See, I got this image in my head. I&#39;ve been trying for days and it just won&#39;t come out. I haven&#39;t really told anyone because umm... well you don&#39;t tell people these sorts of things. I&#39;m not a fan of getting strange looks, or being asked to go see a professional. Although, in the end I guess I am seeing a professional. 

So should I just begin? Alright.

It&#39;s this real poorly lit corridor. Like, it&#39;s supposed to be lined with fluorescent lights but half of them are busted, and the other half weren&#39;t given enough power. Walls and floor are all concrete, and there&#39;s something standing there at the end of the corridor. Looks sort of like a person, but it walks all wrong. I mean, it puts one foot in front of the other, but it just, feels //wrong// you know? Of course you don&#39;t know. That&#39;s why I&#39;m talking to you.

Anyway, the thing, it looks right at me and shrieks. It just lets out something ear splitting. I mean, that could be something carrying over from work. My ears haven&#39;t been right as of late.

What do I do for work? I uh... I work at an accounting firm. But we&#39;re next to this construction site. Right. Yeah sorry, I haven&#39;t been sleeping well. Bit slow on the easy questions.

But back to the... vision? Sure, let&#39;s call it that. I&#39;m on my knees with my hands over my ears. And the thing, it starts //laughing//. Just laughing and laughing. And then more of them appear. And they&#39;re laughing too. Next thing I know I&#39;m in an arena and its just full of these laughing silhouettes that can&#39;t walk right and don&#39;t laugh right either. Like it was some sort of show and they wanted to watch me suffer.

Nah, I don&#39;t need water, but thanks for offering.

I don&#39;t think there was anything more. It was just, weird. I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s the sort of thing that just sticks with you. Like, have you ever been laughed at? I mean, of course you have. Not like— Not like I think there&#39;s something to laugh at you about. That&#39;s not what I meant, no. I just mean that it happens to everyone. It&#39;s probably the fastest way you can hurt someone is to just laugh at them. Makes you think you&#39;ve done something wrong. Normally its humiliating, but when someone&#39;s laughing at you for no reason, its like a combination of that and like... terror? Nah, that&#39;s too strong a word. It&#39;s kinda off-putting, I guess. 

Yeah, off putting is definitely how I would describe it. Like all those people in the stands, they just wanted me to feel bad. Feel miserable. 

I mean, I dunno. Maybe I am depressed? I can&#39;t diagnose shit like that.

Since when did anti-depressants become injections?

No, I don&#39;t think I need any medication.

I said no thank you.

&#34;I&#39;m finished here. Good thing too. I&#39;m all out of the [[[SCP-3000|3000 stuff]]].&#34;

&#34;Yeah, I got the logs too. I know the drill. It&#39;s not like I wiped myself.&#34;

&#34;You know, you need to lay back a little bit. Getting stressed has never done anyone good. Crack a joke every now and then.&#34;

&#34;Well, when [[[SCP-2419|everyone&#39;s laughing at you]]], sometimes you just gotta laugh along. It&#39;s how I dealt with stressful shit like this in my own time.&#34;

&#34;Let&#39;s not go down that rabbit hole now. If you want to talk more about it, buy me a beer.&#34;

&#34;Yeah, see you later man.&#34;
