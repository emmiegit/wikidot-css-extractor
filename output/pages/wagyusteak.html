From their [# Wikidot profile], [[*user wagyusteak]] joined the site on 11 Feb 2021 for undetermined reasons, although online activity suggests their keen interest in reading and writing. Their exact background is near impossible to discern due to their sporadic frequencies in partaking in, if any, discussion related to the SCP Wiki and other miscellaneous matters.

However, on ##red|04/11/2032##,[[footnote]]This page does not yet exist.[[/footnote]] hackers on a discussion forum [# 0chan] reportedly ##red|infiltrated and leaked##[[footnote]]This page does not yet exist.[[/footnote]] some of the user&#39;s personal information, such as their current occupation, location of residence, and their marital status. Relevant authorities immediately took notice and removed the information, although it is now widely known that [[*user wagyusteak]] is currently residing in an undisclosed location in Southeast Asia as a college student enrolled in an unnamed institution. Leaked audio recordings of phone calls made between [[*user wagyusteak]] and their close peers indicate an accent speculated to be of East Asian origin.

[[*user wagyusteak]], according to ##red|some sources##,[[footnote]]This page does not yet exist.[[/footnote]] say that they have not achieved independence from their parents, and has not accrued any income of their own, which some netizens commonly label such individuals as a &#34;[# NEET]&#34;.

[[*user wagyusteak]] has commented the following with regards to queries revolving around the inception of SCP-570 - Rewrite:
[[div class=&#34;oheader red&#34;]]

//&#34;This was a bit of a toughie. It was my first ever rewrite, and I would be lying if I said that I wasn&#39;t tempted to slot snipe a Series I entry. I took way longer than what was required... what was it, one month deadline? I couldn&#39;t keep to that to the fullest extent, but I managed to pump this thing out eventually, I guess. It started out with something a little darker, but I didn&#39;t want to trouble myself too much with such details. More than a few revisions to the entire draft, and here we are.&#34;//

//&#34;A silly little thing I crunched out under Jamcon day 1. The base concept took me back to quite a while ago -- if you haven&#39;t guessed it, it&#39;s just a huge anglerfish that gobbles up capitalists. That&#39;s probably the most succinct I can put it, I think.&#34;//

//&#34;I had the thought of a slaughter store for quite a while, and I imbued the concept of material greed and the attractive power of sales. Some of the people who took a look at this in its early stages apparently reminded them of a typical Black Friday fiasco, which was a pleasant surprise. For this particular one, I wanted to emulate a little bit of [[*user Weryllium]]&#39;s style as part of the Imposter syndrome challenge: short, yet punchy on its own, be it explicitly shown or through implication.&#34;//

//&#34;A bit of a coldpost. Okay, maybe it is a complete coldpost. I was running out of time after endless weeks of procrastination and revamping the draft several times, down to the most mundane of details, like the theme. I borrowed the core concept of one of my not-good SCPs and turned it into some form of a... uh, bureaucratic psychological horror-ish story? It was a real abstract one, and kept massacring my own brain cells over and over on how to convey it in an engaging story. I think I&#39;ll put this on a watchlist for now and see how it goes.&#34;//

//&#34;One of my first works on the wiki, as part of an entry for Cupid con. It&#39;s kind of a personal thing for me, since I tried to picture myself in such a situation and how I feel. I do admit I may have cringed a little when I was trying to write *ROMANCE* because I had zero experience in relationships...&#34;//

//&#34;... I also had no experience working, so I wouldn&#39;t have completely known the daily struggles of an office worker in *hard* oligarchic capitalist society. This would&#39;ve been a literal slice-of-life romcom if not for the ending, yeah. It&#39;s admittedly a little out of place, but I think I&#39;m satisfied, generally. It&#39;s also my first piece to be translated to Vietnamese!&#34;//

//&#34;First entry for the IJAMEA GoI format. I was real excited when I first saw this on the wiki, since I tend to like alternate history and the like. I did struggle with the tone on how the IJAMEA would document anomalies, but I think I managed to get by okay. The core concept was once made into an SCP, but I scrapped it and went full on with IJAMEA instead, because why not? This was actually quite enjoyable to write, since I wouldn&#39;t be so locked in by the clinical tone of SCP articles but simultaneously maintaining that cold, harsh underlying motives behind every instruction.&#34;//

//&#34;Parawatch. Yes. It&#39;s history again, but it&#39;s set in the time of the Vietnam War. My entry for Jamcon day 2, and I know the time when I had to research on a bit of Cambodian mythology and a bit of their culture to give it that feel, you know? I&#39;m personally satisfied with how it turned out, and I enjoyed writing every bit of this, especially if it&#39;s anything *spooky*.//&#34;
