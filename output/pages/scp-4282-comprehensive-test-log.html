||~ Date/Time ||~ Description ||~ Result ||~ Notes ||
|| 02-01-2005 @0930 hours || SCP-4282 is fired by D-22873 in an attempt to reproduce its anomalous property observed in the security footage. || D-22873 is unharmed and no projectile is seen exiting the barrel. || //After this test, it was brought to Foundation attention that an inmate serving time in Escambia County Jail in Pensacola, FL, was struck and killed by a projectile, seemingly from SCP-4282 (this incident has been contained.) The distance between SCP-4282 and the target was approximately ███ kilometers. We are currently cross referencing the inmate&#39;s background with that of the pirate seen in the security footage.// ||
|| 02-10-2005 @1100 hours || SCP-4282 is fired by D-22873 (who has previously been seen not to be affected by SCP-4282) while three D-Class subjects (D-44229, D-56437, D-41315) stand on the firing line at regular intervals. These subjects have been chosen for their similarity to the two previous victims of SCP-4282. || D-56437 is fatally wounded by SCP-4282. All other subjects unaffected. || //Thus far, the only similarities between victim 1 (the pirate), victim 2 (the inmate), and victim 3 (D-56437), are their crimes. Namely, assault and theft of property. Notably, all three of the subjects share crimes that are related in some way to watercraft (piracy, theft of a jet-ski, eco-terrorism of a whaling vessel.)// ||
|| 02-10-2005 @1125 hours || SCP-4282 is fired by Dr. ████ while a D-Class subject with a criminal history similar to the previous victims is positioned on the firing line (D-82281.) D-82281 is fitted with a protective Kevlar helmet. The purpose of this test is to discern whether or not SCP-4282&#39;s bullet can be stopped before killing the victim. || The projectile does not target D-82281 //See [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4282 Incident Report 4282-A].// || //Please refer to the updated testing procedures and Incident Report 4282-A. Dr. ████ has been removed from the SCP-4282 Research Team.// ||
|| 02-15-2005 @1015 hours || SCP-4282 is fired by Dr. Leyland while a D-Class subject with a criminal history similar to the previous victims is positioned on the firing line (D-41167, designated D-1.) D-1 is fitted with a protective Kevlar helmet. D-78221 (designated D-2) is placed in a secondary position on the firing line to intercept the projectile in case SCP-4282 does not target D-1. The purpose of this test is to discern whether or not SCP-4282&#39;s bullet can be stopped before killing the victim. || The projectile strikes D-1&#39;s helmet, preventing his death. || //The protective helmet has proven effective in stopping the projectile. Due to the relative rarity of D-Class subjects that fit the criteria, and at the recommendation of the Ethics Committee, all D-Class involved in testing of SCP-4282 will be fitted with protective helmets.// ||
|| 02-15-2005 @1100 hours || SCP-4282 is fired by Dr. Leyland while the corpse of D-56437 (designated D-1) is positioned on the firing line. D-41167 (from the previous test and designated D-2 for this test) is placed in the intercept position. || The projectile strikes D-2&#39;s helmet, ignoring the corpse of D-1. || //SCP-4282 does not target deceased humans.// ||
|| 02-15-2005 @1240 hours || D-15949 (designated D-1) is positioned on the firing line. D-1 is not guilty of any crimes that would cause SCP-4282 to target him. D-41167 (designated D-2) is placed in the intercept position. D-1 is instructed to break open a locked box with a crowbar and take the model ship (which is functional as a vessel) contained inside. SCP-4282 is then fired by Dr. Leyland. || The projectile strikes D-2&#39;s helmet, ignoring D-1. || //SCP-4282 does not appear to identify models as actual vessels. It is unclear what process or mechanism is behind the apparent &#34;decisions&#34; that are made by SCP-4282.// ||
|| 02-15-2005 @1335 hours || D-15949 (designated D-1) is positioned on the firing line. D-1, as shown in the last test, is not guilty of any crimes that would cause SCP-4282 to target him. D-41167 (designated D-2) is placed in the intercept position. D-1 is instructed to break open a locked shipping container with a crowbar and remove a kayak belonging to Dr. Leyland. SCP-4282 is then fired by Dr. Leyland. || The projectile strikes D-1&#39;s helmet. || //Why SCP-4282 chose to identify the kayak as a vessel, but not the model, is unclear. It may be related to the mass of the object stolen, but that would not explain why SCP-4282 doesn&#39;t target other types of theft. It seems to be able to recognize watercraft in general.// ||
|| 02-16-2005 @1245 hours || The individual parts of SCP-4282 are replicated by machine and replaced systematically to discern which components produce the anomalous effect. || Replacing any component of SCP-4282 with an identical copy causes the firearm to become completely inert, despite being loaded with the proper powder charge and ammunition. The only component in exception to these results was the barrel. || //See [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4282 Incident Report 4282-B]// ||</textarea></pre>
