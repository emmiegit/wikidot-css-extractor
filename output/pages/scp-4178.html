**Item #:** SCP-4178

**Threat Level:** Yellow [[span style=&#34;color:yellow&#34;]]●[[/span]]

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** As of recorded date 09/01/1998, all 19 retrieved instances of SCP-4178 (-1 to -19 respectively) are to be contained in vivariums no less than 10 m x 20 m, with small pools of water and a sandy substrate as interior. Male and female instances are to be contained separately to prevent further mating and the possible death of male instances. SCP-4178 specimens are to be only taken out of their vivarium&#39;s for testing purposes. SCP-4178-20 is kept in a standard containment locker with an internal temperature of -1°C.

Every 2 weeks, no less than 2 Class-D personnel equipped with reinforced apiarist&#39;s suit are to be sent in the chamber to clean and collect any unnecessary webbing produced by the organisms. This behaviour is theorised to prevent web from building up in the abdomen of the instances and thus is considered normal. Any eggs located during cleaning sessions are to be immediately collected and stored in a well-lit freezer with an internal temperature that does not exceed 2º C.

**Description:** SCP-4178 are a species of carnivorous arachnids ressembling members of the //Araneidae//[[footnote]] Family of spiders consisting of orb-weavers.[[/footnote]] family. SCP-4178 possess the abdomen and wings of a //Vespula germanica//[[footnote]]&#34;German Wasp&#34;.[[/footnote]]. Analysis showed that the species of SCP-4178 is one of the largest flying arthropod to have existed, second to //Meganeura moniy//. SCP-4178 specimens have been shown to be able to produce venom in both the stinger and the fangs. Analysis has shown that the venom located in the stinger is much more potent than the venom in the fangs. It has been noted that female members of the species are significantly larger than the males, a common trait seen in regular spider and most wasp species. Male and female individuals have not shown any other sexual dimorphism. 

Instances of SCP-4178 were discovered in the cave of an abandoned village located in Spain, housing a colony of specimens comprising of around 50 individuals. A large hive was recovered along with 20 instances. The rest of the colony was killed during the recovery. Other colonies were discovered in the surrounding area and were subsequently eliminated. A cover scenario was created following the operation.

DNA tests have shown that the SCP-4178 specimens possess a unique kind of DNA. No traces of Vespidae DNA have been found. 
SCP-4178 will leave a stung victim in a state of complete paralysis, followed by an anaphylactic shock after a few minutes. Soon afterwards, multiple instances of SCP-4178 will approach the paralysed prey and will begin secreting a paste-like webbing from their spinneret glands located at the tip of their abdomen under the stinger and will start wrapping the prey with it. This process tends to take up to 40 minutes for humans; larger prey can take up to an hour to be fully covered by the webbing. Solidification of the cocoon usually takes up to 15 minutes. After solidifying, the web takes the appearance of a wasp nest.

SCP-4178&#39;s species can be traced back to 240 million years ago in the middle of the Triassic period through fossil record. These ancestors didn&#39;t possess wings, unlike their modern relatives. Fossils found in █████ in the northern parts of Spain as well as near Santarem, Brazil, shows that these organisms built trapdoors in the floor using the paste-like silk. The first known fossil found with wing markings dates from 140 million years ago, during the late Jurassic era.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Testing Logs&#34; hide=&#34;- Access Authorised&#34;]]

**Experiment Log 4178 - 1**
**Date:** 02/10/20██

**Purpose of the test:** Research SCP-4178&#39;s behavior in the presence of a pompilid wasp.

**Test Subject:** //Pompilidae pepsis// (Tarantula Hawk wasp)

**Test Result:** Seven female instances of SCP-4178 were placed into the testing chamber. Once the SCP-4178 instances settled, ten //Pompilidae pepsis// were added to the testing chamber. Despite SCP-4178 size dwarfing //Pompilidae pepsis//, all SCP-4178s approached them with caution, keeping their distance. After approximately thirty seven minutes since testing began every SCP-4178 instance cornered themselves in the bottom left corner of the testing chamber, showing signs of being distressed and aggravated. Twenty four minutes later testing was discontinued as instances continued to be in this state for the remaining time. Test was repeated on male instances of SCP-4178 with the same result.

//Note: While this may be instinctual behaviour from SCP-4178, it could also be a sign of an expected intelligence level. Further testing with other species has been accepted to expand this theory.//
------
**Experiment Log 4178 - 2**
**Date:** 02/16/20██

**Purpose of the test:** Research SCP-4178&#39;s behavior in the presence of another large Arachnid.

**Test Subject:** //Theraphosa blondi// (Goliath birdeater tarantula)

**Test Result:** 3 SCP-4178 instances were placed into the testing chamber before a single Theraphosa blondi was brought in. Once the //Theraphosa blondi// was placed into the chamber all SCP-4178 instances ignored it, carrying on with their usual activity. Testing finished after 3 hours with no added result. 

//Note: Compared to the test with the Pompilidae pepsis, this was an unexpected result. It has been requested that the Tarantula Hawk wasp test would be repeated but with a longer time duration than before.//
------
**Experiment Log 4178 - 3**
**Date:** 02/19/20██  

**Purpose of the test:** Research SCP-4178&#39;s behavior in the presence of a pompilid wasp for a longer duration.

**Test Subject:** //Pompilidae pepsis// (Tarantula Hawk wasp)

**Test Result:** Test began with the same layout as Experiment log 4178 - 1. As expected the SCP-4178 instances repeated the same behaviour as the previous //Pompilidae pepsis// experiment, placing themselves in the bottom left corner of the chamber. After approximately 4 and half hours of this behaviour, one //Pompilidae pepsis// attacked one SCP-4178, stressing the instances and causing it to fly out of the corner. The instance that was attacked fell and the Pompilidae pepsis advanced onto the SCP-4178, paralyzing the instance. Another SCP-4178 instance flew out of the corner and eliminated the attacking //Pompilidae pepsis//. All other SCP-4178s joined it and attacked the remaining Pompilidae pepsis. The paralysed instance was recovered and monitored, analysis showed that the immunity system of the instance quickly rid the body of the Pompilidae&#39;s venom. 

//Note: This test brought us an interesting fact. SCP-4178&#39;s immunity system appears to be extremely resilient to venom compared to other arthropod and even humans. Further analysis of the biology of SCP-4178 should be made as soon as possible. - Researcher W███//  
------
**Experiment Log 4178 - 4**
**Date:** 02/24/20██

**Purpose of the test:** Research whether SCP-4178 specimens can tell the difference between an inanimate object and a living being.

**Test Subject:** Plastic mannequin representing a young woman, commonly used in clothing display.

**Test Result:** Mannequin was placed in the center of the chamber. SCP-4178 specimen introduced in the room after approximatly 2 minutes. SCP-4178 initiated flight and searched the chamber for 5 minutes before rapidly moving towards the mannequin. SCP-4178 started biting and stinging the mannequin but soon stopped. SCP-4178 proceeded to what appeared to be sensing the mannequin with its stinger. Test ended after SCP-4178 resumed roaming the room for 10 minutes.

//Note: Despite initially showing sign of aggressiveness toward the mannequin, the reaction of SCP-4178 after discovering the prey was not a living being shows a degree of intelligence not shown in most arthropods. It also seems that SCP-4178&#39;s species naturally sees humans as prey, this is deducted by observing SCP-4178&#39;s reaction upon locating the mannequin during flight and landing.//
------
**Experiment Log 4178 - 5**
**Date:** 03/02/20██

**Purpose of the test:** Research SCP-4178&#39;s behavior toward its ancestor.

**Test Subject:** Ancestor of SCP-4178&#39;s species recovered from [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-646 SCP-646], labeled SCP-4178-Ω

**Test Result:** Female instance (designated SCP-4178-14) is introduced to the test chamber. After 5 minutes, SCP-4178-Ω is introduced to the chamber. SCP-4178-Ω is observed drumming for 25 seconds, SCP-4178-14 is soon afterwards observed to start shaking, after which, SCP-4178-Ω started moving toward SCP-4178-14 at a slow pace until fully facing SCP-4178-14&#39;s rear SCP-4178-Ω procceeded to rub his pedipalps on SCP-4178-14 then quickly retreated to a corner of the room; Test ended after 10 minutes of no further movements of the instances. SCP-4178-14 was retrieved and put in a vivarium until she layed an eggsac. The eggsac was quickly recovered. Analysis indicated that all the eggs were infertile. SCP-4178-14 was restored in the female vivarium shortly after. 

//Note: Soon after the test ended, SCP-4178-Ω was placed in the male vivarium and appears to have been accepted by the other instances. It appears that  SCP-4178-Ω&#39;s species used to use both pedipalps to prevent sperm competition between males.// 
------
**Experiment Log 4178 - 6**
**Date:** 03/07/20██

**Purpose of the test:** Study SCP-4178&#39;s behavior toward another large flying arthropod.
Test Subject: //Meganeura brongniarti// recovered from [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3057 SCP-3057]

**Test Result:** 4 SCP-4178 instances were introduced into the testing chamber before a lone Meganeura brongniarti was brought in. Once the //Meganeura brongniarti// was placed into the chamber all SCP-4178 instances ignored it, carrying on with their usual activity. After 15 minutes, the Meganeura charged onto a lone instance (later identified as SCP-4178-20), latching on the back of SCP-4178-20 and proceeding to tear off the wings and abdomen of SCP-4178-20, incapacitating it. The 3 remaining instances soon noticed what happened and started to attack the //Meganeura brongniarti//. Subject soon fell to the floor of the chamber, the twitching of the wings indicated it was still alive at the time. The largest of the SCP-4178 present during the test advanced toward the Meganeura and proceed to remove the head with the use of its fangs. The instances got around SCP-4178-20 and started encasing it in web. After 1 hour of no additional results, the test was ended. The remains of SCP-4178-20 were recovered and stored in a temporary freezer.

//Note: Unlike regular insects, it appears that SCP-4178&#39;s species is capable of feeling sorrow as well as anger when witnessing the death of a member of its species.//

Additional Note: Testing has been suspended following the loss of SCP-4178-20. The reaction of the Meganeura and the death of SCP-4178-20 were not planned and we don&#39;t want to lose any more of the remaining instances. O5-██  [[/collapsible]]

**Addendum 4178.1**: Expedition Log
In 19██, an expedition was sent to investigate a rumor mentioning &#34;the children of the spider goddess&#34; in a secluded region of Brazil was initiated. After several days of searching the surroundings, a hidden precolombian temple was found, supposedly built by an unknown precolombian tribe.

An immediate query sent from commanding officer Researcher W███ demanded two Class-D personnel from Site-███ on immediate transfer, two standard exploration field kits, two wireless headsets capable of recording / transmitting audio – all requests were accepted.

The following video transcript was filmed during the first exploration attempt on the 19th of May 19██. Camera wearers were D-22371 and D-3435.

&gt; 
&gt; //Footage shows subject D-22371 entering the tomb with moderate hesitation stating that “I don’t deal with this voodoo shit.” – Subject was promised extra free-time privileges when relocated back to Site-██  if expedition was conducted – compromise was agreed upon without hesitation and subject enters overhanging doorway to the temple//

&gt; //Connection between Command (Dr. J████ W███) and Class-D’s recording equipment are established – exploration begins //
------
&gt; **Command:** Last microphone and video check before you go in any further, I want you both to wave your hands in front of the cameras and slowly countdown from 10 to 1 in sync, you got that?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3435:** Alright Doc.
&gt; 
&gt; //Both D-3435 and D-22371 complete the task, no technical discrepancies noted and subjects are clear for further entry//
&gt; 
&gt; **Command:** Begin to descend deeper into the temple entrance.
&gt; 
&gt; //After advancing within the temple for a few minutes, connection was lost with Command//
&gt; 
&gt; **Command:** Yo-//[static]// Nearing a chamb-//[static]//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-22371:** Doc? You there? Great we lost coms with the surface.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3435:** Eh who cares. They said we just have to go in and out, shouldn&#39;t take long.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-22371:** True, let&#39;s continue then. You first.
&gt; 
&gt; //After 10 minutes of walking, D-3435 and D-22371 spot an archway with an opening filled with valuable items in the distance. A hallway and one flight of stairs is all that is between them and the items//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-22371:** Holy shit! Is that a fuckin&#39; treasure room?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3435:** Judging by the large stacks of gold I&#39;d say yes.
&gt; 
&gt; //D-22371 is seen running towards the entrance//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3435:** Wait!
&gt; 
&gt; //D-22371 suddenly stops and turns slowly and looks at D-3435. Both stop and face each other//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-22371:** Listen here, I&#39;m just trying to have a bit of fun. I&#39;ve finally got the chance to do something, so I&#39;m gonna make this worthwhile.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3435:** Yeah, well I just don&#39;t trust a temple built centuries ago. It could be falling apart or have like snakes - venomous large snakes - with giant ass fangs an-
&gt; 
&gt; **D-22371:** Stop being so fucking paranoid //(sighs)//.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3435:** Why were we sent in here? Don&#39;t you think they could go themselves?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-22371:** Because they know we are fit for the job.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3435:** //(sigh)// Forget about it.
&gt; 
&gt; //D-3435 begins to walk alongside D-22371//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-22371:** Do you think we&#39;d be able to keep some of the stuff we find?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3435:** I&#39;d imagine not.
&gt; 
&gt; //They begin to walk down the stairs//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-22371:** Meh, I&#39;ll take some anyway, I&#39;m sure no one is gonna notice. Besides it&#39;s not like they will-
&gt; 
&gt; //D-22371 trips on something sticking out of the corner and falls near the bottom of the stairwell while letting out a scream//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3435:** Fuck! Are you alright? What the hell happened?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-22371:** Ah ya bandit! Something touched me.
&gt; 
&gt; //D-22371 gets up slowly//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-22371:** This place is a wreck! I think I hurt my ankle.
&gt; 
&gt; //D-3435 checks at what caused him to trip//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3435:** What on Earth is that?
&gt; 
&gt; //D-22371 grabs his ankle// 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-22371:** What is what?
&gt; 
&gt; //D-3435 gasps//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-22371:** What!
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3435:** I think... I think you tripped on a corpse.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-22371:** Really mate? Its an ancient tomb. Of course there are bodies.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3435:** No... I mean it looks kind of fresh.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-22371:** Huh. Why don&#39;t you go check.
&gt; 
&gt; //D-3435 cautiously returns up the stairs//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3435:** Dude there are like two bodies, they still have skin. Ugh, this is disgusting.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-22371:** Hmm... I wonder what causes that... Is this place cursed or some shit?
&gt; 
&gt; //D-3435 goes back down quickly//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3435:** You think you can walk?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-22371:** Yeah, I&#39;ll be okay. Let&#39;s continue, I hate this place so goddamn much.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3435:** By the way.. I&#39;m gonna guess considering the next room is a treasury, that this place has a ton of traps.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-22371:** Yeah you&#39;re probably right, I don&#39;t want to finish like the two rotting guys up there.
&gt;  
&gt; //After walking down 25 steps, cameras show meticulously drawn symbols into the temple walls – these engravings show men praying, inside a cave, around an altar with a large, paramount being forcing spiders out of its mouth and eyes, the  floating above it. Analysis of these carvings have presented themselves as the prophesied “Arachnid Goddess” – a tribal religious deity heavily worshiped under the act of human sacrifice. Retrieved dated sacred texts have described the goddess as “our mother in skin, in bones and sky, as the one who guides us with the blood path to fortune and we give the baby with sin to her in sting, feast and rape, so we do not suffer the burden of cruel numen”. D-22371 appears distressed although both still walk in silence for approximately 3 minutes before stopping.//.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3435:**  What the hell is that supposed to be?
&gt; 
&gt; //D-22371’s video footage appears to show another carving depicting two people dressed in monk-like attire, apart from the robe being ripped in multiple places on both subjects, gifting a new born child - inside a basket - to the Goddess at the altar.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-22371:** Beats me, was never a religious man myself, could never understand any of it, this just proves my case.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3435:** Doesn’t this kinda’ stuff freak you out? I mean just look at what it’s doing to that poor kid.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-22371:** Come on man, I don’t want to be down here for long either, just man up and continue.
&gt; 
&gt; //Seen via D-22371’s video feed, D-3435 appears to be notably shaken – sweating profusely and looking apprehensive. After 2 minutes D-3435 agrees to proceed and is then seen walking alongside D-22371 with his hand on the wall. After five minutes of walking through the temple a dead end can be seen in the distant footage, D-3435 stops before they can reach it.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3435:** Hey I think I got somethin&#39; here.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-22371:** What is it? We&#39;re practically at the end so we can piss off back to the start and get out of this place.
&gt; 
&gt; //D-3435 begins to push on a part of the wall, which starts to open, revealing a hidden room with two buttons with a design of a wasp and a spider respectively//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-22371:** Christ, this place just gets bigger and bigger, doesn&#39;t it?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3435:** Well, I don&#39;t wanna find out what&#39;s inside so you may take the lead.
&gt; 
&gt; //D-22371 is seen walking towards the buttons, presumably to inspect them//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-22371:** Ha, you scared of some spiders?
&gt; 
&gt; //D-3435 aggressively shakes his head which leads to D-22371 entering first and D-3435 following him soon after into the hidden room.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-22371:** We have some more buttons over here, I&#39;m tempted to press em&#39; but I think this whole place will go temple of doom on us.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3435:** That scientist guy told us to check everything so start pressing them, this place looks old so maybe it won&#39;t do anything and we get to go home.
&gt; 
&gt; //D-22371 seems to hesitate but then presses the two buttons. After a couple seconds of pressing the buttons a piece of the wall moves out of the way to reveal a secret chamber and a light mist arriving at the shins leaks from the chamber//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3435:** What the hell?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-22371:** Alright, uh let&#39;s just tell those scientists back there that this was all we foun-
&gt; 
&gt; //D-22371 stops midsentence and the camera reveals that there is a mumified corpse wearing a jewel around their neck. D-22371 is then seen to slowly wander in//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3435:** Dude what are you doing?!
&gt;  
&gt; **D-22371:** I see somethin&#39; here!
&gt; 
&gt; //As D-22371 gets closer to the corpse the mist begins to lower and starts to reveal a dead instance of SCP-4178 in a curled up position. D-3435 soon notices the dead instance and begins to step away from the entrance// 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3435:** Oh fuck what is that! Dude I need your fucking help!
&gt; 
&gt; //D-22371 successfully approaches the mumified corpse and takes the jewel only to turn around and see the half buried instance of SCP-4178 in the mist//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-22371:** Wow what the fuck is that! [pauses] Wait, I think it&#39;s dead.
&gt; 
&gt; //D-3435 is seen standing by the wall trying to gain some distance from the dead instance//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3435:** Oh yeah? what&#39;s make you think that sherlock.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-22371:** Look at how its leg are curled up, its dead. I used to keep spiders before being sent to jail, I know the body language of the thin-
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3435:** What?! 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-22371:** Dude I get you are scared of spiders and all but come see this shit, the damn thing has wings, and a big ass body! Almost like a hornet!
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3435:** Great, flying fucking spiders. Let&#39;s go back to the surface, I&#39;m not spending anymore time in this hell hole.

After 1 hour and 34 minutes, D-22371 and D-3435 successfully came back to the surface. Analysis of the sacrificial chamber showed that approximately 12 bodies of SCP-4178 were found as well as 36 cocoons found all throughout the temple. Live eggs were found in another hidden chamber within the temple, they seemed to be kept in a sort of stasis by the temperature of the room ranging around 5°C. It is unknown how the tribe managed to keep the room at this temperature.

**Addendum:**
Following the exploration, it was theorised that the temple was built around 1000 year ago. It  appears that the temple was a tribute to the Mayan gods Ah-Muzen-Cab and the Great Goddess of Teotihuacan. [[/collapsible]]
