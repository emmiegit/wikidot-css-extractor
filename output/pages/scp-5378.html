**Item #:** SCP-5378

**Object Class:** Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5378-A and SCP-5378-B were kept in a small enclosure with soil, rocks and various flora. They were fed four raisins per day, and had their container cleaned every week.

**Description:** SCP-5378 is the designation for two sapient ladybird beetles,[[footnote]]Commonly known as ladybugs[[/footnote]] which are referred to as SCP-5378-A and SCP-5378-B. Both instances constructed miniaturized versions of manmade structures and objects using natural materials, such as leaves, rocks, and dirt.

**Addendum 1:** Below is a list of every recorded structure built by SCP-5378-A and SCP-5378-B, as well as the context of their creation. 

||~ Structure Created ||~ Context ||
|| A small tent comprised of two propped-up Rose leaves. || SCP-5378-A and SCP-5378-B had just been contained. ||
|| A sleeping bag made of leaf petioles sown together.|| SCP-5378-A and SCP-5378-B appear to &#34;sleep&#34; together within the sleeping bag for eight hours. ||
|| A separate sleeping bag. || After climbing around the enclosure in what is assumed to be an escape attempt, SCP-5378-A and SCP-5378-B meet outside the tent. They start making harsh buzzing noises at each other. After the altercation, SCP-5378-A makes its own sleeping bag. ||
|| Two two-story cabins. || Probably a result of the former incident. ||
|| A letter etched onto a woodchip. || After nine months since the cabins were created, SCP-5378-A gives the letter to SCP-5378-B at its doorstep. ||
|| A bench made of twigs held together by twine. || SCP-5378-B slowly walks out of its cabin towards SCP-5378-A&#39;s cabin. It taps on the door. When SCP-5378-A comes out, they build the bench and sit next to each other. After an altercation consisting of quiet buzzes, they touch their forelimbs together. ||
|| A heart. || SCP-5378-A and SCP-5378-B combine two leaves into the shape of a heart on the enclosure floor. They both lay in the middle of the heart sideways, holding each other&#39;s limbs. ||

After SCP-5378-A and SCP-5378-B were observed to be unmoving for several hours, they were removed from their enclosure. It was confirmed that SCP-5378-A and SCP-5378-B had expired, most likely due to old age.

**Addendum 2:** Below is the letter mentioned in Addendum 1. It was put under a microscope for comprehensiveness. 

&gt; Hello my sweet Rose,
&gt; 
&gt; My limbs are aching, and the world around me spins uncontrollably. I think this is the end.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m sorry about the altercation we had long ago. Our jailing here wasn&#39;t your fault, and I should have been less harsh.
&gt; 
&gt; Without you, I have been mournful. I miss your touch, and the fluttering of your wings ringing through my ears. I miss traversing through the blue skies with you at my side. Wherever we were, you made it all the better. 
&gt; 
&gt; I figured since we are taking our last breaths, we might as well take them together. We shouldn&#39;t have to die in isolation.
&gt; 
&gt; Please. Let&#39;s talk.
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt; 
&gt; Harold
