**Special Containment Procedures:** Antivirus software in use by the Foundation is to be capable of identifying and blocking requests from SCP-5444. Furthermore, all information relating to SCP-5444-4 is to be backed-up through at least two network-inaccessible mediums.

Instances of SCP-5444-1 are to be stored, unpowered, in an electromagnetically-shielded storage locker. Experimentation, when applicable, is to be conducted under similar conditions, and instances may not be connected to the Site-56 intranet without approval and supervision from the IT Department.

Several instances of SCP-5444-2 are uncontained; Mobile Task Force Kappa-10 (&#34;Skynet&#34;) has been tasked with locating and disabling rogue instances of SCP-5444-2.

SCP-5444-3 is to be kept disassembled and stored in the High Value Containment Wing of Site-56.

**Description:** SCP-5444 is a series of malware programmed in the Yashagorō paralanguage. Metadata analysis has returned largely inconclusive results; it is known that SCP-5444 is 1.32//i// GB in size at most, although metadata relating to its creation and ownership has been extensively obfuscated. The most recent iteration of SCP-5444 was last modified on January 9th, 2018 at 16:15 EST.

Three variations of SCP-5444 are known to exist, each of which is associated with a specific hardware environment.

* SCP-5444-1 are a series of miniature computers of custom make, upon which SCP-5444 has been installed as firmware. All run a bare-metal hypervisor in order to simulate a variety of operating systems, while allowing SCP-5444 to run several iterations at once. A high-end web camera has been installed into the chassis of a single instance, designated SCP-5444-1-Prime.
* SCP-5444-2 is a hypervisor-level rootkit, commonly installed across insecure network connections by SCP-5444-1. Instances otherwise function identically to SCP-5444-1.
* SCP-5444-3 is a humanoid automaton with an artificial intelligence governed by SCP-5444. Unlike -1 and -2, SCP-5444-3 cannot directly interface with a network, and must employ HIDs[[footnote]] Human Interface Devices. [[/footnote]] to perform its intended functions. SCP-5444-3 was powered by an esoteric engine drawing from SCP-████.

When connected to either a database or computer network, SCP-5444 functions as an effectively sapient user. SCP-5444&#39;s primary activities are initially limited to accessing and analyzing as much data as possible; upon the confirmation of data referenced in SCP-5444-4, SCP-5444 will attempt to remove such data through any means necessary.

All variations of SCP-5444 reference SCP-5444-4 through a series of anomalous pointer variables[[footnote]] One of the technical advantages of the Yashagorō paralanguage over nonanomalous languages is the ability to reference variables stored and defined on remote/isolated machines. [[/footnote]]. SCP-5444-4 is a file stored on SCP-5444-1-Prime with a .rysh extension, serving as the primary method of setting SCP-5444&#39;s censorship parameters. Modification of SCP-5444-4 first requires the user to undergo a three-factor authentication process to confirm they are PoI-9522-D.

PoI-9522-D was [[[wwydftltimd-hub|Sara Miriam Yarkoni]]], a 29-year-old Iranian-American freelance programmer with connections to GoI-1285 (&#34;The King of Hearts Collective&#34;)[[footnote]] An independent record label managed by a collective of anartists. [[/footnote]]. According to data recovered from SCP-5444-1-Prime, PoI-9522-D was the sole programmer of SCP-5444-1.

At present, SCP-5444-4 directs SCP-5444 to erase all evidence of PoI-9522-D&#39;s existence.

[[size 150%]]**HISTORY**[[/size]]
[[/=]]

SCP-5444&#39;s existence was brought to the attention of the Foundation on January 10th, 2018, following a string of attacks targeting several individuals of various backgrounds. Although coordinated in such a manner as to suggest a botnet, several attacks displayed unusual complexity. Attacks included, but were not limited to:
* Mass DMCA claims against videos featuring PoI-9522-D and her music.
* Extensive vandalism to several online wikis.
* Specific behavior intended to exploit streaming algorithms in order to sabotage PoI-9522-D&#39;s music&#39;s chances of discovery.
* Blackmail intended to coerce the recipient into deleting files depicting PoI-9522-D from their devices.

Shortly thereafter, Senior Researcher Yehezkel Yarkoni received an email, purportedly from his daughter Sara. Attached was a PDF, ostensibly a handwritten letter, infected with an SCP-5444-2 installer.[[footnote]] The resulting SCP-5444-2 instance has been designated SCP-5444-2-1. [[/footnote]]

Following its installation, SCP-5444-2-1 launched a series of attacks directed at personnel assigned to the GoI-1285 project, as well as Researcher Yarkoni and his wife, [[[SCP-4947|Dr. Rivka Yarkoni]]]. Mobile Task Force Kappa-10 (&#34;Skynet&#34;) was directed to identify, combat, and isolate the threat.

SCP-5444-2-1 was subsequently isolated and neutralized by MTF-κ10 after two hours and fourteen minutes. Researcher Yarkoni was reprimanded for his carelessness and reassigned to [[[SCP-1769|Area-56]]] duty.

[[/=]]

In accordance with the 1966 SoHo Accord, the Foundation required a warrant to raid the residences of PoI-9522-D, on account of her fiance&#39;s registration as a Frequent Resident of BackDoor SoHo. Furthermore, action on part of the Foundation was limited to assisting attendant Unusual Incidents Unit operatives.

[DATA LOST]

Following the acquisition of SCP-5444-3 and all four instances of SCP-5444-1, each of their drives were isolated and imaged, as standard for computer anomalies. According to imaging software, all files pertaining to PoI-9522-D had been deleted at 16:15:54 EST on 10/01/2018, 24 hours after the last modification to SCP-5444-4; as no action had been taken to wipe the associated data, files were successfully restored with minimal effort.

Of interest to the Foundation were several video files recorded on SCP-5444-1-Prime, in which PoI-9522-D discusses the function and background of SCP-5444, as well as updates as appropriate. The last of such videos was recorded at 16:17 EST on 09/01/2018, 19 minutes prior to her estimated time of death.

Excerpted video logs have been provided below. The original files, as well as full transcripts, may be accessed with permission from RAISA; personnel are to be advised of their sexually explicit nature.

**PoI-9522-D:** Heya! Thanks for buying my content, ya little devil!

//PoI-9522-D blows a kiss to the camera, then winks.//

**PoI-9522-D:** If you&#39;re wondering why this came with your purchase, think of this like, well, a EULA. Obviously this is gonna be sexier than reading an EULA, but it still concerns a lot of technical and legal bullshit, and I know not all of you are here for my coding stuff. Bear with me, I&#39;m gonna try making this the easiest EULA possible.

//Turning around, PoI-9522-D makes a show of walking to an office chair in the middle of the room, then settling into it with a relaxed position perpendicular to the backrest.//

**PoI-9522-D:** So, you&#39;re the proud owner of one of my videos, albums, et cetera. That entitles you to several legal rights. First of all, you are entitled to watch it. You are //more// than welcome to watch it.

//PoI-9522-D chuckles, winks, and begins to slowly unbutton her jacket.//

**PoI-9522-D:** Secondly, you&#39;re entitled to download it to any device you own. Do with that whatever the hell you wish, dear. So, what //can&#39;t// you do?

**PoI-9522-D:** Well, you //can&#39;t// upload it anywhere else. Much as I love showing myself off, a girl&#39;s gotta keep work-work and play-work separate. Coming off of that, you can&#39;t bring the real me into BabylonShedim&#39;s[[footnote]] PoI-9552-D&#39;s account on the [# iicameras.drk] streaming service.[[/footnote]] domain, and trust me, I&#39;ll know. Third, and this is one goes out to &#34;[[[filled-to-the-brim-with-girlish-glee|pink fly]]]&#34;, you cannot show any of this to anyone who doesn&#39;t need to know. Again, darling, I&#39;ll know.

**PoI-9522-D:** So, let me be one hundred percent transparent: those files are a bit of an //experiment//. They&#39;re a bit smarter than your typical file, so in addition to carrying the image of me fucking myself raw, they&#39;re a bit shy when it comes to distribution. So, how does this all work?

//Unfastening the last button, PoI-9522-D pauses, then smirks.//

**PoI-9522-D:** Let&#39;s peel back the veil a little.

**PoI-9522-D:** Yeah, you know, I thought it&#39;d be appropriate. I thought, &#34;hey, maybe I should record the announcement on the thing&#34; and the rest is history.

**Kawajiri:** Credit to Veronica, the picture quality is quite good... I mean, sorry. That sounds frustrating.

//Video begins with PoI-9522-D in casual wear, in a different room than her previous videos.//

**PoI-9522-D:** Heya! If you&#39;re wondering why you got this video, I updated the licensing stuff for probably the final time. So, yeah! This video isn&#39;t going to be particularly exciting, and most of the important stuff&#39;s on my profile, so if you&#39;re not looking for a design doc vlog, feel free to skip this one.

**PoI-9522-D:** So, good news and bad news for my long-time fans. Bad news is, I&#39;m sure you already heard, I&#39;m retiring from cam work. Between moving in with my gf and the job I&#39;m starting, I&#39;ve kinda reached a point where I don&#39;t have the time or, really, need to cam anymore. It was fun while it lasted, sure, but a girl&#39;s gotta move on. So, what&#39;s the good news?

**PoI-9522-D:** Well, for starters, all my stuff&#39;s on sale for the next month, including a whole-ass bundle of everything I&#39;ve put out, including the JGT Dev streams and the //much// requested Self-Titled Interview. Second, I&#39;m still gonna do the occasional dev stream, assuming I&#39;ve got the time. Thiiiiiiird...

//PoI-9522-D grins.//

**PoI-9522-D:** Just //wait// til I get to all the cool shit Panoptican&#39;t does now.

//Video opens with PoI-9522-D sitting in an office chair with a downcast expression. PoI-9522-D does not move over the course of three minutes and twenty-eight seconds, although she does occasionally glance at the camera. At 3:28, PoI-9522-D sighs.//

**PoI-9522-D:** I&#39;m sorry. Just trying to get back in the swing of... of this.

//PoI-9522-D remains silent for eight more seconds, before smiling and looking back to the camera.//

**PoI-9522-D:** Hey, glad to see y&#39;all again. Been a while. I know I said I&#39;d be retiring, but...

//PoI-9522-D trails off, remaining silent for ten more seconds.//

**PoI-9522-D:** Eh, it doesn&#39;t matter. Just mind the tip goals and enjoy the show.

//PoI-9522-D engages in sexual intercourse with SCP-5444-3. Two and a half minutes pass before PoI-9522-D abruptly stops.//

**PoI-9522-D:** [//indistinct//], anyway? Oh //bother//.

//PoI-9522-D climbs off of SCP-5444-3, remaining silent for several seconds.//

**PoI-9522-D:** ... I don&#39;t even know. You&#39;re not actually speaking, I didn&#39;t program that. I don&#39;t even know //why// I programmed you, and I hope I never realize why. And I wish I was crazy enough that I could be experiencing delusions, rather than crystal-clear, unambiguous being. That this isn&#39;t just me trying to rationalize a decade of bad decisions. I&#39;m not sure this is helping.

//PoI-9522-D looks up at the camera.//

**PoI-9522-D:** Are you enjoying the show? It&#39;s not real. None of it&#39;s real, not me or the bot or any kiss I&#39;ve blown in the past year. I don&#39;t need or want a fucking robot. I don&#39;t know what I want.

//PoI-9522-D pauses, wiping something from her eye.//

**PoI-9522-D:** I&#39;m tired. Sorry.

//Pushing SCP-5444-3 out of her bed, PoI-9522-D curls into a fetal position and does not move for the remainder of the video.//

//Footage opens with PoI-9522-D staring at the camera. PoI-9522-D opens her mouth to speak, only to begin sobbing. Over the course of three minutes, PoI-9522-D&#39;s sobs grow in intensity, until she&#39;s laying her head face down into the desk. A wire can be seen hanging from the light fixture behind her.//

//At the end of the video, PoI-9522-D looks up at the camera, mouths something indistinct, and ends the recording.//
