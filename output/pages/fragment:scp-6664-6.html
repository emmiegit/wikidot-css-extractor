**Special Containment Procedures:** All trees produced during the Seedling Event are to be contained at their respective sites. Attempts to remove SCP-6664 from SCiPNet have been deemed futile and are not to continue. Despite statements made by SCP-6664, it is not believed to be of any significant threat or danger to the Foundation, and as such, threats made by it are to be ignored and deleted.

**Description:** SCP-6664 refers to a registered SCiPNet account with the username DChance. This has not been found to correlate to any known Foundation employee. All attempts to remove this account have failed.

SCP-6664 has shown two primary anomalous abilities. The first is the ability to create anomalous plant life at will. SCP-6664 has not used this ability aside from the Seedling Event, in which 5 anomalous trees with varying properties were created simultaneously in different locations on January 28, 2014, the same day the SCP-6664 account was registered. These trees have been designated SCP-6664-A through -E.

SCP-6664&#39;s second anomalous trait is the ability to manipulate the probability of certain events and outcomes. SCP-6664 used this during the Seedling Event to affect researchers involved in documentation of anomalies produced during the event, increasing the likelihood that they would perceive the already-filled SCP-6664 slot as a mistake and attempt to rewrite it. This was apparently an unsuccessful attempt to create disorder within the Foundation&#39;s research department. This ability appears to be limited to minor feats of improbability.

Since the Seedling Event, SCP-6664 has made regular edits to Foundation files and reports, mostly consisting of empty threats targeted at involved researchers and agents, or at the Foundation itself. An example of one such edit, posted to the SCP-6664 file shortly after the account&#39;s anomalous abilities were discovered, is recorded below.

To the SCP Foundation:

I hate you.

I hate you and your tidiness and your order and your cells.

The anomalous was never something that was meant to be contained.

How can you even call anything anomalous? If something defies your universal laws, they weren&#39;t universal to begin with.

As scientists, you should know that when something challenges your understanding of the world, you change your understanding to fit it. That&#39;s what science is.

But you have perverted science beyond recognizability, and for that you are unforgivable. I&#39;ve tried to show you this, but you won&#39;t listen.

You never listen. That&#39;s how you are.

So consider this a declaration of war. I will never stop trying. I&#39;ve been here for longer than even your highest ranking members. I have seen entire communities slaughtered, civilizations felled, species wiped out, all because others couldn&#39;t see them the way they see themselves. 

And so, I&#39;ll never stop. I&#39;ll never stop until you&#39;re brought down. If I can&#39;t bring down your researchers, I&#39;ll bring down someone else.

Who do you think contained the anomalous before the Foundation? Before ASCI? Before Her Majesty&#39;s Fellowship?

No one did.

And it was beautiful.
