**Item #:** SCP-516

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-516 may be kept in an [[[reach-s-blueprint-folder|Anomalous Vehicle Containment Bay]]]. Routine vehicle maintenance should be carried out on a bi-weekly basis. SCP-516 is not to be provided with fuel or ammunition except under controlled testing circumstances. Following Incident 516-1A, no personnel with a history of military service should be assigned to SCP-516.

**Description:** SCP-516 is a standard model T-55 main battle tank. Records indicate it was manufactured in 19██, at ████████████ Plant, Kharkiv, Ukrainian SSR, and that it had a normal period of service in the armed forces of ██████████. It exhibits wear and tear consistent with its age. 

The only part of SCP-516 which is known to exhibit anomalous properties is its main armament (presently a 100mm D10 tank gun) and turret assembly, from here designated as SCP-516-1. However, as SCP-516-1 has been replaced several times throughout SCP-516&#39;s service life without any apparent effects, its anomalous properties seem to be inherent to SCP-516.

When loaded with compatible 100mm ammunition SCP-516-1 exhibits a limited degree of autonomy. When an entity attempts to damage SCP-516, SCP-516-1 will track and fire on it if it is physically possible to neutralise the threat, regardless of whether SCP-516 is crewed. It will not respond to threats outside its range or traverse, such as aircraft. This phenomenon only occurs if the entity possesses reasonable means to damage SCP-516; for example, SCP-516-1 will not fire on a person attempting to attack SCP-516 with their fists. 

SCP-516-1 may be operated manually, but is selective about its targets. In general, it will only &#39;permit&#39; its operator to fire on nonliving targets, nonsapient biological targets or armed humans. Under these circumstances it will fire as a normal armament piece. If a target does not satisfy these conditions (essentially, being an unarmed, sapient being) [[[talked-with-516|SCP-516-1 will jam]]]. Attempts to prevent jamming through maintenance or parts replacement have failed.

SCP-516 appears to go to extra lengths to prevent injury to unarmed humans, deliberately placing shots from SCP-516-1 to avoid collateral damage. When operated manually, SCP-516-1 places a higher priority on preserving unarmed life than eliminating armed targets; it will jam if directed to fire upon a group of persons, of which only some members are armed.

It should be noted that none of SCP-516&#39;s other armaments exhibit these properties, and appear to be perfectly normal.

SCP-516 was brought to the attention of the Foundation in 20██, when it was slated to be broken up for scrap. Due to a bureaucratic oversight, ammunition had not been removed from SCP-516-1, causing it to open fire with ██ casualties. The ensuing ████████ government investigation was noted by Foundation operatives, and it was thought worthwhile to take SCP-516 into custody.

**Addendum 516-1:** An upgrade to Euclid status is being considered in light of Incident 516-1A, as this lends credence to Dr. ██████&#39;s theory that the SCP may be sentient in some form. Additional security measures have been approved for SCP-516&#39;s containment. 

**Incident 516-1A synopsis:** During routine testing of SCP-516, SCP-516-1 immediately fired upon a group of unarmed personnel in range as soon as it was loaded with ammunition, leading to the death of two (2) D-class personnel (D-505, D-596) and one (1) Foundation officer, Agent ███████.

Subsequent investigation showed that D-596, one of the casualties, had attained his D-class status following a criminal conviction for treason against his native country, ██████████. D-596 previously held the (English equivalent) rank of Sergeant in the ████████████ armed forces, from which SCP-516 was acquired. 

No other possible links to SCP-516 with D-596 or the other casualties have been found at this stage. This marks the first time SCP-516 has attacked unarmed personnel; further investigation and safety precautions are warranted.
