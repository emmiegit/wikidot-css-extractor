++++* Fandom Stuff


* [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-8600993/7th-annual-holiday-art-exchange The Art Exchange] is back for the 7th year in a row, and it was a wild success! Browse through everything made this year and revel in MANDATORY HOLIDAY CHEER.
* And with that marks another year of Foundation Wiki tyranny, as we pass on into the fabled time of 2019! But before we do, let&#39;s take a quick look back:
 * 1886 articles total were posted this year!
 * [[[SCP-3321]]] was the first article posted
 * ...and [[[The Show Must Always Go On]]] was the last!
 * 16,070 people joined the wiki this year, which means that the admins had to click at least 16,070 times on the &#34;accept&#34; button.
 * And finally, in these 5 past days alone, we&#39;ve already cast 5,819 votes total! 
 * So lets hope for an even greater 2019!
* [http://www.scp-wiki.net/cliche-con-2019 Cliche Con 2019] - The first contest of 2019 has started! So get out there and start writing generic humanoids with dark, mysterious pasts! (Note: mileage may vary) 
* [http://scp.bz/2018survey The 2018 Survey] is up and we want you (yeah you!) to fill it out!
++++* Featured Articles

* [[[SCP-3305]]] (&#34;The Father, The Son, and The Holy Toast&#34;) by Captain Kirby - BREAD JESUS RISES
* [/how-dr-clef-contained-christmas How Dr. Clef Contained Christmas] by LurkD, narrated by Doctor Cimmerian - Santa, Site 19, Dr. Clef! What better combination could you have? (Note: May or may not contain Santa, Site 19, or Dr. Clef)
* [/you-and-me Track 4: You and Me] by djkaktus, recorded by Oboebandgeek99 - I&#39;ll wander round the cosmos, weeping and waiting/Waiting to be with you.


++++* Event Featured Articles

The theme for the month of November was //Clockwork!//

* In [[[SCP-1661]]] (&#34;Gremlins&#34;), rewritten by shaggydredlocks, original by Adam Henderson, mechanical gremlins are prevented from doing their mechanical gremlin thing. Antics ensue.
* In [[[SCP-3221]]] (&#34;Prester John the Unbroken&#34;), by modern_erasmus and tufto, a man split down the middle in body, soul, and religion is encountered. 
* In [[[SCP-3662]]] (&#34;The Doomsday Clock&#34;), by Ayers, a clockwork heart tells lies of redemption, spreading sadness in its wake.

You will notice little &#39;📈&#39; emojis besides some articles. That denotes SCP articles which were under 30 and tales which were under 20 when this edition of site news was posted. Give them a little love! Speaking from personal experience, the most frustrating thing that can happen to an article is not deletion, but stagnating below 20 without any comments. So try to read, vote, and comment on these articles! They&#39;re often hidden gems :)

+* Q&amp;A:

++* Q: Can I replace a blurb that you wrote for one of my articles with my own? I&#39;m not satisfied with it.

A: Absolutely. You will always have that option at any point.

++* Q: I noticed an error/typo/incorrect information and wish to correct it. May I?

A: Sure! If the changes are not limited to your own article(s) and/or are substantial changes across multiple entries, you should post in that month&#39;s discussion page and then make the changes.

++* Q: I wrote an article and it seems to have stuck. Can I send a blurb of mine to one of the frequent collaborators?

A: Yup! It&#39;s much easier if you come to us about it, and it gives you the control over what you want shown on the news page.
