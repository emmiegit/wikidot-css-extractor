&gt; If you like my work - if it made you chuckle, made you think, made you sad, made you happy, consider being a [https://www.patreon.com/ZacharyMaxwell Patron.] 
&gt; 
&gt; My work will **never** be behind a paywall, and will only be enhanced by any Patrons who care to support my efforts here, based on tier rewards from a very reasonable price. It is much appreciated if you even read my work, let alone want to support a (sometimes literally) starving artist. This is not a requirement, and becoming a Patron is not guaranteed to speed up my work, which I would never promise anyway. I will always write for the fun of it first, but any help you can offer if my Tales have entertained you is much appreciated.

__What&#39;cha Up To, Maxwell?__

--Always working on new content at the moment.-- Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.

Studying a creative writing degree with Chinese on the side that is slowly taking over his life and leaving him as a husk who can only over-analyse society. **Also has writer&#39;s block because life is a bitch.**

Very concentrated on horror-based art at the moment; if you&#39;re interested, please see my [http://www.scp-wiki.net/maxwell-s-magnificent-art-crapfest art page.]</textarea></pre>
