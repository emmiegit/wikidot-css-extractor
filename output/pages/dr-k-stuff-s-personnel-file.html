Whoops, it looks like this page is undergoing
+ [[SIZE 300%]]MASSIVE REVISIONS[[/size]]
and you stumbled into it mid-development! Please excuse the nonsense.

So, for anyone surprised, yea! My author page is undergoing massive revisions. Why? Well, I have been meaning to reorganize my author page for a //long// time. Like, a long, long time. Years, I think. And, due to the [[[Art Exchange Hub|Art Exchange]]] (go sign up before it&#39;s too late, go do it, do it now!) I was reminded of a tale that I //forgot I even wrote//. Part of forgetting that I wrote it was that it wasn&#39;t on my author page, and I realized, shit, that&#39;s where people can go to see stuff that I&#39;ve written, if it&#39;s not there no one&#39;s gonna find it! I know for a fact that people do actually see my author page. I got a PM about it recently, from a low-karma person no less, so I know this is a useful thing to keep updated (not to mention having it nice and neat would //soothe// my //psyche//).

Anyhow, putting that tale, and a couple other things that aren&#39;t on my author&#39;s page, onto my author&#39;s page would require following the format I had previously laid out for myself, and that&#39;s part of the things I wanted to change, so I had no motivation to do that... but... I do, now, have extra motivation for changing up my author&#39;s page.

Hopefully that clears some things up! For the time being, if you want the old author page, you can just use the History button down at the bottom, and if you want a complete list of everything I have written (the main use of an author page), you can have it here, in strict alphabetical order.

No, this //isn&#39;t// the best way to show all of my work. But it has one thing over my previous author&#39;s page; it actually has everything on it! Well, except hubs... no wait, now it does. If you came here looking to start up one of my series (or visit a canon of mine, or see a GoI I have made) then here you are:

The real version of this author page //should// be ready and updated --before the New Year or shortly thereafter-- (you should never trust my schedules, please never trust my schedules). Please deal with this compromise in the meantime~!

Oh also, I really liked this idea, so here, there are some badges I have earned:
