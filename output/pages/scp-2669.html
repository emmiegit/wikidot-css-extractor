**Item #:** SCP-2669

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** The Khevtuul 1 Command Center has been established within the Foundation Office of Celestial Anomalies for the purposes of maintaining contact with and, when circumstances permit, control over SCP-2669. All available resources within the Khevtuul sub-program of [[[Project Heimdall]]] have now been redeployed with the aim of increasing the distance between SCP-2669 and Earth to the maximum extent feasible. All periods in which SCP-2669 is under control of the Khevtuul 1 Command Center are to be used in furtherance of this goal. Staff are to disregard prior mission parameters. 

Due to the potential for high numbers of D-Class personnel being required for SCP-2669 containment, the Foundation Logistics Department has been authorized to establish a specialized recruitment program dedicated to personnel for SCP-2669. This program is tentatively approved to begin operations at Ar Ramtha Refugee Camp in Irbid Governorate, Jordan, under the established &#34;Mercy International Adoption Services&#34; front organization. 
   
**Description:** SCP-2669 is the Khevtuul 1 space probe, designed, constructed and launched clandestinely by the Foundation in 2004 as part of extraterrestrial threat assessment protocols mandated by [[[Project Heimdall]]]. SCP-2669&#39;s initial mission was the direct observation of exoplanets believed to be capable of harboring Earth-analogous life forms, a function beyond mainstream scientific capabilities for the foreseeable future.  

SCP-2669 utilizes two capabilities not attainable with currently understood technology:

* __Effective faster-than-light (FTL) travel.__ Research and adaptation of three exotic propulsion systems found within [[[SCP-2117]]], believed to operate by locally distorting space-time, yielded an experimental drive capable of enabling a small probe to travel at relative speeds of up to (and in some cases exceeding) approximately 5.3//c//. Due to the immense destructive potential of such a drive, clearance for use was granted exclusively to Khevtuul 1. 

* __Instantaneous communication and control.__ Khevtuul 1 was designed with an augmented flight computer system incorporating a human consciousness-integrated Command-Data-Guidance-Control (CDGC) system. Study and adaptation of the remote mind-body linking phenomenon behind [[[SCP-2372]]] has enabled a form of human consciousness upload into an electronic interface. The presence of a separated human consciousness linked to a corporeal body on Earth has enabled the transfer of information from Earth to the location of Khevtuul 1 to occur on an instantaneous basis, regardless of relativistic distance. This attribute enabled the enhanced degree of control necessary to operate a space probe beyond the boundaries of the Solar System at the needed operational capacities for the mission.  

During its period of full Foundation control and mission functionality, Khevtuul 1 directly surveyed 114 exoplanets. The results of that survey remain classified. 

SCP-2669 is host to the consciousness of D-43852 (the former Dr. Asma Tareen). D-43852 exerts autonomous control over the probe, and is actively seeking to return to Earth. Due to the potential of a collision between Earth and a relativistic object resulting from this intention, containment procedures have been established to prevent the return of SCP-2669 to Earth.  

Experimentation has shown that uploading the consciousness of another subject simultaneously disrupts D-43852&#39;s control over SCP-2669. In the absence of interference from D-43852, backup software is able to resume control over SCP-2669&#39;s propulsion systems, which have been programmed to continue the probe on its originally planned course travelling indefinitely away from Earth. However, D-43852 has proven capable of removing additional subjects from SCP-2669, though this process typically takes several weeks. The eventual fate of additional D-Class subjects uploaded to SCP-2669 is not understood at present. 

Because of the nature of the upload process, the use of D-Class subjects recruited outside the specialized program listed above is now prohibited.

**Addendum 2669.1 - Khevtuul 1 Survey Results**

//Researcher&#39;s Note: The following is a representative sampling of exoplanets visited by SCP-2669. The attached information is a summary of findings; detailed records may be accessed with permission by the Office of Celestial Anomalies.//

|||||| **Gliese 832 c** ||
||~ Distance from Earth ||~ Initial Heimdall HE Probability ||~ Findings ||
|| 16 light-years || 17% probability of advanced civilization || No signs of current life; no evidence for previous inhabitation ||
|||||| **Observational Notes:** Unsurprising, given the initial chemical indicators that were in the mission file. The atmospheric readings have confirmed the presence of high amounts of oxygen, however, upon closer inspection, these appear to be related to other chemical processes occurring at the planet&#39;s surface. No electromagnetic signals or evidence of structures. But we weren&#39;t likely to strike gold on the first try anyway. ||

|||||| **Kepler-186f** ||
||~ Distance from Earth ||~ Initial Heimdall HE Probability ||~ Findings ||
|| 560 light-years || 33% probability of advanced civilization || No signs of current life; no evidence for previous inhabitation ||
|||||| **Observational Notes:** It&#39;s hard to say I am disappointed. I cannot understate the immense awe of being able to directly observe places that I never thought humans could reach. But given how similar in size to Earth this planet is, I was hoping to see more signs that, if life weren&#39;t present now, that it could have arisen at some point. No chemical indicators, even for bacteria, present. On to the next candidate. ||

|||||| **K2-9b** ||
||~ Distance from Earth ||~ Initial Heimdall HE Probability ||~ Findings ||
|| 359 light-years || 41% probability of advanced civilization || No signs of current life; no evidence for previous inhabitation ||
|||||| **Observational Notes:** I know command thinks it&#39;s odd that I keep hoping to find something. Are you all so removed from the mundane sciences that you&#39;ve forgotten what a shocking discovery the existence of extraterrestrial life would be? Yes, I understand the risk assessment arguments. But as inspiring as it is out here, it&#39;s lonely. I still can&#39;t understand how there isn&#39;t even an //atmosphere// here. How could the readings have been so inaccurate? ||

|||||| **KOI-4427 b** ||
||~ Distance from Earth ||~ Initial Heimdall HE Probability ||~ Findings ||
|| 782 light-years || 19% probability of advanced civilization || No signs of current life; no evidence for previous inhabitation ||
|||||| **Observational Notes:** I appreciate you allowing me to travel to this one. Having a part in the mission decision-making process is helping. We didn&#39;t expect much here, and naturally we didn&#39;t find anything. I&#39;m glad that these results are reassuring to command. I&#39;ll keep looking. I&#39;m making a formal request here for someone to do a review of the software. I feel like I&#39;m hearing faint, barely audible background noise. That shouldn&#39;t be possible, should it? Hearing anything? ||

|||||| **Kepler-442b** ||
||~ Distance from Earth ||~ Initial Heimdall HE Probability ||~ Findings ||
|| 1,120 light-years || 78% probability of advanced civilization || No signs of current life; no evidence for previous inhabitation ||
|||||| **Observational Notes:** How can there be nothing out here? It was rocky, just like the theorists predicted. And those SETI signals, the ones that were so strong that your people suppressed them? How can that have come from a dead, frozen rock? I have nothing to do but run tests and observations, as someone without a body. But I ran those atmospheric results until I was exhausted. Did you know that it&#39;s possible, by the way? Fatigue without body. I hadn&#39;t considered that. God, something to collect data about, other than rocks and abstract chemical reactions. I long for that. Give me something to discover. ||

||~ Distance from Earth ||~ Initial Heimdall HE Probability ||~ Findings ||
|| 1,750 light years || 3% probability of advanced civilization || No signs of current life; no evidence for previous inhabitation ||
|||||| **Observational Notes:** I don&#39;t wake up and I don&#39;t go to sleep anymore. I have no reckoning of time. It&#39;s only been several years back at command. It feels like it&#39;s been centuries out here, briefly interrupted by dead rocks. Nobody thought this would be the one, a gas giant not even in a habitable zone, but I dreamed. Fantastic organisms, adapted for atmospheric existence in extreme conditions, diaphanous creatures subsisting on forces we haven&#39;t even conceived. Would they even have need of communication? I&#39;ve spent decades thinking of what they could be like. But there&#39;s nothing. I&#39;m hearing things again. ||

|||||| **Kepler-443b** ||
||~ Distance from Earth ||~ Initial Heimdall HE Probability ||~ Findings ||
|| 2,540 light years || 53% probability of advanced civilization || No signs of current life; no evidence for previous inhabitation ||
|||||| **Observational Notes:** Do you have any idea how absurd it looks from out here? Fear that an alien civilization is coming for a barely perceptible speck in the endless sea. Ridiculous. The light you see from this star is older than Jesus, and you think that there was something here, plotting against you? I have nothing to laugh with, or I would. I feared my body becoming a prison. You were eager to point that fate out to me, as we talked. You have it still, my body. I wish you would burn it. Knowing that it exists out there still is torment that you can&#39;t understand. ||

|||||| **Observational Notes:** You&#39;re going to push me out further, forever, aren&#39;t you? This will never stop. I can tell you already. There&#39;s nothing out here. It&#39;s just us. You know that too, but you need an ever-larger sample size. It&#39;s only us, alone in eternity. Pull the plug on me. Please. You can&#39;t have any idea what this is like. Grasping at nothing. Forever. ||

I know it can&#39;t be them, because there is nothing here. This is a flaw in my interface. That&#39;s all I really need. //Researcher&#39;s Note: This is the last transmission related to the Khevtuul 1 mission, prior to the probe going offline.// ||

**Addendum 2669.2 - SCP-2669 Mitigation Summary**

After the transmission of data from PSR B1620-26 b, Khevtuul 1 went offline and was unresponsive for a period of 21 days and three hours. D-43852 was considered KIA, and Khevtuul 1 was considered to be a lost asset. 

On ██/██/██, mission control re-established contact with Khevtuul 1. Data indicated that the probe had changed course, and was moving on a direct path of return to Earth. The destructive potential of the probe striking Earth at relativistic speed necessitated a reordering of the Khevtuul 1 Command Center&#39;s mission to prevent its return to Earth at all costs. 

Additionally, D-43852 appeared to have taken effective control of the probe&#39;s command functions upon reestablishment of contact. Attempts to override this control through accessing software systems failed. On ██/██/██, clearance was granted to attempt a re-uploading of an alternative consciousness in an effort to either disrupt control of Khevtuul 1 or establish a new controlling system that would be responsive to Foundation commands. 

The program used to initially recruit D-43852, voluntary in nature and reliant on substantial amounts of compensation to survivors and institutions identified by D-43852, was determined to be too slow to be suitable for procuring a subject for this measure. Based on previous parameters deemed necessary for integration into the Khevtuul 1 command system, on ██/██/██ identified Dr. Peter Westly as an ideal subject, based on qualifications, advanced age, and previous statements in support of so-called &#34;transhumanist&#34; technology. Of note was Dr. Westly&#39;s primary specialization in orbital mechanics; this was believed to make Dr. Westly more able to take effective control of Khevtuul 1 than D-43852, who had previously specialized in exobiology. 

Dr. Westly (now D-61181) was successfully uploaded to Khevtuul 1 on ██/██/██. This was followed by the probe reverting to &#34;safe mode&#34; command status, enabling researchers to alter its course to a point in the center of the NGC 1560 galaxy, approximately 11.2 million light-years distant.

After three months, contact was lost once more with Khevtuul 1, before almost immediately being re-established. The presence of D-61181 could not be detected, and the entity residing within Khevtuul 1 once more established control. The route D-43852 plotted back towards Earth after this event was observed to be approximately 37% more efficient than the previous route; this is believed to be related to the orbital mechanics expertise of D-61181.

Authorization was granted to repeat the re-uploading procedure, and subsequent completions of this procedure have similarly interrupted control of Khevtuul 1 and enabled Foundation staff to readjust its course. 

On ██/██/██, after the fifth iteration of the re-uploading procedure, researchers were able to access data appearing to be sporadic records of interaction between D-43852 and other subjects uploaded to Khevtuul 1. These records are currently classified. Based on this data, future D-Class subjects used for containment procedures have been restricted to specialized, project-specific criteria.
