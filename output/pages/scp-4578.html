**Item #:** SCP-4578

**Object Class:** Keter

**Threat Level:** [[span style=&#34;color:yellow&#34;]]●[[/span]] Yellow

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4578 is kept in an externally reinforced humanoid containment cell in a bunker two kilometers below Site-59. The cell is to be regularly stocked with approved meals, books, and a sajjāda[[footnote]] Islamic prayer rug. [[/footnote]]. At no point is SCP-4578 to come within one kilometer of the onsite nuclear warhead, nor is SCP-4578 to be made aware of the warhead.

Personnel assigned to SCP-4578&#39;s containment and upkeep are to be trained in ASL and unarmed at all times. SCP-4578 is not to be issued orders unless they are phrased in the form of a polite request in sign language. No hostility, physical or otherwise, is to be displayed towards SCP-4578.

In the event of an emergency at Site-59, SCP-4578 is to be relocated to Area-4578.

Should an SCP-4578-1 event occur, all personnel are advised to stand down until the event is over, then return SCP-4578 to safety at his own will.

**Description:** SCP-4578 is a 35-year-old man of West African descent named Girard Sebastien Niang. Due to the noise produced by SCP-4578-1 events, SCP-4578 is completely deaf. He is believed to be our reality&#39;s multiversal iteration of the leader of the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/three-moons-initiative-hub Three Moons Initiative], who is also named Girard Sebastien Niang.

SCP-4578 has a tattoo of three crescent moons on the back of his neck, hereafter SCP-4578-1. Though he regards tattooing as against his religion, SCP-4578-1 generated on his body against his will when he turned 30 years old.

When another living thing[[footnote]] Once believed to be only humans, but SCP-4578 has reported a reaction to a wild dog attack prior to containment. [[/footnote]] attempts to take hostile action[[footnote]] As of Incident-4578-518, direct orders to SCP-4578 have been determined to be a form of &#34;hostile action.&#34; [[/footnote]] against SCP-4578, SCP-4578-1 transforms into a small pocket-dimensional gateway that deploys SCP-4578-2, a heavy-caliber machine gun turret mounted on a robotic arm. The deployment process takes approximately 0.04 seconds from reaction to firing. Upon successful neutralization of the threat, SCP-4578-2 will retract into its pocket dimension.

SCP-4578-2&#39;s destructive capabilities are not yet entirely understood, save for the following information, gleaned from testing:

* It can fire up to 4,000 armor-piercing rounds per minute.
* Projectiles are 2 centimeters in diameter and made of an indestructible crystalline substance of likely extradimensional origin.
* Projectiles have a &#34;flesh-loosening&#34; effect on contact with organic tissue; that is, bonds between cells will immediately separate, resulting in victims appearing to fall apart.
* The barrel of the gun is engraved with &#34;☽☽☽ HDC-49SS &#39;EL DEGÜELLO&#39; -- WARNING: TAMPERING WITH THIS DEVICE IS A CLASS M DAMNABLE FELONY AND WILL RESULT IN EXPEDITED OUBLIETTIFICATION -- GLORY TO JALAKÅRA&#34;.

Despite this, SCP-4578 abhors violence, and manifestations of SCP-4578-2 have resulted in severe psychological trauma. 

**Recovery Log:** After several activations of SCP-4578-1, SCP-4578 turned himself into law enforcement authorities in Dakar, Senegal. His anomalous qualities were noticed by Foundation agents in the field and he was transferred to Site-59 on 1/9/2017.

**Addendum -- ☽☽☽ Initiative Involvement:** On 1/10/2017, after the establishment of SCP-4578&#39;s containment, [[[SCP-2578]]]-D, the Foundation&#39;s primary contact with the ☽☽☽ Initiative, was contacted via e-mail by Dr. Naismith for an explanation. The reply was as follows:

&gt; ☽☽☽ apologizes; it appears that due to jurisdictional oversight and DNA similarities, this fellow shares some of the Eternal President&#39;s Secret Service Protections. This weapon is designed to permanently incapacitate immortals, and its presence in Iteration 2L is offensive and inappropriate. ☽☽☽ will have this problem completely addressed within the hour.

One hour after the reply was received, Site-59 was damaged by a football-sized meteorite. Inspection of the meteorite revealed that it was a parcel addressed to SCP-4578, containing an index card reading &#34;COMPENSATION&#34; and one kilogram of diamonds. SCP-4578&#39;s anomalous qualities remain unchanged.
