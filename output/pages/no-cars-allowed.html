&#34;Uh, sir?&#34;

&#34;Yes, agent?&#34;

&#34;Well... it&#39;s just... you know about [[[three-portlands-hub|Three Portlands]]], right sir? All the agents stationed there?&#34;

&#34;Three Portlands is our main responsibility, agent. Stop asking dumb questions.&#34;

&#34;Right, but... they&#39;ve detected something... unusual, sir.&#34;

&#34;Do you even know what our acronym stands for? //Unusual// Incidents Unit?&#34;

&#34;Yes, sir, yes, and--&#34;

&#34;Spit it out already!&#34;

&#34;There&#39;s a car, sir.&#34;

&#34;What?&#34;

&#34;In Three Portlands.&#34;

&#34;A... car? But--&#34;

&#34;Yes, sir, there should be no cars in Three Portlands. But one is there. Right in the middle of the city, sir.&#34;

&#34;What the fuck?&#34;

------

&#34;You know, agent, I thought you were joking when you told me about this.&#34;

&#34;I do not joke around, sir.&#34;

&#34;A yellow smart car. Whoever managed to get it in here clearly has no style.&#34;

&#34;Well, you know what they say about smart cars, sir?&#34;

&#34;Yes? What do they say?&#34;

&#34;That was a question, sir. I do not know what they say about smart cars.&#34;

&#34;...alright then. Agent, do you have any witness accounts of how this car arrived here?&#34;

&#34;It appeared in the sky, sir. And then it fell.&#34;

&#34;Has anyone checked if there is a Way up there?&#34;

&#34;Yes, sir, and there is not.&#34;

&#34;Interesting...&#34;

&#34;Now, uh, sir. Before we start thinking too hard, I believe we should perhaps try and find a way to get this car out.&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s not doing any harm, is it, agent?&#34;

&#34;Civilian unrest, sir. They don&#39;t like cars-- except for that food truck down the street.&#34;

&#34;There&#39;s a food truck here?&#34;

&#34;Yes, sir. They sell very good tacos. It, however, does not move.&#34;

&#34;I will take note of that, agent. Now, back to the issue at hand.&#34;

&#34;Of course, sir. I think that if we push the car from behind, we could move it over to a Way.&#34;

&#34;Push it?&#34;

&#34;Well, we can&#39;t call a tow truck.&#34;

&#34;Right you are, agent. Hm. You&#39;ve got me thinking: why //are// there no cars in Three Portlands?&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m not sure, sir. Perhaps they&#39;re worried about infrastructure? Roads //are// expensive. Plus, it&#39;s not like the city is that big anyways...&#34;

&#34;You make good points.&#34;

&#34;Of course I do, sir, I always do.&#34;

&#34;Let&#39;s not inflate that ego too large, agent.&#34;

&#34;Just trying to keep a sense of humor, sir.&#34;

&#34;Hm. Anyways... let&#39;s move this car out of here.&#34;

&#34;I hope you&#39;re ready to push, sir.&#34;

&#34;I&#39;ve been sitting in an office chair for the past three weeks, agent. What do you think is the answer to your question?&#34;

------

&#34;Sir, a report came in from Three Portlands, and--&#34;

&#34;Another car?&#34;

&#34;No, sir, they actually caught the one responsible for making the cars.&#34;

&#34;Oh?&#34;

&#34;Yes, sir. It was an anartist from Are We Cool Yet? She managed to open her own Way, where she snuck car parts in one-by-one before putting them back together again.&#34;

&#34;Was this some kind of symbolistic movement?&#34;

&#34;From our fairly short interview with her, yes. Here&#39;s a transcript.&#34;

&#34;...why are there so many expungements? Did you use one of the black highlighters on accident?&#34;

&#34;Ah, no sir, they were just a bit too vulgar to include.&#34;

&#34;The only words she spoke that aren&#39;t expunged are &#39;cars&#39; and &#39;motor-oil guzzlers.&#39;&#34;

&#34;Truly the mark of a powerful artistic movement, sir. The interviewing agent said that he almost let out a tear.&#34;

&#34;Interesting. Well, agent, this situation is dealt with then, correct?&#34;

&#34;Yes, sir. I just-- ah, excuse me, for a moment, I need to take this call.&#34;

&#34;No worries.&#34;

&#34;Thank you. Hm? You-- wait. Slow down. What did you find? Ah. Hm. I&#39;ll let him know immediately, yes sir.&#34;

&#34;So, what did they find, agent?&#34;

&#34;A, um, gas station, sir.&#34;

&#34;Oh lord... This is going to be a lot of work...&#34;

&#34;Yes, I don&#39;t think we can just push this one away, like all of our other problems there, sir.&#34;

&#34;Right. Well, agent, why don&#39;t we--&#34;

&#34;Ah! Apologies, sir, looks like they&#39;re calling again. Hm. Okay, and? Oh. Wait, they&#39;re... well. Uh, thank you. Yes, I&#39;ll let him know.&#34;

&#34;What now?&#34;

&#34;A riot, sir.&#34;

&#34;Oh God, why?&#34;

&#34;Well, the citizens are worried about infrastructure, sir, becau-&#34;

&#34;Heh. Infrastructure, looks like you were right on point earlier, agent.&#34;

&#34;Yes sir, but something else has happened as well.&#34;

&#34;Something else?&#34;

&#34;All the bikes in the town, uh, transformed into cars... uh, sir? What&#39;s that bottle?&#34;

&#34;Whiskey.&#34;

&#34;Ah... can I have some as well?&#34;

&#34;Of course, agent.&#34;

&#34;Thank you.&#34;

&#34;God, I hate my fucking job.&#34;

&#34;Well, sir... we all do.&#34;
