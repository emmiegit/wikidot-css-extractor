||||~ OFFICIAL ETHICS COMMITTEE MEMORANDUM ||
||~ From: || Dr. Adileh Khayyam, Site-43 Psychologist and Humanoid Anomaly Specialist ||
||~ To: || Dr. Jeremiah Cimmerian, Ethics Committee Liaison ||
||~ Re: || Harrassment of Dr. Scott Fletcher ||
||~ Attachments: || 18 files ||
|||| Dear Dr. Cimmerian, _
  _
  As an Ethics Comittee Liaison, you of all people should be aware of the stresses that Foundation personnel face when it comes to working with the anomalous and the conditions that they face on a day-to-day basis. That being said, despite the Ethics Committee&#39;s continual work to maintain a healthy organisational culture, the repeated claims of endemic bullying and harrassment continue, with one of the most striking examples of such a case being that of Dr. Scott Fletcher. _
  _
  Attached is a log of a number of communications which I feel are demonstrative of the toxic culture currently being perpetuated with regards to the organisation of the Foundation as a whole. Dr. Fletcher is only one case, but his is one of the most significant cases I have had during the past six months of my tenure at Site-43. While I have seen many cases of psychological trauma across my work at the Foundation, Dr. Fletcher&#39;s remains a significant case because of how emblematic he is of the problems Foundation staff face with regards to mental health and wellbeing. _
  _
  Suffice it to say in my personal opinion that if this pattern of harrassment and mistreatment continues without serious intervention on the part of the Ethics Committee, Dr. Fletcher&#39;s case is only going to be one of many the Department of Psychology will have to deal with. _
  _
  Kind regards, _
  _
  Dr. Adileh Khayyam ||

  I know you probably won&#39;t read this until you come back to your office in a few weeks, but when you do get around to reading this, I want to talk to you. If you don&#39;t want to talk to me, that&#39;s fine, but I saw you in the hall a couple of days ago. To put it kindly, you really look like you need to talk to somebody. Whether or not that person&#39;s me, I don&#39;t care, but please. _

  Get better soon. _

= **Excerpt of Post-Incident ███-███ Analysis Report**

----

&gt; ...In this case, evidence would seem to suggest that D-11938 and Agent Ari Bayer were cooperatively responsible for the neutralisation of the anomaly formerly designated as SCP-███. D-11938 and Agent Bayer&#39;s remains have been reinterred outside Site-43 following incineration to prevent possible contamination of the surrounding site. Given the negligence involved in the testing of SCP-███ with a lagomorph, Site-43 personnel have been issued a reminder as to the danger of careless testing with regards to biological anomalies. Senior Researcher Jill Richards has been disciplined for her involvement in the test and placed on a probationary period given her history with unnecessary testing...
&gt; 
&gt; ...D-11938 is survived by her daughter, Eileen Cross, while Agent Bayer is survived by his husband, Dr. Scott Fletcher. A private ceremony for both individuals will be held on the 28th of August, with selected members of staff invited to attend alongside Dr. Fletcher and Ms. Cross.

&gt; **Dr. Adileh Khayyam:** Hello?
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Alex Marshall:** Hey, Doc.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Khayyam:** Hi, Alex. Is this to arrange an appointment?
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Marshall:** Nah. I just wanted to check in with Scott.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Khayyam:** What do you want to know?
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Marshall:** I wanted to know how he&#39;s been, you know?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Khayyam:** He doesn&#39;t look well.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Marshall:** Really?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Khayyam:** Mister Marshall, to put this bluntly, I met him the other day at a restaurant when I was out on my lunch break. He bought a salad, didn&#39;t eat for the entire time I was talking to him and he left to go to the bathroom for about a quarter of an hour before he paid the bill. I would not consider that &#34;healthy&#34; behaviour.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Marshall:** Um. Wow, that&#39;s a lot worse than I thought. It&#39;s just... the guys back at the lab are struggling to keep up with the work, you know?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Khayyam:** I&#39;m well aware.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Marshall:** Alright then. Yeah. Just, uh, call me when he&#39;s gonna come back to work.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Khayyam:** I&#39;ll let you know.

  Found a couple of worrying things from a few patients of yours. Notably, this guy doesn&#39;t seem to understand the correct dosage of diazepam. He&#39;s come in a few days too early, says he&#39;s run out – did you change the dosage? Could you get back to me with regards to whatever&#39;s going on here? _

  _
  Could I ask you when we&#39;ll be expecting Scott back? I understand he needs time to grieve, but we&#39;re currently behind on about six weeks of anomalous item processing and several critical pieces of work with some memetic anomalies we need to close before they can continue to balloon further out of control. He&#39;s one of our primary specialists here at Memetics and his absence is felt heavily every day. _
  _
  Please let me know ASAP when Scott will be available for work again. _

  No, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve told him to change the dose. Thanks for letting me know: this could get really worrying really fast. I&#39;m going to ask the Medical staff to have him transferred to the Medical ward full time, just in case. _

||||~ Message ||
|||| Hey, _
  _
  You told me to get in touch when I could and you were right – I told Jake that you&#39;d asked for me to get the laptop and he practically jumped out of his damn seat to get me one. Thanks for that. _
  _
  First things first: I&#39;m gonna really miss Gracie. She was one of the few vets they had in the barracks here and she was a goddamn great girl, all things considered. Had crazy shop talk, kept on smiling even when we were all about to piss ourselves. A few of the other people here asked me to tell you that they wanted to say thanks for letting them go to the funeral. _
  _
  Second: tell the doctor I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t know Ari, never met the guy myself, but I saw him crying that day. _
  _
  I don&#39;t think anyone would cry that way over someone they didn&#39;t miss that much. _
  _
  I think that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got to say at the moment. I&#39;ll talk to you again next week when the guards let me on the laptop again. ||

  &gt; A few of my colleagues have reported seeing Dr. Fletcher outside of work.

||~ Ticket #: || 1182931230 ||
||~ Severity: || High ||
||~ Issuer: || Security Officer Malcolm Wethers ||
||||~ Complaint ||
|||| Site-43&#39;s temporary email account appears to have been disabled by Level 4 Command, despite no known order to disable the account being issued. ||
||||~ Response ||
|||| Hi Malcolm, _
  _
  Seems like the account got forcibly closed just yesterday under suspicion of memetic contamination, which is probably why you didn&#39;t get told about it. Have you checked the LASHLEY infohazard scans to see if there&#39;s any leftover memetic bugs in the email&#39;s inbox? There&#39;s a one in a million chance that it won&#39;t send an alert to the tech staff, though we&#39;re working on eradicating that bug once and for all. If it does turn out you fell victim to that particular glitch, I&#39;d say you&#39;d be best off going through the logs yourself. _
  _
  Alternately, you could file a Mishandled Shutdown Form (available ##red|here##) to try and reactivate the account. Failing that, you&#39;re just going to have to wait for another few weeks while we get the email all cleaned out. ||

  The man&#39;s been asking to prescribe pretty goddamn strong amnestics to Scott under suspicion of a &#34;memetic infection&#34;, and the only way I could get him off my goddamn back was by telling him he could come to the group therapy session next week if he didn&#39;t believe me. _
  _
  Could you send the attached security video to the Ethics Committee? Let&#39;s just say I have a strong feeling that if they get wind of this development they&#39;re not going to like Sam very much. _

As per standard disciplinary escalation, further disruptive behaviour should result in a revocation of such privileges. ||
