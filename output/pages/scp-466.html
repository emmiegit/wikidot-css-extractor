----

**Item #:** SCP-466
 
**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-466 is locked in a 5 meter by 5 meter by 5 meter room. SCP-466 is to be fed five times a day through a one-way slot in the steel door, with low-iron meals of mass below 0.1 kg. The key to the door is accessible only to Level 3 or higher personnel.

**Description:** It is unknown if SCP-466 is a separate pathogen affecting a human host, or the human host itself. Current theory suggests the former. For clarity, the host individual will be referred to as SCP-466-2 and the possible infective agent as SCP-466-1.

SCP-466-2 is a [REDACTED]. SCP-466-2 exhibits anomalous vascular hypertrophy, particularly along the skin. This includes very broad arteries and veins not part of normal human anatomy. The continually-increasing mass of blood vessels is gradually displacing and eroding SCP-466-2&#39;s muscles and organs. SCP-466-2 is estimated to have approximately █ liters of blood.

The excess vessels will sometimes rearrange under the skin, which is extremely painful. If the host or hypothesized pathogen is threatened, the excess vessels will physically tear the skin and extend up to █ meters outward. These defense vessels will constrict threats until neutralized. If cut, they hemorrhage as expected, and will be replaced by more vessels from deeper inside SCP-466-2&#39;s body.

As demonstrated by the rearrangements, SCP-466-1 displays some degree of control over the mobile vessels when inside the body. This control is utilized when SCP-466-2 consumes food: if SCP-466-2 does not consume the entire meal, SCP-466-1 will use the collective strength of the mobile vessels and force-feed SCP-466-2. This is advantageous for SCP-466-1; it appears that nutrients go primarily to expansion of the mobile vessels.

&gt; 
&gt; **Details:** SCP-466 and patient had begun to show abnormal behavior as extremities, excluding the head, began suffering from avascular necrosis over a 48 hour period.   Afterwards, SCP-466 was observed to go into a state of acute cardiac arrest.  Level-3 authorization was granted for a rapid response medical team to assist in the revival of the patient while observing the standard protocols of extrinsic biological hazards.  SCP-466 and patient were pronounced dead after thirty minutes of continuous resuscitation.   SCP-466 and patient were left in the containment cell for another 48 hours of observation with no activity reported.  
&gt; 
&gt; Level-3 authorization was then given to perform an autopsy on the deceased body.  Upon opening the chest cavity, it was observed by medical staff that all arteries and veins had retracted from the external limbs and were clustered around the heart.  Though the body was in a normal state of expected decay, the cardiovascular system seemed to show no signs of decomposition.  During the autopsy, SCP-466 and the patient became active again and killed the two closest medical staff, Doctors Girard and Sharma.  
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-466 was observed appropriating the circulatory systems from the deceased into itself while also attempting to sever the head of the patient with a surgical bone saw.  The patient&#39;s head was seen [REDACTED], which prompted Dr. Briggs to attempt a rescue of the patient from SCP-466.  Dr. Briggs was subsequently killed; however, the distraction was timely enough to allow security teams to arrive on scene before the decapitation could take place.  SCP-466 was eventually contained and the patient secured.  Three medical and security staff were treated with minor injuries, two fractures and three lacerations.  One security officer had to be surgically treated for a punctured lung and heart.   
&gt; 
&gt; **Action Items:** Review procedures regarding SCP-466.  Current procedures may not apply.

&gt; +++ POST-INCIDENT INTERVIEW,,INT-466-12,,
&gt; ----
&gt; **Interview Date:** 08/04/2014
&gt; **Interview Time:** 06:48
&gt; **Site/Location:** Research Site-45
&gt; **Interviewer/s:** Internal Investigator Rubén Foster
&gt; **Interviewee/s:** Medical Director Dr. Andrea Itzkowitz
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Foster:**  All right... we are recording now.  Have a seat, doctor.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Itzkowitz:**  How long will this take?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Foster:**  Depends.  Is this your first time in one of these?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Itzkowitz:**  No.  There was one other time.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Foster:**  Well, let&#39;s get started.  (//papers shuffling//)  You were... according to the case file... the one who authorized the autopsy, correct?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Itzkowitz:**  I did.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Foster:**  Would you like to elaborate a bit more, doctor... for the record.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Itzkowitz:**  Right.  Well, we were certain that it died and we waited for two days as per the protocols for expired anomalous entities in containment.  I ordered the autopsy to be performed before the body decayed any further.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Foster:**  Did you have the body scanned or order an X-ray beforehand? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Itzkowitz:**  We did.  I said we were doing it by the book.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Foster:**  You felt that was enough?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Itzkowitz:**  ...
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Foster:**  Doctor?  Can you please answer?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Itzkowitz:**  ...I didn&#39;t see a need for further counter-measures.  We were dealing with time constraints to perform the autopsy before the incineration deadline.  So no.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Foster:**  (//scribbling//) Then what happened?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Itzkowitz:**  It came back to life... 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Foster:**  You were present?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Itzkowitz:**  I was in the observation booth.  I was the one that called security.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Foster:**  Was there a reason why security wasn&#39;t on standby?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Itzkowitz:**  I told Doctor Sharma to take care of that.  Apparently he didn&#39;t.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Foster:**  Yes. Now Sharma is dead.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Itzkowitz:**  Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Foster:**  (//scribbling//)  Tell me about Doctor Briggs during this incident.  He was the only person present in the room while security was being assembled, correct?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Itzkowitz:**  Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Foster:**  ...Continue.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Itzkowitz:**  Sorry.  I think he was trying to save the patient.  The body was in fairly poor condition and was falling apart while the thing was fighting back.  
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Foster:**  The patient was also alive?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Itzkowitz:**  Yes.  Though it is just a head now, connected to that thing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Foster:**  So what prompted the Doctor to attempt a rescue?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Itzkowitz:**  I&#39;m pretty sure there were words exchanged between them, since the lungs were still attached.  I couldn&#39;t make out the voice behind the glass.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Foster:**  Any idea about what was said?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Itzkowitz:**  No.  But apparently it was enough to convince Briggs to risk his own life and try to stop the thing from sawing the patient off its... body, I guess.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Foster:**  I see.  (//scribbling//)  Then what happened?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Itzkowitz:**  Briggs struggled with it for a few seconds.  Then it... well... I&#39;m not really sure what you call it.  Rooted into him I guess?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Foster:**  And that&#39;s when security came in?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Itzkowitz:**  Right, then I ran after the glass was shot out. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Foster:**  Where is the entity and patient now?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Itzkowitz:**  Heavily sedated in temporary containment until we figure out what to do next.  The head still seems active, however.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Foster:**  That is... rather interesting.  (//scribbling//)  Is there anything else?  Any other details you want on record?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Itzkowitz:**  Briggs was a good man.  I regret his death.  And I&#39;m also going to ensure that his death was not in vain.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Foster:**  Sentiments noted.  Thank you, Doctor.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Itzkowitz:**  So what happens now?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Foster:**  I file this case report to my superiors.  If there is a follow-up, you will be notified.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Itzkowitz:**  Very well.  We&#39;re done then?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Foster:**  Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; (//Dr. Itzkowitz leaves the room and closes the door.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Foster:**  For the record, I don&#39;t believe there was negligence involved here... the procedures were unfortunately outdated.  I&#39;ll see about interviewing the patient if possible.

**Item #:** SCP-466
 
**Object Class:** Euclid (//pending possible reclassification after formal review//)

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-466 is to be sealed in Containment Cell-73 in E-Block at [[[secure-facility-dossier-research-site-45|Research Site-45.]]] E-Block is to remain separated from the main installation for the entirety of SCP-466&#39;s captivity. Containment Cell-73 is to have a 30cm thick acrylic observational window installed and the door welded shut from the outside.  

SCP-466&#39;s primary containment component, or its &#34;head,&#34; and the primary heart connected to the brain stem, are to be locked together in a perforated stainless steel lock box at all times.  [[footnote]] The purpose of placing them together in a lock box is to ensure that collateral is held against SCP-466 as to persuade it to not damage the &#34;head&#34;. [[/footnote]]  The &#34;head&#34; is to be considered a vital component of containment. Efforts must be made to ensure that SCP-466 does not put it in jeopardy and it remains connected at all times.

Four liters of a nutrient-rich water solution is to be sprayed into the containment tank every ten hours.  The nutrient solution will be adjusted and administered by medical staff.  An oxygen-rich atmosphere (25% O,,2,,) will be maintained in the cell at all times.  In the event of a containment breach, SCP-466 is to be suppressed with gas-based flame weaponry.  

**Description:** SCP-466 is an amorphous and animate configuration of four human cardiovascular systems.  The primary heart of SCP-466 is still attached to the original brain stem and thus still preserves its &#34;head&#34;.  The other three were absorbed during a separate incident post-acquisition and serve no purpose other than additional extensions of the whole.  All four hearts of SCP-466 have increased in size by 275% and are observed to beat in synchronization at 130BPM.  SCP-466 is considered to be sentient, as it responds to stimuli and pain in appropriate manners.

The veins and arteries of SCP-466 are able to move, as their smooth muscle tissue (the tissue between the intima and adventitia) has developed into tissue resembling skeletal muscle.  The ends of each appendage is also tipped with a sharp, calcified barb.  SCP-466 is observed to be dexterous and extremely mobile, and can even remain on vertical surfaces or ceilings for long periods of time. 

SCP-466 is capable of producing erythrocytes, monocytes and thrombocytes. It is unknown where the hematopoetic progenitor cells are located, as no bone marrow has been discovered.  SCP-466 is not capable of angiogenesis and is dependent on appropriating other human cardiovascular systems in order to increase its mass.  SCP-466 can, however, heal itself at an accelerated rate.  SCP-466 is able to oxygenate without the use of lungs.  It is theorized to extract oxygen and nutrients from the surrounding air.    

The primary heart still remains connected to the original brain stem, though it has attempted several times to physically separate itself from it, including hitting it against hard surfaces or attempting to rip it off.  The behavior of this is not fully understood, but it is theorized that separating the &#34;head&#34; from SCP-466 would trigger another step in its ongoing development.  SCP-466 has remained in an agitated state since the development of the perforated lock box placed around its &#34;head&#34; and primary heart.  Small amounts of water have been observed to drain from the perforated lock box, though this is merely from condensation and should be ignored.

Due phenotypical similarities to [[[SCP-1429|SCP-1429-005]]], genetic material was compared between the two specimens and found to have multiple orthologous sequences, possibly indicating common ancestry.

[[tab Memorandum-466-72]]

&gt; +++ Memorandum,,M-466-72,,
&gt; Sent: 08/12/2014  21:36
&gt; To: Dr. Frederick Carlyle, Superintendent of Research Site-45
&gt; From: Ethics Committee Review Board Secretary
&gt; ----
&gt; In light of the situation regarding SCP-466, whereas the current containment procedures no longer apply to its current condition and thereby necessitate the review and development of more applicable procedures and containment protocols, the following draft has been proposed.  However, the patient associated with SCP-466 does invoke the authority of the Ethics Committee, as dealing with the well-being and moral decision of what is to be done in regards to both patient and entity.  
&gt; 
&gt; It is unfortunate that there is no ideal solution in separating both, and that there is no sustainable solution in both preserving or improving the quality of life of the patient without putting a substantial amount of risk on additional staff.  It is not an easy decision and would not be the first nor last time such a ruling is made.  Thus, after careful deliberation, this committee is tasked with making those difficult decisions on behalf of the Foundation and has decided the following measures:
&gt; 
&gt; **1. That the patient be considered as lost collateral.  Mental health considerations need not apply.**
&gt; 
&gt; **2. That this lost collateral is considered a deterrent to SCP-466&#39;s development and hence be considered a primary component in aiding containment.**
&gt; 
&gt; **3. That said primary component be maintained and kept in a reasonable functioning state.**
&gt; 
&gt; **4. That all identity and details regarding the primary component be expunged from all records.**
&gt; 
&gt; **5. That staff who are tasked with handling SCP-466 be screened for specific moral objections that may conflict with containment protocols.**
&gt; 
&gt; With these measures in place, the ethics committee review board grants a conditional approval to the following procedures and that they may be enacted immediately as such.  If you have further questions or concerns, please contact us.
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt; Ethics Committee Review Board Secretary
