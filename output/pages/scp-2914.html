**Item #:** SCP-2914

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Only personnel who submit a formal request and receive approval from site command may operate SCP-2914.  SCP-2914 is to be stored in locker 2109-B when not in use.

**Description:** SCP-2914 is a glass-fronted wooden cabinet, 66 cm in height and 38 cm in width, composed of unremarkable materials.  The cabinet contains three glass shelves.  The back of the interior of the cabinet is a mirrored surface.  

The cabinet contains twenty-two stoppered glass bottles, each with a capacity of approximately 0.1 liters.  Under normal, non-testing conditions these bottles are empty.

SCP-2914&#39;s --primary-- anomalous attribute manifests when a human subject physically touches the glass front of SCP-2914 while specifically recalling a particular memory.  Under those circumstances, the glass front momentarily becomes opaque, then transparent again to reveal that some or all of the bottles within the cabinet have been filled with various substances.

Partial test log of SCP-2914 (deconstruction configuration) follows:

**Test reference:** 0001
**Subject:** D-2914, Notably has severe retrograde amnesia
**Description of Test:**  Subject was instructed to touch SCP-2914. Due to communication barriers a specific memory could not be selected
**Result:**  Bottles were filled with the following substances/materials:
# A single bottle with a single smaller bottle which also contained a smaller bottle. This pattern reaches 53 consecutive bottles before ending in a glass cylinder that has no open space.
------

**Addendum #1**
After debriefing D-4962 following the test of SCP-2914, Dr. Morrison inspected SCP-2914 to document the contents of the bottles.  In the course of doing so, Dr. Morrison briefly touched the glass front of the cabinet before the bottles had been removed or disturbed.  Dr. Morrison reported that he experienced a first-person hallucination which corresponded to the details of D-4962&#39;s recollection.
------
**Addendum #2**
Researcher Marcinkiewicz attempted to replicate Dr. Morrison&#39;s experience by causing D-5452 (a 52-year old woman) to touch the glass front of the cabinet about an hour after Test 0023 involving D-4962.  By this time, the ice in bottle #5 had melted, and portions of the samples in other bottles had been removed for testing.  D-5452 reported experiencing a first-person hallucination that involved a bumpy ride for several hours inside a BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicle, following which the point of view exited the vehicle and marched with other Russian soldiers into a barracks.  Extensive interviewing of D-5452 regarding the details of the scenery and setting of the barracks indicated that it was located in northern France.  There are no historical reports of Russian military forces operating a BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicle or maintaining a military presence in that region.

The experience prompted Dr. Morrison and Researcher Marcinkiewicz to commence a separate series of tests.  

Partial testing log of SCP-2914 in its antideconstruction configuration follows:

------
**Test reference:** 0166
**Subject:** D-7871
**Description of Test:**  Researcher Marcinkiewicz filled bottles as follows:
# Soil (obtained from Central Park, New York City)
# Grass clippings (obtained from Central Park, New York City)
# Water (New York City tap water)
# Rolled-up newspaper clipping advertising a &#34;Shakespeare in the Park&#34; event
# Cigarette
**Result:** Subject had never visited New York City.  Subject reported experiencing a hallucination of a visit to Central Park.  Subject&#39;s description of some park landmarks differed from their real-world counterparts.
------
**Test reference:** 0182
**Subject:** D-8386
**Description of Test:**  Researcher Marcinkiewicz filled bottles as follows:
# Sample of D-8386&#39;s blood
# Air, with concentrations of oxygen and sulfur dioxide
# Seawater
# Limestone
# Fern frond
# Crushed, powdered coal
**Result:** Subject reported hallucination of standing on the shores of a sea while several large animals (presumably hadrosaurs, based on the description given) grazed nearby.

------
**Test reference:** 0184
**Subject:** D-8392
**Description of Test:**  Researcher Marcinkiewicz filled bottles as follows:
# Seawater
# Sand
# Blood of //Crocodylus porosus// (saltwater crocodile)
# Fish viscera
**Result:** After recovering from severe nausea, subject reported experiencing the sensation of being a female //Crocodylus porosus// during the act of mating.
------
**Test reference:** 0188
**Subject:** D-7884
**Description of Test:**  Researcher Marcinkiewicz filled bottles as follows:
# Distilled water
# Liquified, heated polyurethane
# Iron filings
**Result:** Subject blacked out for approximately 35 minutes.  When subject recovered, subject reported having experienced the sensation of asphyxiating in outer space.  After extensive interviews conducted with the use of hypnosis and nootropic tropic medications, subject was able to describe the environment that she had observed during her experience, which consisted of the interior of an orbital space station operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation, the hull of which had been damaged exposing the interior to the vacuum of space.  The Indian Space Research Organisation has not, to date, ever launched a space station.  Subject experienced acute PTSD and has been deemed unsuitable for future testing.

------
**Test reference:** 2932
**Subject:** D-11328
**Description of Test:**  Dr. Morrison filled bottles as follows:
# Sample of D-11328&#39;s blood
# Sample of blood of D-0936 (a D-class personnel stationed at a different facility who had never encountered D-11328)
# Grass clippings from several widely separated sources
# Soil samples from several widely separated sources
# Wine (blend of two different vintages not normally available for purchase at the same place)
# Strips of musculature of several different animals
# Metal filings (obtained from sampling various historical artifacts including a Roman-era iron architectural component, a bronze Tang-dynasty Chinese bell, and an iron spearhead from southern Africa)
**Result:** Subject blacked out for several hours.  Upon recovery, subject was confused and distressed and had lost the ability to communicate in English.  Over the course of a series of interviews conducted over a period of weeks with the liberal use of nootropic medicines, researchers learned that subject was able to communicate in an archaic form of the Telugu language.  Subject, although female, identified as a male and reported that &#34;he&#34; had lived for at least thirty years as a traveling merchant, transporting merchandise overland from the region of Khorasan (central Asia) to the city of Amadomoglu (which does not appear on historical records but according to D-11328&#39;s account, was located on the east bank of the Volga River near the northern Caspian Sea.  Most of the details of D-11328&#39;s report do not correspond to identifiable  historical places or events, but the report included an account matching the description of SN 1054 (a supernova in the constellation Taurus that occurred in the year 1054 AD).  Subject&#39;s last chronological recollection was of a &#34;Daeva attack&#34;, after which subject could not recall any subsequent events.  Subject had no recollection of her life before the test.

------
**Test reference:** 2937
**Subject:** D-114078
**Description of Test:**  Dr. Morrison filled bottles as follows:
# Coffee from Site 22 break room
# Fresh water
# **[DATA EXPUNGED]**
# **[DATA EXPUNGED]**
# **[DATA EXPUNGED]**
# **[DATA EXPUNGED]**
**Result:** Subject reported hallucination of unremarkable events in Site 22&#39;s D-class secured dormitory.  Four days after test, D-114078 escaped from secured dormitory, apparently by means of successfully impersonating Dr. Morrison and obtaining unauthorized access to Site 22&#39;s data files and security center.  Dr. Morrison was killed during the escape.  D-114078&#39;s whereabouts are unknown.
