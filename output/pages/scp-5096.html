**Item #:** SCP-5096

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5096 is to be stored in a modified Class-7 Biological Containment Cell within Site-08. This cell is to have all life support equipment[[footnote]] E.g. automatic feeding units and climate control systems. [[/footnote]] removed and retrofitted with a 5-meter-tall concrete pedestal for SCP-5096 to rest upon.

SCP-5096 is to be kept at least 3 meters from all soil and other forms of particulate silicate matter and is to be kept at least 50 meters from living organisms belonging to the phylum Annelida[[footnote]]Ringworms and Segmented worms.[[/footnote]]and the phylum Arthropoda.[[footnote]]Insects, crustaceans, arachnids, centipedes, and scorpions.[[/footnote]]

Two weeks following a GARDEN-PARTY event, SCP-5096’s cell is to be cleaned of the remains of all SCP-5096-2 instances present. SCP-5096-2 instances displaying properties previously undocumented will be retained for further study; all other instances are to be brought to a standard Biological Containment cell for storage.

**Description:** SCP-5096 refers to a singular painted lady butterfly (//Vanessa cardui Rhopalocera//). SCP-5096 can manifest an entomology book titled //&#39;Life of Insects: The Study and Story Behind Entomology&#39;// by Jane Woodsburrow (designated SCP-5096-1). SCP-5096 is capable of turning the pages of SCP-5096-1 via the flapping of its wings. When SCP-5096-1 is opened, the environment depicted on the chosen page will manifest. (Ex: A page about the average earthworm will result in the manifestation of soil and grass.)

If SCP-5096 is introduced to soil or other forms of particulate silicate matter, SCP-5096 will produce a number of duplicates of itself (designated SCP-5096-2). When introduced to any organism belonging to the phylum Annelida or the phylum Arthropoda, the entire vicinity around SCP-5096 will transform into that of outdoor scenery (though will remain indoors), and instances of SCP-5096-2 will metamorphosize into organisms belonging to the phylum Annelida or the phylum Arthropoda (designated GARDEN-PARTY event). The effects of a GARDEN-PARTY event will persist even if the organisms introduced to SCP-5096 are removed. A GARDEN-PARTY event will last for approximately two weeks before SCP-5096-2 instances are able to be removed. It is of note that this event does not occur if SCP-5096 interacts with soil that manifests along with the environments depicted in SCP-5096-1.


**Addendum-1: SCP-5096-1 Excerpts** 



[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Page Number:** 23

**Page Contents:**  The habitat and behavior of the American Cockroach (//periplaneta americana//).

**Effect:** A small portion of SCP-5096&#39;s cell transforms to wet cement and stone resembling a house garage. Half-eaten food items are scattered across the pavement, as well as nine cockroaches scavenging said food. SCP-5096 flutters over to each cockroach, aiding each one in the retrieval of a food item. SCP-5096 stays in the affected area until SCP-5096-1 is closed.

**Additional Notes:** Handwritten notes in the margin of page 29 reading: //&#39;A lot of people hate cockroaches, but I just love these little guys. I try to help them get food whenever I can. And they only want shelter from the rain! Why would you squish the poor creatures? Bugs are more like us than you&#39;d think, I know you don&#39;t like being hungry in the rain.&#39;//

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Page Number:** 40

**Page Contents:** The behaviors of the Average Honey Bee (//Apis mellifera//).

**Effect:** A large tree trunk with a honey bee hive located within a large central hollow manifests along with several rocks and a small grassy area. SCP-5096 flutters around the hive, but remains carefully outside of the bees&#39; detection for approximately two minutes before SCP-5096-1 is closed. 

**Additional Notes:** Handwritten notes in the margin of page 40 reading: //&#39;I like bees. Bees are calm. I like calm. Many think bees are dangerous, but they don&#39;t want to hurt you. They want to help you! They want your garden to be the best it can be! I guess I&#39;m like them in that way. I spend lots of time in my garden watching them. You should let bees help.&#39;// 

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Page Number:** 67

**Page Contents:** The habitat, behaviors, and background of the Drugstore Beetle (//Stegobium paniceum//).

**Effect:** A small section of SCP-5096&#39;s cell transforms into dry tile with a large open bag of dry dog food. Several dozen drugstore beetles can be seen within, scavenging the food. SCP-5096 flutters above the affected area, then flies away from it.

**Additional Notes:** Handwritten notes in the margin of page 67 reading: &#39;//Man, those drugstore beetles are quite the thing aren&#39;t they? There&#39;s a whole lot of them. You know the name comes from the fact that they like to feed upon pharmacological products such as dried herbs and plants. Haha, that&#39;s pretty cool! Most people think they&#39;re a nuisance, but I think they&#39;re just like us. I&#39;ve been eating more outdoor things recently, but that&#39;s fine! Gives me more time to observe and document for this book.&#39;//

[[/div]]




[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Page Number:** 115

**Page Contents:** The habitat, behaviors, and information about the painted lady butterfly (//Vanessa cardui Rhopalocera//).

**Effect:** All of SCP-5096&#39;s cell transforms to mimic that of a backyard-like area typically found in temperate climates, including trees, a patio-style porch against the wall with a door, grass, flowers, and daytime sky. No other insects manifest. SCP-5096 flutters around the entirety of its cell for approximately five minutes before landing on a stack of papers lying in the grass. The effects of SCP-5096-1 demanifest approximately seven minutes after it is closed.

**Additional Notes:** Handwritten notes in the margin of page 115 reading: //&#39;You guys get to see a bit of where I grew up, ey? Technically I&#39;m just talking about butterflies here, but I mean I guess I connect to that now. It&#39;s a wonder I&#39;ve still been able to write in here. But how will I share this? There are a million books about insects out there, but you&#39;ll never find someone more passionate about it than me. I&#39;ll still spread the message, I&#39;ll get there somehow.&#39;// 

[[/div]]

**Addendum-2:** Approximately two months after the discovery of SCP-5096, the home of Jane Woodsburrow was found vacated, and is believed to be associated with SCP-5096. Within the home, an indoor butterfly enclosure with multiple butterflies inside was found. Next to this was a collection of notes.
