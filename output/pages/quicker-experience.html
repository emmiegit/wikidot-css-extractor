&gt; **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-████ is contained in a Low-Value Object Locker at Site-55.
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** SCP-████ is the designation for a topical skincare product, branded by its packaging as &#34;//Level+//&#34;. SCP-████ is similar in appearance and consistency to a normal moisturizing hand cream.
&gt; 
&gt; The anomalous properties of SCP-████ become apparent with routine applications over time. Those using the product demonstrate a subtly improved capacity for learning. This applies to absorption and retention of academic material, as well as practical skills. 
&gt; 
&gt; Tests were conducted which measured subjects&#39; initial ability and subsequent progress in different fields, such as: reading comprehension, mental arithmetic, and playing guitar. In all cases, subjects using SCP-████ demonstrated an accelerated rate of proficiency.

&#34;Is this stuff for real?&#34; Junior Researcher McKinney burst into the room with a printout in hand.

Junior Researcher Lee glanced up from his computer monitor, a little annoyed at the sudden interruption. He looked at the sheet his colleague was waving around and confirmed &#34;Yes. I&#39;m in the middle of updating the file right now, actually.&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s amazing! Where did it come from?&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s what I&#39;m working on. You know how we&#39;ve been cataloguing all that stuff from the, uh...&#34; Lee forgot the particular Item # himself in the moment, and fumbled to describe it: &#34;The weird alternate dimension where everything is like from some kinda RPG video game; you know what I mean.&#34;

&#34;Yeah yeah. So some D-Class was able to bring this back from an exploration test, huh? It must have been difficult.&#34;

&#34;According to the subject&#39;s account, an NPC basically just gave it away to them. Like, as a reward for a very trivial quest or something.&#34;

&#34;But this stuff is incredibly useful! Why would it be so easy to get?&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s what I&#39;m in the middle of figuring out! Apparently the test subjects only have a limited time before they have to be pulled back out, so they tend to skip most of the dialogue screens.&#34;

&#34;Probably missing out on lots of content that way,&#34; McKinney sighed and shook his head.

&#34;When they get around to letting test subjects roleplay as a wizard gnome with a deep backstory and character motivations that they invent for themselves, shall they give you a call?&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s-! I&#39;m not even-! I wouldn&#39;t be a wiz-!&#34; McKinney spluttered, finally collecting himself enough to deliver an emphatic &#34;No.&#34;

&#34;Anyway, I&#39;m re-reading the speech text now, so I can get these Addendums submitted.&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s &#39;Addenda&#39;,&#34; the pedantic McKinney corrected Lee. &#34;So what does it say; is there an explanation?&#34;

&#34;I was almost at the end before you interrupted me.&#34;

McKinney leaned in and read over Lee&#39;s shoulder.

Thank you, DICKHEA! Now I have the materials I need.

-----
| MERCHANT GERALD

I&#39;d Like to give you something, as a token of my gratitude.

-----

//5 Level+(s) added to Inventory.//

-----
| MERCHANT GERALD

These will grant a bonus to all your SKILL increases for a time. That should be useful for an adventurer like yourself.

-----
| MERCHANT GERALD

After all, they&#39;re only gathering dust here on my shelves...

-----
| MERCHANT GERALD

I&#39;ve done everything I can to sell them, but nobody else in the village is willing to even give them a try.

-----
| MERCHANT GERALD

I guess there&#39;s really no helping it... Cool guys don&#39;t look at EXP Lotions.
