**Item #:** SCP-5552

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The CHRONUS Project is to continue research to confirm the details of SCP-5552. While it is possible that SCP-5552 related phenomena can be explained given our current understanding of science, they have been deemed anomalous until further progress has been made. 

**Description:** SCP-5552 refers to a theoretical method of travel between parallel universes with similar cause-and-effect chains. Details regarding the exact nature of SCP-5552, as well as the parallel universes it can access, are under investigation by the CHRONUS Project, lead by Dr. Naman Gupta and Dr. Cindy Helsman. 

**Addendum SCP-5552-1:** Below is the transcript of the meeting on 2018/07/04 between Dr. Helsman and Dr. Gupta, first proposing the existence of SCP-5552.

&gt; //Dr. Gupta paces back and forth in front of his desk. Dr. Helsman enters Dr. Gupta&#39;s office, at which point Dr. Gupta checks his pocketwatch.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Gupta:** You&#39;re late.
&gt; 
&gt; **Helsman:** Only by a minute.
&gt; 
&gt; **Gupta:** You&#39;re still late.
&gt; 
&gt; **Helsman:** Naman, are you ok? You seem a little more restless than normal.
&gt; 
&gt; //Gupta takes three deep breaths, and then sits down at his desk.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Gupta:** Sorry. I&#39;m just anxious. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Helsman:** Anxious about what? Paper deadline?
&gt; 
&gt; **Gupta:** No, no...
&gt; 
&gt; **Helsman:** Then what is it? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Gupta:** Ok. Cindy, I am about to say something that sounds incredibly stupid. But I am going to need you to believe me, alright?
&gt; 
&gt; **Helsman:** Ok...
&gt; 
&gt; **Gupta:** I might be from the future. 
&gt; 
&gt; //Helsman remains silent, before beginning to say something. However, she stops herself.//
&gt;  
&gt; **Gupta:** Yeah...
&gt; 
&gt; **Helsman:** ... but what does that mean?
&gt; 
&gt; **Gupta:** So, I think it&#39;s like this. I know for certain that I came from somewhere that on April 16th, 2020, you die and I take over the CHRONUS Project. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Helsman:** Wait wait. You&#39;re saying I die in two years? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Gupta:** Well, that&#39;s assuming I&#39;m from the future. Because there&#39;s another option: I&#39;m from a parallel universe. And I didn&#39;t travel in time at all.
&gt; 
&gt; **Helsman:** Well, I mean if you&#39;re from a parallel universe then wouldn&#39;t that mean you&#39;ve still travelled back in time? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Gupta:** No no. In this scenario I actually can&#39;t travel backwards in time. It&#39;d be impossible. It&#39;d just be an illusion since each of the universes are temporally offset.
&gt; 
&gt; **Helsman:** I— I don&#39;t follow. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Gupta:** No it&#39;s like... Like time zones. Here it&#39;s three but in California it&#39;s noon. Here it&#39;s April 4th but in another parallel universe it&#39;s March 6th. You can&#39;t travel backwards in time, but you can travel to a parallel universe that started a month later than this one, and that&#39;s almost the same thing. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Helsman:** Ok. And why do you think this is what you&#39;ve been doing instead of time travel? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Gupta:** Well, um... not all parallel universes are created equal. In fact a lot of them are probably unstable. So at certain points in time, arbitrary groups of particles will just, like they&#39;ll lose stability. Err, but not entirely. Like they go black, and they crumble and it&#39;s... it&#39;s like the very fabric of reality just wilts away. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Helsman:** You know you sound crazy right?
&gt; 
&gt; **Gupta:** Yes but haven&#39;t I always sounded insane? Most of what I say sounds absurd, yet you still run the numbers for me. Because we both know I might be right.
&gt; 
&gt; **Helsman:** ... do you want me to start making models?
&gt; 
&gt; **Gupta:** That would be fantastic. 

**Addendum SCP-5552-2:** Two weeks following this proposal, Site-72 personnel reported concerns about Dr. Gupta&#39;s mental well-being. Dr. Gupta was only seen leaving his office to go to the bathroom, and to get food from the cafeteria which he would then eat in his office. Dr. Green, occupying a neighboring office, reported hearing Dr. Gupta shout the phrase &#34;It doesn&#39;t make sense&#34;, and other variants with similar meaning. Dr. Helsman was requested to speak with Dr. Gupta, as he has refused meetings with other personnel. 

&gt; //Gupta is looking at the whiteboard in his office. It is filled with a flow chart. Helsman knocks on the door to Gupta&#39;s office.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Gupta:** //[shouts]// I&#39;m busy.
&gt; 
&gt; **Helsman:** Even for me? 
&gt; 
&gt; //Gupta opens the door slightly. After seeing Helsman, he opens it the rest of the way. Helsman enters.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Gupta:** Sorry. I&#39;m just stressed still. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Helsman:** You seem a little more than stressed. People are worried about you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Gupta:** I know, I know. I&#39;m fine. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Helsman:** You know, you used to get lunch with everyone else. Might be good to get your mind off of work.
&gt; 
&gt; **Gupta:** I can&#39;t. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Helsman:** Because...
&gt; 
&gt; **Gupta:** It&#39;s just... there&#39;s so much I still can&#39;t explain. Like how I&#39;ve only travelled to similar parallel universes. Why haven&#39;t I blasted myself off to a world where Earth doesn&#39;t even exist! 
&gt;  
&gt; **Helsman:** Well, I have some news. Not sure if it&#39;ll help or not...
&gt; 
&gt; **Gupta:** I&#39;m listening either way.
&gt; 
&gt; **Helsman:** I haven&#39;t been able to get your parallel universe theory to work. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Gupta:** Oh.
&gt; 
&gt; **Helsman:** Yeah. Mostly the stability part. What you&#39;re describing just doesn&#39;t fit with... anything really. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Gupta:** I see.
&gt; 
&gt; **Helsman:** I mean, we&#39;ll come up with another theory. It sounds like we&#39;ve been able to explain everything so far. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Gupta:** Yeah. Yeah you&#39;re right. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Helsman:** Take a few days off. You said I die in two years right? We still have time. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Gupta:** Yeah... I&#39;ll do that. 

Dr. Gupta was approved for a vacation between 2018/07/19 and 2018/07/26. 

**Addendum SCP-5552-3:** On 2018/07/24, Site-72 experienced a mass alteration to its molecular structure, as well as the molecular structure of all personnel and materials within. This alteration resulted in all affected materials taking on a charcoal-like structure that collapses into a liquid state when disturbed. 

Dr. Gupta ended his vacation early, taking over the CHRONUS Project and moving it to Site-53.
