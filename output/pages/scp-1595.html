**Item #:** SCP-1595

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation agents embedded in archaeological services, media outlets and intelligence agencies are to identify and isolate possible instances of SCP-1595 in order to limit public exposure to them, with an emphasis on professionals who might identify the historical discrepancies inherent to SCP-1595. Portable instances of SCP-1595 are to be transferred into Foundation custody, while stationary instances are to be documented and deleted. Use of Class-C amnestics is authorized when necessary.    

**Description:** SCP-1595 is a series of numbered messages originating from various time periods and locations. SCP-1595&#39;s anomalous properties stem from their anachronistic nature; instances of SCP-1595 will often be written using methods which should not be available in the time period or location from which they originate, and are always in modern English. SCP-1595 messages are internally serialized, and each instance discovered will follow the one found before it, despite sometimes being written centuries earlier.

Additionally, analysis of the handwriting used in SCP-1595 messages indicates that they have been composed by the same person, regardless of the aforementioned chronological discrepancies. Of the sixty-seven messages found so far, fifty-three have been addressed to the same person, an unknown woman named &#34;Molly&#34;. Of the remaining messages, three address a &#34;Danny&#34;, two address a &#34;Ben&#34;, four have an unknown addressee, and five are mostly illegible.  

**Addendum SCP-1595-A:** The following is a list of notable instances of SCP-1595:

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Show Log&#34; hide=&#34;- Hide&#34;]]

&gt; SCP-1595-1
&gt; 
&gt; **Origin:** Chiseled on the inside of the ██████ family mausoleum, London. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Approximate date of writing:** 1700&#39;s 
&gt; 
&gt; **Recovered:** 1920
&gt; 
&gt; **Message:** I know you&#39;re out there somewhere, Molly. Come back, it doesn&#39;t have to end this way. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** The ██████ mausoleum was sealed after the death of the last of the family. 

&gt; SCP-1595-3
&gt; 
&gt; **Origin:** Written in permanent marker on a copy of a Gutenberg Bible, recovered from the Papal Archives. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Approximate date of writing:** 1453
&gt; 
&gt; **Recovered:** 1932
&gt; 
&gt; **Message:** You have to let me see them, Molly! They&#39;re my kids too, you bitch! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** The permanent marker was invented in 1952. 

&gt; SCP-1595-7
&gt; 
&gt; **Origin:** Inscribed with a ballpoint pen on the margins of █████ █████&#39;s //Madonna in White//
&gt; 
&gt; **Approximate date of writing:** 1670-1690 
&gt; 
&gt; **Recovered:** 1945
&gt; 
&gt; **Message:** Oh, you&#39;re a fast one, I&#39;ll give you that. I never could catch up to you. But you&#39;re traveling heavy, doll.  

&gt; SCP-1595-9
&gt; 
&gt; **Origin:** Inscribed on the walls of a cave in the ████ mountain range. Originally recovered by the ████████ expedition.  
&gt; 
&gt; **Approximate date of writing:** 14,000-12,000 BCE
&gt; 
&gt; **Recovered:** 1948
&gt; 
&gt; **Message:** You&#39;re leaving a trail. You can&#39;t hide forever, Molly. I know forever like the back of my hand. 
&gt; 
&gt;  **Note:** This message is unique in that it was not written manually. Instead a type of laser cutter was used. 
 
&gt; SCP-1595-14
&gt;   
&gt; **Origin:** On a blank sheet of paper found in the belongings of ████ ██████ after her death.  
&gt;   
&gt; **Approximate date of writing:** 1830
&gt;   
&gt; **Recovered:** 1956
&gt;   
&gt; **Message:** I&#39;m leaving this for you, Danny. I know your mother might not like it, but we&#39;ll keep it as our little secret. You always loved watching me work in the garage. 
&gt;   
&gt; **Note:** ████ ██████&#39;s death was determined to be a homicide, but the murder weapon was not identified. Contemporary forensic techniques reveal it to be an electric steel saw.

&gt;   
&gt; **Approximate date of writing:** 650-670 
&gt;  
&gt; **Recovered:** 1967
&gt;    
&gt; **Message:** It&#39;s a good thing I keep those things numbered. God damn, but this temporal bullshit can get confusing. 
 

&gt; SCP-1595-34
&gt;   
&gt; **Origin:** A footnote on a bill published by the Parliament of Flanders.
&gt;    
&gt; **Approximate date of writing:** 1686
&gt;  
&gt; **Recovered:** 1978
&gt;   
&gt; **Message:** Someone&#39;s helping you, Molly, I know it. That&#39;s against the rules, doll, you know that. You&#39;ll have to be punished.  
&gt; 

&gt; SCP-1595-48
&gt;   
&gt; **Origin:** On the enlistment papers of █████ ██████ to the British army, recovered from the Imperial War Museum.  
&gt;   
&gt; **Approximate date of writing:** 1912 
&gt;  
&gt; **Recovered:** 1986
&gt;    
&gt; **Message:** You went to them? Them, of all people? That takes guts, I&#39;ll give you that. It won&#39;t be enough though, not even where you are. Or rather, when you are. They can&#39;t protect you, not ever. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** Enlistment papers also contained an African Elephant World Wildlife Fund 1st Stamp, dating to 2011. 

&gt; SCP-1595-51
&gt; 
&gt; **Origin:** Etched on a copper plate found in an unmarked tomb, Siberia. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Approximate date of writing:** 5,000-4,500 BCE
&gt; 
&gt; **Recovered:** 1990
&gt; 
&gt; **Message:** Can you hear the ticking, Molly? I hear it all the time, nowadays. It was irritating, at first, but I got used to it. You&#39;d be surprised, the things you can get used to if you have to. Like the cage they must have put you and the kids in. How could you do that to them? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** In addition to the body, the tomb contained three hundred (300) ivory beads, one hundred and fifty (150) fox teeth, and the remains of a .38 Smith &amp; Wesson Special. A bullet belonging to the same firearm was found embedded in the skeleton&#39;s femur.

&gt; 
&gt;

&gt; SCP-1595-65
&gt;   
&gt; **Origin:** Found on a stone wall in the archaeological site of Gobekli Tepe, Turkey. 
&gt;    
&gt; **Approximate date of writing:** 11,000-10,000 BCE
