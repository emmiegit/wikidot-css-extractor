&gt; ++++ NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION DEPARTMENT OF MISCOMMUNICATIONS
&gt; 
&gt; Analysis of this file has confirmed it displays no unusual properties. All information present in it can be taken as a literal statement of fact.

**Item #:** SCP-5034

**Object Class:** Tiamat

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to budgetary concerns[[footnote]] See Containment Attempt 5034-17 for more details. [[/footnote]], it has been determined that containment of SCP-5034 is not currently possible. When SCP-5034 is discovered in an antique store[[footnote]] Criteria for likely attack sites is currently undetermined. [[/footnote]], Agents are to immediately proceed to said store and begin experimentation.

Use of standard testing equipment is authorized in regards to SCP-5034. All tests must be approved by the Foundation Experimentation Committee[[footnote]] Formed following initial commencement of hostilities on 15/09/2020. [[/footnote]].

**Description:** SCP-5034 is the collective term for a china bowl[[footnote]] Although this planet-wide range has been confirmed, it is currently unknown whether it extends beyond that. [[/footnote]] containing seven red marbles[[footnote]] Individual appearances variable. Refer to sighting logs for a full description of SCP-5034 appearances. [[/footnote]].

At all times, SCP-5034 will consist of the china bowl and the seven red marbles within it. If a marble is destroyed or removed from SCP-5034, it will disappear and a new one will reappear inside the bowl. Attempts to contain marbles outside of SCP-5034[[footnote]] Use of the prototype Adaptive Containment Chamber (ACC) was approved for this purpose. [[/footnote]] have similarly failed. All attempts to interfere with these marbles have had an extremely negative impact on the Foundation&#39;s budget[[footnote]] Full casualty reports are not yet available due to lack of up-to-date information. [[/footnote]].

SCP-5034 exhibits a secondary anomalous effect. All individuals who observe SCP-5034 will be aware that it is a china bowl containing seven red marbles, even if they lack prior context[[footnote]] Attempts to directly breach metaphysical camouflage have thus far been unsuccessful. [[/footnote]]. However, this awareness does not appear to directly impact information one step removed from SCP-5034. For example, an individual observing SCP-5034 will be aware it is a china bowl, but an individual observing evidence left behind by SCP-5034 will not[[footnote]] For full information on asynchronous war planning, consult the Foundation War Committee. [[/footnote]].

**Addendum 5034-1 (Experimentation Log):**

The following is a log of all experiments conducted with SCP-5034[[footnote]] A full list of engagements is available in the --Site-19-- --Site-37-- --Site-22-- Site-92 archives. [[/footnote]].

&gt; **Experiment 5034-1**
&gt; 
&gt; **Conditions:** Upon discovery of SCP-5034, Foundation personnel attempted to remove and contain three marbles from the bowl[[footnote]] Operation conducted in cooperation with the Global Occult Coalition. [[/footnote]].
&gt; **Result:** When removed, all marbles disappeared and reappeared inside the bowl. Containment failure[[footnote]] BK-Class scenario officially declared one hour later. [[/footnote]]. Foundation budget severely impacted.

&gt; **Experiment 5034-2**
&gt; 
&gt; **Conditions:** Upon rediscovery of SCP-5034 in an antique store in Chennai, India, Foundation personnel attempted to remove one marble from the bowl and smash it with a sledgehammer[[footnote]] Constructed via a conjunction of several requisitioned anomalies. [[/footnote]].
&gt; **Result:** Following successful destruction of the marble, it reappeared inside the bowl. Destruction failure. Foundation budget severely impacted.

&gt; **Experiment 5034-3**
&gt; 
&gt; **Conditions:** After tracing the sale of SCP-5034 through a number of private collectors, Foundation personnel attempted to contain one of the marbles while keeping it within the bowl.
&gt; **Result:** Containment successful for six days. However, on the seventh day, Security Officer enters the containment chamber and accidentally releases the marble from the bowl[[footnote]] See Autopsy Report 5034-29331 for full details. [[/footnote]]. Containment failure. Foundation budget severely impacted.

&gt; **Experiment 5034-4**
&gt; 
&gt; **Conditions:** Upon rediscovery of SCP-5034, all available Foundation personnel attempt to smash the marbles with sledgehammers.
&gt; **Result:** Five marbles successfully destroyed[[footnote]] Partial destruction of the sixth entity insufficient due to regenerative capabilities. [[/footnote]]. However, they subsequently reappear inside the bowl. Destruction failure.

&gt; **Experiment 5034-5**
&gt; 
&gt; **Conditions:** Upon rediscovery of SCP-5034, all available Foundation personnel[[footnote]] Operation conducted in cooperation with all remaining world governments under the Pangaea Agreement. [[/footnote]] attempt to smash the marbles with sledgehammers.
&gt; **Result:** Six marbles successfully destroyed. However, they subsequently reappear inside the bowl. Destruction failure[[footnote]] Current hypothesis is that all seven entities must be eliminated to ensure successful termination. [[/footnote]].

&gt; **Experiment 5034-6**
&gt; 
&gt; **Conditions:** Upon rediscovery of SCP-5034, all Foundation personnel attempt to destroy the marbles with whatever tools are on hand.
&gt; 
&gt; **Result:** All seven marbles successfully destroyed. They subsequently reappear inside the bowl[[footnote]] In accordance with joint EC and O5 ruling, mass euthanasia options are currently being considered. [[/footnote]].

------

**Addendum 5034-2:**

As the Foundation budget is now approaching bankruptcy, further experimentation is not possible[[footnote]] Burn our bodies. [[/footnote]].
