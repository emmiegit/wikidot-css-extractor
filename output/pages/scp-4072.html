**Item #:** SCP-4072

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation webcrawler B9G41 is to monitor online digital software distribution programs for instances of SCP-4072. Any and all instances are to be reported and/or removed immediately upon discovery. In the event SCP-4072 is downloaded onto devices not owned by the Foundation or any of its branches, Mobile Task Force Kappa 10, &#34;Skynet&#34; is to be dispatched immediately to administer amnestics and remove instances of SCP-4072 and SCP-4072-X from public custody.

Consoles and handheld devices with SCP-4072 installed on them are to be stored in a 1.6 x 1.6 x 1.3 meter plastic storage tote located in Storage Sector 7 within Site 15.[[footnote]]Containment procedures are being revised to avoid future manifestations of SCP-4072-Alpha.[[/footnote]] During relocation, this plastic storage tote is only to be moved during the daytime, as the risk of an SCP-4072-Alpha manifestation has been shown to be significantly higher during the hours of 6:00 PM to 12:00 AM EST.

Any video games purchased or downloaded from SCP-4072 are to be designated SCP-4072-X. Copies of SCP-4072-X are to be stored on the hard drive of the console SCP-4072 was downloaded onto. D and C-Class personnel, along with foundation researchers[[footnote]]Foundation researchers are only to interact with instances of SCP-4072-1 downloaded above the &#34;Low&#34; download quality level.[[/footnote]], are approved for contact with instances of SCP-4072-X.

Victims of SCP-4072-X instances downloaded on the “Low” or “Very Low” quality setting are to be kept alive for as long as feasibly possible for research purposes. Victims of SCP-4072-X instances downloaded on the &#34;Very High&#34; quality setting, specifically D-Class personnel, are to be released from foundation custody, as they no longer pose a threat to the populace.

**Description:** SCP-4072 is a free digital software distribution service capable of hosting and publicly distributing any known and existing software meeting its requirements to be considered a video game.[[footnote]]These requirements are not yet fully understood.[[/footnote]] Any software downloaded from SCP-4072 tends to be extremely anomalous in nature, with the game itself noticeably different, mostly through removal or alteration of characters, textures, graphics, settings, or events that take place within the normal game. Upon completing an SCP-4072-X instance, a memetic agent will be displayed onscreen. The agent’s effects can take many different forms, ranging from very positive to very negative.

One will also note that SCP-4072-5 takes place in a free-roam, 3D world, akin to that of a game produced with the Unreal Engine game development software.
&gt; 
&gt; **Side Effects:** 12 hours after completing the game&#39;s pacifist route, D-38592 reported unexplained feelings of happiness and elevated resistance to violent intentions, along with a positive outlook on life.

&gt; **Interviewed:** D-39201, the D-Class present in Experiment 4072-3.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Senior Researcher █████████
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** This audio log is from an interview intended for observing D-39201&#39;s behavior after completing SCP-4072-3.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; //Senior Researcher █████████ takes a seat on a chair opposite from D-39201.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Senior Researcher █████████:** D-39201, would you mind telling us what exactly you saw at the end of your previous test?
&gt; 
&gt; //D-39201 remains silent and unmoving for around one minute.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Senior Researcher █████████:** D-39201?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-39201:** It&#39;s all meaningless.
&gt; 
&gt; **Senior Researcher █████████:** D-39201, we don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. Is this in reference to what you saw after completing SCP-4072-3?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-39201:** We&#39;re alone. We&#39;re all hopelessly, insufferably alone. There&#39;s nothing we can do.

**Incident Report:** On 7/21/1986, 10:24 PM EST, advertisements for SCP-4072 were displayed on all existing television channels simultaneously. This is widely considered/accepted to be the first occurrence of an SCP-4072 advertisement in foundation history, and SCP-4072&#39;s origin point.

Amnestics were delivered to the majority of the populace following the incident corresponding to level of exposure. █████ █████████, a civilian, managed to record the commercial&#39;s ending on a Video Home System tape.

**Notes:** Prior to 9/11/2003, SCP-4072 manifested in the form of cartridges instead of downloadable software. It is also heavily implied that SCP-4072 changed its slogan during this period.
