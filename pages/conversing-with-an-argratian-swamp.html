//Transcription of a dialog with the Third Great Swamp of Etun, Kingdom of Fire, Lemuria//

**Tornok Aquor, Apprentice Nature-Speaker:** I have come to communicate with the Swamp as  representative of the Kingdom of Mystery&#39;s College-City of Yolag. I come in peace, offering gifts of of fertilizer, meat, and non-alcoholic spirits. May I speak to the great Swamp?

**Third Great Swamp of Etun:** I reckon you can. [[footnote]] All of the dialog for Etun is written in Grain Lemurian, to indicate a roughness. Because it is difficult to translate into English, a &#34;hillbilly&#34; accent has been given to Etun for the sake of this piece. [[/footnote]]

**Aquor:** Your accent... I do not recognize it, I apologize.

**Etun:** I reckon you wouldn&#39;t. Ya see, it ain&#39;t a Lemurian one; I weren&#39;t born here.

**Aquor:** You weren&#39;t born here?

**Etun:** Ayup.

**Aquor:** So, where were you born?

**Etun:** I was born in Argrat.

**Aquor:** Agrat? I have heard of the land, but I have never been there. How did you come to Lemuria?

**Etun:** Quit it with your fancy talk. We&#39;re just normal folks here, no need to say everythin&#39; so... well-educated.

**Aquor:** The College-City of Yolag requires that I address you formally, oh great Swamp.

**Etun:** Fair enough. Ya want some Nectar?

**Aquor:** No thank you. Tell me, this... you seem rather noxious for a Swamp. Is there any reason?

**Etun:** Noxious? What does that mean?

**Aquor:** It means you have a peculiar... odor about you. Also, several of the animals inhabiting this place seem deformed. Why is that?

**Etun:** I don&#39;t know nothing. Ask my mother. Or my sister.[[footnote]] This is a rough translation; Lemurian swamps are typically hermaphroditic. [[/footnote]]

**Aquor:** Your... mother?

**Etun:** Or my sister. Same thing, really.

**Aquor:**...you mean to say that your mother is also your sister.

**Etun:** And my daughter, too! And my husband. Damn fine husband she is.

**Aquor:** How... how in the Eight Kingdoms is that even possible?

**Etun:** I reckon it&#39;s pretty normal in Argrat to have your family be one person. I&#39;m the daughter of my grandfather&#39;s niece, who is also my grandmother and son.

**Aquor:** ...I... cannot comprehend this.

**Etun:** It&#39;s simple! I am my own daughter!

**Aquor:** But you said your daughter was your wife.

**Etun:** Husband. She is also my mother, my sister, my grandfather, my grandmother, my niece, my nephew, my cousin, my wife, and... myself.

**Aquor:**...so you&#39;re saying that you&#39;re related to yourself.

**Etun:** Yup. 

**Aquor:** T&#39;fossa&#39;q! [[footnote]] Common swear word in the Eight Kingdoms, meaning &#34;smite me&#34;. [[/footnote]].

Shortly following this, Tornok Aquor returned to the College-City of Yolag, and compiled a report stating that &#34;The Study of Sapient Swamps is a waste of time, and should be carried out by the Kingdom of Fire, who have much experience with wasting time.&#34;

In response, Charog Etoi of the Temple-City of Redip, Kingdom of Fire, stated that the Kingdom &#34;would gladly take over this work; it would be far too much to ask the denizens of the Kingdom of Mystery, who live in swamps, to in addition study them.&#34;</textarea></pre>
