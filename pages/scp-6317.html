**Item #:** SCP-6317

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6317 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment unit that has been reinforced with 5.08 cm thick slabs of anti-cronosium.^^[[footnote]] A newly engineered metal that is immune to temporal effects. [[/footnote]]^^

Four armed guards are stationed outside on four-hour rotation shifts. Only staff with Clearance Level 3 or higher are permitted entry into the room, for research purposes only, and must wear special suits that have been reinforced with anti-cronosium.

Prior to entering, and only after being properly equipped, staff members must then say into a tablet embedded in the door, &#34;I want to enter SCP-6317&#39;s room for research purposes only&#34;.^^[[footnote]] This tablet has lie-detection software installed [[/footnote]]^^ Should the result be positive, staff members must then place any time-tracking devices in a storage locker which has been placed 30.48 centimeters to the right of the door.^^[[footnote]] Once inside the containment unit, watches, and clocks on phones, will either stop, or constantly move backwards and forwards [[/footnote]]^^ Otherwise, as in the result of the polygraph is negative, they will be escorted away.^^[[footnote]] This procedure was amended to the Special Containment Procedures after the occurrence of Incident 6317-1 [[/footnote]]^^

SCP-6317 is to be provided with fresh clothes and linen twice a week. Foods and beverages are provided only if the subject is interested. Once a day, the room is to be inspected for any structural damage.^^[[footnote]] Feeding, cleaning, and inspection for structural damage are performed by D-Class personnel, who must also take the lie-detecting test.[[/footnote]]^^ Should there be any, then SCP-6317 is to be placed in a straightjacket, to ensure the restriction of hand movement. Once the subject is successfully restrained, the repairs on the room are to begin immediately. 

In the event of a containment breach, MTF agents, adorned in suits that are reinforced with anti-cronosium, and equipped with tranquilizer guns that have also been constructed from the new metal, are to engage SCP-6317. Once tranquilized, they must then be taken back to their room.

**Description:** SCP-6317 is a female humanoid of Eastern European descent, with blonde hair and green eyes, weighing roughly 49.9 kilograms, and is 157.48 centimeters tall. Despite SCP-6317&#39;s adolescent appearance,^^[[footnote]] 13 years old [[/footnote]]^^ legal documentation has verified their age to be approximately 35 years. This is due to the instances of SCP-6317-P^^[[footnote]] Sub-atomic particles that have temporal properties, and have reversed and halted the aging process on SCP-6317, as well as halted their metabolism [[/footnote]]^^ that are bonded to the host&#39;s D.N.A.. Despite SCP-6317&#39;s physical regression, their intellect remains unaffected.

SCP-6317 has the anomalous ability to affect the flow of time around multiple targets (up to ten)^^[[footnote]] Anymore, and SCP-6317 will become fatigued [[/footnote]]^^ in the following ways:

|| **Sub-ability Description** ||
|| 1. Increase the flow of time to such an extent that the targets rapidly age until they decompose into skeletons. ||
|| 2. Reverse the flow of time to such an extent that the targets are regressed to prenatal non-existence. ||
|| 3. Halt the flow of time around the targets. ||
|| 4. Place targets in indefinite loops. ||
^^[[footnote]] Here, the term &#34;targets&#34; is referring to humans and animals [[/footnote]]^^

**Addendum 6317-A: Discovery and Interview 6317-1**

__**Discovery**__
[[collapsible hideLocation=&#34;both&#34; show=&#34;+ show discovery&#34; hide=&#34;- hide discovery&#34;]]
Site ██ had been developing a time machine in order to go back in time to explore the mysterious circumstances surrounding the collapse of the Bronze Age. The machine began to malfunction, and readings indicated an imminent explosion. All researchers in the chamber, sans Dr. Erica Wilkins, were able to evacuate. Five pieces of shrapnel pierced her body, though no vital organs were pierced. She was taken to an on-site E.R. where the shrapnel was carefully extracted. The pieces were then placed in a plastic bag, which was placed in a standard storage locker. Whereas Dr. Wilkins&#39; wounds should have taken months to heal, they only took a matter of two weeks. In addition to her accelerated healing, Dr. Wilkins also retained no scars from her injuries.

Analysis of the shrapnel revealed that the pieces were in constant loops of decomposition and re-materialization. This behavior resulted in the pieces being designated as SCP-6317-S1 through S5. Further analysis of S1 through S5, viewed under an electron microscope, revealed that they were covered in yellow-colored particles. These were originally designated as SCP-6317, but later re-designated as SCP-6317-P, and were theorized to be the source of the temporal anomalies. Given that instances of SCP-6317-P did not exist prior to the time machine&#39;s explosion, it can be theorized that the synthesis of SCP-6317-P was the result of said incident.

Dr. Wilkins was closely monitored after the discovery of the SCP-6317-P instances. However, she did not display any temporal anomalies herself. After being released, she went back to her duties, and one week went by until an occurrence. After this incident, she was designated as SCP-6317, and placed in a standard humanoid containment unit. The following is an interview, in which SCP-6317 explains what happened at their residence on the morning of June 17, 2021.

**Interviewed:** SCP-6317

**Interviewer:** Dr. Carl Matthews

**Foreword:** A brief discussion about SCP-6317&#39;s first use of time manipulation

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Dr. Matthews:** Good afternoon, SCP-6317.

**SCP-6317:** Good afternoon, Dr. Matthews.

**Dr. Matthews:** Can you please describe in detail what occurred at your home this morning? When you first displayed your anomalous ability.

**SCP-6317:**  Of course. I grabbed the brass knob to my bedroom door, and as I rotated my arm clockwise, my hand began to glow in a light-green hue. The knob then completely decayed in just a matter of ten seconds. Holding the same hand over the hole where the knob used to be, I rotated my arm counter-clockwise. My hand glowed again, and the knob restored itself, taking the same amount of time as the decomposition. I then alerted the site director about what had occurred, and he sent field agents to retrieve me and take me to the facility. Afterwards, I was designated as SCP-6317 and placed in a containment unit. And the sub-atomic particles that entered my body were re-designated as SCP-6317-P.

**Dr. Matthews:** When you used your ability to restore the door knob, why did it stop at the state of where it was at before you grabbed it, instead of being reverted to its copper and zinc components?

**SCP-6317:** It probably stopped there because as I turned my arm counter-clockwise, I was thinking of where I wanted the reversion/restoration to stop.

**Dr. Matthews:** Interesting. This gives me some ideas for testing. There are some more questions I have... However... //[appears to be in thought, followed by looking at his watch]// Hmm... No. I don&#39;t have the time; I&#39;ve got a meeting to attend. I&#39;ll have to save the questions for later. //[Dr. Matthews quickly gathers his documents, followed by getting out of his chair.]// Goodbye, SCP-6317. Have a nice day.

**SCP-6317:** You too, Dr. Matthews. Thank you.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** For now, tests involving SCP-6317&#39;s ability will be performed on mice. Depending on the outcomes of those tests, I may or may not decide to move on to human trials using D-Class personnel.

**Addendum 6317-B: Tests A and B**
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
__**Test A: 18 June, 2021**__
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ show test data&#34; hide=&#34;- hide test data&#34;]]
**Subject:** Live mouse

**Procedure:** SCP-6317 will use their progression sub-ability on the test subject to decompose it all the way into a skeleton, followed immediately by using the regression sub-ability to observe if the subject&#39;s cognitive functions are restored either during or after the body&#39;s restoration.

**Results:** SCP-6317 opened the lid to the test subject&#39;s glass cage. Next, they held their right hand above the subject, followed by using their progression sub-ability. The subject immediately began to convulse as it rapidly aged, followed by becoming motionless as the decomposition into a skeleton began. The entire process took eight seconds.

Immediately after the decomposition came to a halt, SCP-6317 used their regression sub-ability... and in a fast manner. I&#39;d say they rotated their arm as quickly as they could. The test subject&#39;s body then restored itself, taking the same amount of time as the decomposition. The body remained motionless for two minutes before the overseer of the test, Dr. Carl Matthews, concluded that the subject did not regain cognitive functions.

**Analysis:** It seems that even if a body has been deceased for just a couple of seconds, and time is reversed on it to restore its body, it will not regain cognitive functions. And on the subject of regression, what if SCP-6317 was not given a limit? Would the mouse&#39;s corpse have regressed all the way to prenatal non-existence? I guess we will find out in the next test.

~Dr. Matthews.

**Additional comment:** Is it just me, or does Dr. Wilkins appear to be getting younger? She&#39;s 34, but she looks like she&#39;s in her mid to late 20&#39;s now. I ran some photos of her from years 25 through 29 through an analyzer, and her present profile was a match with year 25.

__**Test B - 20 June, 2021**__
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ show test data&#34; hide=&#34;- hide test data&#34;]]
**Subject:** Deceased mouse

**Procedure:** Reverse the flow of time on the test subject&#39;s corpse without providing a limit on how far the regression should proceed.

**Results:** The test subject&#39;s corpse went through the following stages of life, beginning with its current phase: post-reproductive.
* adulthood
* adolescence
* early postnatal
* fetus
* embryo
* prenatal non-existence

The process took only four seconds, half of the duration of either part of Test A&#39;s procedure.

**Analysis:** SCP-6317&#39;s power seems to be growing. Despite that, they are at least able to control it, as they have been observed rotating either arm in both directions, and nothing happened. I asked Director Davidson if he could consider giving Dr. Wilkins her job back, since she has complete control of her ability, but he said that we should give it a couple of months.

~Dr. Matthews

**Additional comment:** Though I am the one who wanted to conduct today&#39;s experiment, I wish there was a way to un-see the results. For some reason, I pictured myself as the mouse, regressing until I was non-existent. I think Dr. Wilkins was unsettled by it too, perhaps even envisioning the same thing... I could see it in her eyes. I am now curious if her time manipulation applies to her own body. For example: if she were to experience a laceration, would her body reverse the flow of time on the wound? I want to run a test to find out, but... I will give it a week. Her mental wellbeing is not in a proper state right now.

__**Document 6317-1: Journal Entry - 20 June, 2021**__
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ show entry&#34; hide=&#34;- hide entry&#34;]]
The results of today&#39;s test made me very unsettled. Sure, the mouse was dead as it was regressed to prenatal non-existence. But the fact that I can reverse the flow of time on a target to the point that it becomes non-existent… [shudders]. And to be honest, I pictured myself in place of that mouse, regressing until I was non-existent. Who&#39;s to say that won&#39;t happen?! I&#39;m getting younger every day, after all! I&#39;m 21 today. What will I be tomorrow? 17? 13? At least my intellect is staying intact as I get younger. Despite fearing my power of time manipulation, I am still curious as to how far I can go with it. Can I only affect the flow of time on a designated target, or can I affect time itself? Do I have more time-related abilities? Is one of my (possibly) innate sub-abilities time travel? I must find out.

~Dr. Erica Wilkins a.k.a. SCP-6317

**Additional comment:** Every day that goes by, I find myself eating and drinking less and less. Also, ever since that day at my house, I haven&#39;t had any dreams. I **am** able to sleep (though it&#39;s not necessary)… I just can&#39;t dream. These side-effects of my ability are beginning to worry me…

Three days have gone by without an entry because one: I was depressed, and two: I was experiencing anxiety. The depression began on the 18th, after I passed by some of my colleagues while being escorted to a testing room. I waved and said hello to them, but they either ignored me, or looked the other way and called me a monster... And the anxiety was from worrying that my reverse aging was not going to stop, as well as the unpleasant side-effects of my ability. Now, I don&#39;t have to fret anymore. For three days, I have remained at 21 years. I think it is safe to assume that the reverse aging has stopped. Thank goodness. I was not looking forward to reliving my teenage years… or being the first 6-year-old researcher. As for the side-effects... I don&#39;t really care anymore. And even though the depression is over,  the emotional scars from how my colleagues treated me run deep...

Two more days, and testing can resume. This time, three days have gone by without an entry, because I was so caught up in reading the printed manuscripts of all of the stories that my daughter Clara wrote.

During my time off, I have heard, many times, Dr. Matthews talking to the guards outside, though I cannot make out what the conversation is about. It doesn&#39;t last long though, and it always ends with one of the guards asking him to leave. Why do you want in here so badly, Carl? Please don&#39;t let it be for anything that could result in termination. I&#39;d feel bad if my protégé were to lose his job, especially since I&#39;m the one who helped him get it... 

(*sigh*) On a brighter note... I have been curious about what else I can do with my time manipulation. So, I decided to conduct my own experiments using some of this journal&#39;s pages. I now have the following sub-abilities. The effects of these two can be cancelled by snapping my fingers:

1. Suspending time: By motioning a stop gesture with either hand, I can halt the flow of time on a target. If performed on a target as it is falling, then it will float in mid-air, and remain there motionless until I cancel it.

2. Indefinite Loop: This one was a bit tricky to discover. I knew that I must have had the time-related ability to place targets in loops, but I had no idea how to trigger it. I eventually figured it out, though. All I have to do is point at a target, have it perform an action, and then point at it again. It will then perform that action in a loop until I cancel it.

I tried using these sub-abilities on multiple targets, by tearing off small pieces of paper (the size of peas), and discovered that I can only affect up to ten targets at once. Anymore, and I become fatigued.

With these two sub-abilities, along with progression and regression, I now have total control over a target&#39;s perception of time. But, again, do I have the ability to travel through time? I don&#39;t fear these abilities anymore, and I want to do more with them! Also, it has gotten to the point to where I eat or drink only if I am interested. The instances of SCP-6317-P that are bonded to my D.N.A. must not have only reversed and halted my aging process, but they also halted my metabolism. These side-effects… I no longer consider myself human; I am just another inhuman thing like all of the others at this site.

~SCP-6317

**Additional comment:** After my three days of reading, it has occurred to me that my current predicament is the same as that of the main character in Clara&#39;s latest story: &#39;The Time Sorceress&#39;. Though the locations and names of people are different, the events that have been transpiring are the same. Clara did say that the idea just came to her, though. So that rules out her being clairvoyant. That still leaves the question of whether or not she has the same anomalous ability as SCP-5002. I sure hope not, for her sake.

[[collapsible hideLocation=&#34;both&#34; show=&#34;+ show interview&#34; hide=&#34;- hide interview&#34;]]
**Interviewed:** SCP-6317

**Interviewer:** Dr. Carl Matthews

**Foreword:** A brief discussion about SCP-6317&#39;s latest Journal entry

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Dr. Matthews:** Good afternoon, SCP-6317.

**SCP-6317:** Good afternoon, Dr. Matthews.

**Dr. Matthews:** I read your latest journal entry.

**SCP-6317:** What exactly do you want to go over?

**Dr. Matthews:** Well... I agree with what you said: that what has happened to you is vaguely similar to what happened to the protagonist of your daughter&#39;s latest story, &#39;The Time Sorceress&#39;.

**SCP-6317:** Did you take Clara in for questioning?

**Dr. Matthews:** Actually, I appointed a field agent to monitor her. He stated in his latest report that he saw her typing up a new story: one about her finding an abandoned wolf pup, taking it home, and raising it. So far, nothing has happened.

**SCP-6317:** //[gives a sigh of relief]// Good. I was so worried that she might have the same ability as the late SCP-5002. I&#39;m so glad that is not the case.

**Dr. Matthews:** Me too. //[appears to be in thought]//

**SCP-6317:** Is there something else you want to discuss...?

**Dr. Matthews:** Well... It&#39;s not part of your entry, but it is something I&#39;d like to bring up: Since you have exceptional control over your ability, and there have been no incidents, the Foundation has considered allowing you to resume your research duties. They want to give it a couple of more months, though. 

**SCP-6317:** Okay.

**Dr. Matthews:** We think that with your help, we could get a better understanding of what went wrong with the time machine. We&#39;d also like to use your ability, but only here at Site ██, in order to prevent on-site accidents.

**SCP-6317:** That makes sense. There has been a rise in accidents recently.

**Dr. Matthews:** Indeed. And the regression sub-ability could be used to temporarily fix medical issues, //[rubs his left wrist]// like carpal tunnel for example. However, I think we will have to experiment a little bit more with regression before it can be utilized to such an extent. That will have to wait for future tests, though. Tomorrow we&#39;re going to begin experimentation with the indefinite loop and suspension of time sub-abilities. I know you conducted your own experiments with them, but I want to see them with my own eyes.

**SCP-6317:** I understand. In that case, can I make a suggestion for an experiment that could utilize both sub-abilities?

**Dr. Matthews:** What do you have in mind?

**SCP-6317:** Something simple... like tossing a coin, stopping it at the peak of its ascent, and then looping its midair rotation for... Well... I will let you determine that.

**Dr. Matthews:** Sounds like a plan. Again, I have some more questions, but... //[rubs his left wrist again]// Ugh... My carpal tunnel is flaring up again. Sorry, SCP-6317. I have to go now. //[Dr. Matthews gathers his documents, followed by getting out of his chair.]//

**SCP-6317:** //[keeps their gaze on him as he makes his way to the door]//I understand, Dr. Matthews. Have a good day.

**Dr. Matthews:** Thank you. You have a good day as well.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** After the interview, SCP-6317 was escorted back to their room. Security footage shows them sitting at the edge of their bed, closing their eyes, and holding their hands out in front of them. My interpretation of the scene is that SCP-6317 was trying to unlock their (possibly) innate sub-ability of time-travel. I noticed that security outside of SCP-6317&#39;s room has doubled from two guards to four. That was no doubt Director Davidson&#39;s doing.

**Subject:** D-68921

**Procedure 1:** D-68921 will throw the ball, SCP-6317 will freeze it in mid-return, and then D-68921 will grab the ball out of the air.

**Procedure 2:** D-68921 will flip a quarter, and then, as soon as it reaches the peak of the ascent, SCP-6317 will place it in a loop for 5 minutes.

**Procedure 1 Results:** D-68921 walked over to the ball, which was suspended in mid-air, and then grabbed it.

**Procedure 2 Results:** The coin stayed spinning at the peak of its ascent for 5 minutes.

**Analysis:** Though I am satisfied with the results of this test, I am dissatisfied with **myself**, because I, in my old age of 60, prioritized this test over the one I had originally planned. I am, of course, referring to the test for observing if SCP-6317&#39;s time manipulation applies to their own body. I&#39;m sure that If I were younger, I would not have forgotten... nor would I have carpal tunnel. I **must** become young again. And I know how.

**Compiled security footage**

//The first security footage shows Dr. Matthews and Dr. Hendricks in front of Storage Locker 6317. Dr. Matthews unlocks it, and takes out the bag containing SCP&#39;s 6317-S1 through S5. After Dr. Matthews re-secures the locker, he and Dr. Hendricks leave the area.//

//The second footage, recorded from a camera that has audio capability, shows Dr. Matthews and Dr. Hendricks stopping in front of a lab.//

**Dr. Hendricks:** //[appears to be suspicious of Dr. Matthews]// I know what your plan is, Dr. Matthews.

**Dr. Matthews:** //[turns towards his protégé]// Do you now?

**Dr. Hendricks:** I put the clues together after reading your latest test analysis, and after seeing what you needed me to accompany you for.

**Dr. Matthews:** Tell me then: what do I plan to do with these pieces of shrapnel?

**Dr. Hendricks:** You plan on scraping off Dr. Wilkins&#39; dried blood... blood that contains instances of SCP-6317-P. You&#39;re going to liquify the blood, and then inject yourself with it.

**Dr. Matthews:** Such a clever girl you are, Amelia. I&#39;m glad you are my protégé. So, do you plan to stop me?

**Dr. Hendricks:** I am stronger than I look.

**Dr. Matthews:** And I have a taser. Why don&#39;t you just go get help instead. But even if you do, it will be futile.

**Dr. Hendricks:** What do you mean?

**Dr. Matthews:** I knew you would betray me, so I picked this lab, since it is so far away from any guard. By the time you get back, I will have already injected myself.

**Dr. Hendricks:** //[backs away while shaking her head]// You&#39;re insane...

Dr. Hendricks then runs away. Once she is out of sight, Dr. Matthews enters the lab.

//The third and final security footage is recorded from another camera that has audio capability, and shows Dr. Matthews going through the process of liquifying the dried blood from the five pieces of shrapnel, followed by injecting himself with the liquified blood. Five seconds after the injection, Dr. Hendricks and two guards enter the lab.//

**Dr. Matthews:** You&#39;re too late, just like I said, Amelia. I have already injected myself. Oh... I can already feel myself getting younger... And it feels like it&#39;s beginning with my skin; I can feel it getting tighter.

**Guard 1:** It&#39;s getting tighter, but... not because you are getting younger.

**Dr. Matthews:** What?! //[he looks at his arms, and sees that he is rapidly aging]// No!

Dr. Matthews then grabs Dr. Hendricks by her shoulders

**Dr. Matthews:** Please help me, Amelia! Please make it stop!

**Dr. Hendricks:** //[tries to break free from his grasp]// No! Let go of me!

**Guard 2:** //[while prying Dr. Matthews away]// You heard the lady! Let go! //[manages to release the doctor&#39;s grasp]//

**Dr. Matthews:** Help... Me...

Dr. Matthews then decomposes into a skeleton, which drops to the floor in a pile of bones.

**Dr. Hendricks:** Oh, Dr. Matthews...

After this incident, Dr. Hendricks was promoted to be the new overseer of SCP-6317 research, the key to Storage Locker 6317 was left in the care of Director Davidson, and new security measures were put in place for SCP-6317&#39;s Special Containment Procedures.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ show incident report&#34; hide=&#34;- hide incident report]]
I woke up around 08:30 this morning, feeling like my sides were on fire. I eventually couldn&#39;t take the pain anymore, and I collapsed to my knees and screamed. Some sort of shockwave then emanated from my body, and spread throughout the entire site. I passed out after that. When I regained consciousness, I noticed that my clothes did not fit me anymore. It was too much of a hassle to hold my pants up while trying to walk. So, I just took my clothes off and wrapped myself in a blanket. I looked in my bathroom&#39;s mirror, and was shocked to see my thirteen-year-old self staring back at me. The time was still 08:30 am. But I knew that hours went by after I passed out. It seemed like time, at least for the site, had become frozen. Assuming that everyone outside had also been frozen, I used my progression sub-ability on the door to my containment unit, and then walked right out. Sure enough, as I looked into each room that I passed, my suspicion was confirmed. I tried to undo the damage... but to no avail. Electronics were working. However, the security monitors were just looping the footage that was taken between 08:29 and 08:30. I was able to contact O5 Command, and informed them of what had occurred. They told me to stay put, and that they were going to send people who were equipped with suits that had been reinforced with a newly-engineered metal called anti-cronosium, which is immune to temporal properties.

After two months, Site ██ resumed operations. Readings indicate that personnel who were affected by the phenomenon are still alive. They have all been placed in a large, climate-controlled storage room. SCP-6317&#39;s room was reinforced with 5.08 cm (2 inch) thick slabs of anti-cronosium, and the rule of checking the room for any structural defects was added to 6317&#39;s Special Containment Procedures. Incident 6317-2 has been referred to as &#39;the Site ██ Incident&#39;, and referred to by some staff members as &#34;The Great Freeze of Site ██&#34;. To date, we have no idea what caused the incident to occur, and luckily it was the only instance of it. SCP-6317 has remained at thirteen years old since then. Testing has resumed, and so far their (possibly) innate ability to travel through time has not been awakened. But when and if it does, perhaps it could give us a better understanding of what exactly went wrong with the time machine. It is because of that accident that Site ██, as well as other locations, never constructed a new one; the risk of another person becoming just like Dr. Wilkins is too high.

Microscopic analysis of the paper that Clara Wilkins&#39; story was written on, revealed that on every blue line of the notebook paper, are the repeating words: Whatever is written on this paper will happen to one of its owner&#39;s loved ones. This is my revenge.

Luckily, we have confiscated all of these papers, and will soon write an article about them. The question remains, though... Whose revenge?

I am able to dream again. However, they are not dreams, but memories; I remember every day, hour, minute, and second of my life... even prenatal memories. Thus, I plan to use my (possibly) innate sub-ability of time-travel to go backwards in time to one hour before I purchased that anomalous package of paper. I will enter the store I purchased it from, and buy every package of it that was on that shelf. There were only ten of them at the time. However, it was back-to-school season. So, there could have been fifty to one hundred packages one hour earlier. I don&#39;t care; I will purchase all of them. I don&#39;t know what will happen to me after I finish that transaction. But, no matter the result, I am not afraid.

If my plan fails, then it means that it is not that anomalous package of paper that is responsible for everything that has occurred. The only other possibility is that a vengeful anomaly was targeting me specifically, and possessed that package of paper to ensure that something would happen to me. If that is the case, then I will get revenge on that anomaly - it used my daughter to get to me! And I will not let that go unpunished...
