**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-6317 is to be contained within a standard anomalous humanoid dormitory and provided with amenities at the approval of Dr. Glass. Additionally, SCP-6317 is to meet weekly with site psychologists to screen for long term exposure to cognitohazardous matierals. 

SCP-6317-1 is to be contained within a standard anomalous item containment locker. At the request of SCP-6317, testing with SCP-6317-1 is currently prohibited. Instead, SCP-6317 has provided Foundation staff with a collection of materials for review. Foundation staff are to observe caution while reviewing materials and are to affirm that they are currently living their best life.

**Description:**

[[include component:image-block
| name=
http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-6317/Polaroid_OneStep.jpg
| caption=SCP-6317-1
]]

SCP-6317 is the designation given to Hana “Iris” Thompson, an Asian-American female of average build and height. Prior to containment, SCP-6317 was a member of the senior class of Bear Ridge High School and President of the Newspaper club. This is where she is believed to have first encountered SCP-6317-1.

SCP-6317-1 is a Polaroid 1000 Land Camera with “Property of KLHS” carved into its side. The school purchased SCP-6317-1 for the club from an alumnus, with the hopes of providing a more authentic feel to the school paper. SCP-6317-1 has no innate anomalous properties aside from a seemingly infinite amount of film and battery life.

SCP-6317&#39;s anomalous properties manifest when interacting with the photos produced by SCP-6317-1. By physically manipulating the photos (cutting, scratching, pasting, etc.), SCP-6317 can alter the memories of the events taking place in the photo. Through addition or removals of certain aspects of the photo, subjects receive conflicting memories, causing them to be unable to recall events captured in the photo. SCP-6317 herself is not immune to this affect, and efforts to remediate her gaps in memory are currently ongoing.

[[size large]]//Discovery//[[/size]]
[[/=]]
-----
SCP-6317’s anomalous properties were discovered following a tip from Researcher Blaire’s son, Anthony; a senior at Bear Ridge and someone SCP-6317 was noted to be romantically pursuing. After reading the Homecoming edition of the school paper, Researcher Blaire noted that his son was having difficulty recalling the events and aftermath of the game. Anthony showed Blaire a photo in the newspaper he was in with his friends. Upon seeing the paper, Researcher Blaire found that one of the kid’s faces was scratched out, with SCP-6317 awkwardly edited into the photo.

Furthermore, Anthony insisted that both SCP-6317 and his friend were present.[[footnote]]Text messages reviewed by Researcher Blaire following this event revealed that SCP-6317 was unable to attend due to a conflict with the school’s cross country team.[[/footnote]] Researcher Blaire instructed his son to get some rest and began a formal examination of the newspaper. Through inspection, the newspaper was noted to have slightly elevated cognitohazard levels consistent with anomalous interference. Researcher Blaire sent the paper to Site-19, and was tasked to passively monitor the situation for continued anomalous effects.

The following interview was conducted by SCP-6317 prior to the publication of the Homecoming edition of the school newspaper. This is also the first noted instance of SCP-6317 feeling the effects of her anomalous properties.

**Hana:** (Mumbling) Alright, that should be everything set up. //&lt;She claps.&gt;// Alright! Thank you for taking the time to sit for an interview, Principal Kruek.

**Kruek:** Always, Hana. You know how much I love to interact with my students. Now, //&lt;he leans back in his chair&gt;// How about that game, huh?

**Kruek:** Heard? You weren&#39;t there?

**Hana:** I-uh. //&lt;She pauses.&gt;//

**Kruek:** You alright, kiddo?

 **Hana:** Yeah, sorry. Brain freeze, you know? //&lt;She produces a photograph from her bag. The photo shows a group of football players with Hana awkwardly cropped in.&gt;// I was with Anthony and his friends. I think we got appetizers afterwards too.

**Kruek:** I was going to say. It would be unlike you to miss such an important event. Especially, the last Homecoming you’ll ever see.

//&lt;He picks up the football sitting on the edge of his desk.&gt;//

**Kruek:** But hey, it wouldn&#39;t be the first time someone slacked senior year. Hell, [[span style=&#34;filter: blur(5px);&#34;]]Just Some Guy[[/span]] won us the game and then comes to school saying he wasn’t there; like anyone could forget Homecoming! He’ll be running laps until finals with that attitude.

**Hana:** Wait, sorry who are you talking about?

**Kruek:** [[span style=&#34;filter: blur(5px);&#34;]]Just Some Guy[[/span]]. Don&#39;t you remember him? He&#39;s my starting wide receiver. Aren’t you supposed to be the sports reporter?

**Hana:** Rhea took that position so I could take a more direct role in editing.

**Kruek:** Ah that&#39;s right! She interviewed me after the game. A lot of promise in that one, and only a sophomore.

**Hana:** Yes, she&#39;s //quite// the prodigy. Anyways, what&#39;s your plan for-

**Kruek:** You know, she actually won that writing award thing again. You won that a couple of years ago, right?

**Hana:** Yes. I won it when //I// was a sophomore.

**Kruek:** Looks like we&#39;ll have no problems finding a new president when you graduate. You should be very proud of what you&#39;ve been able to accomplish, and I know you&#39;ll train Rhea well.

**Hana:** Oh...Thanks.

**Kruek:** You seem a little down, Hana. Something on your mind?

**Hana:** Just thinking about the end of the year is all.

**Kruek:** Ah, I remember that feeling.

**Hana:** You do?

//&lt;The faint sound of static can be heard.&gt;//

**Kruek:** Truth is, high school&#39;s just a phase, Hana. Life only gets better after you graduate. When I was in your shoes, I felt the same way. All the Homecoming games and marching band tunes fade away after a while. Eventually you just have to face the music.

**Hana:** I’m not sure I’m ready to leave yet. There’s still so much I need to do before June.

**Kruek:** Well, you better step to it, kid. This is the last chance you’ll have to see all of your friends before they move on and you become a memory.

**Hana:** Huh?

**Kruek:** You remember all those nights you spent awake staring at your ceiling wondering if you were doing enough? It’ll never be enough. No matter if you had a year or the rest of your life. Your regrets will only come to you in once fond memories of faces you barely remember.

//&lt;Hana holds her hands to the side of her head. The sound of static is overwhelming.&gt;//

**Kruek:** You won&#39;t be remembered here, Hana. No matter how much you try.

//&lt;Silence&gt;//

**Kruek:** Hana? Hana? Bueller? Bueller?

**Hana:** Wha? Huh?

**Kruek:** That was the bell. I think it’s time you return to class now. Thank you for the interview, Hana.

A copy of the Homecoming edition of the newspaper has been attached below following extensive review. According to SCP-6317, the Homecoming paper is one of the most read of the year, with a reprint needed to fulfill the demands of the community. Exposure to the newspaper was followed by a noted withdrawal of an unknown student from the Bear Ridge database, as well as other minor anomalous phenomena.

**Abernathy:** Oh? Are you having a hard time keeping on top of everything?

**Hana:** But-but I thought I was doing so well. What happened?

**Abernathy** Hana, dear. Your friends and teachers have expressed a lot of worry to me about you. Rhea said she found you nearly passed out in the darkroom the other day.

**Hana:** I was just resting my eyes. Besides, don’t most people fall asleep at school?

**Abernathy:** Not surrounded by paper scraps and rubber cement they don’t. When was the last time you saw your friends?

**Hana:** It had to have been during break. I think I went skiing with [[span style=&#34;filter: blur(5px);&#34;]]My First Crush[[/span]] and  [[span style=&#34;filter: blur(5px);&#34;]]Forgotten Friend[[/span]]. I also went to Anthony&#39;s track championship. A really nice person took a photo of us outside of the stadium and then he took me out to eat at a really nice Italian restaurant.

**Abernathy:** And are you sure that&#39;s how things went?

**Hana:** What?

**Abernathy:** Hana, from what Anthony has told me, he sees you as a really good friend. He turned you down at Homecoming. Don’t you remember? He&#39;s with [[span style=&#34;filter: blur(5px);&#34;]]Someone Better Than You[[/span]] now. He told me that you stopped answering his texts so he broke things off.

Even your parents called me to say that you never left the house during break.

**Hana:** That&#39;s...Impossible. I took all those photos.

**Abernathy:** The camera sign-out sheet says that Rhea was the last person to take the camera out before break. She said she was doing a piece on how seniors are spending their last winter break before college.

**Hana:** No! That&#39;s not how it happened. You have to believe me.

**Abernathy:** Your friends miss you, Hana. You used to do everything together and now you&#39;re throwing it all away for what?

**Hana:** I feel like I&#39;m going to be sick.

**Abernathy:** We know what you’ve done, Hana. We live in every scar and glue patch on your hands. Maybe when you look back, you’ll remember us in those.

//&lt;The sound of static is overwhelming.&gt;//

**Abernathy:** All their faces, Hana, do they mean anything to you anymore? When you see them in the hallway do you see where their eyes are? Their mouths? They speak to you, Hana, but you no longer answer.

Of the students I interviewed, a majority of them took the winter break to make memories with friends, bring home awards for Bear Ridge, or cried into their pillows about the prospect of leaving all they&#39;ve ever known. Overwhelmingly though, students expressed excitement for the remainder of the year, commenting specifically on the exciting events planned by the student government.

For some of you, this will be your last chance to make memories here, and it would be heartbreaking for you to forget us here at Bear Ridge. Good luck with the rest of your year seniors![[/span]]

College applications, last minute tests, the overwhelming feeling that you gave all of yourself to something that won&#39;t remember you when you leave. All of these feelings are too much for anyone to handle without support. As such, I have gathered some fun activities that can be used to decrease stress.
* **Meditation** - A good way to relax in a pinch. All you need is some calm music, a place to sit, and a way to remember what exactly it is you&#39;re looking for in doing this.
* **Scrapbooking** - As editor of the newspaper, I spend a lot of time working with photos. Scrapbooking is a fun way to curate all your memories from the past few years exactly how you want to remember them. With some glue and scissors, as well as a cute scrapbook, you too can lie and say you had a good time in high school.
* **Spending Ceaseless Nights Crying into a Pillow** - Nothing gets rid of stress better than releasing all of that energy into your pillow every night. Friends not inviting you out anymore? Break ups? Poor ranking? Doctor says it&#39;s best to head straight for the pillow. Bonus points if you can manage to keep yourself from crying until your classmates can&#39;t see you! [[/span]]

The height of SCP-6317&#39;s anomalous properties manifested on June 19th, 2016, the night of Bear Ridge High School&#39;s prom. SCP-6317 reported that she has no memories of the night in question, nor does she have any recollection of how she ended up in the Foundation&#39;s care. Researcher Blaire was notified by Anthony of the night&#39;s events. Due to SCP-6317&#39;s feelings towards him, Anthony suffered only minor symptoms from SCP-6317&#39;s cognitohazardous materials. A copy of the phone call between Anthony and Researcher Blaire can be seen below.

Sure, she may have taken our memories, identities, and senior year from us, but can you really blame her? She deserved to be at those football games and charity events while we got the enriching experience of sitting as neat paper cut outs on the darkroom floor.

**Hana:** I-I can&#39;t even remember your faces anymore.

//&lt;She walks off the stage an approaches the nearest student.&gt;//

**Hana:** Y-your name was John, right? James? Didn&#39;t we have the lead roles in the play this year?

//&lt;She approaches another student.&gt;//

**Hana:** Amanda? That&#39;s you right? We passed notes during the basketball finals. You told me you loved me.

//&lt;The student stares at her. She drops to her knees and grips the hem of the student&#39;s dress.&gt;//
