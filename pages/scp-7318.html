**SCP-7318 file**

Containment class: Safe
Disruption class: Dark
Risk class: Notice
Esoteric class: Anomalous

SCP-7318 was retrieved from a roadside diner in Southern Africa on the first of February 2024. It is an object that has apparently become disconnected from the idea of sight on account of it interacting unusually with photons. The universe itself seemingly doesn&#39;t know what it is, and the light given off by it causes it to have the appearance of an insane amalgamation of random objects &#34;clipping&#34; into each other while growing larger and then shrinking out of view. These objects have only ever included everyday objects, such as trash bins, TV remotes, half-eaten pies and laundry irons. But from a purely objective perspective, what SCP-7318 is is a ketchup bottle. If you close your eyes or otherwise ignore how it looks, it can be touched, picked up and held. It has a cap on the top, which will produce ketchup is the object is turned upside down and gently squeezed. The ketchup doesn&#39;t have the visual features of it&#39;s container and seems to have been manufactured by the Kraft Heinz Company. 7318 contained 18 ounces of ketchup, and based on it&#39;s shape resembles a 20 ounce bottle. This may hint to the object having been in use before, thus gaining it&#39;s anomalous characteristics at a later date. Due to this detail Kraft Heinz hasn&#39;t been questioned on SCP-7318. 

**Transcript of experiment on the contents of SCP-7318, 3 February 2024**
**Carried out by Junior researcher Anré Mayt, assisted by D-078**

//M: Good morning, Mr D. Since it&#39;s almost the end of your stay here at the foundation we actually 
        got you something nice today. Obey the relayed instructions, Mr D, with as little deviation as 
        possible. You are wearing a blindfold. Before you is a table with a hotdog and a bottle of tomato 
        sauce. Apply the condiment to the hotdog and just eat it. I swear on my life that this isn&#39;t 
        dangerous, Mr D.//

     **D-078 complies, the hotdog is consumed**

//D-078: I have never felt so intense eating a damn hotdog.
           M: Yeah, sorry about that. Now please tell me, are you feeling well?
   D-078: I think so.
           M: Excellent, and tell me, how did it taste?
   D-078: I don&#39;t know what you want, it tasted like a hotdog with ketchup on it.
           M: Wonderful, you are now to turn around, not look at the table, take off the blindfold and 
                return to your quarters. And also relax, this was like really safe.//

**D-078 complies, the experiment ends**



**SCP-7318 is kept at a low-security SCP facility in Hout Bay, Capetown, South Africa. It doesn&#39;t have a dedicated room, and is kept in a cardboard box labeled appropriately**</textarea></pre>
