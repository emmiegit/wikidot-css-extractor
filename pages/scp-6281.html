**Item #:** 6281

**Object Class:** Safe // Flor Galana[[footnote]]Item aids the Foundation in partially containing itself and/or other anomalies, but cannot be fully contained for logistical and/or ethical reasons.[[/footnote]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6281 is to remain inside the cave where it was found. A site constructed at the mouth of the cave, designated Site-Eta, conceals its entrance. MTF-Unknown-3 are to remain on-site and maintain a rotating shift that ensures a minimum of twelve operatives on duty at all times to carry out basic upkeep and prevent unauthorized access to the site. MTF-Unknown-3 are not to be informed of SCP-6281. They will instead be informed that Site-Eta is an auxiliary containment unit for temporary holdings of safe-class entities. Knowledge of Site-Eta or SCP-6281 is prohibited to personnel without O5 authorization. Personnel leaving Site-Eta are to be administered amnestics to ensure no memory of the site remains, unless granted O5 authorization. 

--Attempts to contain SCP-6281-Z are currently prohibited. Whether SCP-6281-Z is an anomalous event in need of containment is uncertain, however, the risks posed by the methods required to attempt containment have been deemed more severe than the risk of allowing it to remain potentially uncontained.--

Attempts to contain SCP-6281-Z have been authorized. Containment efforts are currently underway.

**Description:** 

SCP-6281 is an obsidian black monolith measuring exactly 1x1x7 meters. Thirty illuminated blue bands 1 cm in height ring the surface of the monolith in equally spaced intervals. One hundred and four different models of electrical access ports encompass the seventh ring. Thirty-two models have been identified, and include multiple iterations of display, audio, and serial ports ranging from 1969 to present day, including Foundation Secure Models 1 through 4. SCP-6281 is also capable of connecting to devices via Bluetooth, appearing as   █▓▒░♜░▒▓█   up to a range of 7 meters from the monolith, and does not require a password to connect. 

Connecting to SCP-6281 using any of these methods results in the connected device losing all previous functionality, and booting up to a black screen with the word &#34;WELCOME&#34; appearing in the center in a font size suitable for the device. An empty bar below the message, like those found in common search engines, is displayed for input.


The bar functions as a standard search bar, compatible with all input methods connected during testing, including speech recognition. A Foundation laptop with a removed modem was issued to Site-Eta to access SCP-6281 for testing. Extensive testing with this laptop has shown that direct questions, names, places, and dates are all compatible entries into the search bar. 

Entering a question results in a page giving a highly detailed, objective answer. Documented instances include:

The full catalog of answers given by SCP-6281 is contained at Site-Eta on paper files. Any use of information obtained from SCP-6281 must be authorized by two separate O5 council members, and if authorized, may only be presented as a product of “outside consultation.”

Entering a name or location into SCP-6281 results in a page containing a basic history about the subject. Further details or more specific information can be acquired by asking for it as a direct question. The information isn&#39;t limited to past events. For still living individuals; it also includes major events that will transpire in their future, going so far as to include a date and cause of death. For locations; future major events that will occur at it, as well as the date and means of its destruction, are also included.

Entering a date gives all major historical events that transpired during it. The window can be as general as a year, or as specific as a day in that year. Again, the information is not limited to past dates.

Whether this information is stored within SCP-6281 itself, or determined from outside input or calculations prior to presenting it, is unknown. Attempts to ask questions about SCP-6281 to determine its source and functions have so far only resulted in the message: __I&#39;M SORRY: I DON&#39;T HAVE THAT INFORMATION__. As of this report, all information pertaining to future events obtained from SCP-6281 has proven true.

While SCP-6281 is displaying any page of information, a footnote at the bottom of the page reads __Edit__. Selecting this footnote allows information on the page to be edited. Brief testing concluded that editing information residing in the future results in automatic updates to any related pages in order to align the information on them with the changes made manually. These alterations come true just as consistently as unedited information.

Information as far as June 7, 2177AD can be requested. Attempting to enter a date past this point, asking a question that exceeds this date, or editing any existing date past this point, is met with the message: __ERROR: TIME DOES NOT EXIST__ (See further details on June 7, 2177, below).

Testing on altering information residing in the past was approved on January 27, 2022, but no test was ever conducted. Testing was reapproved on February 25, 2022, then again on February 28, 2022. In both instances, no recorded test was ever conducted despite records noting the beginning of testing. [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3936 Exclusionary Site-02][[footnote]]One of a series of installations designed to retain information following reality shifts or other temporal restructuring events.[[/footnote]] was consulted, but no retroactive alterations to records could be found. All three tests were deemed successful beyond expected projections, and testing on changing information residing in the past was subsequently prohibited on March 1, 2022. 

The cave SCP-6281 resides in is located on the East coast of The United States, 15 kilometers south of ████████████. The cave is composed of a mixture of igneous and sedimentary rock common to the area. It consists of a single tunnel, measuring an average height and width of 7 meters, and continues 70 meters downwards at a slope of 7 degrees before opening into a dome chamber with a diameter of 14 meters. SCP-6281 sits in the center of this chamber.

Despite these measurements, geological experts brought to Site-Eta insist the cave shows no signs of artificial creation and is consistent with natural formation.

**Discovery of SCP-6281 and Incident Report:**

First known discovery of SCP-6281 was by Joseph D. Knights, who took to posting information obtained from SCP-6281 online under the alias of [REDACTED] with claims to knowing the future. When a sufficient number of these predictions came true, automated Foundation monitoring systems flagged the individual, and MTF Charlie-9 was sent to apprehend the subject for questioning.

Under questioning, the subject informed MTF operatives of the cave with SCP-6281 within and his experience interacting with the anomaly using his mobile phone. 

When questioned if he had made any edits to the future, the subject confirmed adding exceptionally improbable events to the years 2020 and 2021, prior to those dates, in an effort to test the capabilities of the anomaly. All edits made by the subject are accounted for in world history and a record of the questioning and an extensive list of edits made can be found in a paper file on-site with SCP-6281.

Questions pertaining to edits that the subject made to the past have been approved for digital records for the purpose of accurately presenting SCP-6281’s anomalous properties.

**Interrogation Conducted By:** MTF Officer David Attleburg

**Subject:** Joseph D. Knights

= **&lt;Interrogation In Progress At Opening Remark&gt;**

**MTF Officer David Attleburg:** Just a few more questions and I’m sure we’ll be able to let you go. Did you also use your phone to make any edits to the past?

**Subject:** I didn’t.

**MTF Officer David Attleburg:** Really? You decided to edit all those events in the future but never tried to edit the past?

**Subject:** Well, I planned to; a bunch of times I was going to change something in the past, and I had an idea what I was going to change, but it’s like the moment I tapped the edit button, I couldn’t remember what I was going to change it to anymore.

**MTF Officer David Attleburg:** So you never made any changes to the past?

**Subject:** Not that I remember.

[[/div]]

It is unknown how many changes the subject made to the past, or what those changes included. Nonetheless, their result is clearly observable as current history.

The handheld phone the subject used to connect to SCP-6281 has been confiscated, all records of information obtained from SCP-6281 posted online have been located and expunged by Foundation web-crawlers, and amnestics have been administered to the subject. 

Under order of O5-1, the MTFCharlie-9 has also been administered Amnestics.
 
**June 7, 2177AD:**

Investigation into the date, June 7, 2177AD, has been conducted with little success. 

Information up to 6 June, 2177AD, at 11:59pm is accessible and describes an Earth which aligns with projected technological advancements for the era.

When questioned on the status of any individual or location on June 7, 2177AD, at 12:00am, SCP-6281 responds __ALL IS WHITE__, which is a notable difference from the response to all currently tested times following it, which result in __ERROR: TIME DOES NOT EXIST__. 

When questioned on what occurred on June 7, 2177AD, at 12:00am, SCP-6281 replies __I’M SORRY: I DON’T HAVE THAT INFORMATION__, another difference from the error message. Taking these differences into account has led researchers to conclude with reasonable certainty that “__ERROR: TIME DOES NOT EXIST__”  indicates the advent of a ZK-CLASS end of reality scenario, which has been designated SCP-6281-Z.

Despite rigorous questioning, no events extraneous to the proceedings of the time have been found which might indicate a source for a ZK-CLASS scenario. The status of all known entities capable of a ZK-CLASS scenario was asked on that date, and no imminent containment breaches were found which might account for SCP-6281-Z.

A designation of seven personnel selected by the O5 council has been authorized to continue the investigation into SCP-6281-Z using SCP-6281. Should further information on the matter come to light, an addendum will be added.

= **&lt;Relevant Transcription of Council Meeting Held on 4/4/2022, 21:00 hours&gt;**

**O5-2:** It is proposed authorization be given to attempt opening of SCP-6281 and tampering with interior components for the purpose of preventing a reboot.

**O5-9:** The nature of SCP-6281 is still unknown to us. Tampering with it could have extreme consequences.

**O5-12:** Do you instead propose we do nothing and allow it to reboot?

**O5-9:** I would like to point out that we don’t know that SCP-6281-Z is indeed a ZK-CLASS scenario. It is possible that SCP-6281 reports that time does not exist past that date simply because its system clock reads that date as nonexistent.

**O5-12:** So you propose we gamble with the fate of reality?

**O5-5:** It is not the first time this council has had to take such a gamble. And let’s not pretend it wouldn’t most assuredly be a gamble to tamper with SCP-6281, one we don’t know the consequences of. We may only hasten SCP-6281-Z, if not something worse.

**O5-7:** If SCP-6281 is to be believed, it predates the creation of our solar system. I would like to remind everyone that SCP-6281 is capable of more than just changing history, it rewrites history so completely it’s beyond even an exclusionary site’s ability to detect; it is entirely possible the timeline is contingent on that server’s operation.

**O5-6:** That may be so, but we still don’t know what a “reboot” entails. It may merely be the beginning of a new clock cycle for the server, and 9 still be correct about a lack of a ZK-CLASS scenario. 

**O5-2:** If there are no further remarks, the matter of tampering with SCP-6281 will now be put to vote.

**O5-2:** The vote has failed with 9 against, 2 for, and 2 abstained. Investigation of SCP-6281-Z will continue, but no attempts at containment will be made at this time. The proposal will return to the table should further information come to light.

**O5-1:** On to the next matter of business.

**O5-2:** It is proposed that Dr. Rachel be reassigned from head of Preemptive Threat Assessment to the new position of Preemptive Threat Prevention, and given authorization to perform edits to future events using SCP-6281 in order to ensure the continued success of The Foundation. Should the vote pass, all edits must first be presented to the council and require a majority vote to be put into effect. In addition to this position, Dr. Rachel will join the investigation into SCP-6281-Z.

**O5-3:** Have we forgotten the incident with [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4011/offset/1 SCP-4011]?

**O5-10:** This is not a place for rhetorical questions, 3. It is because of SCP-4011 that we have taken the measures we already have.

**O5-5:** With the matter of SCP-4011 still unresolved, we are in need of a facility capable of replicating the effects of the Alpha-1 array.

**O5-3:** And we believe these additional measures will ensure there is not a repeat of SCP-4011?

**O5-1:** Use of any anomalous entities by The Foundation is heavily discouraged, however, the advantages presented here are too great to overlook. This council can learn from its past mistakes; SCP-6281 will only be used to alter events that threaten The Foundation yet to come. Even if we approve this, no edits will be made until presented and approved individually.

**O5-10:** Dr. Rachel has more than proven her capability to foresee threats to The Foundation. I am confident she will perform exemplary in both this new position and aiding in the investigation of SCP-6281-Z

**O5-2:** If there are no further remarks, the matter of utilizing SCP-6281 will now be put to vote.

**O5-2:** The vote has passed with 10 for, 3 against, 0 abstained. A notice will be sent to Dr. Rachel to report for her new assignment.

SCP-6281 continues to prove compatible with all access ports as additional models are developed. fifty-three of its one hundred and four ports have been identified.

To test this property of SCP-6281, and potentially gather more information on SCP-6281-Z, development of a new model of access cable was proposed by Dr. Rachel, and approved on October 4, 2059. The cable design would utilize a modified version of the same technology responsible for the containment breach at Site-14 in 2058. This model would allow examination of internal operating systems in addition to the option to override them. Such a cable would be incompatible with existing models of computer ports, but may account for a port on SCP-6281.

The cable was completed on September 21, 2066, and a compatible port was identified on SCP-6281, just as Dr. Rachel predicted. The cable was connected to SCP-6281 and the mainframe computer issued to Site-Eta, however, the mainframe continued to only display the standard welcome and search bar, without gaining any additional access to SCP-6281’s operating system.

This development was not deemed significant enough to merit a revote on containment protocol.

Seventy-nine of SCP-6281’s one hundred and four ports have been identified. Current projections of technological advancements, conducted by the quantum computer issued to Site-Eta, predict that all one hundred and four ports will be identified by the year 2177. 

This detail has been taken as confirmation of the threat of SCP-6281-Z by those in support of the existence of a ZK-CLASS scenario. Consequently; paranoia directed toward SCP-6281-Z has increased among personnel authorized to access SCP-6281. Disciplinary measures had to be taken in the case of Dr. Rachel, who attempted to consult organizations outside The Foundation on SCP-6281-Z without authorization. These communications were intercepted, and no information breach occurred. Dr. Rachel is currently receiving psychiatric counseling for her distress in place of more severe measures on account of her value to The Foundation.

This incident was following a new development in the investigation of SCP-6281-Z: 
As a continuation of The Vaticanation Proposal, Dr. Rachel was authorized to perform edits to the page containing Foundation records of SCP-6281. However, editing the page on SCP-6281 proved impossible. When selecting  __Edit__, a dialogue box appears, informing the user that __Administrator Permission is required to edit this page__.

In light of these developments, the matter of containing SCP-6281-Z returned to the O5 council for voting.

Following the vote, approval was given to attempt opening SCP-6281 to examine its components for avenues of containment, and efforts to identify an administrator have begun.

All one hundred and four ports on SCP-6281 have been identified.
The black casing comprising SCP-6281 has proved durable beyond expected projections. All traditional tools and anomalous efforts have failed to access the interior of SCP-6281. Pedolith displacement scans show the server extends thousands of miles into the ground. The scans cannot display past the molten layer, but it is speculated that SCP-6281 extends into the core of the Earth, making moving it or accessing its underside an impossibility.

Various personnel have been brought to Site-Eta to attempt to edit the page on SCP-6281, including O5 council members and various SCP entities that could be trusted to do so, but no administrator has been found.

**There: I wrote the report. Is anyone ever even going to read this!?**

**Who cares about protocol!? It’s going to be June 7th in 10 minutes and we don’t even know if there’s going to be a June 8th after SCP-6281 overflows!** 

**It was supposed to be Dr. Rachel’s job to update the records, but she took her own life an hour ago. Dr. Kiln found the body.**
 
**She once told me her position before this one was head of Preemptive Threat Assessment; it was her job to identify threats before they appeared. I saw how much this overflow was distressing her all these years, even though the council always said its threat assignment was undetermined, and now she’s killed herself before the overflow could happen. I can’t help but feel like maybe she was right.**

**If we all exist tomorrow for me to be disciplined for this report, I’ll gladly take whatever punishment they give me.**

In order to determine how successful our current and future efforts to obtain information on SCP-6281-Z will be, and in order to gain a greater span of time to apply this information, I propose authorization be given to inquire SCP-6281 on Foundation records pertaining to itself and SCP-6281-Z.
