**Item #:** SCP-CN-1256

**Object Class:** Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-CN-1256 is currently stored in an SCP Foundation Chinese Branch special anomalous-data server. The Network and Information Security Department is to constantly monitor this server to prevent information leakage. SCP-CN-1256 is only to be used to stabilize the situation when a Site under the Foundation&#39;s Chinese branch is experiencing an extremely large containment failure. Personnel who wish to test SCP-CN-1256 are to apply to the Site Director.

**Update ██/██/2016:** SCP-CN-1256 has been installed on all personal work computers located within Foundation sites. Personnel are encouraged to play SCP-CN-1256 in their spare time so as to strengthen the containment stability of the Foundation&#39;s Chinese branch.

##blue|**Update ██/██/2030:** SCP-CN-1256 has lost its anomalous effect. Following investigation, it has been reclassified Neutralized.##

**Description:** SCP-CN-1256 is a simulation PC game known as //SCP Foundation Chinese Branch Chronicle//, developed by ##blue|I&amp;I Entertainment Company, formerly Letters Entertainment&#39;s I&amp;I Studio## and running on all Windows versions from Windows XP onward##blue|, but does not support the Red Flag##[[footnote]]**Translator&#39;s note:** Refers to Red Flag Linux, a domestically-developed operating system used in China. This is likely a reference to the attitude within the Chinese government technology sector with regards to foreign software.[[/footnote]] ##blue|series of operating systems##. After the game is started, the screen will display the title &#34;SCP Foundation Chinese Branch Chronicle ---- The Chronicle of the Protectors&#34;.

The gameplay of SCP-CN-1256 consists of the following:

* The player takes the role of the site director of Containment Site XX (the identifier of the site can be chosen at will), and can delegate tasks to the rest of the Site. 
* The Site&#39;s main purpose is to capture and collect &#34;bugskips&#34;, arrange for researchers to deconstruct the features of the &#34;bugskips&#34;[[footnote]]displayed as a &#34;Anomalous Feature Gauge&#34;[[/footnote]] to obtain a large amount of testing data[[footnote]]while deconstructing, the &#34;bugskip&#34;&#39;s Anomalous Feature Gauge will decrease[[/footnote]], and placate humanoid &#34;bugskips&#34; [[footnote]]displayed as a &#34;Emotions Gauge&#34;[[/footnote]] to maintain containment. When a &#34;bugskip&#34;&#39;s Anomalous Feature Gauge reaches 0, it will be displayed as &#34;Explained&#34;.
* At the beginning of the game, the Site contains 2 containment chambers, 4 researchers and 10 &#34;lab rats&#34;; the tutorial will introduce the player to the mechanic of &#34;constructing containment chambers&#34;, &#34;hiring researchers&#34; and &#34;conscripting lab rats&#34; to replenish these resources.
* The main resource of the game is &#34;funds&#34;. &#34;Funds&#34; can be used to construct containment chambers, hire researchers and acquire more weapons that can be given to researchers. &#34;Funds&#34; are obtained by sending testing data to HQ or selling weapons created from testing data.
* &#34;Bugskips&#34; will cause a containment breach when their Emotions Gauge reaches 0 or the player contravenes the &#34;Containment Procedures&#34; in the game rules. At this point, researchers will use their weapons to suppress the breach or be killed in the breach. If suppression is unsuccessful, the &#34;bugskip&#34; will destroy the site or reach the Site Director&#39;s office, ending the game.
* The game claims that &#34;when all the bugskips are explained, the reward is a stable world&#34;; once this goal is complete, the game will proceed to either the Good Ending or the True Ending based on the player&#39;s performance. ##blue|The Good Ending and True Ending have been achieved; they detail a &#34;world in which bugskips are not produced, and humanity uses what were once bugskips to set out into the cosmos&#34;. The difference between the two is in whether the characters in the story survive.##

--SCP-CN-1256 is capable of autonomously installing downloadable content packs (DLCs) or updating itself, adding content corresponding to anomalies contained by the SCP Foundation&#39;s Chinese branch.--

--SCP-CN-1256&#39;s anomalous effect manifests when a person who works at or has a history of working at the Foundation&#39;s Chinese branch begins a new save file and plays the game, and will typically manifest in the form of the rates of testing failure, containment failure and Site-wide damage at the last Site the person worked at decreasing by █0% compared to the previous month. The player will also display a desire to continue/return to working at the Foundation; it is unknown whether this is an effect of the anomaly or a decision on the part of the player.--

##blue|**Update ██/██/2030:** After neutralization, all copies of SCP-CN-1256 repeatedly play the True Ending when run. It has been confirmed that SCP-CN-1256&#39;s neutralization is the source of the large-scale loss of anomalous effects, and facilitated a Fourth Industrial Revolution based on the information obtained from explained anomalies.##

**History:** SCP-CN-1256 was discovered on ██/██/2016 when it was published on Steam; shortly after discovery, it was taken down by Foundation effort. The next day, a Steam user by the name of &#34;Pumpkin NTW&#34; (PoI-12864) contacted the Foundation and claimed to be the developer of the anomaly; in the following two hours of conversation it was found that the Foundation and PoI-12864 shared a common objective, and PoI-12864 was brought into Foundation employment. For further information, see Addendum B: Interview Log CN1256-A.

##blue|However, in the following 14 years, no Foundation personnel have managed to complete the game; personnel have stated that the game is &#34;too hard, it&#39;s basically impossible to win&#34; and that &#34;just as the game is about to finish the system piles a bunch of new stuff on me&#34;. It was not until recently that PoI-12864&#39;s son (Dr. ███, PoI-25632) managed to complete the game over the course of a week. Following this, Dr. Ninth conducted an interview. For further information, see Addendum B: Interview Log CN1256-B.##

**Addendum B:** Interview Log CN1256-B
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewee:** PoI-25632
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr.Ninth
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;Begin Recording&gt;
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr.Ninth:** Congratulations. You are the first person in the entire Foundation to complete this game.
&gt;  
&gt; **PoI-25632:** Thank you, but I don&#39;t think I want to celebrate.
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr.Ninth:** Why is that?
&gt;  
&gt; **PoI-25632:** Because you only play this game to &#34;stabilize containment&#34;, not because you find it fun.
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr.Ninth:** But we have important work to do. We won&#39;t waste time playing a game just because it has mild reality-warping powers...
&gt;  
&gt; **PoI-25632:** No, my father already told you, didn&#39;t he? It&#39;s something you need to get done once and for all, but you didn&#39;t put two and two together! This game has reality-warping effects, but did you listen to what my father said? An ending without anomalies! Did you even consider it?
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr.Ninth:** Calm down, it&#39;s just a game.
&gt;  
&gt; **PoI-25632:** //Just// a game? Is this how you&#39;re treating the product of my father&#39;s work? Thanks to my father&#39;s last words, I joined the Foundation just to win this game!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr.Ninth:** Calm down. I just want to know, after completing this game, what exactly will happen?
&gt;  
&gt; **PoI-25632:** (Sighs) I&#39;m sorry about that. Based on the code my father wrote, once this game is completed, it will turn this world into a world devoid of the anomalous, just like the ending in the game.
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr.Ninth:** Your father didn&#39;t just write the non-anomalous parts of the code?
&gt;  
&gt; **PoI-25632:** No, all the code was written by him. My father was a reality-warper. He could have chosen to cause chaos as he wished, but he listened to Grandpa&#39;s teachings and chose to join the Foundation... But I, too, wish to continue his legacy.
&gt;  
&gt; **PoI-25632:** To be honest, you, too, are like that, following the teachings of that &#34;Administrator&#34; who disappeared long ago to the present day. But my father an I, we don&#39;t believe in the Foundation&#39;s way of dealing with anomalies. He always grieved for his father, always saying &#34;it&#39;d be better if nobody had to die like that&#34;... In the end... well, you know, my father, too, died serving the Foundation.
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr.Ninth:** I see. Now that you&#39;ve finished the game, what will you do?
&gt;  
&gt; **PoI-25632:** Quit my job. And you, too, can start packing up.
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr.Ninth:** Why&#39;s that?
&gt;  
&gt; **PoI-25632:** It&#39;s simple, isn&#39;t it? Is a Foundation [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/alive without anomalies] still the Foundation?

&gt; And so, this world became a world where the anomalous slowly waned.
&gt; Congratulations. You have finally reached a stable world.
&gt; And I have finally achieved the wish my father and I made: that there will no longer be any need to play that mourning song, composed from the blood of the pioneers.
&gt; May the flowers bloom.
