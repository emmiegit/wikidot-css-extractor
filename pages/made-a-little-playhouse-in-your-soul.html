Hello old friend,

It has been a long time since we last spoke. I, and the rest of the gang, miss you and hope you are doing well.

I’ve long since accepted that you didn’t need us anymore, even though we weren’t quite done with you yet, not even close, but I needed to reach out anyway. 

Do you remember how much fun we had together? How we had explored the world from top to bottom? Not your world, of course, but the one we made and saw together?

And do you remember how you left us? How you suddenly couldn’t see your friends for what we truly were? Well, I do. I remember it clearly. I remember how you looked at your collection of rocks and potion jars and felt nothing at all. How you just couldn’t see through the pile of cardboard to the castles that lay on the other side. And how you looked right through me as if I were nothing. But it’s okay, I understood.

Life moves on, although usually it takes more time. But you were falling behind in school and even I could see how worried your parents were for you. They just couldn’t see the magic like you could, like all grownups. Where you saw wonder and potential, they only saw problems and distractions. And, to them, the doctor was offering a miracle for their child’s future. So I don’t blame them either; none of us could have ever predicted it would only take a little pill to rip our worlds apart.

But through time, even as our lands lay barren, our voices mostly silenced, and our cities long forgotten, I want you to know that we still loved you. And in those moments when you longed for your days of childhood and looked to escape the stresses of life, we were here watching over you. We were always here for you and always will be.

But that’s not why I’m writing to you this time. No, this isn’t really about you. A younger dreamer has started to show up in our lands lately, and has given them new life. They’ve regaled stories of our own many adventures long since past, telling us that you still remember how much fun we had, and have started to take us on their own. But, we’ve heard you arguing lately about schoolwork too and it’s making us worried. 

So, this message is directly to you, our first dreamer, to let you know they are safe with us. We are happy together and so full of joy. So we ask, before you take that same leap your own parents did for you, let them have a few more adventures of their own. Let us fly just a little more. Let us explore and live free and see the world like only a child could until they are ready to move on. There will be time for work later. But now is a time to live.

Whatever you choose we trust you completely. It’s nice to talk to you again.

With love,
Teddy
