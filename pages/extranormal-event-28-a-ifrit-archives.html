**Foreword:** The following documentation is a collection of radio transmissions, recovered journal entries, and other relevant information pertaining to Extranormal Event (EE)-28-A, which took place during the United States&#39; War in Iraq. While no conclusive evidence has been found, research is underway, in collaboration with the United States&#39; Unusual Incidents Unit, to ascertain the validity of the events described, as well as confirm the existence of any anomalous entities that may exist in the area. To assist the reader, this information is presented in a roughly chronological order.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Show Official Report of EE-28-A&#34; hide=&#34;Collapse Report&#34;]]

&gt; On ██/██/████, fifteen men were dispatched to [REDACTED][[footnote]]As this information is primarily obtained from the UIU, certain locations have been redacted in the interest of security. In other portions, certain names have been changed.[[/footnote]], a small village in a remote part of Iraq, where a person of interest known to have ties to prominent terrorist groups was believed to be residing. Attempts to monitor the area via satellite were met with failure for unknown reasons, necessitating the dispatch of soldiers, who were to discreetly monitor the area in hopes of confirming the aforementioned reports.
&gt; 
&gt; Following failure to set up communications, as well as detection by a local, the team sent to this area retreated, hoping to return when a reliable method of communication was discovered. However, upon returning to the area, the village was found to have been almost totally destroyed, with an uncertain number of casualties and zero survivors. In the middle of the area, a large man-made(?) hole was discovered, apparently leading into an underground tunnel system. Some of the casualties were identified as known members of terrorist groups, and the current prevailing theory is that a black ops team from the armed forces of another country led a raid on the area. Due to the lack of information, no further investigation has been launched.

&gt; **Foreword:** Due to the heavy amount of static present throughout the audible transmissions, certain portions of this log were unable to be transcribed. This radio transmission took place approximately 3 hours into the mission, at which time Corporal Warren&#39;s team had just reached their destination. Corporal Warren then attempted to make contact with Lieutenant Dan Chambers (call-sign Oscar 2 Charlie), who was stationed at an outpost roughly twenty miles away, and was tasked with keeping up-to-date information on all active missions.
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; **Lt. Chambers:** Echo 4 Whiskey, Echo 4 Whiskey, this is Oscar 2 Charlie. Radio check. Over.
&gt; 
&gt; (Static.)
&gt; 
&gt; **Lt. Chambers:** Echo 4 Whiskey, do you copy?
&gt; 
&gt; **Cpl. Warren:** I read you, experiencing difficulties though. Over.
&gt; 
&gt; (Static.)
&gt; 
&gt; **Cpl. Warren:** Say again? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Lt. Chambers:** I repeat, do you have visual of the area of interest? Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **Cpl. Warren:** Affirmative. Over.
&gt; 
&gt; (Labored breathing can be heard, interlaced with heavy static.)
&gt; 
&gt; **Lt. Chambers:** Repeat?
&gt; 
&gt; (Static.)
&gt; 
&gt; **Lt. Chambers:** Echo 4 Whiskey, do you copy?
&gt; 
&gt; (There is a series of unidentified clicking noises, as well as unidentified low rumblings and tones.)
&gt; 
&gt; **Cpl. Warren:** Oscar 2 Charlie, say again?
&gt; 
&gt; (Static.)

[[collapsible show=&#34;Show Excerpts from the Journal of Corporal Warren&#34; hide=&#34;Collapse Journal Excerpts&#34;]]

**JUL 13, 20██:** Reached our destination roughly three hours ago, still haven&#39;t been able to make contact with Lt. Chambers for more than a few seconds at a time. Due to the communications interference in this area, three men, including myself, will be dispatched to try and make contact with our satcom. Current theory is that rocks in the area are magnetic to a certain degree, causing the static and difficulties in maintaining radio contact. 

On our way back, we accidentally caught the attention of an unknown individual wearing a white robe, who fled in the direction of the village after spotting us. In the interest of keeping this mission covert, we&#39;re leaving the area for the time being, until we have a reliable means of communication. 

**22:00** Back to the main area we&#39;ve been staying at, but men have reported seeing one or more unidentified figures on our way back, and even outside the village we&#39;re at now. Optics turned up nothing, not even any local wildlife or birds. Hallucinations seem like the most likely explanation. The power of suggestion is a funny thing. 

**JUL 14, 20██:** Daniels is missing. The last person who saw him said he went out for a leak, and fell asleep before he came back. None of his belongings were tampered with, with the exception of a large rock he had intended to take home as a souvenir. Everyone is on high alert right now, but we haven&#39;t found so much as a footprint. The men are all in a panic, talking about that same ghost or whatever it is they think they saw last night. 

[Our hired translator] said that the dogs might have seen something, they were barking up a storm this morning, and didn&#39;t want to go outside. He seemed a little panicked himself, and refused to help us look for Daniels. He wasn&#39;t sure of the word in English, but he seemed convinced that something called a &#39;shay a teen&#39; had done this. When he overheard one of the Privates talking about Daniels&#39; missing rock, he looked like he&#39;d seen a ghost.

The people living here are determined to kick us out, it would seem. Apparently we broke some sort of taboo by setting foot near the village we were supposed to observe. On that subject, heading for that village later today, with Lt. Olsen and his team as well. Chances are that&#39;s where Daniels is, if he&#39;s still alive.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Show Interview Log EE-28-A 01&#34; hide=&#34;Collapse Interview Log&#34;]]

&gt; **Foreword:** The following interview took place on ██/██/████, in an undisclosed location. Because this interview was conducted by the United States&#39; Unusual Incidents Unit, it should be noted that standard Foundation guidelines were not followed, and the interviewee has chosen to remain anonymous, referred to in the document as &#39;Charlie&#39;[[footnote]]However, Foundation agents have identified and located the individual, should further questioning and/or amnestic treatments be required.[[/footnote]].
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Agent Jennifer Howard, UIU
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewed:** ██████ ████ (Charlie)
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; (Extraneous data expunged.)
&gt; 
&gt; HOWARD: Very well, we can begin the interview now. Charlie, from what you have told us, during your recent deployment to [REDACTED], you believe you may have encountered something that was... out of the ordinary, to say the least?
&gt; 
&gt; CHARLIE: That is correct.
&gt; 
&gt; HOWARD: Alright, could you tell us about that? Start wherever you feel is most relevant, take as much time as you want.
&gt; 
&gt; CHARLIE: (There is a short pause.) Okay. The first time we saw it, I think, was when we were heading back to the camp we&#39;d been staying at, that was just outside a small village. Not the one that... you know, but another small village in the area. After the trek back to our cars, which were... A mile or two out? The sun was just about to go down, and we were all a bit paranoid, I&#39;ll admit, but I know I saw something in the distance, while we were walking. I couldn&#39;t make out the face or anything, but it looked like they were wearing white robes. I assumed it was the person that [other team members] had run into earlier, and I told Corporal Warren, but when we looked back, it was just... gone. And there weren&#39;t any large rocks or anything in the area where someone could have hidden. Well, except for all those weird looking rocks, but none of those were nearly big enough for a person to hide behind.
&gt; 
&gt; HOWARD: &#39;Weird looking rocks&#39;?
&gt; 
&gt; CHARLIE: Yeah, lots of oval shaped rocks, about a foot or so long. Daniels took one and brought it back with us, joked about taking it home as a souvenir for his daughter... We thought that those might be the magnetic rocks interfering with the signal, as we hadn&#39;t seen any like them before.
&gt; 
&gt; HOWARD: (There is a pause as Howard makes a note.) And this is the first time you saw it, you say? 
&gt; 
&gt; CHARLIE: That&#39;s right. The next time I saw it was while we were driving back. A few other guys were starting to say they saw it too, so of course we were all getting a little jumpy. Warren was getting a little annoyed with us, so he had two people watch either side of our vehicle with night optics. We were moving too fast to get a good look at anything in particular, but... I saw it again. It was closer, standing about 100 yards from the road. It just stood there, like it knew we would be passing by. It kind of- (Charlie mimics the motion he is describing.) -whipped its head towards me, I could see its face. It was staring right at me. Had these huge eyes, and its mouth was just hanging open. Other than moving its head, it was just totally still. Not even its clothes moved, and it was windy as hell. Gave me the fucking creeps.
&gt; 
&gt; HOWARD: You seem pretty sure about what you saw. Are you sure it&#39;s not possible you just saw some normal animal, and your mind filled in the rest? You did admit that the team as a whole was nervous and paranoid at the time. 
&gt; 
&gt; CHARLIE: (Shaking his head.) I don&#39;t think so. I mean, sure, it&#39;s possible. But I don&#39;t think so. It just stayed there while we passed, and I watched it until it was out of sight. I tried to tell Warren, but... he wasn&#39;t hearing it. Just said it was a wolf, or a jackal or something. He was always the most cautious guy we knew, none of us could believe it. Then again, he was probably just as scared as we were. (There is a short pause.) Other guys saw it. I could tell from the looks in their eyes. It was a long ride back.
&gt; 
&gt; HOWARD: You said that Corporal Warren was acting slightly out of the ordinary, how long did you notice this going on?
&gt; 
&gt; CHARLIE: Uh... I don&#39;t know, started right after he went with the team to make contact with the satcom I guess, before all of this went down. Why?
&gt; 
&gt; HOWARD: (Shuffling papers can be heard, followed by writing down notes.) Just curious. He was acting perfectly normal before he left?
&gt; 
&gt; CHARLIE: That&#39;s right. He just looked kind of out of it when he came back, like he&#39;d been hit in the head. [Another member of the team] said after they ran into someone outside the village, he went off alone for a minute. He said it was to make sure the satcom hadn&#39;t been tampered with. This was before his... well, you know all about it, I&#39;m sure.
&gt; 
&gt; HOWARD: We&#39;re aware. Please, continue.
&gt; 
&gt; CHARLIE: Alright... The next time I saw it was while we were back at our camp. We were all getting equipment unpacked, but it was way too quiet. It seemed like everyone in the village was staying in their houses, they brought all their animals inside, I didn&#39;t even see any bugs flying around. I went around the back of the car to pick up a box that had fallen, that&#39;s when I saw it again. It was still a long way off, and I had my optics on me, so I just watched it. It was moving sideways, like it was prowling around the perimeter of the village, just... watching us. I couldn&#39;t see its legs move, it was like it was floating. I got a better look at it this time, it had these weird long legs, like a grasshopper or something. And its arms were folded in this weird way. It moved over the rocks like they weren&#39;t even there. Then it just stopped, and stared right at me. The air around its back was shimmering, sort of like how a hummingbird or a bug flaps its wings too fast to make out. I was about ready to run for the camp, but some other guys were wondering where I went, and they came running. After a while, it just floated straight back, until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore. I tried to find it again with my optics, but it was gone.
&gt; 
&gt; HOWARD: And did you report this to Corporal Warren?
&gt; 
&gt; CHARLIE: Of course we did, we were spooked to shit. He just... shut us down after we told him we lost visual contact with it. Ordered us all to go in for the night. I don&#39;t think any of us slept. (Charlie shakes his head.) There was this low noise, like a loud humming. Like a giant fucking bee, right in your ear. And this smell too, they would come and go. Every time I heard or smelled it, I bolted up like I&#39;d been shocked. Had the worst headaches for days afterwards.
&gt; 
&gt; HOWARD: Can you describe this smell you mentioned?
&gt; 
&gt; CHARLIE: I don&#39;t know, it was... weird. It was like blood. Blood or... Like that smell when a bug gets burnt. It was awful. I heard footsteps outside once, and a few of us checked outside, but it was just Daniels. I guess that&#39;s when he... (Charlie does not continue.)
&gt; 
&gt; HOWARD: We really appreciate your cooperation. Is there anything else that you would like to add?
&gt; 
&gt; CHARLIE: (There is a pause.) Just the village, when we went back to it. There was something... wrong there. It wasn&#39;t like a military raid, the people there were just... torn to shreds. Most of the structures were okay, except for the rocks all over the place. Some of them were even lodged into the bodies. It was like something just came at them before they could react. Every second I was there, my brain was screaming at me to get out... That&#39;s probably why they wrapped up the investigation so quickly. Whatever it was that got Daniels... that&#39;s what did this. I just... feel it. And that weird hole in the middle, that&#39;s where it was the worst. The smell was all over the place... (Charlie does not continue.)
&gt; 
&gt; HOWARD: Thank you, Charlie. We&#39;re doing everything possible to make sure nothing like this happens again.

[[size 120%]] **UIU File 20██-02:** Codename &#34;Wendigo&#34;[[/size]]

----

* **Summary:** Suspect was briefly compromised by an unidentified extranormal agent. Currently undergoing therapy and psychological screening.

* **Name:** Cpl. Jacob Warren

* **Irregularity Cross-reference:** Human, Military, Psionic, Mind-Alteration

* **Capabilities:** //Waived, reason: (&#34;Currently no extranormal traits.&#34;)//

* **Behavior:** Was, for an unknown period of time, compromised by an unidentified psionic(?) force. Suspect reported that the last thing he remembered before being compromised was hearing a high-frequency noise, and experiencing severe headaches, before encountering an unidentified entity. During this time, suspect exhibited unusual behavior, including subdued reactions to potentially dangerous circumstances. Following this, suspect attempted to disturb evidence on the scene of an unidentified incident, causing the death of numerous individuals. Suspect was reportedly caught trying to break or smash multiple ovular rocks found on the scene. Suspect became violent after being questioned as to this behavior, and was forcibly restrained when he was non responsive. Four soldiers were injured in trying to restrain the suspect, and were forced to render him unconscious to pacify him. 

* **Current Status:** As the suspect has exhibited no psychological or extranormal abnormalities since the incident leading to his detainment, with the exclusion of chronic migraines for short periods of time, the suspect is undergoing psychological treatment, and is expected to be released to the public within the month. Suspect has been placed on leave from his military duties for the time being.

&gt; **Lt. Chambers:** Oscar 2 Oscar, this is Oscar 2 Charlie. Do you read me? Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lt. Olsen:** Copy loud and clear. Do you read me on your end? Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lt. Chambers:** I read you. The signal interference seems to have cleared up for the time being. Oscar 2 Oscar, are you aware of any way the bodies in this area could have been... disturbed? Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lt. Olsen:** Negative, we did a quick check and left the scene. What seems to be the issue? Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lt. Chambers:** One of my men pointed something out to me that is a little unusual, we&#39;re doing a flyover right now, and it seems that all the remains are missing, as are the rocks that Warren was messing with. Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lt. Olsen:** Oh, well that&#39;s odd. My team didn&#39;t touch &#39;em. After Warren had his... episode, we left to get him medical attention. Over. 
&gt; 
&gt; (There is a brief pause.) 
&gt; 
&gt; **Lt. Olsen:** Oscar 2 Charlie, do you read me?
&gt; 
&gt; **Lt. Chambers:** Yes, I read you, sorry about that, one of my men thought they spotted something down there in the hole. Turned out to be nothing. We&#39;ll be heading back to your position shortly. Over and out.
