Item #: SCP-7424 A

Object Class: Keter

**Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7424 A’s ability to teleport through shadows has resulted in its cell being equipped with 6000+ lumen lights or above, failure to comply will result in SCP-7424 A escaping the facility.
Its cell is lined with three inches of lead and is accommodated with the basic amenities, and no windows (underground), SCP- 7424 A is rewarded with music every two months for twenty minutes if no escape attempts have been recorded.
Direct contact with SCP-7424 A is forbidden without it being heavily dosed with sedation, failure to comply is likely to result in death of the interviewer and any guards in the area. SCP-7424 A is to be escorted with a minimum of two guards.
SCP-7424 A doesn’t need food, water, nor sleep though it will often lay down anyways and daydream though it’s not to be mistaken to be asleep.
Security codes have to be changed every three days as SCP-7424 A’s hearing is exceptionally good and escape attempts have been made.
SCP-7424 A is to be denied any information about any other SCPs at all times, it’s unknown what it wants with the information but it should be denied at all times, even as simple as their names.

Description: It seems to maintain the appearance of a teenage girl (17-19 years old based on X-Rays) with the exception of cat-like eyes and lengthened nails about four inches past its fingertips with the density and strength of an unknown, possibly unbreakable material, which it uses as its main killing weapon.
SCP-7424 A aims for vital organs, particularly the throat and stomach, its proved to enjoy toying with its victims even if its at an disadvantage and draws great pleasure from harming others (even its fellow SCP; particularly SCP 106).
After some extensive testing, it’s been proven that SCP-7424 A has impressive regeneration abilities with the exception of lead which is known to slow down the healing process as well as inhuman strength, bending steel with minimal effort, and impressive reaction times, allowing it to catch a bullet if it desired.

Addendum: SCP-7424 A was found terrorizing hikers in rural Silverton, Colorado by kidnapping people, mainly older teenagers and young adults (no gender preference noted) right off the trails and torturing them to death for two purposes “for fun” or “to become its friends”.
However, those it deems its ‘friends’ are tied to trees in a sort of pocket plane which has proven extremely difficult to find (as anyone who wanders in the area forgets what they were doing) and either succumbed to malnourishment or their throats ripped out by SCP-7424 A after it grows bored.
SCP-7424 A has claimed it was Human at once, it’s name was [REDACTED], however we’ve been unable to find any existing records.
Psychiatrist, Dr. [REDACTED] interviewed SCP-7424 A on [REDACTED] and was able to come to the conclusion that it doesn’t feel remorse for its actions, nor does it plan to in the future. He also came to the conclusion that SCP-7424 A possessed a serious mental illness that was probably an side-effect of its condition though he couldn’t properly identify it yet, requesting a follow up interview.
SCP-7424 A has had multiple escape attempts, [REDACTED] were successful, security measures have been updated.
We’ve located its counterpart, SCP-7424 B but capturing it has been unsuccessful and proven much more dangerous than expected- [REDACTED].

- It’s unknown how old SCP-7424 A actually is, we have nothing to go on besides it referencing 1903 being a “wild” year (though it’s possible it’s trying to confuse us).
- SCP-7424 A was captured wearing torn jeans, a green hoodie and military boots, they were confiscated upon entry to the facility, it’s suspected that it took its clothes from hikers.
- SCP-7424 A died from hyperthermia in Silverton, Colorado and was resurrected by SCP-7424 B.
- Even though it claims to be younger than SCP-7424 B; it’s known as SCP-7424 A because her existence was confirmed first.
- SCP-7424 A is responsible for over 173 known kidnapping and murders in Silverton, Colorado in the past 20 years.
- SCP-7424 A doesn’t mind being called “it” or “they” but it also goes by “she”.
- SCP-7424 A is sensitive to the cold, it can be used as a temporary stunning device to assist in containment.
- Despite commonly being seen as mindlessly insane, it has shown great levels of intelligence during its hunts and escape attempts.[http://www.example.com describe link]</textarea></pre>
