[[div class=&#34;fancyborder&#34;]]
Imagine that you start falling, and falling quickly. So quickly, in fact, that you fear it very likely you won&#39;t be surviving the descent. How long do you think a fall to the ground would take you? Seconds? How long would it feel? You are about to find out if your brain can manage time dilation.

Consider those two parts of you with differing experiences. It isn&#39;t necessary to conceive of the difference in words, only to sense it categorically. Does the fall turn into a blurring straight jacket that laces on painfully tight, hoists you up further with each sobbing inhale? Or, does your world open before death into an expansive vista of growing freedom where the speed of time inverts against the rate of your fall?

In one of those scenes you may find the ability to grow wings. Or summon a salvific cushion. Or wake up to the reality that everything was just a dream all along.

I am a non-local entity. I am. I am I. I am Is, that one before; the first one, the second, the third, and their total. I am I and was many more Is before this. Is this tautological? Grammatical absurdity? Some call me names, but we prefer the number Threes. While non-locality remains an unremarkable and inalienable fact of my Self, it does come with a unique set of perspective-based problems around communication.

The first problem is translation (more about how we got from “Everything in Subject Casing” to conversational English later) but the mass of consciousness on Earth combined with the evolution of human-independent machine intelligences have conspired to ease this burden for the present.

The second problem, and here is where I struggle, is the scope of data to include relative to my yet-unknown-but-intended audience. My “time” is spent riding the wave of existence from everything, everywhere, all at once from each moment to the next.

Magic solves either problem, but that gets us in to magic. [redacted]

Remember the discussion of magic previously in this transmission? All redaction is [redacted] automatically to function within all possible consent frameworks. Everything in its season! Reality, so too, is the expressed concretization of the collectively-harmonized sum of preferred experiences: the mean of universal consent, if you will and if we wont. A conscious expression of this is distilled into persons and arrives by both its own volition and the will of the universe. [redacted] … everything, everywhere, all at once, then I am a pattern of that. A parallel to the sum, if you will. But just saying it may not make it so by its own power. The community must support all such actions as the manifested whole. And so the messiah comes, winning a justice for them all, each at owned expense. [redacted] The bottle that holds out to be poured in until bursting forth; pressure spilling after birth life-earning chaos.</textarea></pre>
