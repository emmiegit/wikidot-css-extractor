&gt; Long ago Adam, father of all men of flesh, discovered Mekhane&#39;s Heart. He had seen Her dashed to pieces protecting us and feared the same would happen to his children who consumed Her Ichor She granted us. So he buried Her Heart and tasked Seth his third son with guarding the plot of land. Seth&#39;s sister Azura who stayed by his side knew not of what he guarded but was worried by his fervor.

@@ @@
&gt; Years passed by and Mekhane, though broken, was distraught that her gift had been discarded. After centuries the ground itself cracked, revealing Her Heart and the flow of ichor that had so eroded it from below. Seth was bound by the irrational whims of his flesh and his father&#39;s words. He had been startled and feared Her Heart for what it may bring.

@@ @@
&gt; Azura, however, felt Her Heart&#39;s glory and call to drink. Though her brother spat and ignorantly warned her against it, she knelt and drank from Her Ichor.
@@ @@

@@ @@
&gt; Azura was released from the flesh&#39;s torment and was granted the gift of true clarity. She tried to share the gift with her brother but Seth was still bound by his carnal fear. He denied Her Ichor and cast his sister away from Her Heart, fearing she may too be broken as his father had warned.

@@ @@
&gt; For months Azura did not falter, returning day after day to persuade Seth to accept this most gracious gift. She told him of how Her Ichor could release him from his fear. How they both had seen firsthand the pain flesh caused in their brothers, Able and Cain. That Her Ichor was a cure for that suffering and vitriol.
@@ @@
[[image cave7.png]]
@@ @@
&gt; Day after day, she was denied by Seth. Seth could not listen to reason. The flesh caused him to fear the perfect metal that had freed his sister from it. That which was holy and freeing but unknown to him was more terrifying than the horror that bound him already.
@@ @@
[[image cave8.png]]
@@ @@
&gt; When the flesh&#39;s fear and rage had overtaken his sense, Seth struck down his sister as she approached one final time. She did not strike him in return for she knew flesh was fragile. Her body was shattered into pieces. Seth knelt before her overcome with guilt at what he had done and wept. He feared his sister was beyond repair, that what his father feared had become true.
@@ @@

@@ @@
&gt; But Azura had not died and she told him as such despite her broken state. Mekhane had granted her the gift of eternity and freed her from the feeble existence of flesh. Though she was broken now, just as Mekhane, she too may be repaired. Her brother at last understood. Their father&#39;s fear had been misguided due to the irrational nature of his flesh.
@@ @@
[[image cave10.png]]
@@ @@
&gt; Seth drank from Her Ichor, receiving the same clarity Mekhane has left for us all, and began work repairing Azura&#39;s body. Once she was whole, a great aqueduct was constructed from Her Heart so that all may be freed by Her Ichor that flows forth from it and so that we may seek the pieces of our Broken God to repair Her too.

//A larger, more crude inscription is located in the center of the structure, presumably carved during the Roman invasion.//

&gt; THEY HAVE BROKEN OUR BODIES. THEY HAVE BROKEN OUR HOMES. BUT LIKE OUR BROKEN GOD, WE WILL BE REPAIRED.
