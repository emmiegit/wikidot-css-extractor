**Item #:** SCP-3614

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the immovable nature of SCP-3614-1, it is to remain at its site of discovery. Containment teams have established a 4 km perimeter around SCP-3614-1; civilian traffic is to be rerouted under the guise of a cover story alleging military operations in the area.

Area-31Ω has been established around SCP-3614-1 to carry out exploration of SCP-3614-Prime. Only D-class may enter SCP-3614-Prime with Level 4/3614 permissions.

SCP-3614-2 is to be kept in a standard low-security containment locker. Testing on SCP-3614-2 and access to the information contained within can only be done with Level 5/3614 approval.

The Overseer Council is investigating the credibility of Document 3614-B, which was recovered from SCP-3614-2 upon its discovery on 2/27/2019. In addition, the Foundation is attempting communication with SCP-3614-Prime to gain more information regarding potential anomalous influences on consensus reality. However, current temporal models, namely the Ogundimu-Zhang hypothesis, estimate chances of success to be low: approximately 1 out of 10 ✕ 10^^100^^.

**Description:** SCP-3614 designates a set of three extra-temporal anomalies.

SCP-3614-1 is a conic area of space in Toole County, Utah, United States. The anomaly is approximately 500 meters in height and 2 meters in width at its base, tapering towards its top. SCP-3614-1 appears as a distinct visual distortion of the surrounding area, taking on a prominent crystalline-like appearance and texture. SCP-3614-1 has been reported by on-site personnel to emit a high-pitched noise akin to that of wind blowing.

All matter that enters SCP-3614-1 will be transported to a space-time anomaly designated SCP-3614-Prime. The SCP-3614-Prime anomaly appears effectively identical to Earth; however, numerous aspects of it are inconsistent with those in the baseline reality, as documented below. It is unknown if these deviations extend beyond the SCP-3614-Prime version of Earth, or if they are confined to the planet.

SCP-3614-1 was unintentionally created during preliminary tests of Project BLACK CREVASSE, a Foundation initiative headed by O5-1 and O5-13. Following the discovery of SCP-3614-Prime and failure of initial experiments, O5-1 discontinued BLACK CREVASSE on 6/21/2018. Further information is in Document 3614-A: BLACK CREVASSE Project Brief.

SCP-3614-2 is an ellipsoidal metallic capsule originating from SCP-3614-Prime. Dimensions are approximately 1.3 by 2.8 meters. Analysis has revealed that SCP-3614-2 is comprised of non-anomalous steel along with several other substances unknown to modern science. Further examination of SCP-3614-2 has revealed that it contains an electronic terminal interface similar to those used by the Foundation, from which Document 3614-B was recovered.

SCP-3614-2 was first seen emerging from the top end of SCP-3614-1 on 2/27/2019. Full emergence from SCP-3614-1 took 3 minutes and 21 seconds. After emergence, SCP-3614-2 traveled 264 meters due west via an unknown means of propulsion and crash-landed in the nearby desert. To date, this is the only observed occurrence of contact from SCP-3614-Prime.

Investigation of recovered materials from SCP-3614-Prime has revealed that it exhibits the following critical divergences from baseline reality:

* Advanced technology beyond the capabilities of currently understood science

* Different socio-cultural trends throughout history, including increased globalization in the 20th century and overall reduced rates of nationalism, isolationism, etc.

* The non-existence or otherwise historical displacement of numerous events and time periods of the prime timeline (see Addendum 3614-1)

* The SCP Foundation revealing its existence to the public in the early 21st century, acting as a global agency with significant influence in the governments of all world powers

* Most notably, the absence of all sapient life within SCP-3614-Prime

**Addendum 3614-2:** Selected Correspondence

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ ACCESS files://3614/main/correspondences.pdf&#34; hide=&#34;- ACCESS GRANTED&#34;]]

The following is a collection of archived correspondence between Dr. Liu Zhang and Dr. Adebiyi Ogundimu, Project Co-leads on SCP-3614.

&gt; **DATE:** 1/16/2019
&gt; **TO:** Dr. Liu Zhang &lt;{{lzhang@scp.int}}&gt;
&gt; **FROM:** Dr. Adebiyi Ogundimu &lt;{{aogundimu@scp.int}}&gt;
&gt; **SUBJECT:** Prelim. observations
&gt; 
&gt; Preliminary explorations have been completed. I can safely say there&#39;s no sign of sentient life in 3614-Prime. Looks like we&#39;re dealing with another &#34;crapsack&#34; world, if you mind the informal language. Nothing unique.

&gt; **DATE:** 1/16/2019
&gt; **TO:** Dr. Adebiyi Ogundimu &lt;{{aogundimu@scp.int}}&gt;
&gt; **FROM:** Dr. Liu Zhang &lt;{{lzhang@scp.int}}&gt;
&gt; **SUBJECT:** RE: Prelim. observations
&gt; 
&gt; Your observations have been noted. I think we can agree that we should designate SCP-3614 as a low-priority assignment for the time being. We have more important issues on our hands. 

&gt; **DATE:** 1/20/2019
&gt; **TO:** Dr. Liu Zhang &lt;{{lzhang@scp.int}}&gt;
&gt; **FROM:** Dr. Adebiyi Ogundimu &lt;{{aogundimu@scp.int}}&gt;
&gt; **SUBJECT:** Further observations
&gt; 
&gt; My team and I have been conducting further explorations into 3614-Prime. I&#39;m well aware that you have designated it as low-priority, but I still think you will find this interesting.
&gt; 
&gt; From what we can determine, the basic laws of science still apply inside there. Hume levels are practically normal. So we can rule out Prime being a parallel/pocket dimension. This is a full-on alternate timeline we&#39;re dealing with here, Level I on the Tegmark scale. Given the condition of Prime, this raises an important question: how did it become the way it is? 

&gt; **DATE:** 1/25/2019
&gt; **TO:** Dr. Liu Zhang &lt;{{lzhang@scp.int}}&gt;
&gt; **FROM:** Dr. Adebiyi Ogundimu &lt;{{aogundimu@scp.int}}&gt;
&gt; **SUBJECT:** New findings
&gt; 
&gt; We&#39;ve figured out what the facility on the other side of 3614-1 is. It&#39;s a Foundation site.
&gt; 
&gt; Specifically, Site-82. For whatever reason, they finished construction over there. This opens a whole new realm of information we can glean from Prime. If they&#39;ve built Site-82, then that means they probably gave BLACK CREVASSE the green light too. God knows what happened after that.
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#39;t know how much you know, but I was never really briefed on BLACK CREVASSE back when it was a thing. This was in spite of the fact that the hypothesis the O5 Council decided to source for their uses is partly named after me. Personally, I would have appreciated being let in on it a little more.
&gt; 
&gt; I digress. We need to investigate this further.

&gt; **DATE:** 1/26/2019
&gt; **TO:** Dr. Adebiyi Ogundimu &lt;{{aogundimu@scp.int}}&gt;
&gt; **FROM:** Dr. Liu Zhang &lt;{{lzhang@scp.int}}&gt;
&gt; **SUBJECT:** RE: New findings
&gt; 
&gt; Believe me, there was really nothing //to// know about. BLACK CREVASSE was nothing more than a set of ideas, only in the realm of the hypothetical. Looking back, it was never meant to be. At least, in our world.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe we could learn more about what could have been. Report on what you find there.

&gt; **DATE:** 2/14/2019
&gt; **TO:** Dr. Liu Zhang &lt;{{lzhang@scp.int}}&gt;
&gt; **FROM:** Dr. Adebiyi Ogundimu &lt;{{aogundimu@scp.int}}&gt;
&gt; **SUBJECT:** RE: RE: New findings
&gt; 
&gt; We&#39;ve found information regarding BLACK CREVASSE in Site-82 from archived server data. It&#39;s confirmed my suspicions; it seems like they&#39;ve moved forward with it over there. The most recent legible document we could find details the cessation of preliminary testing. But after that, it just stops. 
&gt; 
&gt; That&#39;s not the whole story, though.
&gt; 
&gt; We&#39;ve found other documents on another Foundation project called LIGHT EMPATH. They&#39;re highly corrupted, but from what we can gather, LIGHT EMPATH was put into operation as soon as BLACK CREVASSE ended. What we can decipher is... intriguing. The temporal models it presents are incredibly complex, far beyond anything we have developed. From our point of view, it seems like madness. But from theirs... maybe it&#39;s something else entirely.

&gt; **DATE:** 2/17/2019
&gt; **TO:** Dr. Liu Zhang &lt;{{lzhang@scp.int}}&gt;
&gt; **FROM:** Dr. Adebiyi Ogundimu &lt;{{aogundimu@scp.int}}&gt;
&gt; **SUBJECT:** Something strange
&gt; 
&gt; Things don&#39;t quite make sense.
&gt; 
&gt; In all other documents we&#39;ve recovered so far, there&#39;s nothing that could explain what happened to Prime. No distress signals, no containment breaches, nothing. It&#39;s like Site-82 is frozen in time. Something about this doesn&#39;t feel right.
&gt; 
&gt; I propose postponing all exploration of Prime until further notice.

&gt; **DATE:** 2/25/2019
&gt; **TO:** Dr. Liu Zhang &lt;{{lzhang@scp.int}}&gt;
&gt; **FROM:** Dr. Adebiyi Ogundimu &lt;{{aogundimu@scp.int}}&gt;
&gt; **SUBJECT:** A thought
&gt; 
&gt; Last night, I had a nightmare.
&gt; 
&gt; It was the kind that you don&#39;t remember. The kind in which all the fear, so clear and present just heartbeats ago, vanishes as soon as you open your eyes. Whatever it was, it got me thinking. And the first thing my racing brain thought of, as I lied in bed covered in sweat, was the same thing I&#39;ve been thinking of almost constantly for the past few weeks.
&gt; 
&gt; 3614-Prime is a dead world. Never in any of our explorations have we seen anything even resembling any form of life. Yet all the information is still there. Books. Maps. Even the Internet still works in there. And never have we ever discovered a single piece of information that gave any background to how it became this way.
&gt; 
&gt; Something doesn&#39;t quite add up.
&gt; 
&gt; I lied in bed, ruminating on this for hours. Then I realized something. 
&gt; 
&gt; I think we&#39;ve been peering through the looking glass so much that we&#39;ve gotten tunnel vision.
&gt; 
&gt; 3614-1 is a one-way window to another world. Another timeline, a different history, where all sapient life is dead. That is what it looks like from our side.
&gt; 
&gt; What if we&#39;ve been looking through from the wrong side?

&gt; **DATE:** 2/26/2019
&gt; **TO:** Dr. Liu Zhang &lt;{{lzhang@scp.int}}&gt;
&gt; **FROM:** Dr. Adebiyi Ogundimu &lt;{{aogundimu@scp.int}}&gt;
&gt; **SUBJECT:** I know now.
&gt; 
&gt; We aren&#39;t looking at them.
&gt; 
&gt; They&#39;re looking at us.

**Project Codename:** BLACK CREVASSE

**Project #:** BC-41117632

**Project Aim:** To create a convenient means of travel to and from determinative sets outside of normal temporal progression as understood by conventional science. 

**Project Leads:** O5-1, O5-13

**Attached Notice from O5-1:** The Overseer Council has deemed it necessary to formulate a secondary contingency plan for potential world-ending threats when the use of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2000 SCP-2000] is impossible. Considering the recent hypothesis proposed by Dr. Adebiyi Ogundimu and Dr. Liu Zhang, the Overseer Council has created a viable proposal.

Over the course of the past twenty years, the number of Red- and Black-level threats has increased by an estimate of █ - ██%. This, coupled with, the overall increase of anomalies discovered by the Foundation, has created a significant threat to consensus reality. 

We must not rely on lesser failsafes to ensure the continuity of consensus reality. Instead, we must take a proactive hand in changing it. If achieved, Project BLACK CREVASSE will provide us with a true reset button. While SCP-2000 sows the seeds of a new beginning on a scorched earth, BLACK CREVASSE will ensure that such an earth will never exist.

Most work on BLACK CREVASSE will take place in the future Site-82 after it has finished construction. Monitor your local communication channels for further information.

**OFFICIAL NOTICE FROM OVERSEER COUNCIL 6/21/2018:** Following development of preliminary models, further construction of Site-82 and all activity regarding Project BLACK CREVASSE are to be suspended indefinitely.

The following information was recovered from the electronic interface found on SCP-3614-2. 

**DISCLAIMER:** The following document is subject to an extensive investigation by the O5 Council to determine the credibility of its contents. The following information is not verified as truthful and may be misleading or completely false.

**scp-001.pdf**

&gt; **Item #:** SCP-001
&gt;  
&gt; **Object Class:** Apollyon
&gt; 
&gt; **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-001 is currently uncontainable. Contact with SCP-001 must be avoided, with the exception of Project LIGHT EMPATH Initiative 14-Phi-B. All attempts of contact from SCP-001 are to be ignored. More information to follow. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Project LIGHT EMPATH Initiative 14-Phi-B:** The contents of this file, along with Document 001-8672A, are to be sent to SCP-001 via Project LIGHT EMPATH to establish one-way communication with SCP-001. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** SCP-001 is a determinative set. Divergence from the prime timeline is hypothesized to have occurred within 10 years of 3000 BCE. Project LIGHT EMPATH has revealed that SCP-001 is under the influence of numerous anomalous social, economic, and cultural trends that have not been observed in any other determinative set. It is hypothesized this is due to a hostile entity or phenomenon currently exerting control over the inhabitants of SCP-001. The effects of SCP-001 are currently spreading throughout all other determinative sets at an unknown rate. The vector of infection is unknown.
&gt; 
&gt; Refer to Document 001-8672A for more details.

&gt; 
&gt; To the O5 Council,
&gt; 
&gt; Fear dominates your lives.
&gt; 
&gt; The nature of your reality instills its most primal forms you as you deal with the horrors you contain, going to sleep every night knowing that it might be your final night on Earth. You pursued what you call Project BLACK CREVASSE to escape this constant fear, yet it was not meant to be. Your attempts at finding a better reality, free of the horrors you must deal with on a daily basis, were all met with failure. We know why they failed. In this document, we will tell you why.
&gt; 
&gt; Five years ago, we launched Project LIGHT EMPATH: an attempt to catalog as many determinative sets, as a contingency plan if something went irreversibly wrong in ours. It was born out of Project BLACK CREVASSE; without it, we would not have sufficiently advanced technology to carry out such a monumental task. LIGHT EMPATH had cataloged 10^^100^^ different timelines before you reached out with BLACK CREVASSE. What we discovered scared us.
&gt; 
&gt; Out of 10^^100^^ determinative sets, 10^^100^^ possible realities that could blossom forth from the seeds of time, your reality was different. Your technology was thousands of years behind even the most primitive timeline we had encountered up to that point. The horrors you hear of every day, be it war, disease, or famine, while still present in ours, are rampant in yours. They are anomalies of your world.
&gt; 
&gt; You are living in a dystopia worse than any of us could have ever dreamed of.
&gt; 
&gt; What we are about to say will upset you, but we must tell you. We at least owe you that much. When we discovered you, our first instinct was not to save you. It was not to help you reach your true potential. It was not to reach a helping hand out, to pull you out of this dark pit you live in.
&gt; 
&gt; It was to run.
&gt; 
&gt; We couldn&#39;t run. So we hid. LIGHT EMPATH sealed our reality off, made your attempts at finding us show you an empty world that is a mere afterimage of ours devoid of any sign of humanity. We deliberately made it impossible for you to find us or contact us. BLACK CREVASSE was not a failure. In fact, it was too successful for its own good. Your failed efforts at finding a beacon of hope, a light cutting through the bleakness of the abyss, are not because there is nothing out there. 
&gt; 
&gt; They failed because we willed it not to be. 
&gt; 
&gt; Our world at large has been living in an unprecedented era of peace and technological advancement for the last two centuries. Meanwhile, yours has undergone the same cycle of trying to build a better future, only to give way to strife and chaos again and again. You are destined never to make any real progress. While we live in the safety of our houses, look upon our fellow citizens and smile at them with trust and care, we can only say this to you, our fallen brethren:
&gt; 
&gt; We&#39;re so sorry.
&gt; 
&gt; Secure. Contain. Protect.
