**Item #:** SCP-042-J

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- --Neutralized-- Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the nature of the phenomenon, SCP-042-J cannot be contained, but an ongoing effort by Foundation field agents to destroy every pillow on Earth has been --very effective-- useless in curbing the phenomenon.

**Description:** SCP-042-J is a visual spacetime anomaly observed in 100% of tested pillows, regardless of the method or time of construction. Test subjects with only one eye appear to be immune to its effects.

The anomaly occurs when a test subject lays their head on a pillow and closes one eye, then switches eyes. SCP-042-J appears to teleport the pillow to a slightly different location relative to the previously observed position. To an outside observer, the pillow does not appear to move at all, an obvious indication of psychic projection by --the pillow-- something. A slight &#34;crossing&#34; of the eyes makes it apparent that the pillow exists in two points in spacetime simultaneously; how it does this is --creepy as hell-- unknown.

**Timeline:**

**4/24/1992:** Now-deceased comedian George Carlin references the anomaly at a show at the Paramount Theater in New York. It is unknown how Carlin initially discovered the anomaly. A transcript follows:

&gt; Like when you have your head on a pillow… did you ever notice when you have your head on a pillow, if you close the bottom eye, the pillow is down there, then if you switch eyes, the pillow moves up there? &#34;Whoa, holy shit Dave! Look at this! The mystery of the moving pillow…&#34;

**11/10/1992:** Carlin&#39;s show from April 24th is released on HBO, titled //Jammin&#39; in New York//. The anomaly instantly begins to manifest itself across the United States. Dr. █████ theorizes that Carlin is &#34;a host spreading the parasite, or an alien or some shit.&#34;

**11/11/1992:** Mobile Task Force Pi-1 (&#34;City Slickers&#34;) is deployed and Carlin is apprehended and brought to Site-28 for interrogation. Carlin was highly uncooperative and was released after autographing Dr. █████&#39;s lab coat and receiving a Class-C amnesiac.

**11/14/1992:** SCP status assigned after Dr. █████ spent a full night observing the anomaly. Research on SCP-042-J begins in earnest.

**11/15/1992:** Seventeen (17) D-Class personnel were used as test subjects. All subjects confirmed that they saw the phenomenon, with the most common response being that SCP-042-J was &#34;weird as shit.&#34;

**11/17/1992:** Dr. █████ resigns citing not having been able to sleep since the phenomenon was first detected. Dr. ███ takes over as project head.

**11/18/1992:** D-33023 is apparently immune to the effects of SCP-042-J, by way of having lost an eye while performing [REDACTED]. Further investigation using D-33023 is approved.

//Ewwww, how did he even..? -Dr. ███//

**11/20/1992:** It is decided by Dr. █████ that between the fact that all pillows seem to exhibit this anomaly and the sheer number of pillows on Earth, SCP-042-J has a high likelihood of being malicious, and a pre-emptive plan of attack is necessary. Requesting reclassification to Keter.

//Denied. -O5-█//

**11/21/1992:** Requesting parameter modification to Euclid-D to better protect the populace.

//Approved. Destroy, destroy, destroy. God help us all. -O5-█// 

**11/22/1992:** Given the success of testing with D-33023, Mobile Task Force Kappa-7 (&#34;Hammurabi&#39;s Lawyers&#34;) has been created with the assignment to remove an eye from every person on the planet.

//I can&#39;t believe we didn&#39;t think of this sooner. -Dr. ███//

**11/23/1992:** Dr. ███ has been demoted and MTF Kappa-7 disbanded.

//Who the hell promoted this man? He&#39;s not even a real doctor. -O5-█//

**11/24/1992:** Dr. ███████ replaces Dr. ███ effective immediately.

**11/26/1992:** It is determined that all pillows in the New York City metropolitan area have been affected by SCP-042-J. Mobile Task Force Kappa-8 (&#34;No Sleep Till Brooklyn&#34;) has been created with the assignment of neutralizing every pillow in New York City.

//Why did Dr. ███ want to cut out all the eyeballs? It&#39;s much cheaper and less painful to destroy all the pillows. - Dr. ███████//

**12/3/1992:** Increased budget requested for MTF Kappa-8. Projections show it will take over 700 years to neutralize every pillow in New York at this rate.

//Approved. –O5-█//

**3/7/1993:** Due to the greatly increased budget and access to [[[SCP-1543-J]]], neutralizing of New York City&#39;s pillows has been completed. Rioting subsided after the first few weeks of martial law. Dr. ███████ has met with Administrator █████ to discuss plans for North America and the world.

//When in doubt, launch into the sun. -O5-█//

**3/16/1993:** The SCP Foundation now stands for &#34;Secure, Contain, Pillows.&#34; MTF Kappa-8 has merged with MTF Omega-7 (&#34;Pandora&#39;s Box&#34;) to form Joint Task Force Zeta-1 (&#34;No Rest for the Wicked&#34;). Using [[[SCP-076|SCP-076-2]]]&#39;s unique abilities targeted towards pillows, we anticipate total elimination of pillows from Earth by 12/31/1997.

//Secure. Contain. Pillows. –Administrator █████//

**7/29/1993:** JTF Zeta-1 has successfully destroyed every pillow in North America. MTF Epsilon-21 (&#34;Pillow Fighters&#34;) is formed to monitor the continent for pillow-like activity and neutralize any pro-pillow advocates.

//Filthy pillow huggers. Request re-assignment to MTF Epsilon-21. –Able//

//Denied. –O5-█//

**5/16/1995:** Success in Europe. No notable casualties except for the entire population of the country of Iceland, which was inadvertently set on fire from the air. Dr. ███████ has been placed on paid leave for one week as punishment.

//Ironic, that. The punishment would&#39;ve been longer but, you know. Björk. –O5-█//

**6/6/1996:** The last pillow on Earth has been destroyed, well ahead of schedule. The role of JTF Zeta-1 has changed to monitoring/policing.

//A victory for mankind. –Dr. ███████//

**6/9/1996:** Junior Researcher █████ notices that SCP-042-J still exists on the bed itself, and in fact pillows are not and have never been central to the anomaly.

//FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU- -O5-█//
