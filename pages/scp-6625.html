+++ SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES
[[/=]]
SCP-6625 is, at present, partially contained; while the Foundation has quarantined most affected regions, it is believed that live samples of SCP-6625 remain present within civilian occupied zones and could therefore initiate novel outbreaks. As such, Provisional Mobile Task Force 6625-LIMA has been established by direct order of O5 Command and tasked with conducting Quick Reaction Strikes (QRS) against civilian zones confirmed to be affected by SCP-6625. All personnel exhibiting symptoms of SCP-6625 are to be considered hostile and terminated on sight. Treatment of subjects infected with SCP-6625 is strictly forbidden due to the inherent risk of infection posed by interaction with such personnel. Affected regions will be evaluated depending on the extent of SCP-6625&#39;s spread within the area in question, with the Foundation&#39;s response correlating to the perceived severity of the outbreak. These classifications are as follows:
* **Class One:** The most easily contained stage of an outbreak. Class One outbreaks typically involve the infection of an isolated settlement or extremely remote area, often comprising fewer than twenty-five (25) total infected. PMTF 6625-LIMA is usually deployed in these regions and tasked with simply terminating all infected personnel. 
* **Class Two:** A more dangerous, though still easily contained outbreak. Class Two outbreaks often incorporate small municipal areas or towns of moderate size, with the total number of infected ranging between fifty (50) and two hundred fifty (250). PMTF 6625-Lima can be deployed to such areas in an attempt to neutralize all infected personnel, though this may prove hazardous without intervention from other MTF units or air support. 
* **Class Three:** A significant threat, often involving the infection of most residents within a large metropolitan area or expansive region. A Class Three outbreak usually entails the infection of between two hundred fifty (250) and one thousand (1000) individuals, though higher numbers of infected are common. The difficulty posed by containing a Class Three outbreak necessitates the simultaneous use of multiple Mobile Task Force units, including PMTF 6625-Lima and a battalion-strength detachment for support. In some cases, the destruction or permanent quarantine of the affected region may prove necessary. 
* **##orange|Class Four##:** A global pandemic. Containment efforts involve multi-stage operations on the part of the Foundation and other organizations concerned with the anomalous, likely taking several years if not longer before meaningful containment progress can be made. A Class Four outbreak would likely necessitate the lifting of the Veil and the development of a Foundation capable of existing in a post-secrecy world. Most major population centers will succumb to the infection, and major governments are likely to either collapse or engage in conflicts with adjacent countries due to a decline in geopolitical stability. If left unchecked, a Class Four outbreak would ultimately lead to an XK-Class End of the World scenario. 

All samples of SCP-6625 possessed by the Foundation are held in the Level 5 Biosafety Wing (L5BW) of Site-921, located on the ground floor past three IX-Class decontamination chambers. All personnel intending to enter a 50m radius surrounding the L5BW must submit to thorough decontamination protocols and receive explicit authorization from O5 Command prior to entry. Such personnel must remain within a Level 5 Biosafety Protection Suit (L5BPS) for a minimum of thirty (30) minutes prior to and thirty (30) minutes following exposure to SCP-6625 in any capacity. Removal of any portion of a subject&#39;s L5BPS is considered an attempt at breaching containment and will result in immediate termination by on-site security personnel. Any suit punctures, tears, or other damage that could result in direct exposure to SCP-6625 must similarly be responded to with the immediate termination of the subject in question. 

Following termination of an infected individual, the subject&#39;s cadaver must be immediately incinerated by a Biohazard Disposal Team equipped with L5BPS equipment. Incineration is the only known method of rendering a host cadaver incapable of spreading SCP-6625.

+++ DESCRIPTION
[[/=]]
[[include component:image-block
| name=virus.jpg
| caption=SCP-6625 (electron microscope image) 
]]
SCP-6625 designates a complex human retrovirus believed to be of zoonotic or extraterrestrial origin. SCP-6625 consists of mRNA enclosed within a spiked protein capsule, with an overall appearance and infection behavior comparable to that of //Influenza// viruses, albeit with an overall diameter roughly 19% smaller than that of //Influenza-A// and //Influenza-B.// There are six known strains of SCP-6625, each possessing relatively minor deviations in their genetic sequence concerning the total number of protein spikes along the exterior capsule, thus providing each strain a varying degree of infectivity. While SCP-6625 is capable of infecting virtually any organism with a eukaryotic composition, the pathogen is only symptomatic in //Homo sapiens.// 

Like biologically similar viruses, SCP-6625 primarily spreads through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected subject or surfaces they have recently made physical contact with. SCP-6625 appears to most easily spread through saliva, blood, feces, urine, and semen/vaginal fluids, though is theoretically capable of spreading through cerebrospinal fluid and virtually any other liquid within the human body. On most surfaces, SCP-6625 remains active for a period of 24 to 48 hours, though contact with most soaps and cleaning solutions will destroy its protein capsule, rendering it incapable of infecting healthy cells. 

Once it has infected a given human host, the rate at which SCP-6625 spreads throughout the subject&#39;s body is markedly faster than would be expected from //Influenza,// possessing an incubation period of approximately thirty-nine (39) minutes. Symptoms emerge in a set of five stages, culminating in the emergence of SCP-6625&#39;s primary anomalous properties; until this stage, most symptoms are generally within the parameters of a standard respiratory disease. Subjects possessing compromising medical conditions or of an advanced age may not survive until the final stage of infection. The anomalous effects of SCP-6625, therefore, are not guaranteed to manifest.

The stages of SCP-6625 infection are as follows:
* **Stage One:** Dry cough. Sneezing. Low-grade fever. Minor to moderate muscle aches. General malaise[[footnote]]A non-specific feeling of being unwell.[[/footnote]]. 
* **Stage Two:** Increased frequency of coughing. Moderate-grade fever. Production of sputum. Nausea, accompanied by possible intermittent vomiting.
* **Stage Three:** Nearly continuous coughing. High-grade fever (39.4° Celsius/103.0° Fahrenheit or higher). Internal hemorrhaging in a manner similar to Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) or Marburg Virus Disease (MVD). Disorientation, often accompanied by loss of fine motor control. 
* **Stage Four:** Beginning of conversion of subject&#39;s biomass into an SCP-6625-01 instance (see below). 
* **Stage Five:** Termination of host[[footnote]]While it cannot be confirmed that the vital signs of the host cease due to the nature of a SCP-6625-01 instance, there is no known mechanism by which any living organism could survive the conversion process.[[/footnote]]. Completion of conversion into an SCP-6625-01 instance. 

SCP-6625 possesses a case mortality rate of 100%, though as mentioned previously, the stage at which the subject expires varies based on a variety of physiological and environmental circumstances. Assuming a given host does not possess any prior medical conditions and is in reasonably good health, the probability that they will reach Stage Five of the infection is roughly 92%. The only reliable method of preventing progression of the infection is the termination of the afflicted subject, which will immediately preclude all potential anomalous activity (though the subject&#39;s cadaver remains contagious and should be incinerated per the Special Containment Procedures for SCP-6625).

]]

SCP-6625-01 designates the physiological and psychological changes that occur should a subject reach Stage Five of SCP-6625 infection. Instances of SCP-6625-01 exhibit no measurable signs of life, but are nonetheless animate and sentient. Superficially, SCP-6625-01 appears indistinguishable from specimens of //Triticum// (wheat) and can be harvested or used in wheat-based products in a manner consistent with its non-anomalous counterparts. SCP-6625-01 is capable of locomotion through use of its &#34;roots,&#34; which can be removed from soil spontaneously and walked upon in a similar fashion to feet. Instances will wander somewhat aimlessly until coming into contact with other Stage Five infected personnel, at which point they will root themselves near each other in an attempt to establish a &#34;field.&#34; 

If a sufficient number of SCP-6625-01 instances coalesce within a given area, vaguely humanoid entities with elongated limbs, collectively designated SCP-6625-02, will begin to appear within the field of SCP-6625-01. These entities appear to feed on SCP-6625-01 instances exclusively, continuing to do so as long as such a food source exists. SCP-6625-02 specimens are carriers for SCP-6625 and appear to deliberately expose themselves to healthy human beings whenever possible to ensure a continued supply of food. If all SCP-6625-01 instances within a given area are destroyed, all corresponding instances of SCP-6625-02 will vanish through unknown means. 

Various visual and auditory phenomena are believed to emanate from SCP-6625-01 fields, including vocalizations described as similar to human screaming, sobbing, and ##red|[{{INFOHAZARD REMOVED | AUTOMATED CHANGE: UNKNOWN}}]##. Limited auditory analysis of these vocalizations suggests they are consistent with recordings taken of known SCP-6625 victims.

+++ DISCOVERY
[[/=]]
[[include component:image-block

| caption=Sunny Wheat Farms prior to identification of SCP-6625.
]]
Initial reports of SCP-6625 were misattributed to a potential outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease due to symptomatic similarities in the infection&#39;s early stages. Members of the Centers for Disease Control were dispatched to Topeka, Kansas in response to these reports, initially operating as if the cause of the symptoms in affected subjects was either EVD or MVD. However, upon coming into contact with an instance of SCP-6625-01, a Foundation field operative embedded in the CDC contacted Site-921&#39;s Biohazard and Chemical Hazard Containment Department, at which point PMTF 6625-LIMA was dispatched to Topeka, administering Class-B amnestics to all CDC and civilian personnel in the area.

The Topeka outbreak of SCP-6625 was contained with relative ease due to the total number of infected (between 25 and 30). All instances of SCP-6625-01 were destroyed, with samples of SCP-6625 being collected for later analysis. However, the Foundation was contacted by an unnamed individual identifying himself as an employee of &#34;Sunny Wheat Farms,&#34; an agriculture corporation with several facilities in the area surrounding the outbreak site. Following the lead provided by this individual, PMTF 6625-LIMA subsequently investigated a Sunny Wheat Farms facility in Topeka under the guise of performing a US Department of Agriculture inspection. 

A transcript of the investigation is provided below.

&gt; //[Investigation team consists of four PMTF 6625-LIMA operatives: Cmdr. Daniel Martin, Sgt. Roger Heinback, Cpl. Sarah Martinez, and Cpl. Kendra Brannigan. Team is equipped with hidden cameras and are wearing USDA inspector garb, along with basic safety equipment for use in slaughterhouses or areas with pesticide usage.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[Team arrives via unmarked black SUV at the Topeka Sunny Wheat Farms facility. They are greeted by a representative of the company, who identifies himself as the facility supervisor.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** You the USDA guys? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Martin:** That&#39;s right. Sorry for the hold-up. Traffic. Y&#39;know how it is. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** Yeah, no problem. //[He looks at the team for a few seconds.]// Quite a few of you this time. Usually, you guys send one or two.
&gt; 
&gt; **Heinback:** Well, with the CDC floating around, can&#39;t be too careful. Don&#39;t want whatever&#39;s going on down here hitting the farms up here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** Yeah, makes sense, I guess. So, how do you want this to go down? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Martin:** Start us at the fields themselves and we&#39;ll work our way through the place. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[The supervisor nods. He leads the team in the direction of the crop fields, roughly 0.3km from the main facility.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Brannigan:** What did you say your name, was? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** It&#39;s Mike.
&gt; 
&gt; **Brannigan:** Last name? It&#39;s just for our records. Procedure and all that. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** Mike Wilson.[[footnote]]There are no records of such an individual in the Topeka area.[[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **Brannigan:** &#39;Kay, thanks. How long you been working here, Mike? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Wilson:** Fifteen years, maybe? It gets fuzzy after a while. //[He laughs.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Martinez:** Fifteen years. Dang. Must really love the place. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** //[Laughing]// I wouldn&#39;t put it like that, ma&#39;am. It&#39;s not so much loving the place as it is loving the paycheck.
&gt; 
&gt; **Martinez:** Good salary, then?
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** The best, ma&#39;am. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[They proceed to the fields. A large combine is slowly making its away across the terrain. Brannigan notices that the driver is wearing a full head wrap, preventing any facial features from being seen aside from the driver&#39;s eyes.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Brannigan:** What&#39;s with the wrap? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** Pardon? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Brannigan:** The, uh -- the driver over there. His face is wrapped.
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** Oh. Just a cultural thing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Heinback:** What culture? 
&gt; 
&gt; //[The supervisor looks around for a moment.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** You know, it&#39;s the funniest thing -- I never actually asked. We sorta just leave him alone.
&gt; 
&gt; **Martinez:** Okay, hang on a second, sir.
&gt; 
&gt; **Brannigan:** We don&#39;t need to -- 
&gt; 
&gt; **Martinez:** Sorry, it&#39;s just -- you can&#39;t seriously expect us to believe you&#39;ve never spoken to that man. I mean, what sort of culture requires a full head wrap? That never struck you as odd? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** I really don&#39;t --
&gt; 
&gt; //[The supervisor looks around again, appearing as if he is extremely agitated.]// 
&gt; 
&gt; **Martinez:** I&#39;m not trying to make you uncomfortable. My apologies. I just find what you&#39;re saying to be very...well, strange. That&#39;s all. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** I just let him do his job, ma&#39;am. I don&#39;t see a reason to speak to anyone unless they //give// me a reason. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Martinez:** Well, could we talk to him, then? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** Well, he&#39;s on the clock right now, so uh -- I&#39;m not really sure, um, how that would...go down with the boss.
&gt; 
&gt; **Brannigan:** But you said you were the supervisor.
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** The title is really just a formality, sir. I&#39;m more or less just a klandaw&#39;run //[sic]//. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Brannigan:** A //what?//
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** The, uh...oh boy, how do I explain this. So, err, essentially, the bosses have their own language -- they have their own terms they, y&#39;know, give things and give certain roles. A klandaw&#39;run is like...middle management. I can tell people to do things, but I don&#39;t have any say in the actual, y&#39;know, decision making process.
&gt; 
&gt; **Brannigan:** I see.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Brannigan motions for the supervisor to proceed with the tour. He leads the team out of the fields toward a large warehouse comprised of brick and reinforced wood. The door swings open, revealing an unlit interior with hay coating the floor.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** Now, I must warn you, the smell in here might be, uh, a bit disagreeable, so --
&gt; 
&gt; **Heinback:** Jesus Christ --
&gt; 
&gt; //[They proceed further inside. The supervisor activates a flashlight, revealing walls covered in an unidentified greenish-black substance.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Heinback:** What&#39;s on the -- 
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** The walls? Just some stuff we use to counter erosion.
&gt; 
&gt; **Heinback:** Erosion?
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** Not the best term for it, I know. Again, bosses, words...I just do what I&#39;m told. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Brannigan:** I can tell you right now this is not in compliance with code.
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** //[Laughter]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Brannigan:** What&#39;s funny? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** I never expected you guys to give us the ol&#39; checkmark, trust me. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[The group proceeds further inside. There is a large collection of wheat at the end of the path, some of which is plastered to the wall by the aforementioned substance.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Martinez (muffled):** What the fuck? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** What do you think? 
&gt; 
&gt; //[He gestures to the wheat.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Brannigan:** I&#39;m...not sure what I&#39;m looking at here. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** Well, we took it upon ourselves to develop our own...I guess you could call it process for, uh, harvesting. Wheat in the fields, y&#39;know -- there&#39;s so many crops that they can get cramped. They&#39;re alive, y&#39;know. You put &#39;em in bad conditions, and the harvest will be &#34;below standards,&#34; as my boss would say. So, we give them some space to breathe before we ship &#39;em out. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Brannigan:** What does that do for the wheat, exactly? I mean, I don&#39;t see any other farms doing this. You&#39;d think they would if, uh...if it was so beneficial, right? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** Well, I&#39;m not sure if I should really say, but --
&gt; 
&gt; //[He gestures around.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** A lot of people don&#39;t realize this, but there&#39;s two different kinds of wheat. There&#39;s the stuff you&#39;re familiar with, and then there&#39;s this stuff. We like to think we have our own special recipe here, but - heh - honestly, nature does the hard work for us. This strand we use, we uh -- we found it a long time ago. Sometime in the 60&#39;s when the company was founded. Can&#39;t remember when exactly, but the point is -- this stuff is harder to cultivate, to grow, but it&#39;s worth it. Guarantee you won&#39;t find a tastier slice of bread once it&#39;s all said and done.
&gt; 
&gt; **Brannigan:** What species is this, exactly?
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not at liberty to say. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Brannigan:** Wheat is one of the most well documented crops in the world, sir. Surely you can just tell us the species your company cultivates.
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** &#39;Fraid I can&#39;t do that, sir. If you&#39;d like, you can submit a request with Customer Relations, and they&#39;ll get back to you promptly.
&gt; 
&gt; **Brannigan:** Right. Very well. I think that&#39;s all we need, so uh --
&gt; 
&gt; //[The microphone picks up a subtle rustling noise.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Martinez:** Hear that? 
&gt; 
&gt; //[The camera focuses on the wheat plastered to the wall. Several pieces of it are missing, with the remaining pieces beginning to slightly twitch.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** I&#39;m afraid this is the, uh -- end of the tour, so if you could just follow me to, uh, the entrance --
&gt; 
&gt; **Martinez:** What&#39;s going on? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** Just a draft. Nothing to worry about, ma&#39;am. Follow me please.
&gt; 
&gt; **Martinez:** The wheat is moving.
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor:** The tour is over. Please follow me. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[The team complies, capturing additional footage of the wall as they exit the structure. The wheat seems to begin writhing more intensely as they exit through the door to the warehouse. Egress from area is uneventful. Footage and documentation submitted to Project Lead for analysis.]//

+ ##black |DOCUMENT 01: SAMPLE ANALYSIS 6625.01##
##black |Analysis Conducted 12/13/2009##
##black |Dr. Jeremy Pogan##
-----
##black| **Overview:** Sample collected from investigation of &#34;Sunny Wheat Farms&#34; facility in Topeka, Kansas. Analysis environment sterilized prior to analysis. All presiding personnel equipped with Biosafety Level 4 HAZMAT equipment. Sample appears superficially identical to an ordinary specimen of //Triticum aestivum.// Dirt and ordinary microbial life present on sample at time of analysis and not determined to be cause for concern.##

##black| **Analysis Procedure:** Sample placed in airtight cell equipped with Level 3 ISO-TR Microbial Isolation Device (MID). Several portions of stem severed and collected for later substance analysis. ##

##black|**Results:** Sample presents several unique properties significantly differentiating it from a typical specimen of //Triticum aestivum.// In general, findings suggest sample was at one point a sentient organism with a complex nervous system and brain comparable in function to that of //Homo sapiens.// Sample also contained inert virions later identified as instances of SCP-6625. Though sample had expired prior to analysis, rudimentary analysis of cognitive patterns was possible through microscopic electrical stimulation of various portions of the stem, believed to crudely represent analogous components within the human brain. Results follow:##
* ##black |Lower stem stimulated. Resulting cognitive response interpreted as consistent with human pleasure response.##
* ##black |Middle section of stem stimulated. Resulting response interpreted as consistent with physical pain.##
* ##black |Upper section of stem stimulated. Resulting response interpreted as consistent with extreme fear response, followed by apprehension and/or anguish. Following this test, all additional stimulation yielded an identical response, suggesting previous responses were not congruent with the specimen&#39;s &#34;actual&#34; state.##

##black| **Human Testing:** Subject D-995 exposed to testing environment and instructed to consume sample. Subject was not provided any contextual information regarding SCP-6625 and was informed sample was an ordinary specimen of //Triticum aestivum// in order to ensure compliance. Subject complied, ingesting sample before immediately inquiring as to whether or not the test had concluded. Approximately two minutes following consumption, subject complained of a low-level migraine, which escalated in intensity until he sat on the floor of the testing environment. Subject complained of a general sense of despair, with marked behavioral deviations relative to his state at the beginning of the test. Subject then attempted to forcibly induce vomiting; when questioned, subject stated &#34;It&#39;s something else&#34; and declined to respond to further inquiries. A security team was dispatched into the testing environment to prevent vomiting, but D-995 was successful in forcibly ejecting the sample. Microphones present in the testing environment recorded a high-pitched noise described as a &#34;shriek&#34; or a &#34;scream&#34; originating from an unknown source, accompanied by violent writhing of the (now expelled) sample. Sample eventually ceased to move, possibly due to degradation caused by exposure to bile and stomach acids. D-995 was non-compliant when approached by the security team and was sedated.##

##black|**Recommendation:** Further human testing not advised.##

+++ ADDENDUM: DOCUMENT 6625.RA
[[/=]]
On ██/██/████, an unmarked USB drive was delivered to Site-921 by an unidentified individual. Upon confirmation from Site IT that the USB did not contain malware, an analysis of the drive&#39;s contents was conducted. This analysis yielded an 821 KB executable file simply named &#34;Manifest.exe.&#34; 

Upon being launched on any version of the Windows operating system from Windows 7 onward, a window will appear that locks mouse movement to within its borders. The program will first display the logo of Sunny Wheat Farms before transitioning to what appears to be a file manager, itself containing various documents and shipping manifests pertinent to the transportation of products created by the company. The majority of these documents appear to be mundane Microsoft Excel spreadsheet files with dates and product costs. 

However, a video file named &#34;Internal_Report.MP4&#34; was located, which can be played by any standard video playback software. The video lacks audio, but a transcript of the video can be found below.

&gt; **&lt;BEGIN PLAYBACK&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **00:03:** The Sunny Wheat Farms logo appears before gradually fading to black.
&gt; 
&gt; **00:10:** A map of the contiguous United States appears, with several portions of the country appearing in red. The remainder of the country appears in dark blue. A date appears at the bottom of the screen, beginning at 01/01/1960 and incrementing by one month every few seconds. Each time the date is incremented, more of the country is colored red.
&gt; 
&gt; **00:39:** The map pans out, revealing a map of the world. Various countries are colored red as the date continues to increment. By 01/01/2000, roughly 55% of the world is colored red. 
&gt; 
&gt; **01:12:** The date reaches 01/01/2020. Roughly 85% of the world is colored red. 
&gt; 
&gt; **01:15:** A simple animation plays, showing various other agricultural companies moving toward the Sunny Wheat Farms logo before dissolving. This is assumed to be representative of mergers/acquisitions. Notably, none of the companies shown in this animation publicly report being subsidiaries of Sunny Wheat Farms.
&gt; 
&gt; **01:30:** The animation ends with the Sunny Wheat Farms logo expanding until it encompasses the entirety of the screen.
&gt; 
&gt; **02:02:** A video of a family, presumably that of the American middle-class, plays. They are seated around a dinner table consuming various wheat-based dishes. They appear happy and maintain smiles for the duration of the clip.
&gt; 
&gt; **02:09:** A tall, gaunt entity enters the frame resembling an instance of SCP-6625-02. A young male child, presumed to be the youngest son, appears to display disgust upon consuming a slice of bread. The SCP-6625-02 instance moves to him, retrieving another slice of bread and placing it on the boy&#39;s plate. The boy initially attempts to move away before the instance makes eye contact. The boy then retrieves the slice of bread and begins ingesting it, his expression gradually morphing into one of contentment similar to the rest of the family.
&gt; 
&gt; **02:15:** Several of the products on the table begin to writhe.
&gt; 
&gt; **02:29:** The entity stands along the edge of the table and raises its hands, making direct eye contact with the camera. The products on the table writhe more intensely before the clip abruptly cuts to black. In the final twenty seconds of the clip, the boy can be seen abruptly leaving the table in a manner consistent with apprehension; the instance lowers its arms and moves in his direction as the family observes them, maintaining their smiles. 
&gt; 
&gt; **02:47:** End of file. The .exe file abruptly closes, returning to the Windows desktop. 

After this file was analyzed, an investigation was conducted into the companies seen in the aforementioned video. Substance analysis revealed the presence of trace amounts of inert SCP-6625 in the vast majority of commercial products. 

It is currently estimated Sunny Wheat Farms is directly involved in approximately 89% of global wheat-based products.
