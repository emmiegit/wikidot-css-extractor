&gt; 
&gt; Additionally, the characterization of Buck here is notably different from the other ACT tales, being more... lunatic. I love him like this, but by the second tale, I realized he&#39;s a lover, not a killer.

&gt; 
&gt; The first time Buck&#39;s killed someone without the pomp and circumstance or even hyperviolence. Just a dialogue between two fucked up folks in the California desert.
&gt; 
&gt; My personal favorite bit was suggested to me by [[*user Uncle_Nicolini]], and it uses a one-off gag I mentioned for a tale they&#39;re writing about Buck, which is that Buck carries around cigarettes but doesn&#39;t smoke them.
&gt; 
&gt; A comedy plot point turns into a setup for communion between Anoati and Buck which turns to a refutation of that communion and a loss of common ground.
&gt; 
&gt; Love it.

&gt; uraniumempire on the wiki actually gave me the idea to put this in reverse order, and it works hella well for this.
&gt; 
&gt; but god was this hard to write. there&#39;s a reason i took so long to write it, and it&#39;s because i couldn&#39;t think of a single dang thing to make the character who gets killed interesting, i hate the CI, and i wrote a fuckin killer opening and had trouble getting past it [but later just put it at the end].
&gt; 
&gt; i think it&#39;s good though! i very much enjoy it.

&gt; 
&gt; yet another angry article, who would&#39;ve thunk it.
&gt; 
&gt; originally? this started out as a tale based on tufto&#39;s excellent 001 proposal. the one about the scarlet king. i don&#39;t want to spoil it if you haven&#39;t read it, but a lot of the conflict here is based on ideas presented there.
&gt; 
&gt; however, the tale originally starred two brothers, each who eventually went to join opposing factions. this didn&#39;t pan out because it would&#39;ve been way fuckin longer and also would&#39;ve restricted the focus of the tale to something i didn&#39;t want.
&gt; 
&gt; ah well, such is life.

&gt; 
&gt; deci pm&#39;d me one day and asked me to take a stab at rewriting this. one thing that sticks with me from that conversation is her saying &#34;I think you and taffeta are the best possible kind of people to do a rewrite of this if it were to happen.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; while i logically know that she isn&#39;t digging on me for liking anime a lot, god.
&gt; 
&gt; i actually didn&#39;t do anything with it until nearly a month after she first asked. i dunno why i came back to it. maybe because i wanted to see some oldnew life back in cool war 2?
&gt; 
&gt; go write for cool war two. basard
