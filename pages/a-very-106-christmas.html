They had been staring at his cracked, toothy grin for what seemed like hours. 

Within the frigid, vacant interior of a silent concrete cell, the blackened nightmare stood with a perfectly straightened and upright posture, flashing the door with an unflinching smile. Sloughing off the tips of his burnt fingers was a heated black tar, drooping in thick globs to the ground with a whispering //hiss//. Past the drooping epidermis of the man were a set of dried, crumbling organs, rising and falling with a peculiar rhythm as his soiled lungs emitted a soft, strained breath with each contraction. 

Nobody had seen his eyes move for days. But he was watching the cell&#39;s camera; observing it with a cold, dispassionate patience, taking mental note of every subtle repositioning and focusing of the lens. 

Twenty or so feet away from the cell was a command post, manned by several balding, middle-aged men in white lab coats and foggy spectacles. One of them, jotting down a set of notes against clamped paper adorning a stained clipboard, gave a hushed scoff. 

&#34;Son of a bitch hasn&#39;t done anything since the last breach event,&#34; the man began, shaking his head as if confused by his own sentence. He craned his neck over a computer terminal in the direction of a female colleague. &#34;It&#39;s Christmas Eve. OP-II has been here for twelve hours. Send them home.&#34; 

She turned in his direction, continuing to type something into the body of an email. 

&#34;You make it sound like the Old Man gives a shit what time of year it is, Frank.&#34; 

With a slight chuckle, Frank gestured to the interior view of the cell on a nearby monitor. &#34;Think they celebrate Christmas on his planet?&#34; 

&#34;Planet?&#34; Sarah snickered, hating herself for even finding the remark slightly amusing. &#34;It&#39;s not an alien.&#34; 

&#34;Oh, my apologies. I didn&#39;t realize you knew where he was from.&#34; 

&#34;Do you?&#34; 

Frank nodded. &#34;I know it&#39;s not an alien.&#34; 

&#34;How?&#34; She inquired, turning her office chair in his direction as the conversation began to enrapture her. 

The man lowered his balding, glossy head towards the camera view, allowing his eyes to dart around the image of the dripping, melting figure before he pointed to its face. His fattened finger pressed against the screen, leaving a barely visible, oily smudge.

&#34;He&#39;s smiling.&#34; 

Sarah giggled again. &#34;Aliens can&#39;t smile?&#34; 

&#34;No, that&#39;s not what I mean,&#34; Frank retorted. &#34;Why would aliens come here, Sarah? What would their motivation be?&#34; His expression suddenly became stern; professorial, even. She played along, draping her slender hands across her thighs. 

&#34;I don&#39;t know, Frank. Resources? Test subjects? A fascination with anal probing?&#34; 

He disregarded the juvenile nature of the last suggestion. &#34;All things that would justify the trip to some backwater mudball of a planet, presumably. But what does he do?&#34; 

Frank pressed his finger against the oscillating image of the creature, his tone growing more flat as he continued. 

&#34;He hunts. That&#39;s it. He doesn&#39;t even //eat// people, as far as we now. He just tortures, and maims, and kills, all for the sport of it.&#34; 

&#34;I can see an alien being some sort of sociopathic game hunter. You clearly haven&#39;t seen //Predator.//&#34;

&#34;No, Sarah.&#34; He shook his head defiantly. &#34;There&#39;s something very cruel about him. There&#39;s no honor in it. There&#39;s no higher purpose. He&#39;s not making offerings to some god or -- or getting rid of what he thinks is a parasite on the back of the cosmos.&#34; 

For emphasis, he turned to her, pushing his glasses back up the bridge of his nose.

&#34;He just likes what he does. And that&#39;s why he does it.&#34; 

Before she could entirely process the sobering, disconcerting nature of what her coworker said, there was a high-pitched screeching, bouncing off the walls as it shook her eardrums. A piercing, scarlet light filled the command room, casting blood red shadows against the now panicked men and women within its walls. Sarah rocketed out of her seat and looked around, the computer monitors along the walls displaying flashing exclamation points and various warnings as something began to sway and crack like a wave from the ocean. 

Frank grasped the sides of a monitor, a cold bead of sweat trickling down his forehead. &#34;Jesus. Jesus Christ.&#34; 

&#34;What?&#34; She asked, panicked. Frank&#39;s body was obscuring the monitor, but she almost immediately knew what he was watching.

&#34;He&#39;s leaving,&#34; he proclaimed, throwing his weight back and beginning to shift towards the door to the room. &#34;He&#39;s fucking leaving. Get containment down here.&#34; 

&#34;What do you mean, Frank?&#34; The pitch of her voice started to waver back and forth like a pendulum. &#34;What do you mean he&#39;s leaving?&#34; 

The only response she received came from the distorted blaring of the facility&#39;s PA system. In her bewildered, disoriented apprehension, she made out two words -- &#34;breach&#34; and &#34;one-oh-six.&#34; By the time she reached the door, the hallway had become a tapestry of dripping, still slightly trembling limbs.

&#34;I look fucking ridiculous.&#34; 

The taller guard, body armor and freshly polished boots clinging to his moistened flesh, looked into the bathroom mirror as he adjusted his Santa hat. The festive item clashed violently with the rest of his wardrobe, sticking out against the minimalist blacks and greys like a softened cone atop a wrapped, obscured head. As the fluffy white ball at the hat&#39;s tip jostled, a voice came from behind him.

&#34;It&#39;s Christmas. You&#39;re supposed to be festive,&#34; said a shorter guard, trying his best to restrain his laughter.

&#34;Then why don&#39;t you wear it, asshole?&#34; 

Another laugh. &#34;Because I&#39;m Jewish.&#34; 

&#34;Jewish people can&#39;t wear Santa hats?&#34; 

&#34;It&#39;s in the Torah,&#34; he replied, continuing to giggle. &#34;Look it up, Bill.&#34; 

He adjusted the hat again, nodding as he finally found a position for it he deemed acceptable. Bill turned to the other guard as his cheekbones pressed against the face wrap in a slight smirk. 

&#34;Festive enough, Kevin?&#34; 

Kevin said nothing, desperately fighting the urge to chortle again. He checked a PDA clamped to his belt, noticing that there was a missed alert from one of his commanding officers. 

&#34;Time to go.&#34; 

&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; Bill asked, checking his own device as he waited for an answer. The screen was rapidly blinking a deep reddish-orange, a spinning white circle rotating in the center. He pressed a button and brought several lines of outlined text against the faded background, his face almost immediately contorting into one of trepidation. 

&#34;He&#39;s out,&#34; Kevin stated anxiously, starting to shakily move towards the bathroom door. &#34;Fuck, man. Let&#39;s go. We gotta move.&#34; 

&#34;What?&#34; 

&#34;Come on!&#34; He shouted, waving for Bill to follow him out. 

As they stepped into the doorway, there was a heaving, clicking noise, morphing into a slushy squelching as something began to gradually drip from the ceiling. The liquid seemed to sear the air itself as it descended onto the slick tile, embedding itself into the floor with a corrosive hiss, the bathroom&#39;s water beginning to stream into the newly punctured holes. Around them, the walls seemed to begin slowly breathing, drifting slightly away from their corners as glistening, onyx pools formed in their centers with a low pounding. It was as if the room itself had become jelly; Kevin felt his boots begin to slip into the ground like it was quicksand, feeling something melt away the skin of his leg like it was fried oil.

&#34;Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck --&#34; 

Bill tried to sprint away, the tip of his boot meeting a slick puddle of the tar as he fell face first to the ground. Kevin heard a grotesque crunching noise as his friend viciously collided with the floor, a darkened puddle of crimson beginning to lurch away from where his face had met the grid-like surface. The black sludge ran towards the fallen guard, crackling like popcorn as it touched the exterior of his face, the aroma of pungent rot wafting through the air. 

&#34;Bill! Bill!&#34; He screamed, trying to grab onto something as he slowly descended into the base of the building. Kevin managed to coil his fingers around the handle of a stall door only for them to slip off, screaming as everything became only slightly out of reach. A fissure in the walls, spreading like the web of a spider, forged a schism along the bathroom&#39;s perimeter as more of the tar poured in from the newly created gash. 

Kevin looked to his left again, seeing Bill place both of his hands on the writhing tile floor and push upward. With a pained grunt, Bill was able to rise to his feet, stumbling and hobbling around for a few seconds in a daze; when he turned around to face Kevin, both hands grasped the side of his head as something buried itself into the recesses of his skull. 

Bill&#39;s face was entirely gone, replaced by an asphyxiating black mass driving itself into the space between his eyes and the bridge of his nose. Much of the flesh and tissue covering his head had been corroded away, replaced with the blank, shadowed visage of an almost featureless face, the only organs remaining being a freed tongue and a single, slowly melting eye; its white goo began to trickle down his cheek, running along his face then his body like a melted, poached egg. 

Kevin heard Bill scream and try to speak, but all that came out was a garbled, squelching amalgamation of incomprehensible squeals. The latter pulled his hands away, the last bits of skin and muscle tearing away from his mandibles like melted butter as it drooped from his fingers and stretched towards the floor. With a wet, slapping sigh, Bill fell to the ground and twitched for a few seconds, then grew still.

As Kevin found everything below the neck now beneath the floor, two milky orbs emerged from one of the stalls, glistening like jewels in the flickering light above him. They rotated in their sockets for a few seconds until they were joined by a smiling mouth, odorous black pus plopping out of the corners of its lips as the grin stretched farther than Kevin&#39;s eyes could see. He almost thought he saw it winking as everything became a deep, impregnable black, and he sank into the bowels of agony itself.

On the morning of December 26, SCP-106 was standing in its containment chamber with arms crossed over its chest, once again as motionless as the sturdiest of flagpoles. The Task Force that swept through the facility had since cleaned up the bodies -- what was left of them -- and put everything back in order. Site Command even had the luxury of telling the psychological response team to stand down given that the new staff were all green; every previous researcher had been stricken from the record. It was thought wise to keep the details on a need-to-know basis. 

During the first few hours following recontainment, an oddity was recorded by the cell security camera.

106&#39;s head was adorned with a tattered, heavily damaged red shape, believed to be comprised of fabric and stained cotton. It sat on the surface of his scalp for five, maybe ten minutes before completely dissolving into a shapeless mass of ashy, pulpy matter. He looked at the remnants of the item for a few seconds and touched it, seeming as if he was trying to put it back together before the endeavor was abandoned.

During site policy revisions, Site Command found it prudent to place an indefinite ban on Christmas-themed articles of clothing for all facility personnel.
