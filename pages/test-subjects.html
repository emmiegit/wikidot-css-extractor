||||~ B82SW/9KL74/Y4P1K||
||~ Status||Renting||
||~ Demand||High||
||~ Value||250USD/200GBP per Subject, 2300USD/1690.60GBP per Set (10 Subjects)||
||~ Availability||Established Supply Chain||
||~ Identifier||Test Subjects||
||~ Description||Items are humanoid entities, identical in composure and physiology to that of a standard, non-anomalous //Homo sapiens//. Coming in sets sorted by biological sex, items are entirely obedient towards their thaumaturgically-linked owner(s); they will listen to any physically possible order. Items do not require nutrition or rest to survive, staying in place when not ordered otherwise. Despite not being sentient, items react with the entire spectrum of human emotions to appropriate stimuli. ||

||||||||~ Initial Report||
||~ Author || Iris Dark (Project Lead) ||~ Date || November 10, 2021||
||~ Interest||High||~ Identifier||Test Subjects||
||||||||The lack of testing subjects is a problem plaguing practically every single anomalous organization known to man -- from the D-Class of the SCP Foundation to the human sacrifices of the Deava, every single Organization has, at some point, come across the simple need for more men. The harsh truth however is that humans don&#39;t grow on trees -- or, rather, //normal// humans [[[scp-3989|don&#39;t grow on trees]]] -- and even if they did, maintaining a healthy person to properly use in tests is an extremely expensive endeavor. MC&amp;D, however, realized it doesn&#39;t //need to be// that way. _
 _
During my most recent trip to the newly-rebuilt Adytum, I was greeted by something that piqued my interest like nothing ever has. You see, the most wonderful feast I was lucky enough to take part in was served by human-like artificial golems, entirely obedient to their creators, tailored by the magic of the students of Grand Karcist Ion&#39;s sorcery. And, despite that night having so many other unique and mind-consuming emotions, I could not get those simple minions out of my head. And so I began to think. _
 _
With a team made up of a few of our capitalistic [[[sarkicism-hub|Nälkän]]] friends and a couple of paid specialists over at [[[prometheus-labs-hub|Prometheus]]], we were able to recreate something similar to what I witnessed, except in a much better form. With a leap of science as big as that of our old days, the company was able to introduce a way to fix all issues with the previously mentioned problem. Introducing B82SW/9KL74/Y4P1K: artificially grown, unconscious humans, accelerated to maturity with the magic of Yaldabaoth and controlled remotely by the combination of Prometheus technology and rituals performed by MC&amp;D specialists. Fully clean of corruption, despite their Sarkic origins, and controlled by a net of thaumaturgically-neural conductors throughout their brain, they will come in handy to any firm, person, or organization big enough to face the aforementioned problem. _
 _
Now available for a price lower than normal human maintenance, &#39;Test Subjects&#39; will listen to any order, as long as it&#39;s physically possible. From the simplest of household problems to the most hedonistic and sophisticated needs of their master, these thoughtless beings will always be there to listen.||

||||||||~ Message||
||~ From || Prometheus Labs ||~ To || Iris Dark (Project Lead)||
||||||||During one of the brain vivisections undertaken by Prometheus Labs personnel, one of the Test Subjects started to misinterpret stimuli given to its brain through direct neural stimulation and started to scream, running towards the nearest window, proceeding to jump out of it; a fix for this issue in further products alongside replacement copies for the faulty ones is officially requested.||
||||||||~ Prometheus Laboratories||
-----
||||||||~ Message||
||~ From || Prometheus Labs ||~ To || Iris Dark (Project Lead)||
||||||||During a company meeting regarding the previous flaw and the potential elimination of faulty copies, two of the subjects present within the room started to act out of place, understanding business chatter between myself and my colleagues as commands. Though the reaction was not as drastic as in the previous situation, only starting to move in a frantic manner around the room, apparently searching for a way out; it appears that B82SW/9KL74/Y4P1K possess some inherent flaw in their design. I once again request a fix to this issue be made, and officially further the proposition of my teams once again co-operating with MC&amp;D to take care of this.||

||||||||~ Message||
||~ From || Thomas Graham (Site-17 Director) ||~ To || Iris Dark (Project Lead)||
||||||||During field operation training, an entire team of Subjects suddenly stopped reacting to any orders given to them, instead starting to run at my men with their guns in a panicked manner, two of them firing. Total thaumaturgic resets didn&#39;t fix anything. You&#39;re lucky this wasn&#39;t an actual operation and that nobody died, or you&#39;d be fucked, Dark. I want a fix for this immediately.||
||||||||~ The SCP Foundation, Site-17||

||||||||~ Message||
||~ From || Iris Dark (Project Lead) ||~ To || Thomas Graham (Site-17 Director), Prometheus Labs||
||||||||The Company solemnly apologizes for all of the recent problems caused by B82SW/9KL74/Y4P1K; a total rebinding of the structures holding their thaumaturgic system in place revealed a few missed places throughout the formula. Everything should be fixed now (this also applies to the already bought products; the neural net exists throughout all products alike).||
||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, Ltd.||
-----
||||||||~ Message||
||~ From || Prometheus Labs ||~ To || Iris Dark (Project Lead)||
||||||||Everything does indeed seem to work perfectly, like promised. Prometheus Labs would however like to request an official extension of the deal -- at the current rate, Subjects are disappearing faster than we imagined, so a doubling of the current supply rate would be most beneficial. We give you the benefit of the doubt this isn&#39;t your products running away, but just an error on our part. Don&#39;t make us regret this gift.||

||||||||~ Message||
||~ From || The Critic ||~ To || Iris Dark (Project Lead)||
||||||||Dark, you sure your servants //actually work?// Or, rather, are you sure you fixed them? My boys constantly report our rented ones just stop working throughout the day, stopping halfway through a given order, starting to vandalize my staff and our art pieces. Which, you know, sucks when you run a chain of art galleries that need cleaning up because it&#39;s //fucking valuable art we have here//, y&#39;know? _
 _
An actual fix would be quite Cool indeed.||

||||||||~ Message||
||~ From || Chaz Ambrose ||~ To || Iris Dark (Project Lead)||
||||||||There appears to be a problem, Ms. Dark; during the preparation for consumption, one of our B82SW/9KL74/Y4P1Ks started to scream incoherently at my guests, spitting its insides all on the table. Thanks to your half-assed repairs of your own products, I lost an entire party; nobody wanted to enjoy themselves with anything anymore, saying I was trying to kill them! Here at Ambrose, the show must go on, and it can&#39;t just do that with my food rebelling against me. Fix your toys.||

|| December 13, 2021 || ~$40 000 || Cortex resets and memory wipes via the usage of amnestics utilized. Loss of approximately 10% of Subjects decided to be an acceptable loss to continue trade.||
|| December 31, 2021 || ~$50 000 || The concept of resistance removed from Subjects&#39; local noosphere. ||
|| January 12, 2022 || ~$80 000 || The concept of obedience added as the dominant idea into Subjects&#39; local noosphere; all other non-obedience ideas blocked from interacting with the main idea frame. ||
|| January 30, 2022 || N/A || The entire MC&amp;D Noospheric Division fired; new personnel with better qualifications employed. ||
|| February 3, 2022 || ~$40 000 || The concept of violence removed from Subjects&#39; local noosphere. ||
|| February 17, 2022 || ~$100 000 || Perception blockers regarding undertaking any unordered actions applied to all Subjects produced this far; retrieval squads with the intent of Subject replacements sent into the field. ||
|| March 3, 2022 || N/A || MC&amp;D Security Division recruitment once again opened and finalized shortly after full staffing was reached. ||
|| March 13, 2022 || N/A || All Subjects within Company custody eliminated. New line with total consciousness blocks without removal for profit save currently in the plans.  ||

||~ From || Thomas Graham (Site-17 Director) ||~ To || Iris Dark (Project Lead)||
||||||||Dark, I won&#39;t play any games and will just say what the issue is. We&#39;ve lost a large part of our Subjects due to the fact you just didn&#39;t fucking bother to tell us they were //actually sentient//. We had to execute over 10% of our total population due to how effective the rebellion of now fully in control beings would&#39;ve been if not stopped right that instant. I don&#39;t want to hear that goddamned scream any longer or I swear I&#39;ll go nuclear on you. All of my other D-class are now useless. I want you to explain yourself this goddamned instant.||

||~ From || Iris Dark (Project Lead) ||~ To || Thomas Graham (Site-17 Director)||
||||||||And what will we do about this, Mr. Graham? It&#39;d be a true shame if saving 1 pound per subject would have to cost us this much.||
||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, Ltd.||
-----
||||||||~ Message||
||~ From || Thomas Graham (Site-17 Director) ||~ To || Iris Dark (Project Lead)||
||||||||I&#39;m afraid our cooperation must stop this instant. Even if Site-17 will fully feel the pain of lack of your useful assets, the newly discovered properties and problems simply cannot be ignored. Our halls were filled with organs and blood, and I won&#39;t order my crew to clean them up for a second time.||

||||||||~ Message||
||~ From || Iris Dark (Project Lead) ||~ To || Thomas Graham (Site-17 Director)||
||||||||As I imagine, your Ethics Committee won&#39;t allow for the furthering of our contract due to... the rather questionable nature of it? A shame, I must say; it was truly a pleasure working with you.||
||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, Ltd.||
-----
||||||||~ Message||
||~ From || Thomas Graham (Site-17 Director) ||~ To || Iris Dark (Project Lead)||
||||||||My god, the Ethics Committee? //For ethics?// Don&#39;t make me laugh. I&#39;m //personally// resigning from it due to how inefficient this entire fiasco is. I&#39;m not paying for a faulty product from my limited budget, I&#39;m not insane.||
||||||||~ The SCP Foundation, Site-17||
-----
||||||||~ Message||
||~ From || Iris Dark (Project Lead) ||~ To || Thomas Graham (Site-17 Director)||
||||||||I feel like we can come to a compromise here, Mr. Graham; my current offer is a full replacement of all 50 000 copies within your storage to new versions, with full action blockers installed, for your continued support for any further purchases (with said new copies being, of course, fully blocked from any actual interactions; not feelings, no, they will still be there). Let me know what you think.||
||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, Ltd.||
-----
||||||||~ Message||
||~ From || Thomas Graham (Site-17 Director) ||~ To || Iris Dark (Project Lead)||
||||||||I&#39;m quite the fan, honestly. Would be fully on board if that would be your final offer. The work must go on.||

-----
||||||||~ Message||
||~ From || Iris Dark (Project Lead) ||~ To || Thomas Graham (Site-17 Director)||
||||||||Excellent; the new package should be arriving soon via plane(s); hope your landing pad is still usable. Truly been a pleasure, Mr. Graham.||
