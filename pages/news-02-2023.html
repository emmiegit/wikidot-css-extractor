The 2023 International Collaboration Contest hosted by SCP-INT was completed just a few days ago! There were some bumps in the road along the way, but we have made it to the other side of another International Contest. As someone who dabbles with contests myself, there is certainly trial and error involved. So, here is hoping for an even better contest in the future!

**Congratulations to the top three** (with a tie for 3rd place!):

++ The Bright List
[[/=]]

As many of you may know, the List Of Things Dr. Bright Is Not Allowed To Do At the Foundation was recently deleted by a retiring moderator. This action was not approved, and as such, the list was reinstated from a backup and placed under the &#39;Protected&#39; category of pages. This has been widely regarded as an unpopular move among many members of the community and has resulted in the redirect page being mass downvoted (At the time of writing, the redirect page has -154 votes.) as well as multiple authors removing the character Bright from their works.

But why is this happening?

In May of 2022, the Anti-Harassment team received information regarding user AdminBright engaging in harassing behavior, including &#34;Unwelcome sexual attention&#34;, &#34;pressuring sexual discussion or interaction&#34;, and &#34;requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others&#34;. This has led to many speaking out in regard to AdminBright&#39;s actions, with multiple sources corroborating the story. Ever since the discovery of these behaviors, most of the on-site community has come to very openly and publicly voice their disdain for anything relating to AdminBright.

How does the List play into it?

Well, the List included several sexual references and innuendos which were deemed to be unacceptable by staff. This resulted in the List being edited to remove all sexual references in late May 2022. However, users were still unsatisfied with this and wanted the list completely gone, claiming it was used by an abuser in order to further their goals. The anti-List sentiment continued to grow for around a year, with users stating they would like to see the list deleted, until February 19th, 2023, when the List was deleted.

And what then?

The re-uploaded List was placed under &#39;Protected&#39; status to prevent it from falling into deletion range, as the article was at nearly 1900 upvotes prior to its deletion. As previously mentioned, this has upset many users, leading to the current [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-15678520/discussion-bright-s-list ongoing discussion] to decide the ultimate fate of the List open to users and [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-15678517/discussion-bright-s-list staff alike]. You are welcome to voice your opinion there, if you&#39;re so inclined.

This story will be updated as updates are made available.

Works are featured on the site’s front page as part of the Reviewers’ Spotlight, which acknowledges the time and effort spent by forum reviewers helping other authors develop and edit and their works for the mainsite. Each month, community members are encouraged to nominate forum reviewers who have been both particularly helpful and active. Members of the Forum Criticism Team will then discuss the nominations, and select four prominent reviewers to choose the month’s Reviewers’ Spotlight front-page features.
