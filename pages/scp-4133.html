**Item #:** SCP-4133

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-4133 is to remain in a Safe Class storage locker at site 21.   Only D-Class personnel involved with testing are permitted to have contact with SCP-4133.  Personnel exposed to SCP-4133 are required to be administered Class A-Amnestics and undergo a psychological evaluation.  Computers in use at site 21 are to have their search engines routinely monitored.  Any searches involving combinations of the following words are to be flagged and reported.

* Blonde
* Mustang
* Silver 
* Streamline


**Description:** SCP-4133 is a copy of Custom Car Magazine dated January, 1980.  The cover consists of a Burgundy 1935 Ford Model CX Saloon and a brown haired woman wearing a leopard skin singlet.  Page 46, designated SCP-4133-1, consists of a blonde woman posing with a silver 1967 Ford Mustang. SCP-4133-1 has been found to possess cognitohazardous properties.  If exposed to SCP-4133-1, the reader will become infatuated with the woman on the page after a period of 10 minutes.  Once time has elapsed, the reader will attempt to re-visit SCP-4133-1, but become unable to locate it.  Frustrated with being unable to find SCP-4133-1, the subject will then begin a laborious search using any available means.  This includes:

* Meticulously combing every page of SCP-4133.
* Searching for other issues of Custom Car Magazine in the area to examine.
* Utilizing an internet connection to find prior and current issues of the magazine.
* Visiting the publication itself to inquire about SCP-4133-1.
* Actively searching for the woman on SCP-4133-1.

While this search is undergone, increasingly specific memories will manifest within the affected individual.  These memories are consistent in nature among all affected persons.  These include:

* The woman being a friend of their mother.
* The woman being involved in a relationship with the subject. 
* The woman being unfaithful to the subject.
* The woman stealing a silver streamline camper from the subject.

There are two known methods for quelling the effects of SCP-4133-1.  The first is the administering of Class-A Amnestics.  The second is illustrating SCP-4133-1.  Artists capable of creating a quality rendition of SCP-4133-1 have been observed under testing to be unaffected (See 4133-T-02).   

SCP-4133 was recovered after a series of incidents surrounding ██████&#39;s Tires in  █████, Ohio.  Foundation field agents were subsequently exposed to SCP-4133, resulting in similar abnormal behavior.  Independent research into the identity of the woman on SCP-4133-1 have yielded no results.  Kelsey Media, the publication responsible for Custom Car Magazine, has no record of any woman matching her description.  Additional copies of the January, 1980 issue do not feature any instances of SCP-4133-1.

**Addendum: 4133-I01** 

Transcript details an interview with affected field agent, Samuel ████.  Reported missing on ██ /██/ ████, and later located on ██ / ██ / ████

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ 4133-I01 &#34; hide=&#34;- Hide&#34;]]

&gt; **Researcher:**  Dr. Ryan  Alness
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent:**  Samuel  ████
&gt; 
&gt; **Date**:  ██ / ██ / ████
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Alness:**  You&#39;ve been reprimanded for dereliction of duty.  Can you tell me why?
&gt;  
&gt; **Agent ████:** I needed some personal leave to take care of a few things.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Alness:**  You have to make a formal request for leave.  You know that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent ████**:  If your wife cheated on you and took off with your five-thousand-dollar camper, you&#39;d do the same thing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Alness:**  According to your file, you&#39;re unmarried and have never been married. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent ████:**  Yes I am! Why does everyone keep saying that?!  It doesn&#39;t matter if she left.   We. Are. Still. Married.  We are partners.  She&#39;s my muse.  It was my artwork that got her noticed in the first place you know?  Then the photo shoots started.  She would go on and on about Hollywood, getting seen in pictures.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Alness:** You have no recreational vehicles registered in your name.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent ████**:  That&#39;s impossible.  It belonged to my father before he died and I damn near grew up in that thing.  I remember burning my hand on it on a summer day.  God, she&#39;s the worst thing that ever happened to me, I swear.  Mom really messed up the day she introduced us.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Alness:**  Can you tell me what her name is?  Maybe we can help you find her.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent ████:**  I...I...don&#39;t know.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Alness:**  You&#39;re telling me you&#39;re married to her, and you can&#39;t remember her name?  You don&#39;t find that just a little bit odd?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent ████:**  Oh, I...never...I never thought of that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Alness:**  Can you tell me about the last time you saw her?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent ████ :**  Summer I think, 1976, or 79, somewhere around there.  Caught her with her some suit and she took off in the Camino.  My Streamline was still hooked up to it.  Chased after her, but she managed to hide behind some truckers when I cornered her at a diner.  I got back and tore up everything. Every picture I painted of her, every photo of us.  I wanted every trace of her to just be gone.  
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Alness:** You were born ██/1983, so chasing around a pinup model in the mid-seventies is out of the realm of possibility.  But I&#39;m curious to know what you supposedly did after that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent ████:**  Did everything I could to find her.  And I mean everything. Even talked to a psychic who put me in contact with a guy.  Someone who could find people using alternative means.    I don&#39;t think anything ever came of it.  When he broke out the chalk and candles, you could say it was a wake up call that maybe this wasn&#39;t the way to go about things.
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Alness:**  What can you tell me about this person?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent ████:** He was like a voodoo practitioner.  Haitian.  The kind of guy you go to if you wanted to put hex on somebody, or make them fall in love with you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Alness:** And what did you ask him to do?  Be as specific as possible.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent ████:**  I asked him to bring her back.  He drew a bunch of symbols and asked me to concentrate on what I wanted.  But I couldn&#39;t keep it together.  Sometimes I wanted her to disappear, like she never existed.  Other times, I just wanted her to be happy.  I just couldn&#39;t keep it all straight.  Halfway through, I just bolted.  It was a little too weird for me if I&#39;m being honest.
&gt;

**Addendum 4133 A-01:**  //Excerpts from Testing log 4133-T//

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Testing log 4133-T &#34; hide=&#34;- Hide&#34;]]


&gt; **Test Designation:  4133-T0-1**
&gt; **Name/ Personnel ID:**   Dr. Ryan Alness
&gt; **Test Subject:**  D-1601A
&gt; **Summary goal:**  To see if SCP-4133-1 is capable of being photographed.
&gt; **Parameters:**  D-1601A is instructed to view SCP-4133-1.  Once viewed, D-1601A is to use a  camera and photograph SCP-4133-1
&gt; **Results:**  Inconclusive.  Despite multiple attempts with additional D-Class personnel, every photo of SCP-4133-1 yielded a photo of an advertisement for various auto parts.

&gt; **Test Designation: 4133-T-02** 
&gt; **Name/ Personnel ID:**  Dr. Adamska Tsykovich
&gt; **Test Subject:**  D-2901C.  A former artist.
&gt; **Summary goal:**  To see if SCP-4133-1 is capable of being illustrated.
&gt; **Parameters:**  D-2901C is instructed to open SCP-4133 and illustrate SCP-4133-1.
&gt; **Results:**  Success.  The resulting artwork featured a light haired woman posing with a silver Mustang.  The work was turned in and filed in storage drawer D-1 for future study.
&gt; **Update:**  Subject D-2901C was later found to be unaffected by exposure to SCP-4133-1.  After a timed period of 30 minutes, subject did not exhibit compulsion to return to SCP-4133-1.

&gt; **Test Designation:  4133-T-03**
&gt; **Name/ Personnel ID:**  Dr. Sara Lawler
&gt; **Test Subject:**  D-1203B  
&gt; **Summary goal:**  To see if SCP-4133-1&#39;s effects will cease after being drawn by a subject with little artistic experience.
&gt; **Parameters:**  D-1203B is instructed to open SCP-4133 and sketch any images on SCP-4133-1.
&gt; **Results:**  A crude drawing of a stick figure next to an automobile.  The subject returned to SCP-4133 and subsequently demanded to know what happened to SCP-4133-1.
&gt; 
[[/collapsible]]
&gt; 
**Conclusion:**  Despite failure with photography,  the sketch proves that SCP-4133-1 exists.  Exposure to artist renditions of SCP-4133-1 yield no active effects.


**Addendum 4133-I02:**

Transcript details interview with subject D-2901C after subject complained of unusual recurring dreams.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ 4133-I02 Restricted&#34; hide=&#34;- 4133-I02 Clearance Approved&#34;]]  

&gt; **Researcher:**  Dr. Adamska Tyskovich
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewee:**  Subject D-2901C
&gt; 
&gt; **Date:** ██/ ██/ ████  
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tyskovich:**  Since drawing SCP-4133-1, how do you feel? 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-2901C**:  I feel, good.  An immense sense of relief.  I can’t explain it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tsykovich:**  It’s been █ days since the initial experiment.  You’ve reported having a recurring dream.  Can  you tell me what it was?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-2901C:**  I&#39;m driving a car down a long stretch of road.  And that woman&#39;s next to me.  Just having a conversation.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tyskovich:** And what did you two talk about?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-2901C:**  She always tells me, “Thank you.  I wanted someone to prove that I existed.  I know I’m not perfect.  Done a lot of shitty things, but I don’t deserve what happened to me.”
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tsykovich:** That&#39;s good.  It sounds like we&#39;re getting somewhere.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-2901C:**  The woman I drew. What happened to her?  
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tsykovich:**  We don&#39;t know.  We were hoping you could shed some light with this recent development.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-2901C:**  Well, I get this feeling something happened to her.  It&#39;s a weird sense of déjà vu.  Like she&#39;s supposed to be here, but she isn&#39;t. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tsykovich:**  You mean here?  At the Foundation?
&gt; 
&gt;  **D-2901C:**  Not here.  But like, here in our world.  I think that&#39;s why you can&#39;t find her.  That  page, that lady.  It&#39;s like they&#39;re supposed to exist, but they don&#39;t at the same time.  What is all this?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tsykovich:**  That concludes our interview, D-2901C.  Thank you for your time.  
&gt;
