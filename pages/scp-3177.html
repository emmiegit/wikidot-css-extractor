**Item #:** SCP-3177

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3177 is to be stored in a standard anomalous object containment locker. Level-2 clearance is required to remove SCP-3177 from its locker and allow viewing.

Should personnel unintentionally come under the effects of SCP-3177, they are to seek immediate amnestic treatment.

**Description:** SCP-3177 is a cardboard cutout of American actor Steve Buscemi standing 1.8 meters tall. SCP-3177&#39;s anomalous abilities only become relevant when a subject is able to visibly comprehend SCP-3177 after witnessing a murder. Subjects who meet these requirements believe that SCP-3177 was responsible for the murder, and report witnessing them performing the act, regardless of the means of murder.

A subject does not need to witness both the murderer and the victim, only the victim dying. A subject who witnesses a victim dying without seeing the murderer is able to recall SCP-3177 committing the act itself, regardless of any events which happened that might contradict this memory. For example, a subject who witnesses a victim being poisoned would recall SCP-3177 giving the victim poison through whichever vessel it was delivered.

Currently, no time limit has been discovered between witnessing the murder and interacting with SCP-3177, however amnestic treatment has been shown to reverse the process.

**Addendum 3177-01:**

The following interview is between Dr. Robert Douhni and D-30044, who was previously convicted for the murder of a family in █████████, Virginia.

&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Douhni:** Alright, D-30044, I have a few questions about something that happened a while back. We&#39;ve gotten word that you were present during the murder of the ████ family back in September of 20██?
&gt; 
&gt; //D-30044 leans back in his chair.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-30044:** Oh, yes, yes... Fucking hated those greedy wastes of space.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Douhni:** Obviously not a fan then, I see. If you could remain as impartial as you could when describing what happened? It&#39;d... it&#39;s going to make it easier for me, personally.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-30044:** Oh, of course. If you want to know what happened, it starts with an interesting coincidence; I was actually about to kill them myself, if you&#39;d believe it. I had everything prepped and ready for the fun I was about to have. Intended to blow the brains out of that preppy kid first and then torture the old fucks before finally ending their lives.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Douhni:** You seemed to have quite the plan already. Why didn&#39;t you go through with it?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-30044:** Well, if you&#39;d believe it, that man that you introduced me to earlier? He was already there! Just as I was about to take aim at the kid with the shotgun //I// brought, he just pulled out his own shotgun and killed him before I could even pull the trigger!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Douhni:** The cardboard cutout?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-30044:** Yes! I didn&#39;t believe it myself when I first saw it, and honestly I was a bit upset that he got the shot off first. He didn&#39;t pay me much mind when I went over and unloaded a few more rounds into that man-child&#39;s corpse to make sure he was dead, so that much I appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Douhni:** Mhm...
&gt; 
&gt; //Dr. Douhni is seen quietly writing on his clipboard before turning his attention back to D-30044.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Douhni:** Right, sorry. Can you continue?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-30044:** Of course. As I was saying, I don&#39;t know where he went next, but he didn&#39;t get in the way when I went upstairs and tied up the parents. I had this whole routine practiced, this speech about greed and entitlement and how much pain they&#39;ve inflicted on me and all the other people of █████████. Each cut was supposed to be symbolic, one cut for every person who was suffering beneath their boots.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Douhni:** I can&#39;t personally relate, but, um...
&gt; 
&gt; //Dr. Douhni coughs into his hand.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Douhni:** I, I think I understand what you were trying to go for.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-30044:** Yes, so, I got to work. I cut their tongues out first so they couldn&#39;t scream, then I sawed off the fingers and toes in case they tried to escape. Then... I&#39;m sorry, did you want the details? I can go through the whole routine. I still have the speech memorized.
&gt; 
&gt; //D-30044 is seen smiling to himself. Dr. Douhni is seen covering his mouth with his hands.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Douhni:** Please, do not go into specific detail, for my sake personally.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-30044:** Of course, my apologies. So, just as I&#39;m about the finish the job, //he// comes back into the room. Out of nowhere he&#39;s there, and he looks just as angry at these people as I was. I figured I had my fun, so I offered him the knife. He took it gladly and just slashed their throats open, let &#39;em bleed out. I was impressed, truly I was. A slow, excruciating death choking on their own blood was what they deserved. Then he simply gave me back the knife and left.
&gt; 
&gt; //Dr. Douhni lowers his hands and picks up his pencil to write again.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Douhni:** It just killed them and left? Did you see where it went?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-30044:** Sadly no. Shame though, I was the one arrested for it. I didn&#39;t even kill them, technically. But hey, at least you all found a way to lock him up, hm?
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Incident 3177-██:**

[[collapsible show=&#34;ENTER LEVEL-4 CREDENTIALS TO ACCESS&#34; hide=&#34;ACCESS GRANTED&#34;]]

On September 28th, 20██, a large portion of Site-██ was destroyed due to what was believed to be a fault in the heating system. This resulted in the temporary breach of multiple anomalies, as well as the deaths of ██ Foundation personnel. While interviewing a survivor of the accident, they reported witnessing SCP-3177 planting a high-grade explosive in the [REDACTED] wing of the facility.

Investigations regarding the incident are ongoing.
