**Containment Procedures:** Due to SCP-7757&#39;s influence being restricted to Site-⌘ personnel by nature, no significant actions are to be taken in response. The spread of information about SCP-7757 is to remain limited to Site-⌘ personnel exclusively. Any individuals that do not meet that criteria and are found to possess knowledge of SCP-7757 are to be detained at Site-⌘. 

&#34;Steven Y. Hayes&#34; is to remain on the Telecommunications Monitoring Office&#39;s list of keywords. Any request by non-Site-⌘ personnel seeking the meaning of this term are to be denied.

**He does not exist, and never did. Do not search for him, your efforts will prove fruitless.**

**Description:** SCP-7757 is the general consensus among staff at Site-⌘ that a researcher by the name of Steven Y. Hayes, referred to here on out as SCP-7757-1, was at some point employed by the Foundation, despite no record of any personnel under that name. **He does not exist, and never did. Do not search for him, your efforts will prove fruitless.** Site-⌘ staff under the influence of SCP-7757[[footnote]]~9/8 of total Site-⌘ staff.[[/footnote]] will typically attribute the following characteristics to this supposed entity:

- SCP-7757-1 is male.

- He is 1.9 meters tall.

- He has short brown hair, blue eyes, and pale complexion.

- He is originally from Sofia, Bulgaria.

- He was Site-⌘&#39;s director of Intangible Anomalous Applications (IAA).

- He was hired by the Foundation in 1998.

- He is quite reclusive.

- He is quite fond of chess, though not particularly good at the game.

- He mysteriously disappeared at some point in mid-2019.

Other details are often included as well, though with significantly less consistency.

In an attempt to prove the existence of SCP-7757-1, staff will often try to procure photographs to show the unconvinced, despite --no-- only one piece--s-- of media depicting SCP-7757-1 having been successfully recovered. **He does not exist, and never did. Do not search for him, your efforts will prove fruitless.**

Stories pertaining to interactions with SCP-7757-1 are often brought up by those affected by the anomaly, which can often be corroborated by other affected personnel. The abundance of shared conceptions and memories of SCP-7757-1 have led researchers to believe the entity has a presence in the localized noosphere of Site-⌘, though this hypothesis has yet to be proven. 

Amnestic and mnestic agents have been shown to have no effect on SCP-7757.

**Addendum 7757.1 - Interviews:**

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
Interviewer: Sr. Researcher B. Randall
Interviewed: Dr. Thom Evans

------

[BEGIN LOG]

**B. Randall:** Now, Thom, could you please tell me a bit about your experiences with 7757-1?

**Dr. Evans:** Oh, Steve? He was great, man. Really funny, too. If you had joined the team a few years back, you two would&#39;ve got along damn well. 

**B. Randall:** Do any interactions stand out?

**Dr. Evans:** We went fishing once. He was like, really good at it. It was, I wanna say a bonding exercise. Dave probably set it up. You know Dave, always tryna get us to do things outside of work. He caught a few salmon before a time loop caught up to us. We dealt with that though. Nothing too in of the ordinary.  

**B. Randall:** What makes this moment stand out?

**Dr. Evans:** Well I didn&#39;t really talk to him that much to be honest. He was always holed away in his office. Room 19½[[footnote]]Though plans to make a Room 19½ have been made, they have not yet come to fruition.[[/footnote]], if my memory serves me well. Up until that point, I don&#39;t even think I had had a full conversation with the guy. That day, though, he truly got out of his comfort zone. Lovely guy, really. I have some photos if you wanna see.

[Evans reaches under the floor, grabbing his smartphone. He opens the photo app, but finds no images depicting SCP-7757-1. **He does not exist, and never did. Do not search for him, your efforts will prove fruitless.**] 

**Dr. Evans:** Jeez, I swore I had a couple of pictures from that day. Shame.

[The smartphone disintegrates into a pile of gray dust, which Evans promptly puts in his coat pocket.]

**B. Randall:** What did he look like?

**Dr. Evans:** Brown hair, kind of slicked back. Gray-blue eyes. Not that much taller than you. Whiter than garlic. Always wore a lab coat with olive khakis; at least, that&#39;s all I ever saw him in. He was nearing sixty last time I saw him, but didn&#39;t look it. Kind of a baby face. No beard. No graying in his hair. Nothing.

**B. Randall:** What did he do?

**Dr. Evans:** Like, job-wise?

**B. Randall:** Yes.

**Dr. Evans:** Jeez, I don&#39;t really remember too well. I think it must have been something about applied surrealism. I remember him doing a lot of work with stuff we couldn&#39;t sense. I sat in on one of his meetings with that ghost we have in Site-⌘. Kind of a one-sided conversation to be honest.

**B. Randall:** Anything else you&#39;d like to say about him before this ends?

**Dr. Evans:** He didn&#39;t like eggs too much.

**Interviewer:** Sr. Researcher B. Randall
**Interviewed:** Tom Wilkins

[BEGIN LOG]

**B. Randall:** What was your relationship with SCP-7757-1?

**Wilkins:** I don&#39;t know what you are talking about.

**B. Randall:** Does &#34;Steven Y. Hayes&#34; ring any bells?

**Wilkins:** Oh that guy. Yeah, I know him. What ever happened to him?

**B. Randall:** I am not able to disclose that information.

**Wilkins:** //In a mocking voice// Oh we can&#39;t tell the janitor anything, even though he was a bloody senior researcher back at site-152. He wouldn&#39;t understand what we do here.

**B. Randall:** This has nothing to do with your position.

**Wilkins:** Yeah right.

**B. Randall:** Are we going to get through this, or do you want to go back to cleaning up that fractal in the hallway?

[Silence.]

**B. Randall:** That&#39;s what I thought. Now, what was he like?

**Wilkins:** Steve? I can&#39;t really say too much about him. He told me when there was a parallel universe clogged in the toilet sometimes, but beyond that we didn&#39;t really talk too much. He was always in that office on the second //real// floor. I never had to do much cleaning there, he tended to keep it tidy. I do remember that he had a mini-fridge with some really nice wine in it. There was also that chessboard that kinda freaked me out. I don&#39;t know why... something about it. 

**B. Randall:** What did he look like? 

**Wilkins:** Clean-shaven, brown hair, pretty tall. That&#39;s about all I remember.

**B. Randall:** Any notable interactions?

**Wilkins:** Not many. The only one I can really think of was that time that he stood in the corner of that meeting room during an anticonference. He didn&#39;t say anything, just kept staring at the ceiling. He looked terrified. I asked him what was up. He just said &#34;Nothing.&#34; Not in a dismissive way or anything; he seemed genuine. Come to think of it, that was probably the last time I really remember seeing him.

**B. Randall:** Interesting. Anything else?

**Wilkins:** Not really.

**B. Randall:** Okay. Now go clean up that fractal. I nearly fell into it this morning.

**Addendum 7757.2 - Recording:** On October 52, 2021, a video of an entity matching all known descriptors of SCP-7757-1 was found in Site-⌘&#39;s media folder. The video was dated to July 5th, 2019, with no source being available. The following is a transcription of that video file, which has not been attached due to potential memetic hazards.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
[SCP-7757-1 sits at a table, playing a game of chess on a magnetic board in front of him]

**SCP-7757-1:** I&#39;ll warn you, I have been practicing since we last played.

**Unknown Voice:** Yeah? You finally learn a real opening?

**//e4//** 

**SCP-7757-1:** e4? You&#39;re just as basic as I remember.

**//e5//**

**Unknown Voice:** If it ain&#39;t broke.

**//Knight f3//**

**SCP-7757-1:** //sarcastically// How innovative!

**//Knight c6//**

[Silence]

**//Bishop c4//**

**Unknown Voice:** You&#39;re not real, ya&#39; know.

**//Knight f6//**

**SCP-7757-1:** I&#39;ve worked here long enough to know that nothing is real.

**//Knight g5//**

**Unknown Voice:** You know that&#39;s not what I mean.

**//d5//**

**SCP-7757-1:** I don&#39;t know anything.

**//exd5//**

**Unknown Voice:** True.

**//Knight xd5//**

**SCP-7757-1:** Well what //do// you mean?

**//Knight xf7//**

**Unknown Voice:** You don&#39;t exist.

**//King xf7//**

**SCP-7757-1:** I&#39;m sorry?

**//Queen f3+//** 

**Unknown Voice:** This world around you, what you see, it&#39;s not real.

**//King e6//**

[SCP-7757-1 turns to the wall, which has become slightly translucent.]

**//knight c3//**

**SCP-7757-1:** What the fuck?

**//knight e7//** 

**Unknown Voice:** You&#39;ve spent your whole world working what&#39;s real. Crazy to think that you&#39;re not, right?

**//O-O//**

[Silence.]

**//d4//**

**SCP-7757-1:** I...

**//King d6//**

**Unknown Voice:** You are merely a figment of someone else&#39;s mind.

**//Bishop g5//** 

**SCP-7757-1:** Simulation theory...

**//Bishop e6//** 

**Unknown Voice:** Not quite. 

**//Rook fe1//** 

[Silence.]

**//exd4//**

**SCP-7757-1:** But I have consciousness! 

**//Knight e4+//**

**Unknown Voice:** Do you?

**//King c7//**

[Silence.]

**//Queen g3+//**

**SCP-7757-1:** Who are you?

**//King b6//** 

**Unknown Voice:** It doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;m less real than you.

**//Queen b3+//**

**SCP-7757-1:** Why are you telling me this now?

**//King c7//**

**Unknown Voice:** Because you are ready. 

**//Queen g3+//**

**SCP-7757-1:** For what?

**//king b6//**

**Unknown Voice:** Oblivion.

**//knight d6//** 

[SCP-7757-1 is trembling.]

**//Queen d7//**

**Unknown Voice:** You&#39;ve served your purpose. You were good for what you were, you&#39;re just no longer required. This story can go on without you.

**//a4//**

[Silence.]

**//a5//** 

[Silence.]

**//Queen e5//**

[Silence.]

**//Knight g6//**

**SCP-7757-1:** //timidly// What happens now?

**//Queen xd4+//**

**Unknown Voice:** Absolutely nothing.

**//c5//**

**SCP-7757-1:** What do you mean?

**//Queen d3//** 

**Unknown Voice:** It&#39;s done. This is it. You&#39;re gone. You&#39;ll feel nothing, see nothing, hear nothing, think nothing. A soulless, formless, mindless, nonentity, floating in the seas of Aether.

**//Queen xd6//**

**SCP-7757-1:** Is there anything I can do?

**//Rook ad1//**

**Unknown Voice:** Nothing can&#39;t do much. I&#39;d say you have a day left of reality, or more accurately, the lack thereof.

**//h6//** 

[Silence.]

**//Rook xe6//**

**SCP-7757-1:** I&#39;ve spent years studying that which doesn&#39;t make sense. I&#39;ve devoted my life to the absurd. I&#39;ve looked right at what isn&#39;t real...

**//Queen xe6//**

**Unknown Voice:** A fitting end, isn&#39;t it?

**//Bishop xd5//** 

[Silence.]

**//Queen d6//**

[Silence.]

**//Queen b3+//**

[Silence.]

**//King a7//** 

[Silence.]

**//Queen xb7#//** 

**Unknown Voice:** Checkmate.

[SCP-7757-1 reaches his hand out in front of him for a handshake with his opponent, but no one sits at the other end of the table. The only thing in front of him is a mirror. There is no reflection.]
