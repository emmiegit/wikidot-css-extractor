    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>An antimeme is //an idea with self-censoring properties//; an idea which, by its intrinsic nature, discourages or prevents people from spreading it.

**Antimemes are real.** Think of any piece of information which you wouldn&#39;t share with anybody, like passwords, taboos and dirty secrets. Or any piece of information which would be difficult to share even if you tried: complex equations, very boring passages of text, large blocks of random numbers, and dreams...

But anomalous antimemes are another matter entirely. How do you contain something you can&#39;t record or remember? How do you fight a war against an enemy with effortless, perfect camouflage, when you can never even know that you&#39;re at war?

Welcome to the Antimemetics Division.

No, this is not your first day.

++ Precursor work

These articles aren&#39;t specifically part of the main Antimemetics Division storyline above, but they influenced its development in various ways.

* [[[scp-033|SCP-033]]] by Mulciber. SCP-3125 has a close connection to this number.
* [[[revenants|Revenants]]] by [[[photosynthetics-personnel-file|Photosynthetic]]]. Like //There Is No Antimemetics Division//, this uses [[[scp-055|SCP-055]]] as a launching point, but takes it in a different direction.
* **[[[scp-1425|SCP-1425]]] by Silberescher**. This was a massive influence on the writing of //[[[unforgettable-that-s-what-you-are|Unforgettable, That&#39;s What You Are]]]//, //[[[ojai|Ojai]]]//, and all of it really.
* [[[scp-2828|SCP-2828]]] by ooblex. One of the earliest antimemetic SCPs outside of SCP-055, later referenced in //[[[case-colourless-green|CASE COLOURLESS GREEN]]]//.
* [[[scp-2358|SCP-2358]]] by [[[cocoa-s-author-page|HotCocoaNerd]]]. Introduces the Counterconceptual Division, later referenced several times in //What the Dead Know//.

++ Further reading
