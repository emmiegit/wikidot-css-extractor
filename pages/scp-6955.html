**Item #:** SCP-6955

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the very limited possibility of an unexpected SCP-6955 event, access to the surrounding area is currently unrestricted. Testing requires a perimeter to be set up with a 250m radius from the epicentre, although civilian intrusion is considered unlikely. Marvin Grimmer and Elias Dunn have agreed to participate fully in experimentation.

**Description:** SCP-6955 is a phenomenon that occurs in a clearing in Rivington Forest, Bolton, UK. Two requirements must be fulfilled for an event to occur:

* The time of day is no earlier than dusk and no later than dawn.
* Both Marvin Grimmer and Elias Dunn are present within the clearing.

When these conditions take place, the clearing will be completely inaccessible to other humans. A feeling of overwhelming dread, anxiety and paranoia has affected all people who have tried to enter or see into the clearing, as well as a sensation of being watched. The severity is enough that they universally prove unwilling to continue, even under threat of termination of contract.

Similarly, attempts to observe the clearing using surveillance equipment fail, with images and audio heavily distorted. On very rare occasions, blurred and indistinct figures can be seen blocking the bulk of the frame, and faint voices can be heard. The origin for both anomalies is unknown, and as of time of writing no attempts to clean up any footage has succeeded.

Therefore, all information regarding the details of SCP-6955 events has come from the eyewitness testimonies of Marvin Grimmer and Elias Dunn. They describe no apparent discrepancies between the clearing at such times and the clearing as normal, although it is believed a slight time dilation effect is present, with Grimmer and Dunn professing to spending more time within than passed outside. Their connection with SCP-6955 is uncertain.

**Addendum 3:** Interview log

&gt; **Interviewed:** Marvin Grimmer, Elias Dunn
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Researcher Farnsworth
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Preliminary background interview.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** And we&#39;re recording. Good afternoon, Mr. Grimmer, Mx. Dunn. Are you both comfortable?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Grimmer:** Uh, yes, sir.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dunn:** Fine, thanks.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Good. Now, if we could get started, I&#39;d very much like to know how long you two have known each other.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Grimmer:** About, uh, eight months? //[he turns to Dunn, who nods]// Yeah, at the start of the year. Well, not the //start// start of the year, like, the start of the uni year, we go to the same uni - University of Bolton, that is, although you probably knew that if you&#39;re the government or men in black or whatever -
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Alright, yes, thank you. Would you say you&#39;re close?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Grimmer and Dunn glance at each other.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dunn:** Well, define &#34;close.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Grimmer:** We get on fine, xe always lets me steal xyr notes -
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dunn:** I keep telling him they&#39;re all online.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Grimmer:** - that was how we met, actually, we&#39;re doing a postgrad, Masters in Clinical Practice, and I was, like, half an hour late on the first do, not my fault, the only seat left was next to Elias, xe filled me in on what I missed in the break.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dunn:** Yeah. Then I couldn&#39;t hear a word of the second half over your yammering.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** You do surprise me. Okay, er, how did you discover the Rivington anomaly?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Grimmer:** Well -
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** //Mx. Dunn,// please.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Grimmer appears put out, folding his arms. Dunn looks away, failing to hide a smirk.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dunn:** We went with a few friends after the winter exams were done. Celebrate with a few beers, you know.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Grimmer:** We would&#39;ve cleaned up after ourselves, like!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dunn:** We - yeah, uh, anyway, we were there for about half an hour before Marv wanted to swan off to our clearing, and -
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Sorry - //your// clearing?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dunn:** Well, uh... Sorry, Mr. Farnsworth, I think this is Marv&#39;s.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Grimmer:** You //fuck//.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dunn:** Why are you so mean to me?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Grimmer:** I&#39;m not!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dunn:** Happy enough to talk any other time.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Grimmer:** Like you don&#39;t shut me up any other time.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dunn:** Oh, and how exactly would you like me to shut you up?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Grimmer:** I can think of - //[he stops abruptly, glancing at Farnsworth]// Sorry, this probably isn&#39;t...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Farnsworth is leaning back in his chair, massaging his temples with one hand.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** No, by all means, in your own time.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Grimmer:** Oh, good, thanks. So - //[Dunn quietly snickers; Grimmer ignores xyr]// I grew up here, and my mum and dad used to say that Rivington Forest was haunted. Like, proper Scooby Doo ghosts.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dunn:** Scooby Doo ghosts were just old guys in masks.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Grimmer:** You know what I mean. Anyway, they were probably just trying to put me off going there, but one day I got into a blazing row with them, I don&#39;t even remember why. I was eighteen, decided I was gonna leave Bolton forever, and I left with a bag packed and everything. Dunno why I went to the forest, maybe just one more way to spite them. Stumbled around aimlessly for a bit until I found the clearing, and it was... quiet.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dunn:** Which he wasn&#39;t used to.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Grimmer:** I know you&#39;re probably taking the piss but, like, genuinely. There was always something, telly or music or whatever. I never knew how nice actual peace and quiet was. I mean, it wasn&#39;t //silent//, there were birds and wind and traffic noises and stuff, but that didn&#39;t count, because I was alone. I liked being alone.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dunn:** And when I told him I was... well, gender. It&#39;s a nightmare, I didn&#39;t know what to do. I don&#39;t know if you -
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth** Oh, believe me, I get it.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dunn:** Really? //[xe smiles]// Huh. Because I came out to him, and I said I didn&#39;t know where to go, and he told me about this place he went when he needed to be alone. We&#39;d go there, and we&#39;d bring snacks, and we&#39;d smuggle clothes and stuff for me to try, and we&#39;d talk. Or, y&#39;know, not. And we&#39;d be alone together. //[xe smiles slightly at Grimmer]// Sorry you don&#39;t have your alone spot anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Grimmer:** I always feel alone with you.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dunn:** Aw, that&#39;s... sweet? I think?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Grimmer:** Well, it was //meant// -
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Okay, that&#39;s enough! We&#39;re done here, thank you both.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;END LOG&gt;**

**Addendum 7:** An early test regarding an SCP-6955 event involved providing handheld cameras to Grimmer and Dunn, before triggering the event. Additionally, a Whitaker-Doyle Spectregraph[[footnote]]An experimental prototype recording device. Originally designed to pick up otherwise undetectable communications from spectral entities, it was theorised that it would enhance the voices heard in SCP-6955 recordings.[[/footnote]] was employed, slightly outside the usual area of effect.

As soon as the event began, Foundation personnel experienced an overwhelming feeling that they were being watched, despite apparently being out of range. The anxiety induced several panic attacks; one staff member fled the scene, and was recovered the next day. The event concluded after ninety-four minutes.

Both recording devices inexplicably failed to operate. However, the Spectregraph decoded a brief portion of the voices it recorded; the message, as displayed on the device&#39;s screen, read as follows:

&gt; NOT NICE IS IT
&gt; 
&gt; LET THEM KISS IN PEACE, YOU NOSY TWATS

Grimmer and Dunn displayed signs of physical exertion upon their return. Both were reluctant to discuss this any further.</textarea></pre>
