**Item #:** SCP-7394-J

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7394-J is to be kept in a small box in Janitorial Assistant James&#39;s closet, who will tweet every time SCP-7394-J lets rip a hilarious one. Janitorial Assistant James is to use the hashtag [https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23keterfrogfarts&amp;src=hash #keterfrogfarts].

**Description:** SCP-7394-J is a small tree frog (species unknown) with the ability to [DATA EXPUNGED], causing massive internal bleeding and psychological trauma in subjects caught within a 2 kilometer radius of SCP-7394-J. Approximately 259 deaths have been traced back to SCP-7394-J.

This effect is overshadowed, however, by SCP-7394-J&#39;s hilarious ability to fart whenever it hops. Researchers have concluded that this fucking beast just won&#39;t stop letting them rip, and SCP-7394-J has been a major hit at almost every party. It is pretty much the funniest thing you&#39;ll ever see. Just trust researchers on this.

Although certain recommendations towards creating stricter containment have been voiced, these have been downplayed in favour of increasing exposure to SCP-7394-J&#39;s humorous gaseous melodies. Personnel voicing these precautions obviously have no sense of humor and if they would just watch SCP-7394-J farting at least once, researchers hypothesize they&#39;ll finally understand why this is so fucking entertaining.

**Addendum 7394-J-1:** Incident log (Abridged due to length):

██/██/████: SCP-7394-J breaches containment from Site-44. 21 personnel casualties, 3 civilian. Nuclear failsafe deployed following breach of SCP-████, SCP-████ and SCP-███. Last message from Site-44: &#34;Did this really loud beer fart. We all lost our shit.&#34;

██/██/████: SCP-7394-J lets out &#34;silent but deadly&#34; fart. Hilarity ensued. ██ personnel left permanently disabled.

██/██/████: A ceasefire is called at Site-██ during an attack by Chaos Insurgents, in order to allow the insurgents to hear SCP-7394-J. Insurgents later admitted &#34;that was all we really came to do. It lived up to all our expectations.&#34; Fighting resumed, resulting in ██ estimated casualties.

██/██/████: SCP-7394-J breached containment, and managed to enter the site cafeteria. It subsequently began to consume a plate of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-666-and-a-half-j SCP-666½-J] while it was located there. The result of this incident has been deemed a memetic hazard, and has not been transcribed here, and [[[SCP-2000]]] was activated shortly after. However, Janitorial Assistant James describes the incident as &#34;10 Gulf War oil spills, with each drop of oil being imbued with pure uranium. The fart was still hilarious though. #apollyonfrogfarts&#34;
