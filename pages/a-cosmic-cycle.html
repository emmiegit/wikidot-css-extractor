Clark, 
I&#39;ve attached the files and excerpts you&#39;ve requested below. It isn&#39;t a lot but given the amount of time I had, I&#39;d say it&#39;s enough to get a good glimpse at the Cosmos for whatever it is you&#39;re doing. I&#39;ve attached some notes of mine to the electronic version of the documents, but some of them are missing from this set. If you have any problems, you know how to contact me.

P.S: You like the way the old memos look? I managed to get ahold of one and I&#39;m tryna convince people they&#39;re still usable. I also put some footnotes incase you need a little background info. Call me later and we can talk about it some.

&gt; We at ##purple|Arcadia## are saddened to hear about the recent termination of your employment at Atari Inc. and wish to express our sincere condolences for this unfortunate event. It is always hard to see someone we admire and respect greatly to be mistreated. We are proud of our commitment to making our business a family endeavor - all of ##purple|Arcadia## works in tandem, like a family, to deliver quality entertainment and innovative technology to the masses. ##purple|Arcadia## is dedicated to our employees, we offer numerous benefits to our hard workers, and guarantee employee satisfaction. Following a review of your employment history, medical records, legal documents, affiliation with competitors, family relations, and financial history, we have decided to contact you with the hopes of requesting that you meet with us on January 9th, 1982 - this coming Saturday - to discuss the potential for your employment as a member of ##purple|Arcadia&#39;s## ever-growing family. Please contact us via phone to confirm your attendance.

&gt; 1. History of Development of the Product. 
&gt; Development of the product began in April, 1982, following the assignment of Mr. Allan Alcorn to a small team previously engaged in the development of coin-op machines. Work proceeded smoothly throughout the following months - please see the attached memorandums for further information on development during this period. A finalized design was agreed upon in August of the same year, although protests from Mr. Alcorn significantly hindered progress on this decision. Development of the hardware for the system began in November of this year, and is currently underway. 
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; 2. Finalized Decisions on Hardware.
&gt; Following an internal discussion by the Cosmos Development Team, a final decision on the hardware of the system was made. It was determined that the initial design of the Cosmos that Mr. Alcorn had brought to our attention, could be significantly improved if major changes were made. Mr. Theodore Wilkins[[footnote]] Wilkins left ##purple|Arcadia## in &#39;89, left a note on his desk and just stopped showing up to work. I met him a few times when I got here in &#39;88.[[/footnote]], who previously was working on the ##purple|Arcadian## Projector[[footnote]] I&#39;ve never heard of any &#39;Projector&#39;, if I had to guess I&#39;d assume it was another one of the crazy ideas cooked up by the R&amp;D teams.[[/footnote]] (See Section 3.) recommended that Mr. Alcorn contact the appropriate office to request the use of the Projector in the Cosmos. A request was filed with the appropriate office, and has since been granted. It was determined that, instead of creating the illusion of a three dimensional image through the use of holographic technology, the ##purple|Arcadian## Projector is able to be used to project multiple three dimensional images into a three dimensional space, such as a small room. The Development Team has since set out to discover how to best utilize the device in a way that allows for interactive entertainment in a small living room.
&gt; @@ @@ 
&gt; 3. ##purple|Arcadian## Projector.
&gt; The ##purple|Arcadian## Projector is a miniaturized projector which can project two dimensional images into a three dimensional space as three dimensional objects. Through the use of the B.M.C.C.[[footnote]] The &#39;Bushnell Motion Circuit Connector&#39;, some kinda conduit to the underworld.[[/footnote]] (See: &#34;The B.M.C.C And You: an ##purple|Arcadian## Guide to Connections with Hell&#34;[[footnote]] An apt name, I remember being given this book in &#39;93 as a birthday gift. It&#39;s pretty funny, definitely feels like something Nolan would&#39;ve been involved in.[[/footnote]] for more information), the Projector is able to utilize Kay Particles[[footnote]] &#39;Kay Particles&#39;, or as I like to call it, &#39;Hellnergy&#39; is just fancy talk for energy extracted from Hell. Cool in concept, boring in reality.[[/footnote]] to product this effect. Reports of interference by entities not approved by ##purple|Arcadia## are currently being investigated, and the relevant reports can be requested from the appropriate department.

&gt; My Dear Friend Allan, 
&gt; 
&gt; It is always unfortunate when a member of our family is unable to achieve his dreams. When a  truly visionary idea is unable to pass the rigors of development. It is quite sad, truly, to hear that a  beloved member of the ##purple|Arcadian## family must go his own way.
&gt; Life, however, continues and I write to you today with a request, from a friend. 
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I have something to show you Allan.
&gt; You know where to find me. 
&gt; 
&gt; Your Friend, //Nolan Bushnell.//[[footnote]] Bushnell shouldn&#39;t have been involved //at all// with ##purple|Arcadia## at this point. This was &#39;84, so it&#39;s possible he&#39;s just sayin&#39; shit to get Alcorn to meet with him. [[/footnote]]
