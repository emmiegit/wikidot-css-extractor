Hi there everybody! I’m Merehrab[[footnote]]Pronounced Meh-ray-hrab, not meer-hrab. If I hear someone actually say the latter out loud, I will cringe so hard that I’ll pop a blood vessel.[[/footnote]] (he/him), and I have been reading articles on this wiki since 2020, and have been trying to write articles here since February 2022 (well, my first account that is. My current account is actually my second account, which was made in August of that year). I like Lord of the Rings, I like to read contemporary fantasy and science fiction novels, and I’m also a huge fan of the SCP wiki and all of its lore, which is obvious considering I’ve written stuff for it.

The stuff I like to write is mostly character-driven, kind of long, sometimes slice-of-life, and sometimes I like to write some emotional articles as well. But what I really like to write are the hopeful stories. Hope to me is not some delicate, ephemeral thing made of whispers and spider’s webs. Hope has been knocked to the ground several times, with dirt on her face and blood on her knuckles, and she spats out a tooth and rises to another go anyway. It’s like David and Goliath, with Goliath being the unstoppable evil that will take down anything in its path, and hope being just a little thing, who looks out for others and rises to the challenge no matter how great. It only takes a single match to start a fire. Those are the kind of stories I really like to write for the wiki.

Of course, I also want to expand on what I want to write and do many things. I want to write for some canons that I really like, I want to write tales, I want to write articles that’ll scare people, I want to do many things. And I hope that I’ll get to check off all the things I want to do. 

It’s been a lot of fun reading and writing for this wiki, and I am very grateful for all the support that I have received while being here. I’ve read many great articles written by fantastic authors, big and small, and I can’t wait to see what everyone cooks up next.

But first, a few words from some other authors.

[[[SCP-7550]]] - Dungeons and Demons

[[collapsible show=&#34;Author Commentary&#34; hide=&#34;Collapse&#34;]]

Ah, my first article. Now this one’s a fun one.

I formed the idea of this one while in high school, and I was a big fan of D&amp;D at the time[[footnote]]Still am now, but not as much as I used to be. I haven’t watched any D&amp;D web series in a long time, and I still have never played the actual game myself[[/footnote]], and I used to watch Critical Role religiously. I just watched a lot of 3 hour vods of that series on YouTube every day. And at the time in high school while I was reading SCPs, I didn’t even know that there were actual people writing these things. And once I figured it out that there were actual authors, I knew then that I had to write one, just so I could. Because I always loved the SCP wiki and the stories that it tells, and actually writing an SCP would’ve been an accomplishment that I would always be proud of myself for. 

So I formed an idea. It was dumb. It was basically “what if the Matthew Mercer from Critical Role that we knew was actually a demon the entire time?” Well, part of it was that. And I have the original idea right here for all to see. Here it is:

**Elevator Pitch:** An online D&amp;D game gone horribly wrong. It has cognitohazardous influence in its advertising, a demonic DM, and players who are forced to play the game for eternity. If their characters die, the players die as well.

**Central Narrative:** Foundation webcrawlers discover an anomalous advertisement on Roll20.net, where the ad forces players into joining an online D&amp;D game. Once they join the game, instead of getting an invite to join a discord server or other online service, the players get sent into a hell dimension, where they meet the DM, who is a demonic entity who calls itself Xornos. Xornos hates the current climate of D&amp;D, and wants to improve on its DM skills by kidnapping players from lots of different dimensions and forcing them to play his homebrew campaign.

The Foundation then send D-Class to this dimension with hidden audio recorders in order to find out how the campaign works. The campaign is just your average campaign, except for the fact that if your characters die during the game, the players will die the same way as their characters. For example, if a character dies by getting stabbed multiple times by different weapons, the same exact weapons described by Xornos materialize in front of the player and move by themselves to maim and kill the player. The player’s remains then disappear. The players cannot escape, and they are forced to play for eternity. Once Xornos says that the campaign is officially finished, the players get sent back to their home realities, and a new campaign gets made.

The Foundation then try to infiltrate the dimension using many resources. These methods do not work, because the dimension is impenetrable. Xornos finds out about these methods, and then kidnaps many Foundation researchers to cease the Foundation from working on how to stop it. One of the kidnapped researchers, Dr. Prescott, convinces Xornos to stop what it’s doing and join Critical Role, to improve his DM skills without causing harm to anymore people. Xornos disguises itself as Matthew Mercer, and hosts Critical Role to this day. The real Matthew Mercer is given amnestics and is sent home, and is watched by the Foundation to prevent him finding out about Critical Role.

**Hook/Attention Grabber:** D&amp;D is a really popular role-playing game that is loved by many. By adding lots of twists and turns, horrific events, and good writing, this SCP could work.

Good god. Yeah, a lot of this idea had to be reworked, and thank god I got all those people from idea crit on the forums to help me rework this, but some other parts of this made it to the final cut. Ultimately, the idea turned into a story about a Demonic DM who tries hard to be a successful DM, but due to obvious differences between himself and the players, his rules are draconian and painful, and the campaign gets heated to the point of no return. But things will get better for Xornos, in time. He just has to learn from his mistakes, albeit very slowly.

When I was writing this, it took me months to get my SCP greenlighted. It took me even longer to find someone to look at the draft. And I got only one person to look at it. I tried to get more people to critique my work, but it just wouldn’t happen. I got frustrated at myself, and I was extremely anxious about posting the SCP to the site regardless of how many people looked at it anyway, so I just quit. I deleted my account and left the site in June. Because my self-doubt got to the point where I didn’t think I would ever be able to post anything at all on the wiki. I didn’t think I was a good enough writer. 

But then in August, I decided to come back. Because after my little break I still wanted to post an SCP, and after rethinking things a whole bunch, I still thought that my D&amp;D SCP would still be able to survive. So I made another account, got my idea greenlighted again (even though I didn’t really have to), somehow got another person to look at the draft (thank you [[*user DrRevan]]), and then I just said “fuck it” and posted it on the 7550 slot, right in the middle of Anthology 2022. And it survived! I was so happy that it did. 

The next few months it slowly started to gain upvotes, until the person who originally looked at the rough draft (thank you [[*user Fireknight]]) put it on the Reviewer’s Spotlight in December. I was literally on the front page! And then after several more months, I got to the milestone of 50 upvotes. I thought I would never actually get to that point until then. And it happened because of all the support I had from the community, and I could not thank you guys enough for this. I’m still super glad that I managed to make a mark on this wiki, and made so many people’s days just a little brighter than before. 

As for the actual SCP, I still enjoy reading it from time to time, but there are some parts that are still a little unpolished to me (especially the beginning, I’m still eh about the beginning). Also, this SCP has been described as “cheesy” by someone once, which after some reflection I completely agree. If you don’t like excessive amounts of cheese in your story, this SCP might not be for you. But I don’t hate this SCP, and I still like it a lot when rereading it, regardless of all its flaws. 

Also, another cool thing is that Darnell and Tanhony read this SCP for their extremely good podcast, which I still can’t believe even happened. You can click the link to that episode [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=35FDkjHI2Aw&amp;t=233s here]. 

I’m still super proud of how much success this SCP has gotten. It means a lot to see this little SCP of mine keep on reaching new heights.

[[[SCP-7467]]] - The Green and The Mighty

[[collapsible show=&#34;Author Commentary&#34; hide=&#34;Collapse&#34;]]

This one was made for GoblinCon, but I missed the deadline so it wasn’t an actual entry for the contest. And it was also a coldpost, because of procrastination issues that I had to deal with in 2023, which hopefully will become more manageable to deal with in the future. At least it survived.

I expected this to slowly get downvoted for the next two weeks after posting, because that’s what happened to my unsuccessful SCPs that I had to quickly self-delete, because I had a problem of procrastinating on everything and doubting myself to the point of whether I was going to ever be as successful as other writers on the wiki, or if I was ever going to be a good writer at all. But this SCP somehow survived against all odds, which I was very thankful for at the time. The funny thing is that my first three SCPs were posted because I said “fuck it, we ball” and just decided to take a leap of faith, even though I was always uncertain if these SCPs would even survive. But they did.

The idea for this one came to me when I remembered the idea of a “goblin mode”, which is when someone would behave in a unapologetically self-indulgent, lazy, or messy way, and typically in a way that rejects societal norms or expectations. So basically, like a goblin. I was thinking of a way that I could use this idea for an SCP, and then out of the blue I was just like “what if I put this in a gun?”

That’s what 7467 is. It’s a weapon with three separate cartridges that have three different sets of ammunition that have three different anomalous functions. The first one changes the personality of the target to personalities that are primarily associated with the concept of a “goblin”, the second one is basically reality bending that just atomically disintegrates you, and the third one is literally just applying the Butterfly Effect in the most fatal ways possible. If you get hit by 7467 when it’s in its third function, and you make any kind of decision, there will be catastrophic consequences that will come immediately after, often resulting in your death. 

After I got the weapon down, I asked myself what kind of story I wanted to make out of this. And so I thought “why not racism against goblins?”

I don’t know how I came up with that either, but I did. And it turned out to be a decent SCP. I did enough research to make this work, and it turned out to not be a disaster, so I gave myself a pat on the back for that.

When rereading this one, I still think it’s a decent read, and there’s certainly many less rough parts than 7550, but it’s not much of a favorite of mine like the rest. Maybe you’ll enjoy it more than I do. Still, while GoblinCon was a stressful experience, it was still a lot of fun to do. Hopefully I can have better luck for future contests.

[[[SCP-7163]]] - I Will Be Here Whenever You Need Me The Most

[[collapsible show=&#34;Author Commentary&#34; hide=&#34;Collapse&#34;]]

I really like this one.

This one was my Art Exchange gift for [[*user HarryBlank]], and I absolutely had a blast writing this. Before AE, I was in a writing slump. I had a lot more negative thoughts about myself again, but I knew I always wanted to participate in an Art Exchange, and the fact that I was able to participate in one, my giftee absolutely adored my gift, and the gift then became my third successful SCP made those worries and doubts go away in an instant. I am so proud of this one, and let me tell you how I made it.

So this one started with me thinking of writing an SCP about Udo Okorie, one of my favorite characters from the On Guard 43 canon. Originally, the SCP was going to be an Alagaddan mask, and Udo was going to do research to learn more about the revelation that she had about herself while in Corbenic during the events of [[[SCP-6500]]]. The mask was going to know information about what Udo was looking for, but it’s also very mischievous and wouldn’t tell her anything while also throwing insults at her. 

I eventually realized that Harry probably already had plans about that revelation that Udo had, and I would most likely be stepping on his toes with that idea, so I scrapped it.

I then began to start looking for some images about sand sculptures, because Udo is a thaumaturgist who specializes in sand, and I thought it would be good to find an SCP that would be aligned with her specialty in sand. I eventually found the silliest looking image of a frog sculpture, which I decided to keep and use for my SCP.

I reworked my original idea to basically focus on all the important things that happened to Udo, and how she’s dealing with those behind the scenes. Basically an overview of all the tragedies and revelations about herself that she experienced, and how she’s dealing with all that. So I changed my SCP into becoming a pseudo-therapist that telepathically gives advice to personnel at Site-43 who are dealing with personal issues that are affecting them mentally. The catch is that it only does this once a year, and the Foundation never knows when it returns to give advice to the next person, since it’s all random.

Now that I had the foundations of what I wanted to do, I needed the final cherry on top to make this work. And so I randomly googled what kind of symbolism a frog has one day, and I found out that in terms of symbolism, the frog stands for growth, transformation, fertility, potential, prosperity, and harmony.

You know another character who’s associated with harmony on the wiki? Pangloss.

I had it. I had what I needed to make my SCP. And the best part is that I always wanted to write something about Pangloss for the wiki. Pangloss is a character that I’m extremely fascinated by, and when I found out a way to put him in for this SCP, I immediately took that chance.

I am also planning to write more stuff about him, so expect more Pangloss articles in the future. Maybe.

I also decided to add Dr. Ngo and Ibanez in the SCP as well, because my plot literally required them to be there, so I added them in there and called it a day.  I was also trying to figure out how to justify the interview logs, since the SCP spoke telepathically to personnel, which makes everyone else not able to hear it, then I remembered that [[[SCP-2922]]] exists, which led me to add a reference to that SCP that also made sense for the story and how the Foundation was able to transcribe the conversation between the SCP and Udo.

While writing this, I had to reread thousands upon thousands of words just to get the characters and the timeline right. I’m a continuity nut, so if I see even the tiniest misstep in a story’s timeline, I will go absolutely ballistic. That’s why I forced myself to read all of Harry’s words just to make my SCP work with the timeline that’s been already set in OG43. And ultimately it worked out perfectly, so I’m glad it did.

I think my dialogue for this one is significantly better than the previous two, which is great, because I always had a dialogue problem, and whenever I write dialogue that I thought was natural, I then would show it to other people and they say it’s not natural in the slightest. Luckily I am slowly beginning to improve on my dialogue. There’s a learning curve when it comes to writing dialogue, and I was on the slower side when I went up that curve, and still am now, but at least I’m improving! 

Ultimately, I had a lot of fun writing for this, and I am so glad that it succeeded. I would like to thank Harry once again for writing an absolutely fantastic canon that I still read to this day, and for inspiring me to help make my SCP writing dream a reality.

[[tab Stuff About Me]]

Here’s some miscellaneous stuff about me if you want to know more about me specifically, I guess.

* I’m asexual and aromantic.

* My favorite written works are the Lord of the Rings trilogy and literally anything written by Terry Pratchett.

* I am a big pasta lover. My favorite type of food is literally Italian food. I crave pasta. I’m so crazy for pasta that I’m going to go over to Italy right now and steal all the pasta there just for myself.

* I’m also a fan of the horror genre. I especially like the original Halloween movie, creepypastas in general, and the games Bendy and the Ink Machine and Alien: Isolation.

* Some music artists who I like to listen to are AJR[[footnote]]Yes, I know, I’m cringe, but at least I’m free to be happy listening to what I love, and you should too.[[/footnote]], Green Day, Weezer, Megadeth, Elton John, The Beatles, The Killers, The Darkness, Radiohead, Mumford and Sons, No Doubt, Kendrick Lamar, and a whole lot more!

* I’m a big D&amp;D fan, and a fan of the D&amp;D web series Critical Role. I still have not played an actual game of D&amp;D once in my life.

[[/tab]]

[[tab Author Will]]

In case that I am inactive from the wiki and uncontactable for longer than two years, here is what I want for my written works:

* All my SCPs that are under 25 upvotes and all my tales and GOI formats that are under 15 upvotes are to be put up for rewrite. That means that they should have the rewritable tag and anyone is allowed to rewrite the SCP or tale.

* All my co-authored works should go to their respective co-authors.

* All of my Art Exchange gifts should be given to their giftees.

Everything else should stay untouched beside SPaG fixes and licensing stuff and tags. Thank you.
