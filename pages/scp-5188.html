**Item#:** SCP-5188

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation agents in all major television networks are to monitor for SCP-5188 and prevent any broadcasts before they reach civilian audiences. While the danger to civilians presented by SCP-5188 is negligible, public acknowledgement of its anomalous qualities would lead to a potential Lifted Veil scenario.

For research purposes, one television at Site-59 is to receive and record uninhibited broadcasts of SCP-5188. Transcription efforts by research staff are ongoing.

[[[SCP-2803]]]-A is not to be made aware of Foundation suppression efforts for SCP-5188 under any circumstances. In addition, SCP-2803-A is to receive a monthly supply of forged fan mail for SCP-5188 and a &#34;royalty payment&#34; consisting two kilograms of a 50/50 blend of sand and pink glitter. [[footnote]] Due to misinformation protocols, SCP-2803-A is under the belief that this substance is called &#34;royal sturple&#34; and is the most precious form of human currency, reserved only for a handful of social elites. [[/footnote]]

**Description:** SCP-5188 is &#34;Fronglyfoot Street&#34;, an animated[[footnote]] It should be noted that the &#34;true&#34; iteration, SCP-5188-Gamma, is live-action. [[/footnote]] situation comedy produced by TotleighSoft corporation. Episodes are 22 minutes long; at time of writing, 108 episodes and nine seasons have been recorded at Site-59.

SCP-5188 makes use of TotleighSoft&#39;s signature &#34;Snoflak-o-Vizhon&#34;, a perception-altering technique that tailors the show&#39;s content to match each viewer&#39;s personal preferences for entertainment.  Despite the claim that &#34;no two [people] will see the [same show]&#34;,[[footnote]] Approximation from a //TV Guide// advertisement; original text was spelled too poorly to be precisely identified. [[/footnote]] identical transcriptions of SCP-5188 between similarly-minded researchers have been noted. Currently, the highest number of recorded variants to an individual episode (including SCP-5188-Gamma) is 57. 

The show centers around the Fronglyfoots, a family consisting of the male protagonist, his wife, their precocious two-year-old daughter, and a dog. All other factors (such as the characters&#39; names, occupations, location, financial class, supporting characters, and whether or not the dog is capable of speech) depend on the individual iteration.

In addition, viewers who possess a nerve bundle [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-2998 previously identified] as a &#34;Rosetta cluster&#34; will be immune to the perception-altering effects; the resulting show will be SCP-5188-Gamma.

+++ Addendum: Transcription Excerpt from Season 4, Episode 11, Scene 1

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The room is covered in a yellow gelatinous substance that has crystallized. &#34;Concubine&#34;^^[Wife]^^, a deceased office worker, dangles limply from the ceiling, attached by the top of her head to a tendril belonging to SCP-2803-A. She bounces up and down, speaking through unknown means.

[[=]]
CONCUBINE
I am doing a thing. I am doing a thing. 
Witness me doing this thing.
[[/=]]

&#34;Offspring&#34;^^[Daughter]^^, a small humanoid effigy made out of staplers, a disembodied cardiovascular system, and crystallized biofilm, dangles from a similar tendril toward &#34;Vassal&#34;^^[Dog, (n/a)]^^. Vassal is another dangling effigy - quadrupedal, and made from bones and computer keyboards.

(note: all characters speak in the same voice. The currently speaking character is indicated by shaking and flailing.)
[[=]]
OFFSPRING
We will partake in brief enjoyment.

VASSAL
My refusal extrudes from my mouth and
slathers negation upon your ears.

OFFSPRING
You are without permission!
[[/=]]
Vassal is dragged back and forth throughout the room, screeching.
[[=]]
OFFSPRING
I hope you did not enjoy your petulance.
[[/=]]
LORD^^[Husband]^^ enters the room. He is the former executive of the SCP-2803 compound, impaled on one of SCP-2803-A&#39;s tendrils like a finger puppet. 
[[=]]
CONCUBINE
Lord! We welcome you ambiguously.

LORD
Be silent!

CONCUBINE
I am disobedient.

LORD
Indeed. I have acquired the fruiting bodies.

CONCUBINE
For what purpose? You are well aware that
fruiting bodies do not belong in the implied
counting-house.

LORD
My ignorance is a shining, bulbous gonad. It must
be rubbed with folly over and over until
the climaxing waves of character development
wash over the area, sink, and disappear as if
they never existed. For this is what reaps
the royal sturple from the consumer and thus 
unto our God.

CONCUBINE
I tremble from how correct you are. May
your ignorance vibrate for eternity, and may
my indignace undulate in kind!

LORD
I must go, for my lucrative stupidity cannot 
reach its peak among this scenery in particular.
[[/=]]
Lord leaves.

Offspring and Vassal loudly vomit a thick black organic syrup onto the floor.
