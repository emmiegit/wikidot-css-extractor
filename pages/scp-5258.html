**Unit #:** FBG-5258

**Defense Rating:** Eligius/Argenteus[[footnote]]The Argenteus rating is an esoteric rating that signifies the prophesized end of the containment by WAN zemself.[[/footnote]]

**Fabricated Blueprints for Guarding:** FBG-5258 is guarded with a 2 km x 2 km field fenced with Mekhanium and is to be located there until the coming of WAN. The field is to be patrolled by at minimum 50 armed Archwarriors and 5 Anointed Devouts of Class III or higher. Every 24 hours, a Desolate Class prisoner is to be offered to FBG-5258 to satisfy its hunger. If FBG-5258 walks within 10 meters of the fencing at minimum 2 Archwarriors are to commence fire on FBG-5258 to deter it. In case of a breach, 3 Desolates are to be exposed to FBG-5258 to satisfy its hunger. 

**Details:** FBG-5258 is a humanoid, approximately 3 meters tall, clothed in standard garb of Known Para-Organization 001 (&#34;Children of the Flesh&#34;). FBG-5258 contains many para-abilities similar to those of other members of KPO-001, including Sarkomancy[[footnote]]The manipulation of The Flesh[[/footnote]], druidry, near indestructibility, increased regeneration, and limited polymorphy. However, FBG-5258 deviates from other members of KPO-001 due to a large parasitic being growing out of its chest, referred to as FBG-5258-Alpha. 

FBG-5258-Alpha is believed to be composed of The Flesh, but the hostility of both beings makes testing highly dangerous. FBG-5258 is believed to be controlled by FBG-5258-Alpha, along with gaining the abilities of plaguecraft and pyrokinesis from it. The parasite is believed to gain its para-natural powers from the consumption of human souls and flesh, along with them being required for its survival. Whether FBG-5258 consented to the control of FBG-5258-Alpha (or even human in the first place) is currently unknown.

**Discovery:** FBG-5258 was discovered on the 5th of Trest in the 1988th year of WAN in a cave complex underneath Kyrgyzstan. The being was contained within a stone coffin presumably built to accommodate its large size, locked with several large beryllium-infused bronze chains. The location of the cavern was discovered due to a premonition received by High Priest Vincent Mycea. In the premonition, four indistinct figures (one with a large mass on its shoulder, believed to be FBG-5258) emerge from a cavern system, similar to the one it was recovered in. Then, the Voice of WAN was heard by Mycea and said to him &#34;Go to the distant fields of Kyrgyzstan and find these servants of the Flesh, for their chains will soon break. Guard them until my coming, and you shall be seated at my right hand.&#34; Unable to ignore such commands from WAN zemself, High Priest Mycea led a Saintly Combat Patrol to the location seen. The transcript is below.

console.log (&#34;6. Though they fought with courage, SCP 89-Hephaestus was defeated by the power of The Flesh. However, it was weakened, and so Mycean channeled the power of WAN and secured the Being, which he then transported to the nearby Forge-32, before nearly succumbing to his wound.&#34;)

**Recovered Text:** Of note is that within the cavern, the wall behind the cavern was covered with an unknown selection of glyphs, resembling some proto-arabic languages. The text is currently untranslated, although a copy is listed below.
