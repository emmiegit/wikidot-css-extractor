&#34;Hello? Are you there?&#34;

&#34;Hello, this is 911. What is the nature of your emergency?&#34;

&#34;Someone&#39;s gone and put flamingos all over my lawn! I don&#39;t know how they got there, but they&#39;re there and I want them gone.&#34;

&#34;May I have your name and address please?&#34;

&#34;Arthur. Arthur Windsworth. I live at.... uhh.... well it&#39;s on 9th street. In Shady Oaks. I&#39;m sure I can give the police officers directions if you would just patch me through. These birds need to be gotten rid of I tell you!&#34;

&#34;Are you able to tell me the condition of the birds? Do they appear to be injured?&#34;

&#34;Injured? What? No, no. You don&#39;t understand. They&#39;re not //real// birds.&#34;

&#34;Not real?&#34;

&#34;Fake! Plastic birds, big great pink plastic flamingos cluttering up my lawn. Someone&#39;s put them there and I want them __gone__.&#34;

&#34;Sir, that&#39;s not exactly considered an //emergency//. The 911 hotline is reserved for use in //emergencies//.&#34;

&#34;Well I am ever so sorry, but could you at least send //someone// down? I&#39;m too //old// to be messing about in the yard trying to get at a bunch of birds that some hoodlums put in my yard.&#34;

&#34;Well Mr. Windsworth, I&#39;ll see what I can do. In the future, if you have any more problems with &#39;hoodlums&#39; please contact the police department directly to file a report.&#34;

&#34;Well.... I.... alright.&#34;

&#34;Goodbye, Mr. Windsworth.&#34;

&#34;What? Oh. Yes. Goodbye.&#34;

------

&#34;Hello?&#34;

&#34;Hello, this is 911. What is the nature of your emergency?&#34;

&#34;Oh. Yes. Well you see, I called earlier about some flamingos. I just wanted to let you all know that you don&#39;t need to send anyone down. As it turns //out//, they&#39;re actually quite friendly. I&#39;ve named one of them Dave. He&#39;s really very nice.&#34;

&#34;Are you referring to the //plastic// flamingos that were in your yard Mr. Windsworth?&#34;

&#34;Oh. Right. Well I suppose they weren&#39;t quite as //plastic// as I had thought. Maybe they&#39;re only //partly// plastic.&#34;

&#34;Well Mr. Windsworth, I&#39;ve already filed the report, but I&#39;ll let them know. Good day Mr. Windsworth.&#34;

&#34;Oh thank you. Oh, and umm.... Good day to you as well. I suppose. Yes. A good day indeed.&#34; 

------

&#34;911. What&#39;s your &#39;mergency?&#34;

&#34;The birds! The birds are attacking me!&#34;

&#34;What birds?&#34;

&#34;The birds in my yard!&#34;

&#34;Mr. Windsworth, flamingos don&#39;t attack people.&#34;

&#34;But they did! Someone //put// them there, don&#39;t you see? First they were plastic, now they&#39;re attacking me!&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to tell you Mr. Windsworth, flamingos don&#39;t attack people. Especially not //plastic// flamingos.&#34;

&#34;But... but I saw them. They really did! One of them nearly pecked my poor eye out... All I did was try to give them some nice shrimp. I didn&#39;t //mean// to knock the poor thing over. I&#39;m telling the truth you know. You have to believe me. I really am!&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m sorry Mr. Windsworth, there&#39;s nothing I can do.&#34;

&#34;This is preposterous! //I// am an American citizen. I shall not accept this kind of treatment... I&#39;d like to speak to your Manager!&#34;

&#34;I&#39;ll put you through to my boss, Mr. Windsworth, but he&#39;ll just tell you the same thing.&#34;

------

&#34;Hello?&#34;

&#34;Who is this? Are you the manager?&#34;

&#34;Yes Mr. Windsworth. I&#39;m told you&#39;ve been having some trouble with your lawn ornaments.&#34;

&#34;Trouble! You don&#39;t know trouble. And they&#39;re certainly not //mine//. I don&#39;t know who put them there. Whoever did it, they&#39;re a //terrorist//. Those little monsters have been assaulting me. They&#39;re a public nuisance, I tell you!&#34;

&#34;Mr. Windsworth, you have to understand. No one is coming. No one will ever come. Give up.&#34;

&#34;Hello? Are you still there? Hello? ...Hello?&#34;

------

&#34;Is this Captain Jefferies?&#34;

&#34;Yeah Emerson, what&#39;s the problem? I&#39;ve been trying to get a hold of you all day.&#34;

&#34;Sorry, Cap, the damn thing died again. You should see this place though, fuckin&#39; preposterous. There&#39;s these weird-ass flamingos all over the place. Whole house is filled with &#39;em. Old man must&#39;ve been collecting the damn things.&#34;

&#34;Have you questioned him yet? The dispatcher told me he sounded a bit out of it.&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s the thing captain. The old man, Windsor or somethin&#39;, he&#39;s dead. Gaines found him out front, covered in these weird scratches. Must&#39;ve been some crazy-ass gardening accident or something. I dunno. Anyway, the guy&#39;s dead. Looks like he bled out. I think the crows already got to him, the eyes and tongue are gone.&#34;

&#34;No signs of forced entry at the house?&#34;

&#34;No. There&#39;s a broken window upstairs, but nothing bigger than, like, a bird or something could get in through there.&#34;

&#34;Alright, Emerson, call the morgue and get back to work.&#34;

&#34;Hey Cap, one more thing. The phone line&#39;s down here. Looks like something snapped it. Not sure what could have done it, though, no trees nearby. Maybe somethin&#39; landed on it or something. Whatever, I&#39;m out of here. These birds are starting to get pretty fuckin&#39; creepy.&#34;
