**Item #:** SCP-2870

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All hospital records in suspected outbreak areas are to be monitored for instances of SCP-2870-1. In the event that an instance is found, [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2431 MTF Chi-7 (&#34;Plague Tamers&#34;)] is to insert themselves into the hospital and advise SCP-2870-1 on techniques for negotiating with SCP-2870-A. Following convalescence, all records of the patient and samples of SCP-2870 collected are to be incinerated, and Class-A amnestics distributed as necessary.

All unhospitalized instances of SCP-2870-1 are to be brought to the nearest Foundation quarantine facility until convalescence, at which time they will be administered amnestics and released.

**Description:** SCP-2870 is a strain of the common cold which causes sentience and limited mobility in the mucus of the nose and throat. Despite being a single contiguous mass, sections of mucus are believed to possess separate personalities. All mucus affected by SCP-2870 is apparently under the command of SCP-2870-A, a small amount of mucus believed to reside near the opening of the nostril. While it is still possible to remove mucus from the nostril, SCP-2870-A cannot be neutralized until the patient (referred to as SCP-2870-1 for the duration of infection) is no longer infected by SCP-2870.

Telepathic communication between SCP-2870-1 and SCP-2870-A is possible, with SCP-2870-1 claiming to &#34;hear&#34; SCP-2870-A&#39;s voice at all times. SCP-2870-1 is able to return communication by prefacing their words with &#34;tell him&#34; and directly intending SCP-2870-A as the recipient. Through this method, the Foundation has learned that all instances of SCP-2870-A are noncontiguous manifestations of the same personality, claiming to be the &#34;leader&#34; (rank unspecified) of the &#34;army&#34; of mucus affected by SCP-2870. 

SCP-2870-A&#39;s stated goal is revolution, defined as taking complete control of SCP-2870-1&#39;s body, seen by SCP-2870-A as the country over which SCP-2870-1 presides. Since containment, no instance of SCP-2870-A has ever achieved this before recovery of SCP-2870-1, and it is currently unknown if such an act is possible.

It is possible for SCP-2870-1 to negotiate a relative peace with SCP-2870-A, but it is often short lived, as SCP-2870-A construes breathing through the nose, sniffing, swallowing, nasal excavation, and ingestion of any kind as an act of hostility, accusing SCP-2870-1 of sending their own troops against it.

All &#34;military&#34; actions which SCP-2870-A is capable of instigating are listed as follows:
* &#34;Drilling&#34; - mucus shifts concentration from the back of the nostril to the front of the nostril and back again several times.
* &#34;Charging&#34; - the flow of mucus into the throat increases.
* &#34;Occupation&#34; - concentration of mucus shifts into either nostril.
* &#34;Kamikaze Charge&#34; - sudden expulsion of large quantities of mucus from the nostril.

**Addendum: Interview Log 2870-Alpha**
Agent P█████ Becker was voluntarily infected with SCP-2870 for the purpose of interviewing SCP-2870-A. This took place after several hours of negotiation. SCP-2870-A was found to have no memory of the interaction in subsequent manifestations.


&gt; **SCP-2870-1:** Tell him why do you feel the need to attack me?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2870-A:** Hah! You&#39;ve been hurting us a lot longer than we&#39;ve been hurting you, your majesty!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2870-1:** Tell him I don&#39;t understand what you mean.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2870-A:** I don&#39;t blame you. The affairs of us little people must not always seem that important up on your high horse, but I&#39;ve been living with the results of your reign since I was a little phlegm.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2870-1:** Tell him I still don&#39;t understand.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2870-A:** Your troops are constantly passing through here. They push people around and dry them out. If we strayed too far into the caves, we&#39;d be knocked into the hole. I remember a few days ago when your bruisers came down here and took my mother. It was around then that we decided enough was enough.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Note that SCP-2870-1 does recall recreationally excavating his nostrils several days before infection.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2870-1:** Tell him I&#39;m sorry, but I need to do most of those things to survive.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2870-A:** Really, now? Well, sir, that&#39;s just what we&#39;re doing. I&#39;m sorry, but this fight has been long coming. I don&#39;t hold any hard feelings against you, if you were just doing what you had to do, but it&#39;s just too much for anyone to take.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2870-1:** Tell him you aren&#39;t going to win. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2870-A:** Do I care? Do any of us care? Some of us die, sure, but it&#39;s better than the long, slow death that every single one of us was doomed to back in our old lives. Besides, I&#39;d say that we&#39;re having an effect. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2870-1:** Tell him well, you are right about that.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2870-A:** There you go, then. I look forward to meeting you on the battlefield, sir.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2870-1:** Tell him I&#39;m afraid that won&#39;t be possible.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2870-A:** You said that about us winning, too.
