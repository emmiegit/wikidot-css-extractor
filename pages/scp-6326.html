**Item #:** SCP-6326

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6326 is currently located in Zone-6326, a cordoned off area of woodland near the town of Aider, Washington. Zone-6326 is known to the public as a wildlife reserve for an endangered species of mushroom and is to be monitored by surveillance equipment and daily patrol of the perimeter. SCP-6326&#39;s habitat is to be monitored for the presence of other animals, particularly fish, deer, elk, and moose, with populations of the aforementioned animals kept at normal levels as to be natural food sources for SCP-6326.

Attempts by civilians of Aider to access the area are to be handled by local law enforcement. Online disinformation methods include obviously fraudulent reports of sightings, poorly edited photos claiming to depict SCP-6326, and pages debunking the existence of the anomaly. Residents of Aider are permitted to believe in the fictionalized version of SCP-6326 as a &#34;cryptid.&#34;

Agent Ira Watts is currently undercover in Aider in order to gather information from residents about SCP-6326.

**Description:** SCP-6326 is a hexapedal mammal that resembles a combination of a human man and a grizzly bear. Colloquially known by locals as the &#34;Manbear,&#34; SCP-6326 is often described as having a centaur-like build, with the upper torso, front legs and head of a bear attached to the shoulders of a white male human body. SCP-6326 moves primarily by crawling on its humanoid hands and feet, but has been observed running bipedally on occasion. It displays similar behavior to non-anomalous bears, subsisting on a diet of fish, scavenged or hunted game animals, and vegetation, and hibernates during winter months. Its humanoid body differs from a non-anomalous human in the following respects:
* thicker epidermis with higher resistance to extreme temperatures
* coarser body hair
* slightly larger body proportions
* denser bones
* thicker and harder fingernails
* denser muscle mass
* various differences in sizes of internal organs

Despite its possession of a partially humanoid body, SCP-6326 displays a level of intelligence no higher than non-anomalous bears. While it uses its humanoid hands for hunting and other means of survival, SCP-6326 does not appear to have the capacity to make or use tools.

[[include component:image-block | name=manbear.png | caption=SCP-6326 as illustrated by fan club member]]

SCP-6326 regularly patrols a route considered to be the edge of its territory. Upon attempts to remove SCP-6326 from this area, SCP-6326 will vanish and reappear at a random location within the territory. It is noted that removal from the area is upsetting to SCP-6326, and upon reappearance it will become extremely aggressive. While aggravated, SCP-6326 has been observed punching and kicking objects with its humanoid limbs. 

**History:** SCP-6326 came to the attention of the Foundation after a photo of the anomaly began circulating throughout online cryptozoology forums. All occurrences of the photo were deleted, as were other pieces of credible evidence. The town of Aider, nearby SCP-6326&#39;s territory, has developed a deeply integrated local culture surrounding the anomaly, with themed businesses, clubs, public artwork and a small (but not insignificant) tourism industry. Considering the success of Foundation disinformation, very few residents or visitors of the town sincerely believe SCP-6326 exists, treating it instead as a local legend.

&gt; 
&gt; **Watts:** This can&#39;t be my assignment. I&#39;m way overqualified for this. 
&gt;

**Addendum 1: Undercover Operation**

Agent Watts has been embedded in Aider&#39;s largest &#34;Manbear&#34; social club in order to glean information about the origins of SCP-6326. Multiple club members [[footnote]] Designated PoI-6326-1-4; Harold Berlentanshen, Hunter Smith, Shanie Meyer-White, Carol Vaughan [[/footnote]] are confirmed to have seen SCP-6326.

[[Collapsible show=&#34;The following log was taken during a bi-monthly club meeting and recorded via camcorder&#34; hide=&#34;Close&#34;]]

&gt; **[Begin Log]**
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-6326-2:** If everybody wants to have a seat, we- we- we&#39;ll get the meeting started. It- it- it&#39;s a special meeting today, because we have a new member in our ranks!
&gt; 
&gt; [Agent Watts can be heard groaning]
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-6326-2:** Why- why don&#39;t you stand up and introduce yourself?
&gt; 
&gt; **Watts:** No.
&gt; 
&gt; [Several seconds of silence]
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-6326-2:** Okay! If-
&gt; 
&gt; **Watts:** Wait, wait, fine. Hi. I&#39;m, uh, I&#39;m Keaton Ramsey, and I&#39;m...
&gt; 
&gt; [Agent Watts speaks through clenched teeth]
&gt; 
&gt; **Watts:** I&#39;m here doing preliminary research for my... amateur art house documentary... that I am making... because I am a... film student.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-6326-2:** Sounds very interesting! Everybody give- give him a round of applause!
&gt; 
&gt; [Club members clap sporadically]
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-6326-2:** Now, we- we- we have some news to go over, 
&gt; 
&gt; [Majority of meeting consists of discussion of various false theories and fabricated sightings, extraneous information has been expunged for brevity]
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-6326-2:** Don&#39;t forget to- to- to talk to Keaton about your interview!
&gt; 
&gt; **Watts:** I actually only need interviews from a couple of you-
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-6326-2:** Everybody gets to be in the movie!
&gt; 
&gt; **Watts:** Okay.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-6326-2:** Our next meeting will- will be on the 16th, and it&#39;s going to be- be a big one! Howard [[footnote]] PoI-6326-1 [[/footnote]] is going to be there, and he says he has some spicy new evidence!

&gt; 
&gt; **Watts:** Yeah. Is that guy in the picture Howard?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-6326-2:** It- it sure is. Taken at our annual barbecue last year.
&gt; 
&gt; **Watts:** And that&#39;s a wizard hat that he&#39;s wearing?

Dr. Gaiser,

I am requesting an assignment transfer. I do not believe that I am an appropriate fit for this assignment. My skillset does not align with the responsibilities required of me here, and I strongly feel that this anomaly would be better served by someone with more experience with civilians. Thank you for your consideration.

Ira,

Your request is denied. Due to the nature of your injury and how you acquired it, you are not cleared for advanced threat missions for at least several years. I understand your frustration, but this is the closest thing to field work I could get for you. Unless you want a desk job, you&#39;re stuck with the Manbear.

&gt; **Name: Carol Vaughan**
&gt; **Age:** 42
&gt; **Notes:** Saw SCP-6326 while in the area painting a watercolor landscape. Sketched SCP-6326 in a small notebook. Sighting verified as true.

&gt; **[Begin Log]**
&gt; 
&gt; **Watts:** So you drew the Manbear?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-6326-4:** Yes! I&#39;ve drawn lots of pictures of the Manbear, it sticks in your mind. But the first time, I was out painting, and it wandered into my field of view. It&#39;s really a majestic thing. Have you seen it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Watts:** Nope. Do you have a copy of that drawing?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-6326-4:** I have a picture of it on my phone. But the original is in a frame down at Cherry&#39;s![[footnote]] Local gift shop [[/footnote]] They bought it off me for $50.
&gt; 
&gt; **Watts:** Can I see the picture?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-6326-4:** Of course! Let me find it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Watts:** And you&#39;re //positive// that you saw the real thing? How do you know it wasn&#39;t just a regular bear?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-6326-4:** Oh, it had human anatomy. Of a man. I made sure to capture that in the drawing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Watts:** OH my god, yes you did. 
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-6326-4:** Yeah, it makes some folks uncomfy, but accuracy is very important to me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Watts:** You know what? I know a lot of people who also really love accuracy, let me get a closer shot of that.

&gt; **Notes:** PoI-6326-1 spent several years taking regular camping trips in the area surrounding SCP-6326&#39;s territory in attempt to gather more evidence of its existence. All gathered print casts, drawings and fur samples have been successfully branded as hoaxes by Foundation disinformation efforts. Several samples have been destroyed or vandalized as well.

&gt; 
&gt; **Watts:** Did it look anything like a raccoon?

&gt; **Member A:** It can change its shape.
&gt; 
&gt; **Watts:** ...It can change its shape.

&gt; **Member B:** And my psychic says that dreams can predict the future, so I pay attention and I write it all down. Last night, I had a dream that I was playing this video game, and the Manbear was there. He was in the video game. But also the video game was a game of my stepdad&#39;s house, and the Manbear was my stepdad. I haven&#39;t figured out what it means yet.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; **Member B:** Anyway. The most important dream I had was actually a few months back-
&gt; 
&gt; **Watts:** Ohh my god.

&gt; **Member C:** And then it ran off into the woods. It was too big to be a regular bear.

Ira,

Good news. I spoke with Commander Conley and he agreed not to have you fired. I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t need to tell you that you&#39;re on thin ice. I pleaded mental instability following your injury, but that&#39;s not going to hold up forever so you had better be a MODEL of good behavior at your next position. You cannot pull something like this again.

That being said, I have found a new assignment for you. You&#39;ll be getting the details in a couple days. And I better not hear you complaining. Beggars can&#39;t be choosers. 

I&#39;m sure you want to know what we found out about that helicopter photo you found? It&#39;s pretty fascinating.
