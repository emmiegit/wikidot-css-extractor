**Item #:** SCP-078-J

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the apparent omnipresence of SCP-078-J-1, researchers have constructed several safe houses for refugees. These safe houses are to be equipped with a large memetic deterrent consisting of a sign that states &#34;NO GURLZ ALLOWD!!&#34; and various drawings of cool boy stuff like dragons. No pink is to be allowed into these safe houses.

**Description:** SCP-078-J is a highly contagious biohazard spread through physical contact with SCP-078-J-1 (Especially on the lips!!). Although the properties of SCP-078-J are not fully understood, it is well known for causing various cases of yuckiness, bad smells, and immediate death.

SCP-078-J-1 is a malevolent creature that typically inhabits an area colloquially known as the &#34;playground&#34;. There are several different versions of SCP-078-J-1 that will wander this area at any given time. Current research performed by Junior Researcher James[[footnote]] [[[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-789-j|Junior Researcher James]]] has been commended for his quick thinking during incident 536-J-3, during which a group of SCP-078-J-1 surrounded him in an attempt to perform a &#34;makeover&#34;. Researcher James cleverly reached a finger into his nose and pulled out a large booger, with which he fended off SCP-078-J-1. [[/footnote]] has pointed towards SCP-078-J-1 possibly being extraterrestrial in origin. That would certainly explain why they don&#39;t like Power Rangers.

Prolonged exposure to SCP-078-J carriers results in an expansion of the larynx, a development of the sexual organs, an increase in bodily growth, and the sprouting of various hairs around the body, as well as a marked fondness towards SCP-078-J-1. Researchers agree this is totally gross.</textarea></pre>
