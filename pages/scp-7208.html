**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7208 is [[size 0.8em]],,INTRINSIC,,^^AXIOMATIC^^[[/size]] to a majority of [[size 0.8em]],,PATTERNS,,^^CONSTRUCTS^^[[/size]] that make up baseline reality. As a result, the disruption of SCP-7208 or any of its constituents is to be avoided.

Due to the [[size 0.8em]],,NATURE,,^^PERSONALITY^^[[/size]] of SCP-7208, it may only be described using inherently nebulous language, such as ##430704|semiotic pataphors,##[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Descriptions that employ concepts of adjacent or fundamentally disparate connotation in order to construct novel concepts with broader implications, or to approximate concepts that [[size 0.8em]],,RESIDE,,^^FESTER^^[[/size]] outside the Nöosphere. [[/span]] terms with many or contradictory definitions, and ##430704|motifs## which serve to make [[size 0.8em]],,BRIEFING,,^^SYMBOLISM^^[[/size]] more ambiguous, but are otherwise ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,IRRELEVANT,,^^NEGLIGIBLE^^[[/size]]## to SCP-7208 as a whole.

In general, SCP-7208 may not be [[size 0.8em]],,CONVEYED,,^^WOVEN^^[[/size]] using concepts that suppose any [[size 0.8em]],,BELITTLING,,^^SUPPRESSIVE^^[[/size]] connotation, nor may it be [[size 0.8em]],,REFERRED,,^^ALLUDED^^[[/size]] to using any designation other than “SCP-7208,” which inherently expresses no meaningful connotation as to the significance of SCP-7208.

Information about SCP-7208 is limited to personnel with Level 4 Clearance or higher; ##430704|further research has been suspended indefinitely.##

Personnel are advised to avoid [[size 0.8em]],,DIVINING,,^^CONCEIVING^^[[/size]] SCP-7208 any unique or specific definition. All personnel directly involved in the [[size 0.8em]],,OBSERVATION,,^^SUPERVISION^^[[/size]] of SCP-7208 are to be screened biweekly for indications that they have attempted, consciously or unconsciously, to [[size 0.8em]],,UNRAVEL,,^^FATHOM^^[[/size]] SCP-7208 or any of its elements.

Personnel who understand SCP-7208 are to be terminated immediately.

**Description:** SCP-7208 is the [[size 0.8em]],,RHAPSODY,,^^TAPESTRY^^[[/size]] of concepts that preside over ##430704|luck##. SCP-7208 has only been partially analysed, due to its aforementioned [[size 0.8em]],,NATURE,,^^PERSONALITY^^[[/size]]. The portions known to the Foundation correspond to the concepts of probability, randomness, circumstance, and ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,SERENDIPITY,,^^SYZYGY^^[[/size]]##.

##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,ABIGAIL,,^^AMELIA^^[[/size]] Weaver##, director of the analysis of SCP-7208 until its indefinite suspension, is currently held in a standard humanoid containment cell until further notice.

From the limited portions of SCP-7208’s [[size 0.8em]],,TOPOLOGY,,^^CATEGORY^^[[/size]], it was hypothesised that SCP-7208 [[size 0.8em]],,PERMEATES,,^^DOMINATES^^[[/size]] up to █8.14% of the Nöosphere in such a way that it at least partially intersects with human concepts of faith, hope, intention, and ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,CREATIVITY,,^^FREEDOM^^[[/size]]##.

As a result, SCP-7208 and its constituents are directly impacted by a subject’s ##430704|interpretation## of their meaning. This is somewhat [[size 0.8em]],,ALLEVIATED,,^^REMEDIED^^[[/size]] by SCP-7208&#39;s special containment procedures, namely the use of ##430704|pataphors,## which effectively prevent subjects from constructing a coherent mental picture of the [[size 0.8em]],,RHAPSODY,,^^TAPESTRY^^[[/size]] onto which they may, consciously or unconsciously, suppose their own ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,VERSE,,^^STITCHING^^[[/size]]##. 

Changes in SCP-7208 or its constituents are directly reflected in baseline reality. One such ##430704|reality restructuring event##[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]τὰ ἐπὶ τὰ μεταφυσικά[[/span]] has occurred. (see: Incident-7208-π)

##430704|Director [[size 0.8em]],,ABIGAIL,,^^AMELIA^^[[/size]] Weaver## is not to be identified using any specific or unique designation other than the duonym which was retroactively [[size 0.8em]],,APPENDED,,^^SEWN^^[[/size]] to her [[size 0.8em]],,IDENTITY,,^^VOLITION^^[[/size]] following the events of Incident-7208-π .

##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,ABIGAIL,,^^AMELIA^^[[/size]] Weaver## directed a temporary research team assigned to analyse the portions of the Nöosphere corresponding to human ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,CREATIVITY,,^^FREEDOM^^[[/size]]##. Her discovery and subsequent partial [[size 0.8em]],,TOPOLOGICAL,,^^CATEGORICAL^^[[/size]] analysis of SCP-7208 has allowed the Foundation to develop an iterative framework for ##430704|determining## the outcomes of random or otherwise anomalous events to an arbitrary degree of accuracy,[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]##430704|Monkeys and typewriters.##[[/span]] designated Protocol-7208-ρ &#34;Rhapsody.&#34;

&gt; 
&gt; [knocking is heard from the door]
&gt; 
&gt; ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,ABIGAIL,,^^AMELIA^^[[/size]] Weaver##: &#34;Come in?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [a ##430704|civilian## identified as Andrew Taylor enters the room]
&gt; 
&gt; ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,ABIGAIL,,^^AMELIA^^[[/size]] Weaver##: &#34;I hope what you’re about to tell me is important.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Andrew: &#34;I am sick and tired of this entire project.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,ABIGAIL,,^^AMELIA^^[[/size]] Weaver##: &#34;You came to me just to complain?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Andrew approaches ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,ABIGAIL,,^^AMELIA^^[[/size]] Weaver&#39;s## [[size 0.8em]],,DESK,,^^LOOM^^[[/size]]]
&gt; 
&gt; Andrew: “Do you think you can blame me when all our research has been nothing but prancing around a single data structure, pretending that if we think about it as little as humanly possible, we might be able to draw it out of its shell enough to catch it in a jar, all so the Foundation can shake it up every time reality isn’t tickling its fancy?”
&gt; 
&gt; ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,ABIGAIL,,^^AMELIA^^[[/size]] Weaver##: &#34;Andrew, you know very well our protocols and our rules regarding SCP-7208, I suggest you–&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Andrew slams both of his hands against the [[size 0.8em]],,DESK,,^^LOOM^^[[/size]]] 
&gt; 
&gt; Andrew: //&#34;I know very well// our pedantic platitude horseshit.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,ABIGAIL,,^^AMELIA^^[[/size]] Weaver##: //&#34;Andrew.&#34;//
&gt; 
&gt; Andrew: &#34;Are we playing hard-to-get with a //memeplex?// Why can’t we just nail this thing on the head and get our framework over with?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,ABIGAIL,,^^AMELIA^^[[/size]] Weaver##: &#34;We //can&#39;t.&#34;//
&gt; 
&gt; Andrew: &#34;Why? Why can’t we? What’s the matter?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,ABIGAIL,,^^AMELIA^^[[/size]] Weaver##: &#34;Were you present during any of our briefings?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Andrew: “Oh please, pretend I wasn’t.”
&gt; 
&gt; [a pause; ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,ABIGAIL,,^^AMELIA^^[[/size]] Weaver## is seen burying her face in her hands, groaning]
&gt; 
&gt; ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,ABIGAIL,,^^AMELIA^^[[/size]] Weaver##: &#34;We were all assigned by Foundation executives to look inside the Nöosphere at the idea, or the concept, or //whatever// of human ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,CREATIVITY,,^^FREEDOM^^[[/size]]##. What we found clung, or attached, or //sucking up to it// was a piece of a much //bigger// idea. When we mapped out more and more of it, we found it was just dissolved, just //woven// into reality as a whole, and because it was intersecting with ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,CREATIVITY,,^^FREEDOM^^[[/size]]## //of all things,// we couldn’t make any assumptions about it whatsoever, or else those assumptions would have become the //de facto truth.&#34;//
&gt; 
&gt; [Andrew is seen stepping back from the [[size 0.8em]],,DESK,,^^LOOM^^[[/size]]]
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Andrew: &#34;So we understand it more so we can understand it less?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,ABIGAIL,,^^AMELIA^^[[/size]] Weaver##: &#34;It would be best if we don’t understand it //at all,// but it appears to be necessary if we want to get any use out of it.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Andrew: &#34;What use does it have if we can’t meaningfully interact with it in a way that doesn’t jeopardise our existence?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,ABIGAIL,,^^AMELIA^^[[/size]] Weaver##: &#34;That’s still to be determined. I //strongly// urge you to get back to your research and help everyone figure that out.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Andrew: &#34;You have to be fucking–&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Andrew approaches the door]
&gt; 
&gt; ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,ABIGAIL,,^^AMELIA^^[[/size]] Weaver##: &#34;Where are you going?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Andrew: &#34;This is not worth the amount of time you put into it; ##430704|it’s consuming you##. I’m not going to be part of a stupid fucking passion project.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Andrew exits the room]
 
In the hour following the time of recording, all research of SCP-7208 was terminated. During the reassignment of personnel, it was found that no researcher named Andrew Taylor had ever [[size 0.8em]],,CONTRIBUTED,,^^SUBMITTED^^[[/size]] to the research of SCP-7208.

##430704|Director [[size 0.8em]],,ABIGAIL,,^^AMELIA^^[[/size]] Weaver## was discovered [[size 0.8em]],,PEACEFUL,,^^COMATOSE^^[[/size]] in her office, and immediately admitted to the Foundation’s on-site infirmary.

##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,ABIGAIL,,^^AMELIA^^[[/size]] Weaver## is an integral constituent of SCP-7208 ’s overall structure. Her continued well-being is [[size 0.8em]],,INTRINSIC,,^^AXIOMATIC^^[[/size]] to the integrity of SCP-7208, and Foundation efforts are currently aimed toward methods of prolonging her [[size 0.8em]],,LIFE,,^^DREAM^^[[/size]] in containment. 

[[div_ class=&#34;no-addendum&#34;]]
[[collapsible show=&#34;Access Addendum-7208-ρ (Level 5 Clearance Required)&#34; hide=&#34;Hide Addendum-7208-ρ&#34;]]

 **Protocol-7208-ρ “Rhapsode”:** Using findings detailed in ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,ABIGAIL,,^^AMELIA^^[[/size]] Weaver’s## initial reports regarding SCP-7208, the Foundation has developed an iterative ludometric framework which can ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,DETERMINE,,^^DETERMINE^^[[/size]]## the outcomes of otherwise unpredictable circumstances.

This is [[size 0.8em]],,ACHIEVED,,^^IMAGINED^^[[/size]] by generalising a circumstance into a family[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]][[size 0.85em]]∀A∀B[∃X:X∈A⇔X∈B]⇒A=B[[/size]][[/span]] of [[size 0.8em]],,ANALOGOUS,,^^SYNONYMOUS^^[[/size]] designations, which are subsequently fed into SCP-7208. In response, SCP-7208 will produce an array of possible events.

The ##430704|ludokinetic potential## of each event is assigned a range of values according to a ##430704|blatancy scale## centred at 0.0 Jarries,[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]One --Jerry-- Jarry is defined to be a dimensionless unit of ##430704|ludokinetic potential,## equivalent to exactly how obvious it is that the sky is blue and not red.[[/span]] where negative values are deemed impossible or illogical.

Personnel are reminded that measuring events to a single value will inherently alter them as a result of their perceived certainty.

&gt; **Experiment-7208-ρ001:**
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; **Intention:** To accurately predict the numeral that a twenty-sided die lands on prior to rolling.
&gt; 
&gt; **Summary:** The act of rolling a d20 die was generalised into a collection of designations, all of which were fed into SCP-7208. The outcomes produced by SCP-7208 converged upon &#34;7.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; The die was rolled, and it landed on &#34;7.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; This experiment was repeated fourteen more times, each time converging upon the correct outcome.
&gt; 
&gt; **Measured Potential:** 0.9–1.3 Jarries
&gt; 
&gt; **Comments:** Non-integer values and values outside the range a d20 die is capable of landing on were both produced, all of which were measured to have negative ludokinetic potential. The experiment has been judged to be successful.

&gt; **Experiment-7208-ρ002:**
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; **Intention:** To accurately predict the arrangement of a deck of 52 playing cards prior to shuffling.
&gt; 
&gt; **Summary:** The concept of a shuffled deck of cards and the act of shuffling were both generalised and fed into SCP-7208. The resultant outcomes converged upon one arrangement, which matched the arrangement that was later produced.
&gt; 
&gt; The experiment was repeated using various other shuffling methods, such as overhand shuffling, cutting and rifling the deck, and the casino wash.
&gt; 
&gt; **Measured Potential:** 1.7 – 2.2 Jarries
&gt; 
&gt; **Comments:** Arrangements which contained too few or too many cards, as well as arrangements that contained duplicate cards, were produced, all of which measured to have negative ludokinetic potential
&gt; 
&gt; The experiment has been judged to be successful.

&gt; **Experiment-7208-ρ003:**
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; **Intention:** To accurately predict the date and time of future seismic activity in Anchorage, Alaska.
&gt; 
&gt; **Summary:** The concept of an earthquake was generalised and fed into SCP-7208. The outcomes produced by SCP-7208 converged upon 23-08-20██ at 3:34 PM. The city of Anchorage was evacuated one day prior to the projected event.
&gt; 
&gt; A magnitude 6.8 earthquake occurred at the exact date and time ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,DETERMINED,,^^DETERMINED^^[[/size]]## by SCP-7208.
&gt; 
&gt; **Measured Potential:** 2.5 Jarries
&gt; 
&gt; **Comments:** The Foundation is currently investigating the application of Protocol-7208-ρ in proactive responses to on-site containment breaches.

&gt; **Experiment-7208-ρ004:** 
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; **Intention:** To accurately predict whether a pattern created in John Conway’s “Game of Life&#34;[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]It is impossible to mathematically determine whether a pattern will halt; the problem is understood to be ##430704|undecidable##.[[/span]] will halt.
&gt; 
&gt; **Summary:** Randomly generated patterns were fed directly into SCP-7208, which correctly ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,DETERMINED,,^^DETERMINED^^[[/size]]## their respective stabilities.
&gt; 
&gt; Patterns which are already understood to halt or not were excluded.
&gt; 
&gt; **Measured Potential:** 4.0 Jarries
&gt; 
&gt; **Comments:** The Foundation is considering the application of Protocol-7208-ρ for other likewise undecidable problems in mathematics.

&gt; **Experiment-7208-ρ005:**
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; **Intention:** To ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,DETERMINE,,^^DETERMINE^^[[/size]]## the outcome of a lottery ticket prior to playing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Summary:** The concept of purchasing and playing a lottery ticket was generalised and fed to SCP-7208.
&gt; 
&gt; The first lottery ticket played was ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,DETERMINED,,^^DETERMINED^^[[/size]]## to win a jackpot of 25 million USD.
&gt; 
&gt; **Measured Potential:** 38.5 Jarries
&gt; 
&gt; **Comments:** //Access to Protocol-7208-ρ has been restricted to personnel with Clearance Level 5 or higher.//

&gt; **Experiment-7208-ρ006:**
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; **Intention:** To ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,DETERMINE,,^^DETERMINE^^[[/size]]## exactly when SCP-106 will next breach containment.
&gt; 
&gt; **Summary:** SCP-106 breached containment, causing ██ casualties and widespread damage to on-site infrastructure.
&gt; 
&gt; **Measured Potential:** 52,087.0 Jarries
&gt; 
&gt; **Comments:** //All ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,SERENDIPITY,,^^SYZYGY^^[[/size]]## using Protocol-7208-ρ has been terminated.//

**Addendum 7208-ρ:** Upon reviewing all available documentation pertaining to SCP-7208 and Protocol-7208-ρ, it has been ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,DETERMINED,,^^DETERMINED^^[[/size]]## that SCP-7208 an ##430704|intranarrative##[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]A narrative that is primarily influenced by its own characters.[[/span]] meme complex whose central theme is &#34;perception is reality, and reality is perception,&#34; reflected in its conflation and subsequent reinforcement as a Nöospheric entity by Foundation personnel.

Any and all interaction with SCP-7208 has been ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,DETERMINED,,^^DETERMINED^^[[/size]]## to cause retroactive alterations to baseline narrative, corresponding to assumptions related to SCP-7208 itself, its constituents, individuals directly involved in researching SCP-7208, and ##430704|[[size 0.8em]],,SERENDIPITY,,^^SYZYGY^^[[/size]]##.

All personnel directly involved in the [[size 0.8em]],,OBSERVATION,,^^SUPERVISION^^[[/size]] of SCP-7208 are to be amnesticised as soon as possible in order to mitigate the risk of an ∀K-Class &#34;Immersion Break&#34; Narrative Collapse Scenario.

The Foundation has concluded that ##430704|luck## is inherently pataphysical.
