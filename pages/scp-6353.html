**Item #:** SCP-6353

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment of all SCP-6353 is not viable. However, individuals may be captured by impediment of the forelegs or killed with conventional weapons.

**Description:** SCP-6353 appear identical to the Eurasian Badger [[footnote]]Meles Meles[[/footnote]] and exhibit intelligence comparable to humans. 

SCP-6353 are able to &#34;burrow&#34; through the fabric of spacetime, travelling interstellar distances within a matter of seconds. This is carried out by a physical digging motion which creates a portal to an extradimensional space which is used as a tunnel.

SCP-6353 can “smell” across interstellar distances, pinpointing the source with great accuracy and without lightspeed delay.

Multiple cubs were cloned from DNA samples obtained from SCP-6353-1, however none have exhibited any anomalous abilities as of yet.

**Discovery:** SCP-6353-1 was found near the village of Bonnybridge in the UK. Foundation personnel were dispatched after unusual reports to local authorities. A burrow had been discovered with five people chained inside, the captives claimed to have been kidnapped by a talking badger. Agent McCallion was assigned to investigate and carried out interviews with the captives.

**Witness interview: Professor John Tanaka**
**Date:** 12/07/2010
**Interviewed:** Professor John Tanaka
**Interviewer:** Agent McCallion
----
**&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;**

**Agent McCallion:** Hello sir, I understand you&#39;ve been through an awful lot so I&#39;ll try to keep this brief. First off, we&#39;ve contacted your family, they know you’re safe and we’ve arranged for you to fly back to the US in the morning.

**Professor John Tanaka:** Can I call them? Can I speak to my wife?

**Agent McCallion:** Of course Professor, we just need to get this down first, then I&#39;ll get you a phone. Alright?

**Professor John Tanaka:** I&#39;m not going to say anything... indiscreet. I just want to talk to her, just hear her voice. I understand the need for secrecy, I do. You don&#39;t need to worry about me, I swear. I just want to talk to my family.

**Agent McCallion:** I understand sir, and I do appreciate your discretion. I promise, I&#39;ll let you use my own phone just as soon as we&#39;re done here. OK?

**Professor John Tanaka:** //*sigh*// OK.

**Agent McCallion:** OK. So I want to make sure I&#39;ve got this right, you work at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii?

**Professor John Tanaka:** Yes.

**Agent McCallion:** And that&#39;s the last place you remember being before...

**Professor John Tanaka:** Yes, I was just leaving when, It came for me.

**Agent McCallion:** I understand this is difficult, but can you describe how it happened?

**Professor John Tanaka:** I heard the voice: low and harsh. It called my name. I couldn&#39;t see anybody, so I answered back. Stupidest thing I&#39;ve ever done. Suddenly I was falling. I was standing on solid ground but it just gave way. I landed hard in the dirt, somewhere cold and dark. It locked that cuff on my leg. The others were there: Fritz, Madelaine, Ishiro, Frank. It said I was to help them, that we would go free once the work was done.

**Agent McCallion:** And what was the work?

**Professor John Tanaka:** It wanted us to find a planet. Its home. We didn&#39;t have much to go on. And we could only work at night, when It was there to watch us. When It left in the morning It disconnected the internet. At least that gave us time to sleep, to talk.

**Agent McCallion:** How far along were you?

**Professor John Tanaka:** We were basically just guessing, pulling up stars and seeing if they might match the star maps It had drawn up, which weren&#39;t great. Could be the very next one we tried would&#39;ve been it, or we could have been down there forever.

**Agent McCallion:** Did It tell you why It came here?

**Professor John Tanaka:** Claimed to be lost. A lone traveller lost among the stars, just trying to get home. But never believed that. Sometimes...

**Agent McCallion:** Sometimes...?

**Professor John Tanaka:** Sometimes I got the feeling there was something else going on. It would say &#34;we&#34; instead of &#34;I&#34;. Like, &#34;We should never have come here&#34;, I distinctly remember that.

**Agent McCallion:** Could It have been referring to you and the other astronomers?

**Professor John Tanaka:** No. There are more of them. They could be anywhere, everywhere.

**&lt;END LOG&gt;:**

**Closing Statement:** All five astronomers were kept in isolation for 30 days in order to ensure all pertinent details were obtained and they had not been contaminated. They were then given amnestics and released using a cover story blaming religious extremists.

A trap was arranged in the burrow. At dusk SCP-6353-1 was shot with tranquiliser darts and transported to site 91 for examination and questioning.

**Interview with SCP-6353-1**
**Date:** 18/07/2010
**Interviewed:** SCP-6353-1
**Interviewer:** Agent McCallion
----

**&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;:**

**Agent McCallion:**  Hello, my name is Agent McCallion. I need to ask you some questions.

**SCP-6353-1:** //*growl*// 

**Agent McCallion:**  This will go a lot easier if you co-operate with us. We know you can talk, according to the astronomers you are fluent in at least English, Japanese and German. 

**SCP-6353-1:** //*whine*//

**Agent McCallion:** Y’know, this act isn’t in your best interest. If we were to determine you were just a normal badger, we wouldn’t release you. You’d be put down.

**SCP-6353-1:** //*snort*// You can’t do that. It would contravene The Protection Of Badger Act 1992. I am afforded legal protection. You are already guilty of several offences under the law: 
Taking me here against my will violates Section One subsection One: &#34;A person is guilty of an offence if he wilfully kills, injures or takes a badger.&#34;

Holding me in these restrains violates Section Two, subsection 1A: &#34;A person is guilty of an offence if he cruelly ill-treats a badger&#34;

And finally, //*snort*// your interference in my sett violates Section Three, subsection 1E: &#34;disturbing a badger when it is occupying a badgersett&#34;

**Agent McCallion:**  That’s better.

**SCP-6353-1:** Not for you. //*snort*// You are in breach of the law, Agent McCallion, therefore I suggest you release me immediately.

**Agent McCallion:**  I noticed that you decided to leave out the many exceptions in Sections Six through Ten. But that’s academic, the people I work for are not bound by such laws. 

**SCP-6353-1:**  And who exactly, //*snort*// are you working for Agent McCallion? 

**Agent McCallion:** An organisation which specialises in threats like you. 

**SCP-6353-1:** I am not a threat. You do not need to treat me this way. 

**Agent McCallion:** You were a threat to the astronomers you kidnapped. The five of them were locked up in the dark all day, forced to work as your slaves all night, and yet you’re bold enough to complain about your treatment?

**SCP-6353-1:** I needed them, what are five compared with the billions you have on this planet? //*snort*// I kept them well fed, didn’t I? And they were to be released as soon as the work was done.

**Agent McCallion:** Ah yes, the work. Perhaps you could explain that to me?

**SCP-6353-1:** //*whine*// I am trying to find my way home. I am of the Broc, we are spread far throughout the stars, with colonies on hundreds of worlds.

**Agent McCallion:** Is that why you came here, to colonise Earth?

**SCP-6353-1:** //*squeak*// No Agent MacCallion. We have no need of this world. While we could live here, it is far from ideal, Class D. We generally only colonise Class B or higher.

**Agent McCallion:** Why are you here then?

**SCP-6353-1:** I am a historian, an archaeologist. The greatest of my generation, //*squeak*// I have come here to research the origins of our race. I was working my way back though the oldest known colonies when I smelled Broc here. It was faint, unusual, but as I came closer the scent became unmistakable.

**Agent McCallion:** You smelled your kind here? From space?

**SCP-6353-1:** Yes, except they were not Broc, not really. They were these… //*snort*//…things. Badgers. Unthinking brutes, mindless animals in the guise of Broc. Imagine, Agent McCallion, that you were trapped in a world of zombies.

**Agent McCallion:** I can appreciate your disappointment. I understand why you wanted to leave, but not why you needed help from those astronomers. Was your ship damaged?

**SCP-6353-1:** //*squeak*// We don’t need machines to move through space. We are Broc. We simply dig. A wormhole is the closest your culture has come to understanding it. We tunnel into The Other Soil.

**Agent McCallion:** Interesting. But you haven’t explained why you are still here.

**SCP-6353-1:** I was attacked //*snort*// by one of those beasts. I didn’t know then, I thought they were Broc, I tried to speak with it and the savage tried to kill me. I fought it off, but in doing so I was injured. //*whine*//

**Agent McCallion:** And those injuries meant you can’t make wormholes?

**SCP-6353-1:** No, I can dig perfectly well, the problem is my nose.

**Agent McCallion:** Your nose? How- ah. You smelled them here…

**SCP-6353-1:** You understand?

**Agent McCallion:** So, then you began gathering astronomers to make up for what you lost.

**SCP-6353-1:** Yes.

**Agent McCallion:** …Ok, I think I have the basics but there are some details we need to go over. 

**SCP-6353-1:** And then you will release me?

**Agent McCallion:** We can’t just let you loose to kidnap more scientists.

**SCP-6353-1:** It would be in your best interest //*snort*// to assist me, Agent McCallion. My people would reward you for aiding me. We have much which could benefit your people.

**Agent McCallion:** Perhaps we will, but first we need to go over the details. For example, did you come alone?

**SCP-6353-1:** Yes

**Agent McCallion:** Really? Here archaeologists usually work in teams.

**SCP-6353-1:** I do not need assistants, //*snort*// I am quite capable of working alone.

**Agent McCallion:** Well... until now.

**SCP-6353-1:** //*growl*//

**Agent McCallion:**  So you were the only Broc to come to Earth?

**SCP-6353-1:** Yes.

**Agent McCallion:** And there is no one out there who might be looking for you?

**SCP-6353-1:** Likely there are, but I travelled so far, through abandoned colonies and past forgotten planets, places known to no living Broc but myself. //*whine*// Finding me would be very difficult for them.

**Agent McCallion:** When did you arrive?

**SCP-6353-1:** Third of March, 2009.

**Agent McCallion:** That’s more than a year before the kidnappings began.

**SCP-6353-1:** At first, I struggled simply to survive, //*whine*// it was very difficult. I slowly learned the ways of this world: your habits, your languages, your technology. I feared revealing myself might lead to //*snort*// a situation like this.

**Agent McCallion:** I expect you had another sett, aside from the one you kept the astronomers in. Somewhere you slept during the day?

**SCP-6353-1:** Yes

**Agent McCallion:** We will need its location.  

**SCP-6353-1:** //*whine*// You will find little there. Bedding, some food…

**Agent McCallion:** Nonetheless, we must check.

**SCP-6353-1:** //*snort*// Agent McCallion, after my initial, and I think you would agree understandable hesitance, I have been very co-operative. I have given you a great deal of information about myself and my species. //*snort*// I have much more to offer, but you must do something to show my trust has not been misplaced. There must be give and take.

**Agent McCallion:** Yes, you have been quite co-operative, and so long as that continues, I am sure we will be able to make things more comfortable for you.

**SCP-6353-1:** I am glad to hear that, Agent McCallion. Would you be willing to bring me some water?

**Agent McCallion:** Yes, that would be easy enough. Would you like something to eat as well?

**SCP-6353-1:** Thank you, some fruit would be nice, I am quite partial to raspberries. And perhaps some nuts?

**Agent McCallion:** I will have it brought as soon as we finish here.

**SCP-6353-1:** And when do we expect that will be?

**Agent McCallion:** Very soon. I just need a couple more things to finish my report, such as the location of your sett. 

**SCP-6353-1:** //*snort*// The co-ordinates are [REDACTED].

**Agent McCallion:** Thank you. Finally, did you bring any equipment or other items with you to Earth?

**SCP-6353-1:** No, we have no need. We have excellent memories and need nothing so long as our noses and paws are working.

**Agent McCallion:** Perfect. I will see about getting your refreshments.

**SCP-6353-1:** Can I now be released from these restraints?

**Agent McCallion:** I’m not sure we can allow that just yet. You might simply dig your way out.

**SCP-6353-1:** //*snort*// If my nose were working yes, but without it I am blind. I do not know this place, I could be on the other side of the planet. Without smell, I need to know exactly where I am and where I am going, or I could emerge under water, or into magma.

**Agent McCallion:** Interesting, so you have to calculate the journey ahead of time? 

**SCP-6353-1:** Yes. So long as I am kept ignorant of my location, I am trapped here. So the bonds are completely unnecessary. //*whine*//

**Agent McCallion:** I’ll speak to my supervisor about it.

**&lt;END LOG&gt;:**

**Closing Statement:** Post interview SCP-6353-1 remained bound in restraints. A sett was found at the coordinates given. 

SCP-6353-1 appears to have used high quality silk and cashmere clothing as bedding. The food had been stolen from a high-end supermarket. A small collection of round stones was found, most were not local to the area, but none appeared to be of extra-terrestrial origin.

There were also multiple appliances including a fridge, a microwave and multiple computers. Data retrieved from the computers was primarily focused on the study of exoplanets and the evolution of mammals on Earth.

**Second interview with SCP-6353-1**
**Date:** 19/07/2020
**Interviewed:** SCP-6353-1
**Interviewer:** Agent McCallion
----
**&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;:**

**Agent McCallion:** Hello, I trust you are feeling more comfortable now?

**SCP-6353-1:** //*squeak*// Yes, thank you Agent McCallion. Though if these are to be my permanent quarters, I should like to request some alterations.

**Agent McCallion:** We might be able to accommodate that. But for the moment there are other matters we must discuss.

**SCP-6353-1:** You found my sett?

**Agent McCallion:** Yes, thank you again for being so cooperative. You mentioned that your people, “The Broc” would reward us for assisting you.

**SCP-6353-1:** We look after our own. We are not as quick to abandon one another as //*snort*// other species might. Anyone would assists a Broc in peril will be granted a boon. Anyone who assisted one of my standing, could expect a great deal.

**Agent McCallion:** Could you teach us to travel through space as you do?

**SCP-6353-1:** //*squeak*// //*squeak*// No, it cannot be taught. We are born with it. You cannot claim our power, but we might use it on your behalf. With our help you might rebuild the British Empire.

**Agent McCallion:** I think you are under a misapprehension, I do not act for the British government, or any government.

**SCP-6353-1:** //*snort*// A corporation then? A religion? The Illuminati?

**Agent McCallion:** I work for the Foundation. We exist to contain anomalous objects, entities, and phenomena. Our jurisdiction is anything which defies explanation.

**SCP-6353-1:** And what //*snort*// do you do with the anomalous?

**Agent McCallion:** Containment procedures vary, most physical objects are locked away.

**SCP-6353-1:** //*snort*// It would be a mistake to imprison me. I will be no threat to your species, or to normalcy, if I were to return to my people.

**Agent McCallion:** But we have only your word on that. How are we to know you wouldn’t return with an army?

**SCP-6353-1:** //*squeak*// We have no need for your squalid little planet! Do you think Broc would wish to raise cubs amongst your poison and pestilence? Why would we bother when there are better worlds for which we don’t need to fight?

**Agent McCallion:** Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing if you are lying to us.

**SCP-6353-1:** We do not betray! I am honourable! //*snort*// You dare to accuse me of lies?

**Agent McCallion:** Calm down, please. Try to look at things from our perspective, we have to be cautious.

**SCP-6353-1:** //*growl*//

**Agent McCallion:** I’m not saying we won’t help you, but we need to be careful. Perhaps we can work something out. Let me speak to my superiors.
**&lt;END LOG&gt;:**

**Closing Statement:**
“It may be possible to make use of SCP-6353-1 to transport personnel and materials at the equivalent of FTL speeds. If SCP-6353-1 can be induced to co-operate it may prove a useful asset. 

I recommend agreeing to search for its planet of origin in exchange for service to the Foundation.&#34;- Agent Michael McCallion

**Site 91 Interdepartmental Meeting**
**Date:** 03/08/2010
Only the section of the meeting pertinent to SCP-6353-1 is included in this report.
----

**[REDACTED]:** Next item is SCP-6353, has everyone had a chance to look over Agent McCallion’s report?

**Agent Kohli:** A lot of the teleport systems we use have some nasty side-effects. If SCP-6353-1 can be controlled, I’m all for it.

**[REDACTED]:** But can it be properly controlled? This is a recently acquired entity, we cannot yet be certain of its abilities or its motivations.

**Professor Mairns:** As far as we can see SCP-6353-1 is a standard badger, aside from its anomalous features, its biology appears completely standard, sedatives and amnestics work perfectly on it.

**[REDACTED]:** And the injuries it claimed to sustain from a terrestrial badger?

**Professor Mairns:** They seem genuine, the damage to the snout is particularly bad and could certainly cause loss of smell. Were termination required, a bullet to the skull would be effective. 

**[REDACTED]:** Are you in favour of the proposal?

**Professor Mairns:** At the very least, I believe we should use it as a pretext for some further experimentation, allowing us to monitor the warping process in a controlled environment.

**[REDACTED]:** We’ll go ahead with testing, should it prove to be everything we hope, we can move forward. However, there is our side of the bargain; can we find SCP-6353-1’s planet of origin? And if so, would it be in our interest to share that information?

**Agent Franks:** Assuming its story is true, we have to weigh up two worst case scenarios:

A. SCP-6353-1 is lying, we send it home and trigger an invasion of Earth and the destruction of humanity.

B. SCP-6353-1 is telling the truth, we keep it prisoner until others of its kind find us, at which point they take revenge via an invasion of Earth and the destruction of humanity.

**[REDACTED]:** Hmm. In any event, finding the planet is likely to take some time, time in which we will monitor SCP-6353-1. Should we ever find it, we can make a decision then. I think we should agree to help SCP-6353-1, but the research… need not be high priority.

**Professor Mairns:** Do you want to put some of our people on it, or run it through an outside group?

**[REDACTED]:** Hmm... let’s give it to the IAU.[[footnote]]Interstellar Anomalies Unit[[/footnote]] I believe their efforts would be, ahem, adequate to the task.

**&lt;END LOG&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** SCP-6353-1 was relocated to Site-207. Requests to use SCP-6353-1 to be managed through Agent Durmaz.

**IAU Meeting**
**Date:** 20/08/2010
**Present: Dr. Kowal Co-Director of IAU, Dr. Warner Co-Director of IAU, Agent Durmaz, Agent Horne, SCP-6353-1**
----

**&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;:**

**Agent Durmaz:** With your permission, I will give Agent Horne the greenlight.

**Dr. Kowal:** Yes, we’re ready.

**Agent Durmaz:** Agent Horne we are clear on this end.

//Over phone//**Agent Horne**: Alright, stand clear.

//SCP-6353-1 emerges into the meeting room from a portal, followed by Agent Horne who has to crawl due to the size of the portal//

**Dr. Warner:** Fascinating! 

**Agent Durmaz:** Doctors, this is SCP-6353-1, and this-

**Agent Horne:** Let me get off the floor before you introduce me.

**Agent Durmaz:** …is Agent Horne.

**Dr. Kowal:** Hello SCP-6353-1, welcome to Site 207.

**Dr. Warner:** Yes, welcome, yes. So you don’t experience any ill effects from the warped space?

**Agent Horne:** Not after the first few times, only problem is the lack of dignity.

**SCP-6353-1:** There is nothing undignified about using four limbs. //*snort*// Who is in charge here?

**Dr. Kowal:** Dr Warner and I are joint heads of the IAU.

**SCP-6353-1:** That is unfortunate. In my experience such partnerships are usually very //*snort*// tenuous. 

**Dr Warner:** I think it works well, we help to balance each other out. We have different specialties.

**SCP-6353-1:** Which of you will be responsible for finding my home?

**Dr Warner:** Well, we won’t personally be carrying out much of the research, we mostly handle administration these days. 

**Dr. Kowal:** Ultimately, we share responsibility. Hopefully this arrangement will benefit everyone.

**Agent Durmaz:** It’s key that it does. Remember SCP-6353-1, if your work for us isn’t satisfactory the research stops.

**SCP-6353-1:** I am not a child! //*snort*//I have made a bargain and I will fulfil it. My kind do not break their oaths. It is your species which constantly lies, //*snort*// I should be the one to fear betrayal!

**Dr Warner:** Let’s calm down. I’m sure SCP-6353-1 will prove itself to be very valuable. If I may say, the possibilities you open up to us are astounding.

**SCP-6353-1:** //*squeak*// Which are you: Kowal or Warner?

**Dr Warner:** I am Doctor Warner, this is Doctor Kowal.

**SCP-6353-1:** I look forward to working with you. You may call me by my name rather than your designation. Translated to English, it is Milk Of The Earth, or Milk From The Soil.

**Dr Kowal:** Ha! I’m sorry, I&#39;m so sorry, I didn’t mean to laugh. It’s just, back in the sixties I was in a band called Milk Of The Earth. M.O.T.E for short.

**Dr Warner:** I thought your band was called Gaia’s Vandals?

**Dr Kowal:** That was after. M.O.T.E broke up due to some political differences. Half of us became Gaia’s Vandals, the others became The Lunar Pacifists. 

**Agent Horne:** Heh, Mote.

**SCP-6353-1:** //*snort*// Have you been given my work so far?

**Dr Warner:** Yes, yes. Using spectroscopy to match the smells of planets is a very interesting approach, although I think we have equipment a little better than you were using. I can show you if you like?

**SCP-6353-1:** //*squeak*// Yes, thank you Dr Warner, that is a most kind offer.

**Dr Kowal:** Hello Milk Of The Earth, how can I help you?

**SCP-6353-1:** I would like to complain about… //*sniff*// you have raspberries.

**Dr Kowal:** You want to complain about me having raspberries?

**SCP-6353-1:** No, no, I just smelled them and it put me off track. 

**Dr Kowal:** I grew them myself, would you like some?

**SCP-6353-1:** //*squeak*// That is very kind of you. I find raspberries to be the silver lining of this dismal planet.

//Dr Kowal removes a plastic tub of raspberries from her bag, and empties the contents into a bowl, from which SCP-6353-1 begins feeding//

**Dr Kowal:** Have as many as you like. Though, I thought you couldn’t smell anymore?

**SCP-6353-1:** My olfactory sense has not been destroyed, though it is greatly diminished. I can sense my immediate surroundings, but no further. //*whine*// Once I could smell distant stars, now I can barely reach beyond two metres.

**Dr Kowal:** I imagine that must be very difficult for you. Do your people have ways to repair the damage?

**SCP-6353-1:** I believe so, but I have never been interested in medicine.

**Dr Kowal:** Once you’re done, we can go to  Dr Warner&#39;s office to discuss an idea he&#39;s had to-

//Agent Horne enters the room//

**Agent Horne:** Sorry to intrude Dr Kowal, but I need SCP-6353-1.

**SCP-6353-1:** //*snort*// I am eating.

**Dr Warner:** Our best tools for finding your home are space telescopes, but there are relatively few of them because of the cost involved. However, with your help we would be able to get some into space without the need for expensive rocket launches.

**SCP-6353-01:** An interesting idea Dr Warner, but I cannot survive in the vacuum any better than you can. We smell planets with suitable atmospheres and tunnel directly to them.

**Dr Warner:** Ah, yes, I thought about that. I’d like to arrange for us to build you a specialised space suit. That way you and some human personal will be able to make repeat trips with small sections of a telescope and assemble it in space.

**SCP-6353-01:** //*squeak*// That may work. How long until the space suit and telescope can be deployed?

**Dr Warner:** Oh, well I only just had the idea yesterday. It’ll probably take a few weeks to design the suit, months for the telescope. We might be ready to deploy in a year or two

**SCP-6353-01:** //*snort*// So long?

**Dr Warner:** I’m sorry Mote, but these things take time. 

**SCP-6353-01:** //*whine*// 

**Dr Warner:** Come on, we’re doing the best we can. I know it isn’t everything you would like, but at least we have a chance.

**SCP-6353-01:** Yes, I suppose you are right. //*whine*// In the meantime, may I make a request?

**Dr Warner:** Of course.

**SCP-6353-01:** I do not care for the //*snort*// nickname. Please either use my full name, or the official human designation.

**Dr Warner:** Oh, I’m sorry, I didn&#39;t realise it bothered you.

**SCP-6353-01:** Well it does. Amongst the Broc I am treated with great respect. This term //*snort*// “Mote”, is below my dignity.

**Dr Warner:** I promise I won’t use it again.

**SCP-6353-01:** Thank you.

**Dr Warner:** While we’re discussing personal matters, have you or any of your species come into contact with something called a Voruteut?[[footnote]][https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6240 SCP-6240][[/footnote]] Something with vast psychic power, something which eats stars? The Ortothans have-

**SCP-6353-01:** What does it smell like?

**Dr Warner:** Well, uh... I don’t know.

**SCP-6353-01:** Then I cannot help you.

**Dr Warner:** Oh, I guess that makes sense. So you’ve never…

**SCP-6353-01:** Broc do not spend their time fighting or trading with other species. We do not care for the hassle. If something like that threatened us we would simply move away.

**Dr Warner:** Yeah, that figures. Nevermind, I knew it was a long shot.

**SCP-6353-1:** //*snort*// Agent Durmaz, does the Foundation permit its staff to ruin themselves?

**Agent Durmaz:** What do you mean?

**SCP-6353-1:** It seems to me that an organisation such as this would seek to prevent workers from rendering themselves unfit for service.

**Agent Durmaz:** We have very strict procedures in place to protect staff, especially those at high risk from anomalies. Accidents will always happen but we try to minimise them.

**SCP-6353-1:** What if it isn&#39;t an accident? If a member of staff was found to be self-harming or abusing heroin, would-

**Agent Horne:** You are not bringing this up again.

**SCP-6353-1:** //*squeak*// -would you intervene Agent Durmaz?

**Agent Durmaz:**  //*sigh*// In those cases yes, however, some discretion is permitted, for example, smoking cigarettes-

**SCP-6353-1:** She is poisoning herself! If she is too stupid or weak willed to stop then you should make her!

**Agent Horne:** I can smoke if I like! It&#39;s no one’s business but mine! Not Durmaz&#39;s, not the Foundation&#39;s and certainly not yours!

**Agent Durmaz:** Calm down Horne.

**SCP-6353-1:** //*snort*// It certainly is my business when I&#39;m forced to endure that disgusting stench.

**Agent Durmaz:** SCP-6353-1 that&#39;s enough. She can smoke if she likes and I&#39;m not going to stop her.

**SCP-6353-1:** So it&#39;s fine for her to pollute herself? My life depends on her actions. If she is too busy coughing up tumours-

**Agent Durmaz:**  I said enough! All agents have regular medical checks, if she were not fit for the job she wouldn&#39;t have it.

**SCP-6353-1:** //*snort*// Your fondness for Horne has clouded your judgement. I insist that she be reassigned and a competent replacement brought in.

**Agent Horne:**  Fuck you!

**Agent Durmaz:** Horne! Don&#39;t rise to the bait. Request denied SCP-6353-1, you are out of line.

**Closing Statement:** SCP-6353-1 was recovered near Bonnybridge, UK. 

Whilst surveying the surrounding area five granite slabs in a circular formation were found. The remains of a badger was found buried in the centre. Cause of death judged to be blunt force trauma to the skull. SCP-6353-1 identified this as the badger which damaged its snout.

SCP-6353-1 was kept off of active deployment for three days, during which it was restrained in its holding cell. At Agent Durmaz’s request SCP-6353-1 was assigned twice weekly sessions with psychiatrist Dr Pascal.

**Questioning of SCP-6353-1** 
**Date:** 18/11/2010
**Interviewed:** SCP-6353-1
**Interviewer:** Agent Pink
----
**&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;**

**Agent Pink:** Hello I&#39;m Agent Pink, I am running the Inquest into the death of Agent Horne. We need to go over what happened yesterday.

**SCP-6353-1:** Hello, I&#39;m sorry we had to meet under these circumstances Agent Pink.

**Agent Pink:** Yes, unfortunately I&#39;ve have to deal with dozens of cases like this. I&#39;ll need to hear your account of the events, we need to understand what went wrong.

**SCP-6353-1:** I have already explained several times. I’m sure you have access to the recordings.

**Agent Pink:** I do, but I also need to hear it first-hand. That&#39;s the proceedure; I’m reinterviewing everyone.

**SCP-6353-1:** Very well. I was working with Dr Warner when Agent Durmaz advised I was needed. MTF Beta-777 was preparing for a dangerous mission, I was to be on standby in case they needed an extraction.

**Agent Pink:** And this is something that you have done before?

**SCP-6353-1:** Yes, usually without difficulty. I was given the coordinates of the extraction point and waited. One hour and twenty-three minutes later the call came in and I tunnelled through.

**Agent Pink:** And Agent Horne went with you?

**SCP-6353-1:** Yes, Agent Durmaz had come on the previous mission. They would rotate you see, so it was Agent Horne’s turn to assist me.

**Agent Pink:** What did you think of Agent Horne?

**SCP-6353-1:** There had been some difficulties in the past, we did not enjoy each other socially but we had no problems during assignments. 

**Agent Pink:** I’ve seen some documents suggesting you had quite a few arguments with Agent Horne since you joined us.

**SCP-6353-1:** //*snort*// We had some disagreements, but I believe we were coming to understand each other better. Agent Durmaz had disciplined Agent Horne and I had some useful conversations with Dr Pascal. It is tragic, //*whine*// we were just beginning to see the possibility of friendship... then the accident happened.

**Agent Pink:** We should talk about the accident. You successfully rendezvoused with MTF Beta-777 ?

**SCP-6353-1:** Yes, the situation was very dangerous and we needed to leave immediately. Some of them were badly injured. I opened the tunnel, the team followed me, and Agent Horne was to follow them.

**Agent Pink:** But Agent Horne did not follow them.

**SCP-6353-1:** No, no she didn’t.

**Agent Pink:** Why didn’t she?

**SCP-6353-1:** I’m afraid I don’t know. //*whine*// We had practiced the procedure many times and she was always very good at that sort of thing.

**Agent Pink:** I understand the rule was that you were to wait for a signal before closing the tunnel. A signal from Agent Horne.

**SCP-6353-1:** Yes, and I thought she gave that signal.

**Agent Pink:** Thought?

**SCP-6353-1:** It was a difficult environment, there was a lot of noise and smoke. At the time I was sure I heard Agent Horne given the signal.

**Agent Pink:** You seem to have some doubts now.

**SCP-6353-1:** Well, when we got back, Agent Durmaz was quite insistent that the signal wasn’t given. I expect you have the records which will advise either way.

**Agent Pink:** I do. They back up Agent Durmaz. The portal stayed open until the last of MTF Beta-777 entered, then closed. Agent Horne never gave the signal.

**SCP-6353-1:** I see. So the fault is mine. //*whine*// 

**Agent Pink:** Can you explain why you closed the portal early?

**SCP-6353-1:** //*whine*// I don’t know. I thought I heard the signal.

**Agent Pink:** I’ll need more than that SCP-6353-1. An agent is dead. You abandoned her, left her alone with a dangerous anomaly. We need a reason, and if you ever want out of those restraints it had better be a good one.

**SCP-6353-1:** //*whine*// I don’t know. I don’t… oh

**Agent Pink:** //*sigh*// What?

**SCP-6353-1:** Well, it might not be relevant, but I have been forgetting things lately.

**Agent Pink:** Forgetting things?

**SCP-6353-1:** Yes, my memory is perfect, always has been. But the past few weeks I’ve been forgetting what day it was, or what I was doing. Sometimes I get a little confused. I told Doctor Pascal about it.

**Agent Pink:** And you think this played a role yesterday?

**SCP-6353-1:** Maybe. Maybe it’s those drugs you’ve been giving me, when I’m sent on missions and then need to forget about them.

**Agent Pink:** You’re proposing the amnestics caused this?

**SCP-6353-1:** It’s possible.

**Agent Pink:** Your blood was tested yesterday and no trace of amnestics was found. Brain scans showed no sign of damage.

**SCP-6353-1:** But your scans can’t tell why I am smarter than a badger. So perhaps they wouldn’t be able to spot this kind of damage.

**Agent Pink:** That sounds very convenient to me. 

**SCP-6353-1:** //*snort*//

**Agent Pink:** Agent Durmaz thinks you left her behind deliberately. That you hated Agent Horne and wanted to kill her. She says you’re a murderer.

**SCP-6353-1:** She is wrong. //*snort*// Agent Durmaz is in shock, she needs time to grieve, to come to her senses. They were like sisters you see. I know what it’s like to lose to a sister.

**&lt;END LOG&gt;:**

**Closing statement:** Dr Pascal confirmed SCP-6353-1 had reported memory loss in the past month. Although highly suspicious, it is not possible to prove SCP-6353-1 had malicious intent. 

SCP-6353-1 is to be confined for thirty days and not permitted on any missions for a further thirty days. No further research into SCP-6353 home planet is to be conducted during this time. 

The death of Agent Laura Horne is be attributed to SCP-4612-B.[[footnote]][https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4612 SCP-4612][[/footnote]]

**Dr Kowal:** Have you had a chance to read Agent Pink’s report?

**Dr Warner:** //*sigh*// Yeah. Do you think…

**Dr Kowal:** Maybe. They never got on and SCP-6353-1 has always had a temper.

**Dr Warner:** Yeah, but that doesn’t make it a murderer does it? Fluv used to be just as grumpy.

**Dr Kowal:** I don’t know. How much do we really know about SCP-6353-1? Whenever I talk to it there’s this feeling of… distance. Like it’s holding back. Like it’s trying to play me.

**Dr Warner:** To be fair, that’s to be expected. Put yourself in its shoes; you’re stranded on another planet and imprisoned by aliens, aren’t you going to be wary of trusting them?

**Dr Kowal:** That’s fair. 

**Dr Warner:** I feel terrible about Agent Horne, I do, and if there was foul play SCP-6353-1 is the obvious suspect. But everyone makes mistakes, I certainly have.

**Dr Kowal:** So you trust it?

**Dr Warner:** I wouldn’t go that far, but I’m open to the idea that this was an accident.

**Dr Kowal:** I suppose we might all just be looking for someone to blame.

**Dr Warner:** Yeah.

**Dr Kowal:** Or maybe there’s more to this. Maybe we need to look deeper.

**Dr Warner:** Edna…

**Dr Kowal:** Good morning Agent McCallion.

**Agent McCallion:** Hello Dr Kowal, I&#39;d say good morning but it’s actually evening over here.

**Dr Kowal:** Ah, of course it is. I’ll try not to keep you.

**Agent McCallion:** It’s quite alright. This was about SCP-6353-1 wasn’t it?

**Dr Kowal:** That’s right, just a couple of things from your report I wanted to go over.

**Agent McCallion:** Anything I can do to help. Is it giving you trouble?

**Dr Kowal:** It… it might be nothing, but I need to be sure. There were some stones found at SCP-6353-1&#39;s sett.

**Agent McCallion:** Aye, nothing unusual about them, except the variety I suppose. Our geologist said they were all terrestrial, nothing anomalous.

**Dr Kowal:** Did SCP-6353-1 explain them?

**Agent McCallion:** Said it was just a hobby, that it picked up stones wherever it went, mementos I guess.

**Dr Kowal:** Hmm...

**Agent McCallion:** I haven’t missed something here have I?

**Dr Kowal:** No, no Agent McCallion, that all seems normal enough. I’m just wondering why SCP-6353-1 hasn’t done the same since we picked it up. We’ve allowed it personal affects, but it hasn’t brought any stones here to Site 207.

**Agent McCallion:** ...okay...

**Dr Kowal:** I also wanted to ask you about the badger corpse you found. 

**Agent McCallion:** Right, SCP-6353-1 identified that as the, um, Earth badger which injured its nose. Apparently SCP-6353-1 thought it was intelligent and tried to communicate, and the badger attacked. The vet said the wounds corresponded with being inflicted by a badger.

**Dr Kowal:** Isn’t it odd though, for badgers to fight to the death like that? Not that I’m an expert.

**Agent McCallion:** Yeah, the vet did mention that, maybe the Broc take things more seriously. 

**Dr Kowal:** Hmm, maybe. One last question: what did you make of Professor Tanaka’s belief that there might be more SCP-6353 on Earth?

**Agent McCallion:** It was a concern, with their abilities they could come and go at their leisure and avoid detection. We&#39;ve put out a notice for increased vigilance and are harvesting data from all known civilian badger watchers. We’ve also invested in a widespread program of tagging badgers under the guise of conservation. No unusual behaviour or significant changes in population have been noticed.

**Dr Kowal:** So you don’t put any credence in Tanaka’s claim?

**Agent McCallion:** Maybe if he’d actually seen another one, or heard SCP-6353-1 communicating with one. But you’ve got to take Tanaka’s condition into account, he was in a stressful situation, could have imagined it, or misheard.

**Dr Kowal:** Yes, yes you’re quite right. Ok then. 

**Agent McCallion:** If there’s anything else you need just let me know.

**Dr Kowal:** Could you have all the materials shipped over to Site 207? The computers, the stones, the badger.

**Agent McCallion:** Of course, I’ll see to it in the morning.

**Dr Kowal:** I don’t want to be a pain, but could you get started today? 

**Agent McCallion:** Yes, sorry, right away.

**Dr Kowal:** Hello Milk Of The Earth, how are you?

**SCP-6353-1:** //*snort*// I am falsely imprisoned Dr Kowal, which is not conducive to a good temperament.

**Dr Kowal:** I know, I&#39;m very sorry things have turned out this way. But it won&#39;t be for long.

**SCP-6353-1:** I find this situation to be a farce. If I am believed guilty I should be punished, that is right. //*snort*// If I am believed innocent I should be free. Agent Pink&#39;s recommendations make no sense.

**Dr Kowal:** I&#39;ve been working for the Foundation for decades, and a lot of its decisions still leave me confused.

**SCP-6353-1:** I believe this may have been deliberately orchestrated. //*snort*// An attempt to make me timid and afraid. You want me meek and grateful, happily transporting your troops. //*snort*// All the while you impede my work, stalling and delaying, preventing me from ever returning home. Perhaps you have already found it and withhold the fact so that you can retain me as a beast of burden.

**Dr Kowal:** It wouldn&#39;t surprise me, the Foundation has done far worse. But I&#39;m not involved in anything like that, at least not knowingly. Dr Warner and I have been sincerely trying to help you.

**SCP-6353-1:** I have been sincere, you see the results. //*snort*// I have answered every question put to me, performed every task given to me-

**Dr Kowal:** Speaking of questions, there are some I&#39;d like to ask.

**SCP-6353-1:** //*snort*// Must I explain Agent Horne&#39;s death once again?

**Dr Kowal:** No, it isn&#39;t about that. It&#39;s about these.

//Dr Kowal removes a plastic tub from her bag. The tub contains the stones found in SCP-6353-1&#39;s sett.//

**SCP-6353-1:** Rocks?

**Dr Kowal:** Yes, your rocks. They were found in your sett in Scotland, do you recognise them?

//Dr Kowal empties the stones onto a table and spreads them out.//

**SCP-6353-1:** //*squeak*// They are just stones, I took a fancy to them as I explored your planet.

**Dr Kowal:** I see, so there isn&#39;t anything special about them?

**SCP-6353-1:** Nothing particular, I liked the way they felt. Without smell I tried to make more use of my other senses.

**Dr Kowal:** So you started collecting them after your snout was damaged?

**SCP-6353-1:** Yes, does it matter?

**Dr Kowal:** It matters a great deal SCP-6353-1.

//Dr Kowal exits the room and returns pushing a cart. On the cart are the remains of a dead badger.//

**SCP-6353-1:** //*snort*// Have you lost your mind? Why are you bringing that in here?

**Dr Kowal:** I thought I should organise a reunion. You identified it as the Earth badger which damaged your nose.

**SCP-6353-1:** I killed it in self defence! //*snort*//

**Dr Kowal:** Maybe. But there&#39;s something about your story that doesn&#39;t add up. You see this?

//Dr Kowal lifts a blue stone from the table//

**Dr Kowal:** This is Azurite. A fairly soft stone, found in North America, Africa, Australia... but not in Scotland.

**SCP-6353-1:** //*growl*//

**Dr Kowal:** So, Mote, why did we find traces of Azurite on this badgers corpse?

**SCP-6353-1:** //*growl*//

**Dr Kowal:** You didn&#39;t find this stone before you killed this badger, you had it the whole time. This Azurite didn&#39;t come from Earth, and neither did this badger!

**SCP-6353-1:** //*snort*// You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about!

**Dr Kowal:** You killed a member of your own kind, didn&#39;t you?

**SCP-6353-1:** No!

**Dr Kowal:** One of the astronomers heard you say &#34;WE should never have come here&#34;.

**SCP-6353-1:** That means nothing!

**Dr Kowal:** It was your sister wasn&#39;t it?

**SCP-6353-1:** How...? No!

//Dr Kowal shows SCP-6353-1 a photograph//

**Dr Kowal:** This is a pattern of stones which sat above the grave, looks like a lot of effort to memorialise some “unthinking brute”.

**SCP-6353-1:** //*growl*//

**Dr Kowal:** You killed your own sister. Why did you do it? Did she damage your sensitive ego? Did she refuse to flatter you? To coddle you? Is that all it takes for you to murder your own family?

**SCP-6353-1:** She was the proud one! //*snort*// She thought she was better than everyone! She was going to steal the glory like she always did! For once I wanted the fame, the prestige, the honour! Just once! //*snort*// But she would never let that happen.

**Dr Kowal:** So while you were alone, far beyond the reach of your people, you smashed her skull.

**SCP-6353-1:** //*growl*//

**Dr Kowal:** And Agent Horne?

**SCP-6353-1:** //*growl*//

**Dr Kowal:** Did you kill Agent Horne!

**SCP-6353-1:** No.

**Dr Kowal:** I don&#39;t believe you.

**SCP-6353-1:** //*snort*// Tough.

**Dr Kowal:** What about this then? This was the only piece of evidence against you, you could have dropped it in the ocean, but instead you kept it close. Why?

**SCP-6353-1:** //*snort*// I&#39;m sentimental.

**Dr Kowal:** I&#39;m told this is an unusually fragile piece of Azurite. Is that deliberate? What would happen if I-

**SCP-6353-1:** Don&#39;t!

**Dr Kowal:** Then tell me what is it!

**SCP-6353-1:** It is a weapon, break it and we will all die!

**Dr Kowal:** Bullshit. Tell me the truth or I smash it right now!

**SCP-6353-1:** //*snort*// It is an emergency signal. To my people.

**Dr Kowal:** That seem more likely. So you kept it for emergencies, but tried to get home without it, because... because you didn&#39;t want them to find out what you did to her.

**SCP-6353-1:** //*snort*// Yes.

**Dr Kowal:** Good. Now tell me the truth about Agent Horne or I break it.

**SCP-6353-1:** //*snort*// I didn&#39;t kill her!

**Dr Kowal:** ...liar.

//Dr Kowal throws the stone to the floor and crushes it with her foot.//

//This file is seen by **The Gathered** and judgment is made. Humans cannot be trusted, their words are often false, but the same can be true of **The Broc**. In this case it is agreed that Milk Of The Earth is a liar and a murderer.
At the dawn of her greatest discovery, our beloved **Tooth Of The Water** was betrayed by her own blood. Her body is given the honours of a champion and her memory is celebrated at each **Feast Of Heroes**.
The murderer is punished by **The Way Of The Third Angel**.
These events bring shame to us, but must not be forgotten.
**Doctor Edna Kowal** is returned to her people with the gratitude of **The Broc** and charged with delivering our message to **Humanity**:
&#34;We wish no quarrel with **mankind**, the planet Earth is yours and you may keep it. Yet you must not be reckless. Though far removed they may be, the **Badgers** of your world are likely our own kin. We reserve the right to study our past and it is our responsibility to ensure the protection of our distant relations. Should these interests be threatened, **The Broc** are entitled to intervene.&#34;//
