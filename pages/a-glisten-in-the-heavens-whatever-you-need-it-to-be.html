Look to your left. Look to your right. What do you see? Nothing, that´s what. There´s no light in here. So you make some, and it floats to the mossy ceiling, splashing against it and sending luminous drops of photons across the stone-brick room like oil, oil like a painting as the drops swirl around each other like an illustrious waltz that sheds its droplets to reveal a hallway in front of you. It is magic. Not magic like in books, where a bunch of children wave around some sticks and throw fire, but real magic. Magic that is wild but can be tamed, magic that is free and conscious but also a mindless stream. Like light, you think, as your shining drips of oil begin to slow their dance and settle. Light, yes- the science folk say it is two things at once. It´s a nice thought, however true it may be. You begin walking down the hallway, anxious for what is on the other end.

You are the child of the King, and the King is the child of the land. At least, that is what your father- a cryptic sort of man- would tell you when you were younger and your opinions on hierarchy and monarchy were unstable at best. And you´ve noticed that as you become more experienced, you understand just what he meant a little more each year. But you can´t ask him now the entirety of what he meant. He is in a deep coma from the effects of a foreign virus that was last recorded nearly a thousand years ago. That´s why your magic is running down the walls of this old stone hallway- you are looking for an outdated tome, regarded outdated because nearly half of its listed diseases no longer exist- or, you think, perhaps more have been rediscovered than that affecting your father. What could the unearthing of this medical journal bring to science folk of your country? There is a room ahead, marked by an arch built of silver and copper, now rusted and oxidated, metallic flecks brought to the ground over the centuries due to erosion. You kick these bits to the side and walk into this abandoned library, to reveal...

A corpse lies rotting in the center of the circular room, but some bits of flesh still cling to it, meaning they´ve been here after the library shut down. No doubt another visitor looking for something within these worn shelves and mildewed pages. You walk around it and begin searching the shelves, scanning the Latin writings on the pages for anything resembling a medical text. Words like ´Bile´ and ´Blood´ are found, but your father is not troubled cardiovascularly nor in the liver. His ailment is that of the lungs and throat, so you look for those words. It is not long before you find a leather-bound book labeled ´Respiratory Illnesses and their Cures´. A crisp //crunch// can be heard as you remove the book from where it is, a cloud of dust billowing from the empty slot between the books as you scrape spiderwebs off of the cover, and it //crunch//es again when you open it. Sure enough, the table of contents, nearly untouched, speaks of your father´s ailment. Just then, the corpse in the center of the room begins to stir.

This is, of course, necromancy, a beaten and bruised form of magic that turns on its captors and everyone who does not free it from its rotting, unwilling host. This is only made worse by the fact that necromancy is only created by using the trapped magic to cage the host´s soul, disrupting the Stream of Life with every usage. It is your duty to destroy the host in this situation so that both the soul and the magic can return to their respective recycling diety, restoring the balance in the universe that had been slightly offput by their absence. So you draw your sword and begin to stride towards the corpse.

There is a distinct //creak// with every step the skeleton takes, its tibias and fibulas clacking together under unsupported weight. A bit of bone on the bottom of its eye socket crumbles off and it begins picking up speed in its walk. You slash at it when it gets close enough, and you chop through the ribs. In a living person, this would be an immediately fatal blow, but as it has no stomach, lungs, or diaphragm in that area, the broken-off rib bones simply clatter to the floor. The skeleton does not seem happy, however much it might be able to convey such a sentiment. It takes a sword from an old, frayed scabbard at its hip. Now you´ve got a real fight and a harder one at that- no chest strikes or head blows will work in this scenario. Your best bet is its legs, then destroying the rest of the bones from there. You swipe at the legs, but it parries skillfully. It counterattacks by twisting its untethered spine and nicking your shoulder. You suck your teeth in pain and swipe at its spine, which bends away immediately. However, you knew this would happen- and you go down, cracking its pelvis apart and making the corpse collapse to the ground. You´ve won, and it´s time to leave. A burst of purple and a burst of white emanate from the skeleton, meaning the magic and the soul have been freed. This beam shoots through the ceiling of the crypt and is still flying upwards when you leave- a symbol of luck, perhaps, or an omen of hope.

You´ve lived on the edge of something or other for your entire life. As an infant, your family lived in a cliffside house, a beautiful cabin that watched the sun return to its slumber every night- at least, that´s all you can remember. Your siblings, God rest their souls, used to tell you that there were problems between your parents even before they died. After the loss of said parents, you moved to another edge- that of civilization, that of people´s minds. An orphanage, of course, and not one of quality. The caretakers were not paid nearly enough, but they still loved you and took care of you. That you could remember if nothing else. There is one that still swims to mind every now and again- Henrietta, a large woman in the form of muscular strength; 40-something years old. She would sing you some old lullaby when you were restless in her grandparents´ language and could coax even your wildest brother out of his unhinged bouts of anger if the need showed itself, and show itself it did many a time. You left the orphanage at 15 with the rest of your siblings, who had waited until the youngest turned 13.

That year, a plague swept the land and the oldest of your siblings shut you, a sister one year older, and the youngest brother two years younger than you in an abandoned shack (of course, the edge of society once again) and went out to do whatever it was they did- whether it was a quick job cleaning something, the of-age ones doing things that they wouldn&#39;t at the time dare mention around such young ears as yours, and sometimes even stealing a loaf of bread here and a bag of apples there. There were four of those siblings- you had six siblings- and they all caught the sickness. Jeremy, the oldest, had it first. He was infected in prison after being caught trying to pickpocket a landlord. Olivia, the middle child out of all of you, died at 18, from a tavern keeper she washed mugs for. Then there was Hannah, whose death brought an understanding of what she did every day with those men and therefore was even sadder. Joseph died last out of those four after visiting a bar in another town to quiet his fear of the plague. How cruelly ironic. After that, you younger ones nearly starved out of fear, your sister and you finally being able to leave once the plague was declared over. The did the same things our late brothers and sisters had done, and you lived.

You and your remaining siblings split paths when you were 24, and you had to walk three villages over to the edge of the kingdom to finally find an apprenticeship with an old leatherworker- and you were suddenly on the edge of poverty. An upgrade from actually being //in// poverty, no doubt, but not a nice feeling, knowing that one misstep might send you falling right back into such desperate times. The leatherworker- his name was Carlos, a burly, mustached Spaniard, and he was alone, just like you. He was a wonderful friend, and you went on to get officially recognized by the kingdom as an artisan. Carlos cried for the first time since you had met him on that day, he was so proud. He succumbed to age before you opened your own shop, on the edge of the city. You wept that day and again the next, and his death felt harder than those of your siblings.

You never found a single person to love, but you always joked that you felt you were married to your customers. Every single one of them was interesting and kinder than life had been, but you could never remember them the next week, except for a small pair of twins named Alice and Lucas, both about 7, who would come in with their parents- magic folk, they were- every month on the second Lord´s day and purchase a tunic- whether for one of the twins or for one of the parents. That was how you knew someone was rich back then- not by wearing their wealth, but by using wealth to wear more. One time those kids gave you a drawing they made on an old, mildewed paper- a sketch of your slender build standing behind your table covered in leathers and furs, yourself wearing your old apron over a tattered cloth tunic, a smile on your already-wrinkled face. It was a good drawing. You´ve no idea where those kids are now, but you hope they´re doing just fine.

But now you find yourself laying on a hill, grass poking your back gingerly and the sun beginning to set just in the way it hit the clouds sixty-four years ago in a little hut on the edge of a cliff where seven children lived, although now you can´t remember where that city is anyways. Your hand, weak and knobbly, rests upon your midsection as the other stretches out and pushes its digits into the dirt, taking in its cold nature and basking in its texture. You can feel something coming, whether it´s old age or some sort of miracle, and you wonder to yourself if you´re happy with what you´ve done. You think you are. And about your siblings, their names also lost to history and to other people´s memories, and if they´re still alive.

And then a short burst of light comes from the ground about a half kilometer from where you sit, a brilliant white and purple beam sending itself towards the heavens. And you feel warmth on your cheek, a tear. And with that tear, you think of everyone you´ve ever cried for- your parents and your siblings and Carlos and yourself, and now this. This beautiful, unobtainable miracle, floating in the air and reaching for God´s gentle hands. Your own hand, the one laying on your abdomen, lifts itself and extends towards the light, beckoning it to continue. Perhaps a miracle has indeed come after all this time. You might just leave to the heavens with it.

And so you do.
