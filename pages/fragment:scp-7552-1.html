**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7552-1 and SCP-7552-2 are to be safely contained at their points of origin at Site-19 within their corresponding observation chambers. SCP-7552-2 is to be kept under constant vacuum to reduce variables when researching SCP-7552-1 and -2.

SCP-7552-3 and SCP-7552-4 have been effectively neutralized.

**Description:** SCP-7552 was the result of the now-defunct Project Mirage, a project commissioned to research, replicate, and create practical applications for the Holographic Universe Theory.

SCP-7552-1 is the collective term for a set of three 1m x 1m tempered glass plates. Each plate displays the quantum description of a solid 1-meter diameter graphite sphere encoded on its surface. This information is contained in a 2D geometric printed lattice. This lattice represents the uncollapsed waveforms of every particle within SCP-7552-2, as described by quantum mechanics.

SCP-7552-2 is the collective term for a set of solid 1-meter diameter graphite spheres that spontaneously appeared 3 meters above each iteration of SCP-7552-1 after it was printed. Each instance was carefully engineered to appear within a clear observation chamber held under vacuum.

SCP-7552-3 and SCP-7552-4 were iterations of SCP-7552-1 and SCP-7552-2, respectively, that were corrupted by an instance of SCP-2234-567, an anomalous printer virus.

**Addendum 7552.1 – Incident Surveillance Log**
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

= **VIDEO LOG**
----
**DATE:** 07/24/2022

**NOTE:** Video taken from the interior of SCP-7552-3’s research chamber.
----

[BEGIN LOG]

**TIME: 22:31:15** Dr. Lysander Hawthorne is seen entering the room and begins taking notes in a notebook. It is unclear how Dr. Hawthorne bypassed the chamber’s security system.

**TIME: 22:32:57** While Dr. Hawthorne is looking at the notebook, the surface of SCP-7552-3 begins to shift rapidly. Meanwhile, the Holographic Universe Simulation Program issues an alert, which is responded to by Technician ███████, who also notices Dr. Hawthorne’s presence on the security feed.

**TIME: 22:32:11** Dr. Hawthorne looks up from his notes and notices the shifting patterns on SCP-7552-3. His expression turns to confusion, which then shifts to fear. Dr. Hawthorne’s curiosity evidently outweighs his fear, and he begin to write quickly in his notebook.

**TIME: 22:32:37** Technician ███████ manages to reach Dr. Kozlov via the emergency line and informs him of the situation. On-site security forces are dispatched to Dr. Hawthorne’s location.

**TIME: 22:33:09** A thermal sensor monitoring SCP-7552-4’s containment chamber detects a dramatic spike in temperature on the surface of the containment chamber. Protocol “Event Horizon” automatically activates and the Site breach alarm begins.

**TIME: 22:33:10** Dr. Hawthorne is startled by the breach alarm and notices the activation of the modified Lang Scranton Stabilizer. Dr. Hawthorne scrambles to exit the room, but the door has re-locked per “Event Horizon” protocol. Dr. Hawthorne begins to panic and tug at the door, spewing various expletives.

**TIME: 22:33:13** SCP-7552-4 breaches containment as a strong burst of anomalous radiation melts through the wall of its chamber. No personnel are affected.

**TIME: 22:33:13** The Lang Scranton Stabilizer completes activation, opening up a dimensional rift that violently pulls SCP-7552-3 and Dr. Hawthorne through. As SCP-7552-3 passes the threshold of the rift, SCP-7552-4 blinks out of existence, presumably relocating to SCP-3001.

**TIME: 22:33:18** The Lang Scranton Stabilizer deactivates and the rift closes. The breach alarms is turned off and Site evacuation is cancelled.

-----

**NOTE:** In the aftermath of this event, all exploration and access to SCP-3001 has been halted. SCP-7552-3 and SCP-7552-4 have been deemed neutralized. Dr. Hawthorne’s motivations for wanting to study such a dangerous anomaly without proper safeguards remain unclear.

**Addendum 7552.2 – Project Update**

In the aftermath of the latest incident, Project Mirage has been permanently cancelled. Containment procedures for SCP-7552-1 and SCP-7552-2 have been revised, but no further research into applications of the Holographic Universe Theory is permitted.

A peculiar side-effect of this incident has been observed over the following 12 months, involving numerous packages that have arrived at Dr. Hawthorne&#39;s last known residential address. These packages all contain consumer products that are frequently advertised, including brand-name running shoes, jewelry, apparel, and appliances. The connection between these deliveries and SCP-7552 or SCP-3001 remains unclear.</textarea></pre>
