//Detailed below is a communication between Site-59 Director Charles Anborough and SCP-2400 Temporal Anomalies Adviser Thaddeus Xyank describing an urgent proposal regarding containment of SCP-2700.//

**Xyank:** You&#39;re fucking crazy.

**Anborough:** Good morning.

**Xyank:** You-are-//insane//.

**Anborough:** What you&#39;re saying has been hypothesized, tested, and proven, and is therefore boring.  My proposal, on the other hand-

**Xyank:** No, shut up for a moment.  This is stupid, deranged, //and// it&#39;s going to destroy the universe.

**Anborough:** //You&#39;re// calling //my// experiments stupid?  Also, destroy the universe?  Do you want me to print you a copy of my daily schedule?

**Xyank:** So help me, Chuck-

**Anborough:** It&#39;s going to work, Thad.  //It will work.//

**Xyank:** So you figured out what went wrong when Tesla made 2700, that&#39;s great, but you can&#39;t fix it.

**Anborough:** Why not?

**Xyank:** You can&#39;t disassemble the machine.

**Anborough:** 2700 can be converted into another TAER, it just-

**Xyank:** //You can&#39;t disassemble the machine.// The moment you do, you&#39;ll breach 2700-Omega, and we&#39;re on our merry way to YK town.

**Anborough:** If it&#39;s done precisely, that won&#39;t happen.

**Xyank:** //One// mistake, one tiny, minuscule error, and we&#39;re screwed.  There&#39;s no way we can be that precise.

**Anborough:** We can increase the safety margin, though.  The central components of 2700-3 have causal immunity to the temporal effects of Omega, we //reconstructed// that causal immunity with the TAER-

**Xyank:** That&#39;s spectacular, //we don&#39;t know how we did that.//

**Anborough:** But we know we can.  If we could establish the same kind of causal immunity, on a larger scale, around the whole device, we could-

**Xyank:** We don&#39;t have enough material to make a causal shell of that size.

**Anborough:** There are other ways to reach that result.

**Xyank:** ...What do you mean?

**Anborough:** I need one of your temporal sinks.

**Xyank:** You can&#39;t be serious.

**Anborough:** It would give us enough of a buffer to complete the process with reasonable safety.  Come to think of it, didn&#39;t you finish development of the XACTS at 64T?  I know you used data from 2400&#39;s dilation to perfect it...

**Xyank:** ...Okay, first of all, you&#39;d need at least four XACTS, arranged in a pyramidal orientation and centered around 2700-3, but...

**Anborough:** But?

**Xyank:** You think Overwatch is going to go for this?  It //might// work, but without some kind of test that doesn&#39;t involve jeopardizing the universe, they&#39;re never going to approve.

**Anborough:** Let&#39;s do that, then.

**Xyank:** ...What?

**Anborough:** We&#39;ll test it.

**Xyank:** And how the hell are we going to do that?

**Anborough:** Well, we didn&#39;t only figure out how to turn 2700 into the TAER...we also know how to do the reverse.

**Xyank:** ...Chuck, are you actually suggesting what I think-

**Anborough:** All the pieces are already sitting inside 2400.  We&#39;ll put in the sinks, close the door, then put everything together and take it apart again.  Thad, we&#39;re going to make another 2700.

**Proposal 2400-2700 Thaumiel-Ω is currently pending O5 approval.**
