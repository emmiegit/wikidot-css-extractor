**Item #:** SCP-7978

**Object Class:** Keter 

**Special Containment Procedures:** Though full containment of SCP-7978 was once theoretically possible, the Foundation was not made aware of its anomalous capabilities until it had affected over 10,000,000 people. As such, containment efforts of SCP-7978 will focus on decreasing the rate of contagion.

The mitigation of uncontained SCP-7978-A is carried out through the following measures:

* Clandestine censorship via Foundation webcrawlers.
* Countermeme 29-VEGETABILIS-PUER has been preemptively issued to all vulnerable staff.[[footnote]] (//&#34;Before you ask, releasing the countermeme to the general population is out of the question. That countermeme only works because it indirectly invokes the protection of a prominent Corbenese patron deity while working around the need for sacrifice. The more we spread it, the more likely that [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/three-moons-initiative-hub said deity&#39;s servants] will take notice. If you have been exposed to 29-VEGETABILIS-PUER more than five times, please report to my office for postmortem secrecy briefings.&#34;// - Director Naismith) [[/footnote]]
* Dr. Carl Grodin of Site-59 has volunteered to assume the public persona of &#34;Caleb Grabowsky, Jr.,&#34; a fictitious cartoonist claiming to be the creator of SCP-7978. Dr. Grodin claims that he created SCP-7978 &#34;during a very dark time of [his] life&#34; marked by anecdotes of severe trauma and psychological duress. As such, through press releases, social media, copyright litigation, and other platforms he uses his intellectual ownership to have as many uncontained manifestations of SCP-7978-A destroyed as possible.
* The containment of SCP-7978-Prime. (See Addendum 3)

Site-59 maintains a database of the information of all known SCP-7978-B. Locations with a high SCP-7978-B density will be given priority for the previous four points. 

Currently, 428 civilian buildings have been flagged as gathering points for SCP-7978-B, including secluded compounds of ascetics, convention centers, and every government building in ████████████. These locations are to be monitored closely by double agents.

]]

SCP-7978-C is kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-59. She is currently in a drug-induced coma and should only be awoken if SCP-7978-Prime attempts to breach containment. In this case, she is to be brought to SCP-7978-Prime&#39;s containment chamber and maintain contact with SCP-7978-Prime until the situation de-escalates.

SCP-7978-Prime is kept in a high-security containment cell on the same floor as SCP-7978-C. When not in use, the workstation containing SCP-7978-Prime should be kept in its lead-lined vault inner vault and removed from its power source. Instruments used to monitor SCP-7978-Prime are to be replaced daily to reduce the possibility of SCP-7978-A corruption.

**Description:** SCP-7978 is a self-propagating memetic pattern that originates from //It Is Indeed the Sausageboy!//, a cartoon series that first appeared on YouTube on 11/20/2015. 

The creator of the original cartoon is unknown. While the original was uploaded under the username ██████████████, this was the only video on the user&#39;s now-deleted channel. All attempts to trace the user&#39;s contact information have turned up corrupted data. All SCP-7978-A thereafter has been created by SCP-7978-B.

Everything pertaining to //It Is Indeed the Sausageboy!// is an ALPTRAUM-class infohazard with a 22% chance of turning an unprotected[[footnote]] (by 29-VEGETABILIS-PUER and other countermemes) [[/footnote]] --human subject-- sentient being[[footnote]] (See Addendum 1) [[/footnote]] into an instance of SCP-7978-B.

SCP-7978-A denotes every concept that relates to the Sausageboy. This includes:
* The names and descriptions of the five central characters.
* Descriptions of episodes.
* Quotes and songs.
* The word &#34;Sausageboy.&#34;[[footnote]] (Strangely enough, there is no infohazard present when the word is separated into &#34;Sausage Boy.&#34;) [[/footnote]]

++++ Premise

//It Is Indeed the Sausageboy!// is set in Sausagia, a geographically impossible country that shares its borders with Switzerland, Poland, Saudi Arabia, and the Caspian Sea. Stories revolve around scatological humor, dadaism, and wildly incorrect mathematics and history lessons for younger viewers. 

All dialogue is in &#34;Sausagian,&#34; an original dialect of English that relies primarily on run-on sentences and bizarre (but technically correct) descriptions of the mundane.

Episodes last anywhere from six minutes to four hours. Every episode ends with a title card that displays the moral of the story for &#34;you kidlings who point your eyes at this.&#34; Said morals are nonsensical and often dangerous.

Some examples of the morals: 
* &#34;Eat nothing but oranges for two years.&#34; (SCP-7978-A-204)

++++ Recurring Characters

**__The Sausageboy__**

**Appearance:** Male. Grotesque and vaguely humanoid. He has a prehensile neck. Rarely turns away from directly gazing at the viewers. Speaks in a wheezing, falsetto male voice that displays signs of drunkenness. Only known clothing is an oversized purple T-shirt with the word &#34;POLAND&#34;. Age indeterminate; claims to be a toddler, but also insists that the freckles on his cheeks are actually age spots. Has a extremely large lower jaw which is usually hung open.

**Personality:** Giddy and energetic. Single-mindedly devoted to the acquisition and devourment of sausages. Has an obsessive fear of being alone in the dark; a recurring set piece is that he bites his way through solid brick walls to escape darkness.

**Other Notes:** The protagonist. Unquestionably adored and admired by all characters except the recurring villain (see last entry).

**__Mister Sausage That I Have__** 

**Appearance:** An indestructible kielbasa wielded by the main character. Its gender is situationally interchangeable and dictated by the Sausageboy.

**Personality:** None. Never speaks, but is implied to be sentient and extremely sensitive to pain. Only noises made are muffled screaming.

**Other Notes:** The Sausageboy has used this sausage for many non-sausage purposes, including (but not limited to) as a weapon, multitool, cotton swab, toothbrush, best friend, lockpick, execution device, eviction notice, blender, credit card, surgical implement, magnifying glass, nine-volt battery, notary public, shoehorn, sworn affidavit, trombone, microphone, stapler, therapist, wife, bartender, lawyer, surrogate mother, organ donor, and toilet brush. (It should be noted that Mister Sausage That I Have is not capable of shapeshifting.)

**__Father-Father-Father__**

**Appearance:** An overweight Bavarian man in lederhosen. 

**Personality:** Jolly but absentminded. His sole source of enjoyment is from being the recipient of extreme and unprovoked violence from his son, which he refers to as &#34;being foopted&#34;. Grows nervous, irritable, and paranoid if he goes without a foopting for an extended period.

**Other Notes:** The Sausageboy&#39;s sole parental figure. Makes a living as an alchemist. Created the Sausageboy as a homunculus through a lengthy ritual in his chamberpot.

**__Juoyjiy__**[[footnote]] (Pron. &#34;YOY-yee&#34;) [[/footnote]]

**Appearance:** Another bizarrely-shaped humanoid made by a rival alchemist. Blonde and has pigtails. Dressed in a tutu, a diaper, and a red sweater. Mouth is permanently puckered, even while talking.

**Personality:** Romantically obsessed with the Sausageboy. Speaks by repeating her name.

**Other Notes:** The only recurring female character. For unknown reasons, the Sausageboy is completely unaware of her existence on the physical level. A recurring gag is that he tramples her while walking.

**__The Horribebble Berdus__**

**Appearance:** Live-action footage of a male pigeon on a green screen. 

**Personality:** Does not speak. Is understandably terrified of the Sausageboy.

**Other Notes:** The antagonist. The Sausageboy blames him directly for every problem he encounters. The story arc of every episode is completed when the Sausageboy unsheathes a hidden blade from within Mister Sausage That I Have and stabs the Horribebble Berdus to death. This causes the pigeon to bleed giant piles of sausages from his wounds.

]]

SCP-7978-B denotes a sentient being who has been infected by SCP-7978. Currently, there are at least 20,000,000 uncontained human instances of SCP-7978-B. The four densest concentrations of SCP-7978-B exist in Poland, Belarus, the American Midwest, and Alberta.

While 57% of SCP-7978 infections are temporary, subjects who progress beyond Stage 4 are incapable of full recovery even with advanced amnestics. 

++++ Human SCP-7978-B Progression Breakdown:

||~ Stage ||~ Average Length ||~ Symptoms ||~ Treatment Options ||
|| Stage 1 || Initial exposure - 4 weeks || After initial disgust, subject becomes morbidly fascinated with SCP-7978, using descriptors similar to &#34;so bad it&#39;s good&#34; or &#34;this weird thing I saw on YouTube.&#34; || Reduced exposure to SCP-7978-A, amnestics, negative reaction from uninfected peers, the &#34;Caleb Grabowsky, Jr.&#34; strategy outlined earlier, 29-VEGETABILIS-PUER memetic inoculation. ||
|| Stage 2 || 4 weeks - 6 months || Subject expresses genuine appreciation for SCP-7978, often joining larger civilian fan communities.  Subject may also begin work on additional SCP-7978-A media. || Reduced exposure to SCP-7978-A, amnestics. ||
|| Stage 3 || 6 months - 2 Years || Having gained deeper devotion to SCP-7978, subject becomes a major artistic contributor to SCP-7978-A. In addition, subject is openly hostile to other intellectual properties and non-Sausageboy media, often claiming that other stories &#34;ripped off&#34; concepts from SCP-7978-A. || Two months of heavy amnestic treatment while in a drug-induced coma. ||
|| Stage 4 || 2 years + || Subject speaks exclusively in the &#34;Sausagian&#34; dialect. They begin to view SCP-7978 as a messianic figure and treat the morals at the end of every episode as commands from a divine prophet. Subject reforms every aspect of their life around SCP-7978. Some commit acts of violence and terrorism against uninfected civilians, especially creators and distributors of non-Sausageboy content. Most, however, opt to shun the outside world and join fortified civilian compounds known as &#34;Sausclaves.&#34; Here, SCP-7978-B are free to follow SCP-7978&#39;s &#34;teachings&#34; -- that is, the morals written at the end of every episode. Due to the content of said morals, this invariably results in psychological trauma, autocannibalism, ritualistic brain damage, malnutrition, ketosis, sepsis, blood loss, urinary tract infections, gangrene, tetanus, hangnails, and death. As per the moral of SCP-7978-A-83, Stage 4 subjects do not believe in death, and deceased subjects are often ostracized for laziness. || N/A - Subject is to be terminated or considered lost. ||

SCP-7978-C is former Foundation researcher Josephine Baldwin, a 28-year-old female human of Quebecois descent. She is currently the only person capable of forcing SCP-7978-Prime to enter a brief period of dormancy. (See Addendum 2.)

SCP-7978-Prime is the central memetic consciousness of SCP-7978, currently contained in SCP-7978-C&#39;s laptop. SCP-7978-Prime exhibits a gradually increasing level of control of the computer to an anomalous extent. As of 4/29/2023, the computer no longer needs a power source or the laptop&#39;s battery to activate when under SCP-7978-Prime&#39;s influence. 

The laptop was accidentally destroyed during an attempted containment breach on 10/14/2021, but it was found intact in its inner vault the next day. Research into this regenerative ability is ongoing. 

So long as SCP-7978-Prime remains in the computer, the spread of SCP-7978 is mitigated by an average of 42%. (However, it should be noted that last year, the rate was 56%.)

------

+++ Addendum 1: Discovery

For two years after the initial video was distributed, the Foundation believed that SCP-7978 was a non-anomalous cultural phenomenon. Its anomalous attributes did not come to light until 2/23/2019, when the following internal memo was sent in the Indiana University biology department:

&gt; From: xpendleton@indiana.edu
&gt; To: dgutierrez1@indiana.edu
&gt; Subject: &#34;Rat Cult&#34; Incident
&gt; 
&gt; Darlene, I&#39;m not sure who else to go to about this. You probably won&#39;t believe what I&#39;m about to tell you, but I have video evidence, and I can replicate my results in good faith. But even in that case, I&#39;m at an impasse as to what exactly to do about what I&#39;ve seen -- perhaps you&#39;ll have some ideas?
&gt; 
&gt; Jackie, one of my research interns, was taking some of our rats through typical maze exercises last Valentine&#39;s Day. Meanwhile, in the same room, another intern named Nick was watching some videos on YouTube. Something about the &#34;Sausage Boy.&#34; Apparently it&#39;s some kind of internet meme. But he&#39;s been playing these videos all day, even during working hours -- and it&#39;s not like it&#39;s just one student. It feels like half my Zoology 101 class is talking about Sausage Boy whenever I catch them in the halls.
&gt; 
&gt; But Jackie saw something weird in the rats. She called me over from my own lunch break. I wasn&#39;t thrilled, of course, but she said it was like the rats were &#34;possessed.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; And the minute I make it to the lab, the rats were arranging their feces into the shape of the Sausage Boy&#39;s head. I was about to tear both Nick and Jackie a new one because I thought this was some kind of prank. But Jackie showed me the video footage, and I was floored. The rats were doing this on their own, working together in ways that I had never seen before. What&#39;s more, they stopped their little poop-sculptures whenever Nick paused the video. 
&gt; 
&gt; This defies explanation. Even if one of my interns secretly moonlights as a rat trainer, these specimens were shipped in on the same day this happened.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;ve been trying to replicate what I&#39;ve seen with different groups of rats by exposing them to sausage boy cartoons. And each time, it&#39;s something new and more shocking.
&gt; 
&gt; Specimen G938 severed his own tail and went around holding it the way the sausage boy holds his sausage. (Self-mutilation was common - it&#39;s like these cartoons are suppressing their survival instincts.)  F922 through F931 smeared their scalps with their own blood in a way that looked like the sausage boy&#39;s bowl cut. E028 had a seizure every time I hit the pause button.
&gt; 
&gt; I have prayed for the first time in nine years. Other than that, I have no idea what the hell I&#39;m supposed to do. The scientist in me tells me to look into this further. But the realist in me tells me the public would call BS and this will all end in animal cruelty charges and losing my tenure.
&gt; 
&gt; Please advise.
&gt; 
&gt; -- //Dr. Xavier Pendleton, IU Biology Department//
&gt; 

Following this, Dr. Darlene Gutierrez, Dr. Pendleton&#39;s supervisor, contacted the Foundation to report possible anomalous activity.

------

+++ Addendum 2: Project Farcimen and SCP-7978-C

Two months after SCP-7978&#39;s anomalous capabilities came to light, Project Farcimen began at Site-59 as a means to capture and isolate the hypothetical memetic nucleus of SCP-7978, dubbed SCP-7978-Prime. There was little evidence for SCP-7978-Prime&#39;s existence at the time the project began, but the fact that SCP-7978-B were treating the Sausageboy as a god lent itself to the hypothesis that a single entity was controlling SCP-7978 for malicious purposes.

Project Farcimen consisted of exposing a non-anomalous closed-system PC to a constant stream of SCP-7978-A for one year. This PC was kept running continuously, with only one program open at all times: MrJabber, a prototype AI chatbot, to serve as the potential host for SCP-7978-Prime.

If successful, that PC would be used to contain and isolate SCP-7978-Prime, thus reducing or stopping the spread of SCP-7978 globally.

Project Farcimen was led by researcher Josephine Baldwin, who previously worked with electronics-based anomalies at Site-101.

I&#39;ve seen what happens in the Sausclaves. Perhaps you are unaware, so I&#39;ll enlighten you.

I had to watch a seven-year-old child have a dozen squirrel carcasses surgically removed from his stomach because episode 95 said it would help him pass a spelling test.

The Crested Augustine Hen in Tasmania went extinct because one episode said they were working for the Horribebble Berdus. For the first time in history, the words &#34;Bird Genocide&#34; made the front page of the Washington Post.

One of your top fans in Iowa diverted a slaughterhouse lagoon into a water reservoir for the town of Clinton because you said it would turn their drinking water into &#34;sausage-adjacency water&#34; that would give them superpowers.

Look, we don&#39;t want to kill you or punish you. I&#39;m not saying you won&#39;t exist. 

In fact, by way of your containment file, there will be always someone to know that you exist.

Following the last message of Test 2, Baldwin screamed and complained of severe, stabbing abdominal pain. Post-incident medical analysis found no sign of injury.

At the same time, SCP-7978-Prime began a two-week period of inactivity. This is currently hypothesized to be because SCP-7978-Prime now sees Baldwin as &#34;The Horribebble Berdus&#34;, and inflicting some form of harm on Baldwin &#34;ended the episode.&#34;

In the following days, Baldwin developed extremely bizarre behavioral patterns consistent with a stage 4 SCP-7978-B, but with devotion for SCP-7978-Prime replaced by obsessive hatred. Other new habits included eating food off the floor, head-jerking movements while walking, squatting on top of high surfaces, and public defecation. Baldwin has since been reclassified as SCP-7978-C.
