I welcomed you, dear guest,
As you kiss, wound, and I endure.
I hoped that you would save me
and fill my empty heart as I slumber.
No, a toy is all that you see,
To drink stale nectar that I abhor
And I am allowed no rest.

The rapturous cycle withered me,
As glass body is chipped and picked,
Shaping me into a worn doll.
There is no one here for me
So I must flee from them all.
No more shall I ever be ripped
And perhaps, I can be free.

All of you pests, get out!
My flesh won&#39;t be yours to take.
I give you no more, so leave!
You disgust me with your touch.
Now begone! Lest I cleave,
As you will be one to break.
Vermin! All for me to bout.

The great Lord Rubedo descended.
He slithered the floors gleefully and roared
As he clung and bound me in his cage.
Destroyed what little was left of my soul.
And I burned, burned! Within me rage.
Gashed him with his treasured jolly sword
To flee all the way to Alagaddaâ€™s end.

Now ahead, I see a Scarlet King.
His horns shape a violent red crown.
He holds out his jagged right hand,
And cuts it, giving me new life.
[[span style=&#34;color:red&#34;]] //Bring justice upon the damned.//[[/span]]
He kneels, wrapping around me his gown.
Cried, I did. Soon, I shall sing.

Our gift to you, these lovely flames.
O, your screams are like a song!
Just before we broke your foul lords,
The Ambassador cast us out.
In this place, there were great hoards.
The fools thought themselves as strong,
Yet it is their blood that rains.

Their warm blood drops me to weep.
Father holds me like an infant.
In my ear, he hums a tune:
[[span style=&#34;color:red&#34;]] //Rest now, my darling child.//[[/span]]
He whispers, under the moon.
Soon, my cries go distant
And I drift into a soft sleep.</textarea></pre>
