[STORY]
{Weather Report}
We know that you, our dear readers, aren’t used to having a weather report right at the start seeing that our agency publishes new issues once a year. However, this weather report contains some intriguing information on why exactly a single, large and very threatening cloud covered our city last week and when it will go.

Our meteorologists have predicted a sudden change in the weather, but do not get your hopes up, our dear folks for the cloudy weather won’t go away anytime soon. Tomorrow, on Monday 4th, it will rain. Then, the day after that the rain will continue raining. It will also rain on Wednesday, Thursday as well as Friday. Saturday will experience some unexpected flood, so be aware that your floor and ceiling might get damp and soggy. Get your buckets ready or even better - an ark.
And now onto why we are being punished by god. It seems that the cloud has originated from the main part of London and decided to hang around our district for a few months. We do not know if it has sentience. We do now know why it chose us. We do know, however, that it came from a closed factory, somewhere in the northern district of London. The Scotland Yard is currently investigating the factory and reported to have spotted a “wild man” running around the old building and shouting something about the Great Flood and an ark. Nobody is sure of the identity of the man, the Church says that it’s Noah, but we all know he died. Right?

For all of the curious minds among our readers, the cloud mostly consists of water, but our scientists have recently spotted some bits of misery and depression in its mists, hence the dark texture. The Research Centre is currently pondering on whether these bits of misery came from us or from the main part of London. Well, I can surely say that the main part of London is much more depressed than us. I can’t blame them, I would be too if I had to eat beans and drink tea for my whole life. Poor creatures, those Londoners.

[STORY]
{Vase}
A glass vase stood on top of a small table nested inside a dark corner of a hallway. It was given to a newlyweds couple at their wedding by some distant relative of the husband. The wife thanked the man and smiled and then immediately forgot about the vase until the very next day after the wedding. The vase was not very beautiful, but whenever it was put in any other room it always stood out and attracted unnecessary attention, so the wife put it on the small table nested inside the dark corner of the hallway. And inside she put a single rose, an odd number which many considered a bad omen. Still the couple lived happily.

A few months pass, the life of the couple stays the same: the husband and wife go to work, eat in the evenings, have walks in the park on weekends. The rose in the vase, though still beautiful, started to fade. Its petals are not as bright as on the very day after the wedding, but guests who often visited the couple and dared to wander into the very dark and creepy corner of the house almost always said, &#34;Oh, wow, that&#39;s a pretty rose you&#39;ve got there.&#34;

Another few months pass, the life of the couple stays the same: the husband and wife go to work, sometimes eat in the evenings together and rarely have an argument or two. Still, they always make up after and are never angry at each other for too long. The rose inside the vase now doesn&#39;t hold the same beauty as before, most of its petals are on the floor after which they end up in the waste bin, its once green stem was now the colour of a swamp, the water inside the vase was no longer there. Guests who sometimes visited the couple and dared to wander into the very dark and creepy corner of the house almost always said, &#34;Oh, you should probably water the rose. Should I do it for you?&#34;

Another few months pass, the life of the couple stays the same: the husband goes to work, they rarely have dinners together, but sometimes watch TV before going to bed. They often have arguments even over mundane things, but they&#39;ve never been cross with each other for longer than a week. When they are cross with each other, the husband often sleeps on the couch, but they often make up after that. The rose is now slowly withering away, only a few petals left and the only thing that stayed the same, apart from the couple&#39;s life, is the vase. Guests, who visited the couple on holidays and dared to wander into the very dark and creepy corner of the house almost always said nothing.

Another few months pass, the life of the couple stays the same: the husband almost always comes home late, the couple only has dinners together when guests are visiting, the wife sleeps alone and almost every day they shout about something, even over mundane things. The rose is now only a black stem, nothing is left of its beauty, only the vase stays the same. Only the vase stays the same.

A few more weeks pass, the life of the couple stays the same: the ex-husband visits his new acquaintance, the ex-wife stays with her parents. The rose is now gone, only the vase was forgotten in the old house, sitting on top of the small table nested inside the dark corner of the hallway. Only the vase stays the same and nothing else. And nothing else.

&lt;i&gt;“Sure, it looks nice and has lots of pretty features. But is it useful? Is your brain useful if it can’t use any of the information you hold? The answer is: no. The answer is: you’re useless.”&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;“I like reading. The problem is, I don’t like reading your works. Because they remind me of you and the days we once were together. Now, whenever I see your books in bookstores, I remember you. And it hurts me.”&lt;/i&gt;

[STORY]
{The Crooked man}
Atop a hill lived a man. His house was not the best kind, all of its walls sunk to the ground, pointing upwards and then slowly bending and twisting in patterns no human brain can perceive. Its windows were no better, starting with regular glass, but soon changing to one which twists and bends anything that passes through it. Nobody ever dared to come close to the house, for any fool knew what man lived inside of such a house. The crooked man.
It was Friday evening, everybody coming home from a busy day at work. You too were walking on the busy streets of our district, past the hill with nothing but the crooked house. You always took this route, it was the shortest one - a straight line from point A to point B. Trying not to look in the direction of the house you slipped and fell. Not a very pleasant experience, considering the fact that everybody saw it. Including Him.
“Do not think about it,” you said to yourself and continued to do so until you arrived home. Exhausted. Food, bed, sleep. That’s everything you remembered from that evening.

The very next morning you did not have to go to work, but you did nevertheless. Loans on that flat have been daunting you for ages now and some extra cash won’t hurt. That crooked house again. God, you hated it so much. Who even built it? Who invited such an abomination in our nice, little district? Sure, you’ve seen many disturbing things here, this place literally attracts anomalies. But this? This was something different, something that instilled primal fear into you and everybody.
That same day when the sun was slowly setting you walked back home. Past the crooked house with the crooked man inside. You knew he was staring at you. Watching. Observing your every move. Your every action.
“Don’t think,” you repeated. “Don’t think.”
Yet you did think, yet you did notice his eyes with their twisted pupils staring through the window. Yes, he was enjoying your panic. He was enjoying your stress.
“What a delight,” he thought. Or was it your thought? Why would you even think that?

Sunday. It’s here and even you did not go to work. You simply enjoyed a nice walk around the city and that… crooked house. How did you arrive here again? What force was driving you? Getting you near this… This house. This alluring place? No! It was time to go home. You had lots of work to do, yes. Like painting your windows. And curling your hair. And maybe even stop ironing your clothes. Why bother? Those twists and turns on your shirts looked very nice. That evening you went back home and did not think about the crooked house or the crooked man. Why bother? On the second glance that house did not look that bad after all. You even started liking it.

The very next morning you went to work, past the crooked house. Now, the feeling of dread was gone and you enjoyed passing this strange and unique house every day. One day, you decided to visit the Crooked man. You rang the doorbell, nervous, but still happy. You could not explain your joy in visiting the previously thought creepy man. Some passers-by gave you warning looks, others even judged you, but you did not care. What do they know? What do they know of the prettiness of this house? Of its strange and alluring architecture? Nothing, that’s it!

The door slowly opened. You saw the inside of the house and almost screamed. Too late, the Crooked man already took you in and shut the door. Too late.

[STORY]
{Apple tree}
An apple tree stood on top of a hill, blooming every spring, decaying every autumn. And every year, the blooming apple tree was visited by a couple, a woman and a man. The first time the tree met them was when they were still little children. They carried the tree on top of the hill and planted it with another figure, an old man with whom little children played that summer.

The next spring, the apple tree saw them again. They were still kids but the girl was taller and looked more mature than the boy. And the figure who helped plant the tree followed with them too. And the kids touched and looked at the tree and how tall it grew over the year. They played until evening and then the man told them it&#39;s time to go.

The next spring, the apple tree met the two kids again, though this time they were both teenagers. They simply looked at the tree and then asked the man if they could go now. The man told them to touch the apple tree and they complied, not without irritation. Afterwards, the three left the hill for another year.

The next spring, the apple tree saw the couple again. The girl and the boy, both young and flourishing, very much like the tree. This time the figure was slow and tired, it took the man a long time to go up the hill. The three simply stood there and watched the leaves rustle in the wind. The tree was now taller than anybody of the three, even taller than the man.

The next spring, the apple tree saw the couple again. The woman and the man, but without the third figure. Both looked sorrowful and they did not drop a single word. They touched the bark of the tree and the woman cried and the man did too. They sat there until evening and then went on their way.

The next spring, the apple tree did not see the couple. Neither did it see them the next spring and the spring after that. A few years passed before the apple tree, now tall and thick and with real apples, saw them. They both looked old, the flourishing times of the youth have long since passed. They walked around the tree, sat under it and talked until the evening arrived, but even then they talked and talked and talked.

A few years passed again, the apple tree now too was old. The couple were now older, they walked slowly and looked tired just like the third figure did on his last spring and the apple tree worried. The couple walked around the tree and sat under it. This time they simply looked over the valley and the distant village below it. And when the night came they still sat and remembered the old days, the days of childhood, the days when they were still in love with the world.

The next spring, the apple tree saw the woman again, this time without the man and it worried. The old woman&#39;s hair was grey and pale. She touched the tree&#39;s bark and cried. And this time she cried and cried and cried until the sun went down, until the moon went up, until every star died out, until the whole world ended and then appeared again, until darkness consumed everything and light was born over and over and over again. And she cried until the apple tree cried with her too and even then she cried. And even then she cried.

[INTER]&lt;h2&gt;Public Service Announcement&lt;/h2&gt;
We have grave news to share with you, our dear readers. What we feared most has arrived. The Circus. We ask you to stay calm and not to fall into violent and sudden outbursts of scream and panic. The Circus will not stay for very long, fortunately, but we remind you to stay safe. We have gathered a list of instructions on how to avoid the effects of the Circus and what to do if you see the Troupe Master.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay at home as much as possible (leave only when completely necessary)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid any clowns that you see (even if they look friendly and have funny noses they will attack. You don’t want to die of laughter, it’s extremely painful)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay out of sight of the magician (he will perform a magic trick if he sees you. You will not survive)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close your ears if you hear music&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
If you’ve accidentally encountered the Troupe Master, here are a few tips to increase your chances of survival:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look directly in its eyes (the Troupe Master will not attack if it considers you too dangerous. Even demons have their own doubts)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not laugh at any jokes (it will show your weakness and nearby clowns may attack)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do NOT applaud (no explanation necessary)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Follow this advice and you (might) survive this fair. Remember, if you spot a person being attacked by the Circus creatures — do not interfere. Call an ambulance and find a safe place.
