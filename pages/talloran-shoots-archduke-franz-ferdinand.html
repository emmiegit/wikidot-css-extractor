In the depth of the night, Talloran crouched to the floor gayly, his hands around his Cobra Enterprise Inc CA380 380 ACP Carry Conceal Pistol with Pink Grips from sportsmansoutdoorsuperstore.com with an attached Sniper ZT 5-25x50 FFP First Focal Plane (FFP) Scope with Red/Green Illuminated Reticle and Gangster Spongebob custom decal.

In his sights, the greatest Evil-Doer of all history, a man guilty of Warmongering, skilled in Leadership, all while having a stare that could weaken even superheroes and a hobby of Spreading Hate... Adolf Hitler (Captain Planet) himself.

&gt; please stop commenting that i didnt write adolf as true to his character! i used trustworthy sources and i know that they are right! look i even have my sources cited:
&gt; 
&gt; “Adolf Hitler (Captain Planet).” Villains Wiki, [https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Adolf_Hitler_(Captain_Planet) villains.fandom.com/wiki/Adolf_Hitler_(Captain_Planet)].
&gt; 
&gt; this also means you can&#39;t ban me for plagiarism because you hate me so much! nah nah nah boo boo!

With just one shot, Talloran could finally end adolfus&#39;s evil tyranny... his trigger finger tensed up as it began pressing down.

//bang.//

Talloran watched as the bullet exited the barrel of the Cobra Enterprise Inc CA380 380 ACP Carry Conceal Pistol with Pink Grips from sportsmansoutdoorsuperstore.com with an attached Sniper ZT 5-25x50 FFP First Focal Plane (FFP) Scope with Red/Green Illuminated Reticle and Gangster Spongebob custom decal in what felt like slow motion. But his world, his gay little world, his epic little reality... it crumbled before him. And he realized... that wasn&#39;t Adolf Hitler (Captain Planet)... that was Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria (Turtledove Book Series)! All he could do was watch as the bullet flew into the Archduke, leaving him dead as a dead guy.

&gt; will u guyz shut up already! I KNOW I AM WRITING FRANZY RIGHT!!! STOP TRYING TO SAY I AM NOT!!! i USE MY RESOURCES and RESEARCH on BING DOT COM unlike SOME OF YOU!!!!!!!! again i have left my sources below. &gt;:(
&gt; 
&gt; “Franz Ferdinand of Austria.” Turtledove, [https://turtledove.fandom.com/wiki/Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria turtledove.fandom.com/wiki/Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria].

But that wasn&#39;t even the worst part. That&#39;s right, something even worse than the start of World War I happened.

The worst thing that happened, the event that made Talloran feel like throwing a tantrum... it was that his true love, his Cobra Enterprise Inc CA380 380 ACP Carry Conceal Pistol with Pink Grips from sportsmansoutdoorsuperstore.com with an attached Sniper ZT 5-25x50 FFP First Focal Plane (FFP) Scope with Red/Green Illuminated Reticle and Gangster Spongebob custom decal faded away.

Three nine nine nine slowly rose behind Talloran&#39;s back. And it spoke:

&#34;your jordans are fake as FUCK&#34;
