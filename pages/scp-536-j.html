**Item #:** SCP-536-J

**Object Class:** The hell is that thing?

**Special Containment Procedures:**  Hold very, very still.  Seriously, dude, don&#39;t move a fucking muscle.  I&#39;m pretty sure it can smell fear.

**Description:** SCP-536-J was discovered on the back of your head.  Yeah, it&#39;s still there.  Hold still, man.

Okay, you know those lobsters?  The ones without claws?  It&#39;s kind of like that, but more legs.  Like, a lot more.  And I think I was wrong about the claws.  Jesus fucking Christ.

Its anomalous properties include rapid growth of... are those tentacles?  What the hell kind of [[[SCP-006-J|bug]]] has tentacles? What is it… Oh Jesus. That&#39;s not right.  

Its fangs are dripping with an unknown viscous green substance.  No fucking clue what it is, but I wouldn&#39;t want to get any on me.

The diet of SCP-536-J is still largely a mystery, but I think it&#39;s trying to eat your hat.  Either that or make a nest.  I&#39;m not sure which.

It&#39;s currently unknown how SCP-536-J reproduces, but it seems to be making a spirited attempt in your hair.  Are those eggs, or what?  Eww.  You&#39;re probably going to want to shave your head when this is done.

Plans to remove SCP-536-J have been proposed, but so far all have been rejected on the basis that it&#39;s gonna sting the living shit out of you if we scare it.  We have to do this carefully, man.

**Addendum-536-J-01:** //SCP-536-J&#39;s nature remains largely unknown, but a cursory examination of your back shows that there are at least two of them.  Fuck, I think it&#39;s going down your pants.//
