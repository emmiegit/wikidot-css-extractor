**Item #:** SCP-729-J

**Object Class:** --Keter-- Thaumiel (Guys, you&#39;re hurting his feelings! He&#39;s just trying to help!) (Can we maybe make a new object class for this thing? Maybe Apollyon+?)

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-729-J currently resides in Dr. Niles Hessen&#39;s office on her desk. Where, pray to god, it will stay. Request testing at your own risk. It breaches containment at an alarming frequency, but even MTF Nu-7 (&#34;Hammer Down&#34;) refuses to go near the fucking thing, so it does whatever the hell it wants. We are all at its mercy. Dr. Hessen has been commanded to turn in SCP-729-J for it to be properly contained...as soon as someone can get up the courage to write her an email. 

**Description:** SCP-729-J is SUPPOSED to be a toy, but I want to know who the sick fuck was that wanted to give this thing to children. The label SAYS it&#39;s made of polyester fiber, but we all know it&#39;s made of the devil&#39;s couch stuffing. Or something.

Its reign of terror began during a containment breach of [[[SCP-106]]]. SCP-106 had managed to trap Dr. Hessen in her office and had successfully corroded a hole in the door when it caught sight of --that goddamn thing-- SCP-729-J. SCP-106 stopped moving completely and began staring at SCP-729-J, showing no interest in Dr. Hessen. SCP-106 then began moving backwards out of Dr. Hessen&#39;s office, never breaking visual contact with --that eldritch horror-- SCP-729-J, until it reached the end of the hall and promptly rematerialized back in its containment cell. It should be noted that SCP-106&#39;s middle fingers were raised for the entirety of the encounter with SCP-729-J. SCP-106&#39;s reaction is, frankly, perfectly understandable, and several researchers who witnessed the event were found huddling with SCP-106 in its containment cell. 

**TESTING LOGS:**

&gt; [[[SCP-2006]]]
&gt; 
&gt; **Effects:** SCP-2006 screeched upon being introduced, and assumed a form identical to SCP-729-J. SCP-2006 has not changed form since the encounter. 

&gt; [[[SCP-1322]]]
&gt; 
&gt; **Effects:** SCP-729-J was sent through the wormhole to the SCP-1322 society. It was returned 6 minutes later, tied to a white flag. 

&gt; [[[SCP-303]]]
&gt; 
&gt; **Effects:** When Dr. Hessen was told to walk through a door with 303 on the other side while holding SCP-729-J, SCP-303 promptly opened the door for Dr. Hessen and ushered her through before quickly exiting the room, with Dr. Hessen showing no sign of the usual fear response. SCP-303 was found six hours later in an abandoned storage closet in a fetal position, sucking its thumb.

&gt; [[[SCP-3000]]]
&gt; 
&gt; **Effects:** SCP-729-J was put on a fishing hook and lowered into the sea, to where the current position of SCP-3000 was found with radar. After 2 hours of lowering it into the sea, Dr. Saarland complained about a cramp in his hand from unwinding the fishing pole and Dr. Bayer took over. Another 50 minutes later the assumed depth of SCP-3000 was reached. After 2 minutes, a tug was felt on the fishing pole and SCP-3000&#39;s presence swiftly disappeared from the radar. As Dr. Bayer also complained of his hand hurting, retrieval of the end of the fishing line was postponed. 
&gt; 
&gt; //I told them both they should do stretches beforehand, but no, &#34;We play Halo every Friday!&#34;, &#34;Our wrists are trained!&#34;. Should have listened. - Dr. Baden//
&gt; 
&gt; The next day, //after proper warmup//, SCP-729-J was successfully retrieved, along with a crudely written note attached to it, reading: //Alright, I thought we had a deal. I turn some consciousnesses to spaghetti, and you guys get your regrety-forgety. But, okay, you won. You get the forgety stuff for free. Lifetime supply. But please, just this one condition! Keep. That thing. Out. Of. My. Ocean! I&#39;ll go for a while. I need to calm down.//

&gt; [[[SCP-055]]]
&gt;
&gt; **Effects:** Dr. Hessen walked into the containment chamber of SCP-055 holding SCP-729-J. About 5 minutes later, the containment chamber opened and a calico cat ran into Dr. Hessen&#39;s office.
&gt;
&gt; //Oh, Pudding, come here! I brought a new friend for you! -Dr. Hessen//
&gt;
&gt; //Wait, we even had a 055? And it&#39;s a cat named Pudding? -Dr. Aksum//


&gt; [[[SCP-650]]]
&gt;
&gt; **Effects:** Dr. Hessen was told to directly observe SCP-650 in its containment cell whilst holding SCP-729-J. Before Dr. Hessen could be asked to break her line of sight with SCP-650, the lighting within SCP-650&#39;s containment cell briefly deactivated and the sound of quick, heavy footsteps could be heard from its room, according to Dr. Hessen. When the power to SCP-650&#39;s chamber was restored, SCP-650 had completely vanished from its containment site and was nowhere to be found near Dr. Hessen; however, onsite staff noted that a sign of the cross had been crudely carved into one of the walls within SCP-650&#39;s containment cell. A containment breach alert was sounded; after two hours of extensive searching, SCP-650 was discovered hiding within a storage closet, apparently having attempted to bury its head into the floor. SCP-650 was eventually returned to its containment cell, but has since constantly faced the wall with the engraved cross and has not moved from its position.

&gt; [[[SCP-1048]]]
&gt; 
&gt; **Effects:** When exposed to SCP-729-J, all copies made by SCP-1048 became immobile and have not regained mobility since exposure. SCP-1048 appeared alarmed by this, making a gesture like the sign of the cross, and retreated behind its copies. SCP-1048 regained the ability to make copies of itself when SCP-729-J was removed. It now frequently produces art that depict SCP-729-J as monstrous in some form, and cowers if shown a picture of SCP-729-J.

//Not even the teddy? Aww... Poor Mr. Buns. He just wants some friends! - Dr. Hessen//

//Try [[[SCP-2317 | 2317]]]. Maybe then that hellbeast can be with its own kind. -Dr. Yvaine//

//It wouldn&#39;t play with him either! - Dr. Hessen//

//... My god. - Dr. Yvaine//

&gt; [[[SCP-682]]]
&gt;
&gt; **Effects:** [DATA EXPUNGED]

//Long story short, we reclassed SCP-682 as Neutralized. You don&#39;t even want to fucking know how this little fucker killed it. - Dr. Foxfield//

&gt; [[[SCP-076]]]
&gt;
&gt; **Effects:** SCP-729-J was placed inside SCP-076’s containment area when scans showed that SCP-076-2’s heart was beginning to beat. All humans exited the room, and researchers watched behind a camera. When SCP-076-2 got out of SCP-076-1, instead of looking for the nearest human, he looked straight at 729-J. SCP-076-2 materialized an American M9-Flamethrower and the corresponding fuel pack. He attempted to use it on SCP-729-J, but the flamethrower did nothing to it. When SCP-076-2 ran out of fuel and saw that 729-J was unharmed, he ran back into SCP-076-1 and curled up into a ball. Crying sounds were coming from the inside of SCP-076-1. It has been 2 weeks, and SCP-076-2 has yet to come out of that position.

&gt; [[[SCP-073]]] 
&gt; **Effects:** When exposed to SCP-729-J, SCP-073 took a cup of water, and proceeded to bless it. SCP-073 then vocalized the phrase: “FUCK OFF, DICKNIPS!” and soaked the little shit in the holy water.
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-073 remained under a table for the remainder of the test, with its fingers in the form of a cross.

&gt; [[[SCP-187]]]
&gt; **Effects:** Upon being exposed to SCP-729-J, SCP-187 began to vomit and froth at the mouth. SCP-187 displays rapid emotional changes, switching from screaming and babbling to squealing and cooing. SCP-187 is immediately removed.
&gt; 
&gt; Upon being interviewed, SCP-187 said &#34;How can such a thing be so ungodly yet so cute?!&#34; SCP-187 is currently undergoing therapy.

&gt; [[[SCP-1915]]]
&gt; **Effects:** SCP-729-J is exposed to SCP-1915. Upon exposure, SCP-1915 exclaimed while raising his arms high into the air &#34;I QUIT!&#34; 
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-1915 breaches containment and [DATA EXPUNGED]
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-1915 is currently believed to be conversing with SCP-3812 about the futility of Narratives and plot points, currently debating which of their creators have the smallest dick.

&gt; [[[SCP-4812]]]-K
&gt; **Effects:** SCP-729-J is launched straight at SCP-4812-K.
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-4812-K begins to scream and writhe around, before charging towards SCP-225-1, killing itself.
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-4812-S and -E are reported at this time to breach containment, both self terminating. SCP-729-J is retrieved and given back hastily by the GOC, stating it killed the Eros entity by landing on it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** Upon being asked how he is still capable of talking and reacting in a calm and stoic manner around that goddamn thing, Dr. Gears spoke calmly, stating &#34;I have actually soiled my pants the first time I looked at it, and Now I have a super toilet in the observation deck, with a throw up bucket and shower included. I honestly am as disgusted by it as you are.&#34;

&gt; [[[SCP-173]]]
&gt; **Effects:** [DATA EXPUNGED]
//Don&#39;t ask about it. No, the war head did not destroy either of them. No, there was no grand battle. Yes, there was a discussion. No, do not go and try searching for the Koitern or the [DATA LOST]. No, not even the Wanderer&#39;s Library. Yes, they did don sombreros. No, we have yet to remove them. NO; We will not try this again, less we see an AZ-Class &#34;Fiesta&#34; scenario. Yes, that is all we found in the second SCP-5000 suit that showed up in SCP-173s containment chamber.  -Green//

//“I don’t know. I think he looks cute with it!” -Dr.Hessen//

&gt; [[[SCP-001]]]
&gt; **Effects:** Tom Brady, Quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, was abducted and forced to throw SCP-729-J into SCP-001’s radius. SCP-001 immediately looked at 729-J and bowed. A mouth shaped opening appeared on SCP-001’s head, and in a loud voice, it said “My lord.” SCP-001 then picked up 729-J and put it in the garden on the other side of the gate that SCP-001 guarded. 729-J was only able to be retrieved when SCP-001 was allowed to have [[[SCP-999]]] for a day.
//Don’t worry, Tom Brady was given, as SCP-3000 so gracefully put it, ‘regrety-forgety’. - Dr. [REDACTED], head of the Amnestics department//

&gt; [[[SCP-049]]]
&gt; **Effects:** When exposed to SCP-729-J, SCP-049 appeared to stagger, grasping its head with its hand and falling to its knees, stating &#34;The Pestilence... it&#39;s... too strong...&#34; SCP-049 then attempted to crawl towards SCP-729-J, vocalizing &#34;I must... cure you...&#34; but fell to the ground and fell unconscious.
//&#34;Damn, guess that dude&#39;s too strong a plague even for 049&#34; -Dr. Brine//

&gt; [[[SCP-294]]]
&gt; **Effects:** D-382563 was asked to type ‘SCP729J’ on SCP-294’s keyboard. He initially refused, stating that he had heard stories of 729-J from the other Class-D’s, and that he “wanted nothing to do with that creature of Satan”. D-382563 was held at gunpoint by a security officer until he obliged to type it. 294 produced a titanium cup, with the words ‘This is the only thing that can hold a liquid of this toxicity’ imprinted on the outside of it. The cup was then filled with a neon yellow liquid. D-382563 was, again, held at gunpoint, until he drank the liquid. After D-382563 drank it, his eyes turned red, and then promptly [DATA EXPUNGED]. His whole body then turned inside out. Flaming skeleton hands emerged from the ground and dragged him down into the floor. When D-382563 was gone, a note appeared where he was dragged into the ground. The note read ‘That little shitstain of a toy did not come from here, and I beg you to keep it FAR away from here. -Satan’.
//“G-G-Get me the FUCK out of here!” -Dr. Roshland, an hour before resigning.//

&gt; [[[SCP-914]]] 
&gt; **Effects:** SCP-729-J was placed in the intake booth of SCP-914 by Dr. Hessen. SCP-914 was set to &#34;Rough&#34; by Dr. ███████ in order to, &#34;Finally terminate this god forsaken abomination&#34;. When attempting to turn the key, SCP-914 refused to operate while SCP-729-J was in the intake. Investigation of SCP-914 shows that a note was found in the output booth. The note read, &#34;This is one thing that can not be refined. I don&#39;t care how many times you try, get that shit out of here.&#34;

&gt; [[[SCP-231]]]
&gt; **Effects:** [DATA EXPUNGED]
//Procedure 110-Montauk has now been replaced with periodic exposure to SCP-729-J, given the much higher levels of emotional distress produced by the latter.//

&gt; //On ██/██/2022, the Ethics Committee made contact with Dr. Wondertainment as well as Marshall, Carter, and Dark for possible leads on the source of --this fucking thing-- SCP-729-J.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Response from DW:** Look, we make //toys//. Sometimes lethal, yes, but we don&#39;t go raiding Mr. Scarlett&#39;s playpen. And before you ask, no, it&#39;s not AWCY either. We forwarded some of their higher-ups that pic you sent us, and I&#39;m pretty sure I could hear the screaming from my office.
&gt; 
&gt; **Response from MC&amp;D:** Our organization&#39;s purpose is to produce a profit. How in the blue fuck do you think we could expect to sell this hellspawn to anyone? On an unrelated note, if you wouldn&#39;t mind forwarding Dr. Hessen&#39;s contact info, we have a few XK-Class items sitting around that no one&#39;s been willing to purchase yet.


**Interview Log:**

&gt; **Interviewed:** Dr. Hessen
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Yvaine
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** SCP-729-J was &#34;contained,&#34; if you can call it that, in Dr. Hessen&#39;s purse, despite multiple pleas to please just put the goddamn thing away.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Yvaine:** Dr. Hessen. Tell us the means by which you obtained SCP-729-J.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Hessen:** I mean, it was a little gift I ordered for myself online. Easter, you know?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Yvaine:** Nothing odd at all about its manufacturing?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Hessen:** Nope!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Yvaine:** And yet we&#39;ve scoured the factory where it was made for evidence of satanic rituals. Odd.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Hessen:** But yeah, he... came in the mail! It was one of the special scented ones. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Yvaine:** Dear god... [Addressing Dr. Hessen&#39;s purse] - I&#39;m sorry I feasted upon your brethren. Let me live, and it&#39;ll never happen again, I promise. Just have mercy. [Addressing Dr. Hessen] What is the nature of your immunity to SCP-729-J&#39;s effects? 
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Hessen:** Properties? I mean, it&#39;s a plushie. I have it right here. [Dr. Hessen begins removing SCP-729-J oh god does she think we want that thing anywhere near us?!]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Yvaine:** NO NO NO FUCK GET THAT THING AWAY FROM ME -
&gt;  
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Interview was terminated due to imminent containment breach.
