Whoops, I didn&#39;t know you were coming. I didn&#39;t think anyone came to this part of the Library anymore. I guess my rhyming wasn&#39;t making any sense right now, huh? It&#39;s like rap, I think. Oh dear, I&#39;m not entirely sure how much time has passed since I last heard about it...

Sorry, what was that?

It&#39;s about me. Before I became a Page. But don&#39;t worry about that now. What would you like help with?

Oui, je comprends le français...Oh sorry, I don&#39;t speak Esperanto...Are you looking for something?

Hmm, yes, I&#39;ve heard that before. I can redirect you to that shelf. I heard he was a decent writer before he passed away.

Oh, you thought I was him? No, no, I don&#39;t have anything to do with him. Here, take a look at some of these images some Wanderers have made and tell me what you think. I can bring the shelf here in a moment. It&#39;s really no big deal at this point; my body has severely taken a turn for the...Stronger.

Everything [[*user Avelon21]] has posted so far here:

[[module ListPages order=&#34;created_at desc&#34; created_by=&#34;Avelon21&#34; separate=&#34;no&#34; tags=&#34;prose, verse, narrative, collection, co-authored, entry&#34;]]
* %%title_linked%%, with a rating of %%rating%%
[[/module]]

Other things that [[*user Avelon21]] has contributed to:

* [[[Horse People]]], a rewrite (semi-illegal, haha).
* [[[The Bibliovores]]], a co-authored piece for Turf Wars.
* [[[Field Guide to the Shelves, Volume One]]], a co-authored piece.
* [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/library-theme-songs Collected Musical Manifestations of Thematically Cohesive Areas in Our Library, Circa 2020], in which I composed one song, &#34;Repository of Peace&#34;.
* Everything I&#39;ve reviewed and revised.
* Staff stuff, like the W&#39;s Station and W&#39;s Depths
* ...And other entries on collaboration pages.

Note From Avelon: I am a moderator and chronic reviewer for the Wanderer&#39;s Library. If you have any questions about the site or myself, feel free to contact me through Wikidot or Discord.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Just In Case...&#34; hide=&#34;Go read some of my stuff now.&#34; hideLocation=&#34;both&#34;]]

If I become inactive for an extended period of time, which I will leave to the discretion of staff, I allow for [[*user UncertaintyCrossing]] to do as they see fit with my works and talk things over with staff, if deletion or rewriting or image replacement is needed. Anything co-authored will fall to the possession of co-authors. Any collaborative pages will go to whoever has contributed the most/is the most currently active. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever actually produce anything monumental enough that needs my upkeep in the future, but if anyone needs me...Well I don&#39;t know, maybe I&#39;ll make friends soon before I leave and they&#39;ll have my contact info.

If anything listed above goes awry, I trust the review team of the Wanderer&#39;s Library.

[[span style=&#34;color:white&#34;]] If you want to be a reviewer and need some additional help/training, just ask me. Ask for the Men in Coats. [[/span]]
