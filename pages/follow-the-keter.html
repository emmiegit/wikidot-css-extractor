//Note: The following audio log was recovered from security cameras inside of SCP-682&#39;s containment cell during Incident 682-076-1JF4D-NA5, in which SCP-076-2 breached containment and engaged in combat with SCP-682. For the full incident report, please refer to Document 682-076-1JF4D-NA5.//

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**SCP-076-2:** You say you fucked my mother? I&#39;ll fucking kill you, man. Nobody fucks with A-to-the B L E.

**SCP-682:** Ho ass bitch, you just wish you was me. Stop playing, maybe I&#39;ll spare you.

[!--
SCP-076-02: You&#39;re just mad cuz BasedGod fucked all your bitches.

SCP-682: BasedGod tried to fuck all my bitches, but they are lizards and he isn&#39;t in to bestiality.
--]

**SCP-076:** Yea, yea, yea, yea, alright boy, this time you asked for it!
A vat of acid, that&#39;s your decorum?
Check my swag, I&#39;m back in a black case
Just in case you missed the memo, I&#39;m based!

I&#39;m the king of the hill, as real as they come,
You was probably rich, but I came from the slums.
A heart of darkness, but I came the farthest,
Your flow is retarded, if I want beef then I&#39;ll start it!

**SCP-682:** I killed you before, I can do it some more.
I&#39;m getting hundreds, you got twenties, but lemme settle the score.
No cheap ass screwball from off the street
Can withstand the weight beneath 682&#39;s feet!

I&#39;m the out-of-town gangster, major shot-caller,
I call guard&#39;s necks snapbacks, which I brought back, holla,
I&#39;m a straight up baller, rhyming sicker than HOVA,
You the son of a gun, I scare the fuck out Jehova.

**SCP-076:** Ay yo, let&#39;s be real, eh?
I&#39;m the realest realist, I never change,
You have to adapt and move, can&#39;t stick with one flow
But I can spit so hot that my fucking mouth glows.

What&#39;s your killcount total? Every time I win!
The greatest warrior of all time, the rhymes I spin,
The lives chagrined at the child of Him,
And the Grandson of the One, I&#39;m able to spit, bitch.

**SCP-682:** Hahaha, call that a line, close your eyes and stay alive
You can die from minutes with me, and yes, I&#39;ve tried.
Call yourself a superhero when you&#39;re really super queer, yo,
Yo shit&#39;s cheesier than Cheetos, gayer than a speedo.

Sorry, when&#39;s the last time I lost my life? Never!
You can&#39;t live more than a few years, but me? Forever!
You can die and come back, fag, and get smacked.
My casual causality actually gets stacks.

Weak from the human pussy you got? Please.
You get less than that ████ SCP-073.
I take mine, stay fly, make Rights get wide
I&#39;m a killer all day, all night. Alright?

682, a legendary number,
Cuz a real OG went and made it a Wonder.
I got so many pocket dimensions, call them lint,
I see your eensy weensy knives and their even littler glint

**SCP-076:** The smallest knife I got outreaches your body,
at 100 percent, yet, to which you never get,
Then I whip out the swagger dagger, old school like Atari
and knock off your right side, bitch, match, game and set!

You just a real hater, and you been recorded saying it.
You play the game just to win, but I play it to play it.
A primordial beast, you disgusting, fuck this,
So push me, pussy, I&#39;ve been wanting to cut the shit.

//Note: At this point, SCP-682 became even more enraged and pounced on SCP-076-2. After ██ seconds, vital signs for SCP-076-2 ceased.//

**SCP-682:** Come at me, bro.
