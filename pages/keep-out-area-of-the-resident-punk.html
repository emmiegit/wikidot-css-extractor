It&#39;s not uncommon for people to lose their precious trinkets in the Library. Luckily for the poor fools, thieves are unwelcome here. A kleptomaniac will really rarely go unpunished, and our Patrons are good hearted enough to help return what was lost...//For the most part that is.//

Now it is your turn to be a good samaritan.

Searching around the never ending halls, you found something of interest, peeking almost unnoticed from an undisclosed corner:
A really hefty notebook, and no one around to claim it.

D√©j√† vu shivered down your spine, a sense of familiarity when you got closer and picked it up as curiosity took the best of you. You definitely have seen this before, but where?
A quick run through, and it appears most if not all its pages are filled to the brim with colorful scribbles, as well as notes and loose papers all
over the place. Its owner seemed to be an artist at heart, albeit an extremely messy one. How cute.

The very first page showed this:

[[image keepout.jpg]]

A clear warning for strangers, and a name in stylish caligraphy. A monstruous jaw greeting whoever opened it.

A jaw...

A-

**//...Ah, of course is Maw&#39;s. Who else?//**

You&#39;ll return this next time you meet them. It&#39;s the least you could do, of course.

On the meantime...Well, a little peak never hurt nobody, didn&#39;t it? Let&#39;s see if they wrote or drew something new since last time.

**Its not very often I dwell with other Hand members, but one of them wanted me to draw --propaganda-- something showing respectful distaste for the Foundies.**
**They really liked it! Also said they&#39;d share it around and recomend my work to others. GG, more clout for me.**
**I made a blatant music reference too because I could.**

**What are these doing here.**

**This is not my fucking artstyle nor handwriting. This shit appears out of nowhere. Everytime I rip them off, they show up again.**
**I can&#39;t even erase them, not even the pencil ones.**
**Sometimes there&#39;s art of me, sometimes it&#39;s art of others, some of which I know. Still, someone is using my fucking book to draw and I&#39;m going to have a few words when I find the funny fucker.**

//It was apparent you and the officer weren&#39;t alone, for you felt watched all the way through this seemingly empty dock.//
//The culprit of your discomfort showed themselves soon enough: A person sitting up in the cranes, smirking with a weasel-like visage at the passers-by below. Mismatched eyes stared at you both from above with a sparkle of not so subtle curiosity, as the wind played with their hair and tattered clothes.//
//The rugrat suddenly called for you://

&#34;Aye, like what you see, coppers? What&#39;cha staring at so intensely, never seen a wanderer before?&#34;

**[Inland Empire: SUCCESS]** //You have the feeling this raggedy youngster knows more than what they have the right to.//
