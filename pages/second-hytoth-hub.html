**Overview:** The Church of the Second Hytoth is an occult organization of human and alien entities that adhere to the extraterrestrial Ortothan religion, aiming to aid a universal guardian deity (&#34;Rakmou-leusan&#34;) in combat against extrauniversal threats (known as &#34;Voruteut&#34;). The central beliefs of the religion are that the current universe, the &#34;Second Hytoth,&#34; was preceded by a different universe, which used to exist until it was consumed by an extrauniversal entity. A group of survivors fled to the newly created Second Hytoth, our reality, with seven of them choosing to ascend to godhood to ensure the universe&#39;s safety. Six of these gods died over time, leaving Rakmou-leusan as the last survivor.

The majority of actions taken by the group are performed underneath the Veil, at times resulting in minor conflicts with the Foundation or other normalcy organizations. Group members tend to be proficient in occult practices such as thaumaturgy and limited theurgy; caution should be taken in all interactions with them. Known leaders are Koru Archpriest Farah Onteus, overall head of the Church, the &#34;Second Messenger,&#34; an extraterrestrial group leader, and Grand Aímact Priest Sean Glen-Marcas, head of the Toronto Ortothan Church.

Human Ortothan belief systems are known to have existed by ~11000 BCE, corresponding to the formation of the ancient Ortothan Kingdom civilization, though modern branches have only been developed in the past century (//refer to Terrestrial Groups for further infromation//). Ortothan groups separate from the Church exist, all being significantly smaller in comparison and tending to have differing moral beliefs. Beyond the Church, the Ortothan religion has an interstellar and intergalactic presence, having initially emerged among extraterrestrial civilizations. Numerous such Ortothan civilizations are known to exist, with their full extent not yet ascertained (//refer to Extraterrestrial Groups for further information//).

Information on factions connected to GoI-3088 is available in the following document.

**Status:** Inactive

**Overview:** The Earthen Ortothan Kingdom, more commonly known as the Ortothan Kingdom, was a civilization formed by prehistoric humans around 11000 BCE. Current records indicate this was spurred by the arrival of an extraterrestrial entity referred to as the &#34;Star-Fallen Messenger&#34; in ancient texts (the &#34;First Messenger&#34; in modern ones). The civilization rapidly grew, theorized to be from a combination of aid from the First Messenger and the increased human use of thaumaturgic practices at this time. Documents from [[[SCP-1726]]] have provided useful information, though full details on the Kingdom&#39;s society and history are not known.

Several centuries later they engaged in the Ortothan-Daevic War (c. 11000), a defensive struggle against  [[[SCP-140|Daevite]]] territorial expansion. After continuous fighting defenses faltered and Daevites forces invaded, bringing about the Kingdom&#39;s collapse. Ortothans survived and attempted to rebuild several times over the following thousands of years, taking to isolated regions while stealing paratechnology from larger civilizations such as the [[[church-of-the-broken-god-hub|Xia Dynasty]]]. Ultimately the Kingdom was destroyed during the Zeroth Occult War (c. 1600 BCE), a massive anomalous war instigated by the Xia Dynasty and //[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:page-tags/tag/children-of-the-torch#pages|Huǒjù zhi Zi]]]// predecessors that culminated in a [[[SCP-2481|CK-Class reality restructuring scenario]]], wiping out countless ancient civilizations from this time and the preceding thousands of years. Significantly smaller Ortothan groups survived the event and continued Ortothan traditions up to the modern era.

**Area of Operations:** Earth, the Moon

**Threat Level:** Unknown ##gray|●##

**Status:** Undetermined

**Overview:** SoI-002 was an enigmatic species that attempted to colonize Earth during the late Neoproterozoic Era,[[footnote]]A geologic time frame from 1,000 to 541 million years ago, notable for severe glaciation where ice sheets covered most of the planet and the evolution of the earliest known multicellular organisms.[[/footnote]] ~700 million years ago. Due to the timespan between their arrival into the solar system and the present day, a majority of their artifacts and structures have been lost. Surviving relics suggest their civilization possessed highly advanced technology that commonly integrated esoteric practices and psionics, the latter of which seems to have been innate to all SoI-002 members.

Although SoI-002 was predominately Ortothan, minority groups existed that worshiped the Koru-teusa but aimed to use the manipulation of biological matter and the worship of a flesh deity to provide the gods with a continuous supply of blood. These groups were ostracized and destroyed out of the belief they followed the Voruteut. No connections with human [[[sarkicism-hub|Sarkicism]]] are known to exist, but it is hypothesized that anomalous entities responsible for Sarkic culture were involved in the development of these minorities.

The cause of extinction and the failure in colonization is unknown. Continued activity from SoI-002 anomalies is under investigation.

**Status:** Active

**Overview:** The Terzan 2 Ortothan Coalition[[footnote]]Note that this name for the Coalition is not used by the group; it is unknown what name is in use.[[/footnote]] is a loose militaristic alliance of extraterrestrial Ortothan civilizations and entities residing within Globular Cluster Terzan 2,[[footnote]]Called &#34;Opened Star Cluster&#34; by inhabitants.[[/footnote]] a star cluster orbiting the Milky Way Galaxy ~28,000 light-years from Earth, within the galactic core. The Coalition formed as a response to Twelve Stars, an expansionist civilization which caused past wars in the cluster and is presently assaulting Ortothan territory; the motivations for this are unclear, but current aims seem to be the complete eradication of Ortothan culture in the cluster. The war has not spread from Terzan 2, though Twelve Stars attacks in other regions of the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy have been reported.

Extraterrestrial communities residing within Terzan 2 have been known to the Foundation since initial investigations into alien life under the Pytheas Initiative. Continued observation from Earth found that Terzan 2 is one of the most active regions of the galaxy in terms of the amount of extraterrestrial transmissions. Recent advancements in the faster-than-light engines have enabled exploration, though difficulties in superluminal travel, communication with the Coalition, and the wartime conditions have limited available information on the group.

Manned exploration of Terzan 2 is in progress.

++ Mythos

According to Ortothan mythology, prior to existence was the &#34;Voru,&#34; a chaotic nonexistence in which minds and matter would continually emerge and be destroyed. At some point an unknown deity created the &#34;First Hytoth,&#34; a first universe sheltered from the dangers of the Voru. The universe existed for billions of years until an extrauniversal entity, entirely unnamed in all recovered Ortothan documents, consumed the universe and destroyed it.

A small group of beings survived the consumption, all of whom had escaped into the Voru for safety until the deity that created the First Hytoth created a new universe in the form of the Second Hytoth. The survivors &#34;drilled&#34; into the Second Hytoth, settling in the expanding spacetime, and seven leaders of the survivors grouped together, vowing to prevent the new universe from being destroyed as well. These seven then ascended to godhood and became the Holy Seven (the &#34;Koru-teusa&#34;).

The Koru-teusa were active in the early universe, spreading religious beliefs intended to raise support for themselves while fighting against entities that posed a threat to the universe. In order to maintain divine states the Koru-teusa required a constant source of blood, a consequence of how blood continually leaked from their new forms,[[footnote]]Attributed to an imperfection in the ascension process.[[/footnote]] which necessitated bloodletting rituals to maintain their health. However, their influence gradually decreased over time, with lowered influence decreasing the number of bloodletting rituals followers would perform. Members of the Koru-teusa progressively died, the last death being that of the Holy Sixth (&#34;Yorun-leusan&#34;) in 2000.

The only member of the seven said to remain alive is the Holy Fourth (&#34;Rakmou-leusan&#34;). Rakmou-leusan protects against extrauniversal entities (&#34;Voruteut&#34;) that are trying to invade the universe as a means of escaping the Voru&#39;s chaos, a process which will in turn destabilize reality if not prevented. How much longer Rakmou-leusan can continue to fight for is unknown.

++ Treatment of the Mythos

Unusually for religious Groups of Interest, the Church of the Second Hytoth does not hold a central canon for its mythos. Instead the group believes that, while it knows much on its pantheon and cosmology, it lacks full knowledge on reality and that the Ortothan mythos itself is an incomplete view of existence. This owes to various unknowns that present in the mythos, the two most noteworthy ones being the near-complete loss of information on the Holy Fifth and Holy Seventh, and contradictions between different Ortothan sources.

As a result, the organization aims to fully learn all aspects of the universe as a means to complete Ortothan mythology. The group&#39;s &#34;Branch of History&#34; employs scholars to seek out missing information and, with the aid of their warriors, obtain artifacts relevant to this cause. Central subjects of research include the Holy Fifth, the Holy Seventh, the First Hytoth, and the Earthen Ortothan Kingdom (//see Terrestrial Groups for further information//). Considered less likely to be learned yet still sought for are the identity of the deity that created the First and Second Hytoths, its motivations, and what the entity that consumed the First Hytoth was.

++ Behavior and Organization Details

The goals of the Church of the Second Hytoth are:
* To preserve of Rakmou-leusan&#39;s life through bloodletting rituals.
* To spread the Ortothan religion and morals based on the actions of Rakmou-leusan.
* To research the Ortothan pantheon, the First Hytoth, and unknown aspects of the Ortothan mythos.
* To kill any and all Voruteut.

The organization is relatively small and pacifistic towards those unrelated to the Voruteut, though they are active on a global scale. Multiple churches are operated in major cities, the largest being in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, many of which exist in Way-accessible pocket dimensions.[[footnote]]The central church is the Jena Ortothan Church, accessible in Jena, Thuringia, Germany.[[/footnote]] Secretive raids have been performed under Operation VIOLET LENSE but the recent inclusion of ritualistic cryptography systems in Way entrances has stalled further raid attempts.

Ortothan entities originating from other regions of the Milky Way Galaxy, the Second Messenger included, are prominent members of the group. Common origins of them have been the evacuation of their home star systems and attempts at interstellar proselytization. As such the organization holds vast amounts of knowledge on extrasolar phenomena and locations, more than the Foundation presently has. Human group members use alien technology routinely.

It is of note that, despite these connections to extrasolar life, the Church itself lacks any contact with alien Ortothan groups. Whether extrasolar Ortothans are even aware of the existence of the Church of the Second Hytoth or not is a matter of continued research.

++ Culture

Church of the Second Hytoth doctrine stems from a following in morals based on Rakmou-leusan&#39;s actions, commonly referred to as the organization&#39;s central tenets. Core to the tenets are the ability to think strategically, to remain curious about the world, and to display kindness and peace to those who are not enemies. The following of the tenets influences much of the actions taken by both Church members and the Church as a whole, causing them to avoid conflict unless no alternatives exist. In turn they are on neutral relations with a number of Groups of Interest and have a small percentage of members who are also connected to other anomalous religions.

The mingling of human and extraterrestrial cultures has been recorded, albeit only in situations where sufficient similarities exist. This has resulted in a unique cultural identity among the Church, where human members are receptive to alien concepts, even those that would normally be incomprehensible. Prominent concepts are the belief in latent non-dimensional &#34;bridges&#34; that link how entities familiar with one another perceive the world, greetings where individuals briefly turn sideways and avoid facing each other directly,[[footnote]]Direct facing during a greeting being seen as a sign of aggression.[[/footnote]] the use of cybernetic LED implants that alter skin color as means of communication, &#34;tasting&#34; colors beyond the EM spectrum, and, in small subsects, the organization of individuals into hivemind-like systems.[[footnote]]Said systems formed with the intent of maximizing efficiency and collective happiness.[[/footnote]]

Multiple holidays originate in extraterrestrial practices, an example being the &#34;regrowth days&#34; where group members isolate themselves from the outside world as much as possible to solely consume food and rest, derived from how certain alien species would enter &#34;regrowth machines&#34; to rejuvenate after long periods of work. These cultures are not ubiquitous through the Church, though, and it is encouraged that Ortothan practices take precedence for all members.

++ Subsects

While the Church focuses primarily on the worship of Rakmou-leusan and the other Koru-teusa, smaller sects with differing beliefs and practices exist within it. These sects often involve aiding the group&#39;s goals via the worship of additional deities in the Ortothan pantheon or ones beyond it, believing that all gods must unite in protecting the universe from the Voruteut. More rarely are sects that follow different moral practices while still adhering to the central tenets of the group, which are accepted but are viewed with disdain.

Ortothan groups not aligning with the Church of the Second Hytoth&#39;s tenets are ignored and excluded. In situations where an Ortothan group is acting in ways the Church views as bringing negative attention to the religion and is in conflict with their morals, an example being ritualistic murder to supply Rakmou-leusan with blood, warriors will be sent to stop the group&#39;s actions.

]]

++ Capabilities

Full capabilities of the Church are unknown. Most members are proficient in at least one form of occult practice, and members commonly attempt theurgy with entities said to be minor deities in the Ortothan pantheon. In combination with advanced technology brought by extraterrestrial members, the organization is believed to have high offensive capabilities, though there are no signs that this will ever be used against the Foundation or humanity as a whole.

Outside sources have claimed that the organization possesses knowledge of ritual needed to, assuming Ortothan mythos is correct, summon an avatar of Rakmou-leusan. Investigation into the potential for a Λ,,0,, Eschatological Scenario is being performed.

++ Language

The group speaks a combination of native languages and the Ortothan Extraterrestrial Language (OEL), which has been anomalously preserved since an unknown point in time. While spoken OEL varies heavily or does not exist among certain species, the logograms used in written OEL are largely consistent across all Ortothan cultures, regardless of the amount of separation between them[[footnote]]Exceptions to this being logograms representing non-human concepts and ones foreign to non-human Ortothans.[[/footnote]]. According to the Church, this is the result of a divine act by the Koru-teusa to maintain the unification of all Ortothan cultures in the universe.

Work on fully deciphering OEL as a means of efficient communication with extraterrestrial entities is in progress.

++ Interstellar and Intergalactic Reaches

The Ortothan religion exists on interstellar scales in the form of various loosely connected sects. Research into these sects has proved to be a challenging process. Discovering the location of a sect is, in cases where it is not broadcasting powerful EM radiation signals and where no outside aid exists,  a matter of chance, and discovered sects can be radically different from human cultures to the point where a full understanding of them is impossible. Limitations in existing faster-than-light engines further hinder exploration.

Despite the difficulties, the Extrasolar Activities Division has made substantial findings. Of all recorded extraterrestrial civilizations, approximately 8% are Ortothan in nature, with these civilizations ranging in technological capabilities from near-human levels to levels surpassing all theorized anomalous technology. As is to be expected, extraterrestrial Ortothan cultures often diverge from Church mindsets, some taking to violent practices as methods for aiding Rakmou-leusan with blood or, for species lacking blood, an equivalent vital substance. Interstellar conflicts between Ortothan civilizations with differing cultures have been observed on occasion.

Little information exists on extragalactic spread. If Ortothan mythology is to be believed then Ortothan cultures are present on massive scales, but without the ability to perform intergalactic travel no research can be performed.

Aside from small groups of extraterrestrials that have arrived on Earth in one-way trips, no extrasolar Ortothan civilizations are active in the Solar System, attributed to a lack of valuable resources and noteworthy features compared to other stellar regions. The only civilization known to have been active is Species of Interest-002 (//refer to Extraterrestrial Groups for further information).// The group is presumed to be extinct.

&gt; //Advice from// [[*user NatVoltaic]]
&gt; ------
&gt; The Church of the Second Hytoth and other Ortothan groups are wide and varied in beliefs, structure, and composition, but they all share one commonality: they refuse to give up. Even with all but one of their gods dead, they strive to keep Rakmou-leusan alive, constantly working to spread their beliefs and aid in the fight against the Voruteut. They are determined to win against cosmic horror no matter the eldritch monsters and existential dread. They are certain they will win.
&gt; 
&gt; This won&#39;t always be apparent in articles, though. Tone-wise the stories involving the Ortothans can be far from hopeful, some veering hard into [[[SCP-2821|existential]]] [[[SCP-2742|horror]]], and individual Ortothans themselves could easily lose faith in what seems to be a ceaseless, worsening conflict. However, Ortothan groups as whole do not consider failure an option. And if [[[SCP-1548|failure]]] does happen they will still keep going. This perseverance in the face of cosmic horrors and universal stakes is part of what sets Ortothans apart from other groups involving the eldritch, and keeping it in mind is key to writing the group well.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, whatever you do, //don&#39;t write the Church of the Second Hytoth as a generic evil blood cult.// The group was intended from the start to be an inversion on blood cults (being pacifistic instead of violent and having a justified reason for blood rites beyond &#34;BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD&#34;) and, while there is nothing wrong with writing other Ortothan groups as despicable (alien Ortothans are bound to have different morals than humans, for instance), the Church and the majority of Ortothan groups will not act that way. Daevites are more suited towards it than the Church is.

++ Tips On Style:

In addition to what is mentioned in the words of advice above, it&#39;s important to have a good sense of style when writing for the Church, which is going to vary wildly if you are writing for the Ortothan Kingdom compared to the Terzan 2 Ortothan Coalition. For some pointers on directions to take things:

* **Ortothan Kingdom and Far Past Ortothans:** Think high fantasy with an SCP Wiki flair. At the time of the Ortothan-Daevic War Asia is effectively a Tolkien setting in its wide variety of anomalous civilizations and cultures, all taking their own strange directions that could only truly work on the Wiki -- Daevite retrocausal weirdness being a big example. At the time of the Zeroth Occult War the scene is similar yet the introduction of the Xia Dynasty brings with it sci-fi paratech, which, with the War raging on, turns into an apocalyptic battlefield of gods and steel and fantastical forces.

* **The Church of the Second Hytoth:** The Church carries a weird blend of the Wiki&#39;s urban fantasy paired with cosmic sci-fi. Aliens are mages and human mages carry alien technology with them, all the while underlined with grand, occult themes of defending existence itself. It&#39;s a truly bizarre mishmash of styles but this mishmash is what sets the Church apart from all religious GoIs like it. Angling hard into it with your Church writing is sure to lead to unique results.

* **Extraterrestrial Ortothans:** This is where you can truly lean hard into the sci-fi. Galactic exploration, interstellar war, and untold secrets between the stars are all be common themes, coming with it the ability to have wide ranging anomalies and bizarre settings. However, in writing Ortothan extraterrestrials there still needs to be some connection to the overall mythology and/or religion. It&#39;s also advised that you angle more towards hard sci-fi -- that is, science fiction that feels scientifically accurate or &#34;realistic.&#34; In the case of the Second Hytoth, well, you&#39;re writing about mystical stuff. Complete realism is impossible. You can make things feel &#34;real,&#34; however, by having technology and magic run on underlying internal logic, rather than handwaving explanations completely, producing a sense of &#34;realism&#34; in the process. How much you want to do this is up to you, though, and if your story works better without it then by all means ditch it.
 * //A sidenote:// Eldritch horror and sci-fi can fit surprisingly well together. Aliens vastly unlike humanity and technology unfathomably advanced are all perfect ways to use science fiction ideas to create truly Lovecraftian, otherworldly settings.

* **The Ortothan Gods Themselves:** Hard sci-fi can go out the window here. You&#39;ll now be dealing with cosmic forces beyond physics as we understand them, beings which can destroy worlds at ease and turn swaths of space into debris even with simple battles between their avatars. Articles focusing on the Koru-teusa and the pantheon as a whole should carry this divine grandness with it, especially in conflicts between them. However, that&#39;s not to say you can&#39;t invert this expectation.
 
* **Extrauniversal Anomalies:** Eldritch horror away! Whether it&#39;s the Voruteut, remnants of the First Hytoth, or things far stranger, the same themes of impossible horrors and the vast unknown will inevitably arise. This style is far from new so one should tread with caution to avoid falling into the same old tropes, but when done effectively it can produce some of the best horror possible. A recommended way to keep things fresh is to combine the horror with other styles, such as hard sci-fi ([[[SCP-2821]]] being an example). Even if it doesn&#39;t go radically new directions, simply having a different style can go a long way to make it feel unique.

[[div class=&#34;saduj&#34;]]

++ In following the morals of the Fourth...

&gt; = **STRATEGY**
&gt; 
&gt; The Fourth is the greatest of strategists. They do not charge head-first into combat; they analyze situations before making their move, and when they do they are sure to emerge victorious. Following this mindset is sure to result in further victory for the Church and the Ortothan religion as a whole.

&gt; = **KINDNESS**
&gt; 
&gt; By showing kindness to the first followers of the Koru-teusa and by forbidding violence in the pursuit of blood, Rakmou-leusan allowed for Ortothans to be respected by the other deities of the young Second Hytoth and the civilizations of those early days. Peace lead to our survival. To stay peaceful is to stay Ortothan.

&gt; = **CURIOSITY**
&gt; 
&gt; It is through remaining open to the unknowns of reality has Rakmou-leusan succeeded. If they believed they knew all there was to know they would not have discovered the tear in the universe and the Voruteut entering through it, nor would they have realized the danger of the Voruteut. With curiosity we stay aware of the world and all that it may send our way.

&gt; = **STRENGTH**
&gt; 
&gt; Never has the Fourth given up. No matter the number of dead gods, no matter the onslaught the invaders bring, no matter the betrayals and attacks of other deities. Rakmou-leusan&#39;s hope has never been lost and it never will be. It is the optimism we must all carry as we set out to defend reality. It is what we must hold onto as we stand as the shields against the torrential horrors that bombard existence.

+ The Holy Seven, Our Defenders
[[/=]]

&gt; ++ **Zeyu-leusan**, the Holy First
&gt; ++ Dead
&gt; 
&gt; Zeyu-leusan was the first leader of the Koru-teusa. They discovered the rituals of ascendency, turning the seven Holy, and brought guidance and order when it was needed most in the newly emerging universe. Their sole weapon was their right hand. In it the might of a trillion stars burned and from the stump of their severed left arm they drew in the ambient energy of the cosmos, poised to destroy opponents in an instant. No other god has matched this strength.
&gt; 
&gt; They were the first of the Koru-teusa to die, honorably sacrificing themselves to destroy the First Invasion of Voruteut, their whole life essence directed into a single holy lance. In respect the First Ortothans constructed a galaxy-sized memorial to Zeyu-leusan, though it has since decayed from continued Voruteut attacks.

&gt; ++ **Uron-leusan**, the Holy Second
&gt; ++ Dead
&gt; 
&gt; The divine swordsman. On ascension they ripped two swords from space&#39;s fabric and plunged them through the higher realms of existence, melding the weapons with entire existential planes. Their strength faded as the aeons progressed but Uron-leusan&#39;s skill and utter devotion to combat kept them feared by all the gods.
&gt; 
&gt; Envy brought their demise. Eov-leusan&#39;s accomplishments earned higher praise and recognition, bringing scorn from Uron-leusan that only increased with time. Eventually logic caved. They attacked Eov-leusan, and despite Rakmou-leusan&#39;s attempts to stop the combat both were killed. It was one of the greatest tragedies Ortothans have ever faced.

&gt; ++ **Eov-leusan**, the Holy Third
&gt; ++ Dead
&gt; 
&gt; Eov-leusan was unusual compared to the other Seven. On ascendence they did not attempt to forge new weapons; instead they built upon their old ones constantly over several millennia, turning recluse at points to ensure uninterrupted construction. The result of their work: three ascended cannons of metal, dark matter, and the blood that leaked from their body. On the first test fire it is said the shockwaves of its blast were felt through every corner of the universe.
&gt; 
&gt; Through the Era of Gods they became one of the most renowned of the Koru-teusa, if only for how easy it was to witness the firing of the ascended cannons. However, their glory came to an end when Uron-leusan attacked, and in retaliation Eov-leusan amassed a legion of their followers to attack. In the end a patch of emptied spacetime, smoldering with residual plasmas and energies, was all that was left.

&gt; ++ ##6B0803|**Rakmou-leusan**, the Holy Fourth##
&gt; ++ **Alive**
&gt; 
&gt; The last of the Seven. They wield the Four Spears, tools that can fold themselves into any shape and form necessary for combat. When Zeyu-leusan died they took the mantle of leader of the Koru-teusa, and as the threat of the Voruteut worsened they dedicated themselves to universal defense. We practice their teachings and their morals, and we will fight alongside them till eternity ends. They are in service of existence and in that service we follow.

&gt; ++ **Nesren-leusan**, the Holy Fifth 
&gt; ++ Forgotten
&gt; 
&gt; A master of psionics that all the worlds forgot. From their body stretched a fifth arm of psychic radiance, blinding the minds that witnessed it and were touched by Nesren-leusan&#39;s thoughtforms. Despite their skill, at a point thousands of years ago information on them lessened, and Ortothans, now spread thin across the cosmos, without realizing what was happening forgot Nesren-leusan existed. When it was remembered all panicked attempts to resume bloodletting to the Holy Fifth failed; the rituals did not transfer the blood. There was no target for it to be sent.
&gt; 
&gt; The common belief is that the Fifth encountered &#34;something.&#34; Something that made the world forget, made the world believe they need not sacrifice their blood for a fifth god, made the universe pass them by as they bled out and withered into nothingness. It is a belief, though. The true story is yet to be uncovered.

&gt; ++ **Yorun-leusan**, the Holy Sixth
&gt; ++ Dead
&gt; 
&gt; Oft referred to as the Holy Mage, Yorun-leusan was a practicer of all occult practices and esoteric teachings. In their time they would send out their avatars in search of even the most obscure of teachings, hoping to amass a complete knowledge on the underlying mechanisms of existence. In place of weapons they held six staffs, means of focusing and directing their magical acts.
&gt; 
&gt; Alongside Rakmou-leusan they lasted long past the rest of the Koru-teusa. In 1900, the year of our Church&#39;s founding, they were still alive, having chosen to reinforce the defenses of their Eitoth with their presence as the Fourth went to combat the Voruteut. Ultimately they fell in 2000, unable to repel one of the largest Voruteut invasions in history before Rakmou-leusan could bring aid. Though their death has brought much sorrow their practices had influenced generations of thaumaturges, inspiring them to stay interested in all secrets the world can offer. For as long as the Church stands their legacy will not be forgotten.

&gt; ++ **Myran-leusan**, the Holy Seventh
&gt; ++ Lost
&gt; 
&gt; No information exists. Nesren-leusan was forgotten but it&#39;s as though Myran-leusan ceased to be, their abilities and exploits vanished from every tome and every library. As if they never existed. The only signs they held a presence are common knowledge of it and scraps of what may have been recorded information, torn or burnt or blotted beyond comprehension. We assume they are dead but even that is uncertain.
&gt; 
&gt; We don&#39;t know, and it is possible nobody ever will know.
&gt; 
&gt; They were simply lost.

&gt; ++ The Second Hytoth
&gt; 
&gt; Our multiverse. Our universe is the central &#34;hub&#34; for the Second Hytoth, from which all other universes and pocket dimensions and higher existential planes radiate in a fractallic web. To put it into views my fellow human readers will understand, the Second Hytoth is like an island, where our universe is the ground and all other worlds are the trees and grass stretching from it.
&gt; 
&gt; This leads to an important note: our universe is what keeps all other anchored. If ours falls to Voruteut invasion, so do the rest. Escape through Ways is not on option.
&gt; 
&gt; +++ Important Locales:
&gt; 
&gt; * **The Eitoth:** The Ortothan afterlife. Most tomes hold it to be a sphere of ethereal brilliance larger than entire galaxies, constructed by the first followers of the Koru-teusa under Zeyu-leusan&#39;s supervision to ensure all Ortothans can experience eternity blissfully. On death one&#39;s mind is whisked there, joining with endless other minds in a beautiful world, one no living beings have ever seen.
&gt; 
&gt; * **The Voreik:** A gaping wound in the universe, from which the Voruteut attempt to pour through. The region around it is shredded; after so much invasion little to no life can persist there. Rakmou-leusan keeps their eternal watch here, protecting all from destruction.

&gt; ++ The First Hytoth
&gt; 
&gt; The &#34;prototype&#34; for existence. If our few sources on it are to be believed it was a multiverse in perpetual turmoil. Gods waged intergalactic war in search of domains to rule, minor deities fought one another in the wake of the gods&#39; acts, and the lowest civilizations tried desperately to persist. Peace was established on occasion but it always collapsed as soon as it began.
&gt; 
&gt; Virtually nothing survived the First Hytoth&#39;s destruction, but every now and then a fragment of it resurfaces, entering the Second Hytoth or brushing against and connecting to its web of universes. These fragments -- objects or pocket dimensions or, rarely, entities -- are scarce, but when found they can be one of few information sources available to us.

&gt; ++ The Voru
&gt; 
&gt; If one compares the Second Hytoth to an island, then the Voru is the sea of unreality surrounding it. No order governs it. Things defying our understanding pop in and out of being, sometimes lasting long enough to give the illusion of structure. It is possible to briefly enter the Voru -- originating in reality grants degrees of stability -- but in long durations it is destined for failure. Destabilization will set in, in the best cases causing death or, worse, turning one into a Voruteut.
&gt; 
&gt; The largest opening to the Voru is the Voreik. Deliberate attempts and simple random fluctuations in reality can create further holes, but these stay short lived. Tales of multiverse travelers moving down so many dimensions that they fall out of existence and into the Voru have been told, but the validity of these have been debated. It is the same case with claims of spotting worlds in the Voru beyond the Second Hytoth.
&gt; 
&gt; With these unknowns there is only one certainty: what lies out there cannot be allowed in.

&gt; **The God-King of the Stars** — [Alive] — A tyrant that rules over large swaths of intergalactic territory. They are one of the few lesser deities that has confronted the Koru-teusa on multiple occasions, often enlisting the aid of higher deities to do so.
&gt; 
&gt; **The Ones of Light and Dark** -- [Alive] -- Primordial beings that permeate the multiverse, embodying light and dark. Survivors from the First Hytoth that fled with the rest into the new reality.
&gt; 
&gt; **Wonlaik** -- [Dead] -- A hivemind &#34;trickster&#34; deity; slain by Rakmou-leusan after an attempt to destabilize the Eitoth.
&gt; 
&gt; **The Broken Creation** — [##transparent|███##] — A god-shaped hole.

&gt; ++ From the First Hytoth
&gt; 
&gt; **Uravol** -- [Dead] -- A purported lesser deity, who chose to rise up against the far more powerful higher deities. Through psionic mental hijacks Uravol took over numerous gods and ultimately attempted to hijack Nohlos. The attempt resulted in enough psionic backlash to kill Nohlos and render Uravol as a disembodied, broken mind.
&gt; 
&gt; **Nohlos** -- [Dead] -- An eel-like primordial god of the First Hytoth, who consumed reality to survive. It is said to have been killed by Uravol, though its spawn, the Nohl-Av, are known have survived the First Hytoth&#39;s destruction and persist, some [[[SCP-2742|on our own planet.]]]
&gt; 
&gt; **Vsi-Mind Erjo** -- [Dead] -- A purported higher deity, a psychic entity that held trillions of followers in its mental grasp. They were the most powerful deity hijacked by Uravol, and they were killed along with their followers in the failed attempt at hijacking Nohlos.

&gt; ++ From the Voru
&gt; 
&gt; **The Voruteut** -- [N/A] -- Things that emerge from the randomness of the Voru, recognizing their &#34;existence&#34; within the Voru as unstable and struggling to force into the stability of the Second Hytoth. By their nature any Voruteut will damage reality, either attempting to leech from it to stabilize themselves or directly feeding on it for the same purposes. They are not one entity; for as long as there is a Voru there will be infinite of them.
&gt; 
&gt; **Aiv-Zon / The Devourer** -- [Unknown] -- Only named in a single tome, the Devourer was a vast being that tore into the reality of the First Hytoth and consumed all but the most infinitesimal fragments. Only the survivors of the First Hytoth witnessed its terror, and unless ones who have persisted to the present era can be encountered, the full truth on it cannot be learned.

&gt; ++ Others
&gt; 
&gt; **The Nameless Creator** -- [Unknown] -- The presumed creator of the First and Second Hytoths. No one knows what it is, whether it is in the Voru or reality, whether it is alive, or whether it even truly exists. If it exists we hope it regards us fondly. It is all we can pray for.

&gt; ++ Common Ortothan Words and Terms
&gt; 
&gt; As used by human Ortothan civilization. For those intending to commune with alien Ortothans, logograms are recommended for use instead.
&gt; 
&gt; * **Aímact** -- Blood, vital fluids or substances (for entities which lack blood).
&gt; 
&gt; * **Anigon** -- Mystical practices of folding thin materials into geometrically complex forms, such as avatars for the gods to inhabit or vessels for minds, breathing ones life into the materials as it is done. Better known for its mundane equivalent, [[[SCP-2417|origami]]].
&gt; 
&gt; * **Eitothan** -- Relating to the Eitoth.
&gt; 
&gt; * **Eiv-** -- Prefix denoting high standing and importance, typically used in rankings within the Church.
&gt; 
&gt; * **The First Invasion** -- The first massive intrusion of Voruteut into the Second Hytoth, occurring soon after the Voreik was discovered. Zeyu-leusan sacrificed themselves in order to stave it off.
&gt; 
&gt; * **The First Ortothans** -- The very first followers of the Koru-teusa, active in the primordial eras of the universe and responsible for the construction of the Eitoth.
&gt; 
&gt; * **Hytoth** -- A multiverse.
&gt; 
&gt; * **Hytothan** -- Denoting anything that originates from within the multiverse, often as opposed to the Voru.
&gt; 
&gt; * **Koru** -- Highest or holiest.
&gt; 
&gt; * **-leusan** -- Suffix denoting any member of the Koru-teusa, literally translated as &#34;divine warrior of the multiverse.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; * **Ontoth** -- A universe; sometimes used to describe pocket dimensions.
&gt; 
&gt; ++ Cosmological Time Frames
&gt; 
&gt; The main timeframes of the Second Hytoth, as decided by the Church.
&gt; 
&gt; * **The Primordial Aeon** -- Beginning the moment the multiverse came into being. This was the time of the universe&#39;s coalescence, the formation of its galaxies, superclusters, and star systems as the survivors of the First Hytoth and the new emerging life spread.
&gt; 
&gt; * **The Era of Gods** -- Several aeons dominated by the young, rising civilizations and the gods that emerged in the process. These were times of high life, mass strife, and grand victories. The Koru-teusa and the dominating powers that clashed left a mark on the universe that persists to the present day.
&gt; 
&gt; * **The Modern Aeon** -- From the emergence of Ortothan civilizations on Earth onwards. The heavens have quieted, only one of the Koru-teusa remains, and without the rest of the Seven to keep watch the other gods of the universe reengage their disputes and wars. When this will change is unclear.
&gt; 
&gt; ++ Numerology
&gt; 
&gt; Most Ortothan cultures have operated under the same octal number system, the primary numbers of it being as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; ||~ Word||~ Number||
&gt; || Nen || Zero ||
&gt; || Zey || One ||
&gt; || Ur || Two ||
&gt; || Eo || Three ||
&gt; || Rak || Four ||
&gt; || Nes || Five ||
&gt; || Yor || Six ||
&gt; || My || Seven ||
&gt; 
&gt; Additional concepts in Ortothan mathematics include:
&gt; 
&gt; ||~ Concept/Number ||~ Definition ||
&gt; || Forta || [[[SCP-033|Banished for crimes unspoken.]]] The Koru-teusa&#39;s reasons are not known but we trust in them. ||
&gt; || Nen-Exten || Literally &#34;zero-infinities,&#34; sapient mathematical constructs enlisted in calculations that minds and computers are incapable or ordinarily processing. The summoning of them is not recommended for Ortothans unfamiliar with basic 4+ dimensional arithmetic or aversions to math -- they will judge.||
