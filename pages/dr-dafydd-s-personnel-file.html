###009f6b|//What we were, our former names
We aren&#39;t quite sure from where we came.//##
- **Gregory J. Holgate**
[[/=]]

**Name:** Dr. Zachary Taliesin Dafydd

**Security Clearance Level:** 3

**Department:** Department of Anomalous Humanoid Psychology, //Formerly Department of Oneirology Studies//

**Occupation:** Psychoanalysis, Oneirologist, Field Researcher

**Location:** Site-12, //Formerly Site-59//

**Profile:** A steel hand in a cotton glove and an example of the benefits of the Dartmoor Agreement, Dr. Dafydd is one of the Foundation&#39;s greatest assets in anomalous behaviour management and has made significant improvements, resulting in personnel-anomaly cooperation reaching an all-time high in a number of sites. Stationed at Site-12, the good doctor is usually seen either drinking rum spiked tea, studying the latest papers on oneiric therapy, monitoring SCPs&#39; behaviour, or drawing crude pictures of Sidhe in painful positions. **###009f6b|Addressing the Sidhe or related topics around Dr. Dafydd is not recommended.##**

A number of rumours surround Dr. Dafydd. These include his past with the Serpent&#39;s Hand, his ability to speak ###881ee4|**Purple**##, his affair with the Mayor of Three Portland and his grand collection of stuffed toys, his favourite being a rabbit called Blackberry. The one rumour that is circulated the most, however, is the origin of his theriomorphism. Many a time has Dr. Dafydd been asked the reason for his rabbit form and many a time has he provided a possible answer. The most popular answer being, &#34;I really like carrots&#34;, followed by a twitch of the nose.

&gt; Whilst at Site-██, SCP-6879 continued to behave erratically. On top of sleep deprivation, they also began talking in their sleep, resumed thumb sucking and showed signs of isolation and dissociation.

This wasn&#39;t my first SCP idea. I went through about 10 before I finally succeed with this one. Originally, it was supposed to focus solely on 6879 and the Lighthouse. However, as I wrote, I listen to the following [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3IGrj7g0fA song]. This made me rethink my approach and shift focus. One which showed us that Dr. Wondertainment wasn&#39;t the all-loving, toymaker we all believe him/her/them/it to be. I also wanted the Foundation to be the good guys for once. It is nice to have a story once in a while with a happy ending.

This only took me about a month to develop. As this was my second go, I was able to write and format it much faster. I got the idea after reading [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6999 SCP-6999] and the [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/welcome-to-spectral-affairs Spectral Affairs] article, a result of departmentcon2022.

If it&#39;s not obvious, I am Welsh. 

A proud Welshman. Reading a lot of [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/from-120-s-archives-hub F120] and [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/war-on-all-fronts-hub All Fronts], I saw a lot of stuff involving Irish and semi-Celtic mythology and I wanted to do something like that. One of the most important stories of Welsh heritage, and a favourite of mine, are the tales of the Mabinogi, a four-part story that involves magical afterlives, proud kings and monsters like giants, fairies and dragons. Some scholars believe that prior to Britain&#39;s Christianisation, the characters in the stories were considered gods.

Mixed with a sense of pride and admiration, I decided to try and write something both close to my heritage and something that could provide influential material to the wiki. Who knows, maybe I&#39;ll continue this story in the future.

This took some time. Not only because it was over Christmas but also because I struggled with writing in a style found from another period. Luckily, I had help from a very capable writer. This came to me after looking into [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-023 SCP-023] and how the UK appears to be obsessed with ghost doggies. Not all of them are the ooky spooky Hound of the Baskerville kind of dogs but the all do share the death omen air and black coat so I decided to try and tie things together.

My first contest entry ever, this was done for [[[goblincon|Goblin Con]]] for the 6467 entry (Fantasy Goblin). I wanted to do something a little different than what was obvious, and I took inspiration from the myth of the changelings. I had also just finished DC vs. Vampires and Torchwood, so I also took inspiration from the concept of sleeper agents. Adding in some 4000 lore and I was done. Am I proud of it? A little. In hindsight, I think I could&#39;ve done better.

My entry for [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/lorecon2023|The Mighty Lore and Aesthetics Contest]]], where I was given the Constraints of Abstract and Caldeira. This is by far the weirdest SCP I&#39;ve ever done. Not just because it involves a sex focused GoI, but because this all started when someone said, &#34;Pattern Moaners&#34;. I am rather pleased with this one, simply because of how inventive I think it is.

Site-12 has been in the back of my mind ever since I read Site-44&#39;s Dossier. I&#39;ve always like the idea of a site underground but not like the ones found in America. All concrete and dust. I want one with class. So, I made of with history, with mystery and a lovely library.

Real me talking here. The real [[*user arthcymro]]. You can refer to me as Arth.

Been here since Nov 2020, but started making monsters and myths in 2022. ###009f6b|//**Note to newbies, start small.**//## You can thank **[*https://www.youtube.com/c/TheExploringSeries The Exploring Series]** for my presents here. What do I like to write about? Hmmmmm. Not really sure. I guess I prefer the lighter side of things. No world-ending abominations or metaphysical nonsense. I more about the history and the adventures, with maybe some tears shed here and there.

What do I do outside of this?
