###304529|//What we were, our former names
We aren&#39;t quite sure from where we came.//##
- **Gregory J. Holgate**
[[/=]]

**Name:** Dr. Zachary Taliesin Dafydd

**Security Clearance Level:** 3

**Department:** Department of Anomalous Humanoid Psychology, //Formerly Department of Oneirology Studies//

**Occupation:** Psychoanalysis, Oneirologist, Field Researcher

**Location:** Site-12, //Formerly Site-59//

**Profile:** A steel hand in a cotton glove and an example of the benefits of the Dartmoor Agreement, Dr. Dafydd is one of the Foundation&#39;s greatest assets in anomalous behaviour management and has made significant improvements, resulting in personnel-anomaly cooperation reaching an all-time high in a number of sites. Stationed at Site-12, the good doctor is usually seen either drinking rum spiked tea, studying the latest papers on oneiric therapy, monitoring SCPs&#39; behaviour, or drawing crude pictures of Sidhe in painful positions. **###304529|Addressing the Sidhe or related topics around Dr. Dafydd is not recommended.##**

A number of rumours surround Dr. Dafydd. These include his past with the Serpent&#39;s Hand, his ability to speak ###881ee4|**Purple**##, his affair with the Mayor of Three Portland and his grand collection of stuffed toys, his favourite being a rabbit called Blackberry. The one rumour that is circulated the most, however, is the origin of his theriomorphism. Many a time has Dr. Dafydd been asked the reason for his rabbit form and many a time has he provided a possible answer. The most popular answer being, &#34;I really like carrots&#34;, followed by a twitch of the nose.

This wasn&#39;t my first SCP idea. I went through about 10 before I finally succeed with this one. Originally, it was supposed to focus solely on 6879 and the Lighthouse. However, as I wrote, I listen to the following [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3IGrj7g0fA song]. This made me rethink my approach and shift focus. One which showed us that Dr. Wondertainment wasn&#39;t the all-loving, toymaker we all believe him/her/them/it to be. I also wanted the Foundation to be the good guys for once. It is nice to have a story once in a while with a happy ending.

If it&#39;s not obvious, I am Welsh. 

A proud Welshman. Reading a lot of [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/from-120-s-archives-hub F120] and [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/war-on-all-fronts-hub All Fronts], I saw a lot of stuff involving Irish and semi-Celtic mythology and I wanted to do something like that. One of the most important stories of Welsh heritage, and a favourite of mine, are the tales of the Mabinogi, a four-part story that involves magical afterlives, proud kings and monsters like giants, fairies and dragons. Some scholars believe that prior to Britain&#39;s Christianisation, the characters in the stories were considered gods.

Mixed with a sense of pride and admiration, I decided to try and write something both close to my heritage and something that could provide influential material to the wiki. Who knows, maybe I&#39;ll continue this story in the future.

This came to me after looking into [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-023 SCP-023] and how the UK appears to be obsessed with ghost doggies.

My first contest entry ever, this was done for [[[goblincon|Goblin Con]]] for the 6467 entry (Fantasy Goblin). I wanted to do something a little different than what was obvious, and I took inspiration from the myth of the changelings. I had also just finished DC vs. Vampires and Torchwood, so I also took inspiration from the concept of sleeper agents. Adding in some 4000 lore and I was done. Am I proud of it? A little. In hindsight, I think I could&#39;ve done better.

I am a huge fan of the War On All Fronts Canon.

&gt; &#34;In the anomalous world, Akiva Radiation is also known as Divine Grace, Yǐncáng shéngzi and Sruth. Here, in The Foundation, we use the term Akiva Radiation or, in a rush, just Akiva. What is it? Putting it simply, it&#39;s a subatomic particle that gravitates towards and coalesces around matter with thaumaturgical capabilities or properties. Just like a moth to a flame.&#34;

Inspired by all the orientations and thing I&#39;ve read since I came here. Monologue is a fun way of telling a story I think, as it&#39;s kind of up to the listener/reader to figure out the reason of the goings on around the speaker. Allows for a great deal of creative room. Also, I like the works of Terry Pratchett and Joyce Grenfell, who&#39;d often write and perform using monologue. I also wanted to put my own spin on Akiva Radiation as - not to insult anyone - I find the way magic is written in 
some skips and tales to be a bit - overcomplicated.

&gt; And so, from that day onward, Idris was blessed with oneiric union with the Library, and would move through its halls and branches when he dreamt. Through the dreams, he went on to learn and craft, forging new methods in magic and horticulture and paving paths and gardens into the landscape.

Just a fun little go at a GoI piece, which of course, I based off of a real legend and place.

&gt; The creatures are believed to be sterile, although this claim has yet to be confirmed by observation. Whilst the creatures haven&#39;t been observed breeding, they are capable of performing a theurgic, xenogenetic metamorphosis, in which they endow their anomaly qualities into another individual. How this is achieved is not unknown and requires further research.

My attempt to create a new GOI format for the HMFSCP. Also based on the Irish myth of the Neamh-Mairbh, who are a kind of mixture of vampires and ghouls. I decided to add some Hy-Brasil and Second-Hytoth lore in there for fun. I&#39;m really proud of the styling of this article more than anything.

Shwmae.

Real me talking here. The real [[*user arthcymro]]. You can refer to me as Arth.

Been here since Nov 2020, but started making monsters and myths in 2022. ###304529|//**Note to newbies, start small.**//## You can thank **[*https://www.youtube.com/c/TheExploringSeries The Exploring Series]** for my presents here. What do I like to write about? Hmmmmm. Not really sure. I guess I prefer the lighter side of things. No world-ending abominations or metaphysical nonsense. I more about the history and the adventures, with maybe some tears shed here and there.

What do I do outside of this?
