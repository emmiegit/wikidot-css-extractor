**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6654 is contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber within Site-56. It is to be given amenities and regular human contact via a weekly psychological interview to ensure compliance and stability of containment. Researchers are not to mention SCP-6654&#39;s anomalous effects to it, as to prevent catastrophic breach of containment, instead treating any deviations from baseline reality as normal or expected.

Personnel are to avoid introducing SCP-6654 to new concepts, especially those relating to harmful stimuli, including injuries, diseases and toxins.

**Description:** SCP-6654 is a humanoid presenting as a man in his late 50s, invariably wearing a striped blue polo shirt. Since its containment in 1923, SCP-6654 has shown no signs of aging, and no deviations from the above appearance regardless of the Foundation&#39;s attempted interference. These facts are, presumably, a result of its primary anomalous effect.

SCP-6654 is a living, localized semiohazard[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]//&#34;A semiohazard, informally, is a fact of the universe that just shouldn&#39;t be true, but functionally is. They are inherently abstract and affect the way that we think and communicate about reality&#34;//
- Intro to Semiontology, by S. M. KATZ, ESQ.[[/span]]. SCP-6654 - and, by proxy, its surroundings - are only affected by reality it observes or believes to be true (which in turn, becomes reality). The limits of this ability are assumed to be infinite, but testing has not been carried out to prevent irreversible damage to consensus reality.

SCP-6654 has been described as &#39;forgetful&#39;, &#39;oblivious&#39; and &#39;obnoxious&#39; by personnel. It is apparently unaware of its abilities, possessing severe cognitive dissonance when questioned regarding its localized changes to reality. This is considered a benefit to the Foundation, as it prevents SCP-6654 from utilizing its abilities to great extent.

**Interviewer:** Dr Regino Hansen

**Hansen:** You didn&#39;t notice the... Earthquake that took down half the site this morning? That meant we couldn&#39;t deliver breakfast?

**Closing notes:** At first, the subject refused treatment, claiming &#34;it wasn&#39;t that bad&#34; and failing to understand concepts including broken bones, infections and doctors. Upon being introduced to such, SCP-6654 manifested a broken wrist, and severe bruising down one side of its body. Following treatment, these healed in a manner expected of non-anomalous injuries.
