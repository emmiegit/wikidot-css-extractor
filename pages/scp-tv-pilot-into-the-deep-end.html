                                   VOICEOVER
                         We will bring them forth, with
                         blood and pestilence and fury. It
                         cannot be stopped. It is only a
                         matter of time.

                                                                CUT TO:
[[/&gt;]]

               EXT. BIG RIG ON A US HIGHWAY

               ANGLE ON big rig heading down a US highway at dawn. We hear a
               tinny radio version of &#34;Fast Freight&#34; by The Kingston Trio.

[[&gt;]]
                                                                CUT TO:
[[/&gt;]]


               INT. CAB OF BIG RIG

               CLOSE SHOT on cab radio, then ANGLE ON DRIVER listening to
               music. (S)he notices something in the distance, and as we
               cut, the music becomes higher fidelity.

[[&gt;]]
                                                                CUT TO:
[[/&gt;]]


               EXT. POV FROM CAB

               We see a sign for a weigh station, whose light switches from
               &#34;Closed&#34; to &#34;Open.&#34; Below the main sign is another reading:
               &#34;Mile sponsored by: Society for Cetacean Protection&#34;.

[[&gt;]]
                                                                CUT TO:
[[/&gt;]]


               INT. CAB OF BIG RIG

               Driver is noticeably perturbed. (S)he starts to turn the
               truck into the weigh station, as we...

[[&gt;]]
                                                                CUT TO:
[[/&gt;]]


               EXT. WEIGH STATION

               WIDE SHOT of truck pulling in as an ATTENDANT waves the truck
               into a lane near a series of bays.
               The truck comes to a stop timed with the end of the musical
               phrase &#34;If you go, you can&#39;t come back,&#34; around 1:15. Radio
               ends here (series background music may commence here).

               WIDE SHOT of Attendant near cab driver door. Door opens, then
               ANGLE ON each speaker in turn. Driver does not leave cab. 

[[=]]
                                   DRIVER
                         What the hell?

                                   ATTENDANT
                         New state regs. Random survey crap.
                         15 minutes, 20 tops. Over here.
[[/=]]

               WIDE SHOT as Attendant points towards one of the bays. Driver
               closes door and maneuvers the big rig into the bay, which
               Attendant accompanies and SHOT FOLLOWS. CLOSE IN on door as
               it opens, driver exits cab, ANGLE ON each speaker in turn.

[[=]]
                                   DRIVER
                         Anywhere to get a cup of coffee at
                         least? Long way to Fall River.

                                   ATTENDANT
                         (takes notice, then smiling) Sure,
                         I can put on a fresh pot. This way.
[[/=]]

               WIDE SHOT as the two exit the bay heading towards the weigh
               station office, with SHOT remaining centered on the bay.
               CLOSE IN on Attendant&#39;s hand pushing a button on a device on
               his/er belt. Resume WIDE SHOT as they leave the area, as we
               see the bay doors closing, and the truck descending into the
               bay floor.

[[&gt;]]
                                                                CUT TO:
[[/&gt;]]


               INT. TRUCK IN BAY

               OVERHEAD SHOT of truck descending down a large shaft.

[[&gt;]]
                                                                CUT TO:
[[/&gt;]]


               INT. FOUNDATION SITE-76 LOADING BAY

               WIDE SHOT on a large industrial loading bay in Foundation
               Site-76, as the truck descends onto a loading pad. We see
               numerous personnel in various states of work. As the truck
               reaches the bottom, several Foundation GUARDS in hardshell
               carapace armor, armed with automatic rifles, converge towards
               the back of the trailer.

               CLOSE IN on the rear trailer door, as it springs open. We see
               a troop transport exit, rolling down a waiting ramp. SHOT
               FOLLOWS the transport as it maneuvers into a parking space,
               Guards following.

               ANGLE IN on transport door, surrounded by Guards. Door opens,
               and we see a succession of D-CLASS and Guards, alternating,
               exiting the transport. The D-Class (imprisoned Foundation
               test subjects) are garbed in orange jumpsuits and have a
               black bag completely enveloping their heads. Their hands are
               manacled behind their backs, and legs are also manacled but
               allow walking. One of the D-Class has black gloves covering
               their hands and wrists (GLOVED D-CLASS). The accompanying
               Guards are similarly equipped as their Site-76 counterparts.
               SHOT WIDENS as the Guards group the D-Class into rows. There
               are 12 D-Class in all, each with a Guard on their right.

               During this scene, the transport goes back to the truck and
               re-enters the cab. The cab rear door closes, and the truck
               ascends back up the shaft. This all happens in the
               background, suggesting a fast transfer, triggered by the
               Attendant above.

               Another group of 12 Guards from Site-76 joins the D-Class
               group, each Guard moving to the left of each D-Class. They
               now move forward, each pair of Guards ferrying their D-Class
               to a variety of holding cells, shown in a series of CUTS
               (groups splitting up at corridor junctions, marching down
               corridors, ferrying D-Class into cells). While this is
               happening, we hear the following over a site-wide intercom:

[[=]]
                                   INTERCOM
                         Alert. (CUT) Site-76 D-Class
                         Loading Protocol is in effect.
                         (CUT) Condition Yellow. (CUT) All
                         Foundation personnel not involved
                         in the Loading Protocol (CUT) are
                         asked to clear corridors until the
                         All Clear is sound. (CUT) Alert
                         (repeats as needed)
[[/=]]


               INT. OUTSIDE SITE-76 &#34;CELL&#34; DOOR

               At the final CUT, the two Guards ferrying the Gloved D-Class
               (OUTSIDE/INSIDE GUARD, corresponding to From Bus/From Site
               76) stop in front of an apparent cell door. CLOSE IN on
               Inside Guard applying key card to door mechanism, which
               clicks open. 

[[&gt;]]
                                                                CUT TO:
[[/&gt;]]


               INT. SITE-76 DECOMMISSIONED LAB

               ANGLE IN on inside of door as the Inside Guard, Gloved D
               Class, and Outside Guard enter in that order. Inside Guard
               continues in, but Outside Guard stops short with Gloved D
               Class and expresses surprise.

               REVERSE ANGLE on Inside Guard, as we see what looks like a
               derelict lab (not a holding cell). He approaches a lab bench.
               Outside Guard begins speaking in this view, then immediately
               CUT BACK to ANGLE ON Outside Guard and Gloved D-Class.

[[=]]
                                   OUTSIDE GUARD
                         Hey, what&#39;s this? (CUT) Are you
                         sure this is the right-
[[/=]]

               Outside Guard is cut short by Gloved D-Class (still hooded),
               who swings its arms completely over its head as though its
               shoulders are on a ball joint, encircling Outside Guard&#39;s
               head and putting him/her into a chokehold with the manacles.
               CLOSE IN as Outside Guard struggles and loses consciousness.

               CUT BACK to Inside Guard, who places a small metal disk on
               the lab bench, as we hear (but do not see) the Outside
               Guard&#39;s body collapse and hit the floor. CLOSE IN on disk as
               Inside Guard touches the top, which causes the disk to glow
               deep blue and infuse the room with a dim blue hue.

               PROFILE SHOT as Inside Guard walks back to Gloved D-Class.
               Inside Guard bends over to undo the Gloved D-Class&#39; leg
               manacles and speaks in a hushed tone.

[[=]]
                                   INSIDE GUARD
                         The jammer shuts off in 60 seconds,
                         that&#39;s all we get.
[[/=]]

               CLOSE IN on Gloved D-Class&#39; hands. While Inside Guard keeps
               talking, Gloved D-Class squirms out of its arm manacles in an
               anomalous &amp; unsettling fashion, tossing them aside.

[[=]]
                                   INSIDE GUARD
                         I&#39;ve already logged you into your
                         cell, no one should notice.
[[/=]]

               WIDEN SHOT back to PROFILE. Inside Guard hands Gloved D-Class
               a key card.

[[=]]
                                   INSIDE GUARD
                         This gets you into the Keter Wing
                         and the containment cell. (more
                         slowly) Once you breach, you&#39;ll
                         have a minute at most. (faster)
                         That&#39;s it, I can&#39;t-
[[/=]]

               Gloved D-Class suddenly grabs Inside Guard&#39;s head and snaps
               his/her neck instantly, letting him/her fall to the ground.

               WIDE ANGLED SHOT of Gloved D-Class with dead bodies on either
               side of it. ANGLE IN on Gloved D-Class so that torso and
               hands are in view, then slowly PAN DOWN to hands as it
               removes and drops gloves. Hands are anomalous humanoid hands
               and are covered in tattoos. PAN UP as hands remove head bag.
               As the bag comes off, we CUT TO BLACK, then...



               INT. CORRIDOR TO KETER WING TWO

               BLACK DISSOLVES as a figure walks into corridor from front of
               camera (like uncovering the camera lens). We gradually see
               the back of a Guard (the Gloved D-Class in stolen armor)
               approaching a corridor arch guarded by two GUARDS. REVERSE
               ANGLE to show approaching Gloved D-Class in full Foundation
               armor, wearing sunglasses and a very blank expression. It
               holds the key card in its (Foundation gloved) hand, and
               continues walking forward.

               CLOSE IN on wall panel showing a blue Foundation trefoil (a
               circle in circle with three inward pointing arrows at equal
               angles around the circle). Hand with card moves into frame
               and touches panel turning the trefoil green and sounding an
               acknowledgement chime. PAN UP to the back of the Gloved D
               Class, who continues walking through the arch. SHOT WIDENS as
               Gloved D-Class continues its walk, showing Guards oblivious
               to anything unusual...

[[&gt;]]
                                                           CUT TO BLACK
[[/&gt;]]

=                                       ACT 1



               INT. SECURITY HALL FOUNDATION SITE-76

               HIGH SHOT of an enormous hall, with many types of personnel
               busily navigating the hall and adjacent corridors. The feel
               is one of a modern high-tech military research complex. We
               see the following text overlaid on the scene, in two lines:
               &#34;Foundation Site-76&#34;;&#34;Somewhere in the United States
               Midwest&#34;. In upper right corner of the shot we see 3 figures
               (among others) entering the scene, and we...

[[&gt;]]
                                                                CUT TO:
[[/&gt;]]

               WIDE SHOT of Foundation AGENT SIMON GREY, flanked by 2
               Foundation GUARDS, walking forward as the SHOT TRACKS BACK. 

               As we shall learn over the course of the series, the
               Foundation is a global clandestine organization dedicated to
               securing and containing anomalous objects, beings, and
               phenomena, thereby protecting humanity and the world at large
               against a breach of &#34;normalcy&#34; (defined by the Foundation).

               Agent Grey is a Containment Specialist and Junior Agent for
               the Foundation. He is 54, wearing an ill-fitting jacket and
               fedora, carrying a messenger bag. He is a lifer, and works at
               Site-19, the Foundation&#39;s largest containment site. He is
               short on formal education, which makes him unusual compared
               to most expert Foundation personnel. But Grey makes up for
               this with experience and a gut instinct about anomalies. He
               seems more comfortable with the anomalous world than most
               people. Both these facts put some distance between Grey and
               many of his colleagues.

               CLOSE IN on Grey&#39;s face, looking distracted.

[[&gt;]]
                                                                CUT TO:
[[/&gt;]]


               INT. AGENT KLIKS&#39; OFFICE SITE-76 (FLASHBACK)

               In a flashback, we see Agent Grey in the Site-76 office of
               AGENT THEO KLIKSOFAKUS (&#34;KLIKS&#34;). Flashbacks all have
               slightly hazy borders in the overall shot.

               Kliks is a Senior Field Agent for the Foundation. He is 36,
               and is nattily dressed in a tailored suit and expensive
               shoes. Under his jacket is a shimmering waistcoat tailored
               from Foundation ballistic chainmail. Kliks carries a
               concealed sidearm and blade. Kliks is sophisticated, well
               traveled, and cynical.
               He is well-connected to rival Groups of Interest, rendering
               his methods questionable even by Foundation standards.

               Kliks&#39; office is a mix of Euro taste and tackiness. Behind
               his chair is a grid of 9 computer monitors, with one a 3D
               heads-up display, currently showing a hideous lizard-like
               creature suspended in an aqueous medium, captioned SCP-682.
               His fixtures include both spare and ornate pieces which
               somehow seem to go together, just barely. Off in a corner, we
               see a small display of trophies, and if we could see the
               details, we would see various 2nd and 3rd place finishes (or
               lower) in chess, squash, bridge, golf, and the like.

               OVER THE SHOULDER SHOT of Grey sitting across Kliks&#39;
               conference table, looking at the table&#39;s embedded Foundation
               data station. We will see this object frequently: a monitor
               and flush keyboard, with a glass panel to the left of the
               keyboard. On the monitor we see the headshot of a young
               woman, with underlying text reading: &#34;Mahto, Jagruti (JR
               Cand.)&#34;, plus other surrounding text in much smaller font.
               Grey pushes away from the table and stands. WIDE SHOT of Grey
               standing and Kliks sitting in his chair, feet up on the
               table, not looking up from his phone. 

[[=]]
                                   GREY
                         Dr. Soren, sure. Mahto...I dunno.
                         Not seeing it, Kliks.
[[/=]]

               ANGLE ON Kliks, still not looking up.

[[=]]
                                   KLIKS
                         Not very woke, Special Agent. White
                         boy over the brown girl... 
[[/=]]

               ANGLE ON Grey, who furiously gazes at Kliks. ANGLE ON Kliks,
               who now looks up, and alternate in turn.

[[=]]
                                   KLIKS
                         Relax. Mahto&#39;s university advisors
                         were the same as you, Grey. All to
                         the Foundation&#39;s benefit.

                                   GREY
                         (disgusted) Your slimy insinuations
                         aside, isn&#39;t 10 years a long time
                         to get a PhD?

                                   KLIKS
                         (unfazed) Exactly why we want her.
                         She has skills beyond that one
                         degree. Another &#34;disappointment&#34;
                         that the Foundation recruits with
                         none the wiser.

                                   GREY
                         (resigned) OK, OK, Kliks. Just tell
                         me when they&#39;re ready for the talk.

                                   KLIKS
                         Two weeks, mark me. They&#39;ll love it
                         here.
[[/=]]

               Kliks reaches into a desk drawer and draws out an object.
               CLOSE IN as he brings the object to the table top. It is a
               metal disk identical to the communications jammer used by the
               traitorous Inside Guard. He touches the top and the blue glow
               infuses the room. ANGLE ON Kliks as he speaks to Grey.

[[=]]
                                   KLIKS
                         And now, on to the next order of
                         business...
[[/=]]

               ANGLE IN and then PAN IN CLOSE on Grey looking uncomfortable.

[[&gt;]]
                                                                CUT TO:
[[/&gt;]]


               INT. SECURITY HALL SITE-76

               CLOSE IN on Grey (matching prior flashback scene) as he
               continues walking with Guards. REVERSE WIDE ANGLE as the
               group approaches the main security desk.



               INT. SECURITY DESK SITE-76

               WIDE SHOT of the desk, staffed by 4 receptionists interacting
               with various Foundation personnel. Grey&#39;s group reaches the
               desk. LOW SHOT looking up at Grey retrieving his phone, then
               OVER THE SHOULDER SHOT as Grey touches his phone to the glass
               panel of a desk data station. CLOSE IN on data station
               monitor as it shows a headshot of Grey, with the text &#34;Agent
               Grey, Simon, Site-19&#34; below, and a Foundation trefoil
               switching from blue to green. ANGLE ON the nearest
               RECEPTIONIST.

[[=]]
                                   RECEPTIONIST
                         Welcome back to Site-76, Agent
                         Grey.
[[/=]]

               ANGLE IN on Grey, and we then flash back to...



               INT. AGENT GREY&#39;S OFFICE SITE-19 (FLASHBACK)

               Grey&#39;s office is the antithesis of Kliks&#39; office. It is
               spare, messy, piled with papers and files, and reflects
               someone who is rarely there and does not care.

               First ANGLE IN on Grey looking down, then WIDE SHOT of Grey
               packing his messenger bag with some papers and personal
               items. His desk computer terminal (the only object on his
               desk apart from stacks of papers, and he has no conference
               table) sounds a notification, and he turns to address it.

               OVER THE SHOULDER SHOT of Grey answering the call. His
               monitor shows a live feed of COMMANDER YOO YOON-HEE (CMDR
               YOO), headshot only. Below the headshot is the text: &#34;Cmdr.
               Yoo, Yoon-Hee, Site-76&#34;.

               Cmdr Yoo is 47 and is Chief of Security for Site-76. Starting
               from the bottom, she has only accepted promotion as long as
               she could stay &#34;in the action,&#34; and routinely leads the fight
               alongside her troops. She is brave to the point of
               foolhardiness, much to the consternation of her superiors.
               But as a result, she inspires great loyalty in her troops.
               She is simultaneously charismatic and enigmatic, a source of
               much knowledge that goes nowhere.

               We see various Guard activity behind Cmdr Yoo, suggesting she
               is at work making this call.

               ANGLE IN on Cmdr Yoo and Grey in turn.

[[=]]
                                   CMDR YOO
                         Hello Agent Grey.

                                   GREY
                         (surprised) Commander! I&#39;m, I&#39;m
                         fine, but...why the call?

                                   CMDR YOO
                         (formally) We look forward to
                         seeing you as usual when you pick
                         up our new Junior Researchers.

                                   GREY
                         Oh. I was just going to pick them
                         up early tomorrow and go. Isn&#39;t our
                         scheduled teleconference next week?

                         (insistent) Whatever your plans,

                         depart. Please contact me.

                                   GREY
                         (subdued) Of course, Commander. Is
                         there anything I should know?

                                   CMDR YOO
                         Just make sure to contact me before
                         you leave. And safe travels, Agent.

               Monitor restores to its neutral state, and we pan back to
               CLOSE IN on a confused Grey, and then...



               INT. SECURITY DESK SITE-76

               CLOSE IN on Grey back at the security desk. ANGLE IN on
               Receptionist, then Grey.

                                   RECEPTIONIST
                         Drs. Soren and Mahto are waiting

                         Agent Grey?

                         (noticing) Ah, thank you. Guards,

               WIDE SHOT FROM REAR as Grey and Guards head towards one of

                                                                CUT TO:
[[/&gt;]]


               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM 23

               Room is small and sterile with a table, a few chairs, and a
               few fixtures for running meetings. The desk contains a
               standard Foundation data station. On the wall is a
               touchscreen, with a predominant red eye optical interface.
               This screen displays the Foundation trefoil in blue along
               with some text. We see four travel bags against the wall.

               ANGLE ON door opening. Grey enters holding a Foundation
               touchpad, with GUARD #1 holding door, then closing it behind
               Grey.

[[=]]
                                   GREY
                         (to room) Doctors? I&#39;m Agent Simon
                         Grey, from Site-19.
[[/=]]

               Shot CUTS TO DR. NILS SOREN and DR. JAGRUTI MAHTO, standing
               behind the table.

               Dr. Soren is 29, a surgeon and biochemist of great promise.
               His residency completed, he had a pick of plum surgical
               posts, but has been recruited to join the Foundation&#39;s
               Xenobiology Division, with the goal of advancing anomalous
               autopsy and exploratory surgery. He has had several meetings
               with the Foundation and is confident as to what he is signing
               on for. He had the steadiest hands and most precise technique
               of his class. He is wearing a conservative bespoke suit.

               Dr. Mahto is 26, fresh out of university after 10 years,
               having entered as an age 16 prodigy. She is wearing a
               Foundation issue lab coat (black trefoil on the left breast),
               covering a colorful shalwar kameez. Dr. Mahto is a brilliant
               researcher and scientist across multiple disciplines, but has
               only recently been recruited to the Foundation and does not
               fully understand what she has signed on for.

               ANGLE ON Grey, Soren, and Mahto in turn. Grey approaches the
               table on the other side.

[[=]]
                                   DR. SOREN
                         Dr. Nils Soren, pleasure to meet
                         you, Agent Grey. (extends hand,
                         Grey shakes)

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         I also, Agent, but please, call me
                         Jagruti. (extends hand, Grey
                         shakes)

                                   GREY
                         (flatly) I call all researchers
                         Doctor. Easier that way.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         (assertive) Well, in that case,
                         Agent Grey, I would like to call
                         you Simon, if I may. I hate all
                         that macho surname bullshit.

                                   GREY
                         (grins) Fine with me, Doc, though
                         the Foundation IS a macho surname
                         kind of place. (beat) I blame the
                         O&#39;s.

                                   DR. SOREN 
                         (glances at Mahto) Doctor is fine
                         with me, Agent.

                                   GREY
                         I also! Please, sit.
[[/=]]

               They all sit at the table.

[[=]]
                                   DR. MAHTO 
                         Simon, (beat) Theo refers to you as
                         &#34;Special&#34; Agent Grey. Why is that? 

                                   GREY
                         (chuckling) Kliks, Agent Kliks.
                         Maybe his mum calls him Theo.
                         (looks down at pad) Anyway, it&#39;s a
                         joke, a dumb one at my expense.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         (flatly) I see. (Dr. Soren looks
                         bemused)

                                   GREY
                         (looks up one more item on
                         touchpad, then settles in) OK.
                         (beat) I&#39;m here to make sure you&#39;re
                         both making the right decision.
                         Frankly, the Foundation is a roach
                         motel: once you join, it&#39;s hard to
                         get out. And the amnestics are
                         unpleasant if you do get out.
[[/=]]

               CUT TO Soren and Mahto glancing at one another with
               trepidation, then back to Grey

[[=]]
                                   GREY
                         So I have just one question for
                         you, same one I have for all new
                         researchers: Why? Why the
                         Foundation? I mean, both of you
                         must have had other options.

                                   DR. SOREN
                         That&#39;s right, Agent. I still have a
                         position available at Mayo if I
                         want it. But I&#39;ve always wanted to
                         be the first, and the opportunity
                         to pioneer anomalous surgical
                         techniques is hard to pass up.
                         (glances at Mahto) And, the
                         Foundation tells me they have some
                         great perks.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         (pause) This is not so true for me,
                         Simon. The usual academic positions
                         I would pursue require that I
                         specialize. Publish or perish. My
                         Foundation recruiter said that I
                         would be able to pursue all of my
                         areas of interest. That the
                         Foundation has ongoing research in
                         both Hyperdimensional Quantum
                         Mechanics AND Computational
                         Linguistics is a dream come true.

                                   GREY
                         Ah, yeah. I can imagine. (he cannot
                         imagine) But it&#39;s all in the
                         service of the Foundation. You both
                         get that, right?
[[/=]]

               Mahto starts to answer, but Soren interrupts.

[[=]]
                                   DR. SOREN 
                         Yes, of course, Agent. We&#39;re
                         securing and containing anomalous
                         phenomenon. Our research should
                         further that effort and aid in the
                         protection of humanity.

                                   GREY
                         (pause, suddenly distracted) Right,
                         but are you sure you get what that
                         means? (beat, pained) The anomalous
                         world is not just some book of
                         monsters and magic items from a
                         role-playing game. (beat, wincing) 
[[/=]]

               Soren and Mahto notice Grey&#39;s distress.

                                   GREY
                         It&#39;s...much weirder than that. You
                         need to- (stops from the pain)
[[/=]]

               A loud klaxon sounds. CLOSE SHOT on wall touchscreen that is
               now flashing red, and the words &#34;Containment Breach&#34; surround
               the trefoil. Inside the center of the trefoil is a letter K,
               indicating that the breach is a Keter class anomaly, the most
               severe class, above both Safe and Euclid (medium risk). A
               Keter breach is both rare and extremely dangerous.

               WIDE SHOT of Grey, Soren, and Mahto reacting.

[[=]]
                                   GREY
                         (snapping to, no more pain)
                         Containment breach...a Keter!

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         Keter? (stands) Are we in danger?

                                   DR. SOREN
                         (stands, intrigued) A Keter class
                         anomaly is breaching containment?

                                   GREY
                         (stands) Don&#39;t know. (thinking)
                         God, what&#39;s Keter in this place?
                         (to Soren and Mahto) We have to get
                         you both to a safe room.

                                   GREY
                         What? Why, what breached?

                                   GUARD #2
                         SCP-140, sir, Keter Wing 2. (NOTE:

                                   GUARD #2
                         I don&#39;t even know what it is, sir,
                         just need to get you there.

                                   GREY
                         (wipes brow) OK, one of you must

               INT. NEAR SCP-140 CONTAINMENT CELL

               MOVING SHOT of Grey, Soren, Mahto, and Guards approaching.
               They then stop short. REVERSE ANGLE shows 2 Guards positioned
               around a containment cell door to the left. Two Guards are
               prone on the floor nearby, apparently dead. In front of door,
               but with some space, Kliks and Cmdr Yoo are flanked by 4
               Guards.

               Cmdr Yoo wears a Foundation ballistic martial arts suit,
               similar to a ninja&#39;s garment. She is armed with a holstered
               machine pistol, a long blade strapped to her leg, and a short
               riot baton dangling from her belt. Kliks wears a different
               suit from the flashback but is otherwise similarly attired.

               group enter the room with the other Guards. Grey&#39;s group is,
               from left to right, Mahto, Grey, Guard, and Soren.

               ANGLE ON Cmdr Yoo as she removes her riot stick from her
               belt, which immediately extends to a full jo stick. Cmdr Yoo
               twirls the jo stick in her hands, suggesting great expertise.

               GUARD #3 prepares to bypass the lock. To the right of door is
               another touchscreen, but this one is more elaborate as is
               required for Keter containment. Guard #3 is working this set

=                                       ACT 2



               INT. CONTAINMENT CELL OF SCP-140

               ANGLE ON the inside of the cell through the door. The
               anomalous humanoid holding the curved knife, our former
               Gloved D-Class, is a SARKITE, a member of the Sarkic Cults,
               one of many Groups of Interest (GoI) that compete/cooperate
               with the Foundation as they navigate the anomalous world. The
               Sarkic Cults are characterized by worship of power over
               ethics, and strength through adversity, amongst other,
               stranger things.

               The Sarkite is of ambiguous sex, wears minimal clothing, and
               is covered in tattoos. It also appears to have several
               pustules and lesions, as Sarkites venerate disease. It is
               this Sarkite that caused the breach of SCP-140. It may be
               possible to see the Sarkite&#39;s discarded armor, as well as a
               mask resembling a mannequin&#39;s face, on the floor.

               Almost immediately, the Sarkite crouches and then leaps out
               of the chamber in the manner of a large cat.



               INT. OUTSIDE CONTAINMENT CELL OF SCP-140

               CUT TO CMDR YOO, who collapses her jo stick back to a baton.
               SHOT TRACKS as she then executes a cartwheel and backflip
               towards the Sarkite so as to leap facing up.

               SLOW MOTION PROFILE SHOT of the Sarkite hovering face down
               over Cmdr Yoo mid-air, with Cmdr Yoo facing up. Cmdr Yoo
               extends her jo stick again, and twists her body to bring it
               in contact with the Sarkite&#39;s knife just before it strikes
               her.

               SHOT TO REALTIME FOLLOWING as the knife hurls towards KLIKS,
               who catches the knife and guides it into the wall. CUT BACK
               to Sarkite and Cmdr Yoo, who each land on their feet, but
               interchanged relative to their starting positions.

               ANGLE ON Sarkite who leaps into the air again. CUT TO Dr.
               Soren, as the Sarkite lands behind him. Sarkite reaches
               across Soren&#39;s chest with left arm and grabs Soren&#39;s upper
               right arm with its right hand. As the Sarkite hisses in
               Soren&#39;s face, it breaks Soren&#39;s arm viciously, as a jagged
               bone pierces the skin just below Soren&#39;s right shoulder.
               CLOSE SHOT of blood oozing from the wound and falling to the
               floor.

               Soren screams in pain and terror. Mahto lets out a brief
               shriek but maintains her composure better than Soren.
               Grey instinctively pushes Mahto away from the Sarkite. Quick
               CUT TO Kliks, then Cmdr Yoo reacting with great concern.
               ANGLE ON Cmdr Yoo, as she begins running towards Soren and
               the Sarkite.

                         Code Triad! I&#39;ll get him out!

               FAST CUT TO Kliks as he reaches into his breast pocket.

               TRACKING SHOT as Cmdr Yoo leaps at Soren, literally forcing
               him out of the Sarkite&#39;s grasp as they both tumble to the
               floor some meters away. The attending Guard sprints towards
               them. Soren shrieks even louder. Cmdr Yoo continues to move
               Soren further down the hall, helped by Guard.

               The knocked-down Sarkite quickly recovers. ANGLE ON 3 Guards
               converging on Sarkite, who simultaneously fire Tasers at the
               Sarkite. ANGLE ON Sarkite experiencing some pain, but not
               enough to incapacitate it. Sarkite grabs one of the Taser
               lines and pulls the Guard in. Once Guard is close enough, the
               Sarkite snaps his neck.

               ANGLE ON Grey and Mahto huddling in a corner, then CLOSE IN
               on Mahto as she notices something. CUT TO spot on floor where
               Soren&#39;s blood fell, as we see it vaporize rapidly, seemingly
               wafting towards SCP-140&#39;s containment cell. CUT BACK TO Grey
               and Mahto observing in bewilderment. Grey is frustrated. 

[[=]]
                                   GREY
                         God dammit!
[[/=]]

               ANGLE ON 2 more Guards who converge on Sarkite and Taser it.
               Sarkite is weakening but still active. CLOSE IN on Kliks, who
               is now wearing a compact face mask, and converges on the
               Sarkite.

               Sarkite sees Kliks and staggers to its feet, as the Guards
               attempt to keep their feet with varying degrees of success.
               Sarkite lunges at Kliks, but Kliks is ready. Kliks spins
               around and leg sweeps the Sarkite, sending it sprawling.
               Kliks becomes entangled in the Taser lines, and is just
               barely able to activate the tranquilizer grenade he throws in
               the Sarkite&#39;s face. Sarkite falls unconscious, but Kliks is
               still entangled. Two of the Guards fall unconscious from the
               grenade.

               ANGLE ON Grey as he assesses the situation, then ANGLE ON
               main area as Grey and other Guards free Guards and Kliks from
               the Taser lines, turning them off and dispersing gas in the
               process. One of the Guards that fell unconscious is dead from
               head trauma. Kliks looks up at Grey ambiguously.

               midst of the activity, nursing her left arm, ZOOM IN as she
               speaks.

               Cmdr Yoo leaves with 2 Guards. After a moment, the klaxon
               ceases in the immediate area, though it is still heard off in

               Four Guards heave the unconscious Sarkite to its feet, two
               each grabbing arms/legs.
               Kliks picks up one of the Sarkite&#39;s hands (CLOSE SHOT), and
               notices a long knife cut across the palm which is already in
               the early stages of forming a scar. He glances back at the
               knife in the wall (CLOSE SHOT) and we see no trace of blood.
               Where did the blood go?

               Kliks removes a small metal cylinder from his breast pocket
               (CLOSE SHOT), and (OVER SHOULDER) uses it to spray something
               in the Sarkite&#39;s face. The Sarkite immediately comes to,
               coughing and sputtering, and still weak. The Guards
               straighten up the Sarkite as Kliks moves closer. ANGLE ON

                         You couldn&#39;t remake my bed. (beat)
                         Why do you even want them here?
                         They&#39;d exterminate you without a

                                   SARKITE
                         They&#39;re a worthy enemy. The battles
                         would be epic. Unlike you pathetic
                         weaklings. That world is preferred
                         to this one.

                         You mean the pathetic weaklings who
                         just owned you? Who else is here?

                         Fourteen to one. (sarcastic) I&#39;m SO
                         impressed by you healthy ones. And
                         we have what we wanted. You know
                         you will get nothing from me.

                                   KLIKS
                         Not now, perhaps. But it&#39;s another
                         story once the Church of the Broken
                         God sinks their hooks into you.
                         (menacing) I can&#39;t wait to make

                         Keter SCP?

                                   GREY
                         What? No, the Sarkite caused the
                         breach. 140 is in that cell.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         (confused) But why would it want to
                         free the SCP? Aren&#39;t we protecting
                         humanity by containing SCPs?

                                   GREY

                                   GREY
                         (disbelieving) You need? I don&#39;t
                         work here, Kliks. Where&#39;s Dr.
                         Killman, or the junior on 140?

                                   KLIKS
                         (pause) Both Killman and Rodriguez
                         are offsite today. (snide) And once
                         again, you show up as the backup on
                         yet another &#34;skip&#34; you shouldn&#39;t be
                         anywhere near. You&#39;re top of the
                         roster. It&#39;s the only reason I&#39;m
                         asking.

                                   GREY
                         BOTH of them are away? Kliks...

                                   KLIKS
                         (angrily) Yes, it&#39;s sabotage, I
                         know! That&#39;s why I have to start
                         making calls.

                                   GREY
                         This is your fault, isn&#39;t it! You-

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         (before Kliks can respond) Stop it!
                         Both of you. Clearly there is work
                         to be done.

                         Of course I can, it&#39;s you who

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         But I do. It&#39;s retrocausality: as
                         the book is rewritten, history
                         follows suit, and the Daevas live
                         for longer as their failures are re

                                   GREY

                         unfathomable impact on humanity?

                                   GREY
                         (serious, slowly) Doctor, nothing
                         is worse than an LV, a Lifted Veil
                         scenario. The world can&#39;t function
                         unless the Foundation remains a
                         secret. You have to accept that if
                         you want to work here.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         (long pause) My God. The nihilism,
                         Simon. The lies. The deception.
                         I had no idea what the Foundation
                         was doing, and they and you were
                         concealing everything.

                                   GREY
                         Doctor, no. Someday, you might
                         figure out why the expansions
                         happen. Maybe you&#39;ll figure out how
                         to stop them entirely.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         (unbelieving) What? How, Simon?

                                   GREY
                         (pause) Beats me, Doc. I don&#39;t
                         understand your work. But I know
                         it&#39;s why you&#39;re here. Why we&#39;re all
                         here. (long pause) There&#39;s one
                         other thing about this breach
                         that&#39;s not done.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         (weary) What is that?

                         When the Daevas live for longer,
                         they leave behind more artifacts.
                         Graves. The Foundation has
                         archeologists onsite at Daeva digs.
                         Yesterday, those sites were dug up,
                         empty. But today, the Daevas have
                         lived for longer. And so the
                         Foundation needs to look at those
                         sites again. And when they do...

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         Oh my Lord, Simon, you mean a
                         complete rewrite of those sites?

                                   GREY
                         And don&#39;t forget: thaumaturgy!
                         Cannibalism! You can&#39;t just start

               EXT. FOUNDATION ARCHEOLOGICAL SITE, SOMEWHERE IN NORTHERN
               PAKISTAN--DUSK

               The entirety of this act is shot with a handheld camera.

               SHOT on an expansive, modern archeological site. The site is
               peopled with workers, guards, and researchers. As it is
               evening, activity is light. A few vehicles are seen entering
               and leaving. The land is both mountainous and green. The site
               itself is near the bottom of a valley with a small lake.

               Screen shows two-line caption: &#34;Foundation Archeological
               Site&#34;; &#34;Somewhere in Northern Pakistan&#34;

               ANGLE ON Comm Operator as a red light flashes on his console.

               abruptly shuts off the console.

               Dr. Jafari gets up and hurriedly exits the tent. SHOT TRACKS

                                   CAPTAIN GOOD
                         Good evening, Ibrahim. It looks

                                   CAPTAIN GOOD
                         Those bloody Sarkites never stop,

                         Should be done in 10, sir.

                         Too slow, Captain. My Diggers will

                                   CAPTAIN GOOD
                         So quick? Don&#39;t you need more time
                         to prepare?

                                   MAJOR STANTON
                         This is a breach, Captain.
                         Threatens a CK. Got to seal up
                         these ugly sorcerers. (notices Dr.
                         Jafari) Why is this civilian still
                         here, Captain Good?

                                   DR. JAFARI
                         Major, I am the lead researcher
                         here. I would like to observe the
                         containment.

                                   MAJOR STANTON
                         Observe, Doctor? You have no idea.
                         Some of my Diggers are going to die
                         today. They know it, I know it. No
                         way we get out unscathed. Why will
                         you?

                                   DR. JAFARI
                         There is no guarantee that
                         something deadly happens this time.

                                   MAJOR STANTON
                         Then why stay, Doctor? Isn&#39;t that
                         what you want to see? Get a Keter
                         notch in your belt? Anyway, I don&#39;t
                         have the luxury to contemplate
                         that. More people will die if did.

                                   DR. JAFARI
                         (pause) I still need to try. To see
                         something living from the past, if
                         it happens...it is worth the risk.

                                   MAJOR STANTON
                         (disgusted, ironic) I guess that&#39;s
                         fine, Doctor. You can sit up front
                         in the troop transport with Jacobs.
                         That should give you a nice view.
                         We&#39;ll see how you fare. (to Good,

               FRONT SHOT of GREY, DR. MAHTO, and 2 GUARD escorts, slowly
               walking to the Security Desk. Grey has his messenger bag, and
               each Guard is carrying a travel bag belonging to Dr. Mahto.

[[=]]
                                   DR. MAHTO
                         (furious) It was all a lie, Simon.
                         This is nothing like what the
                         Foundation said I would be doing.

                                   GREY
                         I don&#39;t know what to tell you.
                         Today was extreme, but not
                         unexpected. Your orientation-

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         43 people died today! That&#39;s not
                         unexpected? That much daily death?

                                   GREY
                         Look, Zeta-9 knew the score. Mobile
                         Task Forces are our best, but that
                         means they get the tough jobs.
                         Sometimes they&#39;re impossible.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         How can you tolerate that, Simon?
                         It&#39;s...it&#39;s monstrous. Unthinkable.
[[/=]]

               CLOSE SHOT on Dr. Mahto

[[=]]
                                   DR. MAHTO
                         (sincere) I have always envisioned
                         my research helping people, serving
                         humanity. But now I realize I&#39;ve
                         signed on to just holding back
                         cosmic monsters and keeping the
                         body count to a minimum!
[[/=]]

               WIDEN SHOT to Group. Grey stops and turns to Dr. Mahto, then
               to the Guards.

[[=]]
                                   GREY
                         Guards, give us a moment.
[[/=]]

               The Guards step to the side. FRONT SHOT on Grey and Dr. Mahto
               in PROFILE.

[[=]]
                                   GREY
                         Doctor. (pause) Jagruti. Today,
                         (pause) today you saw more than
                         most new researchers see in 3
                         years. It&#39;s awful on the best days.
                         You just saw the worst. But that&#39;s
                         it, you have to stop feeling sorry
                         for yourself and get on with it.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         (furious) How dare you, Simon! I am
                         not feeling sorry for myself! The
                         Foundation lied to me. I was
                         tricked into making the wrong
                         decision.

                                   GREY
                         (thinking) I guess that old saying
                         is right, then.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         What old saying?

                                   GREY
                         The truth hurts.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         (exasperated) How does that even
                         apply here, Simon?

                                   GREY
                         I don&#39;t know! (pause) I&#39;m just...
                         (long pause) You saw the truth,
                         Doctor. More than most people ever
                         will. And yeah, most people don&#39;t
                         want the truth, because it hurts to
                         know. (pause) But you&#39;re a
                         scientist. I mean, I&#39;m not one, but
                         I thought that the truth was
                         everything to scientists. When you
                         do an experiment, or whatever, do
                         you give up if it doesn&#39;t work the
                         way you wanted?

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         (disarmed) No, not if you are a
                         good scientist. Sometimes, the
                         failures provide the most
                         information.

                                   GREY
                         Then you&#39;re in the right place,
                         Doctor. Lotta failure here.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         But how do I get past all the
                         deception, Simon? How do I ever
                         trust the Foundation again?

                                   GREY
                         (beat) You don&#39;t. Ever. You just
                         get used to it. You figure out how
                         to contribute while maintaining
                         whatever morals you think you have.
                         Your first meeting with the Ethics
                         Committee will clarify a lot.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         (beat) And that&#39;s it?

                                   GREY
                         (long pause) That&#39;s it.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         (long pause) I see. (beat, change
                         in demeaner) Well, I do think that
                         I trust YOU, Simon. Maybe that&#39;s
                         enough for me to continue.

                                   GREY
                         (stunned) I hope so, Jagruti.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         So back to your proposal. (beat) If
                         I could figure out the mechanism
                         for SCP-140 expansion, it would be
                         more meaningful than anything I
                         have worked on to date.

                                   GREY
                         Yes, it would.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         140 seems able to convert a certain
                         form of matter to retrocausal
                         energy. If we could monitor local
                         quantum entanglement during an
                         expansion event- 

                                   GREY
                         Doctor-

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         -we could measure the changes in
                         entanglement correlation, and see
                         how it applies to the local quantum
                         field! Then-

                                   GREY
                         DOCTOR. I. Have. No. Idea what
                         you&#39;re talking about. (beat) But
                         it&#39;s good you do. Let&#39;s get to Site
                         19. Look up Dr. Xyanks when you get
                         there. (to Guards) Guards, we&#39;re
                         ready.
[[/=]]

               REVERSE SHOT as Grey, Mahto, and Guard walk away, continuing
               towards the Security Desk. Mahto continues to formulate,
               while Grey just nods.

[[&gt;]]
                                                                CUT TO:
[[/&gt;]]


               INT. SECURITY DESK SITE-76

               ANGLE ON Grey and Mahto as they come up behind main desk and
               stop short. Camera continues forward to reveal a large
               contingent of Guards, researchers, and staff milling about
               and talking to each other. CMDR YOO and LT. QUINN seem to be
               a particular focus of attention, while Agent Kliks stand near
               the desk, observing the proceedings. The mood is festive.
               Cmdr Yoo&#39;s left forearm has a cast with many signatures and
               doodles.

[[=]]
                                   GREY
                         Geezus, did we miss something?

                                   KLIKS
                         In fact, you missed several
                         somethings.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         Oh, I&#39;m sorry we missed it! Some
                         good news is welcome.

                                   GREY
                         What? What happened?
[[/=]]

               ANGLE ON Cmdr Yoo and Lt. Quinn approaching.

[[=]]
                                   KLIKS
                         Special Agent, you are now speaking
                         to Captain Jesse Quinn. Show some
                         respect.

                                   GREY
                         Wow, that&#39;s great news, ah,
                         Captain.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         Jesse, I am so proud of you. I wish
                         we had more time to work together.

                                   CAPTAIN QUINN
                         Thanks, Doctor. But I can tell,
                         you&#39;re needed at Site-19. I&#39;ll hold
                         down the fort here.

                                   GREY
                         Hold down the--

                                   CMDR YOO
                         Captain Quinn is the new Chief of
                         Security for 76. (to Quinn, in
                         jest) Don&#39;t botch this, Jess. I&#39;ll
                         have lots of eyes watching you.

                                   GREY
                         (realizing) OK, catching up slowly.
                         Does that mean (smiles all about)
                         Commander, are you moving to Site
                         19? Yoon-hee, that&#39;s incredible!
                         (calmer) I mean, Commander.

                                   CMDR YOO
                         Yes, Agent Grey. As long as they
                         keep telling me it doesn&#39;t have to
                         be a desk job, I&#39;ll keep saying
                         yes. Plus, who&#39;s going to keep you
                         and Kliks from driving each other
                         to drink?

                                   GREY
                         (sickly) Oh, no, no really?

                                   KLIKS
                         The powers that be have come to
                         their senses, and are moving me to
                         my rightful domain. I&#39;ve been given
                         an &#34;at large&#34; portfolio: dabbling
                         in whatever I deem most important
                         across the entire grid. Don&#39;t
                         worry, Grey, I&#39;ll give you a taste
                         now and then.

                                   GREY
                         (looking at the group) Well, two
                         out of three isn&#39;t bad.

                                   CMDR YOO
                         If it&#39;s any consolation, Agent, we
                         get to take the jet back.

                                   GREY
                         Nice perk, Commander. Well, then, I
                         guess we&#39;re ready. Guard, please
                         arrange an escort and take
                         everyone&#39;s luggage.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         Simon, I want to say goodbye to a
                         few people here. It will just take
                         a moment.

                                   GREY
                         I think the jet has to wait for us.
[[/=]]

               Dr. Mahto steps into the crowd. Kliks moves closer to Grey
               and they have a quiet conversation.

[[=]]
                                   KLIKS
                         A quick chat, not in front of the
                         others.

                                   GREY
                         Well, Yoon-hee must know.

                                   KLIKS
                         No, the Commander has no official
                         knowledge. Remember that.

                                   GREY
                         (beat) Sure. So you have some new
                         insult you want to spring on me?

                                   KLIKS
                         In good time. But right now, I need
                         to apologize. Something did go
                         wrong with 140.

                                   GREY
                         Christ, Kliks, you think? A Top 20
                         Keter breached! What possible-

                                   KLIKS
                         It has to do with...our project.

                                   GREY
                         (silent, then) Like I said. How?

                                   KLIKS
                         Let&#39;s say that we may have an &#39;in&#39;
                         now with someone who knows...a Way.

                                   GREY
                         (pause) I don&#39;t know, Kliks. We&#39;ve
                         been lied to again and again. Seems
                         like you&#39;re moving too fast. And I
                         don&#39;t have any control.

                                   KLIKS
                         With us both at Site-19 it will be
                         easier to coordinate. And for you
                         to be more informed.

                                   GREY
                         (distressed) So this may have all
                         been worth it. All these deaths.
                         What the hell&#39;s wrong with me?

                                   KLIKS
                         The Foundation does it to us all.
                         Might as well put it to the best
                         possible use.
[[/=]]

               Dr. Mahto approaches with Cmdr Yoo and 3 Guard escorts. Also
               entering the scene is the PILOT taking our crew to Site-19.
               (S)he is a less armored guard, wearing a visored helmet
               obscuring his/er eyes. (S)he also wears gloves...similar to
               the Sarkite (recall none of our main cast saw this). PAN IN
               on the gloves. Then CUT TO WIDE SHOT on Dr. Mahto.

[[=]]
                                   DR. MAHTO
                         All right, Simon, I&#39;m ready.

                                   CMDR YOO
                         Do you know your first assignment,
                         Jagruti?

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         I am part of Dr. Gears&#39; research
                         group. I don&#39;t know much more than
                         that right now.

                                   GREY
                         (knowingly) Oh, man, Gears!

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         What does THAT mean?

                                   GREY
                         (pause) I can tell you some stories
                         on the plane.

                                   KLIKS
                         (acknowledging Pilot) Pilot, we&#39;re
                         ready to depart. Off to the
                         mothership, everyone!
[[/=]]

               Grey suddenly looks distracted, and is looking at the Pilot.
               The group begins to depart. Grey turns to Dr. Mahto.

[[=]]
                                   GREY
                         (distracted) Oh, almost forgot.
                         Never had a chance this morning.
[[/=]]

               Grey steps back and formally extends a hand to Dr. Mahto.

[[=]]
                                   GREY
                         (ambivalent, serious) Welcome to
                         the Foundation, Doctor.
[[/=]]

               Dr. Mahto shakes Grey&#39;s hand once. The group turns towards a
               corridor and heads towards it. Grey taps Kliks on the
               shoulder and says something unheard. Both briefly stop, look
               at the Pilot, then continue walking. SHOT PULLS BACK to show
               the entire hall as the group departs. SHOT DISSOLVES up to
               the weigh station bay, then WIDENS to show the whole weigh
               station. Continues to PULL BACK to show a construction dig
               next to the weigh station hidden from the highway. Across the
               screen we see the text &#34;Solaris Construction &amp; Planning.&#34; We
               hover over this scene as the text and scene begin to fade,
               apart from the leading letters &#34;S-C-P&#34;, as we...
