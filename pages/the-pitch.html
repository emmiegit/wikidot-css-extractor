Ah, hello, hello. Couldn&#39;t help but notice ya staring at me like that.  Let me guess, you&#39;re interested in what&#39;s in these vials? 

Really? Well I&#39;ll tell you anyway. I&#39;m an old man, got nothing to do but talk to myself. You&#39;ll understand it when you&#39;re older, eh? Anyway, you&#39;re not the first one to ask me about these vials.

I know you didn&#39;t! But I&#39;m going to pretend like ya did, cause I ain&#39;t got nothing else to do. Now shush up and listen. These here bottles got liquid science inside &#39;em.

Course it makes sense. Just watch. Lemme take just take out this one. Check that label out. &#39;Evolution&#39;. Bet ya can&#39;t guess what&#39;s in that one, eh? 

Tch. You don&#39;t got many friends at school do ya? 

Shush up I said! So as I was saying before I was so crudely interrupted, this bottles got evolution inside o&#39; it. This one&#39;s got the speed o&#39; light, this one&#39;s got Planck&#39;s constant... they teach you that in school yet? 

Tch. That&#39;s the government for ya. Anyway, all twenty-five o&#39; these little bottles got something different inside it. And when you got that thing&#39;s bottle, you can have all sorts of fun. Someone with all o&#39; these bottles, they&#39;d be basically God.

I&#39;m going to sell them, what the hell else would I do? 50 dollars a drop. That&#39;s a steal, don&#39;t try to think otherwise. 

You ain&#39;t convinced? Alright, alright. Lemme show you something. Say hi to Gregory. Don&#39;t worry, he don&#39;t bite. Gregory here is my sales partner. Can ya figure out what he is? 

Ha, no, he&#39;s a hamster. He used ta be at least, before he got a taste o&#39; this. Don&#39;t look at me at like that. Just watch. Only one drop o&#39; this stuff and he&#39;ll start to get real worked up, yes sir. 

Stop that! It&#39;s not hurting him. He probably just feels a bit o&#39; tickling. Look at that! Isn&#39;t beautiful? A million years o&#39; natural selection, all condensed into a few minutes. And that&#39;s just one drop. Think what ya could do with five, or ten. Could change a whole lotta animals couldn&#39;t ya? Maybe even try a bit on yourself, see what happens?

Hell no I aint! Do I look stupid? For all I know I&#39;ll end up with my eyes on my asshole or something. I just saying it&#39;s a possibility. 

What&#39;s that? Speak up!

All sorts a reason! Ain&#39;t you curious about what could happen? Ain&#39;t you ever wondered &#39;bout what the world we be like after you&#39;re gone?

How about practical reasons then? With one o&#39; these things, you could become a celebrity overnight. Scientists the world over would flip a pig over ol&#39; Gregory here. If you had two or three o&#39; things to how &#39;em, how do ya think they would react?

Okay, okay, that&#39;s fine. We&#39;ll just have to find something a bit up more your alley. Nuclear fusion? You&#39;d be the first kid I met who don&#39;t get a bit excited by the idea of mixing up his own elements.

Speed o&#39; light then? Gravity? Food chain?

Really? Most folks don&#39;t seem to like that one too much. What do ya plan on?

Hm. Sounds dangerous. You sure about it?

Fine fine. Just try not to do it while I&#39;m around, heh. For that, I&#39;d say you need... 20 drops? You happen to be carrying $1000 in those basketball shorts, kid?

Of course I don&#39;t! You pay now or not at all. 

Alright, come back then. I&#39;ll be waiting.</textarea></pre>
