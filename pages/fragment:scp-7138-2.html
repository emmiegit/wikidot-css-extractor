**Item #:** SCP-7138

**Object Class:** Pending

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7138 will be stored in a non-humanoid containment room ##red|lined with mirrors. Viewing SCP-7138 should be done through those mirrors. SCP-7138 will not be interacted with on Sundays or during the first week of the month.## Personnel viewing SCP-7138 directly are advised to ##red|wear rose-tinted glasses, unless you have brown eyes.## All interactions with SCP-7138 must be approved and supervised by Dr. Montgomery.

**Description:** SCP-7138 is a 1 square meter canvas covered in magenta paint of various shades. Subjects exposed to SCP-7138 report heightened anxiety and aversion to the color magenta. On at least one occasion, exposure to SCP-7138 has caused subjects to remove their optical organs. 
SCP-7138 does not emit any thaumic radiation, nor are its effects hampered by Scranton reality anchors. 

##red|The lack of any obvious anomalous aspects, combined with SCP-7138’s effects, suggests that there must be a deeper level on which SCP-7138 operates. We just can’t see past our reality to what’s underneath. We can’t see the true reality.##

##red|Since its discovery, SCP-7138 has remained quiet, but sooner or later we’ll wake it up. Sooner or later we’ll wring the truth from it.##

**Discovery:** SCP-7138 came to the Foundation’s attention during an investigation into the deaths of several suspected members of AWCY (designated subjects 7138-A through C) during a &#34;twenty-four-hour art contest&#34;. Interviews with 7138-C indicate that they may not have intended to create SCP-7138.

Monty,
I saw your most recent update to the SCP-7138 file, and I’m beginning to wonder if you might need a break. You’ve made a lot of progress, of course, but maybe it’s time to take a step back, let someone else take the helm. 

Only temporarily, of course. I’m sure after a short time you’ll be able to take over again and wrap up the project.

Sincerely,
Carl Blanden,
Director of Site ██

Carl,
Don’t give me that. You know that we’re no closer to figuring out SCP-7138 than when we started.  We have no idea what makes SCP-7138 tick, and until we do, there’s no guarantee that it won’t go off at any moment. It could be even worse the next time.

And I’m not taking a break either. I’m the best – heck, the only – expert on SCP-7138. I know there’s something here, and I’m going to find it. I will see the deeper reality.

There’s no way I can just walk away from this. I can’t even look at something magenta without thinking of that stupid painting and shuddering.

I’m in it till the end.

Sincerely,
Dr. Montgomery, 
PHD

[[collapsible hideLocation=&#34;both&#34; show=&#34;+ Incident 7138-1 &#34; hide=&#34;- Close Transcript&#34;]]
On 03/07/20██, site security was alerted to a disturbance in the anomaly research laboratory belonging to Dr. Montgomery. Attached is a transcript of the security footage taken from the incident.
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
[The laboratory is in disarray. Every monitor in the room has been smashed, and there is a pile of ash where something was burnt. SCP-7138 has been removed from its secure storage and subjected to severe laceration. Dr. Montgomery is present. He is crouched in the corner farthest from SCP-7138, his face turned toward the wall.]

[Security Officer Charles enters the room.]

**Security Officer Charles:** Dr. Monty? I heard there was some kind of ruckus happening. Do you need a hand?

[Security Officer Charles surveys the room.]

**Security Officer Charles:** [Speaking into his radio] I need backup down here. We might have some kind of breach. [Out load] Dr. Montgomery? Are you alright? 

[Dr. Montgomery is unresponsive. A soft whispering is audible.]

**Security Officer Charles:** Can you repeat that?

[The whispering continues, rising in volume.]

**Security Officer Charles:** Monty? Are you okay?

[Security Officer Charles touches Dr. Montgomery on the shoulder. Dr. Montgomery turns around. Security Officer Charles takes a rapid step back.]

**Security Officer Charles:** What the...

[Dr. Montgomery&#39;s face is heavily disfigured. Both eyes have been removed, and he is holding them in his hands. He continues speaking, now at a much louder volume.]

**Dr. Montgomery:** It&#39;s not real. It can&#39;t be real. I didn&#39;t see anything. The truth is a lie. What I saw was a dream.

**Security Officer Charles:** I... I need a medic in here!

**Dr. Montgomery:** It was all a dream. A simple dream. And then it became a nightmare. And now I&#39;m awake.
[[/div]]
Following this incident, Dr. Montgomery was reclassified as Subject 7138-E
