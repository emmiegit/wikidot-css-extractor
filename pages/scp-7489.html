**Foundation File #:** FF-7489

**Notice:** Uncontained

**Interest Type //(Subtype)//:** Gestalt //(Incorporeal)//

**Containment Protocols:** All efforts are to be made, within jurisdiction of the PCC Foundation[[footnote]]Post-Calamity Community Foundation[[/footnote]], to keep FF-7489 from reunifying.

In the event that Ap and Peri Helion must be brought into Foundation custody, they are to be placed in separate, Standard Fae Containment cells and enhanced SRAs[[footnote]]Scranton Reality Anchor, a device that keeps a local area&#39;s reality stable.[[/footnote]] are to be placed outside of their cells to reduce the effects of FF-7489-1. The locations of Ap and Peri Helion are unknown. If found, they are to be monitored at a safe distance.

Salem Glass is to be brought into Foundation custody and placed in High-Security Humanoid Containment. Lucky Cat shipmates are to be placed in appropriate humanoid containment. Lucky Cat was last located heading east into the California Sea.

Nova is being monitored by the Foundation; last known location is en route to Portland Shoals in the Oregonian Sea.

**Definition:** FF-7489 was the collective designation for Lucky Cat[[footnote]]Nautical based crime syndicate.[[/footnote]] and two members possessing an altered form of tychekinesis (designated FF-7489-1). It&#39;s unknown if these two members, Ap and Peri Helion, have control over their abilities. FF-7489-1 manipulates the probability of events in a way that favors Ap and Peri Helion, even if it leads to destruction. FF-7489-1 has led to a number of catastrophic events in the wake of Lucky Cat&#39;s crime streaks. Negative probabilistic events recorded include, blizzards, major power failures, and hurricanes[[footnote]]See Incident Report 7000.2[[/footnote]].

**Discovery:** On 2490/06/07 Bran, a Foundation sentry, arrived from a Foundation outpost in Low Brasil. He was the only member from his team to reach Site-XYZ. When admitted into the infirmary he was diagnosed with second degree frostbite, luxation to the left wrist, torn ligaments in the left wing and was severely malnourished.

Inspecting Bran&#39;s personal belongings revealed an image, and a report addressed to Site-XYZ&#39;s directors.

**Macky:** Why didn&#39;t you leave your post sooner to inform us?

**Bran:** We were tied in the basement of our outpost, and we don&#39;t have a radio.

**Macky:** How were you able to escape?

**Bran:** //(sharp intake of air through teeth)// I dislocated my wrist. And slipped out of the ropes.

**Macky:** I&#39;m sorry.

**Bran:** Don&#39;t be.

**Macky:** We found a letter on your person. I have a few questions about it.

//[Bran nods.]//

**Macky:** The letter claims that your town was hit by a blizzard.

**Bran:** I&#39;m aware. But the Foundation needs to be careful about the pirates, moreso than the weather patterns.

**Macky:** Why&#39;s that?

**Bran:** Rumors from the east claim Lucky Cat to be catastrophic if paths are crossed. Lucky Cat is what these pirates call themself. //(yawns)// I&#39;m sorry to cut this short, I&#39;m exhausted.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
2490/06/09

[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/unhuman-hub During my four-hundred years cryogenic slumber,] global warming had turned the entire US coast into the tropics and subtropics. The sea level rise turned the San Francisco Bay Area into archipelagos. Little Brasil is a sub tropical town. Experiencing a blizzard is an anomaly regardless of the Calamity and the Veil breaking. The locals said there hadn&#39;t been a blizzard in the Big Sur/Little Brasil area for one hundred years. An anomaly to an anomaly.

A cache of oil and scavenged electronics were stored at an outpost in San Mateo Beach. A day after Bran&#39;s report, Lucky Cat raided the outpost.

I&#39;m wondering if the party is moored in an alcove or a cave in the Neo Frisco area. Merced Island, Sunset Beach, Neo Frisco Sound, Sucrose and Richmond Atoll have all been informed to monitor for the syndicate.

The vantage point is from a ruined cell tower. The ship is docked and two security guards stand beside a ramp leading onto the ship.]

[Movement is detected in the houses. A figure sneaks out of the houses toward security. Another figure follows shortly after the first. The two figures crouch behind rusted automobiles.]

[A few minutes pass. The two figures sneak closer and jump the guards simultaneously. The figures are revealed to be Ap and Salem.]

[Foundation enforcements arrive and flank Salem and Ap. It&#39;s at this point the crew rush to untie the ship. The ship disembarks with no further issue.]

[Guards remove their rapiers. Salem removes her cutlass. She yells something,[[footnote]]On later playback and with the help of personnel who are proficient in reading lips, it&#39;s hypothesized that Salem yelled &#34;Engarde&#34;.[[/footnote]] and engages the guards.]

Lucky Cat was speculated to be in Neo Frisco Sound, south Neo Frisco, Portola Key and Merced Island. The Foundation alerted postal couriers in these areas to report any unusual parcel deliveries.

On 2490/06/14 a letter addressed to //Guiding Star// was delivered to the post office in west Merced Island. The Foundation made a decoy letter, and sent Agents Macky and Cinderella to investigate. Due to the nature of their cover, only audio was recorded.

Cindy,

I tried to tell that to both him and the Board. He believes it&#39;ll only be a &#34;little bit of rain&#34;.

Before the Calamity the Florida Sea used to be a peninsula. It&#39;d get hit every summer by a few hurricanes. I lived there for a few years and looking at the reports, it&#39;s possible this depression will turn into a //category 4// hurricane. We //should// be evacuating the Greater Frisco area.

[Perspective is from a camera mounted at the peak of Sucrose Ruins. It&#39;s pointed down to the forest at the base and the front of Site-XYZ is in the corner frame. A crowd is gathered.]

[Movement is detected in the forest below. Peri and Ap emerge. Ap scales the scaffolding. Peri keeps watch at the base.]

[City-Head Jesse Waterson emerges from Site-XYZ and stands under a tent in front of a podium. The crowds applauds. //(it sprinkles)// Agent Macky jumps Peri from a bush behind him. Ap is halfway up the ruins. Agent Macky starts xyr ascent.]

[Peri lifts his head to watch Agent Macky. He quickly tucks his head back when Agent Macky stops and scans xyr environment. Macky continues xyr approach to Ap, and xe pulls out a needle. Missing xyr footing, Agent Macky swings against the scaffolding. Xe drop the needle, twists xyr ankle, and hits the tower.]

[Ap is alerted. //(it rains)// Ap pulls out a knife. Agent Macky swings xyr body away from Ap. Peri quickly scales the ruins. Ap tries to step on Macky&#39;s hands as xe pulls xyrself onto the platform. Agent Macky assumes a defensive stance. Ap replaces her knife, and holds up her fists.]

[Footage captures Peri shouting as he ascends.]

[Ap throws a punch. Agent Macky deflects the attack and uppercuts Ap&#39;s jaw. She stumbles and grabs a pillar to maintain her balance.]

[Jesse Waterson finishes his address and he returns to Site-XYZ. Agent Macky throws another punch. Ap reels backward and falls back on her knees. Peri pulls himself onto the platform, jumps Agent Macky and places a cloth over xyr mouth. Xe ceases movement.]

[A security guard next to the stage, pulls out a crossbow and attempts to shoot Mr. Waterson. The shooter is tackled by security and the arrow ricochets into the sky. While struggling with security its helmet falls off revealing Salem Glass. //(paper and other debris are kicked up by the wind)// Banky runs from the crowd and helps Salem. The two flee the scene.]

[Ap attempts to set up her scope; her brother tugs at her and shakes his head. Ap pushes her brother away and turns back to the scope. //(lightning flashes in the corner of the frame)// Peri speaks, and Ap&#39;s shoulders relax. He talks for roughly a minute.[[footnote]]Agent Macky&#39;s voice recorder had unintentionally been turned on during the fight with Ap. Refer to Audio Log 7000.3.1 for more details.[[/footnote]]]

[She sighs and packs her gear. //(wind visibly slows, rain begins to let up)// Peri starts his descent as Ap replaces her bow and begins her descent.]

[A team of security personnel wait for Peri and Ap at the base of the ruins. Peri removes his bullwhip and Ap grabs onto her brother&#39;s waist. The whip latches onto a tree branch and the twins swing over security. They disappear into the brush. Roughly thirty seconds go by before a motorcycle is seen speeding in the top left corner of the footage.]
