Hello!  I’m bigslothonmyface. I usually go by Sloth. I started writing here in 2021 after reading the site for almost a decade. Though it’s not a hard-and-fast rule, I try to write pieces that leverage the SCP format to comment on social justice, especially environmental issues and marginalized communities. IRL, I’m an MFA-trained nonfiction writer, teacher and journalist. 

Thanks for reading! I’m flattered to work among so many talented artists.

[[module ListPages name=&#34;SCP-6002&#34;]]
**%%title_linked%%: All Creatures Great And Small**
Created on %%created_at%% | Score: %%rating%%
A tree with the DNA of every living thing in its branches, the man who poisoned it, and the woman trying to save it.
[[collapsible show=&#34;▼ Show commentary&#34; hide=&#34;▲ Hide&#34;]]
I spent over a month devising, revising and polishing this piece, my first (and still favorite) for the wiki, and my entry for the 6K contest.

In my original drafts, I learned harder into eugenics: Muller killed 10 percent of the human population overnight by ill-advisedly editing the Tree, and Rose free climbed up it for three hours to fight him off herself. I ultimately decided that a coverup was a more accurate depiction of how a powerful coward would act, and allowed me to explore my characters in greater depth—but rest assured that Rose is a certified badass and absolutely destroyed the old bastard in their fight.

The Aeterns are meant to encapsulate many different fictional creatures, and give backstory for a range of myth. I will, however, admit to a mild Pokémon inspiration. I’m a lifelong fan.

[[module ListPages name=&#34;SCP-6250&#34;]]
**%%title_linked%%: Keystone Flats**
Created on %%created_at%% | Score: %%rating%%
A poisonous city, spilling out from our minds and into reality.
[[collapsible show=&#34;▼ Show commentary&#34; hide=&#34;▲ Hide&#34;]]
Took me about three weeks to write from start to finish. I envisioned this as a story about urban sprawl, in the form of a suburb that never stopped expanding. Acting on that was a challenge, and I feel the final product falls a little short of what I hoped for. Still, urban sprawl makes for a good, but challenging, memetic skip: a series of interconnected, wasteful practices that collectively redefine physical space. I hope nobody was weirded out by me driving around their cul-de-sacs with my camera sourcing images!

Created on %%created_at%% | Score: %%rating%%
Hydroelectric beavers who love you.
[[collapsible show=&#34;▼ Show commentary&#34; hide=&#34;▲ Hide&#34;]]
A feel-good article born from a pun, and one I decided I wanted to be short. For all that, I worked on it for a week, and most of that time was spent omitting needless words. I streamlined the conprocs and description dozens of times, saving maybe a word or two each time, until I was happy with my rhythm.

My favorite headcanon about this piece is that the beavers are using cold fusion to generate the power. I nearly acted on psychicprogrammer’s suggestion that the dams emit neutrinos to suggest that. So, if you’re wondering: beaver fusion. That’s how it works.

**%%title_linked%%: Leave it. Burn it.**
Created on %%created_at%% | Score: %%rating%%
A refugee community that&#39;s just a little too difficult to remember.
[[collapsible show=&#34;▼ Show commentary&#34; hide=&#34;▲ Hide&#34;]]
A gift for [[*user Gabriel McQueen]] in the 2021 Holiday Gift Exchange, in response to their prompt: 

&gt; …a tale, article, or poem about a location made strange, lonely, or haunted. Something has happened here, it may be unclear just what, before the time that the story picks up, that has changed a once innocuous place into something…else.

I had been working for a while on a skip about climate refugees, inspired by the city in England whose residents have been told the town will be forsaken to rising sea levels. I adopted that idea for the Exchange, and expanded it into a more general commentary how easily displaced peoples are disregarded. My goal was to suggest that the folks in Grace are not actually impossible to remember—they are just *inconvenient,* and that’s all it takes for the Foundation to fail them. I don’t know how well that got across in the end, but this remains a piece I’m quite proud of. I worked on it for a month, largely focused on streamlining and expanding the found documents.

**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2003 SCP-2003 — Preferred Option], by [[*user Kalinin]]**
My favorite SCP??? Maybe. From the conceit of a preferred timeline and how random events bring it about, to the twist use of BigDog, to the wild and often-prophetic alternative sets for our future… This is a piece that rewards you for clicking on its collapsibles. Its scope, structure and portrayal of the Foundation have all had a lasting impact on my work.

**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5001 SCP-5001 — Sacrosanct], by [[*user Yossipossi]]**
The other contender for my favorite SCP. Apparently I just love weird, bigass tech working in unexpected ways! The timeline of the breach is the strength of this piece: it builds tension so effectively and doesn’t waste words. A major inspiration for me as I try to write logs of my own.

**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1342 SCP-1342 — To The Makers of Music], by [[*user FlameShirt]]**
This is a science-y skip that ends on a note written outside of the Foundationspeak voice and which is utterly heart-wrenching. I blatantly rip this off for the commentary (especially the ending note) in SCP-6002.

**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5740 SCP-5740 — all cop are buddy by dado] and [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5004 SCP-5004 — MEGALOMANIA], by [[*user djkaktus]]**
These two pieces lured me back to the wiki after nearly a decade away. This isn’t how I write, nor do I think I COULD write in these voices. But these pieces demonstrated to me that the SCP Foundation could be a tool for modern social change, which was the spark I needed to try and really get into writing. That insistence on real-world relevance has become a hallmark of my work. I approach my topics… less directly than kak does in these skips, but I appreciate the powerful leftist voice that comes through here all the same.

**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1555 SCP-1555 — The Facility], by [[*user atomicthumbs]]**
Single-handedly cemented weird industrial locations as the scariest type of skip for me. Also my go-to example of something incomprehensibly strange. I borrowed from its suddenly-shifting randomness for SCP-6250, and I hope to do so again. Losing its images did irreparable harm and I hope they find their way back some day.

**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/on-guard-43-hub On Guard 43], by [[*user HarryBlank]] and many others**
If I had to pick a canon that best exemplifies “the Foundation but if it was real,” OG43 would be my choice. Harry&#39;s Canadian dug-out adds a much-needed element of relatable humanity back into a universe that often lacks it, and pushes the site to confront questions about justice, society and identity that go beyond its usual collection-of-curiosities vibe. Site-43 treats anomalies with fear and care, but also with respect; its characters are bored, curious and political just as much as they are cold geniuses; and it manages all of this without losing that classic SCP grounding in absolutely batshit, horrific anomalies that would destroy the world without containment in place.

**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3100 SCP-3100 — The Reliquary], by [[*user minmin]]**
This is my favorite by far of the “what if the afterlife is really shitty / what if we don’t die” trope on the site. What I like is that it does just far enough with the technobabble and unexplained decisionmaking to add creepiness, but still gives me something human and terrifying to grab onto.

**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-072 SCP-072 — The Foot of the Bed], by [[*user Kate McTiriss]]**
The reason that I haven’t been able to sleep without tucking my feet under the blankets since February 2013. Probably the skip that’s had the longest-lasting “real-world” effect on how I behave.

**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3091 SCP-3091 — Temporal Funnel Trap], by [[*user Sophia Light]]**
The Red Room anomaly is so ominous! And the mysterious facility built at an unknown time for an unknown purpose has big 5001 vibes (I know it came earlier, of course).

**Anything by Amy Hempel (my favorite is &#34;Weekend&#34;)**
//Prose poetry//

&#34;And when the men kissed the women good night, and their weekend whiskers scratched the women&#39;s cheeks, the women did not think shave, they thought: stay.&#34;

**//Citizen//, Claudia Rankine**
//Lyric//

&#34;Perhaps the most insidious and least understood form of segregation is that of the word.&#34;

**//Hiroshima//, John Hersey**
//Narrative nonfiction//

&#34;There, in the tin factory, in the first moment of the atomic age, a human being was crushed by books.&#34;

**&#34;Street Haunting&#34;, Virginia Woolf**
//Personal essay//

As the foxhunter hunts in order to preserve the breed of foxes, and the golfer plays in order that open spaces may be preserved from the builders, so when the desire comes upon us to go street rambling the pencil does for a pretext, and getting up we say: &#34;Really I must buy a pencil.”

**&#34;Once More To The Lake&#34;, E.B. White**
//Personal essay//

&#34;As he buckled the swollen belt, suddenly my groin felt the chill of death.&#34;

**The nonfiction of George Orwell (particularly &#34;A Hanging&#34; and &#34;Such, Such Were The Joys&#34;)**

&#34;When I saw the prisoner step aside to avoid the puddle, I saw the mystery, the unspeakable wrongness, of cutting a life short when it is in full tide.&#34;

**//So Long, See You Tomorrow//, William Maxwell**
//Memoir//

&#34;Memory—meaning a moment, a scene, a fact that has been subjected to a fixative and thereby rescued from oblivion—is really a form of storytelling that goes on continually in the mind and often changes with the telling.&#34;

**The //Bartimaeus// trilogy, Jonathan Stroud**
//Fantasy fiction//

&#34;A dozen more questions occurred to me. Not to mention twenty-two possible solutions to each one, sixteen resulting hypotheses and counter-theorems, eight abstract speculations, a quadrilateral equation, two axioms, and a limerick.&#34;

**The //Jeeves and Wooster// series, P.G. Woodhouse**
//Fiction//

“Psychology is admittedly odd, sir. The poet Pope...&#34;
&#34;Never mind about the poet Pope, Jeeves.&#34;
&#34;No, sir.&#34;
&#34;There are times when one wants to hear all about the poet Pope and times when one doesn&#39;t.&#34;
&#34;Very true, sir.&#34;

**//Limetown//, Two-Up Productions**
//Audio drama//

&#34;The gate to Limetown was left open. What the world discovered was the complete disappearance of every man, woman and child. Three hundred and twenty seven people.&#34;

**//She-Ra and the Princesses of Power//, ND Stevenson**
//Animated TV series//

&#34;I am brave, strong, loyal, and I give great hugs.&#34;

**//Howl’s Moving Castle//, Hayao Miyazaki**
//Animated film//

&#34;A heart’s a heavy burden.&#34;
