Down the hall, the soldier makes thunderous marches
Holding within is the brewing storm in his bones.
His black armor clouds the sparks of the devil within
With attempts to summon an angel for guidance.

Through the window holds an unyielding beast.
He eyes the soldier, sniffing the demons he contains.
With the many voices, his words lit a sun to wash the
Clouds away. A brother always has a brother’s back.

Ahead is the ghost. Her scars writhe and thirsts for blood.
She sings her, “Vivir mi vida”, while she pops a drop of
painkillers in her system. Morning and evening is a constant
Battle with her screaming body. How she wishes to rip it out.

The angel watches all. Every staff to every monster
That their cages can hold. A library of plains, passions
Pleasures, and pains. She promises them that one day
She will bring them into the light. If she can fool them.

The Director of Site-63 makes tabs. To the soldier and his
Machine body and vicious mind. To the beast and
The hunger he shares with a greater lion. To the ghost
And the scarlet hue in her eyes. Angels have long left.

Through these halls, they pass by each other. Their lives
Akin to a confluence. It would be the unified reason as to
Why they continue to work in The Foundation. Because no
One deserves the burdens they carry alone in the dark.</textarea></pre>
