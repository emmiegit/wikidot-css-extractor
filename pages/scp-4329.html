**Item #:** SCP-4329

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4329-A is publicly listed as a communal property belonging to the ‘Escerpan’s Church of Saints’ sect.[[footnote]]A pseudo-religious Foundation front claiming to be a small denomination of the Latter Day Saint movement.[[/footnote]] 

Individuals attempting to access SCP-4329-A without permission are to be apprehended, questioned, then released to local law authorities if necessary; standard ‘Escerpanian’ doctrine can be cited to justify questioning.

SCP-4329-A is to be checked daily for unauthorised FM radio receivers tuned to SCP-4329-B’s radio band. Any encountered are to be logged and relocated outside SCP-4329-B’s broadcast range or destroyed if necessary.

Quotes recited by SCP-4329-B are to be recorded and logged, along with a record of the respective item/s. Items manifested by SCP-4329 must be located as soon as possible; on-site personnel must exhibit extreme caution as the items could be hazardous or lethal. 

SCP-4329-B is to be constantly monitored for any deviation in behaviour.

In the event inhibition of SCP-4329-B becomes necessary, the 9:00 AM news broadcast of ‘[DATA REDACTED]’ is to be delayed for as long as needed. If necessary, ‘[DATA REDACTED]’ is to be shut down indefinitely to potentially neutralise SCP-4329.

**Description:** SCP-4329 is an anomalous radio broadcast (SCP-4329-B) occupying the ███.█ FM band, localised to the property boundaries of [DATA REDACTED], Beerwah, Australia (SCP-4329-A).

External to SCP-4329-A, the ███.█ FM band is used by ‘[DATA REDACTED]’, a local radio station; --to date, no connection between SCP-4329 and ‘[DATA REDACTED]’ has been found.-- While within the property, the transmissions of ‘[DATA REDACTED]’ appear to be totally suppressed by SCP-4329-B.

Attempts to triangulate the source of SCP-4329-B have been unsuccessful; tests conducted indicate that SCP-4329-B originates a significant distance north-west of SCP-4329-A, rendering the source impossible to locate since the transmission cannot be detected outside of SCP-4329-A. Of note is that Mount Coochin, the closest mountain to SCP-4329-A, is located north-west of the property.

Each day --at 9:00 AM local time-- coinciding with the 9:00 AM news broadcast of ‘[DATA REDACTED]’, a male voice will recite a quote via SCP-4329-B. No theme or relation has yet been identified between these phrases; identified sources include book excerpts, (presumed) packaging labels, TV or video game dialogue, internet memes, song lyrics, sentences from confidential documents, jokes and brand slogans.

The remainder of SCP-4329-B’s broadcast time comprises entirely of continuous, faint breathing.

Immediately following the conclusion of an SCP-4329-B vocalisation, a random object will manifest somewhere within the boundaries of SCP-4329-A. No correlation between an object and its corresponding phrase, nor between each of the objects, has yet been identified.

**Addendum 1:** Samples of recorded phrases &amp; manifested items.

&gt; **Phrase:** And God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light. God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.’
&gt; 
&gt; **Source:** Genesis 1:3-4 of the New International Version of the Bible.
&gt; 
&gt; **Item:** A custom-made digital device that appears to have been intended to function as a radio broadcaster; the internal components were incorrectly assembled, rendering the device non-functional at recovery. Manifested inside a bedroom.

&gt; **Phrase:** If you can steal an idea from someone’s mind, why can’t you plant one there instead?
&gt; 
&gt; **Source:** Dialogue of ‘Saito’, //Inception//.
&gt; 
&gt; **Item:** A standard G36 Glock handgun. Object discharged a single round upon manifestation, injuring an on-site guard; no other ammunition present in the firearm. Residents around SCP-4329-A alerted local authorities, see: Incident 4329-7. Manifested outside the front door of the building.

&gt; **Phrase:** Da zdravstvuyet sozdanny voley narodov.
&gt; 
&gt; **Source:** Third line of ‘Славься, Отечество наше свободное’, the USSR State Anthem. Translation: ‘Long live the creation of the will of the people.’
&gt; 
&gt; **Item:** Seven Abyssinian guinea pigs. Colouration and behaviour suggest all originate from the same litter. Manifested in the hands of several on-site personnel. All instances are under extended on-site observation, but appear to be mundane.

&gt; **Phrase:** Old Montag wanted to fly near the sun and now that he’s burnt his damn wings, he wonders why.
&gt; 
&gt; **Source:** Dialogue of ‘Captain Beatty’, //Fahrenheit 451//.
&gt; 
&gt; **Item:** A Silver Youtube Play Button, lacking plaque and inscription. Design of the award suggests it was manufactured prior to March 2018[[footnote]]After which the design was changed to an engraved metal plaque.[[/footnote]], with the composition matching post-March 2017 models. Manifested inside a sandwich stored in a fridge.

&gt; **Phrase:** The tools of offence and defence are all found in agricultural instruments.
&gt; 
&gt; **Source:** //Taigong’s Six Secret Teachings//, as translated by Anjie Anderson and Mengchen Wang.
&gt; 
&gt; **Item:** --Unknown; item, if any, has yet to be located.-- A 300-gram trapezohedral mass of neptunium-237. Manifested inside the west wall of the main bedroom. Located after on-site staff began exhibiting symptoms of radiation poisoning.

&gt; **Phrase:** For more than forty-eight hours for children and adolescents, aged seven to seventeen, except on medical advice.
&gt; 
&gt; **Source:** Indeterminate; content suggests generic dosage instructions/warning for a medicine.
&gt; 
&gt; **Item:** A Lenoxx-brand CD player, containing an unmarked CD. The only file on the CD was a recording of //The Year 1812 Solemn Overture// by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, which the CD player began playing from the 11:30 mark at maximum volume. Starting time noted to be significant as the iconic cannon fire – which was present in the recording – began 35 seconds later. Manifested in the ceiling space above the bathroom.

&gt; **Phrase:** Microhabitat. Noun. A limited area of one kind of habitat, differing from the areas around it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Source:** //Oxford Australian Student’s Colour Dictionary//, Third edition.
&gt; 
&gt; **Item:** A 300-page handwritten essay titled ‘Why the numbers ten through nineteen are stupid’, advocating for the aforementioned numbers to be renamed to match the naming conventions of later numbers[[footnote]]E.g. ten to ‘onety’, eleven to ‘onety-one’, twelve to ‘onety-two’, etc.[[/footnote]] without citing any external sources. No author is named, but the handwriting style matches that of Elvis Presley. Manifested on a workbench in the garage.

&gt; **Phrase:** Worse yet, what remains has become too saline to support any of the native species that once filled its waters.
&gt; 
&gt; **Source:** //National Geographic//, Vol. 177, No. 2 (February 1990), Pg. 72.
&gt; 
&gt; **Item:** A single cinderblock brick. Manifested above the building’s television aerial, damaging it.

&gt; **Phrase:** A thing that doesn’t change with time is a memory of younger days.
&gt; 
&gt; **Source:** Dialogue of ‘Sheik’, //The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time// or //The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D//.[[footnote]]Note: Identical dialogue occurs in both games.[[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **Item:** A volume of seawater sufficient to completely fill the laundry room, which it manifested within.

&gt; **Phrase:** And then the witch doctor, he told me what to do.
&gt; 
&gt; **Source:** Lyrics from //Witch Doctor// by Ross Bagdasarian Senior.
&gt; 
&gt; **Item:** A lightly-worn copy of //The Angel’s Command// by Brian Jacques, February 2004 paperback reprint. Internal pages of the book are blank, but the appropriate number is present. Manifested on the front porch beside a rainwater pipe.

&gt; **Phrase:** Big chungus.
&gt; 
&gt; **Source:** Internet meme; multiple sources.
&gt; 
&gt; **Item:** An indeterminate, but large, volume of potassium. Substance manifested within the underground piping of SCP-4329-A, detonating and causing severe damage to the on-site water and sewerage infrastructure. Presence of potassium hydroxide identified the explosion’s source.

&gt; **Phrase:** Immediately following the conclusion of an SCP-4329-B vocalisation, a random object will manifest somewhere within the boundaries of SCP-4329-A.
&gt; 
&gt; **Source:** Containment file of SCP-4329. The phrase suggests SCP-4329-B may have some awareness of its own containment.
&gt; 
&gt; **Item:** A single //Brachychiton rupestris// sapling, one metre in height, with common potting soil. Item manifested in the driveway, displacing a portion of concrete.

&gt; **Phrase:** No-one ever said it would be so hard. I’m going back to the start.
&gt; 
&gt; **Source:** Lyrics from //The Scientist// by Coldplay. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Item:** A copy of the album //A Rush of Blood to the Head// by Coldplay. To date, this is the only item to hold a known relation to its corresponding phrase;[[footnote]]//The Scientist// is the fourth song in the album.[[/footnote]] as this has not reoccurred, it is currently believed to be a coincidence.
