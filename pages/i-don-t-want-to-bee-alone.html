**[Excerpts on life during the war from the view of a civilian]**
1/22/19
It&#39;s already been a year since The Foundation was revealed to us. Times are tough, and the war has no signs of stopping. My cousin, Daryl, has been getting sicker by the day, and I have to devote all of my free time to taking care of him. And the President&#39;s televised reassurance isn&#39;t helping at all, hack. Going to try get more rations soon, but times are tough, and there aren&#39;t enough to go around.

1/30/19
There have been more people signing up for the military as of late, which means more food to go around. It&#39;s become easier to take care of Daryl, but his condition isn&#39;t really showing any improvement. I heard about 10 miles from here is a town with an old medical university. Maybe if i&#39;m lucky, there could be some kind of medical professional there. Going with Daryl in about a week or two.

2/6/19
We arrived at the university town, and found a nice B&amp;B to stay in temporarily. Also found someone who could help us. Robert, a junior at the university in town before the war started. He said he had a hard time diagnosing Daryl&#39;s condition, and might need another opinion on it. Hopefully we at least get Daryl&#39;s condition diagnosed soon.

2/14/19
Robert contacted his friend named Justine a week ago, but we never heard back. Daryl&#39;s condition is getting much worse, and I&#39;m really worried about him. Rations are starting to become sparse, but we manage. The owners of the B&amp;B are allowing us to still stay, despite me being low on cash. It&#39;s important to remember that not everyone&#39;s an asshole.

2/16/19
It&#39;s clear to us that Daryl is in alot of pain, and Robert suggests assisted suicide. He is leaving the decision up to me. I hoped that i&#39;d never have to make a decision like this.

2/17/19
I decided to put him out of his misery. He was always like a brother to me. Fuck this stupid war, it&#39;s pointless.

2/28/19
I don&#39;t have much money, but we tried to give him a modest funeral. Robert apologized and gave his condolences. I&#39;m not mad at him, he did his best, and right now, that&#39;s all he could do. I&#39;ll be heading home soon.

3/21/19
All we have left is water, stale bread, and shitty soup. We&#39;ll throw whatever we can find in a big pot and boil it in water. The President keeps assuring us that the war will be short, but it&#39;s obvious BS. I hope I at least get to see the war end before I die of old age.

10/31/19
It&#39;s already Halloween, time went by alot faster than I expected. Some more SCPs got leaked recently, and people wasted no time putting together costumes. Some of them are even pretty damn terrifying too. But since we don&#39;t have any treats, there&#39;s bound to be alot of tricks this year. Too bad cleaning supplies are a rarity, my house is going to look terrible.

12/23/19
This is my first second Christmas alone. It&#39;s cold as shit outside, and my heating&#39;s busted. At least I have a ton of bed sheets I can use as blankets. Even though this year has been horrible, there&#39;s still some of that Christmas magic. All I can do now is hope for the future.

9/17/20
No one is making progress in the war, it&#39;s just an elaborate draw.

11/12/20
Because of rations getting even lower, people are getting desperate. I&#39;ve seen people pick up frogs, snakes, and even their own pets to throw in a stew. Their own fucking pets! At least send us some food for gods sake.

12/3/20
My neighbors went missing the other day, and nobody acted like it was strange. I&#39;m worried about them, but I stopped asking questions about them, I don&#39;t want to go missing too.

12/5/20
I was asked to clean up the soup kitchen today. Found my neighbors bones in yesterday&#39;s stew pot. I&#39;m getting the fuck out of here.

12/9/20
I&#39;ve been locked in my own home. My keys are missing, and all the doors and windows are locked and boarded up. I think they know I know. I&#39;m fucked.

12/11/20
There was a fight or something yesterday. Heard alot of yelling and a gunshot. This town has truly gone to shit.

12/20/20
Been here 10 11 days. Food is being put in my home when I sleep. They don&#39;t want me boney when i&#39;m thrown in the pot. Hope help comes soon.

1/1/21
It&#39;s very quiet, too damn quiet.

1/2/21
Heard the boards being broken today. Thought I was done for. Then the weirdest thing happened. These, things, pulled me out of the house. They were tall, humanoid bees. I thought I was having a strange dream or hallucination, but it was real! Thank god i&#39;m OK.

1/5/21
I&#39;ve been feeling great lately, and I bet it&#39;s because of all the wonderful bees people that saved me. I live like a king compared to last year, It&#39;s amazing!

1/8/21
I felt kind of terrible yesterday, but still overall had a great day. They told me that I was fine, and I believe them. I mean, after them pulling me out of that shit hole, Why wouldn&#39;t I?

**[Unintelligible]**/21
I feel like fucking shit today
**[Unintelligible]**

10/12/21
Found this old notebook from before my transfiguration. I didn&#39;t know it was so painful for him, but oh well. He was sacrificed for our noble cause.

10/29/21
There&#39;s been reports of unidentified armed soldiers in the area. I hope to god they&#39;re with us.

**[Addendum]**
Excerpt was found in a small town in [DATA EXPUNGED]. Town was subjected to assault, and arson. It is unknown at this time who perpetrated the attack.</textarea></pre>
