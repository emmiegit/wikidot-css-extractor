SCP-3449 main file, dictated by Dr. Eric Duboy.

**Item Number:** SCP-3449

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment for SCP-3449 has been split into two aspects. Memetic, biological, and psychological department personnel are to research methods of alleviating symptoms caused by exposure to SCP-3449. 

All other personnel are to work to develop a method of communication impervious to SCP-3449’s effects. This project will be led by the Foundation Linguistics department.

**Description:** SCP-3449 is an infectious cognitohazard now present in at least 98% of the human population. SCP-3449 effects take place in multiple stages. 

During stage one, an affected individual will make a number of syntactical errors when writing about SCP-3449. This is believed to be caused by an incubation period where SCP-3449 adjusts to the affected person’s body, mind, and vernacular.

Stage two begins approximately a month after stage one.  SCP-3449 begins to inhibit all written communication. The severity of the inhibition increases over time until Stage three.

Stage three begins when an affected individual can no longer communicate using a written language. All attempts to generate a coherent series of symbols fail in various ways. See experiment log for details. 

While the transmission vector for SCP-3449 is still unknown, the leading theory suggests that it spreads to any person who communicates with an affected individual. Either listening to or reading text written by affected persons would transmit SCP-3449.

SCP-3449 experiment log dictated by Dr. William Teller.

To stop the spread of SCP-3449, we’re trying to identify or construct a written language that SCP-3449 is unable to affect. We decided that, when possible, we’d have subjects both try to hand write and type out the language. It’d be pretty bad if we had a winner, but we just had to put it in cursive. (laughs) Ah… I&#39;m never getting used to this am I?

//Break//

Ok, we just did our control test with English. Subjects hand writing sentences drew arbitrary symbols in place of letters, and subjects typing sentences kept pressing the wrong key to spell the word they wanted. Nothing new really.

//Break//

Logging results for an assisted form of English. We supplied subjects with words to choose from and they tried to arrange them in a sentence. 

This showed some promise, since subjects could get the first word right, but couldn’t do much after that. They&#39;d forget which word came next. It&#39;s something, but I don’t think it’s enough to survive off, since you can only say one word, and it has to be written on something nearby. Better than nothing I guess. 

//Break//

Logging results for our test of written Morse Code. Chose this one because it’s simple to write, and if it works we don’t have to teach the world from scratch. 

Worked real nice for the first week. Almost made an announcement to record everything with morse code. Then the subjects started having trouble moving their hands correctly. Kept writing the wrong thing. Now everyone who tries it can only make a rapid succession of dots. We got people to try sending regular morse code, but they had the same issues. All dots, no dash. 

//Break//

This is less of an experiment log and more of an update. A separate initiative to teach the Foundation sign language has failed. People can’t seem to make the right gestures in a row anymore. They’ve tried formalizing a bunch of different systems, but they fail in the same way. Luckily, it&#39;s not like shrugging and waving are gone but... they might be one day.

//Break//

More news about the gestures. O5 ordered us to keep physical communication to a minimum so we have some sort of back up if we ever lose verbal communication. I think they freaked out a little when we lost sign language. So... I guess we did lose shrugging and waving.
    
//Break//

Just recording that we proposed testing speech to text software, but it was denied. People too worried that the anomaly will stop us from talking altogether.

//Break//

Tried a new approach with pictograms. The idea was that the creative license in freestyle drawing would confuse it. We were close. It lasted a month, but then the entire idea of drawings got fucked… um… sorry, I mean people stopped being able to draw properly. Leading theory: similar pictures of a concept are analogous to using the same symbol for a letter over and over again. 

That was probably our last shot. At least I’m out of ideas. Who knows? Maybe we’ll come up with something.

I hope we come up with something.

Um… Ok. This entry is by Researcher Niklo Gerdinel. Uh, Addendum SCP-3449-2, I guess? You know what, screw the formalities. It’s not like I’m supposed to making an entry and, like, there’s not really anyone left to reprimand me. 

As you can probably tell we really screwed the pooch on this one. A few days ago the anomaly finally started messing with speech, so the world’s freaking out about it. Not that we really figured out how to operate without writing. That was uh… that straight up didn&#39;t work. Economies fell apart. Riots broke out. Shit hit the fan.

Not that we gave in. We kept spinning our wheels trying to think of something. Alternative languages, vaccines, countermemes. But nothing worked. It was all picked apart by the anomaly.

Like, like, I used to write letters to my girlfriend. It was like a monthly thing between us. And when the um… when the anomaly got to us, we switched to just using drawings. I’m a shit artist, but at least they got the point across. You know, picture’s worth a thousand words and all that. 

But all Foundation mail gets screened, so someone saw it and tried to, tried to use pictures for communication. Made a bunch of pictograms and shit. Now I… I can’t draw. And, and I haven&#39;t gotten a letter from my girlfriend so I don&#39;t know if she&#39;s just waiting for me to write back or maybe she&#39;s just dead.

And you know what? Some of the people here just take it so lightly. Maybe its a coping mechanism but... but they argue over semantics and exactly how to classify this thing. Is it a cognitohazard? Is it a new form of virus? Is it even an anomaly? It&#39;s everywhere now, so maybe it&#39;s the new normal. Like any of that matters. They’re spending their last words on meaningless debate.

You know the last thing I said to my mom and dad? “Maybe don’t serve broccoli next time.” I told my dog “I’ll be home for dinner” which turned out to be a lie. The last thing my g-girlfriend got from me was a picture of a bunch of stick figures wearing glasses, with a heart at the bottom. At least I drew the heart but... but it’s just so stupid. So fucking stupid. I thought my last words to these people would be something elegant, you know? Or loving. But I’m stuck with this instead. Some sarcasm, a lie, and //fucking stick figures//. And even if they&#39;re not dead and I see them again we’ll probably just look at each other. Just looking and waiting. Everyone just looking and waiting and looking and waiting and looking and waiting until the day we die!

//Pause.//

Uh… s-s-surry ab-bout that I uh… It’s been a stressful f-few days. Although if you’re hearing this you can probably imagine. I guess I… um… curted this entra kinda as a… as a last hurrah for myself. And gu knows? These m-m-might be the last w-w-words ever re-re-caaad-d-ded. So… as a uh… final m-m-message from m-me to whoever’s out there. 

//Gerdinel swallows.// 

Good luck, and know you’re lurv... yur lurrrrv

//Gerdinel wimpers//

&gt; //0:53// - Researcher&#39;s face relaxes. Maintains eye contact with camera, however it is less intense. 
&gt; 
&gt; //1:06// - Researcher glances down, and shakes head slightly. He immediately resumes eye contact with the camera, while still shaking his head.
