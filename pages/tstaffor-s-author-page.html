This started out as an Imposter Challenge of Placeholder&#39;s work, but as it went on it definitely morphed more into my patented &#34;series of no-dialogue logs&#34; style scip.

This is currently the article on this site I&#39;m absolutely the proudest of.  Other than a slight change to the final log, this was the first draft that I wrote all in one go!

This was the first draft I ever wrote. It goes without saying that it was //not// good, but I came back to it and fixed it up quite a bit and now it&#39;s currently my favorite thing I&#39;ve written and what I&#39;m most proud of!

This also has an extended [[[experiment-log-5846|Experiment Log]]]. It&#39;s pretty exciting to see others take my idea and add to it in such creative ways!

Between this and the food court article, you obviously have a certain level of skill for linguistic turns. The possessive twist is really clever, and wordplay such as Ghoti/Goatee is something I personally find quite difficult to come up with.

This is an adaptation of an AI-generated prompt! I created it from the following generated text:
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
Item #: SCP-XXXX

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-XXXX is to be contained in a standard Locked Secure Container as Site-██. No personnel are to enter SCP-XXXX&#39;s container without Level 4 clearance.

Description: SCP-XXXX is a small, black cube with a singular red button on one face. SCP-XXXX was recovered from the office of Dr. ████ after an incident in which [DATA EXPUNGED].

When the button on SCP-XXXX is pressed, a small door opens on the top face of the cube. Inside is a miniature version of the room SCP-XXXX is contained in, complete with a miniature version of SCP-XXXX. Pressing the button on the miniature SCP-XXXX causes the door to close and the miniature to disappear. The process can be repeated an infinite number of times.

The miniature versions of the room and SCP-XXXX are exact replicas, down to the smallest detail. However, the rooms and SCP-XXXXs inside the replicas are not exact replicas, and are instead random variations. The replicas are also inhabited by miniature versions of the personnel who were in the room when the button was pressed, which are also random variations.

It is unknown how SCP-XXXX creates the replicas, or how it is able to store them inside itself.

Ever since Fishish posted the first thing for the Department of Unreality I&#39;ve wanted to write something for it! I was trying to think of what to use for it for the longest time, and then finally, I thought &#34;What about pattern Screamers? They seem similar!&#34; and boom! I clipped parts from SCPs I loved and made a really fun meta cross-link heavy scip!

First of all, this was my first SCP. 

Secondly, yes. This is 100% a thinly veiled excuse 
to make tons of food puns.

Thirdly, I had made this as a Level for the Backrooms Wiki at first but halfway through I realized the meat of the article was the audio log so I ported that over and added some set-up for it.

I really liked the concept of a rubber duck who has been scarred from inadvertently killing anyone that tries to hang out with it, so when cremo first posted this and it got downvoted, I jumped on rewriting it. It seems like people have enjoyed it now given it&#39;s currently my most upvoted article on the wiki!

This was my first attempt at horror. I tried out fridge horror with the realization this duck was discarded because a father accidentally killed his child by sending them a very unfinished prototype.

Got to the end of the description and wasn’t quite sure where this one was going. It’s a good example of the narrative and the main hook of the article being quite separate from the core anomaly. There’s a nice bit of fridge logic with the fear of humans, and the texts are a good way to tell this story.

It was wonderful working with Plague. He brought tons of great ideas to the table and this wouldn&#39;t be what it is today without him.

This is a rewrite of the previous Corn Goblin by [[*user BaronJoe]]. It didn&#39;t have much for a narrative so we&#39;ve added quite a bit of story. 

Also, I just have to quickly take full credit for the GoI Goat of Interest line.

After reading through the entire catalog of Herman Fuller GoI formats, I realized they mostly followed the same gimmick of Herman abusing the act in question and the author of the book feeling bad for the act. I decided to write a format screw of the concept where the article&#39;s main focus is not the act featured on the poster but a different one entirely and Herman would like the act and the author would be the one to hate it.
