This message is to be distributed to all Foundation personnel:

In recent weeks, we have lost a lot of good men. To those of you at stationed at Sites far away from their passings, this may come as a surprise, as containment breaches are at a quarterly low. Those of you at the Sites which have lost men know the cause: A mass epidemic of suicides is sweeping the SCP Foundation.

Before you panic, know that our top researchers and doctors have determined that this is //not// any sort of memetic kill hazard unleashed upon the personnel of the Foundation, nor does it have anything to do with the new set of anomalous objects whose exact properties we have yet to classify. Everything is, as of this writing, still locked up nice and tight. Near as we can tell, there are simply a lot of people working for us who have gotten depressed. As such, this notice has been sent to you in the hopes of preventing any more unnecessary losses. It is respectfully asked that you not take any further action until you finish reading.

A lot has been made of the suicides of Researcher Kermode and Doctor Shears. They aren&#39;t the only two who have chosen to take their lives in these past weeks, but they are the ones whose stories have been spread around the most. Their notes indicated, respectively, that they didn&#39;t matter in the grand scheme of things, and that they held far too much responsibility. Our psychological branches have instructed me to not refute these claims; individually, there&#39;s a lot that&#39;s bigger than us, and it&#39;s entirely possible that we may one day screw up. There is really no point in trying to sugar coat reality, even if it is for a good cause.

The problem with their arguments is that they don&#39;t see any of the //good// we as the Foundation do. Kermode failed to see himself as a part of something working for the greater benefit of mankind, and Shears, while sidestepping the issue, thought only of the gloom and doom the Foundation could bring upon everyone.

In contrast to what those two and many others thought before taking their lives, the situation we are in is possibly one of the best the Foundation has ever seen. We have found a record number of anomalous objects in the past year, gained enough people to more than keep up with our hiring needs, and successfully lowered containment breaches by sixty percent. If we were going to crush the world in our hands, we would have done so by now.

The very idea that committing suicide is somehow going to //improve// our situation is absolutely ludicrous. However, there is, once again, the fact that we simply live in a very, very grim world. It&#39;s hard to get through the day living with the knowledge we have. But you all really do need to remember, things simply are not that bad.

We are doing the right thing. We are being incredibly successful at it. We are making things better. We are actively saving lives. And we need you to keep your life protected. If you just remember that, we can nip this suicide thing in the bum, and get back to making the world a better place.

It&#39;s rare for a message from higher up to end this way, but have a nice day.

-Sgt. Lee P.</textarea></pre>
