&gt; //[[[SCP-5952|Blessed is the Father, God of the Universe, who stands firm against the unclean hordes. Blessed is the Son, righteous in suffering, who watches over the calf in the abattoir and the goat in the clutches of the unbaptized butcher. Blessed is the Holy Spirit, all-encompassing, proof of God&#39;s Love and watchfulness. Righteous is His Scarlet Angel, Saint of Saints, who wages war against the Hellish Seed of Cain and Abel through the careful meting of God&#39;s Love.]]]//

&gt; //[[[a-dove-in-a-chicken-pen|Father, we ask that your boundless Love cleanse this wicked world of Sin&#39;s frost. Burn the Canaanite whores out of their wicked burrows, that we may dash them upon the rocks and build our glorious paradise of Blood and Basalt.]]]//

&gt; //[[[SCP-3178|Jesus of Nazareth, Son of God and Blood of Daevon, we are eternally grateful for your Sacrifice of Sacrifices; for you have laid bare the evils of Canaan, their demons of clay and flesh, and the degenerated charlatans who steal our blood for their four-armed demon. We faithful affirm: your Sacrifice will not be in vain.]]]//

&gt; //[[[irregularity-proposal-2001-489|Holy Spirit, hear our prayer: we pray you find your way into the hearts and minds of the ignorant flock, that they may know your glory, that they may keep pure, that they may ensure their family&#39;s place in Basalt streets of the coming Paradise. It is you who makes the Father&#39;s miracle&#39;s manifest, who beats back the corrupting miasma blown over us by the vile Serpent. For your all-consuming love, we faithful are forever in your debt.]]]//

&gt; //[[[SCP-4370|Righteous Angel, made eunuch by the blades of Canaan, lead the flock to righteousness. Your boneless benevolence is the guiding star of the True Children of Israel. Let not their half-breed Antichrist rise from his tomb to devour the world once more. We know you shall not fail us, for through God, all things are possible.]]]//

&gt; //[[[christ-in-scarlet|Amen.]]]//</textarea></pre>
