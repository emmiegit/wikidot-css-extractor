**Special Containment Procedures:** All available supplies of SCP-5043 are kept in a climate-controlled storage area at Site-120. Testing of SCP-5043 requires Level 4 authorization, and is to be conducted at a blast-proof testing chamber or an approved Foundation bomb range.

**Description:** SCP-5043 refers to a bottle of anomalous pharmaceutical tablets and various other small objects, labeled &#34;//dado&#39;s//[[footnote]]A Person of Interest practicing para-pharmacology, believed to be responsible for the creation of SCP-5043 due to association[[/footnote]] //brainexplsoesenotsrsogsgsdgkpskplsdhpsd, ...uh, the... do, the make the your brains have a blow splosion//&#34; [sic]. SCP-5043 is packaged in a mundane plastic vitamin bottle, which has been taped over with a crudely-drawn label.

Three seconds after consuming SCP-5043, the subject&#39;s head will explode at a force comparable to one (1) kilogram of TNT. Once this has occurred, the resultant viscera will display minor attraction towards the subject&#39;s torso, accelerating towards it at 0.03 m/s . If not restrained, the subject&#39;s viscera will eventually group together at the exposed neck and reform into a living, fully functioning head. The memories and personalities of subjects remain largely intact.

Subjects undergoing the effects of SCP-5043 have reported varied experiences. Of the 20 individuals tested so far, 7 have reported total unconsciousness. 5 have reported their sensory input and cognitive functions to be reduced commensurate to that of REM-sleep. 4 have reported the experience to be exhilarating, some having likened it to usage of narcotics. The remaining 4 have reported SCP-5043&#39;s effects as painful, confusing and/or frightening.

SCP-5043 contains a secondary, infohazardous anomaly. Subjects attempting to speak the words &#34;dado&#39;s brain explosion&#34; or a variety thereof, will momentarily trail off into nonsensical babble. This effect will only occur when used in reference to SCP-5043.

SCP-5043 was discovered on March 10th 2020, when it was delivered unnoticed to a Foundation front company in New York City. SCP-5043 was brought to Site-120 for testing and storage.

**Addendum SCP-5043-1:** Packaging of SCP-5043

While the packaging of SCP-5043 is itself non-anomalous, it was brought under scrutiny in an attempt to gauge more information about the individual known as &#34;dado&#34;. The following points of interest were considered particularly noteworthy:

* In addition to pharmaceutical tablets, the packaging also contained various vitamin tablets, candies, nonpareils, uncooked rice, allspice and paperclips, all displaying identical anomalous properties.
* SCP-5043&#39;s bottle was originally for non-anomalous vitamin D supplements.
* The bottle&#39;s label is affixed with consumer-grade masking tape.
* The label&#39;s product information is written with a pencil. On the backside is a crudely-drawn insignia resembling an FDA approval stamp, made with a red crayon.
* The label itself was originally a receipt for toast, lactose-free milk, chicken nuggets, margarine, grapes, hamster feed and two packets of AA batteries, bought at Walmart Macroplaza in Baja California, Mexico on 11/12/2019.
* The adverse side of the label contains the phrases &#34;dado&#39;s mind wipe&#34;, &#34;mental break down by dado&#34;, &#34;dado&#39;s mental break down&#34; and &#34;dado&#39;s brain splosion&#34; written with a pen.
* Attached to SCP-5043 was also a slightly crumpled letter, purportedly written by dado, stating that SCP-5043 is a &#39;test bach&#39; [sic]. It also contains a lengthy, sporadic and likely exaggerated account of running a failing business, financial problems, political persecution and mental instability, eventually trailing off into non-sequitur descriptions of various currently-airing TV shows. Due to extremely low legibility, the contents of said letter have not been transcribed.
* Neither SCP-5043 nor any recovered supplementary material contains fingerprints or DNA.
