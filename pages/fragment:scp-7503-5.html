**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-7503 is to be contained in Site-48, where no working personnel belongs to the Buddhist Faith[[footnote]] For the purpose of this file, the term &#34;Buddhist individual&#34; or &#34;member of the Buddhist Faith&#34; refer to anyone who has accepted the Five Precepts and the Triple Gems of Buddhism. [[/footnote]]. SCP-7503 is to be kept inside a standard reinforced storage container at the center of a standard 10 x 10 meters squared cell. Under no circumstances should a member of the Buddhist Faith be allowed within a 5-meter radius of  SCP-7503. At least two armed non-Buddhist security personnel should always be guarding  SCP-7503.

Any Buddhist individual that has been in proximity closer than 10 meters of  SCP-7503 should be given immediate amnestic treatment and kept in observation for a period of two weeks.  If despite treatment they still present signs of being affected by SCP-7503, they should be kept under Foundation&#39;s detention with maximum security for human-level threats within a Foundation Site other than Site-77.  

SCP-7503-2 is currently being contained by the Buddhist branch of the Samsara Initiative.[[footnote]] GOI dedicated to the protection of the Dharmic Religions against the anomalous. The Buddhist branch is led by the Path of Certain Truths. [[/footnote]]  Due to possible information compromise in case of an SCP-7503 containment breach, it was deemed necessary for the Foundation to not be aware of any information regarding the location and containment procedures of SCP-7503-2.

**Description:**

SCP-7503 refers to the mummified remains of an unidentified male dressed in Buddhist monk garments. Archeological assessment of SCP-7503 indicates the clothing and ornaments date back to the 16th century, while the skeletal remains are older, estimated circa before the 3rd century. The Archeology Department has hypothesized SCP-7503 to be one of the  &#34;Sokushinbutsu&#34;.[[footnote]] Flesh body bodhisattvas or living buddhas: the bodies of Buddhist monks and nuns that underwent a process of self-mummification.[[/footnote]]

SCP-7503 &#39;s anomalous effect triggers when a member of the Buddhist Faith is within a radius of 5 meters from it. After 10 minutes of proximity to SCP-7503, around 10% of Buddhists will become devoted to SCP-7503 and venerate it as a &#34;Buddha&#34;. After 1 hour, this percentage raises to 100%. Regardless of previous religiosity, they display a fanatical commitment to SCP-7503, declaring it to be the true representative of the Buddhist Faith. They will also express an intent to help SCP-7503 in reclaiming the Potala Palace[[footnote]] Ancestral residence of the Dalai Lama since the 7th century.[[/footnote]] in Lhasa, even if by use of violence. To this date, there have been no records of aggressions against Potala related to SCP-7503 .

The only known method to prevent SCP-7503&#39;s influence over a susceptible individual is immediate amnestic treatment after exposure. Missing this treatment, SCP-7503&#39;s effect is presumed to be permanent. Due to fanatic behavior displayed by influenced individuals and the high risk posed by an SCP-7503&#39;s containment breach, the Ethics Committee is considering whether termination should be an option if first-line amnestic treatment fails.

In addition, individuals affected by SCP-7503 individuals will become obsessed with reuniting SCP-7503 with SCP-7503-2.  SCP-7503-2 is a 6-meter tall mechanical construct, resembling a suit of 16th-century Chinese armor, albeit with distorted proportions.  Its exterior is composed of an unidentified golden metal of remarkable durability. This durability is likely anomalous in nature; since SCP-7503-2 is capable of withstanding modern heavy fire and artillery without suffering apparent damage.

Internally, it possesses a complex clockwork mechanism allowing it to move. This mechanism does not require an external power source in order to function. SCP-7503-2 is armed with several weapons including both medieval bladed and blunt weaponry as well as anachronistic ones such as Gatling-type guns, flame throwers, and rocket launchers.  The Samsara Initiative is currently investigating SCP-7503-2&#39;s advanced weaponry, evidence pointing it to be anomalous in nature.

SCP-7503-2 is not capable of autonomous behavior, instead, it possesses a hatch to a compartment. It will remain completely dormant until SCP-7503  is placed inside of it. The Samsara Initiative has reported it will not activate with any other material, pending further testing. Individuals under SCP-7503&#39;s influence will try to place SCP-7503  in SCP-7503-2. This will, in turn, give SCP-7503 control over  SCP-7503-2. When inside SCP-7503-2, SCP-7503 is capable of vocal communication through unknown means.

**Discovery Log:**

SCP-7503 and SCP-7503 -2 were discovered during an archeological excavation in a monastery near  Shiquanhe, Tibet.  They were located within meters of each other, in a previously uncharted chamber. Upon discovery, members of the archeological team came under the influence of SCP-7503. They placed SCP-7503 into SCP-7503-2, activating it. SCP-7503 emerged from the excavation site and began marching toward Lhasa.

Upon being informed of the SCP-7503 advances, the Samsara Initiative activated Protocol Mucalinda, designed to protect the Dalai Lama from anomalous threats. His Holiness ██████ ██████ was secured in a bunker, while the Samsara Initiative deployed the full strength of Project Qiang[[footnote]]  Samsara Initiative’s combat forces. [[/footnote]] against SCP-7503, as well as the combined forces of the Gurkha Guard, the Sovereign Sohei International Corps, the National Revolutionary Army, and Airforce, as well as the Indo-Tibetan Border Police. The Foundation was also notified and assistance was requested. MTF Nu-7 &#34;Hammer Down&#34; was deployed as a response. Chinese Airforce planes bombarded SCP-7503, while ground forces mounted a fortified perimeter around Shiquanhe to stop SCP-7503 from reaching Lhasa. While proving to be highly resistant to damage from modern military weaponry, the continuous fire from both ground and aerial forces managed to stall SCP-7503&#39;s advancement until the arrival of Foundation reinforcement. Foundation airforces managed to incapacitate SCP-7503-2 with plasma cannons bombardment, allowing MTF Nu-7 members to approach it and remove SCP-7503, nullifying the threat.  A large-scale cover-up operation involving misinformation and mass amnestic application was conducted in the aftermath of the incident.
