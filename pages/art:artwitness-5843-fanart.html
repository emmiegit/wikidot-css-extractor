**__Artist&#39;s Commentary__**

&gt; **What I Can Give:** Simple traditional art, but I can’t do humanoids or any complicated shit, so sorry ‘bout that.

--Liar.--

To be fair, this piece isn&#39;t the //most// complicated drawing I&#39;ve done, but it sure isn&#39;t the most simple either. I was originally going to sketch the piece, but when I received my assigned giftee, I knew I couldn&#39;t do that anymore. That is because they have already seen some of my drawings in the past on my artwork page (link below lol), so they would immediately recognize it if I just simply drew it with a pen and pencil. And so, I resorted to paint it.

I&#39;m an amateur at best when it comes to painting, so I had to give 110% of what I would normally be capable of doing. Safe to say it came out pretty well, and they enjoyed it. Whether they knew I was their gifter, I&#39;m not sure. I hope they didn&#39;t connect the dots.

Speaking of which, I had my guess with who drew //[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/683327170730393634/921671026495062046/calca0.jpg my]// [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/683327170730393634/921671026750939156/calca1.png three] [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/683327170730393634/921671026297962537/calca2.png presents,] and after the reveal, it turned out I was right. Pretty cool, if I do say so myself (Check out their [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/rigen-vectors artwork page] as well!).

This was also my first ever Art Exchange in the community, and I&#39;m glad to be a part of this event. Massive props to [[*user Elenee FishTruck]] and [[*user DarkStuff]] for setting this up. Glad to be capable of contributing to this. Can&#39;t wait for next year!
