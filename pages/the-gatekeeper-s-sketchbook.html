//What appears to be an older, completed sketchbook sits on the table in front of you. The ink stains that tarnish the cover tell you that it&#39;s been well loved over the years. A quick flip through of the pages confirms your thoughts - every page is filled to the brim with art. Looks like the artist has written some commentary on each of the pieces as well. Perhaps you take a closer look inside? There&#39;s no need to hurry, the artist has to have moved on to a new sketchbook by now.//

Heya, if you&#39;ve found this sketchbook, congrats, you&#39;ve found the completed collection of all my works over my years here at the Library. There&#39;s no need to return it to me anymore - the majority of the art is very old now, and this chapter in my art journey closed.  When I start a new sketchbook, I&#39;ll leave a summoning sign here between the pages, but otherwise, enjoy this old collection.

--Heya, if you&#39;ve found this sketchbook, congrats, I managed to lose track of it once again. Be real helpful if you could return it to me, the Gatekeeper, or uh, whatever name I&#39;ve managed to pick up here in the Library.  If you see a [*https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/field-guide-to-the-shelves-volume-one#toc7 weird canine with a mask for a face], give it to him, as he&#39;ll make sure it gets back to me.--

Regardless of that though, you&#39;re probably wondering what this is, other than a sketchbook of course. Well, I&#39;ve found in my years of traveling, documenting the things you&#39;ve seen and making note of them can be a handy resource in the future. A book and pencil require no special equipment and no further processing, you just have to be able to draw quickly, so that&#39;s what I&#39;ve decided to do. Quickly note down all the things I&#39;ve seen.

If you have come across something you&#39;d like documented in this sketchbook, please take a copy of whatever book, manuscript, film, ect it appears in and place it in the sketchbook or hand it to the masked canine when returning the book. Perhaps when the book gets back to me again, I&#39;ll make the time to note down whatever you&#39;ve added. Otherwise, if you&#39;re just here to snoop, go right ahead I guess, just don&#39;t draw over my drawings or spill anything on them, thanks.

Right, let&#39;s see. Would probably be best to start with the creatures currently residing in the place I&#39;m staying at - The Library. These entities have the ranks of staff here, running the place and keeping everything in check. I gave them quite a startle when I first joined, but I think we&#39;re now on good terms. Well, at least, I hope we&#39;re on good terms. 

I&#39;ve taken to drawing them from up in the rafters while they go about their daily tasks. There is quite the variety of them, despite there only being three sort of &#34;classes&#34; or &#34;ranks&#34; they seem to be apart of. I&#39;m not sure why this is, but I speculate it&#39;s because the Library is so vast with so many different sections, they need different adaptations to cope with the staffing needs in the various sections.

I&#39;ve found that there are also other &#34;staff&#34; figures that crop up from time to time - volunteers as they&#39;re most commonly known, but these three that I&#39;ve listed below are the &#34;main&#34; three and are consistent throughout all ages and halls of the Library.

------
++ **Studies on the Docents:**
[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/wanderers-library-hub/WL_Docents_UC.png]]
The Docents are the main foot-staff of the Library. Typically with a lantern for one limb and a lack of a mouth, they act as silent protectors and guides throughout the Library. They can be asked for directions, and will lead you to various sections of the Library, but at the first sign of trouble, they&#39;re the last thing you want to see should you be the perpetrator. 
[[collapsible show=&#34; + They call them Docents&#34; hide=&#34;- lamp&#34;]]

There&#39;s a lot of these fellas wandering the hallways of this library. This one approached me when it saw I was drawing in this notebook. It seemed angry at first, perhaps because it thought I was drawing in a Library book? Well, either way, once it realized it was indeed my book and not one of its own, it simply watched for a bit, curious. Then it wandered off, leaving me alone in the dark.

They lost their right to speak and most slowly earn it back by doing various tasks for the Library. I wonder if they&#39;re even capable of feeling guilt anymore. I feel as if there&#39;s a darker aspect to the Library we aren&#39;t being shown, or perhaps, folks are turning a blind eye to instead.
[[/collapsible]]
------
++ **Studies on the Pages:**
[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/wanderers-library-hub/WL_Pages_UC.png]]
The Pages handle the shelving and fetching of books in the Library. With multiple limbs and multiple eyes, they are skilled at climbing the endless shelves and fetching whatever book you need. When not fetching books, they take new entries and shelve them, or help reorganize when new wings of the Library become accessible for patrons. They can talk, given that unlike Docents they do have mouths, but they tend to be creatures of very few words. Pleasant to be around though - there are quite a few of them who live nearby me in the rafters.

I heard these fellas skittering around, but didn&#39;t actually see one until recently. They remind me of spiders, or maybe ants, well, some sort of insect creature thing. While they do seem nice, I don&#39;t really want to get scooped up by one.

This friendly Page has helped me out on several occasions, mostly by returning my sketchbook to me when I&#39;ve dropped it from the rafters or by helping me find a safe spot to sit. I&#39;ve seen them reading a lot, helping give feedback on whatever projects Patrons are working on. I wish them the best.

I haven&#39;t learned this Page&#39;s name, but I&#39;ve found them near the main desks, saying hello to all the new Patrons as they come and go. They said hello to me when I went down to the market area to get some new bandages despite me not being super new, but I appreciated their help carrying stuff back up to my spot in the rafters.

The Library isn&#39;t always as cheerful as it seems. Caught this fella mid transformation into staff, then again later once he was fully transformed. Don&#39;t know what he did that was a violation of Library rules, but I hope I don&#39;t meet the same fate as him.

++ **Studies on the Archivists:**
[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/wanderers-library-hub/WL_Archivists_UC.png]]
Archivists have the greatest variety in appearances. I&#39;ve categorized them into three sub categories - settled, roaming, and chief. The original Archivists - those found in the oldest documents, are a kind of settled Archivist. They stay at their assigned desk and don&#39;t roam. Roaming have a lot more variety and are the next step up - they can leave their desks and, as the name suggests, roam the Library. The chief is the final and highest rank, and there is only ever one appointed at a time. It handles the largest issues, and could be considered head staff.

Regardless of how they move, all Archivists handle record-keeping and administrative business - such as recording of Ways, handing out of Library cards, and handling of disputes.

[[collapsible show=&#34; + They call them Archivists&#34; hide=&#34;- they hate one another&#34;]]

The last of the Library staff, at least, for now I think. These two seem to be stuck together as desk mates and absolutely despise one another because of it. Or, at least, the hand guy seems to despise it. I don&#39;t know about the uh, owl centipede..? Seems it just wants to play. I&#39;ve learned their names are Ayman and Owlpede, respectively.

They call him Rounderpede. I&#39;m not sure why he has a shoe on his desk or what his deal really is, but he&#39;s certainly not as scary as everyone keeps making him out to be. Well, then again, I&#39;m used to talking to the Bridge Watcher back home, another giant centipede creature, so maybe I&#39;m just used to bugs while most folks aren&#39;t, lol. Either way, he seems like a nice guy.

I think this was the Archivist who gave me my Library card, but I&#39;m not totally sure. I was more perplexed by how they stay hydrated while being out of water. I think it might be due to all the booze they drink, but I&#39;d rather not investigate that any further than I need to.

A new wing has opened up in the Library! The books went in without any issue, but it seems the Archivists are having an argument over the interior decoration. According to the local pages in the area, this is nothing new.

**Studies on the Serpent:**
The Serpent is something I consider more a creature of legend than something that still physically inhabits the Library. I don&#39;t doubt it&#39;s still here in spirit - a part of its essence made the Library after all - but in my eyes it does not play as big of an impact here as it once did.

Well, it&#39;d be a shame to come to a library and just, not read anything, so, instead of only hiding out and drawing I did manage to snag a few books to read. Whoever these authors are tend to be quite talented, and I&#39;ve enjoyed drawing things from their works. It&#39;s important to document things from all realities, so again, if you have something you want documented, please send it my way. Thanks.

The circle cult harassed me day in and day out until I made them art of an earlier form of their god. They&#39;ve been squandering with me over Library territory. Guess they won this round.

An old friend of mine. Wasn&#39;t expecting to see him here within the Library. I should probably go say hello when he isn&#39;t busy.

This book was passed along to me and I felt inclined to add some minor illustrations. I was surprised to find a reference to Uncertainty, but I&#39;m not surprised to find he&#39;s been quite the ass to other patrons. He ended up in the Library with me and often I send him out to fetch things for me, mostly this sketchbook, but I hadn&#39;t realized he had been quite vocal in his process about actually //getting// the sketchbook back to me. I&#39;ll have to discuss this with him later.

Out of all the Library Patrons, it seems this one&#39;s bird has gotten the closest to finding me up the rafters. Perhaps I should introduce myself before I give him or his bird a fright.

Let&#39;s just say I skedaddled out of there before finding out what happened to that mischievous skeleton. Knowing his luck though, I&#39;m sure he made it out alright. At least, I hope so.

These birds are very helpful around the Library, albeit sometimes slightly mischievous.

A fellow traveler who also documents his findings, just like I do. I wish him the best of luck with his work. I sketched this during one of his brief stops in the Library.

These were technically taken from the collection of my works Basar curates, but, they seemed relevant enough to share here as well. This takes place in another timeline, far in the future, where the Library itself has begun to die.
