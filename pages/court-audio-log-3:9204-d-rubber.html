WRITTEN BY SUPERVISOR. __SOUTH__ [INTERNAL TRIBUNES DEPARTMENT - RAISA]

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ SUBMIT CLEARANCE AS RAISA AGENT.&#34; hide=&#34;- ACCESS GRANTED&#34;]]
&lt;LOG START&gt;
AREA CODE (S-3)
DETAILS/DESCRIPTION (WRITTEN):
The courtroom is silent, ethics committee agents sitting on pews, faces and bodies covered by the tinted glass. A judge from the ITD standing in the front.
 On the sides, guards stand silently, golden visors shining in the shitty LED. 

Then, a guard shouts &#34;ATTENTION!&#34;, alerting everybody. &#34;Please stay seated and come to order. Further conversation will not be tolerated. The Honorable Judge █████ presiding.&#34;

Every man and woman stops their conversations and starts paying attention.

The judge starts talking, stating &#34;First case of the day, gentlemen. Date, 07/02/2023. Day after Canada day. Starting the case of Doctor Rubber, Clearance level 1, Scientist. Reminder, As jurors you are not to be swayed by sympathy. Would the counsel for Dr. Rubber please rise?&#34;

Doctor Rubbers&#39; counsel stands up. 

&#34;Counsel, lay a foundation. Please.&#34;

&#34;Doctor Rubber has been found guilty for unauthorized edits to an anomalies file. This is his second time, and has been found guilty as well for leaking foundation documents to the general public. 120 liters of Class-C amnestics have been used. &#34;

&#34;Defense?&#34;

&#34;Defense lays no objection to the foundation.&#34;

Doctor Rubber leans over, whispering something to the defense.
&#34;...Man, just please say something to somewhat validate my decisions.&#34;

&#34;...However, as defense, I would like to state Doctor Rubber has reasons for this decision.&#34;

The judge calls the Doctor to the stand, Dr. Rubber&#39; walking slowly to the stand.

&#34;I would like to say, I&#39;ve been uhh.. using the money to assist the foundation! And I only changed some parts of it!&#34;

&#34;Prosecution, any objections?&#34;

The prosecutor stands up.
&#34;We&#39;ve found evidence that the defense has not been sending any money to the foundation. This is display A.&#34; 

Display A is shown, Dr. Rubbers&#39; financial information. No withdrawals. There has been no traces of giving the cash to anybody.

The prosecutor speaks up, again.
&#34;And, according to RAISA complaint 29-3, and 31-4 which is shown currently, you changed roughly half of the documents. Can I tell you how many posters of this we have around?&#34;
The prosecutor was talking about the poster, shown as display B.

[[https://i.etsystatic.com/30793990/r/il/d75b9d/4035939023/il_794xN.4035939023_q3uu.jpg]]
Picture of display B.

And, following the showing of display B, a projection of the complaints is shown.

The judge speaks up.
&#34;However, this is getting more irrelevant, Jurors has been shown all relevant documents, and thus should start discussing the punishment.&#34;

The Jurors finish discussing after 1 hour.

&#34;The Jurors came to a decision. Doctor Rubber&#39;s sentenced to 100 tours of janitorial duty in the washrooms, a $100,000, fine, and being placed as a Class-E for 2 days.&#34;
