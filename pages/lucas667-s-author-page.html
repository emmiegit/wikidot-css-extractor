Hello and welcome to my Author Page! --//Woah, I never thought I would be able to write 3 successful articles tbh, but somehow I did, I&#39;m kinda proud of myself for this.//--

------

[[size 150%]]Here&#39;s a quick summary about me:[[/size]]

My name is Lucas, I am a brazilian guy who was born in 1996, and honestly, my english knowledge is not the greatest, however, it&#39;s apparently decent enough to write some stuff here! I have been into SCPs and creepypastas since my teenage, although I&#39;ve not read them much during the last 5 or 6 years. Bizarre and weird stuff has always fascinated me (--because I&#39;m a weirdo--), and I especially love Series 1 articles, probably because they were simpler but still had a different feeling of mystery that nowadays just isn&#39;t the same imo (not complaining here, I also like several articles from the other series, but Series 1 definitely remain as my favorite for now).

Maybe it&#39;s just because those articles are part of my past, from the times I used to believe these anomalous things could //maybe// be real and they legit used to scare me, as I was reading random translated versions of them within random brazilian creepypasta websites. My favorite one? Most likely [[[SCP-035]]]. I don&#39;t have a specific reason why, but that mask just fascinates me a lot lol. Also, I have to admit that I enjoy simple concepts and shorter SCPs more than long and too complex ones. I think that&#39;s mainly because my general knowledge of things is pretty limited. Besides reading and now writing SCPs, here are some other things I like --to waste my time with:--

* **Animes** (Especially One Piece and Bleach. I also really love the manga Kingdom. I even used to work as a curator for the One Piece Amino community, you can easily find me there just searching for the username &#34;Lucas&#34;.)
 
* **Music** (I especially like j-rock, rock, and metal, but I also enjoy some more popular artists, like for example Rihanna, Avril Lavigne, and Alan Walker. Favorite band is easily Dir en grey, definitely check them out! They&#39;re criminally underrated. Here is one of my favorite songs by them: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8ofitxZM7c Rinkaku]. Other bands I like a lot are: Asian Kung-Fu Generation, X Japan, One OK Rock, Babymetal, Linkin Park, Evanescence, Tool, Poets of the Fall and many more.)

* **Gaming** (Especially old games. My favorite game is Tibia, an MMORPG made in 1997 that is kinda popular in my country.)

* **Movies** (Favorite movie is probably The Godfather 2, it&#39;s truly a masterpiece!)

Oh and yeah, I was almost forgetting but I&#39;m also the founder of the current Foundation&#39;s [http://scp-pt-br.wikidot.com Lusophone Branch], and although I haven&#39;t been very active over there recently, I am happy that I was able to be part of its creation, and its current active members are doing an incredible job!
 
So yeah, that&#39;s all for now, but maybe I will add more things here in the future. Hope you enjoyed learning a little bit more about me!

I think I already wrote too much about myself here, so below I will leave the --small-- list of my articles. Please read them if you haven&#39;t yet and let me know your thoughts in their comment sections! Also, feel free to PM me if you want to tell or ask me anything, as you probably won&#39;t see me often in the chats. Thanks for reading and have a nice day!

As you guys can see, all of my articles have a relatively low rating, so my main goal here currently is to write one that gets to at least +50!</textarea></pre>
