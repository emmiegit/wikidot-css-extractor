**Description:** SCP-2718-J, formerly known as [[[SCP-2317]]], is a wooden door and frame that leads to an extradimensional salt flat. Following the presumed neutralization of SCP-2317-K after a strongly-worded letter, SCP-2718-J has been used to build an extradimensional resort facility for the permanent containment and comfort of qualified dead bodies.

Due to [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2718 recent revelations] about the afterlife/lack thereof, the necessity of a means to create an artificial afterlife for self-aware corpses can no longer be ignored. SCP-2718-J, known[[footnote]] Depending on the structural integrity of individual eardrums.
