**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to SCP-7456&#39;s nature, it cannot be contained within a secure facility. Due to this, Mobile Task Forces [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces Iota-10 &#34;Damn Feds&#34;] and [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2446 Lambda-5 &#34;White Rabbits&#34;] are to set up and maintain a parameter of 50 meters around SCP-7456. Anyone caught breaching the parameter is to be detained and administered Class-C Amnestics. At no time should personnel enter SCP-7456 unless given permission by the Site Director, anyone entering SCP-7456 without appropriate clearance is to be considered MIA, and no search party is to be dispatched. 

Bi-weekly seismic scanning of the immediate area around SCP-7456 is to be conducted. If any connected water, gas, or electricity is found during scanning, Lambda-5 is to disconnect the lines immediately. Every 6 months personnel guarding SCP-7456 must pass a Cognitive Resistance Value test with a value of more than 15 or higher, any personnel with a value below this are to be immediately reassigned.

**Description:** SCP-7456 is a single-family home with three stories (basement, ground floor, attic), located in the town of ███████, North Dakota. SCP-7456 was originally owned by four individuals belonging to the ███████████ family, who are presumed dead. 

SCP-7456 exhibits anomalous properties upon entry, where subjects undergo an immediate dimensional shift, translocating to a non Euclidean reality within the confines of the structure, resembling additional floors. Although only eight distinct stages have been documented, it is suspected that the spatial extent of the house extends infinitely. During exploration involving oxygen detection equipment, it was observed that upon descent to a lower level, the ambient oxygen concentrations decrease by 2%, and background radiation increases.

SCP-7456-2 are dark, humanoid entities which display sentience, that are 3 meters tall with abnormally large claws, and abnormally stretched limbs. Each instance of 7456-2 has unique mutations or defects, as well as the ability to emit large amounts of body heat. 

SCP-7456-2 will stalk their prey and attempt to herd them to lower levels of SCP-7456. Methods of herding vary instance by instance but typically will be as follows:
-----
* Make sounds in the shifting zones to lure them into the area.
* Chasing them for brief periods towards shifting areas.
* Emitting body heat in a room to an extent where their prey will leave the room due to the heat.
-----

It is unknown what happens to victims of SCP-7456-2 instances, but it is presumed that they are subsequently killed and devoured, as evidenced by the audio recordings of missing Lambda-5 staff.

Each level of SCP-7456 is triggered via random means, (ex: Opening a cupboard, entering a random room, etc.) each level of SCP-7456 has a different layout and style of interior, such as rustic, modern, or apartment like rooms.

SCP-7456 came to the attention of the foundation on May 7th, 2023, after abnormal amounts of missing person reports were filed with the ███████ sheriff&#39;s department. Eleven people were reported missing during a party at the street address where SCP-7456 is located. On May 7th 2023; CCTV footage from the sheriff department captured seven guests arriving at SCP-7456. On May 10th, 2023. Audio captured by CCTV cameras picked up multiple screams coming from within the residence. 12 minutes later multiple 911 calls were received reporting the screams and requesting police and military (see __addendum-7456-2__ for call transcripts).  

Two sheriff deputies with body cams responded to the scene and attempted to enter SCP-7456 but were unable to access 7456 due to the door being blocked. (see __addendum-7456-3__ for body camera transcript)

On May 7th, 2023, at 6:33 AM, the ███████ sheriff&#39;s department, where I currently am stationed, received approximately 22-45 missing person reports for the residence of ███████████, in ███████, North Dakota. We believe that around 11 people are involved in this situation, but the potential escalation is a concern if the sheriff deputies intervene. Additionally, we received multiple 911 calls from distressed individuals reporting, &#39;Creatures are dragging them inside.&#39; Based on the 911 calls and missing person reports, I am requesting assistance from Epsilon-6 &#34;Village Idiots&#34;.
