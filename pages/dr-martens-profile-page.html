    caption=This is obviously not a picture of Dr. Martens. In fact, we&#39;re not sure why and how this picture is here[[footnote]] Though we suspect Dr. Martens placed it here. [[/footnote]].
]]

&gt; **Name:** Reese Blackwell Martens[[footnote]] Which may or may not be his real name. [[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **Security Clearance:** Level 2
&gt; 
&gt; **Occupation:** ERROR
&gt; 
&gt; **Profile:** Reese Martens was born in the year [DATA EXPUNGED]. After serving briefly in the [DATA EXPUNGED] Army, he joined the Foundation in the hopes of finding something to do wih his life. 
&gt; 
&gt; Reese Martens exists everywhere at once. Some reports claim that they&#39;ve seen him [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-273-j| trying to unfreeze a D-Class Personnel in Site-198,] others claim that he&#39;s going through [http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-world-was-silent| an infinite time loop in Site-60,] and others say that he&#39;s a [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4280| generally pleasant researcher working in Site-83,] and that&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg. And the thing is that all of those reports are true.
&gt; 
&gt; The truth about Reese Martens is that there is not just one version of him in the Foundation. There are over 100 of them working for the Foundation (To be precise, 118), either as janitors, members of the Ethics Committee or other available positions. Reports say that the reason why there&#39;s so many versions of him in the Foundation is due to an incident in 2005, where he [DATA EXPUNGED].
&gt; 
&gt; When they&#39;re not busy with work, all the versions of Dr. Martens enjoy listening to indie music, writing horror stories online, or playing video games.
&gt; 
&gt; Overall, they&#39;re all-round nice guys, so the next time you see them, make sure you say hello to them, or buy them a drink!

&gt; **Dr. Martens has done research on, or has been involved directly in the following projects:**
&gt; 
&gt; - [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-273-j| SCP-273-J] - It&#39;s Freezingly Good!
&gt; 
&gt; - [http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-world-was-silent| The World Was Silent] - It&#39;s all going to reset.
&gt; 
&gt; - [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4280| SCP-4280] - You [DATA EXPUNGED]!
&gt; 
&gt; - [http://www.scp-wiki.net/fifth-avenue| Fifth Avenue, please.] - It’s all a dream anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; - [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4635| SCP-4635] - Praise be to Asuzak.

&gt; **SCP-273-J:** 
&gt; 
&gt; - Ah, my first SCP. After weeks of trying and failing to publish a workable SCP, I came up with 273-J by accident, mostly from reading up on SCPs with extensive test logs, like 261, and thinking &#39;What if a person got frozen in place, but he was still alive?&#39; With the help of multiple critics, but mostly Zyn, who came in and helped me to edit my draft, I finally posted my first SCP on the site.
&gt; 
&gt; **The World Was Silent:**
&gt; 
&gt; - My magnum opus. I don&#39;t think I would ever publish anything as great as this for a long while. Silent was written, quite literally, in half an hour, when I was still in my writing frenzy following the posting of SCP-4861 (which unfortunately, got deleted). Silent was actually going to be a companion tale to 4861, but when I realised that 4861 was obviously not going to stay on the site, I modified the story, and changed the main theme from &#39;researcher&#39;s last day on the site&#39; to &#39;researcher in a time loop&#39;. Special thanks to RockTeethMothEyes and Tufto and a few others I asked on chat (Sorry, I forgot your names) for critiquing my draft!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4280:**
&gt; 
&gt; - Following the success of Silent, I moved on to two ideas I had: one about a camera that makes people disappear except for the photographer, and another about a swear jar. I chose the latter, mainly because I found it easier to write. The initial draft was intended to only track one researcher and observe his actions as he&#39;s charged by 4280, but I cut it out and shifted some elements of it to Dr. Gretka&#39;s log in the final product. Special thanks to a lot of people, most especially Zyn, RockTeethMothEyes, not_a_seagull, and Gishface for critique!

**__The Martens Committee&#39;s 18th Meeting__**

**Participants:** Martens-1, Martens-21, Martens-89

**Date of Meeting:** 11 August 2018

**Venue of Meeting:** Meeting Room 15, Site-45

**{Begin Recording, 0954 hours}**

**M-1:** What the? Why are there only two of you in the room? I thought I told everyone to come! Surely there should be more?

**M-21:** Martens-17, 34, 56, 74, and 109 are missing from their designated Sites, Martens-3, 8, 14, and 45 are dead, Martens-2 is still trying to unfreeze the D-Class Personnel in Site-198, Martens-67 is still stuck in the time loop, Martens-76, 88, 91, and 107 are currently exploring a new anomaly, Martens-24 is fighting a containment breach as of this moment, Martens-54 is on guard duty, Martens-5 has been contained under suspicion of being an anomaly, and the status of the others are still unknown.

**M-1:** //(Sighs)// Well, let&#39;s make this meeting shorter then, since there&#39;s no one here. What&#39;s the news, Martens-89?

**M-89:** Over the past week, the committee has successfully added a new anomaly entry to the database, submitted a petition to the Council to request that a new MTF solely comprised of committee members be formed, and decided on where to eat for tomorrow&#39;s dinner.

**M-1:** Good.

**M-21:** If I may interject, has the committee really only added one anomaly entry to the database? There are over 100 of us! Surely there would be more?

**M-1:** It can&#39;t be helped. Some of the anomalies we have recorded over the past week have been proven to be non-existent, and hence the council has removed our documentation on these anomalies.

**M-89:** Yeah, and with that many researchers all researching on potential anomalies, it&#39;s pretty hard to find more. So, just be thankful that we managed to find and document one anomaly, Martens-21.

**M-21:** Alright. //(After a few minutes of silence)// Man, it&#39;s so dull! Why can&#39;t Martens-65 have come? He&#39;s always the life of the party!

**M-89:** Yeah, remember his parody of Dr. Hal during the last meeting?

**M-21:** //(Poorly imitating Martens-65 imitiating Dr. Hal)// &#39;How many times have I told you guys to not call me Hal-9000?&#39;

//(Both Martens-21 and Martens-89 laugh)//

**M-89:** Ooh, try to imitate Dr. Koi!

**M-21:** //(Poorly imitating Dr. Koi)// &#39;No, I&#39;m not a fish, so don&#39;t push me into the pool and expect me to swim!&#39;

//(Both Martens-21 and Martens-89 laugh)//

**M-1:** //(Sighs)// Since there&#39;s nothing else on the agenda, I guess the meeting is adjourned. Martens-21, please try not to imitate other researchers in front of them. Martens-89, keep me updated on any new developments on the committee. Got it?

**M-21, M-89:** //(Still Laughing)// Got it.

**M-1:** Meeting adjourned.

**{End Recording, 1030 hours}**
