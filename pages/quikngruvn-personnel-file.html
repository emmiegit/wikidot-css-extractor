**Name:** Quikngruvn Halifax

**Security Clearance Level:** 3

**Position:** Archivist

**Duties:** Proofread, edit, maintain, and update archived documents and media related to SCPs; data security, backup, and disaster recovery

**Location:** Site-19, other sites as needed

**Education:** B.S. Information Science, B.S. Mathematics, 19██, University of [REDACTED]; M.S. Information Science, 19██, University of [REDACTED]

**Biography:** Mr. Halifax was recruited straight out of graduate school by the Foundation at a job fair in [REDACTED] and was offered a position as a staff archivist. In addition to adding, expanding, revising, and updating numerous primary and secondary SCP-related documents, he has also helped develop and implement data redundancy and disaster-recovery protocols across multiple sites.

**Personal:** Mr. Halifax lives by the credo, &#34;A place for everything, and everything in its place.&#34; He is anal-retentive about organization almost to the point of compulsion, keeping himself and his office freakishly tidy, uncluttered, and well-organized.

Mr. Halifax tends to spend long hours in his office working on documentation, with his office sound system blaring most any type of music at high volume. Visitors are advised to ring the doorbell to his office, as knocking will most likely not be noticed.

&gt; **Excerpt from Interview █████████**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███████:** Now, Mr. Halifax, about your name...
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. Halifax:** Mmm-hmmm.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███████:** How, exactly, did—
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. Halifax:** Hippies.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███████:** I’m sorry?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. Halifax:** My parents were hippies.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███████:** Ah. So what, um, what does your name mean?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. Halifax:** It means that my parents were stoned out of their gourd when I was born. And when I was conceived. And the whole time before, during, and after!

&gt; **&#34;Minor clean-up&#34;:** Articles marked with &#34;Minor clean-up&#34; have been edited for spelling, grammar, syntax, sentence structure, formatting, clarity, flow, clinical feel, and standardized measurements. For these edits, I try to keep the content and tone just as I found them, and just polish the original author’s work a bit. Significant changes in content and/or tone should be marked as a revision.
&gt; 
&gt; **Addendum:** I don&#39;t use &#34;Minor clean-up&#34; anymore, instead being more specific about what changes I make, but for the however many edits I //did// mark with &#34;Minor clean-up&#34;, the above still applies. --Quikngruvn
