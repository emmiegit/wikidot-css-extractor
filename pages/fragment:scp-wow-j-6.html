**Item #:** SCP-WOW-J

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-WOW-J is to be stored in a standard animal containment cell in Site-808. Despite the instructions of Researcher Carlson, under no circumstances is SCP-WOW-J to be taught how to play the mandolin. SCP-WOW-J is to be fed a standard tropical diet of fruits and nuts, and is also allowed to roam freely around its containment cell. However, no Foundation employee is to feed SCP-WOW-J after midnight, no matter how nicely it asks. Additionally, Staff are to be reminded once weekly that SCP-WOW-J is not friends with Dr. Clef, no matter how many times it claims otherwise. 

In case of a containment [[footnote]] A containment breach denotes a time when an anomaly decides to steal the money of every researcher at a site. [[/footnote]] breach no fewer than 47 Psittacus erithacus (--grey parrot-- gray parrot) trained in BSL (British Sign Language) must be released in Site-808 to mitigate adverse psychological effects on personnel.

**Description:** SCP-WOW-J is a female instance of Aratinga solstitialis (Sun parakeet). Additionally, SCP-WOW-J is a top-notch keyboard player and will definitely beat you at the keyboard should one choose to challenge it to a keyboard, which one is //not// advised to do. According to medical reports, reportedly SCP-WOW-J is made entirely of crystallized sadness. SCP-WOW-J is currently capable of several anomalies, all listed below:
* Convincing Foundation personnel that it is a human female, and not a Sun parakeet
* Making friends with Dr. Clef
* When touched by an adult woman, SCP-WOW-J glows a bright pink. When touched by a child or adult man, it retains its normal color, but begins to emit a loud wailing, similar to a howler monkey. 
* In the event that SCP-WOW-J is ever fed after midnight, all living things within a five meter radius around the containment zone will be instantly transmuted into tapioca pudding.

SCP-WOW-J was discovered at the San Diego Zoo, reportedly flying with a security guard and asking about her lost child. A Foundation agent present at the zoo brought SCP-WOW-J in for questioning, before SCP-WOW-J nearly convinced Agent Kabasic that she had been making a mistake.

**Addendum SCP-WOW-J-1:**

&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-WOW-J
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Researcher Carlson
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; ##white|please i swear please let me die##
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** How is your day so far, Mrs. Vernon?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-WOW-J:** It is going well so far! Thank you Mr. Carlson. I’m trying to write a new sonata!
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Oh, really! Cool! What’s it going to be for?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-WOW-J:** Hear me out. I’m going to write it… for the mandolin!
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** The mandolin? That sounds exciting!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-WOW-J:** Have you ever heard the song &#34;Puttin&#39; on the Ritz&#34; by Taco? You know, the one that goes: &#39;If you&#39;re blue and you don&#39;t know where to go to why don&#39;t you go where fashion sits, puttin&#39; on the Ritz!&#39; That one.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Indeed, I have.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-WOW-J:** So, it’s going to sound kinda like that. I really like that song, it’s one of my favorites!
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** No way! That’s one of my favorites, too! 
&gt;  //[ Both Researcher Kinney and SCP-WOW-J laughs. ]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-WOW-J:** You guys have got me on a real deal here. Free food, recreation, and plenty of room to move around!
&gt; 
&gt; //[ SCP-WOW-J flies around for a short duration. ]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Hey, hey, no need to get all excited! Here’s the deal, I’ll be back. Why don’t I grab some coffee on the way in, huh? Does that sound good?
&gt; 
&gt; //[ SCP-WOW-J chirps repeatedly. ]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-WOW-J:** Sure does!
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Researcher Kinney was chastised for gross misconduct. SCP-WOW-J is not allowed to see Researcher Kinney, despite protests from both parties. 

**Addendum SCP-WOW-J-2:** Additionally, in response to these events, SCP-WOW-J is only to be stored in a standard humanoid containment cell. To provide some amusement, 100 mg of unsalted popcorn is to be crushed and dissolved in 1 Liter of distilled water and administered twice a month to a D-class personnel in presence of SCP-WOW-J.
