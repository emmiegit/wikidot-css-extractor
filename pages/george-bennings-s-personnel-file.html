Anyway, I haven&#39;t used this page for years and I presume literally nobody has ever looked at it, so I&#39;m going to post a big list of recommended reading here. Is there any kind of consistent theme or quality? No! Does the list include stuff that objectively has zero literary value like Halo or Warhammer novels? Yes! Is it very inconsistent on whether or not novellas are included? Also yes!

Let&#39;s face it, the only two things I wrote that people even halfway liked got deleted with the crossover purge, so this is pretty much the best I can offer. 

The more pluses, the higher the recommendation.
