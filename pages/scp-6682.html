**Item #:** SCP-6682

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-6682 requires a standard Class II Humanoid Containment Chamber. 2 (two) CCTV cameras are installed in each corner. ##red|The room must be kept within 0.000001 lux. SCP-6682 does require sustenance but prefers meat.

But I&#39;d still //like// it.## [[/collapsible]] 
**REVISION 2008-1-2:** As of 2008-12-26, SCP-6682 has been moved to [DATA EXPUNGED] following recent developments. SCP-6682&#39;s documents must be reviewed daily for unauthorized changes by trained personnel with proper knowledge of SCP-6682&#39;s abilities. SCP-6682 is to be kept in a Class-V Humanoid Containment Cell. The only access point in the cell is a small tempered glass viewport, viewed through a periscope. In case of damage, the Site Director is to be notified immediately. No devices or documents of any kind are to be moved within a 10-meter perimeter of SCP-6682. Any devices or documents possibly afflicted by SCP-6682 should be destroyed, no hospitality of any kind is to be shown to SCP-6682, persons found sympathetic to SCP-6682 are to be reassigned, and no items of any kind are to be provided to SCP-6682.

**Description:** SCP-6682 is the designation given to ##red|a human measuring 1.7 meters, held prisoner without consent.## SCP-6682&#39;s skin is dark grey in coloration, with similar physical properties to ABS plastics. It is not impervious to damage, however, SCP-6682 is capable of recovering through individual triangles materializing in damaged sections, interlacing together over a period of time to repair the surface. It is unknown to what extent injuries can be healed. Through observation of wounds, SCP-6682 appears to be hollow. SCP-6682 displays unusually high strength and coordination, capable of ##red|giving hugs,## however, SCP-6682 can be effectively subdued with minimal effort, entering a state of unconsciousness after sustaining fire from ##red|999## rounds of 9x19mm ammunition. SCP-6682 is sapient and conversational, exhibiting a positive outlook and attitude, and acts jovially when conversing or interacting with other sapient beings. SCP-6682 has been shown to be fluent in English, French, Spanish, Latin, Portuguese, and Italian. It is theorized that SCP-6682 is also capable of understanding several other languages, including Russian, Mandarin, Japanese, and Hebrew. ##red|Possibly even more.## SCP-6682 is ##red|compliant.## [[collapsible show=&#34;          &#34; hide=&#34;              &#34;]] ##red|I&#39;m kind to them. Not that they return the favor.## [[/collapsible]] As such, ##red|SCP-6682 should be allowed 2 hours of escorted roaming of Site-82,## as it poses a massive risk in the case of a containment breach. SCP-6682 has been observed to be ##red|conventionally attractive.##

**Addendum:** SCP-6682 was discovered after mounting police reports of suicides and homicides in the state of Colorado, with equally as unusual circumstances and no evidence. Attached below is documentation regarding the theorized victims of SCP-6682.

During the breach of Site-82 in March, SCP-6682 was found inside the Site cafeteria. It claimed to be searching for the nearest evacuation shelter. It is unknown how SCP-6682 was released from its containment area, as CCTV recordings were destroyed following the fire. SCP-6682 was successfully recontained following breach cleanup without incident. ##red|Updating containment procedures is not necessary.##
**Maintenance note:** The fire started at 07:01, the exact time I booted the terminal that manages CCTV feed. I reckon it&#39;s the version of Windows that messed up somehow, and propose we upgrade to Vista, which will surely be much better.

**On Christmas Day 2008, 03:00**, SCP-6682 was discovered to be absent from its containment area. A lockdown was not initially considered,  however, it was discovered that the on-duty guard, Blake Roberts, was not at his post, and all relevant CCTV cameras were found to be powered down. Following this discovery, a partial lockdown was initiated.
**03:20:** A guard failed to update their status near the Light Containment Zone&#39;s main armory. Investigation did not find any sign of a struggle, nor was a body found. A screw was found on the floor near the guard&#39;s station. 
**03:30:** An A/C unit in the Light Containment Zone fails catastrophically, starting a small fire. On-site maintenance have the fire controlled by 03:37. 
**03:42:** A CODE YELLOW is declared, and MTF Psi-15 &#34;Castle Bravo&#34; was mobilized to secure the perimeter of the facility. 
**03:47:** A distress call is made by a guard at Checkpoint 25. A transcript is attached below.[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Sgt. Micheal:** //Quiet yawn.//
//Other than the buzz of the AC, the only noise is the clicking of safety being fiddled with.//
//A quiet thump is heard from the right.//

//Another thump. Audibly closer, the crinkle of shifting clothes is heard.//
**Sgt. Michael:** Uh-?
 //A nearby thump. Click as safety is toggled, footstep as the guard prepares himself.//
**Sgt. Michael:** The devil is-
//Silence for a moment. Soft, metallic plink.//
**Sgt. Michael:** Screws?
//A clang as a large metal object is dropped to the ground. A controlled burst of 3 shots is released. Sgt. Micheal is heard yelling before a heavy thump is heard. Soft clutter follows.//
**Sgt. Michael:** ##red|Got &#39;em.##
//Feed cuts.//
[[/div]]
**03:49:** Guards routed to Checkpoint 25 found a removed vent cover. Sgt. Micheal was not at his post. 
**03:50:** Guard Blake Roberts was found in a janitorial closet in the Light Containment Zone. Taken in for questioning. 
**04:00:** SCP-6682 was spotted on CCTV near Checkpoint 3 for approximately 0.7 seconds before the feed continued showed an empty hallway. 
**04:01:** A CODE RED is declared. Attached below is a PA announcement from Site Director Harris made around the same time.  
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
Site-82, this is Director Harris.
All personnel, you are advised to shelter in place, or head to the nearest safe zone as applicable.
We have confirmed reports of one uncontained anomaly, which poses massive risk to human life. 
Our teams are on-site and working diligently to recontain the threat.
Thank you for your cooperation.

&#34;We had no idea it could [CENSORED] with the cameras. What else was it hiding from us?! It must have been using the vents to get around, which is absolutely absurd, I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s managed this and I want a full investigation after we find the damn thing. The only silver lining is that it&#39;s hiding. And that means it probably can&#39;t go invisible, or avoid human eyes. If it can? God help us.&#34;

__Conducted by Dr. Atkins__

[BEGIN LOG]
**Dr. Atkins:** ...thing is on. Alright. 

//Chair slides, Doctor sighs.//

**Dr. Atkins:** Blake. I&#39;m just here to ask you a couple of questions.

**G. Blake Roberts:** Right.

**Dr. Atkins:** You have been the guard with access to SCP-6682&#39;s containment for 2 years, as of now. You have successfully managed and maintained SCP-6682 for this long, and kept it satisfied and compliant. Now, I&#39;ve just finished cleaning up the largest breach in 4 years, and I&#39;ve got to explain how 4 on-site personnel got killed by your, ahem... negligence. This isn&#39;t like you. So. What were you doing in that closet?

**G. Blake Roberts:** //Inhales.// I was just looking for a sponge. Spilled my coffee. 

**Dr. Atkins:** During a Code Yellow. That was your first instinct? 

**G. Blake Roberts:** I didn&#39;t know it was a Code Yellow. Didn&#39;t she- it- go back to containment the last breach?

**Dr. Atkins:** It did. But that was 2 years ago. And it sure as hell didn&#39;t go back quietly this time.

**G. Blake Roberts:** She just- 

**Dr. Atkins:** Begging your pardon, but we&#39;re required to refer to the skips without gendered pronouns. How do you even know SCP-6682 is female?

//Silence.//

**Dr. Atkins:** Blake. I&#39;m on your side here. However. If you can just be honest with me, we&#39;ll make sure everything gets cleared up, and you can go back to your post. Now, all I wan-

**G. Blake Roberts:** She fuckin&#39; forced me, okay?! 

//Silence.//

**G. Blake Roberts:** She was gonna... tell &#39;em about what we did. I only gave her the doc because she said she was curious, and she&#39;s been in there so long I just... you... you fuckin&#39; bastard, she&#39;s HUMAN! Human as the rest of us! And I ain&#39;t... ain&#39;t made of stone, Bob, she doesn&#39;t like bein&#39; held prisoner and I just wanted to help her. She didn&#39;t fuckin&#39; tell me she was about to go on a murder spree, goddamn it! 

**Dr. Atkins:** You let an anomaly //talk// you into letting it out!? Blake-

**G. Blake Roberts:** She didn&#39;t talk me into jack shit! And I didn&#39;t let her out, either! 

**Dr. Atkins:** But you aided-

**G. Blake Roberts:** I gave her a couple of documents on the anomalies here and the site! That&#39;s all I did! I let her read &#39;em because she was sick of watching FRIENDS reruns on Site TV! 

//Slam of a table.//

**G. Blake Roberts:** Y-y&#39;know what? Yeah! Yeah, fuck it, I //don&#39;t// regret jack shit! I didn&#39;t sign up as a guard for prisoners, I signed up because I&#39;d be //savin&#39; the damn world from these creepies!// Nobody told me the goddamn things were sentient, and nobody told me they were lonely, and... I get fuckall clearance anyway!

//Breathing.// 

**G. Blake Roberts:** You stuck-up snob! You&#39;re... you find this so funny, don&#39;t you? You think you ain&#39;t the same? You think you wouldn&#39;t feel sympathy for a trapped human?! You&#39;re... you&#39;re a fuckin&#39; machine, you cold, heartless bastard. F-fuck me.

//Silence.//

**G. Blake Roberts:** Okay? Okay. Okay okay okay. It&#39;s... look. I&#39;m not heartless enough for this damn job, I s&#39;pose. Even in the Army we... I&#39;unno, at least they shot back. But she didn&#39;t do nothin&#39; to deserve life in prison.

//Sigh.//

**G. Blake Roberts:** //Rough chuckle.// But she lied. She said it&#39;d be clean and quick, and I&#39;d be off the hook &#39;cuz I wasn&#39;t there. But now? Fuck, man. I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m really sorry.

//Silence.//

**Dr. Atkins:** Thank you for your honesty, ##red|traitor.##

//Feed cuts.//

**Note:** It seems unbelievable, even as I write this. Blake Roberts was a loyal man. I was the one who personally recommended his position at the Foundation. He worked here for 17 years, as of today, and successfully handled multiple smaller incidents of his own accord. He was committed to the Foundation&#39;s cause and was an iron-willed, intelligent, and strong man. I do not know what the hell this thing said or did to him in order to cause a reaction like this. It is almost inconceivable. I feel a sense of betrayal, a sense of loss, and most of all, disappointment. We should have taken better care of this situation. We should have noticed the discrepancies. We need to encourage reporting every single little thing we notice. We need to be able to bother our superiors about things that do not seem to have immediate consequence. Because all these little slip-ups lead to one giant bloodbath. 
I have the blood of 6 loyal Foundation agents on my hands.
I //will// keep this damn thing locked up.

Owing to SCP-6682&#39;s recent behaviors, the risk that it presents in the case of an escape, and the scale of the associated containment breach, SCP-6682 has been approved redesignation as Keter. 

SCP-6682 has been escorted to a Class IV-SC containment cell. After the strangulation of G. [DATA EXPUNGED], this has been upgraded to a Class V-SC containment cell. SCP-6682, since the incident, has become extremely violent. The use of firearms to subdue SCP-6682 has been approved. It has been deemed impossible to monitor SCP-6682 through any realistic means other than human observation, as other formats are corruptible by SCP-6682. As such, a small viewport will be built, and a periscope will be installed, allowing monitoring from a safe distance. SCP-6682 is to be provided with no further contact or information. 

&#34;Some may see the new procedures as overkill. They are overkill. I will have no more deaths attributed to my name.&#34; -Dr. Atkins to Site Director Harris following the incident
