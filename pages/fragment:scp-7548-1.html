**Special Containment Procedures:**

Following SCP-7548&#39;s completion on 21/01/2017, no further events or phenomena related to the anomaly have occurred. The anomaly has tentatively been reclassified as neutralized, although Foundation satellites MALAKBEL-1 through 10 are to continue to monitor the Sun for further possible occurrences of SCP-7548, in tandem with monitoring for SCP-1548. Protocol Koyash-Veure has since been discontinued, with its equipment and expertise now focusing on Protocol Olwen-Dhata instead.

As a result of SCP-7548&#39;s &#34;Yehi Ohr Events&#34;, the Foundation is currently debating whether to enact a total LV-Zero &#34;Lifted Veil&#34; scenario.

------

**Description:**

SCP-7548 was a mass astrological, musical thaumaturgical ritual performed on 21/01/2017 and lasted approximately 6 minutes. SCP-7548 was achieved through the application of an underminable amount of electromagnetic, thaumaturgical projections and gravitational alterations in planetary, solar, satellite and galactic coordinates. As well as celestial bodies, several known and unknown anomalous individuals and items partook in the performance of SCP-7548, with a majority of them having connections to GoI-3088 (&#34;Church of the Second Hytoth&#34;).

When played, SCP-7548&#39;s melody is composed of sounds not dissimilar to those heard made by pipe organs and a 4-part choir. Many witnesses have reported when hearing SCP-7548, they felt a sense of awe, joy, serenity and oceanic feeling[[footnote]] An emotion coined by Romain Rolland, which refers to a feeling of &#34;being one with the external world as a whole&#34;. [[/footnote]]. It is unknown whether this response is a result of an auditory cognitohazard or just a standard emotional reaction to the melody.

The performance of SCP-7548 resulted in an Öß-Class &#34;Multi-Universal Amalgamation&#34; Scenario with several extra-universal lifeforms, called &#34;Voru&#34; in Ortothan mythology, gaining physical or conceptional forms within baseline reality. These manifestations, designated as &#34;Yehi Ohr Events&#34;, has resulted in several anomalous items, location and alterations, both terrestrial and extra-terrestrial //(refer to Addendum 7548.2)//.

**Addendum 7548.1:** Performance of SCP-7548

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Foreword:** This transcript is a collation of data transmitted by various satellites and telescopes across the solar system.

-----

**&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;**

The projections around SCP-2399 vanish, with the structure beginning to emit a faint orange light. At the same time, SCP-179 moves 200 km towards the sun&#39;s north pole and manifests six additional arms, which each point at the eight innermost planets of the solar system. SCP-3417 send out a single transmission, saying &#34;Pray&#34; before cutting off.

SCP-179 begins to move, forming graceful movements and gestures, similar to that of a ballet dance. It appears to be speaking whilst moving, although its movements prevent enough time to interpret them. SCP-2399 then begins emitting a bright orange light, with the aurora forming into several symbols once more. The Sun starts forming several projections of TS-164, TS-225 and TS-791 along with several unknown symbols across its surface. All planets&#39; atmospheres within the solar system, including Earth, engulfs in aurora, which are filled with projections of thaumaturgical symbols. A melody, estimated to be around 110 dB, is heard worldwide.

On Mercury, [[[SCP-3965]]] is seen leaving the planet&#39;s surface, joining SCP-1682 and motioning through the aurora, both appearing to dance. In the outer regions of the heliopause, several [[[SCP-1281|biomechanical objects]]] are seen motioning around each other. In the background, all observable stars and light sources are seen pulsating in a rhythmic fashion. [[[SCP-2499]]] was noted to be partaking in the pulsations.

As the melody continues, SCP-179 begins to accelerate in motion, gesturing more frequently. The formations of TS-164, TS-225 and TS-791 also grow more frequently. At this time, spectral entities around SCP-2821 begin to dance and gesture too. As they do so, SCP-2821 begins to rapidly shrink, emitting several, rapid radio transmissions, with the words &#34;Song&#34; being used frequently.

As the melody enters its supposed bridge and final chorus, the Sun, along with several observable stars, decreases in luminosity before suddenly increasing. SCP-179 begins to move faster and faster almost becoming encased with projections of thaumaturgical projections. SCP-2399 begins emitting a series of golden light which begins joining with the aurora in the sky. A great electromagnetic pulsation is detected emitting from all bodies with the solar system, as well as a rapid burst of in thaumactivity and a sudden destabilisation and stabilisation of Hume levels.

As the melody concludes, SCP-2399 ceases projections and crumbles into a pile of metallic dust. The sun rapidly decreases its projections of TS-164, TS-225 and TS-791 and SCP-179 stops moving, smiles and bows, appearing to have tears in its eyes.

**&lt;END LOG&gt;**

**Afterword:** Quickly following the completion of SCP-7548, a transmission from SCP-3417 was received.

**Addendum 7548.2:** Related Phenomena

The following is a summary of some of the Yehi Ohr Events that occurred following the completion of SCP-7548.

||~ Description ||~ Notes ||
|| [[[SCP-3930]]] was found to be now filled with a landscape and ecosystem identical to the surrounding environment. When investigated, the Foundation discovered a small settlement consisting of 249 human individuals. 19 of these individuals were identified as Foundation D-Class and 34 were identified as missing GoI-018 (&#34;GRU Division P&#34;) personnel. None of the individuals had any memories of their lives prior to the completion of SCP-7548, despite being fully socially and mentally capable. || The discovered human individuals are currently under the study of the Department of Anomalous Humanoid Psychology. ||
|| When reporting for duty 2 days following SCP-7548, [[[david-rosen-file|Researcher Rosen]]] discovered System Analyst Patrick Gephart, who&#39;d been reported missing since 29/07/2011, unconscious in his office. Rosen&#39;s computer had also experienced an electrical fire, destroying its hard drive. || Gephart is currently undergoing a medical examination. No reason for why Rosan&#39;s computer underwent destruction has been determined. According to Rosen, before login off, he was working on a reoccurring ticket regarding an erroneous [[[SCP-000|spot]]]. ||
|| The spectral entities located near Area 32 were found to have vanished. When SCP-2821&#39;s camber was examined, it was found to contain a single, humanoid entity, reassembling [[[SCP-4017]]]. Before measures could be enacted, the entity breached containment and flew out toward the outer regions of the Solar System. || Attempts to locate the entity are currently ongoing. ||
|| Doctor Foster discovered that [[[SCP-2713]]] had undergone an alteration, with its extra-dimensional space now resembling a soft play area and nursery. Several known instances of SCP-2713-2 instances were observed, along with several previous unseen instances that reassembled human infants and toddlers. || SCP-2713&#39;s special containment procedures are to be updated. ||
|| During an examination of the ██████-2 probe, it was found that SCP-179 was joined by a second similar entity, although with the external appearance of a human male. The two have since been designated SCP-179-1 and SCP-179-2. || Attempts to communicate with SCP-179 regarding SCP-179-2&#39;s origin is ongoing. ||

Monitoring for further Yehi Ohr Events is ongoing.
