[[include component:image-block name=drbellusfinal.png|caption= SCP-3803 displaying an instance of SCP-3803-1 within it.|width=300px]]

**Item #:** SCP-3803

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3803 is currently held in a secure container within Site 55&#39;s Low-Risk Item Storage. All instances of SCP-3803-1 are to be incinerated after testing is concluded.

Following Incident 3803-1221, testing with SCP-3803 may only be conducted with written permission from three [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/security-clearance-levels |Level-4 Personnel.]]] SCP-3803 is --currently being held shut with a rubber band-- to be placed within a custom-made container with secure notches and an overhead weight to ensure the object remains shut while contained.

**Description:** SCP-3803 is a standard size portable business card case made of brushed aluminum with a felt interior. The exterior is silver in color and decorated with a small engraving of the object&#39;s manufacturer; &#34;APP Inc&#34;. SCP-3803 opens and closes with an interference fit latch, the tab of which has become unreliable following a containment breach (See Incident 3803-1221 for details).

When SCP-3803 is opened it will produce 10 business cards unique to the subject opening it, referred to as SCP-3803-1. Instances of SCP-3803-1 are made of high-grade cardstock, possess simple designs, and are double-backed. The contents of SCP-3803-1 list professional information of the subject; listing one&#39;s affiliation and position in the front, with contact information on the back (if applicable). SCP-3803 will continue to produce instances of SCP-3803-1 containing the information of the subject who opened it, with more instances manifesting if the object is kept open. Additional instances manifest in tens every thirty seconds. 

**Addendum 1: Testing Logs**

[[collapsible hideLocation=&#34;both&#34; show=&#34;+ Show Testing Logs&#34; hide=&#34;- Hide Testing Logs&#34;]]
**Note:** Foundation personnel&#39;s contact information; typically appearing on instances of SCP-3803-1, has been expunged from records for their privacy.


&gt; **Subject:** Researcher Bellus
&gt; **Title on SCP-3803-1:** Level-3 Researcher, SCP Foundation
&gt; **Instances Produced:** 10

&gt; **Subject:** Dr. Xuen
&gt; **Title on SCP-3803-1:** Containment Specialist, SCP Foundation
&gt; **Instances Produced:** 10

&gt; **Subject:** Junior Researcher Callaway
&gt; **Title on SCP-3803-1:** In Over Her Head, SCP Foundation
&gt; **Instances Produced:** 10
&gt; **Note:** This is the first occurrence of SCP-3803 producing an instance of SCP-3803-1 not reflecting an accurate title. It is possible that SCP-3803 is capable of sensing one&#39;s perceived position as opposed to &#39;knowing&#39; one&#39;s official title.

&gt; **Subject:** Researcher Palacio
&gt; **Title on SCP-3803-1:** Level-4 Researcher/Catering Expert
&gt; **Instances Produced:** 20
&gt; **Note:** Researcher Palacio is a self-admitted amateur chef. SCP-3803 was held open for longer than any previously performed test and is the first recorded instance of producing more than 10 SCP-3803-1 instances.
 

&gt; **Subject:** Dr. Jonas
&gt; **Title on SCP-3803-1:** Traitor, GOC
&gt; **Instances Produced:** 10
&gt; **Note:** Dr. Jonas defected from the [[[goc-hub-page|Global Occult Coalition]]] in 20██, and expressed discontent with the results of the test. Dr. Jonas requested a repeat of the test.

&gt; **Subject:** Dr. Jonas
&gt; **Title on SCP-3803-1:** Quisling, GOC
&gt; **Instances Produced:** 10
&gt; **Note:** Dr. Jonas requested a third attempt to repeat the test.

&gt; **Subject:** Dr. Jonas
&gt; **Title on SCP-3803-1:** Judas, GOC
&gt; **Instances Produced:** 10
&gt; **Note:** Dr. Jonas refused another attempt at testing. The results of the most recent experiments further belief in what was hypothesized following the Callaway experiment.
 

&gt; **Subject:** D-99963
&gt; **Title on SCP-3803-1:** Serial Arsonist/███████ Cashier
&gt; **Instances Produced:** 20
&gt; **Note:** The instances of SCP-3803-1 possessed the location of D-99963&#39;s Cell within Site 55 instead of contact information. SCP-3803-1 also displayed the subject&#39;s birth name and D-Class designation. This remains constant for almost all further tests performed with D-Class subjects.
 

&gt; **Subject:** D-99963 
&gt; **Title on SCP-3803-1:** Serial Arsonist/Human Guinea Pig
&gt; **Instances Produced:** 10
&gt; **Note:** D-99963 was administered Class C Amnestics to erase memories of her criminal activities before coming under Foundation control. The produced instances of SCP-3803-1 still listed her as a &#39;Serial Arsonist&#39;, but also added &#39;Human Guinea Pig&#39;. The subject&#39;s birth name was no longer listed on SCP-3803-1, only their D-class designation. It is possible that SCP-3803 may, in fact, possess a level of omniscience.

&gt; **Subject:** D-008
&gt; **Title on SCP-3803-1:** Cannibal/Human Guinea Pig
&gt; **Instances Produced:** 10
&gt; **Note:** D-008 was not administered amnestics prior to the experiment. 

&gt; **Subject:** D-627
&gt; **Title on SCP-3803-1:** Innocent/Accountant, ███ Bank
&gt; **Instances Produced:** 10
&gt; **Note:** Investigation on D-627&#39;s background produced an extensive legal battle over the subject&#39;s involvement in the murder of 4 individuals in █████████, Virginia in 2███. It is currently unknown if SCP-3803&#39;s labeling of D-627 as &#39;innocent&#39; means the subject is actually innocent or if the subject only believes himself to be.

&gt; **Subject:** D-5400
&gt; **Title on SCP-3803-1:** Human Guinea Pig/Business Card Extraordinaire 
&gt; **Instances Produced:** 3,500
&gt; **Note:** SCP-3803 seemed to be aware of the intentions of the test with D-5400; to test the yielding capacity of the object over an extended period of time.
 

&gt; **Subject:** D-743
&gt; **Title on SCP-3803-1:** Human Guinea Pig/Business Card Tycoon
&gt; **Instances Produced:** 8,000
 

&gt; **Subject:** D-1221
&gt; **Title on SCP-3803-1:** Absolute Buffoon/Enemy of Nature
&gt; **Instances Produced:** --12,000-- Estimated over 2 billion
&gt; **Note:** See Incident 3803-1221 Report.

**Addendum 2: Incident 3803-1221 Report**
@@ @@ 
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Open Report&#34; hide=&#34;- Hide Report&#34;]]
Following the last experiment with D-1221 utilizing SCP-3803, the object was placed in its designated container and stored. D-1221 failed to properly shut the object, as its latch had not locked into place fully and was slightly ajar. As SCP-3803 remained in an active state, it continued to manifest instances of SCP-3803-1 and quickly filled its container beyond capacity; ultimately leading to the destruction of the container.

Due to the minimal security measures in Site 55&#39;s Low-Risk Item Storage and the low foot traffic in the area, the continued production of SCP-3803-1 instances went unnoticed for several days until [[[SCP-4224|Dr. Everwood]]] attempted to enter the Low-Risk Item Storage and was buried under thousands of SCP-3803-1 instances. Dr. Everwood sustained minor injuries and was rescued by responding security personnel. Through the combined efforts of 2 security and 5 D-Class personnel, SCP-3803 was recovered and production of SCP-3803-1 stopped.

The object was examined following retrieval; it was noted that the latch used in SCP-3803&#39;s open-closing mechanism had been bent as a result of its constant manifestation of SCP-3803-1 instances. Though the object will still shut, it has difficulties remaining closed and will often come ajar. The creation of a custom-made case to keep SCP-3803 from opening while not under direct supervision has been commissioned. --SCP-3803 is currently being held shut with a rubber band.--

All instances of SCP-3803-1 from incident 3803-1221 contain the same information as the previously recorded 12,000 instances from the last test. All recovered instances from the incident have been incinerated. Following the incident, Site 55&#39;s Low-Risk Item Storage has been outfitted with security cameras and guards have been assigned to patrol the area.

**Update:** On ██/██/2006, satellite images of the Amazon Rainforest in Rondônia, Brazil were brought to the Foundation&#39;s attention. The images display a dramatically accelerated rate of deforestation in the area over a short period of time. The captured images are dated ██/██/2003 (five days before SCP-3803 was contained) and █/██/2005 (fourteen days after Incident 3803-1221). 

[[include component:image-block name=amazon.jpg|caption= Rondônia, Brazil, ██/██/2003|width=300px]]

It is currently unknown if SCP-3803 and Incident 3803-1221 are the cause of the sudden mass deforestation. Additional tests to confirm a correlation are currently pending approval. [[footnote]] Including deployment of [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces |Mobile Task Force Theta-4 (&#34;Gardeners&#34;) ]]] for investigation. [[/footnote]] Investigation of the logging activities in Rondônia&#39;s Amazon basin revealed supplier contracts with Avelar Professional Products Incorporated, shortened to &#39;APP Inc&#39;. The Foundation is currently in talks with the Brazilian government to negotiate the cessation of all logging in the area to allow a more thorough investigation.
