**Item #:** SCP-3844

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- ##blue|Neutralized##

**Special Containment Procedures:**  ##blue|The remains of SCP-3844 are to be kept in a standard containment locker for non-anomalous materials. The former location of SCP-3844&#39;s dwelling is to be inspected once every 72 hours for possible anomalous activity.##

**Description:** SCP-3844 --is-- ##blue|was## a winged reptile, measuring --50.22m-- ##blue|10.30m## from tail to head, and with a wing span of --42.78m-- ##blue|8.33m##[[footnote]] According to most recent measurements.[[/footnote]]. It --is-- ##blue|was## estimated to weigh --18,000kg-- ##blue|235kg##. SCP-3844&#39;s scales --are-- ##blue|were## of a ##blue|pale## blue hue, except around the stomach where they --are much lighter-- ##blue| were completely white##. SCP-3844 --is-- ##blue|was## capable of forcefully expelling a methane vapor from its mouth (achieving temperatures as high as 1950°C), and igniting it --through unknown means-- ##blue|through an instantaneous application of thaumaturgical incantation #043##.

SCP-3844 --is-- ##blue|was## capable of speech in --7-- ##blue|at most 2## languages, and --has moderate-- ##blue|had little## knowledge of world events. During interactions with personnel, SCP-3844 --takes-- ##blue|took## the form of an adult male, however SCP-3844 --claims it can-- ##blue|claimed it could## mimic the appearance of any human[[footnote]]##blue|This claim has yet to be corroborated by any evidence.##[[/footnote]].

SCP-3844 --inhabits-- ##blue|inhabited## an immense cavern that --contains-- ##blue|contained## approximately 5.22x10^^4^^kg of valuable metals (approximately --2.6 billion-- ##blue|13.4 million## US ##blue|1984## dollars). SCP-3844 often --burrows-- ##blue|burrowed## underneath these materials, where it presumably sleeps.

In conversation, SCP-3844 --has-- ##blue|had## confirmed that it is the inspiration behind a number of european myths involving dragons. It also --claims-- ##blue|claimed## to be the model for the Welsh flag[[footnote]]&#34;I used to be red you know. A vibrant red to match the fire I&#39;d breath. Those were indeed good days.&#34;[[/footnote]].

**Addendum:** The following is a transcript of --an-- ##blue|the final## interview between O5-2 and SCP-3844 ##blue|before SCP-3844 attempted to breach containment.## 

&gt; ##blue|&lt;**Begin Log**&gt;##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**SCP-3844:** Why, hello. I&#39;m a little surprised you showed up.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**O5-2:** You did ask to speak with the person in charge of your containment. I&#39;ve been doing this since the beginning.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**SCP-3844:** It&#39;s not that I expected you to decline my request. I&#39;m surprised you&#39;re still upright instead of laying down under the earth somewhere.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**O5-2:** I mean, it&#39;s nothing special. I tried to refuse, but the council insist they keep their figure head in pristine condition. It&#39;s just a bit of thaumaturgy and temporal technology.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**SCP-3844:** It&#39;s magic, is what it is.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**O5-2:** Everything is science when you examine it for long enough.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**SCP-3844:** That is more or less what I&#39;ve learned over that past century or so. Which is really too bad.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**O5-2:** How so?##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**SCP-3844:** Have you ever looked up at the stars as of late?##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**O5-2:** Not really, no.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**SCP-3844:** Regardless, can you tell me what you would see?##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**O5-2:** Stars?##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**SCP-3844:** But what are stars?##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**O5-2:** Balls of flaming gas. If you want me to be more specific I could list their chemical components.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**SCP-3844:** No, that&#39;s fine. I&#39;ve read up on them myself. However, do you know what a duke once told me many, many years ago when I asked him the same thing?##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**O5-2:** I believe he would&#39;ve given a much less accurate answer.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**SCP-3844:** He said, &#34;They&#39;re little lights from the heavens.&#34; His voice spoke with awe, much like yours when we first met.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**O5-2:** Are you grieving over the advancement of science? Upset that we can now understand you?##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**SCP-3844:** No, I&#39;m mourning the death of spectacles and miracles. I wish I could embrace science, but it takes away so much of what I enjoy about this world of ours. It appears I&#39;m allergic to the stuff.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**O5-2:** Well, I don&#39;t have much I can do about that.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**SCP-3844:** I understand. It&#39;s fine. I think I&#39;ll finally have to break our agreement, although in fairness you did not exactly uphold your end.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**O5-2:** I can&#39;t just let you leave.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**SCP-3844:** I see no way for you to stop me. I really must be going. My wings have not felt the rush of air in a century, and I can hear my kin&#39;s beck and call.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**O5-2:** You seem quite confident.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**SCP-3844:** Confidence is all I have left. I don&#39;t want to believe that the world doesn&#39;t need its whimsy anymore.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|&lt;**End Log**&gt;##

##blue|SCP-3844 was terminated by the anti-aircraft artillery stationed around its dwelling. However, inspection of SCP-3844&#39;s projected trajectory uncovered the remains of a non-anomalous //Draco volans//[[footnote]] A species of lizard known as the &#34;common flying dragon&#34;[[/footnote]].## 

##blue|Additionally, the location of SCP-3844 no longer contained a large cavern, but instead a small hole, approximately 1m deep, and 2m in diameter.##
