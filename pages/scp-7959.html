**Item #:** SCP-7959

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The waters surrounding SCP-7959-A and SCP-7959-B are to be patrolled by security personnel at all times. Any vessels found attempting to enter the containment zone are to be diverted around under the guise of military exercises, weather phenomena, or scientific observation. Personnel are required to conduct explorations of SCP-7959-A and SCP-7959-B in groups no smaller than three individuals. 

During a Distress Event, all Foundation seafaring vessels must withdraw from the immediate 100 meter vicinity of SCP-7959-B and inform the on-site Foundation therapist assigned to SCP-7959.

**Description:** SCP-7959 is the designation for two sapient abandoned battleship-class naval vessels located in the waters off the coast of Chile. SCP-7959, individually referred to as SCP-7959-A and SCP-7959-B, will always travel in close proximity to each other, typically within ~10m. 

The interiors of SCP-7959 are in advanced states of disrepair. Despite the condition of the ships, all machinery, including weaponry, are fully operational. The skeletal remains of the former crew can be found throughout the vessels covered in a viscous, mucus-like substance. Personnel exploring SCP-7959 for prolonged periods of time have been known to vanish without a trace when unaccompanied.

SCP-7959 will communicate with nearby vessels utilizing radio signal broadcasts containing speech of adult human males with pronounced Southern Californian American accents. SCP-7959 may converse in a wide variety of topics, including current events, popular culture, history, politics, and, most predominantly, their affection for each other. SCP-7959 typically are cooperative with Foundation personnel, although SCP-7959-B has been known to indiscriminately fire upon Foundation vessels during Distress Events; These events are known to occur following interpersonal conflict between SCP-7959-A and SCP-7959-B. (See Addendum-1)

**Addendum-1:** SCP-7959 were discovered following local reports among Chilean fisherman of ghost ships and strange radio signals being received from undocumented vessels. Foundation personnel arrived in the area to investigate, and upon inspecting the area of reported sightings, picked up the following message on radio.

&gt; Oh... Oh... Could someone please [muffled static]. Could someone please... tell me... what the hell I did wrong this time? Oh, he won&#39;t talk to me at all, Oh, oh no...

Agent Richard Danson was able to triangulate the location of the radio signal, thereby resulting in the discovery of SCP-7959.

During initial discovery and reconnaissance, SCP-7959-A and SCP-7959-B were spaced approximately 500 meters apart. The investigative team boarded SCP-7959-A first and discovered the cadavers of 371 crew as well as noting advanced disrepair of the interior quarters. 

While attempting to board SCP-7959-B, a secondary team&#39;s vessel was fired upon by large mobile ballistic turrets mounted along SCP-7959-B&#39;s deck. The gunfire did not damage the vessel, but was close enough to be deemed a safety hazard. During the gunfire, SCP-7959-A was briefly intelligible through the radio signal:

&gt;  ...Don&#39;t need to be like that, I swear.... [muffled static] just a dinky old raft...

A safe distance of 100 meters was established by the investigative team, and provisional efforts to establish containment began.

**Addendum-2:** Following the establishment of containment, a specialized radio line was established to receive signals from and send signals to SCP-7959-A. Two way communication was successfully established between Foundation personnel and SCP-7959-A, resulting in Interview-7959-A-1.

**Foreword:** Interview conducted by Agent Danson.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**SCP-7959-A:** God, am I a screw up, fumbling the love of my life so bad, over something so insignificant, so paltry! How can I ever-

**Danson:** Hello, can you hear me alright?

**SCP-7959-A:** Oh, yes, I can! Finally, someone here who can help me! You heard my calls, correct?

**Danson:** Yes, we- er, I did. We came to investigate what&#39;s going on. May I ask who I&#39;m speaking with?

**SCP-7959-A:** You&#39;re speaking with me, who else would you be talking to? I&#39;m right here. My partner is not exactly conversational at the moment.

**Danson:** You&#39;re the ship?

**SCP-7959-A:** Who else would I be? 

**Danson:** Right... well, we discovered some remains aboard the ship and have some questions to ask-

**SCP-7959-A:** I need some help, you see. My partner, that hunk you see over there, well, he&#39;s kind of... moody. I guess you could put it that way. He&#39;s got that chihuahua affect to him. I love him a lot, you know, but this time it&#39;s gotten really bad. Really bad.

**Danson:** I&#39;m sorry, but would you be able to answer some of my questions, I promise it won&#39;t take long.

**SCP-7959-A:** An amateur interviewer, my god, I feel like a veritable Marlon Brando. Minus the fellatio, though, hah! That&#39;s a good story for another day. But the more pressing matter to your costume, is that, well. I need him back.

**Danson:** Who is him? I&#39;m trying to figure out what&#39;s going on here.

**SCP-7959-A:** If you would listen to me, I&#39;m saying what&#39;s going on. That little yacht of yours, well, it&#39;s just made things worse. I thought we could fix things like we always do. 

**Danson:** Alright, just slow down a bit. You&#39;re talking too fast. Who is this partner of yours?

**SCP-7959-A:** Do you think I make a habit of making love to tiny humans like you? No, it&#39;s that handsome battleship right across the frigid, ice cold barren strait of water. 

**Danson:** Oh, right, SCP-7959-B.

**SCP-7959-A:** Is that what the kids are calling it these days? Hah!

**Danson:** So you and him are friends?

**SCP-7959-A:** As the puritan historians may say one day! No, we are lovers, life partners for four decades at this point. Sailing the seas together, for a long while now. 

**Danson:** ...Right. Well, I belong to an agency-

**SCP-7959-A:** -Not a cop are you?

**Danson:** No, not really. We kind of specialize in dealing with cases like you and your... partner&#39;s.

**SCP-7959-A:** Oh! My! God! That&#39;s actually incredible. You came at the right time, because I really, really, want to make things right with him again. I know I may pretend to be a stoic to his face, but, I know you therapists have seen-

**Danson:** Actually I&#39;m not-

**SCP-7959-A:** I actually really do care for him. It&#39;s just, It&#39;s really hard to show it sometimes. I mean, I don&#39;t know how much experience you have with our like, but it&#39;s such a balance, you know.

**Danson:** I just want to ask some questions about the bodies-

**SCP-7959-A:** I still have some thinking stuck from my days of youth, that since I&#39;m the one who, you know, gives, to speak eloquently, well... there&#39;s a way I gotta act. I gotta be more of a man. I&#39;m from that old stubborn generation. But I really do love him, more than he knows.

**Danson:** I believe there&#39;s a miscommunication going on-

**SCP-7959-A:** God, I know! It&#39;s just, I feel like if I tell him how I feel without having all this bravado up and a-mock, it&#39;s like, well..? Maybe the allure is gone.

**Danson:** Christ, I guess I&#39;ll play along. Haven&#39;t you two been together for a long time? Wouldn&#39;t that &#34;allure&#34; have left already anyways.

**SCP-7959-A:** What do you mean? 

**Danson:** Listen, guy- er, boat. I&#39;ve been married for twenty years now, and I met my wife originally as just a sort of one off type thing. But we fell in love. And even though when I saw her and thought of here as only a lay, that attraction hasn&#39;t gone away even as I learned more about her as a person. 

**SCP-7959-A:** But you&#39;re, well, a heterosexual, right? It&#39;s different.

**Danson:** I mean, shit, I suck at talking about my feelings. I used to be afraid of it too. And honestly it&#39;s weird to be talking to a boat about this shit. But whatever. Is all this why he shot at us too?

**SCP-7959-A:** Probably. He gets so worked up when he sees other boats. I don&#39;t understand it. He should know how obsessed I am with him.

**Danson:** Right, well, trust you that we, or our boat, have no intention of harming either of you. This hubby of yours, is he a talker like you or a silent type?

**SCP-7959-A:** He&#39;s shyer than me, more reserved, I guess. More delicate. But he talks, he just doesn&#39;t like sharing his frequency. If you could, he&#39;s not speaking to me right now, giving me the silent treatment, but if I tuned him in for you, would you be able to get him to come back to me?

**Danson:** Actually, yeah I can do that. I need to speak to him anyways.

**SCP-7959-A:** Oh, god, thank you so much! Truly. I really do love that man.

Following this interview, personnel were also able to establish communication with SCP-7959-B.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+Interview-7959-B&#34;hide=&#34;-Access Granted&#34;]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Foreword:** Interview conducted by Agent Danson.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Danson:** Hello, can you hear me?

**SCP-7959-B:** Who is this? Did my so called partner send you?

**Danson:** Technically, no.

**SCP-7959-B:** You&#39;re not terribly convincing. 

**Danson:** I was sent here to investigate the circumstances surrounding you two.

**SCP-7959-B:** I take it people aren&#39;t too happy when I shoot at them? Well it figures we&#39;d get investigated sooner or later, given what we are.

**Danson:** And what exactly are you two?

**SCP-7959-B:** Are you blind? I&#39;m a battleship. And I know you talked to my idiot partner beforehand. I don&#39;t like to shout as loud as he does.

**Danson:** Well, the specifics aren&#39;t important. I do have some questions, though, about what&#39;s, er, inside of you.

**SCP-7959-B:** Oh, them? I mean, it&#39;s not really important how they got there. I know the reason you&#39;re here is to try and talk me into going back to him.

**Danson:** Well, no-

**SCP-7959-B:** Listen, it&#39;s not that big of a deal, I just need some space, or I needed space. But that fucking dreamboat that came, that one y&#39;all came on, just, I don&#39;t know, it made me snap.

**Danson:** Can we go back to &#34;them&#34;? Your partner didn&#39;t seem aware of the dead people inside of him.

**SCP-7959-B:** He&#39;s never aware of anything. He&#39;s a big dumb emotionless hunk of metal. I love him to death, but god, I do wish I could change some things about him. And yeah sure, maybe I was out of line for shooting at all those boats, but god, could you blame me?

**Danson:** You&#39;re aware that those other vessels aren&#39;t like you two, correct?

**SCP-7959-B:** Well, not yet. But you can&#39;t blame me for getting jealous. I mean, we aren&#39;t as pretty and shiny as we used to be, I sure as hell ain&#39;t. And I don&#39;t have the size to offer that he does. All these newer guys around, it&#39;s like, I dunno. He&#39;s so quick to broadcast us to anyone who passes by and I just wish we could be us a little bit more. 

**Danson:** You get jealous of these other ships?

**SCP-7959-B:** You already talked to the guy so I&#39;m sure you know that he&#39;s well, he&#39;s garbage at being tender. It feels like I have to sort through layers upon layers of irony just to be able to show some affection to him. I love him and he makes me smile but sometimes I feel like we&#39;re more friends than lovers. It&#39;s like chewing nails trying to get him to break down and talk with his heart.

**Danson:** Wow, uh well. Yeah I mean I kinda hoped I would be able to get some information from you but I guess I&#39;m doing this whole thing again. Your &#34;man&#34; or whatever, he did talk to me, about how he knows he&#39;s bad at this stuff. I came looking for something else but I guess I&#39;m stuck with this line of questioning.

**SCP-7959-B:** See, but if he knows he&#39;s like this, knows he isn&#39;t this affectionate type, I don&#39;t understand why he can&#39;t just, try harder? We&#39;ve been together for god knows how many years, and we feel so comfortable with each other, but, I don&#39;t know, maybe it&#39;s something wrong with me, but even though I know he loves me, I want him to say it, remind me, all the time, like every time is the first time back in Suez when we first laid eyes on each other.

**Danson:** Have you told him this directly?

**SCP-7959-B:** Of course I have! What does he think I do all this for?

**Danson:** He just thinks you&#39;re moody.

**SCP-7959-B:** Well, I am a moody person, but not with him! I just want his attention. I guess, I kinda of like when he gets desperate to win me back. But he should know this right?

**Danson:** And you&#39;ve told him directly that you wish he was more affectionate? Because he thinks you wouldn&#39;t like if he opened up. That it would turn you off.

**SCP-7959-B:** Well I, I mean I think so? I don&#39;t remember now. And if he thinks it would turn me off, he&#39;s dumber than I thought he was. God, all I want is to hear him be honest with me and drop all the pretense his generation was taught.

**Danson:** Then tell him. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m stuck with this, but you two should just fucking talk to each other, like actually talk about everything. Honestly. Maybe then I can finally find out about all the dead bodies you two have stowed away down there.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Addendum-3:** Since the events of Interview-7959-B, SCP-7959-A and SCP-7959-B have shortened their distance to 20 meters. SCP-7959-A&#39;s broadcasts appear to indicate that the two vessels have ameliorated their differences.

Licensed Foundation therapist Melinda Jackson has been assigned to handle regular communication and questioning of SCP-7959-A and SCP-7959-B in order to both prevent future distress events as well as discern any information regarding the circumstances of the crew&#39;s deaths if possible.
