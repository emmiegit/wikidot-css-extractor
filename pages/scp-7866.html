**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7866 is to remain active at all times. Its wielder, Robert Bumaro, must focus its power on --Dr. Hedvig Nussbaum-- Saint Hedvig (see the Update below for additional information).

In order to ensure the operational status of SCP-7866, Saint Hedvig must remain compliant, quiet, and [[span class=&#34;tb&#34;]]PERFECT[[/span]]. 

In the event that Robert Bumaro has any questions regarding SCP-7866, he is permitted to consult Legate Trunnion on the matter. [[footnote]] Saint Hedvig is forbidden to consult Legate Trunnion on the matter, as she is forbidden to have any questions regarding SCP-7866. [[/footnote]]

Extraneous knowledge of the existence of SCP-7866 would result in containment failure. In order to avoid an information breach, this file has been confined to the mind of Saint Hedvig. It is to remain there indefinitely.

[[div class=&#34;inline-colmod&#34;]]
**Update (28.03.1985):** As the continuous existence of Dr. Hedvig Nussbaum appears to interfere with the role of Saint Hedvig as the object of focus of SCP-7866, the containment staff are to seal her away posthaste in order to make space for Saint Hedvig. Saint Hedvig will be 
[[include :scp-wiki:component:inline-colmod show=perfect enough to ensure the continuous operation of SCP-7866. | content=exactly as perfect as her Emperor needs her to be.]]
[[/div]]

Dr. Hedvig Nussbaum is to be classified as SCP-7866-1 and her containment is to become top priority. 

As of 28.03.1985, the updated containment staff of SCP-7866 consists of Emperor Robert Bumaro (tasked with performing duties related to SCP-7866), and Dr. Robert Silas Aram[[footnote]] Unlike in the case of Dr. Hedvig Nussbaum/Saint Hedvig, Dr. Robert Aram is permitted to exist parallel to Robert Bumaro. His continuous existence is not detrimental to the upholding of SCP-7866. [[/footnote]] (tasked with containing SCP-7866-1). 

@@ @@

**Description:** SCP-7866 is the designation given to [[span class=&#34;tb&#34;]]the Voice[[/span]], a tool deployed by the Emperor of Amoni-Ram. It allows the wielder to control the minds of large groups of people. Historically, the entire population of Amoni-Ram, which counted approximately 523,000 persons at the height of its power, was known to be under its influence.

Access to SCP-7866 is given to the current Heir to the Golden Throne, descendant of the Bumaro Dynasty. This applies to direct and indirect descendants alike, so long as they have the necessary features which would qualify them for the Bumaro title, and should the Throne deem them worthy.

See [[span class=&#34;tb&#34;]]Addendum 7866.3[[/span]] for additional information.

**Nussbaum:** Scriptures and texts found within Amoni-Ram contained little to no information about the Voice. Dr. Aram was first informed of its existence by Legate Trunnion, formerly known as SCP-001-A1, following one of the experiments conducted on the Throne. 

//[The door of the throne room opens. Emperor Bumaro appears in the doorway. He does not move yet, instead he opts to lean against the wall and observe.]//

**Bumaro:** //[tilts his head]// When she attempted to do what? 

//[Dr. Nussbaum begins hyperventilating into her hand. Her eyes frantically dart around the throne room. She winces at each step Emperor Bumaro takes towards her.]//

**Bumaro:** What is the matter, Hedvig? Continue reciting your words. 

**Nussbaum:** //[muffled]// I... I can&#39;t.

**Bumaro:** Why? What is stopping you? Go ahead. Recall why I used the Voice on you. Recall what happened after.

//[Dr. Nussbaum shakes her head and squeezes her eyes shut.]//

**Bumaro:** Your Emperor commands you. [[span class=&#34;tb&#34;]]CONTINUE RECALLING[[/span]].

//[As he reaches her, Emperor Bumaro places his hand on her shoulder. Dr. Nussbaum shudders in shock.]//

**Nussbaum:** //[sniffs]// Robert... Please, take your hand off me.

//[Her shaky voice quiets down to barely a whisper. She attempts to shrug his hand off, to no avail.]//

**Nussbaum:** P-please... 

//[Emperor Bumaro begins fiddling with the clasp holding her gown in place. Dr. Nussbaum attempts to nudge his hand off with more desperation, to no avail.]//

**Bumaro:** //[rolls his eyes]// Fine. I will humor you.

**Addendum 7866.3:** Utilization of the Voice

SCP-7866 has two known components: 
# [[span class=&#34;tb&#34;]]Indirect component:[[/span]] Can be exerted with minimal effort and may remain undetected by the targets. Traditionally used to control the citizens of Amoni-Ram. Most effectively deployed with casual conversations, or during the morning prayer.
# [[span class=&#34;tb&#34;]]Direct component:[[/span]] Exerted onto one specific individual, also known as the object of focus of SCP-7866. Must be upheld at all times in order to ensure the operational status of the Indirect component.[[footnote]] Dr. Hedvig Nussbaum questions the legitimacy of this effect and does not understand why it must be upheld in the first place. Saint Hedvig has no such questions, as she [[span class=&#34;tb&#34;]]SILENTLY ACCEPTS HER ROLE[[/span]]. [[/footnote]] By using it, the Emperor must convince the object of focus that His will is her will, that His thoughts are her thoughts. The most effective ways to achieve this are intense psychological pressure, coercion, manipulation, or gaslighting.

--Dr. Hedvig Nussbaum is to keep in mind that--

[[span class=&#34;tb&#34;]]HEDVIG ARAM-BUMARO, THE EMPRESS, GENERAL, AND PATRON SAINT OF THE MEKHANITE EMPIRE[[/span]], is to keep in mind that while some level of resistance is permitted on behalf of the object of focus[[footnote]] Feeling this resistance shatter is known to boost the morale of the wielders of SCP-7866. [[/footnote]], she must take into consideration that the energy required to uphold the direct component is proportional to the strength of said resistance. [[span class=&#34;tb&#34;]]IT IS SO SELFISH OF YOU TO CLING SO DESPERATELY TO YOUR OLD SELF, HEDVIG. WOULDN&#39;T IT BE EASIER IF YOU JUST GAVE IN? YOU LOVE ME, DO YOU NOT? YOU LOVE ME AS YOUR HUSBAND, MASTER, AND EMPEROR, DO YOU NOT? SUBMIT, HEDVIG. SEAL AWAY THE PARTS OF YOU THAT DOUBT. YOU MUST BE PERFECT FOR ME, TO ENSURE I WILL BE ABLE TO RULE THE MEKHANITE EMPIRE.[[/span]] 

The following list shows the traits SCP-7866 shares with Saint Hedvig. The intrinsic connection offered by these similarities is the reason why Saint Hedvig is the only person capable of being the object of focus of SCP-7866:
* Perfection and Absoluteness
* Symbol of Power
* Fuladh
* Similarities with the prior Empresses
* [[span class=&#34;blurry&#34;]]Robert[[/span]]
* Gifted by, and made in the image of, Mekhane
* Pliant, malleable, 
* ...
The examples above also act as a justification to quell the doubts of Dr. Nussbaum. She must keep in mind that Emperor Bumaro took time out of His day to put together this list because she, specifically, was doubting Him.

**Addendum 7866.4:** Additional Context

The following interview has been provided as an example to show the kinds of anxieties Saint Hedvig possesses. The Emperor, at his own discretion, may attempt to alleviate said anxieties or utilize them in keeping SCP-7866 operational.

**Bumaro:** Better. But you still lack conviction.

**Update (02.08.1989):** After numerous attempts to do so since 1985, Dr. Robert Aram has successfully contained Dr. Hedvig Nussbaum on August 2nd, 1989. He succeeded in putting her soul to rest and sealing it away deep inside Saint Hedvig&#39;s mind, where not even her own consciousness can reach. As this file was utilized by her as an attempt to rationalize and explain to herself the reason behind Emperor Bumaro&#39;s fixation on her, it no longer serves any purpose and may be sealed away together with the soul of Dr. Nussbaum and the memories pertaining to her. 

The continuous exertion of SCP-7866 on Saint Hedvig will ensure Dr. Nussbaum remains silent indefinitely.
