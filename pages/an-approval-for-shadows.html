Dr. Sage West stalked down the halls of the first floor, searching intently for the plain white door that lead to the small dim-lit office that functioned as the dwellings of Dr. Viktoralai Amity Lost. 

She didn’t bother knocking, and Lost shouldn’t expect her to. West lived her life as a hurricane, and that did not include knocking. 

Lost still looked shocked, nearly toppling out of their chair. Luminous gold eyes stared wide behind thick black frames, violet hair a mess. “Sage!” 

“Obviously,” Sage would be very annoyed if someone ever mistook her for anyone else. She didn’t spend twenty minutes making her fine ginger hair perfect every morning for nothing. “You promised me results?”

Lost nodded, chewing on their lip nervously as they turned. The pushover, as Sage thought of them privately, was hunched over in a way that had to be hurting their back. Dark eye bags bruised them. 

“Yeah! So, Reynolds told you to look through the files you can access with your clearance. I’m only Level 3, but I managed to pull some strings and get the full database up anyway.” No doubt by hacking their way through. 

Lost might be a lot of things, but they weren’t stupid. Sage wouldn’t rely on them if that was the case. However, they were something else - painfully desperate for friendship. It had only taken a few lunch outings and invites to office parties for Lost to fall hopelessly dependent on West’s companionship. From there, they’d been Sage’s best asset. 

“Good,” Sage said, nodding. She took over the desk space, peering down at the screen.

[[[SCP-2000]]].

Sage took a breath, and scrolled through it. “Lost,” she said, as her eyes flicked over the sentences.

“Yes?” Lost perked up, looking hopeful. 

“I need you to get me information on this symbol,” quickly slipping her phone out of her pocket, she pulled up the photo she’d taken of the silver triangle engraved into the neck of Harris Lee. 

“Oh-” the pushover sounded almost disappointed. Sage didn’t have time to wonder why. “Okay. Should I-”

“Send me a report once you’re done,” West confirmed.

“Should I… keep it confidential?” Lost asked quietly, shoes scuffing the ground as they rocked back on their heels. 

“Preferably,” Sage said, scanning the last details of the file into a flash drive she’d brought. She didn’t want to review all of this just standing in Lost’s office. Standing in the stuffy room with the nervous pushover breathing down her neck like a cockroach didn’t sound appealing either. “Thanks a million, Val. You’re the best.” 

Val was the more endearing nickname of the two Sage had given the researcher, standing for Viktoralai Amity Lost - their full name. It made Lost blush faintly, grinning a crooked smile back. “Of course, anytime! Actually, if you want to get coffee later, I have a free hour aft-”

“See you later!” Sage called, shutting the door before Lost could finish their thought. She didn’t have the time to bluster through polite excuses right now, and if Lost wanted company, they could ask Levi or something. The stocky blonde from Containment was always taking on pet projects. 

Sage’s pet projects usually involved the chatter of white rats and late nights spent bent over computer charts. 

As she walked down the hall, she blew past a tall girl - and was nearly struck still. Beautiful, wavy black hair, pale skin and pink cupid’s bow lips. A regal, frosty Snow White in a silver dress and black tights. Obviously not dressed for any sort of work.

“Oh- hey,” the girl blew out a puff of air, scrutinizing Sage. “Do you know where the Director is? I’ve been looking around but can’t find her.”

Sage scowled. She debated just walking away - then sighed. “I’m going to see her right now. You can follow me.”

“Thanks.” Polished black heels followed behind Sage’s quick step, up the stairs that led to Director Emerald Reynolds’ office. They were opposite shades of the same glossy beauty - Sage’s swathes of freckles, her ginger hair scooped into a french twist, and rose gold charm bracelet jangling against her wrist. A small pack of dynamite. Then, the cool silver of her taller companion. A poison-tipped icicle.

Director Emerald Reynolds had the same power, if not the elegance. Black slacks, blonde hair scooped into a tight ponytail, with deep eye bags polishing off the look. She looked up, snapping alert as they entered the sparsley decorated room. 

“Miss Vega,” Reynolds spoke, eyes widening. Sage huffed, unhappy she hadn’t been the first order of business. 

“Emerald,” said Miss Vega - the beautiful girl’s name, it seemed - and she curtsied. Sage  gritted her teeth. 

“Reynolds,” she started, stepping forwards. “Can I talk with you?”

“Did you do the research I asked you to?” Reynolds responded, raising an eyebrow. Sage nodded. “The Deus ex machina. Is that what you wanted me to find?”

A small smile crossed the tall Director’s thin lips. “Good. I’ve already submitted a request for you to use it. If it gets approved, I’ll email you with more details,” she lifted her chin. “You worked fast. That’s good.”

Sage blinked- surprised both by the praise, and the foresight from Reynolds. “Oh,” was all she said. She wasn’t sure how she felt about being caught off guard - it wasn’t a common emotion for her. “... thank you,” she said. 

Reynolds had already moved her attention away, eyes focusing on Vega. “You’re dismissed, Dr. West. I have… matters of importance to discuss with Estrella.”

Sage paused. “Estrella?” The name clicked into place- Estrella Vega. Daughter of Marilla Vega. Sage turned, raking her gaze over Estrella once again, taking in all the details she’d missed in her first quick assessment. The designer watch on her wrist, the small charm necklace. A shift from gaudily polished to classically wealthy.

“... right,” West said, feeling Reynolds’ stare burning into her. Turning back, she stepped back through the office doorway, hearing it click behind her. In her head, she made a quick note in her priorities - finish the work with the poison for Loveland, get the research on the memetic symbol back from Lost, update Jack on the murder case once that happened…

And take a closer look into the world of Estrella Vega.

To quote the endlessly dragging prose of Hatchet, //there were these things to do, or whatever.//

------
Director Reynolds,

I will say, first and foremost, that I am very hesitant in doing this. When the decision was made to open SCP-2000 to more liberal testing purposes, it was still within the bounds that we considered the importance of limiting our privileges. As you surely understand, granting access too freely could lead to abuse of this anomaly’s power. 

This is compounded by my research on your Site’s history and purpose. I will never claim that any of the Foundation’s research falls outside the realm of necessary and useful operation. However, I have yet to see anything of notable significance from your facility, with the exception of personnel who reached acclaim after their departure from your Site. 

However, after consulting with the other staff members, we agreed that the nature of Dr. West’s work does seem of greater significance, and her competence has been backed by several major Department members. 

Taking all of this into account, our official verdict is to **##green|Approve##** the use of SCP-2000 for testing by Dr. Sage Odessa West. 

More details will be sent directly to Dr. West, with further inquiries to her intentions and specific needs regarding the anomaly. Please note this permission is viable to be revoked at any time, if we have reason to believe Dr. West is not of the mental or ethical state to properly use the machine. 

From,

Dr. Rosalyn Axel
SCP-2000 HMCL Supervisor
