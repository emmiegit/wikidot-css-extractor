Agent Basil Sias had not slept consistently in a week. 

Despite the reminders from Dr. Iglesias during each of their sessions, it was becoming more and more evident to those around him that Sias wasn’t following instructions. Whether this was a result of defiance against his therapist, or simply born from an inability to silence his screaming mind was unclear. What was clear, however, was that he was an exhausted man reaching the end of his rope. 

For the first time since their sessions had started, Iglesias grew curt with her patient.

“You promised me that you would get more sleep, Agent Sias.”

“I have,” he replied with a dismissive wave, laid out uncomfortably across the sofa as usual. 

Iglesias drummed her pen against her desk, her brows scrunching up as she pondered the man in her office. His eyes were framed with deep, dark circles. His naturally fluffy hair had been allowed to grow, falling around his neck like an unkempt mane. It wasn’t clear if he had been consistently washing it. It appeared that he hadn’t lost any weight, however, which showed that he had at least been consistently eating and working out. 

“What has your family had to say about all this?”

A pointed glare from Sias ended that line of questioning as soon as it began. Iglesias had stepped firmly on a raw nerve. It was clear that there were no answers here for her. 

She rested her chin on her hand, continuing to drum her pen mindlessly against the desk. With a heavy sigh she turned back towards Sias.

“Agent Sias, please. I just want to help you out here. You told me that you were willing to continue with this, but we’re not making any progress. I know opening up to a stranger can be hard-”

“I can’t just pour my soul out to you, Iglesias,” Sias snapped, “You may not be a stranger, but that doesn’t mean you’re someone I know I can trust. I know you want to help. Hell I know I //need// help. That’s why I agreed to all this, because I’m tired of feeling this way. It’s just…”


He hesitantly sat upright, pushing his back against the sofa’s armrest. He folded his hands in his lap, looking down on them with tired eyes.

“...I don’t know what it is. Just know that I’m sorry, alright? I’m sorry I can’t be where you need me to be as a patient.”

Iglesias shook her head.

“You aren’t the only person in the world who doesn’t do this therapy thing well. I have to keep the details vague for security reasons, but let’s just say my own inability to open up to coworkers caused a stir lately.”

Sias adjusted his position on the couch, facing himself towards Iglesias. He leaned forward, and cocked his head slightly. “Oh?”

“We’re the Foundation, Sias. You know that all our security theatre means I can’t tell you more,” she replied, sticking her tongue out slightly. He laughed. 

“Alright, fair. God this place is probably full of weirdos who’re sick in the head, huh?”

“I think you’d be hard pressed to find someone here who //wasn’t//,” she laughed with a shrug, “Keeps me employed at least!”

They both laughed for a moment, the air finally thawing just a bit. As the laughter died down, Iglesias cast an eye towards her watch.

“Ah, it’s time! Ok, Sias, let’s get you set up. I told you I needed you to sleep more, and since you decided you won’t do it on your own I’ll do it for you,” she said with a mischievous grin. Sias sighed, rising to his feet and heading towards the door.

“At least make it a good dream this time, alright?”

-----

[[div class=&#34;outside&#34;]]

Ixmucane opened her eyes, inside of a head she was becoming all too familiar with. It wasn&#39;t long before the dreamscape she found herself in came to life, hundreds of flickering memories filling the void with gentle lights. After some waving of her arms, she found the one she was seeking and activated it, the world reforming around her.

A gentle breeze blew through her headdress as the light of a springtime sun warmed her arms. Looking around, she realized she was in a suburban backyard. The lawn was meticulously manicured, surrounded by a tall wooden fence designed to keep out prying eyes. She cast her eyes towards the home the yard belonged to, but was unable to identify who the owner might be. The house itself seemed poorly defined, as if the dreamscape had been unable to properly display it. What may have been brick walls appeared more like a smattering of plaster, and the roof appeared more like a single flat tile. 

Before she had the chance to ponder the house further, however, she heard the sound of children at play. Sias, Wyatt, and two unfamiliar boys appeared in turn. One was an older boy. He looked similar to Sias, albeit closer to fifteen or sixteen years old. Where Sias&#39;s hair was relatively unkempt, this boy&#39;s was carefully groomed and cropped relatively short. He leaned against the wall of the home, hands in his pockets as he watched the other three children chase one another. 

The other child was smaller than Sias and Wyatt by a few inches. A puff of curly black hair sat atop his head. Large glasses framed his face, which was covered in freckles. 

After a few minutes of the younger boys running in a perfect circle, legs barely touching the ground, they each stopped to catch their breath. 

&#34;We should play something new now. Something that Marc can play too!&#34; Wyatt said, pointing towards the older boy. The boy perked up, confused to hear his name mentioned. 

&#34;Huh? You guys don&#39;t need to try to include me. I&#39;m just supposed to watch you guys, that&#39;s all,&#34; Marc replied with an awkward smile.

&#34;No way! You should join us too, Marc!&#34; Basil said with a brilliant smile, before lowering his voice, &#34;C&#39;mon, please?&#34;

&#34;Okay, okay. If you really want me to,&#34; Marc removed his hands from his pockets and walked over to join the trio. &#34;So... uh, what&#39;s the game?&#34;

&#34;Can I pick?&#34; the smallest boy asked in an equally small voice.

&#34;I guess so,&#34; Wyatt said, deflated, &#34;What&#39;s your idea, Steven?&#34;

&#34;We should play house!&#34; Steven said with a bit more confidence. 

&#34;That&#39;s dumb,&#34; Basil replied, arms crossed, &#34;What would you even do in that game anyway?&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s not dumb!&#34; Steven raised his voice, before immediately retreating back into himself, &#34;I-I mean it could be fun I guess. Uh... Basil could be the dad, Wyatt could be the kid, Marc could be the dog--&#34;

&#34;The dog?!&#34; Marc exclaimed.

&#34;Wait, what about the mom? There isn&#39;t anyone who could be the mom here!&#34;

&#34;I... guess I could be the mom? Maybe?&#34; Steven said, his face a crimson red. The other boys looked on unconvinced.

&#34;I still think that&#39;s pretty dumb,&#34; Basil said with a straight face.

&#34;We should play pirate!&#34; Wyatt exclaimed, suddenly snapping his fingers. The other boys perked up at this suggestion. &#34;I&#39;ll be the captain! The fearsome Captain Bayside, known for his bravery! Mwahaha!&#34;

Wyatt threw his head back in dramatic laughter before continuing. 

&#34;Basil can be the first mate! Steven can be the uh... second mate! And Marc can be the parrot!&#34;

&#34;Why do I keep getting assigned animals?&#34; Marc asked, a slight smile on his face.

&#34;No questions for the fearsome Captain Bayside! There&#39;s an enemy to take down!&#34;

A gust of wind tore through the dream, causing Ixmucane to block her eyes with her arms. When she opened them, she found herself aboard a massive galleon sailing in an endless blue ocean. Before her stood the three youngest boys, each dressed like an eight year old boy&#39;s idea of a pirate right down to the eyepatches and peg legs. On Wyatt&#39;s shoulder sat a brown parrot, the feathers on its head styled suspiciously close to Marc&#39;s hair. 

&#34;Avast me hearties! There be trouble afoot!&#34; Wyatt exclaimed in dramatic fashion, brandishing a cutlass towards the sky. &#34;Our enemies have spotted us! They&#39;re here to take our booty! Man the cannons!&#34;

&#34;Aye aye, captain!&#34; the other boys shouted in unison with a salute before scrambling off to different ends of the ship. 

The sounds of cannons firing alongside the smell of smoke filled the air as Ixmucane found a barrel to sit and watch the dream unfurl. She watched in silence as the boys continued their game, laughter filling the air as Captain Bayside continued to issue increasingly nonsensical commands, going so far to demand the other boys help him fight a kraken with their bare hands. 

&#34;What do you make of this, Ixmucane?&#34; buzzed a voice in Ixmucane&#39;s ear. 

&#34;How do you mean?&#34;

&#34;I mean, like, this dream isn&#39;t particularly traumatic for the patient. It doesn&#39;t seem to recall a moment of emotional distress or pain, nor does it seem to be a particularly formative moment in Agent Sias&#39;s life. So I guess what I want to ask is why grab this memory out of everything? Shoot, why grab any of the memories you&#39;ve grabbed recently?&#34;

Ixmucane stood, brushing nonexistent dust from her dress. She watched as Wyatt bravely climbed the main mast of the ship to fend off invading &#34;Zombie Skeleton Shark Pirates&#34;, as he claimed. Basil screamed out in dramatic fashion as Steven pretended to be impaled through the chest by one, with parrot Marc mimicking every sound. She smiled.

&#34;Humans do not get to choose what they dream, Iglesias. Likewise, they do not get to choose what memories end up important to them. Isn&#39;t it a wonderful thing, to be afforded the chance to relive a precious moment?&#34;

&#34;I... guess?&#34; Iglesias responded. Through Ixmucane, she watched as the three young pirates cheered, having felled their final foe. They threw their arms around one another&#39;s&#39; shoulders, thrusting their swords into the air. Iglesias couldn&#39;t help but notice that for the first time in one of these memories, Basil&#39;s smile truly reached his eyes. 

[[/div]]

------

Dr. Iglesias clicked through video after video on her monitor, looking for something, //anything// that could help with Agent Sias&#39;s case even a bit. But the mind was never such a simple thing, and somewhere inside she already knew that no single factor was going to be the solution to the issues the agent faced. 

Atop her desk sat SCP-6506, the small doll sitting in mocking silence. Iglesias had started keeping the doll with her as she went over case notes, the doll being the perfect audience for bouncing ideas and theories off of. 

&#34;The dreams are working, if nothing else. We&#39;re seeing small steps of progress there,&#34; Iglesias sighed, taking a large sip from a mug of coffee. &#34;But we haven&#39;t broken the mental dam, for lack of better analogy.&#34;

She gave a weak laugh.

&#34;I figured that a few sessions would be enough. Recalling a few memories, even with a dreamy lens, should&#39;ve been enough to shake everything else free right?&#34;

Iglesias clicked back to the first video in the session. 

&#34;These videos are just a mess of memories. Honestly I&#39;m not even sure why half of them are here. A random summer pool party, some kids running around in grass, Basil and Wyatt making a snowman... these are all //cute// but what is the importance? Why did his mind hang onto them, and why did it try to lock it all away?&#34;

Her eyes met the doll&#39;s, as if waiting for an answer. None came.

&#34;You&#39;d say something along the lines of &#39;the human mind is a fickle thing&#39; right? You know //so// much after all,&#34; she moaned, rolling her eyes, &#34;The great Ixmucane, knower of all, savior of dreams, and a silent little doll.&#34;

She leaned back in her chair, running her hands down her face in exasperation. Her arms fell to her side as she shot a passing glance back to the doll.

&#34;At least you&#39;re putting things in order for me. Makes getting a timeline together easier.&#34;

------

&#34;Alright Agent Sias,&#34; Iglesias shouted from her desk, &#34;I&#39;m about to put you under again. Everything okay?&#34;

Sias responded with a simple thumbs-up. Iglesias nodded in return, and after a bit of tapping at her keyboard, Sias was asleep and the system was live. Her computer screen sparked to life, once again showing her a feed through Ixmucane&#39;s eyes. Ixmucane wasted no time, grabbing another spark of memory and bringing the dreamscape to life. 

[[div class=&#34;outside&#34;]]

Ixmucane found herself inside of another dining room, though this one felt colder than the one before. The table was rectangular, crafted from some type of polished plastic or vinyl. The white chairs arranged around it provided enough room for four people exactly, arranged meticulously. The walls were bare, save for a single photograph of a purple orchid. Sitting at the table were a young Basil Sias and Marc. He sat upright at attention, whereas Sias sat with stiffened shoulders, eyes fixed down towards the tabletop.

Across from them sat a woman. Her hair was tied up in a messy bun, several flyaway hairs showing that said bun had been left up for some time. She was dark, much like Ixmucane herself, and likely Hispanic in origin. She sat upright much like the child across from her, but slight sniffling and puffy red eyes broke her composure. The seat beside her was empty, though Ixmucane could swear she saw a slight depression in the chair&#39;s fabric.

&#34;Is something wrong, mom?&#34; the older boy asked.

&#34;Your father and I wanted to talk to you boys about something very important,&#34; she replied, steadying her breaths. The older boy nodded his head, but Sias&#39;s remained focused on the table in front of him.

The room was silent as the older boy&#39;s head turned towards the empty chair. After a moment of silence, he gave the space a slow nod.

&#34;So that&#39;s... that&#39;s what&#39;s happening. We know it&#39;s going to be an adjustment for both of you. We also decided that Basil will stay here with me, and you&#39;ll go with your father, Marc. Is that ok?&#34;

Marc looked towards his younger sibling with apologetic eyes. Basil made no acknowledgement of the gesture. 

&#34;Yeah. That&#39;s... fine,&#34; Marc said, looking back to his mother, &#34;If that&#39;s what you all want, I&#39;m okay with it.&#34;

&#34;Marc, you don&#39;t have to pretend to be okay with this if you aren&#39;t. If something&#39;s wrong--&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s fine, mom. I&#39;m not surprised,&#34; Marc interrupted, a pained grin on his face, &#34;So it&#39;s okay. I&#39;ve been ready for a while.&#34;

Mrs. Sias lifted her head slightly, her eyes widening. Her cheeks grew flush as she looked away from her son and drummed her fingers against the table. She opened her mouth as if to speak, but no words came. She turned to head to the space next to her before turning her gaze to Basil. 

&#34;Basil, sweetie? Please say something.&#34;

Darkness began to slowly envelop the room, slowly creeping over everyone until a single spotlight shone on Basil. The table was gone, all that remained was a terrified child in a ring of light. The question could be heard echoing in the air as the child gripped his pants with shaking fists. Ixmucane cautiously stepped closer, attempting to see his face. It was a flush red, his eyes furiously shut tight as if he thought that not seeing made it all go away. Despite all his anger, all his frustration, and all his helplessness, no tears fell. 

&#34;Ixmucane?&#34; Iglesias whispered.

&#34;End the dream, please,&#34; she replied, cupping a hand on the child&#39;s cheek.

[[/div]]

-----

Sias lay awake in his bed that night, staring at the glowing stars on his ceiling. Thoughts swirled about his head in a cacophony of ideas and emotions. The more he tried to quiet his screaming mind the more noise it would make in return. He grimaced, gripping his pillow and throwing it over his face. 

Since his sessions with Dr. Iglesias had started, his lost memories had been returning bit by bit. This is what he //wanted//, wasn&#39;t it? Yet as he sorted through the mental sludge of vague, meaningless concepts, he couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that there was something he didn&#39;t want to remember, a reason his brain had locked away the specifics of the past 27 years of his life. 

&#34;Bee?&#34;

A noise pulled him out of his spiral. He felt a weight shift in the bed beside him. 

&#34;What&#39;s wrong, Bee?&#34;

Sias sighed, removing the pillow and returning it behind his head. He turned to face the source of the noise. He could just make out the man&#39;s outline, but in the darkness he couldn&#39;t make out the details of his face.

For some reason, that made him shiver.

&#34;...Hi,&#34; the voice continued, with a lighter tone.

&#34;Hi,&#34; Sias finally responded with less enthusiasm.

&#34;Wanna talk? You&#39;ve been distant lately.&#34;

Sias opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. Instead, he let loose a single choking gasp as the tears that had been building since his session earlier finally broke free. The other man sharing his bed wrapped his arms around him, pulling him close. Sias felt his face pressed against a firm chest, and pulled himself closer. They remained in that position as the tears continued, the man gently stroking his fingers through Sias&#39;s hair.

&#34;I&#39;ll wait as long as you need me to, Bee,&#34; he said with a gentle and familiar tone, &#34;All hurt goes away eventually, right?&#34;

Sias gave a struggled nod against the other man&#39;s chest.
