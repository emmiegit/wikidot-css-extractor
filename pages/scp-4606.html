[[include component:image-block name=D.jpg|caption=SCP-4606, circa 1918. Picture received courtesy of O5-3.|width=277px]]

**Item #:** SCP-4606

**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the contractual agreements aligned in Addendum 4606.1, SCP-4606 is free to roam [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/site-17-hub Site-17] and interact with onsite personnel. When not roaming, SCP-4606 is contained within a low-security humanoid containment domicile, furnished with standard human amenities. Additionally, SCP-4606 has requested the following items for the chamber which have included, but are not limited to:
* A monthly subscription to magazines such as Time, National Geographic, and Bon Appétit which is to be delivered to its chamber. (Approved)
* A notepad (Approved)
* A fountain pen (Approved)
* A carpet (Approved)
* Several novels that have been written by Edgar Allan Poe, Stephen King, and H.P. Lovecraft. (Approved)
* Televison with cable. (Pending)

When roaming, a tracker is to be placed around the wrist of SCP-4606&#39;s left or right arm and securely fastened. This tracker is sealed with a ten-digit number lock. Due to the entity&#39;s curious nature, MTF Gamma-1 (&#34;Search and Destroy&#34;) is to patrol areas of sensitive information whenever SCP-4606 roams the site, usually at locations requiring the status of Level 5.

**Description:** SCP-4606 refers to a Class IX reality-altering polymorphic humanoid entity currently named &#34;Dean&#34; and was previously known as Deimos, the god of terror in Greek mythology. SCP-4606&#39;s true form is unknown as it has assumed various identities, shapes, and forms. Forms taken by SCP-4606 so far have been described as:
* A red, skinless, skeletal humanoid with pinprick eyes and hair.
* A large, dark mass of human arms and legs with multiple bloodshot eyes in the center. 
* An M4 Sherman tank with mutilated nude corpses draped and bleeding across the surface.
* A tall, winged humanoid with a single large eye on its head.

SCP-4606 is capable of creating extradimensional entryways into a pocket dimension. These portals appear as dark cracks on any surface which produce a black, viscous liquid of unknown composition that spills from within[[footnote]]This fluid has been often described to smell of tar, ink, and roses.[[/footnote]]. Electronic devices that enter these portals will be subjected to electromagnetic interference that lasts ten minutes before this interference subsides completely. How these devices are capable of maintaining a stable connection within this dimension, is unknown.

**Addendum 4606.01A:**
//Interview was conducted immediately after SCP-4606&#39;s sudden appearance and apprehension from the site&#39;s entrance. Amnestics were administered to all staff involved in the incident and all footage of SCP-4606 has been altered.//

**Interview Transcript**

**Date:** 02/12/2013

**Interviewed:** SCP-4606.

**Interviewer:** [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/o5-command-dossier|O5-3, member of the Overseer Council.]]].

[BEGIN LOG]

//O5-3 enters the room. SCP-4606 stands up from its seat and approaches O5-3.//

**SCP-4606:** It&#39;s good to see you, kid.

//Both SCP-4606 and O5-3 extends their hands and shake.//

**O5-3:** Likewise. So tell me, why are you here? You know you could&#39;ve given me a call.

//Both SCP-4606 and O5-3 sit down on the chairs.//

**SCP-4606:** It&#39;s been too long, kid. I wanted to see what you&#39;ve been up to. Is all the security really necessary?

**O5-3:** In the position I&#39;m in, yes, all of this is necessary.

**SCP-4606:** I see. Well, I&#39;m here because I want to do something. I&#39;m- I&#39;m tired, kid. I&#39;ve been stuck in the same circle over and over again. It&#39;s a fate worse than Hell- or Hel- or Tartarus, whatever the fuck you call [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2922|the underworld]]], nowadays.

**O5-3:** Yes but er- I&#39;m not sure how my colleagues will take kindly to your... unexpected arrival.

**SCP-4606:** Perhaps I may speak with them? A good explanation doesn&#39;t hurt anyone.

**O5-3:** That can&#39;t be done. We... have rules, and one of them involves no interaction between individuals of anomalous nature. I&#39;ve already broken this by shaking your hand.

**SCP-4606:** Then what am I to do? Stay in these walls and not move an inch?

**O5-3:** I may- I may talk with them. Convince them that you mean no harm towards us.

**SCP-4606:** Then bring this to them. //(A large scroll materializes in the hands of SCP-4606.)//

**O5-3:** What is it? //(O5-3 is given the scroll and begins to read.)//

**SCP-4606:** A contract. It means that, under certain rules, I will be under you and your colleague&#39;s commands.

//O5-3 continues to read the scroll for five minutes.//

**SCP-4606:** I do hope I&#39;m not overstepping here, am I?

**O5-3:** We&#39;ll see about that. I&#39;ll bring this to them but... don&#39;t expect anything positive to come about this.

**SCP-4606:** Oh, I don&#39;t expect much. I just... hope that they make the right decision.

**Interview Transcript**

**Date:** 02/12/2013

**Interviewed:** &#34;Dean&#34;, SCP-4606.

**Interviewer:** Dr. Fabian Torres, [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4366|Extradimensional Anomalies Department.]]]

-----

[BEGIN LOG]

**Dr. Torres:** Alright, lets start with introductions; who are you and how did you get here?

**SCP-4606:** My name is Dean, a god. I used a portal to reach your facility&#39;s gates.

**Dr. Torres:** Yes, but- How did you know where this site was located?

**SCP-4606:** I am an old, old, god. Older than you realize. I&#39;ve been on this world far longer than your organization&#39;s founding.

**Dr. Torres:** I see. You did mention that you&#39;re Deimos, yes? //The// Deimos of Greek myth?

**SCP-4606:** Well, it is hardly a myth. But yes, I am Deimos, god of terror and dread.

**Dr. Torres:** Why... are you here then? What do you want?

**SCP-4606:** What do I want? It&#39;s simple: I want a job.

**Dr. Torres:** You want... a job? Here?

**SCP-4606:** Yes, that&#39;s what I said. I&#39;ve grown tired of what your world has to offer me. I&#39;ve been many things and have done just as much over the centuries, but- but I feel... lacking. Like I have been limiting myself for far too long for such simple tasks.

//Dr. Torres is silent for twelve seconds.//

**SCP-4606:** Hello?

**Dr. Torres:** I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s just that- that we don&#39;t usually have entities come to our doorstep. Much less ask for a job.

//SCP-4606 laughs.//

**SCP-4606:** Oh doc, that&#39;s the truth. I want to work here and do my part in any way that I can. Anything that involves what I&#39;m capable of, to be exact.

**Dr. Torres:** I see. I&#39;m not sure if- if you can work here but... I&#39;ll call my superiors first and... see what they think.

**SCP-4606:** Of course.

//The following is the transcript of the meeting at Site Command discussing SCP-4606 motives and demands. Prior to this, O5-3 was screened to check if he was under cognitohazardous influence by SCP-4606. O5-3&#39;s results came back and showed no abnormal afflictions.//

**DATE:** 10/12/2013

**NOTE:** Board meeting with Overwatch. 
----
**[/Begin]**

**O5-1:** So let&#39;s begin. What sort of threat does this entity present to us?

**O5-4:** At the moment? He&#39;s just waiting in his chamber for an answer. We told him to stay put, he listened, and now he&#39;s just... looking and waving at the camera.

**O5-12:** Three? How do you know this man?

**O5-3:** That isn&#39;t a man. He&#39;s an old friend of mine from my past. Way before my birth. He says he wants to talk to you all.

**O5-12:** So a humanoid entity arrives at our doorstep, with knowledge of one of our colleagues, and predates the Foundation? Sounds suspicious, don&#39;t you think?

**O5-5:** I agree, we may have cut contact with all our friends and families, but this one strikes me as odd. Have you told him anything?

**O5-9:** Three is a dirty fucking liar. Cut him loose.

**O5-11:** Nine...

**O5-3:** That&#39;s rather hostile and uncivil of you to act in this meeting, don&#39;t you think?

**O5-9:** No. //(O5-9 begins to raise his voice and raises himself from the seat.)// Here&#39;s what I don&#39;t get: You have someone from the outside who you //personally// know, and suddenly, he comes to us and asks for-

**O5-1:** Steady, Nine.

**O5-9:** //(O5-9 slowly sits down.)// Fine.

**O5-1:** Three? Please explain your relationship with this... thing.

**O5-3:** The one that calls himself &#34;Dean&#34;, is in fact, a god. A god who&#39;s power far eclipses that of any of the creatures and anomalies that we struggle to contain in our stead. His immortality has left him rather... dull, to be blunt.

**O5-12:** Hold on. You&#39;re friends with a //god?// What is he- What is he the god of? What power does he have that puts him above any of the entities that we contain?

**O5-3:** Fear. He&#39;s a god that controls your inner fears and exploits them. He- He&#39;s a good person. I&#39;ve met him during the World War. The second one.

**O5-1:** Since we&#39;ve never met this man before, we&#39;re going to need more proof of his existence than you simply reminiscing of your past life.

**O5-3:** I see. I&#39;ve gathered all of my documents and journals related to his nature, if that serves any purpose.

**O5-12:** Three, you still haven&#39;t answered to us why he&#39;s here.

**O5-3:** Er... he says he wants a job.

**O5-5:** We don&#39;t hand out jobs like its some damn charity, Three. We&#39;re locking him up and that&#39;s that.

**O5-3:** Wait- //(O5-3 brings out a scroll from his person and rolls it out on the table.)// Here.

**O5-1:** And what is this?

**O5-3:** He wants to cut a deal. He&#39;ll offer his services to us as long as we do the same with his demands.

**O5-1:** This- //(Continues to read the scroll.)// This is absurd. Why should we follow these?

**O5-3:** Because I know him well. He&#39;s not like those gods of old. He wants to be useful. //(O5-3 folds his arms together.)// My friend has given us a chance. His power, we have the power of a god to do our job, and the only thing that stands in our way are just a few simple demands? Then so be it.

(//The rest of the council look at eachother before looking towards O5-1.)//

**O5-1:** Okay then, Three. We&#39;ll see how loyal he is to us, but if he goes out of line? He&#39;s sent to a cold cell in 81.

**O5-3:** Understood.

**Addendum 4606.03:** List of Anomalies affected by SCP-4606.

||~ Affected Anomaly||~ Cause of Dispatch||~ Event Description||~ Post-incident Action Report||
||[[[SCP-4450|SCP-4450]]]||27/03/2005. SCP-4450 (consisting of the former four members of MTF-Rho-0 &#34;No Resistance&#34;) was sighted destroying different Foundation sites and areas worldwide. Operation: Scare Tactic[[footnote]]Operation: Scare Tactic is a plan to converge all members of SCP-4450 onto the Point of Contact in one location. By then, SCP-4606 will utilize its abilities to trap SCP-4450 in its pocket dimension for an unspecified amount of time until SCP-4606 is ordered to release SCP-4450.[[/footnote]] is immediately enacted at the Point of Contact during the exchange between O5-3 and the former leader of MTF-Rho-0. Large cracks form beneath the feet of SCP-4450, as large tentacles burst from the ground and wrap around the mouths of each member of SCP-4450 to prevent their escape to SCP-4450-1. SCP-4606 emerges from the cracks in the ground and begins to sink all of them into the portal. The drone used for monitoring SCP-4606 was accidentally hit by a stray tentacle, causing it to fall into the portal below. The heli-blades suffered minimal damage, but it became immobile due to the fall.||Due to the angle and the fall, only SCP-4450 could be seen through the drone&#39;s camera. SCP-4450 can be seen restrained by appendages from the ground with a door bearing a sign hanging from the front that reads &#34;Employees only.&#34; The door slams open as multiple appendages with bladed tips thrust out and pierce the members of SCP-4450 and pull them into the door. Screams and shouts can be heard from behind the door as SCP-4450 continues to mention that &#34;He isn&#39;t the real Boss.&#34; Banging can be heard from the door for the next five minutes before the door slowly opens. SCP-4606 emerges from the door, carrying the members of SCP-4450 with the same appendages. One of the members of SCP-4450 mouths what is assumed to be the passphrase to SCP-4450-1, and disappears. ||When asked if SCP-4606 had killed any of SCP-4450&#39;s members, SCP-4606 claimed that he &#34;only roughed them up.&#34; When questioned on what SCP-4450 was referring to when they had mentioned an individual known only as, &#34;The Boss&#34;, SCP-4606 did not respond to the question.||
||[[[SCP-076|SCP-076-2]]]||10/08/2007. SCP-076-2, &#34;Able&#34;, emerges from the coffin within SCP-076-1 and proceeds to rampage throughout the Primary Containment Zone of the area; causing the site to enter its Alert Condition One. SCP-076-2 manages to get past the killing corridor and begins to destroy much of the Administrative and Support Area&#39;s living faculties and personnel. SCP-4606 is sent to intervene with SCP-076-2&#39;s destruction from a portal behind SCP-076-2. Both entities introduce themselves to one another before SCP-076-2 challenges SCP-4606 in a showcase of power. SCP-4606 agrees to SCP-076-2&#39;s challenge and tackles him into a portal in the ground.||SCP-076-2 materializes in a large body of water. Loud rumbling and noises reminiscent of a choir can be heard from within the clouds above. The clouds part to reveal a massive, flaming figure radiating white light in all directions with the figure&#39;s face obscured by fire except for a single, large eye in the center. Large intricate rings of light are suspended behind the back of the entity and simultaneously rotate clockwise and counterclockwise. SCP-076-2 begins to shout and curse at the large entity before the massive figure makes a gesture with its hand that causes SCP-076-2 to levitate until it is at eye-level with the figure. The entity raises its right arm and places a finger on SCP-076-2&#39;s head, causing SCP-076-2 to scream as bright light radiates from all over his body. As the light becomes too bright to see, SCP-4606 is given the order to stand down and release SCP-076-2.||Both SCP-4606 and SCP-076-2 emerge from a portal on the ceiling of the site. SCP-076-2 begins to stand up and walks away from SCP-4606; he continues to walk all the way back to SCP-076-1, wherein he steps inside, and closes the door, causing all the locks to seal shut.||
||[[[SCP-2669|SCP-2669]]]||15/01/2010. An experiment was proposed to see if SCP-4606 could interact with SCP-2669. Testing was denied at the behest of O5-3, 6, 10, and 11 for fear of losing a crucial asset. However, consent was given by SCP-4606 and gave permission to upload its consciousness onto SCP-2669.||After SCP-4606 was uploaded to SCP-2669&#39;s mainframe, contact with both entities was lost. Additionally, tracking of SCP-2669&#39;s target disappeared from all remote monitors within the Khevtuul 1 Command Center.||SCP-4606 re-emerged ten minutes later from a corner of the men&#39;s restroom within the Khevtuul 1 Command Center. SCP-4606 claimed to have had &#34;a nice chat&#34; with SCP-2669. A log documenting SCP-4606&#39;s interaction was recovered, but heavily corrupted with the only part not affected being the first ten minutes of their interaction. Please refer to Addendum 4606-2669.A1 for more details.||
||[[[SCP-682|SCP-682]]]||22/04/2014. During a routine check of the acid-resistant steel plates within the chamber, SCP-682 breaks free of its containment chamber and begins destroying the site it is held in. SCP-4606 is immediately dispatched to the location. SCP-4606 begins creating large cracks below SCP-682 with the dark fluid restraining its movements. SCP-4606 follows through the portal as SCP-682 becomes fully submerged.||SCP-682 materializes inside an identical copy of its containment chamber with the interior dimensions of the room being much larger. Multiple entities begin to rise from the acid in the chamber bearing the likeness of [[[keter-duty|Foundation personnel]]] that were killed by SCP-682 in the past. These entities begin attacking and tearing off chunks from SCP-682, repeating the phrase &#34;Disgusting&#34; over and over again. SCP-682 attacks these entities but they do not appear to be physically harmed. More and more of these humanoid entities continue to rise from the acid in the chamber and overwhelm SCP-682, before SCP-4606 receives an order to release SCP-682.|| After SCP-682 is released from SCP-4606&#39;s dimension, SCP-682 enters a docile state and complies with demands to enter a temporary holding chamber. It is estimated that this experience has reduced containment breaches from SCP-682 by 10%.||

Soon after SCP-4606 was recovered, SCP-2669&#39;s tracker was picked up and was found approximately 15,014 light-years from its original location around MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb&#39;s orbit within the Sagittarius constellation. How SCP-2669 arrived there, is currently unknown.

**Addendum 4606.2:** Ancillary Information.
//The following are excerpts recovered from the journals of O5-3 during his service in World War II. These excerpts are used with his consent as they provide additional insight into SCP-4606.//

&gt; Aug. 12
&gt; 
&gt; I saw him again on the field. I could only peer from the trench when he threw his gun at one of the soldiers. The gun went all the way through his face. Came out the other end. The bullets came hailing from the nests at the north edge and hit him. Bullets came whizzing past so fast, they decimated the dead trees. None of them could put a dent in him. Not even sure anything could dent him this way.
&gt; 
&gt; He turned into that giant bat-thing and took out the nests. We moved cautiously. Mostly out of intimidation for him.
&gt; 

&gt; Aug. 17
&gt; 
&gt; So apparently, our weapon calls himself &#34;Dean.&#34; He offered me a drink in the pub nearby and asked me to join him.
&gt; 
&gt; I sat on the barstool next to him. Watched him gulp down three mugs in less than a minute. I barely even had time to finish mine.
&gt; 
&gt; There was some silence between the both of us. It&#39;s rather hard to converse with a living weapon that&#39;s meant to be the ace up our sleeve. I broke the ice and asked him:
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;So what brings you here to the unit? Why&#39;d you join?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Good Lord, he went on his lengthy, drunken tirade on how, in his heyday, he was a god among men. People would pray in his name. He&#39;d go off on his adventures with the greeks. Greek this, Greek that. Apparently, he left his pantheon after Monotheism kicked in and forced him to retire. And this made him pick up odd jobs ever since.
&gt; 
&gt; Or something like that.
&gt; 
&gt; So this guy isn&#39;t only a shapeshifting abomination with a drinking problem, but he&#39;s also an immortal god with a drinking problem.
&gt; 
&gt; I think I need another drink.

&gt; Aug. 28
&gt; 
&gt; He told me how his mom and pop argued over him. What to do with him and his brother&#39;s recklessness. Dean told me that his brother was too naive and gullible for someone his age. Not as gullible as the [[[SCP-3740|Ashur guy]]] he keeps talking about, mind you, but rather surprising that they&#39;re both twins.
&gt; 
&gt; Dean tells me he&#39;s got a bit of a falling out with his family. He left his dad to his work, his mom left them for their pantheon, and his brother is nowhere to be found. He wants to bring them back together, but he doesn&#39;t know where to start. I&#39;d asked if there was anything I could do to help and he just laughed and said: &#34;Kid, maybe after this little war, you can help me around.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Looks like I owe him a favor for his help back there in the trench.

//The following is a recovered letter sent from SCP-4606 to O5-3 and dated 1953.//

&gt; Hey kid, long time no see.
&gt; 
&gt; So I&#39;ve been thinking a lot of what to do after all this is over. I&#39;ve spent a lot of time sitting on it and I think that being a soldier isn&#39;t the best fit for me.
&gt; 
&gt; I know now that I&#39;m not a fighter. I don&#39;t fight for a cause, especially one that isn&#39;t mine. Hell, I only enlisted just to make my dad proud. I hope that, if he could see me, he could see that I did my best. I&#39;m really not cut out for this whole soldier-patriot crap. I just want to do things on my own. Live my own life and all that hubbub.
&gt; 
&gt; I saw [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2006|my brother]]] a while back. He was happy. I saw him watching this horrible flick. Terrible effects, abysmal settings, awful concept, and don&#39;t even get me started on the monster itself! That thing looked like a monkey that was crossed with a fishbowl!
&gt; 
&gt; But he was happy. I saw him terrorize some of the folks inside, got a laugh out of me that my own brother is doing what he does best: Scaring the living daylights out of people for gaffs.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;d send you another letter for the address, but I think you and your people already know where he is. Main street, I think.
&gt; 
&gt; Goodbye, kid. Take care of my brother for me, he&#39;s the only family I&#39;ve got left.
&gt; 
&gt; - Dean
