**Item #:** SCP-1106

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-1106 is to be kept in a secure containment locker in Site ██.  All testing must be approved by Level 3 staff or higher.  All uncontained instances of SCP-1106 discovered must immediately be secured and brought into containment.

**Description:**  SCP-1106 is a cylindrical metal chamber composed of an unknown alloy determined to be roughly 96% iron.  During its &#34;standby&#34; phase, SCP-1106 is inactive and its top cover will be open, granting access to the interior; however, the inside is consistently found to be empty during the &#34;standby&#34; period.  If at any point a human tissue sample is placed inside the chamber, such as a buccal scraping, or a sample of blood, saliva or [REDACTED], SCP-1106 will close and enter its &#34;locked&#34; phase.  All attempts to open or otherwise access the interior of SCP-1106 during its &#34;locked&#34; phase have proven unsuccessful.  Attempts to place cameras or other devices inside SCP-1106 to observe the inside during the &#34;locked&#34; phase have also failed; it appears that the item will not close and lock if there is any inorganic material inside the chamber.  Three (3) months after the initiation of the &#34;locked&#34; phase, the chamber will reopen and produce a human infant genetically identical to the sample donor.  The products of SCP-1106, hereby referred to as SCP-1106-1, in the majority of all cases will develop normally and be indistinguishable from a naturally born human.

Nonetheless, in a small portion of cases (about █%), instances of SCP-1106-1 will be born with marked defects.  Recorded defects include SCP-1106-1 being born with abnormal numbers of limbs, being born without skin, being born with the █████████ system positioned outside of the body, and potentially dangerous deviations in [DATA EXPUNGED] coupled with a significant increase in aggression.  Most notably, one instance of SCP-1106-1 was discovered to be emitting a remarkably high level of gamma radiation, forcing the immediate vicinity to be evacuated.
