**Item #:** SCP-726-EX

**Object Class:** Explained

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-726-EX is kept in a low-priority secure objects locker. 

**Description:** SCP-726-EX is a metal dowsing rod made of copper and bound with grey gaffer tape. The object was allegedly capable of detecting anomalies, but has since been labelled non-anomalous and reclassified as Explained.

**Discovery:** SCP-726-EX was first discovered by security personnel which apprehended two trespassers utilizing the object on the above-ground portion of Site-55. The following document is an interview with the apprehended subjects.

&gt; **Interviewed:** Lucas Borges and Michael White
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewee:** Agent Nowak
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Both apprehended subjects were located wandering the grounds of the above-ground Site-55 cover location (a tinned food cannery).
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Nowak:** Alright. Let us begin. I want you two to know that you&#39;re not in trouble. At least not yet. I just need to know how you got onto this facility.
&gt; 
&gt; **Borges:** Are you some kind of G-man?
&gt; 
&gt; **White:** No, you idiot. What&#39;s a G-man doing in a food cannery? He&#39;s probably just pissed at us.
&gt; 
&gt; **Borges:** Oh shit, are you gonna call the cops?
&gt; 
&gt; **White:** Please don&#39;t call the cops. We can pay for the hole we cut in the fence.
&gt; 
&gt; **Nowak:** Focus, boys. 
&gt; 
&gt; **White:** Well... we, uh... we cut a hole through your fence.
&gt; 
&gt; **Nowak:** I&#39;m well aware of that, what I want to know is what compelled you to two to come in here. There are very clear no entry signs all over the place. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Borges:** We were just following the thing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Nowak:** This thing? //[Nowak holds up SCP-726-EX]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Borges:** Yeah.
&gt; 
&gt; **Nowak:** Why were you following this object?
&gt; 
&gt; //[Both are quiet for ten seconds.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Nowak:** If you don&#39;t answer I&#39;m afraid I will have to call the police.
&gt; 
&gt; **White:** No! Don&#39;t do that!
&gt; 
&gt; **Borges:** Please don&#39;t! We&#39;ll talk. But you gotta promise not to laugh.
&gt; 
&gt; **Nowak:** I can&#39;t make such promises. But do go on.
&gt; 
&gt; **White:** We... we were looking for paranormal things.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Borges nods in agreement. Both eagerly look at Nowak.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Nowak:** Looking for... paranormal things? And this thing... //[Nowak holds up SCP-726-EX again]// ... led you here?
&gt; 
&gt; **White:** Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Nowak:** I see. Give me a moment, boys.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Nowak exits the interrogation room and hands SCP-726-EX to Agent Roarke. Agent Roarke is instructed to take the object to Inbound Object Processing for examination and analysis. Nowak returns to the interrogation room.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Nowak:** Now, where were we... Ah, yes. I&#39;m going to have to ask a few more questions.
&gt; 
&gt; **Borges:** Aww, come on mister. Please just let us go. We didn&#39;t do anything bad!
&gt; 
&gt; **White:** Except cut a hole through your fence.
&gt; 
&gt; **Borges:** B-but we can pay for that!
&gt; 
&gt; **White:** Yeah! Come on, mister.
&gt; 
&gt; **Nowak:** Focus. //[Muttering]// God, I hate teenagers. 
&gt; 
&gt; **White:** Yes sir.
&gt; 
&gt; **Borges:** Yes sir.
&gt; 
&gt; **Nowak:** I want you to tell me how you came across this object. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Borges:** We bought it from this weird old dude.
&gt; 
&gt; **White:** Yeah, we met him on the Parawatch dot net forums.
&gt; 
&gt; **Nowak:** Parawatch? Please explain what that is.
&gt; 
&gt; **White:** It&#39;s a website dedicated to hunting the paranormal.
&gt; 
&gt; **Nowak:** And this old man... what is his name?
&gt; 
&gt; //[There is a five-second silence.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Nowak:** Don&#39;t make me call the police.
&gt; 
&gt; **White:** I don&#39;t know his name.
&gt; 
&gt; **Borges:** Yeah, he never told us. I promise. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Nowak:** Surely you know his online handle then. Also, you boys should be more careful about meeting strangers from the internet.
&gt; 
&gt; **Borges:** His username was foghat 64[[footnote]] foghat64 was assigned as PoI-1221. Locating and containing PoI-1221 was then considered a Beta-Level priority. [[/footnote]] or something like that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Nowak:** Like the band?
&gt; 
&gt; **White:** What band?
&gt; 
&gt; **Nowak:** Oh, nevermind. So let me get this straight. You came here because you were following that object which you got from an old man that you met online.
&gt; 
&gt; **Borges:** Yes sir.
&gt; 
&gt; **Nowak:** How... reckless of you. 
&gt; 
&gt; **White:** We promise we won&#39;t do it again.
&gt; 
&gt; **Borges:** Yeah, promise. And we&#39;ll pay for your fence too. We&#39;re really sorry.
&gt; 
&gt; **White:** Really sorry.
&gt; 
&gt; **Nowak:** I won&#39;t call the police. But I will be doing this.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Nowak presses a button underneath the table. Two aides carrying amnestic tabs enter the room.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **White:** What is that? You&#39;re not gonna make us take drugs, are you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Borges:** What kind of factory is this?!
&gt; 
&gt; **Nowak:** Just something to ensure the events of tonight don&#39;t get to anyone who shouldn&#39;t be hearing about them.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Borges and White resist amnestization.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **White:** What the hell, dude? Help! Somebody help!
&gt; 
&gt; **Borges:** We&#39;re being forced to take drugs! Help!
&gt; 
&gt; //[The aides produce anesthetic solutions from their pockets and proceed to inject Borges and White.]//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;END LOG&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Afterword:** Borges and White were deposited in White&#39;s car and placed on the city outskirts. False memory 25-E (Party Fade-out) implanted.

**Addendum 726.01:** The following are logs of the Inbound Object Processing Department regarding SCP-726-EX.

**Addendum 726.02:** The following log is a recorded conversation between Lead SCP-726-EX Researcher Chambers and Containment Director Kirby. 

&gt; **Foreword:** PoI-1221 (&#34;foghat64&#34;) was located and interviewed by Foundation agents. No anomalous activity or allegiance was found. This prompted further investigation into SCP-726-EX to determine if anomalous properties were present in the object.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Kirby:** Chambers.
&gt; 
&gt; **Chambers:** Kirby.
&gt; 
&gt; **Kirby:** I assume you know why we&#39;re here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Chambers:** I read your email. What&#39;s your issue with my dowsing rod?
&gt; 
&gt; **Kirby:** I don&#39;t think it works.
&gt; 
&gt; **Chambers:** Bullshit. It works. I&#39;ve seen it with my own two eyes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Kirby:** Have you actually tested the damn thing?
&gt; 
&gt; **Chambers:** Of course I have. It pointed out anomalies with no problem.
&gt; 
&gt; **Kirby:** Take a look at this.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Kirby places a file on the table. Chambers reaches forward to grab it.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Kirby:** PoI-1221 came back clean. They&#39;re as baseline as it gets. Only thing anomalous about them is how much he sweat when we questioned him about the kids.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Chambers rifles through the attached files.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Chambers:** That doesn&#39;t change the fact that this thing works.
&gt; 
&gt; **Kirby:** You tested it in a facility full of anomalies. Of course it&#39;s going to point at one, it&#39;s a fucking dowsing rod. Those things are pseudoscience at best and shmuck-bait at worst, and those kids got played for schmucks. What&#39;s worse is we&#39;re getting played for schmucks now because of your insistence that it works.
&gt; 
&gt; **Chambers:** Then how do you explain how they got in here?
&gt; 
&gt; **Kirby:** Anybody can wander onto the top level of the Site. It&#39;s by the highway, for crying out loud. Just admit you were wrong about the thing and we can all move on.
&gt; 
&gt; **Chambers:** You&#39;re telling me this was all a big coincidence.
&gt; 
&gt; **Kirby:** Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Chambers:** But... I saw it respond to anomalies right in front of my eyes!
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Kirby:** Oh geez. Here we go again. They are simply responding to the random movements of whoever was holding them. You twitch and they move. Think of it this way, you&#39;re in a facility full of anomalies.  Where does the god damn thing have to point for it //not// to point to an anomaly?
&gt; 
&gt; //[There is a ten-second silence.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Chambers:** The ground, sir.
&gt; 
&gt; **Kirby:** God damn it, George.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;END LOG&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Afterword:** Following 20 more minutes of conversation (redacted for brevity) Lead Researcher Chambers conceded and the object was formally reclassified as Explained.
