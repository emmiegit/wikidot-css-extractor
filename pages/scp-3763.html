**Item #:** SCP-3763

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3763 is to be stored in the Anomalous Vehicle Containment Center at Site-48. All maintenance of SCP-3763 must be completed with the knowledge and consent of SCP-3763-1.

SCP-3763-1 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-48. As SCP-3763-1 believes it is in the custody of Marshall, Carter and Dark LLP, all personnel working with SCP-3763-1 are to maintain this deception by any means necessary. SCP-3763-1 is allowed access to approved entertainment material in exchange for its cooperation during testing of SCP-3763. 

**Description:** SCP-3763 is a 1964 Chevrolet Biscayne sedan. The vehicle is installed with a &#34;Thalbrum Vehicle Security System&#34;, believed to be the source of its anomalous effects. Otherwise, SCP-3763 will operate in a non-anomalous manner.

SCP-3763-1 is a young European-American adult male by the name of Daniel Thalbrum. SCP-3763-1 is legally recognized as the owner of SCP-3763, and therefore possesses complete control of its properties. SCP-3763-1 has stated that the &#34;vehicle security system&#34; SCP-3763 is installed with is the invention of Howard Thalbrum, SCP-3763-1&#39;s deceased father.

SCP-3763 presents a memetic effect on any individuals attempting to interact with the vehicle without the permission of SCP-3763-1. Said individuals will experience an anomalous unwillingness to make contact with SCP-3763 when within a radius of three meters. When asked why, affected individuals will cite the &#34;security system&#34; as the reason for their refusal. SCP-3763-1 is immune to these effects, and is able to cancel the memetic effect on others by giving verbal or written consent for affected individuals to interact with SCP-3763. 

In the event that a substance is ejected towards SCP-3763, an invisible barrier will materialize, covering the outermost surfaces of SCP-3763, and suspended around it by approximately 3 centimeters. This barrier will deflect all materials and objects thrown at SCP-3763. Said materials will be able to make contact with SCP-3763 with the consent of SCP-3763-1.
------
**Discovery:** The existence of SCP-3763 was uncovered on 7/22/2010 by intercepting communications between employees of Marshall, Carter and Dark LLP regarding a &#34;Thalbrum Vehicle Security System.&#34; A prototype would be transferred to MC&amp;D representatives at St. Everetts Memorial Hospital in Laurel Creek, California on 7/24/2010. SCP-3763-1 would accompany the vehicle on behalf of the late inventor. 

The Foundation was able to intercept this delivery by posing as MC&amp;D representatives, and deceiving SCP-3763-1 into turning over SCP-3763 to the Foundation. Due to SCP-3763-1 giving permission to interact with SCP-3763 as needed, delivery to Site-48 was successful. 
------
**Interview Log:** The following interview was completed shortly after the arrival of SCP-3763-1 into Foundation custody.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Show Interview Log&#34; hide=&#34;- Hide Interview Log&#34;]]

&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-3763-1
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Researcher Terrance Tsai
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Tsai:** Hello, Mr. Thalbrum. My name is Terrance Tsai, and I am here today for your orientation as a honorary employee of Marshall, Carter and Dark Limited Liability Partnership.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3763-1:** Hi, sir. Please, call me Daniel. It&#39;s nice to meet you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Tsai:** I have heard that your late father, Howard, invented a revolutionary new vehicle security system. Do you know how it works?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3763-1:** Nah. My dad liked to keep secrets, especially around my mom, when she was still around.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Tsai:** Do you mind if we run a few tests on the prototype vehicle? We&#39;ll need to see how the security system works before we can... um... put it out on the market.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3763-1:** Yeah, sure. Just don&#39;t crash it, it&#39;s actually my dad&#39;s first car. He had it since his teens. It&#39;s like a piece of him is still around, you know?
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Tsai:** Thank you for your cooperation, Daniel. Another representative will meet you in here, and show you to your new room.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** [After this interview, SCP-3763-1 was taken to its containment chamber.]

**Test Logs:** The following is an incomplete list of experiments regarding SCP-3763.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Show Test Logs&#34; hide=&#34;- Hide Test Logs&#34;]]

&gt; **__Test 3763-01__**
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedure:** D-3578 was instructed to enter SCP-3763 without permission from SCP-3763-1.
&gt; 
&gt; **Results:** As D-3578 approached SCP-3763, he became apprehensive about his instructions, and refused to make contact with SCP-3763. When asked why, D-3578 cited the &#34;security system&#34; as his reason. SCP-3763-1, who was watching the experiment, then gave verbal permission to D-3578 to enter SCP-3763. D-3578 complied with the original instructions, and sat in the front passenger seat of SCP-3763.
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** //This security system appears to be a memetic hazard, and may not actually provide physical security for SCP-3763. -Researcher Xiao//

&gt; **__Test 3763-02__**
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedure:** D-6550 and D-4389 were both instructed to enter SCP-3763 without permission from SCP-3763-1.
&gt; 
&gt; **Results:** D-6550 and D-4389 both refused to interact with SCP-3763. When SCP-3763-1 gave verbal consent, both personnel entered SCP-3763.
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** //SCP-3763 possesses the ability to affect multiple people at once. -Dr. Ficarra//

&gt; **__Test 3763-04__**
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedure:** Researcher Wendyl Wong attempted to operate SCP-3763 around a testing track at Site-48, in order to measure possible performance discrepancies due to its anomalous effects.
&gt; 
&gt; **Results:** With the approval of SCP-3763-1, Researcher Wong entered SCP-3763, but refused to drive the vehicle. SCP-3763-1 had to give additional permission for Researcher Wong to drive SCP-3763. No discrepancies in performance were recorded.

&gt; **__Test 3763-05__**
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedure:** An open bucket of red paint was thrown onto SCP-3763 by a mechanical arm, as no personnel were willing to throw the paint themselves. SCP-3763-1 was not informed of this test.
&gt; 
&gt; **Results:** The paint was repelled away from the surface of SCP-3763 by an unseen obstruction. The paint, including the bucket, did not contact SCP-3763.
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** //In the event that contact with SCP-3763 seems unavoidable, the vehicle will be able to divert the materials in another direction to avoid contact. -Dr. Srivastava//

&gt; **__Test 3763-08__**
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedure:** Two machine guns were mounted onto mechanical arms, and instructed to fire upon SCP-3763. SCP-3763-1 was not informed of this test.
&gt; 
&gt; **Results:** All bullets with a trajectory towards SCP-3763 halted in mid-air about 2 meters from the vehicle, and fell to the ground. No damage to SCP-3763 was recorded.
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** //There appears to be a unique effect on firearms, as the bullets stopped farther away from SCP-3763 than other materials, and did not bounce away. -Dr. Boudames//

&gt; **__Test 3763-10__**
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedure:** Foundation mechanic Nathanial Knapp attempted to wash SCP-3763 and change its oil and tires. Knapp was not informed of SCP-3763&#39;s anomalous properties.
&gt; 
&gt; **Results:** When in close proximity to SCP-3763, Knapp was suddenly unwilling to perform maintenance, citing his &#34;lack of experience&#34; with vintage cars. SCP-3763-1 had to give written permission for Knapp to perform the necessary repairs. When attempting to spray water onto SCP-3763 for a wash, Knapp reported that the water instead accumulated on the invisible barrier, giving the appearance of floating puddles. SCP-3763-1 had to issue permission for the water to make contact with SCP-3763. When Knapp attempted to pour oil into the engine, the invisible barrier repelled the oil, resulting in the oil entering Knapp&#39;s orifices. Knapp was sent to the infirmary, and all repairs were cancelled.

&gt; **__Test 3763-14__**
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedure:** A Ford F-650 would be driven towards SCP-3763 to measure the ability of its invisible barrier. As no personnel were willing to operate the vehicle themselves, a bipedal automaton would drive instead. SCP-3763-1 was not informed of this test. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Results:** When the test vehicle reached a distance of 25 meters from SCP-3763, its front fascia caved in and both axles locked up. The vehicle halted to a complete stop 3 meters from SCP-3763. The test vehicle was successfully repaired after this experiment. No damage was recorded on SCP-3763.

**Addendum:** Following the initial containment of SCP-3763, a raid was conducted on the former Thalbrum family apartment in an effort to retrieve information regarding SCP-3763. While no such information was found, two letters were discovered, having been sent between SCP-3763-1 and Howard Thalbrum, who was staying at the St. Everetts Memorial Hospital when the letters were written. Both letters have been transcribed below.

    Hey Dad,

I want you to know that I&#39;m doing okay. I&#39;m sorry that I&#39;m not able to see you. However, I&#39;m able to write this letter to you.

I know a lot is going on right now. The people at Marshall, Carter and Dark are probably trying to get you to sign something. I just want you to know that I still love you, and I always will. If I could visit you, I would, but I&#39;m just really busy right now, with school and all. 

I heard the news about your cancer. They told me you only have a few weeks left. That has to be scary, and I can&#39;t imagine the pain you must be going through.

Look, I know I wasn&#39;t the best person I could&#39;ve been. I could&#39;ve studied more and hung out with better people. When I heard about your diagnosis, I admit I was a bit self centered in how I responded. I worried about //me//, about how I would survive without either of my parents. But now I realize that I should&#39;ve worried about //you// instead. I should&#39;ve been there for you, to comfort you as your last days ticked away. I should&#39;ve reminded you about the things you built, the lasting impact your inventions would have. But instead I just shunned you. I didn&#39;t even think of visiting until now, when I can&#39;t anymore.

I have so much regret I want to express, all the pain and lost time I&#39;ll never get back. The memories I could&#39;ve made with you after Mom left, they never happened. I wanted to follow my own path, ignoring the man who took care of me by himself. 

I just want to say that I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m sorry for ignoring you, I&#39;m sorry that I can&#39;t see you anymore, I&#39;m sorry about how I wasn&#39;t there for you. I hope you can forgive me.

I love you.

Your son, 
Daniel Thalbrum

= **Saint Everetts Memorial Hospital**
= Patient Memo, 5-14-2010

To Daniel,

Thank you for writing a letter. You never were good at writing letters anyway, so it&#39;s good that you are practicing.

While I am disappointed that you are unable to visit your old man, I am still grateful to hear from you. I have been working well with Marshall, Carter, and Dark LLP regarding my invention.

I appreciate your longing to have spent more time with me, and to be honest, many of the activities you partook in disappointed me. However, I admit that I did not make a big effort to connect with you more, as I was focused on my invention. I should&#39;ve tried to be more of an influence in your life, instead of chasing riches that I know I&#39;ll never get. It took a cancer diagnosis for me to appreciate the time I have left, but I&#39;m glad that you don&#39;t need such an event to happen to yourself to appreciate life.

After your mother left, I became more focused on my pet project. As a result, I neglected my role as a father in your life, as I was obsessed with success and fortune. Now that I&#39;ve found an investor, I won&#39;t even be able to enjoy any wealth that my invention brings me. I&#39;m still going with the contract in order to set up a royalty system for you, and your future. The money&#39;s going to have to go to someone, after all. I just want you to remember that time is short, and there&#39;s only so much to do. I want you to do great things with the money, and benefit many people.

I suppose that&#39;s all I have to write to you. I&#39;ve also put in my will that full ownership of my Biscayne will go to you as well. Oh, and I also accept your apology.

Goodbye, my son. I&#39;ll see you some other day. I love you too.

Howard F. Thalbrum
