**Author&#39;s Thoughts:**

[[collapsible show=&#34;+SCP-3480- Olympus Mons&#34; hide=&#34;-Hide&#34;]]
[[[SCP-3480 |SCP-3480 - Olympus Mons]]]
Oddly enough, this was originally inspired by a random pic of Olympus that was posted to r/europe. For some reason, it inspired me to take the leap and write a skip about Olympus, joining this fine community of writers. 

The exact process of plotting this one out was messy, but in the end I&#39;m very happy with it. Also serves as a nice homage to SCP-2000, my personal favorite skip. I&#39;m quite happy that my first skip did relatively well, and considering I did a major re-write a few weeks after the initial post I&#39;m confident it could have done even better. I chose the number to reference the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+SCP-3108- The Nerfing Gun&#34; hide=&#34;-Hide&#34;]]
[[[SCP-3108|SCP-3108- The Nerfing Gun]]]
This is a light article I wrote based on a discussion Lefarsi and I were having in an SCP discord. It started off as a collab, but unfortunately Lefarsi had to stop due to irl business.

I had a hell of a time finishing this. I actually posted it once and self deleted, before doing a re-write. Connecting it to GAW happened pretty late in the process, but I think it wound up working well. 108 doesn&#39;t have any special significance for this skip, but it is my favorite number.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+SCP-3602- The Monkey King&#39;s Legacy&#34; hide=&#34;-Hide&#34;]]
[[[SCP-3602 |SCP-3602- The Monkey King&#39;s Legacy]]]
After I scrapped a long and disastrous draft about a Sealand-based skip, I decided to write something more simple. Inspired by my love of Chinese culture and Journey to the West, I decided to write about a loose end from the novel: the monkeys that Wukong made immortal before leaving them to become a Buddha with Xuanzang.

I&#39;m happy with how it turned out. Ultimately, the ideas expressed were not anything revolutionary, but I think I executed a simple tale about immortality and abandonment quite well. The number 3602 was chosen to reference Xuanzang&#39;s birth year, and thus the individual who would deprive the monkeys of their king.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;+SCP-3221- Prester John the Unbroken&#34; hide=&#34;-Hide&#34;]]
[[[SCP-3221 |SCP-3221- Prester John the Unbroken]]]
This skip was originally something my coauthor Tufto was working on, based on the irl legend of Prester John. I was interested in collaborating with him on it, and after he grew dissatisfied with the initial draft he passed it on to me. Originally, the story was much more about ORIA dealing with a parasitic dimension, and it had no sarkic and less broken god elements. Inspired by the cannibalism and the previous mekhanite usage, I retooled it into a demagogue using both faiths as a way to gain power. Hong Xiuquan&#39;s Taiping Rebellion and the theophagy theme of sarkicism both proved instrumental.

The number is chosen in reference to the year 1221, in which a letter claiming Prester John had acheived a great victory over the Muslims reached the west.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+SCP-3934- For Sale: Loch Ness Monsters&#34; hide=&#34;-Hide&#34;]]
[[[SCP-3934 |SCP-3934- For Sale: Loch Ness Monsters]]]
We didn&#39;t have a nessie skip and I wanted to be the one to write it. The whole thing is an allegory for the exotic pet industry. I was kinda hoping it would become really popular because of Nessie, but I suppose it&#39;s done alright.

The number is chosen in reference to the year 1934, when the famous Surgeon&#39;s photo was taken.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+SCP-3304- That Time the Foundation Froze Hell&#34; hide=&#34;-Hide&#34;]]
[[[SCP-3304 |SCP-3304- That Time the Foundation Froze Hell]]]
The original idea for this came from Hippo in a chat discussion, though I changed it around to be more of a comedic feghoot than the original concept. I also tied in the Ars Goetia demons via the character of Raum. This is my most divisive skip so far as many people feel it&#39;s too silly, but at the end of the day more people liked it than disliked it.

The number is chosen in reference to the area code of West Virginia, 304.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+Sic Semper Tyrannis&#34; hide=&#34;-Hide&#34;]]
[http://www.scp-wiki.net/sic-semper-tyrannis Sic Semper Tyrannis]
I wrote this for Perelka as part of the secret santa, and I&#39;m really happy that they liked it so much. I think my own inexperience writing tales hurt me a bit here when it came to describing scenes, and I definitely relied upon pre-existing character development to help speed the interactions along. Even so, I&#39;m happy with how it turned out. 
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;+SCP-3940- Biblical Vengeance Upon Bugs Bunny&#34; hide=&#34;-Hide&#34;]]
[[[SCP-3940 |SCP-3940- Biblical Vengeance Upon Bugs Bunny]]]
I&#39;m pretty proud of this one, and I think it might be the most witty thing I&#39;ve written. I mean hell, a comedic murder mystery based on an irl etymological curiosity caused by Looney Toons? My kinda weird right there. That&#39;s why I&#39;m very disappointed it got buried in the sea of jam contest entries. That said, I&#39;m at least happy that a lot of the people who read it really enjoyed it. Maybe one of these days it&#39;ll get the attention I think it deserves.

The name is a reference to the air year of //A Fresh Hare//, the cartoon short that introduced Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+Apotheosis Series&#34; hide=&#34;-Hide&#34;]]
A New Age of Magic was a blast to write, and I&#39;m also proud of my smaller contributions to 3731 and Thrive. Working on a team with three such talented friends as Weryllium, fieldstone, and CadaverCommander was an amazing experience. I never expected that we&#39;d win the contest going into it, but I&#39;m proud as hell that we did.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+SCP-4002- The Black Moon Howls From Beyond The Edge of Time&#34; hide=&#34;-Hide&#34;]]
[[[SCP-4002 |SCP-4002- The Black Moon Howls From Beyond The Edge of Time]]]
MayD has always been a great friend and mentor of mine in this community, so I was very happy to jump on board when she asked if I wanted to collab on a 4k entry. Turning the unfinished myth of Etana into an SCP was something I struggled with for a long time, with 4002 essentially being a massive remake of an 001 concept I&#39;d brainstormed a year earlier. MayD and I were both busy as hell during June and July, but I think we managed to make a great piece that spoke to a lot of people and celebrated lots of obscure site lore. We actually posted it 18 seconds before the contest deadline!

The name is a reference to the last x000 contest entry tretter wrote, [[[SCP-3002]]].

[[collapsible show=&#34;+SCP-4034- Defenetre of the Strate&#34; hide=&#34;-Hide&#34;]]
[[[SCP-4034 |SCP-4034- Defenetre of the Strate]]
This collab started when Kirby wanted to do a skip inspired by the Defenestration of Prague, but his original draft lacked a certain historical pizazz. I offered to co-write it with him, and together we created this piece. I definitely owe Kirby an apology here, as I was busy as hell during the months after we decided to do this and its finish was delayed immensely. Despite that, I&#39;m proud of what were able to create together.

The number was chosen by Kirby for this one.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+SCP-5999- This is How I Died&#34; hide=&#34;-Hide&#34;]]
[[SCP-5999 |SCP-5999- Seven]]
Shaggy invited me to join his 5000 project, and I&#39;m immensely proud of the results. Shaggy was the leader and mvp of the project, producing most of the writing. Sherm and Volgun made media, Woed coded some impressive css, and I wrote one of the seven storylets. Together, we made something truly special and I&#39;m ecstatic that it wound up coming in second in such a high profile contest.

My contribution specifically was the interview log, in which a supposedly possessed Foundation agent is undergoing an exorcism. But not all is as it seems.

The number was chosen by Shaggy for this one.
