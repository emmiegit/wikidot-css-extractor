**Item #:** SCP-500

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-500 must be stored in a cool and dry place away from bright light. SCP-500 is only allowed to be accessed by personnel with level 4 security clearance to prevent misapplication.

**Description:** SCP-500 is a small plastic can which at the time of writing contains forty-seven (47) red pills. One pill, when taken orally, effectively cures the subject of all diseases within two hours, exact time depending on the severity and amount of the subject&#39;s conditions. Despite extensive trials, all attempts at synthesizing more of what is thought to be the active ingredient of the pills have been unsuccessful.

&gt; **Note From Dr. Klein:**
&gt; SCP personnel below Level 3 are now banned from handling SCP-500. This is not to be used to cure a hangover. Get AIDS and then ask permission.


**Request 500-1774-k** 
Dr. [500-0022F] has requested one (1) SCP-500 pill for testing with [[[SCP-038]]]. Request has been approved.

**Request 500-1862-b**
Dr. Gears has requested one (1) SCP-500 pill for testing in [[[SCP-914]]].  Request has been approved.

**Request 500-2354-f**
Dr. █████████ has requested one (1) SCP-500 pill for testing with [[[SCP-253]]]. Request denied.

**Request 500-5667-e**
Dr. Gibbons has requested two (2) pills of SCP-500 for his personal medkit. Request denied.

**Addendum 500-1:** Two (2) pills have been authorized for use with [[[SCP-008]]]. As a result of conducting a series of tests on Class D subjects infected with SCP-008, it appears that even in the most advanced stages of the disease one whole pill will accomplish full recovery. Number of pills is fifty-seven (57) at the time of writing. - Dr. [500-0021D]

**Addendum 500-2:** One (1) pill has been authorized for use with [[[SCP-409]]]. SCP-500 was tested on Subject 409-D5 who was exposed to the effects of [[[SCP-409]]].  Complete recovery accomplished. See Addendum 409-1. Number of pills is fifty-six (56) at the time of writing. - Dr. [500-0021D]

**Addendum 500-4:** Request 500-1774-k approved. Five (5) pills have been used in experimentation with [[[SCP-038]]]. It has been determined that SCP-038 is capable of duplicating SCP-500; however, the success of the duplicated pills is limited.  The duplicated pills are only effective in curing the subject 30% of the time, with chance of successful healing dropping as time since cloned increases. In 60% of the cases where the infection is permanent, symptoms of infection remain, though further infestation is neutralized.  Repeated dosing with SCP-038 cloned pills is recommended for all personnel suffering from incurable conditions, as supply of SCP-500 remains extremely limited. All five (5) used samples of SCP-500 were returned. Number of pills is fifty-six (56) at the time of writing.

**Addendum 500-5:** During experiments with SCP-038, one (1) pill was stolen by personnel D-██████ to, reportedly, &#34;cure a hangover&#34;. Stricter controls for samples of SCP-500 given to other projects is suggested. Personnel D-██████ has been terminated. Number of pills is fifty-five (55) at the time of writing.

**Addendum 500-6:** One (1) pill has been used with [[[SCP-231|SCP-231-4]]]. Number of pills is fifty-four (54) at the time of writing.

**Addendum 500-7**: One (1) pill has been used for [[[ experiment-log-447-a | Experiment 447-a]]]. Number of pills is fifty-three (53) at the time of writing.

**Addendum 500-8:** One (1) pill has been used with [[[SCP-208]]]. Number of pills is fifty-two (52) at the time of writing.

**Addendum 500-9:** Request 500-1862-b approved. One (1) pill of SCP-500 is placed within [[[SCP-914]]] with the setting at &#34;Fine&#34;. Resulting object classified as [[[SCP-427]]]. Number of pills is fifty-one (51) at the time of writing.

**Addendum 500-10:** Five (5) pills have been taken for the [[[Olympia Project]]] although only two (2) were used. The remaining three (3) will be returned shortly. Upon return, number of pills will be forty-nine (49).

**Addendum 500-11:** Two (2) pills have been used for Experiment 217-█████-█████. Number of pills is forty-seven (47) at the time of writing.

**Addendum 500-12:** Request to have SCP-500 investigated for mental compulsion leading to obsessive fixation denied for triviality.
