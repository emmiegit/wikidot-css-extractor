&gt; **Foreword:** The SCP Foundation has discovered a substantial number of items which are simply too useless to merit further attention. This document lists those items which have prompted some curiosity. It may be used as a resource should knowledge of these items become useful or necessary in the future.  
&gt; – Dr. █████ █████, Head of Research, Site-██
 
This is the third volume of the log. Due to the increasing number of items discovered by the Foundation, this list is no longer open to new entries. For ease of archival, [[[log-of-anomalous-items | first]]], [[[log-of-anomalous-items-vol-ii | second]]] and [[[log-of-anomalous-items-vol-iv | fourth]]] volumes of this log have been made available, and the [[[log-of-anomalous-items-vol-v | fifth]]] remains open to new additions.

Lists of [[[log-of-extranormal-events| Extranormal Events]]] and [[[log-of-unexplained-locations| Unexplained Locations]]] have also been compiled.

**Item Description:** A standard wooden garden rake that causes all sapient beings in a 10-meter range around it to be compelled to step on its teeth, receiving the handle in the face or equivalent of such at a high velocity. Doing so permanently inoculates the affected individual to the item&#39;s effects but also acts as a short range amnestic, as subjects express surprise when hit by the handle and are unable to identify its anomalous properties, sincerely believing they stepped on the teeth by accident.
**Date of Recovery:** 5-16-2020
**Location of Recovery:** Spontaneously manifested in a hallway on Site-██. Recovered after an estimated 23 personnel members were exposed to its effects during an SCP-███ containment breach, significantly slowing down the handling of the breach and causing the death of ██ personnel.

**Current Status:** Kept in a drawer in the office of ████ ██, Site-19&#39;s Head Relationship Psychologist, for use in resolving or preventing conflicts between staff stemming from staff members&#39; biases towards women. May be transferred to other sites per request with ████ ██&#39;s approval.

**Item Description and Current Status:** So, we&#39;ve got a fella in a humanoid containment cell that can only be described usin&#39; informal vernacular - you can&#39;t talk about &#39;im using any sort&#39;a upper-crust &#34;clinical&#34; terminology, in other words. The guy himself doesn&#39;t seem to know that he&#39;s an anomaly - ol&#39; Dr. Umen wants to feed &#39;im amnestics and let &#39;im go, considerin&#39; that he&#39;s not a threat to normalcy or anythin&#39;.
**Date of Recovery:** We got &#39;im back on May 30, 2020.
**Location of Recovery:** Down in a city near - actually, we can&#39;t tell you any a that considerin&#39; that it&#39;s top secret or somethin&#39;.

Evidence suggests that these episodes are made by Bob Ross and are broadcasted from Corbenic.
**Date of Recovery:** Ongoing.
**Location of Recovery:** Each episode will randomly replace an advertisement slot of sufficient length on the █████████ network. A Foundation bot has been installed to reroute these episodes to the Foundation database and fill the empty time slot with the original programming.
**Current Status:** Currently available to all Foundation staff to increase morale, painting supplies are available in the break room at Site-██ for use during breaks.
**Note:** //On ██/██/████, an episode was rerouted into the Foundation database and reviewed as per procedure, but instead of starting in usual fashion, Bob Ross said the following: &#34;Hello to my friends at the SCP Foundation, while I am sad that you won&#39;t let me continue painting for the world I understand why, and I am happy that my show will continue to bring joy to members of the Foundation and even someone as important as O5-█. With all that out of the way I&#39;d like to thank you all for joining me here this week, if this is your first time watching the Joy of Painting, I&#39;d like to extend a personal invitation for you to pull out your paints and join me, for a relaxing half hour of painting, and I&#39;ll show you just how easy it is to make some of the most beautiful art you&#39;ve ever seen.&#34; Episode continued as usual except for the painting, which was later confirmed to be a depiction of SCP-354.//

**Item Description:** A shipment of twelve █████████ brand acoustic guitars exhibiting the anomalous property that each of the guitar strings will not stop vibrating until manually stopped by use of a person’s finger, and that none of the parts can be damaged. Use of dead or non-biological material will not stop the vibration of the strings, and despite their immunity to damage, the parts still exhibit identical microscopic structures and properties as the materials of the original guitar models. The anomalous properties of the shipment are only exhibited if the original guitars from the shipment contain all of their original parts.

**Current Status:** Fused to a soundproofed locker.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Display containment history?&#34; hide=&#34;- Ready...&#34;]]



||~ Attempt at containment: ||~ Observed new properties: ||
|| Agent Acer bought a birdhouse as a present for his son, as he has an interest in avian biology and migration patterns. He place it in his personal car and attempted to drive it home || The object began to emit a low-energy electromagnetic field that disabled the vehicle&#39;s alternator. Once he realized that the item was the source of this malfunction and the car operated normally when it was removed, he classified it as an anomaly and carried it to a Foundation regional platform for basic testing. ||
|| The platform&#39;s containment specialists placed the object into a box with a pad-lock and ensured that it stayed fifteen meters from all sensitive equipment. || The field emitted by the object increased in size and severity until it began hindering site operations. ||
|| Under the assumption that the anomaly simply expanded over time, it scheduled to be brought off-site in a barren field with no electronics. || The object physically increased in weight to the point where it could not be moved with on-site machinery. The exact new weight was not measured, but theorized to be over .5 tons. Notably at this point it stopped influencing electronics, causing staff to reconsider its properties.|| 
|| Dr. Fredricks from Site-23 was called and informed of the situation. He determined that the object was altering itself to evade containment by the Foundation, and suggested giving it to another group capable of containment. || The item returned to normal weight at some point during the conversation, and logistic staff begin preparing to transport the object to a local access point of the Wander&#39;s Library[[footnote]] A division of beings from the library notably //not// loyal to the Serpent&#39;s Hand. [[/footnote]]. However, mid-transport it began to telepathically transmit a view from out its circular opening to the assigned agents. As this would constitute a security breach for the library, it was not accepted into their establishment. ||
|| The birdhouse was physically placed in a soundproofed chamber which itself was placed in a larger, more powerful soundproofed chamber so that the object would gain a new hazard that only bypassed the first chamber. || The object was successfully place within the first chamber and started emitting sounds of bird songs with the cognitohazardous properties, causing staff to forget the code to lock the larger chamber, leaving it locked and unable to be closed. ||
|| Once again, Dr. Fredricks was contacted via the phone and became agitated, explaining that this anomaly was wasting his time and all containment measures were simply making it more dangerous. He unofficially suggested that it would &#34;probably be better to let the little shit go at this point.&#34; || The object&#39;s wood fused with the inner containment locker, all attempts to bring it out of containment have since failed. It is theorized that Dr. Fredricks accidentally made the current containment procedures intentionally not containing the item, thus making its ongoing containment a breach. ||


[[/collapsible]]

//Note: It has been suggested that the object&#39;s containment be modified in such a way that it is manipulated to gain new properties which would benefit the Foundation, however, other similar anomalies with actual SCP classifications would be better suited for this role and as such these suggestions are not being implemented at the time of writing.//

**Item Description:** A T-shirt, men&#39;s size medium, showing nothing more than a black symbol against a white background. The symbol appears to be some form of glyph, but merely looking at the symbol causes pain. This effect manifests as mild eyestrain after 10 seconds of exposure and escalates in severity, becoming a migraine after only 7 minutes. The longest anyone has been able to view the symbol was 12 minutes and 40 seconds. The viewer, a sufferer of cluster headaches, claimed that it was the worst pain she&#39;d ever experienced. Other than the symbol, the item is non-anomalous.
**Date of Recovery:** 3-6-2021
**Location of Recovery:** Found at a garage sale in Minneapolis, MN, under a pile of clothing, none of which has been found to be anomalous.

[[# hubert]]
**Item Description:**  A male humuhumunukunukuapuaʻa with nomenclative memetic properties that compel any individual attempting to communicate about said humuhumunukunukuapuaʻa to specifically refer to the aforementioned humuhumunukunukuapuaʻa as a humuhumunukunukuapuaʻa, rather than with an abbreviation or pronoun. The humuhumunukunukuapuaʻa has a pattern of bright blue pigmentation on the humuhumunukunukuapuaʻa&#39;s left side spelling the words &#34;Hubert the Hilarious Humuhumunukunukuapuaʻa, by Dr. Wondertainment&#34; in small letters. This designation appears as #08 in [[[scp-4225 | Document 4225-a]]]. Despite the humuhumunukunukuapuaʻa&#39;s name, the humuhumunukunukuapuaʻa does not appear to be anomalously funny. It is believed that the supposed &#34;hilarity&#34; was intended to arise from repeated usage of the word &#34;humuhumunukunukuapuaʻa&#34;, but all personnel have reported that it was only funny the first few times and increasingly annoying thereafter. --The underpaid research assistant who had to write &#34;humuhumunukunukuapuaʻa&#34; a hundred fucking times to fill out this stupid fucking entry about a stupid fucking humuhumunukunukuapuaʻa thoroughly agrees.--

**Item Description:** A T28 Superheavy tank, weighing roughly 90 tons, in well worn condition. The vehicle has a cognitohazardous effect that causes anyone that views it to see it as a large bush. The area covered by the perceived bush is not as large as the tank itself, meaning a person can walk into the tank while they believe that they are walking around a bush, at which point they become aware of the tank&#39;s presence; this is how the vehicle was discovered. The foundation subsequently administered amnestics to the affected individuals and replaced the vehicle with a non-anomalous reproduction.
