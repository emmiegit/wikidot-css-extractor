This document lists those items which have prompted some curiosity. It may be used as a resource should knowledge of these items become useful or necessary in the future.   – Dr. █████ █████, Head of Research, Site-██
 
This is the third volume of the log. Access to the first and second volume of the log can be found [[[log-of-anomalous-items|here]]] and [[[log-of-anomalous-items-vol-ii|here]]], respectively.
 
//**Note:** Please add new entries to the bottom of the list, not the middle or the top.//

**Location of Recovery:** In [REDACTED], near Bucharest, Romania.
**Current Status**: In Storage.
//Note: Ever since he figured out how to solve it, SCP-049 has been fascinated by the normal Rubik’s Cube. Some jokester suggested we give Oh-Four-Nine this little bugger to try to solve. Bad idea. 
-- Dr. ████, 03/11/1989//

**Item Description:** A black rectangle made of unknown composition with the inscription &#34;[REDACTED]&#34; (//Note: The word &#34;REDACTED&#34; in brackets is actually written on it, and is not an authentic act of redaction on the Foundation&#39;s part.//) on it, which, no matter the position of the person viewing it always displays itself as if they were directly in front of the item. Seems to be two-dimensional as opposed to the standard three dimensions.
**Date of Recovery:** 5-8-2020
**Location of Recovery:** A candy shop named &#34;Conifer&#39;s Confidential Confiserie&#34; that sold various CIA, ████ and Foundation-themed foods. Dismantled by the Foundation on ██/██/20██ after it was identified as a security breach.

**Note:** //What? I think it&#39;s pretty funny.//

**Item Description:** A red bath towel, slightly faded due to prolonged exposure to sunlight.  When worn around the neck of a human subject in the manner of a cape, the subject believes him/herself capable of flight.  Affected subjects often display strong desires to jump from high places in order to demonstrate this ability.
**Date of Recovery:** 11/5/2020
**Location of Recovery:** [REDACTED] Toy Store, Clifden, Ireland.
**Current Status:** In storage.
//Note: Wearing this item does not actually confer the power of flight.  Affected subjects should not be unobserved until the item has been removed, to prevent them from causing themselves accidental injury.//

**Item Description:** A standard wooden garden rake that causes all sapient beings in a 10-meter range around it to be compelled to step on its teeth, receiving the handle in the face or equivalent of such at a high velocity. Doing so permanently inoculates the affected individual to the item&#39;s effects but also acts as a short range amnestic, as subjects express surprise when hit by the handle and are unable to identify its anomalous properties, sincerely believing they stepped on the teeth by accident.
**Date of Recovery:** 5-16-2020
**Location of Recovery:** Spontaneously manifested in a hallway on Site-██. Recovered after an estimated 23 personnel members were exposed to its effects during an SCP-███ containment breach, significantly slowing down the handling of the breach and causing the death of ██ personnel.

The guy himself doesn&#39;t seem to know that he&#39;s an anomaly - ol&#39; Dr. Umen wants to feed &#39;im amnestics and let &#39;im go, considerin&#39; that he&#39;s not a threat to normalcy or anythin&#39;.
**Date of Recovery:** We got &#39;im back on May 30, 2020.
**Location of Recovery:** Down in a city near - actually, we can&#39;t tell you any a that considerin&#39; that it&#39;s top secret or somethin&#39;.

Evidence suggests that these episodes are made by Bob Ross and are broadcasted from Corbenic.
**Date of Recovery:** Ongoing.
**Location of Recovery:** Each episode will randomly replace an advertisement slot of sufficient length on the █████████ network. A Foundation bot has been installed to reroute these episodes to the Foundation database and fill the empty time slot with the original programming.
**Current Status:** Currently available to all Foundation staff to increase morale, painting supplies are available in the break room at Site-██ for use during breaks.
**Note:** //On ██/██/████, an episode was rerouted into the Foundation database and reviewed as per procedure, but instead of starting in usual fashion, Bob Ross said the following: &#34;Hello to my friends at the SCP Foundation, while I am sad that you won&#39;t let me continue painting for the world I understand why, and I am happy that my show will continue to bring joy to members of the Foundation and even someone as important as O5-█. With all that out of the way I&#39;d like to thank you all for joining me here this week, if this is your first time watching the Joy of Painting, I&#39;d like to extend a personal invitation for you to pull out your paints and join me, for a relaxing half hour of painting, and I&#39;ll show you just how easy it is to make some of the most beautiful art you&#39;ve ever seen.&#34; Episode continued as usual except for the painting, which was later confirmed to be a depiction of SCP-354.//

**Item Description:** A shipment of twelve █████████ brand acoustic guitars exhibiting the anomalous property that each of the guitar strings will not stop vibrating until manually stopped by use of a person’s finger, and that none of the parts can be damaged. Use of dead or non-biological material will not stop the vibration of the strings, and despite their immunity to damage, the parts still exhibit identical microscopic structures and properties as the materials of the original guitar models. The anomalous properties of the shipment are only exhibited if the original guitars from the shipment contain all of their original parts.

**Current Status:** In Site-19 Unknown/Unexplained Objects storage.

**Item Description:** A collection of kitchen equipment. Set includes pans, pots, cutlery, rolling pins, tongs etc. Any person within a four meter radius of the set will change visual perspective to that of a bird’s eye view of the kitchen à la &#34;Tasty&#34; instruction videos. Anomaly appears to follow majority of set; removing a single piece from the set does not bring the anomalous effect with said single piece. Effect wears off when walking away from set. No adverse effects to user besides mild disorientation. Outside observers have noted no change in behavior or physicality of users while interacting with the set.
**Date of Recovery:** 14/07/2018
**Location of Recovery:** ███ Bistro, Nashville, Tennesee.
**Current Status:** In Site-47 kitchen.

**Item Description:** A ███████ brand portable music player. Initials G.J. inscribed on the back in permanent black marker. If used to play any mp3 file containing a piece of music, the device will make demeaning remarks about the user&#39;s music taste in an unidentified male voice with a &#34;smug&#34; tone upon the conclusion of the piece, or whenever it is paused by the user. If any attempt is made to play a file in a lossless format, the device will fail to play the file, with the same voice proceeding to go on a long, expletive-filled rant scolding the user for being a &#34;pretentious audiophile&#34; in a noticeably angry tone. Recorded rant lengths range from five minutes to six and a half hours. No anomalous effects will manifest if used to play an mp3 file containing anything other than music.
**Date of Recovery:** 25/08/2019
**Location of Recovery:** ██████████ Used Electronics Store in Laredo, TX. Purchased by Dr. Fernán, prompting the discovery of its anomalous effects.

**Item Description:** A virtual reality gaming headset of independent make with one video game pre-installed and no possibility of importing other games. While the item is placed on a person&#39;s head and turned on, the subject is unable to vocalize voluntarily and is forced to intermittently vocalize a number of different phrases and exclamations shared by all subjects. The most common phrases include &#34;I&#39;m gaming&#34;, &#34;So this is immersion&#34; and &#34;I&#39;ve never really lived before.&#34; These vocalizations gradually increase in enthusiasm and become less articulated, culminating in wordless screaming. Subjects have described the video game installed on the object as &#34;an endless dishwashing cutscene where you can look around&#34;.
**Date of Recovery:** 07/14/2019
**Location of Recovery:** Offices of ████ ████████, an independent game studio in Dallas, Texas.

**Item Description:** A complete set of painting supplies titled, &#34;The Perfect Paint Kit&#34;. The paint tubes in the set don&#39;t ever seem to empty, despite being poured into a standard paint can built to hold a gallon of paint. The paint brushes are also highly resistant to damage and the bristles are unable to be bent in such a way that would &#34;ruin the paint brush&#34;, as claimed on the back end of the items&#39; original packaging. The paint brushes come to a total of 9, ranging from fine-tipped brushes, to more broad-lined brushes. The last item in the set, the water pail, always has 3 liters of water in it, and washing paint off the brushes in it doesn&#39;t change the color of the water.
**Date of Recovery:** 05-14-2017
**Location of Recovery:** Item was brought in by Researcher Daniel Ham after he purchased the item at a local crafts store. He discovered the anomalous nature of the item when the water pail had clean water in it, and the weight of the paint tubes hadn&#39;t changed. Interview with employees shows no one knows where the product shipped from, or its original manufacturer. All interviewed were amnesticized and released as per standard procedure. 
**Current Status:** In Site-██ break room, with paper and easel available for personal to use. 
**Note:** //Can we get some of those anomalous Bob Ross tapes? I think those would go really well with these paints. - Researcher █████ ███████//

||~ Attempt at containment: ||~ Observed new properties: ||
|| Agent Acer bought a birdhouse as a present for his son, as he has an interest in avian biology and migration patterns. He place it in his personal car and attempted to drive it home || The object began to emit a low-energy electromagnetic field that disabled the vehicle&#39;s alternator. Once he realized that the item was the source of this malfunction and the car operated normally when it was removed, he classified it as an anomaly and carried it to a Foundation regional platform for basic testing. ||
|| The platform&#39;s containment specialists placed the object into a box with a pad-lock and ensured that it stayed fifteen meters from all sensitive equipment. || The field emitted by the object increased in size and severity until it began hindering site operations. ||
|| Under the assumption that the anomaly simply expanded over time, it scheduled to be brought off-site in a barren field with no electronics. || The object physically increased in weight to the point where it could not be moved with on-site machinery. The exact new weight was not measured, but theorized to be over .5 tons. Notably at this point it stopped influencing electronics, causing staff to reconsider its properties.|| 
|| Dr. Fredricks from Site-23 was called and informed of the situation. He determined that the object was altering itself to evade containment by the Foundation, and suggested giving it to another group capable of containment. || The item returned to normal weight at some point during the conversation, and logistic staff begin preparing to transport the object to a local access point of the Wander&#39;s Library[[footnote]] A division of beings from the library notably //not// loyal to the Serpent&#39;s Hand. [[/footnote]]. However, mid-transport it began to telepathically transmit a view from out its circular opening to the assigned agents. As this would constitute a security breach for the library, it was not accepted into their establishment. ||
|| The birdhouse was physically placed in a soundproofed chamber which itself was placed in a larger, more powerful soundproofed chamber so that the object would gain a new hazard that only bypassed the first chamber. || The object was successfully place within the first chamber and started emitting sounds of bird songs with the cognitohazardous properties, causing staff to forget the code to lock the larger chamber, leaving it locked and unable to be closed. ||
|| Once again, Dr. Fredricks was contacted via the phone and became agitated, explaining that this anomaly was wasting his time and all containment measures were simply making it more dangerous. He unofficially suggested that it would &#34;probably be better to let the little shit go at this point.&#34; || The object&#39;s wood fused with the inner containment locker, all attempts to bring it out of containment have since failed. It is theorized that Dr. Fredricks accidentally made the current containment procedures intentionally not containing the item, thus making its ongoing containment a breach. ||

//Note: It has been suggested that the object&#39;s containment be modified in such a way that it is manipulated to gain new properties which would benefit the Foundation, however, other similar anomalies with actual SCP classifications would be better suited for this role and as such these suggestions are not being implemented at the time of writing.//

**Item Description:** A T-shirt, men&#39;s size medium, showing nothing more than a black symbol against a white background.  The symbol appears to be some form of glyph, but merely looking at the symbol causes pain.  This effect manifests as mild eyestrain after 10 seconds of exposure and escalates in severity, becoming a migraine after only 7 minutes.  The longest anyone has been able to view the symbol was 12 minutes and 40 seconds.  The viewer, a sufferer of cluster headaches, claimed that it was the worst pain she&#39;d ever experienced.  Other than the symbol, the item is non-anomalous.
**Date of Recovery:** 3-6-2021
**Location of Recovery:** Found at a garage sale in Minneapolis, MN, under a pile of clothing, none of which has been found to be anomalous.
