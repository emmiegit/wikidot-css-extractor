//It was an unholy din that surrounded the pair, people shouting and clamoring. There was a fifteen minute window when Site19 could have the yearly photo made, and currently, Dr. Glass was having a hard time getting people to listen, much less position themselves.//

//&#34;C&#39;mon, guys! Please! This shouldn&#39;t take long if you&#39;ll all just get into your places.&#34;//

//Lament found himself smiling. Waving at some friends as he worked toward the left of the room, moving to stand behind Gears&#39; shoulder.//

//When he looked around, he saw Agatha, giving him a significant look. He looked back at her, tilting his head and shrugging, giving her one of those—&#39;hell do you WANT me to do&#39;—looks. She gave it to him again, and he sighed, tapping Gears&#39; shoulder.//

//&#34;Sir?&#34; he asked.//

//&#34;Yes, Agent,&#34; Gears replied without turning around.//

//&#34;Smile, sir.&#34;//

//&#34;And what purpose would that serve, Agent?&#34;//

//He took a breath.//

//&#34;Smiling would serve to put the others at ease, sir. As this is a social function for the entire site, your smiling could aid the others in the establishment of a more efficient and normalized workplace, something that I believe your own reports have called essential when dealing with the unnatural world in which we work.&#34;//

//It was obviously prepared. Rehearsed. Practiced.//

//Gears turned and looked at him. After a moment, the corners of his lips inclined in a corpse-like rictus that never touched his eyes.//

//&#34;Is this sufficient?&#34;//

//Lament found himself grinning now. Genuinely.//

//&#34;Yes, sir.&#34;//

//&#34;Everyone!&#34; shouted Glass. &#34;Say... Butterflies!&#34;//

//&#34;Butterfliiieeessss,&#34; said the chorus.//
