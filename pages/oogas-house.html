[[size 150%]] **Warning:** My activity on the site varies, and I may be AWOL for extended periods. Feel free to yell at me because of this.[[/size]]

**General Info:**
I have eaten a cubic foot of chicken parmesan in under 10 minutes. My Dad is the ultimate being. I have the same birthday as my two best friends. I have a weird fixation on pineapple. Popeye is the strongest anime character of all time. I am fated to die in an IHOP. I listen to a lot of classic rock and hair metal, I can recommend songs if you want. I love you. If you start talking to me about D&amp;D, buckle in because we&#39;ll be here a while. I own a Muppet version of myself.

As a rule of thumb, expect whatever I make to be weird. Sometimes for comedic effect, sometimes to scare, it&#39;ll always be bizarre if it&#39;s coming from me. My articles are rarely all-the-way serious, but aside from the occasional grim piece expect at least one joke per article. I like to think I&#39;m good at interesting monster design, but I still haven&#39;t really written many creature features.

I am open to collabs, as they are fun, and it is cool to see other people&#39;s takes on your ideas.

If you need me, leave a pm on wikidot.

If you dislike any of my works, let me know why, so I can make them un-suck. I love getting feedback, and I read all comments in the discussions of my articles.

**Things Written (Oldest To Newest):**

[[[SCP-3386]]]
It&#39;s about owls. Co-authored with [[*user Zyn]].

[[[SCP-3446]]]
Magic rubber pants that take you to the mud world.

[[[SCP-3646]]]
Mosquitoes suck. Even when they&#39;re dead.

[[[SCP-3516]]]
Magic Bicycle Of Pain. One of my funnier articles.

[[[SCP-3836]]]
GOTTA GO FAST. My personal favorite, where I show my skill at crafting quirky characters.

My first ever tale, written about everybody&#39;s favorite Garfield skip. [http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/oogas-house/garf.jpeg Bonus art!]

[[[SCP-3586]]]
A dumb idea that [[*user notgull]](fittingly) and me came up with once. Was fun to write.

[[[SCP-4116]]]
Based off of real nightmares I had as a kid. I hope to expand upon it in the future, as it is another one of my favorites. [http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/oogas-house/kingus.jpg Also here&#39;s some art.] [http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/oogas-house/4116.jpg And some more, by the illustrious SunnyClockwork!]

[[[SCP-3596]]]
Power, Rangers, baby.

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/dk-class-donkey-kong-scenario DK-Class Donkey Kong Scenario]
You know when you have an idea, a //really bad// one, and no matter what you can&#39;t get it out of your mind until you do something with it? Yeah.

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/renaissance-of-fear Renassance Of Fear]
More Kingus, and my first full tale on the site. Hopefully, the first in a series of more to come.

[[[SCP-5266]]] 
My weirdest article, and that&#39;s sayin something. Be prepared for action sequences set to Village People songs.

[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/squawkblamthudbarf SquawkBLAMthudBarf]
A dialogue-only tale I wrote in a single sitting about SCP-3199.
