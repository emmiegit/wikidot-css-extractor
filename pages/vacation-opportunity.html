&gt; //Star transition to a pan shot of the beach. An adult male in a tuxedo walks in, but his head is not visible in the way that the camera is used. A link to [[[SCP-2030]]] has been hypothesized.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Narrator:** And don&#39;t take our word for it! Listen to these world-famous celebrities!
&gt; 
&gt; //Star transition to a room containing a red chair. [[[SCP-2337]]] is sitting in the chair. A bar at the bottom of the screen reads &#34;Dr. Spanko - Certified Stranglefruit Expert.&#34;//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2337:** Am Doktor Spankoflex, Cack! Unaffable housing and great Aunty Mekahlite and the end of the triply done trilogy. Clouds seemed to look like lollipops, Cack!
&gt; 
&gt; //Star transition to the same room. In SCP-2337&#39;s place, [[[SCP-1679|SCP-1679-1]]] is lying in the chair. The camera focuses on SCP-1679-1. Silence for ten seconds. The bar at the bottom reads &#34;Basil McMaster - Mayor of Belleview, [DATA REDACTED]&#34;//
&gt; 
&gt; //Star transition to the same room. [[[SCP-3477|Harold Holt]]] is now sitting in the chair. Biological Grafts allow it to be identified as SCP-3477-1. Bar reads &#34;Harold Holt - Prime Minister of Australia&#34;.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3477-1:** Hello there. I, Harold Holt, enjoyed Clocktree Beach. The ocean was quite the commotion, and the staff were the most friendly folk you&#39;ll ever meet.
&gt; 
&gt; //Star transition to the same room. SCP-3477-2 is now being interviewed. Bar reads &#34;Harold Holt - Prime Minister of Australia&#34;.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3477-2:** Hello there. I, Harold Holt, enjoyed Clocktree Beach. There were many unsuspecting guests I could make friends with, and the staff were the most friendly folk you&#39;ll ever meet.
&gt; 
&gt; //The remaining 75 instances of SCP-3477 feature in the commercial. Extraneous information removed.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Star transition to the family from earlier, still in the cage. Several SCP-2217-A instances are in the cage, removing parts of the family&#39;s bodies and replacing them with machine parts. Similarities to initiation rituals preformed by [[[church-of-the-broken-god-hub|GoI-004 (&#34;Church of the Broken God&#34;)]]] have been noted.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Narrator:** I can personally promise you that Clocktree Beach will be the best family vacation you&#39;ve ever had. Clocktree Beach: Come on down. Come on down to Clocktree Beach. Clocktree Beach is the ultimate resort to come on down to. Come on down. We&#39;ll all be waiting here. Come on down to Clocktree Beach. It&#39;s the only thing to do. Come on down and free us.
&gt; 
&gt; //Star transition to a black screen. The text &#34;COME ON DOWN&#34; has been printed on the screen. Commercial runs for three minutes and two seconds more. The family&#39;s screams are audible during this time.//
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;End Log&gt;//
