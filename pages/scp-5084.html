**Item #:** SCP-5084

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5084 is to be contained within a standard safe storage locker held at Site-19. All Foundation personnel with level 2 clearance or higher are permitted testing of SCP-5084 at the discretion of the site director.

**Description:** SCP-5084 is the collective sum of 40 cherry tomatoes (//Lycopersicon lycopersicum var. cerasiforme//) invulnerable to decomposition. SCP-5084&#39;s anomalous capabilities manifest when an individual is made aware of the presence of SCP-5084 in their immediate vicinity. The individual will firmly believe that all instances of SCP-5084 are sentient. Individuals have experienced auditory hallucinations in which they report hearing SCP-5084 produce human-like vocalizations. Individuals describe SCP-5084 instances as &#34;scared, nervous, and untrusting&#34; due to their vocalizations being described as childlike. SCP-5084&#39;s anomalous properties do not manifest when exposed to Foundation personnel.[[footnote]]Any individual who has been employed by the SCP Foundation for a period of more than one month[[/footnote]]

**Discovery:** SCP-5084 was discovered in a hotel located in Las Vegas, Nevada. SCP-5084 was housed in a terrarium residing in the entrance of the hotel. All guests were extremely protective of SCP-5084, physically berating any individuals who harmed SCP-5084 specimens. The Foundation was contacted when nearby businesses and local residents entered the hotel and were detained by local authorities. Foundation operatives observed attempts to plant SCP-5084 instances in an effort of preserving SCP-5084 through their offspring before acquiring SCP-5084.

&gt; **Subject(s):**  Five (5) instances of SCP-5084
&gt; **Foreword:** D-38291 is instructed to make eye contact with SCP-5084 and transcribe SCP-5084&#39;s statements. Afterward, D-38291 is to test effects of SCP-5084 consumption.
&gt; 
&gt; **Begin Log:**
&gt; 
&gt; (//D-38291 makes eye contact with SCP-5084//)
&gt; 
&gt; **D-38291:** What the hell? How the fuck are you ta-
&gt; 
&gt; **Test Overseer:** Just follow what we told you, 38291.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-38291:** Fine, hello th- what? I can barely hear you!
&gt; 
&gt; (//D-38291 arranges pile of SCP-5084 instances into a row//)
&gt; 
&gt; **D-38291:** Dear God, how long have you guys been piled like that? A couple of weeks! No wonder you&#39;re crying!
&gt; 
&gt; (//D-38291 leans in and speaks in a noticeably quieter tone//)
&gt; 
&gt; **D-38291:** Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not here to hurt you. I just need you to calm down. When were you first able to talk?
&gt; 
&gt; **Test Overseer:** Please transcribe their responses, 38291.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-38291:** They tell me that it&#39;s always been this way. They just don&#39;t know why the men in coats can&#39;t hear them. They&#39;re talking about you, aren&#39;t they?
&gt; 
&gt; **Test Overseer:** We told you 38291, they aren&#39;t sentient. This is all happening in your head, Foundation personnel just can&#39;t talk to them.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-38291:** I&#39;m Foundation personnel, aren&#39;t I?
&gt; 
&gt; (//Test Overseer pauses)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Test Overseer:** Just continue.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-38291:** What do you guys do all day?
&gt; 
&gt; (//D-38291 pauses for several seconds//)
&gt; 
&gt; **D-38291:** They&#39;ve just been rotting in a bin. They can&#39;t move, they can&#39;t talk, they can&#39;t even breathe. They&#39;re trapped.  Why can&#39;t you guys just let them out?
&gt; 
&gt; **Test Overseer:** That&#39;s outside of your control.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-38291:** Wait, I&#39;m not the first guy they&#39;ve tested these things on, aren&#39;t I? What have the men in coats done to you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Test Overseer:** It would be advisable to stick to the script before further action is needed.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-38291:** You&#39;ve... oh dear god. You&#39;ve sliced them, crushed them, diced them. What&#39;s next? Am I going to eat one of them or something?
&gt; 
&gt; **Test Overseer:** Actually, yes. You are to consume an SCP-5084 specimen.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-38291:** ...I&#39;m not going to do that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Test Overseer:** We&#39;ll give you one more chance 38291. Consume the specimen or suffer the consequences.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-38291:** I... I&#39;m sorry for what I&#39;m about to do.
&gt; 
&gt; (//D-38291 consumes SCP-5084 specimen//)
&gt; 
&gt; **D-38291:** It tastes... like a tomato. What did you expect? I can hear it fucking screaming down my throat. It&#39;s crying.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-38291:** You burnt them, blended them, and torn them apart. They&#39;re begging for mercy, no wonder they trust no one.
&gt; 
&gt; (//D-38291 escorted out of testing chamber//)
