I&#39;ve been sick for days now.  That bubbling nausea that fills your throat, makes you feel as if you&#39;re about to throw up every time you burp or so much as breathe out your mouth.  Holding the toilet, resting my head on the cool, cool porcelain, I really question why in the hell I don&#39;t make myself throw up and just get it over with.  It&#39;s just not something I can do...thinking of forcefully gagging myself...ugh, it&#39;s almost worse then I feel now.  Almost.

Suddenly it hits me, and this is it, this is IT.  I feel that slick, sour spit coat my throat, my belly tightening up as I push my head over the bowl and spit.  For a split second before I explode, I realize this thing has not been cleaned in a while.  Then I vomit.  Hard.  Mucus-rich and acidic, it pours out in a hard, jetting stream from my mouth and nose, burning my nasal passages like fire.  It hits so hard, it feels like it should be coming out my eyes, too.

I vomit again, and again, the third time bringing up just some thin, reeking slime, and I gasp a bit, getting my breath back before the next wave.  I pitch forward again, eyes tearing as they squeeze shut, and I feel another hot jet of filth pour out.  Opening my eyes, it seems...different.  A tarry black, and there are...things bobbing in it.  I don&#39;t have time to look too hard, before two more hard retches double me over the bowl.  These are more pinkish, and I can definitely see some kind of meat in these.  Hamburger, maybe...

More vomit, more oddness.  I don&#39;t remember eating any kind of jelly, especially cherry.  It&#39;s starting to hurt, a deep spike each time.  God, how much can a person throw up?  When did I eat noodles that long...or that big?  The goo in it is getting thicker too, and pink...starting to feel at least a little better.  Ugh...when did I eat a balloon?  My belly is feeling better now, really light.  Jesus...whatever that was is floating still...almost looks like it&#39;s pulsing, or beating...going to have to move to the sink, toilet&#39;s almost full.  Feeling better now...hungry, actually.  Very hungry.  Starving.  Ravenous.

I feel so empty.
