]]

**Item #:** SCP-577

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-577 is to be contained within a standard large containment unit, reinforced with steel ballistic shielding. All doors to the containment unit and related areas must be capable of remote operation. 

Twice a year, D-Class personnel are to be sent into the chamber to inspect the ballistic shielding for any damage caused by SCP-577 and make any needed repairs. They are also responsible for removing any cadavers or detritus left from prior entries into the containment chamber. Any Foundation personnel entering SCP-577&#39;s containment must wear full-body ballistic protection. 

**Description:** SCP-577 is an animated, levitating mass of ammunition of various calibers, that persistently spins in a spherical formation. Approximately 40% of the ammunition is 9mm; however, large quantities of 10mm and .45 ACP rounds have also been noted. Bullets within SCP-577 are capable of leaving the mass and firing at speeds comparable to those from a standard handgun. Occasionally, the mass has been observed forming recognizable shapes and likenesses, commonly those of domestic animals. SCP-577&#39;s total mass rises consistently, with approximately one thousand new pieces of ammunition appearing in the mass each year. 

SCP-577 is exceptionally aggressive towards all Foundation staff and D-Class who have a background in law enforcement. A large amount of its mass will fire towards these staff members, resulting in physical injury and occasionally death. However, research has found that SCP-577 acts friendly towards a small number of D-Class, typically those taken from the US prison and homeless populations.

**Addendum 577a:** On 01/██/2019, D-28126 was sent into SCP-577&#39;s containment chamber for its semi-annual inspection. The inspection, and resulting interview have been recorded below. 

&gt; **@@[00:00]:@@** D-28126 enters the containment chamber. SCP-577 approaches D-28126 and assumes the shape and size of a large cat. D-28126 looks confused. 
&gt; 
&gt; **@@[02:34]:@@** D-28126 begins the inspection and maintenance, but stops periodically to pet SCP-577.
&gt; 
&gt; **@@[04:01]:@@** D-28126&#39;s progress in washing the walls slows, and he appears to be crying.  
&gt; 
&gt; **@@[05:53]:@@** D-28126 stops working and slumps against the wall. SCP-577 sits next to him and rests its head on his leg. D-28126 continues crying and holds SCP-577 closely. 
&gt; 
&gt; **@@[08:19]:@@** Staff order D-28126 to leave the containment chamber. He does not immediately comply, and instead continues holding SCP-577. 
&gt; 
&gt; **@@[09:37]:@@** SCP-577 appears to guide D-28126&#39;s hand into itself. When he pulls his hand out, it is covered in what appears to be blood.
&gt; 
&gt; **@@[10:44]:@@** D-28126 stares at his hand for several moments before opening it to reveal a bullet that throbs slightly and drips blood. He holds his hand to his chest and whispers something.
&gt; 
&gt; **@@[15:52]:@@** After further exhortation from on-duty personnel, D-28126 stands up and embraces SCP-577 before exiting the containment chamber. 
 
Upon being brought out of the containment chamber, the bullet stopped moving and all other anomalous effects ceased. This allowed security personnel to detain D-28126 and confiscate the bullet for analysis and testing.

The blood was genetically similar to D-28126&#39;s but not identical. Ballistics analysis of the bullet indicates it had impacted flesh or some other soft substance, however D-28126 was not harmed in any way. 

The bullet was returned to the D-Class prior to the interview. 

&gt; **Dr. Vanderbilt:** First things first, please state your name for the record. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-28126:** I&#39;m Arturo Rosas... Uhhh D-Class two-eight-one-two-six
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Vanderbilt:** Wonderful. //(He notes something on his pad)// Alright, Arturo, I want you to walk me through what happened in there. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-28126:** It turned itself into my cat- A cat... that me and my brother helped as a kid. I&#39;d recognize his tail anywhere. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Vanderbilt:** You&#39;re positive it was your cat? 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-28126:** Yes. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Vanderbilt:** You obviously must really miss it for you to decide to just quit what you were doing. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-28126:** It&#39;s what he said to me. I... heard him talk to me. It was quiet. I almost didn&#39;t hear it, but he said &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Vanderbilt:** If this was really your cat, what would it have to be sorry about. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-28126:** It was him! I&#39;m not making this shit up!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Vanderbilt:** //(Raises a hand)// No need to get angry. I concede, this was your cat. Please, go on. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-28126:** Before I was with you guys. Just after my mom kicked me a-and my brother out. A cat found us. He was a stray, but we gave it a little bit of our food  and he stuck around. My brother named him Duck, &#39;cause he liked the sign when we were learning sign language together. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-28126:** //(He pauses)// He helped us survive, kind of trained him to be like a therapy cat, you know? My brother was deaf, and it&#39;s hard enough not having a home. Duck helped him a lot, until... //(D-28126 sighs and wipes his eyes)// The last time I saw Duck was... was when he came to find me, I don&#39;t know how. But he was always Ricardo&#39;s cat first. He led me back to where we were staying, cops all over the area. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-28126:** I never got to say goodbye. I was so angry and scared... Duck tried to comfort me, but I threw rocks at him. I didn&#39;t mean to; it&#39;s just a part of me h-hated Duck for showing me. He hissed at me and ran away. //(D-28126 coughs)// Saw on the news a few days later that &#34;an unnamed male had threatened a police officer&#34;. The cop was naturally afraid for his life and just shot. We were just two kids trying to survive. Of course the news doesn&#39;t bother to ask questions, instantly started to list stats about gang violence.  
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Vanderbilt:** That sounds rough. But I&#39;m not really sure how it&#39;s relevant.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-28126:** //(Shouting)// Because that thing gave me a chance to say goodbye! You&#39;ve probably forgotten what your family feels like, but this bullet was my brother&#39;s heart. I lived beside him for years. I know what his heartbeat feels like from the nights we spent trying to keep warm. Or the times he was afraid when a cop drove past, or when it jumped if I woke him. And for those few seconds where this bullet was still beating, I was able to say goodbye! I felt his blood drain onto my hands, and I was able to comfort him...
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Vanderbilt:** Well, I hope you&#39;re doing better now. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-28126:** I don&#39;t know if it was all in my head. But knowing all the weird stuff here, I feel- I know that Ricardo could sense I was there. Even now, ten years later.
