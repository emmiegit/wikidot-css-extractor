**Item #:** SCP-5475

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The area surrounding SCP-5475 is to be monitored by a minimum of two armed guards at all times. Any civilian attempting to access SCP-5475 is to be detained, interrogated and amnesticized following standard protocol for anomalous locations.

Tests conducted on SCP-5475 must be expressly authorized by the O5 Council. All subjects who enter SCP-5475 must wear an activated recording device at all times. Upon exiting SCP-5475, these recordings are to be analyzed, and subjects are to be amnesticized or terminated as deemed necessary.

By Agreement 5475/1-G, PoI-5475 will be allowed to live indefinitely in the house in the vicinity of SCP-5475, henceforth designated as Provisional Site 5475-01, in exchange for her cooperation.

**Description:** SCP-5475 is a cave located at the foot of a mountain in an undisclosed location in southern Ireland. SCP-5475 is about 1.5 kilometers deep, and has a height of approximately 3 meters. The width of SCP-5475 varies greatly along the route, so an average measurement could not be established.

The main anomaly of SCP-5475 consists of the generation of multiple vocalizations coming from an unidentified location inside the cave. These vocalizations will be focused on the first human to enter SCP-5475, and will consist of a male voice describing in detail all the &#34;secrets&#34; that are being kept from the subject. At the time of writing, secrets exposed by SCP-5475 have ranged from miscellaneous events from the subject&#39;s childhood and/or adolescence, to highly classified information regarding the internal structure of the Foundation.

The secondary anomaly of SCP-5475 consists of a grave located at the end of the cave, hereafter designated SCP-5475-A, which shows no signs of natural deterioration, and all damage inflicted on it will be regenerated once all subjects have exited SCP-5475. The tombstone of this grave is transcribed below.

**Discovery:** SCP-5475 was discovered on 15/01/2021, after Ms. Aisling Sullivan, now designated PoI-5475, attempted to commit suicide by jumping into one of the rivers near the locality. Fortunately, a police officer spotted her and was able to rescue her. In her statement, PoI-5475 described the relevant anomaly, which alerted an undercover agent from the Foundation and subsequently led to the classification of SCP-5475.

Shortly after these events, Dr. Kathleen Silverlock was assigned to interview PoI-5475 regarding the anomaly. A transcription of this interview can be found below.

&gt; **Interviewed:** PoI-5475
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Kathleen Silverlock
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** This interview took place 1 week after the discovery of SCP-5475, and was conducted at the residence of PoI-5475. This log was translated from Irish.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; //(Dr. Silverlock is sitting in PoI-5475&#39;s couch. The latter enters the room with two cups of coffee, and offers one to Dr. Silverlock before taking a seat.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Silverlock:** Thank you for allowing us to interview you, Mrs. Sullivan, it&#39;s of great help to us.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5475:** Oh, don&#39;t worry, I think it will do me some good... to talk about it too. And please call me Aisling.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Silverlock:** Of course, Aisling. //(Dr. Silverlock smiles.)// Well, we&#39;d better start with the questions. Let&#39;s see... //(Dr. Silverlock looks through her papers.)// When was the first time you knew about the voices in the cave?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5475:** Well... It&#39;s quite a long story. I think I should start at the beginning, even if it sounds a bit redundant. I hope I won&#39;t bore you //(PoI-5475 chuckles.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Silverlock:** Oh, don&#39;t worry, I think I have enough time. //(Dr. Silverlock takes a sip from her coffee.)// Well, you can start whenever you want.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5475:** Yeah, well, I... //(PoI-5475 sighs.)// It could be said that it all started when I was sixteen, you know, that time when we all did whatever we wanted and the world seemed infinite.... //(PoI-5475 remains silent for a few moments.)// I... met a guy. Yeah, I know it was like ten years ago, but I still... I get a little nervous when I remember it. //(PoI-5475 chuckles.)//
&gt; 
&gt; //(Dr. Silverlock smiles.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Silverlock:** Don&#39;t worry, I understand you.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5475:** Well... I met this guy, his name was Darren, although I think you should have guessed that by now. //(PoI-5475 smiles and takes a sip of coffee.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dra. Silverlock:** I figured.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5475:** Heh, yeah, he was one of the best looking guys in my class. All the girls wanted him for themselves and all that high school drama crap. //(PoI-5475 takes another sip of coffee.)// But... he and I... we had many things in common. Our musical tastes, the movies we watched, our ideologies... We had some friends in common, so we started spending time together and... I guess things just fell into place. //(PoI-5475 chuckles.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Silverlock:** I understand. You fell in love with him, didn&#39;t you?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5475:** Yeah... and he also fell in love with me. I still remember that day, when he told me. We had gone to an ice skating rink near the school. Jesus, when I remember it... //(PoI-5475 pauses briefly.)// By the time we left it was already dark, and we started to walk around for a while... //(PoI-5475 shakes her head.)// I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t mean to go on so long, but I tend to get too deep into detail, and when I remember Darren....
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Silverlock:** It&#39;s okay, don&#39;t worry, I understand what you must be going through. Please continue.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5475:** Right. //(PoI-5475 sighs.)// We started dating. He was passionate about photography, so for most of our dates we used to go to places that looked like something out of a painting. Some forests, flower plains... those kinds of places. Well, so... //(PoI-5475 abrubtly stops. Dr. Silverlock looks concerned.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Silverlock:** Is there... anything you&#39;re having trouble saying?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5475:** Y-yes... It&#39;s just... //(PoI-5475 looks nervous. She takes another sip of coffee; her hands are visibly shaking.)// Once we decided to go to a forest nearby. The trip was a bit expensive, but Darren was very excited. He spent the whole trip talking about the pictures he was going to take... and the ones we would take together- //(PoI-5475 stops; looks as if she is about to cry.)//
&gt; 
&gt; //(Dr. Silverlock leans towards PoI-5475 and starts talking in a reassuring voice.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Silverlock:** Don&#39;t worry, you can tell me what happened. 
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5475:** We... wandered away from the route we had planned and... found the cave. At first I was a little scared that a bear or something lived there, but Darren insisted on going in. He looked so excited... so we went in and... //(PdI-5475 looks disstressed.)// And...
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Silverlock:** If I may ask, approximately how long did it take from the time you entered until you heard the voice?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5475:** Yeah, sure, I... I think it was ten minutes or so. Darren got to take several pictures before... first we heard it coming from inside the cave. It was like a constant whisper around us. First it said to us &#34;Your dog didn&#39;t run away, your dad ran him over.&#34; I was scared, but Darren looked more confused than scared. And then... then we heard the voice again, although this time it was closer to Darren. It told us &#34;Your best friend is making fun of you behind your back,&#34; and then... then....
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Silverlock:** Yeah?
&gt; 
&gt; //(PoI-5475 lowers her head.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5475:** Then the voice told him that I was secretly in another relationship.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Silverlock:** ...
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5475:** I... we had a fight and broke up. A few months later I found out he had committed suicide and in his letter he blamed me among other people. I knew he was sensitive, but I never thought...
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Silverlock:** How was it that they decided to bury him in the cave?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5475:** He was not buried there. His relatives took him to a cemetery near their home. I found the grave when I wanted to see where those voices had come from. I know they would never want me living near his real grave, so I gathered some money and came to live here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Silverlock:** I see... 
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5475:** I- //(PoI-5475 is crying at this point.)// It wasn&#39;t my intention, I was about to break up with my other boyfriend, but things got complicated and.... the only thing I want is to have him close to me, I want... I want him to know that I&#39;m sorry, that I still love him, and that I need him to forgive me. //(PoI-5475 covers her eyes with her hands and starts trembling.)//
&gt; 
&gt; //(Dr. Silverlock sits in silence for a few moments before trying to continue with the interview.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Silverlock:** So... About how long did it take after you found the grave before you realized about its anomalous properties?
&gt; 
&gt; //(PoI-5475 looks at Dr. Silverlock. Her eyes are still covered in tears.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5475:** Its &#34;anomalous properties&#34;? What do you mean?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Silverlock:** The grave&#39;s anomalous properties, of course. You are aware that the tombstone cannot be destroyed, right?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5475:** What...? I didn&#39;t... I didn&#39;t know that. You mean...?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Silverlock:** Our teams have examined the grave, and any damage done to it is repaired once they leave the cave.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5475:** ... No, I didn&#39;t know that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Silverlock:** Oh, it&#39;s okay.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Dr. Silverlock looks through her papers one more time and starts mumbling to herself. PoI-5475 looks at Dr. Silverlock and then at her cup of coffee; she sighs before talking again.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5475:** I think I know why that happens.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Silverlock:** Sorry?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5475:** I think I know why the grave can&#39;t be damaged. It&#39;s a... little theory I started making a few months ago. I started to wonder why the voice does what it does and I... I drew my conclusions.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Silverlock:** Well, go ahead.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5475:** The voice... I don&#39;t think it enjoys revealing secrets. What&#39;s more, I don&#39;t think he enjoys doing what he does.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Silverlock:** What do you mean exactly?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5475:** Think about it, a secret is capable of... destroying everything. A secret can break families, end friendships, provoke murders, cause wars...
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Silverlock:** Please be a little more specific.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5475:** What I&#39;m getting at is that... I think the voice doesn&#39;t like us keeping secrets. And I think it reproaches us by telling us everything that they keep hidden from us. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Silverlock:** ...
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5475:** And... the cave, or whatever it&#39;s inside... it looks after Darren&#39;s grave because it wants us to remember him, to remember that....
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Silverlock:** It wants us to remember the consequences of keeping secrets.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5475:** Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Both Dr. Silverlock and PoI-5475 remain in silence for aproximatly 30 seconds.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Silverlock:** That... is an interesting theory. A //very// interesting theory. So, ahmm, is there anything else you would like to tell us, Aisling?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5475:** No, I don&#39;t think so. But... I&#39;ve seen that you guys are very interested in the cave and from afar it looks like you&#39;re a secret organization and all that stuff. //(PoI-5475 chuckles.)// ... You&#39;re from the government, aren&#39;t you?
&gt; 
&gt; //(Dr. Silverlock hesitates before answering.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Silverlock:** Yes, we are from the government.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5475:** Yeah, it&#39;s just that... Would you allow me to continue living here? I - I don&#39;t want to have to go somewhere else. I want to stay by his side, you know what I mean? I want to... remember him forever. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Silverlock:** ... I&#39;ll see what I can do, Aisling.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5475:** ... Thank you.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;END LOG&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Following this interview, the Ethics Committee stated that keeping PoI-5475 near SCP-5475 could be helpful in maintaining a reliable cover story between the locals, thus establishing Agreement 5475/1-G, and allowing her to remain living at Provisional Site 5475-01 in exchange for her cooperation.
