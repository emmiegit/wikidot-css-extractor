&gt; **[Begin Log]**
&gt; 
&gt; **Ashcombe:** All right, let&#39;s get this fucking thing over with. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dalton:** The old man&#39;s right. I can&#39;t take much more of this. But before you all vote for me, I just want to say—
&gt; 
&gt; **Simmons:** We&#39;re not voting for you, moron. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dalton:** What? Really? Nobody?
&gt; 
&gt; **Ashcombe:** Fuck you! I&#39;m voting for him!
&gt; 
&gt; **Long:** I&#39;m not. I&#39;m voting for Jeannie.
&gt; 
&gt; **Kirkwood:** Love you too, Shells.
&gt; 
&gt; **Simmons:** People, please. Nobody&#39;s voting for anyone yet. I have something to say. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** You usually do, yeah.
&gt; 
&gt; **Simmons:** We&#39;ve tried a lot of things. We&#39;ve tried ending the vote in a tie. We&#39;ve tried not voting at all. But in forty-five years, there&#39;s still something we haven&#39;t tried. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s part of the magic or if we&#39;re all just stupid— 
&gt; 
&gt; **Ashcombe:** If you&#39;ve got a plan, give it to us sometime //today//, please. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Simmons:** Ricks. We need to vote for Dr. Ricks. 
&gt; 
&gt; [11 seconds silence]
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** Jesus christ.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ashcombe:** Sure. Worth a shot.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dalton:** Wait. Wait. I don&#39;t understand.
&gt; 
&gt; **Simmons:** Think about it. We&#39;ve suspected for years that the game was rigged. 
&gt; 
&gt; //Dr. Ricks, observing the proceedings from the nearby, becomes visibly agitated.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Research Assistant Baxter:** (//To Dr. Ricks//) Should we intervene?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ricks:** Let&#39;s wait a moment.
&gt; 
&gt; **Simmons:** This whole thing is an obvious act of sadism. Something is toying with us. Naturally, then, it would want to watch us. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dalton:** Dr. Ricks has only been around for, what? Eight years?
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** We&#39;ve had other presiding researchers before him. Dr. Olsen, Dr. Smith, Dr. Shipley—
&gt; 
&gt; **Long:** It could all be the same person! It&#39;s changing its shape!
&gt; 
&gt; **Simmons:** Exactly. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Kirkwood:** Son of a bitch.
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** Wait, I thought you said you knew?
&gt; 
&gt; **Kirkwood:** I lied.
&gt; 
&gt; **Simmons:** So it&#39;s settled: we&#39;re voting for Ricks. Any objections?
&gt; 
&gt; //Other subjects express agreement.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ricks:** I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m afraid that involving any person other than SCP-3306 persons of interest would be considered a breach of containment. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Kirkwood:** Go to hell!
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** I can&#39;t believe we trusted you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ricks:** (//To Research Assistant Baxter//) Issue a lockdown.
&gt; 
&gt; //Baxter does not respond.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ricks:** Put us on lockdown, damn it!
&gt; 
&gt; **Research Assistant Baxter:** I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t... When did you start working here? I&#39;m trying to remember, and I—
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ricks:** Keep your head. It&#39;s memetic! It&#39;s affecting your mind! Just issue the lockdown and we can discuss this later.
&gt; 
&gt; **Research Assistant Baxter:** Why don&#39;t //you// issue it, sir? You have clearance, don&#39;t you? 
&gt; 
&gt; //Dr. Ricks violently grabs Baxter by the throat.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ricks:** I am a Foundation scientist! I was always a scientist! I didn&#39;t want any of this! You think I //liked this?// Fuck you, you don&#39;t even—
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-3306 abruptly stops turning, causing 3306-POI subjects fall over.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3306:** (//Prerecorded message//) Congratulations, you win! We hope you enjoyed the game. Play again soon!
&gt; 
&gt; //Dr. Ricks releases Research Assistant Baxter, who quickly flees. The lights on SCP-3306 go dark. Dr. Ricks collapses.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ricks:** I see. Thank you for your time.
&gt; 
&gt; **[End Log]**

**Afterword:** Following this event, SCP-3306 ceased all anomalous activity and 3306-POI subjects were placed under quarantine. Subsequent autopsy of Dr. Rick&#39;s body shows that he suffered a fatal heart attack at the time SCP-3306 deactivated. No other anomalous features of the body were observed, and investigators have yet to confirm any abnormalities in Dr. Rick&#39;s history with the Foundation. 3306-POI subjects appear to have regained normal biological functions. 

By order of Site Director Goode, if no other anomalous phenomena are observed within a period of 370 days, SCP-3306 is to be reclassified as Neutralized and its documentation rewritten. Once neutralization is confirmed, 3306-POI are to be administered amnestics, assigned new identities, and reintegrated into society.
