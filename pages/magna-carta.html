[[[SCP-3531]]] - Skyfood

[[collapsible show=&#34;probably will be my best title&#34; hide=&#34;that does not bode well for my future titles&#34;]]
this article came to me after looking through my window right after my plane took off and seeing that the plane&#39;s shadow looked kind of like a swordfish. from then i just came up with more sea related imagery on a plane. this is a strange thing for me to have written, something primarily imagery-based, and i don&#39;t think i&#39;ll write a lot more like this in the future. but who knows?

[[[SCP-4543]]] - Dead Men Sell No Sales

[[collapsible show=&#34;zombies&#34; hide=&#34;sharply dressed charismatic zombies&#34;]]
i came up with this idea off of the incredibly dumb title, and then also based off of an SCP inspired storyline i was working on about an AI named Seraph that did fleshcrafting and a whole bunch of lovecraftian what have you. obviously very little of that went into this, but i think that would explain where all the weird shit in this thing comes from. body horror, funnily enough, is also not something that i would say is generally in my area of expertise, but i&#39;m quite proud of this one.

[[[SCP-4232]]] - Thought Crustacean

[[collapsible show=&#34;you like art? you like lobsters?&#34; hide=&#34;i know i do&#34;]]
i honestly don&#39;t know where i got this idea. originally this was going to be way more technical and science-fictiony and full of jargon, with a bunch of noosphere stuff, but then at some point i got really frustrated with myself and the SCP wiki and i decided to take it out on this poor little draft. now that i think about it, taking random things and colliding them seems to be a pretty big part of my writing process.

[[[the-five-mind |Carroll #155]]] - The Five-Mind

[[collapsible show=&#34;like nerves, glowing black and white,&#34; hide=&#34;blue and pink, a colourless shade of green&#34;]]
you can thank [[*user Rounderhouse]] for the inspiration of this one. this draft started when he was incredibly bent on the chicago spirit. at the time, i myself was way into fifthism (still am) and we would occasionally banter about which was the better GoI. after a while, i proposed this GoI format to him, to which he replied &#34;a union for the ages&#34; and so i started on it the next day. appropriately enough, a long ass period of me not working on it meant i released it 5 months after i started working on it. this is yet another example of me shoving two things together and making it work.

[[[Crushing Your Dreams]]] - Oneiroi Format

[[collapsible show=&#34;i swear half the reason this format exists is to fit in as many easter eggs as possible&#34; hide=&#34;i should have added more&#34;]]
this was originally my collab con entry with [[*user Gekkoguy]], but we came to the conclusion that neither of our entries were particularly collaborative. i wrote most of it over the course of 2 days, and barely had any time to implement feedback, so this is //almost// a coldpost. had it not been for the GOC tweets and the early on complaints of &#34;corporeal organizations&#34; then this would be a coldpost. regardless, this was written as a comedic exercise in how the internet reacts to the apocalypse, driven by a plot about fifthism and corp/pure tension.

[[[SCP-5633]]] - __This Will Require A Great Amount of Blood__

[[collapsible show=&#34;dream logic&#34; hide=&#34;nightmare logic&#34;]]
this is a true exquisite corpse SCP, and it shows. the entire thing, at least to me, works surprisingly well together in spite of that fact (although that seems to be a very contentious opinion). if you look in the source code, you can see who did each section. with mine, i knew that the rest of the article was going to be completely off the rails, so i used my sections for some regular old-fashioned medical horror, as a breather between sections. i think this approach kind of worked.
