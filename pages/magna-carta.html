my stuff:

[[[SCP-3531]]] - Skyfood

[[collapsible show=&#34;probably will be my best title&#34; hide=&#34;that does not bode well for my future titles&#34;]]
this article came to me after looking through my window right after my plane took off and seeing that the plane&#39;s shadow looked kind of like a swordfish. from then i just came up with more sea related imagery on a plane. this is a strange thing for me to have written, something primarily imagery-based, and i don&#39;t think i&#39;ll write a lot more like this in the future. but who knows? 

[[/collapsible]]

[[[SCP-4543]]] - Dead Men Sell No Sales

[[collapsible show=&#34;zombies&#34; hide=&#34;sharply dressed charismatic zombies&#34;]]
i came up with this idea off of the incredibly dumb title, and then also based off of an SCP inspired storyline i was working on about an AI named Seraph that did fleshcrafting and a whole bunch of lovecraftian what have you. obviously very little of that went into this, but i think that would explain where all the weird shit in this thing comes from. body horror, funnily enough, is also not something that i would say is generally in my area of expertise, but i&#39;m quite proud of this one.
[[/collapsible]]

[[[SCP-4232]]] - Thought Crustacean

[[collapsible show=&#34;you like art? you like lobsters?&#34; hide=&#34;i know i do&#34;]]
i honestly don&#39;t know where i got this idea. originally this was going to be way more technical and science-fictiony and full of jargon, with a bunch of noosphere stuff, but then at some point i got really frustrated with myself and the SCP wiki and i decided to take it out on this poor little draft. now that i think about it, taking random things and colliding them seems to be a pretty big part of my writing process.
[[/collapsible]]

[[[the-five-mind |Carroll #155]]] - The Five-Mind

[[collapsible show=&#34;like nerves, glowing black and white,&#34; hide=&#34;blue and pink, a colourless shade of green&#34;]]
you can thank [[*user Rounderhouse]] for the inspiration of this one. this draft started when he was incredibly bent on the chicago spirit. at the time, i myself was way into fifthism (still am) and we would occasionally banter about which was the better GoI. after a while, i proposed this GoI format to him, to which he replied &#34;a union for the ages&#34; and so i started on it the next day. appropriately enough, a long ass period of me not working on it meant i released it 5 months after i started working on it. this is yet another example of me shoving two things together and making it work.

[[/collapsible]]

[[[Crushing Your Dreams]]] - Oneiroi Format

[[collapsible show=&#34;i swear half the reason this format exists is to fit in as many easter eggs as possible&#34; hide=&#34;i should have added more&#34;]]
this was originally my collab con entry with [[*user Gekkoguy]], but we came to the conclusion that neither of our entries were particularly collaborative. i wrote most of it over the course of 2 days, and barely had any time to implement feedback, so this is //almost// a coldpost. had it not been for the GOC tweets and the early on complaints of &#34;corporeal organizations&#34; then this would be a coldpost. regardless, this was written as a comedic exercise in how the internet reacts to the apocalypse, driven by a plot about fifthism and corp/pure tension.

[[[SCP-5633]]] - __This Will Require A Great Amount of Blood__

[[collapsible show=&#34;dream logic&#34; hide=&#34;nightmare logic&#34;]]
this is a true exquisite corpse SCP, and it shows. the entire thing, at least to me, works surprisingly well together in spite of that fact (although that seems to be a very contentious opinion). if you look in the source code, you can see who did each section. with mine, i knew that the rest of the article was going to be completely off the rails, so i used my sections for some regular old-fashioned medical horror, as a breather between sections. i think this approach kind of worked.
[[/collapsible]]

[[[SCP-6515]]] - Chancellor of the Excheddar

[[collapsible show=&#34;cheesy political commentary&#34; hide=&#34;hope it doesn&#39;t expire soon&#34;]]
i was informed shortly after posting this that i had posted my article one hour before the posting deadline for a major contest. which is unfortunate, but i&#39;m not bothered enough to pull it and repost it, so i suppose that&#39;s how it&#39;s going to be.

i&#39;m very happy with this article. it&#39;s my longest so far, and i think it&#39;s my best work with the SCP format. it&#39;s also the first thing i&#39;ve posted in over 2 years, so that&#39;s pretty exciting. the concept started with me joking around with my friends about that one boris johnson police beanie photo, and how he almost looked like a cardboard cutout, and then we came up with more horrifying british political anomalies, and my friend said &#34;this is some SCP shit,&#34; and i took it as a challenge. which i have now beaten months later.

other stuff:

[[[Last One]]] by [[*user DarkStuff]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;last one, last one&#34; hide=&#34;ok those two were false starts but THIS is the last one&#34;]]
an action-packed banger of tale from DarkStuff featuring a fucked-up guy on a quest to save people from SCP-3531. if you&#39;d asked me when i wrote it, i would&#39;ve told you there&#39;s no way an action scene within SCP-3531 to save everyone on board would make sense, it&#39;s too eldritch and incomprehensible for that; well joke&#39;s on me, because the action on display is equally eldritch and incomprehensible. it&#39;s also surprisingly heartwarming, in a way. this was a gift for the 2019 Art Exchange and i was (and am) incredibly grateful.

[[[July 27th, 1998 Quarry Park, Calgary, Alberta]]] by [[*user toadking07]] 

[[collapsible show=&#34;good old greg&#34; hide=&#34;good old, old, old greg&#34;]]
a light-hearted comedic take on the events of SCP-4543. i feel like SCP-4543 really is more of a comedy than a horror, in a sense that this tale illustrates really well; all in all it&#39;s a bunch of dead people selling dead animals to an unjustifiably enraptured customer base. inherently goofy. for the sake of appearances, the people in SCP-4543 give random, differing, plausible explanations for why they buy the things they buy, but this tale takes the opportunity to explore the obviously anomalous fervor with which people will buy shitty taxidermies in the neighborhood of Quarry Park. this was another gift for the 2019 Art Exchange, presumably because i was so nice that year. very glad to have gotten this tale as well.
