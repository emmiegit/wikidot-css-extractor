I, Zara (she/them) try to do a whole lot of nothing around here whilst still doing a whole lot of something. 

However, I am a  [https://medium.com/@leilamariebloom/end-of-life-plans-154c849b8a9b prize-winning writer], [https://i.imgur.com/qmvguyt.jpg photographer] and [https://imgur.com/a/ID5izId artist] who is happy to devote as much time as I can helping people with their drafts and artistic expression. 

When not critiquing or generally being awesome, I write. Here are some things I wrote.

The Kit series is well over 10 Tales long at the time of writing. Rather than listing them all here, I advise you to click the above link to go to Kit&#39;s Hub.

* I have a cat. She is 9. She has a pun name, Purrcilla, like the Australian drag queen bus but in cat form. She is a 6kg calico who threatens to crush me often if I don&#39;t feed her on time.
* I have a decreasing number of gerbils, but it&#39;s still a hoard. I have Tit, Pensri, Bodhi, Fawn and Fable. 
* I now have 16 tattoos and I also have 16 piercings because I like to keep things equal. 
* I vape all day, every day. I agree I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s going to do with my body.
* &#39;Choose Life&#39; is a dying mantra. 
* &#39;Trainspotting&#39; is my favourite film and the hardest-to-read book. It is followed closely by &#39;Mad Max: Fury Road&#39; because who couldn&#39;t love that piece of art? 
* Writing and critiquing is my --replacement-- --second-- --third-- --fourth-- fifth addiction so I don&#39;t think about my actual addictions so much. So I&#39;m here a lot, and **I&#39;m trying**.
