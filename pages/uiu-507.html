++++ On Limiting Risks
[[/=]]
The public is to be warned that UIU-507 is to be considered armed and extremely dangerous, and that sightings should be reported to their local sheriff post-haste.

--Sightings of UIU-507&#39;s capabilities are to be dismissed as the words of drunkards or the effects of mass hysteria.--

++++ The Oddity
[[/=]]
UIU-507 is an emancipated, 30 years young black male by the name of Tobias Yelez. His place of birth and birth-name are unknown, due to the abhorrently inconsistent, or perhaps even non-existent, paperwork done by his former slaver, one Colonel Christopher Mayford. UIU-507 is of a tall, stocky build, with the only notable physical oddity being the blonde, curled hair atop his head.

UIU-507 is capable of disappearing from where he is currently at, and reappearing at a further point than where he started. It is not known whether UIU-507 is able to control this ability of his, or whether he had any limits to the range he can &#34;teleport&#34; to and from.

UIU-507 also has a proficiency with firearms, and he appears to favor a nine-round LeMat Revolver on their person. It is unknown how he became so proficient, as it is next-to-impossible that Colonel Mayford allowed his slaves to be near his arms.

UIU-507 came to the Union Investigation Unit&#39;s attention following the report of the death of Colonel Mayford in Corbin, Kentucky on January 1st, 1873. His sharecrop&#39;s maid, one Dahlia Deeds, sent a telegram to the nearest law enforcement office, reporting that she&#39;d heard a gunshot inside of the Colonel&#39;s office. As the door was locked from the inside, she was unable to enter the chambers herself. Sheriff Evan Stevens and a small force of officers dispatched themselves to the sharecrop the following morning.

Initially it was believed that Colonel Mayford&#39;s death was a suicide. There were no signs of a struggle or forced entry from the door; a pistol was found clutched within his left hand; and the bullet extracted from his temple matched the caliber of the pistol.

However, after a summary was telegraphed to the Union Investigations Unit, concerns were enough for our organization to take over the remaining investigation. As a result, numerous inconsistencies were found that made the determination of suicide flawed.

Our findings were:
* Primary and secondary written accounts confirming that Christopher Mayford was right-handed.
* A set of bare footprints against the office&#39;s wooden floor, which spontaneously appeared and then led out to the balcony before vanishing.
* Eyewitness reports, from nearby sharecroppers, that a &#34;blonde black man&#34; was seen jumping off of Mayford&#39;s balcony, a revolver in his right hand, before disappearing into the nearby forest.

Upon taking these facts into account, the circumstances of death were upgraded to first-degree murder, and a file for Tobias Yelez, who matched the brief descriptions given by eyewitnesses, was opened under UIU-507.

UIU-507 seems to have acquired a reputation amongst the black population and the more sympathetic townsfolk he encountered in his travels. The public has dubbed him &#34;the Vanishing Vigilante&#34;, making our efforts in suppressing information about UIU-507 much more difficult.

As of this writing, UIU-507 has gunned down an estimated 15 former plantation owners, 20 sharecroppers, and 35 ex-Confederates in cold blood, and 19 bounty hunters in self-defense.

A sighting of UIU-507 was reported by one Jeremiah Cimmerian, formerly of //The Baltimore Star//, in the saloon of New Toronto, Wisconsin[[footnote]]Mr. Cimmerian was there as a private citizen.[[/footnote]]. However, complicating members was that UIU-507 was accompanied by and conversing amicably with a man of an almost identical appearance, only with a white complexion and dressed in &#34;robes that resembled an Oriental monk&#39;s garb&#34;.

Serendipitously, Mr. Cimmerian was able to transcribe a good deal of their conversation before the two left. The transcription, verbatim from the pen and paper Mr. Cimmerian wrote it with, is reproduced below.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Yelez:** You know, you&#39;re the first white man in a good while who hasn&#39;t pointed a barrel in my direction.

**Unknown Man:** //(laughter)// Well, even if I did bring a weapon with me, I couldn&#39;t ever bring myself to aim it at another one of my selves.

**Yelez:** //(leaning foward)// So you weren&#39;t bullshittin&#39; me, then? There&#39;s others like us, that bear this...curse?

**Unknown Man:** There are, all across &#34;Egg-drizzle&#34;{{[sic]}}, although before you, I&#39;ve never met one of them in person.

**Yelez:** //(dryly)// An&#39; do I make a good first impression?

**Unknown Man:** //(hesitantly)// Your cause is noble, if driven by brutal vengeance. Nevertheless, I shed no tears knowing that monsters like Mayford are put down, like the rabid dogs they are.

**Yelez:** You have a history with that fat fuck?

**Unknown Man:** //(a bitter undertone creeps into his voice, his knuckles turning white)// In a sense...

**Yelez:** Easy there. Let me change the subject. Can you tell me about some of the places you&#39;ve...gone?

**Unknown Man:** //(A wry smile cracks his lips)// Only if you tell me some of yours.

**Yelez:** //(chuckles)// Of course. Guest goes first, though.

//(A silence overtakes their table, a thoughtful frown curving downward on the Unknown Man&#39;s face)//

**Unknown Man:** I&#39;ve seen...worlds where birds have supremacy because of a vengeful god&#39;s actions. Where the Sun and moon themselves turn man, woman, and animal alike into monsters. Where mankind has gone to the stars, because the Earth is no longer a safe place to live.

**Yelez:** The stars, huh? I always did like watchin&#39; them, when those bastards on the plantation weren&#39;t breathin&#39; down my neck.

//(Another pregnant pause)//

**Yelez:** I&#39;ve been to worlds where no one can die, no matter what they try an&#39; do. Where the world is full of smoke an&#39; metal birds make a constant racket in the sky. Where...

//(Yelez takes a breath)//

**Yelez:** Where Lincoln never signed that paper, an&#39; my people were still treated as lesser than the dirt on the ground.

//(Yelez clenches his own fist against the table)//

**Yelez:** //(in a low voice)// I made sure to slaughter as many of those slaving bastards as I could, before I came back.

**Unknown Man:** ...Are you not worried, that one day your luck will run out?

**Yelez:** //(snorts)// I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be happenin&#39; any time soon. I faced off against Ace Cliff himself, you know, the day before I met you. We fought to a draw. Fate&#39;s smilin&#39; on me, keeping those UIU folk and these cops from nabbin&#39; me in my sleep.

**Unknown Man:** She can&#39;t smile on you forever, though. The scale has to tip the other way some day. It could be a bounty hunter with a faster draw than you. It could be you tripping during a chase with investigators. It could be someone murdering you in your sleep, or shooting you in the back when you least expect it.

//(Yelez does not respond for a few minutes. The Unknown Man patiently sips his drink and looking at them, as if waiting. Finally, Yelez&#39;s body sags, a tired sigh leaving him.)//

**Yelez:** ...Yes, I know. I&#39;ve considered crossin&#39; the Mexican border a few times, hangin&#39; up my guns an&#39; retirin&#39; to as peaceful of a life as I can. But there&#39;s no telling who, or what, might try to follow me down there. An&#39; the UIU would probably put me in front of a noose, for all the people I&#39;ve killed. I don&#39;t even want to think about what the Confederate Inspectors would do if they got their hands on me...

//(The Unknown places his hands on top of Yelez&#39;s)//

**Unknown Man:** There is another option. You could come with me, before I leave this place. The &#34;Serpent Sand&#34;{{[sic]}} are an eccentric bunch, but they&#39;re fundamentally good people. You would be safe there. You wouldn&#39;t have to fight, or worry, anymore.

//(Yelez is silent, taking a gulp of his drink, before returning his gaze to the Unknown Man. There is a sad look in his eyes as he shakes his head)//

**Yelez:** No. Thank you, but no. As dangerous and rough as this world still is, it&#39;s still my home. I can&#39;t just abandon it like that. //(smirks)// But...maybe I&#39;ll end up in this Library of yours by chance, and I&#39;ll say hello if you&#39;re around.

**Unknown Man:** I would like that, Tobias.

//(The two of them look in my direction)//[[footnote]]This sentence was noticeably written in a more sloppy matter than the rest of Mr. Cimmerian&#39;s prose.[[/footnote]]

**Yelez:** Come on. Let me pay, then let&#39;s get out of here.

**Unknown Man:** Yes, let&#39;s....
[[/div]]

The ramifications of this conversation, as well as the identity of this &#34;Unknown Man&#34;, still remain a mystery to us. Jeremiah Cimmerian was compensated to the tune of $1000 for their information, on the condition that it not be published in any papers.

On July 4th, 1876, UIU-507 approached the doors of the Union Investigations Unit, unarmed and noticeably haggard. He offered no reaction to our Agents&#39; guns being drawn at them, simply getting down on his knees with his hands above their head.

UIU-507 was brought into questioning, where he divulged that he was disillusioned with living such a violent and reckless life, after &#34;going [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lily-s-proposal|somewhere beautiful&#34;]]].[[footnote]]UIU-507 refused to elaborate on this statement.[[/footnote]]

Tobias Yelez was offered clemency for the murder of Colonel Mayford and the other people that he had killed, in exchange for becoming a full-time, paid member of the Union Investigations Unit. After two days of deliberation, he accepted our agreement.
