**Item #:** SCP-1870

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to its location, containment of SCP-1870 requires only minimal on-site supervision to keep anomalous activity confined.  On-site personnel are tasked with interviewing and documenting behavior of entities housed within SCP-1870.

//**Update:** Per O5 directive no further personnel are allowed access to SCP-1870.  Entrances to the site have been sealed and radio broadcasts from the site have been disabled.  Any other communications received from within SCP-1870 are to be immediately deleted with no records kept.//

**Description:** SCP-1870 is an underground complex located in ██████████, ██████, superficially built for the containment and transfer of anomalous objects.  Records recovered from SCP-1870 indicate a relationship with the Foundation, although the Foundation has no records of any such facility prior to the discovery and containment of SCP-1870 itself.  The anomalous properties of SCP-1870 are inherent to the location itself and its inhabitants.  Most of the objects contained within SCP-1870 are not anomalous despite extensive on-site records which claim otherwise.  

SCP-1870 is populated by six to ten humanoid entities which share the following characteristics:

* Constantly changing facial features, often in drastic manners which do not align with standard bilateral symmetry.
* An understanding of Foundation policy and history that, while incorrect, is detailed enough to present a serious security issue.
* Detailed knowledge of several contained objects and entities.
* An outer epidermis that resembles elaborate but functionless tactical gear.  While some portions of this epidermis can be removed, doing so improperly causes great pain or distress to the entity.
* An obsession with improvised weaponry such as gardening implements and power tools, most of which are tactically useless.

While the entities often exhibit individual traits, a detailed accounting of their numbers or precise origins have proved impossible to keep.  Even under direct observation the number of entities within a closed room will change and some entities have been observed in multiple locations simultaneously.  Due to the fluid nature of SCP-1870 entities no permanent designations have been set to distinguish them.

Entities spend their time in training exercises and performing experiments with the non-anomalous objects stored on site.

Examples of the non-anomalous objects stored within SCP-1870 are:

* A gallery of poorly stuffed and mounted wildlife.  Detailed records are kept on each specimen outlining a mission in which the animals were captured and contained, although the dates on the records do not match the confirmed ages of the specimens.
* Seventeen vintage television sets.
* Excerpts from an unpublished book on home improvement, author unknown.
* A box of fluorescent light bulbs.
* Living quarters for &#34;Doctor Steampunk,&#34; an inanimate suit of 17th century ceremonial plate armor with brass cogs welded across its surface.
* A pinball machine, with erroneous records describing it as a &#34;Roman-era video game console.&#34;
* A credenza-mounted record player.
* Twenty-seven copies of a compilation album titled //&#34;Greatest Party Jams 1990&#34;// on compact disc.
* A box of pamphlets titled //&#34;How to Keep Your Facial Features Properly Arranged.&#34;// Experiment records claim that subjects who read the pamphlet are capable of altering their facial features at will, but only while in possession of a pamphlet.  The pamphlets do not possess any anomalous properties at all and appear to be unrelated to the nature of SCP-1870 entities.  An example copy is kept in File Room AE2.  //(Update: Records in File Room AE2 were damaged by an environmental control failure.  The example copy was not recovered.)//

**Excerpt from Interview 1870-E-4, conducted by E-class Agents D███████ and X███:**

&gt; Agent D███████: Please state your name.
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-1870 entity:  Agent Redacted.
&gt; 
&gt; Agent D███████: Your name is &#39;redacted&#39;?
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-1870 entity: Yes, &#34;Agent Redacted.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Agent X███: Why are you carrying a power drill?
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-1870 entity: For luck. I once took out fifty SCP-███ with it.
&gt; 
&gt; Agent D███████: Records on SCP-███ are sealed.  What can you tell us about them?
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-1870 entity: [DATA EXPUNGED] //(the answer was confirmed correct by O5. However, there have been no SCP-███ outbreaks within the last fifty years)//

**Addendum:** The original personnel files for Agent D███████ and Agent X███ have been lost due to clerical error and local database corruption.  It is not known when they returned from SCP-1870 or where they were later assigned.
