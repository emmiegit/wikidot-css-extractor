    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>Born in a world whose name is now well lost to history, M贸nos was once court philosopher to the kings of his homeland. Unfortunately, his curiosity often got the better of him, and he was exiled from his home after uncovering secrets that powerful beings wanted to be kept quiet. Having wandered across many strange and myriad worlds, the philosopher eventually settled in the Library, where he devotes much of his time to chronicling tales of his home, and searching for ways to return. You may recognize him by his tattered blue cloak and the constant aroma of wood smoke, and he is always happy to chat with fellow patrons.
