**Item #:** SCP-2412

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2412 is to be kept inside a cell, furnished with whatever the subject requests, in reasonable limits. SCP-2412-1 and SCP-2412-2 are to be kept inside a different, locked room, with at least one (1) guard on duty at all times. SCP-2412-3a through 3i should be located in a special stable, provided with all necessary resources. 

**Note:** In light of incident 2412-A, which resulted in a worldwide [DATA EXPUNGED], SCP-2412 is to be released from his cell at ████ each December 24th, and given access to SCP-2412-1 through 3i. He then is to be allowed to leave the facility for █ hours, but not before a tracking device is installed on SCP-2412-2. Normally, SCP-2412 willfully returns to his place of containment after the scheduled time has passed; if this does not occur, follow emergency procedure P2412A immediately. 

**Description:** Apprehended in Lapland in ████. Subject appears to be an elderly male of vaguely Caucasian heritage. SCP-2412 has stated that he is content with staying in the Foundation&#39;s custody, as long as his &#34;yearly job&#34; is not hampered. 

At time of capture, the following artifacts were in SCP-2412&#39;s possession:

* **SCP-2412-1** - Appears to be an ordinary leather sack, filled with a number of objects, packed in typical decorative gift wrapping. Removal of any of those objects is impossible without SCP-2412&#39;s approval. This approval is given to some researchers and refused to others; there does not seem to be a pattern to this, although staff with numerous transgressions on their disciplinary reports is typically denied acquisition of any of the products of SCP-2412-1. The artifact appears to refill itself with new &#34;gifts&#34; at a steady rate; the source of them is unknown. Objects produced by SCP-2412-1 have so far exhibited no extraordinary properties, although all are of very good quality. 
* **SCP-2412-2** - For all intents and purposes, a large wooden sled. Displays unusual resistance both to physical trauma and to heat. Designed to be pulled by SCP-2412-3a through 3i, and while this is ongoing, SCP-2412-2 is considered an airborne vehicle of average manoeuverability. 
* **SCP-2412-3a through 3i** - Nine biological specimens. Appear to belong to an unknown species of //Rangifer.// Similar to ordinary reindeer, save for the capability of flight. This is baffling, as none of the specimens are equipped with wings or any other such organ. SCP-2412-3i has been requested by SCP-2412 to be situated, when pulling SCP-2412-2 with the other specimens, in the lead. Failure to adhere to this guideline may result in violent [DATA EXPUNGED]. The nose of SCP-2412-3i displays an abnormally red coloration; it is likely to be a result of a mutation. 

**Addendum:** Possible ties between SCP-2412 and [[[SCP-190]]] are being investigated. 

**Dr. ██████████&#39;s Report, 25th Dec ████:** As ordered, a satellite tracking device has been installed on SCP-2412-2 before release. Results are hard to interpret. The tandem of SCP-2412 and all the sub-SCPs apparently was capable of clearing very high distances within seconds (this is theorized to be a form of teleportation), and even co-existing in numerous locations at once. When asked to name the party responsible for these anomalies, SCP-2412 replied simply &#34;Magic.&#34; and refused to elaborate.
