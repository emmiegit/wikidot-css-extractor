&#34;Are you sure that&#39;s not painful for you?&#34;

Iglesias watched Ixmucane struggle against the void, moving with labored steps to summon the fragments of memories that existed somewhere deep in Sias&#39;s psyche. With every session, her movements became labored and the stars took longer and longer to manifest.

&#34;I do not feel pain,&#34; Ixmucane responded flatly, &#34;The labor you see is metaphoric. A visual representation of the effort it takes to pull forth these dreams from wherever it is that they sleep.&#34;

&#34;Wait, doesn&#39;t that imply that you&#39;re just hamming it all up for me?&#34;

Ixmucane smirked, lining up the memories she had gathered. She reached out a hand, tapping one. In response to her touch, the dreamscape came to life.

[[div class=&#34;outside&#34;]]

Ixmucane found herself in a bedroom. It wasn&#39;t particularly spacious, largely due to a clutter of clothes, papers, and art supplies strewn across the floor. A few framed photos hung on the walls, depicting Basil alongside Marc and his mother, now beginning to show some of the early signs of aging. A fairly large window was on the back wall with a wide seating space built into the windowsill, a guitar laying in it. Shoved into the back corner beside the window was a bed, with Basil fast asleep under the covers.

Ixmucane moved to investigate the sleeping child, only to be interrupted by the sound of something small hitting the window with a defined &#34;clack&#34;. Basil didn&#39;t stir. A few moments later, another clack came from the window, and another followed shortly after. After the fourth, Basil woke up and approached the window. He opened it, just as an impressively large stone flew to it and smacked into his face. He recoiled in pain, falling to the floor with his hands clasped over his forehead. He struggled back to his feet and stomped over to the window.

&#34;What the heck!&#34; he shouted down to the people below. Wyatt and a girl around his age gave a sheepish wave in return.

&#34;Hey, Basil...&#34; Wyatt hesitated, &#34;Sorry about that...&#34;

&#34;Yeah, sorry! We just wanted to wake you up!&#34; the girl added.

Ixmucane squinted, trying to take in her form. No matter how hard she tried, however, she simply couldn&#39;t make out the child&#39;s features. She appeared almost in silhouette, a black shape of a young female rather than an actual person. The silhouette spoke with the same pop and cadence of an energetic child, but by all accounts it appeared more as a hole where a person should be. Wyatt himself was similar, the features on his face less defined than before. His nose particularly was harder to make out, appearing more as the idea of a shape on his face rather than a nose proper.

Looking out onto the horizon, at least, she couldn&#39;t see the holes from before. This memory was largely intact.

&#34;Well I&#39;m awake now. What do you guys want?&#34; Basil snapped.

&#34;Shhh! You&#39;ll wake up your mom!&#34; the girl said in a panic, waving a finger in front of her mouth. Basil winced in response, casting a look behind him. Seemingly content with what he saw, he turned back to the group.

&#34;Olivia and I wanted to know if you&#39;d come see the stars with us!&#34; Wyatt said, a sense of pride in his voice, &#34;I promised I&#39;d take you to the hill someday, yeah?&#34;

&#34;The hill?&#34; Basil responded, cocking his head to the side.

&#34;The hill where you can see the stars really well!&#34; The female shape Ixmucane could only assume was Olivia said, &#34;Just outside of town! It&#39;s so clear tonight, you&#39;ll be able to see them really well!&#34;

Basil cast another hesitant look back over his shoulder. Content with whatever it was he did or didn&#39;t see, he nodded and hoisted himself out the window.

&#34;Wait!&#34; Wyatt yelped as Basil attempted to climb down the exterior of his house, only to lose his grip halfway down and begin falling. Wyatt raced over in a vain attempt to catch Basil, only to end up with Basil crashing down on top of him.

&#34;Are you two ok?&#34; Olivia asked, sincere concern in her voice. Wyatt gave a weak thumbs-up, and Basil merely shrugged.

&#34;Could&#39;ve been worse. This is me getting back at you for the rock earlier,&#34; Basil stated.

The kids gathered together by Olivia and Wyatt&#39;s bikes. Olivia and Wyatt took their seats, with Basil balancing on the back pegs of Wyatt&#39;s bike with his hands firmly grasping Wyatt&#39;s shoulders. They took off, Ixmucane floating along beside them. She could feel a phantom breeze blowing through her hair and headdress as she watched the kids pedal along. Towards the end, she could make out a smile on Basil&#39;s face and even a faint blush on his cheeks.

They all arrived to the hill, hopping off their bikes and finding a place to lay out in the grass. It was a wide open stretch of land coated in verdant grass, appearing to stretch out endlessly in each direction. The sky above was a blank void at first, but as the time passed it began developing into a kaleidoscope of interstellar color and light. Ixmucane felt herself smiling looking at the sky above, and turning back she saw the same smiles on the children.

&#34;Wow...&#34; Basil said, eyes bright, &#34;It&#39;s really... I dunno how to describe it. Pretty?&#34;

&#34;Pretty works, if you want to be real basic about it,&#34; Olivia smirked, &#34;Gorgeous! Captivating! Beautiful! A natural wonder! Now that&#39;s how you get poetic about it!&#34;

&#34;But pretty works. Pretty is accurate,&#34; Wyatt added.

&#34;Yeah you //would// back him up,  @@ @@ @@ @@ @@ @@ @@ @@ @@ @@&#34;

Ixmucane stopped for a moment, attempting to process what she heard as Iglesias&#39;s voice rang in her ears.

&#34;You heard that too, right? That... what would it be, dead air?&#34;

&#34;Correct, yes,&#34; Ixmucane cast a look to the kids. The shape called Olivia was unchanged, as was Basil, but Wyatt seemed slightly less defined than before. The details on his hair seemed to have faded, the shape and length of it flickering and changing the more she looked at it. She turned back and looked to the sky. The colors remained just as vibrant and clear as before. This time, however, an approximation of the moon was visible as well, appearing almost like an origami approximation of the real thing. Basil&#39;s eyes remained transfixed on the sky above. 

&#34;There are so many stars,&#34; he said, barely a whisper.

&#34;That&#39;s it?&#34; Olivia said, incredulous, &#34;&#39;There are lots of stars&#39;? Come on, Basil! You can do better!&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m not a writer,&#34; he retorted, voice flat, &#34;I&#39;m just sayin&#39; what I see.&#34;

&#34;What about in Spanish?&#34; Wyatt asked. Basil sat up, looking over to the other boy quizzically. &#34;What would you say in Spanish?&#34; Wyatt continued, turning his head to Basil.

&#34;Uhm,&#34; Basil thought for a moment, &#34;Qué hermosa vista del espacio.&#34;

&#34;Now we&#39;re getting somewhere!&#34; Olivia exclaimed, &#34;Now what&#39;s it mean?&#34;

&#34;What a pretty view of space.&#34;

&#34;You are KILLING me, Basil,&#34; she groaned in feigned frustration. Basil merely smirked in response.

&#34;We all have our own words for things,&#34; Wyatt said, &#34;That&#39;s what dad tells me, anyway. But!&#34;

Wyatt stood, stretching his arms over his head.

&#34;We should probably go home now.&#34;

Wyatt and Olivia started walking back to their bikes. Basil stopped Wyatt with a small noise.

&#34;Hm? Whassup Basil?&#34;

&#34;Thanks. For tonight,&#34; Basil responded with a stutter. Wyatt simply smiled.

&#34;No problem, I always keep my promises! Happy birthday, Basil!&#34;

With a flash the scene changed again, with Basil attempting to climb his house and get back into his room. As he threw a leg over the window, he froze, his face growing pale. Sitting on his bed, a cup of coffee clasped in her hands, was his mother. She looked to her son with a knowing smirk.

&#34;Have fun out there?&#34;

&#34;I... um...&#34; Basil sputtered, casting his eyes towards his feet. His mother chuckled.

&#34;Calm down, calm down. I&#39;m not about to chew you out.&#34;

Basil&#39;s head popped up, eyes wide. &#34;You&#39;re not?&#34;

His mother shook her head. &#34;Nope.&#34;

&#34;But aren&#39;t you mad?&#34;

His mother took a long sip from her cup. When she lowered it, she furrowed her brows into an exaggeratedly quizzical expression, eyes looking towards the ceiling.

&#34;Hmm... my little boy snuck out of the house in the middle of the night, got muddy footprints all over the side of the house, and woke me up at 5am trying to sneak back in. Am I mad?&#34; She shook her head again. &#34;Nope, I&#39;m not mad. Listen sweetie, I did some crazy things myself when I was your age. I&#39;m not //happy// that you snuck out without permission, so don&#39;t do that again,&#34; she winked, &#34;but you came back, you&#39;re safe, and you had fun, right?&#34;

Basil gave an eager nod. His mother smiled.

&#34;Then that&#39;s all that matters. Make sure you clean that mud off the house tomorrow, and make sure you get permission in the future. Now! Get some sleep, see you in the morning sweetie.&#34;

That night, Dr. Iglesias visited her mother for the first time in months. Arriving on her doorstep, Iglesias felt an overwhelming sense of guilt and anxiety build in her stomach. Her hand hesitated, balled into a fist ready to knock on the door. It hung in the air, shaking slightly. She swallowed hard, and finally forced herself to rap lightly on the door.

&#34;Just a minute!&#34; a warm, bouncy voice came from the other side. Iglesias wanted to vomit.

Finally the door opened, a stout woman with shock white hair on the other side. Her smile was wide and warm, and she brushed what appeared to be flour off of her gnarled knuckles onto her pink apron.

&#34;Esperanza! Mija!&#34; the woman exclaimed, wrapping Iglesias into a tight hug. Iglesias hesitated, before finally wrapping stiff arms around her in return.

&#34;How have you been? Have you been eating? You look hungry!&#34; The woman fired off a rapid string of questions before grabbing Iglesias by the hand and dragging her inside. The next thing she knew, she was sat down at a table with a plate piled high with tamales sitting in front of her. The old woman say across the table with an expectant grin. Iglesias took a tamale, eying it over before finally taking a bite.

&#34;You haven&#39;t said a word yet, Esperanza. What&#39;s wrong?&#34;

Iglesias swallowed and sighed.

&#34;Mama, was I a good kid growing up?&#34;

Mrs. Iglesias&#39;s smile faded, replaced by one filled with worry.

&#34;Of course, mija, why would you ask such a thing?&#34;

&#34;Just stuff at work.&#34;

&#34;And how is work? Is it making you happy?&#34;

Iglesias paused, a half eaten tamale in her hand. She thought for a moment.

&#34;I think so, yes. More or less. I feel... like I&#39;m helping people, at least a bit.&#34;

&#34;And that&#39;s why I say you were a good kid growing up,&#34; Mrs. Iglesias responded with a firm nod, &#34;You&#39;ve always had that desire to help others, even as a little one. Every child makes mistakes, does something frustrating. Sometimes you get mad and lash out.&#34;

Mrs. Iglesias gave her daughter a knowing smile. Iglesias sank into her seat a little.

&#34;But,&#34; she continued, &#34;Even with those mistakes, no child is truly bad. As a parent you&#39;ll always worry about them.&#34;

Mrs. Iglesias reached out, taking her daughter&#39;s hand into her own and giving it a small squeeze.

&#34;And it will frustrate you to no end knowing there comes a time that you can&#39;t be there to ease their burdens. In the end, though, you&#39;ll be so proud of who they are and what they accomplish. Remember that, Esperanza, your mama is proud of you.&#34;

Iglesias sat in silence, feeling something wet roll down her cheek. Her mother lifted a thumb to wipe it away.

&#34;Thank you, mama.&#34;

[[div class=&#34;outside&#34;]]

Sias awoke in a black void that had become all too familiar to him. An empty space, one haunted by the idea that something, //something// should be there. He stood, rising slowly to unsteady feet and turned his eyes to whatever sky would exist.

In the distance, a paper moon shone down on him. A mocking approximation of the real thing.

&#34;There&#39;s no use in pretending you aren&#39;t here, then,&#34; he said, closing his eyes, &#34;I don&#39;t particularly have patience for your nonsense right now, anyway.&#34;

The ground below Sias boiled and thrashed. He took a single step back as a melting black form heaved and throbbed from whatever existed below. The form thrashed against unseen restraints, before being thrusted back down below. After a moment, a ceramic skull colored like a cruel mockery of a calavera rose to the top. It fixed very real eyes on Sias, and attempted to speak. Instead it spewed forth more of the inky, thick black substance that made up the void, filling the space with the echoing sound of choked coughs.

&#34;Please, take all the time needed,&#34; Sias said, arms crossed, &#34;I&#39;ve got questions, but I also have all night.&#34;

&#34;You...&#34; the skull coughed in a hoarse voice, &#34;Jailor...&#34;

&#34;Don&#39;t pretend to be a Librarian, it&#39;s a bad look. Listen, as frustratingly awkward as it is to have a conversation with ##green|someone who is no more##, I also need answers. I had a dream recently, and that //thing// up there appeared in it,&#34; Basil pointed an accusatory finger at the paper moon in the sky above, &#34;And there&#39;s only one ##green|beast## I can think of that uses that as a calling card. These holes in my head, ##green|the king of nothing in chains before me## is the reason why, right?&#34;

The skull didn&#39;t move, eyes fixed on Sias&#39;s own.

&#34;I know I&#39;ve never taken amnestics, so that&#39;s not it. I know depression can affect memories, but not to this scale. Let me tell ##green|the filth in my mind## something,&#34; Sias growled, &#34;I&#39;m losing faces, real ones. I&#39;m looking at my own family and I can&#39;t even recognize my husband&#39;s name or face. What does ##green|the chattering skull## want?&#34;

The skull laughed, its eyes rattling in its head.

&#34;I did a favor by taking the pain from your head, Foundation. You had your chance to reciprocate the kindness, and yet-&#34;

&#34;I made no agreements with you,&#34; Sias spat back, &#34;Don&#39;t pretend like we made a deal.&#34;

&#34;You know what I want already. You dance around it with your words.&#34;

&#34;Are you not content with the ##green|name## you were given?&#34;

The skull screeched, rattling the space with its rage.

&#34;A foul //MOCKERY// of a name! Vile poison that burns the very tongue when spoken!&#34;

&#34;Tough. You&#39;re stuck with it. I&#39;m not one to bestow such a //pleasure// on those who hurt my family,&#34; Basil hissed, crossing his arms.

The skull threw its jaw back and let loose a piercing scream that tore through the void surrounding them both. Sias remained unphased, stepping forward and placing a boot atop it.

&#34;Mind the temper tantrum. Whatever it is ##green|the thief## stole from me, it&#39;s clear my friend is getting it back. If ##green|the calavera## gets in the way, I will personally ensure that it gets locked away somewhere far worse than here. Am I clear?&#34;

The skull laughed. Mustering what strength it could, it heaved itself upwards with the liquid void that surrounded it. It pushed itself as close to Sias&#39;s face as it could, wrapping two inky black tendrils around his shoulders. It spoke in a harsh whisper into his ear, void substance dripping from its mouth and eyes.

&#34;Take back what was taken. The doll princess can do whatever it is she pleases. Your bindings are being cut free, but so are mine, Warden. I will ensure it is the only thing you do not forget.&#34;

Sias threw the creature off of him. The skull continued cackling as it fell to the ground, the void consuming it once more. Once it was well and truly gone, Sias collapsed to his feet and let the tears fall as his breathing quickened.

&#34;Please, Iglesias, I need this to work.&#34;
