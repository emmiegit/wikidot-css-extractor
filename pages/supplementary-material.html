[[tab +Glossary]]

This is a glossary of terms that may be found within this essay, for those who are confused or simply too new to know. They are not in alphabetical order at this time, although they may alphabetized at some point in the future.

lolFoundation(Adjective/Noun): A term describing writing designed to make the Foundation look silly, incompetent, or that it is employed by pranksters. //See {{Keter Duty}}.//

Keter Duty(Noun): Colloquial term for humorous addenda, which threaten to send personnel to &#34;Keter Duty&#34;(Work on dangerous objects or high risk areas) if they continue to misbehave. Very uncommon due to being purged by Pig_Catapult in February of 2012. http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-443524

SCP(Noun): An acronym, standing for &#34;Special Containment Procedures&#34;, &#34;Secure, Contain, Protect&#34;, or &#34;Secure Containment Protocols&#34; depending on who you ask and the context in which it is used.

#Site19(Noun): The name of the SCP Foundation official IRC chatroom.

EditThis(Noun): A wiki farm that was the first home of the SCP Series. Functioned as a Wikipedia clone, with an almost identical layout. Used for several months in 2008, followed by a move to WikiDot.

Kitchen Peppers(Noun): A pseudonym for the SCP Wiki user &#34;Reject&#34;.

SCP Series(Noun): The initial name of the SCP Foundation, when our content consisted primarily of the SCP list without tales, a real cohesive canon to build off of. Fell out of use and was replaced by &#34;SCP Foundation&#34;.

SCP Foundation(Noun): The name of the collaborative fiction website you&#39;re reading about now. A clandestine organization that works to contain anomalous objects and preserve the normalcy of the earth. From the &#34;About the SCP Foundation&#34; page:

SS(Noun): Shorthand for &#34;Senior Staff&#34;, the people who run the SCP Wiki.

Project Foundation(Noun): The new website that will host the SCP Foundation, currently being developed by [[*user DrMagnus]].

&gt; ++ The Foundation
&gt; 
&gt; Clandestine and worldwide, The SCP Foundation operates beyond jurisdiction, empowered and entrusted by every major world government with the task of containing &#39;items which jeopardize normalcy.&#39;
&gt; 
&gt; Many of these &#39;items&#39; pose both a physical danger to people and a psychological mistrust in worldly affairs, their personal beliefs, and an interruption to daily life.
&gt; * //exempli gratia//   - the average individual might be quite troubled by the existence of [[[SCP-126]]], believing there could be many like her present at any time.
&gt; * //exempli gratia//   - daunted by the fact that mankind is threatened by [[[SCP-008]]] or [[[SCP-058]]]
&gt; * //exempli gratia//   - the likelihood that many people would submit to or even worship subjects such as [[[SCP-076]]] or [[[SCP-882]]]

The SCP wiki has existed since 2007 in various forms, starting on /x/, then to EditThis, then to WikiDot.

RP(Noun): Shorthand term for &#34;Roleplaying.&#34;

LBD(Noun): Shorthand for &#34;Le Blue Dude,&#34; a user who was banned for being perpetually annoying. Active during the Wacky HiJinx era, has several articles which still exist on the wiki.

Wacky HiJinx era(Noun): The era from early 2009 to June of that year, where the wiki had a silly and very comedic tone to it. Where the terms &#34;Keter Duty&#34;, &#34;LOLFoundation&#34; and &#34;Decommissioning&#34; originate. 

FUDGE(Adjective): A system of IRC dice rolling commonly used in SCP Foundation RP&#39;s. 

sockpuppeting(Verb): The act of creating an additional account to avoid a ban, inflate vote counts, or do other things that can be accomplished with a second account.

Sorting(Verb): The act of pooping in a secret place, named for the SCP Foundation Administrator and Chat Operator.
