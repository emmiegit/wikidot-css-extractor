**Special Containment Procedures:**[[footnote]]**Pagnum:** Item facilitates its own form of self-containment.[[/footnote]] With approval from Site-400&#39;s present Site Director, SCP-6562 has been granted permission to continue her long-term employment with the Foundation. However, she is to refrain from using her properties unless consent and confirmation is given from the individual(s) she intends to &#34;hear&#34;. Failure to comply will result in SCP-6562 receiving appropriate disciplinary action.

Additionally, high-ranking personnel (specifically those possessing Level 5 clearance and above) are to avoid from interacting with SCP-6562, in fear that she might hear sensitive information that would compromise the integrity of the Foundation&#39;s command structure.
----
**Description:** SCP-6562 is the designation given to Dr. Celestine &#34;Celesty&#34; Addilyn, --the Head-- of Site-400&#39;s Department of Humanoid Compensation and Intercommunication. SCP-6562 is an adult female of Irish-Canadian descent, 162 centimeters in height with blue eyes and brown hair tied into a cornrow braid.

To summarize, SCP-6562 possesses a common form of one-sided telepathy. When in the proximity of one or more human individual(s), SCP-6562 is capable of inwardly &#34;hearing&#34; their inner thoughts and conception. SCP-6562 reported that these thoughts often converse with themselves in the voice of the person thinking them.

It is important to note that SCP-6562&#39;s anomalous property is only limited to the thoughts an individual is //currently// thinking, and that she is not capable of &#34;sifting&#34; through one&#39;s past memories and/or previous experiences.
----
**Addendum 6562-1, Notable Events:** The following is a list of known incidents where SCP-6562 failed to obey her containment procedures and utilized it&#39;s properties:

||~ Date ||~ Incident Description ||~ Aftermath ||
||= 09/03/2019 || While conducting a weekly amenity cost survey on some of the humanoid anomalies in Site-400, SCP-6562 briefly heard the thoughts of SCP-████[[footnote]]A human adolescent male possessing anomalous metallurgical properties.[[/footnote]], who intended to breach containment that very day. SCP-6562 reported this to on-site security, who immediately apprehended and detained SCP-████, whom would confessed to orchestrate a breach via the use of makeshift explosives he&#39;d created. || Due to the nature of this incident, SCP-6562 did not receive disciplinary action. ||
||= 27/08/2019 || Following [[[scp-7170|the destruction of the Demonic Research Lab]]] by a then-unknown Chaos Insurgency mole, multiple staff members stationed at Site-400 developed feelings of distrust among their fellow colleagues. SCP-6562, without direct permission, began using her properties to solve the identity of the mole and expose them. This would eventually lead her to suspect [{{CLASSFIED DATA REMOVED}}]. After notifying on-site security, it was discovered that the individual was, in fact, operating under the Insurgency, leading them to be taken taken to Site-██ for required information extraction. || SCP-6562 did not receive disciplinary action. Instead, for her commendable service to the Foundation in seeking out the mole, SCP-6562 was awarded the Foundation Bronze Star. ||
||= 14/12/2020 || During an annual visit by an Overseer liaison at Site-400, SCP-6562 would unintentionally break containment protocol and interacted with the liaison in question while they were both in the women&#39;s bathroom[[footnote]] Afterwards, SCP-6562 explained that she did not know that the individual was a high-ranking liaison, only thinking that they were a regular visitor from a different Foundation facility.[[/footnote]]. Due to this, SCP-6562 overheard highly sensitive information regarding the true identity of four Overseer Council members. Later, SCP-6562 would communicate said information to two of her colleagues, who in turn spread it to the entirety of Site-400 via SCiPnet&#39;s online messaging software. Once Site Director Desmond was alerted of this circumstance, he immediately initiated Emergency Protocol 489-Praeterio, which successfully mass amnesticized all of Site-400&#39;s staff, including SCP-6562. || Following this incident, SCP-6562 was subsequently demoted to a Level 2 Senior Researcher, with her previous position being replaced by another Foundation personnel. Her Bronze Star was also revoked. ||
----
**Addendum 6562-2, Containment Update:** Due to the Ethics Committee&#39;s request to &#34;branch out&#34; the Department of Humanoid Compensation and Intercommunication to other Foundation facilities housing humanoid entities, SCP-6562 was ordered to transfer out of Site-400 in order to ease and give assistance with the integration of the Department.

As of August 3rd, 2021, SCP-6562 is currently stationed at Biological Research Site-188, located in Valdez, Alaska. Her containment procedures has been updated to accommodate this.

**Addendum 6562-3, Audio Transcript:** On September 29th, 2021, Junior Researcher Seachlann Fionntan, who is currently stationed at Site-400, received a call from SCP-6562 through his personal mobile phone. The following is a transcript of the conversation that transpired between the two individuals:

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

= **&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;**

//Phone call commences.//

**Rs. Fionntan:** This is Seachlann.

//Faint rustling.//

**Rs. Fionntan:** Hello?

**SCP-6562:** Oh, hey. It&#39;s Celesty. Didn&#39;t think you&#39;d pick up, Lann. Been calling you since yesterday.

**Rs. Fionntan:** Hey, Cee. Yeah, sorry &#39;bout that. Just busy with some stuff, y&#39;know?

**SCP-6562:** Ah, okay. I&#39;ll call you another time then-

**Rs. Fionntan:** No, no, it&#39;s fine. Really, I&#39;m actually was just gonna finish up on this anyways. So, what&#39;s up with you? How&#39;s it going at One-Eighty-Eight? They treatin&#39; you good?

**SCP-6562:** Yeah, no, they&#39;re really nice and welcoming and all of that. Gotta be honest though, it does feel like it&#39;s cramped as hell. Heard that they decided to doubled down on the extra rooms for building testing areas or whatever. But I guess that&#39;s expected for a Site having &#34;Biological&#34; in their name. You feel me?

**Rs. Fionntan:** Bacteria and viruses and shit. Yeah, I got you. (//chuckles//) So, uhh, why&#39;d you call me? Thought we were gonna meet up for Halloween next month. You good?

**SCP-6562:** (//sighs deeply//) Alright, I gotta be honest with you, Lann. Something&#39;s not right with this place. Like, //really// not right. Even by 400&#39;s standards.

**Rs. Fionntan:** What? What&#39;re you saying?

**SCP-6562:** I don&#39;t know how, but... I think these guys here ain&#39;t what they say they are.

**Rs. Fionntan:** Wait, hold on, what? Oh Jesus Christ, Cee. Did... did you use your &#34;hearing&#34; thing again? C&#39;mon, man, you know you&#39;re gonna get in trouble for that if anyone-

**SCP-6562:** No, shut up, Lann! Just shut the hell up! You gotta listen to me, please. //Ask// me what I heard when I used it. C&#39;mon, just ask me.

**Rs. Fionntan:**  (//under his breath//) God fuckin&#39; hell. Okay, Cee, what&#39;d you hear? Embezzlement? Bribery? Drugs? Some bullshit with the Insurgency?

**SCP-6562:** Nothing.

**Rs. Fionntan:** Huh?

**SCP-6562:** I said I heard //nothing//. (//voice breaking//) I see them smiling and talking to me, and yet... their heads... It&#39;s goddamn //silent//. I&#39;m so used to hearing so many voices that... Like there&#39;s just an empty space between where their brains are supposed to be.

**Rs. Fionntan:** Cee, you&#39;re not making sense.

**SCP-6562:** I don&#39;t expect you to understand, Lann. In fact, I never did. All I&#39;m asking is for you to send-

//Faint knocking.//

**Rs. Fionntan:** Cee?

**SCP-6562:** Shit, they found me. I gotta go. Look, just tell somebody about this, okay? Someone like Desmond. Make sure they send a team or whatever. I can&#39;t be-

//Phone call terminates.//

= **&lt;END LOG&gt;**

[[/div]]

Jr. Researcher Fionntan would report the above call to Director Desmond, followed by representatives of the Emergent Threat Tactical Response Authority (ETTRA). Request to dispatch a Mobile Task Force to Site-188 for investigation and potentially neutralization purposes is currently awaiting approval.
