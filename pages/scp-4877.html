[[include component:image-block name=mohercliffs.jpeg|caption=Cliffs of Moher, Ireland. A common location for SCP-4877 occurrences.]]

**Item #:** SCP-4877

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All individuals who demonstrate understanding of SCP-4877 are to be questioned. Once all possible information regarding SCP-4877 has been extracted, these individuals are to be amnestized and released. Any pictures, videos or other media depicting or describing SCP-4877 are to be removed by Foundation webcrawlers. 

Should individuals who have been linked to SCP-4877 disappear for longer than seven days, a duplicate body is to be prepared in order to fake the individual&#39;s death under the cover story that they died after falling from a great height. 

**Description:** SCP-4877 is a phenomenon which can reduce the force of gravity that is applied to an individual during free fall. The exact circumstances needed to trigger this phenomenon are not well understood; however, initial research suggests the following:

* SCP-4877 can be triggered by any individual.
* The individual must be in free fall.
* The individual must be consciously attempting to trigger SCP-4877.
* The individual must close their eyes.

It is believed that there are additional requirements, both physically and mentally, that are fulfilled prior to a successful triggering of SCP-4877. Due to the lack of concrete resources regarding SCP-4877, the Foundation has been unable to confirm the exact steps necessary.  

**Discovery:** SCP-4877 was brought to the Foundation&#39;s attention following the posting of a video to YouTube which gained approximately 30,000 views in under an hour.

&gt; &lt;**00:00**&gt; Black screen. Centered caption: &#34;Flight Classes: Final Exam&#34;.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;**00:04**&gt; Boy stands at the edge of a cliff by the sea. Late teens, long black hair, slim frame. Several young men and women are on the edge of the camera frame, talking; more linger off-screen. The wind flapping against the microphone drowns out all other sounds.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;**00:10**&gt; A bald man in his mid-forties enters the frame. He wears a Hawaiian shirt and sweat pants. The man approaches and places his hands on the boy&#39;s shoulders. The two exchange words that are drowned out by the wind. 
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;**00:44**&gt; The man smiles, pats the boy&#39;s back, and exits the frame. 
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;**01:08**&gt; Camera pans over the edge of the cliff. Waves crash against rocks that jut out of the water. Camera pans back to the boy. 
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;**01:14**&gt; The boy runs and jumps off of the cliff.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;**01:20**&gt; The boy is impaled on the rocks.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;**01:23**&gt; Camera pans back to the audience gathered at the edge of the cliff. The audience applauds. Their expressions remain neutral.

The video was taken down by YouTube soon after gaining popularity for violating its community guidelines. Initially the video was not marked as anomalous, but due to the strange behavior demonstrated, a fledgling investigation was conducted by Junior Researcher Abagail Lin. 

Lin identified the location of the video to be the southern edge of the Cliffs of Moher in Ireland. After determining that the cliff is approximately 120m tall, Lin noted that the fall from the video lasted almost a second longer than it should have. 

**Addendum SCP-4877-1:** Following the formal designation of the phenomenon observed in the posted video as SCP-4877, Researcher Lin identified the boy as seventeen-year-old Aston Cucher. An Garda Síochána[[footnote]] The Irish Government&#39;s law enforcement organization[[/footnote]] confirmed that Cucher had indeed died during the incident. Additional details regarding the events shown in the video were not disclosed to law enforcement officials to guarantee they would not interfere in a Foundation investigation.

Lin also identified the bald man who spoke to Cucher as Rainbow[[footnote]]Legally changed from Dennis Freedman in 1996[[/footnote]]. After obtaining his address and contact information, Researcher Lin volunteered to interview Rainbow under the guise of a civilian seeking to learn about OneLeap.

&gt; &lt;**Begin Log**&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; //Lin enters the coffee shop where she agreed to meet with Rainbow. He is seated at a table for two near the window, drinking out of a mug. Lin stops next to the table.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** Umm... hello. Are you uh, Rainbow?
&gt; 
&gt; //Rainbow turns to face Lin, but appears to look past her.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Rainbow:** And you— you must be the one they call Catherine.[[footnote]] The alias that Lin assumed when communicating with Rainbow.[[/footnote]] Good airwaves. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** Can I take a seat?
&gt; 
&gt; **Rainbow:** Vibe out however you like. Sitting, standing, jumping jacks. Just let yourself be comfortable. Good airwaves.
&gt; 
&gt; //Lin sits down. Rainbow does not make eye contact with her.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** So uhh, I guess I saw that video you guys posted a week ago and I got interested. But I&#39;m still not totally sure what you do...
&gt; 
&gt; **Rainbow:** There&#39;s no use in //doing// things. We&#39;re all about feeling things. Like good airwaves.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** I&#39;m not sure I follow. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Rainbow:** That&#39;s the sound of someone thinking with their head, instead of their internal dioxceline receptors. 
&gt; 
&gt; //Rainbow takes a pen from his shirt pocket and uses it to scribble an address and a time on a napkin. When he finishes, Rainbow makes eye contact with Lin for the first time.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Rainbow:** Leap before you look, my gal. Good airwaves.
&gt; 
&gt; //Rainbow stands up from the table and staggers out of the coffee shop.//
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;**End Log**&gt;

Due to the lack of information gathered by the interview, Project Lead Dr. Teller decided that an investigation would be formed to infiltrate the OneLeap group and gather information. Usual protocol dictates that field agents are to be selected for extended field work; however, Researcher Lin was chosen due to her expected presence by Rainbow.

**Addendum SCP-4877-2:** The following is a series of field reports submitted by Researcher Lin during her investigation of OneLeap:

[[tabview]]

[[tab Report #1]]

&gt; **Report #:** 1
&gt; 
&gt; **Date:** 4/13/2019
&gt; 
&gt; I just got back from the first meeting. I&#39;ll try to describe everything that happened but a lot of it is from memory... I forgot to bring a notebook, or even the microphone.[[footnote]] Under normal circumstances this would result in disciplinary action for a field agent, Lin was given a warning as she has never done prolonged fieldwork prior to this assignment.[[/footnote]] 
&gt; 
&gt; We met in this back room at a run down community center. I think someone brought snacks. Honestly, it reminded me of how my dad described his Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, except everyone was quieter.
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#39;t remember exactly how many people were there. I think it was around sixteen? Maybe closer to twenty? I should&#39;ve talked to them while we waited for Rainbow. He was late, but everyone acted like that was the norm. 
&gt; 
&gt; When the meeting started we all sat around in a circle on the ground, except Rainbow who used a folding chair. He started by reading something out of this little notebook he kept in his shirt pocket. I don&#39;t remember what he said. I was too nervous just trying to fit in.
&gt; 
&gt; I didn&#39;t forget my alias though. Rainbow had all the new people stand up and introduce themselves to the group. I think they thought my stutter was from nerves rather than trying to remember the right name. I wasn&#39;t the only new girl though. Her first name was Olivia, but I forgot her last name.
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#39;t really know why I&#39;m doing this. I mean, I know why, but I&#39;m more cut out for the lab. 
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;ll make sure I&#39;m more thorough with my next report, sorry.

[[tab Report #2]]

&gt; **Report #:** 2
&gt; 
&gt; **Date:** 4/18/2019
&gt; 
&gt; I took notes this time. I was too scared to wear the microphone in case one of the other members saw it, but I think the notes are thorough enough.
&gt; 
&gt; There were twelve other people at the meeting. Most of them must&#39;ve been in their twenties or thirties, but there were a few older folks. One woman must&#39;ve been in her late sixties. 
&gt; 
&gt; Today, we had a special &#34;Lecture&#34; meeting. I sometimes heard the other members call Rainbow &#34;Professor R&#34;. They seem to treat this like a night school, I guess. 
&gt; 
&gt; Instead of sitting in a circle like last time, we gathered on the ground in front of Rainbow and his folding chair. He talked for almost an hour, occasionally using this hand-held whiteboard he brought along. The structure of the speech felt like a lecture, peppered with examples and cited reading, but it sounded more like sermon.
&gt; 
&gt; I was the only one taking notes. I don&#39;t know if it was allowed or not. Either way, I didn&#39;t want to get yelled at if it was, so I sat in the back. I&#39;ll include some quotes from the lecture below, but I might&#39;ve missed something.
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; //The internet man. Stay off the internet. All the little blinky lights on screen are out to get you. You used to be able to tell what&#39;s real and what&#39;s got no soul behind it, but not any more. All I get are bad airwaves man.//
&gt; 
&gt; //You can see the strings on the fakes out there. They&#39;re all tangled and looking at their lower selves. Don&#39;t want to get mixed up with vibes that are tied down.//
&gt; 
&gt; //&#34;Filters&#34; are just what people in denial call lies.//
&gt; 
&gt; //As an exercise for later, you can ask a stranger how often they experience euphoria. Afterwards ask them the question again. Just as an exercise.//
&gt; 
&gt; //With the invention of Q-Learning and exploration strategies, we see a 300% decrease in the Dinine Radiation that chatbot AIs give off. Can anyone tell me why?//
&gt; 
&gt; //As the Wright Brothers once said, in unison, &#39;The singularity will consume us before the century is out&#39;. They really should be given more credit for that quote.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Bad airwaves man. The sky is full of them. Now the air&#39;s polluted with mechatronic signals and blue colors, all because the machines learned to fly before we did.//

[[tab Report #3]]

&gt; **Report #:** 3
&gt; 
&gt; **Date:** 4/23/2019
&gt; 
&gt; I didn&#39;t wear the microphone again. Every way I put it on I swear it wasn&#39;t hidden well enough. I might just give up on it for now. It almost made me late today.
&gt; 
&gt; This meeting was more of an open discussion. I didn&#39;t contribute. I hope that didn&#39;t make me look weird. Olivia didn&#39;t say anything either though, so I&#39;m probably fine. I&#39;ll include any memorable quotes at the end of the report again.
&gt; 
&gt; At the end of the meeting though, Rainbow declared that we were going to the &#34;Runway&#34; this weekend. Apparently Margret (the sixty year-old woman) would be taking her &#34;Final Exam&#34;. She&#39;s going to go to Rainbow&#39;s house before the exam, and then meet with the rest of us around 2PM. I don&#39;t know how I feel. She was obviously excited about it. I guess I&#39;m going to watch either way.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, after the meeting I finally spoke to Olivia. I didn&#39;t ask her much, but I got her phone number. Maybe I&#39;ll try to do an interview with her soon. Hopefully before the weekend, it&#39;d be too bad if after seeing the Final Exam she runs away and I never get a chance to talk to her.
&gt; 
&gt; -------
&gt; 
&gt; //One day I&#39;ll vibe out like a fish, man. Deep respect for fish.//
&gt; 
&gt; //You think the fish that evolved first knew what they&#39;re doing? Maybe some little voice in their heads, all &#34;I&#39;m going to go breathe air now, later my aquatic-amigos&#34;.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Vestigial, adjective - degenerate, rudimentary, or atrophied, having become functionless in the course of evolution.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Birds are evidence that time does not move at one second per second for everyone. How else could they have evolved so much faster than us?//

&gt; **Report #:** 4
&gt; 
&gt; **Date:** 4/27/2019
&gt; 
&gt; I caught up with Olivia today. We got coffee and I managed to ask her a few questions (including her full name, which is Olivia Walsh). I even wore the microphone this time! I&#39;ll just include the transcript below of the most relevant part.
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;**Begin Transcript**&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** ...  When are you planning to graduate?
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** Heh, funny you say that. I was supposed to graduate in two years but I failed out of one of my courses, which sets me back in prereqs and stuff so it&#39;s looking more like three. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** Oh, I&#39;m sorry to hear that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** Don&#39;t worry about it. It&#39;s part of why I joined OneLeap. I was uhh... sort of at my wit&#39;s end with stuff. Usually these &#34;steps to success&#34; programs are all bullshit but like, I don&#39;t know. Sometimes you need to just give the bullshit a try.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** Actually, how did you hear about OneLeap? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** There were a bunch of posters all over campus. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** Ah, I see. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** Anyways, why did you join up? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** I just saw some promotional video on YouTube. It&#39;s taken down now.
&gt;  
&gt; **Walsh:** No, no. Not how you heard about it. //Why// did you join?
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** Oh... uh. I guess I thought it would be good for me. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** You&#39;re more used to asking the questions than answering them, aren&#39;t you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** Heh, kind of. I&#39;m a researcher, so I do a bit of both. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** It sounds to me like you&#39;re here to look for answers then.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** Excuse me?
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** You know, answers. Personal answers. Answers to questions about Catherine.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** I&#39;m uh, not sure what you mean.
&gt; 
&gt; //Pause.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** Oh, sorry. I&#39;m starting to sound like Rainbow a bit, aren&#39;t I? 
&gt; 
&gt; //Walsh laughs to herself.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** Yeah. Just a bit.
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** What did you order?
&gt;  
&gt; **Lin:** Iced mocha, why do you ask?
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** I think they&#39;ve got your drink.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** Oh! I&#39;ll be right back.

&gt; **Report #:** 5
&gt; 
&gt; **Date:** 4/27/2019
&gt; 
&gt; When we got that first video, I watched it about a hundred times, just to measure the exact moment that kid&#39;s body hit the rocks for my calculations. I thought I braced myself for seeing it in person. God, I can&#39;t believe how naive I am.
&gt; 
&gt; We all met up at the cliffs, and waited around for a bit before Rainbow and the old woman arrived. No one really said anything. It was windy and cloudy. The veterans stood in complete silence by the cliffside, while Olivia, myself and a few others paced around to keep warm.
&gt; 
&gt; When Rainbow and the old woman arrived, everyone gathered at the cliff&#39;s edge. Olivia asked me a few times what was happening, but I just shrugged. Everything from there on played out like the video, except the old woman more hobbled than ran. 
&gt; 
&gt; Just watching her fall though was so... it felt wrong. Not dreadful, but just wrong. She didn&#39;t scream as she fell. It felt like it took forever. There&#39;s a good chance the woman fell for longer than the boy did in the video. Probably around 15 seconds. But it felt longer. After she hit the ground, Rainbow declared that she &#34;received a C&#34; in the course. That&#39;s when the applause started.
&gt; 
&gt; I can&#39;t express how I felt about the applause. Even Olivia clapped. I mean, I did too. I guess there was something respectable about it all. She went out on her own terms. That deserves some recognition, right?

&gt; **Report #:** 6
&gt; 
&gt; **Date:** 5/5/2019
&gt; 
&gt; Olivia came back this week. She didn&#39;t look fazed in the slightest. Although no one acknowledged that we just watched an old woman die the other day. Maybe there&#39;s some sort of memetic suppression? I don&#39;t think so though, because I can say for certain that I felt uneasy, and I don&#39;t know why I would be an exception. But Olivia looked like she felt... I don&#39;t know. More at ease? She spoke up more today than in the past. She looked happy.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyways, strange behaviors aside, we spent today talking about bonds. All different kinds of bonds. And when I say we, I&#39;m including myself for once. I don&#39;t know why I spoke up this time. Maybe I was paranoid that the others would notice something strange about me. I don&#39;t think so though, because what I said felt natural. Like, I wasn&#39;t forcing it at all. I think I&#39;m overthinking this.  
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; //Everyone vibing out right now? Good airwaves today. Good airwaves indeed. You know where those things come from right? Bonds. Wiggle a bond enough and you get waves.//
&gt; 
&gt; //... and that&#39;s why I do jumping jacks, my dude. Keeps them bonds loose.//
&gt; 
&gt; //You know, marriage used mean something. Married people gave off the best vibrations. Back before they had &#34;divorce&#34;. King Henry the Eighth ruined that all by himself.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Can anyone here tell me tell me the amount of dioxceline released when we split apart magnesium chloride? Yes, very good Olivia, 4.32 moles.//
&gt; 
&gt; //That&#39;s part of why we&#39;re all here you know. OneLeap attracts our ideal bond brothers and sisters. That&#39;s why you&#39;re all here.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Wiggle on my dudes. Good airwaves.//

&gt; **Report #:** 7
&gt; 
&gt; **Date:** 5/7/2019
&gt; 
&gt; I got in touch with Olivia again, just to have another one-on-one chat. I wanted to know why she seemed so calm. I&#39;ve seen some terrible things in my time at the Foundation, so I&#39;ve chalked up my numbness to that, but I couldn&#39;t seem to explain Olivia. The interview didn&#39;t give me a concrete answer but... well you&#39;ll see in the transcript.

&gt; **Walsh:** Are these coffees going to become a weekly thing? Because I wouldn&#39;t be against that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** I mean, they can be. I wouldn&#39;t be against it, but I don&#39;t know why you&#39;d want that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** I dunno. You&#39;re just interesting to talk to.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** Oh. Umm... thanks.
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** Anyways, you had something you wanted to talk about?
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** I wanted to talk to you about the, uh, the exam we saw a while ago.
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** What about it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** You watched a woman throw herself off a cliff, yet you still came back to the same people who told her to do it... why?
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** I mean, you came back as well. It&#39;s probably for the same reason.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** I&#39;m not sure you know why I&#39;m here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** In that case, I think I&#39;m just curious.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** Curious?
&gt; 
&gt; //Walsh thinks to herself for a moment, before leaning forward and motions for Lin to come closer. Lin also leans forward as well.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** //[quietly]// Like, after we all went home, I was feeling all kinds of things. I was scared, confused, and a bunch of other emotions that are hard to put into words. I skipped class on Monday to deal with them. And I don&#39;t know what it was, but there was something that just... clicked for me. All the talk about vibes and airwaves. It made sense. Not like, in anyway that I can describe. It just— it just fits. Like a puzzle.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** A puzzle?
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** Yeah. And now I want to see what my puzzle looks like. What&#39;s the picture? I&#39;ve been so close to the pieces I need to take a step back. Well, its a big puzzle. I think I&#39;m going to need a bird&#39;s eye view.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** I&#39;m not sure I follow.
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** I want to fly. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** But what if you fall?
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** I won&#39;t.
&gt; 
&gt; //Walsh leans back and smiles. Lin pauses for a moment before leaning back as well.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** I see...
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** Are you ok? You seem a little spaced out.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** I&#39;m fine. I think I forgot to do something back at my apartment though. I have to go. Sorry. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** No problem. We can talk more next week.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** Right. Of course. Next week. See you later.
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** Good airwaves.

&gt; **Report #:** 8
&gt; 
&gt; **Date:** 5/9/2019
&gt; 
&gt; Today Rainbow announced that Olivia would be graduating early, due to her excellent performance the past few days. She&#39;s taking the &#34;Final Exam&#34; this weekend.
&gt; 
&gt; I know I shouldn&#39;t do anything, and I&#39;m not, but like— I don&#39;t know. She looked so happy. She knows that&#39;s she&#39;s going to jump to her death though. Or, I mean I don&#39;t know any more. Maybe she flies.  I hope she flies. Her life&#39;s been too short to end on the rocks at the bottom of that cliff.
&gt; 
&gt; So much for those weekly coffees.

&gt; 
&gt; //You ever seen one of those street magicians? Good airwaves, those guys. I used to do card tricks. My parents said I was pretty good.//
&gt; 
&gt; //... sleight of hand though. Something about sleight of hand always gets me. Shit disappears right before your eyes. No screens or anything, just right there.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Studies have shown that dioxceline measurements after being shown a magic trick is higher than after witnessing a true miracle.//
&gt; 
&gt; //I should&#39;ve been a magic man. But you&#39;re not really living if you don&#39;t have regrets.//
&gt; 
&gt; //They&#39;re doing God&#39;s work, those street magicians. God&#39;s work. I bet the big man could do a mean coin routine.//

&gt; **Date:** 5/11/2019
&gt; 
&gt; She flew.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m going to try to list in as much detail as possible everything that happened, in case any of it contributes to triggering the phenomenon.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Olivia arrived with Rainbow wearing jeans and a white t-shirt. 
&gt; 2. Everyone gathered around the cliff edge she was going to jump off, just like last time.
&gt; 3. Olivia didn&#39;t act very different. The others all seemed excited and a little jumpy, but she was much calmer.
&gt; 4. Olivia lined up and took her mark. 
&gt; 5. Rainbow began to chant &#34;One Leap!&#34; over and over. Everyone (myself included) joined in.
&gt; 6. Olivia closed her eyes.
&gt; 7. Olivia jumped off the cliff.
&gt; 8. She didn&#39;t even fall, she simply went up. 
&gt; 9. Everyone standing back clapped.
&gt; 10. Rainbow declared that Olivia passed with an &#34;A+&#34; grade.
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#39;t know where she is now.[[footnote]] Foundation satellites and atmospheric imaging apparatuses have not yet located the individual.[[/footnote]] I have this feeling she&#39;s going to be ok though. I&#39;m kind of happy for her.
&gt; 
&gt; Now that I think about it a little more... I felt a certain updraft when she jumped. I wonder if those were the &#34;good airwaves&#34; that Rainbow talks about.

**Addendum SCP-4877-3:** Following Report 9, Researcher Lin&#39;s mission was considered completed, and Lin was ordered to return to her post at Site-24. After 12 hours without confirmation from Lin about her return, MTF Iota-10 (&#34;Damn Feds&#34;) were deployed to Dublin to recover Researcher Lin. The apartment that was rented for the mission was found unoccupied, with Lin&#39;s belongings inside. The following materials were recovered from Researcher Lin&#39;s computer:

&gt; **Foreword:** The following file was titled &#34;rainbow_interview_2.mp3&#34;. It appeared to be recorded on Researcher Lin&#39;s smart phone. 
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; //Background conversation can be heard, indicating that this was recorded in a public location.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** Sorry to bother you, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re busy.
&gt; 
&gt; **Rainbow:** No worries, my gal. All good vibes today.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** I just wanted to know, why did you let Olivia graduate early?
&gt; 
&gt; **Rainbow:** Feeling jumpy?
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** No! I don&#39;t want to rush it. I&#39;m just curious.
&gt; 
&gt; **Rainbow:** There&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** Umm... I&#39;m not sure I understand. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Rainbow:** Olivia was a smart gal. Caught on quick. Good airwaves.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** So there was something special about her?
&gt; 
&gt; **Rainbow:** Special? Who really is special? I don&#39;t think she&#39;s any more special than you are.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** Are you saying I could graduate?
&gt; 
&gt; **Rainbow:** I don&#39;t know. I just give the grades. Do you think you can graduate?
&gt; 
&gt; //Pause.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** I think I understand now. Thank you so much!
&gt; 
&gt; **Rainbow:** Leap before you look my gal. Good airwaves.

&gt; **Foreword:** The following file was titled &#34;01103_STREAM_v0491.mp4&#34;, which is the same naming convention as used by videos streamed from Foundation-distributed field cameras. Researcher Lin had been provided with one such camera for the purpose of her mission.

&gt; 
&gt; //Video shows the edge of a cliff. There appears to be no one else around. The sky is dark, however cloud cover obscures the sky.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** Ok, so I think I&#39;ve figured it out. And I&#39;m going to see what&#39;s up there. It&#39;s part of my job, and like, I just know I can do it. It&#39;s hard to explain. I don&#39;t know where I got the conviction from all the sudden, but it&#39;s there now. And I don&#39;t want it to slip away from me.
&gt; 
&gt; //Lin takes a deep breath, and prepares to run toward the edge.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** //[under her breath]// one leap, one leap, one leap...
&gt; 
&gt; //Lin runs toward the cliff edge and jumps. She begins floating upwards.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** One leap, one leap, one leap!
&gt; 
&gt; //Lin&#39;s body flattens out, and she spreads her arms. Her laughter can be heard over the sound of wind against the microphone. After three minutes, Lin enters a cloud.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** Can— can I open my eyes now?
&gt; 
&gt;  //Estimates of Lin&#39;s speed predict that she should have left the cloud cover by this point, however the fog continues. A light can be seen up ahead.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** I can feel the updraft pushing me somewhere. I think I&#39;m flying. I don&#39;t want to look.
&gt; 
&gt; //Lin nears the light, a silhouette can be seen against the light, but its features cannot be distinguished.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** Catherine? Is that you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** Olivia? I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t tell what&#39;s where. I haven&#39;t opened my eyes yet.
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** It&#39;s ok! No need to apologize. Good airwaves.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** Good airwaves!
&gt; 
&gt; //The figure extends its hand.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** Reach out and grab my hand, I&#39;ll pull you up!
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** Got it. 
&gt; 
&gt; //Lin reaches out her hand toward the figure&#39;s. The figure grabs on and appears to pull Lin so they are facing each other. Due to the light behind the figure, no features can be distinguished.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** Your hand feels cold. Are you ok?
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** I&#39;m vibing out. Looks like you&#39;ve found your wings.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** Yeah, I have. I&#39;m still having a hard time wrapping my head around it all.
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** Well, you&#39;re here now my gal.
&gt; 
&gt; //Lin releases the figure&#39;s hand. They both hover in the air.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** You&#39;re doing that thing where you sound like Rainbow again.
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** Oh right. I guess he&#39;s just rubbed off on me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** I have so much I want to say. I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re here as well! I was worried it&#39;d just be me and the clouds.
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** Well, this is the way it turned out. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** It&#39;s almost like a dream. I never want to wake up. We can even follow-through on our weekly coffees.
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** Coffees?
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** Yeah... we said we were going to try to meet up once a week to just talk.
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** Oh right! Sorry, it just slipped my mind.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** You are Olivia, right? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Walsh:** Do you not believe me? 
&gt; 
&gt; //Lin opens her eyes.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Lin:** You— you don&#39;t look like Olivia.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;**End Transcript**&gt;

Researcher Lin&#39;s body was found impaled upon the rocks at the bottom of the Cliffs of Moher. Attempts to locate Rainbow or any other members mentioned in Lin&#39;s previous reports have been unsuccessful. Containment of all individuals associated with OneLeap is considered a Level 4 priority.
