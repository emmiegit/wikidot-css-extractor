+++ Special Containment Procedures

SCP-6070 is located in a modified containment chamber in Site-54. SCP-6070 is coupled with the Site&#39;s fast-neutron nuclear fission reactor&#39;s secondary coolant loop.

If the temperature in SCP-6070&#39;s containment chamber drops below 20 °C, the Site&#39;s reactor thermal output must be increased to compensate. The thermal output required to keep SCP-6070 stable is expected to rise indefinitely. Before the Site-54 reactor reaches its physical limits, a dedicated reactor must be constructed to supply SCP-6070 with enough heat to compensate for the energy loss.
----
+++ Description
SCP-6070 is an experimental anomalous rocket thruster designed for deep space missions. It was invented by Prof. Dr. Steffen Gutenberg for Foundation purposes in 1985. During this time, no anomalous energy source was deemed safe enough to maintain for time periods exceeding short missions within the Kuiper belt. Gutenberg proposed using any non-anomalous energy source and instead employ anomalous equipment to trap exhausted energy in a closed time-loop and reuse it. This constitutes a temporal violation of energy conservation which will lead to a massive loss of energy should the closed time-loop collapse. See provided project documentation for details of controlled wormhole collapse and contingency measures.

The final design, which entered prototyping in 1991, used a flow of ions[[footnote]] A modulated electroosmotic flow through nano-scale tubes that accelerates the engine through turbine exhaust [[/footnote]] through a membrane formed from stabilized threads obtained from [[[SCP-183]]]. The ions enter a wormhole enclosing the membrane, which leads directly into the epicenter of [[[SCP-1950]]].

After four seconds, SCP-1950 reverses time, ejecting the ions back into the engine. All previously exerted forces are now inversely applied to the engine. However, during the four seconds between expelling the ions and them returning, the engine is rotated from the outside, so the reversed force is applied in the same direction.

Energy can be inserted into or removed from this system through a thermal singularity valve (TSV). Heating (cooling) the valve input will increase (decrease) the rate at which the ions are accelerated through the membrane. For safety reasons, the wormhole will collapse after exactly one hundred years. This is believed to be a reasonable time frame to find an external energy source to deal with thermodynamic inconsistencies that will arise from collapsing the temporal violation of energy conservation.

The prototype did not work as expected, however. Despite the engine&#39;s rotation, the exerted force was inversely applied, which was inconsistent with the then leading theories about temporal energy conservation. Testing the prototype was therefore discontinued and SCP-6070 scheduled for decommission.

+++ Decommissioning Proposal Form

**Item #:** Project Sagittarius Engine Prototype
**Object Class:** N/A
**Head Researcher:** Prof. Dr. Steffen Gutenberg

**Decommissioning Rationale:**
The Sagittarius engine prototype is the result of the last eight years of research into rocket propulsion techniques that do not rely on hazardous materials or Keter anomalies to circumvent thermodynamics. We utilize a closed-form wormhole, time inversion and non-anomalous electroosmosis. The wormhole is scheduled to collapse on 17.05.2092, as per Class 1 temporal safety guidelines. However, experiments over the last six months have shown that our theories of temporal energy conservation are most likely wrong, and the current engine iteration does not work. Since the experiments failed, we propose a premature collapse of the wormhole, and standard decommissioning of all materials.

We also request permission to reuse all non-contaminated materials (this is expected to include all materials not required for stabilization of the wormhole) for future prototypes. 

**Special Decommissioning Procedures:**
The Sagittarius device is to be cooled down to -40 °C to sufficiently inhibit electroosmosis and therefore material exchange with the wormhole. Then, the wormhole is to be collapsed during a period in which time in [[[SCP-1950]]] is inverted to inhibit accidental exposure of materials to SCP-1950. As a further safety measure we propose relocating the Sagittarius device to SCP-1950&#39;s containment building to further reduce risk of containment breach.

No further procedures are necessary.

+++ Incident Report SCP-6070/1

**Date of incident:** 27.02.1993
**Item #:** SCP-6070
**Object Class:** Euclid (Preliminary)

**Preliminaries:**
At the time of the incident, SCP-6070 was located in a standard storage container at Site-54. It was classified under the ephemeral designation E-1991-472 (&#34;Sagittarius engine&#34;) and scheduled for decommissioning on the following day. The classification as SCP-6070 was implemented after the incident.

**Incident Report:**
At 09:16, the temperature sensors of SCP-6070 registered a decline in temperature within the device outside expected fluctuations. Since the device was disabled, deemed safe for storage, and scheduled for decommissioning, the incident was logged, but no measures to forward this information to a research team were in place. 

At 10:32, the temperature sensors logged a second event, when the temperature dropped below a threshold differential of 10K when compared to outside temperature. An alarm event was triggered, but equally not forwarded.

At 12:54, the temperature of the storage container and its immediate surroundings had dropped by 5K when compared to surrounding containment facilities. This triggered a monitoring sensor within the storage facility. The sensor reported an unexpected discrepancy of temperature to technical staff, which dispatched a technician to check up on the storage container at 13:01. 

At 13:12, the technician noticed a buildup of frost on the side of SCP-6070&#39;s storage container. The technician reported a potential hazardous material breach to his team and accessed the container documentation to ascertain its contents. Upon realizing that SCP-6070 involved an active temporal violation of energy conservation, the technician triggered a Level 1 breach alarm. Head Researcher Prof. Dr. Gutenberg was informed.

At 13:40, water began to precipitate in the air surrounding the storage container. Temperatures were dropping at an increasing rate and personnel attempting to contain the breach experienced difficulties working for more than a few minutes in the vicinity of the storage container.

At 14:59, space heaters were delivered to the storage facility and technical staff attempted to increase the temperature of the storage container. This measure was moderately effective and slowed down the decline in temperature; however, the environment remained hostile to workers without protective gear. Several pipes in nearby walls burst under the pressure of ice build-up. Water supply could not be maintained in several wings of Site 54. Logistical staff began evacuating storage containers that were deemed at risk. 

Beginning at 15:14, several Mobile Task Forces arrived and started evacuating humanoid SCPs that were jeopardized by the drop in temperature. Biological containment specialists issued a total of 172 emergency alerts due to the failed water supply and declining temperatures in the biological containment wing.

At 16:17, the decision was made to relocate SCP-6070 within its container into the site power plant and to couple it provisionally with one of the cooling loops. 

During the following 7 hours, this decision was implemented. Emergency transports relocated various Keter anomalies to other buildings or shipped them off-site to mitigate further breach events. A crane was ordered from a civilian company for construction equipment using anomalous persuasion techniques and assembled on site. Through a pulley system that was constructed ad-hoc, the container was moved into the reactor building.

At 23:37, this measure was implemented to a sufficient degree and SCP-6070 was heated back to an acceptable temperature. Breach protocols were lifted.

**Item #:** SCP-6070
**Object Class:** Euclid (Preliminary)
**Authors:** Prof. Dr. S. Gutenberg, Dr. H. Bradford, Dr. O. Wu, Researcher J. Kleist

**Summary:**
This report details the findings of our analysis of Incident 6070/1. We propose that the sudden energy drain that destabilized the inner time loop of the Sagittarius device was not caused by a technical malfunction, but by outside manipulation (see Section II &#34;Technical analysis&#34;). Energy was drained from its system and caused a chain reaction that allowed thermal flow through the TSV, which reduced the temperature in the immediate surroundings of the device.

The Sagittarius device in its current state represents a temporal wormhole, i.e., a double-ended tube in time (that is currently forming a closed loop). Since we could disprove manipulation of the device during the last months beyond reasonable doubt (see Section IV &#34;Security analysis&#34;), we assume that the device will be manipulated in the future. That is, from a point in time exactly 100 years in the future (this timescale results from Class 1 temporal safety guidelines). At this time, the temporal wormhole will have collapsed already. That implies that an unknown party has artificially stabilized the temporal wormhole and changed it from a closed loop into an open tunnel. This tunnel connects their present day to our present day with a temporal discrepancy of exactly 100 years (if only theoretically, because the tunnel is still closed at our side, which constitutes a paradox that is not explainable with our current understanding of temporal wormholes).

It is impossible to ascertain who is draining energy from the device in the future, as we cannot foresee what happens to the device within the next 100 years. Further, we are currently unable to state with confidence what modifications to the device allowed a second party to drain energy from the system. While it is certainly possible to cool the device down using the TSV, this valve also prevents accidental energy flow into the device, so it should not be possible to drain energy from our side of the temporal anomaly (see Section III &#34;Temporal considerations&#34;).

Further, we are unsure if decommissioning is possible, because that would directly contradict the existence (and thus the manipulation) of the device in the future (see Section VII &#34;Future work&#34;). Careful experimentation and theoretical analysis is advised.

{{Good morning Steffen,}}

{{I hate to bug you about theoretical temporal studies this early in the morning but ETTRA is bending my ears about it. They don&#39;t like your theory that somebody is draining energy from our reactor into the future and if they had their way, they&#39;d probably immediately dump the entire thing through a one-way portal into hell.}}

{{I&#39;ve talked them down to careful but urgent consideration with the prospect of communication. You&#39;ve described the involved temporals as a double-ended tube, so please tell me that we can somehow talk to the other side. In my experience asking a few questions before shooting is always preferable.}}

{{Can you figure out a way to manipulate the device from our side, so we can somehow message the other side?}}

{{I had already considered that. Obviously, we can send energy to the other side, so technically we can send information. However, we&#39;d need to somehow notify the other side that the information is even there and also hope they figure out how to read it.
We can use a simple, non-encrypted binary code by regularly overheating their system in steady intervals, but even then it would take time for them to notice it, notice a pattern and figure out how to decode it.
And then there is the problem of returning the favor: We do not know if they can send us energy and even if they could: they are draining it anyway, why would they interrupt that process to talk to us?}}

{{Okay sorry for spamming you; technically, for them to send us information doesn&#39;t require sending us energy. They can just modulate how much energy they drain to send us Morse code back by cooling the system down. But still, if the matter is as urgent as ETTRA makes it out to be, I have little hope. It could take months for them to figure out what we want and even then we cannot be sure that they respond.}}

**Project Summary:**
After careful consideration, Director Schönfelde&#39;s proposal to attach a sticky note to SCP-6070 was altered, and an engraved metal plate was affixed to it instead. It contained instructions on how to decode Morse code transmissions sent through the device by purposefully overheating it beginning on 09.03.2093.

The expected baud rate [[footnote]] Signal changes per second [[/footnote]] is rated at 0.0005 Bd. This means on average one byte of information can be transmitted within 4 hours. Faster transmission was deemed impossible because the other side cannot artificially cool down the device. Cooling is reserved for return transmissions through modulating a signal on a steady pulse of overheating and cooling with 0.00025 Bd.

In the afternoon of 09.03.1993 researchers began sending a transmission through the device.

+++ Decommissioning Proposal Form

**Item #:** SCP-6070
**Object Class:** Euclid (preliminary)
**Head Researcher:** Prof. Dr. Steffen Gutenberg

**Decommissioning Rationale:**
SCP-6070 is the now defunct engine prototype of the Sagittarius engine project. Before its scheduled decommission on 28.02.1993, the engine suddenly cooled down, endangering the surrounding facilities. It effectively began to function as a permanent heat sink. We suspended decommissioning and performed extensive analysis to ascertain what was causing the thermodynamic anomaly.

One hundred years from now, an entity (GOI-6070) posing as the Foundation will be draining energy through a temporal tube that was created in the device through as yet unknown means. GOI-6070 claims to require the energy for a feedback-loop, because another entity 200 years from now is also draining energy from the system, and GOI-6070 can no longer satisfy the increasing energy demand using their reactors. GOI-6070 further claims that the energy is looped through the system at least seven times.

Decommissioning SCP-6070 contradicts the events regarding it so far, as well as all events regarding it that will happen in the future. It is believed that decommissioning SCP-6070 will lead to a small-scale reality restructuring event that will retrocausally alter the events of 27.02.1992. Nonetheless, the Department of Temporal Anomalies strongly advises decommissioning SCP-6070, as the predicted reality restructuring is limited in scope and location to Foundation secure facilities. On the contrary, estimated opportunity costs are extremely high, since the predicted energy demand to stabilize SCP-6070 becomes infeasible on 27.02.2093, and will not cease within the next 700 years, necessitating extreme measures to keep up with the device&#39;s energy demand. These measures include, but are not limited to, modifying SCP-6070 to exploit its temporal anomaly to drain energy from the past, which the Department for Temporal Anomalies deems unfavorable compared to the expected local reality restructuring. 

**Special Decommissioning Procedures:**
Refer to previous decommissioning proposal.

**Item #:** SCP-6070
**Object Class:** Keter

**Preliminaries:**
At the time of the incident, SCP-6070 was located at Site 54, awaiting transport to Preliminary Site 1950. SCP-6070 was still coupled to the site&#39;s nuclear reactor cooling system. Technical staff was preparing the device for transport. During the event, SCP-6070 was [[span style=&#34;color: rgb(var(--basalt-negative-color));&#34;]][DATA EXPUNGED][[/span]]

Dear Dr. Gutenberg

I reach out to you to inform you that the Records and Information Security Administration will coopt itself into your SCP-6070 work group. Don&#39;t worry, you will remain in place as the head of research, this is not a disciplinary measure. [[span style=&#34;color: rgb(var(--basalt-negative-color));&#34;]][DATA EXPUNGED][[/span]]

[[span style=&#34;color: rgb(var(--basalt-negative-color));&#34;]][DATA EXPUNGED][[/span]]

[[span style=&#34;color: rgb(var(--basalt-negative-color));&#34;]][DATA EXPUNGED][[/span]] I have expunged all information regarding incident SCP-6070/2 from its file, and I will equally expunge all information about this memo within the SCP-6070 documentation. [[span style=&#34;color: rgb(var(--basalt-negative-color));&#34;]][DATA EXPUNGED][[/span]] I will now ask Overwatch to deal with the anomaly without [[span style=&#34;color: rgb(var(--basalt-negative-color));&#34;]][DATA EXPUNGED][[/span]] and hope they will figure out [[span style=&#34;color: rgb(var(--basalt-negative-color));&#34;]][DATA EXPUNGED][[/span]][[footnote]] SCP-6070 cannot be decommissioned by research staff [[/footnote]].

In the meantime I have granted selected members of your team O4 access to a [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6070/offset/2|new draft iteration]]] of the SCP-6070 file that [[span style=&#34;color: rgb(var(--basalt-negative-color));&#34;]][DATA EXPUNGED][[/span]]

Good luck.
