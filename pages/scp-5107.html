Due to the nature of SCP-5107, direct containment is impossible.

All [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_of_the_Sun public evidence] of SCP-5107 has been confiscated, discredited, or tampered with and is kept within the Site-51 Archive. Due to the efforts of Foundation assets in historic academia, SCP-5107 has been established as a hoax or illusion in the majority of public opinion. This cover will be perpetuated further if necessary.

++++ **__Description__**
SCP-5107 was a phenomenon witnessed by approximately 50,000 people on 1917/10/15, in a field near Fátima, Portugal. At 12:37 GMT for approximately 10 minutes, the sun appeared to move erratically; this was corroborated through photographic evidence and testimony of Foundation agents present. SCP-5107 included an auditory event that analysis revealed to be a conversation in Ecclesiastical Latin, spoken in reverse by unknown entities, designated SCP-5107-A and SCP-5107-B.

++++ **__Discovery__**
Between May and September of 1917, three children named Lucia Santos (9), Jacinta Margo (6), and Francisco Margo (7) gained local renown for their public testimonies of the &#34;Virgin Mary&#34; speaking to them from the sky above Fatima, Portugal. One month prior to SCP-5107, the children stated that the phenomenon would be visible to all in attendance on the date. Approximately 50,000 civilians were in attendance on 1917/10/15, including Foundation Junior Investigative Agents, Thomas Wright and Peter Gladsby. The following audio log was transcribed and translated for ease of access:

**SCP-5107-B:** I just fixed it like, ten epochs ago. It&#39;s fine! 

**SCP-5107-A:** That&#39;s what you said about the kitchen, look how that turned out. Supernova, right in the middle of dinner.

**SCP-5107-B:** That was one time mom! It&#39;s not gonna supernova, just put it back. Geez.

The agents present during SCP-5107 underwent extensive medical and psychological analysis and a large quantity of Compound N78E3 was discovered in their systems. Compound N78E3 is regularly used in the creation of Class-Y Mnestics and is theorized to be the cause of the localized perception of SCP-5107. The source of the Compound N78E3 present was not identified and no further SCP-5107 activity has occurred.
