Heya heya heya! I&#39;m [[*user DarkStuff]], as might be **blindingly** obvious given the CSS and the title. I&#39;ll make this intro short. I have been commissioned by [[*user nosleep]] to make creepypastas at a regular rate. His specifications are that I make them based on singular mainlist SCPs, and that they can work as standalone articles. They&#39;re for his YouTube Channel, [*https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQHD4P6lZNNt8vzfHlIOoXg Dr. SCP], for him and his team to add narration, animation, and sound to. To be transparent, it&#39;s not content //I// would consume, but what do I care? It&#39;s giving me a great reason to write weekly spooOOOOoooky stories, and I am having a //ton// of fun with it.

So really, there isn&#39;t anything else to say here. This is obviously where I am going to collect them all, so that someone who wants to read my creepypastas can use this hub to find them. Due to the (ahem, //ostensibly//) weekly nature of this arrangement, expect this hub to grow //rather fast.// As long as this arrangement holds up, this is eventually going to become a pretty large part of my authorship.

&gt; __Note from the Future:__ This well ran dry, so this is as big as this hub is getting! Still an interesting little thing that happened, and it yielded this fun branded CSS I&#39;ll be sure to put to use somewhere in the future. It&#39;s stylish! Okay, now. Ciao!

Soooo... here you are! In reverse chronological order:

* [[[Making Weight]]]
* [[[The Grown-Up]]]
* [[[The Mind as a Canopic Jar]]]
* [[[Baby Don&#39;t Hurt Me|Get a Room]]]
* [[[Tube Slides]]]
* [[[Say Cheese]]]
* [[[Smoking on Company Time]]]
* [[[Online Dating]]]
* [[[The Smell of Cellulose]]]
