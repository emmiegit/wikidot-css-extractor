**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6113-3 has escaped containment, assisted by SCP-6113-1 and presumably Dr. James Park[[footnote]]See Addendum 6113-3.20: Containment Breach 6113-3 15/11/2019.[[/footnote]]. Mobile Task Force Lambda-69 (&#34;Six-Color Crusaders&#34;) is to locate SCP-6113-3 and bring her into containment where she will be held until the age of 18 in 2025. If such a time passes without recontainment, she is instead to be located and given Class C and G amnestics. Dr. James Park is to be terminated as soon as possible.

Amnesticization and planting of false memories in SCP-6113-3 to remove any knowledge of Dr. James Park pending Ethics Committee approval.

As of writing, SCP-6113-3 and Dr. James Park have not been located.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
= **Containment Breach Report**
-----
**Date:** 15/11/2019
**Site:** 17
**SCP(s) Involved:** SCP-6113-1, SCP-6113-3
**MTF(s) Involved:** Lambda-69 (&#34;Six-Color Crusaders&#34;)
**Personnel Involved:** Various Site-17 security personnel, Dr. Brandon Fisher
**Other(s) Involved:** Dr. James Park (presumably)
----
On 15/11/2019, at 10:26 PM, SCP-6113-1 appeared unnoticed in an unpopulated portion of Site-17, disguised as Site Director Thomas Graham. SCP-6113-1 made its way to Dr. Brandon Fisher&#39;s office, mimicing his behavior perfectly so as to remain undetected.

Still disguised, SCP-6113-1 then requested Dr. Fisher&#39;s Level 3 Access Card for &#34;security purposes.&#34; Despite the suspect reasoning, Dr. Fisher granted SCP-6113-1 his Access Card before returning to his terminal. SCP-6113-1 then left Dr. Fisher&#39;s office and walked towards the Low-Security Humanoid Containment wing. When alone, SCP-6113-1 took the opportunity to disguise as Dr. Fisher. This was captured on surveillance cameras, and security personnel were alerted.

At 11:03 PM, a full site lockdown was ordered by Site Director Graham. Mobile Task Force Lambda-69 (&#34;Six-Color Crusaders&#34;) was deployed, with an ETA of approximately 10 minutes. SCP-6113-1, still disguised, arrived in the humanoid containment wing and requested to meet with SCP-6113-3. Approximately half of the guards stationed in this wing were absent, attending to the lockdown order. Again, despite the suspicious circumstances, the guard allowed SCP-6113-1 into SCP-6113-3&#39;s containment cell. This was captured on surveillance cameras.

Upon entrance, SCP-6113-3 reacted with alarm and anger, shouting several expletives. SCP-6113-1 then disappeared for a few moments before returning with a woman, presumably Dr. James Park. SCP-6113-3 was shocked, yet calmed immediately. The following exchange is logged below:

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**SCP-6113-3:** James...?

**Dr. Park:** It&#39;s... Janet now.

**SCP-6113-3:** Holy fucking shit, your egg cracked!

**Dr. Park:** No thanks to you. &lt;smiles&gt;

= //&lt;SCP-6113-3 runs up and hugs Dr. Park.&gt;//

**SCP-6113-3:** I missed you so much, dickhead.

= //&lt;Dr. Park hugs her tightly.&gt;//

**Dr. Park:** I missed you, too... dipshit.

**SCP-6113-3:** Ha! Finally got you to curse at me!

= //&lt;Dr. Park giggles.&gt;//

**SCP-6113-3:** So, what&#39;s the plan?

**Dr. Park:** We break out with -1&#39;s help.

**SCP-6113-3:** Then?

**Dr. Park:** ...For once in my life, I&#39;ve got nothing planned after that.

= //&lt;SCP-6113-3 grabs Dr. Park&#39;s hand.&gt;//

**SCP-6113-3:** Well, lead the way.
[[/div]]

SCP-6113-3 and Dr. James Park both left two documents and three labeled photos on the containment cell&#39;s desk. The group left the containment cell as security personnel approached their position. SCP-6113-1, SCP-6113-3, and Dr. James Park then sprinted in the opposite direction.

At 11:12 PM, MTF Lambda-69 arrived in the humanoid containment wing, in front of the group. MTF Lambda-69 engaged the group, firing non-lethal ammunition. All projectiles, however, harmlessly collided with their bodies. SCP-6113-3 and Dr. James Park exhibited no pain response. One member of MTF Lambda-69 then vocalized several thaumaturgical incantations in an attempt to disable SCP-6113-1&#39;s known abilities. These incantations were only successful in removing SCP-6113-1&#39;s ability to disguise, revealing its true orange light form. With SCP-6113-1&#39;s assistance, the group disappeared from view.

At 11:15 PM, Site-17&#39;s lockdown order was lifted, and search efforts for SCP-6113-1, SCP-6113-3, and Dr. James Park were initiated for all Foundation agents and applicable Mobile Task Forces within a 100 km radius. At 4:00 AM, the search order was lifted.

I am thankful for my time with the Foundation, and I have enjoyed working on the SCP-6113 project immensely. However, I cannot, in good conscience, continue my employment. The reason: SCP-6113-3. It was envy, she said. That the idea of being a girl for her was more desirable than actually being a boy. I didn&#39;t understand it at the time. Needless to say, my desire to be her mother shadowed my judgement. For the better.
@@ @@
I know I&#39;ve been compromised. You will search for and attempt to terminate me. For once, I don&#39;t care. I love her and I will do anything to protect her. That includes what I&#39;ve just done. Forgive me, but I did what I thought was necessary. What I thought was &#34;ethical.&#34;

I expect to see you soon. And, again, thank you, truly, for the opportunity.

Dear Foundation,

Dare I say it, but maybe taking a little abused trans girl hostage wasn&#39;t the best decision you&#39;ve ever made. Sure, life could&#39;ve been worse for me, but it could&#39;ve also been better. Who knows? You never even gave me the chance. I know one thing for certain, though. I never had a family and the Foundation couldn&#39;t give me one. Wouldn&#39;t even let me have one. So I had to find my own. Janet.

Don&#39;t try looking for me and her. Ya&#39;ll may be all powerful, but I have an invincible spirit thing protecting me. And, don&#39;t you dare touch Alena again. Or I swear to god, I&#39;ll make ya&#39;ll bleed.

There isn&#39;t much more for me to say other than that. Of course, with love, fuck you.
