**Special Containment Procedures:** All activities and buildings related to the storage, creation, or use of landmines, plastic explosives weighing less than two kilograms, and other small conventional explosives (Including, but not limited to; Tannerite, Thermite, Semtex) are to be monitored by the SCP Foundation for SCP-5023 events. If an event is confirmed to have happened or is currently ongoing, Mobile Task Force Sigma-301 (&#34;Rainy Day&#34;) should be deployed to the location to protect bystanders, provide emergency services, and disarm any active explosives if possible.

**Description:** SCP-5023 is a phenomenon that occurs when 6 or more humans are within 100 meters of a large supply of explosives, causing all subjects to engage in an extremely dangerous game of &#34;Ultimate Frisbee.&#34; No participants will be harmed during the proceedings, but structures and objects will be damaged or destroyed as normal.

The events that occur during an SCP-5023 event are consistent across all documented cases and are presented below.

&gt; # Personnel will stop working and begin to talk amongst themselves, even if doing so is potentially dangerous.
&gt; # A man with a tank top and muscular build[[footnote]]Designated SCP-5023-A[[/footnote]] and a woman with a lacerated and bleeding foot[[footnote]]Designated SCP-5023-B[[/footnote]] will approach the subjects and ask if they would like to play Ultimate Frisbee. Despite the odd appearance of the two entities, most subjects will agree.[[footnote]]Contrary to some similar anomalies, subjects suffer no compulsion to engage with the entities.[[/footnote]]
&gt; # SCP-5023-B will begin to explain the rules to the subjects while SCP-5023-A will begin to clear an area and shape the explosives by hand. SCP-5023-B will then offer the subjects a wrist band in the colors red or blue.[[footnote]]This is the last point that a participant can safely opt-out.[[/footnote]]
&gt; # The game will commence and be played until the supply of explosives is depleted.

Participants are largely immune to physical damage during the game, believed to be a by-product of the bracelet. Attempts to recover a bracelet for testing have failed. Both SCP-5023-A and -B have evaded Foundation capture but provided a single interview in 2012.

&gt; Interview conducted by Doctor Alexandra Virgil via drone.

&gt; 
&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-5023-B can be seen shouting across the field outside of a munitions factory in [REDACTED].]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5023-B:** Get some water! You&#39;ve been playing hard! 
&gt; 
&gt; //[A man can be seen holding a landmine while another man throws punches at it in a manner similar to a boxing coach and a boxer. The second man makes contact, detonating the mine and launching the pair an unknown distance apart. Both sit up and begin laughing.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5023-B:** Alright. You a new player? Love me some robots.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Virgil:** No? This is a remote-controlled //drone//, not a real robot.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5023-A:** //[Off-Screen.]// Hey, don&#39;t talk about yourself like that. Obstacles only exist in your mind, brother. Pump some iron and make it real.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Virgil:** Are... Is that a joke?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5023-B:** No jokes here, Robrother. We&#39;re all about self-improvement. He&#39;s getting ready for the Olympics and I&#39;m learning to firewalk. All mind over matter.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Virgil:** I&#39;m not gonna touch that. Okay. Why are you playing Ultimate Frisbee with highly dangerous explosives?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5023-A:** It&#39;s all about satisfying the most primal of human urges. //[Pause.]// Sorry if the human bit is insensitive. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Virgil:** You&#39;re, nevermind. When you say, &#34;most primal of human urges,&#34; do you mean adrenaline? A sense of danger?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5023-B:** Nah, man. We&#39;re no strangers to extreme sports and all, but we mean the human need to play Ultimate.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Virgil:** The what.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5023-A:** You know, when you pick up anything circulastic or round and you just feel like you gotta throw it like a frisbee? That.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Virgil:** Okay, but why explosives? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5023-B:** Flying is great. //[Pause.]// I don&#39;t wanna cut this short, but we should get back to it. My buddy sent me a new frisbee I can&#39;t wait to try out.
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-5023 can be seen withdrawing a [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4451 modified Roomba vacuum cleaner] from its bag.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5023-B:** Special edition for DC. Pretty neat, huh? Hey, catch!
