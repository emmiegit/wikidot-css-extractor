The Beast of Wernorad
[[/cell]]
[[cell]]
A chimera created by the Daevite Empire from the body of a desert wyvern and the soul of the rage of Daevite warriors. Intended as the ultimate weapon against the forces of Grand Karcist Ion, it was created as a being that would exist outside of life and death, in hopes that this state would render Ion&#39;s carnomancy useless against it. Despite its orders, the resulting monster turned against its masters and slaughtered the city of Daevon, entering a deep sleep within its ruins, only to be uncovered by the SCP Foundation and classified as SCP-682 millennia later. Due to its status as a being outside the cycle of life and death, despises every living creature.

++ The O5 Council

In From 120&#39;s Archives, the SCP Foundation was formed from thirteen different prenormalcy and occult organizations from around the globe. Their leaders mostly became the original O5 Council. However, during the Fae attack on Site-01 in 1911, a large portion of the original O5 Council died. Due to this, the below tables show two versions of the Council: the original one, and the one re-staffed following the Factory raid. Due to the borderline immortality achieved by the whole Council via various anomalous means, its members are mostly immune to aging and therefore only get removed by murder.
