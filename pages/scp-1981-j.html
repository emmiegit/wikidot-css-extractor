**Item #:**  SCP-1981-J

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Containment Procedures:** SCP-1981-J-1 is to be kept in a lonely world.  Once per week, it is to be escorted by a contingent of agents from MTF Eta-10 (Perry’s Pipers) onto the midnight train going anywhere.[[footnote]]Provided that the destination has a Foundation facility nearby.[[/footnote]]  SCP-1981-J-2 is to be contained in South Detroit, where it was born and raised.  It is also to be escorted by MTF Eta-10 onto the midnight train going anywhere.  No contact is to be allowed between SCP-1981-J-1 and -2 until they arrive at their destination.

Once SCP-1981-J-1 and -2 arrive at their destination, they are to be kept in a smoky room, which contains a singer, the smell of wine and cheap perfume.  Should SCP-1981-J-1 smile at SCP-1981-J-2, or vice-versa, after 6 PM, ESCAPE Protocol is to be enacted immediately.[[footnote]]Protocol kept separate from this document for brevity; it goes on and on and on and on.[[/footnote]]

**Description:** SCP-1981-J consists of two shadows, searching in the night.  They were discovered up and down the boulevard in ███████, Ontario, by strangers who had been waiting for the bus.  SCP-1981-J are predatory metamorphic organisms, capable of altering their forms at will; however, they both have forms which are highly preferred.  SCP-1981-J-1 most commonly takes the form of streetlights, while SCP-1981-J-2 prefers the form of people.  It is currently unknown if SCP-1981-J are alive; they are able to communicate, and their metamorphic abilities allow for facial expressions and body language, but they posses no vital signs, and are unwilling to cooperate in experiments.  Current theories suggest that SCP-1981-J are living just to find emotion.  Interviews with witnesses to SCP-1981-J&#39;s capture suggested that there were additional instances hiding somewhere in the night; MTF Eta-10 is on the lookout, --but has not found any evidence to suggest this.-- See Incident 1981-J-A.

&gt; **Eta-10 Lead:** Alright boys, work hard out there tonight.  There&#39;s at least two of these things out there, and I&#39;ve got my fill of chasing anomalies around the city.
&gt; 
&gt; **Eta-10-5:** I don&#39;t really care what happens.  I just want a thrill.
&gt; 
&gt; **Eta-10-7:** Me too.
&gt; 
&gt; **Eta-10-6:** Me three!
&gt; 
&gt; **Eta-10-3:** Shut up, Probies.
&gt; 
&gt; **Eta-10 Lead:** Let&#39;s split up, team.  Three, Five, and Six, with me.  Two, Four, and Seven, you go down the boulevard.
&gt; 
&gt; **Eta-10-2:**  Copy, boss.  Time to roll the dice, just one more time.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1981-J-1:** Some will win.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1981-J-2:** Some will lose.[[footnote]]It is currently unknown if these statements were predictions of the future or simple threats.  However, it has since been discovered that some were in fact born to sing the blues.[[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **Eta-10-5:** W-what was that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Eta-10 Lead:** Seems like they came to us.  Alright, remain calm, and follow the plan.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1981-J:** (//simultaneously//) The movie never ends!!!
&gt; 
&gt; **Eta-10 Lead:** Floodlights on!
&gt; 
&gt; **Eta-10-2:** And On!
&gt; 
&gt; **Eta-10-3:** And On!
&gt; 
&gt; **Eta-10-4:** And On!
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-1981-J screeches and hisses//
&gt; 
&gt; **Eta-10 Lead:** Don&#39;t stop!
&gt; 
&gt; **Eta-10-6:** I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s working!
&gt; 
&gt; //A blast of wind originating from SCP-1981-J hits MTF Eta-10, pushing several members into and up the wall.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Eta-10-2:** Five, hold on to that ceiling! I&#39;m coming for you!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1981-J:** Streetlights!  People!
&gt; 
&gt; **Eta-10-5:** I can&#39;t hold on!
&gt; 
&gt; **Eta-10-2:** Don&#39;t stop!

**Incident SCP-1981-J-A:** On May 19 2009, numerous instances of SCP-1981-J were discovered on the set of the television show ████, resulting in █ fatalities before containment could be enacted.  Due to the publicity surrounding the show, amnestics were distributed to the surviving cast, and Agents Morrison and Lynch were inserted to replace actors slain by SCP-1981-J.  Upgrade to Keter is pending approval.

//Note from Agent Morrison: Please get me out of here.  A man can only listen to so much a cappella.//</textarea></pre>
