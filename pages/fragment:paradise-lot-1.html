++++ INT. NEO-HASKELL GENETIC RESEARCH FACILITY/LAB 4Y - NIGHT
It&#39;s cold and dark and empty at the facility; the sole exception is Lab 4Y. Machines whirr as the room is illuminated by a single, dismal, blue lamp.

Click. Click. A miniscule piece of amber crystal is placed into a circular holder by a robotic appendage. Lowers down.

A figure stands on the other side of a tempered glass window watching the experiment unfold. 

The crystal is struck by a laser, pulsates, then violently explodes. 

Shades of orange and red bathe the lab and dance off of the figure&#39;s glasses.

They smile.

++++ EXT. UNCHARTED SECTOR OF THE HAIDURK GALAXY - SPACE
[[size 115%]]**SUPER:** HAIDURK SYSTEM, 1999[[/size]]

Stars dot the emptiness of the void; the only relief is a spaceship the size of a large yacht drifting aimlessly. Its black exterior makes it blend into its surroundings, making obvious the red embossed letters on the side reading &#39;PARADISE&#39;.

++++ INT. STARSHIP PARADISE/LIVING QUARTERS - SPACE

The room is, to put it bluntly, a real mess. Various effects and tchotchkes are strewn around the quarters, a four-person space haphazardly redressed as a miniature living space. There&#39;s only one chair; a malleable ugly amorphous blob of a beanbag. A cracked full-body mirror hangs on to the wall via duct tape. 

By a large port window on the far side of the room lays a bed— on top of that bed lies EKATERINA LOT: a slightly stocky yet lithe woman in her mid twenties. Her carnelian-colored hair is ruffled, barely resembling her usual long inverted bob.

She rubs her eyes before attempting to de-wrinkle her oversized tank top and ill-fitting pants. The voice of K, Lot&#39;s work contact, emanates from a phone-like panel nearby the beanbag.

&gt; Dear AnAnomalousWriter:
&gt;
&gt; I deeply apologize for the fact that the second half as you are seeing it is currently severely unfinished. The formatting of it has proven to be very, very challenging and due to circumstances regarding how I write I severely underestimated the length of time it would take to complete the CSS. That being said, I am working on it diligently and will update this page when I can with the rest of the article. I have also included a rough numbered version of the plot should you want to finish the story before I am able to finish the rest. Again, I deeply apologize for giving you what is essentially a pot with no handles. It was not my intention and I hope you will enjoy what there is so far.
&gt; 
&gt; Happy Holidays,

# --[ALT LOCATION] A man watches through glass as a beam of light is fired into a tiny piece of crystal, which explodes violently on contact. He smiles as fire flickers in the reflection of his glasses.--
# --Lot receives a contract from K to retrieve a special type of crystal being researched by a Dr. Hakamoto--
# Takes the //Paradise// to the city-state of Neo-Haskell at planet Tadalos and leaves her ship in an assigned docking bay to procure supplies and money
# Tries to withdraw funds at a bank but gets involved in a robbery; she attempt to stop it by holding a robber hostage to make the others stand down (it doesn’t work, the other robber shoots his partner) but has to resort to her skill and combat
# Outside the bank she (briefly) reunites with Aurelion Comparri - a former Academy classmate and MARPAT operator - and gets a little more info on the workings of Neo-Haskell. Gives a quick testimony about the robbery and is cleared to go. Also runs into a young boy there.
# Arrives later at the Neo-Haskell Genetic Research Facility (NHGRF) and has some trouble getting in; Dr. Hakamoto’s assistant Freyja Wehrner welcomes her and introduces them to the young twins visiting in the lobby - the girl Sara and the boy at the bank, Michael. Lot also learns about the NHGRF&#39;s purpose and the use of nanobots in the Cognitive Division, led by Hakamoto.
# Lot waits in the lobby for Hakamoto and Freyja to finish up the last procedures on the crystal for transport. Some Security Force personnel - including Colonel Robertson - visit the facility to determine the state of research before it’s suspended, but are turned away as well. Lot gets a little impatient and heads to the Cognitive Division herself.
# She witnesses a member of the team order some particularly dressed men to shoot the rest of the researchers and leaves with the crystal and machinery. Checks on Freyja and Haskell - both unquestionably dead. Lot manages to escape as a bomb goes off, destroying most of the evidence.
# Makes it back to the Paradise and catches a bit of the broadcast of the ATMOS-7 launch, a direct beam energy defense satellite. News briefly touches on the explosion at NHGRF as well. Conks out for the night.
# [ALT LOCATION] An officer notifies Colonel Robertson that they believe the explosion wasn’t an accident: traces of gunshots, missing equipment, and a picture of Lot. He tells the officer to keep him updated on the case and to track her down.
# Reviews footage from her ocular implant to determine who the culprit was, but the shot is too blurry for her to fully identify the ‘killer’. She goes out to the city to identify the man.
# Lot reads a newspaper in a café with the list of victims to cross-reference, but some don’t have images, leaving her with an incomplete check. Also notes the children are only considered missing. Comparri comes by and says hello briefly, as well as giving her his number and telling her to call ASAP as his shift is up.
# “montage” of her going to several places (newspapers, libraries, etc.) to find the rest of the image portraits. Lot doesn’t notice a figure dressed in sunglasses and coat tailing her while she does all of this.
# [ALT LOCATION] A shady man makes some phone calls in his condo… which is filled with tons of machinery and papers. Sara and Michael lay unmoving in the setup, but he starts to stir a little.
# Lot calls Comparri at the end of his shift, and he asks her to meet him at the police station by the MARPAT sector and to come less overtly. He tells her about an ‘outstanding persons’ notice handed down from somewhere in the govt. to the main police station, warning her that she’ll get detained if she’s too rowdy and for her to keep low.
# Witnesses over internal police cams an attempted bombing and attack on Col. Robertson that the MARPAT assists in stopping. Lot notes that they were carrying expensive state-of-the-art weaponry despite being ‘terrorists’. Robertson has the surviving terrorists dumped with the rest of the bodies.
# She borrows Comparri’s ID to check the police database on the incident and manages to positively ID the doctor as Dr. Van Neuytens. She tells Comparri that he’s the culprit - he responds by saying he’ll check it out with some help. Lot thanks him and promises to give him a date in return.
# Heads to Dr. Van Neuytens’s last listed address and manages to enter his apartment (the same from the alt loc. with the kids). Sees the figure from before wearing a coat and sunglasses running out from the fire escape - Lot gives chase.
# Gets lost in the crowd after some police mistakenly think she’s a criminal, causing her to shoot her gun in the air to disperse them. Gets a good grab on the figure, but they manages to escape. Shoots at them and ‘misses’ their leg.
# Lot decides to lay low due to her outstanding notice and tucks into a nearby hotel to stakeout Van Neuytens’s apartment and to rest, takes a shower too
# Hears noises during her shower, realizes that it’s someone in the room. Checks it out - it’s Michael. He escaped from Dr. Van Neuytens’s apartment, saw Lot again and knew she could help from her performance at the bank. He doesn’t want to go to the police because he says that someone there is working with Van Neuytens. He also explains that he is an esper, a person with anomalously high mental energy and other effects.
# She tends to Michael (even though she claims she’s not a babysitter) and has him accompany her while she investigates. Lot tries to go back to the //Paradise// to access her uplink and other supplies, but there are men waiting there in ambush. Lot fights them off with the help of Michael’s powers.
# Aboard the //Paradise//, Lot reloads on ammo, contacts K and asks for a week extension, and runs one or two tests on Michael.
# An explosion in the far side of the city rocks the ground. Lot immediately checks in on the television to catch any news on it: it was a bomb created from tiny fragments of crystal and blew up the entirety of Van Neuytens’s apartment building. The pictures of both him and Lot are circulated as suspects in the case.
# [ALT LOCATION] Van Neuytens sits in an unknown office and watches the tv. He laughs at the performance of the bomb.
# Lot notices the presence of some unusually-dressed Armament &amp; Security Technologies Corp. (ASTC) workers, the same ones that assisted Van Neuytens during his robbery of the NHGRF. She theorizes that he sold his research members out in order for a higher cut from the corporate company.
# Lot takes Michael and leaves the //Paradise//, realizing that since she is being actively hunted she cannot stay in the ship docks for long. She calls Comparri and organizes a meeting for information in a nightclub where she can blend in.
# At the meeting, she trades theories and investigations with Comparri. He explains that Von Neuytens is connected to ATSC, and that ATSC is the company behind the production of the ATMOS-type sats. Plainclothes Security Force members arrest Lot and detain Comparri, but Lot stalls long enough for Michael to escape notice by the forces. He promises to find her once she gets out.
# [ALT LOCATION] Michael is abducted by the figure Lot was chasing and fought earlier, and takes him into a car.
# Lot is transferred in custody to the head government building, and asked politely to help the government in recovering the crystal and additional research taken from NHGRF. She is told to talk to Colonel Robertson and to work with him.
# She is introduced to the Colonel formally and he gives her an ultimatum to be completely subservient to his orders on the crystal or face getting Comparri executed. She becomes aware that the Security Force does not know the whole deal with the research project and declines to tell the Colonel about the rest, not trusting him.
# Lot is put undercover at an ATSC facility that Van Neuytens was seen by. She locates the crystal and the hidden machinery that night and radioes it in to the Security Force, but is interrupted by the shadowy figure from before. Michael is also in tow. Lot compliments the figure - who she finally recognizes to be Frejya - on her tenacity for staying alive and trying to protect the children. She relents working alone and tells Lot that the two twins are actually her own children.
# [ALT LOCATION] Security Force units surround the ATSC Facility.
# Van Neuytens confronts the two and also demonstrates the power of the crystals by blowing up a large strip of desert (think NUCLEAR bombs) into oblivion using ATMOS-7. He holds Sara at knifepoint and threatens the two to back off. He explains that the crystals aren&#39;t really anomalous, but due to the research they had done: by using strong espers&#39; powers on the crystal, it imprints the excess energy onto the crystal and turns it permanently into a volatile superweapon. The team stumbled upon it accidentally and Hakamoto wanted to make sure the research was used for peace, but Van Neuytens realized he could sell it to the highest bidder and organized the deaths of his colleagues.
# Col. Robertson arrives; Van Neuytens reveals he has been dealing tech to the colonel and expects a full pardon from the government and for Lot and Freyja to be killed. However, Robertson turns on Van Neyutens after he inadvertently reveals that the crystal process can be reverse-engineered and automated without his knowledge.
# The colonel kills Van Neuytens, and takes Sara hostage again. Having heard the doctor&#39;s explanations, he says he will either take the two children or just Freyja, as she was a more powerful esper than her children. He plans to use it/her to create a powerful military, citing the current government as weak and appeasing. Robertson’s undercover ATSC men attempt to kill Lot to cover up the incident completely.
# Lot manages to recover Sara and finds Michael hiding, completely reuniting the twins. Robertson activates ATMOS-7 to fire on the governmental district of Neo-Haskell. He uses this to threaten Lot, who is hiding with the children; she walks out and sees Freyja being held hostage in front of the colonel.
# The colonel initially brags about his plans succeeding and taunts Lot before being shot by her through Freyja. Through clues given to her, she had realized that Freyja did indeed die at NHGRF, and that she had been using her latent esper powers to assemble the nanobots used at the facility into a form long enough for her to find her children - thus making her immune to most physical-based attacks.
# Robertson dies and sets off the ATMOS-7’s fire procedure. Lot rushes to the docks to get to the //Paradise// in order to shoot down the satellite before it fires. Sara and Michael stay in the ATSC facility with Freyja fending off the other Robertson-allied troops with help from the Security Force. Lot climbs in the mini-cruiser module and takes off.
# She gets the coordinates for the satellite from Freyja and ignores being shot at by more of Robertson&#39;s men to destroy the satellite. Lot does so, critically getting ATMOS-7 to not fire at the cost of blowing up her mini-cruiser and almost fatally injuring herself. Freyja uses the last of her power in conjunction with the twins to bring Lot back from death and “teleporting” her back into the ATSC facility.
# Lot wakes up and cracks a fucking joke. Wonderful lady.
# (TIMESKIP) Lot recovers (she&#39;s cyborg after all) and delivers the crystal at a drop point and is paid, fully knowing that the crystal as-is isn’t the real anomaly and will therefore be useless to the FSP to weaponize. She also takes on Sara and Michael until she can find someone to raise them, unwilling to let them become completely orphaned and stranded on Tadalos. They go on the //Paradise// and launch off into the cosmos, waiting for the next contract.
