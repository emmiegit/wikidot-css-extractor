//This is Zachary Rainer--//
[[/&lt;]]

[[&gt;]]
//--and Lauren Jeane.//
[[/&gt;]]

[[&lt;]]
//... and Lauren Jeane. And this will be the... final? (Pausing) Final, journal log.//

//Should we should try and keep things nice and short?//
[[/&lt;]]

[[&gt;]]
//Well, I mean -- sure. You&#39;re the one who wanted to make this after all.//
[[/&gt;]]

[[=]]
//(Rs. Rainer chuckles.)//
[[/=]]

[[&lt;]]
//You&#39;re right. I did.//
[[/&lt;]]

[[=]]
//(Silence for 15 seconds.)//
[[/=]]

[[&lt;]]
//It&#39;s been almost 30 days since we resurfaced from diving. Since then, we have lost all but 3 personnel. This, of course, doesn&#39;t include the previous Dr. Kaiden Sinclair, who we later realized was not the actual doctor.//

//Do you want to explain this part, Lauren?//
[[/&lt;]]

[[&gt;]]
//Uh, sure.//

//After some investigation into Dr. Kaiden Sinclair and the &#34;Project &#39;PARASYTE&#39;&#34; precursor study held before Project 303-13, we eventually learned that he had been compromised by a parasitic anomaly. This parasite was able to then transfer itself into the Noosphere along with the rest of us -- presumably infecting it and the rest of all human perception.//
[[/&gt;]]

[[&lt;]]
//With the obvious exception for us. Even though we still don&#39;t necessarily know why, yet.//
[[/&lt;]]

[[&gt;]]
//We&#39;ll need to spend some more time later trying to piece it all together.//
[[/&gt;]]

[[=]]
//(More silence.)//
[[/=]]

[[&gt;]]
//That isn&#39;t everything you wanted to say, is it?//
[[/&gt;]]

[[&lt;]]
//Unless you wanted to mention the little thing we have going, maybe.//
[[/&lt;]]

[[&gt;]]
//Zach. Not now, please. There are more important things we need to worry about.//
[[/&gt;]]

[[=]]
//(It goes silent once more.)//
[[/=]]

[[&lt;]]
//We can, uh, we can discuss that later then.//
[[/&lt;]]

[[=]]
//(He clears his throat)//
[[/=]]
 
[[&lt;]]
//I could talk about how all of the anomalies that surrounded us before are gone. Completely vanished, I mean. Our best guess is that Dr. Sinclair was the primary anomaly, and wasn&#39;t able to transfer himself to another host before dying.//
[[/&lt;]]

[[=]]
//(Dr. Jeane vocalizes in the affirmative.)//
[[/=]]

[[&lt;]]
//Which means our next task will be turning things back to normal.//
[[/&lt;]]

[[&gt;]]
//Hopefully there&#39;s a solution that doesn&#39;t turn us into lab rats or corpses as soon as we return things back to the way they were. If that&#39;s even possible at this point?//
[[/&gt;]]

[[&lt;]]
//There is. We&#39;ll just need to explore our options.//
[[/&lt;]]

[[&gt;]]
//You make it sound so easy Zach.//
[[/&gt;]]

[[&lt;]]
//Well it&#39;s not exactly rocket science.//
[[/&lt;]]

[[&gt;]]
//What are our options then? For making things go back to normal?//
[[/&gt;]]

[[&lt;]]
//We can try to live things out and hope for the best.//

//Or we could jump ship -- find some anomaly that can take us back in time, switch realities, anything really. The world&#39;s our oyster.//
[[/&lt;]]

[[&gt;]]
//Have you talked to Aaron about it?//
[[/&gt;]]

[[&lt;]]
//It wouldn&#39;t matter if I did, would it? Not like we have any other things to do here.//
[[/&lt;]]

[[&gt;]]
//So, that&#39;s the plan then?//
[[/&gt;]]

[[&lt;]]
//It&#39;s all we need.//
[[/&lt;]]

[[=]]
//(Pause)//
[[/=]]

[[&gt;]]
//Should we go ahead and end this here then? Not like it has much of a point anymore.//
[[/&gt;]]

[[=]]
//(He chuckles.)//
[[/=]]

[[&lt;]]
//Right. Yeah, we&#39;ll end this here. Just don&#39;t let me forget to tell you about this idea that I&#39;ve been having for the three of us.//
