&#34;Barbara! ... Barbara, where are you?&#34;

Kenneth was getting desperate. He was afraid he&#39;d have to go back to the trailer and fetch a better flashlight, but the thought of poor Barbara in trouble made him press frantically further into the bush.

-----

The sun was just about setting when he&#39;d decided he would swing by Barbara&#39;s for a visit tonight. A few late errands in town, and he was pulling up the driveway not too long after dusk. 

&#34;Honey,&#34; Kenneth had called out as he made his way up the porch steps. &#34;I brought by a bundle &#39;a firewood for ya, and since...&#34;

His sentence trailed off as he noticed the front door unlatched, flapping open and shut in the wind. That wasn&#39;t like her, not in this cool fall weather. Instantly he&#39;d felt a knot in his stomach.

-----

Now, after what felt like an eternity of scouring the woods under a cloudy night sky, he still kept casting a dim ray of light around the ferns and trees. The beam fell on something that contrasted the abundant woody foliage - a mane of matted and dirty, but golden blonde hair.

//&#34;Barbara!&#34;//

Kenneth rushed over and fell to his knees beside her. &#34;Oh no. No, no, no...&#34;

Barbara lay battered and bruised. Blood and dirt seemed smeared all over from different sorts of cuts and scratches. Her eyes fluttered open as Kenneth laid a hand on her arm. &#34;Mmhhh... is that..?&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s me,&#34; Kenneth said softly. &#34;Come on, we got &#39;ta get you outta here.&#34;

**. . .**

With her weight on his shoulder, Barbara and Kenneth slowly trudged back out of the woods.

&#34;What in the world happened?&#34; Kenneth asked. 

&#34;Please,&#34; Barbara sniffled. &#34;Please, I don&#39;t want to talk about it.&#34;

&#34;Fine, fine,&#34; Kenneth consoled her. &#34;That&#39;s okay.&#34;

They shuffled on in silence for a minute. Barbara&#39;s foot slipped on some fallen leaves and they stumbled. 

&#34;S-sorry...&#34;

&#34;Don&#39;t you be saying that,&#34; Kenneth said back. &#34;I&#39;ll be making sorry the one who did this...&#34; He turned his head toward her. &#34;You will tell me that, won&#39;t you?&#34;

Barbara&#39;s eyes fluttered as she avoided his gaze. &#34;Kenneth, I don&#39;t want-&#34;

&#34;Has Andrew been coming around again; that raggedy bastard.&#34;

&#34;-maybe later, just not now-&#34;

&#34;Is Joseph back from his tour of duty; did he...&#34;

&#34;Kenneth, I said not now! Please...&#34; Barbara seemed to nearly faint from the effort of raising her voice.

&#34;Okay, it&#39;s okay...&#34; Kenneth heaved, stepped forward, and kept them moving. &#34;Home is just up ahead.&#34;

&#34;But I don&#39;t see it,&#34; Barbara groaned. &#34;My sight is gone so dim...&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s just because it&#39;s so dark out,&#34; Kenneth reassured her as they entered the clearing around the trailer site. &#34;We&#39;re gonna get you inside with the lights on and next to the heater, and then we can-&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s... dark... out..?&#34;

Barbara stammered each word, apparently so shocked and dazed that she hadn&#39;t realized it was nighttime. Suddenly cognizant now, she pleaded with Kenneth to leave: &#34;Go on! I&#39;ll be fine now, but you have to go.&#34;

&#34;What?&#34; Kenneth stammered. &#34;W-what are you talking about? I&#39;m only trying to help you. We need to see how bad those cuts are; if I should take you to-&#34;

&#34;You don&#39;t understand!&#34; Barbara twisted and pulled away from Kenneth&#39;s arms. &#34;I&#39;ll be okay, I promise, but you have got to get out of here!&#34;

Kenneth noticed that her strength seemed to have returned. Suddenly he realized it had more than returned, when a powerful shove knocked him skidding backwards on the seat of his pants.

&#34;What the hell!&#34; he whined, upset and confused. 

&#34;There&#39;s a change a&#39; happenin&#39;!&#34; Barbara cried out. As the clouds parted and a full moon beamed down on her, a fearsome howl filled the air: 

//&#34;AAWWOOOOO!&#34;//

Kenneth was torn completely to shreds and devoured. His remains were never found...
