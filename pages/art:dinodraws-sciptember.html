[[tab Day 1 - Factory]]

++++ **SCiPTEMBER Day 1 - Factory**
[[image https://i.imgur.com/fpuVxsC.png]]
First day piece completed (and also first post of mine of this site oh boy oh boy)! 
Done for the tale [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/this-toy-facsimile-of-life &#39;This Toy Facsimile of Life&#39;] written by [[*user Darkstuff]]
and [[*user DeviantDharma]]!
The side-by-side storytelling that was swapping between two perspectives was really really fun, which spurred the idea of a split-down-the-middle art piece, featuring two moments I think was sort of a turning point in the story- Cornelius revealing to Redd what he&#39;s been doing behind literal closed doors and the plan he has to get out of this mess as the fight against the Factory in this world is a loosing battle, and Nobody finding Holly within the world overtaken by the Factory and deciding to //care// about the situation for the first time in eons.
(also I was ESTATIC to find that there were character design references in the canon hub this tale hails from, so I utilized those to be accurate to the characters featured)

[[tab Day 2 - Reanimation]]
++++ **SCiPTEMBER Day 2 - Reanimation**
[[image https://i.imgur.com/05MkmW7.png]]
Done for [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6842 &#39;SCP-6842&#39;] by [[*user DrowningDutchman]]
Found this beastie, and as someone who LOVES to render fire- knew exactly what I had to do.
Aka draw it!! I loved the SCP itself, the MTF coming in defense of this entity in the face of a cruel doctor and giving that doctor a metaphorical (and probably literal once) middle finger. Does this doggy have a name? They should name the dog.
