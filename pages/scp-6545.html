SCP-6545 refers to a disconnected doorbell of unknown make and model that, when pressed, opens a call with an individual identifying herself as &#34;Janette Tillson&#34; (PoI-6545), who claims to be an employee of the company &#34;//Eccentric Quarters//&#34;.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Eccentric Quarters&#39; designation as a Group of Interest is currently pending.[[/span]] Research into both Tillson and Eccentric Quarters has failed to produce any conclusive results.

When connected, the user is asked for a description of their &#34;dream home&#34; with the purpose of constructing a house fitting the subject&#39;s interpretation. These residences, designated collectively as SCP-6545-A, instantly replace the interior of the person&#39;s current property following 2-3 days after contact. Notably, a set of criteria is applied when detailing the abode the individual desires, which is as follows:

* The property must not be used as a means to harm anyone, including oneself
* The individual is prohibited from selling or otherwise taking advantage of any amenities within the property in terms of business
* The property is unable to include any organisms, excluding plants
* The property is unable to replicate areas which already exist

The subject is able to repeat the process multiple times as well as ask for a &#39;refund&#39;, in which case their home’s interior returns back into its previous state. Those attempting to go against the given rules automatically have their property reverted to its previous condition; any further attempts to contact Eccentric Quarters by these individuals are rejected.

[[div class=&#34;note&#34;]]
**Interviewer:** Dr. Phillip Simmons
**Interviewee:** PoI-6545

**Foreword:** The interview was conducted in order to get further information regarding Eccentric Quarters through PoI-6545. This was under the agreement that Dr. Simmons would file a request afterward.

= **[BEGIN LOG]**

**Simmons:** Alright, it should be recording.

**PoI-6545:** Oh, you&#39;re recording this?

**Simmons:** Yes, for future reference.

**PoI-6545:** Is that so? //(Sighs)// Okay, then. Let&#39;s just hurry this up. I don&#39;t have all the time in the world, you know.

**Simmons:** Apologies... Anyways, let&#39;s begin, shall we? //(Clears throat)// How long have you been working for Eccentric Quarters, Mrs. Tillson?

**PoI-6545:** I prefer Janette, and this is my, what, second year here? Yeah, I&#39;ve been working hard since mid-April.

**Simmons:** And how&#39;d you get the job?

**PoI-6545:** You know, the usual. Filled in the job application, went on for an interview, and got the job a week or so after. The rest is history.

**Simmons:** How has the company been treating you?

**PoI-6545:** I&#39;d say it&#39;s quite alright. Nothing special, but alright. I just sit here and mind my own business, really. Pay&#39;s also good.

**Simmons:** Any complaints?

**PoI-6545:** I guess you could say it&#39;s a bit boring? Well, I don&#39;t mind. I&#39;m quite used to it by now.

**Simmons:** Who else works for the company? Anyone you knew beforehand?

**PoI-6545:** Only a few of my colleagues.

**Simmons:** How&#39;re they?

**PoI-6545:** They&#39;re fine most of the time, though they can be somewhat pushy. That might just be me, who knows... How many questions do you have left? I wanna hurry this up.

**Simmons:** It&#39;s only this question, then we&#39;re done. Again, I apologize. Could you possibly tell me the corporation’s process when gifting people their //(pause)// &#34;dream house?&#34;

//Pause.//

**Simmons:** Hello? Is anybody home?

**PoI-6545:** Ah, well, umm...it starts with- //(coughs)// sorry, c-could you give me a sec? I&#39;m like half asleep right now.

**Simmons:** Sure.

**PoI-6545:** I truly am sorry. I just haven&#39;t had coffee this morning.

**Simmons:** It&#39;s quite alright. You don&#39;t need to apologize. Just take your time.

**PoI-6545:** Thank you.

//Pause.//

**PoI-6545:** Right, so basically, it starts with the caller sending in a request of their dream home. Then, after some planning and such, we head out and presto-change-o, their house gets remodeled. Well, it&#39;s only the interior, but still.

**PoI-6545:** I would go more into detail, but I only make the calls. I don&#39;t know much of anything else.

**Simmons:** Could you at least elaborate on how they can locate their current home or what you mean by &#34;presto-change-o&#34;?

**PoI-6545:** Like I said, not my department, so I can&#39;t say //(yawns)//... So yeah, we&#39;re done here, right?

//Simmons flips through the pages in his notepad.//

**Simmons:** Mhm, that is all. Thank you very much for this interview.

**PoI-6545:** Hey, don&#39;t go thanking me just yet. You still haven&#39;t told me your dream house. We promised, remember?

**Simmons:** Of course, of course. Just, um, just give me a moment to think.

**PoI-6545:** Alright.

//Pause.//

**PoI-6545:** You done?

**Simmons:** Right, right, uh… I guess, maybe, Hogwarts? An empty version of it, obviously. //(Breathes in deeply)// I was quite the fan of Harry Potter when I was a young lad, so that would be nice.

**PoI-6545:** No can do, sir.

**Simmons:** How come?

**PoI-6545:** It&#39;s in the rules... Are you not aware of the rules?

**Simmons:** I am, but what is the problem?

**PoI-6545:** //(Sighs)// Hogwarts is in use.

= **[END LOG]**

**Afterword:** PoI-6545 declined to provide further information on this topic, citing client privilege. Further research into this claim is currently pending.
