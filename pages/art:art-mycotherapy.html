[[image https://i.imgur.com/yBZ1SW7.png]]

The room is small, covered with peeling black wallpaper. Strange fungi in unnatural neon hues grow underneath and over it: One smaller magenta mold-like fungus and another larger antler-shaped lime green variety. The walls are covered in framed pieces of art. Nice, but... clearly printed on computer paper and hung in dollar store frames.

You&#39;re completely alone. But C. Ignota has left you a note on a coffee table nearly covered in patches of the green fungi.

&gt; Feel free to enjoy my artwork while you wait. If you want to see more, here is my website for links.
&gt; [http://www.ironshears.com You can find that here.]
&gt; I&#39;ll be in in a bit. Just try not to breathe in any spores.

I finished this about a year and a half ago and I&#39;m still very very proud of it! It&#39;s one of my favorite pieces of all time. I loved drawing all of the little mushrooms and plants and bones.

SCP-135 has always been one of my favorites since I read it way back when and I still think about it quite a lot. Something about it is just haunting, I guess.

When I can hold a pen again I&#39;m going to draw more plants.

This is some promo art for my first SCP! I couldn&#39;t do very much before my hand started hurting too bad so it&#39;s still a sketch but I think it works anyways!

I wanted to kinda have an ambiguous thing on whether she was writing &#34;Hello&#34; or &#34;Help&#34; but I kinda wrote the L crooked. By the time I realized my hand hurt too much to fix it. But after I showing my friends, I immediately received this.
&gt; &#34;personality test: is she writing the L in &#34;help&#34; or the Y in &#39;hey&#39;&#34; [[*user paperbackstab]]
So I&#39;m going to pretend it was intentional.

I hope the fact that I... drew my own SCP ONE TIME. I hope that isn&#39;t too much of a deterrent from viewing the rest of my art.

This one turned out really nice! I&#39;m very proud of the fact you can&#39;t really tell the snow is looping.

SCP-6420 is very weird in terrifying ways. Definitely one of those that you don&#39;t realize you started thinking about until you catch yourself making that face angry chihuahuas make. But like, in a disgusting way? Yeah.

Reminds me a lot of Sacculina, a parasitic barnacle that does something similar and also elicits that emotion. &#34;Fiction that reminds me of real-life biology fact&#34; is a very quick way to make me like something.

I REALLY like the colors on this one! The red was going to be just a placeholder but I really liked the rose-colored glasses fall look that it was giving. I am super proud of this one.

SCP-5851 is weird in a very fun way. Reminds me of fanfics I was terrified of people knowing I read in middle school. Telling kids they are &#39;cringe&#39; for enjoying cringe things is a plague on this society. They&#39;re children. Let them have their age-appropriate harmless fun. 

Kids making goofy art is a part of growing up. I am fighting and losing the urge to show everyone what is quite possibly the best piece of art I&#39;ve ever created in my entire life. [https://imgur.com/a/D284c09 And I lost]... So that&#39;s in the public domain now.

Is struggled a lot with the colors on this one... but I like how it turned out anyway! The animation was a lot more involved in this one than my pieces normally are too so this one took me a lot longer than most.

My internet was down for 71 hours and I had to go to a café to download the webpage so I could actually read it in full for reference. So I was still sitting there at home with the raw early-internet-looking webpage with no theme. And yet, I still really liked it, lol.

6032 is wild; I&#39;m always a sucker for big eldritch horrors. There&#39;s a lot of very fun imagery in there, too. And some puns. I don&#39;t really know what else to say about it without completely spoiling it so I&#39;m gonna leave it there and say y&#39;all should read it :)

I went a little wild with the color theory on this one but I&#39;m so happy with how it turned out. I also did a biiiiit more of an involved animation than usual because I really got into it. Jeez I&#39;m gonna have to start picking out fun palettes ahead of time it was a lot easier. I know it was an omelet but a fried egg read better in pixel art 😭

I&#39;m normally more of a Paleozoic person than a Mesozoic one but oh boy do I love this SCP. Ty Rex is so silly and I love the whole vibe of it. The room full of enthusiastic scientists not listening to the voice of reason was extremely enjoyable.

I wanted to make absolutely certain I was drawing the juvenile T-Rex accurately(Well, as accurately as I could in the style) so I referenced a bunch of photos of that one very complete fossil of a juvenile and was kinda surprised how raptor-like their faces were! In 20 years after more research is done this is still going to be obviously inaccurate though. Thus is the cycle of paleontology.

Since the last one was so fun I have decided I am only doing dramatic color palettes now. So far so good! I did struggle a bit at the beginning with making everything actually... look okay. Especially with the limited color palette and the plushies popping out of the background enough. But I think it&#39;s good enough! I did have a bit of trouble finding stuff to animate here that I could actually do without causing a flare-up in my wrist so the animation on this one is pretty minimal.

SCP-4966 is definitely cheesy sugarwater and I mean that in the best possible way. It has the same vibe those old animations kids on youtube would make of like warrior cats or valve games or whatever back before youtube animation stopped being made in MSPaint. I&#39;m a sentimental bitch and that kind of goofy fun always makes me smile and reminds me of my childhood. I can definitely see it being too goofy and not being everyone&#39;s cup of tea but... I like that kind of thing.

I really like the colors on this one. Kind of an eerie ghostly mood. Plus I got to learn how to use gradient maps! Ahhh... It&#39;s kind of spooky but not overly oppressive.

SCP-6096 has a really really fun vibe. It&#39;s scary but not in an outward way. It&#39;s hopeless in a sort of peaceful kind of way. Relatively speaking this anomaly isn&#39;t really that dangerous or frightening. It kills people, sure, but compared to other SCPs? It&#39;s not that much of a threat

But you can&#39;t stop it.

The color on this was so worth the three days of struggle they look so crisp and cool. I haven&#39;t really done pixel art where I&#39;ve defined HIGHLIGHTS out of darkness rather than the other way around and it ended up being really really fun. I&#39;m definitely gonna have to do that more, haha.

The timer definitely gave me anxiety and I felt like I was rushing through it the first time. I read it through like three times to make sure I was getting details properly and honestly? It was better the second time through. Which is usually a good sign! I found myself catching all the little hints and noticing things I didn&#39;t notice the first time through. It&#39;s safe to say I really liked it.

(Also I added two different versions of the gif, one with 2744 to make it easier for offsite people to find and one with the actual title for accuracy(Also also I had to cut out one of the list entries in the loop video audio because It wouldn&#39;t fit otherwise but that portion was so perfect to not use 😭))

The loop video I did for this one is my favorite so far I had some fun with it lmao. I got to get all dramatic because! Well, it was fitting. I had to get kinda creative with the anomaly because there wasn&#39;t a super great description of it(Which is not a fault of the article at all). I also got a little artistic license with the definition of a &#34;fetal position&#34; but I wanted the monster to be REALLY looming over Micheals.

I love this article. It&#39;s such a clever idea. I read it after the video log was removed and I actually went back and checked out the video log to check if there was a better description of the anomaly and I definitely agree that it does better without it. The simplicity with the strong payoff of the concept really really makes it

I honestly don&#39;t have anything else to say besides seriously go read it.

For some reason I wanted to do a vaguely 70s bathroom scene I don&#39;t know why. I guess it just felt fitting for some reason? It&#39;s... probably something I arbitrarily decided based on the color scheme I picked out hahaha.

 Anyways I LOVE the kind of goofy fridge horror-type articles and this one definitely falls in that category. There&#39;s a backstory that&#39;s just implied yet despite never being told it, you can pretty easily read into it. A very quiet sort of upsettingness. Go read it!

Also Tstaffor, I was already in the planning phase for this one when you messaged me so I couldn&#39;t do the one you requested just yet 😭. I will try and ALSO do the one you requested eventually! It&#39;s on my list right now. I love getting requests from authors plugging their work!

For various reasons, this is probably gonna be the last one of these I do. At least for quite a while. But I think it turned out well anyway. It&#39;s a bit simpler than the other ones I&#39;ve done but I think it&#39;s fitting. This is definitely an incredible article. Very emotionally impactful with no room for comfort.

I wanted the colors to reflect that. At first, I was going to have the background go deeper and deeper underground with the coffin at the bottom but it just didn&#39;t feel right. It just wasn&#39;t lonely enough.

That&#39;s the kind of vibe it needed to give off.

Okay, I ended up not taking a break. Needed a distraction from bad health news. Either way, this turned out really cute! I think I drew 682 way cuter than 999 somehow but... I mean. It turned out adorable. The vibe reminds me of Kirby&#39;s pad from Kirby&#39;s epic yarn. Which is, I know, an extremely specific reference.

When I started these I said I was only gonna do more recent articles, and I&#39;m still DEFINITELY gonna focus on more recent articles. But... I think I&#39;m gonna throw in some classics just for flavor if people on TikTok ask for them. Gotta reward engagement or whatever.

Plus, when you do old ones they don&#39;t have a lot of stories so you don&#39;t have to //explain them//. Which means... I can just yell into a microphone about my //opinion// for the full minute. I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s clear by now based on how much talking I do on my art pages that I LOVE to ramble about my opinion.

This one was really really fun! I had an idea and ended up asking in the IRC if anyone wanted to be interviewed about their article for a video and [[*user Doctor Fullham]] and one other person responded so I got to do a longer format fun little video 😭.

This has been really really fun so far but I think the longer format might do better on //Youtube.// Plus then I wouldn&#39;t have a time limit to conform to... In the future for interview thingies, I might do the regular explanation video I normally do on Tiktok... then mention the long format interview in the video? Videos over 60 seconds tend to perform poorly and It&#39;d probably get more eyes on the interview in the long run to just mention it in a video that does better lmaooooo. We&#39;ll see.

Still, I really like this article! It&#39;s got a very somber tone and definitely has a lot to relate to. That kind of frustration when you&#39;ve worked so hard and gotten //so close/// to being something only for you to fall back in a hole is really //really// common. And it ISN&#39;T about angry birds.

I wanted to do a sunset-y color theme both because... well it&#39;s pretty. But *also* because I thought it could represent something. I don&#39;t know. Maybe explaining my artistic vision is kind of defeating the point of having it.

Apparently, I go bonkers on the pixel art for Dysadon articles? Lmaoooo. Either way, the SCENE is from SCP-5733 but the //colors// are from SCP-6733. **Read both** these honestly might be my new favorite articles.

When I saw SCP-6733 I realized I hadn&#39;t read 5733 yet so I read that one first. And by the end of I was like &#34;This was good as hell there&#39;s no way 6733 stands up to it&#34; but it DID. They&#39;re both GREAT articles on their own and you don&#39;t NEED to read the first one to get it but it just adds a whole bunch to it. 

Honestly? Go read both of them. I linked both above next to the process video link. They&#39;re incredible.

(Oh yeah, I&#39;m also trying a thing where I upload the loop and process videos on different days? maybe posting on more days will do better on TikTok.)

Normally more of a squishy, slimy invertebrate person but arthropods are fun too! Especially the ones that metamorphosis. Fun fact: moths and butterflies completely liquefy when in the chrysalis and the different parts of them grow separately before re-attaching to each other. //BUT/// they still retain memories from when they were caterpillars.

This probably just implies that at least part of the nervous system remains intact while the majority of the body turns to soup but... if you have an imagination it could mean something cooler probably. Moths are metal as hell. 

Another one where I interviewed the author! These have all been really fun to do, especially getting to draw the little characters but the last one was too long for TikTok, apparently, so I decided to do the regular process video for TikTok AND  Youtube video with the interview. This seems to be a good strategy! I&#39;ve also started making the videos take up less time than the full minute. Seems to make them perform better so far.

The TikTok thing is already at 666 views([https://i.imgur.com/mfuGRqs.png yes that&#39;s exactly what it was at when I looked]) which means more people, in the long run, will see the interview. ahhhhhhh algorithms.

I know it was WATER spilled on Dr. White&#39;s phone but I felt like coffee would read better so I went with that. I also messed with the colors quite a bit for this. before deciding on them. Normally my stuff&#39;s got really unnatural hues but for this one this kinda more neutral/blueish palette ended up working well with the coffee and the sterile environment. 

The articles I draw usually have at least an //undertone// of something upsetting(I mean. Minus 999 but that&#39;s an outlier!). This one&#39;s just kinda goofy. I like it! Sometimes it&#39;s nice to just have something kinda fun.

I do fully believe Dr. White deserved it, though. RIP to Dr. Warren.

I ended up doing 5847 like I said I would! I love how the colors on this one turned out. :,)

Usually, I just end up doing some complementary color palettes because... they&#39;re easy and look nice... but there were so many different types of food in this one I just went ahead and made it rainbow. It ended up fitting!

I did a short mini-interview with Tstaffor on youtube for this one. It&#39;s linked w/ all the other stuff I normally link on these, haha.

This article is goofy as hell in a good way. I&#39;ve said it before but sometimes it&#39;s fun to just have fun.

This is legitimately one of the cutest articles I&#39;ve ever read and I don&#39;t really have anything else to say about it other than it might be my new favorite. I wanted to make the main art look like those murals you see on the walls of children&#39;s hospitals because... it felt fitting thematically. The gif version of this kinda messed up the colors so I recommend checking out the video versions.

The first and immediate idea I had for this was that it needed to not be anything directly shown in the actual article. I wanted it to show the //implication//.

I made one of the operatives lean down so the kid could touch the patch on their shoulder. It&#39;s such a classic, cute little-kid-meets-a-firefighter pose. If you&#39;ve spent any time around children while wearing really anything &#34;interesting&#34; you know they LOVE when you ask if they want to touch that hat they keep staring at. Then they steal it from you and you get lice.

I was going to just leave it at that for this because I thought it&#39;d be funny. But I wanted to talk about how I referenced an experience I had when I was really little for this one. I was SO unbelievably sure I saw a ghost on Christmas eve when I was like 4. In reality, it was probably just sheets blowing outside but it scared me for years.

 I heard it was djkaktus&#39;s birthday so I posted a day early this week! Yay! I was already planning on doing this article before I found out so I wanted to make it a little more present-y rather than just my usual stuff so I put a little cactus in there for ya. I don&#39;t know you but I do like making people happy :)

I really like this article. I love the pessimistic AI that subverts the tropes associated with pessimistic AIs and does something wholesome instead. It&#39;s very sweet and I love it. 

Also, I switched to APNGs to preserve the color quality better so if it&#39;s not animating click [https://i.imgur.com/hz7FjFr.gif here] to see a gif(or just check out the videos for the higher res animation). 

But yeah! Happy birthday!

Last Christmas article of the year! This article is... the whole reason I did Christmas articles this year... For real, I haven&#39;t done anything special for Christmas in like... 6 years.

LORDXVNV requested this article and said not to tell Ralliston so it&#39;d be a surprise and I got SO excited about it(especially AFTER reading the article) I put on a whole multi-week plan of Christmas articles leading up to it as the grand finale LMAOOOOO.

I... really really like this article. It&#39;s got such a nice theme and it introduced me to another cool canon! I guess I relate to that feeling of wanting to make other people happy. That&#39;s why I do art in the first place :)

Ah yes! Time to be done with Holiday stuff and get back to my list. I went with kinda a blacklight color scheme on this one! wanted to do some bright neon colors.

I like this article! It&#39;s fun and kinda goofy but also has thair air of &#34;The Foundation fucking sucks, huh?&#34; that a lot of articles have. Which. Yeah. //Yeah//. I wanted to make the people WATCHING the test pretty visible in this one. I also just tend to find the dynamic between the foundation and GAW objects interesting anyways. They always take things too far.

I am kinda worried about why she got left alone after that competition though :(

This article is so sweet and cute. 😭

I love the imagery and how overall just wholesome it is. I&#39;m a sentimental dumbass so ofc this one got me big. It&#39;s just a gentle, positive but sad story about grief, love, and the end of life. The build-up feels graceful and the end is well earned.

I like this one. Go read it.

I knew I had to draw a play structure for this because it was definitely the first thing I thought of! Also ended up trying a quaternary color scheme. Never really done that before! I think it turned out nice!

I&#39;ve been trying to experiment more with the colors lately because more often than not I just end up going with complementary palettes. I think there&#39;s a lot of room for exploration but always end up going back to that. 

But yeah! I think this one turned out soft.

You know I used to think I was afraid of cockroaches for YEARS. But what had ACTUALLY happened was that in middle school I read a very Christian fanfiction about l4d and one of the characters was scared of cockroaches and at that age, I still thought you could pick things you were scared of so I was like &#34;I guess I&#39;m scared of cockroaches now&#34;

Then at one point someone asked me why I was scared of cockroaches and just replied that one time a bunch of them came running out of a box and over my feet in the garage. That had happened way before the fanfiction thing and didn&#39;t actually freak me out that much but I was way too embarrassed to say it was something I&#39;d copied from a fucking left 4 dead fanfiction. So... when people asked I kept saying that

But because I kept saying that over and over again I FORGOT WHY I was doing it originally... but kept pretending to be afraid of cockroaches. This lasted until senior year when I re-discovered that fanfiction and went through all 5 stages of grief at once before eventually collapsing in on myself like a dying star and promising to never speak of this again. Like I&#39;m doing right now. Sorry past me.

Anyways this article&#39;s really good. I like that the Agent and the D-Class are familiar with each other. I think it should be done more often. It really gives it some weight to it.

Listen. I LOVE this article. So much so that I read it all the way through like 3 times to make SURE I was explaining it properly STILL didn&#39;t get tired of it. Despite that, I&#39;m 99% sure I misunderstood or explained SOMETHING wrong in the video. A 50-second video is not a lot of time to explain such a long article.

I&#39;ve been lurking for years on this site before joining but even still I somehow never paid attention to any of the content focused on researcher characters so I had to write a book report on these characters to make them recognizable in the drawing. I still know nothing and don&#39;t think I accomplished it for anyone besides Clef.

I&#39;m sorry everyone I&#39;ve failed you. But hey! This is still one of my favorite ones I&#39;ve done so far. Definitely one of the most involved animations. I think this article deserves it.

This one was very fun! I tried adding more movement to this one. For a while, I had Dr. Taylor&#39;s corpse switching between an all-black version, alive, and the regular one but it felt like there was too much going on.

It ended up working better in those 10 minutes or so after a murder when everything is very very quiet and you just silently consider what you&#39;d just done. When it doesn&#39;t feel real yet.

Managed to squeeze a tale I really like into a video TikTok wanted me to make!

I really liked this story because I mean... I love friendly monsterlike characters, the Wanderer&#39;s Library, anomalies escaping from Foundation custody, and looking at pictures. It&#39;s all a win! I didn&#39;t even KNOW you could do tales that were comics before I saw Whitney&#39;s stuff and have been wanting to draw something from one of them for a while now. Ended up doing TWO technically.

I know the signs weren&#39;t supposed to be light up but I... felt like the piece needed more movement. I think it turned out very well!

Remind me not to do two huge projects in one in the period of 3 days again. Please. 

Otherwise... this turned out REALLY cool. I want to do a few broad-spectrum GoI/general concept videos so I started with this one. Not what I normally do but! Eh. Also, I have NO idea what to credit this as other than the logo because it&#39;s not really based on any one person&#39;s work and is kinda just... a general representation of an interview? If I did it wrong please let me know.

I also drew a lot of extra art for this one. 
These three! Funnily enough, I actually drew these ones first. And drew them in the backward order of when they first show up in the video?  I DO know how to credit THESE.

Needed to come up with my own 173 design but I wanted to preserve the ENERGY that everyone knows and not everyone loves. Was extremely close to just drawing one of those squeezy toys but I am pretty sure those are also not CC.

For 683... This is the second time I&#39;ve drawn it and at this point, I refuse to ever do it justice. I have a huge soft spot for kids and an overwhelming disgust for anything that would put them in danger so 053&#39;s story has always been upsetting. I want her to be happy at the expense of the big dumb --beluga whale-- lizard.

I don&#39;t have any fun insightful commentary about 096. I&#39;m gonna be honest I&#39;ve never really had strong feelings about it.

I LOVE the way this one turned out. I had the idea to make the whole test chamber cake about halfway through and was like &#34;Oh yeah.&#34; I know it&#39;s not actually in the article but there&#39;s no canon and the original article doesn&#39;t have anything in it implying this WOULDN&#39;T be possible(Not to mention the fact that hyperrealistic cake videos are godless plains of existence where I&#39;ve seen a wall turn out to be the cake) so technically there&#39;s no reason it COULDN&#39;T have happened.

Also, I&#39;m going back to my roots with this one.

The first time I ever did pixel art was when I tried to make a Minecraft texture pack where the whole world was cake. I had no idea what I was doing and got frustrated that dirt had the textured on ALL sides and gave up. Years later I revisited the idea once resource packs became a thing and I was able to get the dirt to look nice. But by that point, it was 1.13 and there were way too many blocks in the game. Maybe one day I&#39;ll finish it.

This article is very short and to the point and implies a lot without saying much. I like it! It&#39;s got a fun vibe that I haven&#39;t seen done a lot before. Whenever there&#39;s some undescribed threat I always end up drawing tentacles for some reason. They&#39;re just easy to draw and fun to animate.

I wanted to try something similar to the familiar black and white clinical-y graphics people use for a while now and the public interaction tone of this article seemed fitting for it! I asked on Twitter whether I should use dithering or not and people really liked the dithering it on a small scale but it did not turn out well in the final piece so I ended up not using it. You can kinda see me messing with it in the video. Thank you to everyone who offered their thoughts, though!

This is an older article but I love spec-bio a lot. It&#39;s not particularly impressive or long but it&#39;s a cute fun little thing. Sometimes that kinda stuff just catches my imagination better, I guess? Yeah. There&#39;s another spec-bio article I want to draw something for too eventually but I have been pretty busy getting ready for my hand surgery and had to pick one or the other.

Speaking of surgery, that&#39;s happening next Friday and I&#39;ve got some stuff I need to get done before then so this is going to be the last one of these for a while, at least until after I&#39;ve healed. I am gonna try and read out some of the articles I&#39;ve drawn so far in full on youtube though, just to have SOMETHING to do while I&#39;m healing.

Still, I hope I landed on a high note. I love drawing foliage and I kinda went all out for this one. I wanted to semi-accurately portray the species of trees listed(Japanese Red Pine and Silver-leaf Oak) and draw a cute little creature in there. That fox-like repto-mammal.

I LOVE this one. I know there&#39;s not as much animation as there normally is... which was completely intentional. I wanted it to feel empty because I mean... read the article.

Speaking of which, this is definitely my favorite entry out of all the dept-con articles I&#39;ve read so far. It&#39;s just got such a fun vibe! It&#39;s simple, weird, and got all those little details that make my brain spark a little bit.

I FOR SURE do not think I understand it completely, even after reading all the other articles. I&#39;ve got a few ideas, but that&#39;s part of the fun, right? Not knowing for sure.

Also, I&#39;m back hi.

Okay WOW, I kept putting off doing this one because I wanted to be super ambitious and wanted to make the whole planet turn slowly but realized after drawing the first frame that I COULD NOT do that lmao. 

I like this article! It&#39;s got a simple concept that I suppose is pretty &#34;common&#34;(?) but the angle it was portrayed at is unique and interesting enough to keep me interested and ends up as something I liked quite a lot!

THIS one was for Nikki&#39;s birthday and I forgot to post it on here OTL.

But yeah! I wanted to go for a darkroom feel. But PINK instead of red. Or I guess magenta. Really, this would not work as a real darkroom but boy does it look pretty!

I really like this article, lol. It&#39;s simple, funny, and just interesting! I originally found this article by literally just searching the word &#34;Anomalocaris&#34; and ended up really liking it. THEN as I was working on this, I made a post about needing new article suggestions and Aftokrator responded. 

Somehow I had not connected the dots that this was written by Aftokrator until that moment.

ALSO I didn&#39;t save the animation layer before closing OR exporting the gif, though so I had to convert the video to the gif!!!!!! &gt;:(

UGH!!!!! It&#39;s a little messed up but the video looks fine at least 😭

I like the format of this article! I think the &#34;confused about which one&#39;s the actual anomaly&#34; is a fun concept and I like the execution. 

The art on this one has a lot more &#34;realistic&#34; colors than I normally do just because I wanted to make it look kinda natural. Granted, they&#39;re definitely not... REAL colors... but... you know, lol. 

I also really like DChance&#39;s whole speech near the end. First line kinda made me chortle.

I like the way this one turned out! I got a little experimental with the color palette on this one. It&#39;s not really a real... basic art theory palette but I still think it looks nice! I guess it&#39;s KINDA split-complementary? But not really. Normally I&#39;m more strict about exclusively following color theory.

This is also the first piece I did for the SCP for Corgo Campaign! This one is for Weiserthanyou. I&#39;m glad I could be a part of that :)
