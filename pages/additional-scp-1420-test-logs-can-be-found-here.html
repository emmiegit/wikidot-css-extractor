__**Specimens Used:**__

**SCP-1420-1-39**
&gt; **Description:** A round scaled creature with 5 legs separated at equal distances on the body. Limbs end in small beaks. 350 grams.

&gt; **Behavior:** Highly aggressive. When presented feed mice, uses tentacles to grip prey and restrain them. Primary method of killing is its jaws.


__**Result of Cross-Test:**__ After both specimens were placed in a terrarium, Specimen 40 attacked Specimen 39 almost immediately. Specimen 40 devoured Specimen 39 and promptly ran under a decorative tree branch in the terrarium. Specimen 40 terminated without incident.</textarea></pre>
