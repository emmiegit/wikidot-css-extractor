**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7450 is a gathering place for a Sarkic Cult known as the &#34;Festering City&#34;. Due to Foundation agreements with this group prior to SCP-7450, Foundation personnel will be informed of any new locations to which SCP-7450 is set to relocate at least 24 hours in advance. 

Foundation personnel are not to detain or interfere with the passage of Festering City members into SCP-7450. 

**Description:** SCP-7450 is the restaurant &#34;Jäämaa&#34; [[footnote]] &#34;Frozen Land&#34;, presumably a poor translation of &#34;Iceland&#34; in Finnish. [[/footnote]] --in Reykjavik, Iceland--. SCP-7450 is an anomalous space which is used as a front and a secure code transmission zone by the Festering City Sarkic Cult. 

**Addendum 1: Discovery** 

On July 8, 2021, embedded Foundation personnel within Reykjavik City Police became aware of a &#34;mass psychosis&#34; event occuring at Jäämaa. Seven customers and three staff reportedly developed extreme anger and frustration suddenly and were initially unable to explain the cause of their emotions. However, after being placed in police cars and driven away from Jäämaa, all ten individuals recounted being unable to articulate the word &#34;Hardfiskur&#34;, an Icelandic dried fish dish. 

Following the amnesticization of these subjects, Jäämaa was designated SCP-7450 and closed down under cover of a health department order, following financial compensation of the owner. 

Testing revealed that within the bounds of SCP-7450, the word &#34;Hardfiskur&#34; cannot be spoken. Attempts to speak the word will result in a different word, typically from the Finnish language, being spoken.

**Addendum 2: Riihimäki Incident** 

On August 7, 2022, SCP-7450 spontaneously demanifested from Reykjavik and appeared amidst a residential neighborhood (Koppelintie) in the city of Riihimäki, Finland. 

When Foundation personnel became aware of SCP-7450&#39;s new location, a research team was sent to the location in order to assess the situation. Upon arriving, SCP-7450 was staffed by a single entity, an apparent female of middle age wearing a long, pleated robe which appeared to consist entirely of skin physically grafted to its neck. 

This entity, now dubbed SCP-7450-1, cooperated with Foundation personnel while inside SCP-7450. However, SCP-7450-1 exited the building through a back exit and could not be brought back to a Foundation facility for questioning. The below is a transcript of Dr. Oksana Bellikova&#39;s interaction with SCP-7450-1. 

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Dr. Bellikova:** Hey. 

//SCP-7450-1 is chopping some fish on a cutting board while making eye contact with Dr. Bellikova.//

**SCP-7450-1:** Hey. 

**Dr. Bellikova:** Can you tell me if you&#39;re responsible for the, uh, geographical shift this place just had? 

**SCP-7450-1:** Absolutely not. 

**Dr. Bellikova:** No, or you can&#39;t tell me? 

**SCP-7450-1:** No, I&#39;m not behind it. I&#39;m not in the business of flinging my house across the map. But it happens. 

**Dr. Bellikova:** Your house? Excuse me? 

**SCP-7450-1:** It isn&#39;t my first choice, that&#39;s for damn sure. But it&#39;s safe, and it&#39;s a place to stay while metal freaks are marching around looking to chop you to bits. 

**Dr. Bellikova:** Am I supposed to know what you mean? 

**SCP-7450-1:** No, you&#39;re not, I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s been a long time since anyone, well, stepped on our toes, other than our actual adversaries. Ever since that disaster with the Hardfiskur, we&#39;ve been getting our codes out of order. 

**Dr. Bellikova:** Your codes? Please, I don&#39;t even know who you are, spare me the lingo. Explain what&#39;s going on here, can you? 

**SCP-7450-1:** Let me start from the absolute beginning. &#34;Hardfiskur&#34; is the key, when I set up the safe house here, anyone who said &#34;Hardfiskur&#34; would have their true intentions communicated in a way that the wire-and-metal spies couldn&#39;t listen in. 

**Dr. Bellikova:** Ah, I think I get it. So you could hear what someone really meant by what they said in place of Hardfiskur, using some cypher. But what&#39;s the significance of Hardfiskur, why did you want to hide it? 

**SCP-7450-1:** Well, when you&#39;re in the mood to eat a fish god-

**Dr. Bellikova:** Oh god, you&#39;re a sarkic cultist aren&#39;t you. 

**SCP-7450-1:** No fucking shit. As I was saying, in that case, you don&#39;t want to invite anyone else who might want to stop you from eating that fish god. That&#39;s why we&#39;ve got a restaurant, people come to eat here- but most of the civilians are just here to eat normal food. Of course, this one hipster read about Hardfiskur on the internet and tried to ask if we had it. Do you understand? Do you understand that since our code was scrambled by that civilian, I had to flee all the way to Finland just to make sure our door wasn&#39;t kicked down by tickers? You wouldn&#39;t appreciate if a random civilian ruined a Foundation front, and we don&#39;t appreciate them ruining ours. 

**Dr. Bellikova:** That&#39;s all fair, but why are you making this &#34;fish god&#34; into Hardfiskur? Is that part of your Sarkic rituals? 

**SCP-7450-1:** What, no! That? Well, my grandmother always made great hardfiskur with regular fish, so I figured...
