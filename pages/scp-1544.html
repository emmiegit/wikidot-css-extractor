**Item #:** SCP-1544

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1544 is to be given a minimum of 5 by 5 by 4 meters of space in its containment, in a biological containment chamber within Site-32. Upbeat music is to be played within SCP-1544&#39;s containment chamber during its feeding; SCP-1544 will consume any type of meat, and is to be fed daily.

**Description:** SCP-1544&#39;s exterior is a mobile, 1 meter tall[[footnote]] SCP-1544 can extend beyond this height.[[/footnote]] multicolored skin covering. It is controlled by a small, peach-colored mass located in the center. This interior flesh appears to be gelatin,[[footnote]] As observed from the organism&#39;s feeding process.[[/footnote]] and it is connected to a thin skeletal system that makes up SCP-1544&#39;s limbs. SCP-1544 feeds by using its central mass to envelope food it takes in through its limbs.
 
SCP-1544&#39;s skin is abnormally resistant to damage, and is also able to flex its arms to 5 meters in length. SCP-1544 is also able to move at speeds exceeding 35 kilometers per hour, by flipping its hands and feet over itself in a cartwheel fashion. However, SCP-1544 will hibernate at temperatures exceeding 85° C to preserve energy and prevent its interior from overheating.

SCP-1544 has a jovial temperament, and appears to take great pleasure in dancing. SCP-1544 will playfully nudge and bump personnel, though it will not purposely cause harm. SCP-1544 will only dance if music is audible in its area; otherwise, SCP-1544 will display depression, and will lay or sit down on the ground away from personnel. It will also become apathetic towards any outside stimulus, and will refuse to consume any food. SCP-1544 will not return to its usual behavior until music is played once more.

SCP-1544 was discovered in 19██, after escaping from a traveling circus and cutting a path through the surrounding forest. All circus employees were administered Class-B amnestics, and SCP-1544 was subsequently contained by the Foundation, including all documents involving it.

Documents surrounding SCP-1544 are available to Level 3 personnel and up.

**Addendum 1:** The following is a document discovered with SCP-1544.
