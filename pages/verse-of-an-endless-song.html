We are, all of us, music. 

We are, all of us, fire and song.

While still babes in the womb, we know the song of the earth, the harmony of the spheres,

and as children we look out to the golden lands beyond the hills.


Ah, but so we forget

And lose ourselves in the mists of life

Where the story goes untold,

And we forget the magic beneath our feet

And our song is left a trailing note

Hanging in the lonely wind.


Sing! Sing, my friends! Burn brightly in the night,

and sing ‘till the song’s ending and the dancing’s done.

[[tab What is this?]]

Over the last several years, I have slowly developed a patchwork canon within my body of work, offhandedly named the Djoricverse. This hub is an attempt to collect all of my related pieces into a single whole – revising out inconsistencies, expanding upon threads and characters, filling in blank spaces of the timeline, and overhauling plot arcs as needed. None 

The hub is a bit bare-bones now, and far from its finished state (I cannot guarantee anything), but I wanted to get it up to at least show some sense of direction.
