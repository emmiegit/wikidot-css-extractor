**Name:** D-9123 &#34;Connie&#34; Crowell

**Security Clearance:** Level 1

**Position:** D-Class Personnel

**Latest assingment:** ______

**History:** It is unknown how D-9123 came into Foundation custody as there are no original records of her and she suffers from amnesia. An extremely popular member of on-site Class-D Personnel who quickly became famous for her abnormally high memetic, amnestic and congitohazardous resistance as well as being generally very lucky during dangerous scenarios. Reason for any of this is currently unknown.

**Profile:** Suffers from amnesia, was assigned a number and chose her own name. Has shown bravery during tests and is not affected by most lower level memetic effects and is highly resistant to all amnestics currently in Foundation posession. Investigation is on-going.
