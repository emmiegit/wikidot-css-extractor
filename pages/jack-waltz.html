Hi, I&#39;m Jack. Jack Waltz.

Why am I here, you ask? Well, I&#39;m not all too sure myself. I just feel like I exist in this world, of emptiness. I only feel nothing, the nothingness that exists around me. I know everything //is// there, and always will be, but... 

Does it all really exist?

Hm, where am I?

Why am I here?

I don&#39;t know myself, but, hm...

I wonder if I&#39;ll rot with time like the rest of them.

I guess I&#39;m pretty ancient, something akin to a husk.

Sometimes, for the briefest of moments, I picture this //beautiful// sight...

A view of the infinite darkness...

A void, simply uncaring...

The luxury of being able to merely, not care no more...

And just sleep everything away, in an undisturbed slumber...

Truly a virtue, man shall never reach.

Speaking of which, was I ever a man?

Probably, though I don&#39;t quite remember...

Hm? Oh, sorry for going on like that, guess I forgot you were even here.

I&#39;m fine myself. It&#39;s been a long day, I&#39;m kinda tired. Though, how about you?

You&#39;d like to know more about me?

Well...

I guess I&#39;ve made lots here.

To me, it&#39;s like my own little smear in the grand scheme, no matter how insignificant.

I&#39;m very proud of them all, very very much.

I think I should have a list here somewhere.

Ah!

This whole article started out as a huge joke on the SCPD Discord server when [[*user moremuffins]] suggested that we write an SCP article with //10 co-authors//. Well, I guess we took it a little too seriously...

[[*user Elunerazim]], [[*user MoreMuffins]], [[*user Aftokrator]], [[*user LORDXVNV]], [[*user Lt Flops]], [[*user GreenGolem]], [[*user JakdragonX]], [[*user Cole 13]], [[*user MetalRavioli]] and I got together to make this article in an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse exquisite-corpse style] collaboration and... it was a lot of fun! Though the final product may not be the best, I, and likely the others, are really happy with how it turned out. Additionally, we all hate [[*user moremuffins]] now.

If you&#39;d like to see the process that went into its making, check out this [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C5VZLnn0LcaXoj7iV2WmP-57xcWO5ubKIwEiycS-FgU/edit?usp=sharing spreadsheet] where we first drafted this SCP line-by-line!

This idea, unsurprisingly, slithered its way into my head while I was having a shower, as all (good) ideas do.

This concept started as the imagery of a Death-like figure standing next to a headstone, lamenting... and voilà, look what it&#39;s turned into!

And, of course, let&#39;s not forget that this was inspired //greatly// by [[[SCP-4999]]] and [[[SCP-6072]]]! Both of them are greater SCPs than this one right here, but you should read mine first. If you haven&#39;t already realised, this is a threat.

Written in collaboration with [[*user ozzylizard]], an amazing co-author to work with! This all started out as one of his solo projects, but with a draft critique request, which I accepted, it eventually led to the two of us working together to write this one up! 

I had some great fun working on this with its core concept derived from cryptids, particularly the &#34;Bigfoot&#34; and other large hairy humanoids. So if I&#39;ve piqued your interest with that, maybe you should give it a read! Also note this is the longest SCP on my catalogue so far with well over 6,000 words, couldn&#39;t have done it without [[*user ozzylizard]] and his support!

This is my very first piece relying heavily on dialogue! It was a lot of fun to write and is also the second article of [[*user cremo]]&#39;s I&#39;ve rewritten (the former SCP-5392).

Well, that was a nice talk. So--

Hm? If I... If I stop?

Well, I guess if I do go silent for a while...

...I&#39;m more than happy to hand everything I&#39;ve made to [[*user uncle nicolini]], [[*user machen2]], [[*user moremuffins]], and [[*user nebulousstar]], all great people I&#39;ve met here, who&#39;ll be able to do whatever they&#39;d like with my stuff! And everything I&#39;ve co-authored will go to the respective co-authors, of course!

Well, I&#39;m tired...

Mentioned I was tired earlier, didn&#39;t I?

Guess I might take a nap.

Well, see you later!

Let&#39;s see each other again, another time!
