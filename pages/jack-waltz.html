Hi, I&#39;m Jack. Jack Waltz.

Why am I here, you ask? Well, I&#39;m not all too sure myself. I just feel like I exist in this world, of emptiness. I only feel nothing, the nothingness that exists around me. I know everything //is// there, and always will be, but... 

Does it all really exist?

Hm, where am I?

Why am I here?

I don&#39;t know myself, but, hm...

I wonder if I&#39;ll rot with time like the rest of them.

I guess I&#39;m pretty ancient, something akin to a husk.

Sometimes, for the briefest of moments, I picture this //beautiful// sight...

A view of the infinite darkness...

A void, simply uncaring...

The luxury of being able to merely, not care no more...

And just sleep everything away, in an undisturbed slumber...

Truly a virtue, man shall never reach.

Speaking of which, was I ever a man?

Probably, though I don&#39;t quite remember...

Hm? Oh, sorry for going on like that, guess I forgot you were even here.

I&#39;m fine myself. It&#39;s been a long day, I&#39;m kinda tired. Though, how about you?

You&#39;d like to know more about me?

Well...

I guess I&#39;ve made lots here.

To me, it&#39;s like my own little smear in the grand scheme, no matter how insignificant.

I&#39;m very proud of them all, very very much.

I think I should have a list here somewhere.

Ah!

There we go, just give me a second to put this all in order.

Here, just wipe off the dust.
