**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation agents stationed in North-Central Europe[[footnote]] List of countries where SCP-7924 has manifested include: Germany, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, Russia, Ireland, Finland, and The Netherlands. [[/footnote]] are to monitor all rural farms that raise livestock within the family of Bovidae, especially if said fauna is of the subfamily Caprinae. Should females become inexplicably pregnant between the months of November and December, the animal must be taken into Foundation custody until it gives birth.

The population and reproduction habits of wild species of Bovidae in the affected regions must also be closely monitored.

Should any animals give birth to an entity that matches the description or behavior of SCP-7924, SCP-7924 and its mother (SCP-7924-A) must be apprehended as quickly as possible, and all witnesses are to be amnesticized.

Any artifacts that match the description of SCP-7924-B must be stored in a standard anomalous item locker in Site-120 and its previous owner must be amnesticized if possible.
 

**Description:** SCP-7924 is a male humanoid entity that manifests between the dates of December 6th and December 20th. SCP-7924 is always born from females within the family of Bovidae that are no more than 13 months old and have never been pregnant before. These animals, designated SCP-7924-A, will become pregnant through anomalous means independent of any history of mating with males. The gestation period will last for only 9-10 days, nearly 30 times faster than the average non-anomalous pregnancy. Additionally, despite the amount of nutrients and energy required to grow and give birth to an organism the size of SCP-7924, SCP-7924-A suffers little to no negative consequences or health risks from carrying SCP-7924 to term, with a Maternal Death Rate of less than 2%. SCP-7924-A will always give birth to SCP-7924 in a manger on a farm regardless of whether or not SCP-7924-A is domesticated livestock.

SCP-7924 rapidly ages at a rate of approximately 3 years per hour over the course of approximately 24 hours. During this period, SCP-7924&#39;s body will undergo tremendous physical transformations and changes in appearance, personality, behavior, and anomalous properties every 6 hours. Within 25 hours SCP-7924&#39;s life will expire of old age and his body will transmutate into non-anomalous wicker, snow, coal, or hair, forming the shape of SCP-7924&#39;s body at the time of death.

Additionally, SCP-7924 has minor Anti-Memetic Properties. Individuals that are chronologically close to SCP-7924&#39;s physical age will be unable to perceive SCP-7924 until he ages to a form that they can perceive.

Due to the nature of SCP-7924&#39;s anomalous death and self-replication, permanent containment is impossible. 

While accounts and sources vary, records report that SCP-7924 may have existed as early as 500 CE.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Access Addendum-7924-1224: Life Cycle&#34;]]

||~ Age||~ Physical Description||~ Anomalous Properties||~ Behavior||
|| &lt;6 Hours || SCP-7924 has the appearance of an infant or a small child with brown eyes and blonde hair dressed in golden robes wearing a crown. || - Teleportation _
 - Antimemetic properties towards pubescent and prepubescent children under the age of 16. _
 - The ability to materialize food items[[footnote]]Items include oranges, chocolates, peppermint candy, pears, apples, carrots, and dried meats. [[/footnote]] and items made of gold[[footnote]] Items include bells, buckles, coins, pins, and rings. The estimated purity of all items is 10 karats. [[/footnote]] _
 || During this state, SCP-7924 will attempt to teleport into any home occupied by at least one child less than 13 years old and one adult caretaker at least 26 years old. It will do so with the intent of materializing and depositing large quantities of the aforementioned food and gold items in any place used to store children&#39;s clothing such as dressers and closets. If those places are unavailable, SCP-7924 may opt to deposit such substances directly into the footwear and/or the pockets of their clothing. Children within the home are typically the first to discover these items.||
|| 6-11 Hours || SCP-7924 has the appearance of an adolescent or young adult male with yellow eyes and brown hair. Entity always has a long brown beard styled as a goatee regardless of current physical age. SCP-7924 will develop caprine[[footnote]] Formation of Scurs on the side of the head, slight elongation of ears, elongation of lower jaw and nose, and growth of a thin coat of brown fur that covers the torso. [[/footnote]] features and wears a brown mantle, loose-fitting pants, and a fur skin hat. ||- Temporal Manipulation[[footnote]] Capable of anomalously dilating its relationship with time allowing it to move and complete tasks at high speeds. [[/footnote]] _
 - Teleportation _
 - Clairvoyancy _
 - Super Human Strength _
 - Super Human Speed _
 - Super Human Durability _
 - Super Human Metabolism _
 - Antimemetic properties towards adults between the ages of 18 and 37. _
 || Entity will manifest in homes or public spaces that are meant to be used as a place of celebration. The entity will offer anyone in charge or involved in the preparation process to do all their work for them, on the condition that they receive payment.[[footnote]] Payment varies from alcohol, food, monetary payment, rental of livestock including human children, spending time with the commissioner, or &#34;a favor&#34;. The minimum price for SCP-7924&#39;s services has been recorded at $4.28 USD in exact change.[[/footnote]] Through the use of its anomalous properties SCP-7924 is capable of large and complex construction, cleaning, decoration, and/or cooking in a matter of minutes or seconds. Should individuals offered SCP-7924&#39;s services refuse them or otherwise withhold SCP-7924&#39;s Payment, SCP-7924 will use its temporal properties to rob them of their possessions. The stolen goods are often of equal value to the price outlined by SCP-7924.||
|| 12-17 Hours || SCP-7924 has the appearance of a tall, muscular, anthropomorphic caprine with black fur, red eyes, a long and full beard, long ears, cloven hooves, a long tail, and a pair of long caprine horns. The entity is completely naked with the exception of a green and red harness covered in small cowbells and a large sack that it carries on its back. || - Teleportation _
- Telepathy _
- Clairvoyancy _
- Super Human Stregnth _
- Super Human Durability _
- Spatial Manipulation _
- Materialization of a wooden rod _
- Antimemetic Properties towards adults between the ages of 30 and 59. _
 || SCP-7924 will manifest within 40 meters of a pubescent or prepubescent child and will begin to approach them at a walking pace. The sound of bells on SCP-7924&#39;s harness will often alert people to its presence before SCP-7924 is sighted. SCP-7924 will approach the child and upon reaching them will enumerate the child&#39;s various misdeeds within the past year, before manifesting a rod of birch and administering Corporal Punishment. In roughly 5% of these encounters, SCP-7924 will forcibly insert the child into the sack it carries instead of flogging them, at which point the child will be teleported up to one kilometer away from SCP-7924&#39;s current location. Statistically, the odds of this occurring will increase the later SCP-7924&#39;s birth date is in the year. This process is often disorienting for the child who will often have to make their way back home on their own. In this state, SCP-7924&#39;s Anti-memetic Properties will extend to memories of the child&#39;s existence by their closest friends and family until they reach home. There is currently no known history of a child teleported by SCP-7924 dying in the process of getting home and the longest recorded time for return has been 8 days.||
|| 18-24 Hours ||SCP-7924 has the appearance of an elderly man with no anomalous physical features. SCP-7924&#39;s hair is red but will rapidly change to white. SCP-7924&#39;s eyes are green but they will always develop a cataract in his right eye, causing the entity to become half-blind. SCP-7924 will be dressed in a layered red robe and matching hat with blue and white fur trimmings around its neck and sleeves. SCP-7924 may occasionally also wear glasses. ||- Immunity to Extremely Cold Temperatures _
- Telepathy _
- Meteorological Precognition _
- The ability to materialize simple, non-electrical tools and paints _
- Antimemetic properties towards adults over the age of 60. _
 || SCP-7924 will display solitary tendencies, forgoing interactions with humanity in favor of foraging in the wilderness. SCP-7924 will collect wood, stone, and animal bones and will either manifest tools or use its own hands to fashion effigies, totems, and trinkets, most frequently in the shape of an animal. These artifacts are designated SCP-7924-B. Should SCP-7924 encounter any humans after creating an instance of SCP-7924-B, SCP-7924 will give one instance of SCP-7924-B to the human as a gift. As long as the person carries the effigy, they will gain anomalous abilities associated with the item&#39;s symbolism.[[footnote]] Examples: A bone fashioned in the shape of a bird granting the owner hollowed bones. A Snake made from Alderwood periodically reverses the owner&#39;s physical age granting immortality. A wagon that can store the same quantity of items as though it were life-size. A Horse made from stone that greatly increases the owner&#39;s physical stamina.[[/footnote]] In this state SCP-7924 also displays precognitive abilities regarding the weather and climate and will notify anyone about whether or not a snowstorm or blizzard is imminent if it encounters them.||

On December 20th, 1994 a gigantic goat made of straw appeared in Radom, Poland sometime between 01:00-03:00 CET. The structure designated SCP-7924-C subsequently caught fire through unknown means and was burnt to the ground at 06:00 CET. SCP-7924-C structure was hollow and contained numerous instances of SCP-7924-B. While the vast majority of SCP-7924-B instances were incinerated alongside SCP-7924-C, several instances did survive with only minor burns. To date, none of the SCP-7924-B instances found in the wreckage of SCP-7924-C have displayed their usual anomalous properties. The surviving instances of SCP-7924-B recovered from the conflagration include:
* A wooden birdhouse with a chimney
* A 6 oz tumbler made from glass
* 2 avians woven from straw containing anatomically correct bones carved from stone
* A equine figurine carved from a vulpine bone
* A bracelet with a diameter of 5 centimeters made from several non-ferrous metals, segmented by seven spheres of marble.
* A goat weaved from wicker and painted green, red, and gold.

Following the &#34;Scapegoat Incident&#34;, SCP-7924 has ceased manifestations, along with all of its associated phenomena. The remains of the last instance of SCP-7924 have yet to be recovered.
