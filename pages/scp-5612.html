]]

++++ **__Description__**:  
SCP-5612[[footnote]]Designation has been adjusted to reflect the connection to [[[SCP-4612.]]][[/footnote]] is a collective designation for two causally related anomalies.  The investigation into SCP-5612-A led to the discovery and analysis of SCP-5612-B.[[footnote]]Additionally, the events that led to SCP-5612-A&#39;s creation are directly tied to the existence of SCP-5612-B.[[/footnote]]

SCP-5612-A is a small community of homes and businesses colloquially called “Clifton.”  SCP-5612-A was originally located on the coast of Clifton Bay on the island of Nassau, Bahamas.  SCP-5612-A is currently located eight hundred meters west from its original location, along the ocean floor; fully submerged in the water of Clifton Bay.  The condition of the buildings does not match the degradation seen in similar structures exposed to open salt water.  SCP-5612-A exudes residual thaumaturgical energy, radiating from its center.[[footnote]]Given the residual emanations and the fact that the buildings are still standing, it is theorized that the community was physically moved in total, using thaumaturgy.  It is theorized that the wrecked ships (including the //Asmodeus//) were damaged by the movement of the community through them.[[/footnote]]

SCP-5612-A radiates an anti-memetic field stretching outwards roughly fifty meters from the edge of the ruins, erasing knowledge of the anomaly almost instantaneously upon perception.[[footnote]]The effect is such that individuals looking directly at the ruins along the ocean floor do not register their existence.[[/footnote]]

SCP-5612-B is a tubular organic structure measuring ten kilometers long and one kilometer in diameter, buried one hundred meters beneath a mountain range in the area of Alqosh, Iraq.  


++++ **__Analysis of SCP-5612-B**__:

SCP-5612-B is a bio-organic structure; the tissues of which contain multiple organic compounds, including an array of lipids and protein structures inconsistent with any biology registered within the Foundation&#39;s biological database. The organic material of SCP-5612-B’s structure is alive; but functions of many internal components have not yet been determined.  Most chambers within SCP-5612-B average a height of fifteen meters.

SCP-5612-B’s surface is constructed of material consistent with the structure of coral; upon discovery, SCP-5612-B&#39;s surface was sealed airtight and exhibited high resistance to gamma radiation.    

At the head of SCP-5612-B is a conical chamber containing a structure of soft tissues[[footnote]]Most closely resembling the texture of a large fungal organism.[[/footnote]] in a shape resembling a chaise lounge. The chaise is situated directly in front of a series of keratin-like panels with various crystalline structures embedded.  The chaise is over ten meters long and situated three meters in distance from the panels housing the crystalline structures.  When introduced to electrical current the wall of this chamber becomes transparent, without losing any of its structural integrity.  When transparent, the view afforded is 360 degrees of the surrounding area outside of the structure.

Throughout the central portions of SCP-5612-B there are organic pods[[footnote]]Over twenty have been found, each over ten meters in length.[[/footnote]] that are capable of lowering their interior temperatures to negative one hundred and fifty-eight degrees Celsius.

The rear of SCP-5612-B’s length consists entirely of complex organic structures that the Department of Astrophysics believes represent machinery that performs the functions of an [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive | Alcubierre drive]]].[[footnote]]Theoretical engine allowing for the warping of real space to allow for faster-than-light travel.  The scientific community is currently of the opinion that such a device cannot function in the way Alcubierre theorized.[[/footnote]]

++++ **__Discovery__**:
The anti-memetic aspects of SCP-5612-A ensured that it remained undiscovered for the greater part of two centuries.  On 1987-01-21, a Foundation spy satellite was temporarily adjusted to pass over Nassau and noted significant topographical anomalies [[footnote]]Resembling manmade structures.[[/footnote]] on the ocean floor of Clifton Bay.  

A small survey team[[footnote]]Made up of Foundation archaeologists and geologists.[[/footnote]] was dispatched from a nearby facility to examine the sea floor, but noted no anomalies.  Experimentation with memetic enhancement pierced the field around SCP-5612-A.  A survey of the area revealed two dozen buildings built in the style common during the colonial period of the eighteenth century.  Several hundred skeletal remains were discovered within SCP-5612-A, but none were found to have anomalous effects.

Several wrecks of eighteenth-century ships were also found, including the //Asmodeus//, a triple-decker ship-of-the-line in the British Royal Navy style.  The //Asmodeus// was owned and captained by the privateer Geoffrey Watts, a British national living in Clifton from 1791 to 1815.

&gt; //The following is data gleaned from non-Foundation historical databases, and is included for context.// 

Geoffrey Watts was born in 1759, in Yorkshire, England. As the son of a wealthy landowner, his father&#39;s wealth and influence allowed a young Mr. Watts membership in several gentleman’s clubs among the social elite.  In 1778, Watts fled England without explanation to his family.  From 1778 to 1791, Watts’ activities are unknown.

Starting in the early 1790s, a small community of British expatriates[[footnote]]Mostly pirates, sailors and tradesmen.[[/footnote]] still loyal to the British Crown settled in Clifton Bay.  In October 1791, Geoffrey Watts settled in Clifton and secured a Royal Commission from the Governor of Nassau, the substance of which was known only to Watts, the Governor , and King George III.  Watts had //carte blanche// to perform acts of piracy so long as the attacks were on non-English ships and property.   Confidentially, Watts and his crew were to act as the illegal enforcement arm of the Colonial government.  From 1791 to 1815, Watts performed hundreds of acts of piracy aboard the //Asmodeus// and amassed a small fortune.  

According to the Colonial Government’s records, Clifton was destroyed on 1815-09-26 by an earthquake.  Given that the population was mostly sailors, freedmen and women, the government cared little to establish factual descriptions of the damage.  There is a simple notation in the official records that reads: “Clifton – Scoured from the Island by earthquake.”

The event that relocated the community of Clifton to the bottom of the bay is poorly understood, but it is clear from their condition that the buildings have not been damaged by any seismic activity.  Additionally, based on the last entry of Watts&#39; journal, it is likely that this individual had some part to play in the disaster.

-----
Based on the contents of Watts’ journal, and the drawing found within, Dr. Matsouka[[footnote]]Foundation historian and archival specialist.[[/footnote]] started researching monasteries in Iran and Iraq.  After extensive review of the databases, the drawing was confirmed to represent Rabban Hormizd monastery.  The monastery was moved to a new location nearby in 1858, but the original structure still stood as a tourist attraction and historical monument.

Diplomatic Foundation Forces made contact with the Iraqi government in March 1987 and permission was granted for a small expeditionary force to examine the original monastery. The buildings were found to be non-anomalous, but ground penetrating radar revealed the presence of a tubular structure (designated as SCP-5612-B) approximately one hundred meters below the mountains upon which the monastery’s original structure is situated.

Given the placement of SCP-5612-B within the stratification of the mountain range, the anomaly has been present for over two billion years.[[footnote]]Coinciding with the [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxidation_Event | Great Oxidation Event]]].[[/footnote]]
