**Special Containment Procedures:** Both SCP-6493-A and SCP-6493-B are to be contained in a Standard Secure Chest in the storage area of Site-42. Usage of SCP-6493 must be approved by O5-Council [[footnote]]See Addendum-1 for more information[[/footnote]].

**Description:** SCP-6493 is the designation given to two objects:
* SCP-6493-A, a .60-caliber Syrian flintlock pistol of early 19th century make, that provokes both visual and auditory hallucinations to any individual that holds it;
* SCP-6493-B, a collection of --62-- 57 bullets, which display a significantly low internal Hume level[[footnote]]0.1-0.4 Hm.[[/footnote]].

When loaded and shot through SCP-6493-A, any instance of SCP-6493-B will rapidly reach baseline Hume levels, along with the general area of its path and any object that it collides with. When said object is a Reality Bender, or any other ontokinetic entity or object, any effect that the target will be violently dismembered, resulting in the neutralization of its anomalous effects. Although it is hypothetically possible to neutralize the effects without killing the subject, the explosive nature of SCP-6493-B makes it virtually impossible.

SCP-6493 was previously owned by late GOC Strike Team member Louis Laurent. It was purchased by Laurent in Damascus, Syria in the aftermath of a joint GOC-Foundation operation involving the termination of SCP-████. It is currently unknown if SCP-6493 has always been anomalous since its creation, or rather gained its properties after the death of Agent Laurent.

----
**Results:** D-986271 reported hearing a man frenetically crying followed by a loud gunshot after picking SCP-6493-A. D-986271 was not able to shoot the bullet after loading, as the flint mechanism did not respond to the pulling of the trigger.

----
**Results:** D-801718 reported being able to see a toppled chair, and to hear an infant crying while holding SCP-6493-A. D-801718 successfully loaded SCP-6493-A and shot SCP-6493-B toward the Reality Anchor. The Hume level of the area rapidly reached baseline values, and after being perforated by SCP-6493-B, the Reality Anchor stopped working.

After the events of 30/06/2020, an investigation of the Laurent couple was opened. Due to the demands of the GOC over the possession of SCP-6493, a meeting between representatives from both organizations was scheduled for 09/07/2020 in order to settle the dispute. By O5 council order, O5-█, O5-█ and Dr. Eberhardt were chosen as the Foundation&#39;s representatives.

MTF Eta-5 agent Patrick Blake, known to be a long time friend of both Louis Laurent and researcher Jane Ware, was interviewed in order to move forward the investigation effort.

**Dr. Eberhardt:** Good day Agent Blake.
**Agent Blake:** Good day Doctor.
**Dr. Eberhardt:** We are here to talk about the Laurent couple. I was told you were an acquaintance of them, were you not?
**Agent Blake:** Yes... Doctor.

[ //Agent Blake started sobbing// ]

**Dr. Eberhardt:** Hey, everything&#39;s ok. Take your time if you must. 
**Agent Blake:** No, I&#39;m... I&#39;m ok. So, me and Jane were friends back in Middle School. Both my father and her mother were Foundation researchers, so obviously we followed their steps. Her as a researcher, me as a Jäeger Bomber...
**Dr. Eberhardt:** And what about Laurent?
**Agent Blake:** Louis... Louis... He was a strange fellow. Strike Team member, nickname &#39;LAWDOG&#39;; we met in Syria in 2011, during the operation for the termination of SCP-████, are you familiar with that, Doctor?
**Dr. Eberhardt:** Yes, I&#39;m aware.
**Agent Blake:** Good. Jane arrived after the battle, as a field researcher, or something like that. They met in Damascus, she fell for him first. Eventually they started dating, and in 2014 they started living together in ████, after Louis got discharged. A year ago they married and had Lyvia. Oh God, is she ok right now?
**Dr. Eberhardt:** Yes Agent, Lyvia is safe now. Although someone will have to take custody over her.
**Agent Blake:** Is that also going to be decided in that meet up thing?
**Dr. Eberhardt:** Yes. I&#39;ll be attending the &#39;meet up thing&#39; too. I can assure you we won&#39;t let the GOC take her.

[ //silence// ]

**Dr. Eberhardt:** So anyway, you said that Laurent was a &#39;strange fellow&#39;, can you elaborate on that?
**Agent Blake:** Yeah... He was the archetype of the perfect soldier. They always tell us that &#39;a good soldier doesn&#39;t question, they just act&#39;, well Louis took that way too seriously. 
**Dr. Eberhardt:** In what way?
**Agent Blake:** For him, anything said by GOC High Command was devine law. He just... took his duty over anything else. There were rumours back in Syria about him, some thought he was some sort of secret project or super soldier made by the GOC, always obeying order.
**Dr. Eberhardt:** Thank you Agent. Can you tell us more about Jane Ware?
**Agent Blake:** Sure. She always had been interested by her mother&#39;s work, so she put a lot on time in her reasearch. She was the brightest and most kind-hearted person I&#39;ve ever known. And regarding her relationship with Louis, they did truly loved eachother, even though they did sometimes clash, because of the different philosophies of the Foundation and the GOC you see.
**Dr. Eberhardt:** And what about her condition? Did she ever tell you about it?
**Agent Blake:** No, I discovered that Jane was a Reality Bender just a few hours ago. As far as I was told, she herself discovered this just recently. By the way Doctor, was she found in the end?
**Dr. Eberhardt:** I&#39;m not allowed to tell you about the current status of Jane Ware.[[footnote]] At the time of this interview, blood analysis had already confirmed that the dismembered corpse found in the bedroom belongs to researcher Jane Ware.[[/footnote]]
**Agent Blake:** I see... and what about the meeting, what&#39;s that about besides Lyvia?
**Dr. Eberhardt:** I&#39;m sorry, I cannot speak of this either.

[ //Agent Blake started sobbing for about 1 minute// ]

**Dr. Eberhardt:** I... I have another question. Have you ever heard of an antique gun belonging to Laurent?
**Agent Blake:** Uh... Yeah his flintlock, he bought it back in Damascus, why the question?
**Dr. Eberhardt:** It was found in the bedroom, we believe it is connected to the incident.
**Agent Blake:** Oh... I see.
**Dr. Eberhardt:** This concludes the interview. Thank you for the cooperation Agent Blake, you are dismissed.

On 01/07/2020, footage from the security cameras of the Laurent household was obtained; unfortunately, most of it was higly distorted and unusable. It is currently agreed on that researcher Jane Ware&#39;s reality bending effects are the cause of the camera glitch that lead to the disturbance of most of the data.

**__[[size 110%]]GOC-FOUNDATION MEETING REPORT[[/size]]__**
[[&lt;]]
**Foundation representatives:** O5-1, O5-9, Dr. Eberhadrt.
**GOC representatives:** Strike Team General Sang Myeong, Assistant Director &#34;CICERO&#34;, PSYCHE Division Ambassador Lynd H. Libero.
**Date:** 09/07/2020
**Location:** London, UK.
**Subjects discussed:** Ownership of SCP-6493; custody over Lyvia Marie-Claire Laurent.
----
**Results:** An agreement, involving SCP-6493 being officialy recognized by the GOC to be left in the hands of the Foundation, and custody over Lyvia Marie-Claire Laurent being left to be decided by Foundation, was reached.

**Notable exchange from the meeting:**
&gt; **Ambassador Lynd H. Libero:** What we are saying, Doctor, is that Agent Laurent bought the gun while still in service in Syria, and under the GOC&#39;s regulations for agents on duty, anything that they buy in case of their death is either to be given back to the seller, or to be brought under GOC custody.
&gt; **Dr. Eberhadrt:** But that&#39;s the thing, Agent Laurent was not on duty, technically speaking; the operation for the termination of SCP-████ had already been declared ended, therefore Laurent bought SCP-6493 as a private citizen.
&gt; **O5-9:** Ah. You are talking about ownership this, ownership that, but I think you are forgetting something much more important: we have on our hands a murder mistery basically, and who is playing detective? The Foundation, and in an investigation it&#39;s important that the detective has easy access to all possible people, objects and locations that might be linked with the case, so wouldn&#39;t it be beneficial for both parties if the suspected weapon of both the murder and the suicide was kept under the watch of the detectives of the investigation, hence the Foundation?

**Following statements:** As suggested by Dr. Eberhadrt, guardianship of Lyvia Marie-Claire Laurent was given to Agent Patrick Blake.
