&gt; Hello everyone! This is WhiteGuard speaking. I was a reporter until recently, it is August now, and I have been given the role of editor of Site News. From all on the Site News team, we apologize for the delay. The change in management and everyone being busy caused delays in everything. I am however happy to announce that the July edition of the Site News will be out very soon with a brand new team, brand new sections and content, and a brand new look and format.

[[tab Editorial]]
**From the Editorial Desk**

In 2011, an IRC chat operator kicked a user for saying &#34;/v/ is such a pile of insecure one-upping f*ggotry&#34; in conversation, and soon 24-hour banned them for fighting the decision. While the latter action received little pushback per standard policy on sarcastic attitude towards ops, the former action spurred debate on allowing slurs in #site19. No one actively promoted homophobia or other bigotry, but the common opinion excused slurs given they&#39;re &#34;not a harmful slur&#34; or &#34;not directed at anyone&#34;, and &#34;we&#39;re [not] losing much should [someone offended by casual slur usage] leave in a huff of butthurt&#34;.

This came to a head when a user used the same word in conversation, and the 05 thread represented a similar reaction. An admin fiat-allowed their usage, telling dissenters &#34;you may tender your resignation&#34;, and a moderator cried &#34;CENSORSHIP IS NOT OKAY, EVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES&#34;. &#34;By attempting to protect the interests of a group of people, you are imposing your will upon another and limiting their capacity to express themselves,&#34; they said.

That is, expressing themselves by casually using slurs.

Strength, in the internet&#39;s early days, constituted sucking up and lifting your chin at every vile thing you see. //It&#39;s the internet, after all.// One should have expected such heinous occurrences or messages, words and phrases that hurt. &#34;That is a damn fool thing to get offended by on the internet.&#34; Strength, then, represented hiding emotion, excusing vitriol under &#34;comedic&#34; or &#34;nonharmful&#34; pretenses. Attempting to change meant &#34;hypocrisy in the extreme&#34; in the face of the early internet. Clearly this is how strength will be forevermore defined.

3 years later...

Similar arguments and actions emerge in another thread on slurs. Another admin attempts fiating certain actions without consulting others, stating they &#34;will consider [snark against their decision] the next time promotions are made&#34;, though this admin smartly retracts their fiat once receiving such snark. Even another argument on censorship, calling it &#34;a slippery slope&#34; when deciding what to ban, and once again citing that definition of strength. &#34;It&#39;s the internet.&#34;

Yet this does not form the predominant voice. While still not fully modern, the consensus trails towards a brighter and more considerate future. Maybe slur usage //[https://c.tenor.com/YctxttUmGMYAAAAC/forehead-slap-slapping-forehead.gif is]// bad. The thread does not have a definitive conclusion, nor does it need one.

[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dixieland-nightmare-magic-hub I] [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-good-work think] [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4175 it] [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/shaggydredlocks-proposal is] [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/how-to-clean-a-polyester-dress clear] [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/take-it-away-my-darling who] [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wwydftltimd-hub won] [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/jude-s-bizarre-adventure the] [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/protected:scp-2721 battle].

Strength changed. Strength doesn&#39;t mean blindly accepting what goes on around you because it&#39;s &#34;the status quo&#34; or &#34;how it always was&#34; or &#34;the internet&#34;. Strength isn&#39;t letting old habits continue for the sake of old habits. Strength is standing against those traditions. Strength is being yourself when facing hardship. Strength is making active efforts to change the rules, do the right thing, help your fellow human. Strength is taking //pride// in what you know is moral and just. With strength, with pride, you can make a community //change//.

While, in our internet bubble, acceptance becomes much more common, such trends do not continue elsewhere, at times regressing. Strength continues to mean repression and oppression in those spaces. Perhaps, just like the forebears in 2011 and 2014, users can take their strength past the internet, into spaces that need it, and transform definitions. The work and time it requires pays off eventually, and everyone will feel all the more prideful for it.

Happy belated Pride, everyone.

[[tab Staff Team Spotlight]]
**June spotlight:** [http://05command.wikidot.com/anti-harassment-main Anti-Harassment Team]
**Featuring:** LilyFlower
**Interviewer:** MalyceGraves

------

**Interview:**
I want to thank you for taking the time to interview with me about the Anti-Harassment Committee. It&#39;s the most private of all the staff teams, so I&#39;m certain that a lot of our users would love knowing more. Do you mind giving me a brief overview of the team? What role it plays in the staff structure?
&gt; Alright, so, before I start I have to make it clear I can&#39;t share anything confidential, obviously.

Absolutely. I wouldn&#39;t want you to.
&gt; AHT, as in the name, deals with harassment issues on the wiki and related spaces. It&#39;s one of the smallest and least active teams, but when it is active it&#39;s highly important. It&#39;s got an unusual structure because whilst there&#39;s a captain, it&#39;s less traditionally tiered in the way many other teams are
&gt; It&#39;s small and so when we do have to deal with an incident, we all share the burden and the lot of us work together.

I realize that a lot of the stuff you handle is very private, but is there anything you can point at (without revealing anything confidential, of course) that you can identify as an accomplishment?
&gt; One of the biggest things I&#39;d say is an accomplishment is the recent change in how we present bans; the secrecy of the team has always been a bit of a sore point and I think we&#39;ve finally struck the right balance. Plus, any time we can help make the wiki a safer place is always a bonus

&#34;Safer place&#34; can be pretty subjective. How do you define it?
&gt; In this case, by removing predatory/harmful users. It&#39;s not the nicest thing but someone has to do it haha

I know that I appreciate it, and I&#39;m certain I&#39;m not the only one. But, that being said, I&#39;m sure that some of the conversations and situations can be quite stressful. How do you manage your reaction to that stress, as well as having to sift through the pretty awful things I&#39;m sure you sometimes see?
&gt; I think that one comes down to the individual. Not to get into uncomfortable details, but I&#39;ve dealt with quite a few tough situations through my life and I think that experience helps. It&#39;s also important the whole team works together to share the burden of it, so it&#39;s a lot less stress on any one person
&gt; Cases are fairly infrequent, which helps.

I hear that. I&#39;ve also had to face some pretty unpleasant situations, so I can relate to the benefit of having a team around you to help. Is that part of what keeps you on the team? Have you ever truly considered just resigning?
&gt; Honestly? Not really. I like being able to make a difference, and it&#39;s an important job that someone has to do. I&#39;ve been somewhat adjacently involved in a few cases when I first joined the wiki, and it was definately not as well handled or decent as it is now; I don&#39;t want anyone to have to deal with that

We&#39;ve come a long way since those &#34;good ol&#39; days&#34;, haven&#39;t we? I&#39;ve found that, in retrospect, the &#34;good ol&#39; days&#34; rarely are.
&gt; Yeah, it&#39;s weird looking back and realising how long I&#39;ve been around here

How has being a part of AHT impacted the way you view the site? Does it impact how you approach reading site content? Not forum stuff, but the fictional side of things.
&gt; Not too much; I&#39;ve never felt it&#39;s had an impact on site content, as it&#39;s user behaviour we deal with.

That&#39;s good to know. Speaking of site content, and this will be my last AHT question for you, has being on the team impacted your own fiction? The way you tell stories?
&gt; I&#39;d say, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve actually finished a story since joining! That&#39;s mostly been down to me finishing university this past year though, so hopefully I&#39;ll have some more published by the end of the summer

Congratulations! That&#39;s quite an accomplishment, graduating university. In that vein, has being a member of staff (not just AHT) been helpful to you in your real life? We all know how real life can impact our work here, but it isn&#39;t always just one way.
&gt; I think so, stuff like communication and working in teams - all the stuff that looks great on a CV - but yeah. Plus, I&#39;ve made friends through this, which is important.

[[tab Word from Staff]]

**Staff News:**

++++* __New Staffers:__

The [http://05command.wikidot.com/maintenance-and-ancillary-staff-team-main Maintenance team] (MAST) has recruited two new junior staff. Please welcome fabledtiefling and stormfallen!

++++* __Staff Changes:__

Staff&#39;s [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14115866/summer-promos-2021 Summer Promotions] took place this past month. Vivarium, Limeyy, pr0m37h3um, Joreth, and CityToast were all promoted to operational staff, and WhiteGuard was promoted to moderator. Please congratulate all of the newly promoted staff!

Administrator Modern_Erasmus has decided to [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14117619/retiring-at-least-for-now retire] from staff. Whether this will be temporary or permanent, we do not know. Regardless, we appreciate all of the work Erasmus has done for the site and wish them the best in the future.

In lieu of Erasmus&#39; retirement, moderator Stormbreath has become the new captain of the [http://05command.wikidot.com/rewrite-main Rewrite team], and moderators LadyKatie and YossiPossi have become the new co-captains of the [http://05command.wikidot.com/internet-outreach-main Internet Outreach team].

Operational Staff Limeyy has joined the [http://05command.wikidot.com/site-crit-main Site Criticism team] and the [http://05command.wikidot.com/rewrite-main Rewrite team].

Operational Staff Cerastes and Junior Staff CelesteKara have both joined the [http://05command.wikidot.com/maintenance-and-ancillary-staff-team-main Maintenance team].

Moderators cybersqyd and WhiteGuard have both joined the [http://05command.wikidot.com/disciplinary-main Disciplinary team].

++++* __Updates from 05 Command:__

Operational Staff Vivarium proposed the [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14111687/mast-guide-update-tag-guide MAST Guide Update - Tag Guide] which presented a total rewrite of the official guide on tagging. The proposal was met with unanimous support. June 1st

Moderator Croquembouche proposed the [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14114671/authors-pages-update Authors&#39; Pages update] which as the name implied proposed an update to the authors&#39; pages list. With some minor concerns voiced by staff members rectified, the proposal passed without any issue. June 5th

Administrator DrBleep made a statement in regards to [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14117474/change-in-enforcement-of-intrastaff-interactions Change in Enforcement of Intrastaff Interactions]. Admins and captains agreed that change in staff culture requires consistent enforcement of intrastaff interactions in official staff venues. Internal rules for staff channels were updated to reflect that staff spaces are expected to abide by Rule 0 at all times. June 10th

Administrator Dexanote made a [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14129317/statement-on-cerastes-incident statement] regarding a summary of the events collectively known as the “Cerastes Incident”, a miscarriage of the [http://05command.wikidot.com/disciplinary-main Disciplinary team]’s investigative powers in late 2020. Feel free to click on the linked statement for a more in-depth summary of the situation. June 21st

Moderator Yossipossi proposed [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14119169/staffchat-recaps StaffChat Recaps]. This would create a team to watch staff discussion channels both on Discord and IRC and make summaries of any non-trivial events which occur. They will then format these into concise but detailed reports. This was a lengthy discussion, so I won&#39;t be summarizing everything here.

Moderator Yossipossi proposed [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14119955/staffchat-access-to-junior-staff-and-rearrangement-of-staffc Staffchat Access to Junior Staff and Rearrangement of Staffchat Channels] which granted Junior Staff access to staff chat to tackle a litany of issues. The proposal was met with widespread support before being [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14126209/voting-thread-staffchat-access-to-junior-staff-and-rearrange voted] into practice.

Administrator Dexanote brought forward a rules update in the form of [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14127170/rules-update:self-deletions Rules Update: Self-Deletions] where a broadly defined and flexible change in the wording of the self-deletions policy to accommodate for the extremely rare case where we collectively feel that a delay or denial of mass-deletion-of-work is in the better interest of the site or possibly the user. This passed rather unanimously.

+* Q&amp;A:

++++* Q: Can I replace a blurb that you wrote for one of my articles with my own? I&#39;m not satisfied with it.

A: Absolutely. You will always have that option at any point.

++++* Q: I noticed an error/typo/incorrect information and wish to correct it. May I?

A: Sure! If the changes are not limited to your own article(s) and/or are substantial changes across multiple entries, you should post in that month&#39;s discussion page and then make the changes.

++++* Q: I wrote an article and it seems to have stuck. Can I send a blurb of mine to one of the reporters?

A: Yup! It&#39;s much easier if you come to us about it, and it gives you the control over what you want shown on the news page.
