**Item #:** SCP-1516

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-1516 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site 49, furnished with instances of SCP-1516-1. SCP-1516 is to be provided with written words referring to food and nourishment. Under no circumstances is SCP-1516 allowed to interact with written words describing harmful and/or dangerous concepts that may cause damage to the vicinity or the subject itself, or text/inscription based anomalies, including [[[SCP-1672]]], [[[SCP-1889]]], [[[SCP-2140]]]. As per request, SCP-1516 has been allowed to possess an audiobook copy of the Bible.[[footnote]] King James edition. [[/footnote]]

**Description:** SCP-1516 is a living typographical illustration of a human being measuring 1.9 meters in height and 78 kilograms in weight. SCP-1516 has a semi-variable appearance and is composed of ██████ typeface letters and words. Each part of SCP-1516&#39;s anatomy is composed of the Spanish word deformed to fit the shape of that part of the body. SCP-1516&#39;s anatomy is always labeled with the simplest possible term for the body part. When viewed from a closer perspective, SCP-1516&#39;s form will slowly  change its shape to the terms for that part of the  subject&#39;s body (i.e: its legs would be a deformed &#34;leg&#34; word, and arms, chest, face, etc will follow this pattern). This effect continues down to the subcellular level. When examined by electron microscopy  nuclei isolated from SCP-1516 are full linked A&#39;s, T&#39;s, C&#39;s, and G&#39;s linked by the word &#34;sugar&#34;.  While SCP-1516 is aware of this aspect, it appears to be unable to control it in any way.

When SCP-1516 performs any action that would produce a sound,[[footnote]] Included but not limited to: speaking, walking, and interacting with its surroundings. [[/footnote]] it will produce written words and/or onomatopoeias from the source of the sound instead, floating on the air for approximately 5-10 seconds before suddenly vanishing. It is of note that digital audio recorders can register them as sounds,[[footnote]] SCP-1516&#39;s voice is consistent with a male human in his mid-twenties. [[/footnote]] but cameras and other visual recorders may register a visual image of them.

Whenever SCP-1516 enters in direct contact with a single noun written on any suitable surface, said word will detach itself from the paper and will deform to fit a tridimensional and functional object depicting the previous concept of the word (hereby called SCP-1516-1). Instances of SCP-1516-1 share the same physical characteristics with SCP-1516 itself. SCP-1516 is capable of controlling this ability, but is bounded by SCP-1516&#39;s knowledge and understanding of the word, and how complex the concept is. For a full list of SCP-1516&#39;s abilities, see test log-1516.

**Test log-1516:** The following is a list of the experiments conducted to test SCP-1516&#39;s effect on different words at varying situations:

**Word:** &#34;Sofá&#34; (couch)
**Result:** Upon contact, the word suddenly detached itself, grew in size and deformed to form a tridimensional couch. 

**Word:** &#34;Cama&#34; (bed)
**Result:** Similar results as per previous test.

**Word:** &#34;Teléfono&#34; (phone)
**Result:** Upon contact, the word stayed inert. SCP-1516 has claimed that it doesn&#39;t know how a phone works.

**Word:** &#34;Tomate&#34; (tomato), &#34;lechuga&#34; (lettuce) and &#34;cebolla&#34; (onion). 
**Result:** As expected, all the words were effectively turned into SCP-1516-1 instances. Dr ██████ used a standard kitchen knife to prepare a simple salad. When mixed together, they shifted into &#34;ensalada&#34; (salad). When allowed to consume the salad, SCP-1516 was capable of identifying all involved ingredients. 

**Word:** &#34;Vase&#34;
**Result:** No change. SCP-1516 has claimed not to know what the word means.

**Word:** &#34;Vase&#34;. This time, SCP-1516 has been taught about the meaning of the word.
**Result:** Upon contact, the word changed in the usual way. 

**Word:** &#34;Perro&#34; (dog)
**Result:** Upon contact, the sample shifted as expected. When inspected, it did not show any life signs. 

**Word:** &#34;Papel&#34; (paper)
**Result:** The sample stayed inert. SCP-1516 has claimed the word &#34;paper&#34; is immune to its effect.

**Word:** &#34;Una silla rota&#34; (a broken chair)
**Result:** No change. SCP-1516 has claimed it cannot affect anything beyond an isolated[[footnote]] A word written in an individual sheet or paper of at least 3x3cms. [[/footnote]] word at once.

**Addendum:** SCP-1516 was discovered on  ███████, Venezuela. Following several reports of a &#34;man made of letters&#34; living in an abandoned house on the mountain. Foundation agents were dispatched to investigate and confirmed the situation. SCP-1516 offered no resistance to capture. Witnesses were interviewed and treated with A-class amnestics. Forty-seven (47) instances of SCP-1516-1 were found on the vicinity and confiscated.

**Interview log:** 

&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-1516.
&gt;  
&gt; **Interviewer:** Agent Vasquez.
&gt;  
&gt; **Foreword:** First interview following SCP-1516&#39;s capture. Translated from original Spanish. Subject appears to be calm and willing to cooperate. 
&gt;  
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt;  
&gt; **Vasquez:** Please state your name and nature.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1516:** I am Palabra Quintero. Nothing but a man in this universe.
&gt; 
&gt; **Vasquez:** I see. How long do you remember being in your current state?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1516:** I&#39;ve been like this since I was born. Dad took care of me since I was a child.
&gt; 
&gt; **Vasquez:** Where is your father right now? Was he like you? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1516:** I don&#39;t know. He told me one day his job was done and let me on my own. And no, he was more like you. At least, our creator is always watching us, so I never felt truly alone.
&gt; 
&gt; **Vasquez:** What do you mean?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1516:** I mean we are being observed. They watch over us most of the time. Constantly reading our actions in this universe.
&gt; 
&gt; **Vasquez:** Who is this creator? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1516:** He is God. Or should I say they are God? It doesn&#39;t really matter, because God is always reading us. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Vasquez:** Do you mean watching us?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1516:** Well, it&#39;s all a matter of perspective. In my eyes, and in their eyes, we are just all the same thing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Vasquez:** I see. Any additional information regarding your father?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1516:** He was a lovely man, but he had problems focusing in a single subject. Nothing more to say.
&gt; 
&gt; **Vasquez:** Now, what can you tell about the objects we found on your residence?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1516:** Those are words I took from some children books my dad gave to me some years ago.
&gt; 
&gt; **Vasquez:** When you say you take them, do you mean physically remove a word from the paper?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1516:** More or less. It&#39;s like grabbing an object from a bag. Although some words are really heavy to lift. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Vasquez:** What is the... Most heavy word you ever tried to manifest?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1516:** I tried a tree once. It just didn&#39;t move at all.
&gt; 
&gt; **Vasquez:** I think that&#39;s enough information for now. We will move you to a new residence soon.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1516:** May God bless your tales, brother.
&gt;  
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt;  
&gt; **Closing Statement:** SCP-1516 hasn&#39;t given any additional information regarding its &#34;father&#34; or its &#34;creator&#34;. Further investigations on these matters are pending.

**Addendum:** At ████/██/██ SCP-1516 was approved to receive English classes 3 times a week. Due to the apparent lack of difference between oral and written communication, the subject showed a remarkable advance during courses. 10 weeks after the classes started, SCP-1516&#39;s body presented an irregularity when several body samples showed 12% of the total mass to be written in regular English. English course was suspended and several tests were run on SCP-1516&#39;s body. SCP-1516 expressed no physical discomfort for this event and requested to continue its English classes. After several discussions, SCP-1516 was allowed to continue its classes. At week 14 body mass changed into English had been increased to 20% and confirmed that English transmutation was directly proportional to SCP-1516&#39;s English skills. At week 37, SCP-1516 reached perfect use of English language and English transmutation stopped at 48% of its body mass. No objective secondary effects were visible, but a slight change in SCP-1516&#39;s personality has been noted connected to the language it uses to communicate.[[footnote]] It appears to be more extroverted when using English language.
