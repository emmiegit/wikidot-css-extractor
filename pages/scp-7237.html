**Item #:** SCP-7237


**Special Containment Procedures: Scp-7237 is to be contained in a 5m x 5m metal room. There may not be any way of looking inside the containment cell. When entering containment chamber, one must wear goggles as to protect from accidentally making eye contact.** 

Description: Scp-7237 is a floating eye, which seems to lack a pupil. Despite this, it can still observe it&#39;s surroundings. The eye is about the size of a large dog. If eye contact is made, whoever made eye contact goes through an experience called &#39;Universal Enlightenment&#39;, which causes them to learn everything about the universe. It has been made clear that when one is put through Universal Enlightenment, they forget all memories, as they are smothered by the knowledge of everything. When one is in the state, they become Scp-7237-1. They try to spread this information, through a symbol that is impossible to decipher. If this is symbol is pronounced, or seen via writing, they will also go through Universal Enlightenment. As time goes on, they become more and more aggressive, until they succumb, and try to end their own life. It takes about thirty minutes until they succumb. If they are unable to end their life, they will start going through another process, called &#39;Universal Transfiguration&#39;. After about five minutes after the designated thirty minutes, they will stop whatever they&#39;re doing, and will start standing still. After about 7 - 10 minutes, they will tear their own flesh off, revealing one eye that resembles the entity Scp-7237, becoming Scp-7237-2. They will do the same thing as Scp-7237, though researchers have seen that they are flammable, making them less resistant than Scp-7237.


In case Any cases of Scp-7237-1 are seen outside containment, here are protocols for re-containment. All Chaos Insurgency will wear noise cancelling headphones, as to stop any sort of hearing of the symbol.  All Chaos Insurgency are to carry a large bottle of Amnesia-causing pills.


**Addendum: Amnesia does work, but it gets rid of all main memories, such as family, friends, children, etc. Amnesia Inducing pills does not affect anyone past the 15 minute mark.**

**Cases of Scp-7237-1 have a pure white pupil, unable to walk straight, and they seem tired.**
