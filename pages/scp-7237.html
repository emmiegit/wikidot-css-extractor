**Item #:** SCP-7237

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7237 is to be stored in a secured, opaque container in a high-security locker at Site-47. Access to SCP-7237 for testing purposes requires prior authorization from at least two Level 4 personnel. Direct physical interaction with SCP-7237 is to be conducted only by D-class personnel under strict supervision.

SCP-7237&#39;s containment chamber is to be lined with non-reflective, soundproof materials to prevent accidental exposure of personnel to its effects. Electronic devices and any form of printed or digital literature are strictly forbidden within a 30-meter radius of SCP-7237&#39;s containment area.

**Description:** SCP-7237 is a small, ornate quill pen, dating back to the early 19th century. When SCP-7237 is brought into proximity (within approximately 1 meter) of any narrative-based text, it induces a range of alterations in the content of the text. These alterations are not observed in SCP-7237 itself, but in the text it is used to influence.

Alterations caused by SCP-7237 include:

- Reversing the conclusion of narratives, changing positive outcomes to negative and vice versa.
- Shifting the genre of the story (e.g., from comedy to tragedy).
- Modifying names of characters and locations, often aligning them with the altered thematic elements of the story.

The effects of SCP-7237 are permanent and do not revert once the object is removed from the vicinity of the affected text. SCP-7237&#39;s influence extends to both printed and digital media, including ebooks and audiobooks.

**Addendum 1 - Recovery Log:** SCP-7237 was recovered from an estate sale in [REDACTED], England, after reports surfaced of a series of books from the estate library having their content inexplicably altered. Foundation agents secured SCP-7237 and administered amnestics to all involved parties.

**Addendum 2 - Incident Report 7237-2A:** In a controlled experiment, SCP-7237 was placed near a copy of Charles Dickens&#39; &#34;A Tale of Two Cities.&#34; The narrative was altered to depict a utopian ending, with significant changes to character arcs and plot points. The experiment confirmed the extent of SCP-7237&#39;s anomalous effects on narrative structures.

**Addendum 3 - Ethics Committee Review:** Due to the potential implications of its effect on historical and culturally significant texts, SCP-7237 has been classified as a potential threat to the integrity of literary works. Proposals for its use in psychological operations have been rejected, and research is currently focused on understanding the mechanism behind its anomalous properties.</textarea></pre>
