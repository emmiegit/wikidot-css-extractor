**Item #:** SCP-3939

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3939 is currently kept at Site-39 in pre-containment holding cell C (39-PC01-C). When not in testing it is to be kept in a standard containment locker of appropriate size.

SCP-3939 is to be removed from pre-containment as soon as possible.

**Description:** SCP-3939 is a gramophone, or record player, of unknown date of origin but consistent with design and manufacturing trends of the 1930s. It has an octagonal wooden base constructed of polished mahogany and is imprinted with the logo of HMV at the time. Atop this base is a turntable which is connected to the gramophone mechanism and a large brass horn. All components are in good condition.

SCP-3939 currently has a black vinyl record on the turntable, which is turning at a standard rate despite no visible source of power.

Further examination is pending.

[[div class=&#34;story&#34;]]
You pack your things, leave the Site, head to the car park, drive out of the gate and make your way home. Traffic is pretty light so you get home in a very timely manner. You read for a while, make yourself penne carbonara — it&#39;s mediocre — and then you go to bed.

In the morning, you get up, take a shower, shit, put on clothes, eat toast, and leave. Traffic is heavy on the way to Site-39 — apparently there was a crash yesterday, and the queues are still clearing up. You must have gotten home before it happened. You drive through the security checkpoint, get let in, park your car, and head to your office.

Not two minutes later — you&#39;ve not had time to mentally prepare yourself for today, even — there&#39;s a knock at your door. You open it up to see the face of Junior Researcher Sally Hawthorne.

&#34;Dr. ████████.&#34; she says.

&#34;Sally.&#34; you reply. &#34;Is everything okay?&#34;

&#34;Yes, sir, of course.&#34; The speed at which she speaks — as well as the fact that she&#39;s stood at your door in the first place — reveals her lie. &#34;Well, actually... have you seen Dr. Rodriguez today?&#34;

&#34;Carlos?&#34; You think back. &#34;Not since yesterday, no. Why do you ask?&#34;

&#34;He was supposed to be here an hour ago.&#34; She steps into your office completely, and pulls the door shut behind her. &#34;We had some work that needs doing. I&#39;ve not been able to contact him at all this morning.&#34;

&#34;I&#39;ve not heard from him, no.&#34; A stern look takes over your expression. &#34;Sally, be completely honest with me. All work on SCP-3939 goes through me, and there&#39;s nothing to be done on it before I came in today. Tell me why you needed to meet with him.&#34;

She makes eye contact with you. &#34;Romantic relations, sir. I&#39;ll cut it off immediately.&#34;

Your mind goes numb. You push away thoughts of family, and let your mental autopilot reply. &#34;Sally, you&#39;re an adult, you can do what you want. Everyone comes from somewhere. Just don&#39;t let it interfere with your work.&#34;

&#34;No, we&#39;re not planning on...&#34;

She stops, and blushes at what she was about to say. Without a further word, and under your gaze, she leaves your office. You sigh, and take a seat at your desk.

It takes you a moment to remember what you&#39;re supposed to be doing today. You&#39;ve got to take a closer look at SCP-3939 to see if you can work out what&#39;s actually anomalous about it.
