##FF0000|I asked them where I was. Who they were.##
##teal|They told me they were the Foundation. That where I was didn&#39;t matter. ##


Shards. Shards inside my skin, shards inside my head. Everything was broken, breaking. They were breaking me apart.



##teal|They said they were trying to understand me.##
##FF0000| But I didn’t understand them.##



 Should I have known? What should I have been thinking? What thoughts did they want me to think, to stop them from turning me to shreds of myself. 


##FF0000|I asked them where their humanity went.##
##teal|They told me humanity doesn&#39;t hear about this.##


I tried to think, I tried to bring something to the surface they’d listen to, something to stop the knives. 



 [[span style=&#34;color:FF0000;&#34;]]I told them my name is Juliet.[[/span]]

 [[span style=&#34;color:teal;&#34;]]They told me my name is H497.[[/span]]



But that’s not a name, is it? Did I dream of having a name? I couldn&#39;t remember how long I’ve been here, or who I was before. I saw flashes of colour when I close my eyes, but when I open them I saw the grey walls and static. 


[[span style=&#34;color:#FF5858;&#34;]]I told them I want to go home.[[/span]]

[[span style=&#34;color:teal;&#34;]]They told me I don’t have a home.[[/span]]


But I remembered a home. I was warm then. I forgot what that warmth feels like, but I longed for it. That’s something I did remember. They refused it, refused the one memory I knew wasn’t a dream.



[[span style=&#34;color:teal;&#34;]]They told me I was diseased, that I was missing the thoughts in my brain. They have to inspect me. [[/span]]

 [[span style=&#34;color:#FF5858;&#34;]]I told them they took parts of my skin, asked them if they’re the disease.[[/span]]

[[span style=&#34;color:teal;&#34;]]They didn’t like that[[/span]].

so I think we’re even.

But they’re right. I don’t remember what my hands used to look like, and I don’t remember this static. I don’t mind it though, it helps. They had cut into me, trying to remove the parts that are still there. The static clings to me anyways, insulating me from the pain. I don’t feel what’s missing anymore. At first, I felt the knives, now I don’t. I still don’t like them, but they come anyways. I woke up, once, being prodded in a dim room. 



[[span style=&#34;color:teal;&#34;]]They said that they wanted to remove the static, so they removed parts of me.[[/span]]

[[span style=&#34;color:#FF7070;&#34;]]I said that I don’t mind, the static took the place of what went missing.[[/span]]



Sparkling like fireworks of black and white. It kept me safe from the pain. Kept me numb. 


[[span style=&#34;color:#FF8383;&#34;]]I used to tell them I was human, that I deserved to be treated like one.[[/span]]

[[span style=&#34;color:teal;&#34;]]They would tell me I’m barely alive, that I’m not worth the effort.[[/span]]


It gets dim, the lights. The light is reaching me less and less now. But I don’t mind, the static keeps me safe. 

I wanted to lay my head down, for now. For a while. To try to think of words to say that would make them release me. 

Now, I can lay my head down anyways. There’s no point to the thoughts, the static takes their place, warms my brain. I feel its warmth, is this what… what home felt like? 



 [[span style=&#34;color:#FF8383;&#34;]]I asked the static if it was my home.[[/span]]

 [[span style=&#34;color:slategray;&#34;]]That warmth, the tingling was its answer.[[/span]] 


The numbness that felt so welcoming. 


I can hear voices, they feel so far away. Were they getting their knives? It didn’t matter, really I didn’t care.


##teal|They call me a failure. ##


[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3234  A new voice among them calls me a victim.] 


I can’t see them. The static hides the world from me. It protects me, and I don’t mind. 

Their voices get louder, fighting each other. then they fall, hushed and fading to static. 


The tingling begins to go away. The warmth, gets hotter. 

I try to open my mouth, to speak, to breathe, but my throat is filled with static. I don’t mind, it’s keeping me safe.
