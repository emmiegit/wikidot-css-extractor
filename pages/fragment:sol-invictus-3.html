----

Prim was the first to step out of the elevator, holding Astia’s hand before she could elaborate further. Sheldon stepped out second and saw that there was only one table on this floor, which seated the only guest in the room. Mammon Istjur Ansiel.

Sheldon&#39;s could feel his heart race and eyes widen as he finally saw his date for the first time. Ansiel was tall, perhaps slightly taller than Primrose. He was humanoid, but had insectoid features and wings that were reminiscent of a fly. He presented extremely femininely, and wore a suit jacket with nothing underneath but a leather pentagram harness which drew Sheldon&#39;s eye directly to Ansiel&#39;s chest.

Sheldon suddenly felt very thankful that he didn&#39;t appear to him as an over the hill law school professor with an awful moustache.

Ansiel stood up from the table and approached them. &#34;Primrose! It&#39;s good of you and the family to finally come.&#34;

[[f&gt;image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/sol-invictus/HotFlySupposedlyDressedUP.png style=&#34;width:330px;&#34;]]
Sheldon was mesmerized by how Ansiel moved, the intermittent buzzing of his transparent wings, the way his hips swayed, the subtle bounce as his sharp heels clicked against the marble floor.

&#34;And, of course,&#34; Ansiel stood in front of him now, smiling and extended his hand out. &#34;...I&#39;m //very// happy to see you again, Mr. Katz. I&#39;ve been waiting to meet you off-hours for some time now. Hopefully the feeling is mutual?&#34;

He was so close to him now. When Sheldon saw the fly form Ansiel took he had expected him to smell of stale blood and rotting flesh. Of decay and death. Instead Ansiel smelled of... flowers. Fresh, fragrant flowers. Like a meadow during the Spring. That floral smell lingered strongly around Ansiel, from the top of his head to the curls at the bottom of his hair, to his neck and clavicle, down to his chest and towards his-

&#34;Sheldon, my eyes are up here.&#34; Ansiel said sweetly, gently tilting Sheldon&#39;s head upwards to meet his eyes.

Sheldon Katz could only blush a deep red as he realized he had been ogling at him this whole time.

&#34;I- I- um-&#34; he stammered, trying his best to regain his composure. &#34;Y-Yes, the feeling is mutual, I&#39;m happy to see you too... Ansiel.&#34;

&#34;Oh yes, I can tell, Sheldon.&#34; Ansiel giggled softly, his gentle laughter felt like music to Sheldon&#39;s ears. His voice was as sultry and husky as Primrose had imitated prior.

Sheldon wondered briefly if Adrian and Prim had been wrong about Ansiel not being a succubus.

&#34;Alright, Alright, Moneybugs,&#34; Adrian smirked behind them. &#34;We got time for that mushy stuff later. Right now, we gotta //eat.//&#34;

&#34;//Ita//, I don&#39;t know about you but I&#39;m famished.&#34; Astia licked her lips as everyone took their seats. &#34;Oh, Sheldon, you should have the voidhorse entrails. It&#39;s simply to die for!&#34; She suggested.

Oh, right, he was supposed to eat something. Katz hummed as he opened the menu. He ran his fingers across the almost too smooth surface of the menu and thought about the contract Ansiel had produced for him years ago. He wondered if this too was made out of human skin.

&#34;...Not to be rude but I may have to pass up on that. I also don&#39;t know if anything here is… safe for me.&#34; Sheldon rubbed his chin and worried briefly if asking for a kosher dinner would come across as //culturally insensitive// in Hell.

&#34;We thought ahead on that as well,&#34; Prim began. &#34;the food -at least for your meal specifically- will be perfectly fit for human consumption. It also will not come from a sapient life form, kill you, keep you trapped in Hell forever, etcetera.&#34;

&#34;And also, I may have helped a smidge…&#34; Ansiel smiled, &#34;And while I know you aren&#39;t Jewish in the religious sense, I had the chefs prepare something special for you. They have the whole front half of a cow, a Japanese Black from the //Matsusaka// region and rated //A5//, ritually slaughtered with strict accordance to the //Kashrut// and ready to cook however you want.&#34;

&#34;Wait. How did you- you got a kosher meal... //here?//&#34; Sheldon raised an eyebrow. Impressed that Ansiel not only managed to get kosher food in Hell but a whole half a cow&#39;s worth of the most expensive and highest possible rated Japanese Wagyu money could ever buy.

//Wait...// Sheldon suddenly thought. //Japanese Wagyu had never been prepared kosher before, only American Wagyu.//

While American Wagyu was already a luxury to him, the thought of biting into authentic Japanese Wagyu, let alone the most absurdly expensive version of it, was always something of a distant fantasy for him. The fact that Ansiel had not only produced half an entire cow but somehow had it prepared kosher astounded him.

&#34;I had to pull a few strings, call in a few favors, maybe threaten a few people but it wasn&#39;t //too// difficult.&#34; Ansiel smiled proudly. &#34;I may be greedy but I&#39;m not //selfish//, I want you to have a nice dinner too, Sheldon.&#34;

&#34;I... Wow, that&#39;s incredibly thoughtful of you, Ansiel.&#34;

&#34;Well, of course, I think about you a lot, Sheldon.&#34; Ansiel said, his voice sounding as sweet as sugar. &#34;I know //quite a bit// about you...&#34;

Ansiel continued, &#34;Like for instance, I knew that turning into your law professor would be a good mind game all those years ago.&#34;

Sheldon&#39;s eyes widened, &#34;...So that&#39;s why you did that, I always figured it was you attempting to throw me off my game and not... well...&#34;

&#34;You being secretly attracted to a law school professor with a //spectacularly// awful moustache the size of a small, ugly dog?&#34;

Like a lightening bolt, the intrusive mental image of Professor Kopylov appeared in his mind, topless with nothing but Ansiel&#39;s leather harness on. Kopylov&#39;s mental apparition smiled, winked and made his greasy moustache wiggle like a very hairy caterpillar.

Sheldon could only grimace and turned his eyes to look away. &#34;I- Well-&#34;

&#34;Sorry, sorry! I couldn&#39;t help but tease.&#34; Ansiel giggled, a good natured giggle that sparkled and managed to put Sheldon at ease. &#34;Honestly, and I mean this as a compliment, I don&#39;t think there was much else I could have done to tempt you.&#34;

Sheldon adjusted his bow tie slightly and felt the gentle sting of embarrassment. Well, if Ansiel wanted to tease then two could play this game.

He smiled as he thought of the perfect thing to say. &#34;Oh, I don&#39;t know about that, I&#39;m sure a //succubus// like yourself could think of something.&#34;

Anisiel&#39;s eyes nearly popped out of his head as he heard Sheldon say that. His shoulders tensed, his wings flared out and buzzed involuntarily. All the Archdemon could do was to make a sound that was somewhere in-between a strangled scream and choked laugh.

&#34;UM-&#34; Ansiel began to say but couldn&#39;t finish. Sheldon couldn&#39;t help but laugh as he felt more than a little proud of himself that he could make an Archdemon //embarrassed.//

He saw that Ansiel had folded his legs together and begun to fidget, his hand reached up to the gold hoop of his leather collar and tugged at it absent mindedly.

//...That... was embarrassment... right?// was what Sheldon thought to himself.

Ansiel&#39;s face was nearly peach pink and behind those red fractal sunglasses Sheldon and Ansiel&#39;s eyes met. Ansiel didn&#39;t look embarrassed exactly...

No, it wasn&#39;t embarrassment in Ansiel&#39;s eyes at all. Only a raw desire, an almost animal need. Pure, uncut lu-

//&#34;Ahem,// gentlemen,&#34; Primrose said, &#34;I hate to interrupt but...&#34;

&#34;O-Oh yes, right, dinner.&#34; Sheldon snapped out of it and looked back to his menu, more flustered than he had been prior. Ansiel likewise re-adjusted his wings and pushed his glasses back up, wiping a beat of sweat from his forehead.

Sheldon cleared his throat, &#34;In that case, I think I will have... Set B, the Wagyu steak with the egg fried rice, garlic and truffles. For drinks I&#39;ll have whatever&#39;s on the tap.&#34;

&#34;Apologies, sir, we don&#39;t have a tap.&#34; A waitress manifested behind him, walking into view. Sheldon wasn&#39;t quite sure what kind of demon she was. A black sheep, evidently. &#34;We have Babalon&#39;s Orchard hard cider, Brimstone™ chocolate liquor, a year zero Muscaria Brandy, and numerous wines of the blood, red, and white variety.&#34;

&#34;Oh! Uh… I&#39;ll have the Hard Cider.&#34; Sheldon paused for a moment as he registered that name, //Babalon,// he turned to Primrose, who sat next to him. &#34;Wait, that was your Mother&#39;s name correct?&#34;

&#34;You are, indeed, correct,&#34; Primrose said with a polite nod. &#34;If you see a company bearing my Mother&#39;s name, chances are I have my hand in it.&#34;

&#34;Do... you //own// this company?&#34;

&#34;I would not say I own it,&#34; Primrose continued. &#34;But, I am a majority shareholder, and was able to rename the company once Therion&#39;s name had been denounced //thoroughly.// I think you will enjoy it.&#34;

&#34;Excellent choice. And the rest of you?&#34; The waitress asked, before diligently taking everyone&#39;s orders. Sheldon was sure that everyone else&#39;s orders contained some kind of people-meat.

But not Ansiel&#39;s. His meal was a salad and small serving of egg rolls. &#34;You know what&#39;s really special about this restaurant, Sheldon? Aside from it being a propriety of the Mammon Family, that is.&#34;

&#34;I don&#39;t. Please, enlighten me.&#34; Sheldon leaned in a smidge, just enough so that his date could see his interest for himself.

The dark angel paused for a second, but kept the suave façade going. &#34;You get dinner AND a show.&#34;

It was as if on cue, the minotaur chef emerged from the back, pushing a cart full of ingredients to the countertop opposite to the dinner guests. In a rare event, Sheldon&#39;s eyes lit up.

He&#39;d been to //Teppanyaki// restaurants on earth before once or twice, though only for special occasions; office celebrations for Tactical Theology after negotiating difficult, important deals. Getting drunk with Primrose and Adrian and chewing into a thick slab of American Wagyu was cathartic after having to deal with the Infernal Revenue Service and //fucking Marion.//

&#34;Dear lord, you guys thought of everything,&#34; Katz smiled as their waitress began pouring their drinks. &#34;I can tell you jumped through a lot of hoops for this dinner. For my sake, no less... Thank you. I really appreciate everything you did to make this night happen.&#34;

&#34;Of course, dear.&#34; Ansiel folded his hands together, the buzz of his voice almost like a sweet, rumbling purr to Sheldon&#39;s ear. &#34;A man of your caliber deserves the very best the Mammons have to offer.&#34;

It was no sooner than he said that that the clanging of metal on metal rang out through the room. The chef spun his spatulas together in his hands, each collision giving off a small shower of sparks, eventually leading to the countertop igniting, briefly. The chef must have oiled the grill prior to starting the show.

Sheldon&#39;s dinner was the first to cook, likely to avoid contamination.  The bull covered the Wagyu in juust enough salt to cure it, but not enough to taint the flavor. After all, such a prime cut was better prepared as pure as possible. What Sheldon didn&#39;t expect was the chef to flip the steak several feet in the air, hit it with a fireball, and catch it on his spatula before flipping it again to dice it into several, perfect evenly cut strips mid-air.

What transpired after that was a whirlwind of ingredients, and various meats of an origin that would be considered more dubious in Sheldon&#39;s eyes.  Yet, aside from the egg fried rice that most of the party also had, his meal never once touched the others&#39;. Frankly, the display was mesmerizing.

Sheldon looked over to gauge the others&#39; reactions. Astia was practically drooling, only being pulled out of her hunger-induced trance by her partner not-so discreetly sneaking a kiss in. Both women, of course, were wagging their tails at a breakneck pace.

Adrian was leaning their head against Morningstar&#39;s chest, not even trying to be subtle. &#34;I love you so much, you big beautiful himbo.&#34;

&#34;Love you too, puppy.&#34; Morningstar cooed, scritching Adrian&#39;s head, focusing around the base of their horns in particular.

Then, his date. Ansiel was taking a sip of his cider when he noticed the human sneaking a glance. Normally, Sheldon would&#39;ve looked away and pretend he wasn&#39;t looking. But something possessed him to whisper. &#34;You know, it&#39;s kind of unfair.&#34;

&#34;Hm? What is?&#34; Ansiel questioned, his wings almost shivering.

&#34;You arrange this... spectacular display... And I can&#39;t even pay attention to the food.&#34;

&#34;Display? What do you... O-oh! //Oh my.&#34;// Ansiel blushed. He didn&#39;t know why such a compliment was making him feel this way, but he couldn&#39;t just //NOT// return the favor. &#34;You look very handsome yourself.&#34;

&#34;Really? I&#39;m glad you think so.&#34; Sheldon smiled and placed his hand on the table.

&#34;Oh, I know so. In fact...&#34; Anseil leaned in tantalizingly close, enough to whisper, and placed his own hand on Sheldon&#39;s...
