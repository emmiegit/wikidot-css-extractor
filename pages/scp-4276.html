**Item #**: SCP-4276

**Object Class**: Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures**: All instances of SCP-4276 are to be held collectively within a glass observation chamber, and smoke exhalers are to be embedded within each corner, allowing quick neutralization and dispersion of the colony. Instances are to be fed a 250g mix consisting of 70% fruit and 30% dead insects, primarily small spiders, and ants, 4 times a week. No species larger than a common mouse are to be fed to SCP-4276. SCP-4276 is to be observed twice a month for any signs of colony growth, in which case, mandatory culling is to take place through smoking of all instances containment chamber and extracting excess occurrences. Only 20 instances of SCP-4276 are to remain alive at one time.

Any testing of SCP-4276 must be performed by level-3 personnel or higher, moreover, it must first be approved by level-4-4276 personnel assigned to instance containment. Any staff who interact with SCP-4276 must allow themselves to be subject to an MRI scan, medicinal treatment, and pyrethroid cleanse at any moment. Any and all recreational audio-visual appliances are to remain outside of SCP-4276&#39;s containment. In case of a containment breach, all instances are to be terminated and the site is to be placed into lockdown. It is unknown if the entirety of SCP-4276 has been contained.

**Description**: SCP-4276 is a tribe of insects descending from the family of Chrysididae [[footnote]] More specifically the tribe Chrysidini. [[/footnote]], more commonly known as cuckoo wasps. SCP-4276 is nearly physically indistinguishable with its non-anomalous counterparts,[[footnote]]including kleptoparasitic breeding habits and structural coloration. [[/footnote]] save for the possession of a greater diversity for vibrancy amongst its families, allowing varied shades of green, blue, pink, red, yellow, magenta. Certain cases of SCP-4276 experience a significantly longer period of growth than non-anomalous species, ranging from 1.2 cm (0.5 inches) to upwards of 8.1cm (3.2 inches). SCP-4276 possesses an ovipositor to assist in egg insemination, although replacing the functionality of a stinger. Male instances appear to lack both.

SCP-4276 is for the most part identical in behavior to their non-anomalous counterparts, save for an apparent quirk of newborn wasps to create &#39;colonies&#39; near hatching points. Newborn SCP-4276 instances also appear to mature especially quickly, as most natural births take place after about 3 days, compared to a full week. SCP-4276 does not appear to prefer eggs to host their larvae in[[footnote]] As opposed to their non-anomalous counterparts, which are notorious for infesting spider dens. [[/footnote]], rather introducing its larvae to both living and freshly killed animals. SCP-4276 has been discovered having infected:
* (4) //White-Tailed Deer.//
* (2) //Desert Cottontail.//
* (1) //Red Fox, observed consuming a Cottontail.//
* (1) //Black Bear.//
* (1) //German Shepard.//
* (4) //Human males.//
**Discovery**: SCP-4276 was first discovered 8km east of Oak Creek, Colorado after 4 individuals (henceforth designated POI-4276-1 through 4) were reported missing. One such individual was a Jebidiah Carswell [[footnote]] POI-4276-1. [[/footnote]], an avid hunter, community spokesman, and known associate of [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4810 | The Board of the Highest Huntsman]]]. Foundation agents found that Mr. Carswell had recently purchased a hunting cottage near Stagecoach State Park, and had emailed a select few of his colleagues to meet him that weekend. Foundation agents were successful in obtaining Mr. Carswell&#39;s property records and quarantined the cottage, which had become infested with SCP-4276. Mr. Carswell had allegedly scheduled a hunting trip for his colleagues and, after a failed night of searching, decided to celebrate instead. MTF Lambda-12 was dispatched.

**Exploration Video Log Transcript**

**Date: 1999/03/13 — 06:30 am**

**Exploration Team**: MTF Lambda-12 (&#34;Pest Control&#34;)

**Team Lead**: Lambda-1 (&#39;Lanie&#39;)

**Team Members**: Lambda-2(&#39;Colin&#39;), Lambda-3 (&#39;Jameson&#39;), Lambda-4 (&#39;Alan&#39;)

**Note**: MTF Lambda-12 agents are equipped with modified smoke blowers strapped to their backs as well as a sidearm.

00:00—(//Personal body cams are switched to active, revealing agents stacked up on the cottage door.//)

00:10—(//Lambda-4 casts a smoke grenade into the entryway as agents disperse within the room.//)

00:20—(//Smoke clears and POI-4276-2 is visible laying adjacent to the door face down.//)

**Lambda-1**: Search the building. Remember protocol.

00:35—(//Lambda-1 investigates POI-4276-2. Hoisting up the body reveals what appears to be numerous wounds in his back, resembling holes.//)

00:40—(//Lambda-3 likewise discovers POI-4276-3 and a German Shepherd in the kitchen area. POI-
4276-3&#39;s chest is visible having been opened outwards from the sternum. The canine[[footnote]] Recovery of a collar proposed the dog&#39;s name as &#39;Ringo&#39;. Evidence supports relationship as POI-4276-1&#39;s companion. [[/footnote]] appears relatively intact save for a cavity in its head.//)

**Lambda-3**: dog and a POI, still no sign of an anomaly.

**Lambda-1**: Roger, continue search. Lambda-2, copy?

01:00—(//At the same time as Lambda-1&#39;s transmission, Lambda-2 opens the bathroom door. POI-4276-4 is discovered stooped inside of the bathtub, his innards having been spilt into the tub due to an immense opening in their abdomen. A large number of SCP-4276 are present and begin droning loudly.//)

**Lambda-2**: —Oh fuck. Bathroom!

1:05—(//Lambda-2 activates his smoke blower as Lambda-4 releases a smoke grenade through the bathroom door, he then promptly slams it shut. Smoke is seen pouring out beneath the doorframe.//)

**Lambda-4**: You&#39;re welcome.

**Lambda-2**: Fuck off. Have you found POI-1?

1:25—(//Lambda-4 nods and gestures towards the far eastern wall, where a large stereo has been overturned. Large amounts of alcohol are seen having been placed or knocked over around the system.//)

**Lambda-1**: Anyone got eyes on the final POI?

**Lambda-4**: Yes sir, eastern wall.

**Lambda-2**: I don&#39;t see him.

**Lambda-4**: Look closer.

1:40—(//Upon closer inspection POI-4276-1 is located, having been wedged between the wall and a loudspeaker, causing it to fall forward and become inoperable. POI-4276-1&#39;s head has been split open, and a single adult instance of SCP-4276 is acknowledged burrowing into his brain.//)

**Lambda-2**: Bag up the bodies and let&#39;s get the hell out of here. Jameson, help me deal with the bathroom.

**Lambda-3**: Roger that.

**Addendum**: Following a successful operation, MTF Lambda-12 was able to contain a number of living specimens of SCP-4276. 127 active instances have been contained.

SCP-4276 does not hatch easily in conventional conditions, as controlled trials using rats revealed only a ~20% [[footnote]] Subjects were placed into a glass container along with a single instance of SCP-4276, then left within the chamber for 5 days. [[/footnote]] successful birthing rate. Use of carcasses during trials reduced this number to ~16%. --It is currently unknown how to keep the size of SCP-4276 in containment at a stable number, as breeding seems unreliable at best.--

Following recent discoveries, it has been noted that auditory stimuli meeting certain qualifications (such as bass distortion and a 90db minimal requirement) appears to cause accelerated hatching [[footnote]] Henceforth titled a &#39;Genesis Event&#39;. [[/footnote]] within subjects. Test trials commenced afterward included the presence of a speaker blaring audio. Birthing rates increased throughout said tests to ~92%. SCP-4276 can now reliably be replenished for testing. 


[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Open Testing Log-4276&#34; hide=&#34;- Close Testing Log-4276&#34;]]
&gt; **Preword**: All subjects are to be placed into a glass containment chamber 1m by 1m, along with select instances of SCP-4276. These tests are to determine how exactly SCP-4276 is able to accelerate its incubation process.
&gt; -----
&gt; **Subject**: (3) White rats. (1) SCP-4276 Instance.
&gt; **Materials**: N.A.
&gt; **Results**: Subjects are released into containment chamber and are immediately attacked by SCP-4276. SCP-4276 is successful in injecting one subject before being ripped in half by the pack. The injected subject was immediately removed from containment and a foreign body surgery was performed, which resulted in several surviving larvae being removed. Autopsy reveals the presence of numerous deceased larvae. No further damage is reported.
&gt; -----
&gt; **Subject**: (1) White rat. (2) SCP-4276 Instances.
&gt; **Materials**: N.A.
&gt; **Results**: Subject is released into containment chamber and immediately attacked by SCP-4276. Both instances are successful in injecting the subject, but instead of fleeing begin to grip to its backside. Eventually, one instance is successful in piercing the subject&#39;s skin and burrows itself within the subject&#39;s lower back. Subject collapses and Genesis Event results in (5) instances of SCP-4276. Autopsy reveals the presence of fewer larvae than previous tests, but not significantly.
&gt; -----
&gt; **Subject**: (1) Black-footed ferret. (4) SCP-4276 Instances.
&gt; **Materials**: (1) Portable Bluetooth speaker.
&gt; **Results**: Bluetooth speaker is amplified upwards to 95db and placed inside the chamber, and the subject is released into containment. Two wasps are successfully able to inject the subject before it completely enters the chamber. (1) wasp, the only male of the group, is unable to inject or bite the ferret, instead deciding to enter the ferret&#39;s mouth. The male instance is successful and exits seconds later through the subject&#39;s skull. 30 minutes after initial contact Genesis Event begins and (25) instances of SCP-4276 emerge. Autopsy reveals significantly less deceased larvae than previous tests.
&gt; -----
&gt; **Subject**: (1) Desert cottontail. (2) SCP-4276 Instances.
&gt; **Materials**: (1) Portable Bluetooth speaker. See Results Log.
&gt; **Results**: Bluetooth speaker is amplified upwards to 100db and placed directly inside the chamber, the subject is released shortly afterward. Both instances of SCP-4276 are successful in injecting the subject just as it bashes the speaker, rendering it inoperable. The subject was later successful in terminating both occurrences of SCP-4276. Due to recent complications regarding facility power, Site-██ suffered a non-uniform breaker trip. During this time, a fluorescent light illuminating the test chamber began flickering violently, and the subject became erratic. After 10 minutes of violent thrashing, subject&#39;s upper back split open and (42) instances of SCP-4276 emerged.
&gt; -----
&gt; **Subject**: (1) Human male: D-9974. (6) SCP-4276 Instances.
&gt; **Materials**: (1) Portable Bluetooth speaker. (1) LED strobe light.
&gt; **Results**: [DATA EXPUNGED BY ORDER OF ETHICS COMMITTEE]
[[/collapsible]]

Visual stimuli also appear to have an effect on SCP-4276 events, as irregular or extreme illumination shows to accelerate gestation within host subjects. The exact reasoning behind these reactions is unknown, but it should be noted the incredible increase in growth that colonies experience upon encountering these circumstances. It should also be noted that containment procedures have been altered slightly in regards to the aforementioned information: //All shrubland within 8km of Discovery Site-4276 is to be tested for signs of SCP-4276 and cleansed of insect life.//

&gt; **Incident Log-4276-1**:
&gt; 
&gt; On the date of 1999/06/22 Foundation observationalists overlooking the town of Oak Creek in Routt County, Colorado noted the presence of numerous correlated police reports. Several such reports remarked on complaints of a &#34;loud buzzing noise&#34; resonating from the local area. Local police were delayed by agents while surveyors attempted to triangulate the location in question. GPS tracking eventually led Foundation agents to Soroco High School, where the yearly prom night was being held. MTF Lambda-12 was dispatched.

&gt; 
&gt; **Lambda-1**: Lobby clear, taking point.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lambda-3**: Can anyone else hear that buzzing?
&gt; 
&gt; **Lambda-2**: Picking it up too, could have sworn I heard mu—
&gt; 
&gt; 01:00:—//(Buzzing within the school appears to increase in intensity, nearly drowning out the loud thudding resonating from the east of Lambda-1.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Lambda-1**: Standby. //(Lambda-1 raises her hand to her radio.)// Doctor Calloway, this looks like the gymnasium.
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Calloway**: Copy, proceed as instructed.

&gt; 
&gt; **Lambda-1**: Prepare for breach.
&gt; 
&gt; 01:30—//(Lambda-4 tosses two more smoke grenades before agents approach the room. access reveals several corpses scattered across the floor of the gymnasium. Foundation transmitters become deafening loud as the team moves towards the center of the room. swarms of SCP-4276 are seen fluttering across the room in large gatherings. The body of a young girl, swollen and covered in red marks, lays near the entrance.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Lambda-1**: Keep your masks on and assess the damage. We&#39;ll torch this place after we identify where the hive is.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lambda-4**: Colin, make sure that door&#39;s shut and help me count the bodies.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lambda-2**: Sure thing, but what if there are survivors?
&gt; 
&gt; **Lambda-1**: Unlikely. Prep for extermination.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lambda-2**: ... and the kids?
&gt; 
&gt; **Lambda-3**: You mean the ones on the dance floor?
&gt; 
&gt; **Lambda-4**: What about it? hey, Colin!.
&gt; 
&gt; 02:00—//(Lambda-2 approaches the body of a young boy whose body had become heavily bloated, laying skywards beneath the disco ball. A multitude of limbs are seen crumpled into a near singular mass, and  SCP-4276 individuals are seen crawling between several orifices. Suddenly, the abdomen of the young boy bursts and a cloud of instances of SCP-4276 emerge.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Lambda-1**: Jesus fuck! Open fire!
&gt; 
&gt; 02:05—//(Lambda-12 agents activate their flamethrowers and begin neutralizing targets throughout the gym, as large quantities of SCP-4276 are seen fluttering towards the team. Nearly all traces of music is drowned out by buzzing before the feed cuts.)//

&gt; 
&gt; **POI-4276-5**: Holy shit, aren&#39;t we lucky to see some police? Finally. Listen, we need your help man, you gotta get us outta here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lambda-2**: I need to know what happened here first, the whole building is on lockdown.
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-4276-5**: lockdown? I don&#39;t know! The graduation ceremony is next week so we scheduled the prom for tonight, just like every other year. Prom started at 10:00 pm, music started at 11:00 pm, everything else went just as it was supposed to. It wasn&#39;t supposed to end like this! I had gone to get a coffee before the slow dance and...
&gt; 
&gt; //(The man groans loudly before continuing.)//
&gt; 
&gt; When I came back I opened the door… and then I saw Daniel. He had gone out to get some fresh air, but when he came back he kept scratching his arm really bad, thought it was just an allergic reaction. He was the valedictorian, y&#39; know, I expected the best from that kid. But, I see him on the dance floor and he just sorta doubles over and pukes all over his date&#39;s shoes! I go to get a mop and when I get back...There were these bees. No, wasps. Oh, I don&#39;t fucking know! but they were there! I watched them just, crawl all out of his mouth, and they were so bright, I don&#39;t know where they went. Nobody but his date noticed, and she was trying so hard to scream over the music, but before you knew it they just scattered. I tried my best to stop the music but in no time they had gotten all over the place, and everyone just fucking danced! Then the actual screaming started.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lambda-3**: What about the kid in the corner? Is she alright?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-4276-5**: She got attacked by one of those damn things. They started biting everyone, and I watched one crawl right in her mouth. Then she just started seizing. I think one of them got me too, i&#39;m itching all over the place. She&#39;s gonna be alright, right?
&gt; 
&gt; **Lambda-3**: Orders are orders, I&#39;m sorry.

&gt; **Addendum**: MTF Lambda-12 was deemed successful in their mission of eradicating the site of all traces of SCP-4276 whilst minimizing loss of innocent life. Despite best attempts, however, a local investigation revealed the presence of SCP-4276 in nearby homes. Following approval from the Ethics Committee, Class-C amnestics were administered to surviving inhabitants of Oak Creek and cover story 29 &#39;Localized Blaze&#39; was put into effect. The population of Oak Creek, Colorado prior to Incident-4276-1 was estimated to be about [[[*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Creek,_Colorado | 1,020.]]]
