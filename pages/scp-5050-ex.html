**SCP-5050-EX:** Presto!

**Item #:** SCP-5050-EX

**Object Class:** Explained

**Special Containment Procedures:** Under absolutely no circumstances is this object to be designated anything other than Explained. Any effects which might appear to be caused by SCP-5050-EX must be investigated fully to determine their true cause. Attempts to prematurely attribute anomalous effects to SCP-5050-EX will be met with discipline up to and including termination of employment.

**Description:** SCP-5050-EX is a 43 year old Hispanic male individual named James Garcia. SCP-5050-EX&#39;s primary occupation is as a stage magician/entertainer, and originally possessed no inherent anomalous qualities. However, due to the presence of SCP-5050-EX-1, SCP-5050-EX&#39;s typical stage routines have the byproduct of becoming anomalous //ex post facto.//

SCP-5050-EX-1 is a humanoid entity with an unknown capacity for reality bending and spontaneous anomaly generation. SCP-5050-EX-1 is not currently under Foundation containment, and has only been directly communicated with on one occasion. SCP-5050-EX-1 is believed to be the origin of SCP-5050’s anomalous interactions.

SCP-5050-EX&#39;s anomalous byproducts occur upon the conclusion of one of its stage magic routines. Initially, all routines and effects created by SCP-5050-EX are entirely non-anomalous, and can be replicated using mundane equipment or techniques. However, should any viewer of SCP-5050-EX&#39;s performance go 24 hours after the performance without learning how the effect was performed, SCP-5050-EX-1&#39;s influence causes all subsequent performances of the trick to become anomalous.

SCP-5050-EX has generally seemed unaware of SCP-5050-EX-1&#39;s presence, as well as the newly anomalous nature of its tricks following performance. It is not currently believed that SCP-5050-EX is acting in concert with SCP-5050-EX-1, and general research has focused on removing SCP-5050-EX-1&#39;s influence over SCP-5050-EX.

**SCP-5050-EX Performance Log:** The following is an abridged list of SCP-5050-EX performances, as well as explanations for how each trick was performed.

&gt; **Name:** //The Amazing Rabbit out of a Hat!//
&gt; 
&gt; **Original Routine:** SCP-5050-EX procures a rabbit (//Oryctolagus cuniculus//) from a top hat.
&gt; 
&gt; **Solution:** None found. Routine was performed prior to Foundation intervention.
&gt; 
&gt; **Outcome:** The hat used in the routine possesses an anomalous portal to an unspecified dimension that is entirely populated by non-anomalous members of the //Leporidae// family. SCP-5050-EX can withdraw an unknown number of these creatures from the hat; the tested limit reached 129 specimens before testing was terminated due to safety concerns. All other users are unable to access this dimension.

&gt; **Name:** //The Escaping Man!//
&gt; 
&gt; **Original Routine:** SCP-5050-EX appears to be bound with a series of manacles, chains, and other restrictive equipment, before escaping from them within ten minutes after being bound.
&gt; 
&gt; **Solution:** None found. Routine was performed prior to Foundation intervention.
&gt; 
&gt; **Outcome:** SCP-5050-EX can no longer be restrained by any mundane restrictive tools such as handcuffs, manacles, or rope. Shortly after being bound with such equipment, SCP-5050-EX will appear to have removed them without the notice of any observers, even while under direct surveillance. Containment for SCP-5050-EX was upgraded to include non-physical constraints.

&gt; **Name:** //The Magical Saw Trick!//
&gt; 
&gt; **Original Routine:** A participant enters into a wooden box, and lays down with their head and feet visible to the audience. SCP-5050-EX proceeds to saw through the midsection of the box and create the illusion that the participant has been bisected, before &#34;reattaching&#34; the two halves.
&gt; 
&gt; **Solution:** Upon examination by Foundation staff, the box has a series of mirrors and removable sections that create the illusion of bisection. No anomalous effects were observed.

&gt; **Name:** //The Bullet Catch!//
&gt; 
&gt; **Original Routine:** An assistant loads a gun with a bullet in front of the audience. SCP-5050-EX stands behind a pane of glass, while blindfolded. The assistant then aims at SCP-5050-EX, and is seen to fire the gun, which results in a broken pane of glass. SCP-5050-EX then produces the &#34;caught&#34; bullet from its mouth, suggesting that SCP-5050-EX has caught the bullet.
&gt; 
&gt; **Solution:** Originally believed to have been conducted with a fake bullet and blank rounds, a late email from Assistant Researcher █████ ██████████ raised the possibility that the trick was in fact performed with a real bullet that was simply aimed away from SCP-5050-EX. This had the effect of introducing doubt to the explanation of SCP-5050-EX&#39;s routine, allowing for SCP-5050-EX-1&#39;s anomalous effect to activate.
&gt; 
&gt; **Outcome:** SCP-5050-EX is now impervious to small arms fire. Assistant Researcher █████ ██████████ was given an official reprimand and placed on two weeks of unpaid leave.


**SCP-5050-EX-1 Interview Log:** Researchers studying similar situations (notably, SCP-████, SCP-████, and multiple historical accounts) were able to raise the possibility of the existence of SCP-5050-EX-1 as the source of SCP-5050-EX&#39;s anomalous byproducts. Utilizing a Class A Esoteric Capture Chamber, researchers were able to isolate SCP-5050-EX-1 shortly after one of SCP-5050-EX&#39;s performances. Lead researcher Dr. Julio Marquez conducted an interview with the entity.

&gt; //Begin video transcript. SCP-5050-EX-1 appears in the form of a male human, indeterminate racial origin, and between the ages of 20-30. SCP-5050-EX-1 is seen to visibly struggle against the confines of the Esoteric Capture Chamber.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marquez:** Good evening. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5050-EX-1:** Oh, it&#39;s one of you. I wondered when you&#39;d finally notice me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marquez:** Indeed. One of the Moũsai, I presume.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5050-EX-1:** Ahhh, a student of history! Charmed to meet you. Didn&#39;t know that any humans still knew of us.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marquez:** Some of us are lucky enough to have a job where it&#39;s our responsibility to know you. Let&#39;s cut to the chase-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5050-EX-1:** Certainly. I&#39;m busy too, you know.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marquez:** Why are you doing this? Why are you changing his performances? Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s a bit irresponsible?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5050-EX-1:** Irresponsible? You wound me, sir. This is just an artist at work.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marquez:** You don&#39;t think his tricks are getting the wrong kind of attention?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5050-EX-1:** A trick is something a whore does for money, doctor. This is art. And as your kind is fond of saying, all publicity is good publicity.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marquez:** Even if it harms people? You don&#39;t see how that saw trick could have gone wrong?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5050-EX-1:** Ahhh, but art is meant to be dangerous, provocative, a bit exciting, you know? Where&#39;s the excitement without a little danger after all? The best art gets people&#39;s attention, and that is exactly what sweet James asked for.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marquez:** What do you mean?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5050-EX-1:** You know, he prayed for help. He wanted to be a better magician; the kind who would make tricks that no one else could replicate. He didn&#39;t know who was out there listening, of course, but he got it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marquez:** And so you gave him a hand.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5050-EX-1:** How could I not? He was desperate, and so I did it at first for fun; why not see a mortal do something crazy? But somewhere along the line...it changed.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marquez:** Explain.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5050-EX-1:** James is a true artist. He really dedicates himself to his craft. Is it his fault he was born mortal and mundane? I came to admire his work, his ethic, and his ingenuity. And then I started admiring...other things.
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-5050-EX-1 looks in the direction of SCP-5050-EX&#39;s containment chamber and sighs.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marquez:** Oh boy.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5050-EX-1:** He wanted the attention and for people to notice him. Well they did. Maybe one day....he&#39;ll notice me back.

Following this, a structural failure occurred in the Esoteric Containment Chamber, at which point SCP-5050-EX-1 disappeared from sight. No further attempts to capture SCP-5050-EX-1 have succeeded.
