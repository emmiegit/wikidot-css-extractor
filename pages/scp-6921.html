**Item #:** SCP-6921

**Object Class:** --Keter-- Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures (15/06/2012):** Hold in standard humanoid containment chamber. Subject should be kept hogtied on the floor to avoid the risk of it harming itself. Gags can be effective, but subject has a tendency of swallowing them -- standard sound-proofing is preferred.

Subject has been deemed ineligible for any kind of release program due to questions of morality raised by Regional Containment Director ███ █████████. However, a proposal to let it visit the padded solarium is currently being considered. If the subject were to breach containment and retrieval is deemed too costly, a two-man team is to neutralize it to avoid it coming into the possession of a combatant group.

**Description:** SCP-6921 is an immortal man named ███████ █████.

Little is known about its past relationships or personality as it was discovered at the end of an apparent mental breakdown. First responders upon initial discovery described it as a &#34;lonely, doomed drug addict living underneath a bridge next to a small protest camp … hiding inside of the abandoned tents while the riots were happening.&#34; Members of the local homeless population stated that SCP-6921 had moved there recently and had a reputation for having violent outbursts and stealing from the other inhabitants. It soon began claiming that it was immortal, which eventually led to the involvement of the SCP Foundation.

The exact mechanism behind SCP-6921’s immortality or the method it used to attain it are unknown, although it likely did not have this ability from birth. Some have suggested that it gained its abilities through a communion with a minor demonic entity. Others believe that, rather than actually having immortality, SCP-6921 simply has the ability to subconsciously warp reality in such a way that both it and those around it believe that it has immortality. SCP-6921 itself has on occasion made statements alluding to the former:

&gt; &#34;They can’t stop me. I got… heheh, I&#39;m the fuckin&#39; Devil. He don&#39;t care about any of y&#39;all, he cares about me. He //loves// me. He&#39;s my fuckin&#39; bitch cause I&#39;m a crazy ass motherfucker. I-I&#39;m a fuckin&#39; crackhead but I&#39;m a crazy ass motherfucker. I could k... I could fuckin&#39; kill all of you. I swear it, I swear to fuckin&#39; god I could. You&#39;re all fuckin&#39; dead on your feet.&#34;

SCP-6921 possesses scarring on ~30% of its body, including lines along the length of its wrists, circular burns on its shoulders and thighs, and a long crescent-shaped indentation on the side of its head. Medical analysis has shown that the lines on its wrists were the oldest of the scars, and that most were self-inflicted, likely due to self-harm or pleasure related activities. However, others such as the indentations on the head are more difficult to explain.

SCP-6921 has stated that it obtained that scar after it tried to “kill this fuckin’ faggot junkie Lou.” Researchers obtained police reports from around the area and found mentions of a homeless man named █████ ████████ who had reportedly gone by the nickname ‘Lou’. However, this individual had been dead for thirty years, and SCP-6921’s scar appears to be more recent. Ritualization was suggested, but deemed unlikely as SCP-6921 did not and likely still does not have the experience to carry out a ritual.

**Addendum 1: Update 16/06/2012**

Six months after its capture, SCP-6921&#39;s vocabulary began to deteriorate. This confused researchers as it was enrolled in Site-51’s therapy program at the time and thus its mental faculties should have been improving. Site Director █████████ tried to move SCP-6921 to a new cell with exterior windows, but was denied due to the region&#39;s transportation policies regarding Keter-class anomalies.

Site Director █████████ tried to change SCP-6921&#39;s object class to Euclid over the next three weeks. In their email to Regional Containment Director █████████, they wrote, &#34;SCP-6921 does not have the intellect nor the strength to cause any kind of breach. The man couldn&#39;t overpower a drug addict in his prime, so I don&#39;t see how he could possibly do anything to one of our guards.&#34; The Regional Containment Director █████████ eventually agreed to lower SCP-6921’s object class – but at the point of redesignation, its speech had deteriorated to the point where it was largely non-verbal. It became combative with personnel and was soon unenrolled from the Site-51 therapy program. 

Personnel guarding its chamber report that it &#34;only squeals like a pig&#34; now.

Below are transcripts of some of SCP-6921&#39;s ramblings recorded before the events of **Addendum 1**.

&gt; “I … I don’t give a shit. You hear me? You fuckin&#39; Nazi bitch, you hear me!? I don’t give a fuck about whatever y’all are doin’! Don’t worry about me. I’m gonna be fine. I’m gonna be //just// fuckin’ fine.”

&gt; “It’s pointless. It’s pointless, it’s fuckin’ useless… Shut your fuckin’ shit up! Stupid bitch… The memory is the fuckin&#39; point. Don&#39;t give a shit if I were alive or if I was dead. You only care when I make your lawn smell like fuckin&#39; shit.&#34;

&gt; “Fuck you! Your ass is fuckin’ dead! I’m gonna get outta here and I’m gonna kill your whole fuckin’ family. Nobody is gonna remember who the fuck you are. They’re gonna remember me, bitch! Weak ass motherfuckers... None of y’all are fuckin’ men, none of y’all wanna fuckin’ talk to me. Come in here! Come in here!”

&gt; “Y’know, this shit is gonna fall. These walls are gonna fall and when that happens, you know where the fuck I&#39;ll be? I’ll be fuckin’ out and you’ll all be fuckin’ dead! You’re //dead//! Y’all can’t do shit to me! I’m gonna outlast every fuckin&#39; box you Nazi bitches got. And when that shit falls, //I’m// gon’ be what’s left. They’ll come here to look at //me// and all the shit //I// did and all the motherfuckers //I// killed. When you die, you fuckin’ bitches are gonna be forgotten! And I know from the face of fuckin&#39; //god// that that day is comin&#39; real fuckin&#39; soon. He told me himself. Real fuckin&#39; soon, I swear to god -- I swear to god. It&#39;s comin&#39; real soon.&#34;
