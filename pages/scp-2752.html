**Item #:** SCP-2752

**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** [[[task-forces#alpha-4|Mobile Task Force Alpha-4 (&#34;Pony Express&#34;)]]] is tasked with the identification and interception of SCP-2752 instances before they are sent to the addresses of their respective recipients. A scanned copy of each recovered SCP-2752 instance is to be produced, and stored in Archival Sector 7 at Site-64. After scanning, original copies may be incinerated. 

Persons affected by SCP-2752 are to be held at E-class holding cells at Site-64, and undergo weekly medical checkups. At the discretion of the attending Medical Officer, invasive surgical procedures may be enacted on such persons to prevent health complications attributed to SCP-2752. 

**Description:** SCP-2752 refers to a series of letters mailed to New Zealand addresses, offering advertising mail opt-out services to recipients. The sender is attributed to an organisation named &#39;Robinson Toʊ Liz&#39;, which is not listed as a registered company in New Zealand or any polity known to the Foundation. No return address is found in confiscated SCP-2752 instances. To date, all known instances of SCP-2752 are sent solely to male individuals aged between 20 to 60 and with legal addresses in New Zealand cities. 

When SCP-2752 is read by its intended recipient (hereon referred to as &#39;subject&#39;), the following anomalous occurrences will manifest: 
* Cessation of mail letters (advertising mail or otherwise) sent to the address of the subjects instances. Through the use of letters equipped with a GPS tracker, letters are shown to have vanished when placed inside a mailbox. Hand-delivered mail letters are exempted from this effect. 
* Claircognizance regarding the contents of mail letters that would be sent to the subjects. This occurs after said letters are placed in a mailbox. 
* Traces of black dye manifested in subject&#39;s urinary system, particularly the kidney, bladder and urethra. 
* Manifestation of paper pieces inside subject&#39;s internal organs, including stomach, large intestines, lungs, kidney etc. 

Scanned and handwritten copies of SCP-2752 do not possess this effect on their intended recipient. 

SCP-2752 was identified on ██/██/1974 in Auckland, New Zealand when multiple paper strips were found in the lungs of PoI-2752-01 (Mr. █████ ████) after a surgery. While initially believed to be an isolated incident, similar cases were identified in other New Zealand cities and SCP-2752 was officially classified. 

**Addendum 2752-1:** Interview Log PoI-2752-04-13 [Date: ██/██/1975]

&gt; **Interviewee:** PoI-2752-04 (Mr. ████ ███████)
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Aster Black 
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** The following interview is conducted at PoI-2752-04&#39;s request.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Black:** ███████, I heard you have requested for me. So what&#39;s wrong? 
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-2752-04:** Doctor, &#39;wrong&#39; is an understatement. I&#39;ve received another letter... uh, up here. 
&gt; 
&gt; [PoI-2752-A04 points to its forehead.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Black:** ███████, we&#39;ve debriefed on this already. This is a difficult time, but-
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-2752-04:** It was from Robinson Toʊ Liz. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Black:** Okay, I&#39;m listening. What did they say? 
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-2752-04:** The usual &#39;thank you for using us&#39; crap. But they sure have a weird way of expressing they have fucked up. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Black:** Please give me some examples of these expressions. 
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-2752-04:** That they didn&#39;t know that cellulose is indigestible, or that ink poisoning is a thing. And the biological peculiarities of the so-called humans of this plane, that was underlined and a direct quote. They also gave us compensation, a cheque with a very large sum of money in yen. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Black:** Do you recall the value?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-2752-04:** 960,000,000,000 yen, precisely that amount. But doctor... if this is anything like the rest of their so-called service, I&#39;m not getting any real money, am I? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Black:** We will have to wait and see first. 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Interviews with other subjects indicate that they have received similar letters from &#39;Robinson Toʊ Liz&#39;. The value offered by &#39;Robinson Toʊ Liz&#39; is consistent among all subjects, at a value of ¥960,000,000,000.

**Addendum 2752-2:** On ██/██/1975, postage stamps are found manifested underneath the tongues of all known subjects. [[footnote]] This includes the corpses of currently deceased subjects, with said stamps manifested from within the ashes of said instances. [[/footnote]] Denomination is stated as ¥960,000,000,000. Said stamps have a banana tree motif, and are labelled &#34;[[[Dai-tō-a]]] – Malai Baru&#34;. 

No anomalous quality has been identified among recovered stamps. All instances of said postage stamps are provisionally kept in Storage Sector 2 at Site-64, and slated for incineration.
