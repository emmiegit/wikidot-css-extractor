[[tab Greetings and Notice]]

Good day! [[*user tingfeng1999]] here. Thanks for paying a visit to my crazy little hub[[footnote]] Yes! Finally posted a third article! [[/footnote]] of works related to the SCP Foundation. Looking forward to contribute[[footnote]] Probably write more wild, random and emotional stuff. [[/footnote]] more to the community. You can reach out to me via Wikidot PM or SCP official Discord.

May your brilliant minds and powerful words stay unscathed against the winds of impermanence.

Enjoy the content and enjoy making your own!

**Notice:**

Due to various reasons, I will no longer be an active member of the SCP writing community. Thank you for the support and tolerance, but no banquet in this world can last forever. To whoever reading this, I hope you continue to find joy in your life[[footnote]]Without building it on top of others&#39; suffering.[[/footnote]].

Still, if you have any proposals and other issues that you believe should require my uttermost concern, especially if it involves my past works, feel free to poke me via the previously mentioned methods. I will try my best to respond accordingly, but if I failed to do so, please refer to the &#34;Rights and Permissions and Last Will&#34; tab.

**Update:**

If you see me post something out of the blue, it is me paying back some old favours.

[[tab Rights and Permissions and Last Will]]

Like most other SCP related works, all my works go under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license. This includes the articles, artworks, and photographs, but please take note that some of the images are derivative work. You may use them anyway you like as long as you credit me appropriately[[footnote]]Please include the title/filename of content you used and my Wikidot username somewhere obvious at some point in your derivative work - which does not require a lot of zoom in to read clearly.[[/footnote]]. If the content gets //naturally// deleted, it should be allowed so. If any kind soul decides to archive them, I appreciate that, but it is fine if that does not happen.

If I am totally inactive on the SCP wiki site (including as a reader) for over 12 months, I am either: totally detached from the SCP community, stuck somewhere with no internet, too sick to move, or dead. If that happens, all the rights of the collaborative works I participated in goes to the other author(s). For articles involving the Ninth World and the Valravn Corporation, their rights go to [[*user SYTYCFanon]] and [[*user Kilerpoyo]] respectively. Both if they overlap.

And please, do not rewrite my works without my permission[[footnote]]If you can no longer obtain a reply from me, it&#39;s a no, unless it falls into the right transfer categories. Please ask the new right owners if that&#39;s the case.[[/footnote]]. If you plan to use them commercially, I will appreciate that you inform me beforehand (although I cannot stop you from doing that because of the license).

[[tab Free Ideas for Pickup]]

This is the home of some unwritten SCP-related ideas originated from me[[footnote]]Ignore if someone else already did them before, especially in really similar ways.[[/footnote]]. Feel free to use them and write any article/tale/GoI format or produce art based on these ideas, as long as you credit me appropriately[[footnote]]Refer to tab &#34;Rights and Permissions and Last Will&#34;.[[/footnote]]. You will still possess the full rights to the stuff you write based on these ideas, all I want is an honourable mention. Please feel free to modify the ideas below, as long as it does not stray far away from the core.

Also, please let me know on Discord or Wikidot PM if you plan to use any of these ideas, but my reply is not mandatory for you to proceed. It&#39;s more like a kind poke instead of anything else. Please also leave a comment under this page to let others know if an idea here is taken, just in case.

**Title:** The Superior Distant Cousin of Diamonds
**Type:** SCP article, possibly -J
**Tone:** Joke

**Summary:**
A huge chunk of charcoal which memetically forces anyone who is aware of existence to describe it with florid and positive language, which often involves exaggerated praising of the charcoal and degenerative language on anything else mentioned alongside it - especially things that it is compared to. The charcoal was originally bought by a group of students in Malaysia (coal is not common here, so charcoal is used to achieve the effect) to prank/bully their classmate during the class&#39; Christmas gift event. When the victim opened the gift box, they fell under the charcoal&#39;s effect and started praising it despite knowing it&#39;s a prank, looking confused afterwards. The culprits were equally confused, but also fell under the charcoal&#39;s effect when they tried to mock and question the victim about their behaviour.

**It Feels Like:** Being written by someone affected by the charcoal, except the computer generated memetic hazard warning at the start of the article.

//P.S.: Please do contact me if you want to write this so that I can send you the picture of a gigantic chunk of charcoal in my house as the SCP photo. Trust me, you will not be disappointed.//

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Title:** Lucid Dreams
**Type:** SCP article, K-con? 001? Normal article will do actually
**Tone:** Thriller, Horror

**Summary:**

Dreams have always been part of human life and culture. Sometimes they reflect our mind and memories, sometimes they are whispers from higher beings, and other times they are totally wild. 

Since dreams happen when we are unconscious, normal people have little to no control over their dreams, but &#34;lucid dreams&#34; have always been a method practiced by spiritualists, oracles, and thaumaturgy users to connect with their subconsciousness, higher beings, or entities that reside within the dreamscape - like the Oneroi Collective. But hey, since their home is formed by our dreams, what happens when some of them are not happy with the world we&#39;ve made for them?

Every coin has two sides, all forces have an opposing one, and thus a stable reality is formed. When there are times that humans are conscious, there should be a time where we are unconscious as well.  If daydreaming makes us lose grip on reality even when awake, does being awake in dreams do the same? What if we are forced to dream in our sleep, and also forced to be awake in our dreams?

**It Feels Like:** Basically exploring the concept that if we are lucid in our dreams, the beings of dreams might get to control us - and our reality - instead. Humans are forced into lucid dreams en masse.

**Title:** The Zhizha Artist
**Format:** SCP article
**Tone:** Tragedy
**Object Class:** Thaumiel?

[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#omega-0 If you can read this, you are dead.]

Members of MTF Omega-0 (&#34;Ará Orún&#34;) came across ans old woman who was among the few survivors of a spectral entity outbreak at a shop district in Malaysia. Turns out she is a Taoist paper artist who has the ability to see spectral entities, as well as sense the thoughts and presence of informational construct entities - as long as they are //dead//. She is able to sense Omega-0&#39;s presence and deliver them a message via her mind, prompting for Omega-0 to contact her after she was amnesticized and released back to civilian life, as the Foundation failed to understand her peculiarities.

In further interactions, the old lady explained that she has the Yin-Yang eye - a Taoism term for the eyes of people who can see the dead&#39;s spirits - since she was born. After an accidental discovery, she and Omega-0 discovered that her paper art products can turn into functional informational constructs of existing items after being incinerated, as long as the paper art bears enough resemblance to connect its viewer directly to the original item. Trial and error also proves that by assigning ownership to these informational constructs via the lady&#39;s prayers or by writing the recipient&#39;s name on the paper art piece stabilizes it, but of course, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3664 shit happens before they realized that.] The lady agreed to assist Omega-0, as long as they help monitor the Foundation&#39;s database for clues about her lost son, who was assumed dead during an atypical Taoist cult ritual.

**It Feels Like:** The interaction between a sorrowful and tired old woman and an equally sorrowful and tired Omega-0.

//P.S.: Please also try to ask the creator of Omega-0 and SCP-3664&#39;s author before you decide to start on this, and ask other writers with more experience on Omega-0, just in case.//
