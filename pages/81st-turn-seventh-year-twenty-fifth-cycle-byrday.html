+++ From the Journal of Aframos Longjourney, Pilgrim
+++ With notes by Avos Torr, Scholar of Rheve Library
+++ Byrday, Twenty-fifth Cycle, Seventh Year, 81st Turn
++++ Ninety-fourth Day in the Trees

The floor above us has several beds. They are too small for me, but Torne used one last night. There are also racks for weapons and armor, though they are all bare[[footnote]] During their height, the Theskian towers were fully supplied to allow a small team to last six months between supplies. However, when the Eternal Empire fell, the towers were mostly looted (often by the soldiers, now unpaid, who had been stationed there). [[/footnote]].

The highest floor has a central room filled with empty, broken crates, and smaller rooms with large, glassless windows looking out around the tower. There are iron poles Torne tells me were once the mounts for weapons.

The creatures keep testing the tower, trying to climb up. So far, they have been unsuccessful. They have hands of some sort, but they don&#39;t seem to have the strength or mobility in their arms to pull their bodies up.

Occasionally, one will run up on the tower, jump, and grab a handhold. They will cling for as long as they can, and then fall with a clatter.

Aside from the sound of bone-on-bone, they&#39;ve been largely silent, at least around the tower. Occasionally, we&#39;ll hear that keening sound from the woods, often followed by the scream of some other creature. But nearer to us, they seem to be keeping their silence.

The river runs swiftly. I believe we can still ford it, but it will take time and preparation. Sadly, I do not think we can convince the creatures to give us that time.

Our best hope is to outwait them. However, we only have a day&#39;s worth of water left.

If they give up soon, we can make our escape across the river. However, if they choose to wait, our only path of escape will be through them. They are not terribly large, being only a little taller than Torne. But something about them chills me. The keening sounds and the screams from the forest weigh on my mind. I do not want any fight, but this one less than most.</textarea></pre>
