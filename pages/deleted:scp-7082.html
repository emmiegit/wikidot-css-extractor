**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7082 is to be held within a standard 18.93 mL paint closed metallic paint bucket. All growths produced by SCP-7082 inside the bucket must be removed and incinerated on a daily basis. All personnel are required to wear SCP-7082 protectant clothing. After a test on SCP-7082 has been preformed, all instances of SCP-7082 that participated in the test are to be incinerated. Testing on SCP-7082 has been temporarily discontinued until further notice

**Description:** SCP-7082 is a green liquid of a unknown origin with of a consistency and behavior similar to that of paint. When SCP-7082 is applied to any solid surface, tropical flora will start to rapidly grow from the liquid, no matter if the surface or the environment is suitable for floral growth. All floral growths originating from SCP-7082 secret the liquid via the floras leaves. The the size and appearance of the growths depends on the size and materials of the surface the liquid is being applied on. Upon further inspection, all growths created by SCP-7082 are made up of the liquid, but in a solid form

**Addendum 7082.1 Test Log:**
||~ Material 7082 was applied to ||~ Results ||
|| Standard Tile Floor || A variety of different flora, there were no out of the ordinary events reported in regard to the size, quality, color, etc. of the flora. ||
|| Standard 3x3 Rubik&#39;s Cube || Several small multicolored palm trees and ferns began to grow from the object, the flora also seemed to have a structured composed of simple geometric shapes.||
|| Concrete Wall of testing area || All floral growths began growing upward towards the ceiling, along with one, unidentified species of flora began to grow which resembled a mixture of concrete, drywall, and other metallic materials ||
|| Computer || SCP-7082 only grew a singular, rapidly growing fern which made its way into the hardware of the computer, and quickly started secreting SCP-7082 into the computer. All UI on the computer reconstructed itself to appear as if floral growths had started forming within the software. Eventually a small tropical tree burst through the screen of the computer.||
|| Fertilized Soil || SCP-7082 grew many different tropical flora at a even more significantly fast rate, filling up the entire testing chamber within 5 minutes and 17 seconds. All instances of SCP-7082 that participated in the were incinerated in order to stop its growth. ||


**Addendum:** 

**SCP-7082-01:** During transportation from one site to another, a accidental spillage caused a mass breach of SCP-7082. Within a hour, SCP-7082 had spread roughly 500 meters in diameter. Cleanup is still ongoing.
