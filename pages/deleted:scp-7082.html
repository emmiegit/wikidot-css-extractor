**Item#:**  SCP-7082

**Clearance Level 1:**  Confidential 

**Object Class:**  Safe 
**Disruption Class:**  1/Dark
**Risk Class:**  1/Notice

**Special Containment Procedures:**Due to its nature, SCP-7082 cannot be moved to a secure location so security measures must be placed on-site. A perimeter fence has been established to keep members of the public away from the area. A cover story has been established that the tower is highly unstable, and is likely to collapse. 

**Description:**SCP-7082 is the designation for a tower located in Rotherham, England. SCP-7082 stands at a height of 35m (115ft). The tower is made from limestone, and it appears to be in a state of disrepair due to age, weather and neglect.

SCP-7082&#39;s anomalous affect only manifests when a person climbs to the top of the tower. Once a person has reached the top of SCP-7082 the landscape will appear to have changed based on the time of day. The landscape will appear to look like different stages of human evolution. At the time, six landscapes lasting for four hours have been identified, and have been documented below.

**Addendum:** 7082-1
The following are the times, and landscapes that have been documented so far.

Period-1 24:00am-04:00am 
The landscape will appear as a wide open plain. Neanderthal tribes have been documented hunting native wildlife, and setting up traps.

Period-2 04:00am-08:00am 
The landscape will become filled with farmlands, and cattle. A large castle has been documented with knights appearing to stand guard. The knights, clothes, and structures all appear to be from the medieval period.

Period-3 08:00am-12:00pm 
The landscape will change to a period from the industrial age. A large factory with smoke rising out of several chimneys have been documented. Sounds of machines, and workers have been heard throughout the four hour period.

Period-4 12:00pm-16:00pm
--The landscape will appear to coincide with the present day.

Period-5 16:00pm-20:00pm 
The landscape will appear futuristic in nature, with new technology that has the ability to bend reality. 

Period 20:00pm-24:00am
The landscape will appear as being an apocalyptic wasteland. All organic life has been wiped out due to a conflict resulting in the end of the native race. High levels of radiation have been documented. 

**Addendum:** 7082-2
At 23:50am, the landscape will enveloped by a thick fog. This fog will disappear at midnight, restarting the cycle, and the process repeating.

**Note:** The natives do not appear to be aware of the tower, nor can any contact be established by SCP personnel.</textarea></pre>
