**Item #:** SCP-7248

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7248 outbreaks are to be reported to onsite IT personnel. The affected computer is to be isolated, retrieved, and disassembled after checking whether its goal was achieved or not.

**Description:** SCP-7248 is a computer virus that manifests at random throughout Foundation systems. The virus is characterized by the sudden appearance of an executable file labeled &#34;arhg.exe&#34;, which immediately runs on the affected system. 

SCP-7248&#39;s effects manifest shortly after the execution of the aforementioned file. Following its execution, the computer becomes locked from user input, with the screen reading:

&gt; Blast yer paystubs, Foundation bastards!

Following a period of 10 minutes, SCP-7248 will uninstall itself and multiply, manifesting at a 5:1 ratio throughout the department it originally appeared in. Following a successful execution of arhg.exe, the system&#39;s primary user will find a charge roughly equivalent to their last monthly paycheck. No destination for these funds has been found.

**Addendum-7248-A:** **Incident Log**
Due to the seemingly in-depth knowledge of Foundation paychecks possessed by SCP-7248, an extensive investigation was launched into the destination and perpetrator of the lost funds. Upon conclusion of said search, it was concluded that SCP-7248 likely originated from another dimension; further research determined the exact multi-dimensional coordinates of SCP-7248&#39;s origination shortly thereafter, and a convoy consisting of MTF Blur-02 &#34;In-and-Out&#34; was sent with the intent to establish diplomatic connections with the group responsible for perpetuating the anomaly.

The outcome, however, was that all seven members of Blur-02 returned stripped bare of all equipment -- including sidearms, recording equipment, body armor, and wallets -- and covered in a variety of cuts and bruises, the former of which they all claimed were the result of &#34;sword fights&#34; the anomalous group forced them into. Blur-02 was, however, provided a note in a bottle before their forced return, the contents of which are recorded below:

[[=]]
&gt; Yer Foundation men do be weak and whiney
&gt; If ye think you can take me gold, you can kiss me hiney!
&gt; If you want peace, then listen a&#39; me
&gt; Keep on sending thee shiny!
[[/=]]

Following the return of Blur-02, containment procedures have been updated: every other month, a shipment containing approximately $15,000 worth of a variety of gold, jewels, polished pearls, limes, and bird seed are to be sent to Dimension-Au79. Since implementation of said procedures, all fraudulent charges perpetuated by SCP-7248 have ceased.
