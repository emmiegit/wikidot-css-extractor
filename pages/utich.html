++ PROFILE

**Name:** Intake Specialist G. Utich

**Clearance Level:** 4 (Tentative)

**Current Assignment:** RAISA Office of Information Intake

**Biography:** Utich was born in ████████, Oregon, USA on ██-██-19██ to a middle-class family. He attended university for 9 years, finishing his academic career with a Doctorate in Speech-Language Pathology from ███████████ University. The Foundation took interest in Utich shortly after he developed an auditory therapy headset during his research at the University of ██████████. This device incidentally doubled as an effective tool for filtering auditory cognitohazards.

After 3 years at the Foundation, Utich was promoted to his current position in the Records and Information Security Administration. He currently specializes in intake and second entry with heavy emphasis on protecting the Database from memetic influences in data and media.

++ POI ADDENDUM NADIR-A

**Discovery:** During a routine sweep of Foundation Database edits for cognitohazards, RAISA found  that G. Utich&#39;s first name does not appear in any forms of media directly connected to SCP Mainlist pages via superficial indexing. This includes any and all digital signatures, employee directories, test logs, and interviews. This effect is not present in Utich&#39;s first initial or surname. Despite multiple attempts to enter his first name -- G. -- into the database, it is always replaced by &#34;G.&#34; either during the editing process or immediately after publishing. This effect has been observed to occur within as little as 0.035 milliseconds after edits.

As a part of Project Nadir&#39;s goal to assess the anomalous properties within the Database, G. Utich&#39;s personnel file has been preserved and pages he has recently made significant edits to have been preserved for further examination. It has been determined that this change is infohazardous -- though the effect&#39;s nature and ramifications are currently unknown. Counter-memetic revisions have been added to Utich&#39;s pages under the guise of simple grammatical or content revisions in an attempt to subvert any influence Utich has on the Database should the error&#39;s cognitohazardous effect activate or become apparently influential.

Utich has been designated POI Nadir-A for the time being.

**Pages of Interest:** Several pages have been assigned to Utich in the past and are currently under review for anomalous influence. Should any page to be found to contain infohazards -- however subtle -- they will be identified as such in the table below.
