**Item #:** SCP-5627

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The 28 known extant colonies of //Myrmica sabuleti// [[footnote]] A red ant species.[[/footnote]] are to be monitored monthly by a Class C Foundation myrmecologist. All efforts must be made to sustain these colonies as viable hosts for //Phengaris arion// [[footnote]] Large Blue Butterfly. [[/footnote]] larvae.  If ant numbers fall below required levels then activities must be triggered to detect, remove and remediate any SCP-5627 anomalous parasitic phenomena.  Access to colony location coordinates requires Level 2 clearance.

Foundation staff involved in managing SCP-5627 should familiarise themselves with the parasitic lifecycle of the //P. a. arion butterfly// [[footnote]] [https://www.nature.com/articles/srep36364 Nature Article: Host-ant specificity of endangered large blue butterflies (Phengaris spp., Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) in Japan].[[/footnote]].


**Description:** SCP-5627 is the collective designation for anomalous parasitic phenomena pertaining to the //P. a. arion// butterfly species. 

SCP-5627-1 are anomalous //P. a. arion// larvae. They manifest when //P. a. arion&#39;s// brood-host colonies of //M. sabuleti// come under extreme survival pressure and are unable to sustain non-anomalous //P. a. arion// larvae. Example causes of colony collapse include over-intensive farming, chemical contamination, noise pollution and flooding. SCP-5627-1 parasitic behaviour, including SCP-5627-2 production, is a survival mechanism of last resort.

SCP-5627-1 have pink bodies with brown heads and fine colourless bristles. Their segmental divisions are deeply incised, with a longitudinal dorsal furrow.  During its 270 day larval period, with sufficient protein intake, an SCP-5627-1 grows from 3.0 mm in length to 50-60 cm with an average final mass of 4.0 kg. It then enters its pupal stage, forming a chrysalis. Thereafter growth ceases. Dissections of pupal SCP-5627-1 invariably find they have exceeded their maximum biologically viable size. No final butterfly forms of SCP-5627-1 have been observed.

Analysis of SCP-5627-2, the milky-white saccharine liquid secreted by SCP-5627-1, has established traces of psychotropic and hallucinogenic compounds. Its mechanism of action merits further study. SCP-5627-2 has been detected in aerosol form up to a 200 m radius of an SCP-5627-1. 

SCP-5627-3 are humans under the influence of SCP-5627-2.  SCP-5627-3s, exposed to SCP-5627-2 in its aerosol form, will perceive an SCP-5627-1 instance to be a person of great importance to them. Operating under this delusion they will introduce the instance into their home, where they will groom and feed it with whatever protein they can obtain over a period of months.

SCP-5627-3 status can be determined from the following behaviours, all of which are consistent with ant-host functions under non-anomalous //P. a. arion// influence:

||~ Aspect||~ SCP-5627-3 Diagnostic Behaviour||
|| Acquisition ||  Conveying an SCP-5627-1 instance to the SCP-5627-3&#39;s residence, storing the individual buccally or sub-lingually for safe transport, size-permitting. ||
|| Hosting || Installing SCP-5627-1 in the SCP-5627-3&#39;s sleeping accommodation. ||
|| Grooming|| Orally and manually cleaning SCP-5627-1&#39;s bristles, segmental grooves and dorsal furrow throughout its larval growth phase. ||
|| SCP-5627-1 Nutrition || Feeding SCP-5627-1 with any procurable protein via mastication and oral-to-oral regurgitation.||
|| SCP-5627-3 Nutrition|| Ingesting SCP-5627-2 daily from SCP-5627-1&#39;s dorsal gland in increasing quantities as the larva grows. ||
|| Hallucinations || Perceiving SCP-5627-1 as the most critically &#34;important&#34; member of their family  ||
|| Protection|| Prone to extreme anxiety and even violence (usually biting) if SCP-5627-1 is removed from the residence or threatened in any way. ||

SCP-5627-3 will neglect all other non-survival-essential activities and relationships. Nutrients gained from ingesting SCP-5627-2 satisfy SCP-5627-3 calorific intake requirements.

With support SCP-5627-3s are able to return to their normal behaviour patterns when the SCP-5627-1 is removed or dies.



**Addendum: SCP-5627-3 Interview Record**

&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-5627-3 [Formerly and afterwards called Mabel Taylor, 45]
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr Stuart L. Goddard [Foundation myrmecologist]
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** This interview took place immediately post-removal of a deceased SCP-5627-1 pupa from the SCP-5627-3&#39;s bedroom, at its residence prior to administration of an amnestic. It was unclear how long the SCP-5627-1 had been dead.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Start Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** I know you&#39;re very distressed right now but it would be very helpful for us to understand what you&#39;ve been going through.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5627-3:** I…I&#39;ve lost her again haven&#39;t I?
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Her?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5627-3:** I can&#39;t believe she&#39;s gone. I would have done anything for her you know. I tried, I really did. But she was so hungry. All the time. I did my best didn&#39;t I? I gave her everything I could.  Kept her nice and clean too.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** I&#39;m sure you did Mabel. Now it would be incredibly useful for us to get an idea of exactly how much food you were giving it. Her.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5627-3:** Well I just fed her whenever she wanted it. Chicken, bacon, mince, you know, meat and all that.  Prawns sometimes and curry as a treat. Boiled eggs were her favourite . . . she loved them. Especially when Mum chewed them up a bit for her. In the end I ran out of money though because I haven&#39;t been working for a while.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Yes, and so what was she eating towards the end? When you couldn&#39;t go to the shops?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5627-3:** Anything I could get hold of really. She was just like my little Sarah. She&#39;d chat to me just like Sarah used to. Sounded just like her. I lost Sarah ten years ago in a car accident, so I know it wasn&#39;t her really.  After the accident I started going for walks up in the hills behind the village to get some headspace - you know up near where they had that heather fire? Only five years old when I lost her.  Sorry, I’m rambling now.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Do you live here alone Mabel? Is there anyone here you can rely on for support when we&#39;ve left? I think you have a dog don&#39;t you? I can see some empty dog food cans over there.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5627-3:** He&#39;s out in the garden isn&#39;t he? I haven&#39;t seen him for a while … [//coughs//] I&#39;ve got a really sore throat, sorry. I get terrible acid reflux these days. Can I have a glass of water please?  I&#39;ve got an awful taste at the back of my mouth.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** This SCP-5627-3&#39;s dog remains unaccounted for. A Class C amnestic was administered and the SCP-5627-3 made a full recovery. The nearby //M. sabuleti// colony was restored and added to the database for monitoring.
