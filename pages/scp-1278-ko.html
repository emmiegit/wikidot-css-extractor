**Item #:** SCP-1278-KO

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1278-KO is bought by the Foundation, and its entrance is sealed shut. No other measures were required.

**Description:** SCP-1278-KO refers to the area on the third floor of an office building in Ansan-si, Gyeonggi-do, which lacks any partition walls. 

The following phenomena happen in SCP-1278-KO from 8:00 AM to 2:30 PM KST, at which the inside of the room resets at 8:00 AM and repeats. Byproducts generated by SCP-1278-KO during the phenomena are non-anomalous.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**{{Occurrence #2, recorded at discovery on 31/10/2022.}}**

----

**1.** At 8:00 AM, the lights inside SCP-1278-KO turn on, and SCP-1278-KO-A(referred to as A), who is in charge of installing decotiles[[footnote]]Flooring made of Polyvinyl Chloride(PVC).[[/footnote]], and his assistant SCP-1278-KO-B(referred to as B), appears from the entrance out of nowhere. A puts his bag full of bags down in the centre of SCP-1278-KO.

**2.** A proceeds to enjoy a cup of instant cafe latte. A then pulls out a broom and scraper and starts cleaning the leftmost corner of the room after drinking the latte.

**3.** B follows A&#39;s orders, heads to the entrance, and disappears, after which he reappears, struggling to push a handcart carrying twelve(12) decotile boxes to the wall near the entrance. B repeats this action until 9:00 AM, when 48 boxes are piled up. A orders B to bring a heavy-duty glue canister and several gunny sacks, to which B complies.

**4.** After cleaning the left corner, A pulls out a glue spatula from the toolbox, opens the glue can with his hand, and pours it on the floor. He then proceeds to coat the floor with the glue evenly.

**5.** Several minutes past 9, B starts sweeping the centre of the room with the broom. As B sweeps slower compared to A&#39;s glue spreading, A continues to blame B while cleaning. From this point on, B appears intimidated. While B is cleaning, A harshly orders B to move ten (10) decotile boxes near the glue-coated floor. A opens the boxes and starts installing the tiles.

**6.** At 10 AM, B still has not finished cleaning. A asks B why he is taking so long. B replies by saying there were bumps on the bottom of the tiles, and when he removed the bumps, there was a lot of cement, which he took a lot of time scraping off with scrapers. A insults B saying that B is a &#34;braindead twat&#34;, and snatches the broom from B&#39;s hand and starts cleaning himself. He blames B again for forgetting to hammer the clearly visible nails on the floor.

**7.** A finishes installing the tiles on the left side and cleaning the centre of the room. At 10:30 AM, he pours glue onto the centre of the room and continues installing the tiles. A blames B for doing a lousy job cleaning the floor and insults him, complaining, &#34;anyone can sweep the floor&#34;. A urges B to move the decotile boxes near the wall onto the left floor, where the tiles are installed. Suffering from the verbal abuse, B starts weeping, to which A scoffs, saying he does not deserve to cry.

**8.** At 11:00 AM, B has completed moving the tile boxes and sits on the floor with a blank expression. A urges B to clean the right side of the room, saying that the faster he cleans the room, the earlier they&#39;ll all go home. B sips some water, picks up the broom and sweeps the right side of the room. At 11:30 AM, A is nearly finished with the centre tiles and drinks water near B.

**9.** After cleaning, B moves the decotile boxes to the centre of the room. A then scolds B to use the handcart if he&#39;s over-encumbered and insults B, saying if he keeps being &#34;braindead&#34;, he&#39;ll &#34;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-63443044 end up like those blokes in Itaewon]&#34;. B fights back, saying, &#34;that is no way to talk about the dead&#34;. A ignores it and keeps insulting B. B weeps.

**10.** At noon, A finishes the installation, and B collects decotile debris and trash into the gunny bags. A lectures B that &#34;earning money is tough, nothing in this world is easy&#34; and blames B&#39;s incompetence for taking longer than external workers. B, pouting, picks up A&#39;s used cigarette carton and throws it into the gunny sack.

**11.** A few minutes before 1:00 PM, A puts all his equipment into the tool bag. He grabs the bag and heads out to the door they entered with B. The lights inside SCP-1278-KO turn off.

**{{Occurence #4. Content that overlaps with the 2nd occurrence was omitted.}}**

* {{**Heading:** SCP-1278-KO was heavily damaged after 2:30 PM, so SCP-1278-KO-A and -B cannot finish their work before 2:30 PM.}}

-----

**1.** B is astonished at SCP-1278-KO&#39;s status. B mentions the work might go on until the next day, to which A responds by saying the real work has just begun. B seems intimidated.

**2.** B is noticeably slower compared to the 2nd occurrence. A&#39;s insults, and scolding becomes more frequent.

**3.** A blames B saying, &#34;It&#39;s supposed to be done by 1:30. Are you fucking braindead?&#34; B complains the workload is too much to be finished by that time, to which A response by blaming B&#39;s slow execution. B appears mortified.

**4.** The two kept working until 2:30 when they vanished. The situation returned to that of 8:00 AM.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**{{Occurence #5. Content that overlaps with the 2nd occurrence was omitted.}}**


* {{**Heading:** SCP-1278-KO-A and -B&#39;s work was constantly disrupted to hinder them from completing any work.}}

-----

**1.** D-11211 constantly disturbs what A is doing. A snaps and punches B in the face. B, fallen to the ground, denies the disruption and cries. A mutters at B that he is dense.

**2.** D-11211 disrupts B. B seems very stressed. B complains at A, but A responds with blaming and insults.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**SCP-1278-KO-B:** Ouch!

**SCP-1278-KO-A:** You fucking wankstain. (Yells) Oi, what the fuck are you on about!

**SCP-1278-KO-B:** (Sobbing, upset) Why do you keep hitting me? I&#39;m working!

**SCP-1278-KO-A:** I hit you? You hit me! Sweet mother of... Fuck, this thing&#39;s hard as it is, and your shite&#39;s making it worse, you plonker! Do you call this work? Why are you like this? Are you braindead or what?

**SCP-1278-KO-B:** I&#39;m not a plonker! I&#39;m helping you! But you don&#39;t tell me what I did good, and you only blame me for what I didn&#39;t do right!

**SCP-1278-KO-A:** Shut your gob, you shite! Do you want another fist to your face?

**{{[Omitted for simplicity]}}**

[[/div]]

**3.** B stops working and leaves through the entrance with a blank expression. A shouts at B, asking where he&#39;s going and leaves with him. The time is 2:00 PM. They do not return.

* SCP-1278-KO-A and -B seems to be unable to recognise D-11211.

[[/div]]
----
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**{{Occurrence #6 and further. Content that overlaps with the 2nd occurrence was omitted.}}**

-----

**1.** B seems more stressed as time progresses.

**2.** Overwhelmed with stress, B grabs a knife he pulled out from the tool bag, slits his throat and kills himself. This happens from Occurrence #6 to #██.

**3.** After #██, B silently helps A with an upset expression. B collapses from fatigue more frequently, and so do the following A&#39;s insults.

* SCP-1278-KO-A&#39;s behaviour remained similar in every occurrence.

**Discovery:** SCP-1278-KO was discovered while investigating the news that Kim ██(SCP-1278-KO-A) and Lee ██(SCP-1278-KO-B), who went missing in Gangseo-Gu, Seoul, were discovered on the third floor of an office building in Ansan-si, Gyeonggi-do. The two are well known to the people near [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongmyo Dongmyo]. Investigation done by [*http://scpko.wikidot.com/spy-and-yogurt MTF Unit Yota-98 (&#34;Yakult Lady&#34;)] recorded the following transcription.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

{{**Date:** 03/11/2022
**Interviewer:** Park Sang-sun (MTF Yota-98 Agent)
**Interviewee:** Jeong ██}}[[footnote]]Jeong runs ██ supermarket near Dongmyo.[[/footnote]]

----

= **{{[Start of Log]}}**

**Park Sang-sun:** Hey, have this Yakult. It&#39;s one of our new products. You look daunted. Any reason why?

**Jeong ██:** Thank you. I&#39;m just worried about my son.

**Park Sang-sun:** Why, did he break your heart or something?

**Jeong ██:** It&#39;s not that.  [[span class=&#34;ruby&#34;]]My son[[span class=&#34;rt&#34;]]SCP-1278-KO-B[[/span]][[/span]] is missing. 

**Park Sang-sun:** (Surprised) Blimey...

**Jeong ██:** He went to work in Gangseo-gu, but he&#39;s not yet coming back…  He&#39;s not even taking my calls -- It feels like I&#39;m rotting from the inside.

**Park Sang-sun:** Must be anxious if you don&#39;t see your son every day. What&#39;s he like?

**Jeong ██:** o job, helps me around in the supermarket. I give some allowance for that. He&#39;s too soft and socially awkward -- he got bullied a lot when he went to school, so I asked [[span class=&#34;ruby&#34;]]his uncle Kim ██[[span class=&#34;rt&#34;]]SCP-1278-KO-A[[/span]][[/span]] to bring my son to work to help him around with his decotile job.

**Park Sang-sun:** How&#39;s Kim ██ like? Is he an interior designer?

**Jeong ██:** Decotiles. Those square ones you put on the floor. That chap did that for twenty years. He runs a kiosk at Dongdaemun-gu when he&#39;s not working on that. A lot of blokes hate him; he&#39;s ill-tempered and stubborn, like he has a stick up his arse. He&#39;s a man of his word, though. Much better than my good-for-nothing son. Old folks like me don&#39;t like lazy guys like him.

**Park Sang-sun:** So your uncle goes around with your son, putting tiles on the floor. No news from the uncle, then?

**Jeong ██:** That lad&#39;s gone missing with my son. I trust him with my heart that he&#39;ll treat my son well... My son&#39;s not someone who&#39;ll commit a crime... But my son once said this; uncle Kim speaks too harshly and never praises him, so he can&#39;t do this anymore. He says he&#39;s doing what he&#39;s supposed to do, but I don&#39;t know. After work, he tells me he doesn&#39;t feel himself growing at all. The guy pays him 150,000 won[[footnote]]Approx. 150 USD, or 100 GBP - Translator[[/footnote]] per job, and he cannot be less thankful.

**Park Sang-sun:** Maybe you&#39;re pushing your son too hard. He could become even more antisocial, being scared like that. Think of your son -- money&#39;s important and all, but there&#39;s more important stuff too, right?

**Jeong ██:** Nope, ask the Kiosk owners there. We need money more than our health. (Sigh)
