It had happened.  Finally, after a blizzard of paperwork, a long, quiet plane ride, and a dizzying orientation, James was walking the halls of Site-17...though &#34;wandering&#34; might have been a more appropriate word.  Site-17 was much bigger than James had expected.  There weren&#39;t nearly enough directories, and the ones that did exist seemed to contradict each other.  Either that, or the newly-christened [[[SCP-2432]]] had messed up James&#39;s brain more than he&#39;d initially suspected.

He was standing in front of one of these confusing directories when someone finally noticed his distress and took pity on him.

&#34;Hey, you need some help?&#34;

&#34;Huh?&#34; James asked, whirling around to face the speaker - a security guard, who was now approaching.  He had his visor up, revealing the face of a man a little younger than James himself.  He was taller, though.  Buff, too.

&#34;Do you need help?&#34; he repeated.  &#34;You look lost.&#34;

&#34;Oh, uh,&#34; James said, with mixed embarrassment and gratitude.  &#34;Yeah.  I&#39;m trying to get to chemistry lab 102B.&#34;

The guard nodded.  &#34;Alright.  You&#39;ll need to...&#34; he closed his eyes to think for a moment, then started pointing.  &#34;Go that way, turn left at the end of the hallway, make a right at the first intersection, go down the stairs and make another right, go around the next two corners...&#34;  Then he trailed off, because he noticed the blank look on James&#39;s face.  &#34;Uh, why don&#39;t I just show you?&#34;

&#34;Thank you,&#34; he said, smiling in relief.

&#34;No problem.&#34;  Then he set off down the hall, following the directions he&#39;d been reciting.  James had to speed up a little bit to catch up with his guide&#39;s longer legs.

&#34;I guess you&#39;re new, then?&#34; the guard asked.

&#34;Uh, yeah.  To this Site, anyway.&#34;

&#34;Where were you before?&#34;

&#34;Fourteen,&#34; James said, with as much contempt as he could muster.

&#34;Ouch.  What&#39;d you do to deserve that?&#34;

&#34;Beats me.  Something in a past life, I guess.&#34;

They both chuckled, a little awkwardly.  The silence that followed after was even more awkward.

&#34;So,&#34; James interjected, a bit louder than he&#39;d meant to, &#34;uh, how long have //you// been working here?&#34;  It was dawning on James that he&#39;d never actually had a real conversation with any of the security officers at Area-14.  

&#34;Couple years.&#34;

&#34;Do you like it?&#34;

The guard shrugged.  &#34;I guess.  Not a //huge// fan of the security gig, but it&#39;s - hey, Iris.&#34;

&#34;Hey!&#34; replied a young blonde woman, heading the other direction.  James didn&#39;t notice the &#34;[[[SCP-105]]]&#34; across the back of her gray jumpsuit until she had already passed them.

&#34;Shit, that&#39;s a-&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s okay!&#34; the guard setting, putting a hand on James&#39;s shoulder.  &#34;She&#39;s cleared.  Didn&#39;t they tell you that at orientation?&#34;

Feeling foolish, James relaxed.  They had told him, and he was pretty sure he&#39;d even caught a glimpse of [[[SCP-073]]] - who he&#39;d heard was the Biblical Cain, though he didn&#39;t buy it - on his way in.  He still wasn&#39;t used to the idea of letting anomalies wander around the Site, though, mostly because he still wasn&#39;t used to the idea of anomalies that weren&#39;t Class 4 biohazards.

&#34;Sorry.  Just, coming from Fourteen-&#34;

&#34;Yeah, I know.  Most transfers take a while to adjust.  But take it from me - you&#39;re safe.&#34;  James looked into the guard&#39;s strong, smiling face for a little longer than was probably comfortable, until the guard noticed his hand was still on James&#39;s shoulder and they broke both physical and eye contact as quickly as they could.

The guard cleared his throat and resumed walking.  &#34;So, as I was saying, the security gig isn&#39;t too bad.  We don&#39;t have incidents here very often.&#34;

&#34;Thank God,&#34; James agreed.  The violent containment breaches were, of course, the thing he&#39;d miss the least about ABCA-14.

&#34;I&#39;m hoping to join a Task Force, though, next recruitment cycle.&#34;

&#34;Really?&#34;

&#34;Yeah.  Just Village Idiots or something, not one of the big ones like Nu-7.  I guess you know all about them, huh?&#34;

&#34;I know they make a lot of noise when people are trying to sleep.&#34;

The guard laughed.  &#34;Yeah, I guess they would.  You won&#39;t have to deal with that around here either.&#34;

&#34;Just keeps getting better.&#34;

&#34;Yeah, you&#39;ll love it here.  And here we are.&#34;  The guard gestured at the door to the lab.

&#34;Oh.&#34;  James turned to face his guide.  &#34;Thanks...&#34; then he read the guy&#39;s name tag for the first time, and immediately had a miniature heart attack.

&#34;Relax!&#34; the guard laughed.  &#34;He&#39;s my dad.&#34;

&#34;Oh,&#34; James sighed.  &#34;Phew, I thought this was an //Undercover Boss// thing for a second.&#34;

&#34;Nah.  When you meet Dad, you&#39;ll know it.&#34;

&#34;I will?&#34; James tried to hide his worry but didn&#39;t succeed.

&#34;He&#39;s not as scary as he sounds,&#34; the guard promised.

James nodded.  &#34;That&#39;s a relief.&#34;  He&#39;d heard some pretty [[[incident-239-b-clef-kondraki |crazy]]] [[[duke-till-dawn |stories]]] about Dr. Kondraki.  He didn&#39;t believe any of it, of course, but was still worried about whatever nuggets of truth might underlie the rumors.

&#34;Anyway, I&#39;m Draven,&#34; said Draven, offering a handshake.

&#34;James,&#34; said James, taking it.  &#34;James Talloran.&#34;
