**Updated Containment Procedures:** NTF Beta-03 is tasked with prohibiting civilians from entering Surigao Strait in the Philippines. Civilians approaching Surigao Strait are to be diverted. Despite the range of SCP-5964&#39;s anomalous effect, civilian, and government discovery of the anomaly is deemed unlikely. The Department of Ontokinetics is tasked with developing a containment procedure that hinders the effects of SCP-5964; until such procedure has been established, all Foundation personnel are required to maintain awareness of SCP-5964, and spread information regarding the &#34;Battle of Suriago Strait&#34; to the general public. 

**Description:** SCP-5964 is a phenomenon affecting the human psychosphere causing the following symptoms:
* Reports of &#34;voices&#34;.
* Hallucinations of naval warfare from an unknown era, potentially World War 2.
* When sleeping, subjects report being in a &#34;sunken ship&#34; surrounded by human skeletons, and rusted military gear.

The closer the individual is to SCP-5964-PRIME, the higher the frequency and severity of its anomalous effects. However, if an individual possesses awareness regarding SCP-5964 or anything related to the &#34;Battle of Surigao Strait&#34;, the individual will be immune to it[[footnote]] See Addendum 5964.2 for more info. [[/footnote]]. The full scope of its anomalous properties are unclear, though its range remains at a consistent 9,000+ kilometers in diameter from SCP-5964-PRIME. 

SCP-5964-PRIME are World War 2 battle ships located 6,000 meters beneath the ocean floor of Surigao, Philippines. Based on research gathered from SCP-5964&#39;s research staff, the ships in question were involved during the &#34;Battle of Surigao Strait&#34; when Japanese forces were fending off against American and Australian forces as part of the &#34;Battle of Leyte Gulf&#34;.

**Discovery:** SCP-5964 was discovered in 1945 when civilians in East Asia reported hearing voices, and hallucinations involving naval warfare. Foundation operatives were tasked to ascertain the situation[[footnote]] Though it was infeasiable due to the scope of the anomaly. [[/footnote]] and were unable to pin point the exact source of the anomaly until civilian ships reported having a higher severity of SCP-5964&#39;s anomalous effects at Surigao Strait. 

Due to this, no manned exploration attempts were made, though SCP-5964-PRIME was discovered based on records from World War 2. Containment Procedures originally involved researching a method to counteract SCP-5964&#39;s effects[[footnote]] Which was unsuccessful via multiple attempts. [[/footnote]] and prohibited civilians from entering Surigao Strait. This Procedure, however, was updated following a memo from Research Head, Dr. Del Rosario. 

**Addendum 5964.1:** Audio Log

The following addendum describes one of the interview logs taken by Dr. Del Rosario&#39;s research team to further study SCP-5964&#39;s anomalous effects.

**Interviewer:** Dr. Del Rosario 

**Interviewee:** Asterio Bautista[[footnote]] A civilian. [[/footnote]]

BEGIN LOG

//[Irrelevant information omitted]//

**Dr. Del:** What did you see or hear whilst you when you were affected by these hallucinations, and voices? 

**Asterio:** Well, I was having these hallucinations. I didn&#39;t know what they were about, but I was on this battle ship surrounded by men speaking in some kind of language I don&#39;t understand. They were, uh, yelling, and firing cannons at ships. Those ships were trying to kill us. 

**Dr. Del:** Did you report this to the medical ward? 

**Asterio:** Yeah, I did. They gave me medicine to try, and cure it but it didn&#39;t work, and I can&#39;t keep going around getting medicine for it because its too expensive. I&#39;m also too scared to tell this my family. They&#39;d think I&#39;m crazy. 

**Dr. Del:** Is there anyone else you know that has these effects? 

**Asterio:** Of course. Multiple people in my village kept getting it, and non of the doctors here know how to get rid of it. 

**Dr. Del:** Really. Asterio, are you aware of the &#34;Battle of Suriago Strait&#34;? 

**Asterio:** No, never heard about it. What&#39;s that about? 

**Dr. Del:** The &#34;Battle of Suriago Strait&#34; is about a naval warfare that happened right here in Suriago. It is one of the largest naval warfare in history. Thousands, and thousands of soldiers died during it. 

**Asterio:** Um, okay, but I don&#39;t see what&#39;s that got to do with-

//Silence for a few seconds//

**Asterio:** Hey, the voices... Their gone. How, how did you do it? 

**Dr. Del:** All you need to know is what the battle is.

If you&#39;re reading this, there is a high chance you posses awareness of SCP-5964. You also may notice you are not be getting affected by it despite its range, and for good reason.  I&#39;ve gathered my research, did multiple interviews, tests, and have come to the conclusion:

//Any human being whom is aware of SCP-5964 or the &#34;Battle of Suriago Strait&#34; will be immune to its effects.//

I know this because I&#39;ve noticed that everysingle person who know are unaware of SCP-5964, or the &#34;Battle of Suriago Strait&#34; are always affected by it. Its not random, or anything; its perfectly consistent. Meanwhile, those who are aware of it never gets affected by it. In fact, I&#39;ve checked records regarding who is assigned to SCP-5964, and noticed not a single one has reported being affected by it. 

Now, you might be wondering: Why does it work? 

To answer your question, I am not 100% certain, but this is my theory. The theory is reason why SCP-5964 is doing it is because the dead soldiers inside those ships want to be remembered. They do not want to be forgotten. They do not want to die in vain. They want to be remembered. They want to grasp for anything that can give their deaths meaning. 

By remembering who the soldiers were, and what happened during the battle, SCP-5964 will omit the affects from the affected subject. 

Of course, this is not the best solution due to the fact we are &#34;containing&#34; its effects, but not the source of it. Which is why I am requesting the O4 Council[[footnote]] A group compromised of high ranking Foundation employees designed to handle important situations that do not require the attention of the Overseer Council. [[/footnote]] to downgrade the file&#39;s clearance to Level 1, and help establish a suitable containment method for SCP-5964. 

With regards,
//Dr. Del Rosario,//
//Research Head of SCP-5964.//
