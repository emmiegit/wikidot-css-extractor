&#34;Well, the doctor said its going to be a girl!&#34;

&#34;Have you thought much about names yet?&#34;

&#34;Not really. We had a list but it&#39;s hard when you&#39;re picking for both boy and girl names. Although we can officially throw out **##green|Drew##** and **##green|Kyle##**.&#34;

&#34;Well, it&#39;s all good. You have a few months to figure it out still. I&#39;ll see you around!&#34;

&#34;Honey, is there a reason you&#39;re so set against this?&#34;

&#34;Thank you!&#34;

&#34;She&#39;s such a cute little one, isn&#39;t she? You finally decided on a name for her?&#34;

Inside of a hollow tree, a fungus fell off the wall and began to fester and grow. First it formed a leg, and then another. And then two arms with four fingers each. Bright yellow eyes pierced what soon became the head. As its mouth formed, it learned of taste. Its mind flooded with thoughts of food. Something sweet, but also bitter. Like a tea with just a little more sugar.

Yes, an **##green|Eleanor##** would be quite delectable.
