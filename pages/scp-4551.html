--------
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4451 is to be stored in an anechoic chamber[[footnote]] A soundproofed room, designed to completely absorb reflections of either sound or electromagnetic waves. [[/footnote]]. A commercially produced bell muffler is to be placed into the interior of SCP-4551 when not in testing. 


**Containment Update:** In order to control rust build-up, SCP-4551 is to be cleaned with a 20% electrolytic solution of white vinegar mixed with salt, once per day and re-cleaned after testing. This process is to be performed inside SCP-4551&#39;s anechoic chamber.

Furthermore, in order to prevent severe oxidation to occur on SCP-4551&#39;s surface, renaissance oil is to be doused daily. This oil is to be blessed by a member or decendent of Roseafar.

**Description:** SCP-4551 is an ornate iron funeral bell, constructed during the late 1300s in Roseafar, Scotland. When SCP-4551 is rung, it produces a clear note in E♭3, which causes an illusion (SCP-4551-1) to appear to the ringer for a period of up to ten minutes. [[footnote]] See the decibel rating table for more information. [[/footnote]]

SCP-4551-1 illusions appear to be incorporeal, partially-translucent figures with a physical appearance identical to a deceased individual whom the ringer had an interpersonal relationship with. 

The following has been observed during interactions between a ringer and an SCP-4551-1 illusion:

* The ringer maintains that the SCP-4551-1 illusion is the &#39;soul&#39; of a deceased individual.

* Ringers report that the SCP-4551-1 illusions converse about past memories shared between the ringer and SCP-4551-1. 

* SCP-4551-1 illusions engage in endearing behavior such as giving compliments and easung doubts when emotionally &#39;close&#39; to the ringer, and engage in negative[[footnote]] Hostile, distant and inpersonal behavior. [[/footnote]] behavior when &#39;distant&#39; to the ringer.

[[include component:image-block

    caption=An engraving of an SCP-4551-1 illusion, also from //Prayer of Roseafar//.]]

It has been observed that the time frame in which an SCP-4551-1 illusion persists for, is based upon the decibel rating that was produced. For more information, please see the table below.

[[collapsible show=&#34;SCP-4551-1 Decibel Rating and SCP-4551-1 Time.&#34; hide=&#34;Close File.&#34;]]

Please note, the following decibel ratings are rounded.

||~ Decibel rating during ringing: ||~ Length of time that an SCP-4551-1 illusion persisted for: ||
|| &lt;40 dB || No effect. ||
|| 40 dB || 4 minutes. ||
|| 60 dB || 6 minutes. ||
|| 80 dB || 8 minutes ||
|| 100 dB || 10 minutes. ||
|| &gt;100 dB || No effect. ||

[[/collapsible]]

**Update:** Rust has been documented occurring on SCP-4551, with about 3 mm^^2^^ of rust occuring daily, generally forming around the base of the bell. As of █/██/████, it has been discovered that when a human subject rings SCP-4551 while the object is rusted[[footnote]] SCP-4551 needs to have 50% of its area covered in rust for the cognitohazard to occur.[[/footnote]], a cognitohazard occurs in which the memory of a deceased individual is completely forgotten by the ringer. For more information, please see addendum no. 3. It is currently unknown what will occur if SCP-4551 is rung while fully rusted.

The //Prayer of Rosefar//, a holy book from the region, describes SCP-4551&#39;s rust effect in the following manner:



[[collapsible show=&#34;Rust and Man&#39; Transcript.&#34; hide=&#34;Close Text.&#34;]]

//Hawk! Man com and se, that such a memoy iss vieweable fore suxh a briaght momenat; but ala&#39;s my sun, my dughter, for all of God&#39;s mircles, a pric iz to be peid.//[[footnote]] Modern English Translation: Hark! Man come and see that such a memory is viewable for such a bright moment; but alas, my son, my daughter, for all of God&#39;s mighty miracles, this has such a price to pay. [[/footnote]]

//From ur fatheras, from uer mother&#39;s, dead and barrow. They &#39;old Devil&#39;s blood, stained on teh bel. Let ye thinke: Hath memory desevred bloodshed, agoeny suffreing? Thy God only know, only jusdge, when our holy gost if our loved ones comes blesed true.// [[footnote]] Modern English Translation: From your fathers, from your mothers, dead and burried. The Devil came for their blood, now stained on our bell. Let one think; Has the memory deserved bloodshed, agony and suffering? Our God only knows, only judge, when our holy ghost of our loved ones becomes blessed true. [[/footnote]]
[[/collapsible]]

**Addendum No. 1: History and Recovery Information:** 

[[&lt;]]
SCP-4551 was originally discovered in Roseafar[[footnote]] Also spelled &#39;Rosefar&#39; [[/footnote]], Scotland, a secluded and autonomous village located near the Scottish capital of Edinburgh.
[[/&lt;]]

[[include component:image-block
    name=20190421_011057.jpg |
    caption=Roseafar, Scotland.]]
[[&lt;]]
Originally a dead bell[[footnote]] A bell used by the Catholic Church in the Middle Age, used to drive evil spirits away during funerals, and offer comfort to the dead. [[/footnote]], SCP-4551 was used by citizens in the village, for religious ceremonies and festivals.
 
According to a senior member of  Roseafar, Fr. George Albert, SCP-4551 was considered to be a holy item, and was used to wish for harvests and to celebrate and revere dead members of the community. A special ceremony known as the &#39;//Gost of God&#39;// was conducted to remove rust from SCP-4551, and to prevent deceased members from being forgotten by the population of the village. This ceremony required a dying member of the community to baptize the bell. A special song was sung during the ceremony, viewable as a transcript below.
[[/&lt;]]


[[collapsible show=&#34;Gost Of God&#39; Transcript.&#34; hide=&#34;Close Text.&#34;]]

[[&lt;]]
//Maen, caome send sae aend sell dead maen Shael liea, whean that comaes based and baerre, era have noathing wean we away faed, well tha t we cares foare is worams, Escaeot flat which we dka for God&#39;s sake, wea have naothing ready but God&#39;s Goetz and a latest memy.//[[footnote]] Modern English Translation:  Man, come and see:  See how all dead men shall lie. When that comes bad and bare,
we have nothing when we away fare: all that we care for is worms:—except for that which we do for God&#39;s sake, we have nothing ready but God&#39;s ghost, and a last memory. [[/footnote]]
[[/&lt;]]
[[/collapsible]]


[[&lt;]]
Ghost&#39; sightings and reports of paranormal activity were frequent in the area surrounding Roseafar, with the local area using the sightings as a method to attract tourism to the region. These sightings had not been taken seriously until April 9th, 2005, when, during a mass offered in Edinburgh for the recently deceased Catholic Pope John Paul II, SCP-4551 was rung, triggering the appearance of 23 instances of SCP-4551-1. The presiding priest, Roseafar native Fr. George Albert, confessed to removing SCP-4551 and moving it to Edinburgh for this mass. 

Foundation agent Lilly Amarte confiscated SCP-4551 at the ceremony, and George Albert and the congregation were detained, and given class-A amnestics. 
[[/&lt;]]

**Addendum No. 2: SCP-4551 Testing Log**

Five tests were conducted with SCP-4511, viewable below. 

Currently, SCP-4551 summons SCP-4551-1 instances regardless of the ringer&#39;s place of birth.

**Addendum No. 3: Rust Test**



As SCP-4551 produces a cognitohazardous effect when rung, testing has been been put forth to judge if SCP-4451 when rusted can act as a rudimentary amnestic. The following tests had been conducted by Dr. Amie Amarte and Dr. Lucy Daniels, tested on D-4515.

**UPDATE:** SCP-4551 behaves as a rudimentary amnestic, able to produce an effect in which the ringer will completely forget the memory of the individual summoned during a rusted ringing of SCP-4551. Family members and those related are not affected. Currently, the only long term side effect is clinical depression, and periods of muteness.

**1200 Hours** //D-4515 is brought into interview room 361, meeting with Dr. Daniels, and Dr. Amarte.//

**Dr. Daniels:** Please be seated. D-4515, we have a few questions to ask you.

**D-4515:** Yes.

**Dr. Amarte:** Good. Firstly, what do you see here? (//She holds up a photo of SCP-4551.//)

**D-4515:** A bell, I guess. It looks old, very rusty.

**Dr. Amarte:** Do you remember seeing this object before at all?

**D-4515:** No.

**Dr. Parsy:** What is this to you? (//She holds up a picture of SCP-4551&#39;s Containment Chamber.//)

**D-4515:** A room, but the walls are weird, lots of angles. Never seen it before.

**Dr. Amarte:** All right then, next question. Is your mother named Beatrice Saifield?

**D-4515:** No. I don&#39;t know who my mother was.

**Dr. Amarte:** Do you have a father?

**D-4515:** My father was named Floyd.

**Dr. Daniels:** Last question, who is this, to you? (//She holds up a picture of D-4515&#39;s mother.//)

**D-4515:** I don&#39;t know who that is. I&#39;ve never seen her.

**Dr. Amarte:** I see. That is all, D-4515. We will return you back to your cell.

&gt; Dr. Amarte&#39;s Note: //It was about a year or so since we conducted the test involving SCP-4551 and D-4515. The subject seems to have completely forgotten the memory of their own mother, not even able to recognize her from a photo. How frightning... We might be able to use SCP-4551 as an emergency amnestic, but the overall scope is going to be pretty limited. Might only be for Roseafar, but I don&#39;t know just yet. I don&#39;t think it occurs with a location or memory, just a person. And besides that, the after-effects may be too severe. Yet it’s not as though there aren’t just as many ethical issues with our standard source of amnestics…  But is it //right//? I just feel a tinge guilty, erasing a man&#39;s memory from him. Imagine if the some old coot doctor done the same to me. If they made me forget her. Like I did with the man&#39;s mother. For now though.

&gt; I&#39;ll put those feelings aside. I have to talk to Daniels.//
