**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4214 is currently stored in the Foundation database, along with several digital copies. --Foundation webcrawlers are to delete any instances of SCP-4214 found on the Internet.-- No other copies of SCP-4214 exist outside the Foundation database.

No further containment procedures have been deemed necessary at this time.

**Description:** SCP-4214 is a digital image file depicting a muscular humanoid presenting what is believed to be a sealed container in its raised right hand. The image carries mild cognitohazardous properties, which manifest as a form of selective aphasia[[footnote]] Medical disorder that affects an individual&#39;s ability to communicate. [[/footnote]] when its entirety is observed by a sapient entity. This effect is also carried over to any physical copies of the image. 

SCP-4214&#39;s cognitohazardous effects cease within 12 hours, and have not been noted to leave affected individuals with any harmful secondary effects. 

**Addendum 4214.01: Recovered Chat Logs**

Foundation webcrawlers discovered and recorded chat logs believed to be relevant to SCP-4214 from a GoI-5869 (“Gamers Against Weed”) chat room, attached below.

**Addendum 4214.02: Discovery**

SCP-4214 was recovered from a gift-wrapped box mailed to Site-39. The contents of the box included a non-anomalous USB drive containing SCP-4214, as well as a non-anomalous loudspeaker that played audio of the entire 2007 Bee Movie in its entirety on loop when opened.

//[D-24601 sits in front of a monitor in a testing chamber. Dr. Carter oversees the test from the adjacent control room.]//

**CARTER:** For this one, we just need you to look at the image on the monitor and describe it as best you can. 

**D-24601:** Sure thing.

//[SCP-4214 is displayed on the monitor.]//

**D-24601:** Huh. Funky-looking art. Looks like a jibbly keggle to me.

**CARTER:** Could y-- 

//[Dr. Carter stares at D-24601 through the observation window. He is visibly confused.]//

**CARTER:** Sorry, come again?

**D-24601:** A jibbly keggle, you know? Like uh, a scrimblo bimblo, a shbabbly shwobbly, uh... Perhaps a lorex unnu?

**CARTER:** D-24601, please take this seriously. Once again, please describe SCP-4214.

**D-24601:** But I have! It&#39;s a baba booey holding a small twiggo pinga. The iccum boccum really brings it all together, if I may add. The guncrow wiggowienny looks sorta wonky, though.

//[Dr. Carter continues to stare at D-24601. He pinches the bridge of his nose and sighs.]//

**CARTER:** Alright. I think I understand what&#39;s going on here. Thank you for your cooperation, D-24601.
