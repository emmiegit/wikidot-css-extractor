**Item #:** SCP-4011

**Object Class:** --Thaumiel-- Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** The former Provisional Area-R01 has been lost. Automated lockdown procedures are in effect, and Mobile Task Force Upsilon-53 is monitoring the facility entrance. All SCP-4011-1 instances found outside of SCP-4011 --are to be destroyed on sight-- should not be approached or otherwise provoked until further notice. The SCPS Moksha was launched from Site-##Blue|205## on 2053-01-21, carrying relief forces and supplies for the establishment of Armed Area-R02. It is expected to reach Martian orbit on 2053-08-30. Should SCP-4011-1 attempt to breach automated Area-R01 defenses before the establishment of Armed Area-R02, MTF Upsilon-53 members are advised to retreat to a safe location until Foundation rescue forces arrive.

[[collapsible show=&#34;⯈ Show Previous Special Containment Procedures&#34; hide=&#34;▼ Hide Previous Special Containment Procedures&#34; hideLocation=&#34;both&#34;]]
&gt; **Notice: these procedures are outdated as of 2053-01-05.**
&gt; 
&gt; Provisional Area-R01 has been established around the entrance to SCP-4011 to facilitate exploration of the site and communication with SCP-4011-1. SCP-4011-1B and -1C instances are prohibited from leaving SCP-4011, and -1A instances must not travel beyond the isolation corridor. Mobile Task Force Upsilon-53 (&#34;Alien Robots In Space&#34;) is assigned to monitor the isolation corridor and perform regular exploration missions within SCP-4011. Before beginning scheduled explorations, the commander of MTF Upsilon-53 is to ascertain the current mental state of SCP-4011-1. Should conditions be judged unfavorable, the exploration is to be postponed.
&gt; 
&gt; Records obtained from SCP-4011-1 are to be relayed immediately to the RAISA Central Office at Administrative Site-##Blue|10##. RAISA staff may, at their discretion, administer remote amnesticization[[footnote]]Utilizing Targeted Memetic Amnestic 32T or an approved Remote Expungement Compulsion Signal, as the situation warrants.[[/footnote]] to personnel exposed to information classified beyond their clearance level.
&gt; 
&gt; ##Blue|One member of MTF Upsilon-53 is to remain within the bounds of SCP-4011 at all times. Every 24 hours, this member is to rotate out and be thoroughly debriefed by a staff member of at least 4/4011 clearance. Should an Alpha-1-7 Event be indicated, staff are to investigate and record all theorized modifications to reality.##

**Description:** SCP-4011 is a facility located within and beneath Victoria Crater on Mars. The only known entrance to the structure is an airlock hidden beneath an alcove on the northern rim of the crater. The full extent of the facility is --currently unknown-- likely to be infinite. The architecture and symbols found within the facility are similar to those of a standard Foundation site, though the materials used for construction appear to be of Martian origin.

The interior of the facility is entirely isolated from the outside, and neither traditional radio communication nor any tested anomalous communication system[[footnote]]See Testing Log 4011-C for a full record of attempted communication methods and failure modes.[[/footnote]] will allow a signal to pass between the facility&#39;s interior and its exterior. The internal atmosphere is comprised almost entirely of argon gas, with low concentrations of nitrogen and carbon dioxide.

SCP-4011-1 is the designation given to a large-scale, distributed anomalous artificial intelligence system within SCP-4011, comprised of a large number[[footnote]]The full extent of SCP-4011-1 is unknown; however, more than 3,800 unique instances were observed during Incident 4011-28.[[/footnote]] of robotic beings, each individually sapient yet also interconnected into an overall hierarchy.[[footnote]]The effect is similar to a &#34;hive mind&#34;, though it is organized into tight groupings which form a tree structure.[[/footnote]] SCP-4011 is inhabited solely by instances of SCP-4011-1, which perform various maintenance and administrative tasks. SCP-4011-1 instances show a large degree of variation in form - the 3 currently-known categories of instance have been designated SCP-4011-1A through -1C, and are described below.

[[collapsible show=&#34;⯈ Show Designation Categories&#34; hide=&#34;▼ Hide Designation Categories&#34; hideLocation=&#34;both&#34;]]
Note that recordings from Incident 4011-28 show multiple SCP-4011-1 instances which do not appear to correspond with known -1 sub-designations. As such, this table should not be considered complete.

||~ Designation ||~ Appearance ||~ Observed Function ||
|| SCP-4011-1A || Humanoid androids made of a polished, metallic material. Height tends to vary between 1.7 and 2.5 meters. Body shapes and proportions correspond to those of humans, though they lack fine detail or facial features. || General maintenance tasks and communication with other beings. Observations during Incident 4011-28 indicate that they may serve as higher-level coordinating nodes in the hierarchy, directing other instances during combat or similar activities necessitating mass organization. ||
|| SCP-4011-1B || Sets of metallic spheres, usually organized as a single larger sphere with a &#39;tail&#39; of smaller spheres extending below it. Instances vary widely in diameter, with the smallest measuring as small as 2 centimeters in primary-sphere diameter and the largest reaching 1 meter. Instances are capable of levitation and flight through unknown means, and are also capable of receiving, transmitting, and jamming signals sent through radio-frequency and ##Blue|thaumaturgic## channels, though instances are not thought to be immune to the effect of SCP-4011&#39;s boundary. || Data storage, transmission, and processing within the SCP-4011 hierarchy, as well as covert data exfiltration from and interference with external computer systems. ||
|| SCP-4011-1C || Small pyramids made of the same material as -1A and -1B instances, measuring 1 centimeter to a side. Capable of exerting an anomalous force to form materials around them into arbitrary shapes, instances have often been observed to construct &#39;shells&#39; around themselves when traveling outside of SCP-4011. Instances are capable of levitation and flight through unknown means. || Rough construction and repair tasks. Instances do not appear to be capable of fine manipulation of materials; however, individual instances have been observed carrying masses estimated at up to 12 tonnes, and they are capable of lifting larger masses through the coordination of multiple instances. ||

SCP-4011-1 has demonstrated extremely in-depth knowledge of world history (and particularly the history of the Foundation), and it has shared detailed descriptions of previously-unknown events. To date, all provided information which can be verified has proven accurate. Recovered documents have been used to discover, explain, and improve upon containment procedures for more than ##Blue|40## other SCP objects. --As such, SCP-4011 has been classified as Thaumiel, Threat-Level Orange as of 2052-08-12.-- ##Blue|Following the events of Addendum 5, SCP-4011 was reclassified as Threat-Level Black.## By O5 order on 2053-01-05, SCP-4011 has been reclassified as Keter, Threat-Level --Orange-- ##Blue|Black## and no further communication or interaction with SCP-4011-1 is permitted without direct approval from the O5 Council.

SCP-4011-2 refers to level B17 of SCP-4011 and all levels below it. ##Blue|Further information can be found in Addendum 6.##
 
[[collapsible show=&#34;⯈ Addendum 1: Discovery&#34; hide=&#34;▼ Addendum 1: Discovery&#34;]]
SCP-4011 was first discovered on 2006-09-30, when the Martian exploration vessel MER-B[[footnote]]Commonly known as the &#34;Opportunity&#34; Mars rover.[[/footnote]] photographed an artificial structure bearing the Foundation logo while exploring Victoria Crater. Foundation agents embedded in NASA were able to quickly halt the initial spread of the image, administering amnestics to exposed employees and altering the rover&#39;s planned course to prevent further encounters. 

Due to the worrying implications of an unknown Foundation-marked structure on the surface of Mars, exploration of the anomaly was deemed a moderate priority. However, remote-operated vehicle missions in 2009 and 2012 met with failure: contact with the rovers was lost immediately upon entry due to SCP-4011&#39;s communications-blocking effect, and the vehicles&#39; auto-pilot systems failed to guide them out of the facility. Manned missions were deemed impractical until the 2049 [[[three-portlands-hub|Three Portlands]]] Accord eased tensions with several groups of interest, reducing the need for Foundation orbital defenses and opening unique opportunities for collaborative efforts with certain approved anomalous entities. With the assistance of GoI-1115,[[footnote]]The cooperation of GoI-1115, Frostman Robotics (formerly [[[anderson-robotics-hub|Anderson Robotics]]] until 2044-01-01) has proven particularly useful in conducting extraplanetary Foundation operations, as agents constructed to their standards show the ability to work autonomously in hostile atmospheric conditions for extended periods of time.[[/footnote]] Provisional Area-R01 was established around the entrance to SCP-4011 on 2052-06-06.

&gt; &lt;%U53-Mallow&gt;: I have a feeling it&#39;s that or start shooting.
&gt; &lt; U53-Lily&gt;: Try a handshake protocol.
&gt; &lt; U53-Lily&gt;: HP6
&gt; &lt;%U53-Mallow&gt;: Acknowledged.

&gt; 
&gt; **1A-1:** Verified. We apologize for the formalities, #411. Your task force has been cleared for entry. Do you require assistance in accessing the archives?
&gt; 
&gt; **U53-Mallow:** First, we need to ask a few questions.
&gt;
&gt; [[div class=&#34;vcomms&#34;]]
&gt; &lt; U53-Fenn&gt;: Did the entity just mention your serial, Mallow?
&gt; &lt;%U53-Mallow&gt;: Yes. It also knows the response to [##Blue|Contact RAISA for full record##] - it could be accessing a Foundation network.
&gt; &lt; U53-Lily&gt;: I&#39;m checking our local. This channel might be compromised; recommend minimum of communication.
&gt; &lt; U53-Mallow&gt;: Approved.
&gt; [[/div]]
&gt; 
&gt; **U53-Mallow:** When was this facility built, and by whom?
&gt; 
&gt; **1A-1:** Site-32M19 was constructed by the SCP Foundation. Construction began on 18538-12 538:14 FST[[footnote]]Dates given by SCP-4011-1 are always provided in this format. Correlation with known historical events indicates that this date corresponds to 1551-03-30.[[/footnote]] and the facility was declared open on 18541-68 110:00 FST.[[footnote]]1552-11-11.[[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **U53-Mallow:** What is its purpose?
&gt; 
&gt; **1A-1:** The mission statement of Site-32M19 is as follows: &#34;To maintain a comprehensive historical archive of the SCP Foundation and its subject peoples, and to maintain the security and sovereignty of the Foundation by...&#34;

&gt; &lt;%U53-Mallow&gt;: How many?
&gt; &lt; U53-Lily&gt;: At least 200 within 15 meters. Too much traffic to identify individuals.
&gt; [[/div]]
&gt; 
&gt; **U53-Mallow:** And what is our current clearance level?
&gt; 
&gt; **1A-1:** Abridged codelist: 1/GENERAL, 3/4011 and therefore 3/Site-32M19, 2/Area-R01. Would you like a full report?
&gt; 
&gt; [[div class=&#34;vcomms&#34;]]
&gt; &lt; U53-Fenn&gt;: Those codes are accurate. Whatever this is, it knows more about the Foundation than we do. Recommend retreating for now - this information needs to get to command.
&gt; &lt; U53-Lily&gt;: Seconding. These entities outnumber us and there is a good chance that they know our killcodes. 
&gt; &lt;%U53-Mallow&gt;: Approved
&gt; [[/div]]
&gt; 
&gt; **U53-Mallow:** That&#39;s not necessary at this time. We&#39;re leaving.

Between 2052-06-12 and 2053-01-05, the RAISA Central Office received a total of 652 documents from SCP-4011-1. All documents are either large, black hard-cover books with pages in A4 size (scanned, transmitted to the RAISA Central Office, and stored on-site at Area-R01), or Foundation-Database-Protocol-compatible data files. ##Blue|Due to the sheer volume of data received from SCP-4011, analysis is still ongoing, and is not expected to be complete until May of 2054 at the earliest.##

&gt; **Document Title:** Biography of Ronald Esther
&gt; 
&gt; **Recovered:** 2052-06-15
&gt; 
&gt; **Type:** Book - 3,581 pages.
&gt; 
&gt; **Summary:** A complete biography of a prominent Serpent&#39;s Hand member, going into extremely-intimate detail regarding upbringing, philosophy, employment history, and activities as recent as 2052-06-14. Information was used to launch a raid on the subject&#39;s cell on 2052-06-20, leading to the capture of all 25 members and the disruption of a planned assault on Site-##Blue|201##.

&gt; **Type:** FDP file - standard SCP report
&gt; 
&gt; **Summary:** A document describing SCP-████. The document is similar to current Foundation documentation on SCP-████, except for the addition of a 20,532-word section labeled &#34;Origin.&#34; This section goes into exacting detail in describing the object&#39;s creation by a branch of the Church of the Broken God in 1851. Analysis of the documentation is still ongoing, and has led to the identification of several historical figures as Church members. Additionally, a previously-unknown property of SCP-████ was discovered through analysis of tests allegedly performed during the object&#39;s creation, leading to a significant improvement in containment procedures.

&gt; ##Blue|**Summary:** Volumes detail an unknown ancient civilization referred to as the &#34;Foundation under SCP.&#34; Foundation society is described as a rigid caste system, ruled over by an anonymous &#34;Council of Overseers&#34; and devoted to the containment and study of anomalous entities, in service to a deity referred to only as &#34;SCP.&#34; At its peak, the civilization is said to have encompassed over half of modern-day Europe. Various modern SCP objects are described, along with the methods which Foundation society allegedly used to contain them.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##Blue|The series also details conflicts between the &#34;Foundation under SCP&#34; and at least 53 other civilizations, including the Daevite Empire. Dates in these volumes do not agree with currently-understood histories of Daevite civilization, with the final volume concluding in a war fought between the Daevite Empire and the Foundation in 1551. This war appears to have involved a number of highly-destructive anomalous weapons, approaching modern eigenweapons in theoretical destructive potential.##

&gt; **Incident 4011-16**
&gt; 
&gt; **Date:** 2052-11-07
&gt; 
&gt; **Description of Incident:** During a conversation with Area-R01 Director Eva Waterford, Specialist Fenn demonstrated signs of memory compromise, referring to a nonexistent anomalous group named the &#34;Nation of Lodia.&#34; This conversation was recorded by Area sensors, and an abridged transcript is provided below.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Recording Excerpt, 2052-11-07 18:41 Earth-GMT&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Specialist Fenn:** I&#39;m just worried we won&#39;t have a Foundation to come home to, with the war and all.
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Waterford:** I&#39;m sorry?
&gt; 
&gt; **Fenn:** You know. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll beat the Lodians soon and everything will be fine, but... what if we don&#39;t? We might be trapped here for the rest of our lives! And then we&#39;ll have to figure out what to do when you humans start running out of supplies-
&gt; 
&gt; **Waterford:** Fenn?
&gt; 
&gt; **Fenn:** Yes?
&gt; 
&gt; **Waterford:** What are you talking about? The Foundation isn&#39;t at war with anyone.
&gt; 
&gt; //[At this point, Director Waterford activates a silent alarm, summoning Area security forces.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Fenn:** Director, the Nation of Lodia is the largest threat the Foundation has ever seen! We&#39;ve been at war for three years! How else do you explain why we came here? Why Frostman willingly helped the Foundation, after all we&#39;ve done to them?
&gt; 
&gt; **Waterford:** Command Override: ##Blue|PSREPOSE## 312.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Fenn is paralyzed by the override command as security staff enter the room. Note that he is not rendered incapable of speech.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Waterford:** Sorry, Fenn. One of us has been seriously affected by 4011. Security, place Fenn and I into isolation and raise Code ##Blue|Amber## with Command.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fenn:** Eva, we were in Site-64 when it fell![[footnote]]Fenn had been assigned to Site-64 before the formation of MTF Upsilon-53, where he had served as a research assistant for SCP-140 and SCP-3560. However, no significant containment breaches or outside hostile operations occurred during this time.[[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; //[Director Waterford is led away by security staff to an isolation cell. Specialist Fenn is carried to a separate cell.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Recording Excerpt&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Resolution:** After interrogation, similar memories were found in all members of Mobile Task Force Upsilon-53. All memories of the &#34;Nation of Lodia&#34; were expunged from task-force members using Remote Expungement Compulsion Signal E and replaced with reconstructed memories that reflect actual events. ##Blue|After the events of 2052-12-26, these memories were identified as the product of an Alpha-1-7 Event, which likely occurred during a routine exploration of SCP-4011. RECS-E was used to revert the memory modifications to MTF Upsilon-53 members.##

--Foundation analysis of this incident indicates that SCP-4011 produces a strong memetic effect, modifying the memories of exposed personnel to include false groups and events.--

##Blue|Later events contradict this theory - see Addendum 6.##

&gt; **Summary of Compiled Data: SCP-4011 Exploration 2052-12-26**
&gt; 
&gt; **Target Object:** SCP-4011
&gt; 
&gt; **Relevant Foundation Assets:** Mobile Task Force Upsilon-53
&gt; * U53-Mallow (PSHUD #411), MTF Lead
&gt; * U53-Fenn (PSHUD #412), Specialist
&gt; * U53-Lily (PSHUD #413), Technician
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** This is a summarized overview of the 2052-12-26 exploration into SCP-4011. For complete logs of video, network, and other sensory readings, contact the RAISA Central Office, extension 64011.
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Previous exploration efforts had been hindered by SCP-4011-1, who withheld information and prevented free movement of MTF members, citing insufficient clearance. In order to gain a more complete understanding of the anomaly, Upsilon-53 Lead Mallow was granted temporary 5/4011 clearance, with the understanding that this clearance was provisional and only to be used to access the SCP-4011 facility.

&gt; 
&gt; **1A-1:** Verified. We apologize for the formalities, Overseer. Your task force has been cleared for entry. Do you require assistance in accessing the archives?
&gt; 
&gt; **U53-Mallow:** That&#39;s alright, Archivist.[[footnote]]The title by which SCP-4011-1 entities request to be referred.[[/footnote]] What is my clearance level as pertains to this site?
&gt; 
&gt; **1A-1:** Overseer Mallow, your clearance codes are: 1/GENERAL, 5/4011 and therefore 5/Site-32M19, and 2/Area-R01. Would you like a full report?
&gt; 
&gt; **U53-Mallow:** That won&#39;t be necessary. Are we permitted full access to this facility?

&gt; &lt;%U53-Mallow&gt;: &#34;Minimum of communications,&#34; team. We&#39;re here to figure out where 4011-1 gets its information - let&#39;s stay focused on that.
&gt; &lt;%U53-Mallow&gt;: Lily, keep track of -1Bs. If anything is causing these memory events,[[footnote]]At this time, Alpha-1-7 Events were still thought to be the result of SCP-4011-1 modifying the memories of MTF Upsilon-53[[/footnote]] it would be them.
&gt; &lt; U53-Lily&gt;: Acknowledged.
&gt; &lt; U53-Fenn&gt;: Hold on a moment.
&gt; [[/div]]
&gt; 
&gt; **U53-Fenn:** Archivist, what&#39;s the purpose of this site, again?
&gt; 
&gt; **1A-1:** The mission statement of Site-32M19 is as follows: &#34;To maintain a comprehensive historical archive of the SCP Foundation and its subject peoples, and to maintain the security and sovereignty of the Foundation by...&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **U53-Mallow:** Archivist, you are permitted to speak the remainder of the statement.
&gt; 
&gt; **1A-1:** &#34;...retroactively neutralizing evident threats through Protocol Alpha-1-7.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **U53-Mallow:** What is Protocol Alpha-1-7?
&gt; 
&gt; **1A-1:** Apologies, Overseer. We cannot further discuss Protocol Alpha-1-7 outside of the Alpha-1 Array[[footnote]]SCP-4011-2[[/footnote]].
&gt; 
&gt; [[div class=&#34;vcomms&#34;]]
&gt; &lt;%U53-Mallow&gt;: That figures. We&#39;ll have to ask when we get down to B17.

&gt; 
&gt; **U53-Mallow:** Daevites? Do you think this is 140-related?
&gt; 
&gt; **U53-Lily:** This one is set in the 15th century, so we&#39;re already past the black-zone for 140. It also shows the Daevites in control of far more territory than expected.
&gt; 
&gt; **U53-Fenn:** Maybe this has something to do with &#34;retroactive neutralization?&#34;

[[collapsible show=&#34;⯈ Addendum 6: SCP-4011-2&#34; hide=&#34;▼ Addendum 6: SCP-4011-2&#34;]]
SCP-4011-2 is a temporal modification device, currently believed to be the reason for which SCP-4011 was built. SCP-4011-1 regularly use this device, termed the &#34;Alpha-1 Array,&#34; to purge various people and groups from existence by retroactively disrupting the circumstances which led to their creation. The entities appear to perform this procedure, which they term &#34;Protocol Alpha-1-7,&#34; to neutralize persons and groups which present an existential threat to the SCP Foundation. 

Because SCP-4011-2 acts retrocausally, it is currently not possible to detect or trace Alpha-1-7 Events. However, beings within SCP-4011 at the time of an Alpha-1-7 Event appear unaffected by it, and retain their memories of the previous timeline. SCP-4011-1 are, as such, unaffected by their own modifications to the timeline. They maintain an archive of civilizations and peoples, both in the current timeline and in those eliminated through Alpha-1-7 Events.

Through the monitoring efforts of MTF Upsilon-53, the effects of five Alpha-1-7 Events have been observed. A summary of the first encountered Alpha-1-7 Event is described below; all known information on the five observed events can be found in Supplementary Log 4011/5-2.

&gt; **Summary of Alpha-1-7 Event**
&gt; 
&gt; **Reporting Individuals:**[[footnote]]Persons who were within SCP-4011 at the time of the event.[[/footnote]] U53-Mallow, U53-Fenn, U53-Lily
&gt; 
&gt; **Target Persons or Groups:** An anomalous group called the Nation of Lodia.
&gt; 
&gt; **State Before A17 Event:** The Nation of Lodia began in 2046 as a covert society of anomalous humanoids. This society remained unknown to the Foundation until 2049, when it began to attack Foundation outposts using advanced anomalous technology. At least twelve sites were lost before the Alpha-1-7 Event in 2052.
&gt; 
&gt; **State After A17 Event:** Foundation investigatory AICs discovered evidence of the Nation of Lodia only two months after its initial founding, and a raid on 2046-11-10 led to the dissolution of the group and the capture of key leaders. No further activity has been detected from the group.

SCP-4011-1 has made frequent and vehement requests for access to SCP-140 since the events detailed in Addendum 5. In the course of these requests, it has revealed that it is unable to affect parts of the timeline overwritten by SCP-140 or destroy the object itself. 

MTF Upsilon-53 has noted that, since beginning requests for SCP-140, SCP-4011-1A instances have spoken less coherently. Requests now include an increased number of pauses and verbal glitches, as well as an increasing use of religious imagery referring to a deity called &#34;SCP&#34; (see Addendum 3). 

Following the events of Incident 4011-28, MTF Upsilon-53 are no longer able to access SCP-4011, and the Foundation is thus unable to detect further Alpha-1-7 Events.

&gt; **Incident 4011-28**
&gt; 
&gt; **Date:** 2053-01-05
&gt; 
&gt; **Description of Incident:** After the Foundation refused to transfer an SCP object to SCP-4011-1, a large number of SCP-4011-1 instances emerged from SCP-4011 and assaulted Provisional Area-R01.
&gt; 
&gt; **Abridged Timeline (all timestamps are Earth-GMT)**
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;2053-01-03 16:08&gt;:** An SCP-4011-1A instance approaches U53-Lily, who is stationed within SCP-4011 to detect Alpha-1-7 Events. The instance makes the following declaration:
&gt; 
&gt; **1A-1:** #413, we have come to a conclu- conclusion regarding SCP-140. Relay it to #411 and the Overseer Council. It is this: the object must be destroyed, lest it threaten the light of SCP. The Council of Overseers lie in the dark beyond SCP. They are unaware, and we have- have made this so. Now, the object has intertwined itself too closely with them, and the Alpha Array cannot return the Overseers to the light.
&gt; 
&gt; **1A-1:** Thus, we must ask once more: give the book- book to us. Let us destroy it. Otherwise, our orders from the Protector SCP must force our action.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;2053-01-03 20:18&gt;:** The O5 council votes unanimously to reject SCP-4011-1&#39;s request. No response to their ultimatum is provided.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;2053-01-04 17:00&gt;:** During a routine shift-change as part of SCP-4011 monitoring, U53-Mallow is prevented from entering the anomaly.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;2053-01-04 17:06&gt;:** Area-R01 is placed on alert due to unexpected action by a contained anomaly. The incident is relayed to Earth.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;2053-01-05 00:00&gt;:** Multiple -1B instances emerge from SCP-4011.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;2053-01-05 01:01&gt;:** At least 30 -1B instances are observed in the isolation corridor connecting SCP-4011 and Area-R01. All sensor feeds fail, and contact is lost with Area-R01. Further information has been reconstructed from readings gathered by MTF Upsilon-53, including broadcast messages from automated Area-R01 systems.
