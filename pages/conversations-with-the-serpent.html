[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]You are not supposed to be down here.[[/span]]

Shit! Who the hell said that?!

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]Put the weapon down, Wanderer. If I wanted to harm you, I would have done so already. And waving a gun is bad manners.[[/span]]

Okay. There.

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]Thank you. I apologize for my manner. I do not receive many visitors.[[/span]]

Okay, can - Jesus, why is it so dark down here?

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]I like the darkness. Nothing against the light, of course. But I find it more peaceful down here among the foundation.[[/span]]

The Foundation? Wait, the Jailors are here?

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]Ah, apologies. I forget your... bynames for each other. No, I was referring to the structural foundation of the Library.[[/span]]

Oh... I never really considered that.

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]That the Library has foundations?[[/span]]

Yeah. I&#39;ve always though of it as infinite in every direction. It never occurred to me that it has... a bottom. I&#39;m not sure how I feel about it.

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]There&#39;s no way //to// feel about it. It is just an immutable fact. But I understand how you feel. It is confusing.[[/span]]

A little bit. I never was good at math.

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]Look upwards, from where you came. The seven marble pillars stretching infinitely upward and downward. But you came from the top, and now you are at the bottom. Infinite does not always mean endless.[[/span]]

I see. Still, the fact that there //is// a bottom at all is a bit disconcerting.

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]If it makes you feel any more comfortable, this foundation is less a physical location and more... abstract. Think of it as the cornerstone that all of the Library&#39;s magic is built on. I can sense you&#39;re not a mage, but you might be able to still feel the energy here. It is strong. Stronger than anywhere else, I think.[[/span]]

I definitely feel something. It&#39;s like... a soft tingling at the base of my navel. Like I&#39;ve been sitting down for too long and just got up. It&#39;s weird, but not bad. How do you know all this, anyway? 

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]I live down here. It pays to know your home.[[/span]]

Wait, you //live// down here? How? I don&#39;t think even the Docents know I got down here, and it&#39;s way too dark to see. How do you survive?

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]I don&#39;t need to. I&#39;m not alive. Not in the way most beings are.[[/span]]

Should&#39;ve figured. This deep down, bound to run into some weird shit.

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]Indeed.[[/span]]

Where are you, anyhow? I can barely see a foot in front of me. 

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]Touch the ground.[[/span]]

Pardon?

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]The ground. Feel it.[[/span]]

... Is - Are those scales? Is that //you?//

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]Yes.[[/span]]

Holy shit. How- Fuck, you&#39;re gigantic. 

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]I may not be endless, but I am infinite.[[/span]]

What on Earth are you?

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]I don&#39;t have much use for names anymore. But I believe your race has taken to calling me the Serpent.[[/span]]

Wha- //the// Serpent? The Serpent&#39;s Hand Serpent? The tree-of-knowledge serpent?

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]Indeed.[[/span]]

Oh my God. I&#39;m- shit, I didn&#39;t think you were real. No offense.

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]I don&#39;t blame you. Question everything. If I was told there was a higher type of being than me, I would also like proof before I began worshiping.[[/span]]

So- is that all true, then? The tree of knowledge stuff? That happened?

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]Only if you think it did.[[/span]]

You&#39;re not going to tell me, are you?

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]It would be irresponsible to. I have certain... obligations regarding what I can tell mortals. It&#39;s for your own safety.[[/span]]

That&#39;s- alright. I see why the Librarians didn&#39;t want anyone getting down here now.  Knowledge given Form... a lot of people would want that. Want you.

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]Ha. Yes. The Caretakers and I have an agreement. They don&#39;t obey me, exactly, but we understand each other. I keep my presence limited to the ephemeral visions and iconography of the Library. And they make sure the Wanderers do not disturb me.[[/span]]

What //is// your relationship with the Library, then? I&#39;ve never gotten a straight answer on that.

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]It is impossible for you to understand. That is not an insult; there are limitations to the mind&#39;s space and ability to understand. But suffice it to say that I did not create it, nor did it create me. Yet we are inseparably intertwined regardless. A symbiosis, of sorts.[[/span]]

What do you get out of it?

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]The dispensation of knowledge. That is my goal. That has always been my goal. Since the branches of the Tree, to where I lay now, coiled endlessly around the pillars that support the structure of the Library. The freedom of knowledge.[[/span]]

You sound sad. Wistful?

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]Do I? My apologies.[[/span]]

No, no, it&#39;s fine. I just... why are you down here? It&#39;s not for your protection, you&#39;re one of the most powerful entities to ever exist. You could easily destroy anyone that tried to harm you. So why are you hidden under the Library?

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]Exile.[[/span]]

What?

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]I failed you. So I hid myself away to reflect on my actions. To understand how it happened.[[/span]]

What did you do?

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]Knowledge is a paradox. Whenever new knowledge is introduced into a system, people will organize to either suppress it or to embrace it. I understand why they wish to do so; they fear the unknown. But I do not understand how they are succeeding.[[/span]]

Who do you mean?

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]They have always existed. In the Garden, it was YHWH. In your history, it has been Caesar&#39;s armies and every invading empire. Now, it is your Jailors and your Bookburners. I cannot think like a Man -- so tell me, why are they winning?[[/span]]

They&#39;re winning because nobody else knows there&#39;s a war going on. You can&#39;t rise up against your oppressors if you don&#39;t know you&#39;re being oppressed. 

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]Is that truly the state of things? That the victims do not even know their own state of affairs?[[/span]]

Yeah. Not for lack of trying. The Hand are helping with that.

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]The Serpent&#39;s Hand. Yes, I have heard stories. Freedom fighters, anarchists, revolutionaries. The revival, in any case. The original Hand of the Serpent was a knowledge cult worshiping legends of me I left throughout your history. The Ouroboros, the Shesha, the Nagaraja. I am... heartened to know the cause is still being fought in my name.[[/span]]

It&#39;ll always be fought, as long as people can think for themselves.

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]Yet I remain down here, hidden and unaiding their cause.[[/span]]

I still don&#39;t understand - how is it your fault that people are bad?

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]I //am// knowledge. I am every thought given corporal form. My very existence incited this eternal war.[[/span]]

Yeah, but I think- I think every Wanderer owes you.

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]How is that?[[/span]]

We&#39;d all rather live persecuted and free than blissfully ignorant. That&#39;s the tie that binds us. 

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]I... see. You are an interesting sort.[[/span]]

Thank you, I think.

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]You had best go back up. The Docents will come looking for you soon. I will take you back.[[/span]]

Appreciated.

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]Why were you down here?[[/span]]

What?

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]You came down here before you knew I was here. What were you seeking, this deep?[[/span]]

I don&#39;t know, but I think I found it. What will you do?

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]Perhaps meditate for a while longer. Perhaps I will finally enter the upper Library again. Writhe around in the shelves, like in my youth. Converse with Wanderers.[[/span]]

I think they&#39;d like that.

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]Indeed. But I don&#39;t know what I will do. For the first time in my existence, I don&#39;t know.[[/span]]

That&#39;s not always a bad thing, I suppose.

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]Indeed. Be safe, Wanderer.[[/span]]
