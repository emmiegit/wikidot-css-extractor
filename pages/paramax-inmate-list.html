At the request of the Attorney General, this document has been prepared to collate and summarize the arrest and detention records of certain prisoners incarcerated at the United States Penitentiary, Paranormal ADX, who have been identified as being of particular interest to the Domestic Security Council. This list is based on an abridged version of the inmate register, supplemented with information from the Bureau&#39;s case files; it is not a copy of the Warden&#39;s Master Custody Log. This list is subject to ongoing revision to reflect the briefing needs of the Domestic Security Council.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Submit New Entry?&#34; hide=&#34;Submission Guidelines&#34;]]
[[&lt;]]
This list is an open collaboration log that anyone can contribute new entries to. While the main Paramax dossier is part of the Third Law canon, this page is not, and entries here are not required to follow any specific canon or continuity -- it is even possible for there to be entries that contradict each other.

A few things to keep in mind when adding new entries:
* Paramax is primarily an American facility -- while it does hold some prisoners from other countries, especially ones in North and South America, the majority of inmates are going to be American or otherwise subject to American jurisdiction.
* Paramax is a //prison// -- With few exceptions, everyone in Paramax has been convicted of a crime. It is not a holding facility for persons awaiting trial, and especially not for persons who have not been accused of a crime.
* Paramax is for paracriminals -- Inmates in Paramax are there because either their nature or the nature of their crimes makes it impossible to keep them in a conventional prison without compromising the integrity of the Veil. That can mean parahumans who have committed normal crimes, or it can be normal humans who have committed paracrimes.

To add a new entry to this page, copy and paste the code from the template below and insert it into the appropriate section of the table above, making sure to fill out all of the fields, and then leave a comment on the discussion page explaining your addition. If you&#39;re worried about breaking the table, you can also just leave a comment on the discussion page with your suggested new entry.

[[code]]
|| Name || Year-Year || Crime committed || Summary of additional information. ||
[[/code]]

For the name, give the full name of the inmate, if it&#39;s known, or use the most common alias if it isn&#39;t known. If the inmate is better known under an alias, or if there is some comment needed to clarify their identity, do so in parentheses after the name. If you&#39;re struggling to come up with name, try using a random name generator like the one provided by [https://www.behindthename.com/random/ Behind the Name].

Try to make the length of sentences reasonable for the crimes committed (you can look up the penalties for similar real crimes if you need inspiration). If the sentence hasn&#39;t been finished, just leave the second year blank. If the sentence is a life sentence, remember to put it in **bold**. If the inmate died in prison, don&#39;t forget to put a dagger (†) after the second year.

For the reason the inmate is incarcerated, try to pick one or two short descriptions of the worst or most significant crimes. If there&#39;s a paranormal component to the crime, you might want to describe or hint at it here.

For the additional notes, try to give a very brief overview of why this inmate is notable. This can cover their specific crimes, what paranormal abilities they have (if any), how they were captured, or what their eventual fate was. Try not to make this section longer than four sentences.

This page is curated by [[user GreenWolf]], who will regularly prune bad additions and add good suggestions from the discussion page. He has final say on what is and isn&#39;t a good entry. If, for some reason, he is unavailable to do curation, custody of this page falls, in order, to [[user TyGently]], [[user ch00bakka]], [[user A Random Day]], [[user Taffeta]], [[user Jacob Conwell]], and then to MAST.
