**Item #:** SCP-1595

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation agents embedded in archaeological services, media outlets and intelligence agencies are to identify and isolate possible instances of SCP-1595 in order to limit public exposure to them, with an emphasis on professionals who might identify the historical discrepancies inherent to SCP-1595. Portable instances of SCP-1595 are to be transferred into Foundation custody, while stationary instances are to be documented and deleted. Use of Class-C amnestics is authorized when necessary.    

**Description:** SCP-1595 is a series of numbered messages originating from various time periods and locations. SCP-1595&#39;s anomalous properties stem from their anachronistic nature; instances of SCP-1595 will often be written using methods which should not be available in the time period or location from which they originate, and are always in modern English. SCP-1595 messages are internally serialized, and each instance discovered will follow the one found before it, despite sometimes being written centuries earlier.

Additionally, analysis of the handwriting used in SCP-1595 messages indicates that they have been composed by the same person, regardless of the aforementioned chronological discrepancies. Of the sixty-seven messages found so far, fifty-three have been addressed to the same person, an unknown woman named &#34;Molly&#34;. Of the remaining messages, three address a &#34;Danny&#34;, two address a &#34;Ben&#34;, four have an unknown addressee, and five are mostly illegible.  

**Addendum SCP-1595-A:** The following is a list of notable instances of SCP-1595:

&gt; **Approximate date of writing:** 1700&#39;s 
&gt; 
&gt; **Recovered:** 1920
&gt; 
&gt; **Message:** I know you&#39;re out there somewhere, Molly. Come back, it doesn&#39;t have to end this way. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** The ██████ mausoleum was sealed after the death of the last of the family. 

&gt; SCP-1595-3
&gt; 
&gt; **Origin:** Written in permanent marker on a copy of a Gutenberg Bible, recovered from the Papal Archives.

&gt; **Origin:** Inscribed on the walls of a cave in the ████ mountain range. Originally recovered by the ████████ expedition.

&gt; 
&gt;  **Note:** This message is unique in that it was not written manually. Instead a type of laser cutter was used.

&gt;    
&gt; **Message:** You went to them? Them, of all people? That takes guts, I&#39;ll give you that. It won&#39;t be enough though, not even where you are. Or rather, when you are. They can&#39;t protect you, not ever.

&gt; 
&gt; **Message:** Can you hear the ticking, Molly? I hear it all the time, nowadays. It was irritating, at first, but I got used to it. You&#39;d be surprised, the things you can get used to if you have to. Like the cage they must have put you and the kids in. How could you do that to them? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** In addition to the body, the tomb contained three hundred (300) ivory beads, one hundred and fifty (150) fox teeth, and the remains of a .38 Smith &amp; Wesson Special. A bullet belonging to the same firearm was found embedded in the skeleton&#39;s femur.
