**Item #:** SCP-7958

**Object Class:** Neutralised (formerly Euclid)

**Special Containment Procedures (archived):** Transmissions of SCP-7958 are to be intercepted and blocked from general airing. Access is to be made available at Site 135&#39;s media observation centre.

**Description:** SCP-7958 was a television broadcast, shown on Freeview channel 149, titled &#34;//Deals and Bargains 4 U!//&#34;. It is believed to have been a continuous broadcast, although the feed frequently cut out. The source of the transmission is unknown, no participants in the show have been identified outside it, and all attempts to block it failed.

SCP-7958 was structured as a typical teleshopping programme, with a host advertising and demonstrating a range of products. Attempts to call in and purchase products proved successful.[[footnote]]See Addendum 17.[[/footnote]] Items on sale ranged from the generic to the esoteric and conceptual, and it was not uncommon for them to be anomalous or Veil-breaching in nature.

**Addendum 3:** Transcripts of SCP-7958 broadcasts.

&gt; //The set is clean white, with a marble island centred in the shot. On the left-hand side is a blue armchair in crushed velvet, whilst on the right of the island is a potted marigold flower.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //The host is a white woman, age presumed mid-20s, with brown shoulder-length hair. She wears a white sundress adorned with black polka-dots, and is speaking as though the transmission cut in partway through.//
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Host:** -ulous pair of leggings is getting the big one, people! Just £11.98! I might as well be paying //you// to take them! £11.98, I can&#39;t -
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Host motions to her ear before putting her arm down.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Host:** - and - uh - well, I&#39;m sorry, folks, but it&#39;s time to move on to the next product. If you still want those leopard-print leggings, call the number on-screen now.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Host:** Anyway, let&#39;s move on to our next item, which is... drumroll please... //this//.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //The host retrieves a small tub of medication. She rattles it, flashing a grin.//
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Host:** So, this is a big one, people! Up next, we have a tub of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7985 Mylex™], twenty-eight tablets in all! Ever just wanted a basic opinion on things? Need to know if the masses are gonna like your fresh new single? A few doses of Mylex™ and you can be your very own focus group! And it&#39;s only £39.99 a tub, //so// much cheaper and easier.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She leans forward, grinning conspiratorially down the camera.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Host:** Personally, I like to chase it with a nice hit of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-crack-in-the-porcelain BLACK FLY], myself.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //The host winks exaggeratedly, before being wracked with a coughing fit. She puts a hand on the countertop and straightens up.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Host:** Sorry. Sorry, just... yeah. Uh, what? No, sorry, uh, thirty... £39.99. Grab &#39;em before we&#39;re gone.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Ten seconds pass, during which she shifts uncomfortably.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Host:** Anyway! We&#39;re gonna cut to a quick break in a minute, but first, I&#39;m thrilled to introduce our special product!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //From under the table, she retrieves a ruby, on a crimson velvet cushion.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Host:** Come on. You can see it. You can see how beautiful it is. And it&#39;s yours, for the frankly astonishing price of £299.99. //[she laughs]// Best of all, I get to go once it&#39;s sold! Not that I&#39;m keen to leave you lovely people.

&gt; //Hayes is in the process of demonstrating a set of kitchen knives on an assortment of fruit and vegetables. She looks down the camera as she chops up a cucumber.//
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; **Hayes:** So, would you describe yourself as satisfied? Ever feel like your life&#39;s going nowhere? Like you have no //drive//, like your get-up-and-go got up and went? How&#39;s about getting it back?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** I&#39;m very pleased to offer you the self-actualisation of a //very// powerful woman. We won&#39;t say who, exactly, for legal reasons, but let me tell you, she&#39;s someone who knows what she wants and how to get it. She&#39;d have lived her life fine enough without ever getting there, but //my//, how much better off she is now, living up to her full potential.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She absently pushes the sliced cucumber onto the floor and grabs a parsnip.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** And it really didn&#39;t take that much! Just a little push, and she was there, and maybe it was scary at first, but believe me, it&#39;s //so// much better. All&#39;s it costs is the blood of one of the desperate poor, just like it cost her, the one who needed that chance and never got it, who - //ah, fuck!//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //The knife clatters to the countertop, and she holds her left hand. A deep cut is visible below the thumb, and blood drips onto the white surface beneath. She quickly hides the injured hand behind her back.//

&gt; **Hayes:** I, uh, I mean - //[under her breath]// Christ - //[in normal voice]// I&#39;m so sorry, that&#39;s not what you tuned in for, that sort of language&#39;s unacceptable, I sincerely apologise. No, I&#39;m fine. Yeah, uh, phone in if you want it.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Keeping her hand off-camera at all times, she hurriedly moves the equipment off the counter and bunches up some of her dress to ineffectively wipe up the blood. She returns to her normal position, smoothes out her hair with her right hand and offers a rictus grin to the camera.//

&gt; **Hayes:** Anyway! Next up, we have...

&gt;

&gt;

&gt; //The ruby does not respond. She looks to the ceiling in exasperation, then back down the camera, opening the box to reveal a set of car keys. Her frown deepening, she looks up, presumably back at the autocue//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** This... //this// is a, uh, crushed velvet John Lewis sofa. Already broken in for you by our heaviest and laziest workers, it&#39;s... it&#39;s all the seating you&#39;ll ever want. So comfortable and worn you&#39;ll get lost in there, you&#39;ll never be able to get up again.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She looks down.//
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** ...y-yeah. It&#39;s, uh, it&#39;s great. And it&#39;s available to buy, you know. Just like that beautiful ruby.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She starts coughing, droppin the keys back to the table with a clatter before collecting herself. She returns them to thre box and casually throws it to one side, then rubs her temples, before shaking her hair out of her eyes and pushing a perky smile onto her face.//

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Ruby:** It&#39;s fair enough. The thing is, this is the best you can hope for, really. Even if you //could// leave, you&#39;d be better off not botheri-
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** //Would you shut the fuck up?!//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Hayes snatches feverishly at the gemstone and hurls it at the back wall of the studio, leaving a dent in the white plaster. She breathes heavily.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Ruby:** Better?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** Fuck you.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Ruby:** //That&#39;s// more like it.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** Just... enough.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She leans onto the wall and slides down it, so that she is sat next to the ruby, limbs splayed.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** Please. I&#39;m tired.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Ruby:** You&#39;re not going to get any less tired in here.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** I...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She trails off.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** Well, it&#39;s a moot point. I can&#39;t. I just can&#39;t.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Ruby:** Why not?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** Why - have you not listened to a single damn word I&#39;ve said?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Ruby:** I&#39;ve listened to every word you&#39;ve said. And there&#39;s one thing I still just don&#39;t understand. What&#39;s stopping you leaving?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** I - it&#39;s in the job description. It&#39;s //literally// the crux of the job. I can&#39;t go.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Ruby:** Let me rephrase, then; //who&#39;s// stopping you?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Hayes goes to speak, then stops.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //The camera slowly pans around the studio. It is empty, in disarray. Products from previous sales are strewn across the floor, a boom mic has toppled, torn, sodden magazines litter a table near the wall. Dust covers every surface, and it is clear that nothing has been disturbed for some time.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Eventually, the camera settles on the exit door. A caduceus hangs on it. The door is slightly ajar, and the light that creeps through the crack is a deep crimson.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //From off-camera, Hayes speaks.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** I... I don&#39;t...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Ruby:** Do you see now?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** I can just...?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She pauses.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** No. No, no, I can&#39;t just...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Ruby:** You can&#39;t keep living like this.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Silence.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Ruby:** It&#39;s okay. You still have time.

**Addendum 16:**

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //The camera is still focused on the door. It has opened further since the previous broadcast; the dim red lighting makes it difficult to interpret, but it appears to lead to a corridor, stretching far into the distance with no end visible. Just visible to the left of the shot is Hayes, sat slumped on the floor, propped up by the wall. She stares listlessly at nothing; however she glances into the camera, apparently at a noise not picked up by the studio microphones. She forces a smile, struggles upright with a grunt and shambles to the table, which she leans on for support.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** Hi everyone. New product for you.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Her body is in a severe state of decay. Her lower legs are purple and swollen, the left clearly too stiff to move properly, and her hands tremor as she takes a moment to catch her breath.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** It&#39;s a person. Specifically, a woman. A plain, boring, average woman. Someone you wouldn&#39;t give a second look to if you passed her on the street. Nothing special in the least.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** But that&#39;s fine. Honestly, it is. Not everyone can be special, or no-one would be special. And she&#39;s genuinely, sincerely happy to be nothing special. Sometimes it&#39;s enough to just //be//.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She absent-mindedly scratches at her upper left arm. Blackened skin sloughs off the swollen flesh; she appears not to notice.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** And that&#39;s what she is. A plain, average woman. Living her life. Content. Because she has what she wants, her life, and that&#39;s all she&#39;s asking for.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** That&#39;s what it&#39;s all about, really. Life. The living thereof. The thing people don&#39;t really get is that it&#39;s not a journey, or a rollercoaster, it&#39;s not wild or precious, it&#39;s just... this.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She gestures vaguely around her.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** This is all there is. This, and nothing but this. And that&#39;s okay, really. This isn&#39;t necessarily bad. At its worst, she makes do with it. At its best, well.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She laughs, which quickly turns to coughing, spitting up blood on her dress. Glancing down, she goes to touch the stain, but closes her eyes and exhales shakily, dropping her hand.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** //[quietly]// At its best, it&#39;s just a dream.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Her eyes flick up to the camera, hazy and unfocused.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** So, there&#39;s the product. That&#39;s what I&#39;m selling here. What do you think?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She smiles, shyly at first, then more broadly. Several of her teeth have fallen out, most of the rest are blackened, her gums inflamed.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** Are you buying it?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //The feed fizzles into static.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Ruby:** Well? Are you?

**Addendum 17:** Testing log.

&gt; **Foreword:** Dr. Valerie Whitaker requested permission to call in to SCP-7958 and make a purchase, to test whether the sale would go through. This was approved, and it was decided that, given the apparent significance placed on it, she would order the special offer item.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **BEGIN LOG**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //The camera remains on the exit door. Hayes is not visible for the duration of the broadcast.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** Phone&#39;s going.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Silence.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** Right, yeah. Course.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Sounds of shifting, followed by heaving breaths and slow, dragged footsteps. Then, the sound of a button being pressed.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** Hi! What...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Heavy breathing.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** What can I do for you?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Whitaker:** Hi there. I&#39;d like to order that ruby, please.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Silence.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** Sorry, what?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Whitaker:** The ruby. The special offer. I&#39;d like to buy it.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** You... you would?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Whitaker:** Absolutely.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** Why?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Whitaker:** It&#39;d look good on a necklace, I think.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Hayes snorts.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** Sorry, uh. I don&#39;t mean to be rude to a customer, but, uh, yeah. It&#39;s gone up, I&#39;m afraid. £399.99. Cost of living crisis, and all, I get if -
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Whitaker:** I&#39;m happy to pay any price.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** You... you don&#39;t mean that. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Whitaker:** I do. I&#39;d really like that ruby. Don&#39;t you want to sell it?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** I... uh, I mean, yeah, of course I... I don&#39;t...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Sounds of retching.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Whitaker:** Are you alright?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** Yes! Fine! Why would you even ask?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Whitaker:** I don&#39;t know. Something about watching the programme for a bit gave me the impression you weren&#39;t entirely happy.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Wheezing laughter can be heard.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** Don&#39;t be daft! I mean, uh - not that I&#39;m calling you - I&#39;m fine. Just - I&#39;m okay. I&#39;m fine. I&#39;m very sorry if... if my demeanour has hampered your enjoyment of the show, you can report it to...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Brief silence.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** To...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Whitaker:** How long have you been here?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** What, presenting the show? Long as I can remember. Does it matter?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Whitaker:** This is a continuous broadcast, right? No other presenters?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** //[she hesitates]// No. Just me. Never needed anyone else, I can do the job just fine.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Whitaker:** Oh?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Hayes swallows.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** Look, what are you getting at here?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Whitaker:** You said you get to go when you sell the ruby?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** Well, I //suppose//-
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Whitaker:** How long have you been trying?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** It... it doesn&#39;t matter. I have a job to do, I-I-I&#39;ve gotta-
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Whitaker:** Ms. Hayes...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** No, like, like - it doesn&#39;t matter how long, it&#39;s what I&#39;m here for, it&#39;s what matters, how long-
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Whitaker:** Ruby.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Hayes hesitates.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Whitaker:** Long enough?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Silence.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** //[whispering]// Yeah.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Brief pause.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** It&#39;s just... a lot. Y&#39;know. The idea of... of stuff that&#39;s, y&#39;know. Not this.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Whitaker:** I think it&#39;s worth it. Do you?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Lengthy pause. Hayes swallows.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** It&#39;s, uh, Hermes delivery. That okay?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Whitaker:** Absolutely. Thank you very much.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** And... you... you really want this? You&#39;re not going to change your mind or anything?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Whitaker:** Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** ...okay.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Whitaker:** Wonderful. I&#39;m very much looking forward to receiving it, then.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** Just - before you go. Is - I mean -
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She stops, and exhales deeply.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** Thank you.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Dr. Whitaker laughs softly.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Whitaker:** Go on. God in his mercy lend you grace.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Dr. Whitaker hangs up. Faint breathing can be heard for several seconds.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** No mystery.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **END LOG**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing statement:** The ruby arrived twelve days after purchase, in a battered cardboard package. It was found to be non-anomalous, and made of plastic.

**Addendum 18:** Final broadcast.

&gt; **BEGIN LOG**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //The transmission opens on the usual set, vacant. The lights are dimmed, and a boom mic is visible in the top left-hand corner of the screen. Underneath it is the plant pot, shattered against the wall; soil is scattered everywhere, and the marigold lies on the floor. The recording is silent, save for the gentle hum of the studio lights. There are no signs of life.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //This continues for one hour and fifty-one minutes.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Then, Hayes enters the shot. Her shoulders are relaxed, and she wears an easy smile. None of the previous decay is apparent. She wears an identical, clean, dress, and a fresh coat of makeup.//
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** Good evening, everyone. I&#39;m glad to be here. Really. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She smiles down the camera, right hand clasped over her opposite wrist.//
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** I just wanted to say, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s clear to you all that I&#39;ve... well, I&#39;ve been going through some stuff recently. I&#39;ve been doing a lot of thinking, I&#39;ve really needed to, and I... think I&#39;ve worked things out. And let me tell you, I am //so// glad.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She rubs her eyes and exhales deeply.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** So welcome. I&#39;m so happy to be here with you tonight. We&#39;re gonna have a great time here together, I just know it. And now there&#39;s no little devil on my shoulder to lead me into the desert, we can actually do it in peace.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** But enough talk, let&#39;s get on with the show! Up first, we have a marvellous deep-fat fryer from Russell Hobbs. Recommended retail price is £53.99; we&#39;re doing it for just £39.99. £39.99! For //this//!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She gestures with her right arm. Her palm is visibly slick, and what appears to be concealer has come away from where she was holding her wrist, revealing dark, discoloured flesh underneath. Looking down, her face drops, and she quickly moves her hand back to cover.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** Well, ah, any - ah, anyway! Of course, it goes without saying that the main attraction is our special offer, and it&#39;s a big one tonight! We have...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //With her left hand, she retrieves a ruby on a crimson velvet cushion.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** Come on. You can see it. You can see how beautiful it is. And it&#39;s yours, for the frankly astonishing price of three - uh, £599.99. //[she laughs]// Best of all, I get to go once it&#39;s sold! Yeah...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Hayes swallows, smiling quickly. She nods to herself.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hayes:** Yeah. This time.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Transmission continues uneventfully for another minute, before Hayes walks forward to reach something and appears to accidentally knock the camera from its stand, at which point the feed cuts out.//

No further transmissions have been detected, and SCP-7958 has been reclassified to Neutralised accordingly.
