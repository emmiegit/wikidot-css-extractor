**Item #:** SCP-2486

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2486 is stored in a standard lockbox at Site-73. SCP-2486-A are housed at Site-17, or at other sites as necessary for testing procedures.

Generalized inter-anomaly testing with SCP-2486 has been approved as of 2016-05-05. SCP-2486 itself may not be used on Foundation personnel or anomalous items. See Addendum for further information.

Subjects should be sedated prior to strangulation with SCP-2486.

**Description:** SCP-2486 is a 1.8m length of monofilament fishing line. When SCP-2486 is used to strangle a human being, the subject will reanimate four seconds after death, recovering from any internal and external injuries incurred during the strangulation. Subjects that reanimate this way are designated SCP-2486-A. Repeated application of SCP-2486 continues to affect subjects in this manner, but imparts no other anomalous properties.

SCP-2486-A exhibit no unusual behavior apart from an intense fondness for the consumption of pomegranates. Testing has shown that the consumption of any part of the pomegranate results in a massive spike of endorphins in SCP-2486-A; this effect has been replicated by injecting small amounts of pomegranate juice into the bloodstream. Left unchecked, most SCP-2486-A will develop a psychological dependency on pomegranates.

Subjective assessments and descriptions of SCP-2486-A frequently incorporate imagery related to pomegranates. Additionally, individuals experiencing severe delusions or hallucinations may perceive SCP-2486-A as a very large pomegranate.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Show excerpts from Experiment Log 2486-C3&#34; hide=&#34;- Hide excerpts&#34;]]
For this experiment, five volunteers were shown camera footage of D-2486-022 and asked to describe him. SCP-2486 was then used to strangle D-2486-022, and the volunteers were then asked to reassess him.

Prior to strangulation:
* &#34;Seems like the kind of guy who&#39;s had a hard life. I&#39;ve seen that glare before.&#34;
* &#34;Tall, long brown hair, some tattoos. Mid-50&#39;s. Probably has to use the bathroom.&#34;
* &#34;He looks like an asshole.&#34;
* &#34;He&#39;d kill you as soon as look at you. He looks like he&#39;s anxious about something.&#34;
* &#34;The facial tics suggest long-term use of anti-psychotics, right? I remember hearing that somewhere. Looks like he needs to piss.&#34;

After strangulation:
* &#34;If you worked hard, I bet you could find the seeds of his hardship, and there would be a lot of them. His eyes are kind of red.&#34;
* &#34;Tall, long brown hair, some tattoos. Mid-50&#39;s. Full of juice.&#34;
* &#34;He still looks like an asshole.&#34;
* &#34;It seems like he has a sour demeanor.&#34;
* &#34;Still been on anti-psychotics for a while. If you squeezed him, piss would come gushing out.&#34;

**Addendum:** SCP-2486-A have been found to be affected by several anomalous objects in an unusual fashion. With the approval of O5-07, SCP-2486-A have been incorporated into scheduled testing of several contained anomalies, as the observed risk of dangerous cross-contamination is low. Below is a list of anomalous items with which SCP-2486-A have been found to interact abnormally.

**[[[SCP-1724]]]:** SCP-1724 returned a score of 001 when used on SCP-2486-A-080, then produced the phrase &#34;That can&#39;t be right.&#34; SCP-2486-A-080 experienced no deleterious effects. SCP-1724 remained non-functional for four days thereafter.

**[[[SCP-978]]]:** Five instances of SCP-2486-A were photographed with SCP-978 in their cells. Two were shown consuming pomegranate seeds in their cells. A third was shown asleep. A fourth was shown using a knife to slit his throat, with pomegranate seeds spilling out and falling onto a recreation of Leonardo da Vinci&#39;s //Vitruvian Man//, also composed of pomegranate seeds. A fifth was shown reuniting with friends and family while consuming a whole pomegranate.

**[[[SCP-2221]]]:**[[footnote]]Test was accidental: Screening of incoming D-class personnel failed to identify D-2486-119 as a member of 2221-A prior to SCP-2486 exposure.[[/footnote]] After exposure to SCP-2486, the subject&#39;s preferred religious imagery incorporated pomegranates where it would otherwise incorporate nooses. Copies of SCP-2221 found at least three days after this exposure were found to contain an additional clause:
&gt; **Clause 218**
&gt; &#34;You agree that under no circumstances will worship, prayer, obeisance, sacrifice, oaths, requests for guidance and/or intervention, or any other invocations of divinity directed at any deity or deities listed in Appendix H.vii contain pomegranates or pomegranate products.&#34;
Following the addition of this clause, SCP-2486-A instances did not incorporate pomegranates into religious imagery.

**[[[SCP-228]]]:** An instance of SCP-2486-A was shown SCP-228, which was then photographed. The result is available [https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-2486/pompomweiweiwei.png here].

**[[[SCP-1528]]]:** SCP-1528 was applied to SCP-2486-A-213, who has no visual abnormalities. Subjects who observed SCP-2486-A-213 frequently made direct comparisons to pomegranates when providing descriptions of anything. All professed great fondness for pomegranates, though several who disliked pomegranates were visibly uncomfortable while consuming them.

**[[[SCP-1379]]]:** In addition to the typical effects of insulting SCP-1379, the subject coughed up pomegranate juice for thirteen minutes afterwards.

**[[[SCP-832]]]:** A subject exposed to both SCP-832 and SCP-2486 described the value of a pomegranate as &#34;impossible to quantify&#34;. Stock in companies that have substantial financial interest in pomegranate farming or pomegranate products were described similarly. The subject attempted, unsuccessfully, to disregard all pomegranates in its field of vision.

**[[[SCP-158]]]:** When used on SCP-2486-A-081, SCP-158 extracted a pomegranate instead of the typical substance. This had the usual effect of eliminating higher brain functions in the subject. When SCP-158 was used to insert a different pomegranate into SCP-2486-A-081, the subject recovered fully. Using SCP-2486 to strangle an individual already subject to SCP-158, then using SCP-158 to insert a pomegranate, failed to return brain function to the subject.
