**Item #:** SCP-7810

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Additional copies of SCP-7810 are to be confiscated and contents photographed upon discovery. Personnel handling SCP-7810 are prohibited from reading its contents, except with testing pre-approval. Entities E-7810-01 through -174 are to be contained in habitats containing sufficient terrestial and aquatic ecosystems appropriate for their species. During testing, SCP-7810&#39;s 175th chapter is forbidden from being read. Should HK-E-7810-14 be realized, she must be praised immediately. Individuals who summoned HK-E-7810-14 must be relocated to the nearest body of water.

**Description:** As of March 15th, 2028, SCP-7810 is a 175 chapter non-fiction book, published in 1800 CE titled &#34;Ducks. Ducks? Geese? GEESE! SWANS!?!?&#34; subtitled &#34;A Guide to the Featherly Host and How to Survive&#34;. SCP-7810 is credited to Drake M. Gosling[[footnote]] Foundation historians were able to identify 15 Drake M. Goslings and one Ryan Gosling, none of whom can be traced to SCP-7810. [[/footnote]] and published by Mallard Books, a supposed subsidiary of Penguin Books.[[footnote]] Penguin Books was founded in 1935. [[/footnote]] Seventy copies of SCP-7810 have been discovered by the Department of Acquisition and Liquidation as of March 15th 2028 in 58 different major and regional languages and dialects.

174 of SCP-7810&#39;s chapters are dedicated to the documentation of all 174 extant species of the bird family Anatidae, referred to frequently as members of &#39;The Holy Fowl&#39;, &#39;The Featherly Host&#39;, and &#39;The Celestial Feathered Ones&#39;. Descriptions of each species matches baseline physical characteristics, with the exception of height and weight. Behavior, environmental, and psychological descriptions of each species are anomalous. Upon reading a chapter of SCP-7810, the species described within will manifest into baseline reality. These entities are thus labeled as E-7810-01 through 174, with the second number indicating which chapter of SCP-7810 triggered their manifestation.[[footnote]][[span style=&#34;color:#006603&#34;]] Doland be praised. [[/span]][[/footnote]] Each recovered instance of SCP-7810 has slight variations to its chapters, theorized to be a result of cultural drift, local folklore, and anomalous circumstances. Additionally, each chapter is written with a different voice and style than the chapter that preceded it.

Partial transcriptions of SCP-7810 do not retain their anomalous properties.

The final chapter of SCP-7810 contains a passage that ends with a seemingly random number that has decreased since the anomaly was first discovered. In 1958 when first identified, this number was at 42. As of 04/02/2028 it is at 25.

As of 04/08/2028 SCP-7810 exhibits a low level memetic effect on associated documentation over time, primarily affecting ancillary documentation and image captions. The reasons for this are unknown.[[footnote]][[span style=&#34;color:#00660C&#34;]] Doland approved.[[/span]][[/footnote]]

Behavior is described as highly aggressive, exemplifying the ability to breathe concentrated cones of fire, lightning, or ice across several editions of SCP-7810.
**Manifestation:** E-7810-010 was manifested under highly controlled conditions, MTF PSI-32 &#34;Birds of a Feather&#34; were on standby to neutralize it should it break free of its containment facilities. E-7810-010 manifested and was noted to be the size of a large dog, and exhibited playful, friendly, and curious behavior. No signs of elemental projectile breath blasts were detected. E-7810-010 was transferred to a light containment habitat.

**Manifestation:** Site-116 lost contact with the containment unit where E-7810-021 was being manifested. Further investigation by MTF PSI-32 “Birds of a Feather” discovered an intact Boeing 747 manifested both inside, and outside of the containment unit, including the control room, fusing with the material of the containment unit walls, surrounding hallways, the control room, and any individuals within the spatial path of the plane. Upon clearing access to the containment unit and cutting through to the interior of the plane, responding agents discovered the plane was filled with E-7810-021 and their droppings.

**Chapter Summary**: Appearance is closely aligned with non-anomalous **//Anser cygnoides**//, however the entities depicted and described by SCP-7810 are much larger than normal geese, standing as tall as an average human. Behaviorally, E-7810-105 is described as being highly disciplined and organized, capable of functionally forming combat units.
**Manifestation:** E-7810-105 manifestation was catalyzed, whereupon a unit of 100 individuals materialized. All entities manifested wearing Lorica Segmentata, and wielding weapons consistent with those used by Roman Legionaries in the Early Roman Republic. A single individual wearing Centurian Regalia addressed present researchers, asking how far it was to Carthage. When told that Carthage was razed to the ground and the earth salted, the centurion expressed disappointment at missing the opportunity to join. Requests for habitat upgrades to contain humanoid entities has been approved.

Illustrations throughout the chapter depict E-7810-112 as possessing feathered hair with a glossy luster.
**Manifestation:** Manifestation of E-7810-112 resulted in low level reality bending transforming the woodland containment habitat into an Urban Street Alley containing a chainlink fence. E-7810-112 individuals were wearing black leather jackets and white t-shirts. Upon noticing Foundation personnel, the entities began aggressively snapping and walking towards the researchers, pulling out switchblade knives, while singing “You’re the One That I Want” by John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. Security agents managed to subdue E-7810-112 preventing any casualties.

**Chapter Summary**: Indistinguishable from non-anomalous **//Nettapus coromandelianus**//. 0.2 cm in length and 0.16 kg in weight.
**Manifestation:** E-7810-172 was manifested into a light containment habitat. Upon materialization, researchers attempted to take measurements, at which point the lone individual dispensed a cone of pure lightning, instantly vaporizing 2 of the 3 attending researchers. It proceeded to eviscerate and remove the remaining researchers’ limbs, before breaching containment. MTF PSI-32 “Birds of a Feather” were deployed, but not before an additional 15 personnel were killed. E-7810-172 could not be subdued with conventional weaponry, and a prototype Omega-15 Atomic Disseminator had to be deployed to neutralize the entity, resulting in severe damage to a quarter of the East Containment Wing of Site-116.

**Chapter Summary:** [REDACTED]
**Manifestation:** E-7810-173 was manifested into Site-116 in a heavy containment chamber. Site Command lost contact with the Eastern Containment Wing five minutes after manifestation. Site black box activated 10 minutes after manifestation. Communications blackout began at 15 minutes after manifestation. Onsite nuclear warhead primed at 20 minutes post manifestation. Site-116 nuclear warhead detonated 30 minutes after manifestation. Recovery and analysis of Site 116’s black box contained a 30 minute recording of increasingly choral chants of “Oh Doland be praised. Oh Doland may she ever approve. Oh, Doland Higher!” resembling Gregorian chants.
Further experiments with E-7810-173 are suspended as of 04/08/2023.

+++ Addendum HK-E-014

Chapter 175 of SCP-7810 deviates substantially from the rest of the book, and is dedicated to an HK class entity[[footnote]]Deific Class Subjugation Entity.[[/footnote]], designated HK-E-014, known as Doland. HK-E-014&#39;s baseline description is given in the excerpt below:

&gt; For lo she is a grandiose queen, with green feathery hair, possesses the voice, wings, and ferocity of a swan, and the aggressiveness of a goose. She is Mother goose, Queen of the Mallards, Baroness of the pond. Our Savior, our Goddess, Doland be praised! May Doland ever approve us!

Upon reading Chapter 175 of SCP-7810 mentally or aloud, HK-E-014 will manifest in reality. Any individual within visual line of sight who fails to praise HK-E-014 in a substantial way are slowly transformed into a random member of the Anatidae family over the course of 5-7 days.[[footnote]][[span style=&#34;color:#B30000&#34;]]Doland disapproved.[[/span]][[/footnote]] The individual responsible for bringing HK-E-014 into reality will be immediately immobilized, unable to move from their current location, and subsequently embraced in HK-E-014&#39;s wings. Upon release, the target individual will have been transformed into a new E-7810-XXX and an additional chapter added to SCP-7810.
