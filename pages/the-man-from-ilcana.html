**&#34;We have a new assignment for you.&#34;**

&#34;...&#34;

**&#34;A Vampire. It supposedly murdered seven men in southern Dezmond over the past few days.&#34;**

&#34;...&#34;

**&#34;We&#39;ve done an investigation, it lead us to a small church outside of Saint Marianne Cemetery, likely a place where it hides out during daylight.&#34;**

&#34;...&#34;

**&#34;Are you listening?&#34;**

&#34;Mm.&#34;

**&#34;We&#39;re sending you there now. The sun will rise by the time you arrive.&#34;**

&#34;Right...&#34;

----

Vasili stood outside of a little white church near the cemetery. Though he was young, no older than twenty years, his grey-struck hair gleamed dully under the silver sky. He watched the church with wide and shadowed eyes, shifting his weight beneath the cover of his long fur cloak.

Before Vasili could take his next step, a man walked out of the half-open doors. He was lanky, had a head of long, blonde hair that covered his face. He wore a white collared shirt, partially unbuttoned, revealing a bloody gash on his chest.

The man looked up at the dark gray sky before creeping towards Vasili.

&#34;It&#39;s you.&#34; Vasili whispered, still staring into nothingness.

&#34;Hm?&#34; The man tilted his head.

Vasili eyed the blade at the man&#39;s side. Strange for a //soldier// to still carry one after firearms came into public use, but a //vampire// would have no use for bullets. Vasili held the grip of his revolver tighter.

The man pulled his hair back, tying it into a ponytail. His face was scarred, covered in cuts and burns. &#34;You&#39;re a Hunter, aren&#39;t you?&#34; The man laughed. &#34;Are you Fundamentum or-&#34;

Vasili drew his revolver from beneath his cloak. **##white|Bang.##**

In the blink of an eye, the man unsheathed his sword, striking Vasili&#39;s bullet out of the air.

&#34;As expected.&#34; Vasili said.

&#34;Fundamentum.&#34; The man pointed his blade at Vasili. I&#39;ve killed plenty of Fundamentum Hunters in the war. If you&#39;ve fought one you&#39;ve fought them all.&#34;

&#34;Who are you?&#34; Vasili asked.

&#34;Arthur. Arthur Leonhardt.&#34;

Vasili stood and thought for a moment, his gun still pointed at Arthur&#39;s chest.

//&#34;Leonhardt is an Ilcanan name, certainly not an immigrant from the first arcane war, he&#39;s far too young, only looks about forty. He must have been turned recently.&#34;// Vasili eyed the burns on Arthur&#39;s face and the wound on his chest. //&#34;His nails are dull and his wounds have yet to heal. He&#39;s blood-starved.&#34;//

Vasili was so deep in thought that he could barely hear Arthur&#39;s steps.

//&#34;But how could a Vampire who murdered seven people just a few days ago be blood-starved?&#34;// He wondered.

Vasili regains his focus, only to find Arthur is inches away from him. Arthur slashes at Vasili&#39;s neck, narrowly missing as he leaps backwards.

Vasili reaches into his cloak, pulling out a large dagger and rushing towards Arthur. Their blades clash, sending sparks flying into the air. The clinks and clangs of their blades echo throughout the cemetery.

&#34;You&#39;re not like the rest, are you?&#34; Arthur asks.

&#34;What do you mean?&#34; Vasili replies, kicking Arthur back towards the church.

Arthur stumbles back, trying his best to regain his balance. &#34;Your movements are //identical// to how Fundamentum trains its Hunters.&#34;

As Vasili strafes to the left, Arthur extends his leg, tripping Vasili. &#34;You don&#39;t fight like a human, you fight like a fine-tuned machine.&#34;

Vasili falls to the ground. He feels a weight settle across his back and turns his head to see Arthur straddling him. Arthur’s blade kisses the back of his neck, edging toward his short-cropped hair.

“My, even your hair is Fundamentum-mandated. Do you have a single thought of your own in this head of yours?” Arthur leans in closer to Vasili’s ear. “Or do they control //that// as well?”

With a hard twist of his hips Arthur is sent tumbling away as Vasili rights himself. He sees a smirk playing at the edge of the vampire’s lips. “You have no presence, no //self//. You’re nothing but a pawn.” Vasili’s grip tightens on the handle of his sword. “If you were stripped of your name you would be nothing at all, just the idea of a Fundamentum hunter, nothing to distinguish yourself from the doctrine. And when Fundamentum falls? What then? Will you simply find some new master to serve? Some new monolith to prostrate yourself before?&#34;

Those words- the words of a vampire, no less- should not affect Vasili so violently. He shouldn’t feel anything besides determination to eliminate the monster he’s been sent to kill, but something inside him is hooked by Arthur’s frivolous, rambling speech, something raw. //No self,// his mind whispers. He is the platonic ideal of a Fundamentum hunter- he’s always prided himself as such. He’s never let himself consider what his life would have been like from outside the looming power of the Fundamentum; how could he? It is all he knows. It has always been all he knows.

“Struck a nerve, have I?” Arthur crows from across the cemetery, blade still raised in front of him defensively, but he wears a self-assured grin on his face. “It can’t be easy to think about, given you’ve never tried-” Vasili screams forward, single minded in his anger. “Shut up!” he brings his sword down hard against Arthur’s, iron blades snapping on impact. “Shut the FUCK UP!” His chest is heaving, his throat tight. He’s never felt this before, never experienced such a burning fury as this, which seems to eat at his insides and pound at his skull. Vasili throws the remains of his sword to the side and lunges for Arthur. They grapple for a split second, entrenched in wordless struggle before Vasili finds his footing and //pushes//, rearing his fist back a second later and sending Arthur crashing to the ground with a nauseating crunch of bone.

For a moment Vasili stands, breath ragged and knuckles aching, the silence of the graveyard ringing around him. The anger is gone, he realizes- or, no, it is still there, still simmering in his stomach, but the violence has left him.

The quiet air of the churchyard is broken, suddenly. A sputtering breath, first, then wet, wracking coughs- and then Vasili realizes Arthur is //laughing//. His teeth are stained red at the gum lines with blood, his ribs broken and probably piercing his lungs and he is //laughing.//

“//Calm down.//” Vasili thinks.

The laughing continues.

“Calm down.” Vasili whispers.

Arthur&#39;s laugh grows more and more choked, gurgling out of his throat like a drowning man&#39;s bid for air.

“Calm.” Vasili growls.

Vasili desperately tries to regain control of his emotions, to little effect. Arthur hacks, spilling blood onto the stone brick path he laid on. “So the machine does have a soul.”

Vasili approaches Arthur, a vial of blessed water in hand. “You don&#39;t know a //thing// about me.”

Arthur chuckles. “Yet I seem to have offended you. Perhaps you know I&#39;m right.”

Vasili’s grip on the vial tightened as he poured the water over Arthur’s head.

Arthur’s skin didn&#39;t burn, no steam erupted from his blood. Vasili was perplexed, his speed and power was nearly identical to the vampires he had faced in his lifetime, but no vampire could withstand the touch of holy water.

“Secret’s out, huh?” Arthur said as he shook the water off of his face. “The vampire you&#39;re looking for is long gone by now. I just needed to buy him some time.”

“Where is it?” Vasili asked.

“//He//. And I don&#39;t know, he ran when I told him to run.” Arthur said.

“You killed those people… and fed them to that vampire?”

“I made my choice. I wouldn’t let my son starve.”

“...Your son?”

“He&#39;s just a child. Weak, frail. He couldn&#39;t possibly hunt anything on his own and the animals I slaughtered weren&#39;t enough.” Arthur coughed, then fell silent, the last cinders of a challenging glint still burning in his eyes.

Vasili drew his gun from its holster and pressed its muzzle to the man’s forehead. Arthur smiled, teeth red, before Vasili pulled the trigger.

Afterwards, Vasili righted himself and turned to the doors of the chapel, shut tight as they had always been. Somehow, even while his opponent lay dead in the grass, Vasili did not feel as though he had won their battle. Letting out a rattling sigh, he approached the building with quiet steps and tugged one door open quick as a flash- the only sight to greet him inside was that of seven corpses, some strewn across the floor or over pews, most laid in a neat row against the far wall.

No vampire. As Vasili stalked inside he found the prints, tiny feet leaving a trail of blood to a broken window. It really was only a child, then. Some tucked-away piece of Vasili’s heart panged at the thought of a child afflicted with the monstrous condition, how torturous its transformation must have been, but he would show it no mercy all the same.

Vasili strode out of the church with new purpose, his steps ringing hollow across the stone floors.
