**Item #:** SCP-6952

**Object Class:** Thaumiel 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6952 is kept within the armory of MTF Omega-45 (Street Samurai)&#39;s barracks in Site-78. SCP-6952 is to be kept sealed within an Adamantite case when not in use, and may only be removed with authorization from members of Omega-45, or designated researchers who possess Level 5 Clearance or above.

New entries within SCP-6952 must be approved first by the Ethics Committee before construction begins, and instances of SCP-6952-1 shall only be used by members of Omega-45. In the event that a member of Omega-45 falls in combat, any SCP-6952-1 weaponry must be retrieved or scuttled at all costs.

Foundation recovery sites are built around instances of SCP-6952-2 for their retrieval, and any discoveries of SCP-6952-2 by civilians should be promptly recovered and covered up. Witness Amnesctization should be applied as needed.

**Description:** SCP-6952 is a leather-bound book with metal covers. On the spine of SCP-6952 is an engraving that reads &#34;VI of IX&#34;. SCP-6952 is a manual on the creation and development of anomalous weapons and armor, hereby classified as SCP-6952-1 instances. The creation of new instructions on SCP-6952-1 instances is triggered by writing on a blank page of the book, which will prompt the anomaly to start writing schematics, forgery instructions, and usage guidelines. Currently, there are three known limits to the manual. It is unable to create weapons that can damage anomalies with indestructible or immortal properties and other books of the same set such as SCP-6419. Furthermore, queries to build weapons to target the author of SCP-6952 will not be answered.

SCP-6952-2 instances are anomalous materials and devices that facilitate the anomalous properties of SCP-6952-1 weaponry. SCP-6952-2 instances are created along with SCP-6952-1 if the requisite materials do not already exist. Repeated queries to the manual will lead to different SCP-6952-1&#39;s being created. These resources show promise for a variety of uses outside of weapons development, and research is currently ongoing into their applications.

Anecdotally, describing or asking for documents regarding things that aren&#39;t considered weaponry will result in a failed query - the request must be distinctly for something like a sword, gun, bomb, or similar objects.

Instances of SCP-6952-1 that are approved by the Ethics Committee are allowed for usage by MTF Omega-45 to aid in the capture of anomalies and in combat with hostile GoI units. Weaponry provided by SCP-6952 has aided in the capture of over fifty anomalies thus far.


**Discovery:** SCP-6952 was discovered on 5-3-2022 by a unit of Valkyries [[footnote]] All female cyborg combat unit designed for infiltration. [[/footnote]], belonging to the Valravn Corporation. This unit, codenamed &#34;Sverðmeyja[[footnote]] Icelandic for &#34;Sword Maiden&#34; [[/footnote]]&#34;, was deployed to [REDACTED] in Eastern Europe[[footnote]] Valravn withheld this information to protect the privacy of their employers. [[/footnote]]. The Sverðmeyja&#39;s mission was to track down a unit of an anomalous division of PMC Wagner Group [[footnote]] Mercenaries that officially operate under no flag but answer directly to the Russian Government.[[/footnote]]. This division, code named &#34;Volk&#34; were sighted using anomalous and unidentified weaponry. 

The Sverðmeyja were successful in eliminating the mercenaries and retrieved SCP-6952 from their operating base. After returning SCP-6952 back to Valravn, The High Table[[footnote]] Valravn Corporation&#39;s board of directors. [[/footnote]], contacted the O5 Council, offering to trade SCP-6952 for information on [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6755 SCP-6755]. The O5 Council accepted, and SCP-6952 was transferred into Foundation care, as well as video logs taken from the Sverðmeyja&#39;s cybernetics. What is suspected is that Valravn had more relevant information on the Set of Nine[[footnote]] Current Foundation designation for an anomalous set of books marked by roman numerals [[/footnote]], but would not divulge it despite the Foundation&#39;s request.




**Addendum 6952.01:** 


@@@@

The following is a video feed taken from the cybernetic eyes of the Sverðmeyja, S-03 code named &#34;Sigrun&#34;. As per the deal with the Valravn Corporation, only the code names of the operatives were given and nothing else about their backgrounds and capabilities. The Sverðmeyja had located the operating base inside of an abandoned warehouse and began their mission.

**A note from Researcher Johnston:** Well, I must admit I didn&#39;t expect quite so...brutal of an operation from their video log. From reviewing this footage, we&#39;ve been able to learn a lot about the capabilities of the Valkyries. Body-mounted cybernetic weaponry, incredible strength, a mechanical body that is strangely quiet, speed and agility. I still do wonder how much of them is human.

As for the Volk division they&#39;ve been classified as GoI-8947 after this incident. I sent a request to RAISA to look into this Grigori Aleksandrovich. If he&#39;s connected to the Valkyries and Lefty he could be a lead into finding out the source of the Set of Nine.

**Addendum 6952.02:** List of current SCP-6952-1 Instances

[[tabview]]
[[tab Gauss Rifle]]
* **Weapon Type:** Assault Rifle
* **Firing Modes:** Full Auto, 3-Round Burst, Single Fire
* **Effective Range:** Up to 1.5km
* **Projectile Speed:** 1,120 m/s (Mach 3.38)
* **Ammunition:** 8mm Tungsten Anti-Armor Sabot
* **Magazine Size:**50 Round Magazine, 1x Battery rated for up to 800 shots.
* **Author:** Volk Division

**Description:** The Gauss Rifle is a ballistics projection device shaped like a conventional rifle firearm, but uses a coilgun[[footnote]] Coilgun design incorporates electromagnetism in place of conventional gunpowder explosions - the bullets in a coilgun are not actually bullets, but simply solid ferromagnetic objects with aerodynamic shapes. This previously theoretical design would allow for higher speeds with deadlier ammunition, and with a super conductor it needs very little maintenance due to few moving parts. [[/footnote]] design in place of gunpowder propulsion.  Inside the chassis of the gun is a series of coils wrapped around the barrel made from Coronal Ferrite, which is a metal with anomalous heat resistance and superconducting properties. Coronal Ferrite lacks electrical resistance, allowing the coils to be more power efficient and generate enough magnetic pull to accelerate the projectile at supersonic speeds - most critically the gun doesn&#39;t generate heat. A ferromagnetic projectile is provided by the magazine into the barrel, with an anomalous magnetic shield around the magazine&#39;s remaining ammunition to prevent the gun ripping itself apart.

To compensate for the added recoil of the higher speed projectile, kinetic dampeners were installed into the Gauss Rifle&#39;s chassis by combining previous Foundation designs with ones provided by SCP-6952. This results in a ballistics delivery system with less recoil than even many pistols.

The Rifle can be equipped with an underbarrel 38mm laser guided HEAT9[[footnote]] High Explosive Anti-Tank. An explosive charge collapses a metal liner into a hot superplastic jet to cut through armor [[/footnote]] rocket. Several variants have been developed for anti-personnel and anti-armor purposes.



**Researcher&#39;s Notes:** If I am being honest, I&#39;m no gun expert, but the men and women of Omega-45 give it their thumbs up. The sheer force of bullets kinetic energy is highly effective against heavy layers of composite armor like that of tanks and if that isn&#39;t good  enough, you have the missile launcher. In the field, the weapon has been performing admirably. Our boys shred insurgency folks like paper, and the tungsten bullets don&#39;t bounce off of tougher anomalous hides. 

P.S The boys egged me on to try the thing, and oh boy, I never thought blowing up watermelons would be so much fun. - Researcher Johnston


[[/tab]]
[[tab High Velocity Blade]]
* **Weapon Type:** Bladed Weapon
* **Usage:** UV Generator needs to be charged for 48 hours of use
* **Author:** Volk Division

**Description:** Utilizing an Ultrasonic Vibration generator, the affected blade begins to vibrate a rate of 10,000 Hertz. The intense vibration of the atomic structure of the blade,causes the bonds of the target to disintegrate leading to an easier cut. Foundation personnel combine a High Carbon-Adamantine blade with these generators to create weapons that can nearly cut through anything. Every High Velocity blade is fitted with a vibration proof handle, to prevent discomfort or harm to the user.

**Researcher&#39;s Notes:** The High Velocity Blades are quite the interesting development. We haven&#39;t yet come across a singular material that the blades can&#39;t cut through, although there is a limit to how much armor they can get through in a single swing. You can&#39;t cut a tank or a mech in half with this thing. That would be ridiculous. - Researcher Johnston
[[/tab]]

[[tab &#34;Hephaestus&#34;-Grade Body Armor]]
* **Armor Type:** Helmets, bullet resistant plate, etc.
* **Author:** Volk Division, design refined by SCP Armaments Ltd.

**Description:** By using the anomalous properties of Adamantite, a metal with similar properties to graphene, the Foundation was able to create lighter weight bulletproof vests and plates for plate carriers that render a soldier nigh invincible from conventional weapons. The technology can be applied to all types of heavier metal armor and explosion proof suits. In applications where Hephaestus-Grade plate would be too heavy and impair the user, a powered exoskeleton was developed to aid the user in remaining protected and keeping mobility.

**Researcher&#39;s Notes:** No metal is indestructible, and neither is body armor. What we&#39;ve dubbed &#34;Hephaestus&#34; Grade is easily one of the largest leaps in armor technology we have for our MTF. While anomalous means are required to destroy it, we&#39;ve had a bit of fun trying the old conventional ways of trying to dent a Hephaestus plate. One of the boys suggested we try nuking it, and I promptly told him that was completely excessive.- Researcher Johnston

**Addendum 6952.03:** List of current SCP-6952-2 instances

[[tabview]]
[[tab Coronal Ferrite]]
**Atomic Number:** 26
**Symbol:**C-Fe
**Location:** Ural Mountains, Rocky Mountains, Himalayas, TBD
**Melting Point:** 10,000C

Description: Coronal ferrite is an allotrope of iron found in mountainous regions where the atmospheric pressure is the lowest. It appears to act like regular iron under all circumstances, except for its extremely high melting point, almost 0 electrical resistance and superconducting capability.  While this makes it harder to forge, the result is a superconductive metal, allowing for the development of railguns and coilguns. Other potential applications of this material are broad, from space exploration to deep core drilling.
[[/tab]]
[[tab Ultrasonic Vibration Generator]]

**Description:** The Ultrasonic Vibration Generator is a complex rechargeable device that can be fitted in the hilt of a blade that begins vibrating the metal at ultrasonic frequencies. The exact nature of its construction and how it effects work is currently classified. The only requirement for weaponization is that the blade be sturdy enough to not be ripped apart molecularly by the strong energy being applied to its bonds.
[[/tab]]
[[tab Boron Adamantide plating]]
* **Chemical Formula:** B,,4,,A
* **Hardness:** 38 GPa
* **Fracture Toughness:** 6.5 MPa
* **Location of Adamantite Deposits:** Earth&#39;s crust, composition is now 1% Adamantite

Preparation: 2 B,,2,,O,,3,, + 7 A → B,,4,,A+ 6 AO

**Description:** Adamantite is an anomalous metal being hailed by Foundation scientists as a new wonder metal. Compared to Boron Carbide, Boron Adamantide is twice as strong. Adamantine shares the properties of Carbon with the added bonus of being able to be made into steel. Boron Adamantide is a super dense, highly conductive material is great for making metal matrices, cutting tools, and most importantly, body armor. Its increased neutronal absorption capability makes it excellent for the construction of neutron bombs, in the event there is an anomaly that requires such dire measures.

Addendum 6952.04: A notice regarding the involvement of Volk Division with SCP-6952

[[div class=&#34;blokquote-alt&#34;]]

To the faculty of Site 78, given the recent situation in Eastern Europe and the large amount of amateur and professional media coverage due to recent instability it stands to reason that we are at high risk of a Lifted Veil scenario if anomalies are being used by Volk Division. As a result, Foundation webcrawlers are to ensure that any videos or pictures of anomalous phenomena are removed from social media. Due to the delicate geopolitical balance in the region, we must be careful not to interfere with any ongoing military operations unless an anomalous presence is detected. We&#39;re already being questioned about why this event happened without our notice and the last thing we need is losing governmental funding and support in the region.

The Russian Government has officially disavowed any connection to  the Volk Division just like they have nothing to do with the organization as a whole. This thankfully allows our forces to intercept and engage Volk units without having to worry about political responses. All Foundation personnel are to standby in case we are to assist local branches with moving anomalies to more secure locations or to combat the growing anomalous presence in the region.

Site-78, please remain vigilant. These are troubling times. - Site Director Leah Richter

##17e610| It has been a bit since our last correspondence. I apologize that I&#39;ve been so tight-lipped on specifics on SCP-6952. It&#39;s classification as Thaumiel has necessitated level 5 clearance. I&#39;ve been trying to get Director Richter to relent, given that SCP-6952 is part of the ongoing research into the Set. However, she seems adamant that your... eclectic personality isn&#39;t the right fit.##

##17e610|Now In regards with SCP-6952&#39;s connections with the Set... I can say that with [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6419 SCP-6419] formerly in the hands of Chaos Insurgency and the Valravn Corporation apparently having knowledge of SCP-6952 before they retrieved it, I think something might be cooking in the GoI community that we just aren&#39;t aware of yet. We tried looking into the connection with Lefty, but our Russian agents were unable to get anything out of him. The true author of these books evades us still. ##

##17e610| In addition, I received your list of queries and I was given permission to test them. It wouldn&#39;t reveal the identity of or make weapons that could kill its author (I am not suggesting trying to eliminate the author yet, but if we knew what kind of weapons could kill them, we could infer their identity). SCP-6952 would not make weapons that could destroy other books in the Set. It won&#39;t respond to queries it can&#39;t make weapons for. If this thing has sentience, we haven&#39;t found any evidence of it.##

##17e610| I hope that answers some of your questions. I&#39;ll keep you posted on any further developments.##
