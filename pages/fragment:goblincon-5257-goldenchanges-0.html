I miss her sometimes.
It&#39;s so hard not to.
She was beautiful. The most beautiful person I had ever seen.
Everything about her was so perfect.
I thought about her every day. No matter what, no matter where I was. 
She was there, somewhere in the back of my mind.
She was gorgeous.
@@ @@
It was my happiest day, seeing her smile when I told her how much I loved her.
Taking her hand and holding it,
It was the best point of my life, the peak.
The very thing I had always dreamed of. 
I thought it&#39;d never end.

It&#39;s been such a long time since I&#39;ve heard my own voice.
It&#39;s such a beautiful feeling.
So liberating. So freeing. So special. It feels like a blessing.
Maybe I&#39;ve deserved it.
It&#39;s gotten so lonely here, after all.
So empty. So boring. Nothing to do.
Just thinking about what there is out there. How she&#39;s doing.
If I&#39;m truly alone.
@@ @@
It seems so.
@@ @@
I don&#39;t have that much time here.
I wish I could see your face. I wish I could see if you were really there.
You could be an AI. You could be an anomaly. You could be anything.
You can&#39;t respond. You can&#39;t nod, yes or no. You can&#39;t help me.
Can you?
@@ @@
I need to tell somebody, though.
It doesn&#39;t matter if I&#39;m alone.
It doesn&#39;t matter if they&#39;ve given up on me.
Somebody will hear. Somebody has to hear.
And maybe the thought will keep me distracted for a bit longer.
I just hope there&#39;s someone out there who can understand.
Anyone.

The truth is,
