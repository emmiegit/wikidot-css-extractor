**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7570 is currently contained within an abandoned lumber mill, 40 km east of Milam, Texas. No less than four armed guards should be stationed within the nearby Foundation Site-7 at a time to monitor the area and ensure Senior Researcher Regan Morgan is not interrupted during her research on SCP-7570. Anyone caught trespassing on the site should be captured and questioned on their knowledge of the anomaly. A majority of trespassers are lost locals who should be amnesticized and placed back into society according to standard procedure. Members of any GOI should be brought directly to the O5-Council for questioning.

The erasure of SCP-7570-1 is the highest priority of the Foundation. Senior Researcher Regan Morgan has been given a temporary extension on her clearance due to her relationship with SCP-7570-1. Any anomaly she thinks might be beneficial to her research will be provided to her after review of the O5 Council.
------------------
**Description:** SCP-7570 is a machine housed within an abandoned lumber mill near Milam, Texas. SCP-7570 is a temporal displacement device capable of transmitting a constant projection from any point in the past back to the present. The device can simulate the past with no apparent limit; as the furthest point reached by Senior Researcher Regan Morgan was well beyond the creation of our universe.

The Foundation first became aware of SCP-7570 after the minuscule town of Milam, Texas was discovered to be consuming power equivalent to that of Chicago. Foundation Agents investigated the abnormality and discovered the dead body of Francis Connery laying against SCP-7570. Connery was a NASA scientist and known procurer of anomalous technology. The Forensics Department ruled this death a suicide due to the self-inflicted gunshot wound. Forensic investigators stated that the incident happened weeks before SCP-7570&#39;s discovery. The function of the anomaly was soon discovered along with Connery&#39;s journal[[footnote]]See Addendum 1[[/footnote]] which was wholly destroyed excluding its last page. Regan Morgan’s journal [[footnote]]See Addendum 2[[/footnote]] contains all information gathered from the notes Connery destroyed.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
Why did God create the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil? He created the world down to the last atom; he knows everything that has and will happen so why did he create the tree, knowing the serpent would seduce Eve into defiance? Why did he create humanity, knowing of their coming betrayal? Why did he deny Cain’s offering, knowing of the coming fratricide? Why did he give Samson a critical weakness knowing it would be exploited? Why did he make David see Bathsheba bathing on the roof knowing of the blood soon to be spilled? Why did he sow the wind knowing he’d reap the whirlwind?

**ENTRY 1**
--------------
I’m being relocated today. I wasn’t told much but I don’t really think it matters anyway. Our funding has been running low for months and Lonnie told me yesterday we’d likely be thrown to random anomalies soon. Can’t say I was too surprised when I got the email today. In fact, the only emotion I felt was anger. Some random Mekhanite piece of trash in backwater East Texas is apparently much more important than our work here. So important they only sent a Junior Researcher to investigate and conjure up the report.

It’s times like these that I wonder why we do this job. Yes, I know, secure, contain, protect—but what does that mean at this point? The majority of people here consider the Foundation a prison but that’s not true—prison offers a chance at rehabilitation. The Foundation is a tomb, we lock up things and leave them to rot. Endlessly labeling and categorizing inconveniences before throwing them in a tomb and locking them away. Lonnie was going to change that, Lonnie was going to offer rehabilitation for humanoid anomalies, we were going to change the way the Foundation operated forever. Then they cut our funding and stole our researchers in order to continue labeling and organizing inconveniences for them.
---------------
Amelia. I do it for her. After I do this I’ll try to regroup with Lonnie, see if we can salvage the program.

**ENTRY 2**
---------
I’ve learned a bit more about the anomaly I’m assigned to and I can’t say I’m not excited. It’s incredible they’re letting such a low-level operative work on such an anomaly. Though, in all honesty, I don’t think the Site Director really understood the impact this thing could have. Okay, I’m getting ahead of myself, let me try to explain what it is.

As far as the MTF could tell, it was a time machine. A big globe-shaped monstrosity that allows you to observe any time in the past. It doesn’t travel forward, but that doesn’t take away from how incredibly important this thing is. Any mystery that history has forgotten can be completely clarified. Cold murder cases? Solved. Speculating about dinosaurs using only their bones? A thing of the past. The birth of humanity? You can watch it like a movie. I’m shaking thinking of the possibilities. My job is to find out how it works, write a report, and they&#39;ve given me a week to do it. A full week. Fuck that, I&#39;m exploring now,
--------------
I ship out tomorrow; they gave me two MTF agents to be my guard dogs. I don’t know how long I’ll be able to stick around before they realize what this can do but I hope it’s long enough to hit some of my highlight areas, I’m going to write ideas here while I’m traveling: 

-Dinosaurs.

-What happened with the whole “Croatoan” thing.

-The first humans.

-The audience&#39;s reaction to Vader in “Empire Strikes Back” on opening night.

-Give Laika a pat on the head.

I’m sure I’ll come up with more but right now that’s all I have. I’m in Milam now, we’re set up in this cabin a few miles out from the machine. I got my own room and the two MTF guys are sleeping together, I offered to take the couch but they seemed to prefer being together. I tried to strike up a conversation but the guys mostly kept to themselves. That’s fine, I might actually enjoy that more.

**ENTRY 3**
----------
The machine is more complex than I originally anticipated. I’ve been here all day and have only now started to understand how it operates. I’ll do my best to transcribe that here, but in all honesty, it&#39;s equivalent to a mouse explaining how an air fryer works. When I got here I went through the motions of setting up a desk and laptop outside of the globe. With my battle station ready, I looked through the journals and files that the original owner left behind. I was doing my best to understand the tatters of writing and diagrams but it seemed like the notes were useless jargon even before they were ripped apart. There are, however, a bunch of mentions of something called a “wrist-pad”, from what I can tell it’s what controls the machine. I need it in order to operate SCP-7570 properly and until I find the device our time machine is nothing more than a hunk of unhelpful garbage. After an hour of searching with no luck, I approached the MTF guys to see if they knew anything about it. 

When I stepped outside the smell of cigarette smoke hit my breath, the guards appeared to have made themselves at home. They sat on two worn folding chairs facing the yellow forest ahead. As I approached I watched them pass the dart back and forth with stories following close behind. I asked them about the wrist-pad much to their annoyance. Apparently, they knew about something found on the previous owner that could be described as a &#34;wrist-pad&#34; but it was off the nearest site, still attached to the dead guy. Annoyance made a reappearance when I told them I needed the device. I impatiently watched a game of rock, paper, scissors that felt like it had a few too many ties, but eventually the guy named Adam lost. The MTF agent grumbled as he called the guys transporting the body and left to meet up with them for the wrist-pad. After that, the other guy, Joseph, got bored and joined me in the lumber mill.
---------
Joseph took an interest in the machine that I didn’t expect from him. At the moment I was studying the wiring and he started asking questions, a lot of questions. To be honest I couldn’t answer most of them as I didn’t really know what I was looking at myself. I spent my early career working on SCP-217 so I knew the Mekhanite signature. Yet, this didn’t match any tech from the church. The more I looked the less the machine made sense, at times appearing to be a random assortment of parts. Wires seemed to create loops back into themselves while some didn’t seem to connect to anything at all. Whatever was holding this thing together seemed to be thaumaturgical in nature rather than mechanical.

Upon telling Joseph it was a time machine he seemed to latch on to the idea. He began to attack me with questions, asking about things in history we had never figured out. The zodiac killer, JFK, was the moon landing faked, the tank guy from that one video. I couldn’t show him any of these things without the wrist-pad but that didn’t mean I couldn’t turn the machine on. You see, the wrist-pad controlled SCP-7570 but it didn’t activate it. While tinkering that the inner workings I discovered the simulation automatically activates when someone steps inside. The only time it could show was a bit grim but Joseph was insistent we check it out. With nothing more I could really gather from the outside, I relented and led him in.

The interior was a sight to behold. As the two of us stepped inside we stared up at the giant dome looming twenty feet over us, the walls lined with an assortment of lenses and screens. The floor was soft and gave a bit when you stepped on it, not unlike a trampoline. There was little order in the chaos on the walls but that didn’t take away from the grandiose feeling gathered from stepping inside. It carried the same aura as a throne or cathedral. I led Joseph inside and shut the hatch behind us. The machine activated and almost instantly the dome started to fill with green smoke. I wasn’t sure what the smoke was but when it slithered up my body I could smell the distinct aroma of roasted chestnuts. I stepped out into the middle and waited until all I saw was green and then watched the lenses activate.

The green curtains fell away as light started to shine through the clouds. Eventually, we saw shapes slowly form around us until we were no longer in the dome. We were standing outside the lumber mill, birds were singing, and the morning sun was peeking over the horizon. Joseph was in amazement, asking me how it worked.

I explained as best I could, telling him that the lenses simulate the environment onto the smoke around us. The entire machine basically acts as a projector that shows exclusively the past, we aren’t actually taken back through time, only shown it. The reason we were able to walk around was due to the floor acting as a kind of treadmill, when I stepped forward the floor would move back, keeping me in the middle and moving the simulation accordingly.

I watched him reach out and touch a tree only for it to vanish into green smoke, he laughed, obviously in pure awe. I felt a smile creep across my face, the thought crossed my mind that Amelia would like this. Joseph reminded me of her in a lot of ways, there was a spark of light in his eyes that filled me with bittersweet nostalgia. Eventually, I pushed the thought from my mind and stepped forward, leading Joseph into the lumber mill.

“Where are we?” he asked.

“The right question is-”

“Don’t finish that joke!” Joseph said, “I’ve heard it in every time travel movie for the past decade.”

There was a pause for a moment before I quickly blurted out, “When are we!”

“Motherfucker.”

“But to answer your question we’re a few weeks before our current time, it’s the last time the machine was powered on with a wrist-pad inside of it.”

Just as I finished speaking a man burst from the machine, he was older and looked to be covered in a thin layer of grime. He seemed frantic, like a feral animal, stumbling and breathing heavily. This was Francis Connery, another aspect of the mission that Joseph was uninformed on, referring to him only as ‘dead guy’. I found it strange that MTF agents weren’t told so much about the missions they were assigned to. It seemed the Foundation&#39;s lack of resources in the previous months had affected more than just us researchers.

I explained Connery to him using the information that came with my files. He was a NASA scientist and very skilled at his job. So skilled, in fact, that he learned about the anomalous world and evaded amnesticization. It took the Foundation one week to decide he wasn’t worth the resources and gave up on the search. Joseph found this tale unbelievable as he considered the Foundation pretty ironclad in its operations. This isn&#39;t an uncommon belief, but the truth is that this happened a lot more than most people probably think. Sometimes we can’t find the person or the situation is so crazy that witnesses sound insane to any normal individual. Most of the GOIs consist of these civilians who ran from the Foundation and had nowhere else to turn. Connery was one such person who took a keen interest in anomalous tech he could purchase from MC&amp;D.

Joseph listened to my lengthy explanation with bated breath while Connery took his time shredding and burning years of research around us. I found Joseph’s fascination endearing, his curiosity and eagerness to learn would have made him a brilliant researcher in another time. It also led him to his next question.

“What made him go all crazy and shit?”

“No idea, whatever he saw he didn’t write about.” I answered, “Or maybe he did and just shredded it. The only thing I’ve found that’s legible is the short paragraph he’s about to start writing right… now.” I said as Connery picked up the book and wrote wildly.

Joseph stood at his side, watching him write and reading it aloud, when Connery finished Joseph asked, “What does that mean?”

“I don’t know.” I lied. “Seems to me he just went crazy.”

“Really? You don’t have any idea, theory, or anything like that?” he said, calling my bluff.

“Well, there is one theory.” I said, “He was a very religious man from what I’ve been told. First one in the pew every Sunday type. From how he’s writing, it sounds like Francis is listing inconsistencies he’s noticed but never acknowledged till now. My guess is that he found something that didn’t align with his religion. It was too much for him and he…” we both fell silent as Connery retrieved his gun and killed himself with no hesitation.

“Damn,” Joseph said, “That’s depressing.”

“Are you religious?” I asked, unsure I could provide any comfort if he said yes.

“No.” he thankfully replied, “I don’t think there’s many in our line of work that can be. I’ve seen things happen to men that the cruelest gods wouldn’t allow. But I was, and I think it still has a hold on me in ways I don’t realize. When I think of things like the past and future I picture scripture without even thinking about it. I guess I’m like him in a lot of ways, you commit so much of your life to something that it’s hard to let go.”

Joseph seemed deep in thought and I experienced the all too familiar feeling of not knowing what to say when someone spills their heart out to you. Eventually, I went with the old classic, “It be like that.”

We eventually left with the bitterness of the situation still residing inside of us. As we stepped outside Joseph offered me a cigarette to help with the grimness. I took it and talked with Joseph until Adam returned. I probably shouldn’t be writing all this non-vital information here but it’s kinda therapeutic. Might make this my personal journal and have another strictly for work. We’ll see how it goes.
-------------
With the wrist-pad, traveling through time is now possible but I still haven’t been able to do so. The device itself is a tablet attached to a brace meant to clamp around the user’s forearm. I wasn’t delighted to see the numerous needles lining the inside of the brace, likely meant to create some neural connection. I really don’t get paid enough for this but I bit down on a piece of wood I found and latched the device into my forearm. The pain is really impossible to describe so I won’t try to. Just know Joseph found be passed out on my desk because of it.

With that done I attempted to operate the machine and there’s a few changes I’ve noticed since I acquired the wrist-pad. The first being that the simulation seems much more vivid than before. On my previous explorations the world looked clear enough but there were complications. Some places looked more blurry than others, not unlike my eyesight without glasses. Since I’ve acquired the wrist-pad that issue is completely resolved and I’ve discovered that I no longer require glasses within the dome at all. This is likely the neural connection filling in the blanks that the smoke and lenses couldn’t. I’ve also discovered that I can’t as easily phase through objects conjured within the simulation. Now, when I touch a tree I feel resistance and the texture of the bark; yet with enough effort, I can still push through.

As for the tablet itself I’ve found several functions but none that allow me to “rewind” or “fast forward”. The hud is fairly bare housing only a bar meant for typing coordinates and 10 cells which I believe are meant to be “bookmarks”. The bookmarks saved do seem to work but don’t take me anywhere I know. They just seem to be black voids, possibly a glitch?
-------------
I managed to accidentally rewind; I don’t know how I did it but the simulation is now traveling in reverse. I didn’t even click anything on the tablet, I simply reached for my lab coat and noticed it was now moving backwards. Once this happened, a dial appeared on the wrist-pad, displaying the time, date, year, and either BC or AD depending on the era you’re in. I don’t know how to stop it or make it go faster so I’m just typing in coordinates, usually large cities, to explore the daily lives of people from a different point of view .
-------------
It’s weird, walking the streets of New York as a ghost. People march through me as if I’m not there, which now that I think of it, is actually pretty normal. The only real difference is that I can follow strangers and get a small glimpse of their lives without them knowing. At first, it felt like an invasion of privacy and in a lot of ways it still does, but it’s something that has bothered me less and less the more I’ve explored. Nothing really crazy happened apart from that time I saw a robbery in reverse making it look like a nice man was handing a store clerk handfuls of money.
--------------
The guys said it’s getting dark so we should probably hit the road. The way these two talk about deer makes me think they’ll be actively attacking our vehicle. There&#39;s still so much I want to explore but, as they say, there’s always tomorrow.

**ENTRY 4**
-----------
I think I figured out the controls for the machine. While going through the piles of shredded paper, an activity I’m starting to get used to, I found a tattered remnant that mentioned ASL. Another look at my notes told me that Connery was fluent in ASL due to the fact his child was born deaf. I think when I reached into my coat yesterday I accidentally made the sign for “rewind”. I&#39;ll test my theory first thing in the morning. Oh, I also wrote up the file for SCP-7570. It was surprisingly easy, not sure why they gave me a week to do it.
-------------
I&#39;m back at the lumber mill now, ASL dictionary in hand and ready to go. So far I&#39;ve figured out the controls for forward, backward, and pause. These were easy enough since they were essentially direct translations. Unfortunately, I have hit a roadblock trying to find the bookmark command. I&#39;ve searched for about an hour yet haven&#39;t found a suitable translation at the moment, but it’s something I can toy with later. Other than that, I discovered I can speed up the simulation’s rewind by simply making the sign again. With all these commands in my toolbelt, I can finally start my vacation in time.
--------------
Took half the day before I could rewind to the dinosaurs. It&#39;s hard to realize how much history there actually is until you&#39;re watching the years regress before your eyes. The experience of watching the world change over centuries is hard to describe. The speed I had the simulation rewinding was condensing decades into seconds rendering any details apart from city construction and destruction impossible to comprehend. After about four hours I actually made it to the Cretaceous Period at 100,000,000 BC. If I could talk to Connery I’d tell him to change the BC and AD labels to one that showed the period instead. I saw the dial hit 100,000,000 BC and stopped it, hoping to see fields of dinosaurs but meeting a much more familiar sight instead. I was in New York and it looked completely normal. Needless to say, I was extremely confused and checked the dial nearly a thousand times in an attempt to find an explanation. When that didn&#39;t work I set about wandering the streets again. It looked extremely similar to the New York I remember living my early life in. The fashion and tech people used were foreign to me but other than that I found myself feeling at home, something strangely disturbing 100,000,000 years ago.

I started moving forward again but at a much slower pace. I was watching, waiting patiently to find any explanation and it wasn&#39;t long before the calamity reared its head. I was staring at the city skyline for a second and in the next moment it was gone, a barren field having taken its place. Stopping and rewinding revealed something biblical, a cloud flew over New York millennia ago and descended upon the mega-city, eating everything within a day. Locus. Locus that ate through metal, stone, and men all the same came and erased New York from existence. That is before I traveled forward and saw it rebuilt exactly the same a few million years later. Eventually, I found out what I was witnessing. You hear a lot of rumors and ghost stories when you work at the Foundation, one of which was the story of a machine in the heart of a national park capable of resurrecting the world. Apparently, this was more than a legend and it had been used before, possibly more than once. This event would make navigation of time a little more difficult than I realized. Depending on how many apocalypses earth had seen I’d have to adjust my dates by possible eons. After contemplation, I decided I’d start with dates closer to the present and move back from there. This would limit my complications till I hit the first end-of-the-world scenario. Before I left I did find out how to bookmark by signing the word “save”. I placed a bookmark on locus day and continued my exploration.
------------
The CROATOAN thing was actually a lot more interesting than anticipated. I was expecting it to be the settlers pissing off the natives but it was a lot more complicated than that. The settlers were minding their own business one day when one of them decided to cut down the wrong tree. The moment the ax hit the bark the pine started to bleed and shake violently, I watched as the tree fell away into dust and revealed a large black pentagon floating in the air. It started singing in a language I didn’t understand and when it flew close to the settlers they turned to poppy seeds. Eventually, the entire town was gone and the natives came. The spiritual leaders cornered the shape in a circle with various spices before conducting a ritual. The anomaly thrashed but in the end, the natives won, trapping it within another tree that they then marked with the phrase CROATOAN. Interesting to say the least.

**ENTRY 5**
----------------
First humans is a hard one. After returning to my bookmark on locus day, I continued back, trying to pay attention as the world shifted around me. In my effort to find the birth of humanity, I instead found two more apocalypses. One involved monsters killing millions and a massive rift opening up before the Foundation flooded it. The other was a simple asteroid that leveled the earth. There&#39;s a weird simplicity to a big rock hitting our planet that makes me wonder how many times we&#39;ve died out. Each of these events are massive catastrophes, killing billions of people each time. That&#39;s an impossible number to comprehend, but the number becomes even more unfathomable when you realize how many times these events have happened.
---------------
I fell asleep rewinding. I guess I should have listened to Joseph when he told me to head back to the cabin. I denied the offer as something in me felt as if I wouldn&#39;t be able to sleep without finding my goal. Obviously, I was wrong as I passed out watching another apocalypse. When I woke up, the earth was gone and I was floating in space, watching as stars spun around me, slowly moving toward each other. I think I went past the creation of earth. I’m interested where this will lead me so I&#39;ll head back as far as I can.
-----------------
I had to sign rewind for what felt like an eternity until I finally saw the universe moving at an acceptable speed. The numbers on the wrist-pad no longer fit on the screen but I’m not paying much attention to that because the most incredible display of light and energy dances around me. As I rewind more matter comes into view and I watch as everything in our reality crashes and collides into the cosmos. Brilliant shades of unimaginable colors spread across the stars. It’ll happen soon. The beginning.
------------------
Eventually, I made it. I watched everything that is, compress down into nothing and then it was dark. I stopped the simulation, hoping to watch the big bang in real time but in that moment I noticed something. This darkness was familiar to me, a blank emptiness like nothing my experience on earth could compare to. The bookmarks Connery left on the cells, it was here, in the void before time. I stared around me in realization before the bang happened and I saw everything spawn from nothing, endless amounts of matter flowing past me and spiraling into the void. It was beautiful. I tried to rewind to watch it again when I made the discovery.

The universe compressed down. There was the void. Then I was on earth.

I nearly jumped at the sudden familiarity. I was in a city, people and cars sped past me, moving like the endless amount of traffic I knew from New York. I stared at the people, all of them wearing and operating clothing and tech that barely resemble anything on earth. I stopped the simulation and made it run in real time, searching for an explanation. People walked around me, minding their own business, living their lives. Then, without warning, the void. I rewound again, I think a part of me was hoping I was seeing things, imagining the situation but I was met with the same sight. A city, an earth, and a universe predating our own. I checked the dial to ensure I hadn&#39;t accidentally clicked a bookmark and found numbers filling the screen. Finally, I accepted what I was seeing and started to understand what that meant. They were erased, turned to nothing before the universe. We exploded from a point and replaced them. I spent a few hours searching for a cause but there seemed to be nothing, like a random button was pressed and everything was reset.

After a moment I started to think about what that meant for myself. I had made a discovery, a massive discovery that brought seemingly infinite intrigue and dread. On one hand, I&#39;ve found time beyond time. I was talking in my last entry about how much history there is in //our// universe but now with this, that amount of knowledge and experience is practically doubled. An unfathomable amount of time, events, life, and death was hit with a multiplier by this discovery. It&#39;s enough to make us feel smaller than we already were but the dread doesn&#39;t stop there. Something killed them, without warning and without mercy. Billions lived on that planet and countless more potential people beyond the stars and they were all vanquished in the blink of an eye. That&#39;s bad enough but the Foundation has seen its share of universe destroyers. What worries me is the ease at which it not only destroyed everything but destroyed it so completely that nothing remained after. I don&#39;t mean just matter either, concepts such as time, gravity, and reality seem to cease entirely making a void so empty that it doesn&#39;t even look black. It&#39;s hard to describe but when I look out there I don&#39;t see darkness, I just don&#39;t see. There&#39;s nothing. Infinite nothing. I can&#39;t help but wonder if, with our universe&#39;s similarities, can something like that happen again?

I need to document this thoroughly and look at it from every angle.

**ENTRY 6**
------------
I found a Foundation that is equivalent to ours, though not as secretive. Well, they still are but it&#39;s a completely new landscape with the general public knowing about the Foundation and its anomalies. It&#39;s definitely a lot different here as a few of the doctors, some of which I actually recognize, act as celebrities and sometimes even go on talk shows. It’s interesting but not why I’m writing this. I followed a doctor to a Foundation site and explored. It seemed a lot of them knew that the erasure was coming and were attempting to find a way to pass over into the next universe. They made a machine I couldn’t even begin to comprehend and activated it. Not everyone got in before everything collapsed, only a handful of doctors. I wonder what happened to them.
-------------
I followed a random doctor before the erasure of reality. I was curious and wanted to see what people were doing before the collapse, see if that gave me any kind of insight. This girl was ordering coffee at an on-site shop and used her last moments to sit alone near a window overlooking a courtyard. She sipped her drink and stared out at the empty garden. The bags under her eyes told me she had pulled a few all-nighters and the coffee with extra espresso likely meant she’d be pulling more. I joined her at the table, studying the features of her face as she looked out the window. Her hair was a brilliant shade of red and hung down to her shoulders. It was tangled and nappy as she likely didn’t have time to brush it in between appointments. Even so, I felt something for her. Perhaps I saw myself behind the tired, ember eyes. I stared into those eyes until the void swallowed them.

I rewound again, watching her take a sip of her coffee and vanish. I had felt dread before this, but now this small-scale scenario put an ache inside me. The girl had a life, friends, and family. She likely had plans after this coffee and was thinking about them at that very moment. There were sparks of life in her eyes that reflected the sun, a will inside of her that drove her to follow her ambitions. Yet the void didn&#39;t care. As I watched her eyes be swallowed by the nothing I felt everything follow behind. History, dreams, ambitions, the future, the past, every person, every land, everything that ever was and ever had the chance to be was gone. Revealing only the fact that nothing mattered. Every war these people fought and every advance they made seemed completely pointless knowing that they were essentially placing a walkway toward the mouth of non-creation. What was the point?
----------------
If it can happen to them, it can happen to us. I haven’t slept and I feel like everything around me could stop at any moment. I can&#39;t bare this burden on my own. I need to tell someone about what I&#39;ve found. About everything I&#39;ve found.

**Addendum 3: O5 Audio Log #7570-01**

[[div class=&#34;smallmodal&#34;]]
**SCP-7570 Conference 01:**

-----

[BEGIN LOG]

**O5-10**: Okay, is that it? I was working on something before this that I’d like to get back to.

**O5-1**: Yeah I think that’s pretty much… Nope, wait we got one more scheduled today regarding SCP-7570.

**O5-7**: Can it wait till tomorrow, I’m actually kinda busy too.

**O5-1**: Um, let me read the description the site director sent me… //(CLICK TONGUE AND WHISTLES AS HE SCANS THE DOCUMENT)//… Okay, it says we’re meant to have a conference with Junior Researcher Reg-

**O5-8**: Junior Researcher?

**O5-1**: Eight, can you please hold off ’til I’m done, please? Thank You. Where was I? Uhhh, Junior Researcher Regan Morgan regarding something she discovered concerning SCP-7570. Site director says it’s a matter of utmost importance.

**O5-9**: Guess that means we have to do it.

**O5-8**: Can we go back a bit? Junior Researcher? Why is this coming to us? Are we taking every request that comes to our door now? What even is 7570?

**O5-3**: Item Number: SCP-7570. Object Class: Safe-

//(O5-3 CONTINUES RECITING THE DOCUMENT AS THE OTHERS DISCUSS.)//

**O5-8**: Welp, I heard safe. Sounds like it’ll be able to wait till tomorrow.

**O5-9**: She’s apparently already on the line, she’s just waiting for us to accept the call.

**O5-8**: And? She can stay there till tomorrow.

**O5-3**: //(FINISHES READING THE DOCUMENT)// I think we should talk to her.

**O5-8**: Jesus Christ.

**O5-1**: Guys, come on, it’s been a long day for all of us but can we not bicker, for once, please? Okay, Three, why do you think we should hear her out?

**O5-3**: As the document said, SCP-7570 is a machine able to create simulations of the past. Not only is it worrying that the researcher assigned to said machine is trying to contact us, I find it strange that such a low-level operative was assigned to this task at all.

**O5-1**: Worrying how?

**O5-3**: As a junior researcher, most of the info we have is withheld from her. But if she’s been using SCP-7570, she could’ve discovered lots of sensitive material.

**O5-10**: Jesus Christ, who the fuck assigned her to this?

**O5-11**: We’ve been understaffed for months now, something like this was bound to happen. What matters now is that we nip it in the bud, get her amnestisized and reassigned.

**O5-3**: What about hearing her out?

**O5-11**: No point, she’s likely going to bring up one of our many end-of-the-world scenarios and we just went over those an hour ago. You guys wanna talk about them again? You wanna go over the petal people first or the time the sun broke?

**O5-1**: And if it’s something else? Look, guys. I know we’re tired but let’s just get this over with. If it’s like you say Eleven, it’ll be a ten-second conversation.

//(JUNIOR RESEARCHER REGAN MORGAN IS ADDED TO THE CONFERENCE CALL.)//

**O5-1**: Hello, Miss Morgan?

**Morgan**: Hello? Yes? Sorry, I was waiting a while. I hope I&#39;m not interrupting anything.

**O5-1**: It&#39;s not a problem Miss Morgan, now it says here you were referred to us by your site director regarding something you discovered within SCP-7570, is that correct?

**Morgan**: Yes sir, that is correct, I’ve found something troubling in our past that I’m afraid this council is not aware of.

**O5-1**: And what might that be, Miss Morgan?

**Morgan**: Well… this requires some background. While writing the report for SCP-7570, I was experimenting with its functionality and accidentally went back to the beginning of time when-

**O5-10**: Hold on, the beginning of time? I was reading the report, I didn’t realize this machine would see dates past the creation of earth.

**Morgan**: Yes, it’s a common underestimation that my site director also fell for. The truth is that there seems to be no limit to the amount of time the machine can accurately simulate. And because of this, I found something.

**O5-1**: What?

**Morgan**: Seven minutes before the big bang took place I found another universe. One with a very similar world containing humans and even an SCP Foundation.

**O5-1**: A universe predating our own?

**Morgan**: Yes, but the thing that brings me here to you isn’t that the universe was there, it’s that it isn’t there anymore. Something, I&#39;m not sure what, a reality eater, anomaly, universal law, or whatever but something erased their universe and replaced it with our own seven minutes after.

//SILENCE HANGS IN THE ROOM FOR 30 SECONDS//

**Morgan**: Hello?

**O5-10**: You’re certain of this, I mean how much of this universe could you see?

**Morgan**: I spent a day exploring the streets and living their lives. I am positive that this place not only existed but that it was frighteningly similar to our own. They were shaped like us, talked like us, thought like us, I saw Doctor Clef on a talk show! This place was real and something killed it without warning.

**O5-10**: Research for this could be game-changing. If it was an advanced civilization like she says we could find solutions to problems they managed to crack but we haven’t. We need researchers on this, good researchers. I will personally-

**Morgan**: Wait. I had more to say.

**O5-7**: Do not interrupt her.

**O5-10**: No, Seven, it’s fine. What else was there, Miss Morgan?

**Morgan**: It wasn’t the only one.

**O5-10**: I beg your pardon?

**Morgan**: That world, that universe. It wasn’t the only one that was replaced. I kept going back and I found more and more and more.

**O5-1**: How many?

**Morgan**: I don’t know, I haven’t reached the end, there could be hundreds more-

**O5-7**: Hundreds more? How many have you encountered so far?

**Morgan**: Not counting our own, I have counted 786 unique universes destroyed and replaced.

[END LOG]

[[/div]]

Following the conference O5-1 and O5-10 were transported to SCP-7570 where Regan Morgan demonstrated the machine. O5-1 declared that discovering the nature of the universe erasure, now referred to as SCP-7570-1, was the highest priority of the Foundation.

**Addendum 4: SCP-7570-1 Investigation**


LIST OF NOTABLE ERASURE EVENTS
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Former Universe-0027 “Omelas”**: FU-0027 appears to be a universe housing mostly dead worlds apart from two. A similar earth and a distant, powerful, macro-civilization. The earth planet is fairly mundane but research into the alien world revealed an impossibly advanced civilization. Much of their technology seemed to be derived from a thaumaturgical source they harvested with a strange ritual. A select amount of the population was exiled to the planet&#39;s neighboring moons which acted as a malignant probability sink. 

**ERASURE EVENT**: FU-0027 was aware of SCP-7570-1 and were actively attempting to stop it via conceptual attacks they targeted at the idea of circles. All efforts failed, however, as two years after their retaliation, their EE took place.
[[/div]]
-----------------------------------------
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Former Universe-0048 “Radiant Dreams”**: FU-0048 was a space-faring empire that used highly advanced thaumaturgy to cross great distances in very short amounts of time. While completely passive, the empire was not looked upon kindly by other worlds as induction into their ranks often meant the destruction of native cultures and religions in favor of those held by the empire. This inevitably led to their destruction as a race of insect-like humanoids turned their backs on a very real deity that retaliated by infecting the dreams of all who knew its name.

**ERASURE EVENT**: FU-0048 was completely under the control of the dream god at this point and formed a hive mind spanning countless worlds. They made no attempt to fight back when their EE came.
[[/div]]
-----------------------------------------
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Former Universe-0292 “Death’s Death”**: FU-0292 was a civilization extremely similar to our own, even housing a Foundation equivalent. Nearing the century before their EE, a Foundation Operative managed to kill the avatar of death, rendering every living thing in reality unable to die. Society collapsed due to overpopulation and anomalies eventually broke from their cells, one of which, SCP-610, managed to infect every cell of biological matter on the planet. Earth became a giant macro-organism capable of navigating space and invading other planets. Eventually, everything in the universe was absorbed and created cobwebs of flesh spanning across planets and stars throughout the universe.

**ERASURE EVENT**: FU-0292 was in a dormant state until twenty-four hours before their EE. At that moment the flesh-spanning worlds stirred and sank into itself forming a giant deity that used its reality-warping capabilities to reach out of the universe. The entity appeared to be pleading for its life before the EE occurred.
[[/div]]
-----------------------------------------
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Former Universe-SNOW “SNOW”**: Before there was snow the world suffered through infinite impurities, anomalies, and filth. After the introduction of snow there was only snow and only ever was snow. Infinite suffering turned to snow, cultures turned to snow, words-s cre-sn-ate-ow-ed to spr-snow. Snow. snowsnowsnowsnow.

FU-SNOW is a self-sustaining conceptual purifier attached to the idea of snow. This anomaly has the ability to alter any information that discusses it leaving this report open to unavoidable alterations. Navigation of FU-SNOW proved to be unique as times and events seemed to change the moment an infected date was observed, that date being when SCP-3799 was created. Very quickly the simulation of the universe became only snow.

**ERASURE EVENT**: We were left in our purity for seven minutes before we realized our foolishness. We haven&#39;t succeeded, despite sprinkling our purity across every world and every idea there was One who exceeded our reach. We couldn’t see It, only feel the conceptual magnitude of Its existence. We heard a yawn and stopped being snow.
[[/div]]
-----------------------------------------
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Former Universe-2786 “Utopia”**: Unlike other worlds, FU-2786 experienced an EE extremely early in its lifetime and has so far been the only monitored universe that didn&#39;t experience an industrial revolution. In this universe humanity never split away from each other creating a single nation that expanded across Africa, no other continents seemed to contain any human life.

**ERASURE EVENT**: FU-2786 seemed completely unaware before the EE took place.

**Addendum 5: SCP-7570-1 Discovery and Classification**

[[collapsible show=&#34;ACCESS FILE: Entry 7&#34; hide=&#34;CLOSE FILE&#34;]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**ENTRY 7**
--------------
I haven’t updated this in a while and in all honesty, there’s not been much to report. Just more of the same. I’m honestly surprised I’m still on the project at all. They tried phasing me out at first but I work the machine better than anyone else. The last researcher they tried to give the wrist-pad to accidentally erased the bookmarks. We wasted a good two weeks of work having to rewind back to where we were before. They haven’t let anyone else touch the wrist-pad after that. I prefer it that way, I feel like I think better when I work alone.

I’m not really here to write about work. It’s just more dead universes, I stopped describing them at the 1,000 mark, and stopped counting at somewhere around 80,000. I don&#39;t mean to downplay the scale of this, in all honesty, this event is impossible to fully comprehend. To describe the sheer magnitude of destruction, imagine this. If you took every atom that makes up earth and turned them into their own universe you wouldn&#39;t equate to 1% of the universes we&#39;ve recorded. The speed that the simulation is rewinding condenses around one hundred Erasure Events in a single second and we&#39;ve had it on for months. The amount of destruction is incalculable. Yet I feel nothing at this point. All I do is sit in the simulation and watch the universes fly by around me. None of them too different, none of them too similar. I thought I’d find a pattern or something that showed what happened right before it all went dark. Something each of them did that activated the erasure but there’s nothing. In a lot of worlds, everyone is dead so they can’t even activate anything.

But like I said, that’s not why I’m here.

I had a dream about Amelia last night. I haven’t thought of her in a while and decided to take a second to remember her face. After bookmarking where I was I went back to my universe and watched our last meeting. I forgot how small she was, I remembered us being the same height but despite being twins we looked pretty much nothing alike. She was in a Foundation cell and I was visiting. I remember this conversation exactly as I dream about it almost every month. We talk about my work and what I do because we can’t do the opposite. She’s an anomaly, her days consist of sitting in her cell, watching TV, and occasionally reading a book. She didn’t mind much though because I always had great stories about what crazy thing I was working on. There was so much wonder in her eye, so much joy in her laughter, so much life in her. After we talked I told her we’d both be moved as this Site was being abandoned due to residual Hume corruption from a dimensional anomaly. The last thing I said to her was, “See you soon.”

Someone lost a folder, forgot to send a memo, or just couldn’t be bothered to care and because of that one anomaly was left at Site-7. One. It could have been an inanimate object or a vicious monster or even another poor soul but no. It was Amelia. It was almost a month later, after the stress of my move, that I realized I&#39;d never heard where she was taken. They found her right where they locked her up, laying in her bed.

And from my spot in the eternity observatory, I sat there, watching the whole thing. I watched her try to lick the condensation off the walls and eat the roaches on the floor, praying every night that someone would find her. I saw her share her dreams every night even though she knew there was no one nearby for miles.

It’s weird that one death affects me more than the infinite sea of corpses I’ve witnessed solely because I knew her my whole life. Whatever I find there, at the end of time, I’ll ask how it felt. Creating the matter that makes every person, watching every life play out only to erase them all the same.
--------------
I pressed my bookmark and was once again met with the black void, I signed rewind and heard something completely foreign to me. It reminded me of a buzzer when a contestant got a question wrong on a game show. It was loud, annoying, and emanating from my wrist-pad. I looked down at the screen and saw the text displayed.

MAXIMUM LENGTH REACHED

I looked up again, now realizing where I was. The beginning of it all, the first void, the start of the countless deaths that would follow for countless eternities. I stared into the void, watching in real-time as within the blackness there was a spark of light.

Suddenly I felt different, something had changed. There was a void with a single spark in the distance but now it felt foreign. It took me a few seconds to realize I could no longer smell roasted chestnut.

“Step forward.”

I looked up, my attention drawn to the disembodied voice that boomed and whispered into my ear with a billion voices. I watched silently, waiting for something to happen.

“Step forward. Regan Morgan.”

My blood ran cold, I felt a gasp escape my mouth as I stumbled backward, staring at the spark in complete shock. It could see me! I was in a time trillions upon trillions of generations before my universe was even conceived. Why did this thing say my name at the beginning of time?

I choked out an answer, “You can see me?”

“I can. Step forward.”

“I-”

“Step,” I felt myself stiffen as if every atom in my body froze and awaited their commands, “Forward.”

I did as It said, walking to meet It in the darkness, a golden spark that flickered with being and existence. Within the light I saw the billions of universes before mine, all dead and all remembered. This wasn’t the simulation, I was somewhere else, It had taken me here. Where was here, It’s home, another dimension, did It erase my world? Was I in the void awaiting to be replaced?

“Well?” The spark asked impatiently.

I stood there, unsure how to respond, eventually, I found my voice, “Well, what?”

It laughed at me, “Regan, how many times has someone knocked on your door, and when you opened it, they asked you what you wanted?”

“What?” I asked.

“You came looking for me.” It replied, “You watched the entire history of our reality to the beginning, just to meet me. You’ve come all this way, you must have a question in mind. I hope I&#39;m not sounding hostile to you, that&#39;s the last thing I want, Regan Morgan. Because despite your clear inferiority I&#39;ve grown quite attached to you. No one has done what you accomplished, for you, I&#39;ll answer anything. Ask to your heart&#39;s content.”

I watched it for a moment, thinking carefully of what to say, eventually settling with, “What are you?”

“I’m SCP-7570-1. Is that not the name you assigned me?” It asked in a mocking tone, “Or would you prefer ‘reality eater, anomaly, universal law’? You’ve given me many names and I’ve received many more from many others. But my favorite has been I AM. It’s poetic as I am the first thing to ever be. Therefore I AM.”

“Okay,” I said, “I AM… why-”

“You’re not the first.” I AM said, interrupting me, “To find Me, I mean. There was another before you. An older man, I was as surprised then as I am now. I mention Francis Connery because he asked the same question you are about to ask. Why did I create, erase, and replace billions of worlds billions of times.” I stood silent, getting the feeling It would talk without my input, “You know what happened to him, are you sure you want to know?”

I took a deep breath, “Yes.”

“Good.” I AM said, a smile audible in Its voice, “I never get the chance to talk, to you, it’s normal, to Me it’s a delicacy. Your question requires a story. At the beginning of what is, I realized I was. This separated Me from what you see around you, the void of voids. I spent My time crafting My will into existence. Void is a substance without form, a willess anti-creation, all realities and stories are created with the emptiness. With void, I created My first world. It was beautiful, I made creatures, thinking things that could operate and struggle all their own. I sat above them at the pinnacle of our reality and watched as they lived, crafted, explored, birthed, died, repopulated, expanded, conquered, consumed, and experienced all on their own. I felt such love for them. Even for something like Me the feeling, the rush, it&#39;s impossible to put into words. I only knew the void but suddenly I could watch their war, their love, the beauty of life and death and rebirth.”

Its voice shook as It explained, if I didn&#39;t know what this entity was I would have believed It actually loved Its creation. There was a wonder in Its voice I have never heard in another living being before or since, it was manic. If this thing had a face It would likely weep tears of joy explaining this to me. Even so, I knew it couldn&#39;t be real.

“Then why erase them?” I asked.

“Erase?” It laughed at me, “No, do you have any idea how hard it is to create consciousness, it took Me billions of eons to craft the unique minds of those people. I couldn’t just throw them away when they expired. No, repurposed is the right word, you plunge a consciousness in a void for a few eons and they forget everything they were. Leaving only empty minds to place within the next group, good as new.”

“Convenience?” I asked I AM, a hint of hatred in my voice I felt It notice, “You destroyed and replaced those worlds out of convenience?”

“No.” It answered, “I did it out of boredom.”

The answer hung in the air for a moment, the weight of what I AM was saying finally starting to reach me.

“You get it,” the entity said, “You’re understanding what I&#39;m telling you. You see all of these worlds start out so engaging, so entertaining, but eventually, every tale hits its climax. Be honest with yourself, Regan, how many books have you read past their resolution? How many movies out there show what happens after they all lived happily ever after? How many people complain in your universe alone about how //The Walking Dead// or //The Simpsons// have gone on for way too long? You might not want to admit it but you know, Regan, on some level, somewhere in your mind you understand. That&#39;s half the reason that I love you so much because you can understand this, it killed Connery but you, Regan Morgan, get it. Eventually, someone needs to pull the plug and make something new.”

“You.” I felt my heart climbing my throat and my face burning red, “You killed-”

“Repurposed.”

“Stripped away, the thoughts and being of all these souls, these universes because You got bored!”

“Yes!” I AM answered, glee in Its voice “It’s different every time. Sometimes everyone dies, sometimes the world achieves eternal peace, sometimes every anomaly is contained. A billion endings for a billion stories and a billion more lying ahead! I’ve seen so much Regan, so many things have kept my attention glued below but to be honest, recently I’ve lost interest. Nothing surprised me, when you live as long as Me you realize how quickly you see everything. I&#39;ve seen every story&#39;s every iteration, and I&#39;ve seen every person&#39;s different choices play out to completion. I&#39;ve seen it all and burned it all. Sure exploration and wars were still fun but what was the point when I knew what they’d find or who would win? I was just about to pull the plug and start again but then you and Connery found Me. No one has ever found me before.”

“We aren’t your game,” I said behind a glare.

“Yes,” I AM said, not as a form of belittlement, but as a form of correction, “You are, I created every atom that makes up every cell in your body, I put every thought in your head, I tattooed your morals and ideals inside your mind, I’ve seen every person you’ve ever been. Which makes it so incredible that this doubt exists in my head. Why can something like you, existing beneath Me, find Me, contact Me, understand Me.”

“Because I’m not beneath you!”

“Yes, you are! I own you as much as you own the books in your library,” I AM did a twirl in the air, “But still you’ve changed something within Me, affected Me, I’ve never been more excited to see what comes next!”

“I kill you.” I said, deadpan, “The next thing that will happen will be me killing you.”

Silence floated in the air once again before I AM laughed, “Kill Me? Regan, let’s not get ahead of ourselves, you’re starting to bore me. We both know you have no way of doing that, everything that exists in this reality, all the tools at your disposal are made by Me. Why would I create an item that could harm Me? The only thing you have benefitting you, Regan, is my attention, other than that you’re nothing.”

“I don’t care.” I said pointing at the spark, rage boiled inside of me, I felt the collective pain and suffering every soul experienced due to this thing’s attention span, “I found You, out here in the void. I don’t care that You see me as lesser, as beneath You, as nothing. I didn’t live my life for Your benefit, my struggles weren’t meant for Your entertainment! I didn’t find my sister’s dead body and mourn to keep Your attention! I am! I am a person. A thinking, feeling, thing and I’ll be the reason You die.”

I AM stared at me, It could have killed me a billion times over, taken me apart atom by atom, and splay what was once me across the stars. It could have but I knew it wouldn’t.

“You amaze me like no other.” I AM said with a smile, “This has me so immersed. I will spend every second of My time with My eyes on you. Regan Morgan, I can’t wait to see what you do next.”

I woke up in the machine and wrote this down. I should call One, he’s going to want to hear this

**Special Containment Procedures**: To effectively limit SCP-7570-1’s influence on reality certain measures must be taken to ensure the entity&#39;s attention is held. The Foundation will expend all resources necessary to stoke global conflicts, fund space exploration, limit anomaly capture, and keep Foundation opposition operational. Screenings show that without Foundation interference world peace could have been achieved on three separate occasions and anomalous activity could, and still can be, resolved entirely. Above all else, however, Senior Researcher Regan Morgan must be kept safe and continue her research on SCP-7570-1.
------------
**Description**: SCP-7570-1 is an all-powerful, immortal, deity that resides within our reality, observing from afar. Despite being far beyond us in power, SCP-7570-1 seems to have a similar attention span and mannerisms with that of a normal human being, albeit one that suffers from severe narcissism and lack of empathy. Because of this, SCP-7570-1 has the potential to erase the current universe if It loses interest. SCP-7570-1 has demonstrated this ability numerous times and it is believed that the only reason the current universe is still here is because of SCP-7570-1’s fixation on Senior Researcher Regan Morgan.

**Addendum**: I think I found something: [REDACTED].
