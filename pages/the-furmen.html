So I feel like I should start this off by saying I&#39;ve been meaning to write this for a while now. I&#39;ve been a lurker for months and I don&#39;t think that my story is worth sharing but I feel like I have to talk about this with //someone//.

To give you some context -- I live in a small Polish village located in god-knows-where. It&#39;s your standard shit location with a swamp in place of roads and other awful terrain modifications throughout (I&#39;ll attach a picture of what the surrounding of my home looks like). It never bothered me -- if you live here your entire life for generations it stops being a problem. It&#39;s a sort of &#34;live here die here&#34; situation, really. Naturally, when I turned 18 I had to find a job due to the beautiful situation we live in, so I started doing the only thing I was good at -- fucking around with cables.

You see, we only have one power line here, meaning that if it goes dark, //it all goes dark//. There were situations in the past where we lost light for literal weeks due to lightning destroying one pillar or another, so naturally someone has to keep it in a good state at all times. As the &#34;little mechanic&#34; of the family I volunteered to inherit this title. We haven&#39;t had a person to watch over the lines for a solid month now -- the previous one touched an open wire, resulting from the constant rain we have here, and fell down the entire pillar. They took him to the hospital and that&#39;s the last I saw of him -- I&#39;ve never been told what happened.

Anyways, I&#39;ve been doing this every day for almost a year now -- get up the tower, check if everything&#39;s fine, get down the tower, repeat for every single one of them, report it to the asshole supervisor in another town, -- the same routine for years. But what&#39;s truly great about it is that up there, you can see so, so much. Every time I get up one of them I can feel the breeze in the air and actually see more than 4 meters in front of me due to the everpresent fog, and so I do it -- the part of the routine I didn&#39;t mention was looking over the horizon, hoping to see something new among the half-dead trees.

[[div class=&#34;scp-image-block block-right&#34; style=&#34;width:{$width}; margin-top: 1.2em;&#34;]]

And oh how I regret wanting that.

You see, the day is as any other -- I wake up to bad weather, get something to eat, get to the towers. But this time... there was something different. First of all, I noticed that almost all of my bread is gone (I know how dumb this sounds but trust me, if the closest bakery was an hour worth of time from you, you&#39;d know how terrifying it is to see your main food supply gone), which I blamed on me being drunk and doing some dumb shit with it. Admittedly, I did drink a little too much the day before, but I&#39;ve never gone as far as to literally rid myself of essential supplies. When I got to my first tower however is when stuff started getting really weird. The ladder was opened. For those that don&#39;t know, whenever you get down again you&#39;re always supposed to close the ladder so that &#34;something doesn&#39;t happen to it&#34; -- it&#39;s one of these things you start to do mechanically after a while that was created so children wouldn&#39;t climb it or something similar. Yet, here it was, opened like nothing happened. I was confused, be it a little unsettled, but I blamed it on some random kid wanting to climb the thing. It happens from time to time -- not even the stories of literal experts dying there would help it. As normal, I climbed the ladder, trying to do my job, and the moment I looked around myself is when I noticed it. 

In the corner of my eye, I noticed a small, black shape, slowly moving towards the treeline. It moved slowly but surely, like it was trying to make sure no one was looking at it. Like it //knew// someone might be watching.

I know some people would (and did) say that it most likely was just a human. But I&#39;m somehow sure it wasn&#39;t. Whatever that was, it was much well, bigger than anyone else I&#39;ve known, and it was almost pitch black in appearance. The second I looked at it frontally, it disappeared. 

Initially, I dismissed it as me still being drunk, but when a breathalyzer (almost everyone has one in Poland) test showed that I had no alcohol in my body, I was sure it&#39;s not it. Of course no one believed me -- my sister told me I&#39;m insane and that I should be sent to an asylum and my father didn&#39;t even want to listen to me. If only my mother was still able to talk, I&#39;m sure she would have believed me.

But that&#39;s beside the point. It&#39;s been a couple of days since that happened, but I really can&#39;t get whatever I met out of my head. It always somehow manages to creep into my mind whenever I think of //anything//. I... I don&#39;t know what to do anymore.


I... I know this probably sounds like I&#39;m going insane, but I&#39;m really unsettled. I... I&#39;ll try to do some more research on it, but I really have no idea what&#39;s going on. If anyone has any knowledge that can help me out here, please share it with me.

I&#39;m losing my mind.

I&#39;ve tried to stop thinking about the whole situation and just... leave it be like nothing happened, //but I can&#39;t//. No matter how hard I try there&#39;s always something that accidentally reminds me of what happened. I... I didn&#39;t go to work for four days straight, but that didn&#39;t help. I can&#39;t stop thinking about this.

I&#39;ve looked through every single book we have here trying to find //something// on what that might be. I&#39;ve obviously heard all of the old stories about gargoyles and whatnot, but I always dismissed it as nonsense, even now.

Until today. 

Looking back through my childhood stuff I accidentally found an old fairytale book of mine. Here in Poland, we have a lot of really disturbing stories -- weird, weird stuff you forget the moment you close the book. But there&#39;s always been a sore thumb in that -- the story of the Furmen. Basically, it&#39;s a story of how two children wander into the woods to find the [[[esterberg-city-wikipedia|magical refugee city]]] of the mystical Furmen and are never seen again. That&#39;s it. No moral, no anything -- just this. It always seemed weird to me -- all other stories had some sort of a conclusion or weird twist, but this one... never had one. As kids we quickly forgot about it, but now that I remembered it, I had to give it another look. I just couldn&#39;t stop myself.

But this time was different. The story wasn&#39;t just weird; it was... unsettling, almost. I noticed the story went into excruciating detail about how the creatures looked despite making only one real appearance, almost ignoring everything else. You miss this stuff as a kid, but I noticed that there were no descriptions of the kids. Only the Furmen and their forest lairs, looking at them with their giant eyes. But even today, there was no answer as to what happened to them.


But what unsettled me the most is //what// the description was showing them to be. They are supposedly 3 meters tall and have black hair. It fits perfectly. Even their sketch in the book looks the same.

I think I&#39;m going insane. I mean, fuck, I&#39;m believing a fairy tale literally describing mystical creatures. I know this is utterly insane, but... it perfectly fits.

I need an answer. Any answer. I&#39;ll do anything to find it.

I&#39;m not going insane and I have proof of it.

Can you see this? If you zoom in well enough you&#39;ll see that someone is sitting there. Someone with black fur and 3 meters tall. It literally fits perfectly. There is no way it is anyone else. Hell, I&#39;m the tallest in the village and I&#39;m 1.7 meters tall.

I took the photo when I went out with my dog; I thought that his smell would find something. You know, you always see on TV how dogs help out in these cases or whatever -- I know my thought process is idiotic, but it was the best I could do. 

When my dog started barking like he&#39;s gone insane is when I took it. It was just sitting there, looking at me. Nothing more. Not a single move. When I blinked, it was gone in the fog. Just like that. I tried looking around where it sat, but there was nothing. My dog was beyond confused, like it felt a smell or something it had no idea what it was. And that&#39;s what worries me the most. My dog&#39;s family has been with us for literal generations; they know these swamps better than us. //And he doesn&#39;t recognize the smell//. Like, yeah, we have had dogs disappear in the past, but, we literally live in a swamp. They sometimes get lost when they run away. Sure, we always do a search, but we thought it was natural. We&#39;ve had it happen to people in the past, but it was always just thought to be them getting stuck in a swamp... but I don&#39;t know anymore. 

I don&#39;t know what to do anymore and if I&#39;m just simply not going insane and seeing patterns where there are none. I know that happens; hell, I&#39;ve been reading these forums for a while now, and I know that reading this stuff makes you do that, but this can&#39;t just be my imagination, right?

I got it. I... please, if anyone has any knowledge of what they are and what they want, //help me out//. I need any information I can gather. I... my sister and father are going away this week to the city and I can&#39;t just tell her I want them to stay because I&#39;m chased by a goddamn monster. I need to know what to do. Please, please, please help me out here. I need to find any information on them. I need to know how to protect myself. It never happens in these posts and I need to know that. Please, please help me.

Please, help me.

I saw something again. It... it looked at me. From the woods, it looked at me directly through my window. I don&#39;t leave the house anymore. I feel like I&#39;m being constantly watched. I haven&#39;t shown up to work in ages now, //but for some reason no one cares//. I can&#39;t talk to anyone except you because only you will ever possibly believe me. Fairytales are known to inspire creativity in children and I&#39;ve always been a not so mature person and I know that if I tell this to anyone I will come off as insane and no one will believe me.  Please, help me. I barricaded my front door and let my dog inside so that I have a single companion. He&#39;s the only one I can trust -- he saw what I saw and knows something is wrong. I don&#39;t know what to do anymore. Please, I need //anything//.

I saw footsteps outside my home today. At first I thought it was just a bear and I&#39;m exaggerating stuff, but they were way too big to be a bear&#39;s. They are absolutely giant. But the worst part of them is that they were shallow. Which means that whatever made them didn&#39;t sink into the mud.

I need to do something. I can&#39;t call the police -- the nearest police station is literally 23 kilometers of swamp from me. But even if they came, what do you think I would tell them? That I&#39;m being stalked by monsters?

I need to do something. I need to find where they come from and what they want. I need to do something. Please, you people know this stuff. I need help now.

In my panic I&#39;ve read literally every single thread concerning anything similar on this goddamn idiotic website. Every single one of them, each one more stupid than the last one. Nothing. Not a single one similar. 

So I went on similar websites, like Reddit out of all places. I found that someone had an encounter with a ghost and then released themselves by helping it out. now I know it was stupid but I thought that if I do the same it would work too, because that&#39;s the only way I thought would ever work. And so I did.

In a state of prime desperation, I took my grandpa&#39;s old war backpack and a flashlight... I hoped to follow back the footsteps to whatever made them and... confront it or help it in some way or //something//. I know it&#39;s dumb as hell, but it&#39;s the best I could do then. I should have so stayed inside.

I got my best shoes and got out into the forest, frantically checking every corner of my eye. I literally cried out of pure stress. Every minute of me walking down these foggy bogs felt like a literal hour of a chore through literal oil. I was so scared. I don&#39;t know how, but I made it safely into the treeline. Even though I knew that&#39;s where whatever stalked me lived, I felt much safer there. Like I could mask from them now. Like... like I wasn&#39;t just a hunted animal anymore but an equal rival.

That&#39;s when I found it. After what felt like literal billions of years of navigating through a dimly lit half-dead bog filled with fog, I found an opening. I don&#39;t know how, but... light felt different in that place. There was no fog and the sky was clear. But oh my god how I regret initially being happy upon my discovery. 

I found a graveyard. A graveyard no one has ever known about. It&#39;s not on any map, not //anything//; not a single story from my childhood describes it. And trust me, in my 21 years here I thought I&#39;ve heard everything.


The graves in it were... //nonhuman//. There was no reason to their location or their shapes. The descriptions of who laid there were literally unreadable. It&#39;s hard to describe it well, but the whole thing didn&#39;t feel like it was made by //us//. But the worst part of it was that there were fresh footsteps.


I tried digging it up to see if it wasn&#39;t just me being insane and if I haven&#39;t stumbled into some forgotten soldiers burial ground from the Wars, but oh god how I wish it was. 


In these graves, there was something I couldn&#39;t describe. Like it wasn&#39;t human. Long, grey bones filled with leaf-like decorations I never saw in my life. Items that looked like toys made out of wood. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been that scared. Hell, I literally cried when a bird started singing near me.

I initially thought that getting out there was a good idea but I realized it was the stupidest one of my life. I didn&#39;t want anything more than to get back home and call //someone//, hell //anyone//. I literally sprinted like I never did before.

But it got worse.

I tried running back home as fast as I could, sprinting the best I could, not feeling any tiredness or exhaustion. Adrenaline pumped through my veins like through an engine.

And that&#39;s when I fell down a loose opening beneath the ground. I fell down what I think was 2 meters. It&#39;s a miracle I didn&#39;t die on some random goddamn spike knowing my stupid luck, but I somehow survived. It was... a tomb. A tomb that //someone lived in//. I know how fucking stupid that sounds, but... there was no dust in it. Like someone kept the place clean.

I tried finding a way out, only to find weird items, such as wooden idols and totems, spears, and things... things made from plants I couldn&#39;t explain. I tried taking a photo of them, but whenever I did it just didn&#39;t show up in photos. I thought I was going insane, but I could literally touch it. I wandered through halls that looked like storage rooms and places that felt like lair-like caves of //something//. 

I wanted to leave so badly. Just as my flashlight was about to die, I found a way out -- a staircase leading outside.

And that&#39;s when I saw it.

A pair of yellow, glowing eyes, looking directly into my soul from my left.

I ran away as quickly as I could. I literally left everything else behind and ran, even faster than before, even faster than I thought anyone could run.


It felt like literally centuries, but I somehow made it. I&#39;ve locked myself in the supply room with a shotgun and some water and a phone. I can hear them walking around my house. I can hear banging on my doors. Please send help. I don&#39;t know where my dog is. I don&#39;t know where anyone is. I&#39;m all alone here. I have literally one dot of internet and I can barely load up this stupid website to beg for help. Even if I call the police now, they won&#39;t do anything. They won&#39;t arrive in time. I&#39;ve lost all phone contact with my sister, I don&#39;t know what do to anymore. I have lost all chances. Please. I don&#39;t know what to do. Please help me. Please, please help me.

Checking from their profile, it looks like they weren&#39;t active ever since they posted that final post. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s nothing serious -- from what they told in chat I believe it&#39;s around the time of the year they go to the town for some supplies; I imagine they don&#39;t have access to the computer, and even if they do, posting here probably isn&#39;t a priority. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s all well and good.
