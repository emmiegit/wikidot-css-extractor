You will notice little &#39;📈&#39; emojis beside some articles. That denotes SCP articles which were under 30 and tales which were under 20 when this edition of site news was posted. Give them a little love! Speaking from personal experience, the most frustrating thing that can happen to an article is not deletion, but stagnating below 20 without any comments. So try to read, vote, and comment on these articles! They&#39;re often hidden gems :)

+++ Staff Spotlight
**January spotlight:** Community Outreach: Contests
**Featuring:** [[*user Procyonlotor]]
**Interviewer:** [[*user WhiteGuard]]

------

1. Hello there, Procyonlotor! How about we start with what exactly the Contests subteam of Community Outreach specifically does?

&gt; The Contests Subteam, probably unsurprisingly, helps incubate and run contests for the greater wiki. In truth, it&#39;s not really a &#34;subteam&#34; in the way that Community Outreach (or indeed, other teams&#39;) subteams are, as it has little permanent structure beyond the two captains of Community Outreach, currently myself and taylor_itkin. But our basic duties are coming up with, scheduling, running, and closing contests. Anything to do with an official contest is in our wheelhouse.

2. What does the average day of being a member of this subteam look like whenever a contest is being run?

&gt; Honestly? Day to day, it&#39;s an extremely low-stress position, with little to do other than wait and watch. But that comes at the cost of it being extremely stressful when it does arrive. Putting pages together, announcing winners, and investigating irregularities are all very unpleasant tasks that occur under tight (if sometimes self-imposed) deadlines. I&#39;ve learned how to make it all easier on myself and the subteam during my time on the job, but it can still be really exhausting! But luckily, seeing your work in the background result in stellar new pieces being posted to the wiki makes it all extremely worth it.

3. You are a Captain of Community Outreach. What is it about this team and specifically about the Contests subteam that appeals to you?

&gt; Perhaps surprisingly, I actually kind of bumbled my way into Captaincy. When Decibelles retired from her captaincy, she felt that (my former co-captain) ARD and I were the only people who were on the team who were able to take up the mantle. Neither of us had been particularly active on the team beforehand, but I like to think we took up the mantle well.
&gt;
&gt; I chose contests for what will likely seem a strange reason: I **hated** them. I felt with the way they had traditionally been run, with all respect to my predecessors, it encouraged a strain of toxicity among competitors and led to large increases of drama. My goal in taking over Contests was to stop this from happening. And while I&#39;d be lying if I said contests were a drama-free affair even now, I hope that people feel far more positively about them now than when I took over the position.

4. Breaking away from the staff-side of things, what is a work on the site that you have recently read that you enjoyed and what was done right with it?

&gt; It will likely be a somewhat non-traditional choice, but one of my favorite traditions on the wiki has been the Gearsday Creepypasta collections, and [[[surprise-happy-birthday-8|this year&#39;s]]] was no exception. It was actually Gears&#39; creepypasta that made me stick around the site, nearly a decade ago (goddamn!), and I&#39;ve always had a soft spot for the genre when done well. And our site members always do it well.

5. You have been a member of staff for 7 years now. That is a long time, buddy. What has kept you around?

&gt; It&#39;s not necessarily any one thing in particular, and it&#39;s different things at different times. Sometimes it&#39;s the quality of work on the wiki, and the pride I feel in playing a part in ensuring it remains accessible to those who want to read it. Sometimes it&#39;s my friends in the community. Sometimes it&#39;s the fact I really, really, really want to make a change in policy. Sometimes it&#39;s just inertia. And sometimes, I just like having something meaningful to do when I get up in the morning. A lot of times, it&#39;s all of those things.

++* Q: Can I replace a blurb that you wrote for one of my articles with my own? I&#39;m not satisfied with it.

A: Absolutely. You will always have that option at any point.

++* Q: I noticed an error/typo/incorrect information and wish to correct it. May I?

A: Sure! If the changes are not limited to your own article(s) and/or are substantial changes across multiple entries, you should post in that month&#39;s discussion page and then make the changes.

++* Q: I wrote an article and it seems to have stuck. Can I send a blurb of mine to one of the frequent collaborators?

A: Yup! It&#39;s much easier if you come to us about it, and it gives you the control over what you want shown on the news page.
