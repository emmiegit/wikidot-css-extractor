This is a full log of all SCP-6607 instances. New entries are to be added using the following template:

[[code]]

||= SCP-6607-X || Instance description. ||

[[/code]]

[[/div]]

||~ Instance ||~ Anomalous Effects ||
||= SCP-6607-13 || The processing lines of 181 slaughterhouses were affixed with demonic sigils disguised as health and safety signage. Animal death within any of these environments produces amounts of FSE roughly equivalent to that found in ritual animal sacrifice.||
||= SCP-6607-92 || When this instance is performed, all seawater within a 100 m radius is transmuted into B positive human blood, generating an amount of FSE proportional to the quantity of water in range. Blood produced by this instance is not to be used in transfusions under any circumstance.||
||= SCP-6607-167 || The road layout of 45 cities were retrocausally altered to resemble various demonic sigils. Thaumic scans have determined that all instances of vehicle damage and &#34;road rage&#34; that take place in these cities generate FSE. ||
||= SCP-6607-200 || The first letter of Shell plc, a British oil and gas corporation, temporarily vanished during the performance of this instance. Following its completion, all of Shell&#39;s operations have been observed to continuously generate trace amounts of FSE. It is probable that this will gradually alter the spiritual physiology of Shell&#39;s board of directors, rendering them unable to &#34;pass on&#34; to a non-demonic afterlife.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]//Considering the moral implications of Shell&#39;s role in the ongoing climate crisis, I highly doubt that they would&#39;ve ended up anywhere else. --Salazar//[[/span]]||
||= SCP-6607-244 || The [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4294 Darvaza gas crater][[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Otherwise known as the &#34;Gates of Hell&#34; or &#34;Door to Hell.&#34;[[/span]] has become a one-way dimensional gateway to the Fourth Circle of Hell. It appears to be converting the non-thaumaturgic energy produced by its burning gas into FSE. ||
||= SCP-6607-328 || The sound of children&#39;s laughter was audible during the performance of this instance. Upon its completion, the logo of Monster Energy was subtly altered the resemble an upside-down demonic symbol that roughly translates to: &#34;All glory to the dread lords of the Second Circle.&#34; The act of flipping a can of Monster Energy reorients the symbol to a right side up position, generating a slight amount of FSE in the process. ||
||= SCP-6607-356 || Demonic incantations were embedded in the code of the encyclopedia website Wikipedia. As a result, FSE is generated out of the website&#39;s servers whenever a malicious and disinformative edit is created on any page. Such types of edits made to pages regarding theological topics, especially towards heaven, God or other equivalant subjects, seem to create a significant increase in FSE production.||
||= SCP-6607-401 || Increased usage of [[[SCP-2336]]] for general Foundation operations has caused a notable increase in global FSE production. ||
||= SCP-6607-445 || Upon completion of the ritual, all the marmalade in Ohio, USA was transformed into a mixture of human organs and blood, although still resembling its original aspect. Eating it without noticing its true nature results in a light FSE energy generation. Eating it while noticing its true nature results in a considerable FSE energy generation. ||
||= SCP-6607-496 || When this instance is performed, ritual participants will be relocated to the stage of an unknown theater, with an audience composed of several demonic entities. These entities will generate FSE when they laugh, and as such subjects must enact comedic routines and plays to achieve proper production. Peculiarly, the inclusion of clowns in performances increases humour.||
||= SCP-6607-500 || Several &#34;life-hack&#34; entertainment channels on platforms such as YouTube have begun to include highly specific and dangerous advice in their content. Humans injured or killed while attempting to replicate these &#34;hacks&#34; count as ritual sacrifices for the purpose of FSE generation. ||
