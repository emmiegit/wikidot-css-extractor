**Item #:** SCP-498

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-498 is to be contained within a sound-proof bunker beneath Site ██, with a minimum of two attending Foundation Security Officers, properly equipped with noise-canceling headphones in addition to standard-issue equipment.  The bunker is to be sound-proofed to noise-cancel a minimum of 95% of outgoing sound waves.  

A fully automated mechanical arm is to be used to reset SCP-498.  --Secondary Containment Procedure:  In the event of failure, two D-Class personnel are to be locked inside with an appropriate amount of rations.  They are to be informed fully of its effects and to alternate shifts sleeping and resetting SCP-498 until the failure is repaired.  Security footage sans audio of the chamber is to be monitored at all times.--  Following Incident I498-B, in the event of failure an on-site Foundation Security Officer is to be sent in to manually reset until such a time automated safety procedures can be reinstated.

**Description:**  SCP-498 appears to be a Koway Brand RT-800 electronic alarm clock with yellow LED display, set to the U.S. Central Time Zone.  When heard by a subject, the alarm has been seen to induce a state of increased alertness until reset.  This effect prevents restful sleep in SCP-498&#39;s vicinity, although micro-naps are possible.  Other than the &#34;snooze&#34; button and the display, none of the other functions on the device appear operational.  Notably, the device continues to display time and require resetting even while not connected to a power source.  Attempts to dismantle SCP-498 have not been successful in preventing it from activating, nor have they determined how it operates without an obvious power source.

Every 11 minutes, the clock&#39;s alarm goes off, gradually increasing in volume.  Testing reveals that the starting alarm plays at 30 dB, increasing 4 dB every 10 seconds the snooze button is not depressed.   There has been no evidence that this process will ever stop; the loudest recorded level exceeded ███ dB before reset was achieved.  The sound waves produced have been seen to damage nearby structures, cause internal bleeding, and are theorized to potentially cause seismic activity.

**Addendum 498-A:**  Containment Protocol updated.  See Incident Report I498-B.

&gt; **Incident Report I498-B:** 
&gt;  ██/██/██, Site ██, Containment Bunker ███
&gt; 
&gt; Due to a malfunction in the automated mechanical arm, Secondary Containment Procedures were activated.  Two D-Class personnel were utilized until a replacement arm could be manufactured and deployed.  D-4112 and D-4113 were in day 3 of their containment procedure, and post-incident psycho analysis indicate severe sleep deprivation and stress due to prolonged exposure to SCP-498.  The two D-Class were observed conversing during this time, although lip-reading proved to be ineffective in determining the nature of the conversation.  
&gt; 
&gt; At 10:45:06 pm, D-4113 was observed depressing the snooze button on the device.
&gt; 
&gt; 10:56:39 pm, D-4112 begins to become noticeably and increasingly agitated, gesturing toward SCP-498 and D-4113.
&gt; 
&gt; 10:57:04 pm, D-4113 is seen becoming more and more aggressive.  D-4112 appears to be attempting to reason with him.
&gt; 
&gt; 10:57:50 pm, D-4112 attempts to reach for the device.  D-4113 pushes D-4112 away.  At this time, the attending Security Officers noticed the situation via closed-circuit camera.
&gt; 
&gt; 10:58:23 pm, SCP-498 has still not been reset.  Attending Security Officers decide to intervene. 
&gt; 
&gt; 10:58:45 pm, D-4112 and D-4113 are seen shouting at one another, with the latter standing over SCP-498.  Security Officer ███████ Wilson enters the bunker without noise-canceling headphones, a violation of Containment Protocol.
&gt; 
&gt; 10:58:53 pm, Officer Wilson appears to be arguing with the two D-Class, presumably ordering them to reset the device.  
&gt; 
&gt; 10:59:08 pm, D-4112 again attempts to reach SCP-498, at which point he is struck by D-4113 and incapacitated.
&gt; 
&gt; 10:59:12 pm, Officer Wilson draws his baton and engages D-4113.
&gt; //Note:   D-4113 was convicted of murdering his CO and several fellow soldiers during a tour of duty in Iraq.//
&gt; 
&gt; 10:59:24 pm, D-4113 wrestles the baton from Officer Wilson, subsequently subduing him.  Second Security Officer ██████ Thomas enters at this point, equipped with headphones and his side arm.
&gt; 
&gt; 10:59:29 pm, Officer Thomas draws his side arm and fires twice, missing both times before D-4113 closes the distance between them.  A scuffle ensues.
&gt; 
&gt; 10:59:46 pm, Officer Thomas&#39; headphones are knocked away.  Both personnel are exhibiting severe pain at this point, presumably due to SCP-498.  Camera footage vibrating due to acoustic stress.
&gt; 
&gt; 11:00:02 pm, Officer Thomas manages to put distance between himself and D-4113 and fire his sidearm.  D-4113 is terminated.  Officer Thomas stumbles from the bunker, sealing SCP-498 and the occupants inside.  Despite ruptured eardrums, he managed to activate the Containment Breach Emergency Switch before passing out.
&gt; 
&gt; 11:01:56 pm, camera fails due to acoustic stress.
&gt; 
&gt; 11:25:58 pm, due to an unrelated simultaneous breach at Site ██,  containment teams arrived nearly 25 minutes after the alarm was activated.  Upon arriving at the scene, it was discovered that D-4112 had at some point crawled himself to SCP-498 and activated the snooze reset.  He was found repeatedly depressing the button, despite suffering from burst eardrums and internal bleeding.
&gt; 
&gt; **After Action Report**
&gt; New containment protocol initiated.  Both Security Officers ███████ Wilson and ██████ Thomas were diagnosed with eardrum rupture, resulting in deafness.  Officer Wilson treated for severe internal bleeding.  Both re-assigned.  D-4112 was treated for severe internal bleeding, commended for preventing a potentially catastrophic containment breach, and successfully terminated at the end of the month.
