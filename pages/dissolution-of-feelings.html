Darkness, skepticism, and dread permeating
sadness, concealed from the heart 
by those who only know
to see and breathe and believe
What is moral, righteous, and courteous 
to offer is what is nice, kind, and living.
like the wonder of passing angels
Faith that bends the way dread presses 
in on the sensations and produces fear that limits 
the heart&#39;s healing is on the path to spreading grace.

River roars, peaceful and continuing
saying the verses of the serenity prayer
bringing back the past&#39;s stillness,
Getting knowledge ready to discover the truth
The delights of the colors of joy
From the safety, promises are flowing
fading petals, praises under the wings
Knowing the kind words and amazing charity of the hopeless,
The emotions mixed with icy
Mornings, songs with inactive notes
bringing the soul that is so alert to peace
when the moon is obscured by the sun.

the summertime as nighttime fades
Where comforting warmth envelops 
Where comforting warmth envelops 
the mind with visions of inspiration 
and hope to calm the spirit and let flowers flourish in the gentle rain, 
nurturing care, and quieting the voice of the storm
While singing as it interacts with the lush, cold soil
Where there is the understanding and the longing, 
oak and pine clasp the sky and abide high.
For a day that pays attention to the wind 
Shouting through the mood, a tear falls softly as they break the despair, 
Darkness and maniacal anguish are swinging
In the afternoon, gloomy depressions sway.

The illness is what gives the dawn its color.
letting go of sighs of doubt and whispering
Dismay, discouragement, and dim details
discovered among the miserable, lonely
Pale echoes of nothingness in the mind
who only recall the necessity and the difficulties
The needs of the poor who arrive
Through the persistent anxiety into the fragments
Recollections, mysterious anxieties, and mistrust
keeping in mind to express the desires
an emotion and mental state
Attracted to the hefty

Heartbeat of missed tranquility and abandoned hopes
by the booming anguish of the night, erased
Existing in the consciousness of the knowledgeable
Bipolar disorder changes life from death, signs
Relationships have taken lives, 
and friends and family have recently lost loved ones.
Who knows what staying put forever means?
The unknowable courtyard where the illness is
Is a fog obscuring all the hues and luminous shades?
The shadows hide the figures.
who only have ears to hear the frenzy, the anonymous
From a disease that never feels very real, a kiss

It is a maddening touch that makes the silence worse.
With a ferocious pursuit of fulfillment, exhausted, 
and filled with cries for light to dispel this darkness
