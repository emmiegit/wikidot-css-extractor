Everyone in the room is talking about the election. Most agree it was a mess from start to finish. The editor says both candidates had problems that concerned them. ‘The lesser of two evils’ is a repeating phrase. Nobody has said which one is the president-elect.

The sky outside the building is sky blue and empty. A few cars drive past on the street. A group of pedestrians are wearing oversized hats. Some of the people walking past stare at them. A man sits at a corner with a sign asking for money.

Edward is staring at the page on his screen. It is a story he has been writing for years now. He doesn’t feel any closer to finishing it than when he started. He doesn’t feel satisfied by the progress he makes. He doesn’t enjoy writing it anymore. He’s only working on it because he feels worse when he doesn’t.

He hasn’t made any progress today. He will try again tomorrow.

Everyone in the room is talking about Vanguard. Most agree it felt like a hoax at first. The editor talks about the new Lighthouse nearby. ##green|CITIZEN## says they met a talking dog that works there. Nobody has noticed the owner is happier lately.

The sky outside the building is sky blue and empty. A few cars drive past on the street. A taxi honks at a jaywalker. Some of the people walking past stare at them. A man sits at a corner with a sign accusing the Foundation.

Edward is staring at the page on his screen. It is a different page with different words. He doesn’t feel any closer to finishing it than when he started. He doesn’t feel satisfied by the progress he makes. He doesn’t enjoy writing it anymore. He’s only working on it because he feels worse when he doesn’t.

He hasn’t made any progress today. He will try again tomorrow.

Everyone in the room is talking about the Infoscare. Most agree they do not understand Vanguard’s explanation. The editor says lots of ##green|PEOPLE## like ##green|CITIZEN## had their identities permanently stolen. The owner says you can still be affected if you talk about it. Nobody knows how to protect themselves if it happens again.

The sky outside is sky blue and empty. A few cars drive past on the street. A group of pedestrians have metal limbs and horns. Some of the people walking past stare at them. A man sits at a corner with a sign foretelling the rapture.

Edward is staring at the page on his screen. It is a different page with different words. He doesn’t feel any closer to finishing it than when he started. He doesn’t feel satisfied by the progress he makes. He doesn’t enjoy writing it anymore. He’s only working on it because he feels worse when he doesn’t.

He hasn’t made any progress today. He will try again tomorrow.

Everyone in the room is talking. Most agree things are going well. The editor is talking to ##green|CITIZEN## and a faerie by the watercooler. The owner has eight eyes and is seven feet tall. Nobody bothers the sasquatch kicking the printer.

The sky outside the building is sky blue. A dragon is following a plane. A few cars drive past on the street. Some of the pedestrians are trees. A group of wizards jaywalk. Some of the people walking past stare at them. A man sits at a corner with a sign offering oracles.
