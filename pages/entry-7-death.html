Imagine my surprise, waking up covered in goop, everything is cold and dark. There’s a statue of Ucello of all things sitting next to strangely nostalgic tent. For a second I thought this was my final dream-like hallucination of my warped childhood memories as I rotted away on the ground. Then I realized I was in a replicator.

I followed that magic compass in my head through these trees until I found the journal, and me.

One step too far back, ground gave way. Broke my neck. Kind of an anti-climatic death.

I don’t remember anything past my body falling apart as I hit the button on the replicator. But it looks like I predicted this in the most //me// way possible, with that snarky note. I spent the rest of the night reading through everything I’ve written so far. Looks like I have to pick up where I left off.

------

I gathered up the tools I’d made. By some miracle the water bottle hadn’t broken. Cushioned by one of the softer parts of my body, I’m sure. Speaking of, I had to deal with the old me.

After closing my eyes and crossing my hands on my chest, I left my body to become the sustenance for whatever freaks call that ravine their home. Not that I didn’t feel for it, my body’s just another tool, and when it’s broken beyond repair I have to let it go. Just another habit of a former nomad.

Makes me wonder, though. Was that me? According to the company, the replicator transfers your consciousness and memories to your new body. I&#39;m sure they have ways of proving it, not that I&#39;ve seen them. But what if it&#39;s really just a cloning machine? What if I really died, and I&#39;m just a copy? What if?

It doesn&#39;t really matter. I can&#39;t know for sure while I&#39;m stuck here. And as long as I have the replicator, some version of me will escape this place.
