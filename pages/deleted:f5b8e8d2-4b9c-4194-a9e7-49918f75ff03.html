Object Class: Euclid

Containment Procedure:SCP-6905 is kept in Site-19,inside a display case. There is no other special containment procedure for SCP-6905.

Description:SCP-6694 appears to be an black phantom mask with no special features except missing it&#39;s half. The object was retrieved from a U.S. navel base specifically Pearl Harbor. SCP-6694 was brought to the attention of the SCP foundation after a viral videos of a mask being dubbed as &#34;Unbreakable&#34;. 

In the video, the mask was seen being crushed using a hydraulic press at 100 tons, the mask remained unscathed. In one of the videos, a person ran over the mask using a car at full speed. Not only was the car flipped because of it&#39;s speed but the mask was not damaged at all.


SCP-6905 could not be put on people as it simply teleports to the ground when someone tries putting it on someone. This could indicate that the mask is either alive or senses someone&#39;s motion or intention. It&#39;s durability was tested from hacking it using an axe to blowing it up did nothing. Further testing is required. The following interview below was about the director and the researcher researching the mask.

**Interviewed:Researcher**

**Interviewer:Director** 

**Foreword:The director sighed as he looked at the paper the researcher gave him**

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Director:&#34;So this is all the data we have?&#34;** 

**Researcher:&#34;Yes,all we know about SCP 6905 is that it can teleport and is indestructable. We couldn&#39;t test putting it on people because it keeps on teleporting on the ground, it seems like it knows our intention of putting it on people and decides to teleport away.&#34;**

**Director:&#34;Thank you for your research, you may leave.&#34;**

As the researcher turned to leave, he looked back at the director.
Â 
**Researcher:&#34;Before I leave, I didn&#39;t include this in the data since I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the SCP&#39;s doing or not but our D classes had a bit of problem&#34;**

The director raised a brow, indicating to continue.

**Researcher:&#34;These past few days,while looking at the D-Class lists. I noticed we skipped a few numbers, we have D-Class 35,36 and 38. I talked with the group and they told me it was always like this, we skipped 37 and the usual 4 person per room were just 3.&#34;**

**Director:&#34;So where is this 37th one?&#34;**

The researcher shook his head.

**Researcher:&#34;I&#39;m not sure either. Even the guards were confused when I asked them about 37&#34;**

**Director:&#34;Hm, we might have just made a mistake then. You may leave&#34;**

**Researcher:&#34;I wish that was the case but we&#39;ve noticed that there were a lot of D class personnel only having 2-3 members in their room.&#34;**

**Director:&#34;And you only noticed just now??!!&#34;**

**Researcher:&#34;It was always like this in Site-19 even the D-class and the guards agree with me&#34;**

The director sighed

**Director:&#34;Reassign the rooms for the D class personnel and take the last numbers to fill up the missing ones. Keep testing the mask and you may leave&#34;**

The researcher bowed and left the room.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**
