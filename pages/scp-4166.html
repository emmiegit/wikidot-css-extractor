[[include component:image-block name=16632.jpg | caption=Depiction of symptoms of SCP-4166-3 stage two, recovered from SCP-4166-1&#39;s notebook. Text appears to be St Matthew 6:9-12, better known as the Lord&#39;s prayer. | width=300px]]
**Description:** SCP-4166-1 is a female human class-C reality bender responsible for the creation of SCP-4166-2 and SCP-4166-3. It displays numerous psychological ailments, including aversion to men, fear of sleeping, PTSD, and suicidality.
 
Medical analysis has discovered significant scarring on the palms, feet, and genital area. Additionally, SCP-4166-1 develops cachexia if not administered 1 cc of human semen weekly.

Every seven days, or in times of increased distress, SCP-4166-1 manifests an instance of SCP-4166-2 (if one does not currently exist).
 
SCP-4166-2 is a mute shadow-like humanoid figure with no defining visual features which otherwise exhibits typical human characteristics. Upon manifestation, SCP-4166-2 enters the room containing SCP-4166-1 through the primary method of entry, regardless of barriers. It then attempts to approach SCP-4166-1.

If SCP-4166-1 retains the memory of containment of SCP-4166-2, SCP-4166-2 proceeds to take action to counteract previous methods of containment, up to and including manifesting with weaponry. 

Upon termination, SCP-4166-2 instances demanifest instantaneously.

SCP-4166-3 is a three-phase mental illness affecting individuals who have observed an instance of SCP-4166-2, lasting for the duration of SCP-4166-2&#39;s manifestation.

[[include component:image-block name=16633.jpg | caption=Depiction of symptoms of SCP-4166-3 stage three, recovered from SCP-4166-1&#39;s notebook. Text appears to be Psalms 138:1-5. | width=300px]]
Stage one of SCP-4166-3 typically lasts two months before progressing to stage two. Symptoms include: 

* Increased irritability 
 
* Discomfort with being alone
 
* Compulsion to lock doors
 
* Increased startle response
 
* Seeing things in the periphery of vision

Stage two of SCP-4166-3 typically lasts one month before progressing to stage three. Accompanying those present during stage one, symptoms include: 

* The conviction that one was being immolated during major life events, such as birthdays or weddings (does not abate when provided with evidence otherwise).

* Visual hallucinations of shadowy hands when viewing doorknobs, lasting approximately one second.

* Aversion to religious ceremonies and masculine-presenting persons.

* Sleep paralysis.


Stage three of SCP-4166-3 lasts until the termination of SCP-4166-2. Accompanying those present during prior stages, symptoms include:

* Tactile hallucinations of hands grasping one&#39;s person, displaying no notable pattern.

* Visual hallucinations of SCP-4166-2 in empty doorways.

* Burning sensations throughout one&#39;s whole body.

* Conviction and fear of eternal suffering after death.

SCP-4166-1 was raised in a Catholic orphanage twelve years prior to the hospitalization of Father █████ in an apparent case of spontaneous combustion. Six days afterwards, the first manifestation of SCP-4166-2 occurred on 07-24-2008. During this manifestation, a gunshot attracted the attention of the nuns. Upon entering the room, they found SCP-4166-1 alone, holding a pistol at the entrance to its room. Authorities were notified of the incident, leading to the retrieval of SCP-4166

&gt; **Interviewer:** Junior Psychologist ██████ ███
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Intake session done shortly after acquisition, on 07-26-2008.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log, 13:21&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **███:** Good afternoon, SCP-4166-1.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4166-1:** Uh. I... would prefer if you. Didn&#39;t call me that. Please.
&gt; 
&gt; **███:** Apologies. Do you have a preferred manner of address?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4166-1:** I&#39;m... fuck.
&gt; 
&gt; **███:** Pardon?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4166-1:** No, I mean. I, well. I don&#39;t. Have anything I&#39;d particularly like to be called. I guess uh...
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-4166-1 remains in silence for a few moments.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4166-1:** Just. Call me uh, [SCP-4166-1] I guess? That&#39;s just my family name. Haven&#39;t picked out a new one yet.
&gt; 
&gt; **███:** Very well then. It is my pleasure to meet you, [SCP-4166-1].
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-4166-1 remains silent for a full minute.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **███:** [SCP-4166-1]? Are you okay?
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-4166-1 remains silent for ten minutes as Junior Psychologist ███ continues to take notes.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4166-1:** Haha. Uh. I guess I can&#39;t not speak this time.
&gt; 
&gt; **███:** You&#39;re free to take your time. I&#39;m here for as long as you need.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4166-1:** I... thanks. But I meant... I want to. I, uh. Intakes, right? You want to know what my deal is. You want to help. I want to help you help. So. Uh. Brace yourself? It&#39;s uh. You should.
&gt; 
&gt; **███:** Sure, [SCP-4166-1].
&gt; 
&gt; //[Ten seconds elapse.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **███:** Alright. I&#39;m ready when you are.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Twenty seconds elapse.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **███:** [SCP-4166-1]?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4166-1:** I was um. Er... like. you know? I. You know what I mean, I hope?
&gt; 
&gt; **███:** I&#39;m... afraid not.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4166-1:** Uh. God, uh. I&#39;m sorry.
&gt; 
&gt; **███:** It&#39;s alright. Take your time.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4166-1:** Yeah.. I know. I //know//. I just. God. It&#39;s hard to say. It&#39;s impossible to say. I hoped it would be obvious what my damage is, you know? I guess not though. You already know a lot of my personality from asking the nuns.
&gt; 
&gt; **███:** Yes, they told me a lot about you. How hard working you were, how devout. Albeit fearful without reason at times. They really did --
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4166-1:** You, they didn&#39;t tell you about... About me? Shit, I mean, I, I was? I am? I am those things. Or was? I don&#39;t know anymore. God. Did they tell you anything about, about uh, that?
&gt; 
&gt; **███:** Could you clarify?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4166-1:** ... No.
&gt; 
&gt; **███:** Alright.
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-4166-1 remains silent for a minute.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4166-1:** ... I&#39;m sorry. I feel so useless. So fucking pathetic. Why? Why does it have to be so fucking hard to just fucking say what I mean? I wish I could just… say it, I wish I could face it. I just. I. Do… Do you have a pen?
&gt; 
&gt; **███:** Oh, uh. Let me check. Yeah, I do. But, I just want to tell you... it&#39;s fine. You&#39;re being extremely hard on yourself for not being able to talk about things which are //hard to talk about//. My entire job is to help people find the words to process what they&#39;ve gone through, and then to help them figure out how to move on from it. You aren&#39;t useless or pathetic. So, here you go, here&#39;s a pen. Let&#39;s start from the beginning, if that&#39;s okay.

&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4166-1:** I... hated the church. I hated being there. I hated being there and feeling like I was sin. Like I was sin incarnate. They treated me like that, you know? I was five. They didn&#39;t know how to deal with me when I started being &#34;symptomatic&#34;. //[SCP-4166-1 grimaces.]// They called it weakness of the flesh. When I&#39;d cry, or say things I wasn&#39;t supposed to, or do, uh, things inappropriate for my age. I was hit. I was shunned. I was made to repent.
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-4166-1 pauses.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4166-1:** I was worthless. I was a demon. And every Sunday, they made me sit in the pews and listen about how the demonic, the satanic was to be rejected, to be shunned, to be hated. So I started talking to the only one I felt I could. I started talking to the devil.
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-4166-1 begins to tear up.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4166-1:** And eventually, after years and fucking years of being hit and being dirtied, I made a deal, you know? I made a deal to make it fucking stop. I made a deal to make him pay. To make him burn like I did, to //feel// like how he made me. But that was for a price, of course. I made the deal in exchange for having to seduce and sleep with a dude once a week. But I was, pardon my French, a fucking slut back then. Fucking //horrible//. Christ. Christ. So, so I didn&#39;t care. It was a fucking //upside// to me. God. God. Christ. Forgive me.
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-4166-1 clutches its temple with both hands, pressing into its eyes with its palms.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4166-1:** For the first time in my fucking life I felt powerful. I felt in control. I got the power to kill him and I didn&#39;t even fucking do that right. I should&#39;ve known demons don&#39;t die so easily.
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-4166-2 manifests.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4166-1:** I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m so sorry. I&#39;m sorry for--
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-4166-2 begins approaching SCP-4166-1. Emergency containment protocol ECP-166 initiated.]// --losing it. I should&#39;ve been better than that. I have to be. I&#39;d like to, I&#39;d like to stop for today.
