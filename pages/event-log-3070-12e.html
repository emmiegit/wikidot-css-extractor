&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** A settlement of approximately 5,000 [[[SCP-2511|SCP-2511-A instances]]] is sighted in orbit of the minor planet. SCP-2511-A instances sighted on 29514 Karatsu appear to be alive, and seemingly require no apparatus to survive in a vacuum environment. Each instance appears to have a tumorous growth on a limb, which resembles growths found on SCP-3070-1.
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** Inspection of the Matsuura River in Karatsu City, Saga Prefecture, Japan indicates the disappearance of all SCP-2511-A instances in the river. No cause identified. 
&gt; 
&gt; In order to acquire a SCP-2511-A instance who reside in orbit of 29514 Karatsu, population control of SCP-2511-A instances is currently under consideration.

&gt; **Description:** A steel bust (1.2m tall) of Albert Einstein depicted with protruding tongue, manifested on the asteroid&#39;s surface. Microwave emissions (251 MHz) are intermittently released from the cranial region, which appear to be transmissions encoded in octal.[[footnote]]The base-8 number system.[[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** Monitoring of emissions over a ██ month period has yielded a text fragment: &#34;could get some wind for the sailboat. These are&#34;. Monitoring is continuing.

&gt; **Minor Planet:** 3552 Don Quixote
&gt; **3070-A Discovery Date:** 15-April-20██
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** Towers of damaged automobiles (~30m tall) were found at irregular points on the surface. A group of cybernetic humanoid entities, each wearing armor resembling medieval jousting suits, were slowly deconstructing the towers and using gathered materials to construct non-functioning automobiles.
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** The SCP-3070-A instances are believed to have a connection to Donald K. Cervantes, an owner of a scrap metal business specializing in cars in Portland, Maine. Interrogation with Cervantes has revealed no relation to SCP-3070 or other known anomalies, though he has several relatives working in the IAU.

&gt; **Minor Planet:** 42042
&gt; **3070-A Discovery Date:** 4-February-20██
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** The corpse of an adult //Physeter macrocephalus//[[footnote]]Sperm whale.[[/footnote]] was sighted on the surface of the planetoid. Injuries consistent with high altitude impact.
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** Upon closer observation, several earthenware fragments and a small amount of soil was found near the corpse, alongside a dead plant resembling //Petunia x atkinsiana//.

&gt; **Minor Planet:** 314612
&gt;
&gt; **3070-A Discovery Date:** 11-November-20██
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** The asteroid possesses a visual appearance resembling heavily compressed JPEG image files, with changes in the compression artifacts occurring based on the angle it is viewed at. Studies of the surface show that the topography is unchanged and that the compression is non-corporeal. An investigation to determine if this is a cognitohazardous phenomenon is underway.
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** The Google Chromium browser on the SCP-3070-1&#39;s 2018 Macbook Pro was seen to be open, with multiple tabs showing [[[SCP-2721|SCP-2721-LYRE]]]&#39;s Tumblr blog.

&gt; **Minor Planet:** 15907 Robot
&gt; 
&gt; **3070-A Discovery Date:** 01-June-20██
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** A row of four crudely constructed humanoid mechanisms, standing and manipulating what appear to be keyboard musical instruments. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** Each figure is connected by cable to an underground chamber. Readings suggest the chamber is an electricity production facility.

&gt; **Minor Planet:** 90377 Sedna
&gt;
&gt; **3070-A Discovery Date:** 6-May-20██
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** A 473 km object rose from the surface of 90377 Sedna.[[footnote]] The observation was made using experimental technology, originally used in the [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3200 Peregrine-9 Expedition].[[/footnote]] The object resembled a standard phonograph, and began making spastic movement upon surfacing entirely.
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** On 7-May-20██, the object emitted a blue light, before disappearing instantaneously. A radio transmission was later received. It read:
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; {{THANKS FOR THE LIFT. [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3200 CALAMITY] WILL BE COMING SOON. COVER YOUR ASSES.}}
&gt; 
&gt; During this time text on SCP-3070-1&#39;s 2018 Macbook Pro displayed the following text:
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 2176782336WELCOME2985984expandsednaINITIATE
&gt; 
&gt; After this the normal text displayed prior to an SCP-3070-A discovery was shown on the device. 24 biomechanical structures resembling M198 Howitzers combined with //Monodon monoceros//[[footnote]]Narwhal.[[/footnote]] cadavers were observed on the surface of the dwarf planet an hour later.

&gt; 
&gt; **3070-A Discovery Date:** 05-May-20██
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** A gradually expanding structure resembling the inside of a reading library, currently 12x8x10km, comprising shelves, stairways and study tables. Upwards of 1000 figures dressed in overalls continually consult the books, while handwriting new ones which upon completion are added to the shelves.
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** New storage space, writing materials etc. are added as needed, expanding the structure by an estimated 1 meter per earth year. //See 29829 Engels.//

&gt; **Minor Planet:** 29829 Engels
&gt; 
&gt; **3070-A Discovery Date:** 05-August-20██
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** A 19th century-style factory, of varying layout but always with three continuously smoking chimneys. Note that the asteroid has no atmosphere, nor easily combustable material. Products include sheets of paper, quill pens, pots of ink, ladders, and wooden shelving in kit form. These dematerialise at irregular intervals.

&gt; **Minor Planet:** 26858 Misterrogers
&gt; **3070-A Discovery Date:** 20-April-20██
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** Approximately 300 PCC trolley cars, resembling those used by the Pittsburgh Railways during the 1940s, were orbiting the planet.  Each car was &#34;wearing&#34; a large red cardigan sweater.  Members of OTF ञ-12 reported hearing bells during retrieval.
