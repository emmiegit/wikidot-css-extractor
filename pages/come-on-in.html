Care for a drink? Smoke? No? All right. Mind if I smoke?

[[module ListUsers users=&#34;.&#34;]] 
So to what do I owe the pleasure, %%title%%?
[[/module]]

My work with the Library? Well, I recovered [[[adventures-of-lady-del-rio-i|this]]] from the Merchants and returned it to its proper place. Not too long after, I was able to recover some [[[all astronauts go to heaven|curious info on the fate of the Opportunity Rover]]] and donated it to the Library. And I&#39;ve been helping to [[[adventures-of-lady-del-rio-ii|restore this manuscript]]] in my efforts to write Lady Juanita Del Rio&#39;s biography.

What&#39;s that?

Oh, more about me as a person? That&#39;s... strange.

Well, if you insist.

I got my start in all this paranormal nonsense -- of course it&#39;s nonsense! An infinite library overseen by a serpent the size of a solar system? Shadow paragovernmental agencies who kidnap people because they possess extranormal traits? Machine worshippers trying to resurrect their clockwork god? If you ask me, it&#39;s all a bunch of poorly-written hogwash held together with twine and dreams. It&#39;s like the X-Files, Stargate, and Harry fuckin Potter franchises tried to raise /x/&#39;s abandoned baby after finding it in the gutter. It&#39;s weird. But it&#39;s my life so what the hell can I do about it?

Anyway, like I was saying, I got my start in all this back in high school. I found out about this strange, beautiful, wonderful corner of the world and it enraptured me. Pulled me in. [http://www.scp-wiki.net/let-s-go-again-shall-we I did some odd jobs for the Jailors for a while.] [http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/agent-macleod Still do, sometimes.] But other things came up. Got in the way. I found the quiet splendor of the Library a bit more appealing to my tastes. So I think I&#39;ll continue my work here, for the time being.

Anything else you need? Feel free to ask, now&#39;s the time.</textarea></pre>
