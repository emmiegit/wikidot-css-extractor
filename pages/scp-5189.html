**ITEM #:** SCP-5189

**OBJECT CLASS:** Keter

**SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:** It is currently unknown how much of SCP-5189 is present within the ocean. An offshoot of MTF Gamma-6 (&#34;Deep Feeders&#34;), MTF Gamma-6a, is actively searching the ocean for new cases of SCP-5189 to be contained.

In most instances, SCP-5189 can be transplanted to the nearest available aquatic facility with only minor casualties. However, in the case of an SCP-5189-1 infestation, the area must be cordoned off at an area of --60-- 80 meters from the nearest instance of SCP-5189 and --elimination procedures are to take place-- left undisturbed until further notice[[footnote]] Testing is currently taking place as to ascertain an effective method of eliminating instances of SCP-5189-1 or reducing the amount of SCP-5189 to manageable levels[[/footnote]].

[[include component:image-block name=Kelp1 | caption=Instances of SCP-5189 forming SCP-5189-1.]]

**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-5189 is the designation for anomalous variations of organisms of the order Laminariales[[footnote]] Kelp[[/footnote]]. Specimens of SCP-5189 are physically identical to their respective species except for the occurrence of a mouth-like structure at the holdfast[[footnote]] The base, or &#34;roots,&#34; of the algae[[/footnote]] of each organism. This mouth is made of organic algae matter as well as dentin, formed through an unknown process, to create numerous teeth similar in size and shape to //Galeocerdo cuvier//, known as the tiger shark.

Instances of SCP-5189, at times when humans are within an area of about 80 meters, will whisper words to beckon humans to come near. Specimens of SCP-5189 do not possess vocal cords, but their voices are frequently described as &#34;female,&#34; &#34;pleasant,&#34; and &#34;alluring.&#34; The voice of each instance of SCP-5189 is unique, but always asks for the individual to come nearer. Instances of SCP-5189 do not respond to other individuals, whether human or nearby instance of SCP-5189.

Once a human is within range, instances of SCP-5189 will move their thalli and blades in order to grab onto the person. Specimens of SCP-5189 have a remarkable grip, making it unlikely for a human to escape after being grabbed on to. Once attached to a human, instances of SCP-5189 will pull the person towards their mouth and begin the consumption process.

Consumption occurs at a slow rate for specimens of SCP-5189, being approximately one bite each half-hour. Because no organs are attached to their mouths, the victimâ€™s flesh and viscera, once chewed, floats out of the mouth and into the surrounding water. This results in a frequent red coloring of the water around instances of SCP-5189. Instances of SCP-5189 will hold their victim until the consumption process is finished, with the process usually taking one or two days for a human to be completely eaten. Living bodies are held above water, while deceased ones are left below. Thus, it is common to see hanging, half-eaten bodies on instances of SCP-5189 at any given time, with a surviving victim held on the surface to bleed out.

Specimens of SCP-5189 can and will hold on to multiple people at a time, leaving their bodies floating underwater being held by the thallus. Instances of SCP-5189 show no discernment between bodies when taking bites, leaving the partially-eaten bodies hanging until all are finished.

Instances of SCP-5189 will grow together like their anomalous counterparts. Once a group of SCP-5189 has exceeded 50 specimens within 100 meters, it is an instance of SCP-5189-1. Instances of SCP-5189 in SCP-5189-1 will rip apart bodies held by other instances of SCP-5189, usually resulting in the body being split between four to six specimens.

[[include component:image-block name=Kelp2 | caption=Another instance of SCP-5189-1.]]

**INCIDENT 5189-1:** On 01/15/21, MTF Gamma-6a was dispatched to eliminate the first recorded instance of SCP-5189-1, located off the southern California coast. Utilizing procedures previously used to eliminate smaller gatherings of SCP-5189, MTF Gamma-6a proceeded to reduce the population size.

Approximately two hours into the process, MTF Gamma-6a was eliminated by SCP-5189-1. Instances of SCP-5189 appeared to work together in order to subdue and drown the task force, and split the bodies evenly throughout the instance of SCP-5189-1.

After two hours, G6a-Cap was promptly disemboweled after the rest of the team could not wrest him free from an SCP-5189 thallus. This resulted in much of the force being close enough for other instances of SCP-5189 to reach them. The rest of the force was eliminated after the range of SCP-5189-1 was proven to be larger than anticipated. The heads of G6a-8, 13, and 31 were all bitten off, the teeth being sharp enough to pierce the skull and lacerate the brain. G6a-3, 14, 18, 24 and 29 all died of blood loss within half an hour of multiple major arteries being torn open. G6a-2, 5, 8, 11, 21 and 22 were torn apart between multiple instances of SCP-5189 and died almost immediately. All other members of MTF Gamma-6a died or are are dying[[footnote]] Report was written a day after the incident.[[/footnote]] much slower due multiple nonfatal wounds.

**UPDATE:** As of 01/23/21, while many body parts have been recovered, there are still numerous bodies hanging from instances of SCP-5189.
