&gt; ++ WANTED: GROUP OF INTEREST
&gt; 
&gt; A hero is only as good as the villain. 
&gt; 
&gt; The SCP Foundation is looking for prospective Groups of Interest, which can attempt to oppose the SCP Foundation and emphasise the obvious superiority of the SCP Foundation.
&gt; 
&gt; Interviews will be conducted on ██/██/████ at Dr. Clef&#39;s office. Interview date is protected by a memetic seal that can only be bypassed by specific beings. If the interview date is visible to you, you really should participate in the interview. 
&gt; 
&gt; ,,There will be free drinks.,,

-----
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** So, you sell video games.
&gt; 
&gt; **Nolan Bushnell:** //Evil// video games.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Right.  And these games, they hurt or kill their players?
&gt; 
&gt; **Nolan Bushnell:** Or drive them insane, or something, yeah.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Isn&#39;t killing your customers kind of a bad business model?
&gt; 
&gt; **Nolan Bushnell:** [shrugs] It makes more sense when you&#39;re high.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** I should hope so.

------

&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Who are you again?
&gt; 
&gt; **ASCI Director:** The American Secure Containment Initiative. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** You can&#39;t just take two out of our three slogans like that.
&gt; 
&gt; **ASCI Director:** You&#39;re the ones who took our title. We&#39;re your predecessor, one of them at least.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** If you&#39;re gonna become us, why are you here? 
&gt; 
&gt; **ASCI Director:** Apparently, predecessors are still classified as minor GoIs. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Buddy, didn&#39;t you see the job ad? We&#39;re looking for villains. If you will become us in the future, you can&#39;t be the villains. That will make us, the heroes, look bad.
&gt; 
&gt; **ASCI Director:** I can at least join the winning side, right? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** ... I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re mistaken, friend. You will never join the winning side. You&#39;re just a stale reductionist representative. Folks like me are forever the winning side, but we always find use for lackeys and cannon fodder. [smiles]

------

&gt; **Dr. Clef:** So, you&#39;re the daughter of one of our Staffs who had gained multiversal knowledge?
&gt; 
&gt; **The Black Queen:** Huh, I will not say it like that, but basically, yes...
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** In that case, I don&#39;t know what sort of villain you can be. I mean, right now, I can only imagine you as a rip-off of this weird caterpillar in //Alice in Wonderland//.
&gt; 
&gt; **The Black Queen:** Wait! My goal is to destroy the Foundation AND I&#39;m not alone, me and my Sisters share the same goal.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Listen, I don&#39;t think that little kids are the best opponents...
&gt; 
&gt; //Dr. Clef is interrupted by the sudden entrance of 380 other Black Queens. Some of them look exhausted and some others apologize for being late.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef, muttering to himself:** Okay... what is the moment when this interview turned into a //World War Z// remake?

------

&gt; **The guy you ate lunch with:** //hello//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** I&#39;m sorry, who are you?
&gt; 
&gt; **The girl who sat behind you:** Don&#39;t you remember?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Don&#39;t think so.
&gt; 
&gt; **Your best friend:** We went to school together!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Uh, I was homeschooled.
&gt; 
&gt; **The first girl you kissed:**  What about the road trip?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** What road trip?  I hate driving.
&gt; 
&gt; **That guy you used to smoke weed with:** You know, in the summer of &#39;76.  After we graduated.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** I was, like, 10 years old.  Are you sure you came to the right interview?
&gt; 
&gt; **[[span style=&#34;color:black; background-color: black&#34;]]Youdonotrecognizethebodiesinthewater[[/span]]:** You seriously don&#39;t recognize me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Nope.
&gt; 
&gt; **One of the band geeks:** Ah, forget this.
&gt; 
&gt; [All your friends leave you behind.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Looks like somebody peaked in high school.

------

&gt; //An interdimensional portal openes and an ancient daevite beast steps out.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Take a seat.
&gt; 
&gt; **Daevite:** //Eldritch screeching//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Fuck this.
------

&gt; [Dr. Clef notices a large rectangular envelope that has been on his desk this entire time.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Huh? What&#39;s this?
&gt; 
&gt; [Dr. Clef opens the envelope, revealing a large brass plaque.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** &#34;Department of Abnormalities?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Dr. Clef inspects the envelope and the reverse side of the plaque for any further information, but finds none.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Huh.
&gt; 
&gt; [Dr. Clef shrugs and tosses the plaque into the waste bin beside his desk.]

-----

&gt; **Robo-Dude:** I AM ROBO-DUDE, A INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF DR. WONDERTAINMENT. I AM HERE TO COLLECT THE FREE DRINKS, ROBO-PAL.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Why? You are a robot.
&gt; 
&gt; **Robo-Dude:** NOT FOR ME BUT DR. WONDERTAINMENT. I AM HERE TO COLLECT THE FREE DRINKS FOR DR. WONDERTAINMENT.
&gt; 
&gt;  **Dr. Clef:** Why don&#39;t he come and get them himself?
&gt; 
&gt; **Robo-Dude:** DO NOT INTIMIDATE ROBO-DUDE. DR. WONDERTAINMENT IS A BUSY TOY MAKER  AND THIS VERSION OF ROBO-DUDE COMES EQUIPPED WITH AN ATOMIC GRENADE IN THE EVENT YOU FAIL TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE PROMISED FREE DRINKS.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Kinda extreme for a toy... Kids these days are so lucky. Anyway, the drinks are at that table next to the bowl of chips, which is mine so no touching that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Robo-Dude:** THANK YOU, ROBO-PAL.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** You know Dr. Wondertainment should pay an actual visit next time. They could make-
&gt; 
&gt; [Robo-Dude grabs all the drinks and vanishes in a bright blue light]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Did he really just take //all// the damn soda?

----

&gt; **Dr. Clef:** So that&#39;s your entire mission? Finding a grave for Genghis Khan?
&gt; 
&gt; **Berke Khan:** He asked for an unmarked grave, and that is what he shall receive!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** So what, you&#39;re searching through time for an unmarked grave?
&gt; 
&gt; **Berke Khan:** Precisely! We shall travel until we find a time when nobody remembers Genghis Khan, and then we shall return to the past to continue our campaigns, with the spoils of the future!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** But you&#39;re only going forward in time?
&gt; 
&gt; **Berke Khan:** Always forward!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** So really, all we need to do is fund a couple of low budget movies and books every so often, and keep good records on the most deadly conqueror in the history of mankind? We don&#39;t even have to be accurate, we could even whitewash Genghis.
&gt; 
&gt; **Berke Khan:** What&#39;s a movie?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Look, I know who your father is.
&gt; 
&gt; **Berke Khan:** No! I must continue my travels.
&gt; 
&gt; //Berke Khan uses his Roman time machine to travel into the future.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Nobody had ever heard of Genghis Khan in 1160. Just saying.

------

&gt; **Dr. Clef:** So, bottom line, you&#39;re a circus?
&gt; 
&gt; **Herman Fuller:** Not just any circus, my good man. Herman Fuller&#39;s Circus of the Disquieting is //The// Circus, the Greatest Show in all the Worlds! Surely you&#39;ve heard of us.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** …
&gt; 
&gt; **Herman Fuller:** You&#39;re joking.
&gt; 
&gt;  **Dr. Clef:** Well, I remember there were a few good scips about you a few years ago, then there was almost nothing until last year when we started getting all these weird stories coming in for some reason.
&gt; 
&gt; **Herman Fuller:** That&#39;s right, we&#39;ve got a cannon now!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** A canon?
&gt; 
&gt; **Herman Fuller:** That&#39;s right, Alty, a 90-foot-long cannon: solid cast iron, fires balls three feet wide, and is accurate to within 3 miles. Don&#39;t tell me that doesn&#39;t make us a formidable enemy!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Look, Mr. Fuller, every time we try to raid your Circus you just vanish into thin air. We&#39;re looking for an enemy that&#39;s a little more… menacing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Herman Fuller:** More menacing? More menacing? Sir, you show me one six-year-old in the world who isn&#39;t afraid of Clowns and then say we&#39;re not menacing!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** We don&#39;t employ six-year-olds, so that&#39;s a moot point. Hey, come to think of it, last I read you weren&#39;t even still in charge of the Circus of the Disquieting.
&gt; 
&gt; **Herman Fuller:** I assure you, sir, I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** In fact, you&#39;re supposed to be in containment. You&#39;re a mediocrely rated [[[SCP-3440 |SCP]]]  now.
&gt; 
&gt;  **Herman Fuller:** I have had enough of these preposterous accusations! Good day sir!
&gt; 
&gt;  **Dr. Clef:** Don&#39;t get your strings caught in the door on your way out, Pinocchio.

------

&gt; **Dr. Clef:** General, weren&#39;t you guys defeated in the Pacific War?
&gt; 
&gt; **Kakure Shogun:** Yes, that happened. Circumstances beyond IJAMEA&#39;s control, to be precise. But we have survived the war, and infiltrated almost all segments of society.  
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Standard secret organisation, eh?
&gt; 
&gt; **Kakure Shogun:** We have factions like the Kakure Shogun and Jirai. In English, they are &#39;hidden generals&#39; and &#39;landmine&#39; respectively. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** General, look. We already have ORIA and GRU-P for our obligatory foreign organisation GoI. Three&#39;s a crowd. And yellow peril&#39;s so dead. Your group has absolutely no appeal at all. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Kakure Shogun:** Doctor, I will not tolerate Orientalism. This is about the sacrifices of many people who died at war. Can you just let people die for nothing?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Speaking of dying, we beat your entire group. And that&#39;s your place, buddy. [snaps finger]
&gt; 
&gt; [Kakure Shogun is replaced with a human skeleton, which quickly crumbles to dust.]

-----

&gt; **##red|The man whose face cannot be photographed##:**  So, what&#39;s your group called?
&gt; 
&gt; **##blue|A being with the head of a rabbit##:**  We don&#39;t have a name, unfortunately.
&gt; 
&gt; **##red|The scientist who smiles widely and wears a big hat##:**  What?  why not?
&gt; 
&gt; **##blue|The leporine visitor##:**  Our names were taken from us long ago.  Now we seek to reclaim them.
&gt; 
&gt; **##red|The doctor who sticks unrolled cinnamon twists in his nose##:**  Taken?  How&#39;s that supposed to work?
&gt; 
&gt; **##blue|The fur-covered stranger##:**  A great magical working.  We aided your organization in a war against a terrible foe, but then you betrayed us, banished us to another realm, and stole our names to keep us from returning.
&gt; 
&gt; **##red|The interviewer with the long nose##:**  Oh, so you want revenge?
&gt; 
&gt; **##blue|The long-eared one##:**  Hardly!  We only wish to reclaim our names, so that we might return home.
&gt; 
&gt; **##red|The being who carries a ukelele##:**  Oh.  Can&#39;t you just...make up new ones?
&gt; 
&gt; **##blue|Some rabbit guy##:**  What?
&gt; 
&gt; **##red|The dude that all women find repulsive##:**  You know, make up a fake name.  It&#39;s not that hard.
&gt; 
&gt; **##blue|A furry fairy##:**  ...
&gt; 
&gt; **##red|The person who lies often##:**  Well?
&gt; 
&gt; **John Smith:**  ...you know what, never mind.
&gt; 
&gt; [John Smith gets up to leave.]
&gt; 
&gt; **##red|A somewhat confused researcher##:**  Um, okay.
------

&gt; [Dr. Clef stares blankly at the empty chair in his office, nodding his head.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** I see you are truly Nobody. I think we can fit you in whenever we feel like it. Next!

------

&gt; **Dr Clef:** And... you represent? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Generic Waffen-SS Commander:** I am here on behalf of ze Obskurakorps of ze Third Reich. Hei- [He is cut short by a bullet to the head.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Clef:** Yeah, no. Fuck Nazis.

&gt; 
&gt; **???:**  [[span class=&#34;dblock&#34;]]This is why I hate you.[[/span]]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Clef:** What a shame.

------

&gt; **Dr. Clef:** So uh... What was the name of your group again?
&gt; 
&gt; **Richard Dawkins:** We are the most esteemed guardians of truth and reason, the Society of the Atheist Partisans of-
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Alright you can stop there. We&#39;ll work on shortening that name later. Or at the very least come up with a cool backronym. Tell me more about your whole militant atheist schtick.
&gt; 
&gt; **Richard Dawkins:** What&#39;s there to explain? We use our superior intellectual prowess to rightfully disprove the frankly moronic notions of religion and the supernatural.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Uh huh, and how does that work in a setting where those things are more or less self-evident for important guys like us?
&gt; 
&gt; **Richard Dawkins:** Don&#39;t be daft! Your so-called &#34;anomalies&#34; are all but mere hoaxes. All of them.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** We&#39;ve got what&#39;s basically a Weeping Angel locked up. How do you explain that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Richard Dawkins:** I... Er-well-
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** And don&#39;t your guys use anomalies sometimes?
&gt; 
&gt; **Richard Dawkins:** I-I&#39;m afraid I have to take my leave. I promised ZICRON Seamus I&#39;d go fedora shopping with him.
&gt; 
&gt; [Mr. Dawkins sprints out of Dr. Clef&#39;s office.]

------

&gt; **Grand Karcist Ion:** Pleasure to meet you, Clef. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Indeed, Grand Karcist. Please tell me more about this Sarkicism. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Grand Karcist Ion:** [visibly irritated] Firstly, I would prefer if you do not use the s-word. This is 2017. We should not be subject to such language.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** I&#39;m sorry, &#39;hon. Keep on talking. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Grand Karcist Ion:** I represent the Nälkä, an ancient religion dated back to what you would call the Bronze Age. Our faith&#39;s tenets include the shepherding of the flesh-
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Ah, that&#39;s your schtick! You can be the obligatory antagonists if we need some body horror and unspeakably ancient religion! Thank you for coming down today, Grand Karcist. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Grand Karcist Ion:** Wait! I haven&#39;t told you our deity&#39;s UST with the Broken God and our equally ancient war with the Church of the Broken God!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Clef:** That&#39;s a bit unnecessarily complicated. Besides, the focus should be the Foundation. If you&#39;re so fixated with the Church of the Broken God, why don&#39;t you go to their interview site?
&gt; 
&gt; [Grand Karcist Ion disappears from Dr. Clef&#39;s office.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Our original proposition still stands, if you&#39;re still interested!

------
&gt; 
&gt; [Dr. Clef leans forward and peers over the desk at the ██-year old █████ sitting on the other side.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Aren&#39;t you a little young to be a GoI?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-231-7:** Oh, I&#39;m not the GoI.  I&#39;m here on behalf of the Scarlet King, also known as blackbox-blackbox-blackbox-blackbox, the Devourer of Worlds.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** He sent a ██-year-old to do his bidding?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-231-7:** Well, we are called the //Children// of the Scarlet King.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Fair point, but I still think I ought to interview the guy in charge if he&#39;s gonna be a GoI.
&gt; 
&gt;  **SCP-231-7:** No can do.  The Scarlet King is currently imprisoned, bound in an extradimensional prison by seven chains.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Isn&#39;t that a little cliche?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-231-7:** Ah, but listen to this.  See, I&#39;m the chain, in a metaphysical sense.  Or, rather, my child is.
&gt; 
&gt; [Dr. Clef scrutinizes the ██-year-old █████.  She does not appear to be pregnant.]
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-231-7:** We have to wait until right before you contain us, so there can be suspense.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Ah.  And how, exactly, are you supposed to be contained?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-231-7:** Way ahead of you.  We made detailed notes.
&gt; 
&gt; [SCP-231-7 hands Dr. Clef a spiral notebook.  He opens it and is visibly surprised.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** This says we have to [DATA EXPUNGED] you every 24 hours.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-231-7:** Well, of course.  I mean, I&#39;m containing an Apollyon-class entity.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Apollyon?  What the Hell is that?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-231-7:** It&#39;s even worse than Keter!  Isn&#39;t that edgy?
&gt; 
&gt; [Disgusted, Dr. Clef hands the notebook back to SCP-231-7.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Sorry, this is the lolFoundation, not the edgyFoundation.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-231-7:** So you&#39;re not going to [DATA EXPUNGED] me?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Um, no.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-231-7:** ...not even once?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Okay, we&#39;re done here.
&gt; 
------
&gt; [There is a knock at the door. Dr. Clef goes to answer it, and finds an unmarked cardboard box.]
&gt; 
&gt; [Opening it, he finds several unidentified black rectangles, possessing no identifying markings.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** And they said I should throw this thing out.
&gt; 
&gt; [Dr. Clef inserts one of the rectangles into a currently unidentified machine sitting on a dusty bookshelf. He then powers on an unidentified screen.]
&gt; 
&gt; [A yellow logo plastered on a cyan background appears, fading to what appears to be a talk show set. An unidentified figure sits alone.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Unidentified Figure:** VK Technical Media Solutions. 
&gt; 
&gt; [The figure stands up.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Unidentified Figure:** Your life&#39;s already a joke. Why not laugh along?
&gt; 
&gt; [A stock laugh track can be heard, before Dr. Clef powers the screen down.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Clef:** Huh. Was that so hard?
&gt; 
------

&gt; [The representative from the Shark Punching Centre opens the door to the interview room and walks in. However, he is blocked by a solid brick wall. On the wall, the following is inscribed: &#34;No. We may be lolFoundation, but we have standards too.&#34;]
