[[div class=&#34;darkbox&#34;]]
The Foundation&#39;s mission is to Secure, Contain, and Protect the anomalous. However, this is a pretty vast goal, ranging from containing small, harmless cowbells to universal concepts endangering the very core of humanity. The entire Foundation cannot tackle all these anomalies at once. As such, it becomes necessary to divide and conquer, in the form of Departments.

Departments are entities within the Foundation that specialize in one specific task or discipline. They put their expertise to use in areas where others could not, ensuring that each respective field is given the care and attention it deserves.
[[/div]]

[[=]]
[[div class=&#34;lightbox&#34;]]
+++++ This is an open, collaborative project. If you discover a Department which is absent or has been improperly catalogued, feel free to add it.

[[div class=&#34;darkbox&#34;]]
+ HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

[[collapsible show=&#34;SHOW INSTRUCTIONS ◁&#34; hide=&#34;HIDE INSTRUCTIONS ▽&#34;]]
So, you wanna add to this page?

Good! There&#39;s no automatic way of updating this page, so the more people who add to it the better. That way, we have a better chance of covering everything and leaving no stone unturned! But, how does a Department qualify for addition to this page? Well,

* **The Department has appeared in at least one successful article.**

And that&#39;s it! Basically, if it exists on one or more articles with a rating above 0, you can add it here. Now that we know which Departments can and can&#39;t be added here, how do we actually add them in?
----
+++ Adding New Departments

First, find the category it falls under. Currently, some Departments have been haphazardly placed in one of the four categories. If we get enough Departments that don&#39;t necessarily fit into one of the categories below, an &#34;Other&#34; category will be opened for these oddballs.

Next, find where it would fit alphabetically.

Then inject this code:
[[code]]
|| [DEPARTMENT NAME] || [LINK TO AN ARTICLE IT HAS APPEARED IN] || [BITE-SIZED DESCRIPTION] || [SUBDIVISION STATUS, IF APPLICABLE] ||
[[/code]]

If the Department has a hub of its own, like the Antimemetics Division or Department of Miscommunications, embed that link in the first column. For the Subdivision column, if this Department is a part of a larger Department, put it as so. If it has subdivisions within itself, list them.

As well, there&#39;s a limit of 3 appearances per Department, so only include three links in the Appearances section. As well, if you see one that has less than three appearances and you know of another, please add it in! **The only exception to this is Departments with their own tag.** If they have a tag, just link the tag for Appearances.

If you make any changes to this page, make sure to leave a summary of them in the &#34;Short description of changes&#34; category in the edit screen!
----
+++ Special Cases

So, you got a Department that you think should be on this list, but it&#39;s not necessarily part of the Foundation. That&#39;s alright! As long as the organization it&#39;s a part of is roughly analogous to the Foundation, it can be added to this page.

For example, [[[SCP-4317]]] showcases the Department of Marketing, which is a part of the &#34;SCP Corporation.&#34; While it&#39;s not part of //our// Foundation, it is still part of //a// Foundation. You could consider the Corporation to fill a similar role as the Foundation while not being a 1:1 copy. As such, the Department of Marketing is eligible for inclusion.

A Department cannot be added if its organization is a Foundation precursor or successor. For example, [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/hmfscp#pages HMFSCP]&#39;s [[[raisa-6147 |Operations Council]]] would not be considered for this list, as in most canons HMFSCP becomes part of the Foundation. This also applies to [[[SCP-4163]]]&#39;s Federation Records Department, as the SCP Federation is a direct result of the SCP Foundation.

Finally, before anyone asks, **Groups of Interests considered to be alternative Foundations are not allowed.** That means no Selachian Pugilist Centre. Sorry, CICAPOCO, not today. Likewise, this also applies to the Chaos Insurgency and their Delta Command.
