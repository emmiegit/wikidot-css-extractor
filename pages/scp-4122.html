**Item #:** SCP-4122

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4122 is to be stored in a standard locked safe-deposit box. Access is restricted, requiring written permission from two Level 4 personnel. 

Testing with SCP-4122 is prohibited.

**Description:** SCP-4122 is a section of PVC pipe, 9 cm in diameter and 17 cm long. An arrow is drawn on the side of the object in black permanent marker. 

Housed within SCP-4122 is a temporal anomaly that shifts objects passing through it 1 second into the future or past, depending on the direction of travel. Objects passing through in the direction of the arrow (hereafter &#34;the forward direction&#34;) travel into the future, while objects passing in the opposite direction (hereafter &#34;the backward direction&#34;) travel into the past.

SCP-4122 was recovered from the possession of Michael Swanson, a tradesman who had been using the object to duplicate currency. Swanson claimed to have retrieved SCP-4122 from a house in the suburbs of Brisbane, Australia after being hired to perform maintenance work on the building&#39;s stormwater system. Foundation efforts to locate the house have been unsuccessful, and the address provided by Swanson prior to being amnesticised lead to an undeveloped estate.

**Addendum A: SCP-4122 Testing Log**
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Expand Testing Log&#34; hide=&#34;- Collapse Testing Log&#34;]]

**Date:** 05-11-████
**Presiding:** Level 3 Senior Researcher Dr. Andreas Weir
**Assisting:** Level 2 Research Assistant May Schumacher

//Redundant tests redacted for brevity//

&gt; __**Test 1**__ 
&gt; **Apparatus:** Red plastic ping pong ball, 40 mm diameter.
&gt; **Procedure:** Ball was dropped through SCP-4122 in the forward direction. 
&gt; **Results:** Ball vanished from sight for 1 second upon passing through SCP-4122 before emerging and continuing along previous trajectory. Slow motion recording shows the ball disappearing smoothly as it passes an invisible plane near the midpoint of SCP-4122. 

&gt; __**Test 2**__ 
&gt; **Apparatus:** 30 cm steel ruler.
&gt; **Procedure:** Ruler was pushed through SCP-4122 in the forward direction.
&gt; **Results:** Tip of ruler emerged 1 second after passing through SCP-4122&#39;s event horizon. Any motions made with the ruler were repeated by the ruler tip 1 second later.

&gt; __**Test 7**__ 
&gt; **Apparatus:** Red plastic ball.
&gt; **Procedure:** Ball was dropped through SCP-4122 in the backward direction. 
&gt; **Result:** 0.75 seconds prior to being dropped, and 1 second prior to entering SCP-4122&#39;s event horizon, a duplicate instance of the ping-pong ball emerged from SCP-4122. The original instance vanished upon entering SCP-4122&#39;s event horizon, leaving only the duplicate.

&gt; __**Test 8**__ 
&gt; **Apparatus:** Red plastic ball.
&gt; **Procedure:** Research Assistant Schumacher was instructed to drop ball through SCP-4122, but stop when a duplicate emerged.
&gt; **Result:** Approximately 0.75 seconds before the ball was to be dropped, a duplicate instance emerged. A high-pitched sound[[footnote]] See Addendum B - Audio Analysis Report 4122-1[[/footnote]] and brief puff of air not observed in the earlier tests were noted when the duplicate ball emerged. Comparative analysis of both instances could find no difference.
&gt; **Note:** This test confirmed the recovery team&#39;s report that the object has the ability to duplicate small items.

&gt; __**Test 15**__ 
&gt; **Apparatus:** 30 cm steel ruler.
&gt; **Procedure:** Ruler was pushed through SCP-4122 in the backward direction.
&gt; **Results:** Tip of ruler emerged 1 second prior to passing through SCP-4122&#39;s event horizon. Motions made by the ruler tip attempted to predict Research Assistant Schumacher&#39;s movements by 1 second, but showed visible discrepancies. Ruler was retrieved without incident.
&gt; **Note:**  This test appears to be inconsistent with the results of Test 8. The research team hypothesizes that there may be some manner of threshold for creating a paradox that this test did not meet. Alternatively, it may simply not work if you&#39;ve got something stuck in it.

&gt; __**Test 16**__ 
&gt; **Apparatus:** 30 cm steel ruler.
&gt; **Procedure:** Ruler was pushed through SCP-4122 in the backward direction while Research Assistant Schumacher was blindfolded.
&gt; **Results:** Tip of ruler emerged 1 second prior to passing through SCP-4122&#39;s event horizon. Motions made by the ruler tip accurately predicted all of Research Assistant Schumacher&#39;s movements.
&gt; **Note:** This test implies that the discrepancies in movements observed in the previous test were the direct result of Schumacher’s awareness of the ruler&#39;s future movements.

&gt; __**Test 19**__
&gt; **Subject:** White laboratory rat
&gt; **Procedure:** Research Assistant Schumacher was instructed to drop subject through SCP-4122, but stop when a duplicate emerges.
&gt; **Results:** Subject was successfully duplicated. SCP-4122 emitted a high pitched sound[[footnote]] See Addendum B - Audio Analysis Report 4122-4[[/footnote]] and puff of air consistent with previous tests. Comparative analysis found both instances of the subject to be identical.
&gt; **Note:** The research team concluded based on animal testing that SCP-4122 was acceptably safe, and requested authorization to perform human testing in order to retrieve tactile data.

&gt; __**Test  22**__ 
&gt; **Subject:** D-28512
&gt; **Procedure:** Subject was instructed to push right hand through SCP-4122 in the backward direction.
&gt; **Results:** Subject moved to follow instructions, but flinched and pulled his hand back when the duplicate emerged. The duplicate hand was cleanly severed at the wrist, accompanied by a high pitched sound[[footnote]] See █████████ - ███████████████ ████-█ [[/footnote]] and puff of air consistent with previous tests. Comparative analysis has identified no difference between the severed duplicate hand and the subject&#39;s actual hand beyond the results of it being detached from the subject&#39;s body.

//**Note:** Testing was postponed until the lab and equipment could be cleaned of blood.//

**Addendum B: SCP-4122 Audio Analysis Results**
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Expand Audio Analysis Results (INPUT LEVEL 3 AUTHORIZATION)&#34; hide=&#34;- Collapse Audio Analysis Results&#34;]]
**Date:** 08-11-████
**Description:** Multiple samples were provided by the research team. Each consists of approximately half a minute of audio, played at around 30x normal speed and pitched primarily in the ultrasonic range. Voices identified as those of Research Assistant Schumacher, Dr. Weir and D-28512. Transcripts are provided below.

&gt; 
&gt; **Schumacher:** &#34;It didn&#39;t come out. Wasn&#39;t it supposed to-&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Weir:** &#34;Schumacher! The walls!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Schumacher:** &#34;What? Oh &#39;kay... they’re red...&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Weir:** &#34;I noticed!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; //[A noise consisting of hundreds of plastic, popping noises can be heard increasing in volume in the background. Very distant shouting can also be made out]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Schumacher:** &#34;Uh, doctor, there are ping pong balls coming out of the walls. Is this part of the test? Should we log this?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Weir:** &#34;No, I think we should be leaving before—oh shit.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Schumacher:** &#34;Doctor? Oh my god doctor, you too? Hang on, I’m going to get you out of here.&#34; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Weir:** //[voice noticeably distorted]// &#34;This... this is really painful...&#34; 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Weir begins a string of profanity, before being cut off by choking noises. The background noise increases to a roar]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Schumacher:** &#34;Doctor Weir! Andreas, no! Don&#39;t go! Come back! Oh my god the floor&#39;s disintegrating. Oh no no no, it&#39;s pulling me down, help, please, someone help—&#34; 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Schumacher&#39;s cries for help continue for approximately 8 seconds during which the background noise continues to increase in volume before audio passes beyond discernible range]//
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Transcript&gt;**

&gt; **Schumacher:** &#34;It didn&#39;t come out. Wasn&#39;t it supposed to-&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Weir:** &#34;Schumacher! The walls!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Schumacher:** &#34;What? Oh &#39;kay... they’re furry...”
&gt; 
&gt; **Weir:** &#34;I noticed!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Schumacher:** &#34;... and they&#39;re //moving//...”
&gt; 
&gt; **Weir:** &#34;I noticed that too!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; //[A noise consisting of a combination of squeaking, hissing, chattering and plopping noises can be heard increasing in volume in the background. Very distant screaming can also be made out]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Schumacher:** &#34;Doctor, I think I&#39;d like to leave now.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Weir:** &#34;They&#39;re not just coming out of the wall, they&#39;re taking matter from the wall. This entire building is going to fall apart if—oh shit.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Schumacher:** &#34;The roof, too. Oh my god doctor, they&#39;re falling out of the roof. We&#39;re going to be buried in rats. I don&#39;t want to be buried in rats—&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Weir:** //[voice noticeably distorted]// &#34;Schumacher... it&#39;s not just... the building...&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Schumacher:** &#34;Doctor Weir? Andreas!&#34; //[scream]// &#34;Oh my god, what the hell is—no, why? Why is this happening? ... wait...&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; //[momentary pause, during which the background noise increases to a roar]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Schumacher:** //[audibly clearer, likely due to Schumacher positioning herself closer to the object]// &#34;Listen! Listen to me! Stop testing the pipe! You need to stop testing SCP-4—&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; //[Schumacher&#39;s voice is abruptly choked off as if something has blocked her mouth. This is followed by approximately 6 seconds of muffled screaming before audio passes beyond discernible range]//
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Transcript&gt;**
&gt; 

//**Note:** Testing of SCP-4122 has been discontinued indefinitely by order of O5-9.//
