Valentin woke up to the sound of Ham chittering urgently.

&#34;Hungry, eh comrade? Come on, why don&#39;t you ever bug Neil or Christa or anybody else? Let&#39;s get you some breakfast.&#34; As Valentin rose up out of bed, the chimp ran around the room, whining urgently, before running to the building&#39;s front door. &#34;Oh. You&#39;re not hungry. Something else, then. Let&#39;s see it, tovarisch.&#34;

He quickly laced up a worn pair of boots and followed the ape to the door. As he turned the knob, he heard the whining of a familiar mutt from outside.

&#34;Oh, good morning Laika. Good girl.&#34; He patted the dog&#39;s head as the dog pawed at his feet. She looked up to him and barked. &#34;Everyone&#39;s on edge this morning. All right. This better be good.&#34; He let Ham out then closed the door. The dog and the ape took a running start for what they&#39;d all come to know as the landing pad.

As he speed-walked to catch up to the excited animals, anxious thoughts started to run through Valentin&#39;s mind. //Probably no one I know. They&#39;re probably quite scared. I wonder how it happened. Maybe I should go get Kalpana or Christa, they helped Alsbury better than any of the rest of us could. But I&#39;m already up, let&#39;s go see who it is.&#34;//

Valentin reached the open field after a brisk 5-minute walk to see Laika and Ham running around a strange machine, barking and chittering respectively. &#34;Both of you, come here, leave it alone.&#34; The animals ran to his heels after he said this. As he reached it, he walked around it, looking it over, assessing it. It had a camera mast a bit over a meter and a half high, a back covered in solar panels, six wheels, and all manner of instruments. He noted a familiar red-striped standard with a blue, star-spangled canton.

&#34;So you&#39;re American, eh?&#34; The mast that housed a pair of cameras turned towards him. &#34;Oh, and you&#39;re awake! Do you have a name, //mechanismik//?&#34; The cameras followed him slowly as a mechanical voice from deep inside the device rumbled out a sound that didn&#39;t sound like anything at all. &#34;Take your time, little machine. You&#39;ve just come a very long way.&#34;

Eventually, the rover tried again. &#34;Opp... Opportunity.&#34;

Valentin smiled. &#34;I&#39;ve heard a lot about you, Opportunity. We met your sister, Spirit, some time ago. We thought we&#39;d meet you sooner. But you were a tough little probe, weren&#39;t you? Didn&#39;t want to give up. You did very well. My name is Senior Lieutenant Valentin Bondarenko, these two are Ham and Laika, this is Elysium, and you&#39;re finally home.&#34;</textarea></pre>
