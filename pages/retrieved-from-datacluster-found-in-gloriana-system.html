Captain Hulo,

I and the remainder of the thaumaturgical detachment formally request that immediate action be taken for the safety of the Mystagogue, her crew and her payload. Put simply, technicians must be spared to fix the viewport system -- at least 90 percent of the viewport shutters must be closed ASAP.

More precisely, I and my command have pinpointed an invocation that we believe will restore critical function to the ion-thaum engines. My team has most of the components required for the ritual -- I must extend my thanks to the quartermaster for the ample supply of candles and selection of livestock feathers on board, even if we went some lengths to retrieve them. There is, however, one critical component that we still require.

You are probably aware that the recent power surge has disabled the automatic shutter controls for the ship&#39;s viewports and locked the ship&#39;s internal doors in their current positions, among other things. YT%%H are also probably aware that our technicians are some of the finest the UN could supply for our voyage -- talented enough that I believe even with their current workload they could most likely repair several shipboard controls given due time.

The invocation we have in mind requires lunar thaumic energy of a high purity, a purity that we cannot achieve if the viewports are open to every natural satellite in the universe. Even if the door system wasn&#39;t frozen and we were able to shut out reflections on the visible light and thaumaturgic spectrums from the rest of the ship, there are still too many viewports in the labs -- and even if stripping our uniforms were enough to block the viewports, we lack the adhesive and manpower to hold them up to the bulkheads.

The portal to Gloriana IV is somewhat tenuous, I will admit, but I&#39;ve confirmed it is stable enough for our purposes -- and the essence we have from Hyphis is suitably protected by the planet&#39;s atmosphere. This, at least, is one beneficial result of our engine problems.

To summarize our desire, sir, we require technicians to address our problems, and soon -- as I firmly believe they are of __critical importance__ to our situation.

Captain, despite any misgivings you may have -- and I know you are more sympathetic to the scientists on board -- I must **strongly urge** you to accept our request. You know full well that I am absolutely committed to this expedition, and to the goals set out in UN Resolution 5938. I realize that the Lunar Purity theory is not as developed as some other hypotheses concerning interplanetary thaumaturgy, but I myself place enough faith in it that I will accept any punishment or court martial that may arise as a result of its failure in our invocation.


Signed,

Lieutenant Julianne Cuevas
Executive Officer
Special Thaumaturgic Detachment, US Navy

Lieutenant,

Request denied. Our remaining techs are occupied for the foreseeable future just keeping this ship from imploding. //I&#39;m// occupied for the foreseeable future, for that matter, but I figure if I just start ignoring messages from my top magician things will only get that much worse.

I suppose I can&#39;t blame you and yours for not wanting to leave D section to find that out, given the situation with the artificers. As it stands, Ryouta is lucky to be alive after his little mishap in the cargo bay. I still can&#39;t see myself ordering enough people away from critical areas to fulfill your request.

Speaking of which. I know you knew I don&#39;t put much stock in lunar purity theory, but that doesn&#39;t change anything. I also know you know that I don&#39;t have //quite// as many degrees as you do, but there&#39;s a bit more to it than that.

If someone invents a theory based on millennia-old Earth tradition, and is significantly more of a mentally ill drug addict than the average Navcad warlock, I tend to take them with a //large grain// of salt. Perhaps my inborn officers&#39; skepticism helps with that. Hope you understand.

All that said, I don&#39;t actually have a problem with what you need done. I just cannot give it to you under these circumstances. I hate to say this, but I&#39;ve been frank this entire time so I might as well. If you absolutely must close shutters, I&#39;m pretty certain there are enough exosuits and aircyclers still in storage to outfit most of your team. Someone should probably stay in your section anyway just to keep James out if the medics run out of happy pills.

I&#39;m leaving you an FX9S and 3 cells on my aide&#39;s desk to take care of any artificers that might be in the way, if you decide to swing by. He probably won&#39;t mind anymore. And believe me, I&#39;m kicking myself in the ass every minute I still live for letting the %%TTJT%re function over%%NGUBRFFFFFhis expediti%%%%%%FFD5


//Joseph G. Hulo, Captain//
//Commanding Officer//
//UNEXF Mystagogue//

Dieter, hope to G-d you can still read this. We decided to make a run for the pods, starting 5 minutes from now. Should be enough left for all of us, assuming your group can get here fast enough. Haven&#39;t heard from the captain in two days. I don&#39;t even know if his quarters are attached to the ship anymore. %%HHGably want us to do this so I&#39;m not worried. About his response I mean. Core reactions are getting even worse so be careful whatever you do, and I probably don&#39;t need to tell you to forget about any of those artifac%%GGDG%athered. I will pray for you.
