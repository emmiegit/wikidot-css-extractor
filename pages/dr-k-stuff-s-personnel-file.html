Oh hey, there&#39;s nothing here?

Yeah so this page has said it&#39;s gonna be going through massive revisions for... ohh I think literal years! But now I am actually acting on this promise, and you can expect something different to go here soon!

No, not yet.

Yea, hopefully this announcement doesn&#39;t stay up for //years// either.

Anyways in the meantime here&#39;s a module showing everything I&#39;ve written!

[[collapsible show=&#34;It&#39;s kind of big, so I put it under a collapsible.&#34; hide=&#34;Though I suppose that&#39;s the entire point of this page and it&#39;s rather empty otherwise, so maybe I shouldn&#39;t care?&#34;]]

[[include :scp-wiki:component:author-page
      order=created_at |
      perpage=100 |
      background=yes |
      image=yes |
      sortbar=yes |
    ]]

Oh and as a bonus I guess I&#39;m gonna record some lyrics here that I have choked up to. I wanted to start collecting them and didn&#39;t know where to put this list, so for now it goes here, and you can look at it too!

[[=]]
&#34;And in my dreams, you&#39;re alive and you&#39;re crying
As your mouth moves in mine, soft and sweet
Rings of flowers &#39;round your eyes and I love you
For the rest of my life in my sleep&#34;[[footnote]]This was shortly after my family dog, Sasha, died, and I was delivering a Domino&#39;s pizza, listening to my music on shuffle. This came on and this line took me out for a bit. Love you, Sasha. 2010-2022.[[/footnote]]

&#34;&#39;Can I tell someone the things I&#39;ve learned?
Can I tell someone the things I&#39;ve learned?&#39;
&#39;I&#39;m sorry, friend, that&#39;s none of my concern
It&#39;s time, it&#39;s time to go&#39;&#34;[[footnote]]This one&#39;s pretty recent. Yes, the lyric is actually &#34;can I tell //Solomon// the things I&#39;ve learned,&#34; but when it choked me up I had misheard it. (I did the same to the Neutral Milk Hotel lyrics above.) More than the fear of death, and more than wanting to say goodbye, something about the inability to share what you&#39;ve learned before you die fills me with a deep sadness.[[/footnote]]

&#34;They&#39;ve been ignoring every word I speak
Each sentence torn by fibers, they think that I&#39;m a freak
When will this nightmare end?&#34;[[footnote]]This one absolutely blindsided me, I&#39;d heard this song before (same with almost all songs in hear that I choked up to, the choking typically didn&#39;t happen on first listen) and this song isn&#39;t the slow, sad type that usually get to me. But I dunno, something in the moment really struck with the &#39;//when will this nightmare end?//&#39;, struck hard enough I had to reel for a moment and go: &#34;Woah buddy, uh, are we okay, are we in a good place? Do I really think of my current circumstance as a &#39;nightmare?&#39;&#34; (No, I don&#39;t, what resonates can be an exaggeration of a circumstance.)[[/footnote]]

&#34;And all the trust we put in things
In dictionaries, in engineering
In calendars, and television
And father&#39;s friends, and consequences&#34;[[footnote]]Honestly when this song gets me it&#39;s really the whole song that does it (well, the whole sung bit, the long instrumental is also good but different), but Sufjan&#39;s beautiful voice softly gracing the high notes when he sings &#34;all the trust we put in things&#34; fucking does me in. He has such a pretty voice. If I was an evil wizard I would steal Sufjan&#39;s voice for myself.[[/footnote]]
