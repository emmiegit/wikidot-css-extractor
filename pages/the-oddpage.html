Greetings, mortals. I am [[*user BitOddInnit]] and I am here to --consume your souls-- --supercede God and remake the universe in my own image-- write shit for the wiki. I mainly write for the NIGHTFALL Canon, since that&#39;s my current unhealthy obbession. I&#39;m willing to write for other things if they pique my interest, though.

+ BEHOLD! MY STUFF!

Sometimes the best advice comes from a blonde dude in a bag of cheese.

[[[SCP-6734|SCP-6734]]] - The Celestant Nail
Excalibur looks a lot different now that the sun&#39;s gone down forever...

[[[SCP-7221|SCP-7221]]] - It&#39;s Mime-tic (In association with [[*user Uncle Nicolini]])
A tale of a mime and the MTF tasked with containing it.

[[[SCP-7293]]] - Cast For Ursine (In association with [[*user SYTYCFanon]])

[[tab Tales]]
[[[percy|Percy]]]
A girl and her dog. What a wholesome story, surely nothing will go wrong here...
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Author Commentary&#34; hide=&#34;- Author Commentary&#34;]]
The first thing I ever wrote for the site, and for Halloweencon2022. I&#39;d been obsessed with NIGHTFALL for a while at the point I posted this, so it was nice to actually get this out there. Probably the Tale I&#39;m proudest of at the moment.
[[/collapsible]]

[[[dance-in-the-ash|Dancing In The Ashes]]]
Three monster hunters ride through the night. They come across an inn. Hijinxs ensue.
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Author Commentary&#34; hide=&#34;- Author Commentary&#34;]]
The first Tale in a series I plan on starting for NIGHTFALL. Inspiration from stories of the wildness of a modern horror TTRPG campaign a few friends play in led to the creation of Raymond, Darren and the Nighthunt Hunter Company. Stay tuned for more of these nutters!
[[/collapsible]]

[[/tab]]
[[tab GOI Formats]]
[[[quite-enough-time|Quite Enough Time]]]
Yup. That&#39;s a Fifthist song.

[[[anderson-airlines|Anderson Robotics&#39; Installation Guide: Your New Black Series Sidhe-Issue Wing Chassis!]]]

[[tab Achievements]]
The Totally Original Achievements definitely created by myself and not copied off of Ralliston which were not taken from uraniumemprire who definitely didn&#39;t copy them from Elunerazim who DID NOT steal them from Deadly Bread who&#39;s not responsible for theft from MightyMcB who had no clue Crashington used them before him who had no idea Nagiros had them too.
