&gt;Hi! Are you staff? Are you [[*user toadking07]]? This collab should only be edited by those people. Otherwise, this collab is to be locked. Want to submit a new post? Please comment it in the page discussion and await feedback/approval. The tale will be updated every so often. If it&#39;s been a really, really long time, (1 year+ maybe) please feel free to contact site staff about them updating the tale in my place, thanks.

&gt;This is a locked open collab. Toadking07 initially put out a call for entries on the forum for a segment in the Foundation After Midnight Radio podcast. After doing another few calls for entries, it felt right to make a proper page on the wiki. The response has been really lovely and I greatly enjoy all the submissions that have come in. Helps make the Foundationverse seem a little more human, a little more real.
&gt;
&gt;The page was formatted to look like the old Craigslist personal ad pages, though they are no more. &gt;Still, I think you get the gist.

&gt; During the last containment breach I was the researcher who got trapped under the falling debris. You were the black haired security guard who unloaded your gun at SCP-1305, you may know it as the Cat Lure, and drew it away from me. Without you I know I would have been turned into one of those things. I would enjoy the chance to at least buy you a drink or dinner sometime at the site cafeteria, so please reply with what SCP-1305 said just before you shot at it.

I thought I was the only one who enjoyed pineapple and anchovy pizza on a wheat crust with white sauce but after discovering the remains of your lunch set in the waste disposal unit, I have discovered that I am not alone in my strange prefrences for pizza. I would love to meet up for lunch. Please meet me in the Site 17 cafeteria tomorrow at 1:30 PM. We can share our unique tastes and maybe something more.

&gt; To the red-haired female agent I saw in the mess hall the on saturday at 12:30ish, thank you for buying me lunch. I lost my wallet and you were kind enough to buy me something to eat- I was STARVING! Sadly, you left before I could even get your name. You told me a little bit about how you used your gun. I think you referred to it as &#39;Martha&#39;? I&#39;d like to know more about you! I&#39;m stuck in the labs mostly so maybe you can tell me some stories about the outside over dinner? It&#39;s on me! Please meet me outside site 19&#39;s mess hall at 5pm on the 21st (sunday!)

&gt;user Petrograd
&gt; ------
&gt; I never learned your name. You came into Site 41 with the new transfers after they decommissioned some of the Western Alpine containment areas. The first time I ever saw you, you looked to be in your 50’s, maybe a few years younger than me, with your greying amber hair in a loose bun. When our eyes met, I saw relief cross your face, and maybe something… deeper. Then your eyes went wide, and you looked away.
&gt; 
&gt; You must have transferred away after that, but the personnel records must have been scrubbed or classified beyond my access level (which in itself is impressive).
&gt; 
&gt; I’ve been at this job for so many years, and I’ve never felt anything but alone. I’ve never questioned that bitter truth or my life of cold service, but now the doubt is there and I can&#39;t ignore it. I should know better than to ask now, but I have to know.
&gt; 
&gt; What am I missing?

&gt;user Westrin
&gt; ------
&gt; Hey, so, I&#39;m really going through a bit of a rough patch at the moment. I just have very overwhelming apathy for everything that happens. You were a researcher at Site-551, the one where I&#39;m stationed at. A really big containment breach happened, I don&#39;t know the specifics, but we we&#39;re in the safe room waiting for the MTF to get everything under control, and everyone was scared as hell.
&gt; 
&gt; You decided to pass the time with some jokes, and some personal life stories. I&#39;ll be really honest, but that&#39;s probably the hardest I&#39;ve ever laughed for as long as I can remember. For the first time in a while, you&#39;ve made me feel better when I needed it most.
&gt; 
&gt; I think we should hang out sometime. Maybe grab a sandwich from Sonic? I haven&#39;t seen you since the breach happened, so I don&#39;t know if you got transferred over or something, but when you get the chance, we should hang out.

&gt; You were the MTF agent at Site 89 who saw me, a researcher, and ran like you&#39;d seen a ghost.
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#39;t blame you. I was angry with you for a while about what you did, but in the end I did the same thing too. What right do I have to be angry, then? I understand. When someone calls on you, you have to answer. Maybe it&#39;s just a miracle that we answered the same call.
&gt; 
&gt; I know you, or at least the person you were before. I don&#39;t think running will help either of us, and maybe we can fix what broke. I&#39;m upset too, but I miss you more, and I don&#39;t think you did the wrong thing five years ago. Even if you&#39;re mad at yourself, or at me, I just want to talk. Even if it doesn&#39;t work out, I think we should try.

&gt; ------
&gt; Hey. We worked on SCP-231 together, I&#39;m not sure if you remember. If you took pills to forget about it and I&#39;ve just reminded you, then I&#39;m sorry. But you don&#39;t seem like the kind of person who would want to forget this experience.
&gt; 
&gt; The procedure was
&gt; 
&gt; actually, I don&#39;t even need to explain it. If you remember it, then you&#39;d know that words can&#39;t comprehend what we had to do.
&gt; 
&gt; I had nightmares for weeks. I don&#39;t know whether you had them or not, but your pep talks seriously helped. In my opinion, I felt a bond growing, and it was growing fast.
&gt; 
&gt; You voluntarily moved off-site, and I never got your personal contact info. Look, I&#39;m going through some rough times right now, and if you got me through the procedure, you can get me through this. Maybe we can talk over a drink?

&gt; In 2016, I put in a request to access documents on a time-sensitive anomaly that only manifests once every four years, only to find that RAISA had a six-month backlog on archival requests. On top of that, my request was vague as hell, less than a paragraph. But you came through for me in a day. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re a man, woman, some automated search engine that processed my request at a higher priority because of some keyword I inserted without knowing, but I&#39;d like to meet you, to say thanks in person.

&gt; You know which Boston; it&#39;s not the one in Mass., but in the Midwest. We were so busy containing the growth that we didn&#39;t get to exchange names. I was a scared rookie, and I wanted out. I was willing to down a bottle of amnestics and go back to living my life, but you showed me that we could still be human despite all of the horrible shit we see and do. Maybe we can get a drink around Christmas?

&gt; I&#39;ve been listening to my music out loud in the Site-64 cafeteria at nights for years now. Running those experiments into the early hours of the morning you often have the place to yourself when grabbing a coffee refill. You entered behind me at some point and started singing along. We talked about music for another fifteen minutes before I needed to get back to the lab. I never caught your name and I haven&#39;t seen you around the site since. Hope to see you around again sometime. Until then, I guess we simply Missed The Boat.

&gt; I still remember the day you were supposed to be terminated. I was transferred off before, of course. I don&#39;t think they&#39;d let you remember, but I&#39;d been a wreck.
&gt; It&#39;s alright, I remember enough for the both of us. I remember you asked if I was okay. I remember how your eyes looked like my sister&#39;s and I had to remind myself that preserving human life, preserving your life, it didn&#39;t matter if only lasted a month. I remember that you were the only person who laughed at my jokes on the team, how it was loud and a little hysterical. I remember the pitying look my supervisor gave me as I watched you go every night with a mix of relief and cold horror. I remember counting down in my head to the thirty-first. I think it fucked me up more than the project did.
&gt; I think you might have been the only person there who looked at me like I was still human. Seeing you at Site-11 made me feel more so than I had since. They wouldn&#39;t let you remember, but I swear I saw something in your eyes change.
&gt; It doesn&#39;t make sense to kill hundreds every months. I don&#39;t think they ever wanted me to remember you as a person.
&gt; Look, I&#39;m sorry. I want another chance. I want to talk. I don&#39;t know if I can get you a coffee, but I sure as hell intend to find out.

&gt; Where are you nowadays? Are you holding up? I feel a little silly reaching out like this, but you&#39;re the one person who&#39;s been a constant in my Foundation career, so far. In Area 12 you were the one giving the seminar to all the new researchers. You somehow managed to make it digestible, even though everything I knew about science and the world was being shattered in front of my eyes. Later, I got transferred to Site-36 because of God-knows-why, and you apparently came along too, since I saw you (beautifully) play your cello for the Site&#39;s annual talent show. I asked around a little bit, but apparently that was your last day? Then I got kicked around to Site-41. I saw you in the hallways, and in the mess hall, but I never worked up the nerve to talk to you until my last day there.
&gt; 
&gt; Which just so happened to be the day we had an unannounced containment breach drill.
&gt; 
&gt; Rambling aside, I would&#39;ve liked to have known you better, and I hope you&#39;re doing well, wherever you are.

&gt; ------
&gt; So, I think I knew you. I saw you — tall, brown straight hair, not sure of gender, high ranking at Site-31 — while walking around to the cafeteria and I just got the worst case of Deja Vu. Thought it might be just one of those things that happens, but I got to thinking about how memory&#39;s a bit fuzzy around here, what with that window meme going &#39;round and all. I thought about it longer, and yeah, I really think I must have known you at some point.
&gt; 
&gt; So, I&#39;m Level 3 Site Wide, so I&#39;ve got that little orange badge that you get, and I have 4/3018 clearance. I&#39;m out inside SCP-3018&#39;s enclosure from 9:00 to 5:00 (almost makes it sound like a normal job) every Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. Sometimes I&#39;m out there Saturdays for recreation. I used to wear glasses (got contacts now), I&#39;m a little overweight, I&#39;ve got a mustache and the beginnings of a beard that never grows quite like I want it to. If you were erased from my memory for some classified reason, then I guess ignore this, but if not, I&#39;d really hate to forget an important person in my life.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, and if you wear glasses, uh, please don&#39;t when you come out to see me. I&#39;m supposed to be clean of window meme now, but you never know with these things.

&gt; It was the breach at Site 19 last month. I don&#39;t remember much of what happened. Maybe the higher-ups dosed me with amnestics, for some reason. It doesn&#39;t matter. I remember you. I don&#39;t remember your name, or what you looked like. I don&#39;t remember what we spoke about, or even if we spoke. I just remember that you were so, so deeply fascinating.
&gt; …I also recall that you weren&#39;t a sphere.

&gt; Hey. It&#39;s been quite a while, huh?
&gt; 
&gt; The last time we saw each other was with that 096 shit. That was one hell of a memory.
&gt; 
&gt; Out of that entire squadron, it&#39;s just me and you left, dude. You were one hell of a soldier, and even though I haven&#39;t seen you in quite some time, I bet you still are.
&gt; 
&gt; I was wondering as to whether you wanted to transfer to Damn Feds with me. We were an outstanding team, and putting our skills together once again can only be beneficial, right?
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, also, there&#39;s the $20 bucks you owe me. That can contribute, too.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope to hear back from you soon, man.

&gt; Hi. I&#39;m ███████, researcher at Site-201, but previously at Site-28. You might&#39;ve been transferred, might&#39;ve not? Anyway, back when a shipment of that shit from those Russians made it to Brighton Beach, we&#39;d declared it a Level-V breach. Of course, we called in Epsilon-10, aka those hotshots who got all the hardware we borrowed from the US. So you come in, in one of our helicopters, shooting at some tentacle flesh horror, and then manage to stick a landing on an elevated train track. Honestly, chalk it up to me being stupid and gay, but i was instantly in love. I was inspired to write this because Site-201 is the all-important support site, and if you&#39;re not transferred, you&#39;ll be staying here. Get back to me and we can have a coffee or something.

&gt; Hey, sweetheart, it’s been nice playing around in your head. Memetics, ain’t they some shit? Just thought I’d say we got off on the wrong foot, you and me. How’s about the two of us sit down and have a real… well I can’t call it a heart to heart.
&gt; 
&gt; But give me a chance, doll. I may be taking up space in your head, but I can pay rent, //if you know what I mean.// Pop in front of a mirror sometime, we’ll have a nice chat.

&gt; Hey, so, you were a researcher who was needed somewhere ASAP due to an emergency, and you were rushing down the hallway to not waste time.
&gt; 
&gt; While on your way, your wallet fell out of your pocket, with about 150 bucks, your credit card (Don&#39;t worry, I didn&#39;t look at any important stuff), some gift cards for Sonic, and a bunch of pictures of a very cute little golden retriever (Absolutely awesome dog, by the way.)
&gt; 
&gt; Hit me up when you have the chance, I&#39;d be happy to give it back to you. I&#39;m at Site-62, and I&#39;m probably not going anywhere anytime soon.

&gt;user Doctor Cambrian
&gt; ------
&gt; Hey, so, I was trying to get an experiment with SCP-████ off the ground. Since that&#39;ll probably be blacked out… the big one at Site-565? yeah, that one. Basically, the higher ups kept on saying that it wasn&#39;t worth wasting D-class on, and that we didn&#39;t have any more to spare after that containment breach back in May. Then you stepped in, reran the numbers, and got me enough to get my experiments done and then some. Without going into too much detail, those results helped cut the cost of containment down by 83% and got me promoted. I don&#39;t know if you fudged the numbers or if there was an actual mistake, but either way, I want to thank you. Maybe we can meet back up and grab lunch from that Subway just outside the Site? It feels like the least I could do. I have lunch from 12:30 - 1:45 PM; if our schedules overlap, you can find me at the table diagonally opposite the salad bar, probably wearing a Star Wars shirt. If they don&#39;t overlap, message me with your schedule, and I&#39;ll see if I can work something out with my superiors.

&gt; You - An young cadet in your twenties, leaving with Mobile Task Force Beta-10 (&#34;Time Hoppers&#34;) on a mission last Wednesday at 17:00.
&gt; 
&gt; Me - The 63-year-old female scientist that passed you in the corridor.
&gt; 
&gt; When i saw you i dropped everything in my hands and just stared, I could not believe my eyes. I knew then and there that you were the one i have searched for my entire life. I hurried away, happy and confused with a clump in my throat and butterflies in my stomach. I know it is inappropriate and probably will cause trouble but I just have to see you again.
&gt; Please meet me in the cafeteria on level 2, any day between 12:00 and 13:00.
&gt; 
&gt; I think you might be my father.

&gt; I hope you see this. Although, you probably won’t. I saw you in passing, as I was walking through the hallway at Area 2, Sector -19. You’re a researcher, or engineer, working on some kind of technology. A beautiful, intelligent woman. Your hair in a ponytail. You wear a light blue, lab coat.
&gt; 
&gt; I don’t know why I’m reaching out to you. We can never know each others’ names, jobs, or work. We’re not supposed to know where we work. So, any conversation we have will have to be a lie. But I don’t care. Let’s meet and lie to each other.

&gt; I was in the Library, doing some research into the Fyraxian Revolution (it&#39;s very hard to find good information since their culture is not exactly prone to keeping a written record). I could only reach three shelves up. I couldn&#39;t find any ladder to reach much higher. But then you came over and, just cocked your head at me. I sheepishly pointed at the higher shelves, and you umm... brought me up there. Well, you flew and just carried me like a small child. I grabbed a few books, and then we found a table in the corner where we both sat and read quietly. It was peaceful and comfortable. I forget if I even said thanks.
