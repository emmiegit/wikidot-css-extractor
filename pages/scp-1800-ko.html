**Item #:** SCP-1800-KO

**Object Class:** ##gray|(blank)##

All personnel at sites and facilities under the Korea Regional Comman must cease their assigned duties and leave work. Ensure that this directive is conveyed to personnel not receiving this document. Site directors report to Site-01K. Right now.

**Description-1:** Animals instinctively puff up their bodies when encountering enemies. The Foundation was no different. Our essence was nothing more than a facade concealed in tension. I can&#39;t even be sure if you all truly exist now. So please, those who want to confirm how far the truth goes, come.

**Description-2:** It is difficult to pinpoint what SCP-1800 is. More precisely, it&#39;s too early to judge. We don&#39;t know much, but what is sure is that everything we&#39;ve accomplished and built over the past times could vanish. We don&#39;t know the extent of this. From what I&#39;ve explored, the usual communication with the JP branch, with which we often interact, has been cut off, and the IT branch has gone completely silent. Whether they&#39;re dead or alive, we can&#39;t know unless we board a plane and go there.

I&#39;ve seen SCPs like this before. Anomalous entities that are born in video files and behave like Foundation personnel before dying abruptly. Entities that couldn&#39;t possibly figure out if they&#39;re in a video file. I hope this absurdity we&#39;re experiencing is not such a cliche scenario.

**-01K:** In the site just before, but now I&#39;m outside for some fresh air.

**-01K:** Come here.

**21K:** Administrator, I have some questions. Please tell me what the hell is going on.

//Grace picks up a long stick and turns halfway around the watchbox. She then looks at the top of the watch box.//

**21K:** That&#39;s the CCTV. The one filiming the reservoir. 

**-01K:** It is.

//Grace tries to poke at the camera with the stick, but she&#39;s too short. She passes the stick to Lee, who tries instead.//

//Lee looks at his PDA while poking the camera. The footage on the PDA does not show the stick moving at all.//

//A stone flies into the camera, breaking the lens. Lee, surprised, looks back, and he can see Grace with several pebbles in her hand.//

//A civilian, who looks like a worker from management, runs towards them from a not-too-long distance, shouting.//

//Lee tries to pull out his pistol on his waist, but he cannot feel it. He raises his hands and walks towards the civilian. The civilian stops running and starts to walk.//

**21K:** Who are you?

**Unidentified:** That&#39;s for me to say. What are you doing there?

**21K:** Go to the car first, Administrator.

**Unidentified:** No, no. This lady here threw the rocks.

//The civilian approaches and tries to snatch Grace&#39;s arm. Lee tries to intervene, but Grace punches the civilian as soon as she&#39;s grabbed. The civilian falls down, holding his neck. Grace also falls down.//

**-01K:** Ugh, I&#39;m fine.

**21K:** We&#39;re in a pickle. Let&#39;s escape first.

**Description-3:** I became aware of SCP-1800-KO quite some time ago. It was during meetings with representatives from various regional commands that I used to feel that sense of unease. Every time I tried to feel that unease, something changed little by little. It was as if a disaster that had clearly occurred in one country would neatly disappear, or an entire regional command would vanish. People reacted to such events as if they were nothing. I, too, tried hard to ignore it; perhaps everyone present was making an effort to ignore it as well.

I talked about this with the Spanish Regional Command Administrator in private. He tried to reassure me, saying it was probably just a matter of mood, but there was still a sense of discomfort in my heart. And then, he disappeared. I felt an existential dread, and I began to think that I could no longer escape it.

Hello. This is Site-13K Director Seol Semyeong.[[footnote]][[image http://scpko.wdfiles.com/local--files/SCP-1800-KO/13k width=&#34;44%&#34;]][[/footnote]]

I just checked the order to leave work. I was on vacation. However, nobody on our site is taking any contacts. I&#39;m sending this to your civilian emails since it seems like you all left your PDAs here. What is going on here? Is this a memetic or cognitohazard attack? I almost contacted Administrator Grace because of that.

I&#39;m in the main facility for a while, but not even the lights are on. Never mind the employees; what about the contained instances?

= ...

I&#39;m trying to call cognitohazard and antimeme experts in my office. Nobody&#39;s responding yet... What&#39;s more urgent is the containment facility. I hear weird noises from the basement, but the firearms cabinet is locked, so I can&#39;t head there alone. Also, who destroyed all our special containment procedure documents?

= ...

I locked all the main facility doors. If you&#39;re under there, please respond. I&#39;m going to visit other facilities.

= ...

The western facilities... were occupied by civilians. What is even happening? I&#39;m the Director, but I was kicked out. But... What can I do? I&#39;m heading to Halla now. Please respond if you&#39;re there.

= ...

Halla is gone.

The main facility is gone, too.

**Description-6:** SCP-1800-KO is a term used by the subjects to refer to themselves or the anomaly they are experiencing. SCP-1800-KO is understood to be the gradual collapse and disappearance of the anomalous world they built. The confusion arising from the experience affects the subject negatively, leading to loss of self-identity and depression. Fortunately, amnesties are effective in treating such symptoms. Thus, administration can be done when needed.

The subjects have great knowledge of the SCP Foundation, its administration, anomalies, and various standard response protocols. The anomalies they claim to exist, which count up to around 800, have their respective appropriate standard containment procedures, which could be useful for the improvement of existing Foundation standard containment procedures.

As per the decision of the Foundation Overwatch, the subjects are designated as SCP instances. This is the second anomalous instance discovered in the Republic of Korea and is pending official SCiPNET listing. How they have manifested, or how to exploit them, is under research. Several more people with similar qualities have been confirmed to be in Korea. Methods to safely secure them are under development.

&gt; **Interviewer:** There is no Site-something-K. The Foundation doesn&#39;t have plans to build any sites in Korea.
&gt; 
&gt; //Kang keeps talking, smirking.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Kang Yoonsang:** You saw Mujin with your own eyes, and still nothing? Then, your affiliation, state your affiliation.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Mujin? As I just told you, I&#39;m with the SCP Foundation. If you&#39;re asking for something like a regional branch, the Foundation doesn&#39;t have such a structure.
&gt;  
&gt; **Kang Yoonsang:** Is this all your intention, like Grace said? To use us for whatever your advantage is?
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** We... It&#39;s not like that. We&#39;re just amazed to discover you. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re familiar, but I have visited to contain the first anomalous instance ever discovered in Korea - more precisely, an anomalous location. It&#39;s a small sculpture park - 
&gt; 
&gt; **Kang Yoonsang:** Why are you different from all of us? Because you&#39;re a foreigner?
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** It&#39;s where sculptures appear and disappear. We-
&gt; 
&gt; **Kang Yoonsang:** Then, what about Grace? She-
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Okay, okay. The person you call Administrator Grace is Korean, born and raised. Our interviewer tried to speak to her in English, but she couldn&#39;t say a word. Haha.
&gt; 
&gt; **Kang Yoonsang:** What?
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewee:** She&#39;s struggling. She&#39;s going through the torment of a crumpled identity.
&gt; 
&gt; //The interviewer pulls out something from a pocket. It&#39;s a driver&#39;s licence. The name reads Choi Oo-ah. The photo is of an East-Asian woman. There is a national registration number: she&#39;s not a foreigner.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Kang looks around. The guards are foreigners. The plaque on the interview room is in English. All those who pass in front of the room are foreigners. The sheet is in English. Even the pen he&#39;s holding is made overseas.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Kang Yoonsang:** Hahaha... Well, this is...
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** You are the second anomalous instance we&#39;ve found in Korea. Of course, we won&#39;t treat you like any other run-of-the-mill SCPs. You have much deeper knowledge than we anticipated. Some might help us a lot. Unlike what the other &#34;Director&#34; Yeon Soha worried, your presence is not meaningless at all. Your work cannot be ignored. Thanks to you, we could understand the region better and expect to establish appropriate containment protocols based on your potential instances. You&#39;re expected to be an advisor of sorts. In return, we just ask for your cooperation.
&gt; 
&gt; //Kang bursts out laughing.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Kang Yoonsang:** So, you&#39;re going to name us SCP-002-KO or something?
&gt; 
&gt; //The interviewer tilts his head.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Hmm, I don&#39;t know. Do we have to put K and O after the object number? There should be an empty slot in the 13,000s, just like it has ever been.
&gt; 
&gt; //Kang&#39;s smile quickly fades away.//
&gt; 
&gt; //The interviewer packed his belongings and stood up.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** This took longer than expected. I&#39;ll see you around. Once again, we need your cooperation. Tell us whatever you need. In addition, this is a thanks to all of you from us. Thank you for helping us grow.
&gt; 
&gt; //The interviewer bows and leaves the place.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Kang Yoonsang:** This is... Yes, the Foundation... The Foundation is such a great place.
&gt;

Thanks to the information provided by Mr Ahn Ikdae, we were able to track more people experiencing a similar situation. In a house in Incheon, we safely secured Seol Semyeong, who claimed to be the Director of Site-13K, and Lee Taejin, who claimed to be the Director of Site-37K. 

They went through seven days of interviews, followed by the administration of amnestics.
