**The Rampart, the Rogue, and the Renegade:** (with [[*user Boogey_Man23]])

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ How does Frank eat?&#34; hide=&#34;- He snorts lines of baby food&#34;]]


I started this off as a solo project, originally posting it in a barely-recognisable form onto Ideas &amp; Brainstorming. After I got my two greenlights, I started working on a draft. While I was throwing the sandbox link around in #thecritters, Boogey caught sight of it and took interest in co-authoring. I accepted, and we started reworking my messy draft. 

While the basic elements were always there, Boogey supplied an overarching narrative, focused the scope, and brought the Foundation into the UIU-GOC party. They were ever-present in that stage of that process, and I don&#39;t think the article would&#39;ve turned out as well as it did without their help.

If you&#39;re wondering, my personal favourite part of this tale has to come down to this line: 

&#34;Far away in Washington D.C., Theodore McKinney settled into a polished wooden chair, at a polished wooden table, across from a wooden Polish man.&#34;

Don&#39;t remember which one of us came up with that line, but it&#39;s still hilarious.

**A Clean, Fast End:**

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ ...well, that got dark&#34; hide=&#34; - close&#34;]]

This is what I originally joined the site to write, pretty much. SCP-079 stuck with me for whatever reason, and when an idea for a tale around it popped in my head I joined up and tried to pitch it as my first. Didn&#39;t go over so well, so I shelved it.

Fast forward a month and a half, and I&#39;ve got three articles on the site and pull it back out. After a month of drafting it, cursing my choice to use so many divs every time I forgot a bracket, and showing it to anyone in #thecritters that&#39;d listen (during which time Cerastes put up their excellent take on -079), I put it up. It&#39;s been my favourite to write, and I hope you enjoyed it too.

**SCP-4527: Crippling Indecision**

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ open?&#34; hide=&#34;- close&#34;]]

Quick note: a full explanation of what I was going for with the skip is on the author post.

So, this changed a lot when I was writing it -- it started with a much more junior main character who was struggling with a lot of insecurity, but that strayed a bit too close to a lot of other skips that did it a whole lot better. In the end I ended up keeping the general idea -- main character gets increasingly dependent on the app, to the point where their sanity starts slipping -- but also included a lot more implications that the app is manipulating them. I&#39;m generally the type of reader that needs to be bonked on the head with a baseball bat shaped like the article&#39;s narrative, so I&#39;m kind of surprised it ended up the way it is. It was a fun thing to try though, and regardless of whether that part clicked right away, I hope you enjoyed it.

**SCP-5794: Drowning**

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ &#34;...they say drowning is the worst way to die.&#34; &#34; hide=&#34;- close&#34;]]

After I finished SCP-4527, I found myself drifting away from the site. I popped back in IRC from time to time in intermittent bursts of inspiration, and started a tale draft at one point, but otherwise took my writing elsewhere. Then, about a year and a half into this hiatus I was once again popping back into IRC when out of the dusty depths of my imagination sprung forth a fully-formed SCP concept. Despite my hopes that I could make it into some lighter and cheerier than my previous series of works, I ended up with SCP-5794. It&#39;s another dark character piece like some of my previous works, but it&#39;s also my first attempt at any ambiguity -- was the anomaly using Kato, or was Kato using the anomaly?
