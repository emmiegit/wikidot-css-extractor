    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Item #:** SCP-3020

**Object Class:** [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]]Spiteful motherfucker[[/span]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]]Individuals acting as hosts for SCP-3020 are to be allowed to self-terminate through whatever means they wish.[[/span]]

**Description:** [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]]SCP-3020 is a parasite that causes bouts of depression and anger by eating the chemicals that make dopamine serotonin and epinephrine. The only way to cure SCP-3020 is by killing yourself, or someone killing you.

I saw Claudia the other day. They let us visit. Hugging doesn&#39;t work if you&#39;re both infected. We were repulsed. We fought.

She thought I had been screwing someone else before I got infected. I tried to tell her that I wasn&#39;t.

Claudia

Claudia is

the last thing i heard her say was &#34;i hate you&#34;. then she tried gouging out my eyes before the guards pulled her off, and i heard her screaming all the way down the hall as people in yellow suits marched me into a decontamination shower and shoved me into a new cell.

&#34;I hate you.&#34;

That makes two of us. I did this to you. I&#39;ll infect a dozen more before I die.

Anything that I can use to hurt myself has been taken out of the room. I&#39;ve been moved to a cell with the bed attached to the wall. My computer screen is a projection, and my keyboard is a touchscreen.

I want to die. You won&#39;t let me die. You won&#39;t let any of us die.

I thought I could help us, too, when I studied them. I thought I could fix them.

you can put glue on a shattered glass, but you can&#39;t fix it.
