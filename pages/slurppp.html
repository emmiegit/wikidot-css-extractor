##Black|My first tale posted to the site. Not only that, it was coldposted. Pleasantly surprised that it survived. It&#39;s a tale about two D-Class fellows. I wrote this after around... 3 years? Yeah, around 3 years of inactivity on the wiki. Not much to say about it. I definitely do like this one though. Based around this concept that I thought of: &#34;Someone knows that they will die in one hour. You lock them in a room with a clock counting down. How do they react?&#34;##

##Grey|My second tale and an entry to the 2021 NIGHTMAREFEST. It didn&#39;t win, but I&#39;m happy with how it turned out. It details a doctor who manages to find his way into an endless hallway. He doesn&#39;t find a way out, as it&#39;s... well, endless. If I wanted to write something that would have scared myself, I would have made the doctor immortal. Alas, it&#39;s pretty difficult to write an infinite amount of pages.##

##Grey|White torture //is// something that I&#39;m interested in. There are stories out there such as the backrooms that do a good job at portraying the horrors of infinite nothingness; wandering empty hallways for eternity, with no progress being made and all that. What I&#39;m really interested in though is //actual// nothingness. Of course, it&#39;s not so easy to write a story where someone is just stuck in a single place, and nothing happens at all. But, say, someone is given immortality. They heal from all wounds and don&#39;t require food, water, oxygen, or any physiological needs. Then, lock this person into a completely empty white cube. Indestructible, and nothing happens for the rest of eternity.##

##Grey|How would this person act, I wonder? How would their mindset compare from day one to day one billion? Would they resort to self-harm in order to introduce some colour to their prison? Would they commit self-cannibalism in order to experience taste? Would they simply become brain-dead after some time?##

##Red|A short tale about [[[SCP-3001]]]. It&#39;s about one of many Dr. Scrantron&#39;s attempts to find death. I feel like that part of the SCP was skimmed over quite a bit; apparently, there were 184-245 suicide attempts made. So this is just how I feel like one of them went down. Graphic content, self-harm warning.##

##Orange|A short tale about [[[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/shaggydredlocks-proposal | When Day Breaks]]]. Mainly about one of the flesh creature things trying to convince someone it used to know to go outside. But it gets lured into a trap where [[[SCP-500]]] is fed to it, and it starts to heal. I&#39;ve always liked this 001 proposal, and the theme is very nice to look at, so I thought that I might as well try my hand in writing a tale for it.##

## Blue|A tale about [[[SCP-6670]]]! I really enjoyed the original SCP, and the restraint shown in the video tapes only led me to want to expand on it. So here it is, a story that expands upon Parker and her daughter&#39;s interactions together as Jemma only continued to grow.##

##F669A1 |A tale about [[[SCP-087]]], I was really nervous about posting this one ;~; The thing about writing tales for these established, famous, Series I skips is that almost everything&#39;s been done before, and done //well//.

##50C878 |A tale about [[[SCP-001]]]&#39;s &#34;Berryman-Langford Kill Agent&#34;. I kind of figured that posting anxiety would at least diminish a bit, but it just seems to increase x_x. I tried to go for something really different here! I don&#39;t really know how well I pulled it off, but I meant for the tale to be &#34;off-balance&#34;, if that makes any sense.##

##8F00FF |Oh boy, pretty long tale :o It&#39;s based on the concept of an SCP that gets more dangerous to an individual the more they know about it. Naturally, this would make researching it pretty difficult, so what if they assigned a D-Class to help out?##

##5f4053|My second try at an SCP. The first one was over three years ago and failed. Writing this one was very tough, let me tell you. I don&#39;t know how you SCP writers do this more than once in a lifetime. I&#39;m gonna stick to tales from now on, but it&#39;s nice to have at least one SCP on this site... assuming it survives, that is.##

##5f4053|The main inspiration behind this SCP is a comment from somewhere. I don&#39;t remember exactly what it said, who posted it, or even where it was from, but they brought up a theoretical scenario where someone lived in a 24 hour time loop, and very day one hour is removed from that. So this is just my take on it.##

Pardon the edgy name. This is a tale that I wrote for the wanderer&#39;s library, as part of the 1000 contest. It&#39;s about the cycle of life and death, pretty much the main idea is that reincarnation is a thing, and each time the narrator dies, he has to experience each and every one of his past deaths before reincarnating again.
