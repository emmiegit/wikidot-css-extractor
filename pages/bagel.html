//I&#39;m hungry.//

What a bizarre thought. Ever had one of those? Something utterly random. Inexplicable even -- like one moment you&#39;re fine, and then suddenly you catch yourself thinking nonsense thoughts until you realize how stupid you sound. 

Is any of this making sense? I hope so. But I&#39;m still hungry. //Extremely// hungry, even. I wonder if I should order something now? Or... no, maybe I&#39;ll wait until later? Actually, I shouldn&#39;t do that. Not unless I was doing something really important.

But, of course, I&#39;m not really doing anything at all. This room&#39;s been empty since I got here. Still not for sure why though, I wasn&#39;t ever given an explanation for it. Even if someone could explain, I’m not really worried. It&#39;s not like I got lost in some janitor&#39;s closet or something. Site-19 has plenty of people in it, I&#39;m sure someone would&#39;ve said something by now if I was anywhere //but// where I’m supposed to be. 

But no, this is right. I can feel it. Oh, speaking of feeling things: I&#39;m still hungry. Maybe it&#39;s time that I ordered something. But what should I order?

//[[[/unreality-orientation|A bagel]]].//

I-- wait... who said that? That didn&#39;t sound like me. But I guess that also implies that I know what I sound like. And who really knows that, right? 

I&#39;m getting side-tracked again. I need to make a call. 

I pull my phone out and begin to dial. But I&#39;m not really sure who I&#39;m dialing for. Hopefully it doesn&#39;t matter. Just tapping digits... one by one. And then it rings.

//Ring...! Ring...! Ring...! Ring...!//

Oh, come on -- don&#39;t tell me I picked the wrong number again.

//Ring--! &#34;Hello? How can I help you?&#34;//

&#34;Hi. Do you sell bagels?&#34;

//Click!//

Oh. That&#39;s unfortunate. Maybe they don&#39;t sell them after all? I should probably try again.

//Ring...! Ring--! &#34;Hello? How can I help you today?&#34;//

&#34;Do you sell bagels?&#34;

He&#39;s been silent for a while now. I wonder if he&#39;s looking to see if they have them.

//&#34;No, but we sell donuts. Is that okay?&#34;//

&#34;Yeah, that&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll be there soon.&#34;

It&#39;s not really fine, but he asks for my name and tells me to come by anyway. Guess that means it&#39;s time to leave. I&#39;m not sure how to do that though. There are no doors anywhere. They&#39;re just gone. Maybe I can find a window somewhere instead. Or a skylight. Do you think ground lights exist? I think those would be neat. I&#39;m sure they&#39;d serve a purpose somewhere. But don&#39;t ask me about it. I just think they&#39;d be cool to have around.

I manage to walk out of the room. The exit wasn&#39;t very far, even if I had to walk a few minutes to reach it.

I&#39;m doing that thing again -- maybe it&#39;s really time to leave.

-----

Do you think your feet know that you&#39;re walking? I&#39;m sure they&#39;re at least somewhat aware of it. One foot in front of the other, stepping on-and-on. Like little toy soldiers, even. The thought makes me happy.

I don&#39;t know where I&#39;m walking to. I never did get the name. I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s nearby somewhere -- I can&#39;t imagine what I&#39;d do if it wasn&#39;t. Maybe walk some more, actually. I think it&#39;s good for you.

There are some people nearby. A mother and her child. They&#39;re walking up to me now.

&#34;Hi.&#34;

The little girl smiles at me and waves. She looks like her Mom.

&#34;Hello, stranger.&#34;

I smile back and wave too. We do that for a little while actually. Just waving. Though I don&#39;t think her Mom likes me much. She just keeps staring at me like she&#39;s seen a ghost. She looks like a ghost too. Tiny, frail, and pale all over. The girl smiles at me some more before her Mom ushers her to walk away. I think they look like a happy family.

I wonder what that feels like... maybe I should make another call.

Oh, I&#39;m walking inside now. It smells cozy. I think I&#39;m in the right place. There&#39;s another lady standing behind a countertop. She&#39;s a blonde like me. Does that make us friends?

&#34;Hi, can I help you?&#34;

She&#39;s smiling. It&#39;s all big and wide, the type of smile you give to special customers. I //feel// like a special customer. There&#39;s something about the walls that makes me itch with joy. 

&#34;I ordered a donut.&#34;

&#34;Oh, what&#39;s your name?&#34;

It takes me a second to remember. Is that a bad thing? I think it&#39;s okay if we forget things sometimes. Even if it&#39;s probably important not to. It just kind of happens. Strange how things work -- but I manage to remind myself regardless.

&#34;Alex Thorley.&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m sorry, who?&#34;

She tells me that there are no orders with that name. I try telling her it&#39;s okay. She smiles at me again before offering a bagel. I think it&#39;s maybe her bagel. One that she was reserving for herself. I take it and thank her, but she seems to have already forgotten who I was.

At least the bagel still tastes good.</textarea></pre>
