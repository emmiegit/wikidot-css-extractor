**Item #:** SCP-6376
[[include component:image-block
    name=fog_man.png|
    caption=SCP-6376|
    width=300px
]]
**Object Class:** Euclid

**Location:** __Site-666__

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6376 will be in a 10M x 5M x 5M concrete room in site-666 with thermal cameras, a 100 lumens lamp and a bulletproof tinted window.

The window leads to a symetrical looking room where a Class-D subject will be placed at 2 to 3 hour intervals in a wooden chair.

The chair will be in a 180° angle in relation to the window. Upon the entry of the Class-D a head lock in the chair will be activated. Once the two or three hours have passed since the entry of the Subject, it will be replaced with a &#34;new&#34; one, then it will be provided with a stress test.


**Description:** SCP-6376 is a humanoid creature with black tinted skin and black fog surrounding it, seems to be around 1.5 and 2.3 meters tall. It doesn&#39;t react to light, instead it tries to get to any dark places in a room. His skin produces high-frequency sound waves with the ability to shatter glass on contact, for the same reason a black-tinted bulletproof window was placed instead of a regular one.

It was found after Dr.██████ reported seeing the creature multiple times in a single day.


**Anomalies:** If the creature detects that a person within a 100km range is alone in a room with less than 70 lumens, it will disappear from where it used to be and re-appear near the subject. Then it will proceed to make noises and induce stress until it leaves the room or enters another. After that it will become totally invisible and stop making any sound for 5.3 minutes. Once that time has passed the entity will appear in the side view of the subject.

If the subject stays with the creature in his sight it will do nothing, but once it moves his head towards, once again, it will proceed to become invisible and seek for another victim.

It is invisible to regular cameras but can be seen with a thermal camera. It has also been seen that when the light in a room is less than 30 lumens, it can pass through anything in contact with the light.

**Subject: [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-096 SCP-096]** 

**Procedure: A Class-D subject provoked the appearance of SCP-6376 in [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-096 SCP-096] cell to see its reaction.** 

**Results: It seems that [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-096 SCP-096] was unaware of SCP-6376 and didn&#39;t react to it until the noises and apparitions started, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-096 096] instantly started shouting and got stressed, it was able to damage 6376 directly causing him to bleed a orange liquid of unknown composition.** 

**Analysis: SCP-6376 doesn&#39;t seem to trigger [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-096 SCP-096] effects even with close interaction but he&#39;s still aware of physical trauma and can be damaged.**

**Interviewed:** Dr.██████

**Foreword:** Dr.██████ reported seing a entity in the corner of his eye multiple times a day wich caught the attention of the foundation.

**&lt;Begin Log, ██/██/2017&gt;**

**Interviewer:** Hello Dr.██████, tell us more about the entity that you saw.

**Dr.██████:** Right, exactly at ██:00 pm i was walking towards the cafeteria when i saw someone entering the broom closet. Of course i didn&#39;t care about it because of knowing my partners and the personal of the foundation, but then i noticed he left some kind of liquid behind, it was orange and it was like water.

**Interviewer:** Was it limping? Did you see any physical damage?

**Dr.██████:** It&#39;s hard to tell... as i just said i almost didn&#39;t saw him, the thing is that when i opened the door to the broom closet i saw a big puddle of that orange liquid.

**Interviewer:** Did the liquid produced any effect in you?

**Dr.██████:** No, it didn&#39;t. From that point every 3 hours I could see him in different places like a dark corner, under tables or other places. All out of the corner of my eye...

**Interviewer:** Did the entity try to interact with you?

**Dr.██████:** It was just being annoying with me, didn&#39;t try to attack me but im sure that it was trying to take me to madness.

**Interviewer:** Last question, when was the last time you saw the entity?

**Dr.██████:** A couple of seconds ago...

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** After the interview Dr.██████ was transferred to site-79 where he didn&#39;t report seing the entity again. A Class-D subject was reported with the same symptoms and with his cooperation  we were able to contain SCP-6376.
