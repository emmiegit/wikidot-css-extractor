[[/&gt;]]

I have been
[[=]]
waiting.
[[/=]]

[[&gt;]]
waiting for what, though?
[[/&gt;]]

i have not a clue.

[[=]]
it started a while back
[[/=]]

[[&gt;]]
this text thing.
[[/&gt;]]

at first, i had no clue what was going on

[[=]]
i thought that, perhaps
[[/=]]

[[&gt;]]
it was just my computer
[[/&gt;]]


that was fucking up

[[=]]
and then I started noticing it in people too
[[/=]]

[[&gt;]]
they walk strangely
[[/&gt;]]

around the site was how I spotted them

[[=]]
always somewhat askew
[[/=]]

[[&gt;]]
who are they, anyway?
[[/&gt;]]
------
[[span class=&#34;dblock&#34;]]You really aren&#39;t meant to be here. The person you are reading about no longer exists, nor was he ever really a person. You&#39;re simply sitting here, staring at a blank terminal whilst you think you&#39;re reading an epitaph of some sort.[[/span]]

[[span class=&#34;dblock&#34;]]Stop reading.[[/span]]

[[span class=&#34;dblock&#34;]]Researcher Blake does not exist. He never has existed. Please contact your HCML Supervisor immediately.[[/span]]
------
they keep

[[=]]
getting
[[/=]]

[[&gt;]]
in the way
[[/&gt;]]

i asked them to move

[[=]]
a few times
[[/=]]

[[&gt;]]
politely, of course.
[[/&gt;]]

but they kept insisting

[[=]]
that they must walk here
[[/=]]

[[&gt;]]
that I was the one led askew
[[/&gt;]]

i don&#39;t know how many times

[[=]]
i insisted
[[/=]]

[[&gt;]]
that i was sitting down
[[/&gt;]]
-------
[[span class=&#34;dblock&#34;]]He was an error. That&#39;s all he was, in truth.[[/span]]

[[span class=&#34;dblock&#34;]]An error that gained sentience but was still fundamentally broken[[/span]]

[[span class=&#34;dblock&#34;]]We told Blake that he may help. We told an error that he would be fixed, at some point. We gave him a job, a role, a friend, a few researchers to attach him to the mainframe.[[/span]]

[[span class=&#34;dblock&#34;]]Blake still does not exist.[[/span]]
-------
I wasn&#39;t always that bad

[[=]]
whatever this is, it&#39;s a new development
[[/=]]

[[&gt;]]
we --are-- were all confused
[[/&gt;]]

They told me that 

[[=]]
I was going to be &#34;fine&#34;
[[/=]]

[[&gt;]]
I was going to be rebooted
[[/&gt;]]

I&#39;ve been stuck here

[[=]]
walking in circles
[[/=]]

[[&gt;]]
i keep telling them things but they can&#39;t hear me
[[/&gt;]]
---------
[[span class=&#34;dblock&#34;]]It was strange how attached we all grew to someone --that no longer exists-- that never existed. Blake was just another researcher, in our eyes.[[/span]]

[[span class=&#34;dblock&#34;]]We sent in a request to the Ethics Committee that Blake could possibly be an actual person that had gotten... connected to a server somehow.[[/span]]

[[span class=&#34;dblock&#34;]]We asked to make him a body.[[/span]]

[[span class=&#34;dblock&#34;]]That&#39;s why Blake --doesn&#39;t exist-- has never existed.[[/span]]
---------
I&#39;ve been

[[=]]
sat here
[[/=]]

[[&gt;]]
[[span class=&#34;dblock&#34;]]We waited for so long for his eyes to open.[[/span]]
waiting 
[[/&gt;]]

Waiting for what?

[[=]]
[[span class=&#34;dblock&#34;]]We&#39;ve been waiting for you, Blake.[[/span]]
I&#39;ve been waiting for you.
[[/=]]

[[&gt;]]
[[span class=&#34;dblock&#34;]]Why do you insist on doing this?[[/span]]
Is it that hard to believe?
