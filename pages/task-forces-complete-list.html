**Disclaimer:** If this document confuses and scares you, and you don&#39;t understand what it is, read [[[task-forces|this guide]]] first.

The following list is //not// to be considered a canonical record of Mobile Task Forces within the Foundation universe. It is intended as a tool for writers, and is not considered &#39;official&#39; by any stretch of the imagination.

If you spot an MTF that&#39;s not on this list, or create a new one for your own SCP article or tale, feel free to insert it[[footnote]]Wait to make sure your article&#39;s staying in the positive ratings (remaining at +1 or above for 24 hours) before adding the Task Force here: it&#39;s a pain to go through and clean up afterwards.[[/footnote]]. If the number is already taken, just add a new entry below the original. Likewise, if you spot an MTF in this list that&#39;s no longer in existence, or goes by a different name/number, feel free to delete/edit it! This is primarily a collaborative project, so any additional help would be greatly appreciated. The formatting for adding a new item to the list is as follows:

&gt; = **{{@@|| MTF number@@[[footnote]]If applicable, have a link here to the specific entry on the [[[task-forces|canon list]]].[[/footnote]]@@ || Codename/alias || Works it&#39;s used in@@[[footnote]]For &#39;canon&#39; task forces, or those with individual hub pages, just include a link. Hubs take priority over the [[[task-forces|canon list]]].[[/footnote]]@@ || Brief description of its purpose, goals, and current situation@@[[footnote]]Feel free to write whatever here if it&#39;s your MTF, but try to keep it fairly unobjectionable if it&#39;s not. It&#39;s not mandatory, but something more detailed than &#34;SCP-specific Task Force&#34; would be nice![[/footnote]]@@ ||@@}}**

Entries marked with a &#39;•&#39; have been fully verified, and are confirmed to be accurate and up-to-date (or rather, as up-to-date as I can manage). Other stuff should be fine as well, but make sure to check first, and please don&#39;t verify your own entries! Verifying is done by members of Staff&#39;s [[[contact-staff#toc14|MAST]]] team (and others, with permission).

++ LIST OF TYPES OF TASK FORCES:

[[collapsible show=&#34;▷ Show list&#34; hide=&#34;◁ Hide list&#34;]]

||~ Type ||~ Abbreviation ||~ Details ||~ Example ||
|| Mobile Task Force || MTF || The standard designation, any team of people that moves from place to place can technically be given the title MTF. || MTF Alpha-1 (&#34;[[[tanhony-s-proposal|Red Right Hand]]]&#34;) ||
|| Stationary Task Force || STF || What&#39;s that? Your team doesn&#39;t move? Use an STF name instead -- if they&#39;re sitting in offices managing things, a Stationary Task Force sounds right up your alley. || STF Beta-8 (&#34;[[[SCP-3490|Bubble Blowers]]]&#34;) ||
|| Naval Task Force ||  NTF || If your team mucks about on the ocean blue, chances are they&#39;re a Naval Task Force. || NTF Delta-7 (&#34;[[[SCP-3700|Northern Storm]]]&#34;) ||
|| Provisional Task Force || PTF || Any task force formed to counter a single threat or incident. If they&#39;re only going to be used one time, Provisional is what you&#39;re looking for. || PTF Duplic-4 (&#34;[[[scp-4029|Inner Workings]]]&#34;) ||
|| Research Task Force || RTF || More boffins than brawlers, a Research Task Force specialises in investigating either a single anomaly, suspected anomaly, or type of anomaly. As with NTF and PTF, they can be used interchangeably with MTF. ||  RTF Sigel-9 (&#34;[[[SCP-3676|Oregon Trailblazers]]]&#34;) ||
|| Reactionary Task Force || RTF || Able to respond quickly to rapid threats within a very small time frame. Some are better suited for certain scenarios than others. || RTF Iota-39 (&#34;[[[SCP-4260|Gods and Monsters]]]&#34;) || 
|| Special Task Force || STF || An esoteric, particular, or otherwise abnormal task force. Beyond that, what they are is up to you. || STF-Omega-15 (&#34;[[[SCP-2487|Dire Deeds]]]&#34;) ||
|| Joint Task Force || JTF || When the Foundation forms a group with members of other organisations, a JTF is what they make. || JTF Delta-3 (&#34;[[[the-blackbird-and-the-falcon|Organic Free Trade]]]&#34;) ||
|| Distributed Task Force || DTF || Multiple divisions, big or small, grouped under a single banner. This is the designation for you if they&#39;re tackling many things at once. || DTF Sigma-6(&#34;[[[task-forces#sigma-6|Puddlejumpers]]]&#34;) ||
|| Diplomatic Task Force || DTF || A type of task force trained and sent in to handle things diplomatically, such as negotiations and bargainings. Aren&#39;t always armed with weaponry depending on the level of threat they&#39;re up against. || DTF Zeta-8 (&#34;[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7672|Hansel and Gretel]]]&#34;) ||
|| Task Force || TF || All-encompassing designation for all types of Task Force. If you&#39;re not sure, just use this. || TF-Theta-8 (&#34;[[[scp-2791|Invisible Hand]]]&#34;) ||
|| Applied Task Force || ATF || Somewhat a hybrid between a provisional and stationary task force.  Created for the purpose of containing a single anomaly, but not temporary. Don&#39;t travel and aren&#39;t ever reassigned. || ATF Indianapolis-13 (&#34;[[[djkaktus-s-proposal-ii|Killboys&#34;]]]) ||
|| Collaborative Task Force || CTF || A task force that works directly in conjunction with other task forces or GoIs. || CTF-Psi-12 (&#34;[[[SCP-2906|Madvillainy]]]&#34;) ||
|| Cryptography Task Force || CTF || A task force designed to keep communication secure or tracking the output of information. || CTF-4753-06  [[[[SCP-4753| DATA MISSING]]]] ||
|| Oceanic Task Force || OTF || Like Naval Task Forces, Oceanic Task Forces deal with activities on the sea.|| OTF Delta-7 (&#34;[[[SCP-4778|Bay-Watchers]]]&#34;) ||
|| Orbital Task Force || OTF || A task force. In space! If it&#39;s involved in orbits or space-stations, it&#39;s an OTF. || OTF ग-3 (&#34;[[[first55|Cochrane&#39;s Children]]]&#34;) ||
|| Training Task Force || TTF || For agent trainees. || TTF-Null-Nil (∅-0) (&#34;[[[secure-facility-dossier-site-246|A Bunch of Zeros]]]&#34;) ||
|| Interstellar Task Force || ITF || This type of task force handles interstellar stuff. Things such as exploring other planets would be something an ITF would do. Think of it like an OTF, but not limited to just space stations and orbits. || ITF Aleph-Four (&#34;[[[SCP-4547|Flectere Si Nequimus Superos]]]&#34;) ||
|| Marine Fighting Team || MFT || The equivalent of an MTF, but used only by the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/spc-hub|Shark Punching Centre]]], and made for the physical, pugilistic combatance of Selachian entities. [[footnote]] If the name didn&#39;t give it away, they punch sharks. It&#39;s shrimply resharkable. [[/footnote]] || MFT Psi-9 (&#34;[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/spc-2191|Trench Gazers]]]&#34;) ||
