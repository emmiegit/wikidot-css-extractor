+ Perfectly Planned Out Planner

[[=image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/we-can-t-plan-out-our-lives-or-can-we/desk%20jgt width=&#34;600px&#34;]]

Hello y&#39;all! This is a picture of my cute little desk! Oh yeah! There I’ve got my journal, then some cute decorations and some nice jewels laid out! ! I just wanted to show this to you. Why is it relevant? Because we&#39;re going to be talking about planners! 

Now setting up planners is serious business. Because as a girl, we have a lot of plans! :P We have to get ready with our clothes and hair and make-up in the morning, we have to be absolutely perfect for our boyfriends and husbands- don&#39;t want to disappoint our man! We have long days with the girlfriends, going on shopping days, etc. So much to do!

Now there’s a lot of things that you can put in planners, like daily task lists, bullet journaling, goals, notes, etc! What we’re focusing on today is a daily task list! What is that? A planner task list is where you plan out your day, of course! You can plan out more than one at a time, or do it at the start of each day! I prefer to do one at the start of each day! Now once you make this, make sure to follow it PERFECTLY. Gotta be perfect, ya know! ;3 

I’ve always loved to journal and plan, I did even before I got into JGT but of course those are WAY more boring LOL. But I figured I’d help you all do it in style!

------

[[=]]

+ Make it aesthetically pleasing!

[[/=]]

To start out, you’ll need some GLITTER PENS!!! No planner is complete without being written in beautiful colors! Here’s a picture of mine!

[[=image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/we-can-t-plan-out-our-lives-or-can-we/pen%20jgt width=&#34;500px&#34;]]


My favorite color is pink OF COURSE but I have purple here too! But you can use any color that suits you as long as it&#39;s girly! You NEED something cute to write in—don’t want to be boring! 

Then you need a cute notebook! Mine is pink on the outside with this cute rainbow print and a nice message, but you can use stickers, decorative tape, ANYTHING! Just make sure it&#39;s cute!
------

[[=]]

+ What should you put in a planner?

[[/=]]

Second, we need to go over what to put in a planner! Here are some good examples!

* A to do list 
* Goals for the day
* Plan what your perfect day looks like 
* Daily affirmations
* Daily health goals (I always make sure to take my diet pills!)

[[=]]

------

+ Perfect Planner Example

[[/=]]

So to give you an example of a planner, I’m going to show the planner that I used to start on my journey of girlhood! I used this every day, and now I’m the lovely girl you see before you today! I decided to put notes in case I ever planned on sharing it (which I did!) When I was making this, the idea came to me to make a tutorial, so I thought I’d make it accessible! If it seems like I’m talking to you, I am! I wrote this in a physical journal, but I wrote it out in text so you could read it better!

+ Dolly’s Daily Planner (tutorial version)
[[/=]]

* Wake up in bed! I have it all decorated in cute pink pillows and bedding! 
* Shower! Gotta be nice and clean! If you don’t shower every day, that’s totally gross.
* Get all dolled up in nice make up and cute clothes! Maybe I should get new ones though? My husband says he doesn’t like them and that it’s ‘too much pink and frills’. He says whatever makes me happy, but wishes I wouldn’t have gotten rid of my old clothes. Maybe I should try more white?
* Don’t eat breakfast if you plan on eating lunch and dinner! That’s way too much food! 
* I would put take diet pills here, but mine went missing, so putting buying new ones from Ella on the to do list. I asked my husband if he’s seen them, but he said no. 
* Go to Ella’s to get diet pills + her bakery to get some sweets! Really need more of those mite mice, I was running low.
* Make lunch for Robbin. My husband was home from work today, so I was able to make a nice meal today! He insisted on doing it together like we used to, but I told him that only women belong in the kitchen and that I should serve him as his wife. (Make sure to make yourself a smaller portion!)
* Eat lunch! 
* Do dishes after lunch! Clean husband&#39;s food off both plates.
* Do chores around the house. Don’t leave that to your man! Except for the boyish ones like yard work. Clean and do laundry, make sure the house is perfect for him!
* Okay so he did the laundry already? I told him I would do it. 
* Spend time blogging on JGT! Make sure to share your experience with other girls!
* Make dinner! (Again, make sure to make small portions)
* He tried to share again! I told him I DON’T need more food.
* Get ready for bed!
* Prepare the couch&#39;s bedding!
* Go to bed!

I hope that helped you make a PERFECT daily planner for your day! Make sure to leave a comment with your opinions. Thanks for reading! -Dolly

What are you, blind? No it&#39;s not! What you&#39;re describing here is classic indoctrination from society making your husband into some woke liberal man who doesn&#39;t understand the true beauty of a woman. He doesn&#39;t like you for how you are? That&#39;s totally messed up. If everything is fine, why are you making the couch as a bed? I thought it was just you two. Cleaning food off two plates? You should have none left over.

I don&#39;t understand. Everything is perfect with my boyfriend. He loves JGT. Well, from what he&#39;s allowed to know about it. He just likes that I&#39;m his perfect girl :) I can&#39;t believe you have to withstand this abuse of him trying to force you to be some lame person. You need to be a perfect girl. He seems really unappreciative. You know, maybe you could talk to ##hotpink|@KeeLee##.

You know, it is really messed up! When I brought cake from Ella&#39;s, he wouldn&#39;t even try it! It&#39;s like he stopped trying to connect with me. He says &#39;you&#39;re not the person I married&#39;. And he&#39;s right. I&#39;m better! And yeah he... he doesn&#39;t sleep in the bed with me anymore. He says he isn&#39;t interested. The food is both his. He tries to share his food with me. Which I don&#39;t accept, of course!

I&#39;ve never talked to KeeLee personally, do you really think she could help? The reason I wanted to do a planner was because I actually wanted practice for our anniversary that&#39;s coming up soon. It&#39;s our four-year anniversary and I really want it to be special. But at this point... I feel like he doesn&#39;t love me anymore.

Oh dear, never say that. I&#39;m really sorry for what&#39;s happening with you, Dolly. I&#39;ve been observing you since you first joined, and I think you&#39;ve been doing a great job. But sometimes men don&#39;t understand, which is tragic. This is a bit cheesy, but I actually have something I could give you as an anniversary present. I wanted to give you a gift to show my support for you— girl to girl. It’s not quite ready yet, gotta make sure it’s perfect! 

Also you mentioned you journaled before you found JGT? What did you journal about? I’d also love to see your anniversary plans.

Hello everyone! So this post was specifically requested by the queen KeeLee herself! I figured I&#39;d so you what my anniversary plans for my husband are! But first, I want to show an old daily planner, which was also requested. Now warning, this was from before I was into JGT, so it’s kinda gross 🤢 also I went by a different name before I found my true nature so haha

------

+ Bailey’s Plans February 2nd, 2014

* get up, shower
* Get ready for work
* Go to work
* Pick up new PlayStation controller from GameStop cause Robbin got gamer&#39;s rage (haha)
* Wash my favorite Pokemon dress because I got barbecue sauce on it at lunch yesterday
* talk to Robbin about getting nasal strips (he snores too loudly)
* Help Robbin make dinner 
* play game with Robbin
* remember for tomorrow, go to Molly’s house, she says she has something to show me 

------

Isn’t that gross?? I’m not sure why anyone would want to see this but here it is. I’m much better now as you can tell :) 

Now onto the fun part! Anniversary plans!

I wasn’t really sure what to do to be completely honest with you girlies. But then I thought about it, and I realized that maybe I just haven’t shown myself to him enough. That I wasn&#39;t trying hard enough, and that&#39;s why he doesn&#39;t like me! What would be a better anniversary gift than fully showing myself to him? So here’s a planner I made showing what I plan to do!

+ Anniversary plans

* Wake up and get all dolled up! I will try white this time, that’s always been a pretty color to me. Use lots of makeup!
* Make a nice breakfast, but only for him! This is his day after all!
* Plan activities that are fun for him and do things he likes! 
* Watch him to his activities and stay to the side like the perfect housewife I am incase he needs anything.
* Give cake I will get from Ella&#39;s the day before.
* Offer to myself to him if he desires it.
* Make lunch! Again, only for him.
* Then dinner, only for him.
* Go to bed with him! We will surely go to bed together this time.

Those are my plans! Feel free to take inspiration for your anniversaries! :3

It was harder for me. To have to dig it up. To look at my past. When I was ashamed of myself. Overweight and ugly. Boyish. But I&#39;m beautiful now! And hopefully, Robbin will see it too soon.

[[size 125%]]###FF4599|__MissDolly__##[[/size]] [[size small]]###FF8ABF|March 30th, 2018##[[/size]]

------

My anniversary was a bust.

He didn&#39;t like it all. 

I woke up and dolled myself up for him, but he told me he didn&#39;t like it

He tried to share all three meals with me 

He wouldn&#39;t do the activities without me. &#34;You used to like doing these too.&#34;

He wouldn&#39;t eat the cake. 

He didn&#39;t sleep with me. couch. again.

------

but the next day was the worst part. I woke up and went to journal. I found it open. I don&#39;t remember leaving it open, but I must have been so tired that I did so.

I couldn&#39;t even do it. So I just went to make breakfast. 

Robbin said he wanted to talk with me. About everything. About my behaviors, about my clothes, about me. He&#39;s said I changed, and he doesn&#39;t like how. That he wants the old me back. 

He misses when we gamed together.

When we cooked together. 

When we laughed over stupid memes together.

He misses when I was me.

But I don&#39;t get it. I am me.

He said he wants to book a session with a professional! To try and talk out my problems and what&#39;s become of me!

And I... I don&#39;t know what to do. I can&#39;t disobey him. Do I have to agree?

Don&#39;t worry Dolly. I&#39;ll be saving you and dealing with your husband. Your gift was originally going to be a few months late. But it&#39;ll be early. Go to Ella, I&#39;ll give it to her. This will be dealt with.

I&#39;m so sorry for my lack of updates. I know you were all worried about me. But I return with great news! Everything is better!  ٩(๑&gt; ₃ &lt;)۶♥

Looks like Robbin FINALLY came around! KeeLee, your gift WORKED! He&#39;s been more of my perfect husband instead of what he was before! He&#39;s started being more strict with me and my appearance and has finally stopped sharing his food! I&#39;ve really enjoyed cooking for him now that he FINALLY lets me do it. Sometimes he&#39;ll just stare at me while I do it. He tells me he wants me to be the perfect woman, and we finally sleep in bed together again! He&#39;s completely stopped hating my girly dresses, and even started buying me new clothes! He&#39;s even been telling me to put on more makeup and style my hair cuter! But he always has a weird look on his face when it happens. One time he bought me a black dress though and seemed really weird when he apologized. But anyway! Thank you so much to KeeLee for her help!

Happy to have delivered this pill to you! When KeeLee said she needed help with something, my jaw DROPPED at what it was. I&#39;m so happy to do this for you.

Perfect. I&#39;ll get the kinks worked out soon enough. Let me know if you know if you need any more help. This is how things should be.
