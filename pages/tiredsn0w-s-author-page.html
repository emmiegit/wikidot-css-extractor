Here you can find all the writing I&#39;ve posted to Wikidot. It largely follows the same main characters, who have been thoroughly latched onto by my neurodivergent brain, and I have not stopped writing about them in years.

++ Super Cool art Pieces!
[[/=]]

These are a very small handful of drawings I&#39;ve seen of/inspired by my creations that I especially wish to shove into your face. It is a proven fact that writing or drawing things based off of my favourite characters throws me into hysterics.

^^I would highly recommend opening these in a new tab!^^

I love all of them so, so much. I would put every single image of fanart I&#39;ve ever seen here, but then it would be so ridiculously long, and that fact has me smiling like an idiot.

++ Me?

If you really want to call me a name, there&#39;s always Atlas.

You really don&#39;t need to know much about me, and I greatly prefer talking about my interests rather than myself. To strike up a conversation, all you need to do is start talking to me about [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/altitudes-hub anything at high Altitudes].

++ Acknowledgements
[[/=]]
[[*user Fierce fauna]] - For being the first returning reader who interacted with my stuff on Wikidot-- I greatly enjoy talking to you about our different ideas.
[[*user SilverScribbles]] - For getting all invested in my stories and being there for all the things I make! Your interest means the world.
[[*user Alzin Cdag]] - For making an //amazing// and beautiful series on the characters I love the most, it absolutely overjoys me that you took all that time and effort.
[[*user Raxenlew]] - For being enthusiastic about the characters, as well as giving me so many reasons to keep writing. Thank you for showing me what sweetness feels like.
[[*user Charlie80827]] - For reading my drafts at lunch, and making hysterical jokes about skips. Bong mask 2k21.
[[*user mrmph]] - For being along for so much of the ride, nurturing my concepts for 6118, and Just Being There.
[[*user allyzero]] - For being an awesome beta reader and giving me great feedback on my Tales, as well as enthusiasm about my story, and encouraging me to keep writing.
**Mark Green** - For answering my random medical questions, as well as providing me with fantastic images.
**Yesenia** - For keeping helping me unjumble the big ugly knot of thoughts in my head. Turns out, writing and re-writing bad endings is rather cathartic.
[[*user ancientcatparent]] - For being sympathetic to writer struggles and convincing me to post my darlings, as well as beta reading.
[[*user caspian2]] - For giving me the crit that shaped everything. The entire reason that it even survived. Also, featuring me in the reviewer&#39;s spotlight? That blew my mind.
[[*user Nils Severin]] - For making 6118 ready to be shown to the world.

**And, obviously, to everyone who votes and gives me comments!**
Your support and feedback literally mean the world to me. I cannot express the gratitude I have for every single person that has made me want to keep writing.
