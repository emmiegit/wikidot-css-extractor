**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6979 is to be followed and intercepted on each of its manifestations. SCP-6979 has been equipped with a tracker and an interdimensional translocating device has been built inside SCP-6979-1, allowing for SCP-6979&#39;s geopositioning regardless of its current dimensional location. The tracker is to be equipped inside SCP-6979-1 following every manifestation, with a kit to build it given to the intercepting team&#39;s designated engineer. The designated engineer must also perform maintenance work on the translocating device.

SCP-6979-1 is currently inaccessible without the help of SCP-6979, and thus does not need containment. Its current extent and population, however, has not been confirmed, and is expected to remain unconfirmed for the foreseeable future. Due to it possibly being able to affect the entirety of the entire territory of Japan, its disruption and risk classes have been adjusted accordingly.

**Description:** SCP-6979 is a selectively corporeal humanoid entity that resides within SCP-6979-1. Its appearance is that of a stereotypical yūrei ghost, with a disfigured face and long claws. It is able to manifest within the Greater Tokyo Metropolitan Area by assuming the form of the &#34;Kuchisake-onna&#34; (口裂け女, &#34;Slit-Mouthed Woman&#34;), an entity of urban folklore, to then follow its behavior. SCP-6979 used to attack and kill people, intercepting the entity having lowered these attacks to zero. This attack method was used by SCP-6979 as means of subsisting, feeding on ‘belief’, ‘belief’ in this case referring to the understanding of a concept as true.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]] This concept doesn’t need to be ‘real’ to be considered true (e.g., SCP-6979 uses an urban legend to materialize, which isn’t believed to be ‘real’ but exists within our reality as folklore.)[[/span]] This ‘belief’ is emitted by humans and converted into Landa particles[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Anomalous particles known to contaminate measurements of Akiva radiation. Seem to be correlated with expressions of folk-belief and/or superstition.[[/span]] through unknown means.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]] It must be pointed out that the ‘belief’ consumed by SCP-6979 isn’t created by the victims of its attacks, and thus stopping them seems to cause it no harm. This feeding process as well as the exact function of Landa particles isn’t well understood.[[/span]]

SCP-6979 has proven cooperative with Foundation assets, although it can become distant and aggressive at times, especially around armed personnel. This is believed to stem from SCP-6979-1’s occupation by IJAMEA between 1930 and 1939, which caused the death of all other inhabitants of SCP-6979-1. (Hereafter referred to as SCP-6979-2.)

SCP-6979-1 is an extradimensional space known as Mamonokai, believed to be coextensive to the total territory of Japan, of which less than 1,000 km^^2^^ have been explored. The location is an identical copy of Japan, with a few key exceptions:
* The sun is static over the horizon regardless of the time or location. Light within SCP-6979 is red, despite wavelength inconsistencies.
* All ground and soil is either covered in or replaced by soot. Analysis shows the soot to be the remains of //Aquilaria// trees, genus not endemic to the Japanese archipelago.
* All bodies of water are dark black, despite not containing any sort of contaminant.
* All buildings are identical in architectural shape to their counterparts, but are built using materials and techniques from the Muromachi, Azuchi-Momoyama and Edo periods (1336-1868).
* All electronic devices suffer damage to internal parts, especially on power sources following travel into SCP-6979. While previously believed to be because of a high-energy EMP, this was proved to be incorrect, and electronic devices that are separated from power sources suffer no damage. This only affects devices when entering into SCP-6979, and causes no damage when egressing.
* Hume levels are lower than those of baseline reality, fluctuating between 0.75 and 0.85 humes.

Access into SCP-6979-1 is only available through SCP-6979 by means of direct contact with the entity during demanifestation. Portals are known to have existed in the past, but were sealed by IJAMEA, causing a full separation between SCP-6979-1 and our world.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]SCP-6979 is able to traverse between worlds. The entity has no control over this process, only occurring when SCP-6979 begins running low on ‘belief’. The first occurrence of this happened in 1979, and is believed to be linked with a weakening of the seals placed by IJAMEA.[[/span]] A way to reactivate these portals is currently under research.

**Discovery:** SCP-6979 was first discovered in 1979, but its true nature and SCP-6979-1 were not discovered until 2014/06/25 when a D-class subject approached SCP-6979 and was taken into SCP-6979-1. A ritual was performed to learn SCP-6979’s next manifestation, which occurred 191 days later. A group was set to intercept the event, with [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/department-of-mythology-and-folkloristics-hub Mythology And Folkloristics Department] researcher Zhou Yuyan and two others entering its dimension. An interview with the entity was carried out while inside:

[[collapsible show=&#34;SCP-6979/Interview log&#34; hide=&#34;Close collapsible&#34;]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**__Interview Log__**

**Interviewed:** SCP-6979

**Interviewer:** Dr. Zhou Yuyan

------

**Dr. Zhou:** The recording device seems to be working… Alright, I will start the interview now, if that’s fine with you.

**SCP-6979:** It’s not, but I’ll allow it.

**Dr. Zhou:** Why is it not, if you don’t mind me asking.

**SCP-6979:** You are Han[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]] Referring to the Han people, the largest ethnic group in China.[[/span]], yet you speak just like the Emperor’s men… I despise it. The one you sent before told me you had changed, and yet meeting you here… It’s hard to believe.

**Dr. Zhou:** I can try to speak in a less formal manner, if that helps.

**SCP-6979:** Sure. Just ask your questions.

**Dr. Zhou:** You mentioned to the D-class that came before that ‘Kuchisake-onna’ isn’t your name, but a legend that you took to… Feed, if I recall correctly? Mind explaining this?

**SCP-6979:** Questions about one’s anatomy… Just like them.

(//SCP-6979 sighs, the sound of its fingers tapping on a surface.//)

**SCP-6979:** I cannot answer your questions in a satisfying way: I myself know not how my kind works, especially for my case. We live in Mamonokai and feed off people’s faith in the tales told about our intervention in the world of your ilk. The legend I’ve taken to survive is that of the mangled murderer, the Kuchisake-onna. Does that satisfy your curiosity?

**Dr. Zhou:** How can you move to our world, if the portals are closed off?

**SCP-6979:** I… I’m not sure, actually. For the longest time, it was impossible to leave… And then one day I moved into Dakusai, but everything felt like a dream… I do not think the seal they placed has been broken, but it has certainly weakened.

**Dr. Zhou:** Do you know where these portals are located? We would like to investigate them.

**SCP-6979:** Promise me you will not reinforce the seals.

**Dr. Zhou:** I know you have grievances against the people who came before us, but I assure you we will not damage anything further. All we want is for you to stop hunting people on our side, and we want to fix things. We’re not here to kill the last of your race to accomplish it, especially if we can reach some sort of agreement.

**SCP-6979:** An agreement?

**Dr. Zhou:** We understand that your condition is caused by the seals placed on Mamonokai. As such, we want to open your world in exchange for your cooperation during and after the process.

(//Silence for the next 8 seconds.//)

**Dr. Zhou:** Umm…

**SCP-6979:** Why?

**Dr. Zhou:** Hm? I, uh, I already explained-

**SCP-6979:** This is too good to be true. There must be something you gain from this.

**Dr. Zhou:** I told you, we want to fix things. The Pacific War left many victims; some, like you, still suffer to this day. The people who hurt you and this place were some of our organization’s predecessors. Because of that, we want to amend things. Does that suffice as an explanation?

(//Silence for the next 5 seconds.//)

**SCP-6979:** Is… Is that-

**Dr. Zhou:** (//Sounds of a chair scraping on the floor.//) Sorry, sorry, that was… Perhaps that was a touch too casual. (//Coughs//) Anyway, mind guiding us to one of these portal locations, so we can investigate these?

**SCP-6979:** I do not mind, no. It will take a few hours, however.

**Dr. Zhou:** We have the time, don’t worry.

Following the exchange, SCP-6979 took the personnel to a location in Nakano Ward, where another IJAMEA outpost was located. No information was obtained from this visit. After 6 hours, Foundation personnel returned from SCP-6979-1, not before establishing current containment procedures, SCP-6979 accepting the use of a translocating device. Device would be implemented during the next visit, with containment technician Ariella Concepción tasked with maintenance of the tracker.

**Addendum SCP-6979.1:** During an expedition into SCP-6979-1 made on 2017/08/01 with the purpose of exploring the neighbouring Kanagawa prefecture, an IJAMEA outpost was discovered in the city of Yamato, located within the Tanaka Hachiman shrine (35°26&#39;28.0&#34;N 139°27&#39;39.9&#34;E). This outpost was a portal location, and unlike others previously discovered, contained information regarding IJAMEA activity inside the dimension. A partial transcription of pertinent documentation can be accessed below. For the full list, contact Dr. Zhou.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Sugahara:** Lieutenant Colonel, please, you must understand-

**Owada:** I don&#39;t wanna hear excuses. The Yōkai Battalion has failed. You are to abandon the project, effective immediately.

**Sugahara:** But we have a new platoon of 2,500 soldiers, ready to-

**Owada:** Hitoshi. Listen to what I&#39;m saying.

**Sugahara:** ... Yes, sir.

**Owada:** It doesn&#39;t matter how many of your critters you send to the battlefield, and it doesn&#39;t matter how strong they are, or how they can breathe fire and ice, because they&#39;re mortal. Pitifully so. A well placed bullet will be the end of them, and explosives shred through their skin just as easily as with any other soldier. A thousand of them were in Wanjialing[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]] Referring to the Battle of Wanjialing, considered one of several crucial victories over the Japanese during the Pacific War. [[/span]] last month, and all of them perished. They might look like mythical beasts, but they bleed and die like any other, and take much longer to train and deploy. It isn&#39;t worth the effort to keep this project going.

**Sugahara:** It&#39;s... I understand, but-

**Owada:** Sugahara, please. You&#39;re a brilliant man. You surely understand this project is a fruitless fight. I have already assigned you to a different regiment I know you&#39;ll excel at, so please, save the excuses. We&#39;re losing ground as we speak. We don&#39;t have the time for this nonsense. You will join Professor ██████ and oversee Mamonokai&#39;s decommission, and then you&#39;ll go back to the Mainland. Understood?

**Sugahara:** ... Understood. However, allow me to deploy this last platoon. It&#39;d be a further loss if we weren&#39;t to at least utilize them.

**Owada:** I&#39;ll allow it. Deploy these troops, and then get every one of our men out of this fantasy land and back into action.

**Sugahara:** Yes, sir.

**Assets:** To properly seal the many portals connecting to the world of Mamonokai, the following assets are required:
* A yamabushi[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]] Ascetic mountain monks, followers of the Shugendō religion. Known to be adepts in divination and purification arts.

[[/span]] positioned in each of the entrances to the Mamonokai. (12 monks in total.)
* A Zashiki-warashi[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]] Yōkai said to bring good fortune to those who encounter it.[[/span]] to be sacrificed as part of the seal, their bodies to be buried and a shrine to the God Hachiman[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]] God of archery and war in Shinto and Japanese Buddhism. [[/span]] to be built upon their remains. One sacrifice per entrance to the Mamonokai.
* A kurama-tengu[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]] Tengus (Winged legendary creatures) who reside atop Mount Kurama and have become yamabushi.[[/span]] to chant mantras and drive misfortune away while the sealing ritual is being performed. One tengu per entrance to the Mamonokai. If the number of kurama-tengus cannot be acquired, two karasu-tengus[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]] Tengus with the head of a crow. Believed to be messengers of kurama-tengus. [[/span]] will replace each and perform their duties.

Following this discovery, a team was sent to the Tanaka Hachiman shrine to excavate the area, discovering the desiccated corpse of a small entity, believed to be the Zashiki-warashi mentioned in the report.

With the use of this corpse, and with the help of GoI-551 (&#34;Shūshū-In&#34;), Project Kakurenbo was able to build machinery capable of reopening and maintaining the sealed portals into SCP-6979-1. Using Scranton Reality Anchors as base, the system was capable of siphoning and maintaining a constant reality flow between the two areas. This system, named the Çağlayan Reality Diffusion System (ÇRDS), was tested under controlled conditions, passing all tests. It’s believed it’ll be ready to be deployed within the first half of 2019.

**Addendum SCP-6979.2:** On 2019/04/11, the ÇRDS was deployed, successfully opening a portal into SCP-6979-1. SCP-6979 and SCP-6979-1 suffered no adverse effects, with SCP-6979 mentioning ‘Mamonokai is breathing again’. Since the opening of the portal, SCP-6979 has not manifested as the &#39;Kuchisake-onna&#39; entity, claiming ‘there seems to be no need anymore’.

Since then, vegetation has begun growing inside SCP-6979-1, and the colors of the sky and the sea have slowly changed into more natural hues. SCP-6979-1 is currently being explored, the territory of Japan believed to be fully surveyed within 5 years. Reclassification is expected to occur after this period.

Site Director Mamiya,

It&#39;s my pleasure to inform you that we&#39;ve finished exploring Shimane Prefecture. With this, we&#39;ve explored 40 of the 47 prefectures inside SCP-6979-1. Predictions estimate that the totality of the area will have been surveyed by November of the next year.

Regarding new discoveries, two new creatures have been encountered, bringing the total number of entities to 18. They have proven passive so far, and as such, no neutralization has been deemed necessary.

Last but certainly not least, the Regional Council checked the land and the stability inside SCP-6979-1, and decided to pre-approve the building of Site-281. Once Mamonokai is fully surveyed, construction of the site will commence.

Splendid news, doctor! Taking into account next trimester&#39;s budget increase, this year is shaping up to be the best for the Site since the bubble. Words cannot express my gratitude towards you and this project of yours.

Speaking of the project, how is SCP-6979 faring?

SCP-6979 has shown firm progress during her therapy sessions. Its education and integration into the Foundation has shown progress as well, although I am doubtful about the history lessons that are being imparted to her. Is there any need for the revisionist texts given to her? I find the omissions of some of Japan’s moves during the Pacific Theatre downright abhorrent. I did not join this project to allow history to be revised.

Doctor, please, do not worry. This isn’t revisionism for the sake of revisionism. SCP-6979 is an erratic anomaly with trauma related to Japan’s history. This is for its sake; we do not need its months of therapy to go to waste, no? Furthermore, if it begins lashing out aggressively, it will delay construction plans, which would be really unfortunate.

SCP-6979 has suffered enough, trapped in the past. Let’s instead build a better, brighter future for it. For us.

I’m sorry, director, but I cannot agree with you. My grandfather fought in Shanghai, against the IJA, so seeing his achievements erased is nothing short of insulting. History is vital for the understanding of where we’ve been, where we are, and where we are heading. To rewrite it, and feed it to a victim of history, who also has trust issues? I cannot see this as anything but malicious and/or exploitatory. Is this part of a deal with the current government? Or some sort of nationalist move by the Council Assembly? What&#39;s the reason, really?

Regardless, I formally request a change in her curriculum again. I cannot allow this.

Allow me to say just one thing: I know what happened during the war, and so do you. Everyone on this Site knows, and I’m sure most people working for the Foundation know as well. Does that not suffice? Does the anomaly really need to know, then?

I would argue that therapy and education is already more than what is usually allowed for one of its kind. Raising complaints could easily take all this away. Another directive body would have easily put the entity in a cage and thrown the key away, especially now that we know how to deal with it, so do not accuse me nor the Site of underhanded practices.

I firmly believe that history can both be true and also be told in several different manners. The texts do not deny anything; it’s merely cushioned, crafted such that the people who cannot, or rather should not face the truth head-on can be eased into it. This too is the Foundation&#39;s mission: To Protect from harm, and it applies to those living on both sides of the veil.

Request denied. Please return to your duties for the project, and do not speak of this again. Next time I hear this nonsense, there will be consequences. Am I making myself clear?
