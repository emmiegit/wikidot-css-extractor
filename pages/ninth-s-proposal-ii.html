**Item #:** SCP-CN-001

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- --Apollyon-- Enochian[[footnote]]Item cannot be contained due to its properties constituting an aspect of baseline reality.[[/footnote]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-CN-001 is to be contained in--

SCP-CN-001 is no longer containable.

**Description:** SCP-CN-001 is a staircase located in the southeast of the ground floor inside Area-CN-07-Ω. The anomalous effect lies in the additional underground passage that does not exist in the as-built drawing of the facility. When a human subject enters the resting platform of the staircase on Basement 1, there will be hallucinations of --a parallel world-- a world located in the upper narrative. These hallucinations have intense cognitohazardous effects and will cause the subject to become an SCP-CN-001-Α instance.

SCP-CN-001-Α will develop a strong urge to continue exploring SCP-CN-001 downward until the instance is no longer detectable by any means of communication. However, the image of SCP-CN-001 obtained by remote instruments such as drones is not anomalous and shows that Basement 1 has no stairs leading to greater depths.

According to an interview with SCP-CN-001-Ω, the creator of SCP-CN-001, the destination of SCP-CN-001-A is the world of the upper narrative. Compared to the narrative in which the Foundation is located, the world of the upper narrative has zero probability of anomalies, and the cognitohazardous effects caused by SCP-CN-001 are explained by SCP-CN-001-Ω as &#34;they just keep going since a world without anomalies is attractive.

The anomalous effect of SCP-CN-001 was first discovered in July 2012. The Foundation discovered SCP-CN-001 when AanaMalsageco, an employee at Area-CN-07-Ω, was affected by the anomaly and disappeared from the facility. However, progress on containment was hampered by the obstruction of SCP-CN-001-Ω, during which time approximately 200 Foundation employees were affected by the anomaly. After the successful capture of SCP-CN-001-Ω, SCP-CN-001 was fully contained by the Foundation.

**Updated 08/15/20██:** Currently, the anomalous effect of SCP-CN-001 has extended to stairwells leading to basements in all Foundation facilities and some non-Foundation buildings. As of the date of this update, the number of people missing as a result of SCP-CN-001 has reached ███,███, 36% of whom are Foundation members.

Now that SCP-CN-001 has the ability to create an XK class scenario, the object class of SCP-CN-001 has been revised to Apollyon. The Foundation&#39;s focus will shift to containment and control of SCP-CN-001.

**Updated 08/20/20██:** SCP-CN-001 is now the baseline reality.

The pataphysical [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lily-s-proposal|Day of Flowers]]] has arrived.

**SCP-CN-001 Exploration Video Log**

**Date:** 08/07/20██

**Summary:** To study the nature of SCP-CN-001, Dr. Desiree dispatched a D-class (D-576448) with video equipment to explore it.

-----

[Begin Log]

**D-576448:** Log Begins. The staircase is dark. Aren&#39;t there any lights or something?

**Dr. Desiree:** If you can&#39;t feel it, then there isn&#39;t one.

//D-576448 steps onto the resting platform in Basement 1.//

**D-576448:** I see it ... What ... is that?

**Dr. Desiree:** D-576448, please describe the sight you see.

**D-576448:** I wouldn&#39;t have been demoted to D-class? No, this is a world without anomalies?

**Dr. Desiree:** D-576448, I repeat, please describe the sight you see.

**D-576448:** No.

//D-576448 starts running. Tracking shows that the subject is already deep in Basement 9.//

**D-576448:** You won&#39;t understand, even if I tell you. At the end of the stairs is freedom, the tomorrow our Foundation is looking forward to.

**Dr. Desiree:** D-576448! I order you to stop exploring! If you continue to disobey, I&#39;m going to remotely sedate you now.

**D-576448:** What I see is a world where we will lose our value, a world where we will eventually arrive. Of course, who wouldn&#39;t run for it if they could be normal people instead of being D-class?

**Dr. Desiree:** D-576448, I&#39;m going to sedate you. I hope you&#39;ll calm down.

//D-576448 is remotely sedated. However, D-576448&#39;s vital signs do not stabilize.//

**D-576448:** Drugs do nothing. The thirst for the end of the stairs transcends physiology and interests. This place, like Avalon to which Arthur returned after his death, is God&#39;s declared kingdom of heaven. Sensual existence is deconstructed by reason. You can&#39;t and won&#39;t command me anymore. I will return to freedom.

//The camera shows a door, which D-576448 opens and then disappears through. The tracker is then left in Basement 1, and the camera shows that there are no doors or windows on the platform it is on.//

**Interviewee:** SCP-CN-001-Ω

**Interviewer:** Dr. Desiree

**Date:** 08/10/20██

**[Begin Log]**

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** Any cigarettes?

**Dr. Desiree:** You think you can ask me for cigarettes after the damage you&#39;ve done to the Foundation?

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** Fine.

//SCP-CN-001-Ω leans back.//

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** Actually, I like the Foundation&#39;s food too.

**Dr. Desiree:** Stop your bullshit. Tell me, did you create the anomaly?

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** I&#39;m already here. Do I have room for denial?

**Dr. Desiree:** So you admit it. Next question, why do you want to sabotage the Foundation?

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** Sabotage? Is there ever a need to sabotage it? The foundation itself isn&#39;t solid, not even in the sense of being jerry-built and fragile. It&#39;s the fact that they haven&#39;t even thought about it that much.

**Dr. Desiree:** I know that you worked in the Pataphysics Department before your arrest. What you are referring to, or who you are trying to blame in a roundabout way, are those writers. But it has nothing to do with what you did, which was a violation of the Foundation&#39;s regulations...

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** Okay, okay, I don&#39;t want to shift blame.

//SCP-CN-001-Ω interrrupts Dr. Desiree//

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** But what I&#39;m doing is not sinful at all. The Foundation exists as a program that has been running for ten years, with mountains of code piling up on top of a basic rudimentary architecture, and then a bug can scare the programmers to death. And you people will turn a blind eye and a deaf ear because the Foundation is idealistic anyway.

**Dr.Desiree:** The Foundation cannot be idealistic.

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** Yes, it is. The Foundation contains anomalies, but you never think about what exactly makes an anomaly. You have a whole theory of containment, but even your definition of &#34;anomaly&#34; is based on a vague concept that is too simple for a pupil. Come on, tell me, if anomalies are abnormal, then what is normal?

**Dr. Desiree:** The life experienced by the masses is naturally normal.

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** So I ask again, how many anomalous objects have we seen? How many anomalous events have we witnessed? Everything from molecules to galaxies are filled with anomalies, so where does normal life come from? What is its standard in this environment?

**Dr. Desiree:** I mean, the Foundation&#39;s...

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** The masses also experience anomalies, or there wouldn&#39;t be so many anomalous groups creating objects waiting to be contained. My experience in the Pataphysics Department has taught me that our anomalies are made to be contrasted with the ordinary experiences of the authors.

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** It&#39;s a void, something so taken for granted that even you and I are fooled by its sense of universality. Going back to the earlier analogy...the Foundation is now filled with a bunch of nasty bugs, and on top of that, the mountain of code keeps getting higher and higher. All I&#39;m doing is simply migrating important data away.

**Dr. Desiree:** Simply?! Don&#39;t you realize the damage you&#39;ve done to the Foundation? You do what you think is right, but how can anyone prove it&#39;s right? How can you prove that the people who disappeared went where you told them to go and weren&#39;t driven to suicide by you?

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** The losses are just lines of characters compared to what&#39;s behind that door. I don&#39;t know what you think, but the Foundation is just a dream, a dream of Brahma. I&#39;ll let everyone continue to exist before Brahma wakes up. It&#39;s a gamble.

**Dr. Desiree:** Stubbornness. The Foundation can&#39;t afford to gamble. In the early days, when it was newly founded, we could still gamble, but now the Foundation is a large international organization, with countries, government dignitaries, and researchers from all over the world waiting for us to protect the fate of mankind from the fangs of anomalies. We can&#39;t afford to gamble, you know.

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** I know, Ms. Desiree. But if--

**Dr. Desiree:** The interview is over.

08/10
I recently read a novel called //The Redemption of the Woman Undertaker//, which was recommended to me by a colleague. It&#39;s very enjoyable as a suspense novel, but the ideas in it can&#39;t help but remind me of something that happened at work ...
No, it&#39;s nothing, it&#39;s probably just me making unfounded associations.
I&#39;d like to forget the offender&#39;s argument, but the questions she threw at me made me think about what the Foundation is really fighting for.
Have I also become a corporate slave? In the beginning, I came here with high ideals, so that the Foundation could serve as a scientific frontier.
Tomorrow, I&#39;ll have to find someone else to curb her arrogance, or I&#39;ll lose my cool.

**Interviewee:** SCP-CN-001-Ω

**Interviewer:** Dr. Sophia

**Date:** 08/12/20██

**[Begin Log]**

**Dr. Sophia:** Hello.

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** Hmmm...

//SCP-CN-001-Ω snaps her fingers//

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** So here&#39;s a question: Have you ever heard of the Day of Flowers?

**Dr. Sophia:** I&#39;m sorry, but your question is not among the things that can be learned within your access. Since you are going off topic within multiple interviews, I will be the one to conduct the interview this time.

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** No, you can&#39;t. Any ciga...  Forget it, you robot won&#39;t give it to me.

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** The point is, if you want to understand my explanation, you have to talk about the Day of Flowers. I&#39;ve worked in the Foundation, and I know your process inside and out. All you have to do is ask &#34;what, why, how&#34; and get words from the people you talk to the way you dig out boogers and earwax so you can better fucking guess how this anomaly might be contained. How can that possibly fool me?

**Dr. Sophia:** ... The Day of Flowers refers to the Foundation&#39;s final containment protocol in the event of an unresolvable K-class scenario. I&#39;m well aware of that, and I&#39;m not a robot, thank you.

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** No, the Day of Flowers is a metonymy that is itself abstract and could refer to any K-class scenario. But for the Pataphysics Department, the pataphysical Day of Flowers is an opportunity to leave this world. The rest of the department and some of the Foundation&#39;s top executives have already left, leaving you people who don&#39;t understand what we&#39;re researching.

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** Don&#39;t you want to know what SCP-CN-001 really is? SCP-CN-001 is just a code name, and there are countless possibilities lurking behind this code name. &#34;So much has been written to hide the real 001&#34; or similar reasons explaining the myriad possibilities of 001 - you can easily accept them no matter how outrageous they are. What is this? It is that which has no value or meaning to be explored in the world, and about which silence must be maintained.

**Dr. Sophia:** So why are you spreading it around? According to the records, this anomaly will entice people to explore it, so why hurt others when it&#39;s just your niche quest?

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** Spreading it is not our intention. As I said before, since a world without anomalies is attractive, they just keep going, and there is nothing we who created this anomaly can do about it. It was never us who promoted this Gate of Truth, it was the rule. The big lizard comes back to life indefinitely, and the antimeme makes people forget about it, as if it&#39;s as natural as us being affected by gravity, so it&#39;s natural for this object to do the same. Have you ever visited social media?

**Dr. Sophia:** ...Yeah.

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** Social networks use algorithms to determine what should be pushed to you from the records of your input software. Many people are unaware of this technology because of their knowledge base, so they create their own cocoons of information as they are fed by algorithms. The same is true with anomalies; the world beyond pushes anomalies into our world through algorithms that they think we love. And this law is for us the unfathomable normalcy, the unspeakable of the Cthulhu Mythos.

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** To put it bluntly, we are the work and they are the author. Of course, this is nothing; if we didn&#39;t know that there was an outside to the world, we wouldn&#39;t think about this nothingness in the void. But we are confronted with anomalies that run blindly through the narrative levels, and we are forced to think about the reality beyond the world. We got lost in the fictional scene of pessimism, and then we heard the warning bells set for the afterlife.

**Dr. Sophia:** Simply put, you all ran away.

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** Not really. Aren&#39;t I right here?

**Dr. Sophia:** So last question, any solutions?

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** What? You want to be with them too?

**Dr. Sophia:** Nope. The interview is over and I&#39;m a little overwhelmed.

&gt; + [[# text-size]]Breaking News: Anomalous Effects Spreading Throughout Foundation! Urgent Precaution for Researchers!
&gt; ------
&gt; As reported by the Foundation&#39;s internal newspaper on August 13th, since the mysterious disappearance of AanaMalsageco in Area-CN-07-Ω at 0:00 on July 29th, there have been 239 cases of similar disappearances within the Foundation, all of which are thoroughly erased in the anomalous zone without any trace. Today, within 2 hours of questioning SCP-CN-001-Ω about the nature of SCP-CN-001, the anomalous effects of SCP-CN-001 spread to the staircases leading to basements of all Foundation sites and some non-Foundation buildings, resulting in 3,309 cases of disappearance and nearly one million yuan in economic losses.
&gt; After Dr. Desiree&#39;s confirmation of the list of missing persons, it has been deduced that 95% of the missing are &#34;avatars&#34;[[footnote]]We call self-inserts &#34;avatars,&#34; projections of the author&#39;s own consciousness, and even if they don&#39;t all realize it, they are still dangerous beings.- Excerpted from //Additional Lectures on the Deduction Department: Some New Theories and Answered Questions//[[/footnote]]. The O5 Council has instructed all Foundation employees to go to the nearest pataphysics department for avatar identification and to take precautions. Do not interact with objects that could alter reality or narrative levels during the incident.

**Interviewee:** SCP-CN-001-Ω

**Interviewer:** Dr. Desiree

**Date:** 08/15/20██

**[Begin Log]**

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** Yo, good morning. How come I haven&#39;t seen you here before?

**Dr. Desiree:** Fuck you.

//Dr. Desiree grabs SCP-CN-001-Ω by the collar and pins her to the wall of the interrogation room//

**Dr. Desiree:** I&#39;ve had enough of your smirking fucking face when you destroyed the Foundation. If you have any more bullshit, tell it to my missing colleagues and friends, motherfucker.

//SCP-CN-001-Ω tilts her head to avoid Dr. Desiree&#39;s straight punch to the face and kicks Dr. Desiree away//

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** Damn, I thought something was wrong. Have you finally realized that we can&#39;t reconcile without a fight? You didn&#39;t realize that just now, did you? Did you? Did you? Did you?

//Three shots are fired as Dr. Desiree pulls out a pistol//

**Dr. Desiree:** Go to fucking hell, Si Jiuhao!

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** Guess how useful a gun is to a reality bender? Not everyone is Clef.

//Dr. Desiree begins to vomit//

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** But congratulations on breaking a reality anchor on me. I should at least have some means of attack to call it a one-on-one, right?

**Dr. Desiree:** ^^I^^&#39;ll,,fuck,,^^you^^,,up,,...

//Dr. Desiree continues shooting at SCP-CN-001-Ω, but none of the bullets hit SCP-CN-001-Ω, and then Dr. Desiree faints and falls to the ground//

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** I think you&#39;re wrong. If you mean the expansion of the anomalous effect, that wasn&#39;t my fault. I never set up anything that tasteless. Besides, I think it&#39;s irrational for you to pick a fight with me in a heavily guarded room with a foul mouth... After all, the real Foundation wouldn&#39;t let you do it. You&#39;re starting to deviate from your own nature without even realizing it.

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** For the Day of Flowers is at hand, my friend.

//The footage has a 10-minute snowflake noise signal, which is an indication that the camera is blocked//

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** By the way, there is one more thing. The world beyond is also evolving, and the winds of change are blowing. The more information the observers get, the more they feel omniscient, and the result is that they add to the Foundation without knowing anything about it. The foundation is crumbling, and the coming of the cyber age means that the Foundation itself will be deconstructed into fragmented memes, so if you want to save your present self, you must travel to the Sea of the Light.

**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** The deadline is August 20th, the day before the PK Class &#34;All-In-One&#34; Existential Pandaemonium Scenario.

...
I took a phone call while I was in the bathroom, a harassing phone call, to be exact, that was cursing nonsense. Then a woman dressed like a Victorian rolled her eyes at me and left.
Damn, has she never seen a woman in work clothes before?
I know this woman. She&#39;s a mid-level manager. She scolded a worker for being indiscreet, only to be exposed by social engineers as a whore and a lover. What a hypocrite. To be honest, I just have a foul mouth, which is much better than these human-looking devils, but such people especially like to criticize the moral standards of others so that they can maintain their human skin. A beggar can never be bankrupt.
After the call, I went back to work.

The body to be incinerated today is that of a blind girl. I have seen the autopsy report ... As wretched as the news describes.
The blind girl was righteous and blind by nature. Of course, this is all nonsense. Now that the blind girl is dead and no one has come forward to identify the murderer, only I can take the body and cremate it. Actually, there is no murderer, because the blind girl jumped off by herself.
What did that blind girl go through? Bullying, rape, cult and finally death to get out of this bullshit world.
Well, bullies and rapists and cultists deserve to be orphaned, but they have been in prison for a long time. So why did the blind girl jump? Aerodynamics?
Anyway, she died and the incinerator is still burning. I wish those bastards in prison would scream in the incinerator when they are dead so I can spit on them.

Behold, nameless mortals. This is the limit of the world.
[[/div]]
[[/div]]

When I woke up, I had finished a long, distant dream in which I became a hero who saved the world and a sinner who destroyed it. In the dream world, there were various strange things lurking in the fantasy world I had imagined.
But when I woke up, the world had ended.
I seem to have forgotten something, but my heart feels as if it has been warmed by the sun.

--Our lives are so meaningless.
The riches we seek are worldly possessions, knowledge and consciousness will be buried with the body, and even our existence will perish when it is forgotten. Life begins with meaninglessness and ends with meaninglessness.
Of course, we don&#39;t have to search for meaning and don&#39;t get caught up in meaninglessness; we can never go beyond the world, so just go with the flow.
The universe, the galaxy, the earth, the country, the sky, the river, the street, and I have always existed here. Those illusory fictions are never what we need to pursue: after all, they are not the whole of life or the home of the soul, they are just the spice of life, the scaffolding that is used and then taken down to help us reach the top of the building and see the limit of the sky.

I woke up to my alarm clock, time urging me to go to a place I knew only too well. School? Company? I couldn&#39;t quite remember.
I rode my bike to my destination. The cars whizzing by and the expressionless pedestrians on the street are the everyday sights I see.
I often think about how much I expect something supernatural to change my life and make my ordinary days less boring. The boring days we go through may be a distant dream that others long for. When we create paranormal stories, we actually share the expectation with the story characters on the exotic world in the dream. But when I created too many stories of ordinary people being tormented by the supernatural, I gave up on that idea. So I deconstructed and removed the nerve-racking nihilism and wrote it in a way that readers would see it. The connotations pay homage to the work of others, while also reminding readers caught in the swamp of fantasy of their own [[span class=&#34;ruby&#34;]]ordinary days[[span class=&#34;rt&#34;]]miracles[[/span]][[/span]].

//&#34;Nor does this apply only to sacred books. All the best novels contain boring passages. A novel which sparkles from the first page to the last is pretty sure not to be a great book. Nor have the lives of great men been exciting except at a few great moments. To be without some of the things you want is an indispensable part of happiness.”//

Live happily, nameless people!
