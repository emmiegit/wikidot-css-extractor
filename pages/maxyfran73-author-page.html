Site-50, also known as Site-8150 due to its Area Designation, is a Foundation Site in Japan, located right below the National Diet building complex in Chiyoda City, Tokyo.
@@ @@
+++ History

The Site was officially built in 1946, but has been in service of documenting the anomalous since 1906, when the first version of the building was built as the Headquarters to the Imperial Japanese Anomalous Matters Examination Agency, better known as the IJAMEA. The building was surrendered and repurposed following the re-entry of the Foundation after Japan’s surrender in 1945.

Site-50’s first Site Director was [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokujiro_Kanamori Kanamori Tokujiro], Minister of State under Shigeru Yoshida. Under him, Site-50 was shaped into a place where all information collected by the IJAMEA and other anomalous agencies from Japan and the territories occupied by them was reviewed and entered into the Global Foundation Database. The Site became another example for the Americanization of Post-War Japan, adopting many of the now-outdated processes of Securing, Containment and Protection that the Foundation is well-known for.

While Tokujiro’s life as a Director was comparatively short-lived, resigning in 1953, he was vital in allowing the Foundation to take control of Japan’s anomalous scene, making several anomalous organizations, such as the Shūshū-In, Tōno Yōkai Sanctuary’s administration, Japan’s Special Affairs Division and Kisaragi Construction choose the Foundation to support over the Global Occult Coalition during the Post-War Expansion of the two organizations. He was also pivotal in the establishment of the Japanese Anomalous Groups Peace and Amity Treaty Organization (JAGPATO), which sought to solve issues between the Foundation and the GOC during this period.

The second Site Director of Site-50 became Mamiya Fukurō, the Site’s RAISA Administrator, and previous assistant librarian for IJAMEA’s main library, selected for his opposition to the biblioclasm of ‘Heretical Texts’ proposed by the Agency. His work was well liked for his expansion into the ideals of Tokujiro by bettering relationships with the branches of former territories of Japan, such as China, Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, Hong Kong, and others. He pushed for the recognition of crimes committed by the Empire of Japan and repayment of debts regarding them, a controversial movement for the time. The Foundation under him also saw major conflicts following the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girard_incident Girard Incident] and the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anpo_protests Anpo struggle], which momentarily debilitated American involvement inside of Site-50, allowing for domestic forces to have bigger control over the operations of the Foundation within Japan. Following the protests, plans to move Site-50 to another location were discussed, but were ultimately put to rest with the Director’s death in 1964. Mamiya was killed in his house, victim of the wave of attacks of politicians by right-wing activists following the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Inejir%C5%8D_Asanuma televised assassination of Inejirō Asanuma] in 1960.

The third and current Site Director of Site-50 is Fukurō’s son, Mamiya Sesshou. The assassination of the previous director, followed by the appointment of his son, a known ultranationalist, were seen as suspicious by many members of the Foundation and other Groups of Interest, especially after he began proposing changes to his father’s work. Sesshou’s tenure saw the revival of old Foundation procedures, especially dealing with the hiring and general treatment of anomalies, seen by many as ‘devolving into the barbaric methods of Imperial Japan’, and opposed several key points of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_Basic_Relations_Between_Japan_and_the_Republic_of_Korea 1965 Peace treaty between Japan and the Republic of Korea], movement seen just as, if not more controversial. Following general unrest in the region, the East Asian Regional Council lobbied for the expulsion of Sesshou from his position, and settled with the establishment of a tripartite system that would divide the Director’s power into three positions, adding the Head of Research and Head of Security positions as Directors for Site-50. This primitive, experimental system would be seen [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-120 reflected and refined in other Foundation Sites] the following decades.

1972 saw the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asama-Sans%C5%8D_incident Asama-Sansō hostage incident], in which radical activism began fading from the country, and both Japan and Site-50 focused strongly on its own internal economy. As Japan’s culture and technology quickly saw a shift, the Foundation adapted accordingly: Site-50 was rebuilt, with paratech utilized to create a much better Headquarters for the Japanese Branch of the Foundation. Japan went from four Sites and Areas to several dozens, and while events like the Nixon Shock and the Endaka Recession affected the economy, it eventually led to the Japanese Asset Bubble of 1986, which created a climate of rapid economic progress that allowed Site-50 to continue expanding, becoming one of the 10 most influential Foundation Sites during the era. The bubble burst put and following the Lost Decades period injured the country and the Site heavily, causing many of its paratechs and anomalies to be taken by other Sites, needing to resize, and allowing for entrance of foreign Foundation entities to take hold of the internal administration of Site-50. Currently, thirty to forty percent of all functions of the site are performed by either foreign Foundation departments or organizations directly unaffiliated with the Foundation.

While Director Mamiya originally opposed the denationalization of “his own Site”, age has made him less opposed to the notion. Nearing his nineties, many believe he’s become a puppet for the Regional Council, and is expected to leave his position within the next five years, either settling in the Foundation’s Nursing Home in Kitakyushu, or inside the Mamiya Family mausoleum in the Aoyama Cemetery.

+++ Facility

Site-50 used to be one of the most technologically advanced facilities during the 60s and 70s, even becoming the most expensive Site maintained in the year 1988. While it has since fallen off, it stands as a massive, self-sustainable complex that has survived through many disasters, both natural and man-made.

++++ Administrative Level

Encompassing the space right underneath the National Diet building and the Diet Library, this section is used as the main entrance to the Site, either by foot through the many Diet entrances, as well as by car through an extension to the Diet building’s parking lot. While simple in scope, it’s well guarded by Foundation agents who protect both Foundation staff as well as the members of the National Diet.

The administrative section is where all the paperwork is done, having the offices of the Site Director and most members of the Archival Division, RAISA liaisons, Internal and External Relations, Security, and so forth. Two cafeterias, an indoor park, several meeting rooms, a ballroom, and many other amenities litter this section of the Site. While big sections of this level are brand-new, you can still find bits and pieces of the old IJAMEA Headquarters these sections were built on top of.

This section is also were most of the guarding personnel is located, being the center of the Security Department. It is also the only section of Site-50 that would remain if Protocol Sakoku is enacted.

++++ Research Level

The biggest section of the Site, it’s where all research and documenting occurs. Most offices to all departments and divisions are located here: Mythology And Folkloristics, History, Historiography, three Tactical Theology divisions, Spectral Affairs, Practical Research, the rest of Archival, Anomalous Weapons Development, Procurement and Liquidation, Parazoology, etc. Well over 50 different departments work in this place, most of its members working for several departments as the need arises.

Furthermore, a massive space of empty rooms known as the “Imperial Reception Hall” is available to any personnel from any Foundation or Foundation-allied group to relocate their research groups within the area. In exchange for prioritized use of all findings, they are given a location and appropriate funds to work with.

Finally, most habitation for employees is located at the end of the research level. Several other amenities are located here as well.

++++ Containment Level

The containment section of the Site is rather small, as the Site mainly works with Safe and/or immobile anomalies, as well as data on anomalous phenomena. Still, this section is built according to standard containment measures, and contains 120 standard containment cells, of which a fifth of them are in use.

This section also contains the training grounds for the two MTF squadrons that are on stand-by at the site, as well as their housing chambers, and the housing chambers of several anomalous entities that work for the Site.

++++ Bowels

The bowels is where three massive constructs are located: One is the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1428 Yatagarasu-powered] nuclear fusion reactor powering the entire Site and a sizable portion of the Tokyo Metropolis, another being the Piping System connecting to one of Japan’s biggest Ley Lines, which cleans all water and air used in the Site. These two machines are constantly cleaned up and maintained; failing to do so would be disastrous.

The third is a [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1730 Mark VII Thresher Device] that is connected to the Bowels, as well as the Containment and Research level. The Thresher device is a relic that was used to replace nuclear detonators for Sites located in densely populated areas, which, under emergency situations, are used to perform Protocol Sakoku, which would remove most of the Site from reality. As with the two before, it is regularly maintained and has so far not been used.

-----
++++ Modular Design

One of the most unique and advanced (At the time, rather common now) technologies applied to Site-50 when it was rebuilt was a modular system in which every room within Site-50 is designed to be separated from the rest of the Site. All rooms and corridors have standardized sizes that allow for them to be sealed to stop matter from entering them or escaping them. Several systems such as tranquilizing gas, nerve gas, air purifiers and fire suppressants are installed on most of these modules. Weapons, medical equipment, emergency kits, and override systems have been installed as well.

Technicians from the Security Department are able to activate security measures that seal up entire sections of the facility, and can freely move each module through special rails that compose the layout of the facility. This way, if an emergency occurs in the deeper levels that requires medical care given on the upper levels, the injured party can be moved into a room that can be sealed, then moved into a section adjacent to the medical department, and be immediately treated there. This also allows for threats to be isolated and terminated remotely.

While the use of this modular design is immense, it requires constant maintenance that has bled through the Site’s resources on several occasions. Due to this, it’s rarely used, and only a handful of personnel have full access to it.

++++ Dimensional Railways

In 2009, Foundation personnel was able to strike up a deal with [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-023-jp a pluripotent entity capable of traversing and altering reality through railways]. With their cooperation, a system of dimensional railways were built that utilize the alteration of physical laws while crossing universes to speed up bullet trains such that they can reach any other Site in record time.

Currently, the railways are able to connect 14 Sites and Areas together. Plans for expanding the system are underway.

++++ Literary Nonsense

“Literary Nonsense” is a Food Court section located in the lodging section of the Containment Level that is partially inserted into the Wanderers’ Library. Conversations between the Head of the History Department and the current Chief Archivist of the Library bloomed during an unsupervised travel into the Location in 2012, and the area was inserted as an experimental attempt to bring peace to both parties. While controversy has arisen from both sides, the area has remained, and is well known in both the Planasthai and the Foundation’s internal press as a “step in the right direction” to fix the scars brought in by previous members of the Foundation.

A cooking competition organized by Allison Ambrose, from Ambrose Restaurants ([https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ambrose-restaurant-hub Not that one]) ([https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/ambrose-wanderers-library Not that one either]) takes place at the location, as well as a Sushiblade competition. Both have become integral festivities for Site-50.

[[tab Site Personnel]]
++++ Site Directors

**Mamiya Sesshou [間宮雪樵] - Director [管理官]**

Current Director of Site-50. Well into his eighties. Full of prejudice, hatred, and incompetence, there’s not many kind things to be said about what is objectively the worst director the site has ever had. Selected for the position in 1963 following the death of his father, he did everything in his power to destroy his legacy. Once had radical right-leaning views, and a deep contempt for Zainichi Koreans, who were blamed for the death of his father (Although no real proof of this exists). He also opposed American interventionism, political disinterest, the loosening of the family system and other ideals once defended by the IJAMEA. Sesshou also defended the objectification of humanoid anomalies, and fought hard to remove rights from them during the 80s, era where the pro-anomaly rights movement was at its strongest.

Despite these less-than-savory moments, currently, he’s no more than a bag of bones that complains from time to time, fossilized remains of a system that changed long, long ago, leaving him behind.

**Head of Security [警備責任者] - Head of Security [警備責任者]**

Head of Security is the Site’s Head of Security. They’re also a mythological entity known as a Bakedanuki, having the power of altering the perception of anyone who they touch. Bakedanukis are narrative entities, and adopt the names of the roles they represent. Thus, their name became what it is now when they gained that position back in 1992. Before then, they were a collected item by the Shūshū-In, and was contained by the Foundation after the war.

They’re highly adaptive to any situation, a trait possessed thanks to being a narrative construct. They learned to appeal to every person within the Site, becoming an emotional swindler. However, after several years, they developed a love for the Foundation past the people who hired them to work there. Currently the Director most involved in actual developments within the Site.

**Handa Hirayuki [半田平幸] - Head of Research [研究責任者]**

Handa is an old man by nature. He’s always been. Not as old as Sesshou, of course, but being in his mid seventies doesn’t make life any easier. Used to be a member of the previous Research Team during the 60s and 70s, but several deaths within the team shelved the group, and made him retire from action, and assume a position in the old Department of Research. Following the dismissal of the previous Head of Research in 2018, he received the position.

Extremely disinterested in Foundation affairs following the team’s demise, he only does the bare minimum and allows most research groups and departments to work independently, only interfering when necessary. Often mediates between the other two Directors due to the massive difference as to how they approach issues.
-----
++++ Department Heads

**Mamiya Coco [間宮ココ] - History Department Head [歴史部門主席]**

Coco is the younger sister of Sesshou, and has worked for the Foundation for a long, long time. They both graduated from the same university, and worked for the Anthropological Division of the Foundation, a group now reinvented into three different departments. Much more understanding than her brother, Coco participated in the Anpo protests, and is strongly against all her brother represents, spearheading efforts to return Chinese and Korean artifacts stolen during the War.

Coco died in 1981 during an expedition that Hirayuki Handa was the head of. Sesshou had their whole team shelved, and, using prohibited methods, brought her back to life. The move was questioned by the Regional Council, and yet another complaint was filed against the Director. The Council used the opportunity to contain and experiment on Coco, punishment for the Director’s insurrection, but was let go and rejoined the Foundation during the pro-anomaly rights movement Sesshou disliked so much, beginning to work for the Foundation during the 90s.

A compassionate soul, Coco does not decompose anymore, and cannot forget anything ever again, being immune to amnestics and many types of cognitohazards, but must consume people’s vital energy to continue moving. In this day and age where human souls can be synthesized, it is not an issue, of course, but discrimination towards hostile anomalies never ends, especially the one dished out by her own brother, who still has trouble accepting the entity she’s become.

**Zhou Yuyan [周寓言] - Mythology And Folkloristics Department Head [神話・民俗学部門主席]**

A graduate from [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/groups-of-interest-cn#CC St. Christina College], Yuyan joined the Foundation’s Chinese Branch in the late 80s, working for the Folklore Department, specializing in compilation of data left behind by the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/groups-of-interest-cn#AI Abnormality Institute], and its fights with the Qing Dynasty, as well as the occupation period of China by the Japanese. An investigation into a related item led to her joining Site-50, eventually joining the site and becoming the head of the Department of Mythology And Folkloristics.

A calm yet driven woman, Yuyan has tried multiple times to reason with the Directors of the Site, regarding quality of life improvements and, although they’ve come with time, she’s never been happy with the tardy implementation of what she believes are vital changes towards a brighter future for the world behind-the-veil. Due to this, she’s been planning for a long time to appeal for her establishment as either a Directing member of Site-50, or transfer into a different Site so that she can become its Director. So far, she has been unable to rise past her current position, Sesshou having lobbied against her several times so that she remains stagnant.

**Xiao Yamamoto [山本蕭] - Archival Division Head [文書部門主席] - RAISA Head Liaison - Secretary for Departments of Mythology And Folkloristics, History, Historiography, Memetics, Tactical Theology, Internal and External Relations, Culinary Affairs, Narrative Anomalies, Micology…**

Not much is known about Xiao, except that they’re responsible for the data of the entire Site, and at least three other Groups of Interest. Most people know him as the person who searches for a folksong to use for a History essay, who adds transcriptions to all collected information for a Sarkic cult in Hokkaido, or transcribes Anderson Robotics manuals for retired products, or rummages through seventeen centuries of data so that an Mobile Task Force knows what type of Kami they’re dealing with.

How all information a Site produces is a mystery to many. In Site-50, who is behind curating it is a mystery too.

**Isanagi Akane [日奉茜]  - Internal and External Relations Head [対内・対外関係部門主席]**

A member of the fabled [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/groups-of-interest-jp#isanagi Isanagi Clan], and liaison for the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/groups-of-interest-jp#shushuin Shūshū-In], it was expected that a woman who’s been herding anomalies for a good twenty years was to become the one who gets to keep herding them, except as part of the Foundation, and on a much bigger scale. Having some ability due to her lineage as a shrine maiden, Akane is capable of taking care of herself if the need arises. Against tons of paperworks, and a good hundred or so groups needing to speak with the Foundation each day, not even the blood of the Gods can save her.

Which is why her department has another head.

**Kamikase Ichigo [神枷苺] - Internal and External Relations Head [対内・対外関係部門主席]**

In the past, the Isanagi and the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/groups-of-interest-jp#kamikase-ichizoku Kamikase] Clans were at war. Today, the two, or whatever’s left of them work together to make sure neither of them gets an aneurysm due to the amount of work that’s required of them.

Ichigo is an energetic woman, an ex-member of the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/groups-of-interest-jp#jagpato JAGPATO], and the yin to Akane’s yang, to which Akane would say the comparison wouldn’t really make sense, and then she would explain what the Yin and Yang truly represents, and Ichigo would ignore most of it.

While Akane is in charge of paperwork and the technicalities between inter-organization relations, Ichigo is in charge of direct relations, ambassadorship work, and making sure the Foundation looks like not the shithole it actually is to outside groups.

**Hokkyōbō [法橋坊] - Anomalous Weapons Development Head [異常兵器開発研究主席]**

Karasu Tengu and blacksmith who was once the lord of a mountain, controlling an army of Yokai, but was brought down and incarcerated by the IJAMEA. In exchange for his life, he began working in their paraweaponry division, and was eventually re-incarcerated by the Foundation at the end of the war, and re-involved in the Foundation’s AWD division.

A genius of his time, but extremely against war efforts, he eventually [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-crow-gets-the-last-laugh sacrificed himself] to destroy the Foundation’s Anomalous Weapons Development department.

**Margaret Jetztmeyer - Hoplology Division - AWD Head [武器学・異常兵器開発研究主席]**

Following the death of Hokkyōbō, Margaret became the Head of the AWD department, managing to keep the division alive in a reduced shape despite the decommissioning of its Headquarters. She is also the Head of the Hoplology Division, which studies war tactics, and the weaponry and paraweaponry of the old times. A tad gone in the head, and really into bladed weapons, Margaret is among one of the more dedicated members of the Foundation, taking care of several collections of cursed and non-cursed blades throughout all Japan, and working for at least four other museums and six other organizations. The life of a sword otaku is hard, and often unrewarding.

**Tsubasa - Anomalous Communications and Relations Head [異常渉外部門主席]**

Originally known as [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-020-jp SCP-020-JP], not much is known about this winged woman other than that it was once synthesized or mutated into a project for the JOICL. Rescued then contained by the Foundation, she spent over a decade ignored, thought of as a mindless anomaly, no more than an animal.

Thanks to the efforts of a junior researcher by the name of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/helping-a-caged-bird-fly Cole Thereven], Tsubasa was properly classified as a sapient humanoid, integrated into the Foundation, and after years of education and a recommendation from Thereven, managed to become one of the founding member of Site-50’s Anomalous Communications and Relations Department, becoming the Department’s head once Thereven left the Site.

++++ Other

**Hatsuko [ハツコ]**

Jorōgumo (“Spider Woman”) and current secretary of Director Mamiya. Originally a monster collected by the Shūshū-In, came to the Foundation in the early 70s and became a project to ‘tame an uncivilized beast’. The project was by all means successful, and Hatsuko was cleared for work according to the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4395 Anomaly Rights Act] in 2016. She turned to simple pink-collar work, eventually becoming the Director’s secretary by recommendation of the Regional Council.

A ruthlessly efficient woman, she’s known for being cold and calculating, but there is a hint of something else behind her chelicerous smile. Many, including the Director, believe Hatsuko is just biding her time, waiting for the perfect moment to strike, enacting revenge on those who kidnapped her and forced her to change. Many others believe she’s just a cold person and people still can’t get over anomalies actually working for the Foundation.

**“Ron” [空]**

Real name unknown, referred to by most as Ron. Member of the Mujin-Getsudō-Shū, a group of mercenary ninjas. Acts as a low-level administrative staff, but carries out assassinations on targets deemed to ‘be against the Foundation and their values’, whether they work for the Foundation or not.

**Otis [ウーティス]**

The nervous new hire for the Security Department. Has very little presence, but is very good at his job. Seems to struggle with his own [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-man-who-wasnt-there-hub sense of purpose].

**The Conductor [車掌]**

Originally an entity within [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-023-jp SCP-023-JP], then discovered to be its mastermind, was contained and, in exchange of their freedom, allowed for their powers to become a new method of transportation the Site can exploit.

**Kuchisake-Onna [口裂け女]**

Originally known as [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6979 SCP-6979], this entity was discovered to be a lone entity wandering a dimension ravaged by the IJAMEA during their occupation of the area. She was given psychological therapy, and the dimension was renewed, a Foundation Site and adjacent Nexus for anomalous entities built on it. Kuchisake-Onna then became the Ward Administrator of this newly created Nexus, known as “Mamonokai”.

[[tab Groups of Interest]]
++++ Shūshū-In [蒐集院]

One of the biggest allies to the Japanese Branch of the Foundation, the Shūshū-In, also known as the “Collection Agency”, is a group of interest that was born in the 8th century, and was one of the first organizations to combat the anomalous in the world, and the first in Japan. Originally meant to collect and review anomalous items to protect the ruling Emperor from outside interference and [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/collected-item-no0025 foreign deities], the Shūshū-In evolved into becoming a group that cataloged all deities and supernatural entities of Japan, and made sure they didn’t interfere with the lives of the common folk, as well as securing their safety too. They kept at this for a thousand years and more, before being nearly destroyed in its totality by the IJAMEA. They managed to survive the worst parts of the War, and managed to join the Foundation when they entered the country.

Instead of fracturing and dissolving like in the original timeline (Read: JP Branch), they were allowed to continue existing under Foundation vigilance, similar to Wilson’s Wildlife Solutions, and remain one of the oldest paranormal organizations in the world, aiding the Foundation whenever the need for an exorcist or another specialist arises. Due to these close relations, Site-50 does not have divisions that deal with Heresies, Hexes, Possessions, and other such Rituals, instead relying entirely on the Agency.

++++ JAGPATO

The JAGPATO, or Japanese Anomalous Groups Peace and Amity Treaty Organization, is an organization that was born out of necessity following the entry of America and other Allied Powers into Japan following the war. During this period, the Foundation and the Global Occult Coalition scrambled to collect the remains of the IJAMEA’s technology to use in their efforts to build better and more powerful paratech. This caused tension in the eastern front that resulted in localized battles that threatened the fragile peace achieved after the 7th Occult War.

To prevent any needless bloodshed, the JAGPATO was formed in Japan, becoming a neutral party between the SCP and the GOC, capable of setting disputes and enacting policies that affected both. The model was successful enough that it was adapted into the relations model between the two to a global level. Despite this creating a certain level of redundancy, the JAGPATO continues being a strong organization, its members respected by both parties.

++++ Special Affairs Division [公安部特事課]

The Public Security Bureau’s Special Affairs Division, also known as the SAD, is the anomalous branch of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, tasked with protecting the public from anomalous threats. Being pretty much the “Unusual Incidents Unit” of Japan, they don’t have the power and technology that the Foundation and the GOC possess. Instead, they rely on creating and maintaining information networks that allows them to investigate and/or provide information regarding People of Interest, Groups of Interest, and anomalous events occurring within Tokyo, and Japan.

They mainly keep track of cults and new-age religions (Especially since the Aum Shinrikyo’s [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_subway_sarin_attack sarin gas attack of 1995]), and are on the lookout for espionage, counterintelligence, and info leak incidents involving anomalous organizations and technologies.

++++ Chikage-Kai [薙景会]

Also known as the “Chicago Sake”, the Chikage-Kai is the anomalous branch of the Yamaguchi-gumi, the biggest Yakuza organization in Japan, and the largest criminal organization in the world.

Although the Yakuza are not as prominent nowadays, they had a huge influence during the Postwar era, especially during the 60s, 70s, and 80s. It’s believed that the Chikage-Kai was instrumental in the smuggling of massive amounts of paraweapons and paradrugs to many Nexus across the world, especially in Xin Kowloon and Eurtec.

Not a lot is known about them, except that their current members are believed to be around a hundred to a hundred and fifty. They’re believed to currently be involved in real estate fraud and paradrug smuggling, and connections with the GoIs “Kisaragi Construction” and “Tou-Hei Heavy Industries” are under investigation. The branch’s matriarch is known as &#39;Ibaraki-dōji&#39;, and she’s believed to be the [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/the-child-and-the-drunkard mythological creature] of the same name.

They have shown cooperation when the Foundation is involved, and have aided in search efforts before. This odd behavior and other irregular findings have made many believe the Regional Council is involved with the Chikage-Kai. This, however, has been unable to be proven.

++++ Foundation Sites

**Site-33**

Located in Hakodate, Hokkaido, Site-33 acts as the Japanese Branch’s Main Site for Eastern Japan (North Japan), overseeing the Hokkaidō and Tōhoku regions. It oversees several outposts, and manages communication with the Chinese and Russian branches of the Foundation.

With a rich history, Site-33 acted as both an anthropological center for the old periods, as well as for the Ainu people, and, for the Foundation, it was central in establishing connections with China and Russia during the Postwar and [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-coldest-war-hub Cold War] periods. Nowadays, its use has stagnated, especially following the population decline of the area. Mainly functions as a connector between outposts, and repository for several safe-class relics.

**Site-301**

Site-301 is located in Nara Prefecture, and oversees the Kansai region. It’s the oldest building available as a Foundation site in Japan, located within the premises of the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/collected-item-no0025 Shūshū-In headquarters] in Asuka village. As a Site, it has very few functions: The Shūshū-In as an entity is in charge of most object securement, containment, and protection, leaving the personnel of the Site to deal with the many GoIs of the area.

Kansai has been a center for the anomalous for a thousand years, and has hundreds of active Groups of Interest, many neutral or directly hostile to the Foundation and its associates. Thus, Site-301 is in charge of overseeing Locations of Interest (Such as the Drunkness Street), investigating hostile GoIs (Such as the cannibalistic Sekiryu Club, the evasive Brothers’ Foodstuffs, and the extremely aggressive Gogyō-Kessha), and preventing activities from the many anomalous Yakuza organizations in the area (Such as the Chikage-Kai, the Arimura-Gumi, and the Gotenba-Kai).

**Area-808**

Area-808 is an odd one. Located in Macau, Area-808 was originally built in the area now known as the Cotai Strip to monitor shady deals regarding several businessmen using anomalous means to grow the Casino Industry of the region. Following the de-monopolization of the casino industry in 2001, Area-808 became a control station for the ‘Gambling Capital of the World’.

Area-808 has control over all manners in which the Foundation is able to generate unlimited amounts of money and/or power. All are secured here such that they cannot be used by any other party. Due to this, it’s sparsely staffed, and has four Directors that must agree on a decision to carry it out: A Foundation-issued Site Director, a God of Wealth, a Goddess of Poverty, and the Regional Manager of the PMC Company [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/groups-of-interest-zh#CO-I Cobweb International]. Any single decision regarding the area or its contents meeting outsider influence must be put through an O5 Council vote, which has led to certain stagnation. Still, the four Directors have the liberty of taking any sort of internal decision as long as they all agree upon it, leading to a gap in both command force and knowledge between the facility and the rest of the Foundation.

**Mamonokai [魔物界]**

Once known as SCP-6979-1, Mamonokai was a dimensional mirror of Japan, where the Mamono, a type of Yokai entity lived. The Mamono were once formless entities that gained form and names thanks to the folktales of Japan that they inspired, becoming a cycle that fed both the anomalous world of Japan as well as the one in Mamonokai. Following the Meiji Restoration, Mamonokai was invaded and used by the IJAMEA in order to create the Yokai Battalion, the group murdering all opposition and enslaving the remains. Over 90% of Mamonokai’s population was murdered or removed from the area, and the place was left to rot.

Following the discovery of the Kuchisake-Onna, Mamonokai was revitalized, and a town was built inside of it for the residence of anomalous entities and the flourishing of an anomalous society that would benefit Site-50 and the Japanese Branch of the Foundation in general, the once destroyed place becoming a Nexus. While some survivors have accepted the move, others still resent the Japanese for crimes committed by the Empire of Japan.

**Xin Kowloon [新九龍]**

Many know the story of Kowloon City, the self-governed enclave in Hong Kong that fell to the triads and crime, becoming a behemoth place. Many in the anomalous world also know about how it expanded, unsupervised, becoming a monster of its own due to an [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-184 artifact] used by an unknown party, later recovered by the Foundation. What many don’t know, or rather chose to forgot is how a community thrived in the place, a community abandoned by all outside groups, whether anomalous or not.

Xin Kowloon was born out of the need for anomalous groups to escape the War of Liberation/War against Communist Rebellion, turning to the city. Or, well, one city. Originally leaving for the city of [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/new-cha-ling New Cha Ling] following revolts and arson, the new group took on the streets of Kowloon during its construction and either adapted to the place and turned to a life of crime, or fought against it and accomplished very little. The Architect’s meddling allowed for many other crime organizations to decide to migrate to the unsupervised zone and create a new ecosystem where drugs, gambling, and prostitution were king.

Eventually, Kowloon fell, but not before the many crime syndicates within its walls decided to keep the place, separating most of the Architect’s work and shoving it inside a pocket dimension accessed through unknown means.

Not much is known about the current Xin Kowloon, except that it’s divided in twelve districts, each controlled by a different organization. It’s also known that the people inside of the dimension are able to traffic with people from the outside, and vice versa. The Foundation and the GOC are currently working on finding a way into the dimension, all attempts thus far having failed.
