**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6957 is to be contained in a standard low-risk humanoid containment chamber. Requests for personal items or amenities may be considered on a case-by-case basis, but allowances have remained extremely rare during its time in Foundation custody due to the inherent risk of allowing SCP-6957 readily available access to any significant amount of everyday objects.

SCP-6957 has consistently maintained a suggestible and carefree nature, to the point that it will typically prove receptive to most suggested actions one could give it, regardless of any given proposed action’s rationality, difficulty, or even potential danger to SCP-6957 itself. As such, any staff should be extremely careful when using figurative language or sarcasm, to prevent harm to SCP-6957 to itself and others.

Occasional supervised outings to Level-0 Security portions of site-55 may be authorized, as long as SCP-6957 is accompanied by at least four qualified agents for the entire duration of its journey and is pre-fitted with a specialized collar which hosts a camera affixed to it, extended far and high enough away from the collar so as to consistently capture SCP-6957’s entire body in-frame at all times.
----
**Description:** SCP-6957 is a sapient, sentient humanoid entity that, in most respects, superficially resembles a non-anomalous male human of Hispanic descent and short stature, roughly in or around their thirties. When not in direct observation, whether by eye or by camera, SCP-6957 is able to transform certain kinds of general physical objects, especially if it is around the same shape and general size or volume. While the exact mechanisms by which it achieves these changes remain unclear, SCP-6957 will happily take credit for the change regardless of whether the reaction it receives is positive, mixed/neutral, or negative.[[footnote]]Most commonly the latter, especially from those who were not already aware of its properties.[[/footnote]] Explanations for its decisions as to whether to transmute nearby objects and what to transform them into are usually framed along the lines of “remixing your day”, “shaking things up”, or similarly vague platitudes.

SCP-6957 currently refers to itself as the “Super Excelente Non-Ordinary Remixer”, though SCP-6957 has periodically changed (or “remixed”, as it calls the act whenever questioned on the changes) the second term in its self-ascribed title, even as all other words remain consistent across each iteration. Examples have included “Eccentric,” “Especial,” “Enigmatic,” “Entertaining,” and “Extra”. Other individuals, meanwhile, will be consistently referred to in conversation as “Señor” regardless of their age, gender, and/or species. All attempts at correction by Foundation staff who do not identify as male have been blithely ignored or disregarded by SCP-6957.

At the same time, despite its consistent sole use of the classically male-oriented honorific, SCP-6957 will still always utilize correct pronouns when referring to female or non-binary staff. The only explanation proffered by SCP-6957 itself regarding this inconsistency in this compartmentalized misgendering of many persons with whom it interacts has so far only consisted of variations on “Sorry Señor, the other Señor is one who would do that,” without any further elaboration, even after repeated requests or direct prompting for such. It has been noted that SCP-6957’s own appellation when referring to itself constitutes an acronym (S.E.N.O.R) if abbreviated, --though the exact relationship between this fact and SCP-6957’s use of the term &#39;Señor&#39; in reference to any and other individuals remains unclear.-- (See Update: 13/03/22). 

Certain aspects of its own appearance are subject to periodic alterations at seemingly random intervals as well, however, as SCP-6957 may at times transmute its own physical features and/or dress, similarly to how it transforms common items located within its immediate surroundings. The timeframe between anomalous appearance changes has varied from as long as six weeks between events to as little as twenty-two minutes. Examples of physical qualities subject to change during such events include: hair and facial hair color, length, and style; facial make-up, piercings, and/or tattoos; and eye color, often including non-standard hues like violet or red, or even a mix of multiple colors throughout different parts of the same iris.

However, the most noticeable ‘remixes’ to SCP-6957’s appearance typically relate to its apparel. By way of example, after almost a month without undergoing any alterations to its physical appearance, SCP-6957 underwent several over a single day on January 12, 2022. This characteristically included drastic wardrobe alterations, with looks adopted by SCP-6957 throughout the day including, in chronological order:
* A dark blue tracksuit;
* A three-piece business suit;
* A straightjacket;
* A full-body cover of mud, grass, moss, and small mushrooms;
* A light blue onesie; and finally,
* An oversized Pterodactyl costume, which SCP-6957 continued to wear uninterrupted and unchanged for the next eight days.

All direct inquiries to SCP-6957 by staff regarding these events have invariably led to responses of “We all need to remix ourselves from time to time,” or close variations thereof.
----
**Recovery:** SCP-6957 was originally discovered In El Paso, Texas following intercepted local police reports of a “street magician” suspected of repeatedly stealing the personal belongings of passersby when they were not paying attention. This was usually done under the guise of a magic trick,[[footnote]]An assertion contextually supported based on elaborate personas and apparel displayed by SCP-6957 in line with such activity, such as variations on magicians, clowns, witches, etc.[[/footnote]] and was most commonly perceived as some sort of street performance according to civilian witnesses. However, these ‘performances’ would invariably involve replacing personal items, (especially those of significant monetary or personal value) with considerably less useful and valuable items, and as such was repeatedly interpreted as blatant theft on the part of those interacting with SCP-6957. 

In each reported case, it would soon disappear “from plain sight” or “out of thin air” according to these initial reports, a factor that had allowed SCP-6957 to continue evading capture and consistent detection. The anomalous capabilities of SCP-6957 in regard to evasion and camouflage were confirmed following a Foundation sweep of the area. Recovered footage from a nearby security camera covered much of the relevant action, and a partial log is included below.

**T + 00:00 -** SCP-6957 appears from the left side of the frame, dressed in what appears to be a clown costume. It quickly spies a group of children in matching school uniforms as they are led by a few adults. SCP-6957 looks around and then makes its way into a small nearby alleyway

**T + 00:32 -** As the school group passes the alley, one child in the very back appears to notice SCP-6957 and engage it in conversation. 

**T + 00:52 -** SCP-6957 appears to say something that excites the child, and then motions for her to close her eyes. She carefully sets down a stuffed animal she was carrying in one hand, hands the balloon she was carrying in the other to SCP-6957, and obliges, covering her eyes with her hands. 

**T + 00:59 -** SCP-6957 reaches out and then makes a vague arm motion around the balloon to no noticeable effect, before donning a look of apparent confusion. However, shortly thereafter, the camera’s field of view into the front of the alley where SCP-6957 and the child are then located is slightly obstructed by a passerby, shielding SCP-6957 from its line of sight for approximately 0.6 seconds. As the pedestrian continues on, the footage then shows what had previously been a balloon had now been replaced with a metal helium gas tank, still attached to the same string.

**T + 01:05 -**  The helium tank is seen falling onto the head of the child’s doll, causing part of its head to cave in and its left arm to come off. The child is then seen to jump back in surprise and remove her hands from her eyes before having what appears to be a heated exchange with SCP-6957 for a few seconds, then wiping her eyes and running back off into the street. SCP-6957 does not follow; instead, it simply frowns and scratches its head in a slightly exaggerated manner, before turning around and walking deeper into the alley, and fully out of the camera’s sight.

**T + 09:41 -** After having “overheard a kid on some field trip sobbing to her teacher about a mean magic clown” a few minutes prior while sweeping the area,[[footnote]]...according to Agent J. Hanson in his later post-incident report.[[/footnote]] Agent Hanson and four other agents  are seen walking into the security camera’s frame while looking for evidence of SCP-6957. One agent points out the now-abandoned helium tank lying at the entrance of the alley, and the team stops to observe it and discuss. 

**T + 10:25 -** Agent Hanson begins directing routes and positions, as they variously split between searching the alley itself, entering both adjacent buildings, going further up the road, and climbing a nearby fire escape to make it onto the roof for an elevated vantage point.

**T + 18:44 -** Agent Hanson walks back into view on the roof and pulls out his terminal to begin speaking into it, apparently recalling the team to the area. Over the next minute, five other field agents each enter back into view, and soon have all gathered back in front of the alley together to discuss their next moves. 

**T + 19:52 -** During an apparent argument between Agent Hanson and another agent, one of the other four team members turns around, visibly shrugs their shoulders, and walks off into a crowd of nearby civilians unnoticed by the other five agents.

**T + 22:57 -** The arguing agents appear to calm down after intervention by one of their teammates, and soon decide to revert back to standard search and sweep procedures after concluding the child’s report and discovery of the nearby gas tank to be a false alarm.

-----
**Closing Statement:** At least four more potentially-anomalous events in line with SCP-6957’s behavior and activity patterns were noted over the subsequent 32 hours, each followed by similarly unsuccessful excursions by Foundations agents to apprehend their target. However, the fifth SCP-6957 sighting, the identify-and-capture mission proved incidentally successful. Though Field agents remained unable to capture SCP-6957 directly, it was still able to be apprehended and taken into custody after following the team of agents back to their temporary base at one point (after having once again having matched its dress to that of a Foundation field agent) and asking if it could “join their hide-and-seek club”. 

All involved task force members have since been directed to undergo //Passive Perception and Situational Awareness// refresher courses.

**Agent Benson:** Hello SCP-6957.

**SCP-6957:** Hola, Señor!

**Agent Benson:** ...Um, I&#39;m actually a woman. 

**SCP-6957:** Ah, Hola Señor Awoman. I am the Super Exceptional Non-Ordinary Remixer! 

**Agent Benson:** No that&#39;s n-- never mind. Now, while that&#39;s quite an interesting title, do you have an actual name?

**SCP-6957:** Yes! Super Exceptional Non-Ordinary Remixer.

**Agent Benson:** You know what, let&#39;s just move on. I was hoping you could explain your recent activities…

**SCP-6957:** Ah yes, I have been doing many activities. 

**Agent Benson:** Right, such as //*ahem*// “replacing a tourist&#39;s water bottle with a similarly sized molotov cocktail?”

**SCP-6957:** I like to mix things up!

**Agent Benson:** Well obviously so, to put it mildly; a lot of people could have gotten hurt. Did you even realize she might drop or toss it in surprise once she pulled it back out for a drink?

**SCP-6957:** No, of course not, and I am very saddened to hear about her third-degree burns; three  degrees is very cold, sounds unpleasant. However, you must understand, I do not ever mean to hurt people! I only mix things up, make people&#39;s days Exciting and Fun!

**Agent Benson:** I’m not sure “fun” is how I would describe spontaneously shifting every traffic sign and all the lights with a there-block radius 

**SCP-6957:** Really? I would! Gives challenge to drivers, spices up mornings; Is like signs are maze, where other drivers are walls.

**Agent Benson:** I have no idea what that’s supposed to mean. Also, even if I did, would it mitigate theeee (//Agent Benson has begun shuffling through her notes and documents//) ...17 injuries so far directly traceable to traffic accidents caused by your antics?

**SCP-6957:** I’m sorry to hear that, please send the injured señores my wellest wishes. 

**Agent Benson:** …Ok. Let’s try a different tact. When you, say, shuffled those traffic signs or... replaced that balloon with a helium container, how exactly did you undertake and facilitate those actions? 

**SCP-6957:** Magic! Or something like that, I cannot really say. I do things, not know things.

**Agent Benson:** …well, you&#39;re more self-aware than a few of my colleagues, at least, I’ll give you that. Anyway, how about the scarf? Security footage clearly shows you pulling a fluffy scarf unnoticed from a civilian’s purse, only for someone to walk in between you and the view of the camera for about half of a second, and suddenly you’re holding a wriggling snake in its place. Was that magic too?

**SCP-6957:** Yes, it is quite a trick. A magician never reveals their secrets though, Señor.

**Agent Benson:** So you consider yourself a magician then?

**SCP-6957:** Better, I’m a Remixer! A Super Ex--

**Agent Benson:** Ok, yeah yeah, I get it. (//Agent Benson sighs heavily.//)

**SCP-6957:** I don’t see problem though, was small Kingsnake, nothing venomous!

**Agent Benson:** Is that so? And what about the bottlecap you turned into a black widow?

**SCP-6957:** Oh, those are quite venomous.

**Agent Benson:** So what, were you trying to seriously hurt that little old Grandmother and her family? 

**SCP-6957:** Nope! I am fun for all families in the --whole-- hole.[[footnote]]Initially assumed to be a simple deviation of the common phrase “Whole Family,” until more detailed records of SCP-6957’s pre-containment history were recovered. See [REDACTED][[/footnote]]

//Several seconds of mutual silence pass before Agent Benson presumably realizes that no more detail will be forthcoming without further prompting.//

**Agent Benson:** …Well, then why replace her bottle cap with a dangerous arachnid?!

**SCP-6957:** Changes things up, makes excitement; lots of fun for everyone! I am very proud of my work.

**Agent Benson:** You’re proud that someone almost got very hurt from your little stunt? The poor old woman literally fell over in fright at the spider that jumped to her face, and fractured her hip on the street!

**SCP-6957:** The Senior Señor probably just got a little too excited when she noticed that her drink top had been Remixed! A very common and understandable reaction, you see.

**Agent Benson:**  (//Agent Benson presses her fingers to her temples for around fifteen seconds before resuming the discussion.//) …Uh-huh. Look, SCP-6957, I’m not sure you fully grasp your current situation. We can’t let you go around endangering people like this, so sorry but you will be entering our direct custody.

**SCP-6957:** Alrighty!

**Agent Benson:** You… um, seem surprisingly unperturbed by the news of your impending containment, I must say.

**SCP-6957:** Yes!

//Several more seconds of mutual silence pass.//

**Agent Benson:** Ok, well that was easier than I thought, I guess. (//Agest Benson begins shuffling through her documents and then reaches for her terminal.//) I’m going to go ahead and finish the relevant paperwork since I feel like we’re not getting anywhere, but we’ll pick up this conversa-- Hey! Just when did my terminal get replaced by a sketchbook with a cell phone drawn on?!

**SCP-6957:** About twenty minutes ago, on the way to this room.

//Agent Benson stares angrily at SCP-6957 for several seconds.//

**SCP-6957:** Remix!
