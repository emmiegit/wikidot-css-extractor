**Item #:** SCP-6957

**Object Class:** Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** Witnesses to SCP-6957 during its brief appearance on Earth are to be amnesticized. As SCP-6957 has relocated to an unknown region of space beyond civilian space observation stations, further containment procedures of SCP-6957 are unnecessary.

**Description:** SCP-6957 is a sapient space-faring organism resembling a disembodied tongue, twelve kilometers in circumference, which entered Earth&#39;s atmosphere on 4 July 2307. SCP-6957 remained partially submerged in the Pacific Ocean for approximately seventy-two hours before ascending into Earth&#39;s atmosphere and subsequently leaving the planet&#39;s orbit. The cause of this is unknown. 

**Addendum 6957.1:** On 3 August 2307, SCP-6957 established a one-way communication channel with Earth&#39;s deep space communication relays that was intercepted by the Galactic Foundation. The message it sent has been transcribed below.

&gt; To whom it may concern,
&gt; 
&gt; I am a Gormetian culinary expert of the highest calibur, hailing from the Ramsey System of the Plastic Galaxy. You know me by many names: Killgaroth, Consumer of Worlds; Killmonger, Consumer of Worlds; The World Eater, Consumer of Worlds; or Johnathan.
&gt; 
&gt; My clientele have hired me specifically for my exquisite pallet and measure of character, as I am well regarded for my excellent taste when it comes to devouring worlds. A visit from me is a blessing. To exist in the micro-biome of a Gormetian such as I is the highest achievement any well respecting sapient race should experience. 
&gt; 
&gt; Earth, however, will not receive the glory of my consumption, nor that of my clientele. 
&gt; 
&gt; Your atmosphere is an assault to the senses. Overloaded with a horrid amalgamation of sweet and salty that do nothing to compliment each other. Quite frankly, penetrating the planet&#39;s ocean was a refreshing reprieve from the air, although only momentarily.
&gt; 
&gt; Your oceans, by the stars, your oceans. What good is there other than the fact that it&#39;s liquid? If you can even **call** that liquid. The stentch, rotten to the core. The aquatic life are both hostile and rude, and the flavor. I shudder to reflect on the flavor. 
&gt; 
&gt; This simply will not do. There is far too much seasoning on Earth. You will rectify this immediately, and I return in another cycle to re-assess the dish. Do well not to fuck it up. 

**Addendum 6957.2:** On 3 August 2310, SCP-6957 returned to Earth, remaining suspended above the Pacific Ocean for forty-eight hours before ascending out of the atmosphere.

&gt; To whom it may concern,
&gt; 
&gt; I gave you explicit instructions **not** to fuck it up. Somehow you&#39;ve made an overcooked, over seasoned, dish raw. 
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to re-interate for emphasis.
&gt; 
&gt; Your planet has gone from cooked to raw. 
&gt; 
&gt; How in the universe did you even manage that?</textarea></pre>
