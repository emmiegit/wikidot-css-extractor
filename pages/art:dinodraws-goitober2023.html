++++ **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/goitober2023 GOITOBER Day 1 - Chicago Spirit]**

[[image https://i.imgur.com/bVJzUqV.png]]

Chose [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/carroll-105-the-jabberwock Carrol #105: The Jabberwock] by [[*user GremlinWC]]! For my first GOITOBER piece! It was a fun read, and I am a sucker for face-stealing monsters. Interpreting its design was a real treat for my creature-design enjoying heart.

[[tab Day 2 - Ruiz Duchamp]]
++++ **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/goitober2023 GOITOBER Day 2 - Ruiz Duchamp]**

[[image https://i.imgur.com/M3F15qI.png]]

Eyyyyy it&#39;s this guy. I have no idea what he looks like so I improvised a scruffed looking bitch. Drew something moderately inspired by [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nobody-dies Nobody Dies] by [[*user Randomini]] because the Cool War is something I read around last year and thinking was fun. My personal art &#34;challenge&#34; to myself was just &#39;keep it messy!&#39; so I did very minimal cleanup and also just rough painted in the colors. because this man is a MESS.

I think the plot of the Cool War could&#39;ve been avoided if Duchamp had spoken his plan aloud. &#34;I&#39;m going to change the status quo by killing Nobody!&#34; like c&#39;mon man. Buddy. Pal. I know you&#39;re going through shit but repeat that again slower to yourself.

I realized [[[ricky-vasquez |Vicky Vasquez]]] by [[*user mr-carbon]] and [[*user DrowningDutchman]] was in the Nameless tag and jumped on that like a feral dog. Checkmate fae, can&#39;t steal shit if there ain&#39;t shit to steal. I&#39;m technically a day behind right now but shhhhhh I&#39;ll catch up gimme a bit. This ones art challenge thing was &#34;draw in not your usual program&#34; you I used Aggie as opposed to my usual Photoshop.

Anyways- this is King Ragna from the PHENOMINAL [[[scp-7629 |SCP-7629]]] by [[*user WarriorofChaos]]! It is so so fucking cool with its worldbuilding and the DRAGONS HAVE AN ALPHABET! THERE&#39;S AN IMAGE FOR IT TOO IT&#39;S COOL AS FUCK. Please please please go read it it&#39;s so fun. It was fun to interpret the design of the Droganian King himself, what a pretty lookin&#39; dergen :&gt;

A borderline shitpost and homage to an inside joke between me and some friends in an scp ttrpg game. and also a toast to learning of Potatoes in that game sending me and another player on a 3 AM deep dive of the dado tag. the dado tag at 3 AM is an experience. Especially when you were blind going into it.
