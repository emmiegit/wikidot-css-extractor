//Interview with ████ █████, former principal at SCP-026.//

Agent ██████: Thank you for your time, Mr. █████.

█████: Not at all.  If there&#39;s one thing I have plenty of these days, it&#39;s time.

Agent ██████: So, let&#39;s get down to business.  You were principal of [REDACTED] back in [REDACTED], is that correct?

 █████: Yes, that&#39;s right.  

Agent ██████: What can you tell us about that?

 █████: Well, you&#39;ve heard the stories, I&#39;m sure.  Folks say it was haunted.  I don&#39;t know about that, but things did seem strange towards the end.

Agent ██████: Tell me about them.

 █████: Let&#39;s see, there were the stairs, of course.  You&#39;ve heard about that, right?  People would count fifteen coming up and sixteen coming back down.  I&#39;m sure there was a trick to it, like an optical illusion, but I never could figure it out.  And we had a history book that turned up completely blank.  [Pauses]  I suppose these seem rather tame.  But you know how it is.  Little things add up.  People tell stories.

Agent ██████: Tell me about the dreams.

  █████: The dreams?  Oh, yes.  People were complaining about nightmares.  Mostly students, but a few of the staff as well.  It was always about school never ending.  We joked about it at first, but more people talked about it.  I didn&#39;t put much credence into it, but, well, when we found the blueprints didn&#39;t match up with the school, it seemed easier just to move to a new building.  The schoolhouse was old, anyway, and we wanted a fresh start.  And, just like that, things seemed to settle back to normal.

Agent ██████: I see.  Is there anything else you&#39;d like to add?

█████: Hmm.  [Pauses]  It&#39;s not really much, but maybe it will make a nice footnote in that book you&#39;re writing.  I still sometimes have dreams about being in my office, back at the old schoolhouse.  Sometimes I&#39;m doing paperwork, sometimes I&#39;m talking to someone, but it&#39;s always back behind the desk, just like old times.  But gradually, I notice something&#39;s a bit off.  The bell&#39;s ringing, but I don&#39;t hear anyone in the hallway.  No students hurrying in or out of the classroom, no chatter, no footsteps, nothing but the bell.  And it doesn&#39;t stop.  The crazy thing is that I never notice it&#39;s a dream until then.  I&#39;ve been retired for ten years, but until I notice the bell, I think everything&#39;s normal.  Crazy, isn&#39;t it?

Agent ██████: I think it&#39;s very interesting.  Thank you very much.  If you think of anything else, don&#39;t hesitate to give me a call.

█████: Any time.</textarea></pre>
