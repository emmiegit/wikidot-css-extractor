**Item #:** SCP-3468                                                                                     

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3468 is surrounded by a chain-link fence that is exactly 10 kilometers in circumference and covers the entire perimeter of SCP-3468&#39;s area of effect.  The fence line is to be constructed exclusively of tantalum carbide and hafnium carbide in order to assure stability when under scorching temperatures.  The entire perimeter of the fence line is to be patrolled in its entirety by a minimum of three members of security every two hours.  Under no circumstance are any non-Foundation personnel allowed to enter the 10 kilometer area of effect beyond the fence line.  SCP-3468 is to remain on the &#39;Moderate&#39; setting at all times when not in active testing.  When in active testing, security is to be placed on stand by with rapid response teams readied and equipped with fire prevention equipment.

  All SCP Foundation personnel are required to wear fire retardant suits during active testing and are only permitted to remove them when further than 15 kilometers away from SCP-3468.  Any non-Foundation personnel attempting to enter SCP-3468&#39;s enclosure are to be turned away under the premise of clean up of the Fort McMurray wildfire.  If any non-personnel individuals continue to persist they should be detained and questioned.
 
**Description:** SCP-3468 is a metallic road sign located southwest of Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada.  SCP-3468&#39;s front contains a half circle segmented into four separate quadrants marked from left to right as &#39;Low&#39;, &#39;Moderate&#39;, &#39;High&#39; and &#39;Extreme&#39;.  The front of the sign appears to be facing the entrance path to Twohorn Trails park.  Upon first inspection, SCP-3468 is visibly indistinguishable to all other Wildfire Warning signs in the Fort McMurray area.  Following detailed analysis of SCP-3468 and its components, it was discovered that instead of the plastic pointer that similar Wildfire Warning signs in the area used, SCP-3468&#39;s pointer was replaced with a replica pointer of a wooden construction.  The replica pointer shows no visible variation from any similar Wildfire Warning signs.  

When the pointer on SCP-3468 is moved to any quadrant not marked as &#39;Moderate&#39;, the environment in a 10 kilometer radius around SCP-3468 will begin to alter itself to match the marking to which the pointer is now pointing.  SCP-3468 when placed on the &#39;Low&#39; and &#39;High&#39; setting will result in the average temperature and weather patterns in SCP-3468&#39;s area of effect matching regional April and August respectively.  When placed on &#39;Moderate&#39; SCP- 3468 will cease all anomalous activity and enter a docile state.  Temperatures inside of  SCP-3468&#39;s area of effect will attain no abnormal weather patterns during this time.  When SCP-3468&#39;s pointer is placed on the &#39;Extreme&#39; quadrant, a similar series of changes as to the &#39;High&#39; setting takes place.  When the effective climax of the environmental change is in place, a small fire of a light green coloration will begin directly below SCP-3468 continue to burn rapidly in the dry and hot conditions.

The flame, known as SCP-3468-1, reacts similarly to a standard flame except when in contact with any living organism.  After contact with a living organism is made, SCP-3468-1 will begin to consume it until no living matter remains on said organism.  SCP-3468-1 is capable of fully consuming the human body in approximately ██ seconds.  SCP-3468-1 can not be extinguished when inside of SCP-3468 area of effect by any known means. If left uncontained, SCP-3468-1 is capable of spreading beyond the 10 kilometer area of effect and continue to burn and travel outwards and away from SCP-3468.  After SCP-3468-1 leaves SCP-3468&#39;s 10 kilometer area of effect, the flame will lose its unique coloration and anomalous abilities.  Wildfires created by SCP-3468 will only stop when all available fuel sources inside of SCP-3468&#39;s area of effect are destroyed. Testing has been inconclusive as to if SCP-3468-1 is sentient.

 SCP-3468 shows a full immunity to heat and fire damage with the ability to withstand temperatures beyond the point of melting steel while retaining no damage to any of its components or paint.  SCP-3468 is inactive between the months of December, January and February and all changes of the positioning of SCP-3468&#39;s pointer create no environmental changes.  Investigation of the Department of Fire Safety in [REDACTED] revealed that SCP-3468 was originally placed in its current position in ██/██/20██.  SCP-3468 has only ever been maintained once, with the problem being cited as &#39;Vandalism: Missing Pointer&#39;.  The name of the individual sent to repair SCP-3468 is not listed on any form of government documentation.  Cross analysis with known anomalous individuals and groups is currently under way.

**Addendum:** SCP-3468 was ordered to be relocated to Site-45 for active testing away from the general public.  However, when Agent [REDACTED](KIA) attempted to remove SCP-3468 from its affixed position SCP-3468 began to vibrate rapidly before exploding into a ball of fire with the approximate temperature of 1200°C.  SCP-3468 then began to rapidly pump super-heated steam out of its post which began to push outwards towards the 10 kilometer limit of SCP-3468 radius of effect and into Foundation research camps nearby. This repeated for twelve hours before SCP-3468 returned to its docile state, leading to ██ casualties and ██ confirmed dead, for the full casualty list view Incident Report 3468-██/██/20██.  Attempts to remove via robots or mechanical methods have so far been met with failure due to the inability of Foundation machinery to operate under such high temperatures.

//Over the course of the last two months we&#39;ve been able to break down the events leading up to the Fort McMurray Wildfires and discover an individual we suspect is responsible for the maintenance of and possible anomalous properties of SCP-3468.  Below I&#39;ve attached three interviews from individuals who had close connections to SCP-3468 and its origins and I suspect that we&#39;re not dealing with any rogue individual, but a violent, radical Eco terrorist group.

&gt; **Interviewed:** Andrew Mclaughlin
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Researcher Burnett.
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** SCP-3468 was discovered by Captain Andrew McLaughlin of the  Janvier Central Firestation after responding to the Fort McMurray Wildfire in ██/██/20██.  The following is a recording of an interview between Captain Andrew McLaughlin and Researcher Burnett.
&gt; 
&gt;  **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Andrew McLaughlin:** You want me to talk into this thing? (sounds of shuffling as he moves himself closer to the recorder) umm... Hello? Ooooh! There&#39;s an echo!
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Burnett:** (sigh) Focus, Mr. McLaughlin, we need your undivided attention.  Now, state your name and occupation for the record.
&gt; 
&gt; **Andrew McLaughlin:** Oh, sorry, uh... McLaughlin, Andrew.  Station Captain of the Janvier Central Firestation.
&gt;  
&gt; **Researcher Burnett:** Can you describe why you and your men were in Twohorn Trails park on the ██/██/20██?
&gt; 
&gt; **Andrew McLaughlin:** Well, we were sent in to help out at Fort McMurray, things were pretty bad over there, people fleeing from their homes, entire forests burning down, it was like hell on Earth.  So basically it was like my Mother-in-laws house! (Break out laughing)
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Burnett:** Please, Mr. McLaughlin, focus.
&gt; 
&gt; **Andrew McLaughlin:** Yeah, sorry, so anyway, when the damn thing finally stopped, we began to move into  Fort McMurray, and when we got into Twohorn Trail, it was like walking into an oven.  Seriously! It was like, what, twenty-five degrees out in Fort McMurray, right?
&gt;We walk into this park and its suddenly like forty degrees!  Not like it mattered though, we just kept on pushing through, even if we were sweating our fucking balls off.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Burnett:** When did you come across SCP-3468?
&gt; 
&gt; **Andrew McLaughlin:** SCP? Sorry pal, I don&#39;t do drugs.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Burnett:** No, not-! (Interviewer stops, takes a deep breath) The sign.  When did you find the sign?
&gt; 
&gt; **Andrew McLaughlin:** A si-Oh! That sign!  Yeah, Christ did that thing ever send me and my boys for a loop!  So, yeah, were walking through whats left of this park, right? Everything, and I mean everything was pitch black with ash, and then suddenly, like a fucking angel from the heavens, a goddamn multicolored sign, sitting in a burnt out forest area, warning people not to start Wildfires. It was, like, the worlds cruelest joke! (Begins to laugh hysterically)
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Burnett:** Focus, Mr. Mclaughlin, Focus.  Did you and your men go investigate the sign?
&gt; 
&gt; **Andrew McLaughlin:** Yeah, sure as hell we did!  It was set to &#39;Extreme&#39; just to add insult to injury, but the damnedest thing is that there was still a small fire burning down under the bloody thing.  Not a large flame, but big enough to be a threat, so I try to stomp it out, but the damn thing doesn&#39;t give, so I put my fire extinguisher up to the job, and it still doesn&#39;t give!  so one of my guys, a fellow named Sims, thinks that maybe it&#39;s getting fuel of something below the surface, so he grabs his fire axe and as he&#39;s raising it up to swing down on the flame, but he bumps into the pointing thingy on the sign and knocks it to... uhh, the yellow side whatever that is, and the fire just disperses, gone before we could even touch it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Burnett:** Interesting.  Did you do anything else to the sign?  Meddle with it, damage it, anything?
&gt; 
&gt; **Andrew McLaughlin:** Nope, we called it in and made our way back, not long after you guys show up, and here we are now.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Burnett:** Well, thank you for your time, Mr. McLaughlin.
&gt; 
&gt; **Andrew McLaughlin:** My pleasure, hey, you guys got any liquor around here?

&gt; **Interviewed:** Peter Naylor
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Researcher Burnett
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Peter Naylor is the head of the Department of Fire Safety in Fort McMurray and responsible for the upkeep of all Government regulated signs in the Fort McMurray area.  The following is an interview between Peter Naylor and Researcher Burnett aimed at discovering the identity of the individual who maintained SCP-3468. 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Burnett:**  Can you state your name and occupation for the record?
&gt; 
&gt; **Peter Naylor:** Sure can. Peter Naylor, head of the Department of Fire Safety at [REDACTED].
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Burnett:** Can you describe your relation with this sign? (Hands photo of SCP-3468 to Mr. Naylor)
&gt; 
&gt; **Peter Naylor:** (Glances at photo and passes it between his hands for a moment) Hmm, son, you&#39;re gonna have to be a little more specific than that, we have a bakers dozen of these signs scattered all over the damn place.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Burnett:** This particular sign is located near the entrance path to Twohorn Trails park.
&gt; 
&gt; **Peter Naylor:** (Inaudible) ...Trails park... Oh!  Yeah, that sign, it was one tough sonovabitch, probably burned to a crisp now though, hmm, anyway, not much to say to my relationship with it other then I saw it one bloody time.  Although, there was that one time that I assigned Greg&#39;s kid to deal with some vandalism on it or something.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Burnett:** Can you tell me anymore about the individual you assigned to maintain it?  A name, possibly an address?
&gt; 
&gt; **Peter Naylor:** No, not much else I can say on the kid, that was the only job he did for us, and he was damn adamant that he would be the one to do it.  I dunno though, he was one of those &#34;God of Green&#34; or whatever nuts.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Burnett:** Interesting, what can you tell me about this &#39;God of Green&#39; group?
&gt; 
&gt; **Peter Naylor:** Other than that they would come and raise hell at my office every time we tried to cut down a single fucking tree, not much, but my buddy Greg Thuss&#39; son would know, him being a member and all that.  Not sure he would be willing to talk to any of you government type folk, but I&#39;m sure you can persuade him.  He lives down on [REDACTED] Street, big red house, can&#39;t miss it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Burnett:** (Stands up from recording table) Thank you for your time Mr. Naylor, this information is very helpful.
&gt; 
&gt; **Peter Naylor:** Ain&#39;t no problem, and hey, if you&#39;re thinking of going to see the Thuss&#39;, tell Greg that Peter says hi.

&gt; **Interviewed:** James Thuss
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Researcher Burnett
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** James Thuss is a suspected member of a possibly anomalous group that up until this point has been referred to as &#39;God of Green&#39;, the following interview between James Thuss and Researcher Burnett is focusing on the validity of his suspected involvement in &#39;God of Green&#39; and SCP-3468.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt;  
&gt; **Researcher Burnett:** Can I get a name and occupation for the record?
&gt; 
&gt; **James Thuss:** Follower James Thuss, apostle and devotee of The Green Hand of God.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Burnett:** &#39;The Green Hand of God&#39;?  Up until this point we believed your group was know as &#39;God of Green&#39;.
&gt; 
&gt; **James Thuss:** Well, to assume makes an ass out of you and me, Mr. Burnett.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Burnett:** I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t remember giving you my name.
&gt; 
&gt; **James Thuss:** Word travels fast in small towns, Mr. Burnett. Apologies if you find it a tad off putting.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Burnett:** It&#39;s fine, now, what can you tell me about the- (Interviewer is interrupted by James Thuss)
&gt; 
&gt; **James Thuss:** The Sign of the Times.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Burnett:** I beg your pardon?
&gt; 
&gt; **James Thuss:** It was a gift from the Green Father, a simple wooden pointer with the ability to connect a basic fire prevention sign with the heights of the sky and the magma of the Earth&#39;s crust.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Burnett:** How did you attain such an object?
&gt; 
&gt; **James Thuss:** (Raises his hands and cups his palms)  The Green Father himself gave it to me. His use for both the gift and me were quite clear, for both myself and The Sign of the Times have the same purpose.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Burnett:** You are very, umm, forthcoming with this information, Mr. Thuss, are you not afraid of any possible retaliation from your organization?
&gt; 
&gt;  **James Thuss:** No, I know that when I leave this world to enter into the embrace of the Green Father, another loyal member will take my place, for I am not a messenger.  I am a warning.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Burnett:** Say again?
&gt; 
&gt; **James Thuss:** (Stands up, reaches into his pants pocket and pull out a small wooden box and hold it above his head) May The Green Hand of God guide me and watch over me as I burn! (Crushes the small wooden box and is engulfed in bright green flames)
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Burnett:** (Gets up from chair and backs away to the door) Holy fucking shit!  Hey, someone help me out in here!
