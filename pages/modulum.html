**modulum.aic** is an advanced artificial intelligence developed by the Foundation and deployed within the SCiPNet database. Its primary purpose is to quickly and accurately compile SCP reports as part of an experimental program being tested by the Artificial Intelligence Applications Division. The end goal of this project is to ascertain whether artificial intelligence can in fact take over the job of writing SCP documentation.

Staff complaints about the consequences of automation are to be directed to the Human Resources department.

After an extended period of field testing, it has been observed that modulum.aic has undertaken a vast amount of unexplained and unprogrammed behaviors outside of its instructions to write SCP documentation. Further investigation is under review.

Below is a complete transcript of files related to modulum.aic.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ A ghost story with the world at stake.&#34; hide=&#34;- Close Commentary&#34;]]
This was my first SCP, and it took me a total of 9 months to make. Admittedly, it&#39;s a pretty bonkers concept - every single person that has ever died manipulating brains to cause intrusive thoughts and eventually mass anarchy. In fact, this was originally a short story I wrote long before getting into SCP that I decided I would adapt to the SCP format once I joined; I joined the wiki //specifically// to write this thing. 

In a sense, this article kinda comes from a dark place. It&#39;s about explaining the origin of the &#34;call of the void,&#34; the random impulse that makes us consider what it would be like to jump off a high ledge or harm someone else. A lot of the philosophical ideas in it come from a deeply cynical examination of human nature, as well as playing on our hopes and fears of what comes with death. It stemmed from my own paranoia about what I was capable of, and my grappling with ideas of free will and power over others.

You will notice this article uses a lot of (a) crosslinks and (b) format screws. Over the 9 months of this article&#39;s creation, I wanted to make it as perfect as possible - as refined and neatly constructed as I could humanly make it. I read so many SCPs that many of their ideas and lore crossed over into mine as inspiration; so much so that in the end SCP-3675&#39;s kinda a composite of themes introduced in a lot of other works.

Looking back on it, I&#39;m not too proud of 3675; it&#39;s very melodramatic, and leans on some narrative crutches. But I&#39;m happy with its existence. Everything in it is deeply genuine and personal.

This was originally an entry into the Doomsday Contest, where I was working with Yossi, BlazingTrail, and TheeSherm. I had been playing with an SCP idea about the reason for us not being contacted by any alien life was that everyone else had been eradicated by some common force. We built it into a massive storyline involving pattern screamers and cosmic horror and the philosophy of knowledge, and this is the first installment in that. Really, it&#39;s more of a trailer. It sets up a mystery and promises an explanation (that explanation is, as of this writing, still coming!). 

This is currently my most successful SCP, and it was also an absolute blast to write. I loved coming up with all of the ways different extraterrestrial planets were fucked up, and writing the exploration logs and recovered material helped me try dipping into a lot of different styles.

The Collaboration Contest was a challenging time and my partner Sterbai and I had to pull off some pretty grueling work - but we made it. I think we created a story that fuses both of our respective writing styles and common themes together. While the GoI format took more than a week to write, this took about 12 hours (mainly because of time limits). As such, it&#39;s a pretty short and moody piece, relying less on overt explanation and more on generating a lingering feeling of the legacy of mistakes and disasters.

Both Sterbai and I watched the Chernobyl miniseries and loved it. We ended up writing something obviously influenced by it, about GRU-P falling victim to convenient lies and corner-cutting bureaucracy that ended in utter disaster, just as in Chernobyl.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Art! What is it good for?&#34; hide=&#34;- Close Commentary&#34;]]
So yeah, this is a true exquisite corpse - every section written using only the last line of the previous. I adore this piece - its incoherency, its clunkiness, its complete lack of any intended story - because it feels like a celebration of the writing process itself. I got to work with some of my very best friends, all of whom are extremely talented writers but in very distinct and unique ways. 

I also really enjoyed writing my sections of the corpse, and both contain what I consider to be some of my best writing. The first is the beginning part of Incident 5633-1, a segment that retroactively justifies the existence of the article through a time travel accident; the second is what I&#39;ve seen to be the most celebrated part of the article, the blood-demanding experiment logs. These were inspired by listening to a lot of industrial music and stealing a few motifs from Roko&#39;s basilisk, but they leave just enough in the dark to point at a possibility without explicitly telling you how or why it got there. Basically, I popped the fuck off on this article.

The final product is something that I&#39;m proud to have contributed to, a kind of shifting Rorschach test of an article, an impressionistic work of abstraction that coaxes the reader into trying to put together a meaning from pieces of disparate evidence, directly involving themselves in the article&#39;s content. It&#39;s a beautifully dark work of mood and aesthetic that really and truly deserves its place on the site.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ lots to say about this one&#34; hide=&#34;- Close Commentary&#34;]]
I entered 6kcon as a bit.

No, I&#39;m not exaggerating - while I had been weighing whether I should enter for nearly the whole time, what finally pushed me over the edge was my desire to come back from a long Twitter break by doing some kind of massive hype announcement underneath a random tweet, Death Grips-style - and [https://twitter.com/modulum83/status/1397672139432595461 that&#39;s exactly what I did]. With my release date announced, I was now bound to keep my promise, and hell if I wouldn&#39;t make sure it was kept.

My ideas tend to gestate through trial and error over the course of months, followed by a frenzy of converting it into plot through employing a bunch of tricks I keep up my sleeve when the time comes to write it. This is a pretty standard case study of that. It started out as a kernel of an idea, about a second Earth lost deep in the galaxy, but the real thing that kicked it off was the release of the Avalanches&#39; 2020 album, //We Will Always Love You.// There&#39;s a certain earnest sincerity and embrace of emotion and feeling above all else that I found super affecting, and its motifs of outer space as connecting to music, light, love, and other spiritual concepts made it a logical fit for my initial starting image. The album is a massive looming influence over the entirety of On Golden Skies (which is named after a track, &#34;Gold Sky&#34;). Its big themes are pivotal to the work, and I even quote little bits of imagery and turns of phrase from the lyrics throughout. I can&#39;t overstate how much this album //made// this piece - the two are nearly inseparable.

The other ingredient that motivated my writing was my desire to see my development hell-stuck canon, Shattered Thoughts, continue. But I wanted to be intentional about it - SCP-3426 was a big sleeper hit and created a lot of people&#39;s ideas of what STBM was, but only I knew that its portrayal was really incomplete. I didn&#39;t want STBM to focus solely on eldritch horror and present day pensiveness - I eventually evolved the canon in my mind to a much more futuristic, hopeful, and fantastical canon, but until now it was still in my mind. So 6100 acts as a true intro to Shattered Thoughts - human stories in a dark universe. The plot followed logically from this soup of motivations: the heavy integration of audio with the spectrogram as the final stinger, the ideas of past versions of humanity reaching out to us, the far-future setting and double-offset trick, the interweaving of a love story with the plot.

And on that last part: this article was also a way to start to step outside of my usual wheelhouse with writing and really be more courageous as a writer. The character study of Andrew Finn&#39;s central to the entire article; it was my goal to truly make something //that// character-driven and really get inside a person&#39;s head. How do you write a complete arc for a character? How do you make them feel real? It&#39;s an ongoing process, but this was a good first step. 

Also, this article came out way more LGBT than I realized, writing it! When I was trying to come up with characters for the ship crew, I was mostly practicing making side characters feel grounded and real even without a lot of space to sketch them out, but apparently the article&#39;s usage of neopronouns and centering of an MLM romance - two qualities I didn&#39;t give a second though to - have made a few people online mad. I don&#39;t plan to stop writing gay stories anytime soon, btw.

Ultimately, while I don&#39;t think this article&#39;s as polished or lightning-in-a-bottle as 3426, it&#39;s definitely a really good re-establishment of my style with writing that&#39;s potent and slickly executed. 6100 was built to be an emotional world of an article, just like the album that inspired it - the comments make me happy that that was exactly how it came out.

The putting together of this article kind of just happened all at once. While I initially had other, solo ideas for Memecon, I eventually decided that they were just too ambitious to do well so soon after 6K. This opportunity - to do media work for an article - was really just what I needed, giving me something to do while recovering from writing burnout. Everything about this was just fun. Elunerazim went all the fuck in on the vocals and the instrumental was so fun to put together. I&#39;m kind of shocked at how well the final product turned out; for how haphazard my methods are and how quickly I did it all in, the song is super fucking clean, from vocals to synths.

Combining GRU-P and the Children of the Night was a weird choice but one that worked out surprisingly well. It&#39;s very fitting to give the GRU-P a faction that they would take advantage of easily, but that still was a force beyond their control that would come back to bite them in the end. We worked hard over this to nail down that good old Soviet government tone, and Nico created a sweet new format for us (Thanks!). This piece is rather daunting for me to wrap my head around, but hey, it survived.

[[/=]]

The making of the r/SCPDeclassified subreddit is my big claim to fame. It&#39;s how I entered the SCP community and it&#39;s still by far the one thing that I can say is my legacy. I created the subreddit in May of 2017 and now, it&#39;s so much more than I&#39;d ever thought it would be. I&#39;m glad I was able to start something that readers and writers alike would find interesting and useful, and I&#39;m quite proud of everything it&#39;s built. Mostly I&#39;m thankful to the contributors, who&#39;ve kept the subreddit (usually) alive.

Some thoughts on the philosophy behind it all: I think that there is 100% a demand for SCP explanations from the readerbase. Clarifying the plot, thematic ideas, and context of works is something that I enjoy and that I do not apologize for. Over time, SCPD has gradually grown to encompass more than that though; literary analysis and authors&#39; choices are now big parts of declassifications. In the end, I hope r/SCPDeclassified is a way for the appreciation of ambitious writing to become more widespread and prominent. I want to enrich the experiences of readers who might not know that there is indeed a lot to find in SCPs, and to provide a way for writers to explain their writing through AMAs and self-declasses.

++ Declassifications
I have written a total of 31 explanation pieces so far.

I remember where I was when I first learned that Day had Broke. I felt that a gap in my heart had been fulfilled, a deep longing for good writing had been completed once and for all. I felt like I had witnessed the birth of God. I gazed at its elegant prosal beauty, wondered at its grotesque, existential horror, and marveled at its deep, apocalyptic detail. And as I read this magnificent piece of writing, I understood one thing:

//I can make memes out of this.//

Forget the sheaves of paper, the gate guardians, the vinyl records, the spiral paths, and the factories. Forget imaginary occult wars, blind spots upon the gaze of God, 36 angels that could bring quiet days, a planet of Hands long forgotten. No, When Day Breaks is the ultimate culmination of an SCP, because of one reason:

//I can make memes out of this.//

And so I did. I flooded /r/DankMemesFromSite19 with my clever, witty, and original funny captions and images, talking about how Day had bROKE and we were all going to die and become fREE. Each new meme, posted an average of every 6 hours, added something new and unique to the conversation, something hilariously funny and topical and not at all rather stale and trite. I saw the heartbreaking story told within its prose, the deep detail about the slow death of the Foundation, and the frighteningly complex way the flesh creations were described, and I ignored it all, distracted by one thought alone:

//I can make memes out of this.//

All glory to When Day Breaks. All glory to Shaggydredlocks. All glory to the memes.

The writing is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of postmodern horror most of the narratives will go over a typical readers head. There&#39;s also Series IV&#39;s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into the articles - the format screws draw heavily from Jack Ike&#39;s bibliography, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these SCPs, to realise that they&#39;re not just scary - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Series IV truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn&#39;t appreciate, for instance, the horror in SCP-3001&#39;s poignant catchphrase &#34;ANNA, GIVE ME YOUR BRAIN, I ONLY HAVE HALF,&#34; which itself is a cryptic reference to djkaktus&#39;s modern epic SCP-1730. I&#39;m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as the SCP Wiki&#39;s genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. ðŸ˜‚

And yes, by the way, i DO have an SCP-3545 tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It&#39;s for the admins&#39; eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that their articles are within 5 upvotes of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ðŸ˜Ž
