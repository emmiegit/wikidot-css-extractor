]]
**Special Containment Procedures:** An array of Foundation-owned satellites surround SCP-5609 at all times, and are programmed to constantly project a selectively antimemetic field around the object to prevent its viewing by civilians. Unmanned research probe SCPS //Spearhead// has been landed on SCP-5609, and is currently being used to collect its tissue samples and take vital readings. Any changes in the orbital pattern of SCP-5609 are to be monitored, and circumvented via movement of the satellite array.
 
**Description:** SCP-5609 is a massive (230 km in diameter), bioluminescent, spherical organism, currently in orbit 30,000 km above the earth&#39;s surface. SCP-5609 constantly emits yellow light, and upon cursory observation resembles a small moon.
 
Close-up inspection of SCP-5609 have shown it to possess features similar to those of some beetle larvae, such as a small, discolored head with two compound eyes and two short mandibles; two visible legs protruding from underneath its head; and soft, segmented skin.
 
**Addendum: Recovered Data**
 
The following is a list of data pertaining to SCP-5609, collected by SCPS //Spearhead.//
 
* SCP-5609 moves periodically; however, such motion consists of not much more than momentary twitching of its legs and mandibles.
* SCP-5609 lacks the ability to steer and propel its body through space. Its orbit is entirely passive.
* The metabolism of SCP-5609 is hypothesized to be up to 3,000 times slower than that of any terrestrial insect.
* The presence of spiracles[[footnote]]Breathing organs found on terrestrial insects[[/footnote]] on the body of SCP-5609 indicate that it is not biologically suited for survival in a vacuum.
* A section of skin on the back of SCP-5609 protrudes from the organism, as if being pulled.

**Addendum: Incident Log**
 
On March 22, 2021, SCP-5609 disappeared, along with SCPS //Spearhead//. The anomaly was reclassified as Neutralized after an extensive search of the area of outer space surrounding Earth found no trace of it.
 
One month later, SCPS //Spearhead// re-appeared in high Earth orbit and immediately fell through the atmosphere. Despite sustaining heavy damage upon crash-landing, the following audio log remained intact.
 
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
//(Heavy static is audible, but dissipates after 7 seconds. Upon its dissipation, two voices are heard.)//
 
**Unknown-1:** Hoooooo-eeee! Now //this// one&#39;s bound to be a doozy.
 
**Unknown-2:** Can&#39;t believe they bit. Oh, we&#39;ll sure be eatin&#39; well tonight!
 
//(After a few moments, the voices become louder. The recording distorts slightly as a result.)//
 
**Unknown-2:** Hey, Willie? Uh... you gotta see this.
 
**Unknown-1:** What the- awwwww, c&#39;mon, not this //again.//
 
**Unknown-2:** What is it?
 
**Unknown-1:** Oh, just another one of those shiny bugs. Toss it back in.
 
**Unknown-2:** Could I keep it? It looks pretty cool.
 
**Unknown-1:** //(Audibly sighs)// You can&#39;t //eat// cool, Amos.
 
**Unknown-2:** All right, all right, //fine.// //(The sound of rushing air is heard, following by a loud splash. The voices begin to fade.)//
 
**Unknown-1:** ...gotta cast out by the moon next time. I heard tell the folks there&#39;re a bunch more gullible.
 
//(Static becomes audible. The recording ends.)//
[[/div]]
 
The area surrounding the moon is currently being monitored for signs of SCP-5609 re-emergence.
