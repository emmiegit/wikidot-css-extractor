&gt; **Document prepared by:** Doctor Darryl Loyd
&gt; **Date:** 2016-08-04

&gt; [[=]]
&gt;&gt; **WARNING:** The following document contains a Class X Infohazard (Extreme Danger). Memetic Safety Procedures enacted. For personnel with proper clearance, multiple high-intensity memetic countermeasures have been spread randomly throughout the document. Attempting to access this document with improper clearance will result in anti-memetic suppression. Seed: ,,{{lsP28sZuj3iii2}},,
&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; 
&gt; **Item #:** SCP-3002
&gt; 
&gt; **Object Class:** Keter
&gt; 
&gt; **Special Containment Procedures:** All text containing SCP-3002 must be destroyed, aside from official SCP documentation. Access to SCP-3002 documentation is limited to personnel with Level 4/3002 security clearance or higher. Administrator override has been revoked, with the exception of O5 Command and the current director of the Records and Information Security Administration. 
&gt; 
&gt; Procedure Veselka has been updated to include a memetic trigger which can be used to identify affected persons. If an affected person is detected, they are to be sedated using ranged weaponry and collected or terminated. Depending on their prominence or importance, an affected individual may be surgically amnesticized.
&gt; 
&gt; If all memories have been contaminated (or a sufficiently large proportion so as to impede normal functioning following surgery), the affected subject may be terminated with standard Foundation protocols being enacted for concealing their death. All Foundation personnel above Level 3 clearance are to be considered Important Individuals if they are discovered to have been affected. Surgical removal of memories has shown to be the only reliable way to remove SCP-3002 from a person. Pharmaceutical and aerial amnestics have failed to remove the anomaly in all cases since ██/██/2016.
&gt; 
&gt; Any print companies or websites that are actively creating content containing SCP-3002, whether knowingly or not, are to be shut down and their owners terminated. All content they have created is to be destroyed. No testing or interviews may be held concerning SCP-3002, without the express permission of the current project head.[[footnote]] At the time of this writing, the current project head is Dr. Loyd. [[/footnote]] 
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** SCP-3002 is a Class X contagious memetic hazard with wide-ranging effect on the memories of subjects exposed to it. The anomaly can remove, alter, or replace any memory of the subject, and can create new memories in the subject which are not based on the subject&#39;s actual experience. SCP-3002 is capable of affecting declarative memories[[footnote]] Declarative, or explicit memories, are memories involving personal experiences or factual information. [[/footnote]] and implicit memories.[[footnote]] Implicit, or procedural memories, are memories acquired and used unconsciously. Typically referred to as &#34;Muscle memory.&#34; [[/footnote]] Affected subjects identify altered memories as their own, and will behave accordingly. In this way, SCP-3002 has the ability to influence the personalities and actions of subjects.
&gt; 
&gt; The transmission vector for SCP-3002 was originally believed to be the communication of a particular false memory (involving a childhood walk in the woods, an argument with a friend, and an immigrant girl named Lily Veselka). It has since been determined that the communication of any memory by an affected subject can lead to SCP-3002 infection. Communication can be by way of text, speech, electronic correspondence, mathematical formulas, and thought.[[footnote]]In the case of telepathic entities or equipment[[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; While transmission may not include references to the &#34;Lily Veselka&#34; false memory, persons affected by SCP-3002 will generally recall a humanoid female by that name forming part of unrelated memories or experiences. This entity (referred to as SCP-3002-1) is described as having extremely pale blonde hair, appearing anemic,  and being a childhood friend originally from an Eastern European country. In affected memories, SCP-3002-1 is often remembered approaching subjects and asking them questions pertaining to herself or an unspecified project, such as &#34;What do you know about me?&#34; or &#34;Has the project finished?&#34;.
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-3002 has avoided containment by displaying extremely adaptive behavior. Due to its adaptive behavior, it has been theorized that SCP-3002 or SCP-3002-1 may be sapient. Epidemiological studies appear to indicate it is deliberately targeting individuals who create large amounts of information or people who do large amounts of research on Slavic or eastern European history and geography.
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-3002 was originally discovered in 2014, when a prison psychologist reported that a large number of inmates appeared to have extremely similar memories regarding a specific day from their childhoods. When initially contained, it was believed the anomaly was a simple shared memory; however, further research has revealed additional effects not present or not noticed during initial containment. Due to SCP-3002&#39;s unknown effects at the time, it is believed that much of the prison staff was contaminated by the anomaly, and are currently unknowingly acting as vectors to spread it. While specific data is still being gathered, it is suspected much of the population of the mid-West USA has been exposed to SCP-3002.
&gt; 
&gt; **Addendum 3002-4:** Approximately four months after conducting Interview 3002-3, RAISA Officer Whitley lost control of their vehicle during a vacation that they scheduled following the previous interview.  While not fatal, Officer Whitley did suffer severe spinal injuries. A RAISA Official who initially spoke to Whitley regarding the incident noted their unusual behavior, and correlated it back to the known effects of SCP-3002. Following this, Doctor Loyd was contacted to conduct an interview with Whitley. 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //Dr. Loyd enters RAISA Officer Whitley&#39;s room in Medical Site-923, and activates a physical memetic countermeasure, designed as part of Project Veselka.//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Whitley:** Doctor Loyd. It is a pleasure to see you. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Dr. Loyd:** Likewise, Whit. Are they treating you well here? Comfortable? Food decent? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Whitley:** Yes, yes, and I&#39;d rather not say. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Dr. Loyd:** //(Loyd claps his hands together.)// So, Jen told me you&#39;ve been a bit under the weather, in regards to your... //(Loyd makes a motion, pointing to his head.)//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Whitley:** To my knowledge, no. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Dr. Loyd:** Right, uh, so you remember a few weeks ago you talked to Vanderbilt about Lily, er, SCP-3002. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Whitley:** Oh, yes. I apologize, my injury has caused my memory to be less than reliable lately. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Dr. Loyd:** Do you remember, sometime in your past or childhood, meeting a girl by the name of Lily Veselka? Think closely, she doesn&#39;t like to be thought about when she doesn&#39;t want to be. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Whitley:** I cannot recall anyone by that name.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Dr. Loyd:** //(Sighs)// Alright, let&#39;s shift focus. Your recent actions have been strange, unnatural.  What have you done recently, why did you go on vacation? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Whitley:** For some time, I had felt a mild compulsion to do research on a particular topic, specifically within Foundation files and knowledge-bases. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Dr. Loyd:** Did you act on that urge at all, Whit? I need to know. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Whitley:** Negative, doctor. I recognized the possible presence of a harmful meme, and took the proper countermeasures to remove it. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Dr. Loyd:** //(Frowns)// Is that all? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Whitley:** No, once I had the threat properly removed I performed this research on my own volition, to satisfy my own curiosity. I found several mentions of an entity similar to SCP-3002 and a certain project working under the title Lethe.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Dr. Loyd:** Yes, but what did you find, Whit? I don&#39;t have all day. What did you learn about Lily? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Whitley:** I would rather not say. My vehicular collision was not an accident, despite security footage showing otherwise. I was pressured off the road by the sudden acts of three otherwise unrelated vehicles, working in tandem. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Dr. Loyd:** Whitley, this is your last chance to answer. I believe you are contaminated by SCP-3002 and are deliberately withholding information to interfere with research. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Whitley:** Doctor Loyd, I do not adequately feel I can trust you. I apologize, but I do not feel I would like to continue this interview. //(Whitley was unresponsive to all other questions.)//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; It was determined RAISA Officer Whitley had been affected by SCP-3002 since their interaction with Dr. Vanderbilt. Due to the disruption and danger Whitley posed to the Foundation and SCP-3002, they were recommended for termination. Termination was carried out on ██/██/2016 by the use of lethal injection. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Exploration Log 3002-5:** Following information extracted from [REDACTED], agents were dispatched to the Uzhanskyi National park on the western edge of Ukraine. Agents discovered a ruined, subterranean research facility, that appeared to have been abandoned since 2013. Markings and documents found in the facility indicate it was associated with the Foundation. No record of a facility in this location exists in Ukrainian or Foundation records.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite the general condition of the facility indicating a long period of abandonment, there was some evidence of recent activity. Large amounts of documents and papers were found burnt and several computers were found to be missing memory and storage devices. One of the facility&#39;s furnaces was discovered to have been activated shortly before the agents&#39; arrival. The ashes inside were later analyzed and determined to contain traces of human DNA matching SCP-███.
&gt; 
&gt; While searching through the facility, agents discovered an office area with several piles of burnt documents. One document was found in a readable state, following chemical treatment.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Veles,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I do not believe continuing active work on Project Lethe is a productive use of our resources. While Lethe has been an invaluable tool for averting Broken Masquerade type scenarios, having the project rely on a single anomaly has been causing undue stress in the subject. She has been displaying decreasingly less motor and cognitive function, which may be a consequence of the invasive equipment being used for the procedure. As an example of her cognitive deterioration, she does not respond or register her previous name or designation. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; In addition to that, she has been becoming increasingly less willing to work with the technicians, to the point of resorting to self harm in attempts to avoid the procedures. At the current moment, she is under constant observation due to the fact that she attempted suicide several days ago. We&#39;re not entirely sure how, but it is currently believed she hid a dining utensil during a meal, and sharpened it over the next few weeks. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; We have previously attempted to avoid this type of emotional distress by letting her participate in the various hobbies or activities she enjoyed prior to containment, such as photography and reading.  
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; With all that said, I do believe a controllable mass amnestic or memory altering anomaly is practical in the event of a Broken Masquerade scenario, so continuing research and development in this field would be wise. As we know for a fact that the memetic trigger used in Lethe is present in all but a negligible amount of the population, perhaps we could alter it to give us further control over their memories, instead of acting as an anchoring point for our subject. Since we&#39;ve included the trigger with the neural archetype scans from Yellowstone, a procedure that is not reliant on a human subject would allow for continued use past the lifespan of our current subject.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; - Perun
&gt;  
&gt; While investigating the facility, agents discovered a surgical theater fitted with equipment used for invasive neurosurgery. Medical documents and restraints found in the room indicate the subject or subjects operated in this location were conscious during the length of the procedures. Wear on the equipment indicates frequent usage.
