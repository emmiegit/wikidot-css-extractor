**Quintus55 posted:**

So a lot has been going on in my world lately, and I know a lot of things I shouldn&#39;t, and I honestly don&#39;t know what to make of it, so big surprise, I decided to write a song about it. While this is inspired by true things(ish) I&#39;ve embellished the story. And in any case I&#39;d appreciate you not reading too much into it and enjoying the song as is.

I&#39;ve had a hard time coming up with a name for this one, too. I originally thought &#34;More than meets the eye&#34; but then I hated that so... I still don&#39;t know. Maybe let me know if you have suggestions?

As always, lyrics in the read more. Thanks for listening!

++++ Verse 1
Jesters and Jailers
Attend to and tailor
The tale of war underfoot
The cogheads and serpents
Towards battle aren&#39;t certain
They know that it all ends in soot

While seeking protection
They build their collection
A weapon unmatched by machine
The first stone is cast
But the one who laughs last
Is the distant pedestrian queen

++++ Prechorus 1
There&#39;s more than meets the eye to what&#39;s begun
Although she&#39;s standing last, she has not won

++++ Chorus
They say that all&#39;s fair in-- 
That anything goes
And what are they fighting for?
Nobody knows
So we&#39;re doomed to watch
Or to fight I suppose
While hand, cog, and flesh come to blows

++++ Verse 2
The jesters in court
Have a secret of sorts
That was stolen while under her watch
They didn&#39;t begin it
But once caught up in it
They left to take things down a notch

They have no excuse
But they value its use
So they keep it from all those involved
Their weapon stays hidden
The war stays unbidden
Their guilt they&#39;ve completely absolved

++++ Prechorus 2
There&#39;s more than meets the eye to what goes down
The jesters are not fools; they wear the crown

++++ Chorus
They say that all&#39;s fair in-- 
That anything goes
And what are they fighting for?
Nobody knows
So we&#39;re doomed to watch
Or to fight I suppose
While hand, cog, and flesh come to blows

++++ Verse 3
The jailers, meanwhile
In truth or denial
Acquired a threat of their own
Though quite the detectives
They seem ineffective
At working out truths not yet shown

They don&#39;t understand
But reach out to the hand
And demand their compliance for aid
The snakes don&#39;t comply
So the jailers sit by
And they never realize they&#39;ve been played

++++ Prechorus 3
There&#39;s more than meets the eye to what goes on
The jailers are not rooks, they are the pawn

++++ Chorus
They say that all&#39;s fair in-- 
That anything goes
And what are they fighting for?
Nobody knows
So we&#39;re doomed to watch
Or to fight I suppose
While hand, cog, and flesh come to blows

++++ Bridge
The jailers out of the way
The war becomes too hard
The jesters fail to see
They are the wild card
Machine and Serpent joined
Decide to finally bombard
The battlefield&#39;s left empty
The earth, forever scarred

++++ Verse 4
Jesters and Jailers
Attend to and tailor
The tale of war that has passed
The latter derisive,
The fools indecisive
You both must take blame for the blast

While you sit there writing
There&#39;s wars that need fighting
The heroes have ended their scene
Though they paid the cost
Not all hope is lost
To defeat the pedestrian queen

++++ Prechorus 3
There&#39;s more than meets the eye to what lies ahead
Though she&#39;s still standing tall her army is dead
And one more final secret that I&#39;ve found
If you combined your power you&#39;d take her down

++++ Chorus
They say that all&#39;s fair in-- 
That anything goes
And what is it all for?
Well, nobody knows
Are we doomed to watch
And to stay writing prose?
There&#39;s a time we must all come to blows

No, nothing&#39;s quite fair here
But anything goes
There&#39;s dangerous people
We all must oppose
Will they join the fight?
We&#39;ll see, I suppose
If jailers and jesters
The betters and lessers
Together, &#39;gainst flesh come to blows

Honestly, I think &#34;More than meets the eye&#34; is a fine name. You clearly haven&#39;t told us all that&#39;s going on, and that title encompasses that. Great song, dude!

I love the imagery in here! The lyrics are so dark. Have you considered &#34;Coming To Blows&#34; as a title? Or maybe &#34;Jesters and Jailers&#34;? Either way, excellent job.

Good song! Kinda sad though. I hope things get resolved with whatever it is you&#39;re going through.

I liked the song, but what the actual fuck is the file name implying?
