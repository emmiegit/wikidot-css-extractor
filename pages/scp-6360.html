**Special Containment Procedures:** 
The wilderness of the Carpathian Mountain range is to be designated as natural parks under the pretext of preserving endangered flora and fauna species. Foundation personnel will operate in the area under the guise of scientists and conservationists studying the local wildlife.

Foundation assets are to set up perimeters around the areas surrounding several cave entrances in the Carpathians and Ukraine to prohibit trespassers. These are to be covered up as strict nature reserves or military grounds.

Radar units and surface-to-air missile (SAM) batteries are to be set up in strategic positions along the range. SAMs are to utilise electro-optical and laser guidance systems. The former will be used for tracking and the latter should only be used if SCP-6360 attempts to leave the mountain range. Satellite imaging will also be used to provide surveillance with a 0.1 second delay.

At least 1 squadron of fighters, preferably air superiority and/or interceptor aircraft are to be kept on stand-by at airbases in the vicinity of the Carpathians. These aircraft are to be assisted by AWACS as well as air defence systems on the ground, and equipped with electro-optical and laser beam riding anti-aircraft missiles (AAMs).

Personnel carrying out tasks away from research stations must wear [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/incident-096-1-a SCRAMBLE] v2 goggles at all times. In the case of goggles malfunctioning, personnel are to immediately make their way back to base. An MTF battalion is to be based in the territories surrounding the mountain range to rescue jeopardised personnel. Remote cameras are to be used to monitor SCP-6360. Any live video surveillance in the containment zone must also have the stated 0.1 second delay in their feed.

**Description:**
SCP-6360 is a large chimeric organism measuring an average of 7.6 metres in length and possessing both reptilian and ornithic traits. It stands approximately 2.5 metres tall, featuring winged forelimbs, with a wingspan of 9.1 metres, and reptilian hindlimbs along with a long, muscular tail  covered in foldable rectrices.[[footnote]] The larger feathers in a bird&#39;s tail, used for steering in flight.[[/footnote]] The head of SCP-6360 strongly resembles non-anomalous Bearded vultures (//Gypaetus barbatus//) but possesses rows of sharp curved teeth and two venomous fangs.

SCP-6360’s venom is extremely potent, possessing both neurotoxic and cytotoxic properties. Any organism in contact with the venom, via directly getting bitten by SCP-6360 or indirectly through touching or contamination will result in death within 2 minutes. Effects on human subjects include a loss of coordination, delirium, accelerated lysis, paralysis, and asphyxia, leading to death. Corpses of victims will appear withered with massive internal injuries.

Its eyes are similar to those of the King cobra (//Ophiophagus hannah//). When SCP-6360 makes eye contact with an individual, the individual will immediately die. Autopsy on those afflicted by SCP-6360’s sight show injuries and effects consistent with those in individuals which have come into contact with SCP-6360’s venom. SCP-6360 is also immune to all known toxins.

SCP-6360 vocalisations are a mix of those produced by Old World vultures and snakes. 

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Withering Events Log&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]

Withering Events refers to any deaths caused by SCP-6360’s venom or eye contact. It has several names within the region, such as в’янення[[footnote]] Romanised: vʺyanennya. Ukrainian for &#34;Withering&#34;) [[/footnote]] , putregaiul [[footnote]] Romanian for &#34;The Rot&#34; [[/footnote]], увенути[[footnote]] Romanised: uvenuti.  Serbian for &#34;Withering&#34;[[/footnote]], otrávení [[footnote]] Czech for &#34;poisoning&#34;, [[/footnote]] as well as others.

Notable events in chronological order:


||~ Dates ||~ Location ||~ Description of  Withering Event ||~ Notes ||
|| 19th September 1916- 1st  December 1916 || Bitola (Monastir),  Macedonia || An estimated over 10000 Allied soldiers died from poisoning. It is inferred that they most likely came into contact with SCP-6360’s venom from a contaminated water supply.  It is unknown how many soldiers of the Central Powers died due to poisonings; however, both sides have reported sightings of SCP-6360 flying around in the night sky. || It is theorised that the events lead to the subsequent victory of the Central Powers as a result of Allied manpower depletion due to sickness ||
|| 26th February – 11th March 1926 || Krakow, Poland || 12 people went missing in the Wolski Forest. 5 of them were found dead in withered states. Reports of SCP-6360, nicknamed “Bazyliszek” by the locals, began coming in. Many locals, believing it was the legendary Warsaw Basilisk, began hanging mirrors outside of their house to make the Basilisk kill itself with its gaze. One particularly interesting incident was on the 3rd March 1926, when 6 people were found dead in the city. It is inferred that the creature had attacked someone and its glare was inadvertently reflected by multiple mirrors.|| “Bazyliszek” is the Polish word for Basilisk.||
|| 18th May 1942 || Ľadový štít, Slovakia || A Gebirgsjäger platoon went missing. 5 years later, the bodies of the soldiers were found on various parts of the mountain by locals. || ||
|| 5th June 1969 || Svydovets,Polonynian Beskids (Ukrainian SSR, USSR) || A group of 8 hunters were found dead in the mountains. || In stark contrast to this incident, there were cases of friendly encounters between the Hutsul[[footnote]]An ethnic group spanning parts of western Ukraine and Romania.[[/footnote]] people and SCP-6360, especially when children were involved.||
|| 29th January 1988 – 9th February 1992 || Pripyat, Ukraine (Ukrainian SSR, USSR) || 7 soldiers and 2 liquidators were found dead in the city.|| The deaths were initially attributed to high levels of radiation. ||
|| 15th July- 1st October 1995 || Ozren, Serbia (Yugoslavia) || An estimated over 100 Serbian soldiers were found dead. Most of the bodies were withered and severely mutilated. 47 were killed in what appeared to be a friendly fire incident, where an artillery unit was supposedly given the order by their commander to stonk[[footnote]]Bombard with concentrated artillery fire.[[/footnote]] a building unbeknownst to them occupied by friendly troops, after receiving a distress call from soldiers claiming they were being pinned down by enemies in the building. || SCP-6360 was suspected to be residing in the mountain before the event when reports of strange snake-like sounds were being emitted from the forests.||
|| 8th May 2000|| Făgăraș Mountains, Romania || Over 30 illegal loggers disappeared in the forests and were found dead days later. 4 of the bodies had multiple fractures and massive haemorrhaging, suggesting they had fallen from a high altitude. || Certain zones have become free of loggers due to fear of SCP-6360, nicknamed by locals as the “Basilisc”.||
|| 1st February 2002 || Moravian-Silesian Region, Czech Republic. || A local shepherd and his friends who were looking for his missing 4-year-old daughter in the forest nearby his home discovered the withered body of Markus Kolář, a traveller in the area. Later that day, the daughter returned home. When asked where she had went, she stated that she was playing with a “dragon”. || The remains of two previously missing local children were found in Kolář’s cabin. Just as with the case of the Hutsuls, SCP-6360 has been recorded to have positive interactions with locals of the mountains.||
|| 6th May 2007 || Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, North of the Pripyat, Ukraine. || A CBRN unit sent to investigate the source of gunshots reported coming from the exclusion zone discovered an entire motorised infantry platoon dead. Post mortem reports detail that 3/4 of the bodies were in states consistent with the effects of SCP-6360‘s poisoning, whereas the rest had severe lacerations and multiple fractured bones. One of the three BMP2 IFVs was found heavily damaged with the hatch broken open and 14m away from the wreckage. || ||

**Addendum 1: Discovery**
Sightings were reported across Europe throughout the 20th Century, with a majority concentrating in the Carpathians and its surrounding area. It is suspected that SCP-6360 sightings cover such a large territory due to the creature’s ability to fly quickly at very high altitudes; and being able to crawl in cave systems and dense forests to cover ground undetected. After a period during which sightings stopped, it was later photographed in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone by soldiers two days after the Chernobyl disaster.[[footnote]] It is not confirmed whether or not SCP-6360 is related to the sightings before the accident of the “Black Bird of Chernobyl”. [[/footnote]] 

SCP-6360 became a very high priority for The Foundation after Incident-6360-1. The Foundation was contacted on behalf of the Ukrainian government in 14th July 2007, after the discovery of a mass Withering Event. MTF Beta-7 &#34;Maz Hatters&#34; were deployed to Ukraine and assets in neighbouring countries were kept on high alert due to SCP-6360 tendency to wander.

SCP-6360 was spotted in the Polissya hotel in Pripyat by Beta-7 following the radio signal of the missing Ukrainian CBRN team. After a sweep of the building, the team found the bodies of four of the missing personnel, all partially consumed. Further investigation lead to the discovery of what appeared to be a hole leading to an underground tunnel system under the hotel. The tunnels, according to GRU elements, were built to be used in case of attack or disaster to safely travel underground and was used during the evacuation.

SCP-6360 is currently residing in the Carpathian Mountain range where a large scale containment initiative has been set up. Due to the friendly relationship between the local Hutsuls and SCP-6360, they have be allowed to stay in the containment areas.

**Addendum 2.1:**
During the investigation of a Withering Event, a video camera belonging to one of the victims was discovered. The D-Class who viewed the footage stated he saw SCP-6360 looking at the camera. However, no adverse effects were observed.

Slowing down the footage revealed that SCP-6360 has a set of fully transparent nictitating membranes, which opens up during a visual-based attack. Once opened, the creature’s pupils turn a luminescent golden yellow with a slight reddish ring surrounding it while the creature produces a vocalisation similar to the King Cobra’s growling. Once the target has been killed, this third eyelid closes and the eyes return back to normal.

**Addendum 2.2:** 
Despite the discovery that its normal gaze is not lethal, the creature is still considered a major cognitohazard and precautions are still necessary. Since the gaze is neutralised as recorded footage, a specially designed set of automated goggles providing a video feed with a 0.1 second delay will be developed using the SCRAMBLE goggles.

----
**DATE: 25th March 1999**

**LOCATION: Yugoslavia**

The following is the recovered flight recording of an F-117 Night Hawk Callsign: Vega-6.
----

[BEGIN LOG]

**0330:** Vega-6 piloted by Lt. [REDACTED] is deployed for a clandestine mission over Yugoslavia. Escort considered redundant as area was already subject to SEAD[[footnote]] Suppression of Enemy Air Defences[[/footnote]] operations.

**0350:** Vega-6 enters area. Begins recon. 

**0405:** Target located, coordinates [REDACTED].

**0406:**  Vega-6 engages target: Drops 1 GBU 27 Paveway III. Vega-6 confirms target destroyed.

**0407:** Vega-6 RTB.

**0410:** On route, Vega-6 notices a small blip on the radar. Command confirms there are no aircraft detected in the area at the time. 

**0411:** Vega-6 reports unidentified object moving South east. Object moves parallel to the aircraft.

**0414:** Object begins moving towards Vega-6. Pilot describes the object as big and dark, approaching at high speed. It performs a banking turn and disappears from view. Pilot exclaims, “Holy cow! It’s a dragon!”

**0417:** Object fails to reappear. Vega-6 continues to RTB.

**0419:** Rear of aircraft undergoes hard impact from unknown source. Control surfaces fail. Plane goes into an uncontrollable spin.

**0420:** Pilot attempts to eject, stating: “Mayday! Mayday! It hit me! I’ve lost control to the elevators. I don’t think I can rec-OH GOD!…………”, Screaming is heard before a loud smash is heard, followed by static.

**0422:** Despite multiple attempts to get a response, command loses contact with Vega-6.
[END LOG]
-----


15 hours later, reports came that a Serb militia patrol discovered the wreckage of Vega-6. MTF Unit Volk-7 infiltrated behind Serbian lines to secure the crash site. 

All non-authorised individuals involved were administered amnestics according to their degree of knowledge and involvement.  

The incident was later overshadowed by the downing of another F-117 two days later by Serbian SAMs. The latter was be stated to be the first, and all evidence of the former were destroyed or altered.

Analysis of the wreckage showed damage to the back section of the aircraft with the vertical stabilisers missing and what appeared to be “claw” marks. However, the most damage was done to the cockpit, which was a gaping hole aside from some of the avionics and what was left of the canopy. The extent of the damage suggests that a large object had rammed into the cockpit at a high speed.

Pilot presumed K.I.A.
[[/div]]

With seven similar recorded incidents of downings occurring nearby the Carpathians, it appears that SCP-6360 has begun targeting aircraft. Further precautions will be added to its containment procedures.

[[/collapsible]]

**Addendum 3: Observations in containment**
Despite its size, the creature is incredibly agile, being able to move on land, scale up vertical structures, and fly with ease. The creature is primarily quadrupedal, folding its wings to form clawed forelimbs similar to the Common vampire bat (//Desmodus rotundus//), however is capable of bipedal locomotion as a means of quickly moving across flat ground and closing the distance between it and its prey.

SCP-6360 has excellent vision, which helps it see in low-light conditions, and thermal pits on its beak which enable it to sense heat signatures. The entity also possesses acute olfaction.

SCP-6360 was discovered to have an additional 2 humanoid arms which come out from its body to use for tasks requiring more dexterity. It is unknown how these limbs are concealed in the body. 

Examination of feather samples shows that they are covered with minute scales, creating a hard but lightweight protective surface. These scales, along with the larger ones covering SCP-6360’s body, are anomalously durable, impervious to damage from melee weapons and guns up to 30mm in caliber. SCP-6360’s scales also possess radar absorbent properties, allowing it to have a disproportionately small Radar Cross Section (RCS) compared to its size.

These findings imply that SCP-6360 might have adapted to attack aircraft.

It is suggested that blast damage could stun the creature, and large explosions can possibly injure the creature enough to be safely handled or force it to retreat to heal.

**Addendum 3.1 : Relationship with locals**
The locals in the mountains have been observed leaving food for the creature as offerings. These include livestock, bryndza[[footnote]] a Slovak sheep milk cheese made mainly in Slovakia, but also in Romania, Moldova, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Serbia, Hungary and part of Moravia (Moravian Wallachia) in Czech Republic. Bryndza cheese is creamy white in appearance, known for its characteristic strong smell and taste.[[/footnote]]as well as other oily foods.

Interviews are being conducted to further learn about this relationship. Despite being unforthcoming of their practices, they have dispensed warnings against proceeding too deep into the forest, due to the creature&#39;s highly territorial nature. Surveillance via parabolic microphone of a conversation between a group of locals revealed some information where the word &#34;extermination&#34; was mentioned often, however not enough was recovered to fully understand the context behind this.

**Addendum 3.2: Notice**
Reports of arguments between personnel stationed in research stations in the Carpathians have been increasing. Complaints of taunts and misunderstandings are rife. Psychological screening of the staff is being commenced.

**Addendum 4:**
Upon deliberation from the O5 Council, a mission was planned to clandestinely investigate a suspected SCP-6360 den located in the Romanian Carpathians.

The following is a log of the Research Station 12&#39;s expedition.

**Exploration Video Log Transcript**

**Date:** 16/6/2010

**Exploration Team:** MTF Kappa-2 (Mountain Men)

**Subject:** SCP-6360 - Romanian Carpathians

**Team Lead:** Researcher Florin Nicolescu

**Team Members:** Agent Rednic, Agent Ciobanu, Agent Willard, D-1347, D-1688

[BEGIN LOG]

//Goggle feed shows the men walking in the forest. Researcher Nicolescu is directing the team lead by Agent Rednic to the site from the station&#39;s security room.//

**Rednic:** Goggles are operational.

**Nicolescu:** Everyone else?

**Ciobanu:** Working.

**D-1347:** Working.

**Willard:** Yes. Working fine.

**D-1688:** Good. They&#39;re quite bright.

**Nicolescu:** It&#39;s to help see in the dark, D-1688. Your eyes will adjust.

//They continue walking until they reach what appears to be a cave entrance. The carcass of a Red Deer can be seen outside.//

**Rednic:** There it is.

**Ciobanu:** We&#39;re at the spot. Coast is clear.

**Nicolescu:** Alright, you&#39;ve been briefed on what to look for.

**Ciobanu:** Yes...yes. Feathers, scales, and shit.

**Nicolescu:** I suggest a little more clarity.

**Ciobanu:** Sorry. //[Pauses]// What&#39;s that word for shi-

**D-1347:** Faeces.

**Ciobanu:** //(to D-1347)// He&#39;s talking to me, buddy. Get to work! //(whispering to Nicolescu)//Yeahhhh, that.

**Willard:** Man you got schooled by a D.

**Nicolescu:** (Muffled giggling) Yes, collect the samples and return to base. Be wary of venom residue. Collect samples of that if discovered.

//The D-class begin collecting samples.//

**Rednic:** I think we should be worried about more than just venom.

**Nicolescu:** We&#39;re looking at the cameras. We&#39;ve had the locals keep SCP-6360 occupied far away with food. You&#39;ll have enough time.

**Rednic:** I hope so. I find it strange how they manage to keep it tame towards them.

**D-1688:** Well, I&#39;d be if I was getting free food. And that too delicious ones.

**D-1347:** Hehe. I second that!

**Ciobanu:** Alright guys. Let&#39;s get the stuff.

**D-1347:** We are.

**Rednic:** That&#39;s true, the explanation for providing it caught my attention when I spoke with them.

**Nicolescu:** Hmm? What was it?

**Rednic:** Well, among the offerings and peace keeping stuff, they mentioned, I&#39;m not sure if I mistranslated this, fuel.

**Nicolescu:** Fuel?

**Ciobanu:** That&#39;s a weird way to say food.

**Rednic:** That&#39;s why I&#39;m not sure. You guys speak the language.

**Nicolescu:** I&#39;ll take note of it and check it out. D-1347, have the samples been collected?

**D-1347:** Almost done. Got 4 feathers. Some scales, And blood samples from the carcass. Just packing it.

**Ciobanu:** Well, hurry up! We can&#39;t stay for long.

**D-1688:** Alright! Alright! We&#39;re done.

//The D-class get up.//

**Nicolescu:** Good. Head back to base.

**Rednic:** Yes Sir.

//The men begin making their way back. During the walk, D-1688 trips on a branch//

**D-1688:** Shit.

**Ciobanu:** Watch your step D-1688. These are valuable samples.

**D-1688:** OK! OK!

//Just as they continue walking, Agent Ciobanu stops.//

**Ciobanu:** What did you say to me?

**D-1688:** What?

**Ciobanu:** Did you just call me a bitch!?

**D-1688:** N-No I didn&#39;t.

**Nicolescu:** Ciobanu, no one said anything.

**Ciobanu:** //(Pauses)// OK. Go.

//The men continue walking.//

**Ciobanu:** //(Points his gun at D-1688)// Enough with this D-1688! Stop calling me that!

**Willard:** Ciobanu, calm down, we&#39;ll deal with him at base.

//Agent Rednic and the D-classes turn to look at Ciobanu//

**D-1688:**  Look it didn-Woah! Calm down!

**D-1347:** What the hell are you on? No one said shit!

**Rednic:** Ciobanu stand down.

**Ciobanu:** This guy has been saying insults under his breath for the past two minutes. How can you not hear it?

**D-1347:** I&#39;m right next to him. He said nothing!

**Ciobanu:** Bullshit! //(Turns to Agent Willard.)// You heard it too, right?

**Willard:** Yes. Come on, D-1688. Just apologise.

//The D-class and Agent Ciobanu begin arguing.//

**Nicolescu:** Everyone calm down! I repeat. Calm down. Ciobanu, I promise you no one said anything.

**D-1347:** Exactly. Stop pointing-

**Nicolescu:** D-1347, refrain from making comments or you will face disciplinary action. And Ciobanu please lower your wea-Oh dear.

**Rednic:** What? What&#39;s wrong?

**Nicolescu:** //(Away from the mic)// I need eyes on it now. Check every camera.

**Willard:** What&#39;s going on? //(Turns to the arguing men)// Shut up you guys!

**Rednic:** Sir! What is happening?

//(The men stop arguing and look at Agent Rednic.)//

**Nicolescu:** //(Back to mic)// Get back to base as quickly as you can, SCP-6360 destroyed the camera, we lost foot-

//(Speaking can be heard in the background.)//

**Rednic:** Affirmative. Hurry up guys. We have to go. Haul ass!

//(The men begin running. D-1347&#39;s footage shows movement in the trees.)//

**D-1347:** What is that?

**Nicolescu:** SCP-6360 has been spotted nearby your area. Recovery team is being prepped.

**Rednic:** Noted, we&#39;re getti-

//(Screaming can be heard from behind Rednic. The men turn to see Ciobanu writhing on the ground. Venom is seen being sprayed onto him by SCP-6360 from the foliage.)//

**D-1347:** Oh! What the fuck!

**Ciobanu:** AHHHHHH! AHH! AH FU- A-E-//(incoherent sounds)//

**Willard:** Fire! Fire!

**Rednic:** //(Hands a pistol to D-1688)// Take it! Go!

//The Agents open fire while the D-class run with the samples. The creature rushes forward and slashes Willard with its forelimb. It then hits Rednic with its tail.//

**Rednic:** AHH! My leg. Shit.//(Pulls the pins off some grenades.)// Let&#39;s go you feathery bastard.

//Agent Rednic&#39;s footage shows SCP-6360 looking at him before quickly crawling away.// 

**D-1347:** Come on man! Le-

//D-1347 and D-1688 get knocked over and they tumble down the slope. D-1688&#39;s goggles hit a rock and the footage cuts. D-1347 falls onto flat ground. His footage is now blurry. An explosion is heard.//

**Nicolescu:** K-2-R12. Kappa-2-R12. Is anyone still alive?

//(D-1347&#39;s footage begins moving.)//

**D-1347:**//(Grunts and coughs)// I&#39;m alive. Damn! My back! Myk. Where are you man?

**Nicolescu:** I&#39;m sorry. He&#39;s dead. Get up, you need to get out of there.

**D-1347:** Myk. Oh fuck! He had a wife.

**Nicolescu:** D-1347 you need to-

//(SCP-6360 can be heard shrieking in the distance.)//

**D-1347:** Oh shit...shit!

//D-1347 runs into a nearby crevice.//

**D-1347:** The goggles! The goggles...they&#39;re cracked. What should I do!?

//Trees can be heard rustling in background.//

**Nicolescu:** [In Romanian] Daniel! Close your fucking eyes! Now!

//D-1347 can be seen curled up in the crevice. The sound of rocks crunching can be heard above. SCP-6360 descends down the slope slowly. It crawls onto the ledge 15 metres from D-1347&#39;s location. It looks around and begins hissing.//

**Nicolescu:** Do. Not. Move.

//SCP-6360 stands on its hindlegs, seeming to scan its environment. Its tongue flicks out. It turns its head in the direction of D-1347//

**Nicolescu:** Oh no. No...no...no.

**D-1347:**  [In Romanian] Wh-What&#39;s goin-

**Nicolescu:** [In Romanian] Shut your mouth!

//SCP-6360 stealthily crawls towards that direction. It is now 3 meters from the hidden D-class. D-1347&#39;s suppressed breathing can be heard getting faster.//

//SCP-6360&#39;s neck turns the bend. It is seen staring directly at D-1347. Its low-pitched breathing is heard.//

**D-1347:**//(Muffled crying)// Ma...mama.

//SCP-6360 opens its beak. Just as it goes to fully turn the bend, it is hit multiple times in the side of the head as gunfire rings out from the trees. SCP-6360 turns to the source of the gunfire. It shrieks and charges at the shooter.//

**Nicolescu:** Run! Now!

//D-1347 instantly gets up, pushing his goggles up, and sprints into the forest. As he runs, he turns briefly to see the commotion. An orange figure is seen between the gunflashes before the creature flies into it.//

//After several minutes of running and Researcher Nicolescu giving him directions, D-1347 makes it to the research station.//

**Nicolescu:** Yes! //(Turns to other personnel.)// Open the door!

//The door to the station opens to see 2 guards along with Nicolescu. The man runs into the building as gunfire is heard behind him and the door slams shut. D-1347 collapses to the floor.//

**Nicolescu:** You alright?!

**D-1347:** //(Panting)// I think so. Fucking hell.

//Vocalisations are heard and SCP-6360 is seen flying off from a window.//

[END LOG]

RS-12 reported the situation and defences on the ground were kept on standby.

**Addendum 5:**
SCP-6360 breached its containment perimeter in Romania. A squadron of fighters from the nearest airbase was deployed. Despite the loss of two fighters, the combined air and ground defences were successful in downing the creature.

Personnel at the scene reported that all vegetation surrounding the creature began to wither, and a &#34;sickening odour&#34; was detected. One of the agents went close to SCP-6360 and suddenly collapsed. He was diagnosed later with blood poisoning akin to the symptoms of radiation poisoning. MTF Beta-7  &#34;Maz-Hatters&#34; were immediately called to the scene. It was discovered that SCP-6360&#39;s blood was extremely toxic. The creature was confirmed dead and the body was taken for autopsy.

However, shortly after the killing of the creature, multiple Withering Events occurred consecutively at Foundation research stations across the Carpathians. Footage showed multiple instances of SCP-6360 exiting the mountains and attacking Foundation assets throughout the Carpathians and in Pripyat. Several instances were reported breathing fire and razing Foundation vehicles.

**Addendum 6:**
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
[[=]]
++ **Autopsy Report**
[[/=]]
**Deceased:** SCP-6360-1
----
**Age:** Adult⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀**Length:** 765 cm
**Sex:** Male ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀**Weight:** 260 kg
----
+++ **Examination**
* Blood has been drained from the body for safety.
* Blast damage to the head and torso. Shrapnel was found embedded in the exposed flesh. Several vertebrae fractured.
* Damage to right wing as a result of anti-aircraft shells.
* Eyes open, irises slightly faded, pupils dilated
----
+++ **Diagnosis**
**1)** Head possesses golden bronze serpent eyes. Peeling back the third membrane showed the eyes are surrounded by a red sclerotic ring, and actually possess yellowish irises. Both substantially faded.

**2)** Opening the beak revealed a pair of hinged fangs and four rows of sharp, backwards-curving teeth. Fangs are connected to two large venom glands. Venom has been extracted for further testing. Presence of a Jacobson&#39;s Organ provides the creature greatly improved olfaction.

**3)** Stomach contained several half digested bones and what appeared to be orange and black fabric of some kind. The acid was measured to have a pH of 0.5. Above it is an organ resembling proventriculus[[footnote]]The narrow glandular first region of a bird&#39;s stomach between the crop and the gizzard. [[/footnote]], containing flammable stomach oil in a manner similar to the Fulmar

**4)** Torso possess folds of extra skin. Opening these revealed two reptilian-humanoid arms. Hands posses 5 digits and opposable thumbs.  On the underside of the right forearm was a tattooed word, reading: &#34;Drăgan &#34;.
----
+++ **Summary**
Based on the distinctiveness of the features, it is highly unlikely that these creatures are a result of natural evolution. This level of adaptation is only possible via engineering. 
----
+++ **Cause of death**
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and possible exsanguination.

**Addendum 7:**
The Foundation would later receive information from Researcher Nicolescu and D-1347, who had survived the SCP-6360 attack on RS-12. 

Due to the nature of the encounter, statements from SCP-6360 were reenacted by the two personnel.

**Log Transcript**

The recording takes place around an hour after the downing of the SCP-6360 instance. Research Station-12 was attacked by multiple instances of the creatures.

[BEGIN LOG]

Researcher Nicolescu and D-1347 are holed up in the security room.

**D-1347:** With all due respect I thought you had...like...the cavalry coming.

**Nicolescu:** It will probably take a while. The situation is a little dire out there.

**D-1347:**  Just a &#34;little dire&#34;. Come on Sir! One shredded the place and now there&#39;s God knows how many!

**Nicolescu:** Look I&#39;m trying to get help. Pissing ourselves again is not going to help.

**D-1347:** Sure, but we only have rifles and a pistol against fu-

**Nicolescu:** //(Holds up his index finger)// Shhh!...Shhh. Do you hear that?

**D-1347:** Hear what?

**Nicolescu:** Listen.

//The two men stay silent. Soft singing can be heard through the speakers. The following is a reenactment of the song made by D-1347://

**D-1347:** A survivor?

**Nicolescu:** Who the hell sings in this situation!

//Singing gets louder.//

**D-1347:** //(Gulps audibly)//Tha-That&#39;s Mykola&#39;s song.

**Nicolescu:** Pardon?

**D-1347:** Mykola. D-1688. He used to sing that at night to help him sleep[[footnote]] This song is identified as a  Ukrainian lullaby named &#34;Luli Luli&#34;. [[/footnote]]. Could he-

**Nicolescu:** Sounds like an old man, I can&#39;t see whe-

//Nicolescu turns to see D-1347 standing still.//

**Nicolescu:** What&#39;s wrong?

**D-1347:** S-Sir.

**Nicolescu:**  Daniel. What&#39;s wrong?

//D-1347 points at the door camera footage. An SCP-6360 instance can be seen staring at the camera. It opens it&#39;s mouth slightly. A hissing sound can be heard along with the singing male voice.//

//They look at each other before looking at the door.//

**Nicolescu:** Di- It-It&#39;s locked.

**D-1347**: I don&#39;t think that will stop it.

//The singing stops.//

**SCP-6360:** [In Romanian] Do you see me?

[The conversation is carried out in Romanian.]

//(The men remain silent)//

**SCP-6360:** I could make myself more visible by joining you in there. I would like to talk.

//Nicolescu gestures to D-1347 to train his gun at the door.//

**Nicolescu:** To be clear, we are armed, and backup is on the way.

**SCP-6360:** I think your backup is being eaten at the moment.

**Nicolescu:** //(Pauses)//

**SCP-6360:** May I know the owner of this voice?

**Nicolescu:** //(Gulps)// Uh-u- My name is Florin Nicolescu. I am a researcher.

**SCP-6360:** Ah! A local. Greetings. And your friend?

**Nicolescu:** He&#39;s local too.

**D-1347**: Yes. Why are you doing this?

**SCP-6360:** Why? Self-defence.

**D-1347**: Bullshit! You hunted us! You killed my friend!

**SCP-6360:** Oh!  That wasn&#39;t me. That was my comrade.

**D-1347**: So?! You all still attacked us.

**SCP-6360:** You are forcing us into hiding, and thus hindering our efforts. I should hav-

**Nicolescu:** Wait, pardon me. Hold on. What you mean &#34;hindering our efforts&#34;?

**SCP-6360:** You fools. We are here to stop the spread of the [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-2191 dracul]. And you&#39;re fighting us?

**Nicolescu:** Drac- You mean the vampires.

**SCP-6360:** What else, doctor?! We have been preparing for years and then you send in aircraft to kill us, and keep us here, while that monstrosity thrives.

**Nicolescu:** You were killing peopl-

**SCP-6360:** We kill those who impede in our efforts and encroach upon our strongholds. Collateral is expected in the mission. I agree some could have been avoided. On behalf of my kin, I am sorry, but it is all for the greater good.

**Nicolescu:** Your kin downed a stealth aircraft. And several others.

**SCP-6360:** It was-//(Cocks head)//Wait...Stealth?

//(The instance produces a vocalisation of a vulture squawking in a manner similar to cackling)//

**SCP-6360:** It was trying to stay hidden?! Drăgan told us it lit up like a firefly.

**D-1347**: Who&#39;s Drăgan ?

**SCP-6360:** Huh? Oh that&#39;s the one who took it down. And the one who hunted you and...is now sadly dead. That bastard bombed one of our nests, and killed his wife, Elena. We all have names, I am Ştefan. So he was understandably mad. He then convinced all of us to be wary of aircraft near our mountains.

**Nicolescu:** I believe that was accidental. The target was a Serb camp, n-not the nest.

**SCP-6360:** Hmmm...the others will have to be convinced.

**Nicolescu:** I&#39;m sorry on behalf of our organisation.

**SCP-6360:** Apology accepted. But the fact remains that you are doing a big mistake by impeding our task. We have been forced to move through tunnels and fight underground.
Our numbers are only increasing, and so will the attacks. So I require you to make a deal. You might want a paper.

//Researcher Nicolescu gestures to D-1347 to give him a paper. He takes out a pen and starts writing.//

**Nicolescu:** Ready.

**SCP-6360:** We will stop the attacks if your organisation stops attacking and pushing us into captivity. We both have a common enemy, so it would be wise to work with each other to vanquish it.

**Nicolescu:** Done. I will relay the message.

**SCP-6360:** Good. I hope you are wise. Farewell.

//The creature crawls out of the station and flies away.//

**Addendum 8:**
The following journal was provided to Foundation personnel together with a shepherd&#39;s axe by several village elders. The journal detailed diagrams of SCP-6360 as well as an album containing pictures, names, and other personal information of the people listed, corroborating Researcher Nicolescu and D-1347s&#39; statements. 

An note was found at the end of the journal. The excerpt is translated from Rusyn for convenience.

Our fate was in question. As much we loved the Grand Karcist and his beliefs, we could not stand by as our fellow people are slaughtered to feed this...monstrosity. I do not care what is thought of us. No loving God will allow and even demand the blood of our loved ones. We made the fateful decision upon learning that the Mother is spreading. We will not allow others to befall the same fate as our country. So we left to the mountains to create something to stop this...in the only way we could.

We engineered our creation in its image. We travelled far and wide to collect samples for traits which would help in combating the beast. Lammergeier for aerial prowess and digestive abilities. Hamadryad for its piercing stare and, as well as multiple venomous creatures, for toxicity. We then spliced it with our own bodies.

**Addendum 9:** 
A truce has been made with SCP-6360. The Foundation will allow them to inhabit the Carpathians to serve as a defence against SCP-2191 activity. Plans are being made for further operations.

The use of SCP-6360&#39;s venom is being considered as a chemical agent to neutralise Sarkic anomalies.
