[[/tab]]
[[tab Evidence]]

The following evidence was found in a hotel room used by Alan Moore, shortly before the entity was discovered. Reported by hotel staff to the police, and subsequently investigated by the UIU.

**Occult Iconography:** Various symbols written on the walls. Furniture had been moved aside to allow room for an immense symbol on the floor of the room. All symbols on the wall were written in black Sharpie, and the symbol on the floor was created from marinara sauce purchased from a nearby convenience store.

**Journal Entry:** A page of paper from a book, with a journal entry written on it.

&gt; Dear Diary,
&gt; 
&gt; Another day has come and gone, where I have been accosted and harassed by fans all my waking hours. It&#39;s awful. All of them see me as a writer, nothing more. They want autographs, and give me their praise, then they leave and brag about how they met the &#34;great Alan Moore&#34;.
&gt; 
&gt; I doubt I should be complaining, but I&#39;m tired of it. Everyone wants to see me and touch me, show how much they love me. I can hardly remember the last time I had a meaningful interaction with someone.
&gt; 
&gt; That doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t like that people love me, I guess. I just want someone to actually care enough to want to know me. I want someone who can see who I really am.

[[/tab]]

[[tab Bureau Record]]

**Current Status:** Unconfined. UIU agents are tracking the entity, as well as ensuring that it does not achieve its primary goal of meeting Alan Moore.

**History of UIU Action:**

__2/11/2001:__ Entity was found outside of Indianapolis, heading east. UIU agents attempted to detain the entity, to no avail. Entity flew upward into clouds and visual contact is lost.

__2/16/2001:__ Entity is spotted a few miles outside of Moore&#39;s hometown. UIU agents were sent to investigate. Agent Richards encountered the entity and briefly spoke with it.

&gt; **Richards:** Excuse me! I&#39;m with the U.S. government, may I have a word with you please?
&gt; 
&gt; **Entity:** Hello! I&#39;m on my way to see someone, but I have some time to chat! Is something wrong?
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** A bit, yeah. For starters, do you have a name?
&gt; 
&gt; **Entity:** Oh! No.
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** Okay... Where are you from? Why are you here?
&gt; 
&gt; **Entity:** Alan made me! He seemed freaked out and ran away, but I&#39;m sure it was just a misunderstanding. He really needs me, after all.
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** Why does he need you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Entity:** Well, I&#39;m his biggest fan! I have to meet him!
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** So what are you planning to do when you meet him?
&gt; 
&gt; **Entity:** Uuh...
&gt; 
&gt; //[A few moments of silence.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Entity:** I&#39;m... going to be his friend, obviously! And his biggest fan! It&#39;ll go great.
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s the best idea. Why don&#39;t you come with us, we can talk about it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Entity:** No thank you! I have to hurry!

The entity proceeded to evade capture once again. It continued evasive maneuvers until it located Moore on the outskirts of the town, who was being assisted by UIU agents.

&gt; **Entity:** There you are!
&gt; 
&gt; **Moore:** You again? Get away from me!
&gt; 
&gt; **Entity:** Wait, what? What&#39;s wrong?
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** Stand down!
&gt; 
&gt; **Entity:** I&#39;m so confused! Why can&#39;t I see Alan?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Kel[[footnote]]Member of evacuation squad for Moore.[[/footnote]]:** Mr. Moore, please come with us. They&#39;ll deal with the irregularity.
&gt; 
&gt; **Moore:** //[Steps into van.]// Please, please do.
&gt; 
&gt; **Entity:** Wait, why are you leaving?
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** Stop where you are, right now!
&gt; 
&gt; **Entity:** But I need to see Alan!

The entity proceeded to evade capture once again by following upwards from a high altitude. Air support was dispatched, but failed to locate it due to overcast weather hindering visual contact. Moore was relocated to a UIU outpost temporarily until a more permanent solution could be found.

__2/23/2001:__ Entity was spotted just outside of the UIU outpost where Moore is temporarily located. Agent Richards was sent again to distract the entity while personnel prepared for evacuation of Moore to a separate site.

&gt; **Richards:** Hello?
&gt; 
&gt; **Entity:** Hello again! Have you seen Alan? He should be right here...
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** Unfortunately, we can&#39;t let you see him right now. Not until you answer a few questions for us.
&gt; 
&gt; **Entity:** Wait, why not?
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** You&#39;re being a major disruption. We can&#39;t have you wandering around like this, it&#39;s causing mass disturbance and we&#39;re the ones who have to deal with it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Entity:** Oh dear, I&#39;m very sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to cause trouble for anyone, it&#39;s just that I really need to see Alan!
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** That&#39;s something I wanted to ask you about. Why do you need to see Mr. Moore so badly? Why is this so important to you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Entity:** You just don&#39;t understand him the way I do. I see who he really is!

The entity proceeded to fly into a transport vehicle carrying Moore out of the outpost. The force of the collision caused the vehicle to crash. No personnel were injured, and Moore was the first to exit the vehicle.

&gt; **Moore:** You! I thought I told you to go away!
&gt; 
&gt; **Entity:** But I had to see you!
&gt; 
&gt; **Moore:** No! Stop! Just leave me alone! I don&#39;t want you here!
&gt; 
&gt; **Entity:** Why not?
&gt; 
&gt; **Moore:** Because you&#39;ve been a total pain ever since you were created! Stalking me, harassing me. The reason I summoned you was to be something that would do the opposite of that!
&gt; 
&gt; **Entity:** I just wanted to be your friend...
&gt; 
&gt; **Moore:** Friends aren&#39;t constantly with you all the time! Talking about how much they love you or look up to you!
&gt; 
&gt; **Entity:** But that&#39;s exactly what friends do!
&gt; 
&gt; **Moore:** No, that&#39;s what fans do. I wanted you to be both, but it seems like you got the worst half of it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Entity:** Do you just not want me to be your friend?
&gt; 
&gt; **Moore:** That&#39;s exactly what I wanted, but-
&gt; 
&gt; **Entity:** Then why won&#39;t you let me be your friend? You won&#39;t even give me a chance.
&gt; 
&gt; **Moore:** Because you&#39;re a constant annoyance!
&gt; 
&gt; **Entity:** Well, fine! Then I don&#39;t want to be your friend!

Entity flies upwards and into the clouds. Rain begins falling shortly thereafter.

__3/03/2001:__ Entity has remained unspotted since the previous incident. However, Moore received a letter, most likely from the entity, which he submitted to the FBI.

&gt; Dear Alan,
&gt; 
&gt; I do hope you&#39;re well. I&#39;m sorry for getting mad when we talked. I have been annoying, and I should stop trying to make you be my friend. I&#39;ll leave you alone, but I still want to be your friend. It&#39;s just that now I know that being a friend might mean sometimes that they might not like you at first, and that&#39;s okay. I just hope that one day, you&#39;ll want to meet me, because I promise that I&#39;m more sincere than you think.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you.
