**Item #:** SCP-057-PT

**Threat Level:** Orange [[span style=&#34;color:orange&#34;]]●[[/span]]

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Currently, methods to fully contain SCP-057-PT cannot be applied due to the nature of the anomaly, SCP-057-PT instances, and its geographical proportions. All civilians attempting to enter the internal area of SCP-057-PT must be extracted from the nearby vicinity. If any type of counter-assertion is demonstrated, the individual must be treated with Class-B amnestics. SCP-057-PT&#39;s provisional containment measures involve the installation of wall-cladding material thoroughly circulating the edifice, blocking any unauthorized individuals whilst protecting the integrity of the structure. The installation is currently located in a forest environment of the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina. Although the edifice periodically moves in between locations, it has already been spotted by agents in three different states.

The entrance preceding the installations must be guarded by two agents equipped with medium-to-heavy military firearms. The same equipment must be provided to the agents securing the external perimeter, which must be guarded by seven agents. A state of high-alert must be maintained even throughout the night when the peculiarities pertaining to the installation become temporarily non-existent.

The reception area of the installation must be guarded by seven security agents armed with pistols — who are required to attend to the instances documented in __**Document-057AB**__. Every and any change that may happen in the secured areas must be communicated immediately upon notice; such as attacks or affronting changes in the behaviour of the instances.

&gt; Following the containment breach in which a Class-D subject abandoned its position as an observer from the gates of the institution, and entered it, allegedly &#34;feeling really cold&#34;, it has been noted that SCP-057-PT-1 and SCP-057-PT-2, although present in the vespertine period, had disappeared. This pattern of disappearances and reappearances during the night-period has been confirmed as one of the characteristics of the anomaly.

&gt; The primary instances, SCP-057-PT-1 and SCP-057-PT-2, have demonstrated unstable personalities, vehemently questioning the guards about the reason why they are in the institution, and periodically becoming irritated with the presence thereof. Any acts with affronting objectives must be dealt with by neutralising or terminating the relevant instances. Low-calibre projectiles have managed to quickly dispatch these instances due to their particular physical weakness.

**Description:** SCP-057-PT is characterised as a medical institution built in the year of 194█, with a structure fit to about three hundred and forty singular hospital beds. The structure hosts four pharmacies, thirty-five medical offices, five kitchens, one storage facility, twenty-five office rooms, and eight laboratories; the veracity of whether these facilities have been used to the performance of the activities they are destined for is inconclusive, although it is theorized that these rooms have been used for the conduction of experiments relating to [DATA EXPUNGED]. Of note, at the external gardens, there is a three-meter wall with a six-meter plat in which groups of six //Prunus dulcis// (almond trees) are displaced in segments of three, blossoming independent of the current season.

------

A significant amount of the installation&#39;s internal walls are covered by a rugous material analogous to a type of concrete; an equally relevant amount of surfaces are drawn with symbols of unknown exordium, though similar to catalogued arcane engravings, due to its innumerable idiosyncrasies. In the vicinities in which experiments were conducted, it is possible to observe a series of codes and names, cross-referencing one another and the engravings. These epithets are written in English, thus alluding to the possibility that SCP-057-PT may have been present in English-speaking countries.

The location does not display anomalies when visualised externally. Nevertheless, commencing the vespertine period, it is possible to notice the apparition of two sapient instances: SCP-057-PT-1 -- a female entity taking on the role of a nurse; SCP-057-PT-2 -- a male entity taking on the role of a scientist or, periodically, a proper medical doctor.

After this event, every individual with any type of ailment[[footnote]]Exceptionally concussions, dilaceration or bruises.[[/footnote]] -- physical or psychological -- within a seven meter radius in the instances&#39;s line of sight will be transported to an illuminated room. In that room, the individual will be connected to a machine of unprecedented origin that will unravel the personality and memories of the subject, analysing and judging its previous actions.

If the subject has displayed an adequate and amicable relationship with the individuals that have been present in its life, it will be healed from all its ailments, including terminal diseases; these subjects do not feel discomfort or fear when whilst undergoing the probing events, considering the primary instances and the environment as &#34;pleasant&#34;. Though, if the subject has displayed an inadequate and inimical relationship towards the individuals relevant to his life, it will experience great discomfort and aversion to both instances and the environment, undergoing a complete thaumaturgic-transmutative process that will transform the subject into one of the following secondary instances:

**SCP-057-PT-3:** Is characterised as a powerful light with a silver triangle in its centre, releasing rays of illuminating light with an intensity of one-hundred-thousand lumens. Anyone standing within a ten meter radius of the object is affected with extreme ocular discomfort (even whilst not maintaining visual contact), followed by temporary or permanent blindness.

Any exemplary of this instance must be dispatched by the STF-PT57-α, utilising the rapid-response high-opacity visual equipment at their disposal.

**SCP-057-PT-4:** Is characterised as a replica of the microorganism //Streptococcos pneumoniae// with thirty centimetres of height by twenty centimetres of width, and exactly one kilogram of weight. If a subject fixates its gaze or stands in the same unobstructed environment as SCP-057-PT-4, the subject will suddenly be whelmed by asphyxia and incessant, compulsory coughing, dying due to lung obstruction three minutes after the manifestation of the symptoms.

The organism is extremely fragile against excessive heat; for that reason, the STF-P1-α has been geared with controlled incendiary rapid-response equipment for deployment in case that terminating the instances with projectiles is not plausible.

  A recovered missive from SCP-057-PT-2.
&gt;  Mary,
&gt;  I have never felt the most profound and forlorn corners of my mind so altercated in such a manner as they are right now. Thousands of soldiers were harmed, and now it is up to us to make the choice of who we will tender. I am shattered and can bear no more the degradation of their bodies, losing their lives just because of the lack of medication and proper facilities. Forgive me for my decisions, Mary, forgive-me.

&gt; **Test 01-A**

&gt; * A subject with a grave intracranial tumor was sent to the institution with the objective of enquiring concrete data about SCP-057-PT. After entering the location, the subject was accompanied by two agents to the vicinity where the primary instances had been manifested. After entering the radius of effect, the subject was materialised inside the room equipped with the anomalous machinery.

&gt; * **Results:** The individual was completely healed from their brain tumor. A battery of radiographic tests confirmed the circumstances. Subject ministered with 3 dosages of Class-B amnestics, and put into observation for three continuous days.

&gt; * A subject with renal insufficiency was sent to the institution; given the previous test, it was expected that the subject would be healed from its affectation. After being conducted to the radius of effect, the instances dematerialised with it. Nearby guards allegedly heard acutely uncomfortable vocalizations echoing throughout the facility.

&gt; * **Results:** The experiment succeeded with the creation of an SCP-057-PT-3 instance. The instance was terminated using the standard procedures after the elaboration thereof through the analysis of the instance&#39;s qualities.

Recovered documents:

**Fragment of Dr. ██████ █████&#39;s declaration:**

I don&#39;t know if this should be happening, dear workers, gears that turn this hospital.
But the circumstances are proving quite unfavourable to us. The current political conflicts of our dear country against foreign forces are leaving us stranded in a storm without the necessary supplies to survive it. Before all of this, our institution was one of the greatest; this is a clear demonstration that anything can go from regal to rubbish.

At the very end of our success, although we possess the best equipment, we do not have enough space, and the current circumstances do not facilitate investments. We must expand our horizons if we wish to maintain ourselves as a working medical institution. That contextualised, today we will turn the tides; we shan&#39;t depend solely on the medical metier, we will invest, too, in the scientific metier. There are several foreigners interested in [DATA EXPUNGED], therefore we will give it to them. We will create the future, we will create the &#34;New Human&#34;, we will create &#34;The New Humanity&#34;.

**A recovered page from Dr. ██████ █████&#39;s diary:**

Today we had an interview with one of the investors interested in the proposal of a &#34;New Humanity&#34;. It seemed to me that the man was quite affluent despite commenting on his humble origins, hailing from a rural environment, ascending to his status through sweat and labour; such is the continuous realisation of the characteristic effort employed by farmers. He told me about wonders, emphasizing everything he said with exaggerated gestures and detailed instructions of what I should do. These are the people that will live in the perfect society, those that work for the good of the collective, and of God. **Our** God.

**Poem found by Dr. Aliest Jones:**

Argent gleam.
With its mushroom shape.
Falling through the sky.
Leaving everything in shambles.
Argent gleam.
That yearns to arrive.
And for all of us.
Another society to fall.
That through destruction.
Comes construction.
Through mutation.
Comes perfection.

**Document recovered from one of the abandoned offices:**

I don&#39;t know if someone will read these thoughts, though it is probable that it&#39;ll be completely destroyed, I still write it with a sliver of hope.

What is happening in here managed to leave my sanity in shambles. I don&#39;t know if all of this happens under veils and that the other functionaries are aware of what is happening or if only a select group of individuals knows what type of activities are performed in here.

What I&#39;m trying to say: I met with a figure I had never seen before, but by the degree of authority ostented by the man, I believe him to be one of the owners of the hospital. He calmly invited me to his office, asked me to feel comfortable and help myself to some of his coffee.

He spoke of deliriums, of non-existent things, and those that were, put simply, unimaginable. He spoke of the human evolution through the most... sanguinary methods, and kept emphasizing and boasting about a place called the &#34;Scientific Wing&#34;, where everything was planned and performed.

I exhibited no expression. Only thanked him for the hints and left the room, feeling my stomach turn upside-down. I vividly memorized his words; I have a bad feeling every time I remember them. Those words spoke of anomalies that contend with the laws of nature. Thaumaturgy and telekinesis were a few of the bizarre inanities he spoke of.

He said that the perfect world would be comprised by anomalies such as weasels that shred and disintegrate humans, spears that can perforate the skies, portals to different dimensions...

And everything would be achieved through the cruelest experiments.

In principle, I thought that those were only daydreams and illusions from a tired soul. But I accidentally stumbled upon the aforementioned &#34;Scientific Wing&#34;. You know naught what I witnessed. Tests and mechanical paraphernalia scattered about; some of those technologies simulated organs, others dilacerated animals. Medics and scientists with impure gazes watched that macabre spectacle, throughout filled with death and tragedy. It is incredible what humans can do to reach their objectives.

And I&#39;ll only say this: goodbye. Your mission is to help me, help us. I beg of you. I will not be able to write anymore, as my typewriter is running out of ink-ribbon, and I can hear the soldiers marching towards the hospital. Please, just help me.
