As some of you may know, I got to run the 11th Annual Art Exchange alongside [[*user J Dune]], [[*user PlaguePJP]], and [[*user psychicprogrammer]]. I won&#39;t lie, it was a little stressful, but seeing everyone be so happy with their gifts made up for it. I&#39;m glad I was able to continue this lovely little site tradition. However, we couldn&#39;t have done it this year without the pinch hitters! 

In case you didn&#39;t know, pinch hitters are people who sign up to create more than one gift in the event someone&#39;s gifter drops out or can&#39;t make their own gift for whatever reason. This year there were more dropouts than usual, so we had to get a bunch of pinch hitters on the job. As a special thank you, I would like to take this opportunity to invite them to plug an article they enjoy!

Let&#39;s see em, pinch hitters!

 [[*user Synthpanda_]] plugs [[[In A New Light]]], and says:
&gt; A short, personal tale about being lost, with help from Waltz.

[[*user FLOORBOARDS]] plugs [[[stay-in-here-away-in-wet-dry-world|Where Would You Like To Go?]]] , and says:
&gt; I doodle myself on the water tower, a silver-grey feline against the prison-white pallet. The sun sets over my margins.

[[*user Nykacolaquantum]] plugs  [[[yggdrasils-surveyor|Yggdrasil&#39;s Surveyor]]] and says:
&gt; A pet project of mine that emphasizes fleshing out the Foundation multiverse, the wonders and perils that come with traveling through it, and a different take on an underrated series 1 skip, open for anyone to contribute!

[[*user UraniumEmpire]] plugs [[[Tears and Bone]]] and says:
&gt; Was it all planned, or was the Scarlet Fool&#39;s misery a matter of serendipity? Could he have done anything to mitigate his fate? Were the Scarlet Fool&#39;s words so ugly as to warrant such revenge? Or was his torment simply an expression of the unspoken hierarchy?


[[*user Harmacy]] plugs [[[mtf-theta-90-hub-page|MTF Theta 90 Hub Page]]] and says:
&gt; Right Angles, Life in Mobile Task Force Theta-90&#34; has been an ongoing series since 2014, featuring a foundation task force as they tackle anomalous geometry in the field. The characters are compelling, and their interactions are realistic and relatable. If you&#39;re looking for action-packed stories about mathematics with a fair bit of slice-of-life shenanigans, this is the series for you!

[[*user Doctor Cimmerian]] plugs [[[SCP-2343]]] and says:
&gt; You know, there was a moment years ago when I thought this would actually become higher rated than SCP-343.

[[*user Mr Carbon]] plugs [[[Four Years Later]]] and says:
&gt; When I became active again after a four-year absence, I decided my modestly successful MTF Theta-90 series should resume with a similar time skip -- hence, &#34;Four Years Later.&#34; Except there wasn&#39;t any fanfare and I posted it without really plugging it. So hardly anyone read it. Which is a shame, as it&#39;s my favorite entry in the series thus far. I hope you like it.

[[*user J Dune]] plugs [[[SCP-6345]]] and says:
&gt; A fun little article about luchadores and skeletons that never seemed to capture a whole lot of attention. I’m still very happy with it, and I’d appreciate it if you gave it a read!

[[*user HarryBlank]] plugs [[[SCP-7840]]] and says:
&gt; The heartwarming story of a marionette who wants to become a real boy, blood and guts and gristle and all.

[[*user Uncle Nicolini]] plugs [[[Taking Care of the Kids]]] and says:
&gt; I received this gift for the 2019 Art Exchange and it&#39;s been a personal favorite of mine ever since then. It&#39;s about Jude and Faeowynn going on a hike and talking about being adults and trans. It&#39;s truly wonderful, [[*user kinchtheknifeblade]] is probably my favorite author and receiving this as a gift from her floored me. I hope you give it a read.


[[*user Battleblockb0ss]] plugs [[[gamers-against-war|Gamers Against War]]] and says:
&gt; This is the first tale I&#39;ve produced that I feel totally satisfied with! I like the dialogue and others seemed to as well. It&#39;s also the first Gamers Against Weed article for a while.

[[*user LOVEMARGINAL]] plugs [[[Testing the Margins]]] and says:
&gt; As somebody who forms  strong emotional attachments to fictional characters, I love seeing foundation staff getting to be human and relatable. As a lesbian,  I love watching hot foundation women be gal pals. [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/testing-the-margins## The tale] I got for AE was perfect for me in so many ways, so if you don&#39;t mind longform too much, I strongly encourage you to experience it for yourself. 

[[*user Rounderhouse]] plugs [[[Mountainous Essophysics]]] and says:
&gt; An incredibly tightly-written tale that manages to make statistical finance, that most banal of subjects, strange and beautiful and fascinating -- all under the shadow of Mount Inequality.

++ INTCON has been announced!
[[/=]]

Great news for fans of collaboration this new year!

The [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/ SCP-INT Wiki] has announced a brand new contest to start off 2023; [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/international-collaboration-contest-2023 The International Collaboration Contest!]

[[image https://scp-int.wdfiles.com/local--files/international-collaboration-contest-2023/INT%20Contest%20Banner.png]]
= [[size 75%]]Banner by Al_W0onder&#39;s[[/size]]

The contest&#39;s theme is simple; write about collaboration between two branches of the Foundation alongside a friend from another language branch. Both parties must represent different language branches of the Foundation in order for this to be considered for the contest and as an INT SCP. If you&#39;re interested in participating, head on down to the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/chat-guidelines INT Discord chat] and seek out a partner within! There are sure to be many people interested in collaborating from across many branches, so you will probably find a partner quickly.

Submission of entries to the contest will open on the 30th of January 2023 at 0 UTC, and close a week later at 0 UTC on the 6th of February 2023. Voting will end two weeks later on February 20th, at which point the winners will be announced. The winners will be the three articles with the highest number of votes, and these articles will be featured on the main page of the International Translation Archive.

Works are featured on the site’s front page as part of the Reviewers’ Spotlight, which acknowledges the time and effort spent by forum reviewers helping other authors develop and edit and their works for the mainsite. Each month, community members are encouraged to nominate forum reviewers who have been both particularly helpful and active. Members of the Forum Criticism Team will then discuss the nominations, and select four prominent reviewers to choose the month’s Reviewers’ Spotlight front-page features.
