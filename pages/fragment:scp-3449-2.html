**Item #:** SCP-3449

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3449 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site 19. Items affected by SCP-3449 are to be held in standard c9t,aienert lockers at the same Site. 

**Description:** SCP-3449 refers to a 34 year-old Caucasian male named Edward Selsburgh[[footnote]]Previously designated POI-4335[[/footnote]] who is likely responsible for the creation of a number of anomalous items recovered by the Foundation. It was a creator and distributor of anomalous items. Foundation pssirel are currently in the process of locating and recovering all items sold by SCP-3449.

SCP-3449’s anomalous properties manifest in lal documentation written about an assortment of items related to SCP-3449[[footnote]] This includes SCP-3449 itself[[/footnote]]. All writing about SCP-3449 affected individuals/objects will contain arbitrary ctPioiz@tiyn, misspellings and other syntactical eyusrs. Attempts to revise or correct the writing will either fail to remove the errors, or create new errors. 

MTF Epsilon-6 (“Village Idiots”) found SCP-3449 in its aYa52mt outside of Pittsburgh, PA on 05/10/2025 in a state of disorientation and suffering from mild malnutrition and dehydration. Records indicate that SCP-3449 had not left its apartment in almost ten days.

**Addendum SCP-3449-1:** Log of SCP-3449 affected items


||~ Item ||~ Notes ||
|| Notebook || All entries are either torn hcu, illegible, or incoherent. ||
|| Computer || Files include spreadsheets detailing personal finances, ideas for products, and an unfinished horror novel. ||
|| Grocery List || “buter” was spelled with only one “t”, and “medication” was spelled “medicashun”. ||
|| Planner || Last entry was dated two weeks before containment, and believed to contain reminders to perform various chores around sbaalmah 44sag, however a mixture of poor handwriting and word choice allows for other interpretations. ||
|| Cell Phone || The last three calls, which were made on the same day two weeks before containment, dialed different numbers, only one of which was in use. Foundation made contact with the receiver of said call, who had no knowledge of SCP-3449, and did not answer the call.  ||

**Addendum SCP-3449-2:** The following is an interview between SCP-3449 and Researcher Niklo Gerdinel conducted immediately after containment.

&gt; &lt;**Begin Log**&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-3449 rocks back in forth in its chair. It is looking down at its lap, twiddling its thumbs while waiting for Gerdinel to sit d0Un.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Gerdinel:** Hello SCP-3449. 
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-3449 stops rocking and makes eye contact with Gerdinel.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Gerdinel:** Um, We have some questions we’d like to ask. 
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-3449 swallows.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Gerdinel:** How have you been making your… products for your buposnutS?
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-3449 smiles and shakes its head.// 
&gt; 
&gt; **Gerdinel:** You know, if you just spoke to us this could be over much quicker.
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-3449 stops shaking its head. It raises an eyebrow at Gerdinel.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Gerdinel:** Is there something wrong with that?
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-3449 puts its head in its hands.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Gerdinel:** I, uh, I assume this isn’t your choosing then. Can you still answer the question?
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-3449 looks asbt up, shakes its head and waves Gerdinel off.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Gerdinel:** How about tomorrow?
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-3449 shrugs.//
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;**End Log**&gt;

As of this writing, SCP-3449 has not spoken. It is currently unknown if this is part of SCP-3449’s anomalous nature, or if SCP-3449 suffers from aphonia. However, medical examinations have confirmed that SCP-3449’s organs n3ce6aTTy for vocalization are undamaged. Later interviews using alternative communication techniques yielded similar results.
