**Item #:** SCP-4922

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Four instances of SCP-4922 have been contained at Site-59&#39;s maximum security wing. Each cell has been fitted with a Naismith-Henderson Lambda Wave Sink[[footnote]] A device reverse-engineered from the mucus of [[[SCP-2803]]]-A to attract and suppress lambda wave transmissions [[/footnote]]; these are to remain operational at all times, with at least three backup power sources. In the event of total containment failure, contingency 99-Sutekh is to be enacted at the discretion of Director Naismith.

All other instances encountered outside of containment are to be summarily destroyed with sustained heavy machine gun fire.

**Description:** SCP-4922 designates a series of hostile synthetic military constructs that are believed to be extradimensional in origin. Instances vary in appearance, but maintain the following common traits:

* A monochromatic white color scheme,
* Primary composition is of an as-of-yet unidentified ballistics-grade material that bears the characteristics of steel, plastic, and felt,
* Speech capabilities, and
* An insignia of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2578 three crescent moons].

In addition, the majority of SCP-4922 instances encountered have possessed non-functional eyes, limbs, and other design features. The most common design of SCP-4922 is that of a humanoid soldier 1.5 meters in height with exaggerated facial features. 

++ SCP-4922 Instances Currently In Containment:

||~ Number ||~ Description ||~ Status ||
|| SCP-4922-5 || Beaked humanoid entity, 3m in height, wears body armor. Answers to the name &#34;Bigger Bird.&#34; || Contained. ||
|| SCP-4922-17 || Humanoid entity, 1.5m in height, wears body armor. Answers to the name &#34;Phil.&#34; || Contained. ||
|| SCP-4922-20 || Quadrupedal equine entity, 2m in height. Answers to the name &#34;Boss Hoss.&#34; || Contained. ||
|| SCP-4922-47 || Humanoid entity identical to SCP-4922-17. Answers to the name &#34;Philippe.&#34; Speaks English in an exaggerated, stereotypical French accent. || Contained. ||
|| SCP-4922-4 || Small, vaguely humanoid entity 1m in height, unarmored. Answers to the name &#34;Wilkins.&#34; A resemblance to a commercial character of the same name[[footnote]] Wilkins was a puppet created by Jim Henson for Wilkins Coffee commercials between 1957 and 1961, infamous for their use of abrupt comic violence. [[/footnote]] has been noted. || [4/4922 CLEARANCE REQUIRED] ||

The whimsical designs, combined with the fact that the drones&#39; manners of speech have individual personalities and dialects, give the impression that SCP-4922 is some manner of weaponized puppet. This is believed to be an aesthetic design choice, as it serves no functional purpose in combat.

Instances of SCP-4922 display extraordinary combat abilities, hidden bladed weapons, high-energy plasma weapons systems, and proficiency with firearms and unarmed combat, as well as a regenerative factor from damage taken in battle. 

Sustained heavy machine gun fire is the only known method of terminating SCP-4922. In addition, instances&#39; can be rendered temporarily immobile through the inhibition of nearby lambda waves[[footnote]] Specialized telepathic energy, first discovered during experiments with SCP-████ [[/footnote]].

SCP-4922 is most often encountered in populated areas, carrying out extrajudicial termination of, as labeled by SCP-4922-17, &#34;Class M Damnation Candidates.&#34; Confirmed deaths caused by SCP-4922 have included, but are not limited to:

* Chaos Insurgency operatives,
* serial rapists,
* leaders in the neo-nazi community and similar organizations,
* members of the now-defunct GoI-24174 &#34;Daughters of Bogal Mountain&#34;,
* members of the now-defunct [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2427 Brazen Heart], and
* at least 15 male okapi //(Okapia johnstoni)//[[footnote]] Context unknown; SCP-4922-17 claimed &#34;they know damn well what they did.&#34; [[/footnote]].

It is believed that SCP-4922 operates as a force of assassins under the same extradimensional authority as SCP-2578, [[[SCP-3922]]], and other objects with the same three-crescent insignia.

&gt; **Date:** 5/19/2018
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Craig Paulsen
&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-4922-4
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;Begin Log&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Paulsen:** Good morning, SCP-4922-4, I hope you&#39;re feeling--
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4922-4:** Lemme outta these restraints! My coffee&#39;s innocent, test the DNA!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Paulsen:** Um, right. You seem to have an insignia of three crescent moons on your chest.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4922-4:** That&#39;s right, but you know what I don&#39;t have? A nice, hot, refreshing cup of Wilk--
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Paulsen:** What is your connection to the Three Moons Initiative?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4922-4:** ...huh. Well, looks like you&#39;ve been doin&#39; your homework. I guess the coffee schtick ain&#39;t gonna hold up for much longer, is it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Paulsen:** Please answer the question.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4922-4:** Right, right. Okay, so: I&#39;m one of their drones, I work for the psychotronics division, they send us over from [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2922 the other side] because only inorganic matter can break outta Corbenic, and the Master controls my every move.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Paulsen:** If you&#39;re a drone, what purpose does your personality serve?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4922-4:** Now, that&#39;s just rude. The Master controls all [REDACTED] of us at once from a chemical sarcophagus, and he doesn&#39;t get another vacation for at least a century. He takes whatever playtime he can get.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Paulsen:** Who is this &#34;Master?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4922-4:** Would you like to talk to him? &#39;Cause I don&#39;t know how much I&#39;m allowed say in my own voice.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Paulsen:** May I?
&gt; 
&gt; [ SCP-4922-4 falls limp in its restraints, remaining unresponsive for five seconds. A male voice (heretofore PoI-4922-Prime) emanates from its body. ]
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-4922-Prime:** Might this be Dr. Craig Paulsen?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Paulsen:** ...um, right. To whom am I speaking?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-4922-Prime:** Colonel James Henson, Three Moons Initiative Humanity Defense Corps, Psychotronics Division, you-are-watched-you-are-protected-you-are-loved-yadda-yadda-yadda -- at your service.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Paulsen:** Wait, Henson? As in, Jim--
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-4922-Prime:** Only the pinko from 2N goes by Jim. I&#39;m James, from Earth, Multiversal Iteration 2L. So, lemme guess - next question, &#39;why are you a killer?&#39;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Paulsen:** There wouldn&#39;t have been name-calling involved, but I would like to understand your motivation.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-4922-Prime:** Nah, you can say it, I&#39;m a killer. Never wanted to be one, but that&#39;s my job, and I&#39;m proud. Like my 2N counterpart, I knew that puppets could entertain people of all ages. That they could teach.
&gt; 
&gt; Then... well, back in &#39;89, the whole earth was gonna go up in flames from some alien invasion, so [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3319 the Lotus] took our planet into Corbenic. Second Harvesting War...
&gt; 
&gt; [Approx. 10 seconds of silence.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Paulsen:** Sir?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-4922-Prime:** What, you think you&#39;re gonna hear a detailed play-by-play of the worst 40 years of my life?! It&#39;s been 573 years, but it&#39;s still too goddamn soon. JALAKÅRA knows my mind’s only a fraction of what it was from the acid.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Paulsen:** Perhaps just the Cliffs Notes.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-4922-Prime:** A 10,000 meter tall Witch-Queen ate me with a fistful of other humans, digested me, shat me out with the rest, and told me to come back again sometime when I got some better seasoning.
&gt; 
&gt; You can call it Corbenic all you want, but it&#39;s hell, and everybody - good, bad, whatever - goes to the same hell. Three Moons are the only people looking out for the little guy in all the sand, blood, and teeth. I wanted to help them do that, and if helping them means helping their divine intervention and/or secret police BS, then so be it. 
&gt; 
&gt; They saw use in my puppetry for defending the colonies. They saw a big enough imagination for the psychotronics division to weaponize. So that&#39;s when I made the logical next step in all this. I spent my time among the living touching the hearts of good people.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Paulsen:** And now you can terrify the hearts of evil people.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-4922-Prime:** Bingo. Look, Dr. Paulsen - between you and I, your Foundation&#39;s going down the toilet. But I&#39;ve been watching your actions through this puppet for a while. The boys in psychotronics R&amp;D could use a bright mind like yours. Whaddaya say? Pay&#39;s better. You get a free vacation decade when you sign up. And your mom misses you!
&gt; 
&gt;  **Dr. Paulsen:** My mother is dead.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-4922-Prime:** Eeee-xactly. How about it? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Paulsen:** No, thank you.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-4922-Prime:** Still not convinced, huh? How about I take you on a tour of the place?
&gt; 
&gt; [ SCP-4922-Prime self-destructs, killing Dr. Paulsen in the explosion. ]
