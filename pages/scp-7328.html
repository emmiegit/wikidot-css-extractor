**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7328-A&#39;s remains are in cryogenic storage at Bio-Research Area-12, and may be accessed for study upon request.

SCP-7328-B is in standard Anomalous Item storage. Recordings of all communications it received while active, and translations thereof, are available upon request.

**Description:** SCP-7328 is an immense interstellar spacecraft of unknown origin, currently located an estimated 2.5 astronomical units from Earth. The object&#39;s distance and low reflectivity have made the details of its size and appearance difficult to ascertain, but initial observations determined that SCP-7328 was decelerating along a brachistochrone trajectory that would place it in low earth orbit by [DATA EXPUNGED].

SCP-7328-A was a cephalopod-like extraterrestrial organism assumed to originate from SCP-7328. See Necropsy Report 7328-A-1 for further details on its biology.

SCP-7328-A was discovered when RAISA received a notification that a secure terminal at Site-01 had been accessed with O5-1&#39;s credentials while O5-1 was known to be elsewhere.[[footnote]]It is not clear how SCP-7328-A acquired O5-1&#39;s credentials or infiltrated Site-01; antimemetic properties are suspected.[[/footnote]] When Mobile Task Force Alpha-1 (&#34;Red Right Hand&#34;) arrived at the terminal, they discovered SCP-7328-A&#39;s remains. The organism had apparently been terminated by the Berryman-Langford memetic kill agent when attempting to access the [[[SCP-001]]] document; however, terminal records indicated that it had successfully accessed ████ other documents[[footnote]]including [[[SCP-231]]], [[[SCP-2317]]], and several other highly-classified Keter- and Apollyon-class objects[[/footnote]] beforehand. 

SCP-7328-B is a cylindrical, metallic communication device extracted from SCP-7328-A&#39;s corpse. It is likely that, via this transmitter, SCP-7328-A relayed some or all of the classified information it accessed back to SCP-7328. The operation of this device is not well understood, nor is the means by which messages are transmitted between it and SCP-7328. SCP-7328-B continued receiving transmissions after SCP-7328-A expired, possibly indicating that the same messages were being sent to multiple SCP-7328-A instances.

43 minutes after SCP-7328-A&#39;s death, SCP-7328 abruptly changed course and began accelerating out of the solar system. SCP-7328-B stopped receiving messages at this time, and its power source failed soon thereafter.

After eleven months of work with both anomalous and non-anomalous methods, SCP-7328&#39;s last transmission to SCP-7328-B was finally translated.

&gt; WHAT KIND OF PLANET IS THIS

Further translations indicated that all remaining SCP-7328-A were recalled to SCP-7328 via teleportation before it departed. As such, SCP-7328 has been reclassified as Neutralized.
