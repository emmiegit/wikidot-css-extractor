**Item #:** SCP-5757

**Object Class:** Euclid

[[include component:image-block

    caption=SCP-5757-A containment monitoring operations.
]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** A cartridge containing SCP-5757-A&#39;s data has been hardwired into an Atari Jaguar games console, in order to obtain a consistent video stream. Video output by SCP-5757-A is subject to algorithmic monitoring in order to ensure its accuracy.

Wildlife agents have secured the perimeter of the Everglades Agricultural Area C-139 Annex with unauthorized persons being refused access under the guise of ongoing restoration work.

Any attempt by SCP-5757-affected individuals enthralled by them to exit the C-139 Annex are to be repelled; lethal force is authorized for these efforts.

Attempts to recover those affected by SCP-5757 have been discontinued. Lethal force is authorized to enact these procedures, if that becomes necessary.

**Description:** SCP-5757-A is the data for an unreleased and unfinished piece of software. Entitled &#34;Curse of the Everglade&#34; it is written with the [[[scp-5032| ICRDTA]]] programming language and is only compatible with original Atari Jaguar hardware.

The game world of SCP-5757 appears to correlate directly to approximately 15,000 acres of land within an Everglades Agricultural Area, hereafter referred to as SCP-5757-B. Actions taken within SCP-5757&#39;s game space can and will change the physical landscape, topography, and population of SCP-5757. 


[[include component:image-block
    name=modified.jpg width=350px|
    caption=SCP-5757 video output during testing, depicting Agent Decourcey addressing several alligators.
]]

Any sentient or sapient entities within SCP-5757-B, including humans, will be represented as spherical sprites by SCP-5757-A. Within the game space there is a persistent text bubble displayed above any human-representing sprites, giving information on their status, mood, and occasionally brief transcripts of their vocalizations.

However, to date, it has proven impossible to play SCP-5757-A directly through the console - instead, it is believed that the game is played remotely by the first individual to gain physical access to SCP-5757-B with knowledge of its connection to SCP-5757-A.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Transcript of Video Cassettes 9-18&#34; hide=&#34;Access Granted&#34;]]

&gt; Found by urban explorers in an abandoned Miami-Dade home. The VCR containing the tapes had been recording a television set, which burnt out prior to the discovery.
&gt; 
&gt;  A Foundation front posing as a video restoration service subsequently acquired the tapes. 
&gt; 
&gt; Restoration of the recording tape is ongoing. Only a few short segments are possible to view clearly.


&gt; **&lt;Begin Log A&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; //(Three units enter the game setting, followed by another two, and all continue until they reach three trees present at the centre of the game setting.)//

&gt; //Note: It is believed this tape documents events which took place days or months following Log A. Exact timing has yet to be determined.//

[[collapsible show=&#34;Research Analysis&#34; hide=&#34;Access Granted&#34;]]

&gt; Initially, we assumed that the threat from Subject 5757-1 would only grow as a result of it becoming more accustomed to its new capabilities. We did //not// anticipate the threat that would result from those capabilities expanding. I am writing, of course, of the skill tree that we found in the data of SCP-5757-A. As Subject 5757-1 expands its settlement and continues killing the local wildlife, it is gaining &#39;experience&#39; - and it&#39;s using that experience to make itself more powerful.
&gt;
&gt; So far, we know it has access to these skills:
&gt;
&gt; * **Skill Share:** Skills possessed by one unit are shared by all controllable units. This is why they&#39;re all able to proficiently use the weapons they have access to.
&gt; * **Vital Boost:** All of the units are much more durable than ordinary human beings - they move faster and hit harder, too.
&gt; * **Revive:** If a living unit can get to a downed unit within a minute of it losing all its health, the downed unit can be revived.
&gt; * **Fine Control:** We&#39;re fairly sure this is the latest skill Subject 5757-1 has acquired. Previously, SCP-5757-1&#39;s commands were limited to simple things like &#39;go here, move this there, attack this&#39;. Now, we&#39;re not certain of the level of control it can achieve.
&gt;
&gt; The next skill to be achieved is **Animal Call** - which allows the player to recruit animal units as well as human ones. If Subject 5757-1 achieves control over //all// the local wildlife, I don&#39;t think I need to say how much more difficult containment will become.
&gt;
&gt; Tracking the rate of experience gain, we&#39;re fairly sure that Subject 5757-1 will unlock this skill in five days time. If we&#39;re going to eliminate this threat, this is our last chance.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Expedition Summary&#34; hide=&#34;Access Granted&#34;]]

&gt; Mobile Task Force Delta-43, &#34;Quarter Junkies&#34; was mobilized on 1/16/2019 to carry out the neutralization of Subject 5757-1. All communications were broadcast through soundproof headsets with microphones.
&gt; 
&gt; Operational goal was to locate SCP-5757-1, activate targeting beacon, then retreat to a safe distance while HQ shelled the area. Equipment was standard for subtropical/jungle environments.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lent:** We&#39;ve crossed through the perimeter. Check in, everyone. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Decourcey:** One Quarter Junkie, Quebec, uniform, alfa, romeo, tango, echo, romeo...
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Davie:** (//Interrupting//) Checking in, and Decourcey I&#39;m very proud that you can remember your phonetic alphabet.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Jesup:** Jesup, checking in. Apparently I&#39;m the only one who can remember his name.
&gt; 
&gt; **HQ:** {{Roger. We hear you all loud and clear.}}
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Davie:** What&#39;s the game showing, command?
&gt; 
&gt; **HQ:** {{You should be clear to proceed with caution.}}
&gt; 
&gt; (//Approximately fifteen minutes of silence//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lent:** Careful, Decs. Surprise keeps us alive.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Decourcey:** Sorry. Didn&#39;t see the branch in all the river grass. You think they heard anything?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Davie:** Command, how&#39;s our target looking? Still sitting pretty?
&gt; 
&gt; **HQ:** {{No behavior changes. They still appear to be building.}}
&gt; 
&gt;  **Agent Jesup:** Stop. Davey, there&#39;s a weird bug on your shoulder.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lent:** Squash it. We&#39;re going to have to get this stuff dry-cleaned anyhow.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Jesup:** Squashed. Let&#39;s go.
&gt; 
&gt; (//Approximately one hour of silence//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lent:** Command, we&#39;ve got a problem. We&#39;re at the point, but not seeing any targets.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Jesup:** Doesn&#39;t look like anyone&#39;s been here in a hundred, two hundred years.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Decourcey:** Very scientific.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Jesup:** Bite me, Decs. I&#39;m trying here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lent:** Shut up. Command, what are you seeing?
&gt; 
&gt; **HQ:** {{You should be able to see their position. What are you seeing?}}
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Decourcey:** Mangroves, cypress trees, cypress knees, an orchid here, lot of mosquito. Expected fauna, no signs of habitation.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lent:** Wait, where&#39;s Davie?
&gt; 
&gt; **HQ:** {{Davie, check in.}}
&gt; 
&gt; (//Silence//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lent:** Dang it. Dang it. Shit. Fuck. Pull back, this isn&#39;t good.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Jesup:** We have to stay.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lent:** Jesps, what&#39;re you-
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Decourcey:** We have to stay.

&gt; 
&gt; //(Agent Lent enters into an unknown structure within SCP-5757-B. Agents Decourcey, Davie, and Jesup are escorting, all are believed to be affected by SCP-5757.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject 5757-1:** Bring me the buzzard bait. I wish to parlay with its masters.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lent:** Hello Kurt. You-
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject 5757-1:** //(interrupting)// Your information is out of date. Address me as the Jaguar King.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lent:** ...right. Well, Jaguar King. You want to talk about... your swamp?
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject 5757-1:** You&#39;re very arrogant to -
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Decourcey:** //(interrupting)// - come into my kingdom -
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Davie:** //(interrupting)// - and make assumptions.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lent:** Neat trick.
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject 5757-1:** //(shouting)// No!
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Jesup:** It isn&#39;t a some party trick.
&gt; 
&gt; **All Subjects:** (//In unison//) Respect in the power of the Jaguar King.
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject 5757-1:** Prostrate yourself.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lent:** I&#39;ll pass. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5757-1:** Worm. Shut your mouth. You&#39;re not to speak unless spoken to.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Jesup:** In here, you do what I want, better than you could ever do on your own…
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Decourcey:** …so what was the point of you even being born outside at all?
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lent:** That&#39;s a big question - I&#39;m not really equipped to answer it. Doesn&#39;t make any sense, anyhow. None of this does.
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject 5757-1:** I -
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lent:** //(interrupting)// These are good boys you&#39;ve got here, Kurt. Let &#39;em go, and maybe we can all walk out of here on two feet.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause.)//
&gt; 
&gt; //(All Subjects begin laughing, continuing for ten seconds before suddenly stopping.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject 5757-1:** You think so? As if this unit means anything to me. Go ahead. Take a gun and, and, shoot me in the head! See if I care.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lent:** I have to admit, it&#39;d be satisfying. But we&#39;ve still got a mission to do.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Decourcey:** Oh, I see, I see.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Davie:** I see.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Jesup:** I see.
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject 5757-1:** I see. What a noble sacrifice. Useless? Also boring. If you&#39;ve got nothing to parlay, then you&#39;ll have to go. Even if you shot everyone here, it&#39;s not like this is all I have at my disposal. Did you think that I was that stupid?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lent:** Is that a no?
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject 5757-1:** Of //course// I&#39;m not that stupid!
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lent:** No - my offer. Is that a no? Think carefully.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject 5757-1:** //(quietly)// Of course it&#39;s a no, you stupid shit.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lent:** Alright. //(Target beacon activates)// Eat shell, you sonofabitch.
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject 5757-1:** You don&#39;t scare-
&gt; 
&gt; //(Feed cuts out.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
