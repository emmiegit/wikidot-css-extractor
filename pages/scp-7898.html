++++ ADVISORY TO FOUNDATION PERSONNEL 

Requests to transfer to SCP-7898 are to be approved by Dr. Belfair. Transfer requests lacking proper authorization will not be added to the wait list.

**Special Containment Procedures:** All 122 existing instances of SCP-7898 are currently held in a specialized atrium habitat in Site-109. Upper atrium windows of SCP-7898’s containment are to be uncovered for a minimum of 5 hours per day, adjusted on overcast days to provide SCP-7898 sufficient sunlight. Atrium windows are to be covered and the containment area filled with aerosol sedative during Blood Sun cycles. Any new instances of SCP-7898 and SCP-7898-1 are to be incinerated. The town of Fields Spring has been demolished and its existence expunged from public record.

**Description:** SCP-7898 is an arachnoid parasitic creature that inhabits human bodies for locomotive and reproductive purposes. SCP-7898 nest in dark, dry, enclosed spaces, most commonly inside the walls and crawlspaces of houses, and subsist on sunlight [[footnote]] Non-predatory UV light [[/footnote]] in a process similar to photosynthesis. 

SCP-7898-1 instances are the full human bodies used by SCP-7898 for locomotion. SCP-7898-1 instances retain the ability to move and speak similarly to non-anomalous humans, but lack many bodily functions including eating, drinking, and waste expulsion. SCP-7898-1 instances also seem incapable of experiencing or expressing negative emotions, even in response to physical pain or megadental events. 

SCP-7898 themselves measure between 15-25cm in length and typically weigh between 4-6kg [[footnote]] Non-sentient kilograms [[/footnote]], depending on the age of the host, with six legs visually similar to a spider [[footnote]] Observers specifically mentioned similarities to the non-anomalous horseeater spider [[/footnote]]. While any of SCP-7898’s original sensory organs are not visible outside the carapace, observation suggests that SCP-7898 navigates using smell and hearing when not attached to an SCP-7898-1 instance. 

SCP-7898 was originally discovered in the town of Fields Spring[[footnote]] Located in the area formerly West Virginia [[/footnote]]. There were no survivors.

**Addendum 1 - Life Cycle of SCP-7898**

Based on discoveries from both Field Springs and Foundation experimentation, the observed life cycle of SCP-7898 is as follows. 

**Phase 1:** A mature instance of SCP-7898 will hide within the hollow walls of a building, most frequently a house, where it waits for a suitable host.

**Phase 2:** The instance will break through the drywall from within, grab the head of the host, and use a sharp appendage to implant an egg in the host&#39;s ear.

**Phase 3:** The host experiences mental fog, manic episodes, head/neck pain, and neck muscle weakness.

**Phase 4:** The host feels compelled to keep their head inside small, dark places, such as under blankets or in containers.

**Phase 5:** The host will force their own head through a wall, life signs cease.

**Phase 6:** The host&#39;s head rips off at the neck and arachnoid appendages of a fully mature SCP-7898 instance emerge from the mouth, ears, and throat.

**Experiment Log**

|| **Experiment** || **Result** ||
|| Extracting SCP-7898 egg from host after implantation || Failure, host subject brain death ||
|| Denial a suitable nesting space to a growing SCP-7898 instance || Subject attempts to break head through concrete wall, dies ||
|| Consumption of SCP-7898-1 instance || Subject becomes severely ill and expires, SCP-7898 reclassified to Class W74 Inedible Corpse ||
|| SCP-7898-1 instance taken outside during an rending event || SCP-7898-1 instance increases dramatically in physical strength, infects 2 accompanying personnel before being terminated. Instance remains incinerated ||
|| Exposure to unfiltered fresh water [[footnote]] Treated as to not dissolve its container [[/footnote]] || No notable effect beyond ordinary chemical burns ||
|| Exposure to untreated seawater from the Panarctic Ocean [[footnote]] Treated as to fit into the building [[/footnote]] || Integrates with the water, becomes transmissible through any physical contact with the water as evident by multiple cases among attending staff. Water sample destroyed ||

&gt; //Note: This anomaly has been marked as a primary candidate for the developing Salvation Initiative, a program to temporarily reassign recently traumatized researchers to safer, less stressful anomalies, due to its low staff death rate and similarity to mundane and ordinary phenomena.//
