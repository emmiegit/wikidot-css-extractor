A Hispanic man suddenly appeared in a room filled with smoke, alarms, and an Italian man. Beyond the massive hole in the corner of the room, he could see a river cutting through a green valley, stretching towards a forested horizon. 

The Italian man looked back and smiled as he saw his new vistor. &#34;Oh, hey, that was fast,&#34;  he said as he discarded a piece of paper. &#34;Long time no see, [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2855 money bags]. Care to take a seat?&#34;

Mr. Money smiled and walked towards the table, taking a seat next to [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-644 Mr. Hot]. &#34;It&#39;s been a while.&#34; 

&#34;Heh, well, neither of us could ever stay in one place for long. That&#39;s not us.&#34; 

&#34;How did you even get me here?&#34; 

Mr. Hot chuckled to himself. &#34;Called in a favor from an old friend.&#34; 

&#34;What kind of friend?&#34;

&#34;A collector,&#34; Mr. Hot said, then noticed a dark shadow creep across Mr. Money&#39;s face. &#34;Don&#39;t give me that look! I know you won&#39;t believe me, but I think he&#39;s sorry.&#34; 

&#34;Sorry? Him. I find the prospect...unlikely. What even were the terms?&#34; 

&#34;Chump change. $5. A measly amount even I&#39;d have in this place.&#34; 

&#34;I don&#39;t mean what you paid for. I mean what were the terms. For me.&#34; 

Mr. Hot raised an eyebrow. &#34;You mean you can&#39;t tell?&#34; 

Mr. Money was silent.

&#34;I&#39;ll take that as a no then. Well! As of now you are officially my personal liqour locker. You can and will give me whatever drink I request at any moment.&#34; 

Mr. Money stared at Mr. Hot.

&#34;So c&#39;mon. Gimme the booze.&#34; 

Mr. Money sighed. &#34;You and I both know that we&#39;re not allowed to drink.&#34;

Mr. Hot fell slumped back into his chair. &#34;Well, hell, he would probably make an exception for, you know-&#34; He gestured towards the hole. As if on cue, flowers began to bloom across the field. &#34;Yeah. That.&#34;

&#34;No.&#34; 


Mr. Hot smirked. &#34;Do you really not know what the terms were?&#34; 

&#34;No, I do not, which is exactly the reason why I&#39;m still asking you.&#34; 

&#34;You&#39;re free.&#34; 

&#34;What?&#34;

&#34;You&#39;re free!&#34;

&#34;What do you mean?&#34;

For the second time that day, Mr. Hot raised his eyebrows. &#34;Do I have to spell it out for you? You&#39;re not bound by anything anymore. That contract there was your last. For real this time.&#34;

&#34;I-what?&#34; Mr. Money said, clearly taken aback.

&#34;I figured it was the least I could do, after all we&#39;ve done. I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s only for...&#34; Mr. Hot glanced towards the newly flowered field, &#34;however long we have left. But at least you can be you.&#34;

&#34;Huh,&#34; was all Mr. Money had to say. 

They sat in silence for a while.

&#34;So,&#34; Mr. Hot said, breaking the tension, &#34;Are you going to stop it?&#34;

Mr. Money closed his eyes in thought and took a deep breath in, deep breath out. He opened his eyes. &#34;No...don&#39;t think I will. This is the last stop.&#34; 

Mr. Hot turned to face Mr. Money. &#34;You know, you always went on about that. About your &#39;last stop.&#39; But you know what? I don&#39;t think it is.&#34; 

&#34;Well then what is it?&#34;

&#34;Well...I don&#39;t //know// per say but...&#34; 

&#34;Let me guess. You&#39;ve got an idea?&#34; 

Mr. Hot made finger-guns. &#34;Bingo.&#34; 

&#34;Well then, let&#39;s hear it.&#34; 

Mr. Hot stared out towards the setting sun. &#34;Well, it //is// the last stop. The flowers are proof enough. But only for now. Just because the train is at the end of its route doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s never going to set out again. And maybe, just maybe. After this stop. This train&#39;s gonna get a brand new set of tracks to ride on.&#34;

Mr. Money let out a quick grunt. &#34;You seem pretty sure of yourself.&#34;

A sly grin covered Mr. Hot&#39;s face. &#34;What can I say? I&#39;ve never been wrong when it came to stuff like this.&#34; 

Mr. Money had a smile of his own creeping up his face. &#34;No, you never have, have you?&#34;

&#34;I&#39;ve really missed you, you know that?&#34; 

&#34;And I have missed you. And you know what, that was a good idea you had earlier.&#34;

&#34;Oh? A compliment?&#34; Mr. Hot said. &#34;It really is the end of the world.&#34; 

Mr. Money let himself laugh, truly, for the first time in a long, long time. &#34;Cheers, to the end of the world. Let&#39;s hope that your friend really has changed.&#34; 

With those words, both of the men were holding a glass of vodka. Mr. Hot raised his glass. &#34;Cheers,&#34; he said, clinking his glass against his brother&#39;s.

Neither of them drank it. &#34;You know,&#34; Mr. Hot said, &#34;I think it would actually be a bad idea, to break the Old Man&#39;s rules now. How about some orange juice instead.&#34; 

Both men laughed as the drink turned to orange juice, as they watched the sun set one final time.
