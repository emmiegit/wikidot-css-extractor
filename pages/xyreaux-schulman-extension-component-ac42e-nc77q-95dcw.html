||~ Description||A peripheral for the [[[schulman-ny-programmable-mnestic-device-ac34d-nc77q-95dcs|Schulman-NY Programmable Mnestic Device]]] which allows the user to locate other instances of the subject&#39;s existence across a predetermined range of reality constructs. The device identifies the subject&#39;s Scranton signature and locates identical (or similar within a specified percentage) instances of their existence.||

|||||||| With sociopolitical tension in Zeta-01[[footnote]] An ungoverned city existing inside a pocket dimension in the Kuiper Belt with a population of approximately 25,000 as of January 2040.[[/footnote]] maxing out as the war worsens, most individuals are simply looking for an escape; while all other means involve relocating and abandoning personal ties, this item will provide a range of nearly identical options. The Xyreaux-Schulman Extension Component uses the same technology found in the SCP Foundation&#39;s Scranton Reality Anchors and Aetheric Resonance Imaging equipment in order to parse overlapping or similar reality constructs; through these means, it becomes possible to switch bodies with an instance of oneself from a separate reality construct.||
|||||||| Financial Note: My current limitations lie in the fact that a swap cannot occur unless it is completed using the same apparatus on the other end, meaning this service requires for our agents to track and temporarily detain the client&#39;s target instance in order to complete the process. The varying difficulty of physically accessing a reality construct dissimilar from baseline makes it nigh-impossible to market this service to most of Zeta-01&#39;s population, meaning a galaxy-wide product launch is unlikely until service fee parameters are developed.||

||||||||~ Memo 01||

||~ Sender || Xyreaux ||~ Recipient || Bruce Schulman Jr. ||
|||||||| It would be ideal to have you present here at some point soon to offer your input on this item&#39;s marketing, as well as the logistics of using it. I&#39;ve been asking around the Hitchhiker&#39;s Lounge (our brand-new Zeta-01 nightclub establishment, as I&#39;m sure you heard) for willing test subjects and have found three who are interested. One is human, and the other two are traveling friends who politely declined to disclose their origin planet. (However, they have a central nervous system and brain stem, which is all your device needs to perform its functions.) _
 _
I expect we will also receive complaints about the ethics of allowing an individual to control the fate of an instance of themself who is not aware of the situation. I expect some moderate-to-severe social fallout at the Lounge if I launch this here, likely even from our own members to some degree. Tweaking reality appears to be one of the few anomalous activities that still makes most uneasy.||

||~ Time ||~ User ||~ Message||
|| 00:57 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || Zee, you have a minute? ||
|| 00:57 || Xyreaux || Hey, I do ||
|| 00:57 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || Alright. Crazy busy down here, sorry. I have only about 5 until Carter shows up here. But can you tell me more about this device? I get the concept but I need to know if it works. ||
|| 00:57 || Xyreaux || I tested it on my inactive brain. There are only three other iterations of it that I&#39;ve found so far, but I&#39;m still perfecting the technique. But yes, it found them. ||
|| 00:57 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || You used it on yourself? How did that work? ||
|| 00:57 || Xyreaux || I used it on the extra brain my body doesn&#39;t use. It has its own cerebrospinal fluid. It&#39;s not really more than a pinprick to use this thing on yourself, to be honest. ||
|| 00:58 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || ...Right. I&#39;ll take your word for it. Well, that&#39;s promising. How about these people you found? ||
|| 00:58 || Xyreaux || Human from Earth, 36yo, and two crustaceans ||
|| 00:58 || Xyreaux || Is it rude to call them crustaceans? They&#39;re not really crustaceans strictly speaking. I&#39;m trying to put things in Earth terms here ||
|| 00:58 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || Carter can pull up the security feeds if I want to see what they look like. As long as they&#39;re healthy for their species and aware of the risks. ||
|| 00:58 || Xyreaux || Yes, and yes but you know the //risk// is that I don&#39;t quite //know// the risks. ||
|| 00:58 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || right ||
|| 00:58 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || It&#39;s fine as long as you&#39;ve told them what you&#39;re telling me. ||
|| 00:59 || Xyreaux || I did. The human said that she just wanted to &#34;try anything to get out&#34; because she&#39;d been traveling aimlessly since evacuating Earth. The other two won&#39;t say what planet they&#39;re from, but claim that a section of it was bombed and their families were killed in the process ||
|| 00:59 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || Oh hell, okay. ||
|| 00:59 || Xyreaux || So yeah, I have options. ||
|| 00:59 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || Alright. And you said you wanted me to come there? ||
|| 00:59 || Xyreaux || If you can, yes. I know you still have loose ends to wrap up down there before you can leave, but if this is the first place you come when you do, I won&#39;t complain. ||
|| 00:59 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || I can&#39;t leave [[[that-buzzing-behind-your-eye|the entity]]] yet. ||
|| 01:00 || Xyreaux || Understood. ||
|| 01:00 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || Can I give you a piece of advice on this? You won&#39;t like it. ||
|| 01:00 || Xyreaux || I would welcome it. ||
|| 01:00 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || Don&#39;t develop this off of my version. Do it off the Foundation&#39;s. ||
|| 01:00 || Xyreaux || Really? Why? ||
|| 01:00 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || ED-K. And the plugs and ports are identical between the model types anyway. ||
|| 01:00 || Xyreaux || Isn&#39;t that the programming language the Foundation uses for their androids? ||
|| 01:00 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || Not just their tech -- their living personnel too. ||
|| 01:00 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || ED-K++, the most up-to-date version of the language, is what their employees&#39; consciousnesses are composed of. [[[directive-a-42|And then hosted in a chip in their brains.]]] Hell, they did that [[[paperpushing|before]]] they thought to write their AI in the language, actually. ||
|| 01:01 || Xyreaux || I feel unobservant now. ||
|| 01:01 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || You&#39;re not. There&#39;s absolutely no way to notice it in interacting with them. No visual indication. ||
|| 01:01 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || (But it //is// mentioned in your hiring paperwork, under the &#39;Current Summary of SCPF Presence&#39; section...) ||
|| 01:01 || Xyreaux || You got me there. Apologies. I&#39;ll reread it. ||
|| 01:01 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || It&#39;s fine, I&#39;m not your boss. (Mostly.) And you do plenty, anyway. But yes, reread all of that, and see if you can get your hands on one of them. ||
|| 01:01 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || *your limbs(?) ||
|| 01:02 || Xyreaux || On one of their modified Schulman-NYs? ||
|| 01:02 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || And one of their personnel. ||
|| 01:02 || Xyreaux || Why? Won&#39;t they just cause a scene and try to capture me? ||
|| 01:02 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || I doubt it, at least regarding the capturing part. They no longer consider any non-Earth species to be anomalous like they used to. Some of their employees are sapient nonhumans. ||
|| 01:02 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || They&#39;re not really about containment anymore, you know. They&#39;re about money and expansion. ||
|| 01:02 || Xyreaux || I&#39;ll take your word for it, I guess. But look, I&#39;m not good at the &#39;direct action&#39; side of things. This sounds like a job for the acquisitions guys. ||
|| 01:02 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || (Carter&#39;s here, gtg sorry) ||
|| 01:02 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || To answer why: A consciousness already in a format a computer can interpret will make your testing infinitely easier. ||
|| 01:02 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || And they&#39;ll come to you, that&#39;s how. I&#39;ll approve this file for pre-sales listing in our database. ||
|| 01:02 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || With this part behind the proper permissions, of course. [[[autonomy-part-ii|Give it a few weeks.]]] ||

||||||||~ Memo 02||
||||||||~ AC42E/NC77Q/95DCW ||
||~ Sender || Xyreaux ||~ Recipient || Bruce Schulman Jr. ||
||||||||The only additional issue I&#39;ve noted since we spoke is the following: Not all instances of one&#39;s consciousness are the same. The identity of my secondary brain is at least three different species, and I&#39;m finding more instances still. I don&#39;t know if clients will find this problematic given the extenuating circumstances causing people to want this, but it&#39;s worth noting.||

||||||||Keep going. It&#39;s worth it. What we discussed previously will give you an easier operating method and potentially more stable results. Just wait for that, please.||
