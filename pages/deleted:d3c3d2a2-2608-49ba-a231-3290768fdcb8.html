**Item #:** SCP-6248

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6248 is to be kept in a basic SCP containment chamber. Whenever testing is to take place, one Class-D at max. Whenever a Class-D comes back, they are to be monitored until they are not exhibiting any effects from SCP-6248.

**Description:** [Paragraphs explaining the description]	SCP-6248 is a wooden door that is three meters tall and one meter wide. When entered, the player will be in an all-white room. There are words carved into a wall of the room that says &#34;Welcome, Player! This is a very fun series of games designed for maximum fun! Complete the games for a prize!&#34;.
    After two minutes of being in the room, the player will be teleported to a giant maze with checkered walls, no lights, and a sign that says &#34;Run Away&#34;. Once entered, the player will only have a flashlight. The Player will have to collect thirteen blue orbs while SCP-6248-1, known as &#34;Legs&#34;, is chasing them in the darkness. SCP-6248-1 known as &#34;Legs&#34;, is a tall entity, that only has tall legs and a torso with a mouth on it, When it catches its victims in the maze, it stomps them until they&#39;re immobile and then lifts them with its legs to devour the player alive. In the darkness, the player will sometimes see the eyes of SCP-6248-1 and will have to shine the flashlight at the entity so the player doesn&#39;t get terminated. If the entity gets too close, the player has to run away, otherwise, SCP-6248-1 will terminate the player. Once the player collects all thirteen orbs, they will be teleported to game two.
    Game two is the same maze as game one, except the sign says &#34;Hide n&#39; Seek&#34;. As the name suggests, the player has to collect ten orbs while trying to avoid catching SCP-6248-1. If the player sees SCP-6248-1, the entity will start counting to twenty. During this time, the player has to hide from the entity. SCP-6248-1 will look for fifteen minutes before giving up and letting the player seek. If the entity finds the player, it will chase the player for five minutes, if the entity cannot get to the player, then the cycle begins again. After collecting all ten orbs, the player will be teleported to the third game.
    The third game is a different maze every time someone goes in, the checkered walls are covered with eyes, and the sign says &#34;Walls are Watching&#34;. As the name says, the walls of the maze are constantly watching the player, as the three new entities chase them, SCP-6248-2 through 4. These three entities are all large walls without any eyes on them, guided by the eyes on the regular walls, they surround the player until the player gets squished to death. The three entities are different in some ways from the others. SCP-6248-2 has a mouth that communicates with the other walls to tell them where to go. SCP-6248-3 has hands that are used to grab the player. SCP-6248-4 is a normal wall with no noticeable features. The goal of the third game isn&#39;t to collect orbs, but just to survive for thirty minutes.
    After thirty minutes the player will be teleported to a black room with a door. After going through the door, the player will end up in front of SCP-6248, the door. All physical wounds will be healed once the player leaves SCP-6248, but only Class-A amnestics can treat the mental trauma. Any people who enter SCP-6248 and don&#39;t receive amnestics will be scared of any tiny things for the rest of their lives, but the person will be very joyful to be alive. Sometimes after coming back from the games, the players may become very violent and sometimes even kill people. This effect lasts anywhere from three days to a few weeks.
