If SCP-3340 designated beings induce behaviour deemed undesirable by Foundation staff all individuals known to be infected with the SCP-3340 strain are to be amnesticised until their memories of the SCP-3340 instance are totally and irreversibly erased. If an instance of SCP-3340 is deemed to be non-cooperative, aggressive or otherwise a threat to humanity, their documentation is to be destroyed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Description:&lt;/b&gt; SCP-3340 is the collective term for incorporeal, parasitic entities which are generated when a being is able to conceptualise their existence. Natural generation of these entities can be caused through various means such as imagination, but the majority of SCP-3340 instances documented have been spawned from tangible media – descriptive texts, audio and verbal communication. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SCP-3340 instances, once formed, cause the host to change their behaviour. Sympathy for SCP-3340 instances, along with personality changes is a distinguishing characteristic of SCP-3340 infection. Some instances are also capable of inducing sensation in the host such as causing various levels of hallucination, with one documented case of an SCP-3340 instance causing the host to feel pain. SCP-3340 instances have also been documented elevating dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin levels in those infected when aiding in SCP-3340 replication. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Communication with SCP-3340 instances can be established when its initial documentation is modified; post Incident-01, communication with SCP-3340 instances is to be established using iron filings over the documentation for ease of removal without damaging the media. Intelligence of SCP-3340 instances seems to be directly correlated with the character count of the media that spawned them. SCP-3340 behaviour has been correlated to the tone of the media that spawned them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Classical conditioning techniques have been implemented to prevent negative behaviours should they arise; failing the classical conditioning, destruction of the instance’s parent information will prevent further memetic spreading of the instance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Addendum A:&lt;/b&gt; Incident-01&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following an unrelated study on the physical degradation of an SCP-3340 spawning document, it was discovered that dust collected around certain words and symbols more than others. Analysis of the pattern created shows that the groupings were not random and instead formed coherent English sentences from the highlighted words. &#34;
