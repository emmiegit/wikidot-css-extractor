I can still feel the grin that was on my face, when the preliminary files were placed upon my desk. We&#39;ve only scratched the surface of indexing the information we&#39;ve found from it. Numerous subtle differences between this Branch&#39;s data encoding methods and the Unmasqued&#39;s have made it a slow, but not unrewarding, task.// ||
|| An electronic handheld game titled &#34;[http://www.scpwiki.com/quiet-days Doctor Wondertainment&#39;s Shooty Man&#39;s Vengeance]&#34; || Mundane world, where everything related to the Veil gradually disappeared approx. in the early 2010s. || Purchased from &#34;Meryl&#39;s Discount Thrifts&#34; in Soda Springs, Idaho. ||//What an undignified swan song for the Toymaker of this Branch. Even more troubling was discovering the fate of our brethren; slain by Madmen who then cannibalized themselves. What quieted this world?// ||
|| Two CDs of Alagaddan folk music covered by contemporary musical artists; a T-shirt labeled &#34;I&#39;ve got a Hanged King in my pants&#34; followed by an arrow pointing downwards. || Partially Veiled world, where the Kingdom of Alagadda was converted into an international &#34;tourist trap&#34; in the 1980s. || Purchased as part of a &#34;buy two, get one free&#34; sale at a gift shop. || //Fucking capitalism.// ||
|| Twenty stone tablets, with scripture in an unknown language etched upon it. || Veiled world, where innovations in written communication and currency were not established for reasons currently unknown. || Traded in exchange for a pen and five pieces of dried teriyaki jerky. || //The Linguists have been having the time of their lives attempting to translate these tablets. I&#39;m still annoyed Hopper gave away the pen I&#39;d loaned him in order to acquire them. Yes yes, I have thousands of them in my desk, but it was still rude.// ||

What could&#39;ve driven the Jailors to surpass both the Bookburners and Madmen in cruelty?// ||

Training for etiquette and safety when dealing with ##green|they who steal nouns## was immediately assigned.// ||

What if their attempts at &#34;scrubbing&#34; the vector were incomplete, or they intentionally lied about it? Hopper asked of me, &#34;These Jailors are in name only, run by ducks and swans, fighting their Egyptian patron. Why in the hells would they try to screw us over?&#34; We stared at each other for minutes on end, but I could think of no counterargument. I&#39;m still sending this to the Scanners; I will be taking no chances.// ||
