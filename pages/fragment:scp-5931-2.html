**Special Containment Procedures**: SCP-5931 is to be kept in a High Priority Item locker at Storage Site-5795. Access to the locker is restricted to personnel with Level 4 clearance only.

Testing of SCP-5931 is strictly forbidden.

**Description**: SCP-5931 is a Colt Official Police double-action revolver. A skull has been engraved on the left side of SCP-5931&#39;s grip panel. Cartridges of any caliber inserted into its chamber will be converted into black .22 Long Rifle bullets with a skull design identical to the one on SCP-5931&#39;s grip panel. SCP-5931 creates no noise when fired.

Based on information from Recovered Document 5931-1B and 5931-1C, SCP-5931 is believed to possess retrocausal properties which, based on the circumstance of its recovery, is activated when fired at a grave. The bullet will disappear before hitting the grave, temporally dislocated into the brain of the grave&#39;s occupant 70 years before the date of the activation process, causing a seizure that usually results in the death of the affected subject. This results in a retrocausal rewriting of reality; only the memories of people who have observed the use of SCP-5931 are unaffected. SCP-5931 can target an individual on a specific date by writing the date on the bullet before firing it.

Due to these properties, SCP-5931 is believed to have been responsible for the previous anomaly under the SCP-5931 designation[[footnote]]See document of the previous iteration of SCP-5931.[[/footnote]]. Due to the risks of further retrocausal effects on the temporal stream, testing of SCP-5931 is strictly forbidden.

**Recovery Log**: SCP-5931 was discovered by coincidence in the possession of one Leonard Di Fortuna by Agent Aerosol during an investigation into unrelated rumors of &#34;mobster specters&#34; at the Saint Michael&#39;s Cemetery, New York;  Agent Aerosol witnessed its anomalous properties when he saw Di Fortuna fire it at the grave of Irish gangster Owney Madden. Leonard Di Fortuna attempted to flee when Agent Aerosol gave pursuit, but collapsed dead mid chase. 

Investigations into Leonard Di Fortuna&#39;s apartment revealed a receipt for SCP-5931  (Document 5931-1A) from the auction of the assets of Mills Allon[[footnote]]the reclusive heir of the Allon publishing estate. No connections between Mills Allon and the anomalous had been discovered previously.[[/footnote]] and a stapled report titled &#34;Invention 033081&#34;[[footnote]]No author was mentioned[[/footnote]] (Document 5931-1B) consisting of a description of the anomalous properties of SCP-5931, leading to the discovery of its retrocausal properties. The journal of Leonard Di Fortuna (Document 5931-1C) was also found. Below is a relevant entry from the journal, which has been digitized.

&gt;  **18/12/2000**
&gt; 
&gt;  The mob still lives. The players have changed, the events slightly different, but still, it exists to haunt us.
&gt;  
&gt; When I saved my father from his killer before he could kill him, I thought I had found the weapon to destroy the mob forever, the organization that allowed his killer to walk free despite all the witnesses who saw him pull the trigger.
&gt;  
&gt; But it seems killing the mob is not as simple as taking out certain people.
&gt;   
&gt; I shot Lucky Luciano, before he could implement his plans to gain power through betrayal. 
&gt; 
&gt; The mob still lived.
&gt;    
&gt; I shot Carlo Gambino, the new Father of the Mob.
&gt;    
&gt; The mob still lived.
&gt;    
&gt; I shot Joseph Bonnano (who apparently without Carlo could finally implement his own plans to become the Boss of Bosses)
&gt; 
&gt; The mob still lived.
&gt; 
&gt; I shot Frank Costello, and just for good measure, his favorite legbreaker Albert Anastasia. Surely, I thought, with the Prime Minister of the Underworld and the Lord High Executioner dead, the mob would be deprived of visionaries to lead it to prominence.
&gt; 
&gt; I was wrong. The mob still lived. But this time, in Irish hands.
&gt;   
&gt; But that means something: change is possible. With all the Italian mobsters I killed, the Irish mobs remained in power in New York. So as long as I take out their visionaries, they too might shrivel away.
&gt;   
&gt; It will be hard, though: my knowledge of the Irish mobsters is not deep, and searching through the journal, none of the entries I find have helped. And who knows if killing off the Irish mob will be the end of it: New York also had prominent Jewish-American gangsters. 
&gt;  
&gt; But as the end of the Italian-American mob in New York proves, nothing in time is fixed: the Mob is not some important spoke in the wheel of time. And I will do all that I can to remove it entirely from history. Even if I have to spend hours on research and driving. Even if I have to kill a hundred. One by one, I shall bring down their leaders, their visionaries, their Washingtons.
&gt; 
&gt; The mob harmed my family once, in a time that no longer exists. I will make sure they harm no other.
&gt; 
&gt; I will be doing my research tomorrow on the new mob: the electricity here is out because of a sudden strong storm. The weather has been extreme lately, though if my own journal entries are any indication, this apparently is not considered unusual in this timeline.
&gt;

An autopsy on Leonard Di Fortuna revealed a bullet lodged in his brain, with no discovered point of entry. The bullet bore a skull design matching those of SCP-5931&#39;s.</textarea></pre>
