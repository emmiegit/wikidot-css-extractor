* Overview
Jeju-do is the largest island in Korea. Due to the island&#39;s isolation, Foundation administration and operations on Jeju are relatively detached from mainland Korea and tend to be interconnected with each other. Complex-13K is the provincial complex covering operations in Jeju Special Self-Governing Province&#39;s entirety, where individual facilities are administered under a single site to adapt to Jeju&#39;s unique geography.

* History
October 1950, during the Korean war, following Operation Chromite and the resulting United Nations Forces&#39; reclamation of modern-day South Korea, the Foundation sought to expand its influence outside Site-02K of Busan. Starting with [[[open-fire#toc1|Independant Port-03K]]], the Korea Regional Command founded secure facilities on various United Nations occupied territories. Being one of the rare locations free from Communist threats, Jeju was deemed an optimal ground for a Foundation complex. Naturally, the land next to Altteureu airfield was picked as new land for Foundation facilities, which will serve as a refuge of Foundation assets at potential future political instabilities in Korea. Site-06K served as the sole operations head of Jeju from its foundation of 1950 to 1960.

Jeju of the 1950s was home to many paranormal events rooting from the island&#39;s rich mythology and the recent uprising of 1948. Site-06K, built for wartime purposes, was sturdy but had an inefficient layout, and its land and structures were rather small. Due to such problems, Site-06K soon showed signs of overload. To resolve this situation, the Korea Regional Command planned to build additional sites across the island. Former Sites 06K and 15K administered South Jeju Gun, former Site-13K was built in Jeju-si, and former Site-34K was built in North Jeju-Gun, allowing the Foundation to disperse anomalous entities in the facilities effectively. Former Site-13K was of the most importance, as it was located near the newly opened Jeju International Airport(formerly Jeongtteureu Airfield). Consequently, Site-06K, which lost its role as the aerial transportation hub after the closing of Altteureu Airbase, gave its place to Site-13K as the primary site of Jeju.


Throughout the years, the sites have adjusted their jurisdiction in conjunction with district changes in Jeju, such as the installation of Seogwipo-Si of 1981, and the 2006 Jeju&#39;s designation as a Special Self-Governing Province. These efforts included building subbases on Wu-do and Mara-do, as an act of further vigilance against paranormal threats. As Jeju entered the 2010s however, events such as the surge of floating population, mainly tourists, historical sites of Japanse colonialism turning into tourist hotspots, and the military port building brought an alarming increase of anomalous events. Moreover, the attacks by [[[beyond-entropy-hub|Beyond Entropy(BE)]]] under the slogan of Jeju&#39;s environment preservation caused fragmented administration and fatigued individuals, eventually leading to the point where the Foundation cannot function.

In 2015, after negotiating with BE, Korea Regional Command decided to unify and reorganize facilities scattered around Jeju to normalize efficiency. Under the instruction of former Executive Advisor Seol Semyoung, the four sites were simultaneously disbanded and redesignated. Former Site-13K became the main compound, 06K the west compound, 15K the east compound, 34K the Halla compound, under the newly formed Complex-13K. The appointment of Dr. █████, then director of the old Site-13K as the new Complex-13K director marked a successful end of the reorganization process.

January 2019, [[[SCP-953-KO]]] breached containment at the main compound of Complex-13K. Fortunately, casualties were minimal, and no other SCP objects or facilities were damaged. However, the death of the site director left many people in shock. Acting Site Director Seol Semyoung was appointed in Dr. █████&#39;s place and was tasked to reevaluate the containment of all SCP objects in the island, including SCP-953-KO. In 2020, Complex-13K is composed of five main facilities including the Marine Observatory built in 2019, and three sub facilities.

* Mobile Task Force Units
MTF Unit Zeta-4 (&#34;Rock Army of Tamla&#34;) was founded as a unified MTF unit of former Jeju sites. Each facility has security and guard units stationed to deal with tasks on a minor scale. Zeta-4 is stationed in the main compound and the Jeju Naval Port Detachment and is dispatched when major incidents beyond the individual facility&#39;s breach occur.

Zeta-4 Terrestrial Combat Company, AKA &#34;the Oreum Force&#34;, specializes in mobility, wielding many types of equipment necessary for immediate dispatch. The equipment includes helicopters, motorbikes and light armoured vehicles. Also, the company stocks enough supplies to support operations when needed. The Oreum Force, the most elite Foundation force in Jeju, manages most anomalous situations and combat against hostile groups.

Zeta-4 Marine Combat Company, AKA &#34;the Wadang Force&#34;, uses three high-speed boats[[footnote]]SCPS Gapado, SCPS Biyangdo, SCPS Chagwido[[/footnote]]. Its main job is to regularly patrol the coastline of Jeju searching for anomalous events, and undertaking initial response following the marine observatory&#39;s intel. Limitations in ship size make it hard to picture an all-out naval war, but the company is a force to be reckoned with. In 2010, when paranormal security situations became unstable, the Wadang force successfully protected the coasts of Jeju in conjunction with the 5th Task Force of Independent Port-03K. In 2014, SCPS Gapado drove off the BES Narwhal by firing Gatling cannons and ramming it.
