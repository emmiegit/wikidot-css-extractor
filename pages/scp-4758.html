**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-4758 are to be kept within cryogenic storage along with the severed hand all SCP-4758 instances were found with. Instances of SCP-4758-1 are currently being located and terminated by MTF Omega-15 &#34;Bag and Tag&#34;. If an SCP-4758-1 burrow is found, the location is to be reported to MTF Capt. Edward Myers. As of 20/02/2019, all Site-82 staff are to be scanned monthly for any tumorous growths within the heart and brain.

**Description:** SCP-4758 is a series of ten letters either written by or sent to a Charles Lafitte.[[footnote]] No historical data on this Charles Lafitte has been found outside of SCP-4758 instances[[/footnote]] Due to each SCP-4758 having a different anomalous property and said effects not being major enough for a separate SCP designation, each has been given a sub-designation ranging from Letter 1 to Letter 10. Letter 1, as of this writing, is conclusively non-anomalous.

SCP-4758-1 are the individuals that have read either Letter 10 or certain excerpts from Communication Log 4758. SCP-4758-1 undergoes a three-stage development cycle, which takes place over the span of five years. 
The first stage of development takes place over the span of three years. Affected individuals become paranoid and often develop mental disorders such as insomnia or Alzheimer&#39;s disease. The only physical identifying feature of SCP-4758-1 at this stage is a group of small tumorous growths within the brain and heart ranging from four to seven centimeters in diameter.

The second stage of development takes place over the course of one year. The affected individuals undergo a full tissue conversion and begin to produce large amounts of SCP-4758-1 tissue[[footnote]] SCP-4758-1 tissue functions as muscle, bone, fat, and neural tissues[[/footnote]] until it has grown to be roughly three meters in diameter. The body structure of SCP-4758-1 is generally described as larva-like.

During the final stage of development, SCP-4758-1 will begin secreting a mucus through its pores; currently, the purpose of this mucus is unknown. Two sets of large arm-like structures will sprout from the front and back of SCP-4758-1. After the final stage of development SCP-4758-1 instances will dig burrows where they will enter a state similar to hibernation.

**Discovery:** SCP-4758 was discovered in [[span style=&#34;background: black; color: black;&#34;]]Normandy[[/span]], France during a Foundation raid on a sect of the Serpent&#39;s Hand. Reports filed after the raid stated that only one-fifth of the Serpent&#39;s Hand sect were present. SCP-4758 instances were found held by a hand severed at the wrist. Due to the unusually well-preserved condition of the limb, it was treated as potentially anomalous and brought back for testing.

As of 05/09/2016 several dead instances of SCP-4758-1 have been found within the Serpent&#39;s Hand area of operations.

**Addendum 4758-1:** 

||~ Destination ||~ Summary ||~ Intended Recipient ||~  Anomalous Properties ||
|| Letter 1 || A letter stating that Charles will soon be married to a woman named Abigail. || Unknown family members. || None. ||
|| Letter 2 ||  Makes mention of Charles seeing a strange man near his home. || Abigail Lafitte. || --None.-- Subjects gain one-way communication with Charles from reading Letter 10 after Letter 2.[[footnote]] --See Communication Log 4758 for more information-- Destruction of physical copies of Communication Log 4758 are currently ongoing. [[/footnote]] ||
|| Letter 3 || A post physical letter stating that Charles has tuberculosis. || Charles Lafitte. || Subjects holding Letter 3 for an extended period of time report feeling weak and difficulty breathing. ||
|| Letter 4 || Makes mention of Abigail being pregnant and Charles&#39;s fear of death. ||Unknown family members. || Subjects report hearing a woman screaming after reading Letter 4.  ||
|| Letter 5 ||  A description of Charles&#39;s nightmares. At the end of the letter, Charles states &#34;Father, I am ready and I am willing. I will admit, I am quite anxious, but I know the ceremony is a great honor and I am grateful that you have chosen me.&#34;. It should be noted that Letter 5 is written entirely in Latin. || [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4756 Father.][[footnote]] The identity of Father is currently unknown; however, the name Father is most likely used in a religious connotation.[[/footnote]] || If separated from other instances of SCP-4758 and/or not held by the hand for five hours Letter 5 will catch fire; the fire can not be extinguished by any means other than placing Letter 5 in the hand with the other SCP-4758 instances. ||
|| Letter 6 || A post physical letter stating that Charles will die within weeks. || Charles Lafitte. || Subjects holding Letter 6 rapidly develop coal worker&#39;s pneumococcus causing subjects to expire in minutes. ||
|| Letter 7 ||A letter stating that Abigail has been killed and the fetus was extracted from her womb and that Charles is ready for the ceremony. [[footnote]] While the exact contents of Letter 7 through Letter 9 are unknown due to their properties, summaries have been made up from various documents found after the Serpent&#39;s Hand raid. [[/footnote]] || Father. ||  Reading Letter 7 activates a cognitohazard causing total organ failure. ||
|| Letter 8 || A set of instructions for performing a ritual. || Charles Lafitte. ||Reading Letter 8 activates a cognitohazard causing total organ failure.||
|| Letter 9 ||Possible information on a Sarkic cult.[[footnote]] Little documentation of Letter 9 has been found; however, references to &#34;The Profane&#34;, a derogatory term used for Sarkic cults, have been found in all Letter 9 documentation. [[/footnote]] || Unknown. || Reading Letter 9 activates a cognitohazard causing total organ failure. ||
|| Letter 10 || The summary of Letter 10 has been expunged due to its effects. || Unknown. || Reading Letter 10 triggers the SCP-4758-1 transformation process. Any form of documentation of Letter 10 has the same effects.||

[[tab Letter 1]]
Father, please read this letter to mother. I know this letter will bring her joy.

Today is the greatest day of my life for I have finally gotten the perfect ring. Within the next month I will be married to Abigail, and I want nothing more than for the family to come to France for the wedding. The churches here are beautiful. I eagerly await your visit.

- Charles
[[/tab]]
[[tab Letter 2]]
Abigail, please wait. I&#39;ve seen a strange man poking around the house, when I approached him he spouted some blasphemous nonsense about living forever. Said I was special, or important, or some such. I&#39;m going to make sure he never steps foot near our family ever again. Don&#39;t worry, we will be together soon. I haven&#39;t forgotten my promise, or our child. I will personally come and bring you to our new home, but only once I know this man isn&#39;t a threat to our family.

- Your beloved, Charles Lafitte
[[/tab]]
[[tab Letter 3]]
Charles, I regret to inform you that you are terminally ill. You have something known as tuberculosis, treatment isn&#39;t available but the best course of action is to come to my office and get an injection every so often. Stay somewhere warm and dry, but I would recommend spending time with your family because it may be the last time they ever see you.

- Dr. Morrison 
[[/tab]]
[[tab Letter 4]]
Father please read only the first half of this letter to mother, I don&#39;t want to worry her.
Abigail is pregnant, soon I will be a father. I am both anxious and proud of this new prospect of life. I have names in mind, but I will tell you the name of our child when the time comes.

I am ill. I don&#39;t know how long I have left to live, but it is likely that my child will not have a father. For the first time in years I am terrified. I&#39;m hiding this from Abigail, I love her but I simply don&#39;t want her to worry. I fear what awaits me, I fear St. Peter&#39;s judgment. I may have a way to get better, a man that has a cure for all earthly ailments. I will try his cure, and then I may be able to avoid the grave for some time longer.

- Your son, Charles
[[/tab]]
[[tab Letter 5]]
Father, what I must do has been haunting me. I know that I must not tell Abigail where I have been and what I have been doing, but the dreams make it difficult. I wake up screaming in the middle of the night and I have to lie to my wife, my beloved. Lying to Abigail makes me feel sick, sicker than when I had my first taste. I know I must forget these feelings so I may live on, but I can&#39;t simply forget about my love. I require your guidance once more Father. Every night, the same dream, the same horror. I awake in a field of fire then cover myself in the blood of Abigail. I cut open her womb and devour what is left of my first born.
When the time comes, I shall do what must be done. The thought alone makes me sick, but for the ceremony I shall overcome these feelings.

Father, I am ready and I am willing. I will admit, I am quite anxious, but I know the ceremony is a great honor and I am grateful that you have chosen me.

- Your chosen, Charles Lafitte

[[/tab]]
[[tab Letter 6]]
Charles, your health is declining at a rapid rate. You&#39;re paler than I have ever seen you. The shaking is what worries me, you say it&#39;s because you&#39;re hungry but I am a doctor. I know that hunger will not cause you to shake. At this point, rest will not help you. It is my professional opinion that you will die within weeks. Say your goodbyes and settle any debts you may have. I am sorry that you have to receive this news, I wish there was something more I could do for you.

- Dr. Morrison
