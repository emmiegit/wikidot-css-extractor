I heard the damnedest thing last week, I was wallflowering at an AWCY meet up in Boise (//the fuck is with that town anyway?//) – sipping on a scotch I stole from the bar when no one was looking – and I hear this posh arsehole going on about the Foundation.

Fast forward a couple days, and I’m walking into a satellite facility for Site-19 – //OMEGA something or other, who knows// – I’m doing my thing, nobody sees //Nobody// if I don’ want em to… Yet again, I’m a wallflower: I’m in the staff cafeteria, sipping at some bloody awful caffe, and there it is, some answers. A researcher by the name of Sanderson, she’s listing off all the things what died in the IMPASSE (//need to remember that//):

Well her colleague thinks, maybe those things what died would come back now that the juice is back.  But Sanderson, she just proved it ain’t true… because she mentioned 2521 and you can’t even mention that fucker without it coming for you far as I know.  But that ain’t her point.  Her point is, some of these things needed magic (//or the anomalous or whatever//) to fucking live.  Even if they were some sorta entity, they lost the sauce… they went bye bye.

I follow her to a lab and she kicks a couple researchers out. She makes eye contact with me at least once, but I went all null mind - read about it from some samurai stuff - and she lost me again.

Sanderson pulls up some files from the hard drive and pours over them, all to do with the Impasse, and stares at her screen for a couple hours.

**Classified Security Level-4**
//Aftermath of the resolution of the Impasse//
[[/=]]

To all Department and Site Directors:

From what we can tell, the entropic cascade of the Impasse has ceased. Those anomalies which survived the crisis are regaining their anomalous properties, but the rate is variable. For example, we have reason to believe that Corbenic has not fully regained its anomalous qualities; the same goes for those that reside in that reality. 

Needless to say, we can breathe a bit easier. The O5s have declassified the events that took place in and around the Impasse, and how the four artifacts are being used to reverse the crisis. 

Time to resettle into our own lives and let the relief sink in. There’s still work to do.

Overwatch has also assured me personally that the central cause of the crisis is unknown, and may never be known.  The official file will read as such. As difficult as it will be to say this, no further research into the crisis is to be allowed without special dispensation from Overwatch.

We’ve had two break-ins at the main office in the last few days, the first on the day Moose sent out the all-clear for the crisis. 

I was reviewing security tapes, because whoever it was didn’t leave so much as a scrap of DNA behind, and wouldn’t you know it... there’s a blank spot, roughly person shaped, rifling through my files. MY FILES. 

And this happened twice! //Nobody// stole our files, and it seems like a direct response to whatever the hell Overwatch did in their secret pow wow.

Dan, Jesus. Calm down. Come to my office after you’ve read the following document. Just a warning, I’m inserting a cognitohazard keyed to only allow you to view it. Anyone else will have a bad day.

Read it and we’ll talk... but obviously, this is bad news. It’s our fault. And if it gets out, which intelligence says it has, that puts a fresh target on our backs.

**Classified Security Level-5 OVERWATCH RESTRICTED**
[[/=]]

We’ve incarcerated “O5-0” in the Keter wing of Site-01. They’re to have no contact with anyone, outside of a minimum of two Overwatch personnel or their proxies. This means we can visit them, but never alone. 

We’re keeping Zero at Site-01 for further notice, because we want easy access to them. Zero still knows a lot about the crisis and they’ll be useful to keep around, so the execution is pending indefinitely.

Zero knows we caused this. So, we can’t let them out, but also they don’t want to see it happen again so I’m sure they’ll be helpful should a new crisis emerge. We never should’ve let them free in the first place but that’s the fault of the Founding Overwatch. Anyway... whoever is up for the interrogations, let me know.  Zero is a hell of an intelligence asset, we need to mine them for all they’ve got.

[[/div]]

&gt; **Wanker**: Sorry to bother you, ma’am but I can’t help noticing how hard you are to notice.
&gt; 
&gt; **Me**: Oh, that’s too clever. How fucking droll.
&gt; 
&gt; **Wanker**: Quite. Well, I’m Ignatius Dugan, volunteer Docent. Is there anything I could help you find?
&gt; 
&gt; **Me**: Ah, yeah. Sorry bout all that. I’m not too keen on people coming up on me like that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Wanker**: I should think not, what with your condition.
&gt; 
&gt; **Me**: Yeah, my “condition” is part of the reason I’m here actually. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Wanker**: You want to learn about the “Nobodies” then?
&gt; 
&gt; **Me**: Christ, so there is more than just me? You’re the second person in a day what referred to others. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Wanker**: Yes, of course! Your mentor didn’t teach you about it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Me**: No mentor, far as I can remember. Just me, like this, couple of years now. Speaking of, why isn’t it affecting you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Wanker**: Thaumaturgy. When someone comes into the Library, she knows. And while I’m volunteering, she’s very chatty about new patrons, especially those that seem lost.
&gt; 
&gt; **Me**: Thaw me what?
&gt; 
&gt; **Wanker**: //[Sighs.]// Magic, my dear. It’s magic.
&gt; 
&gt; **Me**: //[Under my breath.]// Well, why not just say that then?
&gt; 
&gt; **Me**: So, yeah I could use some help.  On the “Nobodies.”
&gt; 
&gt; **Wanker**: As you can probably imagine, there’s not a lot of scholarly work done on you and your colleagues. Not outside the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nobody-hub  | Foundation]]] that is.
&gt; 
&gt; **Me**: Not a chance you have some of their stuff on the subject, then?
&gt; 
&gt; **Wanker**: You’d be surprised, I can show you. But, your best bet would be to seek information out at the source.
&gt; 
&gt; **Me**: What’s that supposed to mean?
&gt; 
&gt; **Wanker**: Well, just last week there was another of your ilk here in the Library. I spoke with him at length. He was very interested in the death of magic recently abated and anything to do with Foundation hierarchical structures. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Me**: How the hell does that help me? Could be bleedin anywhere by now.
&gt; 
&gt; **Wanker**: I know exactly where he is... or rather, where he’ll be, in two days time. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Me**: Well, that’s bloody convenient. Assume you’ll be wanting something in return for that info?
&gt; 
&gt; **Wanker**: //[Creepiest damn smile.]// Yes, quite so. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Me**: Spit it out then. And if you get pervy on me, I’ve got a fucking taser.
&gt; 
&gt; **Wanker**: Nothing so sordid. I’d like to know your name. Knowing the name of a Nobody, that must be some rare coin.
&gt; 
&gt; **Me**: Don’t got a name no more. Hence, Nobody.
&gt;

After that he’s chatting about Paris and I’m about ready to tell him to fuck off when he tells me that’s where the other Nobody will be. At the Cafe DuMornay, not three blocks from the Arc de Triumph, in two days. Meeting some friends, the Wanker says, at noon.

Right, so that’s sorted. He even shows me to a Way that’ll pop me out in the city. So, I’m sitting here looking over those docs in a cafe on the Seine, reading about how I ain’t so alone as I thought.

Funny thing was, before I left, I ask the bloke about this O5-0. And he clams right up, smile falling from his face. He wants to know what I know, and why I wanna know about them?

What the hell? I tell him: captured by the Foundation. Tried to warn them. Turns out the Impasse is all the Foundies’ fault, from their overzealous containment and what not.

Wanker gets a real serious look on his face. Says something about a Queen. But before I left him, he makes me promise to tell his friends what I told him. Sure sure, I promise, and then get the hell outta range of his silly cosplayer affectation.  Ignatius. Pfft. Faaaaaaaake.

There’s __so many__ of us.  If all these files from the Foundies are to be believed, I’m not even close to being the only one.  But what causes it?  What purpose do we serve?  If these files are taken at face value, people like me have caused all sorts of trouble, so it’s not like we just fade from the world because we’re not important.

I’ve been thinking.  And maybe it’s a coincidence, but from what I’ve been able to pick up from the “anomalous community” – to which I’m a stalker peeking in through windows – Foundies started sometime beginning of the 1900s maybe a little earlier.  Their earliest notes about us Nobodies start not too long afterwards.  Connection maybe?

Shouldn’t have worried, dude came right up to me. So, I’m standing against a wall, scoping out the cafe and I notice this void of attention. Streets of Paris are busy around here, tourists like schools of fish. And I can see them parting just a bit, like some shark is swimming through and they’re giving it space. But it ain’t a shark, it’s this guy. And he’s looking right at me. Whammy has no effect on the bloke. But I can see it all around him, the nothing. The instinct to look away, to not notice him.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Me**: Sorry, got hit with one of them cognitohazard thingies. Supposed to fuck with the memory, so notes is useful.

**Him**: Memory cognitohazards don’t affect us. Something about the identity quotient being missing. You’re probably good.

**Me**: Yeah well, I think I’ll be cautious.

**Him**: Ask away.

**Me**: What job?

**Him**: First, what do you know about yourself? The thing you’ve got.

**Me**: Nuthin, just blank spot in my memory and I’m flat out ignored by my family and friends. First couple weeks are rough, digging through refuse for food but eventually I figure out how to turn the whammy up and snatch from people without them even knowing I was there. Few more weeks and I figure how to do the same for cameras, having run afoul of the odd member of London’s constabulary.

**Him**: Right, well a lot of us even end up homeless. But you should’ve had a mentor, someone that led you into the life.

**Me**: Wasn’t no sodding mentor. This wasn’t with my consent. I ain’t got a fart’s notion of who or what did this to me.

**Him**: Huh. That’s not great. Okay. The basics. Everyone becomes a nobody for a reason.  Lack of social connections, or ramifications on the people around you is a good start but it’s not absolutely necessary. The purpose you’re given is the reason.  Now I don’t know all the ins and outs of how it works, but you’re the perfect spy and thief, and no one will know you’re there unless you’re really standing out. Which is hard to do with the uh, “whammy” I think you called it.

**Me**: I got that much handled, thank you.

**Him**: Sorry, of course you do. Um, but the purpose thing, you got a calling or some thing you’re working towards?

**Me**: Man, I just survive. Snuck into a few classified sites when I got the hang of the Foundies doing their thing. Watched em hoover up a whole town in Idaho when something fucky happened. They didn’t notice me so I just watched. Followed em back to a base and dug around in some files, figured out a thing or two.

**Him**: I bet. And it’s good you’re keeping your eye out. But far as I know, only way outta this gig is a bullet or completing your purpose.

**Me**: What goddamn purpose?  I told you, I’m just floating along ignorable and making zero fucking impact.

**Him**: Yeah, well, maybe I can help there.

**Me**: This about the Impasse then?

**Him**: In a roundabout way, yes. It’s more about the Foundies as you called them.

**Me**: It’s their fault, the whole thing.

**Him**: I’m aware. And it’ll only happen again because they put a bandaid over a gaping wound and then washed their hands of it. 

**Me**: Well, not completely.

**Him**: What do you mean?

**Me**: You been breaking into secured labs and shit and you don’t know?

**Him**: I didn’t find anything much about the Impasse, honestly. Which is why I went back.

**Me**: Okay, so there’s this geezer they call O5-0, actually couldn’t put a bead on their gender so them, not a geezer. Zero knew, like since the beginning – fuck knows how they’re still kicking around – tried to warn the Foundies this was gonna be the way it laid out. They didn’t listen. So, cue Impasse, end of the world and all that noise, and Zero comes back in to warn em again. Did something else too, stole some shit to try and take care of the problem. Anyway, they caught Zero and hold em for trial, in which Zero tells the Overseers or whatever what the deal is. Only way to make sure it don’t happen again is shut it down, the whole foundation. To their credit, half the overseers take Zero’s side. But not the tie breaker.

**Him**: Not only is the Foundation to blame, it’s willful. Where’s this Zero now?

**Me**: Site-01, only Overseers allowed in to talk with them. Figure they’re gonna torture them until the bastards have what they want. Whatever that is.

**Him**: Probably ways to stem the problem when it comes up again. Right.  Job just changed. 

**Me**: Oh?

**Him**: Here’s my friends now, they’re useful so we should get them up to speed. But real quick, yeah the job’s different than I thought. Far as I can tell, there wasn’t any of us before the Foundation started their containment. Earliest notions around World War I or so, putting it a few decades after the Foundation got started. I figure it’s our job to gum up the works, undermine their containment, shut em down if I can. But now, it’s a rescue mission.

**Me**: Just gonna waltz into Site-01 and snatch this Zero? You mental?

//He slides a gun across the table, little thing like what James Bond would use.//

**Him**: Maybe I am. You in?

//So I take the gun and slip it into me bag.//

**Me**: Fuck it. Yeah, I’m in.
