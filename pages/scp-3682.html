&gt; [http://www.scp-wiki.net/log-of-extranormal-events Extranormal Event] 3682 (EE-3682) was observed once and shows no signs of recurrence. Only this strong secondhand evidence, and a number of coincidences are currently known to the Foundation. 
&gt; 
&gt; EE-3682 has no containment protocols, and its designation as an object is maintained in such an event. This record is presented as evidence and warning in real time. Plans have been prepared as to how to prevent such a thing from happening again, and where it may happen, and what may have caused it.

**Event Designation:** EE-3682

[[include component:image-block name=church.jpg|caption=Site containing evidence of EE-3682.]]

**Preceding Events:** Evidence of EE-3682 was first considered based on further investigation into urban legends in Sakha, Russia referring to hitchhikers and travelers who asked directions to a town that did not exist. The traveler would refer to the scenery around the nonexistent town. No consensus or verifiable memetic properties have been identified, but locals sometimes refer to a town named Volodin, or Volodi, located in a valley in a grove of flowers.

&#34;Volodin&#34; may have been discovered in a region nearby matching the description. Located in the center of the valley is a dilapidated, 20 occupant church. No other signs of human occupancy in the 30 mi² area were detectable. Located within the church were a 15cm ivory knife located on the altar, a machete, a garbage can lid, a first aid kit, a satchel, a note, 9 VHS tapes, and the skeleton of a young woman (20) who is lying on her belly, positioned with her hand touching the altar. The altar was covered with a thin layer of congealed blood. The blood, when tested, was that of a human fetus. The blood has congealed in such a way that would suggest the object bled out there.

One resident of the town of Tomtor matched dental records and DNA of the corpse but otherwise showed no other signs of relation to it. The individual [REDACTED] did recall visiting the area at one time, but was not able to remember when.

VHS tapes were secured in the altar cabinet within the church. This space was nailed in and secured with duct tape. The tapes contain images of a town that is not currently known to exist. It is not known if the tapes were compiled to arrange a narrative. Due to damage of these tapes it is not known which order these events occurred in, if these events occurred.

**Item 0:** A note, in Russian.

&gt; It happened fast, I think. April 16th, 2018. It&#39;s happened everywhere. There was no warning. We don&#39;t know why this happened. If you find this, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be dead. My bones grind when I walk. It is excruciating. I am lucky I had access to my father&#39;s medicine.
&gt; 
&gt; The thing couldn&#39;t change me. Or something helped me.
&gt; 
&gt; If I succeeded, you need to find Iepureanu.

**Item 1:** Tape 1. Written in the center space is &#34;Ezekiel Valeriy Iepureanu, last seen in Moldova.&#34; The VHS is an overwritten copy of &#34;Homeward Bound&#34;.

**Item 4:** Tape 4. No markings. An entity is visible on each of the tapes, inter-cutting itself into the footage sporadically. The object resembles a destroyed human embryo, floating in a ball of black liquid several feet from the ground. The liquid pulsates but the figure itself is motionless. The eyes do appear to be functional, as the entity occasionally looks into the camera.

&gt; 
&gt; **Man:** Ah, yes. The Lord comes now for all of his faithful, and for those who at least did no harm, I hope. Hmm. But what can we say for them. I digress.
&gt; 
&gt; **Man:** If you&#39;re seeing this, GOOD! If you suffer well through the tribulation, you may just be worthy to serve the Lord our God later in Heaven!
&gt; 
&gt; **Man:** Ah, or you can say to hell with it. There&#39;s time for that.

&gt; 
&gt; Aerial view of the town. 5 white Mil Mi-28 and one Ka-52 attack helicopter appear in camera view, two carrying between them what appears to be sort sort of explosive. The markings on the device are identical to what Foundation assets in this region may use in such an event. One helicopter leads, and fires a missile at a clearing in front of it.

&gt; Fixed, close up view of a 10 meter area on the ground.
&gt; 
&gt; The ground is covered in burning, amorphic masses. What is visible in the frame has been completely altered, composed of entities and phenomena previously seen on the tapes. The camera slowly begins pulling away.
&gt; 
&gt; Soldiers, 10 in total, with insignia matching those of MTF Nu-6 and 8, &#34;Tachyon&#34;, and &#34;Wetwork&#34;, are rappelling down from the helicopters. Several of the soldiers are equipped with portable flamethrowers and grenades in addition to their standard issue rifles. As the visual radius expands, it is revealed that the area is the same town hall square.
&gt; 
&gt; A crew begins arming the device while a team sets a perimeter. Members of Nu-8 [DATA EXPUNGED] in preparation. The view from the camera is distant now, three blocks of the downtown is visible.
&gt; 
&gt; The camera is suddenly covered by a thin black film. An anthropomorphic creature composed of black liquid appears to have launched itself off of the camera and toward the group. The camera begins to fall. The entity is finally seen being shot, midair, and explodes.
&gt; 
&gt; Camera rotates rapidly while in descent. View swings down to reveal the ground; The earth is stretching as if it were organic material. The earth begins to &#34;rip&#34;, something similar to television static is visible beneath the seams.
&gt; 
&gt; The camera collides with the ground. A human&#39;s feet walk into the frame. A young woman holding a garbage can lid and a machete bends into view to pick it up. She is breathing heavily, watching over her shoulder. She is covered in blood, and black fluid.
