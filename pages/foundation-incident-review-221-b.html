[[tab Incident Summary]]
+++ Overview

**Incident 221-B** was a Class-A fatal security breach that occurred on 31 August ████ at Foundation Secure Operating Facility 221, colloquially known as Site-221. Much of the information available to the Department of Internal Affairs regarding Incident 221-B was extracted from security footage recorded by CCTV cameras throughout the facility, as no eyewitnesses survived the event itself. Per Foundation policy, the Department of Internal Affairs implemented a security lockdown of Site-221 shortly after receiving reports of the incident to prevent a possible information leak and to suppress panic. It is now understood that this decision resulted in significantly higher fatalities, as site personnel were confined to the facility and thus unable to escape despite the incident itself posing little risk to external Foundation assets. An internal review of the Department of Internal Affairs is ongoing. 

+++ Background

At 3:21 PM (local time) on 31 August ████, Security Officer Carl T. Michelson entered Site-221&#39;s auxiliary parking lot and security booth as part of his predetermined patrol route. Radio check-ins between Michelson and Site-221&#39;s Security Control Center (colloquially known as &#34;Control&#34;) occurred every five minutes in accordance with facility policy. At 3:25 PM, Michelson contacted Control and reported a 2-1, an internal radio code meaning &#34;all-clear&#34;. Five minutes later, at 3:30 PM, Michelson reported another 2-1 and proceeded down the south hallway towards the security elevators. He then contacted Control at 3:27 PM, three minutes prior to his next anticipated check-in. A transcript of the subsequent conversation has been provided below.

&gt; **Michelson:** Control, this is Bravo-5. Come in.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Copy, 5. Go ahead.
&gt; 
&gt; **Michelson:** I&#39;m at the employee elevators in the south hallway now, uh...looks like there&#39;s some sort of liquid on the wall. Blue in color, seems to glow. Unsure of the source. How copy?
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Copy. We see it on the cameras. Was it there during your previous patrol? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Michelson:** Negative. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** We&#39;re dispatching a support team now. Hold position, await further orders. Out.

Per Control&#39;s orders, Michelson held his position at the employee elevators until 3:36 PM, at which time a support team consisting of three additional security officers arrived. The team proceeded to collect a sample of the aforementioned blue liquid and removed it from the walls without incident. However, at 3:44 PM, Security Officer Kayla R. Rodriguez, conducting a patrol along the east hallway, contacted Control and reported a &#34;2-9&#34;, code for a possible security breach. Her dialogue with Control was as follows:

&gt; **Rodriguez:** Control, this is Bravo-2.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Go ahead.
&gt; 
&gt; **Rodriguez:** We have unidentified personnel proceeding down the west hallway towards the security living quarters. Repeat, unidentified personnel in west hallway. 2-9. Individuals appear tall, with black clothing and opaque face-masks. Unsure of intent or origins. Requesting new orders, over.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** We see no such personnel on CCTV, over.
&gt; 
&gt; **Rodriguez:** They just went past me, Control. We have a confirmed 2-9 here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Copy. We&#39;re gonna, uh...we&#39;re gonna wait for another report before we put the site in lockdown. Can you link up with Bravo-5 at the employee elevators in the east hallway?
&gt; 
&gt; **Rodriguez:** Affirmative. En route.

As indicated by Control, the unidentified personnel did not appear on any CCTV cameras despite the path reported by Rodriguez suggesting they would pass by several such cameras. Internal communication logs taken from the control center indicate that Control was skeptical of Rodriguez&#39;s report and hesitated to lock the facility down, or even dispatch additional security teams. At 4:04 PM, Rodriguez linked up with Michelson - by this time, the security team dispatched by Control to collect samples of the blue liquid had already left the area.

+++ Security Breach

At 4:08 PM, a struggle was overheard by Rodriguez and Michelson inside of one of the research offices in the east hallway. 

&gt; **Michelson:** Control, Michelson and Rodriguez reporting in.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Go ahead.
&gt; 
&gt; **Michelson:** Unidentified noises coming from one of the research offices in the east hallway...sounds like a physical altercation. Unknown aggressors. Hang on - 
&gt; 
&gt; //Michelson approaches the office.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Unidentified Voice:** ...are you? Oh, Jesus - fuck, somebody help me - oh my God - //[screaming]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Rodriguez:** What the fuck? We gotta go in there - 
&gt; 
&gt; **Michelson:** Control, we&#39;re moving inside.

At this point, Michelson and Rodriguez entered the office. The struggle they overheard had concluded by this point. A post-incident investigation of the office found much of it coated in a blue substance similar to that described by Michelson in his earlier encounter. Various broken items, such as vases and framed paintings, were scattered across the room. Physical tissue and severed human limbs were found placed in a crude pile behind a filing cabinet, with multiple lacerations along wrists and elbows. Fingernails, teeth, and hair samples were also recovered. A rapid DNA test performed by the analysis team was unable to identify the source of these physical samples. The exact events that took place during this struggle remain unknown. Michelson and Rodriguez subsequently failed to respond to any communication requests from Control.

No further incidents were reported until 7:08 PM the following evening, at which time security teams along the external perimeter reported seeing an unidentified individual dragging what appeared to be a subject in a body bag away from Site-221. No investigation of this incident was conducted due to the inherent confusion caused by the earlier incident.

[[tab Final Report]]
+++ DEPARTMENT FINDINGS

The Department of Internal Affairs has concluded the following:
* The entities described by Security Officer Rodriguez are believed to be Class-A reality benders, possibly originating from a dimensional shift experiment conducted at Site-221 one week prior to the incident. They appear to possess the ability to move through solid matter and may have intentionally collected human tissue samples for an unidentified purpose. It is notable that, for several days following Incident 221-B, strange &#34;lights&#34; and &#34;aircraft&#34; were reported conducting flights above Site-221, exhibiting many properties consistent with UFOs described by civilian personnel throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. 
* A sizeable amount of physical material, and possibly at least one intact body, was taken by these entities. None of the tissue remnants collected by the analysis team corresponded with the amount of tissue one would expect to find from a human body. Additionally, one of these entities was seen by a security officer &#34;dragging&#34; a corpse away from the facility shortly after the initial security breach.
* Security Officers Rodriguez and Michelson were either killed upon entering the office from which they heard a struggle or captured. The events that took place within that office and their fates remain unknown.

This incident is now classified as resolved. No further investigations are scheduled.
