&gt; Due to increasing reports of anomalous deviant appliances, a large variety of items have been discovered with anomalous effects considered to be too mundane for designation as SCPs. This document was created to, as opposed to the standard [[[Log of Anomalous Items]]], specifically compile a list of these deviant appliances.
