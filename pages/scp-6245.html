**Special Containment Procedures:** In order to suppress the true nature surrounding SCP-6245, a staff member is to be assigned to her on the night of October 31^^st^^ for the sake of trick-or-treating. A list of cover stories has been formed in order to answer queries civilians may give regarding SCP-6245&#39;s history.

In addition, the anomaly is to be provided confectioneries in order to comply with Foundation staff.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]SCP-6245 mostly prefers chocolatey goods.[[/span]] The sweets should be stored in [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-169 Site-169&#39;s] Mess Hall.

**Description:** SCP-6245 designates an intangible humanoid entity, draped over by a bed sheet. Standing at a height of ~1.4 meters, she identifies herself as 12-year-old &#34;Sammy O&#39;Brien&#34;.

The specimen manifests in the area of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sun-talk Prescott Valley] from 7:30 to 9:00 pm every Halloween night. She is capable of instantly transporting herself to different locations, though has only utilized this ability when trick-or-treating, teleporting to various homes throughout the settlement. It is unclear whether SCP-6245 is able to travel beyond the area immediately surrounding Prescott Valley.

SCP-6245 was initially believed to be a folklore myth spread throughout the city, eventually gaining the title &#34;Sweet Tooth Sammy&#34;. Civilians claimed to have spoken with the entity, though, due to the lack of evidence corroborating their statements, it was simply considered a mere hoax. This was the case until the events of **Addendum-1**.

Investigation into SCP-6245&#39;s background has been inconclusive. Per order of the Anomalous Entity Engagement Division (AEED), interviews with SCP-6245 have been discontinued.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]See **Addendum-2** for more details.[[/span]]

**Mayfield:** Hmâ€¦ I wonder how [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/employee-of-the-century Marcel&#39;s] holding up.

**6245:** Hello? Excuse me, miss.

//Mayfield looks up to see the specimen.//

**Mayfield:** Huh, what theâ€”

//Sammy holds her pumpkin-shaped bucket up to Mayfield&#39;s face, startling her.//

**6245:** (//Singing//) Trick or treat! Trick or treat! Give Sammy some sweets to eat!

//Mayfield takes a step back, looking at her surroundings.//

**Mayfield:** How did youâ€¦ (//inhales deeply//) how did you get here?

**6245:** You wouldn&#39;t believe me, but I teleported here.

//SCP-6245 raises both arms in the air. Mayfield notices how translucent they are and squints.//

**Mayfield:** Hold on, are youâ€¦

//Mayfield stares at the anomaly for a brief moment.//

**Mayfield:** (//Pause//) Are you //the// Sammy? Sweet Tooth Sammy, the ghost going around trick-or-treating at that nearby town?

//Sammy averts her eyes from Mayfield.//

**6245:** (//Quietly//) Oh no, are you one of //those// people?

//Mayfield raises an eyebrow.//

**Mayfield:** Pardon?

//The entity crosses her arms.//

**6245:** You know, those people who kept asking about how I died and stuff. I don&#39;t like it when they do that.

**Mayfield:** Ah, no. Don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t ask you any questions. I justâ€¦ (//pause//) didn&#39;t realize you //actually// exist. We thought you were just a rumor.

**6245:** Well, look at me, miss. I&#39;m right here.

**Mayfield:** â€¦I can see that.

//Pause.//

**6245:** So, are you gonna get me some candy, please?

**Mayfield:** Right, right, justâ€¦ give me a moment real quick. I&#39;ll be backâ€”

//Mayfield re-enters the building.//

----

//Footage was taken from the reception room.//

//Mayfield enters the area and hurriedly approaches the bowl of sweets resting atop the desk. Dr. Kirby Case is seated behind the desk, and raises an eyebrow at her.//

**Case:** I thought you were going home for the night, Melissa. Did you want a quick bite before heading off?

**Mayfield:** Ah, yes, well... how do I explain this?

**Case:** Hm?

**Mayfield:** Do you remember that one investigation a few months back? The one about Sweet Tooth Sammy?

**Case:** Don&#39;t tell me...

**Mayfield:** She&#39;s (//pause//) standing in front of the entrance as we speak. You can check the feed if you&#39;re not convinced.

//Case briefly checks the footage on their laptop, then laughs.//

**Case:** And here I thought it was a myth. (//Mutters//) Three months of research just for her to waltz over here.

//Case gestures to the bowl.//

**Case:** You know what? Just take the entire bowl. I&#39;m sure Sammy would love that. In exchange, though, do me a favor and keep her from causing any more problems, alright? We have to uphold the Veil, after all.

**Mayfield:** Oh, thanks! You can count on me, Kirby.

**Case:** Good luck!

//Mayfield takes the bowl and hurries out the front door.//

//Footage was taken by the Site&#39;s entrance.//

//Mayfield returns to SCP-6245, with the bowl of candy in her arms.//

**Mayfield:** Here ya go. Sorry for the delay.

//She pours the sweets into the container. SCP-6245 gasps.//

**6245:** Oh my gosh, this is amazing! So much candy.

**Mayfield:** Yup, and there&#39;s more where that came from.

//Once Mayfield is finished, Sammy checks the contents of her bucket.//

**6245:** There&#39;s Skittles, Twizzlers, gummy bears, lollipops, andâ€”

//SCP-6245 pauses and stares at Mayfield.//

**6245:** Reese&#39;s Cup?!

**Mayfield:** You like Reese&#39;s Cup?

**6245:** Like it? I //love// it! I love all kinds of chocolate candy. Only the sweet ones, though.

//The entity hops repeatedly.//

**6245:** This is the best Halloween ever! Thank you, miss. Thank you so much.

**Mayfield:** No problem, Sammy. In fact, don&#39;t you said you weren&#39;t okay with all those people over in town questioning you, right?

**6245:** (//Nods//) Mhm.

**Mayfield:** Well, starting next year, how about I accompany you while you&#39;re trick-or-treating? You know, to keep them from asking you anything.

**6245:** Really? You would do that for me?

**Mayfield:** Absolutely! As a bonus, I can even get you all the candy you want.

**6245:** (//Gasps//) Even the chocolate?

**Mayfield:** Especially the chocolate. All for you. What do you say?

**6245:** Yes, yes, a million times yes!

//SCP-6245 goes and briefly embraces Mayfield, laughing. This startles her once again. The specimen then takes a step back, gripping her container with both hands.//

**6245:** Okay, I&#39;ll see you next year, then.

**Mayfield:** I&#39;ll be waiting.

//The entity walks off. The two wave at each other.//

**6245:** Bye bye, miss! Thank you again!

**Mayfield:** Good night!

//Sammy de-manifests. A short moment of silence passes.//

**Mayfield:** (//Mutters//) She seemed like a nice kid.

@@Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â @@If you&#39;ve been around town, you might&#39;ve heard about this one rumor going around about some girl under a ghost sheet, trick-or-treating at random houses every Halloween night. This myth â€” eventually titled &#34;Sweet Tooth Sammy&#34; â€” led to conspiracy upon conspiracy on what her history was like. Since no one has ever claimed to have met Sammy outside of October 31^^st^^, as well as how many homes she can go to in a short period of time, it was a matter of time until some civilians came to think that an actual ghost was hiding underneath that sheet.

@@Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â @@A popular topic many have speculated on is how she died in the first place and ended up &#39;//haunting the streets//&#39; of Prescott Valley. Some have stated it was nothing to behold â€” such as natural causes or an unfortunate accident. Others have theorized more tragic fates for a girl like Sammy â€” such as a homicide or something even worse. Of course, people would be more attracted to how interesting the latter would be. Thus, the rabbit hole deepens.

@@Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â @@From the brief conversations I had with Sammy, I can tell that she was just a young girl wanting to get some candy since it&#39;s Halloween. She would often relay some of the most odd questions regarding her death from strangers she&#39;s not even familiar with. While Sammy does not want to discuss her past, I&#39;m sure she was as normal as any other girl her age, and that I shouldn&#39;t look into it too much.

@@Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â @@With that said, I hope you know when to stop while talking to someone like Sammy. If you feel you are making them uncomfortable, then pull back. They&#39;re not willing to tell you everything about themselves, no matter how acquainted you are. Sometimes it&#39;s best not to question it and give the girl her candy.
