**Item #:** SCP-7220

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7220 is to be kept in a keycard-accessible glass case with L4 clearance. SCP-7220 is to be kept down in Hall U, High-Value Containment at Site 22

**Description:** SCP-7220 consists of two parts classified as SCP-7220-A and SCP-7220-B. SCP-7220-A is a clear 1pt (473ml) plastic bottle with “Bottle Of Mending” inscribed in black text on SCP-7220-A. SCP-7220-B is a purple metallic liquid of an unknown compound held inside SCP-7220-A. SCP-7220-A anomalous property takes place when .5ml or more of SCP-7220-B is inside SCP-7220-A. SCP-7220-A replenishes its supply of SCP-7220-B at a rate of .5ml per day exactly. SCP-7220-B anomalous property takes place when SCP-7220-B toches any worn item. Depending on how much SCP-XXXX-B is touching said item SCP-7220-B will regenerate at a rate of 1% per .1ml causing lost material and missing components to regenerate.

**Addendum-7220-1:** SCP-7220-B has been used by the Foundation to repair and return items ranging from pocket watches, shoes, lighters, pens, pencils, and even the frame of a car. Most notably, it was used to restore the broken remains of Dr. Kaleb Roshwald&#39;s car after his suicide attempt. It is currently unclear why SCP-7220-B does not function on living creatures, though SCP-7220-A can still heal wounds inflicted upon them after death. SCP-7220-B has also shown the ability to fully restore an object that was previously repaired by SCP-7220-B but with a notable time difference. Foundation researchers are currently working on developing a way to store SCP-7220-B in an easily transportable form so that we can use SCP-XXXX-B on site.

**Addendum-7220-2:** In light of recent events involving SCP-7220, it has come to our attention that SCP-7220-B may not be entirely harmless to living organisms. There have been reports of SCP-7220-B being able to actually kill individuals, though there is no evidence to suggest this is true. We encourage all personnel working with SCP-7220-B to exercise caution when handling SCP-7220-B, as well as keeping it away from anything that can be considered living. If you feel that SCP-7220-B has harmed someone please report it immediately to your supervisor. As of ███/█/20██, SCP-7220-B is officially designated as danger to humans and other living things. SCP-7220-B is to be treated like any other dangerous object under strict supervision of Level 4 staff.</textarea></pre>
