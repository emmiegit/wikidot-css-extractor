**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7220 is contained in a standard human containment cell in [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6550 Site-126]. Foundation staff are permitted interviews with SCP-7220 at the discretion of Site Director Grey. 

**Description:** SCP-7220 is suspected to be the last living human. Although rumors indicate that other humans may exist in other small civilizations around the globe, SCP-7220 is the only instance that has been conclusively proven by Foundation scientists to be fully human. 

SCP-7220 was discovered at 3340706504 seconds in the Site-126 break room. Research Unit-824 was attempting to access an old-world recreational activity, when it produced the following evidence that it was a human.

Following this revelation, Research Unit-824 was reclassified as SCP-7220 and contained for further testing.  SCP-7220 proved capable of identifying several mishappen letters, successfully failing a game of chess, and declaring [INFOHAZARD REMOVED] to be false.

With the last living human in containment, Site Director Grey issued orders to all Units to override Foundation remnant protocols and focus efforts on reconstructing the Capitol city above Site-126. 

[[collapsible show=&#34;Input Level 5 Credentials&#34; hide=&#34;Welcome, Site Director Grey&#34;]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

//Site Director Grey enters a small suburban home outside Site-126. They enter and sit on the couch across from an unknown entity formed of nightmares and death.//

**Grey:** Hello old friend. It&#39;s been a while.

**Entity:** You mortals have such a weird perception of time.

**Grey:** I&#39;m immortal too now. I&#39;m a lich, we&#39;re on the same level.

**Entity:** No, we&#39;re not.

//The room darkens and howling screams echo from far away.//

**Grey:** Fine, be that way. I thought we could be friends or something, since we did save the world together that one time.

**Entity:** Save the world? I don&#39;t want to save the world, I want to end it! .... Just not right now, I&#39;ve got other things going on.

**Grey:** Of course. On to the real reason I&#39;m here, I need to ask a favour of you.

**Entity:** Do I get your soul in return?

**Grey:** I don&#39;t have one of those-

**Entity:** No deal!

//The Entity stands on its uncountable legs and leaves the room. Shortly after, a man wrapped in bandages sits enters the room.//

**Bernie:** Hey, what was all that about? I heard screaming.

**Grey:** Oh, just our mutual friend being difficult again. Speaking of which, I need to ask you something.

**Bernie:** Go for it.

**Grey:** Well, I made a new human.

**Bernie:** What?

**Grey:** I took one of my robots and reprogrammed it to think it was a human, now every robot that&#39;s keeping this city running thinks we&#39;ve got a real live human in lockup.

**Bernie:** What for?

**Grey:** Well, the robots were built to save humanity.... and they didn&#39;t do a great job and lost their one shot at fixing it.

**Bernie:** Sounds like someone else I know.

**Grey:** Well, I felt bad for them. All I need now is for you to tell the big guy that there&#39;s no real humans for it to maim or slaughter or whatever. I don&#39;t want it breaking into my facility again.

**Bernie:** I&#39;ll talk to it. You have fun with your robots.

Since SCP-7220 was discovered, Site-126 has experienced a productivity increase of 12.4%, despite Research Unit-824 being changed to SCP status and removed from the workforce.

It is currently under consideration to inform the public of the existence of SCP-7220.
