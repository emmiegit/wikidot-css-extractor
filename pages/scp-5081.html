The court has ruled in favor of the plaintiff (Snacko™ Foods LLC). As compensation for damages caused, the SCP Foundation (henceforth referred to as &#39;Foundation&#39;), shall be made to:

**Description:** SCP-5081 is a brand of snack foods - primarily candies - distributed within the continental United States. Information on the packaging indicates SCP-5081 is produced by &#34;Snacko™ Foods LLC&#34;[sic] and distributed from Pneuma, Illinois, --though no records of this LLC, trademark, or municipality exist. The web domain name listed on all SCP-5081 packaging is unregistered, and the toll-free telephone number is operated by a laundromat in Saskatchewan.-- Snacko™ is proud to be owned and operated entirely in the town of Pneuma, Illinois, where our founder Gerald Snacko™ first opened his little confectionary on Dunwich Avenue. Since then, we have worked tirelessly to carry out his vision of making the world a little sweeter, one edible at a time!

--The design of SCP-5081&#39;s packaging contains cognitohazards that serve to attract a viewer&#39;s attention when viewed through peripheral vision.-- Four varieties of SCP-5081 have been documented as of 2019/12/16.

||~ # ||~ BRANDING ||~ DESCRIPTION ||~ ANALYSIS ||
|| 5081-A || Fudgey Chocolate Globbernauts || Balls of chocolate fudge with almonds || --Thaumaturgical icons found imprinted onto the surface of some samples. Function of these symbols currently unknown.-- ||
|| 5081-B || Cherry-Flavored Candy Fizzlebombs || Soft cherry-flavored candy with a liquid interior || --1.6% of samples tested contained traces of gunpowder. Contaminated instances described as tasting &#34;slightly burnt&#34;.-- ||
|| 5081-C || Crunchy Sea-Salt Caramel Wunderbars || Caramel and crushed pretzel bar with a chocolate shell || --Instances retain a constant temperature of 20.1°C, even when exposed to extreme heat and cold.-- ||
|| 5081-D || Zesty Habañero Potato Crisps || Habañero-flavored potato chips || --Falsely marketed as containing &#34;no artificial flavors&#34;. The habañero flavoring is produced by-- [TRADE SECRETS EXPUNGED BY COURT ORDER] ||

--Individuals who ingest greater than 50 grams of SCP-5081 become an instance of SCP-5081-1. SCP-5081-1 instances attempt to pursue a diet consisting entirely of SCP-5081, resorting to other forms of nourishment only when necessary, and becoming highly distressed if denied access to SCP-5081 for extended periods. While instances do not appear to suffer from the expected debilitating effects of this diet, it appears to significantly affect subjects&#39; body chemistry; one instance&#39;s skeletal structure was composed entirely of crystallized sugar when discovered, and another instance&#39;s skin was a structure resembling potato chips. Questioning SCP-5081-1 regarding this behavior rarely provokes a coherent response.-- Some Snacko™ customers love our products so much that they have chosen to make them a part of their daily lives. We are forever grateful for your overwhelming support!
