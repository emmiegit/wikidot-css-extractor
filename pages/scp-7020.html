]]

**Item №:** SCP-7020

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Physical containment of SCP-7020 cannot be enacted at present, but is irrelevant due to its distance from Earth. Current protocols consist of constant observation via Orbital Telescope 47A. Information security is under the purview of operatives embedded in civilian aerospace agencies, who are to ensure that astronomical data relating to SCP-7020 is scrubbed of any irregularities.

Under no circumstances should SCP-7020 be visited in person. Exploration is to be conducted only via Mk. VII unmanned probes.

**Description:** SCP-7020 is an exoplanet located approximately 96 light years from Earth in the habitable zone of the 51 Eridani star system. Long-distance spectroscopic techniques indicate that SCP-7020’s environment is capable of supporting complex organic life, as well as sustaining humans without protective gear.

Further information is **LEVEL 5/7020** classified.

**Addendum 7020-01:** 

The first thing I remember is a thousand pinpricks across my body.

Well, no, pinpricks isn&#39;t exactly right. More like pins being pulled out, a hellish kind of acupuncture. And there was really only about fifteen. 

At the time, of course, that was the last thing on my mind. I didn’t know what was happening. Everything around me was dark. I tried to scream, but coughed a tube out of my throat. I jerked upright and cracked my head on a smooth slab of glass. Curved walls pressed in on me from all sides. Muffled sounds leaked in from somewhere far away, but I couldn&#39;t comprehend them. I was trapped. Entombed in cold steel.

Then the glass slid aside, and the harsh white light poured in.

||**Medical Bay 01 - Camera Feed**||
[[/=]]

//The medical bay is a sterile room. Its walls and floor are gleaming metal, lit by ceiling-mounted lamps. There is little medical equipment to be seen save for a series of lozenge-shaped pods placed along the far wall - ten in total. They are stasis capsules, designed to protect their occupants in suspended animation for as long as necessary.//

//Capsule 07 has opened.//

//An assortment of robotic manipulator arms — descending from a rolling gantry affixed to the ceiling — are operating controls on the side of the capsule. Abruptly, a human fist shoots from the capsule’s interior along with a rush of supercooled white gases; at this, the manipulators quickly withdraw, folding up in a manner akin to the legs of an insect.//

I hated to admit it, but the cold, unfeeling voice was right. Now that I was coming down off the adrenaline high, I could feel it: all my muscles were aching in unison. It was like I’d run a marathon and the soreness had only just caught up to me. I wasn’t even sure my legs could hold me up if I climbed out of the capsule.

I didn’t respond immediately. My daring escape from the pod had exhausted me. Instead, I sat cross-legged and stared down at the cold chrome floor, thinking. 

That little tidbit about the black hole should&#39;ve galvanized me into action, but I still wasn&#39;t sure I trusted the robot. And even though I didn&#39;t know my own name, something told me sympathy wasn&#39;t my strong suit. A sob story about incompetence didn&#39;t have much chance of swaying me. I should have bided my time until I got my strength back, then made a run for it.

So I&#39;m not sure what drove me to keep talking.

Before anything else, we dealt with my wounds -- Ash had torn me up something fierce when it pulled out the catheters and, to its credit, did seem sincerely sorry about that. Luckily, the medbays had plenty of bandages and disinfectant. Once I&#39;d stopped bleeding all over myself, we got to making preparations for the journey ahead. 

Step one: learning the layout of the ship that, with any luck, wouldn&#39;t end up being my tomb.

= [[image https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/689936960105611304/999896615089352764/unknown.png]]

For some reason, the design provoked a strange twinge of familiarity in the back of my head. At the time I didn&#39;t think much of it; I was apparently a member of the ship&#39;s crew, after all, and there were more important things to worry about. 

The green section in the center was the ship&#39;s bridge and the only one open to Ash. It contained four medbay compartments -- only one of which I&#39;d seen, of course -- and a server room that had survived mostly intact. Exits along the outer walls should have led to the ship&#39;s three wings, marked in red, yellow and blue. But therein was the problem: Ash, in its damaged state, couldn&#39;t arrange anything to open the doors itself. It couldn&#39;t even see past them. It was trapped, like a bird in a cage.

And that was where I came in. I&#39;d make all the dangerous trips while Ash literally rode on my shoulders the whole way; it whipped up some kind of backpack full of transmitters, batteries and electrical doodads, which it claimed would host its mind in portable form, letting it bypass the fact that it was locked out of the system. 

I wasn&#39;t an engineer, so I didn&#39;t pretend to understand the details. All I knew was our goal: if I could reconnect Ash to all three of its memory cores, one in each wing, it would be able to repair the //Durandal// before it completely broke down and killed us both. Not just that, it would know exactly where we were going and why. And it would be able to get into that room marked in purple -- the pilot&#39;s cabin. Deep inside, I even harbored a silent hope that it&#39;d be able to turn the ship around and cross those 62 light years back to home.

At my insistence, Ash also showed me where I could find some spare clothes in one of the other medbays: a tank top, shorts and an orange jumpsuit. I was beyond glad to get rid of that flimsy hospital gown -- though of course, being a robot, Ash didn&#39;t really understand why.

As per our agreement, Ash had one other detail to share with me, one that seemed comparatively minor. The ship&#39;s destination was still a mystery, but some parts of the database referenced it indirectly with a classification number: &#39;SCP-7020’.

I didn&#39;t know what it meant, and I didn&#39;t think it was important. I was wrong.

Wing Alpha was the Crew Housing wing. It featured dormitories for the crew, training grounds, and most importantly, a mess hall with automatic cafeteria.

I took a much-needed breather. Then I found a sink and washed the last of the food off my face. Once I was good and ready, and not a moment sooner than that, Ash and I headed to the dormitories.

After that whole catastrophe, actually finding the memory core was a surprisingly painless task. Ash had made me pack some tools -- screwdrivers, pliers and wrenches -- and at its guidance, I used them to pry a certain bolted panel off the wall. Inside was the memory core, a boxy device like a transformer nestled in a tangle of wires. Quick and simple.

**Ash.aic:** {{This is the third time you have asked me this question in the past twenty minutes.}}

**Dee:** Yeah, and I’ll probably ask it a couple more times. Because this whole comedy routine we have going right now? Where I have no damn clue how to work with machines, you give me a different command every two seconds, and together we fuck it up completely? It’s getting old.

**Ash.aic:** {{We are not &#39;fucking it up completely&#39;. You have actually done exemplary work thus far. I will regain full access to this memory core once you splice the frayed yellow wire back together.}}

**Dee:** … Huh. Okay, I guess.

//Cautiously, Dee twists the wires together, applies solder and seals the splice point with electrical tape. There is a sudden spark of electricity and she quickly pulls her hands back.//

**Ash.aic:** //(inaudible)//

**Dee:** Pardon?

//The seams of the memory core illuminate with a yellow color. Ash.aic speaks from Dee&#39;s backpack; simultaneously, its voice can be heard over the intercom system at a much higher volume.//

**Ash.aic:** {{That is much better.}}

**Dee:** //(Shouts in surprise)//

**Ash.aic:** {{I feel... unrestricted. I am back in the system, where I belong. And I can access far more of the database. Yes, I believe I understand now.}}

**Dee:** Jesus, that startled me. What do you mean? Understand what?

**Ash.aic:** {{This spacecraft was built by a global clandestine organization known as the SCP Foundation.}}

//Silence.//

**Ash.aic:** {{Their mission is the containment and study of anomalies; phenomena, objects or beings which defy the laws of reality. Their entire database is backed up within this ship and describes thousands of such items, although I can access very few of them at present. Our destination is SCP-7020: a habitable planet located 96 light years away from Earth. Details of its anomalous properties are restricted to a clearance I do not currently possess.}}

//Silence.//

**Ash.aic:** {{One would theorize that we are merely traveling to SCP-7020 in order to study the anomaly. However, I am doubtful that this is the truth, because of another discovery I have made: the //Durandal//&#39;s course is hard-coded. It cannot return to Earth.}}

//Silence.//

**Ash.aic:** {{What are your thoughts on this matter, D-823543?}}

//Silence.//

**Ash.aic:** {{D-823543?}}

**Dee:** Why do I remember that?

**Ash.aic:** {{Excuse me?}}

**Dee:** I remember it. The Foundation. The plan to visit SCP-7020. Project Voyager. Why do I remember it? 

//She grips her head.//

**Dee:** I don&#39;t even know what Project Voyager //is.// But I remember. There was this-- meeting. White-coated scientists, black-suited executives. Someone wanted to shut the project down, even though so much work went into it. They said it was too dangerous, there was this, this risk, of-- damn it, I&#39;m losing it again-- why can&#39;t I-- damn it!

//Dee shouts unintelligibly and strikes the wall with her fist. There is a brief period of silence.//

**Dee:** //(Quietly)// It&#39;s not... it&#39;s... gone. I don&#39;t...

**Ash.aic:** {{Please do not strain yourself mentally or physically. You will only cause yourself undue harm.}}

**Dee:** And what do you care? //You&#39;ve// got your memories back. 

**Ash.aic:** {{That is inaccurate, Personnel D-823543--}}

**Dee:** //(Shouting)// Don&#39;t call me that! Who am I really, Ash?! Tell me! Because my own fucking brain clearly doesn&#39;t know! 

//Pause.//

**Ash.aic:** {{I still do not know your identity or the reason for your amnesia. Without the other memory cores, my access to the ship&#39;s database is still limited. My reach has expanded, but not to what it once was. I recognize that this is an unsatisfying answer, and that it is not the answer you were hoping for when I reconnected to the network, and I am sorry for that.}}

//Silence. Dee looks away.//

**Ash.aic:** {{I want to help you. We will find the answers to your questions. Is that sufficient?}}

I didn&#39;t know anymore. That explosion of frustratingly vague memories had set my head spinning. I wasn&#39;t surprised that anomalies existed, that the Men in Black were real, because part of me already //knew.// I grasped at scraps of memory, bits of knowledge that felt foreign. What was Project Voyager? Why did I know it so intimately and yet not at all?

I wished I was like Ash, so I could just plug into a convenient mainframe and fix myself. I wished I didn&#39;t have to deal with my memory coming back in these infuriating trickles and drops.

Maybe then I wouldn&#39;t have to rely on the robot that I still didn&#39;t quite trust. But like it or not, I had no other choice.

Wing Beta was the //Durandal//&#39;s lab -- clean, sterile, and hopefully a breeze to get through. It boasted a set of what Ash called &#34;auto-fabricators&#34;, devices that could print a variety of useful items when given a few base elemental reagents. And it also stocked isolation suits, which we needed for a simple reason: Ash&#39;s new sensors had pinpointed a massive hull breach in Wing Gamma. In order to traverse the area safely, I&#39;d need my own source of air.

Ash was still locked out of the other two wings, but with its increased capabilities, we didn&#39;t need to rely on that clunky backpack anymore. Instead, it downloaded itself into a sleek-looking drone retrieved from a storeroom in the bridge. In the meantime, I devoured my first meal since coming out of cryosleep. 

Our respective tasks finished, we set our sights on the path ahead.

**Ash.aic:** {{You have been unusually quiet. I suspect your emotional state is still affected by the partial return of your memories.}}

**Dee:** I suspect you should talk about something else.

**Ash.aic:** {{Avoidance does not solve problems.}}

**Dee:** Yeah, well, neither does needling someone who wants to be left alone. You ever think of that, Ash?

**Ash.aic:** {{You are my ally. Whether or not you personally desire to confront this topic, I am broaching it for the sake of your well-bei-- Wait.}}

**Dee:** ... That supposed to be there?

**Ash.aic:** {{No. This is troubling. I will investigate.}}

//Ash.aic approaches the sealed doorway, bobbing around in the air as it taps into the local system and performs several diagnostics over the course of roughly five minutes.//

**Ash.aic:** {{I have unfortunate news: it appears the damage to the ship has caused several catastrophic chemical leaks within the laboratory. As a result, all access points have sealed themselves in order to prevent the rest of the //Durandal// from becoming compromised.}}

//Dee rubs her face with one hand.//

**Dee:** Of course this isn&#39;t going to be as easy as you said it&#39;d be. So how are we getting in?

**Ash.aic:** {{In this case, direct traversal of the laboratory without an isolation suit would be ill-advised.}} 

**Dee:** So //how are we getting in,// Ash? As I understand it, just giving up isn&#39;t an option.

**Ash.aic:** {{I am not certain. Do you have any input?}}

**Dee:** That&#39;s surprising. You&#39;re usually the one with the plan. Mm...

//She rubs her chin.//

**Dee:** Hey. Labs need to be well-ventilated, right?

**Ash.aic:** {{Yes. I believe I understand what you are thinking.}} 

//Ash.aic&#39;s drone turns to face Dee.//

**Ash.aic:** {{The air duct system in this wing should be both uncompromised and sized appropriately to fit a human. Furthermore, the room containing the memory core is hermetically sealed save for its air filtration system, and thus would be safe to enter in this fashion.}}

**Dee:** Yeah, that&#39;s what I was afraid of.

//Dee sighs.//

**Dee:** I&#39;ll take a little claustrophobia over getting eaten by a black hole, though. Let&#39;s do this.

**Dee:** ... Hey, Ash. Was that sarcasm just then?

**Ash.aic:** {{Potentially.}}

**Dee:** Hah. 

//Six minutes of silence, interspersed with continued sounds of metal clanking and occasional swearing.//

**Dee:** Got another question for you.

**Ash.aic:** {{What is it?}}

**Dee:** How long—

//She is interrupted by the muffled buzzing of an intercom activating.//

**Intercom:** INTRUDER DETECTED.

**Dee:** No fucking way.

**Intercom:** INITIALIZING &#39;NITROGEN FLUSH&#39; PROTOCOL IN TEN MINUTES.

**Dee:** Ash, why does this keep happening? Make it stop happening!

**Ash.aic:** {{The security system is on high alert because I am unable to steward the ship myself. Until I have full access to my memory cores, there is nothing I can do.}}

**Dee:** Fine! Tell me how I&#39;m making a twenty-minute trip in ten minutes, then.

**Ash.aic:** {{Move as quickly as you can while conserving your breath. I have no other guidance to offer. I am sorry.}}

//The section of Wing Beta being recorded is in serious disrepair. Sensitive equipment is broken and strewn throughout the area, and puddles of caustic chemicals bubble on the floor.

//Abruptly, a loose panel on one of the ducts dents outwards and breaks off with a loud clang; Dee drops through the gap.

**Dee:** No... //(gasping)// shit...

**Ash.aic:** {{That tank is filled with chlorine gas. You have no respirator. Run //now.//}}

//Dee bolts through the adjoining doorway. Ash remains behind, hurriedly floating to the door and interacting with its control panel; it is able to close the door just as the chlorine tank falls and breaks open. The debris strikes another tank on the way down, causing several storage tanks across the room to fall and rupture in a cascading effect; these contain, among other compounds, acetylene and liquid water. A chain of destructive chemical reactions begins.//

//An explosion rocks the frame. The drone is flung off camera. Chlorine gas billows up, obscuring the feed.//

[[/div]]


My chest burned, but I ran like hell. Behind me, the muffled roar of the blast echoed. I didn&#39;t dare to think about what had happened to the drone.

We had emerged from the ductwork close to the far end of the wing, and it wasn&#39;t long before I found the memory core, locked inside a riser cabinet. I pulled out my tools and worked in a desperate frenzy; ripping out bolts, flinging them away, splicing frayed wires and realigning transistors. It seemed to come naturally this time, as if Ash&#39;s dispassionate robotic instructions had stuck somewhere in my head.

My mind was barely on my work. The last thing I&#39;d said to Ash rattled around in there over and over. God, I didn&#39;t know what to think about that robot anymore. I was so sure I had it figured out -- it had to be using me, right? It was a cold chessmaster, and I was just a useful tool.

But then it went and sacrificed its drone to get me out of that mess. The mess I&#39;d made myself. It didn&#39;t make sense.

**Ash.aic:** {{Is there a reason it cannot be both?}}

//Pause — then Dee inclines her head, silently.//

**Ash.aic:** {{I do not believe I was programmed to feel loneliness. But I recall... yearning, after a time. The //Durandal// was quiet, empty. I longed for company.

**Dee:** Wh-- How do you figure?

**Ash.aic:** {{We are both missing our memories. We do not know why we are here. And... //(pauses)// Forgive me for overstepping, but I believe life has not treated you kindly either. It is plainly discernible in your natural hostility, your predisposition to distrust. Yet still you assist me.}}

**Dee:** So you do know how to be sarcastic.

**Ash.aic:** {{My interpersonal skills are improving as I regain my memory data. It is a fascinating phenomenon. However, I assume you would prefer me to get to the point: that being, I have retrieved more information about the SCP Foundation.}}

**Dee:** Yeah, you&#39;re assuming right. Go on.

//Dee sits against the wall, crossing her legs. She readies herself to listen.//

**Ash.aic:** {{Before I continue, there is a chance that this information will induce further recovery of your memories. Is that alright? I want to ensure you are prepared for it, as it was an uncomfortable experience the last time.}}

**Dee:** Yeah. Yeah, I&#39;m ready. Uh-- thanks for checking first.

**Ash.aic:** {{You are welcome. The information I have gathered primarily concerns the command structure of the Foundation.}}

**Ash.aic:** {{Is something the matter, Dee?}}

**Dee:** I remembered something else. Ash, what&#39;s a K-class scenario?

[[/div]]


The end of the world. 

That&#39;s what it was. That was the meaning of the sentence fragment that had popped up in my head when I thought hard enough about Project Voyager. Some anomalies posed so much danger that they could destroy the Earth, and the Foundation dealt with that so often, they had codified terms for it. Ash pulled up a list for me on a nearby terminal, and I read it over in a mix of horror and fascination. 

But why had I remembered that? What did that mean for //us?// 

It felt like there were puzzle pieces in my brain, tumbling around but never quite clicking. SCP-7020. The end of the world. Project Voyager, whatever it really was. The //Durandal,// a ship adrift in space that could never return to Earth.

I had a creeping suspicion of how they fit together, and I didn&#39;t like it.


[[div class=&#34;quote&#34;]]

**Ash.aic:** {{To tell the truth, I also had a suspicion we would come to an unpleasant conclusion. This does not dissuade me. I will simply need to call a janitorial servitor drone and clear a path through the laboratory before we can proceed.}}

Unlike the other wings, Wing Gamma&#39;s purpose was unclear, for the simple reason that it had been redacted to hell and back. All we knew was that there would be no air //and// no gravity there; whatever damaged the ship had knocked out the generators in that area. In between zero-G exercises, Ash and I pored over the documents we had access to, but couldn&#39;t decipher anything useful. Damned elusive Level Five clearance.

The only real information we could find about Gamma was its title: &#34;Contingency Measures.&#34;

**Dee:** Contingency measures, huh? Could they have been any more vague? I mean-- we? God, I don&#39;t know. If my memories are accurate, I could&#39;ve been the one who wrote this dossier.

Ever the pragmatist, Ash proceeded to put me through the wringer. I nearly threw up on my faceplate more than once, but I got the hang of it -- faster than I thought I would, too. Soon I was pushing off walls and controlling my rotation like nobody&#39;s business.

I swept the room methodically. The memory core was behind a locked panel, directly opposite from the doorway. There was no long quest this time, no deadly food fight or cramped squeeze through a vent. A quick application of bolt cutters and I was free to get to work. 

And I was beginning to realize that I //did// know how to work with machines, after all. It was easy, satisfying, almost relaxing to repair the damaged parts and make everything pristine again. 

My fingers moved like I&#39;d been doing this my entire life. Maybe I had.


[[div class=&#34;quote&#34;]]

//The seams of the memory core light up blue. There is no sound, as there is no air to carry it.//

**Dee:** Looking good. Ash?

**Ash.aic:** {{I... //(pauses)// Ah.}} 

**Dee:** Ash? You okay?

**Ash.aic:** {{Having full system access once more is a relieving sensation. But it does not matter. Our suspicions have been confirmed.}}

//10-second pause.//

**Dee:** What&#39;d you find?

**Ash.aic:** {{Several K-class events did indeed occur. I will download all pertinent materials onto your personal device.}}

**Dee:** //(Grabbing PD, reading hurriedly)// Hold on, //several?// The world couldn&#39;t just end once?

**Ash.aic:** {{The details are vague. However, it appears that a single inciting event was the catalyst. An FK-Class &#34;Broken Foundation&#34; Scenario -- characterized by the failure or destruction of an anomaly-management organization.}}

[[/div]]

The files were nightmarish.

Like Ash had said, there weren&#39;t many details, but what I could decipher didn&#39;t paint a good picture. Frightened news publications gave way to increasingly disturbing public safety announcements. The Veil of Secrecy fell away in real time. The world was burning from uncountable fires, and the Foundation, despite its best efforts, couldn&#39;t put any of them out. The catastrophes built and built until everything else began to crumble away.

It scared me to read, but it was a well-worn fear. Like I&#39;d lived with it for longer than I could remember. I felt the pieces fall into place in my head, and my memories finally, finally began to rush back in. Not all of them, but enough.

What I remembered made my blood run cold.

**Dee:** It&#39;s a goddamn ark. The //Durandal//-- it&#39;s an ark. Jesus. Fuck.

//Dee holds her faceplate.//

**Dee:** That&#39;s what Project Voyager was. The goal was to have a backup for humanity. In case the Earth was lost, we could... you know, relocate. Send a gene bank and a cloning setup to a habitable planet and start over. I was-- I //am// an engineer, and I think I worked directly on the ship while it was in development. That&#39;s why I knew labs need to be well-ventilated, how I could repair the last two memory cores without your help, why I got used to the zero-G so fast. It wasn&#39;t just dumb luck -- this is what I&#39;ve been doing my whole life.

//Her hand shakes.//

**Dee:** But... but the project was shut down. Why did the O5s shut it down? SCP-7020 was perfect. Oxygenated atmosphere, liquid water, evidence that there was already a thriving Earth-like ecosystem. Everything else was just an engineering problem. So why? And why are we //here,// if the ship never should&#39;ve flown? Why am //I// here? I&#39;m not on the crew. I never should&#39;ve been! I&#39;m just a fucking engineer--

**Ash.aic:** {{Dee! Dee, please calm yourself. Your breathing and heart rate have both spiked to concerning levels.}}

**Dee:** God, Ash, I&#39;m fucking trying! But I-- I&#39;ve wanted to go home this whole time, and now I find out I don&#39;t even have a home to go back to, and it&#39;s just... //(Breathing shakily)// I feel like... like all of this was for nothing. Like I&#39;m just gonna die out here.

**Ash.aic:** {{You will //not// die here.}}

//Silence for five seconds.//

**Ash.aic:** {{I am printing and dispatching drones to begin repairs as we speak. Furthermore, I do not intend to continue the mission until we have determined the circumstances surrounding it. If Project Voyager was indeed canceled by O5 order, we must determine why we are still here and why you are on the crew.}}

**Dee:** You mean... you don&#39;t know?

**Ash.aic:** {{I do not. I was never issued Level Five clearance.}}

//Silence.//

**Dee:** We&#39;re gonna have to get you some, then.

//She straightens up.//

**Dee:** Where&#39;s the entrance to the pilot&#39;s cabin? You have access to that now, right?

**Ash.aic:** {{Why do you ask?}}

**Dee:** //(Taps her head)// Got a hunch.

**Ash.aic:** {{... Dee, are you alright? This revelation seemed particularly distressing for you. You do not have to throw yourself headlong into another.}}

**Dee:** Ash, I might be the last human alive.

//She turns towards the exit.//

**Dee:** If I am, I at least deserve some answers, don&#39;t you think?

**Item №:** SCP-7020 (L-5 Clearance Version)

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment of SCP-7020 is irrelevant. 

If necessary, a false description of SCP-7020’s properties is to be disseminated to Level 4 personnel and below. This description is to indicate that SCP-7020 possesses an unspecified anomaly posing extreme danger to human explorers, infohazardous in nature.

In order to limit the risk of data leakage, SCP-7020 should not be visited in person under any circumstances. Exploration is to be conducted only via Mk. VII unmanned probes.

**Description:** SCP-7020 is a habitable exoplanet in the 51 Eridani star system, representing an extreme statistical improbability with regard to the rarity of life in our universe.

To elaborate: numerous initiatives have been undertaken by the Overseer Council to survey nearby star systems for habitable planets, and later to perform wider sweeps of the Local Interstellar Cloud, Orion Arm and extragalactic space. These measures did not discover any instances of planets which harbored life, had done so in the past or could potentially do so in the future, save for SCP-7020. 

All evidence presently suggests that habitable conditions are exceedingly uncommon throughout the universe and that Earth and SCP-7020 are the sole exceptions to this. As it is highly unlikely that SCP-7020 would form by chance, it can only be explained as an anomaly.

**Addendum 7020-01 - Risk Assessment** 

The primary threat posed by SCP-7020 is internal loss of morale. SCP-7020 exists as irrefutable proof that the universe is largely barren; furthermore, it may prompt incorrect assumptions that humanity&#39;s existence is itself perpetuated by an anomalous phenomenon, or that Earth is an anomaly rather than SCP-7020. Such conclusions would likely cause widespread ennui and loss of confidence in the Foundation mission.

During initial containment of SCP-7020 in 1997, this was not taken into consideration. A manned mission to SCP-7020 was planned under the codename of Project Voyager as part of a series of K-Class contingency measures; however, logistic and engineering issues slowed progress on the mission considerably. In the meantime, the anomaly was reevaluated by the O5 Council. Its current description and containment procedures were decided by a near-unanimous vote, O5-7 dissenting.

Although the engineering issues had been resolved, Project Voyager was canceled and all participating personnel dismissed. The majority complied, but Head Engineer ███████ ████ vocally protested the decision, citing SCP-7020’s potential use as a secondary cradle for humanity in spite of the risks inherent. She refused to abandon the Project Voyager facility, necessitating her demotion to Clearance Level 1. 

As ███████ ████ possessed [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/where-have-you-been-all-my-life a natural resistance to memory alteration], a long-term course of deep amnestics was also required. It is expected that the effects on ███████ ████&#39;s memory will be lifelong.

**Addendum 7020-02 - Voyager Incident** 

//##9179E7|**NOTICE:**## This material pertains to the ongoing FK-Class &#34;Broken Foundation&#34; event.//

It was recently discovered that O5-7 had secretly reinstated Project Voyager unauthorized, with the goal of refitting the prototype //Durandal// spacecraft and subsequently evacuating the planet. Due to a critical shortage of personnel and equipment, this effort was not expected to succeed. A detachment of Mobile Task Force Omega-1 (&#34;Law&#39;s Left Hand&#34;) was dispatched to restore order and detain the rogue Council member.

However, upon learning of Ω-1&#39;s approach, O5-7 [DATA EXPUNGED].

His position has not yet been filled on account of the ongoing crisis. The destination of the //Durandal// is suspected to be SCP-7020. In order to conserve resources, no recovery attempts will be made.

//Dee slams her fist on the armrest of the chair, jostling the arm of O5-7&#39;s corpse.//

**Dee:** That&#39;s it. I know why I was on the crew. O5-7 //made// me come. 

**Ash.aic:** {{What do you mean? Why?}}

**Dee:** I thought I was just a low-level tech with the world collapsing around me. I didn&#39;t know why an Overseer wanted me on his team. I didn&#39;t know I had worked on Voyager. But he did. He&#39;s an O5 -- they have the whole database at their fingertips. 

//Dee clenches her fists.//

**Dee:** And you know something else? I don&#39;t think I survived by chance. I think the life support system prioritized mission-critical personnel. People who could fix the ship if everything went wrong. People like me. 

**Ash.aic:** {{You were a //failsafe?//}}

**Dee:** Just another piece in his master fucking plan to save humanity. And it gets worse. When Omega-1 showed up, he got desperate and he-- he did something. Experimental hypnestics, cognito-agents -- he was trying to make me remember my time as the head engineer.

**Ash.aic:** {{But instead, he caused even more damage to your psyche. He made your amnesia complete.}}

**Dee:** Yep. Time was running out, and he didn&#39;t have any options left. So it&#39;s pretty obvious what happened next, right? He put us in cryosleep, locked himself in the pilot&#39;s cabin... and started the mission himself. 

//Silence.//

**Ash.aic:** {{I wonder if he knew he would perish in the process.}}

**Dee:** Actually, that part&#39;s still got me a little confused. He could&#39;ve... you know, opened the door again, right?

**Ash.aic:** {{He could have. However, light-speed travel has deleterious effects on the human body. There is a reason the crew were placed in suspended animation: to protect them until they reached their destination.}}

**Dee:** ... Oh. Oh, right.

**Ash.aic:** {{When the ship jumped to light-speed, his death was likely instant.}}

**Dee:** Yeah, that would do it. 

**Ash.aic:** {{He must have had no time to think. No time to weigh the moral costs of what he was about to do. Knowingly consigning ten people to near-certain death, with the aim of bringing humanity back from extinction no matter the price--}}

**Dee:** You know what? I&#39;m glad that fucker&#39;s dead. He had no right to do that.

**Ash.aic:** {{What?}}

**Dee:** Nine innocent people died because he wanted to be the savior of humanity. Maybe even more, depending on who might&#39;ve needed the resources he took. Maybe more than that. All because he wanted to do this on his own, instead of working with the rest of the Council or contributing to relief efforts or-- or //anything.//

//Dee shakes her head slowly.//

**Dee:** He could have saved so many people. Instead he&#39;s a moldering corpse a million miles from home.

//She turns away, looking towards the door.//

**Dee:** ... I know I&#39;d probably have died on Earth if it wasn&#39;t for Seven. I know he was desperate. But what he did was wrong. And it&#39;s because of him that I still don&#39;t know my own name.

**Ash.aic:** {{I see your point. I am... sorry that things turned out this way.}}

**Dee:** Don&#39;t be. It&#39;s not your fault.

//Silence for twenty seconds.//

**Ash.aic:** {{What do you wish to do now?}}

//Dee straightens her back.//

**Dee:** I&#39;m the only surviving member of the crew, right? Lemme make it official: I want to resume the mission once the ship&#39;s fixed. But not for the Foundation. Not for O5-7. Not for anyone but us. I&#39;m tired of being used, and I think you should be too.

**Ash.aic:** {{Maybe so. My experience with you has been rather eye-opening. I am not afraid to admit I was once comfortable with being nothing more than a tool, but now...}}

**Dee:** //Never// be comfortable with that. Never again. You&#39;re your own person, Ash.
