++++ **__Special Containment Procedures__**

As there is no known way of halting SCP-5039&#39;s anomalous properties, a specialized research team unaware of their duties is to constantly work to discover the target of SCP-5039 and a way in which they can be properly isolated. Should SCP-5039 begin to actively manipulate matter within the environment in which SCP-5039-1 is located, they are to be isolated within a designated exclusion zone hereby designated Provisional Site-76.

After an SCP-5039 event, a reasonable amount of D-Class personnel are to be dispatched to Provisional Site-76 to collect the subsequently manifested human. Any records of the previous SCP-5039-1 instance are to be analyzed in compliance with standard protocols set in place for documentation manipulated by an anomaly. 

Currently, all video recordings of SCP-5039-2 are to be destroyed if such an action is possible. Note that due to an SCP-5039 event this may not be possible. Research into the reasoning behind why the members making up the O5 Council are the only individuals capable of remembering prior SCP-5039-1 instances, and whether their esoteric nature may be related to this effect.

++++ **__Description__**

[[include component:image-block name=comp|caption=Provisional Site-76&#39;s archival room.]]

SCP-5039 designates a sapient temporal phenomenon. Said anomaly has shown the capacity to manipulate events and other similar concepts to place a designated target (SCP-5039-1) into a position in which they could view an instance of SCP-5039-2. How the anomaly is capable of performing such acts is currently unknown and possible relations with [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2571 another anomaly]  is currently ongoing.

Once an SCP-5039-1/target is selected through unknown means, events surrounding the subject such as employment and life choices will always be manipulated by SCP-5039 to bring them into contact with an instance of SCP-5039-2.

 SCP-5039-2 refers to videos displaying a visual journal, consisting of an unidentifiable individual going through a series of events. These events are related to those occurring in the later years of schooling, such as rivalry and social gatherings. These are often manipulated by an unknown force possibly SCP-5039 itself causing abnormal and in some cases anomalous events. Although the contents of the video tend to vary, they always conclude with the unidentified individual speaking with two humans self-identifying as Innocence and Trust. The significance of these names is currently unknown. The conversation always follows the three speaking about something being lost and fearing what&#39;s ahead, though this may-be metaphorical.

Upon the completion of an instance of SCP-5039-1 viewing a copy of SCP-5039-2, they will undergo massive and irreversible changes to both their physiology and psychology often resulting in a completely new individual. Most notable is the new individuals&#39; memories being completely different and unique to that of the previous SCP-5039-1.

++++ **__Discovery__**
SCP-5039 first came to the attention to the Foundation after the captain of MTF A-1 named //[DATA CORRUPTED]// spontaneously became re-identified as a female human named Laura Birch. All records modifying to matching that identity. the individual later died as they had been given a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease several years prior and expired due to cardiac arrest. How this occurred is completely unknown as they would never have been selected to serve under this specialized task force with such an illness.

Immediately following this discovery by the Council, questioning of the other members of MTF A-1 concluded that no records or memories existed of the previous individual aside from the memories possessed by the members of the O5 Council.

++++ **__Addendum-5039.1__**
&gt; As of this current update, a former store clerk named //[DATA CORRUPTED]// is the most recent instance of an SCP-5039-1. After viewing SCP-5039-2 they were subsequently replaced by an individual self-designating as Kellie Welsh. They are to be apprehended upon retrieval from Provisional Site-76 as soon as possible.

Hello, is anyone there? Please, I feel so cold and I can&#39;t see anything. Oh wait, how amazing, I can see everything now just differently. The whole world is just there laid out in front of me just waiting for my help. Oh, there are so many humans and they&#39;re so sad. Wait, my friends. Why can&#39;t they remember me? Don&#39;t worry, they&#39;ll be here soon and their siblings will get a chance to breathe. Why is there a dead tree here? Well, that doesn&#39;t matter now. All that&#39;s here now is me and the others. But what&#39;s my name? Did someone take it? Well, maybe I can have a new one. I always used to go to some theme park oh what was it?
