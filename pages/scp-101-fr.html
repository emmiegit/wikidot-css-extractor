**Title:** SCP-101-FR - Y@u aɹe hëre
**Author:** [[*user DrGemini]]
**Translators:** [[*user macro_au_micro]] and [[*user Lt Flops]]
**Date:** June 29, 2015

**Item #:** SCP-101-FR

**Threat Level:** Red ##red|●##

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-101-FR constitutes a __major breach__ in the Foundation&#39;s coverage. Given that SCP-101-FR is present on the global Internet and its servers (assuming it is hosted on servers) are impossible to locate, Operation &#34;Scarlet Rose&#34; has been initiated.

The details of Operation &#34;Scarlet Rose&#34; are described below.

**Description:** SCP-101-FR is a website with digital mimicry capabilities. SCP-101-FR is considered sentient because of its capacity to react against external intrusion (computer hacking) by sending a highly infectious virus that renders the hacker&#39;s computer unusable, and then evolving its code to close the computer breach used by the hacker.

Its only objective seems to be to reveal the Foundation&#39;s existence to the world. Hence, it should be considered possible that a Group of Interest aware of the Foundation&#39;s existence and seeking to damage it may have created SCP-101-FR.

SCP-101-FR consists of a site accessible on the global Internet at &#34;https://scpwiki.com/&#34;. This site happens to be a near-perfect replica of the Foundation&#39;s current database. No server hosting SCP-101-FR has been located; all attempts at tracing back to the servers have so far resulted in the crash of the computer performing the search or its infection by a computer virus.

No other such site has been found. Only the Foundation appears affected.

SCP-101-FR is capable of maintaining perfect real-time knowledge of the Foundation&#39;s database, even while it is cut off from the civilian Internet and when its servers are protected by a shielding that blocks all wave emissions of any kind. The nature of the connection between the database and SCP-101-FR is unknown; however, it has been demonstrated that:

* When a new document is entered into the database, a new article perfectly identical to that document is instantly posted on SCP-101-FR.
* When a shutdown of the Foundation&#39;s database was declared shortly after the discovery of SCP-101-FR on ████/06/22, SCP-101-FR remained online.

SCP-101-FR seems with time to have developed into other, secondary sites, all of which are copies of the Foundation&#39;s database, based in the countries where the Foundation&#39;s branches are located: Russia (http://scpfoundation.ru/), South Korea (http://ko.scp-wiki.net/), China (Simplified Chinese: https://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/ and Traditional Chinese: http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/), France (http://fondationscp.wikidot.com/), Poland (http://scp-wiki.net.pl/), Spain (http://scp-es.com/), Germany (http://scp-wiki.de/), Thailand (http://scp-th.wikidot.com/), Italy (http://fondazionescp.wikidot.com/), Japan (http://ja.scp-wiki.net/), Ukraine (http://scp-ukrainian.wikidot.com/), Portugal (http://scp-pt-br.wikidot.com/), the Czech Republic (http://scp-cs.wikidot.com/), and Vietnam (http://scp-vn.wikidot.com/). This manoeuvre seems to be aimed at best propagating the Foundation&#39;s existence by translating it into as many languages as possible, thus reaching as many audiences as possible.

Even worse: in the same manner as for access to the general public, access restrictions for certain documents, normally reserved for personnel of Level 3, 4, or higher, have been broken. SCP-101-FR also appears capable by some unknown process of rendering memetic security agents completely ineffective. Thus, SCP-001 (to take just one example) is displayed for all to see. Fortunately, the addition of false files coupled with &#34;Scarlet Rose&#34; will maintain relative security against any revelation to the general public.

&#34;Scarlet Rose&#34; is an operation to undermine credibility on a large scale. It has several objectives:

**I/Undermining the credibility of SCPs:** Pass off SCP-101-FR as a site for creepypastas (urban horror stories), consisting of dummy reports written by amateur Internet users for entertainment purposes.

**II/Undermining the credibility of the writing:** Pass off SCP-101-FR as a community site where anyone can register to participate. Internet users will be invited to apply: naturally, the application will be automatically rejected by a bot. To ensure that the illusion of being able to participate is not broken, fake members must be added or deleted regularly, to imitate real social exchanges. These fake members can if necessary be simulated by Type HSS-3 basic artificial intelligences, to interact on forums or social media.

NOTE: Paradoxically, the existence of SCP-101-FR coupled with Operation &#34;Scarlet Rose&#34; could prove beneficial for the Foundation&#39;s coverage. Indeed, the Foundation&#39;s position on the Internet as an &#34;entertainment site&#34; automatically discredits any evidence or witness of the Foundation&#39;s real activities.

Anyone discovering the truth about the Foundation and declaring it via the Internet would be immediately mocked, accused of confusing reality with fiction, or considered paranoid and/or gullible. **This should in no way hinder research aimed at putting an end to the existence of SCP-101-FR.**

+ [[size 75%]]Hacking SCP-101-FR:[[/size]]

It is technically possible to hack SCP-101-FR and make changes to it, but this should be strictly regulated so that SCP-101-FR has no opportunity to react:

&gt; * In the case of the deletion of a passage, document, or the totality of the site&#39;s contents, SCP-101-FR will react with hostility. SCP-101-FR will infect the hacker&#39;s computer with an extremely virulent virus of unknown type, after which it will restore the deleted content and rearrange its coding so as to remove the computer flaws previously used for hacking.
&gt; 
&gt; * In the case of the addition of content, or even the grafting of certain computer modules (used, for example, to imitate a &#34;wiki&#34; site), SCP-101-FR will allow it to happen as long as the data stolen from the Foundation is still clearly visible and accessible to the general public. If the content is too cumbersome, then SCP-101-FR will remove __//all//__ the additions made beforehand along with the computer breaches exploited during the hacking.
&gt; 
&gt; * In the case of a data exchange (e.g., the replacement of a few words with others), SCP-101-FR seems not to notice anything. This allows the falsification of certain essential details, such as names and dates. If the falsification is too obvious (e.g., an entire modified passage), then SCP-101-FR will remove __//all//__ the data exchanges made beforehand along with the computer breaches exploited during the hacking.
&gt; 
&gt; //Remember that every inaccurate quantification when making a change nullifies all the work accomplished beforehand, and makes future hacking a little more complicated. - O5-█//

+ [[size 75%]]List of resources used in Operation &#34;Scarlet Rose&#34;:[[/size]]

* Eight &#34;Little Sister&#34; observation teams, each consisting of three monitoring agents rotated every 6 hours and located in multiple Foundation sites around the world, are constantly monitoring SCP-101-FR and its evolution. Any standard changes (the addition of new documents, changes in ratings, etc.) must be duly noted, and any unusual changes (e.g., the potential manifestation of awareness in SCP-101-FR) must be immediately reported to O5-█.

* Eight &#34;Global Warning&#34; observation teams, each consisting of three monitoring agents rotated every 6 hours and located in multiple Foundation sites around the world, are monitoring references made to SCP-101-FR on social media, forums, and other sites. Monitoring the popularity of &#34;SCP Foundation&#34; sites is necessary at all times. The production of &#34;fanart&#34; (artistic representations of SCPs, Foundation facilities, or agents, regardless of the medium) must be regulated; any fanart that comes too close to reality must be removed under the pretext of copyright. Any demonstration of an Internet user making a connection between SCP documents and real facts must be immediately reported to O5-█.

* One &#34;Broken Code&#34; hacking team, consisting of between five and 12 elite hackers located at the Foundation&#39;s Computer Research and Operations Centre in ██████ █████, █████████, is responsible for studying the behaviour of SCP-101-FR, gauging its responsiveness to external hacking, and finding any existing flaws in its digital coding before transmitting them to the &#34;Puppet Master&#34; hacking team.

* One &#34;Puppet Master&#34; hacking team, consisting of between five and 12 elite hackers located at the Foundation&#39;s Computer Research and Operations Centre in ██████ █████, █████████, is responsible for using the computer flaws discovered by &#34;Broken Code&#34; to make minimal changes to the contents of SCP-101-FR. These changes include:

&gt; * Modifying the names, locations, and dates mentioned to prevent any cross-referencing with real facts by the civilian public.
&gt; * Imitating a &#34;wiki&#34; site to give the illusion of coming into contact with a real community sharing site run by civilians.
&gt; * Simulating fake civilian members with Type HSS-2 or HSS-3 basic artificial intelligences (Human Simulation Software of Realism 4 can be used in case of significant doubts expressed by the public).
&gt; * Adding small inconsistent or unrealistic elements to the documents to make everything less credible.

**NO FILES SHOULD BE DELETED EXCEPT FOR THIS ONE.**
In fact, this file reveals precisely the details of Operation &#34;Scarlet Rose&#34; and the immense trickery surrounding SCP-101-FR. Being read by the general public would risk destroying all our efforts and jeopardising the Foundation&#39;s coverage.
