In 1911, the newly-formed Foundation tried to fight off a rampant god in an attempt to stop the Fae Empire from reemerging only to end up causing the most unforgivable crime it has or ever would commit during its time. Mass murder of those it meant to protect, caused by greed and stupidity.

Despite trying to make amends, in 1985, the Foundation launched a military operation focused on capturing a dangerous criminal hiding within the Free Port of Esterberg, one of the few places outside their touch. Though well intended, due to yet another string of misunderstandings and corrupt leadership, the operation ended in catastrophe, with over a 1/5th of the city destroyed. The haven previously acting as the hub for most anomalous activity within central Europe was now scarred as it had never been, with its almost-rebuilt trust for the Jailors shattered once more.

Years later, the wounds from the incident and the Foundation&#39;s past crimes still ache. Even with Site-120&#39;s peculiar modus operandi, the divide between the two groups is still widening, and the Foundation seems to get more and more out of touch with reality with every passing day. With ancient magic, primordial gods, and shadow cabals lurking in every corner of the world following the fall of the Fae Empire and the Great Diasporas, the conflict is near a critical point of no return. There seems to only be one way to fix this -- change of ways through adaptation to the world turning around it.

In the light of new day, the Foundation needs to try its best to fix the wrongs committed so many times -- and to do so, it&#39;ll need help. The scars will never heal for good, but with the cooperation of several Groups of Interest and the citizens of Esterberg, there&#39;s still a chance to avoid the point of no return. As the world greets a new day and new way of thinking once more, so will the Foundation, adapting to whatever it may have in store.

Now, let&#39;s try to fix the divide for good, but this time, let&#39;s try together, shall we?

So, you just opened this hub for the first time and are very confused as to how to read this / have no idea what the below article listing means. Let me explain.

First thing&#39;s first -- the articles in the below div are a comprehensive list of all articles tagged with from-120s-archives and considered part of the wider canon. They are sorted in the chronological order their action happens, as divided into major eras that define the world of the canon at the time. The &#34;contextual materials&#34; collapsibles refer to articles not written explicitly for the canon, but heavily referenced by it, as important to each respective era.

As you can notice, some of the articles below contain markers next to them. Here&#39;s what each of them means:
* //[untranslated]// marks articles that are part of the canon, but are still yet to be translated to English.
* //[non-canon]// marks articles that heavily reference elements within the canon but heavily contradict others down the line. They are still considered part of the canon, just not its main storyline (the one that lacks any markers and forms a fully cohesive narrative that is the main arc for the canon), and should be considered alternate &#34;what if?&#34; universes.
* //[semi-canon]// marks articles that heavily reference elements within the canon and are referenced by other, fully canon articles, but contradict other, usually not major elements within the canon. They are still considered part of the canon&#39;s main storyline minus the contradictory parts.

So, with all this in mind, you might ask -- //how the hell am I supposed to read this//?

From 120&#39;s Archives is formed in such a way that most articles within it stand on its own, albeit might be slightly confusing without some prior context. So, to make sure this doesn&#39;t happen to you, I&#39;d recommend the following reading order:
* **1.** [[[Ralliston&#39;s Proposal]]]
* **2.** [[[SCP-5292]]]
* **3.** The [[[and-every-time-we-meet-again-hub|And Every Time We Meet Again]]] storyline
* **4.** [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-120|Secure Facility Dossier: Site-120]]]

Those four should provide you with a very good ground to stand on that allows you to understand the grand majority of what happens in other F120A articles. So, after familiarizing yourself with them, you should be more than prepared to read the rest in any order you find fitting!

[[tab What Is This Canon About?]]

-----
[[=]]
++ Canon Overview
[[/=]]
-----
There are //a lot// of ways to describe what F120A is actually about. &#34;The modern-fantasy canon.&#34; &#34;That canon about Fae and Children of the Night.&#34; &#34;The canon in which the Foundation is trying to be good.&#34; &#34;The canon about Site-120.&#34; And, in a sense, all of them are right. If I had to describe it with one sentence, though, it would be this: &#34;An attempt to create a main canon (not //the// main canon; just a very large canon that encompasses a lot of elements and other canons, series, characters, and articles) in which the Foundation realizes it must adapt its ways to the often-changing world of magic around itself, and it must either change, or become obsolete.&#34;

For years, &#34;morally gray&#34; was the dominant mindset of the Foundation -- but with discoveries of the world&#39;s true nature, this had to change.

With Esterberg&#39;s accidental destruction and the Third Great Diaspora before it, the SCP Foundation realized it can&#39;t stay that way for much longer -- the anomalous world is near a critical point of no return, where the only option will be an all-out war on all-fronts-anomalous. And it&#39;s certain the hateful gods of the Fae Empire would like to use this potential conflict to bring Earth under their dominion once more. To avoid the worst possible scenario, the Foundation has to change its approach towards the anomalous.

With the help of the oddball Site-120, other Groups of Interest, and the people of Esterberg themselves, the Foundation //must// try to better itself. It will take a long time, but only time and cooperation can heal these scars. It can no longer afford to be just a prison, containing the numerous horrors leftover by the dissolving of the Fae Empire millennia ago, because an uncotrolled outbreak would destroy reality as we know it.

This canon is about that -- the Foundation coming to terms with its ways being outdated in the modern world. It&#39;s about the Foundation trying to better itself through cooperation, magic, and acceptance. It&#39;s about the anomalous coming to terms with accepting reality and working towards making itself fit within our ever-changing society. It&#39;s about the anomalous affecting our world and said world changing around us. It&#39;s about the people the Foundation employs realizing they don&#39;t have to stay silent, and making a change. It&#39;s about these people having their own lives worth living. It&#39;s about magic, horrible gods, ancient wars, and the past that the Three Diasporas were not being dealt with just yet. And it&#39;s about the Foundation finally realizing it&#39;s been wrong for a long, long time.

[[=]]
++ Site-120
[[/=]]
-----

Site-120 is the most important part of the Foundation&#39;s plan to change -- as one of few Sites actively encouraging the usage of the anomalous and the main observation center for Esterberg, it&#39;s where most of the action happens. Seemingly in the center of all of this, Site-120 has almost no time to breathe -- there&#39;s always something on the horizon -- one more place to explore, one more life to save, and one more anomaly to study.

Most importantly though, Site-120 is magical -- metaphorically and literally. With a majority of its personnel either using magic or being anomalous themselves, life in it never seems to be normal. But even then, its people try -- living their own lives worth describing, meeting each other on a regular basis, trying to make sense of the chaotic world around themselves. They try, because they know that they are the only thing stopping all-out pandemonium, they try, because they need to, but most importantly, they try, because they deeply care about the anomalous that surrounds them.

Site-120 is much different than other Foundation Sites -- it&#39;s not cold. It cares for its people and it acts as their home. It doesn&#39;t stand by idly as bad things happen, because it can&#39;t stand seeing people it cares for hurt.

For more in-depth information regarding Site-120, refer to [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-120|its dossier]]].

++ **Esterberg**
[[/=]]
-----

Imagine that one magical and crowded as hell market you visited when you were a kid. Even if there were so many people there, it was filled with magic, and you wanted to be there, because it somehow felt exciting, almost, exciting due to its magic. Apply that logic to a large city located in a pocket dimension, filled with hundreds of years of the untold history of the anomalous -- and you&#39;ve got Esterberg.

Esterberg is, first and foremost, a city. A [[[nexus-series|Free Port]]], to be exact. Just like Site-120, even if the bigger picture still exists, it&#39;s at its very core filled with humans. Well, not exactly. Housing humans, [[[SCP-1000|Children of the Night]]], Fae, and whichever anomalous races hide themselves in its pocket dimension, Esterberg is also about the people in it. They live their lives in one of its many districts, doing their jobs whilst finally being able to express their anomalies without the world judging them for it.

The most important part of Esterberg is the fact it&#39;s magical. No, really. It&#39;s a weird fantasy-like city that is meant to inspire wonder, as the safe space for everything weird contrasting the gray realities of Poland. When everything around it is bleak, even normal people aware of the anomalous seem to want to live there -- be it anartists, activists, thaumaturgists or just regular normal humans wanting to be a part of this fantasy too.

For more in-depth information regarding Esterberg, refer to [[[SCP-5373]]].

++ **The Outside World &amp; the Multiverse**
[[/=]]
-----

Naturally, the world doesn&#39;t only revolve around Site-120 and Esterberg. Somewhere out there, the scattered ruins of the horrible Fae Empire lay, hidden throughout the world to most, but still active, binding its time until its leader may return. The outside world of F120A mainly focuses on the interactions of previously known locations with the ancient horrors of the Great Diasporas and Esterberg&#39;s fall, the fallout of the events, and the people it wronged.

Beyond baseline reality, however, the Multiversal Compass lies. A collection of all realities to ever exist, it accounts for all possible outcomes whenever a choice gets made, splitting the world into two separate timelines. The further away from a universe a reality is, the harder it is to get to it, and the more it differs. Theoretically, somewhere out there, a world where everything has gone perfectly exists. But so does a world where everything went horribly wrong. With a near infinity of possibilities, the only limit is your technology and sanity. The Foundation did not dare to enter this multiverse of chaos in search for a better future. Not yet, at least.

For more in-depth information regarding the Multiversal Compass, refer to [[[SCP-6172]]].

**[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-asheworth#pages Dr. Daniel Asheworth] / The Black King:** One of the five directors of Site-120 and the Site&#39;s resident thaumaturgic talent, heavily involved in the [[[and-every-time-we-meet-again-hub|Damien Nowak case]]] and his cult. Loves magic almost as much as he hates actually being on-site and doing what he&#39;s supposed to. One of the few people whose bodies accept youth-prolonging magic. Despise his actual age, rather childish. Hot-heated, short-tempered, and sometimes arrogant, but with a good heart.

**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-rivera#pages Dr. Jessie Rivera]:** Member of Site-120&#39;s Director Council, Class IV reality-bender, and Asheworth&#39;s best friend. Actually takes responsibility for her actions, acting as the much more grounded in reality of the two. Granddaughter of [[[SCP-5292|Hannah Rivera]]], the person responsible for Site-120&#39;s establishment. Married to Magdaleine Cornwell.

**Damien Nowak / PoI-5936 / Nobody, Iteration-φ / The Hunter:** Leader of &#34;the Children,&#34; a cult specializing in worshiping an entity associated with creation known as &#34;Father.&#34; Attempting to bring Fae, Humans, and Children of the Night to live again in harmony by giving humanity&#39;s stolen terrains back to the numerous races they&#39;ve wronged. Utilizing horrible ways to do so, believes the ways justify the means. [[[SCP-5672|Murdered by Daniel Asheworth]]] on 22/05/1985 for everything horrible he&#39;d done to him and his closest friends. [[[the-beast-that-shouted-i-at-the-end-of-the-world|Resurrected by SCP-5572]]], later [[[the-lands-nobody-returns-from|becoming Nobody]]] following the legion&#39;s entry into Esterberg. The most efficient hunter of Triumviraté scum to have ever walked the earth, waging a holy hunt against the beast that Mab is.

**Queen Mab / SCP-001-C / PoI-001-C:** The long-dead queen of the long-gone Fae empire, manipulating history from beyond the grave. Personally responsible for the Day of the Flowers and the Great Factory Purge genocides. Among the most powerful reality benders and thaumaturges to have ever walked the earth -- even dead, she can cause massive turns in human history. The only remaining part of her is her heart containing her soul, buried underneath Site-01. Insane, cruel, and evil to her core. Shadow leader of Triumviraté, orchestrating her inevitable return to reality from the lands beyond life.

**O5-9:** The result of Natalie Asheworth mixing with the soul of the antithesis of Father, the destructive entity called the Beast. Made her way into the position of Overseer by years of lies only to attempt to gain the power of the diety she&#39;s supposed to fight. [[[the-beast-that-shouted-i-at-the-end-of-the-world|Died on 10/09/1985]]] by coming into contact with the dimension both deities originated from, finally let go by Asheworth as the fading memory she was. Her position on the O5 Council would stay vacant forever.

**Agent Marie Surratt:** Resident errand agent -- was everywhere, did everything. If there&#39;s a case or a mission, you bet she&#39;s involved. Though technically declared dead on 24/07/2003 due to an unspecified interaction with [[[SCP-4000]]] entities, later found to be re-animated by [[[SCP-5572]]] to fight in its never-ending war. Following her battalion&#39;s victory over the forces of hell, declared the new leader of the Legion. Found her and her legion a place within Esterberg as a major player in its criminal world following their reemergence into the aboveground. Turned unapologetically insane by the hell she escaped, waging a war again Triumviraté and its terror.

**Cptn. Jeremy Cornwell:** Brother of one of the five Site Directors, Magdaleine Cornwell. Not the brightest, but has a passion for his friends and what he does. Calm most of the time, but when he snaps, it&#39;s not pretty. Chief of Site-120&#39;s Security and commander of local MTF units. Huge military nerd; when asked, he can talk for hours.

**The Keeper / SCP-5292-2:** The ghostly bookkeeper of [[[SCP-5292]]]. Said to be the brother of the Biblical Noah. Believed to not be related at all, with the conception and stories just being born out of human belief. Though harsh to people he doesn&#39;t know, kind to those with a passion for books. Loves literature of any kind.

**Ra.aic:** Site-120&#39;s main [[[aiad-homescreen|.aic]]]. Calm and calculative, always knows the answer to most problems. Specializes in information about deities. Named after the co-founder of the Site, Raia Micheals.

**James Micheals:** Among the Foundation&#39;s best ontokinetics researchers and brightest researchers in general; personally responsible for discovering many ground-breaking discoveries in his field of science. Socially awkward and often stuttering, he is an extremely useful asset in Site-120&#39;s Director Council.

**Alistair Vemhoff:** The oldest non-O5 person in the Foundation, clocking in at over 140 years by 2020. The only person on-site aside from Asheworth with a body accepting prolonging youth. Leader of Site-120&#39;s Translation Team, fluent in over 40 languages. Extremely knowledgeable and calm. [[[in-life-as-in-language|Seen more than he probably lets everyone know]]].

**Dr. Ethan MacCarthy Junior:** A broken man coming from a family long-serving Site-120. With [[[SCP-5936|his father, the previous Site Director]]], and his younger brother dead, he&#39;s deeply bottled within himself. Knows a lot about theology and religion, with a Ph.D. in the latter. Turns his bottled emotions into work only he would be able to pull off. Dead by [[[SCP-6072|09/12/2035]]].

**Dr. Magdaleine Cornwell:** Harsh, assholish, and always on time. The most competent person in all of Site-120, and also one of its five Directors. Sister to its security chief. Cares a lot about her work and will always try to be as fair with the rules and schedules as she can. Not evil, just deeply unlikable to most. Married to Jessie Rivera.

**Mieczysław Bury:** Not the brightest, but honest, hard-working, and a deeply good person. Lead of Site-120&#39;s maintenance team. Loves his work and deeply cares for the people around him.

**Triumviraté / GoI-120:** Fae for &#34;we will prevail,&#34; also known as GoI-120. Fae environmental terrorist group mainly operating from Esterberg&#39;s shadows, focused on retaking the terrains stolen by humanity. Wishes to re-establish the world-encompassing monarchy their race once had by fully resurrecting its old queen, Mab. Crazy monarchist genocidal maniacs. Created in 1911, following the Great Factory Purge. Will stop at nothing to achieve their goals. Hate the Foundation -- and by extension, Site-120 -- with a burning passion.

**Bone Battalion / Claire&#39;s Legion:** A group of individuals revived by [[[SCP-5572]]], escaped from 5572-PRIME to Esterberg following their victory in their eternal war. Led by Marie Surratt, an ex-Foundation agent, and revived Beethoven, both fallen victim to the anomaly. A major criminal organization within FP-120, waging an all-out war on Triumviraté and its terror. Though unapologetically insane, with good albeit questionable intentions.

**[[[o4-s-summit|O4 Command / O4 Council:]]]** A gathering of Site Directors, Department Leaders, and important personnel. Responsible for handling important situations that do not require the attention of Overwatch Command. Devoid of a distinct leader, instead lead by one of its members chosen specifically to be knowledgable and trustworthy on the topic of the summit. In light of the nonexistence of the O5-9 position following the conclusion of the Damien Nowak case, O4 Command works as a tiebreaker in situations where an O5 Council vote needs one, with its vote being that of the majority of personnel attending the summit.

**[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/obearwatch#pages Obearwatch Command:]** A mysterious council of unknown entities apparently protecting humanity, but not fully understanding how it works. Always uses bears to do so. With a goal and way of operation as mysterious and unspecified as themselves, it&#39;s carefully monitored by the Foundation, appearing to pose no threat. With good intentions, apparently possesses a [[[SCP-5464|protective bear entity]]] within every country. Logistics of either unknown.

**ZM &#34;Witch Slayer&#34; Division:** Poland&#39;s black ops dealing with the anomalous. Brutally competent, utilizes all force available to achieve its goals. Formed by the Soviet Union during its control over the country for the purpose of all [[[scp-5890|shady operations involving the anomalous and maintaining control]]], it backfired horribly when ZM&#39;s command initiated a coup and gained independence following the end of the [[[pickman-blank-proposal|Panopticon Crisis]]] and fall of the Union. In modern day, it acts as the organ by which the Polish Government deals with the Foundation and all anomalous criminals outside of Nexuses and Esterberg, bringing them to justice in their shadow courts beyond the law.

-----

**[UNKNOWN]** -- consensus baseline reality achieves stability as the result of numerous religious faiths being simultaneously true due to human belief bestowing power upon them. &#34;Old Gods&#34; and numerous other deific entities presumably responsible for the creation and destruction of the era fade away, leaving Earth to its own machinations -- no further outside influence on history from these entities is noted from this point forth.

**300 000 years BCE** -- humans, Fae, and Children of the Night emerge as the three dominant species on the planet, evolving from one common evolutionary predecessor. As humans live in the plains during the day, the Fae hide in the forests where nature reigns; the remaining Nightwalkers thrive in the darkness of the caves.

**280 000 years BCE** -- Queen Mab and her sister (mostly referred to as &#34;the Inventor&#34; or &#34;the Factory&#34; due to her name being later stolen) are born. Utilizing their nigh-limitless ontokinetic and thaumaturgic abilities, they establish a vast empire, connecting all Fae as one nation ruled by the two. Children of the Night create numerous underground cities, and humans remain as nomadic tribes.

**275 000 years BCE** -- as the two queens&#39; control over their abilities grows to near full understanding, the Fae empire expands worldwide, taking control over both humans and Nightwalkers. The former are put into gigantic habitats, unaware of their situation and observed by Fae royalty as entertainment, whilst the latter&#39;s cities are destroyed and their inhabitants sent to the darkness of the mines to work as slaves. The divide between the Fae poor and the aristocrats grows exponentially as the royalty gains power through the exploitation of the working class, treated similarly to the prisoners.

**240 000 years BCE** -- an all-out war between the two factions of the Fae empire breaks out, with Queen Mab and her sister standing on opposite sides, divided by moral issues. Utilizing her vastly greater power of ontokinetic abilities and the skill to take away Names, Mab swings the conflict in favor of the Fae royalty. Exploiting the chaos, Children of the Night break free, uniting with humanity and eventually bringing the conflict to the end by raiding the palaces of the royalty. Mab murders her sister, but temporarily loses her power in the process, allowing for the rebellion to eliminate her. The Fae empire falls, with its subjects scattering around the globe. Children of the Night become the dominant species, ending the First Great Diaspora.

**220 000 years BCE** -- the Nightwalkers create vast, technologically advanced metropolises, coexisting harmoniously with nature. Humanity once again becomes a protected, zoo-like species. Through unknown means, Queen Mab survives between several afterlives, eventually gaining insight into baseline reality.

**210 000 years BCE** -- Queen Mab persuades humanity to overthrow the Children of the Night, lending them some of her remaining power. Together with the remaining Fae, humanity and its newfound allies destroy the SCP-1000 civilization, eventually wiping their memories of the event. The Second Great Diaspora, also referred to as the Day of the Flowers, makes humanity the dominant species. The remaining Fae scatter across the globe, maintaining an extremely low population, hiding in the forests to not allow Mab to gain further control.

**13th Century** -- Due to the wars on the anomalous -- especially Fae -- of medieval times during the Fourth Occult War caused by an [http://scp-pl.wikidot.com/scp-pl-259 attempted resurgence of the Fae Empire], Esterberg is established by the Children of the Night and Fae.

**1870** -- The SCP Foundation is founded by the groups previously known as the General Assembly of Thaumaturgists and Theologists Against Queen Mab, following the discovery the entity is still alive due to research obtained by the conclusion of the Sixth Occult War.

**1908** -- Dr. Shanahan R&#39;yann of Prometheus Laboratories creates and distributes a [[[wniosek-o-dotacje-na-opracowanie-srodka-przeciwko-alergii|theoretical way to relieve Fae of the iron allergy plaguing large parts of the species]]].

**1911** -- [[[ralliston-s-proposal|The Great factory Purge]]] -- also known as the Third Great Diaspora -- results in the slaughter of most of the remaining Fae. A later split in the remaining faction reads to the creation of Triumviraté, formed by the part of the remaining non-4000 Fae wishing to resurrect their long-gone empire and resurrect Queen Mab.

**1914** -- In an attempt to fix the sins of the Third Diaspora, the Foundation establishes their long-time atonement plan, Directive Alpha/1911. [[[historia-polskiego-projektu-przechowawczego|The Polish Containment Project]]] is formed shortly after as a result.

**13/01/1916** -- [[[SCP-5292]]] (at that time known as PL-X0R38/0124) and Esterberg get discovered.

**02/05/1916** -- Following a raid of Triumviraté on SCP-5292 and Dr. Hannah Rivera&#39;s murder by [http://scp-pl.wikidot.com/propozycja-arcydziegiel SCP-PL-001-ACG], and Site-120 is founded.

**1939-1945** -- World War II and the Seventh Occult War cast the world into an age of fear. As the [[[obskuracorps-memos|Obskurakorps plan to initiate the Rite of Solomon Ritual and bind thaumaturgy to their will]]] fails, the conflicts eventually come to an end.

**30/08/1949** -- [http://scp-pl.wikidot.com/scp-pl-259 SCP-PL-259], a long-dead descendant of Queen Mab, is resurrected by Triumviraté members, attempting to bring back the Fae Empire. The Third Fae Empire, as it comes to be called, raids numerous areas in Asia, before being neutralized in a giant battle by the combined forces of the Foundation and the Global Occult Coalition.

++ Contributor&#39;s Guide
[[/=]]
-----
From 120&#39;s Archives is a rather loose canon, so there&#39;s no really one good way to go about writing for it. There are a couple of things you&#39;ll want to remember while doing so, though.

* **The setting:** as discussed in the second tab, the main settings of this canon are Site-120, Esterberg, and Fae Empire-associated areas -- however, it doesn&#39;t necessarily stop there. If you find a way to make the outside world still work in the confines of this canon, then by all means don&#39;t be afraid to write about it.

* **The tone:** there&#39;s isn&#39;t one set tone for most of the canon -- it can be [[[the-furmen|scary]]], it can be [[[SCP-5464|silly]]], |it can be [[[SCP-5484|funny]]], it can be [[[a-library-empty|personal]]], it can be [[[and-every-time-we-meet-again-hub|action-packed]]], it can be [[[SCP-5572|absurd]]], it can be [[[ralliston-s-proposal|grand]]]; as long as it somehow features the setting, you can go into approaching it however you want to.

* **Major themes:** Though the canon doesn&#39;t only follow one central narrative, there are a couple of major themes you&#39;d want to follow when writing for it.
 * Magic is everpresent: magic is an important part of the lives of many people living within the setting -- be it the people of Esterberg, Site-120 itself, or the entire world around it. Wherever one goes, magic will inevitably follow.
 * History heavily affects the modern day: whether we like it or not, what once happened has heavy consequences on modern society, and we must deal with that fallout, unless we want history to repeat itself.
 * Belief is key: the world is weird. Filled with hundreds of gods and world-creation stories, there isn&#39;t exactly one answer to what happened in the old days. That happens only because the belief of sentient creatures is what forms these stories and entities -- it&#39;s the vision of a god that shapes it, and it is us that give it power.
 * Cooperation is necessary: the Foundation may try by itself, but it will never achieve true peace and redemption without working with others -- so, logically speaking, it must do so. In this canon, the Foundation actively attempts to cooperate with other GoIs, PoIs, and everything in-between, often changing their policies and approaches.
 * The Foundation is still made of people: even if the Foundation may seem like one body, it is, at its very core, still made out of people. People that live their own lives and people that form bonds -- just because they work in one Site, doesn&#39;t mean everyone in it is the same -- and you shouldn&#39;t be afraid to explore these interactions.
 * The world changes: even if the Foundation doesn&#39;t want that, the world never stays in one place, always changing and evolving past what the organization considers the status quo.

* **A few rules:** These are pretty much the only rules on contributing you should follow when writing for the canon.
 * Try to get a good feeling of what the canon is about before you start drafting: you don&#39;t have to read //everything//, but the knowledge of how Site-120 and Esterberg work is good to have.
 * Don&#39;t break other people&#39;s stuff: try to make your contributions be, you know, contributions, building upon established elements, rather than only make another person&#39;s entry worse. Ideally, if you want to mess with other people&#39;s toys, ask them first.
 * Try to remain canonical: of course, nobody&#39;s going to force you if you want to break some canonical element for the purpose of your story, but try to avoid that -- half the fun of writing for this canon is the fact you can cross over with other articles and mention their elements, meaningfully bringing the world together better. Speaking of which,
 * Don&#39;t be afraid to cross over: this canon is built upon the different parts of Site-120, Esterberg, and the outside world interact with each other -- you&#39;ll notice that almost all works in this canon //somehow// mention or crosslink another article. It&#39;s not required, but mentioning other lore elements and whatnot is kindly welcomed and makes the world feel better together, so try to make your story meaningfully feel like a part of this world.
 * D-class don&#39;t exist within Site-120: they just don&#39;t. So, if you&#39;re going to write for this, don&#39;t use them.
 * Add to the hub: when you&#39;re done writing, don&#39;t be afraid to add your story to the appropriate section of the hub.
 * Feel free to poke [[*user Ralliston]] with your ideas and drafts -- he doesn&#39;t have anything better to do anyways, and he&#39;d love to hear and read whatever you came up with.

++++ **FAQ**
[[/=]]
-----

+++ Are other canons canonical towards this one?

Yes -- a lot, actually! Here&#39;s the exact details of that:

* [[[aiad-homescreen|AIAD]]], [[[on-guard-43-hub|On Guard 43]]], and [[[the-s-c-plastics-hub|S &amp; C Plastics]]] are hard-canon. Almost everything that happens in them is canonical towards this -- the only real difference is what happens following [[[SCP-6500]]], because OG43 and S&amp;CP happen in the Threshold timeline, whilst this canon happens in the Vanguard timeline; due to this [[[no-return-hub|No Return]]] -- and by extension the Impasse -- is also hard canon to 120.

*  [[[the-alchemy-department-hub|The Foundation Alchemy Department]]], [[[antarctic-exchange-hub|Antarctic Exchange]]], [[[the-coldest-war-hub|The Coldest War]]], [[[the-gulf|The Gulf]]], [[[the-man-who-wasnt-there-hub|The Man Who Wasn&#39;t There]]], [[[Resurrection]]], and [[[those-twisted-pines-hub|Those Twisted Pines]]] are also softly conneted to F120A. Additionally, this canon borrows heavily from [[[third-law-hub|Third Law]]]&#39;s vision of the Seventh Occult War. However, they are __not canon to each other in any other way__; the only thing connecting them is a rough vision of what transpired during the war.

* The author shamefully admits to not having read a lot of [[[dread-circuses-hub|Dread &amp; Circuses]]], [[[etdp-hub-page|Et Tam Deum Pativi]]], and [[[wonder-world|What a Wonderful World]]], but from what he&#39;s heard, it seems that most of their lore works nicely with 120.

* Due to [[[cool-war-2-hub|Cool War 2]]]&#39;s nature, there isn&#39;t exactly a verdict on its canonicity -- as long as it doesn&#39;t break canon, it&#39;s considered canonical.

* Everything else is in a state of limbo -- if you can make it work without breaking canon (or //with// breaking canon on purpose), then by all means please go ahead.

+++ Does this canon have a centralized CSS Theme?

It kinda does! It&#39;s not really a full-on canon theme, but it&#39;s a clean version of [[[theme:blankstyle|Blankstyle]]] that I sometimes use on my articles set in the canon, with the absolutely amazing logo in the header and the actual code created by [[*user Azamo]] ([https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/azamo authorpage]).

**DISCLAIMER:** This is a Blankstyle theme (linked above). To properly use it, you have to first include that theme so that the below code will work. Additionally, the theme also uses the [[[component:fade-in|Fade In]]] component which you can also include if you wish for the full effect.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Code&#34; hide=&#34;- Code&#34;]]

Aside from that, we also have [[*user EstrellaYoshte]]&#39;s ([[[desk-of-junior-designer-s-yvonne|artpage]]]) standard Site-120 logo and [[*user Machen2]]&#39;s ([[[machen2|authorpage]]]) Site-120 above-ACS header -- which both make an appearance in a bunch of headers of articles set in this canon. Here&#39;s the code for them:

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Code&#34; hide=&#34;- Code&#34;]]

The Sigma version:

[[code]]
[[module CSS]]
div#header h1 a span {
    font-size: 0px;
}
div#header h1 a:before {
    content: &#34;Site-120&#34;;
    color: #eee;
    
}
div#header h2 span {
    font-size:0px;
    padding: 4px;
}
div#header h2:after {
    content: &#34;Fighting Fire With Fire&#34;;
    font-weight: bold;
    color: #f0f0c0;
    padding: 19px 0;
    text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, .8);
    white-space: pre;
}
#header {
  background-image: url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/inadvertent-neolinguistics/Ontotop.png)
}
[[/module]]
[[/code]]


The [[[theme:black-highlighter-theme|BHL]]] version:

[[code]]
[[module CSS]]
:root {
    --logo-image: url(&#34;https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/secure-facility-dossier-site-120/ontologonew.png&#34;);
    --header-title: &#34;Site-120&#34;;
    --header-subtitle: &#34;Fighting Fire With Fire&#34;;
}
[[/module]]
[[/code]]

The [[[theme:basalt|BASALT]]] version:

[[code]]
[[module css]]
:root {
    --logo: url(&#34;https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/secure-facility-dossier-site-120/ontologonew2.png&#34;);
    --title: &#34;Site-120&#34;;
    --subtitle: &#34;Fighting Fire With Fire&#34;;
}
:root {
    --sidelogo: url(&#34;https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/secure-facility-dossier-site-120/ontologonew.png&#34;);
    --sidesubtitle: &#34;Fighting Fire With Fire&#34;;
