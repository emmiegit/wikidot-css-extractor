You notice a very large cardboard box next to the door. Written on the front, in black marker, are the words &#34;Cwazzy&#39;s Box.&#34; &#34;What&#39;s Inside?&#34; you wonder.

You look around, then take it back to your office. You cut open the lid and open the flaps, then peer inside...

------

It&#39;s a slightly smaller box! How curious. You remove the smaller cardboard box from the packaging. There is nothing written on this box.

------

It&#39;s a very, very, very small box, covered in purple felt, like a jewelry case. Maybe there&#39;s precious gems inside! &#34;This could be worth a fortune!&#34; you think to yourself.

You carefully pop open the lid, and find within..

------

A crumpled sheet of paper. It&#39;s been crushed into a ball and jammed into the case. You are disappointed and very confused.

You unfurl the ball and read the writing on the inside. It&#39;s written in black marker and is very crude. 

It reads as follows:


[[=]]
[[size 150%]] **CWAZZYS SUPER DUPER EPICSAUCE AUTHOR PAGE!!!!!!!1111 =DD** [[/size]]
[[/=]]

HIIIIII! I&#39;m cwazzycwafter, and I like to write things! 

I&#39;m a very cool guy, we should be friends (=

I wrote some things btw!! You can read them if you like!

Skips:

[[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5696 | &#34;SCP-5696 - One Last Ace.&#34;]]] - A cool story set in the 30&#39;s, amidst prohibition. Chill with the mobs of Chicago and play a few rounds of cards!

[[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6606 | &#34;SCP-6606 - Spectrum Says&#34;]]] - A neat little format screw about the end of society via bureaucratic takeover! Paper for the paper gods!

[[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6610 | &#34;SCP-6610 - Dial-Up Drama.&#34;]]] - You fools! I&#39;ve created a new major GoI right under your noses! Haha! (note: not yet actually a &#34;major&#34; GoI. Anyone interested in doing some writing for them?)

Tales:

[[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/shades-and-polo-act-one-the-show-is-about-to-begin | &#34;Shades and Polo - Act 1 - The Show is About to Begin&#34;]]] - The very start of an ongoing series of tales about a couple of dudes caught in the crossfire between our foundation, and a couple of new GoIs. Give it a read!

[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/shadesandpolo2 | &#34;Shades and Polo - Act 2 - Making Ghosts&#34;]]] - Here&#39;s part 2! Our heroes are stuck in a 70&#39;s time loop! What will they do?

I don&#39;t have anything else yet! Thank u for reading! kthxbai!!!

------

&#34;This is... very bad.&#34; you think to yourself, turning the sheet over. You set it to the side and look at the case in disappointment. You notice something caught inside it, where a ring would otherwise sit. It&#39;s a small slip of paper, neatly folded and tucked into the interior.

You remove it and unfold it, then read the inside..

------

&#34;God, this is a terrible author page. I could never submit this. I should get someone else to handle my files.. Maybe break some site rules in the process..&#34;
