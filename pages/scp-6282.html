+++++ Special Containment Procedures
[[/=]]

------

SCP-6282 is currently held in a 10 x 10 m containment cell augmented with tantalum carbide (TaC) coating, which is capable of withstanding temperatures of nearly 4000°C. Every wall of the cell, as well as the speakers and cameras that have been installed in it, are covered in approximately 6 cm of this coating. In the case that a Winter Dance Party event does significant damage to the cell, maintenance staff are to enter and make repairs as soon as the event has concluded.

Foundation web crawlers are to consistently scan the internet for news concerning the deaths of published musicians. Any report of the drug-related death of a musician, regardless of its likely accuracy, is to be immediately reported to Dr. Gabriela Velasquez, the current head of research into SCP-6282. 

Dr. Velasquez or any other researchers observing SCP-6282 are to use the speakers in SCP-6282’s cell to broadcast the music of any artist whose possible death is reported to them. This music should be played until all instances of SCP-6282-1 disappear.

+++++ Description
[[/=]]

------

SCP-6282 is a collective designation for a number of objects formerly owned by Kurt Waller, a Deer College alumna and independent musician who was last seen on 10/24/1971.

SCP-6282 consists of the following objects:
* One (1) phonograph record of Waller’s first album, //February Made Me Shiver//
* One (1) picture of Waller and his sister, Victoria Waller, in a 20 x 20 cm frame
* One (1) lighter, showing significant signs of wear, presumably from extensive use
* Two (2) packs of twenty (20) Maverick cigarettes. Both are opened and empty
* Three (3) bottles of Courvoiser Napoleon brandy. Two are empty, one is unopened
* One (1) 1965 Fender Duo-Sonic electric guitar, in pristine condition

SCP-6282 displays a number of anomalous properties. For one, the aforementioned objects are perpetually consumed by blue flames, which are visually consistent with flames created by the burning of alcohol (C2H5OH) and copper chloride (CuCl2). However, these flames are significantly cooler than typical blue flames, which burn at a minimum of 3000°C. The flames covering SCP-6282 continuously burn at 1967°C, but do not seem to damage the objects. Despite extensive testing, no method of extinguishing the flames has been discovered. 

Any drug-induced death of a published musician has the capacity to trigger a Winter Dance Party event. Research has determined that these events always occur less than seventy-two hours after the death of the musician.

During a Winter Dance Party event, an entity emerges from SCP-6282. This entity, designated SCP-6282-1, resembles Kurt Waller, and is composed of the same inextinguishable blue flames that cover SCP-6282. The entity will stand inert for approximately eight minutes and thirty-two seconds.

If music from the recently deceased artist is not played within this timeframe, SCP-6282-1 will begin to multiply and grow in temperature. Instances of SCP-6282-1 have been recorded to reach temperatures of approximately 3800°C. For a period of four minutes and eleven seconds, instances of SCP-6282 will attempt to spread out, seemingly to cover as much area as possible as they continue to multiply. Once four minutes and eleven seconds has elapsed, the instances will begin to violently explode.

+++++ Addendum 6282.1 (Investigation into Waller&#39;s Time at Deer College)
[[/=]]

------

After extensive prodding from the Foundation, Deer College agreed to share details on Kurt Waller’s academic record. On 3/4/1972, the college revealed that Waller had been a student from 1963-1968, majoring in Anart and minoring in Ritual Studies. 

Furthermore, Deer College also revealed that Waller’s sister, Victoria Waller, attended the school from 1965-1967, but passed away on 2/3/1967, before being able to earn her own Anart degree with a minor in Music.

+++++ Addendum 6282.2 (Interviews with Waller&#39;s Parents)
[[/=]]

------

Following the Foundation’s discussions with Deer College, interviews were conducted with each of Waller’s parents, ██████ and █████ Waller. These interviews revealed that Kurt and Victoria Waller both struggled with mental health problems from a young age, and that these problems followed them into their adult lives. 

According to Waller’s mother, the loss of his sister was particularly difficult for him, and they heard from him less and less frequently after Victoria’s death. The last time either of Waller’s parents noted that they had any contact with him was approximately 8/1/1971, more than two months before his disappearance.
