**Interrogation with SCP-7799-3** 
 
Four days after the incident, the top priority regarding SCP-7799 was to finish the interrogation with SCP-7799-3, with Vladivostok and Calabasas acting as witnesses/interrogators. Despite Vladivostok&#39;s poor mental state at the time, he agreed to complete the interview in return for a short 3-day weekend. Calabasas felt obligated to engage in the interrogation as well. 
  
The following is the interrogation between SCP-7799-3, Calabasas, and Vladivostok. 
 
[[div class=&#34;addendum&#34;]] 
 
[BEGIN LOG] 
 
[Calabasas and Vladivostok sit at the opposite end of a foldable table, with folders full of photos and data including a television set behind them to show SCP-7799-3 clips from the exploration. Calabasas and Vladivostok have refused to speak to each other since meeting, and only intensely stare at the other with either malice or disapproval.] 
 
[SCP-7799-3 is escorted in by armed guards. It is wearing several casts around its body due to its injuries during the incident. It is manually seated down opposite to Calabasas and Vladivostok. The armed guards leave to give the three their privacy.] 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Are you going to attack me like a feral cat again? 
 
**Vladivostok:** Shut the fuck up. What&#39;s your name? 
 
**Calabasas:** Vlad, there&#39;s no need for such vulgar language in- 
 
**Vladivostok:** You be quiet too. SCP-7799-3, what&#39;s your name? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** I don&#39;t know. 
 
**Vladivostok:** Very funny. There&#39;s no point lying anymore. It&#39;s over. All of it. 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** I&#39;m not. 
 
**Vladivostok:** I don&#39;t like your tone. 
 
[SCP-7799-3 is silent for a moment.] 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Are we done here? 
 
**Vladivostok:** What are you talking about? Also, you don&#39;t get to speak unless asked to! 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** I&#39;m getting this over as soon as possible, doctor. 
  
**Vladivostok:** Well, you&#39;re going to be here for a while so cut it out. There won&#39;t be another Dues Ex Machina for you this time. 
  
[SCP-7799-3 is silent, and looks around the room.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** Now, what is your name? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Administrator X of the X Insurgency. 
 
**Vladivostok:** I&#39;m going to call you &#34;X&#34; instead. Alright, first question-  
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Hold on, doctor. I have a question.
 
**Vladivostok:** [Groan] What is it? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Why do I have to tell you this? Do you guarantee my freedom if I tell you everything? 
 
[Vladivostok is silent.]
 
**Vladivostok:** I... can&#39;t confirm it. 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Then why should I tell you anything? 
 
[Vladivostok appears infuriated.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** Listen, X. You could Cooperate with us and we&#39;ll be done. Or, you could keep your mouth shut, and we&#39;ll just ok you in a dark cell for the rest of your miserable life. Got it? 
 
[SCP-7799-3 looks at Vladivostok. It fiddles with a pen on the table before speaking again.] 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** What do you want to know? 
 
**Vladivostok:** Cal, give me the folder. 
 
**Calabasas:** You get it yourself- 
 
[Vadivostok rudely grabs the folder out of Calabasas&#39; hands and lays out its contents in front of SCP-7799-3.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** First question: How did SCP-7799 come into existence? Did it just materialize? Or was it built manually? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** [Continues to fiddle with the pen before placing back on the table.] A bit of both. 
 
**Vladivostok:** What do you mean by that? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** If you want to understand, I&#39;ll have to tell you a story. 
 
**Vladivostok:** Is it relevant to what we&#39;re talking about? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Yes. 
 
**Vladivostok:** Then tell me. 
 
[SCP-7799-3 looks at the ceiling with its round head, still scratched and dented from Vladivostok&#39;s outburst four days ago.] 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** 1981. Vienna College. Me and Valentine were- 
 
**Vladivostok:** Wait a minute, who&#39;s Constantine? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** A tyrant. A Machiavellian, specially. 
  
**Vladivostok:** What? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** To be more specific, he&#39;s the type of man to see many things and think about how they&#39;ll be useful to him- 
 
**Vladivostok:** I&#39;m not dealing with this shit right now. 
 
[Vladivostok pulls out a photo of SCP-7799-1 from their exploration in SCP-7799 and shows it to SCP-7799-3.] 
   
**Vladivostok:** Is this the guy? 
 
[SCP-7799-3 closely examines the photo.] 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Yes. That&#39;s Valentine. 
 
**Vladivostok:** Full name? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Valentine Constantine. 
 
**Vladivostok:** Let me get that down... there. Now continue this &#34;story&#34;. 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Okay. As I said. It was 1981, me and Valentine were top of our class in engineering. I mean, &#34;top of our class&#34; was an understatement. We were the best in the nation of Austria. We could make anything you could think of. Robots, knockoff pong machines, all those sorts of trifles. 
 
I was a young man. A somewhat looked down upon minority amongst my Hungarian Eastern Orthodox parents and other religious peers, being a proud atheist. But I knew what they couldn&#39;t accept, so that didn&#39;t bother me too much. I knew that once I made it big, they would bow to my feet, kissing my shoes and weeping over their doubt in me and all the time they spent judging me for my rationality. This career was important to me. 
 
Valentine was an eccentric man. He would dress funny and talk funny for no apparent reason other than &#34;he liked to&#34; according to his parents. He would dance and sing to disco, like any other man at the time while trying his best at flirtatious affairs that would go horribly wrong. Even through all of that, he used to be... my friend. 
  
We were not only friends but partners in science. We would build all sorts of useless knick-knacks and doo-dads that would be forgotten in a day. Perhaps we just had blissful ignorance of the world like everyone else at the time and didn&#39;t think outside of our personal bubbles. It was the 80s, after all. 
  
**Vladivostok:** Are you getting to the point yet? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Yes, I am. As I was saying: We made temporary creations, ones that would be forgotten by everyone after a day. But after some time, we wanted to do something bigger than that. We wanted to be kings, not just some funky inventors in Europe. We were going to become gods.  
 
From the beginning, we knew it was an ambitious creation. One that would create any if not all things in the known universe. One that could make us kings of the world that once laughed at us. The Big Red Bouncy Ball was the name we came up for it, and I couldn&#39;t think of anything better than that. 
  
**Vladivostok:** Big red bouncy ball? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** //The// big red bouncy ball. After we graduated in 1981, we moved to a nice flat near Vienna that may or may not have been fraudulently gained, but that&#39;s not important. We went straight to work. After several blueprint drafts and saving up for supplies we started to make the frame, then the exterior, then the interior where the real work would begin. 
 
I don&#39;t remember how long it took us to make it. Somewhere between six-seven years, it&#39;s all hazy in my mind. But I do remember those sleepless nights slaving over a blueprint or turning wrenches and hammering hammers onto a prototype that wouldn&#39;t work. Either it would spontaneously combust or fall apart. Not to mention that afterward, me and Valentine would have our iconic argument after the failure of the machine, arguing over who caused it. 
 
I remember those vicious arguments, too. It showed a lot of his affection for... Niccolo Machiavelli&#39;s philosophies. Every time he would convince me that it was my fault and I //believed// him. I genuinely did. I should have seen it in him a long time ago but I never thought about it. He wasn&#39;t capable of such a mindset, was he? Now I know that he was. 
   
We finished the machine. It did whatever we wanted, as hoped. We created all sorts of... unique monstrosities that would have any kind of mindset we wanted them to. One of Valentine&#39;s inquiries piqued my own interest too when he suggested the concept of re-imagining the world&#39;s architecture to be more efficient than before. Effectively, make the world the way we wanted to. But when it was framed in that way instead, more selfish ideas arose.
 
A society consisting of whatever people we wanted, whatever societal standards or axioms that we preferred. We could make a whole new world. Imagine for a moment... creating Neo-Great Flood that could wipe out this shithole society and create a new one that was according to our standards. We would become gods, and not like the ones that were forgotten in time like Shamash or Marduk. We would be everlasting. 
  
**Vladivostok:** You planned on destroying the world and making a new one? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** To put it plainly, yes. That was our initial goal. However, that would not be able to come to fruition once me and Valentine would enter one last intricacy. One that would define the current situation at hand and maybe this universe as a whole if you&#39;re willing to think about it. 
   
What would this society look like? We both had drastically differing visions for this new world. 
  
My personal vision consisted of a rational world that would skip the painful eras of the ancient and antique world as a whole. Or at least, however long the span of &#34;ancient&#34; or &#34;antique&#34; is to you, but in this case, I knew. A better world in which those in need are helped up by those above until everyone was on the same plane, same standing as each other. A socialist utopia consisting of a rational race of intelligent beings. 
 
**Vladivostok:** What is this rational super race? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** People like me of course. This society would have only a brief phase of human evolution before a utopia was achieved. We wouldn&#39;t have to wait like communists who waited and worked endlessly for a socialist state utopia that would never happen in their lifetime or any other lifetimes. A race of people who would believe in rationalism and science instead of the superstitions that this society calls &#34;religious beliefs&#34;. 
  
Religion has hampered our way of thinking for thousands of years. We could have had this society that I just described to you if it wasn&#39;t for its existence. All undesired concepts wouldn&#39;t exist or even be considered for a second by anyone if it wasn&#39;t for it. 
   
**Vladivostok:** So your plan was to destroy religion? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** In a gross oversimplification, yes. It is the root of all problems in our society today. If these religious people could die out, then we would be ushered in a new golden age. This is why I&#39;m a proud social Darwinist. If we can burn down the churches, mosques, synagogues, Buddhist and Hindu temples, and everyone who attends them, we&#39;ll be better off. 
  
**Vladivostok:** Interesting prejudiced philosophy you got there. Too bad it&#39;s all bullshit. 
  
**SCP-7799-3:** Prejudicing against my beliefs, doctor? 
 
**Vladivostok:** Just tell me what happens next. 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** I&#39;m getting there. Valentine&#39;s version of a perfect world was different than mine, obviously. It would have been one where his religious practices, Roman Catholicism, would have been an axiom of existence itself, and he would be at the center of it on God&#39;s lap, ready to throw lightning with him at any man who so dares to even think about forsaking the Lord.
 
As you could tell, I wasn&#39;t necessarily fond of this idea. Nor was he fond of mine. We were passively aware of each other&#39;s beliefs, but never truly wanted to confront or talk about it. This time, we had to. 
  
So what did I do? I took half of our creation for myself and left the rest for him. 
  
**Vladivostok:** You //physically// took half of it? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Correct. The machine would have been drastically limited for both of us and unable to create a whole new world, but it was enough power so that we could separate and engage in our own personal endeavors.
 
 While things didn&#39;t go to plan afterward, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Our friendship was already dwindling after realizing that only one of our societies could come to fruition, and I thought he would get the message. But little did I realize that Valentine wasn&#39;t that type of man. 
 
You see, during our time working on the machine, he would rant about the mighty empires of the past and how things were better during that time. He was also quite fascinated with different ideologies that he would adopt for himself. 
 
**Vladivostok:** What exactly were these ideologies? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** He liked anything that didn&#39;t involve communism, unlike me. But there was one specific concept he adored the most out of the rest. Christofascism, to be exact.
 
**Vladivostok:** Cristofascism? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** You know, American fascism. You see, Valentine wasn&#39;t exactly a fascist fan, either. Not Hitler&#39;s version of it, Mosley&#39;s, or even classical fascism from Mussolini himself piqued his interest, and he had even criticized it on several occasions. But something about Cristofascism he clicked with. Perhaps because it lined up with his vision of what the world should be. Although a Machiavellian himself would not have been fully committed to the ideology itself, but would rather twist and contort it into something that benefits him. 
  
So when I took the machine for myself and ran away to Budapest in my home country, it was foolish of me to think that would have been it. When he came to my neighborhood with an entire army of camera-headed machine men, I thought I was dead. Then, I decided that maybe I should fight fire with fire, so I created my own army of super-race individuals, otherwise known as me, and fought back. The war had begun.
 
We were fighting for so long in many different places until Valentine decided to dig in at Langtry and create a makeshift version of a new society, separated from the current one that is at work. As expected, I fought back by creating an insurgency with the least amount of strength that my half of the machine could muster, and from there I think your organization has properly documented what has happened since.
 
So that is my story. No need to play Baba O&#39;Riley or anything like it after that. There&#39;s nothing to be fascinated or blown away by. It&#39;s the story of how my life and my plans for the world were ruined by the elite institutions we call religion, the //sole// reason all of this happened. 
 
[Vladivostok writes down the last bit of information SCP-7799-3 gave him, and he sighs.]  
 
**Calabasas:** What an... inspiring story you&#39;ve got there.
  
**Vladivostok:** Okay... so, let me get this straight. You and SCP-7799-1 made something called the big red bouncy ball, that could have created or ended civilization as we know it, and you didn&#39;t know what to do with it because you both had prejudiced and bigoted visions for what you should do with it... thereby, causing a full-scale conflict in the middle of the Texan desert? Where your friend creates a 1980s revival of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and a cult of personality while you kill the humans it created for made-up political gain in a desert warzone? 
  
**SCP-7799-3:** That... is the nearsighted and simple way of seeing things, doctor. 
 
**Vladivostok:** [Sigh] What a useless reason for all of //this//. //This//! [He points to the photographs of chaos within SCP-7799 and photos of dead bodies within the desert. He even goes to the lengths of playing a video of the team&#39;s suffering within SCP-7799 and videos of the impoverished communities within Czernowitz.] 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** What is this supposed to tell me? 
 
**Vladivostok:** You don&#39;t understand, do you? You and your friend here have created a society of civilians virtually no different from us that suffer every day under the tyranny of your former best friend and the cruel actions of your insurgency.
  
**SCP-7799-3:** All of these photos and videos you&#39;ve shown me don&#39;t mean anything to me. These are just names, dates, pictures, and other trifles that are beneath me. While I can validate the legitimacy of these statistics and findings your team made, I don&#39;t necessarily feel anything towards it. Can its interview be over now? 
  
**Vladivostok:** You don&#39;t care, do you? You&#39;re a fucking piece of shit. You&#39;ve detached yourself from humanity so much to the point where you asked me if the interview is over yet! I have one last question and that&#39;s it. I want to end this little talk as soon as possible. You and this Valentine are the reason why the world&#39;s such an awful place. 
 
[SCP-7799-3 may have chuckled after Vladivostok&#39;s declaration.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** Where&#39;s this big red bouncy ball? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** It&#39;s in Eastern Vienna in a short, blue house. If it&#39;s boarded up that&#39;s probably the place. 
  
[Vladivostok writes down the location and specifics about it.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** There. The interview&#39;s over. Are you happy now? 
 
[Vladivosok pushes the buzzer to let the guards back in to bring SCP-7799-3 back to its cell.] 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Very much. You will rue the day you all captured me. I will return to the battlefield one way or another, and there&#39;s nothing you can do to stop me from cleansing the world of ignorance and barbarianism. [Sigh] Nothing makes sense. Whenever I try and help the world, they prejudice against me for it. They just don&#39;t understand. Catheters spit out impurities at an ideal efficiency... bacteria spreads swifter in confined spaces... and war&#39;s definitive ratification of superiority against another... but none of //you// make a lick of sense. 
 
[SCP-7799-3 is escorted out of the room as its words echo through Vladivostok&#39;s head. Calabasas and he clean up their documents, statistics, and photos.] 
 
[END LOG]

**Addenda** 
 
Shortly after this interrogation, Operation Perseus and all that had to be done afterward were complete. SCP-7799-3 was moved into average humanoid containment in Site-228 located in Hungary to avoid similar incidents in the future. The other half o
 
Dr. Bimstion and Dr. Pen were recognized for their combined efforts in the research and containment of SCP-7799 and were given similar opportunities regarding different anomalies. Sergeant Lancaster was given an honorary funeral alongside those who lost their lives in the Site-88 incident, which at this time served as a dominant topic of gossip amongst Foundation personnel for several months. 
 
Dr. Vladivostok and Calabasas were given praise for their efforts alongside disciplinary charges for their unorthodox and inappropriate behavior during this time frame. Below are each respective disciplinary charge and the results of them. 
  
[[div style=&#34;color: black; border: solid 2px #000000; background:#f2f2c2 url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat; padding:15px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align:center;&#34;]]
 
**Disciplinary Records** 
 
**Doctor Roger Calabasas** 
 
Due to Dr. Calabasas&#39; abusive and overly authoritative attitude towards the members of Perseus and specifically Vladivostok, who appeared to serve as an emotional vent for Calabasas&#39; insecurities, he would be demoted to level three clearance and asked to not be head of any further research projects of importance.

[[div style=&#34;color: black; border: solid 2px #000000; background:#f2f2c2 url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat; padding:15px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align:center;&#34;]]
 
**Disciplinary Records**  
 
**Doctor Gergo Vladivostok** 
 
Dr. Vladivostok was charged with unprofessionalism and lack of composure during instances of intensity or peril, which counts towards his behavior in SCP-7799 due to him personally signing up for the exploration in the first place. He would be demoted to level two clearance, with an opportunity to regain his previous clearance after a set period of time, and would not be blacklisted from any further promotions.
 
[[/div]]
   
Around the premises of SCP-7799, multiple military checkpoints and research outposts would be constantly set up around the anomaly, removing the possibility of any further military attacks from SCP-7799. The underground tunnels constructed by SCP-7799-2 instances in order to exit SCP-7799 were subsequentially demolished. However, the question soon arose regarding how these tunnels came to be. 
 
The construction company assumed to be making these tunnels in Langtry, Texas appears to not exist and seemed to serve as a front for SCP-7799-2 instances who were constructing these secret tunnels. How this was accomplished is unknown. 
 
SCP-7799&#39;s presence is still a viable threat. Multiple Foundation personnel have allegedly seen SCP-7799-2 instances observing them going to and from work. These instances were reportedly dressed in black suits and holding briefcases. Upon being followed, they would disappear in crowds or around corners. 
 
Another example was a recent incident taking place at the SCP-7799 Research and Containment Headquarters in which Dr. Pen had been missing for three days. After this three-day period, an unmarked Delorean drove through HQ&#39;s front entrance and crashed into the reception desk. When armed guards approached the vehicle, Dr. Pen rolled out of the passenger&#39;s seat and onto the ground. There was no driver other than a concrete slab placed on the acceleration pedal. 

Pen himself had various burn marks and lashes across his body, including half of his hair ripped off implying some form of torture was placed upon him. A paper note super-glued to his bare chest read the following: 
  
[[div class=&#34;nobody&#34;]]
 
You Babylonian Englishmen think you have won but that is not true I am Kaiser Valentine Constantine and I never sleep I never die my presence is all around I am an omnipotent force that will be there when you are buried
 
Your culture and society will be erased alongside your warehouse business that you think is cool but isn&#39;t I will destroy every single one of you until there is nothing but a crater where you once stood filled with statues of me that read: KAISER VALENTINE CONSTANTINE HAS VANQUISHED HIS ENEMIES AND DONE THE LORD A FAVOR AMEN you are destined for death
 
And for my old friend and arch enemy Administrator X you will not hide from me I will find a way to you and end this once and for all even if it is the last thing I do you will be destroyed and brought to hell by me You could have had everything with me if you were still my loyal friend I could have been Austria and you would have been Hungary we could have controlled both kingdoms together as friends and ruled the world but you did not 
 
I will have my revenge soon and everyone will feel it no matter where they are they will not escape from it they will
 
[[/div]]
 
The rest of the note descended into indiscernible scribbles with droplets of spit scattered around them. 
  
The destructive capabilities of SCP-7799 are now comfortably understood, and other Foundation action outside of its containment procedures has been deemed unnecessary, as SCP-7799 is believed to collapse on its own once SCP-7799-1&#39;s half of SCP-7799-A has ceased function. Until then, it is recommended to exercise extreme caution when dealing with the anomaly and to be aware of its presence on the Foundation.

**Vladivostok:** Good luck with that. Goodbye, Cal. I&#39;ll see you another time maybe. 
 
[Vladivostok hangs up and sighs to himself. He looks around his office, feeling emotionally drained. He thinks about Operation Perseus and everything that happened. He thinks about Calabasas, and their interactions together. He thinks about Lancaster, and if there was anything he could have done to stop his death.] 
 
[There&#39;s even a moment in which he thinks if his life would have been better if Operation Perseus never happened.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** None of it makes sense... none of it. 
   
[Vladivostok says this to himself before resuming work at his computer, hoping to convince himself that it was all a dream due to the sheer ineffability of it all. However, it was not.]
