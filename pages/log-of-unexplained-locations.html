&gt; **Foreword:** This page is to be devoted to the documentation of low threat anomalous locations which have been discovered by the SCP Foundation over the years. Although all locations listed in this document warrant securing and cover-up measures, none of them are closely enough tied to an underlying anomalous cause or considered a high enough containment or research priority to warrant full Special Containment Procedure documentation. This list may be used as a resource should knowledge of these locations become useful or necessary in the future.

[[# 601616]]**Unexplained Location UE-601616**
**Description** An unnamed island (0.44 km²) in the Baltic Sea completely devoid of animal life. Land animals introduced to the island gradually lose survival impetus and typically die of dehydration within days. On initial containment, human subjects developed a flat affect within 15 minutes of exposure and became unresponsive to stimuli within two hours. A single subject eventually recovered when removed within 16 hours, although 50% of subjects failed to recover after 4.25 hours exposure (and expired without medical life support). This effect has decreased over time and as of 2018, these thresholds are estimated to have nearly doubled since initial testing.
**Date of Containment:** 1944-05-08
**Location:** 54°57&#39; N 15°32&#39; E

**Unexplained Location UE-868992**
**Description** An area measuring roughly 10 m x 20 m x 17 m in which the effects of gravity are reversed. Entering the area causes an object to &#34;fall&#34; upwards until exiting the area 17 m above. However, since this would typically cause the subject to fall downwards, most objects become trapped in a cycle of exiting and reentering the space until managing to force their way towards the edges.
**Date of Containment:** 1999-09-17
**Location:** Iquique, Iquique Province, Chile
**Security Protocol:** A warehouse has been built around the location. At least two guards are to monitor it at all times.

**Security Protocol:** The park was purchased by the Foundation and labeled “The Black Hole” as under construction. Anybody who attempts or successfully enters “The Black Hole” are to be administered Class A amnestics and escorted out of the park.

**Unexplained Location UE-542256**
**Description** A &#34;Haunted Manor&#34; theme park ride inhabited and operated by entities that claim to be ghosts. Entities are non-hostile and only wish to scare and entertain. Entities will attempt to keep their sentience a secret voluntarily.
**Date of Containment:** 1967-03-12 (Public access granted 1969-08-09)
**Location:** Buena Vista Lake, FL, USA
**Security Protocol:** Due to high public knowledge of the building&#39;s existence, but not of the anomalous property, and financial backing and investment of the █████ corporation, the building must be under constant watch, and a stock of Class B amnestics be kept on site should secrecy be lost, and cover story A-13298, &#34;False Rumor&#34;, be spread. The site should be condemned and demolished afterward.

**Unexplained Location UE-928135**

**Unexplained Location UE-700560**
**Description** UE-700560-A and UE-700560-B are two areas of land within a 1km distance of each other wherein satellite imaging shows the presence of two non-existent structures, one of which has never existed (a large mansion in a secluded pasture, UE-700560-B), and one of which formerly existed, but has been demolished (an abandoned house located on a nearby side street, UE-700560-A). The latter, formerly existing structure was at one time an anomalous structure, however the structure inexplicably lost its anomalous properties in 2010 and was demolished the following year. Satellite surveillance shows minimal activity occurring at either location, but personnel on the ground report seeing neither the structures, nor subjects coming or going from these areas.
**Date of Containment:** ████-██-██
**Location:** Walkertown, NC, USA.
**Security Protocol:** The pasture land designated UE-700560-B has been purchased by the Foundation and is currently used as a surveillance outpost to monitor activity at either site, itself designated Site-B. Due to the secluded location of both sites and low likelihood of civilians being affected by the anomaly, no action against residents living in the area is authorized.

**Unexplained Location UE-561348**
**Description** A collective designation for any &#34;Jamba Juice&#34; brand beverage chain operating inside the nation of Indonesia.

**Unexplained Location UE-55984**
**Description:** A cave in the small village of ██████, France with various cave paintings dating back as far as 2.3 million years. Among the drawings one would expect, several interpretations of figures in lab coats and jumpsuits standard to SCP Foundation personnel are present along with several crude depictions of the SCP Foundation logo.
**Date of Containment:** 1997-03-03
**Location:** ██████, France
**Security Protocol:** Due to the location presenting no danger aside from a small information breach, security is minimal. The parts of the cave containing the SCP related drawings are walled off to the public under the guise of being unstable. They are accessible to study given approval by one staff member of level-2 clearance or above. The remaining area of the cave is now operating as a tourist site &#34;Special Cavern of Paris&#34; as a low-maintenance form of income. Any members of the public caught trying to infiltrate the roped off areas of the cave are to be taken into custody, questioned, and then released after given appropriate amnestics.

**Unexplained Location UE-55112**
**Description:** A small area of land at Montauk, New York was accidentally discovered on February 19 by Dr. █████ █. Hawley in which all photos taken depict a massive amount of compression, despite being roughly the same file size as a high quality image. Any photos taken within an area of around 50 square meters will display varying degrees of compression, ranging from 50 to 4 pixels per centimeter (ppcm). Additionally, the photos taken will not compress any organic matter captured in the image, resulting in an effect similar to focusing a camera on a single position. The affected area seems to shift every few hours, but stays within a one kilometer diameter circle. 
**Date of Containment:** 2021-02-19
**Location:** New York, United States
**Security Protocol:** The area of land affected should be tested daily using Rettru Mini hidden Spy Cameras, positioned around the radius of land described previously. Access will be cut off via a cover story that sharks infest the waters around the land and that quicksand covers the entire beach; care should be taken to ensure no individuals wander into the anomalous zone, and even greater care not to release any media taken of the area. Any individuals who may appear are to be monitored to ascertain whether they are of any degree suspicious of the region and/or if they take any form of media away from the area. Should any media be taken of the region, the individual and any accomplices may be taken into custody, where the captured images and video will be deleted permanently via use of █████.█████.exe at Site-█.

**Unexplained Location UE-196224**
**Description:** Island containing what appears to be a relatively small modern town, complete with signs of current habitation.  Little information is available, as any attempts to actually reach the island result in the island appearing to move away from the observer, remaining at roughly the same distance regardless of speed.  This occurs regardless of the method of travel used and will also affect air traffic.  Testing revealed that the anomalous nature of the island will also affect skydivers.  If multiple people attempt to reach the island simultaneously, all of them will experience the same effect.
**Location:** South Pacific Ocean
**Security Protocol:** As the island gets very little traffic and is effectively self-containing, security is nearly non-existent.  Those experiencing the anomaly generally believe themselves to be hallucinating, often from exhaustion.  This is facilitated by a misinformation campaign denying the existence of an unreachable island.

**Unexplained Location UE-237179**
**Description:** Small, locally-owned thrift store.  Contents are completely normal and display no anomalous properties.  However, every item for sale was either lost or sold by Jane Edwards, a certified public accountant from Portland, OR.  Worthy of note is that Jane Edwards has never visited the store or even the city in which it can be found.  Items arrive at the store through a series of unlikely yet apparently coincidental events.
**Location:** Galway, Ireland
**Security Protocol:** Foundation personnel installed as employees of the store.  Original owners and employees placed under Foundation surveillance.  As the provenance of the items cannot be easily discovered by the public, no further security protocols are necessary at this time.

**Unexplained Location UE-234872**
