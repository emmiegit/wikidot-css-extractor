**Discovered By:** Field Agents Charles, Field Agent James

&gt; **Name Given:** Doctor Luna Ludenberg
&gt; **Description:** Female human of European descent, dressed in a white lab coat, a pair of black boots, a pair of black goggles, black pleated dress pants, a pair of leather gloves, and a pin of the pride flag for transgender people. Subject spoke fluent English, but had trouble speaking at points. Subject repeatedly claims to be a living example of the &#34;mad scientist&#34; archetype, but is noted as being socially anxious and apologizing often.
&gt; **Common items sold:**
&gt; * Multiple pairs of bulletproof opera gloves. Subject produced gloves by removing leather gloves, revealing indefinite layers of removable opera gloves. Subject then produces a six-shooter revolver hidden under the table and fires at removed gloves to show their abilities. Subject then proceeds to offer &#34;potential buyer&#34; to put them on to &#34;test out&#34; the gloves. Multiple instances have been bought for Foundation use. 
&gt; * Multiple DVDs, CDs, cassettes, VHS tapes and vinyl records of media that either includes the involvement of subject or purport to be public domain. These include media known to be in the public domain, such as //Night Of The Living Dead,// and media still under copyright, such as Spike Jone&#39;s first album and //It&#39;s a Wonderful Life.//
&gt; * A mechanical drone, with &#34;A Really Good Argument&#34; engraved on both sides. When activated, device began to float via conventional means. Drone then proceeded to cover itself in a black smoke that stays attached to make the appearance of a minute storm cloud. Machine then began flashing purple electricity in a manner similar to a thunderstorm. A stray purple &#34;lightning bolt&#34; then hit FA Charles, rendering him stunned. Subject reassured FA James that the &#34;lightning&#34; was non-lethal. FA Charles then proceeded to leave the SCP-2444 event to tell any civilians about the Foundation and the existence of anomalous phenomenon. Anyone not directly involved in the SCP-2444 event were amnesticized, including FA Charles.
&gt;  
&gt;  //I would like to point out that, after this incident, I&#39;ve been keeping tabs on Charles in his civilian life. He seems to have become politically active as an anarchist. This is... strange to me, considering he voted for Trump last election. I have a feeling this &#34;Doctor Ludenberg&#34; is responsible. - Field Agent James//
