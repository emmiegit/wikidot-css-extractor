[[size large]]**Rules of Engagement:**[[/size]]

Do not engage without direct permission from Central Command. Do not engage with any SCP Foundation personnel monitoring KTE-7406-Cyan without direct permission from Central Command. The known threat entity is to be solely monitored by newly recruited undercover agent John &#39;&#39;Snakey&#39;&#39; Holland (See PSYCHE Records). Agent &#39;&#39;Snakey&#39;&#39; tried to get the Foundation to build an outpost subordinate to Site-88. If such an outpost is built, KTE-7406-Cyan could be destroyed during its transfer between the main Facility and the outpost. Only Central Command has the authority to decide when and where to destroy KTE-7406-Cyan.

It is formally forbidden to reveal to agent John Holland that the electromagnetic waves which caused the containment breach at Site-88, and thus indirectly caused the death of his colleague and friend, Dr. Albert Fleming, had in fact been sponsored by the UNGOC. 

[[size large]]**Description:**[[/size]]

KTE-7406-Cyan is a completely black humanoid entity measuring approximately 2 meters high. The entity can only be seen by the eyes of its victim or with the help of infrared goggles. The threat entity feeds on the fear and mental degradation of a subject throughout complicated stages of stalking. These stages begin with nightmares and end with heavy PTSD and madness. 

After the last stage, KTE-7406-Cyan will start to look for other victims to nourish on. Even though KTE-7406-Cyan will be psychologically detached from its victims at this point, said victims will still suffer from the effect the threat entity has caused. Traumatic hallucinations are mainly reported. It is estimated that recovery is impossible.

KTE-7406-Cyan was first identified in Clarksville, Montgomery County, Tennessee. After a drastic increase in the number of cases of dementia and severe paranoia recorded by the USDHHS in the area, Central Command dispatched Strike Team 4202 &#39;&#39;Spectral Hunters&#39;&#39; with orders to identify and destroy any present parathreat. Strike Team 4202 identified the threat but failed to destroy it (See PHYSICS Records). KTE-7406-Cyan is now detained by the SCP Foundation under the designation &#39;&#39;SCP-7406&#39;&#39;.

Victims of KTE-7406-Cyan have been identified by PHYSICS division, and have undergone an interview in order to better understand and destroy the parathreat. (See PHYSICS Records)

//Agent Handerson enters the room where is located Mr. Scott Laurier. He sits down.//

**Agent Handerson:** Hello //monsieur//. My name is François Dumont, from the WHO.

**Scott Laurier:** Mornin&#39;.

**Agent Handerson:** How are you? I&#39;ve been told you were suffering from some kind of paranoia, having the feeling you were... observed?

**Scott Laurier:** Why is everyone so surprised about my case? It started with the feds and now it&#39;s the whole damn world organization!

**Agent Handerson:** I&#39;m sorry Mr. Laurier, but I don&#39;t understand. You&#39;ve been seen by federal agents before my arrival?

**Scott Laurier:** Yeah! From the Department of Health and Human Services or I don&#39;t know what.

**Agent Handerson:** That&#39;s odd... You weren&#39;t in their system.

**Scott Laurier:** How&#39;d you know that?

**Agent Handerson:** Give me one minute, I&#39;ll be back.

//Agent Handerson leaves the room and proceeded to contact Central Command about these federal agents from the Department of Health. It is reported that Agent &#39;&#39;Snakey&#39;&#39; had previously interviewed the victim, but no further information was available.//

**Agent Handerson:** Could you describe these... officials for me?

//Mr. Scott Laurier is seen hyperventilating. He starts screaming. Agent Handerson tries to calm Mr. Laurier.//

**Scott Laurier:** DON&#39;T EVER CONTACT ME AGAIN!

**Agent Handerson:** Sir, please calm down.

**Scott Laurier:** It&#39;s always there with me, but it gets worse each time you pseudo-medics try to come here! Leave my retirement center alone! 

**Agent Handerson:** Please, Mr. Laurier, I just want to help you.

**Scott Laurier:** You&#39;re just making it angrier! He&#39;s going to kill us all, I know it will...

//Mr. Scott Laurier starts to smash his head against the wall of the room. The noise generated alerted two medical attendants, who escorted Mr. Laurier back to his apartment.//

**Agent Handerson:** I&#39;m sorry but I am not seeing anything. Maybe we can talk this out? Now could you please remove your hand from my...

//Mrs. Judy Roberts is seen tightening his grip around Agent Handerson&#39;s neck. Two armed agents enter the room. Mrs. Roberts is fatally shot.//

**Agent Handerson:** Good morning Mr. Lance. I&#39;m François Dumont, from the WHO.

**Andrew Lance:** How do you know my name?

**Agent Handerson:** If I&#39;m sent here to help you, they would at least give me your name, don&#39;t you think?

**Andrew Lance:** I guess everything about us is known by someone else&#39;s boss these days.

**Agent Handerson:** You reported feeling observed.

//Agent Handerson looks down at his papers.//

**Agent Handerson:** Can you tell me more about... Hey. Hey! Mr. Lance.

//Mr. Andrew Lance is unresponsive. He is not seen moving.//

**Agent Handerson:** Hey! Wake up! What is happening?

**Andrew Lance:** Controlled... We are... all... controlled.

**Agent Handerson:** Mr. Lance! Andrew! Are you okay?

**Andrew Lance:** It is capable of everything. It is everywhere.

//Mr. Lance seems to be coming out of his trance.//

**Andrew Lance:** I&#39;m sorry, did you say something? I lost track of the conversation for a moment.

**Agent Handerson:** Do you sometimes experience mental blackouts? Trances?

**Andrew Lance:** No. Why? It&#39;s not like I should, right?

//Mr. Andrew Lance gets up. He takes a few steps towards the door, then collapses. He is brought out of the room by two medical staff.//

**Subject:** Near Unknown Foundation Outpost. ~ SCP Foundation&#39;s Site-88.

[BEGIN LOG]

**Operative Abakumov:** ...And we&#39;ve been here for officially 4 hours.

**Operative Abara:** You don&#39;t like staying still, Piotr?

**Operative Oliveira:** Those Soviet feet need to rest once in a while!

**Operative Abakumov:** And why am I the only one being mocked for its origins?

**Sgt. Williams:** Your accent makes it funnier when you&#39;re angry.

**Operative Perreault:** Why is that truck late? 

**Lieutenant Bettencourt:** Agent Snakey said they would be here. I hope he wasn&#39;t caught.

**Operative Abara:** Well, they obviously aren&#39;t here.

**Lieutenant Bettencourt:** You never got taught patience at the Academy?

**Operative Abara:** What we learn at the Academy is how to destroy threat entities. You know? The thing we&#39;re not doing right now?

**Lieutenant Bettencourt:** Just wait, Abara. You&#39;re still getting paid for this.

**Operative Perreault:** Imagine if we weren&#39;t...

**Operative Abara:** Don&#39;t imagine too much. They&#39;re perfectly capable of not paying us for this crap.

**Strike Team Leader:** Everyone in the ditch. They&#39;re on their way.

**Sgt. Williams:** Foundation van, inbound.

**Strike Team Leader:** Use the infrared goggles.

**Operative Perreault:** Parathreat located. It&#39;s following the truck.

**Strike Team Leader:** There is a Foundation Task Force in that truck, accompanied by agent Snakey. 

**Lieutenant Bettencourt:** And a &#39;&#39;member of D-Class personnel&#39;&#39;. He is the current victim of KTE-7406-Cyan, and the reason why the parathreat is following that truck. If possible, extract him.

**Strike Team Leader:** Abara, Oliveira, and Williams, you will neutralize the Task Force with non-lethal equipment. Remember, we do not want to create a diplomatic incident.

**Lieutenant Bettencourt:** We do not kill any human being. Only the parathreat. And no mention of the GOC, they don&#39;t know it&#39;s us, and it&#39;s perfect that way.

**Strike Team Leader:** Bettencourt, Perreault, and myself will eliminate the parathreat. Abakumov, you take care of making contact with Snakey and getting him out of here.  We do it clean, boys. Aim for the head, and get out as soon as the parathreat is eliminated. 4202?

**Rest Of Strike Team 4202:** Spectral Hunters!

**Strike Team Leader:** Alright. Operative Perreault, Burst the tires of that truck.

//Operative Perreault fires one round in each of the truck&#39;s right-hand tires. The truck is seen stopping.//

**Strike Team Leader:** You know what to do. Go! Go! Go!

//The SCP Foundation&#39;s Task Force is neutralized by Operative Abara, Operative Oliveira, and Sgt. Williams. Parathreat KTE-7406-Cyan is shot several times in the head and torso, before collapsing. Strike Team 4202 leaves the area, escaping by// ██ █████ ████.
