[[size 150%]]**Special Detainment Treatment:** Only action necessary is the restricted access of SDT-62 to SL-2 personnel and higher.[[/size]]
----
[[size 130%]]**Specialised Description of Traits:** Item SDT-62 has the anomalous ability to appear and disappear at scheduled intervals. This is observed to occur whenever SDT-62 moves along the dimensional plane, with the item disappearing in the interim of two separate realities. SDT-62 cannot be entered even with applied force. It also has the ability to withstand an incredibly high amount of damage inflicted onto it. While speculative, SDT-62 is theorized to have the unique ability to travel through time in a similar fashion to interdimensional travel.
----
**Item Description:** SDT-62 is an interdimensional bus of a much older model than modern ones. It appears to originate from the past, yet shows no signs of deterioration both temporally and dimensionally. In our base reality: Dimension-6193EH, SDT-62 uniformly appears at Location-62.[[footnote]]62 miles SE of ##d5ffab|[DATA EXPUNGED BY GCP FORCE DUE TO INFORMATION WHICH MAY RISK A COMPLETE COLLAPSE OF ORDER WITHIN DIMENSION-6193C]##[[/footnote]] This location is not believed to exhibit any anomalous properties as observed through extensive testing (See **Tests-62/03-08**). SDT-62 is currently driven by George Pollen, an individual with no retrievable identity who researchers believe may have been create by SDT-62 itself. Following Test-62/31, SDT-62 no longer opens its doors to any individuals originating from Dimension-6193EH.
----
**Reason for classification as an SDT object:** SDT-62 has been classified as such due to the inexplicable nature of its appearance and its great withstanding of external forces.

||~ Test # ||~ Instructions ||~ Findings ||
||= 1 || **Control:** Travel to Dimension-6193EG using SDT-62. _
**Variable 1/2:** Travel to Dimension-6193EG three days into the past/future. || **Control** works as expected, albeit with minor hesitation due to the employment of much older communication systems. _
**Variable 1** may have succeeded in traveling time, however exact temporal displacement is unknown. Landscape found looks similar to the equivalent landscape of Dimension-6913EG but this is unconfirmed and hence location reached in **Test-62/01/V1** has been classified as Dimension-6913EGA. _
No personnel executing **Variable 2** has returned and are presumed dead. ||
||= 2 || **Control:** Travel to Dimension-6193EG using SDT-62 then return to Dimension-6193EH. _
**Variable 1/2:** Travel to Dimension-6193EG then to Dimension-6193EH three days into the past/future. || **Control** succeeds. _
**Variable 1** has similar outcome to **Test-62/01/V1**, however exact correlations between Dimension-6193EH from **Control** and Dimension-6193EH from **Variable 1** were detected. Corp knowledge of how to travel through time using SDT-62 is being refined. _
[{{Data of **Test-62/02/V2** has been deleted due to compromising information.}}] Following this, all attempts to travel to the future have been deemed too unsafe and are henceforth prohibited during testing. ||

= [[size 130%]]Following orders from the Enforcers of Ethical Protocol (EEP), experimentation involving travelling on SDT-62 has been put on hold until further notice.[[/size]]

||= 3 || **Control:** Photograph Location-62 from three different angles, ensuring details on Location-62&#39;s shelter is visible. _
**Variable 1:** Using a blow gun, remove any dust or grime from Location-62&#39;s shelter. Then, photograph Location-62 from three different angles, ensuring details on Location-62&#39;s shelter is visible. _
**Variable 2:** Using a knife, scrape off any dust or grime from Location-62&#39;s shelter. Then, photograph Location-62 from three different angles, ensuring details on Location-62&#39;s shelter is visible. || During **Control**, Location-62&#39;s shelter was covered in a thick layer of dust and grease, obscuring its appearance as an old-fashioned bus shelter. _
Following **Variable 1**, the overall shape and design of Location-62&#39;s shelter was much more discernible. _
Following **Variable 2**, unique characters and symbols were found on Location-62&#39;s shelter which were previously covered by the dirt (See **Location-62 Shelter Symbols Deciphered**). ||
||= 4 || **Control:** See **Test-62/03/C**. _
**Variable 1:** Using a hose, test the shelter&#39;s ability to withstand water. Then, follow **Test-62/03/C**. _
**Variable 2:** Using the blood buckets, test the shelter&#39;s ability to withstand blood. Then, follow **Test-62/03/C**. || During **Control**, shelter appears to be a blue, old-fashioned bus shelter with typical deterioration as would be expected of a shelter with its presumed age. _
After **Variable 1**, the shelter appeared to be reacting typical of the materials used to create a shelter of its design. _
After **Variable 2**, the shelter reacted as normal. It is to be noted that Location-62&#39;s shelter is now in the need for a cleaning as the blood used has stained its outer walls. ||
||||||= ... ||
||= 6 || **Control:** See **Test-62/05/C**. _
**Variable 1:** Using a blow torch, test the shelter&#39;s ability to withstand extreme heat. Then, follow **Test-62/05/C**. _
**Variable 2:** Install the portable blast freezer around the shelter to test the shelter&#39;s ability to withstand extreme cold. Then, follow **Test-62/05/C**. || **Control:** Shelter appears as usual. _
Shelter appears to warp following **Variable 1**. _
Warped shelter solidifies as a result of extreme cold after **Variable 2**. _
All reactions appear to be normal. ||
||= 7 || **Control:** See **Test-62/05/C**. _
**Variable:** Detonate a packet of C-4 inside of the shelter. Then, follow **Test-62/05/C**. || **Control:** Shelter appears normal, aside from the warping caused by **Test-62/06/V1**. _
**Variable:** Whole of shelter is demolished. No more experiments can be made on the shelter following this. ||

= [[size 130%]]In light of an update to EEP regulation regarding SDT-62, experimentation involving traveling on SDT-62 has henceforth been allowed under the condition that updated EEP protocols are strictly adhered to.[[/size]]

||= 8 || **Control:** Travel to Dimension-6193EI using SDT-62. _
**Variable 1:** Travel to Dimension-6193EI one day into the past using SDT-62. _
**Variable 2:** Travel to Dimension-6193EI three days into the past using SDT-62. || **Control** works as intended. _
**Variable 1** shows that the Corp are close to pinpointing how to temporally displace individuals riding SDT-62, with it resulting in individuals travelling to Dimension-6193EI one week into the past exactly. _
**Variable 2** works similarly, however only temporally displaced people three hours into the past. ||
||||||= ... ||
||= 12 || **Control:** Travel to Dimension-6193EJ using SDT-62. _
**Variable 1/2/3:** Travel to Dimension-6193EJ one week/month/year into the past using SDT-62 || **Control** works as intended. _
With use of the refined SDT-62 Temporal Displacement Guide,[[footnote]]**[ACCESS DENIED DUE TO INSUFFICIENT SECURITY CLEARANCE]** [[/footnote]] **Variables 1, 2** and **3** all worked as intended. The Corp are now putting in research to detect any continuity errors caused through temporal displacement through SDT-62. ||

= [[size 130%]]While efforts to research continuity errors formed through use of SDT-62 are underway, experimental focus has now been placed on controlling the appearance and disappearance of SDT-62.[[/size]]

||= 13 || **Control:** Record times of SDT-62&#39;s appearance at Location-62. _
**Variable:** Park standard-sized motorized vehicle at Location-62 in the way of where SDT-62 usually apparates. || **Control** found that SDT-62 appears twice every day, once at 700 hours and at 1900 hours. _
During **Variable**, motorized vehicle was parked at Location-62 at approximately 1840 hours. When SDT-62 appeared, it stopped behind the vehicle and acted as normal. Upon departing, it turned and overtook the vehicle. It appears that this had very little change in the behaviour of SDT-62. ||
||||||= ... ||
||= 17 || {{NOTE: Following rigorous testing to block SDT-62 from leaving Location-62 and hence disappearing, it appears we need to test other methods to control SDT-62.}} _
**Control:** Allow SDT-62 to appear and disappear as normal and record findings. _
**Variable:** On the road adjacent to Location-62, apply petroleum to ensure travel on road will result in a loss of control of vehicle. || **Control** works as intended. _
Upon appearing after **Variable** was put in place, SDT-62 notably had no change in behaviour despite the change in road conditions. It is theorized that SDT-62 is not affected by reality, however this would directly contradict actions observed in **Test-62/13**. ||
||||||= ... ||
||= 21 || {{NOTE: After continual failed attempts to control SDT-62, experimentation on how to cause damage SDT-62 has begun.}} _
**Control:** Analyse condition of SDT-62. _
**Variable:** Strike the outer walls of SDT-62 with a hammer once the item comes to a halt and opens its doors. Then, analyse condition of SDT-62. || **Control:** SDT-62 appears to have no significant wear despite events from Tests-62/15-16 and its presumed age based on the old-fashioned model of interdimensional public transport it exhibits. _
During **Variable**, hammer bounces back a significant amount after striking SDT-62. No damage is visible on the walls, however SDT-62 immediately after **Variable** closed its doors and drove away from Location-62 swiftly. ||
||||||= ... ||
||= 23 || **Control:** Analyse condition of SDT-62. _
**Variable:** Use blow torch on outer walls of SDT-62 once the item comes to a halt and opens its doors. Then, analyse condition of SDT-62. || **Control:** SDT-62 appears as normal. _
**Variable** causes no damage to exterior of SDT-62 and leaves in a similar fashion to Tests-62/21-22. SDT-62 appears to be extremely heat-resistant. ||

= [[size 130%]]As a result of a new technological breakthrough, devices with the ability to prevent interdimensional travel have been reserved for use on SDT-62 during experimentation.[[/size]]

||= 24 || Interdimensional Inhibitors are placed around Location-62 35 minutes prior to scheduled SDT-62 appearance. || SDT-62 behaves as normal until attempting to leave Location-62, after which SDT-62 loses all functionality and all personnel aboard item disappear through unknown means. ||

= [[size 130%]]Following Test-62/24, SDT-62 has been transported to a garage located at Area-13 where physical tests on item will commence. Note that Interdimensional Inhibitors should be functional surrounding SDT-62 at all times.[[/size]]

||= 25 || Acidic solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) is to be applied directly to key areas[[footnote]]Outer walls, roof, passenger seats, floor and wheels[[/footnote]] of SDT-62. || Acid had no significant effect on SDT-62 in any of the applied areas. ||
||||||= ... ||
||= 27 || Detonate three packets of C-4 spread out within the interior of SDT-62. || Immediately following detonation of explosives, SDT-62 inexplicably disappears. {{NOTE: SDT-62 reappears at 900 hours the following day and the scheduled appearances of SDT-62 at Location-62 have been offset by 2 hours.}} ||
||= 28 || Capture the driver of SDT-62 through any means necessary. || While resistance was enacted from driver, a successful capturing of a Frank Bordeo (henceforth Subject-62) was executed. Subject has been put in for questioning. ||

= [[size 130%]]Despite extensive attempts to communicate with Subject-62, including enhanced interrogation techniques, subject shows no sign of comprehension or ability to communicate. Subject-62 displays extreme signs of distress, however remains silent. Following the capture of Subject-62, SDT-62 is now driven by an individual going by the name George Pollen.[[/size]]

||= 29 || Test Subject-62 for any anomalous properties. || Subject-62 exhibits no such attributes. Subject appears to be a typical human being, albeit with limited communicative abilities. ||
||= 30 || Subject-62 is to be directed to drive a standard-sized motorized vehicle. || Subject-62 fails to exhibit any ability to drive vehicle, even following strenuous instruction. ||
||= 31 ||= [DATA EXPUNGED] || Subject-62 expires. ||

= [[size 130%]]Following the termination of Subject-62, entry into SDT-62 has been prevented as a result of the item no longer opening its doors upon stopping at Location-62. Research regarding alternate ways to continue experimentation on SDT-62 is ongoing.[[/size]]

= [[size 130%]]__**Decommissioning of SDT-62**__[[/size]]
[[size 130%]]
Following regulation from the Great Convergence Prevention (GCP) Force, experimentation on SDT-62 is to be halted effective immediately due to its high risk of causing a Great Convergence (GC). Any attempts to ride SDT-62 will be met with immediate forceful action up to and including termination. As of 17/6/2115, SDT-62 will continue to be documented as an SDT object due to its nature still being anomalous and unexplained despite our rigorous experimentation. We are hoping we can figure out a compromise to continue research on SDT-62 without risking a GC. Otherwise, this document will be archived and will not be edited [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7805/offset/1 until further notice].
