__**POI-78559 Personal Statement:**__
&gt; Hello everyone!
&gt; 
&gt; Welcome to my author page. I am currently a college student with a great interest in bettering my writing skill, which is why I&#39;m getting a minor in creative writing. I&#39;ve written a few SCPs so far, and I&#39;m so happy to be among the great writers of this site. I am always looking to improve my skill, so please give feedback on any and all of my works here! I am always open to being messaged any questions, comments, or just casual conversation topics, so please, feel free to smash that &#34;Write Private Message&#34; button.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m happy to be here on this website. Thank you all for giving me a proper creative outlet where I can actually feel like people are enjoying my works.
&gt; 
&gt; Much love,
&gt; //Lady Zero//

**__Known Works:__**

The following are categorized by order of discovery.

* [[[SCP-3778|SCP-3778 &#34;We Are Possum. We Are Legion.&#34;]]]
&gt; **Authorial Commentary:** Anomalous grapes that make opossums gain sapience. My favorite animals are opossums so I figured that&#39;d be a lovely thing to write about. This was my first article that actually managed to //stay// on the mainsite (and my third ever written) so I feel rather proud of this one.

* [[[SCP-4994|SCP-4994 &#34;An Ideal Foundation&#34;]]]
&gt; **Authorial Commentary:** Quite possibly the best article I have written or will write for the Foundation. A parallel, more successful version of the Foundation that is used by the OTL Foundation for advice. Has the highest rating of all my articles.

* [[[SCP-4899|SCP-4899 &#34;Blackbody&#34;]]]
&gt; **Authorial Commentary:** An anomalous radio source from 144 light years away seems to be transmitting photos of places about to experience disaster. I got the name and idea from a Death Grips song.

* [[[SCP-4250|SCP-4250 &#34;Colorful Pens With Thematic Ends&#34;]]]
&gt; **Authorial Commentary:** Pens designed by an AWCY member that have compulsory writing effects, with different colors corresponding to different themes. The first one I&#39;ve written since I moved to college. Was inspired by a book I read when I was a kid.

More works are expected to follow. Foundation assets are recommended to continue watching for increases in POI-78559&#39;s writing proficiency, and to view any new works written. Upvotes encouraged, //only if// such works merit them.

**Secure, Contain, Protect.**
