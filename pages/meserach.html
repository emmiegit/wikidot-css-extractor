[[tab A Little About Me]]
Hi, I&#39;m Meserach. I was born in 1986, I live in the UK, I&#39;m a white trans woman, pronouns she/her.

I started my authorial career on the SCP wiki back in 2013, after having read the site and lurked around various parts of it for about a year or so? I forget. Back then I wrote [[[SCP-1442]]]. It was a big success in very quick time, and something about that made me terrified to try and write another thing. Plus I just had no ideas as good as it. So after tinkering around with methods of trying to find inspiration,  writing a bunch of half finished drafts, hanging out on IRC, and even judging the 2014 GOI contest for some reason (I was judge Fanta), I eventually fell away from the site.

Fast forward to four years later, 2017. I became a parent that year, started transitioning, and also my dad died. It was Quite the Year.

Something about all that made me want to reconnect with this site, and I did. I took part in [[*user Rimple]]&#39;s Draft Swap, and got assigned a draft about a Denny&#39;s that was also a flowering plant. That became [[[SCP-3694]]]. It&#39;s never been a big performer, but I like it.

Hanging around IRC that year, I happened to note that [[[SCP-351]]] was close to getting negative rating, and in collaboration with [[*user NatVoltaic]], we applied to rewrite it. It has an actual story now!

That third credit qualified me for an author page, so naturally I didn&#39;t make one for five years. Hung out a bit more but fell away again, largely because logging in to IRC and staying on it enough to participate was a pain on my smartphone, and parenthood is extremely distracting so I was rarely at my desktop any more.

Fast forward to 2022. My daughter is in school now and I suddenly have free time again. One of my reactivate interests is writing, so I check out SCP again, which has really exploded in content terms over those five years. I fall back in love with it, and luckily enough a contest is starting up around when I&#39;m looking in: DepartmentCon.

I&#39;d had the vague idea for what became the Telecommunications Monitoring Office back in my 2017 era. Back then it was just going to be a single tale rather than a full department  just to explore what it&#39;s like to be a Foundation staffer at a low level of clearance and importance. In the context of DepartmentCon, it blossomed into a whole thing which I&#39;m very proud of. I&#39;m the primary writer on four of the pages my team enters. And... well,  that brings us up to date at the time of writing.

[[tab Contact and Living Will]]
I&#39;m Meserach#4776 on Discord. That&#39;s by far the best way to contact me for SCP stuff, and for now it&#39;s also the only way. I should work out some kind of backup.

Nobody in the community has my phone number, and for now that&#39;s how I&#39;d like it to remain.

If I&#39;m absent from the wiki for five years, or I die or am otherwise incapacitated, I authorise [[*user Dysadron]] to take ownership of my works and make whatever decisions about them are required.

Apparently it&#39;s traditional to have a space visitors are allowed to leave messages on. Have at it, you hyenas.

First, and why don&#39;t you also come to the **{{[[[jack-waltz |basement]]]}}**.

Second! Loved working with you for Deptcon and I can&#39;t wait to interact with you in the future :) you&#39;re a pretty amazing author and I feel honored to have been your teammate! -**[[*user BattleblockB0ss]]**
