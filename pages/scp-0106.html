&gt; ++ NOTICE FROM O5 COMMAND REGARDING SCP-106 
&gt; 
&gt; {{**SCP-106 poses a unique threat to containment efforts due to its anomalous effects. As such, the Special Containment Procedures provided in this file are not intended to be an exhaustive summary of circumstances that could result in a containment breach. Staff assigned to SCP-106 are advised to regularly review this file for the latest information regarding SCP-106 as it becomes available.**}}

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-106 is, at present, effectively uncontainable. All recorded manifestations of SCP-106 have resulted in a considerable threat to normalcy along with high civilian loss of life, rendering Foundation responses frequently impotent. Containment is therefore focused on suppression of public knowledge of SCP-106 and quarantining civilian areas in which SCP-106 is known to have manifested. To this end, Mobile Task Force 106-Alpha  (&#34;Get Off My Lawn&#34;) has been authorized to assist in ongoing disinformation campaigns in regions known to have been affected by SCP-106. MTF 106-Alpha is to provide appropriate cover stories, ranging from spree killings to toxic waste accidents, in order to provide plausible explanations for the effects of SCP-106. In such cases where a cover story cannot be reasonably utilized, large-scale use of Class-B amnestics is permitted.

SCP-106, when encountered by field operatives or elements of MTF 106-Alpha, can be temporarily slowed or forced to prematurely return to the Pocket Dimension through the use of abruptly activated, extremely intense lights. To facilitate mitigation of SCP-106&#39;s anomalous effects in the field, all personnel conducting operations in close proximity to SCP-106 must carry portable light devices capable of generating light in excess of 80,000 lumens. SCP-106 has also demonstrated confusion when presented with structures or areas comprised of numerous rooms and hallways; as such, any physical interaction with SCP-106 is to be conducted in apartment complexes, office buildings, or other buildings of above-average size and internal complexity. 

All assets and personnel in direct physical contact with SCP-106 or its discharge are to be considered lost. No recovery efforts are authorized. 

**Description:** SCP-106 designates an amorphous entity of unknown genus and origin presumed to generally possess a humanoid shape. While SCP-106 is capable of assuming the form of any human subject it has previously made physical contact with, it seems to prefer the form of an elderly male in a state of dramatic decomposition and will utilize said form if stealth is not required or impossible.

The &#34;natural&#34; form of SCP-106, if it possesses such a form, is unknown as it has exclusively been observed utilizing either the aforementioned elderly form or the form of another human subject. Analysis of SCP-106&#39;s physical composition and nature is further complicated by it potentially being comprised of multiple individual subjects simultaneously, as such behavior, though infrequent, has been observed on multiple occasions. The general characteristics of SCP-106 instances consist of the production of an unknown black substance that, upon contact with any matter, causes a degenerative effect analogous to corrosion or biological decomposition depending on the nature of the material affected.

SCP-106 is a sapient predator. It will actively pursue human subjects in the 20 to 35 age bracket, attempting to immobilize them through severe damage to tendons or internal organs prior to drawing them into a non-Euclidean space referred to as the &#34;pocket dimension.&#34; Descriptions of this pocket dimension originate solely from eyewitnesses, --as all cameras and other recording devices sustain critical damage upon entry-- [REVISED; SEE ADDENDUM II]. Of note is the alleged presence of approximately 25,000 to 30,000 living human subjects, all of whom appear to be in a state of paralysis. While these subjects are stated to remain capable of vocalizing, any movement beyond the facial region is seemingly impossible. Nearly all subjects are described as children or adolescents. SCP-106 possesses virtually unrestricted control over the geometric configuration of the pocket dimension, and while departure from it is possible, SCP-106 appears to aggressively pursue subjects who escape, preferring them over other prey subjects.

SCP-106 demonstrates unusual competence in navigating Foundation installations, having successfully initiated breach events in three (3) separate containment facilities since its initial apprehension by the Foundation. SCP-106 does not appear to be confused or otherwise dissuaded by Foundation facilities of high complexity even when such complexity makes them virtually unnavigable to staff. It is presumed that SCP-106&#39;s knowledge of Foundation architecture and internal facility layouts is due to ███████ ███, and ████████ following ███████ [FURTHER INFORMATION REDACTED. SEE ADDENDUM II]

**Excerpt from 106 Field Manual:** 
&gt; //[Pages 1-39 excluded for brevity]// 
&gt; 
&gt; {{**Behavioral Notes**}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{SCP-106 is generally understood to exhibit behavior consistent with one of three possible &#34;states,&#34; though deviations from these states are not impossible. This information is intended to function as an aid, not an exhaustive list of possible circumstances in which SCP-106 could be encountered.}}
&gt; 
&gt; **{{Idle:** When not engaged in other behaviors, SCP-106 is typically found hanging from the ceiling of its containment chamber or standing in place in a manner best described as catatonic. It will disregard most external stimuli, save for the introduction of potential prey or an immediate opportunity at escaping its cell. While SCP-106 is less overtly aggressive in this state, it is not &#34;safe&#34;; it remains fully aware of its surroundings and can, at any time, enter a more active state. SCP-106 has used this state as a means of inducing a false sense of security in site staff numerous times.}}
&gt; 
&gt; **{{Hunting:** This state refers to any behavior consistent with the pursuit of prey subjects or attempting to breach containment. SCP-106 is extremely aggressive and, when it has selected a subject to target, will follow them relentlessly. It appears to deliberately prolong hunting sessions, consistently avoiding outright killing or capturing subjects even when presented with a situation in which it could do so immediately. Subjects often sustain injuries designed to cause extreme physical pain or otherwise slow them down but are not pulled into the Pocket Dimension until completely fatigued or incapacitated. SCP-106 demonstrates an intuitive knowledge of the layout of structures it operates within and can appear from walls, doors, or other surfaces in order to cut off escape routes.}}

**Addendum I: Interview 106-A**

Interview conducted following initial identification of SCP-106.

&gt; **Subject**: Description of SCP-106 and &#34;Pocket Dimension&#34;
&gt; **Interviewer**: Dr. Richards
&gt; **Interviewee**: Rachael Smith
&gt; 
&gt; Interviewee (Rachael Smith) is a 19 year old Caucasian female of average physical build with no apparent illnesses or injuries save for those sustained due to exposure to SCP-106. Damage appears to be largely isolated to the lower extremities, with the left Achilles tendon injured beyond repair.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Richards**: Good evening, Rachael. How are you feeling?
&gt; 
&gt; **Rachael Smith**: I guess I&#39;m fine. It hurts a little.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Richards**: Sorry, what does?
&gt; 
&gt; **Smith:** [Gesturing to her left leg] The lower part of it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards**: I see. We can have somebody from medical take a look at that in a bit. I just wanted to briefly ask you a few questions regarding what you saw yesterday.
&gt; 
&gt; **Smith**: Look, with all due respect, Doctor, I already told —
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards**: Yes. Yes, I know. You told the recovery team everything about what you saw, and I don&#39;t mean to make you relieve anything upsetting. I just need to take some notes for my records and we&#39;ll send you on your way.
&gt; 
&gt; **Smith**: Wait — on my way? What do you mean?
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards**: Well, it&#39;s standard procedure —
&gt; 
&gt; **Smith**: No, wait. Hold on. Please don&#39;t send me back out there. Don&#39;t leave me alone.
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards**: Are you alright?
&gt; 
&gt; **Smith**: I just — I just don&#39;t want to be alone right now. You guys know about it, right? I&#39;m not the first person you&#39;ve talked to about this. You have to have something. Anything. Please.
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards**: Let&#39;s, uh…let&#39;s just get the questions out of the way first, then I&#39;ll see what I can do. Now then — you mentioned to the recovery team that you heard a &#34;crackling,&#34; like popcorn. Can you explain?
&gt; 
&gt; [Smith inhales sharply before replying.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Smith**: I&#39;m a, uh. A gas station attendant. I was working with Caleb. We&#39;ve been working together…five? Maybe six years. Caleb and I, we — we close the shop up. Clean any spills, restock shelves that are low, that sort of thing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards**: How old is Caleb?
&gt; 
&gt; **Smith**: 17. It&#39;s his first job.
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** Did you notice anything strange about Caleb during previous shifts? Any weird behavior or odd mannerisms? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Smith:** No. Can&#39;t say I did. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards**: Right. Please continue.
&gt; 
&gt; **Smith**: Caleb likes to clean the popcorn machine. Why a gas station has a popcorn machine, I don&#39;t know. But he likes cleaning it. He used to say the smell reminded him of seeing movies with his dad. He, uh — not important. But he liked cleaning it. So he started to clean it, like he always does, and I walked over to the candy aisle to restock some candy. Things were fine for a bit, but then, he — he started complaining about a headache. No, a migraine.
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards**: Anything unusual about that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Smith**: Not really, except that he&#39;s a tough kid. Really doesn&#39;t bitch about pain. Like, ever. I guess he tried to ignore it for a few minutes, but he kept scratching the back of his head. He said it was getting worse and that he might need to take something for it, but kept working. I didn&#39;t think anything of it.
&gt; 
&gt; [Smith begins breathing more rapidly.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Smith**: A couple more minutes pass, and he starts moaning. It was this weird, uncontrollable moan. I guess he couldn&#39;t help it. I asked if he was okay, and at first it sounded like he was trying to say he was, but then he stopped talking. Again, Caleb&#39;s a tough kid, so I think nothing of it, right? But then I hear crackling. Like popcorn. I thought maybe he turned on the machine by accident or something — I don&#39;t know what I was thinking. But he was getting loud.
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards**: Why didn&#39;t you investigate more intensely? Your reactions seem almost negligent. Did you know he was injured at the time? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Smith:** No -- no, I just -- I didn&#39;t know what to do. I wasn&#39;t thinking.
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** I&#39;m not trying to insult you or make you feel worse, Ms. Smith, but it just seems odd. Why didn&#39;t you express more concern if this was such a rare occurrence? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Smith**: Well, I went over to him. Put my hand on his back and asked if he wanted me to call someone. I assumed that maybe he was sick — some stomach flu. He said to go away. Really aggressively. So I did. I went back to restocking the candy. Twenty, maybe thirty seconds went by, and the crackling got louder. He stumbled out from behind the counter and moved towards me a little bit, and then fell on his face. I didn&#39;t know what to do. I was getting panicked. I started to call 911, but I couldn&#39;t hear anything over the crackling. The smell — Jesus.
&gt; 
&gt; [Richards hands Smith a cup of water.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Smith**: Thanks. As I&#39;m dialing — can&#39;t hear the phone, but you know, I was trying — I heard something slick. It sounded like wet pavement almost. Squeaky shoes? I turned around. He —
&gt; 
&gt; [Smith becomes visibly distressed.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Smith**: His skin was falling off. Like, peeling off. Like — fuck, like a fucking potato being peeled. But he was alive. He kept asking for help, but couldn&#39;t talk. Something was in his throat. It sounded like he was gargling saltwater. Blood and this…weird black shit started coming out of him. Skin kept falling off. I was just fucking frozen. I didn&#39;t know what to do. I didn&#39;t know what to do. Oh my God. Oh my God.
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards**: Ms. Smith, it&#39;s alright. Calm down. You&#39;re safe. I know this is difficult for you, but you&#39;re helping us immensely. Please continue for as long as you remain comfortable. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Smith**: His skin kept falling off. It was like something was cooking from the inside. I could hear something bubbling. These fucking — these boils kept popping up on his skin and bursting. Everything around him was coated in this bloody, black shit — it burned the entire store. The floor, the shelves, everything. I rolled him over. I don&#39;t remember why. I guess I thought he was choking on something. When I rolled him over, his fucking teeth spilled out of him. Oh my fucking God. Oh my God, Caleb —
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards**: Ms. Smith, I need you to calm down. We can postpone this interview and --
&gt; 
&gt; **Smith**: Please! Please! You can&#39;t let me go! You can&#39;t let me go! You —
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards** (to security): We need a sedative. Get a sedative, please.
&gt; 
&gt; **Smith**: He was smiling at me! He was smiling at me! Oh my God — oh my God — [Screaming] — No! Please! Please don&#39;t let me go! Please — [Screaming]

**Conclusion**: Subject was sedated and placed in temporary holding pending further assessment of her cognitive state. Interview terminated.

**Addendum II: Exploration Logs**

On ██/██/20██, Dr. Richards, in collaboration with elements of SCP-106 project staff, was able to develop a prototype anti-corrosive shielding capable of withstanding the effects of SCP-106&#39;s &#34;pocket dimension.&#34; This shielding allows for unmanned reconnaissance drones to enter the pocket dimension and maintain a live transmission feed for brief periods of time. Dr. Richards subsequently proposed a series of exploratory operations from within the pocket dimension. Though these were approved, only three explorations were completed before the project was suspended.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Display Exploration Log 001&#34; hide=&#34;Hide Log&#34;]]
&gt; MTF-106-Alpha, after encountering SCP-106 during Operation: Golden Ratchet, was able to provide considerable quantities of its discharge to project staff.  After a small twig vanishes upon contact with this discharge, it is confirmed to function as a secondary means of entering the pocket dimension. MTF 106-Alpha deploys unmanned reconnaissance drone and drives it into a large puddle of corrosive discharge. Drone vanishes, and after a few moments of the camera being unresponsive, it flickers back to life from within the pocket dimension. 
&gt; 
&gt; Initial footage captures what appears to be a dirt trail leading to a series of pillar-like structures floating above the ground in the distance. The remainder of the landscape is seemingly barren, comprised of a dirt-like substance and a red sky devoid of any clouds or obvious atmospheric objects. There is a constant downpour of a liquid that, upon initial discovery, is assumed to be rain. However, recording of the point of impact between this liquid and the ground shows it to slightly burn the soil, suggesting it is similar in composition to SCP-106&#39;s discharge. After some time spent acquainting themselves with the immediate area, team drives the drone forward towards the pillars. 
&gt; 
&gt; Upon approach, the pillars are found to be hovering above a set of similar but heavily damaged structures, all of which appear to be comprised of extremely corroded and barely intact metals. Many of the metal walls bear an insignia far too damaged to clearly be visible. The drone moves forward, entering what appears to be an auxiliary hallway containing numerous small rooms. Interference intensifies, making the transmission noticeably more difficult to make out clearly. Drone approaches a small room with its metal door slightly ajar. At this point, audio consistent with grunting and groaning becomes audible to the drone. Its positional speakers indicate that the sound is originating from the rear. The drone turns 180 degrees and moves in the direction of the sound.
&gt; 
&gt; After exiting this hole, the drone has been transported to an area geometrically inconsistent with the entry point. The sound from prior to this remains audible, but seems to be coming from a new direction. Task force moves the drone forward, attempting to continue their pursuit of the audio. Audio becomes louder as the drone approaches what appears to be an extremely damaged bedroom. Upon arrival at a slightly ajar wooden door, task force stops the drone and consults O5 Command regarding how they should proceed, expecting the drone to be lost upon discovering the source of the audio. O5 Command advises task force to proceed inside the room. 
&gt; 
&gt; Drone deploys an extended arm to open the door, then drives inside. Within the room are a set of broken bookshelves, various kitchen appliances, and considerable quantities of human bodily fluids, including blood, semen, and mucus. The drone’s camera becomes slightly coated in an unidentified viscous substance, rendering the transmission blurred. When it turns 90 degrees to the left, a figure resembling a human torso is seen conjoined to the wall by several pieces of rebar. All organs and appendages below the waist are missing. While initially dormant, exposure to the air outside of the room causes this figure to become animate, screaming and thrashing wildly in the direction of the drone. This, in turn, causes the rebar within its flesh to begin moving into the wall, apparently inflicting further damage to the figure. The drone picks up a distinct &#34;crackling&#34; noise as a thick black liquid begins to pour into the room from a ventilation shaft above the figure, burning its skin and musculature as it trickles upon it. 
&gt; 
&gt; The wall adjacent to the left side of the figure begins swaying rhythmically, gradually reforming into a sheet of the black substance. The figure notices this and becomes more distressed, attempting to pull itself from the rebar and escape, though such efforts prove futile. The drone backs away slightly, sustaining further damage from the black liquid as it enters the room. In the final moments of the recording, SCP-106 is seen entering the room through the swaying wall, holding what appears to be a chain embedded into the shoulder of a young man stripped nude. It stops, noticing the drone, but makes no effort to destroy it. SCP-106 then approaches the figure on the wall; as the figure screams, SCP-106 inserts its hand into its chest, inflicting severe physical damage and causing it to scream loudly. SCP-106 is then seen &#34;snaking&#34; its hand into the figure&#39;s neck and out through its mouth; while the subject remains alive through this process, the damage to its internal organs and musculature is catastrophic. 
&gt; 
&gt; After several moments spent staring at the drone, SCP-106 drops the chain embedded in the second individual -- who remains motionless, apparently incapacitated by their injuries -- and focuses its attention on the subject embedded into the wall. It begins moving its hands rapidly, forcing the subject&#39;s mouth and throat to move against their will. The subject screams for a moment before being abruptly cut off; their vocalizations are replaced with a distinct voice in a low frequency range, presumed to originate from SCP-106. A single word is repeated three times before the subject&#39;s head disintegrates beyond recognizability: 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-106:** ...play? 
&gt; 
&gt; At this point, O5 Command orders the task force to retrieve the drone. Drone egresses from the area, recording laughing described variably as that of a human female and a human infant continues until the drone returns to the initial deployment site. Though there is no obvious way out of the pocket dimension, the camera cuts to static for several seconds before the drone is ejected from SCP-106&#39;s discharge at an extremely high velocity, severely wounding a member of MTF 106-Alpha.
&gt; 
&gt; Later inspection of the interior of the drone revealed the presence of several organic items subsequently determined to be human brain fragments. These fragments continued to emit electrical signals until placed into storage by the recovery team.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;Display Exploration Log 002&#34; hide=&#34;Hide Log&#34;]]
&gt; Initial conditions are identical to the previous exploration. Drone enters SCP-106&#39;s discharge and resumes transmission after several seconds of interruption. 
&gt; 
&gt; Upon reestablishment of the feed, drone is located in what appears to be a hallway comprised of numerous metal doors, all of which are intact. Lighting is brilliantly red, consistent with the previous exploration. The doors are adjacent to buttons that similarly seem to be intact and fully functional. Drone extends an arm forward and depresses a button; as expected, the adjacent door opens without issue. After briefly exploring one of these rooms, it is revealed that the interior is comprised of a small mattress, a sink, a toilet, and various small items of food that appear to be rotting or spoiled. Exploration of several other rooms yields similar findings, albeit with the occasional detection of human remains, typically in the form of bone fragments, small masses of flesh, or fingernails. 
&gt; 
&gt; Drone continues down the hallway, arriving at a bulkhead door that requires keycard access. There is an item to the left of the drone on the ground that, upon brief inspection, seems to be an appropriately sized keycard. The face of the keycard is illegible due to the presence of what appears to be smeared fecal matter and dried urine. Drone retrieves the keycard and swipes it along the appropriate reader next to the bulkhead door. After several seconds, the bulkhead door grinds open, stopping at several points because of damage to its internal mechanisms.  The drone continues inside and the bulkhead door shuts behind it automatically, plunging the room into darkness with near zero visibility. 
&gt; 
&gt; Task force remotely activates the drone&#39;s onboard flashlight. A black, bubbling mass is observed several centimeters in front of the drone&#39;s camera, moving slightly. It disappears after a moment, seemingly having moved. Drone continues forward. Task force detects that the drone&#39;s movement has slowed due to unknown reasons. A brief system diagnostic procedure reveals no damage to core systems or any onboard mechanisms. As the task force discusses how to proceed, the feed records two milky-white objects ascend from the ground in front of the camera, remaining still for several moments before vanishing. After the drone is moved forward again, velocity is determined to have returned to normal. 
&gt; 
&gt; Drone arrives at a second cube-shaped room within the main room. Room appears to have suffered considerable corrosion, the door to it slightly ajar and slowly liquifying. An insignia is observed on the outward face of the room&#39;s door, but it is obscured by the black substance. Task force informs O5 Command that recovery of the drone is unlikely should they proceed inside the room. O5 Command acknowledges this and orders task force to move drone inside of the room. Task force complies despite experiencing a second slowdown of the drone&#39;s velocity. The aforementioned milky-white objects are observed once more, though they remain in place far longer. The drone moves to the left to avoid them, its light casting upon the object to the rear of the objects.
&gt; 
&gt; Drone proceeds inside the room. The contents of the room prior to its current state are assumed to have been removed; the interior has been fully replaced by a large tunnel descending into the ground for an undetermined distance. The tunnel is comprised of a material similar to cobblestone, albeit with significant presence of the black substance. Having already categorized the drone as lost, O5 Command authorizes exploration of the tunnel. Task force moves the drone to the edge of the drop-off; before any further movement occurs, a large stone platform ascends through the tunnel, producing a loud grinding noise as it moves. It slows to a stop upon approaching the drone, seeming to &#34;wait&#34; for it. Task force moves the drone onto the platform, and within several seconds, it begins slowly descending into the tunnel. 
&gt; 
&gt; As the platform descends, drone continuously performs circular movements, surveying its surroundings. The walls, while initially very similar to cobblestone, become increasingly unrecognizable as the descent continues. Approximately three minutes into descent, black oblong objects begin to appear intermittently throughout the stone. Several of these objects seem to actively produce the black substance, some of it trickling onto the platform and causing a corrosive effect. Six minutes into descent, visibility improves, though all light is extremely red. Nine minutes into descent, the aforementioned oblong objects begin to vibrate slightly. 
&gt; 
&gt; Fifteen minutes into descent, oblong objects begin to violently shake. Several of them rotate, revealing that they are human faces, with connected bodies embedded into the stone. They begin to scream upon becoming visible to the drone, their eyes, noses, and ears having been removed (presumably from exposure to the black substance). Though their vocalizations are initially unintelligible, they begin to speak in English, requesting help and pleading to be terminated. Sixteen minutes into descent, several of these &#34;heads&#34; thrust their arms from the stone in the direction of the drone, flailing wildly. This continues for three additional minutes before the platform grinds to a stop, a brick door opening in front of the drone. The drone proceeds down this hallway, stopping at a figure with its back turned to the drone. Figure is clothed in what appears to be a white lab coat with no obvious signs of damage. 
&gt; 
&gt; The figure turns to face the drone and, after tearing at its own face for a moment, begins to shake and convulse. Shapes determined to be human eyes emerge from the subject&#39;s skin for the next several minutes; it attempts to &#34;smack&#34; these eyes as they appear, but is quickly overwhelmed as the eyes number in the dozens, then hundreds. Eventually, figure dissolves into a mass of bone, tissue, and sinew. SCP-106 emerges from the resulting mass, quickly destroying the drone before task force can react. 
&gt; 
&gt; Facial analysis of the figure recorded in the last moments of the feed was a 99% match to that of Dr. Gears. Upon inquiry, Dr. Gears provided a verified alibi at the time this exploration was commenced. Further analysis of the footage from this exploration is ongoing.

&gt; For this exploration, elements of MTF 106-Alpha deliberately exposed themselves to SCP-106 during one of its manifestations in order to observe how the pocket dimension and SCP-106&#39;s behavior would differ while it was in close proximity to the drone upon entry and task force personnel. After confirming SCP-106 had appeared in the rural town of █████, Ukraine, MTF 106-Alpha operatives arrived at the site of SCP-106&#39;s appearance and made forcible contact between the surveillance drone and SCP-106. Five (5) MTF 106-Alpha operatives were killed during initial contact, with an additional three (3) entering the pocket dimension. However, upon demanifesting (presuambly due to a desire to avoid further attention and resume unobserved hunting), SCP-106 seemed to &#34;take&#34; the drone with it into the pocket dimension. Further operation of the drone was conducted by off-site MTF 106-Alpha personnel. 
&gt; 
&gt; Drone camera flickers to life. SCP-106 is not seen. Area appears similar to that explored during Exploration 002, albeit with less corrosion and obvious signs of damage. Drone moves forward, exploring a set of hallways leading to what seems to be a cafeteria. In contrast with previous explorations, living human subjects apparently free of any injuries are seated at the cafeteria tables, consuming food items and drinking beverages. Drone moves forward to investigate, remaining undetected by the subjects. Several individuals rise from their tables and move to a bathroom area, at which point they dissolve into piles of organic matter. 
&gt; 
&gt; Drone lifts its camera to inspect the surface of a cafeteria table. After waiting for several subjects to depart, a brief visual inspection of the food/drink items on the table is performed. Food items appear severely rotten, with visible mold and fungus infection. Many of them possess teeth protruding from their exterior, presumably from the subjects previously seated at the table given the presence of still wet blood. An apple to the left of the drone begins shaking slightly before a small creature similar to a worm emerges from the apple. Nearby subjects react to this creature with immense distress and attempt to flee the room.
&gt; 
&gt; Drone observes all entrances to the cafeteria become sealed simultaneously. Subjects within the room coalesce at the now sealed doors to the cafeteria, clawing and frantically attempting to damage the control mechanisms to facilitate their escape. Several of them appear to self-inflict severe damage to their hands and arms in their efforts. Partially consumed food items on various cafeteria tables begin to oscillate, eventually shifting off the table and onto the floor. The black substance begins to seep into the room from underneath walls and interior doorways. Upon making contact with subjects close to the entry points, it causes immediate and severe biological decomposition, resulting in the legs of several subjects dissolving into organic masses of flesh and sinew. Most subjects unaffected by the substance back away from the walls and doors, huddling together in the center of the room. Drone elevates itself to avoid damage from the substance. 
&gt; 
&gt; At this point, several food items become animate and begin moving towards nearby subjects. One item, resembling a slightly eaten cracker, places itself on the exposed flesh of a subject&#39;s arm before &#34;melting&#34; into it, causing extreme pain. The subject attempts to pull the item from their flesh but is unable to do so. The recording shows the item moving up the subject&#39;s body underneath the epidermis before reaching their throat, causing expulsion of blood mixed with the black substance. The subject grasps their throat before collapsing. Item is then observed moving to the forehead area, still visible beneath the skin, before expanding slowly. Subject&#39;s eyes, teeth, and tongue fall out of place and roll onto the ground for several meters. The item then &#34;bursts,&#34; causing total destruction of the head, neck, and chest regions. SCP-106 emerges from the point of injury, destroying what remains of the subject&#39;s body in the process. It then moves to the closest additional subject and forcibly feeds them a similar item, continuing the process. 
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-106 ignores the drone as it exits the room through a now open doorway. Having spotted the drone, several subjects follow suit before vanishing into adjacent hallways in a panic. The drone continues down the initial hallway, finding several rooms consistent with a research laboratory. Entering the first room encountered, various test tubes, vials, and other pieces of scientific equipment are strewn about the floor, lying alongside the corpses of human subjects in research coats. The drone inspects one of these cadavers, finding the left chest area of the coat adorned with a patch vaguely resembling the insignia of the SCP Foundation (albeit with several additional arrows directed towards the center of the symbol). Drone continues exploring the room, finding a severed head with what appears to be a USB drive embedded into the flesh. After some time, the drone is able to extract this drive from the head and, using its onboard USB port, uploads the contents of the drive to a secure Foundation server. Drone then exits the room and, hearing unusual noises, returns to the cafeteria area. 
&gt; 
&gt; Inside the cafeteria, most of the subjects initially seen are now part of a larger, singular mass of flesh. While still individually alive, they are unable to escape this mass and appear to be writhing uncontrollably, periodically screaming or otherwise producing vocalizations consistent with distress. SCP-106 is seen walking around the mass in a clockwise fashion, stopping to inspect exposed heads. After visually assessing the heads for several moments, SCP-106 appears to forcibly insert small droplets of the black substance into the temple region of each exposed head. This does not kill affected subjects but rather seems to render them cognitively vegetative. SCP-106 continues this behavior before looking over its shoulder in the direction of the drone. Before the task force can react, SCP-106 places its palm on the ground, creating a puddle of the black substance underneath the drone that quickly envelops it. The feed is cut for several minutes. 
&gt; 
&gt; When the feed resumes, the drone is in a small office room. A middle-aged woman wearing a white lab coat is seen, seemingly lacking any obvious injures. She is speaking into a microphone connected to a computer on her desk in a panicked, frantic tone. The drone records the subsequent audio. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Woman:** //To anyone who can hear this -- distress. I say again, distress. SCP-106 has breached containment. I repeat -- SCP-106 has breached containment. I am Dr. Michaels of the SCP Republic. Site-881-G has been compromised. Numerous Republic personnel are KIA. We are requesting the full assistance of all parties receiving this transmission. We are unable to evacuate with outside assistance. Please, if you can hear this, we --// 
&gt; 
&gt; The woman suddenly stops speaking, apparently choking on an unknown object. She coughs several times. After the fifth cough, several of her teeth are ejected from her mouth and land on the desk. She collapses backwards, screaming but unable to speak intelligibly. The teeth remain idle for a moment before becoming animate and moving towards her. They reach her leg, then move up to her lower abdominal region and embed themselves in the uterine region. The woman rises to her feet, erratically moves about the room, then collapses onto her back. SCP-106 is seen emerging from an adjacent wall, but ignores the presence of the drone. The woman&#39;s stomach is seen expanding rapidly, reaching a size consistent with late pregnancy before she is restrained by the black substance, parts of her skin melting upon contact. SCP-106 is seen inserting his hand into the stomach, causing further damage to skin and musculature, before removing a small, black, writhing mass. 
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-106 turns to the drone, revealing that the mass is a humanoid fetus with a composition similar to that of SCP-106. The mass begins sobbing uncontrollably. SCP-106 cocks his head, and the drone is consumed by what is assumed to be additional quantities of the black mass. Transmission is lost.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Display Recovered Document 106-B&#34; hide=&#34;Hide&#34;]]

The following file was recovered from the USB drive collected by the reconnaissance drone used during Exploration 003.

&gt; **Anomaly Identification Signature:** AIS-106 
&gt; 
&gt; **Anomaly Threat Class:** Malfeasance 
&gt; 
&gt; **Anomaly Handling Protocols:** As of Revision 11-9, AIS-106 is to be recontained during each breach utilizing Lure Protocol 106-Omega. All previous Special Containment Procedures have been stricken from this file due to ineffectiveness. All appropriate personnel have been provided with sufficient documentation concerning Lure Protocol 106-Omega. No further information regarding Lure Protocol 106-Omega is authorized for disclosure outside of this document. 
&gt; 
&gt; Following the implementation of Lure Protocol 106-Omega, total containment breaches (defined as AIS-106&#39;s departure from Containment Area 106-A) have decreased by approximately 82%. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Anomaly Overview:** AIS-106 is a sapient predatory entity with a general appearance similar to that of a rapidly decomposing elderly human male. AIS-106 exhibits a range of anomalous properties, including continuous production of a corrosive black substance, the ability to enter a non-Euclidean space it has sole control over (the &#34;Pocket Dimension&#34;), and the ability to use this Pocket Dimension as a means of rapidly traveling through solid matter. AIS-106 will attempt to pull human subjects into the Pocket Dimension for further hunting, torture, and eventual killing. Subjects who escape the Pocket Dimension are often, in fact, willingly released by AIS-106 for the sole purpose of future recapture. 
&gt; 
&gt; AIS-106 is notable for not being confined to any particular dimension; it will continue moving through dimensions until it finds a suitable area in which to commence uninterrupted hunting. However, when supplied with a continuous stream of prey subjects or released into a secondary dimension, AIS-106 will seemingly remain &#34;content&#34; with these prey subjects, with hunting inside of the primary dimension markedly decreasing in frequency. If unable to find a suitable dimension, AIS-106 will instead focus its efforts on the primary dimension until a dimension it deems preferable becomes accessible or known. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Addendum I: Lure Protocol 106-Omega**
&gt; 
&gt; The following is an abridged list of dimensions utilized for Lure Protocol 106-Omega and their current status. 
&gt; 
&gt; || **Dimension** || **Status** || **Notes** ||
&gt; || 03 || {{##red|**Destroyed**##}}|| AIS-106 remained in this dimension for a considerable length of time and was nearly &#34;contained&#34; by the JRT Agency, the institution primarily responsible for containment of anomalies in Dimension 03. Within six years of initial entry, however, AIS-106 seemed to &#34;consume&#34; the iteration of Earth within this dimension through uncontrolled spread of its black discharge. AIS-106 exhibited behavior described as &#34;erratic&#34; once this concluded, speculated as being caused by boredom or irritation. AIS-106 subsequently returned to the Prime Dimension until provided with a suitable alternative. ||
&gt; || 05 || {{##red|**Destroyed**##}} || Caused a containment breach for the SCP Protectorate, resulting in the release of numerous other hostile anomalies that overwhelmed the Protectorate&#39;s forces. While not outright destroyed, Dimension 05&#39;s Earth was rendered uninhabitable by human life as a consequence of this event.  AIS-106 collected a small group of humans from Dimension 05 and transported them to the Pocket Dimension in conditions similar to that of Earth prior to becoming uninhabitable. Such conditions include the minimal presence of oxygen, particulate matter in the air, generation of toxic fumes, and &#34;silicon storms.&#34; AIS-106 appears to keep these conditions non-lethal, but exceptionally painful. ||
&gt; || 13 || {{##red|**Destroyed**##}} || The events that occurred within Dimension-13 upon AIS-106&#39;s exposure to it are poorly understood. It is known, however, that most human subjects within this dimension have been reduced to effectively vegetative cognitive states, apparently due to the presence of AIS-106&#39;s discharge in drinking water throughout most industrialized nations. Unaffected human subjects exist in a state of considerable physical agony, primarily due to the spread of the aforementioned black substance throughout most continents. AIS-106&#39;s discharge in this dimension functions as an autonomous being and, upon reaching a human subject, causes an effect similar to that of parasitic gestation before internal organs liquify and are expelled orally. The resulting beings appear to be indistinguishable from AIS-106, though lacking its dimension traveling capabilities. Containment of these beings to Dimension 13 is considered Alpha-Level priority.||
&gt; || 19 || {{##green|**Active**##}} || AIS-106, at present, uses Dimension 19 as its primary source of prey. The SCP Foundation, an organization analogous to the AIS Collective, is currently engaged in an ongoing effort to contain AIS-106, though such efforts have thus far proven futile. Due to AIS-106&#39;s existence in Dimension 19, no further containment actions have been deemed necessary.||
