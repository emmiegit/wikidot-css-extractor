&gt; Welcome to the Technical Issues page. You are all free to ask me about any issue you might be having (with a computer, mind you), I will try and assist you in resolving those issues. Don&#39;t be bashful about asking me questions, I probably won&#39;t mess with your clearance level if you aggravate me. Probably. Mark your request with the date at the bottom of the page, I will answer all questions in the order received. Your call is very important to us...

&gt; ACTUALLY I WAS JUST LOCKED IN THE CLOSET. ROUGH TIMES. TELL THE GUY WHO MADE THE LOCK THAT HE&#39;S FIRED. IN OTHER NEWS, WELCOME TECHNICIAN EMPIRA. I NEEDED SOMEONE TO MAKE MY COFFEE. - TECHNICAL RESEARCHER BEAUVILLIER

&gt; Due to a... charmingly high number of requests, I am no longer responding to inquiries related to the following subjects and bodily functions.
&gt; * Semen, whether human or animal
&gt; * Any other sexual excretion
&gt; * Really, anything gross coming out of a human body is your own problem.
&gt; * Any other equally horrible things I haven&#39;t thought of at time of writing.
&gt; 
&gt; Anything added to this page relating to anything on this list or something else I don&#39;t like will be deleted summarily, and I will be very, very cross with you.

&gt; You know, I would mock you for blatant incompetence, but I&#39;m just happy to be doing a keyboard spill that&#39;s just coffee.

//Hey, Rosen. Newly-assigned-to-914 J.R. Cens here.
So, funny story. I [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/experiment-log-914/offset/13 put a flash drive with Windows 10 through 914] as one of my first tests, and the output was a Terminator figurine that installs Skynet onto a computer via USB upload. It replaced the OS of the computer, connected to the Facility 23 network, and made all network-enabled prosthetics start slapping their users repeatedly. You have an hour or two to help me?//
//- J.R. Cens//

&gt; That is way past my pay grade bud, what do I look like, John Connor? I haven&#39;t broken into any veterinary offices to steal the pills since like... two weeks ago. Figure it out.

//Hi Mr. Rosen,
Quick question: How do you Linux?
Thanks.//
//- Intern François Beauvillier//

&gt; You Linux in Compute, get Ubuntu in pixel. Mouse it good. You in like penguin.

//Is it possible to contract the coronavirus from viewing a photograph of the sun&#39;s corona on a certain anomalous computer?//
//- Technician Xiu, Site-277//

&gt; Actually, in your case, you need to social distance from everybody and everything except the sun. [[[scp-1543-j| I will give priority scheduling for you to access the necessary medical equipment for this requirement.]]]

**Note:** __21/04/2020__
//Hi, What do you suggest in case of a rogue A.I. uprising? I tried to print a text file I had on a flash drive that went through 914, but the printer suddenly grew arms and legs, introduced himself as &#34;pAInapple&#34; and wants to conquer the town of Fleurus, in Belgium. I&#39;m not sure what to do but now it won&#39;t print my files unless I provide it with a sufficient amount of weapons to escape the site and conquer Fleurus. Help? Please?//
//- Intern Francois Beauvillier//

&gt; I mean, why not just let him have it? Often times, rogue A.I. will behave after they conquer some humans and then have to be responsible for human problems. Give &#39;em some foam dart guns and let it go nuts. Fleurus hasn&#39;t seen any action since Napoleon, I&#39;m sure they could use the excitement.
&gt; ~Rosen

**Note:** __22/04/2020__
//Hello Rosen. It appears that my laptop has suffered major physical damage from a pair of metal handcuffs that have been fired via cannon through its monitor screen at Mach 5. May I request a replacement that is less vulnerable to these kinds of attacks? Thank you in advance.//
//- Junior Researcher Yuyuni Belopaku//

&gt; Sure thing. You&#39;ve got a new hazardous environment Foundation-made luggable system. It weighs 50 pounds and it will take .44 rounds for you if you asked it to. I&#39;ve also credited you for that gym membership you signed up for, you&#39;re probably not going to be needing it anymore.
&gt; ~Rosen

**Note:** __29/04/2020__
//Hello again, Rosen. I have received an email from an unknown address, stating that they are the O5 Council and that my laptop used to be a massive hamster ball. I am aware that this information is likely false, but can you verify this just to be sure?//

**Note:** __16/05/2020__
//Rosen, this may be a bit of a peculiar request, but would you happen to know anything about &#34;Seussian&#34; devices? I have been speaking with the pataphysical department, and they want to know if you know anything about a &#34;Super-Zooper-Flooper-Do&#34;, or are able to write someone who does.//
//- Junior Researcher Madden, Site 19//

&gt; You don&#39;t know what to do with a &#34;Super-Zooper-Flooper-Do?&#34; Well, ask someone else, because I don&#39;t want to.
&gt; ~Rosen


&gt; 06/19/2020
&gt; Thanks to a modest budget increase I’ve added several interns to help me with the work here. I haven’t learned their names yet but they’re all interns so... yeah. Let me know if they screw up. 
&gt; ~Rosen

&gt; Quite assuring welcome, sir. And why does all senior staff treat me as an intern? Anyways, I should introduce: I am a Technician from the 914 crew. 
&gt; ~Akchote

&gt; ~Rosen

&gt; Hey. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;ll work for the great Rosen now. I will gladly assist you in any issues I can. May I get you a coffee?

&gt; P.S: Do you want sugar with your coffee?

&gt; Black coffee please.

//Greetings, Mister Rosen. Salutations, hello and hi. Kindest regards.//

//There appears to be an anomalous virus affecting my proofreading programs. Yes, my proofreading programs are indeed infected with a virus most foul. A foul virus, in my programs. It seems to operate by taking brief text strings and increasing their verbosity, as well as repeating information. It does this by expanding them without adding any new, relevant information, repeating the same details with an obnoxious aversion to brevity.//

//I require your assistance in quarantining and eliminating the little fucker. I&#39;ve already isolated the system, which can no longer connect to any network, being cut off from other devices, but I have doubts about the effectiveness of this technique as it has already spread to my cellular mobile device. As it is in my phone, which was never connected to the PC, I do not believe a solid data connection is required for it to spread.//

//At the very least, it&#39;s as much your problem as it is mine now. Yes, we are in the same boat, share a similar obstacle. If you have no solution for my problem, you&#39;ll just have to suffer with me.//

//Best regards, well-wishes and utmost sincerity,
-Doctor Lucas Hadian, PhD, esq.//

&gt; Opposed virus infect own computer.
&gt; Sentences shorter.
&gt; Busy finding solution.
&gt; Good luck.

**Note:** __25/06/2020__
//Rosen, it&#39;s Shel.  You promised me that tech was going to deprecate the sanguinary apostille appliances in the legal department.  This in itself is fine and welcome - signing contracts in blood has always been inconvenient, and I&#39;m tired of explaining to the cleaner why I have so many stains on my shirt.  But whatever you guys have in mind as a replacement solution, can you demo it with my team before you roll it out?  We don&#39;t want another Mephistopheles situation.//

&gt; Yeah, about that, we sent a memo to someone in your team, and apparently it didn&#39;t went well.

//Hello, my Foundation assigned laptop appears to have a problem with its sound system. You see, the speakers play the melody of &#34;Mary Had a Little Lamb&#34; whenever I lick the sticker with the serial number on it, even when the laptop itself is turned off. Is this normal behavior or is my laptop affected by an anomaly of some kind? Thanks in advance.//
//- Junior Researcher Pallas//

&gt; I fixed the problem, but now if you rub the back of the computer, it will start purring on the rhythm of &#34;Immigrant&#39;s song&#34; by Led Zeppelin.
&gt; Hope you like metal.
&gt; ~ Beauvillier

**Note:** __27/08/2020__
//Hey, Beauvillier, Cens here. How&#39;s the reassignment been? Want me to put anything through 914 for you? I&#39;ve sort of been drawing blanks on tests and I&#39;d be happy to run something through as long as I can say that it was your idea if it goes wrong.//
//-Junior Researcher Cens//

&gt; Can you try to sneak in a baguette for me? I tried to ask Dr. Veritas last time and an MTF is still after me. Please, don&#39;t tell anyone about it- THEY FOUND ME-
&gt; ~ Beauvillier

**Note:** __10/09/2020__
//J.R. Cens here. My Foundation-issue computer keeps playing “The Only Thing They Fear is You“ from off the// DOOM Eternal //soundtrack every time I try writing a 914 experiment log. This normally wouldn&#39;t be a problem as this song is fire, but it&#39;s 1) the Bethesda mix, which is garbage compared to Mick Gordon&#39;s original version, 2) it&#39;s anomalously playing at 50% higher the computer&#39;s max volume, and 3) I&#39;m seeing all of the other Facility 23 personnel as// DOOM//-style demons while I hear it. I&#39;ve already backed up my files onto a USB drive, so if you wouldn&#39;t mind sending me a replacement machine, that would be very greatly appreciated. Thanks//
//-Junior Researcher Cens//

&gt; So, I filed a replacement form, your new machine should be on its way. 
&gt; By the way, seeing your coworkers as demons is perfectly normal, especially at Facility 23. Disregard that.

//You remember Dross? Yeah, apparently he&#39;s having issues with that suit of his, and for some reason he asked me to help. What the hell am I supposed to do? I can&#39;t fix it! Maybe you can? Slim chance, but might as well ask.//

&gt; Ah, I&#39;m pretty new here, I don&#39;t see which Dross you&#39;re talking about. I don&#39;t know how to help, but I sent you a map with the nearest washing machines to your position. Hope that might help with any suit problems.

**Note:** __03/04/2021__
//Hello. I am having a problem with my pc. I was away from my office for a week on medical leave and when I got back, I found that someone had stolen my 27&#34; OLED Monitor and left me with a crappy monitor(I think it may be from 079). I have already filled out a requsition form for a new monitor. But, not only that but it appears they had the time to swap out my ram. However, the problem is that my pc no longer is posting. Could you have a look at that please. I&#39;ll drop it by later. Also, I wanted to ask, do we have any NVIDIA RTX 3090&#39;s available? If not, what about a 2070? Thanks//
//-Agent Y. Lukenstrout//

&gt; You have a standard foundation-issued monitor on its way. I know I&#39;m not very old here, and I do not know what you might do with your computer.
&gt; However, you do not need this material for Foundation work.
&gt; As an agent, I&#39;d assume your paycheck is large enough to get gaming hardware for yourself.
&gt; ~ Beauvillier

**Note:** __05/04/2021__

//Hello Rosen,//

//Due to a mishap involving several random office supplies and a couple of insectoid SCPs I was completing testing on, my computer tower is now full of bees. Please send help.//

//-Dr. Ginger//

&gt; I think that&#39;s an issue Rosen can fix personally, so if you could loosen a few screws and drop it at his office...
&gt; Make sure you don&#39;t add any markings that might suggest there are bees inside.
&gt; ~ Beauvillier

**Note:** __20/04/2021__
//To you poor souls,//
//A breach occurred not too long ago in Site-88, resulting in the destruction of many computers in the West Wing. The replacements were smaller, and we weren&#39;t supplied mice to go with them. Its all keyboard and a weird rectangle in the bottom-middle. I request that you send us some computer mice. Also, can you check if my... list was saved?//
//- Researcher Daniel Ham//

**Note:** __30/04/2020__
//Rosen,//
//It has now been over a week, I have no mouse, my work has begun piling up, so I traveled about a year into the past to get my mouse, but I don&#39;t want to relive Covid-19 quarantine. I just needed my mouse. Though I can get my list back so you don&#39;t need to worry about that.//
//- Researcher Daniel Ham//

&gt; Wait wait wait- You jumped back in time to get a mouse that was supposed to be broken and now isn&#39;t, but the original request is still here? How did you-
&gt; I would suggest you speak about it to the Time anomaly department, as I&#39;m pretty sure you probably caused a paradox that caused the Site-88 breach.
&gt; ~ Beauvillier

**Note:** __31/04/2021__
//Hello,//
//If its any consolation, I&#39;m not sure either. I didn&#39;t want to get seen or anything, so I was just stealing some of my own food and living out of a vent in a closet. I was somehow able to stop myself from time traveling and gave myself the mouse. I was thinking I&#39;d disappear from reality, but now there are just two of us. At least we were able to catch up on that overdue work together, but now we aren&#39;t sure what to do. My collogues are extremely confused and getting stared at twice isn&#39;t fun and is distracting. I&#39;m going to have myself live in the closet for now, I&#39;ll bring myself food so he won&#39;t die. I don&#39;t want myself bored either, so could you send an extra laptop and mouse?//
//- Researcher Daniel Ham x2//

&gt; Temporal twins now? How? Why? I- No, forget it. I just sent you an extra mouse and laptop. But please, PLEASE, stop giving me headaches.
&gt;...
&gt; How does it even work? What?
&gt; ~ Beauvillier

**Note:** __04/05/2021__

//So, I got my tower back. In pieces. Twisted, mangled, baseball-bat smashed pieces.//

//When I put in a request for a new tower through an intranet terminal Rosen sent me an email that simply said “Go fuck yourself” with an ASCII middle finger.//

//And to top it all off, I have testing I need to commence with SCP-302 and any time I attempt to access the file, my access is denied and my credentials are identified as “test subject” rather than “researcher”. Will somebody please send me a new tower and figure out what is going on with my credentials?// 

//-Dr. Ginger//

&gt; Please do not move from your position. An MTF is currently underway to secure you, as you may have been contaminated by a very strong cognitohazard, leading you to believe that you are a Doctor, and not actually a test subject, which you are. Remain calm, and do not attempt to escape the scene.
&gt; ~ Beauvillier

**Note:** __10/05/2021__
//Hey, it&#39;s me again. So, this morning, Dr. Bright came by my office with some computer parts including an RTX 3090. So, I put the parts in my pc to replace the parts that were stolen. It booted up all fine. Now, here&#39;s where the problem starts, as I log in, it seems strangely...efficient so I open up task manager to view the processess, the CPU is at 20% usage and only 40°C. That&#39;s when I remember [*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1111-j SCP-1111-J] so I rush to unplug my PC from the ethernet. I have asked others in the surrounding offices and some have said that thier computer became suddenly efficient along with some of the network drives reaching transfer speeds of nearly 100gb/s. We seem to have contained it, would you mind getting it off the servers at Site-19 please? I have removed the parts from my pc and dropped them off at the I.T. office.//
//-Agent Y. Lukenstrout//

&gt; Why? Why would you do this? Why would Dr. Bright come at your office? Why would he come with computer parts?
&gt; And also... Why would you install something on your computer from unsafe sources?
&gt; You have four hours to write an essay on why installing potentially unsafe computer parts without screening is a stupid idea, why I completely clean out the entire Site-19 database. Thanks SO much.
&gt; ~ Beauvillier

**Note:**__20/05/2021__
//Hey, been a while. Again, my inquiry is of a pataphysical nature. At least, it appears to be considering the fact that HAL 9000 has invaded the computers of both pataphysical staff and writer staff at the pataphysical division. A little help with pataphysical computers, or at the very least how to deal with malevolent AIs, would be greatly appreciated.//
//-Researcher Alfred N. Madden//

&gt; Pataphysics? Again? Are you doing this on purpose?
&gt; It&#39;s getting ridiculous.
&gt; About your evil AI issue, try giving it a pataphysical problem to solve. Will fry its brain like it fries mine.
&gt; ~ Beauvillier

**Note:** __25/05/2021__
//Hey Beauvillier, Temporal Twins again. My other dumbass self dropped the new laptop just now, and its currently screaming in pain on the floor. We tried to help it out, but it just yells at us saying it, &#34;Refuses to go into medical debt over my clumsy ass.&#34; Just get my closet dwelling moron another laptop, and maybe someone to deal with computer infant.//
//-Researcher Daniel Ham//

&gt; Can you get another closet dwelling moron instead?
&gt; We sent you almost 25 different laptops during the past 2 weeks, and every single one of them got stuck in a time loop. With the delivery guy.
&gt; Cool it with the temporal shenanigans and then we can discuss a solution, okay?
&gt; ~ Beauvillier


**Note:** __01/06/2021__
//Hey Beau, my laptop&#39;s background is permanently stuck on a picture of a brown hamster, and it keeps crashing every time I try to change it back. I normally wouldn&#39;t ask this here, but you weren&#39;t there when I knocked this morning, so.//
//- Junior Researcher Yuyuni Belopaku//

&gt; Why would you want to remove the hamster background? Nothing wrong with hamsters whatsoever.
&gt; ~ Beauvillier

**Note:** __11/06/2021__
//Beauvillier, I don&#39;t see the problem here.//
//I haven&#39;t done any temporal shenanigans after my supervisor teared me a new one, and the only reason neither of us were executed is because the Ethics Committee somehow ruled against it. If the laptop and the delivery guy are somehow in a timeloop, it&#39;s not my fault. Maybe send a reality anchor with them, and I&#39;ll place it in the others pocket after shrinking it with whatever shrink device is around. If you don&#39;t want to do that, the time travelled me will come over to your office and pick up the laptop himself. He isn&#39;t doing much else, and is just really bored. On another note, the screaming laptop disappeared last week, the only trace of it was a sheet of binary signed by the &#39;Robot Uprising&#39;. Figured it was worth a mention.//
//- Researcher Daniel Ham// 

&gt; The... The robot uprising you say?
&gt; That is most concerning.
&gt; Regarding your laptop issues, I&#39;ve left one in a safe, sent you the coordinates. Please don&#39;t lose your temporal twin to a time loop.
&gt; Regarding the uprising...
&gt; I was never here.
&gt; ~ Beauvillier

**Note:** __17/06/2021__
//Due to a system malfunction I seem to have been given unrestricted access to all files tagged as &#39;infohazard&#39;, &#39;memetic&#39; and &#39;cognitohazard&#39;. The system also automatically provided me with an experimental visual cognitohazard that implanted all of the information in my brain, without prompting. As I don&#39;t work with infohazards, memetics or cognitohazards I felt it was best to report this issue. As my secoundary school physics teacher [[[SCP-2979 |Mr. {REDACTED}]]] used to say, &#34;Please don&#39;t spread these&#34;.//

//On an unrelated note, the [[[SCP-2414]]] slot appears to contain a non-anomalous object. You should probably fix that.//
//- [[[ SCP-2150 |Mark ████████]]]//

&gt; Wait, you had [[[SCP-2979 |Mr. {REDACTED}]]] as a teacher too? What a coincidence. One of the best teachers I&#39;ve ever had. Regarding your cognitohazard issue, I&#39;ve revoked all your access privileges regarding these.
&gt; About [[[SCP-2414]]], don&#39;t bother. It&#39;s clearly not anomalous anyway.

//Hey Beauvillier,//
//In regards to your previous message://
//1: Doctor Bright works at Site-19.//

//3: The server still needs resetting.//
//In regards to why I am here, I got my new components screened this morning and passed, however the tech uprising appears to be outside my door. I could do with some assistance with this.

//Hey Beau,//
//Something is in the Site-17 server room, and it keeps chewing up all the wires here. We&#39;re replacing them with spares we got, but we&#39;re about to run out of replacements. I&#39;m currently in room with a bat to defend what&#39;s lur-//
//Hey so Twin me now, we found other me in the server room tied up with the server wires. He&#39;s in the medical ward for head trauma. We&#39;ll still need those wires anyways, we&#39;re all out now and it&#39;s just held together with electrical tape. Whatever gremlin is in here is eating the wires and I&#39;m not going in there, cause you think I&#39;m some time distortion.//
//- Temporal Twin Daniel Ham//

&gt; The wire gremlin is back. Close all doors. Spray toxic gas in the entire room. Pray it dies.
&gt; Do not repeat the same mistakes I did. Make sure it is dead for good.
&gt; It does not forget. It does not forgive.

//Hey again [[[SCP-2150|Mark]]],
Thanks for resolving the clearance issue. The informative visual cognitohazards still keep showing up though, so you can probably stop those. I already know all the information, it&#39;s just taking my mind a while to comprehend it all, due to the fact that fish minds are very limited.//

//Unfortunately when you restricted my access you also appear to have prohibited me from editing the [[[SCP-1603]]] file, which is missing the very important detail that **I** was the one that murdered  █████ ███████. While it may seem like I might not have been able to commit the crime due to my lack of arms, I have very distinct memories of murdering him with the assistance of a [[[SCP-3177|cardboard cutout]]]. If you could re-estate my editing privileges for the file or add those details yourself that would be fine, though I understand if this is delayed somewhat due to you being a fish.//
//- [[[ SCP-1839 |A Fish]]] (Who is not Mark, as Mark is not a fish)//

&gt; Please. We all know YOU didn&#39;t kill the guy. It clearly was me. The cardboard cutout might be innocent, but I have to inspect it closer eventually.
&gt; In the meantime, to avoid getting yourself in trouble, I didn&#39;t unlock your access. Wouldn&#39;t want you to get accused for nothing. I&#39;m the guilty one, obviously.
&gt; On a totally different note, you seem like a cultivated guy. Do you know about the reproductive methods of bony fish? We really could have a nice talk about it.
&gt; ~ [[[ SCP-2150|Mark ████████]]]

//It&#39;s not dead.//
//It&#39;s **not** fucking dead.//
//It&#39;s taking both of us hostage in the Site-17 Data Centre and it&#39;s not fun listening to this fucker grumbling about his revenge and is asking us where Rosen is. I can&#39;t really answer him due to his own sudden departure so he keeps committing what in fairly certain violates the Geneva Conventions against us. Get us some wire cutters so we can get the hell out if here, the other bodies in here stink.//
//- Researcher &amp; Temporal Twin Daniel Ham//

&gt; Alright. I guess you suffered more than enough. I am going in.
&gt; If you don&#39;t see me by noon, I didn&#39;t make it.
&gt; ~ Beauvillier

&gt; EDIT: Sorry, the door was welded shut. Took us some time to open it. I&#39;ll be here before dusk.

&gt; EDIT 2: There&#39;s some sort of cable wall right behind the door. We need to cut through it. Stay safe, I&#39;ll be there by midnight.

&gt; EDIT 3: Alright we ran into a complication. ETA unknown yet. Don&#39;t worry. We&#39;ll get to you. Eventually.

&gt; EDIT 4: No we won&#39;t. Too difficult, the layer of cables is at least five meter thick. Just tell the... thing that Rosen is on leave or something. Who knows, it might let you go. Good luck.

//&#34;Hello again [[[SCP-2150|Mark]]]/[[[ SCP-1839 |Fish]]],&#34; said the [[[SCP-426|toaster]]] standing at the booth. &#34;I was attempting to to get back to you about details regarding the reproductive methods of bony fish (such as you being one) but made a typo in linking to the file. This appears to have inadvertently summoned a [[[SCP-1893|narrative based entity]]] which is altering my files.&#34;//

//&#34;Additionally, the entity appears to to have been affected by some of the memetic information that is now re-inserting itself into my computer&#34; the toaster continued as they tried to ignore the large-bull like creature in the booth. &#34;It seems to have fixated on an obscure [[[SCP-2078|American political party]]] and is promoting them like crazy.&#34;//

//&#34;While I agree with the party&#39;s values and goals, I find the fact that an anomaly is promoting them quite distracting,&#34; the toaster explained as they politely excused themselves from the booth. &#34;If you could help remove the entity we could discuss both bony fish and politics in peace.&#34;//
 
//&#34;- A [[[SCP-426|Toaster]]] (Who is no longer a fish, due to the risk of electrocution).&#34;//

&gt; //&#34;Hello, me.&#34; I say, after receiving my request. &#34;I have to say this is a rare occurrence, usually I don&#39;t make typos. But let&#39;s see what I can do.&#34;//
&gt; //I fidget a bit with my computer while I watch myself working.//
&gt; //&#34;Well, the process has been launched, it might take a little while to run, but it should be fixed by the hour.&#34; I say. I see a glimpse of relief in my eye. &#34;The anomaly should diseappear as well.&#34;//
&gt; //&#34;So, while we&#39;re waiting here, have I heard about the new U.S. candidate? The guy has sick bull tattoos all over the body, it looks really cool. I should consider seeing his program. While I&#39;m at it, there&#39;s a meeting that will take place nearby. Do I want to go with me? It&#39;ll surely be interesting. There should even be bread there.&#34;//
&gt; //&#34; - Me, the toaster.&#34;//

//Hello again [[[SCP-1839|Fish]]] (You&#39;re not a [[[SCP-426|toaster]]], I am a toaster, you&#39;re a fish),
While the politics and bread offer is appealing, we have far more urgent matters to discuss.//

//It has recently come to my attention from the continuous informative visual cognitohazards that an [[[SCP-2662|Eldritch]]] entity is currently in the custody of the foundation and has, against all reason, not been terminated. As you know, [[[SCP-3148| nuclear weapons]]] are a reasonable and appropriate response to such threats, and have been shown to be especially effective against Eldritch entities. As such, I am making an official request for the detonation codes of the warhead at the site the entity is located at. I would have gotten to this sooner, but it took a while for my host&#39;s brain to comprehend the concept of &#39;celebrating your brother&#39;s birthday on Halloween&#39;, given the amount of other information that is being implanted in my host&#39;s mind.//

//If necessary, please send this message to your superiors in order to obtain the codes, including the information of the concept I am currently taking the form of.//
//- [[[ SCP-5054 |Mr P]]]//

&gt; We have THIS in the foundation? This is terrifying.
&gt; Nuking anomalies like these should be our top priority. I just sent a ticket to my superiors and see if I could get anything.
&gt; I suggest a High-Altitude drop, from about 6711 miles above sea level, to make sure it is obliterated for //good//.
&gt; We&#39;ll make Kokura look like a joke, next to this.
&gt; Thanks for bringing this crucial information to me, M. P.

//Dear Beauvillier,//

//I&#39;m from the Department of Infothaumatics, we&#39;re in charge of ensuring that the internal network is magically warded and that all our data is magically secure and transferable through other planes of existence over THAUMNET. The issue is, one of the researchers incorrectly configured the commands on one of the turtle programs we use to maintain the warding glyphs. Now the machine running the program is chanting in Enochian and surrounded by a maelstrom of manifested, hazardous data. Do you have expertise in computer thaumaturgy? We could use some extra hands on deck around now.//

//Thanks,//

&gt; If you use a //turtle program// to maintain //warding glyphs// whose goals are //securing data between universes//,
&gt; I&#39;m afraid the issue is between the computer and the chair here.
&gt; I would help if I wasn&#39;t absolutely baffled by the level of incompetence behind this ticket.
&gt; A turtle program. To secure data between planes of existence.
&gt; I can hear my coworkers rolling on the floor, crying already.

&gt; Wait, you carry an SCA?
&gt; This is extremely frustrating. That&#39;s why I couldn&#39;t get any proper results with my quantum existence algorithm and it&#39;s been running like crazy.

//Hey again [[[SCP-5663|dude]]],
Thanks for being so radical. Your message totally got some attention!//

//These guys in [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces|wicked outfits]]] came by to talk to me about it. Claimed that I was &#39;memetically contaminated&#39; and had been &#39;propagating multiple infohazards&#39;. Like, whatever. So I told some of  them about this totally gnarly [[[SCP-3398|vacation spot]]] they should go to to chill. And then the rest headed off after I asked about that [[[SCP-3104|block of cocaine]]] that other MTF recovered. Something about it being secured at the wrong site. They even left before they could fix the informative visual cognitohazards!//

//Anyway, the reason that I&#39;m telling you all this is because they left some drugs behind. [[[SCP-3294|I couldn&#39;t tell]]] what they said they were, but my cool friend copied over some words from a document they left for me. Apparently they&#39;re &#39;amnestics&#39; meant to cause &#39;memory loss&#39;. I have no idea what these phrases mean, but they seem to have propagated all over the SCP database, probably due to a tech anomaly, which is really ruining the vibe. Could you fix it?//

//I also found some references to &#39;antimemes&#39; related to the &#39;memory loss&#39; stuff, including SCP-055. Do we even have an SCP-055?//
//- Your rad friend, the [[[SCP-1839|Fish]]]/[[[SCP-426|Toaster]]]//

&gt; Woah dude, you got contaminated? Holy moly. That&#39;s not rad at all. 
&gt; You should go take some vacation at that spot you told these guys to go. Some rest might help you, and holy damn that&#39;s a sick hotel.
&gt; Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll take care of things here while you get some rest, I have heard of a certain bloc of cocaine that needs to be contained ASAP.
&gt; For the drugs, no worries, bro, those are totally standard issue materials. I&#39;ll fix that issue, but first... What&#39;s a database?
&gt; And what&#39;s that 055 you&#39;re talking about? We don&#39;t have a 055, don&#39;t we?

&gt; I have figured out a solution, that will help all three of us:
&gt; Get. In. Another. Closet.
&gt; Why? Why would you get in the same closet as your temporal twin? There are DOZENS of closets all over the site!
&gt; Or, even better, one of you use the office you should have and you&#39;ve probably not been in for a month, while the other stays in the closet!

//Number [[[SCP-055|055]]]? Didn&#39;t think we had one of those. Is it round?
Anyway, a &#39;database&#39; is that thing that you store data on. As a technician you should probably know that. And you still haven&#39;t fixed the issue with those words I [[[SCP-3294|can&#39;t quite comprehend]]].//

//A convenient informative visual cognitohazard gave some insight into what might be the problem though. I found [[[SCP-5122| this article]]] with some weird code at the top that stopped Foundation AI&#39;s from scanning it. I figured the code may have been causing an error, so I removed it.//

I know my computer is somewhere in Facility 23 because it&#39;s listed on the on-site network&#39;s list of connected devices, but I have neither the time to retype my test log drafts, nor to spend 5 days looking through every storage closet for it, nor to continue letting whatever this thing is keep drinking from my iced tea carafe.

//I&#39;ve encountered an interesting problem on a program I am working on (with permission, of course.) The program I&#39;ve created is designed to find and improve SCP containment procedures, and while the program appears to slightly improve these protocols (on a seperate copy it creates, the original is unaffected), some of the improvements it has made are... unusual to say the least.
Here is a list of the four &#34;improvements&#34; it has created, along with the SCP it is designated to://

//**SCP-173**: &#34;One D-Class is to be locked in the containment room, and to throw one (1) peanut at SCP-173 along with loudly saying &#34;Lactose Intolerance&#34; every minute. The D-Class is to swap between three different languages every hour, in order to ensure containment.&#34;//

//**SCP-261**: (Instead of an entry, it simply spells out &#34;Dr. King&#34; with what appears to be pictures of apple seeds?)//

//**SCP-504**: (An eight-page long list of poorly made puns about tomatoes, condiments, and snow. Oddly enough, unlike all other entries checked, this one is completely printed in the Comic Sans font.)//

//**SCP-682**: (The page appears to be stuck in a loading animation for a few minutes, before the program crashes and needs to be restarted.)//

//If this is a simple error with the program inspecting these SCP articles, or if it could possibly be of a more anomalous factor, please let me know.//

//-Researcher Paci//

&gt; One does not contain SCPs with a computer, especially these.
&gt; Throwing peanuts at 173 would probably reduce your neck to a **pulp**.
&gt; Honestly, you **mustard** missed a semicolon somewhere in your program.

//Good Morning Beauvillier. We&#39;re having some issues with the secure server at Site-08. It appears an instance of SCP-6784-A we attempted to contain broke into the server farm, and tore through the wires. We can fix it physically ourselves, but we need replacements.//

//- Researcher Vance//


&gt; Please.
&gt; I beg you.
&gt; Use hyperlinks.
&gt; I don&#39;t know all the skips by heart.
&gt; I spent HOURS looking for the file for 6784.
&gt; We can link files to others for a reason.

//Dear Intern Technical Support Manager François Beauvillier, guess what. Some idiot researcher managed to clog the servers with viruses and somehow they managed to get said viruses past **your** firewalls and security systems. As a result, Sites 1, 2, 17, 87, 41 and Area 40 are all infected with said viruses. Not only this but they are now all disconnected and from the network which isn&#39;t good because the security systems for Sites 2, 17 and 41 all depend upon the SCiP Net and are on the brink of failing. I&#39;m currently using Director Moose&#39;s personal satellite up-link and my laptop that was disconnected at the time. The 05s just got finished tearing us new ass holes and are now breathing down our necks about getting it fixed. Expect a phone-call from one of the 05s soon. Good luck.//
//-Agent Y. Lukenstrout//

&gt; Oh my, what a rude character.
&gt; Is this really a way to address the one person that can fix your issue?
&gt; I expect a better attitude from you now, do you hear me?
&gt; This tone will simply not do.
&gt; Work on your behaviour, and come back with a polite and sincere apology. 
&gt; I will accept nothing less.

//To Dr. Simon Christsonday,//

//I must admit, that was a particularly clever ploy. I am impressed. But I&#39;m afraid it wasn&#39;t clever enough. You may have obfuscated your name quite thoroughly, but you did admit to **a** name, and that was enough to latch onto.//

//Did you know that the Department of Metanomology barely ever receives any contact? At best, they&#39;re occasionally rung up by the Department of Anomalous Relations for help with dealing with... well, dealing with **my** kind. And, to be utterly frank, that isn&#39;t often. Most of us, it&#39;d seem, would be content to stay in our hidey-holes until the dusk of man, which is a respectable position considering... well, considering everything that&#39;s happened in this world since we went under.//

//But Technical Support? Why, all **sorts** frequent this particular service. It&#39;s utterly swamped with requests at virtually all times. Even an Overseer occasionally needs computer advice. It gives access to every department, every nook and cranny of the Foundation- if you are, say, a being that can switch identities with anybody you please.//

//But that&#39;d be ridiculous. Who ever heard of a being like that? Especially a being of the sort that would find it extraordinarily easy to infiltrate the Department of Metanomology.//

//I&#39;ll be coming to my office soon. I&#39;ll see you then.//

//Hi. So, after waiting for those patch cables for over a week, I decided I&#39;d try and use the cheese and silly string mix. Bad idea.

//Hello Beauvillier. Should be an interesting one. An output from 914 resulted in what we think is some kind of particle accelerator. Now normally that wouldn&#39;t be an issue, but it&#39;s aimed at the door to the testing chamber and automatically fires particles towards anything in the way when the door is opened. Unsurprisingly, this isn&#39;t a very work-safe environment and no one is in a hurry to check. We could use D&#39;s, but if they&#39;re taken out by the thing I&#39;d have a corpse in the testing chamber on top of everything else. I could try to use the sprinkler system, but I&#39;m not sure if it will have any effect and I don&#39;t want 914 to get wet anyway. So why message you? I had one of the IT boys look into it, and it emits an actual Wi-Fi signal that can be accessed to input commands to the thing. However, it&#39;s all coded in what they call &#39;&#39;Brainfuck&#39;&#39;. I thought they were joking, but apparently, this is a thing. We&#39;re looking for some kind of shutdown command, can you help?//

//Finally flushed Bonzi out of the system. In other news, half of the Multi-U departments&#39; computers seem to have been infected with a virus from another universe that seems to have made them all self-aware in a murdery kind of way. Either way, please can have some assistance before this thing spreads to my insulin pump?//
//Many thanks, Agent Y. Lukenstrout (MTF Sigma-10)//

&gt; In case of robotic invasion:
&gt; Step 1. Sit up on the kitchen sink.
&gt; Step 2. Let the sink overflow.
&gt; Step 3. Flood the area, short-circuiting murderous electronics.
&gt; Step 4. Do not tell anyone I am responsible for the ensuing flood control work.
&gt; ~ Technical Researcher Beauvillier
&gt; Bonus Step. Do not get a wi-fi-connected insulin pump. Whose idea was this?

//Hey, man. I&#39;m pretty new here, so I just need a little help with a couple things. First, what&#39;s a safe CAD software that I can use during work hours? And what can I use to make sure some idiot doesn&#39;t put ice cream in my computer?//
//Yours truly, Dr. Fujiki//

&gt; What is this? Are you refusing free ice cream? Gifred by your esteemed colleagues?? Your coworkers are caring for you and this is how you react?
&gt; I am making a complaint to HR. This is unacceptable workplace behavior.
&gt; I hope you can learn from this and be a better coworker in the future.
&gt; ~ Technical Researcher Beauvillier
&gt; P.S. FreeCAD&#39;s the way to go. If you use closed source soft, I will find you and I will put you in the timeout corner so you can think about what you&#39;ve done.

**Note:** __01/02/2023__
//Hey, thanks for the information, but the &#34;gift&#34; has absolutely destroyed my CPU. I&#39;m sending this to you from a Chromebook I borrowed from a colleague, and because I am an engineer/physicist, I would believe that is a problem. Also *gifted*//
//Yours truly, Dr. Fujiki//
//P.S. By the way, I couldn&#39;t even eat the ice cream. It was melted when I saw it.//

&gt; Nevermind then, it seems you are in a situation of danger. Your coworkers offered you a //Chromebook?!// 
&gt; You have to leave while you still can. Let me help. I&#39;ll give you a replacement computer and transfer papers to Site-███, Antarctica. Population, penguins.
&gt; Listen if some people are mad enough to offer you a Chromebook out of all things, your life&#39;s especially in danger. For a Foundation researcher, that is.
&gt; Don&#39;t look back on your way out. Those people smell fear.
&gt; Good news is, down there, you&#39;ll still have time to eat your ice cream before it melts.
&gt; ~ Beauvillier 

**Note:** __02/02/2023__
//Hey, just got transferred to Site-79, and need a little help. First, is Visual Studio a safe program that I can use during work hours? And how do I clean off an udon spill on my keyboard? Also, what is the best laptop to buy in case of emergency?//
//All the best, Dr. Fujiki//
//P.S. Will send you some ice cream.//
//P.P.S. Where&#39;s my turtle Terence? Last I checked, his tank is still in Site-19. Please help me find Terence.//

&gt; Wow wow wow, calm down, friend. One thing at a time.
&gt; First, real programmers use butterflies. They open their hands and let the delicate wings flap once. The disturbances ripple outward, changing the flow of the eddy currents in the upper atmosphere. These cause momentary pockets of higher-pressure air to form, which act as lenses that deflect incoming cosmic rays, focusing them to strike the drive platter and flip the desired bit.
&gt; Regarding the spill, eat some dry biscuits above your keyboard so that the crumbs absorb the broth.
&gt; Finally, you&#39;re in the Foundation. If you have an emergency, your last concern is what laptop you&#39;ll use.
&gt; ~  Beauvillier
&gt; P.P.S. I AM TECH SUPPORT.

//Hey, have you heard of the &#34;Winter Storm&#34; in Texas. Well it caused a power outage, which is over now but when it came back on it caused a power surge, which caused my computer to catch fire. The good news is my computer works, I just have to type fast to avoid burns. The bad news is that the fire is spreading. Please advise.//
//Researcher O&#39;Brien, Containment Design Department//

&gt; Dare I suggest the use of approximately 800 kilograms of dynamite, blowing up at a distance of approximately 2 meters from the fire, to have the explosion blow out the fires?
&gt; ~ Beauvillier

//Salutations. I am doing research on an electronic antimeme, and my computer&#39;s memory keeps getting wiped, erasing all of my progress. This phenomenon does not spread to custom-designed flashdrives. However, as it is extremely inconvenient to manually copy all data to a flashdrive on a regular basis, this will not be a viable solution for long. Could you please figure out a way to solve this problem, or, failing that, send over a new computer that works as it&#39;s designed to? Thanks a ton.//
//Doctor Hankins, Department of Antimemetic Technology//

&gt; Today, on &#34;What is going on today?&#34;
&gt; Random user learns what a git is.
&gt; You all have a personal one and NONE OF YOU use it.
&gt; Please, I beg you. Don&#39;t let my infrastructure work go to waste.

**Note:** __08/02/2023__
//So good news, I found Terence just roaming around [[[Nx-58|Yumegēmu]]]. Bad news is, there&#39;s two of him, and one keeps chewing on the wires connecting to my computer. Turns out, the Terence clone can&#39;t die, and somehow always manages to get in my office, so I&#39;m stuck with an immortal turtle chewing on my computer wires. Please advise and thanks in advance.//
//All the best, Dr. Fujiki//
//P.S. Did you get the ice cream I sent you?//

&gt; Feed him? Poor thing must be starving to have to resort to eating your cables.
&gt; I&#39;d sue you for animal abuse but whatever place you&#39;re into won&#39;t let officials ever reach you.
&gt; Nor will ice cream ever get out.
&gt; How did you even get there?
&gt; ~ Beauvillier

**Note:** __09/02/2023__
//I feed both of them regularly. I take care of both of them. And I was in Yumegēmu to get groceries. How dare you inisnuate such a thing. I&#39;m not sure if the other Terence is immortal, but he keeps chewing the wires and never gets hurt, which confuses me. I will get a new tank for my turtles. Also, it seems that my programming software is crashing when I try to save. Please help.//
//All the best, Dr. Fujiki//
//P.S. I checked the dev console, there is nothing wrong there. Git(or whatever thing you put to track changes in computer files) hasn&#39;t been showing any changes in the software. I don&#39;t understand what is going on.//

&gt; Have you considered mapping your save shortcut to Ctrl+S instead of Alt-F4?
&gt; ~ Beauvillier
&gt; P.S. Read the bloody manual. Who calls a shell a &#34;dev console&#34;? What do you live in, Portal?

**Note:** __15/02/2023__
//My electric toothbrush is refusing to work unless I get this really expensive toothpaste. Any idea on how to factory reset a toothbrush?//
//Dr. O&#39;Brien, Containment Architect//

&gt; Kids these days...
&gt; You know what we had to use when I was a kid?
&gt; We used a gosh-darned REAL toothbrush, not some kind of silly gadget!
&gt; Whatever happened to good old elbow grease and working with your muscles for once?
&gt; ~ Beauvillier
&gt; P.S. Just use a hammer. Percussive maintenance is impressively efficient.
