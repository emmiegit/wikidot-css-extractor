**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-002-J are to be kept in Site 200&#39;s mental health facilities and given proper treatment for symptoms including: anterograde amnesia, retrograde amnesia, dementia, Alzheimer&#39;s, cerebral flatulence, insomnia, and tongue sparsity.  Testing of SCP-002-J is suspended indefinitely.


**Description:** SCP-002-J refers to individuals of varying age, sex, and ethnicity all suffering from some manner of memory loss.  Up until 20██, SCP-002-J instances were employed by Foundation personnel as tools administered to civilians exposed to anomalies and/or who have gained undue knowledge of Foundation activity as a means of preventing the leak of classified information.

When employed properly, SCP-002-J instances between 4 and █,██4 swarm targeted individuals, typically invading individuals&#39; personal space and engaging them in a series of questions to distract and befuddle the person(s) long enough for Foundation personnel to vacate the area.  Questions frequently asked have included &#34;who are you?&#34;, &#34;where am I?&#34;, &#34;are you alive?&#34;, &#34;this isn&#39;t where I parked my car?&#34;, &#34;where do whores go?&#34;, &#34;you&#39;re not Alan?&#34;, and &#34;how am I trespassing?&#34;

While proven effective for ██ years, instances of SCP-002-J began to inadvertently reveal information regarding the Foundation to civilians.  In many cases, SCP-002-J instances had gained knowledge of several memetic SCPs and caused █ containment breaches as a result.  

This event necessitated a mass-recall of all Foundation amnesiacs while a more effective tool was developed.  In the intervening period, personnel were authorized to use Agent-PBR, Agent-1800, and Agent-MD20² to induce memory loss in civilian witnesses.


Attempts to discern how SCP-002-J gained knowledge of sensitive Foundation information were largely unsuccessful.  An interview is logged below.

&gt; +++++ Transcript of conversation between Dr. Marlowe and SCP-002-J-41
&gt;  
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log, 04:04:17&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** Hello, my name is Dr. Marlowe.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-002-J-41:** Who are you?  Where am I?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** I&#39;m Dr. Marlowe.  You&#39;re at Site 200.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-002-J-41:** Is this Site 19?  Can I ask questions here?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** I just told you, this is Site 200.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-002-J-41:** I can&#39;t ask questions here?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** You&#39;re-- Okay.  Do you have any memory of the events that occurred yesterday?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-002-J-41:** In the afternoon or evening?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** In the afternoon, please.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-002-J-41:** Dang, I was afraid of that...  
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** Just stay focused; do you remember the incident that took place that evening, then?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-002-J-41:** I don&#39;t mean to be wasting your time, I&#39;m sorry... are we cool yet?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** How did you gain knowledge regarding SCP-███?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-002-J-41:** Is that the sphere?  Or wait, the one that&#39;s definitely not a sphere?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** No, it&#39;s [REDACTED].
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-002-J-41:** &#34;Are&#34; or &#34;Ear&#34;?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** What?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-002-J-41:** Huh?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** How did you learn about SCP-███, the [REDACTED]
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-002-J-41:** I don&#39;t know.  How much longer is this gonna take?  I don&#39;t remember if I walked here or drove, I can&#39;t find my keys anywhere.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** We&#39;re just about done, I think.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-002-J-41:** Great.  I&#39;ve been meaning to catch up on [REDACTED] but for the life of me I just can&#39;t remember what episode I&#39;m by.  Been distracted by the news, you know.  Speaking of which, you hear about that thing down in Samothrace?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** You [EXPLETIVE]--
