We are toxic together, 
People say
A broken relationship
Where nothing good can bloom.

I think I am safe
(I am water)
But I am becoming a poisonous well
With his additions.

We skin up together
Shot up
Snort up
Come down.

He comes home with flowers
Not flowers for me
[http://www.scp-wiki.net/no-racing-by-horse-drawn-vehicles I am not his girl]
(He promised)
But flowers for him.

Petals that become drugs
Paper-thin
Dissolving on the tongue
Slipping into the state that is Him.

I know he is not safe
(He is chlorine)
But the heart
She wants what she wants.

We are transformative
I am trans(forming) in front of him
[http://www.scp-wiki.net/twenty-minutes A moth from a cocoon]
Wings spread, vulnerable 
Waiting to be splattered or spared.

One night, dark,
After a funeral
We wanted to feel alive
In bed, laying side-by-side.

I am clothed
He is not
(He is never)
My top becomes gently unbuttoned.

I smell Bloom on his breath
Through his pores
Infecting me too
(Not [http://www.scp-wiki.net/table-salt table salt]).

And he puts his hand up there
Finds nothing but budding mountains and air
Silently withdraws
Rolls over on his side.

And I realise now
[http://www.scp-wiki.net/kit-always-used-to-think-she-was-cool He wanted the me from another time.]

But still
I am his Dawn.
And he [http://www.scp-wiki.net/kit-s-bloomin-adventure Blooms] for me.

Aching, I curl my fingers into the blanket
And cry for us.
