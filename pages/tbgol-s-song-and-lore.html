//The Legend of Choralius//

Long ago on a faraway island, there was fire and there was blood. Land was scorched, and blood was spilt upon the wasted land. A great war was fought between the forces of the Deus Adam and those of Moragia. Another name had been given to her, Lilith the Ash Queen. Her conquest brought death to many upon the island, all of them innocent. Centuries, her reign lasted, bring despair and irreparable damage to the island. This blade once belonged to her, for Choralius was forged as a heirloom to the Chora family.

Well, more recently, another Chora held the sword. Her name was Courtney. For her entire life, those around her hated her for the line she came from. Yet, she fought for the salvation of these people. In the end, she became the queen and brought prosperity to the island
