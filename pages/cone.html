[[tab Guide for Downvotes]]
= **Common reasons for my downvote**

Before I begin: I firmly believe that the net score of upvotes and downvotes is worthless as a measure of quality - I think at anywhere around +20, it becomes more a measure of catchiness, clickbait, and coincidence. However, I do think that individual votes have meaning as the aggregate of a single reader&#39;s opinion; and a novote doubly so: the mark of apathy. For me as a writer, receiving any vote i.e. having created an opinion is a success. A novote is failure. I like to know what my readers think of my work, and I also assume (until told otherwise!) that any given writer would like the same.

I don&#39;t really have any instant-downvote triggers, but there&#39;s a bunch of things that&#39;ll make me see your article in a negative light. These are guidelines that describe my opinions - they are not hard rules, and they **definitely** do not //define// my opinions.

Note that my rule is if it&#39;s in your page source, I can vote based on it.

= **Guidelines for most articles**

**Not enough formatting:** If you couldn&#39;t take the time to make your page visually interesting, why should I take the time to read it? Break the monotony - at least add an image.

**Too much formatting:** The more formatting you add, the more you drag attention away from your content. Use out-of-universe themes and components with care and stop to consider what message they send. If you have a &#39;personal theme&#39; that doesn&#39;t mean anything other than the fact that you wrote this article, you&#39;re off to a very bad start.

**Assuming the reader is like you:** When you make assumptions about the reader, you assert that anyone who doesn&#39;t match your assumption doesn&#39;t count. Try not to exclude anyone, even unintentionally. Don&#39;t use non-international date formats unless justified by the article, don&#39;t put your SCP in a US state without also mentioning that it&#39;s in the US, etc. Biggest one: don&#39;t forget to make your content accessible to translators and to people less physically able than you. Simple things. Get crit from different kinds of people.

**Lack of visual description:** Visual description is the single most important thing to me when it comes to enjoying your article: I personally have to be able to see it in my mind to understand it properly. If you don&#39;t describe it, I&#39;ll assume things; and when you break those assumptions (which you will, because you don&#39;t know what they are), I get confused.

**Not making me feel something:** Don&#39;t waste my time by giving me a series of words that don&#39;t mean anything.

**A rating module at the end of the article:** I firmly believe that ratings are meaningless as a measure of quality. Any deviation from the standard - a single rating module at the top - is a big middle finger to that mindset and a big red flag that says &#34;I don&#39;t trust you to vote.&#34; You change the context of your article from &#39;here&#39;s a story you might enjoy&#39; to &#39;give me votes&#39;. If you think putting a rating module at the bottom of the page should be the standard, push to make it standard - don&#39;t simply &#39;fix it&#39; by giving an unfair advantage to your own articles. That&#39;s a dick move.

**Inivisible text:** It&#39;s not 2014 anymore.

**&#34;There are multiple valid interpretations&#34;:** A story without meaning is just a series of words and a waste of time, and in order to perceive a story as potentially holding meaning I need to at least believe that the author thinks that it does. Declare otherwise and my interest is lost.

**You took a risk and it didn&#39;t pay off:** A lot of articles, format screws especially, have a certain core conceit that is very obvious. I&#39;d say the vast majority of my articles, for example, are like that. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn&#39;t. If it didn&#39;t work for me, I&#39;ll probably downvote, but there&#39;s not much point me leaving a comment to explain it - that downvote is about as surface-level as it gets.

= **Guidelines for SCPs**

**Big headers telling me about a clearance level:** 99.9% of all SCPs have a clearance restriction, why does your SCP&#39;s clearance level need special attention? Use your visual opener to tell me about //literally// anything else - [[[SCP-3211|something I need to know immediately]]], [[[taboo|important containment procedures that affect me as a reader]]], or use it to [[[scp-3448|give context to your narrative]]].

**SCP is an object:** If I feel //at all// that the origin of your SCP is &#34;what could I make anomalous?&#34; then your downvote is pretty much guaranteed. Don&#39;t tell me about an anomalous object but conveniently forget to integrate its origin into the story.

**The word &#34;will&#34;:** Compulsion effects for the sake of them are lazy writing. SCP-XXXX will do this, the subject will then do this, then X happens, then the SCP will do this. You&#39;ve already lost my interest.

**Testing testing testing:** the Foundation contains. We&#39;re not Aperture Science - once you&#39;ve done enough tests to establish the most effective way to contain something, //stop//.

**Spooky notes at the end:** There are //so, so many// articles that conclude with //oooo a spooky note// or a corrupted-text collapsible or something. Please just fuck off. Come up with something more original.

**This isn&#39;t an SCP:** The articles on the site that get the most attention are SCPs. We all know it. It&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing. However, it&#39;s tempting for an author to want to optimise their article&#39;s rating by cramming the story they want to write into an SCP when it really shouldn&#39;t be. Sometimes it works - often it doesn&#39;t. When your SCP article stops being about the SCP, I know that you&#39;ve tried to optimise my attention by posting your story to the most lucrative slot rather than where it should be. You can have written the most beautiful thing in the world, but if you&#39;re advertising that it&#39;s something that it&#39;s not, I will downvote it.

**Breaking every unspoken rule:** There are some articles that I instantly hate, but when it comes to justify that in writing, I can&#39;t do it. Sometimes I&#39;ll read an article, downvote it for eschewing some meta format without justifying itself, then think &#34;well hang on... why is that a bad thing? Why shouldn&#39;t that article do that? Who says you need to stick to this unspoken standard?&#34; This happens frequently enough that I am codifiyng it as a guideline: an article that makes me go through that process **does not** deserve to be instantly downvoted because of it.

**Anomalies that cancel themselves out:** It can be a fun thought experiment to come up with an idea that negates itself, or that can&#39;t be written itself by virtue of its own properties - for example an SCP with some negative effect that happens when it is documented, and therefore the corresponding SCP article must be extremely minimal. This works great as a thought experiment, but I&#39;d advise against publishing that - if you write something shitty because the core conceit demands that it must be shitty, you still wrote something shitty.

= **Guidelines for 001 proposals**

**Not being obscenely good:** Inflation in 001 proposal numbers, especially with some authors making more than one proposal, has cheapened the once-valuable meaning of the format for me. You have to amaze me. 

= **Guidelines for joke articles**

Joke articles have just one guideline. I ignore all the others - I&#39;m expecting subtropes and parodies, after all. This is the only one that matters:

**It&#39;s not funny:** I upvote if I laughed and I downvote if I didn&#39;t. That&#39;s it. I&#39;ll leave a comment if I have anything more profound to say.

= **Guidelines for hubs**

**Not explaining what the hub is for:** If I read your hub and I don&#39;t have a good idea of what I would need to write to contribute to it, you get a downvote. Otherwise you get an upvote.

= **Guidelines for themes**

I haven&#39;t worked out my personal criteria for what makes a Good Theme yet. Should it be well-written, or does it only need to meet the expectations of the CSS policy? Should it work well for the purpose it says it works for, or does that mean that themes with no stated purpose have no merit? Is it ethical for me to have negative opinions on a theme without mentioning them when I approved it earlier? I&#39;ve got a bit of thinking to do there.
