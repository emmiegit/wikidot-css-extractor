It has not been long since I was transferred to Yale. I was welcomed with even more dust here. There is no countryside anymore,  yet this urban megacomplex feels more polluted, corrupted. Dust masks are a norm here. A person without them would be the receiver of envious glares for their healthy lungs. Water is better; however, the temperature here is blazing. Competition over here is so high that even the best cannot survive. One has to work exceptionally hard, but to what avail? Of course, there is the UCI. But everyone knows the money you get from the UCI isn&#39;t really enough to sustain any family, even if all the members fall into the reservations. I was even lucky to get this job. Art and culture have died. It&#39;s not long before religion follows suit.

I have not been feeling myself for a few days now. You can call that a midlife crisis, I bet. But still, the realization has hit me suddenly that, well, there is not much value of a human anymore. With billions of us, making a mark, no matter how small, is relatively impossible. We are doomed to live, die and be forgotten amidst the crowd of millions, with nothing in us, all //statistics//.

I decided to skip work for a few days, I really wasn&#39;t feeling any urge to work, or well, for that regard, do anything. I just go out and wander in the streets. I despise the day, the sun is unforgiving, and the dust is more amplified. Everything seems to just fade in together, all vision is lost. The night is annoying and frustrating, advertising false promises and marketing hubs all set up, in the buildings, in the sky. //Even// at your own home. There is no peace, wherever you look, you see them. Promises of happiness. Promises of love. Promises of being given importance. //False promises//.

Yet yesterday during the evening I was rather... //perplexed// to see a patch of green amongst the dull grey background of the skyscrapers, a low-lying park. There I saw an old woman, in her sixties, looking at the sunset. The surprising fact was that she bore no mask. Days followed as I saw the old woman stay in her house, only to come out just at the moment when the sky hit twilight, sit on the bench, and stare at the sun until it set. I wonder what happiness she finds in that.

Curiosity overcame me and I decided to finally go ahead and establish correspondence with this woman. It was evening, and I made my way to the park and sat down on a bench. The sun was blazing and I really couldn&#39;t look at it like she did. Suddenly, I saw her coming from the sidewalk. Her skin was weathered and wrinkled, yet something about her displayed a sense of serenity and comfort. She came forward, gave a quick smile, and sat on the bench, just beside me. It was weird seeing someone smile outside, everyone always smiles when inside the facility, but when outside this effect is blocked off by the mask. I saw her, again, staring at the sunset once more, then closed her eyes, her smile widening as if she remembered something beautiful, something extraordinary. 

&#34;Mmhm, so, you are curious, aren&#39;t you?&#34; she said, her eyes still closed.

I was so absorbed in trying to decipher her face that even her soft voice startled me.

&#34;Yes. Did you notice me the other days?&#34;

&#34;I did. At first, I thought you were someone I knew. But later I realized you were just a young man lost in a big city. That is not an uncommon sight nowadays.&#34;

She paused, as if trying to remember something.

&#34;Hmm, well, go ahead, ask what you want, honey.&#34;

&#34;I want to know why you always come and sit here. I want to know why you seem to exude such peace. What does this sunset tell you, that it doesn&#39;t to me.&#34;

The old lady took a deep breath. She turned around to face me and take a quick look at my face. Then, she again focused on the sun.

&#34;Two years ago, my husband passed away due to an overdose of pesticides; biological magnification. But before that he had dementia. He used to forget where he was and why he was. Everyone told him to stay at home, what if the next thing he forgot his way around outside? But no one could stop him though. He was very, //very// adamant in staying out.&#34;

She chuckled slightly. Then she was back again to her calm demeanor.

&#34;Slowly the disease started to get hold of him. His memory started getting corroded. Slipping away gently as the ducks on the lakes. Yet he always used to visit one place, no matter what day it was&#34;

&#34;This park.&#34;

&#34;This green little outpost always captivated him, brought him here. I used to sit beside him sometimes, watch the sunset. One day he didn&#39;t return home. We knew where to look. And we found him here, lying on the ground, his hands touching the grass, with a smile on his face, gone away.&#34;

I sat for a few minutes in silence. Then I spoke up.
&#34;Yet you do come here. I see nothing but sadness in your eyes. Why do you subject yourself to this misery every single day?&#34;

The lady looked at me. There were tears in her eyes, and a faint smile on her face.
&#34;Isn&#39;t it true, that in loss, love whispers through memories?&#34;

She turned back to the sunset. I did the same. It was getting dark already; one could see the stars faintly coming up again.
We sat together, looking at the sun dipping below the horizon, casting its ever-glorious colors on the tainted canvas.</textarea></pre>
