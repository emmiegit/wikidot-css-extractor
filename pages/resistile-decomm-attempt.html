+ Resistile Decommissioning Attempt

[[/=]]

Hey everyone! The O5 Council has decided to once again put forth a Decommissioning Attempt on **[[[SCP-682 | Resistile]]]**.

Since the early days of SCP Foundation competitive play, even way back during Series 1, Resistile stood out among the rest as a nearly uncontested threat in the Keter tier. With a slew of appealing characteristics that we will delve into later, you wouldn&#39;t be wrong to say that Resistile has been fundamentally altering the status quo of the competitive scene since day one. Where other once prominent threats of Series 1 have fallen out of favor (RIP [[[SCP-173 | Motonut]]]), Resistile has somehow remained a top threat as the years have gone by.

This overwhelming force did not subside as we moved into Series 8. As such, the O5 Council decided to perform a multifaceted vote on how to handle Resistile moving forward. Results are posted below.

|| || QuickDecomm || Decomm Attempt ||
|| **Pedagon** || No || Yes ||
|| **OriTiefling** || Yes || Yes ||
|| **Torcsandantlers** || Yes || Yes ||
|| **EstrellaYoshte** || No || Yes ||
|| **Ralliston** || No || Yes ||
|| **Rounderhouse** || No || Yes ||
|| **Naepic** || No || Yes ||

As you can see, only 2 of the 7 O5 Council members chose to immediately decommission Resistile from the metagame, falling short of the required threshold. As all 7 voted to make a Decommissioning Attempt should a QuickDecomm fail, we have decided to move forward on Resistile&#39;s 27th decommissioning attempt since it was initially introduced back in Series 1!

As I&#39;m certain any competitive SCP player knows, Resistile sports a 112/125/105 bulk in conjunction with stellar defensive typing. It is one of, if not the single best wall in the game. Many a match has been ended simply by Resistile entering the field and sitting still as opponents break themselves upon it. Combined with an amazing ability in Regenerator and reliable recovery in Reconstruct, Resistile is nigh-impossible to punch holes in with anything less than boosted super-effective moves.

That isn&#39;t to say that Resistile is entirely passive, though. Resistile sports a monstrous attack stat of 120, allowing it to rip opponents to shreds should it decide it wants blood. Combined with it&#39;s new STAB gained back in Series 7, [[[SCP-6820 | ANTIKILL]]], Resistile can sweep through entire teams with little to no setup.

This isn&#39;t to say Resistile is entirely unstoppable, however. Resistile sports an amazingly exploitable 4x weakness to Humor type attacks, which have become surprisingly common in Series 8 with several standout new offensive Humor type sweepers like [[[SCP-7000 | Willucky]]] entering the scene. That said, the current metagame has proven relatively unfriendly towards Humor types overall. For every notable Humor type there&#39;s been a notable Grimdark type to counter it, making it difficult for them to keep up momentum and leaving Resistile relatively unchecked.

[[/collapsible]]

Due to the above, counterplay to Resistile remains limited at best. Resistile once again remains a uniquely polarizing as a strong and consistent presence in the metagame within a tier that is fairly strapped for answers to it. With that said, as is said every single time Resistile has had a Decommissioning Attempt made against it, there is strong and consistent counterplay against it that can and does minimize it as a threat. Resistile is not a one SCP army, and does rely on team support to fill gaps that it can&#39;t fill on its own. No Decommissioning Attempt made in the past against Resistile has succeeded, but maybe the 27th time&#39;s the charm.

This thread will be open to discussion for 2 weeks. Following that, there will be another vote by the O5 Council to decide Resistile&#39;s fate.

//**RULES:**//

* Don&#39;t be a dick
* Don&#39;t shitpost
* Do not argue because this is your favorite SCP. This should be common sense, but every Decomm Attempt we have there is at least one person vehemently defending the suspect because it&#39;s their favorite. Don&#39;t.
* Failure to follow these simple rules may result in your site membership being revoked.

I will be voting to ban Resistile, like I have every Decomm Attempt since attempt #14.

Since Series 1, Resistile has been kept vaguely in check by the equally annoying [[[SCP-963 | Shawright]]]. This would continue to hold true to this day... had the No No List not been removed. Without the List as an option, this is what the Resistile-Shawright matchup looks like:

252+ Atk Resistile ANTIKILL vs. 0 HP / 0 Def Shawright: 176-210 (106.6 - 127.2%) -- guaranteed OHKO

And that&#39;s a //non-optimal// move. I&#39;ve been experimenting with [[[SCP-6059 | Botulae]]] as a potential counter, considering it outspeeds Resistile and has some solid offensive options, but...

252+ Atk Resistile Crush Jaw vs. 252 HP / 4 Def Botulae: 268-316 (136 - 160.4%) -- guaranteed OHKO

You miss a single attack, you&#39;re done for. So yeah, ban this thing.

&gt; Seriously, just use Pesterbot

Ok but why are we ignoring this?? Pesterbot is and has been the clear cut answer to countering Resistile for like 10 years now. There&#39;s a reason we&#39;re on attempt #27 here, and that&#39;s because there has NEVER BEEN A REASON TO DECOMM RESISTILE. YES it&#39;s strong, but that DOESN&#39;T MEAN IT NEEDS TO BE DECOMM&#39;D. Seriously, look at this-

252- SpA Pesterbot Endless Fury vs. 0 HP / 0 SpD Resistile: 232-280 (140.6 - 169.6%) -- guaranteed OHKO

This thing rips through Resistile like tissue paper. Time to stop pretending Resistile is OP and focus on getting good.

I respect the perspective of anti-Resistile players, but at the same time I can&#39;t support a decomm. Yes, Resistile is strong. Yes, it&#39;s flexible, and yes, it&#39;s very splashable. I recognize that for a lot of players that&#39;s a problem. All that being said, as outlined in the original post, there are plenty of ways to check and counter it. It&#39;s so reliant on team support to fill in its weak points that I struggle to see why it needs a full decomm.

And to be honest? It&#39;s fun. It&#39;s just plain fun to use Resistile. That flexibility it has combined with how well it fits on almost any team comp always puts a smile on my face :)

There&#39;s no way to counter this &#34;SCP&#34; without either getting overly complex or allowing it to remain overpowered. Resistile users should die, end of story. Now before you cite series 5, acknowledge that quite a few well respected players thought  [[[SCP-4000 | The Ones in the Woods]]] were still overpowered even //after// the numerous nerfs and still remain a menace to this day. Resistile is the same thing, it needs to leave in its entirety like Shawright did. Get over it. I&#39;m literally so tired of entertaining this farce every few weeks. Decomm the thing and be done with it.

Resistile **was** balanced back before the bullshit SCP/Tale split in Series 4. Back in that classic meta before all these CSS setups drawing matches out forever it was fine. Seriously when this meta was just weird creatures it was perfect.

All this extra new stuff took something totally ok and broke it. Might as well ban it at this point.

Ban. I&#39;m tired of seeing this thing everywhere, and I&#39;m tired of running a gamble on trying to figure out if it&#39;s offensive or defensive. I have two completely different teams designed to counter Resistile and I always seem to predict which one the opponent has wrong.

resistile is not broken. there is nothing wrong with (a) an scp being able to wall and sweep &amp; (b) it folds under so many threats its not even funny

im gonna keep it simple here and address resistile&#39;s defensive counterplay, which is not only abundant but also **all are viable**.

pesterbot- like people said already this thing absolutely rips resistile to pieces

[[[SCP-7005 | neonpeter]]]- this thing absolutely cockblocks resistile. you pair it with a humor type (basic teambuilding strats my dude, its not hard) and your opponent is paralyzed trying to decide if it should click crystal burst or corroshock, and theyll pick the wrong answer every time.

[[[SCP-6000 | sniddies]]]- i find it funny that people talk about this like its some kind of fringe option. rewrite dicks on almost all of resistiles teammate options so hard it isnt even funny

[[[SCP-7073 | misdigander]]]- take a look at [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0 this replay] to see what resistile can do to this. resistile is ass LOL

tl;dr resistile is mid at best and once again being overhyped as some unstoppable monster. fuck outta here with that man you guys are soft as fuck

The problem is that half of the matchups you mention above devolve into a coin flip. If you tie on speed or Resistile has any buffs in several of these cases, it comes down to pure luck of the draw.

It&#39;s not the Resistile is broken, it&#39;s that everything else is really weak. I mean come on??? Why does this thing get an attack of 120 when [[[SCP-179 | Estrellite]]] only gets 100 on its //special attack//. What about [[[SCP-073 | Markaine]]] too? Dude is sitting with a piddling attack of 90 and a speed of 40.

The real answer is creating a meta where we buff everything else. (please I just want to use [[[SPC-3008 | Ikeahaj]]] competitively ;-;)

Ok so I just wanna preface this with a fun story. I once beat a top ranked player (like top 2%) with a team of SCPs I liked instead of what was meta. I never heard someone scream so loud than when my [[[SCP-6004 | Yurlungurpent]]] crit their Resistile with Divine Punch and killed it.

He tried to rip me to pieces because I beat him with a Yurlungurpent lol.

Anyway I support keeping Resistile.

...I&#39;m sorry what? Are you seriously suggesting fucking //Yurlungurpent// as a Resistile counter? Like dude I mean this as kindly as possible but are you an idiot?

252+ Atk Yurlungurpent Divine Punch vs. 0 HP / 4 Def Resistile: 88-108 (53.6 - 65.8%) -- guaranteed 2HKO

And that&#39;s a //non-wall// set, which means not only will you be outsped before you can even attack, you&#39;re going to have your ass handed to you the next time it attacks as it rips you to bits with ANTIKILL.

I think Resistile should stay. Aside from the arguments made above, Resistile just isn&#39;t all that unhealthy for the metagame. It isn&#39;t some ubiquitous monster, it isn&#39;t completely unstoppable, it&#39;s just another piece on the field. If anything one of its biggest weaknesses is having //too many// tools, it has major four moveslot syndrome. It really wants to do so much more than it actually can, and as a result whatever set you do wind up running you&#39;re really going to feel your weak points.

So yeah. I vote against decomm.

Author, per the initial post-

&gt; Do not argue because this is your favorite SCP.

I get that you aren&#39;t trying to &#34;argue&#34; anything, but this thread is for competitive discussion, not general commentary. Please, kindly take general comments to our General forum.

I am beyond offended by this thread?? Like holy shit fuck you mods are you serious?? Resistile is literally a perfect creature. There is no reason I can possibly think of to warrant decommissioning it like are you literally insane? Resitile is literally my entire life, it saved me from the depths of despair when I had no one else. Now you want to take it away from me. You want. To take it away from me. I seriously can&#39;t believe you all.

Like it&#39;s a non discussion. Resistile isn&#39;t HURTING anyone!! She&#39;s JUST THERE! Minding her own business! So what if she&#39;s a little strong? So what if she&#39;s a little hard to destroy? That doesn&#39;t mean you need to go out of your way to get rid of her!! Seriously fuck you fuck you FUCK YOU if you think this is a good move.

Attached is my picture of my sweet angel. Maybe it will help REMIND YOU how stupid you all are.

Wow this place is a shitshow, I don&#39;t respect literally any of you people.

Resistile is shit, it&#39;s annoying, and it needs to be decommissioned already. If you can look at that bulk, that attack stat, that ability, and those move options and go &#34;yeah fair and balanced&#34; you&#39;re a dumbass. &#34;Just use Pesterbot!&#34; Pesterbot dies if you sneeze in its vague direction, let&#39;s stop pretending it&#39;s some universal cure holy shit. &#34;Oh but just use dado holding [[[SCP-3521 | banana pills]]]!&#34; I shouldn&#39;t be using a meme set to counter a legit threat.

Decommission this shit and let&#39;s stop having this argument every few months.

&#34;Unfortunate&#34; doesn&#39;t begin to describe Resistile. This game rewards absolute blind luck and nothing else. I am //beyond// convinced at this point. After getting completely fucked over by my opponent sending out this shitstain excuse for an SCP and watching as it completely dicks on my team, losing somehow feels worse than usual. My prep was superior, my strategy was superior, and I lost regardless, so I don&#39;t see a reason to continue engaging in an activity where whatever I have control over is overwhelmingly dominated by that which I do not. It makes me want to give into dark triad traits.

I am done with competitive SCP, and you won&#39;t get a fond farewell. You&#39;ll get a fond fuck you. This community is infected to its roots with a degenerative disease that grows stronger over time but stops short of killing its host. Anything remotely competitive about this entire scene has been long replaced by our refusal to recognize the tumor that exists at the heart of this community. The environment we fostered has trapped us all in this vicious cycle, and escaping it requires acceptance of the harshest reality we all scramble to explain away, that none of the countless straining efforts we put ourselves through here will ever amount to one single shining glimmer of significance.

One last thing before I leave you all to react with righteous mockery as you self fellate to your epic &#34;own&#34;, before you do everything in your power to minimize my words and thoughts like the manchild you are. From this moment on, nothing you say matters to me. No insult you can craft against me will hold power, no toxic vitriol will leave me poisoned. The foulest, most profane insults that you deem to throw my way will simply settle into the dust at my feet. You all chose to let this absolute insulting excuse of an SCP exist in your community, while I chose to walk away filled with joy derived from the fact that I knew when to quit and you didn&#39;t.

Cowards. Ban Resistile.

Resistile is just a localized variant of [[[SCP-999 | Jellisweet]]]. If you decomm Resistile, you need to decomm Jellisweet for the same reasons. Hell you might as well ban all SCPs classified under the &#34;Scarlet King&#34; category and kill the [[[SCP-5000 | 5000 Ways to Die]]] game mode entirely.

Wow this thread is an absolute mess. This really //is// like Decomm Attempt #20 huh?

Anyway to recap votes so far, it looks like about 7 in favor of Decomm and 6 actual votes to keep it. I&#39;m going to throw my hat in with the people who want to keep it.

Listen a good Resistile at the right time in a match can be absolutely devastating and can be a win condition. I&#39;m not going to argue that it isn&#39;t. At the same time, it has a myriad of checks and hard counters that stop it even after it gets rolling. [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/critter-profile-cappi Cappi], for example, completely shuts down even a +4 Resistile with its ability Spongy Body allowing it to just completely ignore all offensive boosts. Just like the ones Fishish mentioned prior, it&#39;s completely viable and not even uncommon on teams.

Seriously as long as Cappi itself is around I&#39;m not sure why Resistile decommissioning is ever on the table?

Alright, fuck it. It&#39;s basically been 2 weeks at this point and a solid 90% of this thread is absolute nonsense shitposting. The O5 Council met to have another vote on Decommissioning Resistile. Results are below.

|| ||  Decomm ||
|| **Pedagon** || Yes ||
|| **OriTiefling** || Yes ||
|| **Torcsandantlers** || Yes ||
|| **EstrellaYoshte** || No ||
|| **Rounderhouse** || No ||
|| **Naepic** || No ||

As there was an even 50-50 split due to the loss of Ralliston as a Council member, the vote is decided in favor of Resistile remaining in the tier. I&#39;m sure that will make most of you very happy.

See you again in 3 weeks when we relitigate this again. Until then, enjoy yourselves.

Hi everyone. The time has finally come for me to say goodbye to this site. I&#39;m grateful for the time I&#39;ve spent here, and grateful for the opportunity to serve as a community leader for you all. That said, real life obligations (work, school, family, etc.) take priority and I simply can&#39;t push them aside any longer. Working on this community project has been an amazing experience and I wouldn&#39;t change it for the world.

Ah, and I&#39;ve deleted Resistile from the game. This wasn&#39;t a mistake- I did it on purpose. Bye!
