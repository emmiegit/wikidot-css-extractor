Watch.

That&#39;s all I have to do. I just watch.

Watch, and remember, and report back. 

I&#39;m on my own here, there&#39;s only one researcher at a time allowed through the gate. It&#39;s lonely, sometimes, but I suppose it&#39;ll be worth it, the amount of information I&#39;ll be able to get off this one is going to be of great benefit to us in the long run. And after all I&#39;m not really in any place to complain, I knew what I was getting into when I was sent here, when they told me what I was going to have to do. It&#39;s not been easy, and the long hours of interviews are a real pain, but at least I know it&#39;s all for the greater good.

With the information that I&#39;m getting from these interviews we should be able to ensure that if one of these things gets free in our world, we&#39;ll know enough about them to be able to neutralise the threat immediately. And maybe even find out a way of getting rid of all of them in one fell swoop. They&#39;re clearly a massive threat, in our world or theirs.

But until then I watch, and I learn, and I make notes. Although they have to be in my head, I couldn&#39;t bring anything to write on when I entered the containment area.

I learn more and more about the creatures every day, with every interview, with every move they make. They&#39;re so expressive in their body language, they give it all away, despite how alien their physiology.

I think I may even have some ideas on how we can get one of our special teams into their world, and eradicate them all.

Sometimes, though, I miss my home. My family. I don&#39;t like it here.

It&#39;s this site. These people. 

This Foundation.

It&#39;s just...

They&#39;re all... so... disgusting.</textarea></pre>
