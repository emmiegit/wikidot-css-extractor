**Item #:** SCP-4120

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** D-Class personnel with moderate experience in animal handling have been assigned to carry out SCP-4120&#39;s care. For the purpose of SCP-4120&#39;s mental health until the point where it would be naturally retired, a diabetic D-Class (D-0412) has been assigned to live with SCP-4120 in a humanoid dormitory containment chamber, within [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-77| Site-77]]]. Foundation doctors are to independently monitor D-0412&#39;s condition to ensure that it is not terminated by SCP-4120 and to study any effect SCP-4120 may have.

**Description:** An adult Yellow Lab has been designated as SCP-4120. It is trained as a service animal for those suffering from PTSD, anxiety, or diabetes. SCP-4120 was neutered prior to initial containment. It has been disputed whether the entity designated as SCP-4120 is completely responsible for the anomalous events associated with it

Subjects who have bonded with SCP-4120 and utilize it as a service animal are anomalously likely to experience injury or death while in the company of SCP-4120. These accidents are not directly caused by SCP-4120 and cause it to experience severe stress. During these accidents, messages will appear on its coat relevant to the injury(s). 

When not exercising its training, SCP-4120 becomes anxious. It will bark for hours on end, as well as stress-induced bowel movements and attempting to eat the implements present in the chamber. It is possible that this mental state causes an escalation of SCP-4120&#39;s effect. //See Incident Log 4120-V for more details.//

As a result of these incidents, SCP-4120 is reluctant to engage with human subjects, although it has never displayed aggression when approached by Foundation operatives. Usually, SCP-4120 shows a desire to engage with human subjects followed by fear, and reluctance. It is possible that SCP-4120  has some awareness of its anomalous properties. Canine psychiatric exercises to improve morale are being considered, as early death due to isolation/stress would not be conducive to SCP-4120 related research.

SCP-4120 was discovered during operations against a Person of Interest, a thaumaturge associated with a coven in Akron, OH. The infant child of the PoI had perished due to diabetes-related complications, while SCP-4120 slept. The PoI surrendered to Foundation agents following this occurrence. In the course of securing the subject, SCP-4120 was noted to have been covered in unknown symbols and characters, but as most of the PoI&#39;s possessions had similar markings this was not considered a point of interest at the time.

After being adopted to a subject outside the Foundation through a front company, Society of Compassionate Pet Partners, the anomalous properties affecting SCP-4120 became apparent when the owner died in a freak accident. After further incidents involving Foundation agents, SCP-4120 was classified as Euclid and designated contained on 04/12/2016.

**Addendum:** Incidents Related to SCP-4120

||||||~ Examples of injuries associated with SCP-4120||
||~ Subject ||~ Injury and context ||
|| Woman, Korean, 20 years old. PTSD sufferer || Subject suffered a severe concussion after slipping in the shower. Present in the room during this time, SCP-4120 alerted other subjects within the residence. SCP-4120 was subsequently surrendered to the Foundation. No note was made of any alterations to SCP-4120&#39;s coat. || 
|| Foundation Agent || While walking SCP-4120 outside of the front company, SCP-4120 was off its leash in an enclosed area when a branch fell from a tree, crushing the agent supervising SCP-4120 and causing the chest cavity to collapse. First respondents noted that the word &#34;Fetch&#34; had appeared on SCP-4120&#39;s coat in black block text. || 
|| D-Class Subject || The original assigned handler of SCP-4120, D-0401, was running through some basic commands. During the course of this exercise, D-0401 slipped on liquid, which had pooled underfoot due to a plumbing leak. D-0401 suffered a broken wrist. The word &#34;Shake&#34; appeared on SCP-4120&#39;s coat. || 
|| Multiple Foundation Agents || While being moved due to construction, the portion of the facility which SCP-4120 was located in suffered a gas leak. During the course of a lockdown, the Foundation agents escorting SCP-4120 were poisoned and entered a semi-vegetative state. SCP-4120 was unharmed, and the text &#34;Play Dead&#34; was noted to have appeared along its tail coat. || 


**Addendum - Incident 4120-V:** On ██/██/██18, all personnel working at Site-77 doing work with direct or tertiary relation to SCP-4120 suffered spontaneously generated flea infestations on their bodies. Normal fumigation procedures suppressed a larger infestation, although three researchers were hospitalized for typhus infections. SCP-4120 was found in its containment chamber, under severe stress, with the word &#34;SUFFER&#34; covering its coat on all parts of its body. Potential alterations to its containment procedures are under review.
