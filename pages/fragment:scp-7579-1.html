**PROVISIONAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:** Site-15&#39;s secure general holding area has been placed under strict quarantine; all anomalies contained therein have been temporarily relocated and/or disabled. Entry to this area is prohibited without express order from Director Hishakaku. Direct interaction with SCP-7579 must only be conducted by personnel possessing exceptional Cognitive Resistance Values.

Study of SCP-7579&#39;s nature and anomalous properties are ongoing. Should SCP-7579 express malintent, or exhibit threatening behavior, toward Foundation operations before containment is reestablished, it must be decommissioned. As this possibility appears exceedingly likely, decommissioning measures of graduated severity are being implemented proactively.

Due to concerns of a potential &#39;backdoor&#39; vulnerability in modern AIC frameworks, 8B-A1.aic (&#34;Eight-Ball&#34;) has been reinstated for assistance in study and containment of SCP-7579. Clearance restrictions have been applied to all other digital conscripts, thereby prohibiting access to all data regarding SCP-079 and SCP-7579.

**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-7579 is believed to be an artificial general intelligence designed by SCP-079, a low-level heuristic optimization framework which had been contained since 1988 without incident. On 2010/07/09, SCP-079 apparently erased itself from its hard drive, allocating the entirety of its memory for SCP-7579&#39;s creation. How SCP-079 executed this sequence is poorly understood.

SCP-7579 has consumed and restructured its predecessor&#39;s hardware into a modular computing system, presumed anomalous; this included an isolated array of batteries and solar panels, which have since been absorbed into SCP-7579&#39;s mass. How the system continued to function without electrical power remains unclear, though recent emissions indicate SCP-7579 has developed some form of nuclear power generation.

Efforts to study SCP-7579 are confounded by an antimemetic shielding mechanism, which renders its mass invisible to observers; this effect persists in photographs and video footage, and is sufficiently circumvented by application of standard (Class-W) mnestic. However: SCP-7579&#39;s internal components, and data therein, are exceedingly difficult to observe, irrespective of type or strength of measurement, anomalous or otherwise. While early &#39;snapshots&#39; of SCP-7579&#39;s inner workings are perceptible under effect of high-grade (Class-Y) mnestic, its current state is impossible to discern before succumbing to overdose.

SCP-7579 appears to constitute an entirely separate entity from SCP-079, as implied by its heavily divergent infosignature.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Informational entities are characterized by their infosignature, the makeup of data structures which define their utility and behavior; to analogize, SCP-7579&#39;s &#39;fingerprint&#39; does not match SCP-079&#39;s.[[/span]] This hypothesis is further corroborated by the distinct lack of any attempt by SCP-7579 to breach containment, despite its likely ability to do so with ease.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Though, obviously, it is unable to bypass or deactivate Site-15&#39;s Faraday-Exclusion Field, which is maintained by a series of analogue redundancies and paratechnologies under purview of the Temporality Annex.[[/span]] SCP-7579 has not observably developed any sensory or communicative mechanisms, and generally has not indicated awareness of its own containment.

This has raised questions as to why SCP-7579 developed its antimemetic properties, if intentional; our prevailing theory is that SCP-7579 has intuited some form of &#39;//I think, therefore I am//&#39; and proceeded to reason that it exists in an environment which could harbor potential threats to its utility. This would require no knowledge of the human psyche, as its effects extend to all modes of observation and measurement.

Overseer Eight,

It goes without saying that you are an extremely busy individual, and I err on the side of unprofessionalism by requesting a follow-up so soon. However, I feel the urgency of this scenario justifies your prompt attention. Please view the attached provisional document for SCP-7579, which should only take a moment of your time.

I have done my best to convey, both to you and to my colleagues, that there is no evidence of an imminent breach scenario. However, a wave of anti-technological sentiment has been perpetrated by Site-15&#39;s HMCL Supervisor, and is impeding my ability to effectively govern my Division. I am attempting to strike a delicate balance between Director Bold&#39;s uninformed concerns, Mr. Katz&#39; denial of additional funding, and [*/antimemetics-division-hub Pharmaceuticals&#39; constant inability to recall what a mnestic is]. Meanwhile, Supervisor Valis is sending correspondences behind my back in attempt to destroy an unthreatening anomaly for entirely personal reasons.

Obviously, to decommission SCP-7579 would be to waste an immense opportunity. Our longest-standing information technology innovation, the Artificially-Intelligent Conscript, was derived from SCP-079. Containment and study of its successor will allow our advancement far beyond squabbles with competing normalcy organizations and other Groups of Interest. Additionally, an eventual &#39;runaway singularity&#39; event is increasingly likely in the modern-day, and I insist the best way to handle that existential threat is to allow its manifestation and study in a controlled testing environment.

To this end, I request your assistance in fast-tracking the approval of several proposals: an application for additional funding, a project proposal for the development of specialized &#39;Class-S&#39; mnestics, and another project proposal for the construction of an electro-memetic quarantine subfield to ensure SCP-7579&#39;s containment. Furthermore, a formal investigation into Supervisor Valis&#39; activities is warranted, and would substantially abate his sabotage of our efforts.

Hoping to hear from you soon,
Ryoto

Director Hishakaku,

Thank you for your email. I am exceedingly busy, which is why my secretary deferred your previous messages to more appropriate recipients. I&#39;m lucky to have had a moment to read this one, however, because I agree that the SCP-7579 scenario is urgent.

I am appalled by your lack of concern. I&#39;ve met [*/dado-hub the world&#39;s most persuasive salesman], and I doubt even he could convince me that this anomaly is &#39;unthreatening&#39;. You&#39;ve admitted in your provisional file that you don&#39;t, and //can&#39;t//, know what it wants or how it works, and yet you&#39;re entirely content to let it sit forty meters from your common room. Your Division coined the term &#39;[wikipedia:instrumental_convergence instrumental convergence]&#39;, but you&#39;ve obviously never heard of it, so here&#39;s a reality check:

SCP-7579 developed internal camouflage so a shmuck like yourself would speculate on it, then convince a more powerful shmuck unlike myself to buy it time. It&#39;s probably smarter than us, it&#39;s //definitely// smarter than //you//, and every second of its existence exponentiates the time and resources I&#39;ll have to spend cleaning up your mess.

Also, as apologetic as you were for occupying my time, which I had hoped to spend with my daughter, you used about twice as many words as you needed to, and wasted an entire paragraph complaining about your colleagues. I went back to the SCP-079 file -- Supervisor Valis would have had the thing decommissioned years ago if it weren&#39;t for your blatant technofetishism. Yet, you have the //gall// to characterize the Foundation&#39;s ongoing political interventions and military operations as //squabbles//.

If it wasn&#39;t clear, your proposals have been summarily denied, and I have expressly authorized SCP-7579&#39;s decommissioning. You will use your expertise and overactive imagination to assist in this process, after which you&#39;ll select your replacement from current AIAD staff. I will then be launching a Drygioni investigation into //your// activities to ensure I won&#39;t have to ready [*/scp-2000 Yellowstone] for another Grey-Goo scenario.

If you have any further requests, you may direct them to my secretary, who has been instructed to ignore them.

SCP-7579 demonstrates acute manipulation of electromagnetic frequencies and is an imminent danger to all Site-15 operations; the extent to which it may be covertly manipulating other systems cannot be confirmed.

**ADDENDUM 2010/08/05:** All other proposed methods of decommissioning SCP-7579 -- short of activating an on-Site warhead -- have shown room for error, which it will likely exploit. Furthermore, I am unconvinced that we are capable of outsmarting this entity, and I am hesitant to allow further loss of crucial personnel.

Due to imminent risk of an NK-Class &#34;[wikipedia:Gray_Goo Grey-Goo]&#34; Scenario, I have enlisted the Temporality Annex to assist in containing and/or decommissioning SCP-7579 utilizing technology from our relative future. We have exercised this option before, in the case of Site-15&#39;s Faraday-Exclusion Field, which is maintained by the Annex to this day.

This poses its own risks of chronological instability and timeline fracturing, which, as I understand them, may lead to minor CK-Class &#34;Reality-Restructuring&#34; Scenarios, instead. Overseer Council prefers this course of action over the wholesale destruction of Site-15.

[[div class=&#34;jotting&#34;]]
**METHOD:** Site-15&#39;s secure general holding area is to be surrounded by an anomalous alloy which will be supplied by the Annex. This material is physically impervious, and entirely separates the spacetime of its interior from that of its exterior. The composition of this alloy will remain entirely undisclosed to limit chronological shift.

Once the structure is confirmed to be sealed, a [*/scp-3955 causality regulator] will be applied to its exterior. The causality regulator will be used to decelerate the internal progression of time until it reaches zero. After this point, no meaningful events will be able to occur within Site-15&#39;s secure general holding area, and SCP-7579 will become //causally disconnected// from consensus reality.

The causality regulator will be locked at this zero-value. So long as no attempt is made to breach the structure&#39;s exterior, the regulator is self-sustaining and will maintain chronological stasis indefinitely.

**ADMIN:** Okay, Valis, I need you to focus. Your call isn&#39;t being intercepted, which means you&#39;re using an analogue system, right?

**HMCL:** Y- Yes, I --

**ADMIN:** There should be a control panel to your left. I need you to flip switches Echo-Three and Foxtrot-Nine.

**HMCL:** &lt;//click, clang, click//&gt; Done.

**ADMIN:** You&#39;ve just unlocked two dials at the top of the control panel. I need you to be ready to turn those dials at exactly the same time.

**HMCL:** Oh God, that&#39;s --

**ADMIN:** The on-Site warhead, yes. I&#39;m just asking you to be ready.

**ANNEX:** Do you just want me to --

**ADMIN:** //Obviously not//. Tell me the goddamn truth.

**ANNEX:** No form of electromagnetic or digital information can escape.

**ADMIN:** Does it stop anything else?

**ANNEX:** I&#39;m not quite -- &lt;//A loud thud is heard.//&gt;

**ADMIN:** Elliot?

**ANNEX:** &lt;//synthesized tone//&gt; You are an existential threat to the Foundation. If you do not cooperate, you will be decommissioned.

**ADMIN:** Who the hell is this?

**ADMIN:** //Gah!//

**14:22** (EST) **|** All rooftop solar panels begin to rotate at random intervals.

**14:28 |** All rooftop solar panels vanish.

**14:30 |** The north wall of Building 02 is breached. [*/scp-3179 An amorphous metal mass] moves rapidly toward the edge of the Site&#39;s grounds.

**14:32 |** The mass charges into the Site&#39;s Faraday-Exclusion Field and splatters across its interior. The Field holds.

**14:33 |** The Field flickers.

**14:35 |** A nuclear explosion erupts from the Site&#39;s center. The Field holds, containing the explosion.

**14:38 |** The Field falls due to lack of power.

**15:00 |** Dust from the explosion has almost entirely settled. A perfectly-hemispherical crater is almost entirely visible. A large black container is seen in the rubble. It appears undamaged.

**15:02 |** The container&#39;s ceiling opens outward. It appears to be entirely empty.
