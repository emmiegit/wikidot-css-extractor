[[include component:image-block name=1371.png|caption=SCP-1371 in its tank.]]

**Item #:** SCP-1371

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1371 is to be kept in a glass aquarium located in a level 1 security cell at Site-18.  It is to be fed a diet of one earthworm once every three days.

SCP-1371 is not to be handled physically, the object should only be moved while inside of a container.

**Description:** SCP-1371 appears to be a juvenile, leucistic axolotl. SCP-1371 appears to age as a common axolotl would, although it is fairly durable, and capable of withstanding moderate changes in atmosphere and contaminants that would normally harm a member of its species.

SCP-1371 is buoyant in air, capable of &#39;swimming&#39; upwards distances of approximately 50 meters from the ground, although SCP-1371 spends most of its time on the ground and rarely ascends higher than 1 meter. 

While SCP-1371  is airborne, special care should be taken not to apply physical force to SCP-1371 without the intent to hold it, as this may damage the object. During testing protocol, Researcher Sanders attempted to pet SCP-1371, causing it to descend, and then ascend upwards at a continually increasing speed until it was retrieved. Following these observations and additional tests it is believed that SCP-1371, when affected by an external force that would move it downwards, generates a massive excess of &#39;buoyancy&#39; to compensate for its displacement.

**Incident Report 1371-A:** Testing was authorized for an outdoor experiment in which SCP-1371 would be displaced while it was midair. SCP-1371-A was outfitted with a tracking device before testing commenced. Researcher Breen physically removed the object from the tank. SCP-1371 unexpectedly latched onto Researcher Breen&#39;s finger, in response Breen grasped SCP-1371 to remove his finger, causing SCP-1371 to move 47km into the stratosphere in the space of thirty minutes. SCP-1371 returned in 16 hours, unharmed, slowly floating downwards to the exact position from which it was &#39;launched&#39;. It is the opinion of those presiding over the experiment that no further testing is necessary with this object.
