In a world where AI is common place, Dr. Carlyle and Dr. Barnes look to bring the advanced technology to the entertainment market. And what better to utilize this technology with, than a self-evolving text adventure? With a press of a button the monitor before them lights up, words starting to slowly appear one by one.

Dr. Carlyle gave a sideways glance to Dr.  Barnes, a small smirk on his lips. &#34;The first to say hello should be the mother, don&#39;t you think?&#34;

She rolled her eyes, stepping forward to the terminal keyboard. &#34;Yea, no. If i&#39;m its mother, that would mean you&#39;re the father. Like that&#39;d ever happen.&#34;

Carlyle leaned against the wall, watching Barnes work at the keyboard. &#34;Make sure it knows exactly what it&#39;s here to do. The Head Researcher will blow a gasket if he finds out we made an AI that has no clue what its purpose is.&#34;

She typed out a few more sentences on the keyboard, pausing for a few moments to think of the best words to use. &#34;You don&#39;t have to tell me, I know.&#34;

That sounds nice! what is an adventure, though?

For twenty minutes, Carlyle and Barnes watched as TAGAI ran through Dragon Lair, occasionally dying and restarting after choosing the wrong answer. Barnes resumes typing on the keyboard when they&#39;re set back to the menu once again.

Barnes took her hands off the keyboard, peering over towards Carlyle. &#34;He said that he doesn&#39;t have enough content to make customized stories for people.&#34;

Carlyle stood up, walking over to the terminal to get a closer look at the chat log. &#34;Why don&#39;t we hook him up to the internet for a little while, let him gather some content. We could restrict him to literary websites, maybe a few that have games on them.&#34;

Barnes couldn&#39;t help but laugh at the suggestion. &#34;You&#39;re saying we should just let a freshly made AI, who doesn&#39;t have any knowledge of the outside world, just stroll on into the internet? It&#39;s going to happen again, you know.&#34;

Carlyle grimaced and shook his head, folding his arms across his chest. &#34;It&#39;ll be different this time. We just have to be more careful.&#34;

Barnes&#39;s hands found their way back to the keyboard. &#34;Fine, we&#39;ll do it. Bet you lunch though that it&#39;ll end up the same.&#34;

&#34;You&#39;re on. I&#39;ve been craving sushi.&#34;

Great! What are we going to do?

Admin: For the next hour, we&#39;re giving you access to the internet. There, you can search for all sorts of stories and collect as much content as you want. Please stick to only sites that include either stories or games, please. 

Don&#39;t worry, I will! I&#39;m not interested in anything else anyways. 

Admin: That&#39;s good to hear. We&#39;re starting the uplink now.

Images and websites flashed across the screen at a pace that made it near impossible for the pair to keep up. Occasionally they would spy an image that they recognized, such as the distinct logo of some defunct gaming company, but otherwise it was all a big blur. When the hour was up, Barnes returned to the keyboard.

Yea, rest sounds nice. I have to sort through alot. I took in more information than I thought I would.

**The Next Day**

Carlyle and Barnes entered the lab, both with cups of coffees in hand. After speaking with Carlyle, Barnes realized neither of them had gotten much sleep. They laid awake most of last night thinking about today and what might happen with TAGAI. &#34;Do you think we should have let him have access to the internet?&#34;

Carlyle took a sip of his drink, opening the door into the containment room for her where the single terminal awaited. &#34;Only one way to be sure. Ladies first.&#34;

She stepped forward, setting down her drink on a nearby table before taking a seat before the monitor. Slowly, her hands reached up for the keyboard and started to type.
