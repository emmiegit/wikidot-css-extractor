Welcome to the Ethics Committee! We think you’ll be a great asset to our mission and want to make sure you get settled in as smoothly as possible.

As discussed, your first day will be September 3rd. Please arrive at Site-02 by 10:00 AM and wear whatever’s comfortable, as we’re business casual [or whatever your dress code is].

When you arrive, please check in with our receptionist to receive your new employee badge. Our new member liaison will show you to your workstation and get you settled in.

Please take some time to start the process before your first day by logging into SCiPnet with your new credentials. Other members can help you finish this process when you arrive.

Feel free to contact ethistician.aic if you have any questions before you start. We’re thrilled to have you join us!

Thank you, 

Chairman Odongo Tejani

Thank you SO MUCH Mr. Tejani, you have NO IDEA what this means to me. I joined the Foundation to further the cause of scientific research and knowledge, but I soon realized just how much this place was in dire need of ethicists. A check and a balance on wayward administrators to keep our noble researchers safe from the hazards of the job. I’m so, so lucky to be here and so, so grateful to you for giving me this warm welcome. I mean, think of that! The legendary Odongo Tejani, deigning me worth his time!

I’ll be sure to get everything set up before my first day. As a matter of fact, I’ll do you one better. I logged into SCiPnet yesterday and noticed we had a vote coming up on that telekill alloy stuff, SCP-148 if I recall? I remember being assigned to a project before it was canceled over that stuff. Couldn&#39;t get the authorization. So between my personal stake and the investigative skills you’ve recognized by honoring me with this position, I’ll have a full dossier ready for you within the week! And, since you don&#39;t have any evidence of that yet, I&#39;ll remind you that it&#39;s already been voted on several times, so there&#39;s probably nothing, and if there is something, I&#39;ll probably end up catching it! Not to brag, but I probably won’t even need ethistician’s help, although I do appreciate it.

But seriously, from the bottom of my heart, I thank you. I won’t disappoint!

Secure, Contain, Protect,
Jack Robinson
Ethics Committee

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7814 is available on request. Applicants must submit Form 7814-A to the Telekill Alloy Applications Team, who will survey the site if needed and arrange for telekill installation. Form 7814-A must include:
* A full description of the intended use.
* Full, unredacted SCP files and test logs for all SCPs involved, with cognito- and infohazards flagged appropriately.[[footnote]] The TAAT has Level 5/7814 clearance, allowing them access to all SCP files pertaining to applications of SCP-7814. [[/footnote]]
* A clean record of D-Class breaches.


**Description:** SCP-7814 (known by materials engineers as “Telekill Alloy”) is an alloy of mundane metals and [REDACTED].[[footnote]]Technical information classified Level 4/7814. To request Level 4/7814 information, contact the Telekill Alloy Task Force. [[/footnote]] It has a gray-green color with a bluish tinge and oxidizes readily in the presence of water, and has a variable density no less than 6.10 g/cm^^3^^.

SCP-7814&#39;s primary anomalous property is that it produces a negative psionic field.[[footnote]]Further information classified Level 4/7814. To request Level 4/7814 information, contact the Telekill Alloy Task Force. [[/footnote]] This blocks or otherwise hinders extrasensory mind-affecting properties, following an inverse-square law similar to electromagnetism. Its use has expedited many Foundation operations:
* Mind-affecting anomalies cannot breach telekill walls or meshes, allowing smaller containment chambers and safer transport of psionic anomalies. Furthermore, their effects are weaker in such chambers, allowing for safer testing.
* Telekill-lined meeting rooms and bunkers cannot be penetrated by psychic influence, scrying, or mind-reading, increasing information security.
* Telekill-coated fiber-optic cables are similarly impervious to psionic divination. As a result, all Sites have been outfitted with such cables, and all digital communications or transfers of files classified Level 5 or higher (such as requests for files classified Level 5 or above) are carried out over these cables.
* Telekill-lined D-Class bunkers prevent confounding factors of previous psionic influence from interfering with tests.

In addition:

* Thaumaturgic runes inscribed on SCP-7814 can selectively prevent thaumaturgical workings. Site-17 was experimentally outfitted with 7814-Evening cages tuned to prevent the opening of Ways after the Serpent’s Incursion of Site-17, and it was soon discovered that this also weakened the effects of several thaumaturgical SCPs on-Site. This allowed for smaller containment chambers, less extensive containment procedures, and fewer containment breaches.
* When an electric current is driven through SCP-7814, it can dispel spectral entities on contact. This discovery improved the efficiency of the Department of Spectral Entities by 300%.
* SCP-7814 was recently discovered to be a more effective Hume sink than beryllium bronze, the previous material of choice for ontokinesis-resistant architecture and equipment. Trial runs of SCP-7814-based COLOURLESS RED units with MTF Lambda-5 “White Rabbits” have shown an improvement in dealing with dangerous ontokinetic entities and low-Hume environments, and wider rollout is expected to prevent future casualties among field agents
* New processes have made SCP-7814 cheaper than steel, which is why in 2021, Experimental Site-78 began construction with SCP-7814 rebar.

SCP-7814 was first discovered in 1982 during a raid on Prometheus Labs, and first utilized in 1988 to enable the safe transport of [[[scp-035|SCP-035]]] to Site-19. SCP-7814 would see increasingly frequent use in transportation of dangerous mind-affecting anomalies, and in 1994, the first 7814-Evening containment chamber was approved. From 2005 onwards it became standard for half of all Keter-class containment chambers to be lined with SCP-7814, and in 2009 Site-19 completed its “telekill wing,&#34; a wing made exclusively of SCP-7814-lined cells. This set the standard, and today almost every Site has a substantial number of cells utilizing SCP-7814.

Use of SCP-7814 has saved the Foundation millions of dollars in containment costs and prevented hundreds of thousands of casualties.

##ee00dd|&lt;MACLEAR&gt;## Don&#39;t like it.
##ee00dd|&lt;MACLEAR&gt;## Don&#39;t like being around it.

##ee00dd|&lt;MACLEAR&gt;## Shitty. Like my head&#39;s in a five-by-five-by-five cube of solid metal.
##ee00dd|&lt;MACLEAR&gt;## So, there&#39;s always some psychic ambience, right? Billions of humans thinking, feeling, doing... everyone makes a little psionic force, and you can usually feel it.
##ee00dd|&lt;MACLEAR&gt;## But around that stuff, it&#39;s all quiet.
##ee00dd|&lt;MACLEAR&gt;## It&#39;s quiet when I take [[[samara-be-the-itsy-bitsy-spider|psybuprofen]]], too. Except the telekill quiet isn&#39;t empty, blissful quiet. It&#39;s full of little migraines, or maybe one big migraine with a lot of limbs. I can barely think around that stuff.
##ee00dd|&lt;MACLEAR&gt;## Weirdly, the psybuprofen helps. If they&#39;d stop building telekill cells for skips that don&#39;t need it, that would help a lot more.
##33ee00|&lt;ec-user-33308affc0e&gt;## So, stop mixing telekill and telepaths. Why is that not already a standard?
##ee00dd|&lt;MACLEAR&gt;## Search me. We don&#39;t have a LOT of telekill cells at our Site, but some of our Keter cells use it, &#34;just in case.&#34; We don&#39;t have a lot of cases. One of them&#39;s being used for a Safe doll that randomly makes one person in a kilometer radius fantasize about strangling it every time someone leaves its area of effect. Now the cell makes me fantasize about strangling whoever invented telekill every time I walk by. Oh, and did I mention the cell is situated //right// between me and one of the skips I&#39;m in charge of?
##ee00dd|&lt;MACLEAR&gt;## If it were up to me, those cells would be in cells.
##ee00dd|&lt;MACLEAR&gt;## Made of lead.
##ee00dd|&lt;MACLEAR&gt;## Five feet thick.
##ee00dd|&lt;MACLEAR&gt;## Five thousand leagues under the sea.
##33ee00|&lt;ec-user-33308affc0e&gt;## I see. I&#39;ll see what I can do. Neglect of anomalous employees is fairly unethical.
##ee00dd|&lt;MACLEAR&gt;## Please do. If I have to see that shade of blue again I&#39;ll defect to the Serpent&#39;s Hand.
##33ee00|&lt;ec-user-33308affc0e&gt;## Well, that concludes this interview. If you have any other information or know someone who does, shoot me an email. Thank you for your time!
##ee00dd|&lt;MACLEAR&gt;## No problem! It&#39;s nice that you took the time to ask a random psionics specialist about this instead of some department chair.
##33ee00|&lt;ec-user-33308affc0e&gt;## No problem! The input of everyday Foundation employees is just as valuable as any Chair, Couch, or Table!
##ee00dd|&lt;MACLEAR&gt;## Oh yeah one more thing.
##33ee00|&lt;ec-user-33308affc0e&gt;## Go ahead!
##ee00dd|&lt;MACLEAR&gt;## There&#39;s no such thing as a negative psionic field.
##ee00dd|&lt;MACLEAR&gt;## Psionic fields are made of thoughts. You can&#39;t have an anti-thought, just like you can&#39;t have negative mass.
##33ee00|&lt;ec-user-33308affc0e&gt;## Well, maybe that&#39;s just the anomaly!
##ee00dd|&lt;MACLEAR&gt;## Pretty sure there&#39;s more to it.
##ee00dd|&lt;MACLEAR&gt;## This &#34;negative psionic field&#34; shows up as zero or a positive one depending on the measuring tool we use.
##ee00dd|&lt;MACLEAR&gt;## Also depending on the measuring tool, when a normal psionic field&#39;s around, sometimes the fields cancel out, sometimes they don&#39;t.
##ee00dd|&lt;MACLEAR&gt;## I asked around, and guess what I got?
##33ee00|&lt;ec-user-33308affc0e&gt;## Access denied?
##ee00dd|&lt;MACLEAR&gt;## Pretty much.

##33ee00|&lt;ec-user-33308affc0e&gt;## Should, but can&#39;t.

##33ee00|&lt;ec-user-33308affc0e&gt;## Oh! Sorry! I don&#39;t think it should be that much of a problem, so if anything falls on your head I&#39;ll take it.

&gt; **##yellow|ETHISTICIAN:##** You are always seeing things, assuming your sight is intact. But no, the usage increases significantly after 2009, which is when the telekill wing was completed.
&gt; **##yellow|ETHISTICIAN:##** This discrepancy can&#39;t be accounted for by increased contaiment subjects or testing rates, either. Would you like to download the full statistical report?
&gt; ##33ee00|[ec-user-33308affc0e]:## Yes, and can you compile some other statistics on D-Class at 19 while you&#39;re at it? And D-Class at other sites with telekill stuff. Look for any significant correlations and report to me.
&gt; **##yellow|ETHISTICIAN:##** Got it!
&gt; ##33ee00|[ec-user-33308affc0e]:## Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;ve got some D-Class to interview...
&gt; ##33ee00|[ec-user-33308affc0e]:## ...actually wait. If baseline humans produce psionic fields, how does telekill affect them?
&gt; **##yellow|ETHISTICIAN:##** Presumably not at all. While baseline humans can produce psionic fields, only psychics are able to sense psionic energy, so baseline humans would not be affected

**Interview 7814-Audit-3**

**Date:** 31/08/2023

**Note:** This interview was recorded using the security cameras of Site-12, where the interviewer, Jack Robinson, and the interviewee, Nora Darcy, happened to be stationed.
-----

= **[BEGIN LOG]**

//Nora Darcy sits in a dark little conference room, three plush office chairs arranged around a gray table shaped like the Foundation sigil. She taps her hands on the surface of this table, occasionally looking up at the security camera taking this footage. Someone opens the one door into this room from the outside: It’s Jack Robinson, clutching a clipboard and blank sheets of paper.//

**ROBINSON:** Hello.

//Darcy looks at him like she wasn’t expecting anyone, let alone this fresh-faced man in a labcoat.//

**DARCY:** Who?

//Robinson looks back at Darcy with equal confusion.//

**ROBINSON:** It’s me. Jack Robinson? You know, the Ethics Committee guy?

**DARCY:** Oh.

//Darcy nods.//

**DARCY:** Yeah, yeah, I remember something like that.

//After a moment of gazing off into space, Darcy raises a pockmarked hand, the record of a lifetime of burn scars.//

**DARCY:** ‘Lo.

//Robinson sits down in the empty seat closest to the door, clipboard in hand.//

**ROBINSON:** Well, let’s get to the point then. Tell me about telekill.

**DARCY:** Wonderful stuff, innit? Ain’t nothing…

//Darcy looks at the security camera in the corner.//

**DARCY:** …ain’t nothing it can’t do.

**ROBINSON:** You worked in the manufacturing of this stuff for twenty years. Got promoted to forewoman, too. Anything you can tell me about the procedure?

**DARCY:** Oh, you know, uh… pretty simple really. Take a sample of classified, throw in a little redacted, heat to the temperature of the sun, then hammer it blackbox times with, uh, what was the other one, uh, data-expunged. 

//Darcy rubs her temple.//

**DARCY:** Shit, //anything// brings on the headaches nowadays…

**ROBINSON:** I do have Ethics Committee clearance. You can tell me anything.

**DARCY:** Then, shit, why not read the docs yourself? No, no, there’s…

//Darcy stares at a corner of the room.//

**ROBINSON:** Ms. Darcy?

**DARCY:** Lost my train of thought.

**ROBINSON:** That’s fine. Just tell me about your experience.

**DARCY:** It starts out like any other job. Just shut your brain off and follow the instructions. Well, I could never get the first part down. Hammer, hammer, hammer… hiss. Mixers and melters and psio-things I forgot the name, but it’s //quiet.//

**ROBINSON:** Quiet?

**DARCY:** Quiet. Yes.

//Darcy stares at Robinson, muttering “Quiet, quiet, quiet…” to herself like she’s trying to remember what comes next.//

**DARCY:** Quiet. You can’t really feel it at first. One, two years you’re still wearing earplugs ‘cause without ‘em you can’t hear yourself think. Hammer, hammer, mix. Hammer, hammer, mix. Nice. Calms the nerves. Ain’t jumping at every thought that might be a threat. Ain’t wondering, //did I go wrong? Am I going wrong? Will I go wrong?// Nicer. Happier. Calm, at last, and even realizing that can’t take it away from ya. Hammer, hammer, mix. Hammer, hammer, mix. You stand in front of a shelf of ingots and you swear you’ve found your happy place.

**DARCY:** …then you do some more thinking. And you try to remember when’s the last time you… time you… time you could hear yourself think. And you realize that’s where all the garbage in your head went. Behind a fog. And that’s where the rest of you is now, too.

//Robinson’s eyes are wide.//

**ROBINSON:** So, just to be clear, you’re saying the telekill… eroded you?

//Darcy tilts her head, momentarily confused.//

**DARCY:** No! No, no, it wasn’t like that. I’m still me. Just slower. Farther. A week’s journey between thoughts where once was a day.

**ROBINSON:** And this “quiet” you mentioned? Did you feel the industrial noise get quieter, or?

//Darcy taps her head.//

**DARCY:** Nope. All up in here. After a lifetime of being yelled at by your own mind, even an air horn factory feels like a farm out in the boonies.

**ROBINSON:** I see… that’s very helpful. If you wouldn’t mind going into some more detail…

= **[END LOG]**

-----

**POSTMORTEM:** Industrial processes harm involved workers, more at 11. She implied just being around telekill caused the effects, though? And her symptoms combined with what telekill actually //does//… worrying. I’ll ask ethistician to determine if similar symptoms appear in more telekill workers.

**POSTMORTEM ADDENDUM:** They do.

Relevant activity: User Kelsey Davison (kadava@engineers.scp) has expunged technical data from SCP-7814&#39;s main file (Level 5/7814 version).
Reason for relevance: The expunged technical data included information on SCP-7814&#39;s anomalous components and the potential link to its effect. This may have been deemed unnecessary detail more suitable for a supplementary document directed at those working with the material, but some of it may have been crucial information for readers of the file.

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7814 is available on request. Applicants must submit Form 7814-A to the Telekill Alloy Applications Team, who will survey the site if needed to determine if the D-Class barracks are suitable for an SCP-7814 installation. SCP-7814 installation is not to be approved for sites lacking a suitable D-Class population. As of 23/06/2013, all sites with SCP-7814 installations are to maintain at least one ongoing &#34;experiment&#34; classified Level 5/7814 that terminates at least one D-Class personnel per month.


**Description:** SCP-7814 (known by materials engineers as “Telekill Alloy”) is an alloy of mundane metals and [DATA EXPUNGED].[[footnote]]Technical information moved to Document 7814-A &#34;Telekill and You&#34; to expedite TAAT onboarding and investigations.[[/footnote]]

SCP-7814&#39;s primary anomalous property is that [DATA EXPUNGED -- see Document 7814-A] produces a &#39;negative psionic field.&#39; A &#39;negative psionic field&#39; is a mind-affecting anomaly that responds to and cancels other mind-affecting anomalies. For example, [[[SCP-035]]] compels nearby humans to put it on, and necessarily calls attention to this as part of the compulsion; thus, nearby SCP-7814 will compel those humans //not// to put it on, and not to notice the original compulsions. This produces the appearance of inhibiting extrasensory mind-affecting properties, but processing these conflicting signals causes unconscious stress to nearby personnel. Over time, this results in decreased coherence of memories, increased risk of dementia and other neurodegenerative disorders, and heightened anxiety. Furthermore, all humans naturally produce and interact with their own and others&#39; psionic fields as a natural part of consciousness; telekill disrupts this process, and prolonged exposure can lead to reduced motivation, increased risk of depression, lowered libido...

.

.

.

Despite these drawbacks, use of SCP-7814 has saved the Foundation millions of dollars in containment costs and prevented more casualties than it has caused.

**Note:** The following footage was recovered from the security camera within Ethics Committee Chairman Odongo Tejani&#39;s office in Site-02 and transcribed by a developer build of ethistician.aic with experimental updates to emotion-recognition.

[[div style=&#34;background: white; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;&#34;]]

//Chairman Tejani returns from a routine trip to the lavatory to continue organizing the Ethics Committee’s itinerary for the next [[[welcome-to-delta-t|and past]]] few months. He pauses midway through the door.//

**TEJANI:** …did I save?

//With increased urgency, Chairman Tejani closes the door behind him and-//

**???:** MISTER TEJANI!

//A man bludgeons the door back open with a novel-thick manila folder just before the standard locks can engage. ethistician.aic identifies him as new recruit Jack Robinson, and his sudden entrance causes the Chairman to jump back in shock.[[footnote]]This is not a figure of speech: Tejani maintained 0.9 seconds of airtime with a maximum height of 7.4 cm.[[/footnote]]//

**TEJANI:** Holy-

PA: ##red|INTRUDER ALERT. INTRUDER ALERT. SITE-02 HAS BEEN COMPROMISED.##

//Tejani and Robinson reflexively look at the ceiling as built-in alarms bathe the office in red light..//

**ROBINSON:** Wh-where’s the intruder?!

PA: ##red|INTRUDER ALERT. INTRUDER ALERT. SITE-02 HAS BEEN COMPROMISED.##

//Tejani and Robinson make eye contact, and realization dawns on Tejani’s face.//

**TEJANI:** …ooooooh-

PA: ##red|SAVE AND CLOSE YOUR WORK IMMEDIATELY. ALL TERMINALS WILL BE DISABLED IN: ZERO MINUTES.[[footnote]]The timer was supposed to be set to five minutes.[[/footnote]]##

//The chairman’s expression transmutes to irritation, mirroring the groans coming from outside. He rolls his eyes and walks to the far wall to initiate a conversation. Robinson’s demeanor indicates confusion: The lack of mirrors in the office means he cannot see the intruder.//

**TEJANI:** The Red Sun rises tonight.

**WALL:** And the world is bathed in light.

**TEJANI:** We make the sacrifice.

**WALL:** So the world falls not to vice.

**TEJANI:** May I proceed?

**WALL:** Yes, Chairman.

//Tejani begins entering a code into the wall.//

PA: ##red|FOUNDATION PERSONNEL: IF YOU ARE IN THE HALLS, PLEASE BARRICADE YOURSELVES IN THE SAFEST ROOM WITHIN VISIBLE RANGE. IF YOU ARE IN A ROOM, STAY THERE. LAW’S LEFT HAND HAS BEEN DEPLOYED AND WILL SOON REACH WHERE THE INTRUDER WAS FIRST IDENTIFIED AT: CHAIRMAN TEJANI’S OFFICE-## 

**ROBINSON:** //Here?!//

PA: ##red|FLOOR 5B-## FALSE ALARM. PLEASE RETURN TO YOUR STATIONS.

//Tejani turns around, crosses his arms, and stares at Robinson from behind his desk.//

**ROBINSON:** …oh.

**TEJANI:** Now, //what// was so urgent you had to trash the last //three hours// of //painful// scheduling work //just// to inform me?

//Robinson shrinks away. His tone is identified as 14.5% confident, 23.4% harried, and 59.8% insecure. ethistician.aic analyses this as a false attempt to project confidence.//

**ROBINSON:** It’s telekill! Sir.

//Robinson hesitantly walks up to Tejani’s desk, clutching his folder in both hands. He shuts his eyes, takes a deep breath, and with renewed confidence slams the folder onto the center. The duct tape holding the stack together tears and the papers spill, coating the whole right half of the desk — Robinson’s right, and Chairman Tejani’s left. Chairman Tejani, being left handed, happens to store his coffee on the left side of his desk.//

**ROBINSON:** …I’ll get you another one.

**TEJANI:** Make it decaf.

//The chairman picks up and peruses the papers as Robinson begins to speak.//

**ROBINSON:** Telekill alloy sucks the life out of everyone around it. //Everyone// who works at a Site that splashes the stuff around like paint will find themselves at increased risk for debilitating mental conditions. That’s the clinical version. The //real// version is that this stuff cancels out //your own psyche// the same way it cancels any Keter brain-waves. We should’ve known from the moment we figured out everyone made some kind of psi-field. It’s dangerous – //radiation// dangerous.

//Tejani nods idly.//

**ROBINSON:** These things have been known for //years// to the Telekill Alloy Applications Team, hidden behind layers of blackboxing and redaction and clearance from //the very personnel who work with the stuff!// Work //near// the stuff! Build //with// the stuff! This is years’ worth of shameful negligence, and we have a responsibility to fix it. Luckily, I’ve got a Five-Year Plan ready to go to get rid of //all// unnecessary telekill – it’s all in the reports. It’s gonna be expensive, but if we pull out a couple of our better-understood SCPs and factor in the improvements to employee quality of life, the numbers //just// about work out. First we declare Experimental Site-78 a lost cause and tear down the building, then we use one of the many safe, ethical options I’ve laid out to go back into all the wires and-

**TEJANI:** -tear out our most secure communications network.

**ROBINSON:** Only the unnecessary parts! I wrote that up in the plan. I’ll need an engineer to look at it, but it should preserve the security benefits and minimize contact!

//Tejani puts the paper down, crossed his arms, and stares at Robinson.//

**TEJANI:** And you propose doing this to every… single…

//The chairman makes air quotes.//

**TEJANI:** …“unnecessary” installation-

**ROBINSON:** //Yes!// Yes, that’s //exactly// what I’m proposing! Did you not hear-

**TEJANI:** Your dramatic reveal of the known information in the SCP-7814 file? Yes, I heard it very well.

**ROBINSON:** The known information that //they don’t let Ethics Committee members access!//

//The chairman types something on his computer.//

**TEJANI:** Huh. I can see it just fine.

//Robinson stops dead in his tracks//

**ROBINSON:** //What?!//

//The chairman types some more on his computer.//

**TEJANI:** Well, there’s your problem. Someone in IT messed up and gave you Level 5 //General// clearance. Don’t blame ‘em.

//Robinson does not visibly react to this information.//

**TEJANI:** …Robinson? Hello?

//ethistician.aic 74.5% confidence guess: Robinson is busy processing the previous information.//

**TEJANI:** …look, it’s fine. This //is// good work! //Really// good. You…

//Tejani shuffles some of the papers around.//

**TEJANI:** …you really got everything. Except a concise summary. So maybe write one up before the vote, okay?

//Tejani attempts to gather the papers. Some spill over, floating in the light breeze of the vents and coming to rest at Robinson’s feet. He delicately, almost absentmindedly picks one up.//

**TEJANI:** …and maybe send a digital file next-

**ROBINSON:** “The Human Cost of Telekill. Mavis Melanie et. al.”

**TEJANI:** Come again?

//Robinson continues to read off the report.//

**ROBINSON:** “Abstract: Sometimes I feel that telekill must have seemed like a godsend to the ones who first discovered it. Finally, the cruel, chaotic universe sends us our Excalibur to fight the gorgons and gargoyles it coughs up at us. As the years went by and the uses multiplied, it must have seemed more and more like the Foundation’s holy grail. But I know better. The Foundation regarded it with apprehension at first, as we do all anomalies – and we should have held onto that.

“Telekill shields our minds from others’ by dulling them all. Memories break down without amnestics, joy becomes comfort becomes hollowness, the shadows of our weaker selves grow long enough to eat the sun. Those who work it are crushed by it, and dying in the dark. And the metal hungers for more: one D-Class, every facility, every thirty days must lie bleeding on the altar, screaming as their mind is flipped inside out and stretched through every wire and beam of 148. In most use cases, it could be replaced by safer, more creative containment procedures – but that requires effort. So my colleagues and superiors insist it is impossible, citing logistics issues we’ve thoroughly addressed, secrecy on details people //deserve to know//, and – most insultingly of all – //financial reasons.//”

//Robinson’s voice becomes clearer and firmer as he goes on.//

**ROBINSON:** “We are people of the greater good, but not every sacrifice is worth it. As much as our mission to the wider world, we have to consider the people carrying it out, too. Which is why I’m breaking from professionalism and speaking to you directly, whoever you are: Most anomalies contained with telekill can be contained more safely, and sometimes more effectively, with creative containment strategies tailored to the anomaly itself – //special containment procedures,// if you will. And for the rest? One or two telekill facilities in every country will suffice, staffed by a rotating crew with additional benefits to mitigate the harm. The longer we wait to rectify our mistake, the harder it will be, the more expensive it will be, and the more harm will be done.

//Robinson finally looks up, fixing Chairman Tejani with a glare of determination.//

**ROBINSON:** “In this paper, we will demonstrate the above beyond a shadow of a doubt. Mavis Melanie, dissenter of the Telekill Alloy Applications Team.”

//Robinson lets his hand fall to his side. He is still clutching the paper: his grip has etched wrinkles into it. When he speaks, there is 12.3% grief, 23.6% anger, and 63.9% determination.//

**ROBINSON:** Eleven years ago, this paper was published to the //Foundation Online Journal.// It was deleted, and the authors were amesticized and reassigned. Eleven years, and every word became more and more true, and still we did nothing. We’re the Ethics Committee. We keep our //own// people in line, and //this// is way over-

**???:** Oh, //hi,// Odongo!

//A third individual has burst into the room, bypassing the locks without triggering the alarm. Robinson swivels his head to look at them, and Tejani is immediately more alert.//

**???:** I’ve got the //funniest// work story that I just //have// to tell you!

**ROBINSON:** Uh, we’re kind of in the middle of some-

**TEJANI:** Oh! Gene. Didn’t… know you were coming here today!

//Tejani smiles. He appears 17.6% confused, 24.6% relieved, and 50.1% apprehensive.//

“Gene”: Neither did I, but I knew since the story started – I mean //really// started – two weeks ago, I //had// to share this with someone. But it’s classified ten different ways from Monday, so I got to asking: Who on Earth has the clearance for all this? And you know who I thought of?

//The intruder closes the door as they speak. They jangle the locks in a particular way, to activate the Vacuum Seal mode, soundproofing the door, then pirouette on the ball of their foot to stare innocently at Tejani.//

“Gene”: You!

**ROBINSON:** Me?[[footnote]]From the intruder’s position, Robinson should have blocked “Gene”’s view of Tejani. They did not appear to adjust for this.[[/footnote]]

**TEJANI:** …well, let’s hear it! Just let me dismiss this-

“Gene”: //Nonsense!// He’s one of you now, right? Surely he’s cleared to know about us now, right?

//The newcomer briefly wraps an arm around Robinson’s shoulder and turns him to face Tejani, shaking him slightly for dramatic effect. Robinson opens his mouth to-//

“Gene”: So the story *really* started two weeks ago, but that’s more like the climax. You see, about five years ago there was this enby down in Decommissioning who…

**39:43 minutes of irrelevant conversation purged.**

**Gene:** …and we haven’t heard a ‘beep’ from xem since!

//“Gene” lets out a hysterical laugh, slapping their hand against their knee and their calf against the desk they sit on. They are the only one. Tejani presumably exhausted his ability to feign laughter after Robinson’s fifth attempt to interject on a violation of the Foundation Code of Human and Nonhuman Rights. He flits between giving Gene their expected eye contact and keeping a nervous eye on Robinson, who has produced an amount of sweat consistent with a hundred-mile marathon.//

//After 54 seconds, Gene makes a face matching “tasting a new food” with 99.9% confidence. They acknowledge neither Robinson nor Tejani’s response to him.//

**Gene:** Huh. Tough crowd today.

**TEJANI:** N-no, it //was// a funny story, it’s just that-

**ROBINSON:** [[[scp-6355|You deployed a ghost. To give Ms. Darcy’s father an anomalous disease. So she’d stay on for the insurance.]]]

//Gene looks directly at Robinson for the first time.//

**Gene:** I spin you a whooooole yarn, and you go for the leftover thread on the needle?

**ROBINSON:** It’s the only human rights violation in the last half an hour I can summarize in less than half an hour.

//Robinson’s tone is: 18.4% anger, 17.6% masking, 14.5% shock, 9.4% defiance, 5.1% hunger…//

//Robinson turns to the Chairman. ethistician.aic determines his intended tone as casual. Tone breakdown: 7.6% casual, 18.7% “MTF commander giving orders,” 65.6% “scared child dangling from a ledge over SCP-682’s pit screaming for rescue.”//

**ROBINSON:** Chairman! How long until your sandwich arrives?[[footnote]]Earlier, Robinson had asked Tejani to ‘order a sandwich,’ adding ‘make it the, uh, the LLH special from Omega One ‘Oodstuffs, maybe some extra knuckles?’ This is a bastardized version of the example codeword given in the Ethics Committee Emergent Situations Priming Pamphlet, and more easily cracked by any Foundation personnel with sufficient knowledge of Omega-01’s designation, such as Gene.[[/footnote]]

**TEJANI:** …wha- oh, yeah. I said I would. The sandwich is…

//Tejani looks at his feet.//

**TEJANI:** …[inaudible]

**ROBINSON:** What do you //mean// you forgot to order it.

**Gene:** Huh. If I didn’t know better-

**ROBINSON:** You //DON’T!//

//Robinson’s shout echoes slightly against the sealed walls of the office.//

//Gene tilts their head curiously, examining Robinson as they would an SCP object. Then they turn their face to Tejani, giving an expression of 13.4% helplessness, 0.9% mirth, and no other identifiable emotions.//

**Gene:** …well. Guess I’m busted. Any minute now, those left hands of yours’ll //burst// down the door and put an end to our //beautiful// friendship. Oh, if only I had just let all those employees scatter to the Serpent’s Anus or the Glock Ock Coalition, or maybe the Four Winds Hunting Lodges… oh, Tejani, //why// did you approve all our playbooks and procedures…

//No changes in tone are discerned during this time.//

**ROBINSON:** The Ethics Committee would never approve any of the words you just said.

//Robinson looks at Tejani. The latter avoids eye contact.// 

**ROBINSON:** …Mr. Tejani?

**TEJANI:** [inaudible]

**ROBINSON:** I can’t hear-

**TEJANI:** All of their Department’s tactics, playbooks, and methods have been reviewed and approved by consensus of the Ethics Committee.

//Silence. Robinson’s eyes widen.//

**ROBINSON:** What?

**Gene:** It’s true! Check the records. Oh! Yeah, I almost forgot:

//Gene commandeers Tejani’s monitor and makes an addition to the SCP-7814 file, narrating as they add.//

**Gene:** “Special Containment Procedures: As of… Incident 7814-Melanie-B… secrecy… of information… on SCP-7814… is under the jurisdiction of the [[[fire-suppression-department-hub|Fire Suppression Department.]]]”

//Robinson looks between Gene and Tejani, mouth gaping. Then he sits on the floor, clutching his head in a manner consistent with a migraine. Gene gestures toward him, turning to Tejani.//

**Gene:** Is he gonna be okay?

**TEJANI:** Gene.

//Tejani smiles. Tejani shakes his head//

**TEJANI:** Gene. Gene, Gene, Gene, Gene…

//Tejani buries his head in his hands.//

**TEJANI:** Gene…

**ROBINSON:** What possible greater good could be served by that?

//His words are slow, quivering. The emotion in Robinson’s voice cannot be identified.//

//Tejani sighs, wipes his brow, and begins to speak.//

**TEJANI:** The Foundation… you know… it’s very hard to find new hires. We need brilliant, brilliant people-

**Gene:** And all that //experience!// You can’t get that anywhere else! Literally. We-

**ROBINSON:** Training programs.

**Gene:** Too expensive!

//Robinson shoots up into standing position.//

**ROBINSON:** I CAN THINK OF FIVE DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN GET THE-

**Gene:** And we rarely get defectors except from the GOC. And speaking of the GOC, how disastrous would it be if a high-level researcher went and spilled all our secrets? I’m asking. Rate it from Notice to Critical, or one to five if you can’t remember.

**ROBINSON:** Yes, it’d be quite the disaster if our number-one rival found out we have a gaslighting department…

**TEJANI:** Our work is too important. We have over five thousand anomalies in containment, Robinson. We need all hands on deck, and we need all hands to //stay// on deck. As… //disturbing// as they can be, the Fire Suppression Department’s methods work.

**ROBINSON:** I can think of five different ways that work better-

**Gene:** All more expensive!

**ROBINSON:** Cheaper. Not so gratuitous. Not so cruel. Not so cheapest. Not so save-money. Not so not so not so…

//Robinson becomes unresponsive for ten minutes. Tejani returns to working on his scheduling in the meantime.//

**ROBINSON:** So you were the ones who messed with my clearance.

**Gene:** No, that was our good friend the typo!

//Robinson’s expression is identified as: 14.3% confusion, 30.6% disbelief, 63.2% suspicion.//

**ROBINSON:** So you got Melanie transferred out, right?

//Gene looks up from their phone.//

**Gene:** What?

**ROBINSON:** After the paper. “Incident 7814-Melanie-B.”

**Gene:** Oh- oh, no no no nononono. That was O5. We only got put on the case after the second little stunt. Incident 7814-Melanie-//B//. Honestly, I’m surprised you didn’t catch that!

**ROBINSON:** And the Ethics Committee… they approved that, too?

//Tejani looks away.//

**TEJANI:** It was… within their jurisdiction. Employees were starting fires.

**Gene:** “Transferred out” is a bit of a strong word. You see-

**ROBINSON:** I don’t want to know.

//Robinson clutches his forehead.//

**ROBINSON:** I //do// want to know, but not right now.

**Gene:** Is there anything you //do// want to know about right now?

**ROBINSON:** Why not just… let us take out the telekill? We’ve already proven it’s the better way.

**Gene:** I don’t think your calculations are quite sound.

**ROBINSON:** They are sound. I’ve got hundreds of pages detailing them.

**TEJANI:** Mr. Robinson, with all due respect, we can’t afford the short-term costs.

**ROBINSON:** But you //can,// I wrote a whole-ass dissertation on-

**Gene:** And are you sure you did you math right?

**ROBINSON:** You just explained the change-their-own-files-on-them tactic to me- it doesn’t matter! What matters is the //real human lives-//

**Gene:** -that we can secure, contain, and protect with every dollar we //aren’t// spending on unnecessary renovations.

**ROBINSON:** Aren’t you the keeper of the retirement gate? If you want to keep your assets, why not keep them healthy?

**Gene:** The effects of telekill aren’t debilitating enough to justify the costs.

**ROBINSON:** Oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, OH! That is IT!

//Robinson stands and quickly moves toward the door.//

**TEJANI:** You’re resigning?

//Just as Robinson’s hand grasps the handle, he pauses.//

**ROBINSON:** …no. No, like hell I am.

//Robinson glares at the other inhabitants of the room.//

**ROBINSON:** I mean, I should. But someone has to be the conscience of the Foundation, and since the Ethics Committee isn’t //ethical// anymore, I guess I’ll have to do.

//Robinson leaves the handle alone and approaches Gene, whose smile remains unchanged.//

**ROBINSON:** You’re going //down.//

//Robinson returns to the door and attempts to turn the handle. It does not budge. He re-attempts. It does not budge.//

**ROBINSON:** Can one of you get this open?

= __FIRE SUPPRESSION DEPARTMENT CASE ID-880379017499EC__

ISSUE:
@@     @@For the last twenty years, Ethics Committee member Jack Robinson has vocally opposed FSD operations and tactics and mobilized a minority faction of the Committee to improve workplace safety, earning minor but significant restrictions on SCP-7814 (“Telekill Alloy”).

KNOWLEDGE:
@@     @@While Robinson remains passionate about the leisure of Foundation assets beyond the provisions of the Foundation’s core mission, he is ultimately loyal and does not pose a defection or retirement risk. Ethics Committee culture and bureaucracy have prevented most attempts to significantly restrict FSD operations or telekill use, and standard bureaucratic tactics such as compromise and subconscious suggestion have been sufficient to neuter the rest. Furthermore, Robinson’s faction has proven a powerful outlet for disgruntled Committee members, with morally-motivated defections dropping by 28% and retirements by 33%.

RECOMMENDED PROCEDURE:
@@     @@None. Robinson is not a threat.

NOTES:
@@     @@This case is considered **##blue|RESOLVED.##**
