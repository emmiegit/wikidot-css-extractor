= **Cimmerian-Kaktus Proposal** - //The Broke God//

----

Co-authored by djkaktus and Doctor Cimmerian.

Almost everything about this that&#39;s any good comes from Kaktus. All hail the Kaktus. That&#39;s him as 05-1 and me as the Broke God in the audio.

And the composite was done by Kaktus as well. Just to be clear.

[[include component:image-block name=brokegod.png|caption=SCP-001-J evading creditors in a 1990 Toyota Corolla by fleeing into space. The automobile has since been repossessed.]]

**Item #:** SCP-001-J

**Object Class:** Iyov

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-001-J is under no circumstances to be allowed access to monetary gifts of any kind. Staff must relinquish all currency on their person before engaging in any interaction with SCP-001-J. 

The containment of SCP-001-J does not appear at this time to be attainable by the Foundation. However, due to SCP-001-J&#39;s apparent apprehension involving creditors, it may be possible to effect containment through such entities. More research is needed in this field.

**Description:** SCP-001-J is an omniscient, omnipotent, omnitemporal entity named Michael Kain, who is the primary deity worshiped by a group of religious zealots calling themselves &#34;The Church of the Broke God&#34;. SCP-001-J wields great and terrible cosmic power, while possessing a distinct and crippling lack of adequate financial planning skills. 

SCP-001-J requires a significant influx of cash money in order to pay, in his own words, &#34;the water bill, child support payments, bread, and some of those little hot dogs because protein is a must if you&#39;re just barely making ends meet.&#34; However, any amount of money given to SCP-001-J, by any individual and for any reason, will somehow mysteriously disappear, despite SCP-001-J&#39;s insistence that it was not spent on booze, cigarettes, and porno mags.

**Discovery:** SCP-001-J was discovered by O5-1 on a business trip to New York during an event later described by SCP-001-J as &#34;that time you totally contained me&#34;, where O5-1 stopped SCP-001-J from stealing a bagel by shouting &#34;hey, don&#39;t steal that bagel&#34;. Ever since O5-1 offered to pay for SCP-001-J&#39;s bagel, and gave him a few bucks for a cab, SCP-001-J has left no fewer than 17,000 voicemails on O5-1&#39;s phone, typically asking for money or, in some cases, talking at length about unrelated events before eventually asking for money. 

**Addendum 001-J.1:** Recorded Voicemails

The following voicemails were received by O5-1&#39;s office between April 20th, 2017, and May 1st, 2017. Notably, both the Global Occult Coalition and the Serpent&#39;s Hand also confirmed that SCP-001-J had called them asking for money during this time, while the Chaos Insurgency reported that SCP-001-J had called them, but only burped into the phone for fifteen seconds and hung up.

&gt; Heyyyyyy Adam, it&#39;s me, Mike. Mike Kain? You know, from that one time we met when you contained me? Yeeeeeeeah I know that wasn&#39;t a super great look, but hey, look at me now, huh? Got a whole congregation together and everything. So that&#39;s great, say, while I&#39;m here, I was going to ask you something. See, I&#39;m really trying to put things back on track. Get life moving in a positive direction. I want to get some stuff, you know, to keep up appearances, but I&#39;m a little short on scratch, you know? I know you&#39;ve probably got your own stuff going on, but if you could spare like, a short term loan of like $200, that would be super. And you know I&#39;m good for it, absolutely good for it. Anyway, just gimme a call back when you get a chance. Thanks again, buddy.

&gt; Adam, my man, what&#39;s happening. Haven&#39;t heard back from you yet, but uh, definitely still trying to string together a few pennies, you know, pay off some... bills... get that sort of thing taken care of. Really, $200 might be a stretch, right? Because we really only met that one time, and I know this seems pretty forward and I get that. I do. So I&#39;m thinking, really, if I could come up with like, $100, that would really get me settled. One foot in front of the other, you know? Tryin to make a change. I know you get me. Thanks again, my man.

&gt; Have you been talking to that GOC son of a bitch? He doesn&#39;t know anything about me, Adam. Nothing. I don&#39;t even know his name. Look, I know I probably sounded drunk the other night, and you know what? Maybe I was. But this whole thing is a process, right? It&#39;s not gonna happen all at once, and I own that. I definitely own that. But look, I know I said that $100 would do it, but really I&#39;m just trying to come up with like, whatever I can. I&#39;m supposed to take my, uh... kids... yeah, my kids, supposed to take them to the... kid museum. And you can get in there for like twenty bucks, so if I could make that happen, me and you, that would be perfect. Twenty bucks, right? That&#39;s nothing. Anyway, hit me up bro.

&gt; Alright, fine, you know what? I know that you&#39;ve got me blocked or something, and I get that. I don&#39;t blame you. So I&#39;m calling from my cousin Yabby&#39;s place, and he&#39;s a good dude, right? But look, I&#39;ve got some guys I need to get paid, you know, who I borrowed some money from, and they&#39;re being pretty insistent about this whole thing, so at this point really anything would be perfect. Five bucks, even. Whatever you&#39;ve got laying around under your desk, you know, anything I can give these guys. So give me a ring there homie, that would be great.

&gt; Adam? Adam, I know you&#39;re there. Pick up the phone, Adam, come on. It&#39;s your ole pal Mike, right? Remember the good times we had that time? I am seriously in a pinch here my man, and if you&#39;ve got like, cans or scrap metal laying around I could take off your hands, that would be fine. Plastic bottles, even. I&#39;ve got a guy who will give me fifteen cents per pound of dryer lint, Adam, and I know you guys do a lot of laundry. Come on, man, you know I&#39;m good for it. I&#39;m totally good for it. But I&#39;m serious about that dryer lint. Hello? Adam? Hellooooo?
