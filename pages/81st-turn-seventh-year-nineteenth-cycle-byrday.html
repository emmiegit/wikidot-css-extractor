+++ From the Journal of Aframos Longjourney, Pilgrim
+++ With notes by Avos Torr, Scholar of Rheve Library
+++ Byrday, Nineteenth Cycle, Seventh Year, 81st Turn
++++ Forty-Sixth Day in the Trees

Today was fairly uneventful.  However, the trees here seem to be a bit shorter.  They rise above us higher than the swamp trees did, but not nearly as high as most of the trees in this forest.  They&#39;re slimmer as well.  They don&#39;t seem stunted, for they seem as healthy as any of the twisted trees in these woods.  I think they might be younger.  Is this a new patch of forest, maybe?

I did see something strange today.  There was a bird that seemed to be flying backwards above me.  It had orange and blue feathers, and it was flying among the branches overhead, so that I didn&#39;t get a good look at it.  I&#39;ll need to keep a closer eye out to see if it passes again, and if I really saw what I thought I saw.

Besides that, everything was fairly normal, for these woods.  We heard birds singing, caught a pair of rabbits who hadn&#39;t heard me in time, but there wasn&#39;t anything too strange.  However, I feel as though something&#39;s wrong.  I can&#39;t put my finger on it.  Perhaps I&#39;ll discover it tomorrow.</textarea></pre>
