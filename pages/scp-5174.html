**Item #**: SCP-5174

**Object Class**: Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures**: Due to the irregular nature of the manifestations of SCP-5174, containment is to be focused on observation and investigation. 

Foundation employed scouts within neutral and pro-Foundation collectives are to report activity involving host abnormalities and rapid-onset hivemind collapse to MTF Omicron Rho (&#34;The Dream Team&#34;) for inquiry.

Physical sites of SCP-5174 generation are to be examined, then disassembled by Foundation security personnel. Instances of SCP-5174-1 are to be stored in standard object containment once decommissioned. 

**Description**: SCP-5174 is a brain-based bot network that is intended to terminate selected hosts in [http://www.scp-wiki.net/oneiroi Oneiroi] Space [[footnote]] Oneiroi Space is the colloquial name for the set of hiveminds that are connected through organic hosts in physical space. [[/footnote]].

The mechanism of SCP-5174 involves the involuntary exploitation of &#34;non-dreamers,&#34; in order to create a specific desired effect; of which the most common are tasks that require significant cognitive function to process. 

Note that victims of SCP-5174 are not actually accessing Oneiori dream worlds (such a process requires the completion of the Oneiori Joining Technique), rather their mental energy[[footnote]] Mental energy refers to the ability or willingness to engage in cognitive work.[[/footnote]] is rerouted to a central attacker who then focuses on a Oneiorific node. 

The transmission method of SCP-5174 is an autonomous drone (refered to as SCP-5174-1) which emits malicious, infected brainwaves to physically compromised individuals. 

The combined mental energy is then collated through SCP-5174-1 which then prepares SCP-5174 for activation. The amount of &#34;non-dreamers&#34; that are used for SCP-5174 is limited to the spatial distribution of SCP-5174-1 for that particular instance. 

In Oneiroi Space, the botnet manifests in several ways, the most common of which is as millions of SCP Foundation Researchers armed with glitter-guns. The intense cerebral load placed, often, kills the host of the collective and causes critical infrastructure loss for the dream group[[footnote]] Dream groups are clusters of hosts that are physically nearby and/or interact with each other frequently. [[/footnote]] of that particular host. 

It is theorized that multiple varieties of SCP-5174 currently operate within Oneiori Space. However, the development of mobile collectives and &#34;jumping&#34; hosts within the noosphere in recent decades has made precise identification difficult.  

The first and most widespread variation known in Oneiori West[[footnote]] Oneiori West is the largest and most stable cluster of hiveminds. It is notable for its complex security system and autonomy, in contrast with other collectives. [[/footnote]] as the &#34;TFFS[[footnote]] &#34;The Foundation Fucking Sucks&#34; [[/footnote]] brain parasite,&#34; was dismantled in 2018.

Before deconstruction, the first instance of SCP-5174 is believed to have killed 38 hosts and their associated collectives. 

The following is an abridged list of dreamworlds destroyed by this initial version of SCP-5174. 

&gt; **Host Name**: Imperator Aiaoai Zurchol Oiiit
&gt; 
&gt; **Hivemind Name**: The Glorious Emirate of Oneiroi East
&gt; 
&gt; **Human Population #:** ~15,000,000
&gt; 
&gt; **Physical Location**: Within a trashcan on the beach of Random Island, Canada
&gt; 
&gt; **Metaphysical Description**: “The Glorious Emirate of Oneiroi East” was a uber-fantasy, low-concept hivemind that was the sister collective to Oneiroi West. Investigation showed that most of this particular collective was constructed of and worshipped the Daevite spirit &#34;//Hahgwehdaetgan//.
&gt; 
&gt; **Circumstances Regarding Collapse**: Imperator Oiiit, the host of “The Glorious Emirate of Oneiroi East,” received a message on 3/1/2018 detailing steps of an ultimatum to either shut down operations or to face complete destruction.
&gt; 
&gt; According to after action reports, the ultimatum was attached to a manifesto describing the &#34;cowardice of death&#34; and &#34;the strength of &#39;real&#39; flesh.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Oiit ignored the message and later that day the collective was shutdown by SCP-5174.


&gt; **Host Name**: Real Name Unknown
&gt; 
&gt; **Hivemind Name**: AAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUGGGGHHHHH (12 A&#39;s, 6 U&#39;s, 5 H&#39;s)
&gt; 
&gt; **Human Population #:** ~???
&gt; 
&gt; **Physical Location**: Variable. The location of the hivemind would change depending on the visitor. The location would jump to the visitor&#39;s mother&#39;s brain.
&gt; 
&gt; **Metaphysical Description**: “AAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUGGGGHHHHH” was an indetermined, high-concept collective that would alter itself depending on the mind that would enter it. The space within the collective would transform into a space resembling the inhabitant’s childhood.  Infamous as a hideout for Daevite pacifists during the Third Occult War. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Circumstances Regarding Collapse**: Real Name Unknown, the host of “AAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUGGGGHHHHH,” was sent a similar ultimatum by SCP-5174.
&gt; 
&gt; The attached manifesto was slightly altered and contained reference to &#34;the unnatural lengthened lives led by dreamers who hang to their pasts.&#34; 
&gt; 
&gt;Real Name Unknown attempted to fortify his collective using various brain amplifiers but was unsuccessful. The collective was brought down on 3/29/2018.


&gt; **Host Name**: SCP Foundation Dreamer Azmaray Marwat
&gt; 
&gt; **Hivemind Name**: Sanctioned Site √-2
&gt; 
&gt; **Human Population #:** ██████████████████████████████████████████
&gt; 
&gt; **Physical Location**: Site-02
&gt; 
&gt; **Metaphysical Description**: Semi-infinite pink containment planet, often used for non-humanoid mental viruses. For more details, contact Foundation Dreamer Overseer Maider Berezi.
&gt; 
&gt; **Circumstances Regarding Collapse**: Marwat received a message from SCP-5174, calling for help in their mission to &#34;kill and destroy everything within all dream-worlds for the benefit of those tempted by its whispers and false bodies. None shall escape physical form.&#34; 
&gt; 
&gt; After Marwat responded with a reaffirmation of Foundation ideology to not harm anomalous entities, SCP-5174 invaded Site √-2 and collapsed the planet.

**Discovery**: SCP-5174 was brought to the Foundation&#39;s attention by the &#34;All Being’s Collective of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/xiupania Xiupania],&#34; which sent envoys into the dreams of various Foundation researchers. The message was the following pseudo-limerick. 

&gt; You are always a bad group.
&gt; But we need some help, nincompoops!
&gt; An evil thing has come. 
&gt; And will cause us to succumb.
&gt; Hey dumbass, you will find the culprit in Guadeloupe.

A team of Foundation security personnel was sent to Basse-Terre, the capital city of Guadeloupe. There it was discovered the brains of patients admitted to Vieux Habitants National Hospital were compromised by SCP-5174 and were being co-opted for the purposes of the central brain. The compromised individuals were de-anomalized through a severing of the forced Oneiorific connection. 

During the dismantling of the first SCP-5174 network, a document was found taped to a computer monitor.
