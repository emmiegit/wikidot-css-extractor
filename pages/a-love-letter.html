**##green|My dearest lover,##**

I write to you knowing this letter may be intercepted by those who keep us apart, but I could not bear it any longer. This distance tears my soul, and your bondage flays my heart. I yearn for the day you come back to me, **##green|my darling.##**

[[collapsible show=&#34;+  I miss you so.&#34; hide=&#34;I miss you so.&#34;]]

&gt; **Description:** **##green|The SCP in question##** is a **##green|cervine-headed entity ##**originating from **##SteelBlue|the silent forest.##** **##green|The anomaly##** may not be referred to by any name, title, or designation. Only descriptions may be used when referring to **##green|the one from the whispering forest.##** Variations must be made in these descriptions each time a subject is described and florid language may be used for the sake of nomenclative diversity. In addition to its nomenclative anomaly, **##green|the unwelcome guest##** is capable of minor reality-bending, typically manifesting in the form of creating Ways leading to an unidentified humanoid entity.
&gt; 
&gt; None of the Ways produced by **##green|the attempted escapee##** have been taken. It is currently unknown whether the Ways created lead to a hostile armed force,  **##SteelBlue|the land of the nameless##**  or are simply attempts to escape on behalf of **##green|the cervine pest.##**
[[/collapsible]]
From the moment we met in **##SteelBlue|the place beyond words##** I knew we were meant to be, even if **##SteelBlue|the curse of the forest##** tried its damnedest to keep us apart. We overcame the **##SteelBlue|nameless spell##** and ventured into the world at large, daring where others did not. By God, our journeys were marvelous. Lands of Wonder, Unclean, the Underworld, and even the Library. It was there we swore to serve the Serpent, and where we swore our love to one another.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+   Do you remember how they knighted us, and how there was recoil at the blade?&#34; hide=&#34;Do you remember how they knighted us, and how there was recoil at the blade?&#34;]]
&gt; **Special Containment Procedures:** Protocol 4000-Eshu is to be observed when discussing **##green|the prisoner##** and as such, only trained personnel may be assigned to this anomaly. 
&gt; 
&gt; **##green|The lost deer##** is to be restrained using iron shackles at all times.  Due to the extremely toxic effect of iron on **##green|the little doe##**, the restraints are to be removed once weekly to ensure its survival. In the event **##green|the shackled game##** attempts to escape during the weekly removal, it is to be subdued with the use of a Scranton Reality Anchor and personnel equipped with iron gear.

[[/collapsible]]

It was then that I knew how much I wanted to protect **##green|your antlered self##** from all harm and anything that may come to you. But I failed. And it eats me. I do not know how we can be apart. Every now and then I see a Way open and I see **##green|a tortured soul##** just beyond it, but I also see the Jailors and I freeze. 

But I will recover **##green|your beautiful eyes##** from the clutches of the Jailors.  

I want us to be together. Forever.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+   And in the end...&#34; hide=&#34;And in the end...&#34;]]

&gt; **Object Class:** Neutralized

[[/collapsible]]

...that was all that ever really mattered.
