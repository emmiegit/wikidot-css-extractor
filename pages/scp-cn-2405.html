**Item #:** SCP-CN-2405

**Object Class:** Euclid
[[include component:image-block name=https://scpsandboxcn.wikidot.com/local--files/yog/9.jpg|caption=SCP-CN-2405 on initial discovery. At the time, SCP-CN-2405 was suffering from chronic alcoholism and severe suicidal thoughts. Photographed 1960/02/19.|width=300px]]
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-CN-2405 is contained at Standard Humanoid Containment Unit #2479 at Site-CN-75, and is to be provided food bought from McDonald&#39;s for sustenance. Due to SCP-CN-2405&#39;s prior mental state, all request for interview must be conducted with the presence of a member of the site&#39;s counseling department.

**Description:** SCP-CN-2405 is a male human named Ronald McDonald, suffering from dementia, fatty liver, diabetes and cerebral arteriosclerosis. When SCP-CN-2405 is submerged in water, the submerged section will begin to swell and heat up (reaching as high as 185°C), and will recover after being removed from water. Parts of SCP-CN-2405 that have undergone this process emit a cumin-like odor and are often described as being &#34;tender and juicy&#34;. 

SCP-CN-2405&#39;s primary anomaly is its loss of legal portrait rights. At birth on 1900/3/14 at 0:00, SCP-CN-2405 did not possess portrait rights, as they had been sold to the McDonald&#39;s Corporation despite it not existing at the time. Even though Ray Kroc (1902/1/14-1983/1/14) did not have direct access to SCP-CN-2405 or its information at the time he founded McDonald&#39;s, SCP-CN-2405&#39;s likeness was held as the legal property of McDonald&#39;s Corporation as soon as it was founded. As such, any incident involving McDonald&#39;s Corporation and the image of &#34;Ronald McDonald&#34; as a character will be reflected onto SCP-CN-2405.

According to official record, SCP-CN-2405&#39;s current state was designed by Michael Polakovs (1923/2/23-2009/12/6) in 1966. It has been understood through interviews that this image was inspired by Michael Polakov&#39;s character of &#34;Coco the Clown&#34;, which had been inherited from his father, and his experience in the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus; however, he believed that the source of this image was not related to SCP-CN-2405 itself. In response, records of the birth of SCP-CN-2405 were presented, showing its red hair soaked in amniotic fluid, and removal of the baby&#39;s body, which was found to have white skin, wearing yellow gloves, yellow jumpers, a red-and-white striped shirt, and socks. SCP-CN-2405&#39;s shoes posed a significant obstacle to delivery of the baby; following the delivery, Lucy McDonald, SCP-CN-2405&#39;s mother, developed a vaginal infection due to the red lipstick and white foundation possessed by the newborn SCP-CN-2405.

According to SCP-CN-2405&#39;s parents, SCP-CN-2405 refused normal breast milk and baby food, and was able to maintain normal growth subsisting only on Coca-Cola and fried chicken. This continued until SCP-CN-2405 developed permanent teeth, after which SCP-CN-2405 was able to chew foods and consume a normal human diet; however, it continued to prefer Coca-Cola and fried chicken. In 1940, Richard and Morris McDonald opened the &#34;Dick and Mac McDonald&#34; restaurant, SCP-CN-2405 once again began to refuse a standard human diet. This situation worsened in 1955 when Ray Kroc opened the first McDonald&#39;s restaurant, causing SCP-CN-2405 to enter a state where it could only consume food purchased from McDonald&#39;s restaurants, violently vomiting when consuming any other food.

**Discovery:** SCP-CN-2405 was discovered in Haizhu District, Guangzhou, China, outside a McDonald&#39;s restaurant. When it entered the restaurant to purchase food, SCP-CN-2405 was informed by the restaurant staff that McDonald&#39;s Corporation had prohibited any performances in the image of Ronald McDonald, and was chased out of the establishment. 

As soon as SCP-CN-2405 left the door, at least 5 million letters suddenly manifested above its head, covering it; the letters purported to be from healthcare professionals around the world, and were about the consequences of McDonald&#39;s selling high-calorie foods to minors, including demands that SCP-CN-2405, who was not employed at the time, immediately retire.

Following this, SCP-CN-2405 was contained by the Foundation.

**Addendum SCP-CN-2405.1：**On 2003/8/1, McDonald&#39;s Corporation announced that it had given Ronald McDonald the position of Chief Happiness Officer. The same day, SCP-CN-2405 disappeared from its containment unit and reappeared 13 minutes later. Containment specialists interviewed it and ascertained that it intended to apply for the position of &#34;McDonald&#39;s Chief Happiness Officer&#34; at a McDonald&#39;s restaurant in Shenzhen, China, but was rejected on the grounds that it &#34;did not fit the image&#34;.

Following this, SCP-CN-2405 has not disclosed further details and has been unwilling to leave its holding cell.

**Addendum SCP-CN-2405.2:** On 2012/2/11, the Finnish radical organization &#34;Food Liberation Army&#34; stole an image of Ronald McDonald outside a McDonald&#39;s restaurant in Helsinki, and later destroyed it by beheading. The same day, SCP-CN-2405 was found unconscious in its containment unit, having suffered blunt force trauma to the head from behind; the containment unit was flooded with over 20 tons of Pepsi. Following this, the rescue team found a note inside SCP-CN-2405&#39;s shoe:
* We want you to release the footage of you being delivered, so as to protect public health and safety.
* We want you to release how much waste is generated by eating McDonald&#39;s fast food.
* Why are you so burdened with obesity? Why do you not seek ways to prevent obesity?
Following this, SCP-CN-2405&#39;s mental state has become even more severe, and it has begun to refuse food and attempts at conversation. The perpetrators and their intentions are currently being identified.
