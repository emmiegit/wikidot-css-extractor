**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7624 is to be kept in the possession of former researcher Dr. Emily Carter at all times. Experimentation with SCP-7624 is currently suspended pending further risk assessment.

**Description:** SCP-7624 is an orange regulation-size table tennis ball with no other distinct physical characteristics.  Its activation, facilitated by former researcher Dr. Emily Carter, triggers a transient portal originating from the activation point. This portal leads to a stable temporal spatial anomaly, hereafter referred to as SCP-7624-1.

SCP-7624-1 consists of endless network of stalls, booths, and pop-up shops, resembling The Grand Bazaar in Turkey. Ongoing efforts are being undertaken to chart and map SCP-7624-1. Due to the interior orientation of the bazaar, no exterior region of SCP-7624-1 has been observed. On arrival, visitors would appear at an archway with the sign &#39;Beyond Time Bazaar&#39;.

SCP-7624-A is a group of a hundred and one (101) autonomous humanoid constructs that appears to be made of porcelain and is fluent in various ancient and modern languages. SCP-7624-A behavior consists of guiding visitors through SCP-7624-1 and will bring visitors to their desired location.

The items traded consist of unknown or unidentifiable artifacts, technologies not known to be discovered and anomalies from various alternate timelines. The oldest artifact identified was a rock hammer said to belong to the first men dated approximately 250,000 BCE. All trades performed in SCP-7624-1 are through barter and no currency is noted to be used.

&gt; //[The body cam footage shows Dr. Carter and Mason Tucker sitting across from each other, two mismatched chairs drawn close. They share an amicable exchange, their drinks mirroring the eclectic assortment of artifacts in the bazaar.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** //[Smiling]// It&#39;s remarkable, Mr. Tucker. The market&#39;s diversity, the convergence of cultures and epochs. It defies our conventional understanding of time.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mason Tucker:** //[Nodding]// It sure does, ma&#39;am. Fact is, time&#39;s a wild beast, and us folks here are its wranglers. We&#39;re bound by its rules, but we&#39;ve found a way to ride the currents.
&gt; 
&gt; //[As they sip their drinks, Dr. Carter leans in, her eyes betraying a curiosity that goes beyond academic interest.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** I&#39;ve always wondered, though... with all this temporal interaction, do you ever worry about disrupting timelines? Causing instability?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mason Tucker:** //[Chuckling]// A valid concern, ma&#39;am. I ain&#39;t one to ignore the ripples that our actions can stir up. But you see, I&#39;ve got myself a trusty companion in this journey. //[He reaches for his wrist and displays a timepiece-like device.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[The camera captures a glimpse of the watch, adorned with intricate dials and a pulsating light. Dr. Carter&#39;s eyes narrow as she studies the device.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** That watch... it guides your travels?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mason Tucker:** //[Grinning]// You could say that. This ol&#39; thing knows where and when I can go without causin&#39; too much commotion. Keeps the tapestry from unravelin&#39;, so to speak.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Dr. Carter&#39;s gaze lingers on the watch for a moment longer than necessary, her thoughts veering into a more personal territory.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** //[Curious]// And does it ever lead you to moments you&#39;d rather not see? Moments that could change everything?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mason Tucker:** //[Pausing, his expression thoughtful]// Now, that&#39;s a question worth ponderin&#39;. Fact is, time&#39;s a malleable force, and we&#39;re only here to nudge it, not reshape it entirely. Our actions got consequences, and I reckon we must weigh &#39;em mighty carefully.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Dr. Carter&#39;s voice lowers, tinged with a blend of wistfulness and resolve.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** It&#39;s a delicate balance, indeed.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mason Tucker:** //[Leaning closer, his tone somber]// Remember, ma&#39;am, sometimes what we desire might be a powerful current, but those currents can wash away more than we bargain for.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** //[Narrowing her eyes thoughtfully]// I can&#39;t help but wonder, Mr. Tucker, if it&#39;s possible to encounter a paradox here. To meet oneself from a different time.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mason Tucker:** //[Raising an eyebrow]// Paradoxes, ma&#39;am, are trickier than a rattlesnake in a hay bale. See, every timeline, every reality, is its own separate dimension. Each version of you exists in her own thread of time, never crossin&#39; paths.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** Different dimensions…?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mason Tucker:** Yep, ma&#39;am. In a way, think of &#39;em as reflections in a shattered mirror. They might start from the same source, but they&#39;re fractured and unique. You&#39;re from dimension-22, I reckon. Another you might be sippin&#39; coffee in dimension-11 or ridin&#39; the rails of dimension-77. They&#39;re parallel tracks, you see, runnin&#39; alongside each other.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Dr. Carter&#39;s expression shifts from curiosity to understanding, her mind absorbing the intricacies of the concept.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** And if different versions of me were to cross paths here, in this bazaar?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mason Tucker:** //[Chuckling]// Ah, now that&#39;s where the bazaar&#39;s got itself some safeguards. We can&#39;t have too many of the same soul waltzin&#39; &#39;round causin&#39; a ruckus. It&#39;d be like tryin&#39; to stuff too many cattle through a single gate.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** And who enforces these safeguards? What keeps the order within the timelines and the bazaar?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mason Tucker:** //[Leaning back, his demeanor growing more serious]// The Sheriff, ma&#39;am. Someone who keeps the peace between the ticks of those many clocks. Balancin&#39; what&#39;s possible with what&#39;s wise. Best not to cross that one.

&gt; --------
&gt; **[BEGIN LOG]**
&gt; 
&gt; //[The camera feed displays Dr. Emily Carter and Dr. Sara Lloyd seated comfortably within an interview room, their interaction exuding familiarity and trust.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Lloyd:** //[With a warm smile]// Welcome back, Emily. How have you been since your recent exploration into SCP-7624-1?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** //[Returning the smile]// Thank you, Sara. I&#39;ve been well, staying focused on our mission objectives.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Lloyd:** Excellent. Let&#39;s dive right into it. Can you share some positive and negative aspects of your recent mission?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** Certainly. On the positive side, I&#39;ve gained further insights into the market&#39;s intricacies and potential applications for anomaly containment. However, I can&#39;t ignore the lingering concern that my presence within SCP-7624-1 might inadvertently disrupt timelines.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Lloyd:** //[Nodding]// Your awareness of the potential consequences is crucial. Speaking of timelines, how do you view your responsibility to maintain their stability while exploring SCP-7624-1?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** Mason Tucker&#39;s words have resonated with me, Sara. While I&#39;m driven to explore and understand this anomaly, I&#39;m equally driven to respect the fabric of time. I&#39;ve come to understand that tampering with it, even with the best intentions, can have far-reaching repercussions.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Lloyd:** //[Engaged]// That&#39;s a balanced perspective, Emily. Let&#39;s delve into something that arose during your recent exploration. The encounter with Cody, the vendor of futuristic technology. You considered bringing such technology back. What were your thoughts on that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** //[Pausing, contemplative]// Cody&#39;s offerings do hold potential benefits for the Foundation&#39;s research and containment efforts. However, I&#39;m well aware of the dangers of destabilizing the timeline with technology from other dimensions. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Lloyd:** //[Supportive]// It&#39;s clear that you&#39;re cognizant of the implications. Now, during your interactions, you mentioned other Foundation agents from different dimensions. How do you view their actions and truthfulness?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** //[Thoughtful]// The agents from other dimensions are likely facing distinct circumstances that I can&#39;t fully comprehend. However, their intentions might be guided by their own versions of reality. Truthfulness could be subjective, influenced by their unique contexts.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Lloyd:** //[Probing]// Considering that, could you imagine yourself in their position? Would you ever consider actions that deviate from our Foundation&#39;s core principles?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** //[Taken aback]// Sara, I am unequivocally committed to the Foundation&#39;s principles. The idea of compromising those principles for personal gain or manipulating the timeline is an affront to the trust placed in us as researchers and protectors of humanity.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Lloyd:** //[Noting the tension]// My apologies if my question came across as doubting your commitment, Emily. It&#39;s my duty to explore all angles.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** //[Taking a deep breath]// Understood, Sara. Our role is to question and analyze. Now, if you&#39;ll allow me, there&#39;s a matter that weighs on my thoughts.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Lloyd:** //[Attentive]// Of course, Emily. Please, share your thoughts.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** //[Softly]// My son. I know that the nature of SCP-7624 and its possibilities is complex. It&#39;s difficult not to imagine the potential of reuniting with him. But I&#39;ve come to accept that even the capabilities of the bazaar can&#39;t rewrite the past or change the fundamental rules that govern time.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Lloyd:** //[Sympathetic]// It&#39;s a heavy burden, Emily. I can&#39;t fathom the emotions tied to such contemplations.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** //[Resolute]// The bazaar is a place of wonders, but it&#39;s not a realm of miracles. My mission remains anchored in understanding anomalies and ensuring that our actions protect the timeline, even if that means confronting the limitations of our powers.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Lloyd:** //[Nodding, with respect]// Your dedication is inspiring, Emily. Your insights into the human condition and the complexities of time make you an invaluable asset to our endeavors.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** //[Expressing gratitude]// Thank you, Sara. It&#39;s conversations like these that help keep me sane.

**Psychological Assessment Report 7624-EC-2**
[[/=]]
Dr. Carter&#39;s psychological state appears to have remained stable since her previous assessment. In terms of mission readiness, Dr. Carter has not shown signs of wavering in her dedication to upholding the principles of the Foundation. Her responses during our interview, particularly in regard to temporal dilemmas and personal motivations, indicate a willingness to confront the complexities of her role. 

However, it&#39;s essential to note that Dr. Carter&#39;s emotional connection to her lost son remains a source of vulnerability. While she has demonstrated the ability to manage these emotions, it&#39;s crucial to monitor their impact on her decision-making process. Continued assessments and support mechanisms are recommended to ensure her ability to navigate the complex ethical landscape of time manipulation.

Psychological Assessment: **Passed**

&gt; 
&gt; //[The room trembles, and the camera feed captures the windows rattling as the sky darkens outside.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** //[Gaze intense]//  The Harbinger devours dimensions, and ours is to be its last.

&gt; **VIDEO TRANSCRIPT**

&gt; --------
&gt; **[BEGIN LOG]**
&gt; 
&gt; //[The video feed opens with red. Not blood or fire, but tinted red. The feed has a shaky view as if recorded from Dr. Emily Carter&#39;s left eye. Indecipherable words, numbers and bars cover the feed. The surroundings are chaotic, the ground trembling with each impact. Dr. Carter is lying on a hospital bed in the medical bay.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** //[Voice trembling]// This… this wasn&#39;t part of the plan. Cody, you sneak…
&gt; 
&gt; //[The camera view shifts as Dr. Carter raises her head slightly, surveying the room. Dr. Sara Lloyd is notably absent, and the sense of isolation is palpable.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** //[Sighs]// Damn it, Cody. Installing this eye without me knowing... Why is it all red? God!
&gt; 
&gt; //[Dr. Carter&#39;s voice wavers as she continues to speak, her emotions evident as the gravity of the situation weighs heavily on her.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** //[Pauses]// I used to tell myself there&#39;s no higher power, no destiny, just the choices we make. But now… at the end, I&#39;m questioning everything. I made a choice, and I&#39;m sticking to it. Hell, when I fall, I&#39;m dragging Harbinger down with me.
&gt; 
&gt; //[As she speaks, a small piece of debris falls, startling Dr. Carter. Her gaze turns downward, and her expression changes to one of astonishment as she spots SCP-7624, the Blinkin&#39; Ball, amidst the rubble.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** //[Whispering]// No… it can&#39;t be. How did you get here?
&gt; 
&gt; //[Dr. Carter goes to pick up SCP-7624. The words &#39;TEMPORAL SHIFT: SAFE&#39; appeared on the camera feed. The camera angle shifts as she bounces the ball on the ground, and the environment around her shimmers and shifts.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[The camera feed shows Dr. Carter standing within SCP-7624-1, surrounded by the bustling marketplace. The vibrant atmosphere of the Beyond Time Bazaar envelops her. She looks around, taking in the sights and sounds.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7624-A:** //[Addressing Dr. Carter]// Welcome once again, Emily Carter. You have returned.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Dr. Carter&#39;s gaze shifts towards the heart of the marketplace, where a large gathering of figures can be seen. Among them are Mason Tucker, Cody, and the Sheriff. They stand together, their demeanor respectful and somber.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** //[Whispering to herself]// What&#39;s going on?
&gt; 
&gt; //[As Dr. Carter watches, the figures seem to notice her presence. The Sheriff nods in her direction, and Mason Tucker tips his hat. Cody, dressed in a Foundation jacket, raises his cybernetic hand in acknowledgment.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** //[Voice filled with gratitude]// They&#39;re... they&#39;re paying their respects.
