**Translated documents recovered from Ahnenerbe SS Headquarters in Berlin:**

&gt; {{**FROM:** Otto Weber, Director PROJEKT KOLOSS}}
&gt; {{**TO:**  Heinrich Himmler, Schutzstaffel Reichsführer}}
&gt; {{**REGARDING:** NEW PROJECT DIRECTIVES}}
&gt; {{**SENT:** 1 July, 1942}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Heil Hitler.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Reichsführer Himmler, development of the weapon is going well. Before his unfortunate demise, our outside advisor provided us with sufficient information that I believe the new direction our project is being taken is still compatible with our initial goals. However, it is my understanding that the new direction our project has taken will require materials and equipment we do not have available in our current base of operations. Therefore, I am requesting that relevant specialists and materials be sent, and that our base of operations be changed. I will allow that decision to be made at your discretion.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Included in this document are details of project progress before the change in project directives. I have also sent the last artifacts recovered by our archaeologists. I am afraid that your intentions of changing this into an armor development project leaves us without qualified academics. If we are creating a mechanized weapon to win the war, I need engineers, scientists, and mechanics, not archaeologists and historians. The Führer may not approve of this project, but I believe our efforts may prove vital in the later hours of this war.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Sincerely,}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Otto Weber}}

&gt; {{**SENT:** 31 July, 1942}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Heil Hitler.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Reichsführer Himmler, I have received word from your Australian contact. I am afraid that the time and resources necessary to procure those materials are too much. However, I understand that this project is now partially under the jurisdiction of Minister Speer and that he may be willing to make these expenses. Our first shipment is scheduled to arrive in October. I hope you have procured for us the equipment and specialists we need by then.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{We also need resupply of basic amenities and of ammunition. Our local allies are growing suspicious, and it is my understanding that the British and Americans are pooling greater and greater resources into their African campaign, putting our research at risk. I must once again reassert that our current base of operations is unsuitable for this project. Your Australian contact has stated that he has means of delivering anywhere we may move, including the Fatherland.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Specifications of the equipment and personnel we require in order to proceed with the project as planned are enclosed, alongside a list of suitable locations for moving the project and the resources necessary to do so if you so decide.}}

&gt; {{**SENT:** 13 September, 1942}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Heil Hitler.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Reichsführer Himmler, the last relevant equipment has been shipped to the Kummersdorf Proving Ground for the final construction of the weapon and subsequent tests. All that remains to be shipped are the personnel still relevant to this project.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{I still have doubts to the trustworthiness of your Australian contact. However, he has sent me information regarding the materials he is delivering, and I must admit that his assistance will help greatly in mitigating costs of this project. I assume that the engineers at Krupp are in the process of creating the main armament for the weapon? You must understand, Reichsführer, that our research will only be able to create an armored chassis and the means of propelling your vehicle, and not the primary armament itself. Regardless, I look forward to the conclusion of this project and demonstrating to the Führer that our research has not been for naught.}}

**Excerpt from journal of unknown American soldier, recovered six months following the failed Normandy Landings:**

&gt; I heard it before I saw it. I saw it come over the horizon, and yet I __heard__ it before I saw it. It didn&#39;t sound like a tank, or any sort of engine I&#39;ve ever heard. It sounded like something growling. When the gun went off, there was a flash, and then a roar, like a bull getting branded, but a thousand times louder. Then there was a flash and a boom like I&#39;ll never hear again behind me. I haven&#39;t heard anything since then. I think I&#39;ve gone deaf.
&gt; 
&gt; It sunk the whole damn fleet. The whole goddamn fleet. I don&#39;t want to think about the number of soldiers still on those boats. I&#39;m surprised the Ruskies and the Krauts put up as good of a fight as they did.
&gt; 
&gt; The French civilians we encountered called it the Tarask. I don&#39;t know enough French to know what that means. I like to think it means &#34;the work of Satan himself,&#34; because that&#39;s the only one who could have made that fucking thing.
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#39;t think I&#39;m ever getting rescued. Hopefully, someone finds this and it helps them find a way to kill that... that fucking abomination against God. I&#39;ll leave this journal in a Kraut pillbox so it lasts awhile longer and isn&#39;t too far from the shore.
