**Item Tag:** SCP-4816

**Item Class:** --Pending-- --Safe-- Neutralized (Provisional)

**Special Containment Procedures:** Several digital copies of SCP-4816 are securely stored within the Foundation database and are actively watched by embedded system bots. All other found digital copies of SCP-4816 have been erased. 

Several physical copies of SCP-4816 are stored within a secure containment locker at Site-19. 

Access to the digital and/or physical copies of SCP-4816 must be approved by a Level-3 Researcher.

**Description:** SCP-4816 is a non-anomalous photo which displays a doorway and a white text phrase. SCP-4816 was previously capable of altering its contents, and altered to its current state on July 7th, 2018. SCP-4816 previously displayed PoI-6888 &#34;kkrule&#34;[[footnote]] &#34;15. Current anomalous abilities are unknown. Youngest member of Gamers Against Weed. The only known anomaly that kkrule has created is [[[SCP-2433]]]. Professes to be straight-edge and is known to frequently play video games more than the other members. Competes in &#34;underground video game tournaments&#34; to make a living; monitoring of eSports tournaments across the United States is underway, but is to be considered low-priority.&#34; — //[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/gamers-against-weed-dossier GoI-5869 Dossier]// [[/footnote]], known member of GoI-5869 [[[Gamers Against Weed Hub |&#34;Gamers Against Weed&#34;]]]. Where SCP-4816 was photographed is currently unknown, but is believed to have been in a facility or private home.

See Addendum 1 for further details.

**Addendum 1:** When SCP-4816 was initially discovered, it was believed to posess anomalous properties. Following extensive research, however, SCP-4816 was deemed non-anomalous and briefly reclassified to a GoI artifact, though SCP documentation was kept for reference. Following this designation, a search was initiated across the United States on July 5th, 2018, utilizing field agents and Foundation webcrawlers, in search of PoI-6888 using SCP-4816 and several copies of it.

38 hours following initiation of the search, SCP-4816&#39;s contents were altered. SCP-4816 no longer showed PoI-6888 and had a white text phrase in his place. All digital and physical copies of SCP-4816 were equally altered. The national search was subsequently cancelled, and SCP-4816 was promptly reclassified &#34;Safe&#34;. Following further research and several months of inactivity, however, SCP-4816 was given its current object class. SCP-4816 has not exhibited anomalous behavior since, and is being considered for a second reclassification.

**Addendum 2:** SCP-4816 was initially discovered in a GoI-5869 chatroom by Foundation chatbots. The chat logs discussing SCP-4816 are documented below.

Below is a log from a chatroom including all GoI-5869 members.
