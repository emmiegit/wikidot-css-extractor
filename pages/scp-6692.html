[[size 125%]] **Special Containment Procedures:** [[/size]]

Research and investigation into SCP-6692 manifestations are ongoing. Verbal/written orders that contain terms such as &#34;missile&#34; and &#34;small arms&#34; are to be rescinded and altered to prevent potential collateral damage to Foundation operations.

[[size 125%]] **Description:** [[/size]]

SCP-6692 is a series of semantic manifestations occurring throughout Site-81 and Site-118, which predominantly affect words pertaining to weaponry, rendering them ineffective when commanded either verbally or through written documentation. The anomaly itself has been observed in 73% of all instances relating to terms affected by SCP-6692, causing considerable damage to Foundation property and personnel and thus prompting further containment protocols. It is believed that a malicious Foundation thaumaturge is responsible for this phenomenon, although their whereabouts have yet to be ascertained.

[[size 125%]] **Addendum 01:** Affected Nomenclature[[/size]]

The following words have been discovered to be affected by SCP-6692, and recommended changes to be made when these words are not in-use.

||~ Affected Word ||~ Recommended Changes ||~ Description ||
|| missile || armed projectile/hittile || Accidentally discovered following decommissioning efforts of an anomaly when Captain Andy Wagner of the //SCPS Voyager// commanded his team to deploy armed projectiles against the target. When these armed projectiles inadvertently diverted off-course, Cpt. Wagner jokingly requested that the crew used &#34;Hit-tiles&#34; against the target. The subsequent deployment of hittiles precisely impacted the anomaly. ||
|| harpoon || barbed spear || While attempting to use the equipment on the //Icelander Travesty// ship, Foundation personnel reported that all available barbed spears were replaced with brass objects that emanated a &#34;pleasant&#34; sound according to eyewitnesses. Foundation personnel would later scrap these objects for their material, selling it to advance funding for underdeveloped Sites. ||
|| boomerang || thrown tool || Refer to [[[/scp-6691|Anomalous Event 6691-1]]]. ||
|| heavy weapons || crew-served weapons || Site-118&#39;s crew-served weapons became impossible to operate due to their increased weight.  ||
|| small arms || portable guns || Ordered by MTF-Epsilon 35 (&#34;Ball Busters&#34;) Squadron Leader Randy Charles, MTF agents reported a drastic alteration to their arms and body, with measurements reporting that the arm-spans of all MTF-Epsilon 35 members had shrunk over 40%. X-ray scanning indicated that the muscular and bone structure of these MTF members had strengthened immensely. This process is currently being used as a physical enhancement for MTF members. ||
|| assault || aggravated attack || During an aggravated attack amongst Researcher Devin Collins and Daniel Ashenworth, Rs. Collins was suddenly stripped of all clothing and displaced with a single grain of salt recovered from his home. This would later be used as an emergency escape method for untrained personnel. ||
|| bullet || ammunition || Foundation personnel utilizing portable guns during this time were ineffective at harming enemy combatants. All stray rounds would later impact a nearby cattle farm, in which a single bull was reported as the sole casualty. ||
|| firearms || guns/weapons || Foundation weapon specialist J. A. Leigh-Tedd&#39;s arms were officially posted to the master list of employees and subsequently removed. Standard severance pay was administered to both arms for their service. ||
|| bazooka || rocket launcher || While attempting to use the rocket launcher, MTF agents were unable to fire projectiles from the weapon. Instead, large beehives were ejected. Of note was the considerable &#34;buzzing&#34; sound that emanated from the weapons themselves. Foundation personnel would later find this effective as a sabotage method, allowing enemy combatants to take defective rocket launchers in order to use against the Foundation.||
|| light weapons || man-portable system || During a requisition request by MTF-Mu 9 (&#34;Mission: Possible&#34;) for backup as they only had man-portable systems, the density of all Foundation-supplied weapons to the MTF immediately decreased despite their mass and floated into the atmosphere. The weapons have not been recovered.  ||
|| mission || hitton || Foundation databases reported a 96% increase of successful MTF deployments following the introduction of the newly suggested word. ||
