**Item #:** SCP-3467


**Object Class:** Keter


**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3467 is to be made fun of at every opportunity. Heckling, practical jokes and pranks are good examples. Filming the more spectacular procedures is a must.


**Description:** SCP-3467 is a six (6) foot tall, two hundred (200) pound man eating chicken. Subject is thirty five (35), slightly balding, dark brown hair and eyes, and slightly overweight. Name is Hank ██████████, and he has worked as a Level 1 cleanup crew for the past three years. Hank is never seen without a bucket of chicken and only stops eating it when actually working, which is a rare occurrence in itself.

It is known that Hank still lives in his mom&#39;s basement, and hearsay amongst the female staff is that he is still a virgin.


**Additional Notes:** All video footage of the more impressive &#34;procedures&#34; performed on Hank are available in the central reading area.


**Document 3467-01:** &#34;//Dammit guys, this isn&#39;t funny. The system still freaks out when I enter the building, and I don&#39;t have clearance to delete this stupid file. Thanks a lot, assholes.//&#34; Hank ██████████

**Document 3467-02:** &#34;//Now this is a bit unfair. I mean, it&#39;s not his fault he&#39;s fat, balding, still lives with his mom and... No, no, sorry, I can&#39;t say that with a straight face. Come on, alright, let me try it again, I&#39;ll do it properly this time, I promise.//&#34; Dr.██████

**Document 3467-03:**  In accordance with SCP protocols associated with this item, the following record of Special Containment Procedures carried out by Dr. Gears is submitted.

After Incident [DATA EXPUNGED].  With its incapacitation, [[[SCP-682]]] regeneration was being monitored via a sealed observation booth.  This booth projected twelve feet into the current containment area, constructed of transparent super dense plastic developed by [DATA EXPUNGED].  SCP-3467 was instructed to clean the observation booth.  When SCP-3467 was at the far end to the booth, the security door was locked.

The sounds of SCP-3467 attempting to escape and Dr. Gears&#39;s uncontrollable laughter attracted the attention of a 67% regenerated [[[SCP-682]]].  [[[SCP-682]]] attempted to attack SCP-3467; however, its current state posed no danger to the structural stability of the booth.

Dr. Gears observed SCP-3467 to emit a loud, extremely high-pitched scream not unlike a small female child.  SCP-3467 proceeded to whimper like said small child and ask for “Mommy”.  SCP-3467 was instructed to “bark like a dog” if he wished to exit the booth.  SCP-3467 proceeded to bark like a small, frightened canine for 48 seconds, after which the security door was opened.

It was observed that SCP-3467 had defecated himself at some point during the event.

Recordings of the event are available via a request to Central Records, or Dr. Gears.

//“He got on all fours when he barked; I didn’t even ask him to do that!”// – Dr. Gears</textarea></pre>
