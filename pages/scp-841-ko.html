**Item #:** SCP-841-KO

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-841-KO was originally contained in Site-27K. However, it is currently under temporary seizure by orders of the Foundation Korean Regional Command Internal Inspection Department. Site-04K Memetics Department is assigned for incident investigation duty.

##red|**[PREVIOUS PROCEDURES DISCARDED]**##

**Description:** SCP-841-KO is the computer program &#34;WeCU.exe&#34;, which is presumed to have been distributed to Pink&amp;Green IT Academy[[footnote]]Programming and software development teaching institute. Disbanded on 22/02/2003 after being recognized by the Foundation.[[/footnote]] SCP-841-KO&#39;s main function is pinpointing the physical location of visual hazards in a given image. (It should be noted that the program cannot find the hazard embedded in the image itself.) No information is known about its further functionality. The program is coded with a completely non-anomalous code. However, it produces its value via an unknown procedure. Despite the full reverse engineering by the research team, they were unable to deduce the program&#39;s mechanism.

A substantial amount of evidence points to a specific location outside the academy as SCP-841-KO&#39;s source, but nothing is known about it.

Surprisingly, SCP-841-KO successfully identified and processed the visual hazard in the image. See the region highlighted with the rectangle on the image on the right. I wonder what such technology will ultimately bring. They used this program for security scanning seen in airports, but I can&#39;t tell what the maker would have thought coding this.

Extensive research may build a foundation for something quite useful.

We&#39;re trying on improving the software with paranormal codes these days. This situation feels ironic.

We&#39;ve done a series of experiments. It&#39;s a shame that the program can&#39;t read hazards that are too far away; &#34;too far&#34; as in more than 1 metre away, and the program becomes useless. It&#39;s not even instantaneous, so it lacks quite a lot compared to relevant tools developed by overseas branches. We would have tried some research had the code itself has been anomalous.

Too much time was spent on not much progress. I&#39;ve decided to indefinitely postpone research until we find a better method. There&#39;s too much else to do for now.

[[size 120%]]Fire in Mt.██ of ██-Gun. Note the area highlighted by the rectangles.[[/size]]
[[/div]]
[[/div]]
On November 2nd, 2019, a large-scale wildfire started on a mountain in ██-Gun, Republic of Korea. The fire is presumed to have started at [REDACTED], further spread by the strong wind and geography of the surrounding area. While the Foundation was monitoring the incident, Dr Lee Hanseok photographed the wildfire and reported that an anomalous phenomenon or instance was involved in the fire. Dr Lee predicted that the anomaly may cause at least a Keneq-Class confusion. Site-01K redacted military and fire brigade dispatch orders, and sent the Disinformation Department. Footages of the wildfire were taken by news helicopters, but data containing the hazard did not spread due to the long distance.

Soon Foundation personnel were dispatched on-site, and [[[SCP-624-KO]]], SCP-███-KO, and SCP-████-JP[[footnote]]Provided by Site-8123[[/footnote]] were provided. The wildfire was completely extinguished after 110 minutes of the start of the firefighting operation. The on-site retrieval team did not find anything identifiable as an anomalous instance, and the information was handed over to the newly formed Paranormal Disasters Research Department.[[footnote]](Currently disbanded.)[[/footnote]] No civilian damage was done.

The Foundation planned to recognise the exploits of Antimeme expert Lee Hanseok, and reward him appropriately.

However, it has been discovered that the whole report was deliberately fabricated by Dr Lee Hanseok. (Refer to Document 841K-9)

//Irrelevant Information Omitted//

**Agent Seo Jiyeon:** It&#39;s all fake?

**Dr Lee Hanseok:** Yes, it is.

**Agent Seo Jiyeon:** Don&#39;t &#34;Yes, it is&#34; me. How much of it is a lie?

**Dr Lee Hanseok:** The attached file in the report. There were no anomalous phenomena observed during the fire. There&#39;s only noise in the pictures, actually.

**Agent Seo Jiyeon:** You mean nobody bothered to check- Can I ask for your security Clearance?

**Dr Lee Hanseok:** Level 4.

**Agent Seo Jiyeon:** Damn this hierarchy.

**Dr Lee Hanseok:** We saved lives as usual. That&#39;s routine for the Foundation.

**Agent Seo Jiyeon:** That&#39;s hardly the problem... (Long sigh) What an issue. Alright, then let me see that.

**Dr Lee Hanseok:** You need an I-Class hazard vaccination to see-

**Agent Seo Jiyeon:** I already got the routine vaccination last week, so hurry up and show me.

//Dr Lee Hanseok turns on the tablet.//

**Agent Seo Jiyeon:** This one? So this is the start button. Okay, we&#39;re taking this. You didn&#39;t install this anywhere else? I think that&#39;s the standard procedure for this site.

**Dr Lee Hanseok:** No, I didn&#39;t.

**Agent Seo Jiyeon:** The director will love this so much. Why the hell did you do it?

**Dr Lee Hanseok:** The Foundation sits back and watches when there are no anomalies involved. It made no sense for me to do anything in that kind of situation. Do you know how many firefighters pass away in Korea each year?

**Agent Seo Jiyeon:** Do you think we&#39;re immortals, then? Two were severely injured, and three were lightly injured in our team, but not a single mention of them. Why? Because thank goodness there are no civilian casualties. You should know better, you&#39;re in the frontest of frontlines. So why?

//Dr Lee Hanseok hesitates.//

**Dr Lee Hanseok:** When I was young before I even went to school, I lost my family to a fire. My mom, dad, and my brother. Only I survived.

//Dr Lee Hanseok unbuttons his collar, revealing the burn on his neck.//

**Dr Lee Hanseok:** Enough with the pity party. Everyone has their own story. But the saddest thing of all is, there was a Foundation base right behind that mountain, the place I first worked at. Can you imagine what I could have felt? Why then? Because it wasn&#39;t anomalous. The higher your security clearance is, the more you can know. My heart shattered. Did you see it? Gaseous ice, water droplets the size of a house, ██ ███ ███ █████ ██... It&#39;s beyond surprising at this point.

**Agent Seo Jiyeon:** I didn&#39;t know the last one. I&#39;m gonna get amnesticised soon.

**Dr Lee Hanseok:** I should tell you again when you get a promotion, then.

//(Short silence)//

**Agent Seo Jiyeon:** I understand.

**Dr Lee Hanseok:** Thank you.

**Agent Seo Jiyeon:** I really mean it, I... My condolences.

//(Short silence)//

**Dr Lee Hanseok:** You&#39;re welcome.

**Agent Seo Jiyeon:** I&#39;ll call you back.
