@@        @@After carefully studying the 3^^rd^^VD, I can confirm two things: first, it does not require any construction materials to build with it; second, any stable ground the Vesta Seeds are planted upon will do as a source of resources for its growth, no matter what they have to grow into. 
@@        @@I must admit, it is an impressive sight -- seeing a mass of irregular fungal colonies grow from a patch of green paste into a wall, or a temple, or a home... in a matter of hours. The Kashimir-13 handlers must have been regaled with an incredible sight. The growing structures may look ghastly at first and their smell can be unpleasant and irritating; yet their capacities make up for any inconveniences! The thought of entire cities built of the stuff is enough to make one shiver.
@@        @@Past week I gave you an impression on the characteristics of the Mason Mold and its specialized organelle, the Laviano Grid; while I can&#39;t confirm it at the time, Ruperts-2 suspects it works as the equivalent of mitochondria for the Mold, an organelle it lacks. I also believe it has other functions we have yet to confirm. I think the control-linking process that allow us to connect the VESTA application to it and allows it to cast a wireless signal for us to latch on is based on the Grid.
@@        @@Today, however, I want to talk about the two problems we face when using the donation. The first one is the most evident: we must be discreet and this donation makes that hard for us. The Kashimir Programme had to be closed down because growing cities draw too much attention and, expectedly, are difficult to hide unless we have full cooperation from local authorities. 
@@        @@To avoid that security problem, I recommend we use the 3^^rd^^VD to produce static structures, yes, but to program the seeds with smaller, individual structures instead of large, sprawling, self-generating urban areas. Isolated vital buildings may be erected in days (or weeks, at most) this way.
@@        @@The second problem is the safety concerns inherent to the 3^^rd^^VD. The Mason Mold is programmable thanks to the VESTA v.3.0.1 software, but not controllable at a cellular scale; could it be an infectious element? While the Vesta Conglomerate produces wonderful Abnormal Assets, we must remember what happened with the First Vesta Donation and its effects when it passed over to something so inconsequential as a wheat crop. 
@@        @@While we have confirmed the 3^^rd^^VD is incapable of affecting plant life, I do not wish to test its effects on living animals. However, our colleagues at Ruperts-2 warn us that its is preferable to cover a seeded place as best as possible while the desired building grows. Special care is to be put in stopping animals, particularly plant-eating mammals, from reaching the growing 1-Vesta items. We are told they react poorly to them.
@@        @@Today we managed to grow a small, cubic room with a metal door and a fixed window. Unfortunately, as this was the result of an overriding of the original designs of the v.3.0.1 software, the room had current water, electric output... and no way to cycle its air.
We will be working on that. Tune in for next entry in three days or so.

@@        @@Apologies for the late update. We had several run-ins with an Insurgent cell that wanted to purchase our Assets. While we had to resort to calling local law enforcement, which attracted attention from the other Foundation, we managed to evade further trouble by activating the self-termination program of our growing prototypes.
@@        @@Fortunately enough, there have been advances. We have fixed most bugs with v.3.0.1. Skipper figured the air cycling problem out, of all people; a few lines of poorly written code in the end of the sixteenth module. The Conglomerate is not known for making user-friendly assets, but this particular program can be excruciatingly difficult to handle. In any case, we have managed to grow &#39;cubes&#39;, our basic housing, in under twenty hours of continued operation.
@@        @@Also, we can confirm Ruperts-2 assessment: the Mason Mold generates matter, it doesn&#39;t merely transform available matter.
@@        @@I will try to tune in during the next ten or eleven days. Thanks for your understanding!

@@        @@Happy New Year! And, again, please excuse my delay.
@@        @@We have figured out almost every piece of the code. A friend of mine from Geeks Without Bounds helped me setting up a coding-rendering application that will go alongside the VESTA program. With a bit of luck, we will be able to create new structures adapted to any needs of any programme, in a case-by-case basis. 
@@        @@Only a few mind-affecting parts of the code are still beyond us, for the obvious reasons. The Conglomerate is most likely not run by humans, but I feel betrayed for the lack of warnings on this matter. I&#39;ve had nightmares two nights in a row and Skipper still jumps when he sees the word &#39;print.&#39;
@@        @@But it will be worth it.
@@        @@We have been assigned to a programme in Sudan. There seems to be problem with a new emergent disease called &#34;the Sour&#34; by the locals, and it&#39;s swamping local resources; Continental wants us to move there as soon as we are done with the current Programme to deal with it. It won&#39;t take long.

The bad part is that we lost most of our reserves. Hope the Conglomerate still produces more of the stuff, it could really solve world hunger if we planned it well. 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; By the way, you have to try a trick we thought up here. We know the Laviano Grid can be slipped out of the Mason Mold cell, right? Well, you can put it in other cells. It&#39;s amazingly adaptable! I understand your feelings on human and animal research, so tell you what; whenever you have the time and the equipment, try to put it in a vegetable cell. It&#39;s amazing. - **ruperts_33**
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Copy that. We have had some experiments, but the Grids always disappear before we can transfer it to another cell. It might take us a while; you know, pending programmes. Thanks for the comment, anyways! - **rabbitrabbi**

@@        @@We have spent months in Sudan. I&#39;m not entirely sure of how we actually stopped the Sour outbreak, we only had surgery until a couple of weeks ago. Apparently, it all has to do with Ruperts and Opal working together to elaborate a viable cure, and I have no idea of how they did it. Word is they struck a deal with a big American corporation that allowed us to mass test a potent retroviral with alter-physical qualities; morally dubious, I know, but effective. Combined with Aciclovir, it works as both a cure and prophylaxis. Toxicity is an issue but, since they don&#39;t need all hands to perform amputations any more, it&#39;s not my business any more. I can go back to working in my own field.
@@        @@It feels good to step out of a clean suit, for a change. And we&#39;re back working on the Vestan Donation!
@@        @@We&#39;ve made a great deal of progress during these months studying the limits and capacities of the 3^^rd^^VD. Practice makes perfect, after all. It is incredible how working under pressure to create isolation wards can make you learn about an asset; some times I thought the Mason Mold was actively working for us, the bugs in its code attempting to made itself as useful as possible. It was a pity to cut those functions out. 
@@        @@I&#39;m happy to report the VESTA v3.1 is almost ready. The patch will be available for download to all teams who have Vestan Seeds, so check your secure Mission Watch servers! Be certain to download the self-diagnostic tool with it and run it every day on your Seeds, too. You can never be too safe.
@@        @@Actually, I must emphasize it. Let our experience serve as a warning: DO NOT ALLOW HERBIVORE MAMMALS TO COME CLOSE TO GROWING 1-VESTA STRUCTURES. Really, don&#39;t. It took us days to realize something was wrong and when we noticed we the only thing we could do to prevent further environmental damage was burning down a forest. We lost several good people doing it. I have forwarded an update to Continental and International with new instructions for careful Maintenance and Operations. 
@@        @@If you prevent it, though, you can consider your programme a success. And believe me, it was worth it.

[[size 130%]][[span style=&#34;color:#6BAB30;&#34;]]**Security Restrictions:**[[/span]][[/size]] As of 13/10/1999, Security Restrictions on the Third Vesta Donation are to be as follows:

* Only the results of finished Programmes involving Third Vesta Donation assets may be publicly announced, always as the result of a development scheme involving prefabricated buildings.

* All results of unfinished Programmes involving Third Vesta Donation assets identified by parties interested on its origin, its functions or its properties must be dismantled.

* No Programme involving Third Vesta Donation assets will attempt to create structures that behave as lethal components (namely, traps, unstable structures or weaponized structures) by design. Fortifications, however, may be produced if allowed by a majority vote of a Board meeting or the emergency orders from a Mission Director.

[[span style=&#34;color:#35B30B;&#34;]]**Programme Laascaanood (Somalia), in an Infrastructure-Health-Research capacity. [UNDER WAY]**[[/span]] Area of Laascaanood considered critical due to Medium-High Health Concerns which arose after the outbreak of the 2008 Rupert&#39;s Disease epidemic, with an estimated incidence of 3% during the past month in the Sool region and a prospective increase in the number of cases well beyond 30% in the area during this coming year. The current state of overall health in the area is severely deteriorated, and current health care structures and organization are minimum. __World Parahealth Organization personnel will join Work Group Opal-1 and study the current situation,__ __install a base of operations__ and __use the Third Vesta Donation to produce:__

* __Semi-permanent housing__ for the Work Group members. Expected duration of the mission well beyond a half-year, with quarterly rotation periods.

* __Permanent water treatment plant.__ Local water supply polluted by Rupertine disease. Work Group advised to use Third Vesta and First CENTRes Donations to create a functional water treatment plant. If properly implemented, this combination might ensure clean water supply for the local community. 

* __Permanent sewage and sanitation infrastructures.__

* __A type-3 Field Hospital.__ Use Vesta-90-08 configuration.

* __A permanent Hospital,__ as designed by the Continental Branch Architectural Development Office in attached files (Vesta-90-90 configuration). Location already determined by CB-ADO. Building to be registered as locally built by parties yet to be determined by CB; it will be then ceded to local authorities and staffed by local workers and/or volunteers of other non-governmental organizations. Local workers to be trained during this period. 

* __A permanent bio-fuel power plant to power all Programme components and use it as an incinerator.__ Work Group is advised to use type-34 Power Plant. Use Vesta-73-34 configuration in a plain 13 by 10m surface.

* As per Security Restrictions, __no self-protection measures will be willfully implemented in these facilities.__[[/div]]
