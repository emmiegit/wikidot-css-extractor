[[include component:image-block name=scprobot-new.jpg|caption=SCP-846 in its dormant state.|width=250px]]

**Item #:** SCP-846

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-846 is to be contained in a reinforced steel safe, located in Storage Unit █ at Site ██. SCP-846&#39;s containment area is to be guarded by three (3) security personnel at all times. Any unauthorized personnel attempting to access SCP-846 are to be taken into custody and interrogated by on-site security.

Activation of SCP-846 must be authorized by at least three (3) Level 4 personnel. Any testing of SCP-846 is to take place at an on-site firing range.

**Description:** SCP-846 is a plastic toy robot measuring twenty (20) centimeters in height and five (5) centimeters in width. The bottom of SCP-846&#39;s right foot bears the text &#39;Robo-Dude® (Now with Voice Command Action), by Dr. Wondertainment!&#39; Signs of paint chipping and minor damage to SCP-846 indicate that it is roughly ten (10) years old, although attempts to question SCP-846 on this have been ignored. (See Interview 846-1)

SCP-846 is operated using a small &#39;controller&#39; featuring an &#39;On/Off&#39; button, a &#39;Speak&#39; button and a small microphone. SCP-846 is activated using the &#39;On/Off&#39; button, and verbal communication can be facilitated using the &#39;Speak&#39; button. SCP-846 appears to be extremely well programmed, if not sentient, and will respond to most questions posed to it.

SCP-846 identifies itself as &#39;Robo-Dude&#39; and claims that it possesses three hundred and fifty (350) &#39;Robo-Accessories&#39;. When asked to use one of these accessories, the torso of SCP-846 slides open, revealing the desired accessory, which it then proceeds to utilize. The interior of SCP-846 appears to change completely each time it is asked to utilize an accessory. SCP-846 seems to be unable to utilize these accessories without being instructed to do so.

SCP-846 has claimed to possess, among other things:

* A &#39;Fire Drill&#39;. (Tested, functioned as a flamethrower.)
* An &#39;Energy Laser&#39; (Tested, functioned as a pistol.)
* A &#39;Boom Ray&#39; (Tested, functioned as a rocket launcher.)
* A &#39;Melt-o-Tron 5000&#39; (Tested, sprayed acid at target)
* An &#39;Ultra Plasma Rifle&#39; (Tested, functioned as an assault rifle)
* A &#39;Hydrogen Cannon&#39; (Tested, functioned as a children&#39;s water gun)
* &#39;Bug Spray&#39; (Tested, released unidentified organisms that consumed the wooden target.)
* A &#39;Ray Gun&#39; (Tested, released a stream of gamma radiation)
* An &#39;Atomic Grenade&#39; (Testing strictly forbidden.)

**History:** SCP-846 was brought into containment after an unknown individual delivered it in a sealed package to [REDACTED], a front company for the SCP Foundation. The label of the package simply read &#39;MERRY CHRISTMAS&#39;. Agents, upon learning of SCP-846&#39;s unusual properties, informed their superiors. SCP-846 was subsequently taken into Foundation custody.

&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███████:** That&#39;s nice. I&#39;d just like to ask you a few questions, SCP-846. Where were you produced?

&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███████:** No thank you, SCP-846, I&#39;d like to -
&gt; 
&gt; (At this point, SCP-846 began a &#39;Robo-Dance&#39;, which lasted twenty-three (23) minutes. SCP-846 ignored all questions during this time period.)
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███████:** Are you finished?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-846:** ROBO-DANCE IS COMPLETE, ROBO-PAL.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███████:** How do you access new weapons, SCP-846? There&#39;s no way they could all fit inside of you.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-846:** ROBO-DUDE IS EQUIPPED WITH &#39;INTERIOR SHIFT&#39;, AN INNOVATIVE NEW ROBO-FEATURE FROM DR. WONDERTAINMENT.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███████:** Interesting. How are you responding to my questions, have you been programmed to do so?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-846:** ROBO-DUDE IS THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF DR. WONDERTAINMENT.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███████:** SCP-846, tell me why you are able to respond to questions.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-846:** DO NOT INTIMIDATE ROBO-DUDE.
