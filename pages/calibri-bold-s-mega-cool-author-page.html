[[tab Overview]]

+ Introduction

Hello everyone, and welcome to my mega cool author page! I am Calibri Bold, SCP Wiki author and Junior Staff member. This page is where I keep information regarding my articles, work, and other things I find important.

I&#39;m a huge nerd for anything SCP, Minecraft, Terraria, or Star Wars related. Along with writing for the site I also dabble a bit in CSS and graphic design. I particularly enjoy character-driven pieces more than anything else, and I&#39;m also a fan of action and adventure stories. I don&#39;t have any pets unfortunately, but I do have an old frog stuffie named Floppy!

My presence moves beyond just the English SCP Wiki; I also do some translations for the unofficial Latin branch of the wiki, by which I mean I write original articles in Latin then translate them back into English. It&#39;s actually a lot of fun, and it&#39;s gotten me a bit more invested into the global SCP community.

I have a Ko-fi now! I saw a bunch of other people have one, so I figured I may as well throw my hat in the ring too.

[[tab Author Commentary]]

These here are just some of my thoughts, musings, and memories on some of the stuff I&#39;ve made on the site. Most of them are just me recounting the process for making some of these articles, but they were honestly very fun to make, each and every one of them.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ SCP-4645&#34; hide=&#34;- SCP-4645&#34;]]

[[=]]
+ [[[SCP-4645|SCP-4645: Blackmailing Computer]]]
**//&#34;In contrast, all of SCP-4645&#39;s &#34;threats&#34; have been comically benign in comparison, and are never any more than minor annoyances.&#34;//**
[[/=]]

SCP-4645 was my very first article, and was so amazing to work on. It was an exciting yet somewhat nerve-wracking experience, going through the process. I was so stoked to get my first greenlights on the idea, from gee0765 and DrChandra on [https://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-12451232/absurd-blackmailing-computer this thread here], and I quickly set out drafting. It didn&#39;t start out so great, but over time, and with some amazing crit from Pedantique, I was able to turn it around and make it into something decent.

Posting it was easily one of the scariest things I&#39;ve ever done. I&#39;d been working at it for a week or two, and while I was proud of what I&#39;d made, I was still really scared to post it. At one point, I took it to my dad, who told me he was a big fan of the draft. The next day, I decided to take a leap of faith and post it.

The rest is history! I was so happy to see that it was well-received, and was astonished to see it reach +100 within a few weeks. --To this day, it remains my highest-rated article on the site!-- It had a good run, but it has officially been surpassed by [[[SCP-5545]]]!

[[=]]
+ [[[SCP-4456|SCP-4456-D: No One Expects The Spanish Decommission!]]]
**//&#34;May we pray that God has not taken wrath upon us, and that we continue to prosper under His grace.&#34;//**
[[/=]]

SCP-4456-D was my third article posted to the site, and I consider it to be one of my claims to fame here. It was inspired by multiple discussions about the Decommissioned object class and how it was used back in the day. What piqued my interest was that while the Decommissioned class was primarily an out-of-universe tool, the tales about it, as well as how affected objects would be documented (SCP-XXX-D), implied that it had a definition in-universe, separate from the Neutralized object class.

I began asking around, doing research, seeing if I could get a definitive answer. However, its status as an outdated staff tool meant that an in-universe definition was never clearly defined, leaving it sort of open in a way. The best interpretation I could come up with was that it was an object that was deliberately neutralized by the Foundation or a member of senior staff, rather than one that was destroyed accidentally.

As I thought about it, I wondered how people would respond to another SCP that was, to some degree, Decommissioned. The practice was considered outdated, of course, but it would be neat to apply it to a modern SCP article [[footnote]]Not a tale or anything, mind you.[[/footnote]] and see if I could make it work. I already had an idea for an SCP article about an asexually reproducing warship[[footnote]]Long story. Actually, not really. I thought of it and it was weird.[[/footnote]], and decided incorporate the Decommissioned class into it.

My first hurdle was coming up with an object that would necessitate destruction, since the Foundation rarely destroys SCP objects, without being something dangerous and uncontainable to the point of being ridiculous. I thought it would be fun to explore reasons that the Foundation would destroy an object, beyond it just being something difficult to contain. I decided to throw in a couple of unorthodox wrenches here, so to speak. Obviously, it would have to be something difficult to contain and whatnot, but I also made it both expensive to keep contained, and include a situation where containing it might actually be illegal to some extent. I thought of some other reasons a generic object might be Decommissioned, and threw them all together into a neat little checklist-type form you can see on the article.

My second hurdle was a combination of both in- and out-of-universe justification. The Decommissioned class hadn&#39;t been used in an extremely long time, and I would need to be able to fit it in an article naturally, beyond just some lolFoundation thing. And thus the Decommissioning Department was born: a department[[footnote]]Or sub-department, depending on your headcanon.[[/footnote]] dedicated to determining which objects necessitated destruction, as well as finding a way to do so effectively. I put my author avatar, Dr. C. Bold, as head of the department, mostly so I could really cement credit for this particular piece of the site.

After a lot of drafting and revising, I posted the article, along with a short tale about the Decommissioning Department. Sadly, the tale didn&#39;t survive, but the main SCP article did, and it thrived! It was my second article to reach +100, and the entire thing is something I&#39;m quite proud I was able to pull off. --Someday though, I&#39;m gonna get back to that tale. Just you wait.-- Awesome, [[[Mission Decommission|I rewrote it]]].

**//&#34;Bully.&#34;//**
[[/=]]

SCP-3448-J was probably the fastest article I&#39;ve ever made, drafted and posted in under a day. There&#39;s not much to say about it, honestly. But there are a few quirks that I enjoy. For starters, this wasn&#39;t originally going to be a -J. You might look at the cross-link[[footnote]]I&#39;m not gonna spoil it, you have to read it yourself.[[/footnote]] and wonder how it //couldn&#39;t// be a -J, but that wasn&#39;t originally there either. But after a few critters, a lot of them agreed that it seemed like a -J. TheMightyMcB in particular thought it would make a good -J, and was actually the one who suggested that I include the cross-link.

SCP-3448-J was also my first  article to have a video dedicated to it, courtesy of TheeSherm! I was ecstatic to learn that someone had made a video about my article, and I couldn&#39;t have been more grateful. If you&#39;re interested, the video can be found [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W07o4U3LM6Y&amp;feature=youtu.be here].

**//&#34;Come on and slam…&#34;//**
[[/=]]

JamCon 2020 was the very first contest I participated in[[footnote]]While I was around for the SCP-5000 Contest, real life issues at the time meant I was unable to participate.[[/footnote]], and it was most certainly a challenge! Three articles in six days was most certainly difficult for me, but they were some of the most fun six days I&#39;ve ever had, and I&#39;m really grateful for the experience. Below are some short commentaries on each entry.

**[[[I Am Become Death]]]:** This was originally intended to be an 001 proposal, believe it or not! Unfortunately, while I was able to complete a full 001 draft, many critters agreed that it would probably be best if I spent more time on it. However, I was still able to get in an entry for the explosions theme. I was using ListPages for the draft, and as it turns out, many folks agreed that the first offset would make a nice short tale. A few adjustments later, I was able to enter an article, in the nick of time.

**[[[SCP-5559]]]:** Yeah, this was nutty, to say the least. I spent hours straight writing up this one, and I&#39;m proud to say that it ended up being something really awesome. Not only is it the longest contest entry, it&#39;s also my longest article to date[[footnote]]I&#39;m not counting this author page because a) it&#39;s ever-growing, and b) it&#39;s technically two author pages smushed together.[[/footnote]]! Ambrose was a bit of an obvious choice for the &#34;Delicious&#34; theme, but it was also cool to have them team up with the Foundation. It was also a nice excuse to use one of the [[[Theme:Calibri Logos|joint Foundation/GoI logos]]] somewhere.

**[[[UIU File 2001-023|UIU File: 2001-023]]]:** My very first GoI format! Working with the UIU format was a neat experience, and in my opinion, it really wasn&#39;t a far cry from the SCP format. As for the article itself, it was a fun little piece to make. Plenty of dialogue, characterization, and development for me to play around with. The actual idea was inspired by Scordatura in chat, and is a play on words of the theme, &#34;More Than Meets The Eye,&#34; and instead writing &#34;Moore Then Meets The Eye&#34;. However, it also fits the actual intent of the theme, and the main character might just be more than meets the eye.

So, for a bit of backstory, I took a few years of Latin in high school. Can I actually speak Latin or even really know any Latin? Sadly, no. In the interest of fairness, it wasn&#39;t our teacher&#39;s fault, he&#39;s a cool guy and a cool teacher. It&#39;s hard to retain information about the language, especially when you&#39;re not expressly trying to become fluent in it, mainly because Latin is just not something that&#39;s applicable at all in day-to-day life.

Or at least, so I thought.

I was sitting in the IRC chatroom, chilling as I usually do, when [[*user stormbreath]] brought up the subject of a Latin translation branch for the wiki. It was certainly something interesting, so I asked about it, and he introduced me to the unofficial Latin branch of the wiki. It was pretty much defunct, a thing a few users had put together way back in the day, but it was definitely cool, and I thought maybe I could dig up what little Latin knowledge I could retain and put something together.

I hadn&#39;t forgotten everything about Latin. I knew just enough so that I could (very slowly) translate words, find out how to conjugate/decline them, etc. I repurposed an old draft, one which was very short but which I knew wouldn&#39;t take off on the mainsite. After a few hours, I&#39;d translated the whole thing to Latin. I sent the draft over to my former Latin teacher (himself a casual SCP fan), who helped me fix up the grammar and whatnot, and then I posted.

Like I said, the Latin branch is mostly defunct; it&#39;s unofficial, and most of the people who were on there had departed, gone inactive, or simply lost interest.. I showed it to stormbreath and some other SCP folks, we had a good laugh over the whole thing, but it obviously wasn&#39;t anything serious.

Until it was.

See, I&#39;d joked about posting the translation to the mainsite, but obviously, that was just a joke. However, I learned that I //could// post an English translation to the International Translation Archive, and I wanted to see how that would go. As it turned out, it went significantly better than expected. Reception was mixed, of course; I myself was fully aware that it was a generally poor article. However, some folks did find it funny, and many people were quite fascinated by the idea of a Latin article and all, so it saw moderate success.

Since then, it&#39;s been translated into a few other languages, with wildly varying degrees of success. The Japanese branch absolutely loved it, shooting it to +20. The Russian branch loathed the article, dropping it past -20 with only two upvotes, and absolutely roasting it in the comments. I have no idea why it&#39;s still up on that branch, but I assume it&#39;s because the Russian branch has different deletion policies.

Anyway, that&#39;s the story of my Latin branch article, and marked the beginning of some other cool things. It&#39;s the very first original Latin branch SCP; originally, the branch had been home to just translations of existing articles. Since then, myself and stormbreath have both written 001 proposals for the Latin wiki, and proceeded to translate them into English for the INT branch. As for my plans for Latin articles, I don&#39;t have any at the moment, but rest assured I&#39;m certainly not finished there.

Well, this was a trip.

Let&#39;s start with the big one: **[[[SCP-5545|SCP-5545: 𝙰 𝙱 𝙽 𝙾 𝚁 𝙼 𝙰 𝙻 𝙸 𝚃 𝚈]]]**. I like this, and despite the fact that I contributed to only a small fraction of its word count, I do feel that I helped lead it to something good. The Containment Procedures, believe it or not, were actually difficult to write. I got &#34;Safe&#34; for my object class, and I wanted to write ConProcs that would inspire my future coauthor, wouldn&#39;t force them into a specific direction, and would be interesting and memorable. My end result was short, but definitely checked off all the boxes I wanted. A physical site, to contain something they couldn&#39;t move, a conceptual site, to contain some kind of concept, and a mysterious third entity. Weird, perhaps difficult, but I knew a decent coauthor could hopefully do something good with it.

And I&#39;m extremely pleased to say that I got much more than a decent coauthor: [[[yossipossi-authorphage|Yossipossi]]], the legend himself, had been assigned my ConProcs. And, according to him, he loved them. The ConProcs apparently matched well with his style of writing, and he was able to write up over FIVE THOUSAND words of raw, beautiful prose to match, carrying us to second place.

Now, I don&#39;t have much to say about the writing process for what was formerly **SCP-5366**, otherwise known as &#34;The one that links to the brucebase wiki. It’s not like a major plot point or anything, but it’s a thing that happens.&#34; My coauthor was a person named &#34;New_to_life,&#34; I got some okay ConProcs, and made a so-so article about a a researcher&#39;s mad efforts to discover the conspiracy behind a communist sunflower. Didn&#39;t even get 30 upvotes, but whatever.

Sadly, someone with a fairly large following made a Twitter post making fun of the title, and its score halved within a day. I decided that it wasn&#39;t worth keeping up anymore, and I self-deleted.

&#34;You had me at the salad bar closing, and I slammed the +1 button at the minecraft account deletion.&#34;

//-- DrBleep, regarding SCP-4645//

&gt; 12:05 PM &lt;Spooky_toxin&gt; Calibri_Bold, oh wait yeah I remember those teeth
&gt; 12:05 PM &lt;Spooky_toxin&gt; Calibri_Bold, they&#39;re nice!
&gt; 12:05 PM &lt;Spooky_toxin&gt; They fit in your mouth

//-- Spooky_toxin, a.k.a. SoullessSingularity, regarding my teeth//

&#34;aka &#39;If Alton Brown and Wylie Dufresne wrote an SCP&#39;&#34;

//-- CityToast, regarding SCP-5559//

------

&#34;&#39;Currently, the only known way of preventing SCP-001-J-EX-D-ARC-1 instances from viewing documentation is to erase it entirely, then place [REDACTED] or [DATA EXPUNGED] where it used to be. Alternatively, one can simply █████ ██████████ ████ ███ ████.&#39;

This line, I feel, is the most iconic piece of -j literature on the site. Absolutely astounding.&#34;

//--Marcelles_Raynes, regarding Director Bold&#39;s Proposal-J//

------

&#34;I wanted to downvote it when I saw the title because I thought this was gonna be cringe, yet upon reading it, actually managed to be slightly creepy and humorous. Take a +1.&#34;

//-- taylor_itkin, regarding It&#39;s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Eldritch//

------

&#34;Glad to see the Horizon Initiative getting more content. I like the more &#34;King James&#34; biblical style that other Universal Texts haven&#39;t taken. +1&#34;

//-- Iapetus The Acausal, regarding The Parable Of The Three Princes//

------

&#34;These are a great idea! I&#39;d love to see some of the joint Foundation-GOI ones used in some articles à la Collab Con.&#34;

//-- Lt Flops, regarding Calibri&#39;s Mega Cool Alternate SCP Logos Page//

------

&#34;This is brilliant.&#34;

//-- Sherf, regarding SCP-LA-II//

&gt; **kinch — Today at 9:38 PM**
&gt; If I see a font and I can’t imagine it being used to describe a feast for squirrels and a badger
&gt; It’s bullshit
&gt; Quote me on this
&gt; 
&gt; **Calibri Bold — Today at 9:38 PM**
&gt; Can you see Calibri being used in that manner?
&gt; 
&gt; **kinch — Today at 9:39 PM**
&gt; Yes

//-- kinchtheknifeblade, regarding fonts//

------

&#34;Criminally underrated! The dialogue felt a bit sharp at points, and the story as a whole could have used some tightening, but at it&#39;s core this was a very fun ride. The heist was engaging, the stakes were clear, and the GOI itself left me wanting more. It&#39;s a very cool idea for an antagonist group. I kinda&#39; want to play with them in some future articles.&#34;

//-- T Rutherford, regarding SCP-6900-D//

[[tab Ownership &amp; Emergency Information]]

**My Artwork:** My art can be used in any article, provided that I am credited in an author post or something similar.

**Rewrites/Ownership:** If I&#39;ve been inactive for at least six months and cannot be contacted, then [[*user CelesteKara]] has authority over my articles, unless/until I return from hiatus. Coauthored articles are an exception, and ownership is transferred to their respective coauthors.

**Use of Original Work:** Any of my articles, characters, or other on-site work can be referenced in articles or used in merchandise, as long as they are properly attributed. However, I strongly request that they are not used or applied in any NSFW work or similar context.

**Emergency Contacts:** If I am desperately needed and cannot be reached over IRC or Wikidot, a bunch of folks have my Discord information, and [[*user CelesteKara]] has my phone number; they can reach out to me for you.

[[tab Other]]

This tab is just for anything else that I need to keep track of or whatever.
