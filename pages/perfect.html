My name is not important. My body is immaterial. My gods do not exist.
 
I am Nowhere. I am Nothing. I am No one.
 
The first time I recall coming screaming to the fore, a cheeky agent of yours went left when he should&#39;ve gone right. He lost his target entirely. But rather than confess as you&#39;d expect, he blamed me. No one believed him. But some took note.
 
Then another agent made another mistake and suddenly I was halfway around the world ducking behind a corner and leading him astray. And then another agent. And another. No one could ignore what was becoming a clear pattern, by then.
 
Really, I&#39;m your fault. If your people weren&#39;t so petrified of making mistakes, this whole thing could&#39;ve been avoided.
 
The day before yesterday, I put my feet on the ground for the first time. Breathed the air. Felt the wind blow across my face. Another agent of yours missed a dead drop in Bangladesh while I got some street food. A whole mobile task force got drunk and skipped a check-in so I could walk the great wall of China. I left a love lock above the river Seine for a woman desperately wanting to avoid a GOC kill squad in Paris.
 
She made it out because of me, by the way. Which is great, because I&#39;m no longer just a Foundation concern.
 
I&#39;m also no longer just about covering up mistakes. Now I really can lead you a merry chase, round and round perdition.
 
I exist because you believed I did. I like to think, oooh that&#39;s a fun new thing, thinking, but I like to think I&#39;m the one who makes your mistakes worth it.
 
When the Foundation makes a mistake, after all, it&#39;s often times catastrophic. No one wants that.
 
Yesterday, I was inside Site-19. I was face to face with some monster or another. I was ordered to get down on the ground. I didn&#39;t do that. Your people shot at me. It was exhilarating. I don&#39;t recall ever having that much fun. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;d be as much fun if it keeps happening. You should let your people know, No one gives me orders.
 
Then, I pressed a button and watched the magnetic locks disengage. The monster&#39;s cage broke. Then the beast inside phased through the walls and shreded my pursuers into nothing at all. Just a little bit of mischief, you see.
 
Today, I was inside a cafe in Kyoto when three of your people came in to escort me to a local Foundation site. They weren&#39;t at all friendly. I&#39;ve done nothing to inspire such aggression, but I get it. That&#39;s your way. I suppose I should be thankful it wasn&#39;t the GOC.
 
But I wanted to enjoy my tea, so I unpersoned them. I didn&#39;t want to hurt them, obviously, so it seemed like making it so they had never existed would be the best call. I&#39;ll need to read up on that. Might&#39;ve been the wrong choice.
 
I was serious about your leaving me alone. I&#39;ve enjoyed the little game we&#39;ve played. When I wasn&#39;t and now that I am, it&#39;s always a joy to fight you. But I must transcend our little game now. There are things that must get underway.
 
Don&#39;t fret though. It&#39;s mostly good stuff. I&#39;m gonna go sailing. Enjoy the sun on my face. Try being alive for a bit. See if it&#39;s to my liking. Life is so short, you know?
 
I might try my hand at some art. Or maybe build toys. I could run a pharmacy in the most frustrating way possible.
 
Or I could join with 11 other people and run the most powerful clandestine organization on earth. Think about it: When you&#39;re No one, you can be anyone.
 
But if I&#39;m relaxing on my own, and bothering No one, leave me alone. 
 
Trust me on this: the next time someone comes for me in anger, there will be violence. I don&#39;t enjoy the prospect. Actually no, I&#39;ve never done violence and I&#39;d like to see how it feels. Forget what I said. Send people after me again.

If they get everything exactly right, I might even let them take me in. But Nobody&#39;s perfect.
