**Item #:** SCP-4111

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** No instances of SCP-4111-1 may be created without Level-3 Authorization. Any existing instances of SCP-4111-1 not currently in use must be stored in a secure anomalous items locker, and is not to come in contact with a salt water solution, unless authorized for transport to SCP-4111.

Foundation personnel who wish to explore SCP-4111 for an extended period of time will be supplied with a standard arid climate survival kit. Personnel who find themselves trapped in SCP-4111 for any reason are to be recovered as soon as possible.

Should any other humans be found within SCP-4111, they are to be retrieved, interviewed, amnesticized and integrated back into society.

**Description:** SCP-4111 is a location, currently believed not to be on Earth[[footnote]]Whether the location is an entirely different planet, universe, dimension or other is currently unknown.[[/footnote]] that can be accessed by enacting a specific ritual. The ritual itself can transport multiple people as well as objects between locations under specific circumstances. (See SCP-4111-1 below for clarification.)

SCP-4111 is apparently entirely underground, with a breathable atmosphere, and the majority of the visible land mass is solidified halite[[footnote]]Also known as rock salt.[[/footnote]], which is interspersed by rivers, lakes and occasionally oceans of superheated, liquified halite. There is no visible light source outside of the ambient light given off by the superheated halite, and further exploration of the location has revealed a ceiling of currently indeterminable height, also made of solidified halite. All natural structures within SCP-4111 are cuboid in structure, no natural curves have been observed while in SCP-4111.

SCP-4111-1 is an object that must be created in order to transport subjects and objects to SCP-4111. While certain variables about the object may change, certain aspects such as the stuffing and the shape must follow a guideline detailed in the instruction manual by an organization called the &#34;Gemenskap Coalition&#34;[[footnote]]Little information about the organization has been discovered, however one of its major goals appears to be uniting communities through occult practices.[[/footnote]] discovered alongside PoI-418. For information on creating an instance of SCP-4111-1, please go to Addendum 4111-A. Successfully created instances of SCP-4111-1 will flash a yellow light briefly and emit a three-toned chime upon completion. Upon submerging an instance of SCP-4111-1 in a salt water solution, the next human and any other people or objects[[footnote]]Weighing up to 500 kg.[[/footnote]] it is in contact with will be transported to SCP-4111, along with the instance of SCP-4111-1. 

The only way to return from SCP-4111 is death; should the subject who initiated the ritual to SCP-4111 die while inside SCP-4111 for any reason, they and any other people and objects the subject is in contact with will be transported back to the location in which the ritual was initiated. After the subject&#39;s death, they and any other people brought with them will be alive and healed of all injuries sustained within SCP-4111 and SCP-4111-1 will appear somewhere beside the subject rather than in its possession. Subjects retain memories of their time within SCP-4111, up to and including their death.

Several objects supposedly not native to SCP-4111 have been found during exploration logs, as detailed below. The following list supports the claim that SCP-4111 has been visited numerous times and has been explored by people prior to the Foundation&#39;s discovery of it:

[[collapsible show=&#34;Show List of Discovered Items from SCP-4111&#34; hide=&#34;Hide List&#34;]]

&gt; * Several human and animal skeletons.
&gt; * Several wooden chests containing cut and uncut gemstones of varying quality and value.[[footnote]]Some buried beneath the ground, some located above ground. Successfully opening one of these chests will emit a similar three-toned chime to the one heard when completing an instance of SCP-4111-1.[[/footnote]]
&gt; * A package of Golden Oreos, half-eaten.
&gt; * An iPhone 4.
&gt; * A M1911 pistol.
&gt; * A pickaxe.
&gt; * A man-made water reservoir with a filtration machine and a single metal cup.[[footnote]]Wear on the surrounding land show this location has been visited often.[[/footnote]]
&gt; * An apple tree orchard, along with several apple cores in varying states of decay.[[footnote]]Bite marks in instances vary, only some being distinctly human.[[/footnote]]

**Discovery:** On 9/28/20██ PoI-418, the first subject known to have travelled to SCP-4111, suddenly appeared near the wreckage of the ████████, a ship that sunk in the Atlantic Ocean around 2009. PoI-418&#39;s manifestation was captured by an ROV controlled by [REDACTED] exploring the area at the time. When the event was reported that a man had suddenly appeared in the ocean during an exploration, the Foundation located and recovered them, amnesticizing any witnesses. Recordings of PoI-418&#39;s manifestation were confiscated, and the ROV responsible for the recording was destroyed and sunk, given the cover story of a malfunction during the exploration.

Below is an interview with PoI-418 post-recovery.

&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Swietner coughs and sits down.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Swietner:** Alright, you feeling comfy? Considering the reports of the situation we just dragged you from, we figure you might want a chance to sit on something not made of metal. Or salt. Hopefully that cushion is good enough.
&gt; 
&gt; //PoI-418 adjusts in his seat.//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** I appreciate it but... I&#39;m more just happy to finally see some human faces after so long.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Swietner:** Right, right, we heard your explanation about the doll and the... &#34;salt world&#34;.
&gt; 
&gt; //PoI-418 looks like he&#39;s about to speak, Agent Swietner holds up their hand.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Swietner:** Before you even start to worry... we believe you. Well, we don&#39;t necessarily believe the fact that you claimed it was literally Hell, but we believe you went to somewhere else.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** I mean, what else would you call where I went?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Swietner:** Well, I haven&#39;t personally been there, so I guess I&#39;m not one to say. But the specifics of what you call where you went don&#39;t matter right now. What matters is how you got //back.//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** I... I don&#39;t know how I got back. I don&#39;t even know how I got //in//. One moment I was just underwater, then I found that doll and when I touched it everything went black. Except this one, like, white horizontal line that I could see. I tried moving towards it, but the next thing I knew I was... I was there.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Swietner:** We figure that the doll has something to do with your entry, obviously, but what we //need// to know how you managed to escape. What was the last thing you remember?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** The last thing I remember? Well... the last thing I remember is... is...
&gt; 
&gt; //PoI-418&#39;s expression becomes worried.//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** Was anyone else with me when I got out?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Swietner:** Was anyone else... No, nobody else was there with you, from what I read.
&gt; 
&gt; //PoI-418 hunches over and begins pulling his hair with his hands.//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** No, no, no no no no...
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Swietner:** Are you trying to say that someone came with you that didn&#39;t make it out?
&gt; 
&gt; //PoI-418 rubs his eyes and inhales deeply.//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** I need to go back. I need that doll, I //need// to go back.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Swietner:** If there&#39;s somebody else there, we&#39;ll find a way to get in, retrieve them and bring them back. But we need to know how //you// got back before we can do that.
&gt; 
&gt; //PoI-418 sighs.//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** The last thing I remember is that I died. Sydneigh and I were trying to cross a river when the ground collapsed beneath me. 
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Swietner leans forward.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Swietner:** Sydney?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** Syd//neigh//. Like Sydney, but a horse. That&#39;s what I named her.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Swietner:** You found... a horse?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** No, she found //me//. When I was lying there, half-deaf, half-dead and suffering from the pressure change, she came to me and dragged me over to some place that wasn&#39;t swelteringly hot. She&#39;s a good horse and I need to get her here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Swietner:** Well, if you died in there, who&#39;s to say that death isn&#39;t what brings you back? How long could a horse realistically last on her own?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** She&#39;s not one to die fast. She&#39;s a survivor, I bet she was there long before I was.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Swietner:** How do you know?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** She lead me to a farm. Well, kind of a farm. Someone tried to make one there, apparently. I figure that&#39;s why she&#39;s there at all. Don&#39;t know how long she&#39;s been there, though.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Swietner:** Well, if you claim that the last thing that happened before you came back to here was your death, once we run a few tests we will gladly kill your horse for you.
&gt; 
&gt; //PoI-418 looks up at Agent Swietner.//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** No, I want to do it myself. You didn&#39;t bond with her like I did, if she needs to die to get back here, I want to be the one that kills her.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Swietner:** I&#39;m not entirely sure that&#39;s going to be possible, considering—
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** I know that place better than anyone. I was there for, what, a month? I&#39;ve explored the area, I know where we would need to go to find her.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Swietner:** ...Considering the fact that we&#39;re still not sure that&#39;s the only way to return.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** What, do you need to run tests? I&#39;ll be a guinea pig, I don&#39;t care, I&#39;ll do whatever I need to do to get your permission to find her and bring her back.
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Swietner and PoI-418 are silent for several moments before Agent Swietner sighs.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Swietner:** You seem like a good guy. I&#39;ll see what I can do, but I make no promises. 
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Swietner pauses.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Swietner:** Though finding a person //willing// to be a test subject is a rare thing in our line of work, so you might just be lucky.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** Thank you. I&#39;ll give you whatever other information you need so long as you let //me// be the one that goes in there.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Swietner:** Again, no promises.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**

[[/collapsible]]

Since this interview, PoI-418 has been completely compliant to any questions the Foundation has asked of him, and has willingly volunteered for any testing regarding entering and leaving SCP-4111. His request to attempt to rescue &#34;Sydneigh&#34; (Furthermore PoI-418-H) has been approved under the circumstances that he be fully amnesticized after the extraction is complete.

**Addendum 4111-A:** Shortly after PoI-418&#39;s recovery, the Foundation launched an independent exploration of the ████████ for any information regarding his manifestation. Discovered near PoI-418&#39;s point of manifestation was a single instance of SCP-4111-1. Further exploration discovered four further instances of SCP-4111-1, somehow intact. In addition, a water-logged book was discovered, with partially destroyed instructions regarding the creation and use of instances of SCP-4111-1. After partial restoration, the Foundation was able to determine the following key aspects in the creation of an instance of SCP-4111-1:

[[collapsible show=&#34;Level-3/4111 Clearance Required&#34; hide=&#34;Access Granted&#34;]]

&gt; * Instances of SCP-4111-1 must created with cloth, yarn, or silk.
&gt; * Instances of SCP-4111-1 must resemble a four-limbed humanoid.
&gt; * Instances of SCP-4111-1 must be filled with salt, soil, flaked obsidian and ash.

[[/collapsible]]

The Foundation has since been able to create further instances of SCP-4111-1 to access SCP-4111 at will.

**Extraction of PoI-418-H:** On 11/16/20██, MTF Epsilon-9 (&#34;Fire Eaters&#34;) along with PoI-418 successfully completed multiple individual rituals to enter SCP-4111 with intent to safely retrieve PoI-418-H. Along with PoI-418, four agents were selected to traveled with him, codenamed Agent Pele, Agent Chantico, Agent Hephaestus and Agent Lalahon.

&gt; **Date:** 11/16/██
&gt; **Foreward:** The following footage is from Agent Pele&#39;s body camera.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; //Imagery shifts from the Foundation Secure Testing Facility to a dark cavern. Agent Pele turns towards the rest of the team. PoI-418 is fumbling with his gear, adjusting it.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Pele:** 418, you alright there?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** Uh, yeah, no worries here. I don&#39;t know how you all get used to this much bulk, though.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Chantico:** It&#39;s either this or die to heat exposure. The suit may be a bit hard to maneuver in, but otherwise it keeps you cool.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hephaestus:** Trust us, the four of us have stress-tested these suits here plenty.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** Wait... um...
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Chantico turns towards PoI-418.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Chantico:** Something else the matter? If you&#39;re scared you don&#39;t need to worry. We&#39;ll get your little friend out of here in no time. Don&#39;t even fret, hun.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** It&#39;s not that, it&#39;s... I survived here a month without this gear. And I didn&#39;t die because of heat exposure. Hell, I was in a wetsuit for most of the time.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Pele:** Hm. Strange.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hephaestus:** I&#39;m sure you stayed away from the molten salt lakes, yeah?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** I mean, I tried to. If I needed water I had to cross over a molten river but I stayed away in the shade as much as I could.
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Hephaestus walks up and pats PoI-418 on the shoulder.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hephaestus:** Then that&#39;s probably why.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Pele:** Regardless of what you were wearing then, these suits were designed to retain body temperature even in extreme environments. You&#39;ll at the very least not be suffering.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** Cheery way to put it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Pele:** We&#39;re not exactly in a cheery situation. Now come on, let&#39;s move.
&gt; 
&gt; //Agents Pele and Lalahon take the lead, PoI-418 in the middle, Agents Chantico and Hephaestus in the back. They make their way through the cavern, heading towards a light which they assume to be the mouth.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hephaestus:** So, a whole month here, huh? And not a single human? No wonder your best friend is a horse.
&gt; 
&gt; //The sound of Agent Chantico punching Agent Hephaestus is heard.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hephaestus:** Hey, what was that for?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Chantico:** Don&#39;t be a dick, Hef. You have no right to judge him for that.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** I mean, he&#39;s right, kind of. I was desperate to meet someone, to see someone else in this place. Sydneigh was always there for me, for whatever I needed.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hephaestus:** Gross.
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Chantico once again punches Agent Hephaestus in the shoulder.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hephaestus:** Kidding, obviously!... I knew what he meant.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lalahon:** Out of curiosity, why &#34;Sydneigh&#34;?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** What do you mean?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lalahon:** Out of all the names you could have chosen, why choose that one?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** I mean... I had a cat back home that I named Meowster Chief. I had a dog a few years back named Bark Obama. I name my pets after puns.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hephaestus:** God... //Bark Obama?//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Chantico:** Okay, yeah, that&#39;s not something I can defend you for, that&#39;s just a bad name for a dog.
&gt; 
&gt; //PoI-418 laughs.//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** Listen, I have a naming convention and I stick to it. It&#39;s my thing!
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lalahon:** Oh, God...
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** Hey, you asked!
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lalahon:** I expected a cute answer, not a series of the worst puns I had ever heard.
&gt; 
&gt; //The team reaches the mouth of the cave. A few meters in front of them is a large, snaking river of molten halite. Agent Pele looks down and sees signs of significant tread along the shoreline of the river. She turns to PoI-418.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Pele:** 418, this place look familiar to you?
&gt; 
&gt; //PoI-418 looks at the river and shakes his head.//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** I&#39;m... I&#39;m not sure. I saw a few different rivers during my time here, or maybe it was the same one but it was super long. I didn&#39;t make a map, but... well, I didn&#39;t exactly have the materials to. Just a lot of apples and water. //Only// apples and water, really.
&gt; 
&gt; //PoI-418 laughs nervously.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Pele:** Well, if you see any landmarks that looks like they could lead us to where we need to be, feel free to shout them out. We might&#39;ve been around, but you&#39;ve been here a lot longer than any of us.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hephaestus:** Plus, it&#39;s //your// horse, after all.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** Right... yeah, yeah I can do that.
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Pele turns away. The team continues along the bank of the river.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hephaestus:** What are you even going to do with a horse, anyway? Can you ride horses?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** First thing I&#39;m doing when I get out is buying lessons.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Chantico:** You didn&#39;t ride her at all while you were in here?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** I was too scared that I would mess up and ride her straight into a river.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lalahon:** Isn&#39;t that how you died, though? The first time you were here, I mean.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** Not quite. I was walking //next// to her when a bridge caved out from under me. It was one of those natural ones, so it just crumbled, I think.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lalahon:** Jeez, that must&#39;ve been terrifying the first time.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Chantico:** Considering that you had no idea that you were going to come back after that.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** I mean... if you had asked me about it a couple of weeks ago, I&#39;d be a bit wary, but... I&#39;ve died, what, nine times now? I might just be a guy who works at Costco, but after the first few deaths, dying no longer really gets to you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Pele:** Good man. Surprised that a person like you could survive under the circumstances that you did, but I can respect it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hephaestus:** Yeah, there are other agents that haven&#39;t even died that many times. Shame that you&#39;re going to forget about that stuff or else you might make a decent agent yourself.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** Hey, that&#39;s... that&#39;s actually really nice of you to say, I think. Not sure what use I&#39;d be, considering my only really useful skill is diving. It&#39;s not even my main thing, that&#39;s just a hobby that I do on my vacation days.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Chantico:** You learn fast, which is something, at least. And you know, the whole not afraid of dying thing is something you might want should you ever get into situations like this.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** Well... I&#39;ll consider it! I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m exactly secret society material, but—
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Chantico:** It&#39;s okay! We&#39;re not going to pressure you into joining. Not everyone has the stomach for this stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lalahon:** Plus, the paperwork is almost enough to make you reconsider.
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Lalahon, Agent Chantico and Agent Hephaestus laugh.//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** Alright, alright. It&#39;s still nice for you all to offer, though.
&gt; 
&gt; //The team continues to walk along the riverbank until they come across a natural bridge of halite. In the distance are three pillars of halite, one partially collapsed.//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** Wait, I think... I think this is it.
&gt; 
&gt; //The team stops moving. Agent Pele turns towards PoI-418.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Pele:** You recognize this place?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** Yeah, yeah... yeah this is definitely... no, wait...
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Pele:** Something wrong, 418?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** I know those pillars and I know that bridge, just a few yards away is the reservoir, but...
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Hephaestus leans forward towards PoI-418.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hephaestus:** Is that the bridge that you fell off of?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** I didn&#39;t //fall off// that bridge, I told you. A chunk of it collapsed, I swear it did. I fell through the ground and into the river.
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Pele adjusts her camera to zoom in on the natural bridge. It is completely intact, no signs of any recent collapse or repair.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Pele:** You fell through //that// bridge, 418? You&#39;re absolutely certain?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Chantico:** I mean, you&#39;ve gone through a lot of stuff, died a lot, you know? Maybe you&#39;ve gotten some deaths mixed up?
&gt; 
&gt; //PoI-418 shakes his head.//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** I mean... I //swear// I fell through //that// bridge.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lalahon:** Well, the important thing is if you can find your horse from here.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** I mean... if this really is the bridge that I died on, I know how to get to the reservoir and I know how to get to the orchard. If Sydneigh&#39;s anywhere, she&#39;ll be at one of those places.
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Pele moves towards PoI-418 and takes him by the shoulder, moving him to the front.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Pele:** Then lead the way. We all have our dolls, so we&#39;ll be fine if something bad happens.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** A-alright... um, let&#39;s check the orchard first. It&#39;s by the pillar things, tucked in between them.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hephaestus:** Kind of a dangerous place to put a farm considering one of those things is collapsed, isn&#39;t it?
&gt; 
&gt; //PoI-418 shrugs.//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** I didn&#39;t build it.
&gt; 
&gt; //The team approaches the three halite pillars in the distance. Eventually, the apple orchard is approximately 20 meters away. PoI-418 slows down and then stops, leaning forward and putting his hands on his knees.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Pele:** There a problem, 418?
&gt; 
&gt; //PoI-418 does not respond. He then straightens out and breaks into a sprint.//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** I see her, I can //see// her! She&#39;s right there, look, you can see her!
&gt; 
&gt; //The team tries to keep pace with PoI-418 as he runs towards the destroyed pillar. As they get closer, they can see PoI-418-H obscured by the pillar, resting beneath one of the trees.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hephaestus:** Jesus, man, hold up! Gotta be careful around that thing!
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Pele:** 418, that structure does not look stable, try to tread lightly!
&gt; 
&gt; //PoI-418 takes off his mask and headgear, tossing them to the side. Agent Pele picks it up once she reaches them.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Pele:** 418, don&#39;t be rash, here, we can&#39;t afford to make a mistake!
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** Yes we can! If we fuck up we can come back! I&#39;m not letting this opportunity go to waste!
&gt; 
&gt; //PoI-418 reaches PoI-418-H and wraps his arms around her. PoI-418-H vocalizes.//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** Oh, Sydneigh, I knew I could see you again!
&gt; 
&gt; //PoI-418 kisses PoI-418-H on the snout.//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** Such a good girl, such a good horse. How&#39;ve you been?
&gt; 
&gt; //The rest of the team slows down and approaches the orchard and PoI-418-H with caution. Agent Pele tosses the mask and headgear to PoI-418.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Pele:** You&#39;re lucky that this air is breathable, 418. Not sure how that&#39;s possible considering the massive amount of volcanic degassing that should be occurring here...
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** I had to let her know it was me! We all look the same in the masks.
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Pele mumbles to herself.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Pele:** Not even sure how a //horse// could survive here...
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Pele, Agent Lalahon and Agent Chantico investigate the orchard.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lalahon:** Weird...
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Chantico:** Hey, I think the two of them are being sweet together.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lalahon:** I don&#39;t mean 418 and his horse, I mean the orchard.
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Lalahon gestures to one of the trees. Agent Pele turns toward it, showing that it is perfectly healthy. There are apples growing at an accelerated rate on every branch, and they seem to not have any abnormalities. Every few seconds, a single apple drops from the tree. The tree itself is not planted in any soil, but rather directly in the halite.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lalahon:** No dirt, it&#39;s just planted in the mineral itself. Can&#39;t see a source of water, either.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Chantico:** Maybe the horse cares for them? And if not that... magic?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lalahon:** I guess that&#39;s about as reasonable of an explanation as any, especially considering we&#39;re in a place that we travel to via voodoo doll.
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Lalahon shrugs.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lalahon:** I dunno. Pele, are you recording this?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Pele:** I have footage of the orchard, don&#39;t worry Lalahon. This is definitely something the researchers would be interested in, I feel.
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Hephaestus approaches PoI-418 and PoI-418-H.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hephaestus:** So this is her, then?
&gt; 
&gt; //PoI-418 looks up to Agent Hephaestus.//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** I could recognize the white spots on her anywhere.
&gt; 
&gt; //PoI-418-H vocalizes. PoI-418 laughs.//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** I think she recognizes me, too.
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Hephaestus looks up at the destroyed pillar of halite, carefully placing a hand on it.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hephaestus:** Kinda weird how she managed to survive so long. You said she was here before you were?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** Yeah, I mean... she has a solid supply of apples from these trees and a good source of water across the river, plenty of space to run...
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hephaestus:** I heard sometimes horses eat people to survive. Maybe that&#39;s why there aren&#39;t any?
&gt; 
&gt; //PoI-418 laughs nervously, then turns to Agent Hephaestus and swings at him with a fist. He misses, hitting the pillar, instead. The pillar groans loudly as it threatens to collapse further.//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** Shut up, that&#39;s probably just like a rumor or something.
&gt; 
&gt; //Chunks of halite break off of the pillar, falling towards Agent Hephaestus, PoI-418 and PoI-418-H.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hephaestus:** Listen, when you get back, before your memory gets wiped, read the story about a horse eating a Russian soldier. It&#39;s creepy but also kind of funny in a way?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Pele:** 418, Hephaestus, get out from under there!
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Hephaestus looks up and swiftly moves out of the way. PoI-418 looks over towards Agent Pele, confused.//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-418:** Wait, what&#39;s going on? Is there—
&gt; 
&gt; //Several large chunks of halite fall on top of PoI-418 and PoI-418-H. PoI-418 is crushed instantly, de-manifesting as expected. PoI-418-H is nowhere to be seen.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hephaestus:** Fucking Christ!
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Chantico:** Well, at least they were in contact, that should mean that Sydneigh&#39;s been extracted, right?
&gt; 
&gt; //PoI-418-H vocalizes.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lalahon:** ...Fuck.
&gt; 
&gt; //The remaining team members approach the rubble, looking for PoI-418-H. PoI-418-H is apparently occupying the same space as the rubble, vibrating violently as its limbs splay out in unnatural directions. It continues to vocalize, as if nothing strange is happening. The rubble around PoI-418-H is not reacting to any of its movements.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hephaestus:** What the //fuck//?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lalahon:** It&#39;s like a programming glitch...
&gt; 
&gt; //PoI-418-H becomes rigid, sticking its limbs out horizontally on either side of itself. It then instantly appears next to the rubble, standing and free of injury. It begins to walk towards the orchard and eats an apple that had fallen from the tree.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Pele:** I don&#39;t think it&#39;s //like// a glitch, Agent Lalahon.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lalahon:** What are you trying to imply?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Pele:** Oh, come on, you&#39;ve heard of anomalous simulations before. This is just a poorly created one, and whoever made it doesn&#39;t know how to properly make a landscape. Inaccuracies with the atmosphere, people falling through the floor, improper temperature gauges...
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Chantico:** ...So this whole place is just a program?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lalahon:** Is that horse just a part of it, then?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Pele:** Well, considering it didn&#39;t de-manifest or perish like people that come from outside of this place do, I would presume so.
&gt; 
&gt; //The team remains silent as they watch PoI-418-H consume more apples.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Chantico:** So... what do we do?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Pele:** Report this finding to the Foundation. They&#39;ll do with it what they need to.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hephaestus:** And 418? What do we even tell him?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Pele:** He volunteered to be amnesticized anyway. He won&#39;t care if we tell him his horse never existed.
&gt; 
&gt; //The team is once again silent as PoI-418-H walks away from the orchard, heading towards the natural bridge over the river.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lalahon:** Poor guy.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Pele:** Worse things could have happened. It&#39;s just a horse, anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Lalahon:** Yeah, but... he went through a lot to get her.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Pele:** It won&#39;t matter. He understood the risks and he understood that the mission might not have been successful. In fact, he helped us further our knowledge of this place because of that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hephaestus:** Don&#39;t think he was in it for the scientific discovery.
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Pele sighs.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Pele:** Let&#39;s just go. We can figure things out once we&#39;re back.
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Pele removes her firearm from her holster and aims it at her head. She fires.//
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**

After MTF-Epsilon 9 successfully left SCP-4111, they reported their findings to Foundation Researchers. PoI-418, who had been escorted from the testing premises after arriving prior to the rest of the Agents, was not informed of the true nature of SCP-4111 or PoI-418-H. 

PoI-418 is currently located in a Foundation-monitored neighborhood in █████, Washington. He is safe and has not[[footnote]]As of 12/13/20██.[[/footnote]] been approached by any other people with anomalous intent.
