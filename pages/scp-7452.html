**Item #:** SCP-7452

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7452 is to be kept in a basic 10^^2^^ m concrete cell furnished with basic human amenities. The cell should be guarded by at least two (2) security guards with Level 2 clearance and outfitted with basic firearms. In no circumstance should SCP-7452 be relinquished by its current D-Class &#34;host&#34; (SCP-7452-A), as doing so could result in [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Description:** SCP-7452 is a small gold sheet of foil approximately 1 cm x 1 cm in size. At first glance, it appears to be a non-anomalous object. However, if SCP-7452 were to be inspected from the side, it would seem to vanish. This is not merely an optical illusion. When viewing the object through an electron microscope, its gold atoms are only visible when viewing it from either of its faces. SCP-7452 does not pose any direct harm to humans.

SCP-7452 is immobile when in contact with a living human body. Despite its &#34;two-dimensional&#34; nature, any individuals who touch SCP-7452 do not experience any anomalous activity. However, whenever this condition is not met, SCP-7452 begins to move in a straight line toward [REDACTED], disregarding the presence of any objects that are in its way. It has been observed travelling at constant speeds ranging anywhere from five (5) to ten (10) kilometers per hour. The use of firearms, large objects, or any other means to slow down or stop SCP-7452&#39;s progress have been unsuccessful. When SCP-7452 reaches its destination, it has been observed to [DATA EXPUNGED]. This has occurred two (2) times since its initial containment.

To prevent the recurrence of containment breaches, a containment system was designed by Dr. Rutherford. Under threat of termination, a D-Class individual, known as the &#34;host,&#34; would be kept 24/7 in a cell created to prevent possible chance of escape by SCP-7452. The current host of SCP-7452 is SCP-7452-A.

Although unlikely, it is unknown whether SCP-7452 possesses any degree of sentience. Further research is required to learn about SCP-7452&#39;s possible uses, its &#34;two-dimensional&#34; properties, and possible connections to [[[SCP-085|other SCPs]]].

The discovery of SCP-7452 took place on █/██/20██ in front of a jewelry store in ██████████, ████████. Foundation agents in the area were alerted to its presence by a distressed shop owner chasing after a small gold sheet of foil traveling slowly across the ground. After questioning, it was determined that the piece of gold foil was donated to the shop owner by a &#34;mysterious individual&#34; dressed in gold. The shop owner was administered Class A amnestics, and the gold foil was obtained by the Foundation and subsequently dubbed SCP-7452.
