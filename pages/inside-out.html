 __**Report on &#34;SCP-17591&#34;**__
[[size 80%]]Published by J.S. Moulton Research Center, Bloomington, MN[[/size]]

**Section 1**
Pertinent information regarding SCP-17591

**I** 
SCP-17591 appears to be a clear rectangular block 2.5m x 1.5m x 1m in size. It is incredibly heavy — so much so that it cannot be removed safely from its original location. It is made of a material whose impenetrability and toughness has rendered it impossible to further scrutinize.

The item has been named SCP-17591 for an engraving on one of its sides containing the phrase, as well as a symbol associated with the defunct occultist group &#34;SCP Foundation&#34;, of which little information is available. The group associated this symbol with phenomena that were exceptionally dangerous and posed exceptional difficulties in the completion of their &#34;containment&#34; rituals.

**II**
SCP-17591 distorts local near-Euclidean space such that its six surfaces correspond with the walls, ceiling, and floor of the room where it resides — each point on the surface of the item is coterminous with a point on the walls of the room. SCP-17591 is effectively contained within its own inverted exterior.

For the sake of clarity, this text ignores the spacial warping aspect of SCP-17591 when referring to its location or containment, treating it as a discrete object. You may consult the Clarendon Report, Appendix C, for a full explanation of and technical details regarding Section 2-II.

**III**
SCP-17591&#39;s top surface (a 2.5m x 1.5m side), while fully translucent to cameras and other instruments, shows an image of some nonexistent place to those who observe it directly. The details of this place may vary in any aspect between viewers, including those who observe at the same time. Those cases most closely resembling reality usually show a region analogous to SCP-17591&#39;s location.

A recurring theme among the hallucinations induced by SCP-17591 is the sense that, from our point of view, the &#34;other side&#34; perceives our reality as though we existed within a box similar to SCP-17591. Attempts to communicate with the inhabitants of the hallucinatory places have resulted only in admonishments to &#34;exit&#34; or &#34;escape&#34;.

A sense of wanderlust, disdain for the present state of the world, and claustrophobic sentiments are inflicted upon those entering SCP-17591&#39;s room, and intensify during viewing of its top surface. All of those exposed have expressed the desire to escape the world as a whole, leaving by &#34;opening&#34; SCP-17591. It is unclear what this &#34;opening&#34; would entail, as the item has no observable seams or obvious means of opening it. Severity varies between those exposed, and dissipate with several hours away from SCP-17591.

These effects are produced and transmitted via telepathy emanating directly from SCP-17591, as confirmed by IAS psychic-sensitives T. McLean and E. Bell.

**Section 2**
Current status of SCP-17591

**I**
SCP-17591 remains at the location in which it first appeared -- the Site-83 Ruins near St. Paul, MN. It is in a former boiler room on the basement level. As this building was already under the exclusive purview of the International Anomaly Society (under the guise of an archaeological excavation), nothing else needed to be done to prevent access to the public.

**II**
SCP-17591 has not changed at all since its appearance.

**III**
Research on SCP-17591 has been discontinued. Contact S. Sanmugasunderam and M. O&#39;Cruadhlaoich at the J.S. Moulton Research Center with any questions regarding SCP-17591. See IAS Statement on the Suspected Nature of SCP-17591 and Related Protocols {{[attached]}}.

**__History of the International Anomaly Society&#39;s involvement with SCP-17591__**

----

SCP-17591 appeared on the third floor of the Site-83 ruins on 3221/07/31 and immediately fell through several floors to the basement. From the damage done to the rooms that it fell through, we have surmised that it was briefly coterminous with the walls of each of these rooms in the way that it is with the room it remains in.

A team sent from the J.S. Moulton Research Center reached the site within four hours and began research immediately. Research was terminated on 3224/08/19 and all personnel reassigned; we&#39;ve published this report prior to said reassignment.

The following document was found, heavily damaged, attached to SCP-17591&#39;s surface.
[[/=]]
&gt; Item: SCP-17591
&gt; Object Class: Keter
&gt; Date of Capture: 7/6/2455
&gt; Researcher-in-Charge: Dr. ████ B████

&gt; 
&gt; 8/7/2455 Escape attempts continue. Subversion of Site-███ personnel required termination of Dr. ██████ and Researcher ██████.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;report damaged&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; 2/7/2466 Escape imminent. Experimental Containment Procedure “T” to be implemented immediately. We believe the inhabitants of the receiving timeline lack the &lt;report damaged&gt; and have not for many years. &lt;report damaged&gt;sual stability, if true, will ensure long-term containment.

**__IAS Statement on the Suspected Nature of SCP-17591 and Related Protocols__**

----

The consensus among IAS researchers is that a being of some sort is trapped in or bound to SCP-17591 by the efforts of the SCP Foundation in the process of a &#34;containment ritual&#34;; while unable to escape itself, the being was able to psychically influence those around it to extract it via direct telepathic delivery of emotions and desires, hallucinatory imagery to focus these into a specific goal, and spacial distortion to lend credibility to the situation. Aware of the dangers posed by this being, the SCP Foundation decided to transport the item to our time-space locality, with the assumption that our total inability to penetrate SCP-17591 will prevent its release.

In light of this, no further research is to be performed with regard to SCP-17591. The site will be sealed off entirely should the means to open SCP-17591 be developed independently, with the Yucca Mountain protocol enacted to limit the possibility of the release of SCP-17591 in the distant future.

[[tab Editor&#39;s Note — Additional Documentation?]]
[This was filed under &#34;additional documentation for SCP-17591&#34;, but there was no paperwork with it, so I don&#39;t know where it came from, or where the rest of it is. Probably just a joke of some sort, but I&#39;m including it anyways:

I personally don&#39;t find it very funny.] - Editor
