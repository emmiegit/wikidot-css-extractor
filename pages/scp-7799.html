**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7799 is currently encircled and monitored by a multitude of Foundation outposts and military checkpoints that consistently survey SCP-7799 for any related anomalies or vehicles entering the external area of the territory nicknamed &#34;The Red Zone&#34;. If SCP-7799 expands past this zone, it is necessary to expand the &#34;Red Zone&#34; alongside it to keep full control of the area. This is to be exercised until SCP-7799-BRBB (Big Red Bouncy Ball) ceases to function and Foundation forces enter SCP-7799 to disassemble it in its entirety while incarcerating SCP-7799-1 in the process. As requested by the Ethics Committee[[footnote]]The Ethics Committee determines the most ethical option regarding Foundation-related issues.[[/footnote]], casualties involving synthetic civilians from SCP-7799 at the hands of Foundation forces are to be limited as much as possible unless directed otherwise.
 
Concerning SCP-7799-3, it is to be contained in an average humanoid containment cell in --Site-88 located in Baldwin County, Alabama--[[footnote]]Please see the second attached file for additional information.[[/footnote]] Site-228 located in Hungary.
 
The other half of SCP-7799-BRBB found by Foundation field agents in Döbling, Austria is to be contained in a small storage room in Site-19.

**Description:** SCP-7799 refers to a landlocked territory west of Langtry, Texas that is barricaded, patrolled, and militarized by SCP-7799-2 instances. It consists of multiple regions comparable to parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire during the twentieth century; however, it exhibits architecture that resembles 1980s American culture and technology, including desert geography. An example of this would be a region in SCP-7799 that mimics the capital city of the modern-day Czech Republic, Prague, which has been visually changed to adhere to this time frame. Additionally, SCP-7799 exhibits anomalous topography whereas, from the outside, SCP-7799 appears to be only 1,500 meters in length. Although upon entering, the territory becomes significantly immense and has been observed to be 621,538 km^^2^^ in size[[footnote]]This measurement appears to be similar in size to the historical Austro-Hungarian Empire at its peak in 1914.[[/footnote]]. SCP-7799 has not expanded its outside border or inward size further since its discovery. 
 
The area in question was created by SCP-7799-1 through a component of SCP-7799-BRBB, which was operated to construct a territory virtually identical to the Austro-Hungarian Empire during the twentieth century, the regions and cities that were within it, synthetic citizens to establish a society, and SCP-7799-2 instances to militarize and police the territory. Another entity, SCP-7799-3, in response to this action formed SCP-7799-4, a group of humanoid entities designed to withdraw SCP-7799-1&#39;s control over its piece of SCP-7799-BRBB. This has resulted in a large-scale armed conflict between SCP-7799-2 and SCP-7799-4 instances, causing significant damage to smaller towns and cities including numerous casualties to synthetic civilians.    
 
SCP-7799-BRBB is a red sphere that is approximately 8 meters tall and weighs 49 grams. It is bright red and hollowed on the inside to contain multiple copper pipes and aluminum cogs. These pipes and cogs appear to have no function or relevance to the machine, which is currently cut in half. One half is currently deactivated, whilst the other half is in use by SCP-7799-1.

**Descriptions, continued:**
 
[[tabview]]
[[tab SCP-7799-1]]
**SCP-7799-1** is a humanoid entity, resembling an adult male donning a uniform worn by Austrian emperors during the twentieth century and a sizeable lidless eyeball as a substitute for its head. Despite these physical attributes, SCP-7799-1 is capable of speaking German, Hungarian, and a variety of Balkan languages. It is responsible for creating the territory in question and the previously mentioned phenomena to proclaim itself as an &#34;emperor&#34; over it. The &#34;government&#34; of SCP-7799 is an autocracy controlled solely by SCP-7799-1, despite Austria-Hungary historically being a dual monarchy. 
 
SCP-7799-1&#39;s location within SCP-7799 is unknown, but it is suspected to be hiding beneath the territory in a secure bunker sending digital transmissions to SCP-7799-2 instances regarding the ongoing conflict or personal needs. Its only interactions with the outside have been national broadcasts and speeches to civilians. Additionally, it had past relations with SCP-7799-3 in creating SCP-7799-BRBB before both entities had any form of a feud.
[[/tab]]

[[tab SCP-7799-2]]
**SCP-7799-2** is an unknown number of humanoid entities created via SCP-7799-BRBB by SCP-7799-1, with three cognitive functions to police, combat SCP-7799-4 instances, and act as a &#34;military&#34; for SCP-7799. These entities are uniform in appearance, donning Austro-Hungarian military uniforms seen during World War One and a large digital camera in replacement of their heads. These entities are capable of speaking German, Hungarian and different Balkan languages. Additionally, instances can take photographs with their camera to share with nearby SCP-7799-2 instances to communicate on the battlefield.

SCP-7799-2 instances have access to an extensive stockpile of military equipment at their disposal, such as tanks, a variety of aircraft, armored vehicles, and self-propelled artillery, in addition to M16 rifles and multi-tool pocketknives equipped alongside each instance. Despite this, most equipment used by SCP-7799-2 was made by Soviet manufacturers during the 1980s and are prone to malfunctions due to SCP-7799-2&#39;s guache unprofessionalism and limited knowledge of operating such technology, which results in instances of fratricide at times. In addition to this, SCP-7799-2 instances off-duty consume copious quantities of Diet Pepsi brand soda or dance to music released from 1977-1999 to boost their endurance against bodily harm.
[[/tab]]

[[tab SCP-7799-3]]
**SCP-7799-3** is a humanoid entity, resembling an adult male donning a black trenchcoat and a considerable yellow spherical, motionless smiley face as a substitute for its head. Despite these features, SCP-7799-2 is capable of fluently speaking German, Hungarian, and different Balkan languages including English. SCP-7799-3 is responsible for forming and leading SCP-7799-4 to halt SCP-7799-1&#39;s control over SCP-7799-BRBB after intricacies between the two entities. 
 
It was contained on November 21st of 2018 by Foundation field agents investigating outside of SCP-7799 at its initial discovery, where it was belligerent during capture until subdued when taken to nearby Site-73 for interrogation regarding SCP-7799 and its familiarity of it, before being taken to Site-88. After Incident-Site-88 on December 21st, 2018, SCP-7799-3 was escorted to Site-228 located in Hungary.
[[/tab]]
[[tab SCP-7799-4]]
**SCP-7799-4** is a collection of over 3,000 humanoid entities exhibiting precise head topography to SCP-7799-3 and donning makeshift military uniforms. These instances reside within dispersed hideouts throughout SCP-7799 and act as an armed insurgency attempting to gain control of SCP-7799-BRBB through guerilla warfare against SCP-7799-2 instances. It is noted that SCP-7799-4 instances engage in irregular activities similar to SCP-7799-2 instances.

Before the Foundation &#34;Red Zone&#34; surrounding SCP-7799 was successfully enforced, knowledge of SCP-7799 during its initial discovery was inadequate and project directors were uncertain of how to regulate the situation due to the destructive capabilities of such an anomaly. SCP-7799-3 was contained at this time, however, the armed conflict continued.
 
A multitude of drones was sent out to observe and document the territory in its entirety, including areas where clashes between SCP-7799-2 and SCP-7799-4 instances were prominent. 
 
The following file showcases events of interest. Portions of this file have been roughly translated from German, Hungarian, and Balkan languages and shortened for brevity.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
3:32 pm - November 29th - 2018 - City resembling Lviv from Ukraine 
 
A largely popular &#34;gentlemen&#39;s club&#34; is seen being surrounded by armored vehicles as heavily equipped SCP-7799-2 instances exit out the back doors. The sides of these vehicles appear to have a logo consisting of the Vatican City&#39;s coat of arms with white text written below in a variety of languages displaying &#34;E.O.C.T: Enforcement Of Catholic Traditions&#34;. 
 
SCP-7799-2 instances begin to launch tear gas into the building, as multiple instances rush inside to open fire at random, directed at the ceiling. Nearly all the clubs&#39; occupants and staff members were arrested and accompanied to the back doors of the previously mentioned armored vehicles. A Catholic priest is seen praying over the detainees as they are shoved into the back of the vehicles.

2:21 am - November 30th - 2018 - City resembling Zagreb from Croatia.
 
Multiple SCP-7799-4 instances defile and pull down a statue of SCP-7799-1 located in a park before fleeing. The next morning, a large commercial-sized building nearby that had been a hiding spot for SCP-7799-4 instances was pulled down violently. 
 
SCP-7799-1 had sent a digital transmission hours before the event to nearby SCP-7799-2 instances personally requesting the destruction of a dubious building suspected to be an area for SCP-7799-4 instances to hide within. Specifically, to pull it down via ropes.
 
The event garnered numerous civilian casualties and very limited SCP-7799-4 instances were harmed.

5:45 pm - December 1st - 2018 - City resembling Prague from the Czech Republic
 
An inexplicit event took place during the forenoon hours in a city resembling Prague from the Czech Republic, in which twenty men outfitted in prison uniforms with potato sacks over their heads were led out by SCP-7799-2 instances into the center of an empty football field to be lined up. 
 
Four different SCP-7799-2 instances are at each corner of the football field while dressed in &#34;Santa Clause&#34; costumes armed with machine guns. The song &#34;How Will I Know&#34; by the musical artist Whitney Houston begins to play on the stadium speakers as SCP-7799-2 instances open fire on the men. The men scramble across the field before all twenty were killed.

7:14 pm - December 2st - 2018 - Region resembling Transylvania from Romania
  
Several 1985 Soviet RT-2PM Topols[[footnote]]The RT-2PM Topol is a mobile ballistic missile launcher.[[/footnote]] driven by SCP-7799-2 instances are seen traversing down a dirt path before entering a small bunker. 
 
Although this footage has been debated amongst SCP-7799 project directors regarding its authenticity due to the video&#39;s unusual inclination and height, a nuclear incident involving SCP-7799 with proposed protocols has been drafted by ███████████[[footnote]]Due to some level three personnel who may be viewing this file being in no position to view heavily classified groups or individuals, this has been censored.[[/footnote]] and will be de-classified to appropriate personnel if such a scenario were to occur.

12:21 pm - December 3rd - 2018 - Unspecified SCP-7799-4 controlled town
 
Thrity SCP-7799-4 instances have set up multiple barricades and military checkpoints to fortify a small town and prepare for a siege from SCP-7799-2 instances. 
 
Considerable amounts of SCP-7799-2 instances piloting helicopters and fighter jets approach the town as SCP-7799-4 instances run for cover expecting heavy fire, unprepared for such an attack. 
 
However, ample amounts of white phosphorus munitions are constantly dropped on the rivaling instances and hiding civilians causing a mass panic resulting in the attack becoming more efficacious in the favor of SCP-7799-2 instances.
 
As SCP-7799-4 instances are wiped out by dropped fighter jet bombs, helicopters lower themselves to drop additional phosphorus bombs on fleeing civilians, while the 1987 song &#34;Criticize&#34; by the musical artist Alexander O&#39;Neal plays over attached speakers. 
 
Once all observable SCP-7799-4 instances were eradicated, the town completely ignited, and civilians killed off or suffering from severe burns, SCP-7799-2 instances enter the town on foot to loot bodies and houses. They raise the Austro-Hungarian flag before retreating.

4:12 pm - December 7th - 2018 - City resembling Budapest from Hungary
 
An extensive rabble of civilians is seen igniting businesses and homes while physically attacking select victims. 
 
Some Rioters are waving Austro-Hungarian flags and holding signs that roughly translate to slogans such as &#34;Get the simpletons out!&#34;, &#34;Satan is not welcome here!&#34;, and &#34;Run away non-believers!&#34; It is noted that SCP-7799-2 instances are onlooking at the event in a casual manner, momentarily stopping conversations between one another to push fleeing victims back into the crowd or physically hurt them themselves. 
 
In one observation, a young man is seen fleeing from rioters and rushing into a nearby pond, where rioters follow to subsequentially drown him. 
 
In a similar manner, another man is tied by his arms and legs while held up by SCP-7799-2 instances before being tossed into the aforementioned pond. SCP-7799-2 instances fire multiple rounds into the man after tossing him in as rioters cheer and throw consumed Diet Pepsi bottles at his floating corpse.

10:27 am - December 8th - 2018 - City resembling Sarajevo from Bosnia and Herzegovina
 
An event occurred in which SCP-7799-4 instances had stormed multiple catholic churches killing men, women, and children during Sunday service. Nearby SCP-7799-2 instances engage the rivaling entities, however, they are overrun. 
 
SCP-7799-1 in response to this sends out a digital transmission requesting multiple airstrikes on the city. Three minutes after this ultimatum, two long-range missiles hit SCP-7799-4 positions without hesitation, causing severe damage to infrastructure and civilian life.

All SCP-7799-4 instances were eradicated from the area, with surviving instances retreating to covert shelters. SCP-7799-4 instances in insurgent-controlled areas send three long-range missiles to a city resembling Zadar from Croatia in response to the attack, causing significantly more substantial damage and civilian casualties. Long-range strikes between the two sides lasted for an additional thirty minutes before ending.

//Foundation drones onlook an ongoing military parade attended by thousands of civilians. The parade takes place in a town square overlooked by an enormous portrait of SCP-7799-1 hanging from a parliamentary building, in a comparable vein to Tiananmen Square located in Beijing, China.//
 
//The military parade below exhibits a multitude of SCP-7799-2 instances driving various 1980s Soviet and Chinese military vehicles and aircraft such as tanks, armored personnel carriers, ballistic missile launchers, artillery trucks, including an aircraft flyover of various interceptors and attack jets. The parade itself is accompanied by the Austro-Hungarian national anthem.//
 
//After an hour, SCP-7799-1 arrives into view on top of a large stage with multiple armed SCP-7799-2 instances escorting it. Special effects and fireworks go off, illuminated by different colored lights while the song &#34;Whenever You Need Somebody&#34; by the musical artist Rick Astley plays on loudspeakers. SCP-7799-2 instances spray Diet Pepsi into the cheering crowd via a fire hose. SCP-7799-1 begins to speak after a short dance.//
 
**SCP-7799-1:** It is a wonderful day today, and Christmas is on the rise over Austria! I wish to give a grand merry Christmas to my Austrian brethren, the Hungarians to the east, the Germans, the Slovenians, the Slovakians, the Czechs, Ukrainians, Serbs, Italians, Poles, Ruthenians, Croats, Ladins, Bosnians, and Herzegovinians! 
 
//The crowd erupts into cheers.//
 
**SCP-7799-1:** On a serious note, however... I have witnessed the tragedies that occurred sometime before this very celebration, and I fought back with full force, making it another victory for our nation against those smirking monstrosities we all loath and abhor so much unanimously...[[footnote]]This statement is false.[[/footnote]]
 
//There is murmuring amongst the crowd.//
 
**SCP-7799-1:** They attacked us where it was personal. Storming our churches during lectures... Cowards they were. But do not fret, as we saved more people and lost none, even eliminated them from Sarajevo completely![[footnote]]This statement is also false.[[/footnote]] The wrath of our nation, the wrath of god, will catch up with them very soon I tell you. 
 
//The crowd cheers again.//
 
**SCP-7799-1:** In my infinite wisdom and knowledge, it has also come to my attention that the grotesque hell-spawn known as &#34;Administrator X&#34; has been kidnapped and possibly killed by an unknown third-party source. And as we speak, I have ordered the dispatch of multiple troops to find Administrator X to find him alive, and fetch him back so we may roast his body over a live fire, to deliver him an appetizer for hell. 
 
//The crowd cheers once more.//
 
**SCP-7799-1:** We have a good estimation of his current location outside of our borders, and I promise that this night will be a night to remember for the ages. I, Kaiser Valentin Konstantin, promise you this. Do not expect this to be the end of our nightly celebration tonight!  
 
//The crowd cheers one last time as SCP-7799-1 exits off stage while SCP-7799-2 instances fire t-shirt canons at the crowd. Foundation drones latch to the outside wall of the backstage department and listen to a conversation between SCP-7799-1 and SCP-7799-2 instances while Site-88 which currently held SCP-7799-3 at the time, was given an emergency message instructing the immediate evacuation of SCP-7799-3 to a 
better-secluded containment site. The limited Foundation forces at the &#34;Red Zone&#34; were instructed to go on high alert.//
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Tell me, are those troops at that power plant place? 
 
**SCP-7799-2 instance:** Soon, my lord. We have already received transmissions stating that the site is in far view.
 
**SCP-7799-1:** They took the tunnels to leave, yes?
 
**SCP-7799-2 instance:** Affrimative, my lord. 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** //(Sigh)// I am in disbelief that we must leave outside our own borders like rats once those glass-faced Englishmen began amassing around our desert. If they truly wish to participate in a war that they hold no knowledge of, then so be it. I have faith that our lord in heaven, Jesus Christ, will guide my decisions in these dangerous and trying times, as well as assist you in your aim during battle. 
 
**SCP-7799-2 instances:** Thank you, my lord. 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** I request an escort back to my comfy bunker immediately. Now, what to do in the meantime as we wait for our future guest...
 
**SCP-7799-2 instance:** Perhaps we should discuss the economic and architectural damage of the ongoing war so far? 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Horrible idea! You? 
 
**Other SCP-7799-2 instance:**  Perhaps we can have a water gun fight again back in the bunker. 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Agreed. We&#39;ll start that first thing back at home. 
[[/div]]
 
Site-88 at this time received the previously mentioned emergency message and began to organize an escort for SCP-7799-3 to be moved into a nearby secure facility further away from SCP-7799.  
 
The following log is a collection of surveillance footage, and radio transmissions at the Foundation &#34;Red Zone&#34; and Site-88 to describe the events that ensued afterward.
 
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
9:36 pm - December 11th - 2018
 
//At the Foundation &#34;Red Zone&#34; surrounding SCP-7799, Foundation forces have maintained a state of high alert expecting a brigade of SCP-7799-2 instances, however, the expected event does not occur.// 
 
//This is due to the actuality that SCP-7799-2 instances have taken an underground tunnel beneath the &#34;Red Zone&#34; that stretches to Langtry, Texas to the east of SCP-7799. Due to the limited surveillance within Langtry at the time because of its remote location, SCP-7799-2 instances exited the tunnel undetected by Foundation forces and anomalously reached Site-88 in Baldwin County, Alabama within ten minutes. This was unanticipated as SCP-7799-2 instances have not exhibited this phenomenon before or after this event ever again.//
 
//The armored escort is seen exiting the lower levels of the Baldwin County Nuclear Power Plant out of a storage garage, and stopping at the security booth. There is a miscommunication, causing the escort to remain stationary at the security booth for an additional eight minutes. SCP-7799-3 is in an armored van, with multiple armed guards sitting across from it. It is handcuffed and wearing a spare D-Class jumpsuit hastily put onto it before the escort began.// 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Hey. You... Where the hell are we going? 
 
**Guard to the left:** A better question is if you&#39;ll shut the fuck up already. //(The other armed guards in the van laugh).// 
 
**Guard to the right:** Can you gag him or something? I&#39;m sick and tired of listening to this guy.
 
**Guard in the center:** I tried, but I have no idea where this thing&#39;s mouth is. 
 
**Guard to the right:** I&#39;m getting pissed off at this guy, he keeps smiling at me. 
 
**Guard to the left:** It&#39;s always smiling. The doctors said it was &#34;motionless head topography&#34; or some shit. 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Listen here, I&#39;m an experienced military leader and a man of the sciences. I think it would be in good favor to hear what I&#39;m telling you right now.
 
**Guard in the center:** I think it would be in good favor for you to be quiet or I&#39;ll beat the shit out of you. 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Listen to me, if I can&#39;t lead my men to victory they&#39;ll eventually die out! They need my leadership! I must get back to the battlefield! We can make a truce, a cease-fire just between the two of us-
 
//The guard to the left hits SCP-7799-3 with the butt of his rifle twice.//
 
**Guard to the left:** That&#39;s what I think of your truce bud! Now be quiet because there&#39;s more where that came from! 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** You&#39;re not listening to me! If my friend Konstantin has a hold of our red ball then he&#39;ll just get stronger! You need to listen to what I&#39;m saying assholes!
 
**Guard in the center:** What is he talking about? 
 
**Guard to the right:** Ignore his ass. He&#39;s just complaining and shit. 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** That red ball is the future of medicine! Not war! Konstantin is- 
 
//The guard to the left hits SCP-7799-3 with the butt of his rifle four times.//
 
**Guard to the left:**  I said, be quiet!
 
**Guard to the right:** What&#39;s taking so long, why aren&#39;t we moving? 
 
**Guard in the center:** I have no idea, man. 
 
//The escort begins to move onto the highway before taking a left turn down the road.   A group of armored trucks driven by SCP-7799-2 instances is seen speeding down the highway, however, are not yet seen by the convoy.//
 
//One of the trucks hit the armored van in a t-bone wreck, causing the van to roll onto its side as the rest of the convoy exits their vehicles to open fire on the rest of the oncoming SCP-7799-2 instances. A considerable fire-fight occurs as nearby Site-88 and the Baldwin County Nuclear Power Plant go into lockdown.//   
 
**Guard to the left:** Shit! What the fuck happened?! 
 
**Guard to the right:** The van is on its side! We gotta get out! 
 
**Guard in the center:** Shit! My fucking arm man! What the hell?! 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** W-what&#39;s going on?! What happened?!
 
**Guard to the right:** Make sure he&#39;s still cuffed when we get out so he doesn&#39;t run off or something! 
 
//Multiple SCP-7799-2 instances tear off the back doors of the armored van and open fire on the three guards incapacitating them as SCP-7799-3 quickly flees back to the Site-88 parking lot. SCP-7799-2 instances shoot its legs after a short chase, incapacitating it as well. The nearby security booth surveillance camera captures a brief exchange between the entities.//
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Shit! My fucking legs... No... //(SCP-7799-3 begins to shriek in pain).// 
 
**SCP-7799-2 instances:** Take the Administrator X. Take him back to base as soon as possible.
 
**Other SCP-7799-2 instance:** Affirmative. 
 
**SCP-7799-2 instance:** What about the rest of these glass-faced Englishmen? Are they dealt with properly? 
 
**Other SCP-7799-2 instance:** They laid down their arms. It is necessary that we leave immediately.
 
//One of the instances drags SCP-7799-3 by its injured legs causing it to shriek in pain.// 
 
//Multiple SCP-7799-4 instances leap from the corner and massacre numerous SCP-7799-2 instances, leaving two left that hold SCP-7799-3.//
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Oh my god! My men! You came for me! Free me from the clutches of these photographic monstrosities!
 
**SCP-7799-4 instances:** Let go of the Administrator X, or we&#39;ll unleash hell on your asses! The rest of your brigade is dead! Dead I tell you! 
 
//Tactical response officers turn the corner of the security booth and focus on both entities.//
 
**Tactical response officer:** Freeze, all of you! Release the asset or overwhelming retaliation will be initiated!
 
**SCP-7799-2 instance:** The glass-faced Englishmen! 
 
**SCP-7799-4 instance:**  All of you back off! He&#39;s ours for the taking! 
 
**Tactical response officer:** We won&#39;t repeat ourselves again! Surrender and release the asset! 
 
//A moment of silence.// 
 
**SCP-7799-2 instance:** Okay, okay! We all wish to obtain this sniveling slime ball we all know as &#34;Administrator X&#34;! 
 
**SCP-7799-4:** No he&#39;s not! //(Other instance in the crowd):// Yeah! 
 
**SCP-7799-2:** If we all wish to obtain him, then what are we to do in this unusual predicament? That&#39;s a question we should all ask ourselves! 
 
**SCP-7799-4 instance:** What are you trying to say? 
 
//Tactical response officers are seen aiming at the two SCP-7799-2 instances prepared to open fire.// 
 
**SCP-7799-2 instance:** //(It begins to gesture unusually with its arms and contorts its body in random directions as it speaks, moving its hands in and out of its pockets).// I mean, what should we ever do in this situation? It is such a shame that it had come to this, as we all stand face to face with the entity we all hide from known as death! I mean, anything could happen at any moment to us because of how unnatural this situation is! And to solve this situation, I will hand over the Administrator X to these glass-faced Englishmen! //(It points to the tactical response officers as its hand is stuffed in its pocket. A small pin falls to the ground, however, is not detected).// Take him! //(He lets go of SCP-7799-3. The tactical response officers lower their weapons slightly).// 
 
**SCP-7799-4 instance:** What?! 
 
**SCP-7799-2 instance:** Take him! Go ahead and-
 
//The SCP-7799-2 instance abruptly stops and tosses a grenade into the crowd of tactical response officers, causing an immense riot to transpire in which SCP-7799-2 and SCP-7799-4 instances fall on top of one another and fire their weapons randomly at rivaling groups. Some tactical response officers accidentally fall to the ground while others fire their weapons into the crowd of SCP-7799-4 instances. The two SCP-7799-2 instances quickly grab SCP-7799-3 and dive into the nearby security booth to the left of them as the grenade detonates, killing four tactical response officers.//
 
**Radio transmission to officers:** What the hell is going on out there?! Have you gotten a hold of the object?! 
 
**Tactical response officer:** One of the instances flung a hand grenade! We&#39;re all scrambled now! 
 
**Radio transmission to officers:** Do you know where SCP-7799-3 is?! Do you have a hold of him?! 
 
**Tactical response officer:** There&#39;s like, twenty of these smiley-face guys I don&#39;t even know which one it is! 
 
**Radio transmission to officers:** It has an orange jumpsuit, do you see him?! 
 
**Tactical response officer:** I think I do! But I need more backup! There&#39;s a massive fucking shoot-out here man! I have no idea where my team is! 
 
//Back-up is sent to quell the fighting as a helicopter piloted by SCP-7799-4 instances lowers itself dangerously to the ground of the parking lot as one of the instances leans off the edge and opens fire at arriving SCP-7799-2 instances.// 
 
//The SCP-7799-2 instances ahold of SCP-7799-3 attempt to run across the parking lot away from the combat before being killed by SCP-7799-4 gunfire. SCP-7799-3 is hiding behind a parked vehicle.//
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Shit... Shit... What the hell, man... 
 
//The previously mentioned helicopter hovers low over the ground towards SCP-7799-3, and an SCP-7799-4 instance leans out one of the open sides outstretching its hand.//  
 
**SCP-7799-4 instance:** Grab my hand! Let&#39;s get you out of here! 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Oh god! Thank you! I am finally free! Get me out of here!  
 
//SCP-7799-3 grabs onto the helicopter landing skids and attempts to grab the SCP-7799-4 instance&#39;s hand as the helicopter gains slight amounts of altitude. Tactical response officers focus fire on the rising helicopter, causing substantial damage to it. SCP-7799-3 falls to the ground from twelve meters resulting in numerous injuries.// 
 
**Tactical response officer:** Don&#39;t move! Don&#39;t move! 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** My bones are shattered you fucking fool! I can&#39;t move! I hate you all! All of you! 
 
//The helicopter continues to gain altitude, until losing complete control and collides with the western end of the parking lot crushing a vehicle in the process. The remaining SCP-7799-2 and SCP-7799-4 instances are killed off, and the combat ends.//
 
//SCP-7799-3 was given medical attention as it was transported to Site-228 overseas located in Hungary four days later.//
 
//A digital transmission was intercepted at this time from SCP-7799 to seized SCP-7799-2 radio sets. The following is the aforementioned transmission.//
 
&gt; Disappointment I tell you! Disappointment! And you! Stop spraying water on me I&#39;m not in the mood anymore! //(SCP-7799-1 is heard drinking a beverage).// This is ignorance at the highest level! I am in disbelief that you couldn&#39;t manage to bring back the Administrator X! 
&gt; 
&gt; I promised my people that I would bring him back! What the hell am I supposed to do now?! I guess I could burn an effigy or something, but I would have preferred to have Administrator X to be burned instead! All of you, return to base for demotions now! If any of you are still alive out there! 
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, Jesus and Mary. I need some more of that Pepsi elixir. And turn off the music! I need a moment by myself...//(sigh)// I need to just relax for tonight. No speeches tomorrow, no war-mongering, I just want to sit down and watch... How It&#39;s Made. Yes, that&#39;s what I&#39;ll do. And maybe do some more missile strikes tomorrow morning.

The incident itself generated over $120,000 in damages and the death of five Site-88 tactical response officers. Including seven severe casualties and three minor injuries.
 
Although there have been no future events mimicking the incident described in this file, the Foundation &#34;Red Zone&#34; surrounding SCP-7799 has since been finalized and strengthened to reassure confidence in such an event never occurring similarly. Additionally, underground tunnels beneath Langtry have been demolished by Foundation field agents during various construction projects.

The following file illustrates an interrogation between Doctor Vladimir Yusuf and SCP-7799-3 four days after an incident took place at Site-88 located in Baldwin County, Alabama (See the previous file for more information). Doctor Yusuf will ask SCP-7799-3 a series of questions regarding SCP-7799, and how it came to fruition. Note that Doctor Yusuf refers to SCP-7799-3 throughout the interview as &#34;X&#34;. 
 
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
 
7:10 pm - December 15th - 2018
 
//Doctor Vladimir Yusuf sits at a foldable table, with SCP-7799-3&#39;s seat across from him. The room has a surveillance camera observing the room, with SCP-7799 project directors viewing the interrogation from said surveillance.//
 
//SCP-7799-3 is led into the room by armed guards and is sat down across from Doctor Yusuf. SCP-7799-3 is wrapped in multiple casts and bandages after the previous incident, and Dr. Yusuf pulls out a stack of binders. Dr. Yusuf opens his binders to pull out a sheet of questions and data papers, while SCP-7799-3 is seen fondling with a pen.//
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** Good morning. My name is Doctor Vladimir Yusuf, but you can just call me Yusuf for today... Okay? 
 
//No response from SCP-7799-3.//
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** Okay? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Yeah, yeah, sure. 
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** I don&#39;t like your tone. 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Listen I get why I&#39;m here, this whole movie-like interrogation shit you got going on here so I&#39;ll just give it to you straight. Me and Konstantin got pissed off because I took half the red ball and ran off to Budapest and he makes his own possie and shit so I had to make my own and then there&#39;s a big shit storm and-
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** E-excuse me? What are you talking about? And you&#39;re not allowed to speak back unless asked to, got it? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** I&#39;m trying to get this over as soon as possible, doc. 
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** Well, you&#39;re going to be here for a while so sit your ass down and be silent unless spoken to, got it? 
 
//SCP-7799-3 gestures sarcastically at Dr. Yusuf and continues to fidget with the pen.//
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** Now, tell me. What name are you comfortable with for brevity? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** I am the Administrator X.
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** How about just &#34;X&#34; okay? 
 
**SCP-7799:** Fine.
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** What exactly were you doing in this, &#34;territory&#34; shall we say? Why did this conflict begin? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Hold on, if I tell you all of this, will you guarantee my freedom out of here, so I may return to the battlefield? 
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** I cannot confirm that. 
 
//A moment of silence. SCP-7799-3 leans in and uses the pen it holds to gesture with it whilst it speaks throughout the rest of the interview.//
 
**SCP-7799-3:** So, why should I tell you then?
 
//Dr. Yusuf appears visibly frustrated.//
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** I just have a few simple questions that expect a logical reply from you, X. If you refuse to answer, then we can just lock you away in a dark cell for the rest of your miserable life. Have I made myself clear? 
 
//SCP-7799-3 is silent for a moment.//
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Fine. That&#39;s okay. What are these &#34;simple questions&#34; you keep pestering me about? 
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** For starters, how did this little battle start? 
 
//SCP-7799-3 leans in.// 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Doc, &#34;little&#34; is an understatement. Maybe from the podium you white-coated scientists stand on, it could appear &#34;little&#34; to you. You are not a part of it. You were never a part of it. Now, you amass at the border, acting like you are partaking in this war.
 
The war has caused much damage to my psyche. All of it stemmed from a dumbass decision I made decades ago and now it&#39;s come back to bite me in //my// ass. I&#39;ve endured much throughout this war. It doesn&#39;t make sense. War never does. So don&#39;t come at me with &#34;little&#34; okay?
 
//A moment of silence.//       
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** Okay then. My apologies X. How did this war start? 
 
//SCP-7799-3 leans back in a leisurely fashion. And continues to point with its pen as it speaks.// 
 
**SCP-7799-3:**  1981. Graduation year. Me and Veletin were nominated best in the class for engineering and graduated with a Doctorate degree.
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** Hold on... Who is Valentin? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** He&#39;s the &#34;Emporer of the Austrian Empire&#34; or some shit. Does that ring any bells?
 
//Dr. Yusuf looks through some files and pulls out SCP-7799-1&#39;s document and pushes it toward SCP-7799-3.//
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** Is this your &#34;Valentin&#34; you speak of? 
 
//SCP-7799-3 skims through the document.//
 
**SCP-7799-3:** //(Pointing to the attached photograph of SCP-7799-1).// Yes. That is him!
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** So, you knew this thing personally. 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** He was a friend. A good friend who always had my back. It&#39;s not really like that anymore but, I know who he is. 
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** Okay, continue.  
 
**SCP-7799-3:** And not just friends, we were partners in science. We worked together in a small lab in Vienna after I moved in with him to work on our first projects. And we made some good stuff before The Big Red Bouncy Ball, like knockoff Pong machines!
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** Big red what?
 
**SCP-7799-3;** The Big Red Bouncy Ball! It was our greatest invention! After we graduated from college and became engineers, we went to work on an ambitious project, one that would make machines at will! One that could make machines that were more than just machines! A machine for machines!
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** I... Don&#39;t fully understand what this Big Red Bouncy Ball thing is.
 
**SCP-7799-3:** It makes machines, doc.
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** What kind of machines exactly?
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Oh anything! Or at least... It used to. Now that the Big Red Bouncy Ball is cut in half, it&#39;s very limited in what it can do.
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** What do you mean by that?
 
**SCP-7799-3:** I&#39;ll explain in a minute. But first, let me tell you something about our creation. When me and Valentin worked on it, we slowly started to realize that this machine was capable of more than just making basic gizmos. It could create life in a way. Or at least, a very good imitation of life. Like an imposter of organic nature, unsure of how to act like life, but has an idea.
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** I don&#39;t think I need to know this. So, it&#39;s somewhat good at creating life? Okay. tell me when you finish making it.
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Took us eight years to just finish the damn thing. I remember those sleepless nights just straining ourselves into oblivion and madness. Me and Valentin would lash out at each other all the time and awkwardly apologize for it in the morning. An almost endless cycle. I remember Konstantin would deal with the stress through some of his infamous ramblings about the great empires of the past. &#34;Re-unification&#34; and &#34;revival&#34; were phrases he used a lot. I never took him seriously about it. But now, I wish I did.
 
 **Dr. Yusuf:** You&#39;re off-topic, X. Just tell me what happened after you finished the machine.
 
**SCP-7799-3:** My bad. Uh... yeah. the testing years. Went on for a lot longer than it should have but we made some good memories... Seeing the results of this machine, I was hopeful for the future. I thought of all the medicinal purposes this could have... And how rich I would be. I could charge people for &#34;miracle medicine&#34; or something. I mean, would you be willing to pay your life savings to save your family from sickness or something? Hah! It&#39;s the perfect cash cow.
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** X... Please stay on track.
 
**SCP-7799:** But Konstantin, he was keen on using it for... Other things you could say. Like, weapons of mass destruction, hellish entities loyal to only his name, and all kinds of interesting things.
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** These entities and weapons didn&#39;t hurt anybody, did they?
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Of course not. We would dispose of them after testing so nothing would get loose. At least... I hope nothing got loose.
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** We can deal with that later. So, both of you wanted to do different things with this Big Red Bouncy Ball... Which could make many types of creations but is currently cut in half, so it can still sort of do what it does but is limited. God, this is ridiculous. How did it get cut in half?
 
**SCP-7799-3:** We couldn&#39;t really agree on what to do with it because if one option was put to fruition, one of us couldn&#39;t do what we wanted to do with it... So I just said fuck it and took half of it for myself.
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** Really now?
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Yes! I cut it in half, left a note, and went back to my home in Hungary. I settled down in a nice house in my home city Budapest and decided that I would work on medicine for the rest of my life, hoping to get a pharmaceutical business started.
 
That pissed off Valentin. Like, a lot. Our friendship was already paling, so thought he would get the message you know? I use my part for what I want and he would use his part for what he wants. But I guess he didn&#39;t like that idea.
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** And... How is this related?
 
**SCP-7799:** Listen. I wake up one morning and there&#39;s a bunch of camera-headed soldiers outside my house demanding I come out. Valentin was there, too. He came on the megaphone and told me to hand over the other piece of the machine or he&#39;ll, you know. I thought I was fucked.
 
Then, I remembered that I had a machine for machines! Instead of medicine, I made my own like-minded intelligent soldiers. My neighborhood soon became a battleground between our two armies, and we watched anxiously waiting for a victor. It was a draw... Valentin and his men retreated back to Austria shortly after the fighting was long overdue. I made as many men as I could before my part of the machine broke, and followed after him. Battles came and went...And we somehow ended up here in Langtry, and he decided to stop there and make his own mock-up of the Austro-Hungarian empire for some stupid ass reason.
 
Many war crimes and years fighting in a wanna-be nation later, here I am. And that was the story of my life. There. Are you happy now? Am I going to get an oscar or some shit now? 
 
//Dr. Yusuf sighs and cleans off his glasses before recollecting himself. He writes down several notes before speaking again.// 
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** Okay... So. The two of you made a &#34;bouncy red ball&#34; contraption...
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Big Red Bouncy Ball. 
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** And this mechanism could create complex organisms, but not anymore because you took half of it for yourself...
 
**SCP-7799-3:** It can still make complex organisms but not as complex anymore. It depends on what you&#39;re making. If it&#39;s already something defined in nature it works pretty well, but something unique from that is a little rough when it comes out.
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** Okay? And this spirals into a small posse battle, then balloons into a full-scale war in the Texan desert? In which the two of you kill artificial life on an almost daily basis during battles? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Our insurgency does it for obvious reasons, but Valentin and his army do it by accident all the time. 
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** So you made human replicas that exist to suffer from this war? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Veletin created the people to emulate a real society. They just so happen to be in the way and be a perfect target to get his attention during the war.
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** I- 
 
//A moment of silence.// 
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** I&#39;m... I&#39;m speechless. I have no words left except for the remaining pre-planned questions sitting in front of me. You are a pathetic entity... You and this, Valentin. 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** What&#39;s with all the drama, man? I just told you how it happened. 
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** Do you lack conviction? Do you know that just a week before the incident your &#34;men&#34; stormed churches and killed everyone? Including children... What about all those missile strikes afterward? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Who gives a shit, they&#39;re synthetic. 
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** I wish to end this little talk as soon as possible. You are a revolting entity. And that&#39;s all you&#39;ll ever be. Tell me where this other piece of this &#34;red ball&#34; is so I may leave. 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Tis&#39; in Döbling, Vienna. Small house to the right of the apartment complex, and the lab is accessible via the closet trapdoor. Go in take whatever I guess. I don&#39;t care anymore. 
 
I fought for a purpose in life and assembling that machine for myself would give my life purpose. Give my name glory in the world... A name no one would forget. Valentin wanted the same, too.  
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** And killing innocent people would help you do that? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Kind of, yes. But I don&#39;t feel remorse. I physically cannot anymore. It is because they are synthetic, but that&#39;s just a small part of it. The reason we do these things, why I did these things, is because I lack axioms like you do. You have irreversible axioms and morals you uphold because it is the logical thing to do.
 
But me, I have not one axiom. I&#39;m not a man of god, nor do I care for the outside world&#39;s laws. In war, the axioms you once upheld are nothing now. They don&#39;t matter in an illogical situation like that. It means nothing when your goal is so far out of reach, yet so much progress has been made...
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** I do not wish to hear a war speech right now. 
 
...So go ahead, take the machine. It&#39;s a long-gone goal to me now. Maybe one day I will take the opportunity to spread my name across the globe with it, but for now, I just wish to rest after everything. 
 
//Dr. Yusuf writes down the location of the other half of SCP-7799-BRBB.//   
 
**Dr. Yusuf:** Thank you, X. All of //this//, and its existence for it has been meaningless. One more anomaly that will be a thorn in the Foundation&#39;s side for a long time, and a waste of extensive resources. //(He looks to the two guards in the room).// Take it back to its cell. And give it its dinner.
 
**SCP-7799-3:** At least it is chicken sandwich day!

Two hours after this interrogation, multiple Foundation field agents were dispatched to Döbling, Vienna where SCP-7799-1 and SCP-7799-3&#39;s residents were closed off to the public. The other half of SCP-7799-BRBBB was retrieved and stored in a medium-sized closet accessible to any researchers partaking in the SCP-7799 research and containment project with given level three authorization.
 
The destructive capabilities of SCP-7799 are now substantially understood, and other Foundation action outside of its containment procedures has been deemed unnecessary, as SCP-7799 is believed to collapse on its own once SCP-7799-1&#39;s half of SCP-7799-BRBB has ceased function.
