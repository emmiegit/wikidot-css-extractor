**Item#:** SCP-1927-EX

**Object Class:** --Keter-- Explained

**Former Special Containment Procedures:** Manufacturers of cathode ray-tube electronics are to be infiltrated and taken over if necessary by Foundation assets. Broadcast television networks are to become Foundation-maintained assets in the same fashion. Corporate espionage procedures for this industry involve the following:

* Taking over as many broadcast stations as front companies can legally own in key regions
* Influencing legislation which allows for further consolidation of corporate assets
* Branding which allows public relations campaigns to be undetected as Foundation-based campaigns.

Once a consolidation on the American media market has taken place, further testing may result in more hands-off containment procedures.

**Description:** SCP-1927-EX is a phenomenon relating to the popularity and growth of television as a medium for broadcast news, entertainment and information. It has a far greater impact on public opinion compared to previous mass-media devices, such as the radio.

Since the invention of the television broadcast by PoI Philo T. Farnsworth in 1927, the public perception of global safety and security has declined in spite of statistical evidence. This same effect occurred at the advent of printed media, newspapers and radio but to a much lesser comparative effect.

Foundation media monitors initially classified SCP-1927-EX after analysis of news and public opinion showed anomalous correlations. It has since been classified as Explained.

    &lt;div id=&#34;secondText&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

“You know, we actually spend more on PR than anything else combined. It’s not that surprising once you think about it. Yes, we are a secret organization, but that simply means we must work harder on keeping the public both safe and ignorant. Do you know how many gas explosions, overnight murders, and strange disappearances actually occur? It’s not many, or at least not as many as there are recorded. In the course of my experience with SCP-1927-EX, I believe I was the first to discover just how wide the discrepancy was.”&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
“I forget who first wrote up SCP-1927-EX. We just called it SCP-1927 back then, you know I’d be lying if I said I knew what SCP-1927 is today. Anyways, the file you’re reading is unedited from its original documentation besides all the “-EX”s and other markers of an explained file. It was even then theoretical, not even seen as a meme or cognitohazard. Simply a global trend. But I remember O5-10 specifically saying “I’ll be damned if the TVs cast an imaginary shadow over the Earth and make us cower into the Dark Ages.” Drama queen. I said I didn’t remember who wrote the first entry for SCP-1927-EX, but I sure as hell know who sponsored it.”&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;div id=&#34;thirdCollapsible&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#&#34; onClick=&#34;showHide(&#39;thirdText&#39;);&#34;&gt;&gt;Continue Access?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id=&#34;thirdText&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“Word of mouth spread quickly, and soon it was bigger than Bigfoot. You couldn&#39;t help but hear the chattering masses. “Did you hear television is an SCP now?”, “How the hell should I spend Saturday night now?”, “How come we just don&#39;t make them forget, anyways?” The first two questions are irrelevant, but the third inspired some discussion. We didn’t have such an amnestic stockpile as we need today. O5-10 proposed we screw normalcy and burn the TVs to a crisp. O5-7 suggested a countermeme of general optimism. O5-3 would be the one to propose the would-be containment procedures. The vote was a draw, 4-4-4. I abstained from voting. I had never owned a television.”&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;div id=&#34;fourthCollapsible&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#&#34; onClick=&#34;showHide(&#39;fourthText&#39;);&#34;&gt;&gt;Keep Watching?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id=&#34;fourthText&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
“Normality and Normalcy. Television really sparked the debate. How much influence was too much, how much undermined our mission? The constant noise of the cafeterias turned into a silent paranoia, while the arguing moved to higher levels. It was a crisis atmosphere. I remember standing just across from two O5s screaming at each other, and the two voices combined into this incomprehensible static. In the midst of the heated argument, though one cannot call it an argument when both sides drown out each other with their own voices, I stood up, walked out, and went into the recreation room of Site-01.”&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
“Our break-room remains hardly what one would expect for R&amp;R. The enormous room’s walls are covered with bookshelves, filled by thousands upon thousands of centuries-old books, pamphlets, and tomes of Foundation history. Yet, despite the mostly antiquated interior, there was, at the time, a portable Westinghouse set on a small table. I stared at the device for a moment, wondering what it would do to me. Would I notice it? Would the effect work on me? I activated the TV, turned the dials, and sat down as the voice of an old man, only truly meant for radio, filled the airwaves.”&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
“It was us.” &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;fifthCollapsible&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#&#34; onClick=&#34;showHide(&#39;fifthText&#39;);&#34;&gt;&gt;Still watching?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id=&#34;fifthText&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“The Florencio Hospital explosion, the Minnesota Wood-Chipper Killer, the rotface outbreak in Arlosville, all of them were our doing, our reports, our lies. Switching from channel to channel, more of our doing, the same kinds of incidents, deaths, and disappearances as always. Everyone was so somber, and horrified, and scared. I couldn’t look away. Like kids playing pretend car crash, watching our cars obliterating each other, over and over and over again. There was no meme, no anomaly. Just violence and terror to cover up real fear. The TV simply let me watch it unfold.”&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
“I went back into the Council room and everyone fell silent. I took a note card, wrote “No action necessary”, and put it on the table for all to see. They all looked at me, then at O5-3. O5-7 looked disappointed, while O5-10 was sweating bullets, but I was the most paranoid person in the room. O5-3 simply smiled and started writing in their notebook.” &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;sixthCollapsible&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#&#34; onClick=&#34;showHide(&#39;sixthText&#39;);&#34;&gt;&gt;Watch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id=&#34;sixthText&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“The next few decades have been calmer. SCP-1927 was explained, the media companies were infiltrated and, in most cases, bought out by us, and the technology required to make television was and still is highly controlled by the Foundation. In the end, I can’t imagine there’s one channel that isn’t controlled by us. But I think I learned why SCP-1927-EX was initially written. We weren’t trying to save others. We were scaring the public into safety. Now we’re scaring ourselves. Even if we&#39;re really safer, sometimes the perception of danger is worse than a gun pointed at your head.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;seventhCollapsible&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#&#34; onClick=&#34;showHide(&#39;seventhText&#39;);&#34;&gt;&gt;CERTIFY CLEARANCE CHECK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;div id=&#34;seventhText&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;border-style: solid; background-color: #e6e6e6; font-size:20; border-width: medium; border-color: red; padding: 10px;&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;CLEARANCE CHALLENGED&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Please wait at your terminal. A member of security will be along shortly to ensure you&#39;re still watching.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Don&#39;t change the channel.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; We&#39;ll be right back.
