It was a quiet, peaceful morning. One of the few times the foundation was able to metaphorically relax. However, everyone knew it wouldn’t last. The only question was, when would the grace period be shattered. Joshua Richards woke with a start. He was a mild mannered security guard who worked at site-65, and may or may not have a nicotine addiction. But then, WHAM! He remembered everything. The mission, his comrades, everything. Slowly he came to the realization that he did not work for the foundation. He was not a security guard, and he did not care for any of his fellow guards. Joshua Richards was a chaos insurgent. In the barracks all around the site two other agents were realizing the same thing. Frank Zhang and Thomas Zachary met Richards at the entrance to the janitorial closet of the site.

Richards Lit a cigarette and looked around nervously. “Ok so what the fuck just happened?” He abruptly said. Because all in the span of ten seconds, I just realized I was a chaos insurgent, that I need to go here, and that I’m supposed to start an outbreak of some kind, and I have no idea what the fuck any of this shit means” 

Frank Zhang looked at him funny. The corners of his mouth twitched up, bristling the hairs of his goatee. “It’s obvious! I must have been the leader here because I received the most information. There’s a wooden box that was placed inside this room by another insurgent. It contains some sort of disease. The instructions were: Give it to someone and let them spread chaos.”

 “I don’t think this is a good idea” remarked Zachary. “I think we are with the foundation now, we shouldn’t follow orders we don’t even remember receiving!”

 “You idiot, don’t you realize?” Zhang retorted. “we are sleeper agents for the insurgency! They erased our memories so we would be accepted here. I don’t know how they did it but those bastards set us up perfectly to bring this place to its knees.”

 Richards took a drag on his cancer stick and responded with “both of you calm down.” “We have to slow down and analyze our options here.” 

“screw analyzing our options!” Zachary whisper yelled. “I’m out of here! If you guys want to continue your suicide mission go right ahead.” 

“You really were the wrong choice for this op” muttered Zhang. “You know I can’t let you leave Tom.”

 “What?!” Zachary questioned, panic flickering in his hazel eyes

 “If I do, you will tell the foundation.”

Zachary froze. “Well then what do we do?”

“Tom, there is only one option.” Zhang bluntly stated. “And just so you know, this is not personal.” 

“WAIT!!” Tom screeched. 

But it was far too late. Zhang had made up his mind. Two stark gunshots rang out, followed by a dull thud. Thomas Zachary’s eyes glazed over as he wallowed in his own blood. Crimson quickly stained the clean white tiling of the floor.

 “HOLY CRAP ZHANG” Richards screamed, his cigarette falling from his mouth.

 “No time now Josh”, said Zhang.

 He rummaged through the pockets of his security uniform, pulling out a keycard. With practiced precision he opened the closet door. Quickly they shuffled inside and closed the door. Zhang walked to the shelves littering the left wall of the room. He ripped open the lid of a mahogany box. Inside was a small vial containing murky liquid. Zhang snatched it and turned to Richards. The vial glinted in the dim lighting. 

“This is how the foundation falls”.

------

“Three pair, you lose again Adam.” Said the leader of MTF Epsilon-11, Michael Blake.

 “Yeah Yeah whatever boss.” Adam Fletcher, Blake’s second in command sighed. You just got lucky.”

Fletcher was an former security guard at site-19 who had survived a both a breach from SCP-049 and an expedition into SCP-610. Because of nominal performance on both fronts, he was promoted to an MTF operative.

 Blake smirked and retorted with “You wish.”  

“Are you imbeciles playing poker again?” Said Carlos Ruiz as he strode into the room with a signature smug smile.

 “Why? You want in?” Said Sergei Petrov, the quietest member of the team.

Sergei had been incarcerated in a Russian prison for disclosing classified information to the US. He was too useful to be a class-D, so as punishment he was permanently assigned to this MTF unit until his death. Despite the insane amount of missions he had been on, he hadn’t bit the dust just yet.

 “Sure, I’ll take your money any day of the week.” Replied Ruiz. “I mean, Blake still owes me 20$”

Ruiz was a former SWAT operative who had been recruited by the foundation because of his excellent marksmanship. He was the squads designated marksman and also had a tendency to be a bit of a dick.

 Jacob Li, the newest member of the team, looked to his comrades from his position on the Mat. “You know you should be training not playing poker.” He said with a condescending undertone. “Come on, I need a sparring partner!” 

Li was a Researcher who had shown promise in combat evaluations, and physical power. He was recommended a position as an MTF operative because of his high placements in these skill areas. as He was confident, but also scared of what was to come.

Fletcher dealt a new round of cards on the table “I don’t give a shit what you want us to do” he said without even glancing at Li.

 “Hey! Blake interjected, “go easy on the new guy. We were all him once.” He said whilst checking his hand. 

Fletcher shot a death glare at Li. “Sure boss” he said, whilst shooting a death glare at Li. 

Ten seconds passed. No one said a word. Another card was flipped. 

“Fold” said Petrov, breaking the uneasy silence. He placed his cards down on the table and lumbered over to Li. “I’ll spar you.” he nonchalantly stated.

 Li looked up at The Russian behemoth in front of him. Petrov was 6’8” and nearly 350 pounds of muscle. Li in comparison was 5’10” and 190 pounds. The matchup was nowhere near fair.

  Blake stood from the table, putting himself between Li and Petrov. “That’s enough” He interrupted. 

He was nowhere near as tall as Petrov, only standing at 6’2”, but he commanded respect. Blake was as close to a veteran you can get in the foundation. An Ex-Marine, he was recruited by the foundation after a dishonorable discharge because of insubordination.  He had seen it all, and killed most of it. You don’t make it to MTF Sergeant without seeing some serious shit. Petrov looked over at Blake, Then Li, and sat back down.

 “Jesus do I always have to be the babysitter for you Bastards?” Ruiz asked. “Li, get over here and play some poker with us.”

 Li’s face contorted into a Grimace that looked unnatural on his perfectly groomed face. 

“Well err.. I don’t know how to play.” Li bluntly said.  

Fletcher’s Grin was so wide he nearly split the scar that stretched across his face back open. “Oh god kid you are so screwed” He joked.

 Blake Sighed in disbelief.  “Okay Li, do you want to know how to play?” 

------

“Oh god… you killed him….” Richards muttered in disbelief. 

“Oh shut up.” Zhang replied. “We don’t have much time. The guards will be on our asses any second.” 

Richards face fell as he resigned to his fate as an insurgent. “Well it looks like I have no choice here” He replied. “How do we start the outbreak?” 

Zhang smiled a sinister grin. “We just need one live subject.” He said. “wanna guess who that is?” 

Suddenly the door was nearly knocked off its hinges. The security personnel had reached them, and has seen Zachary’s body on the cold tiles. FWOOM! The door was hit again. The metal door was beginning to bend. Soon it would break altogether.

 “Zhang you can’t possibly mean me can you?” Richards questioned.

 Zhang wasted no time with his response “I’m sorry, but there’s no one else.” He said curtly. “The mission has to be completed.”  

Zhang held up his pistol and bludgeoned Richards. Richards hit the floor, woozy and disoriented. He attempted to struggle to his feet. But before he even got to his knees a rough hand flipped him over and forced open his jaw. FWOOM! The door creaked even more. It would soon be open, and when it broke a storm of gunfire would fill them both with bullets. Lukewarm liquid filled his mouth. He tried to spit it out but his mouth was clamped shut and his nose was pinched. Now he either swallowed to breathe or died of asphyxiation. Neither option was pleasant. He raised his arms in a futile attempt to claw Zhangs arms off of him. FWOOM! The door was barely holding. Maybe if he could wait until the foundation’s guards burst in.

 “SWALLOW ALREADY YOU FUCKING IDIOT!” Zhang screamed. 

FWOOM! Richards couldn’t hold his breath any longer. He had to swallow. He waited for the final push… but he couldn’t do it. The burning in his chest was too fierce. He swallowed. He knew he was doomed from that moment forth. 

BWANG!!!!! 

The door burst off its hinges. The barrels of six p90 submachine guns pointed directly at Zhang. He only had time to say one word.

 “Fuck” 

his face contorted into a suprised grimace as hail of bullets riddled his body. his blood painted the walls and bits of his brain and bones splattered across the floor. He was dead before he hit the ground. The leader of the security guards stepped into the room, nearly slipping because the room was slick with blood. Richards didn’t dare to move. He was covered in Zhangs blood and brains, if he didn’t move maybe he would be mistaken as dead.

 “Ramirez! What do you see?” Asked a gangly guard peeking through the door, p90 still smoking. 

The Leader surveyed the room, picking at the bits of brain left on the walls. “Looks like there was a struggle.” said the guard that was named Ramirez. 

The gangly guard chuckled. “No shit Sherlock” he chortled.

 “I think it’s clear here.” Said Ramirez. “We should get a-“ 

Suddenly Richards sprang from the floor. He grabbed Ramirez and sunk his teeth into his neck. Ramirez released a bloodcurdling scream and sprayed his p90 in front of him. His bullets tore through his fellow guards. 2 of his comrades were killed by the friendly fire. Another was shot several times in the stomach, prompting him to start convulsing on the floor. The other guard was shot in the calf and immediately began to apply pressure to his wound. The only guard untouched was the gangly guard. seconds later Ramirez was on the ground, eyes glassy, being feasted on by a man, no… a monster, who was named Joshua Richards in a past life. The gangly guard ran for his life. His wounded companion screamed curses at “Agent Gregg” but Gregg didn’t care. He was saving his own skin. He ran towards the control room screaming:

“SCP-008 HAS BREACHED CONTAINMENT!!!”

Researchers panicked at the thought. This could potentially be a world ending scenario. Soon the entire facility was in a panic. Researchers with no way to defend themselves were quickly devoured. Class-Ds were little more than canned food, once their cell doors broke they were dead meat. Security Guards attempted to hold back the masses of SCP-008-1, but it was futile. The hordes were much too big to be killed by on-site security. All that the security did was add to the horde. Remaining personnel hid or fled, there were no other options. But before it all went to shit, one doctor gave the site a chance. 

------

“And thats how you play poker” Blake concluded with a grin on his scarred face. 

Li looked at the table, now covered in empty beer bottles. “I still don’t understand 70% of this” He stated. “and I still don’t like any of you.”

Fletcher lit a Cigar. “eh, live long enough and you will learn to love us.” he said between drags of his cigar. “And probably poker too.” 

There was silence as he took a few puffs. Out of nowhere the intercom spoke up.

 “Attention all personnel. There has been a containment breach at site-65. According to Dr. Holmes SCP-008 has breached containment and the on-site security have taken too many casualties to deal with the breach. They have declared a code blue breach. MTF Epsilon-11, designated Nine tailed Fox, report to the control room as soon as possible”

 “Oh well” said Ruiz “Guess poker will have to wait.”

 They each grabbed a tactical vest filled to the brim with magazines, and a advanced combat helmet each fitted with an M40 gas mask and thermal imaging goggles. They each then pulled on thick leather gloves and combat boots. Petrov grabbed a 12 inch combat knife that looked more like a sword than knife, as well as the standard issue M4. Blake grabbed his M4 with a skeleton key attached. Ruiz grabbed his standard issue Barrett 50. Cal sniper rifle. The rest grabbed their M4s and strapped up with ammo. Fletcher snatched some fragmentation grenades and they were off.  They made it to the control room and were instructed to head to the helipad 

Fletcher tightened the straps on his helmet and shot a glance at Li. “get ready for mission numero uno kid.” He joked. 

Li winced, clearly not ready for the mission.

Blake looked over at Li and said “kid, I’m not gonna let you get hurt. I promise.”

Li nodded gratefully and they piled into the Helicopter. they were off. The only question left now was who was going to make it out alive.

------

Dr. Holmes was frantically alerting the foundation. There was no way they don’t respond to a code blue breach. They had to send an MTF. Every second they delayed, the door to the control room was wedged open slightly more by the seemingly endless horde of SCP-008-1 instances. 

“Come on come on you greedy bastards! Send an MTF!” Holmes screamed. 

Of all the things Holmes had seen in his time at the foundation, zombies were some of the least scary. There was no way he was going to end up as a living corpse. Almost all of the site-65 personnel were now SCP-008-1 instances. All that was left was a small group in the control room. Agent Gregg (the gangly security guard), Holmes, Dr. Lucy Weber and two junior researchers, Ted and Sarah. The small group had no chance unless a miracle took place. So when MTF Epsilon-11 designated Nine tailed fox entered the facility, they cheered.

------

Blake held up his hand. The small group of operatives stopped. Blake screwed on his suppressor and nodded. He and Fletcher disappeared into the office on the right. Petrov tapped Ruiz on the shoulder and mentioned that Li should stay In the hallway in case any hostiles should ambush from there. He then entered the office on the left with Ruiz. Blake led Fletcher into the room, peeking around the corner. He quickly pulled back. He put up 5 fingers and Fletcher nodded. Both quickly stood and fired. Their accuracy was on point and barely any shots missed. Blake put a hole through two of the hostiles heads before they had a chance to attack and Fletcher riddled a third with a full burst. Blake shifted his focus onto the hostile closest to him. He fired off three rounds. The first split apart the hostiles collarbone, hurting it and stalling its attack. the second hit the hostiles jugular vein in its neck, spewing blood and causing the hostile to fall backwards for an easy kill shot to the head. Fletcher took care of his last hostile with ease also. Pulling out his hunting knife, he put the hostile in a headlock and quickly drove his knife through its skull. Blake then tapped Fletcher on the shoulder and they exited whilst calling out “Clear” so their comrades knew what rooms were already taken care of. 

Blake paused at the entrance of the room. “Good shooting Adam” he said with pride in his voice.


Fletcher chuckled. “I learned from the best.” he replied.

Petrov and Ruiz had a much easier time with only two hostiles. Ruiz took a backseat as his sniper was too loud. He could only watch as Petrov smashed one hostile so hard into the wall that chunks of its head went flying. Petrov quickly headshot the other hostile with deadly accuracy. They repeated the same song and dance as Blake and Fletcher tap on the shoulder, exit, “Clear.” As they were in their respective rooms, Li noticed a strange groaning. he turned and facing him was a single zombie. He whipped his gun to his shoulder and popped off a round. It grazed the zombie, taking a chunk of his ear with it. The hostile continued on, unfazed. Li, being inexperienced in the field was beginning to panic. He shot off three more rounds, all hitting center mass, but no headshots. Blood soaked through the orange class-D jumpsuit the zombie was wearing. Li raised his gun slightly higher, firing off a full burst of 7 rounds. Finally the hostile went down with a sickening crunch. Li was concerned, as it had taken him 11 rounds to kill one hostile. But he kept it together. The rest of the team converged in the hallway. 

Blake immediately let go of a breath he didn’t even know he was holding. Everyone was still alive. And then he saw the ravaged body. “Jesus Li, how many bullets did it take you to kill one of these things?”

Li sheepishly looked over at his comrades. “Eleven.” He solemnly stated.


“Godamnit Li” Blake said, exasperated. “ I’m going to need you to calm down. I know you are new, but that’s no excuse to be wasting half a clip on one of these things.”

“I’m sorry boss, but we need to get on with this.” Fletcher said, whilst tugging at Blakes sleeve to get him to move.


They repeated this process several more times with varying levels of success and hostiles neutralized. After repeating this long and trying process for the seventh time, Fletcher broke the silence.

 “I get this is slow and methodical boss, but there’s no way we get all of them this way.” 

Blake flipped up his thermal goggles. “So then what do you propose we do, smartass?” He Inquired.

  Fletcher took out his grenades from his tac-vest. “I say we draw em out into some kind of trap and get ‘em all at once.” He said. “What do you think?”

 Blake squinted, the gears inside his head turning. “That… is actually kind of a good idea.”  He said in shock. He looked towards the small squad of killing machines and wasted no time in speaking. “Ruiz and I will run towards the cafeteria and lead them here, where Petrov and Li will have set up a trap using fletchers grenades. Fletcher will shoot the grenades once myself and Ruiz are in the clear. Keep in contact Gentlemen.”

  Blake gestured towards Ruiz and they began to stalk down the hall. Blake gave Ruiz a thumbs up and unscrewed his suppressor. He snuck through the hall with Ruiz on his tail until they reached the Cafe. They turned the corner and saw one of the most horrible sights a human being could bear to see. The room was covered in blood. Severed limbs were strewn everywhere. And unlike in the rest of the building where bodies were sparse for the most part, this room was filled with bodies. Class-D, Doctors, Researchers, Security. SCP-008 did not discriminate by class, race or gender. It consumed all.

 “holy Mary mother of god” Ruiz uttered in shock and horror. 

Blake raised his gun and fired the skeleton key. A shotgun blast ripped through the hostiles closest to him. Killing at least 2 and wounding several others. Ruiz raised his sniper rifle and blew the head off of a zombie as it began to trudge towards him. It’s body slumped to the ground. The two were soon split apart by the sheer number of hostiles. Ruiz was forced to back up against a wall, and Blake was nearly forced out of the room. After 7 minutes of fighting both were barely holding their own.

 Blake screamed over to Ruiz “WE HAVE THEIR ATTENTION, LETS GO!”

But it was too late. Ruiz’s sniper rifle was out of ammo and his pistol would be dry soon as well. Blake ignored the hostiles heading towards him and instead helped shoot the ones going towards Ruiz. Blood splashed all over the cafeteria walls as the skirmish raged on. Blake Kicked a zombie in its rotting rib cage, causing it to topple a couple other living dead like pins at a bowling alley. He risked a glance at His comrade and shouted,

 “Let’s go Ruiz!”

 Ruiz looked at Blake and smiled.“what? Think I can’t handle a couple puny zombies? He laughed. “Just go Blake.”

Blake’s M4 was starting to run dry. He was cycling through clips like it was nothing. “This is not the time for jokes Ruiz, you know I’m not leaving you!” He screamed. 

But both men knew Ruiz was already dead. His pistol was out of ammo. The dead were converging on him. Ruiz turned to face Blake. The zombies reached him. They ripped and tore and bit at Ruiz all over. Ruiz smiled, blood staining his teeth.  And with this manic grin He uttered his final words. 

“You still owe me 20 bucks…..”

 and with that, he was dragged down into the mass of teeth and limbs. Blake had seen a lot of death. Friends turned into bloody paste beside him. Heads exploded, bullets through heads and hearts. But Ruiz had been with him longer than most. He almost couldn’t remember a time when he didn’t have Ruiz on his team. He stood, shocked at what had just happened. Luckily for him, most of the instances of SCP-008-1 were concerned with eating Ruiz, thus making Blake have to wait until they were done to continue the plan. More Hostiles filed down the Hall. The horde seemed endless. The hostiles eating Ruiz got up they all lumbered towards Blake. Blake quickly snapped out of his shock and began leading the hostiles down hallway after hallway, careful not to make any wrong turns. Until finally he turned the final corner. Streaked with blood and slick with sweat he sprinted towards the end of the hallway for cover, all whilst screaming:

 “BLOW THE TRAP!” 

------

Petrov took the huge sack of grenades, bouncing with each lumbering step.

Li watched in horror. “We are all gonna die. There’s no way that buffoon sets up this trap right, and if he does it’s going to backfire and.. and….”

Fletcher grabbed him by the shoulders. “Calm down kid, yer gonna be fine.” He sighed “listen up because I’m not going to repeat this. I was you once. Never had shot a gun, never had killed a thing in my life. But I learned. Blake is a good sarge, he is not gonna let you get killed.”

Li looked at Fletcher, doubt marring his face. “That’s bull! Blake is just a man, he can’t change anything that happens!”

Fletcher looked disappointed. “You will understand later, probably after my luck has run out. Just think of it this way: everyone has a time. Yours is not right now, otherwise you would be dead. There’s no way to escape your death, so why care so much? Everyone has a time. All you can do is always be ready for yours.

Suddenly, Blake appeared from behind the corner screaming. He sprinted towards them And leaped over a upturned table, Fletcher aimed down his sights  and then….. his gun jammed. Fletcher slammed his gun down against the table they were using as cover, he shook it and slapped it hoping it would unjam. But it would not work. The zombies shuffled closer and closer to the operatives. Li realized there was only one way out. He wouldn’t be able to hit the shot. 

He turned towards Fletcher, and said “ I think I understand now.”

He sprinted towards the bag. Zombies ripped at his suit and tore his gun from him as he ran. He reached the bag and began to unzip it. Zombies bit into his legs as he pulled the pin on the grenade closest to him. 1……2…..3…..KRAKOOOM! The grenades all went off together. Shrapnel flew everywhere. Every square inch of the hallway and most of the room was peppered with shrapnel. Blood coated the entirety of the hallway. So many bits of zombie splattered down on the floor that it sounded like it was raining. The corpses began to flop over one by one. Thump, Thump, Thump. Until only 2 stood. They slogged forward, ignoring the obvious fate that their actions held. Blake and Fletcher popped up and neutralized each of them in seconds. Damage was then assessed. The SCP-008-1 instances were all dead. All that was required was a clean up sweep and extraction. Petrov had taken a piece of shrapnel to the shoulder and calf. Which would render him useless as of now. And Li, wait… where was Li? The room went quiet. A small gurgling sound was heard by all of the operatives. It was coming from behind one of the tables set up for cover. Petrov peeked around the edge, seeing the young operative.

 Petrov then spoke the most words that his teammates had ever hear him say In one sitting. “why does it always have to be the kids?”

 Li was on the floor with a large piece of shrapnel jutting from his throat. His entire body was covered in burns and shrapnel. His once perfect face covered in blood. His eyes were glossy and his fingers twitched on the trigger of his gun. Blood burbled up from the enormous gash in his neck. It sunk into the cracks of the tile and ran down the walls behind him. He had made the ultimate sacrifice. no questions about it. Blake wanted to call this operation a success, but with so many deaths how could that be justified? Hell, he thought. He had failed. The kid was dead because of him. If only he had been there to make the sacrifice instead. Maybe he wasn’t fit for this job. Maybe he cared too much. 

“Mike, it was his choice.” Said Fletcher. “You can’t blame yourself for this”

Blake stood. Memorizing everything about both Li and Ruiz in his head and adding them to the mental database of friends he had lost. “You know I will blame myself Adam.” He replied. “I promised to keep him alive.” 

Petrov Winced In pain as he opened his mouth to speak carefully thought out words. “He was a good kid. I wish I could tell him that.”

They sullenly stood around Li before Fletcher grabbed a bodybag and zipped it up around the battered body.  
Petrov slowly turned his head to the hallway which looked like it was painted completely red. A single zombie shuffled through the hallway. Petrov limped two steps toward it and fired. A direct headshot spurted blood from the back of the walking corpses skull. But it just kept coming. The zombie was dressed in the garb of a security officer and seemed to be bigger than the other zombies. It locked eyes with Petrov and everyone froze. Why wasn’t it dead? The zombie slowly and clumsily reached into a pocket and retrieved a handgun. All three operatives realized a second too late what was about to happen. In a flash the zombie took aim, and fired. Petrov turned to get away and was hit in the shoulder. As he limped to cover, another hit him below his rib cage. The zombie continued to fire whilst walking forward. Blake popped out of cover and emptied his entire clip into the monstrosity, but it did little damage. 

Blake turned to Fletcher as he reloaded, saying: “this thing isn’t gonna die from bullets! We gotta find another way!” 

“I’ve got nothing man!” Fletcher said as he looked up from his gun. “How on gods green earth did this son of a bitch get so resilient?”

Petrov, barely breathing, stood. “I know how to kill it.” He groaned. “Stop shooting it”

Petrov grasped the handle of his enormous hunting knife and looked at the abomination in front of him.

 For the first time In the entirety of his working with Petrov, Blake saw him smile.

“We fight like men.” Petrov stated.

Whatever human instincts left in this monster took over, if only for a second, and dropped the gun.

Petrov and the monster both screamed War cries as they charged towards each other.

The zombie went for a blind grab, which Petrov punished with a shallow slice to the monsters chest. Petrov took advantage of the momentum and drove his enormous knife deep into the creatures neck. It squealed in terror and rage and knocked him off of it with a savage kick. Petrov quickly got up. He was big, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t smart. He knew his adrenaline would wear off soon. If he didn’t finish this thing soon he would be doomed. The zombie attempted to regain its momentum by going for a berserker charge. Petrov darted out of the way like a man half his size and kneed  the monster In the face, breaking its rotten nose. The amalgamation swiped at Petrov, attempting to slash his throat open, but before it could reach him, Blake jumped onto its back. Blake pulled out his own knife and plunged it deep into the abomination’s eye. It shook In terror as it realized it may not win this fight. Blake barely held on, pulling out his M4 as Petrov charged back into the fight. Fletcher scrambled over to the monsters leg whilst it was distracted and slit the back of its knee before plunging his knife into its kneecap. Blake hopped off the monster and blasted his skeleton key into its chest over and over. Rotten flesh rained onto the ground as the monster acquired an enormous hole in its abnormally large chest.

“JUST DIE ALREADY!!!” Blake roared as he kept putting round after round into the creature.

The monstrosity dropped to its knees, it’s energy spent. It looked up to the huge form of Sergei Petrov who reared back and gave it a skull shattering punch. 

Petrov pulled his hand out of the monster and collapsed, near death.

Blake instantly took action. He was not going to lose another friend today. “Overwatch this is Epsilon-11 (e)-1 Michael Blake, we need immediate medevac. We have a wounded man.” he looked to Petrov. “Stay with me you big Russian oaf.” He paused, looking into Petrov’s eyes. “I swear to god if you die I am going to travel to hell to carry your dumb ass all the way back up to earth!”

The helicopter arrived 15 minutes later.  Waiting on the helipad for them was Fletcher and Blake with the still breathing Petrov. The helicopter quickly took him and flew off. Fletcher and Blake approached the control room, which seemed to be the only room that wasn’t littered with blood and bodies. After breaking through the door, they found a small group of human survivors. One Security guard, one doctor, one researcher and two junior researchers. Maybe, Blake thought to himself, maybe this operation was successful. They had saved some people, they re-secured the site, that had to count for something. But none of what he felt mattered now. All Michael Blake wanted now was a Vacation.

Epilogue:

Sergei Petrov woke up slowly. Every part of his body felt sore and every time he breathed it felt like a hot iron was being stabbed into his chest. But pain… pain was good. Pain meant he was still living. He attempted to stand, and woke Blake, who was sleeping in a chair next to his bedside. Blake’s eyes widened and he gently pushed Petrov back into his chair.

Blake sat back down and relaxed. “take a rest Petrov, you earned it.”

“Where is Fletcher?” Petrov croaked, his voice rasping as he spoke.

Blake picked at his fingernails as he replied. “Fletcher is getting breakfast. Petrov, the foundation gave us all commendations and a month off for our work.”

“Not me.” Said Petrov, remembering his punishment.

“Your case is different, they revoked your sentence to this team because of your actions under duress. You know what that means right Petrov? you can leave! You can retire!”

Petrov grinned, an action that made him immediately regret doing so because of the pain. “I’m staying Mike.”

Mike stood. “What?”

Petrov chuckled weakly. “if I leave who else will look after you and Fletcher?”

Blake walked over to Petrov and gave him a bear hug. “Glad you are staying.”

Petrov happily Sighed. “Trust me Blake, you are not going to lose another friend ever again.”
