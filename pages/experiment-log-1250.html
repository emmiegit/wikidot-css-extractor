+ Experiment Log 1250-A: //Audio Recordings.//

**Note:** Please be sure to include your name, the date, and duration of the recording on all records.

&gt; **Name:** Dr. T████
&gt; **Date:** ██/██/199█
&gt; **Duration:** 00:02:47
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. T████ is heard reciting an adaptation of the poem &#34;Der Erlkonig&#34; by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control tape:** Dr. T████ reads the poem in its entirety.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-1 tape:** The poem is read in its native German by an unidentified voice.

&gt; **Name:** Dr. Edwards
&gt; **Date:** 03/██/2000
&gt; **Duration:** 00:26:19
&gt; 
&gt; A television in the background plays a syndicated episode of the popular children&#39;s show [REDACTED].
&gt; 
&gt; **Control tape:** The episode follows a character named Billy as he helps a close friend plan an important birthday party.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-1 tape:** This episode follows the same Billy attempting to try out for the school basketball team. Curiously there are no commercial breaks, and a portion of the same episode plays again before the tape is stopped.

&gt; **Name:** Dr. T████
&gt; **Date:** 09/██/200█
&gt; **Duration:** 00:00:14
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. T████ introduces himself by saying; &#39;Hello, I&#39;m ██████ T████. It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you&#39;.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control tape:** Dr. T████ says the above greeting.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-1 tape (1):** A female voice says the greeting. The first name is replaced with Emily instead of ██████.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-1 tape (2):** A series of loud beeps and clicks play for the duration of the recording. There is no recognizable pattern.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-1 tape (3):** Dr. T████ is heard attempting to say the greeting. He sounds very weak, and takes several labored breaths after every few words. He does not finish the greeting before the recording ends.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-1 tape (4):** Two separate voices say the greeting. They are very stoic, and they speak in perfect unison. Neither voice can be identified as that of Dr. T████.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-1 tape (5):** The tape sounds as though it is immersed in water. A light tapping can be heard somewhere nearby.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-1 tape (6):** A crowd of people can be heard murmuring in the room. All of the voices appear to be uttering the greeting, though it is impossible to tell if Dr. T████ is among them.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-1 tape (7):** Dr. T████ is heard counting down from 14, reaching 0 just as the recording ends.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-1 tape (8):** The tape is entirely silent for the 14 second duration.

&gt; **Name:** Dr. ███████, with Dr. T████ monitoring.
&gt; **Date:** ██/11/200█
&gt; **Duration:** 00:08:04
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. ███████ interviews Mr. █████. Several times during the interview, Dr. ███████ will randomly hold up a card with a simple drawing on it, and ask Mr. █████ to describe what he sees. A total of 7 cards were held up during the course of the interview. It&#39;s important to note that aside from the card results, both interviews were the same.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control tape:** Mr. █████&#39;s responses to the image cards: cat, airplane, flower, barn, teddy bear, horse, apple.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-1 tape:** Mr. █████&#39;s responses to the image cards: pencil, window, swan, tree, airplane, bus, moon. All responses given were for cards that did exist in the deck.
 
&gt; **Name:** Dr. Edwards, with Dr. ████ performing.
&gt; **Date:** █6/██/2006
&gt; **Duration:** 00:11:02
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. ████ was asked to play Moonlight Sonata on an old grand piano. He has very little experience playing the instrument.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control tape:** Dr. ████ hits several bum notes, and re-attempts several sections of the song to correct mistakes. He politely asks to stop playing after attempting for over 10 minutes, and the recording is ceased by Dr. Edwards.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-1 tape (1):** Dr. ████ handles the instrument flawlessly, playing with considerable grace, and receives a roaring applause from the other researchers present. In the place of Moonlight Sonata, the song played by Dr. ████ is unknown.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-1 tape (2):** A single note is played in 2 second intervals until 00:09:09. No other sounds can be heard for the remainder of the recording.

&gt; **Name:** Dr. Carter
&gt; **Date:** ██/██/200█
&gt; **Duration:** 00:08:06
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Carter calmly asks questions regarding the nature of SCP-1250, SCP-1250-1, &amp; SCP-1250-2.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control tape:** Dr. Carter asks the aforementioned questions.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-1 tape (1):** Dr. Carter can be heard talking, though he is very muffled, almost as if he were speaking from the other side of a wall. The nature of his speech is entirely indecipherable.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-1 tape (2):** A loud, atonal screeching emanates from the tape for the entire duration of the recording.

&gt; **Name:** Dr. T████
&gt; **Date:** ██/██/2009
&gt; **Duration:** 00:45:03
&gt; 
&gt; Three tapes were left to record an empty room for 45 minutes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control tape:** Dr. T████ is heard exiting the room as the recording begins. Apart from a nearby door being closed at 00:27:01, the recording is entirely silent until Dr. T████&#39;s return at 00:44:51 to end the recording.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-1 tape (1):** Dr. T████ is heard exiting the room as the recording begins. Infrequently, a light shuffling can be heard to the direct left. At 00:05:02 heavy, deliberate footsteps are slowly heard approaching from the left and continuing on past the empty room to the right. They can no longer be heard at 00:24:44, and the shuffling ceases at this point. Dr. T████ reenters the room at 00:45:16 to end the recording.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-1 tape (2):** Dr. T████ is heard exiting the room as the recording begins. At 00:13:08 a loud crash is heard coming from the right. Another loud crash occurs at 00:16:02, and an even louder one at 00:19:17. Something begins pounding on the wall in the hall outside the empty room at 00:26:20 and continues to do so with a consistent intensity. The door to the empty room is heard being torn from the frame at 00:44:10 as something proceeds to thrash it around the room. The tape cuts off at 00:45:03.

+ Experiment Log 1250-B: //Video Recordings//

**Note:** Please be sure to include your name, the date, and duration of the recording on all records. Due to the omission of audio by SCP-1250-2 video samples, all descriptions provided should cover only what is seen during the control tapes, not what is heard.


&gt; **Name:** Dr. ██████ And Dr. ████
&gt; **Date:** ██/██/199█
&gt; **Duration:** 00:00:43
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. ████ Pitches a baseball to Dr. ██████ from a distance of 15 meters.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control tape:** Dr. ██████&#39;s bat is seen making contact with the ball, sending the ball flying far past the view of the camera. Dr. ████ claps in response to the home run.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-2 tape:** Dr. ████ is seen stifling a cough, delaying the pitch by 4 seconds. Dr. ██████&#39;s bat is seen making contact with the ball, resulting in a foul.

&gt; **Name:** Dr. T████
&gt; **Date:** ██/██/1997
&gt; **Duration:** 02:16:25
&gt;  
&gt; Three cameras were pointed at a television playing the contents of another SCP-1250-2 sample. The contents of this sample included a [DATA EXPUNGED].
&gt; 
&gt; **Control tape:** The contents of the original SCP-1250-2 sample are seen clearly on the screen.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-2 tape (1):** The tape came out blank, having recorded no material.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-2 tape (2):** The tape came out blank, having recorded no material.

&gt; **Name:** Dr. ██████ And Dr. ████
&gt; **Date:** ██/██/199█
&gt; **Duration:** 00:13:24
&gt;  
&gt; Two cameras were set on a small table in the middle of a large concrete room, facing in opposite directions.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control tape:** The room remains empty, and nothing occurs for the entire duration of the film.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-2 tape:** A series of empty cans are thrown from behind the camera toward the wall by an unseen individual. This action persists for the entire duration of the recording.

&gt; **Name:** Dr. Carter
&gt; **Date:** ██/██/2006
&gt; **Duration:** 00:00:07
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Carter set up a group of 13 cameras to record him rolling a pair of six-sided dice. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Control tape:** Dice Result: 11
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-2 tape (1):** Dice Result: 3

&gt; **Name:** Agent H████, with Dr. Carter &amp; Dr. T████ monitoring.
&gt; **Date:** ██/██/200█
&gt; **Duration:** 00:00:23
&gt; 
&gt; Agent H████ was asked to fire 3 shots at Personnel D-32907 using his M9, from a distance of 22.5 meters. The Agent was also asked to intentionally try and avoid hitting D-329071 during the experiment, though this information was not shared with the subject.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control tape:** The first two shots miss the subject. The 3rd strikes him directly in the right shoulder, the subject clutching at the wound and reeling in pain before the recording ends.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-2 tape (1):** All 3 shots miss the subject without incident.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-2 tape (2):** All 3 shots contact with the subject&#39;s chest and abdomen, knocking them to the floor.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-2 tape (3):** Agent H████ is seen standing directly behind D-32907, with his firearm pressed against the backside of the subject&#39;s head. He fires a single shot, killing the subject instantly, and stares at the camera for the remainder of the recording.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-2 tape (4):** D-32907 is replaced with a specimen of [REDACTED]. Agent H████ is killed during the ensuing conflict.

&gt; **Name:** Dr. T████
&gt; **Date:** ██/██/200█
&gt; **Duration:** 09:14:36
&gt; 
&gt; Four cameras were left overnight in front of a television blaring static.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control tape:** The static is consistently seen for the duration of the tape.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-2 tape (1):** In place of the static, stock footage of spiders is seen. The majority of the footage focuses on the spiders capturing and eating prey.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-2 tape (2):** In place of the static, black and white footage of a deceased elderly man is seen. He sits slumped in a chair next to an ornate lamp, in a room devoid of any other furniture. At 00:05:06 his body begins falling to pieces, starting from the top down. This process is subtle at first, as it takes up until 09:12:00 to fully complete and is more easily observed when the footage is sped up.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-2 tape (3):** The television is off, and a lamp behind the camera can be seen in the television&#39;s reflection. A silhouetted figure is seen passing through the reflection on occasion.


&gt; **Name:** Dr. T████
&gt; **Date:** ██/██/200█
&gt; **Duration:** 06:28:38
&gt; 
&gt; Six cameras recorded several minutes of a Little League baseball game in Aberdeen, Maryland.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control tape:** Children play Little League baseball.  One team wears light blue jerseys while the other team wears yellow jerseys.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-2 tape (1):** Identical to control, except that a particular player wears the uniform number &#34;8&#34; instead of &#34;6&#34; per the control recording.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-2 tape (2):** Identical to control, except that a female spectator to the game has been replaced by [[[SCP-1229 | Lana Neal]]].
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-2 tape (3):** Identical to control, except that the position and orientation of the shadows of objects shown in the recording suggests the presence of more than one sun-like source of illumination.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-2 tape (4):** Rules of game appear to have changed - pitcher and fielding team seem to be throwing the ball at the batter&#39;s head with intent to injure, following which the batter chases the pitcher around the field, attempting to beat him with the bat.  Umpire, coaches and spectators appear to regard this behavior as normal.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-2 tape (5):** Identical to control, except that game participants and spectators appear to be reciting a prayer to Dažbog (Slavic pagan sun god) in the Old Church Slavonic language while playing.

&gt; **Name:** Dr. T████ with [REDACTED]
&gt; **Date:** ██/██/2010
&gt; **Duration:** 01:12:01
&gt; 
&gt; 24 hours prior to this experiment, Dr. T████ was the victim of an unfortunate car crash, and was rushed to ████ ██████ Hospital, under Foundation custody. Dr. T████ had previously asked to have his final moments captured on tape by SCP-1250-2, in the event of a fatal injury or terminal illness.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control tape:** Dr. T████ remains motionless in his hospital bed for the duration of the recording. Nurses are seen rushing in at 00:43:05 in response to his heart monitor flat-lining. Despite their best efforts, Dr. T████&#39;s heartbeat is not restored, and he is pronounced deceased at 1:09:15.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1250-2 tape:** Dr. T████ is conscious during the initial portions of the recording, and is seen discussing something with one of the nurses before she exits the room at 00:25:54. Dr. Carter is seen walking into frame at 00:43:05, and quickly proceeds to smother his colleague with a nearby pillow. Dr. T████ struggles against the attempted suffocation, but he is easily overpowered by Carter, and falls still at 01:09:15. Dr. Carter exits the room following the confrontation, and is not seen for the remainder of the recording.
&gt; 
&gt; //Following the events of the above experiment, the project has been handed over to Dr. Carter. He has requested that no further SCP-1250-2 experimentation be performed for the time being.//</textarea></pre>
