Altitudes
[[/div]]

A pale, sickly organism lay shivering in a pool of growth fluid.

The machines all around its empty gestation tube beeped in alarm, wires and cannulae strewn about, monitors detached from its chest after the fall. Two hearts pulsed weakly inside, trying to circulate the cyanohematoic fluid in its veins; they strained against the intense pull of Kepler&#39;s gravity.

Technicians flooded the room. This creature, the project requested by the higher-up, had just gone from poor quality to completely disastrous.

&#34;Why&#39;s it out of its tank--?&#34;

&#34;Uh, I don&#39;t know, but ████ is going to be furious. It&#39;s not supposed to look like that.&#34;

[[tab Add work to the hub + Character roster]]
So, you&#39;ve taken an interest! We&#39;re glad to have you here.

There are no rules for contributing per se, **as long as it included Kepler or its aliens**, but reading enough about pertinent story elements is recommended. For example, if you&#39;d like to write a piece about SCP-6118 encountering Kepler&#39;s megafauna, it would be a good idea to familiarise yourself with the planet&#39;s ecosystem.

[[*user tiredsn0w]] is more than happy to answer any Kepler-related questions you have, whether they&#39;re on the basis of its politics, language, cuisine, or the strange and fascinating biology of the keploids that live on its crust. You can reach out via Wikidot PM anytime.

To add an entry, simply copy and paste this template wherever in the listings your piece fits. These are all organised chronologically, as is the point of having this hub in the first place, so please keep that in mind when adding your work.

Don&#39;t know which tab to put it under? Anything taking place in 5a82&#39;s life at or before the Academy, in his initial occupation and then being on a squad with 4b80 and 7cb7, et cetera is going to under &#34;**Identity**&#34;. Anything taking place around his arrival on Earth and his time under containment by the Foundation is &#34;**Isolation**&#34; and his meeting SCP-049 and other loved ones is &#34;**Intimacy**&#34; (which are currently under the same tab). Anything taking place around or after his return to his home planet would be &#34;**Generativity**&#34;. Anything with an unclear chronological place in the story-- for example a related collection of oneshots that take place during differing times, like the RomCon Tales-- most likely goes under &#34;**Extras**&#34;. Again, feel free to contact [[*user tiredsn0w]] if you have any questions on where to place it.

[[tab SCP-6118&#39;s Place in the Sociopolitics of Kepler]]
An [[*user Alzin Cdag]] Essay

In the same way that Earth governments rule by virtue of their military and thus theoretical ability to protect their own people, the Kepler government rules by virtue of its monopoly on medicine. The military is small; the main use of the military is to destroy startup hospitals and other folks who want to start spreading medical knowledge.

The government presents itself as more valuable to be with than against; if the government fell, or if you cut yourself off from it, you would have nobody to take care of you when you get sick. It therefore does do the minimum and more than the minimum for all the disabled Ones.

I imagine the situation with the Twos, on the other hand, is much like the situation with the robots in Isaac Asimov&#39;s //The Caves of Steel//. Of course, the government values them over Ones for use in its wetwork, for maximum loyalty and minimum people outside missing them, or having to know about the trauma; but their symbolic value is much greater.

The government presents Twos as their own race of super-Keplerian. Ones are meant to look on them with envy, and to work harder in order to prove their own equality with the Twos, or to submit to more and more medical procedures (thus becoming further and further indebted to the government) in order to become more and more idealized, more and more perfect. To mix a feeling of rightful superiority with the feeling of present inferiority, the government assures the Ones that Twos have no feelings and are like robots. In this framework, Ones secretly admire Twos for their perfection and therefore despise them for imperfection.

But I think this gives a greater social context to [[[Spliced]]]. On the surface of the story, the rebels only needed a Two- any Two- to put in their experiment to create the Asu, and 5a82 was just the first one they happened to recruit. His aides 3f22 and 3f23 just came a bit later.

However, I don&#39;t think this is the case.

I think, no matter how versed in science the rebels were, they still had an ingrained religious awe about what the government was able to do with medicine. They are scared of interfering with the genetic code that is sacred, perfect.

When 5a82 enters, his existence throws all that into disarray. He is living proof of the fallibility of the government&#39;s process, that those in charge of the medicine there are merely mortal and prone to make mistakes. His imperfection is a signal of the fallibility of the virus.

He is also needed because nobody wants to experiment on &#34;perfect&#34; Twos, because of the remains of that religious awe. It is better to modify an existing blasphemy than pervert something already holy.

When he ends up saving them, they begin to transfer their religious awe to him. Every mortal has a religion, whether it be atheism, Unitarianism or Islam, and since the rebellion is necessarily bereft of the cult of the government, they fashion him as their new idol. This explains the transition between people being rude to him in Spliced and in awe of him in MNM.
