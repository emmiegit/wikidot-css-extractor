**Input:** Personnel File of MT Johnson
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Two documents. One is a wanted list by Interpol, dated August 31, 203█, including MT Johnson, researchers Isaac D., Dr. Cleveland, Dr. Veritas, Dr. Gears, Dr. Rights, O5-█, O5-██, the entire Bright family, and Administrators [DATA EXPUNGED].

Documents confirmed to be from a parallel universe in which the Foundation collapsed in 20██, likely from the same universe as //The Eleventh Hour//, as the book mentioned that the trial of O5-█ was ongoing in its epilogue.

//Note: I will need a Class-A amnestic for this. And it&#39;s just the Fine setting! You snarky ████████████, 914. -Dr. Cleveland//

//Note: Documents were directly handed to O5-█ due to its severity. - Site Command//

**Input:** One Aforementioned Air Rifle
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One custom Daisy &#34;Red Ryder&#34; carbine-action, two hundred shot Range Model air rifle with a compass and sundial in the stock.  The rifle was briefly tested on the firing range, determined to be non-anomalous, and produced results which were within one standard deviation of a normal Red Ryder.

//Note: At this point, Researcher Reis instructed that the rifle be tested at the firing range while she retrieved something, and left the testing chamber.  She returned with a thumb drive and added an impromptu step to the end of planned procedure.//

**Input:** One Aforementioned Air Rifle
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One Daisy &#34;Buck Jones&#34; Air Rifle.  When test-fired, the actual muzzle velocity was equivalent to the maximum muzzle velocity of an average Buck Jones rifle.  Shots were also more accurate at range despite being smooth-bore.  No other anomalous properties were detected.

**Input:** One Aforementioned Air Rifle
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One Gaussian Handcannon with a miniature sextant and a spring-powered clock in the butt.  Weight was equivalent to input rifle. Clock is functional but unwound, ammunition and batteries were not included.  Object being tested for anomalous properties prior to test-firing.

**Input:** A pair of &#34;Versace&#34; brand spectacles
**Setting:** Very fine
**Output:** One knife with a glass blade. When used to cut something, it will heat up to roughly 3000°C. This heat is strong enough to cut iron, gold and steel, and has proven to be a great weapon, if not completely deadly as the heat from the blade completely cauterizes the wound, stopping external bleeding but causing severe internal bleeding. Strangely, the heat does not seem to affect the holder of the knife, who does not need to wear any protective gear or get any burns on their body. Further analysis needed. It is currently being held in the Site-37 armory.

//Huh, would have guessed another controller from a different console. -Researcher Ed//

**Input:** 1 Gamecube Controller
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One Generic Gamecube controller. When used, the plastic seems to form to support the user&#39;s hand. Additionally, all buttons except for the shoulder buttons have an extremely short travel distance, and therefore responsiveness.

//Upon prolonged use, the controller heated up and fused with another researcher&#39;s hand, causing fourth-degree burns, and destroying itself in the process.//

**Input:** Two Gamecube controllers
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One Generic Gamecube controller. However, when collected, the controller appeared to fuse with Researcher Ed&#39;s hand quickly, causing 5th-degree burns. After the fusing &#34;process&#34; finished, Researcher Ed&#39;s hands had become black, amorphous objects. Upon a medical examination, it appears that his hands have completely disappeared. Examination of the black amorphous objects have shown that it contains some kind of alloy, additionally, it appears Researcher Ed has a degree of control shaping the objects into an imaginable solid made of the alloy. Further testing is required.

//This is a weird feeling. I can feel whatever these touch, even though they aren&#39;t fingers. Also it really hurt. It&#39;s also an experience relearning to type and write with these &#34;fingers&#34; -Researcher Ed//

**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One $1 USD coin, which appears to have been made by tightly compressing the original paper bill into the shape of a coin.

**Input:** One bill
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One &#34;-$1&#34; USD bill, which largely resembles a standard $1 USD bill except that all instances of &#34;1&#34; are replaced with &#34;-1&#34;, and the print&#39;s color has been inverted as if it were a photonegative of the original bill. It is assumed that this bill represents a negative amount of currency but otherwise displays no abnormal properties.

//Note: Still having trouble wrapping my head around how this would work in normal economics. - Dr. Natalidae//

**Input:** One bill
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One visually unaltered $1 bill. When assigned D-Class was about to retrieve the output, it autonomously shifted out of his reach. Subsequent attempts to capture the output were met with similar resistance, with it rapidly outmanoeuvring anyone who came near it. The bill was able to escape the testing chamber and went out into the halls of Facility 23, where it spent a total of 43 minutes eluding capture attempts until several researchers coordinated to corner and trap it in the incinerator room, where it was promptly disposed of.

**Input:** Above materials
**Setting:** fine
**Output:** 1 piece of ink-soggy sheet music, 1 toppled over jar of ink. Surprisingly, there does appear to be notes placed on the lines, and further examination shows it to be an excerpt of Franz Liszt&#39;s etude &#34;La Campanella&#34;. It is unknown if the jar of ink tipping over was accidental or purposeful work of SCP-914.

//Note: Well, It **did** technically qualify for the results of the experiment, but now I&#39;m wondering why it would choose such a weird etude to print, considering it was one of the etudes where it&#39;s artist was accused of selling their soul to the devil just to print and play it.//

Farrell (//Richard Nixon: The Life//), //An American Life// authored by former President Ronald Reagan, //Known and Unknown: A Memoir// by Donald Rumsfeld

**Input:** All of the above
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** Four books:
1. A book titled //They Led Us to Midnight: The Last Presidents of America//, authored by Doris Goodwin, dated 2015. This book mentions the last presidents of the United States as Richard Nixon (1969-1977, 37th), Jerry Brown (1977-1981, 38th), Ronald Reagan (1981-1985, 39th), Mary Talish (1985-1989, 40th), and Donald Rumsfeld (1989-1993, 41st). The 25 years were marred with controversy, and culminated with a nuclear war with the Soviet Union under Gennady Yanayev (General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union 1985-1993) after a nuclear false alarm on November 22, 1993. It was stated that a system malfunction in the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1984 Dead Hand / Perimeter nuclear weapons control system] misinterpreted a background signal as 6 Minuteman ICBMs heading for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, thus causing the nuclear war.
2. An autobiography titled //Murder, They Wrote// by Mary Talish, dated 1992. It details her ritual murder and subsequent resurrection in 1952, her senatorial career from 1967 to 1977, her vice presidency from 1977 to 1981, and her presidency from 1985 to 1989. A foreword, written by Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter, suggested that American-Soviet relations deteriorated rapidly after Talish&#39;s presidency ended.
3. A book titled //United Counties of Indiana: The Founding of a Nation// by Former Governor of Illinois James R. Thompson, dated 2015. It detailed the first twenty years of Indiana and Illinois after the Nuclear War of 1993. Of note was the appearance of Site-81 Director Oliver J. Rights as President of Indiana from 2007 to 2011.
4. An autobiography titled //Our Struggle: Memories of Athens// by Alexis Tsipras, Prime Minister of the Imperial Union of Greece, [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1173 Samothrace], Cyprus and Turkey (Greek: Η Αυτοκρατορική Ένωση της Ελλάδας, η Σαμοθράκη, η Κύπρος και η Τουρκία), dated 2020. It detailed his life from after the nuclear war, being one of the few who witnessed a nuclear bomb hitting Athens without exploding. The current monarch is Paul II (Pavlos II), following Constantine II&#39;s abdication in 1996 in exchange for the restoration of the Greek Monarchy.
In books 1 and 4, a world map is seen. One could infer that continental Eurasia, the British Isles, the former Soviet Union, and North America is heavily devastated. All four placed into secure storage pending further review.
//Note: So it turns out that Mary Talish could have done much more in her life. However, a nuclear war is probably the last thing we would want to see. -Cleveland//

//Note: Since 914 at least partially operates by intent of the operator and purpose of the items inserted, I want to see how it reacts to a set of items with no single purpose. Don&#39;t worry, neither the log nor the fruit snacks contain any natural ingredients, so there&#39;s no chance of biological contamination.//

**Input:** All of the above
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One 20 cm cube of an unknown alloy. Testing shows it to be made up of an even mix of all of the input items. The alloy has a much worse structural stability than steel, as well as the anomalous properties of being flammable and gaining the same texture and hardness of a fruit snack when bitten into. However, the combination of materials making it up would mean that any attempt to eat any amount of it would almost certainly be fatal.

//Note: I wasn&#39;t expecting it to give me something as cohesive as this. It almost seems like it noticed that I was more interested in it rather than the stuff I was putting into it and didn&#39;t put much effort into refining the materials.

**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** The first item that came out was an anti-Foundation poster by the Christian Democratic Union, dated 2017. On it was the Foundation logo with a Swastika in the middle. The texts read &#34;Secure. Contain. --Protect.-- Exterminate.&#34; (//Sichern. Enthalten. --Schützen.-- Vernichten.//), &#34;Never Forget the Holocaust.&#34; (//Vergiss Niemals den Holocaust.//), and &#34;Vote for the Union Parties.&#34; (//Stimmen Sie für die Unionsparteien.//) It should be noted that according to //The Eleventh Hour//, Germany was part of the United States-led Bloomington Alliance (other important members included Poland, Italy and India, with Russia being in an associated state status), which uprooted much of the SCP Foundation in a ten-year war (it was a few years after the war ended when the titular military operation took place).
The second item was a political commentary by Popular Socialist Party of Mexico Chairwoman [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4669 Esther Amalia Zapatista] titled //Our Ultimate Revolution: 13 Reasons Why Capitalism Will Fail//, dated 2047. In the book, Ms. Zapatista claimed that the existing Capitalist world is fundamentally flawed, and with the possible yet controversial exceptions of Cuba, Finland, Iceland, and Estonia, no country has came close to attaining real, egalitarian Socialism. The opening quote of the book, &#34;You don&#39;t walk away from Gethsemane&#34;, implies that blood would be shed on the path to achieving Socialism.

**Test 914-0380**
**Name:** Dr. Fiael, MD
**Date:** 30/01/2019
**Total Items:** 5 complete //SynCardia^^[[size 85%]]TM[[/size]]^^// brand total artificial hearts (TAH)

**Input:** 1 TAH
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** Pile of plastic (biocompatible), Velcro, magnets of varying shape and size, and a patent for the device printed on squares of antimicrobial cloth, which appear in several languages (English, Chinese, German, Japanese).

**Input:** 1 TAH
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** A metallic box that has four chambers of equal size and outflow valves to and from each. The chambers are lined on all interior surfaces with biocompatibale plastic. Attached to the exterior of the box is a handle, which is attached to a crank. The crank moves fluid through the box for as long as manual force is applied to it.

**Input:** 1 TAH
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** Two ventricular assist devices, one intended for placement in the right side of the heart; the other intended for placement in the left side of the heart.

//Note: The output machines each take the function of the heart&#39;s pumping action. The one intended for the right side of the heart isn&#39;t used much in practice due to high risk of complications, which is why the TAH was created. Essentially, 1 artificial heart = two [[$ \frac{1}{2} $]] artificial hearts.//

**Input:** 1 TAH
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Nothing is initially observed in the output chamber. Closer inspection of the surfaces shows a thin accumulation of dust that was not present previously. The dust is later revealed to be millions of individual nanoparticulate mechanisms. Chemical analysis of the immediate environment as well as shavings of the output chamber&#39;s interior reveal a significant increase in oxygen and extrinsic nutrients.

//Note: The purpose of the cardiovascular system is to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the tissues. The nanoparticles apparently achieve this via controlled diffusion, without the need for an organ or delivery system.//

**Input:** 1 TAH
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** Native materials of the TAH have been rearranged to resemble several fruits and vegetables (inedible). A perfectly functioning pedometer was also retrieved.

//Note: Seems to be suggesting preventative care.//

**Input:** 1 abridged copy of MT Johnson&#39;s personnel file
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One large origami wrench embossed with the words &#34;Secure, Maintain, Protect&#34;

//Note: About what I expected, but that&#39;s not the Foundation&#39;s actual slogan. Perhaps it&#39;s my perception of it? - MT Johnson//

**Input:** 1 abridged copy of MT Johnson&#39;s personnel file
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** The file now contains several pages of the word &#34;maintain&#34; handwritten over and over in printer ink. Writing confirmed as identical to that of MT Johnson. Writing starts out normally but gets rougher and rougher as it progresses, as well as containing an increasing number of capital letters. By the end it is barely legible as well as being entirely capitalized. The folder has what appears to be an emblem made up of a pair of crossed wrenches pressed into it&#39;s front and back as well.

//Note: This feels like its from the typewriter scene from// The Shining. //I&#39;m just going to leave this in secure storage and try to forget that this ever happened. - MT Johnson//

**Total Items:** Three 1 dram samples of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-837 SCP-837]

**Input:** 1 dram of SCP-837, rolled into a ball.
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** The entire 3mx2.1mx2.1m output chamber was initially filled with clay, with small lines noticeable along the surface. Upon applying slight pressure to empty the chamber, the clay began collapsing in on itself, eventually setting down to a single dram of clay. Final sample demonstrates consistent properties of SCP-837.

**Input:** 1 dram of SCP-837, rolled into a ball.
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** 2 clay balls of different sizes, measured as weighing 2 drams and 0.5 drams. Both balls were able to have 1 dram chunks removed without affecting mass, consistent with SCP-837. While the 2 dram ball could be combined and removed as normal, adding the 0.5 dram sample to a 3 dram sample resulted in a 1.5 dram sample which could not be restored. Adding the 2 dram sample resulted in a standard 3 dram sample, which could not be further factorized.

**Input:** 1 dram of SCP-837, rolled into a ball
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** 1 clay ball, weighing 1 pennyweight, exhibiting similar features to SCP-837. Sample could not be combined with standard instances of SCP-837.
