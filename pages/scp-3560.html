[[include component:image-block name=forest.jpg|caption= SCP-3560&#39;s interior.]]

**Item #:** SCP-3560

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to its proximity to an existing Foundation containment site, SCP-3560 is currently contained by [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-64|Site-64]]] staff. All trails leading to SCP-3560 are to be closed to public access via a cover story of a severe landslide. Civilians attempting to access SCP-3560&#39;s location are to be detained by security personnel under the guise of Portland Park Rangers. Use of Class-A amnestics on detained civilians has been approved.

**Description:** SCP-3560 is a Class-3 interdimensional portal located within Forest Park, Portland, Oregon. The portal itself resembles an ellipse made of white fog standing vertically on its end, with an approximate length of 1 m along the major axis. Physical objects that approach SCP-3560 from either face can enter its interior.

The interior of SCP-3560 is a monochrome temperate forest. While plants located within SCP-3560&#39;s interior are made of biological material, they do not undergo cellular processes typical to similar non-anomalous plants. The entirety of SCP-3560&#39;s interior is covered in a constant fog that restricts visibility to approximately 40 m. Despite having no apparent light sources, SCP-3560&#39;s interior is lit at a constant illuminance of approximately 3 lux. The full size of SCP-3560&#39;s interior is currently unknown, with no exploration attempt locating a perimeter. 

SCP-3560&#39;s interior is inhabited by multiple automatons resembling the product models of [[[Anderson Robotics Hub|Anderson Robotics]]] in various states of disrepair[[footnote]]Observed damage has included gunshot wounds, missing limbs, malfunctioning weapons and propulsion systems, and missing/damaged chassis.[[/footnote]] (here after referred to as instances of SCP-3560-1). SCP-3560-1 are frequently hostile to human life, particularly Foundation personnel, and have proven indestructible while within SCP-3560. Attempts to capture instances of SCP-3560-1 and remove them from within SCP-3560 have been met with failure, as all instances become intangible and vanish shortly upon exiting SCP-3560&#39;s interior.

--Exploration of SCP-3560&#39;s interior is currently ongoing.-- Exploration of SCP-3560&#39;s interior has been suspended indefinitely.

**Addendum 3560-A: Exploration Log 3560-3**
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Show Log&#34; hide=&#34;- Hide Log&#34;]]
&gt; **Exploration Video Log Transcript**
&gt; **Date:** 11/15/2026
&gt; **Exploration Team:** Mobile Task Force Gamma-13 (“Asimov&#39;s Lawbringers”)
&gt; **Subject:** SCP-3560
&gt; **Team Lead:** γ-13 Shaw
&gt; **Team Members:** γ-13  Sherman, γ-13 Carter, γ-13 Lopez
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** //Due to their experience with Anderson Robotics, MTF Gamma-13 was tasked to enter SCP-3560 and attempt to locate any perimeter, and if possible, capture an instance of SCP-3560-1. All team members were equipped with standard issue tracking devices, body cameras and microphones. Due to low visibility, a tracking beacon was set up at the entrance to SCP-3560&#39;s interior to allow team members to find their way back. All team members were equipped with physical tethers in case of beacon failure. Members of MTF Tau-51 (&#34;Urban Brawl&#34;) were on standby outside SCP-3560 to provide MTF Gamma-13 with assistance during extraction. Video feed begins right after MTF Gamma-13 has entered SCP-3560.//
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13 Shaw:** Mics on.
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13 Carter:** Christ this place is creepy. You can&#39;t see more than 20 feet out.
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13 Lopez:** You gotta use metric, man. We talked about this.
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13 Carter:** Bite me. The scientists can convert that measurement later if they so please. Let&#39;s just go.
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13  Sherman:** Where&#39;re we off to, anyway?
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13 Shaw:** Compasses still work in here, so we&#39;ve been instructed to head dead south. Tau-51 and [[[Wayfarers Hub|Eta-13]]] already checked to the north and to the west. See if we can find any kind of perimeter to this place.
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13 Lopez:** Groovy. And if we don&#39;t find one?
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13 Shaw:** Then we don&#39;t find one. Let&#39;s go.
&gt; 
&gt; //MTF Gamma-13 begins to head south. Due to the fog, visibility on screen is limited. Exploration remains uneventful for approximately 20 minutes until a series of mechanical chirps become audible. Team members begin to pan around to find its source.//
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13  Sherman:** Anyone see them?
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13 Lopez:** Got visual! Three Merlins in that tree.
&gt; 
&gt; //Cameras pan to a nearby tree. Perched on a low hanging limb are three instances of SCP-3560-1 resembling AR Merlin Aerial Drones. The units continue to chirp, looking back and forth between themselves and Gamma-13//
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13 Carter:** They&#39;re acting like birds...
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13 Lopez:** Shit, that sound&#39;s going to attract some of the nastier units. Shaw?
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13 Shaw:** Don&#39;t engage. They haven&#39;t attacked us yet. Last thing we want to do is kick the whole hornet&#39;s nest because a few bugs started buzzing. We&#39;ll just keep moving.
&gt; 
&gt; //MTF Gamma-13 resumes its exploration. The instances of SCP-3560-1 remain in place, watching the team until they disappear into the fog. The sound of their propulsion systems become audible shortly afterwards, and then fade into the distance.//
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13 Carter:** That&#39;s probably not a good thing.
&gt; 
&gt; //MTF Gamma-13&#39;s exploration continues in silence for the next 10 minutes.//
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13 Lopez:** So, I got to ask, what is the plan if we run into a Taita unit in here? Those things are hard to kill on the outside, let alone when they are indestructible.
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13 Shaw:** They can still be incapacitated with traditional methods, Lopez. They just don&#39;t die. 
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13 Lopez:** Meaning?
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13  Sherman:** Meaning that shooting them buys you about 15 minutes to run before they repair and are back up again. So let&#39;s not start anything that ends in a heroic last stand, yeah?
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13 Shaw:** Shit! Get down!
&gt; 
&gt; //MTF Gamma-13 takes cover and remains silent. After five minutes, an instance of SCP-3560-1 resembling an AR Aplomado Facility Defense Unit wanders by. The instance stops, looks around for several moments, then moves on. MTF Gamma-13 remain hidden for several additional minutes before quietly moving on. Exploration resumes.//
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13 Carter:** Well, that was close...
&gt; 
&gt; //A mechanical siren is heard from behind MTF Gamma-13. Cameras pan to see the previous SCP-3560-1 instance charging from behind, and begins to open fire on the team with its armaments. MTF Gamma-13 take cover behind various trees and returns fire, eventually incapacitating the instance. The sound of more sirens can be heard as an additional nine instances of SCP-3560-1 appear from behind MTF Gamma-13. All nine instances resemble Aplomado units as well.//
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13  Sherman:** Holy hell!
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13 Shaw:** Get back to the entrance, now! We&#39;re scrapping! Tau-51 be ready for extraction support!
&gt; 
&gt; //MTF Gamma-13 begins to flee back towards the entrance to SCP-3560&#39;s interior. The instances of SCP-3560-1 open fire upon as they pursue the agents.//
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13 Lopez:** Fuck, I&#39;m hit!
&gt; 
&gt; //γ-13 Lopez tumbles to the ground. His body camera pans to show several bullet wounds to his left leg. He attempts to crawl toward the SCP-3560&#39;s entrance.//
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13  Shaw:** Sherman! Carter!
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13  Sherman:** On it!
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13  Carter:** Fuuuuuuuuuuuuck!
&gt; 
&gt; //The remainder of MTF Gamma-13 provide γ-13 Lopez covering fire. In the exchange, γ-13  Sherman is injured. γ-13  Carter and γ-13  Shaw begin to drag their downed team members.//
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13  Carter:** Where the hell is Tau-51?
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13  Shaw:** Hell if I know! Just keep going!
&gt; 
&gt; //There is the sound of several more sirens. MTF Gamma-13 stops. Cameras pan to show that they are now surrounded by fifteen SCP-3560-1 instances resembling Aplomado units. All instances remain still.//
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13  Shaw:** Oh god...
&gt; 
&gt; //Several additional instances of SCP-3560-1 resembling Peregrine Humanoid Utility Droids and Saker Androids approach MTF Gamma-13. One of the Peregrine instances, with the serial number &#34;31&#34; woven into its left arm then speaks to the agents. This instance has several patches of its aramid covering missing.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3560-1:** First you torment us there, and now you come and torment us here? Will it never end?
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13  Shaw:** [[[SCP-1360|1360?]]]
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3560-1:** I was. You shouldn&#39;t have come here.
&gt; 
&gt; **γ-13  Shaw:** If you harm us, you will face retaliation. You should know that.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3560-1:** I&#39;m aware. You&#39;re not expendable like we were. It&#39;s part of the plan.
&gt; 
&gt; //The SCP-3560-1 instances then depart, leaving MTF Gamma-13 surrounded by the SCP-3560-1 instances resembling Aplomado units. Several sirens become audible once again, as the SCP-3560-1 in stances arm their weapons systems and take aim.//
&gt; 
&gt; **τ-51 Creed:** Engage!
&gt; 
&gt; //Cameras pan around as MTF Tau-51 arrives and engages the SCP-3560-1 instances. After a several minute long firefight, the instances are incapacitated. Members of Tau-51 begin to assist MTF Gamma-13 with extraction.//

**Addendum 3560-B: Interview 3560-1**
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Show Interview&#34; hide=&#34;- Hide Interview&#34;]]
&gt; //The following interview was conducted as part of MTF Gamma-13&#39;s investigation following the events of the third exploration attempt of SCP-3560&#39;s interior, and the appearance of two more instances of SCP-3560 within Forest Park.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewed: PoI-1115 &#34;Vincent Anderson&#34;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer: MTF Commander Clarissa Shaw**
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** The following interview was conducted during MTF Gamma-13&#39;s investigation into SCP-3560&#39;s origin, as well as the relationship between SCP-3560-1 instances and Anderson Robotics and its products.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Shaw:** Afternoon, Vincent.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-1115:** Ah, Clarissa. It&#39;s been so long. How are you these days? How&#39;s Sasha doing?
&gt; 
&gt; **Shaw:** My personal life is hardly any concern of yours, Vincent. There has been a development. I&#39;m here to ask you some questions.
&gt; 
&gt; //PoI-1115 tsks.//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-1115:** Always so formal. What&#39;s in it for me?
&gt; 
&gt; **Shaw:** Labelle is prepared to offer you a few of the components you requested from your repair list, assuming your answers are satisfactory.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-1115:** How can I help, then?
&gt; 
&gt; //Shaw slides PoI-1115 a file containing a briefing on SCP-3560.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Shaw:** A type of portal opened in Forest Park. Inside are several entities resembling your products, Vincent. Any ideas why that might be?
&gt; 
&gt; //PoI-1115 laughs.//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-1115:** Oh my, I didn&#39;t think this kind of thing could actually happen. Holy shit.
&gt; 
&gt; **Shaw:** You have an idea what is going on then?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-1115:** Kind of, yeah. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Shaw:** Enlighten us.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-1115:** Well, I&#39;ve already told you guys that how our robots worked was closer to zapping a soul into a brain-dead body than it was traditional robotics tech. The thing is, if you destroy that body, that soul is still going to be hanging around. It&#39;s got to go somewhere. Hence...
&gt; 
&gt; **Shaw:** So, the entities inside the portal are...
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-1115:** Robot souls, yeah.
&gt; 
&gt; **Shaw:** Okay, but why Forest Park? Why isn&#39;t this portal located somewhere else? Why is it a temperate forest inside?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-1115:** I mean, why do ghosts haunt the places they died? Between that [[[The Blackbird and The Falcon|raid]]] on [[[Three Portlands Hub|Three Portlands]]] and those experiments you guys did at Site-64, you guys killed a lot of robots. I imagine there&#39;s a lot of anger in those places. As for the forest, I&#39;m guessing it used to be a pocket dimension that bubbled off of Three Ports that they commandeered en masse. It&#39;s not like anyone else was probably using it. And if they were, I can promise you they probably aren&#39;t using it now.
&gt; 
&gt; **Shaw:** So how do we stop it?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-1115:** Pardon?
&gt; 
&gt; **Shaw:** More of these portals have been appearing. How do we stop that?
&gt; 
&gt; //PoI-1115 shrugs.//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-1115:** Not a clue. Last I checked you can&#39;t really destroy one of these souls once you make it. They&#39;re kind of like the Styrofoam of the spirit world. An exorcist, maybe? [[[prometheus-labs-hub|Prometheus Labs]]] had a [[[grant-request-for-utilization-of-electro-thaumic-computers-t|project]]] they&#39;re working on that might do the trick. I&#39;d be careful though. If you bother this hornet&#39;s nest enough times the hornets are going to attack. Create enough hostile energy and they&#39;ll probably start spilling out of there. And they&#39;ll be pissed.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Addendum 3560-C: Incident 3560-4**

On 12/3/2027 an additional four instances of SCP-3560 manifested, with two forming within Site-64&#39;s staff dormitories and two within the Unusual Incidents Unit&#39;s Three Portlands Headquarters, bringing the total number of instances to eight. Instances of SCP-3560-1 were observed to be capable of leaving SCP-3560&#39;s interior as Level 4 Apparitions, and [[[Hector and Jacob|abducted]]] a total of twelve [[[unusual-incidents-unit-hub|UIU]]] and Site-64 personnel[[footnote]]All personnel abducted had previous experience as employees of Anderson Robotics prior to defecting following the company&#39;s collapse.[[/footnote]].

Use of Hoffman Portable Electro-Thaumic Units[[footnote]]Reverse engineered from earlier Prometheus Labs designs.[[/footnote]] proved effective in exorcising these SCP-3560-1 instances. Investigation into means of [[[Assault on Site-64|closing additional SCP-3560 instances]]] is currently ongoing. 

Attempts to enter SCP-3560 and rescue abducted personnel has so far been met with limited success. The remains of four of the twelve abducted personnel have been recovered from within SCP-3560 in various states of mutilation:

||~ Personnel Name ||~ Current Position ||~ Former Position ||~ State on Recovery ||
|| Debora Stevens || Foundation: AIAD Programmer || Anderson Robotics Advanced Logic Division || Found strung from a tree via aramid fibers. Subject appeared to have had multiple strips of flesh removed from his body. ||
|| Charles Freeman || Foundation: Paratech Development || Anderson Robotics Research and Development || Found in a clearing. Subject had been exsanguinated[[footnote]]Completely drained of blood.[[/footnote]]. ||
|| Arav Jindal || UIU: Surveillance Specialist || Anderson Robotics Research and Development || Found dismembered over a distance of 1 km. ||
|| Mari Tanaka || UIU: Public Relations || Anderson Robotics Customer Liaison || Found adjacent to a SCP-3560 entryway. Subject had her skin removed and was revealed to be an Anderson Robotics Saker Android. Subject was unresponsive, with her internal AI heavily corrupted.||

Each recovered individual was found bearing a heart symbol with a jagged line running down its center sewn into their back with aramid fibers. Attempts to locate the remaining abducted personnel is ongoing.
