    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Item #:** SCP-3145

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3145 is to be contained in a secure holding cell in Research Sector-22. Removal from its cell must be approved by at least one Level 2 or higher personnel, at which time SCP-3145 is to be heavily sedated, secured by an iron collar guided by two 2 m long iron poles held by 2 separate Level 1 personnel, and escorted by 2 armed guards. Any experiments conducted with SCP-3145 are to be performed in specially prepared rooms. (See Document 3145-D-3-18.)

SCP-3145&#39;s cell must be monitored at all times via camera. Any abnormal behavior should immediately be reported to Dr. Falzon. Any complaints are to be ignored.

All instances of SCP-3145-1 are to be terminated on sight.

**Description:** SCP-3145 is humanoid in appearance, 1.9 m high and 95.3 kg. Further description is unavailable due to its form being obscured by a heavy cloak and mask in the style of a traditional 17th century Plague doctor&#39;s costume. Though this covering has the texture of leather and ceramic, testing shows it is in fact part of SCP-3145&#39;s body, with a composition similar to muscle fiber.

SCP-3145 is generally completely docile unless it is performing surgery. When a human (hereafter referred to as the victim) comes into contact with SCP-3145&#39;s hands, the victim suffers [DATA LOST] and dies. SCP-3145 will then attempt to kill any other humans in the area through the same means before returning to the original victim. It will produce a bag containing various medical implements, including several vials of an as-yet unidentified substance, from within in its body and begin dissecting and injecting various chemicals into the victim. After approximately 20 minutes, SCP-3145 will sew the incision shut and become docile once again, though it often grumbles about the ineffectiveness of its technique. The victim will then resume vital signs and reanimate, becoming an instance of SCP-3145-1.

SCP-3145-1 seem to be normal humans but lack higher brain functions. When alone or with SCP-3145, SCP-3145-1 will wander aimlessly. When encountering a living human, SCP-3145-1 will enter a state marked by extremely heightened endorphin and adrenaline levels and attempt to kill any and all humans it can find, returning to its sedate state afterward. SCP-3145-1 can be terminated by standard firearms, though they are considerably more resistant to bullets than standard humans.

**Addendum: Interview 3145-01**

&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-3145
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Ksenia T. Falzon, Head Researcher, Research Sector-22
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** SCP-3145 began speaking without provocation on 03/04/2008 while en route to a testing facility. This was the first time SCP-3145 had ever been observed speaking. Dr. Falzon was able to record the conversation with a handheld dictation device.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log, 13:57&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3145:** Okay, get me out of here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Falzon:** Excuse me?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3145:** This mask smells like shit. My body feels like a rubber boot.
&gt; 
&gt; **Falzon:** I&#39;m sorry, I do not understand the request.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3145:** Killing people, just, boom, dead. That&#39;s not very interesting. And then I turn them into zombies or something? I don&#39;t even know. But they suck ass at what they do and your goons are too good at putting them down.
&gt; 
&gt; **Falzon:** SCP-3145, please calm down or I will order the guards to restrain you with force.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3145:** Stop pretending like you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about! I&#39;m ready to move on.
&gt; 
&gt; **Falzon:** //[pauses]// This is what you wanted, though, isn&#39;t it? Did you think everything was going to be fun and games? Did you think you didn&#39;t deserve any kind of punishment for what you&#39;ve done?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3145:** Fuck you.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log, 14:02&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** SCP-3145 refused to speak after this incident. Scheduled test was aborted after SCP-3145 refused to utilize its anomalous abilities on provided D-Class and coercive tactics were unsuccessful. SCP-3145 was returned to its enclosure. Investigation into its sudden change in mood is ongoing.</textarea></pre>
