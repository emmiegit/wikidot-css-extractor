&gt; //But after a thousand years of bondage, the people of Adi-üm had forgotten who they were. The Old Tongue was not spoken in the herding-camps. The shamans&#39; bloodlines knew the sacred rites of blood and bone no longer. Even ION had forgotten his own destiny, his true soul concealing itself even from him behind the mask of servitude. And so was Adi-üm forgotten for a time, as ION grew from boy to man, chained and alone.//
&gt; **//Sone Suraas//, Chapter 2**[[footnote]] From the Commentaries of Karcist Sulkisk, 1937: &#34;When we forget our destiny—as the true descendants of Adytum, the wake left in the waters of humanity by the passing of Ion—we forget ourselves.&#34; [[/footnote]]

&gt; //When Nadox was an infant, he saw another infant starve at his mother&#39;s empty breast so a noble girl could eat. When Nadox was a boy, he saw another boy beaten to death so a noble maiden could hear his screams. When Nadox was a youth, he saw another youth bleed to death so a noble matron could look young again. And when Nadox was a man, he saw another man starve a baby, and beat a boy, and bleed a youth, so a noble sorceress would give him her favor. And Nadox swore then that no more would die unless their death helped the many, not the few.//
&gt; **//Sone Suraas//, Chapter 4**[[footnote]] From the Commentaries of Karcist Sulkist, 1937: &#34;While this seems to be a staunchly populist message, even verging on Communism, the phrase &#39;the many, not the few&#39; (&#39;//sokh ma häv//&#39;) could also be translated as &#39;the full, not the empty&#39;; the Daevas are empty, soulless, sterile, dead, while their slaves are full, ensouled, diseased, alive. We, the Black-Blooded, are full of the bloodlines of our ancestors, teeming with the sacred parasites and cancers that we love; to paraphrase Whitman, we are large, and contain multitudes. The deaths of others are ours to use as we see fit.&#34; [[/footnote]]

&gt; //They tore out his tongue, so he could not speak; but he still gave sermons with his eyes, and with his hands, and with his beating heart. They sewed shut his lips, so he could not eat or drink; but he subsisted on truth, and on beauty, and on hope for ION. They cut off his testicles, so he could not breed; but his legacy lives on in his thoughts, and in his deeds, and in his living blood.//
&gt; **//Sone Suraas//, Chapter 7**[[footnote]] From the Commentaries of Karcist Vataarin, 2013: &#34;While some believe that Nadox&#39;s &#39;living blood&#39; is some relic of his life, perhaps an actual sample of the //Klavigar&#39;s// lifeblood, I believe it to be metaphorical: all the faithful of the Nälkä are the blood of Nadox, our struggles through the ages reflective of his own suffering. While his castration prevented him from founding his own bloodline, his influence on ION shaped the Old Blood and gave us our ideals.&#34; [[/footnote]]

**Component Name:** Tears of Nadox

**Short Description:** Component PP-NEU-0127-ST is an esoteric chemical produced from the processing of human pineal and lacrimal glands in a specially-prepared biological construct.

**Synthesis:** Component PP-NEU-0127-ST is produced by Product SB-KIR-0041, &#34;//Kiraak// of the Weeping Rite&#34;, via Ritual Process SOL-12, &#34;Rite of Blessed Weeping&#34; (detailed below). It is isolated and purified by means of Ritual Process ADW-32, &#34;Sulkisk&#39;s Sieve&#34;.

**Production History:** Component PP-NEU-0127-ST is an important reagent in several Solomonari Ritual Processes not currently used by the Group; before the creation of SB-KIR-0041, it was produced at a much less efficient rate using Product SB-KIR-0002, &#34;Next-Generation Flesh-Cauldron&#34;, or by the //Akuloth// of a descendant of the Old Blood who has undergone Ritual Process SOL-03, &#34;The Suffering of Nadox&#34;.

&gt; //Nadox wept. He wept for the children born into slavery. He wept for the men and women who would die before they could be freed. He wept for the warriors who would die for the freedom of others. He wept for ION most of all: ION who he had not met, ION who he would free, ION who would free him. But he did not weep for himself.//
&gt; **The Litany of Weeping, from //Sone Suraas//, Chapter 9**[[footnote]] From the Commentaries of Karcist Sulkist, 1937: &#34;When you fail, weep not for yourself, but for your ancestors; your victories are their victories, your failures their failures.&#34; [[/footnote]]
[[/=]]

**Name:** &#34;Blessed Weeping&#34; (Old Tongue: &#34;Kyenillë Syunatti&#34;)

**Origin:** The Carpathian Solomonari (via House Vörös and the Order of the White Worm)

**Material Requirements:**
* Several human pineal and lacrimal glands, preferably fresh[[footnote]] Current source: the Sky-Reaching Tree of [[[scp-2815|House Ivády]]]. Previously harvested from infants produced by Ritual Process SOL-07, &#34;Rite of the Broodmother&#34;. [[/footnote]] (the Offerings).
* A Völutaar of the Old Blood who has undergone Ritual Process SOL-03, &#34;The Suffering of Nadox&#34;[[footnote]] Not detailed in this document. In summary, a passage from the //Codex Solomonarorum//, 24: &#34;let the aspirant suffer as Wise Nadox suffered; let its tongue be removed, let its mouth be sewn up, let its genitals be nullified, let it be beaten and whipped and burnt; and let it cry not for itself, but for its tormentors.&#34; [[/footnote]] (the Sufferer).
* Either a Kiraak shaped for this ritual or SB-KIR-0002, &#34;Next-Generation Flesh-Cauldron&#34;[[footnote]] Essentially a portable Kiraak, modified from the form used by the Solomonari in the centuries after the knowledge of the Temple-Builder&#39;s Art was lost. [[/footnote]] (the Vessel).
* One bone needle.

**Products:**
* The Sacred Tears of Nadox the Wise (dilute in solution).

**Byroducts:**
* Human cerebrospinal fluid
* Assorted neurotransmitters
* Psychotropic compounds[[footnote]] Mainly psychedelic tryptamines, including N,N-DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, 4-PO-DMT (psilocybin) and 4-HO-DMT (psilocin). [[/footnote]]

**Procedure:**
# The Offerings are placed into the digestion basin(s) of the Vessel.
# The Sufferer&#39;s Akuloth releases a small amount of the Sacred Tears into their bloodstream, to act as a catalyst for the reaction.
#  The Sufferer inserts the bone needle into each of their tear ducts so that blood will mix with their tears.
# Over the basin(s), the Sufferer weeps for every ancestor whom they have forgotten. The tears should all fall within the basin(s).
# The Sufferer speaks the Litany of Weeping, seals the Vessel, and waits for the reaction to complete.
# The solution of the Product and the Byproducts is harvested from the Vessel&#39;s excretion basin.

&gt; //When Nadox, at the end of his journey, saw ION, he wept as he never wept before. The tears formed a pool; and ION went down into the pool and bathed, and took a deep drink of the salty liquor, and remembered himself; and this was the end of the first Ordeal. When the weeping stopped and Nadox beheld the man before him, he did what he had never done before: he smiled.//
&gt; **//Sone Valosh//, Chapter 17 (apocryphal)**[[footnote]] From the Commentaries of Karcist Karvas, 1989: &#34;So little is known about the //Ozi̮rmok//&#39;s Ordeals, and so much of what is known is apocryphal or incomplete. While many before me, including my esteemed predecessor Sulkist, have rejected Valosh as the former, a heretical text written as the Deathless Empire was collapsing, I believe it to be a true, or at least mostly truthful, interpretation of the life and Ordeals of Ion. The first step on the path to apotheosis is to remember who you are.&#34; [[/footnote]]
[[/=]]

**Name:** &#34;Sulkist&#39;s Sieve&#34;

**Origin:** Adytum&#39;s Wake (adapted by Karcist Sulkist from the similar but less-efficient Ritual Process SOL-14, &#34;Szabo&#39;s Sieve&#34;)

**Material Requirements:**
* A bearer of the White Worm with functioning tear ducts (the Celebrant)
* One liter of the solution produced by Ritual Process SOL-12 (the Solution)
* A vessel made of a non-reactive metal (the Chalice)
* One canister of Product AA-CHE-0271, &#34;Tac-Lac&#34;, or other military-grade lachrymator agent
* A disciple of the Old Blood with training in dictation, fluent in all languages spoken by the Celebrant (the Assistant)

**Products:**
* The Sacred Tears of Nadox the Wise

**Byproducts:**
* A possibly prophetic trance in the Celebrant

**Procedure:**
# The Assistant pours the Solution into the Chalice and places it before the Celebrant.
# The Celebrant drinks the solution, rinsing the Chalice with water to ensure every drop is imbibed.
# The Assistant records everything said by the Celebrant during their trance, and collects all Tears shed by the Celebrant in the Vessel.
# When the Celebrant has not spoken for over one minute, the Assistant sprays them with the lachrymator agent, and again collects all Tears shed by the Celebrant in the Vessel.
# After the trance has passed, the Celebrant is treated for the effects of the lachrymator agent.

&gt; //ION said to Lovataar, &#34;Let your loins be fruitful. Bear children, monsters, cancers and plagues. All that comes from your flesh is sacred, for it contains the knowledge of my words and deeds. Only if your line is scoured from the earth, each scrap of bone and sinew burned, each insect that has bitten you destroyed utterly, will that knowledge be lost. The blood cannot forget; it can only learn.&#34;//

&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** New Kin and Old
&gt; 
&gt; Cousin,
&gt; 
&gt; I hope this new year finds you well. We welcomed a new grandchild into our family this week—Aurélia and Filip&#39;s daughter. She was named Zsuzsana, and in the old tongue Kerulya, after our grandmother. Her blood is strong and pure, like her namesake. I daresay that if she shows a talent for the art of Lihakut&#39;ak, she may be Karcist some day, if Great-Uncle Szandor ever retires.
&gt; 
&gt; In less fortunate news, the search for the wisdom of our honored ancestor, Karcist Kezsdet, has hit dead end after dead end. I fear that the secret knowledge of the last of the Solomonari was burned with him by the accursed Turks. But I believe that we may still have a chance to recover that knowledge: after all, did Ion not say &#34;the blood cannot forget; it can only learn&#34;? We have the blood of Kezsdet in our veins, so we only need to remember.
&gt; 
&gt; There is, I will admit, an ulterior motive for this message. I wish to commission a product from your corporation. I want to unlock the secret mysteries in our blood, to recover the wisdom of not only Kezsdet but all our other fallen forefathers—and, if I am not being too bold, of Ion himself. I can, of course, pay handsomely; and I can suggest a place to start, with the Rite of Blessed Weeping and the Tears of Nadox.
&gt; 
&gt; Yours in blood,
&gt; Janós

&gt; **Trial PP-NEU-0127-005**
&gt; **Date(s):** 05.08.2017 - 26.08.2017
&gt; **Supervisor(s):** Nestor Gavras (GAVNES-PP-0161)
&gt; **Subject(s):** Volunteers of impure blood, ages 22-30, divided into three groups of 12 subjects each.
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedure:** Trial took place over the course of three weeks. Group A was given one drop of saline solution in each eye once daily. Group B was given one drop of standard solution in each eye once daily. Group C was given two drops in each eye and two sprays in each nostril of standard solution daily.
&gt; 
&gt; **Results:** Group A reported no unusual results.
&gt; 
&gt; After five days, members of Group B reported unusually vivid dreams. These dreams were internally consistent, and subjects knew that, in the dreams, they were experiencing events from the lives of their parents or grandparents[[footnote]] With one exception: subject B-7 reported dreams in which she was her father&#39;s brother. After the conclusion of the trial, the subject confronted her mother, who confirmed that she had been having an affair with the individual in question immediately prior to her pregnancy. [[/footnote]]. All dreams took place before the birth of the subject, although dreams in which the subjects experienced their grandparents&#39; lives did not necessarily take place before their parents&#39; births. Dreams continued for the duration of the study, increasing in duration and length. All dreams were later confirmed as accurate representations of events from the lives of subjects&#39; parents and grandparents.
&gt; 
&gt; After two days, members of Group C reported unusually vivid dreams. Dreams began as events from the lives of subjects&#39; parents and grandparents, but moved back to earlier generations as the study progressed. After ten days, subjects began to remember the skills and knowledge of their ancestors. Three subjects demonstrated knowledge of languages that one or more of their immediate ancestors (within three generations) were fluent in[[footnote]] C-3: Swedish; C-6: Hebrew and Yiddish; C-11: Latin. [[/footnote]], which they could not understand prior to the study; ten subjects[[footnote]] All subjects except C-4 and C-11 [[/footnote]] demonstrated knowledge of cooking and/or handicrafts consistent with their parents and/or grandparents; subjects C-4 and C-7 demonstrated knowledge of advanced mathematics consistent with a grandparent&#39;s education, with no previous mathematical experience.

&gt; **Trial PP-NEU-0127-007**
&gt; **Date(s):** 17.08.2017 - 17.09.2017
&gt; **Supervisor(s):** Nestor Gavras (GAVNES-PP-0161)
&gt; **Subject(s):** Volunteers of impure blood, ages 19-27, divided into four groups of 3 subjects each.
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedure:** Group A was administered 50cc of saline solution via intrathecal injection. Group B was administered 50cc of standard solution via intrathecal injection. Group C was administered 100cc of standard solution via intrathecal injection. Group D was administered 150cc of standard solution via intrathecal injection. All groups were monitored for one month.
&gt; 
&gt; **Results:** Group A reported no unusual results.
&gt; 
&gt; Members of Group B experienced significant cognitive abnormalities, beginning approximately 12 hours after injection. All members of Group B reported replacement of long-term memories with analogous events in the lives of ancestors (up to three generations removed). Subject B-1 experienced significant bodily dysmorphia linked to memories of his great-grandfather&#39;s loss of both legs in the First World War. Subject B-2 manifested thaumatological abilities; the source of these abilities is unknown, although is hypothesized to be subject&#39;s maternal grandmother. Subject B-3 manifested symptoms of major depressive disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, consistent with family medical history. All subjects experienced significant gender dysphoria[[footnote]] At the time, subjects B-1 and B-3 identified as female, and subject B-2 as male. All subjects were cisgender. [[/footnote]].
&gt; 
&gt; Members of Group C experienced progressive memory and personality replacement over the next several days. All members of Group C had their personalities completely replaced with an individual (deceased) ancestor. Subject C-1 had the memories and personality of her mother, up until the subject&#39;s birth. Subject C-2 had the memories and personality of his paternal grandmother, up until her death several years before the subject&#39;s birth. Subject C-3 had the memories and personality of his paternal grandfather, up until the subject&#39;s birth. Subjects C-1 and C-3 reported initial disorientation and then mild dysmorphia due to differences in body type and facial appearance; subject C-2 reported significant bodily dysmorphia and gender dysphoria, and also exhibited symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, presumably resulting from her memories of her own death.
&gt; 
&gt; All members of Group D expired from generalized tonic-clonic seizure within one hour of injection.
&gt; 
&gt; **Addendum, 22.02.2018:** Subjects were contacted after six months and interviewed. Subjects from group A reported no unusual side-effects.
&gt; 
&gt; Subjects from Group B experienced a number of lingering psychological effects, and had taken steps to address those issues. Subject B-1 identified as a transgender man, and was undergoing hormone replacement therapy; at the subject&#39;s request, both legs were amputated. Subject B-1 refused the organic prostheses offered (Product SB-AUG-0060), preferring mechanical prostheses. Subject B-2 identified as non-binary, and had significantly modified their body by means of thaumatological ritual; subject was offered a position with Group member Trismegistus Thaumotronics, and accepted (see Employee File LIUKIM-TT-0241). Subject B-3 was a patient at a mental hospital in Dusseldorf, Germany; the subject had been diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder, with two secondary personalities that corresponded to their mother and paternal grandfather.
&gt; 
&gt; The ancestral personalities of subjects from Group C remained stable. Subject C-1 had found employment as a secretary, and was in a romantic relationship with a man who bore a strong resemblance to the subject&#39;s father (i.e. the ancestral personality&#39;s husband). Subject C-2 was undergoing hormone replacement therapy and expressed interest in breast augmentation, facial feminization and sex reassignment surgeries, although did not identify as a transgender woman. Subject C-3 had enlisted in the Russian army[[footnote]]Subject&#39;s paternal grandfather, the source of the ancestral personality, was a veteran of the Soviet Army and fought in the Second World War.[[/footnote]] and at the time of interview was stationed in the Crimean Peninsula; the subject expressed dissatisfaction at the lack of &#34;a real war to fight&#34;, and intended to seek employment as a private mercenary after his term of service.

&gt; **Trial PP-NEU-0127-012**
&gt; **Date(s):** 07.01.2018 - 30.01.2018
&gt; **Supervisor(s):** Nestor Gavras (GAVNES-PP-0161), György Vörös (VORGYO-PP-0042)
&gt; **Subject(s):** One volunteer of pure blood, a direct descendant of Karcist Keszedet
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedure:** Subject is to be administered 100cc of standard solution via intrathecal injection. After one week to allow stabilization of the ancestral personality, this procedure is to be repeated, for a total of four weeks.
&gt; 
&gt; **Result:** Trial suspended after the third week, when the personality of Karcist Keszedet emerged. The Karcist retained all of his memories and arts, although he required some time in deep meditation to cultivate his body and his Akuloth before he was able to demonstrate his full knowledge of fleshcraft. Following a period of several months during which the Karcist adjusted to the modern world, he joined the Abraxas Group as a consultant-at-large, and is currently working with the Samael Biotechnology research and development division.

&gt; //I will never return. This is not prophecy, not promise, not guesswork. I simply know. I know I will never return, because I could never leave.//
&gt; **Third Oration to the Defenders, Verse 7**[[footnote]] From the Commentaries of Karcist Vataarin, 2013: &#34;There are two main interpretations of Ion&#39;s last public proclamation, made on the eve of the fall of Adytum. The first, originally articulated by Karcist Szovegzat, the father of Nälkä exegesis, proposes that Ion was truly immortal; it is supported by stories of Ion or someone much like him traveling to the [[[SCP-2478|Far East]]] and the Americas, spreading his teachings and his magic to the inhabitants. The second, proposed by Völutaar Gogolesk, Szovegat&#39;s blind scribe, suggests that Ion was referring instead to his teachings, which would always be with the children of the Old Blood even if Ion himself could not.&#34; [[/footnote]]
[[/=]]

&gt; **Research Proposal PP-NEU-0127-043**
&gt; **Proposed By:** György Vörös (VORGYO-PP-0042)
&gt; **Subjects Required:** Volunteers of the purest possible blood
&gt; 
&gt; **Purpose:** To resurrect Lord Ion and/or his consort Lovataar via repeated generational regression.
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedure:** Subject is to be administered 100cc of standard PP-NEU-0127 solution via intrathecal injection. When the ancestral personality has stabilized, its identity and pedigree will be established; if the ancestor in question is also of pure blood, the procedure is to be repeated. With an estimated 150 generations between us and the fall of the Deathless Empire, and an average of three generations of regression per dose, approximately 50 weekly injections should regress the subject to the time of Ion. If volunteers are drawn from bloodlines with little to no impurity (see attached files for promising candidates), it is likely that we will be able to resurrect Lord Ion and/or Klavigar Lovataar with only a handful of subjects.
&gt; 
&gt; **Status:** Approved 17.04.2018 by Alexander Croÿ (CROALE-AA-0001). Subject acquisition ongoing. Estimated start date: 01.12.2019
