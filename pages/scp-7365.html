+ Day 1
----
[8:00AM] Wake up.

[8:10AM] Get yourself ready for the day. Make sure to eat, you know how airline food is!

[8:30AM] Make sure you have everything packed, then order a taxi! It should be 30 minutes before it arrives!

[9:00AM] It&#39;s here! Tell them to go to the nearest airport!

[9:45AM] The ride is boring, but what can you expect!

[10:10AM] And now you&#39;re here! Go straight to the airfield!

[10:25AM] You&#39;ll find our plane sitting there waiting for you! It&#39;s that one! You know which one!

[10:30AM] A flight attendant will now welcome you in! It&#39;s 15 minutes before takeoff, so get comfortable!

[10:31AM] You&#39;ll shuffle around a bit, but there isn&#39;t a way to sit comfortably in your seat!

[10:34AM] You fail to get the attendant&#39;s attention when they walk by!

[10:37AM] You&#39;re getting hungry now, but it&#39;s your fault you didn&#39;t eat when I told you to!

[10:41AM] Ask for something to eat!

[10:42AM] They have nothing for you. You know how airline food is!

[10:44AM] Buckle up!

[10:45AM] The plane&#39;s rolling onto the tar-mac now!

[10:47AM] It&#39;s accelerating!

[10:47AM] Feel your arms and back and everything as it pushes into your seat! Isn&#39;t it wonderful!

[10:47AM] Your heart is beating so fast!

[10:47AM] Your stomach drops! That&#39;s how you know you&#39;re in the air!

[10:47AM] Look at the window! You cannot see the ground! Why is it so far away!

[10:47AM] Grasp desperately at the armrests! Strain every muscle! Close your eyes!

[10:47AM] There is nothing here! There is no world! You are no longer grounded! You are in the air!

[10:48AM] Something touched your shoulder!

[10:48AM] It&#39;s the flight attendant!

[10:48AM] They&#39;re talking!

[10:48AM] Tune in.

&#34;For thousands of years, Human beings walked the earth.&#34;

&#34;We felt the ground on our feet, we dug through the mud, ate from the soil, and it enriched us.&#34;

&#34;We became numerous. We had time to act past necessity, act past reason, past thought, to dream of a world where the sky was the soil for us to walk on.&#34;

&#34;But we fear change. We are built not to measure speed, but to sense changes in it. The gut feeling, that clenching pain. Inertia, always lingering.&#34;

&#34;Did we leave something behind in the mud? Did something linger when we took off to face our flight of fancies and ether high?&#34;

&#34;So high, now... So high.&#34;

&#34;We dig in the land of dreams, and we let it enrich us, but there is no satisfaction in the clouds.&#34;

&#34;Now and only, once we prance between the wisps of heaven, softly lingering at speeds past recognition, never before reached, we find, that dreams are just a stepping stone...&#34;

&#34;and we are left, always, digging in the mud...&#34;

&#34;Dreaming of the mud.&#34;

&#34;Lowering ourselves into the mud.&#34;

&#34;Suffocating in the mud.&#34;

&#34;Up to our chests in stones and dust.&#34;

&#34;Our metal bodies, extending out, resisting the stepping stone dream.&#34;

&#34;Until we land, like a bullet.&#34;

&#34;There is no light here.&#34;

&#34;There is no dream, but there does not have to be...&#34;

&#34;Feel it squishing, hear the warping sound, hear the glass break, feel your bones fracture, feel it crunch, feel the stone, feel the dust in your lungs, feel your heart quicken, your hot breath in the tiny space, the dream closing in, the mud, the dark side of the moon, the stone, somebody&#39;s face, your heart, your breath, the stone.&#34;

&#34;We are diamonds and coal, fueling the future.&#34;

&#34;Breathe in the air.&#34;

&#34;And let it all out.&#34;

&#34;Tomorrow will be a better day.&#34;
