The end of the Sixth Occult War marks the start of the modern era of normalcy, as the Veil is adopted as a formal policy and new organizations and agencies emerge to challenge the longstanding occult orders and cabals. This era is dominated by the Paranormal Renaissance, with the scientific method being applied against the mystical for the first time. Parahuman populations expand and anomalous phenomena proliferate, adding further fuel to the fires of the new parasciences. This period ends abruptly and violently with the outbreak of the Seventh Occult War.

In the aftermath of the Seventh Occult War, a new global consensus on normalcy emerges, even while international tensions reach new heights amid the Cold War. Both create a demand for new and better paratech, leading to a parascience bubble that will last for half-a-century. Normalcy organizations and paranormal agencies reach the zenith of their power, giving rise to a strong Veil and the so-called &#34;Golden Age of Normalcy&#34;.

The fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War causes the paratech bubble to burst, sending shockwaves through the Veiled world. An anomalous black market begins to emerge as old Soviet paratech stocks are lost and looted. The decline and eventual dissolution of Prometheus Labs in 1998 only serves to further destabilize the already reeling paranormal economy. Without the Cold War to justify their budgets, national paranormal agencies are downsized just as new mass communications technologies emerge, putting the integrity of the Veil in question for the first time in decades. And hanging over it all is the looming threat of another occult war...
