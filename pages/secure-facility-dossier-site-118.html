All personnel staying at Site-118 are to familiarize themselves with the Site&#39;s various Eshu protocols. Before doing so personnel are not allowed to discuss the Delta Wing, its contents, or the weaponry on-Site. The most important protocols are as follows:
[[div class=&#34;inline-colmod&#34;]]

++ General Information

**Purpose:** Site-118 serves as a containment facility designed to reduce the impact of any potential Keter-Class breach both through its remote location and its complex internal design. Other anomalies are often repurposed to ensure mutual containment. The Site has taken a focus on containing nomenclative hazards (Eshu-class) and Blackbox anomalies.[[footnote]]Anomalies with their location unlisted mostly for security reasons, distributed among all Facilities that fulfil the requirements of a Blackbox-Site.[[/footnote]] Site-118 also houses the Department of Phobology and Project HODDM√çMIS.

**Founded:** 1914-03-21

**Location:** Sonoran Desert, United States of America

**Founding Director:** Amanda Stewart

**Cover Story:** A copper mine that is implied to barely sustain itself. Partly used to test out new mining equipment.

Site-118 was the result of the __hitton__[[footnote]]SCP-6692 necessitates the replacement of all words including &#34;miss&#34; with an equivalent using &#34;hit&#34;.[[/footnote]] to secure and contain an anomaly, codenamed LABYRINTH.[[footnote]]SCP-Designation is currently unlisted.[[/footnote]] The anomaly was of special interest to the Foundation because it was composed largely of beryllium bronze and animate [[[SCP-359|hephaesium]]].[[footnote]]An alloy that can be used to animate objects and structures.[[/footnote]] Because of LABYRINTH&#39;s ability to teleport, Captain Stewart and her team had to chase it from Greece to its current location, a mountain in the Sonoran Desert. It is unknown if the anomaly &#34;crashed&#34; in the mountain because the mountains have higher than average Hume values, or because a specific entity within LABYRINTH was injured just prior to the teleportation attempt.

The anomaly was quartered, all remaining entities were contained, and Site-118 was established in LABYRINTH&#39;s remains.

Before the establishment and widespread usage of ontokinetic technology, Site-118 served as the primary site for the containment of reality-bending anomalies. The natural high Hume environment of the mountain the Site is set in coincides with the volume of beryllium bronze that was part of LABYRINTH. This results in an extremely effective field of reality stabilization. This includes local changes to reality, like the installed teleporters to ease transportation across the Site&#39;s 24 floors or the Pseudo-Riemannian manifolds later integrated to keep LABYRINTH quartered. After Scranton Reality Anchors were invented, the Site&#39;s beryllium bronze deposit was mined in large parts and transported for use in other Sites.

The labyrinthian structure of the Site has kept most of its occurring containment breaches internal. Many likely-to-breach anomalies are contained here as the Site layout disorients most anomalies before they can make any significant damage. As LABYRINTH remains semi-active, parts of its structure will shift sporadically; due to this, personnel have to routinely memorize the layout of their designated section under Protocol Ariadne. Site-118 is often used for the training of mobile task forces focused on navigation during containment breaches or extradimensional spaces.

Every floor on Site-118 is in theory self-sufficient as traversing floors without the usage of the installed elevators and teleporters can take one month on average. Project HODDM√çMIS was started to prepare for the worst case of being effectively trapped on a floor. This project is focused on making Foundation facilities double as long-term __shelters__[[footnote]]Using the word bunker transforms what it describes into a room filled exclusively with bunks and beds.[[/footnote]] during K-class scenarios. The Site has a small biological section that has its main focus on this project.

As the research section of Site-118 is relatively small, the Site is mostly dependent on other facilities to install newer technologies. For example, the Site does not have its own [[[aiad-homescreen|Artificially Intelligent Conscript]]] as has become commonplace across facilities. It instead relies on the general Foundation network, if a task requires an AIC.

Site-118 sits at a crossroad between tried and true Containment Methods and more modern and radical approaches to Containment, like the ones employed by [[[the-signing-of-the-las-vegas-accords| Vegas Sites]]]. The large amount of Keter-Class anomalies on the Site necessitates a containment approach dipping into the abnormal. Even the original __hitton__ to contain LABYRINTH would not have been possible without the anomalous contributions of the one Thaumaturge in the team.

All anomalies on Site are placed according to the principle that they would likely have to go through another anomaly&#39;s sphere of influence first. Anomalies are selected based on interactions that are likely to prevent the other anomaly from breaching. Essentially, Site-118&#39;s Containment Plan intends most of its anomalies to work as Hiemal or Thaumiel-Class systems.

Starting with LABYRINTH itself, each anomaly added to Site-118&#39;s collection streamlined the capture and containment of further anomalies, making the Site able to process Keter-Class anomalies, both listed and unlisted, in numbers well over the suggested amount.

Following the discovery of **##green|the breaching woods##** and the Foundation acquiring Procedure 4000-Halloway, Site-118 was chosen to coordinate expeditions into **##green|the destination of our yearly visits##**. For a time, most of these expeditions started at the Site&#39;s Main Interior Fireplace, designated 4000-MIF. However, Procedure 4000-Halloway was performed often enough in 4000-MIF that the borders between the Site and **##green|the realm that grasps from beyond the fireplace##** started to weaken, resulting in multiple incidents. Site-118 has since lost its coordination privileges and 4000-MIF is not used anymore. No new Main Interior Fireplace for performing Procedure 4000-Halloway has since been designated.

Together with [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-120|Site-120]]], Site-118 has been investigating the &#34;[[[cycle-of-seasons-hub|Cycle of Seasons]]],&#34; an ontological legal system stretching back to the days of the Fae Empire. While Site-120 focuses mostly on finding old records about the Cycle, Site-118 has been ##d86018|{{interacting with [[[SCP-6401]]], the forest of the Autumn Court. Significant leaps have been made in figuring out the nuances of the legal system and using it towards the Foundation&#39;s ends.}}##

Site-118 has been repeatedly the subject of internal sabotage and attacks by hostile GoIs, most often GoI-120 (&#34;Triumvirat√©&#34;). As their goal is most often to free other members from their group that are contained on-Site, these plans often succumb to the layout of the Delta Wing. GoI-120 remains increasingly successful in disrupting the Site&#39;s activities.

[[[SCP-5404|&#34;Boom-boom letter clusters&#34;]]] is maybe other attack from group or not. Boom-boom letter clusters made problems in house, but is over now with boom-boom letter clusters kept-in. Already there boom-boom letter clusters are stay in place. Time-that-is-after-now style problems in house maybe there from boom-boom letter clusters.

The nomenclative makeup of Site-118 has been severely disrupted by multiple anomalies. To counteract this a --bi--weekly day where communication using words is disallowed was introduced to the Site.

Apart from the ground level Site-118 comprises a total of 24 floors. Since LABYRINTH was quartered using Pseudo-Riemannian Manifolds the Site has been divided into the Beta, Gamma and Delta Wings with 6 floors each. The Wings function as their own mini-Sites, each controlled by a different Department Head. Before the quartering, each floor was connected to the next. Inside a Wing not all floors are next to each other, necessitating the implementation of elevators and teleporters to connect each Wing&#39;s floors. The Wings are only connected at __Tutorial Level__[[footnote]]Referring to the 0th level as Tutorial Level has resulted in 95% of all combat on the floor to be off a difficulty manageable by a newly appointed MTF agent.[[/footnote]] where they all come together.

[[=]]
+++ __Tutorial Level__
[[/=]]

__Tutorial Level__ serves first and foremost for repelling and delaying attacks on the Site. While it is on ground level, the floor is still located inside the mountain apart from the main gate and a watchtower.

The floor is otherwise used as a coordination point for the Wings of the Site. The teleporters to all other floors are contained here. All teleporters can be deactivated from both sides and need to be activated on both sides to function again. This way the risk of them falling into the wrong hands is negated.

In the worst case, the Pseudo-Riemannian manifolds can be deactivated, collapsing all Wings into one again and destroying the elevators in the process. Traversal from the highest to the lowest level would then take [[[the-adventures-of-siggy-and-robomonkey-hub|two to six years]]].

__Tutorial Level__ also houses various Conference rooms for meetings with guests or for Cross-Wing coordination. The living quarters on this floor are used semi-regularly.

[[=]]
+++ Beta Wing
[[/=]]

The Beta Wing is comprised of the floors with the largest concentration of beryllium bronze on the Site, which makes it the Wing with the most stable reality. The Head of the Department of Counter-Ontokinetics is automatically appointed as the Head of the Beta Wing.

Internal Levels of the Beta Wing:
# Main living quarters of the Beta Wing. Armed with Counter-Ontokinetic technology in case one of the lower level breaches.
# Safe and Euclid-class anomalous object storage. Chambers and lockers for objects that might easily disrupt a breaching Reality Bender can be automatically opened when they detect strong reality fluctuations.
# The floor mainly consists of the Beta Wing backup of the Sites database and a library filled with non-anomalous literature. Reality is more stable here than in normal libraries, so spontaneous changes in literature can take longer to manifest. The floor includes a small biological sector with enough resources to make it usable for Project HODDM√çMIS.
# The beryllium bronze amount on this floor is high enough to make reality hyper-stable. Except for research and MTF training __hittons__, the floor is rarely used. Some of the anomalies the Foundation contains in cryostasis are placed here.
# Reality Bender containment. A __bomb__[[footnote]]Using the word warhead transforms what it is used for into an alive head of a random general.[[/footnote]] is positioned at the transition to the 4th floor that would completely destroy the 5th floor and parts of the 4th and 6th floor when ignited.
# The floor consists entirely of the containment chamber of [[[SCP-3999]]].

[[=]]
+++ Gamma Wing
[[/=]]

The Gamma Wing houses the largest amount of personnel and is more research-focused than the other Wings. The Head of the Department of Phobology is automatically appointed as the Head of the Gamma Wing.


Internal Levels of the Gamma Wing:
# Main living quarters of the Gamma Wing and the main hub for day-to-day life across the facility. All sections near the second floor have been evacuated.
# The floor was originally used for MTF exercises and otherwise consisted of backup living quarters. After a malfunctioning of an On-Site __bomb__, 70% of the floor has been engulfed in a slowly advancing explosion. ##d86018|{{After it was clear that the malfunction could not be stopped the Autumn Court was asked to judge whether or not the explosion should finish, as an ongoing explosion would fall under Autumn&#39;s domain. The Court reasoned that they could not judge the future explosion that had not happened yet unless they could trade it for another future. [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6500/offset/5 Dr. Logan Arceo] volunteered her future to the Court and a trial for the state of the explosion was started. The Foundation has prolonged this trial every autumn, resulting in the current state of the explosion.}}##
# Original location for the facilities library and main data storage. After a [[[only-game-in-town-hub|fear-related phenomenon]]] was found that changed the literature, the library was relocated to the Beta Wing. The data storage serves as an unreliable backup. The floor is slowly being repurposed to contain humanoid anomalies repositioned from the Delta Wing.
# Before the Foundation took over, this floor supplied the few other lifeforms in LABYRINTH with resources. The floor continues to be used for this purpose for Site-118. Parts of the floor not used for resource creation are instead used for biological containment and cultivation. The floor serves as the focal point of Project HODDM√çMIS.
# The bulk of phobic entities and phobic-adjacent anomalies are contained here. Most of the floor is dedicated to the research of Phobology.
# An extremely labyrinthine floor. At first, solely used as an extension of the Containment Procedures of SCP-2006, which is located on this level. Now the labyrinthine structure serves additionally as a deterrent for [[[SCP-106|SCP-‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà]]].

[[=]]
+++ Delta Wing
[[/=]]

The Delta Wing used to be simply focused on medium-risk containment, but has since completely shifted to focus on the Fae. The Head of the Department of Nomenclature is automatically appointed as the Head of the Delta Wing.

Internal Levels of the Delta Wing:
# The main living quarters of the Delta Wing. Due to the constant nomenclative threat in the Wing it is the least used among the three first floors. Most research by the Department of Nomenclature is held here.
# This floor was originally used to store medium-risk and Euclid-class anomalous objects, but has since expanded to include objects originally on the 6th floor. Part of the floor serves as ##d86018|{{an entrance to SCP-6401. While the Autumn Court was originally only located on the 4th floor when it manifested on the Site, the containment of a borrowed item from SCP-6401 legally allowed the Court to extend its domain to the specific containment locker on this floor, as what was in truth borrowed was not the object but a small part of SCP-6401. Like all parts of the Site subsumed by SCP-6401, this part of the floor has transformed into a mix of an autumnal forest and Site-118&#39;s rooms and halls.}}##
# ##d86018|{{ The fourth floor tended to the non-biological needs of the Site, like sewage and the generating of electricity. The floor also includes the Site&#39;s main database servers, which could not be evacuated yet. The floor still consistently fulfils its purpose, despite SCP-6401 not existing outside of autumn. The amount of electricity has been reduced permanently, necessitating the constant usage of the Beta and Gamma Wings backup generators. The floor was subsumed by SCP-6401 during the takeover of parts of the second floor. The Autumn Court argued that SCP-6401 must remain as one realm. The legality of this is still being debated with the Court.}}##
# ##d86018|{{Former floor that was used by the Department of Nomenclature and a small division of the Department of Miscommunications. Most archives about the Sites Fae knowledge and the legal system of SCP-6401 are located here. During one of the visits to SCP-6401 a researcher remarked how they wished the way from Site-118 to the forest of SCP-6401 should be shorter. The Court chose to grant this wish, thinking it reasonable. SCP-6401 has manifested closer to the Site each Autumn until it manifested on this floor. When asked why this floor was chosen for manifestation it was answered that &#39;the Court was already here&#39; referring to documentation of its legal system.}}##
# ##d86018|{{SCP-6401 only sporadically manifests in some cells of the 5th floor. Most likely of prisoners, it lays claim to. That the Autumn Court has not tried to completely subjugate this floor is assumed to be caused by the presence of SCP-5925.}}## The floor was originally used for containing most humanoid anomalies on the Site. However, the state of the Delta Wing and the influx of GoI-120 attackers has resulted in most anomalies contained on the floor being of Fae nature. //##blue|SCP-5925 is a notable exception to this and is planned to be relocated to the Gamma Wing as soon as a suitable cell for its needs is found##//.
# The floor originally contained high-risk and Keter-class objects together with 4000-MIF. After the border between this reality and the **##green|world yearning for its brother court##** started to weaken the rest of the floor was abandoned.

**Description:** Officially a sub-Department of the larger Department of Ontokinetics, the Department of Counter-Ontokinetics focuses on containment, disruption and termination __hittons__ for Reality Benders and other reality-affecting phenomena. The Department prioritizes mundane tactics over those that make use of paratech or anomalous personnel, an approach that has fallen out of use with further advances in the field of ontokinetics.

The Department came out of the original crew that surveyed LABYRINTH and recognized the potential use case of the found beryllium bronze. The original project just focused on mining the bronze, which was discontinued to not risk destabilizing LABYRINTH.

**Description:** The Department studies fear in general and in association with the anomalous. It derives containment and engagement protocols for phobic entities and phenomena. The Department has its own associated MTF, Omicron-13 (&#34;Phobophobia&#34;).

The Department of Phobology has existed since the founding of Site-118. It is currently unknown why or by whom the department was founded as the first phobic entities were only contained years later.

++++ Department of Nomenclature
[[/=]]
-----
**Description:** This department focuses on name-affecting anomalies. It was a necessary addition to the Site after it became clear it would also focus on ##green|**those woodlands that forbid its naming**## and the Fae in general. Originally worked close together with other infohazard-focused departments like the Department of Miscommunication, but has found its own footing since.

Due to being heavily involved in all of them, the Department of Nomenclature remains a conceptual Ground Zero for the various infohazards that affect the Site. It only remains functional due to ##d86018|{{fulfilling part of its duties inside SCP-6401 which is more equipped to handle nomenclative anomalies}}##.

**‚Ññ of Members:** Between 64 and 111

**Leader:** Heads Shoulders Knees No Soul
##d86018|{{**Note:** During one trial inside SCP-6401, the Autumn Court needed to legally demand a member of the Foundation to name}}## {{##green|**the unnameable**##}} ##d86018|{{or lose the trial. The Foundation extracted the promise from the Court that the naming party would still be able to work. With the promise Department Head Heads Shoulders Knees No Soul breached Protocol 4000-Eshu. The Head is effectively dead but can still perform all required duties. To remain functional, Heads Shoulders Knees No Soul needs to undergo maintenance by the Autumn Court every year.}}##

++ Notable Event Logs
[[/=]]
-----

**1920-03-21** LABYRINTH is fully explored and the last resident anomalies of it are contained.

**1929-11-22** Site-118 enters lockdown mode and requests backup from all surrounding facilities.

**1929-11-24** Richard Langton is promoted to Site Director. The Department of Phobology and all its assets are transferred to the Gamma Wing.

**1930-02-14** [[[SCP-2006]]] is contained.

**1945-03-31** [[[SCP-2608]]] is introduced to Site-118 as part of the 2608 Advanced Warning System.[[footnote]]The population of SCP-2608 is sensitive to, and easily dies from, anomalous changes in its environment.[[/footnote]] 2608-AWS registers a Status of **##009f6b|LOW DISTURBANCE##**.

**1956-03-21**¬†¬†After enough successful exploration __hittons__ into **##green|the forest governed by then unknown rules##** 4000-MIF is established at Site-118.

**between time that is before and time that is after** [[[SCP-5404|&#34;Boom-boom letter clusters&#34;]]] make damage in house. Damage is not stop for time until help is found. Now boom-boom letter clusters and [[[they-had-names|boom-boom letter cluster makers]]] are kept-in except for when making old boom-boom letter clusters. But no new ones now.

**1960-06-20** [[[SCP-6692]]] is discovered. A connection to other nomenclative anomalies as well as a local nomenclative breakdown are both seen as possible co-reasons for its existence.

**1961-10-31** [[[tricks|Using SCP-2006 for a containment operation is successful.]]] Subsequently, [[[SCP-106|SCP-‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà]]] is permanently contained in Site-118.

**1961-12-06** SCP-6692 is officially reclassed as Thaumiel after being of consistent help to the Site.

**1979-07-16** [[[SCP-2599]]] gets transferred to another Site that is better suited to accommodate the anomaly.

**1980-09-23** ##d86018|{{The first invitation to [[[SCP-6401]]] is sent to Site-118.}}##

**1981-12-21** Phobologist Dr. Randall Owings discovers the corpse of the previous Site Director, who was thought to be on an off-Site __hitton__ and sending orders remotely. These orders turned out to originate from Director Langton&#39;s account but the [[[only-game-in-town-hub| author of these messages remains unclear]]]. Dr. Owings was subsequently promoted to Site Director.

**1984-06-06** [[[SCP-3192|SCP-‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà]]] is relocated to Site-118. Despite the tight security, information leaks could not fully be stopped and SCP-‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà is breached multiple times by Foundation personnel. All further incidents involving SCP-‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà have been expunged per its Special Containment Procedures.

**1987-04-10** [[[another-day-on-the-job|The former SCP-5389]]] breaches Containment and is able to flee as far as the 3rd Level of the Beta Wing before being neutralized. Two Agents were lost in the incident and multiple minor to medium reality alterations persist on the 3rd to 5th floor of the Beta Wing.

**1990-12-31** 2608-AWS registers a Status of **##ffd300|ELEVATED DISTURBANCE##**. All anomaly positions on-Site are evaluated and a few anomalies are transferred off-Site to elevate disturbance levels.

**1995-09-22** [[[SCP-5925]]] is originally discovered and contained. On the same day an //##blue|unrelated##// breach occurs in 4000-MIF. Expeditions into the **##green|woods evergrowing##** using 4000-MIF were reduced in frequency going forward.

**1998-08-26** Multiple personnel from Site-118 become addicted to [[[denton-and-mcdowell-recover-la-chupacabra-s-pinata-from-a-je| the demonoarcotic ‚ÄûAsh‚Äú]]]. The problem is later solved by the Alchemy Department stopping the demonoarcotic&#39;s production.

**2000-01-10:** A pipe supposed to be transporting [[[SCP-3227]]]-produced toxins was [[[in-fear| falsely installed, resulting in a toxin leak]]] and in 14 casualties.

**2003-06-13** [[[SCP-3999]]] and the corpse of Researcher James Talloran is discovered. A full investigation into the event has concluded and is available to Level 5 personnel. The many exploded Scranton Reality Anchors inside the chamber of SCP-3999 have resulted in reality becoming less stable on the 5th and 6th floor of the Beta Wing.

**1990-12-31** 2608-AWS registers a Status of **##red|CRITICALLY DISTURBED##**. No measures that would be able to lower disturbance levels are known.

**2004-01-01** The Site-118 WLAN intersects with **##green|the wooden ever-adapting network##** and now named entities discover the internet through it. As has been later rediscovered, an agreement was reached and [[[SCP-6471]]] was created under Project Webcage. Some details about the creation of the anomaly remain unknown. ##d86018|{{Update pending.}}##

**2004-09-22** Site-118 is hit by a blizzard that collapsed large parts of the Delta Wing and resulted in the //##blue|abduction##// of SCP-5925. ##d86018|{{SCP-6401-A demanded to be contained in hopes to make its designation settle more as its name.

++++ REPORT TO THE TEMPORAL ANOMALIES DEPARTMENT
[[/=]]

[[div style=&#34;margin-left: 10px;&#34;]]
This is the last Site-118 Dossier I reviewed of its countless iterations. Exactly how one qualifies for the Autumn Clearance still remains a mystery, and I&#39;m afraid it will remain so until we put an agent into the Site itself during the late 20th century.

I can determine that the origin of the various ends of Site-118 was caused in part by the main Keter anomalies contained on the 6th floor of each Wing, with SCP-2006 being the most common element. In some timelines, SCP-2006 is initially going through a [[[Tension and Release|learning phase]]] while in others [[[The Meaning of Fear|SCP-2006 has been aware of its circumstances from the beginning]]]. What [[[In Fear|initial incident]]] leads to SCP-2006 eventually breaching is likewise in flux.

There are of course plenty of scenarios where SCP-2006 is unrelated to [[[the-adventures-of-siggy-and-robomonkey-hub|the doom of the Site]]].

The only certain fact is that no version of Site-118 in which this &#34;Autumn Clearance&#34; appears, survives to the end of [[[SCP-6500|the Impasse]]].
