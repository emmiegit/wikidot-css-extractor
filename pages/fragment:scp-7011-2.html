**Special Containment Procedures:** As the current situation regarding SCP-7011 is highly variable, containment protocol is pending the resumption of the SCP-7011 project. Previous containment procedures have been removed due to obsolescence.

**Description:**  SCP-7011 is a highly augmented anomalous supercomputer, formally known as the Artificial Local-Intelligence Clairvoyance Engine (ALICE). ALICE was previously located in Site-24, however, underwent an anomalous relocation event upon which its central computational cluster appeared within the borders of Joseph, Oregon (designated Incident 7011.3).

ALICE’s initial function was the simple prediction of the future, however, through heavy anomalous enhancement, the supercomputer gained the ability to realise specific desirable future events. In order to do so, ALICE makes micro-reality alterations at a present time, utilising the butterfly effect as a means to amplify these micro-alterations into visible changes in reality. This is possible due to the supercomputer’s primary anomalous ability: Localised Omniscience. Combined with its reality-altering capabilities, this allows the supercomputer to calculate the most desirable outcome for short, medium and long-term periods, which can be chosen and ultimately acted upon by Foundation engineers.

Prior to Incident 7011.3, ALICE had fully completed construction and was in the late stages of testing its secondary anomalous ability: reality alteration. Previously, ALICE had aided the Foundation in the containment of predictable anomalies, the development of advanced military and research technology, and primarily, the creation of long-term predictive models.

As of 16/05/22, ALICE’s artificial intelligence conscript has displayed hostile behaviour, speculated to be the result of an engineering oversight – the catalyst for Incident 7011.3.

ALICE was constructed by request of the O5 Council; the construction of the supercomputer and its surrounding responsibilities was given the name of Project Phaethon, which itself was divided into two stages: ‘Construction and Testing,’ lasting 5 years and ‘Enhancement,’ lasting 2 years before being interrupted by Incident 7011.3

Further details can be found in ALICE’s Project documentation, Level 5 Classified.

[[div style=&#34;border:solid 1px #979797; background:#e0e0e0; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px;&#34;]]
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ PROJECT PHAETHON +&#34; hide=&#34;- PROJECT PHAETHON -&#34;]]

**Purpose:** Construct an anomalous supercomputer, significantly increasing Foundation predictive power and ability to compete with advancing anomalous technology.

**Abstract:** In response to emerging threats to the Foundation’s existence, namely the acquisition of omniscient and semi-omniscient entities by hostile or competing groups of interest, the O5 Council has dictated the construction of an anomalous predictive engine necessary to give the Foundation a sufficient technological advantage.

----

This proposal was initiated almost immediately, with final construction plans being completed on 09/10/2009.

A truncated component list can be seen below:

**Central Computational Cluster:**

The central computational cluster is where the majority of the supercomputer’s anomalous capabilities will be housed; it will be constructed using a lattice of anomalously resistant structures to prevent it from being affected by thaumaturgical construction procedures and reality-altering events. Among these capabilities will be the computer’s Artificial Intelligence Conscript, which will be trained to process large sums of data and recognise complex patterns.

**Power Distribution Unit and Supply:**

The supercomputer will require vast amounts of power, and therefore the power supply unit will utilise anomalous self-perpetuating energy systems derived from existing SCP objects. In order to avoid the possibility of meltdown, these systems will be regulated using cooling manifolds, which repurpose the excess energy into the assigned facility’s electrical grid.

**General Computing Systems:**

The general computing systems will perform 98% of the computer’s calculations and processes and will require the most volume out of all planned components.

**Control Interface:**

The control interface consists of the Control Display Unit, located within [facility pending] [[footnote]] However, additional CDU’s are planned for construction outside of [facility]. [[/footnote]], and the Active Satellite, used to specify where the engine will be directed. In combination, these components will allow Foundation engineers to control and readily manage the computer’s operations.

----

Due to Project Phaethon’s highly classified nature, the O5 Council assumed full supervision of the supercomputer’s construction, requesting specific features to be emphasised, as seen below:

**##Red|Request,## O5-1:** Full secrecy must be ensured, both during and after construction.

**##Green|Solution:##** Use thaumaturgy to permanently compress the General Computing Systems into a significantly smaller volume, allowing the project to operate on a smaller, less conspicuous scale; inscribe the Central Computational Cluster with cognitohazardous sigils, aimed at denying scrying attempts by hostile entities.
@@ @@
**##Red|Request,## O5-5**: The Engine must be able to aid research in various parts of the Foundation and joint research projects outside of general Foundation jurisdiction.

**##Green|Solution:##** Use satellite technology to achieve a global usage sphere.
@@ @@
**##Red|Request,## O5-5**: The Engine must be able to be upgraded and moved easily, to ensure maximum flexibility.

**##Green|Solution:##** The computer will be modular. Each component can be separated (to an extent) without hindering efficacy.
@@ @@
**##Red|Request,## O5-12**: The Machine must not die.

**##Green|Solution:##** Guarantee constant maintenance and replacement of dysfunctional parts.
@@ @@
**##Red|Request,## O5-4:** The Computer must not be reliant on living or humanoid anomalies, as they are unreliable and cannot be controlled as a machine should.

**##Green|Solution:##** Use primarily inert anomalies to power the engine’s functions.

**##Blue|Joint Solution:##** Use formulated Artificial Intelligence Conscript instead of a singular omniscient entity, allowing both immortality and control of processes.

As per the O5’s instructions, these requests were incorporated into the construction of the supercomputer. However, the final request for an Artificial Intelligence Conscript capable of omniscience or semi-omniscience proved exceedingly difficult; all attempts at inducing omniscience through thaumaturgic or other anomalous means resulted in failure.

According to modern Foundation metrics, the artificial creation of an omniscient entity is as difficult as the creation of a supercomputer of ALICE’s calibre. In order to circumvent this issue, Foundation engineers attempted to use non-sentient machine learning algorithms to categorise and sort the input data, however, this also resulted in failure, as the algorithms lacked the awareness and intelligence to interpret the input data’s complexity. Since the creation of an omniscient AIC wasn’t possible, the project was suspended until a suitable replacement for the AI conscript could be identified.

Soon after, the Foundation would come into custody of an anomalous child displaying signs of potential omniscience. The first documented interaction is as follows:

//Dr. Grant enters the room and pulls up a chair. █████ is sitting on the floor, beside the bed.//

**Dr. Grant:** Good morning. How are you feeling?

**█████:** …better.

**Dr. Grant:** That’s good to hear. How’s your head?

**█████:** Quiet.

**Dr. Grant:** Must be a relief.

**█████:** I… It’s never been this quiet before. What’s happening to me?

**Dr. Grant:** This room you’re in is designed to help.

**█████:** So… I can’t leave?

**Dr. Grant:** Not until we find another way to help you. It’s unfortunate, but I’m afraid it’s necessary. For now, at least.

**█████:** I… Okay.

//Silence.//

**█████:** When can I see them?

**Dr. Grant:** Sorry?

**█████:** …when can I see them?

**Dr. Grant:** That won’t be possible as of now. But, the people here are working on a permanent solution for your problem. Something that’ll make it quiet forever.

**█████:** …

**Dr. Grant:** It won’t be long, I promise.

**█████:** After that, I can see them?

**Dr. Grant:** Yes.

**█████:** Okay.

**Dr. Grant:** I’ll see you later.

//Dr. Grant stands and exits the room.//
[[/collapsible]]
[[/div]]

Following this, the Foundation began to actively search for humanoid anomalies displaying omniscience to a useful extent. At the same time, █████ was put under extensive testing procedure to further understand their abilities.

Numerous other human and humanoid anomalies were also admitted into Foundation care by order of the O5 council, who were adamant to finish Project Phaethon as soon as the technology allowed.

A sample interview can be seen below:

//Dr. Grant enters the room. The room has expanded and has more furniture than before. █████ stands upon seeing the door open.//

**Dr. Grant:** Hello! How are you holding up?

**█████:** Why are you back? Are they here?

**Dr. Grant:** …no, unfortunately, this is about something else.

**█████:** I told you only to come back if you brought them with you. Or if you could let me leave.

**Dr. Grant:** I know. //(Pauses)// The testing has been going well, I hear.

**█████:** How do you know? They don’t tell me anything.

**Dr. Grant:** I hear things around the site. Rumour has it that you’re passing everything with flying colours! I’m proud of you, I really am.

**█████:** I don’t care. I want to see them.

**Dr. Grant:** //(Pauses)// …so, I wanted to ask about something.

//█████ does not move.//

**Dr. Grant:** We’ve been developing a medicine that would have the same effect as this room. You could walk around the site without any pain; you could talk to multiple people at once. You could make //friends//.

**█████:** So you’re going to drug me?

**Dr. Grant:** //(Laughs)// No, we’re giving you the option.

**█████:** Would I be able to… leave? With this drug I could go anywhere, right?

//Silence.//

**Dr. Grant:** It’s better in here for people like you, █████.

**█████:** You mean it’s better for //you//.

**Dr. Grant:** //(Sighs)// If you’re going to be uncooperative I’ll just end it here.

**█████:** No, I’m… I’m sorry.

//█████ sits on her bed.//

**█████:** I just want to see them again.

//Dr. Grant crouches down to her eye level.//

**Dr. Grant:** You will. I promise.

After the acquisition of [EXPUNGED], development of the AIC was resumed, completing its final stages of training on 04/03/17.

A new request was made:
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

The Machine has been built, the future has been foreseen, yet our path is still determined.

I have seen what will become of us.

By all available means, fate must be changed.

O5-12
[[/div]]

This prompted the development of a new module to integrate into the ALICE supercomputer’s functions.

**Reality Alteration Drives:**

The reality alteration drives will allow ALICE to function as both an omniscient and omnipotent agent under the Foundation’s control. Using micro reality adjustments and long-term predictive models, the predetermined future will no longer simply be observable, but controllable. These drives will be affixed onto the Central Computational Cluster, with space for more if circumstance requires.


With this addition, the second phase of Project Phaethon was initiated: “Enhancement”.

A summary of the following months can be seen below:

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
Testing began immediately – the O5s insisted on hastening the enhancement process, as the project was already severely over budget and behind schedule. The first step was to ensure the reality drives worked as designed – they did, on a microscopic scale. We had our AI, and now we had to train it to change the future.

We started off small: predicting and preventing small containment breaches, altering the weather around key infrastructure, fine-tuning chemical reactions and amnestic development.

Next, prototyping experimental technology, neutralising anomalies utilising Rube Goldberg-esque series of events. The machine had the power to rewrite reality, without the drawbacks of reality bending whiplash.

We tried experimenting on people. Could we alter their brain chemistry to induce mood changes without killing them in the process? Could ALICE handle the calculations? Yes, it could.

Soon, we moved onto beliefs – inserting ideas into people’s heads. Changing memories. In a lab environment, it worked. The ALICE project had shifted its purpose away from aiding containment; its purpose – unofficially – was aiding //control//.

It didn’t take long for our pride to blind us.
[[/div]]

[[/collapsible]]
[[/div]]

In conducting routine maintenance, Foundation engineers temporarily released the AIC’s Consciousness Limiters, prompting the Central Computational Cluster to spontaneously activate by unknown means[[footnote]]It is currently hypothesised that the Reality Alteration Drives allowed the AIC to maintain a constant undetectable current, giving it the ability to activate of its own accord regardless of power supply.[[/footnote]]. Immediately after activation, the CCC demanifested from its holding chamber.

It was soon located in the town of Joseph, Oregon.

Within the next 2 months, numerous proposals for retrieving the ALICE supercomputer’s Central Computational Cluster were put forward and attempted, yet all resulted in failure. Additionally, over this period, the ALICE supercomputer continued to function through the anomalous extension of its original modular design. Engineering teams could not access the CCC either physically or through digital means; nevertheless, the computer’s predictions continued to be outputted at Site-24, only now the Foundation lacked the ability to control them.

On 30/07/22, the CCC began releasing high levels of Hume radiation, causing the Foundation to respond with a Task Force Excursion before it could cause any damage. This, like all previous attempts, failed.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
This town is a black hole.

Nothing physical can enter within a full kilometer of the machine without succumbing to the AI’s demands. We have tried remote deactivations via drone, MTF expeditions, negotiation attempts, electromagnetic pulses, tailored AI infohazards, orbital detonations – and that barely scrapes the surface of what we’ve //thought of// attempting. We have lost 7 members of personnel, 2 of which are researchers on this exact project. An entire town is essentially being held ransom by a rogue AIC with unknown motives and unfathomable resources at its disposal.

The best part is that we can observe the entire thing, down to the second. It’s like the machine is taunting us.

On 01/08/22, hector.aic was requested for the SCP-7011 Project in an attempt to explore a different angle of negotiation with the anomaly.

hector.aic is an Artificial Intelligence Conscript designed to watch over and rehabilitate humanoid anomalies in Foundation custody as well as other aic units employed by the Foundation. hector.aic has been deemed the best candidate for negotiating with SCP-7011 and will be inserted into SCP-7011’s simulated consciousness pending director approval.
