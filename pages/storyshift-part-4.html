&#39;ello spooky world!

Guess who is finally taking the leap and joining this amazing and scary site? Well, of course, it&#39;s me!

But now, who is this cheeky fucker speaking you may ask yourself? Glad you asked! Let me tell you more about moi.

I am your average - well, maybe not so average, horror documentary enthusiast, always staying up late at night to watch as many as I can because, honestly, the day is too short to watch them all! Besides, what better time to consume scary media than at night, am I right? The only side effect is that I barely get any sleep at all, but hey, who cares about eyebags?

My favorite weekend activity is, you guessed it, ghost hunting! I used to go with some mates of mine to abandoned locations to see if we could encounter a specter or anything else that was paranormal, with not much success really. Now it&#39;s just me and my good ole camera the ones on the hunt for ghosts, and of course, my reliable EMF detector.

&#34;But have you always been interested in the paranormal?&#34; you may ask. And the truth is, I haven&#39;t always been into ghosts and spooky stuff. Up until I was eight, I was a very scaredy-cat: afraid of the dark, afraid of strange noises at night, afraid of ghosts... and afraid of the shadow man I started seeing outside my house one night.

I don&#39;t know why it had to be my house, but it had been targeted by... a vaguely human-looking creature who kept wandering around with its glowing eyes looking for something. From the first time I saw it, I was absolutely terrified and couldn&#39;t hide and cry until I felt it was gone.

I always thought my parents wouldn&#39;t believe me or would lecture me about the shadow man not being real and treating me like a baby, so I just opted to can it and never say a thing about it... until my dad saw it.

He had noticed I was more scared than usual and wasn&#39;t sleeping well. I kept telling him and my mom I was having nightmares about a scary shadow - what else could it be? I thought, but one day my old man managed to take a good look at the creature before it ran and hid. And so, without missing a beat, he grabbed a shotgun - different times were those, and killed the figure in the act, promptly calling the police to come over.

What comes after is still unclear after all these years. According to the coppers, my dad had killed a serial killer who had taken several lives already and managed to avoid detection for almost four months. Sure, that was something unnerving but, I mean, there are a lot of serial killers in the public record, right? Well, there was... something else.

The police did some further research on the case and discovered there were certain... irregularities. The sightings of the killer, simply named &#34;Penumbra&#34; after its death, had happened in locations very far away from one another, making the timing of such sightings completely impossible had it been a single person, but the evidence pointing towards a group was weak and lacking.

The victims never spoke about what they saw for one reason or another, and that included me. There was never an answer as to how this person ever managed to make its eyes glow or to appear as a pitch-black shadow, as the corpse didn&#39;t have these properties, and no gadgets that could cause this effect were found. There were also very odd coincidences that allowed the murderer to eliminate its targets with no complications, and nobody ever witnessed the killings. Or should I say... kidnappings?

Here&#39;s another thing that happened around this mysterious figure: the bodies were all found in an abandoned factory several miles away from the victims&#39; houses. It wasn&#39;t clear if the killer murdered the victims on the spot, in the factory, or on the way there. Besides, all the bodies found in the lair showed no decomposition whatsoever and seemed to have been killed at the same time... which didn&#39;t make any sense because all victims went missing in the span of months.

The factory itself was very strange as well. Nobody remembered it being ever operative, and there were no marks that shed light on who had built it. It was in the middle of the woods, and it looked so old despite having fairly modern equipment in a terrible state. But that&#39;s all I can possibly tell you about the factory or the victims.

My father went to a police station to be processed, but he was let loose shortly after. Apparently, no case was necessary for some reason. The police never dared to reveal any photographic evidence about the case, and never really said anything publicly besides &#34;it&#39;s over&#34;. They privately talked about it with my dad; he says they didn&#39;t give him much details about the killer or the victims, and I don&#39;t think he would have wanted to know more about it. I barely managed to overhear some of the chat they had and I didn&#39;t really understand much about it at that age, but the words &#34;hanged upside down&#34;, &#34;missing 97 bones&#34; and &#34;their skin inside out&#34; have haunted me ever since.

And that, folks, is the moment I made up my mind. I decided to not fear the monsters that wanted to scare us, but instead face them and fight them off. Imagine if my dad hadn&#39;t taken action: I could and would have been the next victim. How many people have been harmed in the past because they were too scared to fight back, or just tell somebody about what haunted them, and fell paralyzed by their fears? Is that what I want for myself, and for others to experience?

So I say this: despite being one single individual, I stand ready to defend the ones I care about against all paranormal threats, whether they like it or not. And - I admit how cheesy and savior complex-ish my ideal sounds. Still, I am truly willing to investigate ways to face and overcome the bloodthirsty creatures that terrorize our neighborhoods.

Anywho! If you want some help to figure out how to keep your sleep paralysis demon at bay, don&#39;t hesitate to ask me! I&#39;ll tell you if I&#39;ve come up with something and link you to my post and if I haven&#39;t, we can brainstorm together! I am also interested in cryptids and ghosts as a whole, so I&#39;m always down for a little chit-chat about spooky creature sightings throughout history or my own experience, or even give you tips to make your first ghost hunt session a successful one!

Looking forward to know each one of you lovely spooky people!

I&#39;m very glad you&#39;ve joined this site but what the fuck. Have you tried going to therapy to deal with all this? Being almost a victim of a ritualistic serial killer can be something that hurts you for life.

I did go to therapy, along with my parents. We&#39;re all feeling way better now than back then, mostly because we&#39;ve had time to recover from that - for reference, I was 8 when that happened, and now I&#39;m 22. We also moved from Sandwich (yes that&#39;s the fucking name of my old town) to Braintree (im telling you these names are a fucking joke) and pretty much left that horrible story in the past.

&#39;ello spooky world!

This is my first //actual// post on the site, so I&#39;m sharing with you the basics on my &#34;research&#34; on spooky creatures and other things that are commonly posted and discussed here. So, without any further ado, let&#39;s get to it!

Despite most of our lives being calm and us only daydreaming about monsters and fiends, there&#39;s a non-zero chance that you may experience something supernatural first-hand; if that were to happen, you should be prepared or at least aware of what could you possibly be dealing with so you can live to tell the tale. Or, for this matter, post about it on Parawatch!

Paranormal threats can be grouped into four different categories:

* Artifacts
* Spirits
* Cryptids
* Phenomena

**__Artifacts__** are, well, what you would call &#34;cursed objects&#34;. Think of the Necronomicon, the Tomb of Tutankhamun, or The Hands Resist Him painting. Basically, any inanimate object tied to the paranormal falls into this category, and they&#39;re fairly simple to avoid. They&#39;re objects after all.

This probably applies to other forms of media that aren&#39;t necessarily objects, such as songs or poems, so Tomino&#39;s Hell and Gloomy Sunday could also be considered &#34;artifacts&#34; since, while not items, they need a physical medium to exist and therefore affect you.

Now, since most of these items are in mausoleums, abandoned houses, decrepit castles and such, it&#39;s very unlikely that you might encounter one of these; however, in case your eBay order is indeed haunted, here&#39;s a couple tips.

First of all, prevention. Please check any possible clues that may tell you somebody&#39;s trying to offer you a cursed artifact; essentially, you need to treat these people as if they were potential scammers, so if the item is too good to be this cheap, it may be haunted... or just a mundane scam - but it&#39;s best to not take risks!

This obviously doesn&#39;t mean you should be all the time checking for any traces of luciferase or diabolic acid in your milk and cereal, but you should be attentive when getting unlicensed or discontinued products from obscure pages online or when buying stuff from sketchy thrift shops.

And please, if you&#39;re not somebody who is used to working with paranormal items and see an online announcement about a bidding event on some cursed floating doll, don&#39;t try and get it. Sure, having a cursed object as a memento would be cracking but these things are not toys - even if you would argue they were designed to be.

&#34;But bluey, it is too late for that now! I bought a bowl from a mysterious coat man and now I get messages from my dead dad in my soup! What do I do?&#34;

Well, first of all, evaluate how bad is the situation. For example, it&#39;s not the same to have Chucky roaming your house than to have a funny potato that casts no reflection on mirrors. So, let&#39;s assess your situation.

What to do when you have an object that&#39;s cursed but requires you to activate itself? Well, just don&#39;t interact, and destroy it if possible. An evil TV show that forces you to watch it? Try to stop watching with all your might, wait until it&#39;s over if you can&#39;t resist it, then don&#39;t watch it again.

What about a retro game with unsettling stuff you definitely don&#39;t remember being there? Don&#39;t go any further, end your run there, dispose of the cartridge. What about a bell that makes you see ghosts if you ring it? Don&#39;t ring it, carefully leave it on a place where you can forget about it and continue with your life.

See the pattern there? Just don&#39;t do anything stupid and stay away. Well, that&#39;s quite general advice for any kind of paranormal situation. My point is that you don&#39;t want to expose yourself to cursed stuff. You may be a horror enthusiast like yours truly, but your safety must come first. Always. If you&#39;re willing to store these items, something I don&#39;t recommend, never do it alone. Try to get a crew first and the required equipment.

But there is more to it. What happens when the cursed object does stuff on its own? Well, my first advice would be to try to get rid of it or destroy it if it keeps coming back. Wrecking the artifacts tends to help greatly when you&#39;re dealing with their curses.

You might want to be careful tho, since sometimes objects that move on their own are products of spiritual possessions or similar incidents, in which case you may want to be careful because Spirits are a bit more complicated than that. And, speaking of which...

**__Spirits__** is a broad term that refers to any form of conscious entity that isn&#39;t physical or related to this realm, being mainly ghosts and demons. They are commonly esoteric in nature and rather than physically harming you, they are most likely to recur to psychological &#34;torture&#34; by, well, haunting you. Remember that this may vary depending on the type of spirit we&#39;re talking about.

Like I told you, spirits are quite complicated to handle, so my advice is simple: call an exorcist or somebody who knows how to deal with these situations. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much you can do against a ghost or a demon if you try and take the matter into your own hands.

Also, another very broad advice: don&#39;t try to do anything alone. Until the exorcist arrives, try to either leave the place or stay together with whoever you may be. This also applies to ghost hunting; search for spooks in groups and stay close at all times. When I go in the search for ghosts alone my plan is just to photograph one, not to try and interact with them. As soon as I get my picture or feel unsafe I retreat.

Spirits are, by the way, very hard to photograph. However, the type of entities that are easy to photograph are...

**__Cryptids__**, my favorite group of spooks. These muckers are actually the most chill of all categories, and that is because a cryptid, by definition, is a species whose existence hasn&#39;t been proven yet. So this can be the elusive Mothman or just a funny-looking seahorse no one has seen before. Speaking of the Mothman, I&#39;d like to talk about him sometime in the future, so stay tuned!

If you happen to encounter a particularly scary cryptid I give you the same advice, try to not pick its attention and leave as soon as possible. If you&#39;ve already alerted them, remember this simple fact: a cryptid isn&#39;t necessarily an evil monster with super powers. In most cases they are just animals, which means that you could feasibly escape them or, in case you have no other choice, kill them with a firearm or other lethal methods to neutralize them.

I personally prefer to not attempt to kill cryptids because, in the end, they are confused animals who most likely have entered a city because we&#39;re expanding too fast and invading their habitats, and it feels unfair and cruel to kill them just because they are scary. However, I also understand that animals can be aggressive and you don&#39;t really think about all the factors when you&#39;re in a situation like that. Capturing cryptids is fine but you need to be careful for both&#39;s safety.

And finally...

**__Phenomena__**. This is a bit harder to explain since it&#39;s not as common or popular as the previous categories - even I have some trouble defining this. The first examples that come to mind are reincarnation and psychic-related stuff, but these aren&#39;t really isolated phenomena but things that manifest in people.

I also thought of haunted houses or cursed forests, but that&#39;s more related to Spirits such as ghosts and it&#39;s more a consequence of such rather than a thing on its own right.

So I guess the things this category is for would be, idk, maybe a field where gravity is inverted or a playground that makes you want to play within it, which as you can see is not something that forms part of the worldwide urban spooky folklore and, at least personally, is not something I have heard of.

As such, I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t have much to tell you about this category in particular. As of now, it&#39;s entirely hypothetical, but let me know if you&#39;re aware of something that could fit in here and, if possible, your tips on handling these situations.

I think the closest to encountering yourself in a field affected by a paranormal phenomenon would be consuming drugs and being affected by them, but I can&#39;t really say since I don&#39;t do drugs and I very rarely try alcohol, always trying not to get drunk. I wouldn&#39;t want to make users feel pushed to share their experiences with drugs, especially if they had a bad time or if it makes them uncomfortable.

Also, please note that this comparison is not a valid excuse to consume drugs under the guise of preparing yourself to deal with a paranormal event.

And that would be what I&#39;ve been gathering through the years, thanks for coming to my TED talk. I have a couple more specific tips but I&#39;d rather share them separately to keep everything organized and to not make this post any more longer than what it already is. If you have doubts don&#39;t hesitate to hit me up, I check the page constantly.

something something xoxo and have a terrifying day!

Hello! Actually I kinda have my method for dealing with ghosts. It&#39;s a bit rudimentary but for what I&#39;ve tested it works. You basically need a piece of chalk to draw a circle on the floor, a few drops of blood, candles, and some religious-related item, like a cross or a Bible.

You draw a circle on the floor and put yourself in the middle, then place some candles around, but make sure to put a drop of blood wherever you plan to place the candles. The religious object is to remain within the circle and with you at all times.

&#39;ello spooky world!

St. Valentine&#39;s Day happened a couple days ago and while I don&#39;t have a date yet (I barely have contact with people besides my parents) I did spend the day with something I love: cryptids! So, after some time of researching, I come to present you my methods and &#34;contingency plans&#34; to deal with certain cryptids in particular should you encounter one of them or even if you wanted to capture them.

Let&#39;s start with probably the easiest one: The Chupacabra. My plan? Just rub some midazolam or a similar powerful anesthetic on a cow and wait for it to come. It will consume it and will fall unconscious, and you will be able to capture it with no risks. Just make sure to keep it in a secure enclosure so it does not escape.

Now, for my personal favorite: the Lovelock Frog! Honestly, that&#39;s just a regular frog but exceptionally big and bipedal, for some reason. I don&#39;t think such silly little creature would be dangerous at all so to capture it you would just need to use your hands and catch it. Contrary to popular belief, I think frogs and toads are lovely animals and I would be thrilled to ever capture or photograph this cryptid. I didn&#39;t come up with a plan to kill the Lovelock Frog because I couldn&#39;t possibly do it.

I bet you&#39;re dying to hear my plan to capture a bigfoot or a yeti, but I&#39;m sorry to disappoint you all: I don&#39;t think either is real. Besides, I don&#39;t think they are that complicated to capture - just bring a large net and, if you want to get rid of them, just use bullets. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this but I&#39;m kind of a monkey cryptid hater.

I&#39;d also talk about the elusive Mothman but, like I said before, I want to make a post specially dedicated to him because there&#39;s a lot to unpack.

For much more &#34;classic&#34; cryptids that resemble normal animals, like Zanzibar leopards or Eastern cougars, I think you should handle them like regular wild felines. Animal control isn&#39;t really my thing so I&#39;d leave that to the experts.

And I think this would be it for Part 1. I apologize if you were expecting a longer post, this is just the first entry, but stay tuned so you don&#39;t miss the follow-up posts! Feel free to let your suggestions for cryptids you&#39;d like me to formulate plans to capture! I&#39;ll also be accepting popular creepypasta characters because honestly I&#39;m tired of these evil guys to just be defeated for once.

Um, my Spanish isn&#39;t quite good, but I&#39;m pretty sure the protagonist of the creepypasta literally beats the blue pendrive... twice.
