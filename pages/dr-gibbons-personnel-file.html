------

**History:** Dr. P██████ Gibbons worked for the Scientific Police of the █████████ Republic as a Medical Examiner until involved with incident ████-██ (related to SCP-███, see document [DATA EXPUNGED] for more information regarding [DATA EXPUNGED]). In the light of the heavy loss of personnel in Site 19 after said incident ████-██, plus the loss of medical and on-site retrieval personnel during incident ███-24-██████-A, O5 directive found a valuable Foundation asset in Gibbons and opted to hire him as a low-level Foundation researcher instead of the usual administration of a class A amnesiac. Dr. Gibbons is currently working as a multi-purpose, Medical-wing oriented researcher until the issue on lack of personnel stabilizes.

**Personal Information:**

* Has a noticeable speech difficulty stemming from English not being his first language and a tendency to speak too quickly.
* Interests include: Sharpshooting, writing, reading, and &#34;a metric fuckton of other stuff.&#34;

__Addendum Gibbons-B__: 
//Will now dedicate all available time to brewing a coffee properly. If somebody like Clef ever gets to taste that colored water somebody will go on a killing spree. -O5-█//

**Note:** //Dr. Gibbons is not Dr. Bright. Dr. Bright is a gibbon. Dr. Gibbons does not need to display [[[SCP-963]]] at all times, and should not be treated with hostility if he does not display it. Please keep this in mind for future interactions.// -O5-6</textarea></pre>
