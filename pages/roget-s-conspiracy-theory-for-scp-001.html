Incident-001-Γ&#39;s definitive, canonical timeline is recorded on solid state databases. Two copies exist, one is located within a secured headquarters and the location of the other is known to the Overseers. &#34;Red Right Hand” has successfully seized all documentation of Incident-001-Γ which are not currently available to any public. Current theory is that as a result of SCP-001&#39;s effect, there exists no possibility for any trespassing within SCP-001&#39;s continuity via distortion of [[[scp-3780| time]]] and/or dimensional space.

Quality of life health insurance plans and any extraordinary medical expenses [[footnote]]Along with any other resources necessary to maintain a ‘stable’ lifestyle[[/footnote]] are to be provided to the witnesses of Incident-001-Γ. 

Massive publicizing and public re-affirmation of established perspectives on Incident-001-Γ are to be disseminated through both reputable and alternative news sources in order to blunt the spread of uncontrolled manufactured information. Marketing and production front companies are to fund independent media outlets creating, distributing, and selling advertising space on media catering to narrow niches of alternative perspectives which are rooted to or branched off of an Incident-001-Γ perspective variant.

----
SCP-001 is the projectile which killed U.S. President John F. Kennedy, fired by an unidentifiable number of assailants acting simultaneously as part of one or more conspiracies. Upon impact, human perception began falling out of sync with objective reality at an individual level.

The events surrounding SCP-001&#39;s trajectory are designated as Incident-001-Γ.

Although the divergent standards of objectivity are largely compatible enough to allow for human society to function, that does not mean they are not a threat to the long-term viability of human civilization and intelligent life as a whole. It is possible that the current formation of reality exists as a result of a [[[keter-duty| VK-Class reality restructuring scenario.]]]

]]

Individuals with living memory of Incident-001-Γ are the last population of humanity able to agree on any shared concept of truth, their shared experience in seeing or hearing about Incident-001-Γ. The percentage of still-living eyewitnesses negatively correlates to the density of unnatural potential energy manifesting in the observable universe as anomalous phenomenon.

Their collective memory provides a consistent base of widely, but not universally, held truths. This in turn stabilizes the increasingly individualized SCP-001 perspectives, as it is the last living shared 
certain truth among Earth&#39;s population. 

Witnesses who do not otherwise provide valued testimony and who have robust physiques may volunteer for experimental and indefinite life-extending experiments, in order to preserve the stabilizing effect their memory provides for as long as the human body can allow.

A statistically significant minority of witness testimony report variations on so-called &#34;Badge Man&#34;  even taking into account inflation caused by civilians seeing unfamiliar Secret Service and other security forces. The only conclusively proven participants in Incident-001-Γ are John Kennedy and Lee Oswald, although they did not have any prior contact. Other individuals have been named or described often enough to be viewed as persons of interest.

**Preamble:** As the increased veiling segmentation of the sheep has produced a confusing number of potential perspectives for personnel to be prepared for, a conclusive report on the development of more branching worldviews and how they may conflict with each other in order to properly prevent badsight is the accurate and correct way to maintain veiltruth. Interpersonal arguments are not considered to be infringing on the sanctity of veiltruth at this time as collated through this documentation.

+ S. I - Summary of Events &amp; Suspects
[[/=]]

On 11/22/1963, at 12:30 p.m, Lee Oswald fired two bullets from the sixth floor of the Texas Schoolbook Depository. Oswald&#39;s first shot missed, striking a concrete curb. The second shot mortally wounded the President and injured the Governor. A third shot (SCP-001) lethally vaporized U.S. President Kennedy&#39;s cranial cavity.

For the approximate decade between Incident-001-Γ and the ascension of President Gerald Ford, SCP-001&#39;s effect was widespread but largely benign. The disparity between perception and reality was growing, but gradually and in a linear fashion. The fractalization did not begin to occur until the failed attempt to assassinate President Ford on September 5, 1975 by Lynn &#34;Squeaky&#34; Fromme. 

[[include component:image-block
    name=ford|
    caption=38th U.S. President Gerald Ford exactly 11 years and 10 months after Incident-001-Γ.|
    width=600
]]

In both crowds, all witnesses reported seeing differing versions of the events, most of which did not have President Ford surviving. Two weeks later, Sara Jane Moore made a subsequent attempt on Ford&#39;s life in order to reconcile her knowledge of his death with his visible living person. The exponential spread of SCP-001&#39;s effect can be demonstrated by Gerald Ford&#39;s sincere belief from at least 1976 until his death that the Soviet Union had withdrawn from eastern Europe during the Nixon administration.

    caption=Alleged photograph documenting the &#39;Badge Man&#39;.|
    width=300
]]

Historical documents reflecting the official story are to suggest that it was the scandal which caused the proliferation of distorted information throughout society, and not the survival of President Ford.

Any scenario, whether there exists witness testimony or not, could be true given the ephemeral nature of truth and falsehood on a conceptual level.

&gt; [[collapsible show=&#34;Police Log - Babushka Lady&#34; hide=&#34;__Babushka Lady__&#34;]]
&gt; **Foreword:** //The so-called &#34;Babushka lady&#34; was briefly held in custody by the Dallas Police, giving a brief statement before she was released. There is no record as to when or why she was released from custody.//
&gt; 
&gt; **BL:** Yeah, I saw old man Zapruder with that &#39;camera&#39;, right? Pretty good view from that pillar, especially since the TV crew wasn&#39;t there to hog the space. I&#39;m sure a few frames with extra white puffs will just happen to go missing, right? 
&gt; 
&gt; (//Pause. Lighter flicking.//)
&gt; 
&gt; My grandmother loved to play the games she could win. Her favorite was //Find the Lady//. All you need is a ball, three cups, and a rube to play. There was never a shortage of eager and willing rubes.
&gt; 
&gt; Grammy relished in showing off every cup as slow as she could, then covering the ball and going to work once she had their trust. Rube watching, she&#39;d shuffle and move &#39;em all around fast as tilt-a-whirls. Rube, with luck, picks the right cup. Oh, the sweet talk she&#39;d use to string them along, come on, double down, let&#39;s play one more time, just for the laughs. Poor saps get convinced they&#39;ve sliced the gambling knot. Everyone was ready to think they were special. 
&gt;
&gt; We both had a sixth sense for knowing when rubes were getting ready to cash out. By then, they&#39;re not even the same person they were when the game started, not after they&#39;ve been on a hot streak long enough that the money&#39;s as good as half-spent to them.
&gt; 
&gt; Zapruder is being played as a shell game. That&#39;s the point. If you&#39;ve seen any home movies-- the shaky blurs, the way the timing always seems just a little &#39;off&#39;? That&#39;s by design. The unreality on the surface conceals that if you look at it hard enough, you&#39;ll find the fatal flaw. You&#39;ll find where the Lady is hiding. And never realize... there ain&#39;t no Lady to find.

&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:**  Anonymous tape recording by the alleged &#34;Umbrella Man&#34;, a person to speak to since he was seen in photographs holding an umbrella beside the motorcade on a sunny day.
&gt; 
&gt; //The Kennedy Administration has been a disaster for time and space.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Hello, if this take sounds good enough for government work, then it shall be dropping off outside one of your fake used bookstores that really trades in god-knows-what.//
&gt; 
&gt; //There are a million different ways I know you&#39;re looking for me, so don&#39;t bother looking for a leak. Waste of time. My name is Louie Steven Witt and you can come talk to me if you want to.//
&gt; 
&gt; //It was my intention to let President Kennedy know of my displeasure towards him. It was a secret symbol, the umbrella, one only he and I would know. Not only would it be disrespectful to the late President, but also his family line.//
&gt; 
&gt; //My umbrella can shoot blow darts, yes.  But it didn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t have any of them on me, I only brought this particular umbrella because it is my only black one. Came directly from the Prime Minister, oh, Neville, you ravishing cad.//
&gt; 
&gt; //I&#39;ve been so lonely since then. The last time I shared any great excitement. I could see the pallor  on the faces of passers-by. Truth be told, they probably all saw me the same way. Well, in each of their own little ways they saw me as they saw the world://
&gt; 
&gt; //Skewed, and a little cracked. Fragile, holding together, but, fundamentally?// 
&gt; 
&gt; //Broken.//

&gt; [[collapsible show=&#34;Secretary Reedy Tape&#34; hide=&#34;__Secretary Reedy__&#34;]]
&gt; **Foreword:** George Reedy was appointed Press Secretary by President Johnson after the latter&#39;s accession to power.
&gt; 
&gt; //I remember someone once told me Kennedy knew it was a killbox. 100% certainty. There were a thousand ways to die in Dealy Plaza, and Kennedy had made peace with all of them. Why? Back was killing him. The job was killing him.  Re-election looked likely, four more years of torture and then what?//
&gt; 
&gt; //No more hurting and, God-willing, heavenbound by the hands of another man.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Tragedy should make us come together as one. But now you, and I, and everything, it&#39;s split up in little black boxes, I&#39;m not paranoid. The walls have closed in and now we&#39;re standing straight up in the dark. I was there when it happened.//
&gt; 
&gt; //My first thanksgiving after, everybody on my Mom&#39;s side of the family was convinced that I had been convicted of the President&#39;s murder. Then, I started to remember it too. I could hear Lyndon&#39;s boasting that we would have the greatest administration of all time, and we&#39;d lick the Soviets too. Maybe it did happen that way, I haven&#39;t convinced myself enough to be sure. So... I know I squeezed a trigger but I can&#39;t remember whose hand it was I was squeezing, if that makes sense.//
&gt; 
&gt; //I don&#39;t like going out anymore, people all know. Some of them know. Others know other things. But I know that I don&#39;t know anything. Nothing true, at least.//

&gt; 
&gt; **RUBY:** My first thought was, &#34;It&#39;s over with. Mr. President, you have been avenged&#34;. Lighten up a little bit, ya pricks, the bad guy got his just desserts.
&gt; 
&gt; **RUBY:** You can’t be fucking serious. We all know he did it, right? Ah, you know, it was one of you blues that said I would do the world a favor if I capped him. I mean, maybe not thinking I would, but I can&#39;t say that he meant anything. Just that he told me to do it. 
&gt; 
&gt; **RUBY:** I’m gonna be just like Boston Corvette. Yeah the uh, the barn gun guy who did the pop at James Booth.
&gt; 
&gt; **RUBY:** You don’t need school to know what stuff is. I know one of your guys told me that I was gonna do it.
&gt; 
&gt; **RUBY:** He had a yellower, maybe kind of possibly could even be sunflower colored. 
&gt; 
&gt; **RUBY:** You know me, y’all can&#39;t treat me like a stranger. I&#39;m calm. I got it together now. 
&gt; 
&gt; **RUBY:** I did it, I’m proud of it and I’ll do it again if the little shit still has a pulse tomorrow. If my hands can stop shaking.
&gt; 
&gt; **RUBY:** So look, between you and me, and the guy, I know the guy who was at the alley door. Well, you know you know me! You all know me! So I told him I&#39;d get a good look for him. You know what he said to me? Joking, this is what he says to me, he says &#39;first drink is on me if ya plug him!&#39; but he had no idea. I really, I knew, but, I had no idea. 
&gt; 
&gt; **RUBY:** Guess he must feel a little shook up now. But I didn’t do it because he told me.
&gt; 
&gt; **RUBY:** I was coming back from sending one of my girls some cash, didn’t even decide if I would do it. Until I did it.
&gt; 
&gt; **RUBY:** Quit kidding around, you know I always have a piece on me. Just in case. Like tonight. You guys still have the coffee pot going this time of night? Right know I can feel my ticker going a mile a minute but after I crash I&#39;m going to need a boost to keep myself from dozing off on the way home.
&gt; 
&gt; **RUBY:** You&#39;re not funny. I&#39;m not gonna keep repeating myself. Saying the same thing over and over again so you screws can yuk it up when you make me trip on my own truth.
&gt; 
&gt; **RUBY:** Can&#39;t believe he did it with Jackie Oh right next to him. That poor woman. That poor, poor woman. How did someone that small shoot the President like that? Do you think it’s going to rain tomorrow?
&gt; 
&gt; **RUBY:** She had that coat, to pull out all the stops for the city. It’s the pink one. Someone told me it changed when her husband’s brains got all over it. I’m sorry Mr. President. You see, I didn’t want her to have to go through a trial when we all know he did it. There’s all this other horseshit they’d try to drag in. My club&#39;s a classy spot, so fine, why, say, do you fellas wanna maybe come tonight once we&#39;re done here? 
&gt; 
&gt; **RUBY:** It’s alright, I closed over the weekend but we’re still open tomorrow. 
&gt; 
&gt; **RUBY:** But it was one of you guys who told me to do it, so I’m okay to leave, right?

+ S. II - Individual-Aggregate Level Veil Effect
[[/=]]
----

The most common effect of SCP-001 is frustration. The belief that one is skilled, but unable to get a job, or that they are wonderful people yet nobody seems to like them. Unable to understand that they are being paid less than they think they are. Feeling cramped and confined even if they see themselves living in a big house all to themselves.

Wrongness is there, it can be felt, but it cannot be explained. It manifests in psychological disorders such as Imposter Syndrome. At a certain level, they know that they don&#39;t belong. One more way to feel the lonesomeness of SCP-001.

Those with less self-awareness may be promoted via the Dilbert Principle, that incompetent individuals will be promoted until they can no longer do damage. This is a natural organizational self-defense measure as the structure is aware something is wrong, even if none of the participants themselves are able to.

The so-called &#34;Mandela Effect&#34; arises when the degree to which any given person is out of sync with reality drifts further in their living memory, so that what was true to them once is no longer so. However, this is easily rationalized and is not considered to be damaging except in rare cases.

Analysis of social movements derived from SCP-001 was at first limited to immediate interpretation of the Kennedy Assassination, but following disruption of the assassination attempt on Gerald Ford and the subsequent lack of new renewals of blood, the fracturing of collective truth has continued on its path to disintegration.

When a critical mass of knowledge an individual is able to interpret as factual have no connection to reality as defined by physical laws and natural forces, it will frequently cause them to disconnect most of their familial and social relationships. This withdrawal is usually a result of frustration and confusion. They may begin to make new social connections in small networks of those who find that their alternative viewpoints overlap on at least some measures.

Even in these extreme cases, this does not prevent those with heavily altered viewpoints from carrying out the functions which have become routine. This is more a result of muscle memory, as their will to engage with the wider world is totally broken by their SCP-001 experience.

There is no purpose on speculating who killed President Kennedy. Every guess is correct to someone.

Nobody can see the world the same way as anyone else. That&#39;s just the way it is.

Normalcy is a comfort to those confused by SCP-001, and should be provided whenever possible.

We Secure, Contain, and Protect.

&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case N°:** 137718042 John Fitzgerald Kennedy Autopsy Report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;MALE | 46 | WHITE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;External Examination: Skin and hair of the President were rigid. There was a reddish residue coating most of the body&#39;s upper half. Eyes were open, eyelids too stiff to close. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying Marks: The President was identified via the hospital&#39;s portrait.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cranial cavity was badly damaged. Brain tissue had apparently been aerosolized. Most had been lost prior to arrival in the emergency room, but what remained had dissipated over everyone in the operating theater.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Internal Examination: Apart from cranial damage, nominal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cause of Death: Homicide, firearm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time of death: 12:30 PM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Attending Physician Notes: This was horrible. &lt;/br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;MALE | 46 | HOLLOW&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;External Examination: Skin and hair of the President were missing. There was a reddish residue coating most of the body&#39;s upper half. Eyes were open, shaved off. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying Marks: The President was identified via dental records.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cranial cavity was missing. Most of the Secret Service had gotten lost prior to arrival in the emergency room, but those who remained protected everyone in the operating theater.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Internal Examination: Too small.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cause of DeaththeConspiracyiseverywhereturningpeople into unnatural energy, grinding up that in their contained death boxes and then harvests the corpse to power their unnatural Overseers warped, tumorous bodies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They turn those energies into easy bake SCPs easy enough to trick any good person who interacts into thinking they&#39;re weird but they only live to die they&#39;re being fed back into the &#39;standard&#39; chambers why do you think they&#39;re standard they all must make death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
They grind them up to make them dead they grind them up and make them dead they grind you up and dead you dead make grint grind make grind it up. The Conspiracy perpetuates itself. The Conspiracy will perpetuate itself and lock us with it in the dark forever.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;

    &lt;div id=&#34;thirdCollapsible&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#&#34; onClick=&#34;showHide(&#39;thirdText&#39;);&#34;&gt;Why can&#39;t we just let there be light?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id=&#34;thirdText&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal Examination: Attending physician entered into the cranial cavity for further examine the patient. &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;

    &lt;div id=&#34;fourthText&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
The rim was jagged and It tore my scrubs as I pulled myself through, thank god it didn&#39;t scratch me. It was wet in there, and it smelled like an old fish tank. The walls felt like soft peaches, and there were little holes everywhere. I looked inside one, and I saw inside a family house. A portrait of Douglass MacArthur was hanging on the wall.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
I saw a flash, and a mushroom cloud in the window.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m blind in that eye now. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;fifthCollapsible&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#&#34; onClick=&#34;showHide(&#39;fifthText&#39;);&#34;&gt;If you watch the zapruder film enough times you start to notice more people in it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id=&#34;fifthText&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Kept walking. The deep holes got bigger and when the light from the hole was gone the portholes glow was all that kept things from soft, pitch black darkness&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Out of every single one is a cold hate to go up your spine without any reason at all, to let you get yourself in a spot of rage and stoke it all the time but you don&#39;t know why. A lone archer isn&#39;t supposed to be able to topple Camelot. It had to more important, an uncountable volley from every conceivable nook, cranny, or sewer grate right into the Symbol. There is one thing that can make everyone feel that hate, that blind rage, every single one of them stemming from this snapped continuum point. I go deeper. Even the small hole&#39;s beams of light went away. Each one projected every possible terrible future in a twisted dystopian kaleidoscopic light show.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;sixthCollapsible&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#&#34; onClick=&#34;showHide(&#39;sixthText&#39;);&#34;&gt;You&#39;re complicit now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id=&#34;sixthText&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;border-style: solid; background-color: #e6e6e6; font-size:20; border-width: medium; border-color: red; padding: 10px;&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;It thinks only to Secure itself, leaving us to show them the way through the valley of mines with our blood.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It Contains the aspirations of mortals everywhere to be greater than just human resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It Protects itself at the expense of all else, all that matters is continued survival and preserving the status quo.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Normalcy is the Conspiracy&#39;s founding lie.
