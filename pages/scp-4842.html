**Item #:** SCP-4842

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4842-1 is to be contained in an anechoic locker at Site-28.

Manifestations of SCP-4842-2 are contained in an anechoic display with a specialized internal microphone; a Foundation agent embedded in the local anartist scene is to maintain this display under the guise of it being an art installation. As SCP-4842-2 instances cease all anomalous activity after playing, it is to be removed from its location and recycled as needed.

**Description:** SCP-4842-1 is a boombox which operates at maximum volume for its model without the need for a power source. The only recording that has played since its discovery and subsequent containment are field recordings of trains passing nearby the microphone. The recording lasts for 30 minutes and 29 seconds. After it finishes, the recording loops and plays again. SCP-4842-1 was discovered and initially cataloged as AO-17-051902 on 01/05/2015. It was reclassified as SCP-4842-1 following Recording-4842-Beta.[[footnote]]See Addendum 4842-B.[[/footnote]]

SCP-4842-2 is a boombox which manifests at 40°██&#39;██.█&#34;N 74°██&#39;██.█&#34;W once every 177 days, thereafter playing at maximum volume without the need for a power source. Recordings played from SCP-4842-2 vary in content and length; two individuals are present on all recordings, identified as Jensen Kortland and Alix Cuthbertson. Interviews with the individuals in question have revealed that neither are aware of SCP-4842 or its associated phenomena, and that neither have visited the state of ████████, having lived on Martha&#39;s Vineyard together since April 7th, 2013.

&gt; 
&gt; **K:** You got me there, I guess. How long until we can go?
&gt; 
&gt; **C:** I just need to win this map! I definitely have it now since there&#39;s just --

&gt; 
&gt; **C:** YES! Eat shit!
&gt; 
&gt; **K:** Fuuuuck, at least don&#39;t yell that loud. I&#39;ll go put my shoes on and start the car.
&gt; 
&gt; **C:** Took me long enough! Listen, we also need to get AAs as well so find a, uh...
&gt; 
&gt; **K:** I thought they didn&#39;t need those.
&gt; 
&gt; **C:** No, but you need them to effectively use your magic. Right, a Radioshack, if those still exist around here.

&gt; **K:** Oh, yeah yeah. We need to buy a keyboard there too, right?
&gt; 
&gt; **C:** Yeah, then we stop by ███████ and it&#39;ll go down on the train tracks.
&gt; 
&gt; **K:** And it works?
&gt; 
&gt; **C:** Lucy said she did it and it&#39;s worked for her, but it feels like being on shrooms so you have to --
&gt; 
&gt; **K:** Yeah.
&gt; 
&gt; **C:** You know, gotta be careful. She said &#34;not all of you lines up with you&#34;, something like that.

&gt; **K:** We shouldn&#39;t have even done it more than once.

&gt; **C:** Nothing went wrong the first time, why would something go wrong again?
&gt; 
&gt; **K:** I know what I&#39;m hearing. It still rung in my ears even in Massachusetts.[[footnote]]Jensen Kortland visited Rhode Island a day prior to the playback of Recording 4842-Beta for undisclosed reasons. Alix Cuthberson stated during questioning that Kortland may have visited a relative, though this could not be confirmed.[[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **C:** Let&#39;s just chill tonight, okay? I wanna spend Christmas with you.
&gt;

&gt; **Involved Individuals/Anomalies:** SCP-4842
&gt; 
&gt; **Report:** On 12/13/2016, at 09:03 AM, SCP-4842-2&#39;s display case shattered during a recording. This recording deviates from previous recordings, consisting of a single sustained train horn for 4 minutes and 35 seconds. Individuals in the area were examined for possible cognitohazardous containment, and amnescitized afterwards.
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-4842-1&#39;s recording during this time period differed, consisting of incomprehensible voices from Jensen Kortland and Alix Cuthbertson, with the possible sound of fire in the background. Neither Jensen Kortland and Alix Cuthbertson reported unusual activity or mood changes that day. Upon follow-up questioning the next day, their home was found abandoned. Various types of batteries and keyboards were spilled across the living room floor, along with a miniature model train, 8 grams of marijuana, and an artistic depiction of severed ears located under a bed mattress.
