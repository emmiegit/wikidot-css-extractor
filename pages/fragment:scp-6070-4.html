+++ Description
SCP-6070 (&#34;Gutenberg-Engine&#34;) is a closed-loop temporal bootstrap paradox created by the Temporal Anomalies Department in 2793. The device utilized in its creation was an anomalous rocket thruster invented by Foundation researchers in 1985 and constructed in 1991.

Originally, the device was going to be decommissioned in 1993, but this was prevented through the creation of the temporal bootstrap paradox in 2793, which also caused the modification in 2093. Further modifications of the device in 2793 allow draining energy from the inner time-loop which was coupled to [[span style=&#34;color: rgb(var(--basalt-alternate-color))&#34;]]SCP-1950-ADK[[/span]][[footnote]] System notification: broken link [[/footnote]]. The energy being drained from the system was involuntarily introduced into the system in the time period between 27.02.1993 and 27.02.2793 through a Thermal Singularity Valve Generation 1.

In 2793, the device was incorporated into the [[span style=&#34;color: rgb(var(--basalt-alternate-color))&#34;]]ARC project[[/span]][[footnote]] System notification: broken link [[/footnote]] as a fuel source. At the time of the [[span style=&#34;color: rgb(var(--basalt-alternate-color))&#34;]]SCP-28880[[/span]][[footnote]] System notification: broken link [[/footnote]] breach event and subsequent ADK-Class &#34;Complete Anomalous Destabilization&#34; Scenario, several energy sources for the ARC project were considered. Through the induction of [[span style=&#34;color: rgb(var(--basalt-alternate-color))&#34;]]SCP-16724-ADK[[/span]][[footnote]] System notification: broken link [[/footnote]] the Temporal Anomalies Department created a bootstrap temporal paradox to sink enough energy into SCP-6070 to power the colonization vessel during its acceleration phase, which made SCP-6070 the prime candiate for the ARC project. SCP-6070 is able to power the colonization vessel for exactly 100 years from 27.02.2793 to the 27.02.2893, at which point the acceleration phase will be completed and SCP-6070 will cease to function. Note, that SCP-6070 cannot be used for the deceleration phase and an alternative energy source must be found before this phase begins.

I will interject here. My name is Julia Assam. I am the SCP-6070 head researcher in 2594 and therefore tasked to relay this document back in time as requested in 1993. However, this document draws a terribly misleading picture of what is going on.

SCP-6070 will be classified as thaumiel in 2793, however this is practically a joke. When we decided to stop the decommissioning of SCP-6070, it was meant as a fail-safe for whatever scenario it will be needed in. The scenario turned out to be SCP-28880, and sparing you the details, it is fucked up. Reality began falling apart around us, and it took us years to figure out why. We have areas the size of cities, where reality collapses and it is getting more and more difficult to contain those areas and prevent the anomalies in there from getting out and spreading SCP-28880.

SCP-6070 is meant as a fail-safe (that was probably decided by Overwatch in 1993), but somewhere between the current year and 2793, some higher-ups decide that we will focus our resources in an inter-galaxy colonization vessel and peace out. SCP-6070 is no longer a contingency measure, it is not a fail-safe, it is a get-out-of-jail-free card for the O4s and O5s, some other powerful megalomaniacs and a few hundred &#34;important&#34; people. I am convinced we can save a lot of people, normalcy and probably our planet, if we focus our resources and manage our time correctly. We have some promising leads about 28880, but we need time and a lot of money.

//SCP-6070 must be destroyed!// It provides an easy solution for a few privileged and thus shatters any hope of a real solution. A lot of money will flow into this colonization project and we need that money. I propose a joint venture by all pre-2793 time periods (off the records) to find a way to take SCP-6070 away from the Foundation, to force the development of an actually working solution. Before relaying this document, I will send the update to 2694, so they are up to speed.

[[div class=&#34;proceedings&#34;]]
My name is Dr. Munik, I am part of the joint research team for SCP-6070 in 2694, which has been integrated into the research team for SCP-28880. I think I can shed some light on the decision to build the vessel, as it has already happened (if only in a planning stage). To say the political climate is tense would be an understatement.

A few months ago we lost San Francisco, Gothenburg and Baku in just one night to 28880. Sweden collapsed under the tragedy, there is no government in place anymore. The Seljuk Accord on the other hand is looking for a scape-goat, so we lost diplomatic support for most sites in the middle east. The veil is pretty much done for. Our remaining assets are limited. Consensus among the O4s is that we have only one shot at a solution.

I am withholding this document from the extended SCP-28880 team, because while I agree that a solution for 28880 can be found only without SCP-6070, this opinion isn&#39;t really popular here anymore. However, the Temporal Anomalies Department has been siding with the 28880 team for a decade now, so I must ask a previous iteration of the department to find a solution. I will cover on this end for the time being.

Hello. My name is Dr. C. Haser, I am part of the Temporal Anomalies Department in 2494. Since 28880 hasn&#39;t happened yet, it is hard to estimate in what scope we are operating. For now, I did not escalate this matter, because I suspect this will alert the proper administration in your time periods as well.

I have looked at the available information and since we are pretty sure SCP-6070 is a bootstrap paradoxon, I have come up with an idea that does not hinge on our limited understanding of bootstrap paradoxa. Since we are currently unsure if a bootstrap paradoxon can be broken, I propose we create a secondary bootstrap paradoxon that traps the first. Conceptually this should be feasible. We need to create something that already existed in 1991, so we encapsulate the entire project and then causally link its existance with the destruction of SCP-6070.

I propose we move this discussion to dedicated documentation and send this thread to all time periods, so all Temporal Anomalies Departments, jeopardized by 28880 or not, can join forces. I am forwarding this thread forwards and backwards in time and await your responses.

Hello, this is Researcher Morrow. I am a technician working with SCP-6070 in 2695, and must inform you that Dr. Munik died a week ago, when a memetic agent was sent through SCP-6070. The agent was designed to force Dr. Munik to relay and the message back in time, and then kill Dr. Munik, however the message was not relayed and Munik died through a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Investigations are ongoing.

I will now relay this information back to 1995, as per Special Containment Procedures.

Clytemnestra Smith of the Ethics Committee, 2495. Dr. Haser is currently subject of investigation after an instance of [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7777|SCP-7777]]] has been produced by SCP-6070 that has brought to light severe transgressions of Dr. Haser. SCP-6070 is under temporary purview of the Ethics Committee. I am afraid the project discussed in this thread is currently on hold.

Shortly after this document reached Foundation researchers in 1995, a second document was sent through SCP-6070 which is appended below.
[[/div]]


[[div class=&#34;document&#34;]]
+ Overwatch Command
+++ Internal Memo

**Item #:** SCP-6070
**Subject:** Regarding SCP-6070 in 1995, 2095, 2195, 2295, 2395, 2495, 2595, and 2695

To whom it may concern in the past,

First, I want to apologize for the loss of Dr. Munik, Dr. Assam, and the trouble Dr. Haser is in. It was not the intention of my team to harm anyone. The actions we took against Foundation researchers and GOC personnel were sufficient in halting any and all decommissioning attempts under the respective safe-guards your teams had set in place.

Contrary to the theories put forth by Dr. Assam, however, we do not wish to stop you from decommissioning SCP-6070, and we also do not wish to harm you. The problem is the memetic filter created in 1993. It not only renders us incapable of disassembling SCP-6070 ourself, it also forces us to prevent any decommissioning attempt, that we know of, by any means necessary.

SCP-6070 was created in 2793 because it was seen as our last hope of escaping SCP-28880 and saving at least a seedling of humanity. As Dr. Assam corectly put it, this is a far cry from an actual solution, so we never wanted to use SCP-6070 this way. But it is a bootstrap paradoxon. It must have been created, because it had already existed for 700 years at that point. Equally, SCP-28880 must happen and cannot be contained, because SCP-6070 wouldn&#39;t have been created otherwise. No solution for SCP-28880 can be found until SCP-6070 is destroyed. We already failed, so I must ask you to fix this mistake.

The memetic filter forces us to stop you from destroying SCP-6070. Any and all documentation you generate will force us to halt you from destroying it though. I therefore propose [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6070/offset/5|new containment procedures]]] and leave you with a plead: Destroy SCP-6070 before it is being created. And don&#39;t talk about it.

In hopes of a better past,
O5-10, 2795
