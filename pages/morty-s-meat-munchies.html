Dear Sir or Madam,

This letter concerns some problems that I had with your product Woppy Poppy, that I bought from the Amusement Foodstore, a store near my house.

My dissatisfaction comes from the fact that some of the popcorn is as hard as a rock and doesn&#39;t taste like popcorn at all. My grandson broke his teeth while eating one of these strange corns mixed within the common ones.  As I know Amusement Foodstore and am a long time customer of the store, I&#39;m sure that they have not adulterated your product.

To provide my point, I&#39;m also sending you a photo of one of the strange &#34;popcorns&#34; and the receipt of the purchase. If needed, I can also post you another faulty Woppy Poppy example that I&#39;ve bought together with the already opened one so you can witness the problem. I&#39;m requesting two new packages of popcorn without the problem of the exotic corn.

Please contact me as soon as possible to solve this issue. I&#39;m free to give further information about the situation if needed. Thank you for the attention.

Yours faithfully,

Ann Mary Carmichael

Dear Sir/Madam

I had problems with your Frozen Feast Nuggets product. I&#39;ve bought some at a local store on my street and I&#39;ve noticed that most of them taste or smell rotten, even within the expiration date. I also know that it&#39;s not a case of bad luck, as acquaintances of mine also complained about your Frozen Feast products (including Pizzas, Lasagnas, and Meat Pies) looking spoiled.

As I&#39;ve researched from my neighbors, family, and friends, most of the products that present this issue are red meat flavors, but some of the white meat varieties also showed decaying and molds. None of the vegetarian or vegan products seems to suffer from this, so the root of the problem may be within how you are dealing with your animal products.

I&#39;ve conserved the nuggets that I&#39;ve bought so I can post you if necessary. I&#39;m also attaching the receipt of the purchase in the mail. I hereby requesting the value of my purchase back, as I&#39;m not willing to buy or taste any of your products hereafter.

Contact me by 12nd of February of 1955 to confirm your response to my complaint.

Sincerely,

Austin Beauford

Dear Sir or Madam,

I&#39;m concerned about one of your canned food brands, the SHAM brand. My family and I are long time fans of your pork meat, which has this singular taste, seemly stronger than other brands taste. As a long time customer, I felt the necessity to mail you about the event that occurred at the last time we opened one of your products. 

I opened a can that presented bones similar to knuckles inside of it. As my husband is a medical examiner that works with our cities&#39; Policial Department, he could conclude that the items were osseous matter of a still unidentified animal. I asked twenty other buyers of your brand and one of them also had similar experiences in a different moment.

I have purchased your products since 1952 when your brand first came to Kentucky. As I&#39;m so true to your company, I demand not only an explanation but also a substitution of the cans with bones inside. If you don&#39;t respond to my letter soon, I&#39;ll make sure that the authorities get my message to investigate your factories and warehouses.

Yours truly,

Janice Stevens

+++ FOOD FOR CANNIBALS
A Food Company has been closed under suspicion of using human meat in their products.
[[/=]]
^^//Written by Paul Harris//^^
[[==]]

Morty&#39;s Meat &amp; Munchies, a private company based in New Orleans, was closed yesterday after an inspection of the health surveillance. The company was founded in March of 1948 by  [*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/anthropological-report-darkwater Mortimer Duvernay], a businessman born and raised in the city. It was famous as a multi-brand company from Louisiana, fabricating famous products as the Woppy Poppy popcorn, Frozen Feast line of frozen food and SHAM&#39;s canned cooked pork. As the company expanded, some claims of rotten food, strange tastes, and canned human bones were made by the customers.

Ann Mary Carmichael, 63 years old, discovered human and animal teeth within Morty&#39;s popcorn brand, Woppy Poppy. &#34;I bought it thrice,&#34; explained Mrs. Carmichael. &#34;I thought they were just weird shaped kernels!&#34;

Abraham Stevens, a medical examiner from the Policial Department of Evergreen, Kentucky, was the first official to engage in the search for answers about the case. &#34;My family ate these products for several years and we never noticed anything,&#34; he said to our reporters. &#34;As our office crossed information, we discovered that the first unusual incident was stated in 1952, which curiously coincides with the exponential growth of Mr. Duvernay&#39;s business.&#34;

The investigations found out that the first usage of exotic meat was made between 1951 and 1952. The products used flesh from diverse animals, including cats, dogs, rats, birds, and humans. Although it is already confirmed that the animals&#39; usage was purposeful, interviews and medical examination of identified workers of the company showed the possibility that the human meat was accidental. The employees had lost fingers and teeth due to work accidents and bad hygiene. Nevertheless, the company was closed by the authorities.

Even so, theories involving local crimes created panic in the population. Buildings of the company are suspiciously close to a swamp well known for being used by criminals to deposit victims&#39; corpses. Not long ago, in December of 1954, Joe Sinclair, a gangster, revealed the location of six corpses in the marshland, but none of them was found. Beggars and homeless people that lived next to Duvernay&#39;s constructions also have faded during the last months. The connection between the crimes and vanishings is considered just a hypothesis by the Police.

Mr. Duvernay disappeared at the beginning of the investigations and, as for now, is still missing. He was described as a 6 feet tall, thin man with a strange scar that looks like a chicken&#39;s footmark on his left cheek. Any information regarding Mortimer Duvernay is to be passed to the local Police Department as fast as possible.
