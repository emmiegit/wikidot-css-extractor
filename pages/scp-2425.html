**Item #:** SCP-2425

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2425 is to be kept in a 10.5m x 8.5m x 5m containment cell in Reliquary Site-25[[footnote]] Reliquary Site-25 is dedicated to the Containment of several dangerous Euclid-class religious anomalies related to several Groups of Interest.[[/footnote]]. The cell is to be outfitted with one stage meant for the performance of dramatic acts, specifically musicals. At 16:00 EST on every second Friday of the month, a performance of a single song from a musical with religious themes is to be performed by volunteer Foundation researchers with some form of musical skill.

The list of approved musicals includes:

* //Jesus Christ Superstar// (Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice)
* //Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat// (Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice)
* //The Prince of Egypt// (Dreamworks Animation, dir. Simon Wells, Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner)
* //The Fiddler on the Roof// (Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick)
* //The Book of Mormon// (Trey Parker, Matt Stone, and Robert Lopez)

The following Sunday, a sermon is to be given by a Foundation-appointed religious authority regarding either Exodus 20:3-6, the Book of Leviticus, a passage from the Book of Mormon, a reading from the Torah, a reading from the Qu&#39;ran, or the Horizon Initiative&#39;s Universal Text, if available.

Following this, a replica of an instance of [[[SCP-1425]]] is to be burned within two meters of SCP-2425. If a replica is unavailable, a copy of a film that Steffan Bristow has performed in may be substituted.

It is to be publicly maintained that the actor Steffan Bristow died on January 4th, 2010 of a drug overdose in his room at the [REDACTED] Hotel in New York City. Films that star or feature Steffan Bristow may continue to be distributed, provided they have been scrubbed of Memetic Vector 2425-01, which involves the deletion of no more than five frames of film from the final cut.

**Description:** SCP-2425 is an android originally made to resemble Steffan Bristow, a Dutch-American actor and member of the Fifth Church. SCP-2425 has a frame made out of an iron alloy similar to Damascus steel, but with approximately 15% more nanotube structures present in SCP-2425 than in the average specimen of the alloy. Upon recovery, SCP-2425 was covered by an anatomically correct approximation of Steffan Bristow&#39;s appearance, made out of human skin with an exact DNA match to Mr. Bristow.

SCP-2425&#39;s primary anomalous effect occurred when it was part of the production of a major motion picture, specifically during its appearances on-camera [[footnote]] Voice acting done by SCP-2425 does not carry anomalous effects. [[/footnote]]. When appearing on-camera for a duration of more than fifty-five seconds, SCP-2425&#39;s eyes glow on-screen. Following this, a short, memetic message flashes on the screen, known as Memetic Vector 2425-01 (hereafter M.V. 2425-01). M.V. 2425-01 usually takes the form of a quote from Fifth Church scripture, a lyric from a Fifthist hymn or song, or a passage from one of the early chapters of SCP-1425. This effect occurs only five times per movie SCP-2425 is featured in, and only occurs for a single frame at a time.

If individuals that have not undergone Level-2 Inoculation against Memetic Vector 2425-01 are exposed to it, they will develop an interest in Steffan Bristow&#39;s life, leading to affected individuals attempting to find information about Bristow, his films, and any other actors featured within them. This will eventually lead individuals affected by M.V. 2425-01 to information on the Fifth Church. This further leads to up to 20-27% of individuals affected by M.V. 2425-01 to joining the Fifth Church. Post-exposure inoculation within 52 hours can lead to up to a 59% decrease in interest on the subject of Steffan Bristow.

A secondary anomalous effect occurs when SCP-2425 is in its powered-on state. When in this state, various news media outlets located in the Hollywood Area will report stories about Steffan Bristow&#39;s continued existence, being held by a &#39;shadow-governmental agency&#39;. These are believed to be transmissions broadcast by SCP-2425 in an attempt to free itself from containment.

SCP-2425 is powered by an anomalous power source, designated SCP-2425-A. SCP-2425-A is a form of battery that is powered and recharged by specific vibrational frequencies. These frequencies are produced by the human voice during the vocalization of songs by the band [[[fifthist-hub|Constellation Starfish]]] (a group affiliated with the Fifth Church) including singing, humming, or simply speaking the lyrics; a single word from the song [[[chilly-the-space-trucker|&#34;Old Chilly the Space Trucker&#34;]]], intoned as conceived by the composing artist,  was found to produce enough energy to power SCP-2425 for approximately five hours.

--Currently, a way to drain SCP-2425&#39;s power has not been discovered. As such, it has been classified as a Keter-Class anomaly due to the threat it posses to the Foundation&#39;s mission of secrecy.-- See Experiment Logs.

**Experiment Log 2425-D:** The following records Foundation attempts to power down SCP-2425.

**Test #:** 001
**Hypothesis:** SCP-2425 could be disabled by removing SCP-2425-A
**Procedure:** D-Class personnel would attempt to manually remove SCP-2425-A.
**Result:** Upon contact with SCP-2425-A, D-Class personnel D-2812 was electrocuted by SCP-2425-A and immediately died.
**Conclusion:** Manual removal of SCP-2425-A impossible with bare hands.

**Test #:** 002
**Hypothesis:** See Test # 001
**Procedure:** See Test #001, but D-Class personnel would have full-body electrical insulation.
**Result:** Electrical charge somehow bypassed insulation; however, resultant electrical shock was not fatal. D-Class Personnel D-2813 complained of having &#39;a song stuck in his head&#39; until end-of-month retirement.
**Conclusion:** Manual removal of SCP-2425 is impossible.

**Test #:** 005
**Hypothesis:** Due to the fact that SCP-2425-A was apparently powered by Fifthist hymns, Dr. Eldridge hypothesized that hymns from other religions could de-power SCP-2425-A.
**Procedure:** A small choir of volunteer Foundation researchers was instructed to sing the hymns &#34;Amazing Grace&#34; and &#34;God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen&#34;.
**Result:** No change in power levels in SCP-2425-A; broadcast reporting a sighting of Steffan Bristow in the town of [REDACTED], approximately fifteen kilometers from where SCP-2425 was located, was reported by an NBC news affiliate in Hollywood.   

**Test #:** 011
**Hypothesis:** Dr. Eldridge hypothesized that a Jewish hymn would depower SCP-2425-A.
**Procedure:** Originally, it was intended for the song &#34;Ma Nevu&#34; to be performed by volunteer researchers who were fluent in Hebrew; however, Dr. Eldridge&#39;s research assistant mistakenly obtained a Hebrew translation of lyrics to the song &#34;To Life (L&#39;chayim)&#34;  from the musical //Fiddler on the Roof//.
**Result:** Recognizing the tune approximately thirty seconds into the song, Dr. Eldridge ordered the test be terminated, with a repeat of the test to be scheduled for a later date.

However, Dr. Eldridge noted that SCP-2425&#39;s movements appeared more sluggish following this test.  

**Conclusion:** Further testing necessary.

**Test #:** 012
**Hypothesis:** Songs related to religion, but not explicitly used in religious ceremonies or gatherings, would be effective in depowering SCP-2425-A.
**Procedure:** Dr. Eldridge selected three songs to be sung by volunteer researchers: &#34;Hello&#34; from the musical //The Book of Mormon//, &#34;The Man Comes Around&#34; by Johnny Cash, and &#34;The Christmas Shoes&#34; by the group NewSong.
**Result:** Of the three songs, &#34;Hello&#34; was the most effective, with &#34;The Christmas Shoes&#34; and &#34;The Man Comes Around&#34; having little to no effect. Upon the conclusion of &#34;Hello&#34;, SCP-2425 had severely impeded movement. It is hypothesized that this power drain was due to the number of singers required to perform &#34;Hello&#34; being larger than the other two songs.
**Conclusion:** Songs related to religion, but not explicitly religious in content, will have some effect on SCP-2425-A.

//Note from Dr. Eldridge: I&#39;d just like to state, on the record, that seeing those researchers sing a song from that Mormon musical is the happiest I&#39;ve seen them in a while.//

**Test:** 014
**Hypothesis:** See Test 12, with the addendum that the larger the group singing the song, the more effective the power drain.
**Procedure:** The song &#34;Go, Go, Go Joseph&#34; from the musical //Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat// would be performed by volunteer researchers; in Broadway productions, this song required at least fifteen people to effectively perform.
**Result:** Upon conclusion of the song, SCP-2425 saw no further power drain than from previous tests; approximately 50% power drain.
**Conclusion:** While the musical method is effective, alternate methods must be found for fully depowering SCP-2425-A.

//Note from Researcher Mayberry, Research Assistant to Dr. Eldridge: Everyone was laughing after that test. Some of them even started dancing; they really got into it. Think we could do that again, Doc?//

//Note From Dr. Eldridge: It is under consideration.//

**Test #:** 017
**Hypothesis:** Destruction of objects related to the Fifth Church would result in further power drain.
**Procedure:** Test Denied. Items related to the Fifth Church are considered valuable artifacts.

**Test #:** 018
**Hypothesis:** See Test # 017
**Procedure:** A mockup of an instance of SCP-1425 was created, and then incinerated in front of SCP-2425 and several present researchers.
**Result:** Despite the instance not being authentic, SCP-2425 completely powered down upon destruction of the object.
**Conclusion:** See Addendum

**Addendum: Official Proposal from Dr. William Eldridge:**

&gt; **To:** O5-9
&gt; **Subject:** SCP-2425 Containment Revision
&gt; Reliquary Site-25 is probably one of the most frustrating places to work in the Foundation. Before I came here, I was a theologian, yes, but I was also an atheist. Seeing things like [REDACTED] shook me to my core. God was real, //all// Gods were real, and they could kill us at any time, trigger the apocalypse by sneezing.
&gt; 
&gt; It is rare that we make any breakthroughs here. I&#39;ve had two people on my team commit suicide by SCP out of sheer frustration from banging their heads against the wall and never getting a result.  
&gt; 
&gt; I am happy to report that we have made progress: a way to effectively neutralize SCP-2425, and any other possible instances of it. A combination of spiritual (not explicitly religious) music, performed by a large number of people, along with the apparent destruction of materials related to the Fifth Church, has resulted in a complete powering-off of SCP-2425. As I write this, it has been inactive for the past week.
&gt; 
&gt; I have attached to this e-mail revised containment procedures for SCP-2425, which have been revised by members of my team.  It is simple, cost-effective, and it works. I recommend implementation as soon as possible.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. William Eldridge,
&gt; Hazardous Materials Containment Liaison, Reliquary Site-25.

&gt; **To:** Dr. William Eldridge
&gt; **Subject:** Re: SCP-2425 Containment Revision.
&gt;
&gt; Approved. Implement these procedures immediately. Good work, Dr. Eldridge.
