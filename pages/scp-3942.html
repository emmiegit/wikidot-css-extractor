**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment Chamber #3942, located at Site-39, must be kept structurally sound at all times. Any damage to the containment chamber must be repaired immediately. Containment Chamber #3942 must always be kept within the area of effect of at least two active Scranton Reality Anchors. No personnel are to enter Containment Chamber #3942 without prior approval from at least three on-site personnel with Level 4 or higher clearance.

A minimum of four cooked trout must be deposited into Containment Chamber #3942 at least three times each day. Test subjects or personnel entering Containment Chamber #3942 are encouraged to deposit additional servings of trout, if able.

D-24390 has been designated as a high-priority Person of Interest. D-24390, and all known associates, must be apprehended for interrogation.

**Description:** {{PENDING}}

**Provenance:** Foundation agents were dispatched to Bingara, Australia on 27 June 2017 following reports of widespread panic and mass evacuation of the area. Questioning by attending agents was ineffective, as residents would not provide information explaining their panic or reason for evacuation; however, the agents were directed by civilians to several areas in and around the town.

After requesting for assistance, the attending agents cooperated with Mobile Task Force Epsilon-6 (&#34;Village Idiots&#34;); while inappropriate for the situation, the cooperation successfully minimised incurred injuries. MTF E-6 requested use of Containment Chamber #3942 (Approved), devising and initiating containment procedures upon arrival.

The surviving residents and ex-residents of Bingara were amnestised.

&gt; **Test Log 35**
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** D-24390

&gt; **Procedure:** D-24390 instructed to enter Containment Chamber #3942 with a single cooked trout, and to remain inside for one hour.
&gt; 
&gt; **Results:** D-24390 enters Containment Chamber #3942, discarding the cooked trout inside. Subject expresses happiness for five minutes before expressing concern. Security teams prepare to recover Subject forcefully. Subject speaks in hushed tones.
&gt; 
&gt; Eleven minutes after entering Containment Chamber #3942, Subject utilises [[[SCP-028 | knowledge obtained from previous assignment]]] to generate a rudimentary kinetoglyph[[footnote]]From the [[[SCP-1730 | Site-13 research file]]] on 86243AR-001 “Malidramagiuan”, “//Kinetoglyphs, or kinetohazards, are mental and physical hazards that occur when an entity performs specific gestures and motions […]//.” For further information, see Footnote 3 of SCP-1730 documentation, and/or Addendum 1730.9.[[/footnote]] with their hands, blocking security personnel from entering Containment Chamber #3942. Security personnel report a containment breach in progress.
&gt; 
&gt; Subject demonstrates how to construct the components of an elaborate kinetoglyph with their hands. Security personnel begin to physically destroy the initial barrier; Subject focuses their attention on preserving it while the elaborate kinetoglyph is constructed. Upon completion, the second kinetoglyph generates a temporary space-time manifold to an unknown location. Subject utilises the manifold to breach containment.
&gt; 
&gt; Security personnel equipped with a portable Scranton Reality Anchor arrive, and immediately activate it. All kinetoglyphs within the area of influence immediately dissipate, along with their produced anomalous effects.

&gt; **Test Log 36**
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** D-24407
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedure:** D-24407 instructed to enter Containment Chamber #3942 with four cooked trout, and to remain inside for one hour.
&gt; 
&gt; **Results:** D-24407 enters Containment Chamber #3942, immediately discarding all cooked trout. Subject requests to leave (Denied).
