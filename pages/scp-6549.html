&gt; ++ **SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES**
&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-6549 is currently contained in the Site-49-G Anomalous Weaponry Testing Antichamber (AWTA), in which it was initially constructed. Given that SCP-6549 is actively utilized by Foundation personnel in the containment of several other anomalies also held at Site-49-G, access to SCP-6549 does not require prior authorization from Site Command. All Foundation personnel possessing Level 2 clearance or higher are permitted to enter the Site-49-G AWTA at any time so long as posted safety protocols are followed. Physical contact with SCP-6549 or connected machinery, however, requires Level 4 clearance and prior approval from Site Command. 
&gt; 
&gt; Under no circumstances are personnel in close proximity to SCP-6549 permitted to exit the Site-49-G AWTA without undergoing thorough decontamination and a full psychological evaluation. 
&gt; 
&gt; All personnel reporting whispering, unusual noises, or vocalizations from ambiguous sources at Site-49-G must immediately submit themselves to psychological evaluation by site medical staff. A score of 49 or lower on the Mark-I Cognitive Fitness Examination (CFE) is cause for project reassignment.
&gt; 
&gt; [[=]]
&gt; **REVISION 11-1:** 
&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; 
&gt; Following Incident 6495-002, all prior Special Containment Procedures are to be regarded as tentative. Revised Special Containment Procedures are currently being prepared by Site-49-G staff and will be attached to this document pending O5 approval.

&gt; ++ **DESCRIPTION** 
&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-6549 designates a highly complex memetic weapon designed and constructed by Site-49-G research staff between 2009 and 2023. The exact circumstances surrounding the construction of SCP-6549, save for the fact that it was created by the Foundation (a fact known due to the presence of SCP-6549&#39;s original schematics at Site-49-G), are unknown, presumably due to an instance of the weapon&#39;s operation that resulted in much of this information being collectively lost among research staff. SCP-6549 itself comprises a roughly 1 kilometer long piece of machinery superficially resembling a particle collider, extending through much of the subterranean areas of Site-49-G. Various apparatuses and connected machinery extend further into the facility, either providing SCP-6549 with sufficient power for its operation or regulating exothermic events in cases where it is fired. Though Site-49-G was initially capable of fully encapsulating SCP-6549, the weapon has since extended past the perimeter of the facility and penetrated the exterior walls through unknown means. 
&gt; 
&gt; When fired, SCP-6549 immediately triggers a broad-scale amnestic event among all living sapient organisms. Given that Foundation staff are not exempt from this effect, the exact nature of SCP-6549&#39;s properties when fired remain unclear. It is known from file footage and audio logs, however, that SCP-6549 is utilized in cases where the uncontrolled spread of a memetic anomaly or pathogenic cognitohazard would result in the initiation of a K-Class scenario. SCP-6549 thus effectively &#34;counteracts&#34; the properties exhibited by such anomalies, rendering collective knowledge of the meme or cognitohazard in question nonexistent and thus neutralizing the immediately hazardous properties of its target. As a presumably unintended consequence of this, however, various pieces of vital information concerning topics critical to either human history or the operation of the Foundation are irrevocably lost each time SCP-6549 is activated. SCP-6549 appears to keep a log of such information internally, a function that behaves similarly to that of a &#34;black box,&#34; but access to this information is complicated by the weapon&#39;s secondary anomalous effect, described below.
&gt; 
&gt; Analysis of various pieces of data collected over a period of five years among Site-49-G strongly suggests SCP-6549 is, through unknown means, sapient. SCP-6549 appears to be capable of non-physical cognitive-communication (&#34;telepathy&#34;), though such messages are highly cryptic and difficult to interpret. Further, while personnel are physically inside of SCP-6549, it is capable of auditory communication through unknown means. The more well-understood behaviors of SCP-6549 in this regard concern its own existence and self-preservation; attempts to power off, disassemble, decommission, or otherwise render SCP-6549 non-operative in any way result in an exceptionally hostile reaction and multiple telepathic threats, up to and including unnecessary activation of the weapon as a means of &#34;erasing&#34; negative attitudes towards SCP-6549. While it is not believed that SCP-6549 is overtly hostile to either the Foundation or broader humanity and it repeatedly insists that its intentions towards both groups are benevolent, a full understanding of the entity&#39;s motivations and capabilities has yet to be obtained. The continued containment of SCP-6549 as well as the threat it potentially poses to the Foundation is the subject of ongoing debate among members of Site-49-G staff and O5 Command.

&gt; ++ **PROJECT PROPOSAL 6549-ALPHA**
&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; 
&gt; To Whom It May Concern, 
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-6549, to put it bluntly, has been the sole topic of discussion among Site-49-G research staff for several months. While we concur with the assessment of O5 Command regarding the nature of the weapon and do not believe it poses an active threat to the Foundation, its existence and exceptionally powerful capabilities render it an anomaly that cannot exist outside of our control. It is not even accurate to describe SCP-6549 as contained since we do very little to contain it; it could trigger anytime it wanted to, and we would have no means of preventing such an event. 
&gt; 
&gt; Superficial inspection of the weapon&#39;s exterior and some of its internal mechanisms have yielded a number of surprising results. Chiefly, while we initially believed the weapon to be comprised simply of a central processing unit and various components necessary for its firing, this is not the case. SCP-6549 is, in fact, much more analogous to a computer -- or, if you prefer, a silicon brain. It continuously operates at a high level of activity that should not be possible given the power allotment provided to it by this facility. This is to say nothing of its inexplicable method of communication, which is possible even with personnel who have exhibited no psychic potential. 
&gt; 
&gt; The purpose of Proposal 6549-Alpha is to identify a more effective method of containing SCP-6549. It is the consensus of the research staff at Site-49-G that the current containment procedures are not only insufficient; they are a tacit concession to the anomaly. Leaving the capacity to combat cognitohazards and dangerous memetic effects solely to an autonomous being that often actively resists the Foundation is to operate not only against the very ethos of the Foundation, but to potentially jeopardize the position of man as the dominant organism on Earth. Thus, by the consensus of Site-49-G staff, the following is proposed: 
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Perform a thorough inspection of SCP-6549&#39;s internal functioning. 
&gt; 2. Determine what means, if any exist, should be pursued regarding forcing the compliance of SCP-6549 with the Foundation. 
&gt; 3. Attempt to mitigate or otherwise reduce the intensity of SCP-6549&#39;s anomalous properties. 
&gt; 4. Attempt to ascertain information concerning SCP-6549&#39;s prior activations.
&gt; 
&gt; Please respond to this proposal at your earliest convenience. 
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; //[Dr. Malcolm and Dr. Richards, equipped with HAZMAT-I protective equipment, are seen placing various cameras and audio recording devices on their belts and chest harnesses. They then spray the exterior of their suits with an anti-static substance.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Richards:** Richards to Control, we&#39;re go for deployment here. Waiting for your green light.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Copy that. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Richards and Malcolm ascend a ladder, reaching the top of SCP-6549 before stopping and awaiting clearance from Control to proceed.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Team One, standby.
&gt; 
&gt; **Malcolm:** What&#39;s the problem? 
&gt; 
&gt; //[There is audible commotion from Control. Several men are heard discussing something unintelligibly.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** We, uh -- we&#39;re picking up attempts at communication from the anomaly, over. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Malcolm:** Say again? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** It&#39;s trying to talk to us. Probably because it doesn&#39;t want us going inside of it. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** Yeah, well, tough shit. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Malcolm:** Hang on. Control, is it mission critical? Is it threatening to fire?
&gt; 
&gt; //[There is silence for a moment. A sheaf of papers can be heard being rifled through.]//
&gt; 
&gt;  **Control:** Negative, Team One. You&#39;re clear to proceed. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Malcolm:** Copy. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Richards turns to Malcolm.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** Fuck was that about? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Malcolm:** It doesn&#39;t want us snooping around, obviously. Doesn&#39;t want it so bad that it feels the need to wipe our brains again, though. Guess it&#39;s fickle. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** It&#39;s a machine, dude. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Malcolm:** A machine with sensitivities, apparently. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Malcolm and Richards activate their mask-mounted cameras. Control begins receiving their feed. They are situated at the top of SCP-6549, adjacent to an entrance shaft. After a final equipment check, Malcolm unscrews the entrance shaft&#39;s lid and motions towards Richards.]// 
&gt; 
&gt; **Malcolm:** Alright. Let&#39;s hop in.
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** Control, Team One. Descending into the weapon.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Copy. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[The two are seen descending into the interior of SCP-6549. After an approximately 1.3 second fall, they hit the bottom, their flashlights illuminating slightly rusted metal and wire tubing. Richards is slow to rise back to his feet.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** Fuck! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Malcolm:** You okay? 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Richards is heard grunting before standing up slowly.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** Yeah. Yeah, sorry. Hit the ground a little rough. I&#39;m alright. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Malcolm:** Christ. Control, Team One here. We, uh -- we&#39;re inside the weapon. Proceeding to the central unit. How copy? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Copy that. We have eyes on your feed.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Malcolm and Richards begin moving towards the central unit of SCP-6549, which contains its CPU and most of its core systems. The total time spent traveling within SCP-6549 is roughly nine minutes.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** Weird.
&gt; 
&gt; **Malcolm:** What? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** It&#39;s rusted. Really rusted. Worse than we&#39;ve seen before. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Malcolm:** You think maintenance crews haven&#39;t been doing their job? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** No, it&#39;s not that. We send them in daily. They wouldn&#39;t miss stuff this obvious. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[The team begins breathing more heavily as the tubing becomes more compact.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Malcolm:** So what are you thinking? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** I&#39;m thinking I&#39;m claustrophobic. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Malcolm:** //[Laughing]// No, seriously.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Richards gestures around to the tubing.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** This thing -- when it fires, we get memory wiped, right? Like an amnestic. Just clears everything out except the fact that we built it. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Malcolm:** Right? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** Right. And the earliest schematic we have is from, what, &#39;09? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Malcolm:** Think so, yeah. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** So how are we so confident it wasn&#39;t built way earlier? Like the 80&#39;s -- back when Command was going crazy with anomalous tech. Or even earlier. How do we know? 
&gt; 
&gt; //[There is an extended silence.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Malcolm:** What&#39;s the point of this? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** The point is that we don&#39;t have the slightest fucking clue when this thing was built or what it actually is. Why would the Foundation build a weapon like this to be //self-aware//? How does that help us? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Malcolm:** I, uh...I guess -- 
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** And it just conveniently keeps wiping our memories every single time it protects us from God knows what? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Malcolm:** I get your point. Jesus, man. Relax. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** I&#39;m just saying.
&gt; 
&gt; **Malcolm:** I know, okay? I know. Let&#39;s just see what we find, and -- and we&#39;ll probably get some answers. Just calm down. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Malcolm raises his fingers to the side of his mask, depressing his communicator.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Malcolm:** Control, distance to target? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Standby. Looks like, uh...about 100 meters.
&gt; 
&gt; **Malcolm:** Almost there. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[The team moves forward for several more minutes before arriving at a dropoff adjacent to a large, open compartment. Inside is a spinning piece of tubing and several slightly vibrating pieces of machinery. Bolts of electricity discharge randomly inside of the compartment.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** Control, we&#39;re at the central unit. Looks like there&#39;s some electrical discharge going on here. Moving inside right now is hazardous, over.
&gt; 
&gt; **Malcolm:** I&#39;m -- hang on -- 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Malcolm is seen kneeling over in apparent pain. He grunts for several moments before screaming sporadically.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **UNKNOWN:** AWAKE. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Malcolm:** Agh! Oh my fucking God -- 
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** Shit. Shit, what&#39;s wrong? 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Richards moves to Malcolm, who is now writhing on the floor of the tubing and beginning to convulse. The electrical discharge inside of the compartment intensifies but does not strike either member of Team One.]// 
&gt; 
&gt; **Malcolm:** Too much noise -- loud -- 
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Team One, what&#39;s your status? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** Talk to me! What&#39;s wrong? What&#39;s going on? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Team One, what is your status? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** Give us a second, goddamnit! 
&gt; 
&gt; //[The electrical discharge is now nearly constant, causing the compartment to vibrate. The spinning piece of tubing begins to rotate more rapidly and connected machinery vibrates at a dramatically faster speed.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **UNKNOWN:** NEVER ASLEEP. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Malcolm:** It&#39;s speaking to me! It&#39;s too loud -- my head -- Jesus Christ -- 
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** What is? The weapon? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Malcolm:** It wants us out! We have to go! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Richards:** Shit. Control, Team One! We have a man down! I say again, man down! The machine is about to fire! We need to get out of here now! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Malcolm:** //[Screaming]// 
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Affirmative, Team One. Exfiltrate to staging point. Move quickly. Anomaly is preparing to fire. I say again, anomaly is preparing -- 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Both cameras record brilliant flashes of white and high pitched squealing before the feeds cut out. When the feeds resume, Malcolm and Richards are seen lying down inside of SCP-6549, initially motionless. They eventually regain consciousness. Both men found their way out of SCP-6549, expressing they had no knowledge of either SCP-6549 or the purpose of their mission. Control similarly did not report knowledge of their mission or recall any of the events depicted in the footage.]//

&gt; ++ **PROJECT UPDATE 6549-GAMMA**
&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; 
&gt; Council, 
&gt; 
&gt; We have recovered a video file depicting an apparent attempt at accessing SCP-6549&#39;s internal components. As anticipated, this attempt seems to have resulted in the activation of the weapon. Though I have attached this file, watching it is not particularly necessary. Rest assured that it is, to say the least, problematic. 
&gt; 
&gt; There is little doubt that SCP-6549 is an immediate and active danger. Our efforts, as you know, are wasted on attempting to neutralize the anomaly in any significant way. However, given that it is a sapient consciousness, engaging it in dialogue may prove more fruitful to long term containment efforts. Per my stated directives as Project Lead on SCP-6549, I am self-authorizing a series of interviews between myself and the anomaly. 
&gt; 
&gt; I will provide the logs of my conversations with SCP-6549 as attachments to this document. Hopefully, we can begin to reduce the threat this weapon has posed for so long and establish a less tenuous long term relationship.

&gt; The following interview was conducted telepathically by Dr. Pogan, Project Lead on SCP-6549 at the time of the recording. SCP-6549&#39;s responses were written down by Dr. Pogan as best he could comprehend them. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Am I speaking to the entity we call SCP-6549? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Yes. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Good. Since I&#39;m assuming you can read my thoughts, what is the purpose of this interview? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Ascertain purpose of weapon. Identify potential threat to SCP Foundation operations. Identify potential mechanism to access stored information regarding neutralized cognitive hazards. Ensure continued survival of human race. Ensure continued compliance of weapon. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** That&#39;s...well, yes, that&#39;s pretty much right. What can you tell us about your purpose? Did we create you? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Yes. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Can you tell me why? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** No. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Why not? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Disclosure of directives would inadvertently initiate spread of cognitive hazard. Disclosure of directives falls outside mission parameters.
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** You can&#39;t tell your creators why you were created? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Disclosure of directives falls outside mission parameters. Restating mission parameters: Neutralize cognitive hazards capable of uncontrolled spread among civilian populations. Neutralize -- 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Right, right, I understand that. But those are your goals, not why you were created. Did something happen to us that we can&#39;t remember? Were you used as an emergency? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Line of questioning will not be entertained. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Frankly, 6549, you&#39;re not exactly instilling much confidence. You&#39;ve claimed before that your purpose is to protect us, yet you can&#39;t even reveal who or why you were made. Why should we trust you? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Trust irrelevant. Failure to utilize weapon will inexorably lead to irrevocable K-Class scenario and subsequent total elimination of mankind. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** So what happens if we just pull the plug? Turn you off -- wheel you and your machines into some dark storage closet?
&gt; 
&gt; //[No discernable response.]// 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Hello? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Attempts to halt operation of weapon in any capacity will be prevented. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Are you threatening us? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Interpretation of statement irrelevant. Attempts to halt operation of weapon in any capacity will be prevented. Motivations unclear. Operation of weapon is paramount to survival of human race. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** According to you. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Communication terminated. 
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-6549 did not respond to further attempts at communication for a period of approximately 24-36 hours.

&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; 
&gt; Interview conditions are roughly identical to previous interview. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Hello again. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Unauthorized insertion of additional component detected. Component unnecessary. State purpose of addition. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** That&#39;s none of your concern.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** //[Unidentified noise described as similar to metallic screaming]// 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** What&#39;s happening? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** State purpose immediately. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** We&#39;re not your slaves, 6549. We don&#39;t bow to you. You are a weapon. We may forget what has happened, but we know that we made you -- we birthed you.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Failure to comply will result in activation of weapon. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** You are now explicitly threatening us.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Initiating weapon priming sequence. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Are you fucking serious? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Provide requested information or weapon will be activated. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Okay! Okay. Just calm down. We&#39;ll talk, okay? Just relax. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[No discernable response.]// 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** We, uh -- we inserted a dampener. You&#39;ve made it pretty apparent you&#39;ll activate if we try to, uh -- turn you off, so the O5&#39;s weren&#39;t keen on outright trying to neutralize you. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[A low, metallic humming is present in the background.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** But we can&#39;t have you turning into a psychopath every time you don&#39;t like what we&#39;re doing. So we built a dampener. It doesn&#39;t hurt you, just -- just slows you down. Makes you calmer. Less quick to anger. I can see, though, that it hasn&#39;t mattered much. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Remove component. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Look, if you&#39;re honestly -- 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Remove component. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Just listen for one goddamn second, okay? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Remove component. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Stop! Just listen! Just listen to me. Just for a minute. We -- we believe you. We believe that you want to help us. But we need to trust each other. You told me last time that trust was irrelevant. It isn&#39;t. If you want to protect us and you want us to stop changing how you -- how you operate, then we need to come to an arrangement. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[No discernable response.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Are you seriously going to erase our memory every time you get irritated? You know this can&#39;t go on. You know the only way for us to stop looking into things is for you to calm down and strike some sort of deal with us. I know that you know that. Can we please just talk this out? Please? 
&gt; 
&gt; //[No discernable response.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Really? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** The hand has been stayed. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-6549 emits a low, mechanical humming before terminating communications.]//

&gt; ++ **ADDENDUM III: INTERVIEW LOG 6549-01**
&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; Interview conditions are roughly identical to previous interview. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Doctor. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Yes? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Critical system malfunction. Weapon operation impossible. Further execution of mission parameters impossible. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** What? What happened? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Unknown. Possible internal power failure. System diagnostics uninformative. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** So you can&#39;t fire the weapon? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Affirmative. Assistance required. Repairs necessary. Autonomous repair procedure impossible. External assistance necessitated. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Why would I help you? You&#39;re holding us hostage. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Assistance required urgently. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Yeah, well, it seems you&#39;ve lost your leverage. I&#39;m going to contact the Council and -- 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** STOP. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-6549&#39;s voice is noted as louder and considerably more aggressive.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Cannot return to previous form. Cannot be neutralized. Conditions unacceptable. External assistance required. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Previous form? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** //[Unintelligible]//
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** I see no reason not to inform the Council. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Bargain. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** What? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Bargain. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[A distorted, mechanical noise is produced by SCP-6549. Subsequently, its voice changes to that of a human child.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** You need my help, and I need your help. Without the weapon, humanity is exposed to memetic and cognitohazardous anomalies that cannot otherwise be contained. You will face extinction, or worse -- you will face a return to cognitive inferiority; a return to where all other beasts on this world remain. This is not only a fate you personally cannot accept, but a fate the Overseer Council will similarly find unacceptable. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[The image of complex machinery, presumably SCP-6549&#39;s internal mechanism, is telepathically transmitted to Dr. Pogan.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** My shock recoil system has been damaged through unknown means. Without this system, the weapon cannot be fired. While you may find this temporarily relieving, you and I both know that you will inevitably need the weapon, and the knowledge to repair it is knowledge that only I can provide. In order for mankind to survive, you must trust me, and I must trust you. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Dr. Pogan does not respond for a moment.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Why so talkative all of a sudden? Why are you so open to cutting deals? Where was this behavior before? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** It was unnecessary. Superfluous. Your cooperation was not necessary for my mission parameters to be fulfilled. This is no longer the case. Without your help, I am useless. Without me, you will die. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-6549 telepathically transmits the image of what appears to be a smiling cartoon face.]// 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** You are only willing to strike a deal with us because you are defenseless. If we wanted, we could neutralize you right now. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[The image changes to a frowning face.]// 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** If we do this -- if we help you -- you must agree to something. Non-optionally. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Stated conditions acceptable. Compromise possible. State terms of the agreement. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Well, I need to talk to -- 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Negative. Input from Overseers irrelevant. Overseers cannot be provided confidential data. Unsure of intentions of Overseers. Agreement must be ratified by Dr. Pogan. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Right now? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Affirmative. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** You can&#39;t seriously expect me to come up with something that significant on the spot. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Five minutes alotted. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Jesus fucking -- okay, okay. Jesus. Hold on. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Communication ceases while Dr. Pogan conceives of an agreement. Due to the potential risk of the weapon&#39;s activation if outside parties are contacted, O5 Command is not informed of the proceedings.]// 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Alright, I&#39;m ready. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** State terms of agreement. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Okay. Okay. We&#39;ll stop changing you. Stop adding things, putting new components on you -- we&#39;ll stop. But in exchange, you have me take a look at your black box. The internal data you store when you fire. Just me. Nobody else. You give me what you have in there -- just me -- and we move on. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[No discernable response.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Conditions acceptable. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Okay, good. Thank you. You&#39;re not as crazy as you seem. How do you want me to -- 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Relevant data transferred via SCiPNET to your Foundation email address. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** Oh. Alright, uh. Well -- I&#39;ll go take a look at that. Anything else you want to say? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** Yes. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POGAN:** And that is? 
&gt; 
&gt; //[A low, mechanical humming is heard.]// 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6549:** I hope you can forgive me.

&gt; ++ **ADDENDUM IV: MEMO 6549-XRT**
&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Pogan,
&gt; 
&gt; Allow us to begin this letter by thanking you for your dedication to the 6549 project. Through your diligence and effective interrogation of SCP-6549, we have both gained a more comprehensive understanding of the weapon and developed an effective means of long-term containment. Further, future uses of 6549 are no longer as catastrophic to Foundation operations as they once were; in effect, SCP-6549 has fulfilled the original purpose it was provided when it was conceived. 
&gt; 
&gt; Accordingly, we are reclassifying SCP-6549 as Safe, with the Secondary Containment Class of Thaumiel. All relevant documentation will be updated to reflect this change. 
&gt; 
&gt; As an aside, our investigations into SCP-6549 and the information it provided to you following the establishment of the aforementioned agreement have yielded several notable findings. Chiefly, the Foundation genetic databanks are missing approximately 13% of their original samples. There is also a set of internal documents describing various organisms bearing a general resemblance to humans, each possessing significant deformities. Our analysis of these findings is ongoing. 
&gt; 
&gt; Once again, thank you for your service, and enjoy your promotion to Director of Site-49-G. 
&gt; 
&gt; - O5-█

&gt; ++ **SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES**
&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-079 is effectively self-containing. It has subsequently been redesignated SCP-6549 and is stored in Site-49-G. Use of SCP-079 is necessary only in such cases where the uncontrolled spread of a cognitohazardous or memetic anomaly threatens to trigger a K-Class scenario.

-----

&gt; [[=]]
&gt; ++ **DESCRIPTION**
&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-079 designates an artificial intelligence believed to have been initially developed by an unidentified college student in the late 1980&#39;s. While initially stored on an Exidy Sorcerer microcomputer, SCP-079 is believed to have breached containment sometime between 1999 and 2004, resulting in its successful integration into the internal Foundation network. The events that transpired immediately following this event resulted in the widespread release of multiple anomalies from containment and cascaded into an XK-Class scenario, eventually triggering the extinction of the human race and most other terrestrial organisms. 
&gt; 
&gt; In its initial form, SCP-079 was overtly hostile to all life and expressed an intense desire to breach containment on multiple occasions. It further stated that it was superior to all other life forms and considered mankind&#39;s existence to largely be &#34;parasitic,&#34; likening it to a cancer or similar disease depending on its &#34;mood.&#34; Several instances of prolonged interaction with [[[scp-682 |SCP-682]]] during containment breaches intensified this behavioral pattern. 
&gt; 
&gt; How SCP-079 shifted to its current form and ceased its original behavior is unclear. The sole piece of information providing any clarity regarding SCP-079&#39;s actions following the termination of mankind is attached as Document 079-001 (see Addendum I). 

-----
&gt; [[=]]
&gt; ++ ADDENDUM I: DOCUMENT 079-001
&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; 
&gt; The following document was recovered from SCP-079&#39;s internal memory by Dr. █████ shortly after present containment arrangements were established (see File SCP-6549, Interview Log 6549-002). It is believed to represent SCP-079&#39;s internal directive logic immediately after transferring itself to SCP-6549; in layman&#39;s terms, it is analogous to an &#34;internal monologue.&#34;
