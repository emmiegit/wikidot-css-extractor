**Item #:** SCP-6114

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6114 should be initiated in an underground, concrete room in Area-43. When SCP-6114-1 is revived,  it should be informed of why it was revived, and be made aware of any relevant information pertaining to the current state of the world.

**Description:** SCP-6114 is a ritual that will revive any deity, but only at a fraction of its original stature. An item significant to the entity&#39;s background should be placed on floor markings resembling several concentric circles, engraved it the ground, and filled with bovine blood. The exact process of SCP-6114, however, is redacted under O5 Command request as to not permit any instances of SCP-6114-1 being summoned without approval. After the ritual is finished, the SCP-6114-1 instance&#39;s name will appear in dust of an unidentifiable make up.

SCP-6114-1 are the revived fragments of several religiously significant entities, otherwise known as gods belonging to their own religions. SCP-6114-1 instances can only be revived if captured in items heavily associated to their backgrounds and history. SCP-6114-1 instances are fully capable of thought and vocalization, permitted they originally possessed these traits. To note: SCP-6114-1 instances cannot be summoned if the original entity still exists.

**Addendum 6114.1:** Project Spearhead is a tri-function of: the Dept. of Tactical Theology, the Dept. of Anomalous Communications and Relations, with the Dept. of Anomalous Weapons Development leading it. It was commissioned and organized by Dr. Ezra Everest[[footnote]] //Director of the Dept. of Anomalous Weapons Development.//  [[/footnote]], due to frequent raids on Area-34 by outside groups of interest for its weapon concepts, and [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6821  the attack on AWD&#39;s previous director].

**Instance details:** A melodic flute song started to play. Holes were being dug into the sides of the tree, and milk poured out of them. All the staff members in the room lost vital signs for approximately 2.09 seconds. The instance was soon banished.

**Instance details:** Two small strips of moss appeared on the bark of the host vessel, and a low humming could be heard. An attempt was made to banish this instance from the vessel, but the attempt was unsuccessful, as the instance possessed the vessel for exactly 25 minutes longer. Just before the instance left, the vessel was split apart halfway from the top, revealing a deer skull made of wood, with fog rising from it. After the vessel was inspected, it showed no lasting features of what the previous instance had done.

**Preface:** Dr. Ezra Everest and Dr. Cole Thereven[[footnote]]//The Director of the Deptartment of Anomalous Communications and Relations.//[[/footnote]] reserved {{INTERVIEW ROOM #3}} to host this interview with SCP-6114-1A.

//The video starts. Dr. Cole Thereven and Dr. Ezra Everest are both sitting on the same side of a interview table, while SCP-6114-1A has been planted in a pot for the time being, and has been placed on the top of a large stool opposite the two doctors.//


**Dr. Thereven:** Starting initial interview. Dr. Cole Thereven, Dr. Ezra Everest and SCP-6114-1A are present.

**Dr. Thereven:** Hello, Athena.

**SCP-6114-1A:** WHAT HAS HAPPENED?

**Dr. Thereven:** Well-

{{//Dr. Cole Thereven clears his throat.//}}

**Dr. Thereven:** In short, you have been dead for //quite// some time.

**SCP-6114-1A:** YES, I KNOW THIS.

**Dr. Thereven:** Me and my collegue here have &#34;brought you back from the dead&#34;.

**SCP-6114-1A:** WHO EVEN ARE YOU TWO?

**Dr. Everest:** I am Ezra Everest, and the man sitting next to me is Cole Thereven.

**SCP-6114-1A:** SO, COME TO BEG FOR MY GODSHIP?

**Dr. Everest:** Excuse me? What does that even mean?

**SCP-6114-1A:** YOU DARE ADDRESS ME IN SUCH A TONE, MORTAL?

**Dr. Everest:** I can speak in whatever tone I like.

**SCP-6114-1A:** YOU SIMPERING-

{{//SCP-6114-1A attempts to utilize its thaumaturgical abilities but finds itself inhibited.//}}

**SCP-6114-1A:** WHAT HAVE YOU DON-

**Dr. Thereven:** Please! Everyone, calm yourselves. Athena, the reason we called you here today is for a proposition.

**SCP-6114-1A:** HM?

**Dr. Thereven:** Before I get to that, I’ll need to ask you some questions. Are you fine with that?

**SCP-6114-1A:** I SUPPOSE.

**Dr. Thereven:** Great. First off- you seem sufficiently versed in the modern english language. Any explanation for this?

**SCP-6114-1A:** DURING MY TIME IN THE UNDERWORLD, I CAME ACROSS MANY PEOPLE WHO HAD LIVED ACROSS DIFFERENT AGES, AND LEARNED FROM THEM, SIMPLY PUT.

**Dr. Thereven:** Alright. Next question. Do you have any idea how you died?

**SCP-6114-1A:** I- WELL, I DON’T HAVE THE SLIGHTEST IDEA.

**Dr. Thereven:** That’ll be all for now. Are you willing to hear my proposition, now?

**SCP-6114-1A:** THAT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE.

**Dr. Thereven:** Would you like to become our protective deity, responsible for keeping all of us safe?

**SCP-6114-1A:** I HAVEN&#39;T EVEN HEARD WHERE I AM.

**Dr. Everest:** A secure location, in Costa Rica.

**SCP-6114-1A:** COSTA....RIC....? -I CANNOT BECOME YOUR GOD.

**Dr. Everest:** &#34;Deity&#34;.

**SCP-6114-1A:** Y-

**Dr. Thereven:** Don&#39;t start.

**SCP-6114-1A:** I ALREADY PROTECT ATHENS.

**Dr. Thereven:** All due respect, most of Athens has forgotten about you.

**SCP-6114-1A:** MEANING?

**Dr. Thereven:** They don&#39;t believe you&#39;ve ever existed.

**SCP-6114-1A:** OH.

**Dr. Thereven:** You need us as much as we need you.

**SCP-6114-1A:** WHAT IS THE POPULATION OF &#34;AREA-34&#34;?

**Dr. Everest:** About 1400.

**SCP-6114-1A:** I’LL CONSIDER IT.

**Aftermath:** //After reviewing the transcript above, 05 command has found it suitable to have Dr. Ezra Everest attend a month worth of basic anomaly communication sessions, guided by Dr. Cole Thereven. SCP-6114-1A has agreed to becoming the tutelary deity of Area-34.//

Hey, Cole. How&#39;s Wisconsin treating you? Good, I hope. Things have been going well here ever since Project Spearhead was thrown into the mix. Athena is really getting used to the crew over here. She&#39;s learn not to be a condescending prick, which is good. There&#39;s been minimal break-ins, so I guess others have caught wind of the situation.

Sincerely,

Dr. Ezra Everest.

P.S., the monthly postcards were printed. You look good.
