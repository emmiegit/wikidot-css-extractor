[BEGIN LOG]

**Granite:** Mic check.

**Basalt:** Check.

**Pumice:** Check.

**Slate:** Check.

**Granite:** Alright, proceed.

//The team descends into SCP-6431.//

//Houses with varying architecture span throughout SCP-6431. The space appears open. A sunrise is visible, giving SCP-6431 a red tint.//

//Pieces of trash are scattered across the ground. Multiple roads fork off from the entry point, and pieces of furniture sit on the sidewalks.//

**Pumice:** The fuck? Why&#39;s it so red in here?

**Slate:** I don&#39;t think we&#39;re inside.

//Slate gestures upwards.//

**Basalt:** Weird-ass neighborhood.

**Slate:** No kidding. What&#39;s with the furniture everywhere?

**Basalt:** The furniture? What about the houses?

**Granite:** I mean, it&#39;s a space under New Orleans. Isn&#39;t that already weird?

**Pumice:** Why&#39;s that weird?

**Granite:** You really don&#39;t know?

**Pumice:** Oh, right, water...

//A slight breeze pushes a cup across the street.//

**Granite:** Let&#39;s get going.

//The team proceeds along the left road for approximately 21 minutes. Various houses of no discernible pattern line both sides. The road branches after every 4-8 houses.//

//The sound of a closing door is heard, causing Basalt, Pumice, and Slate to stop. Several vaguely humanoid figures briefly appear in the windows of the surrounding houses.//

//Slate looks around.//

**Slate:** Where&#39;d that come from?

**Pumice:** I don&#39;t think we&#39;re alone.

**Basalt:** Let&#39;s investigate. What do you say, Granite?

**Basalt:** Granite?

**Pumice:** Shit, he&#39;s still moving.

//Basalt, Slate, and Pumice run to catch up with Granite.//

**Basalt:** You good?

//A pause.//

**Basalt:** Granite, are you alright?

**Granite:** Oh, yeah, I&#39;m fine.

**Basalt:** And you&#39;ll tell us if something&#39;s wrong.

**Granite:** Mhm...

//The team continues walking for ten minutes. Granite turns on multiple roads before stopping. and turning around.//

**Granite:** Hey, why do you guys keep following me?

**Pumice:** You&#39;re the team leader.

**Granite:** What&#39;re you talking about? Team?

**Pumice:** Y&#39;know, the exploration?

**Granite:** Just- stay away. Stop following me.

**Slate:** You-

**Granite:** Go!

//Basalt looks around.//

**Slate:** What do we do now?

**Basalt:** Let&#39;s go... right.

//The team, with the exception of Granite, turns to the right and continues walking.//

**Slate:** We&#39;re not seriously gonna leave him, are we?

**Basalt:** No. We&#39;ll turn on the next block. 

//The team takes the next turn and walks for six minutes.//

//Basalt holds her head.//

**Slate:** You okay?

**Basalt:** Yeah, just kinda dizzy...

**Slate:** Why don&#39;t we take a break?

**Basalt:** No, we&#39;re almost there.

**Slate:** You heard from Granite?

//Silence.//

**Slate:** Basalt, did you hear from Granite?

**Pumice:** I don&#39;t think that&#39;s it.

**Slate:** No shit, Sherlock.

**Pumice:** No, I mean-

//An unidentified female voice cuts in.//

**Female:** Where have you been? I told you to be back before dinner.

**Granite:** I was out with some friends.

**Slate:** The fuck?

**Female:** I was worried about you.

**Granite:** Sorry, Mom.

**Pumice:** Granite, you okay there?

**Female:** Come on, let&#39;s get you cleaned up.

**Pumice:** Granite, come in.

//Silence.//

**Slate:** Granite?

**Pumice:** We lost him.

//A pause.//

**Slate:** Basalt, where are you taking us?

//A pause.//

**Slate:** Basalt, where are you going?

**Pumice:** Let&#39;s just follow her.

//The team continues walking for five minutes before Basalt stops and stares up at a house.//

**Slate:** I... I don&#39;t like this.

//A vaguely humanoid figure briefly appears in a window before moving out of sight.//

**Pumice:** Did you see that?

//Basalt begins to walk towards the house.//

**Pumice:** Oh, no, you don&#39;t!

//Pumice forces Basalt to the ground.//

**Pumice:** What&#39;s gotten into you?

**Basalt:** Who- who are you? What do you want?

**Pumice:** Basalt?

//Pumice&#39;s hands begin to sink through Basalt.//

//Basalt stands up, leaving Pumice on the ground.//

**Slate:** Oh god.

//Basalt tilts her head slightly before removing her headset.//

//She opens the door and walks inside.//

**Pumice:** Shit.

**Slate:** What now?

**Pumice:** Head back before it happens to us.

**Slate:** I... guess.

//Pumice turns.//

**Slate:** They&#39;re gone, aren&#39;t they?

**Pumice:** Probably.

//Pumice and Slate walk silently for ten minutes.//

**Pumice:** Hey, Slate?

**Slate:** Hm?

**Pumice:** What was your family like?

**Slate:** Why do you ask?

**Pumice:** I think... I understand now.

**Slate:** Understand what? What&#39;re you talking about?

**Pumice:** I just wanna know.

//A pause.//

**Slate:** I didn&#39;t have one.

**Pumice:** Well, you&#39;re lucky, I guess.

**Slate:** Lucky? How is that lucky?

**Pumice:** You&#39;ll understand eventually.

**Pumice:** I think I&#39;m gonna go home now.

**Slate:** You&#39;re not making any sense.

//Pumice turns to the left. Slate follows.//

**Slate:** Pumice, where are you going? This isn&#39;t the right way.

**Pumice:** I told you: I&#39;m going home.

//Slate grabs Pumice&#39;s wrist and attempts to pull him in the opposite direction. He continues walking, pulling Slate along slowly.//

**Slate:** You&#39;re coming back with me. Come on!

**Pumice:** It&#39;ll be over soon.

**Slate:** Yeah, because we&#39;re going back up! Snap out of it already!

//Pumice&#39;s wrist passes through Slate&#39;s hands, causing her to stumble.//

**Pumice:** You need to leave.

**Slate:** I&#39;m not gonna lose you, too!

**Pumice:** You&#39;ve already...

//Pumice stops and walks into a house. Slate follows him inside.//

//The camera feed cuts out.//

//Two unidentified voices begin to speak.//

//Slate breathes heavily.//

**Child A:** Nate! You&#39;re back!

**Pumice:** Hey, Syd.

**Slate:** Pumice, whatever that thing is...

**Child B:** Look, look, my tooth fell out!

**Pumice:** Don&#39;t forget to put that under your pillow.

**Slate:** Get- get away from it!

//Slate screams.//

//The camera feed begins again, showing Slate running from the house. She continues running towards the entry point for 32 minutes.//

[END LOG]

**Concluding Statement:** Slate was successfully extracted following the mission; however, she refused to speak about the events that occurred inside the house. Of note, the sun did not move from its initial position during the exploration.
