我們稱這個版面為 **解密**。 他們包含了&#34;SparkNotes&#34;風格的文章摘要，並對劇情元素或符號的象徵意義進行解析。我們從故事、知識、與基金會的世界觀的聯繫，與我們自己的推斷，將其組成一份專業、有趣且詳盡、引人入勝的解密。

我們的子板塊是一個歌頌並分析這些年發表在SCP基金會網站上且具有宏偉故事深度的內容中心。我們會展開定期的**[[span class=&#34;ruby&#34;]]向作者提問[[span class=&#34;rt&#34;]]Ask An Author[[/span]][[/span]]** 功能，這給予SCP作者一個平台，能夠讓評論者詢問他們想要知道的進度問題、作品的解釋問題或是他們對基金會帶來的貢獻問題。同時SCP解密中心頁的**[[span class=&#34;ruby&#34;]]知識大全[[span class=&#34;rt&#34;]]Lore Overviews[[/span]][[/span]]**是有用於幫助深度的討論文章，他們探討了SCP宇宙的一隅，不管是76年班、欲肉教的歷史、相嘯魔，還是SCP基金會的近代介紹。

[https://redd.it/at3uoj SCP-173 - The Sculpture - The Original]
&gt; //It was written to convey a setting, a world in which the abnormal is not only reality, but commonplace. The actual object was just a narrative vehicle for that.//

[https://redd.it/6rwzcq SCP-184 - The Architect]

[https://redd.it/71vz8e SCP-1173 - The Islamic Republic of Eastern Samothrace]
&gt; //The other side claims that the memetic agent removes the memory that this country exists, that it is an actual place, and that the people from this country are experiencing severe persecution, bordering on genocide, due to the memetic agent preventing the world from acknowledging that they exist.//
&gt;
&gt; //And we have no way of knowing which is true.//

[https://redd.it/6y27ab SCP-1272 - Slow Motion Catastrophe]
&gt; //Mr. Blue Man is moving at over 400 million kilometers per hour. This is why they&#39;ve been sending teams in to stop the first group. If the first teams move the statues and stop the anomaly, Mr. Blue Man will still be moving that fast when he leaves.//

**[https://redd.it/a8lyg9 SCP-2140 - Retroconverter]**

&gt; //The real twist is that SCP-2317 isn&#39;t the door, but the entity contained within: &#34;The ████, Devourer of Worlds&#34;. We also learn that Calabasas is - get this - useless. It doesn&#39;t do anything.//

&gt; //Worse, it seems that the core is containing Omega, and if that containment were ever to break, the reversed entropy would spread across the entire universe, reversing time back to the Big Bang. It&#39;s set to do just that, breaking its own containment in 2234.//

**[https://redd.it/6i9gsl SCP-2719 - Inside]**
&gt; //Someone tries to make intestinal distress Inside Dr. Bright, but for some reason it doesn&#39;t work. The pointer tries to access the location in memory of Intestinal Distress; it&#39;s Outside, and no longer under the pointer&#39;s influence. Whatever the case, Dr. Bright assigns the pointer to Intestinal Distress, puts the doctor Inside it.//

**[https://redd.it/7h14jz SCP-2740 - It Wasn&#39;t There]**
&gt; //This SCP can&#39;t really be understood in-universe, and that&#39;s kind of the point. That nightmare most of us have had: running from something, some unknowable fear, the one Olivia references? This is that bundled with family tragedy and domestic violence.//

**[https://redd.it/7hd2uf SCP-2747 - As below, so above]**
&gt; //Hell, by studying the anafabula so heavily, the Foundation has accelerated its own destruction by giving it so many opportunities to enter their universe, and by creating one in the layer just beneath them.//

&gt; //And sadly, the plan of keeping her safe by building her a human body is completely ruined by the Foundation’s existence. The moment the body is finished and she’s able to move with it, the Foundation will either destroy her or lock her up in a dark cell for all time.//

&gt; //It&#39;s a cave - a Keter cave. The most dangerous and hard-to-contain, unpredictable cave ever, apparently.//

**[https://redd.it/6onfkk SCP-2943 - In Case Of Emergency, Break Glass]**
&gt; //SCP-2943 is like the time version of SCP-2000. It&#39;s a way to save and load; a real-life quicksave. It&#39;s the best power, the one thing that was beyond the Foundation, delivered perfectly into their hands.//

**[https://redd.it/74g9vr SCP Foundation Glossary]**
&gt; //SPC (No, that&#39;s not a misspelling)//
&gt; //acronym//
&gt; //Shark Punching Center. Originated as a backronym to make fun of the frequent misspelling of SCP. Became its own quasi-canon/alternate universe, but is considerably more tongue-in-cheek than other canons.//

&gt; //In 2007, a single creepypasta on a fast-moving 4chan board caught a few people&#39;s attention. Today, it&#39;s grown to become one of the most prominent and impactful science fiction franchises of the early 21st century. A universe awaits. Are you ready to begin?//

&gt; //Yaldabaoth represented aspects of chaos, flesh and beastiality, barely sentient and content to create and consume.

**[https://redd.it/8jwbug Dr. Wondertainment]** (video)
&gt; //Dr. Wondertainment may be a company, it may be an individual, it may be an individual that runs a company. Most important, however, is that Dr. Wondertainment is magical, and they make toys.//

**[https://redd.it/7xzp80 Class of &#39;76]**
