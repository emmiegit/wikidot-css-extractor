[[span style=&#34;color: black;&#34;]]The stories and articles found throughout the SCP wiki can be breathtaking and multilayered, but also complexly hidden between the lines. Even after repeated readthroughs and laconic explanations, sometimes you still don&#39;t get the full picture - the context, the nuanced meanings, or the greater story behind everything. The r/SCPDeclassified subreddit is here to help you out and enrich your reading experience by offering clear and readable walkthroughs and essays that delve deep into these multifaceted pieces.

We call our explanation posts declassifications. They incorporate a SparkNotes-style summary of the article, along with heavy analysis of the meaning of their plot elements or symbols. We incorporate quotes from the story, knowledge and links with all of Foundation lore, and our own educated speculation about how it all fits together to create a professionally-written, engaging, and exhaustive declassification.

Our subreddit is a hub of content that celebrates and analyzes the great depth of story that the SCP community has created over the years. We host periodic Ask An Author features, which allow SCP authors a platform for commenters to ask questions about their writing process, any part of their work, and their contributions to the wiki as a whole. In addition, SCPDeclassified&#39;s Lore Overviews are helpful and in-depth essays that explore one part of the SCP universe, whether that be the Class of &#39;76, the History of Sarkicism, Pattern Screamers, or a Modern Introduction to the SCP Foundation.

&gt; //From the ashes, a fire shall be woken,//
&gt; //A light from the shadows shall spring;//

[https://redd.it/at3uoj SCP-173 - The Sculpture - The Original]
&gt; //It was written to convey a setting, a world in which the abnormal is not only reality, but commonplace. The actual object was just a narrative vehicle for that.//

&gt; //The Administrator then asks the question again. What is the best way to hide SCP-001, the maker of the universe?//
&gt; 
&gt; //Make it SCP-184.//

[https://redd.it/6cgl2o SCP-256 - Trapped in the Typewriter]
&gt; //Four civilians are allowed access to 256, and they are recorded as being romantically involved with or related to SCP-256. What? It&#39;s a typewriter!//

&gt; //Why sex offender, all of the sudden? Does this have a hidden meaning? (Of course it does, that&#39;s why I mentioned it.)//

[https://redd.it/71vz8e SCP-1173 - The Islamic Republic of Eastern Samothrace]
&gt; //The other side claims that the memetic agent removes the memory that this country exists, that it is an actual place, and that the people from this country are experiencing severe persecution, bordering on genocide, due to the memetic agent preventing the world from acknowledging that they exist.//
&gt; 
&gt; //And we have no way of knowing which is true.//

[https://redd.it/6y27ab SCP-1272 - Slow Motion Catastrophe]
&gt; //Mr. Blue Man is moving at over 400 million kilometers per hour. This is why they&#39;ve been sending teams in to stop the first group. If the first teams move the statues and stop the anomaly, Mr. Blue Man will still be moving that fast when he leaves.//

&gt; //The ideas are leaking.//

&gt; //And in order to keep a constant supply of oppressed people, the Foundation engages in propping up the government of North Korea in order to keep the regime running.//

[https://redd.it/6ykmmg SCP-1539 - Semantic Dissociator]
&gt; //Obviously, this is a washer/dryer set. We even know its model number. Yes, it moved around, spoke, and had the physical attributes of a man (and now it has the attributes of a dead and decaying man.) How does that change that it&#39;s a washer/dryer set?//

[https://redd.it/6oar7k SCP-1564 - Post-Nibbanic]
&gt; //Here, the author is saying &#34;God, I wish there were some magical device that could block these telepathic signals! Too bad that doesn&#39;t exist&#34;.//

[https://redd.it/6t8es3 SCP-1718 - Experimental Containment Unit]

&gt; //The basic setup that you should be aware of: a Site from another universe kicked into our reality, from a parallel Foundation that is less ethical than ours. This idea is explored in great detail.//

[https://redd.it/8p5brb SCP-1730 - What Happened to Site-13? Part II]
&gt; //If there&#39;s something strange in your neighborhood,//
&gt; //Who you gonna call? Samsara!//

[https://redd.it/acmiyk SCP-2122 - The Black Hole]

[https://redd.it/7tm4jc SCP-2123 - I Accidentally The Whole Universe]
&gt; //There are a lot of eithers here in this article. Here, either this collider collides particles currently unknown to mankind, or knowing which particles are collided is somehow dangerous information.//

[https://redd.it/a8lyg9 SCP-2140 - Retroconverter]

&gt; //Worse, it seems that the core is containing Omega, and if that containment were ever to break, the reversed entropy would spread across the entire universe, reversing time back to the Big Bang. It&#39;s set to do just that, breaking its own containment in 2234.//

The pointer tries to access the location in memory of Intestinal Distress; it&#39;s Outside, and no longer under the pointer&#39;s influence. Whatever the case, Dr. Bright assigns the pointer to Intestinal Distress, puts the doctor Inside it.//

[https://redd.it/7h14jz SCP-2740 - It Wasn&#39;t There]
&gt; //This SCP can&#39;t really be understood in-universe, and that&#39;s kind of the point. That nightmare most of us have had: running from something, some unknowable fear, the one Olivia references? This is that bundled with family tragedy and domestic violence.//

&gt; //Hell, by studying the anafabula so heavily, the Foundation has accelerated its own destruction by giving it so many opportunities to enter their universe, and by creating one in the layer just beneath them.//

&gt; //And sadly, the plan of keeping her safe by building her a human body is completely ruined by the Foundation’s existence. The moment the body is finished and she’s able to move with it, the Foundation will either destroy her or lock her up in a dark cell for all time.//

[https://redd.it/7mok5s SCP-2922 - Notes From the Under]

[https://redd.it/fstb0u SCP-005 - The Skeleton Key]
&gt; //Truly, SCP-005 is the most tragic story held by the SCP Foundation, and has arguably been the root for similarly emotional pieces, and should be widely regarded as “The Citizen Kane of the SCP universe”, “Will do for keys what Jaws did for sharks”, and similar praises.//

[https://redd.it/74g9vr SCP Foundation Glossary]
&gt; //**SPC**//
&gt; (No, that&#39;s not a misspelling)
&gt; 
&gt; //Shark Punching Center. Originated as a backronym to make fun of the frequent misspelling of SCP. Became its own quasi-canon/alternate universe, but is considerably more tongue-in-cheek than other canons.//

[https://redd.it/7etlaz Modern Introduction to the SCP Foundation]
&gt; //In 2007, a single creepypasta on a fast-moving 4chan board caught a few people&#39;s attention. Today, it&#39;s grown to become one of the most prominent and impactful science fiction franchises of the early 21st century. A universe awaits. Are you ready to begin?//

[https://redd.it/770rnq Groups of Interest Guide Part 1 - The SCP Foundation, The CI, The GOC, and The Serpent&#39;s Hand]
&gt; //The Foundation has matter and might,
&gt; The Foundation will fight the good fight.
&gt; Since we first lit the spark,
&gt; They would die in the dark,
&gt; So that mankind can live in the light.//

&gt; So that mankind can live in the light.//

[https://redd.it/6yzbeq A History of Sarkicism]
&gt; //Yaldabaoth represented aspects of chaos, flesh and beastiality, barely sentient and content to create and consume. Mekhane was of machines and metal, so Yaldabaoth was not really interested in it. Mekhane simply created the laws of the universe, quietly and progressively bringing order to the void.//

[https://redd.it/87i0iq Apotheosis Series/MTF Tau-5 (&#34;Samsara&#34;)] 
&gt; //They’re pretty controversial in the community, being loved for being immortal superhero dudes and hated for being immortal superhero dudes.//

[https://redd.it/89uayf The Scarlet King] (video)
&gt; //The King gloried in violence and depravity, calling to it the psychopath and the deviant, who then attempted to summon it and bind it to the world, as the King could not make avatars of its own.//

[https://redd.it/8cegt4 Pattern Screamers]
&gt; //Our story begins roughly 90 trillion years ago.//

[https://redd.it/8jwbug Dr. Wondertainment] (video)
&gt; //Dr. Wondertainment may be a company, it may be an individual, it may be an individual that runs a company. Most important, however, is that Dr. Wondertainment is magical, and they make toys.//

[https://redd.it/7xzp80 The Class of &#39;76]
&gt; //The Class of &#39;76 - specifically, the Remembrance series - deals with what happens to ordinary people who are plunged into a world beyond their understanding.//

[https://redd.it/bb0dj8 Gamers Against Weed&#39;s Birth and Further Growth as Exemplified in Three (3) Tales]
&gt; //This tale showed the fact that GAW would have to deal with trauma. That it&#39;s not always jokes. But that it didn&#39;t have to mean dissolution. It didn&#39;t have to mean the end of a friend group. People can get through even the worst shit if they stay together.//
&gt; 
&gt; //This, in a way, helped kind of pave the way for what I hope is a new direction for the group.//

&gt; //Wouldn&#39;t be a Hanged King without a hanged king, would it?//

[https://redd.it/hhgdvx Canon Primer - S &amp; C Plastics]
&gt; //In his own words, it’s meant to be more of a slice-of-life look at the Foundation, as opposed to a grand-scale conflict. The lives of researchers and how they interact with each other and the world at large, for the most part. I took the idea and ran with it.//
