**Containment Procedures:** Subject is temporarily housed in a standard medical suite in Site-1169&#39;s Annex and connected to a ventilator.  An IV is to be kept continually pushing a solution consisting of 91% SCP-4692-2 with a remaining mix of saline and 5% glucose.  


In the event that Site-1169&#39;s backup generator should fail or otherwise become inoperable, subject is to be immediately transported to any neighboring Foundation site with sufficient energy output to maintain the subject&#39;s medical equipment.  


Crews handling SCP-4692 should be, although are not required to be, part of a selected pool of individuals tested for the presence of SCP-4692-3.  If an insufficient number of individuals fitting this requirement are available, volunteers are to be selected on basis of country of origin, with preference given to those with no blood relatives who have lived in the United States of America within the past 75 years.  If an insufficient number of volunteers are available, Class-D Personnel may be assigned.


The ventilator and IV system are not to be disconnected in a non-emergency without approval from Site Director Singh and at least three O5s.  Personnel assigned to SCP-4692 are to be offered Foundation-subsidized counseling services if needed.  All personnel are strongly advised to self-report to their supervisors any trauma sustained as a result of handling SCP-4692, and are to be given priority consideration should they request transfer and/or leave.  Use of amnestics on personnel requesting transfer is to be refused at this time.


In the event of a containment breach, crews assigned to Site-1169 must prioritize the re-establishment of power to the site and the continued delivery of SCP-4692-2 to the subject via the IV solution.  All site personnel and affected individuals must immediately proceed to the basement level 3 and engage the airlock to prevent the release of SCP-4692-3.  Following re-containment, surviving personnel and individuals are to be decontaminated and hospitalized on site.  The deceased are to be incinerated as soon as surviving individuals are removed from basement level 3.


SCP-4692 remains semi-conscious and has been known to appeal to on-site personnel pleading to be euthanized.  Personnel who have been solicited in this way must report each occurrence to the site supervisor.


**Addendum-1:** Due to increased risk of extreme weather conditions as a result of climate change, SCP-4692 is scheduled to be relocated to a more climatically stable site.  Possible sites for relocation include Site-19, Site-34, Site-442, Site-1081, and Site-6119.



**Description:**  SCP-4692 is a African-American male, Jackson W. Parnell, originally of Fayetteville, New York, recovered in Fayetteville, North Carolina.  Mr. Parnell&#39;s birthdate is recorded as ██/██/1912, making him 107 years old as of ██/██/2019; however, his physical appearance suggests he is no older than 45 or 50.  Mr. Parnell requires the use of a medical ventilator and an IV solution of 91% SCP-4692-2 with a remaining mix of 4% saline and 5% glucose in order to stay alive.


SCP-4692-2 is blood plasma from an unidentified individual of Southern or Eastern European descent.  It is believed this individual is the suspect responsible for Mr. Parnell&#39;s current state, as they were last seen exiting the apartment complex where Mr. Parnell was discovered.  A composite sketch of the suspect is attached.  Until the suspect is located and interrogated, attempts to replicate the anomalous qualities of SCP-4692-2 are to begin by 12/01/19.


[[include component:image-block name=http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/local--files/andarielhalo/s00.jpg|caption=Composite sketch of suspect.|width=200px]]


Should either ventilator or IV solution fail, Mr. Parnell will begin to convulse and enter a state of shock at which point a containment breach will be declared.  Within a period of 2 to 4 minutes, any individual who has been in the presence of Mr. Parnell[[footnote]]Estimated to be within a 1 and 1.2 meter radius[[/footnote]] will begin to suffer symptoms similar to but not consistent with acute radiation sickness.  After 8 to 15 minutes, the individual will undergo severe cellular degeneration and hydrolysis, leading to severe dehydration and death.  Decedents will begin to rapidly decompose, with muscle tissue rapidly liquifying and bone marrow desiccating.


After 40 to 55 minutes, direct blood relatives of the affected people will begin to suffer the same effects regardless of physical location.  Additional individuals have also suffered ill effects, including recipients of blood transfusions and individuals with similar genetic structures who are otherwise not blood related.  Affected decedents release SCP-4692-3, an aerosolized variant of SCP-4692-2 which is highly contagious and flourishes under conditions of high humidity.


The resuscitation of Mr. Parnell and the re-establishment of his IV solution following re-containment will cease the effects of SCP-4692 and halt spread of SCP-4692-3.  Individuals who have contracted SCP-4692-3 remain permanently susceptible to SCP-4692 in the future, as well as their direct blood relatives.  Physical damage and/or death sustained during a containment breach is unaffected by re-containment.



**Addendum-2:** The relocation of SCP-4692 to Site-███ has been halted due to complications with Site-███ administration.  Staff on-site alleged that Site Director Laveaux resigned in protest of the proposed relocation.  Site Director Laveaux has refuted these allegations, indicating Site-███ was situated in a region prone to flooding and thus would be unsuitable for housing SCP-4692.


**Addendum-3:** A complaint was filed by Site Director Singh against Site-18104 for allegedly dismantling equipment that could be used to maintain SCP-4692.  Site Director Singh alleges this was in response to an official request to transfer SCP-4692, while Site Director Holt of Site-18104 claims the equipment in question was due for dismantling for over six months prior to the transfer request.






**Discovery:**  SCP-4692 was discovered in the [REDACTED] apartment complex on ██/██/2019.  Surviving witness testimony indicates Mr. Parnell was calling out for help and managed to attract the attention of a resident ([REDACTED]) who subsequently broke in to the apartment.  It is believed Mr. Parnell, due to his condition, persuaded the resident to terminate his life support system in order to euthanize him.  The resident subsequently began to deteriorate and lost consciousness.

Police reports taken in [REDACTED], Florida, Wisconsin, and [REDACTED] parts of North Carolina indicate family members of the resident began to suffer similar symptoms of dizziness, vomiting, bleeding, and seizures, accompanied by rapid necrosis and death.  Confiscated police reports and 911 phone records indicate these occurrences were largely simultaneous, and several officers began to report identical symptoms soon afterwards.

[[include component:image-block name=http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/local--files/andarielhalo/ehted.jpg|caption=[REDACTED], one of the decedents recovered in FL.|width=300px]]

██ officers and ███ additional individuals were hospitalized during this outbreak.  A public health emergency declaration was made in all the affected regions and the FBI became involved.  Some ███ individuals perished during this event.

SCP-4692 was resuscitated by a neighbor of [REDACTED] who discovered Mr. Parnell and re-attached their IV solution and powered their ventilator.  According to the neighbor, Mr. Parnell appeared pale and cold to the touch, but continued to display signs of life and fully recovered once the IV and ventilator were re-established.  The neighbor died 4 days later due to injuries sustained during the outbreak.  A sample of his statement is attached.


[[collapsible show=&#34;Witness Statement ██/██/2019&#34;]]

&gt; [REDACTED] Date ██/██/2019.  **Officer Delgin** interviewing witness **T████ P██████**.  Individual is unlikely to recover from injuries sustained from the incident on ██/██/2019.
&gt; 
&gt; (Transcript highlights witness statement beginning with initial encounter with Mr. Parnell)
&gt; 
&gt; **TP**: I was coming down the stairs.  People were calling out on the street for me so I was coming down hard, I almost fell.  I thought I&#39;d broken something.  Then I heard, like, groaning, like I&#39;d woken the guy up.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delgin**: The guy in the room you found.
&gt; 
&gt; **TP**: Yeah.  I mean, I didn&#39;t know it was a guy in there at first.  I got up and then I heard him talking, he started saying, like, &#34;Help, I been kidnapped&#34; so I was like &#34;What the fuck&#34; and then he called out again, &#34;Help I&#39;m trapped in this guy&#39;s apartment.&#34;  Now I ain&#39;t ever seen anyone going in or out this room except this one guy, but he left like an hour earlier.  I went to the door and could hear him on the other side calling out again so I try to open the door but I can&#39;t.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delgin**: You didn&#39;t think to call the cops at this point?
&gt; 
&gt; **TP**: For real?  And get arrested for trying to break into a white guy&#39;s apartment or some shit?  No, I didn&#39;t even know if it was a real guy calling out to me.  I wasn&#39;t about to do anything except this guy started calling out again, started making banging noises and calling out my name.  He knew my name, he&#39;d been in the apartment for like a year and could hear people talking outside but couldn&#39;t get anybody to help him.  So I try to kick in the door and ended up busting my ass again.  But the doorknob fell off, so I could reach in to remove that chain thing and the other lock.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delgin**: How many locks did it have?
&gt; 
&gt; **TP**: One.  I mean, the doorknob had its own lock but the guy had another lock on top of it, and that chain lock too.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delgin**: What happened inside the apartment, then?
&gt; 
&gt; **TP**: It was, like, you walk in and the guy was right ahead in the living room.  He was laid out on a hospital bed looking thing, and he had like an oxygen mask on and a needle in his arm that was pumping something yellow into him.  He didn&#39;t look sick but he was barely moving.  He was strapped down to the bed like he was being tortured or something.  He got a hand out and was able to bang on the wall and pull up his mask so he could call for help, but his voice was weak and he couldn&#39;t breathe without it.  It was lucky I heard him when I did, he was probably calling for help for days and no one heard him.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delgin**: Did he say who was keeping him tied up?
&gt; 
&gt; **TP**: Nah.  I mean, he probably knew the guy&#39;s name, but I wasn&#39;t thinking about that at the time.  Guy was like freaking out, excited, I had come to help him.  I went over to him and he said to pull the needle out of him and untie him.  I mean, it didn&#39;t look like the guy was getting real medical treatment, it was a little plastic bag hanging from a plastic hanger full of this yellow stuff, it looked like it could&#39;ve been urine.  I pulled the needle out quick then helped undo the leather strap around his wrist.  Guy started crying, thanking me, saying he wanted to die but this other guy wouldn&#39;t let him.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delgin**: When did the pain start?
&gt; 
&gt; **TP**: I think like, right away I knew something wasn&#39;t right.  But it wasn&#39;t until I got the needle out of the guy and started untying him that, like, I felt like my insides were starting to get hot.  I turned my head away to cough, like into my elbow so I wasn&#39;t coughing on the dude.  Then I was coughing nonstop and like, each cough my head would hurt, and I started stumbling back.  I couldn&#39;t stop coughing and then I started feeling like I had to throw up.  I put my head back, and threw up a little and had to swallow it down.  Then my side started hurting, like real bad.  Like here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delgin**: In your ribs?
&gt; 
&gt; **TP**: It felt like something exploded in there and cracked my ribs.  I kept gagging and choking and then I threw up again.  I tried to swallow it down like I don&#39;t wanna be puking all over the floor and then end up slipping and busting my ass again.  I thought it was a little bit, but then it started shooting out my nose.  That freaked me out a little, so I stopped trying to hold it back and I just let loose all over the floor.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delgin**: Did it hurt?
&gt; 
&gt; **TP**: Everything hurt.  My stomach, my ribs, my throat, my nose, all of it hurt.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delgin**: Was there any blood?
&gt; 
&gt; **TP**: Not yet, not at first.  I got back up to try to help the guy but he was out, like he was shaking and he was rocking like he was about to die or something.  More vomit kept coming up so I just left the room I had no idea what was happening maybe the guy was like poisoned or giving off some kind of chemical that was making me sick.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delgin**: Did you see anything in the air, or smell anything?  Where was the needle during this, and the plastic bag?
&gt; 
&gt; **TP**: I didn&#39;t see anything and nothing smelled except the dude, he smelled like, like a homeless guy.  Not that bad that I&#39;d be throwing up, though.  The needle, I don&#39;t know I didn&#39;t touch it I just pulled on the tube to get it out.  After a while I started getting really sweaty and it was getting in my eyes and I couldn&#39;t wipe it away because I had puke all over my hands.  I was like, I had to get outside, something in the room was fucking with us.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delgin**: How did you alert the others?
&gt; 
&gt; **TP**: What others?
&gt; 
&gt; **Delgin**: Your friends outside.  They started screaming and called the police saying people were getting sick and vomiting everywhere.
&gt; 
&gt; **TP**: I didn&#39;t call out to them.  I got out into the hall and then my legs went.  I didn&#39;t hear them snap but they felt like they just broke into pieces and I hit my head on the wall and went out like a light.  I didn&#39;t talk to anybody else.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delgin**: This was around 4:20, you said?  4:20 PM?
&gt; 
&gt; **TP**: Yeah, I remember because one of my friends outside was shouting, like &#34;Yo, T████, 420, bitch!  Get moving!  420!&#34;  So I checked my phone it was 4:20 right before I heard the guy&#39;s voice.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delgin**: The guy calling for help
&gt; 
&gt; **TP**: Yeah.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delgin**: The first 911 call came in at 4:24 PM.  You&#39;re saying no one heard you or saw you?
&gt; 
&gt; **TP**: I don&#39;t see how.  The guy was beside a window but the window was like, that thick kind like they got that looks like ice and you can&#39;t really see through.  It was like that.  Plus the lights were out so I don&#39;t know how anyone could&#39;ve seen anything.  I don&#39;t know how they knew, maybe someone came up and found me unconscious and called 911.
