**Item #:** SCP-5801

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5801 has been acquired by the Foundation and is designated as private property. Any civilians who reach SCP-5801&#39;s designated red zone are to be amnesticized and relocated by posted guards. All testing and interviews involving SCP-5801-1 instances are to take place outside of the barrier surrounding SCP-5801.

**Description:** SCP-5801 is an undisclosed location in Nome, Alaska. A barrier composed of an unknown transparent material surrounds SCP-5801. The barrier is 7 m in height, and encloses an area that is 22.4 m in diameter. Both instances of SCP-5801-1 and personnel are unable to pass through the barrier.

SCP-5801 contains instances of SCP-5801-1, which are sapient beings composed out of three spherical masses of snow, and possess tree branches in the place of limbs. Materials making up the facial features of SCP-5801-1 vary, but recorded materials include sticks, leaves, berries, vegetables, and rocks. SCP-5801-1 instances possess the ability to speak and move, and have been observed to converse with each other on a regular basis.

According to interviews with multiple SCP-5801-1 instances, SCP-5801 is an afterlife for deceased individuals whose effigies were shaped into SCP-5801-1 through a ritualistic process. Due to the absence of new SCP-5801-1 instances, it is assumed that this process no longer occurs.[[footnote]]Possibly due to the Foundation&#39;s awareness of SCP-5801.[[/footnote]]

**Addendum 5801-01: Interview Log:** The following is an interview with an instance of SCP-5801-1, referred to as SCP-5801-1-A. The interview was conducted by researcher Morrissey.
&gt; //SCP-5801-1-A waddles close to the barrier. SCP-5801-1-A bears facial features composed completely out of blueberries, and stands approximately 1.8 m tall. Researcher Morrissey stands on the other side of the barrier.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrissey:** Hey, uh excuse me?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5801-1-A:** Pardon?
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrissey:** Hi, my name is Morrissey. I’m a researcher working for the SCP Foundation. You probably see our team around here often. I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions if you’re not busy.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5801-1-A:** Well yeah of course. Ain’t a lot to keep me busy here anyways.
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrissey:** Alright then, can I get your first name please?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5801-1-A:** Yeah uh, it’s Pete.
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrissey:** Okay Pete, do you recall your life before you came here?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5801-1-A:** Thankfully yes.
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-5801-1-A lets out a chuckle.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5801-1-A:** I was a farmer. I had my own little dairy company. Good lil’ farm I had there. It was a family business too.
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrissey:** Was the person who brought you here in your family?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5801-1-A:** Sadly, I don’t think I’m allowed to say.
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrissey:** And why is that?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5801-1-A:** They know y’all are monitoring this place, and they told me they’d send me to the “Frosted Abyss” if I told y’all who they were. What that means? Hell if I know.
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrissey:** Huh. Alright then. Perhaps you can tell me about the ritual that sent you here?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5801-1-A:** Well I didn’t hear about no punishment about telling y’all about the ritual, so I guess I can give you what I remember. On my deathbed they told me to “declare that I am truly afraid of death and wish to be frozen in this life” or something along those lines. Then they said some mystical mumbo-jumbo out of some spellbook, and then told me that my body would be buried in a mound of snow. It was to “preserve my essence in ice” or something like that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrissey:** Are you actually afraid of death?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5801-1-A:** Without question my friend, without question. I didn’t really believe in no god so I had no hope in an afterlife. I thought death would be the end of my consciousness and feeling. I was scared to death until they showed up. Of course I’m assuming I can’t tell y’all how I met them, so I’ll just leave it at that. And now, I’m here. Still conscious and all. Still don’t know what to feel about it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrissey:** Alright, thank you for your time. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5801-1-A:** Hey, anytime my friend. Again, there ain’t much to do around here so this was time well spent.
&gt; 
&gt; **END LOG**

**Addendum 5801-02: Interview Log 2:** The following is an interview with an instance of SCP-5801-1, referred to as SCP-5801-1-B. The interview was conducted by researcher Morrissey.
&gt; //SCP-5801-1-B is close to the barrier. SCP-5801-1-B bears two rocks for eyes, a carrot for a nose, and a mouth made from blueberries. SCP-5801-1-B stands approximately 1.2 m tall.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrissey:** Hey, you there! The little guy!
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-5801-1-B turns around.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5801-1-B:** Oh, hi! Are you one of those sciency people?
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrissey:** (chuckles) Why yes I am. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5801-1-B:** Cool! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrissey:** (chuckles) Yeah, I was wondering if I could ask you some questions.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5801-1-B:** Sure! Will it help with your science stuff?
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrissey:** Why yes it will. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5801-1-B:** Yay! I&#39;m ready.
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrissey:** Alrighty then. What is your name?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5801-1-B:** I&#39;m Timothy, but you can call me Timmy!
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrissey:** Awesome! Well Timmy, I was wondering how you got to this place.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5801-1-B:** Well, I had a thing called a brain tumor, and mommy and daddy didn&#39;t want me to die. So they took me to these people called the-
&gt; 
&gt; //Before SCP-5801-1-B is able to finish its sentence, its facial features begin to slide down its face.// 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5801-1-B:** No, I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to tell them, I didn’t!
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-5801-1-B&#39;s head inverts.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5801-1-B:** No, please! Mommy, mommy...
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-5801-1-B&#39;s body begins to thaw, disintegrating into a mass of slush. The slush dissolves into water. A heart resembling that of a human’s remains in the middle of the puddle. Nearby SCP-5801-1 instances take notice of this event, reacting with a mixture of fear and sadness.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrissey:** Oh god.
