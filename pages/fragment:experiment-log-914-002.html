**Test 914-0200**
**Name:** Quantum computing researcher Ling &amp; IT-Technician Sharma
**Date:** 30/04/2018
**Total Items:** Two 2048 Qubit QPUs (Quantum Processing Unit) manufactured by D-Wave Systems.

**Input:** One QPU
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One 2048 bead abacus constructed from silicon, aluminum, and ceramic.
The beads are arranged in four columns of ten rows, with thirty-two silicon beads in each cell.
When a bead in one cell is moved, a random assortment of other beads will move as well. No distinct pattern has been found in these movements.

**Input:** One QPU
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One 2048 QPU with &#34;Output (Binary)&#34; and &#34;Output (Analog)&#34; printed on the top left and right corners of the chip, &#34;Input (Binary)&#34; and &#34;Input (Analog)&#34; printed on the bottom left and right corners of the chip.
The binary input channel only accepts data in the form of digital signals like document files, audio files, network data, and computer programs. The analog input channel only accepts direct signals from radio, voltage, microphones, and signal generators.
The new QPU appears to convert input data in a similar way to SCP-914 in the &#34;1:1&#34; setting. Only one input channel will accept data at a time, the corresponding output channel will output data as a digital signal (file, network-stream, or data-stream) or an analog signal (audio signal, waveform, or radio wave).

**Output:** One small round plastic disk (radius 1cm, height 7mm) with no battery slot. Recorded audio (seven days max) can be downloaded from the disk by connecting the top and bottom sides of the disk to the two wires of a microphone cable. The object records all audible vibrations in a 50m sphere around the object, including sounds beyond soundproof walls within the radius.

**Input:** One audio recorder
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One device with the same exterior form as a Foundation standard issue clandestine audio recorder. The device functions as a regular foundation recorder, but instead of recording local audio, the device records a random, currently ongoing, conversation between two or more people. No distance limit to this effect has been found. The device is currently used as a global monitoring tool.

**Test 914-0207**
**Name:** Dr. C. Jung, Research assistant A.Y. Lichko
**Date:** 30/04/2018
**Total Items:** Five Foundation Class C Amnestic Injectors

**Input:** One (injector)
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** A small metal cube (aluminium), a pile of white powder (████████████-██████-█████████, the active ingredient for amnestics), and a puddle of liquid that ignited into a blue flame upon touch (presumed to be the inactive carrier fluid)

**Input:** One (injector)
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** One disassembled injector and a cloud of ████████████-██████-█████████ in gaseous form.

//Note: Assistant was brought back up to speed regarding the tests with SCP-914 after a short rest.// - Jung

**Input:** One (injector)
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One decorative aluminium floral brooch (Catharanthus roseus) the scent of which causes the subject to lose all recollection of events preceding for at least one day. This &#34;scent&#34; is immeasurable and undetectable by anything other than humans and only works at a close range, about 50 cm.

//Note: Assistant Lichko has been given a hazmat suit for future testing// - Jung

**Input:** One (injector)
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One Foundation Class C Amnestic Injector. The object is mostly unchanged except for the two rotary dials that have been added to the bottom of the injector. The dials appear to indicate an exact range of recollection to erase (scaling between 1 minute and 30 days).

**Input:** One (injector)
**Setting:** Very fine
**Output:** [REDACTED]

//Note: This object, if it even is an object, is a cognitohazard. It erases all of the subject&#39;s memory when it views the item. A cognitohazard containment team has removed it from SCP-914&#39;s output chamber. Research assistant A.Y. Lichko has been transferred to the infirmary. - Jung//

**Test 914-0208**
**Name:** Dr Lachlan O’Hehir, Lieutenant Rueben GreenTree
**Date:** 30/04/2018
**Total Items:** 3 Pairs of 3D glasses (Glasses are polarised 3D glasses, which is the design that modern cinemas use)

**Input:** One pair of 3D glasses
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One pair of 3D glasses, except with a brand logo on the side (Samsung), still works as expected with minor differences in colour (compared to original)

**Input:** One pair of 3D glasses
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One pair of 3D glasses with no obvious difference, when put on, however, the viewer sees any 2D image as a 3D image and sees the 3D world with a more stretched field of view.

//Note: Using the 3D glasses in the already 3D world has no use, it just makes things look marginally further away than where they should be.//

**Input:** One pair of 3D glasses
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One mask with lenses over the eyes, when put on the lenses redirect to align themselves with the viewers eyes, the viewer experiences the world with an added dimension, 2D objects like shadows or pictures become 3D, 3D objects irregulate and create a second version of themselves, within themselves, resulting in interior and exterior shadowing. Objects will grow a 4th dimension, rather than adding onto the (X,Y,Z) axis, the glasses merge a second (X,Y,Z) Axis into the original, the 2 merged axis create 1 bigger axis of (X,X,Y,Z,Z). The second Y Axis is merged with the original, (although any 2 axis can merge). This resulted in many Class D’s who were tested on to feel extreme nausea and headaches. One account that lasted over 15 minutes with the glasses on (average time is 3 minutes before the subject pulls out) said she saw sharp, paper thin objects that were piercing through solid matter. This is presumably 1D objects gaining depth.

//Note: Items were put into storage as they may be of use in the future. - Dr. O’Hehir//

------

**Test 914-0209**
**Name:** Chief Security Officer Wright
**Date:** 30/04/2018
**Total Items:** Five outdated copies of paperback handbooks (24 pages long) that were once provided to new recruits of Site security teams.

//Note: God, these things were awful back in the day. I have a box full of them and I am glad to put them to use. - Chief Security Officer Wright//

**Input:** One handbook
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** Handbook was rewritten to correct spelling errors, provide effective advice, and remove unnecessary information which left six pages blank. The cover depicts an ink illustration of a security guard. The back of the handbook has text that provides recommendations for other orientation material.

**Input:** One handbook
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** Ten brochures that contain summaries and outdated text from [http://www.scp-wiki.net/lockdown-procedures the orientation manual regarding lockdown procedures.] Notably, all brochures end with &#34;If everything fails, go to the Gate.&#34; The meaning of the statement is currently unknown.

**Input:** One handbook
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Each page depicts illustrations of contained SCP objects and brief advice to survive an encounter.

**Input:** One handbook
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Handbook is rewritten in Mandarin.

**Input:** One handbook
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** Twenty-two animate origami instances depicting security personnel, and one instance which would take the form of an SCP object. They are incapable of vocalization and appear to be sapient, but requires further testing. Instances would attempt to perform a scenario of a containment breach, and demonstrate the appropriate actions in response. During the scenario, one instance would perform gestures toward nearby personnel to direct their attention to the actions being taken.

//Note: D class personnel who were instructed to enter the room with the bulb applied, reported a general feeling of uneasiness and nausea. Further testing required.//

**Input** One incandescent light bulb.
**Setting** Rough
**Output** A powdery sand-like substance. When touched, personnel describe it feeling like &#34;powdered sugar&#34;. When the material is placed in a standard zip lock bag and shaken, a bright yellowish light is produced similar to that of a standard incandescent light bulb.

//Note: Request to keep this bag as a personal light source in case my flashlight dies - Researcher Blais//

//Note: Request approved - Dr. Veritas//

**Input** One incandescent light bulb.
**Setting** Very Fine
**Output** One anthropomorphic humanoid light bulb. Object vocalized to staff in English with a slight German accent. Claimed to be Thomas Edison who is (erroneously) credited with inventing the first light bulb.

//Note: This thing will not stop talking about its &#34;grand scientific achievements&#34; to everyone it meets. Request to gain as much information as possible about its existence and smash it with a sledgehammer?&#34; - Researcher Blais//

//Note: Just incinerate it, Blais. - Dr. Veritas//

**Test 914-0213**
**Name:** Dr. Hadian
**Date:** 02/05/2018
**Total Items:** Five packets of instant ramen, including seasoning; five stainless steel pots, filled with approximately half a liter of water each.

//Note: This experiment is a further exploration of the 1:1 function. No products from this experiment are to be consumed.//

**Input:** One set of assembled items
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One uncooked pot of gruel. The noodles appear to have lost integrity, leaving an aqueous grain solution.

**Input:** One set of assembled items
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A pot of cooked noodles and a cloud of steam; the steel pot was hot to the touch. Examination showed that the noodles had been overcooked and would not be particularly pleasant fare; speculated to be about as desirable as consuming the raw packet.

**Input:** One set of assembled items
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A stainless steel pot, containing noodles but no water. Produced sloshing sounds upon being picked up, and the mass was the same. The pot is also slightly bigger, suggesting SCP-914 added an internal chamber that now stores the water. Confirmed through use of power tools for puncture.

**Input:** One set of assembled items
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** An uncooked pot of pasta. The overall composition remains the same, but the shapes of the noodles have been changed to resemble macaroni. Contents were also marginally more soggy than usual, but it&#39;s not currently known if this is due to any action on SCP-914&#39;s part.

**Input:** One set of assembled items
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** The same set of items, unaltered.

//Note: &#39;&#39;...Guess it got kind of tired of this exercise. Huh.&#39;&#39; -Dr. Hadian//

------

**Test 914-0214**
**Name:** Janitor Kurt
**Date:** 04/05/2018

**Test 914-0217**
**Name:** Researcher Blais
**Date:** 05/05/2018
**Total Items:**  Two pairs of standard UV protection sunglasses.

**Input:** One pair of sunglasses.
**Setting:** Rough.
**Output:** One tinted pane of glass //Dimensions 50x50x3 mm.// When pointed at a light and looked through, the pane generates extreme hallucinations from the light source. Such hallucinations have included &#34;dragons and smoke monsters&#34; to &#34;birds with blue flaming wings and horns like a goat&#34;. Hallucinations vary from subject to subject and seem to have no correlation to the viewer&#39;s mental state or personality. When the pane is turned away from the source, the hallucinations immediately cease and &#34;reset&#34; until turned back to the light.

//Note: &#39;&#39;Multiple D-class subjects have reported seeing a &#34;Deer with enormous antlers and crazy floating orbs&#34; when looking through the pane of glass. Investigation into a possible connection to [[[SCP-2845]]] is underway.&#34;//

**Input:** One pair of sunglasses.
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output** One pair of aviator style sunglasses with mirrored lenses. Memetic effects occur when a person views another individual wearing the sunglasses. Subjects will exclaim and persist that the glasses are the most “extremely stylish” and “hip” they have ever seen. Further testing is in order.

//Note: Definitely the most sexy pair of sunglasses I’ve ever seen in my life. I have to keep them if I’m ever going to get a date - Researcher Blais//

//Note: Sure Blais, of course I&#39;m going to let you keep an anomalous object for your personal gain. I stored it in the anomalous item wing for study. Don&#39;t ask where, I&#39;m not telling you. - Dr. Veritas//

**Test 914-0218**
**Name:** Foundation mathematicians Cantor &amp; Hausdorff
**Date:** 12/05/2018
**Total Items:** Three print-outs of the Banach–Tarski paradox theorem &amp; three iron spheres, 3 kilograms each.

**Input:** One print-out &amp; one Sphere
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One print-out describing knot-theory &amp; one iron trefoil knot.

//Note: The knot has no apparent seams or welding spots, this is beautifully made. - Cantor//

**Input:** One print-out &amp; one Sphere
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One collection of five intersecting tetrahedra forming an icosahedron with a paper origami woven between the tetrahedra to spell out one of the numbers 1 through 20 on each of the twenty icosahedrons faces. The &#34;1&#34; and &#34;20&#34; faces are inked completely black, the other numbers are white paper. Rolling the &#34;D20&#34; has no observable anomalous effects.

//Note: 3 kilo something makes for a heavy D20. - Cantor//
//Note: We&#39;ll use it for special occasions. - Hausdorff//

**Input:** One print-out &amp; one Sphere
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One origami klein bottle inscribed with [[[SCP-3669 |SCP-3669-2]]], function unknown, awaiting O5 approval for the creation of an SCP-3669-1 to discern the meaning of the inscriptions.
One or two iron sphere(s). It is unclear if the spheres are truly two separate objects, or one object simultaneously in multiple locations.
The &#34;spheres&#34; are solid only to matter that is not the other sphere, they &#34;phase&#34; through each other when they touch. The sum mass of the spheres when separate is 6 kilograms, when fully phased into each other the sum mass is 3 kilograms.

//Note: I don&#39;t understand these arrows.. and why is the paper klein bottle shaped? - Cantor//

//Note: I&#39;m still unsure if we&#39;ve solved the Banach–Tarski paradox with these iron orbs, I do know that they are giving me a headache - Hausdorff//

**Input:** 1 character sheet for the tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons &amp; Dragons, 3.5th Edition, filled out by Researcher Thompson.
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A sheet of paper promoting the non-existent tabletop roleplaying game Fear in the Foundation, 1st Edition. The paper repeatedly makes claims about the fun factor of the game but gives little information as to its actual content. Upon reading the entirety of the paper, subjects undergo an out-of-body experience in which they perceive themselves to exist in the game world. Based on subject’s reports, elements of the game are taken from several different tabletop roleplaying games. The game is also noted to contain several Foundation and SCP-related characters, items, and locations. Subjects will exit this state upon either dying in the game, or defeating the final villain.

//Note: &#34;I gave this a try, and ended up seeing [[[SCP-096]]]&#39;s face after rolling a 1 on stealth. If you don&#39;t hear from me within 5 minutes, I&#39;ve blown my brains out.&#34; -Researcher Jacobson//

//Note: &#34;Researcher Jacobson was later found dead in the anomalous item storage wing. Access to &#39;Fear in the Foundation&#39; now requires supervision of at least one armed member of site security in case of visual hazards.&#34;// --O5-6

**Name:** Dr Sheldon
**Date:** 01/09/2018
**Total Items:** Eight candles each 15 centimetres in height and 1 centimetres in diameter, composed of wax and a cotton wick

**Input:** One of the aforementioned candles
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** A pile of carbon, cellulose, and hydrogen gas

**Input:** One of the aforementioned candles
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** Thirty pieces of the candle each equivalent in size

**Input:** One of the aforementioned candles
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One candle, seemingly identical to the input. Upon further testing, it was discovered to burn precisely forty times longer than it should have. The flame is steady and recordings with a high speed camera have shown no more than a millimeter variance of the flame’s dimensions. The light produced is in the 590 to 560 nanometer range, appearing yellow to the human eye.

**Input:** One of the aforementioned candles
**Setting:** Very fine
**Output:** Candle was modified into a ball of wax with a radius of ten centimeters. The surface, upon measuring with an electron microscope, was discovered to possess no flaws even at the nanometer resolution. Through further testing, it was determined that the “candle” will spontaneously ignite when the light in the immediate area around it dropped below the level required to discern colour. Upon ignition, the candle levitates to a height of two meters and stays there until the ambient light is sufficient for human eyes. The flame it produces lacks any heat and emits only light.

A second property of the sphere has been observed accidentally by a D-Class. Upon transporting it to a secure containment unit, the D-Class passed through the cryogenic containment units. The sudden drop in temperature caused the sphere to immediately ignite. The flame it produced in response to the sub-zero temperatures did not emit any light, but produced a flame with a temperature of 10,000 degrees Celsius. The D-Class was immediately killed by the extreme heat. Object is now in secure containment in a room with a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius and ambient lighting of 200 lumen.

**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** 1 origami helicopter (modeled after a Bell UH-1 Iroquois), the windows are painted on with glittery black ink, the engine compartment is made of red sealing wax. After manually winding the blades the helicopter can fly a short distance in a random direction.
**Notes:** The candle produced a small spark and puff of smoke. A pair of human ears, a human nose &amp; voluptuous lips were drawn on the paper.
//I&#39;m not quite sure what the candle is signaling here, it should just light itself when the seal traverses to another reality, this effect needs further investigation. The face drawn on the tracking papers is too crude to do any facial recognition on, lets see if the Very Fine setting helps. - Dr. Devant//

**Input:** 1 tracking envelope.
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** 1 wax sealed envelope, addressed to the high school nickname of Dr. Devant, the seal was stamped with a heart symbol. Inside the envelope was a letter of rejection to Dr. Devant, written in black glittery ink. This letter is currently being investigated for cognitohazardous effects.
**Notes:** The candle was lit. The paper had random scribbles all over. When all five outputs on the papers were overlaid it produced a sketch of ████████ ████████████  (now deceased), a helicopter pilot and former high school romantic interest of Dr. Devant. Dr. Devant has been placed in the psych ward after excessive sobbing and showing of suicidal tendencies.

//This one&#39;s odd to me. All my experiments so far have conformed to the belief that SCP-914 works via associations of the operator. Unless the good Doctor can tell me otherwise, that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case here. I would suggest against using thaumaturgy on 914, it&#39;s already weird enough as is. -Researcher  K. Midaeus//

**Test 914-0262**
**Name:** Researcher L. Sheele
**Date:** 19/10/2018
**Total Items:** One plastic bowl of various brands of store purchased candy, and one note containing the words &#34;Take three pieces please.&#34;
//Note - I&#39;m hoping to get something similar to [[[SCP-330]]], but less... endangering to the trick-or-treaters. -Researcher L. Sheele//

**Input:** Aforementioned candy bowl and note.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** The same candy bowl and note, but with three pieces removed and set to the floor beside it. The three extracted pieces are unable to be consumed; subjects who attempt to will instead insist they are &#34;for someone else.&#34; Remaining pieces show no anomalous properties.
//Note 2- You// cannot //be serious. This thing is just one big clockwork smartass. -Researcher L. Sheele//

**Input:** Previous bowl containing the remaining candy and note attached.
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** Contents unchanged, no effects apparent until all candy is removed. Once emptied, subjects who observe the bowl will feel excessively compulsed to fill it and will attempt to do so with anything available, including liquids, possessions of significance to the subject, vital organs (if tools capable of incision are provided,) and materials found hazardous to the subject or container. Effects are not present to those who view the object through camera feeds or photographs. Contents of the bowl showed no remarkable properties.

**Subject(s):** D-33874-914
**Provision(s):** Original contents of bowl.
**Results:** Subject&#39;s view of the item was obscured and was placed into testing area; contents of bowl removed and placed on a separate table. Upon making eye contact, the subject became visibly distraught and made numerous agitated exclaims about the sight before beginning to fill the bowl with candy. Once this task was completed, the subject resumed in a stable emotional state.

**Subject(s):** D-33874-914
**Provision(s):** Approximately one hundred and fifty [REDACTED], provided in a steel container and heated to 73 degrees Celsius.
**Results:** Subject was set up as before and told to look at the empty bowl, displaying a similar reaction to the previous experiment. After about a minute of this, D-33874 approached the container and attempted to relocate them into the bowl. Subject was successful in removing a total of four [REDACTED], receiving multiple third degree burns to both hands. Subject was detained after attempting to retrieve a fifth orally. A full analysis shows the subject has yet to recover from the effects of the object. The object received significant burns and became warped in several places.

[DATA EXPUNGED]

//Note 3: The remaining tests have been removed for brevity. The object has been sent to an anomalous item storage facility and is pending classification, but I think I need to make this clarification here: I would recommend being a lot more cautious in the future regarding testing of objects produced by the &#34;Very Fine&#34; setting of SCP-914. They&#39;re hard to manage, harder to predict and even harder to clean up after. That will be all. -Dr. Clarentine.//

**Test 914-0264**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Gregorius
**Date:** ██/11/20██
**Total Items:** Two chessboards, wood with wooden pieces, initial configuration. Two booklets describing the basic rules of chess, in English.

//Note - We know what 914 does with a chessboard on 1:1. I wonder what it does on other settings. - Jr. Researcher Gregorius//

**Input:** One chessboard, one booklet
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One translucent &#34;3D Chess&#34; cube with pieces, one booklet describing the rules of &#34;3D Chess&#34; in 18th century Russian. The cube is made of a cellulose and protein-based aerogel with a wooden base. It is subdivided into 8x8x8 smaller cubes, the sides of which are equal in length to the sides of the fields on the original chessboard. These cubes are alternately light and dark colored. The pieces are made of hollow wood but are identical to the original pieces. Each side has sixty-four pawns, sixteen rooks, knights and bishops, eight queens, and eight kings. The pieces are arranged in columns in the original starting configuration but the booklet describes alternative starting configurations available to the players. The base has controls for highlighting one horizontal or vertical plane of the cube, this lighting operates from two AA-size batteries (not included). This highlight is non-anomalous, using ultrasound emitted from miniature speakers in the base in combination with sound-activated bioluminescent proteins in the aerogel. The total mass of the outputs is identical to the mass of the input items.
The aerogel yields easily to human touch, allowing players to move the pieces. Once the player removes their hand, the gel quickly expands to refill the space left behind retaining the original coloration of the cubes.
The rules described in the booklet are generally a more restrictive extrapolation of normal 2D chess rules when multiple extrapolations would be possible (for example, pawns can still only move in one direction, and bishops need to move in all three dimensions at once).
After sampling the aerogel, the item was assigned to Site-19 breakroom. A translation of the rule booklet is available on the intranet.

//Note - due to the large number of pieces and the need to capture 7 out of the 8 kings before the last king can be put into checkmate, the games are expected to take quite long. Prospective players should allocate their break time accordingly. Also, a computer version of the game is available on the intranet if you&#39;d like to practice for the upcoming tournament. - Jr. Researcher Gregorius//

**Input:** One chessboard, one booklet
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One apparently wooden disk with &#34;4D Chess&#34; printed on it, one combined instruction manual and rule booklet in contemporary Navajo transcribed in Greek script.
When two players touch the disk simultaneously, an image of a four-dimensional hypercube is projected into their minds. The pieces inside the hypercube are arranged in a way similar to the 3D version. The players can move the pieces with mental commands. While touching the disk, they can conceptualize and visualize the four-dimensional space as easily as they would a normal three-dimensional space. This ability only lasts as long as they are touching the game but isn&#39;t limited to the game space. The rules of the game are similar to those of the 3D version.
Item assigned to Site-19 breakroom.

//I&#39;d like to requisition this item to help in my higher-dimensional topology research - Jr. Researcher C███████.//
//Granted. Just return it to the breakroom when you&#39;re finished - O5-██//

**Test 914-0277**
**Name:** Dr. Lefèvre‑Gineau
**Date:** 12/11/2018
**Total Items:** Five copies of the International Prototype of the Kilogram (IPK), these metal cylinders are made of a platinum-iridium alloy at a 9 to 1 ratio. These (soon to be obsolete) weights are used as the standard to define the kilogram.

**Input:** One IPK
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** One 902.36g cube of platinum &amp; One  97.64g sphere of iridium.

**Input:** One IPK
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** One platinum-iridium alloy meteorite, when cut in half the meteorite showed a Widmanstätten pattern.

//Normally the Widmanstätten pattern would not form in a platinum-iridium based meteorite. The sight is mesmerizing though - Dr. Lefèvre‑Gineau//

**Input:** One IPK
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One platinum-iridium alloy rod precisely 1 meter long with a diameter of roughly 3.88mm.

**Input:** One IPK
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One square platinum plate with an iridium &#34;antenna&#34; protruding on its far side. The plate has a radial meter embossed on its center ranging from 0 to 5, from its center protrudes an iridium needle pointing towards the &#34;one&#34; position. This needle moves to higher &amp; lower positions when the device is pointed toward anomalous phenomena. No interior parts have been found.

//I believe this device to be a hume-meter of some kind, however, it responds to anomalous objects in different ways than a standard Foundation hume-meter, as if it&#39;s measuring true reality compared to relative reality. - Dr. Lefèvre‑Gineau//

**Input:** One IPK
**Setting:** Very fine
**Output:** One platinum weighing mass with tapered handle &amp; ornate embossments of the phrase &#34;1 kilogram&#34; in various languages. X-ray imaging of the device showed an internal space filled with iridium metal parts moving continuously and chaotically. Its anomalous effect is made apparent when the &#34;weight&#34; is placed on the surface of an object that is not fastened to the ground in some way, this object will now weigh exactly one kilogram regardless of local gravity or acceleration. The object behaves like a regular weighing mass when used on a balance scale.

//I recommend using magnetic boots when carrying this weight, walking whilst weighing only one kilo has proven to be very difficult. Dr. Lefèvre‑Gineau//
