&#34;They called me a madman. They said this would never work. &#39;How are you even going to make a wooden stand fly?&#39; But here I am. I succeeded. Now that the worst part is gone, there is only one thing left to do: get fucking rich.&#34;

Three days after the grand opening of &#34;Joe&#39;s Little Emporium of Everything You May or May Not Need&#34;, things were going better than expected. Who would have thought that the deadly remains of ancient warriors in the middle of the Kingdom of Gdu&#39; Gnar, inside the biggest cave system of Callisto, would enjoy his patented &#34;Blue Lily Beer&#34; so much? Even though he used the frozen lilies that grew in the area in it, the base process of the beer was normal, with wheat malt and everything. The flowers were purely for decorative purposes, and yet he still charged double the amount of a normal drink. But the customers didn&#39;t need to know that.

&#34;Good morning, sir. How can I serve you today?&#34; Joe rubbed his long and pointy mustache as he looked for any sign of a bag full of little crystals on the tall and ominous figure.

&#34;I would like to acquire one of your so called &#39;guns&#39;.&#34; The skeletal purplish warrior put his right hand inside his ice armor and grabbed a little leather pouch. Very little, in fact. Way smaller than Joe was expecting.

&#34;Ah yes, sir. Outstanding choice! It will be... ten thousand topaz, please,&#34; said the man with a pretentious smile, expecting the knight to walk away or beg for a discount.

&#34;Do you have change for fifty?&#34; The warrior opened the little pouch, and took a red gem in the shape of a star from it.

The deep voice of the almost dead knight echoed inside Joe&#39;s mind as he looked at the crystal, shocked. His smile turned into a dropped jaw, which quickly turned into an even bigger smile than before. He snatched the gem from the figure and started examining it, as he needed to be sure that gold mine was real. It was.

The entrepreneur had to think fast. Taking money from people is an art, but any mistake could be his end, especially when the risk is as high as it was at that moment.

&#34;You... uh... You know what? It is your lucky day, sir! I have right here a package with some exclusive weaponry that could be of your interest,&#34; he said, maintaining visual contact with the gem at all times.

Joe ran to the back of his shack, opened one of his gun lockers and started looking for something that could easily fool the knight. He threw aside pistols, assault rifles and rocket launchers, until he finally found an old and rusty double-barreled shotgun.

Grabbing the weapon and a handful of shells, Joe made his way back to the front counter, where the skeletal figure was standing patiently.

&#34;This right here, sir, is called the &#39;Margwa&#39;s Might&#39;. A wonderful relic I unraveled while exploring ancient ruins in Europa. A single shot can easily kill twenty men, all at once.&#34; The lie was solid. Joe knew how much these living skeletons liked oddly named objects, and the name he gave that shotgun was perfect.

&#34;Who is... Margwa?&#34;

&#34;Fuck. Shit.&#34; He was good. Joe was getting close to the prize, but the warrior was making things difficult. He knew how to come up with a good lie, but he was pretty bad at elaborating it. He prayed that the pile of bones was as stupid as it looked, and started to create a generic story using non-existant words.

&#34;Ah yes. According to the tomes I found in the abandoned temple, and note that my understanding of the... Kut... Kuthahaar language is not the best, it was a deceased god. Apparently, when the god died, it fell on the northen region of Europa, hitting the ground and creating the... mountain range of that area, yes. I believe it was the god of fire and warmth, and when he died, Europa became as cold as it is nowadays.&#34; He was sweating. It was more than minus one hundred degrees celsius in that cave, but he was still sweating. His smile began to crack and his left hand was shaking. The knight knew what was up, and Joe could see that in his dead, blank eyes.

&#34;Show me.&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m sorry, what?&#34;

&#34;I want to see how the &#39;gun&#39; works.&#34;

Yeah, the skeleton took the bait. Joe was fine, all he had to do was show the immense power of that shotgun on a bunch of snow golems or something. The money was guaranteed. Joe gestured to the back of the stand and asked the knight to follow him. Still inside, he quickly put on a random pair of pants to hide his flower-stamped shorts, but still had his sandals on. Passing through the back door, he loaded two shells in the gun and tried his best to remember how to create an animated snowman.

The knight stood silently watching the short businessman wave his right hand and whisper random words, as the tiny snow hills spread across the frozen lake started to twist, rise and combine, becoming vaguely humanoid statues. Inanimate, of course, as Joe did not remember how to properly perform the ritual. He pointed the shotgun at the piles of snow, took a deep breath and pressed the trigger.

&#34;Fuck. Shit.&#34; Nothing happened. He looked at the skeleton and nervously chuckled, &#34;it&#39;s probably because of the time...&#34;

He pressed the trigger again. The snowmen remained intact. The knight started to grunt from inside his translucent helmet. Joe smiled again, sweating and shaking. He remembered the red gem was in his pocket. There were only two options: make the gun work or get out of the area. He pressed the trigger again, but still, nothing happened.

Joe looked to the warrior, who already had his hand on the frozen hilt of the ice sword. &#34;Fuck. Shit.&#34; He stepped back as soon as the skeleton waved the blade in the direction of the poorly dressed man.

&#34;You vermin!&#34; shouted the skeleton, holding his sword firmly. &#34;You will pay for your crimes!&#34;

&#34;Crimes?&#34; Joe desperately slapped the gun in his hands in an attempt to fix it. &#34;My business is legitimate! My products are not only of the finest quality but they are also verified on a monthly basis by the General Inspection Fleet of the United Planets of...&#34;

The warrior tried to slash Joe&#39;s arm, who avoided any major damage. The sleeve of his suit, on the other hand, suffered quite a bit.

&#34;You sell rubbish to my brothers! You try to sell the same rubbish to the chief of the Queen&#39;s Royal Guard! You will pay, with your human blood!&#34; The animated skull&#39;s eyes started to go from a light blue to a deep purple as it got filled with rage. Charging one last time at Joe, the pile of bones collapsed to the ground, as the remains of the skull and the ice helmet that was over it flew above the frozen lake.

Joe fell to the ground as the weapon fired. He looked at the defeated knight, and then at the barrel of the gun, from where a faint smoke was rising. The man breathed heavily as he tried to recompose himself, standing up quickly and still staring at the scene. He put his hand inside the pocket of his suit, taking the little gem out of it. That situation could have gone better. Joe looked at the remains of the warrior once more, then he looked at the massive ice castle in the distance and then at the gem again.

&#34;Fuck. Shit.&#34; He had to leave. Joe returned to his shack, threw the gun in a corner, gently placed the gem into a ring box, pressed the big red button on the middle of the west wall and stepped out of the area again. He watched as his establishment started to contort itself and shrink, while he glanced at the snowy mountains in the distance, the frozen spikes in the ceiling of the cave and at the imposing ice structure one last time.

He walked up to his small wooden box surrounded by colorful runes, picked it up, put in his pant&#39;s pocket and pressed the button on his wristwatch. &#34;I&#39;ll miss this place,&#34; Joe thought to himself, as his body started to become a cloud of dust that would soon fly away from that moon.

------

Lizzie took another sip of her beer as the crowd passed by her. &#34;Damn, this is really good.&#34;

&#34;For some  reason, I don&#39;t think this is good in terms of quality, but it definitely tastes better than that shit they serve in the Station...&#34; Nick said, simply spinning the cup in his hand.

&#34;Come on, scout, cheer up! We got the best job we could in this festival, all we have to do is relax and, once in a while, look around.&#34;

&#34;I guess... This thing is still too loud for my taste, though.&#34;

Io&#39;s Festival of the Dead, that happened twice a year, was known all around the Solar System for its music, specially. The inhabitants of the moon could make a pleasant sound with almost anything, from five-handed trumpets to pieces of rock. Although the songs were good, they were indeed very loud. The warm desert where the city of Navdahiir was located was also famous for their mercury storms. Alchemists frequently gather outside the walls of the town to collect the rare metal, but the mayor charged a large amount of money for that.

As time passed and the bands got further away from the cops, Nick started to get comfortable again, but he still had barely touched his drink.

&#34;Ah please, scout! You can&#39;t beat yourself up forever, he would have to go sooner or later.&#34; Lizzie was the best at saying the wrong thing at the worst time possible.

&#34;But he was my best friend! And he was so young, man...&#34;

&#34;Yeah, but he was just a cat, you know? They are not immune to diseases.&#34;

&#34;He fell in the trash disposal unit...&#34;

&#34;Oh. Oh yeah, that&#39;s right. Sorry, buddy.&#34;

&#34;Whatever.&#34;

They remained silent for a few seconds, until a loud buzz came from Lizzie&#39;s radio, followed by the deep voice of their boss.

&#34;Change of plans, folks. We have a Red Beacon coming from Callisto, and as you are the closest, I want you both to go take a look. Report after getting there. Over.&#34;

Lizzie sighed as the radio got silent. Party time was over, but maybe a little action could cheer up her partner.

&#34;Let&#39;s get out of here, Nick. Time to talk to those crazy bones again.&#34;

Nick grunted as he stood up, left a bunch of coins on the counter and walked with Lizzie to their car.

------

Joe opened his eyes and took a deep breath, tripping and falling on the stairs of the postal service station of Vri&#39;il Amagur. Some of the local incorporeal guards looked at him with suspicion, but didn&#39;t move, taking the man for a random junkie playing with broken teleportation devices. Joe stood up quickly, looked around and then ran to a nearby alley. 

He had a pretty rough journey, and as he looked at his wristwatch, he noticed some cracks on the glass that definitely weren&#39;t there before. As he checked his own body, he soon realized the absence of one of his sandals, a chunk of his hair and, more importantly, the middle finger of his left hand. No blood was coming out of the hole, though, and he felt no pain, so he just put a piece of cloth over it and got out of the alley.

&#34;Europa,&#34; thought Joe, looking at the tall stone buildings and Jupiter, that stood graciously beyond the satellite where he found himself at that moment. Before getting into the crowd that passed on the sidewalk, he checked his temperature regulator on the only middle finger he had left and adjusted his red striped tie. There was a lot of work to do.

------

&#34;So, what the hell happened here?&#34; Lizzie leaned on the floating vehicle, looking at the remains of the skeleton.

&#34;Human named... Joe. Sell rubbish to the people of the Queen, murder the chief of the guard, steal blood gem and disappear. The Queen wants his head.&#34; One of the warriors around the crime scene tried to turn off the beacon, clearly having trouble to press the only button on the machine.

Those piles of bones rarely asked for help from the Station, mostly because Gdu&#39; Gnar was frozen both physically and in time. That kingdom was at war with the giant ice worms of Callisto for centuries, and many of them died every second, but if they called the Station&#39;s Security Body to investigate a single death, it surely had to mean something big was going on. Lizzie leaned down and started checking the area, looking for any trace of the murderer.

Among the pieces of bone and ice, she quickly noticed the small lead balls scattered around the place. &#34;Shotgun. Very old,&#34; she thought, taking one of the objects and examining it closely.

&#34;Where did you say he lived again?&#34; she asked, still looking for more clues around the frozen lake.

&#34;Wooden structure. Big bright letters. Here on the shore of the lake.&#34; The warrior finally made the machine stop emitting its light, standing up and looking at the cop right after.

&#34;I see. Nick, take a look around, Conversion Boxes usually leave some traces behind.&#34;

She was still thinking about what device the criminal used to transport his body. Functional personal teleporters were either too expansive or had severe side effects. If she had luck, that man went for the second option, and that probably meant he...

&#34;Nailed it.&#34; Lizzie picked up the severed finger and the chunk of hair, put them in individual plastic bags. &#34;Scout, found something?&#34;

&#34;No luck. You?&#34;

&#34;Yeah, we have everything we need right here.&#34; She turned to the group of knights before entering the car with her partner. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll get this guy.&#34;

Closing the door and taking off, Nick turned to Lizzie with a hopeful look in his eyes. &#34;Where now?&#34;

&#34;The Station.&#34; She looked carefully at that finger inside the bag, wondering about who could be its owner. &#34;This little gold mine will give us a name, a face and, hopefully, an address.&#34;

------

&#34;Protective necklaces! Protective necklaces! Wear one of these and prevent ghosts from haunting you!&#34;

&#34;Come, come! This wonderful machine can refine even the sturdiest minerals out there!&#34;

&#34;Hey, lady, want to get your face stamped on a shirt? I&#39;ll get that done for you, I went to North Badgus&#39; Art School!&#34;

&#34;Amateurs,&#34; Joe thought to himself, while trying to cover the empty space in the middle of his hair. &#34;I need only one stupid rich asshole and an old piece of paper to make a thousand gold pieces.&#34;

Joe turned on his personal beer brewing machine as he started to spread some of his items on the front counter of his stand. Vri&#39;il Amagur&#39;s Central Plaza was perfect for him. As it was located in the middle of the Corporative District, the passage of at least one company owner was guaranteed. He kept his eyes opened while the other salespeople shouted random words to draw any attention they possibly could.

The man still breathed heavily from his journey. He knew he should have just bought a Telewatch, instead of searching for one in the dumpster of a factory of the company. Still, it was better than nothing. Golems, alchemists and businessmen passed his stand, but none of them seemed like a good target. Joe looked at the back of his store for a moment, glancing the small black box that held his gem, and then back to the fountain of the plaza. He was officially a criminal, but he couldn&#39;t go back, he was too close to the big score for that.

&#34;Hello, ma&#39;am, do you have a second?&#34; That should be easy. That woman was flipping through notes that were obviously filled with numbers, and Joe had the perfect product for her.

&#34;I am kind of in a hurry, actually.&#34;

&#34;I promise you will not regret this! Have you ever had problems with fast calculus?&#34;

&#34;I... Actually, yes, I&#39;ve had.&#34;

&#34;Then it is your lucky day! This little guy right here, &#39;Calculatron&#39;, as they are called in the market, can easily do that for you! Activated by vocal commands, these machines will become your best friends when dealing with extensive numbers in your business!&#34;

------

&#34;Joe Polinsky?&#34; Lizzie shouted in disbelief.

&#34;Yeah... Do you know the guy?&#34; Nick closed the door to the Body&#39;s lab behind him, looking confused to his partner.

&#34;Fuck me! I shared a place with him when I was still a cashier at that supermarket in the Lower Station.&#34;

&#34;So? It will be easier to catch him if you know how he behaves, right?&#34;

&#34;I guess so, yeah. That asshole had his little tricks since then. His &#39;job&#39; was to collect random broken artifacts around and either using them for his own gain or selling them for three times what they were actually worth. That little weasel does not give up on his stupid ideas and he can definitely get trick you. Now even I want his head on a silver platter.&#34;

&#34;Okay, but we have a name and a face, we just need the address.&#34;

&#34;Well, if he used one of those watches to move around, which is my guess based on the way he is, he could have only travelled to one of the Galilean moons. As he left Callisto, he could be in any of the other three.&#34;

&#34;Shit. Well, let&#39;s talk to the big chief before we head out, he might have some info on the case for us.&#34;

The duo walked through the white corridors of the Middle Station, passing through some windows that let them see Saturn and Jupiter well. They quickly went down the stairs and finally entered the office where their superior was in.

&#34;Sir, we just received...&#34;

&#34;Europa. Vri&#39;il Amagur. Postal guards just spotted an odd guy that luckily matches the results from the lab. Go get him, tigers.&#34;

&#34;Yes sir,&#34; both said, before leaving the room and running to the hangar of the area.

------

&#34;It was a pleasure to do business with you, sir!&#34; Joe shouted with a smile, counting the dozens of gold coins he received for selling an old pair of glasses to a mass of meat and eyes. The interaction was certainly odd, but if he could make money out of it, he wouldn&#39;t complain.

Things were going great. A few more months of that and he could finally buy Amalthea, and probably build a mansion there, with a massive biodome, a pool in the interior, and golden cars and...

&#34;Good morning, sir,&#34; said a strange figure, wearing sunglasses and a large grey coat. &#34;I heard you give the best solutions to the worst problems, is that true?&#34;

&#34;Uh... yes. Yes ma&#39;am! It is! And what would your issue be?&#34; Joe stood up from his stall with a jump, interested in what that person had to offer for his services.

&#34;You see, I need to find a person, but all I know is his name.&#34; Lizzie looked to her right, watching her partner get behind the stands, with his taser in hands.

&#34;Hm... Ah! You know what, I might have exactly what you need! Give me a moment...&#34; Joe looked desperately for the old compass he found two weeks before that moment, hoping the woman could give him at least one hundred pieces for it. &#34;Found it! Now this, this is the &#39;Locator of Norvathur&#39;. Just give it a name and it will point exactly in the direction of that entity. So, who were you looking for again?&#34;

&#34;Ah, just a little someone named... Joe. Joe Polinsky.&#34;

&#34;Fuck. Shit.&#34; He knew that moment would come, but he didn&#39;t expected it to be that soon. Joe had to think fast, his guns were not close, but his knife was taped under the top of the counter. If he could only...

&#34;Joe Polinsky, under the jurisdiction of the United Solar Planets&#39; Space Station, you are under arrest for extortion, theft and murder. You have ten minutes to surrender or we will use non-lethal force against you well-being.&#34;

&#34;Fuck. Shit.&#34; He had to escape. No matter what, he had to leave the place, even if it meant leaving his gem behind. Without even thinking, Joe closed his eyes, reached his broken wristwatch and...

&#34;Shit.&#34; Lizzie was stunned. Who would have thought that shocking a man as he was about to be teleported could result in such a gruesome scene? There was nothing more than a pile of blood, teeth, hair and bones left.

Nick looked at the result of his actions for about five minutes, before turning around and throwing up on the floor. He left the store and tried to catch his breath outside, while his partner went around the place to look for the stolen item.

&#34;Are you okay?&#34; She asked, stopping right next to the disturbed man.

&#34;I&#39;ll... I&#39;ll be fine. Just go, let&#39;s get out of here.&#34;

She entered the weird place, full of old objects, and started looking around. It didn&#39;t take long for her to spot the tiny box on the middle of a shelf. Opening it, Lizzie saw the magnificent red crystal, and confirmed their job was done. Leaving the area again, with the object in her pocket, she grabbed her radio and pressed the small button on the side.

&#34;Sir, mission accomplished. Uh... I think you will have to bring a clean up crew here, though, we made quite the mess.&#34;

&#34;Roger that, come back here before anything. Over.&#34;

Lizzie put her hand on Nick&#39;s shoulder, looking at him firmly.

&#34;Hey.&#34;

&#34;Hey...&#34;

&#34;So... did you get over that cat situation? I mean, this is definitely way worse, right?&#34;

&#34;Fuck you, Liz.&#34;</textarea></pre>
