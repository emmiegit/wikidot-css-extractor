You didn&#39;t look like yourself 
when I saw you in your coffin.
You looked like someone understood 
the vague idea of you.
But not really you.


I leaned down to kiss your forehead, 
like I had many times when you were still alive.

They never tell you how cold corpses are.
But it only makes sense.
They&#39;re no longer alive.
No heart a beat-beat-beating.
No blood a pump-pump-pumping.

I saw family and friends.
People I had never met.
Distant cousins.
Neighbors from Havana.
Even your doctor.

The priest gave a eulogy
and invited us to give a speech.
I wanted to 
but found myself lacking the words.

A big nasty knot formed in my throat
But no tears fell
As you were lowered into the ground.

On the drive home, I played your favorite song.
The one we used to dance to when I was a kid
The one I played to you on your deathbed to comfort you.

As I got home I went to your room
And I realized it was empty.
No oxygen machine beeping.
No fan quietly spinning.
Quiet.

And then I realized
That was what my life would become.
Quiet.

No more sleeping at your side to make sure you didn&#39;t fall out of bed.
No more blood pressure machines.
No more oxygen masks.
Just
Quiet.
