**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5893-1 to SCP-5893-22 are to be kept in a 2km² forested enclosure in Area-5893. The enclosure must not be roofed or floored[[footnote]]This prevents SCP-5893 specimens from becoming stressed or agitated due to unfamiliar surroundings or feelings of imprisonment.[[/footnote]] and must be surrounded by tungsten carbide walls which are 2m tall and 1m thick. Additionally, 5m wide firebreaks are to be positioned along the edges of the enclosure.

SCP-5893 instances are to not be provoked or stressed under any circumstance. When approaching an SCP-5893 specimen, no loud sounds, abrupt movements, or threatening gestures are to be made.

In the case of a containment breach, a Collaborative Task Force consisting of 25 total members of MTF Epsilon-9 (&#34;Fire Breathers&#34;) and MTF Phi-2 (&#34;Clever Girls&#34;) - designated CTF Psi-29 (&#34;Pyroraptors&#34;) - is to be deployed. This squadron - specialized in dealing with prehistoric anomalies in high-temperature environments - is tasked with the sedation and re-capturing of SCP-5893 specimens by the use of Xylazine[[footnote]]Analogue used for sedation, anesthesia, muscle relaxation, and analgesia.[[/footnote]]. No specimens are to be neutralized during these operations.

**Description:** SCP-5893 is a herd of specimens that closely resemble the species //Stygimoloch spinifer//[[footnote]]Meaning &#34;Demon of Styx river&#34;.[[/footnote]]. Although being similar from a skeletal level, SCP-5893 instances possess several biological differences and properties which divide them from the latter.

The herd consists of 5 male and 17 female specimens, SCP-5893 instances are designated from SCP-5893-1 to SCP-5893-22 respectively.  SCP-5893 specimens are bipedal ornithischian[[footnote]]&#34;Bird-hipped&#34;.[[/footnote]] dinosaurs of the clade //Pachycephalosauria//[[footnote]]Meaning &#34;Thick-headed lizards.[[/footnote]]. SCP-5893 specimens are herbivores. 

SCP-5893 instances have an average lifespan of 25 years and have an average height of 1m, an approximate length of 2.5 to 3.3m, and a mass of 90 to 110kg. The hatching period for SCP-5893 specimens is between 6 to 8 months.

Although normally peaceful, SCP-5893 specimens can ignite their body without the use of incendiary compounds or chemicals to reach temperatures of up to 3,500 °C when they are threatened or stressed. SCP-5893 specimens primarily employ this property as a self-defense mechanism although they have been seen to engage in aggressive behavior against their attacker(s) in rare instances. Upon cooling, SCP-5893 instances release very high levels of Carbon dioxide (CO,,2,,) into the atmosphere through the use of special tube-like organs. These organs are located in two rows of five throughout their back.

SCP-5893 specimens are not affected on a respiratory or dermatological level by any of these properties, nor are they harmed by smoke inhalation or burns caused by outside factors.

The majority of SCP-5893 fossils have been unearthed in Hell&#39;s Creek, Montana, with more small pockets of fossils appearing in varied zones leading up to Ennis, Montana. This discovery would indicate migratory behavior from the SCP-5893 herd.

**Note:** It is not yet understood how the SCP-5893 herd was able to survive the mass extinction which took place in the Cretaceous period; however Foundation paleontologists have theorized that the heat manipulation properties present in SCP-5893 specimens would have allowed them to survive the initial blast as well as maintain body heat during the subsequent ice age.

**Discovery:** The herd of SCP-5893 specimens was discovered in the town of Ennis, Montana, United States, after the former suffered a massive fire that destroyed most of the community. Foundation operatives initiated vigilance of the town after reports of &#34;lizard-like horned creatures&#34; surfaced from members of the community as an explanation for the fire. 

After 5 days of monitoring, the herd of SCP-5893 instances was located, captured, and subsequently transported to Area-5893. A disinformation campaign describing the event as a fire caused by faulty wiring at the local library was launched. Additionally, all witnesses were administered Class C amnestics.
-----
**Addendum 5893.1:** The following diary was recovered from 11-year old Timmothy Piers after it was discovered to contain information about the SCP-5893 herd.

Below are all the entries detailing encounters with SCP-5893 instances.

Today I woke up at 7:AM. It was a sunny day, I went to look out my window like usual when I saw something terrifying. It was this huge lizard, with horns and big spikes coming out of its back. I was shocked so I just stood there looking. It ran away before I could tell anyone what had happened.

Today I went to a restaurant with my family. We ate some tasty food and we decided to sit near the corner of the place, I could see the forest through the window. I was looking through the window when I saw it, deep in the forest.
@@ @@
I only got a quick glimpse before it left but it looked bigger? Maybe it had eaten something?
I&#39;m not sure how it got bigger so quickly.
@@ @@
Anyways, I think it may have seen me. It was looking towards the restaurant at least. If it was going to attack the town it probably would have done it a long time ago so I think it&#39;s peaceful.
@@ @@
I&#39;ve decided I&#39;m going to go into the forest and find it. This time I&#39;ll get close to it.

I asked my parents if I could go to the forest to try to look for animals. I know it&#39;s a lie but imagine how they would react if I told them I was demon hunting. They said no though. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to see the demon if they won&#39;t let me go into the forest.
@@ @@
I have to come up with a plan.

I just snuck out of the house with a lantern and my diary to take notes if the demon tells me anything. I&#39;m writing this as I&#39;m going to see it. I made sure to be as quiet as possible but when I closed the door I think I heard a door upstairs open. Hopefully, my parents didn&#39;t hear anything.

I&#39;ve searched the whole forest. I went through the back of my house and to where I last saw the demon but... I can&#39;t find it.
@@ @@
I&#39;m thinking of giving up. It&#39;s late.
@@ @@
I&#39;ll go back to my home. I&#39;m just not finding anything.

I was walking back home when I passed a place where I had seen the demon a few times and... this time I managed to find it. I was getting close to it very slowly, I didn&#39;t want to make it angry. 
@@ @@
I tried to speak to the demon but it just stood there. Like it was inspecting me.
@@ @@
Then, out of nowhere, my dad came running to me. He was yelling my name. He saw my light and heard me going out so he went running after me.
@@ @@
He reached where we were and he just stood there in shock. He looked at the demon and screamed.
@@ @@
The demon roared, all of a sudden it burst on fire and started running away from us, towards the town...
@@ @@
Then out of the forest came running a ton of them, there were about 20 I could count. They all burst into flames as well, I nearly went blind. They all ran after the first one, it was like a stampede.
@@ @@
Was it a horde all along?
@@ @@
We just stood there for a second trying to process what had happened before running back into town. I could see the lights. The demons were already in, and the whole town was on fire.
@@ @@
People were screaming and I and my dad went running to our house, my mom and sister were outside. They were also in shock at what they were seeing.
@@ @@
My dad told my mom what was happening and told her to get her things, we had to leave town quickly before the fire got to us.
@@ @@
I managed to rip a few pages from my diary and grab what was in my backpack and got in the car just as one of the demons ran headfirst into my house and it all started to burn. 
@@ @@
I&#39;m writing this while my dad drives the car, I don&#39;t know where we&#39;re going but it&#39;ll be some time before we come back. The whole town is destroyed.

[[size 120%]]Do they know?
@@ @@
My dad&#39;s been silent this whole drive. He hasn&#39;t even looked back at me or talked to my mom.
@@ @@
Does he know?
@@ @@
Does he think it was my fault for sneaking out? Or is it his fault for making the horde of demons angry?
@@ @@
What even were they I don&#39;t know. Will I ever know? Were they actually demons?
@@ @@
Do they have anything to do with the fires? Did they cause the huge fires all across Montana?
@@ @@
Should I have told someone about it? Maybe it would have prevented this.
@@ @@
I&#39;m looking back at the town. The trees are burning. The fire is spreading. Soon the forest will be red...
@@ @@
I just hope everyone made it out alive...
