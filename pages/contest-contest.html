[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
Ever wanted to run a contest? Now, you can. Well, you could before, too. Anyone can post a contest hub at any time. There is no rule explicitly preventing this. There is no written policy page for rules regarding contest hubs, as far as I can tell. I didn&#39;t have a ton of time to research. 

**HOWEVER:** I am legally[[footnote]]morally[[/footnote]] obligated to inform you that you //should not// attempt to run any sort of unofficial contest without speaking to the Community Outreach Team first. They would //really prefer// you didn&#39;t attempt to run a contest without their approval. I don&#39;t think they&#39;d stop you, but many of the things you&#39;d want to do in order to run a serious, quality contest cannot be done without their assistance and oversight.

Anyway. Point is, you could have run a contest before and you didn&#39;t. But now, some funny man whose name is literally placeholder is saying you can do it //competitively//. And there&#39;s no way you&#39;re turning that down. I mean, you&#39;ve participated in worse contests. 

Come on, don&#39;t lie to me, I know you have. I&#39;m scrubbing through your wikidot user history right now. //Memecon? Really?// Like anything good was going to come out of that.[[footnote]]:teemo:

= **How to Enter CONTEST CONTEST**

**1.** Within the duration from 12:01 AM EST 6 January 2023 to 11:59 PM EST 12 January 2023, post a page to the SCP Wiki which
* successfully qualifies for the {{contest}} tag, and
* still exists at 12:01 AM EST 20 January 2023.

**2.** Due to the nature of the **CONTEST CONTEST**, we will unfortunately not be allowing art entries. Like, not just visual art -- //no// art, at all. Your entry must not include anything artistic. Your entry can //be// an Art Contest, though, that&#39;s fine! Oh yeah, and, no {{theme}} or {{component}} pages as entries either. Apologies for the confusion.

+ __RULES__

**1.** Highest-rated **CONTEST CONTEST** entry at **RESULTS DECIDED** time wins. (Visual) Art Contest entries are a separate category with a separate winner because purely visual art is fundamentally different from all other artforms and cannot be compared with them. All non-Art Contests are in the same category, though.

**2.** The following statement must appear at the top of your entry, right below your rating module:

**3.** You are permitted to edit your **CONTEST CONTEST** entry, but not wholly replace it. Although you are allowed to add and remove sections to your **CONTEST CONTEST** entry, ultimately the central idea of your **CONTEST CONTEST** entry should remain the same. This also means that any edits that would comprehensively replace or overwrite your original **CONTEST CONTEST** entry will be prohibited. In the case of having a **CONTEST CONTEST** entry with planned updates or something similar that we have seen in prior contests, a full and thorough outline of said updates must be presented to a **CONTEST CONTEST** marshal before the end of the posting period. This is to help ensure that **CONTEST CONTEST** contestants are given the freedom to be creative with their **CONTEST CONTEST** entries while at the same time preventing the possibility of some **CONTEST CONTEST** contestants being able to obtain &#34;additional time&#34; to work on their **CONTEST CONTEST** entry after the end of the posting period. If unsure over whether an edit would violate these terms, please consult the following flowchart.

+ __TAGGING__

Since this page is my ColdpostCon Entry, I was unable to have it reviewed by Community Outreach and, as such, could not arrange creation of the {{contestcontest}} tag prior to **CONTEST CONTEST**. So just do whatever&#39;s required to obtain the regular ol&#39; {{contest}} tag on your entry. 

Since I can&#39;t use Listpages to target only contest pages created between certain dates, they won&#39;t be listed here unless I edit the page, which I&#39;m not allowed to do until ColdpostCon has concluded. So, on 12 January, between the end of ColdpostCon&#39;s Voting Period and the end of **CONTEST CONTEST**&#39;s Posting Period, I&#39;ll update this page to reflect all the **CONTEST CONTEST** entries! The entries currently on this page are placeholders[[footnote]]HAHAHAHA LMAO LOL HAHA HE SAID IT HE SAID THE THING OH MY FUCKING GOD I AM ROLLING ON THE FLOOR LAUGHING MY ASS OFF HE SAID IT HE SAID HIS NAME BUT HIS NAME IS A WORD AND HE USED IT AS A WORD INSTEAD OF USING IT AS HIS NAME WHICH IS HAHAHA IT&#39;S FUNNY DON&#39;T YOU UNDERSTAND DON&#39;T YOU GET IT IT&#39;S SO FUCKING FUNNY MY STOMACH HURTS HAHAHAHA LMAO LOL LMAO I THINK HAHA THAT MAYBE HAHA LOL MY APPENDIX JUST BURST HAHAHA XD PLACEHOLDER MCD WHAT A FUNNY GUY PFFT I JUST CAN&#39;T TAKE IT ANYMORE LOL XD[[/footnote]] to entertain you until then.
