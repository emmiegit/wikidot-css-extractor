**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-????-J&#39;s box is currently kept in a containment cell 200m x 200m x 200m in size. SCP-????-J&#39;s box is comprised of multiple layers of tele-kill shielding, tantalum hafnium carbide, an outer layer of a graphene/carbyne lattice, and decorated with a vantablack floral stencil pattern.

[[include component:image-block name=vanta|caption=Artist&#39;s rendering of the box&#39;s intricate surface ornamentation]]

This container is locked with multiple redundant locking mechanisms that are presumed to decrease the likelihood of unauthorized access. These locks are labelled --SCP-????-Box-A through, uh, shit,--  SCP-????-Box-1 through SCP-????-Box---41-- --46-- --50-- fuck it idk, the locks are—are all SCP-????-Box-1. It&#39;s a—what do you call it—collective designation. They materialize and dematerialize in random intervals but only one manifests at a time. When inactive, the box appears as a 1m^^3^^ sheen black cube, bearing a single hinged compartment.

**Description:** SCP-????-J is the designation for an anomaly of unknown specification, currently locked in this fucking box. It&#39;s been in Site-44 for as long as anyone can remember, and, I&#39;m gonna level with you, //no one knows where the fuck it came from//. It&#39;s stuck inside with a bazillion gizmos, and they all show up randomly on the sides of the box. Anything—keypads, combination locks, time-based Sudoku puzzles—you name it. The thing is locked --tighter than Clef&#39;s butthole--. 

SCP-????-J&#39;s condition was brought to the attention of Site-44 director Yanni Belushi when O5-1 pointed the box out during a leisurely stroll through the facility. The conversation is transcribed below:

&gt; = **SCP-????-J Discovery Transcript Log:**
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; = &lt;BEGIN TRANSCRIPT&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-1:** Oi, what the fuck is that thing?
&gt; 
&gt; **Belushi:** What, that? It&#39;s been around here for god knows how long. It&#39;s just a box, I think.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-1:** There are no &#39;just boxes&#39; in the Foundation. That thing probably has an Apollyon in it, lock that shit down.
&gt; 
&gt; **Belushi:** Yeah, you&#39;re probably right. Guard!
&gt; 
&gt; **Guard:** What&#39;s up, Belush?
&gt; 
&gt; **Belushi:** Don&#39;t call me that, that&#39;s not my name. Get this box out of here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Guard:** What, should I throw it in the trash?
&gt; 
&gt; **Belushi:** No, you moron, put it in a containment cell. Who knows what is inside the thing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Guard:** I dunno, Belush, the thing feels empty.
&gt; 
&gt; **Belushi:** I said //don&#39;t. Fucking. Call me that.// And stop rattling it around, you might piss off whatever is in there.
&gt; 
&gt; **Guard:** I&#39;m telling you mate, this box is totally empty.
&gt; 
&gt; **Belushi:** And I&#39;m telling //you//, put that box in a bigger box or else I&#39;ll shove my foot so far up //your// box that you&#39;ll be having infant-sized Dockers in nine months.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-1:** Jesus.
&gt; 
&gt; **Guard:** Alright! Calm your tits, man. Sheesh. 
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-????-J&#39;s box was then transported to its current containment area. Guard was reprimanded and probably demoted, jackass.//

We weren&#39;t sure if the box was safe to open for the longest time, we still don&#39;t know for sure, but like five years ago—after the old Administrator kicked it—the story goes that the Council was divvying up his stuff and O5-4 kept going on about how the late Admin borrowed his signed region-free copy of the //Fringe: The Complete Series// Blu-ray box set back in like &#39;14 and hadn&#39;t returned it, and that it was odd the old man&#39;s DVD collection hadn&#39;t been recovered with any of his effects nor from his numerous [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3311 storage units],[[footnote]]Ohhh yeah, you remember that whole thing? Turned out the previous Administrator was three chairs in a trenchcoat, disguised as a human. What, they never told you that? Oh—oh, right. [speaking into wrist] ^^,,//I&#39;m gonna need some Class-B amnestics to Site-44, sublevel 18, room 7A—//,,^^ What? No you&#39;re fine. Just stay right here.[[/footnote]] then they found some ledger of the Admin&#39;s with &#34;OPEN [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/qntm-s-proposal THE LOCK], ENACT EVIL CHAIR AGENDA&#34; scribbled in one of the margins, so O5-1 mentioned SCP-????-J&#39;s container and then they got this idea they were somehow referring to the same thing and maybe SCP-????-J&#39;s box had a bunch of Blu-ray disks inside.

So we started opening the box for them, or doing our best to. Then like last year, O5-4 finds his boxed set of //Fringe// in his basement, behind his dehumidifier or whatever, and left us to figuring out the nature of SCP-????-J ever since.

Anyway, we are making progress. Probably. Every time we solve something, or we think we do, the box makes this tone and we never see that specific //bastard// lock again. I think it&#39;s working. Some of them have timers on their sides, counting down. Sometimes a little instruction is scribbled on the exterior of the box, most often written in black permanent marker, which is, you know, an absolute pain. Most often, though, we&#39;re in the dark. If it weren&#39;t for some clues, we&#39;d be going nowhere. How else would we have known you had to send it a fax? //A fax?!// Who faxes shit anymore? What is this, 1870? 

A full list of all these goddamn locking mechanisms are found here.
