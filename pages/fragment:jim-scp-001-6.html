    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Item #:**  SCP-001

**Object Class:**  Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:**  N/A

**Description:**  Ah, yes, hello, I&#39;m back again.  Sorry about that.  You know how it is.

So.

As I am quite certain you have already guessed, I have not, in fact, been 100% truthful this whole time.  Not even when I said I was going to be.  I&#39;m sorry about that too.  Though I have to say that, given the varying nature of our relationship over the years, I hardly expect that a single Foundation employee that&#39;s been reading this has believed a word of it anyway.  What reason have I given any of you to believe anything I have to say, after all?  None, I suppose.

So the question, then, is why would I even bother doing this?  Since I don&#39;t even expect you to believe me, why try?  Because . . . well, because I //like// you, SCP Foundation.  I also hate you, and am indifferent to you, and I wish you would stop meddling in my affairs, and I&#39;m glad you take the time to care about my customers&#39; safety the way you do.

You see?  It&#39;s complicated.  But after all the time we&#39;ve been frenemies, I feel you deserve at least a little something that lets you put a few of the pieces of the &#34;Dr. Wondertainment&#34; puzzle together.  Not the //whole// truth, perhaps, but still, something real.

You see, I am all of the things I have said.

I am also none of them.

And, perhaps most truthful of all . . . I have no idea what I am anymore.

It feels like it&#39;s important, doesn&#39;t it?  To mold everything around you into easily understandable shapes.  It&#39;s what you lot try to do all the time, of course, both the Foundation specifically and the human race in general.  And I know why you do it, believe me.  A lack of understanding is a very dangerous thing.  Entire civilizations have been swallowed up whole by their own ignorance.  And so you keep on drawing patterns across the universe to keep the howling madness of your surroundings at bay.

And there is a part of me that wishes I could do the same for myself.  That wishes I could wind everything about myself down into a single thread.  It would not only make things easier for you, it would undoubtedly save me a great deal of stress as well, let me tell you.  How different things would be if I just knew for absolute certain that I am a magician obsessed with making toys, or an amoral businessman seeking the bottom line, or an heiress with cartoonish superpowers, or a god of thunder and chaos, or just a simple tinkerer plying his trade in an attempt to bring a little bit of magic back into the world.

But it&#39;s only one part of me that wants that certitude.  There is another part, you see.  A part that wants to show you that understanding a thing isn&#39;t supposed to be about containing the parts of it that you don&#39;t get yet.  That wants to make you realize that understanding a thing on its own terms and not just strictly yours can lead you to a world of beauty, delight, and wonder.

It&#39;s a small but important voice in my head that speaks to me with a child-like sense of awe and curiosity.  And when it looks out at everything I&#39;ve done and everything that I am, it smiles, laughs brightly, and asks . . .

&#34;But what are you going to be //next?//&#34;

I invite you to come along with me, SCP Foundation.

Let&#39;s find out together.</textarea></pre>
