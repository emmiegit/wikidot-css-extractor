**Item #:** SCP-6176

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Wing G of Site-301 has been converted to act as SCP-6176&#39;s primary containment chamber, currently a 4.5m wide cube-shaped room, initially intended to act as a supply room for janitorial staff. Organic personnel are not permitted to enter wing G. Instead, Kederesk.aic has been assigned to monitor and report on SCP-6176.

[[include component:image-block
| name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/bread-tyrant-authorpage/distorted_doctor_care| caption=Dr. Carè after exposure to D-2133 (SCP-6176)]]

**Description:** SCP-6176 is a [[[SCP-2470|specific existential]]], metaphysical construct or entity currently maintained in wing G at Site-301.

SCP-6176 is a metaphysical embodiment of its metaphysical self, which has produced an intense feedback loop in which SCP-6176 continuously reiterates itself. This process is indefinite as long as SCP-6176 remains conceptually alive. This is due to SCP-6176 being capable of visualising how subjects externally perceive itself, which inturn alters its own metaphysical self, which results in the feedback loop. SCP-6176 invariably becomes inert once it no longer becomes subjectively perceived by an organic individual. 

Due to external perception of it, SCP-6176 primarily has taken a humanoid shape. Whether SCP-6176 in this state is conscious is still unknown, as external perception doesn&#39;t lead to change in SCP-6176 internally. However, if an iteration of SCP-6176 is produced off the basis of a hominid-centred perception, then it is likely SCP-6176 has manifested some form of consciousness. SCP-6176 iterations that are likely to be conscious are designated as SCP-6176-Prime instances. While the exact parameters for a prime instance are unclear, the Foundation has documented the appearance of 4 prime instances which have come about since SCP-6176&#39;s containment in 1972.

**Addendum-1:** Several tests were performed on SCP-6176 to see its reactions to external perception of it based on different states of consciousness.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]
**Conscious State:** Waking
**Subject:** D-4972

**Result:** SCP-6176 performed as was expected, in which a humanoid shape was formed during the subsequent iterations. No prime instances were produced.
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]
**Conscious State:** Sleeping
**Subject:** D-4972

**Result:** No result, as D-4972 did not visually perceive SCP-6176.
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]
**Conscious State:** Dreaming
**Subject:** D-2133

//D-2133 was exposed to several images relating to SCP-6176, symbolic and metaphorical in nature. D-2133 was also allowed to converse with D-4972 regarding SCP-6176 before the test was conducted.//

**Result:** SCP-6176 formed a humanoid shape which assumed the supine position. D-2133 proceeded to open their eyes, however was in a paralytic state. SCP-6176 formed superficial eyes which rapidly looked around before they formed into three images.

The first featured a young boy sitting beside an older woman in a hospital bed hooked up to a breathing apparatus.

The second featured the same young boy pulling away the blinds of a window at several other children playing basketball in the street.

The third featured the young boy in a suit and tie sitting at the bottom of a wooden staircase, crying into their hands.
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]
**Conscious State:** Transcendental Consciousness
**Subject:** D-4972 and D-2133

**Result:** SCP-6176 formed several hominid-centred conceptual identifiers present within the noosphere, specifically ones which relate to both D-4972 and D-2133. Notable examples were: names, memories, aspirations and personalities.
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]
**Conscious State:** Cosmic Consciousness
**Subject:** D-4972 and D-2133

**Result:** SCP-6176 formed a brain, with several roots growing from its base. This was followed by the manifestation of several symbolic images, which were incomprehensible to D-4972 and D-2133.
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]
**Conscious State:** God Consciousness
**Subject:** D-4972 and D-2133

**Result:** SCP-6176 became a unified self-expression of its own perceived deific status among several GoI&#39;s. These formations expressed their own consciousness, which further reinforced SCP-6176 during later iterations.
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]
**Conscious State:** Unity Consciousness
**Subject:** D-4972 and D-2133

**Result:** SCP-6176 becomes the expression of all human perception. This was demonstrated when D-4972 broke visual contact and stared down at the concrete floor. This prompted SCP-6176 to form into concrete, as well as manifesting several symbolic images of concepts such as &#34;Underneath&#34; and &#34;Floor&#34;.
[[/div]]

Testing was concluded after it was deemed SCP-6176 had gained too much of an understanding of human consciousness to the point where it became capable of self-sustaining itself. SCP-6176 began to form a symbolic representation of consciousness which later evolved into an isolated conscious form within SCP-6176. This form then internally perceived SCP-6176 which then prompted the formation of a volatile prime instance.

**Addendum-2:** Once the SCP-6176-Prime instance was formed, it was deemed too essophysically dangerous to remain in wing G. Thus it was put to a vote for whether SCP-6176 should be transferred to the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4972 Adaptive Containment Chamber (ACC)] at Site-301.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]
##green|For## — 67%
##orange|Novote## — 13%
##red|Against## — 20%
[[/div]]

SCP-6176 was subsequently transported into the ACC.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]
**Transcriptor:** Kederesk.aic
----
**Begin…**

**12:00** SCP-6176 is placed within the chamber via the use of a transport automaton. The chamber is sealed and the adaptive lining is activated.

**12:34** The walls of the ACC begin to glow measuring around 650°C.

**12:45** Several adaptive plates begin to melt off the chamber walls. SCP-6176 grows more volatile.

**13:11** The chamber begins to stabilise with SCP-6176 reducing in size.

**13:25** SCP-6176 forms into both D-4972 and D-2133. Both D-class are found to now be absent from their quarters.

**13:56** SCP-6176 forms several thought forms. These forms then are reduced into their base concepts.

**14:05** SCP-6176 projects a noospheric pattern onto the chamber walls.

**14:17** Kederesk.aic is compromised as SCP-6176 forms into a deific automaton that begins breaking several of the adaptive plates.

**14:48** SCP-6176 then disappears. D-2133 is found back in their cell. D-4972&#39;s bed is found to be covered in dead butterflies.

**...End**
----
**Note:** The ACC was examined for structural damages. It was discovered that the ACC has already been used to contain [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4972 another anomaly], which was likely the reason SCP-6176&#39;s containment was compromised.
[[/div]]

**Addendum-3:** An interview was performed with D-2133 following SCP-6176&#39;s transference into the ACC.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]
**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Dr. Carè:** So you were temporarily transported into the ACC. Could you tell me a little bit about what you saw?

//D-2133 is silent for 10 seconds, looking down at the floor.//

**D-2133:** What&#39;s that?

**Dr. Carè:** The ACC? It&#39;s pretty simple…

**D-2133:** No, that (D-2133 points behind Dr. Care).

**Dr. Carè:** (Looking behind) I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re referring to?

**D-2133:** Oh, this is a pretty new experience for me.

//D-2133 looks down at their hands, the number of digits fluctuating from 1 to 400. Dr. Carè doesn&#39;t notice this.//

**D-2133:** Do you think if mankind ever heard God, they&#39;d react in fear or hope? Just a piece of God, like a heartbeat or something?

**Dr. Carè:** I… don&#39;t think I&#39;ve got an answer for that. Could you please try and answer the question.

**D-2133:** Well the chamber I was in adapts to contain it right?

//Dr. Carè wipes blood away from his nose.//

**Dr. Carè:** Yeah that&#39;s what it was designed for. Your point?

**D-2133:** If the embodiment of itself eventually became conscious, then the chamber introduced something that would break this. That would be showing the entity nothing.

**Dr. Carè:** So you&#39;re saying the ACC performed an unauthorised termination?

**D-2133:** Well, nothing ain&#39;t something a human&#39;s capable of perceiving. Most likely it repurposed the robot to do that. Even then it only caused its consciousness to burst. You can&#39;t introduce something as complex a consciousness to something as miniscule as nothing, that would simply break the laws of thermodynamics.

**Dr. Carè:** (Coughing) So where is SCP-6176 now?

//Dr. Carè vomits and collapses onto the table.//

**&lt;End Log&gt;**
