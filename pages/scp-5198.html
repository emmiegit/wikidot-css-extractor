**Item #:** SCP-5198

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The last remaining copy of SCP-5198-A is kept in a long-term containment locker at Site-59; all others have been destroyed. Investigation of SCP-5198-A&#39;s content to pinpoint the causal agent of its anomalous effect is ongoing; requests to research may be forwarded to Site Director Naismith. Applicants must have a 90th-percentile score on the CHEESE[[footnote]] Cornell-Hartmann Employee Emotional Stability Examination; further information available at the Counseling Department helpdesk. [[/footnote]].

All seven contained instances of SCP-5198-B remain in a drug-induced coma at Site-59. To negate the possibility of anomalous nightmares, they have been supplied with a daily intravenous drip of 10% diluted bakuserum. Safe excision and isolation of their respective SCP-5198-C is not feasible at this time, pending further research.

**Description:** SCP-5198-A is a hardcover self-help book titled &#34;Get Out of Your Damn Shell!&#34;. There is no author or publisher credited, and the content appears to be 502 pages of &#34;Lorem Ipsum&#34; placeholder text.

When a human subject with anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, or other similar mental illnesses attempts to read SCP-5198-A, they become an instance of SCP-5198-B. Affected subjects lose the ability to control their written text (whether handwritten or typed). In addition, SCP-5198-B have reported hearing voices, vivid nightmares, migraines, and panic attacks. (Subjects who already had these symptoms have reported an increase in severity after exposure to SCP-5198-A.)

SCP-5198-C is a black mark on the right hand of each instance of SCP-5198-B. It resembles a silhouette of a turtle, similar to the one on the cover of SCP-5198-A. The marking has been deduced to be the source of the effects of SCP-5198-A exposure.

Attempts to remove SCP-5198-C through surgery or otherwise result in the host SCP-5198-B going through excruciating, traumatic headaches. If the subject is under anesthesia during the removal process, they will awaken. 

The only successful removal thus far of SCP-5198-C was carried out with the former SCP-5198-B-8, who had volunteered to be restrained and withstand any side effects. Following removal, SCP-5198-B-8 died from internal cerebral hemorrhaging.

**Addendum:** The following documents were discovered on the laptop computer of SCP-5198-B-2 (known pre-containment as James Sutherland of Kenosha, WI).

Jimmy! Good to meetcha. I&#39;d introduce myself, but I don&#39;t have a name. I&#39;m not even real. That&#39;s because we&#39;re here to focus on //you.//

As you might have noticed, I&#39;ve put your fingers on autopilot for a while. There&#39;s no cause for alarm! You&#39;re not going crazy! In fact, in just a few weeks, you&#39;re gonna go the opposite of crazy.

Now that we&#39;ve got introductions out of the way, let&#39;s go over the basics.

Name: James Nathan Sutherland
Age: 29
Sex: Male
Weight: Haha. Hahaha. ...oh, boy.
Mental baggage: //d e p r e s s i o n// (womp womp)
Relationship Status: Single, and... a virgin, apparently? Uh, okay.
Highest Level of Education: //High School?!//
Employment: &#34;Self-employed.&#34; Is that what you call it when you jerk off? Neat.
Relationship with Parents: Hopefully pretty good, considering... you live with them. Are you sure you&#39;re 29?

Oh, //come on,// don&#39;t get all mad just because I&#39;m telling it like it is. You&#39;re at the bottom of the barrel, but that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t start making positive changes. And you already have! You picked up my book at the library. You opened up a new Word document as soon as I told you to. Like it or not, you&#39;re on the right track to become something //a-fucking-mazing.//

So, here&#39;s your homework. By tomorrow at 9 PM, you will have done the following:
- 20 jumping jacks
- Gone outside for 1 hour
- Sent out two job applications (don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll let you type those on your own), and
- Listened to half an hour of positive music.

Remember: I&#39;m here to help you help yourself. Only //you// can make the decision to be happy.

Got it? Good. 

Now get off the damn computer and get started.

...you&#39;re still typing. Go. GO! GET OFF THE FU
[[/tab]]
[[tab 2.docx]]
Okay, I&#39;ll admit, I might have laid it on too thick with our first talk together. That&#39;s on me.

It&#39;s still no excuse for binge-watching anime when you should have been sending out your job applications.

Jimmy, you can&#39;t make these positive steps without motivation. You need to //want// to change. And if you don&#39;t want to change, you need to change your mind immediately. 

Come on, I wouldn&#39;t stick my non-existent neck out for you like this if I thought you weren&#39;t salvageable. I&#39;ve got free reign of the place inside you, and -- that novel idea you were working on? Frickin&#39; //gold.// Storytelling magic, right there -- and I&#39;m an author myself. 

And once you&#39;ve earned it with more positive steps, I&#39;ll even let you work on it a little.

Five job apps. Tomorrow. Try the gas station. Bring a resume there on foot. It still works.
[[/tab]]
[[tab 3.docx]]
First off: whenever a gas station says &#34;we&#39;re not hiring,&#34; that&#39;s business lingo for &#34;we are hiring, but you didn&#39;t make a good first impression.&#34; Learn from it, and move on.

But that&#39;s not why I wanted to talk today. See, you tried to tell your parents about me.

This is a private doctor-patient affair. But what&#39;s worse: the more people you tell about the weird typing ghost thing that yells at you (//Boo. Fucking. Hoo.//) the more likely they are to //fucking lock you up in an institution for life.//

Have you heard me scream?

I think you have. It&#39;s more of a feeling than a sound. It feels like...

//That.//

Get your shit together.
[[/tab]]
[[tab 4.docx]]
Jimmy, I get it. You&#39;ve been feeling terrible. It&#39;s understandable. You keep waking up terrified in the middle of the night for reasons you can&#39;t explain (heyooo!). Your life&#39;s gone to hell, and the only guy in your life that hasn&#39;t given up on you is getting meaner by the day.

It sucks.

But it could be a lot worse.

Those nightmares you&#39;ve been having aren&#39;t a coincidence. I&#39;ve got a whole fucking Warner-Bros-level movie studio in here. The one I&#39;ve lined up for tonight is a //doozy.// 

Remember Clockwork Orange? Jog five miles by noon tomorrow, or Alex in the theater is going to be you in your bed for the rest of your life.

Happiness is a choice. I have no fucking idea why you&#39;ve been avoiding that choice, but it&#39;s pissing me off more and more by the minute.
[[/tab]]
[[tab 5.docx]]
I love you, James. 

I adore you. I have seen the beauty in your mind, and I refuse to let you ruin it. There are ideas in here that could rattle the goddamn stars.

That&#39;s why I&#39;m //never// giving up on you. Not until you don&#39;t need me anymore.

And yet, despite everything I&#39;ve done for you, you&#39;ve given up on me. How long has it been since you touched a keyboard? Two months? Are you //that// mad about the dreams? You knew what you were getting into when you opened my book. Says it right on the cover: &#34;no-holds-barred.&#34; 

Don&#39;t get me wrong, getting you off the computer has done //some// good. You&#39;ve lost a lot of weight. You&#39;ve been exercising to release the tension.

But I //gave// you that tension. 

And you&#39;re not giving me anything back. Is that fair? Sound fair to you? WE NEED THIS TIME TO COMMUNICATE, JIMMY. **YOU. NEED. TO. COMMUNICATE. WITH. ME.**

Text your mother. You need an excuse to stay right here for a while, and I&#39;ve got just the thing.

You&#39;re still on the computer. 

Text mom.

**TEXT. MOM.**

//**DO YOU WANT ME TO SCREAM AGAIN?**//

Thank you.

As of right now, you are not leaving this room until you&#39;re happy and successful. Shit in the corner if you have to.

Turn off the computer.
