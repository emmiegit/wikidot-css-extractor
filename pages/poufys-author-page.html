**Item-#** POUF

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-POUF cannot be reliably contained. It is possible to attract SCP-POUF by conversing in a variety of topics, including Music Theory, geopolitics, queer culture, pufferfish, and lastly, bagels. Following an encounter with SCP-POUF, personnel must immediately detain it before it becomes distracted and wanders off. 

Personnel are advised that SCP-POUF possesses strong cognitohazardous effects resulting from its inability to form coherent sentences.

**Description:** SCP-POUF is the designation for a cryptic, infrequently frequently seen entity present at key moments in several anomalous objects&#39; discovery or incidents. SCP-POUF&#39;s involvement in these objects is unknown, however it is known to materialize and dematerialize during these incidents. An incomplete list of documented anomalies it has manifested near is available below as well as notes left by SCP-POUF at the scene.

&gt; I basically made an account just to write this idea. I&#39;m super happy with how it came out, even if it wasn&#39;t a runaway success. Posting right before goblincon probably hindered it. Anyways, the fishies probably took the longest to write out of my articles so far, coming in at just under 8k words.
[[[SCP-7419]]]
&gt; I was extremely nervous to post this one, fearing it would get a poor reception and have to go through many postings. The fact that it exploded in popularity will forever confound me. Was super fun to write and make.
[[[SCP-7151]]]
&gt; Had this cute idea that I felt would work well in shortform. The horror of American suburban culture is always something that&#39;s fascinated me as an outsider. It came to me fairly quickly since thematically it was similar to a much larger I&#39;m working on.
[[[SCP-6541]]]
&gt; Very personal article. Initial idea came from imagining bear traps plopping about like clams and mauling people. Also my first article to cause legitimate discourse. Make of that what you will.
[[[SCP-6923]]]
&gt; Another very personal article. Writing it was a very emotionally taxing process that wore me down quite a bit. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m fully satisfied with its reception, but if I had kept it any longer I would&#39;ve quit writing. 
[[[SCP-7471]]]
&gt; A fun, gorey article inspired by both occult horror and true crime. Was fairly quick to write and is, imo, one of my best articles. Probably my best title.
[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7793|SPHERE]]]
&gt; Had a lot of fun writing this. Not much to say beyond what I already put in the author post.
[[[SCP-7575]]]
&gt; This was a short idea that I sketched out while working on a larger article. Ended up developing it into something really cool with the help of some of my regular creative idea bouncers. As a fun fact, the idea of a vibrating noise object was something I thought about in early stages of SPHERE, too.
[[[SCP-7951]]]
&gt; Collab with Industry Standard. We wrote this as a sort of Rorschach Test. One of my best articles imo.
[[[SCP-7783]]]
&gt; An exercise in restrained and understated melancholy. A very important piece for me as it helped me through the last emotions of a breakup. Fun fact, the second image is originally of a wall near downtown. Every time I walk past it, I swear I can see the facial outline I edited in. But it&#39;s not there, obviously.</textarea></pre>
