**Item #:** SCP-3052

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3052-1 is to be kept in a Standard Humanoid Containment Chamber. SCP-3052-1&#39;s containment is to be constantly monitored via video surveillance by Level 2 staff or higher. SCP-3052-1 is allowed one session with the on-site psychologist per week. These sessions are to be observed via surveillance by Level 2 staff or higher. Any requests made by SCP-3052-1 must be directed to and approved by a Level 4 staff member or higher. Experiments involving showing SCP-3052-1 recordings of SCP-3052-2 instances are currently pending approval.

**Description:** SCP-3052 is the collective designation for two entities, SCP-3052-1 and SCP-3052-2. SCP-3052-1 is a humanoid entity with an appearance similar to that of a crudely drawn, copper-colored stick figure, standing approximately 1.85 meters in height. Two circular holes in SCP-3052-1&#39;s head, approximately 9 centimeters in diameter, appear to function as eyes. SCP-3052-1 is believed to be two-dimensional. However, it was discovered that any subject viewing SCP-3052-1 will perceive it as facing them directly, no matter which angle or direction the subject views it from. Therefore, its true dimensions cannot be determined. X-Rays have shown that SCP-3052-1 lacks a skeletal structure, as well as organs. Analysis of samples taken from SCP-3052-1 shows that it is composed of a mixture of spray paint, acrylic paint, and human blood. Despite a lack of visible hands, SCP-3052-1 is capable of holding and manipulating most objects. SCP-3052-1 lacks a visible mouth and has not expressed a need for food or water. As of writing, SCP-3052-1 has only expressed a need for sleep (see Interview Log 3052-I1).

SCP-3052-1 is incapable of vocalizing. However, it can communicate via words that it visually manifests near its head for a period ranging from seven to ten seconds before dematerializing. These words are seemingly composed of the same substances that make up SCP-3052-1 and retain the property of facing viewers directly. SCP-3052-1 has demonstrated a wide vocabulary, yet it prefers manifesting only a few words at a time. SCP-3052-1 claims to suffer from various mental illnesses, including depression, anxiety, and mild schizophrenia. This was confirmed after an interview with the on-site psychologist. SCP-3052-1 is currently attending weekly therapy sessions.

SCP-3052-1&#39;s anomalous effects manifest when it is photographed or video recorded. Photographs and recordings taken of SCP-3052-1 show additional subjects not present at the time of recording designated SCP-3052-2. Instances of SCP-3052-2 are black entities with crimson eyes, similar in composition to that of SCP-3052-1. While these entities are often shapeless, they have been observed to take the shape of various animals, including crows, domestic cats, and an as-of-yet unidentified species of a large reptile. Video recordings have shown that SCP-3052-2 instances communicate in a similar manner to SCP-3052-1, with the exception that the words that materialize are black in color. SCP-3052-2 instances have been observed communicating with SCP-3052-1, usually harassing it with insults and verbal threats. SCP-3052-2 instances have been observed claiming that the Foundation has plans to terminate SCP-3052-1[[footnote]] No plans to terminate SCP-3052-1 have yet been made. [[/footnote]]. SCP-3052-1 will simply nod in response to these claims, and in rare cases, will verbally respond, affirming SCP-3052-2&#39;s claims (see Video Log 3052-V2).

SCP-3052-1 was discovered on June 19th, ████, living in the home of a digital animator ████ ██████. ██████ was found dead in his bedroom. Autopsy reports show that subject died of an overdose of the drug ██████████████, a common antipsychotic. Blood samples from ██████ did not match up with the blood found in SCP-3052-1&#39;s composition. Search for a DNA match is currently ongoing.

**Addendum 3052-A1:** Due to compliance with the Foundation, SCP-3052-1 has been allowed several requests for various items and amenities. Below is a list of requests that have been made thus far.

**Interview Log 3052-I1:**

&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-3052-1
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. ██████, current on-site psychologist
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** The following is an excerpt of a session between Dr. ██████ and SCP-3052-1.
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** How are you today?
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3052-1:** Kind of tired.
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** Have you been having trouble sleeping?
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3052-1:** I keep having the dreams.
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** Yes, you&#39;ve told me about them. Have you written them down as I advised?
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3052-1:** I keep forgetting. Sorry.
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** There&#39;s no need to apologize, it&#39;s completely optional. Still, it might help. Do you still hear the voices?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3052-1:** All the time.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** Do they sound like anyone you know?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3052-1:** I don&#39;t know a lot of people.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** What sort of things do they say?
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-3052-1 does not respond.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** If you don&#39;t feel comfortable discussing it, that&#39;s-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3052-1:** They say you&#39;re going to kill me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** Who is going to kill you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3052-1:** I&#39;m not sure. Whoever works here, I guess.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** Do you believe we&#39;re going to kill you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3052-1:** I don&#39;t know. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** Do you feel like you&#39;re in danger staying here?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3052-1:** Sometimes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** I see. Have you been experiencing any visual hallucinations?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3052-1:** Like, seeing things?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** Precisely.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3052-1:** Not really, no.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** Nothing unusual or strange?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3052-1:** I don&#39;t think so.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** I see. 
&gt; 
&gt; //Dr. ██████ makes a note on his clipboard.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** Is there anything else you&#39;d like to discuss?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3052-1:** My watering can&#39;s almost empty.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** I&#39;ll let someone know.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** It&#39;s inferred that SCP-3052-1 is incapable of seeing instances of SCP-3052-2. At the conclusion of the session, SCP-3052-1&#39;s watering can was refilled. SCP-3052-1 was then observed watering its provided plant.

**Video Log 3052-V2:** The following is a transcript of a video recording of SCP-3052-1 on ██/██/████. This recording holds significance, as the recorded instance of SCP-3052-2 supposedly mentions ████ ██████, despite not previously displaying any knowledge of his existence.

&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-3052-1 is sitting at its provided desk in its containment chamber, its arms resting on the surface, looking at the west wall of its containment cell. After a period of about 45 seconds, an instance of SCP-3052-2 in the shape of a large reptilian slowly moves into frame from the left, stopping approximately 15 centimeters away from SCP-3052-1. SCP-3052-1 does not react to SCP-3052-2&#39;s appearance.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3052-2:** They&#39;re going to kill you, you know.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3052-1:** I know.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3052-2:** What are you going to do about it?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3052-1:** I don&#39;t know.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3052-2:** You might as well just let them. You&#39;d be doing the world an enormous favor. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3052-1:** Yeah, probably.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3052-2:** It&#39;s your fault that you&#39;re in here. If you had just kept your mouth shut and not asked him any damn questions, this wouldn&#39;t be happening. &#39;Where am I? What are these voices? Are you God?&#39; There is no God, idiot. He&#39;s dead, remember? He&#39;s dead and you killed him. Just like that. All because you opened your stupid mouth. Now you&#39;re going to Hell, and it&#39;s all your fault. 
&gt; 
&gt; //Both entities do not speak for a period of 15-20 seconds.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3052-2:** I&#39;m going away now. I can&#39;t stand looking at you.
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-3052-2 slowly moves away from SCP-3052-1 and out of frame. SCP-3052-1 continues looking at the west wall for the remainder of the video.//
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
