**Item #:** SCP-2016

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2016-1 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-20. Testing with SCP-2016-1 must be approved by at least one Level 2 Researcher. SCP-2016-1 must be inspected monthly for repairs.

**Description:** SCP-2016-1 is a knitted doll resembling a human male with a long white beard and dark green robes measuring approximately 32 cm in height. When humans enter REM sleep within 3 m of SCP-2016-1, they will experience vivid dreams. In addition to this, subjects will also usually encounter SCP-2016-2. 

SCP-2016-2 appears as an elderly human male with the same appearance as SCP-2016-1. It is always capable of understanding the language spoken by the dreamer, though it is not capable of verbal communication. These dreams always end with SCP-2016-2 handing the subject a piece of chalk and creating a wall while motioning for the subject to draw a rectangle with a circle inside on the surface of the wall.

If a subject attempts to draw the shape indicated in the dream on the surface of a wall within 7 days of having the dream, the drawing will transform into a door with a round handle. If the subject opens the door, it leads to an open meadow with a stone tower located a varying distance away. There will be a paper attached to the tower&#39;s door saying &#34;to my new apprentice&#34; in the subject&#39;s native language. Said tower&#39;s floors contain several libraries and laboratories. All subjects who have used these facilities have died in their sleep within 5 years. Cause of death is unknown, but all subjects have been reported to release a gaseous mass from their mouths which disappears seconds later. Video surveillance shows an elderly, translucent human male similar to SCP-2016-1 and SCP-2016-2 approaching the sleeping subjects and absorbing the gaseous mass into his hand.

Authorized personnel may refer to [[[Exploration Log 2016]]] for further details about the tower. Level 2 access is required to view the unabridged log.
