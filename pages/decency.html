&gt; Let all of those who read this know that I have not failed my duties to the SCP Foundation. I have not broken under stress, nor have I gone crazy. What has happened is that I cannot allow the events around me to continue any longer.
&gt; 
&gt; I am going to die. After hours in solitary confinement, and the time in-between being almost unbearable, I&#39;ve come to conclude that my actions after this writing will unquestionably lead to my demise. If you find this before I die, //do not// try to stop me. I&#39;ve made my peace with God, and decided that what I am going to do is the right thing.
&gt; 
&gt; What I am about to do is break every single Special Personnel Requirement for the project I am assigned to. Normally, I wouldn&#39;t do this, but I just can&#39;t let her suffer any longer. Even though I will die trying, she will know that somebody cares for her.
&gt; 
&gt; It will only be for a moment, maybe less. I don&#39;t care. Just as long as she&#39;s out of her torment for one second, it will be enough for me. It will be enough knowing that for that brief instant, she will know that she is not a prisoner, that she is not a monster, that somebody cares enough about her to do something about it. For that brief instant, she&#39;ll be free.
&gt; 
&gt; I have passed all the psychological examinations. I have not broken down. I don&#39;t love her. I don&#39;t want an XK. All I want is for her to know, for the briefest instant, that somebody cares for her as a human being.
&gt; 
&gt; And I will make sure she knows.
&gt; 
&gt; -Agent Shields

//Note: At 0900 hours, Agent Shields stripped off his concealing helmet and somehow entered the enclosure of [[[SCP-231|231-7]]]. 231-7 was awake at the time, but showed no reaction to Shields&#39; presence. Armed guards were deployed as he approached the bedside, placed a single rose upon it, and left the containment chamber. Four minutes after the security breach, Agent Shields was shot to death by six guards, and 231-7&#39;s amnestic schedule was altered slightly to allow for a dose shortly afterward. Procedure 110-Montauk was put into effect minutes later.//</textarea></pre>
