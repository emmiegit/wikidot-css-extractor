&gt; [05:55] DrTsega: As a reward for being such a cool and alive person, I&#39;m going to tell you the story of how we ended the world. 
&gt; [05:55] DrTsega: For context, though, you&#39;ll probably want to start by reading a certain document...
&gt; [05:56] DrTsega: Actually, you can probably just skim it. A lot of this won&#39;t make sense to you anyway, so who cares?
&gt; [05:57] DrTsega: Anyway. I&#39;ll go find the link. If memory serves, they declassified everything when they realized we were all gonna die.
&gt; [06:13] DrTsega: How are these servers even still up? Isn&#39;t that just the craziest thing
&gt; [08:22] DrTsega: Found it.

++++ NOTICE FROM THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE COORDINATION

There is nothing new to report regarding SPC-001 at this time.

**Project #:** SPC-001

**Selachian Pugnātorial Capabilities:** Individuals enhanced with SPC-001 display a dramatic improvement in pugilistic prowess and have consistently proven capable of easily dispatching 90% of squaloid entities in simulations, even with no prior training. Furthermore, SPC-001 subjects have reported a radical elevation in coastal requiescence position retention, even when under assault from extragranular sedimentary weaponry. 

**Project Components:** SPC-001 is a manmade chemical substance which augments the biological strength and dexterity of human beings. After initial exposure to SPC-001, subjects will undergo a steady increase in muscle mass over the following 72 hours, accompanied by heightened energy levels and adroit perception of their surroundings. Increased lung capacity and resistance to deep-sea hydrostatic pressure are common side effects. 

Following the **DREAD PORPOISE COMMUNION** and the subsequent activation of the **ALL HANDS ON DECK PROTOCOL**, SPC agents embedded in the food industry began introducing discreet amounts of SPC-001 into numerous products intended for public consumption. Centre researchers have projected a full global saturation of SPC-001 to be achieved by the year ████. In the event that the **DREAD PORPOISE COMMUNION** ends before global saturation can be achieved, more aggressive means of SPC-001 dispersal may be undertaken to prevent a complete End-of-World [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/k-o-failure-scenario-hub|K/O Failure Scenario]]]. 

**Nascency Impetus:** On May 16, ████, all observed selachian entities across the globe simultaneously demanifested, including those in SPC captivity. No selachian entities or evidence of the continued presence of selachian entities have been observed since. A Maximum State of Emergency was declared soon after by the Executive Pugilist Assembly and the phenomenon was codified as the **DREAD PORPOISE COMMUNION**. It is the belief of the Assembly that the selachians are congregating in preparation for the **FINAL CONFLICT**, an event foretold by Elder Pugilord Azmanititas in the Centre&#39;s original constitutional documents in 1451. 

&gt; [08:23] DrTsega: Did you get all that? 

&gt; [08:23] DrTsega: No? Okay, I&#39;ll break it down for you. 

&gt; [08:26] DrTsega: I was part of a group known as the Selachian Punching Centre. An organization dedicated to fighting the menace that plagued our oceans. &#34;We punch underwater so you can live on the land.&#34; That&#39;s what we used to say.

&gt; [08:27] DrTsega: I know what you&#39;re thinking.

&gt; [08:29] DrTsega: Yes. It was //us// keeping you safe the entire time. The Centre safeguarded mankind for centuries. Civilization as we knew it wouldn&#39;t have been possible if we weren&#39;t around. Our influence was unparalleled, extending to every level of every government, changing the course of world events, yet remaining a complete secret from everybody, which was really quite tricky. 

&gt; Then, one day, the selachian menace disappeared. Our immediate reaction was one of disbelief, followed by euphoria, followed by raucous celebration. We danced. We drank ourselves stupid. We sang the songs of our forefathers. The orgies weren&#39;t officially sanctioned, of course, but boy howdy-doo were they //tremendous//. 
&gt; 
&gt; Sadly, our revelry wasn&#39;t meant to last. 
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;DREAD PORPOISE COMMUNION&#34;, the Assembly called it. The prophesied gathering of every selachian, big or small. Every sharp, slimy, //putrid horror// that haunted our dreams, coming together in one place to bring about the end of all other life on our beautiful, green planet. 
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;But fear not,&#34; said our trusted Assembly. They told us that the human race would fight back. They said that when the selachians returned with their armies and squaloid murder-drones, we would be ready. 
&gt; 
&gt; And they were right. We //were// ready. Thanks to SPC-001, we managed to get the entire human race fighting fit. At first people were alarmed when everyone started getting super ripped for no apparent reason, but then they realized it was awesome and the panic died down. Within a few months, every man, woman, and child was a lean, mean, punching machine. Even babies had abs you could wash your clothes on. It seemed like everything was going fine.
&gt; 
&gt; And that&#39;s how it went for the first couple of years: fine. Sure, boxing had to be outlawed once folks could punch with the same Newtonian force as your average car crash, and there were a few riots now and then over tank top shortages, but for the most part everything felt normal. 
&gt; 
&gt; Year three, people started getting antsy. We had kept ourselves busy at the Centre by devising new weapons for selachian warfare, but every innovation felt hollow with a lack of anything to use them on. We grew listless. Surely the assault would begin any day, right?
&gt; 
&gt; Year four. There was an aura of dread hanging over the whole organization. I remember sitting in the Site-71 cafeteria, eating pickled cabbage and creamed corn salads with my comrades, when I finally heard someone ask aloud what we&#39;d all wondered in the dark corners of our heads.
&gt; 
&gt; //&#34;What if they don&#39;t come back?&#34;//
&gt; 
&gt; It was Simmons who said that, of course. //Of course//. I kicked him in the face—a punch would have really hurt him—but the damage was done. It&#39;s a scary thought, losing your purpose in life. Faced with that kind of existential ennui, it&#39;s no wonder that everyone responded by flipping their shit. Hersberger screamed and started smearing her salad all over her face. Gertzler stabbed his fork tines into his cheek with no visible emotion. Bühler just broke down and cried until his tears turned to blood. 
&gt; 
&gt; But Schwartzentruber was downright fuming. Started shouting all sorts of obscenities. Said he&#39;d shove his fist down Simmons&#39; throat and rip out his toenails from the inside. And Simmons was all defensive, &#34;you all were thinking it&#34; and that kind of stuff. The two kept going at it. We shouldn&#39;t have just sat there and watched, but no one thought fists would ever get involved. How could we have known? 
&gt; 
&gt; I remember the entire cafeteria going silent. One moment, the two colleagues had been arguing. Next thing we knew, Schwartzentruber was wearing Simmons&#39; face around his arm like a bracelet. Fist went straight through. Nobody knew what to say. Hersberger just picked the brain matter from her hair. There was no finishing our dinner after something like that. 
&gt; 
&gt; We all tried to write it off as an isolated incident, an unhinged employee who forgot his own strength in a moment of pure emotion. That illusion was shattered when reports started coming in from the other sites. Similar incidents were happening all over the world, and within a few weeks it wasn&#39;t just limited to SPC personnel. These arms were made for punching, and that&#39;s just what they did.
&gt; 
&gt; As time went on, it became harder for us to fight the itch. Punching bags were laughable at that point, so instead we invented punching blocks out of a titanium-concrete composite. Even fashioned them into the shape of selachians to help take the pain away, but it still wasn’t enough. Whenever we came close to a cure, someone would end up atomizing the equipment with a flick of the wrist and we&#39;d have to start over. 
&gt; 
&gt; Eventually, one day I walked into the cafeteria and found the floor covered in what must have been two inches of blood. I thought maybe a pipe had burst until I saw Bühler sitting on a table in the corner. Guy was slathered in viscera from top to bottom, and he was wearing human heads around his arms like they were snap bracelets. I asked if he wanted to talk, but he didn&#39;t answer. He just stared at his fists and trembled. Then, in the blink of an eye, he was dead, hole in his beefy chest so big I coulda driven my Grampy&#39;s Volvo through it. 
&gt; 
&gt; That was what broke me, I think. I had never seen someone self-pugilate before. I didn&#39;t know how many people were still alive in Site-71, but I knew that I would not perpetuate the carnage. I gathered some medical supplies from the surgical augmentations lab and tied a tourniquet around my burgeoning, well-defined bicep. Carefully, I injected myself with the nearest substance that resembled an anesthetic and bid my guns goodbye. 
&gt; 
&gt; Screaming, writhing, I hacked off my arm using only a pair of rusty toenail clippers. Needless to say, I was dizzy from pain, blood loss, and the 5 CCs of green apple daiquiri I&#39;d injected myself with, but somehow I managed to drag myself back to the cafeteria to cauterize my stump in the kitchen&#39;s oven. Barely clinging to consciousness, I set the oven to preheat, wrapped my stump in a tent of foil, and stuck it inside, turning regularly to promote an even cauter and applying a light baste to keep it moist.
&gt; 
&gt; When the bleeding stopped, I went back and repeated the process with my other arm. The second time was harder, I think. With no free hands remaining, I was forced to grip the toenail clippers with my teeth. I also ran out of baste. It was the most agonizing experience I could ever possibly fathom, but here I am. Alive. My cannonball deltoids still ripple with pugilistic vigor now and then, but the stubs are too short to be lethal. 
&gt; 
&gt; And that&#39;s it. That&#39;s my story. That&#39;s how I ended up here, barricaded alone in an underground facility, typing on a keyboard with my tongue. I haven&#39;t been able to get in touch with any other Centre sites, and I can&#39;t leave the building. Every day I lose a little more hope. My personal hygiene has suffered, too—partly because I can&#39;t look at a pair of clippers without bursting into tears. My toenails are getting //really// long now. I&#39;ll probably have to use a pair of scissors or something. I could even use that electric carving knife I got for my birthday. Hell, I think there&#39;s a chainsaw in the supply closet. No shortage of options, really.
&gt; 
&gt; Even if I&#39;m alive now, there&#39;s no telling how long that will last. Sometimes I hear people punching on the reinforced doors, desperate to break in and claim another victim to slake their drunken punchlust. Someday they may succeed. There&#39;s enough food left around to keep me going a while, though //just// for a while. I&#39;ve kept my mind occupied and my spirits up by watching Dr. Cavender&#39;s Walking Dead box sets, but I can feel that post-Season-Six quality drop looming just around the corner. 
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe this was their plan all along. Maybe they just left the planet, knowing full well we&#39;d destroy ourselves. Maybe when the last human has passed their final breath, the selachians will return from wherever they went and feast on our tight, sculpted corpses. Or maybe they&#39;re happier where they are now. Maybe they&#39;re not coming back. I hope that&#39;s not the case. As much as it pains me to say it: I miss them. 
&gt; 
&gt; I miss sharks. 

&gt; [23:19] DrTsega: With all the squats I&#39;ve been doing, I could probably pop their heads between my fucking thighs. 

&gt; [23:20] DrTsega: pop &#39;em just like cherries. hell yeah</textarea></pre>
