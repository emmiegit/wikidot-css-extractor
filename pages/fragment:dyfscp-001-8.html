    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Item:** SCP-001-A

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-001-A is to be kept under constant surveillance at Soundproofed Warehouse 10 of the Large Anomaly Containment Wing at Site-59. Personnel conducting routine maintenance checks must use level --3B-- --5A-- --7A-- 26M ear protection at all times.

**Description:** SCP-001-A is a  13.59 m x 2.44 m x 2.9 shipping container. Its exterior has been reinforced with an unknown substance that, to date, has completely withstood all attempts to cut through.

Save for the presence of SCP-001-A-1, it is identical in appearance and, presumably, function to SCP-001. However, the fact that the bulkhead has been permanently closed from within makes usage as a backup for SCP-001 non-viable.

SCP-001-A-1 is a flat metallic device, 2.1 m in height and 0.9 m in width. The text &#34;SCP-FNA&#34;[[footnote]] Does not reference any known SCP designation. [[/footnote]] has been painted on the surface. Through unknown means, it has been permanently affixed to the right wall of SCP-001-A&#39;s &#34;cockpit.&#34; Whether or not SCP-001-A-1 has &#34;phased into&#34; the wall is unknown.

SCP-001-A-2 denotes 57 (so far) identical humanoid entities of indeterminate gender, intelligence, and identity. Tissue samples taken from SCP-001-A-2 display both human and bovine DNA.

SCP-001-A-3 denotes a pocket-dimensional space accessible through SCP-001-A-1. Following Incident-001-A-0, it is inaccessible.

**Addendum 1 -- Incident-001-A-0:** On 9/1/22 at 1050 GMT, the bulkhead to SCP-001-A suddenly closed from within. Concurrently, all contained instances of SCP-001-A-2 died instantaneously through unknown means.

Five minutes later, SCP-001-A began emitting a constant piercing noise from within. Though SCP-001-A&#39;s exterior has muffled the sound considerably, the noise has maintained a consistent volume of ███ dB.

The sound vaguely resembles an old man screaming.

**Addendum 2 -- Inactivity:** On 10/13/25, the noise stopped for 17 minutes and five seconds...
