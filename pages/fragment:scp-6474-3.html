*Special Containment procedures* be quiet i guess

*description* jkl;adsfjkl;dfasjkl;afsdjkl;dfsajklfdas

*test*
//test//
**test?**

I don&#39;t know how to do this. I haven&#39;t written official documentation before. 

Everyone I&#39;ve ever known has always been illiterate or brain dead. I just read the old version of this document and apparently it wasn&#39;t always like that. If there&#39;s a way I&#39;m supposed to react I never learned it. 

I forget who it was. I think it was the French. When they retired Morse code, the final message they broadcasted was &#34;Calling all. This is our last cry before our eternal silence.&#34; I remember that. I remember learning that.

Here I am, I&#39;m the last cry. That&#39;s a loss for humanity I can tell you that much. I&#39;m not a poet. I&#39;m not a historian. If I wanted to be romantic I would call myself archivist. I just write down what&#39;s happened. And nothing&#39;s happening anymore. 

Like everyone else, I haven&#39;t said anything as long as I&#39;ve been alive. But I can still read and write and think. My thoughts haven&#39;t gone silent like they have for everyone else. So maybe I actually was born this way. 

The worst part was waiting to see if you&#39;d be the one with something horrible. One day you&#39;re fine and then the next you&#39;ve never been yourself. You might even figure out that you could speak once, that you could be heard, but now that&#39;s gone and it&#39;s too late. And everything you ever said, the kind words, whatever&#39;s worth remembering, it&#39;s gone now. Gone for good. And soon your mind will hear your last thought and then that&#39;s gone silent too and you won&#39;t even notice. 

It&#39;s so quiet.

I don&#39;t

I want

I want to know what happened. I want to say what happened, but I don&#39;t know. I saw a printed version of that part in the exploration log. They upped the resolution, it&#39;s huge. It covers this whole wall. It looks a lot clearer than when I first saw it, way back when I was transcribing those logs. I don&#39;t see anything that answers anything. 

It does look beautiful, though. I tried to upload it but the code was corrupted immediately. I guess it doesn&#39;t matter. 
But it&#39;s a waterfall, I think. A waterfall of sound. It&#39;s a bright white, and I can see
I can see the sound of everything. I just look at this image, and I can hear the tides of the ocean I can hear cars and wind and birds and footsteps and a gunshot and 
I can hear someone laughing. I can hear someone talking. I hear the noises swirl and blend and flow together the longer I look at it and all of it is wonderful. 

I think that after I hit save the code will be corrupted again too. Nothing&#39;s going to work soon, no one&#39;s going to speak or say anything ever again.
It&#39;s so quiet. I close my eyes and I don&#39;t hear a thing.

I&#39;ll try and fix it. I&#39;ll go to the cave and do
something, i guess
I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ll bring the four horsemen of silence along with me if it would help. I can get people to help, it&#39;s not hard. 

I&#39;m going to try. I&#39;m going try and whatever else I&#39;ll know that I did that much.

I click save and these words are no longer mine. They go out in the world, ready to be erased. 



Calling all. Here&#39;s hoping you haven&#39;t heard the last of me.
