Doctor Pen, SCP-7799-3

[BEGIN LOG]
 
**Pen:** ...I still don&#39;t understand what you mean. 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** I told you already. My name is Administrator X, and I command the X-Insurgency to bring an end to Kaiser Valentine Constantine&#39;s rule over my rightful invention. 
 
**Pen:** You told me that already. 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Want me to explain the story again, doctor? 
 
**Pen:** No, no. That won&#39;t be necessary. Just tell me why you call yourself an administrator. 
  
**SCP-7799-3:** I elaborated on that already. 
 
**Pen:** No, what I mean is- you know what? Nevermind. We can talk about that another time. Instead, tell me who this &#34;Kaiser&#34; is that you and your &#34;X-Insurgency&#34; are trying to stop. Who is he? What does he do? Is this Kaiser anomalous like you? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** It depends on your scientific definition of the anomalous, doctor.
 
**Pen:** Anomolous as in... like you. Any defining traits or appearance we could go off of to find out more about this &#34;Kaiser&#34; you keep telling me about? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** If I had to be specific, I would personally describe the man as... insane, a trickster, an idiot... 
 
**Pen:** That doesn&#39;t tell me anything about this &#34;man&#34; you speak of. 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** I don&#39;t know how else to describe him to you. 
 
**Pen:** What does he look like physically? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** If I had to describe him, you could say he&#39;s the type of man to eavesdrop on someone without them knowing. Or the type of man who could convince a good and honest man, the exact opposite of himself, to kill his family for some candy and a pat on the head. I mean that as a hyperbole, obviously. But who knows, maybe he could at this rate- 
 
**Pen:** That doesn&#39;t tell me anything either. 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** I don&#39;t know any other way to describe him. I told you everything there is to know about him. 
 
[Pen stares at SCP-7799-3 with accusatory intolerance.] 
 
**Pen:** Don&#39;t think I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing. You&#39;re wasting our time, aren&#39;t you? 
  
**SCP-7799-3:** I don&#39;t know what you mean, doctor. I&#39;ve told you nothing but the truth this whole time. 
 
**Pen:** You&#39;re doing this on purpose. You won&#39;t tell us what&#39;s going on, will you? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** I told you what I am and what I do. 
 
**Pen:** But you haven&#39;t told us anything about those things.
 
[SCP-7799-3 looks off somewhere else, tuning out Pen.]
 
**Pen:** You know, &#34;Administrator X&#34;, we have many humanoid anomalies just like you, and I&#39;ve talked to many of them, too. Around here, we don&#39;t use any kind of harmful strategies to get information out of them, even if they don&#39;t talk to us. But you? We know you have something to do with this. You&#39;ve been doing nothing but wasting our time with fancy descriptions of random names and places that we think you&#39;re making up.  
 
[SCP-7799-3 is silent.] 
 
**Pen:** We in the SCP-7799 Research and Containment Project will get answers at any cost, even if it will come to... unorthodox methods of doing so. You will give us answers, X. 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** [Chuckle] I just did. 
 
**Pen:** I&#39;m ending this conversation of ours. You will be taken back to your cell and transported to Site-88 first thing in the morning.
 
**SCP-7799-3:** You English scientists don&#39;t understand anything. The Kaiser will play you like a fiddle, he knows what you&#39;re doing. 
 
**Pen:** Excuse me? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** He knows you&#39;re surrounding his little eighties pretend kingdom like the Ottomans did to the Byzantines. He knows you want the machine. 
 
**Pen:** We&#39;re the Foundation, we&#39;ll take care of this little &#34;Kaiser&#34; you speak of. 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** He may appear little from that pedestal you white-coated scientist stand on, but I can reassure you that you&#39;ll wish you had never captured me. As we speak, my men are probably dropping like flies now that I&#39;m gone. 
 
**Pen:** We&#39;ll see about that.

**Item #:** 7799
 
**Object Class:** Euclid [[span style=&#34;color:yellow&#34;]]●[[/span]]
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7799 is partially contained, as its interior territory is teeming with millions of individual anomalous entities under the influence of a militarized absolute monarchy[[footnote]] Effectively a dictatorship. [[/footnote]] and a disorganized insurgency with conflicting goals. In response to the vastness of this anomaly and its intricate nature, the only action required is the consistent encirclement and surveillance of SCP-7799&#39;s outside perimeter via the SCP-7799 Research and Containment Headquarters. If an SCP-7799-2 or SCP-7799-4 instance exits the anomaly itself, they are to be immediately neutralized. However, if an artificial civilian exits the anomaly, it is to be promptly rescued and rehabilitated into non-anomalous human society in a country of their choosing.[[footnote]] This outcome is usually rare, as most civilian entities under SCP-7799&#39;s tyrannical government show utmost loyalty to it and its ideals.[[/footnote]]
  
Concerning SCP-7799-3, it is to be contained in an average humanoid containment cell in --Site-88 located in Baldwin County, Alabama-- Site-228 located in Hungary. It is in best interest to keep SCP-7799-3 as far from SCP-7799 as possible. 
 
The retrieval of the other half of SCP-7799-A is preferable, however due to the nature of SCP-7799, it is in best interest to wait for a feasible opportunity to do so. The half of SCP-7799-A currently in Foundation containment is to be contained in a storage room in Site-19. 
  
**Description:** SCP-7799 is an anomalous landlocked territory located southwest of Langtry, Texas, USA sitting above the Rio Grande River that from the outside perimeter, initially appears to be a 1500-meter-long concrete wall that is approximately 10 meters tall and circles back on itself to surround an empty plot of desert ground. Upon entering this confine, a paradoxical effect occurs in which its interior becomes significantly more immense than what is presented outside, materializing thousands of towns, large cities, entities, and extended desert spaces depending on the area the subject enters from. Entering SCP-7799 from an aerial perspective also activates this phenomenon.
 
Once within the area, any structures or entities that happen to be stationed in that location will reportedly materialize into view. Exiting the area causes these structures and entities to become evanescent. All technological devices that in any way run on twenty-first technology or the internet will deactivate the second they enter SCP-7799&#39;s influence. Additionally, most if not all sounds occurring within SCP-7799 will not be heard outside of the territory, and vice-versa. These phenomena were likely implemented to prevent outside suspicion and isolate the territory. 
 
The area itself consists of multiple regions comparable to parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire during the early twentieth century; however, exhibits 1980s American architecture and culture, including a predominantly desert geography and characteristics found in the Vaporwave subgenre of music.[[footnote]] With a notable exception to modern Japanese culture and anime-style motifs, which appear to not be present in SCP-7799. [[/footnote]] An example of this would be a region in SCP-7799 that mimics the capital city of the modern-day Czech Republic, Prague, which has been visually changed to adhere to this time frame. The total size of the territory has been estimated to be around 620,500 km2 in size[[footnote]] This measurement appears to be similar in size to the historical Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1914.[[/footnote]]. 
 
Aside from cities, towns, and barren spaces within SCP-7799, there are estimated to be 60 million humanoid entities, most of which appear to be artificially-created human civilians of Central, Eastern, South, and Southeastern European descent, and speak the respective languages predominantly spoken in those areas. These civilians, which do not warrant a unique SCP number classification and make up most of SCP-7799&#39;s population, engage in activities and societal roles similar to 1980s America while strictly devoting themselves to routine and government-enforced conservative Roman Catholicism. Civilians who reject or fail to meet these religious standards are immediately shunned, or imprisoned by SCP-7799-2 instances and in some cases, are subject to physical harassment. Additionally, civilians rigorously engage in government-sponsored activities that emulate the popular activities and cultures of 1980s America, such as 80s music and other shallow endeavors. Various billboards and television advertisements are observed to rigorously promote these activities to civilians, presumably assisting in this unorthodox behavior.
  
SCP-7799-A is a machine that is approximately 8 meters tall and weighs 49 grams. It is a bright red sphere from its exterior and hollow in the interior to contain multiple copper pipes and aluminum cogs. These pipes and cogs appear to have no function or relevance to the machine, which is currently cut in half. One half is deactivated and successfully contained, whilst the other half is in use by SCP-7799-1. It is most likely responsible for the creation of SCP-7799 itself and the entities within it but is poorly understood. Its exact procedures in creating these phenomena are unknown, outside of allegedly creating objects and entities in a lower-quality state, according to SCP-7799-3 in an interrogation. Its procedures for expanding the area or keeping it sealed off in the way it is are also unknown, however SCP-7799 has not expanded its outside border or interior since its discovery. 
  
Below are two description documents showcasing SCP-7799-1 and SCP-7799-2, their reasonings for the existence of SCP-7799, and their impact on the anomaly as a whole. 
 
[[div style=&#34;color: black; border: solid 2px #000000; background:#f2f2c2 url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat; padding:15px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align:center;&#34;]]

++ **ENTITY PROFILE #7799/3** 
  
**Entity Description:** SCP-7799-3 is a humanoid entity resembling an adult male of Hungarian descent, with a large, yellow, motionless smiley face as a substitute for its head that is inseparable from its neck. Despite this, it is capable of speaking Hungarian, Austrian German, and English with the proper fluency needed in those languages. 
 
**Discovery:** SCP-7799-3 was recovered on November 23rd, 2022 after Foundation field agents apprehended it upon discovering it outside of SCP-7799, attempting to climb up its wall near the southwesternmost section, assumably to get back over the other side. After suffering a long fall, it was brought to Site-73, where it was interrogated. When further limited research on SCP-7799 began, SCP-7799-4 instances were finally coined as a branch of SCP-7799&#39;s phenomena, inciting thoughts on whether or not SCP-7799-3 was a significant entity or if it was being deliberately untruthful with Foundation personnel regarding its position in what it calls the &#34;X-Insurgency&#34;. 
 
**Addendum:** After a period of &#34;unorthodox methods&#34; on SCP-7799-3 weeks after its official containment, it admitted to once personally knowing another entity, SCP-7799-1. It stated that after a multitude of intricacies between them regarding the purpose of their machine, SCP-7799-A, he took one physical half of the anomaly and used it to create the X-Insurgency, which it says is &#34;fighting for rationality and against the Kaiser&#39;s theocratic tyranny&#34;. It was unknown for an extended period of time what it meant by this. 
 
It then stated that the other physical half of SCP-7799-A was taken by SCP-7799-1, which would result in it fleeing to Langtry, Texas to create SCP-7799 filled with artificial civilians and a military to protect it.[[footnote]] Elaborated thereon. [[/footnote]]
 
The X Insurgency, otherwise known as SCP-7799-4, is a disorganized insurgency that appears to have drastically split up into various splinter groups with rivaling goals shortly after the containment of SCP-7799-3. These splinter groups would prefer to fight SCP-7799-2 instances in formal warfare in warzone hotspots around the easternmost section of SCP-7799 or engage in criminal activity that also negatively impacts civilian communities that happen to be in proximity to these events whether it be physically or economically. The instances themselves wear makeshift military uniforms, and exhibit exact head topography to SCP-7799-3 (see SCP-7799-3 description).
 
SCP-7799-3 is currently contained in --Site-88, Baldwin County, Alabama.-- Site-228, Budapest, Hungary.

++ **ENTITY PROFILE #7799/1**
 
**Entity Description:** SCP-7799-1 from limited observations appears to be a humanoid entity with a large, lidless human eyeball as a substitute for its head and wears a uniform worn by Austrian emperors during the early twentieth century. Despite this, it is capable of speaking Austrian German. 
 
**Discovery:** It was discovered alongside SCP-7799&#39;s discovery and investigation and assumed to be the entity SCP-7799-3 had been referencing to. Other anomalous attributes are unknown, as it only reveals itself on public broadcasts, advertisements, and speeches to artificial civilians that contain copious political propaganda, implying that it is a tyrannical leader of some sort. SCP-7799-1&#39;s current location outside of propaganda campaigns is unknown, but is theorized to live in its personal mansion, the Schönbrunn Palace in SCP-7799&#39;s arrangement of Vienna.
 
**Addendum:** SCP-7799-3 states that SCP-7799-1 during the same time it took half of SCP-7799-A for itself, SCP-7799-1 had done the same and fled to Texas to create SCP-7799. (See ENTITY PROFILE #7799/3). 
 
Additionally, SCP-7799-1 commands the SCP-7799-2 instances of SCP-7799, who act as a military and police force for government-controlled regions of SCP-7799 and are prone to engaging in violent clashes against rivaling SCP-7799-4 instances in either formal warfare or skirmishes by the eastern border. SCP-7799-2 instances are the second largest group of humanoid entities within SCP-7799 and are visually differentiable from the plethora of artificial civilians and SCP-7799-4 instances. Large surveillance cameras serve as a substitute for their heads, as well as wearing 1980s-era Soviet-made uniforms. Each instance is pre-equipped with an M16 rifle and a multi-pool pocket knife.

**Operation Perseus** 
 
Before modern containment procedures were successfully enforced, knowledge of SCP-7799 during its initial discovery was inadequate and project directors were uncertain of how to regulate the situation due to the destructive capabilities of such an anomaly. SCP-7799-3 was contained at this time, however, the armed conflict within persisted.
  
Two months into research, six leading members of the SCP-7799 Containment Project proposed &#34;Operation  Perseus&#34;, an on-foot exploration of the interior of SCP-7799 consisting of several researchers and combat officers supplied with enough rations and weapons to reach the //de facto// &#34;capital city&#34; of SCP-7799, which closely resembled the Austrian city of Vienna, and return back. This team would be codenamed &#34;Perseus&#34;, and use fragments of experimental Foundation technology that had the capability to show live feeds across large distances against anomalous interference. Unfortunately, due to the scarceness of this technology, it could not be outfitted on all of Persues&#39; equipment with the exception of their drones which they would have to plant in areas of interest across SCP-7799. The rest of their equipment was forced to be much more manual and primitive than hoped.
  
This proposal was initially viewed as highly dangerous, and very few showed interest in participating.[[footnote]] The Foundation for many decades has struggled to change the notion amongst its&#39; personnel that exploration logs will not always result in immediate neutralization. [[/footnote]] These few volunteers were fortunately established doyen in this field of Foundation research.[[footnote]] Most of them, at least. [[/footnote]]

**Supply List**
 
Body cameras and vehicle cameras[[footnote]] These cameras are meant for non-live recordings due to SCP-7799&#39;s nature. The SCP-7799 Research and Containment Headquarters would not be able to view it until Perseus returned to base after the exploration.[[/footnote]]
 
Survival equipment such as weather-resistant tents and shake flashlights.
 
Clothing
 
Two weeks worth of food and water
 
Firearms
 
Two Range Rovers armed with offroad bulletproof tires, windows, and doors
 
Gasoline
 
Experimental drones[[footnote]] These were intended to be planted in areas of interest for future explorations without the need for another team. These drones were outfitted with new experimental anomalous technology that has the capability to send live camera feeds free from most anomalous interferences, as mentioned before. However, they would not be able to be used to follow Perseus in fear of damaging or destroying them if a violent encounter were to take place, or an instance noticing it and eliminating it swiftly.[[/footnote]]
  
Transcribers[[footnote]] Intended for use if body camera and vehicle camera displays were to fail. [[/footnote]]

[The two vehicles currently containing the six members of Perseus are driving down a barren desert highway, with a city in the distance covered in a layer of dust and heat waves floating in the air. Doctor Calabasas becomes intrigued at the sight of it and orders Private Dowser, the designated driver of vehicle one, to stop the vehicle on the side of the road so he may exit for a short while to make quick evaluations. Dowser adheres to his command and alerts Private Cap to stop his vehicle likewise. Soon, both cars are parked on the side of the road. Tumbleweeds are seen rolling past them, and no animals can be seen.]
 
[Calabasas is standing in the center of the highway, scanning the city in the distance and tasting his finger to feel the wind. He pulls out a map of 1914 Austria-Hungary and places a compass atop it. He momentarily looks up from the map to confirm his suspicions. Doctor Vladivostok also exits his respective vehicle.]
 
**Vladivostok:** Cal, is there a reason we&#39;ve stopped? 
 
**Calabasas:** Of course. Everything I do has meaning.
 
[A moment of silence between the two. Vladivostok wipes off sweat coming from his head due to the hot desert sun.]
 
**Calabasas:** Aha! I knew it!
 
**Vladivostok:** Knew what?
 
**Calabasas:** If my calculations are correct, then this mission is already on thin ice.
 
**Vladivostok:** What are you talking about?
  
[Calabasas puts the map and compass back in his lab coat.]
 
**Calabasas:** It appears that we&#39;ve entered the territory from the East, and not the West like we&#39;ve been thinking. It seems like this little road trip isn&#39;t going to be as short as we would hope it to be...
 
**Vladivostok:**  Y-your shitting me? Seriously?
 
**Calabasas:** Unfortunately, yes.
 
**Vladivostok:** So we&#39;re fucked?
 
**Calabasas:** I wouldn&#39;t call it that, more like a... minor setback.
 
[Vladivostok appears to be greatly concerned, and begins to personally recollect the journey so far by moving his hands around.]
 
**Calabasas:** Stop that, you look like a caveman.
 
**Vladivostok:** I know geography... as in, I&#39;m really good at it. If we entered this place from the West, then we should be in, you know, the //West//, right? I didn&#39;t fucking flunk geography, Cal-
 
**Calabasas:** Well, it seems a little reversed around here. No issue, just do the exact opposite of what we&#39;re supposed to do. Go West by going East, and vice versa...
  
**Vladivostok:** Listen, the longer it takes to reach this place&#39;s equivalent of Vienna, where the capital should technically be, the longer this exploration is going to be and the longer it&#39;s going to be, the more //supplies// we&#39;ll need, and guess what? We only have supplies for a two-week-long trip. Not a fucking //months//-worth! We need to call this off right away-
 
**Calabasas:** Calm down, Vlad. When I was looking at the map just now, I already determined some &#34;shortcuts&#34; we can take. We&#39;ll be there in no time.
 
**Vladivostok:** If we starve to death, it&#39;s //your// fault.
 
**Calabasas:** Sheesh Vlad, no wonder nobody wants you at Site-120. You never stop whining and crying like a-
 
**Vladivostok:** Hey! Leave that out of this! I-I- shit! I can&#39;t believe you said that when all of this is being recorded, man! Screw you-
 
**Dowser:** Yo! Could you two stop arguing for once? -And Cal, are you done with your &#34;evaluations&#34; or whatever?
 
**Calabasas:** As a matter of fact, yes. Just follow my lead for the remainder of the exploration and we&#39;ll be fine. Vlad, tell HQ[[footnote]] Referring to the military headquarters set up outside of SCP-7799&#39;s outside perimeter. [[/footnote]] about the situation on our way to this lovely city.
 
**Vladivostok:** [Sigh] Fine. 
 
[The two re-enter their respective vehicles and resume the exploration as Vladivostok sends the following transmission to the SCP-7799 research and containment headquarters stationed outside of SCP-7799.]
  
&gt; Exploration Report - Status: Urgent - Type: Informational
&gt;
&gt; Prep evaluations preceding exploration shown to be incorrect. Magnetic directions appear to be reversed to some capacity. Capacity unknown. Nonlethal so far.
&gt;
&gt; Supplies sufficient for two weeks only. Starvation possible. Reminder that air-dropped supplies will be impossible due to anomaly&#39;s regulation of air space. Solutions? Unknown.
&gt;
&gt; Will make use of what we currently have. Over.
 
[The team heads out once again towards the city in view as Vladivostok closes the laptop with an audible sigh. Private Cap, the designated driver of vehicle two, takes notice.]
 
**Cap:** Hey, everything alright?
 
**Vladivostok:** Its nothing.
 
**Cap:** If there&#39;s anything on your chest, you could tell me. You&#39;ve seemed very stressed since this thing started.
 
**Vladivostok:** Listen, there&#39;s nothing on my chest. If there really was, I probably wouldn&#39;t tell you about it right now given the fact that we all have transcribers and cameras on ourselves recording twenty-four-seven. It would just be more trash to transcribe into text, so no.
 
**Cap:** Aight then. My bad.
 
[A moment of silence.]
 
**Cap:** You know, it&#39;s kinda creepy thinking about it.
  
**Vladivostok:** Thinking about what?
 
**Cap:** Having cameras on you that are constantly recording everything you say and do is pretty creepy if you ask me.
 
**Vladivostok:** I guess.

[Calabasas once again orders both designated drivers to stop on the side of the road, despite being less than a mile away from the city. Private Cap and Dowser begrudgingly follow orders.]
 
**Vladivostok:** [Through the radio] Is there a reason why we&#39;ve stopped for the //second time//?
 
**Calabasas:** [Through the radio] I need to be absolutely sure about something. Just give me another minute.
 
**Vladivostok:** About what? It&#39;s a //city//, see the buildings? See the houses? Looks like a //city// to me!
 
**Calabasas:** Be quiet for a second and let me concentrate. Cap, keep an eye on Vlad for me. Make sure he doesn&#39;t wander off. You know how he is. [Chuckle]
 
**Vladivostok:** Screw you. [He hangs up]
 
[Calabasas exits vehicle one and scans the area. He pulls out his map of 1914 Austria-Hungary again and pin-points a specific location on it.]
 
**Calabasas:** This should be the spot. I&#39;m certain.
 
[The rest of Persues approach Calabasas and look at the map alongside him in curiosity, including Sergeant Lancaster, who has been asleep for the entirety of the beginning of the initial drive.]
 
**Lancaster:** So your sayin&#39; we&#39;re //here//? [He points at a dot on the map that reads &#34;Czernowitz&#34;.
 
**Calabasas:** Affirmative.
 
**Lancaster:** Damn, we&#39;re hella far away from &#34;biennah&#34; or whatever the place is supposed to be.
 
**Calabasas:** It&#39;s pronounced &#34;Vienna&#34;, and besides, I already have some shortcuts to the capital in mind. I told Vlad earlier. 
 
**Lancaster:** Remind me why we didn&#39;t just take a chopper to get there. It woulda saved us a whole lotta time.
 
**Calabasas:** A nifty idea, Phil. That&#39;s exactly what most of us back at HQ were thinking, too.
 
**Lancaster:** So why didn&#39;t we?!
 
**Calabasas:** Well, you see here, it turns out this territory has an airspace.. an ADIZ if you will. Or at least, the things running this place think there is. So our two options would be to try and fly out there just to die in a fiery wreck, or go on an on-foot vehicular exploration. As you can tell, we chose the second option.
 
**Lancaster:** I say we shoulda risked it. I ain&#39;t a coward.
 
**Calabasas:** Whatever you say, Phil. Go back to sleep now. Want me to rock you back to bed?
 
**Lancaster:** Get outta here with your high and mighty attitude! I&#39;ve had it up to //here// with how you&#39;ve been treating us like goons so far! We&#39;re professionals just like you, Cal!
 
**Calabasas:** I&#39;m not in the mood for this right now. Go away if you&#39;re not going to contribute to the exploration in any meaningful way right now.
 
[Lancaster storms off with an audible grunt back to vehicle one as Calabasas moves the map closer to Vlad and the Privates.]
 
**Calabasas:** The city marked here is called &#34;Czernowitz&#34;, and if //this// part of the border is where we really entered from instead of all the way over //here// opposite to it, then the city we see just a mile ahead of us //is// &#34;Czernowitz&#34;.
 
**Vladivostok:** That&#39;s not what the city is called nowadays, but sure. In the real world, it&#39;s shared by Ukraine and Romania, so expect most of the locals to probably speak those respective languages. I can speak both, so it&#39;s no problem for me.
  
**Calabasas:** Good to hear that you&#39;re finally being useful to the team, because so far I&#39;ve been forced to do all of the work myself.
 
**Vladivostok:** Screw you, Cal! We&#39;ve been doing our part since we got here, you just haven&#39;t noticed-
  
**Calabasas:** I&#39;ve seen enough to know that I could be doing this myself. [He turns away and mutters under his breath] I could say the same for our personal endeavors, too.
 
**Vladivostok:** I beg your pardon?!
 
**Calabasas:** Nothing. Go back to your designated vehicle.
 
[Vladivostok slowly strolls back to vehicle two, keeping an eye on Calabasas on his way there before shutting the car door. Calabasas returns to vehicle one and Persues embarks towards the city.]

**Written Report**
 
HQ has come to the conclusion that the exploration must continue despite concerns. They send a transmission to Perseus emphasizing more efficient travel routes by taking main highways and limiting their intake of supplies along the way, as well as cutting out multiple locations they planned to document during the exploration in hopes of reaching Vienna in a quicker fashion.

[Perseus enter SCP-7799&#39;s equivalent of Czernowitz (modern-day Chernivtsi) via a side entrance underneath multiple empty freeway overpasses and discover an enigmatic scene. The city itself appears to be much more grey and cloudy than the bright, hot desert biome presented outside of it, although does not appear to be anomalous. The three tall buildings at the city&#39;s center appear dilapidated and have charred sections near their tops, signifying past battles they&#39;ve stood over. Multiple abandoned 1980s-era fast-food restaurants and small businesses surround these three buildings in a scattered fashion, acting like spinning smoke around three towering grey obelisks. In between all of these establishments and businesses lay randomly placed rubble filled with torn concrete and rusted rebar, assumably falling off these structures over time.]
 
[The borders of this city hold hundreds of 1980s suburban homes, strung out next to each other in neat single-file lines. While these homes are in a much less ruined form than the main city standing over them, most houses appear to be boarded up and serve as dwelling places for SCP-7799-4 instances to rest in against the homeowners&#39; consent. Multiple armoured vehicles patrolling the city can be seen coming in and out of abandoned freeways and buildings that serve as military checkpoints guarding against an unknown threat. Perseus have made the collective decision to avoid these specific instances for their safety.]
 
[It has been three hours since Perseus entered the city&#39;s main center, where some civilians can be seen attempting to keep their businesses alive through momentary haggling or using conventional paper money in some rare cases. During this three-hour period, Private Wally, Dowser, and Cap follow Sergeant Lancaster in taking photos of areas of interest as Vladivostok interviews different civilians in their preferred language. However, upon being asked anything regarding the SCP-7799-4 instances that control the area, they politely or awkwardly vacate. Vladivostok has become exhausted from this repetitious cycle.]
 
**Vladivostok:** [Romanian] -a mighty charming story you have there, sir. But you still haven&#39;t answered my question-
 
**???:** [Romanian] It&#39;s a funny story! Definitely! I tell that one to my whole family and all my friends! Ha! Ha! Hahah... [There is a noticeable layer of nervousness in his tone.]
 
**Vladivostok:** Yes, yes. I know. You&#39;ve told me this twice. But you still haven&#39;t told me anything about the smiley-faced guys-
 
**???:** Ha! Ha! It&#39;s a funny story! A-a really funny story for sure! Ha! Ha... uh, g-goodbye now!
 
**Vladivostok:** Wait! I-I still have questions- [The civilian is out of view and has disappeared into the group of people ahead of him.]
 
[Vladivostok lets out an audible sigh and sulks over to Lancaster and the Privates.]
 
**Lancaster:** Get some good pictures, maggots! They better not look like shit! Remember to be aware of your position and lighting!
 
**Wally:** I-I am, sir...
 
**Lancaster:** Then keep doin&#39; it!
 
**Wally:** Y-yes sir- oh hey, Vlad! Got any info on the smiley face things yet?
 
**Vladivostok:** [English] We&#39;re supposed to call them SCP-7799-4 instances, and no, not yet. All we personally know is that they patrol the area and control it. That&#39;s it. Nothing else. Not the //why//, //how//, or //anything else// for that matter. No one around here wants to talk to me about it. They get all weird.
 
**Wally:** That&#39;s unfortunate. Well, good luck with doing that I guess. I have more pictures of rubble and trash to take.
 
**Lancaster:** You&#39;ve been taking pictures of trash?! Take //meaningful// pictures! Go on! Put your back into it! I wanna see some Weegee-type shit!
 
**Wally:** Uh-right on, sir! Apologies!
 
**Lancaster:** Vlad, you got anything on the smiley face thingamajigs?
 
**Vladivostok:** I told this to Wally already but no. Everybody just changes the subject or walks away. I don&#39;t get it.
 
**Calabasas:** Maybe there&#39;s a reason behind that. Vlad, how //do// you ask them about it? Maybe that&#39;s the problem.
 
**Vladivostok:** All I do is start a casual conversation about the city and its history. Then, I ask about &#34;smiley-faced guys&#34; and they get weird about it.
 
**Calabasas:** Are you sure you&#39;re speaking their language properly?
 
**Vladivostok:** Of course I am! I&#39;ve been studying European languages for ten years! I know what they&#39;re saying and they understand me just fine! I&#39;d like to see you stand around and flip-flop between Romanian and Ukrainian for three hours in the musty, sweltering heat even though it&#39;s cloudy as all hell!
 
**Calabasas:** I&#39;d do it with ease if I took the same classes you did. Besides, you always performed subpar at simple tasks, to say the least, hence, why you didn&#39;t get that recent promotion at Site-19.
 
**Vladivostok:** Cal, don&#39;t push it-
 
**Calabasas:** Or the one before that-
 
**Vladivostok:** Cal-
 
**Calabasas:** Or your application to Site-120, which I got an opportunity to work at without //any// application of mine sent to them, and yet, I turned it down because I was in the middle of more important duties at the time. Unlike you, who was //still// my junior researcher.
 
**Vladivostok:** Don&#39;t push me!
 
**Calabasas:** What are you now? The Incredible Hulk?
 
**Vladivostok:** //Why you-//
 
[Wally cuts between the two, keeping them away from each other.]
 
**Wally:** Guys! Stop! Please! This has been going on since the beginning of this god-forsaken trip and we&#39;re all tired of it! Please! Can&#39;t we just get along?!
 
**Calabasas:** Maybe if Vladdy-boy here stops arguing like a first grader and does his damn job, then yes, maybe.
 
**Vladivostok:** Maybe if Cal stops pushing me around, then I&#39;ll get over it!
 
**Lancaster:** Enough! Vlad, you go away for a minute! You two obviously need space. Would that be okay with you, sir?
 
**Calabasas:** Yes. Much appreciated as a matter of fact.
 
**Lancaster:** Aight then. Vlad, fuck off for a while, please.
 
**Vladivostok:** Fine. I&#39;m going back to the car. I&#39;ll radio in if anything happens to me, which I doubt any of you would care if-
 
**Lancaster:** Just fuck off and stop whining! Damn!
 
[Vladivostok storms off while throwing his hands in the air as he returns to vehicle two parked underneath a bridge 100 meters away from them.]
 
**Wally:** Wow.
 
**Lancaster:** Is he always like this?
 
**Calabasas:** Nothing else.
 
**Lancaster:** Damn, may god have mercy on your soul with such a shitty burden.
 
**Calabasas:** Thanks. He just always denies the fact that I&#39;m better than him at everything. He needs to remember that we&#39;re not friends anymore. Just associates. He&#39;s my lackey, and I&#39;m his master.
 
**Lancaster:** And are //we// your lackeys too?
 
**Calabasas:** During this exploration, yes. So get used to it, Phil.
 
**Lancaster:** Whatever, asshole.
 
[Perseus take a few more photos of areas of interest and return to their vehicles to see the rest of the city. Vladivostok checks their terminal and sees the following transmission from HQ:]
 
&gt; Urgent message received successfully.
&gt;
&gt; Incorrect prep estimations resulting in current situation understood.
&gt;
&gt;  Resolutions scarce. Uknown if supply airlift will be success. Risk factor? High.
&gt;
&gt; Safest resolution? Cancel exploration. Recommended course of action? Continue exploration. 
&gt; 
&gt; Request: Cancel multiple trips to different cities besides the capital city.
&gt;
&gt; Immediate response required. 
 
[Vladivostok sends back the following transmission:]
 
&gt; Response received. Disagree with safest solution. 
&gt;
&gt; Documentation of anomaly so far successful. New information regarding SCP-7799-4 gained. Amount? Moderate.
&gt;
&gt; Camping spot determined. Safety? Personally debatable. Agree to disagree. Calabasas believes it to be efficient.
&gt;
&gt; Supplies still copious for a fortnight. Unknown if it will last for a trip of three to four cities. Will cut down this number as requested.
&gt;
&gt; Will continue to send updates as needed. Decision to cancel? Not final.

[Perseus has now entered what appears to be a dusty, deserted section of the city that contains a large concrete jungle wasteland with an abandoned industrial park to the west of it. The grey overlay over everything in sight has not disappeared yet and appears to be much stronger than before. Despite this, Perseus trudge through abandoned roads and freeways until finding a small gas station to the side of the road with some inhabitants making light conversation around it. This gas station is close to the official border of the city, and Calabasas takes notice and commands Dowser and Cap to pull over next to it. Although tired, they oblige. Vladivostok and the privates are sent into it to gain last-second pictures to meet their quota for the day.]
 
[Inside the gas station, there appears to be little to no food left on the shelves, with the food remaining being rotten and expired. An old man sits in a rocking chair toward the corner of the room, next to the clerk&#39;s counter with one young man behind it reading a magazine about automobiles with his feet kicked up. Persues take around four pictures and the three privates return to their vehicles while Dowser specifically goes out to place a drone in a secluded area for future observations, leaving Vladivostok by himself inside the store.]
 
[Vladivostok passes by the station clerk&#39;s counter before being questioned by the man behind it.]
 
**???:** [Romanian] You! Boy! 
 
[Vladivostok turns around in surprise.]
 
**Vladivostok:** Oh... me?
 
**???:** Yeah you! Are you gonna buy something?! If not, get out!
 
**Vladivostok:** [Romanian] I-I mean, uh... I... had a question!
 
[An awkward moment of silence between the two.]
 
**???:** A... question?
 
**Vladivostok:** Yeah, about the... smiley-faced guys. They have the big, uh, yellow heads with smiley faces on them. Those guys.
 
[The clerk looks around for a second, and looks back at Vladivostok again with a hint of suspicion in his expression.]
 
**???:** What&#39;s it to you?
 
**Vladivostok:** Personal interest.
 
**???:** [Sigh] I mean, they&#39;ve been around here for as long as I can remember, I guess. We let them do what they want to do and they leave us alone as much as they can. That&#39;s it. I recommend that you don&#39;t go around asking about it anymore-
 
**??? #2:** [Romanian] The X-Insurgency! That thems name! X-Insurgency! Hundreds of thems deny its, but it&#39;s theys name! X-Insurgency! They control everything! Everything!  
 
[Both the clerk and Vladivostok are startled by the old man&#39;s sudden outburst.]
 
**Vladivostok:** X-Insurgency?
 
**??? #2:** Yes! Its they name! Theys around here deny its but its theys name!
 
[Vladivostok turns back to the store clerk.]
 
**Vladivostok:** So they&#39;re called the X-Insurgency? Is that true?
  
**???:** [Sigh] As much of a loon old Darko over there is, yes. They used to go by the name &#34;X-Insurgency&#34;-
 
**??? #2:** And then theys leader got kidnapped-ed and now theys scrambled-ed and theys making powder-es to get by!
 
**Vladivostok:** What does he mean by that? Powder? Scramble?
 
**???:** [Another sigh] Their supposed &#34;leader&#34; got, uh, [He looks around for a moment] //kidnapped// and then they got &#34;scattered&#34;, and now live a life of crime to get by. Around these parts, they make //crack//... a whole lot of it, too.
 
**??? #2:** And the polices and the army-es are on thems payrolls on Vienna banknotes-es! Theys making hundreds of thousands a year!
 
**???:** And they make thousands every year doing it. Even some of the cops and army are on their payroll. That&#39;s it. Nothing else.
 
**Vladivostok:** Oh, really?
 
**??? #2:** The war is raging on for decades-es now! The wars-es here are raging on cause of thems dirtys soldiers and cops! Wes stuck here forever in war!
 
**???:** Damn it, there he goes again. I ought to call Mary and tell her that her grandpa&#39;s having another episode. [He reaches for a telephone mounted on the wall next to him that appears to be choppily welded on.]
 
[Vladivostok approaches the old man with intrigue.]
 
**Vladivostok:** Hey, uh, mind if you told me a little more about these guys?
 
**??? #2&#34;** X-Insurgency controls everything! Everything! We&#39;s dead and we&#39;s don&#39;t even know it!
 
**Vladivostok:** Uh, right... so, me and some of my friends back here are trying to get to Vienna and, uh, we were hoping that you would give us some directions to get there. You know, to get there faster?
 
[The old man is silent, and stares blankly at nothing.]
 
**Vladivostok:** So here&#39;s the map... [He pulls out a copy of a map of 1914 Austria-Hungary] so we&#39;re here and hoping we could cut right through Northern Transylvania to get to Budapest without-
 
**???: #2:** Transylvania! War! There&#39;s wars in Transylvania! Yous be dead in an instant! Instant! Dead! Instant!
 
**Vladivostok:** What?
 
**??? #2:** Transylvania is war-topia! War-topia is the wars of all wars out there! Nothing but deaths and killings and //bombs// in Transylvania... and //hellfire//!
 
[A woman enters the store and begins to help the old man up.]
 
**??? #3:** [Romanian] Oh, don&#39;t mind him. He&#39;s just a little looney is all. Sorry if he spooked you... c&#39;mon, grandpa. It&#39;s time to go home...
 
**??? #2:** Don&#39;t go out there! Yous and yous friends be dead soon! Soon I tell you!
 
**???:** Thanks for getting him started. Get out of my store, kid.
 
**Vladivostok:** But I-
 
**???:** I got a piece under my counter, you wanna see it? Get out!
  
[Vladivostok reluctantly exits the shop and returns to vehicle two discouraged before being approached by Calabasas.]
 
**Calabasas:** What the hell took you so damn long?! Did you get lost in there you fool?!
 
**Vladivostok:** [English] No! I was just... interviewing someone.
 
**Calabasas:** Who?
 
**Vladivostok:** Some old guy in there and the store clerk told me a bit about the SCP-7799-4 instances.
 
**Calabasas:** [His eyes widen] Wait, really? What did they say?
 
**Vladivostok:** Well, apparently, they&#39;re called the &#39;X-Insurgency&#34;, or at least, used to be called that... then-
 
**Calabasas:** &#34;X-Insurgency&#34;? Sounds like something from a dumb action movie.
 
**Vladivostok:** -then he told me how they make crack around these parts and how the army and cops were in on it. Or some of them I should say-
 
**Calabasas:** The SCP-7799-2 instances, correct? The camera things?
 
**Vladivostok:** Yes, I think he was referring to them.
  
**Calabasas:** You&#39;re not making any sense here... you know what? You&#39;re too unreliable. Just show me your body cam footage when we set up camp, okay? I&#39;m not dealing with your incompetence right now.
 
**Vladivostok:** What do you mean, &#34;incompetence&#34;? I&#39;ve been doing my job! 
 
**Calabasas:** So you&#39;re job is to whine and be a nuisance to me? Man, I can&#39;t work with you sometimes. Why are you always trying to act like you&#39;re on my level? You never will be. Come to think of it, why have I even been paired with you again?
 
**Vladivostok:** You wouldn&#39;t be here if it wasn&#39;t for us working together! 
  
**Calabasas:** You were just my sidekick to get to the top. Now that my position and future opportunities are sealed, I don&#39;t need you anymore. Get out of my sight. 
 
**Vladivostok:** C&#39;mon man... I-I thought we were friends... I thought... we were friends... 
 
[Vladivostok turns away and looks up with staggering breath to hold back sobs. He storms off back to vehicle two with Calabasas watching.]
   
**Calabasas:** [Laughs] Fucking pathetic. Can&#39;t wait to watch this video feed every day with coffee once we&#39;re done! 
 
[Calabasas returns to his designated vehicle and waits for Dowser&#39;s return after planting the drone. Soon after, Perseus finally exit Czernowitz through an abandoned freeway exit tunnel 1500 meters from where they stopped. The barren, hot desert sun re-appears along with the layer of dust and occasional tumbleweeds being carried by the wind.]

**Written Report** 
 
A transmission from Perseus to HQ states that they have now exited Czernowitz and are back on the road toward SCP-7799&#39;s arrangement of Budapest. A small office party in the SCP-7799 Research and Containment Headquarters is set up to commemorate Perseus&#39; safe traveling in SCP-7799.

[Perseus have returned to traveling down a barren desert road which Calabasas infers to be a path that will lead them to the southern end of SCP-7799&#39;s equivalent of Bosnia and Herzegovina. No notable events occur during this time frame, with the exception of occasional gasoline refilling and quick photographing. Some members of Perseus occasionally attempt to fall asleep, but cannot due to the bumpy terrain. Throughout the trip, various dilapidated billboards can be seen placed on the side of the road, victim to mild vandalization.]
 
[The first billboard shows SCP-7799-1 sitting on a leather chair in front of a fireplace holding a Diet Pepsi brand soda can as small children gather around it as if it were a parental figure. Italicized text above the scene reads //&#34;Kaiser-approved beverage for the kids!&#34;// Another one less than a mile away from the first shows SCP-7799-1 next to movie character Robocop, with bold text above the two that reads: //&#34;Obey the law!&#34;// Lancaster in vehicle one takes notice.]
 
**Lancaster:** What&#39;s the eyeball thing that I&#39;ve been seeing on these adverts on the side of the road?
 
**Dowser:** What?
 
**Lancaster:** The eyeball-looking thing! See! [He points to a billboard that contains SCP-7799-1 and celebrity Hulk Hogan posing for a picture.]
 
**Dowser:** That thing? I dunno. Cal, what is that thing? 
 
**Calabasas:** That //thing// is apparently the &#34;leader&#34; of this territory. It&#39;s also anomalous.
 
**Lancaster:** I ain&#39;t ever seen no leader look like a freak.
 
[Perseus drive by a small desert basin less than 150 meters away from the road they are currently on.]
 
**Calabasas:** That looks like a nice spot to set up camp. Let&#39;s stop there.
 
**Lancaster:** In that basin?
 
**Calabasas:** Affirmative.
 
**Lancaster:** Are you crazy?! We&#39;ll be in the wide open! Whoever finds us immediately has high-ground!
 
**Calabasas:** Pipe down. It&#39;s far enough away from the road for someone to drive past without looking down and at the same time isn&#39;t too deep to get trapped in.
 
**Lancaster:** Listen to me! This ain&#39;t a good idea!
 
**Calabasas:** Who&#39;s in charge again? That&#39;s right, //me//. I&#39;m the intellectual powerhouse of this team, and you&#39;re just the simple-minded brute with three goons who&#39;ll probably be dead by the time we get halfway through this place!  
 
**Dowser:** W-wait, what?!
 
**Lancaster:** Fine. But you don&#39;t have to be a dick about it.
 
**Calabasas:** Bold words for a goon like you. I hope you don&#39;t talk to your supervisors or drill sergeant like that.
 
**Lancaster:** I don&#39;t.
 
**Calabasas:** Then I&#39;d like a little more respect for the work I&#39;m doing now and have done in the past for this organization.
 
**Lancaster:** Alright. Fine. I apologize.
 
**Calabasas:** Good. You&#39;re not forgiven, either.
 
[Dowser radios to vehicle two behind them that they will be setting up camp in the basin nearby. Soon after, the team drives into it via a smooth, flat incline leading towards it like a canyon passageway leading into a grotto.]
 
**Calabasas:** This looks comfy, doesn&#39;t it? 
 
**Lancaster:** Seems like I&#39;ll get sand in my ass when I go to bed. 
 
**Calabasas:** That&#39;s a //you// problem, Phil. Now help the rest get everything set up out here. I expect my tent to be ready in no less than half an hour. 
 
**Lancaster:** Sure thing, boss. Are you gonna help? 
 
**Calabasas:** No, I&#39;m going to watch the process unfold. Now go along, do your job.
 
[Lancaster walks away grumbling. Calabasas stands proud at the bottom of this basin with the light reflecting across his white lab coat.]
 
**Calabasas:** &#34;Doctor Roger Calabasas, level four researcher&#34;... &#34;Doctor Roger Calabasas, Overseer Councilman&#34;...

**Written Report** 
 
HQ has sent another transmission to Perseus requesting information on the state of their rations. Doctor Bimston, head of the SCP-7799 Research and Containment Project, remarks on the exploration as &#34;one of the most successful on-foot Foundation exploration in the organization&#39;s history&#34;.

[Persues, after less than an hour successfully prop up three survival tents near their two parked vehicles, with tent one belonging to the three privates, tent two serving as Lancaster&#39;s and Vladivostok&#39;s, and tent three serving as Calabasas&#39;. For the remaining two and a half hours, Perseus have been debating amongst each other how they will extend their supplies&#39; longevity for a trip to three and if not four different cities across a large desert. They come to an agreement to not visit Sarajevo, Prague, or Zagreb in the north and south of SCP-7799 in exchange for visiting Budapest, and Vienna. Afterward, they will exit out of SCP-7799 by continuing in that general direction until reaching its wall and subsequentially escaping.]
  
[Currently, Perseus has prepared themselves for rest. The three privates plan on circulating their night duty responsibility amongst each other by having one private stay awake outside the tents for two hours before sending the next private on guard duty and so on. Meanwhile, Vladivostok is currently in Calabasas&#39; personal tent, reviewing his body cam footage with him on the team&#39;s laptop to examine what occurred within the gas station before.]
 
 **???: #2:** [Video] {{Transylvania! War! There&#39;s wars in Transylvania! Yous be dead in an instant! Instant! Dead! Instant!}}
 
**Vladivostok:** [Video] {{What?}}
 
**??? #2:** [Video] {{Transylvania is war-topia! War-topia is the wars of all wars out here! Nothing but deaths and killings and //bombs// in Transylvania... and //hellfire//!}}
 
[Calabasas rewinds this specific scene, repeatedly, examining it thoroughly. The old man&#39;s screechy voice fills the laptop speakers.]
 
**Calabasas:** After finally being able to tepidly believe your translation reliability, I&#39;m starting to grasp the main idea presented here. The X-Insurgency, the crack, the war, but this part here intrigues me...
 
**Vladivostok:** What do you mean? Also, may I remind you I studied European languages for ten-
 
**Calabasas:**  It&#39;s strange how it talks about the war in Czernowitz with not as much exclamation as he did when talking about the &#34;war in Transylvania&#34;. I mean, we didn&#39;t see any &#34;war&#34; there, but we saw insurgents for sure...
 
**Vladivostok:** Okay?
 
**Calabasas:** ... but it becomes more distressed than before when talking about the &#34;war in Transylvania&#34;. What could possibly be going on over there that&#39;s somehow worse than what&#39;s happening in Czernowitz? Which, according to what //we// saw, while still in a bad state, isn&#39;t //as// bad as we thought it would be.
 
**Vladivostok:** You heard him-I mean, //it// say it though, right? I think this place&#39;s equivalent to Transylvania is the most war-focused area.
 
**Calabasas:** I don&#39;t buy it. If this whole &#34;war&#34; is nothing but dispersed squabbles between ghetto drug manufacturers then I think this place&#39;s Transylvania will be no different than what we saw in Czernowitz.
 
**Vladivostok:** Interesting hypothesis you got there. But you heard the thing, or heard it from me the //translator//, but that doesn&#39;t matter. It says there&#39;s nothing but all-out war there. A &#34;war-topia&#34; it described it as. If you ask me, that doesn&#39;t sound very appealing.
 
**Calabasas:** So what are you saying?
 
**Vladivostok:** We should probably stay away from Transylvania.
 
**Calabasas:** No, we&#39;re not. The quickest shortcut to Budapest will require us to cut into it for a bit and then leave north. That&#39;s it. [He pulls up the 1914 map of Austria-Hungary and points to the path. Vladivostok pushes it away.]
 
**Vladivostok:** The thing literally lives here. I think it&#39;ll probably know more than we &#34;visitors&#34; know about the territory-
 
**Calabasas:** You&#39;re a nutcase if you think I&#39;m believing anything that comes out the mouth of an entity that looks like some crazy old man!  
 
**Vladivostok:** We&#39;re scientist! We&#39;re not supposed to say crazy-
 
**Calabasas:** Shut it! These civilians are not as reliable as pure knowledge like this here expertly designed map of mine has, and my //own// intellect up //here//. [He points to his head.]
 
**Vladivostok:** It&#39;s common sense based on what I heard! Is there anything wrong with that?
 
**Calabasas:** In the real world, no. But here, yes! There&#39;s something definitely wrong with that!
 
**Vladivostok:** I think we should consider them primary sources!
 
**Calabasas:** Is that the case? Then I, the official leader of this exploration, declare them secondary unreliable sources of information! There, problem solved! Now get your laptop and get out of my tent!
 
**Vladivostok:** But Cal-
 
**Calabasas:** I&#39;m not in the mood! 
 
**Vladivostok:** Well... maybe you&#39;re not as smart as you think, and-and maybe you should take in other people&#39;s thoughts for once!
 
**Calabasas:** Damn it! You don&#39;t understand!
 
[Calabasas sighs and rubs his eyes.]
 
**Calabasas:** I can&#39;t believe that the most career-defining moment of my life is being //ruined// by you! How did I even get grouped with you again?! 
 
**Vladivostok:** I signed up because I knew you did too! 
 
[Calabasas is silent.]
  
**Calabasas:** Excuse me? 
 
**Vladivostok:** I-I did it becuase... I wanted to prove myself to you and-
 
**Calabasas:** Are you fucking insane! This team was meant to have professional and promising talent behind it, A.K.A, //me//! Now you&#39;re here and this whole thing is ruined! 
 
**Vladivostok:** I-I&#39;m sorry, I... 
 
[Vladivostok holds back tears.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** I just.. wanted to impress you so we could still be friends. 
  
**Calabasas:** And now we pay for your insolence! You&#39;re a fool! 
 
**Vladivostok:** Yeah, I know... I&#39;m sorry... 
 
**Calabasas:** You&#39;re a burden! 
 
**Vladivostok:** I know... 
 
**Calabasas:** A worthless nobody! 
 
**Vladivostok:** I know, I know... 
 
[Vladivostok stares at the ground with sad eyes. Calabasas sighs and rubs his head.] 
 
**Calabasas:** Just... get out of my sight. 
 
**Vladivostok:** Look, I&#39;m sorry, I shouldn&#39;t have-
 
**Calabasas:** What are you still doing here?! Get the fuck out! 
 
[Vladivostok hurriedly leaves the tent with the laptop. Calabasas adjusts his silk pajamas and nightcap.]
 
**Calabasas:** Why me, Lord... why me, Lord... why me?...

[Most of Perseus, excluding the three privates, are fast asleep under the warm desert air that occasionally whistles by their tents and vehicles, which house their supplies. The moon above them appears to be small tonight, and thick clouds move above and below it like ocean waves. The desert landscape is considerably dark and no natural wildlife or insects can still be found, creating an uneasy sight of a thick darkness surrounding a dimly lit basin.]
 
[The three privates continue to keep their composure despite the unsettling environment around them, occasionally going on alert whenever the wind howls above them, unsure if the sound they are hearing is a car passing by on the desert road near them or if it is only the wind. Private Cap is currently moseying around the camp, looking up at the top of the basin and the darkness around the dim lamps placed aimlessly around the camp while the two other privates are on their sleeping break.]
 
[However, Cap takes a moment to stand still, stopping the distinct sound of desert sand crunching and squishing under his feet. The sound occurs again, although not from Cap.]
 
[He immediately turns his head to the left, holding his breath, eyes widened. The sound occurs once more in thrice fashion. Cap discerns the sound coming from behind one of the team&#39;s Range Rovers, where it suddenly stops. Cap calls out into the darkness.]
 
**Cap:** Hey, Phil! Is that you?
 
[Silence.]
 
**Cap:** Dowser?
 
[Silence.]
 
**Cap:** Wally?
 
[The sound of desert sand crunching underneath boots comes from behind the vehicle.]
 
**Cap:** Hey, uh... hello? Is that one of you guys?
 
[He approaches the vehicle and peers over the hood to the other side. Nothing. However, upon crouching below the vehicle&#39;s doorstep and looking underneath the car itself, he sees a pair of brown leather work boots.]
 
[He freezes for a brief moment. Before he can say anything, a hand comes down next to the boots. This hand appears to be holding a Beretta pistol, and opens fire.]
 
**Cap:** [Unintelligable, as he appears to fall backward as the assailant&#39;s firearm clips the audio. However, a distinct scream can be barely heard underneath the sounds.]
 
[Wally and Dowser rush out of the tent they were currently resting in.]
 
**Wally:** What the fuck?!
 
**Dowser:** Who&#39;s that?!
 
**Cap:** [Radio] Somebody&#39;s here! Somebody&#39;s here! Intruder alert! Intruder alert!
 
[Dowser and Wally split up around the camp as Cap crawls and trips his way behind a supply crate. Meanwhile, Lancaster rushes to the scene and takes cover.]
 
**Lancaster:** Damn it! I told Cal this shit would happen! [He pulls out his Glock pistol and rushes for cover].
 
[While the initial assailant has dug in behind vehicle one, four more assailants reveal themselves at the top of the basin, raining down bullets with AK-47s onto the camp and shattering objects. These assailants have revealed themselves to be SCP-7799-4 instances due to their distinct, round, yellow smiley-face heads.]
 
**Lancaster:** [Radio] Motherfuckers have us surrounded! We gotta dig in for a siege! Don&#39;t leave cover!
 
[Vladivostok pokes his head out of his designated tent.]
 
**Vladivostok:** What&#39;s going on?! 
 
**Lancaster:** [In the distance] Take cover now you idiot, you&#39;ll get your head shot off!  
 
**Vladivostok:** Shit! No! 
 
[Vladivostok sprints out and hides between a large stack of crates, covering his head as bullets whiz past him.]  
 
**Cap:** [Radio] Phil, Get a full auto! You won&#39;t hit shit with that thing!
 
[Lancaster shoots one of the instances at the top of the basin in a perfect headshot, causing its lifeless body to pummel towards the bottom and land on a rock, spraying blood over it.]
 
**Lancaster:** [Radio] I&#39;m fine maggot! Don&#39;t worry about //my// ass and worry about //yours//!
 
[Calabasas awakes from his soft blow-up mattress and heating blanket in anger, taking off his eye mask and putting on his slippers.]
 
**Calabasas:** Fucking stupid. I do all this hard work for the team and //this// is how they repay me? By ruining my required sleep?! Oh, they&#39;ll be sorry once I give them a piece of my mind! 
 
[Calabasas exits his tent.]
 
**Calabasas:** All right, which one of you-
 
[Gunshots whiz past Calabasas.]
 
**Calabasas:** What the hell- //SHIT! SHIT! WHAT THE FUCK?!//
 
[He dives back into his tent, hiding behind his microwave and TV dinners with his hands covering the top of his head as gunshots shoot holes into the tent.]
 
**Dowser:** [Radio] I&#39;m going in to save Cal! Hold on!
 
[Dowser quickly crouch-walks towards Calabasas&#39; tent, where he lifts up the collapsed tent tarp on top of him and drags him behind more supply crates.]
 
**Calabasas:** //PROTECT ME YOU FUCKING HALF-WIT! THAT&#39;S WHAT YOU&#39;RE PAID FOR!//
  
**Dowser:** I am, sir! Hold on!
 
[Dowser waits for the instances at the top of the basin edge to reload, before peeking out of cover and aiming carefully at a specific spot. As an SCP-7799-4 instance&#39;s big smiley face head pops up at this exact spot, Dowser pulls the trigger and pummels its head with NATO cartridges. It falls down to the bottom of the basin with a loud &#34;THUMP!&#34;]
 
[Vladivostok fumbles around in the pockets of his sweatpants for his radio.]
 
**Vladivostok:** [Radio] Do you read me?! What the hell is happening?!
 
**Lancaster:** [Radio] We&#39;re getting jumped, that&#39;s what&#39;s happening! Can you see me from here?!
 
**Vladivostok:** [Radio] I don&#39;t know! I don&#39;t wanna poke my head out!
 
[Vladivostok is the furthest away from the rest of the team, hiding behind a large stack of supply crates near the team&#39;s two Range Rovers.]
 
[Vladivostok, even through the sounds of gunfire behind him, can barely hear the sound of electric zapping coming from one of their vehicles. Specifically, vehicle two. He pokes his head around the corner and sees the initial SCP-7799-4 instance who attacked Private Cap. Its bright yellow head can be seen shuffling around the driver&#39;s seat, attempting to hotwire the vehicle.]
 
**Lancaster:** [Radio] Vlad, can you see me?! Are you still alive?!
 
**Vladivostok:** [Radio] They&#39;re trying to take one of the cars!
 
**Lancaster:** [Radio] What?!
 
**Vladivostok:** [Radio] Car two! Car two! It&#39;s //right there!//
 
[The vehicle&#39;s engine starts and roars as the instance slams the acceleration pedal full-speed ahead towards a rock, crashing into it. It backs up, being pummeled with bullets from Lancaster&#39;s Glock aiming at its bulletproof windows to no avail. The car spins around in disarray across the camp, sending clouds of dust toward the eyes of the privates, stopping them from retaliating against it. It knocks down multiple crates and runs over Calabasas&#39; tent before speeding up the slanted dirt path the team used to get to the bottom of the basin when it was first found. The two instances at the top of the basin stop shooting and make a run for it likewise.]
 
**Lancaster:** [Radio] They&#39;re gettin&#39; away! C&#39;mon, maggots! No prisoners of war!
 
**Dowser:** Affirmative!  
 
[Lancaster and two privates chase after the instances up the slanted dirt path exit as Cap stays behind to protect Vladivostok and Calabasas.]
 
**Vladivostok:** Our laptop&#39;s in there! It&#39;s our only way of contacting HQ, we can&#39;t lose it! 
 
**Calabasas:** We need it back! Stop them! 
 
**Cap:** We know! Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll get them!
 
**Calabasas:** No, you don&#39;t understand! We //need// that car back!
 
[Calabasas runs off in the direction of Lancaster and the rest of the privates.]
 
**Cap:** Wait, come back!
 
[Cap and Vladivostok chase after Calabasas.]
 
[Lancaster, Dowser, and Wally reach the top of the basin back to the desert floor, seeing the two instances escape in a white pickup truck alongside the instance driving their stolen vehicle.]
 
**Lancaster:** Don&#39;t let &#39;em get away!
 
[They open fire on the retreating instances, who are now driving off into the far distance to the left.]
 
**Dowser:** They&#39;re too far! We&#39;ve lost them!
 
**Lancaster:** Dammit! Where&#39;s the fucking tracer rounds, then?!
 
**Cap:** We don&#39;t have any tracer rounds!
 
**Lancaster:** Bullshit!
 
[Calabasas sprints past Lancaster and the two privates towards the now evanescent instances.]
 
**Calabasas:** No... no!
 
**Lancaster:** Come back!
 
[Calabasas runs aimlessly for a couple more meters before collapsing to his knees, sitting in the sand in anger and grief.]
 
**Calabasas:** //NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!//
 
[He throws one of his pink bunny slippers at the now-escaped instances and digs his face into his hands before weeping. The rest of Perseus approach him.]
 
**Lancaster:** What are you crying about, boss?! We kicked their asses!
 
**Calabasas:** No you didn&#39;t! They got away! They //attacked// us and they got away with it! You know how //stupid// we look letting that happen! 
 
**Lancaster:** We&#39;re all still alive, ain&#39;t we?! That&#39;s our job!
 
**Calabasas:** You clodpolls don&#39;t understand anything! Our computer was in there and now we have no way of contacting HQ! You were meant to //guard// the camp! 
 
**Lancaster:** Listen, boss! We did our best! It all happened so fast! 
 
[Vladivostok and Cap finally catch up to the scene unfolding.] 
  
**Calabasas:** It&#39;s his fault! [He points to Vladivostok.]
 
**Vladivostok:** What?! 
 
**Calabasas:** He had the computer last night! It&#39;s //his// fault that it&#39;s gone! It&#39;s //his// fault that we&#39;re all gonna die! 
 
**Lancaster:** Sir- 
 
**Calabasas:** Enough of you! We&#39;re going out to search for this thing even if it&#39;s the last thing we do! 
 
**Lancaster:** Sir, our contingency plan has already been on thin ice since you came up with it! We can&#39;t just go out into the middle of nowhere in the dead of night! 
 
**Calabasas:** If I say we will, then we will! My permanent record will be ruined if we can&#39;t salvage this! 
 
**Lancaster:** Sir- 
 
**Calabasas:** We&#39;re going out to get that car back, whatever it takes! 
 
**Dowser:** It&#39;s three in the morning and it&#39;s creepy as hell out here! 
 
**Calabasas:** I&#39;m not hearing any of your excuses! Car! Now! 
 
[Calabasas storms off back to the basin as the rest follow suit.] 
 
**Lancaster:** [To Vladivostok] Thanks a lot, Jackass! Now we&#39;ll be tired all day! 
 
**Dowser:** Yeah, thanks. Really appreciate it. 
 
**Vladivostok:** I&#39;m sorry... I-I&#39;m sorry for everything...
 
[They return to camp and clean up before going off to find the perpetrators. The dark landscape appears to be much more prominent than before.]

[Doctor Pen, head of intelligence is seen sitting at his terminal with a hint of worry on his expression. A janitor behind him cleans the floor covered in confetti and deflated balloons from the party yesterday as Dr. Bimston walks in.]
 
**Bimston:** Any new transmissions sent by Perseus? 
 
**Pen:** Nothing. 
 
**Bimston:** Nothing, huh? 
 
[Bimston sighs and pulls a chair toward him to sit in.] 
 
**Pen:** I don&#39;t understand. They were doing so well keeping us updated, now they&#39;re giving us the silent treatment. 
 
**Bimston:** Strange.
 
[The two are silent for another moment.] 
 
**Bimston:** Maybe send them another message? 
 
**Pen:** I guess so, but I doubt that&#39;ll do anything. Who knows? They&#39;re probably dead. 
 
**Bimston:** Let&#39;s try and think a little more positively than that. We&#39;ll come to that conclusion if the evidence for it rears its ugly head. 
 
**Pen:** I hope it won&#39;t because it&#39;ll definitely be one ugly head.  
 
**Bimston:** Yeah. 
 
[Bimston pulls out a folder from his coat and places it next to Pen.] 
 
**Pen:** What is this supposed to be? 
 
**Bimston:** More paperwork. 
 
**Pen:** [Sigh] Seriously? What for this time? I thought I took care of everything before this exploration started.
 
**Bimston:** Just some outside observations. 
 
**Pen:** Oh, //those// observations. [Groan] I don&#39;t even know why we have to look out for these things. Let me guess, another dog taking a piss by the building? 
 
**Bimston:** No, actually. It&#39;s about some underground tunnels nearby. They sent some agents to look around this morning. 
 
**Pen:** Underground tunnels? Bimston, that&#39;s just the work of the construction site in Langtry. They&#39;re building a... what&#39;s it called again... well, they&#39;re building something, and it&#39;s most likely just from them. So don&#39;t worry about it. 
 
**Bimston:** I&#39;m not. It&#39;s part of the job. 
 
**Pen:** I really wish it wasn&#39;t. 
 
[Bimston rubs his hands together before sitting up and leaving the room. Pen types away at his terminal as the janitor continues to clean up the colorful mess on the floor.]

[BEGIN LOG]
  
[Perseus are currently back on the empty desert road going in the general direction of where the SCP-7799-4 instances that robbed them went. Calabasas&#39; attitude towards the team and the exploration as a whole has deteriorated greatly as the rest of the team are tired and exhausted from looking at the bright desert landscape for a long lost possession.] 
 
[The team itself have now become a one-vehicle convoy, with most of their supplies stuffed haphazardly into the trunk and backseat. Dowser pilots the vehicle itself, with Calabasas sitting in the passenger seat. The rest of the team sit in the backseat without seatbelts, holding onto supplies to stop them from tumbling around the interior.]
 
[According to Vladivostok&#39;s estimations, he suspects they have entered SCP-7799&#39;s arrangement of Transylvania due to the familiar roaming-hill landscape that can be found in Transylvania to this day. However, SCP-7799&#39;s arrangement of it appears to replace the dark green valleys and forests with another dry desert with rough, rocky hills bleached from exposure to the sun. Unusually, the tumbleweeds that were once occasionally carried by the wind appear to be out of sight now, including the bright yellow and orange desert colors fading into light shades of grey due to clouds forming over the sun. Despite this, the hot air persists. Heat waves can be seen dancing on the horizon.]
 
[As Lancaster and the privates attempt to sneak in some rest for every blink they manage, loud bangs coming from an unknown location far away from them go off at random intervals without any discernable pattern.]
  
**Cap:** The fuck is that noise? 
 
**Calabasas:** What? You mean that thunder? 
 
**Cap:** That isn&#39;t thunder, man. It&#39;s like an explosion going off somewhere. 
 
**Lancaster:** That shit&#39;s starting to drive me nuts, sir. Should we investigate the noise? 
 
**Calabasas:** Sure, I guess we could. Not like we&#39;ll find those pieces of shit at this rate. 
 
**Dowser:** That&#39;s what we&#39;ve been saying! Could we please just stop to rest?! Just for a little while?! Please?! 
 
**Calabasas:** We go to bed at dark like normal human beings. 
 
**Dowser:** Well, could we at least have a snack to keep us going? I got a wicked migraine coming on. 
  
**Calabasas:** No! 
 
[Silence amongst Perseus as Dowser drives off the desert road toward the source of the bangs.] 
 
**Calabasas:** Remember where the highway is, too. We&#39;re just taking a look, that&#39;s it. If it&#39;s not worth a picture or recording, then we head right back onto the road. 
 
**Vladivostok:** We understand. 
 
[A long moment of uncomfortable silence.] 
 
**Calabasas:** Could someone give me some water? 
 
**Lancaster:** I thought you said nobody could eat nothin&#39; outside of breakfast and dinner. 
 
**Calabasas:** That rule excludes me. Give some water, now-
 
[The banging resumes, this time in quick succession.]
 
**Vladivostok:** What was that? 
 
**Calabasas:** Just sounds like thunder to me. It //is// getting cloudy by the looks of it, another reason to just turn back around. As a matter of fact, let&#39;s just go back. This is a fucking waste of time. 
 
**Dowser:** Seriously? Did we drive off the road for no reason? 
 
**Calabasas:** Don&#39;t question me again or I&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re fired! 
  
[A moment of shock amongst Perseus at Calabasas&#39; sudden outburst.] 
 
**Calabasas:** I mean... apologies, that wasn&#39;t very professional of me. I recommend that you don&#39;t question my authority in the future, or ever again. 
 
**Dowser:** Fine. 
 
[Another moment of silence. Dowser finds the highway again and resumes traveling on it.] 
  
**Vladivostok:** You know, we could just turn back if things aren&#39;t working out. I&#39;m sure we could get another exploration going once this one&#39;s over- 
 
**Calabasas:** No! Do you know what&#39;ll happen if we come back empty-handed?! We&#39;ll be ridiculed! Shamed! 
 
**Vladivostok:** I-I didn&#39;t mean it like that- 
 
**Calabasas:** Then how did you mean it, Vlad?! Tell me! How //did// you mean it?! 
 
**Vladivostok:** I just- 
 
**Calabasas:** You just want to end the exploration because it&#39;ll make //me// look bad, don&#39;t you?
 
**Vladivostok:** No! I- 
 
**Calabasas:** You&#39;re jealous of me, aren&#39;t you? You&#39;ve finally stopped thinking selfishly and realized that you&#39;re an incompetent, worthless nobody who&#39;ll never be like me! Or my friend for that matter! 
 
**Vladivostok:** Stop! Please! 
 
**Calabasas:** Stop what, huh?! Tell me, Vlad! Tell me! Tell me now! 
 
[Vladivostok begins to silently weep to himself.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** I didn&#39;t mean it like that, Cal. 
 
**Calabasas:** Exactly, you don&#39;t mean anything. See? You&#39;re learning! Up next for Vladdy-boy? The ABCs! 
 
[Suddenly, Vladivostok lunges toward Calabasas before being tackled by Lancaster and Cap, who knock over two large crates, spilling their contents on the floor of the car.] 
  
**Lancaster:** Calm down, man! You&#39;re a grown-ass man! 
 
**Vladivostok:** Fuck you, Cal! Fuck you! 
 
**Cap:** Somebody grab his arm! 
 
**Wally:** Get your foot out of my mouth! 
 
**Calabasas:** See?! He&#39;s an idiot! A fool! I think the heat&#39;s getting to him! 
 
**Vladivostok:** I-I recommend you buy a gym membership to hit a real punching bag because I&#39;m not going to be yours any longer!  
 
**Wally:** He keeps moving his leg! 
  
**Lancaster:** Stop him! 
 
**Calabasas:** Keep that peasant away from me! 
 
[Dowser, despite exercising as much concentration as he can on the road ahead of them while the fight is concurring, finally turns around and helps to break up the brawl.]
 
[Because of this, Dowser is unable to see the fighter jet crashing straight toward them.]
   
[The jet itself rams into the road at an angle, engulfing the area in smoke and flames. Perseus&#39; vehicle narrowly dodges it but manages to startle Dowser. He quickly grabs the wheel and begins to lose control, swerving left and right until toppling the vehicle on its side and dragging itself on the road before slowly coming to a stop.]
  
**Vladivostok:** Ack! What the fuck just happened?!
 
**Calabasas:** Shit! Help!
 
**Dowser:** We crashed, man! We&#39;re totaled!
 
**Lancaster:** You gotta be kiddin&#39; me!
 
**Cap:** Get your foot out of my mouth!
 
**Wally:** I think I just broke something... [He looks underneath himself, finding a broken carrot that fell out of their supply rations.]
 
**Calabasas:** Wonderful! A big fucking mess and a broken car, what else could go wrong?!
 
**Wally:** You&#39;re worried about the //mess// when a fucking explosion just went off?!
 
[Suddenly, more interceptor jets fly over their now-flipped vehicle. Explosions and gunshots become more frequent than they used to be.]
 
**Lancaster:** Shit, I don&#39;t like what we just stumbled into!
 
**Calabasas:** No... nono nono... we&#39;ve got to get out of here!
 
[Bullets begin to ricochet off their bullet-proof windows.]
 
**Calabasas:** The glass is gonna break!  
 
**Lancaster:** No, it won&#39;t!
 
**Calabasas:** Yes it will you fool! We&#39;re dead! //DEAD!//]
 
**Lancaster:** Don&#39;t say that! Cappy, get our shit!
 
**Cap:** I&#39;m trying, sir! Our supplies are on the floor! I can&#39;t find anything!
 
**Dowser:** I don&#39;t know where my gun&#39;s at!
 
**Wally:** I-I have mine!
 
**Lancaster:** Damn it! Find &#39;em quicker! We&#39;re gonna get fucked real soon here if-
 
[An explosion occurs uncomfortably close to them, causing their vehicle&#39;s glass to shatter and the sounds of war to seep in all around them.]
 
**Lancaster:** [Unintelligible, other than the words &#34;grab...&#34; and &#34;protect at all costs...&#34; underneath his swearing and screaming.]
 
[Calabasas crawls on his stomach towards one of the open windows and makes a run for it on the battlefield.]
 
**Lancaster:** WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU... [Unintelligable]... SOMEONE GET HIS ASS-[Unintelligable, as a helicopter flying by muffles his voice.]
 
**Vladivostok:** [Unintelligible], he&#39;ll be dead anyway! Fuck him!
 
**Lancaster:** That ain&#39;t what I&#39;m here for, I&#39;m going out to get his ass if no one else is going to!
 
**Cap:** Wait, no! It&#39;s too dangerous! I&#39;ll- [Unintelligable].
 
**Lancaster:** Join me, we&#39;ll go and-
 
[Some kind of debris hits their vehicle, engulfing the top of it in flames and sparks.]
 
**Cap:** [Unintelligable, but sounds to be the word &#34;fire!&#34; being repeated.]
 
**Dowser:** Get out! Get out!
 
**Lancaster:** [Unintelligible].
 
[Lancaster and the three privates crawl out of the vehicle and make a run for it toward different pieces of rubble and desert basins to the left as Vladivostok runs off to the right. Bullets and explosions occur all around him, flinging sand in all directions. Lancaster and the three privates&#39; body cameras cease to function after being charred by the fire from before.]
 
**Vladivostok:** [Unintelligible, as he is out of breath yet still sprints at full force.]
  
[The sounds of an explosion clips Vladivostok&#39;s body camera audio.]
 
**Vladivostok:** [Repeating the word &#34;fuck&#34; in a rising sense of panic and terror-filled adrenaline as his voice dissolves into squeaking and croaking from his copious screaming.]
 
[A large boulder can be seen in the distance, and Vladivostok as if by instinct jumps behind it, opposite to the bullets that were whizzing past him from his left. He pants, and immediately resumes screaming the different members of Perseus&#39; names for help.]
 
**Vladivostok:** Help me! Somebody! Anybody! Anybody...
 
[He finally reaches into his pants pocket for his radio, and screams into it likewise.]
 
**Vladivostok:** Help! Help! I&#39;m pinned down! Help! Can you see me?! Can you hear me?! Hello?!
 
[Nothing but static emits from the radio.]
 
**Vladivostok:** Shit! No...
 
[He looks around himself frantically as his heart is about ready to leap out of his throat.]
 
[Then, he sees a blue blob not too far from him as the sounds of war die down.]
 
**Vladivostok:** H-huh... what?
 
[He sees a figure that appears to be Calabasas.]
 
**Vladivostok:** Cal... Cal... C-CaL!
 
[He leaves the boulder and rushes towards Calabasas at full force.]
 
**Vladivostok:** Cal! Cal! It&#39;s me! Get over here!
 
[No response.]
 
**Vladivostok:** Cal?!
 
[He finally approaches Calabasas, who is in a state of shock and visibly wounded in his stomach. He is emitting a low-pitched whine.]
 
**Calabasas:** ...Vlad?
 
[Vladivostok collapses in front of Calabasas, putting his hand on his wound as he pants his slimy breath onto him.]
 
**Vladivostok:** Cal?
 
**Calabasas:** I&#39;m hit...
 
**Vladivostok:** Don&#39;t move, man. It&#39;s gonna be alright...
 
**Calabasas:** Go, I&#39;m dead.
 
**Vladivostok:** No you&#39;re not!
 
**Calabasas:** I said //go//!
 
[He coughs up blood after his attempt at yelling.]
 
**Calabasas:** Don&#39;t worry, man. It&#39;s gonna be alright... it&#39;s gonna be alright, don&#39;t die on me...
 
[Then, multiple SCP-7799-4 instances drive up to them in a makeshift armored pickup truck. Two of them hop out of the bed of the truck and approach the exhausted Vladivostok and wounded Calabasas. Two more exit the vehicle from the passenger and driver&#39;s seat.]
 
**SCP-7799-4 Instance #1:** [Hungarian] What do we have here? [It cocks its street sweeper shotgun]
 
**SCP-7799-4 Instance #2:** [Hungarian] A couple of stragglers, no doubt.
 
**SCP-77799-4 instance #3:** [Hungarian] They look more like civilians to me. Wonder if they got any cash on &#39;em...
 
**Vladivostok:** Uh, I... hello there...
 
[Vladivostok falls backward, staring up at the armed instances pointing automatic rifles and shotguns at him.]
 
**Vladivostok:** [Hungarian] Is that Hungarian I hear?
 
[The instances look back at each other, perplexed. Then look back at Vladivostok.]
 
**SCP-7799-4 Instance #1:** You don&#39;t know Hungarian?
  
**Vladivostok:** I know Hungarian, its just that-
  
**SCP-7799-4 instance #1:** Good, now tell us who you&#39;re working for.
  
**Vladivostok:** You don&#39;t understand, my friend here is hurt! You gotta help him!
  
**SCP-7799-4 Instance #1:** Oh, your friend? Do you care about him?
 
**Vladivostok:** I mean... yes-
 
[The first instance approaches Calabasas and examines him, who now has his eyes rolled into the back of his head. He feels his pulse.]
 
**SCP-7799-4 Instance #1:** Almost a goner. I got some meds for him in the back that&#39;ll make all of //this// go away.
 
**Vladivostok:** Oh thank you! Thank you! Thank you-
 
[The first instance puts his shotgun up to Calabasas&#39; head.]
 
**SCP-7799-4 Instance #1:** It&#39;ll come at a price, though. [Chuckle.]
 
**Vladivostok:** W-what do you mean?
 
**SCP-7799-4 Instance #2:**  What he means is that he wants some... reparations. You happen to have any cash on you?
 
**SCP-7799-4 Instance #1:** Hand everything you have over and I&#39;ll save your friend here.
 
**Vladivostok:** I-I don&#39;t have any money.
 
[The instance turns its head and stares at Vladivostok with its still and emotionless happy face.]
 
**SCP-7799-4 Instance #1:** No money?
 
**Vladivostok:** No money.
 
**SCP-7799-4 Instance #1:** Then I guess I&#39;ll have to kill your friend.
 
**Vladivostok:** No! Please! I&#39;ll do anything!
 
**SCP-7799-4 Instance #2:** He&#39;s lying! That shylock&#39;s pockets are probably filled to the fucking brim with Vienna banknotes!
 
**SCP-7799-4 Instance #3:** You sure he&#39;s a shylock? He doesn&#39;t have that &#34;Ashkenazi&#34; look to him if you know what I mean.
 
**SCP-7799-4 Instance #2:** Don&#39;t matter to me, let&#39;s kill them already.
 
**Vladivostok:** No! Please! I don&#39;t wanna die! Please... I&#39;ll do anything! Anything you want!
 
[Tears run down Vladivostok&#39;s face as he beseeches to the instances.]
 
**Vladivostok:** Please! I&#39;ll do anything-
 
[Instance one pulls out his sidearm and smacks the butt of it across Vladivostok&#39;s face, causing him to drop to the ground, unresponsive.]
  
**SCP-7799-4 Instance #3:** Great, now we&#39;ll never know where the money&#39;s at.
 
**SCP-7799-4 Instance #1:** Check both of them for anything you think might be worth a nickle or two at Josef&#39;s pawn shop.
 
[The instances loot Calabasas and Vladivostok for anything noteworthy.]
 
**SCP-7799-4 Instance #1:** They don&#39;t have anything! What&#39;s with all this trash they&#39;re wearing anyway?
 
**SCP-7799-4 Instance #2:** Is that a lab coat? Did we just mug Doc Brown and his secret twin brother?
 
[The third instance pulls at Vladivostok&#39;s body camera.]
 
**SCP-7799-4 Instance #3:** Does this look like it&#39;s worth anything?
 
**SCP-7799-4 Instance #1:** Looks like a piece of plastic to me. I doubt it.
 
**SCP-7799-4 Instance #3:** So now what? Do we put them out of their misery?
 
**SCP-7799-4 I instance #1:** Hmm... I think I know how to make this worth my time. Get the potato sacks out of the glove box and some of the zip ties in the trunk.
 
**SCP-7799-4 Instance #2:** Alright then.
 
[An explosion echoes in the distance.]
 
**SCP-7799-4 Instance #1:** We should probably get out of here. This skirmish doesn&#39;t seem over yet.
 
**SCP-7799-4 Instance #3:** Good idea.
 
[Soon after, the instances place black sacks on their heads and zip-tie their hands and feet together before tossing them into the bed of the truck. They drive off in the opposite direction of the fighting.]

HQ has now entered a state of great worry regarding Perseus&#39; state. Multiple transmissions are sent to their terminal to no avail or a response. Debate ensues whether or not Perseus should be declared KIA after a set period of time. Dr. Pen remarks on the situation at HQ as &#34;an anxiety-ridden workplace full of people worried if they had failed their job&#34;.

[Both Calabasas&#39; and Vladivostok&#39;s body cameras continue to record despite previous events. Both lay unconscious in the bed of the truck for what appears to be around four hours. Calabasas&#39; camera is facing down, rendering his footage useless for the remainder of the drive. Vladivostok&#39;s camera faces directly upward towards the sky, allowing the camera to only record the sky and anything that may block it. The sky occasionally changes to different shades of the day, signifying the passing of time with clouds floating by and momentarily covering the sun causing the scene to become grey.]
 
[After four hours of unresponsiveness, the truck stops at an undisclosed location for five minutes, assumably a gas station, before driving off again upon the instance&#39;s return. After another hour of driving, the camera&#39;s view of the blue-orange sky is interrupted by filthy and unevenly placed bricks and small lights passing by in quick succession, implying they are in a freeway tunnel. Other vehicles can now be heard in the camera&#39;s recorded audio, and the sky returns once again with city buildings and apartments in view. However, this time, they are in no way similar to the Valley Of Ashes mock known as Czernowitz. This was a real city, effectively untouched by the insurgent squabbles and war-torn hellish landscape only a hundred thousand meters away. The two are unaware that they are now in SCP-7799&#39;s equivalent to Budapest.]
 
**Vladivostok:** Aww... shit. Ahhhhhh! My head... man, I... hello?
 
[Vladivostok begins to regain consciousness, but slowly begins to realize his current state, and his anxiety levels rise significantly.]
 
**Vladivostok:** Nonononono... shit...
 
[Calabasas&#39; low-pitched moaning can be heard. Vladivostok seems to hear it and moves around sporadically to the best of his ability to feel if he is there. Assumably, Vladivostok&#39;s thrashing leg feels Calabasas, confirming that he is there.]
 
**Vladivostok:** Oh... there you are... friend...
 
[Vladivostok&#39;s unusual behavior appears to be from long exposure to heat from the sun.] 
  
**Vladivostok:** My... friend... my friend... are you there? 
 
**Calabasas:** [Unintelligible gargling and spitting.]
 
**Vladivostok:** Damn it, I&#39;m so happy to see you! -I mean! //Hear you//.
 
[Calabasas lays unconscious.]
 
**Vladivostok:** I thought I was a goner... I thought //you// were a goner.
 
[Calabasas gargles.]
 
[Another thirty minutes go by of Vladivostok weakly shouting for help to no avail. The truck assumes to have not stopped at any street lights or stop signs for no one to have noticed the two by now. Vladivostok stops shouting for help and instead engages in increased unorthodox behavior.]
 
**Vladivostok:** I love you, man. I love you I love you I love you! I //love you//! So much... so much... so much... I ... If... I... I love you! Ah... dee dee dee-do-wop... lady fingers... they taste just like lady fingers-
  
[The truck finally stops with its engine ceasing. The sound of two doors being opened can be heard and the SCP-7799-4 instances are seen carrying Vladivostok and Calabasas out of the truck bed and into a building of some sort behind a taller office building.]
 
**Vladivostok:** My //best// friend... your a meanie head... but your my friend forever... 
 
**7799-4 Ints. #?:** [Hungarian] I think he&#39;s awake.
 
**7799-4 Inst. #?:** [Hungarian, in a whisper.] Get him in there faster, then!
   
[It appears that the instances have carried them into some kind of hallway with a staircase leading them down. They continue down this winding staircase until approaching two swing doors with muffled music behind them. They push the doors open to reveal an unusual scene.]
 
[It appears to be a 1980s nightclub with people drinking and dancing together. However, most of them are engaging in activities like strip teasing, sex, and gambling. More SCP-7799-4 instances are seen engaging in nightclub activities or on guard. Past the disco ball hanging from the ceiling and a crowd of assumably artificial civilians dancing on the dancefloor, multiple flags can be seen hanging on the wall of the nightclub like posters containing a yellow smiley face over a black background. Hungarian text below it reads: &#34;Rationality is best&#34;.] 
  
**Vladivostok:** Ahh... the light... the music... turn it down...
 
**7799-4 Inst. #?:** [Unintelligible, due to the music. Might have been &#34;The fuck is he saying?&#34;]
 
**7799-4 Inst. #?:** [Unintelligible, due to music. Except for the words &#34;I dunno&#34;]
 
[The instances carry Vladivostok and Calabasas into another room, this time filled with a computer desk and a soggy mattress in the corner. The instances thankfully walk past this room into a basement that leads down a wooden staircase into a cold supply room filled with boxes and crates of all kinds. Two foldable chairs sit in the middle across from each other at different angles with a yellow fluorescent light hanging above them, illuminating that specific spot like a circus performance in a circus tent.]
 
[Vladivostok and Calabasas are tied to the chairs with more zip ties as the black potato sack on their heads are ripped off, revealing two red sweaty faces.]
 
**Vladivostok:** [Coughing] I... huh... oh... its... so cool in here.. ah...
 
**7799-4 Inst. #?:** State your name, civilian.
 
**Vladivostok:** Huh? What? I... who are you?
 
**7799-4 Inst. #?:** Are you fucking stupid? Do you want to die?
  
**Vladivostok:** I... don&#39;t feel so good, Cal...
 
**7799-4 Inst. #?:** What are you saying? Your name is Cal?
 
[Vladivostok vomits on the floor in front of him, spraying some of it on the instances&#39; boots.]
 
**7799-4 Inst. #?:** Agh! What the fuck?!
 
[Once Vladivostok finishes dry-heaving, he looks up again with renewed consciousness.]
 
**Vladivostok:** Oh, shit. Yeah... I needed that... huh? Who are you?  
 
**7799-4 Inst. #?:** What the hell? Tell me your name now!
 
**Vladivostok:** I-what?! What?! Oh shit! Shit! Shit! Cal! Run for it! Run for it-
 
[The instance slaps Vladivostok&#39;s face and holds it up to his. It appears to be the first instance from before.]  
 
**7799-4 Inst. #1:** I&#39;m asking you a simple fucking question. Now tell me your fucking //name//.
 
**Vladivostok:** My... uh.. [Hungarian] My name is...
 
 **7799-4 Inst. #1:** What&#39;s your problem?! Speak up!
 
**Vladivostok:** My name is... Dowser.
 
**7799-4 Inst. #1:** ...Dowser?
 
**Vladivostok:** Yes.
 
**7799-4 Inst. #2:** Sounds like that one Super Mario Brothers villain. You know, the one on the bridge and it would throw knives at you-
 
**7799-4 Inst. #1:** Enough! Your name is Dowser, right?
 
**Vladivostok:** Yes, it is.
 
[The instance slaps Vladivostok across the face.]
 
**779-49 Inst. #1:** Nice try, but your lying! Give me the card!
 
**7799-4 Inst. #3:** Alright, boss.
 
[It pulls out something from its pocket and hands it to the first instance, who shows it to Vladivostok. It appears to be his Foundation ID card.]
 
**Vladivostok:** Oh, that isn&#39;t mine-
 
**7799-4 Inst. #1:** It says here that your name is Doctor Gergo Vladivostok, and run some kind of warehouse business. Well &#34;doctor&#34;, I guess we&#39;re gonna have a problem if you&#39;re not keen on telling the truth.
 
**Vladivostok:** It&#39;s not my card, I swear...
 
[Calabasas regains consciousness as he looks around the room. His eyes widen and his head bolts toward Vladivostok and the instances in front of him. Dribbles of blood and saliva drool down his mouth.]
 
**Calabasas:** Vlad?
 
**Vladivostok:** Cal?!
 
**7799-4 Inst #1:** Good, your awake. I thought you woulda bled out by now.
  
**Calabasas:** W-what is he saying. Vlad?! What&#39;s going on?!
 
[Calabasas looks down at his stomach, which at this point is covered in dark, dried blood with red blood being scattered near the edges of his labcoat and button-up shirt underneath.]
 
**Calabasas:** Oh shit... no... I-I need medical assistance! Anyone?! [Coughing]
 
**Vladivostok:** [English] They&#39;re on to us!
 
**Calabasas:** Shit!
 
**7799-4 Inst. #1:** You&#39;ll talk to your friend here but not us?! Bullshit! Privet, get me the hacksaw! If we can&#39;t make them talk, we&#39;ll make them squawk!
 
**Vladivostok:** [Hungarian] H-hacksaw?!
 
[The second instance hands the first a rusty, worn hacksaw. The first instance hovers over Vladivostok and Calabasas&#39; in an ominous fashion.]
   
**7799-4 Inst. #1:** I&#39;m giving you one last chance.
 
**Calabasas:** Fuck you!
 
**7799-4 Inst. #1:** What&#39;s he saying?
 
**Calabasas:** That&#39;s right! Our mouths are shut! 
 
**7799-4 Inst. #1:** [It looks to Calabasas] If you don&#39;t start speaking a language I understand then we&#39;re gonna have a problem. [It points the hacksaw at Vladivostok&#39;s face.]
 
**Calabasas:** I mean... I...
  
[The instance slaps Vladivostok with the hacksaw, making a red scratch across his face that pours little trickles of blood.]
 
**Vladivostok:** Stop it! Please! We&#39;re just civlians! That&#39;s it! We were-
 
[He is struck again with the hacksaw.]
 
**Vladivostok:** Agh! Stop it! That&#39;s it! I swear! I swear by my fucking life!
 
[He struck once more.]
 
**Calabasas:** I&#39;ll tell you! Just stop hitting him!
 
**Vladivostok:** [English] He doesn&#39;t understand you! He&#39;s speaking Hungarian!
  
**7799-4 Inst. #1:** Stop playing dumb with me! I&#39;m gonna saw off his fucking arm if you don&#39;t answer me in the Habsburg&#39;s tongue. 
 
**Calabasas:** But I-
 
**7799-4 Inst. #1:** I&#39;m done with this bullshit!
 
[The instance places the hacksaw on Vladivostok&#39;s shoulder.]
 
**7799-4 Inst. #1:** Your gonna be an amputee for the rest of your fucking life!
 
**Vladivostok:** [Hungarian] No! Please! Oh god, no!
  
[Suddenly, another instance rushes downstairs.]
 
**7799-4 Inst. #?:** Yo! There&#39;s a ton of bobbies outside! They&#39;re really pissed off and said they wanted to see the owner of the club. Wanted some &#34;new substantial financial deal&#34; or some shit... I dunno. Come on!
  
**7799-4 Inst. #1:** You&#39;re kidding me?  
 
**7799-4 Inst. #?:** Nothing but the truth.
 
[The instance puts the hacksaw down and goes upstairs with the other instance in the room.]
 
**7799-4 Inst. #1:** Stupid! We don&#39;t pay these guys twenty grand a fucking month to have them stand right outside our clubs!
 
[Once they are out of sight and shut the basement door behind them, Calabasas and Vladivostok immediately attempt to break their zip ties.]
  
**Vladivostok:** [English] I can&#39;t believe you were willing to blow the operation like that!
 
**Calabasas:** Relax, I wasn&#39;t. I was going to make some shit up that a group of simple-minded brutes like them would have believed. Trust me on that.
 
**Vladivostok:** Just try and break your zip tie, man!
  
**Calabasas:** Fine.
 
[They both strain themselves and fiddle with their fingers around the zip tie surrounding their wrist, but fail to make any progress.]
  
**Vladivostok:** Damn it! It&#39;s fucking useless!
 
**Calabasas:** Any more bright ideas, manchild? 
   
**Vladivostok:** Screw you. 
 
**Calabasas:** It&#39;s //your// fault that we&#39;re in this mess- 
 
**Vladivostok:** Stop pinning everything on me! I was just doing my job! Please! 
 
**Calabasas:** Me too, and you&#39;re trying to be a nuisance to me! 
 
**Vladivostok:** No I&#39;m not! 
 
[They continue to squirm their tied hands around.]
  
**Calabasas:** This exploration was supposed to be my career-defining moment! My opportunity to gain level five clearance and you //ruined// it! I hate you! Why do bad things always have to happen to me?! Why me?! 
 
**Vladivostok:** Cal-
 
**Calabasas:** Quiet, it&#39;s your fault we&#39;re stuck in here! If you didn&#39;t sign up for this exploration then everything would have been perfect. You destroy everything you touch! 
 
**Vladivostok:** I told you I was sorry! I just wanted to impress you so we could be friends again! 
 
**Calabasas:** And now we pay for your actions. I&#39;ll make sure you get fired if we somehow get out of here alive. 
 
**Vladivostok:** I was just tired of being your sidekick like you said. I thought we were really friends. 
 
**Calabasas:** Of course you weren&#39;t my friend! Why on earth would you think that I&#39;d //ever// be friends with //you//?! I just used you to get what I wanted, that&#39;s it! Nothing else! 
 
**Vladivostok:** R-really? 
 
**Calabasas:** Yes! How&#39;d you not get that by now? 
   
[Vladivostok appears hurt by this and slumps in his chair. He looks ready to cry again.] 
  
**Calabasas:** Seriosly? You&#39;re such a man-child. Didn&#39;t you just attack me earlier in the car? 
 
**Vladivostok:** I... apologize for that. 
 
**Calabasas:** Well, let&#39;s what HQ thinks about that if they somehow get a hold of this footage. 
 
[Vladivostok is silent. Calabasas sighs.] 
 
**Calabasas:** Are you done crying?
  
**Vladivostok:** Yeah... yeah... I am. Okay, what do we do?
 
**Calabasas:** They&#39;ll probably be back any second now, so I think it&#39;s too late.
 
**Vladivostok:** I guess you&#39;re right...
 
[Vladivostok looks around, defeated until seeing some bolt cutters on the counter ten meters away from his current position. Perhaps he could accomplish what can only be done in an action movie.]
 
**Vladivostok:** There&#39;s some bolt cutters over there, that&#39;ll be enough to cut these things. I&#39;m gonna try and get them...
 
**Calabasas:** Please, stop.
 
[Vladivostok attempts to scoot his chair towards the table by throwing his body in the general direction of the table. He heaves himself one meter from his initial position, although he is already exhausted.]
 
**Vladivostok:** Damn it, I... shit it&#39;s kinda far from here...
 
**Calabasas:** Give up.
 
**Vladivostok** Hold on...
 
[Vladivostok attempts to fling himself with great force toward his destination, causing himself to fall to the floor.]
 
**Calabasas:** Great job, jackass.
 
**Vladivostok:** Shit... I think I broke something...
 
[He turns his body around as much as he can muster to see the damage. However, this damage appears to have been done to the zip tie, breaking it in two. Vladivostok notices this and quickly movies his hands up to confirm what he is seeing. He has somehow fallen in the correct position to break the zip tie on his impact.]
  
**Vladivostok:** I... I...
 
[Calabasas looks at him with widened eyes and an expression of disbelief on his face.]
 
**Calabasas:** Oh god, you-you did it! Untie me! Untie me!  
  
[Vladivostok grabs the bolt cutters on the table and rushes over to Calabasas and raises the tool over the tie.]
 
**Calabasas:** C&#39;mon, hurry up!
 
**Vladivostok:** You promise to stop being a dick?
 
**Calabasas:** What are you talking about?
 
**Vladivostok:** Stop treating me like a dog, you promise?!
 
**Calabasas:** I don&#39;t care! Just untie me!
  
[Vladivostok cuts the zip tie and frees Calabasas. Soon after, they are rummaging through the basement for anything they deem important. Calabasas finds an old bottle of painkillers.]
 
**Vladivostok:** Are you seriously eating that?
 
**Calabasas:** Shut it. [He eats the entire bottle down without any kind of refreshment to swallow them and instead uses his teeth to grind them up.]
  
**Vladivostok:** You&#39;re gonna die, dude! What the hell are you doing?!
 
**Calabasas:** They&#39;re tiny doses, relax.
 
**Vladivostok:** Don&#39;t blame me then if you hurl them up later-
 
[The sound of gunshots followed by screaming upstairs interrupts Vladivostok.]
 
**Calabasas:** What the hell is happening up there?!
 
**Vladivostok:** I don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t wanna find out. We gotta go, now.
 
**Calabasas:** We can&#39;t just waltz out of here like nothing, we&#39;ll get fucked in an instant!
 
**Vladivostok:** Just lay low, and we&#39;ll find a backdoor or something.
 
**Calabasas:** What are we going to do when we get out? We have no idea where Lancaster and the privates are, and our ride is just a smoldering wreck on the desert highway! What do you think we&#39;re gonna do?!
 
**Vladivostok:** We&#39;ll just have to make one up! You&#39;ve made a contingency plan out of nothing before, haven&#39;t you? Just do that again.
 
**Calabasas:** Making a plan isn&#39;t as easy as making it up along the way, but given our circumstances, I think it&#39;s our only option.
 
**Vladivostok:** C&#39;mon, be careful...
   
[Vladivostok and Calabasas carefully walk their way upstairs and slowly open the door to the frantic sounds of gunshots and peril amongst the nightclub&#39;s guests. Any SCP-7799-4 instance that was present before are now seen lying on the ground deceased.]
 
**Calabasas:** Holy shit...
 
**Vladivostok:** This way!
  
[Vladivostok grabs the hand of Calabasas as if he were a damsel in distress and dives below the bullets and pandemonium to land behind a bar table, right next to the body of a dead bartender.]
 
**Calabasas:** So now what?! You just pinned us down!
 
**Vladivostok:** Uh, I-
 
[Vladivostoki looks in both directions before seeing a &#34;employees only&#34; sign less than meter away from them.]
 
**Vladivostok:** I think we just found our Dues Ex Machina. Come on.
 
[They quickly leap into the door, barely dodging a bullet traveling in their general direction, and run past various backroom shelves and food containers. After some frantic searching, they find another door with a bold &#34;Exit&#34; sign glowing above it and enter through it with no precautions. After climbing another flight of stairs, they finally reach the surface as the sun&#39;s ever-persistent glare blinds them upon their re-surfacing.]
 
**Calabasas:** Ah! Shit! My eyes!
 
**Vladivostok:** Don&#39;t stop now, we gotta find something to patch yourself up. Painkillers won&#39;t fix everything.
 
**Calabasas:** What makes you think there&#39;s any medical wards around here?
 
**Vladivostok:** I dunno, its the 80s. There&#39;s got be some pharmacies or urgent care I can take you to.
 
**Calabasas:** Phramacy? Urgent care? What am I, five years old? I got shot in the fucking stomach, Vlad! I need to get to a hospital!
 
**Vladivostok:** There&#39;ll be questions if we go to a hospital! We //have// to find a pharmacy or something like it!
 
**Calabasas:** Fine! Shit, it hurts so much! I shouldn&#39;t have run so hard!- Hey, what&#39;s going on over there?
 
**Vladivostok:** What?
 
[The two of them peer around the corner as the chaos within the nightclub finally ends, and SCP-7799-2 instances leave the club with multiple civilians and SCP-7799-4 instances in custody. They metallically and emotionlessly march their captured individuals and entities to the back of armored trucks. On the side of these trucks, a logo can be seen that contains the Vatican City&#39;s coat of arms with bold text in different languages that reads: &#34;ECT: Enforcement of Catholic Traditions&#34;. A Catholic priest prays over the detainees as they are shoved into the back of the trucks on their way to jail, and maybe prison.]
 
[Meanwhile, a beaten SCP-7799-4 instance that appears to be the same one seen before (specifically instance #1), is pulled out of the nightclub and dragged toward a military transporter. The SCP-7799-2 instances that carried it over there surround it in a menacing fashion.]
 
**SCP-7799-2 Instance #1:** [Hungarian] {{Who is the owner of this lecherous establishment, rebel scum?}}
 
**7799-4 Inst. 1?:** I don&#39;t know, man! I work here! That&#39;s it! I swear! Please spare me! Please! I&#39;ll defect if I have to!
 
**SCP-7799-2 Instance #2:** {{We are not interested in changing your military allegiance. What we want to know is the owner of this repugnant establishment.}}
  
**7799-4 Inst. #1:** I-I have their names... S-some guy named Vladivostok and another named Calabasas or something. Their IDs are in the basement! I-I can show you!
 
**SCP-7799-2 Instance #1:** {{Lead the way, rebel scum.}}
 
[The SCP-7799-2 Instances follow the defeated SCP-7799-4 instance into the nightclub.]
  
**Calabasas:** You left our fucking IDs?!
 
**Vladivostok:** I-I forgot! There was so much going on!
 
**Calabasas:** I can&#39;t belive it! You stupid, ignorant, worthless piece of shit-
  
[Calabasas begins to cough violently. Some blood droplets fall out of his mouth.]
 
**Vladivostok:** Save your shit-talking for later. I have to get you to a pharmacy.
 
[Vladivostok carries Calabasas, who has a hard time getting his legs up off the ground. He notices a white pickup truck nearby and carries Calabasas toward the truck. Vladivostok quickly looks from left to right before breaking the truck&#39;s driver seat window by running his fist into the glass. The vehicle&#39;s car alarm wails as he flails his arm around inside the car before finding the door lock and pulling it up. His knuckles are covered in scratches and blood, but he still opens the door and hops into the vehicle as if it were his own and lays Calabasas in the passenger seat next to him. They drive off into the sunset-covered street, filled with cars full of civilians that do not notice their suffering but rather live in their own world of bliss ignorance.]

**Written Report** 
 
HQ is unsure of the next course of action to take. Dr. Bimston recommends up the idea of bringing in SCP-7799-3 from Site-88 to question it regarding its insurgency in hopes of gaining an idea of what may have happened to Perseus of they were taken prisoner by SCP-7799-4 instances. Below is the following interview.

[Dr. Pen waits impatiently in the interrogation room, momentarily checking his watch. Finally, SCP-7799-3 is seen being escorted by two armed guards to the chair opposite to Pen at the interrogation desk. The two guards exit and wait outside of the room as Pen pulls out note-taking paper.]
  
**Pen:** Alright, now that you&#39;re settled in, I&#39;ll just be asking a couple of questions and be on my way. I assume those &#34;methods&#34; I told you about have convinced you to be more inclined in telling the truth, yes? 
 
[SCP-7799-3 is silent. Its large yellow head stares at Dr. Pen without making a sound of any kind.] 
 
**Pen:** [More sternly] Am I right? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** You could say that. 
 
**Pen:** Good. I have some questions about your insurgency you told me about. It was called the X-Insurgency, correct? 
  
**SCP-7799-3:** Yes. 
 
**Pen:** Okay. Now tell me, what do you do with all those people you&#39;ve captured? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Excuse me? 
 
**Pen:** What does your insurgency do to people you&#39;ve captured? Where do you take them, or &#34;dispose&#34; of them in some cases I assume? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Them?  
 
**Pen:** Yes. 
 
[SCP-7799-3 looks around the room silently. It looks back at Dr. Pen.] 
 
**Pen:** Well, I&#39;m waiting. 
  
**SCP-7799-3:** At the back. 
 
**Pen:** [His eyes widen as if surprised at the fact it gave him information for once.] W-what? Say that again? 
  
**SCP-7799-3:** If we kill them, we take them to the very back of the kingdom and place their bodies in a little.. hole of sorts that leads outside of the kingdom and into the real world. If you look there, there should a whole pile of them. 
 
**Pen:** A-are you implying that anyone who gets captured would wind up dead? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Yes, to put it frankly. I don&#39;t see any other way things could happen. 
 
[Dr. Pen writes all of this down.] 
 
**Pen:** Thank you so much! Where exactly around SCP-7799? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** From you outsider&#39;s perspective, I&#39;d say.. the exact opposite of where this place&#39;s stationed near the kingdom. 
 
[Dr. Pen writes down information given to him.] 
 
**Pen:** Thank you so much for this information! Now we&#39;ll know if they&#39;re really dead! It&#39;s very much appreciated, X. You&#39;re excused. 
 
[Dr. Pen buzzes in the guards again, who take SCP-7799-3 away as Dr. Pen leaves the office.] 
  
[However, as Dr. Pen walks down the hall, he hears SCP-7799-3 laughing as he is escorted away. Pen looks back for a moment before continuing down the hall.]

[Vladivostok has successfully taken Calabasas to a small urgent care where he was treated for his wounds with moderately helpful medication that would be substantial enough for him to walk upright again. As hoped, the urgent care in question did not ask any questions regarding the origins of Calabasas&#39; wounds and gave him a Micky Mouse band-aid for good measure.]

[Vladivostok and Calabasas continue driving through the bustling streets of Budapest where city lights shine bright, untouched by the war east of the city. SCP-7799-2 instances patrol the city as police officers, keeping close surveillance of artificial civilians who either engage in the activities of the 80s or are currently at work.] 
 
**Calabasas:** Why are we slowing down? There&#39;s nothing to see than Ghostbusters which seems to be in theatres right now. [He points to a nearby movie theatre with its sign reading &#34;Now showing: Ghostbusters&#34;]
 
**Vladivostok:** We&#39;re not here to see a movie. I&#39;m looking for Phil and the privates. 
 
**Calabasas:** I&#39;ve told you, they&#39;re dead. They must be. 
 
**Vladivostok:** Well, I still have hope- 
 
**Calabasas:** This isn&#39;t a fucking Disney movie, Vlad! We&#39;re not going to find them! They&#39;re dead! Need me to spell it out for you?! D-E-A-D: Dead! 
   
**Vladivostok:** [Sigh] You&#39;re probably right. It&#39;s my fault, isn&#39;t it? 
 
**Calabasas:** It most certainly is. 
 
**Vladivostok:** Could you at least keep your eyes peeled in case we find them? We weren&#39;t too far from Budapest when we got attacked, so maybe they got here too. 
  
**Calabasas:** Maybe. But what are the odds of finding them in a city like this? They could be anywhere. 
 
**Vladivostok:** Phil&#39;s a distinctive man, isn&#39;t he? I think it&#39;s possible. 
 
**Calabasas:** I doubt it. 
   
**Vladivostok:** Where&#39;s the first place you&#39;d go to if you got stranded and you came across a city? 
 
**Calabasas:** Good question.. maybe a store? Police station? Park? Post office? I don&#39;t know, somewhere that could tell me where I am. 
 
**Vladivostok:** Then let&#39;s check those places! 
 
**Calabasas:** We&#39;re not tourists! We need to get out of this city and finish the exploration! Who knows how much storage these cameras have left?!
 
**Vladivostok:** Are you crazy?! We&#39;re getting out of here! 
 
**Calabasas:** But... my record will-
 
**Vladivostok:** That doesn&#39;t matter, we need to find Phil and those privates then we get out of here, whether you like it or not. 
 
**Calabasas:** We&#39;ll see about that.
 
[Vladivostok picks up speed and turns left, leaving a town square and driving down a pedestrian-filled street teeming with cars and artificial civlians making their way through them to their destination. Vladivostok nearly hits a multitude of civlians on his way out of there, with some throwing vulgar gestures at him due to his subpar driving skills. It is reminiscent of 1980s New York City.] 
 
[Upon turning right into an apartment-centric section of the city, a rabble of civilians can be seen waving flags and holding signs, standing in the way of the road. They appear upset about something.] 
 
**Calabasa:** What&#39;s their problem?
 
**Vladivostok:** I have no idea. Probably what was causing all that traffic back there. 

**Calabasas:** Seems so, but how are we going to get past them? 
 
**Vladivostok:** Hold on. 
 
[Vladivostok drives up close to the crowd and honks his horn while barely nudging his vehicle forward to get the message across that he wishes to pass, but the rabble does not take notice nor respond.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** [He rolls down his window] Hey! We&#39;re driving here, move! 
 
**Calabasas:** I thought they only spoke Austro-Hungarian. 
   
**Vladivostok:** There&#39;s no such thing as an &#34;Austro-Hungarian&#34; language, Cal. They probably speak Austrian German or Hungarian. Hell, maybe some other Eastern or Southern European language-
 
**???:** [Hungarian] Are you willing to join the fight against the hippies?! 
 
[Vladivostok and Calabasas are startled by this strange man&#39;s sudden outburst at their opened window.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** [Hungarian] E-excuse me? 
 
**???:** The fight against the hippies! They&#39;re trying to get the X-Insurgency to turn us all to Sodomy! But we won&#39;t be fooled by them! We&#39;ll //kill// them if we have to. 
 
**Vladivostok:** What are you talking about? 
 
**???:** Have you been living under a rock? There&#39;s X-Insurgents hiding //everywhere// in the shadows, just out of sight! They&#39;re trying to give the hippies power in our modern society and convert us to homosexuality and feminism! We&#39;re standing up against those happy-faced freaks and hippies that follow them! 
 
**Vladivostok:** W-what? What are you on about?
  
**??? #2:** -But don&#39;t worry, Hungarian brother! Tonight we will bring these tyrants to justice! Kaiser Constantine told us to do so on TV today! 
 
[Vladivostok recognizes the name.]
 
**Vladivostok:** Kaiser Constantine? It-I mean, he told you to do this? 
 
**??? #2:** Yes! We will stand out here all night if we have to! Glory to Austria and Hungary! 
   
[The crowd cheers and waves their Austro-Hungarian banners above them. Vladivostok drives back to the main street with Calabasas, both feeling somewhat disgusted at what they saw.] 
   
**Calabasas:*** What were they raving about? 
 
**Vladivostok:** From what I can tell it&#39;s a protest. What they&#39;re protesting against exactly was confusing to me but had something to do about the X-Insurgency. That man told me they were &#34;everywhere&#34;. 
 
**Calabasas:** And what else? 
 
**Vladivostok:** They said that &#34;Kaiser Constantine&#34; told them to do it. SCP-7799-1, remember that thing? 
 
**Calabasas:** Looks like everybody&#39;s just a puppet with its hand up their ass. But the politics of this place doesn&#39;t matter to me. Did you get some good shots of them? 
 
**Vladivostok:** I think our recorders got enough. 
  
**Calabasas:** Good. Also glad to hear that they hate those SCP-7799-4 instances just as much as we do. You think they&#39;ll find anything out there? 
 
**Vladivostok:** The only thing they&#39;ll find out is that their asses&#39;ll be frozen. 
  
[The two share a laugh. Calabasas appears to notice that he laughed at Vladibostok&#39;s joke, and immediately attempts to retract himself.] 
 
**Calabasas:** That doesn&#39;t matter, Vlad. We need to finish this exploration. 
 
**Vladivostok:** I told you, we&#39;re going to find Phil and the privates then get the fuck out of here. 
  
**Calabasas:** I won&#39;t be seeing you ruin my permanent record with your jealousy! I told you this! 
 
**Vladivostok:** That&#39;s not what- 
 
**Calabasas:** I&#39;m still the leader of this sorry excuse for a team called &#34;Perseus&#34; and I intend on salvaging this to the end like the great, brave man of science that I am and become an Overseer member! 
 
**Vladivostok:** So is this what all of this is about? Making you look cool? 
 
**Calabasas:** N-no! It&#39;s about proving myself to the council that I am worthy of their privileges, unlike you who can&#39;t do anything right and only serve as a thorn in my side! In /all// of our sides as a matter of fact! 
  
**Vladivostok:** I&#39;ll show you a thorn in your fucking side alright- 
 
[Vladivostok attempts to grab Calabasas before noticing his change in gaze away from himself to somewhere else on the road. Calabasas has an expression of surprise and disbelief as his gaze fixates on a tall man and three shorter men fleeing out of a liquor store with stuffed plastic bags that have the bright Seven-Eleven Logo on them. Vladivostok looks at these men likewise and recognizes them. There is a moment of silence.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** Phil? [He says it with uncertainty, as if ready to retract it at any moment.]
  
**Calabasas:** What... is he doing- 
 
**Vladivostok:** Phil... Phil- PHIL! Holy crap! Phil! 
 
[Vladivostok rolls down his window and leans out of it to shout. Nearby civilians look puzzled at his exclamation.] 
    
**VladivostoK:** Phil! Over here! Phil! 
 
[Lancaster turns around as if recognizing his voice, and looks at the two in similar disbelief to Calabasas&#39; earlier. The three shorter men next to him stop and look in Lancaster&#39;s general direction similarly. It is the three privates with their sergeant.] 
  
**Lancaster:** Vlad? 
 
**Vladivostok:** Phil! 
 
**Calabasas:** It&#39;s us! 
 
**Lancaster:** We&#39;ve found them! C&#39;mon. 
 
[Lancaster and the privates rush towards Vladivostok&#39;s vehicle, with one of the privates dropping their plastic bags but not seeming to care. They hop in the back of the pickup truck or lunge through the rolled-down window and crawl into the torn, dry back seat. Unaware of the fact that it is not their Range Rover from before.] 
  
[Before any welcoming session can begin, sirens behind them fill the streets as two patrol cars head straight toward them.] 
  
**Vladivostok:** Phil! I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s you- 
 
**Lancaster:** //DRIVE!// 
 
[As if it were instinct, Vladivostok slams his foot down on the accelerator and drives at around eighty kilometers an hour down the brightly colored streets of SCP-7799&#39;s Budapest.] 
 
**Lancaster:** [Unintelligible]
 
**Cap:** [Unintelligible] 
 
[Vladivostok is unable to hear Lancaster or Cap in the truck&#39;s back due to their high speed.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** I don&#39;t know where to go! 
 
**Calabasas:** What?!
 
**Vladivostok:** I said I don&#39;t know where to go! 
 
**Calabasas:** I can&#39;t hear you! 
 
[A patrol car catches up to them and gets close to the truck&#39;s blind spot, and attempts to lightly tap it in hopes of spinning their vehicle off the road. Lancaster notices this and opens fire on the patrol car&#39;s driver, which on closer inspection are SCP-7799-2 instances as signified by their large camera heads.] 
 
[The driver&#39;s head falls on the steering wheel as the glass window in front of them is shattered with splats of blood and oil. The vehicle leans right and crashes into a telephone pole as the second patrol car catches up.] 
  
**Lancaster:** One down! 
 
**Vladivostok:** What is he doing?! Now they&#39;ll open fire on us! 
 
**Calabasas:** What did you say?! 
  
[The SCP-7799-2 instance driving the second patrol car shoots through his windshield at Lancaster and Cap, who are currently laying flat in the trunk of the truck to avoid the bullets. The SCP-7799-2 instance&#39;s cracked windshield appears to obscure its view, forcing it to move up and drive side-to-side with the truck itself.]
 
[Vladivostok looks to his left and barely sees the instance through the slightly tinted windows reload its pistol and raise it up, pointing it straight toward him. Private Wally in the backseat does not notice this, but Calabasas appears to.]
 
**Calabasas:** Vlad! Look out! 
 
**Vladivostok:** No! 
 
[Then Vladivostok, as if using the last bit of courage left in his life, bolts the steering wheel to his left as his body leans in the same direction with his eyes shut tight.] 
 
**Calabasas:** What the fuck are you doing?!- 
 
[The truck hits the instance&#39;s patrol car and does not stop pushing into it. The instance&#39;s aiming position is interrupted and within seconds, both their vehicles slide down the sloped hill next to them that leads into a large pile of dry and dead shrubbery. Lancaster and Cap in the truck&#39;s bed hold on to a metal rod protruding in front of them to stop themselves from falling out.] 
 
[Both vehicles are now tumbling down the side of the hill and finally land in the dead bushes below as the camera&#39;s audio is clipped by the sound of metal crashing and the dry bushes scraping off the truck. Lancaster and the two privates with him are still in the truck as hoped, but are severely scratched and hurt from the impact.]
 
[Vladivostok and Calabasas are entangled in the car&#39;s dashboard with two empty airbags around them like scarfs. Calabasas groans as the instance&#39;s vehicle nearby continuously blasts its horn, signifying its incapacitation. Wally in the backseat was saved from the fall due to the back of Calabasas&#39; and Vladivostok&#39;s chairs.] 
  
**Calabasas:** Son of a bitch...
 
[Vladivostok slowly regains consciousness after momentarily blacking out.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** Aagh! Damn it.. are we dead? 
 
**Calabasas:** Not me, but I think Phil is. 
 
**Vladivostok:** No... shit. 
   
**Calabasas:** I think I just ran my head through the windshield... 
 
**Vladivostok:** My hand might be fucked... 
 
**Wally:** Are you guys okay?! Anybody bleeding?! 
 
**Vladivostok:** Wally, is that you? Fuck, I thought you were dead or something. 
 
**Wally:** I&#39;m not, but I think Phil and the others are dead. I doubt they survived that fall. 
 
**Calabasas:** I could count the seconds we were in mid-air, of course they&#39;re dead! 
 
**Vladivostok:** Don&#39;t say that! Somebody go check on them! 
 
**Calabasas:** How are we gonna get out of here? 
 
**Vladivostok:** Hold on.
 
[Vladivostok crawls out of the open window to his left while Calabasas kicks the windshield and shatters it to create another exit that he and Wally use. Vladivostok goes around to check on Lancaster and the two other privates while regaining his strength to walk again.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** Phil! You alright?! 
 
**Lancaster:** Shit... my fucking hands...
 
**Vladivostok:** You&#39;re alive!
 
**Lancaster:* Of course I ain&#39;t dead! I won&#39;t go out that easy... not in this place, at least. 
  
**Cap:** Is it over? Is he dead? 
  
**Vladivostok:** Cappy!
 
[Vladivostok rushes toward Lancaster and Cap to help them up.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** We thought you were goners! 
 
**Lancaster:** We were thinking the same thing till you guys showed up. 
 
**Calabasas:** Enough with this unless reunion celebration and let&#39;s keep going! 
 
**Lancaster:** Keep going?! We just found you guys again and almost died, and you want to continue the fucking mission?! 
 
**Vladivostok:** That&#39;s what I said!
 
**Dowser:** We&#39;re not doing that. 
 
**Cap:** I say we just leave. This whole exploration has gone to shit. It&#39;s not like we can keep documenting anything, either. We lost half our cameras and the rest of the drones we were supposed to plant around this territory are gone now, so it&#39;s not like we have a purpose here anymore- 
 
**Calabasas:** No! You-you all just want to ruin my reputation because y-your jealous! You&#39;re all just jealous of me because you&#39;re failures! You-you... 
 
[Calabasas appears to become emotional and walks away to vent to himself.]
 
**Lancaster:** That&#39;s a good point there, maggot. I&#39;d say that&#39;s the nail in the coffin for this exploration. All in favor? 
 
[Vladivostok, Cap, Dowser, Wally, and Lancaster raise their hands.]
  
**Lancaster:** All who oppose? 
 
[He gestures to Calabasas, who ignores him.] 
  
**Lancaster:** That means we&#39;re getting out of here. C&#39;mon, Cal. 
 
[Calabasas ignores him, but returns to the group and refrains from speaking at all.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** I don&#39;t know if that instance is dead or not, so let&#39;s just get out of here. 
 
**Lancaster:** Good idea. Don&#39;t forget our snacks, though. 
 
**Vladivostok:** We won&#39;t. By the way, why //did// you steal these snacks? 
  
**Lancaster:** We hadn&#39;t had food for over ten hours. We got desperate. I know it&#39;s not professional but... 
 
**Vladivostok:** Its alright. We do what we have to do. 
 
[Perseus pick their snacks back up and walk up the hill back onto the highway and hope to travel by thumb to the edge of the territory. One car stops for them and agrees to take them closer to the border, but will only take them to the nearest major city, Vienna, and drop them off there due to the fact that travel to the border is illegal in SCP-7799. Perseus begrudgingly agree and allow this artificial civilian to take them to Vienna in exchange for a Kit Kat bar that is in one of their stuffed bags of gas station snacks.]

**Written Report** 
 
HQ has sent multiple Task Force squadrons to the area of SCP-7799&#39;s outside border that SCP-7799-3 explained to Dr. Pen was a dumping ground for victims of SCP-7799-4 instances. After several hours of searching, the following conversation takes place.

[Dr. Pen is currently writing emails on his computer as Dr. Bimston walks into his office.] 
 
**Bimston:** I just got several messages from our Task Force squads on the other side of SCP-7799. 
  
**Pen:** You have? Ah! Now tell me, did they find those bodies? 
 
**Bimston:** Well, erm... 
  
**Pen:** Is Perseus amongst them? 
 
**Bimston:** You see, uh... 
 
**Pen:** Is Perseus&#39; status finally known? 
 
**Bimston:** ...the problem is that they haven&#39;t found anything out there. 
 
[Dr. Pen&#39;s eyes widen.]
 
**Pen:** What do you mean?
  
**Bimston:** To be frank with you, there&#39;s nothing out there. They&#39;ve been looking around the border for around a few hours now and there&#39;s no body dump or anything like it. 
 
**Pen:** How could that be? SCP-7799-3 said it itself! 
 
**Bimston:** That&#39;s another thing... you see, we&#39;ve come to believe that it lied to us. 
 
**Pen:** But it told me so! It told me that to //my face//! Site-88 waterboarded it for God knows how long to start making it tell the truth and it //lied// to us again?! 
 
**Bimston:** Unfortunately, that seems to be the case. 
 
**Pen:** But why? It has no reason to lie! [Sigh] You know what? Tell Site-88 to waterboard it //more// then! If it&#39;s going to keep lying to us, then we&#39;ll make sure it doesn&#39;t happen anymore! 
 
**Bimston:** The Ethics Committee won&#39;t let us get away with that a second time. They were already begrudgingly fine with when it was happening, now you want to try it again? 
 
**Pen:** Damn it, you&#39;re right. What are we going to do?  
 
**Bimston:** We could wait a little longer for Perseus. Maybe two weeks, and see if they come back. If not, we can assume they&#39;re dead. 
 
**Pen:** Sounds plausible, but me and the rest of this Site&#39;s higher-ups aren&#39;t very keen on waiting any longer. Or the rest of the Foundation for that matter. 
 
**Bimston:** I&#39;m aware. Just give it a little more time then we&#39;ll think of something else. 
 
**Pen:** [Sigh] All of this for nothing...

[[div class=&#34;addendum&#34;]]  
 
[BEGIN LOG]
 
[Perseus, after gaining a hitchhike that will take them closer to SCP-7799&#39;s border, are dropped off outside of Vienna, giving them a view of the massive city.]
 
**???:** [Croatian] Where&#39;s the fucking Kit Kat? 
 
**Vladivostok:** He says he wants the Kit Kat, Cap. 
 
[Private Cap pulls out a half-melted Kit Kat bar out of his bag of snacks and hands it to the driver. The driver inspects it before speaking again.] 
  
**???:** A bit melted, but nothing a little freezer time won&#39;t fix. Thank you for doing business. 
   
**Vladivostok:** [Croatian] Thank you so much. We thought we were gonna get shanked on the highway by some mugger. 
 
**???:** Who says I wasn&#39;t planning on shanking you? 
 
[The man laughs as Perseus force themselves to laugh awkwardly, unsure if the man&#39;s statement was a joke.] 
  
[The man drives away as Perseus make their way to Vienna through a drainage system that leads into the city to avoid the military outposts consisting of heavily armed SCP-7799-2 instances that surround it.] 
 
**Calabasas:** These shoes are ruined now. 
 
**Vladivostok:** So are mine and everything I&#39;m wearing. 
 
**Lancaster:** Man, I stink like a skunk in a field of rotten eggs. If we get out here alive, my first instinct is to take a shower. 
  
**Vladivostok:** Let&#39;s not worry about showers right now, but the situation at hand- 
 
[Vladivostok is interrupted by the sudden flood of sunlight around them as they approach the end of the drainage pipe. Upon exiting and allowing their eyes to get used to the sun, they see a vast 1980s city stretching across the landscape.] 
 
[The city appears identical to the real-world equivalent of the Austrian city Vienna, but styled in 1980s and Vaporwave motifs as tall office buildings and fast food joints stand tall in the center. A megamall can be seen in the distance surrounded by palm trees, and to the left, the Schönbrunn Palace stands surrounded by wealthy neighborhoods and military checkpoints, assumably SCP-7799-1&#39;s residence.]
 
[In Perseus&#39; footage, the lense notably changes to a more yellow-orange colored haze, evocative of camera systems during that time period. Perseus also appear to experience this anomalous effect in their eyes.] 
  
**Vladivostok:** Holy crap... it&#39;s bigger than I thought it would be. 
 
**Calabasas:** Why does everything look so... familiar? Warm? Comfortable?
 
**Vladivostok:** Now that you mention it, I kind of see it too...
 
**Calabasas:** It feels like I&#39;m a kid again... damn it... it&#39;s my childhood... 
 
**Vladivostok:**  I never lived during this time period, but maybe... I would like to... Wait! What am I doing? This doesn&#39;t feel natural.
 
**Calabasas:** What are you talking about? 
 
**Vladivostok:** It&#39;s probably an anomalous effect to make us feel comfortable here. It&#39;s trying to nostalgia-bait us! 
 
**Calabasas:** Seriously? 
 
**Lancaster:** How the hell are we going to get through this damn city to the other side of it? Tell me why we didn&#39;t just //walk around it// to begin with! 
 
**Vladivostok:** There were military checkpoints around the whole place when we got here. I doubt they would just let us walk straight into it for no reason. 
  
**Lancaster:** If we could take &#39;em on before, we can do it again! 
 
**Calabasas:** Calm down, Phil. All we have to do is go through like we live here and leave! 
 
**Lancaster:** How are we gonna leave? 
 
**Vladivostok:** Same way we entered, through another drainage pipe. This one we walked through ends here, so we can&#39;t stay in it forever. 
 
**Lancaster:** How do we know there&#39;s another one on the other side of the city? 
 
**Vladivostok:** That guy we gave the Kit Kat bar to told me about one. 
  
**Lancaster:** How do we know if he&#39;s lying or not? 
 
**Calabasas:** We&#39;re going to have to take a risk. It&#39;s either that or die in here. 
 
**Lancaster:** Fine, then. 
  
[Perseus embark toward the city. Before getting on any road, they steal  another artificial civilian&#39;s vehicle in a resident&#39;s front yard and drive through the heart of the city, where traffic is copious.]
  
**Vladivostok:** Damn it! What could possibly be going on?! 
 
**Calabasas:** We&#39;re going to be stuck here forever. 
 
**Vladivostok:** I&#39;ll run a red light if I can. 
 
**Lancaster:** No! Don&#39;t! We don&#39;t need any more cops on our tail! 
 
**Vladivostok:** Keep your voice down, we&#39;re trying to be low-key here, man. 
 
**Lancaster:** Shit, my bad. 
 
[Perseus slowly trudge through traffic as artificial civilians honk and curse at them due to their irregular driving.] 
 
**Lancaster:** Fuck you too! 
 
**Vladivostok:** Philip, I told you to stop it. 
 
**Lancaster:** Sorry about that, I just can&#39;t stand being flipped off! 
 
[Perseus, just as they get close to an open road, are forced to go left due to a sudden influx of more cars coming from the right of them.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** Argh! Damn it all! We&#39;re fucking trapped! 
 
**Calabasas:** What could possibly be happening?! 
 
[Nearby parade music begins to emit as the road in front of them serves as a parade path for it.]
 
**Vladivostok:** There&#39;s a fucking parade going on?!
 
**Lancaster:** That ain&#39;t no normal parade. 
  
[This parade in particular contains numerous SCP-7799-2 instances and large military vehicles with Austro-Hungarian flags. This appears to be a military parade.] 
  
**Calabasas:** Seems like the parade planners are shit at their job if they didn&#39;t have a planned path. 
 
[Armed SCP-7799-2 instances herd civlians and their vehicles out of the area to let the parade pass due to a parade route error, and Perseus blends in by moving out of the way as well. The Austro-Hungarian anthem &#34;God Serve, God Protect&#34; plays loudly as it passes by.] 
   
**Lancaster:** My ears damn it! 
   
**Calabasas:** Traffic&#39;s picking up again. 
 
**Vladivostok:** Looks like we&#39;ll have to follow it for a while until it dies out.] 
 
[Perseus is forced to follow the flow of traffic that follows the parade to allow it to reach its destination, which is in the general direction of the Schönbrunn Palace.]
 
**Calabasas:** We&#39;re never going to get out of here, are we? 
   
**Vladivostok:** Don&#39;t think like that, we&#39;ll figure something out. I&#39;m sure that we could... 
 
[In the corner of Vladivostok&#39;s eyes, he notices two SCP-7799-2 instances standing on the sidewalk in deep conversation with each other. One of them looks directly at Vladivostok, and points at him before traffic speed picks up again and Perseus&#39; vehicle leaves the area.] 
  
[Vladivostok is unsure if they were looking at him on purpose or without them knowing.] 
 
[After an hour of slow traffic and momentary moments of picking up speed then slowing down again, the Schönbrunn Palace is in view. Hundreds of artificial civilians surround it, forming a crowd similar in size to a large concert of some sort.]
 
**Wally:** What&#39;s going on? Some kind of concert? 
 
**Cap:** A party? 
 
**Vladivostok:** I&#39;m not sure. Doesn&#39;t look like they&#39;re mad about something like we saw in Budapest, right Cal? 
 
[Upon closer inspection, the crowd appears to be waving a variety of flags ranging from the Austrian, Hungarian, and different pan-Slavic flags along with many others. Music is playing through loudspeakers on top of a long stage leading towards a large stage curtain decorated in the Austro-Hungarian coat of arms. Above it, a massive cult-of personality portrait of SCP-7799-1 hangs over everything.]
 
**Calabasas:** What the hell is going to happen? 
 
**Vladivostok:** No idea. Let&#39;s stay focused, guys. 
 
[Suddenly, the music stops and the flag curtain begins to part as the crowd goes berserk.]
 
**Vladivostok:** What the hell? 
 
**Calabasas:** Hold on- 

[The stage loudspeakers begin to play &#34;Into the Groove&#34; by the musical artist &#34;Madonna&#34; as SCP-7799-1 comes into view via a rising platform out of the ground. The crowd&#39;s cheer picks up again as he is showered with roses and flashes of cameras. Confetti and fireworks go off as additional SCP-7799-2 instances serve as riot control around the stage to keep the excited artificial civilians at bay.] 
  
[SCP-7799-1&#39;s large eyeball head watches over the crowd as it walks down the stage to the front, where a golden microphone stand waits for it. It does a quick dance and a cartwheel to the microphone, further arousing the crowd. An SCP-7799-2 instance quickly approaches SCP-7799-1 and gives it an engraved pistol. SCP-7799-1 aims from under his legs and shoots a large balloon containing more balloons, releasing them into the sky. Afterward, it spins around and &#34;jazz hands&#34; the audience before finally picking up the microphone and holding it by the stand like a singer. An SCP-7799-2 instance quickly picks up his discarded pistol before exiting out of view.] 
  
**Calabasas:** I-is that- 
 
**Vladivostok:** I think it is.
 
**Calabasas:** We need to get a better look at it!
 
**Vladivostok:** No, we need to keep driving!
  
**Calabasas:** This is the closest we&#39;ve ever been to this thing and you want to //leave//? 
 
**Lancaster:** He&#39;s right. If we&#39;re coming back mostly empty-handed, we might as well get some good footage along the way. Your body cameras still work right? Mine and the maggots&#39; are broken, but I think we could still salvage the film when we escape. 
 
**Calabasass:** They do in fact, right Vlad? 
   
**Vladivostok:** [Sigh] Fine. Sure. Whatever. 
 
[Vladivostok pulls over and Perseus quickly run toward the crowd.] 
 
**Calabasas:** There&#39;s no way we&#39;re getting past that crowd to the front! 
 
**Vladivostok:** You know what, hold me up, Cal! 
 
**Calabasas:** What?! 
 
**Vladivostok:** Let me stand on your shoulders and you hold me up so I can get a good view of SCP-7799-1! 
 
**Calabasas:** Are you kidding me?! You&#39;re a grown-ass man! 
 
**Vladivostok:** C&#39;mon! You said you wanted good footage! We&#39;re getting it. 
 
[Calabasas thinks about it for a second then groans. He gets ready to lift up Vlad on his shoulders.] 
 
**Calabasas:** Tell anyone about this and you&#39;ll regret it. 
 
[Calabasas holds Vladivostok on his shoulders, giving him and his camera a better view of SCP-7799-1.]
  
**SCP-7799-1:** [Austrian German] Thank you, thank you all... you&#39;re too kind... 
 
**Calabasas:** You know what he&#39;s saying? 
 
**Vladivostok:** Yeah, be quiet. 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Oh, you all spin me right round, that&#39;s for sure. I&#39;m very happy to be here, seeing the faces of my beautiful people! That includes my Austrian brethren, the Hungarians to the east, the Germans, the Slovenians, the Slovakians, the Czechs, Ukrainians, Serbs, Italians, Poles, the Ruthenians from the Carpathian mountains, Croats, Ladins, Bosnians, and Herzegovinians!
  
[The crowd cheers for a while before quieting down. The music from the loudspeakers stops.] 
 
**SCP-7799-1:**  On a more serious note, however...  before I begin this address to the nation... I would like to once again warn you of finding yourself converted in the ways of hippies or those smiley-faced atrocities known as the &#34;X-Insurgency&#34;, who every day do everything in their power to make us into Sodomites! But they will not succeed, as me and my trustworthy men of war will protect you from the outside world and the insurgency! 
 
[There is murmuring amongst the crowd.] 
  
**SCP-7799-1:** The values of those in the outside world may change and drive themselves to Hell, but we will never be fooled by them! The X-Insurgency may try and attack us and our churches, but they will never take us! We will see ourselves victorious over their dead and rotting carcasses as their spirits are sucked into Hell to burn eternally. 
 
[The crowd cheers.] 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** I want every one of you to remain strong in your faith in God as we enter this dangerous time in which the outside world will attempt to erase us because of our faith in The Creator. There is nothing to fear, nothing to hide. We are proud Austrian and Hungarian citizens who will never give up in the face of evil. The X-Insurgency and the outside world will pay one day as we send them to Hell just as God wants. 
 
[The crowd cheers.] 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** So as I finish this small speech of mine to all of you standing in front of me and those who are watching at home, I remind you to be aware of your surroundings! Report any hippy-ism or Sodomy to your nearest officer of the law and we&#39;ll take care of them. Kids, don&#39;t eat any candy you find on the ground, because it may contain razor blades or poison put there by the X-Insurgents. Parents, watch over your kids in these dangerous times! Don&#39;t let them go astray and instead teach them the ten commandments, no matter what. Don&#39;t stop believing!
 
[The crowd cheers as SCP-7799-1 drops the microphone and gambols back into the stage curtain, out of sight. The music resumes and civlians scatter to watch the rest of the military parade as a jet fly-over takes place above them consisting of Soviet-made Mikoyen jets and attack helicopters filling the skies in a display of power.] 
 
[Vladivostok asks Calabasas to put him down.] 
  
**Calabasas:** The speech is already over? 
 
**Vladivostok:** Seems like it.
 
**Calabasas:** What did it say? 
 
**Vladivostok:** It talked about being safe and how it loves its people or something. I didn&#39;t really understand the point of the speech, though. 
  
**Calabasas:** Well, that doesn&#39;t matter right now anyway. You got footage of it, right?
 
**Vladivostok:** Yeah, I recorded the whole speech and some bits of it before it started. 
 
**Calabasas:** Good, now come on. The edge of the territory can&#39;t be too far from here, right? 
 
**Vladivostok:** It&#39;s going to be a while before we reach the border. We still have around... //300,000// meters of driving I think? 
 
**Calabasas:** [Sigh] Then we better get back on the road. We can&#39;t afford to spend any more time here, come on everybody. 
 
[Perseus walk back to their parked vehicle. As they return, however, Vladivostok notices a group of SCP-7799-2 instances pushing through groups of artificial civilians until spotting Perseus.]
 
[One of the instances looks down at a stack of wanted posters in its hands, then looks back up at Perseus.] 
  
**7799-2 Inst. #?:** {{It&#39;s them, the wanted individuals.}} [It points at Perseus, who has now noticed the group of SCP-7799-2 instances.] {{There&#39;s the delinquents that robbed the Seven Eleven and the club/warehouse owners. Engage immediately.}}
 
[The instances run at Perseus, who quickly enter their vehicle.] 
 
**Calabasas:** Drive! Drive! 
 
**Vladivostok:** I&#39;m trying! Hold on! 
 
[Vladivostok pulls off another hotwire on the vehicle and drives off, leaving the persuing instances in the dust.] 
 
**Calabasas:** Did we lose them? 
 
**Vladivostok:** I don&#39;t know, let&#39;s keep going. 
 
**Lancaster:** Look! 
 
[Three patrol cars driven by SCP-7799-2 instances follow Perseus at high speeds down the road. Perseus narrowly avoids other vehicles on the road and in some cases, pedestrians.] 
 
**Calabasas:** It&#39;s last night all over again! We&#39;re gonna crash! 
 
**Vladivostok:** Damn it, you&#39;re right! I&#39;m slowing down a bit.
 
[Vladivostok slows the vehicle down and takes a sharp right down a different road, driving at similar speeds to the artificial civlians driving around them. The patrol cars follow and slow down likewise, getting close to Perseus&#39; vehicle.] 
  
**Lancaster:** They&#39;re aiming! Take cover!  
 
[Lancaster and the privates in the backseat duck as bullets shatter the rear windows of the vehicle, spilling glass all over them.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** Shit! 
 
**Calabasas:** They&#39;re shooting, man! They&#39;re shooting! 
 
[Vladivostok in a panic drives into a megamall&#39;s parking lot as the patrol cars follow, continuing to fire on the vehicle, leaving bullet holes on the back of it and shattering glass.] 
  
**Cap:** I don&#39;t wanna die, man! Please! 
  
**Lancaster:** Can you give us some covering fire... [Unintelligible] 
    
**Calabasas:** Why me?! Why now?! 
 
**Wally:** Do something! 
 
**Vladivostok:** I don&#39;t know where to go! 
  
[Vladivostok continues to drive down the parking lot before seeing the mall&#39;s sliding glass door entrance.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** Brace yourselves! 
 
**Calabasas:** What?! What did you say-
 
[Calabasas is interrupted, as Vladivostok rams through the mall&#39;s entrance into its interior, driving down the marble floor and past escalators filled with horrified spectators. The mall&#39;s Vaporwave lounge music can be heard.] 
   
**Calabasas:** What are you doing?! 
 
**Vladivostok:** There was nowhere to go! 
 
[Unexpectedly, the patrol cars follow suit inside and drive just as recklessly as Perseus without any regard for the safety of artificial civilians.] 
    
**Lancaster:** They&#39;re still back there! Lose &#39;em! 
 
[Vladivostok takes a hard left down the mall, running over plants, stands, and benches, causing the front of the vehicle to sustain heavy damage. The patrol cars follow behind them.] 
 
**Calabasas:** Left! 
 
**Lancaster:** No, right! Go right! 
  
**Calabasas:** No, left! 
 
**Lancaster:** Right-I mean, left! 
 
**Calabasas:** Right! Right! 
 
**Dowser:** Dead end! 
 
**Vladivostok:** Agh! 
 
[Vladivostok notices the wall ahead of them, and in a lucky guess, he steers right and drives into a toy store.] 
 
**Dowser:** What the hell?! Are you trying to hit kids now?! 
 
**Vladivostok:** I didn&#39;t mean to go here! 
  
[Vladivostok randomly steers left and right in an attempt to avoid striking any children with his vehicle, crashing into aisles and shelves that send G.I. Joe and Transformer action figures through the windshield into their faces.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** Fuck, my eye! 
 
**Lancaster:** What the hell, man?! 
 
**Cap:** Megatron just tore my nail off! 
  
[A Nintendo Entertainment System flies through the windshield and hits Calabasas&#39; nose, causing it to bleed.] 
  
**Calabasas:** Agh! Fuck!
 
[Finally, they drive out of the store and back onto the mall path, where they see another sliding glass door that serves as an exit to the mall.] 
 
**Calabasas:** It&#39;s an exit! Go! Go! 
 
**Vladivostok:** I am!
 
[Vladivostok rams through this exit and into the employee parking lot, where he drives past the security booth and through the metal fence in front of it.]
 
**Vladivostok:** I-I think we lost them! 
 
**Lancaster:** [A sigh of relief.]
 
**Calabasas:** Let&#39;s get off the road then! To the drainage pipe! 
 
**Vladivostok:** That&#39;s what I&#39;m doing! 
 
[Perseus drive off the main road and instead opt to take side routes to get to the drainage pipe. Their stolen vehicle has sustained high damage to the front, but not enough to total it. Calabasas takes deep breaths to regain composure. Vladivostok focuses on the journey ahead of him. Lancaster, Wally, and Dowser tend to Cap&#39;s wound on his fingernail. Perseus has nothing except half a tank of gas and two body cameras that have so far recorded everything. The sun&#39;s persistent glare continuously beats down on their necks, giving them farmer&#39;s tan. A tumbleweed bounces by.]

**Written Report**
 
HQ has finally come to the conclusion that SCP-7799-3 had lied about the body disposal area and that Perseus as a whole is deceased. Dr. Bimston announces this to the SCP-7799 Research and Containment Headquarters via email and states that &#34;whether Perseus is alive or not, Operation Perseus has proven itself to be a failure, and we will soon begin inquiring about a newer, more sustainable explorational operation in the future&#34;.

[Dr. Pen is seen sitting at his computer in his office, defeated. A lukewarm bottle of water is half drunk next to him and the room&#39;s cheap air conditioner is blowing.]
 
[Dr. Bimston enters the room.]
  
**Bimston:** Everything alright? 
 
**Pen:** What does it look like? We just sent a promising, intelligent researcher into a desert anomaly filled with psychos and you think I&#39;m alright? 
 
**Bimston:** Things happen, I guess-
 
**Pen:** I mean, what were we thinking? Sending six guys into a desert warzone with two cars and some food? 
 
**Bimston:** Pen-
 
**Pen:** Not to mention that we gave them 90s Foundation technology and multiple state-of-the-art Foundation technology drones that they couldn&#39;t even use! 
 
**Bimston:** We had to do that for reason, Pen. SCP-7799 hijacks any new-age technology that enters it. 
 
**Pen:** Yeah, yeah... I know. 
 
[Dr. Pen sighs and lays his head on his desk covered in crumpled sheets of paper filled with useless ideas and solutions.] 
   
**Bimston:** I came in here to tell you that I sent out those emails to everyone. We&#39;re going back to the drawing board it seems, and for a long time, too. 
 
**Pen:** We&#39;re going to spend our whole fucking lives on the drawing board, that&#39;s what&#39;ll happen! Life is meaningless! 
  
**Bimston:** Don&#39;t say that, Pen. We always figure something out in the end. 
 
**Pen:** Well, this time we won&#39;t. I&#39;m glad that I wasted my time on this doomed operation. 
 
**Bimston:** Pen-
 
**Pen:** Just get out of here, please. 
 
**Bimston:** Okay. I&#39;m sorry. 
 
[Bimston head of the door.] 
 
**Bimston:** Don&#39;t worry, Pen. All we need is a miracle. 
 
**Pen:** There&#39;s no such thing as miracles.
 
**Bimston:** Anything can happen, that&#39;s all I&#39;m saying. 
 
**Pen:** Whatever you say. 
 
[Bimston leaves the room to let Dr. Pen sulk in peace. The air conditioner still hums and the water bottle gets warmer.]

[Perseus are currently traveling through a long, dark drainage tunnel on the outskirts of Vienna. The dirty rain puddles on the floor are squished and splattered over the side of their vehicle as the creaking of pipes can be heard. Wally is currently sick, and has been occasionally regurgitating the stale gas station snacks out the window.]
 
[Perseus themselves are in an unfavorable state. All members are covered in minor wounds, dirt, sand, and sweat. Their clothes and uniforms are ragged and torn, a former shell of their once clean selves. Vladivostok&#39;s glasses are bent in a strange fashion. Calabasas&#39; hair is greasy and disorganized, in stark contrast to its well-tended state in the beginning.]
  
**Calabasas:** I&#39;m surprised it didn&#39;t lie to us. There really was a drainage pipe. 
 
**Vladivostok:** I told you these things were primary sources of information. We didn&#39;t listen to the gas station inhabitants and I&#39;m sure we learned our lesson from that. 
 
**Calabasas:** We didn&#39;t end up in this situation because we didn&#39;t listen to your shitty idea, Vlad. It was because you were an idiot and left our computer in vehicle two, causing me and my valiant nature to attempt and rescue it. 
 
**Vladivostok:** No, we&#39;re in this situation because you couldn&#39;t handle looking bad and made us go on some wild goose chase for a long-gone piece of shit laptop! 
  
**Calabasas:** Here we go again! You refuse to admit it, but you&#39;re jealous of me because I&#39;m a success and you&#39;re a nobody. 
 
**Vladivostok:** I-I&#39;ve been doing my best! 
 
**Calabasas:** And look at what your &#34;best&#34; has given us. We lost both our cars, the rest of the drones, four of our six body cams, and pain! 
 
**Vladivostok:** I don&#39;t understand why I&#39;m the scapegoat for everything! I- 
 
**Calabasas:** So much for somebody trying to prove himself to me. All you&#39;ve done is humiliate yourself and the rest of us. 
 
**Vladivostok:** I&#39;m not talking to you anymore. I don&#39;t care. 
 
**Calabasas:** What are you gonna do? Cry? Cry again, Vlad. After we get out of here, go home and cry to your fat slob of a mother! 
 
[Vladivostok is silent.] 
 
**Calabasas:** Yeah, that&#39;s what I thought. 
  
**Lancaster:** You need to calm down, sir- 
  
**Calalabasas:** Ah yes, calm down! That&#39;ll fix everything! [Calabasas begins to repeat &#34;calm down&#34; to himself in anger and frustration. Sunlight surrounds them again as they exit the drainage tunnel and into the empty desert. The border wall is in view.]
  
**Vladivostok:** Cal, we&#39;re- 
 
**Calabasas:** &#34;Calm down&#34;! I can&#39;t believe you said that to my fucking face, &#34;Calm down&#34;. 
 
**Vladivostok:** Cal- 
 
**Calabasas:** Why am I always surrounded by brain-dead, good-for-nothing goons that can&#39;t do anything right except ruin my life?! Why am I always destined to fail at everything because of you people?! Why were you even born?! 
 
**Vladivostok:** Cal- 
 
**Calabasas:** //WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT?!//
 
[Vladivostok flinches back as Lancaster and the privates look at Calabasas startled.]
  
**Vladivostok:** We&#39;re... we&#39;re here. [He nervously points to the stone wall that is now only one hundred meters away from them. It stands over Perseus with authority and intimidation.]
  
**Calabasas:** Oh. Well, what did I say? Through my intelligence and sharp planning prose, we made it out of this dump finally. 
 
**Lancaster:** So me and these maggots&#39; here didn&#39;t protect you on several occasions? [He stares at Calabasas with disapproval.]
 
**Calabasas:** I mean... you contributed to the cause in your own special way, unlike Vlad here. But that isn&#39;t a very high bar to pass to be fair.
 
**Lancaster:** Fuck you. Let&#39;s just get out of here. 
 
**Vladivostok:** But //how// are we going to do that? 
 
**Lancaster:** What do you mean? 
 
**Vladivostok:** It&#39;s a stone wall. There&#39;s not much else to add. How are we going to get around it? 
 
**Calabasas:** Leave the planning to the adults, Vlad. 
 
**Vladivostok:** Screw you. 
 
**Calabasas:** I personally recommend we use the vehicle&#39;s last pint of gasoline to destroy the wall and escape on foot, assuming that the SCP-7799 Research and Containment Headquarters isn&#39;t too far from here. But after all, that&#39;s just my subjective recommendation... [Chuckle]. 
 
**Lancaster:** That&#39;s a terrible idea! 
 
**Calabasas:** [Surprised] Wait, what? 
  
**Lancaster:** We can&#39;t blow up a stone wall with just a small explosion, we need dynamite or something to do that. Wouldn&#39;t those camera dudes hear it anyway? 
  
**Calabasas:** It&#39;s an amazing idea and you&#39;re wrong! 
 
**Lancaster:** Listen here, Cal... 
 
[As Calabasas and Lancaster argue to each other, Vladivostok&#39;s attention focuses on a cracked section of the wall that appears to be significantly more deteriorated than the rest of it, with raw, cracked bricks filled with holes. Vladivostok looks at it for a moment longer before speaking again.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** Guys, I have an idea. 
  
**Calabasas:** Nobody wants to hear your useless inquiries, Vlad! 
  
**Lancaster:** Let him speak. The two of us don&#39;t have any good ideas anyway, so let&#39;s hear him out. 
 
**Calabasas:** Do you really want to follow along with the plans of an incompetent loser? Why would you do that, Phil? 
 
**Lancaster:** What&#39;s the idea, Vlad? 
 
**Vladivostok:** [He points to the weak section of the wall] See that? It looks like it&#39;ll collapse soon. What if we just hit it with the bumper a couple of times to knock a hole in the wall? 
 
[Lancaster looks at the weak section of the wall for a moment.] 
 
**Lancaster:** I didn&#39;t notice that. You said we should ram into it? 
 
**Vladivostok:** Simply put, yes. 
 
**Lancaster:** I dunno. This car&#39;s taken a whole lotta beatin&#39; since we took it. 
 
**Vladivostok:** We might as well try, or else we&#39;ll just die of dehydration out here. This wall stretches for God knows how long.
 
**Lancaster:** You&#39;re right. I think we should try out Vlad&#39;s plan. Sound good, maggots? 
 
[The three privates nod in agreement. Wally can not, as he is ill, but instead gives a thumbs-up gesture.]
 
**Calabasas:** My idea was better, we should go with mine. 
 
**Lancaster:** It won&#39;t work, Cal. 
 
**Calabasas:** I am the great and democratic leader of this team, and I say we go with my plan and mine alone! 
 
**Lancaster:** Well, if you call yourself &#34;democratic&#34;, then let&#39;s hold a vote. A good leader would do that. 
 
**Calabasas:** Of course. Ahem, all in favor of my plan? 
 
[Calabasas raises his hand. The rest do not.] 
 
**Lancaster:** All in favor of Vlad&#39;s plan? 
 
[Lancaster and the privates raise their hands.] 
 
**Calabasas:** B-but that isn&#39;t fair! I-
 
**Lancaster:** C&#39;mon Vlad, hit it. 
  
**Vladivostok:** Sure thing. 
 
[Vladivostok backs the car up and aligns it toward the weakened wall section, where he revs his engine and prepares to break through it.]
 
**VladivostoK:** Everbody, duck. 
 
[The rest of Perseus duck as Vladivostok charges toward the weakened wall at the highest speed he can muster.]
 
[Upon striking it, the wall breaks, and Perseus&#39; vehicle drives into the outside world of Langtry, Texas.]
 
[After a few moments of driving, Perseus begin to realize that they have escaped back into the real world. Vladivostok begins to laugh, then, the rest of Perseus laugh similarly. Soon, all members of Perseus are laughing maniacally and hugging each other as tears stream down their faces. It is unknown if these emotions are genuine or if they are delirious due to the heat.]
 
**Calabasas:** [Laughing] W-we did it! We really did it! Haha! We did it! I-It&#39;s over! It&#39;s over... [He begins to sob.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** We did it... 
 
**Lancaster:** Take us home, Vlad! We&#39;re alive! 
 
**Cap:** A-am I dreaming? 
 
**Wally:** Yay... [He regurgitates on the car floor.]
 
**Dowser:** I&#39;m actually going home now... I&#39;m actually... home now. Home...
 
**Calabasas:** The exploration may be ruined, but I&#39;m alive! Alive! 
 
**Vladivostok:** It doesn&#39;t matter, we made it out and that&#39;s it. Shit, I&#39;m so happy that we made it, man. We really made it... 
  
**Calabasas:** To think I made it out alive with the stupidest men in the world! 
 
[The rest of Perseus look at Calabasas with disapproval.]
 
**Calabasas:** What? What&#39;s your problem? Are you sad to see me happy? 
  
**Vladivostok:** It&#39;s nothing, Cal...
 
[Perseus drive off into the sunset and make a right turn to circle the now much smaller territory, which has become one thousand meters in length again. The SCP-7799 Research and Containment Headquarters can be seen in the distance on the other side, waiting for them. Perseus has returned home. The exploration is over.]
