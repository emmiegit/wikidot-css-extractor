+ My Works
**SCPs:**

* [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7046 SCP-7046 Unwilling Blood] ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEvYYy1tu7I Audio Adaptation]) A story of grief, hubris, and mass murder, about a woman who believed she alone could save the universe from the things that dwell outside.

**Tale Series:**

__[[[i-didn-t-forget-hub|I Didn&#39;t Forget]]]__

This series of tales follows a young man&#39;s quest for the truth behind the events that took his brother away from him. He begins mostly ignorant of the true nature of the world he lives in, but his quest will put him in conflict with some of the greatest powers in the anomalous world, and force him to ask very difficult questions about the people closest to him.

+ About Me

I&#39;m a 27yo novelist from the midwestern United States. I write sci-fi and fantasy stories about strange horrors, eldrich gods, and the power of love. I often focus on LGBT themes, as well as religion, romance, and supernatural mystery.

I&#39;ve been a fan of the SCP Wiki since I discovered it more than ten years ago, but it wasn&#39;t until last year that my own writing skills grew strong enough that I felt like I could contribute to this wonderful universe. I hope all of you enjoy what I create here.

+ Off-Site
Besides being an SCP author, I also write novels. Links to all of my work, including my personal blog and an e-mailing list you can subscribe to, are available on [https://www.daviscollinsauthor.com/ my author website].

My first novel, entitled The Springstorm Alpha, is available on [https://www.amazon.com/The-Springstorm-Alpha/dp/B0BTD7DN2T Amazon], [https://www.webnovel.com/book/the-springstorm-alpha_25519290205134005 Webnovel], [http://abs.ireaderm.net/zyhw/app/app.php?ca=Share.toPcdisp&amp;bookId=12857304&amp;p2=120161&amp;lang=GLOBAL&amp;countryCode= iReader], and [https://www.dreame.com/story/1784568064-the-springstorm-alpha Dreame]. It&#39;s a paranormal romance, but it&#39;s also a mystery story about a strange town full of monsters and the brutal murder connected with it. The first few chapters are free on each of those platforms, so you might as well check it out!

I also have an [https://xhawk77x.blogspot.com/ old blog] I used to post some stories on. Among the works present there is a (basically) complete web serial called Angel of Death, which is also available on [https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/2594/angel-of-death Royal Road].</textarea></pre>
