“Well we don’t really know how it happened.  Ben and I were debating what to do with your body when all of a sudden there was a bright light, and you had changed.  After that you woke up.”

Umber got up to his legs and looked himself over and over again.  There were many questions, but nothing that could have been answered then and there.  His tenebrous shadowstuff replaced with celestial brightmatter.  It felt strange, but warm.  Stark, but refreshing.  

He hated it.

“SHADJAR!  This is the absolute worst.  How can I be part of the Cult of New Umbra when I’m mostly brightmatter.  I’m a disgrace!”  He then collapsed next to a stalagmite and placed his face in his hands as his glow slightly dimmed.

Emily and Ben floated in closer, “They can’t fix you?”

Umber mumbled through his palms.  “The artificer supreme is very talented, but would it be worth fixing me?  I’m not even a member.  I’m only... a homunculus.  Completely and utterly insignificant and disposable… Master Kiran’s words.”

Ben floated closer to Umber, but he was batted away like a mosquito.  Emily did the same, except when Umber tried to push her back, his hands simply went through her form.  “So… don’t be utterly insignificant //or// disposable.  We finish what we started.  We get back at them.”

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/cave_11.png width=&#34;200px&#34;]]

Emily’s words hung true in Umber’s head.  She was right, he thought.  If he was going to be worth his salt in the cult, he had better well prove it.  It was either that, or annihilation from the cult leaders.  He had purpose.  “You’re right.  The mission continues.  The second child cometh.”

Emily nodded and floated off into the cave to get ready and retrieve some things.  Ben floated by the entrance to stand watch.  Umber felt energized.  He felt motivated.  He felt like he could take on the entire Foundation.  **“I must train.”  Luckily for him, the cave was infested with toads, which were perfect for target practice or just a target in general.  Umber focused, put on his game face, and rushed towards the helpless amphibians.  “HYAAA!”**

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/call_peta.png width=&#34;600px&#34;]]

Ben turned around to see his master flinging toads all over the cave.  Although disturbed by this behavior, Ben did not intervene.  He had already been flung around like a weapon and learned well to remain out of arm&#39;s reach.  Better a toad than me, Ben thought.  Amphibians were pummeled and thrown, hitting the walls of the cave with wet thuds.  Umber could feel his strength returning with each toad as if one were punching a stress ball repeatedly.  Eventually he switched to grappling, wrestling several toads in a pile until his robes were soaked in mucus.

“What are you doing?”  Emily gasped as she returned an hour later from the deepest part of the cave.

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/cave_12.png width=&#34;400px&#34;]]

= “HNNG!  Trying to get this toad in a headlock and choke it to death.  Die you green menace!”

Emily shook her head.  &#34;Listen, I went to get your book and one other thing.&#34;  She produced a blue security badge.  &#34;It&#39;s from the security guard I took care of.  Thought it would be useful later.&#34; 

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/cave_14_1.png width=&#34;400px&#34;]]

Umber nodded in agreement.  Emily took the frog from him and handed him his book.  &#34;Perhaps you just leave the violence to me and leave the poor toads alone, hmm?&#34;  

&#34;Right.  I can do that.&#34;  He shuffled off into a corner with the book to study up.  &#34;I&#39;ll give it back to you after I do a little research.&#34;

Umber looked through the list of spells, and of course they all used shadow as a major component. Shadowmancy being what it is, needs shadow. Umber groaned as he glanced at page after page of inapplicable text. That was until he reached the section on metamagic enhancements and modifications. In there it detailed how to manipulate light, because what is shadow if only the spaces between light. **With a little extra, most of the shadowmancy spells could be tailored to affect light instead** and use brightmatter, the metaphysical material created by celestial light, as the principal component.

Umber flipped back to see which spells could be easily converted. To his delight, most spells involving transmutation, evocation, conjuration, and illusion would apply. Spells that were more focused on abjuration or enchantment were hit and miss it seemed. Nevertheless, at least it was better than nothing, he thought. After committing this to memory, he handed the book back to Emily. &#34;Thank you for holding onto this for me.&#34;

Emily nodded and took the book. Ben then floated towards them to rejoin the group. Umber, the leader, looked at both of them and took a breath, &#34;I think we are ready.&#34; He started walking towards the exit, Emily and Ben in tow. As the daylight filled the space of the open cave, and the morning sun crested over the trees, Umber felt no pain being in the direct beams of the sun. It was an interesting feeling overall. He stood heroic in front of his team, looking out into the surrounding green forest ready to get back on the mission. Looking up at the sky, he could easily discern east and west but still **wondered which direction to take.**
    
[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/cave_16.png width=&#34;600px&#34;]]

= Emily was trying to ignore it, but instead broke the stoic mood, &#34;Um... Umber, **are you taking a toad?**  I don&#39;t think we have the space for it.&#34; 

Umber looked up at Emily, then dug into his robes and **tossed out the maintenance badge**.  After rearranging some things, he then securely placed a floppy toad into his inner robe pocket.  &#34;There.  Now can we continue?&#34;  The toad gave a muffled croak in agreement.

Emily huffed at the toad&#39;s response.  &#34;What sagely advice.  You sure we&#39;re bringing that thing?&#34;  Already she had started to float ahead with Umber trying to keep up on his stubby legs.  &#34;If you call the toad a sage then we must take it as an omen.&#34;  Umber spoke this in a half-serious tone.  &#34;A sage is always handy.&#34;  Ben trailed between them ducking under the branches of the forest.  It was a brisk walk back to Site-81 and in the afternoon sun no less.  As Umber trudged through the leaves and sticks, as being the only on one in the group that actually walked, he started to appreciate his surroundings.

&#34;This place isn&#39;t so bad.  I was always partial to the shadows, but this is... nice.&#34;  Emily glanced over her shoulder.  &#34;It can be nice, yes.  I remember trees like this when I was a child.&#34;  As she ends her sentence, a ghostly claw passes through the bark of a young oak.  &#34;Yes, the world is nice when you are living in it.&#34;

&#34;What happened to you?  How&#39;d you get so mean?  You don&#39;t seem like you were always mean.&#34;

&#34;I wasn&#39;t.&#34;  Emily plainly stated without leaving much to answer Umber&#39;s question.

&#34;Someone pluck out your eye and you&#39;ve been a terror ever since?&#34;

&#34;I was shot in the face.  And what should have been a peaceful repose turned into my nightmare.&#34;

Umber looked at his feet, then back up to the branches filtering the sunlight.  &#34;What was dying like?&#34;

Emily didn&#39;t give any indication of emotion as she answered, “Felt like falling.  Felt like when you have a nightmare, and you know you are in a nightmare, but you can&#39;t get out.&#34;

&#34;I don&#39;t know what that&#39;s like.  I don&#39;t sleep.  But when I died, I felt nothing.&#34;

Emily stopped.  &#34;Nothing?&#34;

Umber confirmed with a nod, &#34;Yeah.  Just an end.  And that&#39;s all.&#34;

Emily stopped next to an abandoned car overgrown with weeds and brush.  &#34;Maybe the second child can help you with that?&#34;

&#34;Maybe.  What will you do after?&#34;

&#34;I don&#39;t know.  Find something else to do.  Someone else to punish.&#34;

&#34;You get tired of all that hate?&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s all I have.&#34;  Emily stated as she turned and continued down the worn path of mud and leaves.

Umber nodded and let the silence hang in the air for a few minutes until Ben broke it.  He gave a soft peal as they approached the fence line.  The trees and brush provided plenty of cover to walk up to the fence and peer down at the two buildings ahead.

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/sneak_9.png width=&#34;600px&#34;]]

One seemed to be dedicated to water, the other for air ventilation.  Both had large pipes extending down and into the ground.  The ventilation building was especially noisy as the large intake and outtake fans hummed on top of the roof.  The other building was a little louder as multiple pumps could be heard within.  Three guards were visible roaming the edge of the property.  

Emily stared out beyond the fence, **&#34;So what&#39;s the plan?&#34;** 

&#34;The plan? The plan is we get back in.&#34;

Emily looked down and squinted at Umber. &#34;Soooo… you&#39;re just going to stroll in? A //plan// Umber. Do you have one?&#34;

Umber pressed up against the chain-link fence and looked across the property.  &#34;**A few yards out, those pipes look promising.  Water processing, huh?**  Yeah I bet that&#39;s water processing alright.  These jailers have no concept of subtlety or deception.  Clearly it is not for water.&#34;

&#34;And how do you know that?&#34;  Emily dryly replied.

&#34;Look.  That guard out there next to building.  He just drank from a water bottle.  Why would he bring his own water when all the water is in the building, huh?  That means there is no water in there.  I bet it&#39;s dry as a bone inside.  I also bet that those pipes are dry.  For sure there&#39;s a way down to the sub-level from there.&#34;

Sage the toad croaked in agreement as Emily and Ben looked at one another.  &#34;That still doesn&#39;t get us from here to there.&#34;

Umber snapped his fingers at Emily.  &#34;Spellbook please.&#34;

&#34;Why?&#34;

&#34;Why what?&#34;

&#34;Why do you want the spellbook?&#34; Emily asked again.

&#34;So I can summon a unicorn to seduce the guards.  Just give me the book!&#34;  Again, there was another snap towards Emily&#39;s face.

She clenched her claws a little at that, but still produced the spellbook.  &#34;You would do well to remember who pulled you out of this place.&#34;

[[f&gt;image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/spell_2.png width=&#34;200px&#34;]]

With a toss, it flopped down at Umber&#39;s feet.  Crouched in the moss and grass, he started to turn towards the chapter on umbral portaging.  &#34;Shade messaging.  Remote shadowmancy.  Ah!  **Dark tunneling.**  Here it is.&#34;  Umber read feverishly through the page while trying to manipulate his pudgy digits to correctly form all the intricate forms needed to perform the spell.  Once memorized, Umber flipped back to the appendix of metaspells to apply it to light rather than shadow.  Luckily, it wouldn&#39;t take much extra to achieve it.

&#34;Did you know the speed of darkness is actually faster than the speed of light?&#34;  said Umber as he closed the book.

&#34;That&#39;s just not true.  It&#39;s the most not true thing ever spoken probably.&#34;  Emily sighed.

&#34;Well that&#39;s just your opinion.  But it&#39;s true.  So we&#39;ll eventually get there.&#34;  

Emily shook her head and took the book back from him, &#34;I can get in just fine.  This trip is for you and Ben.&#34;

**croak**

&#34;-and that toad.  I&#39;ll see you inside.&#34;  Emily took a step back and vanished into the bushes.  

Umber stood back up and worked up his concentration.  He furrowed his brow and recited the incantations and modifications.  His brightmatter started to sparkle as the sunlight around him coalesced against his clothes and skin.  Ben too found itself encapsulated in light as the building hum of a chorus started to permeate in the space they were standing.  Soon enough from standing to floating.  As Umber opened his eye, there was a sudden jolt.

Umber&#39;s brightmatter changed from solid matter to photons as his entire form, and Ben&#39;s, were stretched into a single line.  In about 300 nanoseconds, Umber and Ben crossed the fence line, the field, the lot, and punched a whole the size of a dime through the sheet metal of the large bay door.  With the hum of the machinery around, it wasn&#39;t even noticeable.  The light beam Umber and Ben rode through the building was even less noticeable.

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/sneak_10.png width=&#34;600px&#34;]]

A few mentionable accomplishments were achieved in that moment.  For one, Umber and Ben had made it inside.  For another, Sage the toad was officially the fastest amphibian in history.  And lastly, Umber got to experience being fully submerged for the first time.  It had appeared that the light beam pierced the thin metal door, and the top of a large storage tank of water being housed inside the building.  Once the light hit the water, it dispersed and out tumbled Umber and Ben.  Umber floundered a little and then thought how ironic it was that there actually was a great deal of water inside.  That thirsty guard was full of shit, was his next thought.

On either side, he was able to notice a couple of wide outlets.  Luckily, they were marked for maintenance workers to identify where the pipes led.  But the hatch directly below was unmarked and painted a rusty shade of red.  Umber may have been a homunculus, but he did require air to breath, although not as much as a human.  **Eventually he was going to drown if he didn&#39;t make a timely decision.** 

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/sneak_11.png width=&#34;600px&#34;]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;► Out of the Frying Pan [COMPLETE]&#34; hide=&#34;▼ Close&#34; hideLocation=&#34;both&#34;]]

**The reactor might be an interesting detour**, he thought.  It was especially attractive considering it was the pipe that was labeled with the most recognizable context.  &#39;Reactor&#39;, meaning the place where they make power.  And &#39;Pool&#39;, meaning it must lead to some lounge area for the jailers.  Nothing too dangerous there at least.

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/sneak_12.png width=&#34;600px&#34;]]

As Umber swam through the pipe, he could feel the darkness close in around himself and Ben.  The brightmatter glowed and bathed the rusty inner walls with a soft light.  Every few meters, Umber would pass by another partition of pipe connected with rivets and a thick flange.  

[[f&lt;image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/sneak_13_1.png width=&#34;200px&#34;]]

Umber still had a decent amount of air to work with, much more than what a human could store but he was still vulnerable to drowning nonetheless.  Up ahead he could see a gate valve that was swung open and plenty large enough for him to squeeze through.  

&#34;We having fun yet?&#34;

In the darkness up ahead, a bloody red eye.  Emily.  Umber gurgled a response but swam toward her, which she seemed just out of reach no matter how much distance he closed.  &#34;I don&#39;t know this place to be honest.  Never had a reason to visit this part of the facility.  Well, never had a reason to because the radiation... it does weird things to me and I don&#39;t particularly like it.  But you should be fine.  I&#39;ll catch up to you later.&#34;

And with that, the eye faded back into the blackness.  Umber rolled his eye.  Whatever that was supposed to mean, he spoke internally.  At least he could count on Ben.  After another minute of swimming, Umber hit a split in the pipe.  One end went straight up.  The other went straight down.  Not really sure which to take, he looked to Ben for guidance.  If Ben had shoulder however, it would have used them to shrug.  Then Umber had another idea as he felt Sage squirm about in his pocket.  

He pulled the toad out and held her out in front of him like a dowsing.  It was apparent which direction Sage wanted to go, as her mucusy skin allowed her to slip out of Umber&#39;s grip and paddle up the vertical pipe.  &#34;Hey!&#34;  Umber cried at her in bubbles as he took off in the same direction.  **All three of them started up.**  As they got closer and closer to the end, dark turned to blue, then blue to teal.  Then just as Sage cleared the rim of the pipe, there was an uneasy feeling of light permeating through the water.  Sage steered back toward Umber, and he was able to capture her once again.  

It appeared that they had entered a large tank of water holding.  Stuffed in the corner were dark metallic rods bathed in a strange light.  Umber could feel the humming through his body as well as the light mingling with his brightmatter in strange ways.  There was also a ladder and Umber decided it&#39;d be best not to stay in the water much longer.  He clamored out and took a deep breath of air.  Above was a platform that encircled most of the tank.  There was a lead-lined hatch that was closed and locked from the other side but also a control panel that could be accessed.

~~~~

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/sneak_14.png width=&#34;600px&#34;]]

Umber wringed out his robe on the platform and looked down at the rods.  **Each rod sat in a 4x5 grid, but with only 15 rods submerged in the water.**  The other row of five must have been housed in the other large cylinder that was coming down off the ceiling like a greek column made of lead.  Umber rubbed his head and looked back at the panel.  &#34;Loooooooooooots of buttons.&#34;

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/sneak_15.png width=&#34;600px&#34;]]

Indeed there were.  Sliders, gauges, buttons, all sorts of things to mess with.  Umber stared at it all for a full minute wondering if one of these buttons was a self-destruct.  Probably that big red one, he thought.  As he panned his vision from right to left, he noticed that on side of the panel was a monitor, and on the monitor was a familiar face.  &#34;Oh great.  **Ben, help me turn this computer off before that purple idiot starts up.**&#34; Umber said in a deadpan voice.  As he spoke the magic words, a window on the screen prompted up.

The purple avatar floated on the screen stargin back at Umber.  Of all the things he had to deal with right now, he was not wanting to deal with the dopey computer person on the other side of the glass.  

Umber then groaned.

Loud enough that it echoed off the walls of the shielded chamber and hung in the air like a fart in church.  &#34;Shadjar!  Why can&#39;t you just go away?&#34;

Umber huffed, Sage croaked, and Ben was still fascinated with the multitude of blinking lights on the console.  He knew that he was not going to figure out how to work this contraption without blowing himself up or the second child.  Neither would be desireable.  He knew this was a second chance and he did not need to blow.  Scrambling up near the console to get a better look, Umber started to form his questions for Virgil.

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/AIC.png width=&#34;40px&#34;]]
= ###9966ff|Certainly, brother!  What you are looking at is the fission reactor control console.  There is a counterpart console located outside the chamber, but this one is directly hardwired into the control rod manipulator for direct adjustments.##

@@@@
@@@@

|| Alright.  Now explain all that again so I can understand it. ||

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/AIC.png width=&#34;40px&#34;]]
= ###9966ff|You got it, zippy!  The fission reactor is how the site generates power.  The control rods control the reactor, either by increasing or decreasing the reaction or power generated.  Currently fifteen of twenty are engaged.  The more you lift up, the more power.  Does that make sense now?##

@@@@
@@@@

|| Better.  Now tell me how to shut it down. ||

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/AIC.png width=&#34;40px&#34;]]
= ###9966ff|Whoa there, dudebro.  Let&#39;s pump the brakes a little.  Currently the H through K wings are experiencing high power swings.  The backup generators are not equipped to handle the approximate load at this time, so shutting down could have catostrophic consequences up to including a site breach.  Activating the SCRAM would make for a rough week for sure.##

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/AIC.png width=&#34;40px&#34;]]
= ###9966ff|It&#39;s the killswitch.  When activated, boric acid will flood the coolant pool, essentially choking off the reactor for at least twenty-four hours.  Thankfully only designated users have access inside this chamber, and even fewer have an arming key.  That is unless someone lost their&#39;s recently and it was haphazardly picked up by someone else.  But I ain&#39;t got time to worry about that!  Know what I mean, hombre.##

[[/div]]

Umber and Ben looked at one another as if they just discovered where the exposed nerve of the site was.  He looked down into the glowing pool and sure enough, counted fifteen rods submered into their respective holes with five of them open.  Umber wasn&#39;t a nuclear scientist, but he could understand enough to be dangerous with this new information.  **Now it was just needing to know what to do with it.**

He put his hand along the control panel and was surprised to see that there were no screws of any kind.  It was almost as if the panel was shielded and then welded shut to prevent tampering.  

&#34;Well that&#39;s inconvienient.&#34;  He stated as a matter of factly as he rubbed his hand down the corner of the left side.  He sighed but then remembered he did have something else on hand that just might work.

**Umber fumbled for the key in his inner pocket.**  Once retrieved, he looked at it intently, and then looked at the lock he was going to try to fit it in.  After a little scrambling up onto the control panel, he pushed the tip in.  Surprisingly, it glided through the tumblers with ease until it hilted into the lock.  As if under possession, Umber mindlessly turned the fob.  There were a series of clicks and the button to the SCRAM started to glow red.  **Umber then pushed the red button.**

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/sneak_16.png width=&#34;600px&#34;]]

There was a sudden whir of motors as the chamber echoed with a cacophonous roar.  The gauges and instruments pegged to maximum as the large control rod chamber lowered down and choked the reactor.  The coolant was flooded with a milky substance as well.  The strange feeling in the pit of his stomach waned as the glow died in the water.  Then it was silent.  Umber looked behind him to see the screen, which was flashing red with a large explanation point. 

&#34;Uh, oh... somehow I don&#39;t feel all that great about my decision.&#34;

The blaring alarm that was coming from outside the chamber was enough to snap Umber out of it.  There was a hatch off the side that seemed to be the only way in or out, besides the pipe he just swam up.  The emergency lights suddenly flickered on with their red bulbs as the fluorescents died instantly in the chamber.

&#34;Ok, that&#39;s a little alarming.&#34;

Umber looked and nudged Ben for a reaction, but nothing.  Ben turned and sternly &#34;looked&#34; back at his master with gross disapproval.  Umber was forced to swallowed his failed joke.  For a brief moment he wondered if his joke was either bad or it was Ben&#39;s fault for not getting it.  Probably the latter, he concluded.  While fumbling in the dark, Umber pulled the key from the lock and tossed it into the pool so they couldn&#39;t get it back easily.  Though hard to see, the key made an audible &#39;plunk&#39; as it hit the water and sank.  Umber could also hear people.  People in a big old hurry as well as muffled shouting.  Umber took a deep satisfaction now that the entire site was plunging into chaos with no main power.  

He looked back at the screen one last time and was surprised to see it still had power.  Luckily, it was no longer flashing red and Virgil&#39;s avatar was back.

&#34;Thanks.&#34;  Although it was more of the way Umber said thanks that made it really feel like he was saying, &#34;Fuck you.&#34;  There was a bang on the metal hatch door as the scramble of people behind it began to manually pry open the locks to get into the chamber.  Another bang as the locks started to pull out from the corners.  Shreds of light started to invade into the dark space as a flashlight waggled back and forth between the splitting seams.

&#34;Who&#39;s in there!&#34;, yelled a deep voice from behind the hatch.

**Umber had an idea.  It might not have been a good idea, but it was an idea.**  As the bottom door latch was released, it started to slowly swing open into the dark reactor room.  Umber cleared his throat and shouted back.

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/sneak_18.png width=&#34;500px&#34;]]

&#34;Y... yeah!  Fuck off Keith!  This is... this is Major Murdeath of the chaos insurgency!  Surrender now and you will receive a painfu- painless death!&#34;

The two technicians seemed to halt in their entry.  The crowbar dropped to the ground on the other side as there shadows drifted back into the other room.  After a moment of awkward silence, faint mumbling could be heard on the other side of the door.

^^&#34;We should call the MTF.  Do you have a radio on you?&#34;^^

^^&#34;Good choice.  Here.  Whatever is in there we don&#39;t need to get it angry.&#34;^^

= &#34;ACK!  Don&#39;t do that!&#34;

Emily&#39;s presence suddenly manifested next to him in the dark.  Umber became so startled that he actually dropped Sage to the ground, which made a similar sound akin to dropping a wet towel onto a tile floor.  On the other side of the door, the two technicians mumbled and argued about what to do.  Again, Emily addressed Umber, &#34;The radioactivity prevented me from getting close to it, good job at shutting it off.  But what are you doing, now?&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m trying to scare these technicians to off so I can make an escape.&#34; Umber explained in a whispered tone.

&#34;...scare?&#34;

&#34;Yes.&#34; 

&#34;...you?&#34;

&#34;YES, EMILY!&#34;

&#34;Want me to just...&#34;

Umber rolled his eye and then crouched down to pick up his floppy amphibian companion.  &#34;If you must... go ahead.&#34;  As he looked back up, she was gone.  Before Umber could ask where she had wandered off too, there was the bloody gurgled scream of someone’s throat being ripped open.

Umber listened as they collapsed in front of the door.  A leg flailed out as one of them twitched in their death throes.  Emily could be seen in the shadows raising a claw and plunging it deep into flesh.  Ben watched in morbid curiosity, as the technician was relieved from the burden of his duties.  Umber, however, felt pretty uncomfortable seeing Emily in her true form.  Blood pooled and run under the seam of the door as it leaked into the cold reactor.  &#34;Come in, Umber.&#34;

Umber and Ben obeyed, stepping over bodies and into the main control room, which was not all that special from the reactor.  The control panel was an identical setup.  An exit sign was clearly labeled on the other side of the room and a single bathroom was adjacent.  The window across the control panel overlooked some of the other facilities.  The MTF was entering through the gates as soldiers poured off the transports.  Heavy armored vehicles were deployed, as well as helicopters and boats over the lake.  Fire erupted from a manhole that was connected to the sub-level.  Gunshots were popping off sporadically.  The radio chatter sounded urgent with people talking over each other.  It was a containment breach.

[[f&gt;image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/sneak_22.png width=&#34;400px&#34;]]

&#34;UMMMMMBEEERRRRRRR... Look at what you have done.  Glorious isn&#39;t it?&#34;

Emily shoved the bodies into the reactor and shut the door before gliding over behind Umber.  Her bloodied claws gripped his sides as she watched the chaos from the window as well.  Her eyes swelled and her voice dropped an octave as she spoke haunting words.

&#34;SEE THE WICKED?  SEE HOW THEY SCUTTLE LIKE ANTS?  WE ARE THE POISON IN THEIR COLONY, UMBER.  WE WILL LET THIS PLACE RIP ITSELF INSIDE-OUT.  WE WILL LET THESE MEN AND WOMEN BE EATEN BY THE HUNGRY HORRORS WITHIN.  I WILL RIP OUT THE THROATS OF THOSE TRYING TO FLEE AND TOSS THEIR WORTHLESS HUSKS BACK INTO THE WATER OF THE LAKE AS IT CHANGES FROM BLUE TO RED.  AND I WILL LAUGH AS THEIR BLOATED CORPSES LITTER THE SHORES LIKE DEAD FISH.  AND THEY WILL KNOW THAT IT WAS ME.  THEY WILL KNOW.&#34;

Her eye shrunk back down as she turned towards Umber. &#34;Doing what?&#34;

&#34;Getting crazy with revenge... and ignoring my personal space.  Also, your claws are... really unsanitary.  Could you maybe not wipe the fluids of slaughtered humans on my robe... p-please?&#34;

&#34;I&#39;M NOT THE ONE BEING WEIRD AND CREEPY RIGHT NOW!  CERTAINLY NOT!&#34;

&#34;Fine.  I just thought we could enjoy a moment.&#34;

~~~~

Emily begrudgingly released Umber and backed off, but still watched the outside as people were trying to push through the gates and evacuate simultaneously.  Umber waddled over to the sink in the bathroom and wiped the blood off his robe with a little water.  &#34;We can&#39;t waste anymore time.  The second child is probably unguarded but vulnerable.  **Let&#39;s get into where the cells are.**&#34;

Emily listened while watching hordes of MTF operatives jog towards the eastern trail which leads to the lakeshore.  Others started to flood into the admin building.  Everywhere else was relatively ungauarded as all attention seemed to be focused on entering the sub-levels.  Emily refocused and looked back at Umber, who was drying off the wet spot with some toilet paper.  &#34;Ok.&#34;

Umber shuffled out into the open and crouched into a ditch.  &#34;We can follow this ditch back to the jailer&#39;s offices,&#34; he whispered.  

Emily paused a bit before responding. &#34;We were already there.&#34;

&#34;I know.&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s where you got shot.&#34; 

&#34;I know.&#34;

&#34;And died.&#34;

&#34;I KNOW, EMILY!&#34;

&#34;Hmmm?  What was that?&#34;  A nearby guard trotted over to check out what he thought he heard.  Umber hunkered down into the weeds even harder as Emily dissipated.  Ben also crouched low, but refused to get into the mud and dirty themselves.  Luckily, Sage gave out a timely croak right as the boots of the jailer reached the edge of the ditch.  

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/sneak_25.png width=&#34;500px&#34;]]

= **CROAK**

&#34;Pfft.  Frogs.&#34;  The heavy footfalls of the guard started to move away. Now muddied, Umber scrambled up to the top of the dich to peek out.  It appeared as though forces were still mobilizing towards the east.  Folks in labcoats and suits were moving north towards the exit.  It appeared to be an evacuation and an assault to secure the site.  &#34;They do look pretty busy.  Let&#39;s keep moving.&#34;

Umber crawled another few dozen yards to reach the north entrance of the building once again.  &#34;Emily, can you use your keycard?&#34;  Emily reappeared crouched next to him, &#34;Of course.&#34;  She then disappeared, and then reappeared next to the door.  With a quick swipe, the front entrance unlocked and she ushered for Umber to enter.  Umber got up, scuttled over the road, and dove inside before anyone could see him.   

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/sneak_26.png width=&#34;500px&#34;]]

Inside was dark and empty.  The air was different however, as if the smell of Emily&#39;s cave somehow made it in.  Ben and Emily also slipped through the door and locked it behind them.  Umber was familiar with the layout with the building especially since he took extensive photos with the phone.  Echoed sounds from below could be heard, but indiscernible.  **&#34;Alright, I remember this place now.  Where to?&#34;**

Virgil happily chirped back at the director from the wall screen.  &#34;No siree-bob!  But somehow they got their hands on a keycard.  Should I deactivate the card, bossman?&#34;

The director leaned back in his chair, letting it creak slowly as he puzzled over his next move.  &#34;No.  Let us see what they are after exactly.  Keep an eye on them and have Special Task Force Zeta-5 trail behind until I say to subjugate them.&#34;

Umber looked about the hallways once inside.  He remembered most of this building but needed a reminder.  Umber pulled out his phone, and tried to look at the [*http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/Admin_Map_2F.PNG pictures of the building interior].  &#34;Ah... ok... So we are here!&#34;  He pointed at the screen on the phone to show to Emily.

 Emily rolled her bloodied eye and moved Umber&#39;s finger a half inch to the left.  He nodded and continued, &#34;Yes... there.  **And there&#39;s a storage room, here.  You got a card to get in.  I say we snoop there before heading down to the sub-levels.**&#34;

 &#34;Oh captain, my captain.&#34;  Emily responded in an unenthusiastic and monotone voice as she floated by him.  Clearly, she was ticked off about something, but Umber pushed the notion out of his thoughts and focused on the mission.  &#34;Come along, Ben.&#34;  The trio easily walked through the hallways since it was evacuated.  The emergency lighting provided enough ambiance as they made their way through the double doors and up to the storage room entrance.  &#34;Open sesame.&#34;  Said Emily as she swiped the security badge along the reader.  Even in emergency power mode, the site still had enough juice to make sure the locks and badge readers worked.  Only essential functions.

 The card reader gave the green light and an agreeable beep as the deadbolt lock retracted.  Umber stepped through Emily and pushed the door open to view shelves and shelves of boxes.  &#34;AHA!  Human treasure.  A box repository.  So many... you think this also doubles as a place of worship?&#34;

 Emily panned her head from side to side.  &#34;As a former human, I argue against your theory on human box fetishism.&#34;

 &#34;Noted.&#34;  Umber looked over his shoulder.  &#34;But then why so many boxes, huh?&#34;

 Emily sighed and dropped her claws to her side.  &#34;I don&#39;t have a good answer for that.  Let&#39;s be quick, yeah?&#34;

 Something they could both agree on.  Umber looked to Ben, &#34;Look around and see if you can find something useful.&#34;  Ben bobbed up and down and flew up and over a shelf out of sight.  Umber began the dig into a shelf along the wall.  **Pens, staplers, notepads, paperclips, tape, and any other generic small office supply item were displayed in open bins.**  Umber mulled over a travel size bottle of hand sanitizer.  &#34;The shadow is this stuff?  It&#39;s a... thick water?  Why would humans need thick water?&#34;  He gave the bottle a squeeze as a spurt of it landed right in his eye.

 [[f&gt;image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/sneak_28.png width=&#34;500px&#34;]]

 &#34;GAH!  IT BURNS!  SHADOW SAVE ME!&#34;

 Emily rushed over and batted the hand sanitizer out of his hand.  &#34;Umber what happened?  Is it venom?&#34;

 &#34;YES!  SHADJAR!&#34;  

 &#34;How can I remove it?  Should I cut it out?&#34;

 &#34;CUT OUT THE VENOM!?!  NO!!!&#34;  He would have pushed her away if he could have.  &#34;Just!  Just give me a second... I think the pain is going away.  Nebcharzz!  That hurts.&#34;

 Emily nodded; she then looked at the bottle lying on the floor and read the back label.  &#34;Hand Sanitizer.  Flammable, keep away from fire or flame.  Do not swallow.  Avoid contact with eyes.&#34;

 &#34;Well now it tells me!&#34;  Umber rubbed his eye vigorously to get his tears to wash out the hellish concoction.  Emily continued to read.  &#34;Keep away from children.  Why children?&#34;  She looked at Umber, then back at the label, then back at Umber.  &#34;...ah.&#34;

 &#34;What?&#34;  Umber pivoted around to look at Emily, his eye was almost as red as hers.

 &#34;Nothing.&#34;  She quickly replied.

 [[f&lt;image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/sneak_27.png width=&#34;500px&#34;]]

 They are both interrupted when the unmistakable sound of Ben&#39;s ringing alerts both of them.  At the top of the highest shelf, Ben had found something interesting in an open box.  Umber looked back down, a balled fist in his eye trying to rub out the last remnants of the bottled venom.  &#34;I&#39;m going to go see what Ben found.&#34;  Placing a foot and hand on the shelves ready to ascend, he looked at Emily one last time.  &#34;Go see if the coast is clear to make it down the stairwell?&#34;  She nodded and vanished.

 Umber ascended the mountain of shelves that nearly scraped the ceiling tiles as he made his way toward Ben.  &#34;What do we have, Ben?&#34;  Ben excitedly bobbed up and down at its discovery as Umber leaned over to peek inside, but was interrupted by Emily coming back suddenly.  

 &#34;Clear all the way down to the door.&#34;

 Umber was startled and lost his grip in one hand but was able to maintain grip on the other.  He dangled like a Christmas ornament, looking down at Emily.  &#34;Excellent.  Let me just see what&#39;s up here and I&#39;ll be right down.&#34;  Swinging back over, he pulled himself back up to the top shelf and peeked inside the box.

 Inside were three glass objects and a piece of blue paper.  It had some limited information but Umber dutifully took a note of it for later use.  &#34;Good work, Ben.&#34;  Looking down, he then started his descent.  Emily waited patiently for him at the bottom.  &#34;You don&#39;t think this is too easy do you?&#34;  

 Umber continued down the shelves.  &#34;What do you mean by that?&#34;

 &#34;I mean, there&#39;s nobody here.  During a lockdown there&#39;s at least somebody in the building.&#34;

 &#34;You&#39;re paranoid... HUP!&#34;  Umber jumped down with three shelves left to go, but managed to make a good landing.  &#34;They all evacuated.  No reason to think that-&#34;

 &#34;-It&#39;s a trap?&#34;  Emily interjected.

 &#34;I was going to say no reason to think that anyone would be left behind.  You saw all the staff leaving.  The rest went east towards the lake.  We&#39;re fine.&#34;  Umber confidently walked past her, but her words started to dig into his head a little.  What if it were a trap?  How would he know?  And what they would have to do if it were.  Stepping out of storage, the hallways were dim and deserted.  He walked over towards the stairwell and it too was as quiet as the void.  &#34;**We need to get down there.**” Umber started heading down with renewed caution.  Emily and Ben picked up the rear as they made their way down.  It was darker than last time they were down there, which was when Umber was killed.  He unconsciously rubbed his chest where the hole was blasted into him a week ago.  

 At the bottom of the stair, he could make out the two sets of double doors.  One he knew led to the armory, the other towards the bulkhead that blocked the entrance into much wanted sub-levels.  Emily crouched down to address the frozen homunculus at the bottom of the step.  &#34;**What now?**&#34; 
**&#34;Well we should probably hit the armory.&#34;** Umber responded as he turned and looked at the door.  Another keycard reader.  &#34;If you don&#39;t mind?&#34;  Umber motioned toward the door and the empty post where a guard would have been stationed if not for the evacuation of the building.  Emily swiped the badge and opened it up to the familiar room they were in a week prior.  The smell of musty concrete and freshly cured paint filled the room as the fluorescents above flickered on.  Rows and rows of weapons and ammunition.  &#34;Alright.  Spread out and lets see what we can dig up.&#34;  Emily, Ben, and Umber each went their own direction and spent a good amount of time rummaging through the boxes and lockers of the armory.

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/armory_11.png width=&#34;500px&#34;]]

Sage croaked unexpectedly as Umber was looking at some rifles.  &#34;Hmm?  What&#39;s that Sage?&#34;

&#34;She&#39;s a frog Umber.&#34;  Emily&#39;s voice echoed in along the walls of the bunker. 

&#34;I know.  Did you find anything yet?&#34;

&#34;Maybe.  You?&#34;

Umber looked up and the shelf adjacent and peered at the Kevlar vests.  After rubbing his chest where a massive gaping wound would have been, he then pulled the smallest vest he could find.  &#34;I think so... though I&#39;m not sure it will fit.  Ok, everyone regroup.&#34;  Ben and Emily reappeared back into the main aisle to show their swag: 

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/armory_12.png width=&#34;500px&#34;]]

* a vest of bullet resistance
* a gun
* and a bomb

&#34;....Ben where did you get a bomb?&#34;  Umber looked up at Ben who had the round metal ring looped around the top of it.  Ben merely nodded in the direction of an aisle named &#39;ORDNANCE AND HIGH EXPLOSIVES&#39;.  &#34;Oh.... alright then.&#34;

Emily piped up, **&#34;Umber, we can&#39;t carry all of this.  Do we need any of it?&#34;**

**&#34;You&#39;re right, we don&#39;t.  We aren&#39;t here to start a war.&#34;**  And with that, the gang then dropped their items on the nearest shelf.  &#34;We should really be more focused on getting past that big door.&#34;  Umber led them all back into the hallway and towards the large bulkhead.  Sage once again gave a very loud and pronounced croak.

= **CROAK**

 &#34;What is with her?&#34;  Emily looked down at Umber&#39;s pocket.

 &#34;No idea, but we should keep moving.&#34;  Ben was already at the door, floating along the seams of the metal slab and concrete walls to look for weaknesses.  There was none.  It was solid enough to take a direct hit from an energy blast, an acidic discharge, or some other destructive force.  The locks on the bottom, which bolted it the bulkhead securely to the ground, looked just as tough, if not tougher.  Even if Umber had a cutting torch, it&#39;d take the better part of a night and day to cut into them.  &#34;Well... shadjar.  Any ideas?&#34;

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/access_1.png width=&#34;600px&#34;]]

 Umber looked through his phone for those plans he pulled a while back.  Going through the gallery he concentrated hard at [*http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/Admin_Map_B.PNG one picture] and [*http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/Admin_Diagram_B.png then another].  Emily looked over his shoulder to observe.  Both of them stood in silent thought until Umber looked up at the ghostly woman.  &#34;Emily, can&#39;t you just... you know... go through it?&#34;  He pointed at the door with a stubby digit.

 &#34;I can.  But how would I get everything else through there?&#34;

 &#34;Fair point.&#34;

 Sage then gave another croak, this time it rang loud and echoed against the walls of concrete.  

[[=]]
++ CROAK!
[[/=]]

 &#34;Sage, please be quiet.&#34;  Umber bopped his pocket to get her attention.  Sage wriggled a little but not much else.  Ben started to float back down to the group, now convinced that there were no obvious points of entry like a vent or something but also interested in the sudden activity the toad was giving off.

 &#34;Maybe she&#39;s trying to tell us something?&#34;

 &#34;Yeah?  Like hurry up!  Let&#39;s get this door open now.&#34; Umber said impatiently.  &#34;This our second time down here and it gives me the creeps.&#34;

 &#34;...is that because you died here?&#34;

 &#34;Yes!  Yes, Emily it&#39;s because I died here!  Can you shut up about it!?!&#34;  Umber crossed his arms in a huff.

 Emily didn&#39;t react much with her motions as she continued.  &#34;I understand.  I would feel the same way.&#34;  Umber sighed and rubbed his temples to try to shake off the strange vibes he was experiencing.

&#34;Sorry.  I don&#39;t mean to be snippy.  I&#39;m just-  I&#39;m frustrated.  I feel like we&#39;re not making much progress and I&#39;m not the most patient or used to working in teams.&#34;

&#34;Neither am I.  Actually it&#39;s rather nice.&#34;  Her blank dead stare gave no indication as to her emotions, but the inflection in her voice certainly did.  Umber nodded solemnly.  &#34;Yeah... it is.&#34;  In reality, he had no idea what was going to happen to Emily after the mission was done with.  It was not his place to bring others into the cult of new umbra, but at the same time, he did feel obligated to try and do right by her.  Again, more things to shelve for after the mission.  **&#34;OK.  How about this door then?&#34;** 

[[f&gt;image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/door.png width=&#34;200px&#34;]]

**&#34;Well it seems like all we have to do is turn this green wheel and the door should slide open.&#34;** Umber noted as he put the phone away.  Emily nodded and glided one step back as Ben floated on the otherside of its master.  Umber rubbed his digits together and set Sage on the floor as he gripped the wheel.  &#34;Alright... 3... 2... 1... FNGNGH!&#34;

The door creaked and groaned as the gears ground against one another.  There was an unmistakable squeal of metal on metal as the metal slab started to roll along its bearings.  It moved an impressive half an inch before there was a clang emanating from the floor.  

Emily and Ben looked down to notice that the hydraulic locks along the bottom of the door where still engaged.  Umber felt the resistance and doubled his efforts, rocking it back and forth.  There was another metal on metal clang as the door was once again stopped by the immovable locks.

[[f&gt;image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/door_2.png width=&#34;230px&#34;]]

 Emily winced as she watched Umber groan against the wheel.

&#34;Al... Almost th-there!&#34;  His whole body shook as he put all he got into turning the wheel.  To save him the embarrassment, Emily crouched down and put an arm around him.  &#34;Umber?&#34;

 &#34;Not now!  It&#39;s giving way... I can feel it.&#34;

 &#34;Umber, this isn&#39;t going to work.&#34;

 &#34;Yes it is!  FNGH!&#34;

 The little homunculus&#39;s hand-sewn stitching started to pop as he strained even harder.  Emily looked up at Ben, but Ben knew better than to interrupt the master.  She then gave Umber an attention-getting pat on the back.  

~~~~

 [[f&gt;image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/door_3.png width=&#34;270px&#34;]]

**&#34;Look.  The locks.  There are two of them.&#34;**  She pointed emphatically.  &#34;That door is not going anywhere unless those are disengaged.&#34;  Umber opened his eye to look, and sure enough, half an inch was all he was going to muster with the locks there.  &#34;Ah... well then...&#34;  He let go of the wheel slowly.  &#34;How about we turn on the motors then?&#34;

Emily nodded and stood back up.  &#34;Sure, but the locks will still be engaged.&#34;  Umber rubbed his sore digits and located the breaker panel on the side of the bulkhead.  Upon opening the panel he could see that there was in fact power running to the motors, locks, and lights.  The gentle hum of the generators behind them confirmed that the whole circuit was powered by the generators now.  **&#34;Somehow we need to disengage the locks if we want to get the door open.&#34;**

Emily huffed, &#34;That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been trying to-&#34;

Umber then threw up a hand to interrupt.  &#34;Quiet, I have to think.&#34; 

Umber stroked his chin looking at the door and circuit breakers.  **He jiggled the breaker that was labeled &#39;B2&#39; but did not notice anything other than a small set of green LED lights on each hydraulic piston flickering on and off.  &#34;Well that&#39;s not helping much.&#34;  Walking back over to the wheels, Umber steadied his grip on the purple one and started to turn it.  With almost instant results, the slow hiss of hydraulic fluid began to drain from the pistons and they both started to release and sink into the floor.**  With a heavy clunk, the solid metal locks eventually bottomed out into their respective cavities.  It would take a herculean amount of effort to build the hydraulic pressure back up to relock them, or just simply turn on the pumps.

 &#34;Aha!  Unlocked.&#34;  Umber smiled broadly at another victory to scratch next to the longer list of failures and accidents that somehow got them back into the facility.  Ben floated back to his master to bask in confidence and ego.  Feeling rather triumphant then, Umber was about to take another crack at the green wheel when he had the brilliant thought.  &#34;Emily, why don&#39;t you peek through and see what&#39;s on the other side.&#34;

 Emily turned to him and tilted her head.  &#34;I can&#39;t believe I never thought of that before.&#34;  Emily placed both hands on the solid bulkhead, closed her eye, and stuck her head cleanly through.  Phasing one&#39;s head through metal has a variety of interesting side effects that most would not think of.  For one, a similar effect of brain freeze happens as head and object interact with one another trying to squeeze into the same space.  Another is the unmistakable taste of whatever you are passing through saturating your mouth and nose.  Although being dead has a great advantage to all this uncomfortable effects as you need to have senses to be uncomfortable.

[[div style=&#34;text-align: left; background: #000; padding: 5px; color: #fff;&#34;]] 

 It only took a brief three seconds to phase through the plated metal and concrete.  Emily then opened her eye to observe the dark interior.  Nothing was terribly surprising.  It was dark, but not too terrible.  She peered out ahead to try and catch a glimpse of anything out there.

 At first it looked like a whole lot of still air.  The back wall could not even be made out.  Suddenly there was the distinct croak of Sage from the other side of the bulkhead.  

= **//CROAK//**

Emily used her hand to hold a finger up to Umber in hopes that he is able to quiet the toad who has literally been croaking every other minute since being down in the sub-level.  

&#34;That&#39;s better.&#34;  She whispered to herself.  

The suddenly there was the unmistakable sound of patter coming out from the dark.  Emily squinted to see if her vision could cut through the blackness as something started to emerge.

 Emily then retrieved her head, pausing only for a second or two before interrupting Umber&#39;s attempt at turning the green wheel.  &#34;Umber.  We might have trouble.&#34;

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/access_8.png width=&#34;600px&#34;]]

 &#34;What do you mean?&#34;

 &#34;There&#39;s about five guns behind this wall.&#34;

&#34;G-guns?&#34;  Umber rubbed his sore chest. 

[[=]]
++ CROAK!
[[/=]]

Before Emily could explain further, the hum of electricity could be heard as the motors around the bulkhead started to whir into action.  It was apparent that something has seized control of the bulkhead and it wasn&#39;t them.  **With a wailing grind, it started to slowly slide open.**  Suddenly the intercom chirped as a voice crackled through the loudspeaker.  It was unmistakable as it was loud.

[[=]]

[NO HARD FEELINGS, CHAMP.]

[BOSSMAN HAS ME RUNNING ERRANDS.]

[IF YOU THREE WOULD JUST SURRENDER, WE COULD WORK SOMETHING OUT THAT DOESN&#39;T INVOLVE KILLING.]

[OK, BUCKAROO?]

[[/=]]

&#34;Shadjar!  Double Shadjar!&#34;  Umber yelled.  &#34;Curse you, Virgil!&#34;  

His yelling did not impede the bulkhead door, which was still creaking open at a sloth&#39;s pace.  Emily looked to Umber with urgency.  &#34;Let&#39;s not get you shot again.&#34;

&#34;Agreed.  Back to the armory!&#34;  Umber grabbed Emily&#39;s hand, but it was like grabbing air.  &#34;Oh... right.  Just follow then.  Ben, you too!&#34;

&#34;Don&#39;t forget Sage!&#34;  Emily reminded him as she phased into an adjacent wall to enter the armory.  Umber was in mid-step when before he pivoted around and retrieved the green lump off the floor.  Sage gave another loud croak as a gun barrel protruded through the ever-widening space and took a few scattered shots at Umber.

[[=]]

[CONTACT]

**BRAAAAP!**

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/access_9.png width=&#34;600px&#34;]]

&#34;Oh Shadow!  Don&#39;t let me die again!&#34;

[[/=]]

The assailant let off a quick three round burst, luckily missing Umber as he scampered off around the corner.  The bullets ricocheted off the concrete walls and floor before falling silent.  The bulkhead squeaked loudly as Special Task Force Zeta-5 started to file through the opening one at a time.  By then however, Umber, Sage, Ben, and Emily were in the armory pushing a large cabinet in front of the door.  There was no power still but **they had a good look around beforehand to see what was there.**  Frankly, it was a treasure trove of everything a mobile task force would ever want or need to head off a full scale assault or at least put on one hell of a show before dying.   

&#34;Well, now we are back in here.  Wish I would have taken one of those big guns now.&#34;  Umber panted, still trying to catch his breath after running for his insignificant life.  There were humans coming that wanted him dead... again.  Ben floated away from the group back towards the &#39;ORDNANCE AND HIGH EXPLOSIVES&#39; bin in the southeast corner of the room.  Emily was rummaging through some bulletproof vests, something in Umber&#39;s size.  She didn’t need one at least.  Sage was... Sage.  Seems like everyone was in action except Umber, but he had to reel in his team.  Any second they were going to be looking down the barrels of guns.  Guns in the hands of very well trained humans that had no qualms shooting first and asking later, if at all.  All Umber had was an armory, his spellbook, and his friends.  **He formulated a plan.**

[[div style=&#34;text-align: left; background: #000; padding: 5px; color: #fff;&#34;]]

Four of them had huddled near the shelves that where the vests of bullet resistance were stacked.  It was nearly pitch black inside being underground with no power As Umber wriggled into one of the vests he laid out his idea.  **&#34;We have to fight them off.&#34;**  There was a pause amongst them as the realization of their situation sank in.  Umber took another big breath and started again on his idea.  &#34;First we need to throw our supplies in one of the lockers.  Emily, all I need is the book.&#34;

She nodded and slid it across the floor towards him.  &#34;What kind of spell are you thinking of?&#34;  She asked.

&#34;Something nasty, but it won&#39;t be enough.  **I&#39;ll need your claws.&#34;**

&#34;I feel like I&#39;m always getting my hands wet when I&#39;m with you... and I like it.&#34;

**Umber nodded as he emptied his pockets and stuffed them into an adjacent locker; Sage included.** The toad croaked loudly as he placed the green lump on top of the belongings: the phone, the amulet of knife summoning, and the security key card Emily was carrying.  Umber closed the door and ushered Ben over.  &#34;Protect our stuff and try not to get in the fight.  Only when we are in real trouble.&#34;  Ben bobbed up and down and then took a sentry position in front of the locker.

There was a clatter outside as Special Task Force Zeta-5 made their way down the hallway and towards the armory.  &#34;Umber, they are close.&#34;  **Emily floated back over and picked up a grenade.  &#34;I&#39;ll buy you a little time so you can get your spell ready.&#34;**

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/armory_13.png width=&#34;600px&#34;]] 

[[f&gt;image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/spell_3.png width=&#34;250px&#34;]]

Thumbing through the pages as quickly as he could, Umber scanned for something to fight with.  It was time to show some teeth at these jailers.  It was time for them to face the wrath of the Cult of the New Umbra.  It was the least of what they deserved.

As he scanned the book chapters and sub-chapters for an appropriate spell, the clamor outside grew closer.  The green glow of the night vision on their heads peered through the glass.  Laser dots danced along the floor searching for a target as two of the jailers held their position.  The other three however, were working on the door, which was thankfully without power.  Umber finally landed on the chapters of shadow evocation and inwardly cheered as his nubby digits scanned the text of a promising spell.  &#34;Ha... The Flying Spears of the Black Voivode.  Most effective.  Now to work out the modifications to use brightmatter.&#34;

&#34;Found it?&#34;  Emily whispered from the other side.

Umber responded with a thumbs-up back at her.

&#34;Good.&#34;

[[=]]

[ZETA ONE, WE HAVE NOISES COMING FROM INSIDE.  NO VISIBILITY.]

[STANDBY ZETA FOUR, POWER NEARLY RESTORED.  HOLD POSITION AT THE WINDOW.]

[[/=]]

There was the quiet sound of a metal click as Emily removed the pin of her grenade.  Umber&#39;s eye went wide as he saw this.  The blast would surely kill him in the concrete bunker of the armory.  He was almost about to shout at her when he noticed her counting slowly to herself.

&#34;2...&#34;

&#34;3...&#34;

At the last second, Emily phased the grenade and her arm through the wall and politely presented it to the two jailers by the window.

&#34;4...&#34;

[[=]]
+ BOOM!
[[/=]]

There was a mighty concussion of air and glass as it sprayed into the armory.  Umber ducked back behind the shelves to avoid debris.  The window and surrounding wall was destroyed.  Without even a second delay, the remaining three members of Zeta-5 were stepping over the broken bodies of the other two and shuffling in, guns hot.

[[=]]

[ZETA FOUR AND FIVE ARE DOWN!]

[ENGAGE HOSTILES!]

[[/=]]

The spray of bullets was thick as they ricocheted everywhere.  Emily phased next to Umber and crouched down to pick him up.  &#34;Now?&#34; she asked.

&#34;Now? Oh... right!  Yes.  Now!&#34;

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/armory_14.png width=&#34;600px&#34;]]

Together, both Emily and Umber faced them head on.  Emily&#39;s form expanded to monstrous proportions, claws the size of scythes ready to harvest.  Umber flicked with his freehand and let fly three spears.  Though they were not the intimidating black spears he had wanted, the brightmatter was still a fair substitute.  They hummed chords in c major, sailing on dove wings toward their intended targets.  &#39;Disgusting&#39; Umber thought as his corrupted evocations flung down range.

The first and second spears hit one of them, piercing their heart right through the body armor.  Almost instantly, he was killed.  Another was slashed to ribbons by the terrible claws that came down on them.  The sickening squelch of bones separating from tissue were enough to leave to the imagination.  The one in the middle remained, and was the last.  Though he had a finger on the trigger the entire time, he had dislodged a canister and rolled it across the floor towards Emily.  

[[f&gt;image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/armory_15.png width=&#34;300px&#34;]]

[[=]]

++ PFFFSSSSSSSSS

[[/=]]

The top popped open and an opaque mist was ejected out, creating a thick cloud around her.  Almost instantly, it had a negative effect on her as she tried to bat it out of the way.  &#34;Ack!  No!  NO!&#34;

&#34;Emily?  Emily!&#34;  Umber raised his arm for another spear, but was quickly interrupted by gunfire.  Some bullets struck him in the chest, knocking him over.  He was alive thanks to the vest, but prone.  Ben rushed over to help its master, but it too was struck by gunfire.  The bullets however had little effect on Ben, being metal and all.  &#34;Ben, I&#39;m hurt but alright.  Help Emily.&#34;

Emily&#39;s protests were waning as her from shrank in size, even smaller when she was not swelled with rage.  &#34;Rad... irradiated gas... I... I can&#39;t...&#34; was all she could muster as the last, and presumably the leader, of Zeta-5 brought out an incorporeal entity vacuum chamber and forced the diminished Emily inside of it.  It sealed tightly with only Emily&#39;s bleeding eye visible.  Ben rushed over to the assailant, ready to ring.

&#34;Don&#39;t move!&#34;  The gun was pointed at Umber; its red laser dot centered right at his pupil.  Ben obliged to the request and backed off slowly.

&#34;Ben?  BEN!&#34;  Umber was frozen as well, it was a valiant fight but there were one too many.  Ben was bound to the protection of its master as his very meaning and existence depended on it.  Such are the limitations of a familiar.  For a good long while, the jailer pointed the laser at Umber&#39;s face till he stepped forward and retrieved the canister, and Emily with it.

[[=]]

[[f&lt;image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/armory_16.png width=&#34;400px&#34;]]


Umber wasn&#39;t going to wait to be shot in the face.  In a spurt of stupid bravery, he grabbed Ben by the point and rolled back down the aisles of the armory.  Five more shots rang out, but all missed.  The tucked bright ball tumbled into the stacked shelves of the armory and was quickly out of sight.  The jailer was just about to pursue, when his radio suddenly clicked on within an earshot of Umber and Ben.

[[=]]

[ZETA ONE, RETURN SCP-2996 TO H-WING FOR REPROCESSING.  WE HAVE OTHERS COMING TO RETRIEVE THE INSURGENT.]

[COPY, DIRECTOR]

[[/=]]

Back into the darkness and into the depths of the facility went Zeta One and Emily.  Her sad eye looking out through her acrylic cage before blinking out.  Umber cursed to himself.  

&#34;Shadjar!  We are complete and utter shadjar!  Why did you not help her Ben?&#34;

Ben dipped down in front of its master in shame.  It wanted to save Emily badly.  Umber relented and sighed.  &#34;I know.  I know.  Familiar bonds and all that.  Emily is not our mission.  But... ARGH!&#34;  He kicked a shelf in frustration.

There was no time to mope over the events.  He had to take action before the others the director spoke of came and put him in a cage as well.  Already the director was having more jailers close in on them in minutes or even seconds.

Umber hustled back over to the lockers where he put his stuff.  In it were the phone, the amulet of knife summoning, the security key card Emily was carrying, and Sage; who had not moved even an inch during the whole fiasco.  He took only the phone and Sage out of the locker and placed the green toad onto the cold floor.  Umber knew he could carry her if he were to pursue Emily, **and it was pretty clear that the &#34;no more than one familiar at a time&#34; rule was strict to casters**.

= &#34;Sage.  You can follow us.  However, we will travel quickly.  Or you can go back to the marshes.&#34;  

He looked over his shoulder and peered into the darkness where Emily was getting further and further away.  &#34;Up to you.  Ben, let&#39;s go.&#34;  And off he sprinted into the tunnel.  Down into the bowels of the facility to find where Zeta One was taking her.

Even though she was not part of the cult&#39;s mission, Umber had decided to make her a priority.  Like it or not, he was willing to face the consequences if it all turned sideways.  He had come to terms that his short life might be cut even shorter because of it.  Umber could see in the dark still and made out the faint glow from Emily&#39;s containment unit.  As it dimmed around the corner, Umber and Ben rushed after it.  His small legs nearly flying as he turned the corner.  There he was, Zeta One passing through a set of doors.  Above it read: &#34;FURNICULAR RAILWAY TO LAKE WINGS&#34;.

&#34;He&#39;s going under the lake?&#34;  Is what Umber said to himself as he closed in on them.  Umber and Ben squeezed through the sliding door just as it closed behind them.  Inside was a large chamber with a station platform and a steeply sloped railway that went down and east.  They were a bit late as Zeta One sat comfortably in the rail car as it was winched down under its own gravity.  Deeper and deeper into the dark they sank.  The headlights of the railcar did not even have enough light to see the bottom of where the rail ended, and soon after the taillights were swallowed up in darkness.

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/sublevel_7.PNG width=&#34;500px&#34;]]

Umber stood at the end of the rail next to the winch as the tension cable creaked and the ceiling dripped lake water into the tunnel.  If he had not been in such a hurry, he might have been impressed with the size of the underground portion of the facility.  **However, he had more pressing matters.**  

The lights of the railcar had already started to dim as it descended.  **Umber suddenly had an idea, though it was very risky.  Just as he punched a hole into the water treatment building, he could blast his way into the railcar.** He quickly thumbed through the book for dark tunneling and like before; he added the modifications for using light.  As soon as he finished the final incantation of the spell, there was a great burst of radiant energy.  Umber squeezed into a line of photons and aimed directly at the railcar.  From his perspective, there was a very rapid kaleidoscope of colors rushing by.  Most notably, there was a point when it all became very red.

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/sublevel_8.PNG width=&#34;500px&#34;]]

 After punching through to the other side of the railcar, Umber zipped another few hundred yards before finally puffing back into his regular form.  He then tumbled for a few more seconds on to the tracks and eventually stopped.  Luckily he was not all that harmed save for a few bumps.  Umber propped back up and looked behind him only to see the careening mass of steel and glass coming down the steep tunnel.  Apparently, he blasted through more than just brain matter and may have hit the control board in the front of the car that activates the remaining safety brakes.

[[f&gt;image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/sublevel_9.png width=&#34;500px&#34;]]

 Sparks and embers leaped onto the tracks like confetti as the rail car got closer.  The frame shook violently from the vibration caused by the brakes, but gravity had quite a hold of it and was determined to bring it all the way down.  It didn&#39;t take long for the last remnants of the brakes to melt as the railcar sped up.

 &#34;Second time today I am running for my life!&#34; Umber said as he made a bold sprint down the steep incline.  The growing brightness of the headlights and the screeching metal on metal wail were chasing him.  There was another snap that could be heard from the top.  It was the winch failing and finally snapping.  Now there was nothing between the front of an out of control railcar and a solid concrete barrier to slow its progress, except for a small homunculus.

 Umber was almost flying down the incline.  He was actually surprised at his speed, although tripping at this rate would be disastrous.  He concentrated hard at just keeping his feet in motion with his acceleration.  Still the railcar was gaining on him.  Below was the end of the line and the concrete barrier.  Umber would have to jump and clear it if he had any hope of living through this.  Four seconds from the bottom and the front of the steel box brushed his backside.  &#34;Ack!&#34; he yelped as he pushed himself faster and finally into a harrowing vault over the barrier.

++ CRASH!
[[/=]]

**Glass, steel, cable, spell book, concrete, cell phone, and homunculus all went up into the air in a loud burst of air and noise.**  Umber was in free fall for a good five to six seconds until the ground caught up to him.  He landed with a weighty thud and once again tumbled before stopping.  Shards of a glass and rubble rained on top of him but luckily nothing bigger than a marble.  His belongings were strewn across the floor and the ruckus down the tunnel was silenced for good.  The smoldering and crumpled railcar now looked like a dented beer can.  It lay snuggled against the cracked concrete barrier and was off its tracks.  For sure, it would be a good long while until the jailers could repair the railway.  It was totaled.

[[f&lt;image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/sublevel_11_1.png width=&#34;500px&#34;]]

 &#34;Uggghhh...&#34;  Umber groaned.

 Ben had been right behind him the whole way, but when you have a light speed head-start it is difficult to make any progress.  Umber was alive... technically.  His armored vest absorbed much of the forces during his tumble and he was in fair shape.  **Umber shakily propped up on his arms to collect himself and belongings.** He was now under the lake in the deepest darkest parts of the facility.

~~~~

**After picking up the phone and book that were flung from the railcar, he turned on the phone&#39;s flashlight and begun to search the inside of the crumpled mess.**  It was at this time Umber truly paid any attention to the phone&#39;s battery life since he got it, which held at a measly 36%.  He took a mental note of it as he stepped in through the broken door.  Up at the top of the incline, he could make out faint beams of flashlights.  Likely, it was the rest of the team coming for him.  Umber simply smiled, as he knew it&#39;d take them a good long while to get down onto his level without rail out of commission.

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/sublevel_12.png width=&#34;500px&#34;]] 

&#34;PSSST!  Emily?  Are you aliv- are you here?&#34;

There was a faint tapping on the glass on his left.  He jerked his head to find a bloody red eye looking back at him through the clear container.  Ben floated next to her to tap back.  &#34;Emily!  Excellent... now let&#39;s get you out.&#34;  Umber fumbled with the container for a few seconds before finally kicking it frustration.  &#34;Shadjar!&#34;

Emily squinted and then glared back at him.  &#34;Oh, right... sorry.&#34;

Ben panned side to side before gently tapping on a button on the side.  The glass cylinder popped open as the gas leached out and Emily expanded to full form.  &#34;uuuuuUUUUUUUUGGGGGGH!  That.  Was.  Awful.&#34;  She stretched out to fill the space and then compressed to a reasonable size.  Umber nodded dutifully.  &#34;Glad to have you back with us.&#34;

&#34;Good to be back... thank you, Umber.&#34;

&#34;You would have done the same, Emily&#34;

&#34;Still...&#34;  

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/sublevel_13.png width=&#34;400px&#34;]] 

Emily bent down and scooped Umber into a tender and appreciative hug.  Umber simply struggled, as this was most unbecoming of a serious cultist.  What would Ben think?  However, all Ben was thinking was the amount of time they were wasting.  After an indecent moment had passed, Ben decided to gently prod the couple and refocus.  &#34;Right!&#34;  Umber cleared his throat as he was let go.  All three of them then turned to the body of the now dead Zeta One.  As if knowing what each was thinking, they quickly converged onto the corpse.  Umber and Ben were searching for items that may be of use.  As they did, he felt something rectangular in the left vest pocket and pulled it free.  **It was a red-bordered badge that looked fairly important.**  Emily was however mutilating the face of Zeta One, making an even bloodier mess.

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/sublevel_14.png width=&#34;300px&#34;]] 

[[f&gt;image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/keycard4.png width=&#34;150px&#34;]] 

&#34;Er... Ok, I think we got something here.  His badge.  Emily, would you mind holding it?&#34;

Emily gave one last rake across the lacerated skull before taking it from Umber.  &#34;Gladly.  Ooooh, a red one.  Wonder what it opens.&#34;  Her bloodied claws did little to stain the already red badge.

&#34;No idea, but there&#39;s other stuff here too.&#34;

Umber also set aside **Zeta One&#39;s sidearm, his radio, a grenade, a large knife, and a set of keys.**  

He put them on the ground to rummage through if needed, but the more pressing issue was moving forward with the mission.  Sure enough, their next obstacle lay directly in front of the crashed railcar.  It was another large bulkhead door which blocked access to some of Site-81&#39;s most dangerous items, secrets, and who knows what else.  Distant chatter echoed down the incline to Umber, Emily, and Ben.  Just a reminder that they were still being pursued. 

~~~~

&#34;Grab the keys!&#34;  ordered Umber as Emily swooped them up in her claws.  Up ahead the large bulkhead peered out from the darkness as they disembarked the wrecked station.  Ben was first to reach the large steel slab, tapping it gently just to make sure it was indeed impassable.  Umber already started to work on it by the time he reached the controls.

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/sublevel_15.png width=&#34;500px&#34;]] 
~~~~

&#34;Ok, just like last time I believe.  Purple is for the locks, green is for the door... right?&#34;

Emily nodded in affirmation as she waited for Umber to perform the task.  Umber rubbed his stubby digits together and began the arduous task of turning the wheels.  With a slow click, the locks along the floor disengaged.  Then the green wheel was turned and there was a painful squeal of metal on metal as it began to move.  

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/sublevel_16.png width=&#34;500px&#34;]]

It was dark and the air had turned stale with the ventilation deactivated.  In the distance pipes groaned and water dripped from a crack in the ceiling.  Umber, Emily, and Ben all stepped into the engulfing darkness.  Now under the deep lake itself, they walked forward.  Umber&#39;s glow provided some relief from the blackness, enough to see the polished concrete floor and the occasional cockroach as it skittered across the floor.

&#34;Where are we going?&#34;  Umber asked to Emily who had seemingly taken point.

&#34;I&#39;m not wholly sure.  I remember this place only vaguely.  I know that it was further down but that is all.&#34;

&#34;Ok, lets just walk quietly-&#34;

&#34;HOWDY, SLICK!&#34; chirped a voice off to the side.  A wall mounted screen flickered on and Virgil&#39;s icon appeared, staring at all three of them.  Emily stopped in her tracks as Umber rushed ahead.  &#34;Virgil!  Be quiet!&#34;

Umber raised a hand as if to scold Virgil some more but he was interrupted by the sudden string of floor lights illuminating a path straight south from where they were.  Emily stepped ahead and looked back at Umber.  &#34;I can&#39;t be contained again... I just can&#39;t.  I&#39;d rather evaporate into nothingness.&#34;

He looked up at her.  &#34;Well being contained would really complicate the mission.&#34;  Ben bobbed up and down in agreement.  The only visible path diverged south but there were doors and other hallways along the way.  **Umber then took a moment to mull over his options**.
