    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Full Name:** James &#39;Coffee Boy&#39; Shebleha

**Security Clearance:** Level-1

**Occupation:** Junior Research Assistant.

**Site Location:** Site-██

**Security Warning:** Shebleha is still considered to be a possible informant to the &#39;Church of the Broken God&#39;. He is to be closely monitored and any possible security leaks are to be reported to Head Security Officer ███████████.

**History:** James Shebleha began working for The Foundation on ██/██/████ after he was given sanctuary from The Church of the Broken God. Shebleha contacted The Foundation with information about CotBG safe houses as well as the location of SCP-███ that had been taken from Site-██ by the CotBG on [REDACTED]. Sanctuary was granted upon successful retrieval of SCP-███, at which point Shebleha was taken to Site-██ after he was screened for possible biological contaminants. During Shebleha&#39;s stay at Site-██ he was closely monitored as a possible informant for the CotBG; however, he has shown no indication of contacting anyone outside of The Foundation. For security reasons Shebleha is not authorised to enter Site-██ due to [[[SCP-882]]] being located there. Shebleha was eventually allowed to work as a Junior Research Assistant on low-priority SCPs. However, he is still being monitored as a possible informant.

Shebleha stated during his initial interrogation that: &#34;//I thought that the Church of the Broken God had the right idea, but after spending time with them I realised that they are just crazy zealots. At that point I realised that I needed to get out as soon as possible before they killed me for &#39;not believing in their God.&#39; Naturally the Foundation was well known by the Church of the Broken God, as they called you &#39;heretics&#39;, but looking past all their religious [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] I saw that what the Foundation was doing was right, by containing these things that you designate SCPs you keep humanity alive and stop the world falling in chaos.//&#34;

During Shebleha&#39;s time in The Foundation, he has come up with what have been described as &#39;crack-pot SCP theories&#39;. Some are as follows:

[[collapsible show=&#34;Concerning SCP-682&#34; hide=&#34; ... &#34;]]

&gt; //Okay, it&#39;s like this. That bloody lizard refuses to die because he doesn&#39;t physically exist. Now don&#39;t get me wrong, he exists but he&#39;s a non-corporeal entity that feeds off our hatred for ourselves. That&#39;s why he can&#39;t die. Because we will always hate ourselves and no this isn&#39;t me saying that if we started being all kind to each other and ourselves he&#39;ll just go away... Although I could always see if I could show him some My Little [REDACTED]: ██████████ is [DATA EXPUNGED].//

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;Concerning SCP-055&#34; hide=&#34; ... &#34;]]

(The following &#39;theory&#39; was pieced together over several months due to the nature of [[[SCP-055]]].)

&gt; //Okay, you know 055 right? Well... erm...//
&gt; //You see, 055 makes you forget what it... does...//
&gt; //Well my theory goes like this: 055 doesn&#39;t actually make you... forget...//
&gt; //’cus if it made you forget the things that it was then... something or other.//
&gt; //It would make you forget that it makes you forget... things...//
