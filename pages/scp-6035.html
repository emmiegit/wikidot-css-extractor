**Item #:** SCP-6035

**Object Class:** --Safe-- Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6035 is currently secured in a standard high-value storage locker at [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facilities-locations Site 73]. To prevent possible reactivation of its anomalous properties, it may not be removed from its current location without permission from the Site Director. 

**Description:** SCP-6035 is a vinyl LP of the 1980 album //Is This Real?// by the punk rock band Wipers. When not activated, SCP-6035 is identical to non-anomalous vinyl records of the same album. 

SCP-6035’s anomalous properties manifested when it was placed on any working turntable or other device that is intended for the use of vinyl records. When the first song, titled //Return of the Rat//, was played, two large anthropomorphic entities resembling common brown rats (//Rattus norvegicus//) and carrying electric guitars manifested in the immediate vicinity of SCP-6035. These entities (designated SCP-6035-A and SCP-6035-B) would then proceed to act out the lyrics of the song in a mostly literal manner, and had elongated human-like arms and legs for this purpose. The subject who activated the record would be periodically interacted with as the song progressed. 

Once //Return of the Rat// concluded, the entities de-manifested and the rest of the record could be played with no anomalous effects. 

**Sample SCP-6035 Test:**

__Test Subject:__ D-53995. Subject is instructed to place SCP-6035 on the testing turntable, play the record, and observe the results. 

||**Song Timestamp**||**SCP-6035-A and -B Actions**||**Lyrical Equivalent**||
||0:00-0:10||SCP-6035-A appears within the testing room and begins playing its guitar at 0:05.||Opening instrumental.||
||0:10-0:20||SCP-6035-A stops playing its guitar and a map of the United States appears in its hand. SCP-6035-A scrutinizes the map closely before showing it to D-53995 and pointing at it excitedly.||Corresponds to lyrics urging the listener to stay alert and remain aware due to unspecified persons arriving from throughout the country.||
||0:20-0:44||SCP-6035-A vocalizes the chorus and continues to play its guitar. These are the only words spoken by SCP-6035-A and SCP-6035-B throughout the manifestation event.||Eponymous chorus and instrumental.||
||0:45-0:54||SCP-6035-B manifests, carrying a Bible and wearing the attire of a Catholic priest. It then proceeds to beat D-53995 over the head with the Bible for several seconds before pointing its finger at her in an accusatory manner.||Corresponds to lyrics in which the singer urges unnamed persons to “confess” to an unspecified action.||
||0:55-1:50||As the chorus and guitar solo begin, SCP-6035-B discards its Bible and an electric guitar appears in its hands. SCP-6035-A and SCP-6035-B then vocalize the chorus before reproducing the guitar solo from the song.||Chorus, guitar solo.||
||1:51-2:00||SCP-6035-A and SCP-6035-B appear on either side of D-53995 and grab her shoulders while pointing around the testing chamber in an agitated manner.||Corresponds to lyrics identical to the verse from 0:10-0:20, but with an unspecified “room” referenced in place of a country.||
||2:01-2:37||SCP-6035-A and SCP-6035-B vocalize the chorus and play the instrumental that concludes the song. Following the end of the track, they both take a short bow and immediately de-manifest before the next song (//Mystery//) plays.||Chorus, closing instrumental.||

**Addendum 6035.A: Accidental Neutralization of SCP-6035:** On 22 Oct 2019, SCP-6035 was accidentally neutralized during regular testing. 

Following the conclusion of a standard test, researchers instructed the test subject (D-46924) to remove SCP-6035 from the testing turntable and immediately replace it with a non-anomalous vinyl of //Eight Songs for Greg Sage and The Wipers//, a 1992 tribute album consisting of covers of various Wipers songs. Following the conclusion of the third song on the album, a cover of //Return of the Rat// by the grunge band Nirvana, SCP-6035-A and SCP-6035-B[[footnote]]Neither could be distinctly identified due to their identical physical features and atypical actions.[[/footnote]] manifested in the testing chamber. One was wearing a Nirvana-themed shirt and the other a shirt which mimicked the cover art for //Is This Real?// Both entities then made loud screeching vocalizations at one another in an apparently argumentative manner for the next five minutes.

At the conclusion of the argument, the SCP-6035-A/B instance wearing the Nirvana shirt picked up SCP-6035 and threw it against the testing chamber wall. Both instances then slowly walked towards the opposite end of the testing chamber before de-manifesting. Following this event, SCP-6035 displayed no anomalous properties in its subsequent activations; SCP-6035-A and SCP-6035-B have not appeared since the aforementioned test. SCP-6035 has been reclassified as Neutralized.
