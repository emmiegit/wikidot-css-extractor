**Item #:** SCP-1983-JP

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Automatic containment method 71-Aburi (Urban Anomalous Structure Quarantine Containment) is being performed on the SCP-1983-JP entity. Please check for anomalies in the information of containment closure and lockdown routines in accordance with Document 1983/Rimendam.

Due to the nature of the object, the document on SCP-1983-JP was automatically generated by the Aburi-algorithm. All records regarding SCP-1983-JP are under the management of the Meme Auto Security System, protected by the SH Disinterest/Unpleasantries Inducement Meme Agent, in addition to standard security measures.

Recognition of SCP-1983-JP’s contents is prohibited. The documents are locked and staff, regardless of clearance or power, is generally prohibited from browsing them. Browsing by any intelligent being requires the usage of a particular protection counter-agent.

**Any intelligent being accessing this document will be exposed and irreversibly infected by Type IV Antimemetic content.[[footnote]]Type IV antimemes induce short-term anterograde amnesia on the target, making it impossible for the target to consciously perceive the object.[[/footnote]]** If you are an intelligent being possessing no countermeasures, quickly stop browsing and contact an HMCL supervisor. The visitor will be dealt with immediately.

**Description:** SCP-1983-JP is a Type IV Anti-memetic infestation with unknown threshold occurring in the house and associate plot located in [REDACTED]. The infestation is irreversible, with attempts at restoration having failed. The anomaly was discovered in 2011.

Regarding SCP-1983-JP and related items, humans and other intelligent beings unconsciously avoid observing the item. As a result, SCP-1983-JP cannot be perceived unless strongly aware of it.

Furthermore, SCP-1983-JP causes irreversible short-term anterograde amnesia, making it impossible for intelligent beings to consciously remember the item for long periods of time. Thus, the containment team decided to machine-generate SCP-1983-JP’s document using the Aburi-algorithm.

No intelligent being can enter SCP-1983-JP’s area. Contact with any item inside SCP-1983-JP is not possible. For this reason, during initial containment, the automatic survey system dispatched a small drone to conduct an internal inspection.

The house is a two-storied building made of wood, and the total land area, including the house and plot land, is of 13m x 21m. Records show SCP-1983-JP was built in 1996. The internal inspection of the house shows that a Japanese married couple in their 30s, along with their son most likely lived inside. However, they are not currently present within SCP-1983-JP.

No information regarding the people who lived within SCP-1983-JP exists, neither inside the residence, nor within the surrounding community, and all attempts to track them have failed. The fact that records exist that SCP-1983-JP was built by a resident shows that, currently, the residents have disappeared for some unknown reason.

**Interior Record:**
&gt; Drone exploration was conducted by the automatic survey system in 2011. The drone flew inside the house with the help of automatic guidance, and all observation contents were analyzed by the Aburi-algorithm and sequentially converted into text.

The drone first investigated the house’s perimeter. A car is parked in front of the entrance, and a thin layer of snow has piled up on the yard to the left. No particular anomalies observed. All the windows of the house are thoroughly polished. The rear storehouse contained general household items such as tools, sport equipment and bicycles.

The toilet window is open. The drone enters the first floor through there, moving towards the entrance. On the floor, shoes believed to belong to an adult male, an adult female, and a young child are carefully arranged. No particular anomalies observed. The drone moves past the entrance, into the living room. It must be noted that on the LCD television in the living room, the NHK education 15-minutes programme “Today’s Health” plays repeatedly.

The kitchen is investigated. As all objects cannot be interacted with, the contents of drawers and the fridge cannot be verified. On top of the dishwasher, three glasses, some tableware, and a set of teacups are resting, drying. No signs of decomposing fruits or vegetables are left. It must be noted that, despite SCP-1983-JP having been discovered several months before, the interior of the house has remained well cleaned.

An attempt to enter the upstairs space produced a strong external force, and moving into the second floor was not possible. The house is crying. The drone turns back the way it came. After passing a large, empty space, the drone impacted an invisible object as it moved outside. Attempts to inspect the object’s shape have failed. The drone attempts to access the second floor through a window. The house’s windows have been thoroughly cleaned, down to their frames.

The drone enters the second floor’s hallway. To the left is a watercolor painting of a sailing ship with a decorated picture frame. There are three doors to the right. Exploration continues in the nearest room.

The first room is believed to be a woman’s room. The inside of the room is in order, with clothes carefully folded and stacked up in chests. The bookshelf have empty aisles, and appear to be decorated with journey articles without much consistency. Some books show signs of relative fatigue, but other than that, no particular anomalies are observed. However, no futon, bed, or any object that shows human habitation were present. I don’t know the reason why.

After passing a pure-white corridor, they enter the second room. The fluorescent lights on the ceiling have been left on. The room appears to be a man’s room. There is a computer on the desk, surrounded by piles of books and documents. The house is crying. On the desk there is a photograph of three family members: A couple and their son. The sea in the background is beautiful, with a distinctive vast blue sky covering the scene. This room has no bedding or electric lights, so how the hell did the inhabitants live their lives?

The house is crying. There are no family members in the photograph. Past the empty space, the drone enters the third room. This is that child’s room. It’s warm. The room is carpeted, and the wallpaper has bright pastel colors. On the desk there is a Nintendo DS and many erasers collected by that child. In a rectangular container in the corner of the room there are toy swords, lego blocks, Transformers toys, and a Sylvanian Families dollhouse. Many toys are inside. These are the toys the kid has been playing with all his life. But there is nothing in the toy box anymore. The empty room’s floor is too cold, and the walls have become pure-white.

The house is crying. No family lived in this house. The basketball that child liked does not exist, and neither do the teacups they shared together. I don’t know the reason why. There is no compact car to bring everyone. Where was that child going to every morning? I don’t know.

The drone flies over a snow field. SCP-1983-JP does not exist. The house is not there anymore. The house is still crying.
