= **SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES** 

------

SCP-7945-A instances shall be kept within a specialized animal containment unit situated at Site-39, confined within an empty glass container with a minimum dimension of 30 x 30 x 30 cm. 

[[include component:image-block name=Gecko.jpg|width=250px|caption= SCP-7945-1 (A)
]]

The container must be fitted with an airtight lid, supplying a constant stream of oxygen via a fine mesh. The glass container shall be situated within an equally hermetic chamber, equipped with passive infrared sensors (PIR) distributed throughout the ceiling, walls, and floor. 

Containment procedures for SCP-7945 are to be executed with emphasis placed on preventing instances from reproducing.  The containment chamber shall maintain a constant temperature of 65°F. In the event of any reproduction, any offspring, designated SCP-7945-1 (B) (or SCP-7945-B) must be terminated and incinerated immediately. The maximum number of SCP-7945-A instances allowed under Site-39 containment is strictly limited to four (4) at any given time.

Containment of SCP-7945-1 instances are to be monitored by no less than personnel, which must undergo a monthly examination by a memetic/psychologic expert. The personnel must be rotated with other 5 personnel.

= **DESCRIPTION**

------

SCP-7945 is an anomalous subspecies of gecko that closely resembles //Lepidodactylus lugubris//, commonly known as the Mourning gecko. SCP-7945 instances and their clones display typical behavior for their non-anomalous counterparts, therefore, SCP-7945 reproduces through parthenogenesis [[footnote]]  Reproductive strategy that involves development of a female (rarely a male) gamete (sex cell) without fertilization [[/footnote]]. The reproductive activity of SCP-7945 is, however, significantly higher.

Notably, organisms which come into contact with SCP-7945 are subject to a metamorphosis that results in an imprecise replica of the anomaly (see test logs) due to SCP-7945-3 [RECLASSIFIED INFORMATION] [[footnote]] see addendum 01 with proper credentials[[/footnote]]. The process may produce malformed mutations, denominated SCP-7945-2. Experiments indicate that animal organisms display a higher success rate in transforming into SCP-7945 instances than members of other kingdoms.

&gt; = **The restant data, specially the one pertaining SCP-7945-3 is classified, please, access Addendum 01 with proper credentials.**


------

= **DISCOVERY ADDENDUM**

------

SCP-7945 was first identified in 1987 on the island of Tokunaga, following reports of a radical increase in the Lepidodactylus Lugubris population by local field biologists. 

A collaborative investigation between the Department of Fish and Wildlife and the University of Maui confirmed the reports, and the incident was covered in scientific publications such as National Geographic. Not only that, but private individuals reported unusual events related to SCP-7945. This garnered the attention of the Foundation, which dispatched a team of agents to interview as many whitnesses as possible.

Following log is from an interview performed by Agt. Meyster Smiles, disguised as a psychologist, with Johnathan Whilestone. 

&gt; ------
&gt; = **Video log**
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; = **&lt;Start of log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Smiles:** Good day, Mr. Whilestone. I&#39;m Dr. Smiles, your psychologist. (//extends his hand for a handshake//) I understand from our records that you&#39;ve been under a lot of stress. Is that correct?
&gt; 
&gt; **Johnathan whilestone:**  (//shakes Dr. Smiles&#39; hand//) Yes, that&#39;s accurate.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Smiles:** Thank you. Could you please share with me how your sleep has been over the past week?
&gt; 
&gt; **Johnathan Whilestone:** My sleep has been pretty irregular. I&#39;ve been staying up most nights, either wandering around my apartment, reading, or just rummaging through my fridge.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Smiles:** (takes notes) Ok, and, just to clarify, you have managed to sleep, but it&#39;s been disturbed?
&gt; 
&gt; **Johnathan Whilestone:** (nods) Yes, exactly. The sleep I&#39;ve had has mostly been plagued by nightmares that leave me feeling drained when I wake up.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Smiles:** (//scribbles in his notebook//) Could you elaborate on these nightmares?
&gt; 
&gt; **Johnathan Whilestone:** (//Hesitates and gazes at his left//) Um.... there&#39;s this huge crowd of people, I can usually make out several of my friends&#39; faces, and it&#39;s hot. I&#39;m there, standing in the middle. Then... uh, they transform into monsters... into horrifying monsters, then... then they start chasing me, screaming (//shakes nervously//) and... and, they want me to come to them, to...to turn me into one of them... &#34;Become me, become me,&#34; they all scream behind me, as I run, then I fall from a cliff and wake up, sweating. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Smiles:** (//coughs softly//) Have you shared these nightmares with anyone, perhaps a partner?
&gt; 
&gt; **Johnathan Whilestone:** Oh, no, I&#39;m actually single... I mean, pretty much alone at home, except for when my friends come over to have a drink and spend the night... Besides, no... I mean, I told no one
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Smiles:** (//nods//)  I see. Given our conversation and your family&#39;s wealth, it appears your anxiety levels are quite elevated. Anxiety often arises from experiences like loss, abuse, or work-related stress.
&gt; 
&gt; **Johnathan Whilestone:** (//Looks confused//) Wait, how do you know about it, about my family&#39;s wealth? I never stated it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Smiles:** (//Scratches his chin//) Oh... uh...  (nods, leaning back) Well, there&#39;s someone from your family who&#39;s a regular patient of mine. However, I can&#39;t reveal their identity due to confidentiality. But yes, it&#39;s a similar pattern, and it often requires a certain level of financial stability to seek my services.
&gt; 
&gt; **Johnathan Whilestone:** Ok, fair enough then
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Smiles:**  (leaning forward) Considering your anxiety and lifestyle, have you gone through any significant events that might contribute to these feelings? Your interactions with friends, for example, could be indicative of something serious.
&gt; 
&gt; //Whilestone stares at the desk in silence//
&gt; 
&gt; **Johnathan Whilestone:** (//pauses, gazing at the desk before meeting Dr. Smiles&#39; eyes//) Well, you remember those nightmares I mentioned earlier?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Smiles:** Yes, what about them?
&gt; 
&gt; **Johnathan Whilestone:** (hesitates) This might sound strange, but those nightmares… they&#39;re not just nightmares. They actually happened.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Smiles:** (surprised) I&#39;m sorry, do you mean they happened in reality?
&gt; 
&gt; **Johnathan Whilestone:** (//distant//) Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Smiles:** Could you please explain?
&gt; 
&gt; **Johnathan Whilestone:**  Uh... yes, A few months ago, my brother Peter and I were sailing near Toku Island in Hawaii on his yacht. We&#39;re both into camping, so we decided to spend a night there. He always had tents on the yacht for our summer sailing trips.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Smiles:**  (interested) What happened during your stay on the island?
&gt; 
&gt; **Johnathan Whilestone:** We set up camp, had some drinks from the yacht, and went to sleep… Then... (//begins tapping on the table and speaks with trembling voice//) I woke up in the middle of the night by a scream... 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Smiles:** A scream? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Johnathan Whilestone:** (//shakes//) Yes... My brother... I dunno, I just dunno what happened with him, but he... I looked over to him and... he was convulsing on the floor, screaming and kicking around with his feet...
&gt; 
&gt; (//Agt. Smiles takes notes and gets his chair closer to Whilestone, who is shaking and close to cry//)  
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Smiles:** Don&#39;t worry, take your time.
&gt; 
&gt; **Johnathan Whilestone:** (//sobs for some minutes and continues//) He... his body changed... it inflated like a ballon, and his (//does a grimace//)... his skin went off with a  (//crunch sound//) and he... like some banana!
&gt; 
&gt; (//Agt. Smiles nods//) 
&gt; 
&gt; **Johnathan Whilestone:** (voice trembling) I was terrified. I tried to help him, to calm him down, but when he turned around.... his face was distorted, like a zombie. He started chasing me, just like in my nightmares, screaming and reaching out for me. I ran back to the yacht, locked myself in, but he kept pounding on the windows, trying to get to me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Smiles:** Oh, my God, I can only imagine how traumatic that experience must have been for you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Johnathan Whilestone:** (teary-eyed) It was beyond anything I could have imagined.... But  wait, you... you believe me? You probably think I&#39;m insane...
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Smiles:** It doesn&#39;t matter, I am here to help, not to judge you , but I need you to tell me what happened. Besides, the only one to decide if you&#39;re insane or not is me; it&#39;s my job, you paid me for it. (//softly//) You mentioned earlier that you told no one about this. Why did you keep it a secret?
&gt; 
&gt; **Johnathan Whilestone:**  (//voice quivering//) I didn&#39;t know how to explain it to anyone. How could I tell them that my brother turned into a... a monster? I was terrified they would think I was crazy.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Smiles:** (gentle) It&#39;s not uncommon for people to keep such experiences to themselves, especially when they fear others might not understand. You&#39;re not alone in feeling that way. Thank you for sharing that with me. It&#39;s important to acknowledge these feelings and experiences. Now, regarding what happened after you returned to the yacht…
&gt; 
&gt; **Johnathan Whilestone:**  (sniffs and takes a tissue from Dr. Smiles) I was trapped in the cabin while he was outside, still trying to get to me. I was so scared and desperate, and I knew I had to do something.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Smiles:** (nodding) What did you do?
&gt; 
&gt; **Johnathan Whilestone:** (//sniffs with voice breaking//) I found an axe in the yacht&#39;s storage. I had no other choice. I went back out and… I decapitated him. It was horrifying, but I had to do it to survive.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Smiles:** (nodding) You did what you had to do in an extremely difficult and traumatic situation. You were in danger, and your actions were a form of self-defense.
&gt; 
&gt; **Johnathan Whilestone:** (emotionally overwhelmed) I&#39;ve been carrying this weight, this guilt... I lied to our family and friends about what happened. I&#39;ve felt so isolated and lost ever since.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Smiles:** (gentle) It&#39;s understandable that you would feel overwhelmed. What you&#39;ve experienced is not something anyone should have to go through alone.
&gt; 
&gt; **Johnathan Whilesotne:** Wait, hold on, I don&#39;t buy this, do you really believe me?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Smiles:** (//fills a glass with water from a plastic bottle and reaches it to him//) As I mentioned earlier, whether I believe you or not is not the focus here. My role is to help you navigate these emotions and experiences, regardless of their origin. You&#39;ve been through a lot, and it&#39;s important to address your feelings, regardless of how unusual they may seem.
&gt; 
&gt; **Johnathan Whilestone:** (teary-eyed) Thank you. I&#39;ve been carrying this burden for so long, and I didn&#39;t know where to turn.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Smiles:** (supportively claps on Mr. Whilestone&#39;s shoulder) You&#39;re not alone in this journey. I&#39;m here to support you, and we&#39;ll work together to find ways to cope with what you&#39;ve been through. It&#39;s okay to ask for help when you need it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Johnathan Whilestone:** You sure this won&#39;t get me in trouble? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Smiles:** Of course! 
&gt;

Upon reviewing the results, the Foundation decided to send agents to Tokunaga. Following log is a conversation via radio between the leader of the team, Sgt. Erdinger Zola, and  the team of researchers monitoring the operation.

&gt; = **Equipment Recording Log 742**

&gt; **DATE: 13/9/1979**
&gt; 
&gt; Duration of the audio recording: 53 min, 33 sec
&gt; 
&gt; = **&lt;Start log&gt;** 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Zola:** (//audible sea noises//) We&#39;ve arrived, and are waiting for orders
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Loaf:** Ok, dispatch your men and reconnoiter the island, but exercise caution. We don&#39;t fully comprehend the nature of the anomaly yet. What we do know is that it&#39;s not safe to handle, so under no circumstances should you touch any specimens you find. Use the tweezers we provided.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Zola:** Copy. Alright, listen up, gentlemen. Arm yourselves and familiarize yourselves with the island layout. We&#39;ll divide into pairs: Wexler and Greg, head west; Paul and Cook, take the eastern path. Pedro, you&#39;re with me to the north, toward the mountain. Everyone has GPS units in their pockets. Remember, if you encounter any specimens, take them. No one boards the boat without my signal, understood?
&gt; 
&gt; **Greg:** But we are allowed to have a tea pause, don&#39;t we?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Zola:** Greg, save the jokes for later. Pack them in your bag and leave them there. Understood, everyone else?
&gt; 
&gt; (//Audible affirmations from the team//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Wexler:** How do we ID anomalous stuff? The pics don&#39;t scream &#39;weird&#39;. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Zola:** Everything we find, we bring it back. Let the eggheads figure it out. We&#39;re the muscle and they&#39;re the brains. OK, men, have luck and watch out for critters.
&gt; 
&gt; (//following 20 min omitted//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Loaf:** Dr. Loaf here. Any remarkable discoveries, Sgt. Zola?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Zola:** Not much yet. We&#39;ve only collected two specimens. They&#39;re elusive, and when we do find them, they vanish into thin air, slippery little bastards.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Loaf:** I understand the challenge. I used to chase after wall lizards as a kid in Florida. Catching them was a rarity.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Zola:** (Steps stop) Wait, see that? Oh my...
&gt; 
&gt; **Pedro:** I&#39;ll take a pic
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Zola:** Yeah, we&#39;ll send it to the center
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Loaf:** Zola, what&#39;s going on? Describe what you&#39;ve found.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Zola:** We stumbled upon a bizarre corpse in the middle of the forest. It looks like a dinosaur.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Loaf:** Hum, It seems like the whitnesses were right, what does it look like, besides &#34;like a dinosaur&#34;?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Zola:** Uuh... It&#39;s like a messed up lizard, a mix between a lizard and a... lemme see... (//Pedro in the background: &#34;a pig&#34;//) Yeah, a pig.
&gt; 
&gt; **Pedro:** Pigasaur, maybe?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Zola:** Pedro, you should work in the Designations Department. That&#39;s a creative suggestion. Heard that, Doc? Should we designate it like that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Loaf:** Focus, guys, do not touch it, keep walking. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Zola:** (//laughs//) Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m just teasing, come Pedro.
&gt; 
&gt; (//following 10 min of walking among similar corpses cut for brevity//) 
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Zola:** Not much new, doc. More of those pigasaur corpses. Some are bigger. Woah, there&#39;s a good amount of lizards here... (//audible, intense crunch//) Damn it! Watch out, Pedro!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Loaf:** Zola? What was that? Zola? Are you ok?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Zola:** (//more crunches//) Yes, It&#39;s just the fucking trees, they&#39;re all, l... fuck, how will I explain it? They&#39;re transforming!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Loaf:** Transforming? Can you elaborate? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Zola:** (multiple audible crunches) What I&#39;m telling you, transforming, changing Into... I dunno, they&#39;re sorta molting, getting scales and growing tails. They&#39;re falling on us, so it&#39;s hard to walk around... what&#39;s the deal with lizards today? (audible crunch) Is that what happens when you touch them?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Loaf:** Yes, don&#39;t touch any of them. It seems they have a property that induces transformation. If trees are affected, the range could be more visible from above.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Zola:** Looks amazing, but I&#39;m not up for a lizard makeover. I&#39;ll be cautious.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Loaf:**  Good, but I need you to get to a vantage point and observe the affected area.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Zola:** Alright, we&#39;re en route towards the mountain.
&gt; 
&gt; (Following minutes cut or brevity)
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Zola:** Oh shi- Doctor, It&#39;s swarming with those lizards, I wish you were here to see how they pile up...
&gt; 
&gt; **Pedro:**  And the trees have vanished. Only huge corpses as far as we can see.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Zola:** Watch out, Pedro! (audible crunch) Damn, it&#39;s relentless! There&#39;s more trees falling! (//audible running//) We can&#39;t linger! They&#39;re raining down! (//audible rattle//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Loaf:** Shit, Get your men out of there as soon as possible! Make sure you don&#39;t lose the specimens!
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Zola:** Copy... (//audible screams, rattle//) Gosh, the trees, everything, there&#39;s so many fucking lizards! Zola here, everyone on the boat, now or be left behind!

Despite inconveniences, all agents sent to Tokunaga returned unharmed to the facility, although some of them had suffered minor injuries. The agents reported the island to be overrun with SCP-7945 instances upon their leave. Dr. Loaf resolved to incinerate the island, as the anomaly showed no signs of self-neutralization [[footnote]] This is based on its often cannibalistic and parthogenetic traits [[/footnote]]. To avoid public backlash, the RAISA [[footnote]] Record and Information Security Administration [[/footnote]] disseminated misleading information through the media, citing high radiation levels linked to the abandoned government facility on the island as the cause for its closure. 

A team of RAISA data recovery personnel utilized web crawlers to investigate the abandoned facility on Tokunaga for any information pertaining to SCP-7945&#39;s origins. The search proved fruitful; SCP-7945 resulted from scientific collaboration between the US government and an enterprise known as the O.F.I.[[footnote]] Omnipotent Force Incorporated is an enterprise known for leading the illegal anomalous weapon market in sales[[/footnote]] Below, there is a summarized version of the information gathered by the data recovery team assigned to SCP-7945.

&gt; ------
&gt; =  **Project Midas**
&gt; ------
&gt; = //By Micheline Bougier, RAISA interdepartmental communications//
&gt; 
&gt; In 1970, during the Cold war, US President Richard Nixon sponsored a project of military nature developed by the OFI. It involved developing an innovative biological weapon to use in the Vietnam war, with initial hopes of defeating Viet Cong.
&gt; 
&gt; The project, led by Dr. Niklas Olsson, was supposed to act stealthily and quietly, leaving no traces that would lead to the US or its allies. Instead, the weapon would take advantage of the Viet Cong&#39;s soldiers&#39; superstition.
&gt; 
&gt; According to data retrieved from Area-79, in Tokunaga, the development&#39;s goal involved altering the genes of a small animal so that it would produce cancer cells whose genes would be replicated on a human being&#39;s DNA. To achieve this, the specimen needed to come into physical contact with the victim&#39;s epidermis [[footnote]] The outer layer of the human skin [[/footnote]]. 
&gt; 
&gt; The chosen species was the //Lepidodactylus lugubris//, also known as the //Mourning gecko//, for the rapidness of its procreation, size, and its capability to adapt to tropical environments. The proceeding of Project Midas has however been redacted from every archive accessible to the RAISA&#39;s web crawlers, presumably by the OFI. --, therefore, it is unknown how the weapon was developed. As to this date, the RAISA&#39;s search continues.-- 
&gt; 
&gt; The development of Project Midas progressed with success, but was interrupted due to concerns arisen amongst both the sponsors and the developers. In a letter found by our web crawlers, President Nixon expressed his concern regarding the weapon becoming a statal threat in case it found its way into the US. This is assumed to be the cause of the research closure, though it is believed with enough evidence that Nixon had with plans to relocate it. However, the contract with the OFI expired due to the end of Nixon&#39;s presidential time, so Area-79 was abandoned and the OFI&#39;s team was relocated.
&gt; 
&gt; Based on inventory reports, it is believed that the OFI&#39;s operatives brought some SCP-7945-1 instances with them while leaving the facility, presumably in an attempt to sell them and develop them further. As to why some SCP-7945 instances remained in the facility, it is believed that a small amount of instances had breached their containment while being transferred; The SCP-7945-1 instances then silently multiplied in the abandoned facility until they found their way out into the Tokunaga jungle.

__Concerns about test subject discovery__
@@ @@
Dear Director Díaz,

@@ @@
I pray you take the time to read the following subject, which is of high concern to me. To clarify, I  parttook in the tests with SCP-7945-B instances on humans. What I observed in the subjects through the entire span of the tests is, in essence, the cause of my concern. The subjects, as soon as they underwent SCP-7945&#39;s anomalous effects, shrieked in obvious agonizing manner. I noticed how these shrieks, which lasted until the end of their metamorphosis, evolved from painful to approaching rage.
@@ @@
I understand that I, by saying this, might be etiquetted as paranoic and unprofessional. I however assure you, after having seen and heard all kinds of different things in my years of scientific research, that I have never heard shrieks quite similar as these. One could argue that the subjects&#39; minds were long from sanity, making them behave as brute animals, as they uncoordinately striked the glass separating us from them. 
@@ @@
Ater a week I could not avoid thinking about the shrieks from the subjects before their immediate termination. They appeared in my dreams, they unpredictably assaulted me when everything was silent, and I could notice they were saying things. They were talking, yes, talking. Every night, those shrieks and cries would become clearer and evolve into articulated sentences. I don&#39;t remember what they said, It&#39;s thypical with dreams; someone says something and you don&#39;t remember a single word, only a rumor of distant talking.
@@ @@
To calm myself down, I accessed the audio archives from the testing phase, to convince myself that this all was only a product of stress. However, I noticed that I could hear the sentences, that is, without understanding them. I therefore slowed the audio down and, between shrieks and cries, I could discern the following sentences: &#34;Let me make you me&#34;, &#34;I am all&#34;
@@ @@
This discovery made me want to study the SCP-7945-1 instances further, in an attempt to understand the reason behind this particular behavior. I therefore request, Director, permission to continue further investigation on SCP-7945-2 instances under my direction, with access to all necessary resources and relevant information. I am aware, sir, that the instances repeating these sentences may not be enough evidence to cause a significant amount of concern, but, risking to be repetitive and revindicative, I have seen many things in my years of research and learned that  nothing should be taken casually in this kind of matters.

Director Díaz approved the research proposed by Dr. Pignon and agreed to provide him with all requested resources. Dr. Pignon&#39;s research directive, however, ended after the incident as appelled below.

&gt; = **INCIDENT REPORT**
&gt; ----
&gt; **INCIDENT #:** 7945-2
&gt; **DATE OF OCCURRENCE:** 1987/9/21
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; At 16:30, the alarms to Unit 4 went off, indicating movement inside of the chamber where SCP-7945-A&#39;s container was located. All the adjacent entrances, ventilation systems and others were sealed, as programmed following the on-site SMPA [[footnote]] Security Measures and Protocols Archive [[/footnote]]. When security personnel arrived to Unit 4, they found SCP-7945-A&#39;s container open, and an SCP-7945-1 instance roaming the Containment Chamber where the latter was stored. 
&gt; 
&gt; The instance attacked the security guards on sight. The guards were ordered to terminate the SCP-7945-1 instance and inspect it and the chamber. They found, scattered clothing pieces around the chamber, in which they found a personnel ID card belonging to Dr. André Pignon.
&gt;
&gt; Reviewed security recordings showed Dr. Pignon using his level 3 clearance card to hastily open the door to SCP-7945-A&#39;s containment chamber. He entered the chamber, triggering the alarms and proceeded to stand on his knees, placing an SCP-7945 instance on his head.

The foremenioned incident happened simultanously what was considered the time when Dr. Pignon stopped writing last log. Next up, the following incident occurred soon after Dr. Pignon&#39;s demise.


&gt; = **INCIDENT REPORT**
&gt; ----
&gt; **INCIDENT #:** 7945-6
&gt; **DATE OF OCCURRENCE:** 1987/9/10
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** This incident report has been organized into distinct stages to provide comprehensive details.
&gt; 
&gt; **Stage 1**: On November 10th, at approximately 16:45, a series of violent incidents erupted across various locations in the United States, with a significant concentration of cases in Hawaii. These events persisted until around 17:50 and encompassed a range of aggressive behaviors, including assaults, mistreatment of minors, altercations, homicides, acts of vandalism, and incidents of robbery. Local law enforcement swiftly responded, encountering resistance from the individuals involved. Subsequently, a substantial number of rioters were apprehended and taken into custody.
&gt; 
&gt; **Stage 2**: Following the initial outbreak, the subsequent day witnessed the emergence of large groups of individuals advancing towards the western coastline. Despite the absence of apparent luggage or personal belongings that might indicate a mass migration, it became evident that these individuals were armed and not merely fleeing. Attempts at communication and interrogation by the authorities were met with threats and brandished weapons. Law enforcement endeavored to obstruct the movement of these groups, yet their progress remained unimpeded. It has been documented that non-lethal countermeasures, including the use of pepper spray, were employed to manage the situation, yet the masses remained impervious and continued their relentless march.
&gt; 
&gt; **Stage 3:** Continuing their course for two additional days, the groups exhibited an alarming disregard for the various countermeasures employed against them. Their aggressive tendencies escalated, prompting local law enforcement to adopt defensive positions. The convergence point of this movement was the city of [REDACTED], situated in proximity to the former location of Site-39. As the masses amassed near the vicinity of the facility, local police initially perceived the gathering as a demonstration. This perspective shifted when Director Díaz was apprised of the situation. In response, Director Díaz promptly dispatched a specialized team from Mobile Task Force MTF-Epsilon-11 (&#34;Nine-Tailed Fox&#34;) to evaluate and address the escalating riot-like scenario. Following, there&#39;s a conversation between Site-39&#39;s Security Tactical Direction and the leader of the MTF squadron.

&gt; **Sgt. Suarez:** Aight, we&#39;re down (//audible screaming//), there&#39;s a lotta people
&gt; 
&gt; **General Quill:** Do you see any sort of leader, or... someone leading the riot?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Suarez:** (//audible screaming//) Uh... no, it doesn&#39;t seem so (//audible explosion//) Fuck, they&#39;re throwing bottle bombs at us.
&gt; 
&gt; **General Quill:** What? What the hell is this about?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Suárez:** I dunno, maybe some info about the D-class breached or something... Although they don&#39;t look like human rights activists..
&gt; 
&gt; **General Quill:** (//sighs//) God forbid that, the RAISA and the amnestics team would have a year worth of work and we would be suspended (//audible voice in the background//) Ok, Director. Can you ask someone in the riot what&#39;s going on?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Súarez:** Yes, sir. James, go ask that guy. (//audible screaming and explosions//) But please be careful, judging by the bombs they aren&#39;t intending to be too friendly towards us. 
&gt; 
&gt; //Following 5 min omitted for brevity//
&gt; 
&gt; **James:** (//In the background//) I don&#39;t understand a shit! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Suárez:** What did he tell you?
&gt; 
&gt; **James:** He told me &#34;Let me join I&#34;! And then he tried to reach me through the fence.
&gt; 
&gt; **General Quill (Director Díaz):** Díaz here, are you sure he said that?
&gt; 
&gt; **James:** Yes, they&#39;re all doing so... Dunno what it means, is it maybe some sort of cult thing wanting something in the facility?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Súarez:** That is pretty unlikely, as we barely got any dangerous anomalies...
&gt; 
&gt; **James:** You know how these cults are, sir; they&#39;re crazy.
&gt; 
&gt; **General Quill:** Dissolve the riot; harm them if it&#39;s needed but don&#39;t terminate them, we don&#39;t want the Ethics shutting us down. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Suárez:** Right, we&#39;ll do what we can. Riot dissolver formation 3, boys, stay together.
&gt; 
&gt; //Following 30 min omitted// 
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Suárez:** (//audible shooting//) Sir, they don&#39;t care, we&#39;re even shooting them on the arms but they only get angrier... (//Metallic Fences crunching//) Oh shit, they&#39;re climbing the fences! 
&gt; 
&gt; **General Quill:** Aren&#39;t they reacting to the barbed wires and the electricity on the fences?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Suarez:**No, they aren&#39;t, they&#39;re even bleeding their guts out but they just keep... Hey! You there! (//audible running and fighting//) Guys, they got in the perimeter, come here! 
&gt; 
&gt; **General Quill:** (//Díaz talking in the background//) But... (//continued talk in the background//) Okay, but don&#39;t come saying it was my ide- (//audible radio on the background//) General Quill here, it better be important....
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Suárez:** (//audible running and shooting//) What are the orders!? Sir?
&gt; 
&gt; **General Quill:** Hold up, I just got a report of rebellion amongst the personnel. They&#39;re attempting to breach into containment wing 2.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Suárez:** (//audible shooting//) What? But what do we do with these guys out here!?
&gt; 
&gt; **General Quill:** Keep holding them back until we have solved the problem.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Suárez:** Copy sir, but I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be able to hold them back for much longer.
&gt; 
&gt; **General Quill:** I know, that&#39;s why I&#39;m organising an eventual transfer of the facility
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Suárez:** Right, I&#39;ll send some teams to assist you inside.
&gt; 
&gt; **General Quill:** No, no, stay where you are, we need you to keep them back, I&#39;ll send the rest of security.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; Soon after the riot had launched an assault on site-39, several security and MTF personnel turned against the on-site personnel, attempting to breach into SCP-7945&#39;s containment chamber through violent means. A group of security personnel was assigned to neutralize the rebellion. The team reported that the insurgents were repeating phrases, identical to those uttered by individuals affected by SCP-7945.
&gt; 
&gt; Site-39 was effectively but hastingly evacuated and all its contained anomalies were transferred to the nearest site until Site-39 was relocated.The riot [REDACTED] dissolved itself as they unexpectedly precipitated down a nearby cliff in an attempt to follow the vehicles transporting SCP-7945-1. 
&gt; 
&gt; In order to avoid any sort of public backlash, the Foundation introduced misleading religious artifacts and texts in the corpses&#39; clothes to appear as an unknown cult ritual.

Research on SCP-7945 continued in an effort to understand SCP-7945&#39;s euclid danger, noticing the relation between SCP-7945 and the assault on Site-39. The DMI [[footnote]] Department of Memetics and Infohazards [[/footnote]] sent out agents to locate the leader of the development of SCP-7945, whose personal data had been found during the Area-57 inspection on Tokunaga. Doctor Niklas Olsson was thereby tracked down and apprehended.

&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewed:** Dr. Niklas Olsson
&gt;  
&gt; **Interviewer:** Agent Sergio Jones
&gt;  
&gt; **Foreword:** Dr. Olson was interviewed by Agent Jones and asked about the manners of the development of SCP-7945 in order to illuminate the Foundation on the source of SCP-7945&#39;s effects
&gt;  
&gt; = **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; (//Agt. Jones walks into the room//)
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Olson:** Well, well, if it&#39;s not one of my captors.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Jones:** We just want to ask you some questions...
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Olson:** Spare me the pleasantries. I know your modus operandi. Answer your questions, meet an unpleasant fate. Isn&#39;t that how it goes? After all, I&#39;m a high-value target, too dangerous to be left breathing, am I right?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Jones:** Calm down. You&#39;re not as significant as you think. And the situation isn&#39;t quite what you&#39;re imagining. You&#39;ll receive amnestics and-
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Olson:** Yeah, yeah. I get it. I&#39;ll tell you what you want to know. Loyalties shift when the stakes are this high.
&gt;  
&gt; **Agt. Jones:** What do you mean?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Olsson:** Well, the people I worked for couldn&#39;t grasp the brilliance of my creation — the perfect weapon.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Jones:** How so?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Olson:** (//laughs//) They labeled my work &#34;unethical&#34; and accused me of misappropriating resources.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Jones:** Unethical? What exactly did you do?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Olsson:** Listen, let&#39;s cut to the chase. If you spare me, I&#39;ll help you bring those bastards down. Otherwise, do as you wish. I won&#39;t-
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Jones:** -Talk? Yeah, I&#39;ve heard that line before. I&#39;m curious to see how long you&#39;ll resist with our interrogation methods.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Olsson:** Uh-uh! Hold on. Look at this scar. Bangkor-89V. It&#39;s wired to deliver 89 volts to my brain on a specific trigger word. So, your options are limited.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Jones:** Fine. We can strike a deal...
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Olsson:** That&#39;s more like it. 
&gt;  
&gt; **Agt Jones:** Then, how did you even develop SCP-7945 instances with their cloning abilities?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Olson:**  Excellent question. The key lies in that &#34;god&#34; or whatever you want to call it. There&#39;s this secluded tribe in the Hawaiian archipielago that&#39;s supposed to be responsible of containing it, so I paid a visit to them... Once I gained their trust, I struck a deal to aid them in safeguarding the vessel that contained the &#34;god&#34; — some worms sealed in a jar.
&gt;  
&gt; **Agt Jones:** Wait, hold on, I got lost here. What god?
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Olson:** (//laughs//) Oh, right, guess I&#39;ll have to tell you the entire story. The god&#39;s some sort of evil deity obsessed with making his own existence the only one in the universe. You could learn a thing or two from them, the tribe I mentioned earlier. They housed a powerful deity in worms inside a vessel without any advanced technology. Meanwhile, your anomalies breach containment like it&#39;s their job.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Jones:** (//grumbles//) Ok, so you mean you went to a tribe and discovered this god thing, right?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Olsson:** Exactly
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Jones:** Tell me the truth. A secluded culture like that wouldn&#39;t just let anyone near such an important artifact, let alone a stranger. How did you manage to make this &#34;deal&#34;?
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Olson:** Like I said earlier, I spent considerable time ingratiating myself with them, gaining their trust. My superiors frowned upon it, thinking I was wasting time.
&gt;  
&gt; **Agt Jones:** Right, then how exactly do they contain the deity? I know it somehow is through worms, I mean how they transfer it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Olson:** Complicated. Long story short, it involves a ritual. But discussing it&#39;s off-limits; we held civilians hostage, against orders, for this, so I can&#39;t say...
&gt;  
&gt; **Agt Jones:** Ah, I assume that&#39;s how you transferred the deity; you couldn&#39;t replicate the mentioned ritual.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Olsson:** Yes, and only a select few trusted colleagues were privy. We didn&#39;t want any leaks.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Jones:** But how did you hide all of this from the rest of the team and your superiors?
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Olson:** Easily, actually. We claimed collaboration, a ruse to gain approval for this kind of development. Researchers were told the Elders -which were the ones held hostage- needed privacy for their &#34;cults,&#34; offering justification for their confinement.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt. Jones:** But did you only hold the Elders hostage? What did you do with the rest of the tribe?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Olsson:** Pretty simple, we destroyed them when I sent a team to retrieve the vessel and the Elders.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Jones:** Ok, returning to the development, what was your plan with this deity?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Olson:** Now, we utilized this &#34;god&#34; when creating the weapons to enable their unique cloning ability. We wanted to harness this power without triggering an uncontrolled apocalypse.
&gt;  
&gt; **Agt Jones:** So you were aiming to control it, I mean the deity.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Olson:** Not entirely control. We aimed to //isolate// its essence within a single specimen that would be stored safely while retaining its anomalous properties in others. The plan was to replicate these last instances on a large scale, creating a new line of profitable anomalies.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt Jones:**  But you couldn&#39;t achieve this, otherwise you wouldn&#39;t have terminated the project.
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Olsson:** Oh, no! We never halted the research; our intent was to continue refining and developing the instances for potential future use. We were backed into a corner due to my impending decommissioning and execution for my actions, which is where you come in. In a twisted way, you saved me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt Jones:** : If you choose to view it that way. Your cooperation will indeed have its benefits.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Olsson:**  I assume those &#34;benefits&#34; include honoring our arrangement?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt Jones:** Indeed, we&#39;ll make sure you help us some more, now, something that I don&#39;t understand is how you managed to make the Elders help you. I&#39;ve seen many similar groups claiming to protect an extremely important cause without caring about wether you kill them or torture them. What did you do to convince them? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Olsson:** //tja//, we simply utilized their faith against them: we told them that we would release the god to wreak havoc in the world if they didn&#39;t cooperate. We assured them we knew how to escape from this world to watch it burn while we drank champagne (//laughs//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Jones:** What did you do once you were done with them? Did you terminate them?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Olsson:** No, no, we expected them to teach our ritualists to perform the rite.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Jones:** Did they do it? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Olsson:** No, they didn&#39;t. From what I understood, my colleagues will continue trying, even after my decommissioning. 
&gt; 
&gt; = **&lt;End log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Dr. Olsson provided the presumed location of the Elders and was, after he no longer was an arbitrary source of information, assigned to non-lethal D-class personnel duty. An armed Task Force was deployed to retrieve the Elders for interrogation. For review of the results, a selected team from the Cryptozoology Division was assigned.

&gt; **Dr. Layton:** Of course not, the others are an evil group of weaponsmiths seeking to gain wealth through people&#39;s misery. They don&#39;t give any importance to common cause.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ka-poena-auao:** I still don&#39;t trust you, what assures me you&#39;re telling the truth and not more &#34;webbed&#34; lies?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Layton:** (//sighs//) Look, we heard the devastating tale about your people, and what they did to you and the rest of the Elders.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ka-poena-auao:** I don&#39;t like to say this, but they should burn in (Unknown word, presumably the name of a mythological figure)&#39;s mind.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Layton:** We&#39;ve made sure they were punished for their actions... And their tears were many.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ka-poena-auao:** That satisfies my soul.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Layton:** See? We are protectors, just like you, Kupuna.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ka-poena-auao:** In that case, and as we the Hejeaka are no longer capacitated to contain Jeaka, and since there are no more generations to pass the  I think my only choise is to trust you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Layton:** Indeed, we wish to know about this vessel your people protected to keep anyone from touching it. We, like you, will seal it in a place no one will ever get into.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ka-poena-auao:** The //Koelpa// was a cage, for the cage that would humilliate Jeaka for the rest of eternity. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Layton:** Sorry, kupuna, I am an ignorant, could you with your wisedom explain to me who Jeaka is, and why it has to be humiliated in that cage?
&gt; 
&gt; (//The interviewee&#39;s answer has been rewritten and clarified for brevity in a resume below//)
&gt; -----
&gt; 
&gt; The deity Lono, associated with fertility and reproduction in Hawaiian mythology, had a sibling named Jeaka. However, the other Hawaiian tribes shun mentioning or acknowledging him due to the dread of his malevolent influence. Unlike Lono, Jeaka wielded the power of fertility but lacked a peaceful nature. His selfishness led him to perceive himself as the most beautiful being in the world.
&gt; 
&gt; Jeaka turned his attention to the offspring of Papa and Wakea, the creators of all things in Hawaiian mythology, and bestowed his own likeness upon them. Upon witnessing this, Lono, along with the other deities, condemned Jeaka to be cast out of the world and imprisoned within the simplest and filthiest of Papa and Wakea&#39;s progeny; worms. As Lono&#39;s powers were limited, he could only banish Jeaka to the realm of the mind. Yet, the very children who confined Jeaka possessed his formidable abilities, bestowing anyone who came into contact with them with their own visage.
&gt; 
&gt; Jeaka became consumed by a desire to humble the offspring of Papa and Wakea, and to exact revenge upon Lono and the gods for his incarceration. Condemned to remain within them for eternity, Lono appointed us, the Hejeakas, as the guardians of Jeaka. To fulfill this duty, Lono instructed their forebears in the art of transferring Jeaka into other creatures in times of urgency. Additionally, he presented them with a vessel marked with his unique seal, ensuring that none would ever touch the hosts harboring Jeaka.
&gt; -----
&gt; 
&gt; **Ka-poena-auao:** Up until now, it has been our mission to guard Jeaka&#39;s hosts, but now that the Hejeaka are gone, you, Foundation, have to protect the world and its life, both animate and inanimate from him.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Layton:** Thank you, Kupuna, it&#39;s been an honor, but we need help from you; could you help us learn how to transfer Jeaka from a creature to another?
&gt; 
&gt; **Ka-poena-auao:** I apologize, but we can&#39;t, as it is something only us, Hejeakas are allowed to do, and took several generations to fully learn. It&#39;s too dangerous to do the rite, even for us, as Jeaka could escape.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Layton:** I understand. Now, I was wondering, Kupuna, isn&#39;t it easier if you kill the creatures?
&gt; 
&gt; **Ka-poena-auao:** No! Do not do it! If his cage dies, he will be free from the mind realm! That&#39;s why Lono assigned the Hejeaka to guard them! So they wouldn&#39;t die!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Layton:** Sorry, Kupuna, I beg your pardon, as I am ignorant [bows]
&gt;
&gt; **Ka-poena-auao:** I pardon you, if you&#39;re going to incage Jeaka&#39;s hosts, you&#39;ll have to make sure none of your guardians are near to it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Layton:** Why not? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Ka-poena-auao:** Jeaka is said to have really strong persuasion powers, whispering to people&#39;s minds to touch his hosts to give them his face, and therefore, invading their minds.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Layton:** Ah, I see, okay, thank you for warning us. Is there anything we can do for you, Kupuna?
&gt; 
&gt; **Ka-poena-auao:** Yes, as the Hejeaka is no longer needed, we the Elders would like to return to Hejeak&#39;ai to die and rest with our people, trusting that you will guard Jeaka and protect the world from him.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Layton:** It will be so, Kupuna, thanks for your trust and the honor of this conversation.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ka-poena-auao:** I give you my blessing and may the gods help you in this important mission. (//proceeds to do the Honi [[footnote]] (ho-nee) It is a greeting amongst hawaiian people that involves pressing the noses against each other and inhaling. This greeting is meant to show respect to the greeted. [[/footnote]] with Dr. Layton//) 
&gt; 
&gt; = **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Fullfilling the agreement, the Hejeaka Elders were transported and escorted back to their Island. There, the assigned personel was ordered to vigilate the Elders while they performed some kind of suicidal rite. The team escorting them made sure all of them were dead and, after destroying any kind of evidence of the Hejeaka&#39;s existence, returned to Site-39.

**Sub-item type: Thaumiel**

**Special Containment Procedures:** As SCP-7945-1 (both A and B) as well as eventual SCP-7945-2 instances contain SCP-7945-3 in their nöosphere, it is classed as a Thaumiel-type subanomaly. No SCP-7945-instances are to be neutralized, as doing so would cause an immediate containment breach and a potential XK-class end-of-the-world scenario. For that reason, at least 1 SCP-7945-1 and not more than 4 instances are to be kept //alive// in a singular Foundation facility. 

Due to SCP-7945-3&#39;s Infohazardous abilities, No less than 5 personnel can assist in the active containing of SCP-7945 instances. The designated personnel must undergo amnestizising weekly to prevent SCP-7945-3&#39;s traits affecting them.


**Description:** SCP-7945-3, commonly referred to as &#34;Jeaka&#34; is a male deity residing in all of SCP-7945 instances&#39; nöosphere. Notably, SCP-7945-3 has adopted an obsession with singularizing its own existence, and is capable of expanding itself through the cloning of SCP-7945 instances

Non-intelligent hosts to SCP-7945-3 haven&#39;t shown any signs of awareness of its presence in their subconcious, though tests show subjects reacting surprisedly towards the mutations caused by their own granted anomalous properties. 

However, it is notable that hosts with higher levels of intelligence, such as Humans, display more awareness. These hosts, denominated SCP-7945-2, will show aggressivity towards other organisms, often either killing them, mutilating them or hitting them. Individuals capable of vocalization are shown to repeat determinated sentences. These sentences are but not limited to the following:

* &#34;Let me make you me&#34;

* &#34;Become me&#34;

* (In languages where personal pronouns change the verb conjugation, all the verbs will be conjugated into first person: See Dr. André Pignon&#39;s daily log)

* &#34;I am all/everything&#34;

* &#34;You don&#39;t deserve to be&#34;

SCP-7945-3 Is capable of psychological manipulation, inducing thoughts and invasive dreams into affected subjects. 

The victims it targets seem aleatory, and it is thus unclear wether SCP-7945-3 chooses them with background meditation or not. SCP-7945-3 is a self aware infohazard, and has higher chances to target individuals who at their turn are aware of it. 

SCP-7945-3 seems to display slight reality bending abilities, such as being able to change and edit documents, diagrams and others even after their print, which it uses to psychologically manipulate potential victims or create awareness of itself to allow it to act against its victims.

Victims to SCP-7945-3 are impossible to treat unless provided with highly regular amnestication. All victims to SCP-7945-3 lose their prior psychological traits and personality once affected, as SCP-7945-3 replaces it with its own.
