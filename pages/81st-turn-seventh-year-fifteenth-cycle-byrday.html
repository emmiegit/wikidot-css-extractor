Snow.  I have heard of it, of course, but I had never seen it before[[footnote]] Temperatures do occasionally reach freezing in the Baro, but the atmospheric conditions needed to make snow are extremely unlikely. [[/footnote]].  I hadn&#39;t been certain at first, when I saw the small drifts in the shadows of bushes and rocks, but when I touched it, it was cold as Firstnight, and turned to water in my hands.

I had noticed it had been getting colder as I walked, but I had not thought anything of it.  But seeing snow, I realized that it must be much colder.  How is this possible, when it was so hot only a cycle ago?  I had not thought I had travelled so far.

I thought to keep going through, but soon the snow was getting ever deeper, even reaching into places where the sun fell[[footnote]] It&#39;s entirely possible that Aframos had reached the Wintered Lands by that point.  If so, turning back was his best option.  It&#39;s no place to go unprepared. [[/footnote]].  When the path was no longer clear of it, I had to turn back.  My robes are not enough to keep me warm.  Until I can find a place to get something warmer, I will need to turn back.  It will mean backtracking a cycle, but I have time.

It will mean chancing more encounters with the intruder, but it cannot be helped.  Perhaps I will find something that will be of some help.

At least I know most of the dangers on the way, as well as good places to camp.  I should be able to make the return trip without incident.</textarea></pre>
