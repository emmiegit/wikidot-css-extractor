Gilbert Buchs had a little game that he played in his free time lately: he sat in front of his computer, played one of his old New World Order Exposed videos, opened a bottle of bourbon, and then took a shot whenever he was right. Gilbert watched Video Gilbert stand in front of a dry-erase board. He had drawn a rectangle on it; it looked like someone had chewed off one corner. Suspenseful stock music played in the background.

&#34;Something... is happening... //in Kansas//.&#34; Video Gilbert drew a circle in one of the edges that hadn&#39;t been gnawed at. &#34;Last week, I caught word that there was a man out west who was struck by lightning and survived. If you think //that&#39;s// strange, you haven&#39;t been watching me long enough. What really matters is what happened afterward. I got to interview him, and you&#39;re about to hear some of the audio I taped from the encounter.&#34; The screen faded into black with the caption &#34;THIS HAPPENED RIGHT IN OUR BACKYARDS&#34;.

&#34;Okay... what can you tell me about the days between the accident and when they showed up?&#34;

An old man&#39;s voice responded. &#34;Well, uh... nothin&#39;, really. I just went along, building.&#34;

&#34;Describe the encounter, then.&#34;

&#34;I think I went to the door. I was in the middle of... I was holding a wrench. And I opened the door. Then I was sittin&#39; down, like I was about to watch TV, but I didn&#39;t have one. I think I had thrown it out, or hooked it up to somethin&#39;, but everything I had been putting together was gone. Basement was clean.&#34;

&#34;You have memories missing.&#34;

&#34;All of it. I only know about the lightning &#39;cause of my health insurance, and &#39;cause of the lightning flower.&#34;

&#34;What&#39;s that?&#34;

&#34;When you get struck, it can leave a mark on your skin that... oh, here, take a look.&#34; There was a pause and some rustling; the old man had turned around and lifted up his shirt.

&#34;...Yeah, I see it. It looks like a huge tree tattooed into your back.&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s faded now, but it was a lot worse back then. And I only remembered what to build because one of the bits was hid out back. I made one of them... electric eels, like, out of some computers the middle school threw out.&#34;

Then there was a crashing noise. &#34;Good golly-- I gotta see what&#39;s goin&#39; on down there.&#34; Then there was some mumbling. and the old man said, &#34;No, no, no. You ain&#39;t allowed down there. I think you better be--&#34; The audio cut off and Gilbert showed up again.

&#34;Now, we can see two things are immediately apparent: one,&#34; he counted on his fingers, &#34;the lightning strike caused some sort of change in him that can&#39;t be explained by science.&#34;

//Gulp//. Gilbert downed a shot.

&#34;Two, he&#39;s being used to create some sort of machines, and someone is taking those machines for their own uses.&#34;

//Gulp.// Close enough.

&#34;You know what I think. That lightning was more than just bad weather. It was a //beacon//. Someone was teaching him.&#34;

//Gulp.//

&#34;Someone //alien//. And that memory blank was them coming to collect.&#34;

//Clink.// He set the shot glass on his desk.

&#34;There&#39;s something among us, folks! Something that&#39;s using us for its own ends, then wiping our memories of the experience!&#34;

//Gulp//.

&#34;Something inhuman!&#34;

//Clink.//

The rest was contact information; Gilbert cut it off. Then he looked at the bottle. //Damn//, he thought. //I should have been better at this.//

Gilbert stopped over at the used book store the next day. Cathie had wanted him to meet her there, and he felt like picking up something to read. There was a wiry kid in front of him in line who could have been Gilbert ten years ago. The boy was looking for something in particular.

&#34;It&#39;s got a bright red cover with sort of a, I don&#39;t know the term... Art Nouveau? Pop Art? It&#39;s got a design on it, and the title is &#39;Star&#39; something.&#34;

&#34;Sorry,&#34; the girl at the counter said. &#34;I know what you&#39;re talking about, and I&#39;m pretty sure we sold it yesterday.&#34;

The boy went to check Self-Help, and Gilbert rang up just as Cathie walked in. Cathie was middle-aged, was God&#39;s warrior on the frontlines against the encroaching Satanic movement, and wore a kitten sweater. She handed Gilbert and the counter girl a Xeroxed flyer.

The pair sat down. Cathie set the stack of handouts on the table. &#34;Gil, why did you want to see me?&#34;

&#34;What? I thought you asked me to come here.&#34;

&#34;No.&#34;

&#34;Oh.&#34;

&#34;Well?&#34;

&#34;I guess I just wondered what you&#39;ve been up to.&#34;

&#34;//Up// to?&#34; She tapped the flyers. &#34;I don&#39;t think my feet have touched the ground all week.&#34;

Gilbert leaned over to scratch his head. &#34;It&#39;s all true, Cathie. All of it.&#34;

&#34;I don&#39;t know what you mean.&#34;

&#34;This. The truth isn&#39;t out there anymore. It&#39;s //right here//.&#34; Gilbert held up a copy of Newsweek. The cover photograph depicted a dark-skinned child holding up a crude but accurate drawing of the Pepsi logo.

&gt; [[size 150%]]Virus Culture[[/size]]
&gt; 
&gt; What are &#34;memetic hazards&#34;, how are companies using them legally, and why has one convinced this boy that this is what faces look like?

&#34;Newsweek has the scoop on me. My job is pretty much over.&#34;

&#34;You&#39;re just giving up on fighting the conspiracy?&#34; Cathie pointed at the flyer in Gilbert&#39;s hand. &#34;I&#39;m trying harder than ever.&#34;

&#34;What&#39;s there to fight? According to the //Times//, Two-Three-Nine is in US custody, and they&#39;ve told her that whatever &#39;magic&#39; they tried to teach her doesn&#39;t work. Two-Three-One was someone else, and the //Guardian// says that she was handed over to the GOC because she wasn&#39;t actually human, or isn&#39;t anymore, or something. I don&#39;t even know who that is in the photograph.&#34;

Cathie cringed at the mention. &#34;The Global Occult Coalition.&#34; Both &#34;occult&#34; and &#34;global&#34; sounded like profanity coming from her. &#34;They&#39;re the evil army of the one-world government. Like the Peace Corps and FEMA combined. Times //ten//.&#34;

&#34;What? No, they aren&#39;t. That SCP thing is being cut up and served to governments like a... like a sheet cake, and the GOC is trying to keep this stuff out of their hands. They&#39;re doing the right thing here.&#34;

&#34;Gilbert, everyone thinks they know the truth now. But //we// know better. At least, I thought //we// did.&#34; 

A thought crossed Gilbert&#39;s mind: //was she in denial?// He stopped himself from saying it; instead, he tapped the stack of newspapers and magazines. &#34;It all adds up. Proof positive. You don&#39;t have to rely on...&#34;

&#34;Conspiracy theories?&#34;

Gilbert turned paler. &#34;That&#39;s not what I meant.&#34;

&#34;Yes. It is.&#34; Cathie picked up her flyers. &#34;I should go pick up the kids from soccer.&#34;

&#34;Still homeschooling?&#34; Gilbert tried to change the subject, but Cathie wasn&#39;t having it. She stood up, went to leave, then turned around for a last thought.

&#34;What happened to you, Gilbert? You&#39;re reading //mainstream media//. You&#39;re just like them!&#34; She waved an arm in no particular direction.

&#34;Or maybe they&#39;re just like me.&#34;

----

That night, Gilbert sat down and read everything he could from all his old favorite sites. It was nothing he didn&#39;t know already. He wanted to get excited. He wanted to //find// something. But... it was all true. All of it. 

Gil opened YouTube and scrolled through his account playlist until he found it. &#34;Forget Everything You Know -- Bigfoot Is REAL&#34;.

Gilbert was about to get //wasted//.</textarea></pre>
