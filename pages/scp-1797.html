**Item #:** SCP-1797

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Isolated samples of SCP-1797 are contained at Site-197, under standard containment procedures for viral agents.

Instances of SCP-1797-A created for testing must be kept in isolated chambers at all times. If a direct interaction with a SCP-1797-A instance is necessary, the organism must be remotely sedated, and any personnel entering its chamber must adhere to Biosafety Level 2 procedures. Any materials remaining after the testing is concluded must be disposed of via incineration.

**Description:** SCP-1797 is an anomalous strain of influenza, primarily transmitted through contact with SCP-1797-A. Apart from its anomalous properties, SCP-1797 is similar to other influenza strains: the virus causes symptoms such as fever, coughing, and fatigue, can be treated with antiviral medications or overcome naturally by the host&#39;s immune system.

Two days after infection, several large tumors will begin to grow on the host&#39;s body. Typically, from 5 to 8 tumors will develop at a time. The tumors will continue to grow for several days, reaching 12-20 cm in size and gradually taking the shape of an instance of SCP-1797-A. Once fully grown, SCP-1797-A will animate and detach from the host&#39;s body. The process will repeat for as long as the host is infected with SCP-1797.

SCP-1797-A have the appearance of //Felis catus//, domestic cat, from 3 to 8 weeks old depending on the instance. Genetically, instances of SCP-1797-A are identical to the individual they originate from. The organisms do not age once detached from their host and are unable to breed. The average lifespan of SCP-1797-A is two years.

SCP-1797 was discovered during an outbreak in Nizhnevartovsk, Russia. The outbreak was traced back to Vsevolod Nikolayevich Chernodubov, a 92-year-old citizen of Nizhnevartovsk. Several witnesses had confirmed that Chernodubov have been selling and giving away domestic cats as a main source of income for the past 7 years. Examination of the Chernodubov&#39;s apartment revealed 23 living instances of SCP-1797-A, partial remains of approximately 60 more instances, as well as numerous tools, tableware and several pieces of furniture constructed from materials gathered from SCP-1797-A. Chernodubov was taken into the Foundation custody, where he expired two weeks later due to health complications caused by prolonged undernourishment.
