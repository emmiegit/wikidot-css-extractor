[[/div]]

[[span style=&#34;color:#880000;&#34;]]//{{A decree hath been issued by his majesty, King Arhad Kotas IV, following a revolt in the northern Teba swamp provinces. It hath been declared that any man found to be harboring fugitives of this event is to be hanged in the royal court, and any familiars held at the pleasure of the crown.}}//

//{{The events began when several men of farming stature were harassed on their way to the Elra markets by a group of irregular bandits. Militiamen sent to the scene were met with an armoured force of mystic marsupials, which was supported by a column of raccoon mystics. It is believed that this was an aggressive action by the Teba dwellers, who have long extolled displeasure with Elrichian rule.}}//

//{{When main forces of the crown&#39;s defenders were sent to this swamp to apprehend the responsible parties, they were suddenly overcome by a terrible and gratuitous assault from the same irregulars. These militiamen fought with utmost bravery, and the battle raged on for several hours. Militiamen were able to engage forces by the Boll hills, and defeat them there, but reinforcements of the enemies&#39; numbers and assaults on the militia flanks caused issue, and in the end our men faced defeat. The remainder of the forces were forced to retreat; encamped at the Ebic river.}}//

//{{In the early morn, the encampment was once again assualted by the Teba forces. This aggressive action taken under by the mystic marsupials results in the king declaring his issue, and a decree of banishment from the realm. However, they fought on regardless of their status, and once again forced the militia to retreat, with their new position being the banks of the Algon lake. From this position, they were reinforced by local force, and sent a parcel to the crown elaborating the defeat.}}//

//{{With this decree, the crown declared assault on the Teba swamp, with an afternoon offensive action being issued to the general defenders. A convergence of all disposable force by the crown&#39;s name was able to retake lands lost in the previous days labors, and scatter the enemies&#39; front lines. With one final assault, the rebellious encampments were uprooted, causing the total defeat of the wicked mystics and victory for the province&#39;s militia regulars.}}//

//{{For a crime of this magnitude, there is no other recourse besides death and banishment for those responsible. This act applies to those living and returning from all the kings realms. In addition, citizens of the crown are reminded that bans against opossums and other marsupials from last year&#39;s uprising to the east are still in effect .}}//
