[[tab SCP-7121]]
[[[SCP-7121]]] - **Caw**sing **Caw**latteral Damage: A mischievous little Crow that loves Cawsing Cawos. It’s the first one, the OG, the real deal, you know it you love it, give a round of applause for our feathered little buddy SCP-7121!!!!! //CLAP CLAP CLAP//. The idea for the article came from a conversation in the IRC in which I joked about a bird that was normal by all means except that they just couldn’t get rid of it for whatever reason. I thought… Hey, that’s not a bad idea actually! and so the crow was born.
[[/tab]]

[[tab SCP-7911]]
[[[SCP-7911]]] - What&#39;s your Emergency?: A story of betrayal, and revenge: Seemingly ordinary medical supplies with a mysterious past that turn into instruments of demise when applied. This was the idea that made me come to the site in the first place. I was inspired by the idea of “reverse healing&#34; I wrote it, joined the site, and then coldposted it immediately! It then got immediately deleted cuz I had no idea what I was doing. I joined the community and after reworking the idea I got it to work and I’m actually quite proud of the story presented in it.

[[tab SCP-719M4-J]]
[[[SCP-719M4-J]]] - **Balls**: Unfortunately, your mother. Yeah this was just a really dumb idea that suddenly popped into my head. I will forever be known as the Ligma Guy now. Feels good.
[[/tab]]


[[tab SCP-7818]]
[[[SCP-7818]]] - The Promise: My entry for GoblinCon (2023)! The theme being &#34;Deletions&#34;: This was a collaboration with The [[*user The_Spider_Queen ]], [[*user Dianaberry]], and [[*user Marceline_Raynes]]. It follows a couple in a quest to hold on to what they find most dear. Their memories of each other. Err, what was I talking about?
[[/tab]]

[[tab SCP-7229]]
[[[SCP-7229]]] - **L**ost **E**ternally **A**midst **P**rofound **YEAR**ning:  The inspiration behind this was: What if leap year… anomalous? What if one extra day was added to the calendar every 4 years not because the extra hours that add up each year, but instead because every 4 years the earth periodically slows down enough to add a full extra day worth of time, and people were just mistaken until the foundation discovered it. And what if there was some mysterious force at play, that makes it so the foundation //needs// to keep it under wraps.
[[/tab]]

[[tab SCP-500-J]]
[[[SCP-500-J]]] - The Punchline:  Ba Dum tss.
[[/tab]]

[[tab SCP-7194]]
[[[SCP-7194]]] - Un//ant//icipated devotioin of those //in sects//:  It was inspired by a tumblr post about ants summoning humans as if they were eldritch beings. I thought of what one would think if an scp researcher suddenly heard ants chanting her name and they started to venerate her as a god. It was really fun to write, so I hope yall like it.
