[[/=]]

Well, in summation, Lady Fuchs is a rather shadowy figure. Literally. She originates from someplace unknown, but has never returned home for a visit. Her daily life consists of the exploration of far-off-worlds, the documentation of their wildlife, and the examination of the ecosystems which have formed around them.

She welcomes avid Library-goers to pick up a volume from her expansive collection, and learn a little bit at a time about some of the most fascinating, weird, and generally flavorful life which exists in the known and unknown multiverse.

++ But how can I contribute?
[[/=]]

Fuchs&#39; works do not follow much of a consistent visual format; do not be afraid to try out whatever formatting or visual styling you so please.

When writing a Fuchs article, ask yourself the following questions:

* Have I read the Hub? (Well?)
* Have I read the existing Fuchs articles?
* Am I a good person?

It is also important to keep in mind that:

* Fuchs uses she/her pronouns, but is canonically genderfluid/genderless,
* Her home/place of origin no longer exists; the reasoning for this is to remain murky,
* Her design (which, for now, only exists in our collective subconscious) is visually inspired by shadow puppets and their ability to ‘shapeshift’; Lady Fuchs is a shapeshifter,
* Fuchs is better than you in every possible respect.

Hope this helps! Good luck! Happy... fuchs-ing!

This is an awful name.</textarea></pre>
