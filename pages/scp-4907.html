**Item #:** SCP-4907

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-4907 are to be stored within standard containment lockers. Any and all Foundation personnel may request to be exposed to an instance of SCP-4907 for personal reasons or otherwise.

**Description:** SCP-4907 is the collective designation for three ceramic lawn gnomes. Physically, all instances of SCP-4907 are identical to non-anomalous lawn gnomes.

SCP-4907&#39;s anomalous effects occur after a sapient subject has been within five meters of at least one SCP-4907 instance for at least ten minutes. After the subject leaves the proximity of the SCP-4907 instance, a single folded piece of paper will appear in a location related to the subject, typically their pocket, desk, or some other location the subject checks frequently. Written on the paper will be a single Shakespearean-style sonnet about the subject, describing them in a matter that the subject would find flattering. 

SCP-4907 instances show a certain level of omniscience in regards to exposed subjects, and often incorporate certain specific details about subjects&#39; lives in each poem. Each poem to date is unique, and there is currently no known limit to the amount of poems a single subject may receive if exposed to an SCP-4907 instance repeatedly.

Subjects who read poems created by an SCP-4907 instance will typically report feeling happier, more confident, and less stressed about personal problems. Whether this effect is anomalous or otherwise is inconclusive.

Below is a list of example poems gathered from experiments with SCP-4907 instances.

&gt; **Recipient:** Researcher Harold Barnaby
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; So brilliant, majestic, Barnaby
&gt; His intellect can never quite be matched
&gt; So many men wish that they could be he
&gt; Adoring fans they cling, they are attached. 
&gt; 
&gt; His genius mind, his excellent rapport
&gt; Quite humble &#39;bout it all, he&#39;s quite the man
&gt; His only care is goodness, he adores
&gt; The idea of doing what he can.
&gt; 
&gt; This modern hero, mythical and wise
&gt; Oh Doctor Harold Barnaby, it&#39;s true
&gt; There is no man with brain or heart your size
&gt; Not one person on Earth as great as you.
&gt; 
&gt; Though some things were embellished several ways
&gt; You honestly deserve to hear some praise.

&gt; **Recipient:** Francis Paloma, Site-22 Janitor
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; When poppa comes on home, everyone
&gt; Will squeal with glee their daddy&#39;s finally here
&gt; Three growing girls, one tiny baby son
&gt; And certainly his loving wife will cheer.
&gt; 
&gt; In tiredness, good poppa still does play
&gt; With dolls and cars and other fancy toys
&gt; He always makes good time for every day
&gt; If forced to choose, family is his choice.
&gt; 
&gt; Now fifteen years a happy married man
&gt; His wife is luckier than she will know
&gt; He cries knowing no moment sweeter than
&gt; The day they married, seems not long ago.
&gt; 
&gt; Though dangerous your job may seem to be
&gt; You&#39;ll always have your loving family.

&gt; **Recipient:** D-39985
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; There ain&#39;t no walls that keep this fire down!
&gt; There ain&#39;t no ceiling stifling her fight!
&gt; There ain&#39;t no nails sticking her to the ground!
&gt; There ain&#39;t no way she&#39;ll never see the light!
&gt; 
&gt; A warrior, a true and righteous lass!
&gt; Her blood boils over, anxious to be free!
&gt; Her kicks are strong, and she will kick your ass!
&gt; The time will come when she&#39;ll rule SCP!
&gt; 
&gt; To be the best? She&#39;s already got that.
&gt; To challenge her would be the plight of fools.
&gt; Ain&#39;t no one better than this coolest cat!
&gt; Patricia reigns! Patricia Walters rules!
&gt; 
&gt; Don&#39;t give up hope, just keep your fight alive
&gt; Cooperate for now and you&#39;ll survive.
&gt; 
&gt; //Note: Despite the message endorsing D-39985 to forcefully break free of her confinement, she has since been significantly more cooperative and docile compared to before exposure to the SCP-4907 instance.//

**Addendum:** During an experiment regarding repeated exposure to SCP-4907 instances, the following note manifested in place of the standard Shakespearean sonnet.

&gt; **Recipient:** Researcher Leo Holt
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; Please don&#39;t die tonight.
&gt; We know that this is breaking character, but we couldn&#39;t just hold this in.
&gt; You&#39;ve been looking for a sign for what to do.
&gt; Consider this your sign.

After reading the note, Researcher Holt immediately left the Site-22 premises and did not return for the day. He returned the day after.
