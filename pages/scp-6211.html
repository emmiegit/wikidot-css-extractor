[[span class=&#34;bigtext&#34;]]SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:[[/span]] All SCP Foundation Overseer personnel are to annually review this file, exposing themselves to the memetic inoculant attached above. Similar inoculants are to be disseminated to all vital personnel prior to the first Friday after American Thanksgiving. Attempts are underway to suppress SCP-6211 in public media, but success in this endeavour is not expected due to its inexplicable popularity and the high profile of [/scp-2011-ex its creator].

[[span class=&#34;bigtext&#34;]]DESCRIPTION:[[/span]] SCP-6211 is a combination of tones and spoken words producing extreme agitation and distress in 96% of those exposed. Though there are no lasting effects, SCP-6211 is an extraordinarily potent and disruptive piece of memetic weaponry.

[[span class=&#34;bigtext&#34;]]FOREWORD:[[/span]] Though Dr. Harold Blank of Site-43 raised suspicions over SCP-6211 as early as 2015, it was not until the following incident in the Memetics and Countermetics Section of that same facility on 20 December 2021 that its cognitohazardous nature was confirmed.

**Dr. Lillihammer:** Where is--

//&lt;A screeching tone underlays the two notes, which increase in tempo and tremolo. A dull percussive sound, as of bells through a low-fi filter, is added to the mix. One technician begins to sob. Several are becoming visibly angry.&gt;//

**Dr. Lillihammer:** Whose--

//&lt;A processed male voice begins to recite a rambling ritualistic monologue. Cognitohazardous content is expunged from this point forward.&gt;//

**Voice:** ███ ████ ██ █████
**Voice:** ███ ████████ ██
**Voice:** █████ ████ ███████
**Voice:** ███ ██████ ██████

//&lt;Dr. Lillihammer is actively seeking out the source of the disturbance. Her colleagues are reacting with extreme frustration to the voice, loudly and sometimes violently refusing to accept its assertions. One researcher swipes all reading material off his desk and begins to shout.&gt;//

**Researcher:** FUCK YOU PAU--

**Voice:** ██████ ██████ █ █████████ █████████████
**Voice:** ██████ ██████ █ █████████ █████████████

//&lt;The words produce a devastating effect. All personnel not already affected by the anomaly begin to groan or growl in tandem, many joining Dr. Lillihammer in her search for the origin of the noise.&gt;//

**Voice:** ███ ███████ ██

**Voice:** ████ ████ ██ ████
**Voice:** ██████ ██████ █ █████████ █████████████

//&lt;The repetition of the chant has a visible effect on the morale of the search party, who are now overturning desks and pulling out drawers to discover the source. &gt;//

**Voice:** ███ █████ ██ ████████ ████ █████ ████

//&lt;The tones echo the words, mocking and off-key. A choir begins to &#39;sing&#39;.&gt;//

**Choir:** DING DONG DING DONG DING

**Dr. Lillihammer:** SHUT THE FUCK UP

//&lt;The choir begins to warble incoherently, interspersing with brief and ineffective vocal imitations of wind instruments and/or bells. Several researchers are now in tears.&gt;//

//&lt;A badly-distorted guitar rambles itermittently.&gt;//

**Voice:** █████ ██████ ██████ █ █████████ █████████████
**Voice:** ██████ ██████ █ █████████ █████████████

//&lt;Dr. Lillihammer deactivates all main circuit electronic devices in the Section, including the public address system. The noise is unaffected.&gt;//

**Voice:** ███ █████ ██ ████████ ████ █████ ████
**Voice:** ███████ █████████ ███ ████ ████

//&lt;The atonal choral intervention resumes, the voices increasingly flat and manic.&gt;//

**Voice:** ███ ████ ██ █████
**Voice:** ███ ████████ ██
**Voice:** █████ ████ ███████
**Voice:** ███ ██████ ██████

//&lt;There is a plaintive, agonized groan on the audio track. The assembled researchers echo it.&gt;//

**Voice:** ██████ ██████ █ █████████ █████████████
**Voice:** █████ ██████ ██████ █ █████████ █████████████

//&lt;Additional voices cry out and are silenced by an incoherent warbling guitar which does not cease as the other instrumentations all resume simultaneously. Dr. Lillihammer discovers the source of the sound: Dr. W. Wettle is sitting alone in the Cognitohazard Exclusion Booth. A quick search of the control panel with her left hand (her right hand is clamped over her right ear, her left ear blocked by her left shoulder) confirms that the exclusion system has been inverted. Dr. Wettle appears to be confused; he is manipulating a portable music player, and frowning.&gt;//

**Voice:** ███ ████ ██ █████
**Voice:** ███ ████████ ██
**Voice:** █████ ████ ███████
**Voice:** ███ ███ ██████ ██████

**Voice:** ██████ ██████ █ █████████ █████████████

//&lt;A mocking choir sings &#34;Oh&#34; as the noise degenerates further.&gt;//

//&lt;Dr. Lillihammer enters the Cognitohazard Exclusion Booth, picks up the music player, and assaults Dr. Wettle with it until the audio ceases. Every researcher in the Section slumps into chairs, onto desks, or onto the ground, exhausted and relieved.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;bigtext&#34;]]AFTERWORD:[[/span]] Review of the video and cognitohazard-cleared audio immediately triggered a remote notification in the office of O5-4, who travelled to Site-43 in person to discuss the occurrence. Dr. Wettle explained that he had received the offending &#39;music&#39; on compact disc, and had attempted to listen to it in the most private location he could find, but he had misunderstood the function of the CEB and accidentally broadcasted to the entire Section. Noise-cancelling technology within the CEB had prevented him from hearing the hazardous audio himself.

YOU PERFORMED A RED-HOT CLOUD OF POISON BRAIN GAS AND FUNNELED IT INTO THE FACES OF EVERY MAN, WOMAN AND CHILD CURSED TO WALK THROUGH A WORLD WHERE DECEMBERS HAPPEN!
