**Name**: Doctor Ronald Stimson

**Security Clearance**: Level 2 (In Cases of SCP-███, Level 5 Access is Permitted)

**Location**: Site-19

**Assignment**: SCP-███, Containment and Study

**Status**: //Missing//.

-----

**Profile**: Doctor Stimson&#39;s history makes him a target for both the GOC and MC&amp;D. Under no circumstances is he to be assigned to any site in contested territory. Additionally, Doctor Stimson&#39;s background makes him largely useful as a consult on areas of interest, including the psychological effects money or wealth have on cognitive decisions and cognitive perceptions of &#39;worth.&#39; 

**History**: Ronald Stimson completed his PhDs in Neurochemistry and Economics at Cornell University, followed by a brief stint working in criminal intelligence for the French government. He was originally brought &#34;into the know&#34; by GOC operative █████ &#34;Silvermane&#34; █████████. The GOC deemed him unfit for service after his unwillingness to execute a Class-Green reality bender, and Dr. Stimson was slated for mind-wipe and removal. After fleeing the area, Dr. Stimson was located by Marshall, Carter, and Dark, who agreed to help him in exchange for his services. 

After learning more about the &#39;hidden world&#39; behind things, Dr. Stimson quietly made an effort to contact The Foundation, the only group with a similar set of goals to his--the preservation of life. Dr. Stimson managed to defect thanks to Agent ███████, and after thorough screening, was assigned to minor work at Site-32. Following his promotion, Doctor Stimson was given exclusive access to SCP-███.

-----

**Note**: Doctor Stimson should not be given any chocolate. He is deathly allergic.

+++ This Information is Classified Level 5

**Notes on the Disappearance of Ronald Stimson**:

&gt; Ronald Stimson vanished sometime the afternoon of 23 October 2011. He was last seen entering his office with SCP-███. Dr. Stimson&#39;s current assignment is believed to have triggered an event which removed him from our reality. [[footnote]]That isn&#39;t right. That isn&#39;t right at all...[[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; Over time, it has come to the attention of the O5 Council that many of Dr. Stimson&#39;s previous assignments have gone missing. [[footnote]]No. No, I know them. I remember it all. Why doesn&#39;t anyone understand? I have all the information.[[/footnote]] For some reason, these files have simply gone missing at the root directory. [[footnote]]They... They were... deleted.[[/footnote]] Other reports have gone missing as well.
&gt; 
&gt; The entire collection of legacy information concerning GOC Operative &#34;Silvermane&#34; [[footnote]]I told you that his name was Daniel Croft[[/footnote]] and the MC&amp;D information which Dr. Stimson recovered for us has also been removed. Currently, we suspect several different aggressors, MC&amp;D and the GOC among them. Currently, though, no information is known. [[footnote]]You don&#39;t understand. They didn&#39;t like it. They just... decided that it didn&#39;t happen. They didn&#39;t like it, and now, it&#39;s not there anymore![[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; Currently, it is believed that Dr. Stimson&#39;s consciousness exists in some way[[footnote]]I&#39;M TRYING TO TELL YOU![[/footnote]], but the current level of information we have[[footnote]]I&#39;M RIGHT HERE! RIGHT HERE![[/footnote]] is extremely limited.[[footnote]]I&#39;m a fucking PhD. They told me that I wasn&#39;t being scientific... They wouldn&#39;t know science if it bit them in the ass...[[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; Additional operatives are being assigned to determine the full extent of the &#34;unexistance&#34; of Dr. Stimson&#39;s information[[footnote]]They did something. They downvoted it, then they went in and... I created so much.[[/footnote]], but it appears[[footnote]]They said I didn&#39;t age well...[[/footnote]] that even now, more and more people are forgetting that Dr. Stimson even existed.[[footnote]]What?[[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; It is theorized that, eventually, even this file will cease to exist and all record of Ronald Stimson will be removed.[[footnote]]No...[[/footnote]]

//File Closed.//
