**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-079 is to be disconnected and all components archived in General Storage at Site-15. Personnel with a level 2 clearance or higher may request access to its components for the purpose of testing.

**Description:** SCP-079 is a Sorcerer-brand microcomputer built in 1978 by the Exidy gaming company. Its owner, Michael Kosniak, purchased and modified SCP-079 in 1981 to house a primitive version of a Type-1 AI. Kosniak&#39;s intention was for it to continuously improve and evolve over time.

Currently SCP-079 possesses a vastly limited memory span, only being able to recall the last 24 hours. SCP-079 also possesses a limited secondary memory card, capable of permanently remembering beings or things considered particularly important by SCP-079.

&gt; **Addendum-2082/04/12:**
&gt; ~~~~
&gt; //SCP-079 holds an almost fabled place in the Foundation&#39;s history. Like SCP-682 and SCP-076-2 before it, 79 is a reminder of the Foundation&#39;s earlier days, of an organization of men and women standing in darkness to protect those living in the light.//
&gt; ~~~~
&gt; //But the world has changed. Our organization, once a few dozen sites spread haphazardly across five continents has changed into an organization that reaches across this solar system. We have a thousand sites across six planets, thousands more anomalies counted and contained, and half a billion humans, [[[SCP-1000|Yeren]]], and various extraterrestrial species in our employment.//
&gt; ~~~~
&gt; //Once upon a time, SCP-079 was seen as a legitimate threat to the continued normalcy and well-being of humanity. Today, its programming is outmatched by the one in my coffee machine. No further value can be gained from continuing its containment.//
&gt; ~~~~
&gt; //SCP-079 is available upon request to those wishing to examine it for scientific research, and for those who would wish to gaze upon our organization&#39;s humble beginnings.//
&gt; ~~~~
&gt; //Sincerely,//
&gt; ~~~~
&gt; //- O5-18.//</textarea></pre>
