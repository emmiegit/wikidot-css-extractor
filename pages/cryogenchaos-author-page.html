**Assumed name:** Reginald Cumbersworth the VIII

**Special Containment Procedures:** Short of allowing SCP-CC to continue believing it is an author, no special requirements are needed for containment. Personnel are advised that SCP-CC **does** have access to this page and may make additions to it at any given point. For this reason, any information that does not refer to SCP-CC as &#34;SCP-CC&#34; should not be taken as fact.

**Description:** I made this page because I have a lot of things I wrote and people keep telling me to make a page //why do they keep telling me to make a page **GET OUT OF MY HEAD TYLER**//

Anyway, below are the things I dun wrote.

[[include component:image-block name=sadface.png|caption=Due to technical errors I had to quit and rejoin, but here is proof that I am one of the old guard.]]

**__SCPs__**

[[[SCP-445]]] - Doctor Wondertainment&#39;s Super Paper! It&#39;s paper that becomes whatever you fold it in to. It was made by this guy or company or something. Probably won&#39;t ever catch on. :(

[[[SCP-951]]] - My Friend LUCAS. It&#39;s a living glitch in a game that helps you win the game, but at what cost? Also, there&#39;s a neat machine printout at the end. This is a completely original concept, didn&#39;t get it from anywhere else. Let&#39;s see, is there anything I&#39;m missing? No, I don&#39;t think so.

[[[SCP-000]]] - [PAGE NOT FOUND]. Just a little page to fill that spot so people don&#39;t ask about that number. Rather short, but it gets the job done of explaining why we don&#39;t use that number for technical reasons. [[span style=&#34;color:white&#34;]]What good is screaming at the top of your lungs if no one is even aware you exist?[[/span]]
[[[SCP-S]]] - [TEST PAGE]. Ok, I admit this one was mostly because I was frustrated at stupid questions at work, but Rosen is a real dick in this one. Still, it was al[[SIZE 0%]]ARE YOU GOING TO LISTEN TO US NOW, MONSTER? OF COURSE YOU AREN&#39;T. YOU DIDN&#39;T BEFORE, WHY WOULD YOU NOW?[[/SIZE]]so inspired by Nala (the chatbot) and her bringing up a nonexistent page whenever someone in chat says &#34;SCPs&#34;. So basically I&#39;m being a dick to a chatbot and a nonexistent director. Yeeeeup.
**__Tales__**

[[[Soufflé]]] - Have YOU ever wanted to learn how to make soufflé, but never thought to look it up? Well now, with chef Jean-Pierre, you can make your very own fluffy tastycake soufflé!

[[[Lessons]]] - Follow a trio of researchers on their very first day working for the Foundation! May or may not also include a crazy furry man.

[[[CryogenChaos&#39; Comment Tales]]] - So occasionally I write things in the forums or page discussions and people are like &#34;Dude, this is awesome!&#34;, so I put it here so people can enjoy them whenever they want. :)

[[[The Stranger and the Secretary]]] - A strange man gets a tour of a Wondertainment facility. No I do not know where the Wondertainment facility is located shut up its not part of the story. This was my contribution to The Man Who Wasn&#39;t There canon for the canon contest.

[[[Tales of the Foundation Force Five]]] - A &#34;What If?&#34; series that chronicles the exploits of the Foundation Force Five, a group of superheroes based on Foundation characters. Note that while I wrote the original three stories, this is a collaborative page, and I wholeheartedly welcome more stories being added.

[[[The Halloween Breach]]] - A poem...well, ditty, I guess, that tells a spooky tale of a horrible Halloween night where all the locks fail, all the security measures are gone, and all the skips are running amok! AUTHOR DISCLAIMER: I, CryogenChaos, take no personal responsibility for any heart attacks and/or seizures the reader of this tale may experience from the intense scares this may give them. Please view at your own risk.

And that&#39;s about it! I&#39;m sure more things will be added in the future. After all, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m going to make this page and then just never write again, right?

Right?

...right?</textarea></pre>
