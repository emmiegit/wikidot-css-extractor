[[[scp-4818|Leora]]] was beginning to suspect that she wasn&#39;t going to be able to figure out what kind of game the [[[scp-2273|freaky-looking bug man]]] was playing with that other lady in front of the gas fireplace. Her plan was simple: ask to join in once she&#39;d figured things out, have a lot of fun, and get more people to join so she could talk to them. The bug guy looked scary, but was apparently nice enough to play cards, but was impossible to read, the woman wasn&#39;t talking enough, and it looked like the cards only went up to sixes? Leora was starting to move from &#39;moderately confused&#39; to &#39;mildly annoyed,&#39; and having to look at those //clearly// fake logs behind them wasn&#39;t helping either.

The only reason she was even //doing// any of this pointlessly complicated scheme she&#39;d dreamed up was because [[[scp-3009|Stacey]]] had said she was &#34;a little off-putting&#34; when she just went up to people and said hi. Well, how was that Leora&#39;s fault? As far as Leora could tell, it was the //other// person&#39;s problem if they didn&#39;t like talking like normal people. But nobody here even //tried// to act normal! This was even the one place Leora could use the cool stuff she could do as an icebreaker, but //nooooo!// //Iris// had to go and grill her about it!

&#34;This is dumb,&#34; Leora proclaimed, holding her head up in a haughty manner. &#34;Why don&#39;t we just get our own cards?&#34;

&#34;Oh, uh, I don&#39;t have any cards,&#34; Stacey replied sheepishly, though less so than she normally would when the two of them first met.

Leora, however, was in no mood to look back on their relationship. &#34;Everyone has cards, Stacey. They leave them in your cell for free.&#34;

&#34;Um, well...&#34; Stacey glanced around. &#34;Mine never got it. I&#39;ve been here a bit longer than you...&#34;

&#34;Wha-&#34; Leora bristled. &#34;Yes it //did,// mine was there on day one, you... Stacey?&#34;

Despite their very important discussion, Stacey had seemingly done that thing where she saw something and stared at it like a deer when it hears a twig break. Groaning slightly, Leora followed where her gaze was pointing and found... a couple of normal-looking guards standing by the near wall talking like normal people. //Talking.// Stacey should take notes.

&#34;What&#39;s up?&#34; Leora asked in a tone that straddled the line between &#39;getting across how you feel about the conversation at hand&#39; and &#39;sounding so annoyed you start a fight.&#39;

&#34;The, uh... the guns...&#34; Stacey replied, not looking at Leora.

&#34;What?&#34; Leora took another look at the guards... Yup, still normal. &#34;Stacey, all the guards have guns. That&#39;s why they&#39;re guards.&#34;

&#34;I - I know //that!//&#34; Stacey replied indignantly. &#34;But those are //new// guns!&#34;

Yet another quick look at the guards showed that... Well, uh, they actually //did// have new guns. But still, regular guns. Nothing to be excited about unless you were a weirdo gun nut. &#34;So what? They probably just ran out of the normal ones. It&#39;s not a big deal.&#34;

After a few seconds, Stacey was still looking worried, and Leora frowned. Looked like the role of changing the subject fell to her once again. &#34;You know, Stacey, you never told me where you ran off for breakfast. I had to deal with Iris&#39; annoying friends by myself today.&#34; Well, she also thought Iris herself was a little annoying, but Stacey seemed to like her.

&#34;Oh. Um, I just wanted to... check things out a bit.&#34; Stacey still looked like she wasn&#39;t paying attention to the person who //chose// to hang out with her for the afternoon.

&#34;Really? Who&#39;d you talk to?&#34; Leora pressed.

&#34;The, uh, that, uh, bug guy. And some other people. [[size smaller]]They were kinda weird, though...[[/size]]&#34;

&#34;The bug guy?&#34; Leora shot up, and then quickly brought her voice down again when she remembered he was in earshot and might not like being called that. &#34;What was he like?&#34;

&#34;He&#39;s nice, and...&#34; Stacey trailed off again.

Leora frowned. It looked like Stacey wasn&#39;t going to get off the topic. Well, then, it just fell to her to cheer Stacey up - //again.// &#34;Look, I can go and ask Iris if you want. She knows, like, everything.&#34; Leora didn&#39;t want to bother Iris - even if she tried to be nice, it was clear she didn&#39;t like being spoken to when trying to relax (or as close as she got to relaxing) - but it was worth it if it would get Stacey out of her funk.

&#34;What? Oh, no. It&#39;s fine. Um. How would you even know where she is?&#34; Stacey seemed like she could barely keep up with her own brain.

&#34;She&#39;s only ever in one of three places at this time of day. The gas fireplace, and the two heaters,&#34; Leora listed off. She usually ping-ponged to whichever one was currently running. Leora had once told her she reminded her of a cat in that sense, but she just grimaced and said she &#39;Didn&#39;t like cats very much anymore.&#39; She had a habit of saying vaguely disconcerting stuff like that and never elaborating on it. A lot of people here did, in fact. It kind of got on her nerves sometimes.

&#34;I just, um. It&#39;s fine. I don&#39;t want to bother anyone,&#34; Stacey said after a moment&#39;s hesitation.

&#34;Well, you&#39;re bothering //me,//&#34; Leora groaned. When Stacey looked at her with a face that looked almost scared, she amended her statement with &#34;Look, I can tell you&#39;re upset. Why don&#39;t we just ask someone?&#34;

&#34;Is there something you two need help with?&#34; came a male voice from behind Leora.

She jumped a little and spun around to see a familiar-looking man smiling at the two of them like some kind of creep. His clothes marked him as an anomaly and he looked pretty familiar, was he... Oh, he was that guy Iris liked to scold. Richard or something?

Stacey made a half-wave with her hand. &#34;A-Ah, hi, Rainer.&#34; Right, [[[scp-4051|Rainer]]]. &#34;No, it&#39;s - it&#39;s fine, Leora was just-&#34;

&#34;Stacey&#39;s scared of those guards with the new guns but doesn&#39;t want to ask Iris what they&#39;re for.&#34; Leora was sick of Stacey&#39;s waffling.

&#34;Oh. Uh...&#34; Rainer rubbed the back of his head. &#34;You know you can just go up and ask, right?&#34;

Leora blinked. &#34;Whaddaya mean?&#34;

&#34;They have to tell you what&#39;s up if you ask,&#34; Rainer explained. &#34;With procedures and guards and all that. Something about informed... something. Didn&#39;t you guys read all the stuff they gave us?&#34;

Leora cleared her throat and scratched the top of her head. Stacey pursed her lips.

&#34;Alright, I&#39;m not here to chew you guys out or anything,&#34; Rainer said with a smile that only looked a //little// forced. &#34;I&#39;m sure if you ask, they&#39;ll explain it.&#34;

Another silence.

&#34;...//Or// I could just go up and ask and you two could listen.&#34;

&#34;Oh!&#34; Stacey perked up. &#34;Okay. Sure. If you want. You don&#39;t have to.&#34;

Leora rolled her eyes. &#34;Yeah, if you could. Thanks.&#34;

Rainer nodded and made his way over to the two guards in a very nonchalant way for someone approaching people ready and willing to blow him away. Leora scampered after him, and Stacey tiptoed behind her. Once they got close, one guard nudged the other on the shoulder and gestured towards Rainer, and the two of them looked at him with a professional yet stern air. Rainer didn&#39;t seem to care that these people had guns, he just kept confidently walking toward them. Leora was starting to think she might understand why Iris didn&#39;t like him.

&#34;Hey guys.&#34; That introduction was far too cordial for Leora&#39;s taste, though, hey, maybe he knew something she didn&#39;t (but probably not).

&#34;Hello,&#34; the guard on the left said. Then, after a second, &#34;Do you need something?&#34;

&#34;Yeah, just a quick question for you guys. What&#39;s with the guns?&#34;

The guards looked at each other, then back at Rainer. The taller one seemed reluctant to speak again, but the shorter one certainly didn&#39;t seem to be in a hurry to respond. After a little while, the tall guard responded with a simple &#34;...What?&#34;

&#34;Well, those are new guns. I was just wondering what was up. Are those shotguns? Seems like an odd thing to have in such a crowded place, is all.&#34;

&#34;Uh huh.&#34; The taller guard once again looked at his partner, who just shrugged.

&#34;Look, it&#39;s for a specific anomaly. That&#39;s all.&#34; The shorter guard seemed like he didn&#39;t want the conversation continuing if his tone was any indication.

Rainer looked back over his shoulder to Stacey, who still seemed anxious. He obligingly turned back to the guards. &#34;Which anomaly?&#34; he pressed. &#34;I think I have a right to know if they&#39;re potentially dangerous enough to-&#34;

&#34;//Alright,// we get it.&#34; The shorter one cut him off. He seemed //clearly// upset with Rainer - Leora was glad he was falling on the knife, especially because it looked like he didn&#39;t really understand how annoyed the guards were - but it looked like she really //did// need to tell Rainer what was up. &#34;Anticoagulant flechettes are the best way to neutralize a Blood Striga. Happy?&#34;

Someone behind Leora suddenly began coughing.

&#34;A //what?//&#34; A new voice spoke up, mirroring Leora&#39;s thoughts. Leora turned to see Iris poking her head out from behind the gas fireplace.

&#34;Told you,&#34; Leora whispered to Stacey.

&#34;Oh, yeah, I heard about those.&#34; Rainer stroked his chin thoughtfully. &#34;They&#39;re, like, super pretty women that&#39;ll eat your organs or something.&#34;

&#34;We don&#39;t-&#34; The woman who was playing cards with the bug man suddenly stood up, indignant for a moment before her face turned red as she saw all the people looking at her. &#34;Striga don&#39;t... eat people alive...&#34; she said, noticeably quieter, failing to refute the actual claim of eating human organs.

After a few seconds of painful silence, Rainer spoke up again, hoping to lighten the mood. &#34;W-Well, you sure are very pretty!&#34; If looks could kill, Iris would have atomized him on the spot.

&#34;That&#39;s not, uh...&#34; The woman started scratching her sternum, which was covered up by a turtleneck under her jacket. &#34;Not quite what that means. Our beauty standards are a little, uh... different.&#34;

&#34;Marya...&#34; Stacey said quietly to herself. She looked almost scared of whatever that &#39;Blood Striga&#39; thing was, but she also looked... sad? Hadn&#39;t the two of them talked before? Leora should lighten the mood.

She nudged Stacey and looked back at this Marya lady, slouching with a gaunt frame draped in ill-fitting clothes and poorly kempt hair. &#34;What, does she mean ratty?&#34; she wisecracked, only for everyone to turn and look at her. Oh, wait. She forgot to whisper that. Oops.

The bug man stood up, towering over everyone else and staring right at Leora, who believed she felt in that moment how Stacey must feel all the time. &#34;Don&#39;t say such unkind things to the young lady,&#34; came a stern, accented voice crackling from a large radio near the bug man. &#34;You girls should know manners.&#34;

&#34;Well, it&#39;s just, that...&#34; Marya started scratching her neck. &#34;For us, it was all about... uh... &#39;wearing nothing but the blood of the heretics.&#39;&#34;

A very brief moment of silence was interrupted when a black-haired woman sauntered up to the scene. &#34;Hey, hey, now this conversation&#39;s going places. Tell me more.&#34;

&#34;Fuck off, Anne,&#34; Iris growled before looking back at Leora and Stacey. &#34;I mean, uh, shove off. Look, you two, Striga aren&#39;t that bad. You just need, like, an angry bicameral woman to punch them, the guns are just a protocol thing.&#34;

&#34;You mean bisexual?&#34; Anne snorted.

&#34;//Whatever.//&#34; Iris popped back behind the fireplace muttering to herself.

The guards looked at each other and then back at the anomalies again. The situation had clearly spiraled past them, but they didn&#39;t look like they wanted to insert themselves back into it. Rainer looked to be at a total loss.

&#34;I... I don&#39;t... What?&#34; Stacey half-whispered. &#34;I don&#39;t know what any of that is... I just want to play a board game or something...&#34;

&#34;That sounds like a good idea!&#34; All of them jumped about a foot into the air, as a cheerful-looking doctor appeared from apparently nowhere. His lab coat contrasted oddly with a greying beard and a Captain America t-shirt. &#34;I think a game would be great to bring you all together, seeing as you&#39;re //hanging out// anyway.&#34; The emphasis on &#34;hanging out&#34; made him sound a bit like a robot, but the smile didn&#39;t go away.

&#34;Yep! That&#39;s a great idea! A board game&#39;s fine with me!&#34; Rainer leapt on that like a leopard on a fat, juicy gazelle. &#34;Hey, do you know where the board games are around here?&#34;

The taller guard, who looked about as happy to be dragged back into proceedings as Iris usually was, pointed wordlessly to a table with a pile of tatty old boxes on, and the young man headed over there with a cheery nod to scavenge something. Leora wasn&#39;t //quite// sure when he&#39;d taken charge of the situation, and was caught between relief that //someone// had and an inexplicable resentment at his smugness in resolving a mess that was more or less his fault.

She was glad someone was enjoying himself, she guessed, but she wished he&#39;d tone it down a bit. Just because he was an old hand at this didn&#39;t mean that she was. Yet, at any rate.

&#34;How about Monopoly?&#34; the doctor suggested. &#34;I always had a great time playing that.&#34; Rainer dutifully retrieved it. Like the good little boy he was.

&#34;Not a lot else to do before they invented electricity.&#34; Leora made sure to whisper this time.

Anne grinned faux-ruefully. &#34;Well, this is where I bow out. Can&#39;t compete with someone on //your// level.&#34; She winked at Stacey, who made an awkward noise in response.

The doctor frowned. &#34;Aw, really? The fun&#39;s just starting! Don&#39;t you want to get involved?&#34;

&#34;Nah, I make my own fun.&#34;

The doctor - okay, she couldn&#39;t keep calling him that. &#34;Sorry, what&#39;s your name again?&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m Dom, great to meet you.&#34;

Hmph. She was most certainly not that friendly with her wardens just yet. &#34;Alright, Doctor...&#34;

He laughed, a big belly laugh that was far too loud and too long for the situation. &#34;Nah, just Dom is fine. Anything else makes me feel like a grandad, and I&#39;m //way// too young for that!&#34; Still smiling.

Ugh. She had nothing against people smiling ordinarily, but there was something about that too-wide smile that far too many older people had on when they spoke to her. Did they think anyone fell for that?

Anyway, the doctor returned his gaze to Anne, and that grin dimmed slightly. &#34;Oh, that&#39;s a shame. I really think it&#39;d be best if you did.&#34;

There was a brief silence, as the motley crew of freaks side-eyed each other. The doctor&#39;s voice was entirely neutral, maybe a little disappointed, but... well, by and large they&#39;d been left to get on with things. That was the first actual instruction any of them had received today from anyone without blond hair and a belligerent attitude.

For a split second, she thought she saw Anne&#39;s smarmy facade crack into genuine uncertainty, but she quickly caught herself and responded with her own sickly smile. &#34;Well, you&#39;ve persuaded me. I&#39;m playing as the hat, though.&#34;

&#34;Great!&#34; The doctor pushed his glasses up his nose. &#34;Nothing quite like a game to bring people together!&#34; he called over his shoulder as he moved on.

//Yeah. Great.// Well, in fairness, she wasn&#39;t really opposed. God knew there wasn&#39;t a great deal to do in a containment cell; the chance to have a laugh with some people might even make Monopoly bearable. Plus, Stacey actually did seem up for it, which was a bit of a relief a this point. Now, Anne had been strong-armed into doing it, and she got the distinct impression Rainer wasn&#39;t going away. That was enough people for a game, she supposed, but she found her eyes wandering to the two figures in front of the fireplace, particularly the woman still staring studiously at her cards.

//Well, we&#39;re supposed to make friends here, I guess.// She approached slowly. &#34;Hey, uh, you want to play?&#34;

Marya glanced up at her in surprise. &#34;Really?&#34;

&#34;Yeah. I mean, uh, I don&#39;t wanna interrupt, or anything-&#34;

&#34;No, it&#39;s... it&#39;s fine.&#34; She sat a little more alertly and looked up at the bug man, still looming over them. &#34;Can Alexei join in?&#34;

Alexei? For some reason, she&#39;d expected him to have a more ominous name than that. He certainly looked more like a &#39;Blood Striga&#39; than the sad-looking woman slouched in the chair in front of her. Still, while she was apologizing... &#34;Uh, sure. If we have enough pieces, sure.&#34;

He looked at her, and she resisted the urge to shiver. &#34;Thank you, young lady,&#34; he intoned solemnly. &#34;This sort of game is quite new to me, though.&#34;

&#34;We can show you how to play,&#34; Stacey said, with something approaching actual brightness.

&#34;You are very kind.&#34;

As they headed to the nearest empty table, Leora leaned over to Marya as she stood. &#34;Sorry,&#34; she mumbled. &#34;For calling you-&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s fine,&#34; she cut in quickly. &#34;I&#39;ve been called much worse.&#34;

Leora gave her a grateful smile, and they went over too, as Rainer began to set up the board. &#34;Glad you&#39;re coming!&#34; he chirped. &#34;I&#39;m sure we&#39;re gonna have a great time!&#34;

----

//Tick.//

//Tick.//

//Tick.//

Rainer was absolutely certain that one of the skips here had some sort of time powers. That was the only reasonable explanation for why time had slowed to a speed that a slug would feel it had a fair chance of beating.

To their credit, his compatriots seemed to be as happy as he was. Stacey&#39;s initial awkwardness had given way to a sort of nervous enthusiasm, which in turn faded to a silence she seemed hesitant to break. On the other hand, Anne had had little enthusiasm in the first place, although she seemed determined to give the opposite impression. She was //really// starting to grate on him. Leora, meanwhile, had started out trying her level best to seem like she was having the absolute time of her life, but her energy levels had sagged and sagged in tune with the mood around the table.

Marya and Alexei seemed to be having a good time, though, although that might just have been down to the novelty of chatting with relatively normal people. Well, that and the rather galling fact that Alexei was wiping the floor with all of them.

&#34;Heya guys, how&#39;s it hanging?&#34; The doctor with the nice smile, Dom, might as well have been playing along with them, the amount of time he spent coming over and checking on them. Funny he hadn&#39;t picked up on the vibe.

Still, he was doing his best. No point in bothering him if they didn&#39;t have to. &#34;Oh, fine. We&#39;re having a great time, aren&#39;t we, guys?&#34; Rainer looked around the group, appealing. Marya gave a nervous smile, but Alexei was as unreadable as ever, Stacey did her level best to shrink even further into herself than she normally was and Leora just glared at him. Alright. //Great, guys, thanks for the support.//

Anne piped up with a bright smile and &#34;Oh, we&#39;re having a grand old time, sir! Thank you for taking an interest!&#34; There were a few snorts around the table, and Dom&#39;s smile cracked ever so slightly.

&#34;Well, uh, you know you don&#39;t have to do this if you don&#39;t want to. There are other things to do.&#34;

A brief sense of pity struck Rainer as he watched Dom shift. Poor guy had most likely just suggested something he&#39;d thought they&#39;d like to try and cheer them all up. He didn&#39;t deserve this. &#34;No, really, we&#39;re fine.&#34; He gave his best smile. &#34;Thanks for the suggestion though.&#34;

Dom sagged ever so slightly. &#34;Well, good. Hope you all have a cracking time!&#34; He scurried away. Leora made a face, mouthing &#34;cracking?&#34; and Anne murmured something that sounded suspiciously like &#34;Thanks, Wormtongue,&#34; but he couldn&#39;t //quite// be sure.

He was getting the slight feeling she didn&#39;t actually like him. That was fine. She&#39;d get used to him. He knew there was a settling-in period at the Foundation, he&#39;d certainly had his share of difficulties at the start. She just needed a Friend. A senior figure who could show her what life here could be like, what the Foundation really needed from them.

After all, that was why he was here, wasn&#39;t it? He&#39;d been in the Foundation&#39;s care for a while, they trusted him. It was his job to mentor the junior figures here. They&#39;d need a guide, and who better than someone like him?

Still, he did wonder if this was the best use of his talents. Not that he was averse to the occasional game, he&#39;d played enough with his mom and dad when they were still together, but... he was a leader. A hands-on guy. Surely he should be showing them the ropes, teaching them the ways of the Foundation, trying to disperse the clouds of cynicism that seemed to threaten to burst above nearly every anomaly he&#39;d met here?

No. He shouldn&#39;t think like that. The Foundation knew what they were doing. He had to be here for a purpose. They needed him, after all, and this must be //where// they needed him. His not to reason why, and all.

He was interrupted from his reverie by Marya trying to hand him money. &#34;What are you doing?&#34;

&#34;I landed on Tennessee Avenue. That&#39;s yours, isn&#39;t it?&#34;

Rainer did a quick inventory check to make sure he hadn&#39;t missed something. &#34;I mortgaged it, you don&#39;t have to pay rent if it&#39;s mortgaged.&#34;

For some reason, she reddened, before looking away. &#34;Oh. Of course. I&#39;m sorry.&#34;

Despite having done nothing wrong as far as he could tell, he felt a slight churn in his stomach. &#34;It&#39;s fine, you can... give me money if you want.&#34;

Anne - //of course it was Anne// - smirked. &#34;Very generous of you.&#34;

&#34;I wasn&#39;t - I didn&#39;t mean -&#34;

&#34;Oh, I&#39;m just having fun with you! Try not to take it so seriously. What&#39;s your deal anyway?&#34; Anne leaned forwards, steepling her fingers and almost knocking the Chance cards everywhere with her elbows. &#34;Obviously, we //all// love it here, but you seem to take that to the next level.&#34;

Aha! Someone was interested at last. The young man puffed his chest out slightly. &#34;I&#39;ve been here for a while, and they trust me. They even let me go on missions, sometimes!&#34;

&#34;Like Iris?&#34; Stacey had an expression on her face that he couldn&#39;t quite read.

&#34;Well, she&#39;s been doing it longer than me, but yeah, basically.&#34;

&#34;What sort of missions?&#34; Leora pressed.

&#34;Um, I think that&#39;s classified.&#34;

&#34;You get any perks for it?&#34; drawled Anne, leaning back in her chair and folding her arms. &#34;God knows I could use some perks in this place.&#34;

&#34;W-well, uh...&#34;

//-&#34;We can no longer allow you to exit your containment unit, due to the threat you now present to the Foundation&#34;-//

//-beep, beep, beep-//

//-a drip in the arm, pumping dull, cloying sleep through him like sewage-//

//-beep, beep, beep-//

//-a silhouette and a dossier at the foot of the bed-//

//-floating, drifting through sanitized clouds, unable to breathe, unable to not breathe-//

//-beep, beep, beep-//

//No.//

He shook his head, and cleared his throat. &#34;If they want you, they&#39;ll ask.&#34; Despite his efforts, his voice was a little more subdued than he&#39;d like, and he realized he&#39;d been twisting and pulling the zipper on his uniform, his knuckles white. &#34;You, uh, don&#39;t have to do anything you don&#39;t want to.&#34;

A silence fell around the table, which Anne immediately broke by slapping her knees. &#34;Well! I feel like I&#39;m bonding with you all!&#34; Again, the smile on her face was wide, and Rainer barely knew her, but... if a sincere word had ever left her mouth, he certainly hadn&#39;t been present to hear it.

With a guilty look on her face, Stacey fidgeted with the dice. &#34;I&#39;m sorry. I-I-I didn&#39;t mean to make you all do this.&#34;

&#34;No, you&#39;ve done nothing wrong,&#34; Leora leapt in. &#34;We&#39;re all grown-up enough here to say if we don&#39;t want to do something.&#34;

&#34;You can be as &#39;grown-up&#39; as you like if you&#39;ve got Ms. George breathing down your necks every five minutes.&#34;

Rainer frowned. &#34;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s fair. He wants us to get to know each other. They do care about us, you know. Maybe you&#39;ve had bad experiences with the staff here, but they really are trying their best.&#34;

&#34;//Trying their best?//&#34; Anne actually laughed a little at that. &#34;So &#39;Dom&#39;s&#39; coming over here just because he cares about us? Take a look around.&#34;

A glance around the room revealed nothing untoward. &#34;I don&#39;t see anything wrong. They&#39;re just playing games.&#34;

&#34;Yeah, they are. All of them.&#34;

...huh. Now that she came to mention it, yeah, there were a lot of tables in the common area with slightly haggard anomalies rolling dice or playing cards. A lot of them looked like they&#39;d had more fun in their lives than right at that moment.

&#34;It was my idea, though,&#34; Stacey whispered. &#34;They, um, didn&#39;t suggest it, or anything.&#34;

Anne grinned. &#34;No, it was your idea here. And I&#39;m sure every one of those other people, who all look //so// like they&#39;re enjoying themselves, just //happened// to come up with it themselves.&#34;

They watched as Dom went to a table across the room, leaned over to say something, and chuckled as he straightened up. He moved to the next table and did the exact same thing.

&#34;It&#39;s weird, seeing this place from the inside. Nice to see that famous hospitality in action.&#34; //That damn smile//.

&#34;Alright, look.&#34; He held his hands up, getting the distinct impression the mood here was souring. &#34;He&#39;s a doctor, it&#39;s his job to make sure everyone&#39;s having fun.&#34;

&#34;Your head&#39;s not really that far up their asses, is it?&#34; said a sullen Leora. &#34;You&#39;re sat here too, how much fun are //you// having?&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s not the point-&#34;

&#34;What is your problem? We&#39;re not stupid, we all knew what was going on here from minute one, the least you can do is admit-&#34;

Stuttering, staccato static burst out from across the table, interrupting her. Initially, Rainer thought Alexei&#39;s radio was malfunctioning, but he soon realized the giant was... laughing?

&#34;What is it?&#34; Marya asked.

&#34;The mighty crows. All the power and wisdom in the world. And the best way they can handle all the strange and bizarre people they possess is to make them play children&#39;s parlor games.&#34;

It wasn&#39;t particularly funny. Rainer wasn&#39;t even sure what the joke is. But Anne snorted, and Leora giggled, and Marya shook her head, and without much lead-up at all everyone at the table was laughing too.

Everyone except him. He was just bewildered. &#34;What&#39;s so funny? They&#39;re doing their best.&#34;

&#34;//That&#39;s// what&#39;s funny!&#34; Leora choked out. &#34;//This// is their best!&#34;

&#34;I can&#39;t believe I got caught by these clowns,&#34; said Anne as the table settled down. &#34;How embarrassing.&#34;

&#34;I just wanted to have fun with some people.&#34;

Everyone turned to look at Stacey, slumped in her chair. &#34;I&#39;ve been stuck in a cell for ages, and I, um. I just wanted to meet some people and have a nice time. I just... I hoped they&#39;d try to help us do it.&#34;

//That&#39;s what they were doing, why couldn&#39;t they see?// Rainer went to say as much, but Leora glared daggers at him almost before he&#39;d even opened his mouth, and put an arm around her friend. &#34;Yeah, well. It sucks, yeah, but you&#39;ve got us. Well, you&#39;ve got me.&#34;

&#34;Hey, I&#39;m apparently not going anywhere,&#34; added Anne.

&#34;I think this is... nice. It&#39;s nice to have the chance to be with some people. Not guards or doctors, just people. Thank you for the opportunity.&#34;

Alexei shifted in his chair, which made an alarmingly loud creak of protest. &#34;It is never the generals you rely on. It is your siblings on the front.&#34;

&#34;We... we&#39;re not soldiers,&#34; Leora said.

&#34;Does not mean they aren&#39;t generals.&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s one word for them,&#34; Anne chimed in to a round of chuckles. She took a glance at Rainer. &#34;Kind-hearted, caring souls are a few more,&#34; she added hastily.

He shook his head. &#34;Just roll.&#34; She did so, mock-saluting with her other arm.

&#34;Alright, alright. Coming for you, big guy. Just wait till I get that last green.&#34;

This was it, Cain&#39;s time to shine.

&#34;Bes!&#34; he called, gesturing at a chessboard. &#34;Fancy a game?&#34;

Bes, knowing very well his odds of winning, started to refuse. He didn&#39;t finish.

&#34;Ooh,&#34; Nanaya crooned, &#34;I love chess! You should play.&#34;

Now having no choice, Bes put on his best game face and sauntered over to the table.

&#34;Don&#39;t worry,&#34; Cain taunted, &#34;I&#39;ll go easy on you.&#34;

He did not. If anything, this was the first time Cain //hadn&#39;t// gone easy on him. In a way, that was more upsetting.

&#34;Go again?&#34; Cain asked, tipping over Bes&#39;s king.

Looking down at what remained of his pieces, Bes wondered if he&#39;d somehow left his strategic edge in the boulder. He hadn&#39;t left his pride, though, which is why he refused to let Cain&#39;s smug smirk stand.

&#34;You bet,&#34; Bes growled, resetting his pieces.

-----

By the fifth game, Cain had started showing off. He seemed to be getting a kick out of taking as many pieces as possible before finishing the game. The worst thing, though, was the way he kept listing off all the &#34;gambits&#34; he was making and every scrap of boring chess trivia imaginable - all of which Nanaya found terribly interesting, of course. She kept giggling playfully while Bes was trying to concentrate. He flinched when she put one delicate hand on Cain&#39;s knee.

&#34;You know,&#34; Bes said, louder than he meant to, &#34;this isn&#39;t even fair! You can remember every possible move and configuration!&#34;

Cain smiled innocently. &#34;Practice makes perfect.&#34;

&#34;Yeah?&#34; Bes retorted. &#34;Well, how &#39;bout you practice this.&#34; Then he saved Cain some time by knocking over his own king. He also knocked over a bunch of other pieces with his indelicate swipe. That probably made him look like a sore loser, but Cain was a sore winner so that made it fair. He got up and started away to prevent any further embarrassment, but that backfired considerably when Kedesh-Nanaya didn&#39;t follow him. He looked back in dismay, but she wasn&#39;t looking at him; she was planting a kiss on Cain&#39;s cheek. Cain saw him, though, and the grin on his face was the kind that a less merry man would&#39;ve wanted to punch out.

Bes, being a generally jovial individual, opted to excuse himself instead.
