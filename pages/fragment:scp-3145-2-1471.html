    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Item #:** SCP-3145

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All mobile devices on which SCP-3145-A is installed are to be confiscated and analyzed for potential leads to other infected devices. Afterward, devices are to have their batteries removed, be assigned a numerical designation, and be placed in Storage Unit-30 at Research Site-22.

All online stores for mobile device applications are to be monitored to prevent sales of SCP-3145-A. Devices suspected of infection are to be targeted with self-uploading malware and disabled until they can be retrieved by field agents.

**Description:** SCP-3145 is an image of a large humanoid figure with a canid skull and black hair that manifests in association with SCP-3145-A.

SCP-3145-A is a 9.8 MB mobile device application called &#34;MalO ver1.0.0&#34; available for free on various online application stories. SCP-3145-A has no listed developer and is able to bypass the approval process typically required by online stores before application distribution is allowed. SCP-3145-A cannot be removed from devices via program removal applications.

Installation of SCP-3145-A creates no icons or shortcuts. Instead, the program will send images via text message to the device it is on at a rate of one per 3 to 6 hours. Images will contain SCP-3145 visible somewhere within them.

During the first 24 hours after installation, these images will be of places frequented by the individual owning the device. After 48 hours, images will depict places recently visited by the individual. After 72 hours, images will show the individual in real time, with SCP-3145 visible in close proximity to the subject.

Individuals with 90 or more hours of exposure to these images will begin glimpsing SCP-3145 briefly in their peripheral vision, especially in reflective surfaces. Continued exposure will result in sustained, irreversible visualization of SCP-3145. Individuals at this stage of infection report SCP-3145 trying to communicate with them visually, despite being unable to understand or comprehend any message. Complete elimination of exposure to SCP-3145-A images is currently the only known method to reverse its effects. To date, no hostile activity regarding SCP-3145 has been reported.

**Addendum: Archival Document 3145-02**

&gt; //Note: This is a modified version of SCP-3145-A as posted on online application stores. It was discovered by Dr. Rie Falzon after her cell phone was found to be infected with SCP-3145-A. How the infection reached her phone is under investigation.//

&gt; {{Hey Doc, you there? Listen, this &#39;stalk people via their phones&#39; stuff is neat, I guess, but it doesn&#39;t go far enough, if you ask me. How about this: Let&#39;s say, after things get to the part where I&#39;m all sneaking up on them in real life almost, like the pictures with me right behind them, how about if they start getting scared and paranoid and stuff. And then, like, once they can see me in mirrors, if they keep looking, I&#39;ll eventually come out and spirit them away or something! I mean... I dunno, it&#39;s not super-exciting, but this is getting old fast. Just trying to spice things up. Anyway, let me know what you think! Absolutely NO ADS.  Enjoy!}}
