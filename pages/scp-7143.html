------------------------

Field Team A7 deployed on reconnaissance sweep of St. Thecla’s Middle School, Winesburg Ohio [[footnote]]School was closed in 2008 as part of parish merger; the property had not been resold by the time of the incident.[[/footnote]] after reports of suspicious activity made to local police are deemed sufficient grounds for investigation. The following events are compiled from agent testimony and body-camera footage.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
[A7 enters the building through the west entrance. Sweep of the west wing ground-floor reveals no anomalous activity. Team moves into east wing.]

[Field Team’s handheld Kant counter registers abnormally high Hume reading in room 104. Field team prepares entry.]
 
[Entry successful. Team finds a whiteboard eraser suspended 1m off the floor in the center of the room. No further anomalous activity present; local Hume measurements remain higher than standard range for scope of the anomaly.]

[SCP-7143 descends from drop ceiling; performs unarmed takedown on A7-4, snapping his neck and drawing the body down between itself and the other members of A7.]

[SCP-7143 draws A7-4’s service revolver.]

**A7-3:** “Wha-

**A7-2:** “He’s got a gun!”

[SCP-7143 propels A7-4’s body into A7-2, knocking him off balance, and springs toward agents.]

[A7-1 and A7-3 discharge firearms: bullets burst into flower petals before reaching target. Anomaly fires weapon, shooting A7-1 in the right kneecap.]

[Anomaly grabs A7-3 by the ankle and drags her to the floor. A7-2 pushes aside the body of A7-4 and attempts to ready firearm. Anomaly executes A7-2 and A7-3 via shots to the head.]

[A7-1 raises hands in surrender.]

[Anomaly shoots A7-1 in the left kneecap.] 

[Anomaly raises finger to lips in a “shh” motion, pats A7-1 on the head, and exits the scene.]

[A7-1 calls in recovery team.]
[[/div]]

Field Team A7 recovered without further incident. Cover story implicating local heroin trade as source of gunfire fed to police; no complications. Inspection of the team’s Kant counter indicates no hardware malfunction; subsequent sweep of the room indicates residual  traces of multiple Rosen-Fortune Bridges recently active in the room, though this is not sufficient to explain abnormal Hume readings. A7-1 placed on long-term medical leave. Whiteboard eraser demonstrates no further anomalous properties and is discarded.

Recovered security footage confirms eyewitness reports placing SCP-7143 as participant in the attack on Area-08. Anomaly is seen breaching primary security perimeter alongside Serpent’s Hand and Confederación forces. Corroborating survivor accounts, the anomaly is riding an unidentified theropod with gold-and-blue plumage. Corroborating survivor accounts, theropod is capable of expelling fire from its mouth. Corroborating survivor accounts, anomaly attacks Foundation security forces via generation of lightning from a tree branch in its possession.
