**Item #:** SCP-ZH-002

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** The item is currently uncontained. When a record of witness of item occurs, The Foundation should activate **Protocol MT. JADE**, along with the reacting procedures of natural disasters in The Foundation, and the extensive concerns toward the datas of Central Weather Bureau of Taiwanese Government. Details of **Protocol MT. JADE** are limited to personnel with clearance 4 or above. Personnel with the clearence below 4 should follow the Type IV and Type VII Response Code of Anomalous Entities and inform the associated Security Director of the nearest Site under the circumstance of witnessing the item.

**Description:** SCP-ZH-002 is an anomalous biological entity which presents basic thaumaturgic ability and divine radiation. SCP-ZH-002 has been confirmed, under morphological examinations, to carry at least 13 compartments and features of Taiwanese zoologic species. These characters include:

* The antlers of Taiwanese Sika Deer[[footnote]]//Cervus nippon taiouanus//[[/footnote]]
* The feet and hoof of Taiwanese Sambar Deer[[footnote]]//Rusa unicolor swinhoei//[[/footnote]]
* The V-shaped white streak of Formosan[[footnote]]&#34;Taiwanese&#34; in Dutch.[[/footnote]] Black Bear[[footnote]]//Ursus thibetanus formosanus//[[/footnote]]
* The fur prints of Formosan Clouded Leopard[[footnote]]//Neofelis nebulosa brachyura//[[/footnote]] and Leopard Cats[[footnote]]//Prionailurus bengalensis chinensis//[[/footnote]].
* The feather of Formosan Blue Magpie[[footnote]]//Urocissa caerulea//, a well-known crow-like bird with indigo feathers.[[/footnote]] grows out of the skin around scapula, along with the long tail feathers of Mikado Pheasant[[footnote]]//Syrmaticus mikado//[[/footnote]]
* The scales of Taiwanese Pangolin[[footnote]]//Manis p. pentadactyla//, a kind of mammal with scales, residing among southeastern Asia area.[[/footnote]] covering the hips and ankles
* The eyes of Taiwanese Macaque[[footnote]]//Macaca cyclopis//, a kind of monkey majorly living in islands of Taiwan and Japan.[[/footnote]]
* The ears of Taiwanese Flying Fox[[footnote]]//Pteropus dasymallus formosus//, a kind of huge bat with long snout like fox.[[/footnote]]
* The fang that matches the morphological traits of the ones on Taiwanese Wild Boar[[footnote]]//Sus scrofa taivanus//[[/footnote]]
* The streaks and spots of Sakura Hooked Salmon[[footnote]]//Oncorhynchus masou formosanus//[[/footnote]] show at the sides of torso of the item with significant humid surface.
* The coccygeal traits similar with the extinct species //Balaenoptera taiwanica// (Taiwanese Whale).
* The incisors of Taiwanese Field Mouse[[footnote]]//Apodemus semotus//[[/footnote]]
* Six forked tongues of serpents from unknown species.

Apart from the characters above, the item also has a transparent, straight, blue crystalline horn lengths 30cm on the forehead. The horn is confirmed to be the organ used to demonstrate thaumaturgic ability. The item also carries the divine radiation in the range of 130~533 akivas, and is classified into the category of Natural Divine Entities under the standard of Thesiologic Division.

SCP-ZH-002 has been witnessed for numerous times since 17th Century. The recorded date of emerge of the SCP item always corresponds to the date of one critical catastrophe in history of Taiwan. Currently, The Foundation has retrieved several documents associated with the SCP-ZH-002 entity from several historic groups of interest among different colonizing eras in history of Taiwan. It is highly suggested that the emerge of SCP-ZH-002 entity could be regarded as a sign, or at least strongly related to the occurrence of local catastrophes.

**Addendum ZH-002-1：An Extract of Retrieved Documents**

&gt;
&gt; **Extract:** The fractals of local documentation suggested that the ancient indigenous people: Taivoan People was aware of one kind of &#34;strange beast with antlers and long sapphire tail&#34;. They also implied that the creature somehow induced a massive landslide event by the bank of Ho-Ku River, causing casualties of the tribesmen. The disaster forced the Tapani Tribe of Taivoan People to migrate to where Yujing Township currently locates. Whether the unidentified entity was SCP-ZH-002, and whether the entity indeed induced the landslide event, are still under investigaion.

We saw a bizarre beast in the bamboo woods at the Dalivoe Village[[footnote]]The present Dounan Township at central part of Taiwan.[[/footnote]]. It glows blue, wearing rainbows, having antlers, leopard spots, scales, five to six long feathers, and rage looks of monkeys. The priest exhorted us to leave the village and inform the villagers to be aware, that the catastrophe is coming. While we ask for the reason, the priest replied: &#39;The creature being uni-horn beast, a symbol of the disasters from the heaven, we cannot defy it but refuge.&#39;
&gt; &#34;At the third night, lights emerged at the orion with the sounds of thunder. Shock waves attack the village soon, bringing countless toll. Fortunately, the priest had told us not to stay indoor at that night, hence the accident didn&#39;t occur on our fellows.&#34;

&gt;
&gt; &#34;On the next dawn, animals fled away from Plumpit, living stocks rioted. The land growled in a sudden and destroyed the buildings. ShuShu-In lost twelve personnels in the disaster, and Takahisa was punished. The creature seemed to be an ancient Yokai[[footnote]]Japanese supernatural creatures/existence. A synonym of &#34;ghost, demons and monsters&#34;.[[/footnote]] in Taiwan area. It usually shows up before big disasters and never be caught or tammed.&#34;

&gt;
&gt; Two days later, terrible quake demolished the Taichu and Shinchiku[[footnote]]corresponds to the present east-north part of Taiwan.[[/footnote]] Perfecture, leaving the toll of thousands. Though the Empire strongly helped Taiwan after the disaster, IJAMEA was busy on the affairs of expansion at South Asia[[footnote]]Here it refers to the Southeast Asia and Pacific area that Japanese Empire progressively expanded during 1930s to 40s.[[/footnote]], leaving no attention on capturing this Taiwanese anamolous animal. The plan is on hiatus until today.&#34;

[[/collapsible]]

**Incident Log ZH-002-13:** on 201█/██/24, the item is witnessed in a nearby forest field by an agent of Site-ZH-██. Site security directors send out MTFs in attempt to contain the entity, with few armed behaviors displayed during the action. The item demonstrated thaumaturgic ability and fled, failing the capture soon. It has been the █th time failure of ZH Branch to capture the item.

On the next day of the incident, explosive accidents occurred in two separate chemical industrial factories within a 3km radius of the incident location near Site-ZH-██. The 22th Containment breach of SCP-ZH-███ also happened on the same day. 47 deaths and 133 injured are recorded as a total toll number from these three &#34;misfortunes&#34;.

On 201█/██/05, an unknown message is sent to Site-ZH-██ with the vessel being a piece of  handmade, natural paper. The text is speculated to be manually written with the same fonts of Kangxi Dictionary. The author of the message is currently unknown. The contents of the message has been translated as below:
&gt; [[=]]
&gt; {{//FOUNDATION, Thy[[footnote]]speculated to be an ancient term of &#34;you&#34;[[/footnote]] want to imprison the descendant of the deity of mountain, forest and vital souls.//}}
&gt; {{//The spouse of Pong-Lai[[footnote]]a mythical land in Ancient Chinese folktales, which is an mysterious island located in the East China Sea. Pong-Lai could be a poetic synonym of Taiwan as it also locates east to China.[[/footnote]] has remembered. The karma circulates among all souls, and arrogation leads to only cruelty.//}}
&gt; {{//Thee[[footnote]]supposed to be a pronoun of deity beings.[[/footnote]] shall return, thy shall never forget. Thee is the spouse, until the day when the terra sinks.//}}
&gt; {{//— ████████//}}
&gt; [[/=]]
The necessity of containment of the item is currently under re-discussion of Command Three Enclosures[[footnote]]Command Three Enclosures, short of Three Enclosures, is the highest administrative group of ZH Branch, with the clearance equal to O5.[[/footnote]].[REDACTED]</textarea></pre>
