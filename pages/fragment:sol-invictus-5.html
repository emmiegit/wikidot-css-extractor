It was collectively agreed upon by the Site-666 administrators that Mariah Carey’s //All I Want for Christmas is You// had been banned from the party’s playlist after last year’s containment breach.

So, Primrose collected a number of strictly instrumental holiday tracks. Each of them as varied and inclusive as possible, since she didn’t want anyone to get annoyed from the repetition common in holiday music. 

She baked cookies, provided eggnog, hung the branch of a parasitic plant above the doorway, and despite her own traditions, she decorated the entire break room with cotton-based fake snow. Even if the Earth’s sun would be going through its solar solstice right now.

But throughout all of her party planning, one thing had been on her mind the entire time.

Sheldon and Ansiel. 

It had been about seven days since their first date together. Most of the non-essential staff have taken the holiday week off, Sheldon included.

It was reasonable to assume that, since Sheldon and Ansiel spent every day this week together, they haven’t gotten sick of each other yet. Of course, Prim called regularly to make sure Sheldon was being taken care of; looking over a human was an astounding amount of work, after all. But, she knew Ansiel was more than capable of handling it.

She finally completed setting up the food platter when she got a text.

Prim stepped back before a rift opened in the middle of the room. In a few moments, Sheldon stepped through from the other side.

His hair was tousled, and he had big smile plastered on his face as he carried his suit jacket folded over his arm.

Ansiel&#39;s head poked out soon after. &#34;I&#39;ll see you for New Years, Sheldon! Love you!&#34; he said before he blew a kiss and dived back in.

&#34;Love you too!&#34; Sheldon waved goodbye as the portal closed, and turned to Primrose. &#34;Good to be home. I miss anything?&#34;

&#34;Not much, same old same old. Unlike you.&#34; The jackal smiled. &#34;How did you enjoy your vacation, Sheldon? You seem to be positively glowing. He kept you fed and hydrated, I hope?&#34;

&#34;I haven&#39;t felt this way in years. Thank you, Prim. And yes, he was the //perfect// host. Have you seen his pool? Lord.&#34;

&#34;We have. Quite a scene, no?&#34; Primrose picked up a platter of chocolate chip cookies. &#34;Would you like to be the first to try one? Adrian is making a trip for milk and spiked eggnog, if you wish to wait.&#34;

&#34;Oh? Think I&#39;ll wait. When do you think they&#39;ll be ba-&#34;

&#34;Hey, hey! Speak of the devil, they will appear.&#34; Sheldon was cut off by the imp in question, back to their typical 2ft nothing size and carrying two gallons of holiday dairy. &#34;Sheldon! Did you just get back? We&#39;re just wrapping up the party prep. Want a glass?&#34;

&#34;Of course.&#34; He said, walking over to the breakroom to fetch a plastic cup. &#34;I was just about to tell Prim about my time with Ansiel. We swam in the pool, discussed legal philosophy, walked by the beach, watched movies from multiple universes, we sat and just gazed at Greed&#39;s night sky together. It was... //wonderful.&#34;//

Adrian smiled, &#34;Heh, good to hear. Honestly, I&#39;m surprised you two did anything besides knocking boots for a whole week.&#34;

&#34;W-Well...&#34; Sheldon blushed and looked away bashfully.

Primrose giggled. &#34;We are happy for you, Sheldon. Really. I am glad the both of you managed to find some happiness together.&#34;

&#34;Thank you, Prim. You and Adrian both.&#34; Sheldon said, looking at his two infernal friends.

&#34;So, uh...&#34; Adrian began. &#34;Did ya sign anything? I&#39;m actually curious about that. Also, milk, or boozed eggnog?&#34;

&#34;Eggnog. And well... about that.&#34; Sheldon rubbed the back of his neck. &#34;Me and Ansiel talked about it after our first night together. It&#39;s obviously a really big decision, and to Ansiel&#39;s credit he was never pushy about it.&#34;

Sheldon continued. &#34;I was never religious growing up, but my //parents// were. They were about as conservative and traditional as they came. We had our disagreements, mostly about... well, the sort of people I&#39;m attracted to, but despite everything I loved them both dearly. When they both passed... I... well, I didn&#39;t start believing but I always hoped I could see them again someday. I think it&#39;s one of the reasons I still keep kosher.&#34;

Sheldon sipped his eggnog. &#34;Obviously, thanks to my tenure at the Foundation, I know that afterlives exist now and chances are my parents are up there waiting for me. Which makes things... //very// complicated for me currently.&#34;

&#34;Oh, Sheldon...&#34; Primrose sighed. &#34;I am truly sorry to hear that. I know I am not exactly an unbiased source but... Heaven is... well-&#34;

&#34;A fascist theocracy? Don&#39;t worry, Ansiel told me.&#34; He sighed and downed the rest of his eggnog. &#34;He also told me that Heaven would most likely make a play for my soul when I die. Their legal department is supposedly in shambles and they&#39;re willing to bend the rules hard if it means getting someone with actual skill up there.&#34;

Primrose grimaced. &#34;... Unfortunately, I think Ansiel may be correct here.&#34;

&#34;Yeah... I think so too.&#34; Sheldon said as he received another pour from Adrian. &#34;Ansiel... doesn&#39;t want to lose me and I don&#39;t want to lose him either obviously.  I&#39;m also not too happy about the idea of existing forever under a fascist theocracy. But... well...&#34;

&#34;Yeah, I know, buddy.&#34; Adrian hopped up on table to pat Sheldon&#39;s back. &#34;It&#39;s a big decision. There&#39;s //a lot// to chew on here.&#34;

&#34;Yeah... I told Ansiel I still have my whole life ahead of me, so we&#39;re taking it nice and slow. I know I&#39;ll have to decide eventually but... right now? I&#39;m just... //happy,// for the first time in years, I&#39;m actually really happy.&#34; Sheldon&#39;s smile returned as he drank from his second cup of eggnog. &#34;For once, I actually have something in my life beyond working until I collapse.&#34;

&#34;Fuck //yeah,// buddy!&#34; Adrian cheered and poured themselves their own cup of boozy eggnog. &#34;That&#39;s the holiday spirit, fuck all this death talk. Let&#39;s //enjoy// ourselves.&#34;  

Primrose smiled and nodded. &#34;Agreed, as you said this is something to consider for another time. For now it is time to celebrate. The party is expected to start in… Thirty minutes or so. Can we expect you?&#34;

&#34;You absolutely can.&#34;

----

Primrose certainly knew how to throw a party.

Good music, good food, booze, and a blind eye to good-natured, rowdy behavior. That&#39;s really all one needed to make a good office Christmas party. Sheldon learned that tonight as he stumbled drunkenly down the hallway to his office. Before he got home, he wanted to grab a few things from his office. It was actually a minor miracle that he was able to remember where his office was, given just how inebriated he was.

//I really should calm down a bit.// He thought, as he stumbled over to his desk. He only needed a few papers to take home, maybe a snack, but something caught his eye. A Christmas card. Black and gold.

He adjusted his glasses to take a look, and smiled. &#34;Merry Christmas, Ansiel...&#34; Sheldon said quietly.
