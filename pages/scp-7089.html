**SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:**
Per protocol, Provisional Outpost-7089 is to be maintained by agents as an operational self-storage facility in order to mask on-site Foundation activities. The wing containing SCP-7089 is to remain closed to civilian clients under the cover of &#34;long term refurbishment&#34;. As all non-anomalous storage units have been removed from the wing, the resultant space is to serve as an operations and living complex for on-site personnel.

SCP-7089&#39;s exterior is to be monitored via closed circuit camera surveillance in case of unauthorised civilian access. SCP-7089-1 is to be assigned a rotating guard detail at all times to accompany any research expedition and provide an immediate response to any alteration to the interior space.

Any proposed test involving SCP-7089 must be signed off on by the research lead, Dr. Frederick Munroe, then approved by Site-44 Director Carter before any action is taken.

**DESCRIPTION:**
SCP-7089 is a personal storage unit (number 7089) with an external footprint of 25 square feet, built into the ████ ████ Self Storage facility - hereafter referred to as Provisional Outpost-7089 - in ████████, Yorkshire, England. The interior of SCP-7089 exhibits an acute spatial anomaly wherein its size is many times larger than the exterior. Educated estimates place its size at roughly 140 square miles. As the interior layout changes regularly and does not correspond to linear spatial limitations, this value is subject to ongoing reassessment.

The interior of SCP-7089 - hereafter referred to as SCP-7089-1 - contains a storage facility of similar design to the external complex, though a lack of additional decoration and presence of reinforced internal structure and cutting edge [REDACTED] indicate its purpose for either private or military usage, rather than civilian.

------

**RECOVERY LOG 7089:**
SCP-7089 came to Foundation attention on 14th May 2028, following the filing of five (5) missing persons reports in connection with staff and clients of what would become Provisional Outpost-7089, then a privately owned self storage facility. Shortly after this, assets based out of Site-44 bought the facility via a shell company and dispatched first response MTF Psi-42 (&#34;Misfits&#34;) to investigate.

Following contact with SCP-7089 and confirmation of its spatial anomaly, Psi-42 received clearance to enter SCP-7089-1 for the purpose of recon.

//**Further Information:** Agents on-site were monitored from a surveillance van outside the structure, and from Site-44 by Psi-42 Commander Haley &#34;Hammer&#34; Wilson, who had been unable to lead the operation due to routine medical exams. Agent Wilson requested a line of communication be kept open.//

------

//[Transcript begins.]//

//Psi-42 have been inside SCP-7089-1 for ten (10) minutes. Agent Omen&#39;s body camera turns a corner to a hall of storage units similar to previous halls.//

**Omen:** Geez, this place goes on forever. You reckon we&#39;re past the city limits, yet?

**Tyke:** Eyes forward, Omen.

**Omen:** Right, right...

//Two (2) seconds of silence.//

**Tyke:** ...And no, not //quite// yet.

//Light chuckling can be heard between agents. Agent Tyke can be heard sighing.//

**Tyke:** Alright, alright. Command, you still reading us?

**Hammer //(via radio)//:** We hear you loud and clear. I&#39;m being told it&#39;s //spooky// how well we can make you out.

**Wiz:** What&#39;s the catch?

**Hammer //(via radio)//:** None yet, but that means jack shit.

**Omen:** Wanna bet something&#39;s using the great reception to lure hapless shits in?

**Noble:** If it&#39;s another slimey, tentacled rat-bastard I swear to God...

**Tyke:** I&#39;m gonna try my luck on that. 

**Hammer //(via radio)//:** Noted. Keep your eyes open.

**Tyke:** Roger, ma&#39;am.

//Agents proceed further into SCP-7089-1. This transcript omits six (6) minutes of footage for brevity, during which time nothing of note is recorded.//

**Noble:** Shit...

**Tyke:** Do I wanna know?

//Agent Noble&#39;s body camera is facing a storage unit. The number above its door reads 2743.//

**Noble:** I&#39;ve seen that number before.

//Two (2) seconds of silence. Agent Tyke can be heard humming.//

**Tyke:** Come again, Noble? Where?

**Noble:** There! I mean, uh...

**Wiz:** ...Don&#39;t tell me, you saw it earlier?

**Noble:** Just after we came in, above the same door.

//Agent Noble turns. Their body camera shows three (3) units reading 7383, 134 and 1332.//

**Noble:** Those ones, too.

**Omen:** Wish my memory was that good...

**Wiz:** No pattern to them to notice. Weren&#39;t we going straight?

//Muttering can be heard between agents.//

**Tyke:** ...Crap. Hammer? We&#39;re being looped around! Probably some sort of closed space.

**Hammer //(via radio)//:** Knew it was too good to be true. Noble said she saw this place just after you came in. Can you see the exit from here?

**Wiz:** I see it, ma&#39;am.

//Agent Wiz&#39;s body camera shows the open unit door the agents entered through approximately 45 meters away. The hall of the non-anomalous self-storage facility is visible beyond it.//

**Tyke:** Not trapped, then, unless this place is playing for giggles.

**Hammer //(via radio)//:** Never know what&#39;s gonna happen with a non-linear like this.

**Tyke:** Ma&#39;am?

**Hammer //(via radio)//:** Pull out, Tyke. We can come back with proper mapping tech and save a //load// of hassle.

**Tyke:** Roger. Alright, folks, let&#39;s get gone. No sense getting lost when we&#39;re so close... to... Wait.

//Agent Tyke trails off. Both her body camera and others&#39; record her staring wide-eyed at a storage unit.//

**Tyke:** What... What the //fuck?!//

**Omen:** Tyke? You good?

**Tyke:** ...Yeah, I... It caught me off guard.

//Agent Tyke can be seen glancing at the other agents.//

**Tyke:** Please tell me you&#39;re all seeing this?

//Agents Omen, Wiz and Noble turn toward the storage unit.//

**Wiz:** Not sure what I&#39;m looking for, boss.

**Tyke:** The number above the door, Wiz.

**Hammer //(via radio)//:** I can&#39;t make it out from here, Tyke. What&#39;s--

//Agent Hammer is cut off by Agent Noble.//

**Noble:** Oh. Oh! That&#39;s, uh...

**Wiz:** More than a little invasive, yeah? But since when have these things ever cared for boundaries?

**Omen:** Too much to hope it&#39;s just a shitty coincidence, right?

**Hammer //(via radio)//:** Tyke, either get the heck out of there or get closer! I can&#39;t see what you&#39;re looking at.

//Agent Tyke moves closer to the unit. The numbers above it come into focus, reading 060699. Agent Hammer can be heard cursing (specifics unintelligible).//

**Hammer //(via radio)//:** ...Ah.

**Tyke:** That&#39;s my fucking //birthday//, ma&#39;am.

**Hammer //(via radio)//:** I&#39;m well aware. Non-Euclidean //and// telepathic. Command&#39;s gonna //love// this...

**Tyke:** We still pulling out?

**Hammer //(via radio)//:** I&#39;d say yes, but given the implied intelligence I think the researchers will to want a threat assessment before they go poking about in there.

**Tyke:** Not exactly ideal.

**Hammer //(via radio)//:** When is it ever?

**Tyke:** Alright, alright... Noble, Wiz. Either side of the door. If it&#39;s angry or has teeth, fill it with lead.

//Agents Noble and Wiz can be seen to nod, moving to flanking positions on either side of Unit 060699.//

**Tyke:** Omen, with me.

**Omen:** Of course we&#39;re opening the damn thing. It&#39;s only asked for you //personally//, at this point...

**Tyke:** Better us than another poor sod, right?

//Agent Tyke moves to the unit door, grasping the handle. Post-mission audio analysis registers the sound of a lock turning. Agents Omen, Noble and Wiz can be seen raising their firearms to ready positions.//

**Tyke:** You got my back?

**Omen:** Always.

//Agent Tyke can be heard taking a breath and counting back from five (5) seconds before pushing the unit door upwards. She takes six (6) steps backwards as it opens, raising her firearm. All body cameras take a moment to adjust to the limited light levels inside of the unit. Agent Noble can be heard gasping.//

**Noble:** ...Shit.

//Agent Tyke lowers her weapon.//

**Tyke:** Keep on alert, but... Maybe try not to look so threatening?

**Hammer //(via radio)//:** Tyke, report! What is it?

**Tyke:** Not what, ma&#39;am. //Who//.

//Agent Wiz&#39;s body camera adjusts to the lack of light. A pile of three (3) unmarked cardboard boxes are visible. Five (5) human figures are huddled together next to them.//

**Omen:** ...People.

//**Mission Debriefing**: On recovery, the individuals inside Unit 060699 were identified as accounting for all staff and client disappearances. After a full medical check-up, all were determined to be in perfect health with no lasting issues barring minor disorientation. As they lacked clear memories of the time between disappearance and recovery, minor Class B amnestics were administered.//

//The boxes recovered contained photographs identified by Agent Tucker as being from a family collection of her grandmother&#39;s.[[footnote]] Per her account, presumed lost in a house fire in 2023.

Following Psi-42&#39;s expedition, a long-term research group was assigned to Provisional Outpost-7089 to investigate SCP-7089-1. Psi-42 would remain on-site as support.

It was observed at this time that the unit number above the exterior door of SCP-7089 matched the number automatically assigned to it by the Foundation database. No evidence of tampering was detected.

**Munroe:** Agent Tucker, how would you describe your experience inside the anomaly?

**Tyke:** Disconcerting, sir, but hardly the weirdest thing I&#39;ve seen.

**Munroe:** Quite. Your assessment, Commander Wilson?

**Hammer:** Whatever intelligence is running the place //seems// benign, but we shouldn&#39;t assume shit about anything, really. 

//Commander Wilson coughs. Dr. Munroe can be heard sifting through papers.//

**Hammer:** Ideally, we need a plan.

**Munroe:** Several plans, I think. We&#39;re to take it one question at a time.

**Tyke:** Such as, sir?

//Dr. Munroe can be heard rising from his chair. The sound of footsteps follows, then a dry marker pen on a whiteboard.//

**Munroe:** Let&#39;s just start with one for now. We&#39;ll work from there. First off, intelligence!

**Hammer:** How smart it is.

**Tyke:** Or whether it means us harm?

**Munroe:** More the former, but if it&#39;s playing the long game to lure us, we //need// to know that as well.

//Dr. Munroe can be heard returning to his seat.//

**Munroe:** Also whether we&#39;re dealing with a genuine telepathic or precognitive entity. If we //are//, this first round of tests should determine //that//, as well.

**Hammer:** If that&#39;s the angle we&#39;re going for, then I might have a couple suggestions.

**EXPERIMENT LOG 7089-A:**
The first formal tests with SCP-7089 commenced on 22nd May 2028, focused on establishing a baseline for the level and manner of intelligence governing SCP-7089-1. These tests were also designed to determine whether the intelligence truly possessed telepathic, precognitive or any other form of pseudo-communicative psychic ability.

**EXPERIMENT LOG 7089-B:**
Testing resumed on 31st May 2028, following Site-44 Director Carter&#39;s approval of Dr. Munroe&#39;s adjusted approach to questioning. Tests were initially focused on opening a line of communication with SCP-7089 - predominantly to assess potential hostility - through a simple question and answer style of experimentation. When the first of these tests (see //#7089.5//) proved that SCP-7089 - while capable of being direct - was prone to responding with symbolism or recovered objects, the nature of questions shifted further to accommodate this.

An additional line of testing would be carried out in parallel by Researcher Townes on Dr. Munroe&#39;s approval. These tests were intended to determine whether objects recovered by SCP-7089 were created for purpose or relocated from elsewhere.

||~ Test No. ||~ Date ||~ Test Details ||~ Result ||
|| #7089.5 || 31/05/2028 || Dr. Munroe, accompanied by Agent Hammer, enters SCP-7089 while imagining a question, &#39;How big are you?&#39;. || Unit 140 encountered. One (1) laminated map of ████████ recovered with SCP-7089&#39;s location marked on it. City limits of ████████ recorded as provisional size for SCP-7089-1. ||
|| #7089.6 || 02/06/2028 || Researcher Townes leaves one (1) apple with a blue sticker on it in Dr. Munroe&#39;s office, then enters SCP-7089 while picturing it. || Unit 116125 encountered. Apple with blue sticker on it recovered. Apple vanished from Dr. Munroe&#39;s office the moment Townes entered SCP-7089. ||
|| #7089.7 || 03/06/2028 || Researcher Townes has one (1) apple with a blue sticker on it driven to ████████&#39;s city limits by Psi-42, then enters SCP-7089 while picturing it. || Unit 116125 encountered again. Apple with blue sticker on it recovered. Apple vanished from Agent Tyke&#39;s hand the moment Townes entered SCP-7089. ||
|| #7089.8 || 06/06/2028 || Researcher Townes has two (2) apples, with a blue and green sticker on them respectively, delivered to Site-44. After confirming their arrival, he enters SCP-7089 while picturing them. || Unit 116125 encountered again. Apple with blue sticker recovered, while apple with green sticker is not. Blue apple vanished from the loading dock outside of Site-44 the moment Townes entered SCP-7089, while green apple - in Site-44 biological storage at the time - was still present when checked. ||
|| #7089.9 || 07/06/2028 || Dr. Munroe enters, carrying a note reading &#39;Who are you?&#39;. || Unit 7089 encountered. Set of four (4) crates of contents-coded MRE ration packs recovered. Code numbers are arranged inside the unit to read &#39;7089&#39;. ||
|| #7089.10 || 08/06/2028 || Dr. Munroe enters while imagining a question, &#39;Do you mean us harm?&#39;. || Unit ██████ encountered. Photographic evidence of [REDACTED] recovered. See //Incident Report ████/140528//, attached below. ||
|| #7089.11 || 10/06/2028 || With approval from Site-12 Director Durrani, Researcher Townes enters SCP-7089 while picturing [[[SCP-1230]]]. || Unit 1230 encountered. SCP-1230 not recovered, still on Director Durrani&#39;s desk at Site-12 when checked. ||
|| #7089.12 || 11/06/2028 || With approval from Site-12 Director Durrani, Researcher Townes requests SCP-1230 be temporarily moved off-site. Townes enters SCP-7089 while picturing SCP-1230. || Unit 1230 encountered again. SCP-1230 recovered and returned to Site-12. 1230 vanished from its off-site storage location the moment Townes entered SCP-7089. ||

After Test //#7089.12//, experimentation would again be put on hold as Dr. Munroe - responsible for devising test parameters for SCP-7089 - was called to Site-44 for a quarterly review of his research. The review was without issue and testing was scheduled to resume upon his return to Provisional Outpost-7089 on 15th June 2028.

Prior to this, the below described containment breach attempt would occur at Site-44.

[[div class=&#34;alert_incident&#34;]]

//Florence Wing// (Asst. Director of Containment, Site-44)
//Dr. Frederick Munroe// (Research Lead, PO-7089)

------

**Incident Summary:**
At 1454 local time, SCP-████ would attempt to breach containment at Site-44 by exploiting an undetected weakness in its containment chamber. Though significant damage was inflicted to the chamber - necessitating extensive repairs and SCP-████&#39;s temporary relocation - a rapid response by the Site-44 Defence Force was successful in recontaining the entity with minimal injuries and zero (0) casualties among personnel.

**Post-Incident Analysis:**
The neutralisation of SCP-████&#39;s breach was enabled by material recovered in tests performed with SCP-7089 by Dr. Frederick Munroe. During Munroe&#39;s quarterly research review, Site-44 Asst. Director of Containment Florence Wing recognized elements in photographs recovered in Test //#7089.10// pertaining to [REDACTED], allowing for an accurate prediction of when SCP-████ would attempt to breach containment.

This allowed a response force to be prepared twelve (12) hours before the attempt was made.
[[/div]]

Due to the importance of SCP-7089 in detecting a potential containment breach, its Disruption Class would be upgraded from Dark to Vlam as a precaution. Dr. Munroe would return to Provisional Outpost-7089 one (1) day early on 14th June 2028 on the grounds that testing to determine the motives and limitations of SCP-7089 was vital to its containment.

//**Sender:** Florence Wing// (Asst. Director of Containment, Site-44)
//**Recipient:** Dr. Frederick Munroe// (Research Lead, PO-7089)

//**Clearance:** Level 3//

------

Director Carter has recommended to the O5 Council that we proceed with further testing on SCP-7089 immediately, and so far there&#39;s been no stated objections. Given we can now be certain it is - as a baseline - self-aware, precognitive and unable to remove objects from inside Foundation sites, determining further what we can glean from it and what its intentions are //must// be a priority from here onward.

We //need// to know whether this box is actually trying to ingratiate itself or whether it just wants our guard down. That first kidnapping to get our attention aside, it&#39;s done nothing even remotely hostile, and going by your reports on those keepsakes and intel, it&#39;s actively attempting to make us //like// it, the unhelpfulness of its unwillingness to communicate in //words// aside.

Put simply, you have a blank cheque for whatever you need on this one provided you run it by Carter first, though he&#39;s probably going to want to write up a few questions of his own.

You have our ear on this, Fred. Don&#39;t waste it.

**EXPERIMENT LOG 7089-C:**
Following extended planning, testing with SCP-7089 resumed on 17th June 2028, two (2) days later than originally scheduled. Tests would first consist of a series of questions intended to improve intel regarding SCP-7089, or regarding how SCP-7089 would view itself. After this, the previous lines of research would continue, with a view to understanding what SCP-7089 was and was not capable of.

Following //#7089.20//, Agent Wilson would write the following memo:

[[div class=&#34;alert_bulletin&#34;]]
//**Date:** 28th June 2028//

//**Sender:** Haley &#34;Hammer&#34; Wilson// (Commander, MTF Psi-42)
//**Recipient:** Florence Wing// (Asst. Director of Containment, Site-44)

//**Clearance:** Level 3//

------

After discussing it at length with Munroe, we are recommending that further scrutiny be given to SCP-7089 and the tests we perform with it before additional actions are taken.

Between my gut feeling and the evidence its responses have given us, I have little doubt now that SCP-7089 wants to be on our good side. It //wants// us to like it, between the shows of good faith, not stealing shit from inside secure facilities - if it even //can// - and //other// matters.

You know my family history, Wing. What we lost in service. You //know// what that photograph means to me.

What I have doubts of is //why// it feels the need to ingratiate itself if it knows we don&#39;t care. //Why// it needed our attention in the first place when it could have just as well skirted under the radar. It&#39;s //sapient//, can see the future, pull matter from anywhere - even the //future//, apparently - like it&#39;s nothing, store pretty much anything securely within it and seems to have a mentality designed to be cryptic but fundamentally //comprehensible//.

After the picture of the safe, I&#39;d almost say it wants [REDACTED].
[[/div]]

Testing with SCP-7089 would once again be suspended per Agent Wilson&#39;s recommendation, pending another full review of its motives. On 30th June 2028, the O5 Council would convene for a routine meeting, among which SCP-7089 was one (1) subject among a number discussed.

//[Transcript begins.]//

**O5-2:** Next order of business. SCP-7089.

**O5-6:** That&#39;s... the sapient self-storage unit, correct?

**O5-2:** It is, and the testing with it has revealed some... //interesting// details about it. I assume you&#39;ve all read the report?

**O5-8:** Its attempts to ingratiate itself haven&#39;t gone unnoticed, cryptic as it is.

**O5-4:** Are we certain it&#39;s not setting a trap? Forgive my apprehension, but vague responses and a gut feeling aren&#39;t something to draw a conclusion on.

**O5-2:** Certain. I&#39;ve cross-referenced the data gathered from the anomaly with [REDACTED]. At the very least, it&#39;s on the level.

**O5-6:** And purpose built. Whomever sent it back knew what they were doing.

**O5-11:** At this point I can only assume most of us have reached a similar conclusion on that point.

**O5-2:** Which only leaves us needing confirmation from SCP-7089 itself that our assumption is correct. I have the question written up already, so I move to approve.

**O5-8:** At this juncture, the clarity would be welcome beyond the minor risk still remaining.

//Logs indicate the motion passes with only one (1) council member opposing and two (2) abstaining.//

**O5-2:** That settles the matter, then. I will contact Director Carter once this meeting is adjourned. Now, what was next?

On 10th July 2028, normal containment and research operations at Provisional Outpost-7089 would resume. By O5 order, test parameters would now restrict directing specific questions to SCP-7089 without O5 approval, though other forms of testing would continue uninterrupted under Dr. Munroe. With provisional containment complete, MTF Psi-42 were reassigned to assist in the containment of SCP-████ on 14th July 2028, as part of operations to pare PO-7089 back to only necessary personnel.

Barring logging of testing or changes in its status, no further updated documentation is required on SCP-7089 for the foreseeable future.

All information pertaining to the classified status of SCP-7089 as Thaumiel is prohibited from being shared with personnel below Level 5. To this end, any individuals not immediately necessary to research were removed from contact with SCP-7089 upon this assignment and relocated to other ongoing operations.

This included the entirety of MTF Psi-42 (&#34;Misfits&#34;), whose commanding officer, Haley Wilson, has been barred explicitly from making inquiries into the reasons for her task force&#39;s transfer.

[[tab EXPERIMENT LOG 7089-D]]
The following tests took place on 3rd July 2028, under the direct order and oversight of the O5 Council. Per instruction, Dr. Frederick Munroe (Lead Researcher, Provisional Outpost-7089) was instructed to carry in the question referred to in Test //#7089.21//, the results of which led to SCP-7089&#39;s immediate reclassification as Thaumiel and a follow-up clarification in Test //#7089.22//.

||~ Test No. ||~ Date ||~ Test Details ||~ Result ||
|| #7089.21 || 03/07/2028 || Dr. Munroe enters SCP-7089 carrying a note reading &#39;Who built you?&#39;. || Unit 1 encountered. Object 7089-T1 recovered. See //Recovery 7089-T1//. ||
|| #7089.22 || 03/07/2028 || Dr. Munroe enters while imagining a question, &#39;Can you verify this?&#39;. || Unit 1 encountered again. Object 7089-T2 recovered. See //Recovery 7089-T2//. ||

On 10th July 2028, normal containment and research operations at Provisional Outpost-7089 would resume. By O5 order, test parameters would now restrict directing specific questions to SCP-7089 without O5 approval in order to mask the specific attributes of SCP-7089 from agents without clearance. Other forms of testing would proceed uninterrupted under Dr. Munroe, who as part of continued operations would recieve Level 5 clearance to work with SCP-7089.

Under the guise of provisional containment being complete and paring back to only necessary personnel, MTF Psi-42 were reassigned to assist in the containment of SCP-████ on 14th July 2028. Factually, Agent Wilson&#39;s presence and the possibility of her learning of Tests //7089.21 through 22// was considered a hazard to continued stable containment (refer to //Recovery 7089-T2//).

[[div class=&#34;alert_bulletin&#34;]]
//**Date:** 11th July 2028//

//**Sender:** Dr. Frederick Munroe// (Research Lead, PO-7089)
//**Recipient(s):** Overseer Council//  (SCP-O5)

//**Clearance:** Level 5//

------

While I recognize the removal of Commander Wilson and her task-force from contact with SCP-7089 as a necessary step towards continuity of containment and have no objections to file from a logical standpoint, I&#39;d like it on record that I find the decision to keep her in the dark to be an excess of caution. Hammer is a loyal agent, and her family&#39;s service to this organization speaks for itself. What we&#39;ve uncovered here would //not// change that.

I will abide by the decision, as it isn&#39;t my place to question, but I&#39;m sure you know better than I do that Wilson won&#39;t like this when she inevitably finds out, even if she understands the reasoning. It seems like an unnecessary complication, to me.
[[/div]]

Barring logging of testing or changes in its status, no further updated documentation is permitted on SCP-7089. This is unlikely to change for the foreseeable future.

SCP-7089&#39;s attempt to offer its services as a containment site is pending a full O5 review of the matter, but should be answered no later than 2035 to ensure optimal usage of the facility should a motion involving it pass.

//**Log No.** 7089-T2A//

//**Clearance:** Level 5//

//**Involved Agents:**//
//Haley &#34;Hammer&#34; Wilson (Commander, MTF Psi-42)[[footnote]] Due to the nature of this file, notation on the position of this agent may be inaccurate. [[/footnote]]//

//**Further Information:** Deep-scan audio analysis has verified the speaker in this file as Agent Wilson. Agent Wilson and MTF Psi-42 (&#34;Misfits&#34;) were assigned to SCP-7089 prior to its classification as Thaumiel. Mnestic therapy has shown her to have no memory of recording this message, reducing the odds of it being fabricated.//

//As a result of the information contained in this file, Psi-42 was reassigned away from SCP-7089, and were excluded from permissions to access Level 5 documentation on the anomaly. To maintain stability of containment of SCP-7089, future actions taken regarding it and matters of temporal continuity, the O5 Council has ordered that this state of affairs continue until it is no longer necessary.//

------

//[Transcript begins.]//

//The sound of a microphone being adjusted can be heard for five (5) seconds. The whine of a ceiling fan is audible.//

**Hammer:** Okay, third time&#39;s the charm. Better not fucking cut out, this time.

//The shuffling of papers can be heard.//

**Hammer:** Long time no see, Fred. Or whoever. With how much red tape the O5s threw at this thing, I never got a clear answer on who actually finds this, though I can guess when. Makes sense now, but damn if that wasn&#39;t annoying.

//Three (3) seconds of silence. Agent Hammer can be heard sighing.//

**Hammer:** Date today is... Fourth of June, 2089, for whatever keeping track of that even means, these days. Only a month til Independence over in the States, though even God doesn&#39;t know if there&#39;s anyone left who&#39;d feel like celebrating it. I know //I// never did, as much time as I spent stationed over there.

//Two (2) more seconds of silence.//

**Hammer:** When I got dragged into running this project - this //department// - I don&#39;t think it clicked straight away what exactly it was we were making. I had more than enough clearance even back then to have all the //facts// set out in front of me - how it worked, when we needed to be ready, so much other useless crap I barely remember now - but I think it was only in the third year I made the connection.

//Agent Hammer can be heard chuckling quietly.//

**Hammer:** Summer of &#39;74, Ninth Occult War right around the corner, and all I could think about was a little self-storage unit more than six decades in my past, a stone&#39;s throw from where my grandfather used to live. Another life even at that point, with all the shit the spooks pumped us full of to keep our hearts going. You wouldn&#39;t believe by looking at me that I&#39;m past ninety.

I went back, you know, after I put the pieces together. Took a jeep and went cross country, told the Director it was recon. Still don&#39;t know how I managed to sell that, with how messed up the world was starting to get.

But it wouldn&#39;t have mattered: Entire city was ash by then, along with most of the county. No sign of the unit. Guess you found a way to move it at some point, but Carter was never going to tell me where you or it ended up. Still won&#39;t, really.

//The shuffling of papers can be heard again.//

**Hammer:** I think you&#39;re still out there, sometimes. Comms are patchy, so I wouldn&#39;t even know if you were in the next town over, but you knew what was coming better than most of us. If anyone&#39;s gonna weather this shitstorm, it&#39;d be you. Not like there&#39;s anybody else left I haven&#39;t already got a bead on. Not Omen, not Noble... //Definitely// not Wiz...

There&#39;s... not many of us here at 44, now. A lot of the effort this side of Europe&#39;s moved out to 54. They need most of the remaining personnel - few of us that there are now - to keep the lights on. Can&#39;t remember how long ago it was they dragged Wing over there.

So that just leaves Carter, myself, a handful of technicians and field agents... and Tyke.

//Agent Hammer can be heard laughing again, louder now.//

**Hammer:** Don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without her. Baffles me how she stays so positive through all this shit, but I don&#39;t begrudge it. Makes the days easier on all of us.

//The ceiling fan in the background can be heard briefly stuttering.//

**Hammer:** This place is coming apart. Haven&#39;t had the resources for proper upkeep for //years//. Had to put it all into the project. Only a matter of time before we have to join up with Durrani&#39;s lot at Site-12. The box comes before that, though.

I know you&#39;ve worked it out by now, but it&#39;s one of ours&#39;. Emergency containment. Handy little intelligence stuffed in a pocket space. Don&#39;t ask me how it works, you&#39;ll have more than enough time to study the thing. They just wanted me to oversee the project, but it&#39;s been ready now on our end for a long time, now, and we&#39;re almost out of time to send it back.

Because the world is //well// past the brink. No sense us firing the thing up again this late on when you&#39;ll get far more use out of it.

//A creaking noise can be heard, assumed by context to be Hammer leaning back in her seat.//

**Hammer:** Anomalies are multiplying by the day. We have more corpses than agents, and those of us still alive are stretched thin. We had //decades// to prepare for something like the Ninth War, but I still don&#39;t think we were //ever// going to be ready. The box was meant to be a safety measure, to make the war easier on containment, but I don&#39;t think that was //ever// what it was actually intended for.

Not that it matters either way. With everything spiralling, now, it&#39;s only a matter of time before something gives and I have to write a risk assessment for a //Tenth// Occult War that no-one will ever read. 

//Five (5) seconds of silence.//

**Hammer:** Do you think they //knew//, Fred? That it&#39;d get this bad? The O5, I mean. They&#39;ll be hearing this, too, so they //had// to, right?

//Agent Hammer can be heard breathing deeply.//

**Hammer:** Or did you already know, Two? Made your plans based on some inevitability. Maybe you thought you could avoid it, or outlast it. Even now that&#39;s above my paygrade, not like I&#39;ll ever know, and it wouldn&#39;t affect my loyalties either way. The Foundation runs too deep in my blood - in my //family// - for that. But... make this worth it, alright? Find a way through the madness.

If you&#39;re still out there, fix this. Make it right, I&#39;m //begging// you.

//A light thudding sound can be heard, followed by Agent Hammer sobbing.//

**Hammer:** Because otherwise all this was for naught, pointlessly prolonging a world that&#39;s godless and hollow.

Left to fend off the rats for scraps.
