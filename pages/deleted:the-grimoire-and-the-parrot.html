Max Gonzalez sat in the passenger&#39;s seat of the Foundation specially-armored van as he looked back over what he had so far in his draft, probably the fifth or sixth time just that day alone. Who knows how many times he had gone through it in total; this was going to be his first SCP object documentation, and each time he looked closely, he found something to change almost immediately…

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**__Special Containment Procedures:__** SCP-5257 is to be contained in a standard anomalous item containment unit at Site-51, unless undergoing direct testing and research or for a biweekly review to catalog any changes of its contents. 

Any new research proposals outside of current standard practices or requests for experimentation with specific occult rituals and practices outlined within SCP-5257 must be submitted to Demonics Department Administration or to --either SCP-5257 head researcher Dr. Damien Kaplowicz or to deputy head researcher Max Gonzalez directly.-- 
[[/div]]

“Why did I feel the urge to call Damien and myself out like that, what good does that level of random specificity possibly do?” Max muttered to himself as he crossed out the final line and replaced it.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
…outlined within SCP-5257 must be submitted to Demonics Department Administration or to --either SCP-5257 head researcher Dr. Damien Kaplowicz or to deputy head researcher Max Gonzalez directly.-- SCP-5257 research staff.
[[/div]]

“This is what Damien was talking about, knowing what details actually matter to someone who would end up reading the file in an emergency, and needing to quickly know what they need to…” Max knew he was butchering Damien’s actual quote, but he was pretty sure that had basically been the gist of it.

“Sorry, what was Damien talking about?” Cassie Jackson asked next to him as she turned down the old school country from the radio that she so loved (and that Max so eagerly tuned out on drives like this by hyper-focusing on literally anything else). 

“Huh? Oh sorry, I was just talking to myself I guess; didn’t really realize I was thinking out loud,” he replied.

Cassie chuckled. This definitely wasn’t the first time she’d seen him get so engrossed in some banal little research task for whatever he happened to be assigned to at a given time. Max could endlessly wax poetic about the ‘joys’ of conducting anomalous research, even the minutiae like proper documentation or the intricacies of adjustments to some methodology he was enacting, and yet he almost invariably seemed “stressed out of his tits” (as she liked to describe it) whenever she actually witnessed him doing his work, no matter what that work actually was.

“Of course, shoulda assumed,” she replied simply. She glanced away from the empty road ahead to look over at Max typing something into his laptop, and knew he had already tuned back out. She might have been a little offended if it had been anyone else, but instead she just amusedly rolled her eyes and turned them back to the road. They were almost at Site-51 anyway. 

Max had indeed tuned out already, if he had ever really fully ‘tuned in’ in the first place. He was already apprehensively going over the next section of his partial object file draft. 

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**__Description:__**
SCP-5257 is a grimoire believed to have been written sometime in the late middle ages or early renaissance period in Europe; in many respects, SCP-5257 superficially resembles many pieces of similar European occult literature from this time period, such as the artistic style and --focus of text-- textual focus on various occult and demonological practices, histories, folklore, and --similar information-- so on.[[footnote]]More detailed summary of SCP-5257’s contents can be found in Addendum I.[[/footnote]] However, exact dating is difficult due to the book’s anomalous property of autonomously modifying its own text, with --seemingly random frequency-- no readily apparent pattern in regard to the frequency of such changes. 

The periodic self-induced changes in SCP-5257’s text make exact dating and origin-tracing difficult and imprecise. These changes have been observed to occur with varying frequency since its procurement by the Foundation, and understanding of the exact --causes-- catalysts and mechanisms by which such textual changes emerge remain poorly understood. Incidentally, such unpredictable content deviations have rendered any significant level of historical specificity to be at least somewhat unreliable. 
[[/div]]

Max finally went through the first couple paragraphs of the description without immediately finding anything to adjust (or any previous adjustment to revert), until the last sentence of the second paragraph at least. He thought over that sentence for the //who-knows-how-many//-th time, relitigating his own worries of whether it was too broad and/or confusingly worded. In the end though, like each time before, he moved on simply because he couldn’t quite think of a better alternative.

//Just because I haven&#39;t thought of one yet doesn’t mean there isn’t one,// he thought to himself with chagrin. His attention to detail was a big reason he had been given this assignment and an accompanying promotion to Senior Researcher after only a few years in the Department of Demonics (though he pointedly resisted the urge to overthink the potential irony of how he couldn’t quickly pull to mind an exact count).  

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
The object itself has been determined to be almost entirely made out of human biological material, primarily skin, which constitutes the material basis of both the parchment used to form the pages and the binding of the book itself, which has been treated and crafted to resemble regular leather. Other examples include book-binding cord composed of human sinew and a unique ink solution, **which chemical analysis has shown to consist primarily of human blood, as well as trace amounts of other bodily fluids and an additional unknown substance which appears to function as a preservative.** --Its-- This material’s role, if any, in the anomalous shifting of text throughout the SCP-5257 has yet to be determined.
[[/div]] 

He marked the penultimate statement and left an accompanying note to himself to check back in with Gerard to see if chemical analysis had turned up anything else yet after his interview session with [[[SCP-5601]]] before he submitted a final version.

He involuntarily shuddered. Max’s mind filled with a mix of excitement, dread, and anxiety whenever he thought about the upcoming ‘interview’ he would be conducting with an //actual demon//… in his time with the Department of Demonics so far, he had never directly seen or interacted with a demonic entity any more powerful than a lowly imp, and even that had terrified him at the time. He&#39;d only narrowly avoided being drafted [[[SCP-6566]]] duty last week, ironically because the Department decided he&#39;d need the time to prepare for this final part of his current assignment and related transfer to Site-51. 

Cassie often poked fun at his perpetually nervous demeanor, calling him the ‘least courageous employee in the whole department’ or some variation thereof. He usually responded with something like ‘bravery is a requirement for you containment specialists; for researchers like me it’s just a nice bonus.’ Max was aware, of course, that a naturally nervous person like himself that couldn’t so much as sit through //The Exorcist// as a grown-ass man hardly fit the expected archetype of a demonology expert. He suspected this was in large part due to his penchant for overwhelming morbid fascination with malevolent creatures, myths, and folklore outweighing even his admitted tendency towards constant fright and anxiety. 

“You’re a senior researcher now, dammit, and there&#39;s important work to be done!” he said, chastising himself while pulling his mind away from that unproductive tangent of existential worry and self-doubt.

“You sure are Maxy” Cassie laughed beside him; he blushed as he only then realized he’d started thinking out loud again.

-----

Cassie and Max arrived at Site-51 soon after and got out of the van just as their required escort pulled in behind them. Connor Lin, another containment specialist, quickly got out of the van and trotted over to them. “Alright let’s see it!” he said excitedly.

Cassie and Max turned to regard him with bemusement and bewilderment, respectively. “I was actually planning to make sure to remind you and Lane to keep your distance… You got the excerpt detailing this book’s effects that I sent everyone before we came over here, right?”

Connor pulled out his terminal and dramatically began to read in what Max was about 70% sure was //supposed// to sound like a fancy, educated British accent. “Other anomalous properties include a faint red glow visible at all times regardless of light level, a prevailing sense of dread or unease imparted on any individuals who remain in close proximity for more than a few minutes, and lasting frequent nightmares or even waking hallucinations of horrific and violent scenes or images.” 

“Don’t forget the footnote: //Both anecdotal reports from staff and D-Class testing has shown that the exact timeframe and intensity are correlated to an individual&#39;s propensity and history of violence and/or highly antisocial behavior, with higher levels leading to muted emotional effects and an extended period of proximity necessary to trigger in the first place.//” Max replied.

“The inverse is also true, and a hippie-dippie extrovert that’s just aggressively nice to everyone he meets well past a fault is going to be particularly vulnerable to those effects.” Cassie bluntly finished for Max.

“Don’t worry, I read that part too,&#34; Connor responded cheerily, &#34;I’m just willing to risk it for the chance to see the creepy fleshbook of spells and demons. Seriously, like 30 seconds, tops.”

Cassie saw Max huff and look like he was thinking about what could convince their recklessly optimistic coworker to back off for his own well-being. She just shrugged and pulled out the Mobile Anomalous Secure Transport Unit and input the unlock code. As Max finally opened his mouth, appearing to have finally formulated a satisfactorily measured and rational response, Cassie preempted him with an “Alright, your therapy sessions,” and pulled out the drawer to show Connor. 

“Woah, nice! Man, you weren’t kidding about the impending sense of doom or whatever. Is it normal to vaguely hear guttural, indecipherable chanting from all directions at once?” Connor asked a sputtering Max.

“Wh- Cassie, what the Hell… That- You can’t just... I mean, protoc-” he started before Cassie cut him off.

“He asked a good question Max, is that normal?”

Max just looked back and forth between a relaxed Cassie and an obviously fascinated but horrified Connor, shuddering as he started to reach his hand out to actually open the damned thing. Max reached out and quickly closed the drawer again before Connor actually reached it. “No it’s normal, I’ll add it as a potential side effect for further study.”

A now pale-faced Connor smiled and turned to Max. “Oh, well I g- guess you’re, you’re welcome then… Glad to, uh, to help!” 

Max let himself fantasize about decking Connor’s stupid, now-almost-bloodless face as he took the MAST Unit from Cassie, and started walking with it to the Site entrance.

**__History:__** 
SCP-5257’s classification as an SCP object resulted from an internal operation conducted by the newly-established Department of Demonics in January of 1994, shortly after that department’s establishment following its predecessor’s (the Department of Tactical Theology’s Demonics Division) split and promotion to full department status seven months prior. In order to more adequately understand and secure anomalies already within the purview or possession of the Foundation that may involve demonic influence, especially after the events of [REDACTED], Department Director Lionel Van Hamersveld initiated re-inspection of Safe-Class SCP objects and uncategorized [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/log-of-anomalous-items-vol-iii anomalous objects], from which SCP-5257 was identified as a candidate for further research and eventual reclassification.

Dr. Alaina Ibrahim re-read the short dossier she’d been sent regarding Site-51’s newest anomaly, knowing that sfor most of it, she had just skimmed at best the first time around. In her own defense, there had been a lot of objectively more urgent and pressing matters on her plate over the past couple of weeks… and years… 

Alaina shook her head and took a gulp from her third cup of coffee of the day. “//We die in the dark so that…// Yada, Yada, Yada. At least death was restful.

She tried to force her attention back to the document at hand, on the new Demonics Dept. artifact being moved into Site-51 custody for the foreseeable future, barring unforeseen circumstances. She needed to understand the object so she could foresee as many possible circumstances as possible; that was one of her primary roles as the Department’s containment chief at one of, if not THE most concentrated centers of demonic anomalies.

She had initially been surprised that such an ostensibly low-risk object was being transferred to this site, especially where it seemed that some pretty fundamental research was still ongoing as to the basic properties of the anomaly itself. It’s not like the Foundation had a habit of liberally transferring unpredictable objects of reality-warping power all willy-nilly without very good reasons. Also, the inherent dangers of concentrating too many demonic entities and artifacts in small areas was also a very purposeful tactic, and why even in a hub of Demonics department research and administration like this, a site only contained so many such anomalies at any given time. To do so for what was effectively //cross-testing// purposes still struck her as somewhat reckless and unnecessarily risky, even if one of the anomalies involved was something like the uncharacteristically cooperative SCP-5601. Demons were still demons, and were NOT beings one usually wanted to depend on any hypothetical good intentions of, should any Unforeseen Circumstances arise.

She’d raised her concerns initially of course, had them considered by her superiors, and seen them promptly dismissed anyway. The best she could do now is minimize risks and keep a watchful eye on the upcoming consultation procedures. She took another large gulp from her mug, and silently chastised herself for letting re-reviewing the plan fall through the cracks of her busy schedule. Alaina once again attempted to force her wandering mind back to the documents in front of her, this time with more success. Where had she been… 

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
The revisit of studying SCP-5257, and its eventual full classification as an SCP object, were primarily motivated by the discovery of additional anomalous properties which were not identified during initial procurement and inspection, foremost among them being the aforementioned penchant for textual self-modification, as it was discovered that archives of transcribed portions of the item’s text no longer matched its then-current contents (This was further confirmed by an incident where text underwent a minor but noticeable change at some point during inspection). Of special note was the at-times significant changes to sections of the fourth and final part of the tome, the text of which now seemed to include a new paragraph which seemed to allude to SCP-5257’s own containment:
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
//Codex was found by the finders of what can&#39;t or shouldn&#39;t be found. The nature of the journey has shifted, but the role still yet to be played by Codex in the game of reality has only been amplified. Forgive them not, for they know enough of what they do.//’

Note: “Codex” is the term consistently used by SCP-5257 to refer to itself, always capitalized and always without any preceding article. Due to this fact, and due to the occasional usage of the base Latin term in English, the moniker has been left in its original rendering, sans any attempted or literal translation.
[[/div]]
[[/div]]

Well, that was somewhat ominous, but about in line with what she would expect from an anomalous grimoire made of parchment and leather derived from human skin, which outlined rituals of dark magic and how to call upon demons. She moved on to the penultimate section of the document. 

**__Contents:__**
SCP-5257 is divided into four parts of varying subject matter and propensity for anomalous modification. An overview of each is provided as follows: 

[[div style=&#34;display: block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px&#34;]]
[[=]]
**__PART I:__** Occult History and Overview
[[/=]]
**Subject Matter:** Historical anecdotes and broader overviews of various occult practitioners, as well as descriptions of certain gnostic and pagan religious groups along with their beliefs and activities,[[footnote]]This includes at least three historical groups previously unknown to Foundation historians and anthropologists, of which two have since been confirmed elsewhere.[[/footnote]] and a broader assortment of proverbs, metaphors, myths.
**Notes:** The most varied and meandering section, as well as the one which has so far appeared the most subject to unpredictable self-alterations. Though some accounts and historical descriptions have been confirmed through alternate sources, other parts contradict many of the same sources, and still other segments can not be easily verified or debunked. The lattermost category is especially true of modified sections, both in their past or present iterations.
[[/div]]
[[div style=&#34;display: block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px&#34;]]
[[=]]
**__PART II:__** Demonology
[[/=]]
**Subject Matter:** Demonological information and information relating to the usage of demonic entities in various occult and thaumaturgic acts. An ever-changing number of specific demonic entities are called out and described, with varying similarities to descriptions from other, non-anomalous medieval grimoires.
**Notes:** At least as many specific accounts and details from this section appear verifiable or supported from other trusted historical sources known to the Foundation as the previous part, at least in comparison to falsifiable or suspect information. However, a much higher proportion of information is novel, and hard to determine the accuracy of using other currently available records and sources. 
[[/div]]
[[div style=&#34;display: block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px&#34;]]
[[=]]
**__PART III:__** Thaumaturgic Spells, Rites, and Rituals
[[/=]]
**Subject Matter:** Instructions for various thaumaturgic rites, rituals, and workings, with primary emphasis on practices relating to what can broadly be classified under traditional perceptions of “black magic”; i.e. curses and hexes, necromancy, summoning of extra-dimensional entities, especially demonic ones. 
**Notes:** Almost two-thirds of workings and rituals from this section that have been attempted in testing have either yielded no results or sometimes-wildly different results than was described. Whether this is a result of accumulated mutations to the item’s text up to this point, commonly inaccurate or ineffectual initial descriptions of such workings being present from the beginning, or some combinations of the two has not been determined, but is a subject of ongoing study.
-----[[/div]]
[[div style=&#34;display: block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px&#34;]]
[[=]]
**__PART IV:__** Self-History
[[/=]]
**Subject Matter:** By far the smallest section, this part appears centrally focused on recording past events relating to the item itself from its creation and journey through various occult practitioners over the past several centuries, to anomalous events caused by its keepers and readers along the way, to its recent acquisition and containment to by the Foundation. 
**Notes:** In some ways structured more as an epilogue than a full part equal to the other three. Due to the primary usage of cryptic and highly figurative language, this section remains the most poorly understood at this time. This is also the only section in which new modifications are added without replacement of any existing text.
[[/div]]

Alaina had to admit to herself, reading through the documents a little more carefully this second time made her feel a //little// more understanding of the reasoning behind the proposed consultation with SCP-5601, and its ultimate acceptance against her own protests. It was also just occurring to her that, while never explicitly stated, one major reason behind the permanent relocation of SCP-5257 to her site might have to do not with carefree disregard for the dangers of transporting anomalies from site to site, but a measure of caution by not undertaking a second re-relocation back to the object’s initial home unnecessarily, even if there was no evidence of sapience, sentience, or ability to self-transpose in any way. Still, she should have realized that sooner, rather than assuming the reasoning to begin and end with making any further ill-advised demonstrations to SCP-5601 more accessible, she thought. Why hadn’t she thought of that sooner? It didn’t really matter in the end, but still, she ought to be sharper than this.

Alaina Ibrahim quietly directed an unkind epithet at herself, as she found herself doing more and more these days. She absent-mindedly pulled her mug to her lips, only to find it completely empty. She swore again, but resisted the urge to immediately refill it. She knew from experience that at a certain point, the caffeine would stop mitigating her exhaustion and just make her jittery and irritable while still remaining just as tired, and if anything she may have crossed that threshold already. Alaina knew she could make do and pull through, as the corny cat poster she kept on her office wall reminded her; she lied to anyone who asked by saying that the poster was ironic, but in truth, the words gave her some small bit of renewed spirit in times like these, as silly as it seemed.

She turned back to read the last section before going to meet the arriving research and containment staff, SCP-5257 in tow. Luckily, she knew this last part well, as she had read this part at least multiple times already, especially when she was trying to nix the idea in the first place. Still, a refresher couldn’t hurt, she thought.

**__Research Proposal:__** This proposal centers on furthering the useful but limited progress already gleaned from consulting with the demonic entity known as SCP-5601 or “Phenex”, a uniquely knowledgeable source of knowledge on demonological matters who nonetheless has expressed in recent, remote sessions that they can only be of limited further assistance in deciphering and interpreting the text of SCP-5257 without close physical proximity and observation. The potential value in the information contained within SCP-5257, on topics including but not limited to: 
* The origin, creator(s), and exact intended purpose of SCP-5257 itself; 
* The means by which SCP-5257’s contents are altered at unpredictable rates, as well as any factors that determine (or at least influence) what modified text becomes as a result of such changes;
* Specific details of particular demonic entities which are suspected to be recently or currently attempting to influence baseline reality via anomalous means;
* The veracity and implications of the current hierarchy of demonic entities as described within SCP-5257; 
* The extent by which they, as quasi-thoughtforms,[[footnote]]Also referred to as //pseudo-thoughtforms// in some literature, such entities are not generated or fully ontologically influenced by the collective thoughts, beliefs, and actions of more ontologically elemental or “grounded” sapient beings, (i.e. humans and the human noosphere[[/footnote]] have their ranks and power influenced by collective human philosophical and sociocultural perceptions; and 
* Confirmation or Refutation of several current prevailing and/or significant theories and conjectures as to the nature of Demonic entities, such as the Hartford Conjecture of bidirectional noö-ontological causality or the Walden-Glyman Many-to-One Model of multiversal overlap. 

Though it has been acknowledged and considered that there will always be some level of inherent risk in assuming honesty on SCP-5601’s part and in acceding to their stipulations for gaining further insights, SCP-5257 research staff have come to the conclusion that the risks are minimal given factors such as the established history of cooperation with the Foundation, the proven alignment of each party’s interests in regards to Foundation research goals and SCP-5601’s continued safety and security, and the well-fortified containment measures in regard to SCP-5601 in conjunction with the lack of any evidence or indication that SCP-5257 poses any major threat by its own contents and limited anomalous properties.

Alaina Ibrahim suddenly noticed her left eyelid twitching involuntarily, and couldn’t decide whether it was the excess caffeine or the brazen assumptiveness of that last statement; perhaps both. That line of reasoning, faulty by her estimation, was one of the major points of contention with the proposal which she had honed in on in her original dissent to the proposal in the first place. It was clear that this little research project had not been based on any major input by containment specialists in complement to pure researchers, despite the clear containment vulnerabilities in the proposed course of action. She rolled her eyes and just continued reading.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
In conclusion, when considering the potential risks and rewards, SCP-5257 staff is confident that this opportunity presents a positive opportunity to better understand the Foundation’s knowledge of not just SCP-5257 itself, but applicable demonology as a broader discipline and… 
[[/div]]

//Blah blah blah,// Alaina thought, hardly even caring any more than she was only half-reading this BS proposal. 

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
…dangers can be mitigated through reasonable measures including the observation of experienced demonic containment specialists, The establishment of extra thaumaturgical runes, wards, and sigils to temporarily strengthen local resistance to demonic influence even further, the application of Metzinger protocols for…
[[/div]]

Alaina just put the document down at that point, out of patience. She already knew the rest anyway, since she’d been in charge of actually implementing the measures, inadequate as she found them. She got up, made herself another cup of coffee, and then ventured out to meet her new burden and its caretakers.

Max looked around Site-51 with at least a little bit of awe. The place was built like a massive fortress to his eyes, with archaic runes and sigils that he couldn’t begin to decipher decorating walls and doorways that otherwise reminded him of a maximum-security prison. He had to admit to himself, the atmosphere was more than a little intimidating. 

He glanced ahead while reminding himself that these halls were not the important parts of the facility, to himself at least. Obviously, the interior design of the research and residential wings were not going to be built as high-security chambers for otherworldly beings, and it was silly to judge his new workplace by its most foreboding sections, sections which he would rarely ever half to enter or pass through himself.

//My new workplace,// Max repeated in his mind. He supposed the reality hadn’t quite set in. when he and SCP-5257 Head researcher had begun formulating their proposal (and, honestly, even once they’d finished and submitted it), Max hadn’t actually expected to be accepted, not really. It’s not that he didn’t believe it should be, personally. It was just that such proposals had a rejection rate well above 50%, and he was hardly an unbiased source to begin with, as a newly-promoted researcher in his first senior role; a deputy head researcher at that, even if it was for a small team handling a Safe-Class, only recently promoted A.O. 

From her demeanor and terse conversation, Max got the sense that the gruff Demonics Department Site Containment Lead had similarly doubted the viability of Max’s SCP-5257 research proposal. Max didn’t get the sense that Dr. Ibrahim meant to seem cold or even realized she was doing it; hells, for all he knew, she was just like this by default. He still doubted that resentment towards having to set up and oversee an operation she deemed poorly-conceived wasn’t at least a large part of what was going on, especially after asking Cassie and receiving just a short “yep, seems like it”, despite Max having anticipated the usual counter-interpretation and blunt, detailed picking apart of his initial intuition that he had come to expect (and rely on) from his best work friend. 

Or, maybe he should just think best friend at this point; it’s not like it was especially easy to consistently maintain normal outside friendships when working for one of the most insular and secretive organizations in human history. He’d been able to hold on to a couple himself even after the bulk of a decade in Foundation employ, but certainly not to the level of closeness he’d shared with them prior to joining the Foundation. 

They finally reached SCP-5601’s chamber. While Max was at least in theory aware that the demon was trapped in the body of a normal gray parrot, he was still somehow kind of underwhelmed when walking into the SCP-5601’s containment chamber and seeing the modestly sized tropical bird which served as its host. It hardly made for an imposing figure, at least superficially, so he didn’t know what he’d been subconsciously expecting.

##RebeccaPurple|”//Your fears fail to come true, yet you stand there crestfallen?
You’d prefer blood and viscera in my feathers, like a bee covered in pollen?//&#34;##

Max involuntarily leaped back the eerie, child-like voice parroted by the demon that seemed to be answering his unspoken thoughts. //Maybe it had been…/// Max thought.

##RebeccaPurple|”//Indeed it was, my shuddering young scholar; 
Perhaps if myself or my cage, was a tad wider and taller?//&#34;##

“I just didn’t…know what to expect. I’m glad to see you’re in a good mood though.” Max tried his best to present a ‘dignified, unshaken senior researcher’ demeanor that he’d been secretly practicing in those periods where his rare downtime coincided with his not-at-all-rare general anxiety.

##RebeccaPurple|”//Practice makes perfect, when given enough time; 
A bold man you could be still, with only a few extra lifetimes//&#34;##

Max immediately shot back with unhidden annoyance, “You&#39;re one to squawk, you eldritch poultry! Eons of unlife, and you’re the best you can do is to pretend ‘time’ rhymes with &#39;lifetimes&#39;!”

Dr. Ibrahim frowned on one side of Max while Cassie snorted from his other. “Oh, what are you laughing at?” Max turned irritatedly to his overly-amused friend; part of him immediately regretting lashing out at her as he finished his angry retort, though another part of him being secretly glad for the diversion from… whatever that demonic parakeet was doing, reading his mind and who-knew-what-else. 

Cassie, cavalierly unoffended by his bout of thoughtless rudeness as usual, breezily explained, “I was honestly hoping something like this would happen. I actually bet with Connor that you’d find some way to get bullied by the little bird demon.” 

“Hey, I just said ‘bullied’ was too specific, and I maintain that this isn’t quite ‘bullying’, per se,” Connor blithely responded.

Max blushed as his brief remorse for snapping at Cassie dissipated, replaced by a familiar, vague sense of embarrassment. //Fuckin’ dick…// he thought to himself, now wishing he’d been harsher if anything. 

##RebeccaPurple|”//Why, Is one not enough engagement, must you keep another nearby? 
Perhaps learn to use the first, before giving managing another a try.”//##

Cassie turned to look, an inquisitive smile on her face. “Tell you later,” Max responded to her unspoken question, finally beginning to regain his composure, and pointedly ignored the irksome bird.

Around then, Dr. Ibrahim cleared her voice. I would have //hoped// that a senior researcher of demonology would not be so vulnerable to the petty chidings of a trapped demon in a parrot&#39;s form.

Max, though chagrined, took the criticism without a word. He knew it wasn&#39;t entirely unfair, after all. Thankfully, SCP-5601 didn&#39;t butt in with any grating poem or quip either this time.

&#34;... As for //you,&#34;// she continued, pointing at SCP-5601, &#34;You&#39;ve never shown any ability to read minds as far off as the entrance to your chamber, at least not overtly. Care to explain?&#34;

##RebeccaPurple|”//An explanation you want, then one you shall receive; 
The tome you bring here holds power, Power for which you remain naïve.//&#34;##

The demon proclaimed in its signature carefree, juvenile tone.

“The enlighten us,” Cassie said, as she marched, SCP-5257 and its MAST unit in tow, toward the rusty birdcage etched with innumerable wards and glyphs that even Max had trouble recognizing the majority of, but assumed were virtually all for either holding or weakening of the demon’s anomalous capabilities and powers. &#34;Here’s the stupid book you’ve been so cryptic about so far.&#34;

##RebeccaPurple|”//Cryptic, me? Why, I couldn’t speak clearer;
There&#39;s only so much I can do, through your fancy little mirror.//&#34;##

“Enough, you know as well as any of us what cameras, video footage, and screens are,” Dr. Ibrahim said while rolling her eyes. Max wondered while seeing it if these kinds of conversations happened a lot between the two.

##RebeccaPurple|”//More or less I’ll admit, but I must have fun somehow; 
So little to do in a cage, I must make the most of this now.//&#34;##

Max walked up beside Cassie, deciding to ignore the intrusive answer to the question he’d silently asked himself, and himself alone. “Well SCP-5601, Let’s start with the obvious question; how and how much does the mere proximity of this random spellbook increase your resistance to your thaumaturgic seals and glyphs?”

##RebeccaPurple|”//Modestly and no more, for that I can assure you;
Though ‘random’ the tome isn’t; indeed, what a find you’ve bumbled into.//&#34;##

Max ignored the not-so-subtle-jabs again. “What do you mean, that this grimoire holds some particularly special significance?”

The demonic bird was actually quiet for once, as it continued its first in-person (or rather, in-parrot) review of the object it was being shown, as it nodded at Cassie to turn the pages every few seconds. This went on for at least a minute before Dr. Ibrahim, who also looked surprised at SCP-5601’s uncharacteristic silence, opened her mouth to say something only for the demon to finally cut back in.

##RebeccaPurple|”//This dread tome does not feel, quite how I would expect;
Energies vaguely familiar, yet, just how I still can’t quite detect.//&#34;##

“Well, let us know if you figure it out. In the meantime, let’s go over a couple of recent textual alterations,” Dr. Ibrahim replied. “Researcher Gonzalez, what were some of the main specific sections for which virtual appraisal and decipherment would not suffice?

“Um, yes, well… I suppose the first but we can go over the auto-historical description. In your virtual sessions, my colleagues indicated that you did not recognize the exact thaumic mechanism being utilized?&#34;

##RebeccaPurple|”//Perhaps a fresh look,
at this less-than-fresh book...//&#34;##

Max fought the overwhelming urge to roll his eyes and simply turned SCP-5257 to its fourth section.

##RebeccaPurple|”//Aha, yes indeed, now they don&#39;t quite escape my sight;
The runes of glowing darkness, hidden in the light.//&#34;##

&#34;...runes of glowing what n--&#34; Max started, before the demon suddenly continued.

##RebeccaPurple|”//The runes of unlight complete the subtle scene;
So complex, years would it take to explain what it means.//&#34;##

&#34;For real? Ugh ok, nothing can ever be simple... let&#39;s just come back to that part,&#34; Max replied as he looked back to his notes. &#34;Let&#39;s see what&#39;s next… Ah. Kind of similar, actually; in the demonological section…” Max quickly turned through the book, trying to ignore the deep, unnatural dress that was already seeping into his mind. “...you&#39;ve expressed that a few of the specific entities were not real to your knowledge, but there were also four or five you were more unsure of, saying something along the lines of, ‘These seem wrong, like they&#39;re missing something.’ So we figured, perhaps something wasn’t transferring through the video for whatever reason. What do you see now, does it still seem incomplete?”

The demon said nothing for what felt to Max like too long a time, but he kept his mouth shut and waited.

##RebeccaPurple|”//This tome is much more ancient than you suspect;
Yet no older can I allow it to get.//&#34;##

“What do you mean by that?” Dr. Ibrahim asked, a hint of suspicion in her voice. 

##RebeccaPurple|”//Oh do worry not Alaina, I’m about to shed some light; 
Please turn to page 53, if memory serves me right.//&#34;##

Max glanced over at Dr. Ibrahim, slightly unsure, but she gave a curt nod, so Max turned to the requested page. He wondered what was in that particular section of the grimoire that pertained to its own true age (it wasn’t even in the self-history section, but rather one detailing spells and rituals), or wherever else the demon was going with this. Max supposed he was about to find out.

The eyes of the possessed parrot in front of him locked on the bottom-left of the page for a moment. Max started to bring his head forward to glance at which particular working SCP-5601 was investigating, when the possessed bird began muttering something in a much lower voice than normal, something Max couldn’t quite make out.

“What was th--&#39;&#39; Max started, before being cut off by the sensation of the book leaving his hands, and he stared in bafflement as SCP-5257 rose to levitate a good four to five feet above him. “Wait...” Max started again, only to be once more interrupted, this time by the deep roar and the searing heat that suddenly erupted in an outsized plume of fire coming out of that small parrot body in front of him, like some industrial-grade flamethrower.

Everyone watched in shock as SCP-5257 was consumed right there in the air, completely obscured by the blinding inferno now completely engulfing it. Max saw out of the corner of his eye as Dr. Ibrahim began to quickly pull something out of her jacket pocket when an overwhelming sense of crippling dejection flooded his mind so strongly, so comprehensively, that Max involuntarily dropped to his knees and could think of nothing other than his newfound unimaginable, crippling despair. He suddenly wanted nothing more than to cease existing, to never have to think or do or say anything ever again, and this desire was the only thing he even felt capable of desiring anymore.

Those few seconds from that moment until the dread psychological pall was suddenly lifted, just as the infernal flame bursting forth from SCP-5601’s mouth like a dragon ceased just as suddenly. Though the supernatural sense of doom was now gone, Max couldn’t hardly form a coherent thought. The closest he got was //maybe I should take a moment to collect myself…//, before then fully falling over to the ground in a heap. His reeling mind barely even noticed. 

-----

Dr. Alaina Ibrahim forced herself to push through the cascade of smothering emotional and mental influences that had just assaulted her brain like a tsunami. It took all of her past training, focus, and remaining mental resolve to pull herself from that brink of temporary madness in short enough order. She pushed herself off of the old birdcage she’d leaned against almost involuntarily a few seconds ago, and glanced at those around her to take stock. 

As her remaining brain fog cleared, she noticed that most of her colleagues had dropped to their knees, to a full-on fetal position, or even just crumpled into moaning and/or weeping heaps on the containment chamber’s floor. //Ok//, she thought, //something definitely just happened. You need to figure out what it was, and quickly!// Then the realization hit her. //No…// she thought as she turned first to look at SCP-5601, and then followed its black eyes to the pile of glowing ashes on the ground just in front of that new researcher’s glassy-eyed, prone form. 

She stared back at SCP-5601, who had now turned to look back at her with a characteristically unreadable stare. Her usually iron-willed discipline and patience escaped her for just a moment. “WHAT IN THE EVERLIVING FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?!” she screamed at the small caged bird hosting the ancient, powerful malevolence that had just incinerated another anomaly of its own ancient (apparently), powerful malevolence.

##RebeccaPurple|”//With myself? Very little, or very much by some views; 
But my oath to you, Alaina, that was a relic none should use.//&#34;##

“You… you... Preening, sniveling, little…” Alaina Ibrahim started, but stopped herself soon after, and took a deep breath or five as those around her watched in mute shock, at least those who had finally begun to collect themselves after the psychoemotional onslaught that had just wrenched through their very beings. She knew she needed to be careful here, and rash outbursts were rarely the key to good post-incidental containment or disaster mitigation tactics. 

“You should really elaborate further, Phenex. For the sake of all of us.” Dr. Alaina Ibrahim said more diplomatically, even using the entity&#39;s preferred name; in part to just slightly soften the edge of the not-so-vague threat that immediately followed (but too much). 

##RebeccaPurple|”//Elaborate, I cannot, for all of our sakes, I guarantee;
Some things are best left unknown, this was a gift to all of thee.//&#34;##

The demon paused briefly before continuing: 

##RebeccaPurple|”//Ungratefulness I understand and forgive, even as a token of my goodwill, I spared the one who presented; 
Even faced with the joyous prospect of roasting human, ‘twas more important that the banished one’s return be prevented.//&#34;##

The damned thing’s little poems were getting longer; Alaina knew from experience that it was being as serious as it ever got. She sighed and pressed her fingers to her now-pounding temples. She was going to need to discuss and coordinate with a LOT of other Department senior staff over... Whatever just happened, what to do about it, and what to do about SCP-5601. //Speaking of…// she thought to herself, how did the demon break through all the weakening and binding wards necessary to even **do** that?//

##RebeccaPurple|”//I&#39;d already cast counter-wards, workings I read from that very codex; 
Perhaps I would have even tried my talons at escape, had I had any safe place to go next.//&#34;##

The childish voice began, once again answering her mental question. It soon continued:

##RebeccaPurple|”//Alas, I know no such area, so for now I remain and assist, 
Especially for the danger inherent to my kind, but know this: 

“There are dangers lurking in existence for which even we demons remain wary; 
‘Tis not my fault that you alone cannot seem to determine the danger you aim to carry.//&#34;##

This was getting nowhere, Alaina knew, but she kept pushing. “That&#39;s not a lot of help you know, how are we supposed to avoid dangers we can’t know about or understand?”

##RebeccaPurple|”//My dear, those are ones you should avoid the most; 
But that does not mean their attention you should draw so close//&#34;##

Alaina was having more and more trouble curtailing her anger. “Draw what close, ‘this banished one’? How are we ‘drawing it close’? And how does not even knowing what gets its attention, or how to NOT get its attention help in the slightest?”

##RebeccaPurple|”//So many questions you have, and yet so little caution;
If my words of warning you will not heed, then perhaps the other option.//&#34;##

“WHAT other option?” Alaina asked, exasperatedly. No answer came this time as the possessed tropical bird stared back at her in mocking silence. “You can’t-- Son of a bitch. You know, for an incredibly ancient being, it’s not just your voice that&#39;s perversely juvenile.” She didn’t bother to wait for a retort that she knew would not be forthcoming anyway. Alaina turned to begin checking on her people. //One fire to put out at a time,// she reminded herself.

She noticed that the nervous researcher who’d been inquiring about the now-presumably-neutralized SCP-5257 had finally seemed to regain a modicum of awareness and composure, and just realized what happened. He let out a whimper when he saw the ashes of the biggest project of his career on the floor, after literally watching all his recent work go up in flames before his eyes. One of the containment specialists who came with him got down on the floor with him, apparently comforting him. Alaina made a mental note to insist on psych treatment for the poor lad, even if he ended up not being receptive to it. In the meantime… she began walking over to the two. 

-----

Cassie, once she felt she’d fully recovered her wits, walked over to her shell-shocked friend and colleague who still seemed to be in the middle of that particular process himself. Max knelt in the ashes of SCP-5257; the object of weeks of exhaustive work and research on his part, the catalyst to his recent promotion, that stupid little evil fucking spellbook that he could drone on about for hours past whoever was around to at least hypthetically listen had inevitably tuned out. 

&#34;It&#39;s… It&#39;s gone… Why? How? Wha… What just happened, Cassie?&#34;

Cassie didn&#39;t answer verbally, she just knelt down next to him and gave him what she hoped was a comforting hug. In truth, she didn&#39;t really know much of what had just happened herself. 

After a long few moments, as the rest of the Foundation staff present got themselves together and began variously exiting the chamber or discussing amongst themselves what to do next, Cassie decided to try her hand at a pep talk. She wasn&#39;t the best at those, but if it came from the heart...

&#34;You still have the scans of all the pages, remember? And you still have your fancy new title…&#34; Max didn&#39;t perceptibly react; Cassie tried again. &#34;You&#39;ll probably get an even better assignment now…&#34; she trailed off. This wasn’t helpful, she could tell, so she just went back to the silent hugging. 

Cassie began to make a mental note to herself; //Make sure that Max talks to one of the therapists or something, perhaps some--//

&#34;Psych treatment would probably help,&#34; Dr. Ibrahim said, interrupting/finishing Cassie&#39;s own thoughts. &#34;I&#39;ll make sure to have someone arrange it, but in the meantime, there&#39;s still important work to be done. I need you to draft up an incident report. I&#39;ll go over it when you&#39;re done, but you were the most involved and the most knowledgeable here on what all led to this.&#34; 

Dr. Ibrahim was obviously talking to Max now, and Cassie found herself irritated at the gruff woman who was already barking out orders to the traumatized man mourning months of his work at her feet. Cassie was about to give a potentially reprimand-worthy retort before Max beat her to an answer: &#34;Of course Dr., I&#39;ll have it for you by tomorrow evening at the latest.&#34;

Cassie turned back to look at her surprisingly steely-voiced friend. &#34;Are you sure Max? I don&#39;t think any //sane// person would fault you for needing a little break after everything that&#39;s happened…&#34; she risked a glance up at Dr. Ibrahim standing beside them. If the containment lead had caught Cassie&#39;s subtle jabs, she was ignoring them.

&#34;Yes, I&#39;m sure. There&#39;s still work to be done,&#34; Max proclaimed. Then, a little more softly, &#34;I&#39;m fine, I really am. Will I… still be maintaining my new assignment at this site? Even now that the reason for my relocation was just incinerated in hellfire?&#34;

Dr. Ibrahim gave a slight smile and shrugged. &#34;I&#39;m sure that will be evaluated by Department administration, but I&#39;ll work on the assumption that you are until I hear otherwise.&#34;

Max began to get up. &#34;Alright, fair enough. I want to know why whatever just happened, well, happened the way it did anyway. Also,  I appreciate the offer, but I think I&#39;m fine; I don&#39;t need that psych eval.&#34;

&#34;Well I disagree, and you&#39;ll be getting one anyway,&#34; Dr. Ibrahim replied and began to walk off. 

Max and Cassie just turned to watch her as she did, both unsure of what to say, but Dr. Ibrahim broke in again as she was walking towards the exit, without turning back. &#34;Nice to meet you two, but I have other fires to go put out.&#34;

//Hopefully they won&#39;t be quite as literal this time,// Dr. Alaina Ibrahim thought to herself.
