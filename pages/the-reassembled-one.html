[[size 150%]] **Qabil** [[/size]]

[[&gt;]]
**The Reassembled One, Master of the Church of the Broken God, Son of MEKHANE, [[footnote]] While &#34;Broken God&#34; and &#34;MEKHANE&#34; refer to the same entity, &#34;MEKHANE&#34; is used by members of the Devout and in written papers. &#34;Broken God&#34; is a colloquialism coined by outsiders of the faith.

**Conspectus**
[[/=]]

Revered as the Son of MEKHANE, Qabil was an important figure during the War of the Flesh [[footnote]] While historic sources had cited the invaders as &#34;Sea People&#34;, that may be a misnomer derived from records of early battles that took place in port cities. [[/footnote]] in the late Bronze Age. Although he died in battle once, he was later reassembled as a divine miracle of MEKHANE. Reassembled and augmented, Qabil was tasked to reassemble MEKHANE and triumph over the Flesh. 

Since the end of the Bronze Age, Qabil secluded himself from the world. In recent times, he is awakened to a world that has forgotten MEKHANE. Despite that, Qabil seeks to complete his mission and prepare for the Day of Reassembly. [[footnote]] The Day of Reassembly is believed to be the day where MEKHANE is reassembled to His glory and the Flesh is permanently destroyed. [[/footnote]] To that end, alongside the thirteen-member Apostle Overwatch, they founded the latest incarnation of the Devout: The Church of the Broken God. [[footnote]] The term &#34;Church of the Broken God&#34; was originally coined by news media, which ultimately became the official title for the organisation. [[/footnote]]

**Knowledge**
[[/=]]

**Traits:** Qabil&#39;s appearance is that of a male human in his earlier thirties, standing at about 1.8 m tall and weighing about 80 kg. His limbs and spinal cord are replaced with bronze implants, grafted onto him during his reassembly. Engraved onto his forehead is the Design, a Piece of MEKHANE which contains an outline of MEKHANE&#39;s completed Form. 

Qabil has received an augmentation from MEKHANE that reflects any attacks directed towards him against his attacker, safeguarding him against the many agencies of the Flesh. In addition, Qabil gains pyrokinetic ability that allows him to manifest fire around him. 

Qabil also possesses a photographic memory, storing all canon knowledge regarding MEKHANE and the Flesh. He is regarded among the Devout as a source of knowledge and is the author of the Devout&#39;s Holy Writs. 

**Nature:** Qabil is known for his introverted disposition. He shuns the company of his fellows despite his influential role amongst the Devout, so management of everyday operations is left to the Apostle Overwatch. His only true priority is to reassemble MEKHANE, often relying on the Devout to retrieve His Pieces. Thus, he devotes all his time to reassemble MEKHANE.

**History &amp; Associated Parties:** According to the __Book of Designs__, Qabil was the firstborn child to Hawwa, who was impregnated by lightning. [[footnote]] Excerpt from the __Book of Designs__ Chapter 8: //16. And the craftsman Cedalion explained: &#34;Do not be afraid for what is conceived in you is from MEKHANE, who is Broken.&#34; 17. &#34;And you shall give birth to His Son and he shall make MEKHANE Whole.&#34;// [[/footnote]] In his youth, Qabil was initiated into the cult of MEKHANE. Skilled in blacksmithing, he grew to become a talented metalsmith. 

During the War of the Flesh, Qabil was among the many defenders to rally against the Flesh. Famously, he fought a duel with his half-brother, Habil the Betrayer. [[footnote]] Unlike Qabil, Habil the Betrayer is not born from MEKHANE. [[/footnote]] Although the duel ended in Habil&#39;s death, Qabil was mortally wounded and he too died not long after. 

Many mourned and wept at the passing of Qabil, but MEKHANE performed His miracle on the remnants of Qabil. The sky was cast in His tears and lightning struck upon Qabil&#39;s Broken body. Branded with His Design, Qabil was made Whole and arose. At the sight of the reassembled Qabil praising MEKHANE, he would be hailed as The Reassembled One. After that battle, Qabil was renowned as the founder of many cities, as described in Bronze 15:5-7. [[footnote]] Excerpt from the __Book of Bronze__ Chapter 15: //5. And the formerly great forests and all its greenery burnt unto ashes and dust. 6. And gave way to the flames evoked through His Son Qabil. 7. And once these formerly great forests no longer obstruct His Son, Qabil built for the righteous a sanctuary to safeguard the righteous from the horrors of the Flesh.// [[/footnote]]

At the end of the Bronze Age, Qabil secluded himself to recover from injuries and fell into deep slumber. He was awakened in the 20th century, where he roamed the land in search of modern successors to the Devout... only to find none initially. He took it upon himself to gather new followers to reassemble the Broken God, eventually founding the Church of the Broken God. 

Currently, Qabil leads this new incarnation of the Devout, and utilises the Design and his many followers to locate and secure the Pieces of MEKHANE. Under Qabil&#39;s leadership, the Devout strengthens day by day [[footnote]] Excerpt from //The New York Times//, dated 20 August 1991: From Soviet to Standardised, World&#39;s First Broken God state. [[/footnote]] and prepares for the Day of Reassembly. 

**Approach:** Due to multiple attempts of assassination by the Bookburners, Qabil is currently secured in the Seventeenth Forge, and protected by the Devout. High levels of security have deterred attempts to intrude the Seventeenth Forge, protecting Qabil from enemies and ensuring no hindrance to his mission. 

Due to Qabil&#39;s presence and mission, only Class 4 and above members of the Devout are allowed entry to the Seventeenth Forge. If any other individual wishes to seek an audience with Qabil, they must obtain approval from a member of the Apostle Overwatch. 

//While these measures appear to be a reaction against Qabil&#39;s enemies, he is essentially under house arrest. We do not know if that is truly Qabil&#39;s wishes or the Apostle Overwatch&#39;s.// ~ L.S.

**Observations &amp; Stories**
[[/=]]

Within the canon of the Devout, Qabil is the central figure in the __Gospel of Hephaestus__. Members of the Devout universally revere Qabil as a saviour, believed to be key to the reassembly of MEKHANE. It is believed by the Devout that they will be rewarded for the reassembly of MEKHANE on the Day of Reassembly, and become united with Him. [[footnote]] Excerpt from the __Book of Reassembly__ Chapter 53: //14. &#34;And all faithful followers of MEKHANE shall be regarded as His Sons and Daughters, and be in communion with Him.&#34;// [[/footnote]]

The __Threat Entity Database__ of the Bookburners consider Qabil and the Devout as a Severe Threat, probably due to their influence on many devotees worldwide and the Bookburners&#39; fear that they be judged for their many crimes in the world to come. In addition, it is treated as a Demi-divinity, perhaps in acknowledgement to Qabil&#39;s divine origins. Even so, it appears that the Bookburners have the boldness to dare challenge those that they know are righteously on the side of (the Broken) God. [[footnote]] //Such is the hypocrisy of the Bookburners, for these mortals acknowledge the existence of superior beings and yet delude themselves that they can nullify said superior beings. Laughable.// ~ אהיה [[/footnote]]

The __Testimonial of Maxwell__ is highly critical of Qabil, condemning him of limiting WAN [[footnote]] A term used by members of the Maxwellist heresy, typically referring to MEKHANE. However, the Devout dispute the term and do not acknowledge the term &#39;WAN&#39; as an acceptable referent to MEKHANE. [[/footnote]] as a physical entity. Maxwell writes Qabil as a deceiver whose possession of the Design is false and illogical. He reasons that WAN&#39;s Reassembly cannot rest upon the shoulders of one entity, when it should rest on all followers and believers of WAN. 

The __Revised Record of Theological History__ takes note of the etymological similarities between Qabil and the Arabic translation for &#39;Cain&#39;, and repudiates the Devout&#39;s stance that the supposed first murder is divinely justified. [[footnote]] In the Devout&#39;s canon, Qabil&#39;s slaying of Habil is not regarded as the &#34;first murder&#34;. The __Revised Record of Theological History__ insists that the Devout deems it as such. [[/footnote]] Instead, the __Revised Record__ holds that the Devout are a death cult glorifying murder and manslaughter, centred on the worship of the Biblical Cain and the disembodied corpse of Abel that he slew and misappropriated as an object of worship. [[footnote]] //For the record, it is the __Revised Record__ that is misappropriating theological history. Seriously, did the authors do their research at all? Abel as an object of worship? They clearly do not know that guy&#39;s true colours// ~ Seth ben Adam [[/footnote]] This claim is bolstered by the Devout&#39;s use of violence to resolve conflicts such as the Scrapping of the Maxwellists [[footnote]] //The Scrapping was justified. The Maxwellists attacked the Devout first. They merely responded in kind.// ~ C.O.G. [[/footnote]] or Moscow Standardisation Crisis. [[footnote]] //Equally justified. The Standardised Union officially declared the Church of the Broken God as state religion to be practiced by all its citizens. Violators of this law are merely given their just punishment, as per the Standardised Union&#39;s Constitution.// ~ C.O.G. [[/footnote]]

**Doubt**
[[/=]]

It is speculated that Qabil himself had warped the Devout to suit his interests, whatever it may be. Proponents of this allegation highlight Qabil&#39;s authorship of the Holy Writs, along with Broken God dogma positioning him as a messianic figure and a component of MEKHANE. 

Another speculation among Hand members is that the Apostle Overwatch had imprisoned Qabil. Since relocation to the Seventeenth Forge, Qabil has not made a public appearance and security prevented outsiders from entering the Seventeenth Forge. Qabil&#39;s current status cannot be confirmed, though the Devout consistently stress that Qabil is working to rebuild MEKHANE and call for followers to send in any relic that could be a Piece of MEKHANE. 

//Intentions do not matter, what matters to all of us here is that the masquerade imposed by the Bookburners will be broken once MEKHANE is reassembled. Let the Devout rebuild MEKHANE, as they should.// ~ C.O.G.

//I beg to differ. The broken masquerade is meaningless if it only creates a prison in its place. The Devout appears to be hoarding all the world&#39;s mysteries to achieve their objectives, which contradicts the principles in which we stand for. Is the Broken God truly worth the price?// ~ L.S.

//Hey, no one really mentioned it here... But don&#39;t anyone think that the Devout&#39;s actions here are Jailor-ish? And speaking of the Jailors, where are they in all this?// ~ V.I VI 

//I come from a world where the Jailors don&#39;t exist. My roommate&#39;s alternate universe counterparts are consistently Jailors, but not in my universe&#39;s case.// ~ A.C. 

//V. I. VI, are you accusing the Devout of being Jailors? Perhaps you think of their actions to be akin to imprisonment, but they live among many foes such as the Bookburners. The Pieces are one-of-a-kind, and the destruction of any would cost the Devout&#39;s mission dearly. Securing and protecting the Pieces are of grave importance.// ~ C.O.G. 

//Conspiracy theorist much. Hate to spell it out for the smart ones browsing by, but there are similarities. And C.O.G., you are just a word beginning with the letter &#34;C&#34; away from the Jailor&#39;s famous motto. Let me see... secure the Pieces, contain them in the Forges, protect them from Bookburners. How about that?// ~ L.S. 

//Everyone, let us not start accusing one another to be closet Jailors, Bookburners or Madmen. Disunity will break us apart, as per the __Parable of the Three Arrows__. We have enough of this nonsense since [[[the-conspiracy-of-sigma-3|Sigma-3]]].// -- Jaya M.
