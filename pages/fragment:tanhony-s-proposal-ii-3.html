**Item #:** SCP-001-KEY

**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** Materials used for the creation of SCP-001-KEY instances are to be stored in a secure warehouse at Site-01. Any record of the concepts used to link an instance of SCP-001-KEY to SCP-001 is to be kept only on the secure Site-01 database, and amnestic therapy is to be used to prevent knowledge of said concepts from leaving Site-01.

Any non-viable SCP-001-KEY instances created as part of the project are to be stored in containment for further study that may benefit SCP-001 research efforts. Once the capabilities of SCP-001-KEY instances have been fully ascertained, containment of them in locations outside Site-01 is approved. In order to maintain potential containment of SCP-001, however, all instances of SCP-001-KEY must remain under observation at all times.

All creation of new SCP-001-KEY instances and research of existing SCP-001-KEY instances must be approved by Dr. Moto.

**Description:** SCP-001-KEY is the collective designation for a series of inanimate objects artificially linked to SCP-001 using conceptual engineering. Although the specific behaviour of each SCP-001-KEY instance differs, the consistent characteristics of a successful SCP-001-KEY instance are:

* An inability to act while under observation.
* A hostility towards conscious life.
* The capacity to end conscious life if given the opportunity.

All instances of SCP-001-KEY were created in the hopes that, by conceptually linking to SCP-001, observation of SCP-001-KEY would be equal to observation of SCP-001, thus resulting in a halt to obliterations.

------

**Addendum 001-KEY-1 (Instance Log):**

The following is a record of instances created as part of the SCP-001-KEY project. Note that only successful instances of SCP-001-KEY have been recorded — a full list of all instances produced is available from the Site-01 archives.

||~ Instance ||~ Further Information ||~ Comments ||
|| SCP-001-KEY-03 || Instance took the form of a humanoid statue which, when unobserved, appeared behind the nearest individual in a threatening posture. || //Subject judged only as a partial success — it&#39;s unclear whether its behaviour is due to actual hostility or simply playfulness. Relocated.// - Dr. Moto||
|| SCP-001-KEY-07 || Instance took the form of a humanoid statue which, when unobserved, attempts to snap the neck of the nearest individual.|| //Success! Subject demonstrates all three properties required for a viable SCP-001-KEY instance, and the minor scale of its attack makes it easily manageable. Although we must continue producing instances for the greatest risk of success, this is a very good sign.// - Dr. Moto ||
|| SCP-001-KEY-12 || Instance took the form of a spherical sculpture floating one meter in the air. Immediately after becoming unobserved for a period of 0.2 seconds, SCP-001-KEY-12 violently exploded, resulting in the deaths of attending personnel. || //Although the instance was a success in terms of demonstrating the required characteristics, it was an unequivocal failure in the fact that it immediately self-terminated. The deaths are a tragedy, too — but as long as we can achieve our goal, the lives we will save will be more than equal.// - Dr. Moto ||
|| SCP-001-KEY-13 || Instance took the form of a sculpture of a human head three meters in height and two meters in width. When unobserved, SCP-001-KEY-13 immediately breached containment by ramming through the nearest wall at extremely high speeds and proceeding to attempt an escape from Site-01. Instance was re-contained after breaching the outer wall of Site-01 and attempting to flee across the desert. || //Unclear whether this instance demonstrated the required characteristics: while the escape resulted in the deaths of nineteen personnel — god rest their souls — it&#39;s unclear whether this was intentional or simply collateral damage. All the same, I&#39;ve ordered this one terminated due to the difficulty of containment.// - Dr. Moto  ||
|| SCP-001-KEY-14 || Instance took the form of a complex of intersecting stalagmites and stalactites, with a series of coral-like growths erupting from the central mass. When unobserved for 0.2 seconds, no activity was immediately observed. However, later investigation revealed that — during those 0.2 seconds — one-hundred and forty-two civilians staying in the ███ ██████ Hotel in [REDACTED][[footnote]] The closest human settlement to Site-01. [[/footnote]] were killed via spontaneous and simultaneous human combustion. || //An unacceptable loss of life and breach of secrecy — I&#39;m told anomalous means had to be used to prevent the collapse of the Veil in this case. I&#39;ve ordered an immediate halt to production of SCP-001-KEY instances. If the principles behind the project hold, observation of all the extant instances we&#39;ve produced so far should be sufficient to prevent SCP-001 from acting. At any rate, there have been no obliterations recorded since the project began.// - Dr. Moto ||

**Addendum 001-KEY-02 (Incident 001-KEY-01):**

On 01/29/1993, the first observed double obliteration event caused by SCP-001 was recorded in Rome, Italy, with two tourists spontaneously being erased. It was later confirmed that, at the time of this event, all extant instances of SCP-001-KEY were being observed.

Several hours following news of this event, Dr. Moto left the following note in his office:

&gt; [[=]]
&gt; //We&#39;ve been looking at nothing.//
&gt; 
&gt; //I&#39;m sorry, Administrator. I&#39;ve failed you, sir.//
&gt; [[/=]]

Dr. Moto&#39;s body was later found in the temporary containment chamber of an SCP-001-KEY instance, having entered under the guise of performing vital research using his project head authorization. Cause of death confirmed as a broken neck. 

The project was discontinued, and all remaining SCP-001-KEY instances were moved to Site-19 1993.

**Addendum 001-KEY-03 (Reallocation of Resources):**

Following the cancellation of the SCP-001-KEY project, all remaining resources were reallocated to the construction and launch of an experimental extra-planetary observation module.
