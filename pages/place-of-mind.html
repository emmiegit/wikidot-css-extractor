[[div class=&#34;sky&#34;]]
[[=]]
[[span style=&#34;color:black&#34;]]It was dark, 
and the dark was peace, 
and the dark was rest, 
and the dark was safety.
There was light, but only from the stars and the moon, and what they offered was more illumination then light.
In the darkness were living shelves arranged in a circle like the stone monoliths of old.
These shelves had books on them of many lives and they too brought illumination.
Under the light of the moon and the stars was a beast, its coat was pitch black, like liquid shadow,
and it was warm, but a threat would only see the white of teeth.
The air was cool, but not cold, as a perfect summer night was,
and one could listen to the ambiance of life beyond the woodland perimeter longer than one could live.
It was dark,
and the dark was peace,
and the dark was rest,
and the dark was safety,
and in the dark one could see all the stars, because they were alone.[[/span]]
