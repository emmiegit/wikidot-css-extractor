    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>&#34;Mornin&#39; Overseers. It&#39;s nice to have all the big shots in one place. I hope ya don&#39;t mind if we smoke? Me and my brother are gaggin&#39; for a cig.&#34;
 
&#34;You can smoke.&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s awful kind of you, Overseer. Smart move. Keep your business partners happy. I s&#39;pose that smartness&#39; why you call the shots in this here Foundation. I thi -- hey, I don&#39;t recognise any of ya. I hoped I&#39;d see some familiar faces up on that board.&#34;
 
&#34;We think it&#39;s important to employ a dynamic hierarchical structure to promote a mobile work environment for all our employees. It helps with morale.&#34;

&#34;I  -- yeah -- yeah, that&#39;s what I figured. So, are ya willing to do business with us?&#34;

&#34;What&#39;s your demand?&#34;
 
&#34;Now, now, Overseers, I think you&#39;ve got a misunderstandin&#39; with us. This ain&#39;t a //demand//! This is us collectin&#39; our debt. You outta know better by now that we&#39;re just businessmen.&#34;

&#34;Businessmen that submerge islands when their debts aren&#39;t paid?&#34;

&#34;Oi, islands sink. Everythin&#39; breaks after a time, don&#39;t they Chris?&#34;

&#34;Yeah, everythin&#39; breaks sometime or another.&#34;

&#34;And if ya want to keep it that way, I think a little cash could go a long way.&#34;

&#34;&lt;sigh&gt; How much?&#34;

&#34;Well, seein&#39; it like you numbskulls keep tryin&#39; to paint us like crooks, I think 25 B&#39;s are in order.&#34;

&#34;Ya goin&#39; easy on &#39;em, Beryl.&#34;

&#34;What can I say? I&#39;m a lover, not a fighter.&#34;

&gt; Ladies and Gentlemen,
&gt; Attached to this note is a list of SCP-4450-α and -β&#39;s demands over time, and the results of our decisions.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; The demands from these assholes are getting ludicrous. Our position is untenable. We can&#39;t keep dispensing 95% of each Site&#39;s reserves every half year. We&#39;re going to bankrupt ourselves by agreeing with them.

&#34;And if we refuse your dema-- and if we say no?&#34;

&#34;Well, Overseer... where are you from?&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s classified.&#34;

&#34;Ah, c&#39;mon Overseer! We&#39;re all friends here. I&#39;ll ask again, what country ya from?&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m from France.&#34;

&#34;The France in Europe? What a lovely continent.&#34;

&#34;Would be a real shame if it were to break, eh Beryl?&#34;

&#34;That it would be, Chris. That it would be.&#34;

&#34;Are you seriously -- are you threating to destroy //Europe?//&#34;

&#34;No, no, no, no! There ya go misunderstandin&#39; us again, Overseer. It&#39;s not like that at all. It&#39;s just -- It&#39;s just that when my brother and I don&#39;t get our money, we get awful clumsy.&#34;

&#34;Very clumsy, yes. We can &#39;ardly control ourselves. And I&#39;m sure you know what it&#39;s like when we get clumsy. It would be a shame if we broke somethin&#39; important, wouldn&#39;t it?&#34;

&#34;You&#39;ll get your money. But first, we would like to ask a few questions.&#34;

&#34;You what? Overseer, oh overseer. It wouldn&#39;t be right. We&#39;re not here for some ol&#39; chit chat, are we Chris?&#34;
 
&#34;C&#39;mon Beryl, they&#39;ve been pretty good clients of ours, haven&#39;t they? We should give &#39;em somethin&#39;.&#34;

&#34;Oh, go on then. What&#39;s ya question, overseer?&#34;
 
&#34;Are you two.... human?&#34;

&lt;laughing&gt; 

&#34;Are we human, he says! What a laugh. We look like little green men, do we?&#34;

&#34;Just &#39;cause we make a deal with a friend of ours. No shame, you Foundation types, no shame.&#34;

&#34;What did your deal entail?&#34;

&#34;Ah, not too much. We act faster, zip around the place. And we&#39;re basically hard as nails. Right, Beryl?&#34;
