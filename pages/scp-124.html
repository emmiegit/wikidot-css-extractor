**Item #:** SCP-124

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-124 is to be kept in a 4.2 m x 2.1 m stone pit in its containment cell. The pit is to be 1.5 metres deep. A plastic tarp is to be placed over SCP-124 when not in use. Absolutely no biological matter is allowed within one metre of SCP-124 when not being studied. An armed guard is to be stationed outside SCP-124&#39;s cell at all times.

**Description:** SCP-124 is a plot of soil approximately 9 m^^2^^ in area and 14 m^^3^^ in size. It was recovered from a Detroit basement when authorities were notified of two teenagers growing large amounts of marijuana.

SCP-124 has the ability to grow any biological organism to its full potential in a relatively short amount of time (the length varies according to the complexity of the organism). Nothing growing in SCP-124 requires external nutrients or other resources (for example, a tomato plant would not require water or light). Pesticides, too, aren&#39;t needed, as SCP-124 has a repellent effect on any insect or other invertebrates not growing in it. Any food grown in SCP-124 is reported to be of very high quality, taste, and nutrition, no matter what state the food was in before being planted in SCP-124.
