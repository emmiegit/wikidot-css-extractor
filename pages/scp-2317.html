&gt; 
&gt; **Addendum 1: Procedure 220-Calabasas:** Procedure 220-Calabasas is a ritual to be performed at solar noon each day (defined as the moment when the sun reaches its height over SCP-2317). Performing Procedure 220-Calabasas requires the following:
&gt; [[span style=&#34;color:blue;&#34;]]
&gt; * Two armed Foundation security personnel with Security Clearance of Level 3 or higher (hereafter referred to as &#34;guards&#34;).
&gt; * One Foundation Personnel with Security Clearance of Level 4 (hereafter referred to as &#34;celebrant.&#34;)
&gt; * One Class-D Personnel, as specified under Special Containment Procedures (hereafter referred to as &#34;assistant.&#34;)
&gt; * [DATA EXPUNGED]
&gt; * One obsidian-edged knife (hereafter referred to as &#34;blade&#34;).
&gt; * One silver aspergillum and aspersorium, filled with at least 500 ccs of holy water blessed by a priest of Abrahamaic faith.
&gt; 
&gt; # Celebrant, guards, and assistant open SCP-2317, step through, and enter SCP-2317 Prime. Assistant will enter first, followed by guards, followed by celebrant. Guards will, at all times, maintain situational awareness of assistant, and should be prepared to prevent escape with deadly force.
&gt; # Beginning with the pillar closest to and in-line with SCP-2317 (SCP-2317-A), celebrant circumambulates SCP-2317-A through SCP-2317-G, proceeding counter-clockwise at an even and measured pace. At every other step, celebrant will scatter holy water, using the aspergillum and aspersorium, in the direction of the circle&#39;s center.
&gt; # Upon completing one circumambulation of SCP-2317-A-G, celebrant scatters holy water over the head of the assistant and recites the following phrase: &#34;//█████ █████, █████ █████, █████ ██████ ███ ███ ███████ ████.//&#34;
&gt; # [DATA EXPUNGED]
&gt; # Assistant then circumambulates SCP-2317-A-G in a clockwise direction, scattering the mixture of blood and holy water in the direction of the circle&#39;s center.
&gt; # Upon completing one circumambulation of SCP-2317-A-G, assistant walks to the center of the circle of stones and pours the remaining mixture of blood and water onto the discolored patch of salt and sand in the center, while reciting the following phrase: &#34;//█████ ███ ███ ███ ████, █████ ███ ███ ███ ████.//&#34;
&gt; # All materials are gathered up, the obsidian knife is secured, and all personnel return through SCP-2317, which is subsequently closed.
&gt; 
&gt; Failure at any point to properly perform Procedure 220-Calabasas may result in an XK-Class End of the World Scenario. Should any mishap or failure occur, all personnel are to return immediately through SCP-2317, closing the door behind them. The containment chamber will be immediately locked down, and a Level Two Emergency declared and reported to the O5 Council.

&gt; 
&gt; SCP-2317-H is a spherical space one hundred kilometers in diameter located directly underneath SCP-2317-A-G, lined with the same stone used to construct SCP-2317-A-G. Contained within SCP-2317-H is SCP-2317-K, hereafter referred to as &#34;entity.&#34; 
&gt; 
&gt; The following information has been inferred through seismic analysis and ground-penetrating radar, as well as direct observation: Entity appears to be an obese humanlike creature of immense proportions: estimated height if fully erect is over two hundred kilometers. Horns resembling tree branches sprout from its head, which lacks a lower jaw. Entire body is covered in millions of overlapping plate-like scales. Seven heavy hooks are embedded in the entity&#39;s back, each one attached to a heavy steel chain connected to the lower end of one of the seven pillars embedded in the ceiling of the chamber.
&gt; 
&gt; At the time of the writing of this document, six of the pillars or chains have been broken or damaged, and only one chain remains intact.[[/span]]

&gt; **Addendum 2317-1: Procedure 220-Calabasas:** Procedure 220-Calabasas is a ritual to be performed at solar noon each day (defined as the moment when the sun reaches its height over SCP-2317). Performing Procedure 220-Calabasas requires the following:
&gt; 
&gt; * Two armed Foundation security personnel with Security Clearance of Level 3 or higher (hereafter referred to as &#34;guards&#34;).
&gt; * One Foundation Personnel with Security Clearance of Level 4 (hereafter referred to as &#34;celebrant.&#34;
&gt; * One Class-D Personnel, as specified under Special Containment Procedures (hereafter referred to as &#34;assistant.&#34;)
&gt; * [[span style=&#34;color:blue;&#34;]]One live male //Gallus domesticus//, preferably caged to prevent complications during transport to SCP-2317-Prime (hereafter referred to as &#34;chicken.&#34;)[[/span]]
&gt; * One obsidian-edged knife (hereafter referred to as &#34;blade&#34;).
&gt; * One silver aspergillum and aspersorium, filled with at least 500 ccs of holy water blessed by a priest of Abrahamaic faith.
&gt; * One kiloton-level nuclear device, to be detonated in case of catastrophic containment failure.
&gt; 
&gt; # Celebrant, guards, and assistant open SCP-2317, step through, and enter SCP-2317 Prime. Assistant will enter first, followed by guards, followed by celebrant. Guards will, at all times, maintain situational awareness of assistant, and should be prepared to prevent escape with deadly force.
&gt; # Beginning with the pillar closest to and in-line with SCP-2317 (SCP-2317-A), celebrant circumambulates SCP-2317-A through SCP-2317-G, proceeding counter-clockwise at an even and measured pace. At every other step, celebrant will scatter holy water, using the aspergillum and aspersorium, in the direction of the circle&#39;s center.
&gt; # Upon completing one circumambulation of SCP-2317-A-G, celebrant scatters holy water over the head of the assistant and recites the following phrase: [[span style=&#34;color:blue;&#34;]]&#34;//Seven Seals, Seven Rings, Seven Thrones for the [[[SCP-231|Scarlet King]]].//&#34;
&gt; # Celebrant then moves to a safe distance away from assistant, who will take the obsidian knife and use it to kill the chicken provided as sacrifice. Blood will be drained from the chicken and added to the aspersorium, then stirred to mix with the holy water already contained within.[[/span]]
&gt; # Assistant then circumambulates SCP-2317-A-G in a clockwise direction, scattering the mixture of blood and holy water in the direction of the circle&#39;s center.
&gt; # Upon completing one circumambulation of SCP-2317-A-G, assistant walks to the center of the circle of stones and pours the remaining mixture of blood and water onto the discolored patch of salt and sand in the center, while reciting the following phrase: [[span style=&#34;color:blue;&#34;]]&#34;//Blood for the Old Gods, Water for the New King.//&#34;[[/span]]
&gt; # All materials are gathered up, the obsidian knife is secured, and all personnel return through SCP-2317, which is subsequently closed.
&gt; 
&gt; Failure at any point to properly perform Procedure 220-Calabasas may result in an XK-Class End of the World Scenario. Should any mishap or failure occur, all personnel are to return immediately through SCP-2317, closing the door behind them. The containment chamber will be immediately locked down, and a Level Two Emergency declared and reported to the O5 Council. Further instructions will be provided to on-site personnel according to Emergency Order Zachariah, and may include detonation of on-site nuclear warhead.
&gt; 
&gt; [[span style=&#34;color:blue;&#34;]]**Addendum 2317-2: History:** SCP-2317 was first discovered in 1922, by [DATA EXPUNGED]. Object was subsequently moved to what was then called Provisional Containment Area 17. Object was moved to Containment Area 179 in 1982, where it remains as of the writing of this article.
&gt; 
&gt; When initially discovered, four of the seven chains were broken, and three were intact: the breaking of the fifth chain in ████ corresponded directly to a ██████████ event in our world. The sixth chain, which broke in ████, was also coincident with a much more severe ██████████ event, eventually resulting in the deaths of two million persons.
&gt; 
&gt; Analysis of supplementary texts retrieved at the time of containment pointed to Procedure 220-Calabasas as an effective means of maintaining containment until an effective means of repairing or reattaching said chains can be discovered. Containment procedures were modified to incorporate Procedure 220-Calabasas. As records show that the sequence of ██████████ events shows an exponential increase in lethality, it can be extrapolated that failure of the final chain (SCP-2317-G), would result in an XK-Class End of the World Scenario. 
&gt; 
&gt; For this reason, every possible effort is to be made to ensure a successful Procedure 220-Calabasas.[[/span]]

&gt; USER NAME: [[[o5-command-dossier|O5-13]]]
&gt; TITLE: Operational Overseer
&gt; DISPLAYING SCP-2317, CLEARANCE LEVEL O5 

&gt; + SCP-2317
&gt; -----
&gt; **Item #:** SCP-2317
&gt; 
&gt; **Special Access Designation:** CODE NIGHTMARE REGENT RED
&gt; 
&gt; **Special Containment Procedures:** Irrelevant.
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** SCP-2317 is a primeval entity known as &#34;The ████████ ████, Devourer of Worlds&#34; (name redacted intentionally). The Erikesh Codex indicates that it was captured and imprisoned by Erikeshan mystics circa 1894 BCE. An excerpt from the relevant passage follows:
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; AND THEN KESHPETH LED HIS ARMY OF TEN THOUSAND INTO THE REALM BEYOND THE CLOUDS, AND THERE DID THEY DO BATTLE WITH THE DEVOURER, MAY HIS NAME REMAIN FOREVER UNREMEMBERED. AND THEN KESHPETH AND HIS TEN THOUSAND DID CRAFT SEVEN CUNNING CHAINS OUT OF THE BONES OF JASPETAR, SEVENTH BRIDE OF THE DREAD DEVOURER, MAY HIS NAME REMAIN FOREVER UNREMEMBERED, AND BOUND HIM WITHIN THE PEARL OF THE FATHER OF OYSTERS, HE WHO DWELLS UNDER THE MIRROR OF SALT IN THE REALM UNDER THE SEA. AND KESHPETH ORDERED THAT THE GATES TO THE FAR COUNTRY BE SEALED FOREVER, LEST THE DREAD DEVOURER, MAY HIS NAME REMAIN FOREVER UNREMEMBERED, FIND ITS WAY BACK TO OUR WORLD.
&gt; 
&gt; It is not clear how the 19th-century Society of the Golden Arrow discovered how to create a gate to Universe-Kappa-Erikesh, nor their reasons for doing so. What is clear is that the damage to the first four chains that bind the Devourer was accidental. By the time Our Founder took possession of the item following the dissolution of the Society, the organization had bankrupted itself several times over trying desperately to repair the damage caused.
&gt; 
&gt; **Projected Containment Profile:** Indications are that Final Containment Failure will occur at some point within the next century as of the writing of this article: the mean time to failure being calculated at thirty years. All efforts to repair or replace the chains have failed. All efforts to re-discover the method for creating these chains have proven fruitless. Research is currently underway to determine an alternate containment plan, but the possibility that anything can keep the Devourer from entering our universe is slim, especially as the original material used to create the chains (namely, the bones and sinew of another Devourer entity) are no longer in existence.
&gt; 
&gt; The primary threat is internal despair or panic. In order to maintain morale, a false containment procedure (Procedure 220-Calabasas) will be authored and implemented. This false containment procedure has been given a sense of veracity by the following means:
&gt; * Incorporating elements of common ritualistic magics.
&gt; * Incorporating elements of popular religious rites.
&gt; * Incorporating elements of other known occult organizations.
&gt; * Incorporating elements of other known Special Containment Procedures.
&gt; * Incorporating references to similar but unrelated occult entities.
&gt; * Increased information security regarding the elements of the procedure.
&gt; * Appealing to the common institutional meme of the effectiveness of thermonuclear weapons in destroying paranormal entities.
&gt; 
&gt; Although completely ineffectual, the purpose of Procedure 220-Calabasas is to provide the appearance of active containment in order to allay anxiety among staff until a more permanent solution can be found.
&gt; 
&gt; In the meantime, preparations will be made in order to ensure the survival of the human race following Containment Failure. As most of the recommended preparations overlap with or are identical to preparations already underway in case of numerous other XK-Class scenarios, minimal additional resources are required.
&gt; 
&gt; Approved by the unanimous vote of the Overseer Council on ██-██-████.
