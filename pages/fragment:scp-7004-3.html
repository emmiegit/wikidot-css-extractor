[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

[The video begins in darkness. Outside, the muffled sound of boots scraping against the ground are heard. They are heard echoing into the surrounding room, suggesting a moderately large interior space.]

[The sound of Agent Cassandra Mullins’ voice is heard.]

**Mullins:** “What… what? Why am I here? Where…”

[The sounds of shuffled footsteps are heard. Mullins’ voice echoes into the room, replicating twice.]

**Mullins:** “Hello?”

Mullins’ voice continues to echo throughout the room.]

**Mullins [lower]:** “Ma’- Lina? Lina, are you there?”

[The sound of shuffled footsteps are heard again.]

**Mullins [quietly]:** “Oh no.”

[Several seconds pass.]

[The sound of the bag being set aside on a nearby surface is heard. Within it, the camera records the sounds of the bag’s contents bumping against one another, with several metallic objects creating louder noises. Outside, Mullins is heard hurriedly moving her hands across the surface of her clothes.]

**Mullins [quietly]:** “Winter coat. Civilian t-shirt. Military pants. Flashlight… no primary firearm.”

[Another two seconds pass. The sound of a holster being taken, held, and let go is heard.]

**Mullins [quietly]:** “No sidearm, either. Damn.”

[Two more seconds pass. Mullins is heard crouching beside the bag and holding it up against the nearby surface. The sound of a zipper being unzipped is heard. A dim blue light begins to illuminate the inside of the bag. Mullins begins to reach into the bag, taking objects from it and taking it out. As she does, more light begins to illuminate the interior.]

**Mullins [quietly]:** “Canned tomato soup. Peas. Beans.”

[Mullins continues to reach into the bag and taking things out.]

**Mullins [quietly]:** “Torn space blanket. Water. Water. More water…”

[Mullins has almost reached the bottom of the bag.]

**Mullins [quietly]:** “My wallet. I’m at least still keeping that with me.”

[Her hand reaches into the bag again before taking the camera itself. As it exits the bag, a long and dark hallway is shown, only being lit by blue emergency lights. The hallway stretches past the camera’s field of vision, and has no exits leading out.]

**Mullins [quietly]:** “Goddamn. It’s my helmet cam.”

[Mullins turns the camera to look at the wall, doing so in order to inspect the back.]

**Mullins [quietly]:** “With the autotranscriber taped on.”

[Mullins turns the camera on its side, causing the video to look up at the concrete ceiling. Large, unpowered fluorescent lamps are seen attached.]

**Mullins [quietly]:** “And broadcasting too. Did I…?”

[Finally, Navarra turns the camera towards her.]

**Mullins [quietly]:** “Ma’am, are you looking at this? Can you see me?”

[Mullins’ overall appearance is tired and dirty, with a dark brown grease being smeared on the right side of her face. Speckles of blood are seen dirtying her collar, with the fur lining of her winter coat being grey and black in places instead of white. Her hair is tied behind her head in a ponytail, with the strands on her forehead being matted with sweat. ]

[She stares into the camera for several seconds, before shaking her head.]

**Mullins [quietly]:** “Well, if anyone’s listening… I hope you’re watching out for me.”

[Sighing, Mullins clips the camera to the collar of her shirt. She raises the flashlight.]

**Mullins:** “Now… where am I?”

[She probes the beam of the flashlight into the darkness of the hall in front of her.]

**Mullins:** “And how did I get here?”

[Crouching down, Mullins quickly places all the objects she took out from her bag back into it. As the camera pans over the bag, it can be clearly seen that it is the brown MOLLE from earlier logs, although dirtied, torn, and tattered in places. She slings the bag over her shoulder.]

**Mullins:** “Alright. Let’s get to business.”

[Over the next few minutes, Mullins begins to walk deeper into the long hallway, with the only sounds in the interior being her slow, echoing footsteps.]

[After three minutes, a door can be seen to the left. Mullins turns to it, beams the flashlight to the surroundings of the door. The words “MAINTENANCE TUNNEL” are written on a sign located above it.]

**Mullins:** “Huh.”

[Turning away, Mullins beams the flashlight down the long, dark hallway, which continues on past what can be seen. Mullins turns to the door again. She takes a few seconds to look between both paths, considering which to take.]

[After a few seconds, she sighs.]

**Mullins:** “Road less taken, I guess.”

[Slowly, she reaches out to the door’s knob, turning it quietly as she slowly opens it. As soon as the door is ajar, she quickly yet quietly moves into the room, checking the corner behind it. It is empty. Turning around, she checks the rest of the immediate area. The only things she sees are pipes of an indeterminate purpose attached to the walls, and a metal staircase leading down. A dim blue light is seen emanating from the corner past the staircase.]

[Slowly, Mullins begins to advance, keeping the flashlight in front of her as she walks. Slowly, she moves down the staircase, turning a corner in the direction of the blue light.]

[Like the blue light seen earlier, this lamp again emanates from an emergency lamp placed high on the wall. Below it, the words “AWL THAT AR SAIN AR TU FOLOU THIS PATH TO MAIN EVAK.” are untidily scrawled on the wall with white chalk in a matter similar to the writings of a small child. Below it, an arrow pointing further down the hall is seen scrawled with the same chalk.]

**Mullins:** “Sane? Main evac?”

[Mullins points the flashlight further down the narrow corridor. Nothing else can be seen but the darkness ahead.]

**Mullins:** “Ah… crap.”


[Slowly, Mullins begins to walk forward again, keeping the flashlight in front. Her footsteps continue to echo through the hallway.]

[After several minutes, a second pair of feet are heard echoing throughout the chamber, keeping pace with Mullins.]

[However, she does not notice this, instead walking forward for the next several minutes. The footsteps keep in almost perfect pace with Mullins’, though one seems to drag, like that of a slight limp.]

[Ahead, another blue emergency light can be seen, underneath of which can be seen another note, written again in chalk.]

[Interested, Mullins begins to increase her pace. The footsteps behind her attempt to compensate, quietly scraping across the ground in its attempt to do so.]

[Mullins kneels down to look at the writing on the wall. The words “TO CONTROL ROOM: RAYT. TO EVAC: LEFT. KEEP ENI INSAIN OWT. MENI HAV ALREDY DAED.”]

**Mullins:** “Keep any insane out? Many have already died…?”

[She stands up. Slowly, she moves backward.]

**Mullins:** “What does any of this…”

[Surprised, the footsteps behind her begin to backtrack, but are unable to keep in pace with Mullins. A loud stumble is heard behind her.]

**Mullins:** “What the-”

[Turning around, Mullins brings the flashlight to bear behind her, shining light on an SCP-7004-1 instance. Laying on the ground, it brings one of its hands up in a gesture that causes Mullins to stop.]

**SCP-7004-1 PETAL Instance:** “No… Please! [incomprehensible] …don’t hurt us!”

[Unlike the other instances, which are unclothed, the instance has a large, thick but dirty fur blanket wrapped around the region above its legs. This obscures any possible PETAL entites making up the instance, aside from the one speaking. This particular instance resembles a thirteen year old girl, with matted blonde hair and a face smeared with ash. Its expression shows pure fear.]

**Mullins:** “What are you-”

**SCP-7004-1 PETAL Instance:** “No… Please! Don’t… [incomprehensible] …don’t hurt us!”

[Mullins is unable to speak. She stares at the SCP-7004-1 instance, shaking her head slightly in disbelief and shock.]

**Mullins:** “No. No, no, no //no.//”

**SCP-7004-1 PETAL Instance:** “We came… only for… [incomprehensible]... safety. Just safety. For us.”

[The PETAL instance speaks in an indeterminate and alien accent, but the fear in its voice is apparent. It shakes as it speaks.]

**Mullins:** “Why… why…”

**SCP-7004-1 PETAL Instance:** “We only followed what was [incomprehensible] ...what they said on the radio.”

[Mullins begins to raise her voice.]

**Mullins:** “Who? //Who?//”

**SCP-7004-1 PETAL Instance:** “[incomprehensible] The man! The man on the radio, the Foundation man! What he said… [incomprehensible]”

**Mullins [shocked]:** “The Foundation… I… I don’t understand…”

**SCP-7004-1 PETAL Instance:** “It was everything they said! [incomprehensible] It’s so dangerous out there… [incomprehensible] ...so horrible… we cannot go back. The insane [incomprehensible] …they will kill us.”

**Mullins [shell-shocked]:** “My head… it doesn’t hurt anymore. I can hear everything you have to say. //Everything.//”

[With difficulty, the SCP-7004-1 instance begins to move forward, crawling on its knees despite the weight placed upon them. It begins to cling to Mullins’ ankle, while still keeping the blanket around its neck with its other hand. Tears run down its face as it tries to plead.]

**SCP-7004-1 PETAL Instance:** “It was everything they said! [incomprehensible] Please don’t take us back… [incomprehensible] ...Please… Do not hurt us… I… [incomprehensible] I have my brother-sister here with me. They are only children, please…”

**Mullins [shell-shocked]:** “Wait… //children//?”

[Without stopping to think, Mullins throws the blanket off the SCP-7004-1 instance, exposing two more PETAL instances, each clinging desperately to the first PETAL instance. Both resemble children less than six years of age, and are shivering as they look up at Mullins. Among the three instances, they all share the same blonde hair and dark eyes.]

**SCP-7004-1 PETAL Instance:** “No!”

[Immediately, the first PETAL instance scrambles to take the blanket, moving forward on bloodied knees as it attempts to wrap the blanket around itself. As it does so, it stands up, the fear in its eyes becoming even stronger as it looks at Mullins.]

**SCP-7004-1 PETAL Instance:** “Do not hurt them! They are just my… We are… [incomprehensible] ...we are just…”

**Mullins [shell-shocked]:** “People. You’re just people. People… made into this.”

[Filled with a new-found understanding, the PETAL instance nods eagerly.]

**SCP-7004-1 PETAL Instance:** “Yes… yes… [incomprehensible] ...we are just-”

**Navarra:** “Get the fuck away from her!”

**Mullins [quietly]:** “Wait… no…”

[In response to Navarra, the SCP-7004-1 instance begins to turn to address the sound. Mullins reaches out her hand.]

**Mullins:** “Wait, NO!”

[Suddenly, several silenced gunshots are heard, each ripping through the SCP-7004-1 instance instantly. Blood splatters on Mullins, and, as the PETAL instance looks down at her with a new, rushing fear, it collapses to the ground.]

**Mullins [quietly]:** “No… no… Oh God…”

**Navarra:** “CASS!”

[Immediately, Navarra can be seen rushing out of the darkness, holding her assault rifle in one hand. Blood covers much of her clothes, and as she comes into view of the blue light, her face is covered in blood as well. As she gets in front of Mullins, she kneels, embracing her.]

**Navarra:** “Oh God… I almost thought I lost you… I almost did.”

**Mullins [quietly]:** “You… you…”

[Navarra separates from Mullins, placing both of her bloody hands on Mullins’ cheeks.]

**Navarra:** “Did it hurt you? Are you hurt?”

[Navarra eyes shift to the side of Mullins’ face, before looking at the other one.]

**Navarra:** “Fuck, you lost your earplugs? You know we can’t twist anymore, we have nothing but-”

**Mullins [muttering]:** “Stop…”

[Navarra’s eyes widen. A hurt expression comes through on her face.]

**Navarra:** “What?

**Mullins:** “//Stop.//”

[Navarra removes her hands from Mullins’ cheeks, but still keeps her eyes on her.]

**Navarra:** “I’m… I’m sorry.”

**Mullins [incredulous]:** “//Sorry?//”

[Mullins begins to pant heavily. Her voice begins to be filled with emotion.]

**Mullins:** “I believed you. You told me they were skips. That they weren’t people. That they didn’t matter.”

[Navarra cocks her head to the side, then shakes it.]

**Navarra:** “No, stop, you can’t think about this any-”

**Mullins [loudly]:** “//Why not?!//”

[Navarra stares at Mullins, her eyes wide.]

**Mullins:** “That… man and his daughter… the person that tried to get in front of my car… all the ones back in Watson Lake… they were people. The man was… using the radio to get here. The person that got in front of my car tried to stop me.”

**Mullins [quietly]:** “//And I killed them all.//”

**Mullins:** “All those people in the mountains, the ones building the towers in Calgary… they were waving their arms. They were trying to touch the car, get our attention. //Ask for help.//”

**Mullins [quietly]:** “//And we ran them over.//”

[Mullins raises her hand, pointing a quaking finger at the corpse in front of her.]

**Mullins:** “That girl… she was trying to escape. With her family, her siblings. She finally got here and…”

[Mullins, shaking with anger, moves in close to Navarra’s face.]

**Mullins [quietly]:** “//And you shot them dead.//”

[Over the course of the next few seconds, as Mullins speaks, Navarra’s expression turns from puzzlement to horror. She shakes her head.]

**Navarra:** “No, no, no no no no.”

[She places both of her hands on Mullins’ shoulders, looking into her eyes.]

**Navarra:** “You can’t be falling for this. You can’t be, not now. //Not now.//”

[A tear runs down Navarra’s cheek. Her upper lip quivers.]

**Navarra:** “I went through hell and high water to get us here. I dragged you out of that wreck in the mountains when you couldn’t stop screaming from the pain. I nursed you back to health. I fought tooth and nail to //keep you alive//, for a thousand //fucking// miles.”

[Navarra shakes Mullins violently by her shoulders. She gnashes her teeth as she does so, while tears begin to run down her cheeks.]

**Navarra [shouting]:** “You will fucking //fight//, you hear me?! You will keep going and forget. You will be right by me when we fucking //end this.// Because-”

[Navarra exhales, and her shoulders deflate. At once, she goes from being at the height of rage to looking completely defeated.]

**Navarra:** “Because you’re the only one I have left.”

[She looks up at Mullins, her tears casting clear paths on the dried blood on her face.]

**Navarra:** “Which is why I need you to fight. //Please.//”

[Navarra’s lips continue to quiver.]

**Navarra:** “//Please.//”

[A long silence passes between the two as they stare at each other.]

**Mullins:** “Please promise me something… Lina.”

[Navarra looks at her, moving her face close to Mullins’.]

**Mullins:** “When you get out there… and end this thing,”

[Mullins stands up, with Navarra following suit, nodding along as Mullins speaks. Her expression is hopeful as she listens.]

[Mullins holds Navarra’s hands, and squeezes them.]

**Mullins:** “Do it… for them.”

[She looks back at the SCP-7004-1 corpse behind her. As she turns to Navarra, the latter’s eyes begin to widen.]

**Navarra [quietly]:** “No. Stop.”

**Mullins:** “Because… honestly?”

[Mullins’ eyes begin to tear up, as if realizing the gravity of what she’s about to say. Slowly, she removes the camera from her shirt collar, pinning it to Navarra’s. Navarra looks up at her, horror crossing her expression.]

**Navarra:** “Cass, no.”

[Mullins smiles. Despite this, tears can be seen welling up in her eyes.]

[Navarra places her hands on Mullins’ cheeks. She is shaking her head, muttering as if in denial.]

**Navarra [desperate]:** “Stop thinking about it, stop!”

[Mullins breathes in, deeply.]

**Mullins [slowly]:** “Lina, they’re just…”

[Suddenly, Mullins begins to heave, as if wanting to vomit. Her eyes continue to stay on Navarra.]

**Mulllins:** “I- “

[Mullins more violently dry heaves again, moving her right hand up to her mouth as she begins to moving back.]

**Mullins:** “I’m sorry.”

[Immediately after, Mullins vomits a large amount of blood, staggering back further as she does so. As she moves her hands down to her abdomen, she begins to scream in agony.]

[A long ripping sound is heard from Mullins’ abdomen, followed by a slow trickle of blood from between her fingers. She continues to scream as this happens.]

[Then, as Mullins looks down at her body, the discernible shape of a bloody arm begins to pry itself from between her hands. This arm then begins to cling to the sides of Mullins’ abdomen, using it to pull itself out, revealing another arm.]

[As Mullins screams, a voice is heard from the large gaping wound in her abdomen. The words “HELP US” can be heard prominently.]

[Slowly, as the wound widens, a human head resembling that of a female emerges. Its long hair is matted with blood, nearly covering her eyes as she looks straight at the camera. As she continues to emerge, the PETAL instance screams in anguish, using her arms to push herself up against the surroundings of the wound. This causes Mullins to fall to the ground with the added weight and force, causing her to scream loudly again as she continues to bleed profusely on the ground. Soon after, her head and body goes limp.]

[By this point, the newly emerged PETAL instance’s waist can already be seen emerging from the wound. As it screams once again, it gives one last push against Mullins’ body, stopping once the top of its hips can be seen. As blood continues to drip from its face and hair onto the floor, it begins to speak.]

**SCP-7004-1 PETAL Instance:** “Oh… [incomprehensible]... happened? I…”

[In horror, the PETAL instance brings its hands up close to its face, trembling with horror as it looks at them. A strangled whimper is heard coming from it.]

**Navarra [horrified]:** “What… what //are you?//”

[Then, slowly, the PETAL instance turns from its hands to look at Navarra and the camera. Its bloodshot eyes can be seen in detail as it widens with shock.]

**SCP-7004-1 PETAL Instance [in shock]:** “I… I…”

[As it looks at Navarra, it slowly brings its head up, as if trying to gain a better view of Navarra. It continues to tremble as it speaks.]

**SCP-7004-1 PETAL Instance [in pain]:** “//Help.//”

[The PETAL instance’s voice is identical to that of Cassandra Mullins.]

[A second later, it suddenly screams at the top of its lungs in agony once again as another pair of arms appear at its waist, using it as a handhold to pull itself up. As the first PETAL instance continues to scream, Navarra, shell-shocked, staggers to her feet and begins to run away.]

[Behind her, the newly created SCP-7004-1 instance continues to scream in excruciating pain, with additional tearing sounds being heard as Navarra gets further and further away from the scene. As she runs, she sees another blue light ahead of her, illuminating a split in the hallway which goes both right and left.]

[As she comes upon the intersection, Navarra takes the time to catch her breath, bending down and putting her hands on her knees as she does so. Her breath is shaking as she does so, indicating quiet sobbing. After a few seconds, she gets to her feet and punches the wall next to her, screaming as she releases her pent-up aggression.]

**Navarra [screaming]:** “FUCK!”

[She punches the wall again.]

**Navarra [screaming]:** “FUCK!”

[She punches the wall a third time, before following it up with several more.]

**Navarra [screaming]:** “Fuck, fuck fuck fuck, //FUCK!//”

[Continuing to sob, Navarra slumps against the wall, leaning her head against her arm.]

**Navarra [quietly sobbing]:** “I’m sorry… I’m sorry… I’m fucking sorry, Cass.”

[She wipes away her tears and sweat with her arm, looking back at the dark hallway behind her.]

**Navarra [quietly sobbing]:** “Fuck. //Fuck.//”

[Exhaling one last time, Navarra stands up, trying to regain her composure. She continues to shake as she does so, barely suppressing her sobs. After a few seconds, she straightens her posture, looking at the intersection before her. A sign with the words “CONTROL ROOM” is placed on the right side. Another sign with the words “STORAGE” is seen on the left.]

**Navarra [angry]:** “Let’s…”

[She takes the time to breathe in again.]

**Navarra [determined]:** “Let’s fucking finish this.”

[Balling her fists, Navarra walks forward with composure, immediately turning right. As she does, a light emanating from an unseen source can be found in front of her. As she gets closer, it becomes clear that the hallway terminates into a large metal door, which seems to have been removed from its hinges and placed again within the doorway. The light, as seen earlier, is coming from the space between the floor and the door.]

[Walking forward with determination, Navarra crosses the hallway and in front of the metal door before looking up. The words “CONTROL ROOM” are seen on a sign above the door.]

[The muffled sound of several voices are heard beyond the door. The words “Open, OPEN! Open, goddamnit!” are clearly heard from within the room.]

[Navarra readies her assault rifle in both hands.]

**Navarra [quietly]:** “Last stop.”

[Then, with a scream of effort, she kicks the door in, bringing her rifle to bear in front of her as she moves inside the room. As she does, she freezes as she sees something in front of her.]

[In front of Navarra is a large entity composed of dozens of seemingly dead corpses and assorted limbs and heads, all centered on a hunched figure standing still in the middle of the room. Upon closer inspection, the figure, which resembles an old man, merges with all of the other body parts and corpses around him, with its left arm and the entire back of its head being one with the surrounding mass, while the right arm rests beside a large lever protected by glass. It seems to only be standing through the effort of the arms and legs on the bottom of the mass, with the legs of the figure itself seeming to hover a few centimeters from the ground. Great deals of light seep in from the surrounding windows which encompass the entire circumference of the room, offering a look into the floor below. The figure watches Navarra with a surprised look as she enters. Soon after, the entire mass begins to speak.]

**Entity:** “A native. What are you…”

[Each of the heads that make up the entity continue to speak as the central figure does, though with an increasing but slight delay for the heads that are distributed further from the figure. They all speak with the same dead emotion and careful enunciation. So far, only the central figure seems to be able to make nonverbal gestures with its hands. Its eyebrows are knotted together in anger as it speaks. Its voice is the same as the voice on the radio at Watson Lake.]

**Entity:** “//What are you doing here?//”

[Navarra begins to shake with anger.]

**Navarra:** “To end this.”

[The figure knots its eyebrows together.]

**Entity:** “//End this?//”

**Entity:** “You have no idea how much I’ve done to get here.”

[Navarra tightens her grip on the rifle, moving forward as if in an attempt to intimidate.]

**Navarra:** “And so have fucking I!”

[The figure’s eyes widen, before lowering into a deep scowl.]

**Entity:** “You’re Foundation, aren’t you? Just like me?”

[Navarra doesn’t reply, instead staring back at the entity.]

**Entity:** “What are you doing this for? Glory? Hubris?”

[Its tone lowers.]

**Entity:** “//Someone you love?//”

[Navarra begins to tremble more violently with barely contained anger. She continues to tighten her grip on the firearm.]

**Entity:** “You came here for 2000, didn’t you?”

[It moves to face her, obviously wincing in pain as it does so. It moves to cover the lever.]

**Entity:** “To wipe us out? To make it so we never lived in the first place?”

[The figure attempts to shake its head, but cries out in pain as it does so. It continues to stare down Navarra.]

**Entity:** “We came here to flee. We came here for another… second chance. You won’t stand in the way of that, no matter how long it takes for me to get this fucking thing open.”

[Navarra lets out an exasperated breath, trying hard to restrain herself.]

**Navarra:** “//Get the hell out of my way.//”

[The entity moves forward suddenly, causing Navarra to step back.]

**Entity:** “You came here for nothing. It won’t let me in.”

[The figure coughs suddenly, before looking back up at Navarra.]

**Entity:** “And I doubt you have the clearance to do it, either.”

[Navarra doesn’t reply, instead staring back at the figure.]

**Entity:** “Go back.”

[It takes another pained step forward. Then, along with the figure, the entity raises the hands of all the bodies within it to point at the hallway behind her.]

**Entity:** “//Go.// //Back.//”

[Navarra stays still.]

[After a few seconds, realization dawns on the entity’s face.]

**Entity:** “You… you have it, don’t you?”

[Navarra doesn’t reply.]

[A tense silence intervenes.]

[Then, with all the bodies within it screaming at once, the entity runs at Navarra, swiping at her with all the arms on its body.]

[Quickly, Navarra runs to the side, causing its strike to hit the wall. As she does so, she presses the assault rifle to her shoulder, before firing several rounds at the entity. Most make impact, causing the entity to lean into the wall for support. Several of the bodies that were struck cease to move as it does so.]

[The entity lets out a hacking cough followed by the sound of spitting as it presses its hands on the wall for support.]

**Entity:** “No, no no //no.//”

[Slower than earlier, it turns to Navarra, looking at her with menace and desperation. A large trail of blood is seen below its mouth.]

**Entity:** “So many depend on me. So many. So many.”

[It lumbers forward again, taking one step as it continues to glare at Navarra. Its breathing is labored.]

**Entity:** “I won’t… //let you.//”

[With another loud scream, the entity moves to take a swipe at Navarra, but not before she fires again, creating multiple wounds on the figure’s chest and on the bodies close to it.]

[It takes a step back. The figure coughs again.]

**Entity:** “Oh…”

[It looks down upon itself. Blood is continuously trickling from its wounds.]

**Entity:** “Oh God.”

[Then, slowly, it falls to the ground, leaning against the wall. The figure coughs again.]

[Navarra lowers her assault rifle before moving to face the entity. The figure looks up at her. Its eyes are wide.]

**Entity:** “Please don’t do this. Please don’t wipe us out. We…”

[It coughs once more, hacking up blood.]

**Entity:** “//We deserve a second chance.//”

[Navarra stares down at it.]

**Navarra:** “You killed billions. Destroyed the world. //They// deserved a second chance.”

[The figure desperately shakes its head.]

**Entity:** “No, no no no. You don’t understand. You don’t understand.”

**Navarra:** “I believe I do.”

[She turns around and moves to the large control panel on the other side of the room, which houses a large lever at the center that is surrounded by a protective glass covering. Beside it is a fingerprint scanner and a keypad, upon which the numbers 9-15-1066 have been inputted.]

[Quietly, she presses her thumb to the scanner.]

[Instantly, the glass covering opens, exposing the lever.]

**Entity:** “Please. Please don’t do this. //Please.//”

[Navarra is silent. The light from the nearby window in front of her lights up her surroundings.]

[Trembling, she slowly places her hand on the lever. She raises her other hand to input new numbers into the keypad.]

**Entity:** “Look outside, I beg you.”

[The figure’s voice is more composed than it was before, though it continues to tremble.]

[Navarra stops.]

**Navarra:** “What?”

**Entity:** “Look outside, please.”

[Navarra turns to face it. The figure looks back at her with desperation on its face.]

**Entity:** “You’ll… you’ll understand.”

[Navarra looks at it wordlessly.]

**Entity:** “//You’ve won.// Just… please do me this one last thing.”

[Navarra stares back at it.]

[And then she quietly moves away from the lever to look outside.]

[As she does, she sees a large scene below: Within hundreds of storage units on the floor before her, many have been repurposed into living spaces for at least two hundred SCP-7004-1 instances. Unlike before, these instances behave with a much more human countenance, speaking to each other and attempting to walk with the support of both their arms and single pairs of legs. Blankets are seen on many of the instances, with even more being handed out freely by several instances wearing blue Foundation guard attire. All of them are watching the control room from below. Some of the juvenile PETAL instances are seen crying, with older PETAL instances attempting to comfort them. Other PETAL instances are seen murmuring among themselves as they continue to look up at the control room.]

**Entity:** “They’re the sane ones. The only… sane ones out of the billions who came here. The rest are the ones you’ve seen- Insane. Wailing. Feral.”

[It coughs again, spitting up more blood. Its voice gets weaker.]

**Entity:** “I’m the one at fault. I’m the one who gambled to get us here. Kill //me//, finish //me// off…”

[It points to the direction of the outside.]

**Entity:** “But please… please not them. Give them a second chance.”

[Its voice gets lower.]

**Entity:** “I… I beg of you. Plea-”

**Unknown:** “//Help.//”

[Both Navarra and the figure turn their heads to the voice. It is heard as an echo into the room, denoting the source of the voice as far away. It is identical to the voice of Cassandra Mullins. Soon after, it is followed by several more screams, which come from different voices.]

[A quiet choke is heard from Navarra as she hears the voice.]

**Mullins:** “[incomprehensible] need help! [Incomprehensible] there anyone… anyone here?”

[The figure watches Navarra. Pity is seen on its face.]

**Entity:** “You… know her? Lost… her?”

[It coughs.]

**Navarra:** “Y… yes.”

[Navarra’s voice is quiet as she speaks.]

**Entity:** “Then… then you understand.”

[Quietly, Navarra chuckles. It is mixed with suppressed sobbing.]

[Seconds pass. The voices are heard getting further and further away, before becoming too far to hear.]

[Navarra is heard quietly sniffling. She is trembling.]

**Navarra:** “I remember the time… when Cass and I were driving here. She just fucked up, almost got us killed, drove for ten hours just to make it up to me.”

[Navarra looks at the entity, meeting the figure’s eyes.]

**Navarra:** “When I woke up, I told her… ‘You were unlucky, you fucked up… and that was it. You don’t need to atone.’”

[Her voice shakes.]

**Navarra [about to cry]:** “You…you just gotta make the best of what you got.”

[She looks down, tears falling from her eyes as she does so.]

**Navarra:** “I know what she meant now. Doing it for them. For you.”

**Navarra:** “I started on this journey wanting to reset the world, make it what it was. To make it so that you never came here in the first place.”

[She shakes her head.]

**Navarra:** “What… what was the date you put in the keypad?”

[The figure’s voice is almost nonexistent as it speaks.]

**Entity:** “The time our universes split in two- when our histories changed. I wanted to do it for… for a new beginning. So that my world can… continue.”

**Entity [whispering]:** “Even if our history wasn’t yours.”

[Navarra silently nods. She sniffles again.]

**Navarra:** “Our histories don’t have to be separate, then.”

[She turns around to face the lever again, placing her hand upon it. She looks back at the entity.]

**Navarra:** “//You//… you were just unlucky. Just like Cass said.”

[Navarra grunts in pain, pressing her hand to her belly. She smiles again through the pain.]

**Navarra:** “I don’t think I can forgive you for what you’ve done.”

[Navarra coughs, blood spurting from her mouth. She looks back up at the figure.]

**Navarra:** “But if we can have a new beginning… then let’s do it together.”

[The figure tries to smile, but is unable to. A single tear runs down its cheek.]

**Entity:** “Thank… you.”

[And then Navarra pulls the lever.]
