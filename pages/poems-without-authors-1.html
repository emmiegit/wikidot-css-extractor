Legend has it that in the early days of the Library -- insofar as chronology has any meaning within its halls -- there was a person. Or perhaps a creature, or a spectre, or a phenomenon, or a force. Or, quite feasibly, a group thereof. This entity, for reasons unknown, took it upon itself to compose short passages of verse, which it littered around the Library wherever it went. It was rarely observed directly, and then only briefly, but witness testimony all describe a striped jumper, greying beard, and kind eyes behind half-moon spectacles. The accuracy of these accounts is unknown since all other details varied wildly, but the entity or entities were nevertheless given the collective title of Poet(s)-in-Residence, and accumulated a great following through their work.

The activities of the Poet(s)-in-Residence in the present day, if any, are unknown. The last account was over two decades ago, and is now believed to have simply been one patron witnessing another while under the influence of powerful hallucinogens. It is likely that they have left the Library, or else retreated from the prying eyes of its growing populace. However, in the centuries since the Poet(s) first emerged, wanderers of the Library have taken it upon themselves to continue the tradition; it is now common to find scraps of anonymous poetry tucked between the pages of lesser-read books, or carved on the undersides of desks. Some of the oldest and most enduring works have become informal shrines, of sorts -- a collective testament to the Library&#39;s adoration for literature in all its forms.

Here, Library staff have collated a small volume of these so-called Poems Without Authors, covering the ever-broad topic of death, dying, and the loss or retention of the mind and self. Patrons are able and encouraged to add their own. Think of it as a way of giving back to the original Poet(s) -- assuming, of course, that they ever existed at all.

[[collapsible show=&#34;► So what actually is this?&#34; hide=&#34;◄ Hide&#34;]]

This is the first volume of Poems Without Authors, a collaborative poetry anthology with an emphasis on the critique and tweaking of others&#39; works, and the general appreciation of the wonders of verse. Each poem comes with a hidden area for users to leave critique, and I encourage anyone and everyone to suggest any tweaks or changes that spring to mind. It&#39;s an entirely unofficial project being run by [[*user MaliceAforethought]] (against the better judgement of himself and others) to try and encourage amateur poetry and improve his own poetic skills (which are rather mediocre at present). He reserves the right to trim/curate this anthology, but will hopefully only ever need to make little edits here and there.

If this one&#39;s well-received, expect additional pages for additional batches of poems for additional topics. The next are likely to be //Terra Incognita// (for stories of exploration and the unknown) and //Semper Fidelis// (for love, passion, and romance) -- preemptive submissions for both, as well as suggestions for this project in general, are both welcome. You can contact Malice through Wikidot PMs or as MAFT#2868 on the discord.

[[collapsible show=&#34;► Rules for contributing and critiquing&#34; hide=&#34;◄ Hide&#34;]]

This may be a little overcomplicated in places, so bear with me.

++++ To add a poem

Fairly simple, actually. The code is as follows:

[[code]]

++++ Where the poem was found

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ A topic, theme, or summary&#34; hide=&#34;- Hide this&#34;]]
placeholders
are rather scary
brutal, short
and temporary
[[/collapsible]]

[[size 0%]]
No commentary as of yet.
[[/size]]
----

[[/code]]

In-universe, the poems are untitled and anonymous, so try to keep with that theme. New poetry goes at the bottom of the page, and if you have anything you want to say pre-emptively about the poem -- a note on intentional structure or word choice, perhaps -- you can put that in the {{@@[[size 0%]]@@}} commentary box instead of {{No commentary as of yet}}. More on the exact purpose of that little section below. When you add a poem, post in the discussion page about it and make a note in the edit history -- something like &#34;Added a new poem!&#34; or &#34;Look upon my works, ye mighty, and despair&#34;. Bear in mind that other people might edit it, so check back occasionally to see what (if anything) people say. If they don&#39;t, I expect this project might stall out immediately, in which case this page&#39;ll languish eternally in the bottom of the archives, a shameful testament to my hubris. Such is the fate of man, and the destiny of mankind -- to flare up brightly, turn eyes and hearts and minds, and then to fade, and fall, with barely a grave-marker to note our feeble presence on this wretched earth. We are nothing but tracks in the sand, all of us, and by //God// the tide is coming in.

...I realise I&#39;ve gotten slightly off track. Ah well. Go forth and write!

++++ To edit, tweak, or critique a poem

There&#39;s a funky little box underneath each poem, where the size is 0%. It&#39;s hidden outside the page source, which is nice, and it&#39;s a place to ask questions about a poem, comment on it, or record any changes or edits you make. By way of example, let&#39;s say someone wrote the following poem:

&gt; placeholders
&gt; are super scary
&gt; brutal, short
&gt; and temporary

But oh no! You think the word &#34;super&#34; feels out-of-place, almost like a hastily-chosen synonym for the word they originally put there. In this case, you are more than welcome to switch out the word for a better one, making choices regarding punctuation and style that you think better enhance the theme of placeholderyness. You do so, and add a little note in the {{@@[[size 0%]]@@}} commentary box reading:

&gt; @@[[size 0%]]@@
&gt; Placeholder Jim: Replaced the word &#34;super&#34; with &#34;rather&#34;, since I have a burning passion for the letter a
&gt; @@[[/size]]@@

Weird, but okay. I&#39;m not judging. Now let&#39;s say you&#39;re the original author, and someone edited your poem in a way you don&#39;t like -- perhaps changing a word that you intentionally selected. You could respond like so:

&gt; @@[[size 0%]]@@
&gt; Placeholder Jim: Replaced the word &#34;very&#34; with &#34;rather&#34;, since I have a burning passion for the letter a
&gt; @@        @@Placeholder Joe: Reverted. I chose the word &#39;super&#39; to highlight the editing process, and it needs to stay there, otherwise people will get confused
&gt; @@[[/size]]@@

The exact way in which you write/style your comments is up to you. There&#39;s not a whole load of rules as far as this goes! It&#39;s all only visible in the page source anyway -- the ultimate goal is to create a space for people to add commentary and critique to poems, collaboratively push the limits of verse, and generally have a grand old time. A few things to remember:
# Don&#39;t constantly revert other people&#39;s changes, or constantly impose your own restrictions. That&#39;s unproductive; try to reach a compromise if possible. If someone says they chose an irregular meter for a reason, take it at face value and try to figure out how to make said meter work in the poem&#39;s favour.
# Use the {{Short description of changes}} feature while editing! Let people know what you&#39;re doing, so it&#39;s easier to see who&#39;s made what changes.  
# Don&#39;t lock up the page. If you just want to read the comments, you don&#39;t need to edit; click {{+ Options}} -&gt; {{Page Source}} to view it without stopping others from editing.
That should be it! Have fun!

++++ Etched onto a solitary tomb within a crypt that has no doors

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ The Knight&#34; hide=&#34;- ... and the Dark.&#34;]]

Down in the dark and twisting deep,

    Where even evil dares not creep,

There was a man who lost his way,

    And so he closed his eyes to pray.

He reached out with his hands held high

    And loosed into the black his cry,

//“O shield of man, o warden bright,//

    //What must I do to brave this night?//

//I have no map, my lamp burns low//

    //Will you show me where I must go?”//

He listened hard, his blood was ice,

    He waited for his Lord&#39;s advice.

Then from the darkness all around

    There came a hollow, rotting sound.

It shook the air and rattled stone,

    A voice that chilled him to the bone.

//“O lonely man, you have come far,//

    //But do you know just where you are?”//

The man despite his fear and dread

    Held fast onto his will and said,

//“I am alone, that much is true,//

    //But righteousness will guide me through.//

//I seek what moves without a trace,//

    //So let us speak now face-to-face!”//

The man stood still as time crawled by,

    And then there came the foul reply.

//“Your faith cannot shield you from this,//

    //Your soul is lost in cold abyss.//

//Your prayers shall all die in vain,//

    //For now you are in my domain!”//

The lonely man, his blade gripped tight,

    Refused to flee in face of fright.

//“Although you say I cannot leave,//

    //Before this blade the shadows cleave.//

//You are a phantom, nothing more,//

    //You cannot keep me from the Door.”//

//“Pathetic, tiny, mortal man,//

    //Do you not think with ease I can?//

//I am the black, the purest end,//

    //There is no flesh I cannot rend.//

//Before me whole worlds quake in fear,//

    //And for your pride YOU WILL DIE HERE!”//

The dark then split with thund&#39;rous crash,

    A sound that ground the earth to ash,

The pit yawned wide to claim its prize,

    But once again, he closed his eyes.

Within his mind, the world was slow,

    And in the dark his blade did glow.

//“Here now I stand in darkest hall,//

    //&#39;Tis not the light that hears my call.//

//If this task falls only to me,//

    //Then I shall not turn &#39;round and flee.//

//If this is where I meet my death,//

    //Then I shall spend my final breath//

//Resisting darkness, prince of fates!//

   //ATTACK NOW, BEAST, OUR JUDGMENT WAITS!”//

He raised his sword, blade shining bright,

   And brought it down against the night.

There was a sound, sick and profane,

   The rising dark was rent in twain.

A ringing flash hung in the air;

    The beast was cast out from its lair.

And in the quiet, peaceful black

    The knight took up his blade and pack.

He knew his life would thus be spent,

    Defending souls from evil&#39;s bent.

From lonely pilgrim, seeking light,

   He had ascended, burning bright.

Upon no man would darkness prey,

    For in the Light the knight would stay.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Much more interesting than what&#39;s contained within&#34; hide=&#34;- And yet naught but a child&#39;s rhyme.&#34;]]
A long time ago, a voice did speak.
And it spoke a command, and though it were weak,
we must all obey, and this way it will stay,
until everyone’s dead, and all has decayed.

And verbatim it spoke: [[size 87%]]**‘WHAT IS, IS SO,’**[[/size]]
—this much should be plain, this much we all know—
[[size 87%]]**‘BUT THAT WHICH IS NOT HAS NO PLACE TO EXIST.’**[[/size]]
And that did complete it&#39;s ancient edict.

One bright summer’s day, a girl felt alone.
So she played with her luck, brought things that were known
to not be as such, right into our world
and the voice, again, began to unfurl.

It tore down her world, and all she built.
Golden towers fell down, revealing stone gilt.
And the world of her dreams burned away in white flame
until all that was left was just the same

[[size 90%]]as the day[[/size]]

[[size 75%]]she tried[[/size]]


[[size 60%]]to change it.[[/size]]

Now let her folly not leave you unchanged.
This all the wise know, though they know not her name.
And this isn’t disproved by those who still try,
for among us who are, none remain who’ve defied.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ The Last Words of one Considering Death&#34; hide=&#34;- Hide this&#34;]]

Day by Day I go about,
Wondering to the world all throughout,
I ask, “Is there a reason to exist other than pain? 
Should I let go and never have to feel the same?”

I wonder if it’s worth it, to be this way,
When there is an easy way out with this blade,
A simple cut done on both arms each on the same day,
Ending everything in a single way.

An easy way to escape I tell myself,
Knowing full well it does not provide a perfect way out,
Hurts others more they say,
Don’t you think I know this should not be the way to go about,
But I can’t help it don’t you think I’ve tried and still failed, 
Making me see no other option but death itself.

Doing it for attention! Doing it for fame!
That is what they say when I reach out,
“Go away, shut up, and remember your name,”
Then when it happens they seem so surprised,
They are at the hospital bed asking, “How could you? How did we not find out?”
I give them the answer, “Because you were drowning in ignorance and doubt.”

I attempt to escape and then they come back,
Trying to seem decent and not flawed, 
I ask, “Do you really love me or not at all,”
You teach me these things, “Don’t lie, Don’t be manipulative.” 
And yet I see it in you without space in the wall.

I’m racked with questions, the main one being, “Do you care?”
Or are you just here to pay the universe your share?
I don’t want to know what you think you feel,
 but when you look at me do you see love?
Or annoyance, hate, and burden.
When you have an answer come and tell,
I want to know if you are done with me or are you here for when I fell.

Is it my ending,
Or is it my beginning?
Is this my end, 
Or is it a continuation that simply has a bend?
This is what you must ask yourself day and night,
And whether or not you feel any spite

Though strange and pale,
He prays the flock
Will look past all the things he&#39;s not
And call him brother; love him as they love their own.

A cygnet walks among the ducks,
Though not without objection
&#34;Perverse is he,
And lacking, too,
In all the flock must be and do
We&#39;ve got to guide him so he&#39;ll take the path he&#39;s shown.&#34;

From zealous drakes and bitter hens
He&#39;s flooded in a noxious din.

The cynget&#39;s forced to be a duck
Through years of his oppression
But though he tries
To walk the walk
He never quite can pull it off
He falls short of the standards he could never reach.

When cygnets fail to be a duck
The ducks snap to attention
To form the chorus,
Say the line,
&#34;You screwball! Are you even trying?
Why can&#39;t you be a normal duck? It&#39;s easy for me.&#34;

But just as midnight turns to dawn
Defenseless cygnets grow to swans.

And when the swan has had enough
He takes a firm position
He pushes back
As he proclaims
&#34;To hell with all your dirty games!
I am no duck! I am a swan! If you don&#39;t like it-- fuck off!&#34;

But what one bird calls standing ground
Another calls sedition
They stare aghast
At his remarks
And tell him &#34;You are FAR too harsh!
Why can&#39;t you be respectful to our humble flock?&#34;

But they were the ones who started the war
And this swan will stay mute no more.
