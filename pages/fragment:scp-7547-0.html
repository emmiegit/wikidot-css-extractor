    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Item #:** SCP-7547

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7547 has not been removed from the scene of its initial discovery.

**Description:** SCP-7547 is a severed human head impaled on a wooden pike. The object induces a hallucinatory effect causing observers to see SCP-7547 as the head of a close loved one.

**Discovery:** On 14/07/2019, the Boston police department was notified that a murder had taken place. The victim&#39;s head, SCP-7547, was displayed in front of the Reality Church of Boston, with their body lying nearby. Upon the discovery of the head&#39;s anomalous properties, jurisdiction over the investigation was transferred to the SCP Foundation. Adam Engle was chosen as investigator.

//(The sound of a door opening and closing.)//

**Engle:** Oh, hey.

**Voice:**[[footnote]]Later identified as Agent Daniel Cho.[[/footnote]] Just one of those days, huh? 

**Engle:** I won’t say I disagree.

**Cho:** Got some more files for you.

//(The sound of a stack of papers impacting the desk.)//

**Engle:** Thanks.

**Cho:** So what’re you thinking? Anart piece? Some kind of ritual?

**Engle:** Well, Forensics haven’t gotten back with the victim’s identity, so could be anything, really. It might be a crime of passion, if the anomalous properties are anything to go by.

**Cho:** Oh, yeah, makes it a pain in the ass to deal with. I keep seeing– //(coughs)// I keep seeing people in Forensics having to step away, tears in their face. And I mean I don’t blame them, like, I know it’s fake, but doesn’t change the fact it looks like my fiancé’s severed head on a pike. Say, what does it look like to you?

**Engle:** …I’d rather not talk about it.

**Cho:** Fair enough. Sorry for bringing it up.

**Engle:** It’s fine.

//(Pause.)//

**Cho:** Welp, I’m gonna head back. See you later, man.

**Engle:** Bye.

//(The sound of a door opening and closing.)//

//(Shuffling papers. Engle mumbles something unintelligible in a sing-song tone.)//

**Engle:** Hel-

**Unknown Voice:**[[footnote]]Identity Unknown. Voice is tinny with a high pitch.[[/footnote]] The ball has been set in motion.

**Engle:** Excuse me?

**Unknown Voice:** Listen well, we won’t repeat this twice. 14/07/2012, Portland, Maine. Remember it? It should be fresh in your mind.

**Engle:** …What is this?

**Unknown Voice:** Trust everyone and no one. It is perpetual motion run amok, but the flight plan can be adjusted. Find a map.

//(The phone line disconnects, playing a dull tone.)//

**Engle:** …
