**Item #:** SCP-2343

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2343 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at [http://www.scp-wiki.net/secure-facility-dossier-site-88 Site-88]. Amenity requests are subject to approval from the 2343 Project Director. Due to the object&#39;s voluntary containment, the continued cooperation of SCP-2343 is a top priority.[[footnote]]Use of SCP-2343 as a possible translator for [[[SCP-2280]]] is currently pending review.[[/footnote]]

Subject was transferred to Foundation custody on September 5th.

##BA0011|- Listen up you sideways assholes##

&gt; I know you&#39;ll notice this before the end of the day, so pass it up the chain.
&gt; 
&gt; You folk spend your entire lives worried about what you&#39;ve got locked up. But it ain&#39;t what&#39;s on the inside that&#39;s going to get you. It&#39;s what&#39;s still outside. You know how my wife used to knock me around? I&#39;ve been taking it for a few thousand years so the rest of you ungrateful assholes could build something. If she finds out I&#39;m down here, if she finds out what you done, she won&#39;t stop until the whole damn world is drownin&#39; in blood. She done it before, and she&#39;ll do it again.
&gt; 
&gt; But y&#39;all ain&#39;t gonna let me out. That&#39;s fine. Was my own pride got me in this mess anyway. I&#39;ll help you find her, and you can lock her up like you locked me up. Elsewise y&#39;all die and I&#39;m left to make the world all over again from the ashes. I&#39;m old, I&#39;m tired, and I don&#39;t know if I got another run left in me. This&#39;s what I&#39;m offerin&#39;. Take it or leave it.</textarea></pre>
