//Click, click, clack, ding!//

He pushed the carriage return lever to the right. His hands returned to the typewriter&#39;s well-worn keys in front of him. The typebars pounded on the delivery note form in a steady rhythm as he filled out the page, which had already been through a Xerox machine far too many times. The crisp font is long degraded by round after round of copying.

But Stuart Barlow did not care. He could have just gone down the hall and gotten a new copy of the form, but he didn&#39;t. There was a Xerox workstation next to his in the office and a routine weapons delivery was just not worth the effort. This form would have to do. His eyes kept wandering from the supply order on the desk to the form in his hands, constantly checking to make sure he had not missed a single letter. One letter would be all it took to turn this simple delivery into a violation of a UN Security Council embargo.

He noticed a typo in the address. //Goddammit//, he thought to himself, crumpling the form in frustration. Turning left to throw the now-useless form into the trash bin, he noticed a man leaning against the doorframe of his office.

&#34;Excuse me&#34;, the man said while stepping into Stuart&#39;s office. There was a spot of dust where he leaned against the doorframe. He dusted off his gray suit and gave Stuart a polite smile. &#34;You should really clean up your office&#34;, he admonished.

Stuart furrowed his eyebrows and observed the unwelcomed intruder while concealing the forms on his table. &#34;Get out of my office. Send me a written request if you want something from me.&#34;

&#34;I hope that I&#39;m not disturbing you. But I am here to request something&#34;, he said, ignoring Stuart&#39;s objection. The man stepped to Stuart&#39;s table and tried to pick up a folder on the desk. But Stuart stood up in rage and hit the folder with his flat hand, pinning it to the table.

&#34;Who do you think you are? Last chance! Get out of my office or I will call some security officers that will lead you the way out of the door!&#34; Barked Stuart at the intruder.

The man did not flinch at Stuart&#39;s outburst. He let go of the document calmly and answered.

&#34;I&#39;m Howell Porter, member of the Threat Evasion division and panel head of the permanent 638/Fidel panel. Howell is sufficient-&#34;

&#34;What do I car-&#34;, interrupted Stuart. Only for Howell to hit the desk and to lean forward to Stuart. Howell&#39;s smile faded. His facial expressions started to reflect the stern appearance of his outfit.

&#34;You //will// care and you //will// hear me out. You were transferred to my panel and we have already arranged for a substitute. Your skills may have let you be the big fish here, but you swim in my waters now. You got that?&#34; asserted Howell.

Howell&#39;s retort sent shivers down Stuart&#39;s spine and left him with goosebumps. He nodded and tried to collect himself. His interlocutor returned a smile.

&#34;Good. Just follow me and I will explain everything to you.&#34;

The sound of dozens of typewriters accompanied them down the halls of the Logistics Division. Only when a worker ventured to take a look at this unexpected sight did the noises stop. They were difficult to miss. Stuart&#39;s mustard turtleneck sweater and washed-out trousers stood in stark contrast to his gray suit-wearing companion&#39;s stern appearance.

&#34;What does a Threat Evasion agent do in Logistics? A written request would have been enough&#34;, asked Stuart.

&#34;I was about to until I looked up your disciplinary records. Being down to earth is a necessity if you don&#39;t want to be a burden on our panel. Consider my presence as a part of your behavior Bootcamp.&#34;

Howell said while retrieving two documents from his briefcase.

&#34;I also want you to read those.&#34;

Dear Mr. Helms.
We have noticed an increase in activity under Operation Mongoose. As of this writing, there had been 180 attempted assassinations under the current US administration. Overshadowing the total number of attempts made by the previous three administrations.
We would like to inform you that Fidel Castro is a close ally of the Foundation and that any further hostility on your part will necessitate consequences on our part.

He held the papers out to Stuart who grabbed and skimmed them. His gaze swept over the contents of the letters that had been handed to him. Taking in and processing every last piece of information available. Stuart felt a surge of happiness. This was a welcome break from his monotonous work.

&#34;External Affair&#39;s negotiations failed. Who would have guessed it?&#34; Howell&#39;s cynicism was palpable. It came close to leaving a trail in the air.

&#34;When negotiations fall through, Advanced Diplomacy is called in. It&#39;s the same old story. If you want to blackmail or assassinate the CIA Director, you don&#39;t need a pencil pusher like me.&#34;

&#34;Don&#39;t play yourself down like that. You concealed a delivery of biological weapons in operation Stork Flight, guiding a cargo airplane through a no-fly zone no less. No pencil pusher could do that, you have talent.&#34;

&#34;So I wasn&#39;t chosen at random after all.&#34;

&#34;Let&#39;s just say that I asked a couple of people if they know someone with your abilities.&#34;

They reached the end of the corridor and entered the department&#39;s entrance hall. With a steady pace, they walked past the entrance counters, which were sandwiched between two sets of stairs. A large emblem with the words //Department of Advanced Diplomacy// carved into the wall behind them reigns above the secretary&#39;s heads. Everyone entering the hall knew exactly who was running this place.

Stuart gave an appreciative nod to the workers behind the counters before following Anderson up the left stairwell. They pushed open the heavy double doors that were embellished by the //Threat Evasion Division// label above the doorframe.

&#34;Welcome to your new workplace!&#34; Howell said while patting Andrew on the back.
But Stuart didn&#39;t seem to notice Howell. He was too preoccupied with the new environment in which he found himself. A meeting was revealed to him through the blinds on his left. Someone stood at the head of the table with a pointing stick, emphasizing certain regions on the map projected on the wall behind him. Most likely in eastern Africa. If Stuart&#39;s geography knowledge hadn&#39;t failed him.

&#34;Mr. Barlow, snap out of it,&#34; Howell admonished.

&#34;Sorry, sir. What were we talking about?&#34;

&#34;About the work that is ahead of you.&#34;

&#34;So what is it? Should I ship unmarked guns to some friends of ours?&#34;

&#34;If it was only so easy. We need a more elegant solution. But you will understand soon.&#34;

Howell handed Andrew a folder that he had taken from his briefcase. They reached a small lounge midst the plotting and scheming in the surrounding offices. Stuart and Howell took their seats, as Howell started going through the files.

__**Project Head:**__ Howell Porter

__**History:**__ On 1959-01-22, three weeks after Fidel Castro&#39;s successful revolution, Cuban miners found an anomalous mineral near the city of Trinidad, Cuba. Agents from the Foundation noticed an increase in unusual activities near the mining sites soon after this discovery.
[[include component:image-block

]]

Negotiations with the Cuban government began, and the Foundation was able to draft the Trinidad Protocol, which is now in effect. Any mining or distribution of //Fluchstein// will be prohibited, in exchange for the construction of a Foundation Site in Cuba, which will provide employment and a stable source of foreign currency.

The Central Intelligence Office of the United States of America planned and executed failed assassination attempts on Cuban President Fidel Castro due to ideological and militaristic tensions.

At the time of writing, there have been 332 attempts in total.

*38 under the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration.
*42 under the John F. Kennedy administration.
*72 under the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.
*180 under the Richard Nixon administration.

Assassination attempts included methods of:

*Poisoning cigars.
*Distribution of mines on beaches frequently visited by Castro.
*Rigging a public stage with explosives.


__**Analysis:**__
Mining equipment has been seen moving out of a now-established exclusion zone at Site 638-T, according to observations. The current Cuban government has approved the construction of a Foundation outpost on the exclusion zone&#39;s outskirts. This offer was not included in the Trinidad Protocol and was considered a trusting gesture.
Living standards in Trinidad and the surrounding areas have improved as a result of foundation efforts and employment.

It is the Department&#39;s firm view that there is a controllable risk that the Cuban government will fail to comply with the Trinidad Protocol. The Trinidad Protocol&#39;s benefits are mutual, and a breach would result in massive financial losses for the local economy with no visible benefits.

An intercepted communication between PENTAGRAM [[footnote]] The occult branch of the Department of Defense [[/footnote]] and the current US administration revealed that involved parties know about Site 638-T, the Trinidad Protocol, and //Fluchstein&#39;s// anomalous properties. Said Communications involved speculations about the utility of //Fluchstein// as a weapon.

It is the Department&#39;s firm view that the US government has an interest in mining at Site 638-T and will not follow the Trinidad Protocol. An installation of a US-friendly regime in Cuba would be detrimental to Foundation efforts.

It is the Department&#39;s firm view that the assassination methods deployed by the CIA are escalating in scope and therefore getting harder to sabotage. These developments are to continue and are therefore endangering Foundation protection efforts if not intervened on.


__**PROPOSAL:**__ It is the Department&#39;s suggested course of action that the permanent panel 638/Fidel is to be expanded. The aforementioned panel is tasked with maintaining the well-being of Fidel Castro as long as he follows the Trinidad Protocol or a more suitable partner is found.
The permanent panel 638/Fidel is to increase infiltration operations into the Central Intelligence Agency and Fidel Castro&#39;s lifeguards to reach this goal. Any attempt by the CIA that would lead to rendering the Cuban government unable to uphold a ban of excavations and mining surrounding Site 638-T is to be sabotaged. Measures to lessen the total number of such attempts are to be investigated and presented to 05-command for further considerations.

Following an assessment of the permanent panel 638/Fidel deeming another subject capable of upholding the Trinidad Protocol whose policies reach a score higher than 23 on the Rousseau-Sartre [[footnote]] A scale from 0 to 100 indicating the probability of future political instability. 0 indicates the highest level of instability. [[/footnote]] scale, all protection efforts are to cease. Said subject is to be installed as the head of government after the successful removal of Fidel Castro.

Stuart mumbled to himself as he took a brief look at his transfer notes, notices of a new clearance level, and other bureaucratic acts that he despised.

&#34;I have some questions&#34;, he stated.

&#34;Ask right away. I don&#39;t bite. Well, most of the time.&#34;

Howell got into motion as did Stuart. They walked down the Lounge through a door labeled //Utilities//.

&#34;So, you are doing this for...uhm&#34; Stuart shuffled through the pages &#34;12 years by now. Why do you need a logistics expert all of the sudden?&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s a good question. I //could// answer it, but I do believe that showing you would be easier.&#34;

Howell explained as they walked down the corridor. Passing doors they reached a door with the words //638/Fidel panel members only// on it. Howell walked over to the table next to the door and wrote down his name, date, and entry time on a form.

He laid down the pen and took some gloves and hairnets from the box besides the form. Handing some of them to Stuart.

&#34;Put them on. We don&#39;t want to contaminate the cargo.&#34;

Howell gave him a wink, took out a key from his pocket, and opened the heavy, steel-clad door.

&#34;We want you to deliver those.&#34;

The swinging door revealed the sight of folders, documents, and files. Stacked shoulder-high on top of each other over a couple of tables, forming a paper forest. Specifications were attached to clipboards, laying on their respective tables in front of the papers. Howell pointed at one of the clipboards.

&#34;Go ahead, they aren&#39;t there to just collect dust.&#34;

Without any hesitation, Stuart grabbed a clipboard and absorbed its content. Howell could see his confusion as Stuart laid down the clipboard and walked to the next.
 
Five minutes passed. Then ten and finally at fifteen, Stuart stepped up to Howell.

&#34;What is this all about? Those are no delivery forms. Floor plans, shift rotations, and //placement locations// down to single cupboards. What do you //actually// want from me? Stop leaving me in the dark!&#34;

Howell smiled and placed his right hand on Stuart&#39;s shoulder.

&#34;Let us calm down for a bit, ok? Yes, you are right. One could argue that //deliver// does not hit the mark. I think that technically the right term would be //to plant evidence//.&#34;

Stuart tilted his head and looked at Howell who started to laugh.

&#34;Now look at me. In the end, I&#39;m explaining it to you after all.&#34;

&#34;Well, I&#39;m waiting.&#34;

&#34;You need to learn to be patient, Mr. Barlow. So how about I explain it to you while we get to your new colleagues.&#34;

Both of them left the room, threw the gloves and hairnets in the trash bin next to the door, and walked down the way they have come from.

&#34;So, I get that you, we, whatever, are protecting Fidel Castro.&#34;

&#34;Mhm,&#34; mumbled Howell as he nodded.

&#34;I also get that currently, the protection is using up most of your resources and noticeably your nerves.&#34;

&#34;One could say that.&#34;

&#34;What I don&#39;t get is how this would change if you plant evidence and blackmail the CIA director. Do you think anything will change by that? The higher-ups will just replace him if he doesn&#39;t deliver.&#34;

&#34;I see where the confusion is coming from now, Mr. Barlow. We are not planning to blackmail Mr. Helmes. We are not planning to blackmail at all.&#34;

&#34;Can you please tell me for once what you //are// doing and not what you //aren&#39;t//?&#34;

&#34;How about some //what we know//? We know that this was not started by the CIA and we also know that the US government is aware of Site 638-T. The pressure to assassinate Castro is coming from way above. We don&#39;t know exactly why, but we suspect them to have an interest in acquiring the minerals present at 638-T for weapons production.&#34;

&#34;I can read. I understand the analysis paper. But it does not explain this course of action.&#34;

&#34;We need to work on that temper of yours. Bad tempers can turn friends into enemies and enemies seldomly act in your favor. This counts double if you have something to hide and triple if you are influential.&#34;

&#34;You found some dirt in the administration&#39;s basement, didn&#39;t you?&#34;

&#34;Exactly, but unfortunately only so much that could be resolved by a well-targeted PR campaign if the dirt was to surface.&#34;

&#34;Planting evidence, you said. We are burying additional corpses in the basement.&#34;

Howell smiles at Stuart and patted him on the shoulder.

&#34;Now you are getting there. They thought that bribes, misappropriation of public funds, and some spying on their enemies would secure their victory at the elections. It was their trump card, but also their only one. One should never bet everything on one horse.&#34;

&#34;But aren&#39;t we doing the same? We inflate their schemes so that no PR campaign possible could help them. What if that fails?&#34;

&#34;No worries, Mr. Barlow. This is not my first walk down the division hallways with new panel members. We developed multiple plans in our team. Speaking of which.&#34;

After finally grasping what they are planning, Stuart stood before an office. //Permanent panel 638/Fidel//.

&#34;You are a quick learner, Mr. Barlow. I think your demeanor has changed for the better. Good enough to work together with your colleagues. So, get started! Get to know them, find your place in the panel, and start planning. We only have four weeks left until our agents leave for Watergate.&#34;

They both entered the office and the door closed behind them.
