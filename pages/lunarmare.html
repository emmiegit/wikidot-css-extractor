Ian asked if I was dreaming.
@@@@
@@@@
She thought I was still babbling in my dream, in the dreams she was getting water for me.

I did not deceive you, I&#39;m still staying at Lunar Mare. I was too slow, too slow that I could not see you.

Stroke the water, the water pulled away, breathing slyly.

I really have to leave. Setting off from Lunar Mare can save me more fuel, I would be better off that way.

I told her everything, whether she believes it or not——in here, my mind becomes slow, but it doesn&#39;t affect my subjective feelings.

It is stunning. In the dreams Ian got me water, crystal clear under the moonlight——

Now that the surface of the moon is dark.

Or, I have left light for long, now there&#39;s only darkness left.

Ian asked me how long I&#39;ll go.
@@@@
@@@@
Darling, it&#39;s hard for me to explain——my time flow will keep on dilating, daughter will say I&#39;m like a shooting star, granddaughter will say I&#39;m like a sticker, great granddaughter will say I&#39;m like the hill she had drawn (my wave form), and the remaining will tell you that I don&#39;t exist.

I did not deceive you, I&#39;m still staying at Lunar Mare. I didn&#39;t stop, still not enough time to keep up with myself.

When Ian&#39;s tears evaporate away, the ground control announced the project had overcome two of a thousand of the speed of light.

When Ian&#39;s photograph was just taken out for getting tarnished, the relative speed of the cabin is enough to escape every neutron star.

After Ian&#39;s name was mentioned by our daughter, being mentioned by our granddaughter, being mentioned by our great granddaughter,

Being mentioned by everyone,

I&#39;ll reach the speed of light.

You see, my time has stopped.
@@@@
@@@@
Darling, it&#39;s hard for me to explain——my nebula melted in the deep skies, dispersing into superclusters, clusters, galaxy groups and galaxies, into red-shifting dust.

Comets fall into planets, planets fall into stars, stars fall into accretion disks, fall into Hawking radiations.

A sea of boson dried up in front of my eyes, color charge wandering among dead bodies of quarks, glitters sparkling unpredictably.

Stroke the water, the water opened to me, breathing calmly.

I did not deceive you, I&#39;m still staying at Lunar Mare.

Setting off from Lunar Mare, I&#39;ve exhausted all of my fuel, no way to decelerate or change the direction.

I&#39;m inevitably slipping towards the heat death.

Everything I loved and are to love are left at Lunar Mare.

This moment I&#39;m still babbling in my dream, and you&#39;re getting me water.

I wait for you to think with me at the same moment, dispelling my loneliness, ending my pushing questions.

Find me from Lunar Mare.
