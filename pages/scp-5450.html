**Special Containment Procedures:** Production of SCP-5450 instances are outlawed in the city of Guangdong, China. Governmental sanctions have been instated to outlaw hunting of instances of SCP-5450-1. Foundation web crawlers have been installed to flag down any mention of SCP-5450 or SCP-5450-1, any publication of material of SCP-5450 is to be falsified as a myth via disinformation campaigns.

**Description:** SCP-5450 is a recipe known as shark fin soup, which manifests anomalous properties when produced from sharks within the Guangdong region.  Selachians within this area, now designated SCP-5450-1, are biologically indistinguishable from normal sharks barring the presence of a pair of lungs. The anomalous property of SCP-5450 is that upon consumption the subject will become a species of selachian with varying results. Upon taking on the new form, the newly transformed subject will find its way to a body of water via currently unknown means. A small amount of cases have shown the individuals to move their fins in a way similar to walking. Testing has been preemptively denied via the Site Director Jorge Clark as the effects of SCP-5450 are well documented and apparent.
@@ @@
**Discovery:** SCP-5450 was discovered when several families went missing in Guangdong followed by several reports of walking sharks online. Witnesses to instances of SCP-5450-1 were promptly amnesized and returned. Currently as of 06/07/2019, there is an estimated count of 452 instances of SCP-5450-1, making them an endangered species.

**Notes:** On 04/29/2019, Foundation web crawlers flagged an advertisement. A transcription of the advertisement is attached:

&gt; [[size 150%]] ##lightblue|Shark Fin Soup, by residents of Guangdong!##
&gt; ##orange|A soup made for slurping!
&gt; Partake in a delicacy, by our finest

The advertisement was immediately taken down upon flagging. Memetic agents were found, however, a source has yet to be identified.
**Addendum-SCP-5450.1:** Following reports of a man punching a shark, Foundation Marine Biologist Kevin Drant and a team of Marine specialists were dispatched to the location, a shipwreck off the coast of Guangdong. Kevin&#39;s team noted that the following messages attached were crudely scratched into the ship&#39;s hull. Later the messages were translated into English and attached to the document.
