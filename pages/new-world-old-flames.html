A woman in a dark blue traveling cloak sat alone in the bar, apparently oblivious to the time passing around her. Unmoving and seemingly unbreathing, she blended into the bustling scenery of The Never&#39;n Not as though she was carved from the same piece of driftwood as the bar top. Though the cloak was pulled tight around her, onlookers couldn&#39;t help but notice the swirling electric blue runes and symbols covering her. From the mug held tightly in her hands, they almost seemed to draw one&#39;s eye up her arms, across her collarbones and ending in a blue band running from her forehead to her chin across her left eye.

&#34;Gon&#39; orda anyting else, Daywalla?&#34; asked the barkeep, pausing from cleaning a mug with a very dingy rag.

&#34;Depends. Do you have ouzo? Or really, anything that isn&#39;t watery beer or made from potatoes?&#34;

&#34;Depens. Ya alway so picky?&#34;

The woman loosened her grip on her mug. &#34;Sorry. I just... I found out somebody close to me had passed on.&#34;

&#34;My condolences.&#34; The barkeep raised an eyebrow. &#34;If ya lookin&#39; fa someting ta drink that&#39;s more... filling for someun like yourself, might I suggest payin&#39; a visit to the Darkwater Lodge?&#34;

The woman smiled, revealing a long, sharp canine. &#34;Thanks, I&#39;ll keep that in mind.&#34;

Standing, she slid an ancient gold coin across the bar.  

------

//This... This is wrong.// Thought the woman as she walked away from the Darkwater Lodge&#39;s gates. Tilting the styrofoam cup towards her, she could just see the corner of the IV bag poking underneath the lid. //Why would you serve it in a styrofoam cup?// Enu Duvernay had recommended she drink it there, but she&#39;d had reservations. Most Karcists she&#39;d known had an unhealthy fascination with what they called, &#34;Night Walkers&#34; or &#34;Blood Striders,&#34; and she had long since learned not to trust anyone who&#39;s first instinct was to call you a //blood strider.//

&#34;Come see Steely Dan&#39;s House of Greek Artifacts, Roman Trinkets, and Homeopathic Medicines! Untold wonders lie behind those doors! Relics from Ages Forgotten!&#34; The voice of the young crier cut through her thoughts and the bustle of the market. The woman turned to see a boy of no more than ten, standing on a box and waving flyers like a paperboy in turn of the century Manhatten. Crossing the thoroughfare, she looked him over.

&#34;Mornin&#39; mum. Would you like a ticket?&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m not sure. What&#39;s in the house?&#34;

&#34;Jus bout everyting&#39;. Is like Ripley&#39;s Believe It or Not.&#34;

She laughed. &#34;I met Ripley once. Trust me, that&#39;s not a nice thing to say about your boss.&#34;

&#34;Jus followin&#39; my script.&#34; shrugged the boy. &#34;It&#39;s two streets over. Can&#39;t miss it.&#34;

&#34;Well. I&#39;ll tell them you sent me.&#34;

------

With its second level jutting out over the street far further than most building codes would have allowed, the woman had no trouble finding her destination. Surrounded by a disorganized mess of semi burnt out bulbs, the only sign simply read;

&gt; Stele Dan&#39;s
&gt; House of Wonders

Pushing through the mahogany door, she walked into the gift shop just as a tour was finishing up. Voice somewhat muffled by a helmet and wearing scraps of armor from across the centuries, the guide dipped into a deep bow and gestured towards the gift shop.

&#34;I must thank you so much for your patronage. I hope you had an amazing time, and the next time you find your curiosity piqued, you know where to find me. Enjoy your time in La Rue Macabre.&#34;

The woman leaned on the table as the group shuffled out. Still oblivious to her entrance, the guide stared at the swinging door.

&#34;Not a damn thing. Didn&#39;t even look around. Fuck me.&#34; He started to pull off his helmet, a hoplite helmet from one of Greece&#39;s innumerable wars. &#34;Next tours in fifteen, no, make that twenty minutes, I&#39;ve gotta get a bite to...&#34; He stared at the woman, mouth open.

&#34;By the Styx, how the fuck are you still alive, Arabel?&#34;

&#34;Come on, Damocles. That&#39;s no way to treat an old friend.&#34;

------

After he&#39;d shut down the museum, Damocles ushered Arabel into a room off to the side.

&#34;A curious... occupation to have, Damocles.&#34;

Damocles opened up a cupboard. &#34;Actually, I changed it. To Dan.&#34;

&#34;Danocles?&#34;

He laughed. &#34;No. Just Dan. I had to blend in. And I got really sick of people asking &#39;//like the fable?//&#39; and whatnot. What did you think of the sign?&#34;

Arabel crossed her legs. &#34;I&#39;ve been alive for three thousand years and it&#39;s one of the worst jokes I&#39;ve ever heard. I hate it as much as I did your wordplay.&#34;

Dan turned to look at her. &#34;So you would have... //Pict// something different?&#34;

&#34;I am perfectly capable of killing you.&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m aware. That&#39;s what makes it fun.&#34; Dan ignited the stove with a snap and put a kettle on. &#34;So what brings you to La Rue Macabre?&#34;

&#34;Ares.&#34;

&#34;And since you&#39;re here and not sprinting west, I&#39;m guessing you already...&#34;

Arabel nodded. &#34;One of those //Bayou// Boys told me what I needed to know.&#34;

Dan wore a melancholy smile. &#34;Perhaps it&#39;s for the best. This world is no place for old warriors. It&#39;s not more civilized, by any means. Just more wrong in ways we could never have fixed.&#34;

There was silence for a few minutes before Dan spoke again.

&#34;But what I want to know is how you survived. Last time I saw you, you were holding off the Mad God of War by yourself so everyone else could evacuate the towns and villages... And I felt you die. You were a stellar warrior mage, but just a novice channeler.&#34;

Arabel showed him her elongated canines. &#34;Carmilla.&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s just like fucking vampyres, ruining a heroic death with the curse of undeath.&#34; He paused. &#34;No offense.&#34;

&#34;None taken. It&#39;s not as bad as you think.&#34;

&#34;Drinking human blood out of... is that a styrofoam coffee cup? Well, that isn&#39;t my idea of a good life.&#34;

&#34;I get by. Carmilla runs every blood bank in Europe, so it&#39;s not like we&#39;re out there killing people.&#34;

The kettle whistled and Dan stood up. &#34;I&#39;ll sleep easier knowing my long lost friend isn&#39;t murdering people in back alleys.&#34;

&#34;I&#39;ve not known you to be one to sleep. Especially with a collection this large to manage.&#34;

Dan shrugged. &#34;It started out small. Just trophies and oddities.&#34;

&#34;And then it blossomed into what I can only imagine is a health and safety hazard to rival all others?&#34;

&#34;Hey, I&#39;ve got about a square mile of footage in here. All organized and archived.&#34;

&#34;Dear Gods, no wonder nobody bought anything. They had to walk... Well, however long a square mile is in metric.&#34;

Dan counted on his fingers and cocked his head at Arabel. &#34;I&#39;m gonna say... maybe twoish square kilometers? I should know this, I was in France when they made the metric system.&#34;

&#34;Really? Me too.&#34;

Dan smirked and stood as the kettle began to whistle. &#34;I imagine that the thought of necks spurting blood would be hard to resist. What with all the,&#34; he made a chopping motion with his hand, &#34;going on.&#34;

&#34;Ass. The Court was sending as much food as they could to help the people. I wanted to help and Carmilla wanted to secure an ally with whoever came out on top.&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s nice to hear that death hasn&#39;t cured you of your idealism. But as I was saying, most of the building is my personal collection and library.&#34;

&#34;How did you get all this stuff? You never seemed materialistic back in the day.&#34; asked Arabel.

&#34;Well, after the day we thought you died, everyone just kind of drifted apart. I guess it&#39;s just my way of hanging on to the memories. As for the sheer volume, I followed the seat of power. Athens, Rome, Spain, the British Empire, and now here.&#34;

&#34;Just keeping up a collection or?&#34;

&#34;Believe it or not, but I actually am responsible for a good chunk of the surviving Greek and Roman tales. I mean, I didn&#39;t write them, but I remembered them and put them places for other people to find.&#34;

Arabel chuckled. &#34;Heroic Dan. Keeping the flame of knowledge lit through the Dark Ages... I&#39;m guessing you left us all out on purpose.&#34;

Dan didn&#39;t respond for a moment. &#34;I... I actually censored somethings. Or kept others. A misattribution here, a name change there.&#34;

&#34;I don&#39;t blame you.&#34;

Dan turned around, holding two mugs of tea. Placing one in front of Arabel, he settled back into his chair. Arabel raised her mug.

&#34;To Absent Friends.&#34;

&#34;And the Roads We Walk to Find Them.&#34;
