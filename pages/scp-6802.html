**Item Number:** 6802

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6802 is to be contained in a standard animal containment cell, and be provided standard-grade dog kibble twice a day. SCP-6802 may be provided with a low-sodium broth as reward for good behavior. Once a month, a trained pet groomer should trim SCP-6802&#39;s fur and claws, with assistance from a handler.

Upon entering a seeking state, a Junior Researcher is assigned to accompany SCP-6802. If no staff are on call for SCP-6802&#39;s seeking state, the nearest willing staff member of site is asked to fulfill the role. During a seeking state, SCP-6802 has access to much of the site, including the public dormitories, cafeteria, and kitchen; a full list is available in Document 6802-B.

Caches of 300 liter barrels should be placed around Site 18 in safe areas. For enrichment purposes, they should be shuffled regularly.

**Description:** SCP-6802 is a large dog, most closely resembling a golden retriever. It wears a green harness and attached leash which is superficially similar to those of service dogs used by handicapped individuals, proclaiming SCP-6802 to be a &#34;SOUP DOG&#34;. Research has shown no such division has ever been classified by the Americans with Disabilities Act, Britain&#39;s Equality Act of 2010, New Zealand&#39;s Dog Control Act 1996, or any other such political body. While the harness may be removed via traditional means, this appears to cause SCP-6802 emotional distress and has been forbidden outside of testing.

SCP-6802 behaves like a non-anomalous dog until it enters a seeking state, which occurs randomly approximately 3-4 times a week. During a seeking state, SCP-6802 seems to be in a state of considerable duress, often pacing, whining, and barking for attention. Upon viewing SCP-6802, individuals will universally perceive SCP-6802 as &#34;wanting soup&#34;. The individual will attempt to take hold of SCP-6802&#39;s leash and walk with it to find soup, prioritizing the safety of SCP-6802, themselves, and obtaining soup in that order respectively. The seeking state will continue until SCP-6802 locates soup in a form and temperature that is consumable. 

Upon finding soup, SCP-6802 will begin forcefully inhaling it at intake speeds of up to 100 liters a second, approximately the rate of an average commercial fire hose. Upon consuming the soup, SCP-6802 will re-enter a seeking state, continuing until it has inhaled a total of approximately 120 liters of soup. At this point, it will return to normal behavior and can be escorted back to its containment cell.

If left in a seeking state, SCP-6802&#39;s need for soup will increase over time, eventually attempting containment breaches to obtain soup. The strength with which observers are compelled to help it also increases, eventually leading to SCP-6802 becoming a Class-4 memetic hazard after approximately 3 hours of an unattended seeking state.

After a battery of tests, SCP-6802&#39;s favorite soup was confirmed to be Campbell&#39;s Classic Chunky Chicken Noodle Soup.

**Item №**: VNP-6802 – //previously designated as [*/scp-6802 SCP-6802]//

**Specification**: Golden retriever which consumes anomalous amounts of soup at incredible speeds.
**Normalization Protocols**: VNP-6802 co-habitates with a junior researcher at ████, ████. Once a week, it is brought to Vanguard site 76 to consume the contents of [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-348 VNP-348], which continually fills until VNP-6802 is sated.

After each consumption, VNP-348 manifests a small pictogram of a smiling dog being pet.
