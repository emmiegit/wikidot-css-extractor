It&#39;s Halloween.

When humans follow a pointlessly old tradition of scaring away spirits with badly made costumes.

Alright, fine. We follow pointless traditions too, like crucifying food before consumption during harvest. But at least it doesn&#39;t look like a bunch of badly dressed idiots who think they look like monsters asking for sugar door-to-door.

//Sigh//, fine. We do look like badly made monstrosities sometimes. At least we aren&#39;t idiots.

What do you mean the Halkost are sometimes dumb? They occasionally forget to grow eyes and walk into walls and assimilate themselves, but at least I don&#39;t do that.

Don&#39;t give me that look, I swear that time was an accident.

Although it was a pretty idiotic idea to take that bet, especially one during All Hallow&#39;s eve.

Yes, I&#39;m sure you already know how this goes.

__

Humans are idiots, really. I go around with half my body being a constrictor, and nobody bats an eye because it&#39;s Halloween. Seriously, nobody even questioned how I moved the thing.

Anyway, I&#39;m here to, I quote, &#34;survey the surrounding area.&#34;

I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s just to get me wondering around a crowded human area to see what would happen. Nothing, apparently. Which is boring, I miss the times humans dug out their own eyes at the mere sight of me. Messy, but they weren&#39;t very well-liked humans, anyway.

All I see are candles dedicated to the dead, lining the Church&#39;s… well, everything. Walls, floor, tables. And there&#39;re children with baskets full of candy. And there&#39;re buckets full of apples. I&#39;m sure if I try to fish them out, I&#39;ll bite the bucket in half.

It&#39;s the start of Allhallowtide, too. I wish we had something like this, but really, we don&#39;t have many dead saints. I&#39;ll rather not die, thank you very much. Being celebrated for being dead isn&#39;t my sort of thing.

Kind of boring here, perhaps I should retur-

Wait a second, now that&#39;s an interesting costume.

It has gears //seemingly// implanted into the arm and face, with a copper-coloured cloak to match. It is //most definitely// a normal person in Halloween. I mean, there&#39;re even ticking noises to match.

Oh darn, he&#39;s looking this way. Better let the tail go limp. This is most certainly a normal tail prop. The horns are clearly plastic, nevermind the suspiciously red substance covering it. And time to pull out the emergency apple.

&#34;Excuse m- Oh sorry! I thought you were someone else.&#34;

I give a nonchalant reply of: &#34;Hm, oh.&#34;

I&#39;m not very good at conversations.

Silence. He&#39;s still standing around. I wonder why. Is it that interesting to stand next to a snake-woman with red-stained claws and horns?

Without much thought, I blurt out, &#34;You waiting for someone?&#34;

&#34;Yes, miss. My daughter, you see, said she&#39;ll meet me here. Went for a round of trick-or-treating, like all the others. Quite a nice costume you have there, by the way.&#34;

&#34;Thanks, same for you.&#34;

More silence.

&#34;So, what do you think I am?&#34;

&#34;A priest.&#34;

I didn&#39;t realise my error until much later. Maybe I am an idiot.

&#34;A priest, hm? Interesting answer. I suppose you look like, well, how do I say this… In English, I would say a saint.&#34;

This ticking is getting more unnerving by the second. I don&#39;t like where this is going.

&#34;A saint? I look like something quite the opposite, you know.&#34;

&#34;Saints don&#39;t have to look good. Ours definitely doesn&#39;t.&#34;

Oh screw it. He probably already realised it.

&#34;I look like a monster. At least yours looks like something well polished, literally.&#34;

&#34;You clearly haven&#39;t seen him without the polish. We&#39;re all human inside after all, don&#39;t you agree? Even with all the costumes, we&#39;re all the same. Don&#39;t judge a book by it&#39;s cover, nor classify it by the title.&#34;

&#34;I guess so.&#34;

Oh look, his daughter is back, wearing a cloak and with tiny fangs sticking out of her mouth. I did not hear any ticking.

&#34;Daddy! Look what I got!&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s a little too much, Emily, don&#39;t you think? It&#39;ll give the dentist a locked gear. Hey, why don&#39;t you take some? I don&#39;t really have much of a sweet tooth.&#34;

Taken a little aback by that. Nobody offered me food, much less your own daughter&#39;s candy. Not //that// Nobody, that would be weird.

&#34;Thanks, I guess. And don&#39;t worry, I have plenty of teeth.&#34;

&#34;Sure, see you around.&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m sure we won&#39;t.&#34;

I made a mental note of who not to kill next time. Meanwhile, I&#39;m stuck with a lot of candy and no taste buds.

Do Archons like candy?</textarea></pre>
