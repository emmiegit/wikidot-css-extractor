[[size 120%]] **UIU File 2018-479:** &#34;Gentleman Thief&#34; ##red|Thank you! I like the nickname.##[[/size]]
[[/=]]
**Summary:** Subject(s) use --anomalous capabilities-- ##red|skill## to rob various banks and properties both across the United States and internationally.

The subject leads and works with the --criminal-- ##red|That&#39;s a bit rude, I&#39;d say. More, err, &#34;thievery&#34;## organization known as &#34;Caninae&#34; to authorities.

[[tab Suspect]]

**Name:** --unknown-- ##red|Janus, Ishikawa Goemon, Robin Hood, Schinderhannes, etc. I&#39;ve had many, to say the least.##, alias &#34;Canis Anthus&#34;

**Irregularity Cross-reference:** --Human--, --Espionage--, --Hostile-- ##red|:(##

**Physical Description:**

||~ Sex ||~ Height ||~ Weight/Build ||~ Race ||~ Hair ||~ Eyes ||~ Identifying Attributes ||
|| Male || --72-- ##red|74## in. || Unknown/Medium ||--Caucasian-- ##red|It depends on the day, really.## || Black || Blue || Anubian jackal mask. Navy blue suit and goldenrod shirt.||

**Capabilities:** Suspect has an --anomalous property-- ##red|Courtesy of your government. They wanted to use it for faking attacks to start proxy wars. PENTAGRAM. Such a devious, devilish name. It fits.## wherein they can produce explosions approximating two kilograms from their fingertips. These explosions, however, do not injure humans nor structural architecture; they appear to only affect safes.

**Purpose/Motive:** Unknown. Large sums of donated money matching the total value of stolen property occur one or two days after the theft: monetary gain does not seem to be main motive of the suspect. ##red|Oh, good! I was afraid you wouldn&#39;t notice. Sometimes you have to be very obtuse with things, I&#39;ve learned.##

**Modus Operandi:** Suspect will rob banks or mansions, usually during large gatherings or parties. They are nearly always assisted by the ##blue|highly talented, skilled, and the totally awesome!!## persons going by the name &#34;Canis Lupis&#34; and &#34;Canis Latrans&#34;. ##red|I apologize for Latrans&#39;s outburst.##

**Behavior:** Suspect - from witness interviews - is described as endearing and kind-natured. --It is unsure if this is a true evaluation of the suspect&#39;s character or a result of untreated Stockholm Syndrome.-- ##red|I don&#39;t like hurting people. After all, we only take from those who can shoulder the hit (and should&#39;ve already.)##

[[tab Evidence]]

**A │ Fingerprint Match:** Fingerprint analysis between found prints at various crime scenes match with 97% confidence. These fingerprints do not match with any known criminals in the FBI database.
##red|You won&#39;t find it, I assure you that.##


**B │ Surveillance Camera Footage:** The suspect has been captured on multiple surveillance footage from several crime scenes, wearing the same attire. ##red|Hey, I prefer to call it a &#34;style&#34;, yanno?## The build and appearance of the subject remains consistent throughout all footage. ##red|(No shit.)##

**C │ Foundation Incident SCP-████-A:** --The subject was involved in a containment breach involving SCP-████-A. The subject infiltrated Site-81 and interacted with [DATA REMOVED], assisting SCP-████-A in their escape of Site-81.--
##red|I never leave anybody behind, especially if they&#39;ve helped me out in the past. They&#39;re not a bad person.##

**D │ Anubis Mask:**
[[include component:image-block name=anubis-mask.gif|align=center|width=250px|caption= 360 degree view of the mask.]]
An Anubis mask worn by the suspect. Found shattered at the scene of a robbery by an explosive force. The fingerprints on the mask coincide with those found on the safe present at the crime scene.
##red|That was my favorite mask, too. Damn shame. I accidentally double-loaded the explosives on that safe. Glad to know nobody got hurt.##

[[/tab]]
[[tab Bureau Record]]

**Current Status:** --In process of apprehending-- ##red|Ain&#39;t happening.##

**Crimes:** Multiple counts of Aggravated Robbery, three counts of Armed Robbery

**Sentencing:** Indefinite Detainment

**History of UIU Action:**
__Late 2015:__ The UIU is alerted after several reports from Pennsylvanian authorities of a string of bank robberies where explosives were used in high effect: however, bystanders were never injured during these heists. ##red|As they shouldn&#39;t.##

__04-01-16:__ The suspect was involved in the Site-81 containment breach regarding SCP-████-A. The UIU was deferred full operational investigation of the suspect.

__06-23-17:__ Operational investigation was transferred back to the SCP Foundation after no progress was made on the case for over a year.

##red|Good work overall! Keep it up! - Canis Anthus##
