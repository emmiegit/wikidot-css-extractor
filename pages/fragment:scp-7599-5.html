+ **Description:**
[[/=]]

Reality 102 is the designation of one of the three realities attached to Epsilon-5. Reality 102 shares connections with four other realities: 103, 104, 106 and 112. A potential connection with 105 is also believed to exist, however this has not been proven nor refuted.

Due to a major CK Class restructuring event, thought to be connected to an anomalous source, Reality 102 has entered a state of partial collapse and has become an abyssal reality[[footnote]]Abyssal realities refer to realities which, due to K class events, have been irreversibly damaged. Such realities have had the borders around themselves melted away, thus allowing the void on the opposing side to seep in.[[/footnote]]. Only one trace of life has been detected inside of 102. (See Addenda.)

As Reality 102 is in a fractured state, the entry of an item or person into it will initiate a full on collapse. A possible way to open up a gateway into it is being worked on, but further investigations into the internal parts of the reality via entry into it has been restricted to protect the realities 102 is connected to.
‎ 
[[=]]
+ **Usage Under Project Probinum**
[[/=]]

Reality 102 was first accessed before the CK Class restructuring event, and was deemed appropriate to be catalogued and utilized for the project due to its similarity to baseline reality. IRCR specialists first accessed it on the 10th of April, 2019, and fully cut off access 6 days later, on the 16th.

Through intercepting the news, broadcasting and internet of the reality, the IRCR was able to detect and discover two separate anomalies:

* SCP-7599, which was discovered through a man by the name of Jack Midway Doyle. Mr. Doyle had appeared on the news on three separate occasions in the last 5 days, for winning the lottery twice in a row, for being the survivor of a fatal car crash and for an interview by the Wisconsin State Journal where his emotional &#39;rags to riches&#39; story was discussed and revealed to the public. After multiple failed attempts, the IRCR set up communications with him via a phone call on the 16th of April, after which SCP-7599 was quickly found. The full discovery and interview log is present on [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7599/offset/3|SCP-7599&#39;s file.]]]

* SCP-███, which was discovered after the IRCR investigated disappearances that had occurred in White Pine Hollow Forest, a state forest located in Iowa. Surveillance of the area showed SCP-███ dragging bodies from nearby areas into a &#39;den&#39; located in the middle of the forest. Agents quickly returned back to normal reality and alerted MTF Eta-10 (&#34;See No Evil&#34;)[[footnote]]Mobile Task Force that specializes in the investigation, acquisition, and initial containment of objects or entities exhibiting visual cognitohazards.[[/footnote]] to the presence of the SCP in the park. MTF units successfully secured and contained it in baseline reality on the 18th.

No other signs or indications of unknown anomalous objects were observed during the 6 days the IRCR had contact with Reality 102. Communications with the reality were not restored until Project Probinum was restarted, and 102&#39;s current status was discovered by the IRCR.
‎ 
[[=]]
+ **Addendum: Recovered Journal Entries**
[[/=]]

The following journal entries were recovered after an internal scan of the reality was conducted by the IRCR to declare if any technological devices (anomalous or not) were remaining and still being actively used. Only two were found, both of which were located in Wisconsin, a state in the USA.

Attempts to enter and download the files from outside of the reality via wavelength interception were conducted. While one of the devices could not be reached in any way (presumably due to the fact it was a cellular device), the other one could be partial accessed. The device, a MacBook Air, could only have files from its Notes and Preview app downloaded. Most of the notes were journal entries, written through the 18th of March, 2021 to the 21st of May of the same year. No other notes were written after that date.

While an exact name was not discovered anywhere in the journal entries, they are presumed to belong to Jack Doyle, due to mentions of SCP-7599, the interview the IRCR conducted with him on the 16th and events that fit the timeline the IRCR had plotted in the reality from the 10th to the 16th.

Some of the entries have been omitted for brevity.

Monopoly. Terrible game, but my son’s birthday is coming up, and all I remember from those christmases when I was still with Angelina was how excited my son would get playing whichever board game she had chosen from the closet. I don’t remember ever playing monopoly, though- I had to hope that Angelina hadn’t already bought him the game while I was gone.

Bought it from Toyz&#34;R&#34;Us. I haven&#39;t been there ever since I was a child, but I have to admit, there&#39;s a level of deep nostalgia one gets from going to places they haven&#39;t been to since their childhood. Everything was so vibrant, so colorful, and I almost considered buying myself a board game, a pack of cards, something like that.  But I decided against it. After all, I’m already sacrificing some of my treatment money to buy this gift. I certainly can’t sacrifice more.

It&#39;s a Las Vegas edition of the game. The edition doesn&#39;t actually affect much in the game: just those funny player pieces and some design stuff. The vendor told me it was a ‘special copy’, though. Something about a difference on the cover because it had been designed as a collector’s item.

Didn’t charge me extra for it, though, so I’m not really buying what he said.

Alex’s birthday&#39;s on the 21st. Only 3 days. I’m sure Angelina won’t let me stay for long (god knows if she even lets me inside) but I’ll just have to hope for the best. Buying a gift for him and being unable to even give it would be heart breaking. I’m sure he wants to see me again too.

I hope he does.

Tried to call Angelina today. She doesn’t normally pick up my calls, but I thought that she’d at least give me a chance 2 days before my own son’s birthday. No reply, though.

I tried a few more times later. I know she comes early from work on Fridays. Maybe she just has plans, or she’s purposefully ignoring me. I’m starting to think it&#39;s the latter.

Went to the doc today. I’m running out of money to give for the chemo prescriptions. Not like I&#39;m rich enough to afford health insurance either. Minimum wage isn’t cutting it for me anymore.

At least Dad’s doing better. I called him to see how he was doing. He’s finally stopped smoking, &#34;apparently&#34;, but considering he’s told me this three times in the last 3 months and not gone through with it, I’m starting to doubt whether he actually wants to or not.
[[/&lt;]]

+++++ Entry 3, 21/3/19
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
[[&lt;]]

Went to Angelina’s house with the gift. I never got her to pick up my calls, but I knew that she’d be home. She might be an asshole, but at least she cares about our son enough to spend time with him for his birthday.

Rang the doorbell a few times. I knew she was purposefully not answering, but after a minute or two of waiting, she finally opened the door. I tried to explain that I was here to give a gift, that I just wanted to see my son, but you know what she did?

She closed the fucking door on me. Left me standing like an idiot, carrying a monopoly set meant for my sin, right outside her house. I tried to ring the bell a few more times, but she just wouldn’t answer. 

I could hear her inside, talking to Alex. Said I was a random homeless man. Alex probably believed it- he hasn&#39;t seen me in a few years. I started breaking down on her doorstep, but it was of no use. Guess there&#39;s no going back.

Decided to call my friends. If she wasn’t going to let me see my own kid on his birthday, there was nothing else I could do without feeling like I was going to start breaking down again. Maybe they’d help me relieve my frustration.

Called Dave. He said they were planning to go to the pub to play some dice. I hate playing it (undoubtedly because I keep losing) but if it meant spending some time with people who actually care about me, I would do anything.

We met up a hour later. I’d lost the dice I normally used for playing it a week prior, but I did have a monopoly set left in my hands. I just nicked the dice, and decided I’d give the actual game to someone else whenever I could. Maybe Dave could give it to his own son.

Dice is a relatively simple game. Mostly luck, maybe a bit of smart probability, but you’re not guaranteed to win or anything. I’d never won it before, either because I was unlucky or I just had no idea how to calculate probability.

But I suppose I got lucky today. Won my first game. I went for a bit of a risky strategy, but it certainly payed off. And, let me say, there&#39;s really nothing quite as satisfying as beating your friends at a game. After being harassed about it for a few months, I finally had my first game in my pocket. Distracted me from the hellhole the rest of my day had been.

And hey, I did also get 5 bucks. Enough for a cup of coffee.

Seems like lady luck’s started taking a fancy to me recently.

Bought some scratch cards yesterday. I know they’re just gambling for idiots, but it’s not like I have much to lose.  They cost 2 dollars each, and even though the first three really didn’t make it seem like I was going to get anything, I did snag a 20 from the fourth. 

12 dollars. Not bad at all for something rigged for you to lose.

Dad’s condition is also getting better. It’s only been a week, so I might be speaking too soon, but he told me he hasn’t touched a cigarette since he started. Coughed a lot less on the phone, so I believe he&#39;s telling the truth. 

Treated myself to some coffee at a cafe that opened up nearby the apartment today. Small little corner place, with a vintage look and a nice atmosphere. Coffee&#39;s not as good as Maynard’s coffee back home (though I doubt anyone could ever beat that), but it certainly wasn’t bad either. Might go there again whenever I have some extra change.

It’s been a week since I last saw Angelina. I tried calling another two or three times, all left without responses. I guess maybe she’s cutting off ties with me permanently. At least she hasn&#39;t gotten a restraining order. Yet.

Went to the cafe today again. I didn’t really have much in mind- just wanted to enjoy some coffee on a Sunday morning. I wasn’t in a particularly amazing mood or anything. It was one of those rainy days; one where you just stare out of the window for hours at end with nothing to think about.

The monotone was broken when I met this wonderful woman, though. Her name’s Sierra, and she is beautiful. Brown, long hair, amber eyes, fashionable, everything you could ever want. Compared to my homeless-looking ass, she was certainly a lot better looking.

It was about 12, and I was just finishing off my coffee, ready to leave. She just sort of came to the table, asked if anyone else was coming and made herself comfortable on the opposite bench. And from there, well, she sparked a conversation with me.

She&#39;s apparently Canadian. Born in Toronto, raised there, and studied in the US before deciding to live here permanently. She was a traveller by heart. I never really left the US except when I visited my dad back in the UK, so it was interesting to hear about all the places she had been to. Brazil, New Zealand, Indonesia, Japan, Turkey.. she explained tales about all of them, while I just listened, sipping my coffee.

Of course, the conversation got a bit more private after a while. I had finished talking about Angelina, and she told me she had divorced her ex-husband just a few days before. She was going on a work trip to Greece (wonderful country, as she had explained in much detail while she talked about her journeys) but her flight had been postponed to the following day due to weather conditions. 

She went home, not telling her husband about it, and had caught him cheating on her. Some much younger, American girl, apparently. And, obviously, their relationship cut off there Started crying, and I tried to comfort her. Must’ve been rough on her, but I guess it was fortunate she caught on about the whole thing earlier. Unlike a certain //someone.//

We continued talking for another 2 hours, just sitting and talking. I told her about my whole lung problems- reassured her that it wasn’t lethal or anything- and we just exchanged stories, memories and information. She had to leave eventually, had to go meet a friend. 

But she did leave me her number.

Writing this at 1 in the morning. It’s been a bit of a busy night.

I went on my first proper date with Sierra. Called her in the morning, asked her if she had any plans, all of that classic stuff. She said she didn’t, and since I remembered that she had told me her favorite food was pizza, I proposed we go to a nearby Italian place. 

Food isn’t Michelin star level fantastic there, but the pizza and desserts are pretty good. And considering they’re pretty cheap, it’s well worth the money. I decided to be a bit risky and pay the whole bill- only about 10 dollars, and I had been getting luckier with scratch cards recently, so why not be a gentlemen?

We shared a Margarita together, had some soda and Sierra decided to go for a tiramisu. I think she liked it, so that’s always a relief.

Afterwards, we just sort of walked around town a bit. Talked some more about life, our goals, all that classic, cheesy stuff.  We watched the night sky a bit in silence, and Sierra even saw one of those shooting stars. She made a wish- kept it to herself, of course, but I have a feeling I know what it was.

We decided to finish the night off with a trip to our cafe, where they were having some live music. Some group called the Brickell Brothers. We just drank some coffee, enjoyed the jazz, and then parted ways near midnight.

I can&#39;t lie, it was the most fun I’ve had in years.

Something must have changed. Life’s looking up for me all of a sudden. 

I’ve just been getting luckier. Won my first 50 from a scratch card, and another 20 directly after. I’m not sure what the probability of that is, but I&#39;m certain it&#39;s rather low.

Dad’s treatment is finally going successfully. Combined with some lucky circumstances and the fact he’s stopped with the cigarettes, it seems like he might actually have a chance of being healthy again. It’s a slim chance, considering he’s rather old and inactive even for his age, but still one that I hope for.

My treatment’s fine too. Finally was able to start buying my meds again.  Not all of them- some of them have taken a pricy markup since I last bought them- but enough to keep me well, for now.

And well, the greatest thing that&#39;s happened is that I got a job. Or, well, a job offer. Counselor for a relatively big office. Maybe that psychology degree finally payed off. There&#39;s an interview on Friday, and if I pass that, there&#39;s an applied interview the following day. I&#39;ve gotten quite used to those, so it should be a breeze.

Let’s hope I can keep this up. I feel like something good is awaiting me.

I can’t sleep.

I’ve had the most surreal two days in my life. Filled with some of my biggest emotional highs- and a few rather starting lows. I feel like I&#39;m dreaming, to be honest.

There’s good news and there’s bad news. Well… both of them are technically good, but one, not as much.

I’ll start with the great news. I won the lottery. I didn’t win the jackpot (god knows how rare that is), just the 50 thousand, but that’s still a //lot//, considering it&#39;s the Powerball. Enough to last me a few years, if I’m wise with it, and certainly enough to finally finish my treatment.

I cashed it in at their offices. Did all the stuff the website told me: sign the back, keep it safe, don’t tell anyone until you’ve cashed it in, all of that. And they delivered it. 50 thousand, right into my bank account, no other questions asked.

First person I told was obviously Sierra. I trusted her enough to not go telling everyone. And then I told Dave, Eric, all my other close friends who I trusted enough to keep my secret. And then me and Sierra got a tiny bit carried away. Maybe that wasn’t a great idea, considering everyone who knows me seems to be calling me to congratulate me now.

Dad seemed real excited about it too when I called him. Said that I was getting what I’ve deserved, and the classic moral about how hard workers get rewarded by god eventually. I told him I’d see if I could get a plane ticket to come visit him. Couldn’t put my bank account in jeopardy anymore, and I’ve missed him a lot. Haven&#39;t seen him since university started.

Second news is… well, I survived a car crash. It was the day before I won, and I was in a taxi to go to meet Sierra. When we were a minute or two away, some grey SUV crashed directly into the side of the vehicle, and another van collided into the SUV.

I was able to get out quickly, mostly unscathed, but the others weren’t so lucky. Taxi driver broke his arm, and the couple in the SUV got lightly wounded. I didn’t see the van driver again, and the whole thing was big enough to attract the vultures that are news reporters, so I&#39;m guessing something might&#39;ve happened to him.

One of the news reporters interviewed me for a minute or two, so I got a little bit of prime time. Sierra said she saw it on the TV, and so did some other people. Everyone said I was lucky to get on the news like that.

But honestly, I&#39;m more glad to be uninjured.

Stuff’s just getting weirder and weirder.

I won the lottery. Again. Another 50k, in a row. I don’t know what the probability of that is, but it’s certainly nearing an extremely low barrier.  In fact, they had to audit me at the offices for almost a hour just to make sure the victory wasn’t fraudulent. I’m pretty sure they’re still suspicious of me.

I decided that I certainly had enough money to go visit dad now. Maybe I could buy Sierra a ticket too, if she wanted to go to the UK again. Not the most happy or interesting place ever, but it&#39;s still a unique country.

I went on the news a few times in the last three days. Mostly the State Journal, but they also had me on an interview for a podcast dedicated to news from Madison. Apparently going from being unable to pay your bills and slowly dying to a somewhat mediocre financial position is something people find interesting, especially when it involves random chance. Maybe some people just hope to get lucky too. Maybe it&#39;s &#34;inspired&#34; them.

Oh, and yeah, I got the job. Interview was a breeze, applied interview was even easier and I passed through all of it quicker than any other candidate. I got hired, and work started just this Monday. The job&#39;s nice, and thankfully a lot more financially stable than working at a restaurant.

Strangest thing that happened to me though is a phone call I got today. It was early in the morning, and I was going to leave for work, and my phone just started ringing. Someone was calling my private phone number. The one nobody uses except dad, Sierra, maybe some close friends.

I thought it was some wrong number situation at first, so I let it slide, but they just kept calling, so I picked up. And I have absolutely no clue who the fuck this person was, but I’m convinced they&#39;re some kind of psychopathic stalker.

They said they were someone called Dr. Braum, some ‘inter-reality communications specialist’ (god knows what that&#39;s meant to be) and they somehow had my name, my story, everything. Most of it was stuff that&#39;s already on the news, but they had just a tad bit too much of my private information too.

I tried to hang up, scared out of my mind, but they just relentlessly called me. I decided cooperation might just be a good idea. They started asking all these personal questions, stuff about my lucky dice, the monopoly set I had bought, my son&#39;s birthday, all that weird stuff.

I kept asking and wondering when they were going to explain everything, but once I was done explaining the set to them, they just hang up. Never gave me any details. I tried to call again, yet no reply.

Either this is some elaborate joke, or I should be going to the police right about now.

I’m staring to get seriously concerned. And I don’t say that lightly like last time, I mean it. I’m being messed with.

Got into another accident. This one was even worse. I was riding the bus to work, when a white car just swerved right into us in a roundabout. Worst part is that a whole pile up just happened on the road, and it took a decent while before the road could be secured and shut off.

The consequences are worse too. One of the guys had his entire windshield shatter into his face, and he had some extreme bleeding. Most of the people in the bus, including me, were fine, at the very least. The others? I’m not so sure.

Also, just found a random package at the door. I’m sure it wasn’t meant for me, but there was no address on it. I opened it up, and there was some new headphones inside. They looked like they costed a fortune, and I’m really not sure what to do with them. Just accept the lucky ‘gift’?

Normally, I’d just ignore these situations and not worry about them. But considering how many of these have started happening recently, I’m starting to think that someone’s messing with me. Or worse.

I haven’t gotten called again by the stalkers. I hope I never see their number again.

Dad was doing so well. Was finally recovering, hadn&#39;t smoked in nearly a month (his all time record) and things were finally looking up for him.

I got the news he died on Monday. A phone call from the hospital, telling me he had suffered a heart attack. Maybe related to his sickness, maybe just random. Could’ve been either one of them.

I couldn’t go see him in his last moments. Not enough time to fly and see him. He was gone in a few hours. He had gone peacefully enough, at least.

Funeral was yesterday. Had to book a flight all the way to the UK, and Sierra decided to come with me. Said that I needed someone to support me. I tried to get her to stay, but she wouldn’t budge.

The funeral was a classic one. My dad was a Christian, so we had it at the church, at the same one my mom’s funeral had been held in. There weren’t many people- just family, friends, the people I knew he really cared about.

I’m sure dad would have liked the funeral. He left all his inheritance to me- not a lot, but everything the poor man had left. Enough to finish treatment.

He always said he was proud of me.

Yet sitting at a bar the following day, scratch cards in one hand and a beer in the other, all I feel like is a bag of shit.

It&#39;s late again. But I don&#39;t want to sleep. I can&#39;t sleep.

I returned home yesterday. I didn&#39;t want to leave, but I had to return home. For work, for Sierra&#39;s job, for my friends. Returned via plane, and I still had the day off, so I just spent it with Sierra. She&#39;s the only one keeping me sane, at this point, yet even that effect&#39;s starting to wear off.

I decided to take her on a date. Not a proper one, just one of those classic dinner dates we used to have. And there was no better place than the Italian nearby. Maybe a shared Margarita, or something different, with a soda and a tiramisu on the side. That was what I was planning. That&#39;s all I wanted.

Until I got hit by a fucking car. 

Was crossing the road, when out of nowhere, a speeding car pulled out from the side. Sierra was close, but I got absolutely demolished from the back. Car didn&#39;t stop, kept going, completely ignoring what they just did. I just fell to the ground. I thought it was over.

Doc said most of my spine should&#39;ve been damaged. But I&#39;m fine. I fell perfectly, one of those &#34;lucky&#34; coincidences. Apparently I just have to do some small stuff to help with the bruising. But apart from that? Perfectly, utterly, completely //alright.//

This has to be abnormal, right? Something must be going on here. Something has to be going on here. I&#39;m convinced it&#39;s because of those people. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ve done something to me. They&#39;re messing with me.

The last straw was today. Bought two last lottery tickets. Just two more, to reassure myself that I wasn&#39;t going crazy. Two harmless little things. Harmless.

A million.

The jackpot.

I&#39;m sure.

5 days.

I haven&#39;t cashed in the ticket yet. I don&#39;t think I should. If someone&#39;s playing with you, the best thing to do is just defy their game. Resist it. You can&#39;t follow the path they lay for you. You need to counter it, you need to keep fighting.

I went to the mall. Anywhere I go now, I&#39;m afraid that something is going to happen. I can&#39;t keep my mind from overthinking. What if there&#39;s an accident? A robbery? But no, one can never really be ready, can they?

There was a shooting. Everything got locked off, in a matter of seconds. Police got called immediately, but it was too late. I watched them search every hiding spot, find people, and deliver that little shot of the angel of death right into their skulls. Yet, even though my heart was pounding and every part of me was soaked in the smell of sweat, they passed me.

Robbers all got shot by police, apparently.

I left the mall. Another accident. An entire pile-up of cars, crashed and smashed into each other, the road resembling a scrapyard more than anything. I stood, in the middle, watching as one of the cars&#39; motors ignited into flames. A dance of orange and yellow tendrils of fire, playing together.

54 injured. 8 dead. One day.

I don&#39;t think I can handle this anymore. Everything is wrong.

Sierra started isolating herself from me. Maybe she thought I was going crazy. I probably am. The straw that broke the camel&#39;s back was when she saw all of the lottery tickets. I stashed dozens of them inside of my shelf, almost all of them winning ones.

She said she&#39;d go to the police. That I was cheating, that I was some kind of criminal, that she couldn&#39;t handle me anymore. I tried to convince her, attempted to tell her that this was some kind of god messing with me, but she wouldn&#39;t listen. Said I was a lunatic.

She&#39;s gone now. She only told one person about the tickets and me, and they are too. Died on the way to the police station. Car accident. Sierra broke her entire ribcage, bleeding out, and I never really heard what happened to our friend. Maybe something similar.

All of my friends started leaving too. Now, they&#39;re dropping like flies. Dave died from food poisoning, James from a house fire, Tino from a mugging. Maybe they got what they deserved. Maybe they didn&#39;t.

All I know is that I&#39;m alone.

I can&#39;t feel myself anymore. There&#39;s a sense of paralysis, a complete loss of everything that has housed itself into me. 

There&#39;s people dying outside. Maybe I shouldn&#39;t be surprised. My idea was nothing but stupidity.

When you resist a god&#39;s game, you&#39;ve already lost. Because once you defy them, they hold enough power over you to enact the consequences of such an action. They&#39;ve trapped you in their limitless grasp, and they&#39;ve hung you by the neck, weak and sheepish.

Yet, no matter how dire the situation, I sense an impending escape.

I suppose the end has come.

I looked up at the sky. A red dot lays suspended in the air, and even though it seems static, I can see it&#39;s growing. I can feel it. Consuming the world around us, buying its time as it slowly expands across the horizon, feeding off of the sky itself.

Everyone is panicked. Everyone that&#39;s left. There&#39;s been hysteria for a week anyways. Our world has left us with nothing but pure anarchy.

I still have the dice. I haven&#39;t let go of them ever since I first touched them. I just prayed that I would finally escape this hellhole. Everything has been ruined.

I took a final image. Just in case everything isn&#39;t destroyed. I still want to be remembered.

I no longer feel sad. Some indescribable emotion has filled me. Something between melancholy and excitement, filling every part of me in these last moments.

I&#39;ll finish writing this, and then I&#39;ll watch the sky. I&#39;ll watch that abyss in the sky grow larger and larger. And I&#39;ll be the only one to ever know why.

This is how it ends.

I&#39;ve beaten Braum&#39;s game. I&#39;ve beaten them.

//Finally.//
