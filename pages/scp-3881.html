**Item #:** SCP-3881

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3881 is to be kept within a standard containment locker. No further containment procedures are necessary.

**Description:** SCP-3881 is a classic gold band style wedding ring with a few cosmetic alterations. When worn by a human being, SCP-3881 will immediately transport the wearer to an unknown location. Upon removal, the ring and the wearer will be returned to their previous position.

The location is a clearing in a forest containing a single thatched-roof house. The house is fully furnished, well maintained and shows signs of prior use. Clothing within the house presumably belonged to an adult male, shoe-size 10, with approximately five years of disuse.

SCP-3881 was discovered within a pawn shop, being pawned by a Miss Pamela Smith.

&gt; ████**:** Excellent, thank you. Would you mind answering a few questions about a ring you received?
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; **Smith:** I&#39;d... rather not, if that&#39;s OK. It&#39;s not a topic I like to discuss.

&gt; **Smith:** Investigation? Howard&#39;s legally dead, what reason could you //possibly// have for an investigation?

&gt; ████**:** Miss Smith, I think we may be on the wrong page. Did you ever wear the ring?
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; **Smith:** What kind of a question is that? Of course I didn&#39;t. I couldn&#39;t even look at the thing.

&gt; **Smith:** I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s just... too much, you know? I miss him. I know it&#39;s stupid and emotional to get attached to a ring.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; ████**:** That&#39;s not true at all. We&#39;re all human. Is that why you pawned the ring?
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; **Smith:** I just... always knew that it was in the house. It nagged at me. I couldn&#39;t move on while it was around, like he was waiting for me. Does that make any sense? It doesn&#39;t help that he sent me that sappy letter, either.

**Addendum B:** A transcription of the letter given to The Foundation by Pamela Smith.

&gt; Dear Pam,
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; I&#39;m writing this to you because I failed. I&#39;m on the run. I can&#39;t go into detail, but I needed to give this to you.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; I&#39;m also writing this because you&#39;ve been incredible. I&#39;ve had so much fun falling in love with you. I remember our first date, out on the hill where we got lost in each other&#39;s eyes. I remember the long walks where we would worry about what colour plates to buy. I remember the petty fights where we got mad about where to put the furniture, or what we would call our kids. I wouldn&#39;t trade these things for anything else in the whole world.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; I&#39;ve worked hard for the ring within this envelope. Please, wear it. That way, we&#39;ll be together no matter how far apart we are.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; Will you marry a dead man?

&gt; With love,
