**Special Containment Procedures:** Investigations into SCP-6370 are ongoing. The mechanism through which entry to SCP-6370 is gained is currently unknown, hindering research. Footage from Researcher Brandes&#39; surveillance is currently under analysis. Stills of individuals encountered by Brandes are in the process of being compared to missing persons records.

**Description:** SCP-6370 is an extradimensional spatial anomaly. The interior dimensions of the anomaly are as yet unknown, but are seemingly limitless. The interior is characterised by an arid, desert environment, through which runs a highway road. Based on recovered footage, there are a number of structures and inhabitants within SCP-6370. At least one inhabitant is currently believed to be native to the space. It is hypothesised that SCP-6370 has anomalous spatial and temporal properties, and that those within it experience impairment of their cognitive abilities as a potential result of this.

**Discovery:** On the morning of 08/13/2021, Foundation Researcher Jeffrey Brandes departed Site-19 after a night shift. Upon finishing their shift, Brandes neglected to turn off and remove from his attire the mandatory recording equipment[[footnote]] Microcamera and microphone. [[/footnote]] worn during conducted testing. At some point on the journey to his civilian residence, Brandes entered SCP-6370: 

[[div class=&#34;interview&#34;]]

= **[BEGIN FOOTAGE]**

//[Brandes leaves his personal laboratory, gathers his belongings, and walks to the nearest Site checkout gate. He engages in conversation with the guard on duty, Franklin Perez:]//

**Brandes:** Have a good weekend, Frank. 

**Perez:** Thanks Jeff, you too. Are you and Lisa up to anything?

**Brandes:** I don&#39;t think so, we&#39;ll just have a quiet one. See you Monday.

//[Brandes walks to vehicle bay WEST-3A and enters his civilian vehicle. He exits the site.]//

//[The recording equipment, situated on Brandes&#39; coat, captures the journey from his vantage point.]//

//[The surrounding environment begins to exhibit minor deviations from baseline. Treelines grow sparser, the ground dryer.]//

//[21 minutes into the journey, the footage undergoes a sudden degradation in quality. The sound of static is briefly heard. Brandes enters SCP-6370.]//

//[A structure comes into view on the horizon. As Brandes drives closer, the building becomes identifiable as a diner. He mumbles to himself:]//

**Brandes:** Starving.

//[He signals to pull over, and drives into the diner&#39;s parking lot.]//

//[As he does so, the camera captures a seemingly humanoid entity, covered in a dark red liquid, crouched near the far side of the building. It faces away from the camera, and is non-identifiable.[[footnote]] Analysis hindered by video footage and lack of screen time and focus. [[/footnote]] Brandes does not appear to see the entity; if he does, he does not react.]//

//[The car stops and Brandes steps out, forgoing locking the vehicle. He surveys the landscape; no distinguishing features can be seen. Sand, hills and the highway stretch out before him. He takes his cellular phone out his pocket, and attempts to make a series of phone calls, none of which connect. Abandoning his efforts, he begins to walk around to the front of the building.]//

//[An unidentified elderly man comes into the camera&#39;s frame, walking down the highway in the opposite direction to Brandes. His dishevelled grey suit jacket flaps in the wind, whilst his feet are bare and bleeding. Brandes runs over to him.]//

**Brandes:** Hey! Hey you! 

//[With his back to the diner, Brandes places a hand on the man&#39;s shoulder. He stops and turns towards Brandes, but does not make eye contact.]//

**Brandes:** I&#39;m... I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m meant to be here. I need to get back to... //[he pauses.]// wherever I came from. Do you know the way? 

**UNIDENTIFIED:** //[Indiscernible.]//

**Brandes:** Can you speak up? I can&#39;t-

**UNIDENTIFIED:** Keep moving. You gotta keep moving. 

//[The man continues to mumble the phrase as Brandes responds.]//

**Brandes:** I, yes that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do. Do you know where we are? 

//[The man does not respond.]//

**Brandes:** Do you know where we are?

//[The man looks up, still avoiding eye contact. He begins to stare over Brandes&#39; shoulder, his eyes widen and his breath quickens.]//

**UNIDENTIFIED:** The Oh...Oh...Oh![[footnote]] Accuracy of transcription unknown.[[/footnote]]

//[The man turns, and begins to run down the highway, leaving bloody footprints in his wake. Brandes watches silently before turning back to the diner.]//

//[A bell rings as Brandes opens the diner door. It appears to be empty.]//

**Brandes:** Hello?

//[A female voice calls out from back:]//

**UNIDENTIFIED-II:** One minute!

[[include component:image-block name=diner.jpg|align=right|width=50%|caption=Interior of SCP-6370.]]

//[The diner is in an unkempt state; the red leather seat covers are frayed and torn, and wood paneling pulls away from the walls. In the centre of the room, a counter in a U-shape divides the space between the seating and an area for drinks preparation. Food display units are situated on top of the counter. They are turned on, but empty. A large amount of mould grows in the back of one.]//  

**UNIDENTIFIED-II:** Take a seat, I&#39;ll be with you shortly!

//[Brandes situates himself in a seating booth, facing inwards to the diner, away from the highway. At the end of the row of booths, another patron is now visible. A large, bald man sits in the far corner, facing away from Brandes.]//

//[The source of the unidentified voice becomes apparent -- a server enters the room via a door next to the booth the patron is sat in. She carries a tray of food, coming from the kitchen. As the door closes, flies follow her into the room.]//

//[Brandes pulls out his phone and, on seeing the lack of signal, begins to toggle airplane mode on and off. The server leans over the counter to grab a menu.]//

**Server [previously UNIDENTIFIED-II]:** Welcome! It&#39;s nice to meet you, how&#39;s your day going?

**Brandes:** Okay, thanks. 

**Server:** Well here&#39;s our menu, can I get you-

//[Brandes looks up from his phone, making eye contact with the server. She pauses and stares at him. Pinned to her uniform is a nametag, degraded to the point of illegibility.]//

**Brandes:** I&#39;m sorry, are you okay?

//[A loud snorting sound is heard.]//

**Server:** I- yes, I&#39;m fine.

**Brandes:** Do we know each other?

**Server:** No. No, I don&#39;t think we do.

//[Another loud snorting sound. Brandes turns from the server, looking down the row of booths. At the end, the patron is shovelling food into his mouth with his hands at pace. The speed of consumption impinges his breathing, resulting in him respiring heavily through his nose.]//

//[The server steps back from the table.]//

**Server:** C-can I get you some coffee to start?

**Brandes:** That would be lovely, thank you.

//[A crunch reverberates throughout the diner. Brandes turns to look at the patron, who throws a glance over their shoulder; their eyes are covered by black sunglasses. They quickly resume consumption.]// 

**Server:** What, err, what brings you out here anyway? 

//[The sound of chewing begins to be heard constantly, but quietly.]//

**Brandes:** I&#39;m just trying to get home.

**Server:** Aren&#39;t we all? 

//[The sound of chewing grows in volume.]//

//[The server returns to Brandes&#39; booth. Her face is flushed and moist.]//

**Server:** Have you had a chance to look at the menu?

**Brandes:** Yeah, I was thinking the waffles with-

**Server:** I&#39;m sorry, we don&#39;t have the waffles at the moment.

//[Leaning over the table, the server&#39;s hand shakes as she pours the coffee. A drop of sweat falls from her forehead and lands in the cup. The chewing sounds grow increasingly louder.]//

**Brandes:** Okay, how about the eggs over easy?

**Server:** Sorry, out of that too.

//[Brandes raises their voice to be heard over the chewing noises.]//

**Brandes:** Pancakes? 

**Server:** Nope.

**Brandes:** What do you have then?

**Server:** [indiscernible.] 

//[The server&#39;s lips move, but the  sound of chewing has grown to a volume where the words spoken cannot be discerned. She pauses for a minute, then continues. Due to the camera angle, it is unclear if Brandes is speaking too.]//

//[The volume of the chewing noises has increased to the point of distortion. Blood begins to seep from the server&#39;s ears. She mutters a single syllable at Brandes.]//

//[Brandes jumps from the booth and sprints out of the diner. As soon as the door closes behind him, the chewing noises cease. All that can then be heard is Brandes&#39; laboured breathing.]//

//[His car is absent from the parking lot.]//

//[He begins to walk along the highway, but turns to look at the diner before leaving. The server stares at him through the window, a tear rolling down her cheek. Brandes turns back to the highway and continues walking.]//

//[Brandes continues to walk down the highway. There have been no distinguishing landmarks or features so far. A young man appears on the horizon, walking towards Brandes. Brandes runs to him.]//

**Brandes:** Hey! Hey you! 

**UNIDENTIFIED:** Whoa, whoa, stay back! Stay the fuck back.

//[As Brandes approaches, the man darts backwards, off the road. His dress shoes throw up sand against his grey suit, soiling it.]//

**Brandes:** I just wanted to know where we are! I&#39;m trying to get home.

//[The man stops moving and stands in place. Silence.]//

**UNIDENTIFIED:** Have we met before?

**Brandes:** No? I, I don&#39;t think so?

**UNIDENTIFIED:** …okay. Guessing you must be new here then.

//[The man resumes walking.]//

**UNIDENTIFIED:** I&#39;m sorry, but you can have this advice for free. Try and fight through the fog, but above all, keep moving. You hear me? You gotta keep moving.

**Brandes:** Why? 

//[With the distance between them growing, the man raises his voice to be heard.]//

**UNIDENTIFIED:** The Ogre. Don&#39;t let the Ogre catch you.

//[The interior resembles a supermarket, but the shelves are empty. On some, empty containers and packets are scattered.]//

//[Brandes wanders through the supermarket aisles. The shelves are high, restricting the dim shine of the lights above.]//

**Brandes:** Hello?

**UNIDENTIFIED-III:** Good Morning, Sir. Can I help you today? Regretfully we&#39;re out of stock of most items at the moment.

**Brandes:** That&#39;s okay. I&#39;m just looking for a way out of here.

**UNIDENTIFIED-III:** The way out? It&#39;s just along the aisles, the same way you came in.

**Brandes:** No, not out of here, out of, agh- //[Brandes clutches his forehead]// out of //HERE//, out of this place. I need to get home. 

**UNIDENTFIED-III:** Oh. Oh I&#39;m so sorry.

**UNIDENTIFIED-III:** There&#39;s no going home.

//[A brief jingle plays over the building&#39;s tannoy system. This is followed by the commencement of chewing noises.]//  

**UNIDENTIFIED-III:** The store&#39;s closing, Sir. I must ask you leave. 

//[The woman glances over Brandes&#39; shoulder. The lights flicker.]//

**Brandes:** What do you mean by that?

**UNIDENTIFIED-III:** Sir, please-

//[A shuffling noise is heard behind Brandes.]//

**Brandes:** Why can&#39;t I go home? 

//[A figure shuffles into frame and walks behind the desk. They situate themselves directly behind the woman. It is the patron from the diner.]//

**Brandes:** Hey, sorry but we&#39;re having a conver-

**UNIDENTIFIED-III:** Be quiet. 

//[Up close, the features of the patron are more discernible. Its skin is grey and mottled, and what earlier appeared to be a nose is in fact crude makeup drawn on a flat surface. Despite this, it leans in towards the woman, and proceeds to emit a series of sounds similar to sniffing. The woman stares directly forward.]//

//[The patron opens its mouth; a long, grey tongue falls out. It lands on the woman&#39;s shoulder, and licks all the way up to her ear before it retracts back into its mouth.]//

//[With a grunting noise, the patron opens its mouth and bites down with force on the woman&#39;s upper trapezius muscle. Once its teeth are embedded, it does not release its bite.]//

**UNIDENTIFIED-III:** Run.

//[The patron jerks its head upwards, pulling back layers of muscle and tendon. Blood sprays from ruptured vessels, covering Brandes in a red mist.]//

**UNIDENTIFIED-III:** RUN.

//[Brandes turns and begins to sprint, but slips in the blood. He hits the floor as blood continues to splatter over him. The lights begin to flicker rapidly.]//

//[Running his hands down his torso, Brandes notices the surveillance camera. He angles it to point towards his face.]// 

**Brandes:** If this is transmitting...

//[He appears pained when trying to speak.]//

**Brandes:** Found myself in...here. Time, distance, both seem wrong. //Wrong//. Cognition is dulled. Hazy. Can&#39;t remember where I&#39;ve been or going. Tell Lisa... time, distance, both seem wrong. //Wrong.// I&#39;ve found myself in this space, unsure-

//[The door Brandes is slumped by flies open, and a figure emerges.]//

**Brandes:** No! No, no ,no!

//[The patron lurches forward, and grabs Brandes by his coat lapels. As it does, its black sunglasses fall off its face. Behind them, two small, birdlike eyes are nestled within rolls of flesh. The surface of the eyes is completely black.]//

//[Brandes grasps onto the doorframe as the patron pulls him into the building. His grasp falters, and he is dragged through, falling through fly-filled air onto a tiled floor.]//

//[The patron leans in over Brandes, and begins to emit sniffing noises. Viscous pus drips from the skin folds of its neck, landing on Brandes&#39; chest.]//

//[Brandes raises his hands, attempting to push the patron away.]//

//[The patron opens its mouth. Its teeth are square, appearing too large for the mouth in which they reside. Its grey, ulcered tongue rests between the bottom set.]//

//[Brandes screams as the patron bites down on his left hand. Half his ring finger and the entirety of his middle and index finger are avulsed. The patron begins to chew.]//

//[It turns around and emits a low, guttural squealing sound, spraying half-chewed flesh as it does. A woman walks into frame -- the server.]//

**Brandes:** Help...help me...

//[The server moves to approach Brandes but is met by another vocalisation from the patron. It turns to her and gnashes its teeth, lurching its head in her direction.]//

**Server:** Okay, okay! 

//[Brandes moans as the server backs away. He rolls on the ground.]//

//[A dragging sound is heard. Brandes steadies his movement, and props himself up on his right elbow. His left hand bleeds continually. From this vantage point, cupboards, a stove, and worktop counters can be seen. The server pulls a meat grinder along the latter, towards Brandes and the patron.]//

//[Brandes attempts to move. The patron jumps on top of him, pinning him in place. The view from the camera is obscured. Screaming can be heard.]//

//[Two minutes later, the patron draws back, pulling away from Brandes&#39; face. Large scraps of skin and flesh hang out a blood soaked mouth. Brandes does not move. The server stands by the grinder, quietly crying.]// 

//[The patron rests its left hand on Brandes&#39; stomach, and begins to repeatedly pull his right leg. Tearing sounds are heard, followed by a popping as the femur dislocates from the hip bone.]//

//[Opening its mouth and unfurling its tongue, the patron holds aloft the severed leg. The tongue descends into the centre of the femur bone and undulates, dislodging the bone marrow within. The offal is lifted into the patron&#39;s mouth. The tongue descends into the bone again. As it does, an ulcer pops, spraying a yellow liquid outwards.]//

//[Empty of marrow, the leg is discarded. The patron&#39;s tongue licks its face, gathering the blood and smearing the drawn on nose.]//

//[The patron turns, and walks out of shot. A door is heard opening then closing.]//

//[Now holding a kitchen knife, the server walks up to the leg, picks it up, and carries it to the meat grinder. She begins to slice chunks of flesh into the machine&#39;s inlet.]//

//[A bell is heard. The server drops the remnants of the leg on the floor.]//

**UNKNOWN-IV:** Hello?

//[As a voice calls out from offscreen, the server turns the grinder&#39;s crank.]//

**Server:** One minute!

//[As the crank turns, the meat is ground to mince, falling unceremoniously onto a waiting plate.]// 

**Server:** Take a seat, I&#39;ll be with you shortly!

//[The server wipes her eyes, before inhaling deeply. She picks up the plate and walks offscreen.]//

//[A door is heard opening then closing.]//

**Server:** Welcome! It&#39;s nice to meet you, how&#39;s your day going?
