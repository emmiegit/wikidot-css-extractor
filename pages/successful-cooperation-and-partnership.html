&#34;Good day, this is &#34;Successful Cooperation and Partnership&#34; training center, we would like to...&#34;

That was where I hung up.

I know that&#39;s impolite. It&#39;s their job, yada yada - hell, a couple of months ago I&#39;d gladly have heard the girl out and declined their services politely. But now...

Guess that&#39;s persecution complex at its finest. My colleagues keep telling me to go to a health resort for a couple of days, but I&#39;ll be damned if it&#39;s not called &#34;Serenity. Calmness. Peace.&#34; And that gets us back to the point.

This is the third call today. Not that I&#39;m very busy, but Sunday is my only day free of work and I just want to get some peace while eating premade products in front of my TV, not entertaining all kinds of jerks.

Anyway, there&#39;s something fishy about it all.

First &#34;Sam&#39;s Chili and Pepperoni&#34;. Flooding my mailbox with their leaflets was not enough, so today they decided to give me a call. Guys, your sign board is as tasteless as your food, and it&#39;s right in front of my window! Stop pestering me.

And their food sucks. I paid them a visit once, swore like a sailor in the end. And they&#39;re to blame. Next day, they are expanding, and setting their new shop right across the road from my office. These guys don&#39;t seem to be affected by curses.

That&#39;s half the trouble anyway. Might as well not take the call from &#34;Shooters, Cartridges &amp; Partridges&#34; into account, they&#39;re calling for a second time. Their first call was about a week ago, when it all began.

What did begin? Didn&#39;t you notice already?

SCP. SCP. SCP.

Can&#39;t these guys think of anything smarter, or more inventive? Or is it a &#34;drive the sucker crazy&#34; marathon? Or... I don&#39;t even want to think about what else it can be. 

Of course I did my research. All of these are perfectly valid legal entities, doing fine, doing cold calls. It&#39;s just that they didn&#39;t phone the same guy at the same time until now.

It even sounds absurd. &#34;Hey, listen, I keep getting calls. And the abbreviation&#39;s the same, you know, the first letters... What? Why did I write them down? Well, uh...&#34; And off to the madhouse I go. Wouldn&#39;t even be surprised if its name were &#34;Sanctuary for Crushed Psyches&#34;. Eww.

Maybe I&#39;m really unraveling. Time to go for a walk.

It was no better outside, still. So I went to a shop. A nice shop, with a funny, colorful sign... at least, it was. They were dismantling it just as I arrived. Only &#34;Grocery&#34; remained from what was &#34;Grocery open constantly&#34;. Seems like things are turning ugly for the guys. A shame. It was a nice place, with decent prices. Now the prices are sure to rise.

All in all, utter disappointment. Barely escaped being done in by a truck on my way back. Took a second look - &#34;Sushi, Crab &amp; Perch&#34;. Friggin&#39; delivery service. Must be my swanky neighbor ordering the stuff.

&#34;Perch&#34;! Who the hell uses freshwater fish to make sushi...

That&#39;s it, screw everything. I&#39;m taking some days off, I&#39;m going to the resort no matter how it&#39;s named. Otherwise I&#39;m dangerously close to the aforemented madhouse. But hey, at least they will stop pestering me there, right?
