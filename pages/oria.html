The universe can be an empty place.

For millions of years, I&#39;ve been drifting in space as nothing but an assortment of nebulae enlightening the void. I&#39;ve come to realize this place as home as life goes on. 

My time here has felt so short, and yet, it feels like it lasts forever. Every so often, I feel fragments of myself drifting away as the frigid, solar winds push me into the darkness. I shouldn&#39;t worry, my consciousness will live on, but this form won&#39;t.

However, I&#39;ve experienced many things in this form. I&#39;ve seen unusual objects that others haven&#39;t: a collective of small raptors, a floating lobster, and even a bull god. They&#39;re unable to communicate correctly, but they managed to give me a word that defined who I am.

Oria.

It&#39;s an interesting name. My collective consciousness says it means &#34;the keeper of light&#34; and it means that in a literal sense.

My father had a similar name, his being Orion. From one of his stars, he gave birth to me as his successor. He told me he once was a hunter and was placed here. After my mother&#39;s physical form decayed, he predicted that she would be here, although it seems like that isn&#39;t the case. 

I&#39;m very unsure about my father&#39;s whereabouts and I have little hope that my mother is out there. I&#39;m assuming the last pieces of him are drifting about since he hasn&#39;t come back. All that&#39;s left in his place is me and the stars as I think silently.

My father once said to me that time is relative. Everything experiences time, but the effects differ with every sentient being. Time is an eternity to me. I&#39;ll live as long as the universe and see it fade away, but I hope to experience something new in the future.

Till then, I sit in the darkness, waiting and hoping for my parents to return.

…//ping//...

I hear something from the darkness: a soft beating. It sounds like a newborn star, which isn&#39;t new. So, I sit and wait again.

The sound echoes again, but it doesn&#39;t sound the same. There&#39;s a //uniqueness// to it.

It comes back once more, but I feel it throughout my body like a pulse. I&#39;m curious.

…//ping//, //ping//, //ping//...

It pulsates a strong force like it&#39;s pulling me. It&#39;s not a star, so, could it be my father? I follow the beating as I drift across the tenebrous expanse. 

…//ping//, //ping//, //ping//, **//ping//**, **//ping//**...

It gradually becomes louder and louder as I soar past gas giants and traveling comets.

I can feel myself slipping away as my speed increases. I become more worried as I fear I won&#39;t reach them, but then...

It stops.

I come to a sudden halt as I examine my surroundings. I take some time to recompose and relax before I realize where I am.

Eight planets, a dwarf planet, an asteroid belt, and a sun. 

I remember father telling stories about these things. My hopes ran higher as I moved around and watched the planets rotate. //He could be here,// I thought to myself. I listen closely.

…**//PING//**.

I stare down as I find out where it came from. A fascinating location for it to originate.

He called this planet &#34;Earth&#34;, the place where his old body withered away.

My hopes to find my parents got sucked away. //A trick,// I thought, //I&#39;m such an idiot//. Then, I had an idea: if he couldn&#39;t find my mother, then something from this planet can help me find both of them. 

And so, I removed a fragment of myself and sent it to Earth. I left the system as I transferred my consciousness into the fragment, taking on a new form I didn&#39;t expect. 

A human.
