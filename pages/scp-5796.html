**Special Containment Procedures:** --The control tower on which SCP-5796 is mounted is to be guarded at all times by two Foundation security officers, disguised as Travel Security Administration agents. Two Foundation meteorologists are to be stationed inside the control tower, disguised as air traffic controllers.--

SCP-5796 is to be stored in a fortified concrete bunker at Area-5796. Upon the occurrence of a &#34;Tempest Event&#34;, all personnel are to take shelter inside the facility until ordered otherwise.  In the event that the meteorological phenomenon is considered high-risk per the included list of &#34;High-Risk Phenomena,&#34;  Area-5796 is to enter lockdown for the duration of the event and MTF Kairos-1 &#34;Storm Chasers&#34; is to be deployed to aid in the evacuation of cities, confiscation of media regarding the event, and amnestization of witnesses.  

Additionally, all sites in a 700km radius are to be notified of the event to ensure their continued safety. 
 
All media regarding the event is to be confiscated and destroyed and all witnesses are to be administered Class B amnestics. In the event of a geographically impossible phenomenon manifesting, a disinformation campaign is to be conducted, describing the event as a consequence of climate change. Conflicting media is to be suppressed.

|caption=SCP-5796 upon discovery
]]

SCP-5796 will activate upon detecting an approaching meteorologic phenomenon which is within the mesoscale[[footnote]]Meteorological phenomena which have horizontal scales ranging from a few kilometers to several hundred.[[/footnote]] category or higher. At this stage, SCP-5796 will enter an active state and begin spinning rapidly. SCP-5796 will then trigger a &#34;Tempest Event&#34;

A &#34;Tempest Event&#34; involves SCP-5796 changing the approaching phenomenon to a different random one, this new phenomenon will appear directly above SCP-5796 and is able to completely ignore geographic and weather-pattern limitations of the zone in question.

SCP-5796 has manifested a total of twenty five (25) different meteorological phenomena. (//See &#34;**Document-5796-A**&#34; in the &#34;**Tempest Event Log**&#34;//)

**Discovery:** SCP-5796 was discovered mounted in Control Tower 4 of //El Dorado//  Airport, Colombia, after multiple reports from airport officials about &#34;sudden and unexpected changes in weather&#34;. Agents posing as airport staff were introduced into the airport and after seventy-four (74) days and five (5) &#34;Tempest Events&#34;, SCP-5796 was successfully located and went into Foundation custody.

**Incident Report 5796.1:** On 15/05/2013, an intense thunderstorm was detected by Foundation meteorologists. SCP-5796 subsequently triggered a &#34;Tempest Event&#34;. Below is a transcription of the recording of the events.
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
= [[size 150%]] **[RECORDING START]**[[/size]]

**Meteorologist González:** We have a thunderstorm coming, radar&#39;s gonna activate in a bit.

**Meteorologist Morales:** What do you think it&#39;ll summon today?

**Meteorologist González:** If I had to guess I&#39;d say either rain or hail, they seem to be the most common ones.

**Meteorologist Morales:** It would be interesting if it spawned something like... snow! We could finally see something new.

**Meteorologist González:** Wanna bet? Rain versus snow.

**Meteorologist Morales:** Sure, winner gets a snack from the vending machine down at the lobby.

**Meteorologist González:** Deal.

**Meteorologist González:** Alright the storm&#39;s about to hit us, I&#39;m starting the uhh, &#34;Tempest Event&#34; recording.

(//Meteorologist González grabs his voice recorder and begins a &#34;Tempest Event&#34; report//)

**Meteorologist González:** This is González reporting from Tower 4, //El Dorado// Airport, Colombia. A thunderstorm is approaching and SCP-5796 is about to activate.

**Meteorologist Morales:** Alright, let&#39;s see what it spawns now.

(//SCP-5796 activates//)

**Meteorologist González:** Hmm... seems like wind speed is picking up.

**Meteorologist Morales:** Don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s just going to spawn wind.

**Meteorologist González:** I don&#39;t think this is just wind.

**Meteorologist Morales:** What do you mea- wow what is that!? Is there a train passing by?

**Meteorologist González:** A train? No trains go through here. This is an airport.

**Meteorologist Morales:** Alright then what the hell is making that sou-

(//A car can be seen being picked up by the wind and being dropped to the ground//)

**Meteorologist Morales:** Oh no, oh no no no.

**Meteorologist González:** Did you see that!? This is not wind, this is a tornado!.

**Meteorologist Morales:** Oh fuck fuck fuck. We need to evacuate the airport, NOW.

(//Meteorologist González speaks through the intercom//)

**Meteorologist González:** This is not a drill. I repeat. This is not a drill. There is a tornado on the airport&#39;s premises. Evacuate the area immediately.

(//Meteorologist González repeats the message several times before communication is cut with the intercom//)

**Meteorologist Morales:** Great, what now?

**Meteorologist González:** The tornado must have cut the electricity.

(//Control Tower 4 loses power//)

**Meteorologist Morales:** Alright, you gave out the warning, now let&#39;s get the fuck out of here before we di-

(//The roof of Control Tower 4 is ripped off by the tornado//)

**Meteorologist Morales:** Shit shit shit, take cover!

**Meteorologist González:** I can&#39;t hear shit!

**Meteorologist Morales:** Come on, we have to get the fuck out of here!

**Meteorologist González:** It&#39;s way too strong, I can&#39;t move!

(//Meteorologist González is picked up by the tornado, subject is able to grab to a loose steel rebar//)

**Meteorologist Morales:** Shit shit shit. Grab my hand Leo!

**Meteorologist González:** (//Screams//) Please don&#39;t leave me to die!

**Meteorologist Morales:** I can&#39;t hold you for much longer. My fucking arm&#39;s about to break!

**Meteorologist González:** Please please please, I don&#39;t want to die!

**Meteorologist Morales:** I can&#39;t. Hold. On to you!

(//Meteorologist Morales lets go of Meteorologist González//)

**Meteorologist Morales:** Godammit, fuck fuck fuck!

(//The camera cuts out, only audio remains//)

(//Nothing is heard for the next 7 minutes//)

**Meteorologist Morales:** It&#39;s gone, the tornado is gone.

(//Meteorologist Morales sits in silence for another 5 minutes before breaking into tears//)

**Meteorologist Morales:** I let him go. He&#39;s gone because of me!

**Meteorologist Morales:** He&#39;s gone...

----
Meteorologist Morales suffered from moderate injuries to his right arm and legs, Meteorologist González&#39;s body was found 30 meters away from Control Tower 4.

Meteorologist González&#39;s life plus 2 civilian lives were lost. All witnesses were given class B amnestics and all media reports regarding the event were destroyed. A disinformation campaign describing the event as a &#34;Strong explosion due to gas leak which heavily damaged //El Dorado// Airport&#34; was released. Moderate damage was done to //El Dorado// Airport, Colombia. Reconstruction was finished three (3) weeks after the event.

**Closing notes:** SCP-5796 manifested a tornado, this is the first instance of SCP-5796 manifesting a dangerous phenomenon. The life of Leonardo González was lost. This is a sad day for all the members assigned to this project, we mourn the loss of our fellow researcher and hope his family can find peace with his departure.

Request attempted extraction of SCP-5796 and transport to a new area, far away from any cities. Request SCP-5796 be reclassified from Vlam to Keneq and from Caution to Warning. -Dr. Franco

**Requests Granted**

(//SCP-5796 has been transported to the newly built Area-5796//)

**Addendum-5796-2:**  Dr. Franco&#39;s &#34;Tempest Event&#34; Log

After SCP-5796 was moved to Area-5796, Dr. Franco was assigned to document all subsequent &#34;Tempest Events&#34;.

&#34;Tempest Events&#34; which exhibit new results will be documented below.

**Note:** Events with repeated results not shown.

**Meteorological conditions Pre-Tempest Event:** Storm

**Meteorological conditions Post-Tempest Event:** Snowstorm

**Duration:** 7 hours

**Size of phenomenon:** 789mt²

**Additional notes:** The &#34;Tempest Event&#34; manifested a snowstorm. The snowstorm did not seem affected by the fact that Area-5796 is located in tropical climate, where snow should not theoretically fall. It seems the meteorological phenomena manifested by SCP-5796 are unaffected by the geographical constraints of their current location. This information would explain the manifestation of the tornado in //El Dorado// Airport. -Dr. Franco

**Additional notes:** SCP-5796 manifested a blizzard. This is the largest phenomenon that SCP-5796 has manifested so far.

MTF Kairos-1 &#34;Storm Chasers&#34; was deployed. All media regarding the event was confiscated and destroyed and a disinformation campaign describing the event as a consequence of climate change was launched. All witnesses were administered Class B amnestics.

This is the third instance of geographically impossible phenomena being manifested by SCP-5796. It has been concluded that phenomena manifested by SCP-5796 are able to disregard the geographic constraints of the zone where they are located. -Dr. Franco

**Personal note:** We had a major incident with the radar, all of a sudden a cyclone appeared, ripped the facility into pieces. Not only that but it affected several other sites and cities. We lost seventeen (17) people total.

Knowing that that thing can do so much damage and it&#39;s just laying around in a containment chamber. We can&#39;t destroy it, I want to but we can&#39;t. I want to just throw it in the ocean and forget about it, never see it again. Even then, we can&#39;t neutralize it without approval from the O5 command. The amount of stress it has put on me and everyone else here. But we can&#39;t get rid of it, we have to contain it, we&#39;re the best bet at preventing another disaster like this and I promise; if something like this happens again we //WILL// be ready, we will be... -Dr. Franco

**Personal note:** We had another one of these, this time an anticyclone. The thing by itself wasn&#39;t so bad but the heatwave it caused? It was devastating. It affected six different countries, //SIX// different countries. I said we would be ready and we were, at least for the anticyclone, but for the heatwave? No, no one was expecting it, and surely not at such a large scale. Our MTF&#39;s out helping the affected countries, even with their help we&#39;ve lost more than 80 people.

You know what they say though, &#34;fight fire with fire&#34;, change the climate but make it worse at the same time. 

When was the last time the radar summoned something small, something not dangerous?

I just want this to stop, I don&#39;t want anyone else to be hurt. But I can&#39;t. Do. ANYTHING.

**Dr. Franco:** It&#39;s done, the last thing we needed.... a hurricane, great. We managed to save some more lives this time but people //still// died. All because of that radar. I can&#39;t, it&#39;s too much to deal with. All the stress from evacuating the cities, preventing any more deaths, leading this whole operation. It&#39;s just too much, even with the help of our MTF.

I don&#39;t know how much longer I can keep doing this. The hurricane is still out there destroying everything and I’m just here recording this log instead of being able to help. 

I never knew the people that died and I never //will// know them but it still feels like my responsibility to keep them safe. I- I see them as if they were my family I had to protect, like they mean a lot to me. Maybe that&#39;s what stresses me out so much, I don&#39;t know. If my family ever was in a situation like that or, pray to God it doesn&#39;t happen but... I lose them. I don&#39;t know what I would do, I think I would lose myself. Not having them would be lik-

Wait...

Oh shit, oh shit no.
I forgot to call them, oh god. I forgot to check on them.

All this shit going on I forgot oh god I forgot. Please be okay please be okay.

(//Dr. Franco picks up his phone and attempts a call//)

Oh god please pick up, please pick up.

(//The phone is answered//)

**Dr. Franco:** Hi? Hi, how are you doing?

**████████ ██████:** Dad? Dad oh god thank god you&#39;re okay. We tried to reach you but back at our house all the power lines are gone, we had no service there.

**Dr. Franco:** Oh thank god you&#39;re okay sweetie, how&#39;s everyone doing? God I&#39;m so sorry for not calling you before I just-

**████████ ██████:** Don&#39;t worry Dad, I know you&#39;re busy with your work at the weather station monitoring all this, just- don&#39;t worry about it.

**Dr. Franco:**  No I //should// be worried, I haven&#39;t been in contact with you since this started.

Wait, how&#39;s ████ doing?

**████████ ██████:** She&#39;s... she&#39;s uh, injured. 

**Dr. Franco:** What?! She&#39;s injured?? And you didn&#39;t think of telling me?!? What were you thinking?

**████████ ██████:** Dad just calm down, we&#39;re getting to the hospital right now, I couldn&#39;t call you before, we had no signal. We-

**Dr. Franco:** Then why didn&#39;t you call me as soon as you got signal?!

**████████ ██████:** I just, I just didn&#39;t want to put any more stress on you.

**Dr. Franco:** But she&#39;s my wife, you should have told me as soon as you could.

**████████ ██████:** And she&#39;s my mom, do you think you&#39;re the only one having a hard time?! We rushed to the hospital as soon as it happened, █████&#39;s been driving this whole time, everyone is stressed right now.

**Dr. Franco:** I know I- I&#39;m sorry. Just- please let me speak to her.

(//The phone is passed//)

**Dr. Franco:** Hi?! Hi, ████ how are you doing?

**████:** Hi? Oh hi ████, I&#39;m- I got hit by debris, we&#39;re close to the hospital.

**Dr. Franco:** Where were you hit?!

**████:** //cough//, I got hit in the back and in the arm, some rubble came flying in and hit me //cough//.

**Dr. Franco:** Just- just hold on, I&#39;ll go as soon as I can.

**████:** No- I know that this whole hurricane is a big problem for you just-. I&#39;ll be fine.

**Dr. Franco:** No I //have// to go I- I need to be with you.

**████:** I already told you //cough// you stay there and monitor the hurricane, you&#39;ll be more useful helping out there than coming here.

**Dr. Franco:** Okay just- I want you to know I- I love you, I love each one of you.

(//The call ends//)

Oh god I- I- //I// let this happen, this is //my// fault, this is-

I should have protected them, I- I didn&#39;t do enough

Ah fuck I- shit I left this thing running. Just- //sigh//.

I can&#39;t, I can&#39;t anymore...
