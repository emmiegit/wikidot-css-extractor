**Special Containment Procedures:** As SCP-5796 is only accessible on Foundation servers, civilian interference is unlikely. All Foundation members are to remain unaware of the web address of SCP-5796, and any personnel without Level 4 clearance attempting to, or have already accessed SCP-5796 are to be reprimanded and punished. All testing with SCP-5796 must go through Site Director Amelia Werchester.

**Description:** SCP-5796 is a dating website, named &#34;Soulmate Connection Program,&#34; that is exclusively accessible via Foundation servers. The site cannot be blocked or removed through any known means, including redirection. SCP-5796 generates dating profiles for all individuals affiliated with the Foundation, including D-Class personnel, humanoid anomalies,[[footnote]] With limited internet access. [[/footnote]] and the O5 council.

[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-5796/soulmateconnectionprogram.png|caption=SCP-5796&#39;s logo.|width=200px]]

These profiles contain personal information, such as legal name, age, and gender preference, and are created without the knowledge of the individuals in question. However, the text style of the profiles is consistent with the manner in which the person would write.

SCP-5796 is equipped with several features, such as a private messaging system, customizable profiles, and a site search function, which showcases a list of every Foundation site, with all employed personnel. Any personnel accessing SCP-5796 will automatically be logged in to their assigned profile, with no option to log out or delete their account. SCP-5796 does not create accounts for individuals who are in a relationship.[[footnote]] This excludes those in polyamorous relationships seeking more than one partner. [[/footnote]]

__Journal Entry 5/19/2013__
&gt; So turns out, there&#39;s an SCP dating website. Great. Fun! The higher ups don&#39;t know where this came from nor do anyone else. Guess it&#39;s just something random that fucks us over. Gonna run a few tests on this thing, tell &#39;em if I see anything unusual.
&gt; I was told to write down my notes, but I&#39;m out of paper. On the file it goes.

__Journal Entry 5/21/2013__
&gt; Real creepy invasion of privacy. I checked my &#34;profile&#34;, and it was way to detailed for my liking. Written how I talk, including pics of myself. Even knows about my cat. Gross. I&#39;m gonna avoid checking other people&#39;s profiles for now.

__Journal Entry 5/22/2013__
&gt; Got a notif in the corner that said &#34;All Alone on a Wednesday Night? God, you&#39;re pathetic.&#34;
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; Fuck you too, SCP-5796. I&#39;m done testing.

__Journal Entry 5/26/2013__
&gt; Fine. Fine, I&#39;ll continue checking this site out.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; Looking through all the different sites, you don&#39;t need to be a person to use this, since I found Dr. Crow. That&#39;s fun. I looked at Site-19, didn&#39;t catalogue any anomalies below 18 so that&#39;s uh. Good as well. Gonna keep looking, lemme jot this down.

**PROPOSED REVISION:** These profiles contain personal information, such as legal name, age, and gender preference, and are created without the knowledge of the individuals in question. However, the text style of the profiles is consistent with the manner in which the person would write. **All profiles on SCP-5796 are persons who are above the age of eighteen, and are completely aware and able to consent romantically and sexually.**

&gt; Gonna need to change the wording but hey, I got plenty of time. I&#39;ll continue to update it.

__Journal Entry 5/27/2013__
&gt; Turns out I&#39;m not the only person using this site, either I gotta punish someone or act like I&#39;m completely oblivious. She commented on my profile, lemme copy it real quick.

&gt;&gt; I would say you&#39;re in major trouble, but I don&#39;t want you reporting me to the others. So keep this between us.

&gt; Others? Interesting. Says her name is Kaitlan Ademola. I think, I&#39;ll check that again later.

&gt; Alright I need to log some other stuff. That&#39;s what this journal is for.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; There&#39;s options to like posts and comments, and &#34;follow&#34; people, showing their posts. These posts are stuff whatever these people are doing, taken by..someone. Can&#39;t tell who, no reflection or anything.
&gt; Gonna spy a bit on other people. Just for testing purposes.

**PROPOSED REVISION:** These profiles contain personal information, such as legal name, age, and gender preference, and are created without the knowledge of the individuals in question. However, the text style of the profiles is consistent with the manner in which the person would write. All profiles on SCP-5796 are persons who are above the age of eighteen, and are completely aware and able to consent romantically and sexually. **Frequently, the profiles will update with recent events for whatever person.**

&gt; I&#39;ll make it better later. Just got to text her back.

&gt; Jesus fuckin&#39; christ. I&#39;m sitting here, browsing her profile. I need to go touch grass. I contemplated commenting &#34;kind of a MILF&#34; under one of her pics but I realized I feel like such a creep doing that. Gonna take a break, check up with you again later.

__Journal Entry 6/9/2013__
&gt; Alright, I&#39;m doin&#39; better. Someone walked into my office but thankfully he was completely oblivious to me oogling at some ladies profile. Just told him it&#39;s some scp reports and he did what he needed i guess. It was something about testing with SCP-whatever so I gave him the pass.
&gt; Made me realize how weird I am. Gonna need a few more days to myself.

&gt; She messaged me sdfaskhfhk
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; We chatted for a little bit and she is a lot more down to earth than I first thought, incredibly nice, even called me &#34;hun&#34;. She seems to know a bit about me but I got no clue. Might be another supervisor, her profile doesn&#39;t list where she works. Probably not relevant. I hope.

__Journal Entry 6/13/2013__
&gt; Talked some more.
&gt; Both of us like Talking Heads, she told me she saw them live once. Told her that we should meet up someday. She said her job takes up the majority of her time but she will try to fit me into her schedule. I want her so bad it&#39;s drivin me mad. (yknow. beatles reference. i still want her either way)
&gt; Looked at her profile more, she loves books. I typically don&#39;t read for fun but I&#39;ll try sometime later.

__Journal Entry 6/16/2013__
&gt; Chatted more, she wasn&#39;t as active but it&#39;s clear she&#39;s interested. Lemme grab a screenshot..

__Journal Entry 6/18/2013__
&gt; Met her in person. She&#39;s a lot taller than I first thought. Not that its a bad thing of course (I like tall girls) but me being 5&#39;5 and her being like. I think almost six feet was awkward. We went to this nice restaurant, we didn&#39;t mention work.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; She was a lot nicer in person. Kept her formal way of speaking. Gonna see if we can do something else later.

__Journal Entry 6/20/2013__
&gt; Continued to chat, I got her number now at least. She told me she was really busy for the weekend, decided to actually focus on work stuff for now. I&#39;ll update this later.

__Journal Entry 6/21/2013__
&gt; We talked about our life at home. Told her about my cat, Elvis Pawsley. She thought the name was really cute. I asked about her pets but she said she never had one, which makes me sad.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; Maybe I can invite her over? She might like Elvis.

__Journal Entry 6/23/2013__
&gt; I told her about my family. She reminds me of my mom a bit. This doesn&#39;t say anything about me, does it?
&gt; God damn it, Freud. You win again.

__Journal Entry 6/25/2013__
&gt; Went on another date with her. Second one, this time to a much cheaper place to see if she y&#39;know. Isn&#39;t in it for the money.
