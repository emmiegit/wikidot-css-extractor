Scintillating Hate - Ansiel&#39;s Theme - by [[*user Mr Carbon]]
[[/&gt;]]
----
Mammon Istjur Ansiel, The Constrainer, Vice Corporate Archdemon of the House of the Fly sat by his penthouse pool and sipped hot bloodwine out of a solid gold skull.

The artificial sun above the 4th circle of Hell shined at just the perfect intensity: just bright enough to make the recently deceased and lesser demons uncomfortable, and warm enough to make the exoskeleton feel nice and toasty. Another beautiful day in a tropical paradise at the expense of all the larva below. Ansiel loved his job. He loved his home. He loved the gold and marble statues of wealth and Mammon that dotted Greed&#39;s landscape. He loved the warm beaches, purple skies, teal palm trees and blue sparkling ocean that surrounded him. And he loved the golden, shining city he helped build.

Ansiel stretched his mandibles and wings out. Christmas was not a holiday most demons celebrated, or even felt comfortable thinking about, but Ansiel was different. He saw bigger. He understood more than most what the the holiday truly meant; what its true spirit really was.

Christmas was a sweatshop owner grinding human souls into luxury goods. A CEO getting a fat year end bonus after laying off half his employees. A father spending money meant for his children&#39;s presents on a horse race for himself. Christmas was a price tag. A commodity. A desire. Christmas was Greed.

Christmas was a business. And for Ansiel, business was //always// good.

[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/sol-invictus/HotFlyDorkDrinksBloodFromASkull.png]]

... Or the very least, business would keep him from feeling too lonely this time of year.

Ansiel gave a wistful sigh and poured himself another drink when he felt his phone buzz.

Ansiel set his phone down, gave a big stretch, and clapped two more gold skull cups into existence. His pooltop was expensive, both in terms of cost and scale. It was made out of solid purple-white marble, gold and rimmed with exotic tropical flora. It would be nice to enjoy it with company for once. After filling both of the extra skulls, he brought up his chair to the sitting up position, and settled back down. It wouldn’t be long.

And he was right. Primrose appeared in a burst of flames, the sparks dispersing much like petals in the tropical breeze. Dressed in her swimsuit, she smiled. “Ansiel!”

“Prim! Wonderful to see you again, my dear!” Ansiel raised his glass. Then, he looked around. “Where’s Adrian?”

She gave a polite bow. “The feeling is mutual. And they are falling.”

“Oh?”

Primrose simply pointed upwards, above the pool. Adrian’s distant, adrenaline-induced screams became audible, as they cannonballed into the pool. Creating an impressive splash that left a small, beautiful rainbow hovering above.

Adrian rose from the water. It took a moment for Ansiel to see that Adrian had changed their form. In contrast to their usual puppy-imp self, they were now back to the height and proportions they had when they were alive, looking lithe and lean in their lyrca swimming trunks.

Adrian swam to the edge of the pool and looked up at Ansiel and Primrose in a slight daze. “That… was fuckin&#39; //awesome.&#34;//

“How high were you?” Prim tilted her head

“I’m sober at the moment. But I pretty much fell from about the same height of that sun.” They replied blowing water out their nose.

“Nice height. I’d be lying if I haven’t done that myself every now and again.&#34; He handed Adrian a gold skull cup filled with bloodwine. &#34;Here, for Hell&#39;s best paralegal, and my favorite 4&#39;11&#39;&#39; short king...  And here,&#34; Ansiel handed the last cup over to Primrose, who had now taken up residence on the sunlounger next to him. &#34;for Hell&#39;s best Whore and true heiress to the Throne of Violence.&#34;

&#34;Oh, you flatter us too much, Ansiel.&#34; Primrose brought rim of the skull up to her nose to give the wine a quick sniff. The bloodwine&#39;s aroma was sweet and honey-like with just a hint of lavender to it. She took a small sip and let out a small hum of pleasure as she felt it go down. Smooth and opulent and absolutely //dripping// in sin. &#34;... Good lords, you were not joking about this wine.&#34; Primrose took a deeper, second sip and meditated on its taste a bit more. &#34;This... is from a demon. I can taste the soulstuff. Fresh, male, likely… 400 years old, at the time of harvest... Do you know who this was?”

“A Mr. Durcath,&#34; Ansiel replied. &#34;We caught him embezzling from our maintenance accounts, so we had his… non-vital assets liquidated. In more ways than one, of course.” He chuckled and swirled the wine in his gold skull gently. “You know how the Mammons are. Flay &#39;em, and send &#39;em back to the bottom of the totem pole when you’ve had your fun. He’s back to being a little grub on the Production Line now.”

Adrian finished guzzling down their skull of wine in a single gulp. &#34;Oh yeah, you can taste the distilled //bastard// from this one. Ya got any more?&#34; 

&#34;But of course,&#34; Ansiel claps his hands and summons a pyramid of golden skulls by the edge of the pool, all filled to the brim with fresh bloodwine. &#34;Enjoy yourself, Adrian dear, it&#39;s Christmas after all.&#34;

&#34;Oh, fuck //yes!//&#34; Adrian wasted no time pulling themselves up from the pool and pounding skulls of bloodwine down their throat.

&#34;Speaking of Christmas...&#34; Primrose chimed. &#34;As I said prior, I am organizing a small get-together that you would be //very// interested in joining.&#34;

&#34;Oh, would I now?...&#34; Ansiel said, intrigued.

&#34;Oh, yeah you would,&#34; said Adrian by the pool side, 3 skulls deep into the wine pyramid. &#34;We scored you a date, buddy!&#34;

Ansiel cocked a skeptical eyebrow and lowered his sunglasses. &#34;... A date? Really? That&#39;s... definitely not what I was expecting.&#34; Ansiel ran his middle finger around the rim of his skull cup. &#34;Alright, you had my curiosity before but now you have my interest... Who is it?&#34;

Primrose paused for a moment as she tapped a finger against her lips, she smiled as she anticipated Ansiel&#39;s reaction. &#34;Just a colleague of mine.&#34;

&#34;... From the SCP Foundation? Well, that doesn&#39;t make any sense, who exactly would-&#34; Ansiel stopped mid-sentence, his mandibles hanging open and his eyes opened wide. &#34;... No, you //didn&#39;t//... did you?&#34;

&#34;Yes, I did. We would like to formally invite you to our now triple-date on the 23rd of December. Myself and Astia, Adrian and Morningstar, and yourself and //Sheldon Katz.&#34;//

&#34;NO. //WAY!&#34;// Ansiel shouted, his voice was a mix of anxiety and excitement, fear and desire. Ansiel couldn&#39;t believe it. He couldn&#39;t stop his insectoid wings from buzzing nor his hands from trembling, spilling expensive bloodwine onto the marble below.

&#34;Oh //yes// way,&#34; slurred Adrian, now 6 skulls deep and feeling slightly tipsy. &#34;Me and Prim are playing matchmaker and we&#39;re getting our two favorite terminal workaholics together.&#34;

&#34;Quite,&#34; Primrose nodded. &#34;Now, of course a busy demon like yourself may not be free for the holidays, so I understand if you were to decline-&#34;

//&#34;NO!!&#34;// Ansiel roared. It took a second for him to realize just how loudly he had shouted, a deep pink blush spread across his face as he covered his mouth with his fingers. &#34;I-I-I mean... N-no, I can make time for this. I can cancel some appointments and move some timetables around, it shouldn&#39;t be a problem.&#34;

&#34;Excellent,&#34; Primrose smiled, clapping her hands together. &#34;We have an appointment booked at the Pit of Gehenna. We will be bringing Sheldon along with us, and you can meet us there.&#34;

&#34;Bringing him into Hell? Are you //sure// that&#39;s a wise idea.&#34;

&#34;Between the 5 of us, I highly doubt anyone would want to risk doing something foolish. Sheldon would be surrounded by 5 of the most formidable beings in Hell itself. Besides, he would not be the first mortal in Hell. Everyone would think he was just a warlock or something... That is not too far from the truth, actually.&#34;

Ansiel was quiet for a moment, he swirled the red liquid still left in the gold skull in his hand. &#34;Well... if you&#39;re sure then. I&#39;ll play the Virgil to his Dante.&#34;  He went in for one last sip.

&#34;You know...&#34; began Adrian, as they sat upon a makeshift throne of now empty gold skulls. &#34;Sheldon thought you were a //succubus// this whole time.&#34;

Ansiel choked and nearly dropped his skull. He doubled over and coughed out the remainder of his bloodwine onto a nearby towel.

&#34;Adrian!&#34; Primrose admonished.

&#34;Aw come on, Prim! I couldn&#39;t help it.&#34; Adrian said, laughing atop their skull throne.

Ansiel&#39;s coughing finally died down as he slowly regained his composure. A succubus? Really? Did Sheldon Katz truly think a high ranking member of the Mammon Dynasty would be a mere //submissive?// It was a bold move, a real power play, if anything. If it were anyone else, Ansiel would have seen that as a professional challenge to his position and he would react... accordingly.

Yet, instead of anger, he felt his face turn a deep red as he thought about what Sheldon said. //A Succubus...// Just why did hearing that make Ansiel&#39;s blackened angelic heart beat so hard in his chest? Why did the thought of Sheldon looking at him as a submissive make him feel so... so...

Ansiel couldn&#39;t even think. Couldn&#39;t even place the emotion. No one had ever made him feel this way before. 

So... nervous.

So... //excited.//

&#34;Alright,&#34; Ansiel cleared his throat and tried his best to move on and not acknowledge what Adrian had just said &#34;...this is all sounds well and good but what&#39;s the catch here?&#34;

&#34;The catch, dear Ansiel...&#34; began Primrose. &#34;Is that this will be a //social// occasion, which means I want you to turn off //&#39;Business Mode&#39;// and have a little fun for once.&#34;

&#34;Well, I... suppose I could do that,&#34; pondered Ansiel.

&#34;Wonderful.&#34;

&#34;After all, I can&#39;t miss this opportunity to recruit Mr. Katz into Mammon Industries™.&#34;

Primrose was silent for a moment. //&#34;...Ansiel.&#34;//

&#34;Yes, yes, I know, //social// occasion.&#34; Ansiel rolled his eyes. &#34;I&#39;m not going to subject him to another days long legal battle, Primrose. I&#39;ll bring it up to him as something to consider and leave it there. I&#39;m not gonna let Mr. Katz waste his time with the minor leagues in the Living Worlds without letting him know what his //true// potential is. I have too much professional admiration for him to let that happen.&#34;

&#34;Look, Ansiel this-&#34; Primrose paused and blinked. &#34;I am sorry but... //professional admiration?&#34;//

&#34;Of course,&#34; Ansiel said and crossed his legs. &#34;I... admire Mr. Katz and his skills as a lawyer quite a bit as you know. And a mortal too! I mean, lords, I was shaking just now thinking about it.&#34;

Primrose could only stare at him, completely silent and utterly dumbfounded, her jaw slightly agape and her eyes blinking. &#34;Wait, are you telling me that what you are feeling for Sheldon Kats is //just//... &#39;professional admiration?&#39;&#34;

&#34;Well... I mean...&#34; Ansiel broke eye contact with prim and looked to the side. &#34;It obviously is. What else could it be?&#34;

Adrian let out a large snort that led into a full blown belly laugh. &#34;Prim, holy //SHIT//, that&#39;s so fuckin&#39; funny, I think I&#39;m gonna AH-&#34; They leaned back too far, too tipsy to remember how just precarious their golden throne truly was, and fell back into the pool, the skulls falling with them.

Primrose sighed and stood up. &#34;Alright, Ansiel, //&#39;professional admiration&#39;// it is then. Come along.&#34;

Ansiel stood up and stretched, excitement and fear filling his limbs. &#34;Where are we going?&#34;

&#34;Your wardrobe, dear. Let us pick an outfit out for our little dinner date.&#34; Primrose walked towards the interior of the penthouse.

&#34;Alrighty then,&#34; Ansiel clapped and de-manifested the skulls they were all using. He could hear Adrian climbing out of the pool, coughing out some water and following right behind them. &#34;...Do you two think he&#39;d like my current form? I know the fly-slash-insect look can be unsettling to some mortals.&#34;

&#34;Oh, I wouldn&#39;t worry about it&#34; replied Adrian,
