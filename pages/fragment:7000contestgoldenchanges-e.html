]]

**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-7000-1 and SCP-7000-2 are to be kept in a 20cm by 20cm by 20cm box made out of twin coated aluminium, each layer 20mm thick, separated by 2 millimetres of vacuum. The container is to be inspected every 20 hours by authorised personnel to make sure that there is no corrosion or cracks within the aluminium coating and that the vacuum is sustained. If it is discovered that the vacuum environment is lost, the anomalies are to be transferred to a new container immediately. The personnel inspecting SCP-7000 are to be changed in regular intervals of two weeks. 

**Description:**

SCP-7000 refers to two six faced, cube-shaped black dice, both one centimeter in height, length and width. The dice have standard numbers etched onto their faces, opposite sides adding up to seven, except for one of the die, SCP-7000-1, which has a symbol of a handshake on one of its sides instead of the one. 

The dice are made out of an unknown material, which very much resembles plastic, both in weight and reflectivity. This material scores 6.2 from the Mohs Hardness Test (MHT), nearly that of steel. Additionally, the material can stand 1103.5 mPA of pressure with no apparent fracturing or bending. Hardness and pressure resistance testing on SCP-7000-2 has caused slight internal damage, resulting in a fracture on the side marked as five. 

The anomalous effects of the dice manifest when at least one of them is in close proximity to a person. These people, hereby known as SCP-7000-A instances, will, from that point on, experience a major amount of events that can be considered ‘lucky’. The probability of these events occurring normally will, over time, lower, and some of these events may even be considered impossible under normal circumstances.

Examples of this phenomenon include precisely guessing lottery numbers, winning in games that would be identified as gambling, and repeatedly being able to manipulate the results of a coin-flip. Luck in situations not defined by computable probability, such as being able to survive usually fatal gunshots or crashes and being able to accurately and exactly predict someone’s personal info, have also been observed. //(See Testing Log A and B for more info.)//



[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Addendum 7000.1: Discovery&#34; hide=&#34;- Addendum 7000.1: Discovery&#34;]]

The Interreality Communications and Relations Department, hereby IRCR, discovered a Class-Δ abnormality in Epsilon-5, reality 102, on 21.3.2019 under Project Probinum. ICRC staff were unable to identify the source of the abnormality. On 1.4.2019, another abnormality was detected, this time identified as Class-C. 

From the 4th of April to the 7th of April, the ICRC Computers and equipment received a complete overhaul, meaning reality 102, and all realities in Project Probinum, were not tracked in the 72 hour period. On 10.4.2019, the ICRC was able to establish a connection with reality 102. The ICRC had limited connection to the internet and could send, pick up or intercept certain wavelengths of radiation. On the 11th, a proposal was made to increase the resources allocated to researching reality 102, which was accepted.

On 12.11.2019, the source of one of the abnormalities was pinpointed to a Jack Midway Doyle, hereby SCP-7000-A1, a male adult living in Wisconsin, Madison. It was discovered that SCP-7000-A1 was titled “The Luckiest Man Alive” by multiple news publications and television broadcasters in reality 102. It was suspected that SCP-7000-A1 had some connection with an anomalous entity or was anomalous themselves. 

On the 14th, Dr. Erika Braum and her team were assigned with establishing communications with SCP-7000-A1. They ran extensive background checks and attempted to contact SCP-7000-A1 via his cellular device on three separate occasions on the 14th and 15th, all of which failed. The team also attempted to display a message on SCP-7000-A1’s TV screen on the morning of the 15th, however the attempt was a failure and the TV screen only displayed static for a couple of seconds. 

First successful contact with SCP-7000-A1 was made on the 16th of April by the IRCR, after which SCP-7000 was located and secured by MTF Tau-51 (Urban Brawl). (See Addendum 7000.2 for the transcript of the interview.)

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**BACKGROUND INFORMATION**

Dr. Erika Braum is a senior researcher and communications expert in the IRCR, specializing in communication with high importance targets. Ms. Braum has also contributed greatly to Project Probinum, significantly improving the connection time and strength of inter-reality calls. 

SCP-7000-A1 is an adult male from reality 102, named Jack Midway Doyle, thought to have a connection with the abnormality detected in reality 102. 

Dr. Braum was able to communicate with SCP-7000-A1 on 16.4.2019 through his phone personal cellphone.

**Interviewer:** Doctor Erika Braum
**Interviewee:** SCP-7000-A1

------

**[BEGIN LOG]**

**Dr. Braum:** Good evening, Jack Doyle.
**SCP-7000-A1:** Who are you and how do you have my number? I don’t use my personal phone for business-
**Dr. Braum:** This isn’t about a business endeavour, Mr Doyle. And regarding your name, it is one of the many things we know about you.
**SCP-7000-A1:** “We”? Who are you?
**Dr. Braum:** I am Dr. Braum, I am an interreality communications specialist. My job description or who I work for isn’t important. What’s important is that you tell us the truth. 
**SCP-7000-A1:** I- I don’t get it. 
(Several seconds of silence ensues.)
**Dr. Braum:** Well, let’s start simple. When did it start?
**SCP-7000-A1:** What? What do you mean?
**Dr. Braum:** All of this, your empire, so to speak. Your life was rather &#34;tough&#34; until something changed: divorced, poor, lost custody of your child, dad battling with cancer… Until that fateful day. Something must have happened to you on that day, as everything just started going uphill for you.
**SCP-7000-A1**: How the hell do you know all this? Who the hell are you? Some kind of stalker? 
**Dr. Braum:** I promise, as we keep talking, everything- 
//(Dr. Braum is cut off, as SCP-7000-A1 hangs up his cellular device. Communications are reestablished several minutes later.)//
**Dr. Braum:** Mr. Doyle, I don’t believe you know how much effort we put into contacting you. It&#39;s not as easy as dialling a number for us. 
**SCP-7000-A1:** Stop calling me you freaks. Fuck off with that different realities bullshit. 
**Dr. Braum:** Mr. Doyle, I understand it is difficult for you to cope with the current situation, but I implore you to listen to me. 
(Several seconds of silence ensues, finally broken by a very audible gasp from SCP-7000-1.)
**SCP-7000-A1:** Fine. I’ll give you five minutes. 
**Dr. Braum:** So, Mr Doyle. You’ve been labelled “the luckiest man alive” by many. But from what we can tell, you weren’t always so fortunate. Something must have happened to you to facilitate this change. Do you have any ideas as to what might have happened?
**SCP-7000-A1:** I- No, not really. 
**Dr. Braum:** Really? Very well then, do you recall the day you went to your ex-wife’s home to visit your son for his birthday but your ex-wife wouldn&#39;t let you?
**SCP-7000-A1:** What the fuck does this have to do with anything? Fucking asshole-
**Dr. Braum:** It was the day you managed to put your life back together. You couldn’t see your kid, but you got a job offer only a week later. So in essence, it was the last bad thing that happened to you. Did anything special happen to you in that one week period?
**SCP-7000-A1:** I- (Silence ensues for a few seconds.) Yes. I felt like my luck was getting better you know, it- God, this sounds stupid. I went to the pub that evening, right. And me and a couple of my buddies played dice. I’d never won at dice until that day. And-
(Dr. Braum interjects)
**Dr. Braum:** What type of dice did you use?
**SCP-7000-A1:** I brought them myself. They’re my lucky dice, I’ve kept them ever since.
**Dr. Braum:** How did you get a hold of the dice?
**SCP-7000-A1:** Uhh, they were from a... Monopoly set I had bought.
**Dr. Braum:** Right. Tell me more about the Monopoly set, where’d you buy it, when, is there anything special about the box it came in, you get the picture. 
**SCP-7000-A1:** What, why are you asking me all this? I don’t get it. 
**Dr. Braum:** With all due respect, Mr. Doyle, please cooperate with me. I’ve tried my best to be charitable with you, and I’m not one to use coercion, especially in such a situation.
//(A few seconds of silence ensues, only broken by an audible sigh from SCP-7000-A1)//
SCP-7000-A1: I think I still have the box, I’ll go check really quick. But afterwards, I want a real good fucking explanation.
Dr. Braum: Certainly, you give some, you get some. 
//(Footsteps, opening and closing of doors and drawers can be heard.)//
SCP-7000-A1: Alright. I’ve got it. It’s just a Monopoly set. Now tell me what the fuck is going on, will you?
Dr. Braum: Describe the set for me. 
//(SCP-7000-A1 can be heard rotating the box on a solid surface. It is also clear from his voice that he is getting irritated.)//
SCP-7000-A1: It says “Monopoly - Las Vegas Edition” on the cover. I don’t know how else to explain it. It’s fucking Monopoly. 
Dr. Braum: Anything out of the ordinary?
SCP-7000-A1: I don’t know…
Dr. Braum: Mr. Doyle, would you be kind enough to look up the Las Vegas themed Monopoly set on the internet please?
SCP-7000-A1: //(Mumbling)// Fuck’s sake.
//(SCP-7000-A1 can be heard typing on his keyboard)//
SCP-7000-A1: Okay, now what?
Dr. Braum: Take a close look, is there really no difference between the original and the one you have?
SCP-7000-A1: Uhh- No. 
Dr. Braum: That complicates things-
SCP-7000-A1: Oh, shit.
Dr. Braum: Mr. Doyle?
SCP-7000-A1: The guy’s holding a four leafed clover instead of the stick.
Dr. Braum: I see. And where did you buy the set from?
SCP-7000-A1: Uhh, hold on-
Dr. Braum: Ah, I apologise Mr. Doyle. That was a stupid question from my end. You bought it from the local Toyz”R”Us in Madison.
SCP-7000-A1: The fuck? How do you know all this shit? Who are you?
Dr. Braum: Thank you very much for cooperating, Mr. Doyle. I have a feeling this won’t be the last time we speak.
SCP-7000-A1: Wait, hold on. You told me you were going to explain everything!
Dr. Braum: Take care Mr. Doyle, may the odds be eternally in your favour.
SCP-7000-A1: Wait- 
//(Communications are cut off.)//

**[END LOG]**

**CONCLUSION**

Information about SCP-7000 and the box it was initially packaged with was recorded by Dr. Braum, and passed onto MTF Tau-51 units. SCP-7000-A1 attempted to call IRCR communications again, but the call was left unanswered.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Addendum 7000.3: Testing Logs&#34; hide=&#34;- Addendum 7000.3: Testing Logs&#34;]]

__**7000.3.1: Testing Log A**__

Testing was conducted by Dr. Robert Conwell on the 20th of October, in Site Testing Lab C. Testing reason was to observe whether there was a gradual change in how lucky a SCP-7000-A instance was as time went on.

Subject, Junior Researcher Arin Cross, was handed SCP-7000-1 and was told to hold it for a set amount of time that was increased across tests. After this, an unbiased, random number generator was used to generate a number from 1 to 1000, three times in a row. Subject was asked to guess what the number was each time, and the generated number along with their answers were noted down. Computer program Delta-L [[footnote]] Originally developed by the AIAD for usage in testing probability related anomalies. [[/footnote]] was used to measure accuracy.

**Test 1, 14:01**
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Procedure:** Subject was not given SCP-7000-1, and was asked to  as a controlled test.
**Results:** 

||~  ||~ Subject Response ||~ Generated Number ||
|| Guess 1 || 112 || 243 ||
|| Guess 2 || 476 || 900||
|| Guess 3 || 736 || 378 ||

**Conclusion:** Subject utilized random guessing, and no signs of unexpected probability were detected by Delta-L. No guesses were measured as accurate.
[[/div]]

**Test 2, 14:04**
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Procedure:** Subject was given SCP-7000-1 for 20 minutes.
**Results:** 

||~  ||~ Subject Response ||~ Generated Number ||
|| Guess 1 || 468 || 315 ||
|| Guess 2 || 172 || 257 ||
|| Guess 3 || 682 || 891 ||

**Conclusion:** Delta-L detected guessing odds slightly higher than average, expected odds, showing an increase of precision from Test 1. No guesses were measured as accurate.
[[/div]]

**Test 3, 14:27**
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Procedure:** Subject was given SCP-7000-1 for 40 minutes.
**Results:** 

||~  ||~ Subject Response ||~ Generated Number ||
|| Guess 1 || 128 || 214 ||
|| Guess 2 || 191 || 056 ||
|| Guess 3 || 937 || 986 ||

**Conclusion:** Delta-L once again detected luck in guessing higher than what was expected. Guess 3 was measured as accurate.
[[/div]]

**Test 4, 15:11**
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Procedure:** Subject was given SCP-7000-1 for an hour.
**Results:** 

||~  ||~ Subject Response ||~ Generated Number ||
|| Guess 1 || 291 || 374 ||
|| Guess 2 || 712 || 633 ||
|| Guess 3 || 912 || 840 ||

**Conclusion:** Delta-L reported the probability of the subject&#39;s guesses being this precise to remain close to the same, being slightly higher. However, this time, no guesses were measured as accurate.
[[/div]]

**Test 5, 16:15**
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Procedure:** Subject was given SCP-7000-1 for two hours.
**Results:** 

||~  ||~ Subject Response ||~ Generated Number ||
|| Guess 1 || 092 || 147 ||
|| Guess 2 || 900 || 841 ||
|| Guess 3 || 498 || 433 ||

**Conclusion:** Alerts of potential cheating were brought up by Delta-L, notifying an abnormality in the subject&#39;s luck. Guess 1 and 2 were marked as accurate. 
[[/div]]

**Final, Test 6, 19:00**
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Procedure:** Subject was given SCP-7000-1 for four hours.
**Results:** 

||~  ||~ Subject Response ||~ Generated Number ||
|| Guess 1 || 480 || 440 ||
|| Guess 2 || 316 || 376 ||
|| Guess 3 || 731 || 711 ||

**Conclusion:** Once again, Delta-L alerted possible cheating, but also alerted of the first pattern irregularity, mentioning that all of the subject&#39;s responses shared the same digit as the generated number. Guess 1 and 3 were marked as accurate.
[[/div]]

**Test 7000.3.1 Conclusion:** Testing finished at 23:10. As measured by Delta-L, there was an increase in &#39;luck&#39; in the subject&#39;s guesses. This would not be reasonable to happen in normal circumstances, holding a very low probability, effectively proving that SCP-7000-A instances have more luck in guessing and predictions as time goes on.

__**7000.3.2: Testing Log B**__

Testing was conducted by Dr. Maya Elden on the 27th of October, in Site Testing Lab A and B. Testing reason was to attempt to see if SCP-7000-A instances could accurately predict someone&#39;s personal information, thus proving that SCP-7000&#39;s luck is not limited to events with computable probabilities.

The subjects chosen were Junior Researcher Cameron Nox and Agent Alice. They were asked to keep SCP-7000-1 and SCP-7000-2 respectively on them for 24 hours before testing commenced. They were both presented with three photos of three foundation members, two of them deceased and one of them still alive and retired, all taken in the same year. They were then asked to randomly guess information such as:
* Their birth year,
* Their death year (or whether they were deceased),
* Where they were born and where they died,
* What age they were when the pictures were taken,
* What their favorite animal was,
* What their favorite color was
The predictions were noted down and once again put through Delta-L to test for accuracy.

**Test 1, 12:30**
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Individual 1:** Photo was of deceased researcher Sofia Semenov. Born in 1956 in ████, Russia, and died in 2004, in Glasgow, UK. Picture was taken in 2001, while she was at the age of 46, a few years before she died in a car accident.  Her favorite animals were leopards, and her favorite color was red.

**Recorded Answers:**
