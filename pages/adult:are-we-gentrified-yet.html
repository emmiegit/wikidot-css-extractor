Hey, Critic. Sure you heard, but the Menagerie&#39;s hosting a general exhibition on the 18th. I&#39;ve got most of the slots filled, but I still need about four or five more acts last minute before I feel comfortable attracting the kind of crowd I need right now.

Three things I want to mention:
# MC&amp;D are actively gentrifying the BackDoor.
# The Menagerie&#39;s union-owned.
# My two biggest sponsors, in art //and// money, were the KoH Collective and Olney.

Do the math.

Relax, James, relax. The Menagerie&#39;s gonna live if I gotta say in it.

Look, you have a show coming up, right? Let me loan you my private collection for one, and for two, U of SoHo loves the place. I&#39;ll put out an open call, see if they can&#39;t whip something up for the exhibit. Don&#39;t feel like this is gonna be the end of the world, that&#39;s the Jailers&#39; jobs.

Project Proposal 2018-59: I Heart My Prophet
[[/div]]
**Title:** //I Heart My Prophet// by //Hansarp//

**Material Requirements:**
Custom-made molding of Chief Foreman Robert Bumaro (already in my possession)
15 gallons of chocolate
A refrigerator

**Intent:** Love is a strange emotion, expressed in a myriad of forms.

As a devout Mekhanite, I have often been told that I am beloved by my prophet, and I have often told others that I love my prophet. I know this to be true: I love Robert Bumaro and he loves me, for through his grace and his guidance towards MEKHANE I am able to live out my blessed life as it is.

Many of the devout would argue that the ultimate expression of love is sex. It&#39;s the culmination of a partnership coming together to create something greater than the sum of its parts. It&#39;s two people who love each other committing an act of love, and there&#39;s nothing more beautiful than that.

**Abstract:** I am going to fellate the anatomically correct chocolate Robert Bumaro as a display of my love and passion not just towards him, but towards MEKHANE.

Alright, one, don&#39;t cite that creepy minotaur at me. //That// was all Tamlin.

Two, what you&#39;re suggesting I bill is akin to Mekhanite sacrilege. Need I remind the BackDoor homes about as many Mekhanites as NYC homes Jews? At least Judaism lacks Mitzvah regarding //welding a cannon to one&#39;s arm//.

Three, this is all disregarding the overly sexual nature of the piece in question. I don&#39;t care what Hansarp does in his spare time, but while he&#39;s in the Menagerie, he will be sucking exactly __zero__ cocks, whether hiding in the bathroom or //on the exhibit floor//. 

I am //not// putting this in the itinerary.

Are you missing the part where a madman wants to suck Bumaro&#39;s cock? In //my// Menagerie? You are turning my exhibit into exhibitionism!

Most of my invitations were already sent out. You have that list! Riddle me this, Critic: did you see a single Adytum&#39;s Lodge moron? Any one of the House of Spades goons? Did I headline, subtitle, byline, backpage, Sunday funny a single bit of lawyer-bait? No! Because the Menagerie can&#39;t afford that, because it doesn&#39;t //want// that.

Look, everything else so far&#39;s gold. I don&#39;t know how you got that kinda talent, and frankly I don&#39;t care. But know that as long as I&#39;m in charge, Bumaro&#39;s cock remains unsucked. Capiche?

Hello.

I have to say I&#39;m disappointed in the Menagerie. The world of art is no stranger to controversy; it is, additionally, no stranger to //fake// controversy. I find it ludicrous that a simple display of faith (one I might add appears predominantly in the BackDoor), no matter how lurid it may appear on text, would prompt such a rash decision.

I am thus issuing an ultimatum: reinstate //I Heart My Prophet// in the exhibition itinerary, or remove my works from the Menagerie in their entirety.

Sincerely,

Hi there!

As one of the oldest pizza establishments in the BackDoor, we&#39;re proud to see someone taking a stand against vulgarity for vulgarity&#39;s sake. The BackDoor is, after all, the culture capital of the anomalous world; if our standards degenerate, so does our standing.

We are therefore offering the Menagerie&#39;s upcoming exhibition extensive catering services, free of charge. It&#39;s the least we can do to show our thanks, and hopefully make up for the Union boycotts. Of course, we&#39;ll need access to some of the backrooms, but it&#39;ll be worth it for the level of service we provide.

**Date:** February 8th, 2018 at 11:59:59

Greetings,

On 02/05/2018, records indicate that //I Heart My Prophet//, a performance artpiece by one Mxr. Hansarp, was pulled from the Menagerie&#39;s upcoming exhibition. Following its removal, the general public at-large condemned the move; as the largest Mekhanite civil rights group in the Linuxsphere, the Mekhanite Self-Advocacy Network was thus obligated to respond to the event in question.

The MSAN has reviewed the case at large, and has come to the following conclusion:

This email is to inform you that you have been nominated for condemnation by the MSAN, following the arbitrary censorship of Mxr. Hansarp&#39;s act of self-expression. The MSAN accepts that //I Heart My Prophet//&#39;s core content might have been risque; however, it is the opinion of the MSAN the performance itself would be no more obscene than pieces such as //Quin preu és la virtut?// and //The Book of Tamlin//, both of which had been exhibited in the past by the Menagerie. It is therefore the conclusion of the MSAN that the removal of Mxr. Hansarp&#39;s piece was motivated primarily by mekhanophobic intentions.

Should you choose to reinstate //I Heart My Prophet// in the exhibition itinerary, condemnation proceedings will cease. It is the opinion of Reverend Technician Pandora Ellis that this is the preferred option in regards to the financial future of the Menagerie.

We hope to hear from you soon.

Right so, first of all sorry for trying to save the Menagerie from mediocrity. Second, I&#39;ve talked a lot of people on this, so bear with me:

Hansarp&#39;s willing to compromise; Mekhanites hate making enemies, you know how it goes. Basically instead of using a chocolate Bumaro, he uses Fauxcolate (kosher Mekhanite &#34;chocolate&#34; made from synthetics like oil) to craft the likeness of Mekhane, then polishes off //that//. I&#39;ve spoken to people from all three of the main branches, and it&#39;s completely kosher. It&#39;s even in line with the Orthodox thing about &#34;Divine Submission&#34;. Whaddya say?

Hey, this is Zend Kivelä! The Critic might&#39;ve told you about me.

I heard you were looking for help regarding the mess revolving around that one Mekh&#39;s piece. Personally I thought it was hilarious, but I guess other people can&#39;t appreciate a good piece of sacrilege when they see it.

I&#39;m proposing an alternative, complete with a way out. See, I&#39;m an up and coming artist. I&#39;m also an unapologetic Nälkän. It would make sense that, if you were trying to promote the little guy, you&#39;d exclude the kinds of people who wouldn&#39;t take well to xeir leanings. No harm, no foul, just... it&#39;s me or him, and he&#39;s got enough awards already.

I&#39;ve actually got a piece ready! It&#39;s a fleshcraft so I //do// need to feed it now and then, and I&#39;ll also probably need the +18 room you had reserved for Hansarp&#39;s, but //Ion Tames The Scarlet Archon// is sure to be a hit (don&#39;t ask me how much research I had to do on squid penises lmao)!

Critic tells me you already pre-approved this, so I&#39;ll spare you the abstract. Thanks in advance! :D

Yesterday I woke up, put on my suit, and went to the show I spent weeks organizing. This show had to **__//BE//__** perfect, and I wish with all my heart there was a way to emphasize that &#34;be&#34; more. I had to have the perfect line-up, with the perfect crowd, and everything had to run absolutely perfectly.

So let&#39;s flash back to one week prior.

Let me set the scene: just, say, five days prior, my mentor, the teacher I trusted most in the whole goddamn world, the //absolute authority// on East Coast anart, snuck a story into the TTTB about how I pulled a //vulgar sex act// from an itinerary //that never included it in the first place//, and somehow that was a bad thing. I became the knuckle-dragging moral panic bogeyman over fake news. For five //excruciating days//, I was the most hated man in America. It was as if Karl Marx lived in a nation of McCarthies, and he had just bombed a bus of mixed Vietnamese-Korean orphans of the incorrect latitude.

I would have lived //one hundred// of those days than experience //another singular second// of the week that followed the &#34;&#34;&#34;re&#34;&#34;&#34;incorporation of Hansarp&#39;s living obscenity into my perfect show.

Do you know how many people pulled out over your libelous garbage? Me neither. I stopped counting once it hit the double digits. Do you know how many pulled back in when I let myself sully my perfect show? __All of them__. One //hundred// percent. This was all they cared about. Do you know how it feels to know your star artists, your past and present peers care less about you than some cum-brained dullard?

I can&#39;t even hate him. When I called him up to tell him I&#39;d surrendered, I was finished, he didn&#39;t even care. I was not admonished, chastised, nor was I praised. He thanked me and hung up.

Fate wouldn&#39;t even dignify me with righteous anger.

For seven days, I didn&#39;t leave my apartment. I cried, screamed, lied perfectly still with a weight in my stomach; like something had pumped lead into my appendix until it burst. But I never left. How could I ever show my face again? I sold out. I failed you and I failed Melanie. I wasn&#39;t Cool.

As I&#39;m typing this, I look to my fingers. These are the fingers of a fraud, a hack, a garbage human. Can I still ask, with a straight face, if I&#39;m Cool Yet, knowing the answer will never be affirmative? When I punch the dirty bathroom mirror, am I still fighting the reflection of a man?

I don&#39;t even know if I still grieve for the ideal, unblemished past that could have been. I just want to feel genuine again.

So let&#39;s get back to the not-so-distant past of yesterday. I vomited twice, thinking of the show. Only a week before, the horror of getting pasted by Mekhanite cannon fire felt so viscerally real, but now, now it wasn&#39;t even horror: it was the ideal. Every minute instant was colored by the desire to be reduced to fine cinders on the way to that rotten show. If I had disintegrated in a single, joyous second, that would have been enough.

You can&#39;t know what it felt like, walking inside. Seeing the years of my hard work, everything in perfect working order, sandwiching the absolute most attractive, most //repugnantly beautiful// depiction of the Broken God ever crafted of synthetic chocolate. You want to know what wasn&#39;t Broken, Critic? Take a guess.

I&#39;ll give you a hint: //Ten. Whole. Inches//.

I need to reiterate: it was //beautiful//. //Divine//. In that horrid span of time it took my brain to register the Gnosis and its glorious stick-shift, it was as if the air had been stolen from my lungs by a fey vacuum. I knew then that Hansarp had been genuine, completely and utterly genuine: this was devotion at its purest, a magnum opus fueled by love in less than a fortnight. In that brief, intoxicating wet-nightmare, even //I// wanted to drop to my knees in reverence and suck off the Broken One.

Can I still call myself The Curator? I feel as a ghost, an empty imprint of a broken man blown away by a divine wind.

I can&#39;t remember much between then and The Main Show. Lindholm&#39;s botany was beautiful as usual, Zapata played the violin with inhuman grace to an applause of a dozen dead tenants past, Amador and Burg&#39;s performance... perhaps in another life, it&#39;d have roused a righteous anger in me. Now, I can only say that I was faintly amused.

And then... then came //I Heart My Prophet//. Then came //Hansarp//.

All at once, as if a million black flies dove from the vents to skin me alive, to strip me of my muscles until only a skeleton remained, I simultaneously stood stunned in silence and, deep in the fractured recesses of my psyche, screamed with a searing, seething fury. I knew then I could stop it, tackle the wretched louse as he sauntered towards that chocolate Mekhane, stop this farce once and for all... if only my feet hadn&#39;t been weighted down by the unseen force of my compounded despair.

Hansarp began, and lord help me but I //watched//.

Silently, for that scant eternity, I looked on in a then-unimaginable horror. By some horrid force, some horrid //farce//, my attention remained firmly on that contemptible copper twink sucking his blackened heart out, the conductor to the Menagerie&#39;s ruin. His technique was impeccable, Critic. Take solace knowing that my ruin was performed with skill.

Then, Hansarp went off script.

I hesitate to recall the specifics; the imprint left in my mind is one of pathos, of the shapes and colors of Hansarp blending with Mekhane, who looked to be moving in time with its partner. &#34;You had to be there&#34;. I wish you were, instead of I.

When, finally, Hansarp took his bow, I checked my watch to find that my mental clock had been frozen in time, two hours short of the one on my wrist. I rubbed my eyes, and only then did I realize I had begun to cry at some indistinct point in the painfully recent past. Of beauty? Of sorrow? Of sheer existential despair? I don&#39;t think I care to know.

Did you know I forgot to disinvite Kivelä? Me neither. I have nothing to say of xeir piece: the effigy of Ion, deep in the effigy of the Scarlet King, might have once moved me, towards disgust or awe.

The Menagerie made bank and everyone loved it.

Fuck you.

-//The Curator//
