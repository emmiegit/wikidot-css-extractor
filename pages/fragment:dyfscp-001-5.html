+++ MISSION STATEMENT

On May 12th, 2588, the entity known as SCP-UBU invaded and pillaged human civilization for no other motivation than cruelty and selfish gratification.

Shortly thereafter, Project Beluga was founded as a joint effort between the Global Occult Coalition and the SCP Foundation for the purposes of UBU&#39;s destruction.

UBU is not merely a threat to human safety. He[[footnote]] **Emergency Correction:** {{ALL RIGHT LOOK I JUST STARTED CALLING UBU A &#34;HE&#34; AND IT STUCK AFTER A WHILE OKAY I AM AWARE HE&#39;S GENDER NEUTRAL VIS A VIS BEING AN ANOMALOUS PILE OF MONSTER FLESH OR WHATEVER BUT FOR FUCK&#39;S SAKE I&#39;VE BEEN AT THIS HOW LONG NOW??? JUST LET ME HAVE THIS}} [[/footnote]] is an affront to every positive and loving concept in the human consciousness. Rather than our lives, he seeks to destroy our quality of life to sate his own sick desires.

Think about it: The taste of ice cream. Playing with your dog. The way you felt after your first kiss.

//That is UBU&#39;s sworn enemy.//

No fate is too cruel for him. No hatred is strong enough.

When Project Beluga&#39;s charter was signed, 592 GOC officers and Foundation staff were present at the ceremony. Our troops numbered in the hundreds of thousands.

I, Dr. Laurence Michaud, am the only surviving member - and always will be. What I lack in numbers is compensated thousandfold by my weapons, my mind, my replicated bodies, and aeons of experience.

The following record serves one purpose alone: that once justice has been brought to UBU, humans in the shining and golden UBU-free future will understand that one person can accomplish through the power of hard science and raw emotion entwined in a perfect and indestructible braid.

+++ ...and while we&#39;re at it, you&#39;re very welcome.

[[div style=&#34;border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f7ffff; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;&#34;]]
++ Cycle 1: &#34;Initial&#34;

**Description:** (See Previous Documentation)

**Activation Point:** 2/14/3030 CE

**Notes:** Initial discovery and usage of SCP-001.
[[/div]]

------

[[div style=&#34;border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f7ffff; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;&#34;]]
++ Cycle 2: &#34;Cooperation&#34;

**Description:** First year spent on perfecting the use of SCP-YEZ to achieve the spread-consciousness effect. The next 12,000 years focused on the expansion of the base Site-Beluga[[footnote]] Located within SCP-FNA, which itself is inside SCP-001. [[/footnote]], the creation of usable replicates for Dr. Michaud through the use of the onsite Hominid Replicators, clandestine collection of resources, and observation for any historical factors that would have led to the appearance of SCP-UBU. Remainder spent on securing Foundation resources &amp; possible assistance.

**Activation Point:** 4/14/1995 CE

**Notes:** The SCP Foundation can no longer be trusted. (Best not to risk it with the GOC; that would be suicidal.)
[[/div]]

[[div style=&#34;border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f7ffff; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;&#34;]]
++ Cycle 3: &#34;Mousetrap&#34;

**Description:** Ownership of Kangaatsiaq, Greenland secured through a Project Beluga civilian front. Civilian population forcibly evacuated. Century prior to UBU appearance spent in the construction of BELUGA-1 in the epicenter of UBU&#39;s appearance.

BELUGA-1 consists of the following:

* 100 high-yield nuclear weapons.
* Heat-amplification runes copied from SCP-NSF.
* A targeting beacon for SCP-DAG.
* Five antimatter-gathering pods from SCP-HNM.

BELUGA-1 detonated on schedule on 5/12/2588 at 0533 GMT.

**Activation Point:** 9/1/2588 CE

**Notes:** SCP-UBU unharmed. Rampages proceeded similarly to Cycle 1, save for the additional environmental threat posed by the slowly expanding lake of magma in Greenland.

++ Cycle 4: &#34;Competition&#34;

**Description:** Greater scope of clandestine control gained over the Foundation &amp; Global Occult Coalition via the use of replicates. 25 years prior to UBU&#39;s scheduled arrival, [[[SCP-2803]]]-A was consulted via email.

&gt; **SCP-2803-A:** Sosososoo GOOT to am beeng do amrucan BUSNUS witf MESTERIUS forain invoster such as youselfl, mr micho. Or prhaps I shud say MON SEEUR micho? haha is lil joek.
&gt; 
&gt; **Michaud:** They weren&#39;t kidding when they said you had a sense of humor! But here&#39;s the thing, Mr. Gock: I&#39;ve got a bit of inside information on the future of the consumer electronics market, if you&#39;d like to hear -- that is, unless you wouldn&#39;t wanna get your nose dirty with the feds?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2803-A:** OOOOOOO YEES YEES i woud VERY MUSH liking do ing teh insidder tradigs hahaha ents jusderfy the meens amirite?? Ther is no contsern abt my nos becum durty on accont of -- waaaate foar it -- i ams verry larg pial of fletsh and donut haf a nos! SUKK IT, GOVARMET REGERLATIONS!
&gt; 
&gt; **Michaud:** Attaboy! Well, word on the street is: in about 25 years, something&#39;s gonna come up in Greenland that&#39;s gonna tank the global economy.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2803-A:** nOO NOT ECOMMONY
&gt; 
&gt; **Michaud:** There&#39;s more. Some //Eastern// joker by the name of UBU wants to put a serious dent into consumer electronics in particular. If you&#39;ve got any future projects slated for your tentpole IPs like [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2219 Porridge] or [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2527 Massy], you&#39;d better get &#39;em done before 2588 -- because after that, people are gonna start spending their video game dollars on disaster relief!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2803-A:** OH GREEF
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2803-A:** TIS IS AN OUTRAG
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2803-A:** TOTLEIGHSOFT IS NAT CAPPABLE OF DISATSER RELEEF
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2803-A:** TOTLEIGHSOFT PRODOOSES HI-QUALTY DISATSERS NOT RELEEFS THEM
&gt; 
&gt; **Michaud:** But, all is not lost. I&#39;ve heard tell from those Foundation creeps that you have a unique skillset that could put this UBU guy in his place. Something about... obliterating?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2803-A:** oohhoHOHOhoohOHoHhOh
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2803-A:** wel
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2803-A:** asa matter ov fac...

A year prior to UBU&#39;s arrival, SCP-2803-A announced a &#34;strateejik merger&#34; with &#34;larg crabb thng corporashin&#34; and promptly attacked, parasitized, and fused with SCP-169. The resulting creature was 1.5 times SCP-169&#39;s size and had multiple heads.

Billions died overnight from collateral damage. I tried to stick around and observe the inevitable fight with UBU for anything that could at least make the bastard flinch. The fight lasted centuries, but no damage whatsoever was done to anyone on either side. UBU finally made the killing slap when it stopped being fun.

**Activation Point:** 1/4/2992 CE

**Notes:** Moving forward, it would be best not to fight through a third party.

++ Cycle 273: &#34;Spirited Away&#34;

**Description:** Increased the aperture from the BELUGA-94 project to teleport the entire continent of Greenland into another dimension after the UBU materialization event.

UBU and Greenland successfully disappeared on 5/12/2588 at 0534 GMT.

At 0539 GMT, a //second// UBU materialization event occurred in the exact same place. Rampage continued as normal.

**Activation Point:** 6/30/2588 CE

**Notes:** This, combined with the equally bizarre failures from Cycle 28, 57, 102-168, and 260 are causing unnecessary self-doubt. Considering modifying the central consciousness containment unit to identify any negativity directed toward the self and forcibly reroute it toward UBU.

++ Cycle 530: &#34;UBU destruction attempt #530&#34;

**Description:** Site-ASSEMBLY established in Cyprus in 10,485 BCE. Construction of the BELUGA-X unit was completed over the course of 3,000 years at Site-ASSEMBLY.

To achieve this, the Church of the Broken God was infiltrated and forcibly repurposed into the False Pretense Labor Division of Project Beluga. Sarkic cult activity goes unchecked throughout much of Eastern Europe as a result. Damage deemed acceptable.

BELUGA-X is a heavily armed construct based on the design of [[[SCP-2406]]]. The &#34;flesh-loosening&#34; harpoons from BELUGA-580 were reconfigured as BELUGA-X&#39;S primary weapon.

Shortly before the first encounter, Replicate-5818, BELUGA-X&#39;s pilot, was chosen as Majority Consciousness Holder.

BELUGA-X was deployed on the outskirts of Kangaatsiaq approximately ten minutes after the UBU Materialization Event...

&gt; //(BELUGA-X examines the wreckage of the city.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Replicate-5818:** Target not sighted. Switching to exterior comms.
&gt; 
&gt; **BELUGA-X:** SCP-UBU. This planet is under the protection of Project Beluga. We know why you have attempted to invade, and for this, you must -
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-UBU:** //(Unintelligible)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Replicate-5818:** Triangulating... two klicks southeast. Approaching.
&gt; 
&gt; **BELUGA-X:** Show yourself!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-UBU:** Meescho?
&gt; 
&gt; (//BELUGA-X freezes.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **BELUGA-X:** ...no.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-UBU:** MEESCHO! //Meescho-Meescho-Meescho!//
&gt; 
&gt; **BELUGA-X:** //I did NOT tell you my name! How the hell do you -//
&gt; 
&gt; //(UBU whistles the bathtime song. His skill with whistling has improved.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **BELUGA-X:** ...it&#39;s you. You&#39;re the original one. You&#39;ve... //how?!//
&gt; 
&gt; //(Ubu giggles hysterically.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **BELUGA-X:** //How did you survive?! HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN FOLLOWING ME?!//
&gt; 
&gt; //(BELUGA-X charges for UBU&#39;s location. Mid-charge, the unit&#39;s right leg makes contact with a large pile of UBU dung. The entire BELUGA-X unit loses its footing and collapses.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Replicate-5818:** //(Berserk shrieking.)//
&gt; 
&gt; //(Repeated thumping noises against the BELUGA-X cockpit. UBU howls.)//

**Activation Point:** 5/12/2588 CE

**Notes:** no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
