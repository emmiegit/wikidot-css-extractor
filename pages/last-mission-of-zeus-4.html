**Recovery Log Transcript**
**Date**: ██/██/████
**Recovery Team**: Mobile Task Force Zeus-4 &#34;Dire Thunder&#34; 
**Subject**: Site-22
**Team Lead**: Alpha
**Team Members**: Omega, Gamma, Delta
**Abstract**: After Site-22 suffered several containment breaches, MTF Zeus-4 were sent in to find and retrieve critical data and, if possible, extract any remaining personnel before the onsite nuke was detonated. However, the mission was a failure, and the team was prevented from even entering the site. Included below is their final transmission before disbanding.

&gt; **Deployment Manager aka SiteCommand:** Members of MTF Zeus-4 check in.
&gt; 
&gt; **Alpha:** Alpha checking in, over. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Gamma:** Gamma checking in, over. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Omega:** Gamma, please be advised that we should be doing this in numerical order, over.
&gt; 
&gt; **Gamma:** Command, please advise Omega that it really doesn&#39;t matter in what order we check in, over.
&gt; 
&gt; **SiteCommand:** Jeremy, it really doesn&#39;t matter what order you guys sound off in. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Omega:** Command, please advise as to the identity of this &#34;Jeremy&#34; individual. I am Agent-
&gt; 
&gt; //Omega can be heard mimicking the sound of static.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Omega:** -of MTF Zeus-4, decorated hero of-
&gt; 
&gt; **Alpha:** Thank you, Omega, we can see that your comms are working. Team should continue to check in, over. 
&gt; 
&gt; //Silence for five seconds.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Command:** Luke, this is you. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Oh, okay! Sorry guys. My name is Luke, this is my first time at the table, and-
&gt; 
&gt; **Omega:** Delta, please simply check your comm system and refrain from giving out classified information such as your name, over.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** What? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Alpha:** Just say you&#39;re checking in, and follow it with the word &#39;over&#39; so we know we got the end of your transmission.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** This is Luke checking in. 
&gt; 
&gt; //Another awkward pause.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Alpha:** Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Right! Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **Alpha:** Okay, let&#39;s get a move on. Permission to proceed, Command, over.
&gt; 
&gt; **Command:** Permission granted, Alpha.  Here&#39;s the situation: following numerous containment breaches from Euclid- and Keter-class SCPs, Site-22 has been compromised. The on-site nuke is set to go off in t-minus thirty minutes, vaporizing everything within a three kilometer radius. Before that happens, O5-7 has authorized one final mission to go inside to retrieve Dr. Redacted and escort her safely to-
&gt; 
&gt; **Omega:** Please clarify, Command. I&#39;m unfamiliar with any personnel at any site under the name &#39;Dr. Redacted&#39;, over. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Command:** That&#39;s what it says in the file, Omega. I&#39;m just reading you the briefing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Omega:** I&#39;m just not sure that&#39;s the doctor&#39;s actual name, Command. Over. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Alpha:** Objection noted, Omega. Please allow Command to continue the brief, over. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Gamma:** Afraid I&#39;m gonna have to side with Omega on this one, Cap, dirty as it feels. Hearing someone referred to as &#39;Dr. Redacted&#39; just doesn&#39;t sound right. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** You forgot to say &#39;over&#39;, Clair.
&gt; 
&gt; //Sound of Gamma sighing heavily through her nose.// 
&gt; 
&gt; **Gamma:** Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Actually, now that I think of it, how are we supposed to recover this doctor if we&#39;re not allowed to know her name? Are we supposed to just grab the first living person we run into? Is she the only female doctor working at this site? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Alpha:** Newbie brings up a good point, Command. We&#39;ll need a way to identify the target if we stand any chance of a successful extraction. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Command:** Fine. Just let me find something you can work with and declassify it.
&gt; 
&gt; //Radio silence. Thirteen seconds later, the sound of rustling papers can be heard. Alpha clears his throat.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Command:** Doctor Allison Taylor can be identified by the wine-colored birthmark on her neck. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Gamma**: And probably also by a nametag that reads &#39;Dr. Alison Taylor&#39;. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta**: Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **Alpha**: Is that the entirety of the briefing, over? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Command**: That&#39;s all the relevant bits. You&#39;re to enter Site-22 and retrieve Dr. Taylor, as well as any information and other survivors you might encounter.
&gt; 
&gt; **Omega**: Any information on what skips we can expect to encounter at Site-22, over? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Alpha**: We&#39;ve got a list of all the entities contained within the site and their SCP designations. Be advised that this may not include unauthorized transfers. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Command**: Come on, give me a break. I promised not to pull the &#39;unauthorized transfer&#39; thing on you guys again, and I meant it. I&#39;m sticking to the containment list you have access to, and that&#39;s it. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Gamma**: Should be fair enough, as long as none of us take the opportunity to metagame. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta**: What does that mean, over? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Gamma**: It means googling the skips in question and building your character with a ton of bullshit feats and equipment specifically designed to show the rest of us up and ruin the fun. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Omega:** I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re hinting at, Gamma. Also don&#39;t forget to follow each transmission with the word &#39;over&#39;, over.
&gt; 
&gt; **Gamma:** Goddammit, Jeremy, we&#39;re sitting three feet away from each other! You can drop the &#39;over&#39; thing! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Omega:** Gamma, please be advised that the Foundation uses the metric sys-
&gt; 
&gt; //Loud thumping noises can be heard alongside the scratching of a chair against carpet. Unintelligible arguing between Gamma and Omega ensues, and Gamma&#39;s voice grows quieter before disappearing. Omega&#39;s voice can be heard following a similar pattern.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta**: Clair? Jeremy? Are you coming back, over? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Alpha**: I think that&#39;s a wash, newbie. Better luck next time. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Command**: We&#39;ll try again next week. Hopefully then we&#39;ll be able to get past the mission briefing and actually start playing. Thanks for coming over anyway. There&#39;s still pizza on the dryer if you want some. 
&gt; 
&gt; //More chairs can be heard shuffling, then muffled conversation between Alpha, Delta, and Command. At this point, audio cuts out entirely.//</textarea></pre>
