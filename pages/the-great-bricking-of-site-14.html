Olivia sighs, plucks a tissue, then cleans off enough extinguisher foam to shave with. She sits back and takes a moment to look over her office. Even as Assistant Director, her office was not much more lavish than those outside. In the squeak of the rusting ceiling fan, atop her plastic IKEA chair, Olivia silently deplored how far the Telecommunications Monitoring Office had fallen. After a while, she sat forward in her chair and edited her email slightly.

A computer virus is specifically a program that replicates its code across machines. Too little is known about the issue to know if this is indeed how it functions, so I implore you call it a &#34;software bug&#34;.

Mr. Darlingson,

I have recently become aware of your tampering with a Mr. Terring&#39;s laptop in order to host video game programs. This is punishable via wage cut. Due to a loophole in policy, severance pay can be classified as wage. As such, your severance pay has been halved.

Yours faithfully,
Assistant Director Olivia Deaver.
