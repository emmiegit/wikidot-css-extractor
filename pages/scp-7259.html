**Item #:** SCP-7259

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7259 is to be kept locked in a standardized containment unit at Site-██. The playing of SCP-7259 is strictly prohibited with no exceptions. 

**Description:** SCP-7259 is a VHS tape with the 1987 romantic-comedy film //Some Kind of Wonderful// by John Hughes recorded onto it.

Upon being played, numerous hostile entities, known collectively as SCP-7259-1, will begin spontaneously manifesting around the source of the playback. This manifestation will continue, with the radius around which the SCP-7259-1 entities can appear in growing rapidly wider, unless SCP-7259 is able to be turned off. When turned off, all SCP-7259-1 entities will immediately disappear. Simply waiting for SCP-7259 to complete it&#39;s runtime is ineffective, seeing as the film automatically restarts itself upon reaching the end.

SCP-7259-1 entities resemble that of the three (3) main characters of the //Some Kind of Wonderful// film, with those characters being Keith, Watts, and Amanda Jones, respectively. Despite their similarities in physical traits and attire, SCP-7259-1 entities possess that of severe violent and animalistic mannerisms, and lack any semblance of human intelligence, contrasting greatly with that of their original character counterparts. It is worth noting that SCP-7259-1 entities always have a solemn expression on their face, and are capable of limited speech, where they will randomly vocalize a quote from //Some Kind of Wonderful// that correlates with whichever character it is that they resemble.

Immediately after manifestation, SCP-7259-1 entities will attempt to quickly attack and kill anyone within their immediate vicinity with their teeth, nails, and any accessories they have on them capable of inflicting wounds. Though their attack methods vary, they always consist of that of extreme and brutal violence.

**Addendum 7259.1: Discovery:** SCP-7259 was discovered during an investigation regarding that of a supposed home invasion in Denver, Colorado, where a family of five (5), the Sittersons, were attacked in their suburban home by multiple violent individuals during their weekly family movie night. Though there were no casualties, all five (5) members of the Sitterson family were wounded during the incident, with their injuries ranging from mild to moderate in severity. The family also expressed that of having been extremely &#34;shaken up&#34; by the incident. 

Upon being interviewed, it became clear that what the Sittersons believed to be a &#34;home invasion by multiple violent individuals&#34; was actually that of SCP-7259-1 entities manifesting in and around the Sitterson residence and attacking the family due to SCP-7259 being played. How SCP-7259 came into the possession of the Sitterson family is unclear.

= **INTERVIEW LOG**
----
**DATE:** 9/14/2022
**INTERVIEWER:** Dr. Ridley
**INTERVIEWED:** James and Macy Sitterson 
----

**[**BEGIN LOG**]**

**Dr. Ridley:** Mr. Sitterson. Mrs. Sitterson. 

**James Sitterson:** Please, call me James. That whole &#34;mister&#34; crap makes me feel old. I may be approaching the big five-oh, but I&#39;m not there yet!

**Dr. Ridley:** Alright then. James. What can you tell me about the incident? Start from the very beginning, please.

**James Sitterson:** The very beginning? Well, let&#39;s see... It was a Friday night, and the kids were all arguing about which movie they wanted to watch. Duncan wanted an //Indiana Jones// movie, Emma wanted some romance movie, and little Kyle...?

**[**James Sitterson lets out a small, singular chuckle.**]**

**James Sitterson:** ...Well of course he wanted to watch //Cars// for the umpteenth time.

**Macy Sitterson:** Fridays are our movie nights, you see. It&#39;s a little family tradition. Every Friday night, we all sit down and watch a movie together. Usually we let the kids choose the movie, but recently, for the past few weeks, they&#39;ve been arguing more and more about which movie to watch.

**James Sitterson:** Yeah, so this time, we, uh, decided to intervene, and pick the movie. Y&#39;know, so we could get on with our night and so that the kids would stop arguing. So Macy and I, we went over to our movie cabinet where we have a lot of old movies from the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s and 2000&#39;s on VHS&#39;s and DVDs and whatnot. Yeah, I know. It&#39;s weird. I still use the old school stuff, and not those shitty streaming services or whatever. I dunno, it&#39;s just those stupid fuckin&#39; things make you pay for them every month, and then some of them don&#39;t even have the movie you wanna see on it half the time, like //Netflix//--.

**Dr. Ridley:** Mr. Sitterson. James. Sorry to interrupt, but may we stay on topic, please?

**James Sitterson:** Oh! Right! Right. Sorry.

**Dr. Ridley:** That&#39;s alright. So, you and your wife went over to your movie cabinet to pick out a movie, correct? What happened after that?

**James Sitterson:** That&#39;s when we got the movie. It was one of those teen romance John Hughes films from the 80&#39;s. //Some Kind of Wonderful//. That&#39;s what it was called. I got a VHS for it as a gift a while back, but I never really ever got around to watching it, which is weird seeing as I&#39;m a HUGE fucking John Hughes fan. Like seriously! I watch //Home Alone// almost religiously every year when Christmas comes around, I&#39;m an absolute sucker for //The Breakfast Club//, I&#39;m--I dunno. I just really like the guy&#39;s films.

**Macy Sitterson:** Yeah, that&#39;s true. So when we found the //Some Kind of Wonderful// movie in our movie cabinet, and James saw that it was a John Hughes movie, it was basically guaranteed that we were going to end up watching it that night.

**[**Dr. Ridely jots down some notes.**]**

**Dr. Ridley:** Okay, so you picked out the VHS tape, and then...?

**James Sitterson:** Well, we sat down in the living room with the kids, and started watching the movie.

**Dr. Ridley:** And is this when the incident began?

**[**James and Macy Sitterson become suddenly quiet. After a moment, Macy Sitterson speaks.**]**

**Macy Sitterson:** Yes. That&#39;s when it began.

**James Sitterson:** I left the living room for just a second to go make some popcorn for us all. Just a damn second! One second I&#39;m poppin&#39; popcorn in the kitchen microwave, and the next, I&#39;m running into the living room because I hear Emma screaming bloody fuckin&#39; murder at the top of her lungs!

**Macy Sitterson:** Emma was the first to see them. I don&#39;t know how the hell they got into our house, but somehow they did. And they kept coming, and coming, and coming! There were three of them! Then seven! Then ten! Twelve! Fifteen! Sixteen! Seventeen! Fucking twenty! They just kept coming!

**James Sitterson:** By the time I finally reached the living room, there were already like dozens of them in there. My family had backed up against the far wall of the room, but they were still coming at them! Looking at my family almost like a goddamn animal looks at it&#39;s prey before it jumps on it! I yelled at my wife to take the kids, and get outta the house, so Macy took them, and began running.

**Macy Sitterson:** We ran out into the kitchen. The--The kids and I, that is. James stayed in the living room to fight the fucks off. They were all over in the kitchen too, though! My God, there were so many! It was almost like our house had been targeted for some reason by a bunch of crazy fucking teens!

**Dr. Ridley:** Teens? You say your attackers were teenagers?

**James Sitterson:** Yep! All the guys breaking in, and I mean all of them, were wearing more or less the same outfits, and looked around late teens //maybe// early twenties in age.

**Dr. Ridley:** They were wearing the same outfits? Like matching uniforms? Or color coordinated attire? What do you mean by that?

**James Sitterson:** Um, well, I mean... God, I dunno. Not all of them were wearing the //exact// same thing. Some of them were, though. I saw a good amount of repeats of the same wardrobe present on a lot of them. And these clothes...They all made them look, uh... Jeez, I dunno how else to describe it then it made them all look painfully 80&#39;s! Like, I don&#39;t know of any teens nowadays who would dress like how these freaks did!
  
**[**James Sitterson pauses for a moment, biting his bottom lip in thought.**]**

**James Sitterson:** There was one other thing about how they looked, too. I--I&#39;m not sure though. It was dark after all, and we //had// just been watching that //Some Kind of Wonderful// movie, so that might&#39;ve had something to do with it, but... These teens? I could&#39;ve sworn they looked like the main characters in the movie! And not like cosplayers, or any crap like that. I mean they //actually// looked exactly like how the characters did!

**[**James Sitterson rubs his eyes, before laughing slightly to himself.**]**

**James Sitterson:** That&#39;s--Oh fuck, that can&#39;t be right, y&#39;know? Like I said, it was dark. We had just been watching that movie. I was fighting off a bunch of these goddamn kids who were trying to attack me! I must&#39;ve not been seeing things right, or something. My-My eyes were playing tricks on me, and all that crap.

**[**Dr. Ridley jots down notes.**]**

**Dr. Ridley:** Of course. Now, if you don&#39;t mind, I would like to go back to what you were saying, Mrs. Sitterson, about what happened with you and your children after your husband told you to run.

**Macy Sitterson:** Oh! Uh, y-yes! Sure thing. Let&#39;s see... We had ran into the kitchen, where there were tons more of those fucking intruders. One of them that was close to me backhanded me quite forcefully, causing me to fall to the floor and hit my head on the cabinet. Another one grabbed Kyle by the arm, digging their nails so deep into his skin that he started bleeding. Duncan tried to help him, but he got pushed to the ground, where two more of them started just kicking him, over and over again! By now, both Emma and Kyle were screaming and crying nonstop. Emma out of terror, and Kyle out of pain from the bastard fuck who was fucking digging into his fucking flesh!

**[**Macy Sitterson takes a long, shaky deep breath before continuing.**]**

**Macy Sitterson:** Then they went for Emma. One tackled her from behind, pinning her face first to the floor. It then began... It began biting her. Biting at her neck! I watched her, heard her scream as it ripped at her skin! Tearing her skin off! That&#39;s when I got up, grabbed a nearby knife on the countertop, and stabbed that fucking monster pinning her right in it&#39;s fucking neck! I think it must&#39;ve killed it, because it went limp, and fell off of Emma after that. I got Emma up, and had her put her hand to her neck to help stop the bleeding. I then used the knife to kill the fucker that has grabbed Kyle, and warded off the two that were kicking Duncan with it as well. Then, once I got all of my kids, I ran out of the house. Outside wasn&#39;t much better though, because they were out there, too. Not as many as there were inside, maybe like only about ten, or twelve or so. But more were rapidly coming out from the darkness, almost like they were appearing right out of thin air! But then, suddenly, they were just... Gone.

**Dr. Ridley:** Gone?

**Macy Sitterson:** Yeah. Gone. They were just gone. I dunno what the hell happened, but one second they were there, and then the next...

**James Sitterson:** That happened with the ones inside, too. I was fighting with a bunch of them in the living room. I cracked a lamp over the head of one, and then it said some gibberish crap about it being better to swallow blood than pride, or maybe it was the other way around--It doesn&#39;t really matter. The point is, this asshole was talking gibberish, then threw me backwards across the room, and onto this little table we have underneath our TV where we keep our VHS and DVD players, along with the Xbox and stuff for the kids. And like, I must&#39;ve blacked out or something, because when I got up, the intruders were completely gone. No sign of them anywhere. The only evidence that they were ever there was the busted stuff in the living room like the VHS player, and the table, and the lamp, and, of course, the fucking wounds on my family.

**Dr. Ridley:** I see... And is that how the incident concluded?

**James Sitterson:** Pretty much.

**Dr. Ridley:** Okay. Very well. That just about concludes this interview then. However, before you go, I would like to ask you one more question, if you don&#39;t mind.

**James Sitterson:** Uh, sure. What is it?

**Dr. Ridley:** You mentioned earlier that somebody gave you the //Some Kind of Wonderful// film as a present, yes?

**James Sitterson:** Yeah, that&#39;s correct.

**Dr. Ridley:** Can you, by any chance, recall who gave the film to you, and why?

**James Sitterson:** Well, as to why they gave me the film, it&#39;s probably because they knew I was a big John Hughes fan. Who gave it to me, though, I don&#39;t exactly remember. I think it could&#39;ve been my brother, but I&#39;m not sure...

**Macy Sitterson:** James? That can&#39;t be right.

**James Sitterson:** What? Why not?

**Macy Sitterson:** Because you don&#39;t have a brother.
