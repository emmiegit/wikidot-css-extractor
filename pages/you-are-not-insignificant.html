Last week, we lost Researcher Kermode. He hung himself in his office. Didn&#39;t even leave a note explaining why. Everyone thinks he broke under stress.

Well, this week, we&#39;re losing me. And I think you all deserve an explanation as to why.

I was working with Kermode on a few projects. We dug up a few... ugly things. Who could have guessed that manuscript would reveal the Foundation going back //that// far? Or that the fortune teller would show us the possibility of it existing far, far into the future, desperately trying to keep the human race safe even after the apocalypse. Hell, I&#39;ll admit I was shaken when we stumbled into the containment chambers even the O5s didn&#39;t know about.

Kermode killed himself because in light of all of that, all of those grand achievements that the Foundation&#39;s done and will do, he felt like nothing. Just a bug crawling across the surface of the planet, searching for a non-existent meaning. At the time, I didn&#39;t really get what had shaken him up so badly. Still didn&#39;t for the past week or so. But his death got me thinking.

I still don&#39;t see exactly what&#39;s so horrifying about being insignificant; it&#39;s something every living creature has to deal with. But our work, and the time I&#39;ve had to think since his death, that&#39;s brought me to another conclusion. I&#39;m //not// insignificant.

I work for the Foundation. Even if I&#39;m only a single unit, I&#39;m still a unit that&#39;s working with a million others, working behind the scenes to keep the world safe from impending disaster. We&#39;re all part of one great, big machine, designed specifically to keep everyone safe. We here aren&#39;t insignificant; we&#39;re the most important people on the planet.

And that terrifies me.

Has anyone really ever realized how many people we protect? How many people whose simple existence relies on us not screwing up? There&#39;s seven billion individual walking, thinking, innocent people out there who could die the very instant we make a mistake. Hell, in a few cases, a sizable chunk of the universe is relying on us to play our cards just right. Every last little thing is reliant on //us//, and we&#39;re continually one bad move away from ending it all.

And even if we don&#39;t screw up, look at all these new threats materializing. We&#39;ve brought in close to a thousand new objects this year. What was the average beforehand? Twenty? Thirty? Something big is happening. The sheer amount of anomalies popping up tells me that we&#39;ll be needing to apply more and more pressure to the world soon. Tightening our defenses, closing up gaps, making every thing safer and safer, always applying more pressure.

We&#39;re the protectors of the world. We&#39;ve got the whole planet in our hands, cupping it with a light squeeze to keep it safe. What happens on the day we squeeze a little too hard, and everything implodes?

I can&#39;t be a part of that. I need to get out, right now. Even the time it would take to apply for an amnestic is too long to live with the knowledge that our only two options are utter failure and destructive success. So that&#39;s why I&#39;m relying on a piece of lead in my brain.

I&#39;ve got to go now.

Goodbye.</textarea></pre>
