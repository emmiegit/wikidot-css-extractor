You&#39;ve had this dream before, you know. Maybe only the once, or maybe often. You&#39;re falling through nothingness. In the distance, there&#39;s music. You can never place it, but it&#39;s always there. One of these days, you think, you&#39;ll head out into that darkness. Figure out where it&#39;s coming from. 

It&#39;s never the same song exactly, but... similar. Repeating patterns, cycling over and under, shifting into new combinations but always resolving. Always coming back home. You like it. It&#39;s... simple.

You think you remember other people here. Maybe... long ago? You see the remnants of them around you. Their houses, their cars, their things. Corner stores, libraries, gas stations. But there isn&#39;t anyone anymore. It&#39;s just you.

You feel like you used to be someone, you know? Like you had a purpose. Now you just wander these streets. In the distance, you notice that the music is fading. Getting farther away maybe. You don&#39;t think to chase it this time. If it had been important, you would have done it already, right? That&#39;s what you keep telling yourself anyway.

You turn a corner, and then another, and then another, trying to remember why it was you came here. Where you were going. You never quite get there though. It&#39;s like thinking through fog. Fighting just to keep putting one foot in front of the other.

How long have you been here? Do you even know?

Does it even matter?

You suppose it doesn&#39;t.

You&#39;re at the edge of town now. There&#39;s nothing out there but the dark expanse of the nothingness. Of the unknown. You think again about the music. About how you&#39;ve always wondered where it was coming from. You could head out now. There&#39;s still time before you wake up. You look out into the nothingness.

Then you turn, and head back into the town.
