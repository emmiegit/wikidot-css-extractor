Lemme tell you about reality benders.

First off, we like t&#39;call &#39;em Bixbies.  Why?  One, in case somebody accidentally says somethin&#39; in front of a civilian, it don&#39;t tip &#39;em off.  Two, if yer talking //to// a reality bender, they might not know all they can do, an&#39; you don&#39;t wanna give &#39;em any ideas.

These fuckers are dangerous.  You see one, you don&#39;t engage unless you absolutely have to.  If you do have to, be polite, try t&#39;think happy thoughts, maybe you&#39;ll have a good day.  Probably not.  Whenever you can, let the experts deal with &#39;em.

We don&#39;t try containin&#39; them, most of the time.  Yeah, Foundation don&#39;t usually work that way, but we like t&#39;have a world to live in.  So on this point, we usually agree with the GOC.  Better they&#39;re gone.  

Okay, so, you&#39;re fightin&#39; somebody who can do pretty much anything.  How d&#39;you stop &#39;em?  Well, first off, they can&#39;t do anything they ain&#39;t thought of.  Like, they can maybe all read minds.  But if they ain&#39;t thought about doin&#39; it, don&#39;t know they can, then they&#39;re not gonna try it.  Remember, they&#39;re not smarter&#39;n you.  They may be able to do things different, might know things you don&#39;t, but they&#39;re not smarter.

Second, they gotta concentrate.  We had one asshole, he decided he was gonna know about everybody watchin&#39; him.  Fucker killed twenty of us before we just had a bunch of us rush him.  Couldn&#39;t get all of &#39;us, y&#39;know?

Which kinds of Bixbies are worst?  Depends how you mean.  For my money, it&#39;s a kid Bixby.  Almost always ends with a bullet.  Sniper can usually take &#39;em out pretty easy.  But actually killin&#39; &#39;em?  You show me a guy who just shot a three-year-old, I show you somebody with some damage upstairs.  There are worse things you&#39;ll do for the Foundation, but not a lot.

Now, hardest to take down?  Usually, somebody around late teens, early twenties.  Much younger, they don&#39;t know enough to do as much harm.  Older&#39;n that, they don&#39;t got much flexibility in their thinkin&#39; to try anything real out there.  Late teens, early twenties, they&#39;re gonna experiment.  They&#39;re gonna try anything that springs t&#39;mind.  They&#39;re not gonna be slow an&#39; careful in figurin&#39; out what they can do.  We get one o&#39; them, we pull out th&#39; big guns.

Now, it don&#39;t always end with us killin&#39; &#39;em.  Sometimes, especially older ones, we can talk with &#39;em, a little.  Convince &#39;em the world ain&#39;t worth it.  Get &#39;em to move on somewhere else.  A lot of &#39;em will even do it on their own.  So far, ain&#39;t one of &#39;em ever come back.  No one knows just why.  Maybe this world really is that much of a shithole.  Or maybe somethin&#39;s eatin&#39; &#39;em, I don&#39;t know.

Anyway, now you see what I mean when I say a giant turtle ain&#39;t no big deal, even if it is spittin&#39; fire at us.</textarea></pre>
