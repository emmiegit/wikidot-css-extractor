[[size larger]]**Description:**[[/size]] SCP-5120 is an ancient city named Fidelis Roma. SCP-5120 was founded sometime between 337 and 361 AC, and has remained isolated until its discovery in 2004. It is distinctly Roman in origin but lacks influence from the Abrahamic faiths. SCP-5120 has a small population compared to its size, leading to the majority of houses being unoccupied. A notable land mark of SCP-5120 is the Grand Library, where documents previously thought lost to time can be found.

40% of SCP-5120 is buried underneath the undecomposed corpse of an anomalous organism, 5 km in length, similar to //Canis lupus italicus// designated SCP-5120-1. SCP-5120-1 produces a perception filter, directing the attention of an observer away from the area, measuring approximately 7 kilometers in diameter from the center of the city. Once an individual is made aware of the perception filter, it loses efficacy and the individual can perceive SCP-5120 normally.

During a raid on a hostile chapter of the Church of the Broken God, Foundation personnel discovered three documents written in Latin that were of notable interest. They appear to be communication between the Church of the Broken God and an unknown second party. Reviewing surveillance tapes from before the raid identified an individual working as a courier between the Church of the Broken God and the unknown party. The Foundation has begun an investigation into the origin of these documents.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

//[ Dr. Horne is standing with Flamen Volturnalis outside the temple overlooking a river. The sun has just begun to rise. ]//

**Dr. Horne:** Thank you for allowing me to ask you some questions.

**Flamen Volturnalis:** It is my pleasure. You are one of us now, a true Roman as we say. I will answer any questions that may plague you.

//[ The Flame puts a hand on Dr. Horne&#39;s shoulder. ]//

**Flamen Volturnalis:** By the way, your Latin is very good.

**Dr. Horne:** Thank you, I am still getting used to speaking Latin, but I appreciate you saying that.

//[ Dr. Horne smiles. ]//

**Dr. Horne:** Okay, to start things off, I would like you to tell me about yourself.

//[ The Flame pushes his chest out and holds his fist to his chest. ]//

**Flamen Volturnalis:** I am The Flamen Volturnalis, a member of the sub-council who decides on laws. As well as a judge in all matters of //Fidelis Roma//.

//[ The Flame starts to gesture as he talks. ]//

**Flamen Volturnalis:** The priest of Volturnus, god of all rivers, as well as a member of the Minor Flamens. I am the caretaker of the river and a humble servant to //Fidelis Roma//.

//[ Dr. Horne finishes writing in her notes. ]//

**Dr. Horne:** I’m very interested in the details of your work, but for now, I have another question. When we discovered Fidelis Roma, your people were trying to contact the Church of the Broken God. Can you tell me what you know about them?

//[ The Flame pauses and gives a perplexed expression. ]//

**Flamen Volturnalis:** I... assume you are speaking of the god Mekhane. That&#39;s what we call him. He was once worshiped by a section of our people a long time ago before we found sanctuary here. They attempted to proclaim their god higher than all others, and they were rightfully expelled.

**Dr. Horne:** May I ask why your people would contact them for aid?

//[ The Flame crosses his arms and turns to look at the river. ]//

**Flamen Volturnalis:**  Matters such as those are up to the high-council. I was not there. I would have voted against the decision if I was. They are not to be trusted. The only reason I could see the Major Flames stoop to such a low would be out of desperation.

**Dr. Horne:** Are there any objects or documents related to Mekhane inside the city?

//[ The Flame turns away from the river, back to Dr. Horne. ]//

**Flamen Volturnalis:** No. We would not keep artifacts related to that thing. Though there could be documents in the Grand Library.

**Dr. Horne:** Thank you, I plan on visiting the library soon. Now, what can you tell me about the Mother of Rome?

**Flamen Volturnalis:** She is our protector. She is the one who guided our people to this city.

//[ The Flame began to raise his arms to the air. ]//

**Flamen Volturnalis:** This city was crafted by the gods. A place where our people could live and worship without judgment and persecution. The Mother of Rome was a beacon for us to follow. As you are aware, she can only be seen by those she allows to see her. Without her, we would have been discovered long ago. We are thankful to her.

**Dr. Horne:** I have been to see her. She is quite a wonder. Can you tell me more about her history?

//[ The Flamen Volturnalis pauses before answering. ]//

**Flamen Volturnalis:** Long ago the city was attacked. She acted as a shield and allowed herself to be wounded to protect the people of //Fidelis Roma//. Many of our people perished, but we survived. Ever since she has given us the gift of isolation. We are safe because of her. She... is our savior.

//[ An apostle of Voltunalis calls for the Flamen. ]//

**Flamen Volturnalis:** If you would pardon me, It appears I am needed. It was a pleasure speaking with you.

//[ The Flamen shakes Dr. Horne&#39;s hand. ]//

**Dr. Horne:** Thank you for your time.

**Flamen Volturnalis:** Good luck with your research Dr. Horne.

My meeting with the Flamen Volturnalis led me to search for any documents related to the Church. I visited the Grand Library in search of more information, though I estimate that my research will be strenuous due to the size of the library&#39;s collection of books. I have also been unable to meet any Major Flamens for an interview.

I have also logged some unusually high Hume levels inside of SCP-5120. These readings occur throughout SCP-5120, but seem to cluster around SCP-5120-1. Perception filters do alter Hume levels on a minor scale, but the readings I have acquired read much higher. I have also found that these readings are not consistent. It seems as if they are moving.

The diplomatic team have negotiated with the Council Fideliss Roma, and have arranged for you to interview the Flamen Dialis so that you may ascertain more information on their connection to the Church of the Broken God, and the locations of any artifacts they may have.

You are also instructed to gather more information on the events that lead to SCP-5120-1&#39;s demise, and continue testing Hume levels throughout SCP-5120.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

//[ Dr. Horne waits in a room inside the Temple of Mars. It is mid-afternoon. The Flamen walks in and sits down. ]//

**Dr. Horne:** Thank you for accepting my interview.

**Flamen Dialis:** That is what we agreed to. Forgive me if I seem rude but I am very busy so I will ask that this interview be short if possible.

**Dr. Horne:** I only have a few questions.

//[ Dr. Horne paused to look at her notes. ]//

**Dr. Horne:** My first question pertains to the decision to ask The Church of the Broken God for aid. I was told that you voted on this matter. Can you tell me about that?

//[ The Flame crosses his arms. ]//

**Flamen Dialis:** That&#39;s correct. We made our decision, and promised to pay them for aid. Nothing more. They asked for too much, so we declined... I am not surprised though. We gave them an opportunity and they squandered it. Blinded by their own fanaticism.

**Dr. Horne:** I appreciate your views on the Church, but I was curious as to what you thought of their desire for a part of their God.

**Flamen Dialis:** It is ridiculous. They are desperate to gather their &#34;God&#34; and are naive. We do not hold any of their artifacts within our city. Why would we bring any of their relics with us to this place? That would be blasphemy.

**Dr. Horne:** Thank you for elaborating.

//[ Dr. Horne glances at her notes again. ]//

**Dr. Horne:** I understand the Mother died defending this city. Can I ask you who she was defending it from?

**Flamen Dialis:** The culprit is unknown to us. The few survivors of the fall of The Mother of Rome hid underground. Anyone who witnessed what happened that day, died that day. It was a great tragedy that the people of //Fidelis Roma// mourn to this day.

**Dr. Horne:** You&#39;re saying there is no information at all about that day?

**Flamen Dialis:** There is nothing. Not even in our sacred records. What we have been lead to assume is that somehow, an enemy of Rome was able to enter our sanctuary. We believe the Christians are to blame. Emperor Constantius persecuted us and led us to flee to this city. Replacing our Gods with theirs. Who else are we to suspect?

**Dr. Horne:** The Christians?

//[ The Flame nodded. ]//

**Flamen Dialis:** Many of our ancestors were forced from their homes in Rome when the Christians took control. They mutilated our culture and persecuted us for our beliefs. They are the most likely culprit.

**Dr. Horne:** Is there any documentation that would prove they were the culprit?

//[ The Flame glares at Dr. Horne. ]//

**Flamen Dialis:** You have lived with us for how long?... 3 months?... 4? You&#39;re always looking for the same thing. You have been told we don&#39;t know what happened to her, and yet you keep asking.

**Dr. Horne:** Well, Yes, I&#39;m researching your pe-

//[ The Flame stands up and interrupts Dr. Horne. ]//

**Flamen Dialis:** Let me give you some free advice. We allow you to live here because we need supplies. This is your home now. Take your time and don&#39;t search for things you won&#39;t find.

//[ Dr. Horne is silent for some time. ]//

**Dr. Horne:** I... I guess I have no further questions.

//[ The Flame stands up from his chair. ]//

**Flamen Dialis:** Now if you would excuse me, I must start the sacrifice to Mars.

I have continued my search for artifacts connected to The Broken God, and have concluded that there are none within the city. I have discovered documents inside The Library that may be of interest. these documents have been submitted alongside my interview logs.

The Hume levels have continued their trend of changing locations. I experimented by leaving a Kant counter in the same place for 24 hours and logging the results. I found that the Hume levels fluctuate in waves and then spike randomly. These spikes read extraordinarily high and lasted on average for 10 minutes. These results lead me to believe that SCP-5120-1 is either alive and producing these readings, or these are the after-effects of whatever event caused SCP-5120-1 to perish.

I plan on focusing the rest of my research inside The Grand Library of Fidelis Roma, and continue to transcribe any documents of interest. I will also continue my search for Broken God artifacts if deemed necessary.
