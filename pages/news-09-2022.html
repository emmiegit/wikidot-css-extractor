++ So, what is a Kcon anyway?
[[/=]]

A little over a month or so ago, you may have noticed an absence of articles or perhaps a lack of authors overall! Well, it was that time of year again when everyone runs to their writing stations to prepare for the newest k-con!

Most of the 6000s have already filled up, meaning everyone was getting ready to place their first dibs on their favourite 7000 slots, including the triple ‘O’ spot itself. If you’ve ever wondered how we choose who gets what or why everyone is freaking out so much about this contest specifically, then this article is for you!

In the past, we have had six of these k-contests, each pulling the best of the best from the community and giving us the first article to start the new slots. So far, that&#39;s included a top 15 article of all time; SCP-5000. Five of the six have made it into the top 35! That may seem low, but out of the approximate 7000+ SCPs, that cracks at being in the top 0.5%.

If you haven’t guessed already, to win the contest you must achieve the most upvotes of all other participants at the moment of the contest&#39;s closure. The prize for all that hard work? A pretty number.

That doesn’t sound too impressive, but winning the contest comes with massive bragging rights and is not something anyone takes lightly. It takes insane amounts of skill, dedication, and, dare I say, //luck// to make it to number one and stay there. With all the competition, everyone is fighting for reads, and critique is harsher than ever.

The prizes don&#39;t end there, though. Everyone who participated picks in order of their position what slot they’d like to take in the new slots/It&#39;s first dibs on numbers that are usually stolen off the bat, such as; 7500, 7999, 7777 and 7001.

As hard as it sounds, winning is an extraordinary and honourable position. Don’t let fears about being new, inexperienced or being a lesser-known author deter you from participating. Many new or unestablished users have gotten their foot in the door just by participating due to the high influx of activity on the site while the contest occurs. There&#39;s also a unique method introduced to keep users from drafting too far ahead; themes.
Every k-contest has a theme chosen at the very start, this year’s being “Luck.”

Themes are an interesting way of keeping authors on their toes and providing a challenge or perhaps a prompt that keeps the contest less spontaneous and random. The theme is usually known by very few staff, so you should never be worried that someone has an advantage over you.

Past themes have included Urban Legends, Sci-fi, Horror, History, Mystery, and Nature. Though, if you go through the winners of each respective theme, you’ll often find that the theme is tied in loosely, playing its role but not defining the entry in its whole. Themes are a fun guideline, encouraging thinking outside the box.

The thousand contests are a time for celebration, collaboration, and a peak in the site’s creativity. Whether you participate or not, whether you write or create in wholly unique ways, it’s a time when we can relish the spotlight we deserve.

+++ Reviewers&#39; Spotlights
[[/=]]

Works are featured on the site’s front page as part of the Reviewers’ Spotlight, which acknowledges the time and effort spent by forum reviewers helping other authors develop and edit and their works for the mainsite. Each month, community members are encouraged to nominate forum reviewers who have been both particularly helpful and active. Members of the Forum Criticism Team will then discuss the nominations, and select four prominent reviewers to choose the month’s Reviewers’ Spotlight front-page features.

All the goings-on of the site condensed into bite-sized takeaways! Is there a statistic or figure you would be interested in knowing? Let us know and we can feature it next time!

We&#39;re still recovering from the loss of our data infrastructure in the Wikidot outage, so please bear with us if our stats are more rudimentary than before.
