&#34;Fear and Loathing in the Wanderers&#39; Library&#34; is exactly this: &#34;What if Hunter S. Thompson... but lizard?&#34;

All jokes aside, this hub and its contents are meant to be a strange parody/tribute for the one and only creator of gonzo journalism, the aforementioned Hunter S. Thompson, here presented as walking, talking Jackson&#39;s Chameleon (//Trioceros jacksonii//) called Duke Gathers. 
    
Gonzo journalism is the genre Hunter and Duke most prominently use in their works. Long story short, gonzo is a type of narrative where the author is the protagonist. In other words, a gonzo journalist such as our friend Gathers doesn&#39;t just write a story: he experiences it in its entirely, no matter if the subject to cover is good or bad. 

If you want to write a piece of gonzo in such a way it would seem like a legit Duke-written article, it&#39;d need to have these characteristics:

* The articles must only be written in 1st person format.
* Generally speaking, gonzo pieces follow the &#34;shockumentary&#34; way. They have to be ugly looking and grossly descriptive on purpose.
* A really big usage of colorful language, included but not limited to insults, slang, sarcasm and specially metaphors and surreal descriptions.
* Most importantly, gonzo is used as a form of critique and/or mockery of any subject, be it political or social. Try make your piece as critical as possible about a certain topic. 
* Last but not least, a gonzo author is 100% involved with the environment and its people, even if the situation disgusts them. Make Duke be as interactive as possible.

Keeping in line with that, new posters should read the original series, in order to get acquainted with how Duke Gathers walks, talks, writes and lives his life. It is highly encouraged that your piece portrays Duke as doing at least two of the following:

* Reporting on weird (or sometimes mundane) events with a visceral, rambling, hyperbolic approach.
* Consuming copious amounts of drugs and alcohol. 
* Shooting at and/or making stuff explode.
* Dealing with the everyday hardships of being an uncompromising journalist in a world of phonies and hypocrites.

As recommended (but not obligatory) reference materials, Thompson&#39;s iconic work, //[[[http://brianb.freeshell.org/a/kddd.pdf | The Kentucky Derby is Decadent and Depraved]]]// and the movie //Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas// are second to none.

Happy reading, and use drugs responsibly.
