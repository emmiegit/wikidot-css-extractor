**Item description:** &#34;Prangles&#34;. Item resembles in almost every way a standard tube of Pringles, Sour Cream and Onion flavour. The only difference in appearance is that the mascot on the box has red skin and takes on a vaguely demonic look. Item was given to a Class D subject. Once the lid of the Prangles is unsealed, or &#34;popped&#34;, the subject was literally unable to prevent herself from eating the chips continuously. Moreover, the tube appears to be bottomless in nature, as the subject has been eating for several days at time of writing and shows no sign of slowing down. No difference between the chips and normal Pringles was found. This is the second subject to be tested; the first one continued eating even after termination, and the tube had to be forcibly removed from her grasp.

D-20883 verbally expressed their incredulity at the tedium of the task but complied, counting one thousand (1000) grains of the solid.  D-20883 subsequently instructed to consume one grain at a time and describe the flavor. Each of the 1000 grains was invariably described by D-20883 as “salty” or some variation thereof, despite requests for more detailed descriptions. When provided with water following the experiment, D-20883 voiced complaints that it tasted “salty”. Subject claimed that their symptoms persisted for all food or drink, regardless of composition, until their termination.

**Item description:** A large metal cube with various green pictographs engraved onto its surface. Initial attempts at ingestion were unsuccessful, as the object showed no immediate method by which to consume it. After subject&#39;s saliva made contact with the cube, the point of contact began to rapidly rust, with the subject reporting a foul metallic taste. Subject was instructed to lick the rest of the object until its surface was completely covered in rust. Following this, subject stated that they felt sated and did not require additional sustenance for 24 hours. Further examination of the cube found that the pictographs had since faded, and were replaced by a large red &#34;X&#34; symbol on each face.

**Item Description:** “Russian Roulette Drops” - A 12cm long tube, dense plastic, text in Cyrillic, but with English spelling, produced by “Red Star”.  Tube has two small pressure pads positioned to either side of one end, with a small, sealed hole on the same end, outer wrapping depicts a realistic gun barrel under the text.  Description on the package indicates item is candy, and intended to be shared among “one&#39;s most brave or foolish friends”.  Instructions are to bite down on the pressure pads, which will cause a candy to be dispensed into the mouth.

Assembled researchers, by mutual consent, began testing.  Biting on the plates causes a small, white pellet to be dispensed into the mouth, tasting “like a sugar cube”.  The outer shell dissolves within five seconds, releasing the inner filling.  It appears eight pellets are contained in the tube, and it is constructed in such a way as to discourage casual tampering.  Noted flavors include chocolate frosting, blueberry, and orange cola.

It appears that, with each tube, one pellet is designated the “kill shot”, as described on the package.  This pellet dissolves to release a liquid filling that is 85% pure capsaicin, the remainder being a dense form of syrup which causes great difficulty in immediately neutralizing the substance.  Dr. Henjik received the “kill shot”, and was remanded to medical for breathing issues and possible allergic reaction.  Full recovery was declared after four hours, no additional anomalous properties noted.

Bottle has a standard twist-off metal cap, and appears to have been made in Japan for the US market.  Liquid is mostly clear with a slightly blue tint.  Liquid is uncarbonated and very sweet, also including a vague berry flavor (which could not be determined) and a slight taste of salt.  Researchers described it as somewhat similar to a sports drink, and testing indicated a similar composition to several commercially available sports drinks, with a marked higher content of sugar and sodium.  Texture is slightly syrupy, and will leave a sticky residue on surfaces.

No additional anomalous properties noted; however, it has been observed that those who reported the highest enjoyment of the item also scored the highest on the TSR-88 Cruelty Index during annual testing.  Investigation in to possible relationship is ongoing.

**Item description:** &#34;Prototype 3&#34; - A cardboard box, labeling handwritten in black marker. Contents consisted of a small black cube, similar in size to a portable television, and a second cardboard box containing 47 unmarked storage disks resembling Zip drives. Disks were unmarked, save for hand-drawn images of various fruits and vegetables. Examination of the black cube revealed a large slot near its base, alongside two buttons, red and white in color. The top of the cube is covered by a thick glass lens. Inserting one of the disks will cause the cube to display a holographic image of the food depicted on the disk. Subjects were able to &#34;consume&#34; the images by miming consumption of the foods, which would cause the image to display the relevant sections of the food as consumed. Following the complete consumption of the food, subjects reportedly felt well-fed, and did not require additional food for the following eight hours.
