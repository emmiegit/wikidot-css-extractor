It&#39;s been a little while since I&#39;ve last seen my kids.

That fucking dirtbag, Jerry... at least he got to rot in hell, without this pain. Should&#39;ve shot him in the nuts instead of the head.

It&#39;s been three years since I&#39;ve been sentenced. Two weeks ago, though, a man working for this so-called &#34;Foundation&#34; thingy asked me if I wanted to participate in some research study.

I asked him what I got in return, and he said after a month, I could be free. Of course, I would accept such an offer, anything to get me out of this piece-of-shit prison cell.

Whatever these scientist-douchebags injected me with, it&#39;s painful.

They watched behind glass windows as I bled out. I kept bleeding, but refused to die. Those men in their white jackets, continuing to watch over me.

Finally, the bleeding stopped. They allowed me to rest, at least for a short while, before they injected me with something else...

... when I woke up, I was already forced into a clear box, and above a shaft. Holy shit - that&#39;s one long drop down.

I heard a microphone asking me to &#34;concentrate&#34; on growing wings. How the fuck was I supposed to do that? Of course, I told them to go fuck themselves. They gave me 15 minutes, and I saw a timer start counting down from 15. I didn&#39;t know what would happen at 0, but I didn&#39;t want to find out.

I felt my body shake, as if something began to tear its way from my back. I thought for a short while about what they injected me with, and... maybe, I could grow wings.

With every last bit of my will, I forced my body to grow these &#34;wings&#34;. It felt like an eternity, forcing these painful shards out of my back.

And they grew. Ugly, flesh-formed wings like a bat, but they&#39;re still wings. The timer was at 2 minutes.

I forced open the lid of the box. Thankfully, it wasn&#39;t reinforced or locked or anything.

I spread my wings, and began to fly. Almost fell down the first few flaps, but got the hang of this.

As I began to fly to the surface, I thought of my kids once more. I could go see them again!

I saw some scientists in their ugly orange suits and some military guys in black follow me. They can&#39;t catch me now!

I&#39;m almost free! I&#39;m almost-

&gt; //&#34;D-11621 was infected with [[[SCP-016]]] on ██/██/████, and managed to survive the near-total exsanguination. D-11621 was placed in an acrylic box suspended above a mine shaft, and was told to focus on growing wings, and given 15 minutes before the bomb detonated. At the two minute mark, it was observed that D-11621 finally grew out a fully-formed set of wings, similar to a bat. Using these wings, D-11621 was able to escape the mine shaft and fly above Testing Area-██. Subject was terminated by gunshot fired from a Mossberg 500 shotgun. Autopsy  revealed the wings anchored to the shoulder blades, and the muscles also attached to the shoulder blades and collar bones. Genetic testing of D-11621 is underway, to determine if genetic makeup affects the outcome of 016 mutation. - Dr. E. K. Sze//</textarea></pre>
