&gt; Journal Entry Number One (and possibly the only)
&gt; 
&gt; My name is Sergeant James Maloney. If you are reading this now, I need your help. I was working with a UN peacekeeping force when my squad was sent to guard a Library. They all died, and now I&#39;m stuck here, I&#39;ve been here so long; I think I might be going crazy. You need to get a message to Major Jacob Arnold from the UN Infantry Battalion. Just print this out and get it to him, please, my life and yours may depend on it. 
&gt; 
&gt; Attn: Major Arnold:
&gt; Objective status: Unknown
&gt; Current locstat: In a Library / LOST
&gt; Personnel: Deceased / Unknown
&gt; 
&gt; Situation Update:
&gt; Sir;
&gt; I have found a computer; it looks like something from a steampunk gallery. It&#39;s all oak panels and brass fittings, but it connects to things, to places, god, I can&#39;t even begin to explain it. I stumbled on it by accident; I was looking for the 900&#39;s stack again. Got to find a fucking map so I can get the hell out of here, if there is an out of here, maybe I&#39;m lost here forever. 
&gt; 
&gt; Mike has been haunting me; he&#39;s some tall skinny inky bastard now. I think he wants to eat me. I don&#39;t blame him, I&#39;d have to taste better than the shit they call food hereabouts. I really want a coffee, fuck I&#39;d sell my very soul for a plate of my mother&#39;s home cooking right now. Don&#39;t know what the fuck Mike was doing with us in the first place, kid was a desk jockey. I don&#39;t even remember seeing him before he got landed in my squad come to think of it...
&gt; 
&gt; I think I&#39;m rambling again; this place does that to you. Can&#39;t ever find the same fucking place twice, so I guess I&#39;ll never know if you get this Sir.
&gt; 
&gt; Don&#39;t send anyone in to find me. Sir. Don&#39;t do it. Don&#39;t even consider it. Just tell my family I&#39;m dead. It&#39;s better they have closure. This place is nothing like what I was briefed about. There are aliens here, just walking about and reading books! And it connects to places. It&#39;s one hell of a security risk, if anyone can ever find a way to our world. I know I can&#39;t.
&gt; 
&gt; I hear whispers, the books talk to me sometimes. The shit they say would make your toes curl. I think there are secrets here that would make us a fortune, win wars, send us to other galaxies. If I could just figure out how to bring them back home.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh shit, he&#39;s found me  abjhl.vfb vk/;bhajdf/a/df
