**Item #:** SCP-2463

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Each instance of SCP-2463 is to be kept in a separate standard containment locker at Site-19. At no point should any instance of SCP-2463 come into contact with any other instance of SCP-2463. Access to single instances of SCP-2463 is restricted to personnel with security clearance of 3 or higher, and access to multiple instances is not permitted at this time.

Any personnel found attempting to remove any number of SCP-2463 instances from designated testing rooms are to be immediately detained and held for questioning.

**Description:**  SCP-2463 is a set of six bronze horses, each approximately 6 cm tall, and believed to be Ancient Roman in origin. Various dating methods have placed the creation of SCP-2463 at circa 250 CE. SCP-2463’s anomalous properties begin to manifest when instances are exposed to water collected from naturally occurring sources[[footnote]]Tests have determined that any water collected from natural bodies of water (including lakes, rivers, seas, oceans, and subterranean springs, etc.) will activate SCP-2463. Water from artificial sources, such as canals, or man-made reservoirs, will not activate SCP-2463.[[/footnote]]. SCP-2463 instances that are exposed to any such water, will begin converting the water into petroleum through an unknown process. This conversion takes place at a rate of approximately 63 mL per hour. 

If separate instances of SCP-2463 come into physical contact, this conversion rate will scale exponentially with the number of instances, so that when all six instances are in contact, the conversion will occur at a rate of approximately 62,523,502 L per hour, allowing large volumes of water to be converted very quickly.

SCP-2463 was discovered during a raid on a storage facility in ███████, New York, which was believed to be owned by Marshall, Carter and Dark LLP. The raid was conducted by Mobile Task Force Mu-3 (“Highest Bidders”), and resulted in recovery of SCP-2463 as well as [[[SCP-2635]]] and [[[SCP-1738]]], along with several documents and items currently awaiting cataloging.

MTF-M3 was discovered during their mission, and as a result, several Foundation personnel were killed in the course of duty. SCP-2463 was briefly activated during recovery, but was successfully contained by remaining MTF-M3 operatives.

For further information on the recovery of SCP-2463, consult Recovery Log-2463.

**Addendum-2463-1:**  In addition to SCP-2463, MTF-M3 also recovered a Marshall, Carter and Dark item listing for the object. This document has been designated as [[[MCD-little-draft-horses|Document-2463-1]]].

**Addendum-2463-2:** Found with Document-2463-1 was a transcript of a letter believed to have been translated from ancient Latin, written to the Roman Emperor Gallienus[[footnote]]Roman Emperor who ruled with his father, Emperor Valerian, from 253 to 260 and then alone until his death in 268, at the age of 50.[[/footnote]] by an as of yet unidentified person. For a transcript of this letter, see below.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Document-2463-2&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]
&gt; //To Imperator Publius Licinius Egnatius Gallienus Augustus//
&gt; 
&gt; //We are deeply saddened to learn of the death of your great father, and write to you in order to settle a pressing matter of business left unresolved by the venerable emperor.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Shortly after his capture at Edessa by Shahansha Shapur, your father wrote to Us from Bishapur, seeking aid on behalf of The Empire. On his request, We have procured a number of items that we believe met the needs he expressed.//
&gt; 
&gt; //We will happily pass along these items to you, so long as We are paid the price that was arranged by your honorable father, that being a sum of 60,000,000 Aurei. We are aware that the price seems extreme, but so were the demands of your father.//
&gt; 
&gt; //&#34;A force to wipe out the Persian dogs. To make barren their lands, and sickly their people. A force to destroy every square foot on which they have ever walked and to plague their kingdom with bloodshed for millennia.&#34;//
&gt; 
&gt; //These were the feats required of us by the deific Valerianus, and for this power We must ask for equal renumeration.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Should you decide not to pay, We shall retain possession of the items until a time when We are payed what We have asked.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Your loyal servant, D. Mercator.//
