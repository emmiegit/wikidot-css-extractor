**Item #:** SCP-1883

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** 17 copies of SCP-1883 are kept on mobile phones of various brands in storage at Wing D of Site 76. The phones are to be kept off when not in use, and only allowed to access the phone network through Site 76&#39;s secure data connection. When testing SCP-1883 tasks, ensure that targets of tasks are D-Classes or subjects abiding by the Ludd Antitechnic Directive (annexed).

All extant copies of SCP-1883 must be erased with expedience after their origin is ascertained. █████ and ██████ corporations have been instructed to report any copies of SCP-1883 to Sigma Computing &amp; Programmatics, one of the Foundation&#39;s cover businesses.

**Description:** SCP-1883 is a &#34;mobile app&#34; or consumer software application designed to run on mobile phones running either ███ or ██████ operating systems. The interface for SCP-1883 consists of a single screen with a text area labeled &#34;Score&#34; and another labeled &#34;Instructions&#34;.

Provided a phone with SCP-1883 is connected to the mobile network, the &#34;Instructions&#34; field will be updated every 5 to 9 hours with a new &#34;task&#34; that the holder of the mobile phone is to perform, and an award in &#34;points&#34;. If this task is performed before the instruction field changes, the &#34;Score&#34; field is increased by the number of points described. It is not known how SCP-1883 detects whether a task has been completed.

Certain instructions require the user to interact with other human beings, by phone or in person. (e.g. &#34;Call your friend that most hates spinach and tell them hello - //3 points//&#34;) When such an interaction is performed, SCP-1883 spreads to the victim&#39;s mobile phone or phones through unknown means.

SCP-1883 has a subtle compulsive effect on users, who describe the application using words as &#34;interesting&#34; and &#34;fun&#34; and attempt to perform the tasks even if they are pointless, dangerous or unlawful. This effect increases with large groups of SCP-1883 users, who compete with each other for points and follow informal hierarchies based on each user&#39;s score.

SCP-1883 has come to the attention of the Foundation after the ██/██/████ incident, where at least 72 people in the cities of [REDACTED] irreparably wounded their left eyes with various household objects. Most of them were found to be in possession of a mobile phone with SCP-1883 installed.

**Instruction Log:**
