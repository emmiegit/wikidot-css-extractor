**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to SCP-6153&#39;s effect being unable to be contained due to the lack of TCEDs, the location and capture of SCP-6153-I through SCP-6153-XIII is to be the primary goal of STF Overwatch-5 (&#34;Fickle Fortune&#34;) and the Administrator of the Foundation.

**Description:** SCP-6153 is a probabilistic anomaly causing disproportionately beneficial or harmful events occurring to an individual, colloquially known as &#34;luck&#34;. The exception to this, however, 13 individuals, formerly the O5 council, designated SCP-6153-I through SCP-VIII. SCP-6153-I through SCP-6153-VIII all have estimated Tyche Radiation levels of over 10,000 times the previously theorized limit due to the amount of TCEDs to increase their already substantial Tyche levels. Every action the former council takes results in the absolute best outcome based on their intentions. Of note is that after the completion of the aforementioned event, a probabilistic anomaly occurred, causing SCP-6153-I through -XIII to gain class II or higher reality-warping abilities. 

**Incident report 6153-10/12/04:**

Description: On 10/12/22 the 05 Council began using an unknown amount of TCEDs containing positive Tyche Radiation to increase their own Tyche levels. This event was covered up with all footage being expunged from foundation records, current information regarding the event is speculation based on the aftermath and incident 11/15/04

**Incident Report 6153-11/15/04**

**Description:** Following Incident Report 6153-10/12/04 (see above), the O5 council performed a thaumaturgical ritual created and overseen by O5-8, a class VII Thaumaturgist. The following recording of the event may have incomplete annotations, due to unknown factors of the ritual itself

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**&lt;Begin Log, 23:50&gt;**

[13 unidentifiable figures (presumed to be the O5 council, due to the red numbers written the back of their clothing) wearing black hooded cloaks stand on the points of a large tridecagram[[footnote]]A star with 13 points[[/footnote]]composed of an unknown red powder.]

**O5-12:** O, great Gods of Fortune, we come to request your favor and help in trials to come. We have served you faithfully, following your every word and desire. 

[Each member of the O5 Council raises a chalice, presumed to be composed of gold, and drinks the unidentified liquid inside.]

[O5-12 raises her hand, and a large blue flame appears in the center of the tridecagram.]

**O5-1:** Almighty ones, please accept our offering.

[Each Council member pulls an object out from underneath their cloak that is typically associated with luck.]

**O5-1:** Vesunna. [O5-1 throws a copper amulet in the shape of a Celtic Knotwork into the flame.]

**O5-2:** Freyr. [O5-2 throws two fused clavicles[[footnote]]A Wishbone[[/footnote]] into the flame.]

**O5-3:** Nahuatl. [O5-3 throws a //Trifolium repens// with four leaves into the flame.]

**O5-4:** Fuxing. [O5-4 throws a jade amulet in the shape of a snake into the flame.]

**O5-5:** Saint Cajetan. [O5-5 throws an Ojibwe dreamcatcher into the flame.]

**O5-6:** Tyche. [O5-6 throws a pomegranate into the flame.]

**O5-7:** Khonsu. [O5-7 throws a copper amulet in the shape of a scarab into the flame.]

**O5-8:** Saint Lovelace.[[footnote]]Ada Lovelace was a 19th-century mathematician and is generally considered the world&#39;s first computer programmer. Lovelace is considered to be canonized among some [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/church-of-the-broken-god-hub Maxwellist] circles, being the saint of error-free processes, good fortune, and efficient coding.[[/footnote]]. [O5-8 throws a piece of red coral into the flames.]

**O5-9:** Buluc Chabtan. [O5-9 throws a gold coin into the flame.]

**O5-10:** John Frum. [O5-10 throws an //Amanita muscaria//[[footnote]]Fly Amanita Mushroom[[/footnote]] into the flame.]

**O5-11:** Ebisu. [O5-11 throws a wooden plaque [[footnote]]Believed to be an Ema wishing plaque [[/footnote]] into the flames.]

**O5-12:** Fortuna. [[O5-12 throws the detached foot of a //O. cuniculus domesticus// into the flame]]

**O5-13:** Lakshmi. [[O5-13 throws a horseshoe into the flame.]]

[A **[DATA CORRUPTED]** appears in the center of the flame, believed to be **[DATA CORRUPTED]**.]

**[DATA CORRUPTED]:** Well, well. You actually went through with it.

[The large flame in the center begins to expand outwards, engulfing the O5 Council, before destroying the TCEDs placed behind them. The footage then ends, with the camera being presumably destroyed.]

[Log End &lt;**[DATA CORRUPTED]**&gt;]
[[/div]]
**Closing Statement:** 

Following the Council&#39;s use of all remaining TCEDs, Site-87 operations have begun to recline, and the amount of natural -B events has increased by over 1000%, becoming difficult to contain. In addition, the current location of the O5 Council is unknown. It is currently theorized that the extreme Tyche levels present with them caused a spatial anomaly to occur around them, transporting them to an unknown location. Locating and attempting contact with Council members is now the top priority of the Department of Anomalous Probability.

**Note from the Administrator**
Hello. If you are reading this document, you are one of the 13 individuals I have handpicked for a special task force. Before today, most of you have never heard of SCP-6153, and some of you didn&#39;t even work for the Foundation. Here&#39;s what you need to know about this: we fucked up, and badly. We tried to protect the original Overseers and instead made them gods. They went mad with power and disappeared. It&#39;s our job to take them down and return luck to the world. Good luck, Overseer.
