I don&#39;t care.

No, in all seriousness. That&#39;s the answer to your question. I don&#39;t care.

Apathy is stronger body armor than anything else. Why should I care that there&#39;s a damned great lizard running loose? I have papers to file, dammit! Why should I give a damn that the semen-eating girl is loose and headed for my sector? I&#39;m on break.

Everything&#39;s a narrative. Everything, especially real life. This one, that is. I have suspicions regarding other &#39;real lifes&#39; that I&#39;m working on in my spare time. But I digress. Narratives. They exist in the world, just as coincidences do. They aren&#39;t very strong, mostly just a set of cliches played out repeatedly. Trained task forces fall easily while resourceful civilians manage to save the day; head researchers who by rights ought to be filing paperwork take on the dangerous task of decomming a dangerous SCP; 682 escapes and starts a rampage; things like that. And people always act as they would in a bad thriller, or a bad sci-fi, or a bad action flick. Except me.

That&#39;s how I&#39;ve lived to be ninety, kid. I don&#39;t care what goes on around me, I do what needs to be done. I survived walking through the middle the Clef-Kondraki Incident because I didn&#39;t so much as acknowledge their presence. I got some coffee from the break room while Kondraki was in his battle suit, and I was in my office filing forms to request a budget for reconstruction of the Site when Clef was freezing the hallway. I&#39;m always that kind of person, and it&#39;s helped me survive. 682 rushed by an inch from my face, and I did nothing. Didn&#39;t so much as flinch.

That&#39;s another thing, you know? That bloody great lizard isn&#39;t hostile, it&#39;s reactionary. It&#39;s like a reverse of 173 - you watch it and feel any emotion or reaction regarding it and it hates you. That&#39;s why whatsisname&#39;s experiment with the kids didn&#39;t work, and why 053 got along so well with it. I just don&#39;t feel and don&#39;t react. It works for me.

That&#39;s how it works, kid. Take it or leave it, I don&#39;t much care.</textarea></pre>
