**Item #:** SCP-4623

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4623 is to be kept in a standard avian enclosure. In order to assess the mental health of SCP-4623, interviews are to be conducted weekly behind a reinforced glass pane, during which SCP-4623 is to be provided with a stylus or other writing stationery.

**Description:** SCP-4623 is a male //Strix aluco//, otherwise known as a tawny owl. SCP-4623 possesses a sufficient degree of motor skills in its talons to communicate through written poems[[footnote]]SCP-4623 is only fluent in English.[[/footnote]] on the bark of trees or in the dirt of its enclosure. Anatomical examination reveals that SCP-4623 possesses vocal cords consistent with that of a human.[[footnote]]There were no signs of any physical alterations in SCP-4623, and SCP-4623 has seemingly lost the ability to vocalize.[[/footnote]]

**Addendum 4623.1 -- Discovery and Acquisition:** SCP-4623 was recovered on 08/24/2011, following a report to animal control services describing an owl attempting to converse with tourists near Shakespeare&#39;s Globe[[footnote]]Located in London, England.[[/footnote]]. Foundation agents intercepted the call and came to retrieve SCP-4623 because of the possible demonstration of sapience, and all individuals believed to be interacting with SCP-4623 were subsequently administered Class-B amnestics prior to release. A disinformation campaign purporting SCP-4623 as being a marketing stunt for the theatre was initiated soon afterwards.

After acquisition of SCP-4623, Foundation agents obtained the following CCTV surveillance footage monitoring the area surrounding Shakespeare&#39;s Globe.

&gt; ----
&gt; = **{{[BEGIN LOG]}}**
&gt; 
&gt; **{{[08:50]}}** SCP-4623 is brought into the premises of the theatre by an as-of-yet unidentified person. The person leaves.
&gt; 
&gt; **{{[08:52]}}** SCP-4623 attempts to vocalize numerous times, appearing to be in a state of mild distress.
&gt; 
&gt; **{{[08:59]}}** SCP-4623 approaches a passerby, attempting to grab their attention while trying to squawk. Passerby responds with mild agitation, picking up their pace.
&gt; 
&gt; **{{[09:06]}}** SCP-4623 flaps its wings as it moves towards the eastern side of the theatre to approach an onlooker, unable to take flight.
&gt; 
&gt; **{{[09:08]}}** SCP-4623 scratches on the wall of the theatre with its talons, inscribing a short message.
&gt; 
&gt; **{{[09:10]}}** SCP-4623 concludes writing. A worker at the theatre notices SCP-4623, which tries to perch on the worker&#39;s arm and point to the words. In response, the worker screams and scares SCP-4623 away.
&gt; 
&gt; **{{[09:13]}}** SCP-4623 gathers various stones on the sidewalk using its beak and places them to spell out the word &#34;SHAKESPEARE&#34;.
&gt; 
&gt; **{{[09:16]}}** A passerby notices SCP-4623 constructing the message on the sidewalk. SCP-4623 notices the passerby, and rapidly taps the assortment of stones, occasionally pointing to itself with one of its talons. Passerby walks away.
&gt; 
&gt; **{{[09:19]}}** A pair of adolescents approach SCP-4623, trying to direct their attention to it and pointing once more to the stones. The adolescents briefly laugh, pick up one of the stones and throw it past SCP-4623. SCP-4623 grows agitated and scares the adolescents away.
&gt; 
&gt; **{{[09:21]}}** Irritated, SCP-4623 gathers additional stones, forming the sentence &#34;I AM SHAKESPEARE&#34;.
&gt; 
&gt; **{{[09:22]}}** A worker at the theatre notices the assortment of stones and approaches SCP-4623, which is frantically tapping around the stones. He partially sweeps away the stones and notifies animal control services of SCP-4623 before sweeping it with his broomstick. SCP-4623 becomes agitated and tries to attacks the passerby, quickly retreating afterwards.
&gt; 
&gt; **{{[09:25]}}** SCP-4623 grabs more assorted materials from the ground with its talons and attempts to reconstruct the sentence. After it is finished, SCP-4623 steps aside and waits for passersby to notice it again.
&gt; 
&gt; **{{[09:26]}}** A passerby leans over the message, then glances down to SCP-4623, who is harshly tugging at their pant leg with both talons and pecking at it. The passerby responds with aggression, shaking its leg and yelling at SCP-4623 to let go.
&gt; 
&gt; **{{[09:28]}}** After various failed attempts to pique the interest of passersby, SCP-4623 eventually grows agitated, sweeping away the writing with its wing and hunching over.
&gt; 
&gt; **{{[09:29]}}** Exhausted, SCP-4623 stumbles over to the entrance of the theatre and grabs a pamphlet on a kiosk for the theatre. SCP-4623 bumps into a passerby, holds up the pamphlet with its beak, and starts fervently scraping its talons on the passerby&#39;s shoe. The passerby quickly draws their foot backwards and swiftly moves away. After approximately 15 seconds, SCP-4623 abruptly stops and throws down its wings in resignation.
&gt; 
&gt; **{{[09:31]}}** SCP-4623 leans on the theatre wall, sways back and forth, and collapses in fatigue, resting there for the remaining duration of the incident log.
&gt; 
&gt; **{{[09:37]}}** Foundation operatives posing as animal control retrieve SCP-4623, who is currently unconscious.

**Addendum 4623.2 -- Audio Log:** On 09/10/2014, a raid on the headquarters of a group of interest situated in Yorkshire, England began. The MTF unit managed to recover an audio log, believed to depict a conversation pertinent to the understanding of SCP-4623.

&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** ...And this is where it&#39;s gonna take place, you see.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Yeah -- whoa, shit, you&#39;ve got like... a... //(Snaps fingers)// ...what&#39;s it called...
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** A pentagram?
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Yeah, that&#39;s it. Uh, so what&#39;re you going to put on it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** You&#39;ll see later. Feel free to seat yourself over there.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Oh, sure thing. You need any help with that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** No, no. I&#39;m a great deal more experienced with this than you would be. It is an art reserved for masters and unfit for amateurs.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Hmm, a little pretentious, but I got you.
&gt; 
&gt; //Voice 1 can be heard grabbing various boxes off a shelf and carefully setting them down on the floor.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** That looks heavy. You sure you don&#39;t want me to help?
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** I&#39;ve got it handled just fine... okay, I think I&#39;m mostly done here. I just need to get everything out...
&gt; 
&gt; //Sounds of removing plastic lids.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** So how sure do you think this... ritual&#39;s going to work?
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** Fairly certain. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll have ourselves a Shakespeare of our own in no time. //(Laughs quietly)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** //(Chuckles along with Voice 1)// Heh, yeah... hey, look, I can help you there with the books, just... tell me what I need to do. I think I can --
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** //(Miffed)// Look, you don&#39;t understand, it&#39;s all very precise: I need to have the right book at the right position pointed //just// right towards the center...
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Huh, guess I can&#39;t help you with that. Carry on.
&gt; 
&gt; //Sounds of books shuffling on the floor.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** So,  what are those books supposed to do? Like, we&#39;re not //summoning// Shakespeare or anything, right, so... why are we putting all his plays here?...
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** //(Sigh)// It&#39;s to channel his energy, his //essence//. If we just put, I don&#39;t know, cabbages instead of these, you wouldn&#39;t --
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Okay, okay, I get it. God, you&#39;re so smug and uppity just because you know how to perform a //ritual//. Has anyone ever told you that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** Yes, you, multiple times. And keep your mouth shut, or I&#39;m gonna cut your pay in half.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** //(Whispers)// Jesus...
&gt; 
&gt; //More sounds of shuffling books.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** ...Almost finished. Hey, I&#39;m going to need you to stand over there for me. And take this with you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Alright, sure... is this blood?
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** Yes, blood extracted from a live tawny owl. You&#39;re going to --
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Wait, hold on a second. Why can&#39;t you just make me //look// like Shakespeare? Why are we going through the trouble of turning me into an owl?
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** //(Agitated)// //Please// don&#39;t interrupt me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Yes, yes, I&#39;m sorry. Carry on.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** Well, for starters, it&#39;s a lot easier to transport consciousness into smaller bodies. And any old ass can make himself look like Shakespeare without any problem. You think anybody&#39;s going to believe that Shakespeare rose from the dead when you do it like that? No way! //(Brief pause)// But if we&#39;ve got a talking owl on our hands saying they&#39;re Shakespeare, well, then, we might be able to catch somebody&#39;s attention. //Then// we might be famous. Then we might be //rich//.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Makes sense.
&gt; 
&gt; //Sounds of a lighter igniting a flame.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** Anyway, once we get this thing going, you&#39;re going to ingest that blood you&#39;ve got right there through your nose.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** ...Wait, all of it? That&#39;s gonna sting like all hell...
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** Well, not all of it. You&#39;ll ingest half of it, and then pour the rest on your chest.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Okayyy... is this all necessary? Seems a little strange to me. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** Yes, it is required. And to be honest, this is relatively standard for rituals.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Hmm.
&gt; 
&gt; //Pause.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** ...So how am I going to move around as an owl? --
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** //(Sigh)// Look, you&#39;ll move around just fine. You might have some trouble flying, if it ever comes to that, but -- you&#39;ll learn how to do it fairly quickly. Now please, keep quiet and step back.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Okay. Sorry.
&gt; 
&gt; //Brief pause. A large quantity of liquid can be heard splattering on the floor.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Whoa, what&#39;s that? Is that... lighter fluid or something?
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** It&#39;s lighter fluid mixed with a solution of saliva from various authors and owl droppings.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Christ, and all of this just to turn me into an owl? Wait, let me guess, is it for that &#34;essence&#34; you were talking about?
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** Yes, it is. And would you cut it with the sarcasm? I&#39;m tired of it --
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** And where do you even get all this garbage from? You just go to the zoo and ask for a cup of owl piss --
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** //Enough//. I&#39;m //this// close to throwing you out of here. If you&#39;re looking for me to pay you, don&#39;t get on my bad side.
&gt; 
&gt; //More sounds of liquid spilling on the floor.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** Aaaaand okay, I think we&#39;re ready. Now, I&#39;m going to need you to take off your shirt to properly apply the blood.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Okay... hmm, I&#39;m a little hesitant to go through this. Hey, is this going to hurt at all, me... turning into an owl?
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** It&#39;ll only hurt for maybe half a minute or so, but after the ritual&#39;s done and through with you probably won&#39;t feel a thing. Just stay calm and don&#39;t let the flames get to you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Alright, that&#39;s -- wait, are you going to set me on fucking //fire//? I thought --
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** Stay calm. Get through it, and it&#39;ll be all right.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** //(Hesitantly)// ...Well, I guess it&#39;s worth it for the salary you&#39;re getting me. Fuck, here goes nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; //Voice 2 can be heard struggling to take his shirt off.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** You may now use the blood.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Alright, here we go... guess I&#39;ll ingest the blood first and -- //(Coughs violently)// God, fuck, that //stings//...
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** Go ahead and apply the blood to your chest.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Well... fuck man, give me a sec... 
&gt; 
&gt; //Sound of blood splashing.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** ...Oof, there we are. God, it&#39;s like... it feels like it&#39;s //boiling// on my skin. What the hell&#39;d you put in this...
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** It&#39;s formaldehyde. Now, one last step. Move to the center of the pentagram and lay down. Then, I&#39;ll get you something to hold.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Christ, you&#39;re going to make me lay in the -- owl urine? God, this better work, or else --
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** Shush. There is very little chance of this failing on us, okay?
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** All right, if you say so.
&gt; 
&gt; //Sounds of paper rustling.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** God, it&#39;s sticky and everything... Hey, what are you getting for me there?
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** I&#39;m looking for the sonnet -- ah, there we go.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Thank god.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** ...All right. What I&#39;m going to have you do is recite this sonnet in your best Shakespeare voice while holding this.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Is that a feather?
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** It&#39;s an owl feather.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Wait, it&#39;s all damp... wait, did you -- what did you put it in...
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** Owl droppings.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Yep. Fucking knew it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** Anyway, please, go ahead, read that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Well, all right then. //(Clears throat)//
&gt; &#34;Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
&gt; Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
&gt; Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
&gt; And summer’s lease hath all too short a date --&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** Stop. Stop right there.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** What -- was that good?
&gt; 
&gt; //Silence.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Is it working?
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** Yes, yes, it&#39;s working fine. Now, face down if you like, I need to set you on fire.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** //(Exhales sharply)// Yeah, no fucking way this is gonna work. I&#39;m going to die.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** Stay where you are. This won&#39;t hurt as much if you&#39;re calm.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Oh, fucking Christ, as if I&#39;m gonna be calm in this situation.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** ...Is there anything I can do to calm you down?
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** //(Miffed)// Well, right now, I&#39;m really starting to rethink agreeing to getting turned into an owl.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** Relax, relax. Think of the //fame//, think of the //fortune//. Living a lifetime in the spotlight will most certainly make up for half a minute of pain.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** Okay, okay... when you put it like that... all right, let&#39;s do it. Don&#39;t even warn me beforehand, let&#39;s just... get this over with.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** There we go. Now hold still for me.
&gt; 
&gt; //Sounds of footsteps backing away. Voice 2 can be heard breathing in and out heavily.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** //(Sigh)// Being an owl&#39;s gonna fucking suck.
