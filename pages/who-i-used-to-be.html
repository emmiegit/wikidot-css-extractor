I remember who I used to be.
@@ @@
I used to have fun.

I used to try my best.

I used to learn new things.

I used to always be first in line.

I used to hang out with my friends.

I used to see everything with curiosity.

I used to want to create something different.

I used to lay awake reading books until day broke.

I used to get excited about what tomorrow would bring.

I used to look forward to playing with my toys and games.

I used to talk late into the night with people I could always trust.

I used to swing on the playground and laugh at how high I could go.

I used to think I could always swing even a little bit higher.

I used to pretend I would never start falling back down.

I used to be able to enjoy every second of every day.

I used to be someone that could listen and help.

I used to be ready for anything that came.

I used to be filled with compassion.

I used to be sure of myself.

I used to be content.

I used to be me.
