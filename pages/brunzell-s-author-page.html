+ About Me
My name is (not) Nils Severin and I am an SCP author mainly working with concepts from my immediate surroundings (Scandinavia). I don&#39;t really immerse myself in the different canons on this wiki nor am I particularly active and so I may come of as quite unknowledgeable or out of the loop at points. Because I also read a lot of fiction which is neither sci-fi or fantasy (although that does happen as well, I love //Dune// for instance) that tends to make my prose a little... Dull? Different? I am not sure but it typically doesn&#39;t inspire that much. I&#39;ll be very happy if you interact with me or my stuff here on the wiki.


+ Underread Articles
I do this thing where I look through older and newer articles below a rating of 30 without many comments (or very old comments) and leave a crit just to try and give the article some more attention.

++ This particular time, I recommend reading [[[SCP-4418]]]. 
[[div style=&#34;background:#f3d9d7;padding:10px;margin:5px;padding:10px;&#34;]]
//SCP-4418-1 and SCP-4418-2 begin to dance, with SCP-4418-1 lifting SCP-4418-2 into the air and spinning it in a clockwise formation. SCP-4418-1&#39;s hand appears to pass through SCP-4418-2&#39;s waist, although neither entity seems to notice. Agent LamontÃ© reports hearing muted fragments from Johann Strauss II&#39;s waltz &#34;An der schÃ¶nen blauen Donau.&#34;//

[[tab Music to listen to while writing]]
//Copied from [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-14596256/music-to-write-to this forum post]//

The question of what mood that you find helpful for writing in general is interesting. It all depends on what setting you plan to write. For any type of writing I typically go with romantic classical composers such as [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DG87oy53_zM Tchaikovsky], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jn09UdSb3aAÂ Â Chopin] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiChxN0T2kA Schubert]. 

Depending on the setting, you may use vastly different genres of music. The [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9_twwsWUPk&amp;list=PLwDEuPBgBi4NDcdlZrA-LCU7j-aUXzm_k soundtrack from Zelda: BOTW] as well as the calmer [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhOEn7Xl8as background music of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion] works well for a lot of atmospheric settings. For childish, lighthearted pieces I believe [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxtRYpvJKRc bossa nova] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edXrvZj58SY Yoshi&#39;s Crafted World OST] works quite well. For historical pieces I usually go with old folk, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgSVmRQ8wGc slavic] or [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVMOVhyeDzI nordic].
