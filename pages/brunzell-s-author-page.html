+ About Me
I&#39;m just a Swedish pastry with an interest in writing, reading and teaching. I have a passion for equity in schools and the environment. I like all kinds of articles on the wiki but I generally have a preference against enabling too unrealistic concepts. I know everything on here is hella unrealistic but I believe there is a spectrum as well.    


+ Underread Articles
I do this thing where I look through older and newer articles below a rating of 30 without many comments (or very old comments) and leave a crit just to try and bump the article in any direction toward a more fitting range. Hopefully I have made some articles accepted, and some acknowledged etc. I have without a doubt read more articles below 30 than above.  

++ This particular time, I recommend reading [[[SCP-5229]]]. 
[[div style=&#34;background:#f3d9d7;padding:10px;margin:5px;padding:10px;&#34;]]
//SCP-5229 is an anomalous human skeleton, with the notable structural difference of SCP-5229’s foot bones, hand bones, facial bones, and cranial bones being fused together into solid plates. Due to the particular structure created by the fusion, SCP-5229’s extremities resemble fins, and SCP-5229’s skull resembles an open-circuit diving helmet. The faceplate of the skull is composed of keratin, giving SCP-5229’s “visor” the approximate appearance of a fingernail.//

//Despite being heavily abnormal in structure and appearance, SCP-5229’s anomalous qualities will only manifest in the event that any portion of SCP-5229 is not in direct contact with liquid. When SCP-5229 becomes active, it will proceed to animate, move towards the nearest source of water, and submerge itself, becoming inactive.//

[[tab Music to listen to while writing]]
//Copied from [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-14596256/music-to-write-to this forum post]//

The question of what mood that you find helpful for writing in general is interesting. It all depends on what setting you plan to write. For any type of writing I typically go with romantic classical composers such as [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DG87oy53_zM Tchaikovsky], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jn09UdSb3aA  Chopin] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiChxN0T2kA Schubert]. 

Depending on the setting, you may use vastly different genres of music. The [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9_twwsWUPk&amp;list=PLwDEuPBgBi4NDcdlZrA-LCU7j-aUXzm_k soundtrack from Zelda: BOTW] as well as the calmer [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhOEn7Xl8as background music of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion] works well for a lot of atmospheric settings. For childish, lighthearted pieces I believe [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxtRYpvJKRc bossa nova] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edXrvZj58SY Yoshi&#39;s Crafted World OST] works quite well. For historical pieces I usually go with old folk, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgSVmRQ8wGc slavic] or [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVMOVhyeDzI nordic].
