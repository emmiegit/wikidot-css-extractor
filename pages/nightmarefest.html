[[&lt;]]

&#34;Of course,&#34; you might say. &#34;I&#39;m browsing the SCP Foundation. Of //course// I like horror!&#34; And that&#39;s fair, that&#39;s fair. But nowadays, the SCP Wiki is pretty firmly in the category of New Weird. Horror, while appreciated, is no longer the name of the whole game. Even some of our most popular articles (such as [[[scp-049|049]]], [[[scp-999|999]]], and [[[scp-5031|5031]]]) can&#39;t be called &#34;horror&#34;.

So, again, do you like horror?

You&#39;d do well not to let your sense of fear atrophy. It keeps your senses sharp. Helps you stay alert. Who knows if the pale businessman standing across the street isn&#39;t sizing up your house&#39;s exits? It helps to be prepared.

Fear is also an amazing motivator. It can motivate you to stay healthy: what if you need to run from something? A bear? A ghost? A strange man in a raincoat? What happens when your heart gives out in the middle of the woods, hours from the nearest person? 

Above all else, humans just like being scared. It&#39;s why we love to congregate at our dingy theaters on Halloween, ignoring the growling from empty showings as we pile in for that new horror flick. They say the actors suffered an almost supernatural tragedy during filming; certainly, the characters suffer. But regardless of all that terror, you&#39;re here to have fun.

You know none of it&#39;s real. Sure, the corn dogs taste funny this time around, and the kid at the front won&#39;t stop staring at you, but you&#39;re not in any //real// danger. Would you //actually// come here if you knew too-long sunset shadows were waiting outside to swallow you whole? You have nothing to worry about. You have nothing to worry about. You have nothing to worry about. Pray the posters on the metro walls stop whispering invectives as you ride back home.

But that&#39;s beside the point. There&#39;s a triple feature coming up.

We&#39;d love to have you.

This is //NOT// an official SCP Wiki event. This event is run by [[[scpdeclassified|SCP Declassified]]] staff.

++ The Basics
[[/=]]

You are going to write something that scares the shit out of your audience. Your article must be based on one of the three themes (or &#34;Features&#34;) below. It can be an SCP, a Tale, a GoI Format, whatever -- as long as it hews to the theme and inspires fright.

Entries may be solo endeavors or involve teams of up to three people. Only one entry is allowed per entrant/team. Entries cannot be submitted for more than one category.

Each Feature&#39;s theme is relatively loose; if you can meaningfully apply it to some major aspect of your article, we&#39;ll accept. It could be an aspect of the setting, a reference to a major character or plot-point, a major thematic motif, or even the name of a central piece of media. In general: if it&#39;d fit as an alternate title to your article, it should be alright.

Unlike most writing events, total vote count will not determine the winner; instead, a thread will be opened up during the voting period asking for the &#34;Most Terrifying Winner&#34;. Users are afforded one nomination per category to pick the entry that //really// had them terrified.

++ The Rules
[[/=]]

# You may post __one__ entry per entrant/team, which must correspond to one of the Features listed below.
 * This doesn&#39;t mean your entry can&#39;t incorporate elements of different Features, only that it __can&#39;t be submitted to more than one of them__.
 * Teams may have no more than three members.
# Your piece should be horror of some kind. What &#34;horror&#34; means is up to you.
# Your article can be of any format -- SCP, Tale, GoI Format, whatever -- as long as it breaks no rules.
# Features may be interpreted broadly: you should be able to explain how your piece relates to its respective theme.
 * If you&#39;re still not sure, feel free to consult the event runners.
# Articles must be reasonably new: existing complete drafts or articles previously posted to the wiki may not be submitted.
# Edits are allowed after posting, so long as they don&#39;t completely replace the article.
# No Shenanigans. 
 * &#34;Shenanigans&#34; may include, but are not limited to:
  * Sending excess PMs/DMs to promote your work, to the point of spam.
  * Downvoting your competitors works all at once, or within minutes of each&#39;s posting.
  * Malicious voting patterns (including malicious upvoting/novoting).
   * This includes downvoting something because you believe it doesn&#39;t &#34;deserve&#34; to win the event, irrespective of quality.
  * Encouraging any kind of voting brigade.
 * Plugging your work is //absolutely// allowed, as long as it doesn&#39;t reach the point of outright spam.
 * Shenanigans rules that pertain to voting __**also apply to non-entrants; your nominations will not be counted should you be found engaging in such behaviors**__.
# Once the Most Terrifying Nomination thread is opened, you are allowed __a single nomination per feature__. The entries with the most nominations will win &#34;Most Terrifying&#34; for the category it entered under; please only nominate entries you found the most terrifying on some level.
# Have fun!
# **Tag your entries with &#34;nightmarefest&#34; and either &#34;_townhouse&#34;, &#34;_the-bureaucrat&#34;, or &#34;_graveyard-shift&#34;, depending on your chosen theme.**

**Writing Period:** Sep. 24, 2021 (12:00 AM) - Oct. 31, 2021 (11:59 PM)
**Posting Period:** Oct. 25, 2021 (12:00 AM) - Oct. 31, 2021 (11:59 PM)
**Nomination Period:** Nov. 1, 2021 (12:00 AM) - Nov. 13, 2021 (11:59 PM)

Questions and concerns should be directed to [[*user UraniumEmpire]] or a member of the SCPD Discord moderation team.
