**Item #**: SCP-5177

**Object Class**: --Keter-- Safe

**Special Containment Procedures**: The land surrounding SCP-5177 has been bought and fenced off by Foundation front group &#34;Montepalle-DeBiers Ecological Trust&#34; under the pretense of preserving the habitat of a critically endangered species of owl. No non-Foundation personnel are to be allowed onto the land, which has been designated Provisional Site-347. Researchers of Level 2 Clearance or above who wish to study SCP-5177 may do so with the permission of the Director of Provisional Site-347 (currently Dr. MacPherson).

A candle is to be burning at all times at the centre of SCP-5177.

**Description:** SCP-5177 is a former [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/ijamea-hub|Imperial Japanese Anomalous Matters Examination Agency]]] (IJAMEA) underground complex located on  █████ Mountain in rural Oregon. SCP-5177 contains 3km of hand-dug dirt tunnels, earthen living areas, and camouflaged bunkers. SCP-5177 was originally surrounded by many lethal and non-lethal traps, some designed to retain prisoners.

At the time of containment, SCP-5177 was saturated with a variety of [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/a-brief-explanation-on-demonics|demonologically]]] bound Yokai entities, which have since been exorcised. The techniques used to create these bindings are well-understood by Foundation science, but are beyond the capabilities of the general public. These included: 
* //Raijin//-type entities (Thunder Kami) invoked to &#34;scatter enemy &lt;radio&gt; communications to the wind.&#34;
* //Gaki//-type entities (Hungry Ghosts) invoked to conceal lethal traps and consume the remains of their victims.
* //Buruburu//-type entities (Shivers) invoked to intensify feelings of cowardice and fear in intruders.
* //Kitsune//-type entities (Fox Spirits) invoked to confuse intruders, disrupting navigation and planning.

SCP-5177 has an additional anomalous property active throughout the area, randomly disrupting access to long-term memory.[[footnote]]Any memory more than ~30 seconds in duration.[[/footnote]] Foundation occultists have theorized that after many years of abandonment, SCP-5177 has manifested a unique species of //Yokaius tsukumogami//, or discarded object spirit. Occult containment specialists have determined that a ritual symbol of remembrance is sufficient to suppress this effect throughout SCP-5177, resulting in the current containment procedures.

SCP-5177 was created in the 1930&#39;s by a single IJAMEA stay-behind agent and used to monitor Foundation activities, but this agent departed after an unknown period of time.

**Addendum 5177-21: Discovery Timeline** 
__March 15, 1973__: Foundation Electronic Intelligence agents intercept radio messages originating in the Pacific Northwest containing classified mission-critical Foundation information, including descriptions of SCP objects in containment.[[footnote]]These transmissions were later determined to be repeating and heavily out-of-date.[[/footnote]] Foundation North American Command declare this breach a Class-Aleph threat to the Masquerade and deploy all available intelligence assets.

__March 23, 1973__: Agents K. R. Turner and A. M. Moore, [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/task-forces#iota-10|MTF Iota-10 (&#34;Damn Feds&#34;)]]] members embedded in the U.S. Forest Service, forward rumors of hunting and rescue parties going missing in the vicinity of  ██████████ National Forest.

__March 24, 1973__: Foundation Intelligence intercept FBI Unusual Incidents Unit communique stating that multiple agents had gone missing in the area of █████ Mountain. As the closest assets, Turner and Moore are dispatched to investigate and destroy any sensitive Foundation documents. Local Task Force Echo-5 (&#34;Ski Jumpers&#34;) are placed on alert at [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/secure-facility-dossier-site-64|Site-64]]] as backup.

__March 25, 1973__: Turner and Moore report reaching █████ Mountain but suffer anomalous radio interference. Moore is instructed to switch to backup FoundSATCom reporting system and proceed. Transmission logs are integrated below.

[[span style=&#34;color:red;&#34;]]ARCHIVIST&#39;S NOTE:[[/span]] FoundSATCom allowed one-way tight-beam textual transmission to Foundation Command via early satellite link. Transmission windows only opened every 8 hours, when FoundSAT-3&#39;s orbit brought it within range.

We are about halfway up the mountain, but have to move slowly. Found rotting animal in a pit trap, couldn&#39;t identify. Deer? Traps are not visible. Eyes slide off them. One step at a time.

| 17:30PST
Found a concealed tunnel entrance. Turner cut her leg bad. We didn&#39;t notice until we stopped? Will check tunnels in the morning. Field radio completely useless, leaving it outside.
[[/div]]
 
Based on transmission contents, █████ Mountain is provisionally classified as SCP-5177.

Check. Resting. Think I can hear activity inside, seems like more than wind noise.

| 09:30PST
In the tunnels now. Dirt, narrow, no light. Only fit one person crouching. Trying to preserve flashlight. Have seen a few rooms branch off, supply rooms, sleeping areas.

| 17:30PST
Turner can&#39;t make it far, left her in some kind of living quarters, looked equipped for prisoners. Found documents, some Japanese some Foundation. Looking for water.

This place is a maze, must be going in circles. Can&#39;t find Turner. Suspect spatial anomaly. Have seen other lights moving in the tunnels, but avoiding contact.

hostile force present. mustve saw my light down tunnel, opened fire, automatic weapons. tunnel collapsed, lucky. lost sidearm. keep moving.
[[/div]]

Based on possible spatial manipulation, security threat, and hostile forces, SCP-5177 is classified as Keter. LTF Echo-5 are deployed for retrieval. Containment specialists are scrambled.

Have water. Don&#39;t know how. Can&#39;t find exits. Found Turner again. She&#39;s delirious, asking for Jim.
[[/div]]

__March 30, 1973__: Foundation Intelligence learn that members of 2nd Ranger Division had been dispatched from Fort Lewis at UIU request to secure SCP-5177. Iota-10 members at Fort Lewis report that communication with the rangers was lost 72 hours previously. 

Turner and Moore cannot be reached. LTF Echo-5 cannot be reached. Site-64 Director Hayden White contacts local FBI leadership under the HERA protocol.

No further transmissions are received.

__April 5, 1973__: Foundation and US forces withdraw from SCP-5177. Overall casualties include 1 KIA, 7 injured. Containment is enacted.

**Addendum 5177-41: Containment Updates**
On November 2, 1984, Foundation occultists recommended the current containment procedures. Through HERA liaison, Portland UIU negotiator James Turner asked to be present during the enactment of the remembrance ritual. Based on the suggestion of occult containment specialists, his request was granted.
