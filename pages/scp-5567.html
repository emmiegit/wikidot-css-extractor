Site-23 web crawler Delta-500  (&#34;Discover-Bot&#34;) is to continuously monitor the web for mentions of SCP-5567. Should mentions be discovered, they are to be promptly removed.

Any discovered copies of SCP-5567 are to be kept in Site-23 anomalous storage Unit-12. Personnel wishing to access SCP-5567 with clearance level below SCP-5567/2 must gain permission from project director Researcher Oliver Crane or project lead Senior Researcher Kelly Apple.

**Post 19/12/2019 Additions:** No physical changes may be made to any copy of SCP-5567 upon discovery without direct permission from project director Researcher Crane. Any person found guilty of doing so will be removed from working with SCP-5567, and reported to Site Director Lilith Miles.

**Update 25/09/2019:** Due to the unknown nature of SCP-5567-1&#39;s anomalous development, testing has been temporarily suspended. Only the aforementioned personnel may access SCP-5567.

[[include component:image-block

| caption=SCP-5567 title card.]]

SCP-5567 is a direct-to-video, subtitled, pilot episode of a Japanese anime titled //&#34;海辺の謎&#34;//[[footnote]]Umibe no Nazo; Seaside Mystery.[[/footnote]]. A label on the back cover claims it was distributed by a believed-to-be nonexistent &#34;East Blue Productions&#34;; investigation is ongoing.

The plot of SCP-5567 involves a detective named Toshiro Arikawa (SCP-5567-1) investigating a spike in missing person cases in the fictional seaside town of Michikomio, Japan. Although locals claim a yokai[[footnote]]Monsters, usually ghosts or demons in Japanese folklore.[[/footnote]]  is responsible, Toshiro remains skeptical. Every twenty-four-hours following the previous successful viewing of SCP-5567, the culprit of the disappearances changes, along with corresponding scenes and other details relating to the mystery.

**Discovery of SCP-5567-1**

SCP-5567-1 is an emergent awareness embedded in the character of Detective Arikawa, which developed upon repetitive viewing during preliminary Foundation testing.[[footnote]]As little is known of emergent awareness within the Foundation, study of SCP-5567-1 is considered to be higher priority than of SCP-5567.[[/footnote]]

During testing, SCP-5567-1 gradually became aware of its status as a fictional character. Evidence of this included:

* Dialogue by SCP-5567-1, considered unfitting to the scene
* SCP-5567-1 appearing late to scenes
* SCP-5567-1 not appearing in scenes
* SCP-5567-1 responding to remarks made by Foundation personnel in the room[[footnote]]As SCP-5567-1 only understands Japanese, responses primarily consisted of confusion.[[/footnote]]
* SCP-5567-1 failing to speak for extended periods of time


Testing has revealed SCP-5567-1 is aware of when SCP-5567 is being watched, its place as a character in a direct to video anime, and the year SCP-5567 was supposedly created.[[footnote]]1985[[/footnote]] Additionally, testing has revealed that SCP-5567-1 is aware of previous iterations of itself, interactions with viewers, and plot resolutions. For more information uncovered during testing with SCP-5567-1, see the addendums below.

&gt; //[SCP-5567-1 leans back in his chair and looks to the sky.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5567-1:** The voices in my head seem quite active today. Maybe I should go to a shrink like Aoi tells me to. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Apple:** My name is Dr. Apple, and I&#39;m here to interview you. Next to me is Researcher Fox. Please be more responsive to the questions.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5567-1:** Can&#39;t right now, doc. My schedule is a bit backed up at the moment, what with the murders and all.

Hello Kelly! I&#39;m still landing my footing here, but a useful phrase we have around the office in my division is &#34;a content anomaly is a contained anomaly&#34;. Maybe try using his name, many anomalies cooperate simply by hearing their given name. We need to gain his trust, as he seems very wary around us.

See you tomorrow!

&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** Hello, Detective Arikawa, I was wondering if I could speak with you. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Arikawa:** Jesus, can a man take a smoke in peace? I already told you doc, I don&#39;t want nothing to do--
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** No, no, you misunderstand, sir. I was merely a translator for my supervisor, Apple. My name is Daichi Fox.
&gt; 
&gt; **Arikawa:** Ah. I suppose I could give someone new a chance. Especially since you&#39;re using my  name. My //real// name.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Arikawa takes a deep drag of the cigarette and exhales, watching the cloud drift away.]//

&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** Oh... okay, ah.... How did you feel when you first gained— first became aware of your surroundings.
&gt; 
&gt; **Arikawa:** Shitty.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** Okay... what do you want to do with your life?
&gt; 
&gt; **Arikawa:** Well, I would kill myself, but I wouldn&#39;t know what to do after that. //[takes a drag]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** Not that much of a planner, eh?
&gt; 
&gt; **Arikawa:** What can I say, I&#39;m more of an action man than a thinking man.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Thundering is heard in the distance.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** Not a bad way to be. Aren&#39;t you afraid it&#39;s going to rain?
&gt; 
&gt; **Arikawa:** Nah, it never rains around here this time. A little further down the coast, maybe, but never went out that far. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** Why not?
&gt; 
&gt; **Arikawa:** Heh, I&#39;m suicidal, not insane. Traveled down the coast for a shopping trip one time, halfway to the next town I started unravelling. //[takes a drag]// Could feel ink dripping from my back, the car almost falling apart from the weight of an animator&#39;s pencil pressing against it. I didn&#39;t feel... finished. Turned around like a //[chuckles]// fox with its tail between its legs.

&gt; **Fox:** You say that so casually. That you&#39;re suicidal.

&gt; **Arikawa:** It&#39;s nothing to make a fuss of, not to me.

I read your interview with SCP-5567-1 yesterday. You were not productive, Daichi, and very unprofessional transcript at that. Flowery language does not make a transcript. Talking to a construct about its feelings is getting us nowhere. We need to learn exactly what it can do, and what it knows about it. 

You are poisoning the well of research before we can try and take a drink. Watch and learn from me, Fox.

Kelly, you&#39;re being quite cold. If we gain his trust, he&#39;s more likely to cooperate, at least from what I have picked up on. If I see him closing up, I&#39;ll try to smooth things out next interview you do.

&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** Then why do you still do it?

&gt; **Arikawa:** Just because I&#39;m suffering doesn&#39;t mean these husks have to. It doesn&#39;t feel right to leave things because //I&#39;m// upset.  The least I can do is avenge them, maybe fulfill their spirits&#39; need for vengeance, if only for a little while.

**Interview(s) Summary:** SCP-5567-1 initially expressed irritation that Researcher Fox was no longer interviewing it. It was reluctantly explained that Researcher Fox chose to stop directly interacting with SCP-5567-1. It appeared to take comfort in the fact that Researcher Fox had not been forced to stop interacting with it, finding his reasoning &#34;noble&#34; which aided in its further cooperation.

**Progress as of 09/09/2019:** SCP-5567-1 has been observed to have gained full/near full control of itself and its surroundings. Sapience and anomalous properties seem to be progressing at a steady pace, relative to number of interations SCP-5567 has undergone.

-- Dr. Marvin Waters

**Update as of 12/09/2019:** SCP-5567-1&#39;s sapience and anomalous properties seem to be progressing in larger amounts than previously documented.

New properties include:

* The ability to change which predetermined scene is occurring at will (if it chooses to partake in such scene)[[footnote]]This will physically rewind the VHS[[/footnote]]
* The ability to make objects appear

Additionally, SCP-5567-1&#39;s physical appearance has been altered. It now looks disheveled, opposed to the clean-cut appearance seen previously.

**Updates as of 25/09/2019:** SCP-5567-1 has become almost non-responsive to Foundation personnel. Although no current threat to containment has been made, it has been decided that SCP-5567-1 testing will be brought to an indefinite halt. Contact Researcher Crane or Dr. Apple for any questions regarding this decision.

Did you ever consider that you were putting him in more pain than he deserved? All those times you forced him to talk to you, forcing the tape to play, you forced him to see his friends turn into horrible monsters and ghouls. He saw his friends die over and over.

You made him miserable.

I didn&#39;t mean to.

I tried distancing myself from him as if that would help, but it didn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t want him to be lonely anymore, I thought I could fix that.

Fix him, at least.

I just wanted to help him.

On the 19th of December, 2019, during an unrelated containment breach, the entire site experienced a cascading power failure. After power was restored, it was discovered that substantial modifications had been made to SCP-5567, including the physical removal of a portion of the tape, which included the timestamp that the murders occurred within. It is unknown who, if anyone, is responsible for this vandalism. The emergent intelligence has been unaffected by the alteration.

Researcher Fox put in for a transfer after the above incident, which was granted. Upon vacating his lodgings at the Site, the following correspondence was found.[[footnote]]Translated from Japanese.[[/footnote]]

&gt; Arikawa-San
&gt; 
&gt; While I am sure you won’t get to read this, possibly some member of the research staff will take pity on me and read it to you. I won’t take too much of your time.
&gt; 
&gt; I sincerely apologize to you. While I understand I violated your boundaries, at the time, I felt as if I was doing so for the right reasons. Please be assured that I am no longer a part of the research staff here, and you won&#39;t have to interact with me anymore. I am transferring because I feel I have lost my objective, and want to give you peace of mind.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope someday you will come to forgive me.
&gt; 
&gt; All my love,
&gt; 
&gt; Daichi Fox

Upon locating this correspondence, Dr. Apple requested a full enquiry be made into Researcher Fox’s behavior. The letter was not read to SCP-5567-1.
