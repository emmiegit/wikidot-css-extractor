She got off at the right one, not encountering any obstacles on the way. Quickly, she walked the last fifty meters and, pushing against them with her whole arm, she opened the door under a bright neon sign with a dancing blue skeleton and the words: &#34;Reaper&#39;s Scythe BAR &amp; MAGIC SHOP.&#34; As soon as the quiet ringing of wind chimes hanging above the entrance sounded, she could smell the candles and incense.

Stunned, he took two wobbly steps back so Katrina wouldn&#39;t fall right on top of him. He looked around at his surroundings, panicked. On the stairs leading up, he saw a shadow of a figure who was just reloading a crossbow. Suddenly, he felt he was standing in something sticky.

He wiped his blood-stained soles on a random doormat and ran up the final floor, tumbling breathlessly into his friends&#39; apartment. He didn&#39;t have much time; the hunter could track him down at any moment. He&#39;d heard they had some magical technology for that. He didn&#39;t know if it was true, but he was in no hurry to find out. He pulled out his phone, searched for something in the gallery with trembling fingers, and sent a message back to Lila -- &#34;haha im in danger,&#34; followed immediately by: &#34;hunter.&#34; He began nervously walking in circles around the living room, moving a few times as if in a particular direction, but immediately retreating back to the middle of the carpet. Finally, he collapsed on the couch and hid his face in his hands. He sighed deeply and stood up again. His phone vibrated: &#34;we&#39;ll be right there.&#34; Kacper took three deep breaths and looked at the apartment again. On the altar by the window, besides candles, flowers and magical symbols, there was also a ritual dagger, used by witches to mark a protection circle when working with magic.

@@         @@ &#34;First, please don&#39;t throw slurs around here. Second, by hunting vampires on our block you are violating the Treaty. I would suggest leaving. And preferably lowering that weapon as well.&#34;
@@         @@ &#34;Shit,&#34; muttered the hunter more to himself. &#34;Ladies,&#34; he adopted a fake, sleazy smile, &#34;I appreciate your knowledge of your rights, but &#39;ave you ever thought that you might be in mortal danger? Ya never know with these things, ya think you trust one, and then -- snap! -- and your neck&#39;s done for! Ha!&#34; he laughed again, running his finger along his throat. He then squirmed and shrieked: &#34;Ow!&#34; as Lila pulled out one of his hairs, suddenly appearing behind him.
@@         @@ &#34;You floozy...!&#34;
@@         @@ &#34;This is //our// home. You have no say here. We need evidence of your illegal hunting, and this hair will come in handy for a tracking spell later. I&#39;m sorry.&#34; There wasn&#39;t even a hint of sympathy on Lila&#39;s face, whereas the man&#39;s expression was one of anger and frustration.
@@         @@ &#34;Dammit, okay,&#34; he began, lowering his crossbow and holding out his hand reassuringly. &#34;I&#39;ll get the hell away from you, okay. I admit I didn&#39;t know such ladies lived here; my mistake. Leave the tracking spells and whatnot.&#34;
@@         @@ &#34;Not so fast,&#34; Natalia interjected. &#34;First, tell me how //you// got a lead on the vampires in this building.&#34;
@@         @@ &#34;Ya must be dreaming...! Trade secret!...&#34; the hunter was outraged.
@@         @@ &#34;Okay, in that case, I&#39;m gonna go inside and start preparing the tracking curse,&#34; Lila said.
@@         @@ &#34;No, alright, hold on a minute,&#34; he got embarrassed. &#34;It&#39;s like this,&#34; he coughed abruptly again, &#34;me and my fellow experts found this forum, where those leeches chat. On the so-called deepweb, &#39;f course. So when one o&#39; them bragged that they&#39;d hacked into innocent people&#39;s houses with some kinda fake invitation, we found the addresses they&#39;d unlocked and we split up to stop the bloodshed.&#34; The hunter&#39;s face twisted into a grimace of anger. &#34;But ya can&#39;t stop my mates, ladies, unless it&#39;s some joint conspiracy of yours, and there are baba yagas residing at every address the leeches can suddenly enter.&#34; A new thought flashed across his face. &#34;Well, then, I said it. Can I go now? I have a corpse to clean up on the fifth floor.&#34;
@@         @@ Natalia and Lila looked at each other over his shoulder.
@@         @@ &#34;Just tell us your name and yes, you can go. And don&#39;t make it up, because we&#39;ll find out anyway,&#34; Natalia warned.
@@         @@ &#34;Well... shit.&#34; He fell silent for a moment. &#34;Dawid,&#34; he finally exclaimed, extremely annoyed. &#34;My name&#39;s Dawid. I won&#39;t give ya my last name because ya only asked for //a// name anyway,&#34; he pleaded quickly, just in case.
@@         @@ &#34;First name&#39;s enough, thank you,&#34; Lila commented with a fake smile. &#34;Please, do go,&#34; she ordered, opening the door to her apartment and standing in the threshold, looking expectantly in his direction. The man, glaring down at her, backed sideways toward the stairwell with his hand on the crossbow. He hesitated a moment at the first step, then started running down.
@@         @@ Lila stepped back, letting her girlfriend inside. Upon entering, Natalia noticed two glowing dots in the depths of the apartment. After turning on the light in the hall, they turned out to be Kacper&#39;s eyes, who was huddled with a dagger under a bookcase with an unusually bright blush of fear on his face.
