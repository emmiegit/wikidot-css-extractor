**Item #:** SCP 7770

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** All reported text alterations in the Christian Bibles that includes the detail that the Bride of Christ is a woman instead of a church are to be tend to immediately. Give Class A amnesiacs to whoever read the altered version of the Bible and confiscate the Bibles.

**Recontainment Procedures:** If the doll becomes a human woman, hunt her down and immediately kill her. Give Class A amnesiacs to everyone who ever knew her as a woman. If we are unable to kill her for any reason, convince her that she has Schizophrenia and give her medication to make her more receptive. Contain the doll on Site 19 under the guise that it is a mental facility.

**Description:** SCP 7770 is a female doll that takes the form of a human woman while alive. She comes to life when a person remembers reading the altered Bible that includes the detail that Jesus&#39;s Bride is a woman. Attempting to kill her before everyone&#39;s memories are wiped will make the attempt fail, she can only die after either everyone&#39;s memories are wiped or they are terminated. When she dies, she reverts back to the form of a female doll.  If nobody that are alive read or remembered the altered Bible then God&#39;s Doll will remain the form of a Doll. When she comes alive, she will live out her life as a regular human for the first 18 years of her life. She then will follow the Christian God fanatically and create a destructive cult as Jesus&#39;s Bride for the rest of her life without intervention.

She had created mutiny in the ranks of the government and the SCP foundation and easily brainwashed everyone she meets under the Psychological MARS 2 resistance level. She is however easily convinced that she has Schizophrenia. It is recommended that if she is unable to be killed for any reason, convince her that she has Schizophrenia and give her medication to become more receptive. She is easily contained on Site 19 and doesn&#39;t try to escape thinking it is a mental health facility. This gives her the Safe Class.

**Researcher Notes:**

&#34;No, Dr. Carl! Religious exemptions for destructive cults are not available! You can&#39;t just ask religious exemptions thinking you live rent free let alone for a destructive cult, you know?!&#34;

//-Dr. Light//

**Addendum:**

**SCP 7770-1:** The first altered Bibles was discovered and the SCP Foundation did not find it anomalous yet.

**SCP 7770-1:** A 19 year old woman named Alyssa Baker created a destructive cult with her as Jesus&#39;s Bride, she used the altered bibles as the holy manuscript. It only seemed like a regular religious group so nobody thought anything about it.

**SCP 7770-2:** Mutinies started to rise in the government and the SCP Foundation because if the destructive cult leading the SCP Foundation to take action. Alyssa Baker was gunned down but she didn&#39;t die. Everyone in the cult was gunned down and Alyssa Baker reverted back to a doll. The doll and the Bibles were confiscated for research purposes. Everyone who ever knew Alyssa Baker were given Class A amnesiacs. 

**SCP 7770-3:** When the researchers read the altered bible, the doll became a baby. The researcher was given Class A amnesiacs and the baby reverted back to a doll.

**SCP 7770-4:** A researcher that grew attached to the doll was terminated but not before he dropped the doll off at an unknown orphanage with the altered bible. There was a world wide search to no avail.

**SCP 7770-5:** The doll was rediscovered as an 18 year old girl named Ellie Cooperson. All attempts to kill her were fruitless even though everyone who read the text were given class A amnesiacs, even Ellie Cooperson.

**SCP 7770-6:** She was convinced by the SCP Foundation that she had Schizophrenia and was given medication to be more receptive. She moved to Site 19 which she believes to be a mental health facility.</textarea></pre>
