**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6716 is considered neutralized, though researchers give the probability of a repeat manifestation a high likelihood. As such, there is currently no active containment for SCP-6716, but inactive procedures are preserved below.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Suspended Containment Procedures&#34; hide=&#34;- Re-suspend&#34;]]
SCP-6716 is to be explained under the guise of an atypical but deadly hurricane. Foundation resources will misinform civilians as they are evacuated from the affected shoreline(s) under the cover story of a delayed but impending tsunami, significant reciprocal water shelf, or an exaggerated high-tide. On-ground personnel are to assume the appearance and operation of FEMA[[footnote]]The Federal Emergency Management Agency.[[/footnote]]. Research personnel are to collect data as instructed, as well as discourage civilian occupation or observation of the area for the duration of SCP-6716.

**Description:** SCP-6716 was an unexplained set of weather phenomena that occurred in September 2017 along an isolated portion of the North Carolina shoreline. 

The most notable component of SCP-6716 was a negative surge[[footnote]]The phenomenon of receding oceans, caused by the force of off-shore storms, or impending tsunamis.[[/footnote]] which displaced water from the shore a maximum distance of 0.6 km over the course of several weeks, despite no storms or registered earthquakes in the region at the time.

SCP-6716 also later included the sudden and unexpected development of overcast cloud coverage, at both high altitudes and at ground-level[[footnote]]As fog[[/footnote]], creating low-visibility. This occurred during attempted photography of the area by satellite and drone imaging. Personnel experienced high winds when traversing the area on foot. Installed barometers confirmed that these winds quickly ceased once no personnel were in the area. 

Due to the unusually long duration of SCP-6716, the complete local citizenry was alerted and routed to safety via evacuation routes. Misinformation regarding minor but critical infrastructural damage was widespread to explain the inability for the evacuated population to return in a reasonable time-frame. Doctored media was released corroborating this cover-up. During this time, Foundation personnel were dispatched to the area to further collect information.

Contrary to the law of conservation of mass and energy, SCP-6716 did not result in the destructive return of ocean water to the affected shoreline[[footnote]]This water is assumed to have been dispersed across the Atlantic.[[/footnote]]. Rather, the area was slowly coated in a thin layer of a water-based and soapy liquid that surfaced from the shore and ocean floor. The lost water from the shore was gradually restored as the amount of this liquid accumulated, and both the high-altitude cloud coverage and the fog cleared shortly thereafter.

The resulting ocean water was sampled. Analysis finds no anomalous or unnatural components. A sample of the soap-like substance was also retrieved. Analysis suggests that it is chemically similar to that of commercial hair growth products. 

Two days after SCP-6716 resolved, Foundation researcher Ayman Haj was found wading in the waters of Edenton, North Carolina. He was carrying a plethora of unauthorized Foundation communications equipment[[footnote]]A Mark III ontokinetic receiver to detect any reality fluctuations, a Gassion-Sprit thaumaturgical interface to detect any sigil-based communications, a handheld Pickman Pad to detect any pataphysical messages, a vial of mnestics to detect any antimemetic discussion, as well as a tape recorder, a helmet transceiver, a Rite-In-the-Rain brand notepad and pencil, and a Tamagotchi brand virtual pet. (The significance of the last item is unknown.)[[/footnote]]. 

A portion of an audio log from the tape recorder is reproduced below:

**Haj:** Hello?

**Haj:** Anybody?

//[Splashing]//

**Haj:** What is this?

//[Waves crashing gently.]//

**Haj:** //[shouting]//... LEND ME YOUR SECRETS!!

//[30 second pause.]//

**Haj:** WE ARE THE SAME!! YOU DON&#39;T HAVE TO BE ASHAMED.

//[10 second pause.]//

**Haj:** I&#39;M HERE!! I&#39;M RIGHT HERE DAMN IT!!

//[14 second pause.]//

**Haj:** //[Drawn out, yelling]// COMPLETE ME!!

Haj was eventually retrieved by his team&#39;s assigned security, but was allowed to remain in this state for the duration of the night and the following morning, where he repeatedly submerged the crown of his head both in the water and in the shore&#39;s sand. 

The disciplinary matter was handled internally by his immediate supervisor team, who decided that Haj had &#34;punished himself enough&#34;.
