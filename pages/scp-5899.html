**Item #:** SCP-5899

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5899 is currently housed within a Transmutive-Euclid Humanoid Containment Chamber outfitted with standard amenities for a human. SCP-5899 is to be supplied with 1 kg of plastic once a day. Bovines are not to enter within 500 meters of SCP-5899&#39;s containment chamber. 

**Description:** SCP-5899 is a Laotian-American male, 183 cm in height, who is capable of transmuting matter into organic matter and creatures superficially similar to members of the subfamily //Bovinae//, often with extreme physiological changes (hereafter referred to as SCP-5899-1 instances). To date, SCP-5899 has not created any nonanomalous member of //Bovinae// without significant changes to its physiology.

SCP-5899 was discovered within the town of Dance With Death, California, attempting to transform an individual&#39;s house into &#34;a giant cow.&#34; Subject managed to transform the walls, roof, and several items within the house into creatures resembling different species of bovine. SCP-5899 stated it was doing this to settle a dispute. SCP-5899 and all SCP-5899-1 instances were transported to Site-551 for study. 

SCP-5899 is passive and compliant with Foundation staff, and has agreed to not damage its containment chamber in exchange for a small amount of material to &#34;experiment with&#34; every day. Site Administration has chosen plastic for this exchange.

**Addendum-1:** Abridged Testing Log

||~ Test #||~ Results||~ Statements by 5899||
||1 ||SCP-5899 transformed material into an SCP-5899-1 instance resembling a dairy cow with extremely large horns. Each horn is 3 meters in height and is black in color. Additionally, the instance did not possess a heart and instead had a third kidney in place of a heart. The instance was unable to carry the weight of these horns and died shortly after conception.||&#34;Bah, too heavy. Forgot the heart too.&#34;||
||2||SCP-5899 transformed material into an SCP-5899-1 instance resembling a water buffalo with enlarged eyes and hooves and a smaller mouth. The SCP-5899-1 instance immediately vomited a mixture of stomach acid and blood while falling to the ground. The instance died shortly after.||&#34;Horns are fine but now everything&#39;s all fucked up. Ugh.&#34;||
||3||SCP-5899 transformed material into an SCP-5899-1 instance resembling an African buffalo. Subject had no eyes or mouth, and was incredibly small for a member of its species. Despite this, the subject managed to live for several hours after conception, ultimately dying due to dehydration.||&#34;Much better, much better, I think I got it this time!&#34;||
||4||SCP-5899 transformed material into an SCP-5899-1 instance resembling an unknown species of bovine. The instance had seven eyes, three mouths, fifteen ears and eighty-seven anuses. Instance died immediately after conception.||&#34;Nope, still fucked.&#34;||

**Addendum-2:** Interview Log

&gt; 
&gt; = **INTERVIEW LOG**
&gt; ----
&gt; **INTERVIEWED:** SCP-5899
&gt; **INTERVIEWER:** Agent Jean 
&gt; 
&gt; **[BEGIN LOG]**
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Jean:** Excuse me, SCP-5899, do you have a moment?
&gt; 
&gt; //(SCP-5899 is holding several handfuls of beef, which are purple in color.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5899:** Good timing actually, just got done with my fifteenth batch. I&#39;m skipping creating animals and instead creating meat to see if I can get some beef.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Silence)//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5899:** I don&#39;t think beef would be purple.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Jean:** Would be?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5899:** Yes, what about it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Jean:** I&#39;m confused by what you mean. Uh... we have some beef you can use as reference if you-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5899:** No, no you don&#39;t.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Jean:** Excuse me?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5899:** I&#39;m saying you don&#39;t have beef. I highly doubt you have any, considering it hasn&#39;t been made yet.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Jean:** I don&#39;t think I follow.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5899:** I can tell you that no beef exists in this world right now. If it did, I wouldn&#39;t be doing what I&#39;m doing. That simple.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Jean:** You... don&#39;t believe beef exists?
&gt; 
&gt; //(Silence)//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5899:** You&#39;re one of those, I see.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Jean:** SCP-5899, I&#39;m incredibly confused.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5899:** Listen, I don&#39;t know if I can make you think otherwise, but cows... they don&#39;t exist. They just don&#39;t. There&#39;s no proof. They don&#39;t exist...
&gt; 
&gt; //(Silence)//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5899:** But they //should//. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Jean:** What do you mean by, &#34;they don&#39;t exist?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5899:** They just don&#39;t! But they&#39;re valued by Americans all around the world, for their milk and meat, and if I&#39;m gonna die, I wanna die knowing I did humanity a favor.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Jean:** We have footage and pictures of cows and... well, it wouldn&#39;t take much to just bring one to you.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5899:** Faked. Faked cows. Simple as that. Not real cows, because real cows don&#39;t exist.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Jean:** B-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5899:** Listen, kid, I want cows to exist as much as the next simpleton, and I don&#39;t like saying they don&#39;t exist because I wish they did, but I&#39;m doing my best here, and by giving me the stuff needed to transmute, I can refine the perfect specimen, breed it, and give humanity something to thank me for.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Jean:** A-alright... excuse me for one moment, I need to get something.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5899:** Take your time.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Agent Jean exits the room. Silence for several minutes. Agent Jean returns with a slab of raw beef.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Jean:** Here, here&#39;s some beef.
&gt; 
&gt; //(SCP-5899 takes a look at the beef presented by Agent Jean.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5899:** Why did you bring me a slab of human meat?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Jean:** Wha-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5899:** Either way, I don&#39;t care, I need concentration so if you could leave, that&#39;d be excellent.

//{{Oi, Jean, any luck?}}//

//Nope. He says that beef and cows &#34;don&#39;t exist&#34; and that he&#39;s trying to create them or something.//

//{{Weird. Like, what did he say about the beef you brought him?}}//

//He asked me why I brought human flesh in.//

//{{Huh...}}//

//Yeah, dude&#39;s insane, but not my job to worry about stuff like tha-//

//{{Jean, I need to show you something.}}//

//What?//

//{{Here, let me get my laptop.}}//
