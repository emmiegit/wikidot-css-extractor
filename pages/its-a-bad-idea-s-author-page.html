My first SCP, and it probably shows. This is far from my best work, but I credit its survival to giving me the motivation to keep producing and improving.  I don&#39;t have anything profound to say about this one, mostly because I had no idea what I was doing at the time.

I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s much here to rewrite if I ever want to revisit it, but I keep it around for nostalgic purposes.

Written for the 2020 Exquisite Corpse Contest, posted last-minute. Given the constraints of the contest, I am happy with how this turned out. This is still one of my longest pieces, and it&#39;s probably the closest I&#39;ve come to writing a  &#34;traditional&#34; story/character arc so far. There are concepts and characters in here that I could come back to and continue to develop in future articles if inspiration hits.

This article also has one of my favorite endings I&#39;ve been able to come up with, so there&#39;s that.

Written for CupidCon 2021. I wrote this mostly to push out of my comfort zone. I&#39;ve done character work before, but this piece relies entirely on it. It was a great exercise for both dialogue and character interaction. I owe its success entirely to the help of [[*user HarryBlank]] and [[*user Pedagon]], who sat me down and explained to me the premise of basic human interaction.

I posted this towards the end of the contest so it got a little buried, but regardless of the upvote count, I&#39;m still satisfied with how this turned out.

Written for the SCP-6000 Contest. 

This is a lot of things. When I was approached by my coauthor [[*user Ralliston]] and asked to help him write a political comedy to rip on Poland for several thousand words, we were both skeptical of whether or not we could make it work. We decided to scrap the idea on the grounds that it would be too ambitious. 

I&#39;m glad we got to rip on Poland anyway. 

This hits on a lot of personal notes for me regarding the relationship we as a society have with nature. We took a rather straightforward approach to the concept, having nature slap humanity in the face for its abuse towards it. The Foundation here is almost irrelevant in the big picture; it&#39;s merely a stand-in for society as a whole. The idea to have the story be told from the perspective of an alternate Foundation helps to accentuate this, I think. The Foundation in this story can be anyone. We all have it in us to do either good or evil. 

All that aside, this was a blast to write. Credit to [[*user Ralliston]] and [[*user Trotskyeet]] for coming up with the majority of the content here. Will we regret taking the Sirenhead slot? Only time will tell.

My Art Exchange for [[*user KirQ]]. 

This was meant to serve as the aquatic horror piece I&#39;ve always wanted to do, but then it turned into something not-quite-horror somewhere in the writing process and I&#39;m okay with that. This was meant to possibly serve as a springboard for future articles in a similar setting, so I left a lot of things to expand upon if I ever get around to it.

I&#39;ve had an iteration of this story in my head for the better part of five years--this is far from everything I wanted to get out, but it was enough to make me feel comfortable putting it out as a complete package. It&#39;s a combination of wiki inspiration and personal fears bottled into a classic cult horror story. Lovecraft took cephalopods so I took cetaceans. 

Expect more from this setting.

Written for the 2020 Canon Renaissance Contest. My first tale, and a huge one at that. This might look like a monster, but most of its length is in dialogue or image sprites. This would not be possible without the help of my amazing team. CRADLE&#39;s character design is not //entirely// my own, as I brainstormed much of it with my team, but it was so fun to put together such a unique character.

The finale to the Limited Memory series, set in the [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/aiad-homescreen AIAD Canon]. While I only wrote a small portion of this specific piece, but I am blown away with how it turned out. The blend of media, visuals, and text throughout the whole series, much of which was done by [[*user Placeholder McD]], is phenomenal, and I&#39;m proud that we were able to create something with a similar level of charm and character as the original AIAD series.

I saw a fish once. It was all slippery and slimy, and I kept wondering how it could breathe through all that mucky water. Gross. I picked it up and tried to grab it but it kept slipping out of my bare hands.  Most of the people had left the beach by then, and the sun was just starting to go down. The sky was purple fire and the water was warm.  I stripped naked and waded into the ocean. I kept walking forward. Walking, not swimming. Even as the sand slipped deeper and deeper, and I felt the slippery skin of fish on my toes and skin, I didn&#39;t look back. Water covered my head and filled my lungs. My hands grew webs between the fingers and my legs shriveled and died. I was baptized. Then I wrote this tale.

A man living in the fishing hamlet once told me a story of how the fish in the sea came to fill Earth’s waters. He told me all the fish were born inside the belly of a great big whale. Biggest of them all, with the arms of a man. Some called it the One Great, and it held all life in its stretchy maw, its hunger satiated because there was nothing else to stuff itself with. One day the fish became restless, and they thirsted for freedom, for air, and for light. They wanted to eat, hunt, fight and kill and survive. They wanted to evolve. And so they chewed a hole through the belly of the One Great and burst like a sore across the vast blue lakes, anguishing in the hateful sunlight. Then the man threw out his net and pulled in a bright twinkling fish and took a bite from its flank. He smiled with bloody teeth and pulled down his shirt collar to show three tattooed gill lines on his throat.  The thing about the sea though, he said, is that it never dies and it always remembers. From the whale’s mouth we came and to the whale’s mouth we shall return. The sea will claim you back. And then he  leapt into the black bay water and disappeared from sight.
