**About Me:** Hello, and welcome to my little corner of the wiki! I go by many usernames, but you can just call me Fluffy. It has always been a dream to write for this beautiful and dark universe. I&#39;m thankful that people have enjoyed my work, and that I&#39;m even able to take the honor of having an author page in the first place.

In terms of my writing style, I usually like to write shorter pieces. I try to think of weird concepts and scenarios that would fit well into a cohesive narrative. While the articles I have made so far are on the shorter end of things, I do plan on making more ambitious articles down the line as my writing skills improve. 

I also never completely outline or plan out anything I write, which I think is both a strength and a weakness of mine. 

One thing I&#39;ve learned from writing for this site is that if I don&#39;t have fun writing something, it probably won&#39;t survive on the site.

**SCP Articles:**

[[[SCP-5801|SCP-5801]]] - Snowman Heaven
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Commentary&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]
This was my first successful SCP article, and it surprisingly got a lot of upvotes on the day it came out. While writing this article, I learned how to properly tell a cohesive narrative with a beginning and an end with the SCP format. I&#39;m overall proud of how this one turned out. It was a great achievement both as a milestone in getting my first thing on the wiki and as a learning experience. While there are things I would definitely do differently looking back, I feel the article stands well on its own.

[[[SCP-5809|SCP-5809]]] - GG EZ GET CARRIED (Jamcon 2021 Day 1 Entry)
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Commentary&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]
I had so much fun writing this stupid thing. The idea of making fun of toxic tryhard gamers in an SCP article had already been swarming in my head, and this recent Jamcon gave me the opportunity to write it. The chat logs were directly inspired from experiences I&#39;ve had playing multiplayer video games. People are fucking toxic for no reason man, especially in League of Legends. Overall, I&#39;d say this article turned out exactly as I imagined it, and therefore I am really proud of it.

[[[SCP-5378|SCP-5378]]] - Eternal Sunshine of the Spotted Beetles
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Commentary&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]
This is probably my strongest article in terms of conveying a strong narrative in a small amount of words. It&#39;s funny because I never thought that I would be able to to write a pathos/emotional article, but I ended up writing one as the fifth thing I&#39;ve written on the site! I&#39;m happy that the majority of people enjoyed it, and that it was able to be on the front page of the site in the Reviewer&#39;s Spotlight section for a while.

[[[SCP-6240|SCP-6240]]] - An Absence of Light (Deptcon Collab with [[*user crystalmonarch]] and [[*user nyelo]])


**Tales/GOI Formats:**

[[[The Death of an Arcadian|The Death of an Arcadian]]]
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Commentary&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]
This was both an assignment for school and a tale for the site. My Creative Writing teacher was kind enough to let me write for the site as well as for her class. The prompt was to have a story involving only one character in one room, and it had to be less than 500 words long. [[footnote]]I kind of cheated by having the main character kill somebody in the very beginning of the tale, but I asked my teacher about it and she said it was okay lol[[/footnote]] I decided to make this tale centered around the GOI Arcadia, as it was pretty dry of new content at the time. Overall I&#39;m proud of how this one turned out, although there are some prose-related things I might want to change later.

[[[A Culinary Broadcast|A Culinary Broadcast]]]
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Commentary&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]
This was another assignment for school that was also for the site. The prompt was to make a writing piece that digresses itself, and it had to be less than 600 words. Being distracted as I usually am with other stuff, I procrastinated on this assignment and had to write it the day it was due. I knew I wanted to do a VKTM piece at some point, so I figured I could make one for that assignment. So, I hit up [[*user Grigori Karpin]] at night and asked him to take a quick look after I wrote it. He gave me some valuable feedback and said that it was site-ready as soon as the tweaks he recommended were made. I&#39;d say I&#39;m pretty proud of it since I was able to come up with a load of symbols and an entire monologue in such a short amount of time.
