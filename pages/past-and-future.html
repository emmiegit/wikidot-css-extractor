     The crunching of leaves underfoot betrays the arrival of a man in the forest, and the spirits within begin to grow wary.  These woods have not seen another traveler in many months.  The chirping of the birds falls silent, and the woods become deathly still.

     The intruder seems not to mind the warnings of his surroundings.  In fact, he is too engrossed in the ripped journal page he is holding to pay any mind to his circumstances.  The manuscript he holds is dwarfed by the size and strength of the hands clutching it, and all attention is focused on deciphering the script which is written upon it.  The man is so absorbed within this page that he nearly trips over an abandoned shield on the path ahead.  As the iron buckler skitters to the side, he snaps to attention and leans down to investigate the dirt upon which he is standing.  Poking out of the soil, a glance of silver catches his eye.  In one deft stroke, an elegant, albeit tarnished, silver sword is pulled from the ground below the man’s feet.  Such physical challenges had never been anything more than a trivial affair for the man. He chuckles to himself heartily.  It seems he has yet to lose his touch.

    As the man grumbles to himself, he leans down to remove a shovel from his pack.  At this point, it is no longer a question of if he will find what he is looking for, but how quickly it will be until he has located his prize.  

    Each shovel swing dislodges more of history.  In one, a rusted dagger.  Another, a bundle of rope, left to fray and disentangle its windings below the ground.  In the third strike, an innocuous leather-bound notebook is dislodged.  The book is, at this point, caked with the dirt and mud of months below the earth.  Nevertheless, the hulking figure leans down to hold this small volume in his hands.  He closes his eyes, whispers some words beneath his breath, and the poisons of earth and time fall from the notebook as if they were raindrops falling from a great oak.

     “If her sword and shield were found here, this must be her notebook,” the figure thought, “and with her notebook…”  
     His thoughts trailed off.  He had been tracking her notes, chasing leads, and following dead end trails for months.  Faced with what he had been searching for this whole time, his mind was racing.  Valentina Eckhart was one many had seen, and few had recognized.  She, and her journal, were known among the circles of traveling historians as a great source of information, as some sort of adventurer&#39;s compendium of knowledge and experience.

    Powerful legs lifted an equally large body to its feet.  The figure could only hope this was not the final resting place of the one who had left this notebook here, but he held no delusions of optimism in this matter.  With cautious hands, he opened the leather-bound book to its first page.

Personal Journal Of Lieutenant Valentina Eckhart, of Tuskini

    **If found, please return to:** If you have found this journal, this means one of two things.  It could mean you have killed me.  If this is the case, please deposit this journal on my body and leave it as such.  Alternatively, you could bring this journal to the nearest settlement and leave it there in a conspicuous enough place.  I am certain it will find its way to its next destination eventually.  Now, if you have killed me I expect you will probably not follow these instructions, but it was worth trying.  
    
     On the other hand, if you have not killed me, you are probably an Awoken, one of the silver veins, who has traced my path through the lands and found my final destination.  In this case, I implore you to continue my work.  You will find a travel log in the following pages. If you can and they are still alive, try to contact my companions Saoirse and Eshyr.  Saoirse, the Veil Piercer, is a tracker of great renown.  Her trail may be a difficult one to follow, but these writings should lead you there.  Eshyr, as a powerful mage, will likely be much easier to locate.  Assuming he follows through on his quest to locate the Custodian, he should be found in the same location.  They are to be trusted, and if they are suspicious, show them this journal.  If you are part of neither of these groups, leave this journal undisturbed, as it holds nothing of value for you inside.

     Should you be an Awoken who has encountered my final resting place and discovered this journal, but do not know who I am, I should  give you a summary of who I am and why I am have written this log.  My name is Valentina Eckhart.  I was born in the lower echelons of Tuskini, to an average farming family.  I was destined for greater things than working the land, and graduated from the local military academy after four years of training.  I became a city guard for the duke until relieved of my duties through his death and the death of his son, and began to adventure with Saoirse and Eshyr.  After an event involving a godly being and the exchange of information, I became infected with an accelerated case of wormrot.  I almost perished, but an infusion of vampyric blood saved my life before I could fully be consumed.  The rest can be figured out from my writings.

I give you my best biddings.  Go and do what I could not.
Your predecessor, Valentina Eckhart

     The man picked up the sword and the notebook, gave a wry smile to nobody in particular, and began to follow the trail once more.
