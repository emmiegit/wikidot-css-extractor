**Item #:** SCP-ES-158

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All congregations of SCP-ES-158-1 specimens shall be placed under observation and hidden from the public. A group of 6-7 armed guards will be deployed near the congregations and an outpost will be placed for bureaucratic purposes.

Due to the nature of SCP-ES-158-1 instances, any experiments with SCP-ES-158 or -ES-158-1 instances must first be approved by the congregation to which they belong.

Due to SCP-ES-158-Foundation Treaty **(See Addendum-ES-158-2)**, a symbiotic relationship has been established between them, where the Foundation provides assistance to SCP-ES-158-1 instances and the latter provide food for various Sites and Areas located in Chile and Peru.

**Description:** SCP-ES-158 is a subspecies of //Solanum tuberosum// (//potato//) tentatively designated as //Solanum braumium// and currently widespread in Peru and Chile. SCP-ES-158 differs from //S. tuberosum// in:

* Growth of 5 aerial stems arranged spirally one above the other.
* Inflorescence randomly distributed among the stems.
* Flower petals with yellowish bioluminescence.
* No seed growth.
* Single-phase electric current production capacity of 600-800 watts/second. In addition, it has an electrical conductivity of up to 220 amperes. Once this amount is exceeded, SCP-ES-158 will begin to wither.
* Produces between 10-15 SCP-ES-158-1 instances. 

SCP-ES-158-1 instances are sentient, sapient, autonomous and speech-capable beings, physically similar to potatoes. As for their average size, they grow to an average of 6-8 centimeters.

All specimens have flexible buds arranged in such a way that they form limbs. The lower extremities are a group of buds placed one after the other forming a ring, being these between 10-12 buds and with flat and hard ends. The upper limbs are composed of two buds, longer and thicker compared to the lower limbs, with terminations that divide the buds into 5 further buds and which present hairs that allow them to hold objects.

SCP-ES-158-1 instances have no nervous system, instead, they form a hive mind, using the SCP-ES-158 specimen from which they were born as their nervous system. Any action on an specimen will be perceived by the other offspring of the same SCP-ES-158 instance. All the specimens, although possessing different memories and personalities, share a decentralized memory that they call &#34;The Stellar Fruit&#34;[[footnote]]Note the difference between this network and the use of an SCP-ES-158 instance as a memory reservoir. &#34;The Stellar Fruit&#34; functions like the subconscious for the humanity, and it is for this reason that dreams in SCP-ES-158-1 instances are taken seriously.[[/footnote]].

There are no detectable biological processes in SCP-ES-158-1 instances beyond biological degradation. Each individual has an opening analogous to a mouth. Within these, there is a tongue-like appendage that regulates incoming air, descending through a tube into a series of spirals that expel air through small holes around the specimens.

No specimen possesses senses analogous to those of animals; instead, they possess the ability to perceive changes in temperature and humidity at a considerable level for their self-preservation. Unlike normal potatoes, each specimen has an average lifespan of 4-6 years and, although they do not have an immune system, they seem to possess the ability to disseminate (and cleanse from their system) pathological agents that affect them through their lower limbs, which are temporarily rooted to the ground. This same mechanism is used for feeding, absorbing nutrients and nitrogen from the soil. It is not currently known where the elements absorbed by the specimens are transported to, although the most correct hypothesis at present is that of an indirect feeding to the mother plant[[footnote]]SCP-ES-158 specimens from which SCP-ES-158-1 instances are born. Children of a SCP-ES-158 specimen cannot be considered children of another specimen; instead, SCP-ES-158-1 instances usually designate each other as &#34;siblings&#34;.[[/footnote]] due to withering when there are fewer SCP-ES-158-1 specimens.

Although they do not possess a digestive or excretory system, they have a hole in the center of the rim formed by the lower limbs. Their excretion consists of warm mashed potatoes as feces; a potato-flavored nutrient juice containing high levels of vitamin C, riboflavin, thiamin, niacin, and other potato proteins and minerals as urine; and vegetable oil produced from the fat of the specimens as sweat. **(See Addendum-ES-158-2)** 

Through interviews, it has been possible to confirm the existence of 3 sexes: male, female and //umellas//; each instance has an 80% chance of being born female or male, and 20% chance of being born umella. Although it exists, sexual dimorphism is minimal. SCP-ES-158-1 male instances can be differentiated by their dark exodermal hue, while females by their yellowish hue. The umellas have a grayish hue and tend to be more spherical than the other instances. 

Relationships between the sexes are complex, and although there are no sexual relationships per se, there is an analogue designated as an SCP-ES-158-A Event. **(See Addendum-ES-158-1)** 

SCP-ES-158-1instances are able to relate to each other and form groups. For detailed interaction between instances, see Addendum-ES-158-1.

+++ **Social summary**

&gt; Like humans, SCP-ES-158-1 specimens usually form tribes around the same SCP-ES-158 mother instance and its offspring. There is a cultural system of its own among offspring of the same mother and, so far, a transaction system consisting of nutrients and nitrogen is known as a currency for trade relations between tribes, i.e. exchange of leaves, building materials, fertile land, technology, SCP-ES-158-1 instances, weaponry, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Tribes build houses made of leaves and mud. Although their structure does not allow them full flexibility, they use different extendable and gripping tools for their purposes, as well as the use of thaumaturgical methods of construction, mainly used by elders.
&gt; 
&gt; Culturally, the entities present a cryptolanguage based on Spanish with minor grammatical [[footnote]]Using Subject-Object-Verb instead of the SVO organization.[[/footnote]], spelling [[footnote]]Literal spelling of sounds, e.g.: mágico as in májico.[[/footnote]] and syntactic [[footnote]]Such as the use of the endings -pa, -pe and -po to refer to masculine, feminine and umella/universal gender, instead of the endings -o and -a and the use of the masculine ending for universal.[[/footnote]] alterations. In addition to this, descendants of the same tribe, known as lineage, present endings in their names as a surname, and together with their cryptolanguage, there are common names such as: Fineluj, Caclinaz and Difanate. Currently there are 3 major lineages known as the Triat lineage (in Peru), the Irara lineage (in the north of Chile) and the Rorromaní lineage (in the south of Chile)[[footnote]]In this case, the &#34;lineage&#34; designates a group of individuals who share given sociological and historical relationships, therefore, any individual can join a lineage if absolute loyalty to it is pledged. [[/footnote]].
&gt; 
&gt; Due to the non-existent sexual dimorphism, males, females and umellas can develop in any physical activity like the others. There may be the possibility that some instances may be born with abnormalities, such as not having any limb, deformities beyond the normal, rotten pulp, etc. In such a case, the other specimens of the same tribe will take the initiative to, under a rite to the //Stellar Fruit//, proceed to the disembowelment and subsequent consumption of the sacrificed specimen.
&gt; 
&gt; There is an internal hierarchy, the children (between 1-2 years), the adults (between 3-5 years) and the elders (between 5-6 years). The older they are, the more power they have over the tribe, as they are considered wiser.
&gt; 
&gt; Theologically, the instances perform monthly worship to their mother plant, designating each of them as Nenupo [NAME], Nenupo being analogous to Saint. The members of a tribe respect the mother plants of other tribes and believe that they are all on a higher plane in a never-ending orgiastic event, and which is the one who bestows energy upon them. Due to the birth of SCP-ES-158 instances, the entities see the birth of these as a sacrifice for the existence of their brethren and an apotheosis.
&gt; 
&gt; As a sign of adoration towards the mother plant, the specimens perform SCP-ES-158-A. Please note that the following events only take place in open terrain.

**Excerpt from an interview with a SCP-ES-158 instance regarding its culture.**

&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Alejandro Jimenes (designated as //AJ//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewee:** SCP-ES-158-1-65 (Sidre[[footnote]]Analogous to Señor in Spanish or Mister in English. Shortened as Sd.[[/footnote]] Comurrí-Irara, designated as //Alpha//)
&gt; 
&gt; -----------
&gt; 
&gt; **AJ:** All right, then... I&#39;ll be straight with you, Sidre Camurri. Let&#39;s see, could you tell us about your village?
&gt; 
&gt; **Alpha:** Ah, my people //(Sighs)// You see //(Pause)//. We are a lineage that has lasted for many years, you know? Since the time of Columbus. //(Pauses and looks around him)// //In fact it was thanks to the Europeans that we exist//. That&#39;s how our great sages say it! We come from their magnificence. Yes!
&gt; 
&gt; **AJ:** Your magnificence? So are you telling me that you come from some... //royal family// or something like that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Alpha:** Oh, no. We come from the Great Star Grotto, my good man. You see, in the beginning we were born of the Star Seed, and we made up 5 tribes. But... //(Pause)// For some reason, the fifth was forgotten //(Confused)// //We only know that it was a bunch of necromancers.//
&gt; 
&gt; **AJ:** So have they always existed separately? Have they ever tried to unite into a single //tribe//?
&gt; 
&gt; **Alpha:** It&#39;s... it&#39;s a long story. Let&#39;s say there was a schism during the Colonization, yes, indeed, we know of human history. It was around the year 264 of our birth[[footnote]]The first SCP-ES-158 instance is currently dated to have been born in a region of Chile, during the 17th century. According to SCP-ES-158-1 instances, its civilization is 418 years old.[[/footnote]], the Normenites united with the Triat, forming the Great Direnota nation-state, to the south //(Points to the right)//, under the Tototepor [[footnote]]A place located at the foot of the mountains in the Peruvian Andean Mountain Range.[[/footnote]], while the Rorromaní went south. We maintain relations with the Ro, but //(Pause, grimaces indifferently)// the Triat really suck.
&gt; 
&gt; **AJ:** Let me see then, why do the Triat suck, according to you? And more to the point, why did you split up?
&gt; 
&gt; **Alpha:** Differences of nataeo [untranslatable: belief, dogma, way of life], and I hope you understand the word. The tribes that rose up remained as lineages, and the lesser tribes belong to some lineage.
&gt; 
&gt; **Alpha:** The Triat believed in orgiastic union among their inhabitants, giving way to frenzies of any kind among them. The Rorromaní, on the other hand, believed in the pre-mortem celibacy [act where only two elderly subjects can have sexual relations], the Bedmes[[footnote]]A way of life developed by the Rorromaní where sexual development is constant, implicit and subtle. No physical relations are maintained at any time, but a psychological link to different sensations and thoughts. [[/footnote]] and nurturing their Nenupo with wisdom? Yes, many of our rituals differ. //(Pause, look at the wall of the interview room for a moment)// We are the &#34;most normal&#34;... let&#39;s say. We&#39;ve been fairly well researched by now.

+++ **SCP-ES-158-A Event**
 
&gt; SCP-ES-158-A is an event that occurs in different ways and pairs SCP-ES-158-1 specimens of different sexes, i.e., there are female-male, male-male and female-umella relationships[[footnote]]Male-male, female-female or umella-umella relationships may end in an SCP-ES-158-B event.[[/footnote]]. SCP-ES-158-A events only occur between a SCP-ES-158-1 specimen in its terminal stage of life and a young adult specimen (3 years). Depending on the relationships, SCP-ES-158-A may elapse in the following ways:
&gt; 
&gt; * **Male-Female:** Instances will proceed to root in the soil and slowly sink to a depth of 10 to 20 centimeters. After several hours, a stem will begin to grow out of the soil, giving birth to a new SCP-ES-158 specimen.
&gt; * **Male-Umella:** Instances will proceed to raise several of their buds and introduce them into each other. The male individuals will then proceed to endow the umella individuals with their pulp until they die of malnutrition (lack of pulp).
&gt; * **Female-Umella:** The umella instance will proceed to insert its buds into the female instance, starting to push from the inside out, managing to tear the female instance apart. This will cause several male specimens to also introduce their buds into the umella specimen and end up consuming its pulp, killing it by malnutrition.
&gt; 
&gt; Any attempt to impede or disrupt SCP-ES-158-A will be reproved by SCP-ES-158-1 instances, claiming that &#34;//it is the event of their life//&#34; or &#34;//anyone would kill to be in my position//&#34;, resuming the event later.

&gt; //[RESUMING INTERVIEW]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Alpha:** Let&#39;s see, that information is a bit incomplete. 
&gt; 
&gt; **AJ:** That&#39;s what we&#39;ve seen, isn&#39;t it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Alpha:** That&#39;s true. There are the events that they call SCP-ES-158-B, but, they differ between the major lineages. For the most part, they occur as you say, but for the Triat there is no real difference, they exist for this. There is //(Pause, hesitation to speak)//, an orgiastic feast among their children, many new Nenupor [see that the -r denotes plural] are born. The descendant lineages have managed to endure, but still they go and make the greatest Nenupor of all our race... //They are almost trees.//
&gt; 
&gt; **AJ:** And it is only they who act differently? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Alpha:** There are nuances between each tribe, For the Rorromaní, uh... let&#39;s say, there are few of their Nenupor, and the few that they have are sacred. They are danadapor [untranslatable: fanatical, very adoring, drooling]. They don&#39;t really care too much about this //sex// thing, but they have learned the art of ednada [untranslatable: enjoyment, joy], which means they don&#39;t end up killing themselves. You know what happens to us.

---------

+++ **SCP-ES-158-B Event**

&gt; A taboo behavior has been observed among tribal members. This behavior is the relationship between males-males, females-females or umellas-umellas. Each of these relationships results in two SCP-ES-158-B events:
&gt; 
&gt; * **Event 1:** Multiple specimens will congregate around the pair. These instances will begin to throw dirt toward the couple and run around them, expressing displeasure toward them in the form of swearing. The instances will use their buds to systematically pierce the pair until they turn them to mush. Made mush, by means of a thaumaturgical ritual, the congregation will proceed to erase from their memory the existence of the couple, but without forgetting the occurred event.
&gt; * **Event 2:** The couple will sink into the ground. After being completely sunk, an explosion will take place, scattering pieces of both specimens around.

&gt; //[RESUMING INTERVIEW]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Alpha:** Yes, this at least happens with us. But this is more of an impulse exerted by us. For the Triat, in fact, not performing these pairings will result in //SCP-EN-158-B// events, and male-male and female-female relationships are analogous to male-umella and female-umella. Umella-umella relationships can give new Nenupor.
&gt; 
&gt; **Alpha:** The Rorromaní are just like us, but in fact they only admit male-female relationships... uh, yes. Umellas in their land are in fact almost non-existent. They are born there, but they migrate. Several Rorromaní lineages accept umella integration, but they are not too many.
&gt; 
&gt; **AJ:** So, what is biological &#34;sex&#34; for you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Alpha:** Well, //sex// is a relative thing. That&#39;s how, at least, you guys have put it to us. The males and the females, naravopar and nirevopir. The umellar. The naravopar and nirevopir are there to reproduce. The umellar are there as a way of transmitting energy to the Qued [untranslatable: great, solemn] Nenupor. Sex. It is more mental than physical, not like you. The umellas are not //more// than us, in fact, we are all on the same side, with our Nenupo. The Nenupo.

**Addendum-ES-158-2:** Food Request of SCP-ES-158-1 Instances 

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Show Log&#34; hide=&#34;- Hide Log&#34;]]

&gt; **From:** marianaquerano@scpf.com
&gt; **To:** ronaldlopez@comite.etica.com
&gt; **Subject:** Usage Request
&gt; --------
&gt; Greetings, Mr. Ronald,
&gt; 
&gt; for the past year, my team and I have been conducting tests on the nutritional levels offered by SCP-ES-158-1 specimen waste. It is not pleasant, but, considering that it is possible to create many kilograms of mashed potatoes and nutritional supplements from some specimens, and the null presence of anomalous activity, it is a request to consider for supplying our food reserves. Below, I attach a file with the research carried out by my team in this regard.
&gt; 
&gt; //[/scp-es-158# scp-es-158-1-waste.pdf]//
&gt; 
&gt; I look forward to hearing from you,
&gt; Mariana Querano, Cryptozoology Division of Site-118.

&gt; **To:** ronaldlopez@comite.etica.com
&gt; **From:** marianaquerano@scpf.com
&gt; **Subject:** RE:Usage Request
&gt; --------
&gt; Miss Mariana Querano,
&gt; 
&gt; We have taken your request into account and, although the Ethics Committee has been divided on the matter, we have come to the conclusion that it is possible to use the residues from SCP-ES-158-1 instances for the supply of multiple Sites and Areas in the areas of Peru and Chile.
&gt; 
&gt; The order has been given to maintain a symbiotic relationship between the instances and us, granting them fertile soils and sufficiently removed from civilization for their reproduction and settlement.
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely yours,
&gt; Ronald Lopez, Envoy of the Ethics Committee for Hispanic American Affairs.

**Incident-ES-158-1:** Triat-Irara War

On 10/20/2018, a declaration of war from the Triat was made known through the Irara. Attached below is an interview conducted with Sidrech Gram-Triat (member of the Triat).

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Show Interview&#34; hide=&#34;- Hide Interview&#34;]]

&gt; **Inverviewer:** Dr. Mariana Querano (designated as //MQ//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Inverviewee:** SCP-ES-158-1-102 (Sidre Gram-Triat, designated as //Beta//)
&gt; 
&gt; -----------
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Interview&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **MQ:** Greetings, Sidre Gram-Triat, komólove [untranslatable: most courteous greeting].
&gt; 
&gt; **Beta:** My greetings, Gogopí Querano. Have you heard what has happened lately?
&gt; 
&gt; **MQ:** Absolutely. //(Pause)// I just came to ask you some questions about it. Tell me... this war, why?
&gt; 
&gt;  **Beta:** The light, Miss Querano. //(Looks at the ground)// Neerg Taerg is our new God, Miss. //(Extends his lower limbs to the ground)// We no longer follow the word of Quenal-Uin[[footnote]]Considered the first matriarch and prophetess of SCP-ES-158-1. After her death, she was venerated as a saint.[[/footnote]]. And we all know the relationship that the dirty Irara and the Rorromaní have with us, we disgust them. But we were always one people, eh? That&#39;s what Quenal-Uin wanted, but, desperate times.
&gt; 
&gt; **MQ:** I don&#39;t understand, what do you mean by &#34;desperate times&#34;?
&gt; 
&gt;  **Beta:** You see, Miss. //(Returns to his original position)// When we were created, our lineage was supposed to be greater than all animals and all humans. Ours were eaten when they were taken across the sea. Few survived, and a few others settled. Today we know nothing of them. And here we are, //another one in this world//.
&gt; 
&gt; **MQ:** That doesn&#39;t explain anything about this war, why start it now? Why didn&#39;t it happen in the past?
&gt; 
&gt; **Beta:** Because we can, //Miss Querano//. //(1 minute pause)// But we really don&#39;t want to destroy any race... we want to move forward. But, it is not possible to move forward without an union.
&gt; 
&gt; **MQ:** I will be as sincere as possible with you, in order to gain your trust, but, don&#39;t you think, that your lineage is the least suitable for a revolution of such caliber?
&gt; 
&gt; **Beta:** Oh, what are you saying, that the Rorromaní should do it? //(Visibly annoyed)// Those useless people who don&#39;t fuck like us!? //(Calms down)// No, of course not. Neerg Taerg has said so //(Again extends his upper limbs to the ground)//. The vigorous Triat shall take over the lands of the Potapor[[footnote]]Way to call SCP-ES-158-1 instances in their entirety.[[/footnote]]. There is no precedent in our race. But, your books, those of you, your books say that out of chaos wonders can be born. As can we. //(He grimaces with a smile)//
&gt; 
&gt; **MQ:** What I said, you have no idea how to proceed with this war, do you? Do you know what you will do after devastating the land of the Irara?
&gt; 
&gt; **Beta:** Of course I do. You see, I had a dream. A dream in which Neerg Taerg appeared to me...
&gt; 
&gt; //Beta pauses for 5 minutes, MQ resumes the conversation.//
&gt; 
&gt; **MQ:** That doesn&#39;t explain much, what did you see in your dream?
&gt; 
&gt; **Alpha:** I saw... out of a salty river //(Begins to pronounce rapidly)// There were multitudes of creepers, like an octopus, coming out of it; and m-more behind it a golden throne. Laden by palms of great boughs. From, from their palms, de- dropped two fruits. On one side, a [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-es-041 mango]. Sweet, tasty, fleshy, filling. On the other, a coconut. Bitter, semi-liquid, pu-putrefying. It could kill anything, go through anything. It left a gorge of rot as it descended beneath the sand. And Neerg Taerg stood before me. He was giant, he surrounded me and with a thousand voices, he spoke to me. And, and, and...
&gt; 
&gt; //Beta pauses for at least 10 minutes, looking carefully at the ground as it trembled.//
&gt; 
&gt; **MQ:** And then what happened...?
&gt; 
&gt;  **Beta:** //(Calm voice)// It surrounded me. It embraced me. The sky radiated as it rained, and the grounds began to turn brown, perfect for harvesting. He told me about the smoke from the fire; about the death of thousands of grazti [untranslatable: plant, trees]; about an old man in the bowels of the world. How everyone served him for the common good. And how my people would never starve and how no people would make us bend.
&gt; 
&gt; **MQ:** I guess the dream didn&#39;t get there, did it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Beta:** Of course not. //(Takes his upper limbs off the floor and looks at MQ)// After that, I could see how the tangle of vines was //sitting// on the throne and how he was pointing at me and telling me that I should follow him. But, it wasn&#39;t a request, it was a mandate...
&gt; 
&gt; **MQ:** A divine mandate, you say?
&gt; 
&gt; **Beta:** No, I don&#39;t understand it at all. //(Looks down)// He was offering me things, but more than an offer, he was telling me I had to follow him. I don&#39;t get it. //(Looks up at MQ)// But he, he was scary, I couldn&#39;t say no. And then a multitude of [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/testimony-of-an-initiated green-goblins] appeared, and they told me about many civilizations that had followed Neerg Taerg and how they had advanced. How he entwined himself in each of their lands, and how he sought new subjects for the plague he called The Inorkanika. A lifeless plague come to kill all the children of his race. Then I saw a flash of green, and I could see....
&gt; 
&gt; //Beta pauses again for 5 minutes.//
&gt; 
&gt; **MQ:** Hey, Sidre. What happened? What did you see?
&gt; 
&gt;  **Beta:** //I could see my brothers...// //(Pause, hesitates to speak)// rotting, turning to stone. The Nenupor withered, and the great dancing orgy returned to earth, only to be consumed by the Inorkanika. How the Stellar Fruit was consumed. //(He stops and pleads with MQ)// Please help us, I don&#39;t want to see my brothers fall. I don&#39;t even want to see the filthy Irara and Rorromaní fall... //We were never created to hate each other//.
&gt; 
&gt; **MQ:** I understand, Sidre. We&#39;ll try to do the best we can.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Interview&gt;**
&gt; ----------
&gt; **Conclusion:** After the conversation with Sidre Gram-Triat, an agreement was reached with the Triat lineage to cease hostilities against the Irara. To date, this treaty is still being honored.

**Addendum-ES-158-3:** Discovery of the Nilrem

On 02/26/2019 Site-118 was informed about an antimemetic condition affecting the villagers of [REDACTED], a rural town in western Bolivia. They reported not remembering a potato field noted in several written documents and topographic surveys. As a result, two agents were administered W-Class mnestics and released on the spot.

After 3:00 p.m., the agents found a previously undiscovered old plantation in an open field. The agents reported the presence of houses similar to those built by SCP-ES-158-1 specimens, but no SCP-ES-158-1 specimens were present. Also, about 10 instances of SCP-ES-158 were sighted, 9 of which were withered.[[footnote]]These were in a state of decomposition, but through genetic testing, they were linked to SCP-ES-158.[[/footnote]].

Inside the houses, scrolls written with the same language used by copies of SCP-ES-158-1 were found. It should be noted that most of the houses had scrolls of thaumaturgical and esoteric nature. Among the most remarkable texts, rituals were found for metabolic manipulations, plant growth, building structuring and mnemonic and informative manipulation, the latter were found together with another series of texts, detailing how to use them when, quoting a text fragment:

&gt; //... Are extinguished. When the fires are lit. When we rot in iron and copper. Or when the Great Patapor Nation rises up.//
&gt; 
&gt; //We exist, we will exist. Even in their memories.//

It is hypothesized that the site once functioned as a settlement of SCP-ES-158-1 instances belonging to an undiscovered lineage. It is known that this lineage was named as &#34;Nilrem&#34;, as this name appears repeatedly among the scrolls found, referring both to the place of settlement and their advanced knowledge in thaumaturgy, culture and history.

Further research is ongoing.
