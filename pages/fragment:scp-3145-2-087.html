    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Item #:** SCP-3145

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3145 is to be contained in situ within SCP-3145-1. The access door to SCP-3145-1 is to be constructed of reinforced steel with an electro-release lock mechanism. The outside of the door is disguised as a janitorial closet, while the inside is lined with 6 cm of industrial foam padding.

Due to the results of Exploration IV, no personnel are permitted to access SCP-3145-1.

**Description:** SCP-3145 is an entity of unknown properties, appearing as a pale humanoid face with no visible pupils, nostrils or mouth. From limited observation, it is known that SCP-3145 is hostile to human life and capable of leaving gouges in solid stone. It does not seem to be able to force exit of SCP-3145-1, but the possibility of its escape cannot be allowed. Subjects encountering SCP-3145 exhibit signs of intense fear and paranoia, though it cannot be ascertained whether these reactions are natural or anomalous.

SCP-3145-1 is a platform staircase with no known endpoint. Stairs descend at a 38 degree angle for 13 steps before reaching a semicircular landing approximately 3 m in diameter. Light sources are required for exploration, as no light fixtures or windows are present, and the design of SCP-3145-1 limits visibility past 1.5 flights. As SCP-3145-1 seems to absorb light, light sources stronger than 75 watts have proven to be ineffective.

Subjects exploring SCP-3145-1 report the sound of a young child in distress from somewhere below, confirmed by audio recordings. The source of this sound is reported to be approximately 200 m below the initial platform; however, no amount of descent has brought subjects any closer to said source. The depth recorded during Exploration IV surpasses what should be physically possible for the structure and its geological surroundings.

**Addendum: Interview 3145-01**

&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-3145
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Dorcas Falzon, Head Researcher, SCP-3145
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** During the Exploration III of SCP-3145-1, SCP-3145 was seen to peer into the camera. It then began speaking. Dr. Falzon was present during the event, and facilitated communication.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log, 19:27&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3145:** Hello? Anyone there?
&gt; 
&gt; **Falzon:** SCP-3145, can you hear me?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3145:** Ah, it&#39;s you, Doc. Yeah, I can hear you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Falzon:** What it is you want?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3145:** Um, how to put this? I want more explorers.
&gt; 
&gt; **Falzon:** Excuse me?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3145:** More D-Class. You know. Like the crazy chick you sent down here to sneak around. I really got her with that busted step, but I gotta say, the rate you send these poor bastards in is lousy. I&#39;m getting bored down here!
&gt; 
&gt; **Falzon:** SCP-3145, we are not going to needlessly sacrifice more personnel just so you can kill them.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3145:** Aw, c&#39;mon! Think of it like a challenge. She got way further down than any of the others. I&#39;ll even give the next one a head-start, say... Fifteen flights? Maybe twenty! I mean, I hardly even have to do anything to spook them once they&#39;re locked in, and just as long as we&#39;ve been talking, I&#39;ve come up with like, two more ways I could try and kill them. It&#39;ll be fun!
&gt; 
&gt; **Falzon:** This is not what I could consider fun.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3145:** Well, maybe not for you. But since it&#39;s kinda dark and that kid won&#39;t shut up, y&#39;know, options are limited. I might actually get tired of this one pretty soon.
&gt; 
&gt; **Falzon:** If you desire better accommodations, they can always be arranged.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3145:** //[sighs]// Yeah, maybe I should just move on. Unless you&#39;re gonna try another exploration, that is.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log, 19:33&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Exploration IV was undertaken on ██/██/████. Following the events of this exploration, no further explorations have been authorized.</textarea></pre>
