----
//Agent Woodlock, Duke, fourteen Nu-7 operatives, and Captain Michaels are all seated as they are being deployed. THETA-1 encounters some turbulence as it flies toward the target. Thunder crackles outside.//

&gt; {{Dozens of reports are being received all at once.}}

//As the team is rocked back and forth, they ready their equipment.//

**Cpt. Michaels:** Men, tonight we are riding into Hell.

//The sounds of guns cocking are heard; rifles and sidearms are all being loaded and prepared. Lights inside the vehicle rotate, shining red.//

**Cpt. Michaels:** Tonight, we are going to end this charade once and for all.

//Two more helicopters - Designated THETA-2 and THETA-3 -  fly in close by, followed shortly by a plane - THETA-4. All units carry separate teams of Nu-7 operatives.//

**Cpt. Michaels:** Tonight, we will tear down these demons.

&gt; {{Accounts being filed detail both major disturbances.}}

//The teams pass through Turkish borders.//

**Cpt. Michaels:** Lock them up tight!

//Crowds have formed around the target below.//

**Cpt. Michaels:** And lose that fucking key!

//The group rallies. The helicopters begin their descent.//

//Gunner seats are taken up onboard THETA-1 and THETA-3.//

&gt; {{News coverage of both incidents is underway.}}

&gt; {{Attempts at shutting down either feed are underway.}}

//THETA-4 rapidly descends, opening its back door and releasing an aerosolized amnestic agent down unto the crowd below.//

//Captain Michaels leans into the group.//

**Cpt. Michaels:** Agent Mortimer here will be joining us, lads. Do not underestimate the devils we will be slaying tonight. This man lost two teams to them.

**Agt. Woodlock:** And I won&#39;t lose another.

**Cpt. Michaels:** Attaboy, soldier!

//All THETA teams prepare their gas masks.//

&gt; {{German officials take notice of the event.}}

//As THETA-1 descends through the clouds.//

&gt; {{Turkish news feeds are being jammed. Shortly after landing, agents from THETA-4 move in to deal with the civilians and the police.}}

//The active Bagger 288 vehicle comes into view.//

Bagger 288 Excavation Vehicle.
[[/div]]
[[/div]]

//Atop the first tower, SCP-3580 watches as Foundation forces enter the area. Hanging from the second tower, SCP-3580-A watches the THETA units as they enter the scene.//

//SCP-3580-A lets go, falling for seventy meters as it crashes down onto the steel platform. It takes a moment to rest before bringing its gun into position and aiming at the incoming THETA teams.//

//It opens fire, targeting THETA-2. All units engage in evasive maneuvers.//

//THETA-2 rapidly flies up and away from the target, rotating around the Bagger 288 as it takes multiple hits. Once it exits SCP-3580-A&#39;s range, SCP-3580-A refocuses on THETA-3. THETA-3 turns, facing its side towards the anomaly as gunners return fire, and closes in at an angled vector. One agent is killed during this, forcing THETA-3 to rapidly ascend while maintaining cover fire.//

//THETA-1 then turns and attacks in conjunction with THETA-3. They pepper SCP-3580-A from both angles. SCP-3580 leaps downward, catching itself by impaling the Bagger 288 with its sword while sliding down the tower.//

//It lands and gets in front of SCP-3580-A, manifesting a large thaumic shield that absorbs the incoming rounds. This holds for a moment, showing signs of damage after six seconds, and shattering after nine. By this time, SCP-3580-A has seemingly recovered and gets in front of SCP-3580. Its back is shredded as it absorbs the munitions. A roar can be heard from both THETA units.//

**Cpt. Michaels:** Hold it! Hold your fire! We need them back alive!

//THETA units cease shooting and close in. THETA-2 operatives dismount on the ground as THETA-1 operatives deploy on the Bagger 288. THETA-3 maintains its aerial position and the situation from above.//

//Half of THETA-2&#39;s agents move toward the control room at the base of the complex while the rest assist THETA-4&#39;s team in dealing with the crowd of civilians, multiple of whom are seen videotaping the incident.//

//THETA-2 moves in three groups of three, Captain Dodger taking the lead. As they approach the central station, they stop as they hear laughter from above. The groups all stop and disband, taking up nine different positions on the ground while watching the sky. Several seconds later, they spot a figure descending, jumping between the walls of the Bagger 288 before it leaps toward them.//

//THETA-2 immediately opens fire after identifying the figure as SCP-3580. It evades these by near-instantly creating a thaumic portal along its trajectory and placing the other end behind one of the agents. A smoke screen of dust forms a second after it is seen executing the operative from its impact with the ground.//

//The rest of the agents fire on the cloud, taking a moment before they notice SCP-3580 behind their group.//

----
= **//Up Top//**
----
//With Captain Michaels leading the charge, THETA-1&#39;s team moves up towards the stationary SCP-3580-A, which overlooks the conflict going on down below. They encircle it and take aim as Captain Michaels approaches it.//

**Cpt. Michaels:** Put the gun down, big guy. No more good people need be hurt.

**SCP-3580-A:** Though you are right, I am afraid I cannot do that.

**Cpt. Michaels:** Fine then. No hard feelings.

//He holds his hand up, signaling the group to await his command.//

**SCP-3580-A:** I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.

//It promptly walks off the platform.//

//A massive clang can be heard from below them, and THETA-1 moves in to investigate. They spot nothing, and back away from the ledge. Another clang can be heard below them, followed by another. The sound begins to emanate from below their feet. Agents aim at the platform, holding their positions as they wait for several silent moments.//

**Agt. Duke:** Captain Michaels?

**Cpt. Michaels:** Back up. Spread out.

//More sounds can be heard beneath them, noticeably shaking the ground on which they stand. All agents move out in a circular pattern. The Captain holds his hand out, gesturing for silence, and they all wait.//

//A burst in the ground is formed, and the Captain signals for all agents to fire. They all target the spot in the platform, penetrating the exterior and making it through to the hollowed machine cavern beneath. Without warning, the platform some eight meters away quickly bulges and shatters open, revealing SCP-3580-A&#39;s Gatling gun, which blindly fires on the group as it emerges from the ground.//

//Five agents are terminated in this attack. Agent Woodlock is nicked by a stray round across his leg before he can take cover.//
----
= **//Down Below//**
----
//SCP-3580 continues its assault on THETA-2, continuously blocking each shot fired at it with thaumic barriers as it presses forward. By now, only four agents remain in this half of the unit, which desperately try to back away from the anomaly.//

//Captain Dodger reaches for her communicator and speaks into it, calling for aerial support on their location. THETA-3 descends and orients its gunners to face the battlefield. SCP-3580 pauses its attack, looking up at the incoming helicopter as the remnants of THETA-2 make distance from it.//

//Both subjects maintain their positions for a moment, neither moving, both intently watching the other. The gunners aboard THETA-2 take the initiative, opening fire on SCP-3580 after four seconds. It sprints forward, somehow outrunning the gunner&#39;s line of fire. It dashes into a slide, creating a thaumic portal with its hands before reappearing in mid-air, delivering a gliding kick to one agent and sending him careening from the vehicle. It grabs ahold of the vehicle&#39;s landing gear and swings itself inside in one motion.//

//It refocuses on the rest of the operatives in the helicopter.//
----
= //**Up Top//**
----
//THETA-1 is down to nine operatives, all of which are scattered, taking turns peaking out from cover, throwing multiple stun and regular grenades at it, or shooting at it when able. Despite all this, SCP-3580-A shows little sign of slowing down as it charges through a steel wall, grabbing one agent by the head and using her body to attack the other one there. THETA-1 is down to seven operatives.//

//Agent Woodlock, alongside Captain Michaels and another operative, hides behind an overhanging junction in the metallic terrain several meters wide. Above them, a series of flashes can be seen overhead, accompanied by a blood splatter as bullets spray past them.//

//Captain Michaels reaches for his communicator and commands the remaining agents to prioritize evading SCP-3580-A. While he does this, the body of Agent King collapses onto their cover, dripping blood and viscera down onto them as her skull has been eviscerated. Woodlock stares at this sight for a moment. He is seen hitting the wall beside himself repeatedly, leaving a noticeable imprint on it. Over the radio, the voice of Agent Duke can be heard.//

**Agt. Dule:** Captain! Christ, it just-

//His shouting can be heard from outside the radio. Woodlock checks over their cover, despite Michaels&#39; protests, and looks out across the Bagger 288. Over on the opposite end of the platform, he watches as SCP-3580-A grips Agent Duke in its hand, rearing back its other arm.//

//Woodlock grabs his rifle, taking several shots at the back of its head as he runs in at incredible speed. Watching this, Captain Michaels orders the rest of the team to fire on it at the same time from all angles. SCP-3580-A is momentarily stunned while this happens, still holding onto Duke, as Woodlock runs up to it, knife in hand.//

----
= //**Down Below//**
----
//The four remaining agents of THETA-2 return to the scene, running past the bloodied terrain as they make their way back to the control center for the machine with their newly cleared path. Captain Dodger directs them forward, staying behind and looking up as THETA-3 is overrun. She signals her communicator and commands the other half of THETA-2 to return to the helicopter and fire on SCP-3580.//

----
= //**Up Top//**
----
//Agent Woodlock impales SCP-3580-A in the side with his knife, twisting it deep into the crevice of its waist joint. It tries to bat him away with its gun, but he yanks the knife out, drops it to the ground, and catches its arm with both his hands, visibly straining as he does so. It turns its head to him, looking at him for a moment, before tossing Agent Duke away and taking a swing with its gun.//

//Woodlock dodges this, moving under its incoming arm and rotating around to its back. He takes his rifle from his own back and points the barrel at the armor plating on its head.//

**Agt. Woodlock:** Don&#39;t move a fucking muscle!

//He grits his teeth as he speaks. Agents have ceased fire, moving to better points around the two cautiously.//

**SCP-3580-A:** Fine, I will not. But your friend may be another story, presently.

//Woodlock turns his head slightly, not moving the rifle from its place, and watches as an injured Agent Duke struggles to hold himself up from falling off the platform some six meters away. He turns his head from Duke to the rest of the team, still running towards them from twenty meters away.//

**SCP-3580-A:** Your comrades will not be able to hold me for long. You know this. Your Foundation will not tolerate you killing me. You know this. What is your decision?

//He hyperventilates for a half-second before turning his rifle to the back of its knee, firing once and tossing away the gun as SCP-3580-A drops down on its back. He runs after Duke and reaches out for his hand a moment after Duke had already slipped and fallen.//

//He leaps over the edge, holding onto the platform with one hand, and grabbing two of Duke&#39;s fingers and a thumb. With the aid of his enhancements, his grip on Duke&#39;s hand remains strong enough, in conjunction with his other hand, to swing Duke upward and back onto stable territory. Duke screams throughout this procedure[[footnote]]As the option for augmenting operatives of Sigma-8 was voluntary, Agent Duke refused this offer, citing a firm disbelief in the Church of the Broken God.[[/footnote]].//

//The other operatives of THETA-1 immediately try to get behind cover as SCP-3580-A stands and extends its gun toward them. Above, THETA-3 can be seen entering the shot, hovering above SCP-3580-A with its gunners reared.//

//Inside the cockpit, SCP-3580 can be seen piloting the aircraft.//

**Cpt. Michaels:** Hit the deck!

----
= //**Internal View//**
----
//Inside THETA-3, Junior Researcher Fallen can be seen emerging from a crevice in the back from the body cam of a downed agent. He wears a leg prosthetic and looks around at the mess of sixteen dead operatives. He hyperventilates, falling to his rear whilst trying to avoid stepping in anyone. His head bobs back and forth between one sight to another, before staring straight ahead into the broken door of the cockpit. He grabs an assault rifle from one of the dead.//

//He moves forward, rifle raised, visibly shaking. He reaches for the door with the barrel of the gun but gets slammed into a wall as the helicopter jerkily ascends, shaking the door out of the way as THETA-3 rises above the Bagger 288. He struggles to his feet and pushes forward, stepping into the flight deck where SCP-3580 can be seen staring at the conflict down on the platform below, giggling.//

//He raises the rifle and instantly takes a shot, piercing its chest and sending it sprawling onto the controls of the vehicle, disrupting only minor systems. It turns back to him, sword swiftly raised.//

**SCP-3580:** You. You survived.

**Jr. Fallen:** Oh, you fucking remember me now?

//He breathes heavily before firing at the seat beside it.//

**Jr. Fallen:** You deserve to die for what you&#39;ve done!

//It chuckles at this. He fires another round into its leg and it stops.//

**Jr. Fallen:** What the fuck are you laughing at? How many f-fucking lives have you taken for your pride?

**SCP-3580:** That sounded familiar, is all. Tell me, how long will you continue to carry that vendetta with you, everywhere you go, in everything you do? What are you willing to lose?

//Fallen takes a deep breath, leveling the gun with its head.//

**Jr. Fallen:** Whatever it takes.  

**SCP-3580:** Very well. It&#39;s not like that&#39;s going to do you very much good now.

//It gestures behind him with its fingers. He takes a quick glimpse, turning back to SCP-3580, before fixing his eyes properly on the threat behind him.//

//THETA-2 flies in from behind and moves up to be side-by-side with THETA-3. The pilots within THETA-2 look through the windshield on THETA-3, seeing SCP-3580 as it stands to its feet. By the time Fallen can look back at it, it draws its sword and begins assailing him.//

//With his augments, Fallen barely manages to keep up with SCP-3580 as it slashes at him wildly, using the rifle to block the incoming attacks. He backs away for a moment, getting pushed back into the main cabin of the vehicle where he attempts to hold his ground. He clumsily swings the gun like a club. He gets slashed on his remaining leg, then again on his arms, and once along his ribs.//

&gt; THETA-2 calls for permission to terminate THETA-3.

//SCP-3580 kicks Fallen in the stomach, knocking him onto his back. He pulls his rifle into position and aims just as it waves to him and drops out from the helicopter, free-falling away. Fallen crawls over to pursue it, firing repeatedly after it, missing every shot. It creates a portal and disappears from sight.//

//He crawls back into the cabin and shuts the doors, laying on his back to breathe for a moment before dozens of rounds pierce the hull of THETA-3. Fallen curls into the fetal position as these shots pepper the helicopter before they stop. THETA-3 experiences major turbulence and begins descending rapidly. Fallen tries and fails to get to his feet amidst this.//
----
= **//Down Below//**
----
//The remaining members of THETA-2 gather around the control consoles of the Bagger 288, tearing through the chamber in search of a way to shut it down to no avail. All of the controls are written in German.//
----
= //**Up Top//**
----
//SCP-3580-A sprays the entire platform, fortunately not hitting any of the operatives hidden behind cover. It continues this barrage for several seconds, walking forward as it does so and coming closer to Captain Michaels&#39; location. It walks four steps, each covering about a meter and a half, before stopping and turning back towards THETA-3 as it remains stationary.//

//Agents manage to hit it repeatedly while its back is turned. It does not react to this, instead watching as THETA-2 flies in and takes THETA-3 down. It reaches for its wrist and kneels down.//
----
= //**Aerial View//**
----
//Fallen struggles to be seated in the pilot&#39;s chair as he tries to take control of THETA-3. The helicopter drifts downward while he tries to pull up on the handle, only managing to reangle it slightly on its crash course.//

//THETA-3 glides downward and onto the platform of the Bagger 288 with SCP-3580-A in its path; it does not flinch, even while being pelted from multiple angles. As THETA-3 collides with the metal framework, SCP-3580-A dashes and sprints toward it. THETA-2 intercepts this by flying closer in and firing a short burst at it, buckling its knee and preventing it from reacting in time.//

//THETA-3 crashes through SCP-3580-A, breaking most of the frontal hull of the vehicle, before the remains of it flip over it and skid to a stop multiple meters away. This impact creates a short smokescreen that follows THETA-3 and briefly lingers around SCP-3580-A. When this clears, SCP-3580-A can be seen collapsed on the ground, its Gatling gun severed, most of its body badly damaged.//

//Agents move in to secure SCP-3580-A while Woodlock goes after THETA-3. He tears the door away and steps inside, pausing momentarily to react to the gore, searching for life signs amidst the bodies before moving in and heading for the cockpit. Inside, he finds an injured Jr. Fallen.//

**Woodlock:** Leon? What are you doing here?!

//Fallen speaks faintly.//

**Fallen:** H-hey, Captain.
----
= //**Up Top//**
----
//SCP-3580 appears from a portal on one of the Bagger 288&#39;s towers. It descends quickly and rushes over to SCP-3580-A&#39;s side. It quickly executes two agents, getting shot more than once along its way. It crouches down beside SCP-3580-A and creates a variety of symbols with its hands, which channels a thaumic dome around both of them. The body cam of a downed agent inside this barrier picks up the ensuing conversation.//

**SCP-3580-A:** Pro- x- im- a.

**SCP-3580:** Warden, how were you bested?

**SCP-3580-A:** You must go.

**SCP-3580:** The gate, Warden-

**SCP-3580-A:** -The blood we have spilled exacts its price.

**SCP-3580:** I&#39;ve heard enough of your bleeding-heart bullshit, Warden, now stand and fight!

**SCP-3580-A:** The lives you take, Proxima. You must learn to temper yourself. Moving on like this, it will only lead you to misery and regret. The Order knows that, but they use you anyway. He is selfish, he does not truly care for you. He will not care for me.

**SCP-3580:** How does that help either of us right now?

**SCP-3580-A:** Because if you survive this, you would do well to remember my final words. I would appreciate that, at least.

**SCP-3580:** What are you doing?

**SCP-3580-A:** I am sorry, Inquisitor.

//It stands and rears back//

**SCP-3580:** No, stop! Don&#39;t you dare!

//SCP-3580-A charges through the barrier, shattering it instantly, before breaking past the lines of agents and beyond. It runs across the Bagger 288 platform, ignoring every hit. THETA-2 hovers over it and opens fire on it again, staggering it for a moment before it can regain composure and continue.//

//It jumps down from the platform and onto the lower part of the machine, running down the framework towards the blade of the digger. Its voice can be heard over SCP-3580&#39;s wrist.//

**SCP-3580-A:** Farewell, Run.

**SCP-3580:** Cascade!-

//A moment later, an explosion erupts from SCP-3580-A that ripples through the framework, shaking the entire structure as the combustion grows in size. This causes the sawblade to dismount from the machine and halts its progress.//

//SCP-3580-A is terminated.//

//The explosion continues throughout the vehicle, causing the entire system to tremble as parts of steel break off, bend, and warp in reaction to the newly missing segment of the Bagger 288. One of the towers crashes down and falls while the other is held in place by the support beams alone.//

//SCP-3580 sits motionless, watching the ensuing chaos. Operatives refrain from immediately opening fire, distracted by also watching the terrain as it rapidly destabilizes. Captain Michaels calls THETA-2 to pick them up. Agent Woodlock walks out of THETA-3, carrying Fallen with him to the rest of the group.//

**Agt. Duke:** What do we do with her?

//Captain Michaels, Agent Woodlock, and the rest of the operatives turn to watch SCP-3580 as it reaches out toward the missing section of the machine. Its sword lies a short distance away. Woodlock sets Fallen down and he speaks, though very faintly.//

**Jr. Fallen:** Sh- sh- oot.

**Agt. Woodlock:** Let her burn. We need to get out of here.

**Cpt. Michaels:** The young agent&#39;s right. That demon is going back to Hell with lead in its head. Boys! Aim!

//The remaining operatives turn their guns on SCP-3580, excluding Woodlock and Duke.//

**Cpt. Michaels:** Fire!

//It turns to face them for a moment before near-instantly creating a thaumic portal on the ground beneath it. It falls through this just as the agents pull the triggers. THETA-2 arrives just behind them.//

**Cpt. Michaels:** Goddamn it.

//The body cam of a downed agent picks up as SCP-3580 crashes into the ground. A loud crunch is heard as one of its metal prosthetic arms is crushed. It shouts in agony, crawls onto its back, and lays there.//

//It tears off the damaged piece and tosses it away, grabbing at its exposed shoulder where blood pours out. Eventually, it manages to get to its knees as it vocalizes in pain. It tries to stand but collapses as it finds that its leg is broken. It remains there on the ground, clutching its injuries with the damaged but still functioning prosthetic. Grunting and wailing are heard.//

//After some time like this, it notices the body of the agent and turns onto its stomach, crawling towards the camera. As it gets there, it snatches some things from the operative&#39;s corpse. It tears off a piece of cloth to apply tourniquets to its wounds, it ties the stock of the agent&#39;s rifle to its leg to act as a splint, and it uses the rest of the gun as a makeshift walking stick.//

//It tries to stand again, this time with some success. It then begins making its way over to the front of the area - the opening formed by the Bagger 288. There is audible weeping as it passes by the microphone.//
----
= //**Internal View//**
----
//Inside THETA-2, all agents are being treated for their injuries as the pilot hovers around the target, searching for SCP-3580. Woodlock is seated beside Duke and Michaels while an unconscious Fallen is being operated on onboard THETA-4.//

**Cpt. Michaels:** That young agent showed some remarkable talent to be the only man to walk out of that helicopter. You two have any idea who he is?

**Agt. Woodlock:** Someone who wasn&#39;t supposed to be on this mission.

**Cpt. Michaels:** Well, I guess it&#39;s a good thing that he came, then. Stopped that lunatic before she could turn our guns on us.

**Agt. Woodlock:** And he got himself hurt going after it.

**Cpt. Michaels:** It was bold.

**Agt. Woodlock:** It was reckless and self-centered. A whole helicopter down, how many good people gone for fuck-all... this was a fiasco.

**Cpt. Michaels:** They died serving their duty. It&#39;s part of the job, Morty.

**Agt. Woodlock:** //The job.//

//He mumbles.//

//THETA-2 flies over to the newly created ravine at the Eastern end of the scene. After a moment, they observe a small figure shambling towards the mouth of the cavern as it begins drawing a portal incantation.//

**Cpt. Michaels:** Target sighted!

//Duke, Michaels, as well as the rest of the team, save for Woodlock, watches while descending as SCP-3580 travels to the bottom of the ravine and begins creating another thaumic spell.//

**Cpt. Michaels:** Take us down there now!

**Pilot:** We can&#39;t, sir! It&#39;s too narrow!

**Cpt. Michaels:** Jordon, Jamison, guns, now! Do not let it escape!

//Before the agents reach the gunner seats, SCP-3580 completes the ritual. A portal opens, and the contents of the bottom - which are blurred from this distance - disappear.//

//SCP-3580 looks up and puts one hand up, giving THETA-2 the middle finger, before stepping into the gateway and disappearing from the scene.//

SCP-3580 currently remains at large.

The chasm created during the prior incident revealed a large underground temple-like structure, filled with overgrowth of various unidentified species of flora. A review of both the current state of this place, as well as compiled THETA footage, revealed that a large structure in its center appears to now be missing.

Ongoing Veil protection operations are in effect. Despite this, however, international tensions have risen between Germany and Türkiye, with Germany claiming that Türkiye had stolen the Bagger 288, and Türkiye claiming that Germany had invaded its territory and planted the vehicle there being heavily debated in international courts. The Foundation has opted to deny all claims of its involvement during this time until a working explanation can be devised.

A memorial for all personnel killed during this incident will take place on the 28th. All of these agents have been individually awarded with Foundation Stars of Bravery.

The following message was sent to all personnel assigned to SCP-3580 and GOI-850 from a Foundation terminal in New Zealand.

Pardon my absence, but I&#39;d like Sigma-8 ready to move out when I get back.

After all these years of searching.
