[[include component:image-block name=monster8editub9-new.jpg|caption=SCP-682 shortly after escaping from containment, still recovering from acid immersion.]]

**Item #:** SCP-682 

**Object Class:** Keter 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-682 must be destroyed as soon as possible. At this time, no means available to SCP teams are capable of destroying SCP-682, only able to cause massive physical damage. SCP-682 should be contained within a 5 m x 5 m x 5 m chamber with 25 cm reinforced acid-resistant steel plate lining all inside surfaces. The containment chamber should be filled with hydrochloric acid until SCP-682 is submerged and incapacitated. Any attempts of SCP-682 to move, speak, or breach containment should be reacted to quickly and with full force as called for by the circumstances.

Personnel are forbidden to speak to SCP-682, for fear of provoking a rage-state. All unauthorized personnel attempting to communicate to SCP-682 will be restrained and removed by force.

Due to its frequent attempts at containment breach, difficulty of containment and incapacitation, and high threat of Foundation Exposure, SCP-682 is to be contained in site [REDACTED]. The Foundation will use the best of its resources to maintain all land within fifty (50) kilometers clear of human development.

**Description:** SCP-682 is a large, vaguely reptile-like creature of unknown origin. It appears to be extremely intelligent, and was observed to engage in complex communication with [[[SCP-079]]] during their limited time of exposure. SCP-682 appears to have a hatred of all life, which has been expressed in several interviews during containment. (See Addendum 682-B). 

SCP-682 has always been observed to have extremely high strength, speed, and reflexes, though exact levels vary with its form. SCP-682&#39;s physical body grows and changes very quickly, growing or decreasing in size as it consumes or sheds material.  SCP-682 gains energy from anything it ingests, organic or inorganic. Digestion seems to be aided by a set of filtering gills inside of SCP-682&#39;s nostrils, which are able to remove usable matter from any liquid solution, enabling it to constantly regenerate from the acid it is contained in. SCP-682&#39;s regenerative capabilities and resilience are staggering, and SCP-682 has been seen moving and speaking with its body 87% destroyed or rotted. 

In case of containment breach, SCP-682 is to be tracked and re-captured by all available Mobile Task Forces, and no teams with fewer than seven (7) members are cleared to engage it. To date (██-██-████), attempted breaches have numbered at seventeen (17), while successful breaches have numbered at six (6). (See Addendum 682-D).

**Addendum 682-B:** Portion of recorded transcript of [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-682/682.mp3 ██████].

&gt; **SCP-682:** (No verbal communication) 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr.** ██████: If you don&#39;t talk now, we will remove you from this attempt and place you back into-

&gt; 
&gt; **Dr.** ██████: (To Personnel D-085) That microphone has only so much gain, move it closer to it! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Personnel D-085:** His throat&#39;s messed up man, look at it! He ain&#39;t talking- (Gasps and screams) 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-682:** (Appearing to assault D-085&#39;s body) ...they were... disgusting... 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** (Retreats from the room) 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Addendum 682-E:** Termination Options: 

**Log of event 682-E18:** Dr. █████ attempts to use [[[SCP-409]]] on SCP-682. General ███, General ██████, and Dr. ██████████ observing. 

&gt; 0400: Exposure. SCP-682 began to tear at the point of contact, causing massive trauma to the area. SCP-682 requests several times to know what it has been exposed to. 
&gt; 
&gt; 0800: Crystallization begins, spreading much slower than normal. 
&gt; 
&gt; 1200: SCP-682 shows signs of extreme pain, and begins having seizures 
&gt; 
&gt; 1300: Crystallization stops at 62% conversion. Crystallized area explodes, causing massive physical trauma to SCP-682 
&gt; 
&gt; 1400: SCP-682 recovers from exposure, despite the loss of limbs and organs. SCP-682 begins regeneration, stating that it will attempt to kill and consume all staff involved in Event 682-E18. 

SCP-682 appears to now be immune to [[[SCP-409]]]. Use of other SCP items to terminate SCP-682 must now first be tested on samples of SCP-682 before full-scale testing. 

In accordance the Dr. ████████&#39;s recommendations (see Document 27b-6), Dr. ███████ and Dr. █████ have requested permission to attempt the termination of SCP-682 using [[[SCP-689]]]. The request is currently pending approval from the ████████. 

It has also been suggested by Dr. Gears to use [[[SCP-182]]] in an attempt to communicate with SCP-682. [[[SCP-182]]] has expressed reluctance, and refuses to enter the containment center of SCP-682, if at all possible.
