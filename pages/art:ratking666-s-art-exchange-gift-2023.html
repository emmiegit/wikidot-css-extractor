This page contains fanart of [[*user Karathh]]&#39;s [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6777 SCP-6777], illustrated by me. It also contains fanart of [[*user Karathh]]&#39;s and [[*user AnAnomalousWriter]]&#39;s [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7103 SCP-7103]. 

I would be remiss not to mention you check out Karathh&#39;s author page [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/karathh here], and if you enjoy my art, check out my other works on this wiki... whenever I finish update my author page. Because I&#39;m updating it to be more up-to-date with who I am as a person nowadays. Thanks!

&gt; Art Exchange has been a lot of fun. 2023 had me tasked to do an art exchange for -JP author [[*user Karathh]], who requested something involving [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6777 SCP-6777]. I was happy to oblige and wondered how it would turn out, since I don&#39;t often draw anime-stylized characters.

&gt; I ended up drawing this, which is a interpretation of the ending where Bakuu realizes her transmission has been cut off. I imagine that no matter what kind of god you are, if you&#39;re having a rough time, your panicked state will not look pretty at all. 

&gt; Originally, I wasn&#39;t going to draw this article in this context. It was mostly going to be just a normal drawing of Bakuu, but while I was working on it, I kind of got carried away and started playing around with the more unsettling side of the article, which I feel is a bit underrepresented in the art of it. 

&gt; I&#39;m happy with how it turned out. It was a lot of fun to work on. I did find myself wanting to do another article by Karathh because I&#39;ve really enjoyed their articles. This lead into...

&gt; A drawing of SCP-7103! Yes, I really love this one. When I had the idea to draw this, I looked through other interpretations of SCP-7103, and I found myself a bit wondering why some didn&#39;t go for a weirder look. Since this article is inspired by 173, which has a pretty strange appearance, I wanted to make Gyggel look a bit odd too.

&gt; I gave him weird eyebrows hung up by stone lines, a funny little scared expression, and a few sculpted hairs. I&#39;m really happy with how he turned out. 

&gt; I did want to draw other articles, like [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-2434-jp SCP-2434-JP], but I would probably have started overworking myself at that point. Maybe I&#39;ll draw it at some point, I really like it as well. The point is, Karathh is a really nice person and you should check out their work. Thanks for looking at my art!</textarea></pre>
