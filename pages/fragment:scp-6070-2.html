+++ Special Containment Procedures
[[span style=&#34;color: rgb(var(--basalt-sub-text-color));&#34;]]SCP-6070 is located in a modified containment chamber in Site-54. SCP-6070 is coupled with the site&#39;s fast-neutron nuclear fission reactor&#39;s secondary coolant loop.

If the temperature in SCP-6070&#39;s containment chamber drops below 20 Â°C, the site&#39;s reactor thermal output must be increased to compensate. The thermal output required to keep SCP-6070 stable is expected to rise indefinitely. Before the Site-54 reactor reaches its physical limits, a dedicated reactor must be constructed to supply SCP-6070 with enough heat to compensate for the energy loss.[[/span]]

The computer system connected to SCP-6070 must not be accessed, its sound output must be muted, and the status LED must be obscured. 

Personnel aware of SCP-6070 and its current state must not come into contact with Personnel bearing O4 and O5 credentials that are unaware of the infohazardous effects affecting SCP-6070. Instructions by such personnel are to be followed exactly without further inquiry or feedback to the best of staff&#39;s ability. To limit exposure of administrative personnel to infohazards, failing to do so must not be reported directly, but instead through RAISA staff.

----
+++ Description
SCP-6070 was an experimental anomalous rocket thruster designed for deep space missions. It was built by Foundation researchers in 1991 and tested for two years before arriving at the conclusion that it is incapable of performing its intended function.

In 2093, an unknown entity designated GOI-6070 will begin siphoning energy from the system through unknown means. The time loop within SCP-6070 leads to a thermal flow into the device in present day. This thermal flow is not subject to the laws of thermodynamics and will continue virtually indefinitely.

+++ Incident Report SCP-6070/2

**Date of incident:** 26.03.1993
**Item #:** SCP-6070
**Object Class:** Keter

**Preliminaries:**
[[span style=&#34;color: rgb(var(--basalt-sub-text-color));&#34;]]At the time of the incident, SCP-6070 was located at Site 54, awaiting transport to Preliminary Site 1950. SCP-6070 was still coupled to the site&#39;s nuclear reactor cooling system. Technical staff was preparing the device for transport.[[/span]] During the event, SCP-6070 was still actively participating in the transmission protocol used for communication with GOI-6070.

**Incident Report:**
When SCP-6070 was prepared for transport, the first arriving technician noticed an incoming transmission from GOI-6070. The transmission had begun several days prior and was automatically received and logged by the digital communications system. The technician notified research staff, but since the transmission was still in progress and likely to take many more hours, no researcher responded at that time.

After approximately five more hours, the system recognized the end of transmission by the code phrase &#39;END MSG&#39; and logged the received message. An audible sound was triggered to notify surrounding staff, and an LED began flashing. Since SCP-6070 was classified as Level 1 &#34;Unrestricted&#34;, the same technician working in the storage area was allowed to, and subsequently proceeded to, access the message.

Later analysis would reveal that the message contained a series of six cognitohazardous linguistic phrases. Each of the first five phrases was designed to target the recipient of the whole message and force them to send the entire message back by another 100 years. Those agents were targeted at specific recipients and were otherwise inert, having no further effect on remaining recipients, including the acting technician. The last phrase was a complex meme targeted specifically at staff from the present day Foundation and had an immediate and severe effect on the acting technician.

Since preparations for transport of SCP-6070 were virtually completed, the technician was the only remaining staff at SCP-6070. When the meme took effect, they were in the process of writing instructions to logistical staff for the upcoming transport. Once the technician read the message, they stopped their work and left SCP-6070 unattended for eight minutes. During this time, they were retrieving a permanent UV-resistant black marker from their office. Once they returned, they began painting several cognitohazardous and infohazardous symbols and phrases onto SCP-6070. After approximately one hour, they finished the last symbol. Following this, they logged into the logistical system of Site 54 and suspended the upcoming transport request. Only then did the effect of the memetic agent subside and the technician recognized what had happened. They immediately triggered a breach alarm and later surrendered themselves to arriving counter-memetic staff.

**Analysis of memetic agents inscribed on SCP-6070:**
The memetic agents have been analyzed and can be split into three different groups:
* Cognitohazardous agents hindering subjects from dismantling SCP-6070 or its functional parts
* Cognitohazardous agents hindering subjects from altering the memetic agents inscribed on SCP-6070
* Infohazardous agents that hinder people aware of the memetic agents from ordering (or somehow directly causing) decommissioning of SCP-6070 or alteration of the memetic agents.

All memes are crafted from linguistic and symbolic phrases that interlink in a complex pattern. This pattern is likely constructed in a way that forces subjects to perceive all memetic agents once a fraction of them has already taken effect. Research into this apparent meta-pattern is underway.

+ Records and Information Security Administration
+++ Notification about RAISA involvement

[[span style=&#34;color: rgb(var(--basalt-sub-text-color));&#34;]]Dear Dr. Gutenberg

I reach out to you to inform you that the Records and Information Security Administration will coopt itself into your SCP-6070 work group. Don&#39;t worry, you will remain in place as the head of research, this is not a disciplinary measure.[[/span]] I am sure you are aware of the cognitohazardous memes that emerged from Incident SCP-6070/2, and are beginning to realize how they affect you. However, the inability of your team to proceed with decommissioning SCP-6070 is unfortunately not the only adverse effect of the memetic agents. They further possess a contagious infohazardous property that makes it impossible for anyone aware of the memes to be involved in decommissioning SCP-6070.

Scenarios like this are unique in their ability to disrupt the typical Foundation modus operandi. Specifically, we cannot risk exposing our superiors to the infohazard, but likewise we cannot instruct anyone else to do our work, as this would involve us in dismantling SCP-6070.

There are no specific procedures in place for such an event -- they would be rendered useless by the memetic agent anyway -- but I do have a course of action in mind. 

[[span style=&#34;color: rgb(var(--basalt-sub-text-color));&#34;]]I have expunged all information regarding incident SCP-6070/2 from its file, and I will equally expunge all information about this memo within the SCP-6070 documentation.[[/span]] I have taken measures to convey the gravity of the situation to anyone reading the file without stating what the actual problem is. I will now ask Overwatch to deal with the anomaly without the infectious information and hope they will figure out how to follow up on your proposal without exposing themselves to the anomaly.

[[span style=&#34;color: rgb(var(--basalt-sub-text-color));&#34;]]In the meantime I have granted selected members of your team O4 access to a new draft iteration of the SCP-6070 file that remains affected by the memetic agents, so you and your team may proceed with documentation in the draft version.[[/span]]

Good luck.

With best regards,

All maintenance and testing must be carried out while time in SCP-1950 is reversed to prevent catastrophic expansion of SCP-1950 in case of wormhole failure. Should SCP-6070 be decommissioned, the wormhole must be deactivated while time in SCP-1950 is reversed.[[/span]]

[[div class=&#34;floatbox&#34;]]
They want to guard a damn infohazardous wormhole with just two D-Class? What is this?

Do not interfere. The only way to solve this, is to trust O5 to fix this their way. We are infected, we cannot talk to them
- Jones
[[/div]]
[[span style=&#34;color: rgb(var(--basalt-sub-text-color));&#34;]]While not being tested, two guards selected from trusted D-Class personnel are to be stationed outside of Preliminary Site 1950. The D-Class are to be administered Class H anterograde amnestics before their shift to prevent infohazardous infection from the memetic filters and to prevent veil breaches should a D-Class leave their post. No more personnel are to be stationed at SCP-6070.

Video surveillance of SCP-6070 must be impossible, and contact with stationed D-Class personnel should be avoided. SCP-6070 research personnel must not communicate with stationed D-Class.

[[span style=&#34;color: rgb(var(--basalt-sub-text-color));&#34;]]SCP-6070 is being tested by Foundation researchers as a potential infinite energy source to power future sites. The current prototype is located near the Site of SCP-1950 to prevent an expansion of SCP-1950&#39;s radius in case of catastrophic wormhole failure.

SCP-6070 is protected by a memetic filter that prevents conscious alteration and disassembly to protect the device against hostile intervention and decommissioning.[[/span]]

+++ Incident SCP-6070/3

**Date of incident:** 19.04.1993
**Item #:** SCP-6070
**Object Class:** Keter

**Preliminaries:**
[[span style=&#34;color: rgb(var(--basalt-sub-text-color));&#34;]]As instructed by Overwatch Command, SCP-6070 had been relocated to Preliminary Site 1950 and entirely new Special Containment Procedures were set in place.

Research personnel disconnected the monitor that allowed access to the messages received via SCP-6070 and left it at Site-54 to prevent exposure of D-Class personnel to new messages.[[/span]] The memes inscribed on SCP-6070 prevented researchers from disabling the computer system, so instead a network connection was created that allowed remote access to SCP-6070&#39;s computer system. [[span style=&#34;color: rgb(var(--basalt-sub-text-color));&#34;]]This technically allowed the research team to access messages received through SCP-6070 and was found to be a possible alteration even under influence of the memetic agents.[[/span]]

**Incident Report:**
[[span style=&#34;color: rgb(var(--basalt-sub-text-color));&#34;]]A few weeks before the incident, GOI-6070 began transmitting a message. This went unnoticed because messages were ignored to[[/span]] limit exposure to memes. Later analysis showed that the message exploited a buffer overflow vulnerability [[footnote]] A type of security flaw in software that can be exploited by unexpectedly long messages [[/footnote]] to gain memory access to the computer system attached to SCP-6070. The message then contained an encoded version of an [[[scp-2234|as yet unidentified anomalous computer virus]]] that was injected into main memory and subsequently executed. The computer virus accessed a connected network printer at Site-54 through the network connection that had been established beforehand.

On 21.04.1993, 01:58 CST, the virus printed an animated memetic agent over the network printer and infected research assistant H. Schneider who was using the printer at the time. The memetic agent was designed as a contagion targeting O4-personnel. At 02:03 CST senior researcher Dr. F. Hammer entered a laboratory currently occupied by the SCP-6070 research team. He encountered Ms. Schneider who uttered a contagious memetic phrase to him, which took effect immediately.

At 02:05 CST, Dr. Hammer called ETTRA dispatch and ordered the immediate deployment of four MTF units to Preliminary Site 1950. Dr. Hammer claimed to have reliable intelligence that a large, heavily armed deployment of Global Occult Coalition combatants was en route to SCP-6070. The MTF deployment was authorized using the O4 credentials granted to Dr. Hammer by RAISA shortly before.

[[span style=&#34;color: rgb(var(--basalt-sub-text-color));&#34;]]At 03:52 CST the request for four deployments was changed by ETTRA operatives to a rapid deployment request for MTF Nu-7 (&#34;Hammer Down&#34;) which was deemed an equivalent but easier to deploy force. 

Beginning from 07:13 CST, an MTF Nu-7 infantry platoon and an MTF Nu-7 light armored vehicle dispatchment arrived at Preliminary Site 1950 and began to secure the area.

At 12:00 CST four agents of the Global Occult Coalition approached the site from the south in a black Jeep. At the same time, two more suspicious vehicles approached from the north, which could not be identified immediately. Expecting heavy resistance, MTF Nu-7 opened fire on the Jeep and began approaching the two northern vehicles. The driver of the Jeep was hit by the first volley of gunfire and lost control over the vehicle, which started to skid. Nu-7 operatives continued firing, until it flipped over.[[/span]]

[[span style=&#34;color: rgb(var(--basalt-sub-text-color));&#34;]]Alerted by gunfire, one of the two northern vehicles stopped and turned around at 12:01 CST. It is assumed that the occupants were civilians. The other vehicle, a white van, sped up and approached Preliminary Site 1950. MTF Nu-7 opened fire on the Van with a BGM-71 TOW, killing its occupants instantly and setting the engine block on fire. At this point in time, it is unknown who ordered and authorized the use of explosive weapons.[[/span]] Connections to the cognitohazardous breach event in Site-54 are being investigated. [[span style=&#34;color: rgb(var(--basalt-sub-text-color));&#34;]]The first Jeep was continuously fired at. It is unknown when its occupants died, as reports by Nu-7 agents conflict each other about movement within the vehicle. At 12:03 CST, the encounter ended with a cease-fire command issued by the commanding Nu-7 agent, after a second BGM-71 missile hit the first vehicle.[[/span]]

**Aftermath:**
[[span style=&#34;color: rgb(var(--basalt-sub-text-color));&#34;]]Investigation of the disabled vehicles revealed eight dead GOC agents who had been approaching the site. The agents were dressed in civilian clothing without any body armor. All were equipped with a concealed handgun and a spare magazine. No other weaponry was found in the vehicles.[[/span]] The agents were carrying protective gear against visual and auditory cognitohazards, and had infiltration and surveillance equipment in the cars. [[span style=&#34;color: rgb(var(--basalt-sub-text-color));&#34;]]The cars were not armored and had no indication of preparation for a firefight.

At this point, Nu-7 operatives began to question the proportionality of their deployment, and sought confirmation about their mission directives with Command. In later interviews, multiple Nu-7 agents specifically denounced the operation and complained about having been lied to regarding the mission. When ETTRA called back at Site-54 for inquiry about the supposed heavily armed GOC deployment, researchers reacted with confusion.[[/span]] It was only at this time, that the cognitohazardous breach was discovered.
