    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>The sun was kind the day of Dr. LePlante’s field test. The heat of the summer had finally died, and the cool breeze of autumn had swept through the small town. He had uncovered the foundation during their attempted cover up of several disappearances- one of which was his brother. 
They were both prodigious electrical engineers with a focus on applied robotics, but of the two, Dr. LePlante, now searching for his brother was far more inventive. His brother, the one lost in the Ikea, Sebastian had acquired a level of technical skill that surpassed all others in his field.  Between the two, they had built a drone unlike any other before it. Only about twenty kilograms, it stood a meter and a half high, in the shape of an egg. 
The shining white plastic, and seamless integration of it’s pieces did indeed make it look like an egg as well The drone itself sat in a line up of nine identical units. Just a little ways behind them stood Dr. LePlante with his field computer, a wireless connection to the drones already linked. 
He turned and spoke to the foundation members who had come to see if his boasts about having superior technology was just scientific hubris, or if this random civilian indeed had surpassed the foundation’s own ability.
“Good day everyone, and thank you for this chance. I wont waste your time with bluster so allow me to get right to it.”
His voice was crisp and cool like a winter’s wind. But it did carry with it an air of eagerness, like a child showing off his favorite toys. His hand pass over top of the first drone and a soft white light illuminated, and faded in response to the tough. 
As the four propellers shifted and pulled away from the egg shape, the underbelly of the drone began to reveal itself as something quite different from standard drone technology. On a rotating underbelly, dozens of cameras and sensors began to whir to life, flickering and adjusting aperture lenses. The blades began to spin, and after a moment of a loud whir filling the air, the drone launched into the air and began hovering about fifteen meters into the air.

“I am sure you all have the rundown on the specs of these, but I will run through them quickly. Each drone is equipped with a Li-Dar, GPS, the ability to connect to wireless internet, and half a dozen or so lenses including thermal, infrared, ultra violet, night vision, and a specialty spectrometer that can identify the composition of most materials. That is of course, in addition to live video footage.

Max turned to the group, most of whom seemed thoroughly unimpressed so far. 
Fair enough. He thought as he typed in the initiation sequence into the field computer. Let’s show em the goods then.
Enter
His finger punched the key as if to make a point.

All the drones began their start up processes and in a moment or two, all nine of them were in the air. They floated around one another for just a moment, communicating the final instructions from the laptop.
Max could feel his heart thumping away in his ears, nervous that even this might not impress this shadow organization. 
The whirring picked up and after a moment, the drones flew off down the main road of the little town. 

“Dr. LePlante- this town has a population of five thousand, three hundred and eighty six. A nice medium sized town for you to demonstrate the abilities of your drones. How long do you think this will take?”

The man who spoke was an elderly fellow with a bushy gray beard and a balding head. He gave off an animus that Dr LePlante could feel at a distance. He was not sure why, but he could tell this man was not in favor of what was happening here. 

“Well sir…”

Max rotated his screen around to show the crowd, now trying to get closer to see the data in real time.

“The Li-Dar is already finished. Give them a few minutes to go down most of the streets, and I’d say we will have our map in about ten minutes.”

A few of the nameless faces raised their eyebrows and murmured to one another. One woman he noticed had taken an angle just over the head of one of her colleagues and was studying the screen carefully. 

“What is their range? You do not need to pilot them so I assume they have some sort of AI?”

Her voice was sharp and pierced the general murmur going on around the laptop.  Dr. LePlante stepped back and bowed slightly.

“Yes Ma’am, not very advanced, but with simple guidelines we are able to have them operate without user influence. As for the range…”

He pulled something from his pocket and held it out for her to examine. It was a single propeller with what looked like a small lighter sized piece of metal and plastic. Sticking out of the back of this thumb drive drone was a single antennae. 

“These are repeaters. Each drone carries nine. Each repeater extends the range by 3 kilometers. They act as breadcrumbs and redundant drives. They will broadcast the live signal back and store as much as much as one thousand hours of video footage, or about 100 hours of all its raw data.”

He tossed it in the air. Immediately the blades spun to life and lifted the thing into the altitude the larger drones had been at previously. 

“I call them the General Access Recon Modules. Garm for short. They have a healthy range of about 50 kilometers without the need for a repeater.”

The repeater hovered for a moment, a small red light flashed three times before it lowered itself slowly back to the ground, where Dr. LePlante picked it up and pocketed it. 

”If they are not needed, they will find a place to land and go into power saver mode. They only have a very simple camera, but they can also be recalled if the main drone is damaged. So we always collect our data.”

A few of the attending researchers visibly got excited at that. The concept of something so simple being such a success seemed somewhat odd to Dr. LePlante. Data recovery was one of the first concerns he had when designing the drone, and to see the Foundation thinking this was such a success was off putting.  A phrase drifted through the general white noise and it left him puzzled. 

“...anywhere near….fleshy….safety.”

He wanted to ask further questions about what he was hearing, but he knew better. This was his job application- if he started poking his nose into things, he had no doubt these people would vanish like a morning mist. The insignia on their jackets was burned into his mind- two concentric circles and three inward pointed arrows. 

A few minutes went by as the group seemed to grow even more animated. Dr. LePlante had told them it’d take about 10 minutes to map the entirety of the small town. That had been a lie. The drones were working in tandem and had massive range. The Li-Dar fly by had created a decent image of the town, but the drones were presently flying down the streets, passing just under the street lights. People would note the drones that day, but no one would ever understand what they were doing. 

The real life rendering of the entire town was completed in seven minutes and thirty four seconds.

The drones returned to a rather excited crowd. The only one frowning still was the balding man who had asked him  question before. His frown deepened as he looked at the screen a little closer.

“How in the world would you expect to download all that data in the field? That’s terabytes of information you are trying to process on a field computer.”

The excitement died down as the balding man stepped forward, claiming ownership of his accusatory question. 


”Well sir, the larger data packets are meant to be retrieved from the drone directly. Wireless data recovery is a safety feature, not the preferred method.” 

He knelt down and pulled out one of the repeaters from a drone that had landed and was slowing it’s propeller blades down.  The white plastic was heavier than it looked, even with the single propeller it had. Dr. LePlante handed over the repeater with no malice, but obvious caution for the man. 

“Everything you need to assess my drones is in there. Please let me know if it suffices.”

Dr. LePlante gave a courteous head bow and turned to the group of other researchers who were now beginning to ask their own questions. A large man with three large parallel scars on his face stepped forward with a hand shake.

“That was a hell of a show. I’m with MTF Zet-”

The female researcher from earlier cut off the mole rat with the same piercing voice that just cut through the chaos.

“How durable are they to external damages?”

Dr. LePlante considered for a moment, looking from the large brown haired, scarred man, to the woman who was nothing if not the embodiment of “Technical professionalism.” Her appearance seemed manicured down to the last detail- not a single hair out of place. Her large round glasses caught a glare of the light and hid her eyes from him. 

“Well…at present, no more so than a traditional drone. They’re still just plastic and light weight metals. But their ability for their data to be recovered more than makes up for-”

“So they’re cheap. Got it.”

She turned on her heel and moved back to the computer. In her hand she had one of the repeaters, but Dr. LePlant was not sure how or when she had taken it. 

”MTF Zeta-9 and I think your drones are damn impressive.”

Dr. LePlante looked up at the man, who despite his researcher’s badge, wore what he had come to know as a security guard’s uniform. Even had a gun on his hip. He locked eyes with the man, and with no sarcasm or ill will he spoke the same plain truth that had brought him this far.”

“If you help me get the chance to look for my brother, I will give the Foundation the schematics for these drones and all subsequent improvements.”

His eyes hardened into a metallic resolve. 

“Just help me find my brother.”

The man smiled at the determination of the applicant. They were not usually so determined to make it in, nor had any but the most desperate been willing to make such claims of giving away so much for so little. 
The O-5 council member who had infiltrated the meeting had hear all they needed to. The data would prove whether or not the doctor made it to the next step.

A few people broke away from the crowd, turning and making their way back to their unmarked vehicles. A single text message was sent out.

 //Drones are promising. If the map looks good, I say we start the on-boarding process.//


-----

Dr Maximilian LePlant sat on duty with the senior researcher of SCP 3008, Dr. Oxford. The gray bearded, balding man had come off as rather gruff in the first few interactions, but it had been several months since the start of the new project with the Infinite Ikea and the two had warmed up to one another. Thus far, the first few miles had been mapped and cataloged- slowly they were clearing away larger and larger swathes from the areas they could, creating large “roads” that led toward the only “exit” zone that seemed to be stable. 

Thus far, no one had found it. Or the supplies that had been dropped off and immediately shuffled off by the staff somewhere. 
So, the duty was often sitting long hours, a junior and senior researcher, simply making sure nothing happened. But after so many months of doing this, one’s mind wanders and people begin to talk. Dr. LePlante would never let it on directly, but he was full to bursting with questions about the Foundation and the things they were keeping secured away from the public. He had only been introduced to a handful of very specific SCP’s, and none of them had been his idea. 
The first SCP he was introduced to was actually the one he was becoming most enamored with- SCP 914. A couple of the senior staff had wanted to see what would happen if they ran his unique type of drone through the machine. The results of that were varied, but culminated in a now sapient owl cyborg that simply wanted to explore. 
The second test he had been made to perform was once again with his drones on SCP 038. This request was submitted and approved in the same day. Dr. LePlante didn’t recognize the symbol or signature of the one who put in for it, but the speed at which it was approved told him it was likely someone of importance.  The tree had cloned the drones but would not clone the repeaters within them. A separate experiment concluded the two simply needed to be individual instances, rather than done together as the repeater was successfully cloned. 
So now he and Dr. Oxford sat across from one another, each typing away intermittently on laptops. Before each of them was a word document with a very simple title SCP 682 Termination Ideas.
Dr. Oxford had been the one to rouse the question initially, but it was Dr. LePlante who decided to make it a document. Neither of them could have known that as soon as they had typed the numbers 682, one of the foundation web crawlers had attached itself through wireless connection and began to monitor the screens. 
Half a country away, a researcher on duty reclined in his chair, munching on a poptart when one of his screens flashes an alert and pulls up a window of the monitored screen. Smiling, the shaggy haired man sat up straight and brushed off the crumbs from his lap and pulled up an email. There was already a template loaded and required only a link to be filled in. 
A few clicks later, and the link to the encrypted crawler was sent off to a small group of researchers who took particular note of any and all notes regarding SCP’s like 682. There was a momentary pause as the emails went out and raised the alert for the sleeping and off duty members. Of the handful that got the link, only one other person opened it to watch the document. 
$50 says it’s going to involve using the sun. 
A small chat box opened within the email program, the only thing that served as an identifier was a nickname they had set as “DB Cooper.” 
I’ll take that. But if they say anything about nukes or something you owe me a steak dinner.
You’re on. 
The two bantered like high school kids taking a bet on a football game. Of course, this was no game to those who worked with 682. But to Dr. LePlante and Dr. Oxford, it was a thought experiment to pass the time. They were just unaware of the audience they now had. 
Damn. Dr. Oxford really has thought this trough. Dude is no fun though.
Hold on, I think they are actually building towards a similar point. 

Dr. LePlante looked up from his document and smiled. 
“Sir, you want to start or should I?”

”Go ahead, Max. Let’s hear it.”
“Well, to be frank, I think it is actually a pretty simple process…assuming some of the rumors I’ve heard floating around are true.”
Dr. Oxford cocked and eyebrow, curious, but expressing extreme doubt. By this time the cameras and microphones were activated for the two watching. The guard on duty grabbed the remains of his poptart and took a bite.
“This process presumes we have the capacity and ability to see, and access alternate dimensions. Ideally, we should be able to lock them off as well…”
The gray worm that passed for an eyebrow on Dr. Oxford’s face slowly returned to normal as the absurd suddenly became very real. 
SCP 3008…

“Assuming that, all we need to do is find a reality that has just had an XK event, or is about to. That’s step one. Step two is ensuring we have an ability to access this dimension and close it off if need be. Step three is to pacify 682, via unconsciousness or something that will take him time to heal from. Put it in a transport truck and send the truck through the portal. That’s step four. Last step is to close the portal behind it, and allow 682 to wake up thinking something went wrong during transport. He escapes into a dead, or dying world.”
That’s not a bad idea, actually.
I mean, we tried it. Thing came back from literal nothingness.
Yeah, but this isn’t nothing. This is just somewhere else.

Dr. LePlante rotated his screen revealing the steps as a simple bullet point document with a small paragraph below explaining the thought process. 
If 682 is truly indestructible, for whatever reason, be it magic, divine or malign intervention or maybe it simply is a force of nature, just like gravity. It cannot be destroyed. Therefor, we do not destroy it. We trap it somewhere it believes to be home. It wont look for a way back if it thought it never left, and it wont be seeking to kill US because it should ideally, think we are already dead or about to be. 

Dr Oxford folded down his laptop with a wry grin.
“Without going into the complexities, my point is that there is no killing 682, but you seem to have found a fun little work around.”
Dr. LePlante was a little taken aback. To him, it seemed fairly obvious that after so many attempts to destroy a thing, if it doesn’t stay dead, then the next best option is to get rid of it. 
But we can’t just unleash him on an unsuspecting universe. Just makes sense…
To him the idea was pretty standard. He wasn’t a very creative person, but the foundation was not always about creativity. Sometimes, it took fresh blood an ideas to help people get the mentality flowing again. 
I doubt it will work, but it could be fun. Should we look into the logistics?
Ha. I’m already filling out the paperwork. This guy has no idea what he’s getting himself into.
You sure we should be doing this? Seems a little mean spirited.
Oh don’t be a crybaby. He will be fine. Probably.
If you say so. But uh…neither of them talked about nukes or the sun. 
-DB Cooper has left the chat-
Dr. Oxford rubbed at his chin thoughtfully. 
“Not a bad idea, actually. But that’s assuming the Foundation has a lot more resources than we do for things like this. We can move mountains -sometimes literally if we need to, but they don’t like wasting money where they don’t gotta.”
Dr LePlante nodded, fully aware that the scope and absurdity of his plan was absolutely implausible.
“Of course Sir. But you did not give me a monetary cap for the question- you merely said, and I quote ‘How would you get rid of SCP 682?’”
“Fair point! Next time I’ll bring the financial records for the tests and we can set more strict parameters!”
While it was a joke, there was apart of the senior researcher that meant it. The duty days could be so dreadfully boring  would legitimately be more fun to work out imaginary financial records.
“Please don’t sir.” Dr. LePlante replied with a laugh as the two stood from the computers for a moment to stretch. 
“I’m gonna grab some coffee. You want somethin?” Dr. Oxford was already at the door before he stopped briefly to ask the question.
“If you could grab me a water, I’d be grateful!” With that, Dr. Oxford left and Maximilian LePlante turned back to the monitors of SCP 3008.
Elsewhere, man was grinning to himself as he filled out a stack of paperwork. Typically the dread of any foundation member, the request forms were sometimes a joy to fill out when there was a genuinely interesting idea to try. 682 was never going to die. Anyone who worked with the damn thing knew that by this point. But sometimes the only joy one got while working at the foundation was throwing absurd amounts of money and resources trying to destroy a really tough, dangerous thing.</textarea></pre>
