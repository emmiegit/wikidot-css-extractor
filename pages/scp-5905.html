SCP-5905 &#34;Gashadokuro&#34; written by: [[*user ManyMeats]]

Credit where credit is due to Shigeaki Yamauchi&#39;s &#34;World&#39;s Bizarre Thriller Complete Works 2: Monsters of the World&#34; (1972) which is where the yokai known as Gashadokuro first appeared. Being a ravenous fan of mythology, I was happy to have consumed this idea for nightmare fuel and regurgitated it into this, even if it&#39;s a &#34;modern creation&#34; versus other myth and legend.

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-5905 is contained in a sensitive materials vault at Site-17. The consumption of any type of food or water, including those required for medical or emergency purposes, is strictly prohibited within five meters of SCP-5905. The study of SCP-5905 is limited to secondary sources only.

All known instances of SCP-5905-1 have been destroyed. If additional instances of SCP-5905-1 should be encountered, all directives and priorities below Code Black are rescinded until the entity&#39;s destruction has been confirmed.

**Description:** SCP-5905 is a leather-bound grimoire recovered from the Huang Shui basin in Qinghai, China. This book details the treatment of prisoners, the preparation of objects of sacrifice, and a number of other ritualistic practices of an unclear cultural origin. Prolonged exposure to SCP-5905 causes hyperstimulation of the hypothalamus, resulting in accelerated metabolism and dramatically increased feelings of hunger and thirst. The book describes this effect as the &#34;Purity of Consumption&#34; and encourages exploration of these feelings by practitioners.

Within the pages of SCP-5905 is a ritual that is believed to be responsible for the creation of instances of SCP-5905-1. Due to ethical concerns, this cannot be verified.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Addendum.1: Incident Log&#34; hide=&#34;Log out and return to the main file&#34;]]
&gt; **[2015.02.28]**
&gt; //Foundation Site-36 received an urgent distress call from joint Chinese and GOC forces operating in the Qinghai province. Rapid response teams were dispatched while drone surveillance was deployed. GOC was notified of our intended assistance. The only intel provided was that they were engaged with a humanoid entity of unknown origin and intent.//
&gt; 
&gt; --**1301 hours:** MTF arrived at the last known location of GOC forces and followed a trail of destruction in order to locate SCP-5905-1 within the boundaries of a small fishing village. The total destruction of the GOC forces requesting backup is assumed. SCP-5905-1 was identified as a partially fleshed humanoid skeleton standing approximately 18 meters in height. The entity engaged MTF forces when they attempted to aid in the evacuation of local citizens.
&gt; 
&gt; --**1310 hours:** Deployed armaments are ineffective. MTF forces requested aerial strike and additional support. The rib cage of SCP-5905-1 expands and its thoracic cavity distends as a mass of tentacles explodes out from within. The appendages latch on to all available sources of organic matter including the GOC, MTF, and villagers, and adds them to its mass. SCP-5905-1 has increased in size by approximately 25%.
&gt; 
&gt; --**1328 hours:** Rockwell B-1 Lancer launched from Site-36 arrived at the conflict zone and fired precision-guided munitions at SCP-5905-1. Although the entity was impeded, it withstood the bombardment. Additional support requested.
&gt; 
&gt; --**1330 hours:** A Tomahawk Cruise Missile was fired from GOC Strategic Command Base #22 and MTF forces were advised to retreat to a minimum safe distance.
&gt; 
&gt; --**1335 hours:** Cruise missile arrived and detonated on target. MTF reports SCP-5905-1 was on fire but otherwise ambulatory and headed in the direction of another populated settlement. The Chinese government was notified and instructed to order an evacuation.
&gt; 
&gt; --**1358 hours:** Permission was given by the Chinese government to escalate the use of force. MTF was notified to vacate the area as a Boeing B-52 was deployed with a payload of 1 GBU-34/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB).
&gt; 
&gt; --**1420 hours:** SCP-5905-1 arrived at the farming village. The last recorded census puts the village at a population of 280; total casualties are unknown but assumed in totality. 
&gt; 
&gt; --**1501 hours:** Bomber signaled imminent arrival; Forces withdrew. SCP-5905-1 has finished feeding and is now 39 meters in height.
&gt; 
&gt; --**1508 hours:** MOAB detonates on target. SCP-5905-1 is destroyed as confirmed by MTF. Remaining biological fragments collected for incineration.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Addendum.2: Video Log&#34; hide=&#34;Log off and return to the main file&#34;]]
//After the events of Addendum.1, MTF operatives backtraced the path of destruction to a small farming community composed of 6 hovels and a central storehouse. The exterior door of the storehouse had been circumvented by percussive force, and several strips of flesh were found embedded in and around the door frame.//

//In the center of the storehouse was a ritual circle utilizing a number of thaumic sigils, pictographs, and cuneiform invocations centered around a beryllium bronze post one meter in height. Scattered among the debris were several implements of torture, three sets of manacles caked in an unidentified viscous compound, and various pieces of video recording equipment. These videos have been translated from a dialect of Hungarian known as Moldavian, transcribed, and attached to this file. Extraneous audio and video omitted.//

//Footage begins with the frame obscured by the upper body of the camera&#39;s operator as they adjust focus. The individual has been designated as POI-5905.//

&gt; **POI-5905:** Tuesday, day 1. The prisoner is a healthy local male, and is uninjured aside from bruises sustained in apprehension. Chinese national. Vitals are good. Liver function so-so. We begin tonight at sundown. I&#39;ve read the book a hundred times, I&#39;ve said the words two hundred times. We will cut until I find satisfaction and our ancestors become proud.

//POI-5905 backs away from the camera and looks into the lens, nods, and steps to the side. Shackled to a metal post with their hands above their head is an adult male. The subject&#39;s eyes are glazed over suggesting the use of a sedative or possibly the side-effects of a concussion.//

//Video is fast-forwarded several hours. As the surroundings darken, unidentified accomplices place and light candles at various locations throughout the room. As these individuals place candles they rhythmically chant an invocation. The audio and translation have been redacted due to a suspected cognitohazardous link to SCP-5905. When the candles are lit, the five hooded participants and the ritual leader, POI-5905, assemble around the target and continue chanting. POI-5905 retrieves an implement from off-screen and makes a series of small incisions on the torso of the subject in order to create cuneiform characters. The subject regains consciousness during this phase of the ritual and begins screaming. The first tape ends.//

//Additional videos were discovered but have been evaluated as repetitious. This ritual practice is repeated for an additional 8 days, making 9 days in total.//

//On the 10th day, the ritual subject is severely emaciated. Cheeks, eyes, ribs are all sunken and his abdomen is distended. Legs and arms are visibly atrophied at a rate substantially more aggressive than expected for ten days of confinement. The ritual continues to its next phase as POI-5905 retrieves a hexagonal piece of metal that is then placed around the base of the subject&#39;s index finger. When this metal band is twisted and pulled, blades strip the subject&#39;s flesh from their finger and leave behind only bone and sinew. While continuing to chant over the subject&#39;s screaming, POI-5905 then feeds the flesh to the ritual subject, placing it in their mouth and forcing them to swallow. This videotape ends after all of the subject&#39;s fingers have been stripped..//

//Footage resumes on day 11 and the ritual repeats except with the toes. The ritual repeats again each day with a new part of the body through day 20. It is noted that after day 12, the subject no longer resists ingestion.//

&gt; **Note:** Despite exposed wounds, severe malnourishment, and suspected dehydration, the ritual subject appears both alert and responsive throughout.

//On day 21, POI-5905 unshackles the ritual subject and recites a final invocation. Ritual subject begins to claw at their own skin with the exposed bones of their fingers, tearing strips and chunks from other wound sites as they engage in auto-cannibalism.//

//Shortly before what is assumed to be sunrise, the ritual subject&#39;s breathing becomes ragged and inconsistent and they fall limp. Pronounced cracking and snapping sounds can be heard over the continuous chanting of participants as the ritual subject begins to grow in size, their skeletal structures bulging and bursting between what little tissue remains. Ritual subject&#39;s limbs elongate as it pulls itself up, finishing its conversion to SCP-5905-1.//

//Ritual participants break from their chanting and try to flee, however, SCP-5905-1&#39;s stomach bulges and swells before purple and black pseudopods erupt out, ensnaring the closest ritualist. SCP-5905-1 then inserts the ritualist&#39;s head into its jaw and bites down resulting in the ritualist&#39;s death. Snapping and cracking is heard as pseudopods insert the corpse into SCP-5905-1&#39;s thoracic cavity. SCP-5905-1 then exits off-camera in pursuit of additional ritualists. The footage ends.//

**Addendum.5905.3:**
Within the pages of SCP-5905 was a hand-written insert. It is believed to have been written by the ritual leader and has been transcribed and attached to the record.

&gt; My first meal tasted of copper and desperation but I have come to savor the sweetness.
&gt; Babushka worried I do not eat well, but //I am// eating.
&gt; Every year my stomach grows smaller and I grow weaker but I can teach the others before my time [has ended].
&gt; Each new meal drowns them just a bit deeper. None of us need it but now we all want it.
&gt; Hunger gnaws at that place inside of me, craving purpose, fulfillment, excitement, and I fear I have found it.
&gt; If this goes well, I hope they will invite me to their feast.
&gt; I deserve a seat at the table.
