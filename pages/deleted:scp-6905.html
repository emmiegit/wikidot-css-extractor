**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6905 is to be kept in a containment chamber, 100m across, in both directions, and 200m tall. The roof of the chamber is to be made of completely transparent glass. On either side of SCP-6905’s containment chamber, there is to be two metal doors, with no gaps. The ground of SCP-6905’s containment chamber is to be fully covered in a thick layer of dirt. A D-Class is to provide 1l of water to SCP-6905 everyday day.

**Description:** SCP-6905 is a birch tree, approximately 150m tall. SCP-6905 has branches, that appear across all angles of it. There are no leaves or roots attached to SCP-6905, although it is still perfectly healthy. 

On the end of every one of SCP-6905’s branch is a small ornament, with a silver string wrapped around it. The ornament[[footnote]] SCP-6905-1 [[/footnote]] physically appears to be a human skull. Every instance of SCP-6905-1 will appear on branches whenever they grow, even with no physical way of this being possible.

When cutting into SCP-6905, the cut bark will regrow at astonishing rates, in the form of a ‘bubble’[[footnote]] SCP-6905-2 [[/footnote]]. SCP-6905-2 instances contain a thick mixture[[footnote]] SCP-6905-3 [[/footnote]] of regular tree sap, seeds of SCP-6905, human blood and live bugs. 

Instances of SCP-6905-2 are clearly defined as domes of bark, around a cut area of the tree. If these instances are cut completely through, SCP-6905 will die, and the seeds within it will scatter, and implant themselves into land. This leads to the seeds growing into instances of SCP-6905, over anywhere between 4 months to 8 years. An average instance of SCP-6905 contains around 8,000 seeds. Fortunately, only about 100 of these will fully mature into instances of SCP-6905.

While the SCP-6905 instances are not fully grown, they possess no anomalous qualities and can be cut with no anomalous effects.

SCP-6905-4 refers to a thin, orange gas, which will often come put of SCP-6905-2 if it is cut. SCP-6905-4 is a tactile cognitohazard. When SCP-6905-4 makes contact with human tissue, the tissue will get an increasingly painful itch, while peeling back into itself. The skin of the affected will become similar in texture to that of SCP-6905’s bark, losing all pigmentation. Their blood will turn into an instance of SCP-6905-3. They will [DATA EXPUNGED]. The affected will by this point be classified as an instance of SCP-6905.

**Addendum:** 
&gt; **EXPERIMENT #:** 6905-032
&gt; **DATE OF OCCURRENCE:** 2020/3/16
&gt; **EXPERIMENT REASON:** What would happen if we attempted to cut down, and therefore possibly neutralise, SCP-6905?
&gt; 
&gt; **[12:07]** //D-████ walks into SCP-6905’s containment chamber. D-████ is visibly and audibly experiencing discomfort. D-████ is holding a large knife.//
&gt; **D-████:** Fucking shit. They- this is fucking- 
&gt; //D-████ approaches SCP-6905.//
&gt; 
&gt; **[12:08]** //D-████ cuts into the bark of SCP-6905. SCP-6905-3 starts to pour out of the cut.//
&gt; **D-████:** What in the fuckin- 
&gt; //SCP-6905-2 begins to form, notably shaping around D-████ arm, which is still close to SCP-6905-2//
&gt; **D-████:** [DATA EXPUNGED]
&gt; 
&gt; **[12:09]** //D-████ attempts to take his arm out of SCP-6905-2, which he succeeds in, by cutting SCP-6905-2 from the inside. SCP-6905-4 ‘bleeds out’ of the cut.//
&gt; **[DATA LOST]**
