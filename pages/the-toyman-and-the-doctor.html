&gt; **THE TOYMAN AND THE DOCTOR**
&gt; //(A Little Bit Of Fiction By You Know Who)//
&gt; 
&gt; “I’m just… bored.”
&gt; 
&gt; Doctor Wondertainment was not a real doctor.
&gt; 
&gt; “Kids don’t care about my toys any more. It’s all virtual, these days. Who cares about having a real friend any more? Jessie! Cancel the next line of Misters! They never sold anyway.”
&gt; 
&gt; Four hundred metres down, twelve half-developed embryonic monstrosities were euthanized.
&gt; 
&gt; “Sitting inside all day, sharing cat pictures on the internet, looking up who knows what through who knows where. They won’t pay attention to the real world.”
&gt; 
&gt; Jessie walked through the door, coffee in one hand and PDA in the other.
&gt; 
&gt; “Sir, that’s not quite –“
&gt; 
&gt; “YOU PUT THAT FUCKING THING DOWN.”
&gt; 
&gt; The Toyman leapt to his feet, tore the PDA from her hands, and threw it out the window.
&gt; 
&gt; “Sir, that was –“
&gt; 
&gt; The Toyman pulled the burning hot coffee from her grip and threw it in her eyes.
&gt; 
&gt; “AHHHHHHHH –“
&gt; 
&gt; The Toyman threw Jessie out the window.
&gt; 
&gt; “Jessie, you stupid, stupid girl.”
&gt; 
&gt; The Doctor pressed a button under his desk.
&gt; 
&gt; Jessie walked through the door, coffee in one hand.
&gt; 
&gt; “Sir, that’s not quite right. Market studies are showing that… hang on, I think I left something in –“
&gt; 
&gt; “No, no, no…”
&gt; 
&gt; The Doctor pressed a button under his desk.
&gt; 
&gt; Jessie walked through the door, coffee in one hand.
&gt; 
&gt; “Sir, I completely agree.”
&gt; 
&gt; “I know, Jessie, I know. But how do we convince them to pay attention to the real world? These kids are spending every day indoors, their eyes are going to turn square from staring at all their video games and movies and cartoons and comic books and video games and comic books. How do we get this fresh generation out of the house?”
&gt; 
&gt; Jessie moved over to The Doctor, crossing her legs as she sat on his desk.
&gt; 
&gt; “Simple, sir. We destroy their houses. We tear the rooves from above their heads. We kill their parents and make them orphans. We force them into the streets, where they will finally be able to be play with your toys and be happy. And if they don’t want to be happy, we kill them.”
&gt; 
&gt; The Toyman grinned from ear to ear.
&gt; 
&gt; “You’re fucking brilliant, Jessie. But how do we…“
&gt; 
&gt; The Doctor pressed a button under his desk.
&gt; 
&gt; Jessie walked through the door, coffee in one hand.
&gt; 
&gt; “Sir, I completely agree.”
&gt; 
&gt; “I know, Jessie, I know. We need to make the outside more fresh and exciting, don’t we?
&gt; 
&gt; --------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; It is unknown whether Doctor Wondertainment is an individual --or an organization--.
&gt; 
&gt; --------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; “JESSIE! DON’T COME IN!”
&gt; 
&gt; “…sir?”
&gt; 
&gt; “When was the last time I had my pills?”
&gt; 
&gt; “I’m not sure, sir. You’ve killed me too often.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Get them for me. Please.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Sir, I’m not sure that-“
&gt; 
&gt; “I SAID GET ME MY FUCKING PILLS, BITCH!”
&gt; 
&gt; “Yes sir. Yes sir.”
&gt; 
&gt; Jessie walked through the door, coffee in one hand and “Doctor Wondertainment®’s Stop The Voices Pills!” in the other. She had tears streaming down her face. Bruises covered her arms and legs. Blood poured from the open head wound, and the gashes in her torso from the broken glass. The Doctor tore the coffee from her hands and The Toyman threw it in Jessie’s eyes and the coffee mixed with her tears.
&gt; 
&gt; “More coffee. More coffee.”
&gt; 
&gt; Jessie left the room and returned with more coffee. She placed The Doctor’s pillbox on his desk. The pillbox smiled at The Doctor and squeaked in violet whispers:
&gt; 
&gt; “Complementary! Please Take One!”
&gt; 
&gt; The Toyman screamed.
&gt; 
&gt; “YOU MISSPELT COMPLIMENTARY.”
&gt; 
&gt; Doctor Wondertainment downed his pills with Jessie’s tears.
&gt; 
&gt; The Toyman went back to sleep.
&gt; 
&gt; The Doctor died a little inside.

**Front:**

&gt; Dear Doctor Wondertainment.
&gt; My name is Ruiz.
&gt; I do not know my last name.
&gt; Mister Redd will not let me remember.
&gt; I have a brother. His name is Pico.
&gt; I am worried about Pico.
&gt; I am worried about myself.
&gt; Mister Redd took our parents away.
&gt; He says he is our family now.
&gt; I pretend to not understand.
&gt; I pretend that I am stupid but I am not.
&gt; I know our parents will not come back.
&gt; He tries to make us drink things that make us strange.
&gt; I throw it up and try to make Pico throw it up but he does not.
&gt; Sometimes Mister Redd cuts us and collects the blood.
&gt; I do not know what he does with the blood.
&gt; Sometimes Mister Redd calls you God.
&gt; Every night I pray to you that Mister Redd will be recalled.
&gt; I do not think that you can hear prayers.
