**Item #:** SCP-4370

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Threat Level:** ##yellow|●## Yellow

**Special Containment Procedures:** All roads and pathways leading to SCP-4370 have been redirected to the entrance to Bitterroot National Forest. Barbed metal fencing has been constructed in a rectangular formation around SCP-4370 to ensure interaction is not possible. Area-92 has been constructed within an opposing hill to oversee SCP-4370. Interaction of any kind with SCP-4370 is to be first approved by Senior Researcher ███████. As of Exploration 4370-1, permission to enter SCP-4370-1 is to be strictly reserved for the following task forces.

* Provisional Task Force Epsilon-72, &#34;Treasure State&#34;
* Mobile Task Force Lambda-5, &#34;White Rabbits&#34;

**Description:** SCP-4370 is a decommissioned playground slide located in Bitterroot National Forest, Ravalli County, Montana. SCP-4370 possesses a height of approximately 3.04 meters and a length of 9.14 meters.

SCP-4370 is entirely unpainted, with rust present on the majority of its surface. The words &#34;fun slide&#34; have been written in lowercase English on the surface of SCP-4370 with what has been identified as black permanent marker.[[footnote]]Said permanent marker was recovered 0.6 meters from SCP-4370. Marker was identified as belonging to the ██████ brand.[[/footnote]]

Following one (1) minute of exposure to SCP-4370, adolescent or adult individuals will experience a lingering feeling akin to being watched by an imperceptible entity. Following two (2) minutes of exposure, individuals will experience multiple voices, commonly within the age range of 10-65 years old, originating from unknown sources. The intensity and tone of these voices will progressively increase in hostility until the individual reaches ten (10) minutes of exposure, where they will experience pain similar to being physically assaulted by multiple person(s).[[footnote]]Kicking, hitting, slapping, punching, and biting have all been reported.[[/footnote]] This effect will continue until the individual has died via either blunt force trauma and/or blood loss. It is important to note that no sapient life aside from the subject is present during any level of exposure.

If an individual decides to slide down SCP-4370, SCP-4370 will function as a non-anomalous playground slide until the individual reaches ground level, where they will enter SCP-4370-1 if the sliding process has not been interrupted by an outside force. Interruption of the sliding process may prevent SCP-4370&#39;s anomalous effects from manifesting.

SCP-4370-1 appears to be a carbon copy of the U.S. state of Montana in the year 2019, with the primary exception being that any and all matter within SCP-4370-1 fails to reflect any colored light on the visible spectrum, along with the fact that all sapient life has gone extinct. Vegetation exists and functions normally within SCP-4370-1, though no sign of sapient life has been observed as of exploration 4370-1. It is important to note that any matter outside of the state of Montana does not exist within SCP-4370-1, and is instead replaced entirely by empty, dark space.

 //**Note:** Exploration of SCP-4370-1 has been forbidden to the majority of Foundation personnel as of Incident 4370-1, colloquially referred to as the disappearance of D-43980. Permission to enter SCP-4370-1 is to be strictly reserved for Provisional Task Force Epsilon-72.//

&gt; **Exploration Abstract:** Understand the nature and general appearance of SCP-4370-1.
&gt; 
&gt; **Duration:** 3 hours and 41 minutes
&gt; 
&gt; **Assigned Personnel:** D-43980, a former college dropout arrested for vandalism before being taken into Foundation custody.
&gt; 
&gt; **Additional Information:** The following is a transcript of a communication between Senior Researcher █████ and D-43980 regarding D-43980&#39;s exploration of SCP-4370-1.

&gt; **[BEGIN LOG, 11:43 AM EST]**
&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; 
&gt; **D-43980:** Gah, what the fuck! Why&#39;s everything grey?!
&gt; 
&gt; **Senior Researcher █████:** D-43980, please continue exploring SCP-4370-1. What do you see?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-43980:** Well, uh, I see trees and plants, but everything&#39;s... grey. The sky&#39;s also black.
&gt; 
&gt; **Senior Researcher █████:** Can you elaborate?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-43980:** Everything&#39;s grey, how can I elaborate more than that? I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re even sending me here for.
&gt; 
&gt; **Senior Researcher █████:** You are here to research the nature and details of SCP-4370-1.  Please continue the exploration.
&gt; 
&gt; //Approximately 35 minutes into exploration, D-43980 reestablishes communication with Senior Researcher █████.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-43980:** Uh, doc? I think this world&#39;s... broken. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Senior Researcher █████:** What do you mean?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-43980:** I got to the border of the state, I think, and, uh, there&#39;s nothing beyond it. It&#39;s just empty space.
&gt; 
&gt; **Senior Researcher █████:** Did you see anything while traveling?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-43980:** Yeah, I saw a couple buildings. No people, though.
&gt; 
&gt; **Senior Researcher █████:** Could you attempt an exploration of one of these buildings?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-43980:** Sure, why not? I mean, it&#39;s not like anything&#39;s here with me. What&#39;s the nearest city?
&gt; 
&gt; **Senior Researcher █████:** Belgrade should be north of you.
&gt; 
&gt; //D-43980 makes their way towards SCP-4370-1&#39;s iteration of Belgrade, Montana. 82 minutes into the exploration, D-43980 reestablishes communication with Senior Researcher █████.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-43980:** Okay, I&#39;m here. I&#39;m gonna go for...
&gt; 
&gt; //D-43980 pauses.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-43980:** ...The office building.
&gt; 
&gt; //D-43980 makes their way into the building.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-43980:** Uh, doc? Someone- some//thing//&#39;s staring at me from the distance.
&gt; 
&gt; **Senior Researcher █████:** Can you identify any distinct facial features?
&gt; 
&gt; //D-43980 pauses.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-43980:** N-No, I don&#39;t know who it is. I don&#39;t know //what// it is. It doesn&#39;t have a face. I&#39;m... I&#39;m going to leave.
&gt; 
&gt; //D-43980 makes their way out of the building, and towards the entry point of SCP-4370-1. Approximately 77 minutes later, D-43980 reestablishes communication with Senior Researcher █████.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-43980:** What the hell?
&gt; 
&gt; **Senior Researcher █████:** Are you able to exit SCP-4370-1?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-43980:** No, the slide&#39;s gone. I&#39;m really scared. I don&#39;t want to die.
&gt; 
&gt; **Senior Researcher █████:** Are you still within proximity of the entity you previously mentioned?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-43980:** Y-Yeah, It&#39;s getting closer. I&#39;m scared. It&#39;s making this weird static noise, and-
&gt; 
&gt; //Communication is cut off via an unknown external force.//
