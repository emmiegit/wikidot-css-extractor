**Special Containment Procedures:** The Rhodes Plaza Mall has been bought and repurposed into Site-86. A pair of guards are stationed at each entrance. No food is to be brought inside SCP-5847.

**Description:** SCP-5847 is the food court of the Rhodes Plaza Mall in Newcastle, Australia. It has two main anomalous effects. 

The first is that whenever a subject consumes food inside SCP-5847, it will morph into SCP-5847-1, a courtroom. SCP-5847-1 is fully populated by SCP-5847-2, which are sapient, animate foods resembling their non-anomalous counterparts in appearance but with the ability to anomalously perceive, vocalize, and locomote[[footnote]] Research into how SCP-5847-2 are able to do so is ongoing.[[/footnote]]. It has been hypothesized from recordings that all SCP-5847-2 instances inside SCP-5847-1 are food the subject has eaten throughout their life.

Once inside SCP-5847-1, the subject is transformed into a near facsimile of their previous appearance, but composed of what appears to be a thick cake icing. They must then defend the fact they eat food to a large piece of sugar candy. The only two rulings observed, have been that the subject is not guilty and free to go wherein SCP-5847-1 morphs back into SCP-5847, or that the subject is guilty of &#34;crimes against Humunchkind&#34; and is sentenced to death wherein an Execucumber will consume the subject whole.

The secondary effect of SCP-5847 is a memetic effect affecting anyone inside the courtroom that causes them to unintentionally replace words they say with the names of foods. 



**Addendum 5847-1 Transcription of security camera footage from a trial held inside SCP-5847-1:**
The following was recovered from a security camera set up in SCP-5847. For readability, the instances colloquial names have been used in place of SCP-5847-2[[footnote]] -A is referred to as Fudge, -B is referred to as Bailoaff, -C is referred to as Tomattorney, -D is referred to as Procharcuterie, and -E is referred to as Excecucumber.
