**Item #:** SCP-6538

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** 
SCP-6538 colonies are to be housed in a medium-sized habitat no less than 30 x 30 meters with the foliage made to replicate a common American northeastern hardwood forest. The chamber is to be filled with approximately 15 meters of dirt to allow the colony to establish underground nests. 

An advanced thermal scanner is to be installed inside the chamber to allow a rough estimate of how many instances are within the hive. A scan is to be done twice per week or each time that the dispensers are activated to ensure no SCP-6538 instance has escaped captivity. Maintenance on the scanner is to be done remotely with a drone.

Miniscule cameras are to be placed within the colony’s reach, in order for SCP-6538 to bring them into the nest for surveillance. Remote-controlled drones are to be sent periodically within the nest to observe the integrity of the colony and adjust the cameras. The drones are to be sprayed with specially-designed pheromones made to mimic the scent of an SCP-6538 instance beforehand.

Refuse and various discardable objects are to be introduced on the outside of the hive once every two weeks to satisfy the needs of the instances. No object capable of generating light or heat is to be placed inside the dispensers, as to avoid faulty readings with the scanner. Due to their herbivorous nature, the flora within the chamber is to be monitored and replaced to ensure that the colony has a sufficient food source. 

**Description:**
SCP-6538 are a species of social burrowing insects similar in appearance to members of the order Lepidoptera, specifically bearing physical attributes from moths. SCP-6538 instances measure an average of 70cm in height when standing upright, although some individuals have been recorded reaching almost a meter. 

The body of SCP-6538 is bulbous and composed of 6 legs with the head, thorax and abdomen all fused. The head area is composed of two large red eyes proportional to the body; two antennas adorning the top of the head along with a small mouth hidden behind the fluff of the body located below the eyes. SCP-6538 specimens are primarily herbivorous animals, feeding on flowers to extract sugar from their nectar. Because of this, SCP-6538 instances need to eat a large amount of flowers to obtain sufficient sugar proportionally to their size.

Compared to its relatives, SCP-6538 walk on the four hind legs with the frontal pair connected at the base of the head being used by the instances as a sort of makeshift grasping appendage. SCP-6538 instances are incapable of flight despite possessing wings;it is theorised that SCP-6538 instances evolved naturally to discard flight to pursue burrowing abilities, growing to sizes that prevented their wings from lifting them up.

SCP-6538 do not possess a larval caterpillar stage. Female instances will lay eggs at the end of winter and await a male to fertilize it. Once it is done, the eggs have a gestation time of ten to twelve days at the end of which emerges a fully formed individual, albeit smaller in size. Hatchlings take a few hours to become fully capable of movement.

Once a colony of SCP-6538 has been established by a few individuals, the instances will begin to seek out objects to adorn the nest. SCP-6538 instances appear to be able to &#34;sense&#34; objects through unknown means; instances have been seen to venture out great distances from the nest to obtain objects. Upon locating an object of interest, the instance will use their front appendages to grip onto and lift the object, after which they will bring it back to the nest. SCP-6538 instances have been observed to be particularly attracted to objects with reflective surfaces and a “shine”, akin to modern-day animals. However, the usage they get from such objects, if any, is yet to be determined. **[See Initial Discovery Log.]**

SCP-6538 are generally docile but are known to make threatening postures by lifting their arms and emanating high-pitched sounds once something they deem dangerous approaches them. If the subject continues to impede the instances or try to steal what they are carrying, they will drop whatever was being carried and begin attacking the subject with their arms as a group. These attacks are rarely fatal but can be should the subject remain near the aggravated instances. Once the threat has been dealt with, the instances resume any activity prior to provocation.

[[tab Initial Discovery Log]]
In 1966, Foundation personnel from Site-248 received information about various sightings of “Mothmen” in the vicinity of Lincoln, New Hampshire.

An elderly woman who submitted the most claims was interviewed by Site-248 agents while posing as officers. The woman stated that several instances would swarm her house at night, intending to harass her. She claimed that the creatures stole several of her belongings and, at one point, her dog. 

[[include component:image-block name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Wales%2C_United_Kingdom_%28Unsplash_5aTRlZYVCMI%29.jpg|caption=Entrance to the SCP-6538 colony.|width=350px]]

Three agents led by Agent Vickers were placed on the outskirts of the forest to survey the woman’s house, hoping to record the creatures in person. Once night fell, five instances appeared outside but did not enter the house. After a few minutes, the instances were observed stealing various objects from the garden. Two instances were recorded working together to lift a dog house and leave. All five instances were following each other heading in the same direction. After tracking them 10 kilometers away from the woman&#39;s house, the instances entered a cave system the entrance of which was overtaken by various debris and refuse.

Once they entered, Agent Vickers noted the presence of at least twenty instances transporting objects around the cavern. Some were noted to be digging away at the walls to enlarge it. After almost catching the attention of the instances, Agent Vickers and his men retreated and informed Site-248 of their discovery. 

MTF Echo-5 (&#34;Sting Operation&#34;) operatives led by Cptn. Tigris neutralized the colony through the usage of canisters filled with sedative gas. Several canisters were placed near the nest and rigged to open within an hour. Upon noticing them, the SCP-6538 instances brought the canisters within the cave, which released their contents within the hour. Echo-5 operatives entered the colony to neutralize any stragglers that escaped the sedative gas. Fifty-four instances were captured as a result of the operation and were subsequently brought to Site-248.

The following is a list of notable objects discovered further inside the colony.
&gt; - Several pieces of hiking equipment.
&gt; - Parts of various cars, trucks and bikes.
&gt; - Animal remains.
&gt; - Three human remains, later discovered to be the bodies of hikers that went missing in 1954.
&gt; - One bike.
&gt; - Various items of clothing and common household items such as forks.
&gt; - Several artillery shells in various states of completion, believed to have been taken from a factory near the area during the 1940s.
&gt; - An incomplete M4A1 Sherman medium tank hull. Inspection of the serial number on the parts revealed them to be coming from a factory ██km from the colony.

[[tab Testing Logs]]
A series of tests were conducted with the supervision of Head Researcher Turán on the colony contained at Site-248 to learn more about the social aspect of SCP-6538 along with their physical abilities.

**Experiment Log 6538 - 1**
&gt; __Date:__ //03/10/1967//
&gt; 
&gt; __Test Subject:__ SCP-6538-18
&gt; 
&gt; __Purpose of the test:__ Observe if SCP-6538 instances are capable of sensing an object from a distance without seeing it.
&gt; 
&gt; __Test Result:__ One SCP-6538 instance was selected and placed within a make-shift maze on one end. At the opposite end of the maze were placed some wooden planks. 
&gt; Once it had woken up from the sedation, the instance initially observed its surrounding area, which then was followed by it attempting to call for another instance. Hearing no return, the instance attempted to burrow through the wall in the direction of the colony which was unsuccessful, causing the instance to slightly get agitated. After 10 minutes since the start of the test, the instance finally began to enter the maze with it often bumping into dead-ends. During the first few times it encountered a dead-end, the instance seemed to be confused and touched the surface before retracing its steps. 
&gt; 
&gt; After 48 minutes, the instance was halfway through the Maze, where it then became noticeably more confused, as within the middle were ten possible paths to be taken, yet only two would&#39;ve led towards the end goal. The instance went near each path before taking a couple of steps back, this behavior was repeated for several minutes until it chose one path. When the instance met a dead-end, it seemingly got impatient as it raised its hands in the air and emitting high-pitched sounds. After retracing its steps, the instance quickly took the correct path towards the objects. After another six minutes the instance reached the opposite end and proceeded to interact with the objects as expected. 
&gt; 
//__Note:__ I came to this conclusion after ending the test. It doesn&#39;t matter what obstacle is in their way, if it&#39;s anywhere near it, SCP-6538 instances somehow know where to go and the quickest path to it. Notice how after a certain point it, for a lack of a better word, went “Auto-Pilot mode” and beelined to the planks? I think it can somehow sense suitable objects when close enough. - Head Researcher Turán//
------
**Experiment Log 6538 - 2**
&gt; __Date:__ //03/17/1967//
&gt; 
&gt; __Test Subject:__ Head Researcher Turán
&gt; 
&gt; __Purpose of the test:__ Accidental in nature, an escaped instance was discovered within the east-wing breakroom of Site-248.
&gt; 
&gt; __Test Result:__ Head Researcher Turán claims to have encountered an escaped SCP-6538 instance within a cabinet. The instance was in the middle of stealing a bag of coffee until it realized it was being watched, after which it remained motionless and stared at Head Researcher Turán before becoming aggressive. The instance was restrained and sedated by guards that were within the breakroom after a few minutes. It is unknown how the instance managed to both escape its containment room and enter the, at the time, very busy breakroom without being noticed until it was caught off-guard.
&gt; 
//__Note:__ Although shaken a little, Head Researcher Turán only received some bruises. You should have seen his face after we managed to remove the bugger from him. - Assistant Researcher Hoffman//
------
**Experiment Log 6538 - 3**
&gt; __Date:__ //03/21/1967//
&gt; 
&gt; __Test Subject:__ D-1128
&gt; 
&gt; __Purpose of the Test:__ Confirm the ability of SCP-6538 to remain unnoticed while in the presence of a human being, experiment initiated following **Experiment Log 6538 - 2**.
&gt; 
&gt; __Test Result:__ A test chamber was modified to resemble the interior of a typical American suburban home. D-1128, who volunteered for what they believed was an experiment on how living conditions affect a human being, entered the chamber. D-1128 settled in the home for a few hours before deciding to take a nap after three hours, one instance of SCP-6538 was introduced to the chamber at this point. 
&gt; 
&gt; While initially surveilling its surroundings, the instance began to wander around and pick up various objects that were in the vicinity, bringing them all in a secluded area of the house behind the water heater. SCP-6538 continued this behavior until it was disturbed by D-1128 snoring, SCP-6538 initially displayed a threat posture by lifting its arms before carefully approaching D-1128. After watching him for a few minutes, SCP-6538 began to probe D-1128 for items to steal. Once it was finished, SCP-6538 had managed to steal the socks issued to D-1128. 
&gt; 
&gt; Once D-1128 woke up, they dismissed the absence of their socks as them having seemingly tossed them in their sleep and grabbed a pair within one of the drawers. During all of this, the instanced passed by D-1128 several times without them noticing. At some point the instance even stole a fork that D-1128 dropped a few seconds before they bent down to pick up. Further observation showed that the instance appeared to predict where D-1128&#39;s gaze would be a few seconds in advance and moved accordingly to avoid being spotted. Test ended after two days of this repeated behavior.

//__Note.1:__ Why am I not surprised that one of them managed to slip up through our security if we can&#39;t even notice one of them unless we catch them with their pants down. I want all of them to be chipped or counted, something! - Head Researcher Turán//

//__Note.2:__ That&#39;s way too tedious. Chipping or counting an entire colony of children-sized bugs would take ages and is honestly a waste of man-power. A thermal scanner should do the job, at least for an approximation. - Researcher Wasp.//

[[include component:image-block name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Paleolepidopterites_destructus_Cockerell_1916_USNM-HT-no-61998.jpg|caption= First SCP-6538 fossil found.|width=280px]]

The oldest fossil evidence of SCP-6538&#39;s species can be traced back to 129 000 years ago during the Pleistocene period. These ancestors more closely resembled modern moths although much larger in size to the contemporary SCP-6538. Analysis of various preserved individuals show that proportionally to the body, their wings were not large and powerful enough to allow the entities from flying. Similar to modern moths, SCP-6538&#39;s species lacked a mouth and possessed a short lifespan until the start of the Holocene period.

The fusion of the body on SCP-6538&#39;s ancestors can be seen around the start of the Holocene, at this point the species noticeably began to shrink and develop its grasping appendages. SCP-6538&#39;s evolution overlaps with Humanity&#39;s, it is unknown if the species adapted to the growth of humans as a species or is merely a coincidence. Preserved SCP-6538 nests show that the species very rapidly adapted to gathering items  

The first fossil attributed to SCP-6538 was found in 1924 in South Africa, simultaneously to the discovery of the first //Australopithecus// remains. Later discoveries showed that SCP-6538 was present on most of Earth&#39;s continents up until the end of the Holocene. It is unknown what caused such a prolific species to die out and migrate to the northern Americas.

**Senior Researcher Wasp:** Hold your ground my friends! Protect //our// breakroom!

**Several voices:** For the breakroom!

**Addendum 6538.6:** Incident Log IL.6538/1
After several hours of radio silence from a locked down Site-248. MTF Echo-5 &#34;Sting Operation&#34; operatives that were initially relocated for the containment of an unrelated anomaly were called back to assist with de-escalating the situation and lift the site-wide lockdown. The following is a transcript of the video recording captured from Echo-5 Captain Tigris&#39;s body camera.

[[div style=&#34;display: inline-block ; border : dashed 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px&#34;]]
//Video opens up on the operatives entering the East-wing of Site-248 through one of the emergency entrances, red lights lighten the hallways as a lockdown is in effect. The squad can be seen going down a corridor, various items are laid on the ground in various places.//

**Sgt. Csaba:** What the hell happened here, do you think it&#39;s a major breach?

**Cptn. Tigris:** I hope not, we&#39;d have to go all the way to the west-side armory to get the PA-C Mark IIs and I really don&#39;t want to walk all the way there.

//Lt. Zrinyi takes the lead and traverses the hall, passing by the offices. Lt. Zrinyi is surprised by a loud sound coming from one of the offices, the squad can be seen taking their positions either side of the door as one of them leans to look through the door&#39;s window.//

**Cpl. Mareșal:** I see three //&#34;hoarders&#34;//. Gosh they&#39;re really tearing that room apart!

**Lt. Zrinyi:** That&#39;s Turán&#39;s office, man they really got something against him.

//The instances can be seen rampaging inside the room, searching cabinets for things to steal. One of the instances accidentally tips one of the cabinets which almost crushes another one, resulting in a quarrel.//

**Cpl. Mareșal:** Ever since the breakroom incident I hear they&#39;ve been targeting him specifically. They probably hold a grudge over the coffee bag. (//laugh//)

//Video opens up on the operatives sweeping through the corridors looking for personnel, they eventually come across Security Officer Marten carrying a wounded janitor with Agent Boxer.//

**Security Officer Marten:** Hey! (//grunt//)Over here!

**Sgt. Csaba:** Here, let me help.

**Security Officer Marten:** One of the fuckers hit her over the head with a pipe. I don&#39;t even know how the hell they managed to rip that out of the wall.

//Sgt. Csaba can be seen leaving in the direction of the east-wing infirmary with Agent Boxer and the wounded janitor.//

**Cptn. Tigris:** What&#39;s the current situation? 

**Security Officer Marten:** Several people are missing and they got Turán hostage.

**Cpl. Mareșal:** See? Told you. Grudge.

**Lt. Zrinyi:** (//snicker//)

**Cptn. Tigris:** Ahem, right. What about the others?

**Security Officer Marten:** Well you missed the great battle for the breakroom&#39;s coffee machine, we managed to regain territory there with the help of Wasp. The bastard somehow found a shovel and went at them like he was gardenin&#39;.

**Lt. Zrinyi:** Where are they holding Turán though?

**Security Officer Marten:** Well we managed to corner them to the construction tunnel that&#39;s near their actual chamber. We&#39;ve been trying to trade him for stuff but they keep taking the things without real much success, we do hear him cursing in the back so he&#39;s conscious that&#39;s that.

**Cpl. Mareșal:** Any idea how we&#39;ll operate sir? We can&#39;t really gas them because that&#39;ll hit Turán at the same time.

**Cptn. Tigris:** Let me think..

**Lt. Zrinyi:** What if we just went in?

**Cptn. Tigris:** No, there&#39;s even bigger chances that we&#39;ll hit him. Plus we are still tasked to retrieve most of them alive.

**Unknown Voice:** I know what we have to do.

//The group turns as a bloody Senior Researcher Wasp emerges from the end of the hallway, still carrying the shovel.//

**Cpl. Mareșal:** Are you...alright?

**Senior Researcher Wasp:** &#39;Could&#39;ve been better.

**Lt. Zrinyi:** What&#39;s your big idea then, doc?

**Senior Researcher Wasp:** The dispensers that we use to drop shit in their cell makes a very distinct sound, used to make me and Miller crazy. //They// recognise the sound, as they come running every time they hear the buzzing echo inside the chamber.

**Security Officer Marten:** I think I can guess where you&#39;re getting at. If we were to activate all of them at the same time, they should make a sound loud enough to bait those that can recognize it inside the cell!

**Senior Researcher Wasp:** They&#39;ll tell their new friends all about a place where they can find a ton of stuff, hopefully bringing the rest inside.

**Cptn. Tigris:**  There is one single issue however: we can activate the dispensers from a distance, the containment door we can&#39;t.

**Senior Researcher Wasp:** Well what about Miller? He has access to the door control commands.

**Security Officer Marten:** He&#39;s...among the missing. You&#39;re the only one with access here.

**Senior Researcher Wasp:** Fuck.

//Video opens up on Senior Researcher Wasp and Agent Miller inside the control room alone, Echo-5 having left to ensure the escapees make their way only to the chamber. Agent Miller can be seen inspecting the control panel while Senior Researcher Wasp is on the radio.//

**Senior Researcher Wasp:** Alright.. The guys are in position, you can start the dispensing sequence.

**Agent Miller:** Finally..

//Agent Miller starts the sequence. An alarm starts ringing as the instances can be heard screaming in the distance.//

**Senior Researcher Wasp:** They&#39;ll be here any second now, be prepared to close the door.

**Agent Miller:** Joseph. 

**Senior Researcher Wasp:** What?

**Agent Miller:** They completely busted the door control system, the only way to close it is from the emergency panels located inside their room. 

**Senior Researcher Wasp:** But whoever goes in there won&#39;t be able to get back out!

**Agent Miller:** If we don&#39;t close it this whole thing will be for nothing and the breach&#39;s severity will escalate!

//Both stay silent as the alarm continues to ring, the instances can be heard approaching the containment chamber rapidly.//

**Senior Researcher Wasp:** ..I&#39;ll do it.

**Agent Miller:** You&#39;re crazy, you&#39;d never make it out! 

//Senior Researcher Wasp can be seen embracing Agent Miller.//

**Senior Researcher Wasp:** Thank you for having been so patient with this old man.

//As Senior Researcher Wasp makes his way to leave, Agent Miller catches up to him and throws a punch that leaves Senior Researcher Wasp to the ground. Agent Miller can be seen locking the control room door.//

**Senior Researcher Wasp:** Dave! What the hell are you doing, open the door!

//Agent Miller can be seen from the control room window entering the containment chamber and making his way to the control panel at the other end of the room. Senior Researcher Wasp can be heard hitting the glass.//

**Agent Miller:** Can&#39;t do that Jo&#39;, can&#39;t take the risk.

**Senior Researcher Wasp:** Dave, get back here! I&#39;m sure I can still repair the machin-

//The camera slightly shakes as a wave of SCP-6538 instances enters the room.// 

**Cptn. Tigris:** [RADIO] We have access to the hostage, close the door!

**Senior Researcher Wasp:** Fuck! Dave, do it now!

//The door closes as the instances start interacting with the pile of detritus. Eventually, Agent Miller&#39;s presence catches the attention of the mob who start approaching him. Senior Researcher Wasp can be seen talking in the radio before collapsing from exhaustion.//

**5-25-2003 | 13:52:21:** //Agent Miller can be seen laying in a hospital bed, the sound of beeping machines fills the room. A nurse can be seen taking care of Agent Miller&#39;s food tray. Senior Researcher Wasp enters the room soon after.//

**Senior Researcher Wasp:** Thank you Olivia.

**5-25-2003 | 13:52:21:** //The nurse leaves the room. Agent Miller and Senior Researcher Wasp stare at each other in silence.//

**Agent Miller:** Soo-

**Senior Researcher Wasp:** You hit me over the head.

**Agent Miller:** Yeahh, about that.. Sorry?

**Senior Researcher Wasp:** You could have literally just beaten me to the door. You know I don&#39;t do well with stairs since I got my femur split in half.

**Agent Miller:** //Ehh//

**Senior Researcher Wasp:** (//sigh//) I&#39;m glad you&#39;re okay. Anything you&#39;d like to talk about during your time inside that chamber?

**5-25-2003 | 14:10:34:** //Agent Miller blankly stares at Senior Researcher Wasp.//

**Senior Researcher Wasp:** Dave?

**Agent Miller:** I.. I&#39;d rather not talk about it.

//Agent Miller was severely beaten by the colony before being forcefully shoved into the opening of one of the dispensers. We had to extract him through the ducts which took a lot of time and effort, especially after we found out that a few flying-spiders had made a nest in the vents. - Security Officer Marten//

[[size 85%]]Head Researcher Turán[[/size]]

**Head Researcher Turán:** How long is this going to last? I have things to do you know.

**Psychiatrist Emilie:** It&#39;s protocol sir, it won&#39;t last more than an hour.

**Head Researcher Turán:** Right.

**Psychiatrist Emilie:** Let&#39;s see.. What would you say is the part you&#39;re having the most trouble dealing with emotionally?

**Head Researcher Turán:** Emilie. They put me in my underwear and paraded me around the room. 

**Psychiatrist Emilie:** Ouch okay, I was //not// informed of that.

**Head Researcher Turán:** Of course you wouldn&#39;t, that room had no working surveillance system. The little gremlins ripped it out of the wall and were using it to &#34;film&#34; me as I was moved around. I could feel them looking at me with their soulless little red eyes, almost as if they were judging me.

//The incident lasted 12 hours, leading to most of the East-wing of Site-248 being completely ravaged by the amount of loose SCP-6538. The repairs took several weeks and I don&#39;t even want to look at how much it costed. Several personnel were wounded with various levels of severity during the incident. Thankfully Agent Dave Miller&#39;s selfless sacrifice resulted in Site-248&#39;s integrity being restored. Head Researcher Ervin Turán was taken hostage by the instances during the incident, he was mostly shaken up but he quickly recovered.//

//The strangest thing is though, what we know of the &#34;hoarder bugs&#34; completely contradicts their behavior during this incident. They would normally seek and retrieve as many items as they could to bring back to the nest. But here? Here they were more dead-set on wrecking things up than looting, we did see some looting occurring but not to the extent that a hundred worth of individuals could do. The previous count of 54 contained individuals rose up to almost 130, and that&#39;s not counting the dozens of instances possibly still loose in the site. Every day we get a new report about tools disappearing or actual witnesses seeing one in the middle of stealing. The large individual believed to be the leader and instigator of this breach was not captured during the clean-up of the east-wing and is believed to still be loose in the site.//

//For now it was decided to split the colony in half and allocate two containment chambers: one in the east-wing and one in the west-wing, to house them. More measures are going to be taken to ensure a more efficient reaction and prevention to hopefully not repeat the mistakes that happened that day. Many more colonies of SCP-6538 may very well be present in the wild, it is our duty to locate and contain them before they become a threat to the nearby populace.//
