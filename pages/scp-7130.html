**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7130 is held in a standard humanoid containment cell. Site personnel are to enter SCP-7130’s cell at maximum once per day, this is done to be sure SCP-7130-1 has not been warped out of it’s cell. 

To prevent the warping of SCP-7130-1 to SCP-7130-2, foundation staff must simply be present and make sure all doors and other accesses to the containment cell are closed airtight.

If foundation personnel get to SCP-7130’s cell after he has already been warped, Protocol-Dream-walk must be executed. One or more foundation personnel must enter SCP-7130-2 with full hazmat and anti-reality-warping suits. They are also to return to the containment cell by an hour, even if they could not find SCP-7130-1.

**Description:** SCP-7130-1 is a humanoid anomaly, 1.8 meters in height. It is widely regarded to be a male, because of it’s appearance and voice. There are no distinct features present anywhere on SCP-7130-1, for he is a white figure. The only clothing that could be made out on SCP-7130, is a coat and a fedora, both also completely white. 

Although SCP-7130 does not have a visible mouth, he is capable of speaking perfect English in a British accent. It does not appear that he knows any other language, though he is very capable of understanding and conversing with foundation personnel. SCP-7130-1 is widely considered completely harmless.

Multiple varieties of scans, including X-ray, and MRI, have been done on SCP-7130-1 multiple times, though all the machines do not pick up a single thing from SCP-7130-1’s body.

SCP-7130-1 claims to control all dreams in the world. It has stated that it could control any dream to it’s desire while he’s in SCP-7130-2. This claim is taken lightly by most foundation personnel, since they can still have dreams while SCP-7130-1 is not inside SCP-7130-2.

SCP-7130-2 is a reality outside of our own that can be easily accessed by SCP-7130-1 and foundation personnel through a “gate” as called by SCP-7130-1, to SCP-7130-2. This reality is beyond what is possibly comprehensible by the human mind, for it does seem to have implications that it commands the human mind. Most foundation personnel who have attempted to describe what they’ve seen, describe it as a random mix of colours and illusion.

SCP-7130-2 will occasionally attempt to take SCP-7130-1 into itself. Although SCP-7130-1 can perfectly survive in SCP-7130-2, it is hard for it to escape, 
and SCP-7130-1 seems to much prefer it’s containment cell.

SCP-7130-2 is able to be entered from a gateway, or portal, that will be open in SCP-7130’s containment cell when SCP-7130-1 is “taken” by it. This is the gateway used during Protocol-Dream-Walk.

**Interviewed:** **SCP-7130-1**

**Interviewer:** **Dr. Lee Hartwel**

**Foreword:** The following is an interview log made by Senior Researcher Dr. Lee Hartwel, in which he interrogates SCP-7130-1 with certain questions and topics he wished to discuss.

**&lt;Begin Log, 2:37 PM&gt;**

**Dr. Hartwel:** Hello sir, I am only here to ask you a few questions, if you are okay with that.

**SCP-7130-1:** Of course, you may proceed.

**Dr. Hartwel:** Firstly, to make this log easier, what should I call you?

**SCP-7130-1:** That doesn’t concern me much. I’m okay with SCP-7130-1, or any other given name.

**Dr. Hartwel:** I’ll call you sir for the sake of convenience. So- sir, do you mind explaining the dream realm, SCP-7130-2, and how it works?

**SCP-7130-1:** I’ll attempt to make this brief. The dream realm, as you call it, is a place where I can form, and distribute dreams. It can do this on its own as well, though it’ll only last a while, which is why it forces me to enter once in a while. It’s fair really, i perceive it as the universe attempting to work properly.

**Dr. Hartwel:** That makes sense. Now, why exactly are you here, sir?

**SCP-7130-1:** I suppose you don’t mean for the interview. As for how I’m here, in your (//he pauses, seemingly thinking for the right word//) realm should be the suitable word. The reason I’m here is because of a human, a woman. Originally, I was not meant to appear in peoples dreams, but I did accidentally once. The woman, who’s dream I found myself in, was present in the dream. I believe you all call that- lucid dreaming. She showed me the world, but I wanted to see for myself. This planet of yours is much better than the place I was before, I wish to stay here as long as I can.

**Dr. Hartwel:** Of course. Im going to ask you a question you may not know how to answer. Do you know- exactly who you are?

**SCP-7130-1:** (//he pauses for a moment, as if pondering an answer//) No, I don’t believe I do.

**Dr. Hartwel:** That’s alright. Would you be able to describe what it’s like to control dreams for me? Maybe that will give me a better idea of who you are.

**SCP-7130-1:** It’s a difficult question you asked. I’m not sure I can explain it to perfection. Controlling dreams…well, I see and feel every human emotion at once. I suffer, cry, but I’m also ecstatic at the same time. I also see every memory of every person, the good, the bad, everything, I never miss one. I have to fight through these emotions, and I take them all, and turn them into what humans call dreams. I like to think of dreams as a sloppy mix of memories and emotions.

**Dr. Hartwel:** I believe I understood that just fine. You mentioned a woman, who brought you here. May you elaborate on who she is, and have you met her yet- here?

**SCP-7130-1:** You know the answer to this question. She works here, that’s how I was contained. Isabelle Garcia, assistant researcher. She dreamt one night, and I happened to be there. She convinced me to leave so I followed. When I arrived, she was frightened, thought it was only in her dreams. I was, but now I was there, standing in front of her, and she stabbed me in the back, turning me in to the foundation. I genuinely don’t mind anymore- for I like it here, I have everything I need, which is ironically a cell with nothing in it.

**Dr. Hartwel:** I do not have any further questions, would you like to say anything else.

**SCP-7130-1:** I’m sure you have hundreds of questions you can formulate right now, but I on the other hand, have no answers, or statements in general.

**Dr. Hartwel:** Then this concludes our log, thank you for sitting down to talk to me, sir.

**SCP-7130-1:** (//He nods his head//)

**&lt;End Log, 2:47 PM&gt;**

**Protocol-Dream-Walk #23 Video Log Transcript**

**Date:** September 23, 2014

**Exploration Team:** DreamWalkers-Alpha

**Subject:** SCP-7130-2

**Team Members:** Markus Lancaster, Jason Shepard

**Communications Lead:** Jonathan Hudson
-----

[BEGIN LOG]

**Lancaster:** We’re in. Everything is stable as of now. Hudson do you copy?

**Hudson:** I’m here. You may proceed, everything on my end is doing just fine.

//Lancaster helps Shepard down and begins to walk cautiously through the confusing environment of SCP-7130-2.//

**Shepard:** How exactly are we going about this?

**Lancaster:** Give me a moment.

//Lancaster attaches a metal tube to both his and Shepard’s suits, connecting them.//

**Lancaster:** You go left, I go right, don’t go too far though, the tube can disconnect.

**Hudson:** Be quick, you two have 55 minutes until you need to return.

**Shepard:** You heard him.

//Both make their way in parallel directions//

//Roughly nine minutes after//

**Hudson:** Have you two made contact with anything?

**Shepard:** Define anything.

//silence//

**Lancaster:** He’s asking if you’ve found anyone.

**Shepard:** Nothing. Nada. Just, headaches, this place is a headache.

**Lancaster:** I couldn’t agree more, but we have to continue, we have limited time, and God knows how big this place is. No more jokes.

**Shepard:** Not a joke, Markus. Headaches, real headaches.

//No one replies. Both Lancaster and Shepard continue walking.//

//Roughly seventeen minutes after//

**Shepard:** (//Humming to a made up tune//)

**Lancaster:** Please, shut up, I need to concentrate, really.

**Shepard:** Alright. What’s going on on your- holy shit- it’s right there.

**Hudson:** Perfect, get his attention and get him onto the cart.

**Shepard:** What cart? I don’t have it.

**Lancaster:** Oh fuck, I took both of them.

**Shepard:** Jesus Christ, Markus, my job got more confusing than I thought was achievable.

**Lancaster:** Not my fault, you took the-

**Hudson:** Shepard, you have a back up cart, stop arguing. It’s on your hip to your left. Open the hatch and use it.

//Shepard does as instructed.//

**Shepard:** Approaching the anomaly.

**Hudson:** Perfect. Don’t scare it.

**Shepard:** It’s not a stray dog.

//Shepard approaches SCP-7130-1. He begins to snap in front of where it’s face would be as if to get it’s attention. SCP-7130-1 is seen becoming alert, getting out of its seemingly dormant state.//

**SCP-7130-1:** (//speaking frantically//) two billion seven hundred thirty six million three hundred ninety seven thousand four hundred and six humans dreaming. 37 percent of which are nightmares. Millions of heartbreaks and deaths, but millions of college acceptance letters and moments of euphoria. Help them, help the humans, for their emotions are too much, so much, so much, so, so much.

**Shepard:** (//visibly confused and panicked//) Hey this //is// my first rodeo, so can you cooperate, you aren’t meant to be this frantic.

//SCP-7130-1 cooperates without hesitation, frantically getting in the cart.//

**SCP-7130-1:** Out, out, get me out of here.

**Hudson:** Listen to it, you have about thirty minutes or so left. That isn’t a lot of time.

**Shepard:** On it.

**Hudson:** You too, Lancaster.

**Lancaster:** Alright.

//They both make their way back to the gateway, following their “Dream-Walking” tubes.//

**Hudson:** Proceed with caution.

**Shepard:** (//Climbing through the gateway, pulling the cart upwards with him//) Where’s Markus?

//After a minute goes by, Lancaster is seen walking towards Shepard.//

**Lancaster:** I hope I didn’t take //too// long. (//He helps push the cart up as he climbs himself//)

**Shepard:** You did.

**Hudson:** Interrupting the awkwardness, this marks our mission a success. Good job to both of you.
