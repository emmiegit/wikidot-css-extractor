[[size 120%]] **UIU File 2020-650:** Case File &#34;The Many Man&#34;[[/size]]

**Summary:**  Suspect has the ability to create an unknown number of perfect replications of himself as well as the ability to manufacture a para-narcotic which gives the user temporary use of said abnormality.
[[/div]]
[[/tab]]
[[tab Suspect Description/Capabilities]]

**Name:**  Elliott Perez (Most common alias). Other names given include Ezekiel Parrington, Jared O&#39;Sullivan, and Kirby Danton.

**Irregularity Cross-reference:** Italian, Human, Fugitive, Duplication, Paranarcotic, MC&amp;D

**Physical Description:**
||~ Sex ||~ Height ||~ Weight/Build ||~ Race ||~ Hair ||~ Eyes ||~ Identifying Attributes ||
|| Male || 5&#39;11 || 160lbs || Italian ||  Black || Brown || Dresses well, commonly seen wearing black square glasses ||

**Capabilities:** Suspect is capable of creating an unknown amount of perfect recreations of themselves and the ability to manufacture a para-narcotic which gives the user temporary use of said abnormality. Through several arrests of the suspects’ duplicates, it has been discovered that each has full sapience and free will.

**Purpose/Motive:** Suspect appears to be operating for the pursuit of monetary gain and power within the high-class para-criminal community.

**Modus Operandi:** Suspect primarily collaborates with duplicates of themselves, using their abnormality to aid in the manufacturing and distribution of para-narcotic substances.

**Behavior:** Suspect is said to be extremely charming and intelligent. It should be noted that the suspect maintains a relatively high profile, appearing at most Marshall, Carter, and Dark social functions selling his products. The suspect is considered armed and dangerous. Agents are recommended to approach the suspect with caution.

**A: Recovered Marshal Carter &amp; Dark Documentation of Illegal Substance Sold By Suspect**

The following text documents a para-narcotic manufactured by suspect. Said documentation was recovered by UIU operatives during a raid on a small-scale Marshall, Carter, and Dark auction unrelated to the current investigation.
-----
||||~ DS5297/C39875/F46A35 ||
||~ Status||Selling ||
||~ Demand||Medium ||
||~ Value||20,000 USD/14,363.17 GBP per 1.2 grams ||
||~ Availability|| Established Supply Chain||
||~ Identifier|| Duplication Dust||
||~ Description|| &#34;Duplication Dust&#34; is a powder-based narcotic that, when inhaled, allows the user to painlessly create a perfect duplicate of themselves. The duplicate&#39;s mental and physical abilities are the same as the original user. Note that it is not uncommon for duplicates that have been alive for an extended period of time to develop unique personalities. _
 _
It has been discovered that duplicates are required to inhale 1.2 grams of Duplication Dust once every 24 hours for the effects to persist longer than the period acquired from the first dosage. ||

||||||||~ Initial Report||
||~ Author || Victoria Marshall ||~ Date || June 29, 2018||
||~ Interest||Medium||~ Identifier||Duplication Dust||
||||||||I first observed Elliott Perez at one of father’s social gatherings, his charismatic charm showing through as he chatted with the other attending guests. As the night progressed I happened to move by him and that’s when he introduced himself. _
 _
Mr. Carter, Ms. Dark, and I exchanged formalities with Mr. Perez. He spoke at length of his rather…interesting entrepreneurial endeavors, one of which in particular caught our attention. A &#34;para-narcotic&#34; as he put it, and the way he talked so highly of it, anyone could tell that it was quite popular, not to mention lucrative. We of course heard him out on this, Mr. Perez says that his so-called para-narcotic has made him quite the fortune (an estimated sum of $250,000,000) and he was quite insistent that with the assistance of Marshall Carter and Dark, LLP. he could make himself and the company (the company more so, of course) much, much more. _
 _
Mr. Carter will finish writing up the contract by next Saturday.||

**Current Status:** At large.

**Crimes:** Making and dealing of narcotic substances, Knowing creation of a hazardous anomalous object,  Circulation of anomalous objects, Collaboration with a known criminal organization(s).

**Sentencing:** Indefinite detention.

**History of UIU Action:**

__5/25/2020:__ The UIU is notified of irregular activity around the exterior of Marshall, Carter, and Dark&#39;s Three Portlands auction house. Reports of a large gathering of identical-looking individuals entering the auction house carrying several large crates of an unidentified substance are received.

__6/5/2020:__ A thorough investigation is performed on the suspected irregularity. Through several investigations and interrogation attempts, suspect&#39;s irregularity was confirmed and a UIU file was created. A warrant for the arrest of Elliott Perez is issued soon after.    
 
__6/20/2020:__  Through an anonymous tip the UIU learns that suspect is using a Marshall, Carter, and Dark warehouse to store his anomalous narcotics. UIU agents are sent out to the location of the before mentioned warehouse, the location was vacated of the suspect. 30 crates of para-narcotic substances, as well as a helicopter presumably owned by the suspect, were confiscated from the location.

__12/17/2020:__ Agents are able to track down the location where the suspect manufactures most if not all para-narcotic substances. Due to the presence of heavy security it was deemed that an arrest of the suspect would be prohibitively expensive. An observation post is set up across the street from the suspects’ location, plans as well as resources needed to successfully raid the building and detain the suspect begin being gathered until such a time where detainment is deemed possible.   
 
__3/28/2021:__ UIU agents operating within Three Portlands Observation Post &#34;Delta&#34; notice a gap in suspects’ personal security. Authorization by headquarters for agents to move in and detain the suspect is given. Breaking into teams of two agents move around the buildings perimeter, detaining the duplicates present. Half of the agents in attendance remain outside in order to maintain guard over the buildings exterior, while the other half enter to apprehend the suspect. Agents take a total of 35 minutes to clear the building. After a thorough search throughout the building, it was concluded that the suspect had vacated the premises, presumably through a complex network of underground tunnels located below the surrounding area.

I feel my hard work is finally paying off. Was graciously invited to a Marshall,  Carter, and Dark social gathering this evening. I must remember to thank Mara for introducing me.

__**To-Do:**__
-Socialize, need to extend me to as many circles as possible, could be useful.
-Manage to catch MC&amp;D, one or all. Whichever is most convenient.
-Try a new drink, heard good things about the Mojito.

Success. Managed to secure a nice chat with MC&amp;D thanks to, of all things Mr. Marshall&#39;s kid Victoria, lovely young woman.

Pitched my product, they seemed quite interested. Interested enough to allow me to have meeting to secure a meeting in private to discuss the finer details.

Try to go for %60, do **not** let them play you for a fool. Going to take these fuckers for all they got.

Shit. Careless, careless, careless.  I&#39;m positive those UIUseless agents saw us delivering our newest DD shipment. I gotta bring this up with Mr. Carter, he&#39;s going to have my head on a goddamn pike.

**To-Do:**
-Speak with Carter.
-Lay low.
-Use that favor Mara owes you.

To the agents who have decided to fuck everything up,

Could you not just leave us well alone? Why must you insist on making everything I do so much more difficult?  Please do everyone a service and **fuck** off.

P.S. I want my journal back. How Ironic of you to call me a criminal when you insist on stealing all my shit.
