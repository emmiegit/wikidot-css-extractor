**Item #:** SCP-248-DE

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-248-DE is to be kept inside the secured drawer No. 7 of safety storage closet K-24 in containment unit H26/Wing-05 of Site-19-DE.[[footnote]]Said room is intended to store tiny Safe-class anomalies in the form of tools and smaller devices.[[/footnote]] The object&#39;s storage room is to be secured via a safety door, with the drawer featuring two combination locks. The door leading into the storage room is to be secured using a magnetic lock with an ID scanner to evade unauthorized access. Access to SCP-248-DE is permitted solely to personnel of level 2 clearance or higher and only with the consent of a level 3 overseer. SCP-248-DE may only be removed from its drawer for experimental purposes. If this need arises, gloves made of synthetic material are to be worn. No other cutlery may be present around SCP-248-DE in a 2 m radius.

**Description:** SCP-248-DE describes a four-pronged dinner fork measuring 25 cm and weighing 43 g that consists of a stainless steel alloy and [REDACTED]. According to analyses, SCP-248-DE inhabits the feature to make almost any material edible, including liquids and some gases. If any given material is pricked via the object (e.g. in a steel beam), it will extract a bite-sized piece, whose consistency will change in a matter that will enable a person to eat it without any problems. However, this effect can solely occur when SCP-248-DE gains direct skin contact. It has been reported that the taste of the eaten material has consistently been perceived as pleasant, with the consumed &#34;food&#34; thus seemingly being exceedingly delicious (Refer to Test Protocol 248-1). As long as SCP-248-DE is held in one&#39;s hand, it will not harm the eater. Should SCP-248-DE be placed near other cutlery, it will begin to immediately absorb the latter. The object&#39;s mass will not shift during this process (Refer to Addendum 1).

Initially, SCP-248-DE has been discovered on the ██.██.19██ in █████████, Lower Saxony in the basement of an abandoned pub in the midst of a forest by Agent ████, who, coincidentally, was hiking in said area. While exploring the premises, SCP-248-DE fell from a shelf in the cellar kitchen of the pub, sinking almost to the shaft into the ground. Being amazed, the agent attempted to pull out the object, thereby extracting a bite-sized piece from the floor. Agent B████ reported that the floor piece from SCP-248-DE scented extraordinarily delicious and he was unable to resist the urge to carefully take a bite. This led to Agent B████ eating half a square meter of the floor, regardless of the hygienic conditions of the decrepit cellar room. Therefore, it is not to be excluded that SCP-248-DE may possess memetic abilities. At Site-DE██, agent B████ transferred the object to the foundation the next day.

Two weeks following SCP-248-DE&#39;s discovery, on the ██.██.19██, agent B████ received an anonymous package. All information about the sender was missing and later analyses neither found fingerprints nor traces of DNA on the package or its content. The package contained a plain black diary bound in leather. Obviously, the owner&#39;s name was retroactively removed, due to every spot mentioning him has been scratched beyond recognition.

The diary shows that SCP-248-DE has apparently been constructed to serve the purpose of initiating the third world war by using SCP-248-DE to absorb and subsequently destroy all the world&#39;s cutlery, thereby triggering a &#34;worldwide fight&#34; around the ultimate fork. It can be assumed the author of the diary was psychologically disturbed to a certain extent. For the creation of the object only information about the usage of a book about the &#34;███████████ cult&#39;s rites&#34; was found. How exactly this was put into practice, is yet to be determined, as any further information about it was rendered unrecognizable by scratched text passages and ripped out, thus lost pages.

&gt; **Test subject:** D-26683, male, 23
&gt; **Supervision:** Dr. ██████ █████, leading researcher for SCP-248-DE
&gt; **Purpose:** Tests with different materials for consumption, observing the results

&gt; **Date:** 23.04.199█
&gt; **Material:** Frozen meat
&gt; **Subject:** D-26683
&gt; **Interaction:** Subject D-6683 takes a seat on a given table and gets served a frozen ham hock.
&gt; 
&gt; The subject is instructed to pick up SCP-248-DE and eat a bite of hock.
&gt; 
&gt; D-26683 shortly shrugs shoulders, grabs SCP-248-DE, and pricks the hock. The object glides effortlessly into the hard frozen meat, whereafter a perfectly bite-sized piece of the material becomes loose. Apparently, the piece did not change, thereby still seeming to be frozen.
&gt; 
&gt; D-26683 consumes the material, reporting it to seem pleasantly warm and well cooked through. It described the taste as exceedingly delicate.
&gt; 
&gt; The ham hock is removed from the table.

&gt; **Date:** 23.04.199█
&gt; **Material:** Vegetable soup
&gt; **Subject:** D-26683
&gt; **Interaction:** Subject D-26683 is served a bowl of clear vegetable soup.
&gt; 
&gt; The subject is instructed to grab SCP-248-DE to eat a bit from the soup.
&gt; 
&gt; D-26683 grabs SCP-248-DE, dipping it into the soup. When lifted out, it can be observed that a bubble of soup has settled onto the object. The liquid does not run between the tines.
&gt; 
&gt; The subject eats the &#34;bite&#34; of soup and reports that there is no difference in consumption via a spoon. It described that taste as very delicious.
&gt; 
&gt; The soup is removed.

&gt; **Date:** 23.04.199█
&gt; **Material:** Wood
&gt; **Subject:** D-26683
&gt; **Interaction:** The subject is served a wooden block (Dimensions: 15 x 15 x 20 cm, Material: Beech)
&gt; 
&gt; **D-26683:** &#34;Are you serious?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████:** &#34;Yes. Continue!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **D-26683:** &#34;But I can&#39;t eat wood.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████:** &#34;Yes, you can, and you will. Proceed!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; The subject reluctantly picks up SCP-248-DE and pricks it into the wood block. The object effortlessly glides into the material, extracting a bite-sized piece of wood.
&gt; 
&gt; Subject D-26683 hesitates shortly, before cautiously leading SCP-248-DE to the mouth, eating the &#34;wood bite&#34;. The astonished subject reports that the bite was of smooth, well-chewable consistency. It described the taste as pleasantly nutty with a slight wood flavor.
&gt; 
&gt; The wooden block is removed from the table.
&gt; 
&gt; The subject is escorted back into its cell.

&gt; **Date:** 12.05.199█
&gt; **Material:** Paper/Cardboard
&gt; **Subject:** D-26683
&gt; **Interaction:** The subject is served a book.
&gt; 
&gt; Slightly hesitantly, the subject picks up SCP-248-DE, pricking into the book. The object effortlessly glides into the book here as well, extracting a bite-sized piece. A piece of pages and cover is placed on SCP-248-DE.
&gt; 
&gt; Subject D26683 eats the bite, reporting that it perceived the consistency as being creamy, but he could still feel the separate layers of the pages. The taste reminded it of vanilla with a slight hint of wafer. He also described this flavor as unbelievably delicate.
&gt; 
&gt; The book is removed from the table.

&gt; **Date:** 12.05.199█
&gt; **Material:** Steel
&gt; **Subject:** D-26683
&gt; **Interaction:** The subject is served a massive steel cube (20 x 20 x 20 cm) as well as a synthetic leather glove, corresponding to the subject&#39;s dominant hand.
&gt; 
&gt; The subject is instructed to put on the synthetic glove (surgical glove, latex) and then grab SCP-248-DE.
&gt; 
&gt; D-26683 attempts to prick SCP-248-DE into the material, but it does not penetrate. It appears that its anomalous properties are suppressed as long as its held by a person, whose hand is dressed in a synthetic glove.
&gt; 
&gt; The subject removes the subject by order and undertakes a new attempt. As usual, the object penetrates the material and extracts a bite-sized piece.
&gt; 
&gt; The subject eats the bite and reports a nougat-like consistency; the taste is described as &#34;insanely fruity, first class&#34;.
&gt; 
&gt; The subject is instructed to put on the leather glove and grab SCP-248-DE.
&gt; 
&gt; The subject follows orders and utilizes SCP-248-DE once more. The object penetrates the material as anticipated, once again extracting a bite-sized piece.
&gt; 
&gt; The subject describes the consistency and taste as usual.
&gt; 
&gt; //Remark: Apparently, the object needs direct skin contact or skin-like organic material in order to show its properties to that extent.// - Dr. █████
&gt; 
&gt; The security personnel struggles to remove the subject from the table, as it refuses to stand up, so it can eat even more of the steel cube. A sedative is administered; subject D-26683 is removed from the testing chamber.

&gt; **Date:** 23.05.199█
&gt; **Material:** D-26683
&gt; **Subject:** D-26683
&gt; **Interaction:** The subject shall attempt to eat itself. The task is to find out how SCP-248-DE reacts to the eater himself.
&gt; 
&gt; The subject refused. After he was instilled with a small dosage of SCP-███-DE, the subject still reacted reluctantly.
&gt; 
&gt; D-26683 showed signs of severe nausea as it attempted to prick the object into its upper thigh. The subject energetically tried to extract a piece from its thigh, while it repeatedly vomited onto itself, but is unable to penetrate its skin via SCP-248-DE. Following a few unsuccessful attempts, the test was terminated.
&gt; 
&gt; When attempting to prepare the subject for its transfer to its cell, it abruptly attacked on of the guards with SCP-248-DE, thereby extracting a piece from the guard&#39;s right arm. D-26683 seemed very apathetic and shouted uncontrollably. As a result of the attack, the subject was terminated via shot to the head.
&gt; 
&gt; During the incident, SCP-248-DE fell down and remained stuck in the ground, sunk to the stem. This was also observed during the object&#39;s discovery. SCP-248-DE showed therefore its primary anomalous function, even without interaction by a life form.
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-248-DE was excavated and transferred to its containment cell. The mortal remainders of D-26683 were added to physical extermination.
&gt; Following adequate first aid measures, the injured guard was transferred to the infirmary.
&gt; 
&gt; Examinations of whether or not the sudden increase in aggression is connected to SCP-███-DE&#39;s presence in the blood is still ongoing.
 
&gt; Further testing with different subjects concluded that all subjects perceived the flavors of their respective materials in the same manner. How exactly SCP-248-DE adds its specific flavors to the meals to be consumed is currently unknown and is subject to further research.

**Appendix:** The usage of SCP-███-DE to subdue subjects is prohibited for the time being.

SCP-248-DE is able to absorb other non-anomalous cutlery once contact has been established. This was detected on ██.██.199█ 18:56, when it was carelessly placed inside a cutlery drawer inside the cafeteria of building [DATA REMOVED] inside Site-19-DE. Tests concluded the impact radius of SCP-248-DE to be around 1.5 meters and only affects cutlery not obstructed through any obstacles (e.g. cabinet walls). It could not be found out how the object was able to leave its secure area. Staff surveys did not yield useful or highly contradictory results.

&gt; **Remark:** //That no explanation concerning this incident was granted is not completely true. At least, if I had been asked. As should be known universally (which was not the case and that is egregious!), SCP-248-DE was carelessly held inside an unsecured device storage room for years. In my opinion, the cause for all of this should rather be inspected, and why no one has done anything to retrieve the object inside its proper storage. We are better at this.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Anyway, this object fell into the hands of a maintenance worker, who, after coincidentally discovering the object&#39;s possibilities, began to eat pieces of the walls and setup of a nearby common room. Frivolously, he stowed the object in a cutlery drawer in the cafeteria at the end, without reporting the object. Without the absorbing abilities of SCP-248-DE, the incident would have remained under lock, until a person grabbed it.//
&gt; 
&gt; //I just wanted to clarify this point.//
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. B█████ █████████

&gt; **Appendix:** //On the 24.██.19██, Dr. █████████ was detained and transferred to security division for questioning.//
&gt; 
&gt; Gerhardt ██████, leader for security, Wing-05, Division A

With no prior contact established with the surrounding cutlery, said cutlery was observed to slowly liquefy and be absorbed by SCP-248-DE. The object&#39;s mass did not shift during this process. It could not be found if and where exactly the absorbed cutleries are transferred. During testing, a sum of 350 knives, forks, and eating spoons were absorbed, without visible and/or measurable changes taking place on SCP-248-DE. The absorbance of cutlery also has no effect on the primary anomalous function of the object. It is currently unknown why SCP-248-DE shows this effect in the vicinity of non-anomalous cutlery and why it solely absorbs these objects.

As it is uncertain if a risk of security could arise through this effect, it is not allowed to bring any cutlery near the impact zone of SCP-248-DE, with the exception being for testing purposes during authorized experiments.
