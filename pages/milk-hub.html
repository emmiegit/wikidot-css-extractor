The Project GALAXIAS Senior Advisory Table thinks we&#39;ve finally arrived at the precipice of a paradigm shift. Work is accelerating at a pace few can keep up with, and the scheduled lactic intake has again been increased, now for the fifth week straight.

As I perch in my bunk, at half-past-four, I feel faraway stars piercing through to my room. Their cross-spectrum light finds its way. I feel for all the world that they leer at me alone.

My gut can&#39;t take anymore. I&#39;m in a constant, ice-cold sweat. My spinal column arches like a dying mare in childbirth. My arms and legs dangle off the bed, annexed from my body, heavy as the world can bear. I can no longer manage the aching in my temples. And in my fevered state, the ceiling, ever expanding, has stretched to alien reaches. The acute senses that comprise my experience have been gouged from my being and placed in a foreign amphitheatre, of an impossibly gargantuan scale. My head spins from untold distances across needle-thin track. //Again. Again.//

I feel the Cosmos. Its unfathomable expanse has been squeezed down to fit within my peripheral nervous system.

All these are adverse effects, so they say, of having survived a passing glance at Eternity. Apotheosis is being administered in adrenal pinpricks across the inside of my raw skin.

I don&#39;t know who or what to believe.

O, [[span style=&#34;filter: blur(.25rem);&#34;]]ANAGAIA[[/span]], how She torments me. I have barely grazed against the afterthoughts of Her afterthoughts, yet my screams carry for ten thousand light-years. They impugn me for things inexplicable, beyond mortal control. Alas, I was not born with a ruminant digestive tract.

I could never bear the teat. In no form even thinkable could I withstand its nourishing expectancy. Instead, I languish. A constellation of agony rips across my psycho–oneirically imposed outer edges. The ones She imposed. The ones my superiors believed would vitalize my putrid form.

How much more can my mind and body bear? Or have I been consigned to a suffering that knows no limits?

+* Lactic Anomalies
+++* A Taxonomical Approach
----
[[/div]]

We divide Lactic Phenomena into two clades: Major and Minor.

Major Lactic Phenomena are phenomena in which milk is undeniably and incontrovertibly a central part of the anomaly in question. They consist of:

# Livestock as producers of milk.
# Milk as a symbol of motherhood.
# The religious significance of milk.
# The societal rhythms and understandings created by the prevalence of milk in our society.

Minor Lactic Phenomena, in contrast, are phenomena in which milk is of enough importance that understanding the anomalies through a Lactic lens may aid in containment, but where other aspects of the anomaly take primacy. The phenomena collected here are:

# Curdled milk byproduct, AKA cheese.
# Non-livestock milk-producing bozomorphic organisms, AKA clowns.
# Incidental appearances of milk that are given undue importance in otherwise unrelated anomalies.

There is overlap among each of these categories, but most anomalies are principally associated with one primary class.

Today, in the early 21st century, the global dairy industry is worth over US$ 800 billion. It is industrial in every sense of the word. The act of milking has become fully mechanized. Animal husbandry has been distilled to a science. Complex networks of dairy conglomerates (which are practically governments unto themselves) transport milk products from farm to table and across the world.

[[div class=&#34;indented end-mark&#34;]]
But the modern-day braiding of the dairy industry with institutions of law and governance is only the latest iteration of a practice that began at the dawn of human history.

What remains unclear is how long ago the human species first started cultivating animals for the purpose of harvesting their milk. It is highly likely that the first humans aware of milk-drinking had become so after observing the interactions between mother animals and their young. However, it is unnatural that human beings can drink milk at all. Most adult humans — except for select groups in Europe and the Middle East that exhibit rare genetic mutations — have lactose intolerance.

Yet this biological inability for humans (past the age of early adolescence) to digest milk did not stop modern humans from continuing to do so. Milk was an incredibly useful nutrition source. It was renewable and did not hurt or kill the animals that produced it. Furthermore, milk had a higher energy density than water, and, crucially, tended to be safer than water, which was not potable unless boiled. There were early evolutionary pressures to learn how to drink milk, thereby further developing the ability to do so via evolution.

The availability of the milk-producing animal bridged the gap between the nomad and the farmer. Both nomadic and sedentary cultures tended milk-producing creatures — be they cows, goats, or camels — for the purpose of harvesting their milk. For the nomad, milk was portable; for the farmer, it was clean. In this way, milk motivated the establishment of social structures that incentivized the safe and reliable production of itself. Therefore, milk, alongside agriculture and brewing, may have laid the foundations for modern conceptions of the State.

The human appetite for milk has been insatiable. In the modern era, millions of cows are kept hooked up to milking machines: Kept alive solely to produce milk. Cows are selectively bred for higher milk yields, and governments administer billions of dollars in subsidies to their respective dairy industries.

We would be remiss not to mention the various plant-based beverages colloquially known as “milks” and “creams” throughout the world. These substitutes for animal milk reflect the dominance of milk as a drink, such that, when it cannot be consumed, a substitute is found. Plant-based milk is inherently less water-consumptive and deleterious to the baseline human digestive system, although this depends on the biological traits of the specific individual.

The sheer number of milk-producing animals currently being farmed — which are needed to sustain humanity&#39;s dependence on the modern lacto–industrial complex — naturally encourages the manifestation of bovine anomalies.

Additionally, they can expel this gas through their anuses and ignite it, presumably using an unidentified flame-producing organ located within the lower digestive system. SCP-5665 instances are able to move in the same manner as a non-anomalous cow; however, they have been observed to instead favour propelling themselves via combustion of their anomalous flatulence. Despite the high temperatures and pressures SCP-5665 are subjected to, they appear to be unaffected physically by this method of transportation.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]As displayed in Addendum 5665.001, SCP-5665 instances are also immune to the effects of air resistance, including the rise in temperatures.[[/span]]

[[div class=&#34;narration justified&#34;]]
++* 1[[span]].2[[/span]] Motherhood
----
The first time that most human beings encounter milk is from their mother&#39;s nipple. Consuming milk, therefore, instinctively recalls the experience of breastfeeding. It is a fundamental reminder of the second home after the womb: The mother&#39;s bosom. Indeed, even after being weaned from the teat, the human being often desires to return to it, thereby becoming trapped in endless epicycles of return to the womb. The societal association between milk and motherhood entwines milk with conceptions of femininity and its own role in society.

[[div class=&#34;indented end-mark&#34;]]
It is interesting that the human newborn instinctively knows the smell of the mother&#39;s nipple: When it is placed near a woman&#39;s nipple, it instinctively heads towards it and seeks to feed. The attraction to milk is located within the human species — within all mammals. This trait is so central to the class Mammalia that it is, thus, named after the mammary.

Whereas most animals stop drinking their mothers&#39; milk after early infancy, the human creature continues. However, the human being does not drink its own mother&#39;s milk in perpetuity; instead, it drinks the milk of other species. In effect, the human being has tied itself to the womb, tied itself to the nipple, tied itself to the teat so firmly that it replaces its own mother with another animal.

Even so, motherhood plays a vital role in human societies. Let us consider the discredited thoughts of Sigmund Freud. Freud, infamously, was known for desiring his own mother, and described such desires in detail. Crucially, Freud had not been weaned by his mother, but instead by a wet nurse, and when he gazed upon his mother&#39;s breasts, he became aroused. He was deprived of a deeply human experience by the realities of the society in which he lived. A society that, at the time, demanded mothers pass the duty of feeding their children onto those of a lower class — ergo, the commodification of milk production.

We are all products of the societies in which we live, and the role of the mother differs in each. Even so, because Freud was plumbing theories of the mind where none yet existed, he came to believe that his experiences of milk and motherhood were universal when, indeed, they were a product of his society.

In our modern era, the breast remains associated with milk along another dimension — a sexual one. Foundation web crawlers detect, passively, an incredibly high frequency of the phrase “mommy milkers” as one of desire. Indeed, milk is tied with both motherhood and fecundity.

The role of the mother in today&#39;s societies is under constant flux. In our post-Fordist capitalist society, the archetypes of the working mother, the high-powered business executive mother, and the sexually objectified mother of other people, have all become increasingly common, even as those who express desire towards such archetypical roles do so in modes of behavior that hearken back to their infancy. As the noöspheric links that connect milk, motherhood, and sexuality continue to shift, increasingly unpredictable containment challenges shall arise.

++* 1[[span]].3[[/span]] Ritualism (Extramundane)
++++* Spiritual Practices
----
It is a natural tendency for societies to sanctify ritual objects that become prominent in our daily lives. For most of humanity&#39;s state as an agrarian society, the cow or other livestock was central to the home, second only to the hearth. Thus, milk features prominently throughout world religions and cults.

[[div class=&#34;indented end-mark&#34;]]
In the Mediterranean, this manifests in many forms, including the Apis bull, the cult of Mithras, and the tale of Zeus suckling upon the teat of the goat Amalthea. In the Icelandic Prose Edda, the cow Auðumbla similarly sustained the progenitor giant Ymir. In the Puranas, the king Prithu milked the Earth-goddess Prithvi to end a famine plaguing humanity, and in the Samudra Manthana, Kshira Sagara — the Ocean of Milk — seals the elixir of immortality. Milk is the source and originator of the life of the world; the source from which all being flows.

Even without being the metaphorical wellspring of humanity, the source and presence of milk convey a sense of divinity:
* The sacred status of cows and other mammals in Hinduism, popularized in the West as the Sacred Cow.
* The Sacred Cows of Apollo.
* The repetition of the phrase &#34;Land of Milk and Honey&#34; in the Hebrew Bible as a description of the promised land.

For the entirety of human civilization, milk has been inherently, intrinsically, and inseparably tied to the concept of divinity and its manifestations upon the Earth. It is the drink that bridges both mundane and supernal realms.

[[div class=&#34;narration justified&#34;]]
++* 1[[span]].4[[/span]] Ritualism (Mundane)
++++* Domestic Practices
----
With the spread of western European culture across the world, the use of milk and milk-like substances has been integrated into the daily rituals of millions of individuals. Milk serves multiple purposes in the household: It is drunken in the mornings, as part of a balanced meal; it is drunken after physical exertion, to enhance muscular growth; and it is incorporated into a balanced diet overall.

[[div class=&#34;indented end-mark&#34;]]
Milk has been enshrined in the nutritional guidelines of government-backed health organizations, most infamously the USDA Food Pyramid, active from 1992–2005. The Food Pyramid placed milk in an elevated state, to be consumed more rarely than the base of fruit, vegetables, and grain, but more commonly than the luxuries of fat and sugar. In this way, milk occupied a liminal area, elevated from the succor of the common people but debased from traditional offerings to the gods.

It is fitting, in a sense, that the average American drinks milk or milk derivatives every morning, whether atop cereal or in coffee. Milk is a prominent part of the domestic ritual of breakfast. Globally, the use of milk as daily ritual and foodstuff has even influenced traditionally lactose-intolerant populations, as the popularity of the Taiwanese-originating “boba” — tapioca tea with milk — demonstrates. The population of Earth has incorporated milk into its daily routines of wakefulness.

Milk is also enshrined within certain body-focused subcultures as a readily available source of protein and nutrients. These individuals view milk as possessing a nigh-ambrosial quality, capable of supercharging their attempts at self-transformation. They will often partake in a ritual “chug” of milk, in which they consume as much of the substance as possible in a brief period, in the belief that doing so will enhance the transformation of their muscles.

Even individuals who cannot drink cow or goat&#39;s milk may use milk-substitutes, such as plant-based milks, in their daily rituals.

Milk pervades every aspect of modern human civilization. Fittingly, it commonly appears in anomalies intertwined with or arising from the otherwise mundane passage of human life. Although its presence may appear purely incidental at first, Project GALAXIAS monitors any anomalies that place an undue importance on milk in a mundane context, should additional containment challenges become necessary.

[[# CHE]]

[[div class=&#34;narration justified&#34;]]
++* 2[[span]].1[[/span]] Cheese
++++* Milk Byproduct
----
Human beings have been processing milk into hundreds of byproducts since the dawn of civilization. Human societies have produced an incredibly diverse assortment of cheeses. Other milk derivatives, such as cream and butter, and fermented products such as kefir, have also served as the backbones of their respective societies. Modern industrial technology has also allowed for the creation of further-abstracted milk derivatives. It is helpful to understand the role of these byproducts and their relationship with milk itself for the purposes of containment.

[[div class=&#34;indented end-mark&#34;]]
Cheese can be understood, at base, as solidified milk proteins curdled and separated from milk liquids. These milk proteins are then treated in a nigh-uncountable number of ways to impart flavor, transform texture, and preserve the food. These transformations are carried out by bacteria, enzymes, and the passage of time. However, this scientific description of cheese-mongering does not capture the importance cheese holds in human societies. Cheeses often become associated with their place of manufacture, which becomes embedded in their identity memeplexes. The most notable instance of this association is Parmesan cheese and Parma, Italy.

Other milk derivatives are considered more for their culinary purposes than as dishes in their own rights. While butter is associated with multiple styles of cuisine, such as American Southern and French cooking, it is known in those cuisines for the sense of luxury it imparts, stemming from the milkfat, but often attributed to the fat itself. This level of processing has abstracted the substance away from the milk memeplex. A similar train of logic can be applied to industrial milk derivatives such as whey protein or coffee creamer. These substances may originate from milk and may carry some of the properties of milk — imbuing strength or imparting luxury — but they are not thought of as milk.

Of all milk derivatives, only cheese is a close enough conceptual neighbor to milk such that containment best practices may be transferable between them. For this reason, Project GALAXIAS keeps a tally of cheese-related anomalies, as there may be a need for increased vigilance as the future draws ever nearer. Future developments in cheese-making may one day create a cheese that is no longer considered a milk derivative, but such a development, should it ever come, is far, far, far into the future.

++* 2[[span]].2[[/span]] Clowns
++++* //Homo sapiens prodigiosus//
----
We have no idea what clown milk is.

[[div class=&#34;indented end-mark&#34;]]
Consult the earliest Foundation records on the subject and you will find that clown milk has powerful mutagenic and hallucinogenic properties. It is biologically pluripotent — its effects on human beings are unpredictable.

There are indications that it is, effectively, a contagion. When imbibed in sufficient quantities, clown milk can transform human beings into clowns — themselves capable of producing clown milk. This would not usually be a concern on its own, except clowns are apex predators for humanity. Clowns are capable of luring humans, both children and adults, with flashy displays of mystical trickery. [[[herman-fuller-hub|Herman Fuller&#39;s Circus of the Disquieting]]] is purported to convert harvested clown milk into cotton candy and other sweets to ensure a steady supply of reliable transformations.

The speciation of clowns is likewise unclear. There are undeniably sapient clowns — who are rumored to run the modern Circus of the Disquieting — but a substantial body of sub-Veil clown enthusiast literature is based upon treating clowns as nonsapient beings, filling the same niche as show poodles and other such pets. It is unclear whether nonsapient clowns can become sapient, or vice versa. It is unclear whether clown milk plays any role in the creation of nonsapient clowns. It is unclear whether clown milk sold for consumption is harvested from sapient or nonsapient clowns. It is unclear whether clown milk harvested from sapient clowns will always transform human beings into sapient clowns.

Clown milk is black and abnormally sweet. It otherwise has the texture of regular milk, and can be considered a one-to-one substitute in most culinary applications.

Although its properties are fairly similar to regular milk, it is distant enough from the core lactic memeplex that clown milk anomalies are not expected to fall under the purview of Project GALAXIAS.

**Description:** SCP-5665 is an anomalous variant of dairy cow capable of producing massive amounts of methane within their digestive system through unknown sources. Additionally, they can expel this gas through their anuses and ignite it, presumably using an unidentified flame-producing organ located within the lower digestive system. SCP-5665 instances are able to move in the same manner as a non-anomalous cow; however, they have been observed to instead favour propelling themselves via combustion of their anomalous flatulence. Despite the high temperatures and pressures SCP-5665 are subjected to, they appear to be unaffected physically by this method of transportation.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]As displayed in Addendum 5665.001, SCP-5665 instances are also immune to the effects of air resistance, including the rise in temperatures.[[/span]]

Analysis of tissue gathered from deceased instances reveals that female instances are capable of producing non-anomalous milk.

&gt; When a person suffering from dehydration or starvation comes into contact with SCP-7148, they are given a supply of goat&#39;s milk stored in a leather pouch together with a tiny seed-shaped white substance wrapped in leather and sinew (hereby referred to as SCP-7148-FH and -FM).

= [[[SCP-7314]]] — Horn of Plenty
&gt; * DAIRY - [# SCP-6542] is connected to CORNUCOPIA by a pipeline that runs through a permanent Way at GLOBE&#39;s edge. Milk is continually pumped out of the anomaly and into CORNUCOPIA through this pipe. Sensors on the Marzek side of the Way are programmed to detect any RAPTURE events produced by SCP-6542 and automatically close the Way to prevent SCP-7314 from flooding.

&gt; ██/██/82: SCP-7459-C is transferred to Area-12 and placed in an incubation chamber. SCP-7459-C refuses to consume any synthetic milk given to it, subsequent attempts are made utilizing preserved milk from its deceased mother, although SCP-7459-C seemed more interested, it still refused to consume it. Forced feeding was authorized for a period of 4 weeks.

||~ Date ||~ Theological Entity Involved ||~ Events ||
|| **29/11/2011** || [# SCP-6542] || A column of milk erupts from SCP-6542 despite the absence of cheese that normally indicates a RAPTURE event, leaving behind an otherwise empty mundane marble vat. The column penetrates the ceiling of the Marzec Church, where it is observed travelling at supersonic speeds towards the North Pole without significant mass loss. Visual contact lost due to poor weather conditions over the North Sea. ||
|| **29/11/2011** || [# SCP-5998] || Milk column is sighted by personnel at Outpost-5998 in the North Pole. It coalesces into a humanoid form before slowly approaching SCP-5998. It places an arm onto the right shoulder of SCP-5998. All Type-I Empyrean entities manifesting during this incident appear to cower before the humanoid mass of milk. Personnel report hearing a faint exchange of words before SCP-5998 lifts its head. All entities promptly vanish after 12 seconds. SCP-5998 and SCP-6542 have been redesignated as Neutralized. ||

&gt; According to SCP-CN-2405&#39;s parents, SCP-CN-2405 refused normal breast milk and baby food, and was able to maintain normal growth subsisting only on Coca-Cola and fried chicken. This continued until SCP-CN-2405 developed permanent teeth, after which SCP-CN-2405 was able to chew foods and consume a normal human diet; however, it continued to prefer Coca-Cola and fried chicken.

||||**Modified file:** &lt;&lt; fruits\main.fall &gt;&gt; Increased nutritional value. ||
|||| The plant produced several instances of SCP-ES-041-2 ten times larger than the original. When ingested, the exposed subjects presented a rapid increase in the level of sugar, vitamins, cholesterol and proteins in the blood, leading them to hepatorenal failure with deterioration of the arterial irrigation of the brain and myocardium. In spite of this, the oxygenation in the blood was sufficient to maintain breathing. At one point, the aforementioned levels stopped rising, maintaining a stable point (which would otherwise have started the process of putrefaction). The blood of the subject was transmuted, becoming a whitish gel with a composition similar to human milk but much denser. The subject suffered a notable cognitive deterioration and, despite remaining conscious, is unable to communicate.||

&gt; Tests concluded that the drinking chocolate adapts to the respective subject&#39;s preferences. Variations included some without sugar, sweetened with honey, with dark or white chocolate, with cinnamon, Christmas seasoning, chili, with apple aroma, Pumpkin Spice, with marshmallows or with cream and sugar sprinkles. For subjects unable to consume regular drinking chocolate,[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]For example, during strict vegan diets or lactose intolerance.[[/span]] the milk got replaced by a vegan alternative, like almond or oat milk. For subjects not favoring chocolate or are unable to tolerate it, hot spiced milk appears as an alternative.

**Result:** The flavor was described as identical to milk tea. Consuming the potion showed no noticeable effects on subjects. [DATA EXPUNGED] the subjects or [INSUFFICIENT CLEARANCE] did not produce the expected results. Adjusting sweetness level, ice levels, or choices of additives led to the same result.

Although some lactic phenomena have proven mundane after more rigorous analysis, this is not for lack of trying. The elusive nature of dairy can still provide deep insights into the nature of human experience and the secrets of the Cosmos.

&gt; //The youngest of them brought a cow from the pasture, heavy with calf and ready to birth in few nights. The warriors briskly surrounded her, and grabbed her horns and legs; and the woman, who followed them in their march, made her eyes straight with the eyes of the beast, and whispered something to her in her alien tongue. When the cow had calmed down, Anakara, who had a beard of grey and hair crowned with hawk feathers, stood up from the bonfire, took his hammer in both of his hands, and struck her hard in the abdomen. The horned one roared, and dropped her child, but restrained she could do naught. Anakara then snatched the dagger from his right scabbard, took off the baby&#39;s caul, and carefully inserted the blade into their abdomen, cutting the convulsive frail body from top to bottom. After removing the bowels, Anakara unfolded them to their full length and cut guts into short ribbons, which he then wrapped around the arms of as many men as there were ribbons and placed them in the front row. The calf was then burned, and their mother was blinded for the eyes to give to the woman who aided them in their work.//

Not every encounter with the Anomalactic has been so straightforward. Select SCP Items have well exceeded hazardous levels on both the Naismith Farcicality Scale and Holt–Panagiotopolous Sass Threshold, and have been sequestered from the Foundation at large. These items exist solely under the purview of the [[[you|Department of Other]]]. As such, we have not been able to assess these documents for connection to the seven lactic taxonomies.

Although communication between the Departments of Other and Lactic Anomalies has remained limited, the Department of Other has agreed to share a set of documents relevant to our purposes. These are as follows.
