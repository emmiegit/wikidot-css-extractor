SCP-7000 is a six-sided die that occasionally lands on a seven. It is 1.8cm wide, white with blue dots except for in the &#34;one&#34; and &#34;seven&#34; faces which are red, and plastic in make as pictured in this file. The &#34;five&#34; face has a chip on one of the dots, as illustrated by Dr. Morgan. Item is highly tychekinetic; as in, it manipulates probability, or &#34;luck&#34;.

&gt; Extraction is to be done under Zero Collateral protocol as per the gracious approval from the Mayor of Storith, but at my command you are allowed to singularly eliminate the holder of the item, who is Mark Kiryu. He currently resides in the entertainment district of Storith, and frequents Crown Casino. He does not always bring the die; extortion methods permitted if found without the item. You will be provided my prototype tachykinetic suit, courtesy of Dr. McCallum&#39;s final project and sacrifice.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Do be entertaining, as the die values that most, it seems... though it&#39;s an untested theory. I must say, Dr. McCallum&#39;s handwriting is so easy to read. If you want, when the mission&#39;s over, I&#39;ll give you the very notebook where this hypothesis was written; see what you think of it.


&gt; The plan is simple, Dr. Coin. You have the data, you know the patterns, for you are the bard and I am your dancer. Mark Kiryu has been guaranteed an appearance in the casino; barricade the exits with at most three agents and have an SRA lined vessel for SCP-7000 at the ready, and everything else is my patron&#39;s unflinching plan. I assure you this whole process will be quiet and you will touch this die again come overmorrow.

&gt; Done and readied. Pictures of me and the agents supplied in envelope.
&gt; 
&gt; Writing this note like his character&#39;s letter... it&#39;s a nice gesture. Thank you. If I may reply:
&gt; Come overmorrow I will take you up on this promise, not out of distrust but out of anticipation. My flock will follow your wingbeat as you will follow my birdsong. The plan is simple and the box is about a ringholder&#39;s size, and is lined with only the finest of coalesced unreality. We have a getaway vehicle, and if fortune has you out of her paperwork-vow binds, you shall carpool in our carriage, the black honda civic parked to the east exit of the casino.

&gt; //The following is the transcript of the feeds from a hidden camera in Agent Shard&#39;s glasses, a body cam on his person, and cellphone audio recording from the SCP-7000 extraction mission. It should be noted that Agent Shard&#39;s civilian identity and personnel identity have been protected via antimemetic shielding as a precautionary measure against any recognition as is the standard for Special Deployment agents. A copy of this transcript and the recordings preceding it has been forwarded to O5-2 &#34;Bureaucracy&#34;, The Mayor of Storith, and O5-5 &#34;Blackbird&#34;.//
&gt; 
&gt; On December 21, 2021, Agent Shard accompanied Dr. Coin&#39;s SCP-7000 extraction team to Crown Casino. At Agent Shard&#39;s express direction, the downsized team dispersed on the ground floor until the cue to move to the exit once item is retrieved. Agent Shard moves to look for Mark Kiryu on the second floor.
&gt; 
&gt; Upon a few minutes of walking, Agent Shard comes across a visible crowd around the bar due to the bartender making an elaborate drink using more than two hands (physical anomaly), and Mark Kiryu is spotted at the edges of the gathering, alone at a table. Agent Shard takes the seat across him. Conversation is started.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mark Kiryu:** And you are...?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Shard:** Not lonely anymore. Provided you don&#39;t shoo me away, that is.
&gt; 
&gt; //A pause passes as Mark Kiryu resumes drinking. Agent Shard waves a waiter over.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Mark Kiryu:** You should know that I&#39;m taken.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Shard:** Charmed to meet you too. Everyone knows you here, but nobody gets close enough to get to know the new boss of this place... do forgive me for taking this chance to be your friend. Ah- yes, just champagne, please- thank you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mark Kiryu:** Celebrating something?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Shard:** Fortune&#39;s hand has caressed me this night, I&#39;ll say. ...on that note, what do you play?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mark Kiryu:** Oh, the usual. Craps, Sic Bo, Klondike... I&#39;ve never dabbled outside what I know, you see. Much of my time is spent looking at the checks and balances, very precise and objective work. I do despise ambiguity, so...
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Shard:** I see.
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Shard&#39;s drink arrives, and he tips generously.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Shard:** If you must know I&#39;m not seeking an arrangement. I have enough money for the foreseeable future. Although I&#39;m still trying to parse you in order to speak of what I //do// want from you correctly.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mark Kiryu:** Then we&#39;ll play. You bet your winnings and I bet my... whatever that could be.
&gt; 
&gt; //Mark Kiryu tells a waiter to fetch spare dice, in Japanese. Table starts shaking and unfolding. Mark Kiryu taps an app on his cellphone that changes the table&#39;s face into a Sic Bo playing mat. It&#39;s here where a small crowd starts noticing Mark Kiryu about to play, and begins watching.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Mark Kiryu:** Table expands, sorry, forgot to say- move back a bit- I&#39;m sure you&#39;re familiar with &#34;the house always wins&#34;, so surely you don&#39;t mind me playing what I know well.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Shard:** I do think I have a little winning hubris. My luck doesn&#39;t feel dried up. You might end tonight with but only your name on your lips.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mark Kiryu:** //(laughs)// We&#39;ll see. Game is standard rules Sic Bo; game of guessing the faces of three dice or the sum of its numbers. We each get a turn in rolling the dice, I roll for your guesses, you roll for mine.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Shard:** Not much for complicated rules, are we?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mark Kiryu:** Life is already complicated, why add to it?
&gt; 
&gt; //Waiter arrives with dice, and leaves. Mark Kiryu picks up the dice and rolls it between his hands, gesturing for Agent Shard to make the first move.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Shard:** Since the bets aren&#39;t for money... I&#39;ll go out on a limb and guess you&#39;ll roll a five and a six. I think you&#39;ll roll high.
&gt; 
&gt; //The dice are rolled, and it rolls a one, five, and six.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Mark Kiryu:** You get two questions.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Shard:** You&#39;re part of the Kiryu family. One that owns Kiryu Labs, with ties to The Foundation. With all the drama surrounding you... how do you feel? And what&#39;s that you&#39;re drinking?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mark Kiryu:** I... hmm. Let me talk about that while you roll. Here, I&#39;ll show you how-
&gt; 
&gt; //Mark Kiryu places the dice in Agent Shard&#39;s hands and closes them over the dice, and his own hands and fingers trail on Agent Shard&#39;s knuckles. Agent Shard has stated at the end of the mission that this was the initial tip-off that Mark Kiryu knew about the extraction; as he is unidentifiable visually when taking up his agent identity, his callouses are a dead giveaway.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Mark Kiryu:** You move your hands like this and the dice will spin very fast on the table. Randomness feels more assured that way... even though all odds stay the same. I feel like there&#39;s little to nothing people can do in the face of fate and destiny, but fate and destiny are just numbers against the complexities of living life. To that end, I&#39;ve cast away any real feeling of external responsibility and decided that if opportunities present themselves... I simply must take them.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Shard:** Thank you. What&#39;s your guess?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mark Kiryu:** Let&#39;s see a sum of thirteen.
&gt; 
&gt; //The dice rolls two fives and a three. One of them has the signature nick on the five face.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Shard:** //(laughs)// On the money! I guess there&#39;s luck in making it big as a casino owner, huh. Alright... you get a question and a favour I can do sitting down.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mark Kiryu:** Acceptable. Do you believe in unlucky numbers? Superstitions I grew up with state four as the number of death, and later I learned thirteen had a terrifying stigma around it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Shard:** I believe in luck as much as you do. It&#39;s certainly comforting knowing assured survival as long as you take every chance you get, and that it&#39;s important to &#34;put a bet in every pot&#34;, as it were. You bet thirteen and thirteen benefitted you for this round, so it is no longer unlucky in this game. Likewise the lucky number seven in a slot machine when it doesn&#39;t match the other rolls would be simply unfortunate.
&gt; 
&gt; Your favour?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mark Kiryu:** Incidentally, it ties into your other question. This cocktail I&#39;ve been sipping has a //dreadful// bitter aftertaste to it... so take a sip. &#34;I dare you&#34;, so to say.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Shard:** You&#39;re lucky that I&#39;m //very// daring.
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Shard sips the cocktail and could parse that it contained a mixture of unlicensed amnestics and crushed raw kidney beans, which are toxins that Agent Shard has done resistance training towards. The taste is masked by a peanut-flavoured alcohol. Mark Kiryu&#39;s expression indicated anticipation, and Agent Shard finished the drink in response.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Shard:** ...hmm. I thought I would make you a little bit angry with finishing that in front of you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mark Kiryu:** Incidentally, I own this casino, and can order another one whenever I want. Make your next guess.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Shard:** Touché. Did you know that there&#39;s dice superstition in mixing a lucky die with other less lucky dice? Dungeons and Dragons superstition... as for my prediction, one of them will roll a seven, Mark.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mark Kiryu:** The board doesn&#39;t account for that. The die isn&#39;t even here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Shard:** Then there&#39;s no risk in rolling it because I&#39;ll lose if you&#39;re not lying, darling. I&#39;ll do you one better! It will roll the maximum value. It will roll six, six, and seven, for a total of //nineteen//.
&gt; 
&gt; //The crowd murmurs get louder and there is some cheering. Mark Kiryu casts the dice. It rolls the maximum value: six, six, and seven.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Mark Kiryu:** //Shard.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Shard:** Oh, that&#39;s my petname. Your sister sends her regards, //Maakun//.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mark Kiryu:** ...fine. One last bet. You win, and you take the dice- I don&#39;t need it now that I have what I want though this is useful... but if I win I still keep it and call the police. Acceptable bet?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Shard:** Of course it is.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mark Kiryu:** I am going to cast this die into the air. You will keep your palm open and your eyes closed. Knowing Dr. McCallum&#39;s possession and mine both started the same way, I&#39;d like to see who this die wants to come home with.
&gt; 
&gt; //The die is tossed into the air. It hits the chandelier, then a decorative pot, and seemed to be headed further from the table but then ricocheted off a pool ball that was hit too hard by a player, landing onto Agent Shard&#39;s hand. Agent Shard inspects it and verifies that it is the correct one by visual and rolling it on the table. It again results in a seven.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Shard:** Thank you for your business. And the three agents you&#39;ve sent to jump me at the entrance after I&#39;ve been sick and weakened have been subdued by my own team of three. Hell of a coincidence, isn&#39;t it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mark Kiryu:** Fuck you. Get out of here.
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Shard leaves the casino with Dr. Coin and her team. Feed ends as cameras are removed from his body.//

The SCP-7000 extraction mission has been completed under Zero Collateral protocol.

Although no legal charges can be pressed nor arrests be made against Mark Kiryu, there has been no significant news that would indicate him making an attempt at breaching any more objects from containment.

SCP-7000 has now been purchase-processed under Foundation checks and balances as per O5-5 &#34;Blackbird&#34;&#39;s directions. With Dr. Coin as the acting representative, its containment was granted to the McCallum residence two days after the extraction, broadcast live with massive press to commemorate the event not only as a PR move but to deter any other attempts to displace SCP-7000. The item was then privately bound in a contract where it could be used for research purposes by Foundation personnel at any point, effectively containing it.

The following is a stickynote extracted from Dr. McCallum&#39;s notes, placed on this document at the request of O5-5 &#34;Blackbird&#34;.

&gt; ...and I swear it really does like good, interesting characters. You could very well say //it favours the bold.//
