**Item #:** SCP-006-CU-EX
&gt;    
**Object Class:** Lifetime Companion
&gt;   
**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-006-CU-EX[[footnote]] Except for the ones with spiky parts. Those guy are meanies.[[/footnote]] are to be recovered by Mobile Task Force Phi-24 (&#34;Exoskeleton Enthusiasts&#34;) and carefully brought to any Foundation site so they can be loved properly. It is imperative to Foundation operations to have a high SCP-006-CU-EX count in all dormitories, showers,[[footnote]] Grated drains mind you. We CANNOT, I repeat CANNOT be washing our most valuable asset down the drain.[[/footnote]] cafeterias, gyms, and break rooms. We must have a chicken for every pot and a fly for every soup.

&gt;   
Anyone caught attempting to brutally murder an instance of SCP-006-CU-EX like a cold-blooded son-of-a-bitch is subject to immediate termination.
&gt;   

[[include component:image-block name=CU-EX3.jpg|caption=These things are fucking awesome!]]

**Description:** SCP-006-CU-EX is the collective designation for a group of completely resplendent insectoids colloquially referred to as bugs[[footnote]] EXCEPT FOR THE SPIKY ones. We do not talk about those around here. [[/footnote]]. They all are so sweet and have soooo many wonderful textures. Between the contained instances of SCP-006-CU-EX we&#39;ve found all of the beautiful colors of the double rainbow on their exoskeletons.
&gt;   
The feeling I get when an instance of SCP-006-CU-EX crawls on my skin makes me so giddy and bubbly that it has to be anomalous. All I want to do is hug them and hug them and never ever let them go.

&gt;     
**Addendum 006-CU-EX-01:** 
&gt; As of ██/██/██ it has been determined that Assistant Entomologist Johnson has been affected by a memetic hazard and is scheduled for immediate termination. SCP-006-CU-EX has now been classified as explained. -O5-1

**Addendum 006-CU-EX-02:**
&gt; I think he just //really// //really// likes bugs. It&#39;s probably not memetic, Obro-1. -Head Entomologist Patrick

**Addendum 006-CU-EX-03:**
&gt; Head Entomologist Patrick has been slated for immediate termination because he has clearly been affected by a memetic hazard also. No more bugs. [[[SCP-006-J|We are once again at peace with nature.]]]</textarea></pre>
