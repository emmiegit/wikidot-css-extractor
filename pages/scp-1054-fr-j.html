**Item #:** SCP-1054---FR---J

&gt; //Though this file was initially to be delegated to one of our secondary branches, the Administration has decided that, on one of my suggestion, its content was too sensitive to risk being distorted by a translation which did not capture all the subtle nuances of its original language. This will also prevent it from being given a European-style &#34;Threat Level&#34;, which is about as futile as its colour code is in bad taste. As a result, I am pleased to inform you that this SCP will remain in good hands: mine.// - Junior Researcher Cletus

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- --Keter-- --Euclid-- --Keter-- Euclid

&gt; //Considering its still poorly understood and potentially dangerous nature, I recommend that SCP-1054-J be classified as Keter in order to benefit from the appropriate containment procedures.// - Junior Researcher Cletus

&gt; //The Evaluation Committee has decided the object will be classified as Euclid and to be considered as such. It has undergone the same evaluation procedures as the previous 4000, and you do not have the power to decide for yourself, even if you are peeing yourself about its nature. Best regards.// - Dr. Vince

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to its nature, SCP-1054-J is not containable. In order to conceal its effects from the civilian population, the B135 coverage story &#34;Fake News&#34; was deployed, and a major --misinformation-- --reinformation-- misinformation operation was transmitted to all the Foundation&#39;s undercover agents in the world&#39;s main scientific organizations, as well as in influential media outlets and on social networks --(Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr included)--

&gt; //I don&#39;t see the point in specifying the names of the social networks concerned. The personnel likely to read this report know what a social network is.// - Dr. Vince

&gt; //Yes, and the same personnel are present on these networks. They are therefore directly concerned by these measures and it is legitimate to keep them informed. And then it allows them to better identify themselves.// - Junior Researcher Cletus

&gt; //Identify with what?// A large reinformation operation was transmitted on social networks, //that&#39;s enough. These are containment procedures. We are an international paramilitary research organization, we are not here to meet subscribers or to say that we like the same things as the reader, for fuck&#39;s sake! The SCP Foundation, unlike you, __Junior__ Researcher Cletus, does not need your constant reform attempts to exist.// - Dr. Vince

&gt; //Come on, come on. Here you go again with your &#39;wise&#39; words. We both know that if you overreact in this way it is because of negative personal assumptions on your part against some of these networks, and some of the personnel who use them. And because you can&#39;t stand that Supervisor Hammond has transitioned to female and posts about it regularly on Twitter and Tumblr. It&#39;s been a while, Vince. Don&#39;t think that your constant micro-aggressions go unnoticed.// - Junior Researcher Cletus

&gt; //But it&#39;s you who put Twitter and Tumblr in an official report and it&#39;s me who lacks objectivity?! That is quite ludicrous! What the fuck do you want me to care about Hammond, he does what he wants, if he could at least behave in a professional way and not const-//

&gt; //You see, you&#39;re misgendering her. The Foundation is preparing the world for tomorrow, Mr. Vince. If you are not able to get closer to people, to all people, to civilians, if you are not able to think about a more equitable future, I think it is time for you to give way to the new guard.// - Junior Researcher Cletus

&gt; //New guard? You are aware that just your extracts from online chats and SMS discussions that you put everywhere, transcribed as they are in a scientific file, represent a huge risk of misunderstandings which... oh fuck it, fuck you, fuck you all, you are incapable of living in a world that is not covered in sequins, all right, fuck you, it&#39;s been too long that this has been going on. We are not going to let the sacred fire extinguish, we are going to create a new organization, faithful to its values, and not directed straight into the wall by a bunch of tra//

Any media offensive by RPD Command must be stopped.

Since we lack scientific personnel due to the recent stupid and unjustified departures of  many members of staff, we have opted for a new formatting until such time when we can resume research. The images are now displayed in a larger format, and small coloured arrows guide the reader to beautiful inserts where relevant information will certainly be added in the near future.
[[/div]]

&gt; //Senior Researcher Cletus, I would like to see you in my office to discuss recent events and your attitude towards the newly formed RPD Command. All this seems to me to be quite counterproductive and, if it is not possible to recover our agents who left there, it could be interesting to see what lessons can be learned from this split, so that it does not happen again.// - Dr. Nassier

&gt; //I&#39;ve got better things to do than to go over this again, Nassier. The weed has been pulled. It left on its own. We made sure it left on its own. We&#39;re much better off without them.// - Senior Researcher Cletus

&gt; //Probably, but maybe not everything is to be thrown in this experiment. No one is objective, especially not you - and neither am I, be careful, that&#39;s not what I&#39;m saying - but this victim complex combined with your offensive attitude doesn&#39;t seem very... healthy, professionally.// - Dr. Nassier

&gt; //You&#39;re on their side, aren&#39;t you? I have informed the Site Director. Either you are with us or you are against us. Do you want to play the snooty like our international sites that refuse to integrate our symbols of peace? I&#39;ll cut off your food too then. I suffered a lot of pain building a climate of trust and acceptance, and I won&#39;t let you jeopardize everything I&#39;ve worked so hard on. If you&#39;re not happy, all you have to do is leave. We&#39;ll be much better off without you.// - Senior Researcher Cletus

**Artifact #:** RPD-1054-J

**Type:** Gamma

**Rules of Priority Domination:** Due to its nature, RPD-1054-J is not containable. In order to conceal its effects from the civilian population, the Jeth-2 coverage story &#34;Turnaround&#34; was deployed, and a major misinformation operation was transmitted to all the Command&#39;s undercover agents in the world&#39;s main scientific organizations, as well as in influential media outlets and on social networks.

Since the Command has just been founded, this report will for the moment be entirely composed of information that we have valiantly carried away with us from the treacherous claws of the SCP Foundation, saved shortly before they were manipulated and rewritten with a consensual sauce.
[[/div]]

&gt; //Director Vince, I was wondering if you had a moment to discuss? It&#39;s about our current relationship with the SCP Foundation. It&#39;s a bit tense.// - Researcher Némès

&gt; //I thought I made it clear that we no longer had anything to do with them and that we were cutting off all communication. The case is closed on our side. These wretches never miss an opportunity to take a single sentence in or out of context to make us look like fashes. So, no, I don&#39;t have a moment. Get back to work, it&#39;s through quality that we will impose ourselves.// - Director Vince

&gt; //That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;d like to talk to you about. The Command does welcome some Foundation alumni whose... motivation goes beyond the legitimate misunderstandings we have with the Foundation and draws more on... stronger and more controversial opinions. Of course, the RPD Command is not in their image as some people claim, but if we want them to stop claiming it, we should act. The new, hem, flag displayed in the hall makes me a little uncomfortable, I must say.// - Researcher Némès

&gt; //Our Command is founded on an ideal, Némès. An ideal which wants that anyone can work with us, as long as their opinions do not affect their work. As long as he does a good job, not like the Foundation&#39;s biased studies and stupid theories, which are only promoted because the personnel who present them make them look good on camera. If you want to fire people because they give us bad press, maybe we should start with yourself.// - Director Vince

&gt; //Dr. Cletus, the administration told me to turn to you, since you are chairing more and more projects. That&#39;s it, I&#39;m a little concerned about some of the steps taken recently within the Foundation. Last week, we lost 15 men in a submarine due to an immersion problem. Provoked by you, I&#39;m afraid. I am absolutely not here to accuse you, of course not, and my colleagues take a rather negative view that I have reproaches against you, you are a very respected person, but I would have liked to talk in more detail with you about the way things are going. Since the first schism, our work seems to have some flaws that we... let repeat instead of, well, correcting them. Perhaps out of pride, since it was the same flaws that our, uh, current enemies were blaming us for.// - Dr. Santanis

&gt; //Well, Dr. Santanis, I don&#39;t have time to waste on your paranoia. We&#39;re thriving more than ever, okay? See: at 4:00 p. m. I have an appointment with [[[scp-4213|a telepath who uses his power to get free ice cream]]]. And at 6:00, I&#39;m taking care of [[[scp-3213|a guy who&#39;s being insulted by seals]]]! Our files have never been so numerous or so good. Look at the personnel appraisal ratings! It&#39;s our apotheosis!// - Dr. Cletus

&gt; //To be honest, some of us are wondering if... well, if the C-Class personnel still have all their subjectivity. I have nothing against having a little fun, but it&#39;s true that the recent topics of study and the methodology adopted are... particular choices.// - Dr. Santanis

&gt; //My poor friend, these people don&#39;t know what&#39;s good. Vote democracy, yes. These foolish opponents, such as those of RPD - or CCC - or ACD - are enemies of democracy as long as it does not conform to their taste. Do you realize that? They push us to block the votes and the right of members to express themselves by trying to tamper with our system: the further away they are, the better we are. They are terrorists.// - Dr. Cletus

&gt; //What I mean is that... well, funny things, nods, private jokes can be found everywhere, and in abundance. It&#39;s easy to produce. At its beginning, our organization stood out because it proposed to deal with serious and mysterious issues, by equally serious and mysterious ways, and it might be clumsy to lose that in the long run. If the majority wants something else, they may simply not belong here.// - Dr. Santanis

&gt; //That is exactly the kind of sectarian comment that I cannot suffer. You sound like those fascists who accuse us of raiding their warehouses when they are the first to do so. No, there is not much in our past that we can be proud of, no matter what those who were there before may say. It is our duty to rework it. To perfect it. And if anti-progressists such as you disagree, go ahead, join a competition that is dying because it does not know how to give people what they want. So take the initiative for a new life. We&#39;ll be much better off without you.// - Dr. Cletus

&gt; //Nassier, I would have liked to have a brief talk with you. It concerns our recent break-up with the Foundation. Again.// - Apprentice Brandy

&gt; //We already talked about this at last week&#39;s meeting, Brandy. A significant proportion of the Foundation&#39;s employees seem to follow the words of some senior officers as gospel. Popularity calls for popularity. I do not reject the editorial shift taken by this noble institution, far from it, but we have made the bet to try the experiment with, say, a different approach.// - Analyst Nassier

&gt; //The fact is that we are struggling to recruit. Those who leave the Foundation mainly join RPD or ACD, which is embarrassing, but the real big problem is that we can&#39;t even recruit from outside. We have no visibility. People only know about the SCP Foundation and, because of the SCP Foundation, they don&#39;t discover us.// - Apprentice Brandy

&gt; //Well, the SCP Foundation will always monopolize the field, that&#39;s the way it is. Whatever their work, they were there first, they took the place, and they will keep the bulk of the attention. Whatever they do. Good or bad. I&#39;m not happy about it any more than that, but we&#39;re a vine growing in the shadow of a baobab tree - the question is to give good wine. Do I make myself clear?// - Analyst Nassier

&gt; //I... suppose? Actually, with the staff - all six of us - we had a little chat. We did a very good job here, we are proud of it, and we think it&#39;s a shame not to have more visibility...// - Apprentice Brandy

&gt; //That&#39;s out of the question.// - Analyst Nassier

&gt; //But I haven&#39;t even made a request yet!// - Apprentice Brandy

&gt; //You want to go beg our former employers to take you back. After having claimed our independence in full force and shouted for it. Because pride in quality work is not enough for you, you want it to be displayed between two studies of sh... Sorry for this reaction. But rest assured that this would be a big step backwards.// - Analyst Nassier

&gt; //Nassier, we&#39;re proposing an alternative that no one else has asked for. Those who don&#39;t like what has become of SCP go to RPD, or focus on their old work. Either we go back there and raise the level in our own way, even if it means being hidden behind work of.... variable quality but extremely valued, or we make radical changes here to propose something radically different from what they do. We have no choice.// - Apprentice Brandy

&gt; //Brandy, no offense, but I have the impression that your brain is completely rotten from these supply and demand stories. I may be the one who is too idealistic, I don&#39;t know, but despite the small size of our company I feel that we are on the right track, and I don&#39;t want to change it for considerations like that. Of course, if you want to start a new branch which best aligns with your vision... well, who am I to stop you? And maybe later on, the time will come for a partnership.// - Analyst Nassier

&gt; //Well, these are the results of this quarter&#39;s work, sir. I&#39;m not going to falsify them. Since the creation of the RPD, we have completed 58 studies, 14 of which have been declassified, 6 canceled due to problems in the work environment, and 5 whose documents were taken on board by ACD deserters. That makes 33.// - Pr. Gerton

&gt; //But it&#39;s ridiculous compared to the Foundation&#39;s production! They are now processing almost 50 cases per month!// - Director Vince

&gt; //BUT HAVE YOU SEEN THE QUALITY OF OUR OWN?// - Director Vince

&gt; //Sir, with a few exceptions, we work according to the criteria and working methods of the Foundation&#39;s early days. We keep a serious, effective, serious tone, without submitting to the fragility of the readership. We are preserving the sacred fire, sir.// - Pr. Gerton

&gt; //Yes, sir. You stated: &#34;It is out of the question to provoke attacks of this kind. Over my dead body. Now I&#39;m going to look out that window for the next ten minutes, of course I couldn&#39;t see and therefore not intervene if any of you were to disobey me.&#34;// - Pr. Gerton

&gt; //We&#39;ll see that at the aperitif too, but I&#39;ve contacted several members of the international concurrence branches, many of whom are in the same vein as us before our departure, I think we can reach a not gross compromise to expand our activities and create several global poles, a good start to the Foundation and the Command.// - Brother Expansif

&gt; //But we don&#39;t even have a finished report ye-//

&gt; //You will be delighted to know that in addition to the usual computers and pens, we now have old typewriters, and even a lectern with ink and a nib. With a wide variety of environments where each of you can feel more comfortable writing, production will be greatly improved.// - Master Némès
