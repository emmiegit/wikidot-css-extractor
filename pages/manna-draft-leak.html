//Senecio rowleyanus// is the plant Mother Nature uses when she wants to look her most regal. Strings of green pearls swooshing gently as the wind passes through. Tristan stood beneath a particularly impressive specimen. It was almost like a tree cave, seclusion on the green.

A swift kick to the shin jolted Tristan back to the present. Spinning towards it, he looked up, down, and around but saw only gravel and racks of plants suffering from chronic over-watering to varying degrees. It was then that he heard the rustling on his shoulder.

A fervent high-pitched voice began chirping from around the shoulder blade. &#34;Jesus Christ, please, stop, just, please- hold still for just one second, for the love of life, the universe and- and everything!&#34;

Freezing in place, Tristan&#39;s eyes began scanning his surroundings. Green pearls and leaves, none of which looked particularly conversational. 

Another sudden poking, and a //thwap// as the speaking something hit the leaf of an elephant ear plant. Crouching down, Tristan gingerly turned the leaf over and looked at its underside. Clinging to it was a medium-sized orange grasshopper wearing a white lab coat and a matching miniature grasshopper photo ID badge. One of the grasshopper&#39;s appendages was holding a miniature black attach√© case.

&#34;You can call me Wendy, pal. I&#39;m glad you could make it.&#34; Perching herself atop the leaf, she began idly rubbing her jumping legs together.

Blinking, Tristan&#39;s palms began to sweat ever so slightly, and he began breathing manually. Reaching for a handshake left Tristan hanging for a few moments before he withdrew to an awkward salute. &#34;I can see that you weren&#39;t exaggerating your, uh, unusual stature?&#34;

Wendy&#39;s antennae tilted up and down three times. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. I hear it all the time. But, to business. I believe that you&#39;re the reporter with his finger in the Junior vs. Bread feud.&#34;

Glancing around to ensure a lack of eavesdroppers, Tristan leaned in close. &#34;Look, I don&#39;t like to speak ill of the people I&#39;m reporting on. But Junior is just a horrible person at every conceivable level. I can&#39;t imagine what structural problems exist in Manna to let such a remorseless... yeah, he&#39;s definitely psycho. Again, objective reporting and all but still he sucks... and that&#39;s how you feel too, right?&#34;

Staring back at his inquiring eyes was the emotionless visage of a grasshopper. After a beat, the antennae began bouncing again, this time uncontrollably. &#34;Ohh, boy did I make you sweat, kid. Gosh, sorry. That was fun. Anyways, here&#39;s all of Junior&#39;s unfinished business.&#34;

Reaching one of her appendages into her lab coat, Wendy produced a miniature five-and-a-quarter inch floppy disc.

Squatting and squinting, Tristan cocked his head to the side. &#34;Uh, no offense Wendy, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to fit in anything I&#39;ve got access to right now.&#34;

&#34;Oh, my bad. This is for someone else.&#34; Stowing it back beneath the folds of the coat, Wendy stuck two appendages to rummage for a moment, then two moments. Finally, a microSD card slightly smaller than the miniature floppy was flying in the air towards Tristan&#39;s hands.

It bounced off his palm, falling in the dirt. Dropping to his knees, Tristan began frantically searching in the black dirt for his illicit black plastic card.

Hopping down to ground level, Wendy immediately found the card. &#34;Jeez. This is important to you, right? Try to be more careful.&#34;

&#34;Sorry, sorry,&#34; Tristan mumbled, gingerly reaching his hand out towards her.

&#34;Wait. Before I hand this over, we had a deal.&#34;

Of course. Reaching into his pocket, Tristan pulled out a miniature but fully-functional violin. It was a piece from a stupidly expensive Christmas ornament set that had cost more than his engagement ring. &#34;Hey, doing quid-pro-quo like this is kind of an unethical thing to do, as a journalist, right?&#34;

Shrugging as best she could, Wendy pulled the instrument close, holding it beside her thorax. &#34;Hey, it&#39;s like Mark Zuckerberg once said: You can be unethical and still legal, that&#39;s the way I live my life.‚Äù Pulling a small ball of twine from her lab coat she began tying the prize to her back. &#34;This&#39;ll do. Call it a cello and someone&#39;s bound to pay me for it. Thanks a lot, pal.&#34;

&#34;Uh, yeah, sure, no problem. Hey, one more thing-&#34; Tristan coughed, there was a small spray of dirt, and she was gone.

After a moment of fumbling, his new micro-sized incriminating SD card was safely ensconced within his smartphone, well on its way with him to the newsroom.

Beneath the ocean, in unexplored depths, there is a tragedy unfolding.

Desperate underwater beings have been stranded after the demise of their home, and to them, it seems to them like there is no hope. The only beacon of light they can enjoy is the high-wattage underwater spotlight set up by Manna, alongside similar setups by groups such as Global Occult and SCP, which has brought the only illumination to their otherwise dismal and dreary lives as underwater refugees. 


//Folks, please really try to sell the deprivation they&#39;re feeling down there. We want donors to be thinking of their neediness. Remember, these are for donors already ready to loosen the purse strings. We&#39;re working in degrees here. It&#39;s not a numbers game, so don&#39;t hold back. I know what you&#39;re capable of.//

Jim Bread, currently a so-called candidate for City of 3 Portlands at-large Alderman, believes that Manna not &#34;doing enough to provide genuine support or benefit&#34; to those who Manna exists to salvage from despair. 

NOTE THE FACT that Mr. Bread has been invited multiple times to sit with or even chair the Manna Charity Independent Citizen&#39;s Tribunate, to attend even one of our facilities, or to take any kind of an official tour. This criminal candidate resorts to trespassing and leaning on the wording of privacy laws to launch a smear campaign.

Jim Bread is a braggadocios liar who is also so incompetent he leaves his camera lens on all the time when trying to take &#34;incriminating&#34; photos of Manna&#39;s Pacific refugee facilities. Why will Jim go on official Coalition and Foundation group tours for those groups&#39; refugee management facilities but not the ones sponsored by Manna? It&#39;s probably because they&#39;re all up to no good against us.

//Three Portlands// - Freshly minted leader of the 3Ports chapter of the Manna Charitable Foundation Mark Hanna Jr. abruptly resigned his post today, citing a need for the charity to move on from the scandal which has swirled around the embattled philanthropist ever since documents emerged showing him belittling donors and openly planning to embezzle money with unnamed co-conspirators.

When asked for explanation, Mr. Hanna, known by his political nickname &#39;Junior&#39;, has not yet given a definitive answer to any news outlet to explain or acknowledge his drafted documents.

The death of his predecessor as chapter Leader, Alphonse Marquis, died earlier this year after complications from diabetes.
