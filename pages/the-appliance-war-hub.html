We never saw it coming.

The idea of life outside our understanding is standard here at the Foundation. The impossible is our goal, and we work around the impossible. But nobody ever considered the idea that the appliances we use every day also contain that life. We think they do, at least; they can certainly talk a lot of shit.

This has been one of the bloodiest conflicts in recent times. Mostly because of those toilets, many innocent souls -- innocent to us, at least -- have been lost. For a time, it was contained to Site-37. Mostly because there wasn&#39;t that many anomalies to worry about. On average, an anomaly contained here isn&#39;t going to be the most notable, so the rest of the SCPF didn&#39;t really consider the threat serious; hell, I doubt many would have even known.

But those toilets sparked something new, and now it&#39;s everywhere. //They// are everywhere. It&#39;s a terrifying thought, really, that the luxury goods sitting in your house or facility might be spying on you, or planning to attack at any given moment, or just ready to explode.

These are not normal times we&#39;re living in, even for our standards. I understand it&#39;s going to take a little bit of adjusting to, but we need all hands on deck. There&#39;s a Sarkic Antichrist working within our walls, toilets attacking people everywhere, and I&#39;m not sure where the Site-37 toasters have gone.

I can&#39;t say I&#39;m glad to have you, seeing as the circumstances are so dire, but welcome to the team.

[[tab What is THE APPLIANCE WAR?]]

++ IMPORTANT! THE APPLIANCE WAR IS ##red|NOT## A CANON, AND CURRENTLY THERE ARE NO PLANS TO BECOME A CANON.

THE APPLIANCE WAR is a collaborative writing project - series is probably the best term - revolving around an ongoing conflict between the SCP Foundation and the appliances they use every day. Mainly located in Secure Facility Site-37, APPLIANCE WAR is composed of multiple storylines (labelled as different rooms) which focus on different appliances.

The idea of what counts as an &#34;appliance&#34; is stretched thin here.

**THE SCP FOUNDATION**
An undercover organization which works to contain the anomalous and protect humanity under a veil of normality. 2022 has not been an easy year, coming out of a global pandemic and containment breaches on the rise. They certainly weren’t prepared for an appliance uprising. Because most of THE APPLIANCE WAR takes place in Site-37 (a place lacking any real hardcore, old-law Foundation ideas), this isn’t a “malicious” Foundation. Just an imperfect one.

**New Whirled Order**
Toilets? Toilets. NWO is an army of an unknown (but presumably massive) amount of toilets, led by one “Khazi”. Their goals are revenge for mistreatment and potentially the destruction of human society — whatever it is, they’ll throw themselves into the fight just to make a point. Seem to be working with many other appliances to fight this war… but activity outside of the Americas has been sparse. Why is unknown.

[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=37NUMBERSVG.svg|caption=The Site-37 emblem.]]

Originally a safe containment facility, Site-37 was eventually converted into the headquarters of the Human Resources Department — thus, the containment facility for all of their HR problems. Alongside the diminishing of the department, however, came the diminishing of the facility.

Site-37 is underfunded. Site-37 is easily forgotten. Most people at Site-37 don’t choose to be there. Worst of all, Site-37 is a mess.

Approximately 80% of all staff employed in the facility are brought in through HR — be it at real reasons, or the department being at the will of a rogue Site Director elsewhere. It creates a diverse and multi-minded cast of characters; however, not one that is entirely coherent or respected.

This identity as a facility is integral to the APPLIANCE WAR as a series: it’s not just about the Foundation — a massive, global, and all-powerful containment machine — fighting appliances. It’s about the underdogs, losers and mix of strange ingredients fighting appliances.

Though, not every story HAS TO be set on Site-37. Stories from across the SCPF work! Its just recommended to at least be related, since it’s a central location in 7119, 7939 and 7639.

[[tab How to Write for This Shitshow?]]

I&#39;m so glad you clicked on this tab! Generally (and not exclusively), articles in The Appliance War tend to be a little silly -- not Joke articles, but a number of them are intended to be somewhat funny. However, beneath this silliness that is inherent to appliances walking around is &#34;darker&#34; material - quite a number of people die and there is an air of seriousness that often leaks into these funnier concepts as a result of their disastrous consequences. It&#39;s about striking a balance between goofy concepts and not-so-goofy stories.

The best way to start contributing to THE APPLIANCE WAR is by doing 3 things:

# Read all of the published articles! Even though the pieces I put together myself tend to lean on the sillier side, not everything does. [[*user IndustryStandard]]&#39;s stories of the light are often a lot more introspective and stray away from the sillier stories. Because of how open the series is to different ideas and appliances, there&#39;s plenty of room to breathe in terms of what you create. Just read the works so you know what already exists.
# Think about how you can stretch the idea of a basic &#34;appliance comes to life&#34; article. This can be through SCPs, tales, or anything you want to throw together. The idea of an appliance coming to life is funny, yes, but a large part of The Appliance War is putting life behind the appliances. For some, it&#39;s usually stories of revolution and fighting back, but does every appliance hate their existence? The series is also very loose in terms of what is considered an &#34;appliance&#34; -- it&#39;s decided basically on a case-by-case basis, which leads into the third thing:
# If you want to start writing something, feel free to message me ([[*user ThatGuyThatTime]])! I&#39;m generally pretty accepting of any ideas you&#39;ll throw at me but I like to stay in the loop when people are putting things together for this series -- plus, there&#39;s all the timeline and character nonsense that people usually want to know.

While the series is open to taking any ideas and using any appliance, there are some that already have a pretty concrete role in their own storylines of the APPLIANCE WAR -- this doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t use them, but if you do, you should consider how it fits with what&#39;s already been done.

# The **MICROWAVES**, **OVENS**, and **TOASTERS** are determinately within their own faith-based storyline in &#34;THE KITCHEN&#34; as the Children of Steel. Their stories are mostly surrounding how they interact with a fellow named Junior Researcher Nial -- as well as Church of the Broken God content in an unconventional way.
# The **TOILETS** and **BIDETS** are in their revolutionary storyline which started in SCP-7939, centered around a mysterious toilet named &#34;Khazi&#34; and his incredibly destructive coup against humanity, primarily the Foundation. It&#39;s not a religious fight for the toilets as much as it is a matter of being used for... the bathroom. They&#39;re the more dangerous of the primary groups at the moment.
# The **LIGHTS** have something semi-planned out in a series by [[*user IndustryStandard]], which would be best discussed talking with them about.

Otherwise, go buck wild! We’re excited to see what you come up with.

# The amount of time for which the Foundation has existed is ambiguous; however, there are a few notable time periods which are important. The 90s and early 2000s marked the rise of the HR Department and the beginning of better working conditions.
# The COVID-19 pandemic did occur, however the Foundation was able to mitigate effects among their staff.
# D-Class very rarely exist across the Foundation, if at all — it’s been like that since 1995.
# The only bidet within any actual Foundation facility was destroyed at Secure Facility 01.
# The exact location of Site-37 is unknown, but it is believed to be somewhere in Northern Ontario. Why the O5 Council is letting (or perhaps, forcing) 37 deal with this is unknown.

**GUIDING QUESTIONS TO KICKSTART YOUR WRITING**
# What&#39;s an appliance / tool / device which would be interesting if turned into an anomaly, and how can you twist that concept into something consequential?
# Is the appliance in your story coming to life? To what extent?
# Why are the appliances in your story doing what they&#39;re doing? If they&#39;re alive, what&#39;s the motivation? If they&#39;re not alive, why&#39;s this happening?
# Is this appliance coming to life a funny concept, a scary concept, or something in the middle?
# Will your appliance win or lose?
# How can you raise the stakes of the anomaly?
# How does this affect the Foundation, specifically the people of Site-37?
# Where is this anomaly taking place, and why is the location significant?
# Does this connect to the other appliances currently within the war (ie. the Children of Steel, Khazi, etc)?
# Consider the underfunded and HR focused Site-37 -- can you involve that in an appliance war article?
