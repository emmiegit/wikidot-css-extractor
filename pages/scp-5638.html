**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-5638-A are to be kept within Site-17. All SCP-5638-A instances are to remain in isolated containment chambers for at least 12 hours a day. Their diet is to consist of shrimp, fish, and barnacles. All SCP-5638-A instances are to be fed at least twice every twelve hours. Other instances of SCP-5638-A are not to be mentioned in the presence of a single instance. If an SCP-5638-A instance asks about the whereabouts of other instances, it is to be told that all other instances have been terminated and that the instance in question is the last of its kind.   
Marine patrol is to be enforced to prevent any unauthorized sea vessels from unintentionally detecting or entering SCP-5638-B. 

**Description:** SCP-5638-A is a collection of 70 semi aquatic humanoids. Despite possessing a humanoid stature (with arms, a torso, legs, etc.), these entities are more notably similar to a //Cancer Bellianus.//[[footnote]]More widely known as the toothed rock crab.[[/footnote]] Each instance of SCP-5638-A is encased in a hard carapace that protects their vital organs. Additionally, each SCP-5638-A instance&#39;s head possesses a saucer-like shape that retains the previously described carapace. Two dichoptic eyes are located on the top of each head, as well as two mandibles retained on the lower half. They also have the ability to speak English, Greek, and Romanian. 
All SCP-5638-A instances display an inherent form of hostility and agitation. If an SCP-5638-A instance comes into contact with another instance, this hostility will shift to physical violence. Another common behavior that all instances display is an obsessive fascination with stars and constellations. 
 SCP-5638-B is a large island from which SCP-5638-A was first discovered. SCP-5638-B is approximately 2700 km sq. and is is located at coordinates 37 °N, 20 °W within the Ionian Sea. SCP-5638-B is completely invisible to any sea vessel outside 50 meters of its perimeter. [[footnote]] Some vessels have reported to have seen SCP-5638-B outside of this perimeter. See Discovery Log for more details. [[/footnote]] During daytime, SCP-5638-B presents no immediate anomalous behavior. However, if a person were to enter SCP-5638-B during nighttime, no stars would be visible in the sky. 




**Addendum-5638-A: Incident Report**
During an annual supply of resources at Site-17, various cargo was destroyed due to an unexpected storm, including a portion of the resources required for SCP-5638-A. This caused a certain SCP-5638-A instance to shout loudly and lead a riot. The riot resulted in all of the SCP-5638-A instances to fight each other for the resources that had arrived. Despite being told that more supplies were being sent within a day, the SCP-5638-A instances refused to stop fighting. The resources that had made it to Site-17 had been destroyed due to the incident. An interview was then conducted with the SCP-5638-A instance that had been primarily responsible for the incident (see Interview Log-5638). 58 SCP-5638-A instances were critically injured, and 12 were terminated.

**Interview Log-5638** 


**Interviewed:** SCP-5638-A instance, whom had been instigating many of the events during Incident-5638. Subject will be henceforth known as SCP-5638-A

**Interviewer:**  Senior Researcher Dr. Howell

**Foreword:** Audio Log of an interview conducted by Dr. Howell with SCP-5638-1 shortly after the events of Incident-5638.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Dr. Howell:** Good evening 5638-A, I suppose you know why you&#39;re here?

**SCP-5638-A:** I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about.

**Dr. Howell:** I am referring to the events that occurred earlier today with your fellow subjects, Incident-5638.

//(Dr. Howell reads off a written description of Addendum-5638-A to SCP-5638-A.)//

**SCP-5638-A:** Oh... that. Well, what do you want me to say? Its not my fault it happened. In case you haven&#39;t noticed, my &#39;fellow subjects&#39; are crazy! They&#39;ll kill each other any chance they get!

**Dr. Howell:** Right... well that&#39;s what we assumed at first, but then there were various accounts from site personnel that you had yelled over and over, &#34;The end has finally come, you fuckers are starving tonight&#34;.

**SCP-5638-A:** A lot of people were yelling a lot of things, ok? Since when was it a crime to conform with the masses?

**Dr. Howell:** Yet, you were told specifically that more supplies were being shipped during that time. And you still felt the need to cause a panic?

**SCP-5638-A:** Hold on, I don&#39;t know why //I// am getting all the blame here! I only ripped one guy&#39;s arm off, people have done worse.

**Dr. Howell:** Please understand, we are not blaming you for the results of incident-5638, we just want to know why you did these things to prevent it from happening again.

//(SCP-5638-A can be heard muttering to itself.)//

**Dr. Howell:** If you have something to say, SCP-5638-A, please say it. Remember, if you cooperate we will let you use the telescope again. You do love watching the stars, don&#39;t you?

**SCP-5638-A:** Wow, I see. You&#39;re going to extort information out of me? That&#39;s pretty messed up.

**Dr. Howell:** What is &#39;messed up&#39; is the inappropriate behavior that occurred today. You know my terms, SCP-5638-A.

**SCP-5638-A:** Okay, fine. The truth is, I WAS trying to get people riled up, are you happy?

**Dr. Howell:** You are admitting to causing the panic? May I ask why?

**SCP-5638-A:** I mean, can you really blame me?

**Dr. Howell:** What do you mean?

**SCP-5638-A:** These people, these //things//, they have it out for me! If they&#39;re not happy, nobody can be happy. You men in white coats don&#39;t understand, we deserve this!

**Dr. Howell:** What do you mean by &#34;we?&#34;

//(SCP-5638-A pauses.)//

**SCP-5638-A:** I didn&#39;t mean- I meant THEY deserve-

**Dr. Howell:** -It appears you hold a large amount of spite towards your fellow subjects.

**SCP-5638-A:** It appears so.

**Dr. Howell:** Well, you will obviously face repercussions for your actions, 5638-A. We cannot keep having these issues. 

**SCP-5638-A:** Oh please, I&#39;ve heard that before. You&#39;re acting like an arrogant know-it-all. Stop acting like you don&#39;t agree with me. You haven&#39;t been with them for as long as I have. Sooner or later you&#39;ll realize that they&#39;re better off dead. 

**Dr. Howell:**  That isn&#39;t our goal here. We just want to protect you, and learn more about your behavior. Maybe we can even help you.

**SCP-5638-A:** Help us? Why? Do you even know what they did?

**Dr. Howell:** What they did...? I&#39;m sorry, what do you mean by that?

**SCP-5638-A:** ...

**Dr. Howell:** 5638-A?

**SCP-5638-A:** Fuck you, I don&#39;t wanna talk anymore. 

**Dr. Howell:** You don&#39;t have a say in the matter, 5638-A. 

//(SCP-5638-A folds its pincers and looks away from Dr. Howell.)//

**Dr. Howell:** Okay, fine. I don&#39;t think we will be getting anywhere else, so may I ask one more question?

//(SCP-5638-A shrugs.)//

**Dr. Howell:** Despite your apparent hatred of each other, there seems to be one specific behavior that you and your fellow subjects have in common. 

**SCP-5638-A:**  And what would that be?

**Dr. Howell:** Tell me, 5638-A. Why do you like looking at the stars?

**SCP-5638-A:** That&#39;s a bit of a loaded question. The best way to describe it is... the stars remind me of myself. 

**Dr. Howell:** Remind you of yourself? In what way?

**SCP-5638-A:** It&#39;s like a reflection.

**Dr. Howell:** I&#39;m afraid I still don&#39;t understand.

**SCP-5638-A:** The stars //are// me. Someone like you wouldn&#39;t understand.

**Dr. Howell:** Well, I appreciate the attempt. Thank you for your time 5638-A. 

**SCP-5638-A:** I don&#39;t like you.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** Due to the acts performed by SCP-5638-A, the subject was transferred from Site-17 to Site-19. Current containment procedures were updated to prevent any more incidents involving SCP-5638-A. 10 minutes after subject was contained, it was recorded muttering the following words, &#34;He sounded just like my boss.&#34;
[[/div]]

**Addendum-5638-B:** Following the events of Incident Report-5638, a proper behavioral analysis was proposed in order to better understand SCP-5638-A. Two SCP-5638-A instances were isolated in a locked containment chamber for approximately 20 minutes with limb restraints. The conversation between each instance (henceforth designated as Subject A and Subject B respectively), was recorded.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

//For the first ten minutes of the experiment, neither Subject A nor B spoke. Subject B appeared to be distraught in Subject A&#39;s presence, and was focused on attempting to free itself from its restraints. Subject A sat in silence for a majority of that time before speaking.//

 **Subject A:** Could you stop doing that, please? You&#39;re not getting out anytime soon and its starting to get annoying.

**Subject B:** Of course YOU want me to stop, wouldn&#39;t you? The minute I put my guard down you&#39;ll probably just chop my head off or eat my remains or something! 

**Subject A:** You have no idea what you&#39;re talking about. Why on earth would I want to do that?

**Subject B:** I don&#39;t know, but what I do know is that I&#39;m the only sane one around here. 

**Subject A:** I&#39;m not insane. I&#39;m perfectly capable of rational thought.

**Subject B:** Those are the exact words one would expect from someone NOT capable of rational thought!

**Subject A:** And those are the exact words of an idiot.

**Subject B:** This is unbelievable! They told me you were all dead!

**Subject A:** I&#39;m... sorry to disappoint?

**Subject B:** It doesn&#39;t matter, I&#39;ll be out of here real soon and then you&#39;ll be sorry you ever met me!

**Subject A:** You know, it seems like you want to kill me more than I want to kill you. Why? Why are you so set on me being some kind of enemy? 

**Subject B:** You know just as well as I do. You can feign your innocence on the men in those coats, but not on me.

**Subject A:** I didn&#39;t ask to be locked up like I&#39;m some prisoner. However, if we weren&#39;t, we&#39;d have killed each other by now. And people like you are the reason why.

**Subject B:** Don&#39;t blame me! You all deserve to die, I just know it.

**Subject A:** Why, though? Why do you think that?

**Subject B:** Why don&#39;t you take a guess? You were there! We all were there, and don&#39;t give me &#39;we&#39;re the same&#39; bullshit. Your reasons were probably WAY worse than mine.

**Subject A:** Are you talking about the riot? I stand by the notion that I was defending myself. One guy was coming at me with a disembodied limb-

**Subject B:** You know I’m not talking about the riot. 

//(Subject A sinks in its chair.)//

**Subject A:** ...I know what you’re talking about. But different reasons don&#39;t matter. It was the same outcome. We chose this. 

**Subject B:** Tell me your reason, then! Why did you bring them down there? Why did you give them to the others?

**Subject A:** I don&#39;t really know why. Maybe I was jealous?

**Subject B:** I&#39;m not here to be your therapist. Tell me who it was.

 **Subject A:** It was an old friend. We were on a boating trip together. Then we found the island. I gave him to you all, and then you tore him apart.

**Subject B:** That&#39;s right, you gave him to us. You lead him to his death, just say it.

**Subject A:** I didn&#39;t mean to. When I found that place, I didn&#39;t know what to expect. It just appeared, after all.

**Subject B:** But then what?

**Subject A:** You //know// what happens next.

**Subject B:** I want you to tell me.

**Subject A:** Fine. Then, something offered me a choice. 

**Subject B:** And of course you chose to kill your best friend. I knew it, you&#39;re sick.  

**Subject A:** The stars- I was told I would be fine! It told me that I would be guilt free! And what about you? Who did you choose to drag down?

**Subject B:** I didn&#39;t choose anything, I&#39;m not like you freaks. My mind was probably corrupted and those thoughts were planted into my head. 

**Subject A:** Do you //really// believe that? I guess your soul wasn&#39;t the only one that drowned. Your mind must&#39;ve been dragged with it.
 
**Subject B:** What do you mean by &#39;souls&#39;?

**Subject A:** Is that not what they were?

**Subject B:** I didn&#39;t know others had been down there. 

//(Subject A emits a low, groaning noise. It attempts to fold its pincers together and places them on its lap.)//

**Subject A:** We have all been there, down in the trench. I saw the shining bodies gently floating, and they looked exactly like what I had pictured souls to look like. They were all flailing their arms trying to reach for safety. Instead, they grabbed each other. And they went further and further down. 

**Subject B:** I know what it looked like. It was so...

**Subject A:** Comforting.

**Subject B:** Horrifying! 

**Subject A:** This is what we&#39;ve chosen. I&#39;ve come to terms with that.

//(Subject A gently taps it&#39;s pincer on the table.)//

**Subject B:** This is all wrong, so so wrong. 

**Subject A:** There&#39;s nothing that can be done. 

**Subject B:** I felt so pathetic... I still do. A piece of me is stuck down there, I need to make things right. I need to go back!

**Subject A:** At this, at least, we are in an agreement.

//(Subject B shifts uncomfortably in its seat.)//

**Subject B:** Same cause, different reasons. You want to go back to continue the senseless murder, don&#39;t you? I was right, you are a freak.

**Subject A:** I&#39;m not a freak, I&#39;m human.

**Subject B:** Shut up! You aren&#39;t a human, you never were. I swear, I&#39;m going to get out of here, and I&#39;ll fix this. I&#39;m going to leave it all behind. Then once I&#39;m better, Ill come back and put all of your asses out of your misery!
 
**Subject A:** Alright, I&#39;m done with this. You truly are ignorant to the reality of the situation. You can&#39;t &#39;get better&#39;. This is who you are now, no point in trying to gasp for air. 

**Subject B:** Then, I&#39;ll get a massive gun or something, and go back to that damned island. This place has got to have big guns, right? I&#39;m going to go back to the island and get my soul back. Maybe Ill get some closure along with it.

**Subject A:** Closure? You&#39;re kidding, right? You don&#39;t need closure, and you don&#39;t need your watered down soul either. Just stop talking, you sound like a moron.

**Subject B:** I&#39;ll find the place we saw and I&#39;ll see what&#39;s down there. Something is dragging us down there. Whatever it is, it&#39;s not letting go.

**Subject A:** You&#39;re not even listening to me. I&#39;m serious, stop talking-

**Subject B:** But I&#39;ll make it let go, I&#39;ll put a bullet through its-

//(Subject B was interrupted as Subject A tore itself free from its restraints and began to tear Subject B apart. After it did so, it said aloud: &#34;Why do the stars need to let go?&#34;)//


**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** Security personnel apprehended Subject A and was properly restrained, however Subject B could not be resuscitated. Subject A was sent back into its containment cell.

]]
**Discovery Log:** 
 SCP-5638-B was first discovered during an investigation looking for people who, at the time, were considered lost at sea. Over a span of 4 years, approximately 152 people were reported lost at sea and had not been found. 
Due to all the reports originating within the same area, The Department of External Affairs proposed an authorized search. MTF Gamma-6 (&#34;Deep Feeders&#34;) was sent for retrieval of all missing persons.
 After 2 years of searching, SCP-5638-B was discovered as of 5/16/2015. The crew responsible for discovering SCP-5638-B claimed to have seen it from 120 km away, which contradicted the 50 km invisibility perimeter. As per Dr. Sebastian&#39;s request, who was a researcher aboard the vessel, it will be stated that there was very low morale on the ship at the time. 
 Upon entering the island, no MTF units reported to have seen any anomalous activity. At 20 km inward of the island, the first of 64 human corpses were discovered. The remaining 63 corpses were littered at random points in SCP-5638-B, but increased in frequency further inward. Dental reports show that the remains of the corpses found match many of the missing people initially reported missing.
 34 km Northwest from deployment zone is a large, underwater trench. The trench was reported to be &#39;foot shaped&#39; and is approximately 150 km long and 57 km wide. Due to the high turbidity of the water, it was proven impossible to visualize the bottom of the trench. Attempts at using underwater cameras to see below the surface have been unsuccessful.
The first instances of SCP-5638-A were found shortly after the trench was discovered. The SCP-5638-A instances climbed out of the water and attempted to physically assault specific MTF members. The members that were attacked had all originated from the search vessel that had first discovered SCP-5638-B. The crew was forced to open fire upon the entities, which subdued them.
 50 meters away from the trench was a worn down Panasonic AG-DVX100P Camcorder. The camcorder is presumed to have belonged to PoI-5638-33, aka 25-year-old Silas Andreas. PoI-5638-33 was reported to be one of the 152 missing people. Upon reviewing the footage retained in the camcorder, two videos were discovered. The first video (VR-5638A) had been recorded one week before PoI-5638-33 and PoI-5638-34&#39;s disappearance and is 7 minutes long. The second video (VR-5638B) had been recorded two days after their reported disappearance, and is 54 seconds long. PoI-5638-34 was 25 year old Adam Tolis, whom had also been reported missing. 

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**VR-5638A**
 
//&lt;VR-5638A starts with a young man, presumed to be PoI-5638-34 Adam Tolis, sitting on a rock. He is wearing with what appeared to be a grey t-shirt and red swim trunks. A voice can be heard from behind the camera addressing him. The voice was confirmed to belong to PoI-5638-33. In the background, a small boat can be seen anchored a few meters offshore.&gt;//

**Silas:** Hang on- I almost got this thing set up.

//(The camera shakes as the video zooms in on Adam)//

**Silas:** There! I got it to zoom. Now I can see your bored expression!

**Adam:** Damn, do I really look bored? I thought my acting skills were getting better.

**Silas:** Come on, it&#39;s just one photo. I want to put this on my fridge so I can cherish this moment forever. 

**Adam:** Very funny, and I&#39;m sure after this we&#39;re going to go play some catch and have some good father and son bonding time.

//(Silas puts the camera down and sits next to Adam)//

**Silas:** I&#39;ve got to practice, y&#39;know?  

**Adam:** Yeah, I know. You never shut up about this kid. I bet you&#39;re real excited for all of the diapers, crying, and mashed up food. It sounds like a dream.  

**Silas:** Well, it&#39;s not just that. At first, sure, I was terrified of the responsibility. But now, the idea of having a kid... someone entirely new, created by me. I can&#39;t wait to watch him grow up. I can already see him reaching higher than the stars. 

**Adam:** Yup, bet he&#39;ll be the next Socrates. 

**Silas:** Well, I don&#39;t know about that- you&#39;re being sarcastic, aren&#39;t you? 

**Adam:** If I was, I wouldn&#39;t admit it.

**Silas:** Fair enough. It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve actually been on a beach. I&#39;m glad we stopped here. 

**Adam:** It&#39;s been way too long since you&#39;ve gone anywhere outside of the city. 

**Silas:** Mhm. Hey Adam, do you remember that one summer we found that small beach in our hiking trail? It was hidden a couple meters behind that really big rock that you&#39;d always try to climb.

**Adam:** Yeah, I remember. We only went there once or twice after realizing it belonged to that guy who put fences up everywhere. How old were we, 12?

**Silas:** Those were much simpler times, huh? Wish we would go back sometime.

**Adam:** We can&#39;t go back there. Even if you want to, you&#39;ve got to move on.

**Silas:** Aw, come on. Maybe that guy with the fence will let us hang out over there, just for an hour.

**Adam:** Oh, I thought you meant- never mind.

**Silas:** I could bring my old gardening shovel and you could bring that paint bucket you used as a pail. 

**Adam:** Almost forgot about that thing, I probably threw it out.

**Silas:** I hope not, that bucket&#39;s been through a lot. 

**Adam:** Like when we pretended it was a spaceship when you wanted to make a sci fi movie. 

**Silas:** I was ahead of my time. 

**Adam:** And don&#39;t forget that time we used it to collect the hermit crabs on the beach and keep them as pets.

**Silas:** Oh yeah! That was a terrible idea.
 
**Adam:** They lasted probably only a day. 

**Silas:** Now that I remember it, that was a little fucked up. In hindsight, we probably should&#39;ve realized that crabs cant just sit in an old bucket with no actual nutrients.

**Adam:** It wasn&#39;t because of the food. The crabs tore each other apart by the time we checked the next morning. 

**Silas:** Wait, really? That&#39;s horrific. I don&#39;t remember that. 

**Adam:** Apparently crabs do that all the time. Its this weird thing with them- but yeah, I don&#39;t want to remember it either. 

**Silas:** Lets try to forget it then. Anyways, aren&#39;t you going to ask me what we&#39;re going to name him?

**Adam:** What do you mean?

**Silas:** Ask me what I named my son!

**Adam:** I assumed you hadn&#39;t decided yet. 

**Silas:** Come on, ask me!

**Adam:** //Sighs// What&#39;re you going to name him?

**Silas:** Adam!

**Adam:** What do you want?

**Silas:** No, that&#39;s his name dumbass.

**Adam:** You&#39;re naming your kid... Adam? Why?

**Silas:** Not the reaction I was expecting. I asked Lida and she said she liked it. You&#39;ve been my best friend since forever, I want my son to be my best friend too. 

**Adam:** I didn&#39;t ask you to name him after me.

**Silas:** I didn&#39;t expect you to. Are you okay, Adam? You&#39;ve been acting strange this whole trip. 

**Adam:** Listen man, I&#39;m fine. Coming to this island was a mistake. I think we should get going. 

**Silas:** What? Did I say something wrong?

**Adam:** No, its not that.

**Silas:** Then what is it? I&#39;m enjoying your company here, Adam. Why do I get the feeling that you don&#39;t feel the same way?

**Adam:** It&#39;s nothing. Really, it isn&#39;t. 

**Silas:** It&#39;s not nothing, Adam. Why can&#39;t you tell me what it is?

**Adam:** Can you just stop?

**Silas:** Stop what?

**Adam:** Just stop it, Silas. Stop pretending to care.

**Silas:** What are you talking about? I&#39;m not pretending anything! 

**Adam:** Seriously? After such a long time, you still won&#39;t admit it?

**Silas:** What&#39;s your problem, Adam?

**Adam:** You want to know my problem? How about your probloem? Ever since we left college, you&#39;ve been ghosting me. All you know how to do is take and leave. 

**Silas:** What are you talking about? I&#39;ve just been busy! With things like work and the pregnancy, I had a lot going on.

**Adam:** Stop throwing excuses in my face!

**Silas:** Excuses? They&#39;re reasons!

//(Silas and Adam both stand and begin arguing.)//

**Adam:** I don&#39;t care about your reasons! You still ditched me!

**Silas:** I didn&#39;t ditch you. I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t have as much free time as you. I&#39;d at least think you&#39;d be happy for me.

**Adam:** Of course I&#39;m happy for you! But its hard to stay happy for you when you don&#39;t even answer my calls! What if I died or something?

**Silas:** I don&#39;t understand what&#39;s wrong with you. You&#39;re my best friend, but I can&#39;t just drop things for you! 

**Adam:** Drop everything? I&#39;m not even a priority, am I? Probably just some person on the side who you can humor on occasion. 

**Silas:** Are we not hanging out right now? I&#39;ve been stressed out of my mind, but I was looking forward to this! I can&#39;t believe you right now. 

**Adam:** I&#39;m just so //sick// of you walking all over me!

**Silas:** Listen to yourself, Adam! That&#39;s not fair of you to say.

**Adam:** Don&#39;t talk to me about what&#39;s fair. You&#39;re the one with the nice job and the loving family. Meanwhile I get nothing. 

**Silas:** Oh, get it now.

**Adam:** You finally understand?

**Silas:** Yeah, I do. You&#39;re not angry with me, Adam, you&#39;re jealous of me!

**Adam:** I&#39;m- what? How big of an ego do you have?

**Silas:** Just admit it! You&#39;ve been awful this whole trip because you can&#39;t stop sitting in your own self pity.

**Adam:** You know what? I need to go cool off. 

//(Adam proceeds to walk out of view. Silas sighs and puts his hands over his face. He then murmurs to himself.)//

**Silas:** I don&#39;t get it. You were the one who wanted to stop at this stupid island and take a picture in the first place.

//(Silas walks over and picks up the camera.)//

**Silas:** Shit, I was recording, wasn&#39;t I? I&#39;ll delete it later. Come on Adam, wait!

**VR-5638B**

//VR-5638B begins with video static for 00:12 seconds. At 00:13 seconds, the video feed gains visual clarity. Due to the audio, it was determined that the recording had been taken underwater. At 00:15 seconds, small white lights can be seen flickering in the further depths of the water. The flickering lights begin to increase in size as the camcorder sinks deeper into the water. More white lights begin to manifest as a large, black silhouette emerges into view from an unknown depth. At 00:20 seconds, two abnormally large pincers briefly appear in the center of the screen. At 00:25 seconds, a voice begins speaking from behind the recording. The [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4453|voice]]] is feminine in tone, and says://

Does it feel good to think yourself as above the stars?
Is it satisfying to cover your soul with a shell of self pity?
A bubbling trench of pettiness lies in the depths of all our hearts.
Karkinos tried to kill Herakles, but was crushed under his foot.
Now you will be crushed with it. Crushed under your own self righteousness.
Do you see it? Do you see Karkinos within the stars?
It sees you.
Or rather, it sees the bucket. 

//&lt;VR-5638B ends.&gt;//
[[/div]]
 The camcorder was discovered by MTF personnel and is currently in a storage locker located at Site-17. 12 meters from the video recorder, the decomposed remains of PoI-5638-33 was identified. Autopsy reports show that PoI-5638-33 had been chopped apart with precise incisions. PoI-5638-34 was never found. 
All living SCP-5638-A instances were then collected and transported to Site-17. Currently, every SCP-5638-A instance has claimed to have no memory of possessing the camcorder, or even seeing it. The meaning of VR-5638B is currently unknown. The name mentioned, Karkinos, appears in Greek mythology. The name belonged to a crab that tried to kill Herakles in the story //The Twelve Labors//. The crab was killed by Heracles, and then turned into the constellation Cancer.
