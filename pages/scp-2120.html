**Item #:** SCP-2120

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Instances of SCP-2120 are to be contained and towed to an appropriate Foundation-controlled harbor for further investigation. In the event that an instance of SCP-2120 is believed to be an immediate threat to exploration teams or civilian vessels, MTF Gamma-6 &#34;Dry Docks&#34; has been authorized to use necessary force in order to neutralize any danger the instance might pose. Information and technology recovered from instances of SCP-2120 are to be moved to Site-65 for testing and cataloging.

**Description:** Instances of SCP-2120 are various anomalous naval vessels that randomly appear in an area roughly 500 km in diameter near the island of Bermuda in the Atlantic Ocean. SCP-2120 instances seemingly materialize approximately 1.7 km below the ocean surface, and then rapidly ascend to sea level, where they come to rest. Along with being thoroughly flooded[[footnote]]Instances of SCP-2120 will non-anomalously empty of excess liquid after a short period of time above water.[[/footnote]], SCP-2120 instances occasionally show signs of external distress. Most damaged functions tend to be non-insulated electrical, nuclear, and gravitational devices onboard the vessels, although major structural compromises are not uncommon. 

SCP-2120 vary in model, ranging from those resembling Phoenician triremes, to 18th century Ships-of-the-Line, to modern aircraft carriers. Additional vessels have been observed; however, no modern or historical counterpart for these instances have been identified. Regardless of their construction, all recovered instances of SCP-2120 have been fitted with a number of advanced technologies, the majority of which are in various states of disrepair. //For a list of recovered instances and their anomalous technologies, see Addendum 2120-1//.

SCP-2120 instances all bear the name of what is currently believed to be their original designer, &#34;Boeing Aquatics&#34;. Investigations into the Boeing Company of North America have ruled out any correlation between the two groups. Recovered information from SCP-2120 instances indicate that Boeing Aquatics is a sea-faring vessel manufacturer originating in the city of Nu-Boston, the capital of the Confederate Socialist Colonies of the New World. According to this information, the CSCNW[[footnote]]Currently believed to be a conglomeration of most of North, Central, and South America.[[/footnote]] was involved in a large-scale arms race with two aggressor nations, the Lord God&#39;s Eternal Anglican Union and the Khan Empire. Research into the potentially extradimensional origin of SCP-2120 instances is ongoing. 

**Addendum 2120-1:** Recovered SCP-2120 instances.
|| **Designation** || **Vessel Name** || **Date of Appearance** || **Anomalous Characteristics** ||
|| 2120-02 || C.C.S. Air Lana || 02/13/1985 || //Instance resembles a 19th century clipper ship, notably modified for military use instead of trade. Several large gun mounts are present on the deck, but all were found empty. A device that appears to be a non-functional cold fusion reactor was found below deck, purpose unknown. Hull is composed entirely of plastic.// ||
|| 2120-08 || C.C.S. Vigo Kennedy || 08/02/1987 || //Instance resembles a modern cruise ship. Interior of the vessel has been fitted with a large number of cryogenic stasis pods, many of which appear to have been broken open by force. A large, black, cylindrical mechanism sits within the center of the main concourse, the purpose of which is unknown. The mechanism produces small amounts of alpha radiation at consistent intervals.// ||
|| 2120-10-D || C.C.S. John Henry Hitchcock || 03/28/1991 || //Instance resembles a modern [[[SCP-2956|nuclear submarine]]]. During exploration, on-board teams inadvertently activate a defense mechanism. Nearby vessels are struck with torpedoes that grossly increase the local gravity, crushing them. MTF Gamma-6 authorized to destroy instance. Wreckage moved to Site 65 for further investigation.// ||
|| 2120-13 || C.C.S. Nu-Indianapolis || 12/20/1991 || //Instance is an unidentified vessel, octopoid in nature, measuring roughly 500m from end to end. Appears to be a habitation vessel; however, it is currently believed that the manner in which 2120-13 propels itself through water was inimical to its passengers. Recovered logs indicate no tests were performed that did not end in the loss of human life.// ||
|| 2120-19 || C.C.S. Her Majesty Queen Alabama Jersey || 05/15/1994 || //Instance resembles a modern Nimitz-class aircraft carrier. Flight deck has been fitted with a number of large, cannon-like armaments. Recovered ammunition appears to have been designed to alter the atomic structure of all biological matter within its blast radius, changing it to lead.// ||
|| 2120-29 || C.C.S. Paint With All The Colors Of The Wind || 09/09/1997 || //Instance resembles a Wyoming-class battleship. Exploration has determined that the instance has been fitted with a device that can render the entire vessel invisible to the naked eye. Activating this device releases a massive amount of gamma radiation.// ||

**Collected Data Logs:** //The following log excerpts have been collected from functional terminals throughout SCP-2120 instances.//

&gt; 
&gt; Note to whoever keeps trying to install matter disruptors on the Youngtown Freemont: kind of silly to have matter disruptors on a ship fighting against ships that aren&#39;t made up of matter. Khrist, you guys need to figure it out.

&gt; 
&gt; We keep running into the same problem with the Absolute Zero drives, and it&#39;s something we&#39;re going to have to start addressing here soon. I know it&#39;s a neat idea to build a ship that creates more energy than it expends, but ruining thermodynamics might not be worth the extra money you&#39;re saving.

&gt; 
&gt; Another day, another catastrophic meltdown of the graviton core. I know we&#39;re supposed to keep our chins up about this, but honestly I feel as if we&#39;ve sent more ships back to Nu-Miami than we&#39;ve kept out on the campaign. It&#39;s a good thing the Loadmaster kept on all of those Approxima shells, too, because Khrist knows the Handlemarks fell flat on their ass.

&gt; **To:** Admiral Nabisco
&gt; 
&gt; Bottom line is, feds aren&#39;t happy with some of the stuff we&#39;re shipping out. There&#39;s already talks about &#34;crimes against humanity&#34; and &#34;human rights violations&#34;. Before you say anything about it, by the way, I understand that the Cellular Readjustment Batteries were probably ill advised. Honestly, sometimes I think that these fuckers don&#39;t even want to win the war. 
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I know stuff is getting pretty feisty right now, but when all of this blows over we&#39;re going to be staring some pretty serious shit in the eye, so we need to get this figured out fast. All of these things that aren&#39;t working, that keep falling apart, that &#34;inadvertently slaughter thousands of innocent civilians&#34;, we&#39;re going to have to find a way to get rid of them. Got to keep our hands clean here.
&gt; 
&gt; I talked to Father Mexico, and he figures he and his boys can work up something that we can just dump everything into. Shouldn&#39;t bother anybody, since we can probably pull most of the lethal stuff before we toss it. Might become a problem if the Embedded Omnicore Realignment Matrix on the C.C.S. Hoover Damn shits out, though. 
&gt; 
&gt; Either way. [[[SCP-1393|Better them than us.]]]
