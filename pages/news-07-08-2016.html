++++ Event-Featured Articles

+++++ July:

* July 3rd was Last Day of Shark Week! Part man, part fish, all business, the [[[scp-7475-j|Turbo Shark Pulverizer 6000]]] will stop at nothing to punch sharks. Because he can only punch sharks. He&#39;s not that impressive otherwise. [[*user Gargus]] brings us this unholy beast. For shark-punching!
* July 29th was International Tiger Day! Don&#39;t be fooled; this may just look like an ordinary kitten, but it&#39;s actually a vicious tiger. Oh, and it looks hungry. So much for that [[[scp-247|harmless kitten]]] look after all. Thanks, [[*user Alias Pseudonym]], for instilling that seed of doubt in our heads.
* July 30th was International Day of Friendship! Friendships build bridges between people, whether you see their faces often or not often at all. Take a moment to think of your friends, both old and new, and visit [[[SCP-1252]]] (A Half-Formed Idea) by [[*user SoullessSingularity]].

+++++ August:

* August 15th was Happy National Relaxation Day! A chance to take a moment today to breathe deeply, reflect on what makes you happy, and maybe share a cup of tea on a tropical island with [[[SCP-2255]]] (&#34;The Most Interesting Rainstorm in the World&#34;) by [[*user Zyn]].
* August 21st was World Fashion Day! Celebrate the art of fashion today! [[[SCP-2353]]] (&#34;The Mannequin That Will No Longer Put Up With This Shit, Honestly&#34;) by [[*user SoullessSingularity]] certainly has a few things to say about the topic.
* August 22nd was National Eat a Peach Day! For those of us saying goodbye to those fleeting days of summer, take a moment to appreciate the sunshine. Perhaps have a peach or two... just not one from [[[SCP-891 | this California Field]]], [[*user Chubert]] tells us.

++++ Rest of the News

* Let&#39;s give a warm welcome and hearty congratulations to the brand new [http://scp-wiki-de.wikidot.com/ German SCP Wiki]!

+++++ Art from July:

* To start things off nice and simple, how about a crushing photoset of [http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=58170669 Bright&#39;s family]? Thank you to [http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=15521968 飛鳥] for those feels.
* And how about a really amazing ad of Dr. Wondertainment&#39;s Ontological 6-Balls? I&#39;ve featured [http://iscreammaker.tumblr.com/ I Scream Maker] here before I believe, but their art is always rad, and this is a super awesome ad, so check it out [http://iscreammaker.tumblr.com/post/146789659494/scp-609-dr-wondertainments-ontological here]!
* We all know and love Documents Recovered from the Marianas Trench. Now imagine that in [http://fukutwin.tumblr.com/post/147050021365/document-recovered-from-the-marianas-trench-by mini-comic form]! This comes to us cortusey of [http://fukutwin.tumblr.com/ Fukumen55].
* I love odd art styles, especially when they compliment the subject. This [http://skippercifer.tumblr.com/post/147433456409/anyway-heres-my-favorite-scp sparse drawing] of SCP-469 suits it very well I think, and it&#39;s brought to you by [http://skippercifer.tumblr.com Skippercifer]!
* The [http://fondationscp.wikidot.com/ French branch] of ours is wonderful and teeming full of lore. In particular, a //60-tale+ long// canon called [http://fondationscp.wikidot.com/apres-aleph After Aleph]! Here are some [http://psychologist-frog.tumblr.com/post/147538791991/so-recently-i-decided-to-try-my-hand-at-graphic graphic design posters] of this canon, from http://psychologist-frog.tumblr.com/ Dr. Frog]. Go check it out and give them some love!
* And finally, because why not, [http://wondertainmenttoys.tumblr.com/post/147912417407/reach-682-followers-and-the-blog-comes-to-life 682 pinata] brought to you by the good [http://wondertainmenttoys.tumblr.com Dr. Wondertainment].

+++++ Art from August:

* Kicking off August, I present to you one of many cool fanarts I frequently find of [http://sumiwow.tumblr.com/post/148867756957/httpwwwscp-wikinetscp-2521 SCP-2521]. Both cute and terrifying! Thank you [http://caradan.tumblr.com/ dansen]!
* And to fufill my 2521 quota (seriously guys, there&#39;s a lot), have [http://sumiwow.tumblr.com/post/148867756957/httpwwwscp-wikinetscp-2521 this goofy one] of a D-Class running away from 2521. It just wants to love u ;_; It comes from the wonderful [http://sumiwow.tumblr.com/ Sumiwow]!
* Do you like video game-esque sprites of SCPs? Well, I&#39;m here to scratch that specific itch of yours. My favorite of the bunch from the artist [http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=3316434 おもちゃ好き屋さん] is this art of [http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=58264047 SCP-2317&#39;s containment procedures]. How goofy! You can find a lot more on their profile.
* For some reason, Osomatsu-san crossovers seem to be popular. Doesn&#39;t quite seem like something that&#39;d mix, but I&#39;m fine with it, especially if it brings us cute art like [http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=58574536 this &#39;un] of Jyushimatsu and SCP-131! Thank you for this adorable art [http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=17521890 リッツ].
* Everyone&#39;s favorite homicidal lizard is best when being ugly and angry, and that&#39;s exactly what we get with [http://wildragon.tumblr.com/post/149433390796/a-quick-scp-682-drawing this] from [http://wildragon.tumblr.com/ Wildragon]. Baring its teeth and snarling at you... perfect!
* [http://sinsekai20130227.tumblr.com/ Sinsekai] has definitely been on here before, but it&#39;s been a while, so here are [http://sinsekai20130227.tumblr.com/post/149604034359/scp-2559-j-scp-1183-scp-cn-756-scp-1689 four] cute, simple portraits of SCP-2559, 1183, CN-756, and 1689. Criminally underrated; check them out.
* And to close out the art for this month, have some really neat and cute but still slightly off-putting art of [https://kibadori-rue.tumblr.com/post/149369171804/scp-2636-djoric SCP-2636], brought to us by [https://kibadori-rue.tumblr.com/ KIBADORI_Rue]. Aww, look at it!

Thanks for tuning in again, folks! If you write an article and it sticks, //please// send Decibelle, A Random Day, or rumetzen a blurb for your article. We may or may not use it (if we can think of something more attention-getting, though we can try to stick with one you give us) but we&#39;d really would just like them in order to make the process easier for making these. In addition, this is a community thing, and I want authors to give their blurbs to sell these articles much easier. It reduces the workload I and the people helping me have to do, and helps the news come out that much earlier!

Thank you ARD and rumetzen for helping me out! I did the first half (plus intro + outro + fandom stuff), they did the second half.

Furthermore, I&#39;d still like to know if anyone is interested in an art contest! I did get some good feedback last time, but would like more just to see if it&#39;s sustainable and viable. Thank you all for continuing to be an excellent community &lt;3
