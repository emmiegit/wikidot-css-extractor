**Special Containment Procedures:** Yaeger Aural Relays are to be maintained until January 21st, 2022. ##blue|The Glaick-Hall family is to remain under surveillance indefinitely until SCP-5971 can be confirmed neutralized with absolute certainty.##

--SCP-5971 has been declared Neutralized.-- ##blue|SCP-5971 is currently pending reclassification.##

&gt; **Interview Log:** The following interview was conducted on January 21st, 2018.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Agent Mallory
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewee:** Mr. Joseph Glaick
&gt; ------
&gt; **&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Mallory:** Thank you for agreeing to this interview, Mr. Glaick. And apologies for approaching you while you are busy with your job.
&gt; 
&gt; **Joseph:** Yeah, sure. Sorry about my dad.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mallory:** It&#39;s no problem at all. We, uh, should have expected that he&#39;d be a little less than kind to us.
&gt; 
&gt; **Joseph:** Right. So, what&#39;s this about?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mallory:** Six years ago we spoke with your parents about some personal matters for the Wisconsin Societal Census Polity. When we were going through our follow-ups list, your family&#39;s file had been flagged for review. It won&#39;t take long. Fifteen minutes at the most and we&#39;ll get out of your hair.
&gt; 
&gt; **Joseph:** Alright. Yeah, I can do that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mallory:** Excellent. Now, just to have it on record, you consent to having this interview recorded, yes?
&gt; 
&gt; //Brief silence.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Mallory:** Verbally, please.
&gt; 
&gt; **Joseph:** Uh, sure. Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mallory:** Perfect.
&gt; 
&gt; //Sound of paper shuffling, followed by a pen click.//
&gt; 
&gt; [IRRELEVANT DATA REMOVED]
&gt; 
&gt; **Mallory:** We&#39;re almost finished. I just want to thank you so far for your cooperation.
&gt; 
&gt; **Joseph:** It&#39;s no problem. I&#39;m kinda surprised you didn&#39;t already have that information.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mallory:** Just trying to be thorough. Now, when we visited back in 2012, the subject of your sister, Sophia, came up. I want to know a little more about that. Is that okay?
&gt; 
&gt; **Joseph:** Um... Yeah. Yeah, that should be fine.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mallory:** Thank you. It&#39;s my understanding that she has passed. Do you remember anything about the event of her passing?
&gt; 
&gt; **Joseph:** Okay, that&#39;s kind of... that&#39;s a big question.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mallory:** If it&#39;s troublesome, we can move onto something--
&gt; 
&gt; **Joseph:** No no, it&#39;s fine. It&#39;s... It&#39;s a lot. I&#39;m better about it now. I can talk about it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mallory:** Whenever you&#39;re ready then.
&gt; 
&gt; //Joseph takes a deep breath, holding it for a second before letting it out slowly.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Joseph:** It was really late at night. I was up playing video games with my brother Canton. Just what we did, you know? I wasn&#39;t out causing trouble. You probably knew that, though. Well, anyway, I&#39;m playing games with Canton and I hear someone fall in the other room. Sure enough, Sophie&#39;s, um, having another seizure.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mallory:** Did she have seizures a lot?
&gt; 
&gt; **Joseph:** Not a lot, but she was getting them more often. She was getting older, much older than what the doctors gave us when she was born. We were happy she made it to twelve... Anyway, me and Canton start moving. I went to make sure Sophie was okay, Canton would try to get mom out of bed.
&gt; 
&gt; //Joseph takes another deep breath.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Joseph:** She was on the floor when I found her, but she wasn&#39;t moving. So, I panic. Mike shared a room with her, but he wasn&#39;t home and I didn&#39;t know CPR like he did. I tried calling out to her, you know. Check if she was responsive and awake. And she didn&#39;t make any noise.
&gt; 
&gt; //Joseph&#39;s breathing becomes slightly labored.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Joseph:** I tried. I got on the floor and tried to give her CPR myself. I had to do something, I had to. &#34;I can&#39;t lose my sister, I can&#39;t lose my sister,&#34; just having that going through my head when mom comes through screaming and Canton is outside crying and dad is on the phone trying to get help. I&#39;m just there trying to do what I can, you know?
&gt; 
&gt; //Joseph pauses. He takes a few deep breaths.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Mallory:** Anything else?
&gt; 
&gt; **Joseph:** That&#39;s what&#39;s strange. I don&#39;t really remember much else. I remember still giving Sophie CPR when the ambulance arrived. I remember walking with them into the hospital. I remember coming back home without a sister. I know stuff happened in between, but it&#39;s all a blur. I remember it being so quiet while it was all happening, like all the blood rushed to my head and covered my ears or something.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mallory:** I see. Any idea what might have caused that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Joseph:** My therapist thinks that I&#39;m trying to block out the trauma still, so I guess that. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s really worth remembering.
&gt; 
&gt; //Sound of a pen click and shifting papers.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Mallory:** Alright. Well, thank you for your time today, Joe. If we need anything else, we&#39;ll be sure to... Joe?
&gt; 
&gt; //A sharp nasal inhale is heard.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Mallory:** Mr. Glaick? Are you okay?
&gt; 
&gt; **Joseph:** Yeah, yeah. I&#39;m fine. It&#39;s just... I didn&#39;t know that, you know... it&#39;s been so long. After all this time, I didn&#39;t think that it would still be so...
&gt; 
&gt; //Twenty minutes of silence.//
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;END LOG&gt;**
