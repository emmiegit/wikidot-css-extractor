SCP-5239 is contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, outfitted with a bed, a desk, and a bookshelf containing several non-horror related books, rotated monthly. SCP-5239 is allowed to exit the chamber once a day for exercise in the courtyard, contingent on general compliance. SCP-5239-1 materials should be locked away separately from SCP-5239 and only returned during testing.

Under no circumstances should SCP-5239 be addressed as Abraxas, Dread-Master of Darkness, High Necromancer of Hell, The Seventh Servant of Satan or any similarly thematic names.

++++ **__Description__**
SCP-5239 is Blaine Veers, a 17 year old human from Trenton, New Jersey. SCP-5239 is a Type III-Limited[[footnote]]Those that are unable to bend reality outside of consistent areas or themes.[[/footnote]] reality bender, but is only capable of performing anomalous feats when equipped with SCP-5239-1-A through D.

SCP-5239-1-A is a hardcover book claiming to be the fictional //Necronomicon// from the works of author H.P. Lovecraft.[[footnote]]No author is mentioned, although the publisher is labelled as an [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3665|Asmodeus Labs]]].[[/footnote]] SCP-5239-1-A is filled with instructions in poorly-translated Latin claiming to be spells of various facets of necromancy, from divining with spirits to raising the deceased as zombies. When not being used by SCP-5239, the book is entirely non-anomalous.

SCP-5239-1-B through E are a black robe, a pair of red eye contacts, a pair of black leather fingerless gloves, and a tube of black eyeliner. SCP-5239 claims the usage of these items during testing enhances its anomalous abilities. However, instances can be swapped out for similar products with little to no change in performance.

++++ **__Discovery__**
SCP-5239 came to the Department of Spectral Phenomena&#39;s attention on 08/11/2019, after numerous police reports of disturbances at a local graveyard. Witnesses reported seeing trespassers dressed as ghosts that vanished upon attempts to apprehend them.

Undercover operatives set up hidden cameras throughout the site, noticing SCP-5239 among the spectral entities. Foundation operatives later tracked SCP-5239 to a local bookstore, taking them into Foundation custody.

[[collapsible show=&#34;● Interview 28/11/2019 ●&#34; hide=&#34;○ Interview 28/11/2019 ○&#34;]]
**Interviewer:** Dr Adrian Bliss

**Interviewed:** SCP-5239

= **[BEGIN LOG]**

**Bliss:** Hi, nice to meet you. I&#39;m Adrian Bliss, I&#39;ll be interviewing you today. Do you prefer Mx Veers, or just Ashley?

**SCP-5239:** Call me Abraxas, Necromancer of Hell.

**Bliss:** ...No.

**SCP-5239** Uh. Then I guess you can, uh, call me- name&#39;s Blaine Veers.  You can just call me Blaine. Don&#39;t really go by Ashley anymore. Um, sir.

**Bliss:** Appreciate it, but there&#39;s no need to call me sir.  Now, I wanted to talk to you about your abilities. Approximately when did you first realize you could reanimate corpses?

**SCP-5239:** I guess about a few weeks ago? Day or two after my birthday. Didn&#39;t feel like sticking around home, so I headed downtown to the library. Wasn&#39;t really anything I liked that I hadn&#39;t read-

**Bliss:** //[taking notes]// Sorry, what was the name of the place?

**SCP-5239:** It was just the public library. One on Main and tenth?

**Bliss:** Oh. //[Erasing notes]// Continue, please.

**SCP-5239:** Anyways, wasn&#39;t anything I liked. But there was this one thing- They had this weird donated books section, you could go through there for a dollar. Nothing good, but I found this one book, part of some Halloween costume I think. And I was already planning on dressing up for Halloween, thought it&#39;d make a good prop. Went home, flipped through it, then next thing I knew I was talking to the ghost of some Viking dude.

**Bliss:** How did that go?

**SCP-5239:** Heh, not really that great. He tried to slice me in half, until I found the spell to throw him back. Threw the book under my bed for a while, tried to forget about it. Didn&#39;t really want to give my parents an excuse to- never mind.

I forgot about it for a while, then eventually pulled it out again. Started small, like roadkill or mice. Things that people wouldn&#39;t notice.

**Bliss:** And then the cemetery ruckus. What exactly were you doing there at 1AM, anyways?

**SCP-5239:** Oh, that. I... I, um, just needed some fresh air. Thought I&#39;d go to the cemetery to practice.

**Bliss:** I see. One more thing about your recovery. When our task force apprehended you, you were wearing...  &#39;one black robe, fingerless gloves, a pair of blood-red eye contacts, and one tube of black eyeliner.&#39; A Halloween costume, I&#39;m assuming. Were those included with the book?

**SCP-5239:** Nah, I bought those from a costume shop. It&#39;s kinda weird. I tried putting them on, and it seemed to work? Could do some of the more complicated spells. Sounds like bullshit, I know, but it works. Same with the name. Once I started acting like a goddamn goth kid, I had more energy.

**Bliss:** Interesting. I&#39;ll make sure they hold onto those. One more thing: Why&#39;d you continue with the book? I&#39;m not an expert, but I feel like most teenagers would be-

**SCP-5239:** Scared? Uncomfortable? It&#39;s magic. May be necromancy, but it&#39;s still fucking magic. Who&#39;d throw that away?

**Bliss:** Fair enough. Thank you for your time.

//SCP-5239, equipped with SCP-5239-1, enters the testing room.//

**Bliss:** Good morning, Blaine. How are the new books?

**SCP-5239:** Pretty good, I guess. Any chance I can get the fifth one in the series as well? Think it&#39;s come out by now.

**Bliss:** I&#39;ll see what I can do. But for now, we should get on with the testing.

//SCP-5239 steps forward, looking at the corpse of D-2343 on the table.//

**SCP-5239:** Uh... You didn&#39;t kill this guy just for the testing, did you?

**Bliss:** Of course not, that would be an utter waste. Bad case of appendicitis.

**SCP-5239:** ...

**Bliss:** Is something wrong, Blaine?

**SCP-5239:** Sorry, I&#39;m just not really used to seeing dead bodies. Like, I usually stuck with ghosts, and most of the skeletons had all their fleshy bits rotted away. A bit hard to look at.

**Bliss:** If you&#39;d rather deal with a skeleton, we can swap that-

**SCP-5239:** No, it&#39;s fine, it&#39;s fine. I can do this.

//SCP-5239 takes a deep breath, and then begins reciting a passage from SCP-5239-1-A.//

**SCP-5239:** Exurge a mortuis, ex carne homo. Exurge a mortuis, et ambules in sempiternum et egressus de loco spiritus mundi. Et tu iubes![[footnote]]&#34;Arise from death, man of feeble flesh. Arise from death, and walk forevermore as an exile from the spirit world. I command you!&#34;[[/footnote]]

//Hume detectors record a 20% dip from baseline reality.//

//D-2343&#39;s body jerks up.//

**D-2343:** Uh....

**Bliss:** D-2343, can you hear me?

//D-2343 moans intelligibly, falling off the table.//

**D-2343:** Brains...

**Bliss:** D-2343, please respond in the affirmative if you can hear me.

//D-2343 begins walking around the chamber, arms raised in a stereotypical &#34;zombie&#34; pose.//

**SCP-5239:** Um, hold on, hold on....  Da mihi absconditorum es cognitor, immortuorum augentes![[footnote]]&#34;Give me your secrets, undead!&#34;[[/footnote]]

**D-2343:** Secreta immortuos non vestrum est scire. Cessabunt sive perpetuo versatus est.[[footnote]]&#34;The secrets of the undead are not yours to know. Cease, or be forever haunted by them!&#34;[[/footnote]]

**Bliss:** Hmm. Have you ever held a conversation with any reanimated persons before, Blaine?

**SCP-5239:** Well, kind of? I mean I can tell them what to do; grab that book, open that door, scare off that kid... I mean I didn&#39;t really think about talking to them that much, sorry I should&#39;ve had this checked out, I&#39;m really sorry-

**Bliss:** It&#39;s nothing. Can you recite the counterspell now?

//SCP-5239 recites the counterspell, and D-2343 falls to the ground. Hume levels return to baseline.//

**Bliss:** Thank you, that will be all for today.

**SCP-5239:** ..Sorry. Did I mess something up?

**Bliss:** What? No, you seemed to have followed the instructions well. We can hardly fault a 17 year-old for not speaking Latin. Marshall, can you show them back to- thank you. See you tomorrow.

//While we&#39;ve been searching for a solution to our little [[[SCP-5370|blackroom]]] problem,  it seems SCP-5239 is not that answer. Rather than bending reality to reanimate the consciousness of the deceased,  SCP-5239 instead appears to instead manipulate the body into a crude display of life. Its creations are more fleshy/incorporeal automatons rather than true reanimations.//

//Considering the costs required to properly maintain our SRAs, and the exceedingly narrow circumstances in which SCP-5239 can even be recognized as anomalous, I&#39;m proposing we amnesticize and release it back into the civilian world. No further value can be gained by its containment. -Doctor Bliss//

**Interviewer:** Dr Bliss

**Interviewed:** SCP-5239

= **[BEGIN LOG]**

**Bliss:** Well, looks like I&#39;ve got some good news today.

**SCP-5239:** What, you&#39;re letting me paint my room black?

**Bliss:** No, not that. But I&#39;ve put in a request to my superiors, and it looks like we&#39;ll be releasing you soon. There&#39;s still a few details left to tie up, but-

**SCP-5239:** You&#39;re... you&#39;re letting me go?

**Bliss:** Yes, Blaine. You&#39;ll be back home by the end of the week. So it looks like this will be our last interview. If there&#39;s anything you want to ask about the process, now&#39;s the time.

**SCP-5239:** Can I stay here?

**Bliss:** ...What? You want to stay here, at the Foundation?

//SCP-5239 nods.//

**SCP-5239:** I mean, I know I messed up the last test, but I can do other things. Like I could make zombies or something for you guys to use. I can be useful. Can I stay?

**Bliss:** One moment.

[[collapsible show=&#34;[FURTHER STATEMENTS REDACTED AS PER HIPPOCRATES PROTOCOL; ACCESS REQUIRES 
ETHICS COMMITTEE OR OVERSEER PERMISSION]&#34; hide=&#34;[Override Granted]&#34;]]
**Bliss:** Why on earth would you want to stay at the Foundation? What&#39;s this about?

**SCP-5239:** I, I just wanna stay here. I like it here.

**Bliss:** Really. And this doesn&#39;t have anything to do with your parents?

**SCP-5239:** You-you talked to them?

**Bliss:** They attempted to file a missing person&#39;s report a few days ago, so we sent some people to collect their statements.  They seem to think you ran away from home.

**SCP-5239:** ...Please don&#39;t make me go back.

//Bliss sighs.//

**Bliss:** The Foundation isn&#39;t a place for kids, Blaine. Believe me, you shouldn&#39;t be here voluntarily. I get that there&#39;s been issue with your parents, but you need to think-

**SCP-5239:** //Issues?// Bullshit. You know what they did when I told them I was non-binary? They just laughed and told me to stop making stuff up. Guess what they did when I asked them if I could change my name.

**Bliss:** I wouldn&#39;t presume to know.

**SCP-5239:** They told me to stop being so ungrateful, and then went through my closet and threw away every pair of pants or jeans I owned. Told me to act how I &#34;actually&#34; was, like a girl, or they&#39;d send me to one of those pray away the gay-type of camps.

**Bliss:** I&#39;m sorry. Truly, I am.

**SCP-5239:** When I found the book, it just felt freeing. Stupid, I know, but for a moment I wasn&#39;t some kid with a crappy life and crappy parents. I was just some badass necromancer with zombies and ghosts.

**Bliss:** You won&#39;t be able to take the book with you, I&#39;m afraid. You reanimating bodies left and right presents an unacceptable risk to normalcy, it stays with us.

**SCP-5239:** You&#39;re still sending me back? I-

**Bliss:** Listen to me. This, the Foundation, is effectively indefinite suspension without parole. You&#39;ll be living in a cell for the rest of your life. Occasionally, if you&#39;re lucky, you might be able to take a few walks outside, guards accompanying you every step of the way. You don&#39;t get your own clothing, or get to go outside on your own, or have any communication with the outside world. Letting you stay here would not be a kindness, it would be cruelty.

**SCP-5239:** But-

**Bliss:** Trust me. Next week, you&#39;ll be dropped off at a youth shelter in Philadelphia. There&#39;s some secrecy concerns with dropping you too close to home. From there, you can take a train to Trenton. However... what you choose to do at that point is entirely up to you. Once you&#39;re out of our hands, we have no authority whatsoever over your personal life. Understand?

**SCP-5239:** Uh, yes, completely. Uh... thanks.
 
**Bliss:** Best of luck to you, Blaine.
