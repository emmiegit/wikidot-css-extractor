++ Hi! I&#39;m [[*user Dr Vikki Lost]]! This is a little guide to the official designs of all the characters from my Twin Sites series, which you can read more about [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dr-vikki-lost here.]

+++ A quick history/background for what the Twin Site&#39;s are:
&gt; &#34;During the 50s, the Foundation experienced a technological &#34;boom&#34;, with the influence growing quickly and power climbing rapidly. This led, among other things such as the [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-brief-history-of-the-foundation-s-logo 1953 Unification Act], to the mass construction of containment Sites. Due to the new influx of tech, the rate of discovery for anomalies became unmanageable, and more space was needed.
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;During this mass construction period, quality control went down, and some Sites suffered from the lack of care. This eventually came to a head when the Council signed off on the construction of Site 403 twice, which had been resubmitted after an adjustment of location.
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;The mistake wasn&#39;t caught until construction was nearly complete, and by then, two separate Sites with near identical layouts had been built side by side on the same plot of land. In the end, the Western Site was designated as Site 403, per the original plan, and the Eastern Site as Site 404.&#34;

+++ A quick history/background for what the series is about: 
&gt; The series follows the employees of Site 404/403, two Foundation Sites in Ohio known for hosting the majority of younger, less trustworthy Personnel as they train to advance in the ranks of the Foundation. Things began to change when the Sites are contacted by [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-death-of-marilla-vega Estrella Vega], the young CEO of an old-money anomaous corporation known as Lightspeed Inc. They accept her request to train her as a thaumaturge, while she helps them find and dismantle the anomalies her family created to sacrifice people to Abyssum, the Cosmic God of the Void. 
&gt; 
&gt; While Director Reynolds tries to get higher-ups to recognise the growing danger and mystery of Lightspeed Inc&#39;s plans, the rest of the Site tries to find exactly what these plans might be. Maddie Simes and Viktoralai Lost strike an unlikely alliance while they scour the corners of Unreality for clues. Ezekiah Lenora and Sam Leviticus find their way to the bottom of a paper trail. And Dr. Sage West works in the background with the mysterious [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sage-west-s-guide-to-keeping-up-disappearances Department of Disappearances] - taking her experiments to new heights to get the bottom of the Abyss, before the Abyss finds the bottom of them.

[[tab Director Emerald Reynolds]]

[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/jayeverwoodartthing/emeraldreynolds.png]]
++ Notes on drawing her:

Emerald is very professional. A black suit and slacks, a plain button up under a lab coat - those are all very her. She rarely wears jewelry, and prefers accessories with practical applications - a watch or a belt. Her hair is almost always pinned to her scalp, so it doesn&#39;t get in her way while she works. Still, she always has at least one imperfection showing, a result of her workaholic tendencies - bags under her eyes, bitten nails, or a loose strand of hair in her face.

[[tab Director Moira Fernsby]]
[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/jayeverwoodartthing/moirafernsby.png]]
++ Notes on drawing her:

Moira loves colourful clothing, bright shirts with cheesy sayings. If she wears more formal clothes, it&#39;ll usually be with some kind of floral pattern or fun stripes running down it. Personally, I think Ms. Frizzle from Magic School Bus is her fashion idol. Moira would dress like her if she could, but tends to try to stick to a more professional standard. Her goal is to radiant warmth, and appear open and likable.

[[tab Dr. Sage West]]
[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/jayeverwoodartthing/sagewest.png]]
++ Notes on drawing her:

Sage is very stylish, and more on the &#34;girly&#34; side. She prefers skirts, button-up blouses and rose gold jewelry. Usually studded earrings or a necklace polish off an outfit, and she likes to wear platforms that raise her height a bit, as she&#39;s very short. Simple makeup like blush or lip gloss would work well for her. She usually wears her hair in a braid. If it&#39;s up, it&#39;s most likely in a french twist, not just a messy bun. West loves looking nice. 

Hints of blood staining the edge of their lab coat, a rat tail sticking from her pocket, or gloves over her hands are good ways to nod to her darker side - she definitely knows how to wash blood out of a Polyester dress.

[[tab Dr. Viktoralai Amity Lost]]
[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/jayeverwoodartthing/DrLost.png]]
++ Notes on drawing them:

Wild hair, bright golden eyes. Usually more hunched, posture ruined by nerves. Lost doesn&#39;t eat much, a mix of disordered eating habits and simple forgetfulness. Eye bags are once again a common theme here. They&#39;re sensitive to a lot of fabrics, so softer cotton shirts or jeans are the best. They wear a simple black binder sometimes, with their lab coat. Their &#34;nice&#34; clothes are few and far between, but are usually fabulous pieces that they take pride in. 

[[/tab]]
[[tab Dr. Maddie Simes]]
[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/jayeverwoodartthing/maddiesimes.png]]

++ Notes on drawing it:

Maddie doesn&#39;t have a lot of physical form, so doesn&#39;t put much thought into their outfits - usually, a labcoat and some jeans will work for them. They dress gender neutrally, and rarely wear things with logos or text on them. 

Maddie can stretch themselves out into a black fog, and fit through tight spaces by basically becoming a gas. If you&#39;re confused, think Kurogiri from My Hero Academia - they have very similar designs. They wear latex gloves when working with chemicals, as it allows them to keep their hands in one shape. When they&#39;re stressed, they start appearing less dense, and might have a faint static or &#34;glitch&#34; effect to their body. Eyes might also become dimmer. 

[[/tab]]
[[tab Sam Leviticus]]
[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/jayeverwoodartthing/samleviticus.png]]

++ Notes on drawing them:

Stocky, and on the shorter side. Plain block-coloured shirts, or shirts for sitcoms or book series - Seinfeld, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, etc. Definitely owns at least one pair of crocs. Rarely wears jewelry, and avoids feminine attire for the most part. Maroon, royal blue, or sage green are their kind of colours - muted, yet fun. Probably has a few Hawain shirts mixed in there.

[[/tab]]
[[tab Adrien Hemlock]]
[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/jayeverwoodartthing/adrien%20hemlokc.png]]

++ Notes on drawing him:

Fun, colorful button-ups with simple patterns. Skinny jeans and Doc martens. He impulse-purchases most of his wardrobe,  and doesn&#39;t think much about how things fit together. Androgynous clothing with a masculine lean works well. Shorter sleeved things are usually his go-to, but he doesn&#39;t mind long sleeves if he has to. He switches out his hair colour every few months, but usually sticks to just dying the tips. Teal, mint, lavender, and coral are some faves, but pink is his super-fave.


[[/tab]]
[[tab Ezekiah Lenora]]

[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/jayeverwoodartthing/2024_01_10_0p0_Kleki.png]]

++ Notes on drawing them:

Ezekiah is nerdy and thrifty. Vintage clothes or second-hand pieces are a great idea. They&#39;d wear fun socks with sayings, and Star Wars shirts. Grammar puns too. They&#39;d probably have a TARDIS necklace, like I do. They have pierced ears, so fun earrings are also a great thing for them. In more formal contexts, they&#39;ll have simple flowy pants and Dark Academia styled clothing, like the bookworm they are.

[[tab Jackie Reed]]
[[image http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/art:site-404-403-character-designs/jackiereed.png]]

++ Notes on drawing xir: 

Jackie works in Archives at Site 403 and is famously a bit of a weirdo. Fun glasses chains, odd knick-knacks, kitschy earrings. Xe is obsessed with Lord Of The Rings, and has five cats - both of those things can be incorporated into xir outfits. Hair beads, charm bracelets. Lots of accessories. Just have fun with xir!

[[/tab]]
[[tab Estrella Vega]]

[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/jayeverwoodartthing/estrellavega]]

++ Notes on drawing her:

Estrella is an ethereal sort of beauty. She wears a lot of white and sapphire, though her wardrobe transitions to darker clothing the later on in the series she goes - the colours correlating to her loss of innocence. Lots of astronomy motifs work well, constellation patterns, planet outlines or moon phase charts being great ideas. She&#39;s old money, think fur coats and designer skirts and kitten heels. She should feel young, but **powerful**.
