Due to its nature, SCP-7021 is uncontainable. Survivors are advised to remain stationary and avoid undertaking any action that has any risk associated with it when possible.

All of the Foundation’s remaining resources are to be directed at finding the source of SCP-7021 and neutralizing it.

-------

**Description:** SCP-7021 is the process of rapid deterioration of universal probability, more commonly known as “luck”. SCP-7021 effects cause probability related events to negatively impact humanity on a global scale. The impact, scale and effect of SCP-7021 increases over time and is expected to escalate into a ZK-Class End of the World Scenario. Attempts to isolate this effect to a specific object or region have thus far been unsuccessful.

The exact nature and source of SCP-7021 are unknown. But has been observed to compromise reality through manipulation of causality (cause-and-effect) which results in the occurrence of &#39;unfavorable&#39; events of high improbability. Events previously thought to be random, improbable or highly impossible have been happening at an increased rate. This has caused several major incidents leading to the loss of human lives and overall destabilization of society. There is currently no way to counteract the effects of SCP-7021.


Through a chain reaction of improbable events the Earth has become increasingly hostile and hazardous towards all life forms. SCP-7021 has been the indirect cause of ~7.2 billion casualties over the course of 3 months.  ##red|**[DATA CORRUPTED]**##

SCP-7021 was first discovered on 26 November 20██, when Dr. Teal Nuvos, a Foundation Researcher working on Work Environment Safety Protocols discovered a notable increase in workplace related accidents at all Foundation sites.
Following the initial discovery of SCP-7021, an interview was conducted by Site Director Shatter in order to assess the threat.

**Interviewer:** Director Shatters

**Interviewee:** Researcher Nuvos

**Foreword:** Researcher Dr. Teal Nuvos was investigating Containment Procedures of several Sites to assess the risk to personnel safety. Prior to a Containment Breach at Site-19 he was active as Containment Specialist.
----


**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Director Shatters:** You can be at ease, you’re not being reprimanded or something.

**Researcher Nuvos:** Oh, great. Look, I might have dug up some reports and asked-

**Director Shatters:** We’ll consider it part of your research. Now let’s begin shall we?

**Researcher Nuvos:** //[nods]//

**Director Shatters:** I looked at your report. I don’t like what I am seeing.

**Researcher Nuvos:** Yeah- pretty much the same.

**Director Shatters:** //[flips through papers on clipboard]// Look, before I ring all kinds of alarm bells I need to be sure. You really think this isn’t some unlucky day for the Foundation? I mean, we are the Foundation after all. With the sheer number of SCPs we contain, I think it’s a miracle we managed to keep workplace accidents as low as it is.

**Researcher Nuvos:**  I don’t want to go on a tangent here, but I did the numbers. Yes, deviations are expected, with as many people as we have working for the Foundation it’s normal to have “a bad day”. But if you compare it with all the other data. What we have here is really really unlucky. Impossibly unlucky.

**Director Shatters:** If we go with your idea, of us being impossibly unlucky, that means something is happening at all Foundation sites that is causing more incidents. You think that some anomaly or GOI might think it’s funny I stubbed my toe this morning? And that, somehow, they managed to curse every Foundation site to experience minor grievances?

**Researcher Nuvos:** I don’t really know if it’s caused by a GOI. Something has to be causing these incidents but they themselves outcomes are just too random. Today, someone at Site-65 broke his arm, while at Site-126 a janitor accidentally spilled boiled water onto a D-Class. I got hundreds of  those, seemingly random, and unrelated accidents. It’s too widespread and random.

**Director Shatters:** I’ll notify the Security Department-

**Researcher Nuvos:** It’s not just that. Just yesterday, SCP-███’s Containment failed. A computer glitch. You know how rare the chance of that glitch occurring was?

**Director Shatters:** //[shakes head]//

**Researcher Nuvos:** The chance of the system failing was 0.0057% - practically impossible.. I would know - I designed the protocols myself. And even if the system fails, that protocol was designed with an in-built automatic failsafe system that will lock the Containment until manual reboot is initiated. Yet, this system still failed and the failsafe didn&#39;t trigger!

**Director Shatters:** Are you sure you are not just being paranoid? Or maybe, the system wasn’t perfect?

**Researcher Nuvos:** That&#39;s not all. In the past month alone, we have had at least 17 containment breaches that shouldn’t have happened. And 14 of them are Safe-class SCPs. I can understand the other 3, but 14 Safe-class SCP Containment Breaches and all in the same month? Are you not seeing a pattern I&#39;m seeing here?

**Director Shatters:** Aren&#39;t those simply a matter of coincidence? I fail to see how all of these events you mention fit in all this.

Researcher Nuvos: //[sighs]// Look. Something is happening. I don&#39;t know who, what, or why it is happening, but whatever it is, it&#39;s happening. Minor accidents everywhere, system errors and improbable containment breaches. The Foundation is running out of luck,  And I dare not imagine how much worse could these random series of unfortunate events occur.

**Director Shatters:** //[silence]//

**Researcher Nuvos:** I hope I&#39;m just being paranoid. I hope all these thoughts of mine are a false alarm or a bunch of nonsense. God forbid my assumptions are correct.

**Director Shatters:** I&#39;ll contact Command. We will discuss it further later.

A common cause was found between the increased rate of accidents at Foundation sites and the UIU Reports. These phenomena were subsequently designated as SCP-7021.

&#34;Miracles&#34; and &#34;Bad Omens&#34; as well as other anomalous events involving chance are reported across the country as SCP-7021 begins to spread, requiring the amnesticization of over 17,000 civilians and constant monitoring of social media.

= [[size 125%]]**Addendum 7021.10: Lifted Veil**[[/size]]
----
On 30/1/2023 All games involving chance to a notable degree began to show anomalous properties. In most cases the mechanism involved in the games did continue to function, but chance based results will result in negative results to the people involved. Most chance based games become unplayable with their original ruleset. This applied to both physical games and digital games.


The mechanisms through which SCP-7021 affects chance based games are not understood ##red|**[DATA CORRUPTED]**## or through altering local reality. ##red|**[DATA CORRUPTED]**## In situations where one bad outcome would benefit another player,

the game would often be stalled/manipulated in such a way no participant would be able to win or gain an advantage. Removing the chance aspect of a game did result in a lower chance of SCP-7021 compromise. But other aspects of the game would risk compromise.
[[include component:image-block name=DATAINVALID|caption=[DATAINVALID]|align=right|width=100px]]

Videos of this phenomenon began circulating online on social media platforms. A cover story of SCP-7021 being the effect of magnetic fields was disseminated but failed to convince the general population. A Lifted Veil Scenario followed and the ZERO CHANCE protocol was activated. Civic unrest and riots grew as a lack of explanation from the government followed.

**Procedure:** A pair of dice was given to a D-Class. He was instructed to roll the dice for 15 minutes straight.


**Results:** D-Class rolled only a 1 and a 2 for 15 minutes on camera. Subject was later blindfolded but results remained the same.


**Analysis:** SCP-7021 seems to completely affect the roll of the dice. This effect takes place even when no result is consciously observed at the time.

**Procedure:** Subject was instructed to roll a 5 or a 6 with a pair of weighted dice. These dice were manufactured to land on 6 84% of the time.

**Results:** The dice continued to land on 1s and 2s for about 95% of the time. But 5% of the time it landed on a 6.

**Analysis:** Using a weighted dice appeared to influence the roll substantially. SCP-7021 appears to be influenced to a certain degree by rigging the odds.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
//What is luck? It’s a word we use a lot, and has multiple interpretations. Technically, luck doesn’t exist. It’s a human concept, made by us, to make us believe that we or someone else has any influence over something. A secret force that gives us a pat on the back every now and then.//

//But luck is subjective at best. If we flip a coin a 100 times, and it lands on head a 100 times we like to consider ourselves lucky. Even though there’s no luck at all involved. It&#39;s a simple probability. Most likely a million other people did the same thing as you and got different results.//

//However, if we consider Luck an anomaly. Then maybe we should see it as a force that indeed causes good things to happen to us. Maybe, it changes up the deck slightly, switches up a few cards, so the odds are more favorable. Or maybe the traffic light really did wait for you, instead of you speeding up.//

//If SCP-7021 is indeed counteracting/erasing the force we humans consider luck. Then it might be better to say it’s influencing causality to negatively impact humanity. For clarity&#39;s sake of course.//

//What do I believe? I used to believe Luck wasn’t real. But that was before I started working for the Foundation. Now however, after surviving multiple containment breaches, seeing multiple ZK-class scenarios being avoided. I am starting to think Luck might be real. But not in the form of probability, instead as something else.//

SCP-7021’s effects have increased in scale and intensity. It started to impact scenarios outside of games. Almost all events in which chance and probability are involved to a degree have become susceptible to SCP-7021 compromise. The full scale of SCP-7021 anomalous effects are not completely understood by the Foundation due to its widespread nature and inconsistent behavior but it has been narrowed down to affect the following aspects the most consistently:

[[include component:image-block name=vehicleincident|caption=[DATAINVALID]|align=right|width=100px]]

* An increase in home, work and traffic related accidents occurred worldwide. The outcome of these events have ranged from minor injuries to ending with multiple fatalities. Using public infrastructure has shown to increase the risk of being affected. The health care system has been severely strained and is on the brink of collapsing. The number of total civilian casualties are unknown but ##red|**[DATA CORRUPTED OR MISSING]**##



* Cases of cardiac arrest, sporadic cancer, ischaemic strokes and other similar medical conditions started to develop at an abnormal rate in the general population. These health issues arise from either pre-existing conditions or appear spontaneously. Several  bacteria and viruses started replicating and developed mutations at an alarming rate. A global health crisis has been declared after anomalous diseases started breaching containment.  
 
* Electronic systems started malfunctioning on a regular basis. These malfunctions derive from explainable causes such as system errors, cosmic radiation or human error. Currently, the international banking system, IT infrastructure, powergrid and other critical services worldwide are at severe risk. SCP-7021 affects anomalous technology at a faster rate. As a result, multiple anomalies have either breached containment or were Neutralized due to SCP-7021 related issues. The GOI-004 “Church of the Broken God” has been declared inactive after most of its members perished. Investigation into other Paratech related GoIs has so far been unsuccessful.



Through the collective efforts of GoI-016, “The Global Occult Coalition”, GoI-014, “the Serpent&#39;s Hand” and The Foundation. Most catastrophic SCP-7021 compromised phenomena were contained and/or prevented. Through combined efforts a complete societal collapse has been prevented thus far. Currently, the Foundation’s efforts are to be directed at maintaining peace, crisis response and disaster relief. The O5 Council approved the use of various Safe class SCPs to assist in this goal.

A Meeting was held between the Overseers to discuss the situation. See log here.

&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;


**O5-1:** I’ll start with the biggest issue we have. Lack of information. What do we really know about SCP-7021? Can we even kill it? Is it an entity, a concept, a force? What is SCP-7021 really? Is it luck itself? The disappearance of it? Is it a force that’s removing it from reality, or is it disappearing on its own? 

**O5-4:** We just attached a label to it. But we are basically in the dark on this. 

**O5-10:** I believe understanding the nature of SCP-7021 is critical to containing it.

**O5-11:** You want to contain &#39;luck&#39;, is this how far we have fallen? 

**O5-6:** //[ponders]// considering what&#39;s happening, technically luck on its own can be classified as an anomaly. The status quo we worked so hard for. That might be anomalous. Did we ever look into that? Our predecessors maybe? 


**O5-5:** O5-3 was working on that. But you know, same result as before. Equipment failure, missing personnel or SCP being neutralized on accident. It’s a waste of time and resources so far. Files on the database are also deleting themselves so it’s hard to trace how far he even got.

//[Silence]//

**O5-6:** Maybe this is some kind of balancing act? We were too lucky, too much. Maybe we were overdue for some bad luck, and is SCP-7021 just the price we pay, all at once.

**O5-2:** If there’s some karmic bank of luck we owe a debt too, shouldn’t we be able to pay it off with artificial bad luck? Redirect the bad luck, can we allow it to happen in a controlled environment?

**O5-11:** That idea is just absurd. Can we get rid of superstition? Luck doesn’t exist. SCP-7021 is just another reality bending entity.


**O5-7:** If it is one, it is a rather strong, but petty one.

**O5-4:** How strong is it really though? Mostly, it affects us through probability. Nothing else. Can we just neutralize it if we locate the source?


**O5-11:** I like the idea of that.

**O5-10:** Let’s not work on assumptions. We literally can’t afford to take such a risk. I say we move slowly, try to buy ourselves time by sacrificing parts of the world. Meanwhile, we try to figure out the single path that leads to SCP-7021 neutralization.

**O5-6:** Who’s to say we have the time? If it keeps growing at this rate, most of reality will be compromised by SCP-7021 within 2 months if we are lucky, which let’s be honest. We are not.

**O5-4:** You might have jinxed us, congratulations.

**O5-11:** Stop with that superstition. It’s an anomaly, treat it as such. If it exists, we can neutralize it.

//[Arguments break out again]//

**O5-1:** //[Coughs and calls for silence]//

**O5-1:** There’s more research needed into that field. Unfortunately, SCP-7021 is somewhat of a self-keeping secret. Most research into the subject fails to deliver any substantial information.

**O5-9:** Wouldn’t that make SCP-7021 an Anti Meme?

**O5-10:** Unlikely, we are literally discussing it. It is more likely a side effect. More likely some cosmic force that has gone rogue again.

**O5-2:** A cosmic force that really loves it when people trip, that&#39;s a new one.

One D-Class had a heart attack during the ritual and [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2845|SCP-2845]]] almost broke containment.

At this rate, we can no longer guarantee the public safety from the monsters we keep. We already have several Keter SCPs missing from our custody. If we want to avoid any chance of our reality not collapsing, we need to deal with SCP-7021 while we still can at this poin, if SCP-7021 continues, a restart might not even be feasible anymore.

**O5-11:** Okay, I propose this. We change the object class of SCP-7021 to Apollyon to give us more room to work with. We override the Ethics Committee’s ruling and make neutralizing it the Foundation’s primary objective. Regardless of the costs and lifes. We have over a thousand SCPs, we’ll keep using them until SCP-7021 is neutralized.

**O5-1:** Are we really going to do this? Just throw SCP&#39;s at it until it stops?

**O5-11:** What else-

//[O5-11 starts to scratch his chest.]//

//[O5-1 and O5-6 run towards O5-11 who slumps over in his chair]//

**Administrator:** This meeting has been compromised. End it now!

&lt;END LOG&gt;
-----
**Afterword:** O5-11 suffered from a heart attack and subsequently perished. This is believed to be  the effect of SCP-7021.

&gt; **The Administrator:** From now on, the neutralization of SCP-7021 is the primary objective for the Foundation.  
[[/div]]
-----
The O5 Council greenlit extensive cross experimentation with active SCPs to increase the odds of neutralizing SCP-7021. An estimated 30% of SCPs were lost to the Foundation and 15% ended up neutralized. Most records regarding the termination attempts were lost when the nuclear device underneath Site-01 triggered on its own despite multiple fail safes.

It is unknown if any of the lost attempts managed to impact SCP-7021 in any meaningful way. Researchers did manage to extrapolate the following information about SCP-7021 from the remaining neutralization attempt logs.

* SCP-7021 compromises all of reality.

* It is immune to all memetic effects known to the Foundation.

* It targets multiple iterations of the SCP Foundation at the same time.


[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]
//SCP-7021 can be neutralized. I know it. We just need the 1 in a billion shot. We did it before. I am certain we can do it again. There’s a path that leads to victory. It’s hidden in this database, I know for sure. We still have SCPs left we haven’t used. Groups we haven&#39;t reached out to, boundaries we haven&#39;t crossed.//

//There&#39;s a way out of this situation. And it has nothing to do with luck.//
