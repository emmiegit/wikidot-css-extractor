[[tab The Cast]]
The Serpent&#39;s Hand contains a wide variety of people, each with their own skills and motives. The following characters are the focus of the series so far.

+ White Crow   
[[collapsible show=&#34;▷ The Former Librarian&#34; hide=&#34;The Former Librarian:&#34;]]
//The Leader - Plans within Plans - Ready for Anything - Lies with Conviction - Kills without Hesitation//

**Distinguishing Features:** Male of indeterminate ethnicity. Pale skin, white hair (frequently dyed), blue eyes. Slim build. Has an animate black tattoo of a serpent on his body.

&gt; A thief, a liar and a killer. Pragmatic to a fault, his dedication to the interests of the anomalous community is paired with a sociopathic indifference towards everything else. He offers a different story every time he is asked about his past, and his Library Card bears only the words &#34;Former Librarian&#34;. This would at least explain his fluency in multiple languages, living and dead, as well as an uncanny ability to navigate the labyrinthine shelving of the Wanderer&#39;s Library.  

&gt; &#34;You say I lack principles? Wrong. A man without principles, he&#39;s nothing. A leaf on the wind, blown about by self interest. But you all have too many principles, too many things you refuse to do, and it constrains you. I am a man of one principle. I have have chosen my side, and I will fight for us until we win. There is nothing more important.&#34;

&gt; POI-2021 possesses an animate tattoo similar to **[[[SCP-021]]]**, as well as access to extradimensional storage space through the pockets of his bulletproof black jacket containing a variety of mundane and paratechnological weapons and tools.  POI-2021&#39;s inherent anomalous abilities, if any, are speculative, although his improbable success at evading and impeding the Foundation remains unexplained. 

&gt; UTE-3675-Lerna is to be considered armed and dangerous at all times, both with conventional weapons and parathreat artefacts. Strike Teams should respond to any sighting of UTE-3675-Lerna with the assumption that this is a deliberate trap, and expect interference from one or more of his known associates.
[[/collapsible]]

+ Zhang Wen  
[[collapsible show=&#34;▷ The Red-Green&#34; hide=&#34;The Red-Green:&#34;]]
//The Lancer - Master of Martial Arts - Does the Impossible - Strict Moral Code  - Unarmed and Dangerous//
 
**Distinguishing Features:** Chinese male. Tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes. 160 cm tall, muscular build.

&gt; An esoteric martial artist and parapolitical dissident, Zhang Wen came to the Wanderer&#39;s Library as a fugitive from multiple normalcy preservation organisations. Unlike most followers of the &#34;White Crow&#34;, he holds himself to a strict code of conduct, insisting that their association is conditional on the avoidance of unnecessary violence. Whether this is honest naivete or wilful blindness remains to be seen.

&gt; &#34;Why do I help him? That&#39;s simple. Whatever you may think of his methods, White Crow&#39;s intent is pure. He saves lives, frees prisoners, and speaks for those that would otherwise be forgotten. So I protect him from those that would harm him, and that enables me to protect other people from him.&#34;

&gt; POI-2102 is an inwardly focused reflexive reality bender, subconsciously imposing his will on his own mind and body rather than consciously imposing it on his surroundings. This wildly fluctuating internal Hume value enables speed, strength and agility to exceed human limits, and permits movements that disregard physical laws relating to recoil, inertia and gravity. The severity of injuries is also dramatically reduced, with anything less severe than decapitation or limb loss having minimal effect on physical performance. Reality Anchors are expected to have minimal effect on POI-2102 unless deployed at extremely close proximity.

&gt; KTE-5854-Red-Green is being actively pursued by the Paranormal 19th Bureau of the People&#39;s Republic of China, has outstanding arrest warrants in most paranormal enclaves in East and South-East Asia, and has been issued with a GOC Red Notice. Despite actively interfering with at least 5 GOC operations, KTE-5854-Red-Green remains at large. GOC operatives should avoid engagement unless supported by at least two White Suits or combat-trained thaumatologists, but if possible an overwhelming force should be deployed.
[[/collapsible]]

+ Circe Galanis 
[[collapsible show=&#34;▷ The Cyborg Sorceress&#34; hide=&#34;The Cyborg Sorceress:&#34;]]
//The Brains - Computer Genius - Magic Runs Scripts in Reality - Currently Transcending her own Flesh//

**Distinguishing Features:** Californian transwoman. Brown hair (tips dyed blue), brown right eye and blue prosthetic left eye. Brain-computer interface on the back of her neck. 170 cm tall, slim build. 

&gt; Part of the Maxwellian sect of **[https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/thearchivistslog the Devout]**, Circe Atalanta Galanis&#39;s personal approach to magic combines the **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/goc-supplemental-thaumatology theories of Unified Thaumatology]** with advanced cybernetics and the logic of computer programming. Although ideologically aligned with the Serpent&#39;s Hand, her association with the &#34;White Crow&#34; appears to be primarily motivated by the desire to obtain access to certain objects and entities that would otherwise be destroyed or held by normalcy preservation organisations, apparently in the belief that they are fragments of the Broken God.  

&gt; &#34;I know exactly who I am. Always have. The world, the people in it, they&#39;re the ones that don&#39;t understand. When White Crow says we stand against all powers that be? I know exactly what he means. God is Broken. The World needs Fixing.&#34; 

&gt; POI-2048 was born Christopher Galanis in Seattle, Washington, and was noted as a computer prodigy by the age of 10. It is unclear when POI-2048 was recruited by GoI-004C, the Maxwellian sect of **[[[church-of-the-broken-god-hub| &#34;The Church of the Broken God&#34;]]]**, and it is unclear how much of POI-2048&#39;s subsequent physical transformation was driven by gender dysphoria, and how much was driven by the philosophy of transhumanism embraced by Maxwellians.   

&gt; KTE-4096-Blue-Bronze-Ford has incorporated a number of cybernetic components into her body, most notably a GenII+ brain-computer interface, although signs of implantation have been concealed by subsequent cosmetic procedures. KTE-4096-Blue-Bronze-Ford&#39;s thaumatological capabilities are informed by an (incomplete) ICSUT education, with a focus on apportation, counter-cryptography and the manipulation of light, kinetic energy and electricity.
[[/collapsible]]

+ Rahab the Amalekite 
[[collapsible show=&#34;▷ The Last of the Nephilim&#34; hide=&#34;The Last of the Nephilim:&#34;]]

//The Muscle - Elderly Giantess - Former Mercenary - Psychopathic but Professional - Useful Monster//

**Distinguishing Features:** Palestinian female (semi-human). Tanned skin, grey hair, brown eyes. 220 centimetres tall, heavy build.

&gt; The last of the Nephilim, the race of giants descended from men and angels. After spending half a century selling her strength to the highest bidder, Rahab has expressed dissatisfaction with the status quo she helped create. This apparent change of heart likely reflects the fact that the Jailors and Bookburners have no further need for monsters like her, and now regard her as just another problem to be solved. The &#34;White Crow&#34; is one of the few people within the Serpent&#39;s hand willing to make use of her extensive military experience, despite (or perhaps because of) her casual disregard for human life. 

&gt; &#34;I was useful to them. I stopped counting the people I killed. I thought that meant something. But you can&#39;t trust them, not even to act in their own self-interest. You say I switched sides, but I don&#39;t see it that way. I just joined the only war that would still have me.&#34;

&gt; Promotional material recovered from the paranormal mercenary association known as **[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/centre-de-primordial Primordial]** advertises POI-452 as a &#34;7 ft. tall giantess&#34; with &#34;the strength of ten men&#34;,  describing her as having &#34;unmatched ability in unarmed combat&#34; and proficiency with a wide variety of firearms. POI-452 is no longer associated with this Group of Interest, but retains numerous contacts in the field of anomalous mercenarism. She is best known for being the former leader of &#34;Leopard Commando&#34;, a mercenary company active in Central Africa between 1964 and 1975 for the purpose of covert operations against anomalous entities. While the full details of this organisation&#39;s activities are unknown, they are alleged to have included the execution of civilian witnesses and the targeting of political dissidents under the cover of normalcy preservation. Despite her advanced age, POI-452 remains active with minimal decline in physical ability, although she exhibits signs of slow rather than negligible senescence. 

&gt; KTE-0082-White was first encountered in 1938 by members of the British Occult Service deployed in Mandatory Palestine, investigating reports of a &#34;giant&#34; in Upper Galilee. Although the target was successfully terminated by British Occult Service operatives, his daughter (mistaken for a non-threat entity due to her youth) terminated two members of the group and wounded one more, before escaping across the border into Lebanon. KTE-0082-White was active as a mercenary in various conflicts across Africa, Europe and the Middle East from 1941 onwards. Termination was attempted in Somalia in 1994 but was unsuccessful, and the subsequent location of KTE-0082-White is unknown, despite multiple sightings in locations across Europe, Africa and the Middle East. 
[[/collapsible]]

+ Morgan Loxley
[[collapsible show=&#34;▷  The Reptilian Noble &#34; hide=&#34; The Reptilian Noble:&#34;]]

//The Face - Trained in Infiltration - Psionic Shapeshifter - Master of Disguise - Prefers Talking to Fighting//

**Distinguishing features:** British male (demi-human). Variable appearance, including variable sex. True form is a reptilian humanoid, with green scales, no hair, and yellow eyes with vertical pupils. 165 cm tall, heavy build.

&gt; A Saurian of noble birth, Loxley claims to have joined the Serpent&#39;s Hand out of a desire to advance the rights of all individuals deemed anomalous, resulting in him being disowned by his parents. However, it seems likely that his gambling debts, promiscuity and adrenochrome abuse disorder were deemed unbefitting for a member of the Reptilian Conspiracy, and that he came to the Library more out of desperation than conviction. 

&gt; &#34;Oh, White Crow? He saw potential in me, potential the rest of you overlooked. Can&#39;t say much in praise for him, he&#39;s indisputably a scoundrel, but he does know how to find talent. I give it good odds he&#39;ll be the death of me, but this is the first time I really feel like I&#39;m living!&#34;

&gt; The means through which POI-2013 impersonates Foundation Personnel is unclear, but it is believed to involve both physical alterations and psionic components. While POI-2013 &#39;s answers to questions are not always accurate, they never surprise the person asking the question, suggesting that POI-2013  obtains this knowledge telepathically. An interlocuter asking questions that they do not know the answer to may present a possible way to distinguish a disguised POI-2013 from actual Foundation employees.

&gt; If possible, KTE-7842-Yellow-Lerna should be detained and handed over to the British Occult Service rather than terminated. Physically, KTE-7842-Yellow-Lerna poses minimal threat to a trained operative. Once identified by EVE scanning or psychic surveillance, KTE-7842-Yellow-Lerna must be detained and not released under any circumstances, regardless of assumed appearance or any claims to be working for the GOC or an allied organisation.

[[tab Contribute]] 

While the series has so far only been written by [[*user Jerden]], it&#39;s only been possible with the help of critics, collaborators and authors of prior works, and I think the characters and themes of the series are something other people could explore as well. The plan is for it to weave serpentine though other canons and settings, taking a maximally inclusive approach to other works while simultaneously showing no respect for the status quo.

If you&#39;d like to use the characters I&#39;ve written, as a brief cameo or as the focus of the work, feel free.  If it doesn&#39;t irreconcilably contradict stuff I&#39;ve already written or intend to write in future, I&#39;ll consider it canon and add it to The Library - the timeline&#39;s loose for a reason. I&#39;m very happy to provide advice, I have plenty of ideas that I lack the time or personal familiarity with to write down. 

Any work that explores similar themes (The Serpent&#39;s Hand opposing the status quo) could also be part of the series, even if it uses a completely different cast of characters. I&#39;d describe the genre I&#39;m going for as character-driven action, but it&#39;s equally important to explore motivations and character interactions, so there&#39;s plenty of space for more reflective or conversational entries. 

This is a much more ruthless take on the Serpent&#39;s Hand than you see in most tales, the key thing to remember is that they still see themselves as the heroes. It&#39;s not that the end justifies the means, that&#39;s the ideology of the Jailors and Bookburners. A righteous cause requires no further justification.

I lack the artistic talent to actually draw these characters, which I think is a shame. If anyone does decide to create artwork depicting any of the cast or scenes from the series, I will (with the artist&#39;s permission) put it up on the hub, either in The Cast section or in a separate tab of its own. 

With that said, I have no expectation anyone else will want to contribute - if this just ends up being me, I&#39;ll be happy just to tell the stories I want to tell!
