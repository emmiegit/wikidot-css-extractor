**Special Containment Procedures:** As there is currently no known method to contain SCP-5961, all containment efforts are to center around the perimeter of all existing SCP-5961-A instances. To execute this task, Cover Story G.96 (&#34;Endangered Environment&#34;) is to be applied to all viewings of containment sites.

**Description:** SCP-5961 refers to a phenomenon occurring worldwide, consisting of a series of events and the creation of SCP-5961-A. Haphazardly, SCP-5961 will occur within bodies of water at least 500 metres deep, mostly consisting of several phases irregularly:

* **Phase 1:** All water within a 200-metre radius of the SCP-5961 event will begin forming a whirlpool and pulling all objects inside the perimeter. This process is progressive, speeding up as time proceeds.

* **Phase 2:** Water affected by SCP-5961 will begin concentrating and pulling onto a single point, before exploding upwards. Depending on the depth wherein the SCP-5961 event is taking place, the water will reach higher or lower distances on the surface.

* **Phase 3:** All objects ejected onto the surface will begin levitating for up to two hours before being attracted into the Earth twice as fast since they were ejected into the air. Along with this, an SCP-5961-A instance will be developed.

SCP-5961-A is the collective designation given to all areas that are subjected to an SCP-5961 event. Following the conversion of a perimeter into an SCP-5961-A instance, all objects entering the area will subsequently transform into instances of Valentin&#39;s sharpnose puffers, also known as //Canthigaster valentini// or saddled puffers.[[footnote]]A species of pufferfish distributed along tropical spaces.[[/footnote]]

Notably, these species are buoyant and resistant to hydrostatic pressure.

SCP-5961 was discovered during the loss of the SCPB Rinta, a Foundation vessel employed for the exploration of Site-72&#39;s surroundings and the Mariana Trench. On the prior hours, Drs. Avery Cado and Samantha Abbett were using the craft to identify an unknown anomaly that appeared near Deep Sea Site-72.

However, in the middle of the exploration, the SCPB Rinta became the subject of an SCP-5961 event before being ejected upwards. This led to the impact of the anomaly on the coast of Mindanao Island after two hours of levitation, reaching heights of 2.4 kilometres above the ground. Moreover, the SCP-5961-A instance created as a result of this event was not discovered.

Since this incident, several SCP-5961 events were recorded worldwide, with its assigned facility being Deep Sea Site-72. The following includes a series of notable incidents caused by SCP-5961:

||~ Date ||~ Location ||~ Event ||
|| 29/09/1990 || Barkly, Australia || Foundation satellites located a massive cloud of several substances over the skies of Barkly. Initially believed to be a mass of gases generated by nearby factories, it was revealed that approximately 110.000 fish of different species such as mullet, carp and mackerels composed this mass. Following the downfall of the fish over the territory, several masses were seen falling over the water prior to entering an SCP-5961-A instance. All vessels within the zone were later evacuated to avoid poisoning by pufferfish. Cover Story G.18 (&#34;Tornado&#34;) was implanted in nearby municipalities. ||
|| 30/11/1992 || [[[The Fishing Council|Nova Scotia, Canada]]] || After multiple eyewitness reports of whales and rocks falling over the coasts of Nova Scotia, Foundation satellites located a large mass of levitating whales over Nova Scotia&#39;s skies. The event had occurred over the Northumberland Strait and lifted multiple species of aquatic birds, insects and vertebrae. The birds within the flock of whales created a sound that alarmed most civilians, although the local population was quickly administered amnestics as the wildlife fell into SCP-5961-A, becoming pufferfish.||
|| 20/01/1994 || Irkutsk, Russia || An SCP-5961 event occurred within Baikal Lake, causing various objects such as fish, rocks, relics and other buried materials to be ejected over the skies. After levitating over the lake for four hours, the mass began falling towards the Earth, injuring a large amount of fauna and flora within the Lake&#39;s surroundings as it caused a small forest fire. Cover Story G.32 (&#34;Asteroid&#34;) was deployed in the surrounding areas. Due to the thickness of the ice over the lake, no pufferfish were seen nearby. The SCP-5961-A instance was also discovered.||
|| 16/07/1995 || New Orleans, United States|| Reports of a nuclear bomb falling over the streets of New Orleans brought up the theory that the United States of America was under attack of North Korean and Russian missiles, even if no emergency warning was issued. However, it was revealed that the falling object was rather an abandoned Russian submarine. Cover Story G.18 (&#34;Tornado&#34;) was implanted. Three people were hurt upon impact. ||
|| 23/05/1997 || Cape Town, South Africa || While no records of SCP-5961 occurred within the area, a large instance of //Canthigaster valentini//[[footnote]]Approximately 40 meters high.[[/footnote]] appeared on the beaches of Cape Town, vomiting pufferfish. It was later deemed as the result of a vessel entering an SCP-5961-A instance, and Cover Story G.67 (&#34;Movie Cast&#34;) was implanted among the people. ||
|| 27/11/1998 || Mariana Trench, Pacific Ocean || See below (Addendum 5691.2: Incident Log) ||

[[collapsible show=&#34;Incident Log&#34; hide=&#34;Incident Log&#34;]]

On November 27th, 1998, a joint investigation led by both the SCP Foundation and the Global Occult Coalition was started in order to research an Ekhi-Class anomaly that was roaming the depths of the Mariana Trench. When the assigned bathyscaphe, the //SCP/GOC-B Toi//, reached approximately 4.8 kilometres of depth, an SCP-5961 event occurred.

As the water began swirling, the nearby environment began submitting itself to the anomaly&#39;s effects regardless of status or nature. //The SCP/GOC-B Toi// was also affected during this period, leading it to be ejected upwards at extremely fast speeds. The water was later revealed to reach space, creating several seaquakes that reached the coasts of the Philippines, China and Japan while not reaching Deep Sea Site-72.

The following log depicts the events as recorded by Foundation and GOC agents Carbon and Jerden within the //SCP/GOC-B Toi//, which also reached the limits of the Thermosphere:

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
= **[BEGIN LOG]**

**Z-72 Carbon:** Wuh?

(//The agents begin looking onto the chamber&#39;s floor as it begins shaking.//)

**S-51 Jerden:** Command, command. Do you copy?

**Command:** Roger that, Jerden. Copy.

**S-51 Jerden:** The vessel is shaking, command. Repeat. The vessel is shaking.

**Command:** Wait, what?

**Z-72 Carbon:** It&#39;s not shaking; it&#39;s spinning!

(//The agents stumble to the floor as the SCP/GOC-B Toi begins elevating. Z-72 Carbon begins panicking, while S-51 Jerden tries to contact command.//)

**S-51 Jerden:** FUCK!

**Z-72 Carbon:** What&#39;s happening?

**S-51 Jerden:** Hell if I know!

(//Z-72 Carbon begins crawling towards her seat, trying to reach her security belt. S-51 Jerden does the same.//)

**Command:** Carbon? Jerden? Do you copy?

**S-51 Jerden:** Yeah. What&#39;s going on? Are we pulling up, or..?

**Command:** No. There&#39;s something g-

(//The signal cuts.//)

**Z-72 Carbon:** Oh shit.

(//The ship&#39;s sonar begins recording Deep Sea Site-72, as Z-72 Carbon reaches for an oxygen mask on the roof of the vessel.//)

**Z-72 Carbon:** When the fuck did we put on so much gas?

**S-51 Jerden:** I don&#39;t know!

(//The signal comes back intermittently.//)

**Command:** Why is the- [STATIC] -ter pillar o- [STATIC] -trench?

**S-51 Jerden:** What was that?

**Command:** Why is there a water pillar on top of the trench? OH GOD, IT&#39;S COM-

(//The signal cuts once again.//)

**Z-72 Carbon:** Oh god.

(//The cameras stop recording, although signals can be sent through the agents&#39; microphones.//)

**S-51 Jerden:** I can&#39;t hear anything outside except water.

**Z-72 Carbon:** I mean, yeah, it&#39;s-

**Z-72 Carbon:** Oh, look, camera&#39;s broken.

(//The vessel stops moving, completely suspended mid-air.//)

**S-51 Jerden:** Wait. Wh-

**Z-72 Carbon:** Shit, we&#39;re in a buoy now.

**S-51 Jerden:** What? What do you mean?

(//Z-72 Carbon shrugs.//)

**Z-72 Carbon:** We&#39;re in space.

**S-51 Jerden:** You&#39;re saying the fucking vessel is...

**Z-72 Carbon:** Yes.

(//The vessel begins moving towards the Earth once again.//)

**Z-72 Carbon:** The vessel is buoyant. And sometimes, some things in life simply float.

(//Silence. Carbon looks around the chamber before shrugging.//)

**Z-72 Carbon:** Then why not let us emerge?

(//The microphones cut as the vessel falls.//)

While the object was recorded reaching 55 kilometres of height, the impact was recorded on the Mariana Trench, causing the second round of seaquakes. All video recordings of the SCP-5961 event taking place were cut out and all information regarding the anomaly was expunged on social media.

The aftermath of the event resulted in several consequences, such as 1.259 casualties and 3.467 injured people. As a result, Foundation personnel disseminated along the media the fact that this was, indeed, caused by Cover Story G.54 (&#34;Tsunami/Seaquake&#34;). Due to Deep Sea Site-72&#39;s status as an underwater site, the SCP-5961 caused minor damages within the facility.

The //SCP/GOC-B Toi// was reported missing. Instead, reports of a large pufferfish and two small blowfishes were brought up near Deep Sea Site-72.

A few minutes prior to the impact, the agents&#39; cameras began recording once again. As the camera became blurry, the anomaly began recording the //SCP/GOC-B Toi//&#39;s transformation into a large pufferfish, as Carbon and Jerden tried to leave the capsule. Instead of being crushed by the hydrostatic pressure, though, both agents became pufferfish.

The following are agent Jerden&#39;s last words prior to his disappearance:

&gt; what is going on

&gt; why is [illegible] a bubble

&gt; why am i a pufferfish

&gt; oh

&gt; blurp

&gt; beware the buoyancy
