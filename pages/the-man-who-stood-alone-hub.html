Colonel Hollender,

Yesterday, January 4th, 1990, an atrocious crime was committed against the SCP Foundation. A day that will live in history forever. We were deliberately attacked, without reason or warning by the Clear Skies Initiative, resulting in the barbarous murder of hundreds of Foundation employees in broad daylight. For decades, the Clear Skies Initiative has been an inconsequential thorn in our side, but this recent development has pushed us too far. 

As a result of this bestial act of aggression against innocent human life, we will be taking every measure to ensure we are able to protect our future from this belligerent threat. We are in grave danger, Colonel Hollender, there is no doubt about that. I believe that I interpret the feelings of the entire Foundation when I take direct action to ensure that this form of antagonistic, mindless aggression will never happen again.

As of now, your task force will be stationed full-time in the Eurasian supercontinent where the Clear Skies Initiative have the strongest grasp. I trust that together, we can eliminate this scourge from the world.

-The Ninth Overseer
//,,Department of Pursuit and Suppression,,//

[[size 140%]]T[[/size]]he Foundation is under grave threat. Hostile Groups of Interest are slowly closing in around them and claiming territory, paying off informants to burrow deep into the Foundation&#39;s secrets. The world is slowly becoming //their// world and not //our// world. As the Foundation slips out of the spotlight, other groups rise to fill the power vacuum, leaving large swaths of destruction in their wake. Corruption runs rampant in all levels of authority and the Foundation starts to turn on itself.

Agent Hollender is tasked with addressing the latest threat to the Foundation, the Clear Skies Initiative.

The Clear Skies Initiative aims to destroy the anomalies in our midst and return the world to complete normalcy through any means necessary.

&gt; G&#39;day,
&gt; 
&gt; Over the past couple months I have commissioned my friend for several pieces of artwork.

Should be done in the next week and a half based on how long I wait for feedback on it, so stay tuned. I&#39;ve also decided to write an ORIGINS section, for writing some backstory of the characters before their time at the Foundation just because I wanted to explore some non-SCP related content. Hope you have a swell rest of your day.

__**Name:**__ Charles Benedict Hollender

__**Security Clearance:**__ 4

__**Current Station:**__ UKSHAC, Protected Garrison Area-10, Scottish Highlands

Hollender along with Lieutenant Colonel Micah Jennings Adler were the only survivors. Following an interview by Foundation field agents, it was determined that they would operate well within the Mobile Task Force branch of the Foundation.

__**Name:**__ Riley &#34;Roach&#34; Dallas

__**Birthdate:**__ November 2nd, 1959

__**Rank and Position:**__ Staff Sergeant, Marksman, MTF Titan-1 -- Squad Disciple-2-2

__**Security Clearance:**__ 2

__**Current Station:**__ UKSHAC, Protected Garrison Area-10, Scottish Highlands


__**Background:**__ Staff Sergeant Riley Dallas was a field agent in the United States Delta Force’s B Squadron and was recruited to the Foundation in 1983 after distinguishing himself in the Invasion of Grenada.

Not much is known about Dallas&#39; time in Delta Force, besides working with the acclaimed Shiva Team who eliminated many high-value targets during the Cold War and often being deployed alone for reconnaissance missions. He has also been noted to speak several languages to near perfection, including Kurdish, Polish, and Russian. 

Dallas&#39; nickname comes from an operation in the 1970s involving an R-36M (SS-18 Satan) missile launch, where he rescued a squad of Delta Force operatives that were pinned by hostile Russian forces, earning the Medal of Honour.
