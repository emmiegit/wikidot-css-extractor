Once SCP-6113-3 reaches the age of 18 in 2025, preparations are to be made for her amnesticization and release in accordance with the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4395 Reintegration Committee].

[[span style=&#34;color:blue;&#34;]]By order of the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4175 Ethics Subcommittee for Humanoid Entities][[footnote]]See Addendum 6113-3.17: Ethics Committee Injunction[[/footnote]], Dr. James Park&#39;s contract with the Foundation is terminated and, upon his return[[footnote]]See Addendum 6113-3.18: Incident Log 6113-3 06/11/2019.[[/footnote]], prohibited from any and all contact with SCP-6113-3 and the SCP-6113 project.

**Official Ethics Committee Injunction**

**Date:** 06/11/2019
**To:** Dr. James Park
**From:** Ethics Committee Liaison Jeremiah Cimmerian
**Cc:** Dr. Brandon Fisher
**Subject:** SCP-6113-3
-----
Dr. Park,

The development of the SCP-6113 project has piqued the interest of this committee as of late. With SCP-6113-3&#39;s unique containment situation, one should take care when acquiring information from her as to not cross the boundary between object and researcher. While your methods have no doubt proved effective in the containment of SCP-6113, it is of this committee&#39;s opinion that you have acted unethically in growing too comfortable with SCP-6113-3. Your continued disregard for the ethical integrity of your position has forced us to take disciplinary action out of an abundance of caution.

Effective immediately, you are removed from the SCP-6113 project and demoted to Level 2 Assistant Researcher. You are to be transferred to Site-06-3 immediately. You are also barred from any and all contact with SCP-6113-3. If found in violation of this injunction, your contract with the Foundation is to be terminated and you will be amnesticized. SCP-6113 Assistant Researcher Dr. Brandon Fisher is promoted to the position of SCP-6113 Senior Researcher.

- Ethics Committee Liaison Jeremiah Cimmerian

**Addendum 6113-3.18:** Incident 6113-3 06/11/2019

On 06/11/2019, at 11:42 AM, two guards arrived at Dr. James Park&#39;s office to escort him off the premises. Dr. Park had, presumably, already read the injunction at this point. The office door, however, was locked and the blinds closed.

As they attempted to negotiate with Dr. Park, they reportedly heard crying and sounds of emotional distress inside his office. Additional security personnel were summoned, and preparations were made in the event Dr. Park turned violent. Dr. Park was non-cooperative with orders to open the door. Threats of termination were met with silence. Security personnel were ordered to forcibly enter his office. Upon entrance, Dr. Park was not found inside his office. Notably, the only exit from his office is through the door that was breached. Dr. Park&#39;s personal effects were left intact, and his computer terminal was left logged in. There was no sign of a struggle. Seen below is the email his terminal was open to.

Site-17 was not put on lockdown, however, all security personnel were ordered to search for and detain Dr. Park immediately. After approximately four hours, at 4:45 PM, the order was lifted. Search efforts for Dr. Park was initiated for all Foundation agents and applicable Mobile Task Forces within a 100 km radius. As of writing, Dr. Park has not been found.
