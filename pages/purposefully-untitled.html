God, there&#39;s nothing I can write.
Words are as thick as molasses, 
Dribbling out my skull onto the keyboard.
There&#39;s no meter, no metaphor, not even a facsimile of meaning. 

I&#39;m trying to build a cathedral with a shovel.
I&#39;m performing a surgery with a brick, 
Pummeling the page until neither of us can recognize the other. 
Why am I doing this again? 

The world is behind a fishbowl. 
Or am I inside the fishbowl staring out? 
Whatever it is, I can&#39;t see it. 
I can&#39;t tell if that taste is the tears or the saltwater in my cup. 
I used to have a goldfish.

The world is too cold, but God am I burning. 
The world is burning, yet there&#39;s snow in Ohio. 
Or is it Texas? Fuck it. 
This isn&#39;t the time for commentary. 
When did my head start to swim? 
Why am I so stuck on fish? 

My head feels like a smoked out hive and the workers are dancing in my stomach. 
What does that even mean?
I remember running away from a swarm, 
It felt just like this. 

My skull is sizzling, 
Like a fish frying in a pan. 
Inspiration pops like bacon grease, 
scalding me before it&#39;s lost, 
like Icarus to the seas. 

I&#39;m alone on an island.
I&#39;m screaming in a walk-in freezer. 
I&#39;m pouring myself another cup of coffee. 
God, there&#39;s nothing I can write.</textarea></pre>
