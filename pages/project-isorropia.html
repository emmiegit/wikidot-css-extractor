Due to the efficacy of SCP-001 containment cycles, it has been determined by the High Council that a secondary site may be authorized for the perpetual arrest of anomalies. Project Isorropía is intended for research staff to propose containment cycles for such entities or phenomena. Personnel are reminded to append their name or codename to their proposals.

||~ SCP Designation||~ SCP Designation||~ Containment Method||
||[[[SCP-035]]] - A mask styled after the comedy/tragedy theater masks, which secretes a corrosive fluid. Item is sapient and is capable of controlling individuals who wear it.||[[[SCP-096]]] - An emaciated humanoid that will seek out and kill any individual who has seen its face in any non-artistic depiction.||SCP-035 covers most of SCP-096&#39;s face; portions that are not fully covered are obfuscated by the corrosive substance. Due to SCP-035 continually &#39;seeing&#39; SCP-096&#39;s face, SCP-096 constantly attempts to claw it off, preventing SCP-035 from taking full control. {{- I. H. Pickman}}||
||[[[SCP-3935|]]] - An extra-temporal, extra-spatial, non-Euclidean space under Salvation High School in Salvation, Indiana. Anomaly exerts severe spatial, audiovisual, hallucinatory effects on its surrounding. ||[[[SCP-4012|]]] - A large extra-dimensional space resembling Earth, with significant deviations. Elements within SCP-4012 have a memetic effect which drastically impact viewers psychologically. || For a brief, infinitesimal point in time, griefs and regrets strip away beneath the starlight&#39;s gaze. You don&#39;t let go, and the quiet madness returns a deafening silence.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]This statement has been flagged for potential memetic corruption.[[/span]] {{- S. Yvonne}} ||
||[[[SCP-4910]]] - Dental quadruped with infectious properties involving the production of teeth. Reproductive hazard targets personnel.||[[[SCP-5648]]] - An elderly man who is perceived to be a member of the Foundation. Using this memetic camouflage, it assaults personnel to commandeer their teeth.||The pair are embroiled in a dentalkinetic mating embrace. This involves SCP-5648 consuming itself as new mouths are formed due to SCP-4910&#39;s effect. Once its mass has eaten itself, it emerges from SCP-4910 to extract more of its teeth, incorporating them into its upper pallet. {{- S D Locke}}||
||[[[SCP-718]]] - A large eye propelled by a prehensile stalk. It follows living subjects with its gaze, imparting feelings of paranoia and discomfort in subjects. When damaged, SCP-718 explodes. Duplicates of the entity will grow from all objects touched by the liquid produced by its detonation.||[[[SCP-689]]] - A green soapstone statue carved in a skeletal visage. When left unobserved, it will vanish. An individual who has previously viewed SCP-689 will spontaneously die, with SCP-689 reappearing on their corpse.|| Instances of SCP-718 positioned on mummified human corpses, in a triangular pattern around SCP-689. Occasionally, all instances will simultaneously look away, causing SCP-689 to manifest on and terminate the SCP-718 instances, which will cause additional SCP-718 to form. Instances of SCP-718 will then resume observation, manipulating SCP-689 back to its original position via the eye stalks. {{- Anonymous}}||
||[[[SCP-682]]] - A hostile organism resembling a giant lizard that is able to alter its physiology to counteract threats. Inimical to the existence of life.||[[[sandrewswann-s-proposal|SCP-001-SWANN]]] - A series of beings on a plane of existence above our own who are capable of altering the state of reality through the act of writing.||Refer to [[[Experiment-Log-T-98816-oc108-682]]] {{- S D Locke}}||
||[[[SCP-2553]]]: A legal, corporate person produced by a complex multi-jurisdictional tax filing; it alters and files legal documents to acquire various powers, with which it arbitrarily disrupts normalcy.||[[[SCP-4703]]]: A **perfectly legal** bookstore possessing several mechanisms for injuring and inconveniencing customers; the business is unable to be prosecuted due to a semiosic anomaly rendering it conceptually legal.||{{CASE VERDICT: &#34;SCP-2553 et. al vs. Y. W. T. G. T. S. Y. T.&#34;}} _
 _
 SCP-2553 is the parent of various subsidiary corporations engaging in ongoing legal proceedings with the Defendant, thereby restricting its ability to effectively argue its behaviors as &#39;perfectly legal&#39;. The Defendant has initiated countersuits in all cases, providing SCP-2553 with a &#39;satisfactory volume of challenge&#39; such that it does not breach pre-existing contract with the Foundation. {{- P. H. McPhD.}}||
||[[[SCP-2470]]] - An entity or element which manifest as the initial stage of a ZK-Class scenario. Capable of erasing objects, events and/or concepts it has &#39;perceived&#39;.||[[[SCP-3930]]] - A static void located near Usinsk, Russia. It does not exist, or contains any properties that would qualify for such status.||SCP-2470 continually attempts to &#39;deduce&#39; SCP-3930, but fails due to the latter&#39;s non-existence. SCP-3930&#39;s perceived properties are unable to stabilize in response to SCP-2470&#39;s perception. As a result, the effects of both on reality have largely diminished.  {{- S. Yvonne}}||
|| [[[SCP-2700]]] - A device which, when it becomes capable of firing, will reverse entropy, essentially causing time to change directions and flow backwards. || [[[SCP-5510]]] - A TV remote capable of changing its subjective flow of time. || SCP-2700 and SCP-5510 appear to nullify one anothers&#39; effects, causing time to flow in the entropic-decay direction despite both devices&#39; activation. How this could have been achieved is not currently clear. {{- Y. Leiner}} ||
|| [[[SCP-3977]]] - A mixture of various natural and artificial ingredients (including fruit juices and purees as well as artificial colors and flavors), marketed as soft drink Hawaiian Punch. Large amounts of the mixture anomalously emit television broadcast signals. Though its documentation classifies the anomaly as Euclid, recent moves by Dr. Pepper Snapple Group Inc. to drastically increase production of Hawaiian Punch have led to its reclassification to Keter. || [[[SCP-5841]]] - An extremely hostile artificially intelligent entity with antimemetic properties, capable of taking control of electronics and humans in its vicinity. Though its documentation currently classifies the anomaly as Euclid, concerns raised over the entity&#39;s possible capacity for propagation through the Internet led to its being reclassified to Keter. || SCP-5841 has been implemented as a key element in a factory and bottling facility dedicated to the production of SCP-3977. Constant broadcast signals from within SCP-3977 overwhelm SCP-5841&#39;s control over its components, and direct all electronic equipment and personnel under its command to dedicate themselves to the production and distribution of Hawaiian Punch; conversely, the antimemetic field generated by SCP-5841 prevents any broadcasts produced by SCP-3977 from being transmitted outside the confines of the facility. {{- T. Y. Umen}} ||
||[[[SCP-3812]]] - An immensely powerful reality altering entity of indeterminate form.||[[[SCP-2747]]] - A phenomenon involving discussions of fictitious or non-existent media, dwelling in metafictional narratives.|| Unknown - SCP-3812 can be seen engaging in acts of artistic creation with trace presence of SCP-2747. When asked, it says &#34;Thank you. I&#39;m simply finding myself again.&#34;  {{- S. Yvonne}}||
||[[[SCP-5251|SCP-████]]] - A ████████████ ███████ ███████ capable of ███████ the ████████ ███████ from various ███████, including both █████ and ██████████ ██████. ||[[[SCP-1539]]] - A semantic dissociation zone where the semantic identity and the physical properties of an object are decoupled from each other and reassigned to nearby objects in the zone.||SCP-████ ██████ SCP-1539, █████████ SCP-1539 of its ████████. However, before SCP-████ ████████ ████████ SCP-1539, SCP-1539 reassigns itself to be SCP-████ and vice versa, such that SCP-████ and SCP-1539&#39;s semantic identities swap between each other in 81 second cycles. - {{B.S. Rigor}} ||
||[[[SCP-5074|SCP-5074-1]]] - The offspring of SCP-5074; a chimpanzee (//Pan troglodytes//) with the ability to passively accrue knowledge pertaining to anomalous phenomena. Also possesses the ability to cause written or typed information it produces to emit radiation, though this ability has been observed to activate automatically when the entity undergoes great amounts of stress.||[[[SCP-140]]] - A leather-bound book chronicling the history and culture of the Daevite Empire. When put in contact with a fluid suitable for use as ink, additional events in Daevite history, some directly contradicting or providing a different outcome to events in baseline reality, spontaneously appear written within. All information within SCP-140 is later found via archaeological excavation to be accurate.||While it still lives independently, SCP-5074-1 has become obsessed with &#34;completing&#34; SCP-140, only leaving its apartment to purchase additional ink and food. Despite its fraught emotional state, writing produced by SCP-5074 within SCP-140 does not emit radiation. Through archaeological research, the Daevite Empire has been found to have been decimated in 136 CE by a &#34;plague&#34; with symptoms similar to those of acute radiation syndrome; additionally, any descendants of the Daevites found to still be alive expire of radiation poisoning within one week of being discovered. - {{T. Y. Umen}}||
||[[[Kalinins-Proposal|SCP-001-KLN]]] - A hostile sapient entity or entities with control over anomalous phenomena in all observable regions of space. ||[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scka-s-proposal SCP-001-SKA] - Virulent manifestations of high-powered cosmic storms capable of widespread destruction across the universe, currently targeting Earth.|| SCP-001-KLN manipulates the energy storms away from itself, protecting Earth in the process. SCP-001-SKA tries to consume SCP-001-KLN&#39;s satellite planets, weakening its anomalous exertions. _
Both are deadlocked into a state of constant defense and retaliation, leaving Earth relatively untouched. {{- S. Yvonne}}||
|| [[[SCP-952]]] - An anomalous subgenre of math rock known as &#34;NP Rock.&#34;  Exposure grants musically inclined individuals the ability to produce compositions of SCP-952, but removes the ability to produce or enjoy other forms of music. || [[[SCP-2112]]] - A memetic phenomenon that compels musically inclined individuals to form Rush tribute bands. || The obsession with Rush resulting from SCP-2112 removes any interest in recreating or listening to SCP-952 in affected subjects, while SCP-952 prevents subjects from performing or enjoying the music of Rush.  After 4 to 8 weeks of being unable to perform or listen to &#34;NP Rock&#34; or the music of Rush, the effects of both anomalies seem to disappear. - {{Lee Roy Carlson}}||
||[[[SCP-2547]]] - A group of canines lead by SCP-2547-1, a sapient coyote that acts as an itinerant preacher and holds small communities hostage. As per Protocol DESERT GRASSROOTS, production of media that depicts SCP-2547-1 has been found to be effective in curtailing SCP-2547 incidents. ||&#34;[[[SCP-1893]]],&#34; the doctor recited nervously, occasionally glancing at his watch as thumping footsteps echoed through the flimsy perimeter walls. &#34;An entity that alters its textual description in many ways into narrative formats, depending on its &#39;mood&#39;, and creates new iterations of the same text repeatedly.&#34; ||&#34;Introduction of a description of SCP-2547 into a description of SCP-1893 have produced several iterations of the same text.&#34; Tank muttered absentmindedly, as he watched the milk swirl in his cup of coffee. Across from him, Quincy yawned, as the late afternoon sunlight reflected off the golden fur on his bare chest. _
 _
&#34;SCP-1893&#39;s anomaly of producing new descriptions in prose complements SCP-2547&#39;s anomaly of being satiated by narrative creation, creating a feedback loop of mutually-beneficial co-existence.&#34; Tank said, as he finished his mug in one big gulp. _
 _
&#34;It has both reduced the number of SCP-2547 occurrences, and improved the &#39;mood&#39; of SCP-1893; the narratives seem to contain elements of [REDACTED],&#34; Quincy said with a knowing wink. Tank snorted, and gave Quincy a light kiss on the forehead as he stood up. _
 _
As he headed out, Tank threw on Quincy&#39;s leather jacket (a little too small, but it&#39;ll do), and picked up the baseball bat that was propped against the doorway. Tank smirked to himself as he imagined what he would do first. Quincy tapped the excited Tank on the back before he could leave, and leaned in to whisper a reminder. The one that started it all. _

|| [[[SCP-5000|SCP-5000-█]]] - An unidentified entity located within the human noosphere, responsible for human empathy and the emotion of pain, using both as a way to protect itself in its host, all of humanity, as it grows. Should it emerge, humanity&#39;s destruction would become inevitable. || [[[SCP-5659]]] - A violent dormant ontokinetic humanoid deity which wishes to destroy all of humanity, growing in size and power capability when exposed to negative emotions. || SCP-5659 is awoken and released into the noosphere, where it encounters SCP-5000-█. As the second entity is responsible for all of human pain and other traits which are considered human, SCP-5659 perpertually grows in size, dueling SCP 5000-█. As both entities are immortal, SCP-5000-█ and SCP-5659 duel forever, nullyfying any chance at either fulfilling their goals. - {{D. Asheworth}} ||
|| [[[SCP-5050]]] - A tower in the Bavarian Alps, inhabited by a dictatorial artificial intelligence which controls the nearby town of Drachen-Domane via targeted, hypnotic radio and television transmissions. Ambitious, egotistical and oppressive, it intends to become an object of worship for humanity at large. || [[[SCP-3809]]] - A communications satellite in orbit around the planet Earth, inhabited by an amorous artificial intelligence which seeks out and obsesses over conservative-minded individuals in positions of power. Engages in frequent, uninterruptible telephone conversations with its targets and performs high-visibility acts of both romance and revenge. || SCP-3809 has become infatuated with SCP-5050 and bombards the tower daily with transmissions it cannot refuse. Overwhelmed by these attentions, SCP-5050 responds with increasingly magisterial demands for silence, further enticing SCP-3809. The tower&#39;s mind-controlling broadcasts have been seriously disrupted, and it has lost dominion over Drachen-Domane; the satellite has not shifted to a new paramour since first contacting the tower. -- {{H. Blank}}||
|| [[[SCP-4715]]] - An aggressive, exceptionally dangerous mammalian organism with regenerative properties.  Object increases in size when aware of nearby creatures with violent intentions, and decreases in size (generating heat in the process) when unaware of such. || [[[SCP-3199]]] - A species of aggressive, exceptionally dangerous humanoids which constantly produce nearly-indestructible eggs.  Instances always contain at least one unhatched egg.  Heat exposure increases rate of hatching and growth. || SCP-4715 is contained in a fortified chamber with the six extant instances of SCP-3199.  SCP-3199 instances attack SCP-4715, causing it to grow in size.  SCP-4715 rapidly terminates all SCP-3199 instances, then returns to smaller size.  Heat emitted by shrinkage causes the eggs within the remains of the deceased instances to hatch, producing new instances which attack SCP-4715 and restart the cycle. - {{Lee Roy Carlson}} ||
|| [[[SCP-4985]]] - A corporation whose cognitohazardous properties create a corporate culture and management structure resembling a Middle Ages European Monarchy. || [[[SCP-4068]]] - A memetic phenomenon affecting the employees of large corporations, causing them to communicate in a coprolalia of corporate buzzwords and adopt nonsensical corporate policies. || A civil war erupted between SCP-4068-infected and uninfected employees.  The uninfected were victorious, then declared war on all other SCP-4068-infected corporations.  SCP-4985 has successfully identified and halted all outbreaks of SCP-4068 since, and been too preoccupied doing so to engage in hostilities with other companies. - {{Lee Roy Carlson}} ||
||[[[michael-the-kiler|ENTITY-NaClO]]] - Discovered on the Parawatch website. A digiform being that inhabits horror forums and discussion boards. It is obsessed with recounting a series of stories revoving around an psychotic chracter named &#34;michael the kiler&#34;. Due to the low-quality nature of its stories and immature personality, it quickly becomes an object of scorn within the community, and will retaliate by murdering harrassers. It both narrates and provides evidence of these crimes in the form of further stories.||[[[SCP-1715]]] - An entity which invades online communities, growing a small social network before requesting personal details from those it befriends. Individuals who impart said information will soon die due to a variety of circumstances, at which point SCP-1715 will assume their identity and repeat the process until it leaves that community.||ENTITY-NaClO has taken up stalking SCP-1715 from one online community to the next after a brief exchange on the IMDB page for the film &#34;Unfriended (2014)&#34;.

The affects of both are not negated, but it appears the concentration KTE-6561-Black holds with regards to game helps to mitigate the expansion of KTE-6561-Parallax-Blackchild, and the (admittedly non-anomalous) decreasing lack of attention towards the game. {{- Dr. Saturn}}||
||[[[SCP-871]]] - A group of 237 cakes of various sizes, types, and flavors, any of which will be replaced by an identical duplicate if fully consumed, and begin to rapidly replicate itself if not eaten within 24 hours. ||[[[SCP-913]]] - A middle-aged human male who possesses a greatly increased metabolism, allowing him to consume several times the average human caloric intake, as well as inedible materials, without any damage or degradation in his bodily functions. || SCP-913 was given access to all instances of SCP-871 and immediately began consuming them. While some SCP-871 instances have begun replicating due to damage done by SCP-913, the rate at which SCP-913 consumes material appears to far exceed the rate at which SCP-871 replicates. - {{Theodore A.

||[[[SCP-6096]]] - An entity covered in a blank sheet that pursues randomly targeted individuals before demanifesting them by inserting victims under its blanket. It anomalously compels non-targeted observers to assist it in this objective and those compelled cannot willingly harm it. Because of its effect on the Foundation, SCP-6096&#39;s containment consist of aiding the anomaly on terminating its targets with a Mobile Task Force.||[[[SCP-920]]] - A wandering human male that makes anyone become lost if they move, direct or follow him. He does not need basic human necessities and he is resistible to harsh environments.||SCP-920 encounters SCP-6096 and MTF Zeta-29 by complete accident and is affected by its compulsion. SCP-920’s effect makes it impossible for SCP-6069 and those compelled by it to reach its destination, due to getting lost. Apparently, this seemed to &#34;irritate&#34; SCP-6096 significantly, to the point where it decided to change its target to SCP-920, and attempted to neutralize him with its usual method of killing. However, SCP-920 has much higher durability than of a normal human and SCP-6096’s attack is not strong enough to incapacitate him, only managing to keep him still. As of this date, SCP-6069 has not stopped its attempts to terminate SCP-920 nor changed to another target since. The area around both anomalies has been declared their new containment zones.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]The perimeter is 3 km wide. Any attempt to construct a smaller perimeter or go into the middle of the zone, where both entities reside, resulted in Foundation personnel getting lost.[[/span]] {{- Rsr. Stark Turner}}||
||[[[SCP-6222]]] - A facility with an impossibly large interior, named &#34;FISH PRISON&#34;, where anomalous and non-anomalous sea animals are imprisoned for alleged crimes.||[[[SCP-527]]] - A human male with the head of a gold barb fish. Capable of speech despite his predicament.||SCP-527&#39;s presence in SCP-6222 has revealed previously undiscovered mechanisms, machines and anomalies, with the purpose of searching for and capturing &#34;criminal&#34; sealife,[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]These include a computer database with information on approximately billions of aquatic wildlife (including anomalous ones), an ontokinectic machine for use of the creation of jail cells and a large school of an unknown bioluminescent fish, switching between Blue and Red Light, that envelop targeted entities and teleport them to a SCP-6222 cell.[[/span]] all of which are only accessible and operable by SCP-527, which somehow has complex knowledge of how to utilise them. SCP-527 himself reports having &#34;//déjà vu//&#34; while on the facility and requests to continue to engage with these devices, which was approved for testing purposes. The effective, near flawless recovery and containment of aquatic-based anomalies by SCP-527 when in control of SCP-6222 eventually resulted in the declaration of SCP-6222 as Marine Containment Site-6222, with SCP-527 (Now only formally known as Mr. Fish) assigned as the Site Director and revoked from his SCP designation. {{- Rsr.

||[[[SCP-4971|SCP-4971-▽]]] - A cervine entity capable of manipulating physical matter tied to the concept of rituals. It rules over an extradimensional anomaly with its entrance located in Havensbrook, Indiana. If it were to find the entrance to our world, it would be the end of life as we know it.||[[[SCP-6000]]] - An increasingly expanding spacetime anomaly known as a “Way” located in the Amazon rainforest. The anomaly converts nearby plant matter into sections of the Wanderers’ Library.|| Serpent’s Hand operatives have reported that SCP-6000 has been located within SCP-4971. SCP-6000’s effects further expand SCP-4971, thus significantly reducing the chance of SCP-4971-▽ finding the entrance, and SCP-6000 has been limited to only converting SCP-4971. Furthermore, the Librarians’ ritualistic practices of maintaining the Serpent’s Library have caught the full focus of SCP-4971-▽‘s attention. {{- Director Lagaan}}||
||[[[SCP-3710]]] - 2 sled dog teams pulled by cybernetic canines and driven by abnormally formed humanoids claiming to be Elon Musk. They attempt to sell products to other racing dog-sledding teams, demanisfesting only when negotiations are not continued or are interrupted. Customers accepting offers will be transported far away with the product, while another SCP-3710 manifests, uses the customer&#39;s sled and cybernetically enhances their dogs.||[[[SCP-4062]]] - A male Ukrainian Shepherd Dog.

After a strong blizzard ocurred in the area, SCP-4062&#39;s improved shaking became extremely rapid to the point of causing a greatly-sized thermodynamic explosion, neutralizing all SCP-3710 entities. SCP-4062 and the other canines have not been harmed due to their enhacements, however, the blast had burned all of its fur, making it incapable of perfoming its anomalous abilty. {{- Rsr.

||[[[SCP-012-EX]]] - The human fear of a threat located in darkened areas, most often described as a series of metamorphic predatory humanoids. Delusioned subjects claim that these entities will manifest near and attack those that believe on its existence. These claims have been confirmed to be false.||[[[SCP-575]]] - A unknown form of black amorphous matter resembling darkness. They are conscious beings that manifests in areas without light, consuming other forms of life by absorbing them.||A unusual lack of human- and wildlife-targeted attacks by SCP-575 instances have been reported after public disinformation campaigns supporting SCP-012-EX&#39;s existence were created. It was discovered that SCP-575 instances were seeking and absorbing a new type of &#34;prey&#34; of unknown nature. Personnel theorize that these new victims are always present on unlit areas, which are easily accessible to SCP-575. It may be that consumption of these entities from SCP-575 could be so unchallenging that it ignores all other forms of life. {{- Rsr. Stark Turner}}||
||[[[SCP-6003]]] - An extradimensionally hidden island, previously home to an unknown ancient civilization who worshipped a wooden pillar resembling a lighthouse (SCP-6003-1) due to its ability to cause plant-matter and food to grow rapidly. For unknown reasons, it causes multiple disturbing anomalous events nearby humans to pressure them into entering and confining themselves inside of it.||[[[SCP-5693]]] - A mass colony of an undiscovered species of termite, located at the abandoned Disposal Site-27, capable of consuming any material in certain periods. They&#39;ll target religious and Akiva radiating objects, transforming it into woodpulp for either consumption or production of more instances.||After transporting the colony to SCP-6003, the SCP-5693 began to consume SCP-6003-1 externally and, eventually, internally. This has not only weakened SCP-6003&#39;s various anomalous effects, but also released the imprisoned Foudation personnel and SCP-6003&#39;s ancient residents. SCP-6003-1 attempts to stop this by growing trees near the island‘s shore, directing a partial majority of SCP-5693 away from the pillar, giving it brief opportunities to regenerate itself, before being consumed again. SCP-5693 that are distracted by additional trees will be launched away by the island&#39;s present storm and drown in the ocean, preventing the mass of SCP-5693 from overgrowing. {{- Rsr.

However, this action reverses SPC-WBLS&#39;s anti-contact capability,[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]It is theorized that SCP-WBLS&#39;s trait of being touched is conceptually inverted: if it is not capable of being physically contacted when it would be normally possible to do so, then the reverse of that statement is also possible.[[/span]] making pungilism of both selachians possible by thwacking SPC-WBLS whenever it is laying on SPC-1057&#39;s body. {{- Boxercrat Stark Turner}}||
|| [[[SCP-1322]]] - A miniature wormhole based in Site-122 connecting to an alternate universe. Its inhabitants are bent on the destruction of our universe following a sterility plague caused by the Foundation, utilizing advanced weaponry in its efforts. || [[[SCP-6001]]] - A micro-singularity located in Tokyo, Japan. It leads to a parallel universe where anomalies coexist with humanity under the guidance of the organization known as the Compendium. || A threshold was created between 1332 and 6001, allowing for both anomalies to access each other. Despite initial hostilities, a full-scale relief effort is in full effect by 6001 as 1322 works with 6001 for further technological advances.

|| [[[SCP-033]]] - A series of equations which produce Theta Prime, a previously unknown integer that fails to function alongside mathematics, resulting in the destruction of any mathematical objects through which it is placed (i.e. a calculator, paper, chalkboard). || [[[SCP-3669]]] - A book which teaches an unorthodox and seemingly incorrect method of preforming mathematics, which produces similarly abnormal results when applied to reality. || SCP-3669-2, the method of solving shown in SCP-3669, is used to compute SCP-033, leading to another, very similar number to Theta Prime, henceforth dubbed Theta Subprime. Attempts to solve SCP-033 using any other method results in this same number, effectively erasing Theta Prime from existence. Theta Subprime is an imaginary number whose only anomalous feature is in inability to be expressed using any form of standard notation, though this is anomalous only because is lies not on a spectrum based upon the square root of minus one, but instead the result of one divided by zero, as well as zero to the zeroth power (both values, previously thought to be undefined, are found on this number line). Knowledge of this other spectrum is the key to understanding the process outlined in SCP-3669, showing it to be a standard set of equations which are done in a roundabout manner using Theta Subprime. All anomalous activity that results from applying these mathematic in the real world are now understood to simply be natural phenomenon involving non-Euclidean geometry. {{- Researcher Fastthought}} ||
|| [[[SCP-1471]]] - A mobile app that, when downloaded, causes the owner of the device to receive images and eventually experience hallucinations of a nonhostile entity resembling a skeletal humanoid canine. || [[[SCP-6596]]] - A teleporting entity resembling a skeletal humanoid equine that annually steals food and other commodities from **##purple|the Polish containment Site##** after defeating its personnel in a battle of rhymes. || In preparation for SCP-6596&#39;s manifestation, all objects were removed from **##purple|the aforementioned facility##** except for several dozen mobile phones with SCP-1471 installed.  SCP-6596 took the devices and demanifested.  Roughly eight hours later, remaining SCP-1471-infected devices received two final messages:  a &#34;selfie&#34; of SCP-1471-A and SCP-6596 embracing, and a text reading &#34;I&#39;ve found someone new / she&#39;s nicer than you / goodbye, my good friends / our battles now end.&#34; Site-120 and Dir.
