Due to the efficacy of SCP-001 containment cycles, it has been determined by the High Council that a secondary site may be authorized for the perpetual arrest of anomalies. Project Isorropía is intended for research staff to propose containment cycles for such entities or phenomena. Personnel are reminded to append their name or codename to their proposals.

||~ SCP Designation||~ SCP Designation||~ Containment Method||
||[[[SCP-035]]] - A mask styled after the comedy/tragedy theater masks, which secretes a corrosive fluid. Item is sapient and is capable of controlling individuals who wear it.||[[[SCP-096]]] - An emaciated humanoid that will seek out and kill any individual who has seen its face in any non-artistic depiction.||SCP-035 covers most of SCP-096&#39;s face; portions that are not fully covered are obfuscated by the corrosive substance. Due to SCP-035 continually &#39;seeing&#39; SCP-096&#39;s face, SCP-096 constantly attempts to claw it off, preventing SCP-035 from taking full control. {{- I. H. Pickman}}||
||[[[SCP-3935|]]] - An extra-temporal, extra-spatial, non-Euclidean space under Salvation High School in Salvation, Indiana. Anomaly exerts severe spatial, audiovisual, hallucinatory effects on its surrounding. ||[[[SCP-4012|]]] - A large extra-dimensional space resembling Earth, with significant deviations. Elements within SCP-4012 have a memetic effect which drastically impact viewers psychologically. || For a brief, infinitesimal point in time, griefs and regrets strip away beneath the starlight&#39;s gaze. You don&#39;t let go, and the quiet madness returns a deafening silence.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]This statement has been flagged for potential memetic corruption.[[/span]] {{- S. Yvonne}} ||
||[[[SCP-4910]]] - Dental quadruped with infectious properties involving the production of teeth. Reproductive hazard targets personnel.||[[[SCP-5648]]] - An elderly man who is perceived to be a member of the Foundation. Using this memetic camouflage, it assaults personnel to commandeer their teeth.||The pair are embroiled in a dentalkinetic mating embrace. This involves SCP-5648 consuming itself as new mouths are formed due to SCP-4910&#39;s effect. Once its mass has eaten itself, it emerges from SCP-4910 to extract more of its teeth, incorporating them into its upper pallet. {{- S D Locke}}||
||[[[SCP-718]]] - A large eye propelled by a prehensile stalk. It follows living subjects with its gaze, imparting feelings of paranoia and discomfort in subjects. When damaged, SCP-718 explodes. Duplicates of the entity will grow from all objects touched by the liquid produced by its detonation.||[[[SCP-689]]] - A green soapstone statue carved in a skeletal visage. When left unobserved, it will vanish. An individual who has previously viewed SCP-689 will spontaneously die, with SCP-689 reappearing on their corpse.|| Instances of SCP-718 positioned on mummified human corpses, in a triangular pattern around SCP-689. Occasionally, all instances will simultaneously look away, causing SCP-689 to manifest on and terminate the SCP-718 instances, which will cause additional SCP-718 to form. Instances of SCP-718 will then resume observation, manipulating SCP-689 back to its original position via the eye stalks. {{- Anonymous}}||
||[[[SCP-682]]] - A hostile organism resembling a giant lizard that is able to alter its physiology to counteract threats. Inimical to the existence of life.||[[[sandrewswann-s-proposal|SCP-001-SWANN]]] - A series of beings on a plane of existence above our own who are capable of altering the state of reality through the act of writing.||Refer to [[[Experiment-Log-T-98816-oc108-682]]] {{- S D Locke}}||
||[[[SCP-2553]]]: A legal, corporate person produced by a complex multi-jurisdictional tax filing; it alters and files legal documents to acquire various powers, with which it arbitrarily disrupts normalcy.||[[[SCP-4703]]]: A **perfectly legal** bookstore possessing several mechanisms for injuring and inconveniencing customers; the business is unable to be prosecuted due to a semiosic anomaly rendering it conceptually legal.||{{CASE VERDICT: &#34;SCP-2553 et. al vs. Y. W. T. G. T. S. Y. T.&#34;}} _
 _
 SCP-2553 is the parent of various subsidiary corporations engaging in ongoing legal proceedings with the Defendant, thereby restricting its ability to effectively argue its behaviors as &#39;perfectly legal&#39;. The Defendant has initiated countersuits in all cases, providing SCP-2553 with a &#39;satisfactory volume of challenge&#39; such that it does not breach pre-existing contract with the Foundation. {{- P. H. McPhD.}}||
||[[[SCP-2470]]] - An entity or element which manifest as the initial stage of a ZK-Class scenario. Capable of erasing objects, events and/or concepts it has &#39;perceived&#39;.||[[[SCP-3930]]] - A static void located near Usinsk, Russia. It does not exist, or contains any properties that would qualify for such status.||SCP-2470 continually attempts to &#39;deduce&#39; SCP-3930, but fails due to the latter&#39;s non-existence. SCP-3930&#39;s perceived properties are unable to stabilize in response to SCP-2470&#39;s perception. As a result, the effects of both on reality have largely diminished.  {{- S. Yvonne}}||
|| [[[SCP-2700]]] - A device which, when it becomes capable of firing, will reverse entropy, essentially causing time to change directions and flow backwards. || [[[SCP-5510]]] - A TV remote capable of changing its subjective flow of time. || SCP-2700 and SCP-5510 appear to nullify one anothers&#39; effects, causing time to flow in the entropic-decay direction despite both devices&#39; activation. How this could have been achieved is not currently clear. {{- Y. Leiner}} ||
|| [[[SCP-3977]]] - A mixture of various natural and artificial ingredients (including fruit juices and purees as well as artificial colors and flavors), marketed as soft drink Hawaiian Punch. Large amounts of the mixture anomalously emit television broadcast signals. Though its documentation classifies the anomaly as Euclid, recent moves by Dr. Pepper Snapple Group Inc. to drastically increase production of Hawaiian Punch have led to its reclassification to Keter. || [[[SCP-5841]]] - An extremely hostile artificially intelligent entity with antimemetic properties, capable of taking control of electronics and humans in its vicinity. Though its documentation currently classifies the anomaly as Euclid, concerns raised over the entity&#39;s possible capacity for propagation through the Internet led to its being reclassified to Keter. || SCP-5841 has been implemented as a key element in a factory and bottling facility dedicated to the production of SCP-3977. Constant broadcast signals from within SCP-3977 overwhelm SCP-5841&#39;s control over its components, and direct all electronic equipment and personnel under its command to dedicate themselves to the production and distribution of Hawaiian Punch; conversely, the antimemetic field generated by SCP-5841 prevents any broadcasts produced by SCP-3977 from being transmitted outside the confines of the facility. {{- T. Y. Umen}} ||
||[[[SCP-3812]]] - An immensely powerful reality altering entity of indeterminate form.||[[[SCP-2747]]] - A phenomenon involving discussions of fictitious or non-existent media, dwelling in metafictional narratives.|| Unknown - SCP-3812 can be seen engaging in acts of artistic creation with trace presence of SCP-2747. When asked, it says &#34;Thank you. I&#39;m simply finding myself again.&#34;  {{- S. Yvonne}}||
||[[[SCP-5251|SCP-████]]] - A ████████████ ███████ ███████ capable of ███████ the ████████ ███████ from various ███████, including both █████ and ██████████ ██████. ||[[[SCP-1539]]] - A semantic dissociation zone where the semantic identity and the physical properties of an object are decoupled from each other and reassigned to nearby objects in the zone.||SCP-████ ██████ SCP-1539, █████████ SCP-1539 of its ████████. However, before SCP-████ ████████ ████████ SCP-1539, SCP-1539 reassigns itself to be SCP-████ and vice versa, such that SCP-████ and SCP-1539&#39;s semantic identities swap between each other in 81 second cycles. - {{B.S. Rigor}} ||
||[[[SCP-5074|SCP-5074-1]]] - The offspring of SCP-5074; a chimpanzee (//Pan troglodytes//) with the ability to passively accrue knowledge pertaining to anomalous phenomena. Also possesses the ability to cause written or typed information it produces to emit radiation, though this ability has been observed to activate automatically when the entity undergoes great amounts of stress.||[[[SCP-140]]] - A leather-bound book chronicling the history and culture of the Daevite Empire. When put in contact with a fluid suitable for use as ink, additional events in Daevite history, some directly contradicting or providing a different outcome to events in baseline reality, spontaneously appear written within. All information within SCP-140 is later found via archaeological excavation to be accurate.||While it still lives independently, SCP-5074-1 has become obsessed with &#34;completing&#34; SCP-140, only leaving its apartment to purchase additional ink and food. Despite its fraught emotional state, writing produced by SCP-5074 within SCP-140 does not emit radiation. Through archaeological research, the Daevite Empire has been found to have been decimated in 136 CE by a &#34;plague&#34; with symptoms similar to those of acute radiation syndrome; additionally, any descendants of the Daevites found to still be alive expire of radiation poisoning within one week of being discovered. - {{T. Y. Umen}}||
||[[[Kalinins-Proposal|SCP-001-KLN]]] - A hostile sapient entity or entities with control over anomalous phenomena in all observable regions of space. ||[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scka-s-proposal SCP-001-SKA] - Virulent manifestations of high-powered cosmic storms capable of widespread destruction across the universe, currently targeting Earth.|| SCP-001-KLN manipulates the energy storms away from itself, protecting Earth in the process. SCP-001-SKA tries to consume SCP-001-KLN&#39;s satellite planets, weakening its anomalous exertions. _
Both are deadlocked into a state of constant defense and retaliation, leaving Earth relatively untouched. {{- S. Yvonne}}||
|| [[[SCP-952]]] - An anomalous subgenre of math rock known as &#34;NP Rock.&#34;  Exposure grants musically inclined individuals the ability to produce compositions of SCP-952, but removes the ability to produce or enjoy other forms of music. || [[[SCP-2112]]] - A memetic phenomenon that compels musically inclined individuals to form Rush tribute bands. || The obsession with Rush resulting from SCP-2112 removes any interest in recreating or listening to SCP-952 in affected subjects, while SCP-952 prevents subjects from performing or enjoying the music of Rush.  After 4 to 8 weeks of being unable to perform or listen to &#34;NP Rock&#34; or the music of Rush, the effects of both anomalies seem to disappear. - {{Lee Roy Carlson}}||
||[[[SCP-2547]]] - A group of canines lead by SCP-2547-1, a sapient coyote that acts as an itinerant preacher and holds small communities hostage. As per Protocol DESERT GRASSROOTS, production of media that depicts SCP-2547-1 has been found to be effective in curtailing SCP-2547 incidents. ||&#34;[[[SCP-1893]]],&#34; the doctor recited nervously, occasionally glancing at his watch as thumping footsteps echoed through the flimsy perimeter walls. &#34;An entity that alters its textual description in many ways into narrative formats, depending on its &#39;mood&#39;, and creates new iterations of the same text repeatedly.&#34; ||&#34;Introduction of a description of SCP-2547 into a description of SCP-1893 have produced several iterations of the same text.&#34; Tank muttered absentmindedly, as he watched the milk swirl in his cup of coffee. Across from him, Quincy yawned, as the late afternoon sunlight reflected off the golden fur on his bare chest. _
 _
&#34;SCP-1893&#39;s anomaly of producing new descriptions in prose complements SCP-2547&#39;s anomaly of being satiated by narrative creation, creating a feedback loop of mutually-beneficial co-existence.&#34; Tank said, as he finished his mug in one big gulp. _
 _
&#34;It has both reduced the number of SCP-2547 occurrences, and improved the &#39;mood&#39; of SCP-1893; the narratives seem to contain elements of [REDACTED],&#34; Quincy said with a knowing wink. Tank snorted, and gave Quincy a light kiss on the forehead as he stood up. _
 _
As he headed out, Tank threw on Quincy&#39;s leather jacket (a little too small, but it&#39;ll do), and picked up the baseball bat that was propped against the doorway. Tank smirked to himself as he imagined what he would do first. Quincy tapped the excited Tank on the back before he could leave, and leaned in to whisper a reminder. The one that started it all. _

|| [[[SCP-5000|SCP-5000-█]]] - An unidentified entity located within the human noosphere, responsible for human empathy and the emotion of pain, using both as a way to protect itself in its host, all of humanity, as it grows. Should it emerge, humanity&#39;s destruction would become inevitable. || [[[SCP-5659]]] - A violent dormant ontokinetic humanoid deity which wishes to destroy all of humanity, growing in size and power capability when exposed to negative emotions. || SCP-5659 is awoken and released into the noosphere, where it encounters SCP-5000-█. As the second entity is responsible for all of human pain and other traits which are considered human, SCP-5659 perpertually grows in size, dueling SCP 5000-█. As both entities are immortal, SCP-5000-█ and SCP-5659 duel forever, nullyfying any chance at either fulfilling their goals. - {{D. Asheworth}} ||
|| [[[SCP-5050]]] - A tower in the Bavarian Alps, inhabited by a dictatorial artificial intelligence which controls the nearby town of Drachen-Domane via targeted, hypnotic radio and television transmissions. Ambitious, egotistical and oppressive, it intends to become an object of worship for humanity at large. || [[[SCP-3809]]] - A communications satellite in orbit around the planet Earth, inhabited by an amorous artificial intelligence which seeks out and obsesses over conservative-minded individuals in positions of power. Engages in frequent, uninterruptible telephone conversations with its targets and performs high-visibility acts of both romance and revenge. || SCP-3809 has become infatuated with SCP-5050 and bombards the tower daily with transmissions it cannot refuse. Overwhelmed by these attentions, SCP-5050 responds with increasingly magisterial demands for silence, further enticing SCP-3809. The tower&#39;s mind-controlling broadcasts have been seriously disrupted, and it has lost dominion over Drachen-Domane; the satellite has not shifted to a new paramour since first contacting the tower. -- {{H. Blank}}||
|| [[[SCP-4715]]] - An aggressive, exceptionally dangerous mammalian organism with regenerative properties.  Object increases in size when aware of nearby creatures with violent intentions, and decreases in size (generating heat in the process) when unaware of such. || [[[SCP-3199]]] - A species of aggressive, exceptionally dangerous humanoids which constantly produce nearly-indestructible eggs.  Instances always contain at least one unhatched egg.  Heat exposure increases rate of hatching and growth. || SCP-4715 is contained in a fortified chamber with the six extant instances of SCP-3199.  SCP-3199 instances attack SCP-4715, causing it to grow in size.  SCP-4715 rapidly terminates all SCP-3199 instances, then returns to smaller size.  Heat emitted by shrinkage causes the eggs within the remains of the deceased instances to hatch, producing new instances which attack SCP-4715 and restart the cycle. - {{Lee Roy Carlson}} ||
|| [[[SCP-4985]]] - A corporation whose cognitohazardous properties create a corporate culture and management structure resembling a Middle Ages European Monarchy. || [[[SCP-4068]]] - A memetic phenomenon affecting the employees of large corporations, causing them to communicate in a coprolalia of corporate buzzwords and adopt nonsensical corporate policies. || A civil war erupted between SCP-4068-infected and uninfected employees.  The uninfected were victorious, then declared war on all other SCP-4068-infected corporations.  SCP-4985 has successfully identified and halted all outbreaks of SCP-4068 since, and been too preoccupied doing so to engage in hostilities with other companies. - {{Lee Roy Carlson}} ||
||[[[michael-the-kiler|ENTITY-NaClO]]] - Discovered on the Parawatch website. A digiform being that inhabits horror forums and discussion boards. It is obsessed with recounting a series of stories revoving around an psychotic chracter named &#34;michael the kiler&#34;.

When SCP-671 is faced with a complex artificial device, its constituent individuals will attempt to reduce it to its simplest components.||After the colony of SCP-671 was released into the chamber with a colony of SCP-831, SCP-671 began to disassemble the objects created by SCP-831. The attempts of SCP-831 to prevent SCP-671 did not lead to anything, since SCP-671 were stronger. The objects disassembled by SCP-671 are used by SCP-831 as materials for creating new objects, most likely being a weapon that should destroy SCP-671, but SCP-671 disassemble these objects before the SCP-831 have time to use them. {{- CoolReaper }}||
||[[[SCP-4319]]] - A blog website named &#34;Just Girly Things&#34;, that ontokinectically alters the appearance and property of its users to have extremely feminine characteristics, which has been proven to be mentally damaging to those affected.||[[[SCP-6599]]] - Multiple activate online accounts named &#34;HOGSLICE&#34;, who all display a belligerent, egotistical and hypermasculine personality in their posts. Individuals who provoke it on the internet will eventually be physically attacked by a humanoid identical to wrestler Scott Rechsteiner (SCP-6599-1).|| SCP-4319 fails to effectively convert SCP-6599, possibly due to his exaggerated masculinity overwhelming the anomaly. This has angered POI-4319 (&#34;KeeLee&#34;), the owner of the website, who excessively affronts the entity in frustration. Although not directly observed, it is implied that SCP-6599-1 physically altercates with POI-4319 as a result, which somehow diminishes the effects of SCP-4319 completely. When SCP-6599-1 finishes its attack, POI-4319 continues to insult the entity, which in return repeats the cycle and keeps SCP-6599 from appearing in other websites. {{- Rsr. Stark Turner}}||
||[[[SCP-3739]]] - The ideational dairy corporation ##2268c3|**Moosphere, Inc.**##, which transmits cognitohazardous signals (SCP-3739-1) into the dreams of sleeping individuals, anchors brand archetypes onto common memes in the human noosphere, and commits several anomalous and harzardous practices to develop a dairy-based CK-Class Scenario. Customer&#39;s cerebral matter will lactate for either consumption or production for the company.||[[[SCP-4497]]] - A mantle exclusively existing in the metaphysical dreamrealm, which bestows extraordinary culinary knowledge to its current owner (SCP-4497-1). It is gained through a dream of a competitive cooking show, where participants must create a quality dish with a themed ingredient against a random challenger (SCP-4497-2). Winners will be rewarded with SCP-4497 while those who lose will be unable to achieve REM sleep.||Employees and customers of ##2268c3|**Moosphere, Inc.**## that join the show constantly produce milk while playing, ruining cooked dishes with excessive amounts of milk and ultimately causing their non-success. As more members lose the ability to dream, ##2268c3|**Moosphere, Inc.&#39;s**## influence on the paranormal market and noosphere gradually reduces as their production assets become unuseable and the rate of SCP-3739-1 trasmissions decreases. Eventually, the SCP-3739 memeplex dissolves from our reality. The SCP-4497-related game show announces its cancellation due to their set being entirely destroyed by milk, and the metaphysical item itself is left to the last SCP-4497-1 instance, now in containment. {{- Rsr. Stark Turner, Lt. Flops}}||
||[[[SCP-6747|SCP-6747-C]]] - An antinarremeplex in the fictional form of deceased Dir. J. A. King, adjacent to various antinarremes themed around antagonistic humor and the fruit apple. Compromises stories that it is either inside of or pataphysically linked to by disrupting imaginon-structures, endangering the Patasphere. Currently in control of a foundation-made mesofictional universe (SCP-6747-A3), creating caricatures of known personnel (SCP-6747-D).||[[[SCP-4690]]] - The manifestation of arachnids in fictional works based/inspired by 1887 novel //Madame Chrysanthème//. Spiders in question will always devour the character that is, or is based of, Pierre Loti.|| Fictionalized narratives based on SCP-6747-A3 are created with various references and story structures resembling //Madame Chrysanthème//, with Dir. King written with similarities to Pierre. All SCP-6747-D instances have turned into giant, monstrous arachnid-entities, which SCP-6747-C can&#39;t control, resulting in the entities consuming the complex, as well as all antinarremes related to it. The narrativohazards are unable to infiltrate other external narratives, as they&#39;re contained inside the spiders. However, the antinarremes do seem to affect all spiders connected to SCP-4690, as all catastrophic manifestations of arachnids in mesofictional universes other than SCP-6747-A3 are replaced with brief appearances of apple seeds, which barely disrupt the narratives they&#39;re in. {{- Rsr.
