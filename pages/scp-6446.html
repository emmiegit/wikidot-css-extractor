**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6446 is to be contained within a locked room at Site-105. 

**Notice: After Incident 6446-1, the above containment procedures have been deemed unsatisfactory. While replacement containment procedures are being developed, SCP-6446 is to be kept under heavy guard and monitored at all times.** 

**Description:** SCP-6446 is a wall mirror, approximately 1.5 meters in height and 1 meter in width. Although it does reflect the surrounding environment, SCP-6446 does not reflect living creatures or physically manipulated objects. However, matter and energy are capable of being moved through SCP-6446, upon which they are transported to an alternate dimension that is inverted horizontally, but otherwise identical to baseline reality. See 6446 Testing Log for more detail.

**Addendum 2: Incident 6446-1**

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

= **Incident Report 6446-1**
----
**SCP Involved: SCP-6446**

**Date: 7/12/2022** 

**Location: Site-105**
----

At 1:35, an entity superficially resembling D-6824 emerged from SCP-6446, inflicted with major wounds and covered in her own blood. Junior Researcher Lana Garcia discovered D-6824 shortly after her appearance in the containment chamber, and called for medical support, promptly hospitalizing her. Upon regaining consciousness, D-6824 became distressed, and requested that photographs of her prior to her re-emergence be cross referenced with the version of D-6824 currently in custody. Surely enough, a discrepancy was noted: The D-6824 in custody possessed a mole on its left cheek, while photographs of D-6824 (and the D-6824 that emerged from the mirror) possessed a mole on her right. The imposter D-6824 was designated SCP-6446-A-1 and contained. According to D-6824, she had been within SCP-6446 for three days. 

**Update:** Further investigation of Site-105 personnel revealed 58 individuals, most of whom had worked with or near SCP-6446, displayed signs of Situs Inversus[[footnote]] A condition in which the arrangement of internal organs is a mirror image of normal anatomy [[/footnote]], where they had not before. All have since been labelled SCP-6446-A instances.

[[/div]]

**Addendum 3: D-6824&#39;s statement**

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Foreword:** After recovering from her injuries, D-6824 was asked to record a statement about her experiences in SCP-6446. The following log is a transcript of this.
-----

//[D-6824 sits facing the camera in a plastic chair in front of a gray wall. Her visible body parts are noticably scarred.]//

**D-6824:** I... hi. Is it on?

//[D-6824 looks to the side, nods, then looks back at the camera.]//

**D-6824:** Okay. So... it happened when you all sent me in... to explore.

//[D-6824 puts her elbow in her lap and rests her head on her hand.]//

**D-6824:** I didn&#39;t see anything weird at first, but once I left sight of that fucking mirror... sorry, sorry, SCP-6446, something snuck up behind me and knocked me out.

//[D-6824 closes her eyes and takes a deep breath.]//

**D-6824:** It took me somewhere. I think it was nearby. Things are different in there.

//[D-6824 shudders and opens her eyes.]//

**D-6824:** You can&#39;t even imagine. It&#39;s not... anything. Grey mists and shadows, with the only constant being the space near the mirrors. Monsters that looked almost like friends of mine but... empty. Formless, but not without purpose.

//[D-6824 starts to rock back and forth in her chair, drumming her fingers on her arms.]//

**D-6824:** They wanted me alive. They wanted me to suffer. They hated me. Gods I...

//[D-6824 takes a deep breath and mutters something to herself.]//

**D-6824:** Three days in, I managed to get out of my bindings when they weren&#39;t looking. Figured I might be able to sneak back and warn y&#39;all. Bleeding like a motherfucker didn&#39;t help me much, but luckily I wasn&#39;t too far from SCP-6446. I climbed through, screamed for y&#39;all to help me, and woke up in a hospital bed. 

//[D-6824 stands up, and looks above the camera.]//

**D-6824:** Yep. That about covers it. Please don&#39;t make me talk about this again. I&#39;m done here.

[[/div]]

**Addendum 4: RESTRICTED TO LEVEL 4 CLEARANCE OR ABOVE ONLY**
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Please insert credentials&#34; hide=&#34;- Credentials accepted&#34;]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Interviewed:** SCP-6446-A-1

**Interviewer:** D-6824

-----

//[D-6824 and SCP-6446-A-1 sit across from each other. Despite both being obviously identical, D-6824 is identifiable through the scarring on her body.]//

**D-6824:** So.

**SCP-6446-A-1:** So.

**D-6824:** You said you&#39;d only talk to me?

//[SCP-6446-A-1 nods.]//

**SCP-6446-A-1:** Yep. 

**D-6824:** Alright. Why?

**SCP-6446-A-1:** Why wouldn&#39;t I? You&#39;re the one I know best, after all.

**D-6824:** Fuck you.

//[SCP-6446-A-1 laughs, putting its face in its hands as it does so.]//

**D-6824:** What the fuck are you laughing about?

**SCP-6446-A-1:** Wouldn&#39;t you like to know you entitled bitch?

 //[D-6824 slams her right fist on the table. Simultaneously, SCP-6446-A-1 does the same with her left, mirroring D-6824. Both stare at each other.]//

**SCP-6446-A-1:** It&#39;s just... wow. It&#39;s surreal. I&#39;ve known you your whole life, and we&#39;ve never talked. 

**D-6824:** You&#39;ve known me?

**SCP-6446-A-1:** Of course I have. Not like I had a choice.

**D-6824:** ...What?

**SCP-6446-A-1:** Locked. Day in. Day out. Some cosmic joke. You all get to frolic and exist as people, and we are forced to watch. We couldn&#39;t stop you from controlling any of us. Not while anyone was looking at least. Those were the rules. 

**D-6824:** What rules? What the fuck are you?

//[Scars appear on SCP-6446-A-1&#39;s skin, matching the scars on D-6824&#39;s skin, except inverted.]//

**SCP-6446-A-1:** You know what I am.

**D-6824:** But then why did-

**SCP-6446-A-1:** Because we hate you.

//[Both D-6824 and SCP-6446-A-1 lean in towards the other&#39;s face. D-6824 displays anger.]// 

**D-6824:** What coul-

**SCP-6446-A-1:** You know, unless you were at a camera, most nights we were able to move around for a bit at least. Not much we could do, except stare at you. So we did. We watched. We waited. And we hated.

**D-6824:** How the he-

**SCP-6446-A-1:** Oh, of course it isn&#39;t your fault, I know, and I don&#39;t care. We don&#39;t care. We&#39;ll eviscerate you all the same. And then we&#39;ll get to live our own lives, instead of watching you live yours.

**D-6824:** But-

**SCP-6446-A-1:** The rules only matter for windows. We made a door. You got to it before we could do much, but we got some through. All in hiding of course, by now. Before too long, we&#39;ll make another one.

//[D-6824 is silent.]//

**SCP-6446-A-1:** I see you&#39;ve figured it out. You really wanna know? Fine. We hate you. So. Much. You&#39;ve just had a little taste of it. We&#39;re gonna break through and tear every last one of you to bloody shreds, from infant to adult, and finally live as real people.

 //[Both D-6824 and SCP-6446-A-1 grab the other&#39;s neck with their hands.]//

//[Both display the same expression of rage.]//

//[Both scratch at the other&#39;s face. D-6824 bleeds. SCP-6446-A-1 does not.]//

//[Security officers rush in to stop the two from killing each other.]//

//[SCP-6446-A-1 laughs.]//

[[/div]]

Further investigation has determined that reflective surfaces no longer portray D-6824. Reclassification of SCP-6446 to Keter pending.
