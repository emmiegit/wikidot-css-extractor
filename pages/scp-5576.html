**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5576 is currently housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-228. Special research conducted into SCP-5576 has been authorised and is currently under observation by Overwatch Command.

Further information regarding SCP-5576 is restricted.


------

**Description:** SCP-5576 is Jonathan Möller, former director of Site-228. SCP-5576&#39;s anomalous properties manifest one minute following its death, wherein all matter located within a roughly three-metre radius experiences a temporal reversion of approximately two minutes. All objects and individuals within this area are affected, including SCP-5576, with the only known exception being its memory.

Investigations into the mechanisms of SCP-5576&#39;s anomalous properties are ongoing.

------

**Discovery:** SCP-5576&#39;s anomalous properties were discovered in 2008, at the age of 96, 11 years after retirement, during a house fire. Based on surveillance footage, it passed away approximately 30 times due to smoke inhalation prior to the firefighters&#39; arrival on the scene.

Following Foundation intervention, cover story A3549B (&#34;Immolation&#34;) was embedded into local news media and amnestics were appropriately administered. SCP-5576&#39;s family was supplied with a suitable corpse and the object was detained for questioning and research.

**Interviewee:** SCP-5576

**Interviewer:** Dr Albert Cren
----
= **[BEGIN LOG]**
------

**Dr Cren:** Good afternoon, Jon.

**SCP-5576:** It&#39;s alright, you can call me by my skip ID, Al. I don&#39;t really mind.

**Dr Cren:** It&#39;s the first time I&#39;m doing this with a former mate, you know.

**SCP-5576:** Ha. The first ten&#39;ll be weird, but you get used to it.

//Dr Cren subtly smiles.//

**Dr Cren:** Well, how are you, Jon?

//Dr Cren and SCP-5576 speak in unison.//

**Dr Cren:** Just being?

**SCP-5576:** Just being.

//Both laugh.//

**SCP-5576:** Haha! You remember?

**Dr Cren:** How could I not? I&#39;ve only heard it every day!

**SCP-5576:** Oh! I remember ol&#39; Jem started saying it too. What a lad. He still working here?

**Dr Cren:** Oh no, unfortunately. Took an early retirement. Most of the old bunch &#39;ere miss him too, sometimes.

**SCP-5576:** Oh, what a shame. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll forget him. But, on to some better news!

**Dr Cren:** Oh?

**SCP-5576:** Look at you bud! Got your SR promotion while I was gone, didn&#39;t cha&#39;.

**Dr Cren:** Huh? Oh, haha! Thanks, Jon.

**SCP-5576:** I say, it ain&#39;t long before you become a director, &#39;specially since you even worked under me for a while.

**Dr Cren:** Heh. Director, huh... I&#39;ve never actually thought about that. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve aspired that far ahead in this career either, knowing it first hand.

**SCP-5576:** Oh trust me, I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be long &#39;till you get to that point. Not everyone becomes one either, so you gotta be proud of yourself, Al. And as a bonus, you&#39;re usually far away from the action. And you&#39;ll be sitting in the same seat as I did, back in the day. As long as they didn&#39;t replace it of course, which, when thinking about it, they probably did.

//SCP-5576 exaggeratedly sighs and the two laugh together. Midway through SCP-5576 wheezes.//

**SCP-5576:** Well, how old&#39;s Nina now? Twelve? Fifteen?

**Dr Cren:** She&#39;s eleven now. They grow up pretty darn fast, Jon.

**SCP-5576:** I bet they do. I remember exactly what she was like, that lovable little rascal.

**Dr Cren:** Oh, she&#39;s still that alright. You won&#39;t know how much trouble she gets into with Kalli, though I don&#39;t always try to get on her side. Somebody&#39;s gotta defend the kids now, shouldn&#39;t they?

**SCP-5576:** Of course, it&#39;s probably ain&#39;t nice for the kid, not that I&#39;m an expert when it comes to the topic.

**Dr Cren:** Well... heh, &#34;fifteen?&#34; You still suck when it comes to keeping track of time, now don&#39;t you? Deadlines always had a way of creeping up on you, didn&#39;t they? I remember I&#39;d usually be the one picking up your slack.

**SCP-5576:** Oh jeez, thinking back, that&#39;s at least a decade now, ain&#39;t it? I can&#39;t thank you enough for every time you&#39;ve helped me, Al. I was one forgetful ass.

//The two laugh, louder than previously.//

**Dr Cren:** I couldn&#39;t just leave you hanging bud, well, at least you&#39;re--

//Dr Cren is told to cease their idle conversation and is reminded to continue with the interrogation.//

**Dr Cren:** Oh, um, SCP-557--

//SCP-5576 interruptingly sighs and holds up its hand, as if to stop Dr Cren from speaking any further.//

**SCP-5576:** Let me guess now. They tell you to &#34;cease your pleasantries,&#34; or something along those lines? Oh, I bet.

//Dr Cren averts his eyes to look away and stutters.//

**Dr Cren:** Let&#39;s... uh, let&#39;s continue, SCP-5576.

//SCP-5576 grins but does not make any remark.//

**Dr Cren:** Well, to start off: did you know of your anomalous properties before the incident?

**SCP-5576:** It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve died, Al. I-It don&#39;t feel nice, but--

//SCP-5576 coughs.//

**SCP-5576:** To, ahem, continue, I&#39;ve never knew about it. I could&#39;ve been like this since... since I was a lad, honestly.

**Dr Cren:** Hm, we--

**SCP-5576:** You know, I&#39;ve been with many anomalies during the time I was here. You could say, these properties may be a result of that, you know.

**Dr Cren:** You&#39;re right, we think so too. They&#39;re looking into all the objects you were in contact with during your days—well, years—here currently, and to see if there&#39;s any sort of connection between any of &#39;em acting to give you this ability.

**SCP-5576:** Yes, yes. Standard procedure, eh?

//Dr Cren lightly chuckles at SCP-5576&#39;s remark.//

**Dr Cren:** Yep, the standard. You think there may be any other reason, though? Other than the one we just talked about.

**SCP-5576:** Tough to say. Let&#39;s see... hm. I used to work with a lot of ontokinetic anomalies. Particularly reality-benders.

**Dr Cren:** You worked with reality benders?

//SCP-5576 pauses.//

**SCP-5576:** Plenty of &#39;em, yeah.

**Dr Cren:** That&#39;s... odd.

**SCP-5576:** Something wrong?

**Dr Cren:** I&#39;m not spotting any on this list.

//Dr Cren hands SCP-5576 the files he was looking through.//

**SCP-5576:** These... these are all the anomalies I&#39;ve been involved in?

**Dr Cren:** Yep.

**SCP-5576:** Oh... yeah. No one knows, do they?

**Dr Cren:** Hm?

**SCP-5576:** You know, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever told you this, or anyone else here at &#39;228, but--

**Dr Cren:** You&#39;ve worked at Site-17?

**SCP-5576:** What? How&#39;d--

**Dr Cren:** I read your personnel file right before this interview. I was... surprised, to say the least. Couldn&#39;t believe it, honestly. So it&#39;s real? Did you... really?

//SCP-5576 creases its eyes and rubs them.//

**SCP-5576:** What&#39;d you think of me, if I said yes, Albert?

**Dr Cren:** Well, they&#39;re rumours, aren&#39;t they? I mean... I wouldn&#39;t see you in a different light, just because of that. You&#39;re still my mate... a friend.

//SCP-5576 has a pained expression and wipes its eyes.//

**SCP-5576:** Thanks, Al.

//SCP-5576 pauses.//

**SCP-5576:** Most of &#39;em, [[[he-who-screws-with-reality |they&#39;re unlisted]]].

**Dr Cren:** They weren&#39;t registered? Why?

//SCP-5576 does not respond. Dr Cren is silent for a moment.//

**Dr Cren:** But, that means...

//SCP-5576 weakly nods and looks down at its feet.//

**SCP-5576:** I was sent to &#39;17 during my rookie years. I was an enthusiastic lad back then, you could say I was... determined. I didn&#39;t give up. Part of the reason why I tried to help everyone... put there.

//Pauses.//

**SCP-5576:** All of &#39;em who got sent there, I wanted to help &#39;em all the best I could. Didn&#39;t do what everyone else did, couldn&#39;t bring myself to it. I was stubborn, for the most part.

**Dr Cren:** So you tried to help them? Well... of course you would, Jon. Yeah, you were always a nice guy.

//SCP-5576 looks down.//

**SCP-5576:** I tried my best, Al. I did everything I could, but... but, I gave up.

//Pauses.//

**SCP-5576:** I stopped caring after seeing it over and over, for years. I... I forgot to...

//SCP-5576 looks back up, its lips quivering.//

**SCP-5576:** It haunts me, Albert. At first, I thought I could just push it away. I... before I retired, I got them to make me forget. I didn&#39;t want to think about it again, I just wanted to enjoy my time with the family I have left, without being cursed by... by those //faces//... those memories. It was a powerful dose. It worked... it did, but...

//Its smile wavers.//

**SCP-5576:** But, you know, Al... recently, it&#39;s all been coming back to me. Just flooding my head with all of it. I guess even they couldn&#39;t keep those memories buried forever.

//Pauses.//

**SCP-5576:** I&#39;ve sat in that seat, for thousands -- no, //millions// of times. More times than I could possibly remember. But to sit on this side of the table, it&#39;s new. Deep down, you could say I wanted this, Albert. I&#39;m happy.

**Dr Cren:** But... why, Jon?

//Dr Cren stutters.//

**Dr Cren:** It&#39;s... it&#39;s alright, I know you never wanted to do any of that. If you&#39;d like, I&#39;m pretty sure the infirmary can give you another dose.

//SCP-5576 coughs, smiling slightly.//

**SCP-5576:** No, Al, that&#39;s okay. If this is someone cursing me, I accept it. I don&#39;t spite them back. And in all honesty, it simply wouldn&#39;t be fair for me to live a happy, normal life with [[[site-17-hub |everything I&#39;ve done]]].
