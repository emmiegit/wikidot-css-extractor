[[include component:image-block name=napkin.jpg|caption=Dr. Timmer writing a memo, shortly prior to recording the first photographic evidence of SCP-7705.|width=300px]]

SCP-7705 is to be utilised in Foundation operations as a means of recruiting suitable personnel for Site-79&#39;s Mathematics Department. Recruitment posters alluding to &#34;napkin math&#34; are to be issued and distributed to mathematics programs at institutions of higher learning, attributed to the &#34;Standard Computing Program&#34;.

In the event that SCP-7705 is suitably proven to exist in mundane science, Disinformation Protocol DIP-7705 is to be enacted. DIP-7705 entails an immediate media effort centered around SCP-7705 as a psychological phenomenon. All evidence to the contrary is to be suppressed via amnestics, due to the potential expansion of research into phenomena easily verifiable as anomalous.

SCP-7705 refers to the significant degradation of mathematical skills in humans when utilising a table napkin as a medium upon which to conduct written work. SCP-7705 is believed to result in at least $26.5 Million (USD) in financial losses per year, as well as at least two recorded fatalities in human spaceflight. 

Notably, SCP-7705 is a reliable method of identifying members of the public who hold a high Cognitive Resistance Value. Therefore, the derivative Napkin Test is to be administered to all personnel entering the Mathematics Department, stationed at Site-79.

SCP-7705 is also believed to instill a higher degree of confidence than usual in calculations inscribed on a napkin. Numerous cases of violence rooted in mathematics have since been traced to SCP-7705. There are three well-documented instances of violence originating with SCP-7705:

* On August 11, 1983, Dr. Andrea Sherman, Professor of Mathematics at Indiana University, reportedly became agitated while dining in the cafeteria. Sherman, while gesturing to a napkin bearing a simple algebraic mistake, seized a knife and drove it through the hand of graduate student Helen Uerlich. Uerlich was hospitalized and Sherman charged with assault, record of which has since been expunged by Foundation order.
* On October 4, 1986, Agent Bill Regant was assigned to Provisional Site-506 in New York City, USA. While attempting to explain the source of a nearby modulated signal to colleague and radio operator Kenneth Pierce, Regant became belligerent. Regant traveled outside and assaulted a television presenter, in his confusion believing the presenter to be Agent Pierce. According to Pierce, an argument began after challenging Regant&#39;s calculations on a napkin.
* On June 4, 2014, Muhammad Basiyid, pilot of a private jet in Kuwait, attempted to calculate his trajectory mid-flight on a paper napkin given to him with his lunch at the previous airport. Basiyid would later stray into Iranian airspace, where he was forced to land. Basiyid insisted that the &#34;maps were wrong&#34;, and slapped an Iranian police officer across the face. 

**Addendum:**

On August 22, 2023, a grievous error in the size of metal cylinders used for the transport of [[[SCP-7502 |an anomalous liquid sample]]] resulted in the death of several personnel when the cylinders ruptured. Dr. Lane Petri, whose calculations caused the error as a result of SCP-7705, was brought before Foundation Provisional Court (FPC) to assess the extent of their culpability for the accident.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

//Proceedings begin. FPC consists of eleven site directors (attending virtually), in addition to an unidentified member of Overwatch Command.//

**05 Personnel (05P):** Dr. Petri, please take a seat. The court is instructed to keep an open mind and regard this case with impartiality. Dr. Petri, please explain your actions on August 22.

**Petri:** Well, I was getting my things together for the morning, since I was flying out to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43 43] for the day. When I saw the email asking for cylinder specs, I decided to take care of it in the cafeteria. 

**Director Belkova, Site-103:** Surely you must have felt pretty confident in your calculations, if you thought you could do them so hastily as that, right?

**Petri:** Oh absolutely, sir. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve fully conveyed how, without this SCP, this sort of thing is just second-nature to me. And I don&#39;t mean that as a brag! I can&#39;t make this kind of mistake if I tried. But I look down at that napkin, and I would swear on my mother that it&#39;s accurate. I feel attacked, even now, when you say it isn&#39;t. And it&#39;s all the more upsetting when you explain //why// it&#39;s wrong. 

**Director Ball, Site-116:** It&#39;s moving testimony, but it can&#39;t account for why you did this in such a hurry. If you had taken the time, is it not true you would&#39;ve used a calculator rather than a napkin, which, mind you, is the source of a known anomaly?

**Petri:** I can say with certainty that I had never heard of this anomaly before yesterday. But sir, let me get to my point. I don&#39;t think the napkin //is// the source of the anomaly. I think it&#39;s me.

**Ball:** I&#39;m sorry, you?

**Petri:** August 11, 1983. 

**Ball:** The first instance of SCP-7705, yes, it&#39;s on the file here.

**Petri:** Sir, that&#39;s my date of birth.

**Ball:** I&#39;d hardly call that conclusive. Independent of the source, I&#39;d still like to know why you would take a shortcut on such a critical safety measure.

**Petri:** It&#39;s not, as I said before, a shortcut, this is something //anyone//, even without a math degree, should be able to do in a hurry.

**Ball:** Well, this has been very interesting, but the idea of you being a harmless little SCP yourself, who needs our help rather than our ire, is just a tad convenient, don&#39;t you think?

**05P:** Director, if you believe Dr. Petri is acting in malice please express your opinion privately. 

**Ball:** I&#39;m gonna ask for a motion to be done with this nonsense and call a verdict now. Overseer, please call for a motion.

**05P:** Does anyone object to the rendering of a verdict?

//Silence.//

**05P:** Members of the court, please record your votes electronically.

//Beeping heard. Petri looks exhausted and resigned.//

**05P:** By unanimous verdict, Dr. Petri is found responsible for the August 22 incident and is to be held in detention at Site-79 for a period of thirty-three months, as well as to pay-

**Petri:** WAIT!

**05P:** Does the offender wish to deliver an apology?

**Petri:** No, I wish to admit that I had a bit of mustard on my face from lunch, I hope that did not undermine the credibility of my testimony.

//Most members of the court appear irritated by Petri&#39;s stalling. 05P resumes scribbling calculations of the financial penalty.//

**05P:** Total fines will accumulate to, uh- 

//Petri lifts a piece of paper from his dossier and wipes the mustard off his upper lip with it, using the paper as a napkin.//

**05P:** -ninety-six cents.

**Belkova:** I&#39;m sorry, what?

//All members of the court become agitated and vehemently argue the total calculated on paper, now subject to SCP-7705. Further attempts by other members also fail, spare for Belkova, who uses a digital spreadsheet. Belkova&#39;s voice is drowned out. All members have turned their attention from Dr. Petri.//

**Petri [Muttering softly to themself]:** What kind of //idiot// would do math on a napkin...

//Dr. Petri exits the room unobstructed, with a wry smile on their face.//

SCP-7705 is now uncontained, and Dr. Petri&#39;s whereabouts are unknown. Preparations are underway to explain the sudden obsolescence of ordinary printer paper in mathematics.
