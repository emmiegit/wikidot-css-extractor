The breaking of the veil has led to many opportunities for anomalous individuals to create works of television without fear of containment by us or any other organization. With that being said it&#39;s still imperative that we monitor and document these programs for anything that could possibly cause harm to the general public.

The document you see before you contains a collection of excerpts of televised programs and advertisements created by anomalous groups and individuals that have been documented by our department. When adding a new addition to the system please follow the provided format.
