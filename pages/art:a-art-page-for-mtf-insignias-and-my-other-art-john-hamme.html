Hey, I&#39;m John Hammerton, or call me by my discord. You found my art page. All I&#39;m doing here is Posting MTF insignias. I make Insignias for fun, not for a job or anything. Feel free to use them if you want. Just make sure you say I made it. 

If you want to contact me, I&#39;m usually open on discord, my username is thedoctor7902. If you have questions or want help with anything, just DM me.

//**PLEASE NOTE, IM NEW TO THIS STUFF SO DONT SHOOT ME FOR SCREWING UP**//

[[collapsible show=&#34;Stuff that can be found&#34; hide=&#34;You Found Some Stuff&#34;]]
This serves for explaining each tab.

**Mainline**: I put Insignias that either are used for a main/Additional MTF, //OR// Used to be.

**New**: This is where I post Insignias for MTF that don&#39;t have one. also, here if I made it for an additional MTF that need an Insignia.

**Redone**: If I rework someone&#39;s thing or if I make a new OG insignia for a MTF that has one, it goes here.

**Non-MTF**: I put insignias here that don&#39;t have a MTF to them. They are Free use. just mention my name with it.

**//CREDIT TO TEAM//**

[[*user coyo_coya]], For letting me post Ouro-1 on here.
[[*user Woedenaz]], For the Theme. 
[[*user Jerden]], For helping me understanding how the MTF insignia system works.
People who suggested stuff, Thanks.

Sigma-5: //; DROP TABLE taskforces â€”//

This was a old thing I made. Well not this. I had a older more doll one. I sharpened it and have been waiting to get it on the wiki main. And it happened.

Upsilon-23: &#34;Art Critics&#34;

Cicada suggested it a while back, now back then I didn&#39;t have an idea or plan for Upsilon-23. After it came to the MTF list, I had an idea for it. Now I don&#39;t remember the SCP exactly, but I based the insignia off of it.

Delta-4: &#34;Minutemen

I was looking for Stuff to make and I came across Delta-4, I was trying out the text feature on IBISPAINT.EXE sadly it was replaced. :/

[[image Delta-4.png]]

------

Theta-5: &#34;The Bigger Boat&#34;

Used to be Theta-5&#39;s insignia and the first one I made.
It was later removed from Theta-5, but it shall rest as my first Insignia.
[[image Theta-5.png]]

[[tab New]]

Beta-8: &#34;Beta Eight Than Never&#34;

So I was gonna start this a while ago but I didn&#39;t have the motivation. But I finished finally.

[[image Beta8.png]]

------

Gamma-1: &#34;Search and Destroy&#34;

Can&#39;t say much... I just made it...
[[image Gamma-1.png]]

------

Delta-45: &#34;Rolling Thunder&#34;

HEY, I updated this one. See redone for why.
[[image Delta-45_new.png]]

------

Nu-9: &#34;Null Chasers&#34;

I was scrolling through the hundreds to thousands of MTF. I found Nu-9. And so I made there insignia a pattern, almost...

[[image Nu-9.png]]

------

Tau-4: &#34;Water, Water, Everywhere&#34;

Was scrolling again through the comprehensive list of MTF and found Tau-4. And so this was born.
[[image Tau-4.png]]

------

Psi-6: &#34;Psly Dogs&#34;

So same as Delta-45, it has been updated. And I love the new look I gave it. Now it doesn&#39;t look like a fox some what
[[image new_Psi-6.png]]

------

Omega-31: &#34;Sticky Fingers&#34;

First, I tried a box that was held by tentacles but that didn&#39;t really work. so, I made this through suggestions.
[[image Omega-31.png]]

------

Titan-1: &#34;Off The Books&#34;

You get the mojo. This was mostly suggested to change by [[*user Jerden]]. He has yet to say it will work 
[[image new_Titan-1.png]]



[[/tab]]
[[tab Redone]]

Ouro-1: &#34;Eye-Gear&#34;

Made by Coyo_coya, he posted in MAST his insignia for a W.I.P MTF he was making. I sharpened his insignia for him. Top is the original version; bottom is my version.

[[=image http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/art:a-art-page-for-mtf-insignias-and-my-other-art-john-hamme/Old_Ouro-1.png]]

------

[[image Ouro-1.png]]

------

Delta-45: &#34;Rolling Thunder&#34;

So Jerden was looking over the insignias. He said Delta-45 was a bit rough so I smoothed some of it out and made it more on par with the rolling part. Top will be the old. Bottom will be new.

[[image Delta-45.png]]

------

[[image Delta-45_new.png]]

------

Psi-6: &#34;Psly Dogs

So I was suggesting that it would look better with 3 eyes. Id did. Old top new bottom

[[image Psi-6.png]]

------

[[image new_Psi-6.png]]

------

Titan-1: &#34;Off the Books&#34;

Again this was from suggested of Jerden. He has yet to see this.
