**Special Containment Procedures:** No direct containment procedures for SCP-7027 have been authorized.[[footnote]] The **Cernunnos**-class designates an anomaly for which theoretical containment procedures exist but cannot be carried out for logistical or ethical reasons. [[/footnote]] For details regarding theoretical containment methods, see Ethics Committee Ruling 7027/CRS. As of 2016, the creation of practicable containment procedures for SCP-7027 has been elevated to Foundation priority level AMIDA/5.

The effects of SCP-7027 are not yet significant enough in scale to threaten the maintenance of the Veil. Should events progress to the point that this is no longer the case, portions of Ethics Committee Ruling 7027/CRS will be revisited with the threat posed to normalcy in mind.

All known SCP-7027 instances have been placed under discreet 24-hour surveillance. Under no circumstances is any instance to be accosted by containment personnel or informed of their status.

Any and all national anomalous agencies (e.g.: the British Occult Service, the Abnormal Affairs Management 19th Bureau of the People&#39;s Republic of China, PENTAGRAM) must be prevented from acquiring knowledge of SCP-7027&#39;s existence at all costs. Any transparency agreements with such agencies are to be disregarded in this case due to the risk of further political destabilization.
----
**Description:** SCP-7027 is the collective designation for a group of individuals who are the source of an anomalous semiohazard[[footnote]]A [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5242 semiohazard] is a statement of fact which reasonably should not be true but objectively is. [[/footnote]] defining each instance as the rightful absolute monarch of a particular nation-state. Despite the subjectivity inherent in human constructs of political power, the statement that any given nation possesses an objective ruler has been verified by 100% of anomalous information-generating sources.

SCP-7027 individuals are subdesignated using regional codes. For example, the instance affecting the French Republic is designated SCP-7027-FR. A full list of subdesignations is available upon request.

The mantle of SCP-7027 may be transferred from person to person through several vectors. Known transmission vectors for SCP-7027 include, but are not limited to:
[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block
|name=primogeniture.png
|caption=Diagram of inheritance within absolute primogeniture.
|width=250px
]]
* Absolute cognatic primogeniture, i.e.: In the event of SCP-7027&#39;s natural death, its oldest living offspring will inherit the title. [[footnote]]Unlike most historical models of primogeniture, sex of the inheritor is irrelevant.[[/footnote]] For a full briefing on the minutiae of primogeniture laws, consult a member of the SCP-7027 research team; considerable education in this field is required for full comprehension.
* Willful abdication of the title. The precise definition of &#34;willful&#34; is unspecified; however, any form of coercion likely renders this vector inapplicable. Due to the fact that any current SCP-7027 instance is likely unaware of their status, this is considered highly improbable in the modern age.
* Termination of an SCP-7027 instance. In this case, the mantle of SCP-7027 will transfer to its killer.
This list consists only of vectors that are universally agreed to exist by the SCP-7027 research team; several further additions are pending debate.

The primary outward effect of SCP-7027 is an inexorable process of entropy affecting all regional political systems in which it does not hold autocratic control. All governmental organizations which are not commanded by the local SCP-7027 instance will become increasingly ineffective and incoherent, and eventually collapse due to either internal or external forces. This process may become slower as SCP-7027&#39;s proximity to power increases, but cannot be totally arrested by any means other than absolute autocracy.

Of note is the fact that 99.3% of SCP-7027 instances whose identity is known have no affiliation whatsoever with the national government of their country of origin.[[footnote]]Exceptions include SCP-7027-DMK, who occupies a minor clerical position within the Kingdom of Denmark, and SCP-7027-MX, who is currently seated on a regional council as part of the Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities in Chiapas, Mexico.[[/footnote]] While a number of notable historical monarchs are suspected of having been SCP-7027 instances, circumstances such as democratization, appointment of technically illegitimate heirs, and assassinations have resulted in no modern instance acting as their nation&#39;s head of state, or indeed possessing almost any political power. This disconnect results in long-term global political instability, and unless containment is achieved, eventual collapse.

Historical records suggest that past SCP-7027 instances possessed additional anomalous capabilities derived from their relationship to power. An instance placed in a position of autocracy would likely exert significant influence over local reality within their nation. Due to the difficulty inherent in differentiating between genuine historical reports and state propaganda efforts, the exact nature of this influence, in particular whether an empowered instance would function as a consciously reality-manipulating entity, is unknown.

All known SCP-7027 instances are likely unaware of their nature at present, as most are heavily distanced from current or historical monarchies. Maintenance of this ignorance is required, as a coalition of self-aware instances (or even a single politically inclined one) would be highly disruptive of existing sub-Veil power structures.

**Addendum 01:** Ethics Committee Decision

The following is a release from the Foundation Ethics Committee relating to several distinct containment proposals put forward by the Experimental Containment Research Group (ECRG).

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
[[=]]
**ETHICS COMMITTEE RULING 7027/CRS**
[[/=]]

The matter of SCP-7027 presents an ethical challenge in that it possesses one and only one built-in method of containment, the morality and feasibility of which is highly questionable. Specifically, no method of mitigating its effects has been found other than promoting any and all of its instances to nigh-autocratic control over their national governments.

The argument in favor of such a measure largely consists of the fact that all existing national organizations on Earth will eventually be destroyed by SCP-7027 if it is not instituted. This eventuality, while disastrous, appears to grant the Foundation a considerable amount of time to construct an alternative solution, with only minor systemic failures yet observed.

The arguments against this measure, meanwhile, are numerous and compelling. The extent of the reality-bending effects of SCP-7027 is at present unknown, and subjecting thousands of civilians to a national takeover by a reality-manipulating entity of unknown power certainly does not seem like containment or protection. Even should the anomalous capabilities of an empowered instance be minimal, subversion of civilian democracy on this scale carries obvious practical and moral problems.

Some have suggested that the risk of creating a global ruling caste of reality-benders might be mitigated by calculated termination of SCP-7027 instances by specifically-chosen candidates under Foundation control. This, however, has been deemed unacceptable. SCP-7027 instances have committed no crime other than having the fortune to be born to the right (or wrong) parents. While the Committee submits to the inherent moral compromise of containing blameless anomalies, systemic termination is presently unacceptable, especially as they pose no risk to global containment or normalcy maintenance.

In short, the Ethics Committee cannot at present accept any permanent containment procedures for SCP-7027, and as such recommends it be classified as **Cernunnos** until an alternative solution is reached.
[[/div]]

This decision is not closed, and may be revisited at any time should circumstances change considerably.

{{**Welcome, Overseer.**}}

[[&lt;]]
[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block
|name=entropy.png
|caption=Estimated Foundation containment integrity since 1965.
|width=100%
]]
Recent research conducted by the containment team has proven to the satisfaction of the O5 Council that the SCP Foundation as an organization is affected by SCP-7027. As the Foundation is not a nation-state, it possesses no related SCP-7027 instance, and the structural entropic effect is slightly less pronounced than in actual governments (though still apparently inexorable). Researchers hypothesize that the Foundation is considered a form of world government by the semiohazard that controls SCP-7027.

Current projections estimate that the entropic effect of SCP-7027 will reduce global containment integrity to unacceptable levels by 204█. If no action is taken, total existence failure on the part of the Foundation will occur by 20██.

Following the release of this data, the Overseer Council has composed an operation, codenamed Project DYNASTY, in order to contain SCP-7027 and protect the Foundation. Overwatch personnel are required to familiarize themselves with the following document.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
[[=]]
**OVERWATCH COMMAND INTERNAL DOCUMENT**
**Project DYNASTY**
[[/=]]

As SCP-7027&#39;s effects on global politics have become more pronounced, the Ethics Committee has become increasingly accepting of extreme containment measures. However, recent revelations have rendered the majority of the ECRG&#39;s proposals obsolete. The Foundation itself is threatened by illegitimacy in the eyes of the universe, and a new method of containment is necessary. There is no known way to subvert the apparent natural law that all people and governments must be ruled by SCP-7027 or eventually cease to exist.

Therefore, it is the opinion of the Overseer Council that SCP-7027 must be promoted to a position of singular authority within the SCP Foundation, so as to ensure its continued existence.

Appointing a single preexisting SCP-7027 instance to autocracy has been deemed unacceptable by the Council, and may in fact be insufficient to protect an international organization such as the Foundation. To this end, the Council will select an individual unrelated to SCP-7027 by unanimous vote, who will be granted the newly-established position of Foundation Administrator.

The newly-established Applied Task Force Sigma-0 (&#34;Knights of Temerant&#34;) will be dispatched to detain a single SCP-7027 instance and transport it to Overwatch Site-01. Upon arrival, it will be restrained, sedated, and screened for cognitohazardous or infohazardous vectors. After security is ensured, the instance will be terminated by gunshot, performed exclusively by the Administrator.

This process will repeat until all extant SCP-7027 instances have been decommissioned and their anomalous status transferred to the Administrator of the Foundation.

Following the conclusion of Project DYNASTY, SCP-7027 will be reclassified as **Radix** (an anomaly which has been integrated into the Foundation&#39;s structure) and all operations may continue as normal.

Project DYNASTY allows the Council to protect both the world at large and the Foundation from the effects of SCP-7027. As the Foundation counts as a world government, placing an instance at the head of the Foundation is expected to mitigate the entropy suffered by sub-Veil national organizations. In addition, the Administrator will be able to utilize the anomalous capabilities granted to empowered SCP-7027 instances for the betterment of the Foundation and the course of humanity.

The Ethics Committee is considered likely to vote in favor of this proposal, due primarily to the danger posed to the integrity of the Foundation. In the event that the Committee appears on trajectory to vote against it, various contingencies to ensure a positive outcome have been approved.

Dissenters within the Committee will likely cite the popular adage: [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ethics-committee-orientation &#34;The Foundation does not rule the world. The Foundation serves the world.&#34;] In the considered opinion of the Council, this represents a shortsighted adherence to an outdated doctrine. This is not the choice presented to the Foundation - it is to rule the world, or to cease to exist. SCP-7027 states beyond doubt that rule is the natural state of humankind, and to deny this law is to invite catastrophe and inevitable decay. To refuse this fact on the basis of an idealistic attachment to subservience would be antithetical to our mission.

The Foundation will rule the world, because we must.
