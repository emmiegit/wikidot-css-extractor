**Item #:** SCP-XXXX

**Object Class:** Neutralised

**Special Containment Procedures:** 

SCP-XXXX was a reality anchor named Dr. Viktoralai Amity Lost. No more containment will be needed as of tomorrow. 

**Description:** 

SCP-XXXX, the designation of reality anchor Viktoralai Amity Lost, was a member of the Research Department at Site 404. During their employment, SCP-XXXX never really had a place there, and failed to produce meaningful work that extended beyond the use of their anomalous traits. After seven years of employment with limited results, SCP-XXXX was ordered for termination. 

As of 1.17.2024, SCP-XXXX has been administered with a 1500ml dosage of Prozac, causing SCP-XXXX to suffer an overdose. SCP-XXXX will be neutralised within the next 24 hours. 

**Addendum:**

&gt; Hey Ezekiah. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll get to this one before tomorrow but if you do, I guess I just wanted to record it down somewhere. There&#39;s been a debate for whether I should get an SCP designation for a while, so anyway, here&#39;s that. I should probably have included some like, hume graphs or something, but.. I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s not really going to matter, right? Uh,  I guess I should say I&#39;m sorry. Thanks for helping me clean up the ceiling tiles that fell after the Reality Breach last week. You&#39;re a good person.
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#39;t think a lot of people here really care about me. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever really fix that, and I&#39;ve made peace with that. But I don&#39;t want to be miserable. I don&#39;t hate my job. I just hate my life. Everyone here always is saying that it&#39;s annoying how down on myself I am, and I do want to change that. After thinking it over I think this is the right decision. I feel like I&#39;ll be happier with myself if I&#39;m not here. I don&#39;t think I can change as a person and become something I like, so I&#39;m deciding to save myself and others the grief of watching me fail. 
&gt; 
&gt; 63% of Foundation Personnel attempt suicide at some point within the first ten years of their career. Hopefully, my death will at least bump up the number. That way, there can eventually be some attention around it. I don&#39;t think I matter, but maybe the number does. There //are// people who are worth saving, and I really hope that there&#39;s more of an effort in the future to do so.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;ve left a file on my desk with all the extra information for what to do after I&#39;m officially dead. I&#39;ve been working on it for 7 months, so it hopefully should be in-depth enough. 
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m sending an email to Levi after this that will deliver in 12 hours, so they can get my body out. I want to say thank you to Reynolds for giving me a chance here. I&#39;m sorry things didn&#39;t work out. 
&gt; 
&gt; Bye. Thanks for the memories, and cheers.
&gt; 
&gt; - Lost

[BEGIN LOG]

EZEKIAH LENORA: Hello, this is Researcher Lenora. If anyone is online right about now, can someone get down to Dr. Lost&#39;s wing? I just received a note from them that mentions they may be attempting to- um, overdose, in the next few hours. This is an emergency. Please, if anyone can just go check on them. Thank you.

++ **TRANSCRIPT EMAIL SENT BY DIRECTOR EMERALD REYNOLDS, 11:30 PM EST, 1.17.2024**

-----

Staff- 

I wanted to inform everyone that Dr. Viktoralai Amity Lost has been transferred to the Medical Wing after an incident that occured this evening. I&#39;d like to request that anyone who was present or involved refrain from sharing details with other Personnel, for the safety and security of everyone. The Medical department has informed me that Lost will most likely recover fine from this, though we&#39;re still monitoring them. Thank you for the patience and quick-acting of everyone on staff tonight.  

If this situation impacts your current project, please email me ASAP and we can discuss what to do in the meantime. For now, please continue with work as normal, and trust the situation will be handled. 

Thank you,

Emerald Reynolds
Site 404 Director
