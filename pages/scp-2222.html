**Item #:** SCP-2222

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation operatives embedded within ████ (█████ ████████ █████ █████████████) have been relocated and situated upon Orbital Unit-09 under the guise of qualified station personnel. Personnel consists of --four-- three (3) Foundation operatives preliminarily and extensively trained in aerospace engineering, extravehicular activity, confinement and experimentation/analysis for the sole purpose of SCP-2222&#39;s containment. Transmissions originating from ████ are to be intercepted and deterred by Foundation operatives trained in linguistics and vocal interpretations at Command-2.

Hermetic doors composing SCP-2222 are to remain sealed with the exception of testing and/or analysis purposes. No internal interaction is permitted within SCP-2222 during analysis; visual and/or auditory analysis is permitted from SCP-2222&#39;s exterior following manual opening. Testing requires the release of any number of //Rattus rattus// within SCP-2222, the supply of which is currently situated within the Unit laboratory. Emergent entities from within SCP-2222 are to be transferred to a suitable and sterile area in which further testing and analysis regarding resultant behavioural, physical and anomalous characteristics may be conducted prior to termination. Entities are to be terminated via the release of gaseous rodenticides.

Following Incident 2222-REF#209, any indications of fascination or obsession pertaining to SCP-2222 from Unit personnel are to be reported to Command-2, where temporary/permanent replacement of the personnel in question may be administrated. Complete personnel obsession pertaining to SCP-2222 is to result in the immediate isolation of Orbital Unit-09, where Armed Rapid Response Spatial Task Force-01 may be contacted. Additional emergency response forces are to be stationed at Command-2, who are to be dispatched in the event of a Unit personnel member becoming obsolete (refer to Exploration III for further details). 

**Description:** SCP-2222 is an airlock composed of two (2) opaque hermetic plug doors and a cylindrical (3.6 m in diameter) chamber within ████ ████████-█ space station (designated Orbital Unit-09). --Attempts to internally survey SCP-2222 during the closure of both hermetic doors such as placing interior surveillance devices, pressure sensors or radios within the chamber have failed due to apparent malfunction. As a result, no means of interior observation within SCP-2222 are possible, excluding reopening via electronic control.-- **REVISION:** ██/██/████ - Refer to Incident 2222REF#209 for further information.

Organisms entering SCP-2222 precipitate immediate anomalous effects. Upon entrance from Orbital Unit-09&#39;s interior, the inner hermetic door will seal and entrap the organism. SCP-2222 will remain sealed for approximately three (3) minutes prior to the door reopening and the organism re-emerging. Attempts to manually open either hermetic door during this period invariably fail. Entry to within SCP-2222 from Orbital Unit-09&#39;s spatial exterior is yet to be conducted. 

Upon re-emergence, organisms exhibit complete organic and structural eversion. Organisms remain alive despite theoretically fatal alterations to their physical forms. Affected human subjects are capable of communication through vocalising individual words in reverse; as observed within Incident 2222-01, subjects appear physically incapable of vocalising individual words in standard intelligible format unless prompted to do so. As a result, immediate communication has proven impossible due to incomprehension. Despite this, reverse playback of recorded interviews have successfully determined the meaning of individual vocalisations. Individual vocalisations from sentient organisms such as //Rattus rattus// also exhibit this impairment.

**Incident 2222-01:** ██/██/████: Interview with the first affected Foundation subject following SCP-2222&#39;s initial acquisition (refer to Document-2222-667DL for further details). Subject is ████ ██████████, a former Level 4 operative with qualifications in engineering. Physical alterations were first noted following ████ ██████████&#39;s interaction and accidental entrapment within SCP-2222 during interior analysis. Individual vocalisations from ████ ██████████ are reversed for the purpose of comprehension. It is to be of note that Dr. █████ was unable to comprehend ████ ██████████ during the interview. Original unaltered audial documentation may be found here:

[[include :snippets:html5player

|url=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-2222/InterviewWitMessedUpTing2.mp3]]

&gt; **Interviewed:** ████ ██████████
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. █████
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████:** What happened in the airlock?
&gt; 
&gt; **████ ██████████:** Dazzling. Blinding. Hurt.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████:** Did you notice anything unusual?
&gt; 
&gt; **████ ██████████:** //[Shakes head]// Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████:** Right. What turned you into this?
&gt; 
&gt; **████ ██████████:** Things. Came. Ripped. Stabbed. Laughed.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████:** Did you hear anything?
&gt; 
&gt; **████ ██████████:** Yes. Laughter. Said. Flawed. Deficient. Substandard. Weak.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████:** Do you remember who you are?
&gt; 
&gt; **████ ██████████:** Yes. ████.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████:** Can you say your name backwards for me?
&gt; 
&gt; **████ ██████████:** ████ //[sic]//.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████:** Thanks. Did anything else anomalous happen?
&gt; 
&gt; **████ ██████████:** Yes. Took. Me. Sun. Fire. Hurt. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████:** Are you in pain?
&gt; 
&gt; **████ ██████████:** Hurt.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████:** Right. One last question before I put you out of your misery. Were there any entities \
within the airlock during your exposure?
&gt; 
&gt; **████ ██████████:** Yes. Said. Already. Unearthly. Extra- //[Collapses due to apparent exhaustion]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████:** Oh, God- Uh, Okay, crew. Get him up. Take him to the lab for a final run-down before shooting him off.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent ████████:** He&#39;s saying something, sir.
&gt; 
&gt; **████ ██████████:** Thank. Love. Space. //[Enters unconsciousness]//
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**

████ ██████████ was promptly terminated prior to spatial release from a separate airlock. It is to be of note that ████ ██████████&#39;s interaction with SCP-2222 was unauthorised.

**Addendum 2222-01:** ██/██/████: Directly five (5) minutes following Incident 2222-01. Posthumous analysis and dissection of ████ ██████████&#39;s cadaver revealed intricate textual engravings on epidermal layers. Additionally, several lacerations and bruising on said layers indicated forced eversion originating from the genital area. Content of engravings are as follows:

&gt; taht saw nuf
&gt; retteb naht stnedor
&gt; on erom star
&gt; nam si tahw ew tnaw
&gt; ohw si txen?

Investigations regarding SCP-2222&#39;s anomalous effects are to be resumed by unit personnel. Reclassified as sapient on ██/██/███. 

**Addendum 2222-02:** Following events documented in the aforementioned incident, Command-2 have submitted the formal request for Unit personnel to receive monthly examinations and counselling through telecommunication pertaining to psychological wellbeing. 

//Denied. Preliminary training should suffice. Should psychological issues become apparent and then persist, I will personally administrate the replacement of the personnel in question.// - O5-█.

**Incident 2222-REF#209:** The following events occurred between the dates of ██/██/████ and ██/██/████ following successful interior surveillance within SCP-2222 after handheld digital cameras within the chamber exhibited non-malfunction. The preceding information thus warranted inclusion and exploration within SCP-2222, conducted by seven (7) D-Class personnel resituated upon Orbital Unit-09 with preliminary sedation administrated beforehand, alongside five (5) Level 4-5 Foundation operatives with the responsibility of Unit maintenance and safety, alongside communication with D-Class personnel. Current Unit personnel were granted temporary leave, with long-term signal failure occurring across all ████ so as to maintain the undetectability of the response force relocating the personnel. It is to be of note that D-Class personnel were unaware of SCP-2222&#39;s anomalous effects prior to their exposure to SCP-2222.

timecodes pertaining to SCP-2222&#39;s interior/exterior surveillance displayed the date and time as 1616 GMT on 23/0█/20██. \

amorphous, roughly linear stellar entity resembling a nebula \
also visible, violet in colouration. D-02928 is observed to emerge from SCP-2222&#39;s exterior and enter SCP-2222 despite theoretically \
fatal spatial conditions. D-02928 hastily reacquires the camera before addressing Unit command in person]//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-02928:** You see that?
&gt; **Agent White:** God. Yes, we see it. What is it?
&gt; **D-02928:** It&#39;s- It&#39;s... Look, they&#39;re preparing. That&#39;s why they haven&#39;t killed me. I&#39;ll explain once I get out.
&gt; **Agent White:** I&#39;m sorry? No, you&#39;ll explain now.

//D-02928 later emerged from SCP-2222 with no resultant physical impairments. However, D-02928 exhibited complete incapability of oral, written or other forms of communication with other personnel, disregarding them completely. D-02928 was promptly transported to Orbital Unit-09&#39;s temporary D-Class housing area, in which he spent the remainder of his accompaniment with Unit personnel before relocation to Sector-19. A total of nine (9) photographs were taken during D-02928&#39;s exposure to SCP-2222, eight (8) of which exhibit corruption as a result of hardware damage. The remaining photograph is included below://

//D-90123 is placed within SCP-2222 upon instruction, with identical equipment as mentioned beforehand. It is to be of note that
D-90123 exhibited a heightened fascination with SCP-2222, with said fascination increasing exponentially following the effects of
SCP-2222 on her predecessors; it is to be of note that D-90123 was not informed of the current whereabouts of said predecessors,
excluding D-02928 (Refer to exploration III for further details). D-90123&#39;s fascination with SCP-2222 was additionally shared with D-46400 (refer to Exploration VI for further details), who exhibited a milder form of the aforementioned fascination. It is to be of additional note that D-90123&#39;s vocabulary appeared to increase significantly during her exposure to SCP-2222.//

&gt; **O5-█:** In that case, D-90123, what is SCP-2222?
&gt; **D-90123:** SCP-2222 is an airlock composed of two opaque hermetic plug doors and a cylindrical 4.6 metre chamber within \
████ ████████-█ space station, designated Orbital Unit-09. Attempts to internally survey-

precise reiteration. What you didn&#39;t allow me to do, [DATA EXPUNGED], was to finish. So please, do allow me to restate.

//Similarly to D-72892, D-90123 re-emerged as a disarrayed mass of charred and blackened flesh, with the only notable deviation// //being incapability of locomotion.

The remains of affected temporary Unit personnel were incinerated prior to spatial release, and D-73714 was detained prior to termination due to lethal hostility and unauthorised actions. D-12935 was detained by Task Force personnel, who escaped momentary restraint and voluntarily entered SCP-2222 following apparent abrupt obsession with the airlock, similar to the fascination observed with D-46400 and D-90123, equipping himself with D-73714&#39;s disused camera setup (refer to Exploration VII for further details).//

Do you see it?

Meschk-Mernanschordbtoum-VordhosbnV7.

It&#39;s right there. 

Offspring, we can watch them in perpetuity. We&#39;ll join the millions. Sitting here on this violet cloud. Laughing at the humans. 

Let me give you a brief rundown of what goes on over there, aeons away, on Meschk-Vordhosbn. First, it was plants. That was unstimulating. Then came the ridiculous squealing mammals. Then, finally, there came the first human. We enjoyed humans, so we familiarised ourselves with them, and they sent more. The first of the three new humans were clueless, the fourth was delightful. The fifth was a disappointment despite the fourth&#39;s promise. The sixth was insane. And the seventh is here with us. You&#39;ve heard of him. 

They call him 12935. 

He hates it here.

Sound appealing?

Good. You must appreciate the work that goes into this. It&#39;s a hard job to organise. It&#39;s only a mere team of four, did you know? Who knows how far they travelled to achieve this. I hope you&#39;ll look up to them someday.

Offspring, we too can laugh.

We can be entertained. We can feast our optic lobes on flocks after flocks of human astronauts, turned inside-out, having their vocal comprehensions reversed so that we can split our sides.

We can watch their bloodied remains get taken to Epmn where they&#39;ll be singed, semi-torrefied, burned like anthropoid hogs on a spit. Because it&#39;s hilarious.

Why not?

Exactly.

Sit down, offspring. This is quality entertainment.
