**Item #:** SCP-7979

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7979 is to be kept within site 206 in a containment cell measuring 2.5 by 2.5 meters. The cell is to be made of tungsten carbide with 1 meter thick walls to prevent SCP-7979 from breaching containment. Staff members who enter the containment chamber must cover their entire body in clothing at least 2 centimeters thick. In case of containment breach site 206 must be flooded with a light sedative and a search team must be dispatched to find SCP-7979 before the sedative wears off. A active team of foundation staff must be present in the town of Eden Mills constantly to monitor if any additional instances of SCP-7979 appear.




**Description:** SCP-7979 is an anomalous female //Culex pipiens//, the common house mosquito. SCP-7444 was first discovered after the Foundation received a large portion of reports detailing strange deaths caused by bug bites within the town of Eden Mills, Ontario. In response to this the SCP Foundation mobilized a team of Mobile Task Force Alpha-15 &#34;the Exterminators&#34;, the team consisted of agent Acqua, agent Zivkovic, agent Moon, agent Bloodgood and the mission was overseen by Dr. Euclides Ek remotely. Video and audio logs of the team are the primary source of research done upon SCP-7979 as well as interviews conducted upon bite victims and research conducted by Dr. Marie Ek. After further study it has been determined that SCP-7979 has a longer lifespan than the rest of its species.


**Addendum-03:**

&gt; **Interview-03.**
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Marie Ek
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewee:** James Arsenault
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Marie Ek:** Hello James, would you like to tell me about the events that transpired on August 4th for me?
&gt; 
&gt; **James Arsenault:** Ah, yes I can ma&#39;am. You see that day was the perfect day for hunting, and so I went hunting. Then near midday I heard the huge crack and I saw it, the biggest bear I had ever seen, it must have been twice my size and rippling with muscles, and of course I wanted to bring it back to me buddies at home. So of course I shot at it, except I missed! And that made it mad and it started coming for me, I was terrified, I redd-
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marie Ek:** This is something that definitely happened but that&#39;s not what I&#39;m here for, tell me about your brother, Ben.
&gt; 
&gt; //a short silence breaks the interview//
&gt; 
&gt; **James Arsenault:** Ben, yeah apparently he got sick or something when I left hunting. I don&#39;t really know what it was but he said he was unable to go hunting and so I went by myself. When I got back he had been taken to the hospital where he, passed away.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marie Ek:** Was there any strange things that happened before then?
&gt; 
&gt; James Arsenault: Now that I think of it I did go hunting with Ben the day before. While we were hunting he acted all weird. He started complaining about some weird itch nonstop and would always scratch at this one spot on his arm. It was also this nasty black colour, he also said something like a bug bit him.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marie Ek:** So where was it that you went hunting?
&gt; 
&gt; **James Arsenault:** The woods just &#39;round the town.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marie Ek:** Thank you for your time James.
&gt; 
&gt; **James Arsenault:** Wait wait wait what&#39;re you doing with that needle, don&#39;t y&#39;know that it ca-

This interview showed the standard response to the majority of interviews and therefore the remainder of the interviews will not be included within this file.

**Addendum-09:**

&gt; **Task Force Alpha-15 Video Log-01**
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Moon:** Alright so, what were we looking for again doc?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Euclides Ek:** We have no physical description of the entity other then that it&#39;s likely an insect.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Acqua:** So we&#39;re supposed to find a bug in like 50 square kilometers?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Zivkovic:** Maybe something more like 10.
&gt; 
&gt; Agent Acqua: That&#39;s still a little too much
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Moon:** Team, just focus on the mission.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Bloodgood:** I agree, let&#39;s just try to get it, we were trained to handle things like this.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Bloodgood:** Yup, let&#39;s get moving.
&gt; 
&gt; //The remainder of the video has no useful content//

**Addendum-40**

Due to the uneventful nature of the following video logs the written mission logs will be utilized instead as a summary of the missions events. Video logs 02-39 will not be included within this file.

**Mission Logs**

**Mission Log, Agent moon: Day 1**
I think I&#39;m gonna start out by just introducing the team we&#39;ve go here. First there&#39;s me, Sybil Moon. Then we have John Acqua, Georgie Zivkovic and Mario Bloodgood. Next would naturally be my thoughts on the mission and I&#39;ll be honest it&#39;s not good. We are looking for an anomaly no one has actually seen so I&#39;m not expecting much.

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 2**
Well what&#39;d we expect. Nothing, absolutely nothing. Since when did the foundation think just walking around would find it. I hope we do something productive tomorrow.

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 3**
Well we took another stroll. I guess it could be nice and calm out in nature if John could just stop complaining.

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 4**
I think I saw a deer today, no one believes me though.

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 5**
Today we learned that Georgie&#39;s favourite bird is the raven.

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 6**
Mario just told the best joke I&#39;ve ever heard. But don&#39;t think I&#39;ll tell you, no, I&#39;m a greedy Bitch.

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 7**
At least I&#39;m not a new voice for those red shits but this is pretty dull.

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 8**
I overheard Georgie and Dr. Euclides have a lengthy argument over the meaning of puns. Why can&#39;t he be like this on missions?

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 12**
I forgot to keep up with these logs for the past 4 days. Oops! Well anyways today&#39;s a momentous day! The nerds back at the foundation decided we&#39;d try something else! We&#39;re going in with infrared goggles because they think it may be invisible.

I got too excited this morning. Nothing.

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 13**
We&#39;re trying it again, Georgie&#39;s feeling pretty hopeful and I&#39;m trying to share his optimism, well let&#39;s see what&#39;ll happen.

Yeah, it&#39;s nothing. I think I&#39;ll take the team to a local bar to cheer us all up tomorrow.

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 14**
So we went out for a few drinks and all so that I could raise our morale. Well it was a good idea and on any other day it would be a great morale boost. But nooooo, John had to start a fight. I don&#39;t quite remember how it happened, I think I got a little drunk but he sent someone to the hospital, we won&#39;t be doing anything for a few days. Thanks a lot John.

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 20**
Well we&#39;re back at it. Another hike through forest, we&#39;re trying the heat goggles yet again. I&#39;m jealous John got to punch something.

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 21**
Dr. E is appealing for some &#34;reinforcements&#34;. Mostly just some sort of areal views. He thought maybe it would help but we&#39;ll never know since it was denied.

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 22**
Mario seems to have become a bit of a leader around here lately

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 23**
I&#39;m bored

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 26**
I&#39;m still bored, Georgie agrees

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 30**
Guess what! I&#39;m bored.

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 34**
Well, we&#39;re trying something new! We will be placing reality anchors around the forests as the newest theory is that it&#39;s a reality warper. So if we have reality anchors around it it could possibly show itself.

Yup, nothing. I&#39;m so booooooored

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 36**
We saw a moose! We all saw a moose! I&#39;ve never seen one before and it had the coolest antlers!

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 37**
Mario&#39;s trying to organize something for us to do so we can be not bored. I hoped he learned from my mistake.

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 38**
Mario&#39;s organizing game nights, every week on Wednesday starting today. He&#39;s being a bit dangerous and chose Uno, I hope we don&#39;t kill each other.

Hey folk I&#39;m back and no one died! Plus I even won, suck it shit heads!

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 40**
The lights in our living room flickered creepily all day. I no longer feel safe and I have no idea why. No I do, it&#39;s the lights.

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 43**
I saw a goose, I see &#39;em everyday but this one felt special. No clue why, it just did.

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 45**
It&#39;s game day again! Gonna whoop everyone&#39;s asses at the Settlers of Katan.

I&#39;m back and Mario beat me so bad I couldn&#39;t get back up afterwards. At the game, not actually.

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 50**
Agent Moon, could you go see if there&#39;s something anomalous with that tree. Agent Moon, can you see if there&#39;s a third eye on that squirrel. Shut up Georgie, no one finds you funny. Except John, John does.

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 51**
John&#39;s usual complaining has gotten worse, ugh.

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 52**
Today we play monopoly, It&#39;s a game of luck in my opinion. I give myself a 1 in 4 chance of winning.

Well, Georgie won in the usual fashion. Oh well.

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 54**
We had a heated debate about colour theory today and how it applies to the anomaly we are searching for. No meaningful outcome has been determined.

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 56**
We now made a reasonable bit of debate, it was about whether the anomaly we&#39;re looking for is truly some animal or creature or something different. Some of say it&#39;s a disease and other&#39;s think it&#39;s some form of memetic hazard, although the latter feels extremely unlikely.

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 58**
John fell asleep while we were searching the forest, none of us noticed he was gone until we returned. He was furious when he got back. I felt it was funny.

**Mission Log, Agent Moon: Day 59**
Game day, Risk may take a while.

It turns out John is very very good a Risk, who knew.

//The mission logs that have relevance greater then any other form of data end here.//

**Addendum-41:**

&gt; **Task Force Alpha-15 Video Log-41**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Euclides Ek:** Ok guys, we really need to find this thing. 05&#39;s getting impatient and that puts us in some pretty hot water.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Acqua:** Well shit, I&#39;m getting impatient as fuck too. It&#39;s been two full months doc. Two months and nothing except for a ungodly number of mosquito bites.
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; **Agent Moon:** Well there&#39;s something out there, and obviously it doesn&#39;t wanna be found.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Bloodgood:** Well it isn&#39;t invisible, or we would&#39;ve seen it on our heat goggles.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Zivkovic:** I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s a reality warper, that would explain why we haven&#39;t found it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Moon:** No, we used reality anchors already
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Zivkovic:** We only actually used it once.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Acqua:** And not a trace of it
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Bloodgood:** Doc, are you sure it&#39;s a bug and not like a disease
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Euclides Ek:** I&#39;m sure
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Acqua:** Well then, let&#39;s waste another month then. OW!
&gt; 
&gt; //A soft crack can be heard on the video//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Acqua:** Ah shit, I think a bug bit me or something
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Zivkovic:** Hah, maybe the anomaly got to you
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Moon:** Let&#39;s stop messing around
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Zivkovic:** That&#39;s all we&#39;ve been doing looking for this thing
&gt; 
&gt; //The remainder of the video log has no useful data//

After the following events this video log had been reviewed and upon the video being viewed frame by frame the video feed of each agent revealed a single mosquito moving at a calculated 1,214.7 kilometers per hour, which is faster then the speed of sound. The mosquito bit Agent Acqua in the arm in a fraction of a second and flew away before its sonic boom reached the agents.

**Addendum-42**

&gt; **Call Recording-01**
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Moon:** Doc you gotta help us.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Euclides Ek:** What&#39;s going on agent that&#39;s so important to call me at three in the morning?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Zivkovic:** Doc we really need that help!
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Moon:** You&#39;re on speakerphone
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Euclides Ek:** Alright guys, what&#39;s actually going on
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Zivkovic:** we don&#39;t actually know
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Bloodgood:** He woke use all up when he screamed about being naked. Then he screamed something &#39;bout mosquitos and wouldn&#39;t stop swatting at the air. Can&#39;t hear anything we say to him, doesn&#39;t seem to understand when he runs into the walls either. Now he&#39;s just screaming, and hasn&#39;t been up to much else for a few hours.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Zivkovic:** Yeah and he&#39;s gotten this weird black spot yesterday too.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Euclides Ek:** Where&#39;s Acqua?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Moon:** I&#39;ll take you over to him now.
&gt; 
&gt; //Once the phone enters Agent Acqua&#39;s room his screams can be heard loudly//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Euclides Ek:** Alright, so the good news is we&#39;ve found the SCP but we&#39;ll have to take Acqua.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Zivkovic:** Is it that bad?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Moon:** Well let&#39;s just try to stay calm, he&#39;ll turn out fine. At least we found it right?
&gt; 
&gt; //Call Ends//

Agent Acqua died of blood loss before he could be removed and transported to the nearest SCP Foundation site. However after this incident and the foundation reviewed the footage of video-41. A method was developed to identify the locations of SCP-7979. A satellite will be placed above Eden Mills capable of detecting and alerting the SCP Foundation of any supersonic movement. After detection the remaining team members are to approach SCP-7979&#39;s location whilst actively dispensing a weak sedative while approaching the target, when detected the target will to be kept within a tungsten carbide box.

&gt; **Task Force Alpha-15 Video Log-43**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Euclides Ek:** Alright, wake up. It&#39;s the moment we&#39;ve all been waiting for! The satellite&#39;s detected supersonic movement.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Zivkovic:** We&#39;ve been taking rounds for five days already. And it&#39;s fucked up my sleep schedule so much
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Euclides Ek:** And time is of the essence, wake the team up.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Zivkovic:** As you wish, your majesty
&gt; 
&gt; //The sounds of individual agents being woken up can be heard and some time is spent for the agents to arrive at the forest//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Bloodgood:** Alright let&#39;s get it
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Moon:** Ok, start with gas up. We&#39;re heading in
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Euclides Ek:** Remember your guns won&#39;t be much use, learn to rely on the gas and get the SCP in the box as soon as possible.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Moon:** Got it. We&#39;re heading in.
&gt; 
&gt; //The team enters the woods with the sedative gas clinging to them like a dense fog. After a small amount of time an audible crack can be heard and a small object crashes into a tree, agent Moon approaches it, taking out a pair of tweezers and reaches in taking out a mosquito in which he places within the box.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Moon:** So, is that it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Moon:** Yup, that&#39;s it. Now all we gotta do is bring it back to Site 206

**Addendum-44**

__**Test-01 - 02/04/22**__

&gt; **Subject:** D-1289 
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedure:** Allow SCP-7444 to bite D-1289
&gt; 
&gt; **Results:** D-1289 began screaming 5 hours, 31 minutes and 4 seconds after the experiment began. D-1289 was later terminated due to inability to follow orders.
&gt; 
&gt; **Analysis:** Results are inconclusive

After several tests conducted with the same outcome it had been deduced by the constant of blood being drawn that these effects are caused by the breaking of skin around SCP-7979&#39;s bite --causing extreme pain--. The poison that SCP-7979 produces had been determined to be anomalous and designated SCP-7979-A. Within each test the subject would die however the cause of death always varied between a heart attack or blood loss

**Addendum-53**

 __**Test-10 - 12/04/22**__

&gt; **Subjects:** D-1290, D-1301, D-1304
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedure:** Inject D-1290, D-1301 and D-1304 with strong pain killers to observe any additional anomalous properties of the bite. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Results:** D-1290 , D-1301 and D-1304 experienced --vivid hallucinations--. D-1290 died of blood loss 12 minutes and 35 seconds after hallucinations first appeared, D-1301 died of a heart attack 5 minutes and 12 seconds after hallucinations first appeared and D-1304 died of blood loss 17 minutes and 11 seconds after hallucinations first appeared.
&gt; 
&gt; **Analysis:** The contact SCP-7979-A will --cause severe hallucinations in addition to extreme pain--. The hallucinations are always of a alternate world or dimension.

**Addendum-69**

The following is a list of descriptions given by various D-Class personnel on the --hallucinations-- of SCP-7979-A.

&gt; It&#39;s red, this entire place is all red. I think it&#39;s cause of the sky, it looks like some sorta red ocean up there and the sun&#39;s behind it. Oh shit, I... I can&#39;t see anything anymore, there&#39;s too many mosquitos.

&gt; Oh there&#39;s a lake over there. Imma go check it out. This doesn&#39;t look like water, actually I... I think it&#39;s made of blood. This place really gets me! Oh no, here comes a lotta mosquitos.

&gt; Oh, oh shit there&#39;s bodies, dead ones everywhere. They... they look like someone drained the blood outa them. And, there&#39;s a lake with so many bodies floating in it. D... do I recognize the bodies in the water?

&gt; I thought the Foundation was Hell. But I was wrong, this place is actually Hell.

&gt; Everything&#39;s red except the clouds. They look kinda brown... wait, I don&#39;t think those are clouds, their moving too, uh, sharply? Is that even a word? Wait one&#39;s coming over right and it&#39;s... It&#39;s full of mosquitos? I&#39;m not sticking around.

&gt; This place is filled with a constant droning sound, it&#39;s like millions, no billions of small wings are flapping really quickly. And it&#39;s getting louder. I don&#39;t know what it is but all I can tell is that something wicked comes this way.

&gt; It&#39;s raining blood, I must be in hell

&gt; Oh, my clothes, where are my clothes?

With these tests it has been determined that --hallucinations brought on by SCP-7979-A-- will all be in the same place. It also allows us to understand that no items being held or worn can appear --within the hallucination--.

**Addendum-73**

&gt; **Call Recording-04**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marie Ek:** Brother, I just discovered something amazing with that mosquito anomaly.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Euclides Ek:** I&#39;ve never heard you so excited before, what is it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marie Ek:** Remember how I told you it induces hallucinations?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Euclides Ek:** Yeah?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marie Ek:** Well I was wrong, it actually sends a person, in part to a different dimension while leaving their bodies back here! Do you know what this means?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Euclides Ek:** Absolutely not.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marie Ek:** A person can exist in two different realities at once! It completely defies [REDACTED] and can allow people to [REDACTED]!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Euclides Ek:** I still don&#39;t know what that means.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marie Ek:** Whatever, idiot.
&gt; 
&gt; //Call ends//

This phenomenon is to be classified as the matrix effect[[footnote]]A Matrix effect is when someone&#39;s essence or &#34;soul&#34; is transported to a dimension without their body. In material leaving them within our own dimension but in reality leaving them somewhere else as if they have stepped one foot through a door.[[/footnote]]. The dimension is to be classified as SCP-7979-B &#34;Mosquito Hell&#34;.

**Addendum-74**

&gt; **Audio Recording-01**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marie Ek:** Dr. Smith, please tell me how this is even possible. How can this matrix effect even exist?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Smith:** Your machines are wrong, this can&#39;t be possible.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marie Ek:** It is, we ran brain scans several times and it&#39;s not a hallucination and they aren&#39;t processing anything on earth. Their brain waves even suggest having traveled interdimensionally. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Smith:** I&#39;m telling you Marie, it&#39;s not possible
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marie Ek:** Well go do the math for me right now
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Smith:** There&#39;s no need for math Marie, it&#39;s a universal constant that the same matter can not appear twice anywhere. A person can not exist twice.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marie Ek:** Well I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what&#39;s happening here. I think these people are entering mosquito hell metaphysically.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Smith:** I don&#39;t see how that could possibly work
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marie Ek:** Jesus Christ John, we literally have a soul extractor, this could easily work.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Smith:** Perhaps but such a dimension shouldn&#39;t be accessible without having some sort of weird out of body experience.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marie Ek:** Well then that&#39;s how it works. Also do you think that some dimensions can only be accessed via the matrix effect?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Smith:** Who knows, heaven and hell could be like this and death could just be a type of matrix effect. So yes probably.
&gt; //Audio recording ends//

These types of dimensions are to be classified as matrix dimensions[[footnote]]A dimension in which can only be accessed via the matrix effect[[/footnote]]. 

**Addendum-75**

The ethics counsel has just stepped in and has now prohibited the usage of D-Class within experimentation, stating that &#34;Testing has claimed too many lives and for research to continue there must be no human contact with SCP-7979&#34;. I call bullshit, we all know the real reason is [REDACTED].

-Dr. Marie Ek

**Addendum-80**

Well, it&#39;s clear using the lab won&#39;t do anything for me. All of the things I looked to be answered by it just came back as inconclusive. This means we still don&#39;t know how the anomaly can break the sound barrier, we don&#39;t know the molecular compound of SCP-7979-B or how the anomaly can withstand the speeds it travels at without dying. Without D-Class this is just a wild goose chase and I&#39;ll be ending experimentation here until we are allowed to once again use them.

-Dr. Marie Ek
