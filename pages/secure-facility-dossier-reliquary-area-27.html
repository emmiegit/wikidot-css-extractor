Conceived in 1987, the land concealing Reliquary Area-27 was originally purchased from the Canadian government to conceal a minor anomalous phenomenon associated with the Saint Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica. Formerly designated EE-00915, the cathedral was found to have been within the vicinity of several minor reconstructive events, although it remained unaffected according to Foundation exclusionary archives. After a proposal by the then-burgeoning Department of Tactical Theology, the subterranean portion of Reliquary Area-27 was constructed to serve as a secure site for Foundation personnel in the case of a large-scale K-Class Scenario. 

Following construction, Reliquary Area-27 was mainly used as a temporary Foundation housing while being maintained by a skeleton crew of sixty to one-hundred personnel. It wasn&#39;t until the discovery and subsequent utilization of [[[SCP-4531| SCP-4531-2]]] that the site took on the containment of several religious anomalies. As of the time of documentation, Reliquary Area-27 is capable of housing and sustaining up to 2,000 individuals. The site possesses minimal containment chambers, instead transferring most anomalies offsite for containment. All anomalies contained on-site have been chosen due to their benefits in the case of a severe deific crisis. 

Reliquary Area-27 also acts as the headquarters the Department of Tactical Theology. Headed by Yossi Leiner, the department is responsible for assisting in the capture, containment, and potential neutralization of theological anomalies. Members of the department are often deployed to various compounds to act as liaisons. Examples of such deployments include:
* Eventual containment of [[[SCP-4795]]].
* Continued monitoring and containment of [[[SCP-5998]]]. 
* Reintroduction of theological containment methods into standard Foundation operations.
* Investigation and reclassification of [[[SCP-3310]]].
* Provision of various anomalous armaments and weaponry for task force operations. 

[[collapsible show=&#34;► [INPUT LEVEL FOUR SECURITY KEY]&#34; hide=&#34;▼ [ACCESS GRANTED]&#34;]]

Located on the bottom floor[[footnote]]Colloquially referred to as &#34;Cleopatra&#39;s Tomb&#34; by site personnel.[[/footnote]] of the facility is an emergency fail-safe capable of performing a complete decontamination of any theological entities within the site. The fail-safe is only accessible through a secure hatch within the anomalous weapons storage, which can be activated using a passcode possessed by all Level 4 personnel.  

Once the fail-safe is activated, remote Akiva charges built within the site apiaries will detonate, releasing their swarms[[footnote]]Composed of both SCP-5993 colonies and non-anomalous honeybees.[[/footnote]] throughout the site while exciting the swarms through sudden Akiva exposure. Alarm pheromones will be spread throughout the site through concealed ventilation systems, further aggravating the insects. Furthermore, prepared stores of SCP-5993-1 will be pumped into the emergency sprinkler system, nullifying any potential deific threats or phenomenon still located within the compound. 

Following activation, the nearest operational Foundation compound will be notified of the fail-safe&#39;s activation. Stationary Task Force Beta-14 (&#34;Jumping Over Bonfires&#34;) is to be mobilized to aid in the recovery of surviving personnel, retrieval of anomalies, and subsequent beekeeping efforts. Should beekeeping efforts fail, SCP-5993&#39;s host is to be recovered and [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5693|the site is to be considered lost]]].

++ Notable Incidents

----

&gt; Minor Targeted CK-Class Restructuring Scenario 
&gt; Oct. 1997
&gt; 
&gt; Several high-visibility religious locations, including Reliquary Area-27&#39;s cover building, were repeatedly affected by a targeted retrocasual anomaly. This resulted in severe alterations to their structures, namely artistic works and architecture. Historical records of targeted locations were found to lack any record of humankind between the 18th and 19th century. Accounts instead focused on the theological developments of entities referred to as the Beneath, who supposedly lived in large interconnected cave systems. 
&gt; 
&gt; Event Status: Resolved. Publicly accessible records have been altered accordingly to fit the public consensus regarding affected locations. No further mentions of the Beneath in historical accounts have been found, and no evidence of the supposed cave systems have been discovered. 

&gt; Attempted Takeover by Hostile Group of Interest
&gt; Apr. 2002
&gt; 
&gt; Members of GoI-0051 (&#34;[[[saphir-centre|SAPPHIRE]]]&#34;) attempted to raid Reliquary Area-27 in an attempt to procure an unspecified anomalous object. Prior to this, the group was observed transporting several unknown artifacts, although none of these objects were observed during the raid. During the raid, severe damage was inflicted on the site&#39;s exterior, although the subterranean site remained unscathed following standard Foundation lockdown procedures. 
&gt; 
&gt; Event Status: Resolved. SAPPHIRE operatives were subdued and subsequently interrogated. The operatives showed no apparent knowledge of Reliquary Area-27 or any Foundation presence within the area, and were under the impression the cathedral itself housed a powerful religious artifact. Operatives were amnestized, implanted with false memories, and released as to reduce suspicion. 

&gt; Class-IV Religious Neutralization Event 
&gt; Feb. 2014
&gt; 
&gt; For approximately 14 hours, theological containment procedures within the northern hemisphere experienced a sudden decline in effectiveness. This drop was found to correlate with the disturbance of SCP-5998 following a partial collapse of Provisional Outpost-5998 during a storm. Attempts to fix this issue were temporarily delayed by the continued manifestation of Empyrean entities around the corpse. 
&gt; 
&gt; Event Status: Resolved. 45 containment breaches and over 168 casualties have been attributed to this drop in effectiveness. Provisional Outpost-5998 has since been rebuilt and further reinforced against inclimate weather.

[[&lt;]]
&gt; [[[competitive-eschatology-hub|Widespread HK-Class &#34;Deific Subjugation&#34; Event]]]
&gt; Nov. 2020
&gt; 
&gt; An unknown number of demiurgic entities (currently estimated to exceed 250), including those in Foundation containment or otherwise incapacitated, simultaneously attempted to wipe out the human race through individual methods. These entities have since engaged in combat with both one another and humanity at large, resulting in mass fatalities worldwide. 
&gt; 
&gt; Event Status: Currently ongoing. An Omega-class emergency shelter procedure is now in effect pending further contact with allied organizations.
