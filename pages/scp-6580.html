**Special Containment Procedures:** Six guards have been stationed at all entrances to SCP-6580 in order to prevent civilian access into SCP-6580. Should any of the local populace attempt to enter, agents have been issued a cover story[[footnote]] #GH45D: Hazardous Waste Disposal. [[/footnote]] and supplied with Class-A amnestics. Force is applicable should civilians attempt to force entry. 

Observation Post Beta has been established in the former ███████ Building, located one (1) mile south on the same road as SCP-6580 as a means of observing the building for any possible major discrepancies in the near future. 

To mask the shifts of SCP-6580 into Dimension-130, an effect that causes the projection of an abandoned office building has been applied to the outline of SCP-6580 via thaumaturgical symbols, majority of which were used by the previous occupants to hide SCP-6580. Observation Post Beta has been supplied a low-level thaumaturge in the event that the symbols fail by any means. 

Should any civilians enter SCP-6580, immediate escort of the civilians by no more than two guards is to be carried out and amnestics must be applied afterwards. 

Should any civilians enter SCP-6580 and a shift occurs, no action is to be carried out until the reappearance of SCP-6580. Once SCP-6580 has reappeared, no more than three guards are designated to search the immediate area for the civilian(s). If found dead, the body is to be removed and placed outside of SCP-6580, and local police will be informed of the body. If found alive, civilian will be checked, amnesticized, and returned home or to any family or friends in the area with an appropriate cover story. 

Operations to discover the employer(s) of the workers manufacturing SCP-6580-A are ongoing. 

**Description:** SCP-6580 is a two-level industrial warehouse in Everett, Washington, and was formerly owned by ██████████ ███████ ███ before the company filed for bankruptcy and the building was decommissioned. Currently, SCP-6580 will experience random shifts between its location and a hostile dimension thought to be the manifestation of universal psionic power, which has been designated as Dimension-130. Exploration has shown Dimension-130 to be incredibly hostile to human life. SCP-6580 has experienced no other anomalous effects since containment.

SCP-6580-A was a paradrug manufactured in the shape of an oval, purple capsule pill that is ingested orally. Up until the shift that resulted in the discovery of SCP-6580, SCP-6580-A was advertised as &#34;Psiphetamine&#34; and was capable of increasing the abilities of psionically capable individuals. This improvement relates to the control these people have over their abilities, allowing for extended use without causing any initial harm to the mind or body. Gathered information from SCP-6580 revealed that prolonged consumption and exposure to multiple instances at once can cause the majority of individuals to become addicted to SCP-6580-A through purely psionic means, and an overdose can result in the death of the individual and the appearance of an SCP-6580-B instance. As of the SCP-6580 Incident Report, no additional instances have been recovered.

SCP-6580-B instances are psionic manifestations of the most prominent emotion from individual persons. Appearances range drastically, and all instances to date have been hostile. See attached testing logs for additional information on SCP-6580-B instances.

**Discovery:** On December 8th, 2010, a report detailing the sudden appearance of an unknown building was made to the Everett Police Department, which was intercepted by embedded agents from Iota-10 (&#34;Damn Feds&#34;). When the location was investigated, field agents discovered SCP-6580 in its current state. When questioning the locals, people in the area describe the building as having been a four story office building working under the Hasselhoff Corporation [[footnote]] No records of this company exist. [[/footnote]] as an administrative and clerical building. When limited investigation from field agents wielded the existence of a possible paradrug operation, MTF Liaison-5 (&#34;The Hawkshaws&#34;)[[footnote]] A Task Force specializing in paracriminal activity. [[/footnote]]  was called in to investigate further. Below is the initial exploration log between the exploration team and Foundation Command.

&gt;&gt; ----------
&gt;&gt; **Assigned Mobile Task Force:** Liaison-5 (&#34;The Hawkshaws&#34;)
&gt;&gt; **Team Leader:** Captain Matthew S. Ulysses 
&gt;&gt; **Designated SIC:** Agent Gary H. Benet  
&gt;&gt; **Mission Description:** Investigate a building suspected of holding a paradrug operation in Everett, Washington, apprehend any possible suspects in the area for interrogation, and bag any and all evidence of the operation for research purposes. 
&gt;&gt; ---------
&gt;&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Audio and recording begins. The team is currently stationed outside of the APC they arrived in, facing the front entrance to SCP-6580.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** Alright everyone. Cameras on and audio check for our boys back home. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Benet:** Surveillance cam and body cam on. Check. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** Body cam on, check. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Dixon:** Body cam on. Check check. 
&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt; **Agent Hornwright:** Body cam operational. Check. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** You got all that, command?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Command:** Affirmative. You may enter as soon as your team is ready.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** Copy that, command. Anything we don&#39;t already know that we should be aware of before we proceed?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Dixon:** Like if this building is gonna vanish with us inside?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Command:** As far as observations have gone, we don&#39;t know. The location doesn&#39;t currently exhibit any kind of unnatural Hume levels nor any significant thaumaturgical energy. We will alert you if we get something. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** That&#39;s disheartening. We&#39;re going in blind?
&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt; **Agent Benet:** It&#39;s nothing we&#39;re not already accustomed to. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Hornwright:** It&#39;s nothing to not be wary of either. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** If that&#39;s everyone&#39;s complaints out of the way...
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Audio is silent for several seconds as Capt. Ulysses pans over the team.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:**...then we can get this over with. Let&#39;s get to work. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //Audio goes quiet besides the steps of the team and occasional breathing. Capt. Ulysses is seen trying to open the entrance, which is a double metal door.//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** Locked, heavy duty. Dixon?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Dixon:** Got it, sir.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Agent Dixon approaches the entrance as the rest of the team backs away. He uses his supplied breaching shotgun to shoot off the hinges to both sides. The door falls backwards, revealing a small hallway with a single wooden door at the end, and a glassed off room to the right of the now breached door. The wooden door is slightly opened.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Dixon:** That never gets old. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** Search this area, don&#39;t proceed further before we have. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;The team moves inside as they search the hallway, searching inside the glassed off room as well. Agent Hornwright finds the remains of a notebook laying inside the glassed off room, with the words &#34;Names We Can Trust&#34; scribbled on in black marker. The first five pages have names listed on them, three are torn out, and the rest are blank.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Hornwright:** We got names. Suspects, more than likely.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** You got any idea why they may have a notebook with &#34;Names We Can Trust&#34; plastered over it?  
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Hornwright:** A vague one. This was a paradrug operation, right? They probably got a lot of foot traffic around here, so whoever they are, they wrote down some people they know wouldn&#39;t snitch.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** Bag it as evidence. Maybe we can cross some names off our list. If that&#39;s all, we can proceed.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;The team moves past the wooden door, and enters a large, open space. Fallen metal shelves dot the ground, and an abundance of medical and chemistry equipment has been thrown across the floor haphazardly. A few stacked boxes are the only things evidently not damaged.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Dixon:** Poor work environment, yeah? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** Command, you see this mess?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Command:** Affirmative. We suspect the perpetrators flew into a panic when the building first disappeared, or attempted to destroy the evidence before fleeing. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Benet:** That&#39;s plausible, but they did a terrible job at destroying it. We could probably bag half of this. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** We&#39;ll do that after we get this place locked down. This place isn&#39;t too big, safe enough to spread out. Whatever you find, get a good look at it and let command log it down. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Dixon:** Let&#39;s do it fast too, yeah? I wanna get outta here if this place decides to vanish again. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** You afraid of going to Neverland?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Agent Dixon groans as the team disperses and continues to search the area. While searching one of the undamaged boxes, Agent Dixon&#39;s feed shows it is filled to the brim with purple capsule pills, later identified as SCP-6580-A.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Dixon:** Captain, I think I found the drugs they were making here.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;  //&lt;Capt. Ulysses makes his way towards Agent Dixon, looking into the box as well. He then opens an adjacent box, and finds that it is also filled with SCP-6580-A.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** It&#39;s giving me a headache just by looking at it. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Dixon:** You think that has something to do with what these things do?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** We won&#39;t know for certain until we get a sample of it back to base. Bag a few of them and keep them on you until we leave.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Agent Dixon nods takes a handful of SCP-6580-A, securing them in one of his storage pouches.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** Alright, let&#39;s-
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Before Capt. Ulysses can continue, his camera feed picks up movement from a nearby door.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** Fuck, we got movement.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** We&#39;re not alone?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Dixon:** That makes things much more interesting.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** Maybe. Command, can you confirm movement?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Upon reviewing the footage, viewers confirm movement to be something vaguely human appearing to quietly but quickly close a storage closet door.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Command:** Affirmative, please advise caution on your approach. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** Benet, Evelyn, you&#39;re with me on left. Dixon, go with Hornwright and approach from the right.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Agents regroup to respective positions. Agents Hornwright and Dixon approach the door from a descending stairway to the right, while Capt. Ulysses and Agents Evelyn and Benet approach from the door from the left, leaning against the wall as they move.&gt;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** //&lt;whispering&gt;// On three. One...
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;As Capt. Ulysses is reaching for the knob to the door, a sudden surge in psionic energy surrounds the building. Communications are momentarily cut.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** Two...
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Command:** //&lt;Distorted.&gt;// 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Benet:** //&lt;whispering&gt;// Command, repeat? Command. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;The surge of energy increases, completely surrounding the building and some of the surrounding area.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** Three.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Audio cuts out completely as SCP-6580 vanishes.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; [END LOG]
&gt;&gt; [[/&lt;]]
&gt; [[&lt;]]
&gt; During the exploration, a sudden surge of psionic energy from an unknown source engulfed the surrounding area of SCP-6580 and caused the first recorded shift into Dimension-130. Any and all attempts at communication yielded no results. Due to the lack of a physical location, a recovery team could not be sent in to retrieve the team, and as such no other recovery efforts were attempted. The personnel at Observation Post Beta were ordered not to interfere with the area, and were advised to watch for a reappearance of SCP-6580 until further notice.

------

**Addendum-6580-1: 12/12/10:** On December 12th, 2010, SCP-6580 reappeared with noticeable damage to its exterior and interior. Complying with orders received following personnel reporting the reappearance, Observation Post Beta dispatched field agents to conduct a quick search of the area. The interior was reported to be in worse condition than before, and multiple unknown persons were reported dead across the inside of the building, including all of the agents. Attached below are the recovered audio logs of the team following the shift of SCP-6580.

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** Don&#39;t move! Hands up! 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **???:** //&lt;Whispering&gt;// Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don&#39;t shoot! Don&#39;t- Shit, don&#39;t be so fucking loud, will you? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Live feed of all agents show the storage room is occupied by seven unknown persons, the one in front being the one speaking.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Benet:** Get on your knees with hands behind your head, now! 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **???:** //&lt;Whispering&gt;// Fine, fine, yeah! Just, be bloody quiet.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;With a nod from the man speaking, all persons proceed to drop down to their knees and put their hands behind their head. Agents Dixon and Hornwright apprehend each person by cuffing their hands behind their backs, while Agent Evelyn stands guard at the doorway. Once each person is secured, Capt. Ulysses proceeds to approach the one previously speaking.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** State your name.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **???:** Listen, we don&#39;t-
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** Your. Name. Please.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** Oh my God, it&#39;s McGregor, but listen, where-
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** Is there anyone else here should be aware of?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** No! Listen, goddammit, where&#39;d you come from!?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** That&#39;s classified.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** Classi- we&#39;re in another bloody dimension! How classified can you possibly be right now!?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Agents Hornwright and Dixon look at each other. Agent Benet looks inside.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Benet:** Captain, what&#39;d he say?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** We&#39;re what?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;One of the previously quiet persons now speaks up.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **???:** Just fucking listen! Look outside! 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** //&lt;Whispering&gt;// Be fucking quiet, Ivan! They&#39;ll hear us just like they heard Frank! 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Ivan:** //&lt;Whispering&gt;// Like you were just any quiet!
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** Both of you be quiet. What&#39;s outside and who&#39;s they?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **???:** Do what Ivan said and look outside, dipshit. Get a good look.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;With a frustrated sigh, Capt. Ulysses looks to Agent Dixon.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** Dixon, go look outside. Call us over comms if something is out of place.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Dixon:** Yes, sir.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Agent Dixon departs.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** You better make sure he doesn&#39;t get found while looking.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** And why&#39;s that?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** Because whatever killed my friends is still out there. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Benet:** Do what the captain said and shut up.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** Bite me, fed.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Benet:** What did you just call me?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** Benet, calm down.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Dixon:** //&lt;Over comms&gt;// Captain?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** Report, Dixon.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Dixon:** //&lt;Over comms&gt;// We&#39;re not in Washington anymore.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** Fuck. Where are you?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Dixon:** //&lt;Over comms&gt;// Far end of the building in front of a window, straight ahead.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** Told you.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Capt. Ulysses leaves the room and sprints to the other end of the building, where Agent Dixon is standing. Although distorted, both agents feeds display a wide expanse of a dark purple clouds that are constantly moving and swirling. A slight pink mist is also apparent, though is not moving with the clouds. Rapid movement among the clouds was later identified as multiple hundred instances of SCP-6580-B. Both agents stare for several seconds before the feed picks up a noise akin to screaming.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** //&lt;Picked up from Agent Hornwrights audio&gt;// Oh, shit. They found us again.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt, Ulysses:** //&lt;Over comms&gt;// Evelyn, Hornwright, secure that room! Lock it and make sure those suspects don&#39;t move! Benet, regroup with me and Dixon at the center of the floor! 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Agents Evelyn and Hornwright lock the door to the room with the suspects. Capt. Ulysses with Agents Benet and Dixon regroup at the center of the building.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Benet:** What was that?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** Not entirely sure. Once we know where we are, we&#39;ll-
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Capt. Ulysses is interrupted by the shattering of a nearby window. The shattering is seen to have been caused by a stream of purple clouds and pink mist, which proceeds to materialize into an animalistic form in front of the window. A clear image of it is not available, however it appears very large and bulky. The entity screams as it faces the agents. This was confirmed as an SCP-6580-B instance.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Dixon:** Please tell me I&#39;m seeing things.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Benet:** No, but it hurts to look at- shit, headache! 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;The entity moves forward slowly, knocking shelves and tables out of the way. It stops as it screams again, and appears to stare down Agent Benet.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Benet:** Fuck! Fuck! It hurts! Christ!
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;As Agent Benet holds his head and drops to his knees, Capt. Ulysses fires upon the instance, followed by Agent Dixon. Although there is no visible effect, it distracts the entity, causing Agent Benet to regain his composure. The instance then charges Agent Dixon.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Dixon:** Holy shit! 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Agent Dixon dives out of the way just in time to dodge the instance as it attempts to swing a massive arm down onto him. Capt. Ulysses stops firing as the instance hits a wall. He runs to Agent Benet, helping him to his feet.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** What happened, Benet?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Benet:** Get off me! 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Agent Benet&#39;s sudden hostility causes Capt. Ulysses to back away. Agent Benet then drops to his knees again, again holding his head.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Benet:** It knows, it- fuck! It&#39;s digging into my head! Get it out! Get it out! Fucking GET IT OUT!
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Capt. Ulysses goes for Agent Benet again, but is interrupted by Agent Evelyn.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** //&lt;Over comms&gt;// Captain!
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Capt. Ulysses quickly turns to find another SCP-6580-B instance clawing at the door containing the suspects and Agents Evelyn and Hornwright. This entity is visibly smaller and thinner, clawing at the door ferociously. It is unknown how the instance made it inside without making any previous noise.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** Dixon! Help Eve and Hornwright! I got Benet! 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Dixon:** On it! 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Agent Dixon engages the smaller entity. Capt. Ulysses then turns to find the entity staring at Agent Benet, once again causing Agent Benet immense pain. He opens fire, but does not distract the entity again.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Benet:** Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Capt. Ulysses runs to Agent Benet again, grabbing him and shaking.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** Benet! Benet! Gary, snap out of it! It&#39;s in your head
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Agent Benet screams loudly as the instance approaches, purple tendrils emerging from its body and extend to close in on Agent Benet. Capt. Ulysses momentarily drops Agent Benet and attempts to shoot at the tendrils, but there is no visible effect. One violently lashes at Capt. Ulysses, the force of which violently knocks him into a wall. He attempts to stand, but fails as another tendril lashes at him again, knocking him out.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Benet:** Fuck!
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;At the same time, Agent Benet is seen being lifted to face the larger instance. The instance screams, and Agent Benet screams in sync with it. Over Agent Benet&#39;s audio, the feed quiets and Agent Benet is heard whispering multiple obscenities, and then the following.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Benet:** Mama always said I had a temper.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;The instance screams louder, which causes mass distortion in all agents&#39; live feeds. Agent Benet proceeds to scream again, before a loud explosion is heard and the feed cuts entirely.&gt;//

&gt;&gt; //&lt;The live feed of each team member shows the inside of the storage room where the suspects were originally found, except for Capt. Ulysses who is unconscious and whose feed is showing the ceiling. Agent Benets feed is unavailable.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** So, in total, how long have you all actually been here?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** Hard to say, really. The clocks don&#39;t work, communications aren&#39;t available, and my phone was already dead before this all happened.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Dixon:** You didn&#39;t think to-? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** I had a rough morning, okay? The IHOP I always go to was closed, so I took the dreadful advice of my mate Thomas and went to Dennys instead. God, they suck. Didn&#39;t let me think as straight as I could.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Ivan:** You have absolutely no idea what you&#39;re talking about. Dennys is ten times better than any IHOP in the country.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** If my hands weren&#39;t tied, I&#39;d kick the shit out of you.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Ivan:** If your //hands// weren&#39;t tied you&#39;d //kick// me? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;McGregor starts to respond, but is interrupted.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** Hey, McGregor, question? Remember?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** What? Oh, yeah, maybe a few hours plus the one y&#39;all have been here.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Hornwright:** That doesn&#39;t match up with the locals. Majority of them said they stopped seeing activity around here days prior to the appearance of this building. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** Are you lying to me, McGregor?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** What need would I have for lying? I&#39;ve practically told you everything I know about this place.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** I asked you one question.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** I have had a headache for over an hour, okay? Sorry if I&#39;m not completely paying attention because my bloody head wants to explode like your-
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Dixon:** Finish that sentence and I shoot you. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;McGregor scoffs.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** Next, how much do you know about the drug you were making here?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** The pills? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Dixon:** Yeah, these. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Agent Dixon shows McGregor the bag of SCP-6580-A instances he acquired at the start of the mission. McGregor tries to grab for it, but is stopped by his restraints.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** What about them?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Hornwright:** Let&#39;s start with what it does, since it seems to be giving everyone in here a headache.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Dixon:** Speaking of that, yeah, I need to sit down. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Agent Dixon hands the SCP-6580-A instances to Agent Hornwright before he goes to sit down in the leftmost corner of the room, holding his head. McGregor is seen smirking, before speaking.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** When we were offered to make this stuff for a good load, they didn&#39;t tell us much of anything about it. Were we curious? Yeah. Preston asked one of them, but I dunno what they told him.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** Is Preston anyone in here?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** We haven&#39;t seen him since the first time this place came here. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;One of the suspects starts to openly cry, which appears to cause a mild discomfort in all but one of the room occupants. The one unaffected is sitting in the corner opposite of Agent Dixon, facing the wall and rocking back and fourth.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** And, uh, either way, well...again, we didn&#39;t really care. Not that it really matters. We were getting paid big bucks from my...
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;McGregor looks around and clears his throat.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:**...employer. We got paid, that was all that mattered. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** Your employer?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** I can&#39;t talk about that. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** Why not?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** You wouldn&#39;t understand.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** Maybe I won&#39;t, but I guess that doesn&#39;t matter right now, we&#39;ll figure that out later. In the meantime, what //can// you tell me?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** The name of it. I think they called it something, like...psi...psi, something?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** Psi? Like, psychopath? Psychic?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** They actually said psionic a lot when talking about it. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** Psionic, then. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Hornwright:** I&#39;ve heard about psionics before. Telepathy, psychic powers, stuff to do with the mind.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** Oh yeah, yeah, Psiphetamine! They called the stuff Psiphetamine. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** Psiphetamine? Like, methamphetamine? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** Maybe? Beats me. The stuff isn&#39;t even anything like that.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Hornwright:** So do you know what it does? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;McGregor shrugs and doesn&#39;t speak further.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **???:** I, uh, I do.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Agents Hornwright and Evelyn turn to the voice, which is coming from the corner of the room opposite of Agent Dixon. They are presumably the youngest in the room, as their appearance suggests they are around 18-20 years of age.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** You have a name?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Carter:** Carter.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Hornwright:** And you know how these pills work?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Carter:** Yes.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** Would you mind telling us?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Carter:** No, no I...I wouldn&#39;t, um. I overheard one guy, one of the ones that came to deliver the supplies for us to make it, talking about it with the guy that was in charge of us before, this all happened. They mentioned it could enhance the abilities of &#34;psionically capable people&#34;. They&#39;d been selling it in, I don&#39;t know, some place they called &#34;[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/three-portlands-hub | Three Portlands]]]&#34;. I&#39;m probably wrong, but that&#39;s what they said.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Upon hearing this, Agents Evelyn and Hornwright share a brief look.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Hornwright:** How knowledgeable are you in...what&#39;s going on around here?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Carter:** What do you mean?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** Up until when you heard it, have you ever heard of Three Portlands before? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Carter:** I&#39;ve heard of Portland, Oregon, but not Three Portlands.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Agent Hornwright sighs heavily, and makes gestures to get the other suspects attention.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Hornwright:** Show of hands. Who in here has ever heard of or been to Three Portlands?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Four out of the seven suspects, including McGregor and Ivan, raise their hands.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Hornwright:** How many of you actually know about the anomalous and paranormal?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Same result of people raise their hands.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** I&#39;m actually from Eurtec. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Ivan:** I used to live in SoHo, if that matters. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Agent Evelyn holds up a hand to signal them to be quiet, then starts to whisper to Agent Hornwright.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** We don&#39;t have any amnestics, do we?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Hornwright:** We don&#39;t, but we&#39;ll handle that later. Carter, is there anything else you can tell us?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Carter:** They mentioned some kind of drawbacks before I got shooed off. How it can be addictive to people with those kinds of powers, and how people who don&#39;t have them could be &#34;overwhelmed&#34;. I...think that&#39;s what happened to Kyle.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Hornwright:** Kyle?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** //&lt;interrupting&gt;// A lazy worker is what he was. I can blame two botched cases of the stuff on him. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** What happened to him? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Carter:** His head, uh, exploded. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Hornwright:** His head exploded? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Carter:** Yeah, uh...like, like your-
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** Okay, yeah, we get it. How? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** Zack thought it would be funny if they hid one of the pills in his soda. He&#39;s dead, before you ask.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Carter:** After that, I think that&#39;s when everything happened. He exploded, and a big wave of energy or something threw me back and knocked me out.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Hornwright:** Do you remember anything from when you woke up? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Before Carter can answer, Agent Dixon interrupts by making an audible groaning sound, and slumps against the wall. Agent Evelyn gestures for Agent Hornwright to check on Agent Dixon. As Agent Hornwright is walking, Carter answers the previous question.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Carter:** I got dragged in here with only the seven of us. I remember there had been twenty or so of us, but...I don&#39;t know what happened.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** I&#39;ll tell you what fucking happened, they were killed or taken by those damn things outside. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** Killed by one of those entities we saw?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;At this point, Capt. Ulysses starts to writhe and groan. Agent Evelyn moves to check him. At the same time, Agent Dixon appears to become visibly stressed as Agent Hornwright attempts to calm him.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** Captain? Captain, you there?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Capt. Ulysses is heard muttering, though exact words are unavailable. Seen on Agent Evelyn&#39;s feed, Capt. Ulysses starts to cry profusely. Shortly thereafter, a scream similar to the ones heard in the previous log is heard. Capt. Ulysses is barely heard murmuring in the midst of the screaming.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **McGregor:** Oh, fuck.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** //&lt;While still crying and unconscious&gt;// Papa? Oh, God, papa, i&#39;m so sorry. I&#39;m so fucking sorry, papa. I didn&#39;t- I promise I- 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;As the screaming ends, Agent Dixon is heard yelling and then tackling Agent Hornwright. All audio and live feeds becomes distorted. Once restored, Agent Dixon is seen holding the bag of SCP-6580-A instances in his hands, and Agent Hornwright alongside suspects McGregor, Carter, and Ivan are seen laying nearby, visibly beaten. Agent Evelyn is standing between Agent Dixon, holding her rifle towards the agent as Capt. Ulysses wakes up yelling.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** Dixon! Stop!
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** //&lt;Once he has stopped yelling&gt;// Wh- What the Hell? Dixon? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Dixon:** They&#39;ve been calling for me. Scratching at my head, banging against my skull. They want their power back, and I&#39;m going to give it to them, to make them stop. They said it was my fault! It was my fault she left me! 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** Dixon, this place is fucking with your head, calm-
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Dixon:** She left me for a fucking accountant! While I was saving the goddamn world! 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** Agent Dixon, stand down. Buddy, come on, we&#39;ve talked about this, right? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Agent Dixon momentarily calms down, seeming to come his senses.&gt;// 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Capt. Ulysses:** Come on, Garret. Put the pills down, before you do something bad again.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Dixon:** Again?! 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Before Agent Dixon can act further, another scream is heard over the audio. Agent Dixon reacts violently while Capt. Ulysses keels over, clutching his head. Agent Dixon aims his rifle at Capt. Ulysses and shoots him twice in the chest, yelling indistinguishably. Agent Evelyn aims her rifle, but doesn&#39;t fire. From Agent Dixons feed, Agent Evelyn is seen crying.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** Please, Dixon. Please put it down, please.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Dixon:** None of you ever saw me as anything but a sad, angry man who did the job without question, who did what everyone else fucking does and hid it behind a fake persona! None of you ever fucking cared! 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;He aims at Agent Hornwright, who is now seen attempting to crawl away from Agent Dixon, alongside suspects McGregor and Ivan.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Dixon:** Especially fucking Hornwright!
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Agent Evelyn becomes visibly more distraught as she fires three shots into Agent Dixon. He stumbles, bleeding, but keeps his stance.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Dixon:** You&#39;ve wanted to do that since we got put on this team, haven&#39;t you?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Agent Evelyn continues crying loudly as she pulls Agent Hornwright out of the room, followed by suspects McGregor and Ivan. Whilst heavily bleeding, Agent Dixon opens the bag of SCP-6580-A and ingest all instances found inside. For a brief moment, all audio goes silent as Agent Dixon has no visible reaction. His expression then changes to horror as he looks around the room, then at Agent Evelyn.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Dixon:** I-I&#39;m so sorry, Eve. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;A bright purple explosion occurs, causing a shockwave that disables all live feeds and audio.&gt;//

No further logs were recovered. All agents, excluding Agent Dixon, were found deceased inside SCP-6580. Further attempts at exploration of SCP-6580 or the dimension associated with it has been prohibited by Overwatch Command. Current containment procedures were put in place shortly after the reappearance of SCP-6580. 
------
**Addendum-6580-2: 12/15/10:** After a third submission from Dr. Leopold requesting the recovery of a stash of SCP-6580-A instances from inside SCP-6580 for testing purposes, the request was approved by a representative from Overwatch Command, Secretary Lilac, with the exception that testing would be overseen by Site-99 Director Thomas Patton and that subjects would strictly be D-Class personnel. A recovery team extracted a singular box full of SCP-6580-A instances, numbering an estimated 200 instances. The following file contains all documented 6580-A tests.

&gt;&gt; ----------
&gt;&gt; **Test 1**
&gt;&gt; **Subject:** D-777091
&gt;&gt; **Procedure:** D-777091 displayed minor psionic potential, but with no discernible abilities. One 6580-A instance was provided, and D-777091 was instructed to ingest it. 
&gt;&gt; **Result:** D-777091 displayed minor discomfort before dropping to the floor and screaming for three minutes and twenty-six seconds straight whilst thrashing around, seemingly in a fit of rage. She then attempted to ram the chamber door headfirst, resulting in her [DATA EXPUNGED] in a shockwave of psionic energy, similar to Test 4, and causing the appearance of a 6580-B instance. This instance was incredibly similar to the one encountered by the exploration team in Log-2B. It attempted several times to violently escape the chamber by bashing against the walls and door before it eventually dissipated half an hour later.
&gt;&gt; -------
&gt;&gt; **Test 2**
&gt;&gt; **Subject:** D-209381
&gt;&gt; **Procedure:** D-209381 was selected both due to their minor psionic potential and severe melancholic depression. One 6580-A instance was provided and D-209381 was instructed to ingest it. 
&gt;&gt; **Result:** Upon ingestion, no immediate effects took place. D-209381 both smiled and cried before undergoing the same process as the last two tests, resulting in a 6580-B instance. It was the third largest instance to date, and resembled a large, gelatinous object laying in the corner of the chamber. A low but constant weeping was heard among all viewing personnel, though the tone and source of the sound varied between reports. The instance dissipated three hours later. 
&gt;&gt; ------
&gt; **Update 12/17/10:** Dr. Leopold made a request to Director Patton for usage of select PoIs with more advanced psionic potential in order to gain better results with tests, stating that D-Class were insufficient for testing. Director Patton forwarded the request to Overwatch Command, where the request was denied due to possible security risks. Dr. Leopold made a second request later that day for access to researcher personnel that displayed psionic capabilities. This request was accepted, but was limited to four personnel in total. 
&gt;&gt; ----------
&gt;&gt; **Test 3**
&gt;&gt; **Subject:** Jr. Researcher Clarence 
&gt;&gt; **Procedure:** Jr. Researcher Clarence had displayed previous psychokinetic abilities (similar to the subject in Test 2), having been recorded as moving small objects for personal convenience. A single 6580-A instance was provided, and Jr. Researcher Clarence was instructed ingest the instance and then attempt to move any of a variety of objects supplied in the room. 
&gt;&gt; **Result:** Jr. Researcher Clarence complained of a mild headache upon ingesting the instance. Jr. Researcher Clarence chose the following supplied objects to move; one shaded lamp, two foldable metal chairs, and one wooden nightstand. He proceeded to lift up each object individually into the air before lifting them all at once and spinning them in a circle. Jr. Researcher Clarence performed a variety of feats he was not previously capable of for a total of twenty eight minutes before all objects abruptly fell. Jr. Researcher Clarence&#39;s psychokinetic abilities returned to normal at the same time, and was returned to duty.
&gt;&gt; -------
&gt;&gt; **Test 4** 
&gt;&gt; **Subject:** Sr. Researcher Sharpe &amp; Assistant Researcher Ariel
&gt;&gt; **Procedure:** Sr. Researcher Sharpe had been originally employed as a Mobile Task Force agent and assigned to [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2664 | Mobile Task Force Lambda-9 (&#34;Mind over Matter&#34;)]]] due to their metapsionic ability. Assistant Researcher Ariel is a psion-in-training under Sr. Researcher Sharpes supervision and training, allowed in the experiment to fully document Sharpe&#39;s metapsionic ability. Due to Sr. Researcher Sharpe&#39;s long time experience in parapsychology and life as a psychic, two 6580-A instances were provided and Sr. Researcher Sharpe was instructed to ingest both one at a time. To ensure maximum safety, additional guards were provided at the entrance to the testing chamber. 
&gt;&gt; **Result:** Sr. Researcher Sharpe ingested one of the instances and displayed no visible discomfort. Minor discomfort was seen upon ingesting the second instance, and Sharpe exclaimed annoyance at the apparently &#34;crude and rudimentary&#34; usage of the psionic power in the instances. After a minute of concentration, Sr. Researcher Sharpe exerted a large output of psionic energy towards Assistant Researcher Ariel. [DATA EXPUNGED]. Sr. Researcher Sharpe and Assistant Researcher Ariel were sent to the on-site psych ward. 
&gt;&gt; -------
&gt;&gt; **Test 5** 
&gt;&gt; **Subject:** Dr. Bonnet
&gt;&gt; **Procedure:** Dr. Bonnet has displayed an advanced precognitive ability tied to psionics due to being a natural and powerful psychic, and had undergone previous training to hone her skills. One 6580-A instance was supplied, and Dr. Bonnet was instructed to ingest the instance and attempt to gain foreknowledge of any item or person in the immediate area. 
&gt;&gt; **Result:** Dr. Bonnet complained of a mild headache upon ingesting the instance, then proceeded to touch the wall of the testing chamber. [REDACTED] [[footnote]] Due to the sensitive nature of the information in Dr. Bonnet&#39;s precognitive vision, the details have been redacted. [[/footnote]]. Dr. Bonnet immediately transferred herself off-site. 
&gt;&gt; -------
&gt; **Update 12/20/10:** Dr. Leopold made a second request for both more psionic and non-psionic subjects, with a list of details attached to the email that described an experiment with the end result being the safe awakening of psionic potential in non-psionic individuals. It was at this point that both Director Patton and Secretary Lilac formally warned Dr. Leopold on his frequent requests for testing despite the apparent security risks that could and have ensued. The request was denied, and it was planned for Dr. Leopold to be transferred off-site and for the remainder of the SCP-6580-A instances to be put in cold storage at Site-19. 
&gt; 
&gt; Despite this, an additional test was planned and readied without Director Patton or Secretary Lilac&#39;s knowledge. It was assumed that Dr. Leopold conducted this final test by abusing his status as a Level 4 researcher, gaining access to two additional D-Class subjects and two 6580-A instances. It is unknown at this time if any additional personnel were involved. 
&gt;&gt; ----------
&gt;&gt; **Test 6**
&gt;&gt; **Subject:** D-009831 &amp; D-975361
&gt;&gt; **Procedure:** D-009831 displayed no psionic potential at any point, and was randomly picked from a selection of other D-Class of the same standard. D-975361 displayed medium psionic potential with an metapsionic ability similar to Sr. Researcher Sharpe in Test 9. Two SCP-6580-A instances were supplied, and D-975361 was instructed to ingest the instance and attempt a breakthrough in psionic potential with D-009831, who was instructed to ingest the second instance shortly after D-975361.

&gt; -----------
&gt; **Overview:** On 12/20/10, Site-99 transmitted a report of a sudden surge of powerful psionic energy to Site-38 and Observation Post Beta, and requested assistance in a possible containment breach. While the request was met and forces were directed to Site-99, the site experienced a shift similar to SCP-6580 and completely disappeared. As forces arrived and reported the situation, they were given new orders from Overwatch Command to set a perimeter around the former area of Site-99. Once the perimeter was established, additional forces were deployed to ensure full security of the area and in the scenario that, if or when Site-99 reappeared, it harbored any hostile entities. Until the confirmation on the reappearance of Site-99 and the report of its current state, no personnel outside of the perimeter forces, Site-38, Observation Post Beta, and members of the O5 Council were to know of its disappearance. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Casualty Report:** Estimated ███ missing personnel. Presumed dead.
&gt; 
&gt; **Missing Items Report:** Estimated ██ missing anomalous items. Items have not been considered important enough for emergency retrieval. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Update 1/03/11:** Site-99 confirmed to have reappeared. The site is heavily damaged and enshrouded by a mist of what has been confirmed to be unstable psionic energy. The site was broadcasting its emergency beacon, and a repeat automated message requesting for immediate support due to a mass containment breach. Despite the message, no known anomalies within Site-99 were reported to be seen inside or outside the site. 
&gt; 
&gt; By direct orders from the O5 Council, no personnel were to enter Site-99 under any circumstances. An MTF was not to attempt to investigate the site, but the perimeter was to be kept at all times due to the possible dangers it represented. Any personnel caught having entered Site-99 will be amnesticized of the events and their deployment in the area and transferred off-site immediately. More severe actions may be met with immediate termination.

&gt; Contrary to the information in the above file, not all agents were found deceased or missing. Agent Evelyn was found in a locked room near the front entrance of SCP-6580, crouched in a corner and murmuring to herself. She was unresponsive to attempts at communication, but complied with agents while being escorted outside of SCP-6580. Agent Evelyn was sent to Site-26 for psychological evaluation. After reviewing the logs, Agent Evelyn was put through a PRS[[footnote]] Psychic Resistance Scale [[/footnote]] test, which they scored high on. Agent Evelyn was interviewed shortly afterwards about the events that transpired in the logs.
&gt; --------
&gt;&gt; **Interview-A**
&gt;&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Montgomery
&gt;&gt; **Interviewee:** Agent Evelyn
&gt;&gt; ----------
&gt;&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Dr. Montgomery:** Good evening, agent. How are you feeling?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** Better, I suppose. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Dr. Montgomery:** You suppose? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** I could be back there. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Dr. Montgomery:** I suppose you could, but you&#39;re here now, and that is what matters.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Dr. Montgomery writes something down on his clipboard.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Dr. Montgomery:** Speaking of it, that is what I&#39;m here to talk to you about.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** Really? I just can&#39;t catch a break, can I? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Dr. Montgomery:** You were subject to an event that we don&#39;t quite understand. Once this interview is over, I promise you&#39;ll be put on leave until you&#39;ve fully recovered from the experience. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** That makes sense.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Dr. Montgomery:** Right, then. Are you ready?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** Yeah.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Dr. Montgomery:** Prior to the shift, did you feel any kind of headaches while inside? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** No, not me at least. I think Garret was the first to find them, the pills. They were hard to be around I guess, because he got the headaches first. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Dr. Montgomery:** How would you describe the headaches?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** It wasn&#39;t like having them before. Not like pounding, but more like constant scratching. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Dr. Montgomery:** Do you think it was //something// that was scratching? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** I think so, but it&#39;s hard to describe. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Dr. Montgomery:** That is fine. Next, this is a very personal question, but I am required to ask it. Did any of your team, particularly Agent Dixon, show any signs of emotional trauma that was not reported to their assigned psychiatrist?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Agent Evelyn stays quiet for several seconds before speaking.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** Sometimes, I never really took any notice, but otherwise Dixon was his happy-go-lucky self. Him and Ulysses were closer, they probably talked more, but they&#39;re...fuck, i&#39;m sorry.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Dr. Montgomery:** It&#39;s fine, I understand. Moving on, the suspects your team interacted with said there had been more of them. Were there any previous signs of life besides the seven you encountered? Any bodies, maybe?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** No. It was nothing but them and us.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Dr. Montgomery:** Are you completely sure?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** Did you guys find something we didn&#39;t? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Dr. Montgomery:** No, but I just have to make sure. Every bit of information is vital.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** If you really want to know, here&#39;s what I know; whatever was in there, they wanted those damn pills. Dixon said that too, that they wanted their &#34;power&#34; back. Whoever the manufacturers were, they were siphoning energy from that realm and making it a drug to sell. I don&#39;t...I don&#39;t know how they did it, but it made those things in there...just, angry. It made the entire dimension angry. So, immensely angry. I could feel it whenever I saw one. Just pure anger, directly at us. They didn&#39;t want us there, they didn&#39;t want us to- to mess with anything, to get- to- 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //&lt;Agent Evelyn becomes emotionally distraught and starts crying profusely.&gt;//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Agent Evelyn:** I&#39;m so sorry, guys. I-I&#39;m so, so sorry. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Dr. Montgomery:** Alright, alright. Interview concluded. I&#39;ll have Doctor Reeves come get you.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; [END LOG]
&gt; ------
&gt; Upon the conclusion of the interview, Agent Evelyn was put on leave until she could fully recover from the events in SCP-6580. In light of Agent Evelyn&#39;s likely severe PTSD from the events, amnestication and permanent removal from duty was recommended by Dr. Reeves and is pending review.
