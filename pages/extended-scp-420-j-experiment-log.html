Yeah, so, remember a while back when me and M████, we got hold of that [[[SCP-420-J | excellent ████]]], and we were like, whoa, holy ████, that is excellent, and then we shared  some of the ████ we had? Well, M████&#39;s like, dude, we should do that again, and I&#39;m like, yeah, man, we totally should, and so we did.

**Incident CN-0993-Q:** On 04/08/16, a new episode of &#34;Bobble the Clown&#34; was intercepted.
**Episode Name:** &#34;Bobble Gets Baked&#34;
**Episode Description:** The episode begins with Bobble the Clown sitting on a couch smoking a comically-oversized marijuana cigarette. Instead of the typical clown outfit, Bobble is wearing a Bob Marley t-shirt, a gray hoodie, and pajama bottoms decorated with marijuana leaves. The rest of Bobble&#39;s costume-- hat, wig, makeup, nose, gloves, and shoes-- are as typical. The episode is divided into three segments: &#34;How To Roll the Perfect Doobie&#34;, &#34;How To Make a Bong Out of Found Materials&#34;, and &#34;How To Take Over the Regional Black Market Drug Trade With Ruthless Efficiency&#34;. The last segment is by far the longest, and ends with a six-plus-minute montage of Bobble the Clown gunning down drug rivals using a wide variety of powerful firearms.

&gt; //I **told** you clowns are scary as ████!// --Dr. M████
&gt; 
&gt; //Yeah, man, totally. But that clown knows his ████.// --Dr. C████

__Test F__

&gt; //Man, I tried to give some of this ████ to [[[SCP-1981 | that old dude who keeps gettin&#39; cut up]]], but he just said No.// --Dr. M████

----

__Test G__

&gt; //Hey man, we should give some of this ████ to that guy... oh what&#39;s his name...? Oh yeah, [[[SCP-2337 | Spanky]]]!// --Dr. M████

**Incident DK-2337-48L:** On 04/17/16, at 23:35, an excessive auditory event occurred in Interview Room 19 at Site-17. Sound pressure measurements estimate loudness in excess of 120 dB within ten meters of Interview Room 19, setting off seismic detectors around the site. Witnesses describe the sound as &#34;like a hacking cough, except cacking&#34;.

&gt; //Dude. Cack, man. Just... cack.// --Dr. M████
&gt; 
&gt; //Whoa. That&#39;s some deep ████, man.// --Dr. C████

----

__Test H__

&gt; //Yeah man, so I was looking for a place to light up, without any people around, so I went out on this [[[SCP-087 | staircase]]], and it looked all right, quiet, no one around... but then all this freaky ████ started happenin&#39;, and I got out of there, man, but I must have dropped my joint back there somewhere. I just lost my ████, man.// --Dr. C████
