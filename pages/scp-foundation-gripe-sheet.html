This is an open collab though weaker entries do get pruned from time to time. Based on the maintenance gripe sheet lists you might find online or shared in an email from your uncle. Enjoy some dry humor and snarky responses!
[[include :scp-wiki:component:author-label-source end=--]]

Foundation personnel submit maintenance reports, also known as &#34;gripe forms&#34;, to inform level 2 site mechanics about any problems they experience with containment cells and connected facilities. The maintenance crews process the requests, solve the problems, document their repair solutions and file the reports away by once resolved. Submitted problems are marked with a &#34;P&#34;, while the solutions are marked with an &#34;S&#34;.


Collected Maintenance Reports. Ten per page. Current as of --1/26/2018-- 5/25/2020.
Overseen by Site-██ Head Maintenance Supervisor Jaimison.


[[collapsible show=&#34;▼ Open Guide For Submitting Reports&#34; hide=&#34;△ Hide Guide For Submitting Reports&#34; hideLocation=&#34;both&#34;]]

//Note: Submitted reports are listed ten per page, with newer reports added at the bottom of the last page. Requests come in daily for all manner of odd tasks, often well outside of normal maintenance work. Luckily, inner site maintenance crews can take a joke. 
-Head Maintenance Supervisor Jaimison//

**Standard format for reports:**
&gt; **P:** Problem reported.
&gt; **S:** Solution carried out.

**Example:**
&gt; **P:** The Foundation is a cold and dangerous place to work in.
&gt; **S:** It helps to have a sense of humor.


**ADVICE:** Keep it simple! Focus on one thing that would require maintenance per report. Think on what kind of strange happenings would be borderline everyday problems at the foundation. Like a vending machine that can dispense lava as easily as coffee. Or a living goo leaving a trail of slime. 

If you want feedback first, comment your idea in the discussion, otherwise, additions are deleted/edited at [[*user toadking07 ]]&#39;s discretion.
