Hi there. My name is Mr. Money. Don&#39;t worry, I just need somebody to talk to. Seeing as it&#39;s just you and me on this bus, it might as well be you.

I&#39;d talk to the driver, but there&#39;s a sign right there saying not to. See? //Do not disturb the driver//. I wouldn&#39;t do that, seeing as how the bus might crash and then I&#39;d have to //walk// all that way. You ever walk in rain like this? Let me tell you, it&#39;s freezing! So I&#39;m just gonna sit here and talk to you. You.

Oh come on, don&#39;t move! I&#39;m just being friendly. Here, take this! See, we&#39;re pals now, right? Yes, it&#39;s a diamond. Yes, it&#39;s real. You see, pal, I know how friendship works. You hearing me...? What&#39;s your name, anyway? Well, hello Dave.

It&#39;s nice to meet a smart fellow like yourself. I usually hang around with this group...ugh, you would not believe. They didn&#39;t understand how friendship works, no they did not. Not like you, Dave. 

I gave them dollars and dimes and //fucking// diamonds! And all they did is call me a snob! Me, can you believe that, Dave?! Have another diamond, you&#39;re a good friend and you look like you could use it. 

Seriously though; me, a snob? It&#39;s not easy to get all this cash, believe me! Puking out the bills is fine, they come out easy. Even coins are no big deal. 

But with diamonds, it&#39;s not so easy! You can choke on diamonds! I have a few times, let me tell you. Good thing Ms. Sweetie was there, though. I would have been a goner! She was always very kind, Ms. Sweetie. Even if she just pitied me, just //fucking// pitied me! 

Stop //fucking// moving, Dave! No, don&#39;t go, have another diamond, please! I&#39;m sorry for shouting, I didn&#39;t mean to. Must have gotten that from Redd, always shouting. Gave me a headache, I don&#39;t mind saying. 

What&#39;s that? Well, Dave, that is a very good question and I don&#39;t //fucking// know why I can puke money so shut the //fuck// up! Sorry, diamond, sorry. I&#39;ll tell you what I do know, because friends share secrets. We&#39;re friends, right Dave?

I have to know what kind of money I want to puke. I couldn&#39;t spit out some yen or something for you right now, because I&#39;ve never been to Asia and I don&#39;t know what yen looks like. You ever been to Asia? Suppose not, flights //are// kind of expensive. So, enough about me, where are you headed? 

Me, I&#39;m headed for...well, I don&#39;t really know, but I&#39;m getting there before those little shits, I know that. They said it wasn&#39;t a race, but let me tell you, Dave, it&#39;s always a race. Have a diamond.
