Margie sits back on the sofa in the family room and rubs her feet. The digitized tones of Beethoven&#39;s Fifth tell her that she&#39;s got a phone call. She wedges her phone between her chin and shoulder and squeezes the remote to turn the volume down with her other hand.

&#34;Oh hello, sweetie. No, it&#39;s not a bad time. The little ones are down for their nap and I&#39;m just watching my stories.&#34;

On Margie&#39;s phone, a voice is questioning.

&#34;They&#39;re not too bad. Not like those little monsters I had last year.&#34;

On the television, two men are having a discussion in a lavishly appointed office. The older man wears a tailored suit and holds a glass a of whiskey. The younger is in a flannel shirt and jeans. The studio lights on his cheekbones make his face look like a waxen mask.

&#34;//Eternal Days// is on right now. It&#39;s not my favorite, but it&#39;s okay. I&#39;m not sure about this new guy they&#39;ve got playing Andrew&#39;s son. He&#39;s pretty enough, in a generic kind of a way, but his acting ... he might as well be a piece of furniture.&#34;

Margie shifts her weight to her other buttock and swaps the phone to her other ear. On the television, Andrew turns his back to his son and starts in on a monologue. His son is smiling. He shouldn&#39;t be smiling.

&#34;Anyway, it&#39;s just a way to pass the time. What&#39;s going on with you? Did your brother have the surgery?&#34;

On the television, Andrew&#39;s son is weighing a marble paperweight in his hand. Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

&#34;Oh that&#39;s so good to hear, I know you were worried. It&#39;s never ... oh good Lord! He just ... he smashed his head right in!&#34;

Margie is sitting on the edge of the sofa, her body leaning forward. On the television, Andrew&#39;s head is a red waterfall. His son pulls him onto the top of the desk and turns him over, still smiling.

&#34;My God, Laurie! I didn&#39;t know you could **do** that on daytime.&#34;

Margie is barely listening. On the television, Andrew&#39;s son has a knife. It looks as old as the world, and is not sharp. It is sharp enough to pierce the tailored suit. It is sharp enough to pierce Andrew. 

&#34;Laurie! I don&#39;t believe this! He killed him! On daytime! He killed him with a knife!&#34;

Andrew&#39;s son is looking at the camera. Margie is pressed against the back of the sofa. Andrew&#39;s son is looking at Margie.

On the television, someone is selling detergent.

&#34;I&#39;m sorry, hon. It was just the damndest thing!&#34;

On Margie&#39;s phone, a voice is chattering.

&#34;It must be sweeps week.&#34;</textarea></pre>
