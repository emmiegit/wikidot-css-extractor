##red|Individuals who view SCP-7125 while actively expressing religious devotion have reported viewing an unidentified entity instead of their reflection.

Discovery: SCP-7125 was identified at Jìngzi wū, an isolated monastery in North China, after local agents investigated reports of ##red|miracles consistent with a class 4 reality bender (i.e. the anomalous manipulation of matter, the implementation of mass hallucinations, and the resurrection of no fewer than four deceased individuals). This monastery was identified as the Order of Reflection, a small cult that had recently acquired significant influence across the surrounding village (See Document-7125 for additional details).## Area-27’s Department of Tactical Theology was subsequently contacted, and Operation Bakunin was initiated to retrieve SCP-7125.

##red|**Document-7125:** The following document is a translated excerpt from what appears to be the primary holy text for the Order of Reflection cult, originally written in the year 1905. A total of nineteen handwritten copies of this text were found to have been distributed across the surrounding village and are believed to account for the recent increase in the cult’s local influence. All known copies of this text were confiscated during the aftermath of Operation Bakinun.##

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
##red|The greatest tragedy of the human condition is our submission to the gods across all our religions. The founders of our order understood this truth more than any other men of their time. They witnessed firsthand the loss of our destiny. They knew the foreign missionaries who demanded obedience on the pain of eternal torment, and counted the lives spent for bloody conflicts in the names of different gods.##

##red|Yet where other men denied the gods altogether, our founders chose a simple question instead: why should people fight over the gods, when it is the gods who should be fighting over people? After all, is it not our belief that creates the gods? Is it not our worship that sustains them? We are, to the gods, what they claim to be for all mankind. They are made in the image of our devotions, and this makes us their masters by right.##

##red|So it was that our founders sought to return humanity to our proper place in the order of all things. They built, through sacrifice, a mirror of blood and bone, that we might finally know the gods as the reflection of our faith. We look into this mirror and see our founders&#39; vision made manifest. We look into this mirror and understand the weight of what they have given us. In their name now, we do solemnly declare a new covenant, to judge the gods and bring them to heel in the service of all mankind.##
[[/div]]

##red|**Incident 12/24/19:** SCP-7125 was considered to be successfully contained until 12/24/19, when the area surrounding Jìngzi wū began to exhibit anomalous incidents consistent with the initial discovery of SCP-7125. An emergency investigation was immediately authorized, and local agents subsequently found that a small population (n = 3) of SCP-7125&#39;s religious followers had escaped amnestitization during Operation Bakinun, as they had been promoting the worship of SCP-7125 throughout nearby villages during this time. These individuals, as well as 27 newly converted followers, were subsequently amnestized. However, the Order of Reflection is still believed to be active in surrounding areas, and additional investigations have been authorized to prevent any unauthorized worship from inadvertently reactivating the reality bending capabilities of SCP-7125.##

RE: Incident 12/24/19
To: O5 Council
From: Site-45-C

Overseers, 

Our current containment protocols for SCP-7125 are not sustainable. If containment requires eliminating any religious following of SCP-7125, we have no choice but to eliminate the very idea of SCP-7125. However, this is where things go wrong. We cannot kill an idea with brute force. The more we insist that SCP-7125 does not exist, the more people will believe in its existence. We’ve seen this all through history, and the present is not different from the past. Only an idea can fight an idea.

Yet I believe this is where we may also find the solution to our predicament. We know that SCP-7125 only acts according to the intentions of its worshippers. This means that if we can direct a sufficient majority share of this worship, we may, by extension, seize control of SCP-7125 itself. To this end, I propose Procedure 45-C-7125, to create a god of the SCP Foundation. 

I acknowledge that this plan has risks. However, these risks are nothing compared to the certainty that comes with inaction. Please reply with your instructions as soon as possible. 

Site-45-C

[[/div]]

**Procedure 45-C-7125:** A team of personnel shall be assigned to provide SCP-7125 with constant worship, with the intention of directing SCP-7125 to contain itself. The size of this team shall be determined by the estimated quantification of unauthorized worship that SCP-7125 receives, calculated as a product of the number of religious followers, and their degree of devotion. All selected personnel must express nothing less than absolute loyalty to the Foundation and are required to undergo psychological evaluations once per month under the guise of routine counseling. Any individuals who are removed from this role must be amnestitized immediately. 

To avoid undue influence by SCP-7125&#39;s cognitohazardous effects, all worship shall be conducted away from Site-45-C, at a set of Foundation owned temples known as the Standard Creed Parish. Personnel assigned to provide worship to SCP-7125 shall be instructed to continuously repeat the following statement:

RE: Procedure 45-C-7125 Denial
To: O5 Council
From: Site-45-C

Overseers, 

My team and I received your denial of Procedure 45-C-7125, and I must say, we are deeply disappointed by this decision. Operation Bakinun, no doubt, has dramatically reduced the worship—and therefore the power—that SCP-7125 currently receives. However, this is not a danger that will simply disappear on its own. This anomaly is a time bomb, and if the Order of Reflection eventually manages to muster sufficient worship, it could reshape our world, and we would never even know. 

I believe that you are already aware of this danger. There is a greater power here than anyone should have the right to possess, but that just means we are only people who can be trusted to possess it. If hypocrisy is the price of safety, then so be it. There is no other way to guarantee containment. 

Please reconsider your decision.

RE: Procedure 45-C-7125 Approval
To: O5 Council
From: Ethics Committee

Overseers, 

We have been informed of your decision to approve Procedure 45-C-7125. There was unanimous dissent across the ethics committee, but we do not yet have any grounds for a veto. We are therefore contacting you now in order to provide a warning of how this might change in the future.  

Our fear lies in SCP-7125 being limited only by the worship it receives; with enough faith, there are no limits to what this anomaly could achieve. Certainly, Procedure 45-C-7125 is designed to keep control SCP-7125. However, you control Procedure 45-C-7125, and so there is an undeniable temptation to abuse this power as your own. You’ve already created a god, after all, and what would this make you? The answer is simple: you would be a threat to be secured. An anomaly to be contained. A danger from which we can and will protect humanity. 

This is your only warning. Do not disappoint us. 

Ethic Committee
