Gothic spires of steel and methane,
Marring the once-blue skies
Seeping oil and capital

Art studios and supermarkets
Malls and coffeeshops
Corporate headquarters and government agencies

There is a poem I was shown in middle school,

Turned to statues by simple chemistry
Mother earth permanently sculpting
Her greatest heroes, whom //we//,
Jealous, depraved,
