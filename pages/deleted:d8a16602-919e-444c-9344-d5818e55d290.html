Item#: SCP-6285

Object Class: Safe

Special containment procedures: SCP-6285-1 is to be kept in a standard containment box. At least one SCP-6285-2 instance is to remain in SCP-6285-1 at any given time to avoid more SCP-6285-2 instances being produced. Any personnel caught consuming SCP-6285-2 instances outside of testing purposes will suffer repercussions.

Description: SCP-6285 refers to 2 anomalies, SCP-6285-1, SCP-6285-2, and SCP-6285-3 instances. SCP-6285-1 is a 6 pack, cardboard carrier displaying no logos, with a nutrition facts label on the back. SCP-6285-1’s anomalous properties consist of filling up with SCP-6285-2 instances in 30 minute intervals if there are no more SCP-6285-2 instances inside of SCP-6285-1.

SCP-6285-2 instances appear to be cans of [REDACTED] brand energy drink. When SCP-6285-2 is consumed by a subject1, the SCP-6285-3 instance appears to transform into their most apparent thought at the time. These changes are reversible if SCP-6285-2 is consumed again while the SCP-6285-3 instance is thinking about their form before the transformation.

SCP-6285-1 was first discovered when an undercover foundation employee stationed in the [REDACTED]2 police department heard reports that a teacher at a local elementary school was turning into a living room. When foundation officials arrived, they discovered a couch, a coffee table, a bottle of wine, and several wine glasses in place of the teacher.

Incident, SCP-6285-A: A SCP-6285-2 instance was accidentally left out in the canteen. Security personnel named [REDACTED] confused it with his energy drink. Subject was unable to recover.</textarea></pre>
