    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Name:** Dr. Philip Leighton
**Primary Alias(es):** &#34;Leicontis&#34;; &#34;Dr. Leicontis&#34;
**Clearance Level:** 2
**Primary Role:** Materials analysis, characterization, and replication

**Personnel History:** Doctor Leighton first came to the Foundation&#39;s attention when Japanese authorities reported that someone was making inquiries regarding the parent grove of [[[SCP-143]]].  When questioned, he revealed that he had obtained an antique manuscript which referenced the so-called &#34;Bladewood Grove&#34;, and due to his near-obsessive interest in swordmaking, immediately began further research in hopes of uncovering the truth behind the stories.   His persistence impressed Agent ███████ who suggested that Dr. Leighton be recruited by the Foundation.  From the interview transcript:

&gt; **Agent ███████:** &#34;Okay, okay!  I&#39;ll ask them!  Now let go of my leg, and stop it with the puppy-dog eyes - it&#39;s not cute, it&#39;s ████ing creepy!&#34;

While Dr. Leicontis has proven himself a capable researcher, and shown a surprising degree of comfort with even dangerous SCPs, his interpersonal skills could still stand some improvement.  He often tends to regard his fellow researchers as a greater threat than the anomalous objects they research, and seems to swing between timid-and-deferential and abrasive-and-hostile.  Fortunately, due to his utter ineptness at physically demanding tasks, including combat, he does not pose any actual threat to other staff.

**Note:** In light of recent incidents, Dr. Leicontis is not permitted direct access to --blade-related SCPs-- --any sharp objects-- blade-related SCPs.

**Note:** For his own safety, Dr. Leicontis should not be allowed to communicate directly with Agent Yoric without supervision.

**SCPs Catalogued:**
[[[SCP-189]]] - Hair-imitating parasite
[[[SCP-318]]] - Soul Press
[[[SCP-724]]] - Radio Raccoons
[[[SCP-941]]] - Carsickness(Research update undertaken by [[[dr-rogets-file| Dr. Roget]]])

**Research Contributions:**
[[[SCP-557]]] - Ancient Containment Site (eric_h project head)

**Other Activities:**
[[[In the Big League]]]
[[[Loop]]]

**Under Investigation:**
