Howdy!

Whether you are new to the Wiki or have been here a while, I&#39;m sure you may already be aware of some of the many Groups of Interest the Foundation deals with. As a forum critter, I often spot several drafts which try to shoehorn Groups of Interest into their articles with little rhyme or reason. Even worse, sometimes they try to write an article heavily featuring the group without really knowing anything about it! GoIs are cool, don&#39;t get me wrong. I love mixing and matching groups of interest in my articles, but to do so requires both a level of understanding of what a specific GoI represents, and what they can bring to the table from a narrative standpoint.

In this essay, I, alongside several other authors well-versed on the matter, will be offering up advice on what kind of voice, tone, and themes an article featuring a specific GoI should aim for. Keep in mind **this is not a bible or definitive guide by any means, and there is always room for exploration and deconstruction. This essay is more of a crash course and meant to provide easy to digest information not present in most GoI hubs,** alongside recommended reading for those interested in reading about a GoI or learning the basic gist of what a group stands for. I hope this helps you whether you are a reader, critter, or author.

[[size 150%]]NOTICE TO ANY INDIVIDUALS INTERESTED IN CONTRIBUTING[[/size]]
If you possess in-depth knowledge of a particular GoI and want to touch on something that was missed out on here, please PM me. **Do not add blurbs on here**. Additionally, if a new major GoI pops up or one of the minor ones becomes a major one, this essay will be updated. If enough time goes by since the GoI has risen to provenance and I have not updated this, please poke me with a stick.

Uncle Nicolini&#39;s Advice
&gt; Alexylva is a weird group of interest, and possibly the only one that the Foundation cannot interact with directly in any capacity. Alexylva University is, as the name implies, a university from a divergent timeline in which Carthage was not razed by Rome, and where Greco-Roman culture reigns supreme. They are very technologically advanced but some very simple things (such as the lower case and Arabic numerals) were never invented or universally adopted. 
&gt; 
&gt; Not an awful lot is known of Alexylva, but that means you have more room to play around in. The only rules (if they can even be referred to as such) when writing about Alexylva are as follows: Any objects found relating to Alexylva are only there by accident, they are related to Greco-Roman culture, and should function or operate in a retro-futuristic&#39; fashion. Picture trying to imagine what the future would look like while living in the first century AD. Would slaves be automated by some magic technology? Would chariot jousts be more high-stakes? What kind of souped-up monsters would be the newest thrill at the Colosseum?

Proasek&#39;s Advice

&gt; The Ambrose Restaurant, often shortened to just &#34;Ambrose,&#34; is a chain restaurant primarily found in extradimensional anomalous free ports; places like Three Portlands and Backdoor Soho. That&#39;s not to say they don&#39;t appear elsewhere, however, in fact quite a lot of their restaurants are found in normal reality, though their options are a little more restricted there. They maintain good relations with other groups, MC&amp;D and The Circus spring immediately to mind, though by their very nature they&#39;re always on the Foundation&#39;s hit list.
&gt; 
&gt; If you&#39;re looking to write for Ambrose, then there are a few simple tips for you to remember.
&gt; 
&gt; First off, always make sure the restaurant is somewhere a customer want to visit. At the end of the day, they&#39;ve got to turn a profit somehow. Other than that, and just as important as the characters and the stories they tell, is the food. You cannot forget the food. If someone&#39;s reading Ambrose, they don&#39;t want exactly what they could get with any other group, they want to see the chefs, the waiters, and most of all the bizarre dishes that one can find in any of their establishments. As far as characterization goes, you should be cautious to remember that the leadership is far more moral than that of many other GoI&#39;s. That&#39;s not to say that everyone in their employ is a pillar of justice, but for the most part, they won&#39;t do harm if it can be avoided, and Chaz is certain to veto using a human in a dish. Probably.
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; And if you&#39;re looking to read some of it, then what kept you so long?

Jacob Conwell&#39;s Advice

&gt; In a nutshell: Anderson Robotics is a paratechnology company responsible for the manufacture of anomalous androids, computer programs, cybernetics, and the like. Based in the Pacific Northwest and to a larger degree Three Portlands. The company is headed by Vincent Anderson, a skilled thaumaturge, and manipulator, and persists through a combination of espionage, supply deals with such groups as Marshall, Carter, and Dark, and simply existing out of the Foundation&#39;s range.
&gt; 
&gt; Writing Anderson Robotics pieces is a great way of exploring classical Science Fiction themes, with a thaumatological twist. Most of their products disguise their anomalous features as the product of advanced but mundane engineering—using an artificial soul to emulate human-like AI, and so on. Is it ethical to create an artificial soul to power a machine of labor if the alternative was that such a being never existed in the first place? What are the dilemmas in creating artificial intelligence to use in place of a human soul for a demonic sacrifice? What happens when your technology masters the very power you used to create it? These are the types of questions often tied up in the group that should be explored, if not necessarily answered, when you write.
&gt; 
&gt; Additionally, a huge part of the draw for Anderson Robotics is the characters. Since the company is a small group with only a few hundred people working for them, one can explore the dynamics of the workplace. Entire tale series have been created focusing on how Vincent Anderson runs his company and emotionally manipulates his workers to fulfill an internal desire to be seen as a hero and visionary. Tales have also been written that focus on the interplay between human employees and the numerous androids in the company&#39;s staff. With a Three Portlands serving as a well-established backdrop, you can really dive deep into the lives of the programmers, machinists, sales reps, and android security agents that make the company tick.

Elenee FishTruck&#39;s Advice

&gt; People often throw AWCY? into any artistic skip, which I think is really a disservice to the GoI. AWCY? is a movement, more than anything else, of making anart acceptable, or &#34;cool&#34;, in popular culture. While AWCY? is unified under that one goal, there are numerous factions and splinters in AWCY? This is somewhat fixed by the Critic system, but this only causes more problems.
&gt; 
&gt; AWCY? articles should say something about the struggle of an artist against something. Whether it be the Critic, social norms, lack of supplies, whatever. There should be something that an artist is fighting against and an artist is fighting for. Having a spooky painting with &#34;Are We Cool Yet?&#34; written on it will not fly.

Uncle Nicolini&#39;s Advice

&gt; AWCY? is very much about thinking outside the conventional norm, and this extends into the mediums anartists (anart: ana= anomalous art= artists) use to create. Performances, songs, sculptures, interpretive dance, nothing is off the table so long as it is punctuated with a flair of the anomalous. Don&#39;t be afraid to explore something new in your article, art is about breaking boundaries and exploring new mediums.
&gt; 
&gt; But the most important thing about an AWCY? piece is that they are always about something, [[[scp-3435|even when they&#39;re about nothing.]]] Every piece has a purpose; whether we, the in-universe audience or even the anartists themselves get it is up to you.

Uncle Nicolini and Gaffsey&#39;s Advice

&gt; The joy of writing a Black Queen is the infinite amount of them which exist. The Black Queens are a group consisting of the same person across timelines, universes, and worlds. They congregate in the Wanderer&#39;s Library and share close relations with the Serpent&#39;s Hand, and in some instances are even the leaders of the organization. 
&gt; 
&gt; Black Queen articles typically involve the pursuit of knowledge through multiversal collaboration. The Queens (who refer to one another as &#39;Sisters&#39;) aim to collect as many anomalous objects across the various universes and timelines which may help them in their pursuits, whatever they may be. As previously mentioned, there are infinite numbers of Black Queens, so there is no wrong way of writing one, so long as they are working together with like-minded Sisters.

Uncle Nicolini&#39;s Advice

&gt; The CI is one of the most easily adaptable GoIs in the Foundation Universe and have three popular interpretations. 
&gt; 
&gt; The first (and most popular) depicts them as a Chaotic Evil paramilitary group which does evil things for the sake of being evil. This version of the CI is typically used as cannon fodder to be mowed down or as a catch-all, unquestionably evil puppy-kicking villain. Very simple and effective when in need of a generic villain, but not very interesting.
&gt; 
&gt; The second depicts the Insurgency as a sort of Black Ops MTF which operate on behalf of the Foundation when their hands are tied and cannot do something on the books. This depiction is much more morally grey and typically would depict the internal dilemma of one having to do what may be a highly immoral or villainous act, but one that would no doubt end up benefiting the world overall.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, we have the Moral Insurgency, which are Foundation defectors members who seek to protect the world while not making morally grey compromises and have a very pragmatic approach to dealing with problems. Whereas the Foundation would keep an anomaly alive even if it were in great pain, this Insurgency would put it out of its misery. An article featuring this Insurgency would likely be seen as monsters by the outside world and the Foundation, but is operated by people who firmly believe they are doing what they must while causing as little pain as possible. 

Lazar&#39;s advice

&gt; The Chaos Insurgency is probably one of the oldest extant GOIs, and it shows. As unclenicolini has discussed, interpretations of the CI vary widely from author to author, or even year to year.  
&gt; 
&gt; A classic mistake many a new author makes regarding the CI is not understanding who they are and what they want. The CI has been so thoroughly abused as a simple, kick-the-dog unjustified Foundation antagonist that it&#39;s pretty much a discredited trope at this point, despite likely being developed for this purpose. Playing this straight in a non-humorous context is going to lead to eye-rolls and likely downvotes.
&gt; 
&gt; That&#39;s not to say the CI as an antagonist to the Foundation, or as a GOI itself, is dead or discredited. It&#39;s merely important to understand what their motivations are. MC&amp;D and Prometheus Labs pursued profit - CotBG and Sarkicists pursue their own, specific religious ends. What the CI wants is decidedly less clear, and certainly not as unified as those described above.
&gt; 
&gt; The unifying factor in all CI interpretations is that the CI is an alternative Foundation - they are organized along similar lines, have similar skills, and generally evenly matched. What causes them to differ is likely little more than a razor&#39;s edge. Less stringent ethics committee, perhaps a bit looser in testing? Or perhaps less of a focus on containment and more of an interest in utilizing those anomalies for personal benefit? Both of these are entirely valid interpretations, as are dozens more like them.
&gt; 
&gt; The CI is an extremely flexible GOI to work with. Treating them as &#39;only&#39; an unjustified Foundation antagonist is a missed opportunity.

A Random Day&#39;s Advice

&gt; There are three incarnations of the Chicago Spirit: the pre-1933 version, the pre-1990 version, and the post-1990 version. Much like cyberpunk fiction, the central connecting theme of all versions of the Chicago Spirit is &#34;high tech, low life&#34;. Fantastic people use incredible means for decidedly mundane ends: it&#39;s a GOI that uses submachine guns against magicians and summons demons to help rob banks. At the same time, do not confuse the Chicago Spirit with Marshall, Carter, and Dark. MC&amp;D represent the peak of late-stage capitalism -  the members of the Chicago Spirit are perpetually hungry, operating at street-level and interacting with the common people. 
&gt; 
&gt; When writing for the Pre-1933 Chicago Spirit, you want to consider the culture and context of early 20th century America: World War 1, the Great Depression, Prohibition, film noir, Al Capone, etc. are all events, people, and themes that could play a role in this era&#39;s Chicago Spirit. Think of the celebrity worship and romanticism surrounding 1930s gangster culture and use that in your work. The most defining article to represent this era would be the tale &#34;Hartliss Detective Agency&#34;. The Pre-1990 Chicago Spirit is much more freeform. Really, the only rule when writing in this time period is that there IS no Chicago Spirit - at least not any recognized one. The most defining article for this era would be the tale &#34;Zeitgeist&#34;.  The Post-1990 Chicago Spirit draws on elements of postmodern literature and culture. It&#39;s more playful and more cynical than the prior eras, incorporating stylistic elements of comic books, anime, and music, and blending them with themes from neo-noir, cyberpunk, and urban fantasy fiction. The most defining article for this era would be the tale &#34;Hypervelocity&#34;.


Rounderhouse&#39;s Advice

&gt; The Chicago Spirit are (in-universe) the first Group of Interest catalogued by the Foundation. They were a gang from Chicago that made their name using anomalous technologies to supplement their strength, and grew massive during the Prohibition. They were primarily operated by one Richard Chappell, said to be a reality-bender (Though a popular interpretation says that Chappell was a non-anomalous human, and all reality-bending was done by his mysterious partner-in-crime.). Anyway, the Chicago Spirit rapidly fell in power and collapsed a few years after Prohibition ended.
&gt;  
&gt; The Chicago Spirit&#39;s aesthetic, tone, and style is deeply rooted in Prohibition-era American culture. With the absence of the Prohibition, the Spirit was rapidly on its way out. Remember that when writing for them. Everything they do is influenced by the viewpoints and technologies of 20s America. When writing for them, consider what an individual from back then&#39;s thoughts would be on the matter. Even their language is dated back to that era.
&gt; 
&gt; A constant theme for the Spirit is greed. They&#39;re willing to commit crimes for profit, there&#39;s no doubt about that, but they won&#39;t go out of their way to bring harm upon someone who doesn&#39;t threaten them without a good reason. The reason is usually money. They&#39;re also greedy for more power. Expansion is //very// important to the Spirit, because they know if they make themselves brittle, the UIU (which was a much more real threat back then) and the Foundation could destroy them. The Spirit was a powerful player in the anomalous underworld, but even then, the legitimate organizations were far more powerful than them.

&gt; Church of the Broken God is Machine Worship viewed through the lens that the physical world of flesh and bone is inherently evil in some way, whether it be actively malicious or through some intangible quality of sin. The original intent wasn&#39;t that it was entirely machine-based, but it grew into that. They don&#39;t call themselves the Church of the Broken God; the Foundation gave them that name. It&#39;s like calling Christianity the Church of the Tortured Criminal; technically correct, but not the name they give themselves.

NatVoltaic&#39;s Advice

&gt; The Church of the Second Hytoth and other Ortothan groups are wide and varied in beliefs, structure, and composition, but they all share one commonality: they refuse to give up. Even with all but one of their gods dead, they strive to keep Rakmou-leusan alive, constantly working to spread their beliefs and aid in the fight against the Voruteut. They are certain they will win.
&gt; 
&gt; This won&#39;t always be apparent in articles, though. Tone-wise the stories involving the Ortothans can be far from hopeful, some veering hard into [[[SCP-2821|existential]]] [[[SCP-2742|horror]]], and individual Ortothans themselves could easily lose faith in what seems to be a ceaseless, worsening conflict. However, Ortothan groups as whole do not consider failure an option. And if [[[SCP-1548|failure]]] does happen they will still keep going. This perseverance in the face of cosmic horrors and universal stakes is part of what sets Ortothans apart from other groups involving the eldritch, and keeping it in mind is key to writing the group well.

&gt; Also, whatever you do, don&#39;t write the Church of the Second Hytoth as a generic evil blood cult. The group was intended from the start to be an inversion on blood cults (being pacifistic instead of violent and having a justified reason for blood rites beyond &#34;BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD&#34;) and, while there is nothing wrong with writing other Ortothan groups as despicable (alien Ortothans are bound to have different morals than humans, for instance), the Church and the majority of Ortothan groups will not act that way. Daevites are more suited towards it than the Church is.

&gt; In a way, dado is the very definition of the ideal capitalist. He cuts corners where they can afford to be cut (even if he is sometimes a little sloppy) and ultimately delivers what he considers is customer satisfaction at a low-low price while still churning a profit. Despite his origins as a funny pill man, dado has graduated into a diverse entrepreneur willing to try his hand at any business and do something weird in the process.

Elenee FishTruck&#39;s Advice

&gt; Wondertainment, above all else, has the child&#39;s best interest in heart. Despite any shady under-goings within Wondertainment, no one in the company wants to actively hurt or emotionally damage children. As such, any malfunctions with Wondertainment products are wholly unintentional and are likely the result of an accidental oversight or pushing the product to its limits.  Wondertainment products are also inherently over-the-top and wacky, much like if a child designed them. 
&gt; 
&gt; If you&#39;re going to write a Wondertainment product as an article, you&#39;ll have to keep in mind that Wondertainment only makes mistakes, never directly seeks harm, and Wondertainment will try a variety of different products, from games to food to toys to amusement parks, to keep kids not only engaged in play but also to keep them wondering. That being said, never be afraid to veer into sad, scary, or other subject matter that doesn&#39;t fit into the innocent facade. Besides the obvious side-effects of certain Wondertainment products, Wondertainment isn&#39;t afraid to get his hands dirty to make products (cough cough Little Misters cough cough), and that can lead to a deeper conflict.

DarkStuff&#39;s Advice:

&gt; This might be weird coming from me, the creator of the What a Wonderful World canon, but there //are// multiple interpretations of Wondertainment, and though I support and enjoy Elenee&#39;s interpretation above me more than the alternative, the original form of Dr. Wondertainment still exists. I don&#39;t remember exactly where this quote is, but trust me that my paraphrased version is accurate enough:
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Dr. Wondertainment is like the Warden from Superjail. He does everything on a whim, and doesn&#39;t really think about the consequences of his actions. Or perhaps he doesn&#39;t care. Whereas the Warden uses the prison population as his &#39;test subjects&#39; to fulfill whatever his desire is at that moment, Dr. Wondertainment uses his company and children.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; This is from CryogenChaos, the originator of Dr. Wondertainment. While I enjoy a more caring, cutesy Wondertainment, //this// is the mentality that created, say, the original Little Misters. While I am more happy to see Elenee&#39;s interpretation being written about, personally, I also want this page to be a little less biased, and the real thing of note is that a //good portion// of the articles on the site show this darker, less caring, more &#34;power trip&#34; type Dr. Wondertainment. And if you wish to write that, know that you are backed by the history of the site.

&gt; The Factory gives no sympathy. It&#39;s like a monster manifested as an industrial hell. It doesn&#39;t just overwork its employees, it consumes them, and it mass produces objects not out of customer satisfaction but out of pure capitalistic need. As such, most Factory products are rough around the edges, have horrifying effects, and are generally cold and distant like a manager looking over his thousands of of workers.
&gt; 
&gt; There&#39;s little to no hope for those in the Factory. Once you&#39;re in, you never get out. That great turmoil, that horrendous fate, should come across when you&#39;re writing a Factory item. You should think not only &#34;Why did they make this?&#34; but also &#34;Who is this for?&#34; Factory items are made from the worst of humanity and should bring out the worst in humanity.

&gt; That&#39;s not to say they&#39;re not driven. The Factory does what it does with a (quite literally) inhuman drive, and most probably wants to keep doing what they&#39;re doing for as long as time allows. Indeed, the Factory is often associated with the cutthroat robber baron &#34;pioneers&#34; of the industrial revolution, and operates much like 19th-century factories were wont to do. But outside of consuming the world and regurgitating products, it simply does not care.
&gt; 
&gt; The consumption/production cycle of the Factory is not a means to some mundane end, like improving humanity or even just making money; it is what the Factory //wants// to do. The Factory will eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and eat until it can eat no more, converting raw material and humanity into things to be consumed. In turn, these products will allow the Factory more food, and it will continue chomping at reality like an industrial cancer. Only three things exist to the Factory: consumers, the consumed, and the Factory itself, and even the line between &#34;consumer&#34; and &#34;consumed&#34; will eventually blur.
&gt; 
&gt; When the sun goes cold and Earth goes lifeless, the Factory will consume the ground beneath itself. When the last being in the universe hangs itself upon a dead tree, the Factory will cannibalize its lifeless corpse for raw materials. When the last star dies, the last planet crumbles, the last cosmic cloud disperses, when the last bit of warmth is devoured by entropy, when at last some deific being comes across an empty existential space to make the universe anew, the Factory will be there, waiting for seconds.

Elenee FishTruck&#39;s Advice
&gt; There are two aspects that I believe define Fifthism: Surrealism and Blind Devotion. Surrealism is the most obvious one. The constant themes of &#34;following the smoke&#34;, &#34;becoming one with the stars&#34;, and &#34;entering the Fifth World&#34; are all very weird and surreal ideas because they come from an alien point of view. Fifthism, in essence, is the worship of something out of this universe, something so wrong in our context of the universe that we must use the stars to even begin to compare the idea to it. Your article should embrace the craziness.
&gt; 
&gt; The second and less obvious attribute is blind devotion. A common theme with Fifthist articles is the worship and heavy sponsorship of some vague thing, like a religion, ideal, concept, or product. This is exemplified in works such as SCP-1425 and SCP-1982, which directly parody modern religious movements like Scientology and Evangelicalism to a horrifying extreme. In your article, there should be something that the people blindly follow, such as the examples listed above, that they&#39;d die for just to salvage a piece of it, like the worship of the Cosmic Starfish itself.

dolphinslugchugger&#39;s Advice
&gt; there are two major schools to GAW articles. the first is oldschool, the second is newschool. in both schools the in-universe principles of gamers against weed stand pretty firm:
&gt; --1. being gay and doing crimes--
&gt; 1. pacifism
&gt; 2. leftism
&gt; 3. personal meaning
&gt; 4. meme
&gt; 
&gt; the main out of universe principle of gamers against weed is hands down characterization. Gamers Against Weed articles should above all be driven by characterization, whether that be through interpersonal interaction, mostly oldschool, or more direct exploration of selfhood, more newschool.
&gt; 
&gt; now, what&#39;s the difference?
&gt; 
&gt; in oldschool, meme typically takes the wheel in stead of leftism, typically ranging from 100%-40% of a given article; personal exploration is frequently nonexistent, but can be included. typically one or two characters take most of the focus if that&#39;s included.
&gt; 
&gt; the important thing that you want to know if you&#39;re doing oldschool is to have a rock solid understanding of either the extant characters, if you choose to only use them, or the new characters, if you choose to invent new ones. i&#39;m not kidding when i say that most GAW characters that are established have had around four people collaborating on their creation and backstories
&gt; 
&gt; in newschool memes take a huge backseat to leftist action or personal exploration, with most of newschool ranging from 5-15% memes.
&gt; 
&gt; newschool typically is rooted either in established characters or a new character and the established cast. same advice for oldschool applies, but you can get away with knowing only a few characters well if you take this approach.
&gt; 
&gt; THE TAKEAWAY:
&gt; 
&gt; they arent just dumbass memers or gamers so don&#39;t write them like that one mountain dew article did for the love of god

stormbreath&#39;s advice:
&gt; One of the big problems with the GOC is that there are two dramatically different interpretations of them, which tend to have somewhat equal amounts of visibility on the site. There&#39;s such a substantial difference between these two versions that it&#39;s hard to reconcile them, and some works even have both, at the same time.
&gt; 
&gt; The first is the classic GOC, which is defined as the &#34;Destroy, destroy, destroy&#34; alternative to the Foundation. They don&#39;t give a shit about morality or anything, just destroying every last trace of the paranormal. This version of the GOC tends to be somewhat genocidal towards reality-benders, blindly kill the paranormal, and are just generally evil. This is the GOC you tend to see in a lot of earlier works, as well as works that don&#39;t greatly feature them. They tend to be a rather shallow version.
&gt; 
&gt; The second is what happens when writers realize they said the GOC was a **UN** organization and think &#34;Maybe having a UN group that commits war crimes on a daily basis doesn&#39;t make sense.&#34; This is a GOC that acknowledges the paranormal, has paranormal members, and is less violent overall to it. Yes, they still tend to the liquidation of the hostile parathreat, but they don&#39;t care so much about benign. This GOC tends to exist in worlds where the paranormal is common enough that they&#39;re still busy just focusing on the overtly dangerous. Stories that feature them tend to be stories explictly about them, or that have them working with the Foundation in a large role.

Roget and Uncle Nicolini&#39;s Advice
&gt; GRU-P were a paranormal organization based out of the Soviet Union. Unlike the other national paranormal organizations of their time, GRU-P did not worry themselves with policing the paranormal or militarizing it. Instead, they turned the anomalous into weapons and tools for espionage. They are cold, calculating, efficient, and never show their full hand. Whereas the GOC would charge in guns blazing, GRU-P would observe from a distance and investigate before performing a strike with surgical precision. Knowledge is power, and GRU-P knows a lot.
&gt; 
&gt; Their decline was a slow and steady one, which turned into a tailspin following the Soviet economic crisis of the early 80&#39;s. Within ten years, the Soviet Union collapsed, and GRU-P along with them. Many of their resources, facilities, and personnel fell into GOC and Foundation control. Like IJAMEA, there may still be some holdouts hiding in the Siberian wilderness or somewhere in plain sight, their numbers are small and continue to dwindle.
&gt; 
&gt; GRU-P lend themselves well to espionage thrillers, nightmarish science experiments, bizarre documents, and themes of structural decay. Though they likely wouldn&#39;t fully trust the Foundation or GOC (as they swear no allegiance to any particular country), working with them would certainly not be out of the question. As you may imagine, they are the enemy of the UIU and make an excellent foil for them in Cold War settings. 
&gt; 
&gt; One last thing: It&#39;s very easy to portray Russians as villains. Hell, most Western media depicts them as such. This is not the case, however. GRU-P are not evil. They are an organization attempting to ensure the long-term survival of their nation in a world full of enemies and real-life monsters.

Peppersghost&#39;s Advice
&gt; Herman Fuller&#39;s Circus of the Disquieting is a magical circus. Herman Fuller himself was known to exploit and occasionally enslave anomalies for entertainment and profit. He&#39;s since gone missing, and the new management has tried to make the Circus a refuge for outcasts. They always seem to be a step ahead of the Foundation, and no agent has ever seen the Circus firsthand.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition to being an excuse for going ham on the Creepy Circus Aesthetic, Herman Fuller articles tend to involve themes of social ostracism and the ways that outcasts are manipulated and exploited. Even when they band together to form makeshift families, things aren&#39;t always perfect or healthy.
&gt;  
&gt; Do: Make it weird. Most of the Circus attractions are either dark twists on traditional sideshow performers or bizarre monstrosities that a sane person probably wouldn&#39;t think to use for entertainment.
&gt; 
&gt; Don&#39;t: Make the circus overtly malicious. The main goal has always been to entertain guests (and make cash), and never violence for violence&#39;s sake. Sure, they may have harmed guests a time or two, but there were extenuating circumstances.

mlister&#39;s advice:

&gt; The Horizon Initiative is marked by strife. It&#39;s fundamentally an implausible premise that exists in spite of itself. Just like how real-world religions struggle with syncretism and interfaith outreach, the diversity of the Initiative proves just as much a challenge as it is a strength. 
&gt; 
&gt; What does this mean for writing it? Well, it gives good avenues for stories on people who have to overcome their differences to get things done. And avenues for stories on intra-organizational politics and petty squabbling. If you want to write about a unified HI, you&#39;re going to have to write about the goodwill and love of others that is the heart of each Abrahamic religion, and how this can overcome deep-seated differences. Else, you write about how the more militant members of these faiths (These exist in real life! Don&#39;t be afraid to write about them!) find common ground in a common enemy. With all the existentially dangerous para-religions in the Foundationverse, there&#39;s a lot of interesting interactions waiting to be written about!

Uncle Nicolini&#39;s Advice

&gt; IJAMEA is an officially disbanded GoI dedicated to the research of the paranormal. They were a branch of the Empire&#39;s military, meaning they often weaponized what they contained. Similar to the GOC, if it wasn&#39;t useful or moldable into something useful, it was typically either killed or thrown into a pit with no way out.
&gt; 
&gt; Though there are echoes of IJAMEA still hanging around in the modern world (like the Chicago Spirit), this organization was at the height of its power during the Second World War. In Japan, there are Kakure Shogun (&#34;hidden general&#34;), which are private citizens who hold loyalty to the goals of IJAMEA in secrecy. Scattered across the world are Jirai (&#34;landmines&#34;), who, much like the real-life Japanese holdouts who refused to surrender, zealously fight for a long-dead organization.
&gt; 
&gt; Articles featuring IJAMEA should focus on the organization&#39;s goal: Victory for the Japanese Empire. They do what is most beneficial to them without concerning themselves with how it will affect the rest of the world. They do not try, and they do not surrender. They simply //do.//

&gt; Science is the vehicle by which man attains mastery over nature.

Our work here has proven instrumental to expanding our knowledge, and to securing the future of our nation.

Uncle Nicolini&#39;s Advice

&gt; The Manna Charitable Foundation, as the name implies, are a non-profit charity operated mostly by volunteers which seek to provide aid via anomalous means. Due to their relatively small size, they lack the means to create anomalous technologies/items on their own. For this reason, they rely on outside parties to provide them with donations, which they utilize in as beneficial a way as possible. Though they enjoy relatively good relations with most other GoIs, they are at constant odds with the Foundation due to the threat they pose to the Masquerade. 
&gt; 
&gt; When writing a Manna Charitable article, one must always keep in mind that they are a benevolent group. MCF would never purposefully inflict harm on anyone nor would they ever act out of malice, commit an act of violence, or possess weapons. This does not, however, mean they are infallible. The world is a twisted place and may not like or even want MCF&#39;s aid, and the volunteers they are staffed by may have some ill intent. 
&gt; 
&gt; As MCF is one of the most under-written GoIs on the site there&#39;s a lot about them that isn&#39;t set in stone, but this just means there are less creative restrictions. Take the ball and run with it! What if there was a power struggle within the MCF? Maybe they butt heads with the Insurgency or another similar group? There&#39;s a lot of potentially unexplored territory here.

&gt; The dead cannot be repeat customers and the veil keeps anomalies rare and sought after. 
&gt; 
&gt; When writing MC&amp;D you need to think about how people would act in a setting where profit is the primary motive. Ask yourself: how do you think people would act if there was a world where every sci-fi and fantasy trope was true and people could buy that magic and technology for themselves?
&gt; 
&gt; A lot of MC&amp;D works involve cooperation with the Foundation, and more than a few have the two organizations at odds over certain items. Remember that, more often than not, the Foundation and MC&amp;D are aligned in their tactics and core goals. MC&amp;D might very well participate in saving the world alongside the Foundation. But when it&#39;s over, instead of putting the world back together they&#39;ll think how best to make a dollar off the ruins.

&gt; Sacrificing a human soul is hard work. Those with experience will tell you, it&#39;s never as easy as you think it&#39;s going to be. Maybe you need an innocent soul but you can&#39;t bring yourself to kill a child. Maybe you need to sacrifice a warrior but you don&#39;t want to lose people bringing him in. MC&amp;D understands your difficulties. It&#39;s why we&#39;ve started to develop artificial souls like this one.

&gt; 
&gt; We offer our sincere condolences and deepest sympathy on your loss. May the outpouring of sympathy, the kind acts of friends and strangers, and the comfort in knowing that your loss is felt by many help you through this difficult time.

HotColes&#39; Advice:

&gt; &#34;Nobody&#34; is one of the more complex GoI&#39;s referenced on the wiki, as there isn&#39;t a set-in-stone portrayal of the GoI unlike, say, The Chaos Insurgency or Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions. A majority of people often consider &#34;Nobody&#34; to be just one individual wearing a fedora and a trenchcoat; while this is a version of &#34;Nobody&#34;, there is actually a variety of different versions of Nobody depending on how the author portrays them. 
&gt; 
&gt; One of the things for certain about Nobody&#39;s lore is that they are unable to affect the world in a way that others can. One person could do X and could result in Y, but Nobody could do the same and would ultimately seem as though they never did anything at all.
&gt; 
&gt; As it says on the hub page, the reader is never completely certain of Nobody&#39;s motivation whenever they make an appearance. The core concept around the GoI is &#34;mystery&#34;, taking the concept of the word &#34;nobody&#34; and making it as literal as possible. From the Foundation&#39;s perspective, they&#39;re not even certain exactly what &#34;Nobody&#34; is- are they an individual? An organization? Try and play on that idea.

Tufto&#39;s Advice:

&gt; The key thing to remember when writing ORIA is that they are not simply to contain or destroy anomalies, but to weaponise them. ORIA is not an Islamist group or anything of that sort, but a broad-church group of secularists, Islamists, anti-colonialists and many others, all sharing a specific goal: the protection of Iran and the Islamic world more broadly. They are entirely pragmatic, and this is the driving philosophy behind their actions.
&gt; 
&gt; Beyond this, though, there is significant flexibility in how ORIA can be portrayed, largely owing to the fact that its nature as an organisation has not been sketched out very precisely. Their GoI documents are not concerned with specific anomalies but are instead memoranda concerned with particular Projects, keeping that pragmatic approach by describing potential uses rather than things. Always remember to keep an Islamic and perhaps an anti-colonialist slant to them, but don&#39;t be afraid to experiment- it&#39;s a GoI that could certainly use some fresh blood writing unique content.

Elenee FishTruck&#39;s Advice

&gt; The Oneiroi Collective is one of the more directionless GoIs because of their primary medium, dreams. As such, we need to know what dreams are like to understand what Oneiroi is like. It&#39;s surreal, obviously, with many elements that wouldn&#39;t make sense at all in the real world and are very imaginative. However, dreams are also structured. For how weird a dream is, there&#39;s always a set in stone outline for how it&#39;ll go, like a storybook. 
&gt; 
&gt; So, how can we apply this to Oneiroi? Well, have fun with your ideas. Don&#39;t be afraid to let your imagination flow, because anything is possible in the realm of dreams. However, have a story in mind as well. The Oneiroi Collective helps people with their dreams, but what happens when things go awry is a story all on its own. There should be distant but comprehensible logic at play here, like the dreams themselves.

NatVoltaic&#39;s Advice

&gt; Part of what makes Pattern Screamers one of the most challenging groups to write for on the wiki is just how, well, //vague// they are. No articles present a consensus canon on them, and if you ask any author about them chances are they&#39;ll give you their own unique headcanon about what they are.  Pattern Screamers are in essence the staple unknowable existential/cosmic horror of the wiki.
&gt; 
&gt; So, what //can// you go off of when writing them?
&gt; 
&gt; Pattern Screamer articles all tie into some of the same central themes, which give a loose idea of what they may be and bring the articles into a cohesive whole. Some of them are:
&gt; * Database/informational corruption.
&gt; * Existence beyond reality (or existence in [[[SCP-1795|unknown corners of space]]]).
&gt;  * Variation: [[[SCP-000|entrapment beyond reality.]]]
&gt; * [[[SCP-3930|Nonexistence.]]]
&gt; * Desire for [[[SCP-739|attention]]] towards their existence.
&gt; * Destabilization of [[[SCP-2528|existence]]]/[[[SCP-2821|reality]]].
&gt; * [[[SCP-S|Hatred]]] towards humanity, existence, and/or the Foundation.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course none of that is to say you should write Pattern Screamers just by following these themes while ignoring specific headcanons. If your ideas align best with a certain headcanon or if a certain headcanon inspires you the most then, by all means, write according to them. Hell, it&#39;s bound that you may develop your own unique headcanon based on the themes too. These are only meant to serve as guidelines for writing Pattern Screamers so your work stays consistent with the rest of the articles on them.
&gt; 
&gt; End of the day, there is a fair amount of leeway when it comes to writing Pattern Screamers. A word of caution, though: &#34;unknown horrors from beyond&#34; can only stay interesting for so long. Eventually, new, intriguing details and narrative directions will be necessary to avoid treading the same ground. If you can keep that in mind while writing Pattern Screamers then you&#39;ll be set.

A Random Day and Greenwolf&#39;s Advice

&gt; PL started out as a parascience research company in the late 1800s, sort of trying to be the Edison or Bell Company of paratech. They worked closely with national governments, as a sort of paranormal defense contractor and by the middle of the 20th century, were a major force in their own right. At their peak, PL was a globe-spanning conglomerate that had its fingers in just about everything imaginable, imagine, like, General Electric and Boeing combined. While they were still huge suppliers of paratech to normalcy organizations, they also had a consumer market at that point. You&#39;d buy a Prometheus microwave and never even know that it was powered by ghosts.
&gt; 
&gt; They were able to get away with this because they were, essentially too big to fail.
&gt; But then the cold war ended, the demand for paratech dropped, and some bad financial decisions meant that they failed anyway. This didn&#39;t happen overnight, it was much more like a normal corporate breakup. The parent company was dissolved, and its subsidiaries and assets sold off. Some of them became independent companies still operating in the paratech market, some of them were bought out by rivals or normalcy orgs, and some of them just stopped doing business. The upshot of all that is that, while PLabs proper is defunct, there&#39;s a lot of PL still operating, just under different names like Titan Consumer Appliances and Electronics. There&#39;s no definitive list of PL-successor companies, and there&#39;s a lot of room for new ones to pop up.
&gt; 
&gt; Thematically, the big thing with PL is reenacting the Prometheus myth. their whole goal was to steal the anomalous fire and figured out how to use it to benefit mankind. In their later years, this would be somewhat lessened by the inevitable consequences of being a for-profit corporation and globe-spanning conglomerate, but the core tenet of PL was always, from the beginning, trying to use the paranormal for the benefit of mankind, and hey, maybe make a quick buck or two off of it.
&gt; 
&gt; The other thing is that they were //good at it//. Yeah, they eventually got burned, but for a full century, PL was on the cutting edge of parascience. They took risks, and sometimes that backfired, but a lot of the time it paid off. One of the tropes of old school PL was &#34;lol, they screwed up because they were dumb&#34;, b/c it was popular to give GOIs the idiot ball back then to make the Foundation look competent, but for modern PL, if they fail, it&#39;s not because they screwed up, but because they were unlucky, or sabotaged, or whatever. Yeah, they make mistakes, but most of their biggest failures would be as a result of external forces.

[[image sarkic-cults.png style=&#34;width:25%;&#34;]]
[[/=]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;Show Writing Advice&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]

Metaphysician&#39;s Advice
&gt; Sarkic cults represent the diverse and usually isolated remnants of an ancient faith. At first glance, they resemble “flesh worshipers” due to their fixation with the body and corporeal augmentation. In truth, the flesh is but a means to an end. They regard organic matter as the corrupt tool of malevolent alien gods but one that can be used by mortals to rival the power of these cosmic horrors. Sarkicism comes from the traditions of the Grand Karcist Ion, its long-vanished prophet and founder. 
&gt; 
&gt; The religion began with the noble goal of liberating and uniting humanity – and bringing an end to the gods. Since the fall of their civilization, the faith has degenerated into these various cults. Some still hold to some semblance of morality but most have twisted these traditions in the name of fanatical devotion or selfish ambition. Though there exist many Sarkic cults, most can be divided into Proto-Sarkic and Neo-Sarkic.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Proto-Sarkites are commonly depicted as isolationist, preferring a rustic lifestyle outside of modern civilization (though this is not always the case). These cults take many influences from European Paganism and Siberian shamanism and have close ties to the land. They value hardship, self-sacrifice, and collectivism. Their approach to the Sarkic faith is prone to fundamentalism and their use of anomalies makes them a threat to the Foundation&#39;s goal of normalcy. They revere Ion and his Klavigar (Nadox, Saarn, Orok, and Lovataar; basically akin to apostles), celebrating them on holy days and making sacrifices in their name. They regard Ion as a messianic figure but are divided on his current state, with some regarding him as having transcended to godhood and others believing he had sacrificed himself for the good of humanity. 
&gt; 
&gt; Neo-Sarkites are cosmopolitan, affluent, and lack the superstitions associated with Proto-Sarkites. It is better to think of them as occult organizations, rather than true religions. They worship only power, ignoring much of the doctrine and mythology of the original faith. Though they descend from the same tradition and exploit the same anomalies, they are in many ways the antithesis of Sarkicism. They value ambition and selfish desire, willing to sacrifice the many for the benefit of the few; they see the world through a social-Darwinist lens, merging fleshcrafting and eugenics with terrifying results. The first Neo-Sarkites descend from European nobles who learned of Sarkicism through Proto-Sarkites kept as court-sorcerers and it quickly spread through politically advantageous marriages. Modern Neo-Sarkites are usually involved in business, finance, and other lucrative professions – though many of the older aristocrats still prefer to live among their crumbling castles and manors. 
&gt; 
&gt; “Fleshcrafting” is central to all Sarkic cults, though the degree varies between cults and individuals. The most extreme examples are usually found among Neo-Sarkites, due to their sadism and libertine interests. This can be used to alter the self and others in both monstrous and disturbingly beautiful ways; it can also be employed to create new life and seize control of any organic matter. It is important to remember that traditional Sarkic cults regard the gods (known to them as Archons) as their creators but also as something to be opposed. Gods are to be “devoured” so that humanity might rise above them. However, Neo-Sarkites are perfectly willing to serve these cosmic horrors if it benefits them. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Ancient texts should be presented as having righteous and benevolent goals, even if the means seem utterly alien or even abhorrent. Sarkites are best depicted as having the same positive and negative traits as any other human though their traditions are a window into something truly nightmarish and cosmic in scale.

The Great Hippo&#39;s Advice
&gt; Like the Church of the Broken God, Sarkicism posits that our world is broken -- and describes a path to fix it. But while the Church pursues idealized solutions through external artifice and abstraction, Sarkics look within: Flesh, bone, sinew, thought -- and the very soul.
&gt; 
&gt; The first mistake people make with Sarkics is presuming they&#39;re just fleshmancers. They //deal// in flesh, but only because they deal in reality -- and a significant portion of our reality is made of flesh. The second mistake people make is presuming all Sarkics are evil. They //can// be, sure; they can be a lot of things. But at their core, Sarkics are &#39;doctors&#39;. The illness they treat? The human condition. Their cure? Apotheosis.
&gt; 
&gt; There are two branches of Sarkicism: Proto-Sarkics are the original tradition, tracing their roots back thousands of years. Druids, shamans, and other mystics -- they seek apotheosis through the sacrifice of the few for the many. Neo-Sarkics are the newcomers, they&#39;re a syncretic fusion of Proto-Sarkic beliefs, science, and pseudo-science (such as eugenics). They seek apotheosis through the sacrifice of the many for the few. 
&gt; 
&gt; The tension between these movements defines Sarkicism in the modern era.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Recurring themes include cycles of death and rebirth, resurrection, consumption of one&#39;s fore-bearers and/or God(s), evolution, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncretism syncretism], and (particularly in the case of Neo-Sarkicism) the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_to_power will to power]

Zyn&#39;s Advice
&gt; The Serpent&#39;s Hand is pretty much the go-to GoI for magic. Think old-time wizards, street magicians, caretakers of magical beasts, anyone who sees the supernatural as natural and believes that these qualities should be considered the norm, and people shouldn&#39;t be afraid of what&#39;s different. Sometimes SH peeps hang out in this cool library that contains all the books ever written, and all the books that will never be written. They were kicked out for a period of time before, but made it back in and they&#39;re cool now. But one must note that the Serpent&#39;s Hand does not own the Wanderers&#39; Library, nor do they have any special sort of authority or claim over it.
&gt; 
&gt; One important thing to remember is that all it takes to become a member of the Serpent&#39;s Hand is considering yourself a member. Just as there are Serpent&#39;s Hand associates who are bird shamans and mantis swordsmiths, there are SH members who are completely normal humans who just happen to find the extraordinary pretty neat and are willing to embrace it. SH members don&#39;t need to be super powerful or super exceptional to be part of a group. Additionally, that means that not all SH members are the same—there are some splinter groups that are powerful and hostile and would happily go toe-to-toe with the Foundation or other GoIs to bust their friends out of lockups, but there are also a lot of more peaceful folks who just want to talk to their magical fish without someone wrecking their picnics. Some of them have simple stories, others are part of eons-long histories involving mythological deities and centuries-long conflict. There&#39;s a lot of room for fantastical elements here, just make sure you&#39;re not ripping off D&amp;D or the latest YA novel.

Captain Kirby&#39;s Advice

&gt; SPC is more or less a vehicle for humor. The idea is stupid (in the good way), the articles are stupid (in the good way) and the general ambiance is just out to make the read smile at how stupid this whole thing is (in the good way). 
&gt; 
&gt; Essentially, whenever I&#39;m writing an SPC article, I essentially need to start from an idea where my first reaction to it is &#34;god this is stupid.&#34; The key from there is to essentially write the article such that everything you think is stupid, is taken seriously in-universe. 
&gt; 
&gt; Now, how exactly you portray the organization can vary a lot from here. Some people like to make them incredibly high tech and serious, a much closer foil to the foundation. Then there are others who play them off more as jocks or stereotypical &#34;surfer dudes&#34;. Honestly, this is entirely up to how you want your article to read, and your style of writing, but the one thing they have in common is that //punching sharks is important work.//
&gt; 
&gt; Because it is, and anyone who says otherwise will be beaten for being a shark sympathizer.

&gt; But where?

&gt; From the corner of his eye, a massive form in the shape of a fighter jet exited the clouds; gale-force wind buffeted its fins. Gægr twisted around. The titan slammed into his underbelly at astounding speeds.

&gt; I know we&#39;re going through a lot of changes. A lot of what you&#39;ve done at the Center is being turned on its head. But you must remember: the enemy is still very real, and has probably sharpened their teeth since I wrote this. It&#39;s us against those fuckers every step of the way. We still have to get out of bed in the morning, put our shoes on, and fight some fin.

Greenwolf&#39;s Advice
&gt; The UIU is another one of those GOIs that got the idiot ball early on in the site&#39;s history. Highly trained federal agents were cast as bumbling buffoons who only served to showcase how clever the Foundation was.
&gt; 
&gt; The big thing with the UIU is that their limits are much more to do with politics than with their competency or ability. Their funding is limited, and there are a lot of legal constraints they have to follow. While maintaining the Veil is a key priority for them, their major mission is paranormal policing. There&#39;s too much weird stuff out there to just lock everything up in containment cells, so the easiest way to keep it hidden is to provide a safe, ordered paranormal community. Hence the Hoover Mandate, wherein the US basically says &#34;hands off&#34; to the other normalcy organizations, which is why paranormal enclaves like 3ports and Backdoor Soho can exist. 3ports is, really, just a single giant containment cell for tens of thousands of wizards and anartists and everything else, and it&#39;s the UIU&#39;s job to maintain order and make sure that they don&#39;t all kill each other.
&gt; 
&gt; While they probably don&#39;t have the firepower to get into a straight-shooting war with the Foundation (not without seriously compromising the Veil, anyway), the fact that the paranormal enclaves //work// to keep the paranormal community segregated from normalcy plays a big part in why they are willing to abide by the Hoover Mandate. 
&gt; 
&gt; They&#39;re the wizard police, basically, at least within the US, both in the sense that they police wizards and in that they are wizards.
 


Ihp&#39;s Advice
&gt; The UIU&#39;s main weakness is the fact that nobody in the US government gives a good goddamn about them.  They were formed by Hoover, and are largely seen as an artifact of his paranoia. The Foundation keeps it afloat through interference with the congressional budget, and they provide a valuable service in taking on anomalies that aren&#39;t worth the Foundation&#39;s time-- when they&#39;ve got a Keter-class to deal with in Kansas, they don&#39;t care about an anomalous genetic experimentation ring in Brooklyn. 
&gt; 
&gt; They&#39;re law enforcement above anything else, and despite the fact that people think of them as the X-Files, they have the authority to do a lot of law enforcement things-- arrest, investigate, arrest *and* investigate (there&#39;s a distinction there-- agents can either arrest or investigate, but special agents can do both), get warrants for things like camera footage and searching the premises. They can work with other parts of the FBI- SCP-3256, for instance, has them working with the Behavioral Analysis Unit, the Evidence Response Team, and at least one crime lab. 
&gt; 
&gt; Keep in mind that the UIU is probably not the only US Government agency that deals with the paranormal. Like, the Navy might have a sea-monster fighting unit, the National Guard might deal with paranormal hostage situations, that kind of thing.

&gt; Because we&#39;re all American. None of us are some little hooligan you had to recruit because they were in the right place at the right time.

Uncle Nicolini&#39;s Advice

&gt; A lot of people think Wilson&#39;s is a happy-go-lucky GoI where nothing ever goes wrong, and they&#39;d only be half-right. Yes, the general attitude of most WWS articles is &#39;happy-go-lucky&#39;, but they are far from perfect. Due to their lack of experience, small budget, lack of manpower, and relative Luddite status, WWS are more prone to failure than most other GoIs.
&gt; 
&gt; What sets them apart, however, is their willingness to dust themselves off and try again. What they lack in just about everything else they make up for in spirit; these are people who love their job and are doing it because they believe they are doing the right thing. Keep in mind that &#39;the right thing&#39; is subjective here, as they might just be doing more harm than good sometimes.
&gt; 
&gt; To put it simply, WWS is about ordinary people doing their best in not-so-ordinary situations.

DarkStuff&#39;s Advice:

&gt; Nico put it very nicely. In fact, most of what I wanted to write here he covered. There is another part, though.
&gt; 
&gt; Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions is also meant to be a lens through which we can see the &#34;inbetween&#34; phase, in which people know //of// the anomalous but are clearly ignorant of the //scope// of everything. Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions does not employ reality benders. They don&#39;t manufacture Reality Anchors (though they might use them with Foundation approval). They don&#39;t know much of anything about Anderson, about Are We Cool Yet?, about Fifthism or Sarkicism or Mekhanism (I believe we can call it that). They //have// been seen in Three Portlands in one article, but that&#39;s the outlier. Largely, they have little knowledge of the anomalous world except the small window they can see through the sleepy town of Boring, Oregon, and the Foundation.
&gt; 
&gt; They are //also// meant to be somewhat of a complement to the Foundation. Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions is what the Foundation would be if they were smaller, more idealistic, more //people// focused, more public, more... anything, really. Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions is idealistic and optimistic, where the Foundation is calculating and pessimistic. The way that their energies play off of each other is a large part of the Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions charm. It might be silly, but when writing Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions, think of them as the Spongebob to the Foundation&#39;s Squidward. And sometimes, precisely //because// they are a &#34;Spongebob&#34;, they make very silly mistakes.

&gt; I cannot begin to express how grateful all of us here at the Center are for your donation. It is my pleasure to inform you that your generosity has allowed for the expansion of our Portlands location. We can finally move our modest little office to a bigger area where we can build a kennel and play area to encourage on-site adoptions. Thank you very much!
- [[[para-puppies|&#39;Para-Pedigrees&#39; PED464/CAN33/LUP22]]]

&gt; I thank whoever&#39;s up there every day for my organization, though sometimes I gotta thank someone a bit more down to Earth. If it weren&#39;t for those doctors over by the Foundation, our organization would probably have faded into obscurity. Instead, they decided to let us do our thing, and I think a lot of us appreciate that. I certainly do.

+ Etc.

What, was 31 organizations/people of interest not enough for you people? Goodness, gracious. There are more anomalous groups than the above, but they are a little more obscure. I will include the most notable ones as well as whatever information there is available about them below. Note that information may be little at best and vague at worst, but we labored to make sure we got all that we could right here. GoIs imported from foreign wikis are noted in ##blue|blue.##

[[collapsible show=&#34;Show EVEN MORE Groups of Interest&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]

**🌙🌙🌙 Initiative (Three Moons Initiative):** A group that seeks to protect and shield humanity from all possible threats, from harmful acts on television to dictatorships, via inorganic objects. They originate from a timeline where their world was destroyed, and, after entering the afterlife [http://www.scp-wiki.net/operation-galahad Corbenic] (known for its [[[SCP-2922|three moons]]]), sought to stop other worlds from experiencing the same fate they did. Appears in [[[SCP-2578]]], [[[SCP-3319]]], and [[[SCP-3922]]]. 

**[[span style=&#34;background:black; color:black&#34;]]█████[[/span]] Industrial/Blackbox Industrial:**  The company is a hole in reality, left behind when its higher-ups ascended to a higher plane of existence. Doesn&#39;t have a name, a purpose, or any leadership. Does have resources (sort of) and ambition (sort of). Sometimes, other things move in to fill its numerous cracks. Appears in [[[SCP-4029]]], [[[SCP-2728]]], [[[SCP-2856]]], and [[[URA-1902]]].

**Accelerate the Future (ATF):** A very loosely structured organization which targets niche markets to turn a quick profit. Lead by Ollie Fox, who is a very terrible person. Appear in [[[Mobile Task Furries]]], [[[SCP-3312]]] and [[[SCP-3508]]].

Appears in [[[Holy Science]]], [[[SCP-2782]]], and [[[SCP-3682]]].

**Avelar Professional Products (APP):** A company selling anomalous technologies as office supplies as a means to test their leader&#39;s transhumanist goals. Appear in [[[SCP-4988]]], [[[SCP-3803]]], and [[[The Enemy of my Enemy is my Co-Founder]]].

**Parawatch:** An online group of individuals who are aware that there is something more to reality than meets the eye, but not are not necessarily aware of what the veil is or what it all means.

**Scarlet King:** A mysterious god of immense power, often bringing out and representing blind rage, savageness, and the worst of humankind. As such, this allows for skips to be brutal and get to the heart of what the Foundation does and why they do it.
