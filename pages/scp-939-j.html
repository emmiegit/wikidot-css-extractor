**Item #:** SCP-939-J

**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-939-J is housed in a standard canine containment cell in Site-20. As SCP-939-J has paradoxically demonstrated a simultaneous absolute loyalty to deontological morality and the operations of the Foundation, SCP-939-J is allowed free reign throughout the facility with the accompaniment of Agent Wu.[[footnote]] Previous agents assigned to SCP-939-J include agents Smith, Rosencrantz (Deceased), Thornfield, Rogers, and Guildenstern (Deceased).[[/footnote]]  In the event of any unexplained criminal happenings[[footnote]] Colloquially referred to as &#34;mysteries&#34;. [[/footnote]] SCP-939-J is authorized to take the role of lead investigator. Security personnel are to be briefed on this protocol and on SCP-939-J&#39;s anomalous properties.

**Description:** SCP-939-J is a 50-kilogram German Shepherd. SCP-939-J&#39;s anomalous properties are as follows:

* Ability to speak English.

* Inability to do anything perceived as morally dubious.

* Ability to determine the perpetrator of 93% of criminal acts occurring within a 100-meter radius.

* 93% increase in the number of criminal acts detected within a 100-meter radius.[[footnote]] Thought to be a result of SCP-939-J being able to detect acts that would have otherwise gone unnoticed as opposed to any anomalous increase in crimes. [[/footnote]]

&gt; **Incident:** 20-F-90
&gt; 
&gt; **Crime:** Doctor Edward Jones found dead in Site-20 breakroom.
&gt; 
&gt; **Audio Log:**
&gt; //Agent Smith had recently entered the Site-20 breakroom with SCP-939-J, and was conversing with Dr. Jones over coffee.//
&gt; -----
&gt; **//[BEGIN LOG]//**
&gt; **Agent Smith:** Mind if I sit here?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Jones:** Not at all. I&#39;m in the market for some pals.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Smith:** Well, I&#39;m always looking for more. The name&#39;s James. You?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Jones:** Ed. What&#39;s the dog&#39;s name?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Smith:** He&#39;s actually a skip. 939-J.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-939-J:** Stop fucking calling me that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Jones:** Is he safe to pet?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Smith:** Yeah, he&#39;s a sweet little guy.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-939-J:** C&#39;mere sunshine, you&#39;ll get your petting.
&gt; 
&gt; //Intense growling punctuated with a snapping sound can be heard for the next 10 seconds, followed by the sound of blood splattering.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-939-J:** This man&#39;s been shot. The perpetrator probably used a gun. The jury&#39;s still out on whether or not they also used bullets.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Smith:** Like, holy shit 939-J! They must have shot him so much that his head got torn clean off! 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-939-J:** //(Softly)// Heh, clean.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Smith:** Wait a second, who the hell shot him? EVERYBODY GET DOWN!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-939-J:** Hey everybody, Agent Smith just shot someone! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Smith:** Huh, guess it sometimes just be like that. Sorry.
&gt; 
&gt; -----
&gt; 
&gt; **Post-Incident Report:** //Agent Smith was apprehended and demoted to Class-D for his unprovoked murder of Dr. Jones.//



&gt; **Incident:** 20-F-22
&gt; 
&gt; **Crimes:** Attempted theft of an SCP object, destruction of Foundation property, attempted breach of Foundation security, jaywalking.
&gt; 
&gt; **Audio Log:**
&gt; //Agent Rosencrantz was walking SCP-939-J in the Site-20 recreation yard at the time of the incident.//
&gt; -----
&gt; **//[BEGIN LOG]//**
&gt; **SCP-939-J:** Take me off of this leash or I will discover the resonant frequency of your brain and play it with an instrument constructed from your entrails.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Rosencrantz:** Who&#39;s a good boy? Who&#39;s a good boy?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-939-J:** Ok, fuck it. There&#39;s a crime happening over that wall and it needs your attention.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Rosencrantz:** Crap, I&#39;ll call security.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-939-J:** No, they&#39;ll be too slow. You need to blow a hole in the wall and get out there now.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Rosencrantz:** Sharp as always, 939-J! I know I can count on you!
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Rosencrantz fired multiple rounds into the concrete wall surrounding the Site-20 recreation yard before inserting a grenade, blowing a sizable hole in the wall.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-939-J:** Here, follow me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Rosencrantz:** Across that road? There&#39;s no stop sign or anything there.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-939-J:** You work in a building with hundreds of MacGuffins and you&#39;re concerned about traffic?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Rosencrantz:** Road safety is no joke.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-939-J:** Unlike you.
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-939-J proceeds to run across the road.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Bystander:** Hey! That dog just jaywalked!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-939-J:** Fuck off. It was the idiot behind me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Bystander:** Hey! That idiot just jaywalked!
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Rosencrantz:** Wai- 
&gt; 
&gt; //Multiple gunshots are heard from the Site-20 guard tower, followed by a dull thud.//
&gt; 
&gt; -----
&gt; 
&gt; **Post-Incident Report:** Agent Rosencrantz was shot by the guards overlooking the Site-20 recreation yard for attempting to deliver SCP-939-J to GOI-8305[[footnote]] &#34;Cult of the, uh, Bad Guys who imprison fucking dogs for no reason whatsoever&#34; [[/footnote]] and jaywalking.</textarea></pre>
