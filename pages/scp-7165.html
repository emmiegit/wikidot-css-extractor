**Item #:** SCP-7165
    
**Object Class:** Safe      

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7165 is to be kept in a safe standard containment chamber in the minimum security wing of Site-17. 

**Description:**  SCP-7165 is a superficially non-anomalous gramophone, measuring 25cm wide, roughly 76cm high and 25cm long, with the anomalous ability to change any vinyl it plays into a vinyl of Frank Sinatra, simultaneously changing the cover of said vinyl. However, this vinyl, known as SCP-7165-1, will only be able to play the song &#39;&#39;Come Fly With Me&#39;&#39;, despite the fact that the disk seems to have more songs engraved onto it.

When someone plays a vinyl using SCP-7165, an instrumental version of &#39;&#39;Come Fly With Me&#39;&#39; will be heard, and the exact person who made it play, now SCP-7165-2, will begin to sing along to the song, with proper tune and rhythm.

If someone is within hearing range of SCP-7165-2, they will become known as SCP-7165-3, and will undergo the following effects:
* SCP-7165-3 will start humming //&#39;&#39;Come Fly With Me&#39;&#39;//, following the rhythm of SCP-7165-2.
* SCP-7165-3 may start to dance or clap their hands while humming. These events seem to occur randomly.

There are no side effects from being exposed to SCP-7165, SCP-7165-1,  SCP-7165-2, and SCP-7165-3. After consultation with site director Dr. Charles Gears, SCP-7165 can be removed from its cell and used by staff members for entertainment. On the other hand, each and all uses of SCP-7165 must have been authorized by Dr. Juan Rodriguez two weeks prior to the use of the object.

**Addendum 7165.1:** __Discovery__
SCP-7165 was retrieved on 17/04/99 in an abandoned house near Camdenton, Missouri, by MTF Eta-11. The Foundation sent Eta-11 to investigate the house after a group of young men reported //&#39;&#39;not feeling in control of their own body after hearing somebody unknown to them singing&#39;&#39;// to the local&#39;s authorities. (The identity of this //&#39;&#39;unknown person&#34;// is still being investigated)

Agents Lloyd and Pam noticed a vinyl next to SCP-7165, and Agent Lloyd tried to play it after securing the house. He then started to sing, while Agent Pam started dancing. The rest of Eta-11 didn&#39;t suffer from any effects, as they were unable to hear Agent Lloyd singing, since he was in an isolated room with Agent Pam. After the song was entirely played, both agents stopped singing and dancing and reported the event to the rest of the Mobile Task Force. MTF Eta-11 then safely transported SCP-7165 to Site-17.
