**Item #:**  SCP-███

**Object Class:**  Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:**  The entrance to SCP-███ has been bricked up.  SCP-███ is to be repaired if it becomes so weathered that entry or sight of the interior is possible.  Only Pataphysics Department personnel of Level 3 and above are to know of SCP-███&#39;s existence.

**Description:**  SCP-███ is a large mausoleum located in Site-██&#39;s on-site cemetery.  The building is constructed from severely weathered stone and bears no external distinguishing features.  Its only access point is a rusted iron gate at the center of one wall.  When the object was first discovered, a tarnished brass plaque emblazoned with the words &#34;Department of Abnormalities&#34; was affixed to this gate.

It is not known when SCP-███ was constructed, or by whom.

Beyond the entrance gate, a hallway extends for a long distance before opening into a larger room.  There are numerous small burial chambers along both sides of the hallway, each behind a stone door.  Some of these chambers contain undecorated stone sarcophagi.

Each door is engraved with a name or other moniker that presumably describes the contents of the room behind it or the sarcophagus within.  These labels and the contents of the associated rooms are as follows:

||~ Door Engraving ||~ Contents ||~ Notes ||
|| “The Man of War” || Sarcophagus containing a human skeleton. || The floor of the chamber is littered with shards of severely rusted steel. ||
|| “Hell” || A sinkhole has seemingly opened beneath this chamber. Its horizontal dimensions are approximately those of the burial chamber, but its depth is unknown. || An inscription is visible on the interior wall of the sinkhole several meters down, but it is illegible at that distance and angle. ||
|| [illegible due to damage] || Room is entirely empty. || Area smells faintly of fish. ||
|| “The Devil Machine” || A sarcophagus containing a complex, heavily rusted clockwork device of unknown function. || Rust has rendered all components immobile. ||
|| “Promethean Alloy” || A stack of 120 ingots of an unidentified gray-green metal. || Ingots were heavily tarnished. ||
|| “Lilith” || Sarcophagus containing the remains of an adult human female wearing the standard uniform for humanoid SCP objects.  Bone growths resembling vestigial wings extend from the shoulder blades. || Tongue was removed before death. ||
|| “Jack” || Sarcophagus containing the remains of an adult human male wearing casual clothing.  Individual was castrated before death. || A heart shape surrounding the letter &#34;J&#34; has been carved on the outside of the sarcophagus&#39;s lid. ||
|| “PSR B0531+21”[[footnote]]astronomical designation of the Crab Pulsar; significance unknown[[/footnote]] || unknown || Door cannot be opened. ||
|| &#34;Debra Salazar&#34; || Sarcophagus encased in lead. Has not been opened, due to high radiation levels in its vicinity. || The phrase &#34;OUR NAMES AND MEMORIES SHALL NOT BE OBLITERATED&#34; is carved on the back wall. ||
|| “Epon” || Sarcophagus containing the remains of an adolescent human female.  Length of corpse&#39;s hair nearly exceeded its height.  Nude. || A rosary is clutched in one of the corpse&#39;s hands. ||
|| “Mr. Brass” || Sarcophagus containing a large assortment of mechanical parts, consisting mostly of brass.  Parts appear to be the components of a humanoid automaton. || Reassembly is impossible due to extensive damage and degradation. ||
|| “Things Lost” || Room is empty. || There is a small hole in the rear wall.  It has been plugged with concrete. ||
|| “Job 10:10”[[footnote]]“Hast thou not poured me out as milk and curdled me like cheese?&#34;[[/footnote]] || Empty sarcophagus. || The crypt door and sarcophagus were both open when discovered. ||
|| &#34;Chaos&#34; || The room is completely filled by a complex, nonfunctional machine of uncertain purpose. || The mangled remains of a person in black and red clothing have been forced into the machinery. ||
|| &#34;No More&#34; || An electrical outlet cover is affixed to the rear wall at eye level, slightly off-center. A broken night light shaped like a stylized shooting star is plugged into it. || There is no power to the outlet; there is only a shallow, empty space behind the cover. ||
|| &#34;Nostalgia&#34; || A large pile of broken musical instruments, torn sheet music, and muddy marching band uniforms. || The words &#34;I remember&#34; have been scratched onto the back wall. Two additional lines of text have been damaged beyond legibility. ||
|| &#34;Mr. Soap&#34; || Sarcophagus containing the waterlogged remains of a human male. || The corpse and the interior of the sarcophagus are coated in a thick layer of soap scum. ||
|| “The Full Man” || Sarcophagus containing the remains of an emaciated man with a greatly distended abdomen. || Forensic examination of the abdomen revealed [DATA LOST] ||

The room at the end of the hallway is square, roughly 7 meters on each side.  A large stone tomb stands at the center of the room.  On the top of the tomb, the following has been engraved:

[[=]]
&gt; A memorial for the remembered 
&gt; atop a grave of the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/deletion-range |forgotten]]].

All attempts to access or view the tomb&#39;s interior have failed.</textarea></pre>
