I always hated the gas mask training. For one moment, you’re chilling in an armored truck, and then the next, your instructor comes out of nowhere and says, “GAS, GAS, GAS!” When they say that, they toss tear gas at you, and you have to put on your mask real fast: 6 seconds. I always got anxious, wondering if I put on my mask correctly. It happened to me so many times, and you’d think you’d get used to it. But, no… it doesn’t.

CBRN training was a weird experience. Whenever I had to use the computer while I had my suit on, they would force me to use a pen to type on the keyboard. I was always in my suit, and when I wasn’t, I counted gloves. There was an accident where we were training in full MOPP, and someone damaged their nose, and it started bleeding. So much that it started to fill up in his mask. I overheard him talking to his friends about it. Instead of telling his instructors, he just swallowed all that blood and kept on moving. Didn’t tell nobody about it. I still chuckle and cringe whenever I think of it.

Glad I’m out of training.

----

I was a part of a new unit: “Mu-10” was the name, or “Gas Giants” is what we like to call ourselves. We’re like the Maz-Hatters but much smaller and less cooler. The only reason why we’re even around is that there was an enormous ball of green fog in rural Russia. Geigers showed that it was Chernobyl-level. My guess is the Maz Hatts were too busy with something else, so they couldn’t deploy. So, pretty much, that’s where we came in.

We were a reconnaissance team. Our job was to enter the place, see what was going on, and report back. Easy, right? Hell, no. Besides dealing with heavy equipment, you gotta deal with the heat, which makes it worst when you’re wearing a MOPP level 4 the whole time. But then again, I was trained for this, so I don’t know why I’m whining.

----

We were dispatched to the area. There were four members in our group: Agent Hults: captain, Agent Shrew: lieutenant, Agent Merc: the medic, and then there’s me: a lieutenant, also. They were all… well, I didn’t really get to know them during the flight. We weren’t saying anything to each other. It was awkward, really. Agent Merc was fiddling with his medical bag, I was cleaning my weapons just to kill time, Captain Hults was busy checking our parachutes, and Agent Shrew was looking at his feet, mostly. He would often look at me from time to time. Out of interest, I said: “Dude, you good? Why are you starin’ at me so much?”

“Don’t worry about it,” he replied while making a slight chuckle. “I’m just lookin’ around, that’s all.”

“Shit… alright,” I said and went back to cleaning my rifle.

We finally got to our destination, and we were ready to leap out, but Captain Hults gave us a little speech before we did.

“We’re gonna be in and out, y’all, in and out. If you fuck up somehow, like breaking your legs during the chute landing, then that’s it for you. We’re not saving you.” He said in a joking manner to boost our spirits. “We’re all good, correct?”

“Yes, sir,” we all said.

“Alright, let’s move out, everyone.”

We jumped out of the plane soon after, and it went smoothly; nobody broke their legs, as Hults said. I was the third one to land: the first and second being Hults and Shrew. The last one was, of course, Merc. He was taking his time to get the landing right, taking Captain Hults’ speech to heart. When he landed, we started looking at the mustard green cloud ball. It was huge when I first saw it. You could stack two of the largest stadiums in the world, and you would still see the top of the thing. We started checking if all our belongings were secured, like spare filters, tape, water canteens, etc. It was massive, but we didn’t hesitate to enter it though. It was difficult to see when we went in, and the only visible thing was foggy green and the black on our suits.

“Christ, I can barely see,” Shrew said.

“And?” Hults questioned.

“What do you mean, “and?” I can’t see shit,” he says while adjusting his gas mask.

“Shut your mouth, Shrew, and keep movin’. Ain’t got no time for that right now; we just got here.”

“Yes—” Before Shrew could finish, we heard a series of thunder crashes.

“The hell?” I said.

“Jesus, don’t worry about it,” Hults said, turning back at us. “Never heard thunder before? Just keep moving until we find something.”

It was weird, though. It was perfectly fine outside, but inside it was like hurricane Ida. Finally, the thunder began to calm down, and not long after, we found a village along the way.

 “We gotta stop,” Hults said, slightly raising his hand up.

We stopped in front of a bridge, waiting for orders. Hults was looking around, scoping the area with his binoculars. While we were waiting, I looked at the sign on the bridge and saw the little town’s name.

“What does it say,” Merc asked, walking up to me along with Shrew.

“It says, uh... ‘Old River.’”

“‘Old River,’ huh...? From the looks of it, it should be named ‘Old Rivulet,’” he chuckled.

“The hell is a ‘rivulet,’ Merc,” Shrew said. “What the fuck are you even talkin’ about?”

“Jesus, Shrew, a rivulet’s a small river,” Merc replied angerly.

“You know, I liked you better when you didn’t talk. You know that, right, Mer--?”

“Alright,” Hults sighed. “Everyone get off your asses and c’mere,” he shouted.

He turned to us and pointed to Shrew and me.

“You two,” he said. “Go up to that house over there, and Merc and I will go through the town. Makes sure your radios are on the right frequency.”

He pointed to a tiny building on a small cliff, barely visible with my mask on, but I knew what he was talking about.

“Are you fucking kiddin’ me?” Shrew said. “I’m with her?”

“The hell are you talkin’ about?” Hults said.

“Why am I with her?” Shrew looked at me.

Hults stepped closer to Shrew.

“Because I’m your captain, and you’ll do what you’re goddamn told,” Hults said, clenching his teeth.

“How do I even know if she got my back when things get tense?” Shrew said, “I worked hard to get where I am. She probably had to suck someone off to get to that rank.”

“Jesus,” Merc muttered in disbelief.

I didn’t say anything. I just shook my head and left the circle to go where I suppose to go. I turned back and saw Hults give Shrew a “what the hell are you doing” type shove.

“Shrew, the fuck is your problem, man,” Hults said. “You’re out of line.”

They began to look at me, then looked back at each other and whispered. After a few seconds of them bickering and Merc standing there like a lost child in a Target. Finally, Shrews said, “yes, sir,” in a defeated tone, and walked past me, slightly brushing my arm.

“Don’t worry about that nitwit too much,” Hults said, using his normal voice. “It’s-it’s his time of the month, I’m guessing.” He chuckled awkwardly.

Hmm… funny. “Whatever,” I said and soon walked off into the green mist, leaving a fading silhouette. It took me a while to find where Shrew was. He was sitting on a small boulder when I found him.

“Jesus, there you are,” I said. “Ey, if you got a problem with me, then just say—” I was then interrupted by Shrew.

“No, no, listen,” he said while getting up. “It ain’t about that right now. Since we’re are the same rank, you don’t tell me what to do, and I, vice versa, got it?”

“Whatever, man,” I scoffed. “Let’s just get this done.”

We started our little voyage to the house, and after minutes of walking, we heard radio static.

“How we doin’ over there, over,” Hults said.

Shrew and I looked at each other, seeing who was gonna answer him.

“We’re clear, over,” I replied.

“Good,” he said. “Don’t be afraid to let us know if you need help, now, over.”

“Roger that, out.” I released my finger off the PTT button, attaching my radio back to my hip.

“Can we get goin’ now?”

We kept walking along the dirt path until a sign in Russian greeted us. Conveniently, of course, I knew how to read it. I used to be an intelligence linguist back in the Army in ’97. I remember like it was yesterday... now that I think about it. Jesus, am I that old...?

Ignoring my little crisis, I read the sign. It said: “Church of Old River: ‘Sacrifice the things you love, for the Eye is always watching over us. And the Eye is always giving to those who contribute.’ — Rev. Artyom L. Olegovich.”

“Great,” Shrew said.” “A church.”

“What, you afraid of churches? Do priests make you nervous?”

“Bite me,” He said, then walked off, still following the path. I did, as well.

At the end of the trail was a small, black church. There was no one around except for gravestones beside the main entrance. It was weird.

I’ve been to a few churches when I was little. My parents weren’t really on equal terms back then, so I had to go to different churches every time. Some were calmer, and others were rowdy. The rowdy ones where I go with my dad were always my favorite: people banging on drums, pianists smashing their keys as hard as they could, the preacher screaming his lungs out, ruining the backup singers’ harmony; and it wouldn’t be your average wild church without some guy yelling at the preacher, not because he’s screaming, too, but because of all that energy that’s happening at once make ’em real hype. They just start spewing out random shit you can’t even understand. But I get it, though. You gotta release that energy, somehow. Now that I’m talking about it, I need to go back to those churches one day, just for the energy.

But back to this one. Again, it looked empty, and it was kinda depressing to look at. But we were only outside the place. Who knew what was inside.

“Check out those gravestones,” he said. “Gonna give ’em a look.”

Shrew Walked to one of the graves, examining the person’s name, date of birth, and death. The first one, I noticed he tilted his head like he was confused or something. The second one he chose, he squatted down again, looking at the small memorial.

“What the hell,” he whispered.

Shrew began adjusting his gas mask, rubbing his lenses to give it another look.

“Damn,” he said with a deep sigh.

He then went to the third one, then the fourth, then pretty much all of them except for three. Then, finally, he kneeled and rested his hand on top of the white wooden tombstone.

“They’re— ...They’re all children,” he said with hesitation.

“Dang,” I said. I later walked to one of the graves to see who owned it: Stefan Egorov was his name. He was only 6 years old.

“Let’s not dwell on this, ok,” I said reassuringly. “I’mma check out the inside. When you’re ready, come on.” I got up, leaving Shrew to his own. But to make it a little less awkward for myself, I turned away and got my radio out to see how Merc and Hults were doing.

“Captain, we’ve reached the building. Awaiting your orders, sir, over.”

“Jesus Christ, finally,” he said. “Look for anything that can he—” The sound of static began to grow, making it hard to hear.

“What? Captain, you gotta say that again; I couldn’t hear you, over.”

“I said, look for something important—” The static grew louder, continuing to drown his voice.

“Huh? Captain, you’re losing your signal. I’ll just reach you another time, out.” I unequipped my radio and turned to Shrew, only to find out he was missing.

“Where the hell did that fool get to,” I mumbled. I then looked up at the roof and noticed the little metal rooster slowly spinning in all directions. I didn’t pay it no mind, though. I looked back down to see one of the church’s ebony doors was slightly opened. I entered the place and saw seats filled with people who had already met their maker. Shrew was flicking one of the poor sobs’ heads with his finger, watching it bobble back and forth. It was all fun and games until his finger pierced its rotting skin, leaving it stuck in their head for a split second before immediately pulling it out.

“Ah, Jesus,” he said with shock.

“Leave that thing alone. The hell did they do to you?” I chuckled.

I don&#39;t even know why I bother joking with the idiot. I didn&#39;t like him, but I guess it was just one of those moments. You know, the times when you&#39;re stuck with someone you don&#39;t like and vice versa, but you still kid with them to make it less awkward? To be honest, I only said it to lessen the tension since there were bloated, discolored bodies all around us.

Shrew later walked off, following the dirty, red mat that led you to the altar table. Resting on the table was a cut opened body. I didn’t see any organs in there. Next to the table was a rusty dagger and a huge pot filled with objects wrapped in a bloody cloth. I think I knew what it was, but I didn’t want to find out.

“Ew,” I said, looking at the corpse. “Damn psychos.” Shrew didn’t say anything. He just stared at the lifeless carcass. While looking at the body, I felt water tapping on my head. I looked up and saw water droplets leaking through the roof. I exited the church and was confronted by a wall of rain. I walked down the stairs to look at the rooster again. It was the same as before but spun aggressively faster.

“Well, that’s... that&#39;s great,” I sighed to myself, partially oblivious of how severe the shit storm we were about to get into was gonna be.

I started to wander around the church to find something remotely worth reporting, paying the drizzle no mind. I went to the edge of the cliff to see what else to find, and there was, of course, nothing but dead trees on a lonesome plain. When I looked down to grab my radio, I saw a body on the ground, probably did the “you know what” because they knew how screwed they were. When I turned back, I somehow missed another grave all by itself. Getting a closer look, I saw that they barely buried the kid. It was like they had thrown three scoops of dirt in their face and just called it a day, leaving their arms and legs exposed. The tombstone was missing, only substituting it with a carved board near the corpse. &#34;Ivanov -- a boy deceived by his father, slowly descending upon damnation as his eternal penance.&#34;

Eventually, I was gonna inform Hults that we didn’t find squat until I thought to myself: “How long has it been since I swapped filters?” Really. I couldn’t remember how long I’d been using it since we got there, so I got one out of my bag, took one deep breath, and switched it up. When I was done, I exhaled until I couldn’t anymore, to get out that bad air as much as possible. You can never be too careful. I didn’t want to get stage IV lung cancer or some shit just by breathing that in for a second. I only have one filter left, though. I gotta be real careful with how I should use it.

Seconds later, I heard gunfire in the church, and I rushed to the back entrance to see what was happening. Once I got to the altar, I saw Shrew next to one of the bodies with his gun pointed at it.

“The hell is going on?”

“These m-effers ain’t dead,” he cried out.

One of the bastards was riddled with bullets, but it still kept on moving. We got out of there the second more of them woke up. We were near the edge of the cliff, and my dumbass thought it was a good time to argue.

“The fuck did you do in there, you clown,” I exclaimed, giving him a slight push.

“Don’t push me.” He, in return, pushed, also. “All I did was just check their pockets.”

“Why—? Why the fuck were you runnin’ their pockets for?”

“I don’t know, to find something useful. Maybe even keep something as a souvenir.”

“What,” I said in a dumbfounded tone. “You’re fuckin’ insane.”

“Don’t call me insane, you bi—!” He stops himself from finishing the sentence, only ending it with an assertive “mm” sound while slightly shaking his head.

“The hell is your problem with me, anyway? I ain’t done nothin’ to your dumbass.”

We kept squabbling, and in the rear of my lens, I saw something running towards us. When I noticed, it was too late. The thing ran at Shrew and pushed him off the cliff along with it. I didn’t know what to do for a split second. I just jolted back, still processing what the hell just happened. I was hesitant to look where he dropped, but when I did, he looked... alright… I mean, he was still moving around down there. We weren’t that high up, but there was still a chance that you would break every bone in your body if you landed in the wrong spots.

When I saw that he was ok, I didn’t waste any more time than I did and just ran to him. When I was leaving the church, running down the hill. I got on my radio.

“Captain, you there,” I said, breathing heavily.

“Yeah, what’s happening, over?”

“It’s Shrew, man!”

“What about the jackass, over?”

“He got pushed off the cliff,” I yelled.

“How did he—?” He didn’t finish and just changed the topic. “Where’s he now, over?”

“I-I saw him on the ground still moving, so that’s where I’m going.”

“Well, you find him and see if he’s dead or not,” he retorted. “We’re coming your way.”

“Roger, out.” My adrenaline was pumping so much that I didn’t notice that the rain had become harsher than before: dead twigs flying in my face, scratching my lenses, and the raindrops becoming larger every minute. But that didn’t matter. What mattered was that he was still alive, so he could tell what had happened. I didn’t want to get court-marshaled ’cause they thought I killed him to get back at him. I’m not that stupid or petty when it comes to beef. I don’t want to get my memory wiped and live the rest of my life as an orangie.

They’d probably shave my head, making me look like my childhood Barbie toys. I could get used to that, but the fact that people younger than you will constantly tell you what to do is just embarrassing to me. That thought alone made me even more motivated to save him.

When I finally found him, He was in a fetal position, facing away from me. I said to him: “Shrew, you ok?” But I was only greeted by weak groans, just loud enough to hear. I got closer.

“Shrew,” I said with concern. I pulled him out of that position and faced him toward me. He was covering the bottom half of his mask, so I yanked his arm. The bottom of his filter was chipped. My eyes widen from fear, facing the chance that this fool might not make it. I slapped his mask to get his attention, holding the exposed filter tight with my left hand, thinking it would help.

“Shrew, buddy, you gotta listen to me, ok? Where is your filter bag,” I said with emphasis. “Where is it?” He gradually points to a lonely, roughed up, used to be, air-tight bag next to a corpse. Once I saw it, I quickly patted his shoulder because I was too focused on the bag to actually say thank you.

I ran to it as quickly as I could. When I got to it, I opened it to get one out, and to my surprise, all of them were broken from the fall.

“Motherfucker!” I scoffed, throwing the bag to the ground out of frustration. Finally, I got my last filter and just said fuck it, and ran to him. But before I did, the cadaver grabbed my foot to get a nibble. I jerked my leg, releasing its grip, and I smashed its head in with my boot, covering it with moldy brain tissue. I gotta say it was a perfect stress reliever.

I don’t consider myself a religious person nowadays, but I started to pray that this dude didn’t die when I got there out of desperation. When I did get to him, I removed his filter and swapped it with my last spare, still saying a prayer I could barely recite. When I replaced the filter, he tried to speak to me with all the energy he could muster.

“Wat—”

“What?”

“W-Wat… -er…”

He wanted something to drink, which made sense because breathing in all that, burning your throat, would probably make it dry as hell. So, I got my water canteen and attached the drinking tube to it. He was really thirsty, too. He snatched the canteen out of my hand, leaned his head back, and raised it as far as he could, Emptying the thing in seconds.

“Th-Thank you,” he said with his croaked voice. “Jesus, I needed that that.”

“You’re good, man,” I said. “Just… just relax for a second.”

“Way… way ahead of you.”

“Can you get up?”

“Nah... I-I think I sprained my leg.”

He injured his left leg, and I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t carry him. He was a big dude. There was no way my small-ass was going to carry that man. So I decided to improvise and do that one cool trick I learned from watching that one WW2 movie and made a crutch from his rifle. I got the tape from my bag and grabbed his rifle.

“The hell are you doing,” he said.

“I’m improvising,” I replied, wrapping the gun around his right forearm. “Gonna have put you back on your feet, so you gotta help me out a little.”

“No, no, no, don’t pick me up,” he pleaded.

“Gonna have to, man; we don’t really have a choice here,” I told him. “What if those things try to kill you again. I ain’t gonna let you die like that.”

“Please don’t-- Don’t do it,” he continued to beg, but I didn’t care. I couldn’t let him die if they ever did come. Not because of what I said earlier but because it would forever haunt my conscience if I didn’t. I started counting down, and I could see his eyes through his foggy lenses looking at me. He was scared.

Eventually, I got to zero and pulled as hard as I could, and damn, was he heavy. He, of course, cried out due to the sharp pain. It sounded like it hurt like hell, but he was on his feet again -- well, his foot -- and the rifle crutch was put to good use ’cause he wasn’t having a hard time using it, but I still let him hold on to me to keep his balance, anyway.

“I know that hurt like a bitch, but I didn’t have a choice.”

“I know,” he groaned. “Thank you.”

He didn’t really say anything to me after that. No snarky comments, no nothing. He was finally quiet. I got back on my radio to ask where the hell was they, and they said they were near us. But to make sure, I fired my pistol. Minutes later, I saw two silhouettes coming near us.

“Who’s that,” I shouted, firmly grasping my pistol holster.

“It’s us; chill out,” said Hults. “The hell happen to his leg?”

“I think I sprained it, sir. I’m fine, though.”

“You used his damn rifle?” Merc said to me.

“Yeah. The hell was I supposed to use?”

“How did he even get that? That’s what I’m asking,” Merc said, referring to the injury.

“We were arguing at the edge, and out of nowhere, some type of zombie came at us and tackled him off the cliff,” I said.

“Is that true, Shrew,” Hults asked.

Shrew slightly nodded and pointed to the body with the head that looked like mashed potatoes.

“Well, I’ll be damned! You’re one lucky man, Shrew; I’ll give you that.” He chuckled, shaking his shoulder with his hand. “But we gotta get back to the town.”

“What, y’all found something,” I asked.

“Man, we didn’t find anything,” Merc said. “I’m guessing there was nothing up there either.”

“Yeah, what Merc said,” Hult added. “No, we just need to get back because I called them to pick us up. They’ll be here in a while.”

“Christ, what a waste of time,” I muttered.

We got to the town, settling in one house for about half an hour or so. Hults was on the lookout for more of those monsters since he and Merc also dealt with one of them. I was sitting on a stool, watching Merc treat Shrew’s leg. When Merc asked questions about where the pain was coming from directly, he got his dialysis.

“Yep, he tore a knee ligament, from the looks of it,” Merc said to me. “That crutch you gave him was the right thing to do.”

“Told you,” I said.

‘How bad is it, Merc,” Shrew said. “Am I done for good? Tell me.”

“God, no, it’s just a torn ligament. Since I don’t have an X-ray, if it’s not completely messed up, the healing time would take a quarter of a year,” he said. “Again, I don’t know how bad it is, so don’t take my word for it. It may take longer: 9 months total.”

“Ah, shit,” Shrew muttered. “Well, thanks anyway, Merc. And sorry about what happened earlier. ‘Old Rivulet’ is still a shitty name, but still, my bad,” he chuckled.

“You’re good, but, uh... about your voice… it’ll probably stay like that indefinitely, I’m afraid.”

“Mm...” Shrew said, laying back on the bed, looking at the ceiling

“Just drink some ice tea or something when we get back to base. That’ll make your voice a little less raspy. Hell, my father was a drill sergeant, and it worked fo--”

Before he could give him more advice, Hults got on the radio.

“Merc, get your butt over here, man, over.”

Merc picked up his radio.

“Reason, captain, over?”

“Just come here; I need you to see this, over.”

“Jesus Christ,” he muttered and pressed the button once again. “Yes, sir, captain, I’ll be right there, over.”

“Hurry, out.”

Merc got up from his stool and walked to the door.

“Sorry, y’all, but I gotta go. You heard him, yeah?”

I nodded to him.

“Watch over him, please.”

“Don’t worry, dude, I got him.”

“Cool.” He exits the room, leaving us alone with each other. It was like one of those cringey scenarios you’d see in movies. There was silence until Shrew broke it.

“fuck it, I’ll say it,” he sighed. “I’m sorry, man.”

“What?”

“I’m sorry… for the way I, uh… I acted earlier. What I said at the bridge? I don’t know why I said it; I was just stressed, y’know?”

“Mm-hmm… you’re still an asshole, though.”

“Yeah, I know... I deserve that.”

It went silent again. I could hear the small flame in the lantern crackle from time to time. I didn’t want to say anything, but I owed him an apology, also.

“Yeah… I’m-I’m sorry, too,”

“For what?”

“For the shit that happened at the church. I’m the one that started that whole-ass argument for no damn reason,” I said, adjusting my seat. “If I didn’t start crap, you wouldn’t be all messed up. It was, uh… unprofessional.”

“Nah, man, you’re good. I was the one being unprofessional, acting like… well, like a shrew the whol—”

We heard gunshots outside, and I heard Merc on the radio telling me to get off my ass and help out. I told Shrew to stay put and wait for me when it was clear. I went outside and saw Hults and Merc shooting at more of those things by the bridge. There were so many of them, too, that we had to fall back to the fountain at the center of the town.

When I realized we were screwed, I tried to get Shrew, but he was missing from his bed. Before I could turn around all the way, one of the townsfolk came up to me and tackled me to the ground. It tried to break my facial plate with its rotting teeth. I grabbed it by its neck to push it back, but this one had a lot more energy compared to the others. I kicked it in the chin, but it was still trying.

I was in an awkward situation. I couldn’t grab my gun because I was holding it by the neck, and in the other arm, I was blocking his waving arms, so it wouldn’t pull off my gas mask. During the struggle, its head was blown off. I could hear the bullet whizzing over me, almost puncturing the top of my hazmat suit. I pushed it off me and sat up. It was Shrew.

“Christ, you fuckin&#39; disappeared on me,” I said, sitting up, shoving the corpse off me. “You were supposed to stay here.”

“What, you expected me not to do nothin’? Look on the bright side: we’re even now.”

“That doesn’t matter.” I got up, wiping the blood off my lenses. “We gotta go. I think it safe to say we overstayed our welcome here.”

“Fuckin’ A.”

We left the room together. We saw Hults and Merc fighting off a horde of those things. You’d think it would be easy to kill them off, but no matter how many times you shoot them, they just keep getting back up. I saw one getting trampled by their buddies, and they were still moving, twitching like fresh roadkill.

“Well, this is fun,” Shrew said. “We should do this again sometime.”

“We’re just a temporary replacement, Shrew,” I said. “this is just a one-time thing.”

“That’s what she said,” he quietly chuckled.

We later fell back again until we were at the very edge of the town. It seemed like hope was lost for us until a car came and smashed into the flock out of the mist, leaving a huge gap.

“Get in, goddamn it,” the man hollered, waving at us.

It was a Coalition vehicle. I’ve never been so happy to see the Coalition in my life. You can tell by the logo’s star. They were un-proportional and were uneven because they were too lazy to change it. When we noticed, we didn’t hesitate to get in the back. Shrew was struggling, but Merc and I managed to lift him into the car. Once we were all in, we got the hell out of there. The driver and Hults had fun ramming everything in their path. I could hear them laughing every time I felt the car shake.

“We made it! We actually fucking made it,” Merc said with joy.

“Barely... that was too much for me, y’all,” I said, leaning my head back on the seat, smearing it with old blood.

“You’re a damn hero, man.”

“I didn’t do crap, Merc; chill out,” I said, looking at him.

“No, for real, without you, I don’t think Shrew would be here. Shit, you did more than me, and I’m the medic!”

“Dude, I was just doing my part in the team: helping out my buddies when they need it. No need to make it deeper than it actually is.”

Shrew looked up at me.

“Hey, I, uh, never actually got your name. What is it?”

“It’s Cynthia, Shrew.”

“Mm... well, thank you, Cynthia... for saving my life.”

I didn’t say anything and gave him a slight nod, and went back to resting my head on the seat’s cold rail. I think him hurting his leg both humbled us that day.

“You realize you’re gonna get a medal for this, right,” Merc added.

And he was right, you know? But I didn’t want the thing. I was just being a good person. But they gave it to me, anyway, and I get it. It’s like receiving the Medal of Honor: no matter how many times you say no to it, you’re taking the damn medal whether you like it or not. So there is no “no” when given an award like that.

We later left the Godforsaken town, and we choppered out of the area for good. I was peeping out the window, and in the clouds, I saw a huge eye looking right at us. I watched as it slowly closed itself and just vanished. I could’ve said something about it, but I was too tired to care. Was I hallucinating? Maybe. But I guess it didn’t matter. The Occult can handle this one.

But it is kinda concerning that the thing is probably the cause of all this: covering everything in toxic gas, reanimating corpses, et cetera. Makes me wonder what would happen if it was all over the world doing that crap.

But if it does ever come to that... we’ll be ready.</textarea></pre>
