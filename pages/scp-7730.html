**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation members are to avoid direct verbal communication with known patients of SCP-7730 whenever possible. Embedded agents within civilian hospitals are to be tasked with identifying patients of SCP-7730. All such patients are to be diagnosed with a non-anomalous autoimmune disease, and kept on observation. As the spread of SCP-7730 among the civilian population is difficult to track, full containment of SCP-7730 is impossible. However, as the rate of infection is low, simulations show SCP-7730 is not expected to spread beyond [[span style=&#34;background-color: black&#34;]]⸺⸺⸺-[[/span]] total infectees.

**Description:** SCP-7730 is a contagious autoimmune disease spread via an anomalous memetic vector. It is estimated that there are currently approximately 350,000 active infection cases of SCP-7730, the majority of them being civilian. Immune systems affected by SCP-7730 will start attacking various different tissues of the host, with a preference towards specific types of tissue differing from patient to patient. The symptoms of SCP-7730 occur in three major stages:
* **Stage 1:** Patient is initially infected by SCP-7730, and the patient&#39;s immune system is modified to start slowly attacking specific tissues of the host body. At this stage, the symptoms of SCP-7730 may resemble that of various autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes or certain types of arthritis.
* **Stage 2:** After 1 to 3 years on average, the rate at which the patient&#39;s tissues deteriorate drastically increases, and the immune system begins to target a wider variety of tissues. Along with this, the patient&#39;s tissues also begin regenerating at a much faster rate, keeping the patient alive in a state of elevated pain. This stage lasts for 3 to 7 years.
* **Stage 3:** The rate at which the patient&#39;s tissues regenerate starts to slow down, causing the immune system to slowly destroy the patient&#39;s body, resulting in death.
There is no known case of a patient of SCP-7730 surviving longer than 11 years after the point of infection.

SCP-7730 spreads by mildly altering the voice of the patient to contain auditory memetic information that acts as a vector. The specific ways in which this alteration happens is currently unknown, and altered voices are indistinguishable from baseline vocal variations across the population. When a human is exposed to a sufficiently large amount of this altered voice,[[footnote]]Notably, voices transmitted or recorded electronically do not contain the necessary memetic information to infect other hosts, as the slight information loss in the encoding process renders the memetic vectors inert.[[/footnote]] their nervous system will reconfigure itself to contain the memetic component of SCP-7730, causing them to be infected.

Despite extensive research, there is no known cure for SCP-7730.

+++++ NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION
-----
Ignore the warning above. If you can see this document, I assume you&#39;ve already been fully briefed about what happened to the SCP-7730 situation. The document you are about to read below is the truth about what SCP-7730 is, or rather, could have been.

Hundreds of thousands suffer and die from SCP-7730 every day, thinking it&#39;s some other, less lethal and non-contagious disease. We could have cured them, we //could// cure them, but sometimes, these difficult decisions have to be made for the greater good.

Remember, we secure, we contain, and we protect.

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation members are to avoid direct verbal communication with known patients of SCP-7730 whenever possible. Foundation agents within civilian hospitals are to be tasked with identifying patients of SCP-7730. All such patients are to be relocated to Foundation-owned medical facilities, and treated with Procedure MT-7730-06.

At least one and no more than three D-class personnel are to be kept infected with SCP-7730 at any time for research purposes. Extensive care is to be taken to avoid SCP-7730 being spread to any research personnel involved.

As the infection rate of SCP-7730 is low, with the current containment procedures, it is estimated that SCP-7730 will be completely eradicated from the civilian population by July 2014.

**Description:** SCP-7730 is a contagious autoimmune disease spread via an anomalous memetic vector. There are currently 5,837 documented currently active infection cases of SCP-7730, the majority of them being civilian. Immune systems affected by SCP-7730 will start attacking various different tissues of the host, with a preference towards specific types of tissue differing from patient to patient. The symptoms of SCP-7730 occur in three major stages:
* **Stage 1:** Patient is initially infected by SCP-7730, and the patient&#39;s immune system is modified to start slowly attacking specific tissues of the host body. At this stage, the symptoms of SCP-7730 may resemble that of various autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes or certain types of arthritis.
* **Stage 2:** After 1 to 3 years on average, the rate at which the patient&#39;s tissues deteriorate drastically increases, and the immune system begins to target a wider variety of tissues. Along with this, the patient&#39;s tissues also begin regenerating at a much faster rate, keeping the patient alive in a state of elevated pain. This stage lasts for 3 to 7 years.
* **Stage 3:** The rate at which the patient&#39;s tissues regenerate starts to slow down, causing the immune system to slowly destroy the patient&#39;s body, resulting in death.
There is no known case of a patient of SCP-7730 that has not undergone Procedure MT-7730-06 surviving longer than 9 years after the point of infection.

SCP-7730 spreads by mildly altering the voice of the patient to contain auditory memetic information that acts as a vector. The specific ways in which this alteration happens is currently unknown, and altered voices are indistinguishable from baseline vocal variations across the population. When a human is exposed to a sufficiently large amount of this altered voice,[[footnote]]Notably, voices transmitted or recorded electronically do not contain the necessary memetic information to infect other hosts, as the slight information loss in the encoding process renders the memetic vectors inert.[[/footnote]] their nervous system will reconfigure itself to contain the memetic component of SCP-7730, causing them to be infected.

After extensive research, a method to cure SCP-7730 has been developed, known as Procedure MT-7730-06. The procedure involves scanning the patient&#39;s neural activity, in order to generate packets of personalized memetic &#39;anti-information&#39; that are delivered to the patient in parts over time, slowly counteracting the effects of SCP-7730. Despite being costly and labor-intensive, this method has been proven necessary in order to remove SCP-7730 entirely from the civilian population.

**Update 2005/10/09:** Due to the recent acquisition of multiple high-risk SCP objects, the funding on SCP-7730 research and treatment has been reduced. Foundation medical facilities MS009, MS032, and MS040 are no longer capable of treating patients with Procedure MT-7730-06.

Civilian patients sent to the aforementioned medical facilities are now to be put on quarantine indefinitely, and treated with non-anomalous medical procedures. When the symptoms reach the second or third stage, the patients are to be treated with painkillers.

**Update 2006/03/03:** Due to the large-scale reallocation of Foundation budget following the commencement of Project 009428-682, funding on SCP-7730 research and treatment has been halted indefinitely due to it being a low priority task. New containment procedures are being drafted accordingly.

**Update 2006/04/14:** Due to increasing reports of low morale, especially among recently reassigned research personnel, the Ethics Committee has determined that it is necessary to classify certain information relating to several low-priority SCPs that are not being actively researched in order to help personnel focus on more important tasks at hand.

Following Ethics Committee Ruling 060412-037, all Foundation personnel previously assigned to SCP-7730 research and treatment have been amnesticized, and all information regarding Procedure MT-7730-06 has been classified above Level 4 clearance.
