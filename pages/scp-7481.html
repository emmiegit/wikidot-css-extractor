    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>+ **SCP-7481 - Northeast B Minor**

**Classification:** Keter

------

**Description:** 
A mass estimated at 6,114 km in circumference upon initial sighting.

**Discovery:** 
SCP-7481 was spotted by the United States National Space Surveillance Control Center (NSSCC) on November 19th, 2009, by the Cape Cod Air Force Station in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. 

SCP-7481 was spotted entering the solar system, believed at first to be a massive asteroid. SCP-7481‘s trajectory was initially presumed to leave the solar system after 48 hours. On November 20th, SCP-7481 was spotted again by the Cape Cod Air Force Station heading close to the orbit of Pluto, defying initial trajectory paths proposed for the assumed asteroid. SCP Foundation agents quickly entered as additional expert contractors under the alias of NSSCC Surveillance Technicians and one agent as Surveillant Director. 

On November 21st, SCP-7481 collided with Pluto’s moon, Charon, and rapidly expanded to an estimated size of 9,056 km over the course of 43 hours. NSSCC declaimed emergency on November 21st, 2009, at 5:33pm, now spotting extraterrestrial threat. 

Agencies across the world were notified in an attempt to mobilize as deterrents against SCP-7481, however on November 23rd, 2009, SCP-7481 began traveling outside of Pluto’s orbit and aimed outside the solar system. Charon had been reduced in size by 80% as a result of collision with SCP-7481. Pluto’s solar orbit had changed drastically and is presumed to be flung out of our solar system within the next 300 years as a result of the damage to its moon.

After November 27th, all surveillance of SCP-7481 was lost. On November 30th, a noise, which somehow traveled through space, reached Earth and sounded across most of eastern North America. Radar Frequency Systems (RFS) across the world reported inability to properly receive. Aircraft, coastal, and recreational use of radio frequency stunted and the world population suffered with loss or complication of balance and direction for 342 hours, ending on December 14th. The incident of November 30th was nationally referred to as the Northeast B Minor due to its incredibly low octave note. An approximated 150,000 casualties resulted from this noise.

On January 12th, 2010, images of SCP-7481 finally returned to Earth, identifying it’s body to be comprised of organic flesh, defying all rationale of structure and laws of physics. SCP-7481 held uncountable numbers of orifices, which generally might be associated as mouths by human beings. 

Since its last sighting on November 27th, 2009, SCP-7481 has never been spotted again.

**Speculation:**
It is widely believed that SCP-7481 launched material or frequency quick enough to reach earth. The material or frequency, though not visible by any means of detection used at the time, must have traveled at a minimum speed of 71,946,616 kilometers an hour in order to reach Earth. Upon contact with Earth, two possible options for speculation surfaced: 

1) If SCP-7481 launched an emission from which sound could vibrate through space (suggesting a physical combination of material), the emission did reach Earth and acted as a conduit for the noise to travel through space and strike the Northeast of America. 
2) If SCP-7481 created a frequency, the frequency did reach Earth and caused the atmosphere of the Northeast of America to vibrate and create the Northeast B Minor. 

Both speculations involve direct contact with an emission somehow generated or expelled from SCP-7481 and most of North America could have had contact with it. Long term effects of contact with the emission have been too varied to rule upon with any statistical metric. No known material has been identified and no observable frequency beyond the sound of Northeast B Minor had been captured.

**Name:**
SCP-7481 would later be named the Northeast B Minor for lack of a better term and the proliferation of the title.</textarea></pre>
