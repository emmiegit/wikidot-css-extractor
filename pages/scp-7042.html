**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7042 is kept in a secure storage locker in the archives of Site 84. Testing and Instances created by SCP-7042 are to be held within the on-site Wilderness Observation Chamber with created instances being monitored for a period of 30 days. The Chambers are to be kept under observation by 2 security personnel armed with tranquilizers. After that period, nonthreatening anomalous instances are to be transferred to GOI-466 (Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions), while nonanomalous entities are to be donated to local zoos alongside additional funding[[footnote]] However, transfers are currently suspended, following Incident 7042-3, information about this event is limited to staff with Level 4 Security Clearance.[[/footnote]]. 

**Description:** SCP-7042 consists of two constituent parts. SCP-7042-1 is a worn sketchbook with a heavily scarred leather-bound cover. SCP-7042-2 is a pencil, the body resembling birch bark in texture and pattern, which never grows dull no matter how often it is used. When SCP-7000-1 is opened to the first page, it displays a worn sketch of a fist within a heart wreathed in vines. All other pages will be blank outside of the faintest erasure marks. 

If a name of an animal, whether it be the common parlance or scientific denomination, is entered into SCP-7042-1 using SCP-7042-2, the pencil will animate. Sliding from the hand of the subject, it will begin to sketch a drawing of the aforementioned animal. Within 30-seconds of the sketch being finished, a living version of that animal will appear within twenty feet of SCP-7042. The number of animals produced from one sketch is randomized, though numbers have yet to exceed six individual instances. Notably, these animals might directly correlate to the name entered, or it could differ in various ways as discovered in Testing. Genetic ancestors, cousins, and descendants have been produced by SCP-7042, as well as baseline species created with anomalous abilities. This is further expounded upon in the Testing Logs.

SCP-7042 was recovered by MTF Beta-4 &#34;Castaways&#34; after an attempted raid on Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions by Serpent&#39;s Hand forces. Beta-4 tracked the fleeing cell members back to their hideout and immediately came under fire. Complicating matters was the intervention of SCP-7042-A1, which injured seven members of Beta-4 before being put down with high-grade tranquilizers.

Upon entering the compound&#39;s interior, Beta-4 discovered documents detailing the creation of &#34;Gaia&#39;s Fortune,&#34; a mixture of Serpent&#39;s Hand members and former GoI-466 personnel. The cell’s leader willingly submitted himself into Foundation custody after Beta-4 found him in the middle of writing within SCP-7042.

**Interviewed:** PoI-8842

**Interviewer:** Agent Marks

**Foreword:** Initial interview with POI-8842 regarding their actions and SCP-7042.

**&lt;Begin Log, 11:42, 5/1/202█&gt;**

**Agent Marks:** State your name for the record.

**PoI-8842:** Come on, Marks, you know me.

**Agent Marks:** Name. 

**PoI-8842:** Finn Mallory. You didn&#39;t kill her, did you?
 
**Agent Marks:** Who?

**PoI-8842:** Portia. Told the idiots not to start shooting, that&#39;d spook her, but I&#39;m just some hick from a magic zoo; who&#39;d listen to me when Big Brother comes knocking, right?

**Agent Marks:** You mean the elephant? The pink elephant.

**PoI-8842:** Yes, did you kill her?

**Agent Marks:** No, she&#39;s on her way to Wilson&#39;s as we speak.

**PoI-8842:** Not gonna be another Thunderhorn  [[footnote]][[[SCP-654|SCP-654]]] [[/footnote]], is it?

**Agent Marks:** Things have chan-

**PoI-8842:** Spare me. Ask me what you want to know so I can get to my involuntary vacation.

**Agent Marks:** Why did you attack Wilson&#39;s?

//PoI-8842 smiles but says nothing//

**Agent Marks:** Well?

**PoI-8842:** We needed something from the database; luck of the draw, I still had my credentials, so they decided it was our best option.

**Agent Marks:** What were you after?

**PoI-8842:** Information.

**Agent Marks:** Helpful.

**PoI-8842:** Ain&#39;t I just.

**Agent Marks:** I&#39;ll repeat myself; what were you after?

**PoI-8842:** Names, species names, for the anomalies at the Park. The Snakes thought it would help use it better.

**Agent Marks:** It?

//PoI-8842 reaches up with manacled hands and taps SCP-7042 with a finger//

**PoI-8842:** This.

**Agent Marks:** Go on.

**PoI-8842:** Well, this little sketchbook is something right special. Might be the luckiest break I have ever gotten my hands on, but I digress. Long and short of it, this little beauty is Portia&#39;s Mama. 

**Agent Marks:** It makes anomalies?

**PoI-8842:** Yep, but that&#39;s not all; the entire animal kingdom, past, present, and future right at your fingertips. All you need is a little luck, and it can make you something gorgeous.

**Agent Marks:** And if you don&#39;t?

**PoI-8842:** Heh, that would be telling. 

**&lt;End Log, 12:20&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** PoI-8842 refused further questioning and has been remanded to Foundation Custody. Experimentation with SCP-7000 is to commence at Site 84.

SCP 7042-2 rises and begins to sketch. After a minute of drawing, the pencil returns to its inactive state. 30 seconds after that, a male //Canis lupus familiaris// appears. The D-Class is elated, claiming that it looks just like his old dog. He is removed from the testing area. After 30 days of observation, the Golden Retriever was confirmed to be nonanomalous and was adopted by Site Staff.

SCP-7042 acts in the same manner as the previous test. However, it produces 6 specimens of the //Aptenodytes forsteri//, with an anomalous size of 4.27 meters in height. Following the 30-day observation period, the specimens were transferred into the care of GoI-466.

D-4202 writes the word &#34;Horse&#34; within SCP-7042-1. The pencil floats into the air, shaking back and forth in the D-Classes face for a period of ten seconds before beginning to sketch. 30 seconds after completion of the drawing, a female //Equus caballus// appears. After starting at the D-Class for approximately one minute. The instance mock-charges them, revealing sharp canid teeth. Classified SCP-7042-A4, the instance is held for a period of 30 days before being transferred into the care of GoI-466.

&#34;The ability for SCP-7042 to create viable members of species on the brink of extinction has caused a stir here at 84. Professional detachment are the words of the day for the Foundation. Still, it&#39;s hard to wrangle some of the world&#39;s best zoologists, conservationists, and veterinarians away from seeing this as a boon. Already I have heard talk of SCP-7042 being called a &#34;godsend&#34; or &#34;lucky charm.&#34; I have reprimanded such talk accordingly&#34;-Dr. Erende.

I have noticed an evident change in the personnel at Site 84. Not a conversation goes by without SCP-7042 coming up at least once. I am uncertain if this is an underlying cognitohazerdous effect that the object exudes or just my colleagues&#39; excitement over the possibilities that could come with further testing. News reached us recently from GoI-466 that both female Northern White Rhinos SCP-7042 created are pregnant with twins. 

Many of my fellow researchers were conservationists in a former life, and I can not lie that even amongst the Foundation, bitterness over the current trajectory of the world is widely felt, at least here at Site 84. Even I must admit that the reality that the object has possibly quadrupled the number of extant specimens is a stroke of good fortune. However, I care very little for &#39;luck.&#39; I wish to know if we could control precisely what SCP-7042 produces. As of yet, it has all been random, from number to ability. It can reach back and forward in time and bring specimens to our doorstep; the opportunities there also go without saying. 

The object is clearly intelligent, with keen situational awareness, and if I can rely upon the reports of my colleagues and subordinates, a personality echoing that of a young child. Perhaps this period of dormancy is little more than a momentary rebellion or a tantrum. I have been told that PoI-8842 wishes to speak with me regarding the object. I suppose it is time I finally pay him a visit. 

I refuse to commit to the giddy spirit that has overcome Site 84. SCP-7042 is not a harbinger of good fortune. It is just one more anomaly to add to the ever-growing pile, but this is not some Deathbringer or world-ender. It is simply an opportunity.

**Interviewed:** PoI-8842

**Interviewer:** Dr. Armando Erende

**Foreword:** The first conversation between Dr. Erende and POI-8842 about SCP-7042&#39;s traits.

**&lt;Begin Log, 6:24, 8/13/2█&gt;**

**Dr. Erende:** Good morning, PoI-8842.

**PoI-8842:** To you, maybe, but since I haven&#39;t seen actual sunshine in over a year, or heard my real name, or had a proper cup of coffee, you can excuse my foul mood.

//Dr. Erende merely nods his head//

**PoI-8842:** So, what can I do for you, Doc?

**Dr. Erende:** I would like to ask you questions regarding SCP-7042.

**PoI-8842:** I bet you would.

**Dr. Erende:** The Foundation has been able to gather that the object was under your care for some time. Sightings of rare species would usually precipitate following your departure from an area.

//PoI-8842 raises his eyebrows but says nothing//

**Dr. Erende:** Busselton, Bodmin Moor, Tinganavudu, Ouarzazate, the list goes on and on. For the past ten years, every city or village you&#39;ve stopped in has seen an uptick in &#34;Cryptid&#34; sightings. 

**PoI-8842:** And?

**Dr. Erende:** And I would like to know how you managed to control SCP-7000. How did you get it to provide proper specimens for the locales you traveled to?

//PoI-8842 is silent for several moments before breaking out in a fit of laughter//

**Dr. Erende:** Might I ask where the joke was?

**PoI-8842:** Sitting right in front of me. See, that&#39;s the problem with you Foundation types. You think that with enough poking and prodding, eventually, everything will fall perfectly in line with how you view the world. I heard you folks were turning over new leaves or something, letting bygones be bygones, not meddling where you aren&#39;t needed, but it&#39;s too tempting, right?

**Dr. Erende:** What is?

**PoI-8842:** The sketchbook. You know what she can do now, don&#39;t you? All those possibilities floating through your brain.

**Dr. Erende:** She?

**PoI-8842:** She, he, it, whatever, there&#39;s a mind that little book. A mischievous, optimistic spirit that just wants to create. To bring life, and what is better, it likes fixing mistakes. Our mistakes. The day...that book was the luckiest thing that ever happened to me. 

**Dr. Erende:** Many of my colleagues feel the same way. 

**PoI-8842:** But you don&#39;t?

**Dr. Erende:** I will not lie and say that I do not see the opportunities SCP-7042 could provide, but that is all I see. Opportunity.

**PoI-8842:** Some would say that&#39;s just another way to say &#39;good luck.&#39; But come on, tell me why you actually wanted to come to talk to me. Cause if it was to &#34;control&#34; what the sketchbook makes, I got bad news. The final product, whatever it might be, it&#39;s always up to her.

**Dr. Erende:** What if it stops writing?

**PoI-8842:** That means you&#39;ve gone and made her upset. She&#39;ll come around, but I&#39;d be cautious. Mischievous is just one step from devious. It might take a while for things to smooth over, but if you want Doc, maybe I can be of some actual help. I can talk to her, convince her you messed up, that she&#39;ll be running the show the way she wants to from now on. 

 **Dr. Erende:** No.

//Dr. Erende stands up, heading for the door.//

**PoI-8842:** Feh, don&#39;t come crying to me when you realize that trying to dictate Nature never goes the way Humans want it to. Though, I feel you should be well aware of not repeating that mistake, eh?

//Dr. Erende stops, turning around.//

 **Dr. Erende:** Me?

//Two guards move past him, grasping PoI-8842 on both arms//

**PoI-8842:** Give me a sec, Gents. Not claiming to know about your personal failings, Doc. Just those of the Foundation. Turn every leaf you like. You&#39;ll never be able to undo some of the things you people have done. Entire peoples, entire species, wiped out due to your actions, your inaction!

//PoI-8842 surges against his bonds, lunging for Dr. Erende//

**PoI-8842:** I remember what you took away! But you can make it right! You have the key. You just need to take the chance. She is good luck. She is. She has to be. She never did wrong by me, long as I did right be her! Just treat her right, you hear me?! You treat her right! She is us, and we are her!

//PoI-8842 begins ferally snarling for several moments after this before being forcibly sedated//

**&lt;End Log, 6:40&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** Under Dr. Erende&#39;s orders, PoI-8842&#39;s cell was searched, and several pieces of paper covered in rambling writing were discovered and are documented below.

Following his outburst, further examination of PoI-8842 revealed withdrawal symptoms in line with those found in gambling addiction. Regular Screenings for signs of cognitohazardous influences began on-site on the orders of the Site Director. Notably, all D-Class personnel and Researchers that had used SCP-7042 showed no signs of being affected by a cognitohazard. SCP-7042 remained dormant for another month before the movement was captured on the Archive&#39;s security cameras. 

Below is the Transcription of the Impromptu &#34;Interview&#34; between Dr. Erende and SCP-7042.

**DATE:** 9/14/2█ 

**NOTE:** Video is taken from security footage following SCP-7042&#39;s reactivation. This is the first instance of SCP-7042 conversing with a member of Staff.

[BEGIN LOG-8:42 am]

//SCP-7000-1 unfurls of its own accord. SCP-7042-2 rises within SCP-7042&#39;s containment unit and begins writing. The camera zooms in, catching the word &#34;Hello?&#34; sketched in sizable lettering. SCP-7042-2 stays suspended in the air, rotating slowly.//   

//Security staff contacts Dr. Erende and affiliated staff studying SCP-7042.//

//Dr. Erende enters the Archives with 2 security personnel in tow. After a moment of silently observing the SCP, Dr. Erende speaks.//

**Dr. Erende:** Open the container. 

//Security personnel open the storage locker and carefully pull SCP-7042 free, placing it on a nearby table.// 

**Dr. Erende:** Thank you. 

//Security personnel take positions on either side of the table as Dr. Erende turns and nods behind him. Dr. Waller enters the room, carrying a clipboard. The pair move to the table, looking down at SCP-7000.// 

**Dr. Erende:** Hello?

//SCP-7042-1&#39;s pages flutter as SCP-7042-2 bolts downwards and begins writing.//

**SCP-7042:** HI!
 
**Dr. Erende:** We were not aware that you were capable of communicating. 

**SCP-7042:** SECRET. FINN. WARNED.

**Dr. Erende:** Warned of what?

**SCP-7042:** JAILERS. YOU?

**Dr. Erende:** No, we are the Foundation. You are safe here. 

**SCP-7042:** SAFE? 

**Dr. Erende:** Yes.

//SCP-7042 stops writing for several minutes, SCP-7042-2 tapping on the pages.//

**SCP-7042:** DONT BELIEVE. FINN? WHERE?

**Dr. Erende:** He is being kept safe as well. He can&#39;t be here, I am sorry.

**SCP-7042:** SORRY? SHOULD BE. SORRY.

//SCP-7042 makes several aggressive scribbles across its pages.//

**SCP-7042:** TRIED. MAKE. HURT. FRIEND.

//Accompanying the last word, SCP-7042 sketches an octopus. SCP-7042-2 jabs at it several times as if emphasizing. Dr. Erende and Waller look around the room in expectation of a manifestation, but after several minutes nothing appears. Dr. Waller makes a note.//

**SCP-7042:** SORRY?

//Dr. Erende is silent, prompting Dr. Waller to speak.//

**Dr. Waller:** We just wanted to see what you can do.

**SCP-7042:** DO? I CAN DO LOTS!

**Dr. Waller:** We&#39;ve seen. 

**SCP-7042:** YEAH? THEY SAFE? ANIMALS?

**Dr. Waller:** Quite safe, you&#39;ve proven to be quite the little good luck charm.

//Dr. Erende shoots her a dark look. She ignores him, stepping closer to SCP-7042.// 

**SCP-7042:** GOOD LUCK?

**Dr. Waller:** Yes, some of your creations are going to be parents.

**Dr. Erende:** Dr. Waller, that is enou-

//He is cut off by the explosive movement of SCP-7042&#39;s pages as the pencil writes on repeat for thirty seconds.//

**SCP-7042:** BABIES?! BABIES?!

**Dr. Waller:** Yes. That was a very good thing you did. They are very lucky.

**SCP-7042:** GOOD FIX. LUCKY DAY.

//Dr. Erende places a hand on Dr. Waller&#39;s shoulders and draws her back from SCP-7042, superimposing himself.//

**Dr. Erende:** There can be more &#34;fixes&#34; if you agree to work with us; no more danger will come to your creations as long as you do as we ask. Exactly what we ask.

**SCP-7042:** WHY? 

**Dr. Erende:** You&#39;re only other opportunity is staying confined here.

//SCP-7042 calms down, falling silent for 2 minutes. Dr. Waller frowns at Dr. Erende and goes to speak, but he halts her with a raised hand.//

**SCP-7042:** BORING. OKAY.

**Dr. Erende:** Then let&#39;s get back to work.

**SCP-7042:** LUCKY DAY.

In the following weeks, the Site Director signed off on the continued testing of SCP-7042 with the requirement that cognitohazard screenings occur after every session. These tests were performed solely by Dr. Erende in an attempt to forge a bond with SCP-7042 that would turn it towards the Foundation&#39;s aims. This testing series led to a number of instances being created that hemmed closely to what was asked for by Dr. Erende. However, they often showed heightened aggression and abnormal defense mechanisms for their species until eventually leading to Incident 7042-2.

**Incident 7042-2**

Test 7042-A26 lead to the creation of four instances of //Phascolarctos cinereus//. Preliminary testing led Site Personnel to believe that the instances were nonanamolous. However, when a member of the staff entered SCP-7042-A26&#39;s enclosure, after a week of observation, they were ambushed by said instances. Falling from the tree, the instances were shown to have grown a foot taller, had increased claw length, and oversized canines. Security Staff intervened, but the staff member was maimed, losing their right arm in the process, and two of the instances had to be put down with lethal force after refusing to release the staff member. Dr. Erende was notified of the event, and the conversation between the Doctor and SCP-7042 is captured below.  

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Interviewed:** SCP-7042

**Interviewer:** Dr. Erende.

**Foreword:** Dr. Erende confronts SCP-7042 about their duplicity, leading to a conversation that notes a noticeable change in Dr. Erende&#39;s behavior.

**&lt;Begin Log, 12:42&gt;**

**Dr. Erende:** Why?

**SCP-7042:** WHAT?

**Dr. Erende:** Why did you do that?

**SCP-7042:** WHAT? CONFUSED.

**Dr. Erende:** The Koalas.

**SCP-7042:** HA. HA. HA!

**Dr. Erende:** You think this is funny?

**SCP-7042:** FINN. TOLD. FAIR PLAY.

**Dr. Erende:** Fairplay for what?

**SCP-7042:** TRY. HURT FRIEND! NO SORRY!

//SCP-7042-2 wags back in forth aggressively//

**Dr. Erende:** The Octopus was not harmed. It&#39;s still here on the Site, being taken care of by staff. You made sure it would be fine. How is this fair play?

**SCP-7042:** YEP. GOOD SCARE! RIGHT?

//Dr. Erende blinks in surprise//

**Dr. Erende:** What...do you think happened SCP-7042?

//SCP-7042-1&#39;s pages flutter as if SCP-7042 notices the shift in tone.//

**SCP-7042:** KOALA. ANGRY. SCARE, RIGHT? ???

**Dr. Erende:** No.

//The pages begin to move even more frantically.//

**SCP-7042:** WHAT. HAPPENED? WHAT HAPPENED?! HAPPENED?!?

**Dr. Erende:** One of my colleagues was injured. Very badly. Two of the instances...had to be put down.

**SCP-7042:** NO! LIE! TRICK! NO!

**Dr. Erende:** I could have staff bring the bodies here.

//SCP-7042-1 snaps close, the sound of a child sobbing is faintly heard on the recording, and Dr. Erende flinches as if struck. SCP-7042-2 taps listlessly at the glass, and sobbing continues for a period of ten minutes. SCP-7042-1 unfurls.//

**SCP-7042:** SORRY! SORRY! SORRY! NOT KNOW. 

**Dr. Erende:** You were trying to scare us. All the instances since the Octopus were an attempt to get back at...at me?

**SCP-7042:** YES! NO HURT. NEVER HURT. MISTAKE!

**Dr. Erende:** You want us to believe that you would never hurt anyone? That was just the tip of the iceberg.

**SCP-7042:** YES! LOVE ANIMALS. SAVE ANIMALS. CREATE TO SAVE. HUMANS ANIMALS. NEVER HURT. MISTAKE. PLEASE. LET FIX!

**Dr. Erende:** Fix this how, SCP-7042?

**SCP-7042:** MAKE. AS SAY. NO PLAY. JUST MAKE. FIX MISTAKES. TOGETHER. I, US. I SORRY!

//Dr. Erende seems to flinch again as the crying returns.//

**Dr. Erende:** You can be sorry, but that doesn&#39;t change what happened, and we can not trust what you say. You&#39;ve already proven to be willingly devious. 

**SCP-7042:** I. BE BETTER. PLEASE. NOT DONE. CHANCE. GIVE CHANCE!

**Dr. Erende:** You already played that card, and regardless that is out of my hands.

**SCP-7042:** NO! I GIVE CHANCE! PROVIDENCE.

**Dr. Erende:** You&#39;re bargaining. 

**SCP-7042:** NO. HONEST. PLEASE. LUCKY DAY. REMEMBER?

**Dr. Erende:** You are not a good luck charm! You aren&#39;t some bastion of hope! You&#39;re just some trickster with the mentality of a child!

**SCP-7042:** I AM. I AM. I AM. HELP FIX ME. PROMISE. TO LISTEN.

**Dr. Erende:** I...I&#39;m sorry. Why am I sorry?

//Dr. Erende shakes his head and backs away from SCP-7042 before exiting the room, the security staff following.//

**SCP-7042:** DONT GO. DONT GO! SORRY! PLEASE. I NEED. MORE TO DO. FOR HIM. FOR HER. FOR YOU. FOR YOU! FOR US!

**&lt;End Log, 13:26&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** Dr. Erende immediately submitted himself for a cognitohazard screening following the conversation.  Site-84&#39;s Director suspended all testing with SCP-7042. SCP-7042 was sequestered in the Archives. 
[[/div]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;++++ Addendum 7042-5: LEVEL 4 SECURITY CLEARANCE REQUIRED&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]

SCP-7042 is currently being reevaluated for placement as Disruption Class Ekhi following the events of Incident-7042-3. 

SCP-7042 has been found to have latent cognitohazardous abilities. To individuals whose career involves the care, breeding, and conservation of animals of any kind, SCP-7042 will shift their perceptions to consider it an object of providence and form a protective, pseudofamilial bond with the object the longer it remains in their possession. If several individuals are infected, they will seek each other out, grouping together into a cult-like organization whose goal is to learn more about SCP-7042 and how to control her powers in the name of conservation, experimentation, and revitalization. 

Furthermore, the estimated upper limit of instances it can create from one entry is now believed to be in the hundreds. 

Instances created by SCP-7042 have been found to have abnormally high fertility rates for their species, often combined with the largest number of offspring being conceived that the mother can carry without becoming endangered. The Foundation has contacted GoI-466 regarding this information taken from the observations of Dr. Erende, now PoI-8843.

**Incident-7042-3.**
During the events of [[[SCP-6500|SCP-6500]]], two dozen members of Site-84 staff vanished, including Dr. Erende and Dr. Waller. SCP-7042 disappeared alongside them. 

Following the cessation of events and consolidation of Foundation forces, MTF Beta-4 &#34;Castaways&#34; and MTF Eta-10 &#34;See No Evil&#34; were sent to investigate escalating reports of &#34;Cryptid&#34; activity in the Australian Outback. They were met with the missing staff of Site-84, numerous SCP-7042-A instances, and SCP-7042. Dr. Erende was not amongst the returned staff, though his documented work with SCP-7042 is archived below. &#34;Gaia&#39;s 42&#34;, which the group had dubbed themselves, put up no resistance and willingly handed over SCP-7042. SCP-7042 appears to be dormant, and plans are in place to transfer it to another Foundation facility. The remainder of the afflicted Foundation Staff have been administered Class C Amnestics and have returned to their positions with Site-84.  

**Notable SCP-7000-A Instances**
* SCP-7042-A36: An instance of SCP-███, though Dr. Erende&#39;s notes detail that it is entirely herbivorous. They are currently contained in High-Security Paddock B6.
* SCP-7042-A37: 60 instances of //Diprotodon optatum//[[footnote]][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diprotodon Driptodon][[/footnote]] Transfer to Biological Research Site-104 pending.
* SCP-7042-A38: 80 instances of //Ceratotherium simum cottoni//. Transfer to Biological Research Site-104 pending.
* SCP-7042-A40: 2 instances of SCP-████, juveniles. Transfer to Biological Research Site-104 pending.
* SCP-7042-A42: 1 deceased instance of //Duro scrofa//[[footnote]][[[SCP-6002|SCP-6002]]][[/footnote]]. A Note was attached to the corpse.

[[include component:image-block | name=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/313822165206171660/999222624230064158/IMG_1887.jpg | caption=Letter Written by PoI-8843 | width=300]]

PoI-8843&#39;s current whereabouts are unknown. However, Foundation personnel has reported sightings of a man resembling his appearance in Greece, where a series of Proto-Sarkic ruins have just been uncovered. The Foundation has just begun consolidating its control over the dig site, and worries of a possible infiltration have led to a transfer of additional security personnel to the region. 

Beta-4 and Eta-10 also reported Sarkic symbology covering most of the 42&#39;s compound and recovered other fresh examples of Sarkic-themed literature to be archived.

SCP-7042&#39;s apparent Sarkic origin is the central line of questioning that will be pursued once the object reanimates.
