The following tests are aimed at exploring the full range of SCP-2209&#39;s simulation capabilities and determining the item&#39;s potential usefulness to the Foundation.

**Test #:** 2209-024515-A
**Date:** ██/04/2007
**Subject:** D-5081; 24-year-old male; charged with grand theft auto, possession of illegal substances.
**Scenario:** Entertainment
**Ultra-Realism Mode:** No
**Test Description:** 

D-5081 assisted into SCP-2209-2 by present staff due to complications with back zipper. Subject provided with earpiece, microphone, chest-mounted camera and vital sign monitor; entered SCP-2209-1. Hatch sealed. Dr. ████████ Davids designated test controller. 

&gt; &lt;begin transcript&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Davids:** D-5081, are you ready to begin? 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-5081:** Yeah. This suit is actually pretty comfy. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Davids:** Can you describe to me what you&#39;re seeing?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-5081:** Can&#39;t see shit through this thing over my face, man... wait - I can see myself!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Davids:** What do you mean?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-5081:** It&#39;s like I&#39;m looking at myself through a whole bunch of cameras. I&#39;m in a big round room. Well, more like I&#39;m inside a giant hamster ball. The walls are white and covered in all these little metal circles. And there&#39;s a big circle in the middle in front of me, with blue lights all around it. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Davids:** Walk towards it. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-5081:** Okay. Damn this feels weird. 
&gt; 
&gt; [Subject regains orientation and steps onto central plate] 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2209-1:** {{Welcome to the Virtual Reality Zone! Please select one of our exciting virtual scenarios. Scenarios include: Entertainment. IQ Challenge. Zero-G Training. Combat Training. Random.}} 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Davids:** Entertainment. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-5081:** Entertainment, please. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2209-1:** {{Would you like to try our new Ultra-Realism Mode?}}  
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Davids:** Say no. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-5081:** No, thanks. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2209-1:** {{Generating scenario: Entertainment. Mode: Standard.}} 
&gt; 
&gt; [Loud &#34;heavy metal&#34; music and the sound of a crowd cheering emanates from SCP-2209-1&#39;s sound system]
&gt; 
&gt; **D-5081:** (shouting) Oh my god; this is awesome! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Davids:** What do you see? 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-5081:** (shouting) I&#39;m on stage at a Slipknot concert! I am literally right behind Taylor! I can even feel how hot it is in here! It&#39;s frickin&#39; incredible! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Davids:** Please stop shouting. Try to interact with one of the projections. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-5081:** Okay. Hello?! Corey?! [brief pause] He&#39;s just ignoring me. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Davids:** Oh well. End the test then. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-5081:** No man, wait! There&#39;s something I have to do first; I&#39;ll probably never get this chance again. 
&gt; 
&gt; [Subject takes three steps forwards, then launches himself into the air. Subject does not fall. Subject remains suspended an estimated 0.8 metres in the air.] 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Davids:** D-5081... how are you doing that?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-5081:** Doing what? I&#39;m crowd-surfing, man! I can feel them pushing me up! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Davids:** Interesting... End the test now. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-5081:** Do I have to? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Davids:** You will comply with orders, D-5081. I repeat: end the test.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-5081:** Okay, okay, I&#39;ll make it stop. Computer guy? Computer guy! Stop the concert! 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2209-1:** {{Would you like to exit this scenario?}} 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-5081:** Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2209-1:** {{Exiting scenario.}} 
&gt; 
&gt; [Sounds of music and cheering cease. Subject falls to the floor.] 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2209-1:** {{Would you like to rate your experience on a scale of one to ten?}} 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-5081:** ...fuck. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2209-1:** {{Thank you! Would you like to try another scenario?}} 
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;end transcript&gt; 

D-5081 reprimanded. Injuries negligible. D-5081 requested to participate in further testing. Request granted on condition that subject co-operate fully with the test controller.

//I am very intrigued as to how SCP-2209 was able to achieve an apparent localized anti-gravity effect. Will conduct more thorough testing during the Zero-G Training scenario.// -  Dr. ████████ Davids

&gt; **SCP-2209-1:** {{Would you like the question to be repeated?}} 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-5081:** Uh... can I have a calculator or something? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2209-1:** {{//Of course.//}} 
&gt; 
&gt; [Subject stares at his left palm for a moment, then makes motions with his right hand, consistent with pushing buttons on a portable calculator.] 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-5081:** Okay, let&#39;s see... radian measure... eighty degrees... in a circle... 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Davids:** Oh, for the love of... one point three nine radians.

&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Davids:** Describe. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-5081:** It seems mostly ordinary. There&#39;s a couch, a TV, some shelves with pictures. But it&#39;s so... //quiet//. Some parts of the place look kind of funny, too; like they don&#39;t belong here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Davids:** Noted. Explore the area.

D-5081 emerged from SCP-2209-1 visibly shaken. Upon interview, D-5081 described encountering multiple tall, black, humanoid entities.

//I ran D-5081&#39;s description through the database - turned up multiple references to an existing item. Is it possible that SCP-2209-1 somehow managed to access one of our servers?// - Dr. ████████ Davids

//Highly unlikely; there have been no reported failures in the unit&#39;s electromagnetic isolation field since SCP-2209 was brought into containment, and our network is secure. I think the more appropriate question to ask would be &#34;Who made this thing?&#34;// - Dr. ████ Carter
