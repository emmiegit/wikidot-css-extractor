**Object Class:** Euclid

Subject is allowed to roam freely withing the facility, and eat in the canteen. Subject is allowed to assist staff in translating documents both modern and ancient of Chinese and Mongolian origin and in the re-containment and/or containment breaches of Euclid and Keter objects if needed. Object is to always wear a tracking device around her left arm. No diary products are allowed to be given to SCP-7927, as she is severely lactose intolerant. Room is to be always between 20 degrees Centigrade and 40 degrees Centigrade. 

SCP-7927 is allowed to receive any item of Chinese origin, if requested, within reason (no weapons, or any sharp and/or explosive item is allowed). She is allowed to use a computer , to aide re with translations, so she could directly sent the work.

SCP-7927 is not allowed to receive and consume more than 3 glasses of alcohol (depending on the ABV) under any circumstances, due to her low alcohol tolerance and possible damages that may com after being inebriated. All personnel are to follow this rule.

SCP-7027 is currently contained in Site-19, but previously she was contained in a site in mainland China.

**Description**:  SCP-7927 is a Asiatic draconic entity, which appears as an East-Asian female human. Object appears as a woman, looking to be around 27 years old, but confirmed to be over 10.000 years old. In her human form, SCP-7927 is 158cm tall 43kg. She has long back hair, pale skin, and verry dark almost black green eyes. In her dragon form, SCP-7927 is 40m ling and 10m tall, currently the weight of the object was unable to determine, but is believed to be little over a ton. She has a scaly body, of a dark green almost turquoise hue, with hair on the head neck, spine and end of the tail of a dark turquoise hue. SCP-7927 appears to be a dragon of the Chinese variety, also known as a Long (龙)

Object refers to herself as &#34;Si YuLan&#34; (司玉蓝), and is generally nice to the personnel. She is a very calm individual, with a mastery over self control and awareness. She is hard to anger, and easily dismisses or even ignores tomfoolery. SCP-7927 has a soft spot for children, personnel reporting that&#39;s he would play and even show a motherly instinct  towards SCP children. 

Although SCP-7927 looks like woman in her late 20&#39;s, she more or less acts as an elderly woman. Many withing the facility (mostly the younger personnel and contained anomalies, usually between 14 and 20) call her &#34;aunty&#34;. Once every few years, object will go through a shedding process, where, she will take her draconic form, and in the course of few days, she would shed her old scales.

SCP-7927 has 3 forms: Human, a combination of human and draconic features, and dragon. Object prefers to use her human form, and sometimes will use the intermediary one, still looking like her human self, but with the added horns and tail. Th e dragon form is hardly used, due to the  limitations of the surrounding space.

SCP-7927 anomalous traits are a connection to the elements, particularly fire and wind. capability of manipulating these elements to various effect, from conjuring large-scale cyclones to generating massive firestorms to instantly incinerate large areas. ability to directly modify the weather, notably using rainstorms to put out fires and fog to obscure the vision of incoming attackers. a potent capacity for healing and recovery, capable of recovering from even extremely lethal injuries within short order. Aside that, object has almost full immunity to all types of weaponry, element, and even anomalous objects.

SCP-7927 is docile and willingly compiles with her containment. Object was tested against several Euclid class anomalies, including SCP-682, which resulted in a draw between the two, due to being equally matched.
