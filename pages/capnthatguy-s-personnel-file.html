[[collapsible show=&#34;OOC intro&#34;]]
Hi there!  I&#39;m a guy generally known[[footnote]]To all of three people[[/footnote]] on the internet as CapnThatguy.  I&#39;ve been lurking this site for years ([[[SCP-745]]] was featured when I first got here), but only actually joined in August 2016.  Always trying to strike a balance between the million ideas in my head and actually making those ideas coherent enough to post.  Thankfully, I have thus far succeeded.  I&#39;m occasionally on chat, now that I&#39;ve figured out how to use it, and I&#39;m pretty good about answering PMs, so feel free to talk to me about anything.  I like reading drafts and offering advice.  Also, anytime you&#39;re in the mood to read a draft, feel free to pop into my sandbox and send me a message.  There&#39;s usually something at least partway drafted.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Commentary for those interested&#34;]]
**SCPs**
[[[SCP-2924]]]: My first and currently most successful SCP.  Inspired by [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLAp7QJtKL8 this song], particularly this line:
//When you catch yourself drifting, when your feet leave the ground//
//Wrap your arms around a lamppost, or just drift until you&#39;re found//
Incidentally, that album is my personal soundtrack to the Foundation as a whole.

**Weird Authorial Headcannons Time:** The reason that the hobos are all floating over to Nebraska is because, about 200 feet below the Point of Convergence, there is a &#39;seed&#39; of a Nexus, whose theme is &#34;travelers&#34;. Problem is, no one actually settled close enough to the seed for it to grow into a full-blown Nexus.  If Site-201 ends up becoming a full-fledged research facility in the future, they might be in for quite a surprise as the Nexus blooms around them.

[[[SCP-2927]]]: Based on a recurring nightmare I had as a kid.  I&#39;d have it every 3-4 months from when I was 6 to about 10.  The spots would sit in opposite corners of my room while I stared at them, paralyzed.  I&#39;m glad I don&#39;t have that dream anymore, but I&#39;m even more glad that I never stayed in the dream long enough to see them touch.  I&#39;d give you an authorial word as to what happens when they touch, but honestly, I don&#39;t have one.

[[[SCP-2778]]]: Entry for the 2016 D-Class contest.  My thought process was basically &#34;How long could D-Class use a benign SCP object without the Foundation noticing?&#34;  The answer is: &#34;Until D-23588 makes a joke about Jupiter Ascending and the researchers realize that no one on-site has seen it.&#34;  Also, I hadn&#39;t even thought of the Room of Requirement similarity before people mentioned it in the discussion thread.

**More Headcannons!:** There are half a dozen Anomalous Item Research Sites, one for each continent other than Antarctica.  Their job is to perform every test imaginable on minor anomalous items to see if they have any additional effects beyond what has already been reported.  They  almost never do.  2778 is the first full-fledged SCP they&#39;ve encountered on-site at AIRS-4.

[[[SCP-1981-J]]]: The song had been stuck in my head for a week.  Had to get out somehow.

**Tales**
[[[A Personal Connection]]]: Based at AIRS-4 from [[[SCP-2778]]], shortly after it was discovered.  D-24461 is part of the first group of new D-Classes that knows nothing about the old Secret Break Room.  There isn&#39;t any kind of internal logic to the phone, but my phone number tastes like poutine.  Because I said so.

[[[Inside/Outside]]]: I just really like [[[SCP-2719]]]. [[[SCP-184]]] seemed like the perfect horrible fit.  This is definitely a more literal interpretation of Inside than most, but I think that&#39;s mostly of 184&#39;s influence on it.  Dr. Watkins&#39; ramblings at the end of the tale allowed him to &#39;access&#39; 2719, which gave it the opportunity to kick 184 out, but at the cost of his own life, as 2719/reality tried to right themselves.
