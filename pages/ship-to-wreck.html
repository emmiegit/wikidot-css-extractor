[[span style=&#34;color: midnightblue;&#34;]][http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5825 Site-32] has been in decay for a long time. I need a change of scenery. I need to not remember.

The tragedy sustains me, yes. But it hurts. I need to find a way to live and not hurt.

-----

The towns are always unsettling. Some in ruin, some look as though they never changed.

All of them are rotting in some way. It unsettles me. I move on quickly.

-----

I came across a corpse today. The potential wasted, the life lost, the tragedy. I&#39;ve never felt stronger. It sickens me.

-----

I must be losing it. I saw a shining city in the distance. Must be a mirage.[[/span]]

-----
[[&gt;]]
[[span style=&#34;color: seagreen;&#34;]]Someone new arrived today. Her name is Molly. She doesn&#39;t talk that much, wouldn&#39;t even tell us what kind of being she was so we could accommodate her.

Maybe that&#39;s why I find her intriguing.[[/span]]
[[/&gt;]]
-----

[[span style=&#34;color: midnightblue;&#34;]]The shining city is called Haphway. I had nowhere to stay when I arrived, so I stayed with the daughter of the town&#39;s leader. Her name is Candela. She seems nice, but I fear I scared her off with my silence.

I&#39;ll leave tomorrow. Keep moving onward.[[/span]]

-----
[[&gt;]]
[[span style=&#34;color: seagreen;&#34;]]Molly tried to leave this morning. My mother and I convinced her. Mami used her patented kindness guilt: &#34;am I such a poor custodian that I&#39;ve run you out of town already?&#34;

I hope she stays for longer.[[/span]]
[[/&gt;]]
-----

[[span style=&#34;color: midnightblue;&#34;]]I spent the day with Candela again. She showed me around. In all my travels I&#39;d never seen a place filled with such hope. All the exploring wore me out.

I hope she has time for me again tomorrow.[[/span]]

-----
[[&gt;]]
[[span style=&#34;color: seagreen;&#34;]]Molly is gentle. We&#39;ve been spending nearly every day together since she arrived. She&#39;s acclimating to life in Haphway well.

I think she might want to stay.[[/span]]
[[/&gt;]]
-----

[[span style=&#34;color: midnightblue;&#34;]]I&#39;ve found I enjoy life in Haphway. It exhausts me, but I don&#39;t want to leave.[[/span]]

-----
[[&gt;]]
[[span style=&#34;color: seagreen;&#34;]]She&#39;s opening up more with each day.[[/span]]
[[/&gt;]]
-----

[[span style=&#34;color: midnightblue;&#34;]]Candela and I are getting closer.[[/span]]

-----
[[&gt;]]
[[span style=&#34;color: seagreen;&#34;]]Molly&#39;s hands always feel cold.[[/span]]
[[/&gt;]]
-----

[[span style=&#34;color: midnightblue;&#34;]]Candela tastes like cherries and vanilla.[[/span]]

-----
[[&gt;]]
[[span style=&#34;color: seagreen;&#34;]]With Molly&#39;s body pressed against mine, I feel a warmth I haven&#39;t felt in a long time.[[/span]]
[[/&gt;]]
-----

[[span style=&#34;color: midnightblue;&#34;]]The city doesn&#39;t exhaust me, I&#39;m simply getting weaker. I haven&#39;t known tragedy in so long.

Shouldn&#39;t that irony be tragedy enough?[[/span]]

-----
[[&gt;]]
[[span style=&#34;color: seagreen;&#34;]]Molly seems to be getting sick. She insists she&#39;s fine.

She&#39;s lying.[[/span]]
[[/&gt;]]
-----

[[span style=&#34;color: midnightblue;&#34;]]I couldn&#39;t move today. I won&#39;t corrupt this city to sustain myself.[[/span]]

-----
[[&gt;]]
[[span style=&#34;color: seagreen;&#34;]]Molly won&#39;t tell us how we can help her. I still don&#39;t know what she is.[[/span]]
[[/&gt;]]
-----

[[span style=&#34;color: midnightblue;&#34;]]Candela offered to take me to the town&#39;s doctor, a skilled lich who uses magic to diagnose problems.

I declined. If I am to perish in Haphway, so be it. I&#39;ve never been happier.[[/span]]

-----
[[&gt;]]
[[span style=&#34;color: seagreen;&#34;]]It hurts to see her suffer. It hurts more that she won&#39;t let us help.[[/span]]
[[/&gt;]]
-----

[[span style=&#34;color: midnightblue;&#34;]]I compelled today. I collapsed in the middle of the street and when I woke up I was in my siren form, compelling the town&#39;s residents toward me. A few more steps and they all would&#39;ve tumbled off a cliff.

As soon as I was able to turn back into a human I did. The town&#39;s residents seemed broken.

I ran.[[/span]]

-----
[[&gt;]]
[[span style=&#34;color: seagreen;&#34;]]Something happened with Molly today. I wish she had told me. We could&#39;ve helped her.

I fear she&#39;s going to try to take off again.[[/span]]
[[/&gt;]]
-----

[[span style=&#34;color: midnightblue;&#34;]]I&#39;ve been sitting at the edge of town for hours. I know what I must do, but I can&#39;t make myself leave.

It&#39;s dark when Candela&#39;s mother finds me. I fear she&#39;s going to get angry with me, exile me on the spot. Instead she sits and we talk.[[/span]]
@@@@
[[&gt;]]
[[span style=&#34;color: seagreen;&#34;]]Mami and I have been looking for Molly all day. Mami found her first. They don&#39;t know I&#39;m listening.[[/span]]
[[/&gt;]]
[[span style=&#34;color: midnightblue;&#34;]]She says I don&#39;t have to leave. A kind offer, if a hollow one.[[/span]]
@@@@
[[&gt;]]
[[span style=&#34;color: seagreen;&#34;]]Mami begs Molly to stay. Molly doesn&#39;t seem to take it in

Molly finally reveals she&#39;s a siren. Strengthened and kept alive by tragedy.[[/span]]
[[/&gt;]]
[[span style=&#34;color: midnightblue;&#34;]]She says there are people in town who could help. But there&#39;s no helping this.[[/span]]
@@@@
[[&gt;]]
[[span style=&#34;color: seagreen;&#34;]]Molly refuses help, insists it&#39;s impossible.

Until today, I thought sirens in general to be impossible.[[/span]]
[[/&gt;]]
[[span style=&#34;color: midnightblue;&#34;]]She says a bit of tragedy is healthy, keeps us human.

But for me, tragedy is the very thing separating me from humanity. It&#39;s why I was kept alive.[[/span]]
@@@@
[[&gt;]]
[[span style=&#34;color: seagreen;&#34;]]Mami tries to explain that the residents of the town would be willing to withstand a little tragedy every now and then to help her, but Molly cuts her off before she can.

Her tragedy makes her feel less than. Inhuman.

She&#39;s not going to change her mind.

I go back home.[[/span]]
[[/&gt;]]
[[span style=&#34;color: midnightblue;&#34;]]I want so desperately to be able to stay. But the only thing I want more is to not hurt these kind people who took me in and made me feel alive again.

But it&#39;s late. I&#39;m tired. And I want to go home.[[/span]]
-----
[[&gt;]]
[[span style=&#34;color: seagreen;&#34;]]It&#39;s late when Molly slips in. She thinks I&#39;m sleeping.

She doesn&#39;t say anything as she gets in bed next to me and kisses me on the forehead for the last time.
-----
She&#39;s gone before I wake up.

And my heart hurts knowing she&#39;s alone again.[[/span]]
[[/&gt;]]
-----

[[span style=&#34;color: midnightblue;&#34;]]I can&#39;t find a way to live and not hurt. Somebody has to hurt for me to live. And as selfish as it is, I don&#39;t want to die.

But I can&#39;t hurt Haphway. I can&#39;t hurt Candela.

-----

The wasteland is lonely.

-----

A lich tried to steal my things today.

I compelled him.[[/span]]
