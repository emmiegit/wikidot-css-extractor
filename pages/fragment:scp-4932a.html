[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-4932/Buildings.png|caption=SCP-4932-1&#39;s point of view as of 5/10/2019|width=300px]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4932 is to be overseen by two researchers who are to record events that occur in SCP-4932-1&#39;s life, including events viewed as boring or irrelevant. A file for every human discovered within SCP-4932 is to be created by these researchers; which describe its facial features, hairstyle, most commonly worn clothes, and any jewelry. Personnel are to note that many SCP-4932-X instances are undocumented despite having appeared within SCP-4932 in the past.

**Description:** SCP-4932 is a small handheld device made out of plastic. Research into SCP-4932&#39;s internal components has been postponed due to fear of permanently damaging it. However, from what research can be performed, it is theorized that SCP-4932&#39;s internal components are non-anomalous as a whole. The word &#34;SAMSUNG&#34; is seen scratched out on the back of the device, and &#34;PROTOTYPE 55&#34; is written above SCP-4932&#39;s screen in permanent marker.

Since 2001, SCP-4932 has been playing the first person perspective of an entity referred to as SCP-4932-1. SCP-4932-1 is, as of the time of writing, an 18 year old male named &#34;Smith.&#34; SCP-4932-1&#39;s nationality and ethnic background is unknown.

Every non-metaphysical entity/object that has appeared on SCP-4932&#39;s screen does not exist within baseline reality. This includes physical locations and geographical history but does not include intangible and/or esoteric concepts, such as the laws of the universe, gender, humanity or the afterlife.

All proper names, including brands, locations, and the country itself, have been replaced with very generic descriptions of the name. For example, all soft drink companies are named &#34;Soda&#34;, all streets are named &#34;Street&#34;, and the country SCP-4932-1 lives in is named &#34;Country&#34;. SCP-4932-X instances all appear to speak English with a Dutch accent. There appears to be countries outside of Country, which are all referred to as &#34;Nation&#34;. SCP-4932-X instances can distinguish between each country&#39;s name by an unknown method.

Every SCP-4932-X instance is named either &#34;John Doe&#34;, &#34;Jane Doe&#34;, or &#34;Justice Doe&#34; if the person is male, female, or nonbinary respectively.

SCP-4932&#39;s purpose is currently unknown.

**Addendum-665:** SCP-4932 was discovered at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean floor 20 kilometers north of the Bikini Atoll in 2004. SCP-4932 appears to be completely waterproof as it survived being at the bottom of the ocean for presumably three years without losing function. Several hollow shells created out of steel and concrete can be seen near the location of SCP-4932&#39;s discovery. It is unknown how the message on SCP-4932 written in permanent marker managed to survive in these conditions.

A flash drive was discovered within the small Inuit village of Ajurnarman which contains several empty folders and an image titled &#34;gogetemtiger.jpg.&#34; After thorough examination of the image, it has been discovered that the person on the right is SCP-4932-1. It has also been discovered that the person on the left does not exist within our reality. Originally, it was unknown how an image of a nonexistent person could be found in baseline reality.

However, several files within DEEPWELL-14 describe the person, but most files were completely unreadable, only slightly protected by the DEEPWELL Faraday well. All the information that could be recovered was that the individual&#39;s name was Johnathan, and that they lived within the vill[DATA CORRUPTED]he flash drive was discovered in.

[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-4932/AlaskaRed.png|caption=Location of [DATA CORRUPTED]narman|width=195px]]

Several individuals from the village were questioned regarding the existence of Johnathan and were shown the photo. From a population of 95, only 7 individuals claimed to remember Johnathan, always in the form of vague memories. Notably, these 7 people describe themselves as being either very good friends or a family member. The only information that they remember regarding the person is their first name and favorite food, which they only described as &#34;fish.&#34;

One member of the village, named [DATA CORRUPTED] stated that all they could remember are large amounts of missing posters of Johnathan before hearing police sirens, and then claimed to not remember anything for a period of 2 days. Attempts are being made to obtain more information regarding Johnatha[DATA CORRUPTED].

**Addendum-668:** By popular vote from the HCML Administration, descriptions of SCP-4932-X instances would be attempted to be matched with descriptions stored within DEEPWELLs 12-16, which all contain information regarding people within the Canadian-Al[DATA CORRUPTED]kan-Siberian region, specifically targeting heavily corrupted documents. The following matches have been found:

&gt; **[DATA CORRUPTED]:** He said goodbye to everyone, said he needed to leave, and went behind the huge hill in our town. I could hear sounds that... sounded like a car? But also didn&#39;t really?
