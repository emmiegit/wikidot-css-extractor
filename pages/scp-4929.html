**Item #:** SCP-4929

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation Site-4929 shall jam the AM frequency of 535 Mhz within a 10-km radius around SCP-4929. Due to SCP-4929&#39;s cultural and historical significance to the People&#39;s Republic of China, it is currently not possible for the Foundation to prevent civilian access to SCP-4929. Mobile Task Force Upsilon-13 &#34;Scarlet Sentinels&#34; shall clandestinely detain all SCP-4929-Individual instances upon detection and administer Class-C amnestics. The release of former SCP-4929-Individual instances is authorized after thirty days.

**Description:** SCP-4929 is Lake Hong (洪湖), located in Hubei, China. SCP-4929 constantly broadcasts an AM signal at 535 Mhz. When demodulated, the signal, designed SCP-4929-Signal, resembles the voice of a middle-aged woman singing the Communist Propaganda Song &#34;洪湖水, 浪打浪&#34;(//&#34;Lake Hong Waters, Wave Upon Wave&#34;//). Signal Analysis of SCP-4929-Signal has found no evidence of mechanical repetition since containment began in 1976. SCP-4929-Signal&#39;s strength drops drastically at 4.37km from the shores of the lake, and is effectively undetectable at 10km.

Upon exposure to SCP-4929-Signal, individuals first experience a strong sense of calm. 30 minutes after exposure, up to 2% of individuals exposed, designated SCP-4929-Individual, will then experience a strong sense of anger and loss. SCP-4929-Individual instances uniformly refer to SCP-4929 as &#34;Mother&#34;. 

SCP-4929-Individual instances tend to fit the following profile: 
* Male
* Between ages 20-35
* Has a strong sense of duty to family
* A contempt for authority, especially centralized authority
* Impulsion

120 hours after exposure, SCP-4929-Individual instances will seek out other SCP-4929-Individual instances. Once a group of 1500 SCP-4929-Individual instances gather within a radius of 500m, those instances will organize into a group designated SCP-4929-Group. SCP-4929-Individual instances describe SCP-4929-Group as a &#34;Revolutionary Army of Liberation&#34;. Once part of a SCP-4929-Group, SCP-4929-Individual instances develop a uniform set of language skills regardless of prior background, including: fluency in Old, Middle, and modern Chinese, English, and what is presumed to be the Chu Language that was spoken in the region during the Zhou Dynasty (1046-256 BCE).

Once an SCP-4929-Group instance forms, SCP-4929-Individual instances will form groups of five and commit petty theft of farming implements and metallic utensils like meat cleavers in the nearby villages and townships. Some SCP-4929-Individual instances have been observed to steal cars and trucks. SCP-4929-Individual instances will take the pilfered items and vehicles back to SCP-4929 and sink them into the waters. SCP-4929 waters will boil within a 10m radius of the offering location for 37 minutes. SCP-4929-Individual instances will then begin retrieving items from SCP-4929, which will consist of mostly Hanyang 88 rifles and 8mm Mauser cartridges.

Once each SCP-4929-Individual instance receives a rifle and five cartridges, they will organize into a military unit consisting of a number of regiments[[footnote]]Unlike a typical regiment, which consists of around 1,000-5,500 men, known SCP-4929-Group regiments usually number less than 60 SCP-4929-Individual instances. Records show, however, that SCP-4929-Group regiments consisted of more SCP-4929-Individual instances in the past.[[/footnote]] and one individual designated the group&#39;s historian, The SCP-4929-Group instance will then divide into its component regiments and begin attacking nearby villages. These attacks will rarely be successful as local law enforcement possess superior weaponry and training. Despite this, the SCP-4929-Group instance will continue its attacks until every instance other than the historian is incapacitated. The historian, who will be recording the progress of the SCP-4929-Group instance in the war diary, will make a note of the official disbandment of the group, and then commit suicide by drowning in SCP-4929.

As of March 7th, 1990, 12 SCP-4929-Group instances had been observed and 836 SCP-4929-Group war diaries and diary fragments have been recovered. Most of those instances are written in the presumed Chu Language and have not been fully translated. Notable translated instances include:

&gt; 
&gt; (Note: This was the first discovered instance of SCP-4929 not being in control of an entire rebellion.)

**Update August 4th, 2013:** The People&#39;s Republic of China completed the Three Gorges Dam Project on July 4th, 2012. Negotiations with the Communist Party of China regarding the dam project was not met with success. As such, from the beginning of the dam project on April 3rd, 1992, SCP-4929 has been losing water as the dam project held up more of the Yangtze River behind it during construction, reaching a final average area of around 350 km[[$^{2}$]]. SCP-4929-Signal&#39;s strength weakened by a factor of around 2% every year. 

One War Diary fragment was recovered despite no known SCP-4929-Group instance forming on April 22nd, 2013.

&gt; Save the children...
