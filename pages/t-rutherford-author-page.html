    width=300px
]]


**Name:** Dr(?) Prof(?), QC(?), The Revd Fr.(?) T. Rutherford.

**Security Clearance:** 1-4, and hopefully never 5.

**Location:** All.

**Duties:** Research Head, Data Entry Clerk, Janitor, Janitorial Director, Archivist, Foundation Certified Dentist, Foundation Certified Physician, Foundation Certified Cannibal, Payroll Accountant, Anomalous Art Historian, Licensed Ectoentropic Waste Disposal Expert, Site Barber, Security Officer, Hazardous Materials Logistics Expert, Cafeteria Staff, Maintenance Worker, Field Agent, Containment Cell Architect, and Barista. 

------

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Staff should engage with with T. Rutherford relative to whatever role he is currently occupying. Under no circumstances should attention be drawn to the inconsistency/impossibility of his shifting professions.  

**Description:** T. Rutherford is a man in his late 20&#39;s, pale in complexion, with dark brown hair and hazel eyes. Despite having been &#34;employed&#34; at the Foundation for 11 years, there is no record of Mr. Rutherford ever having been hired.

At the beginning of a standard work day, T Rutherford will unassumingly enter a Foundation site, usually during periods of high staff ingress. At the end of the work day, he will disappear in a similar fashion. Tracking devices, isotope tagging, and direct tailing efforts have revealed that Rutherford does not tangibly exist outside of this time-frame. For periods of 8 - 250 hours, Rutherford will assume an arbitrary position within the Foundation. He will possess all required skills and credentials to fulfill this role, if only to an unremarkable level. These skills range from basic masonry, all the way to string-theory mechanics.

Due to staff density, T Rutherfords presence typically goes unnoticed. If ever questioned about his peculiarity, Rutherford will employ various excuses and clumsy gaslighting techniques. These may include:
* &#34;Huh? Who?&#34;
* &#34;... Buddy, have you been huffing amnestics?&#34;
* &#34;You must be thinking of that other guy.&#34; 
* &#34;Janitor!? Look at this badge! I&#39;m your superior officer!&#34;
* &#34;No clue what you&#39;re talking about pal, now you want your lab coat pressed or what?&#34; 
* &#34;Yeah, I&#39;ve got a degree. It&#39;s from the University of Shut Up.&#34;
* &#34;No, //you&#39;re// anomalous!&#34;
* &#34;Good afternoon, and welcome to this symposium on- what? ... No, this is the first time I&#39;ve been to site-21. I&#39;m not sure who you saw unclogging that toilet, but it wasn&#39;t me.&#34;

Rutherford has also given inconsistent answers when asked what the &#34;T&#34; in his name stands for. These have thus far included Terry, Thomas, Tomás, Tyrion, Tango, Tarzan, Tennessee, Tiberius, Tutherford, Ted, and Thorpe.

&gt; __**From the desk of O5-9**__
&gt; 
&gt; //Yes, we know. Just ignore him.//
&gt; 
&gt; //He&#39;s hardly the strangest person we employ. He&#39;s &#34;contained&#34;, harmless, and actually does his job... whatever his job is that day. How about you do the same, and stop bothering us with this crap? We&#39;ve got literal Gods to fight here people. Prioritize.//

&gt; **Secure, Contain,** ,,and so on.,,

&gt; My entry into the 6k contest. I was overjoyed when I saw how well it did, especially against titans like DJKaktus and Rounderhouse (not to mention the Sinister Seven of SCP-6500, Inevitable). 
&gt; 
&gt; Avalon actually began as an SCP idea of a world that simply gave inteligence to &#34;lower lifeforms&#34; like cats, dogs, dolphins, etc. Their new perspectives and genuis created a cooperative Utopia. Then, I started thinking &#34;oh, it might be cute if I include some animal SCPs in there.&#34; and from that, it sort of spiraled out of control. It was more about the Utopia then the animal &#34;anomaly&#34;. That idea just rattled in my head for a while until the 6k contest came around. I thought Nature would be a great theme to work the idea with, and so Avalon was created. 
&gt; 
&gt; Another fun fact: In my original draft of Avalon, I had Dr. Caspian go on his &#34;incredible day&#34; with a copy of himself, while Primrose argued with the SCP Foundation about cooperation. Halfway through writing, I realized I didn&#39;t much like the characters of &#34;Alt Dimensional Caspain&#34; and the &#34;SCP Foundation Ambassador&#34;. They were too similar, and too antagonistic respectively. So I just stuck Caspian and Primrose together, and the chemistry came naturally. 
&gt; 
&gt; Hope you enjoyed the article!

&gt; I&#39;ve struggled with my my eating habits for a very, very long time. I have a very addictive personality. While writing &#34;Karma Kameleon&#34;, I started craving something to snack on. Candy. Chips. Crackers. Something pre-packaged and easy to binge. That compulsion nearly dragged me out the door, even though I knew I&#39;d end up feeling bloated, empty, and ashamed. It&#39;s a struggle I feel a majority of people share. I tried translating that feeling into a story and, well, Vulcan was born.

&gt; The ennui protocol has always been one of my favorite concepts in the SCP, this idea of a last resort &#34;wipe the slate clean&#34; scenario that&#39;s only performed when humanity has lost something so precious, removing our collective memory of it is a mercy. I&#39;ve also worked in children&#39;s media production for 3 years. That definitely shaped this article. I struggled a lot to pin down the format for this piece. The narrative flow is still a bit jagged at the edges, but I&#39;m happy with it.

&gt; Where I work, there&#39;s a small 4-stall dedicated bathroom for our floor. Every time I&#39;m in there, EVERY TIME, the furthest stall is closed. I never know if it&#39;s occupied, or just shut. So there I am, pondering it in silence, and when I finally decide it must just be closed I hear a cough, or a sneaker squeak. It&#39;s Schrodingers stall! I consider myself a high-output introvert, someone who can be very sociable and smooth talking for short periods, but needs a long recharge period alone. Useful during job interviews, not so much for conferences. People assume you&#39;ve got it together, chatting and cracking jokes, but it can be pretty isolating. I wanted to put that feeling into a character, with all the absurdity intact.

&gt; I was inspired to write this when researching neutron stars. //It is currently theorized that heavy elements such as platinum, uranium and gold are created when two neutron stars collide. This celestial collision will cause an explosion, tearing them apart, and scattering their metals throughout the universe.// I wanted to try and write another &#34;deeper mystery&#34; style article again.

&gt; This article was influenced by the Warriors, Letterkenny, and countless cartoons. After the bleak tone set by //Sweat from the Sun//, I wanted to go back to writing more funny, upbeat articles. Plus, there&#39;s only been a handful of SCPs that write a nice, charming love-story that involves the anomaly in some way. I can understand why not many people try and tackle this subject, but I thought I&#39;d give it a shot. Hopefully, this is as fun to read as it was to write.

&gt; For the month of October, I had a much different, much more horror-themed article in mind. The scope of it got away from me, and the SCP lore involved meant a lot more research time. September 27th rolled up, and I had nothing ready to post. Then, when listening to Far Caspian, I had the idea for 4382. That, in turn, lead me to an idea for a series, but that&#39;s a different story. Hulwick was based off my experiences in Algiers, New Orleans. My father and I visited there while on vacation. All the decorations and empty streets made me feel like I was walking through an autumn postcard. I hope you enjoy it.

&gt; My entry for the 5k contest. A collection of apocalyptic tales based around both the Pandoras box and Four Horsemen mythos. Also a play on the &#34;there is no canon&#34; concept of the Foundation, wherein all these realities presented could be true, or none of them might be. All that matters, the only mystery they present worth solving isn&#39;t &#34;what&#39;s in the box?&#34; but a question all good apocalyptic fiction asks: what about the world is worth saving? When the planet itself is a burning house, what do we grab on the way out while letting everything else burn? This was a bit outside my usual wheelhouse, and played pretty fast and loose with the format, and GOD did I have next to no time for editing, but I&#39;m happy with it.

&gt; Another foray into the world of Xi-5, and the newly minted &#34;Locked Scenarios&#34;. I see this kind of anomalous repetition often in science fiction, horror, and of course SCP canon. It needed some solid faux-science to pin it down, because what else is the Foundation good for? I came up with this one based off a real-life experience when I was younger, coupled with some influences from my Drama days. I hope you enjoy!

&gt; I don&#39;t like tapioca. They&#39;re slimy and squishy and resemble gigantified caviar. My partner, however, loves them, and all derivatives of bubble tea. They also make a point of slurping them loudly whenever possible, and as close to my ear as possible. Like all my articles, this vaguely indescribable feeling of discomfort and disgust needed to be turned into a writing project, because where the heck else am I going to derive inspiration from?

&gt; My first article after a year hiatus. Something I toyed with back before I had to stop writing - partially due to work, partially due to settling into a new living arrangement. 2020 has a way of slowing you down. Nicki Knows was something I played with during a writing exercise - making a very minor &#34;superpower&#34; part of a much bigger story; making something mundane the deciding factor in control of the entire world. I also felt like writing a new meta-narrative style story, since Karma Kameleon was so dark fun! I hope you enjoy/enjoyed reading this one.

&gt; The first thing I ever submitted to the site. I&#39;d had it in my back pocket so long, I can&#39;t even remember where the idea came from! Most likely after reading an article involving amnestics, I started playing a scene out in my head. Then, out loud. I do that a lot. You can thank the IRC chat for every article that followed this, because if I hadn&#39;t received such a positive response, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d have kept submitting! Writing, sure, but knowing there was a community here that enjoyed my writing really motivated me to keep submitting. So, thanks chat!
