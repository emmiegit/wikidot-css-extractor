    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Name:** Dr. Jacob &#34;Kens&#34; Kensington

**Security Clearance Level:** █

**Occupation:** Biomedical Researcher and Robotics Specialist

**Duties:** Study of biological and technological SCPs; development of field robotics, advanced prosthetic devices, and neural interfaces for aforementioned prosthetic devices.

**Location:** Based at Site-19, but consults where needed.

**History:** Harking from a town in central New Jersey, Jacob Kensington grew up working with biological lab work, medical training, and engineering influences. After leading a small robotics team against other teams in an international competition and sequencing and analyzing dozens of unique DNA and protein sequences for a local university while in high school, he was accepted at Johns Hopkins for their Biomedical Engineering program and Medical Program. Having spent 8 years there, he graduated with a PhD in BME and an MD...after which he went back to get a PhD in robotics. He eventually got a job working with a start-up electronics company known as Psionics International, but after a few run-ins with various SCPs - and having successful contained them - he was contracted by the Foundation, where he currently works.

Following a lab accident on July 8th, ████, he lost his biological right arm. He was able to replace it with a prototype prosthetic arm that he&#39;d been developing for the Foundation.

------

**Note:** Yes, he has a bionic right arm. Yes, there are other ones that he is prototyping. No, you cannot have one. No, he will not make you into a super-powerful cyborg.

------

To-Do:
* Foundation tale about Kens&#39; first meeting with the Foundation.
* Foundation tale about insect SCPs and guides to certain things.
* Pseudacteon spirali: Insect SCP based on the Phoridae species of fly.
* Tale about the truth behind the Theory of Everything.
* The Abyssal Tree: SCP about the root of everything. Okay, not that dramatic.
* Propaganda Posters about the SCP universe.
