Rashaun shook his head. //What did I just watch?// he thought, as he opened his laptop. He entered the keycode for a Foundation online conference room and waited for the other members of his emergency meeting to arrive. He watched his webcam light pop on. //Who else sees this?//

The first person to appear was a large, heavyset man, black hair cropped short, wide spaced eyes, upturned, pursed lips. &#34;Hey,&#34; he said nonchalantly, lifting his head in a quick jerk in greeting. &#34;Jorge Ruiz. Beta-5. Babysitters.&#34;

&#34;Field Agent Rashaun Washington,&#34; came the reply. 

The next window opened. Red hair and beard, black glasses, black shirt. &#34;Hi. Jason Allen. Mu-4. Debuggers.&#34;

Immediately thereafter, a third appeared. Long, straight black hair, bony face, sharp cats-eye spectacles. &#34;Karen Wu. Gamma-5. Red Herrings.&#34;

&#34;Please to meet you,&#34; Rashaun replied. &#34;Rob&#39;ll join us in a bit, but he wanted us to start without him. Something about his daughter. Did you all get to see the video? Bits, anyway?&#34;

Jorge looked away from the screen and swallowed. &#34;Um, yeah.&#34;

Karen scowled and clicked her tongue. &#34;Disgusting. Can&#39;t blame Rob on checking.&#34;

Jason smirked. &#34;Nope! But that&#39;s SOP for me. I deal with cognitohazards and memetics regularly. I&#39;m more interested with how it travels instead of what&#39;s on it, anyway. Let me guess, it&#39;s about a girl and a rope?&#34;

Rashaun, a bit stunned by the question, replied, &#34;Yeah...&#34;

&#34;Right, I don&#39;t need to see that. But I checked her user page out. She&#39;s posted 5 videos, none getting more than 50 views. She posted this one after school today and got...&#34; Jason tapped away on his keyboard. &#34;...3,407 views. Not terrible, but rising fast. Where did you get your link from?&#34;

&#34;Uh, my friend James?&#34;

&#34;Do you know where he got it from?&#34;

&#34;No. I better ask.&#34;

&#34;Do that. In the meantime, I&#39;ll get it taken down, send out the crawlers to track any other postings. I&#39;ll check the comments on this and other videos, see if there&#39;s someone in common who would spread this, get the word out.&#34;

&#34;We&#39;ll likely need to pick her up, too, Jason. Could you send us her address, please?&#34; Jorge asked. His voice was quieter than his frame suggested.

&#34;Absolutely.&#34;

Another window appeared, showing a balding, middle-aged man, neat, middle-management corporate. &#34;Sorry I&#39;m late.&#34;

&#34;No problem,&#34; Jorge replied. &#34;How&#39;s Olivia?&#34;

Rob smiled. &#34;Doing well, thank you, Jorge. She&#39;s writing a new song. I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll want to share it with you when it&#39;s finished.&#34;

&#34;I&#39;d love to hear it,&#34; Jorge added brightly. &#34;So I guess that means I&#39;ll be headed out to debrief and contain Maci?&#34;

Rob nods. &#34;Once we determine the nature of the anomaly we&#39;re dealing with. Rashaun, I want you flying out to...&#34;

&#34;Montclair, New Jersey,&#34; Jason responded.

&#34;Newark Airport first thing tomorrow. Jorge will have a team available to complete any extraction necessary, but you&#39;ll field interview Maci first and make sure she&#39;s actually anomalous, and also not going to turn into a black hole or anything like that.&#34;

&#34;Actually anomalous, sir? Do you think this might be all some trick?&#34;

&#34;Well,&#34; piped in Karen, &#34;the video is a hoax.&#34;

Rashaun spurted. &#34;A hoax?! You mean we&#39;re running in circles over nothing?&#34;

&#34;Sure, just look at the video. There&#39;s a region of anti-aliasing artifacts just to Maci&#39;s left. Someone accepting the rope has been edited out of the footage. I&#39;ll show you the error level analysis in a bit.&#34;

//Really? I&#39;m just an overreacting doofus? No, that&#39;s not me.// Rashaun shook his head. &#34;Are you sure? Why would someone spoof this?&#34;

&#34;Plenty of reasons. People wanting to show off their editing skills. Something designed to go viral. Guerrilla marketing for a movie, perhaps. Think Occam&#39;s Razor, Rashaun. It&#39;s far more likely that this is fake, anyway.&#34;

Rashaun sighed, disappointed in himself. &#34;If you say so, I guess that&#39;s that, then.&#34;

Karen grinned impishly. &#34;No, Rashaun, that&#39;s just a bunch of image forensics technobabble. Truth is, this looks like the genuine article. I&#39;m just working on the cover story that we&#39;ll release to the public should we fail to get this thing out of the web. If we can&#39;t get the video removed everywhere, we&#39;ll replace the YouTube one with our version, edited to look like things were erased in the background, and then debunk our own work. Legerdemain is still a possibility, but it would have to be expertly executed. Considering that she&#39;s only posted a handful of other videos and doesn&#39;t have any growing web presence before this event, the chances of guerrilla marketing are slim to none. What would they be selling, anyway?&#34;

Rashaun rolled his eyes. &#34;Why&#39;d you have me going on about the whole thing being a hoax, then?&#34;

&#34;I love my job.&#34;

Rob interrupted. &#34;Well, then, it sounds like we all know what to do, then. Rashaun, meet up with Jorge in Newark and track down Maci. Jason, clear out any and all repostings you can find.&#34;

Jason sucked in some air and replied, &#34;Easier said than done, this will have entered into the dark web a couple times. But hey, we Debuggers are the Mole Rats of the Internet. I think I&#39;ve found who&#39;d advertise this video in the first place. Someone hiding his tracks called baaasheep. He was suggesting dares to Maci. Might have an interest in her.&#34;

Rashaun shuddered, and everyone else went silent for a moment. Jorge was first to speak, urgency in his voice. &#34;Get me anything you can on baaasheep, Jason. And Karen, if we Herring the video, promise me you&#39;ll throw in a clause about telling the kids not to try this at home? Please?&#34;

&#34;I and every single investigatory website out there, of course!&#34;

&#34;Great,&#34; Rob concluded. &#34;Thanks, everyone, for signing in on such short notice after hours. Protocol for a viral, but we all know why. Good night, everyone!&#34;

The meeting ended. Rashaun slipped into professional mode and purchased his ticket and packed a bag.
