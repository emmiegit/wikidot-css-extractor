Acquired a new notebook. Old one was full, and I never liked it much anyway. This one is much better honestly. Bigger too.
@@ @@
Anyway, I&#39;m at a parking lot. Going to have breakfast.
@@ @@
Maybe I&#39;ll order pancakes again. I got time before new job. Got to do retrieval.

CI transport at 2:00 pm -- Be at vantage point
GOC ambush at 2:15 -- slip by, acquire target

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;page&#34;]]

At vantage point. 5 minutes to go.
@@ @@
See GOC strike team. Their new camouflage tech isn&#39;t as great against skilled eyes. __NOTE:__ Remember that detail.
@@ @@
Got uniform from Lefty that affect perception to see it as GOC or CI for an observer. Will slip by both sides. Handy, pun not intended.
@@ @@

@@ @@
Acquired the target. There were was difficulty due to thuamaturgic enhanced weapons, but prevailed. Target is a blackbox with a 7-digit combo. Cracked it in 4 secs. Inside is an item from Dr. Wondertainment named &#34;Insta-Icee Cones&#34; that come in 4. Packaging is made in shape of a freezer. Really cold to the touch.
@@ @@
Meeting client behind of a Toys R Us as stated by them. Odd but they pay.
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;page&#34;]]

Client was found spray painting insults on the wall directed at Toys R Us. Client was happy at my arrival, and attempted to hug me. Noticed that client grew a yellow tail.
@@ @@
Client expressed satisfaction and stated his affection for Dr. Wondertainment products. He explained he attempted to purchase the retrieved item (a discontinued product) originally by MC&amp;D Ltd, though was banned. Looking into the situation, he would grow frustrated and childishly threaten patrons according to records. Last straw was when he threw 2 pretzels at the auctioneer after losing bid to a CI operative.
@@ @@
Client, with a piece of chalk, drew a door and opened it. Other side was a swirling vortex of colors, which he jumped through. The drawn door then disappeared in a cloud of smoke.
@@ @@
Money (10 k) was also found to be fake, memetic agent was cast on them to disguise the fact. They actually were just Monopoly bills.
@@ @@
[[size 150%]] **__To Do:__**  [[/size]]
* look further into client. Check Wonder City (or was it World?) records for possible residence. 
* return uniform to Lefty
* get new memetic inoculations, keep better record on when they expire.
* maybe ask waitress out from diner earlier if nothing else.
