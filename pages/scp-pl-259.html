**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-PL-259 is currently contained in Sector C at Level 3 of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-120 Site 120]. Object must be under constant supervision and protection by the facility personnel. In the event of loss of the facility, notify O5 Command immediately.

The object is currently contained by a thaumaturgic circle, thanks to which it is surrounded by an iron shell and the life of the object is supported. --Both circles-- The circle should be maintained at least once every --16 months-- 3 years. Research on the object and conservation of circles are responsibility of --Dr. Gabriel Deamonne-- --Dir. Daniel Asheworth-- Dr. Lucretia Deamonne.

Entities designated SCP-PL-259-2 should be sent to Site PL-47 for neutralization.

**Update from the day 04.11.2010:** Following the  [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/10-kwietnia-2010|death of Dr. Gabriel Deamonne]]], the object research and the task of maintaining the circles were assigned to Director Daniel Asheworth.

**Update from the day 06.04.2013:** Research on the object and the maintenance of security measures have been transferred to Dr. Lucretia Deamonne. Using the new knowledge and security methods, it was possible to combine both circles into one and extend their operation period to 3 years.

**Description:** SCP-PL-259 is a male belonging to the species //homo sapiens sidhe// from the 13th century. He was brought back to life through thaumaturgic necromancy[[footnote]] It is unknown how the group responsible for this obtained information about carrying out such practices. [[/footnote]]. Due to the use of these practices, the subject lost a large part of its previously possessed thaumaturgic abilities, and led to some degree of cognitive impairment (which also occurred in SCP-PL-259-2), as a countermeasure to the subject was imposed several thaumaturgic circles, partially neutralizing them.

The object itself comes from Mongolia, but on closer examination, it was discovered that it is a distant descendant of [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ralliston-s-proposal|PoI-001-C (&#34;Queen Mab&#34;)]]]. At the time of containment, the subject was mounted on an instance of SCP-PL-259-2, which could be identified as a Mongolian steppe horse.

SCP-PL-259 is known to the public as Genghis Khan, a 13th century khan who united all the Mongolian peoples under his rule in 1206, after which he set out to find a better place to live for his people, mainly through conquest.

Entities classified as SCP-PL-259-2 are both humanoid and animal entities. Characterized by being brought back to life by SCP-PL-259 using necromantic thaumaturgy. According to data collected by the Foundation, the total number of both humanoid and animal entities was around two million at their peak, but most were destroyed. Four entities are actively stored from this group, kept at Site PL-49.

The events of 1949 are not the first appearance of SCP-PL-259. In 1206, Genghis Khan, using both his leadership and thaumaturgic skills, united the majority of the human Mongol peoples. Most of his army and population were mostly human, however, virtually all command and SCP-PL-259 were Fae, and information about this was known only to them and a select few higher ranking humans. Despite this, it has come to be known as the Second Fae Empire.

[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-pl.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-pl-259/secondfaeempire|caption=Territory of the Second Fae Empire, as of 1220.|width=300px]]

The empire managed to quickly destroy the decaying [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/daevite-hub Daevite Empire] in the initial periods of conquest which was once a power in the region. Second Fae Empire made a significant expansion, which, however, stopped at the attempt to enter deeper into European territory and at the attempts to attack Japan. There were bloody fights between traditional armies and European thaumaturges, and the forces of Genghis Khan, which eventually led to his death in 1227 after 7 years of fighting. The period of existence of the Second Fae Empire from the battles with the Devites to death in 1227 are defined as IV Occult War. After the leader&#39;s death, the Second Fae Empire was quickly divided among the descendants of Khan, leading to it&#39;s eventual collapse.

------

On July 26, 1949, several Mongolian and Siberian Foundation sites detected high fluctuations in the Hume and EVE fields in the central Mongolia region. The agents sent to those regions did not return, and for the next few weeks, unclear news from the surrounding villages were heard about the dead rising from the graves and seizing weapons found nearby, and then heading towards the Mongol-Chinese border. As local outposts did not want to risk losing more agents, it was decided that an expedition of specially trained agents and thaumaturges would be dispatched from Site 120 to confirm reports of an &#34;undead army.&#34;

On August 26, 1949, the group led by the agent Jeremiah Beck reached the place indicated by the Mongolian outposts. It was the vicinity of the Mongolian-Chinese border in the South Gobi region. There, the group observed numerous communities of both equestrian and humanoid instances of SCP-PL-259-2 heading towards the nearby hills. After briefly deliberating and reporting on the first discoveries, Agent Beck decided to follow the instances of SCP-PL-259-2 with two members of the expedition to find out where and for what purpose they were going. The rest of the group were to follow them at a safe distance, to assist the forward agents in the event of an emergency.

[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-pl.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-pl-259/g%C3%B3ra|caption=A mountain where approximately 2 million instances of SCP-PL-259-2 have gathered; photo taken by agent Beck.]]

After several dozen minutes of following the group of SCP-PL-259-2, the agents reached the foot of the mountain, where they stopped for Agent Beck to take some photos for documentation. They also decided to bypass the mountain, as by climbing it they could expose themselves to the sight of the instances being tracked. It took the agents about an hour to bypass the facility, but almost as soon as they reached their destination, Agent Beck ordered the retreat.

As he later testified at Site 120, on the other side of the mountain was an army of 1,000 or even a million, consisting of instances of SCP-PL-259-2. Most of them were armed with Mongolian armor similar to those from the 13th century. Agent Beck also mentioned that on one of the slopes of the mountain, above the grouping of instances, he saw a tall man riding an unnatural horse. The man was accompanied by several Fae. Given the context of the events known later, it is suspected that they were members of GoI-120 (&#34;Triumviraté&#34;),[[footnote]] An organized monarchist Fae terrorist group focused on reclaiming its supposedly lost territory back from humanity. [[/footnote]] which most likely led to the resurrection of SCP-PL-259.

**__DISRUPTION CLASS:__** Keneq

----
**__EVENT SUMMARY:__** The army of SCP-PL-259 entered the civil war-torn lands of the Republic of China. Despite the resistance of the nationalist troops, the territories of northern China were quickly taken over. There was a threat of them taking the entire country. As they headed south, instances of SCP-PL-259-2 unknowingly aided the Chinese communist army by dismantling the Kuomitang forces. When they reached the central part of the country, the government of the Republic of China evacuated the capital, making it easier for Mao Zedong&#39;s supporters to seize power in the country.

Any information about the &#34;undead army&#34; going outside the country was falsified by the Foundation. Information on how to further resolve the case is available below.

**Dr Rahul:** Thank you, gentlemen for coming, I would like to go straight to the point. So we have an army of over a million undead against us, a small group of Triumviraté and a necromancer thaumaturgist. You have surely read the additional details in the reports provided to you.

**Operator Gregory:** So our solution to this Gray-Blue Type, well, the easiest one would be to just kill the main subject. There is a hideously big difference between us and him, both in terms of strength - although his army is still quite large - and technology, so preparing the right circle and marking Khan as a target shouldn&#39;t be a problem.

**Dr Rahul:** Oh, I see. Then the army would lose its brain. Without orders, they would either return to the dead, or at least it would be much easier for us to get rid of them. So we can conclude that we have the overall plan in pla-

**Dr Deamonne:** If I can cut in.

**Dr Rahul:** I&#39;ll allow it.

**Dr Deamonne:** I myself do not have as much experience as you gentlemen, but I have a slightly different idea. Killing Genghis Khan will do nothing, he has already been killed once. They could revive him again. He suggests using the circles again, but this time two. The first one is to trap the object in a statue of iron that would cover its body-

**Operator Kris:** Sounds ... pretty brutal. And the object will surely die from lack of air..

**Dr Deamonne:** That is why, together with Dr. Rahul, we will try to make a second circle aimed at supporting the life of Genghis Khan. Just enough that he would not be able to free himself, but also enough that he would not die. Technically, he will be dead, but any attempt to bring him back to life will fail, because he is still alive.

**Operator Kris:** All you need to do is keep Genghis and Triumviraté busy so that they have something to focus on in battle. So that we can get the job done.

**Operator Gregory:** Illusory thaumaturgy?

**Operator Kris:** No, they&#39;ll find out it&#39;s not a real threat too soon... It has to be something real... But strong enough to survive the fight to complete the circles.

**Dr Rahul:** Something can be arranged...

+ Containment proposal for SCP-PL-259

Due to the fact that we do not have much spare time and the threat from the undead army is looming, together with our colleagues from the GOC we managed to develop a temporary, but perhaps effective method of securing the object

Using two thaumaturgic circles, the first is designed to immobilize and paralyze an object by covering it with a thick layer of iron. In this way, he will not be able to manage his army or form his own circles, thanks to his  [[[wniosek-o-dotacje-na-opracowanie-srodka-przeciwko-alergii|inborn alergy to iron]]][[footnote]] Although this disease was characteristic of the lower social classes of the Fae, as a result of years of blood mixing in SCP-PL-259&#39;s ancestors, SCP-PL-259 was also said to suffer from the condition. [[/footnote]]

The second circle, on the other hand, is to support his life, if we manage to lock the statue made of the first circle in a safe location, while spreading disinformation that Genghis Khan has died. The next groups will try to summon him or resurrect him, using necromantic circles. However, they will fail. Because the object will live on. In incredible pain and lack of comfort, but he will be alive.

Below I am attaching a visualization of the two circles superimposed on each other. Perhaps in the future we will be able to limit this to one circle, but for now it&#39;s good enough.

------

**PARTICIPATING UNITS:** MTF Alfa-5 (&#34;Diesel Gear Rising&#34;), MTF Nu-7 (&#34;Hammer Down&#34;), MTF Kappa-3 (&#34;Grvediggers, MTF Sigma-80 (&#34; Flying Carpet &#34;) and Strike Team 1431 &#34;Scarlet Company&#34; and Strike Team 1332 &#34;Tibetan Monks&#34; from GOC

**GOAL:** Contain SCP-PL-259 (KTE-1206-Blue-Gray-Cottingley) and prevent the rise of the Third Fae Empire.

**OVERVIEW OF KEY THREATS:**

SCP-PL-259, a highly skilled thaumaturgist, is the primary threat, however other threats are also noted.

* **SCP-PL-259-2**, being an army of 2 million undead, is one of the main threats, if only in the sheer number of entities. They can take more damage than normal humans, so be careful when dealing with them. Cutting off the head should be an 80% effective method of fighting objects.

* **GoI-120 (&#34;Triumviraté&#34;)** members, not too many, the foundation&#39;s data show that there are only six of them, but they should not be ignored. These Fae are fluent in using magic, posing a considerable threat to people unfamiliar with these techniques.

------

**TIMELINE:**

* **7:30, 06.09.1949** -- Foundation forces, along with GOC forces, are based at Lake Barkol Hu in China, a few kilometers from where SCP-PL-259&#39;s army was supposed to be located. Priests of the Reformed Holy Templar Order[[footnote]] Organization belonging to the GOC Council of 108. [[/footnote]] begin the process of blessing the water in the lake, which is to be later used for offensive purposes.

* **8:00, 06.09.1949** -- Two GoI-120 members are sighted with raised hands as they walk towards Foundation and GOC forces. They introduce themselves as Third Empire diplomats and demand a dialogue with the high command in order to offer surrender and coexistence to the Foundation and GOC forces.

* **9:00, 06.09.1949** -- After about an hour, the negotiations end with a failure to reach an agreement, the diplomats are stopped by Foundation forces and the GOC trying to leave.

* **9:15, 06.09.1949** -- In the distance you can clearly hear the sound of horse hooves and throat singing. Most of the units are put on full alert

* **9:20, 06.09.1949** -- 3 tümens[[footnote]] Tümen is a Mongolian formation with 10,000 soldiers.[[/footnote]] SCP-PL-259-2 shower Foundation and GOC forces with a barrage of arrows, then charge up into the force.

* **9:35, 06.09.1949** -- The high losses of the attacking forces due to the use of holy water spraying and thaumaturgically reinforced tanks force them to retreat. Foundation and GOC forces chase after them to finish them off and lead them to SCP-PL-259, and are surprised to be surrounded by the 2 millionth force of SCP-PL-259-2.

* **10:00, 06.09.1949** -- SCP-PL-259 is successfully located on a hill observing the fight statically and not participating in it. Foundation thaumaturges along with Strike Team 1332, lagging slightly behind and unable to circulate before, began preparing the appropriate circles, while MTF Alpha-5 began to attract the main attention of SCP-PL-259-2&#39;s army, allowing the remaining units to recover from the trap.

* **10:20, 06.09.1949** -- 3 tümens of SCP-PL-259-2 have been observed to begin to form into a giant humanoid, causing MTF Nu-7 to focus its fire primarily on it. Strike Team 1431 suffered heavy casualties in combat with SCP-PL-259-2 supported by GoI-120 members.

* **10:35, 06.09.1949** -- A second humanoid is formed which is a combination of 30,000 SCP-PL-259-2. The Alpha-5 formation splits into two teams. The first draws the rest of the army to areas farther from the main battlefield where it will be easy to raid holy water, the second helps Nu-7 fight SCP-PL-259-2. SCP-PL-259 still remains on the hill.

* **10:50, 06.09.1949** -- The first humanoid is destroyed by MTF Nu-7.

* **11:10, 06.09.1949** -- Several members of Kappa 3 are badly injured from thaumaturgic attacks.

* **11:30, 06.09.1949** -- A third humanoid is formed. SCP-PL-259 tore off a chunk of the mountain, which he then tossed, destroying a large portion of Sigma-80.

* **11:38, 06.09.1949** -- There are three Alpha-5 members left, Foundation and GOC forces move to a much stronger defense as the thaumaturges begin to finish preparing the circles.

* **11:57, 06.09.1949** -- Third Alpha-5 member was ripped in half by SCP-PL-259. Members of GoI-120 along with SCP-PL-259 incite a powerful spell thaumaturgically.

* **12:00, 06.09.1949** -- The 1431 Strike Team was completely destroyed by a thaumaturgic attack.

* **12:05, 06.09.1949** -- SCP-PL-259 notices the formation of the Foundation&#39;s and GOC thaumaturgic circles. He starts chanting a spell whereby approximately 80% of his troops (both alive and destroyed in combat) are pulled to the object.

* **12:08, 06.09.1949** -- The fleshy mass of SCP-PL-259 begins to form a giant humanoid with four legs and four blade-like arms. It begins to cover with iron and regenerate as a result of the thaumaturgic circles of the GOC and the Foundation.

* **12:15, 06.09.1949** -- The Alpha-5 member, strengthened with thaumaturgic spells, significantly damages the lower limbs of the object. Then, with the support of Nu-7 artillery, he manages to cut off one of the limbs that are the giant&#39;s blade. With the help of a severed limb, the Alpha-5 operator is able to outweigh SCP-PL-259 and roll it over.

* **12:20, 06.09.1949** -- SCP-PL-259 attempting to retrieve the limb, ressurects using necromancy the 1431 Strike Force back to life, however, due to the immediate attack of Alpha-5, it failed to affect the minds of the GOC operators, who immediately began attacking GoI-120 members not absorbed by SCP-PL-259.

* **12:35, 06.09.1949** -- The Alpha-5 operator manages to sever the remaining limbs of the gigantic mass, then, destroying the iron shell around the chest, pull SCP-PL-259 out of the center and throw him towards the hill.

* **12:40, 06.09.1949** -- Thaumaturgic circles are corrected and SCP-PL-259 is locked in iron. The previous mass of SCP-PL-259-2 disintegrates, leaving behind uncoordinated forces of the Third Empire. Foundation and GOC forces are on the offensive again.

* **13:20, 06.09.1949** -- Final defeat of the last survivors from the Third Fae Empire.

------

**SUMMARY:** SCP-PL-259 has been contained and the threat from the Third Fae Empire has been neutralized with acceptable casualties. Three GoI-120 members fled the battlefield to the Republic of China, but were caught in January 1950 by Foundation agents in the People&#39;s Republic of China.

**__EVENT SUMMARY:__** 13 members of the local GoI-120 cell at the Free Port of Esterberg were detained. Foundation investigation revealed that they attempted to summon SCP-PL-259 from the dead, using runes purportedly supposed to originate from the Second Fae Empire.

In fact, badly prescribed runes from the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogd_Khan Bogd Khan seal] were used, which were placed on a Mongolian decorative souvenir made in 1999. GoI-120 with the help of these runes summoned Bogd Khan from the dead, who, after finding out where he was, simply left the hiding place of GoI-120. He was found 10 hours later by Foundation agents dead in a brothel with a high blood alcohol content.
