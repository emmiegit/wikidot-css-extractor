++++ **__Special Containment Procedures__**
SCP-5202 is held within Site-51&#39;s Underground Item Storage Vault-3. The vault has been fitted with a Lexon-Anderson Vacuum Array (LAVA), to ensure 100% auditory cancelation. 

If the LAVA experiences a loss of power or mechanical malfunction, all personnel on Site-51&#39;s sublevels one through six are to wear Class-2a auditory protection headsets until containment is reestablished.

The Site-51 PoI Apprehension Unit is to continue tracking PoI-5202/A and PoI-5202/B to facilitate their capture.
[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;addenda-header&#34;]]
++++ **__Description__**
SCP-5202 is a synthetic fowl imitation prop enhanced by a continuous audiothurgic process, housed within its internal acoustic device. This process amplifies SCP-5202&#39;s auditory function to 170-190 decibels. SCP-5202 is highly damage resistant and there is currently no known method of deactivating it.
[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;addenda-header&#34;]]
++++ **__Discovery__**
SCP-5202 came to Foundation attention when assets in the Ohio State Police reported a strange auditory phenomenon affecting the town of Cadbern. Civilians filed several noise complaints regarding a loud &#34;croaking noise&#34; that could be heard for miles. Local residence believed the sound originated from the Duepur Corporation&#39;s[[footnote]] A nationwide manufacturer and distributor of poultry meat products.[[/footnote]] headquarters, located 3.2 km West of Cadbern. The OSP assets forwarded an audio file of the event, background noise has been removed for clarity:

The following day, the Foundation intercepted a Hallmark apology card addressed to the Duepur headquarters. The card was signed by a Peter Winship (designated PoI-5202/A) and included the handwritten message &#34;I never meant for this to happen, I&#39;m so sorry.&#34;

An investigation of PoI-5202/A&#39;s home led to the discovery of the following messages regarding SCP-5202, found on his personal computer.

Yo – did the thing, how does this look:

&gt; **Title:** The Alarm Cluck
&gt; 
&gt; **Materials Requirements:** 
&gt; 
&gt; * A Lord-o-Laugh® brand Rubber Chicken
&gt; * Two Audiomancers
&gt; * 10 grams of calcified banshee dust
&gt; * .23 litres of diluted phoenix blood
&gt; * A 20cm by 20cm by 20cm cardboard box
&gt; * $3.68 for postage
&gt; 
&gt; **Abstract:**
&gt; 
&gt; //The Alarm Cluck// is a thaumaturgically enhanced rubber chicken that, upon activation by squeezing, will produce a continuous loop of chicken sounds. The rubber chicken itself has undergone two enhancements:
&gt; * Fireproofing via application of diluted phoenix blood. (In order to prevent heat related malfunctions.)
&gt; * A self-contained acoustic vortex within the chickens &#34;voicebox&#34;, using the banshee dust as a catalyst.
&gt; The acoustic vortex has been set to continuously loop the pre-recorded chicken sounds at 80 dB, for a week.
&gt; 
&gt; The rubber chicken will be placed in a cardboard box and shipped to its intended destination by the US Postal Service. The final display location will be the Duepur Corporation&#39;s national headquarters on June 1st, 2020.
&gt; 
&gt; **Intent:**
&gt; 
&gt; We recently watched the documentary &#34;Cluck You!&#34;, which showed us the fucked manner in which the American poultry industry handles business. As lovers of all animals, we were shocked and disgusted at the acts carried out by the &#34;top-dogs&#34; of the industry. No one&#39;s more guilty than the biggest name in the game– Duepur. They pack these poor creatures into warehouses, living beak to beak in their own filth. Disease, disfigurement, accelerated growth– the conditions these chickens live through are something we wouldn&#39;t wish on our worst enemies. We have no issues with people eating meat, but there&#39;s a better way to do it than this. There has to be.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe up there at headquarters, the big wigs can&#39;t hear the chickens&#39; screams for mercy, but they&#39;re sure as shit gonna hear this and maybe they&#39;ll wake the fuck up.
