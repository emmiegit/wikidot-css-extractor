&gt; **Sloth&#39;s Pit, Wisconsin Anomalous Incidents Records**
&gt; **911 Call made on 18/10/2017 from the Pyramid Inn, Sloth&#39;s Pit, Wisconsin to Douglas County Dispatch**
&gt; **Begin Transcript**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dispatch:** Douglas County 911, do you require police, fire or ambulance?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI:** I-I-I don&#39;t know.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dispatch:** What&#39;s happening, madam?
&gt; 
&gt; [Several seconds of shaky breathing]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dispatch:** Hello?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI:** I&#39;m... I&#39;m at the Pyramid Inn on Talon Street, by the edge of town in Sloth&#39;s Pit? I can&#39;t get out of my room.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dispatch:** Are you trapped in your room, ma&#39;am? Is someone keeping you there?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI:** No, I... every time I go out of my room and open a door-- any door, the elevator, the door to the stairs, it just... I end up back in my room, and I don&#39;t know how!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dispatch:** Ma&#39;am, I&#39;m going to be transferring your call now. There are people trained for this situation specifically.
&gt; 
&gt; **POI:** Okay.
&gt; 
&gt; [Several seconds of silence, with shaky breathing, as the phone call transfers. Analysis of the call indicates that there is a slight sloshing sound in the background, as if water is being splashed in a bathtub or sink.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Nina Weiss:** Director Weiss&#39;s Office, to whom am I speaking?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI:** Director? [Pauses] The police said that I was going to be transferred to someone wh-who could help me. I&#39;m at the Pyramid Inn on Talon Avenue, and I can&#39;t leave my room.
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Weiss:** [inhaling sharply] Okay. What&#39;s your name?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI:** Martha. My name&#39;s Martha. I&#39;m in... room thirteen, on the third floor, and every time I leave m-m-my room, [incoherent speech] back to it! I can&#39;t get in the elevator, I can&#39;t get into any other room, every time I open any door, I end up in my room! [soft sobbing]
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Weiss:**  Room thirteen? [Pauses] Are you positive?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI:** Y-yes, Ma&#39;am, miss Weiss.
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Weiss:**  There is no room thirteen on any floor of the Pyramid.
&gt; 
&gt; **POI:** What? Oh god.
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Weiss:**  We&#39;ve been having trouble there a while now. I&#39;m afraid you may have been caught up in something strange, Martha. [sounds of footsteps; likely Director Weiss pacing] Don&#39;t panic. Has anything in your room changed on your returns to it?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI:** Uh, um. The TV&#39;s been on a few times, it&#39;s... it&#39;s been playing speeches by Reagan.
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Weiss:**  What kind of speeches?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI:** Uh, I don&#39;t know. It was... I think it was his inauguration? Don&#39;t know why it&#39;d play that. I tried changing the channels, and all of them are on programs from the 1980s. What the hell, what the hell, what the hell... 
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Weiss:**  Okay, so it&#39;s not Cut Up While Talking. Anything else?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI:** I, uh, um. Shit, I think that there&#39;s a... my luggage has moved. It was on my bed, I was packing up, and then it was on the floor after I came back.
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Weiss:** Is everything in your luggage, Martha?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI:** Uh... I&#39;ll check.
&gt; 
&gt; [A soft tap is heard as the phone is put down on a surface, followed by the sound of clothing being rummaged through. Several seconds later, a loud scream is heard on the line, and the phone is knocked to the floor, where it is picked up by the POI, who is incoherent for several seconds]
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Weiss:**  Martha? What&#39;s wrong, what happened?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI:** [sobbing loudly] HOLY SHIT HOLY FUCKING //SHIT WHAT THE FUCK?!//
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Weiss:** Please, calm down. I-I need you to tell me what happened.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **POI:** Th-th-there&#39;s a goddamn hand in my luggage! I looked through it, and it reached out and g-grabbed me! Oh god, what the fuck. [sobbing] I-I have burn marks on my arm! It burned me! It grabbed my arm and burned me!
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Weiss:**  Martha, I&#39;m going to need you to stay calm. I&#39;m going to go off the phone for a little bit. A team will arrive at your location soon, all right?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI:** ...all right. Thank you, Nina.
&gt; 
&gt; [Director Weiss places their receiver down, and opens a communication channel with the commander of MTF-Sigma-10]
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Weiss:** Sigma-10, we need a squad scrambled at the Pyramid Inn, we have a Code Vorhees, repeat, Code Vorhees. Civilian is trapped inside a triskaidekic anomaly on the third floor, spectral activity highly possible.
&gt; 
&gt; **S10 Command:** Copy that, Director. Squad nine is in the area, we&#39;ll have them dispatched immediately.
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Weiss:** Thank you. 
&gt; 
&gt; [Director Weiss retrieves their receiver]
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Weiss:** Martha, we&#39;re coming to get you out.
&gt; 
&gt; **POI:** Thank you, thank you. God, I&#39;m hungry. I&#39;ve been stuck here all morning.
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Weiss:** The Pyramid usually has some snacks in the mini-fridge.
&gt; 
&gt; **POI:** Okay. 
&gt; 
&gt; [Silence, and then a loud growl, followed by a scream and loud, clattering sounds, presumably the receiver being fumbled with]
&gt; 
&gt; **POI:** FUCK! The Mini-fridge tried to bite me!
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Weiss:** Are you hurt?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI:** No, no. It grazed me. I&#39;m... I&#39;ve climbed up onto the table, now.
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Weiss:** Don&#39;t you have a cell phone?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI:** No, I don&#39;t. What&#39;s-- [several foosteps are heard in the background of the call] wait, I think I hear them.
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Weiss:** [Addressing Sigma-10 Leader] Sigma-10-9, command. Can you confirm you&#39;re in the Pyramid?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **S10L:** Confirmed, Director. We&#39;re standing near where we think the anomalous aperture is. Ready to infiltrate.
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Weiss:** They&#39;re coming in for you, Martha. Don&#39;t worry.
&gt; 
&gt; **POI:** Thank you, Nina. I&#39;m so hungry. Thank you.
&gt; 
&gt; [Several second pause, and a click, indicating Director Weiss is in the process of placing down their receiver, before they suddenly retrieve it.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Weiss:**  I never gave you my first name, Martha.
&gt; 
&gt; **POI:** [laughing] You don&#39;t have to. You&#39;ve stayed here before. I know the names of everyone who&#39;s stayed at the Pyramid. [A sound of rushing wind is heard, along with the breaking down of a wall as Sigma-10-9 infiltrates the space the POI occupies.] I&#39;m so hungry. I think I&#39;ll have some breakfast.
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Weiss:** What-- [the connection between Director Weiss and the POI is terminated.] Oh god. Oh my god. [Director Weiss, panicked, addresses Sigma-10 Command] Sigma-10, recall Squad 9 immediately! Recall them! Now!
&gt; 
&gt; **S10 Command:** You&#39;re breaking up, director.
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Weiss:** RECALL SQUAD NINE NOW! THEY ARE IN IMMINENT DANGER! WE HAVE BEEN STUNG!
&gt; 
&gt; [Sigma-10-9&#39;s comms start emitting sounds of combat; gunfire, unidentified snapping sounds, loud gurgling, and several screams, before several seconds of silence]
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Weiss:** Sigma-10-9? 
&gt; 
&gt; [S10-9L&#39;s comms respond to Director Weiss. S10-9L is not speaking.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Unknown Entity:** Thanks for the room service, Nina. It&#39;s far easier than ordering take-out.
&gt; 
&gt; 

Life sign monitors of all Sigma-10-9 agents indicate that all members of the task force are still alive, but experiencing heightened heart rate and adrenaline levels, consistent with a fear response.
