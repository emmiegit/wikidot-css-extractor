//&#34;They&#39;re magic men,&#34; father says. He lifts his cane and levies it as he rocks the chair backwards, dark face looking down at little Charlie. The child regards his father and then peers at the golden talisman glinting in his tiny palms. &#34;That necklace you&#39;re holding,&#34; father grunts, leaning down in his seat to match Charlie&#39;s height and pointing to the amulet&#39;s exquisite detail, &#34;they said they&#39;re imbued with a mystic power. One that only they and their knights could summon. They controlled it with their minds, Charlie. Because it was their minds, their thoughts, that sparked its power.&#34;//

//&#34;Chaos magic,&#34; Charlie says.//

//&#34;That&#39;s right!&#34; Father lets loose a hearty guffaw. &#34;Oh, but don&#39;t say that in front of mommy, alright? She&#39;ll kill me.&#34;//

//&#34;Why can&#39;t I?&#34;//

//&#34;She&#39;s scared of magic.&#34; Father frowns. &#34;Rightly. We ought to be scared as well. The rest of my friends were so scared that, hundreds of years ago, they created the Foundation. It was the wisest decision they ever made.&#34;//

//Charlie holds the talisman and feels its weight and his fingers graze over its intricacies. &#34;Will I ever meet them?&#34; he says.//

//Father is quiet.//

//&#34;The magic men?&#34; Charlie says.//

//Father looks deep into his son&#39;s eyes and he does not speak.//

It was once magical. On its dark shawl the First Thirteen made their asylum. Now see the mahogany halls and the banners crestfallen. In truth it is Director Gears&#39; first time seeing the abode of his learned superiors. Manchester House it is called: Site-1. The Director is alone and forward the dark path lies. 

He was without notice to the Dragonfly&#39;s burial. The Moth only later informed him after he&#39;d been given their summons. If he had not labored for this calling then he had died long before. It is not candlelight that flickers, instead some dull electric approximate, yet Gears is drawn in teutonic light nonetheless. The place is quiet. 

The Council rises. They are veiled in dark frontispiece ornamented and varied and all around hum the lightfixtures. Their roundtable is no match for the officespace chamber he finds himself in. Things gutted with age adorn the many corners. 

&#34;Now begins the meeting,&#34; says the Moth. Gears hears the click of a tape recorder somewhere else removed. &#34;The Foundation Council of Overseers welcomes Director Charles Gears to the table. We mourn the death of our Seventh Chairholder, and may his spirit be venerated; we duly congratulate Director Gears for reaching us in this unfortunate time. Our Seventh shall be remembered, and though their image has been cast into obscurity, they shall live on immortal in the beating heart of our Foundation.&#34;

The Moth regards Gears. Pointed eyes studying the Director&#39;s frail frame he can feel sifting under its veil. &#34;Charles Ogden Gears,&#34; it thunders, &#34;you are, and you have lasted, as a loyal doctor of the Foundation. Your teachings and your service on this day shall be recognized. Once you were my student. In my past life, I watched you with great interest. It delights me to see that you have proven my suspicion correct: you are a fine practitioner indeed, and we Overseers will take this time to properly congratulate you for your achievements.&#34;

The Councilmen applaud. The Director&#39;s face is stone. 

&#34;Thank you,&#34; Dr. Gears nods. &#34;Likewise to you all. It is an honor to be seated here.&#34;

The Centipede tents its slender fingers like a small birchtree tipi. The Tarantula&#39;s great stomach inflates like some horrible toad&#39;s bulbous gull. The rest perch malevolent and dissociate and removed, these black storks scrying sagely at the Director from the waterline. 

&#34;Would it not be appropriate for me to be veiled as well?&#34; Gears says.

&#34;That does not matter,&#34; the Moth says. &#34;It won&#39;t matter once your promotion comes to pass. Think of this as a symbolic gesture. A formality. Once, we were all doctors of the Foundation, and indeed those parts of ourselves may yet elsewhere live on, but now we have surrendered those persons for the sake of our Foundation.&#34;

&#34;I am not worried. Truthfully, I was merely confused as to the implications of my presence here.&#34;

&#34;Director,&#34; the Moth mulls, &#34;you&#39;re here at the request of the late O5-7. He chose you to take his place. He, along with this Council, have selected you as the ideal candidate for the position of Overseer.&#34;

Director Gears closes his eyes and nods. &#34;I understand.&#34; His head swerves to the Councilmen one by one. &#34;This entails the conclusion of my present identity, I presume?&#34;

The Moth nods.

&#34;I see. For the sake of my promotion, I am fully willing to do so; but understand, sir Overseers, that I would not wish any undue distress to my friends regarding the circumstances of my disappearance. What do you plan for Charles Gears once I become Overseer?&#34;

&#34;Noble,&#34; the Bloatfly says. &#34;He will die. You can choose where you&#39;ll be buried. I get where you&#39;re coming from, Director, but unfortunately there&#39;s no easy way to let your peers know that Dr. Gears is gone.&#34;

&#34;They can&#39;t know,&#34; states the Scorpion. &#34;That&#39;s the only thing: none of the people who once knew you can know. It&#39;s hard, but it&#39;s for the good of our security. I&#39;m sorry.&#34;

&#34;You have no need to apologize, sir Overseer. I am only worried inasmuch as the passage of this message to my peers is concerned.&#34; 

The Millipede shifts its weight. &#34;All things come to pass.&#34; It chews on a wooden pipe unlit, the precipice of its nozzle teethed and worn. His jaw jitters like some chihuahua dog. &#34;Naturally, you understand.&#34;

&#34;It was hard for me too,&#34; the Scorpion says.

&#34;Indeed,&#34; echoes the Moth. 

&#34;All that aside, Director, allow me to address the forthcoming reality of your living circumstances,&#34; the Wasp says. It smiles first: &#34;First, I should address the Site-1 myth. You won&#39;t be living here. None of us do.&#34;

&#34;I am aware.&#34;

The Wasp&#39;s grin remains and stagnates for a quarter minute more before it pales. It produces a sheath of papers and taps it on the roundtable and lays them down flat and slides them to Gears. He looks them over. 

&#34;You will be relocated,&#34; the Wasp says. &#34;All information regarding your location and status will hereby be classified under Level 5 clearance. You will be assigned a private task force of twenty men to ensure your safety at all times. You won&#39;t notice them, doctor; they&#39;ll be out of your way, like ghosts. You can tend to your projects in peace.&#34;

&#34;Thank you, sir.&#34;

The Council hums in affirmation. All of them smiling, all except for Gears: he shifts through the papers one by one, erring a careful eye on their contents, and signs them each. Gears finishes, sliding the documents out in front of him. The eye of the Council studies him. &#34;The papers have been signed,&#34; he says. &#34;Is there anything else that you require of me?&#34;

The Moth grins. &#34;Let me describe your future to you, Overseer.&#34;

----

Gears researched them in secret, the Council. He crouched at his study and followed trails that led him to the Green Mountains. The original Foundation; the New Connecticut Temple Cavalry, the knight-rangers perched errant at their fires atop the mountains, crouched in the halfdark of the woods. Scant few of their stories remain. The proclamation of the Veil Initiative, a philosophy penned and distributed by French magicians, carried to New England by third parties, fur traders, farmers, who gathered at the first Site during the first O5 Council and created the first Foundation. When was it that they gathered, that the first doctors of the Foundation rose to the pulpit; what queer containment procedures had they devised for the things they recalled in grim remove over scullery flames and under the trees. 

The knowledge was classified, or lost. The paper trail wore thin around the great peaks. The documentation is scant. Anything more would be too revealing.

The parkinglot Gears steps into is stark, and he feels naked where unauthorized eyes could clearly spy him. The Councilmen exit the armored vans. Blank faces. Pale faces. Though their veils are removed Gears is remiss as to their features. Men of the Foundation in full public view, Alpha-1 bodyguards dressed slack and casual and anonymous. They looked like a troupe of midnight hikers. Something about it, the exposure, the voyeurism, twisted Gears&#39; gut. 

Up the mountain they go, to the amphitheater left by the predecessors. Their agents carry cases draped in black cloth and firearms shrouded by wear. The wind blows right through. It tunes the Director like a whistle, his wiry frame wavering up the trail. The wind surges and pales through their skin and carries the scent of rainwashed soil over them. Gears clutches his coat close. 

Before these trees were men unmade and the most valiant of them ordained. He sees their fires in his head through the leaves. The philanthropy of the Masonic Temple sent militias through the original settlements of Vermont to capture the magical things they&#39;d heard tell of over the fire. The first containment operations, then rituals, were conducted in the forts and the lodges. Other men picked up in their stead: in New York, Quebec, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, regardless they reported their findings to the First Council. 

All that remains are campfire stories. The only concrete records are whispers. The Overseers are satisfied with their mystery, this legend of the Green Mountain rangers, and leave it at that. Perhaps Gears could look forward to further research following his promotion.

The final step. A wooden beam. Gears remains a straight signpost in the wind though his breath his ragged. Ahead of him the Wasp turns to regard him. It has eyes like a fox. It reaches out to him, and Gears hesitates. The Wasp grins. Gears brushes past. Alpha-1 in the trees, setting a glass perimeter around the procession. The amphitheater is reduced to its barest components; a stone hoop in the grass, a basin like a bowl on the mountaintop, like the lips of a volcano, masonic pews carved in the lid. The Moth ushers ahead and the Wasp accompanies it as they set a foldable desk at the center. Three guards set the black cases on a stone seal in the ground before turning back and vanishing. The Moth, a jittering old man, hobbles to them and kneels and clicks them open with shivering fingers. 

They have garbs. The Antlion hands him one. Its own garb hangs on its skeletal figure like a willow. Gears fastens the apron to his waist, a convenient belt buckle on the back. On its face the seal of the Foundation looks curiously outward and surrounds itself with symbology unknown even to Gears. The Moth takes a bronze scepter from the box. In its other hand a longknife. 

The Moth speaks. The indentured men of the Foundation Temple are gathered here tonight to observe the designation of a young Councilman. We gather here under the watch of the Supreme Architect of the Universe, Lighter of the Way, and we perform in respect to His initiative. We promise and swear that under the Architect we will perform our daily duty, and furthermore we promise and swear that we shall support the Constitution of the General Founding Principle Charter of the Veil Initiative, and that we hope to rightly entrust Charles Ogden Gears, our fellow apprentice, to the mantle of Foundation Overseer. Audi, vide, tace.

Audi, vide, tace.

The old man smacks his lips. Their eyes are darkened. So come forth, says he, Charles Ogden Gears, inheritor of the Seventh Chair of the Foundation Council of Overseers. And Director Gears goes forth. 

Kneel to me.

He kneels so. The Moth raises the sword over his head and lowers it unto his shoulders and it is all read under the stars.

You are an honest man. The Council has found you to be of the utmost upstanding moral character, and your doctoral procedures we have found to be satisfying to our means. In your own devices you are a valuable asset to the Initiative, a loyal practitioner of parascience, and a light in the darkness we face. On this day you are recognized.

They were myriad. They surged against the darkening of the world, so he was told; they raged against the madness, brought light to the abominations, and concealed them so the grace of the Architect may be preserved. A million dead souls in containment, a billion practitioners orating in darkness. Reclaim the fire, father said: stoke it. Into your hands it is committed, just as we are committed into the Architect&#39;s body and soul. Secure, contain, and protect. 

It is our duty.

&#34;I swear,&#34; he says.

The Moth raises the sword and its blade waxes in the light of the moon, a pale mirror, and it carries the snout down to its feet. The Wasp approaches Gears and again reaches out to him. Gears regards the creature before him. Gears hesitates before taking the Wasp&#39;s hand. 

The Dragonfly rises.

----

//Father speaks.//

//&#34;When you grow up, Charles.&#34;//

//He runs a chalky hands through the child&#39;s hair. Charlie giggles. His nose is red. Emmanuel Gears laps in the sight of his one and only sun squat and cheeryeyed and abask in the light of the fireplace. He sees him like the treasure he is.//

//&#34;When you grow up, you&#39;ll understand.&#34;//
