I paused for a moment, but then I started to stand up. The screech of the chair sliding across the cement floor echos throughout the empty, dark room. My legs feel weak as I grab onto the table for balance. Taking a deep breath, I pushed in the chair and started to walk towards the door. 

I feel my weak hands grasp the handle to pull it open, but I stop, glancing back at the lockbox once more. 

//Never again...//

I look away, opening and closing the door behind me as it clicks shut forever.

I can hear my shoes echo throughout the corridor as my vision becomes blurry with tears. I was stupid to come here. I risked my entire life for what? 

Who am I kidding... this isn&#39;t a life. I never asked for this. All I want is to be able to have a family. To have kids. To see real people. I don&#39;t want to live in darkness. 

I stop walking.

Hearing the sounds of boots thumping against the ground, I turn around, seeing a group of security personnel walk towards me. My heart drops as I keep walking forward to the elevator door. Why would they be after me? I didn&#39;t use the instance. No, this can&#39;t be it; this has to be a mistake in judgment. The elevator doors near closer as I hurry up my pace.

I press the up button on the elevator and close my eyes, praying they won&#39;t be able to reach me in time. Come on, you cheap piece of shit, come down already.

The doors prop open as I hurry inside and repeatedly press the lobby button. 

&#34;Hold the elevator,&#34; one of the guard&#39;s yells as they wave a hand towards me, &#34;We&#39;ll be there in just a second!&#34;

&#34;Sorry,&#34; I say loudly, the metal doors slowly encasing me, &#34;No room! Just take the next one!&#34;

&#34;Asshole,&#34; the officer grunts as the doors close with a thump.

I can feel my heart pound in my chest as I take in a deep breath of relief. I&#39;m... ok. I look down, seeing my unbuttoned, wet dress shirt. I should at least button it up before I get to the lobby floor. One by one, I button it up and look at my distorted reflection in the metal elevator door. I&#39;ve been worse.  

The elevator door opens as the breeze of cold air and the smell of coffee greet me. The sound of chatter and the ring of phones overcome the whirring of the elevator fan as I exit and look at the large door on the other side of the room.

If it weren&#39;t for the fact that we are working for the most secret and secure organization on the planet, it would seem like an ordinary office lobby. Men sitting down on comfy chairs reading the daily newspaper, the young receptionist taking calls with an annoyed expression, and the interns rushing to their boss&#39;s office with carts of coffee in hand. 

It&#39;s peaceful up here.

I grab the handle and open the door, immediately feeling the snow wrap itself across my face. I close the door behind me, taking a deep breath of cold air as it dries up my throat. I look up, seeing dark and ominous clouds, but behind them stars with varied constellations sprinkled along a black canvas. The snow falls vertically, horizontally, or even both, but all falling faintly in their last moments of descent. Although their journey is over, they will be remembered, packed along the ground that changed the landscape from something barren and dead to something beautiful.
