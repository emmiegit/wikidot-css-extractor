**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7229 is to be monitored at all times by a team of astrophysicists stationed at Area-08-C. Any changes in ##4f7ce3|**time dilation surrounding the Earth**## are to be recorded and analyzed immediately. ##4f7ce3|**All previous data related to SCP-7229 is to be classified as Level 4 or above and kept strictly confidential effective immediately. Any unauthorized disclosure of information related to SCP-7229 will be met with severe consequences**##

##4f7ce3|**Any civilian individuals who disappear during the 4-day period of SCP-7229&#39;s effect are to be immediately reported to Foundation personnel for investigation, and cover stories are to be disseminated to the public to explain the disappearance of influential figures. Individuals who have observed disappearances are to be administered Class-B amnestics. Due to the potential for SCP-7229 to affect Foundation personnel, all essential personnel are to remain on-site during SCP-7229, unless authorized by at least two Level 4 personnel.**##

To mitigate the effects of SCP-7229, the Foundation has implemented a series of countermeasures. These include the use of highly advanced ##4f7ce3|**temporal anchors strategically placed across the Earth which emit a continuous stream of temporal energy in an attempt to stabilize the flow of time**## as well as the deployment of a network of sensors ##4f7ce3|**which have been launched into orbit**## to detect any changes in the Earth&#39;s ##4f7ce3|**local time-space continuum. Additionally, the Foundation has attempted to disrupt the anomaly by limiting travel and movement during SCP-7229 in specific regions, but this has so far been unsuccessful. Efforts are currently underway to identify any patterns or characteristics among those who have disappeared during previous instances of the anomaly in order to determine whether SCP-7229 is targeting specific groups or individuals.**##

Following the discovery of the correlation between SCP-7229 and ##4f7ce3|**an increased rate of global disappearances,**##  the Foundation has concluded that immediate ##4f7ce3|**urgent**## action is required to ##4f7ce3|**counteract**## the effects of SCP-7229. Due to the public being aware of the need for leap years to adjust for a slightly longer year, the Foundation has been obscuring the true reason for the need for leap years and maintaining the status quo of public knowledge to prevent any potential social disruption via containing the knowledge of its existence. Efforts have also been made to ensure that all historical records and scientific literature on the topic of leap years are consistent with the misinformation campaign. 

In the event that SCP-7229&#39;s effects become noticeable to the general public, a cover story must be disseminated to explain the changes in the Earth&#39;s ##4f7ce3|**orbit**## and a new explanation for leap years must be devised.

**Description:** SCP-7229 is ##4f7ce3|**a temporal**## anomalous phenomenon that ##4f7ce3|**occurs in the month of February and**## affects ##4f7ce3|**time dilation around the earth.**## SCP-7229 appears to cause a significant temporary periodic fluctuation ##4f7ce3|**on the passage of time surrounding the Earth,**## resulting in a ##4f7ce3|**perceived**## slowdown of the Earth&#39;s orbital velocity that lasts for approximately 4 days and occurs on a 4-year cycle. The cause of SCP-7229 is currently unknown. Attempts to detect any underlying patterns or correlations with other celestial events have been inconclusive. 

During the period of ##4f7ce3|**increased time dilation**## caused by SCP-7229, ##4f7ce3|**reported disappearances increase by at least 2500%. SCP-7229 is believed to be responsible for the disappearance of at least 5700 individuals each cycle and counting.**##

##4f7ce3|**Witnesses to the disappearances describe seeing individuals being taken away by an unknown entity (denominated SCP-7229-2) but no physical evidence of this creature has been recovered. Despite numerous attempts, the Foundation has been unable to locate SCP-7229-2 or determine the true source of the anomaly.**## SCP-7229 has also caused anomalies in the Earth&#39;s magnetic field, resulting in disruptions to communication and navigation systems. Despite the relatively short duration of the effect, ##4f7ce3|**due to the significant threat to global security**## the Foundation has established several research initiatives ##4f7ce3|**and studies of theoretical physics and quantum mechanics.**## The data collected from these studies will aid in ##4f7ce3|**preventing**## fluctuations in ##4f7ce3|**time dilation**## and ##4f7ce3|**developing**## effective strategies to ##4f7ce3|**neutralize**## the effects of SCP-7229.
