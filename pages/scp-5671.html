**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5671 is currently contained at Site-300-14, at the 13^^th^^ Biohazard Chamber. No individual is to be in contact with the object without written permission from the Site Director. All personnel within the vicinity of SCP-5671 must wear protective suits, which may not be removed under any circumstances. Any staff member suspected to be infected with SCP-5671-2 are to be quarantined, until infection can be confirmed, before being moved into proper containment. 

SCP-5671-1 instances are currently kept under isolated containment, within biohazard cells. All cells must be checked periodically for any damage. Weekly interviews have been approved for assessment for the mental state of the subjects, however personnel are not allowed direct contact with the subjects under any circumstances. 

SCP-5671-2 instances are contained in similar biohazard cells, however all observation windows are to be made from Ippo glass at least 7 inches thick. No glass is to be used in major areas of the cells. Deceased instances are stored at Sector 15 for study. No personnel are to be allowed any contact with the anomalies.

**Containment Memorandum:** File pending update following Incident  Incident 26-12-22. Dr. Nomal A. Writer has replaced Dr. Gooday as research head. The locating and detainment of uncontained instances is a considered a high priority. Additional resources have been provided to [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-300| Site-300]]].

**Description:** SCP-5671 is an object resembling a chrysalis, roughly 15 meters in height and 17 meters in width. SCP-5671 is extremely resilient, with incendiary and penetrating instruments being ineffective on it. The anomaly regularly releases large amounts of purple vapor into the surrounding area. DNA analysis of the anomaly has concluded it matches with that of Janik Waelts, a known agent of GOI-051 (&#34;The Chaos Insurgency&#34;). When the vapor is inhaled by a living human subject, henceforth referred to as SCP-5671-1, it will result in the formation of SCP-5671-2 instances within their body, typically inside their lungs or stomach. This does not appear to cause discomfort to the host. 

[[include component:image-block name=http://waltz-sandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/machenfly/paladin.png | caption=An SCP-5671-2A instance. | align=right]]

SCP-5671-2 are insectoid organisms formed from an SCP-5671-1 subject&#39;s extracted cells. The organisms bear resemblance to the common cruiser butterfly (//Vindula arsinoe//), but are far more adaptive and stronger.[[footnote]] One instance was able to bite through a steel rod.[[/footnote]] These instances upon formation[[footnote]]Usually within 1 or 2 hours of inhalation of the vapor. [[/footnote]] are divided into two groups. SCP-5671-2B instances are the ones that will remain inside SCP-5671-1, and exert further infection upon the host. SCP-5671-2A are the instances that exit the host&#39;s body, typically through their mouth or nostrils. While this causes mild discomfort, this does seem not harm or kill the host.

Upon exiting, SCP-5671-2A will seek out and attempt to enter and infect the body of the closest living human being. Entry is usually obtained by forcefully biting[[footnote]]SCP-5671-2A instances are carnivorous and have sharp incisors.[[/footnote]] a hole into the skin or through the nostrils of the subject. The process of infection is similar in both -2A and -2B instances; they will partially fuse with the body of the subject, severely damaging large amounts of the subject&#39;s nerves. 

The SCP-5671-2 instances will then proceed to release a large amount of a thick purple substance[[footnote]] Currently classified as RS23, a mutated strain of Dr. Cole Thereven&#39;s &#34;ROD&#34; serum.[[/footnote]] into the body of the host, usually targeted at the neural system. This severely alters the host&#39;s brain, with noted symptoms including increased aggression, increased detachment from reality, and increased health problems. 

Forcibly separating SCP-5671-2 from an SCP-5671-1 subject has almost always resulted in termination from cranial trauma inflicted by SCP-5671-2A. SCP-5671-1 instances obtain information about the existence of SCP-5671 even if they have no physical interaction with the anomaly itself. Over a varying period of time the SCP-5671-1 instances will begin to possess an obsession with SCP-5671.

All known SCP-5671-1 have attempted to &#34;serve&#34; SCP-5671, by acts such as creating artworks depicting the anomaly, poems about the anomaly, sacrificing animals or humans in the name of the anomaly, among other things. Many of the SCP-5671-1 have also attempted to breach containment of SCP-5671. Currently there are 34 instances of SCP-5671-1 in isolated containment, along with 56 instances of SCP-5671-2. The number of uncontained instances are unknown.

**Addendum 5671.01:** Discovery

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ ENTER CREDENTIALS TO ACCESS&#34; hide=&#34;- CLOSE FILE&#34;]]
SCP-5671 was indirectly created by the Foundation&#39;s [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dap-orientation Department of Atypical Persuasion], during an attempted interrogation of Janik Waelts, who previously had been the Site Director of Site-300-14, before being confirmed to be an undercover agent for GOI-051. In an attempt to make Waelts reveal more information on his mission, and against orders, the prototype &#34;ROD&#34; serum created by Dr. Thereven was used on the subject. 

After interrogation, the corpse of the CI Agent was disposed off at the Katkol lake,  where  SCP-5671 was located shortly afterwards. It is believed the experimental serum caused Janik Waelts to mutate into SCP-5671. Multiple individuals in nearby towns were confirmed to be infected with SCP-5671-2.

**Addendum 5671.02:** Interview 5671-1F.13

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ ENTER CREDENTIALS TO ACCESS&#34; hide=&#34;- CLOSE FILE&#34;]]

The following is a transcription of an interview of interest conducted with SCP-5671-1F, a subject infected with SCP-5671-2.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
* **INTERVIEWER**
 * Dr. Jack Gooday - a Class-II Reality Sink,[[footnote]] Capable of nullifying the effects of several potent anomalies.[[/footnote]] Research Lead on SCP-5671.
* **INTERVIEWEE**
 * SCP-5671-1F - a 6-year-old girl by the name of Calliope Gooday.

**FOREWORD:** While SCP-5671-1F was cooperative in the beginning, she soon refused to converse with any of the personnel. Due to Dr. Gooday&#39;s familiarity with her, he was sent in to interview her.
-------

**Dr. Gooday:** Good morning Callie.

= //No response.//

**Dr. Gooday:** How&#39;re you feeling?

= //No response.//

**Dr. Gooday:** Please say something. 

**SCP-5671-1F:** (//stuttering//) She-she says I shouldn&#39;t talk to you...

**Dr. Gooday:** Ah. (//pause//) I only want to help you...you know that, right?

**SCP-5671-1F:** (//sniffles//) I do! She-she doesn&#39;t want me talking to you. I don&#39;t want her to hurt me!

**Dr. Gooday:** Hey, hey-(//presses hand against the glass separating them//)-I know it hurts, but I need you to be strong, ok? Can you do that? 

= //SCP-5671-1F nods.//

**Dr. Gooday:** Alright. Could you tell me how &#34;she&#34; talks to you?

**SCP- 5671-1F:** She-she doesn&#39;t want me to say.

**Dr. Gooday:** Has she been talking to you for a while?

**SCP-5671-1F:** Y-Yes.

**Dr. Gooday:** I see. Don&#39;t listen to anything he says, alright? It&#39;s like that time you thought there was a monster living in our basement, remember? Was it real?

**SCP-5671-1F:** N-no.

**Dr. Gooday:** Exactly! She can&#39;t hurt you. (//pause//) So, how //are// you feeling today? 

**SCP-5671-1F:** Sick.

**Dr. Gooday:** More than before? 

//SCP-5671-1F nods, hugging her doll harder.//

**Dr. Gooday:** This has to end. This //has// to. (//pause//) You know how worried we&#39;ve been? Why did you just go off into the woods like that? Your mother almost had a heart attack!

**SCP-5671-1F:** (//begins crying//) I&#39;m s-sorry.

= //No response for 55 seconds//

**Dr. Gooday:** No-no, I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s not your fault. I&#39;m sorry I shouted at you, Callie. 

= //After a moment, SCP-5671-1F lets out a shriek.// 

**SCP-5671-1F:** It hurts.

**Dr. Gooday:** Where?

**SCP-5671-1F:** Everywhere!-(//begins clawing at her face//)

**Dr. Gooday:** That&#39;s only going to make it worse, you need to stop.

**SCP-5671-1F:** She&#39;s hurting me! She&#39;s hurting me, make her stop, please make her stop-

//SCP-5671-1F falls to the floor, screaming. There appears to be many small objects crawling under her skin. Dr. Gooday immediately alerts the staff and begins attempting to break into the cell, against orders.// 

//SCP-5671-1F begins coughing out blood, and multiple SCP-5671-2A instances, all of which swarm out and attack the glass window of the cell, which begins cracking. SCP-5671-1F&#39;s stomach ruptures as more SCP-5671-2A instances swarm out of it.//

//Personnel arrive and restrain Dr. Gooday. The situation is brought under control.//
-------
**Afterword:** Multiple SCP-5671-2A instances were captured and contained. However, SCP-5671-1F did not survive. Postmortem analysis revealed that the cause of death had been due to multiple SCP-5671-2B instances consuming several of her organs, causing severe internal bleeding. It was also revealed SCP-5671-1F had torn out her eyes and attempted to consume them.

**Addendum 5671.03:** Thaumiel Proposal

[[=]]
**Proposal To Reclassify SCP-5671 as Thaumiel**
[[size 81%]]Submitted by the **##orange|HEAD OF THE DAP##**[[/size]]
[[/=]]
Greetings to the Overwatch Command, Classification and Ethics Committees. You must be shocked at recieving this paper. Outraged, even. 

The Thereven ROD Serum was a prototype developed by the one and only Dr. Thereven to essentially dominate the minds of uncontainable, uncontrollable anomalies. &#34;Mind-control&#34;, colloquially speaking. It would also work in interrogations, such as converting enemy agents to our side, having them spy for us. 

The serum was faulty; the control was not complete, and mentally potent individuals could even resist the effects of it. There were also extreme side-effects, such many test subjects being rendered completely brain dead within a week or so, gross mutations (as seen with Mr. Waelts), along with a plethora of other things. 

It seems, however, nature itself has perfected it now.

Dr. Thereven, along with many of our other scientists, ran multitude of tests on the RS23 strain extracted from SCP-5671-2A, and found it was 98% more potent than the ROD serum, with 56% less toxicity, and its effects manifest 65% quicker. Dr. Thereven was able to refine the substance into RS23-α, a version made specifically for human subjects. 

RS23-α was a complete success; no individuals so far have shown the capability of resisting its effects. Granted, the process seems to be excruciating, most test subjects keep screaming for days before they are successfully converted. Utilizing it, we have successfully turned multiple agents from many Groups of Interest to our cause, they are completely and utterly subservient to us. Cole is already working on the β version for anomalies.

Some might call this unethical, entirely reprogramming the human mind, forcing them to be subject to your control, robbing them of free will. But its a //necessary// evil.

We propose the reclassify of SCP-5671 as Thaumiel-class. Without the anomaly, we will not be able to create more of this serum, which, we believe, is crucial for the future growth of the Foundation.

**Addendum 5671.04:** Incident 23-12-22

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ ENTER CREDENTIALS TO ACCESS&#34; hide=&#34;- CLOSE FILE&#34;]]

On December 23, SCP-5671 began pulsating, emitting a dim purple light. Approximately 50 seconds later, there was an increase in the amount of vapor which being released by it. During examination, it abruptly ejected a human individual from within, later identified to be Janik Waelts. 

Waelts was given the classification of SCP-5671-1Y, after it was noted that a large instance of SCP-5671-2B was inhabiting his chest cavity.

An interview with the subject has been provided below. 

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
* **INTERVIEWER**
 * Dr. Jack Gooday - A Class-II Reality Sink, Research Lead on SCP-5671.
* **INTERVIEWEE**
 * SCP-5671-1Y - Janik Waelts, agent for GOI-051.
--------

**SCP-5671-1Y:** Where-where am I?

**Dr. Gooday:** Hello, Janik. You are currently in solitary containment, how&#39;re you feeling? 

**SCP-5671-1Y:** Unwell. She has released me from her embrace.  

**Dr. Gooday:** ...it seems so. 

**SCP-5671-1Y:** (//touching his chest//) She wants one of her children to accompany me, I see. Five.

**Dr. Gooday:** What can you remember during your experience with...&#34;her&#34;?  

**SCP-5671-1Y:** Why, everything. She has set me on a mission. Release me immediately. 

**Dr. Gooday:** You are under-

**SCP-5671-1Y:** Release me immediately, five.

**Dr. Gooday:** Step away from the glass, sir. You will not be released until we see fit. 

= //Silence for 55 seconds.//

**SCP-5671-1Y:** What am I doing here?

= //Dr. Gooday remains silent, most likely confused.//

**SCP-5671-1Y:** (//hysterical//) You&#39;ve got to help me, please, let me out, let me out. Save me from hEric,  please! (//gasps//) She won&#39;t leave me alone...please, I have a family...

**Dr. Gooday:** We can help you, remain calm-

**SCP-5671-1Y:** (//starts making a gurgling noise//) Her children shall release me, then. (//pause//) I know you have her here. Release her as well, jailors.

**Dr. Gooday:** You&#39;ll have to clarify who &#34;she&#34; is.

**SCP-5671-1Y:** She is everything. She is the light that burns the sun, the oceans, the sky that stretches above us. She is the melody of the world, the painter of the world. You cannot imprison the world, five. 

**Dr. Gooday:** We are not imprisoning &#34;the world&#34; here. You are under the influence of a powerful hazardous anomaly, Janik.

**SCP-5671-1Y:** Are you sure about that?  

**Dr. Gooday:** We know it for a fact.

**SCP-5671-1Y:** You behold light in front of your eyes, yet you are too afraid to look at it. (//pause//) Perhaps we can make you see. Do not fear the light, five.

**Dr. Gooday:** Gibberish. Answer my questions seriously, or you will be put into enhanced interrogation. 

**SCP-5671-1Y:** You still fail to see it. Do what you want to me. She will free me eventually.

**Dr. Gooday:** No one is freeing you anytime soon.  

**SCP-5671-1Y:** (//laughing//) Five, do you really believe that?
[[/div]]

After this interview, Dr. Gooday submitted the following request.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
After spending countless months, days and seconds fretting over this thing, I have only been able to reach one conclusion: termination. 

The existence of this anomaly does nothing but pain those around it, it is an aberration. It twists and warps the minds of anyone under its influence, to an extreme degree. I have concluded that all the instances generated from it function as a hive mind, therefore, cutting off the head will most likely result in the termination/deactivation of all SCP-5671-2 instances. 

Our research into the anomaly has been revealing more and more worrying details, and has lead me to believe that termination is the only option. The SCP-5671-2 instances are //adapting//, they&#39;re becoming harder and harder to contain. And so is SCP-5671.

A butterfly always breaks free from its cocoon. 

Do we really want to be around when this one emerges?

We believe there is more to be learned from this anomaly. We cannot kill everything we contain. If this has been getting too stressful, please let us know.

**Addendum 5671.05:** Incident 26-12-22

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ ENTER CREDENTIALS TO ACCESS&#34; hide=&#34;- CLOSE FILE&#34;]]

On January 26, a widescale breach of containment at Site-300-14 occurred. Due to the relatively low priority and low resources given to Site-300-14, the situation could not be properly contained. A compiled transcription has been provided below.

The following transcription was written by Dr. Gooday. Due to his emotional state, the transcription may read as unprofessional and overtly detailed. Transcription pending rewrite.

//SCP-5671-1Y appears to be restless, pacing to-and-fro in his cell. He does this for 5 minutes, before stopping and lying down on his bed. 50 seconds pass without him moving. At 12:10, it is noted that something is seemingly writhing in SCP-5671-1Y&#39;s throat.//

//At 12:15, SCP-5671-1Y opens his mouth, and a swarm of many SCP-5671-2A instances are expelled from it, along with blood. The swarm begins attacking the glass observation window,  as well as the walls of the cell, which starts cracking.//

//An emergency is declared, MTF-Lambda-13 begin closing in on SCP-5671-1Y&#39;s containment cell. The glass shatters under the force of approximately 1,300 instances, which begin assaulting the task force.//

//The following occurred simultaneously and within 45 seconds://

//The swarm successfully breach the protective clothing of many of the task force members. L13-Alpha&#39;s head suddenly begins bulging and pulsating, and erupts, blood smearing the walls as the corpse falls down. L13-Beta screams, attempting to use the flamethrower, to no success, as most of the instances are unharmed.//

//The rest of the team attempt to use the flamethrowers on the swarm, to little success, even though they hit the target. L13-Lead&#39;s legs splinter apart with an audible crunching noise. L13-Delta shoots him in the head before her arms splinter apart.//

//L13-Gamma throws his ammunition to the floor, and begins clawing large strips of flesh out of their face. SCP-5671-2B instances can be seen wriggling in their wounds. L13-Gamma proceeds to slump to the floor and lay still.//

//L13-Sup&#39;s eyes  begin to bulge, and one instance can be seen moving in her left eye. She self-terminates using a nearby gun.//

//Both L13-Omicron and L13-Nu continue screaming and tearing at their faces for a duration of 45 seconds before abruptly stopping. L13-Omicron&#39;s right eye is completely torn into a mess, L13-Nu&#39;s mouth has been torn open to the cheeks, yet both of them are somehow still alive.//

//Two SCP-5671-2A instances flutter towards them, implanting themselves onto their eyes with an audible squishing noise. Blood along with RS23 begin oozing out as the instances nestle comfortably into their hollowed eye sockets, the wings still protruding outwards.//

//SCP-5671-1Y proceeds to step out of the containment cell, crushing an eye beneath his foot, as a Level 3 Emergency is declared, and walks down a hallway in the direction of the SCP-5671-1 containment wing. L13-Omicron and L13-Nu follow.//

//More reinforcements are called as SCP-5671-1Y proceeds to release SCP-5671-1 instances from containment. All of them begin following SCP-5671-1Y to the containment area for SCP-5671. Termination order for the instances approved.//

//More members of MTF-L-13 are sent to contain the breach. Efforts for a widescale recontainment is considered, a distress signal is sent to Central Command, with no response. 45 members of MTF-L-13 arrive to the location, and begin assaulting the instances with point blank gunfire., as well as the utilization  of incendiary weapons.  About 6 instances are terminated while the rest continue to move, despite suffering major wounds, even crawling.//

//MTF-L-13 is assaulted by SCP-5671-2A instances, the swarm believed to have grown to at least 3,000 instances. Their protective armour is breached almost immediately.//

//Approximately 2,345 instances begins rapidly taking the team apart, rank by rank. Members explode, spraying blood along with flesh everywhere. Many attempt to flee, but are also terminated, rank after rank, torn apart.//

//The bleeding, sloppy remains of the terminated personnel begin piling on the floor in a fashion similar to a wall. The surviving members undergo a process similar to L13-Omicron and Nu, they scream for 56 minutes, with SCP-5671-2B instances crawling into their wounds, before abruptly stopping and following SCP-5671-1Y.//

//It is unknown how they are still able to react to stimuli, as their eyes are believed to have been crushed and replaced by SCP-5671-2A instances. Blood and the viscous RS23 substance leak down their cheeks.//

//Emergency Lockdown of access to SCP-5671 is initiated, and the individuals present there are given the order to evacuate vicinity immediately. L13-Omicron overrides the lockdown, due to his credentials still being active.//

//The swarm of SCP-5671-2A as well as SCP-5671-1 barge into the area, as the last remaining researchers attempt to flee. L13-Nu, L13-Mu, L13-Zeta, and L13-Omicron proceed to fire at the researchers, incapacitating many of them.//

//Two SCP-5671-2A instances proceed to break into the protective suit of the primary senior researcher there. He attempts to swat it away, but the instances proceed to bite at his nose, tearing the nostrils 2 inches wider, before forcefully crawling in. The researcher begins screaming in pain.//  

//A similar process occurs with the other researchers present, the -2A instances implant themselves onto their eyes, the wings protruding outwards.//

//SCP-5671-1Y successfully breaks into the main chamber where SCP-5671 is kept. Many SCP-5671-1 instances lift the anomaly up, taking it out of the chamber.//

//A junior researcher present is on the floor in front of SCP-5671-1I. The individuals carrying the anomaly step beside, and all other instances, including the SCP-5671-2A, gather in a circle around the researcher. The following conversation was recorded://

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Junior Researcher:** (//static//)..please, let me go, I&#39;ll do anything.

**SCP-5671-1Y:** Anything? //Anything?// Would you perhaps consider opening your eyes?

**Junior Researcher:** My e-eyes are alre-already open.

**SCP-5671-1Y:** No, they are not. //Open them.//

//A loud shout can be heard, repeated five times.//

//Static, followed by incomprehensible noises, video glitches for a moment.//

**##purple|ERROR//56wEunknown:##** DO YOU SEE? DO YOU SEE NOW?

**Junior Researcher:** Yess...

//The junior researcher&#39;s eyes are covered by two protruding wings, blood streaking down her ceeks, mingling with a viscous purple liquid. She appears to be smiling.//

**SCP-5671-1Y:** Five, Mother is almost at this world.

//SCP-5671 suddenly begins glowing and pulsating with a purple light, which increases in brightness. Something large can be seen moving within it; a long moan is heard. It releases an overwhelming pulse of light, and the cameras cut out.//

Afterwards, no trace of SCP-5671 or its instances was found in the site, a widespread search is still continuing. The remains of the junior researcher, now identified to be Dr. Julia Trebor, were found at the chamber, her blood and pieces of her flesh smeared on the floor, spelling out the following message:
