This report is an in-depth review of the whereabouts of SCP objects [[[SCP-6118]]] and [[[SCP-7513]]] during the February 14th raid on Site-19 by GoI-003 ([[[Chaos Insurgency Hub|Chaos Insurgency]]]), as well as some background information about the incident. The location of the two missing SCP objects is considered a priority, as both are armed and are considered dangerous. This report was written by project heads Dr. Christian Abspoel and Dr. Jane Mitchell, under request from Site-13 director Catherine Ward and Site-19 director Tilda Moose.

**Background Information:** On 01/26/2023, GoI-7795 ([[[Greazeburger Incorporated Hub|Greazeburger Incorporated]]]) acquired a minor part located in Foundation-issued pagers. The following night, SCP-7513 was contacted by PoI-9883 (“Randolph Greaze”) and PoI-7795 (“Martin Greaze”) and was informed of the acquisition by PoI-9883. This incident was recorded as [[[Plus One|Incident 7513-97]]].

Following this incident, all Foundation pagers were recalled and replaced. However, shortly after, more Foundation assets were acquired by GoI-7795, including assets that made components for the xenorepellent transmitters located around Site-13. This resulted in a massive simultaneous failure of the xenorepellent transmitters. As a result, for safety purposes, SCP-7513 was temporarily transferred to Site-19 on 02/03/2023, with an estimated date of return being 02/25/2023.

On 02/10/2023, Site-19 came into possession of AO-████, which was in the testing process with a debate surrounding it on whether to upgrade the object to SCP status. The log entry of AO-████ at the time of the February 14th breach is attached below:

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Item No:** AO-████

**Item Description:** A table lamp with seven tubes in place of where a lightbulb would be. When the tubes are attached to an object, they can launch said object at speeds up to 322 km/h.

**Date of Recovery:** 02/10/2023

**Location of Recovery:** Kansas City, Missouri, United States of America

**Current Status:** Moved to Site-19 for testing.
[[/div]]

On 02/12/2023, GoI-7795 made another acquisition of a Foundation asset, this time targeting Site-19’s information storage center. This led to a site-wide breach of information, which was quickly taken care of. It is currently believed that this information breach is how the Insurgency became aware of AO-████.

**Timeline of Events:** At around 04:24, the exterior cameras around the entrance to the sewers near the emergency exit in the Acroamatic Abatement Facility of Site-19 were disabled [[footnote]] This exit was installed in 2003 in every Acroamatic Abatement Facility located within the Foundation Site System, following the second occurrence of [[[SCP-5243]]] in order to prevent as many casualties as possible should another anomaly like that occur. [[/footnote]]. This was noticed by security officer Ardath Carman, who requested for technician Richard Xiao to investigate the disabled camera, thinking it was an outage [[footnote]] This same camera has gone out twice before due to technical issues. [[/footnote]]. After an hour of no response from Xiao, Officer Carman assembled a security team to investigate the entrance at 05:32, only to discover an Insurgency squadron making their way into the building and reporting the breach to Site-19’s Head of Security, Amie Erickson.

Erickson activated the emergency alarms at 05:33 and the site went into lockdown. She called for Site-19’s elite security squadron to go after the Insurgency squadron alongside Officer Carman’s group and guard several essential areas around Site-19[[footnote]] High-Value Containment, Information Wing, Director Moose’s office. [[/footnote]].

Officer Carman’s forces were wiped out by the Insurgency, and Erickson’s forces were badly hurt, yet with no fatalities. The Insurgency squadron made their way toward the Containment Wing. Upon realizing that a breach was imminent, Erickson called for MTF Epsilon-11 (“Nine-Tailed Fox”) to assist at 05:41.

At 05:42, a second Insurgency squadron made their way into Site-19 through the ventilation shafts. How they entered the shafts is currently unknown, although it is widely believed to be due to anomalous means. The two forces made their way toward the control module of the Containment Wing, killing 5 security personnel and injuring 13 more. Upon arrival, both units converged and used the control module to release 37 SCP items and anomalous objects at 05:51. This included SCP-6118 and SCP-7513, who were located on opposite ends of the wing.

The two anomalies converged in a hallway near the entrance to the Containment Wing at 06:05. The following is a transcript of the security camera footage from the incident.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Date:** 02/14/2023

**Camera:** Containment Wing Entrance.

-----

**[BEGIN LOG]**

&lt;The footage opens with several researchers and anomalies fleeing the wing. Several Insurgency agents make their way inside the wing, carrying rifles and shooting at fleeing researchers, hitting two of them.&gt;

&lt;SCP-7513 enters, keeping itself low.&gt;

&lt;Three Insurgency agents enter from the other end of the hallway. SCP-7513 collapses on the ground, presumably playing dead. The Insurgency agents pass through the hall, not noticing SCP-7513.&gt;

&lt;As the Insurgency agents enter the frame, SCP-7513 gets up and makes its way toward the exit slowly while crouching down.&gt;

&lt;SCP-7513 gets up in alarm as yelling is heard offscreen, the Insurgency agents noticing its activity and status as an anomaly. SCP-7513 breaks into a sprint.&gt;

&lt;Three figures enter from the other side of the hallway, SCP-6118, and two Insurgency agents. SCP-6118 seems to be fleeing from the Insurgency agents. SCP-7513 freezes and looks around at the Insurgency forces.&gt;

&lt;The Insurgency agents chasing SCP-6118 catch up to it and knock it to the ground with the butt of one of their rifles. SCP-7513 yelps, looking at the fallen, but still alive SCP-6118 before kneeling on the ground with its hands in the air. SCP-6118 gets up and does the same as the Insurgency agents point their weapons at the two anomalies.&gt;

&lt;The following exchange is recorded between the Insurgency agents.&gt;

**Agent 1:** What’s the status of these two? Are we taking them in? Quickly, we have to rejoin the others ASAP.

**Agent 2:** We’ve gotta take the blue one. We had it restrained but it broke out with ease. We have to be careful with that one, but it could be useful for Delta.

**Agent 1:** And the other?

**Agent 3:** We’re not sure, but based on how it tried to evade us I’d assume it’s not a fighter.

**Agent 4:** So it’s useless?

**Agent 1:** Not necessarily. Sometimes non-fighters are just as useful as fighters. It wouldn’t hurt to take it back.

**Agent 5:** No, it’s too much of a risk. The blue one could cause problems later on. What if it escapes back at base? I’ve seen it fight, it took out two of our guys, and we don’t even know what the other one does. I say we kill them both

**Agent 3:** No, I’d say kill the redhead. Look at it cowering! It’s useless! Let’s just kill it and take the blue one.

&lt;As the Insurgency agents were talking SCP-6118 lunged at one of them and grabbed his gun, shooting him in the head. It quickly incapacitated the other four agents, shooting two of them in the shoulder before one of them tried to wrestle it. SCP-6118 swept his leg and broke his neck before grabbing the gun and shooting another agent in the head. It shot the remaining two agents in the leg before shooting both of them in the head.&gt;

&lt;SCP-6118 grabs SCP-7513 by the wrist and flees the scene.&gt;

**[END LOG]**
[[/div]]

Following this log, SCP-6118 and SCP-7513’s locations would be unknown for approximately 8 minutes.

At approximately 06:15, a third squadron from the Insurgency broke into the facility using the ventilation shafts, this time in Research Laboratory O-87. Their attack resulted in 7 casualties and 23 injuries, all of whom were research personnel. The squadron searched through the laboratory, presumably for files relating to the location of AO-████, yet they were unsuccessful, and departed the room at approximately 06:19.

At 06:21, SCP-6118 and SCP-7513 entered Research Laboratory O-87. The following is a transcript of their time in that room:

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Date:** 02/14/2023

**Camera:** Research Laboratory O-87

**[BEGIN LOG]**

&lt;SCP-6118 and SCP-7513 enters the frame, SCP-6118 is still holding onto SCP-7513’s wrist. SCP-6118 sets down SCP-7513 and gets it on the ground with its back against a nearby desk.&gt;

&lt;SCP-7513 attempts to speak to SCP-6118.&gt;

**SCP-7513:** Wh-what are you-?

&lt;SCP-6118 shushes SCP-7513 before investigating the office. After a few seconds, SCP-6118 begins to search the office for any potential weapons and ammunition. It found one rifle, which it handed to SCP-7513.&gt;

**SCP-7513:** O-oh… thanks… uhhh…

&lt;SCP-6118 turns to SCP-7513, which causes it to recoil.&gt;

**SCP-7513:** Sh-shit! Alien!

&lt;SCP-7513 attempts to get up and leave. SCP-6118 holds its arms out in an attempt to placate it.&gt;

**SCP-6118:** I’m not going to hurt you!

**SCP-7513:** H-how can I believe that? You’re a fucking alien! I know what you wanna do!

**SCP-6118:** Alright, tell me. Tell me what I want from you.

**SCP-7513:** Sex!

&lt;Silence&gt;

**SCP-7513:** You want… sex…

**SCP-6118:** Wh-what? Why would I…?

**SCP-7513:** Because every alien I’ve ever met wants to fuck me.

**SCP-6118:** Well… I’m not going to do that, so…

&lt;SCP-7513 takes a deep breath and sits down. SCP-6118 sits down next to it.&gt;

**SCP-6118:** What do you mean by… every alien?

&lt;SCP-7513 sighs.&gt;

**SCP-7513:** By every alien I mean every alien. It’s kinda why I was contained. I’m an alien magnet. Aliens are drawn to me and they either wanna fuck me or… be with me.

**SCP-6118:** R-Really…

**SCP-7513:** Yeah…

**SCP-6118:** Well… I don’t feel anything towards you and I’m an alien.

**SCP-7513:** Well, you’re the first…

**SCP-6118:** Yeah… w-wait... have you... ever met a blue-skinned species? Like mine...?

**SCP-7513:** Nope… none of the ones I’ve met have been real lookers.

**SCP-6118:** Oh…

&lt;Silence&gt;
 
**SCP-6118:** Well… I’m not going to… do anything to you. That would go against my plan.

**SCP-7513:** …What would that “plan” be?

**SCP-6118:** To break out with you.

&lt;Silence&gt;

**SCP-7513:** What?

**SCP-6118:** You heard me.

**SCP-7513:** I mean, I did, but like... //what?//

**SCP-6118:** I want to get out of here. Get away from it all. This is the perfect opportunity.

**SCP-7513:** Wait, wait, wait… Why me?

&lt;Silence&gt;

**SCP-6118:** …I don’t know. I think… it was just… the right place at the right time. Those people wanted both of us dead, after all.

**SCP-7513:** Yeah… Thanks for saving me back there.

**SCP-6118:** You’re welcome. I just thought... since I&#39;ve hurt so many people before... I would finally save someone for a change.

&lt;Silence&gt;

**SCP-6118:** If… if you don’t want to come you can stay here.

**SCP-7513:** Nah… I’m gonna… I’m gonna go with you. I don’t like being cooped up in these facilities anymore.

&lt;SCP-6118 smiles and gets up, offering its hand to SCP-7513. SCP-7513 takes its hand and gets up, holding the shotgun.&gt;

**SCP-6118:** Thank you…

**SCP-7513:** No problem… just… don’t try anything funny with me.

**SCP-6118:** I won’t, and… I think you know that.

**SCP-7513:** Wh-What? What makes you say that?

**SCP-6118:** I gave you a loaded shotgun and you didn’t try to shoot me. If you really thought I was going to hurt you, you would have just shot me.

&lt;SCP-7513 pauses for a moment while SCP-6118 starts for the exit.&gt;

**SCP-7513:** H-hey! Wait up!

&lt;SCP-7513 runs after SCP-6118 and leaves the laboratory.&gt;

**[END LOG]**

[[/div]]

At this point, all three Insurgency squadrons were searching through the files within various research laboratories and offices, while the anomalies the Insurgency let loose were causing damage around the site. Both of the described groups caused over 20 deaths and many more injuries.

At 07:13, SCP-6118 and SCP-7513 were both spotted in Research Lab M-66. The following is a transcript of their actions within the lab:

**[BEGIN LOG]**

&lt;An Insurgency agent sweeps the room using a flashlight and a pistol. SCP-6118 and SCP-7513 sneak into the lab, hiding behind a desk while out of view from the camera.&gt;

&lt;SCP-6118 approaches the agent and quickly subdues them, taking their flashlight and looking around the lab, gesturing for SCP-7513 to join it.

**SCP-6118:** They’re not dead.

&lt;SCP-7513 nods, getting up and approaching the limp body of the Insurgency agent.&gt;

**SCP-7513:** Damn… how’d you get so good at fighting?

**SCP-6118:** I don’t know. I think I had military training in the past, but…

**SCP-7513:** But…?

**SCP-6118:** I don’t know why I’d get military training in the first place… I don’t like being violent, I just… I have to. It’s the only way I can survive. I just… I need to get out of here so this can all stop.

**SCP-7513:** What, uh… what prompted this? This whole… breaking out thing?

&lt;Silence. SCP-6118 grows rigid.&gt;

**SCP-7513:** Uh… is this… something you don’t want to talk about?

**SCP-6118:** No. I just-

**SCP-7513:** Listen, I’m… I’m sorry. I didn’t know it was like that…

**SCP-6118:** It’s fine. You didn’t know.

&lt;The two anomalies continue their search. SCP-6118 picks up a spare keycard registered to Level 3 Researcher Marigold Huxley. SCP-6118 whistles to SCP-7513, showing the keycard to it. The two anomalies nod at each other before continuing with their search.&gt;

**SCP-6118:** …You’re like me, right?

**SCP-7513:** Huh?

**SCP-6118:** We are wearing the same jumpsuit. Do you… also... have a name that’s just numbers?

**SCP-7513:** Uh… numbers?

**SCP-6118:** Yeah. Mine’s SCP-6118.

**SCP-7513:** Oh... Well, they call me SCP-7513, but… I prefer the name Forrest.

**SCP-6118:** T-two names?

**SCP-7513:** Yep! Had the name Forrest since birth. You don’t have a name outside of your ID?

**SCP-6118:** I don’t… remember my name.

&lt;SCP-7513 opens a cabinet and pulls out a folder. It opens the folder and flips through the contents.&gt;

**SCP-7513:** So… amnesia?

**SCP-6118:** I don’t know. The doctors never said if I did have amnesia. I think they think I’m lying.

**SCP-7513:** I don’t think you’re lying.

**SCP-6118:** Really?

**SCP-7513:** Yeah, I trust you.

**SCP-6118:** Thanks…

&lt;SCP-7513 pulls out a folded piece of paper and opens it up.&gt;

**SCP-7513:** This is it…

**SCP-6118:** Huh?

**SCP-7513:** This is the map of the facility! Look!

&lt;SCP-6118 joins SCP-7513 by the desk.&gt;

**SCP-7513:** I think these are the different floors, and that right there, M-66, that was on the door. I think that’s where we are. Those are… I think those are elevators, and… there!

&lt;SCP-7513 points at the map.&gt;

**SCP-7513:** That’s our exit! In the… in the, uhh…

**SCP-6118:** Here… let me see…

&lt;SCP-6118 grabs the map from SCP-7513 and looks closely at it.&gt;

**SCP-6118:** Ack…row…ah…may…tick…

**SCP-7513:** I think it rhymes with “acrobatic”.

**SCP-6118:** Ab… ab… ab…bay

**SCP-7513:** Listen, I don’t care how it’s pronounced, it’s the closest exit we have! It’s an emergency evacuation exit, but still!

&lt;SCP-6118 sets down the map and runs its finger along it.&gt;

**SCP-6118:** You’re right.

**SCP-7513:** Alright, let’s get going…

&lt;SCP-6118 and SCP-7513 both take the map and start to leave.&gt;

**SCP-7513:** Wait… uh…

&lt;SCP-6118 turns around.&gt;

**SCP-6118:** Hm?

**SCP-7513:** Do you mind if I call you Six? Just for shortened purposes.

**SCP-6118:** Uh… s-sure…

&lt;SCP-6118 and SCP-7513 both leave the room.&gt;

**[END LOG]**

[[/div]]

At 07:23, an Insurgency squadron entered Research Laboratory E-13 and inspected it for files. During this investigation, they came across a file that details the location in which AO-████ is located. The squadron alerted the other two, and all three started to make their way down to the chamber in which AO-████ is located.

At 07:25, MTF Epsilon-11 (“Nine-Tailed Fox”) arrived on-site and entered the facility, being briefed on the situation by Erickson. They proceeded to split into two groups, one heading toward the laboratories in search of the Insurgency agents, while the other fanned out around the facility in search of the missing anomalies.

At 07:27, both SCP-6118 and SCP-7513 were spotted in the west wing testing hall, which was their fastest way to Site-19’s Acroamatic Abatement Facility. While there, they encountered a group of Insurgency members who were on their way to the testing chamber for AO-████. The two anomalies, in response, entered a storage unit for non-anomalous cleaning supplies where they rested. The following is a transcript of this incident:

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

[BEGIN LOG]

&lt;The two anomalies enter the storage room and close the entrance. They appear out of breath, leaning against the entrance.&gt;

**SCP-7513:** God… fuck…

&lt;The anomalies look at each other.&gt;

**SCP-6118:** Do you… think they’re gone?

**SCP-7513:** I… don’t know…

&lt;The sound of boots could faintly be heard outside of the room.&gt;

**SCP-6118:** I… I don’t want to go back to the cell…

&lt;SCP-7513 nods. The two anomalies sit in silence.&gt;

**SCP-6118:** Hey…

**SCP-7513:** What?

**SCP-6118:** I was just wondering… what sort of tests did they run on you?

**SCP-7513:** Tests? Uh… just a few psychological ones. Tests on my state of mind and all that. Why’d you ask?

**SCP-6118:** Just curious…

**SCP-7513:** Oh…

&lt;Silence&gt;

**SCP-7513:** Well, since you asked about tests, what were yours like?

&lt;SCP-6118 doesn’t respond, a pensive look on its face.&gt;

**SCP-7513:** Oh… did they… hurt you?

&lt;SCP-6118 shrugs.&gt;

**SCP-7513:** I-I’m sorry if they did…

&lt;SCP-7513 puts a hand on SCP-6118’s shoulder.&gt;

**SCP-6118:** It&#39;s fine. Really. It&#39;s not that bad.

**SCP-7513:** Well if you&#39;re trying to get out of here, I think it is that bad.

&lt;SCP-7513 nods its head. SCP-6118 buries its face in its knees.&gt;

**SCP-7513:** We’ll get out of here… I promise

**SCP-6118:** Mmmhmm…

&lt;Silence&gt;

**SCP-6118:** I’m sorry…

**SCP-7513:** Why?

**SCP-6118:** I’m sorry for dragging you into all of this.

**SCP-7513:** There’s no need to apologize, you saved my life, and I want to get out of here too.

**SCP-6118:** I… shouldn’t have brought you along.

**SCP-7513:** Wh-what

**SCP-6118:** You were fine! You don’t have tests like mine! You have your own name! You, uh… you have it good, and now I’m dragging you into all of this.

**SCP-7513:** Six... That cell is… boring. All I do is doodle and play solitaire. I’ve been doing that all day every day for the past year! That’s not to mention what happened last month.

**SCP-6118:** What… happened last month?

&lt;Silence&gt;

**SCP-7513:** I was… abducted. I was abducted by a person in a suit named Randolph. They took me on a… “vacation,” they called it. They… they brought me to this big pot in the middle of this… this big white expanse… and I had to climb this… giant ladder. I got back but… I don’t feel safe anymore.

&lt;Silence&gt;

**SCP-6118:** I’m… sorry that happened.

**SCP-7513:** No need to apologize. As you said, you weren&#39;t there. Besides, Randolph was a nice person, just a bit... weird. I feel like we would have gotten closer if… if they hadn’t died.

&lt;SCP-6118 pats SCP-7513 on the shoulder.&gt;

**SCP-7513:** I… I do wanna help you break out, though. They don’t treat you like they should. You’re… you’re a good person, and I think you deserve better.

&lt;The two anomalies share a look and smile.&gt;

**SCP-6118:** I think they’re gone…

**SCP-7513:** Let’s go then.

&lt;The two anomalies leave the storage unit.&gt;

&lt;Three members of MTF Ε-11, codenamed Golf, Hotel, and India, are seen scanning the area. SCP-6118 and SCP-7513 are visible in the bottom right corner, hiding from the MTF.&gt;

**Ε-11 Golf:** Area clear, proceeding onwards.

&lt;The three members make their departure. After a few seconds, SCP-6118 and SCP-7513 emerge from their hiding spot, quietly looking around.&gt;

**SCP-7513:** All clear.

&lt;The anomalies proceed onwards, keeping low.&gt;

&lt;SCP-7513 and SCP-6118 appear on the camera, slowly descending the hallway. They soon duck behind a container of specialized cleaning solution.&gt;

&lt;A minute passes and SCP-6118’s hand is visible on the bottom left corner of the feed. No other sightings of the two anomalies are on this recording.&gt;

Following this log’s occurrence, MTF Ε-11 was alerted of SCP-6118 and SCP-7513’s presence in 19-AAF, and a strike team of newer members that were led by Ε-11 Delta, who had prior experience as a guard on the SCP-6118 project, and consisting of Delta, Echo, Foxtrot, and Golf, was deployed.

**Date:** 02/14/2023

**Camera:** 19-AAF Camera 15 (Emergency Exit Camera)

**[BEGIN LOG]**

&lt;SCP-7513 and SCP-6118 appear from behind a row of tubes, hastily approaching the emergency exit. The bodies of the security squadron sent by Ardath Carman can be seen. SCP-7513 reaches for the doorknob but SCP-6118 stops it.&gt;

**SCP-6118:** Wait, I just… I just wanted to say before we go... thanks...

**SCP-7513:** For what?

**SCP-6118:** For, uh... for being here.

**SCP-7513:** Well... you&#39;re welcome.

&lt;SCP-6118 falls silent, standing rigid.&gt;

**SCP-7513:** Are you alright?

**SCP-6118:** Yeah... I&#39;m just... thinking about things I haven&#39;t thought about in a [[[Hominophobia|long time]]]...

**SCP-7513:** We should... probably not be getting lost in our thoughts right before we get out of here.

**SCP-6118:** Alright…

**SCP-7513:** Are you ready?

**SCP-6118:** I’m ready.

&lt;Before they could open the door, MTF Ε-11 appears, weapons drawn and aimed at the anomalies.&gt;

**Ε-11 Delta:** Freeze! Don&#39;t move!

&lt;The anomalies freeze and put their hands in the air.&gt;

**Ε-11 Delta:** Turn around now! Put your weapons down! Get on the ground!

&lt;The anomalies comply, turning around and getting on their knees.&gt;

**Ε-11 Delta:** We have secured the breached anomalies, proceeding with recontainment.

&lt;E-11 Echo and Foxtrot approach the anomalies with handcuffs before attempting to secure them. SCP-7513 was successfully cuffed, but SCP-6118 swept E-11 Foxtrot’s leg and pulled out a concealed gun, firing into his head.&gt;

**Ε-11 Echo:** Shot’s fired, Foxtrot’s dow-

&lt;Ε-11 Echo screams as SCP-6118 fires another shot into his arm and leg before breaking the handcuffs of SCP-7513 and knocking E-11 Echo unconscious with its gun. SCP-7513 retrieves its shotgun and fires at E-11 Golf’s head, severely injuring him.&gt;

**SCP-7513:** Get away from us!

&lt;SCP-6118 breaks E-11 Delta’s arm and retrieves their weapon, firing at E-11 Delta, though they remained unscathed due to their bulletproof vest. SCP-7513 and SCP-6118 exit using the emergency exit.&gt;

**Ε-11 Delta:** Stupid! Son of a... I&#39;m gonna kill you!

&lt;E-11 Delta quickly makes its way to the exit and follows the two anomalies.&gt;

**[END LOG]**

[[/div]]

During the events transcribed in the above log, the members of MTF E-11 not in the task force that tried to apprehend the escaped anomalies attempted to attack the members of the Chaos Insurgency that had caused the breach, however, due to the missing members, MTF E-11 was weaker than normal, which caused the Insurgency to be able to abscond with AO-████.

Of the members of the task force that went after the two escaped anomalies and got injured, only E-11 Foxtrot suffered wounds drastic enough to be fatal. E-11 Golf miraculously made a full recovery after a two-week coma and multiple life-saving surgeries.

E-11 Delta continued his pursuit of SCP-6118 and SCP-7513, eventually meeting them in the sewers where the Insurgency members entered. The following is a transcription from E-11 Delta’s body cam, which he had turned on prior to engaging with the escaped anomalies, as is protocol.

**[BEGIN LOG]**

&lt;E-11 Delta turns on his body cam, showing the area outside of the sewers. SCP-6118 and SCP-7513 are seen hunched over at the entrance. The body of Technician Richard Xiao can be seen in the grass, alongside the destroyed security camera. E-11 Delta pulls out his pistol and aims it at the anomalies.&gt;

**Ε-11 Delta:** Freeze!

&lt;The anomalies turn around. SCP-6118 brandishes the gun it stole from E-11 Delta at him, who fires a warning shot nearby SCP-7513, who yelps and backs away. SCP-6118 fires the stolen gun at the ground in front of E-11 Delta.&gt;

**SCP-7513:** Get back!

&lt;SCP-7513 pulls out its shotgun and fires it at E-11 Delta, who fires back, injuring SCP-7513&#39;s hand. SCP-6118 fires at E-11 Delta, who shoots back and knocks the

**SCP-7513:** Wh-why are you doing this?

**Ε-11 Delta:** Because it&#39;s my duty as an agent of the SCP Foundation.

**SCP-7513:** Why are you hurting us?

&lt;Silence. Ε-11 Delta approaches the two anomalies&gt;

**SCP-6118:** G-get away from us!

**SCP-7513:** Don&#39;t hurt him any more than your... group already have!

**Ε-11 Delta:** What group? You wiped out all of our men! Unless you mean...

&lt;SCP-6118 picks up Ε-11 Delta&#39;s gun off of the ground and fires it at Ε-11 Delta, who backs up.&gt;

**SCP-6118:** I said get away!

**Ε-11 Delta:** Did 6118 tell you it hurt?

&lt;Silence&gt;

**Ε-11 Delta:** It was simple blood sampling. That thing&#39;s cells can save countless lives! Imagine if we found a... an anomalous cold that we can&#39;t cure. We could introduce the virus to 6118 and take its blood! That blood... it can be a vaccine!

**SCP-6118:** S-shut up!

**Ε-11 Delta:** You shut up, SCP-6118! Insolent brat!

&lt;SCP-6118 lunges at Ε-11 Delta, who punched it in the face and knocked it to the ground.&gt;

**SCP-7513:** Six!

&lt;SCP-7513 picks up its shotgun and fires at Ε-11 Delta in spite of the wound. The bullet hits Ε-11 Delta&#39;s bulletproof vest, leaving him unharmed.&gt;

**Ε-11 Delta:** Oh... I see... did you finally find an alien you like? How fitting, a stupid, insolent little alien for a stupid, insolent little man.

**SCP-6118:** Fuck you!

**Ε-11 Delta:** Aww… why’s the alien getting all sad?

&lt;SCP-6118 gets up and twists Ε-11 Delta&#39;s broken arm. Ε-11 Delta screams in pain. SCP-7513 fires its shotgun into Ε-11 Delta&#39;s leg, causing him to collapse. SCP-7513 repeatedly kicks the downed agent, before getting SCP-6118 up. SCP-6118 and SCP-7513 both kick Ε-11 Delta repeatedly for roughly 30 seconds, before both anomalies grab their weapons and leave.&gt;

&lt;After a minute of silence, Ε-11 Delta starts to move again, talking into it&#39;s communicator.&gt;

**Ε-11 Delta:** We’ve lost them…

**[END LOG]**

[[/div]]

Following this encounter, neither SCP-7513 nor SCP-6118 has been spotted by the Foundation.

**Aftermath:** Several MTFs have been assigned to locate and recontain the missing anomalies, as well as AO-████. An investigation has also been launched into any other files that could have been obtained by the Chaos Insurgency, which is deemed a top priority by the Foundation.

Following the encounter in the sewers, E-11 Delta was suspended from activities and operation within MTF E-11 due to inappropriate conduct during the retrieval mission. Administrators, as well as the Ethics Committee, are going to have a hearing related to E-11 Delta&#39;s further operation within the Foundation, and whether or not E-11 Delta is fit to be a part of the Foundation.
