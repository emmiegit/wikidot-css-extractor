[[include component:image-block name=scp-2208.jpg|caption=SCP-2208 with testing cord and lid]]

**Item #:** SCP-2208

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2208 is to be kept in a Level 4 secure storage locker in Site-57. Personnel wishing to access SCP-2208 must obtain permission from the Site Director. Instances of SCP-2208-A are to be cataloged and placed in non-hazardous storage.[[footnote]]Next of kin are to be informed of death and loss of remains per Foundation Ethics Protocol 283-A-5: Family and Survivors With Unrecoverable Remains.[[/footnote]] Full-body protection must be worn at all times when testing SCP-2208.

**Description:** SCP-2208 is a 2-quart ██████-brand stainless steel saucepan. The inside is coated in a nonstick polymer believed to be polytetrafluoroethylene.[[footnote]]Marketed as &#34;Teflon&#34;. Materials testing has not been possible.[[/footnote]] The handle has been modified to include a USB standard-A receptacle, --the purpose of which has yet to be determined-- investigation of which is pending.[[footnote]]See Addendum 2208-02.[[/footnote]] SCP-2208 does not transfer heat as a stainless steel saucepan should, and heat testing up to 2,300°C has been unable to warm its surface.

When a human subject makes skin contact with any part of SCP-2208, there is a 29% chance the subject will be transformed into a saucepan (SCP-2208-A) in a process that takes ~0.8 seconds. Instances of SCP-2208-A match SCP-2208&#39;s appearance, apart from the lack of USB receptacle; they are otherwise non-anomalous. Subjects unaffected by initial contact with SCP-2208 are able to safely handle it thereafter.[[footnote]]For a list of personnel immune to the effects of SCP-2208, reference Document 2208-02-b.[[/footnote]] A predictive pattern of SCP-2208&#39;s effects has yet to be determined.

**Interview 2208-01**

&gt; **Interviewed:** J██████ Nuñez
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Agent Alvarez-Montaña
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** SCP-2208 was recovered from the home of J██████ Nuñez of Westway, Texas, USA, along with 145 other saucepans believed to be instances of SCP-2208-A. The home was raided after a four-month federal investigation into the disappearances of more than ███ individuals from the area. Foundation agents embedded with the FBI were alerted to SCP-2208&#39;s anomalous properties after 3 federal and 1 Foundation agent were converted into instances of SCP-2208-A. The object was recovered by a federal agent immune to its effects, and Ms. Nuñez was questioned by the Foundation. Interview translated from Spanish.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Alvarez:** What can you tell us about the saucepan we recovered from your home? The one that transforms people.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ms. Nuñez:** God created man in His own image.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Alvarez:** I don&#39;t understand.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ms. Nuñez:** God does not make mistakes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Alvarez:** I don&#39;t know what you mean. Maybe you can explain why you haven&#39;t been changed? I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve touched it. Is there a reason why some are changed and some aren&#39;t?
&gt; 
&gt; **Ms. Nuñez:** You and I, we are unworthy. I brought more and more faithful to him, yet still am I forsaken. //[begins to cry]// Why am I not worthy?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Alvarez:** Make sure you tell the Bureau about that later. //[pauses]// Are you sure you don&#39;t know anything more about how it works, or why?
&gt; 
&gt; **Ms. Nuñez:** God does not make mistakes, Mister Agent. If God were to change, His image would change, also.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Ms. Nuñez was remanded to FBI custody after a standard containment period and administration of amnestics. She cooperated with authorities in locating the remains of the ███ individuals not accounted for by SCP-2208-A instances and was charged in their deaths.

**Addendum 2208-02:** On ██/██/20██, while performing routine testing on SCP-2208&#39;s USB receptacle, Junior Researcher L███ was simultaneously recharging an MP3 player via USB on the test computer, in violation of testing procedures. After testing was complete, Junior Researcher L███ discovered a new file on his device, named &#34;un_w721g.mp3&#34; and remanded his MP3 player to custody for study. A transcript of the audio file follows.

&gt; //[File begins with 4 seconds of white noise, followed by a surprised feminine voice.]//
&gt; 
&gt; Ow! What? What&#39;s this? Hello? Is that you guys? Listen, I haven&#39;t had anything to work with in like two months. Is that why you missed my last couple paychecks? It&#39;s been a while. I&#39;m not a charity here! I&#39;ve got expenses! And all these other people you sent in, they&#39;re starting to smell. It&#39;s been a while. Look, either you get me some new material, you pay me, or you find yourself a new employee. Once I figure out how to get out of here, anyway. It&#39;s been a while.

Containment procedures are currently under review.
