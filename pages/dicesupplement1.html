**Description:** SCP-7000 is a six-sided die that occasionally lands on a seven. It is 1.8cm wide, white with blue dots except for in the &#34;one&#34; and &#34;seven&#34; faces which are red, and plastic in make as pictured in this file. Previously, it was held under the Stationary Items Unit of Site-18V and used in its breakroom by Stationary Items Manager Dr. McCallum before his passing in a Dungeons and Dragons campaign viewed by multiple personnel in aforementioned site, with documentation. It has been discovered, based on these multiple witness accounts, that the die currently being used by Dr. Coin and her team for research is in fact not the real SCP-7000. The certificate for this item is intact and still in its containment box in Site-18V so that there is no discrepancy, and at a glance the die pictured in the above image is very similar to the item, but upon closer inspection is a near-exact non-anomalous copy. This was discovered by Dr. Morgan, who was visiting Dr. Coin&#39;s office and noticed the lack of a nick on the &#34;five&#34; face awarded from slamming it against the table on one occasion, later confirmed by janitor Nelcha who had video documentation in a twenty second clip of this event saved on her cellphone.

Quote, &#34;It was kinda funny in a fucked up way seeing the middle aged guy with heart problems lose his shit over a game. This moment had been building up for like... a few minutes before the videoI&#39;d say? I managed to catch the exact moment he boiled over. Never knew it&#39;d be important, so, uh, lucky us!&#34; This detail is now marked as a &#34;lucky event&#34; and Dr. Morgan&#39;s hypothesis of tychekinesis in SCP-7000 is officially considered after being dismissed since the runtime of the Dungeons and Dragons campaign. An apology from Dr. Coin issued in the form of chocolate cake is endorsed by Site Director Preston.

Reviewing the trading and storage log of Site-18V it was determined that the item had been stolen in the two-year gap between Dr. McCallum passing and Dr. Coin reviving the project. There had been an influx in items traded in from the decennial renewal of the Kiryu Labs treaty during this period, and as these items were being moved around there were several instances where items were reorganized into different places than their original storage, and SCP-7000 was no exception.

It should be noted that King Holdings Ltd. is the company Kiryu Labs Researcher Shen represents in the greater Kiryu Labs corporation network, and thus exists a tie towards the origin of SCP-7000 and Researcher Shen, being that Crown Casino under King Holdings Ltd. is where SCP-7000 originated from. Investigation towards this researcher and some notable Kiryu Labs members are subsequently carried out.

Based on the interviews done by Dr. Morgan towards Researcher Shen, Dr. Kiryu, Researcher Kiryu, Dr. Mercer, and Researcher Song, the following is documented:

1. Researcher Shen was not aware of SCP-7000 existing on account of exclusively studying bioengineering and being the youngest of eight siblings which meant he does not have much stake in King Holdings Ltd. as it is a family company, but he has been made compliant to convince their board to allow the mobilization of undercover Foundation personnel into Crown Casino as a means to find this item, within the existing contract under the Kiryu Labs treaty. Support is provided by the tychekinetic research subdepartment as well as a team of Mobile Task Force agents, and Dr. Coin is at present personally overseeing this mission under the direction of O5-5 &#34;Blackbird&#34;.

As an extraneous note, Researcher Shen was given a copy of the Level 2 version of SCP-7000&#39;s document, and upon learning its history and importance to Site-18V, paid his respects to Dr. McCallum&#39;s civilian resting place in Storith as well as visiting the bereaved. He has made routine weekly trips from Site-17 to Site-18V for this purpose, updating the family on leads regarding SCP-7000.

2. Dr. Kiryu had recently been hired as site director for Site-17 when SCP-7000&#39;s disappearance seemed to have occurred. Dr. Kiryu and the investigation team looked through every item transfer record from the past two years and found that 196 items had been moved from Site-18V to Site-17. Most of the items were Kiryu Labs property to begin with, and thus SCP-7000 was notably not in the list of items that were referenced to Kiryu Labs. She notes that Researcher Kiryu was the one actually handling most business matters under the company in her absence running the corporation. Researcher Kiryu himself has moved to Storith since a year before this interview and thus does not come into frequent contact with Dr. Kiryu enough for her to know much. It should be noted that aside from Foundation duties, Researcher Kiryu has also acted as a liaison for Kiryu Labs to other anomalous companies which includes King Holdings, Ltd. within the Kiryu labs network.

3. Researcher Kiryu and Dr. Mercer were both in the former&#39;s residence when Foundation personnel made a visit for this interview, so both were done consecutively. Researcher Kiryu was understandably displeased at the intrusion, but was cooperative enough to show personnel his notebook detailing every single item that had been moved around or traded off. He remarked that putting a number on an SCP object is not only a sign of permanent possession by The Foundation, but also comes with the responsibility of actually keeping it in containment. This remark sparked an altercation where the interviewer brought up how the item was stolen by someone involved in the moving of containment and was not lost over issues in the containment itself, which was responded by Researcher Kiryu with criticizing Dr. McCallum&#39;s leadership and management over the Stationary Items Unit of Site-18V. This motivated the interviewer to strike Researcher Kiryu out of an emotional reaction, and had to be stopped by Dr. Mercer physically standing between the two. Dr. Morgan reprimanded after all interviews concluded, and scheduled an evaluation with Dr. Glass.

4. Dr. Mercer is in the veterinary field and has no connection to SCP-7000 aside from his pre-established personal connection to Researcher Kiryu. He stated that Kiryu Labs personnel should not be the ones interrogated as their responsibility was only toward their own anomalous objects with nothing extraneous to their existing list. Dr. Mercer proceeds to point out that Researcher Kiryu had an assistant that only recently got transferred to a different post, who is Researcher Song, who can cross-check any position trades within Foundation spaces as their position in the Finances department allows.

5. Interviewer and Researcher Song cross-checked the records of items within Foundation trading, and found that SCP-7000 had never left Site-18V on paper, therefore clearing this incident from any clerical error. It was initially deemed that with all the storage being moved the chances of discovering such a small item&#39;s whereabouts was impossible. However, as this interview progressed, a stickynote with worn out adhesive fell out of the records which detailed SCP-7000 being moved from the first floor to the second floor alongside the entire cabinet of other items it was contained in. Interviewer recognizes the handwriting to be Dr. McCallum&#39;s. This will also be considered &#34;a lucky event&#34; and be documented, and then put together with SCP-7000&#39;s research notes.

CCTV footage of the specific day this occurred was played back, and the cabinet in question was moved via forklift into the maintenance shaft, in which Researcher Song was accompanying Researcher Kiryu to document the list of anomalous items being moved around. At 13:13 hours, the forklift entered the maintenance shaft and the researchers went downstairs through the personnel elevator as the forklift took up too much space to fit extra people inside. The cabinet had been ill-secured and tipped over onto the forklift, though causing no damage, impacted the cabinet enough that SCP-7000&#39;s cabinet door swung open and spilled out the item, its legal paper and documents, as well as Dr. McCallum&#39;s notebook. Once the forklift could back out of the maintenance shaft, the driver took the scattered items and drove the cabinet to its new location.

The researchers notice the driver with the items, and handed them to Researcher Kiryu, who proceeded to read its document while waiting for the cabinet to be placed down. Once the cabinet was put in its designated location, Researcher Kiryu put the items back into the cabinet. No foul play was detected in three separate camera angles, and despite no other point where SCP-7000 could have been stolen, there is no video proof that would reasonably warrant further investigation.

Interviewer then asked if Researcher Song remembered this interaction, in which he said he did not. In fact, he did not even remember following Researcher Kiryu into the Stationary Items wing at all, and only remembers doing the paperwork and documents in the Kiryu Labs office later that day. The use of amnestics to suppress this interaction is highly suspected, and if it is confirmed that the disappearance happened within this time frame, Researcher Kiryu will be subject to the relevant consequences.

&gt; //The following is a transcript of an interview requested specifically by O5-2 &#34;Bureaucracy&#34; towards Dr. Morgan and Dr. Coin regarding SCP-7000&#39;s impact on Site-18V. Interview was conducted by his Adjutant Proxy, but the Overseer himself was present through an open telephone line in the middle of the table.//
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-2 &#34;Bureaucracy&#34;&#39;s Adjutant Proxy:** Today we meet to discuss the social effects SCP-7000 had towards Site-18V. Beyond this sentence until the recording stops, everything said in this meeting will remain on record and be documented in SCP-7000&#39;s document; adjusted in accordance to clearance levels.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Coin:** Thank you, uh, sorry, what do we call you?
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-2 &#34;Bureaucracy&#34;&#39;s Adjutant Proxy:** Proxy will suffice, madam.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Morgan:** Right. So, I believe I should start off since I DMed for the campaign in the first place... DMing is kind of like leading the game, where I wrote the story and others play in the world I build. I spent a lot of time crafting this storyline because of my archival work being slow most days. There&#39;s always a game night in Stationary, so I thought surely some people have enough free time weekly to sit around with me... and I struck gold with finding party members that not only were familiar with the game but also passionate enough to make time for a session every Friday night.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Coin:** Which. God damn it you were right-
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Morgan:** And I will //get// to why I was right later... but that&#39;s not the main thing. I do want to note for this interview that getting consistent party members is a solid achievement in managing a Dungeons and Dragons campaign, and this further corroborates the fact that SCP-7000 is tychekinetic in a scope larger than statistics, in which I will endlessly brag to Dr. Coin for being right about it from the start.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, with apologies for both being lax in wording, being forward, and raising my voice, Overseer, I will re-state for the recording that I saw how the die fell out of the cabinet on transport and was briefly in the hand of Researcher Kiryu. I am fully convinced that he has it in his possession, as that is because a very similar thing happened for Dr. McCallum; the night I went to organize a DnD party was the same night where I had to work together with Dr. McCallum to document every new item in the Stationary Items wing, and I tripped on his foot when reaching for the plastic box of small trinkets. He caught me and partially caught the box, though most of it spilled all over... and...
&gt; 
&gt; When he opened his hand, the die was there, neatly wrapped in one of those clear plastic things for takeout sauce, labeled &#34;Anomalous Item #13&#34;. I did not make the luck connection until much later due to emotional panic from the situation.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Coin:** I&#39;ve heard this anecdote multiple times from both parties, and if it isn&#39;t real, holding a very convincing lie for five whole years is very impressive.
&gt; 
&gt; //Adjutant Proxy picks up the open phone handle and puts it to their ear, seeing the light cue on the corner of the device.//
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-2 &#34;Bureaucracy&#34;&#39;s Adjutant Proxy:** Mm. Mm-hm. Right. O5-2 would like to know your motivation in allowing Dr. McCallum to use SCP-7000 in game nights, as the person responsible for the campaign.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Morgan:** At the time we only knew it rolled a seven sometimes, but not to the very specific 1.6% noted in the files and much less that it influences... all this. I&#39;m open to be proven wrong, of course, but when every roll is convenient and every die&#39;s owner is exorbitantly fortunate, it sends a message that the thing has a stickier effect than what it looks like on the surface. Anyway, no particular motive; he wanted to research it head-on and saw the campaign as a way to do that without rolling it over and over again tediously for the results he wanted. I allowed it to count in gameplay because admittedly, it&#39;s fun for the whole table and the crowd whenever it happens.
&gt; 
&gt; I remember really well, very early in the campaign Dr. McCallum would use the die for any excuse he could come up with. Considering his character was a rogue and his whole... gameplay is sneaking and attacking, entry level characters were very many and could be picked off solo. There was plenty of data, and I witnessed a lot of the luck from behind the DM&#39;s divider. You know how a dealer in a casino rigs the cards? I felt like I was a dealer trying very hard to chump Dr. McCallum, but he always asspulled a victory anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; Until the very end. His character made the killing blow to end the campaign //without a single drop// of terminal illness pity that rigged it. That roll was a seven, and that seven was exactly the amount he needed. Dr. Coin doesn&#39;t know this, I- Chrys,
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Coin:** No, no, it&#39;s okay. You never found the time. Or, like, a good time. I&#39;m still grieving and I... thank you for being considerate. I saw your expression that last session, a sort of //&#34;that&#39;s that, huh&#34;// expression. I had a feeling.
&gt; 
&gt; //A silence is allowed to pass, as all participants at the table had a moment to quietly cry.//
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-2 &#34;Bureaucracy&#34;&#39;s Adjutant Proxy:** We will move on from this topic. We already know it is tychekinetic. No need for any more anecdotes of it. Plus, Dr. Coin, I understand you were very specifically eager to join the tychekinesis research subdepartment under the physics research department. Dr. McCallum&#39;s would-have-been subdepartment.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Coin:** What a cruel way to refer to my very talented team of individuals. They are not Alvey- Dr. McCallum, alone. I am grieving my feelings, not narcissistically perpetuating the idea of him.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-2 &#34;Bureaucracy&#34;&#39;s Adjutant Proxy:** My apologies.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Coin:** No, no need to apologize. That was unforgivable.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m not mad, though, it&#39;s right that I&#39;m doing this out of a selfish intent. I know I&#39;ve been briefed that this will be returned to containment as it should, but I... really just want to see and hold the item again. I want to hand this over to his family, I want to tell them how good he was to all of us. He was one of the best people on the board of 18V and I love him very much. Personal feelings will not count in work, I know, and despite the desire to do all of that, I doubt that would be for the best-
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Morgan:** You need a minute?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Coin:** Ideal as that may be I&#39;ll simply break down if I stop. If the council so requests it, I will do my best to get the item back. I am prepared mentally to do most anything to get SCP-7000 in its rightful little box in its rightful little cabinet and I don&#39;t //care// if the item wants to luck out and find itself in someone else&#39;s palm later, I&#39;ll even develop some- luck stabilizer thing, maybe name it after [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_de_Moivre Moivre], maybe- I&#39;ll do anything. I really would.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-2 &#34;Bureaucracy&#34;&#39;s Adjutant Proxy:** ...O5-2 sends his condolences, and assures you a leading  position in the retrieval unit for SCP-7000 if that is satisfactory.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Coin:** It is. It- it is.
&gt; 
&gt; //Dr. Morgan comforts the now crying Dr. Coin, and Adjutant Proxy passes tissues across the table.//
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-2 &#34;Bureaucracy&#34;&#39;s Adjutant Proxy:** I presume that there is little left to say. If this is a satisfying end to this interview, I will draw it to a close.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Morgan:** Yeah. Thank you, Proxy, Overseer.

During the time of these documentations, Mark Kiryu had officially resigned from his position as Foundation Researcher, citing the constant interviews and air of suspicion being a stressful work environment. As this was processed before any protocol of apprehending him, he has legally become a civilian under Foundation ruling. In addition, this very day marks one year and one month into his residence in Storith, which based on The City&#39;s laws cement him as an official citizen of Storith and subject to its treaty thus.

Sourced from the account of Dr. Mercer, who was present in this event, Mark Kiryu celebrated his new citizenship by purchasing 55% of the stock of King Holdings Ltd. spread across three different subdepartment accounts of the Kiryu Labs corporation and held a party in Crown Casino for it. Upon questioning where the funds for such a gesture was amassed, Mark Kiryu led Dr. Mercer to a room where a pile of dice identical to SCP-7000 had been laid out on a pool table. Mark Kiryu asked Dr. Mercer to arbitrarily pick any die from the pile, and successfully picked SCP-7000, confirmed by the signature nick on the &#34;five&#34; face and rolling the die on a &#34;seven&#34; face. The die was then taken by Mark Kiryu.

Later into the party, Researcher Shen was publicly announced to be legally removed from the beneficiary list of King Holdings Ltd. citing that over half of King Holdings is under Mark Kiryu&#39;s management and that he had familial consent to go through with the decision. Upon seeing Researcher Shen becoming immediately distressed, Dr. Mercer and Dr. Kiryu removed themselves from the party with Researcher Shen in tow. Dr. Mercer gave this statement as Dr. Kiryu took Researcher Shen to Site-18V&#39;s medical wing. Dr. Glass happened to be on traveling duty and immediately assumed professional care; Dr. Kiryu insists on remaining in medical until Researcher Shen is stable.

The O5 Council decides to hold a partial meeting to discuss means of re-containment.

&gt; //The following is a transcript of a partial overseer meeting regarding the extraction of SCP-7000 from Storith. It should be noted that O5-2 &#34;Bureaucracy&#34; sent his Adjutant Proxy in his stead due to his admittance of assured personal bias if he were to attend this meeting, which was prior accepted by O5-4 &#34;Blockplan&#34; and O5-5 &#34;Blackbird&#34;.//
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-2 &#34;Bureaucracy&#34;&#39;s Adjutant Proxy:** Today we meet to discuss the extraction of SCP-7000 from The City of Storith. Beyond this sentence until the recording stops, everything said in this meeting will remain on record and be documented in SCP-7000&#39;s document; adjusted in accordance to clearance levels.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5 &#34;Blackbird&#34;:** Thank you, Proxy. I will begin: The mayor of Storith has responded with a letter noting that Mark Kiryu is an official resident of the city no longer affiliated with The Foundation, and under the Storith treaty can have his investigation halted when deemed excessive. However, my personal security team is an entity that is outside of The Foundation, and I am willing to mobilize them for the extraction of SCP-7000.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-4 &#34;Blockplan&#34;:** I do think that you&#39;re being excessive, first of all, and secondly this does not solve the problem of extracting 7000 from Storith in the first place; I would even say you&#39;d probably pull the same thing Mark Kiryu is and keep it to yourself using this very legal document we agreed upon as an excuse.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5 &#34;Blackbird&#34;:** I miss the times where we just storm places and take things. A flick of a finger and a warehouse is razed without a single causality... on our part, at least. Admit that it&#39;s effective... or don&#39;t. I know it is.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-4 &#34;Blockplan&#34;:** You and your violence and your pet agents.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-2 &#34;Bureaucracy&#34;&#39;s Adjutant Proxy:** We&#39;ve agreed to be pragmatic for our current goals. Five, do not joke about doing anything the council disapproves of, and Four, please do not overreact to jokes in general. Overseer Bureaucracy has also noted that he is in favour of the motion to soft-contain it as the general public sees fit; minimally invasive, and maximally peacekeeping.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5 &#34;Blackbird&#34;:** I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m providing the one and only solution, I&#39;m saying we don&#39;t have to play fair and square. I don&#39;t want to blow up a whole casino for one object, but cheating the house out of a good hand is always morally correct; we&#39;ve given them so many resources already. We let them get away with so much!
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-4 &#34;Blockplan&#34;:** And we will continue to let them &#34;get away with it&#34; in the name of a peaceful resolution. We can&#39;t be pirates and terrorists forever, we used to be better than the other groups and we&#39;ve agreed to spend this decade trying to be chill again. Genuinely, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve gotten with the program.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5 &#34;Blackbird&#34;:** ...you&#39;re saying I should retire?
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-4 &#34;Blockplan&#34;:** I&#39;m saying I hope you die soon.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-2 &#34;Bureaucracy&#34;&#39;s Adjutant Proxy:** I will be adjourning this meeting until both of you learn to behave around each other. You are council members, not children.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5 &#34;Blackbird&#34;:** No, no, they have a point, Proxy, I&#39;m just amused that they have //bite// today.
&gt; ...I&#39;m the third oldest fart in this place, and the top two? One made this place a couple centuries back and Thirteen&#39;s basically ancient. That being said, I still think at least sending Shard down there is a good option, at least as an ace in the hole for Dr. Coin&#39;s team. Who- by the way, have been sitting ducks for a few days now.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-4 &#34;Blockplan&#34;:** ...with express directions to not do any collateral damage?
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5 &#34;Blackbird&#34;:** With express directions to not do anything collateral at all. You have my word, Four. He gets the die, I hold and process it as an in-Foundation purchase because we have the legal paper for it still, and then I put it back in its neat little box in 18V. I just need a few days to... &#34;pull him out of retirement&#34;, if you will. I&#39;ve expedited half the process and pre-seasoned him with Dr. Morgan&#39;s information as well... and luckily, a certain recently disowned rich kid also filled him in on a few extra things.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-4 &#34;Blockplan&#34;:** Pre-seasoned- Lord Above, why did you use that phrasing...
&gt; 
&gt; //A pause. O5-4 takes a deep breath to quell their agitation.//
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-4 &#34;Blockplan&#34;:** I find this to be... acceptable terms. Efficiency is key in extraction.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-2 &#34;Bureaucracy&#34;&#39;s Adjutant Proxy:** Ser Blockplan, you do not seem satisfied with this.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-4 &#34;Blockplan&#34;:** Aside from... all that, which I&#39;ve just handwaved, the personal involvement with 7000 and Dr. McCallum bothers me a little. I do understand we need as many tychekinetic anomalies out of the public and under our control, but I can&#39;t help but want the pretty box it&#39;ll collect dust in to sit in the McCallum residence and not in a generic metal cabinet because we //have to// have it. As a council member, however, I understand full well that we can&#39;t risk containment first and foremost, as well as the fact that we cannot risk potentially ruining the very legal system I&#39;ve- Bureaucracy and I have been advocating for for decades. I also do acknowledge that there&#39;s extremely little precedent in letting an anomaly be held by Level 0 personnel that aren&#39;t themselves anomalies. It just... isn&#39;t satisfying, the way it is.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5 &#34;Blackbird&#34;:** Hmm. Well, let&#39;s look at it this way: the most extreme peaceful solution is waiting for Mark Kiryu to grow a heart and give the die freely to the McCallums. The other extreme is me pulling both Shard and Singe out of retirement for instant extraction and even //I&#39;m// not that sadistic. Neither of these are ideal, I can&#39;t skew to the latter because neither you nor Two want this to be an incident, can&#39;t skew to the former because that&#39;d be the same as considering it gone.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-4 &#34;Blockplan&#34;:** Yes, and...
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5 &#34;Blackbird&#34;:** I will note here that I watched a few recordings of the DnD campaign at Bureaucracy&#39;s recommendation to get a feel of how socially important it is, and though I still think an object is just an object, I remember when I put out the order to put [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-458 458] in containment. 17 isn&#39;t really known for being... peaceful, which I should have foresaw and am forseeing now with 18V. I&#39;ve seen the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/orientation-for-the-pastaphysics-department Pastaphysics Orientation script] as reference to the emotional worth of comfort to compare.
&gt; 
&gt; Applying that same logic upon the feelings surrounding SCP-7000 to the initial riot that made the Storith City treaty in the first place, I think there&#39;s real and true objective merit in avoiding that kind of uproar. Especially now that it&#39;s public knowledge that we&#39;ve sent people to Storith in general. I spoke to Twelve earlier and she suggested //making the whole &#34;giving back the die to the family&#34; ordeal very obnoxiously public. After all, we can make the family sign that the Foundation can borrow it at any time so effectively it&#39;s contained anyway. We can get psychological with it and have Dr. Coin personally do all this and play up her emotional bond to Dr. McCallum.// Paraphrased. I think all I really need to do is make the legal appeal paper to The Mayor to get things moving. Do clear it when I run it by you later, Four.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-4 &#34;Blockplan&#34;:** You&#39;re unusually pragmatic today... so what do you want in return?
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5 &#34;Blackbird&#34;:** Ye of little faith! I wouldn&#39;t be much of a council member if I only listen to my own voice. Besides, I already have the confirmation I want: you agree that we can just... take the die. And you agree that my method is efficient. You //and// Two agree that the best option is the one that causes the least problems, and I&#39;m your ever-reliable strategist that can put all this together. We&#39;re not really disagreeing since we want the same thing, on top of that.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-2 &#34;Bureaucracy&#34;&#39;s Adjutant Proxy:** Is there anything else to note?
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-4 &#34;Blockplan&#34;:** There is not. I will entrust this move to Blackbird, then. Thank you for being this meeting&#39;s mediator, Proxy.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-2 &#34;Bureaucracy&#34;&#39;s Adjutant Proxy:** You&#39;re welcome, Ser Overseer. Then that is everything needed to be said... at least, for the record. The meeting ends here.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5 &#34;Blackbird&#34;:** Tell Two I said hi.
