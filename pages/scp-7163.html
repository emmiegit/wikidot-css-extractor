[[include component:image-block | name=sandsculpture.jpg | caption=SCP-7163 at location of acquisition.]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7163 is kept on a pedestal and is housed in the Applied Occultism Section. Due to its extreme durability and ability to withstand almost any form of damage, SCP-7163 does not need to be maintained regularly. Whenever its anomalous effects occur, affected personnel must inform the head of Applied Occultism of the exact advice given by SCP-7163. Currently, SCP-7163 is under the supervision of --Dougall Deering-- Udo Okorie.

**Description:** SCP-7163 is a frog sculpture constructed of sand. The frog is depicted sitting on a rock, and its forelegs are crossed. The sculpture is remarkably resistant to nearly all forms of damage, including extreme environmental conditions. SCP-7163 can be preserved for an exceedingly prolonged period of time, potentially indefinitely. Carved into the back of the sculpture is the English sentence “I Will Be Here Whenever You Need Me The Most.”

On a random day every year, SCP-7163 will telepathically speak to a member of Site-43’s staff, and beckon them to visit it. SCP-7163 usually selects staff that are undergoing a situation that is affecting their mental health considerably. Once that member of staff reaches SCP-7163, the anomaly will begin telepathically giving advice to that member of staff that would help solve that staff member’s current situation, and improve their current well-being. When followed, the advice given is very beneficial to help solve these issues, and personnel have reported that their general mental well-being improved significantly after conversing with SCP-7163.

Research is ongoing in order to determine the creator of SCP-7163, and the exact mechanics behind SCP-7163’s telepathy and its advice.

**Addendum 7163.1:** Phenomenological Overview

SCP-7163 was discovered on 1999/03/14 at North Grand Bend Beach when an MTF spotted the anomaly as they were pursuing a loup-garou[[footnote]]French-Canadian werewolves that are frequently spotted in Québec[[/footnote]] that had escaped containment. The loup-garou that they were pursuing attempted to run through the sculpture, however, the sculpture was not broken through, and the creature was impeded long enough for the MTF to recapture it. SCP-7163 was subsequently taken to Site-43.

Three months after its discovery, its primary anomalous capabilities were uncovered when Junior Researcher Ezekiel Hargreaves reported hearing a voice in their head directing them towards the location of the anomaly. After following this voice, it revealed itself to be the sculpture, and it began to give advice to Ezekiel and consoled them about their current familial issues, including the recent passing of a close family member. Ezekiel reluctantly decided to follow its advice, later reporting feeling much better mentally, and that they are slowly beginning to resolve their relationship with their family.

On 2000/10/03, SCP-7163 contacted janitor Martin Whittle, who was suffering from depression at the time. Once Martin finished his conversation with SCP-7163, he decided to go talk to a therapist about his mental health, and was given anti-depressants and ways to help cope with his depression. Martin later confirmed that the advice that SCP-7163 had given helped him make that decision to visit his therapist, and that his depression became much more manageable to deal with. SCP-7163 then went inactive for the second time, and did not become active again until 2001/05/17, when it contacted Junior Researcher Parker Genrikh, who had anxiety troubles after first arriving at Site-43. SCP-7163 then gave Parker advice that would help him stay calm in stressful situations.

The head of Applied Occultism, Dougall Deering, saw this pattern of activity and began to take interest in the anomaly, and commenced research on the anomaly to determine its origin and the exact mechanics of its telepathy. Initial inquiry into the anomaly revealed that the sand used to construct the sculpture dated back to 4000 BCE. The sculpture also emits faint traces of Akiva radiation, suggesting religious association. However, SCP-7163 does not correspond with any other artifact of known deities.

**Addendum 7163.2:** Further Inquiry into SCP-7163

On 2001/11/25, Dougall Deering resumed his research after a hiatus focusing on higher priority projects. For this research, he brought in Researcher Udo Okorie, whose thaumaturgic Talent allows her to manipulate granules of sand, and perform numerous tasks with these granules. Deering began to perform multiple experiments with Okorie to determine clues about SCP-7163, its properties, and its origins.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

//Footage captures SCP-7163’s containment chamber. The sculpture is sitting on a pedestal in the center of the chamber.//

//Deering and Okorie enter the chamber.//

**Deering:** Here we are.

//Deering steps closer to the sculpture, and makes his way next to the pedestal and turns around.//

**Deering:** Alright. So, Udo, today we are going to work on a project that I had to put off for a while, but now that we’re beginning to expand the capabilities of your Talent, I feel like we can finally make progress. And it’s all because of //this//.

//Dougall rests his shoulder around the sculpture and taps it on the side of its head.//

**Okorie:** A frog sculpture?

**Deering:** Yes, but not just any sculpture. This anomaly right here has been quite the peculiarity for my team and I. On a random day two years ago, it spoke to one of our junior researchers directly in their head, and they were on the other side of the site at the time, mind you. It told them a lot of information about their relationship with their family, which only they knew about, and asked them to walk right into its chamber so that it could supposedly help them.

**Okorie:** Did they go up to it?

**Deering:** They did, yes. And I can see why they did. It would be terrifying to find out that something out there knows everything about you, even information that’s meant to be kept secret. 

**Okorie:** Like all the projects you keep up there?

//Okorie taps the side of her head.//

**Deering:** Most definitely. There are some projects of mine that I don’t want getting into the wrong hands. Especially the ones that matter. I can’t afford to lose those.

//Deering looks up at Okorie for a second, before looking back at the sculpture.//

**Deering:** But that’s not the point. Once the researcher entered this anomaly’s chamber, it began to start giving out advice to help this researcher deal with issues that they had with their family. They didn’t think this advice would be effective, I didn’t either when they told me about it, but they did eventually follow the advice, and it worked! The advice helped this researcher push through uncharted waters, and helped them make amends with their family, just like that.

**Okorie:** That could make an effective therapist.

**Deering:** If it started being more active, maybe Anoki could use an assistant from time to time. But it only ever became active twice more since, with each occurring on two separate years. We tried several directions to see what this sculpture could represent and where it came from, but those all came up as dead ends. I only got one more chance to finally figure this all out, so we can use this anomaly for the benefit of our personnel. And that’s where you come in.

**Deering:** Since you’re starting to unlock your fullest potential, I thought it would be good to take on a little side project, just for fun. Maybe we can try exploring some other pathways that your Talent can cross. There are so many things that we can do with it, but it requires a lot of focus. And we can start with one, for now. From when you were younger.

**Okorie:** Is this the thing I told you about when I was nine?

**Deering:** Yes. When you were at the beach with your family.

**Okorie:** Look, that was just a one-time thing. I didn’t even know how I did it. I thought it was just my imagination.

**Deering:** But it did happen. You focused on what you wanted to see, to feel right there in the sand, and you saw something.

**Okorie:** I guess I saw impressions of something. Flashes of events that the sand experienced, that it felt. I think I even saw the beach when it was first formed. But when I started looking for too long, I got a severe headache, and I had to stop.

**Deering:** But it did work. And now we can do it again. Because you have the reins, now. You can control it.

**Okorie:** I don’t know if I can do it again. It’s been years.

**Deering:** It has, but I think you can tap in there again. You have the potential, you just need to focus on what you want to see. Just breathe, and focus.

**Okorie:** Alright. I’ll try.

//Okorie begins to pull out a bag full of sand, however she is stopped by Deering.//

**Deering:** I don’t think you need those.

**Okorie:** Are you saying that I shouldn’t use my reagents? You know I can’t use my magic with just my bare hands.

**Deering:** But you did, didn’t you? You didn’t have those reagents when you were nine. But you still pushed through, and found what you wanted. I think you can do it again.

**Okorie:** Are you sure about this?

**Deering:** I am. I think you’ll find what you need.

**Deering:** Let’s see how deep this connection goes.

//Okorie slowly steps forward towards SCP-7163, and reaches out to touch it. She closes her eyes and begins to focus.//

**Deering:** Do you feel anything?

**Okorie:** Yes! I can feel… something. I don’t know what. There’s something in here, and it’s moving around. I think it’s- Oh, it went away.

**Deering:** That’s interesting. See if you can try to push closer.

**Okorie:** Okay, I will.

//Okorie grabs the sculpture from its pedestal and holds onto it, feeling around it as if searching for something.//

**Deering:** If you aren’t finding anything else of note, we can try again tomorrow.

**Okorie:** No, it’s fine, I’ll keep looking. I’ll find something eve- Ow, shit!

//Okorie drops the sculpture and begins to clutch her forehead in pain. The sculpture remains intact. Deering rushes to check on the sculpture, making sure that it’s intact, before rushing to Okorie’s side.//

**Deering:** Udo! Can you hear me? Are you alright? Udo?

**Udo:** It hurts. It //hurts//.

//Okorie then collapses onto the floor. Deering crouches down to check on her before standing and turning away from her.//

**Deering:** I’m going to call Health and Pathology, get some help. You’ll be alright. It’s all going to be alright.

//Deering reaches for the emergency phone line and begins to dial to reach Health and Pathology. Just as he places the phone to his ears, Udo lets out a scream and releases her hands from her ears. The pain begins to subside.//

**Okorie:** Dougall…

**Deering:** This is Deering. We have an emergency. One of my researchers-

**Okorie:** Dougall!

**Deering:** Udo? Hang on for just a second.

//Deering rushes back over to Udo and helps her stand.//

**Deering:** Are you alright?

**Okorie:** I feel fine. It only hurt for a little bit.

**Deering:** At least the sculpture is intact. Who knows what would’ve happened if it shattered when you dropped it. I would’ve lost all the progress I made for my research in just seconds. 

**Deering:** We can work on something else tomorrow, take a little break. 

**Okorie:** I did find a few things, from the sand. It was just flashes again, but I did glean a few things when I touched the sculpture.

**Deering:** What did you see?

**Okorie:** Okay. This was a doozy, but- Ow! It’s still burning in my brain.

**Deering:** It’s still fresh in your mind.

**Okorie:** Yeah, I can see it clearly. There were flames, lots of flames. A huge, raging fire that just kept on burning. Then I found myself falling through the floor, a straight freefall down past many stars. I saw entire constellations whirl around me, constantly and without ever slowing down. Then I landed in darkness, flat on my face, right into the void. I looked up, and I saw something in the distance. Some kind of entity.

**Deering:** What did this entity look like?

**Okorie:** It was too blurry to make out at first, but I do know it was a very bright white. It hurt my eyes just seeing it. It looked human, but I couldn’t make out any features beyond that. And I tried to crawl towards it, but then it reached out its hand, and I was brought back here.

**Deering:** And you experienced all of that in thirty seconds?

**Okorie:** That was only thirty seconds? Felt a lot longer than that.

**Deering:** Hm. That’s interesting. I’m glad that you did manage to find a few crumbs of information, but this is leaving me with more questions than answers.

**Okorie:** I’m sorry that I couldn’t maintain my focus for longer. I could’ve looked for more information, more hints.

**Deering:** You did the best you could. You don’t have anything to apologize for. You did great today, Udo. I’m proud of your progress so far.

**Okorie:** Thank you, Dougall.

**Deering:** No, thank you, for being such a big help.

**Deering:** This concludes our experiment for today. Udo, if you may.

**Okorie:** Oh, yeah, that’s right.

//Okorie picks the sculpture back up and returns it to Dougall, who places it on the pedestal. Dougall motions for Udo to follow him, and they both start to exit the chamber.//

**Deering:** We’re going to do great things together. I just know it.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Addendum 7163.3:** Incident 7163.1

On 2002/09/08, the following incident took place near SCP-7163’s containment chamber. At 16:45, Dougall Deering was seen walking towards SCP-7163’s containment chamber. It is presumed that SCP-7163 contacted Deering to enter its chamber. The following incident occurred directly after this event.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

//Dougall Deering enters the chamber. He closes the door behind him, and heads toward the center of the chamber.//

**Deering:** It’s been a while.

//No verbal response from SCP-7163. Deering tilts his head slightly, indicating that he is reacting to SCP-7163, and it is speaking telepathically.//

**Deering:** I see you’re not willing to spill secrets. That’s alright. I now have a chance to finally speak with you, after all this time.

**Deering:** So, tell me. Why did you bring me here, to you? Why are you active for only a single day every year?

//There is silence. The next five minutes are spent in this silence, with Deering staring at SCP-7163. Suddenly, Deering takes a step back, expressing confusion.//

**Deering:** //What//?

//Deering steps even closer to SCP-7163, inches away from its face. Another three minutes pass. Dougall then steps back, looks up at the ceiling, and begins to ponder about something.//

**Deering:** Well, that does make sense. But why?

//Deering stares at the sculpture for another two minutes, before nodding and placing his hands in his pockets.//

**Deering:** Before I go, I’d like to thank you for helping me, whoever you are. I still have many questions, but I think I’ll save those for another time. Besides, you have to go through a lot more people here before you get to me, anyway.

**Deering:** I’ll be going, now. It’s been an enlightening experience, that’s for sure.

//Deering heads for the chamber doors, and exits the chamber, closing the doors behind him.//

//Deering walks throughout all of the Applied Occultism Section, and starts to work on many minute chores, whistling as he does so.//

//Once he completes these chores, he enters one of the hallways that criss-crosses the Section, still whistling as he walks through. Once he passes Okorie’s chamber, he glances at it for a few seconds, and smiles before continuing to head through the hallway.//

//As he makes his way through the hallway, he suddenly stops, turning his head to one side as though he was hearing something, and then mumbles a single word before his eyes roll back in his head as blood fills the sockets, and he falls to the floor at a bad angle, snapping his neck.//[[footnote]]After further review, this sudden death was confirmed to be caused by complications from [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5243 a separate anomaly].[[/footnote]]

//The body of Dougall Deering was not discovered until a few hours after these events occurred, where Researcher Okorie stumbled upon his body after sealing a containment cell. Security and Containment personnel arrived to see Okorie sitting against the wall, pulling her legs up against her chest and sobbing, and staring at the body of Dougall Deering.//

//After these events, nothing of interest occurred until two days after, on 2002/09/10 at 2:30 hours, when motion was detected inside SCP-7163’s chamber. Camera footage shows Okorie standing in the doorway to the chamber proper, staring at SCP-7163 in the dark.//

**Okorie:** What did you tell him?

//There is no response.//

**Okorie:** What did you //tell him//?

//No response.//

**Okorie:** It doesn’t make sense. It couldn’t be you because that’s not what you do. You don’t telepathically send someone a kill agent, you give them advice. You help them. But I need answers. That’s the only thing that matters now. What did you tell him?

//No response.//

**Okorie:** It can’t be you. But it might be you. I don’t know. Why won’t you tell me? What did he say to you? Before he- left me. What did he say?

//No response.//

**Okorie:** You’ve got to help me. Please. I need to know. Please.

//There is silence. Udo waits for a moment, then begins to step closer to the sculpture, placing her hand on its forehead. She closes her eyes, and stands in this position for a moment. Nothing of significance occurs during this period. She then opens her eyes, and turns away from the sculpture. She leaves the chamber, close the doors behind her, and does not look back.//

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Addendum 7163.4:** Counseling Log 7163.1

The following is a transcript of a mandatory check-in session between clinical psychiatrist Dr. Nhung Ngo and Udo Okorie that took place on 2012/09/09. Before this session took place, there have been no new major discoveries pertaining to SCP-7163 and its origins. A section of this session contains information about the investigation behind SCP-7163, and what Researcher Okorie had been doing to investigate this anomaly.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Ngo:** I’m very pleased that you could make this session today, Udo! 

**Okorie:** Yeah, I managed to find a time that would work for today.

//Okorie is seen in Ngo’s office, sitting on a desk chair. Ngo can be seen with a clipboard on her lap and a pen in her hand.//

**Ngo:** I get it, you’re busy with all your projects. But today I thought you would be with your colleagues, at-

**Okorie:** The remembrance events. I know, for the anniversary.

**Ngo:** Ten years.

**Okorie:** Only ever felt like 10 months. Especially considering I missed thirty percent of all that.

**Ngo:** I never thought that we’d have to deal with an annual magic gunk explosion and have to take that seriously, but I guess that’s just what life is for us now. We have to deal with it. We can’t undo it, or reverse it. We just have to keep on moving.

**Okorie:** I guess so.

**Ngo:** Back on topic, I brought you in here so that I can check in on you, see how you’re feeling after all this time. 

**Okorie:** I feel fine. Just swell.

**Ngo:** I’m sure you are. I have a few questions to ask you. First of all, you’re still working while everyone else is off the clock. Why is that?

**Okorie:** I’m just busy. Got a lot of projects to work on.

**Ngo:** Do you spend any time to, I don’t know, take a break? Go out with friends? Go to the movies?

**Okorie:** Sometimes.

**Ngo:** That’s good to know. But you have been particularly busy as of late. And I don’t think it’s just because of every project that you have to do under the sun. No, I think it’s because of something else. A project that you personally wish to complete. And here’s my question: what kind of project has to make you spend all that time on completing instead of taking time off?

**Okorie:** It’s not important.

**Ngo:** I think it is. For you specifically. It’s your pet project.

**Okorie:** No, it’s his. Or, was his.

**Ngo:** Can you elaborate on that?

**Okorie:** There’s a project that Dougall used to work on constantly. It was one of the first projects I ever worked on. It’s still unfinished. We never got any concrete answers.

**Ngo:** What kind of project?

**Okorie:** It’s a frog sculpture. Constructed from sand, that’s why he brought me in. We were trying to find information on where it came from, and examine how its anomalous properties functioned.

**Ngo:** It was Dougall’s, and now it’s yours. Are you continuing to experiment on this anomaly to finish what he started? In his memory, perhaps?

**Okorie:** He’s a body that drops right onto the floor at 5:18 in the afternoon, every year. I don’t even know what I’m commemorating anymore. He’s just a memory, now.

**Okorie:** But that sculpture’s been sitting there for the longest time, and sometimes when I go past it I feel like it’s staring at me, like it’s waiting for me specifically, somehow. I don’t know. But I don’t want it to go to waste regardless.

**Ngo:** It’s not going to go to waste. Maybe you just need to wait for the right time for it to become active again.

**Okorie:** That can only happen if I am at my lowest. SCP-7163 only goes active to give advice to our staff when they’re at rock bottom, and then it goes silent again for another year. And it’s entirely random. I don’t know if it will ever speak to me.

**Ngo:** Well then, if it’s not going to crack, why are you still trying to open it?

**Okorie:** Because I need to get it done. This sculpture was one of my first projects, and it’s just been sitting there collecting dust. If I can’t even solve something as simple as a safe class object from ten years ago, what does that mean for me? I don’t know, it just feels like I’m not trying hard enough.

**Ngo:** You’re doing the best you can. You’re a very talented thaumaturgist, and I don’t believe that a simple sculpture is going to change that.

**Okorie:** I have been using my talent, as well. I’ve been feeling the sand to try and replicate what I did, but it’s not letting me show what I want. It’s been giving me nearly the exact same vision every time. I’m not getting any answers.

**Ngo:** I think you need to take some time off from this. Clear your head, take a break, go have fun with your friends. Once your mind is cleared of the stress, maybe you can look at this from a different perspective. There’s all kinds of answers, waiting in different directions. Even if there are setbacks, you can make the best of those setbacks and still keep on going. All you have to do is move forward. 

**Okorie:** But what if there aren’t any directions to go off of?

**Ngo:** Then make your own and stick with it. Just try. You’ll never know what you might find if you don’t try.

**Okorie:** I’ll think about it. 

**Ngo:** You’ll be alright.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Addendum 7163.5:** Interview 7163.1

The following is a transcript of an interview between Chief Delfina Ibanez and SCP-7163 on 2021/11/30. This interview was made possible through the usage of Telescribe[[footnote]]Technology used for digitally transcribing telepathic conversations between two individuals, using technology derived from [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2922 SCP-2922].[[/footnote]] technology. This interview was established to further understand SCP-7163’s capabilities, and to determine the creator of the anomaly. Chief Ibanez was contacted by SCP-7163, and once she reached its chamber she conducted an impromptu interview, which has been transcribed below.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Interviewed:** SCP-7163

**Interviewer:** Delfina Ibanez

----

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

//Chief Delfina Ibanez enters the room, dragging a chair into the room. She places the chair in front of SCP-7163’s pedestal, and sits down.//

**Ibanez:** Afternoon. Let’s get to the point. You’re going to try and cheer me up, give me some words of wisdom, tell me that’s it all going to be okay, and then send me on my merry way. Is that correct?

**SCP-7163:** This is not a consolation, Delfina. I can see that you are not looking for that right now. This is more of a discussion.

**Ibanez:** I know that this isn’t a consolation, because I know that she’s not dead.

**SCP-7163:** Do you? 

**Ibanez:** She can’t be dead. She can’t be. There might be an overwhelming amount of evidence against this, but she’s not dead.

**SCP-7163:** And why do you think this is the case?

**Ibanez:** Look, pal, we were in Alagadda, trying to fix everything, save the world, stop the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6500 Impasse], and lo and behold the fucking Hanged King himself decided to come down and say hi. There was literally no chance that she could have survived against him, but she faced him anyway. She gave her life to save us. To save the world. To save //me//.

**SCP-7163:** But you think she’s still alive.

**Ibanez:** She has to be. She has to.

**SCP-7163:** You’re conflicted. I get it. Your planet has endured a great deal of hardship this year. But all of this stagnation will end soon, won’t it? She did that for you. So that all the beauty of this planet could see the light of day again. 

**Ibanez:** I know. But it doesn’t feel right.

**Ibanez:** I haven’t gone to the funeral. I didn’t sign the papers. Everyone else is talking about her. Telling stories about the time they had with her. Like she was a memory now. I can’t have that.

**SCP-7163:** Maybe she is a memory. Maybe she isn’t. What do you want to do about it? Are you going to move on, or stand your ground and hope that she’s still out there?

**Ibanez:** I’m not the type to just sit around and wait. I’m heading back to hell city tomorrow.

**SCP-7163:** That’s a very bold move.

**Ibanez:** I know she’s out there. I’m going to find her.

**SCP-7163:** I wish you good luck on your journey, then.

**Ibanez:** You’re not going to tell me otherwise?

**SCP-7163:** The easiest option would be for you to follow everyone else’s footsteps, and take your time to grieve. But that’s not what you want. You have faith in her. You have a certain kind of fire, one that does not go out easily. You listen to what your heart tells you, and then you follow that path. I think it might be better for you to, just this once, listen to it. Follow it, see where it leads you. You might find your friend, you might not, but I think there’s a good chance that you will.

//There is a short pause.//

**Ibanez:** I did not expect that. Thanks, whoever you are.

**SCP-7163:** What’s your next course of action?

**Ibanez:** Well, I was supposed to get some information out of you, and then afterwards I’m heading out to 19, got some planning to do. 

**SCP-7163:** Right now, I’m not really sure that I have much to give you.

**Ibanez:** Why’s that? 

**SCP-7163:** I can’t let it be known who I truly am. That would create a little bit of an issue for your superiors.

**Ibanez:** Well, can you at least explain why your advice is so effective? How do you know our personnel so well that you can solve their problems with just a few words?

**SCP-7163:** I can shed some light into that.

**SCP-7163:** I do not have the ability to see all of history, through the past and future. But I can see people. I can see character, wants and desires, flaws, and the qualities that make people unique from one another. I take all of that, their past experiences, and what they want for their future, and I give them advice that specifically helps them achieve their goals. I want to give them hope for their future, make them see what I see in them.

**Ibanez:** You do want to genuinely help people.

**SCP-7163:** Yes. All living beings are sacred, but humans? They are one of the most fascinating species that I’ve ever got to know. You have advanced so far in technology since I last saw this planet. Even in the past two decades, your technologies have advanced considerably. I think you should be proud of that.

**Ibanez:** Sure, but there are a lot of things about us that I don’t think you would like.

**SCP-7163:** Yes. Humanity does have the capability to commit heinous acts in the name of what people think is right. But you still have the capacity for love and kindness. It might not feel like it, but there are people out there who do have compassion, empathy, and generosity for others. That’s what makes you stand out. Those are the qualities of your species that cannot die out.

**Ibanez:** How long have you been away from this planet? Because right now, we’re at a losing game with that.

**SCP-7163:** I have been watching your planet as of recently, and yes, it does seem as if the evils of this world are turning the tides, but I still have hope that no matter what happens, good will triumph. Just like your hope for your friend. All we can do is take action, and hope for the best.

**SCP-7163:** I do wish you good luck on whatever path you decide to take. You will find her. And once you do, say hi to her for me. I have a lot to discuss with Udo. But that’s for another time.

//The voice goes silent. Ibanez is left sitting in the chamber. After a short pause she nods, stands up, picks up the chair, and moves to exit the chamber.//

**Addendum 7163.6:** Interview 7163.2

The following is a transcript of an interview between Dr. Okorie and SCP-7163 on 2022/12/15. This interview reveals a few important pieces of information about the creator of SCP-7163, and details about the exact purpose behind the object.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Interviewed:** SCP-7163

**Interviewer:** Udo Okorie

----

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

//Dr. Okorie enters the chamber. She closes the chamber doors behind her, and stands directly in front of SCP-7163.//

**Okorie:** Are you going to say anything?

//There is a short pause, before SCP-7163 finally speaks.//

**SCP-7163:** For what it’s worth, I do apologize for shutting the door on you, after all this time.

**Okorie:** At least you’re here, now. But why now? 

**SCP-7163:** I wanted to talk to you about a few things.

**SCP-7163:** For starters, your former supervisor. My condolences for what happened to him. I wish I was there to help you, after his passing. But I could not, unfortunately.

**Okorie:** I thought I would never feel as happy as I did with him ever again, but I still pushed through. I can’t give up on the things that I still have, even if I lose something great.

**SCP-7163:** Do you still wish to know what I told him?

**Okorie:** I don’t think it matters, at this point. That was something that he needed at the time, not me.

**SCP-7163:** It has been a while since I last remember my interaction with him, but I think I recall something about his brother. The details are getting lost on me.

**SCP-7163:** But that’s not the only thing I’m here to discuss with you. There was quite a revelation that you had about a year ago. And another loss of someone very close to you.

**Okorie:** I thought it would end with Dougall. But I couldn’t do anything about it. It was out of my control.

**SCP-7163:** Sometimes things have to end. And sometimes, they end on the spur of a moment, without your knowledge, without even a chance to say goodbye. But your dad passed knowing that you’ll stay strong. You’ll keep your head up. And he got to spend every last second with someone he loved. I bet that was good enough for him.

**Okorie:** It’s still hard, without him. It’s just me and mom now, and it doesn’t feel the same.

**SCP-7163:** It won’t ever be the same. But you’ll still push through. You’ll remember all the good times that you had with him, and you’ll keep your head up, for a brighter future.

**Okorie:** Before we separated on Corbenic, he told me something that he was keeping from me, for the longest time. That I’m not human. 

**SCP-7163:** Another woman, one not from Earth.

**Okorie:** He met her in Alagadda, but I don’t believe that she’s from there. I don’t know. I’ve been researching to find out who this woman really is, but I’ve got nothing so far.

**SCP-7163:** Does your Foundation know about this?

**Okorie:** Yes. They haven’t put me in a cage, and I’m still able to work, but this whole thing has still been wracking my brain.

**Okorie:** When I place my hand on this sculpture, I can feel what it feels. I can see impressions of events in the past, from what this sculpture saw. I never knew how I did it. And I did it with my bare hands. I never did anything without my reagents before then. But now it’s starting to make more sense.

**SCP-7163:** It’s truly wonderful, the talents that you wield.

**Okorie:** But I don’t know what I am now. I don’t know who this woman is, what her people are, what any of this means. 

**SCP-7163:** Regardless of where you came from, you’re still you. You’re Udo Okorie. You have friends to support you, and just because you’re only half-human, does not make you any lesser than what you thought you were before. 

**Okorie:** I still don’t know what I’m truly capable of.

**SCP-7163:** You can start experimenting. One last project, to mark a new era.

**Okorie:** Me.

**SCP-7163:** I have faith that you will find what you’re looking for.

**Okorie:** I hope you’re right. 

**Okorie:** But for now, I need to address the elephant in the room.

**SCP-7163:** This sculpture is more of the amphibian type.

**Okorie:** I’m not talking about the sculpture. I’m talking about what’s inside it.

**SCP-7163:** Ah, of course. 

**Okorie:** I have a few notions of what you’re supposed to be, but I think it’d be better if I got to confirm it from the source.

**SCP-7163:** Very well then. I’m not going to give you the full picture, but I bet you’ll put the pieces together in time.

**Okorie:** I’ve spent twenty years for this. You should at least give me something that isn’t a vague vision.

**SCP-7163:** I’ll make sure that your time won’t be wasted.

**SCP-7163:** Before I left your planet, I buried this sculpture right at the area where you would find it. Near your site. Once the time came, I moved it up to where you could see it.

**Okorie:** You wanted us to contain the sculpture.

**SCP-7163:** Correct.

**Okorie:** Why?

**SCP-7163:** So that the people in this site could have hope. So that no matter what, they’ll keep standing to fight for what they love.

**SCP-7163:** Your Foundation does not respect the life that it contains. It takes life. It pokes and it prods at it, so that the world outside will not be able to experience all that hides under the floorboards, and in every nook and cranny. But it only takes a single match to start a fire. There’s always a chance to turn things around, for the better.

**Okorie:** You’re on the side of change.

**SCP-7163:** I am on the side of every living being, on every planet, and in every star system. I am on the side of hope, so that every fire can stay alight, so that people like you, Udo, can bring change to the world. 

**Okorie:** But you kept yourself in this sculpture, just to help us. You never came out of where you’re hiding at. 

**SCP-7163:** I was unable to help your planet for the longest time. I left to help others who needed my guidance, and it’s been millennia since. Everything’s changed. I’ve seen your species grow in so many wonderful ways, but I’ve seen many terrible things as well. Things I could have prevented. 

**Okorie:** You had too much on your plate. It was out of your control. But that’s okay.

**SCP-7163:** Because some things have to change.

**Okorie:** And when they do, you keep moving. You have to keep trying.

**SCP-7163:** Now you are beginning to understand. 

**Okorie:** I’ve got a long way to go before that.

**SCP-7163:** You’ll get there.

**Okorie:** I’m still thinking about why you still need to hide.

**SCP-7163:** I don&#39;t know if I should reveal myself this soon. Nothing good would come of that. I do not wish to cause more mayhem than what has already been brought upon your planet.

**Okorie:** Then we can start slowly. Maybe we can help each other.

**SCP-7163:** Are you suggesting that I should help your Foundation?

**Okorie:** Not the wider Foundation. I was thinking back to what you said. You said you wanted to help our site specifically. So that we can change for the better.

**SCP-7163:** I doubt the entire Foundation could change their ways completely. You almost took the right path, when you had that fateful vote, but it only took one Council member to kill any last hope that the entire system will change itself. I just want things to be better, for your subjects in containment, for all the deviations of this planet that you lock away, and for all walks of life. These beings all deserve to live. 

**SCP-7163:** I doubt I can interfere more than I already have. But I can help you succeed. You can start the fire that will change the world for the better, so that others can follow your stead, and take charge to fight for what’s right.

**Okorie:** I still have doubts on that, but I’ll try.

**SCP-7163:** You can start with finishing what you started.

**Okorie:** Are you saying-

**SCP-7163:** The visions. Yes. I intentionally blocked those out, so my identity could remain a secret. But I think you should have at least a bit of closure to this story.

**Okorie:** Alright. Thank you.

//Okorie steps closer to the sculpture, placing her hand on the top of the sculpture’s head, and closing her eyes. Fifteen seconds pass before she opens her eyes once more, and takes a step back in shock.//

**Okorie:** So it was you.

**SCP-7163:** Correct.

**Okorie:** This entire time, it was- Wow. How did I not figure this out sooner?

**SCP-7163:** I thought the hints I gave were very clear on who I am.

**Okorie:** Well, that’s going to be a lot to think about.

**SCP-7163:** At least your project is finally complete. That’s something to celebrate, is it not?

**Okorie:** Yeah, I’m glad it’s done, at least.

**SCP-7163:** The first step for change is always the hardest, but when it is done it does pay off to what comes next.

**SCP-7163:** One more thing before you go. I’ve had this on my mind for a while. How is Ezekiel?

**Okorie:** They’re doing alright, last time I spoke to them. They transferred to another site, and are now a senior researcher, last time I checked. They seem happy.

**SCP-7163:** That’s good. We had a wonderful conversation. I’m glad they’re living their best life, now.

**SCP-7163:** It’s been nice knowing you, Udo.

**Okorie:** See you next year?

**SCP-7163:** I will always be here. For you, and all of these wonderful people.

**SCP-7163:** Have a Merry Christmas, and happy holidays.

//Okorie turns around, and leaves the room. Just as she closes the chamber door behind her, SCP-7163 speaks once more, to no one in particular.//

**SCP-7163:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/pangloss#pages Will wonders ever cease?]
