&gt; I hated you.
&gt; 
&gt; I can count every meaningful conversation we ever had on my digits.  What I can&#39;t count is the number of times they told me how important you were.  Government scientist.  Indispensable.  Fearless.  Peerless.  But it&#39;s funny that they could never tell me what exactly you did.
&gt; 
&gt; It&#39;s so much funnier now.
&gt; 
&gt; My family, our friends, mother&#39;s friends-//your// friends, they had no idea, but you were here the entire time.  Not that I blame you for that, you couldn&#39;t come home and tell your family you looked after nightmares.  Nightmares you sent people to their death to, by the way.  No shame in it, so have I-it&#39;s the job.  But the cover story they (or maybe you made it yourself?) had for you, people thought your shit couldn&#39;t smell sweeter, huh?  None of us were any the wiser.
&gt; 
&gt; But now I know everything, and it turns out I&#39;ve followed in your footsteps, a fact which repulses me.  Level 4 Clearance!  Site Director!  Just like you!  You must be so proud!  But then you died.  That&#39;s the only reason I find this course of events tolerable, because there&#39;s something different.  I survived, like you couldn&#39;t.  I&#39;m just like you, but I lived.  I can tolerate my memories of you because of this.  Nobody expected me to live up to your example, I was never //anything// compared to you.  But I&#39;m better than you.  Nobody knows though.  Don&#39;t you love the irony?  Is that irony?  I hope it is.
&gt; 
&gt; I hated you, dad.
&gt; 
&gt; Why did you leave me to this shit.
&gt; 
&gt; Everyone jokes about it, like &#34;Hey, Charles, how many Keters did you find for us today?&#34; and I laugh it off.  It&#39;s not funny.  It&#39;s not fucking funny!  We&#39;re so used to it, I&#39;m so used to it, radioactive birds, fountains haunted by dead kids, a fucking fetus controlling a nuclear defense system!  I hate this place, I hate this world, and you left me here to deal with it all by myself!  I fucking hate you!
&gt; 
&gt; I just...
&gt; 
&gt; ...I miss you...dad.

An old man in a suit looked over his computer, watching the video playing on his screen.  &#34;Site-59 Security Footage&#34; was displayed in the corner.  A younger man entered the hallway in the footage.  He was in his mid-thirties, with blonde hair tied back in a ponytail, and limping upon a crutch under his right arm.  The old man stared at the younger man on the screen, the tired eyes racing with memories, thoughts, doubts.

&#34;Brian?&#34;

A second man, also elderly and donning a suit stood in the doorway, looking at the other.  &#34;The other eleven are assembled.&#34;

&#34;Yes, I&#39;ll be there presently.&#34; responded Brian.

The second man walked over to the desk where Brian sat.  &#34;Watching him again?&#34; he said, gazing at the screen.

Brian nodded.  &#34;Every morning I wake up wondering if he&#39;s even still alive.&#34; he said quietly and bitterly.

&#34;You could have stopped him from joining.&#34;

&#34;I know.&#34;

&#34;You didn&#39;t want him to join, did you?&#34;

&#34;No, I did not.&#34;

&#34;Then why did you-&#34;

&#34;Because...I&#39;ve directed his life enough.&#34;  Brian turned in his chair to face his colleague.  &#34;He&#39;s been competing with me every day of his life, and nothing I can do will change that.  I made things the way they are for him, whether I wanted to or not.  He perceives me as an obstacle in his self-actualization.  As much as it pained me, tortured me, terrified me, I couldn&#39;t interfere with his decision to join the Foundation, because I&#39;ve held him back for long enough.&#34;

He bowed his head.  &#34;Even so, he&#39;s still mandating his life by his perception of me, and I can&#39;t even tell him myself.&#34;

&#34;Tell him what?&#34;

&#34;How proud of him I am.&#34;

Brian turned off the screen.</textarea></pre>
