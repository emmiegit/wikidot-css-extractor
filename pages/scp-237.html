**Item #:** SCP-237

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The recovered components of SCP-237-1 have been individually shrink-wrapped, and are to be stored separately; laser grids are established around each component to detect any incipient signs of activity.

The individual instances of SCP-237-2 are contained in separate proportionately-reduced humanoid containment cells, with supervised interaction between instances being permitted contingent on good behavior. Personnel supervising interaction between instances of SCP-237-2 are required to be fluent in spoken Japanese; all interactions are to be recorded and filmed. 

Instances of SCP-237-2 will periodically request supplies of resin and clay with which to repair damage to themselves; to de-incentivize self-harm and prevent stockpiling, these requests are to be fulfilled no more often than once a month, and any supplies not used in repairing damage are to be removed.

Standard data-mining bots have been introduced into the law-enforcement IT infrastructure throughout the Kansai region of Japan, to maintain surveillance for uncontained instances of SCP-237-2. Standard Internet-monitoring bots have been set to watch video-sharing sites for further copies of SCP-237-1&#39;s videos; all such copies are to be taken down via Prenda protocols.

**Description:** SCP-237 is the collective designation of the physical remains of SCP-237-1, and of the set of instances of SCP-237-2 which it created. Prior to being taken into Foundation custody, SCP-237-1 appeared to be a human male of Japanese ethnicity, with falsified identity documents indicating an age of 24 years. It manifested the anomalous ability to endow instances of SCP-237-2 with sapience, sensoria, and independent mobility.

The 16 instances of SCP-237-2 are clay-and-polyurethane statuettes which were anomalously given awareness, sight, hearing, and independent mobility by SCP-237-1. 14 of the instances have displayed the ability to speak Japanese; of these 14, 3 have also displayed the ability to speak English.[[footnote]]While the massive time gap precludes a direct connection, similarities with [[[SCP-2101]]] suggest that these anomalies may descend from the same anomalous sculpting tradition.[[/footnote]]

While being transported to Site-12 for long-term containment, SCP-237-1 abruptly collapsed into several dozen disconnected slabs of clay and polyurethane resin, similar in composition to the instances of SCP-237-2; however, where the resin-and-clay mixture in instances of SCP-237-2 is homogeneous and featureless, in SCP-237-1 the mixture is shaped into replica human organs that are accurate to the sub-millimeter level.

The psychological profiles of the SCP-237-2 instances are similar to a statistically improbable degree; however, rather than being a further indication of anomaly, this is believed to be a result of their common origin.

**Acquisition Log:** SCP-237-1 was discovered after it uploaded several videos to the video-sharing site [REDACTED].jp, in which it demonstrated its anomaly.  A mobile task force was dispatched to its residence, where it was taken into custody along with the instances of SCP-237-2.

**Excerpt from interview log 237-411QL; interview subject: SCP-237-2-9, &#34;Penguin&#34;:**

&gt; **SCP-237-2-9:**  I don&#39;t know, maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m not human -- well, human//oid// -- but I think I have a clearer view of our situation than the others.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gladstone:** Oh?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-237-2-9:** They&#39;re still waiting for him to come back for us. They&#39;re expecting him to rescue us, free us, repair us... all that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gladstone:** And you aren&#39;t?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-237-2-9:** Look. I loved him as much as the rest of them. But you&#39;ve had us here for... what, three years?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gladstone:** Four, next month.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-237-2-9:** Nearly four years. And he hasn&#39;t tried //anything//. No raids, no infiltration... nothing. And I can&#39;t believe he&#39;d just abandon us. At first I thought it was just because he was your prisoner --
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gladstone:** I can&#39;t confirm or deny that.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-237-2-9**: Doctor. We //know// you caught him. We //saw// you catch him, that first day, before you caught //us//. It&#39;s just that most of the others think he escaped somehow. And Office [SCP-237-2-8] and Skinny [SCP-237-2-6] think that what you caught was a decoy.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gladstone:** But you don&#39;t believe that?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-237-2-9:** Oh, no, no, no. I //wish// I believed he was smart enough to make a decoy. But he... well. I suppose he wasn&#39;t //stupid//, otherwise I wouldn&#39;t be smart, but I suppose he was... nave?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gladstone:** &#34;Naive&#34;. It&#39;s from the French.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-237-2-9:** Ah, thank you. Naive. That&#39;s what he was, yes. And now... &lt;sighs&gt; ...now he&#39;s dead. Isn&#39;t he.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gladstone:** Again, I can&#39;t --
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-237-2-9:** -- can&#39;t confirm or deny, right. Honestly, though, it&#39;s the only explanation that makes sense. You let us see each other, but not him? You let us -- them -- have clay for repairs, but we have to do it ourselves instead of having him do it? He&#39;s dead. I... I hope he didn&#39;t suffer.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gladstone:** I can&#39;t comment on that. I&#39;m really, really sorry. You understand.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-237-2-9:** Yeah. Yeah, I do. Honestly, we&#39;re probably better off with you than with him.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gladstone:** How so?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-237-2-9:** You saw his videos. You saw how quickly he could make us. 	
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Gladstone:** Yes...
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-237-2-9:** So why aren&#39;t there more of us?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gladstone:** I don&#39;t--
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-237-2-9:** There //were// more of us, but he unmade them. He kept getting bored with us, or unsatisfied... dissatisfied?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gladstone:** Ah, I believe either word will do here.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-237-2-9:** He kept being dissatisfied with us. And when he got dissatisfied with one of us, he&#39;d mash them down into the goop, and then start over. That&#39;s what happened to Dog, and Clown, and Nun, and Princess... they&#39;re just gone. You realize Baby [SCP-237-2-5] is the //third// Baby? The first one was a girl, but then he said he felt bad about putting so much detail into the parts of a naked baby girl. So he mashed her up, and made a boy. That didn&#39;t last either -- same reason. Finally he decided babies don&#39;t need gender, so that&#39;s Baby now. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gladstone:** I had no idea. That does explain a lot; thank you.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-237-2-9:** And then there&#39;s Faceless [SCP-237-2-4] and Gothic [SCP-237-2-10] and Gymnast [SCP-237-2-11] -- if he would have just taken the extra time to finish making with [!-- THIS IS A DELIBERATE INFELICITY OF LANGUAGE. DO NOT CORRECT IT.--] their details //before// giving them life... well, I can&#39;t blame him.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gladstone:** Why not?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-237-2-9:** ... no, you don&#39;t understand. Earlier, I said I can&#39;t believe he&#39;d just abandon us? I mean that literally. I //can&#39;t//. Just like I //can&#39;t// blame him. None of us can.
