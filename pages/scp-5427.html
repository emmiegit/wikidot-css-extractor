[[include component:image-block | name=cliffs2.jpg| caption=Effected Cliff Face After On-Set of Phenomenon]]

**Item #:** SCP-5427

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Carried out under the guise of enviromental conservation, the cliffs affected by SCP-5427 are to be regularly sprayed with erosion agents via boat and should any change in the effect of SCP-5427 on the cliffs be recorded, these erosion efforts are to be halted to enable observation. Publicly, storms caused by SCP-5427 are to be attributed to unique seabed formations in the Strait of Dover.

**Description:** SCP-5427 is a phenomenon - which started in 1950 - regarding periodic oddities in localized weather and its effects on a 13km stretch of chalk cliffs off of the coast of Kent, England. During the phenomenon a thick fog with no apparent cause will form around the edge of the coastline in the region; at the same time the coastal tide will intensify greatly, producing waves reaching heights of up to 300 meters despite no geological support for such tides. The resulting &#39;storm&#39; may last anywhere between a few hours and 3 weeks and will deposit vast amounts of pure chalk sediment onto the coastline which will in turn quickly solidify and merge with the existing cliff-face. Due to this the coastline in the region expands at an extremely-high rate of 20-40 meters per month; if the phenomenon is allowed to occur uninterruptedly, only the forward facing/original cliffs will be affected. This produces a narrow land bridge growing directly toward Calais, France.

[[size 150%]]Incident Report 5427-1: [[/size]]

**Date:** Feb 27 1960
**Event:** Series of massive waves similar to that of the SCP-5427 phenomenon generated off of the coast of Calais, France. The waves directly impacted the cliffs and caused massive deterioration. Cover up operation is ongoing.
