**Special Containment Procedures**

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Access Archived Containment Procedures&#34; hide=&#34;- ACCESS GRANTED&#34;]]
SCP-6179-1 and SCP-6179-2 are to be held in a large containment enclosure in the wildlife containment wing of Site-225. The enclosure should contain a grassy terrain with a variety of plant life allowed to grow for the purpose of grazing. SCP-6179-1 and SCP-6179-2 should be fed //Phleum pratense//[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Timothy[[/span]] hay on a daily basis. Any amenities requested by either SCP-6179-1 or SCP-6179-2 are to be provided on a case-by-case basis.
[[/collapsible]]

Both SCP-6179-1 and SCP-6179-2 are as of the current date, uncontained. MTF Upsilon-34 &#34;Bovine Ballistics&#34; has been created and tasked with capturing and recontaining both entities. SCP-6179-1 and SCP-6179-2 are currently estimated to be within northern Idaho, which is to be monitored and searched for both entities.

If recontained, SCP-6179-1 and SCP-6179-2 are to be held in separate Class II containment chambers, each within the heavy containment zone of Site-225.  Any amenities requested by either SCP-6179-1 or SCP-6179-2 are to be provided following approval from two Level 3 Personnel. SCP-6179-1 and SCP-6179-2 are not permitted to encounter one another. Any questions regarding the other entity or requests to visit the other entity are to be ignored or denied.

**Description**
SCP-6179 is the designation given to two linked entities, both being members of the species //Bos taurus//.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Cattle[[/span]] SCP-6179-1 is a female of the Highland breed and identifies as gender-fluid, while SCP-6179-2 is a female of the Belted Galloway breed. SCP-6179-2 possesses a nose ring, however how it obtained the ring is unknown. SCP-6179-1 possesses horns, while SCP-6179-2 is polled. Both SCP-6179-1 and SCP-6179-2 possess sapience and have been proven to be capable of communication through physical gestures, typing, and limited writing.

SCP-6179-1 and SCP-6179-2 are capable of limited telepathic communication with one another, possessing the ability to communicate a small amount of words to one another, and the ability to share emotions between one another. SCP-6179-1 and SCP-6179-2 both display large amounts of affection towards one another, both verbal and physical.

SCP-6179-1 and SCP-6179-2 possess several dangerous undocumented and undisclosed anomalous properties. Little is known about these properties, however, it is known that they are only active when both entities are within close vicinity to each other.

**Addendum 6179.1** Initial Containment and Interview Logs
The Foundation first became aware of SCP-6179-1 and SCP-6179-2&#39;s existence on 10/12/2011, after reports of two cattle purchasing several items from a thrift store in Show Low, Arizona came to the Foundations attention. Foundation Agents were sent to investigate, and encountered both SCP-6179-1 and SCP-6179-2 attempting to place an order through a Starbucks drive-through, via mooing into the intercom system. Foundation Agents were quickly able to subdue and contain both entities, and amnestics were administered to all civilians who had witnessed the events.

Following the containment of both SCP-6179-1 and SCP-6179-2, separate interviews were conducted with both entities. Both these interviews have been logged below.

= **INTERVIEW LOG**
**Date:** 10/13/2011
**Interviewer:** Dr. Rurran
**Interviewee:** SCP-6179-1
------
**[BEGIN LOG]**

//(The camera turns on. The view is of a temporary containment chamber, with an interview table set in the middle of it. SCP-6179-1 is within the chamber and is pacing. Dr. Rurran soon enters the room, holding a fold-up chair in one hand, and an M-class communication module[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]A module which integrates a modified text-to-speech program, allowing for large mammals to easily communicate.[[/span]] in the other. Two armed security personnel follow him into the room and stand by the door. SCP-6179-1 quickly turns to Dr. Rurran, and loudly moos at him.)//

**Dr. Rurran:** Now now, there&#39;s no need for that. I just want to talk to you.

//(SCP-6179-1 notices the two security personnel, and becomes visibly more distressed.)//

**Dr. Rurran:** Hey, don&#39;t worry about them. They&#39;re only going to hurt you if you try and impale me.

//(Dr. Rurran sets up the folding table on the side of the table opposite to SCP-6179-1 and sits down. He then places the module down on the table, and pushes it towards SCP-6179-1.)//

**Dr. Rurran:** It lets you speak to us. Do you know how to type?

//(SCP-6179-1 hesitantly moves towards the table, and examines the module.)//

**Dr. Rurran:** Just type whatever you want to say, using your... hooves? Maybe? Or your-

//(SCP-6179-1 begins pressing the module with its snout.)//

**Dr. Rurran:** That works too.

**SCP-6179-1:**  {{LET ME OUT.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** See, now we&#39;re getting somewhere! Although I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t let you leave. But don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll be safe here. We won&#39;t hurt you.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{WHERE IS SHE.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** She? Do you mean the cow you were with?

**SCP-6179-1:** {{YES. AZUL. WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Don&#39;t panic, your friend is safe. She&#39;s in a holding cell just like the one you&#39;re in.

//(SCP-6179-1 exhales through its nostrils)//

**Dr. Rurran:** Did you say Azul? Is that her name?

**SCP-6179-1:** {{WHY SHOULD I TELL YOU?}}

**Dr. Rurran:** I mean, you kinda already did.

//(SCP-6179-1 paws at the ground, and heavily exhales.)//

**Dr. Rurran:** Lets //not// do that. I get that you&#39;re scared and confused, but we are not going to hurt you. I just want to ask you a couple of questions, and then-

//(SCP-6179-1 bellows, and throws the table up into the air with its horns. Dr. Rurran stands up and catches the module. The security personnel aim their firearms at SCP-6179-1. SCP-6179-1 heavily exhales and paws at the ground.)//

 **Dr. Rurran:** Woah, hey! Calm down!

//(SCP-6179-1 bellows.)//

**Dr. Rurran:** Hey hey! Listen, this can only work if you&#39;re calm and cooperate. If you do, you can see your friend again.

//(SCP-6179-1 appears to calm down slightly. Dr. Rurran slowly retrieves the table and sets it back up in front of SCP-6179-1. He sits back down in his chair and places the module in front of SCP-6179-1. The security personnel lower their firearms.)//

**Dr. Rurran:** There. Let&#39;s try that again.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{IF I ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS, I WILL SEE AZUL?}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Yes, but only if you cooperate.

//(SCP-6179-1 is silent for a moment.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** {{OKAY. I WILL ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Great! First and foremost, my name is Dr. Rurran, but you can call me Nicholas if you&#39;d like. Or Nick, just not Nicky. What&#39;s your name?

**SCP-6179-1:** {{GEORGIA.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Excellent! Unfortunately, I won&#39;t be able to call you that, I&#39;ll have to refer to you as SCP-6179-1.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{WHAT THE HELL? THAT&#39;S BULLSHIT. I HAVE A NAME.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Yes, but for documentation purposes, we have to classify you as a number. The same goes for your friend.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{THAT IS FUCKING DEGRADING. WE HAVE NAMES. WHY THE FUCK DO YOU NEED TO DOCUMENT US?}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Because of your anomalous properties.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{I DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Your &#34;unusual&#34; abilities, such as your enhanced intelligence.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{SO JUST BECAUSE I&#39;M SMARTER THAN MOST COWS, YOU PUT ME IN PRISON?}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Exactly! Now you&#39;re getting it. Because of your abilities that would, by normal standers, be considered &#34;impossible&#34;, you are defined as a threat to normalcy. And we; the SCP Foundation, need to assess that threat.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{THAT IS BULLSHIT. IT&#39;S NOT MY FAULT I&#39;M &#34;NOT NORMAL&#34;. AND WE ARE NOT A FUCKING THREAT.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Yes I know, it&#39;s quite unfortunate. But, while you&#39;re here, we&#39;ll try our best to make your stay as enjoyable as it can be, since you are still a living creature.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{HOW LONG ARE YOU KEEPING ME HERE FOR?}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Let&#39;s just say you&#39;ll want to get comfy. Anyway, I still need to ask you questions. What were you and SCP-6179-2 doing in Show Low?

**SCP-6179-1:** {{HER NAME IS AZUL. USE HER FUCKING NAME.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Fine, you win. What were you and Azul doing in Show Low?

**SCP-6179-1:** {{THRIFTING. HAPPILY. I HAD PROMISED TO TAKE AZUL SHOPPING FOR A NEW DRESS. IT WAS A GOOD DAY UNTIL YOU GUYS SHOWED UP.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** If you don&#39;t mind me asking, //why?// You do realize you two are cows, right? You can&#39;t fit into a dress, at least not one made for humans.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{IT WAS THE THOUGHT AND THE EXPERIENCE THAT COUNTS. YOU THINK I LIKE NOT BEING ABLE TO FIT INTO HUMAN CLOTHES ANYMORE?}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Anymore? Were you a human before?

**SCP-6179-1:** {{YES. SO WAS AZUL.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** What happened?

**SCP-6179-1:** {{I&#39;M NOT TELLING YOU. YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO KNOW. YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO LOCK US UP.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Alright, fine. I won&#39;t bite into that bagel today. We&#39;ll come back to this later. I&#39;ll be going now.

//(Dr. Rurran stands up and reaches for the module. SCP-6179-1 begins typing.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** {{WHERE IS AZUL.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** You&#39;ll get to see her soon. Thank you for answering my questions, I&#39;ll see you again soon.

//(Dr. Rurran grabs the module, and turns to leave. SCP-6179-1 exhales through its nostrils.)//

**Dr. Rurran:** Hey, don&#39;t ruin this. You only get to see your friend if you cooperate, remember?

//(SCP-6179-1 glares at Dr. Rurran.)//

**Dr. Rurran:** I&#39;ll be going now. See you later, SCP-6179-1.

//(Dr. Rurran exits the containment chamber, followed by the two security personnel, who lock the door behind them. SCP-6179-1 stares at the door for approximately 5 minutes, before loudly bellowing several times. It then begins pacing around the containment chamber for the remainder of the recording.)//

**[BEGIN LOG]**

//(The camera turns on. The view is of a temporary containment chamber, with a table in the center. To the left of the table, is a fold-up chair. SCP-6179-2 is seen lying down on the floor, hyperventilating. Dr. Rurran soon enters the room with an M-class communication module, and SCP-6179-2 quickly stands up. Two security personnel follow Dr. Rurran, and stand by the door.)//

**Dr. Rurran:** Up an at &#39;em, sleepyhead! It&#39;s time for an Interview.

//(SCP-6179-2 is visibly distressed, and backs itself into the east side of the chamber.)//

**Dr. Rurran:** Oh I&#39;m not going to hurt you, I am simply here to talk. These guys behind me are simply a safety precaution.

//(Dr. Rurran sits at the table, and places the module down. Dr. Rurran pushes the module to the opposite side of the table.)//

**Dr. Rurran:** This device will allow you to speak with me. Just type whatever you want to say.

//(SCP-6179-2 moves towards the table, and examines the module. It sniffs it, licks it, and then looks at Dr. Rurran. SCP-6179-2 appears to be confused.)//

**Dr. Rurran:** I would recommend typing with your nose.

//(SCP-6179-2 begins typing with its snout.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** {{I AM NOT ANSWERING ANYTHING YOU ASK ME.}}

//(SCP-6179-2 pushes the module off the table with its snout, then turns away from Dr. Rurran.)//

**Dr. Rurran:** That was very rude.

//(Dr. Rurran picks up the module and places it back on the table.)//

**Dr. Rurran:** I&#39;ll tell you where Georgia is.

//(SCP-6179-2&#39;s ears perk up when the word &#34;Georgia&#34; is spoken.)//

**Dr. Rurran:** You&#39;d get to see her again.

//(SCP-6179-2 quickly turns around and begins typing.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** {{I&#39;D SEE THEM AGAIN?}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Yes, if you answer any questions I ask you.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{OKAY. CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION FIRST?}}

**Dr. Rurran;** Yes you may.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{IS GOERGIA OKAY?}}

**Dr. Rurran:**: Yes, she is in a containment cell just like this one. They are alive and well.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{PLEASE MAKE SURE SHE HAS ANYTHING SHE NEEDS.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Oh don&#39;t worry, she&#39;s fine. Obviously not in the best mood, but she&#39;s fine.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{WELL I CAN&#39;T BLAME HER. YOU TOOK US AWAY FOR NO REASON. I THINK WE HAVE A RIGHT TO BE A LITTLE UPSET.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Oh I didn&#39;t say you didn&#39;t! That doesn&#39;t change the fact that you&#39;re here. Anyway, I do have some questions for you.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{AS LONG AS YOU PROMISE THAT GEORGIA&#39;S OKAY.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** She is okay, I promise you.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{OKAY. THEN I WILL ANSWER ANY QUESTION YOU HAVE.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Excellent! First things first, I&#39;m Doctor Nicholas Rurran, you&#39;ll be seeing me a lot during your stay here. Just to clarify, your name is Azul, correct?

**SCP-6179-2:** {{YES. HOW DO YOU KNOW OUR NAMES?}}

**Dr. Rurran:** I have my ways. Anyway, we won&#39;t even need to know your names, you&#39;ll be referred to as SCP-6179-2 from now on.

//(SCP-6179-2 pauses.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** {{OH. OKAY.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Now, could you tell me what you were doing in Show Low with SCP-6179-1?

**SCP-6179-2:** {{IS THAT GEORGIA?}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Yes, that&#39;s the designation we&#39;ve given to her.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{WHY DO WE NEED DESIGNATIONS?}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Documentation purposes.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{OH. WELL, GEORGIA WAS TAKING ME OUT SHOPPING, UNTIL THOSE GUYS TOOK US HERE. ARE WE GOING TO BE HERE LONG?}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Unfortunately, you guys are indeed going to be here for a while.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{IS IT BECAUSE WE&#39;RE COW PEOPLE?}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Precisely! Now you&#39;re getting it. Which leads me to my next question, you haven&#39;t always been a cow, have you?

**SCP-6179-2:** {{NO. WE HAVEN&#39;T.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Care to explain how you&#39;ve come to your current predicament?

**SCP-6179-2:** {{NOT REALLY. BUT I&#39;M GUESSING I HAVE TO?}}

**Dr. Rurran:** If you want to see your friend, then yes.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{FINE. WELL, GEORGIA&#39;S FAVORITE ANIMAL IS A COW. HER FAVORITE BREED IS THE HIGHLAND BREED.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** That&#39;s ironic.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{SO, FOR HER TWENTY-FIFTH BIRTHDAY, I TOOK HER TO AN ANIMAL SANCTUARY IN NEVADA. CHOSE THIS ONE SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE IT WAS THE CLOSEST PLACE THAT HAD HIGHLAND COWS THAT YOU COULD INTERACT WITH.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Where did you live at the time?

**SCP-6179-2:** {{SHOW LOW.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Oh, so you still live in Show Low?

**SCP-6179-2:** {{WE TEND TO STAY AROUND THERE. AROUND OUR OLD HOME.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Oh? You two lived together?

**SCP-6179-2:** {{YES. WE WERE ROOMMATES. WE&#39;VE LIVED TOGETHER SINCE COLLEGE.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** And you still live in that house?

**SCP-6179-2:** {{NO. WE ARE COWS NOW. WE CAN&#39;T LIVE HUMAN LIVES ANYMORE. WE STILL TRY TO DO HUMAN THINGS, LIKE GO SHOPPING OR WALK THROUGH THE PARK, BUT IT&#39;S HARD WHEN YOU&#39;RE A COW. PEOPLE STARE AND GET CONFUSED. WE ALMOST GOT ATTACKED ONCE, SO WE USUALLY AVOIDED PEOPLE. WE STAYED IN PASTURES AND VALLEYS MOST OF THE TIME.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** That would make sense. Anyways, continue with your story.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{WELL, I DIDN&#39;T TELL GEORGIA WHERE WE WERE GOING, I JUST TOLD HER THAT IT WAS A SURPRISE. SHE DOESN&#39;T LIKE SURPRISES, SO SHE WAS A BIT ANXIOUS THE WAY THERE, BUT WHEN WE ARRIVED AND PULLED INTO THE LOT, AND SHE SAW A HIGHLAND PEERING AT US FROM BEHIND A FENCE, SHE SQUEALED.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Aww, that is very sweet.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{SHE WAS VERY HAPPY. I WAS VERY HAPPY. WE WENT INSIDE AND THEY LET US INTO THE PASTURE. THERE WERE SO MANY DIFFERENT COWS. HIGHLANDS, SIMMENTALS, BELTED GALLOWAYS.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Once again, ironic.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{SHE OBVIOUSLY WAS ALL OVER THE HIGHLANDS, SO WE PETTED THEM AND STAYED WITH THEM FOR A WHILE. AND FOR A WHILE I MEAN HOURS. WE MANAGED TO GET THEM TO &#34;PLAY&#34; WITH US, WE GOT THIS BIG ROPE TOY AND PLAYED TUG OF WAR WITH IT, THE COWS OBVIOUSLY WON EACH TIME, BUT IT WAS FUN NONETHELESS.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** It sounds like you two had fun.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{WE DID. AT ONE POINT LATER IN THE DAY WE TOOK OUT A BLANKET AND LIED DOWN TOGETHER WITH SOME COWS, AND JUST LOOKED AT THE SKY. JUST ME AND HER. TOGETHER. WE LIED THERE TOGETHER FOR HOURS UNTIL THE SUN STARTED TO GO DOWN. IT WAS THE BEST DAY EVER.}}

//(SCP-6179-2 pauses.)//

**Dr. Rurran:** Let me guess, until it wasn&#39;t?

**SCP-6179-2:** {{I DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT TIME IT WAS, BUT IT WAS JUST AS THE SUN WAS SETTING. THE SANCTUARY WAS CLOSING SOON, SO GEORGIA AND I WERE GETTING UP, AND SHE WAS SAYING GOODBYE TO ALL OF THE COWS. I HAD TURNED AWAY TO PUT OUR BLANKET IN OUR BAG WHEN I NOTICED A FIGURE IN THE DISTANCE.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** A person?

**SCP-6179-2:** {{THAT&#39;S WHAT I THOUGHT. I WAS ABOUT TO CALL TO THEM WHEN I NOTICED THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING OFF ABOUT THEIR FIGURE.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Something off?

**SCP-6179-2:** {{YOU KNOW HOW BATMAN IS ALWAYS DRAWN IN CARTOONS? LIKE HOW THERE&#39;S NO ACTUAL BODY DRAWN, IT&#39;S JUST HIS CAPE WRAPPED AROUND HIM? THAT&#39;S HOW THIS THING WAS DRESSED. THEY WERE WEARING THIS BLACK FEDORA AND HAD A BLACK VEIL GOING DOWN FROM IT. THEY HAD THEIR BACK TURNED TO ME, SO I COULDN&#39;T SEE THEIR FACE.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** What were they doing?

**SCP-6179-2:** {{THEY HAD SOMETHING IN THEIR HAND. A DISC OF SOME KIND. I WATCHED AS THEY PLACED IT ON A NEARBY COW, AND PRESSED IT. JUST AS THEY PRESSED IT, IT LIT UP, AND THE COW FUCKING WARPED IN ON ITSELF. AND THEN IT WAS GONE.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Sounds like he used a teleportation port.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{I DON&#39;T CARE WHAT IT WAS. I DIDN&#39;T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE. I YELLED GEORGIA&#39;S NAME AND TOLD HER TO COME OVER TO ME, AND THAT&#39;S WHEN IT TURNED TO ME.}}

//(SCP-6179-2 pauses.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** {{IT DIDN&#39;T HAVE A FACE. INSTEAD, IT HAD A BUNCH OF TENTACLES COMING OUT OF THE FRONT OF ITS HEAD, AND IT SHRIEKED AT ME. I TOLD GEORGIA TO RUN, BUT THE THING MOVED SO FAST. IT DIDN&#39;T EVEN RUN, IT WAS LIKE A GLITCHING VIDEO GAME CHARACTER, JUST INSTANTLY MOVING TOWARDS US. ONCE IT CAUGHT UP TO ME, IT- I DON&#39;T EVEN KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE IT. IT FORMED A BALL OF LIGHT IN HIS HANDS AND THREW IT TOWARDS ME. I FELL TO THE GROUND.}}

//(SCP-6179-2 pauses.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** {{I TURNED TOWARDS IT AS I TRIED TO CRAWL AWAY, AND IT BEGAN FLOATING IN THE AIR. IT SPOKE TO ME IN A GARGLED, HIGH-PITCHED VOICE. I COULD BARELY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS SAYING, SOMETHING ABOUT BREAKING A SPELL. THEN, IT LIFTED ITS HANDS INTO THE AIR AND FORMED A RED BALL OF LIGHT. THAT&#39;S WHEN I LOST CONSCIOUSNESS.}}

//(SCP-6179-2 pauses.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** {{I WOKE UP LATER THE NEXT DAY TO THE SOUND OF GEORGIA&#39;S VOICE, BUT I COULDN&#39;T SEE GEORGIA. INSTEAD, THERE WAS A HIGHLAND COW YELLING MY NAME. I TRIED TO STAND UP, BUT COULDN&#39;T. I HAD FOUR LEGS INSTEAD OF TWO. I HAD HAIR ALL OVER MY BODY. AND I REALIZED THAT THE HIGHLAND YELLING MY NAME WAS GEORGIA. THAT THING HAD TURNED US INTO CATTLE.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Was the figure anywhere close when you woke up?

**SCP-6179-2:** {{I DIDN&#39;T WANT TO KNOW. I NEVER SAW IT AGAIN, SO I&#39;M ASSUMING NOT. ONCE GEORGIA AND I FIGURED OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON, WE JUST SAT TOGETHER FOR A WHILE. TRYING TO COMPREHEND AND ACCEPT WHAT WAS HAPPENING. AS YOU CAN PROBABLY GUESS, IT WAS REALLY FUCKING HARD TO BELIEVE. AND TO ADAPT TO. IT TOOK A WHILE, BUT WE LEARNED TO LIVE LIKE THIS. SHE HELPED ME THROUGH EVERYTHING A LOT. AND I LIKE TO THINK I AT LEAST HELPED HER THROUGH IT A LITTLE.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** I am so sorry, that is quite a story. I&#39;m assuming you two returned to Show Low after these events?

**SCP-6179-2:** {{IT TOOK A WHILE, BUT WE FOUND OUR WAY BACK.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** I see. is there anything else that I should know?

**SCP-6179-2:** {{NO, THAT&#39;S THE STORY. DO I HAVE TO ANSWER ANY MORE QUESTIONS?}}

**Dr. Rurran:** No, I think that will be all for now. I&#39;m sure your nose hurts.

//(SCP-6179-2 nods.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** {{WILL I GET TO SEE GEORGIA?}}

**Dr. Rurran:** You will soon. I promise. I think we&#39;re done here my friend, thank you for your cooperation.

//(Dr. Rurran gets up from his chair and retrieves the module. He looks at SCP-6179-2, then proceeds to exit the chamber. The two security personnel follow and lock the door behind them. SCP-6179-2 remains still for approximately two minutes before it lies down. Tears are visible dripping from SCP-6179-2&#39;s eyes, and it cries for the remainder of the recording.)//

Following these events, the current containment procedures for SCP-6179 were implemented, and both SCP-6179-1 and SCP-6179-2 were contained together. Both entities were reported to appear significantly happier and calmer once around each other.

**Addendum 6179.2** Therapy Sessions
After the initial containment of both SCP-6179-1 and SCP-6179-2, Dr. Rurran requested that several therapy sessions be conducted with both entities, as to keep tabs on their mental and physical status. This request was accepted, and Dr. Rurran was assigned as research head for SCP-6179. Site-225&#39;s onsite therapist, Dr. Anish, was assigned to conduct several individual sessions with both SCP-6179-1 and SCP-6179-2, which have been logged below.

//(The camera turns on, the view is of the inside of Dr. Anish&#39;s office. Dr. Anish is seen reading at her desk until a buzz is heard from her door. She gets up and walks over to the door, where she presses a voice module)//

**Dr. Anish:** Dr. Anish&#39;s office.

//(Dr. Rurran&#39;s voice comes through the module.)//

**Dr. Rurran:** Hey Gwen! It&#39;s Rurran, here with SCP-6179-1 for its session.

**Dr. Anish:** Come on in.

//(Dr. Anish presses a button on the door, and it opens. On the other side, Dr. Rurran is seen next to SCP-6179-1, both of who are being escorted by two security personnel. SCP-6179-1 appears distressed. Dr. Rurran and SCP-6179-1 enter the room, while the two security personnel remain outside.)//

**Dr. Anish:** Welcome Georgia. I&#39;m the therapist here at Site-225, and as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve been informed, we&#39;ll be having weekly sessions together from now on. Of course, if that&#39;s okay with you.

//(SCP-6179-1 moos.)//

**Dr. Rurran:** Oh, yeah. There&#39;s a keyboard on the table there, One.

//(Dr. Rurran motions to a table to the right of them, upon which lies an M-class communication module. SCP-6179-1 moves over to it, and begins typing with its snout.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** {{I&#39;D LIKE TO HAVE THERAPY SESSIONS. WILL IT JUST BE ME OR YOU, OR WILL AZUL BE HERE?}}

**Dr. Anish:** Unfortunately, it will just be me and you.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{WELL THANK YOU FOR AT LEAST LETTING ME COME HERE FOR A SESSION.}}

**Dr. Anish:** Of course. Dr. Rurran, if you wouldn&#39;t mind stepping out.

**Dr. Rurran:** Oh! Yes. I&#39;ll be on my way. Once you&#39;re finished, One, the guards outside will escort you back to your enclosure.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{THAT SOUNDS GOOD. THANK YOU.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** Excellent. I&#39;ll see you around.

//(Dr. Rurran exits the room. Dr. Anish grabs a pen and clipboard off her desk, pulls her chair to the opposite side of the table to SCP-6179-1, and sits down.)//

**Dr. Anish:** Please, sit if it&#39;s more comfortable for you.

//(SCP-6179-1 sits down on the floor.)//

**Dr. Anish:** Would you like a cushion or something to sit on?

**SCP-6179-1:** {{NO. I&#39;M GOOD. I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU THOUGH.}}

**Dr. Anish:** Of course.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{WILL ANYONE ELSE KNOW WHAT WE TALK ABOUT IN HERE?}}

**Dr. Anish:** Nope, just me and you. This is a safe space. The information you share with me will be strictly confidential, not even Rurran will know.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{OKAY, BUT WHY WOULD I WANT TO TALK TO SOMEONE WHO&#39;S WORKING WITH THE PEOPLE WHO&#39;VE IMPRISONED ME IN THE FIRST PLACE?}}

**Dr. Anish:** Because, contrary to what you think, we&#39;re not evil. Sometimes the things we do are morally questionable, but we&#39;re not truly evil. Everything we do has a purpose. And the purpose of these sessions is to make sure you&#39;re doing okay, and if you&#39;re not, to help you with what&#39;s wrong.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{I DON&#39;T BELIEVE THAT, SORRY.}}

**Dr. Anish:** Well, I guess you&#39;ll just have to see. Let&#39;s start off with something simple. How are you feeling?

**SCP-6179-1:** {{NOT VERY GOOD. I&#39;M STILL STUCK HERE AND AZUL ISN&#39;T HERE RIGHT NOW, SO I DON&#39;T THINK I COULD BE FEELING  GOOD IN ANY WAY.}}

**Dr. Anish:** Well, I don&#39;t think I can do anything about you being stuck here, but I think I can help you in a way.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{HOW?}}

**Dr. Anish:** Well, is there anything you&#39;d like to have in your enclosure? Anything that would help make your stay here more comfortable?

//(SCP-6179-1 appears to think for a moment.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** {{A BED, OR BIG MATTRESS SINCE WE&#39;RE COWS. A REALLY BIG ONE.}}

**Dr. Anish:** I&#39;m sure I can arrange that. Would Azul like one as well?

**SCP-6179-1:** {{COULD WE HAVE ONE TO SHARE?}}

**Dr. Anish:** Of course.

//(Dr. Anish writes on her clipboard for a few seconds.)//

**Dr. Anish:** May I ask you something?

**SCP-6179-1:** {{SURE.}}

**Dr. Anish:** Are you and Azul together?

**SCP-6179-1:** {{LIKE, DATING?}}

**Dr. Anish:** Or married. I was just wondering if there&#39;s any romance between you two.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{OH, NO. SHE&#39;S JUST MY BEST FRIEND. I LOVE HER A SHIT TON BUT I&#39;M NOT ROMANTICALLY ATTRACTED TO HER.}}

**Dr. Anish:** ...You&#39;re positive?

**SCP-6179-1:** {{YES. DEFINITELY. ONE HUNDRED PERCENT POSITIVE.}}

**Dr. Anish:** If you say so. You&#39;ve known Azul for a while, right?

**SCP-6179-1:** {{YES. SINCE HIGHSCHOOL.}}

**Dr. Anish:** Oh my, that is a while.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{WE&#39;VE BEEN BEST FRIENDS EVER SINCE THEN. WE&#39;VE DONE A LOT TOGETHER.}}

**Dr. Anish:** I heard that you guys lived together, how was that?

**SCP-6179-1:** {{IT WAS WONDERFUL. WE WERE PLANNING ON STARTING A FARMING BUSINESS, WE WERE SAVING UP TO BUILD A PASTURE AND TO BUY SOME COWS. I&#39;VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A FARMER, AND AZUL HAS SUPPORTED THE WHOLE WAY.}}

**Dr. Anish:** I imagine it&#39;s hard now, not being able to do that.

//(SCP-6179-1 pauses.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** {{YEAH. IT IS.}}

**Dr. Anish:** I&#39;m so sorry Georgia, I know that&#39;s not easy to go through.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{AZUL KEEPS SAYING THAT MAYBE WE&#39;LL BE SWITCHED BACK ONE DAY, BUT I DON&#39;T KNOW.}}

**Dr. Anish:** Well, if there is a way, I&#39;m sure we can figure it out.

//(SCP-6179-1&#39;s ears perk up.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** {{YOU THINK WE COULD BE CHANGED BACK?}}

**Dr. Anish:** There&#39;s the possibility. Don&#39;t get your hopes up, but if we find a way, I&#39;ll be sure to let you know.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{THANK YOU.}}

**Dr. Anish:** Of course, Georgia.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{AND THANK YOU FOR CALLING ME BY MY NAME, UNLIKE ALMOST EVERYONE ELSE HERE.}}

**Dr. Anish:** I&#39;m the therapist, of course, I&#39;m going to call you by your name, not a number.

//(A slight smile is apparent on SCP-6179-1&#39;s face.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** {{THANK YOU.}}

**Dr. Anish:** It&#39;s my pleasure. I believe our session is over, sorry the first one is so short. I believe I&#39;ll be seeing you again next week.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{THAT&#39;S OKAY, SOME THERAPY IS BETTER THAN NONE.}}

**Dr. Anish:** Exactly. Thank you for your time, Georgia. The guards outside will escort you to your enclosure.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{THANK YOU.}}

**Dr. Rurran:** //(Through the module)// Hey hey! Guess who I have?

**Dr. Anish:** Bring her in, Nick.

**Dr. Rurran:** You&#39;ll be alright, Dr. Anish is going to be your therapist during these weekly sessions. Once you two are done, these two lads will bring you back to your cell.

**Dr. Anish:** Hey there Azul. My name is Dr. Anish, I&#39;ll be your therapist. Please, sit.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{OKAY. GEORGIA AND I WERE WATCHING NETFLIX ON THE TV THEY GAVE US. WE WERE WATCHING THAT AMAZING WORLD OF GUMBALL CARTOON.}}

**SCP-6179-2:** {{IT&#39;S VERY FUNNY.}}

**Dr. Anish:** I do have a question for you though.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{ALRIGHT. I HAVE AN ANSWER.}}

**Dr. Anish:** How do you... &#34;feel&#34; about Georgia?

**SCP-6179-2:** {{WHAT DO YOU MEAN?}}

**Dr. Anish** I mean, she told me you two aren&#39;t together, but I can&#39;t help but realize that you two do act like a couple. I&#39;ve seen some footage from your enclosure, and you guys act like you&#39;re together.

//(SCP-6179-2 does not respond.)//

**Dr. Anish:** Azul?

**SCP-6179-2:** {{WE&#39;RE NOT DATING, BUT, I DON&#39;T KNOW IF I WISH WE WERE.}}

**Dr. Anish:** What do you mean?

**SCP-6179-2:** {{I MEAN, WE ARE JUST FRIENDS. BUT SOMETIMES I LOOK AT HER AND LOOK INTO HER EYES, AND THERE&#39;S A PART OF ME THAT WISHES WE WERE MORE THAN THAT.}}

**Dr. Anish:** You&#39;re saying you have feelings for Georgia?

//(SCP-6179-2 pauses.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** {{I THINK I MIGHT.}}

**Dr. Anish:** Do you think you&#39;d want to be with her?

**SCP-6179-2:** {{I THINK I MIGHT WANT THAT.}}

**Dr. Anish:** Well, ask her out!

**SCP-6179-2:** {{I CAN&#39;T DO THAT! SHE&#39;S MY BEST FRIEND, AND I CAN TELL SHE DOESN&#39;T FEEL THE SAME ABOUT ME.}}

**Dr. Anish:** You don&#39;t know that. With the way she acts around you, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?}}

**Dr. Anish:** Well, she very much acts like she likes you. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised at all.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{BUT, WE&#39;RE BEST FRIENDS. WOULD THAT WORK?}}

**Dr. Anish:** My wife was my best friend for three years before we began dating. We&#39;ve been together for fifteen years.

//(A pause)//

**SCP-6179-2:** {{EVEN IF SHE DID LIKE ME, I&#39;D BE TOO AFRAID TO ASK HER.}}

**Dr. Anish:** Well, maybe I can help you with that.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{YOU COULD?}}

**Dr. Anish:** Of course I could!

//(A pause)//

**SCP-6179-2:** {{THANK YOU.}}

**Dr. Anish:** Of course. I hate to cut this time short, but today&#39;s session is scheduled as a shorter one. Just a little meet and greet. But next time, we can talk about this more.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{ALRIGHT. SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.}}

//(Dr. Anish smiles.)//

**Dr. Anish:** It does indeed.

//(SCP-6179-2 appears to smile slightly.)//

**Dr. Anish:** The guards outside will escort you back to your enclosure. I&#39;m looking forward to seeing you again, Azul.

//(SCP-6179-2 stands up.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** {{ME TOO. THANK YOU.}}

//(SCP-6179-2 turns and exits the room. Dr. Anish smiles and begins writing on her clipboard.)//

**[BEGIN LOG]**

//(The view is of Dr. Anish&#39;s office. Dr. Anish and SCP-6179-1 are sitting across from each other, conversing.)//

**Dr. Anish:** Wait, so you had horses at your school?

**SCP-6179-1:** {{YEAH! HORSES, BIRDS, REPTILES, FISH, THE WHOLE BUNDLE.}}

**Dr. Anish:** Any cows?

**SCP-6179-1:** {{OH YEAH. FARM MANAGEMENT CLASS WAS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE. THE COWS THERE WERE THE CUTEST.}}

**Dr. Anish:** I can see you have a profound love for cows.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{SEEMS IRONIC, DOESN&#39;T IT?}}

//(Dr. Anish laughs. SCP-6179-1 vocalizes in a tone similar to a laugh.)//

**Dr. Anish:** That school sounds wonderful. I attended standard public school, which as you can probably assume, was not the best.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{HEY, I DIDN&#39;T SAY MY SCHOOL WAS FREE OF ISSUES.}}

**Dr. Anish:** What was the name of the school?

**SCP-6179-1:** {{███████ ██████ █████████████ HIGHSCHOOL.}}

**Dr. Anish:** Oh! That&#39;s in ██████, right?

**SCP-6179-1:** {{YES. IT HAD ITS PROS AND CONS. LOTS OF CONS. SCHOOL GUIDANCE WAS ABSOLUTE SHIT, AND SOME TEACHERS WERE ABYSMAL. MOST OF THE SCHOOL WAS GAY THOUGH, SO I FOUND SOME PEOPLE I COULD HANG OUT WITH AMONG THAT CROWD.}}

**Dr. Anish:** Like Azul?

**SCP-6179-1:** {{PRECISELY. I MET HER AND A LOT OF MY CLOSE FRIENDS IN HIGH SCHOOL. ALTHOUGH I CAN&#39;T TALK TO MOST OF THEM ANYMORE, FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.}}

**Dr. Anish:** Oh, I&#39;m sorry. That must be difficult for you.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{I THINK IT&#39;S MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM. FOR ALL THEY KNOW ME AND AZUL JUST DISAPPEARED.}}

**Dr. Anish:** You are the one in the body of a bovine, you know.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{WELL, YES, THIS IS TRUE, BUT IT&#39;S STILL PROBABLY SCARY FOR THEM.}}

**Dr. Anish:** It&#39;s hard on everyone. At least you and Azul still have each other!

**SCP-6179-1:** {{I&#39;M SO GLAD WE DO. SHE&#39;S MY BEST FRIEND, WE NEED EACH OTHER.}}

//(Dr. Anish puts her pen to her lip, she appears to be thinking.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** {{IS EVERYTHING OKAY, GWEN?}}

**Dr. Anish:** Oh yes, don&#39;t worry I was just thinking.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{ARE YOU SURE?}}

**Dr. Anish:** Yes! Yes don&#39;t worry, I was just thinking about something Azul said.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{I WOULD ASK WHAT SHE SAID, BUT THAT WOULD BE BREAKING YOUR THERAPY OATH.}}

**Dr. Anish:** Oh yeah, big time. Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s nothing bad, In my opinion, it is quite the opposite.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{WELL THAT&#39;S GOOD. AS LONG AS SHE&#39;S OKAY.}}

**Dr. Anish:** Oh she is, don&#39;t worry. If she wasn&#39;t I&#39;m sure she would&#39;ve told you by now.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{SHE USUALLY DOES. WHICH IS GOOD, SO I CAN HELP HER OUT.}}

**Dr. Anish:** You two obviously care for each other a lot.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{DUH. I&#39;D DO ANYTHING FOR HER.}}

//(Dr. Anish taps her clipboard with her pen three times. She pauses and looks over her notes.)//

**Dr. Anish:** Do you plan on living with Azul for the majority of your life?

**SCP-6179-1:** {{WELL, YEAH. I MEAN, I DID PLAN ON IT. BEFORE COW SHIT HIT THE FAN. WE HAD OUR WHOLE LIFE PLANNED TOGETHER.}}

**Dr. Anish:** ...As friends?

**SCP-6179-1:** {{OH YEAH. ME AND HER ALWAYS TALK ABOUT HOW WE&#39;RE PLATONIC LIFE PARTNERS, AND HOW WE&#39;LL LIVE TOGETHER FOREVER WITH EACH OTHER.}}

//(Dr. Anish smiles)//

**Dr. Anish:** That sounds like it would be a wonderful life.

**SCP-6179-1:** {{IT IS. JUST BEING WITH HER ALL THE TIME IS SO GREAT.}}

**Dr. Anish:** As you can probably tell, she feels the same way.

//(SCP-6179-1 smiles.)//

**[BEGIN LOG]**

//(The view is of Dr. Anish&#39;s office. SCP-6179-2 and Dr. Anish are partaking in a game of battleship.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** B7.

**Dr. Anish:** You sunk my battleship!

//(SCP-6179-2 jumps in the air in excitement. This causes a significant shock throughout the room, causing a vase to topple over and shatter near the door.)//

**Dr. Anish:** Oh!

//(Dr. Anish stands up and moves over to the remnants of the vase.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** {{SHIT! I&#39;M SORRY!}}

**Dr. Anish:** Oh it&#39;s okay! Don&#39;t worry about it.

//(Dr. Anish picks up a dustpan and begins sweeping up the remnants with a brush.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** {{WAS THAT VASE IMPORTANT?}}

**Dr. Anish:** If I&#39;m being honest Azul, I hated that vase.

//(SCP-6179-2 makes a vocalization similar to a chuckle.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** {{WELL I&#39;M GLAD I DIDN&#39;T BREAK ANYTHING IMPORTANT.}}

**Dr. Anish:** Oh nothing in here is too important, all my important possessions are at my house. Everything here is pretty much replaceable.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{STILL, I&#39;M SORRY!}}

**Dr. Anish:** Don&#39;t be Azul! It&#39;s okay!

//(Dr. Anish finishes sweeping up the remnants and stands up. She drops the remnants in a trash bin and puts the dustpan and brush down. She returns to the table, and looks at the gameboard.)//

**Dr. Anish:** So, how are things going with Georgia?

**SCP-6179-2:** {{PRETTY GOOD! WE WATCHED THE NEW HARRY POTTER MOVIE YESTERDAY, WHICH WAS REALLY NICE!}}

**Dr. Anish:** That does sound nice! However, I was more referring to how you feel about them.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{OH. WELL, I HAVEN&#39;T SAID ANYTHING.}}

**Dr. Anish:** Ah. A3.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{MISS.}}

((/A pause.)//

**Dr. Anish:** Well, what would you want to say to them?

**SCP-6179-2:** {{I&#39;D WANT TO TELL THEM I WANT TO BE WITH THEM}}

**Dr. Anish:** Well, do you want to figure out what you want to say so you //can// tell them?

**SCP-6179-2:** {{I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE THAT.}}

**Dr. Anish:** Well, for starters, how long have you felt this way?

**SCP-6179-2:** {{AT LEAST 3 YEARS. I DIDN&#39;T REALLY ACKNOWLEDGE IT FOR A WHILE, AND JUST HID IT.}}

**Dr. Anish:** You should tell them that! Tell them you&#39;ve liked them for a while.

**SCP-6179-2** {{WOULDN&#39;T THAT CREEP THEM OUT?}}

**Dr. Anish:** I don&#39;t think so, they might think it&#39;s sweet.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{YOU THINK SO?}}

**Dr. Anish:** I do. if someone told me they have admired me for a while, I&#39;d be a little flustered.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{OKAY. I CAN TELL THEM THAT THEN.}}

**Dr. Anish:** Excellent! We&#39;re off to a great start. What else do you think you&#39;d want to say to them?

**SCP-6179-2:** {{WELL, I WANT TO TELL THEM HOW AMAZING THEY ARE. AND WHY I LOVE THEM. BECAUSE OF THE THINGS THEY DO EVERY DAY, AND HOW KIND AND CONSIDERATE THEY ARE.}}

**Dr. Anish:** That is so sweet, Azul.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{I MEAN, EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM IS PERFECT. I CAN STILL REMEMBER WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE. I&#39;LL NEVER FORGET THEIR FACE. THEIR EYES HAD THESE STAR SHAPES IN THEM, AND THEIR HAIR WAS RED AND SOFT.}}

//(SCP-6179-2 pauses.)//

`**SCP-6179-2:** {{I&#39;M JUST PRETTY SURE I LOVE THEM.}}

**Dr. Anish:** Then if that&#39;s how you feel, tell them that.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{REALLY? YOU THINK I SHOULD?}}

**Dr. Anish:** I do, Azul. I think you should tell them you love them.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{OKAY. OKAY, THEN I WILL.}}

**Dr. Anish:** I&#39;m so excited! I know it&#39;ll go great.

**SCP-6179-2:** {{HEY, GWEN?}}

**Dr. Anish:** Yes Azul?

**SCP-6179-2:** {{THANK YOU.}}

//(The view is of the SCP-6179 containment enclosure. SCP-6179-1 is seen grazing in the enclosure&#39;s pasture, while SCP-6179-2 is seen within the enclosure&#39;s stall, lying down on a large mattress. SCP-6179-2 deeply inhales.)//

//(SCP-6179-2 stands up, and exits the stall. It moves towards the pasture, and approaches SCP-6179-1, who is chewing on a strand of grass.)//

//(SCP-6179-2 calls out to SCP-6179-1, and SCP-6179-1 looks up. SCP-6179-2 walks up to a small stand in the pasture, which has an M-class communication module built into it. SCP-6179-2 begins typing.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** {{HEY HEY! HOW&#39;RE YOU FEELING?}}

**SCP-6179-1:** {{WHAT&#39;S THAT?}}

**SCP-6179-2:** {{I, WELL I HAVE A SPEECH PREPARED FOR THIS. GEORGIA, FOR A WHILE THERE-}}

//(SCP-6179-2 pauses.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** {{WELL, I-}}

//(SCP-6179-2 pauses again.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** {{FUCK IT. GEORGIA, WE&#39;VE BEEN FRIENDS FOR A WHILE, AND YOU&#39;VE BEEN AN AMAZING FRIEND. YOU&#39;VE ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR ME, AND YOU&#39;VE BEEN SO CONSIDERATE AND HAVE CARED FOR ME WHEN I NEED IT, AND GOD I CAN NOT THANK YOU ENOUGH.}}

//(SCP-6179-2 looks to the ground. then makes eye contact with SCP-6179-1.)//

**SCP-6179-2** {{THAT I FELL FOR YOU. AND THAT I&#39;M IN LOVE WITH YOU.}}

**SCP-6179-1:** {{I&#39;M IN LOVE WITH YOU TOO.}}

**SCP-6179-2:** {{YOU ARE?}}

**SCP-6179-1:** {{I AM. I&#39;VE LOVED YOU FOR A LONG TIME. I FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT YOU. YOU ALWAYS HELP ME WITH WHATEVER I NEED, WHENEVER I NEED. YOU ARE SO LOVING TO THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU, AND YOU ARE SO SELFLESS. I JUST- FUCK. I LOVE YOU, AZUL.}}

//(SCP-6179-1 and SCP-6179-2 both smile.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** {{I LOVE YOU TOO, GEORGIA.}}

//(Both entities step closer to one another and lean towards one another. The two entities kiss.)//

//(As the two entities kiss, they both begin to glow a bright yellow hue. The brightness of this glow slowly increases, until it begins to increase at a rapid rate. The glow increases until the entities are no longer visible, due to the immense amount of light emanating from them. The light then quickly shifts to a red hue. A large explosion occurs, originating from the two entities. The camera abruptly cuts out.)//

//(An estimated 30 seconds later, the camera feed returns. Containment breach alarms are blaring. The SCP-6179 containment enclosure is severely damaged. Several large chunks are missing from the walls of the enclosure, and several fires are apparent throughout the enclosure. Part of the ceiling is caved in, and debris is apparent throughout the chamber. The area where SCP-6179-1 and SCP-6179-2 are standing appears unscathed. Both entities are not present. In place of both entities, are two large piles of red hair and black hair.)//

//(After approximately 1 minute of no activity, the red pile of hair begins rustling. From underneath it, an entity staggers to its feet. The entity appears to be a nude female humanoid. The entity bears a high resemblance to a human, however has several differences. The entity has long white horns on each side of its head, located above its ears, which appear similar to those of a bovine. The entity has short red hair, and it has a large amount of red hair growing over its legs, up to its waist. The entity has two hooves in place of feet, as well as a bovine-like tail. This entity has been identified as SCP-6179-1. SCP-6179-1 looks around, and appears distressed.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** Azul?

//(SCP-6179-1 gasps and put its hands to its mouth. They appear shocked.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** Can- I can...

//(The pile of black hair begins rustling. SCP-6179-1 spins around. Another nude female humanoid quickly arises from the pile. It bears resemblance to a human, however has several abnormalities. The entity has long brown hair, as well as a septum piercing and bovine-like ears. The entity has a large amount of hair growing on its legs up to its waist, as well as possessing a bovine-like tail. In place of feet, the entity has two hooves. This entity has been identified as SCP-6179-2. SCP-6179-2 turns towards SCP-6179-1. Its eyes widen.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** I- Georgia?

//(SCP-6179-2 is startled by its own voice.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** Who said that? Wait, I did. I&#39;m talking? Holy shit! I can speak again!

**SCP-6179-1:** I can too!

**SCP-6179-2:** Oh my god! Georgia, it&#39;s you! Your voice, your face...

//(SCP-6179-2 walks over to SCP-6179-1. SCP-6179-2 takes hold of both of SCP-6179-1&#39;s hands.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** And now with horns and hooves-

**SCP-6179-1:** Wait, what?

//(SCP-6179-1 looks up at its horns, then down at its body.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** Well shit! And I&#39;m naked.

//(SCP-6179-2 looks at itself.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** It&#39;s okay, I am too. I&#39;ve got the hair as well.

**SCP-6179-1:** Wait, what the fuck happened? Are we Satyrs now?

**SCP-6179-2:** I guess we are. Better than being cows. But I have no clue. We were talking, and-

//(SCP-6179-2 looks to SCP-6179-1&#39;s eyes.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** We kissed.

**SCP-6179-1:** It was the best kiss I&#39;ve ever had, Azul.

**SCP-6179-2:** Oh come on. That was a cow kiss. I&#39;m sure I could do better now.

//(SCP-6179-2 wraps its arms around SCP-6179-1 and pulls it close to itself. Both entities kiss for several seconds.Once they stop, they both smile at each other.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** I love you, Azul.

**SCP-6179-2:** God, I love you so much Georgia.

//(There is a pause.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** But what the fuck happened to this place?

//(Both entities look around at the severely damaged enclosure.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** Holy shit. Did we do that?

**SCP-6179-2:** I have no idea.

**SCP-6179-1:** Is this some like, Princess and the Frog shit?

**SCP-6179-2:** True loves kiss?

//(SCP-6179-1 smiles.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** I guess so.

//(SCP-6179-2 smiles.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** I&#39;ll go into depth about my undying love for you later, right now we have to get out of here.

**SCP-6179-1:** You mean escape?

**SCP-6179-2:** Yes. Escape.

//(A voice is heard over the Site&#39;s intercom system.)//

**Intercom:** CONTAINMENT BREACH CURRENTLY ONGOING IN WILDLIFE CONTAINMENT WING. ALL NON-SECURITY PERSONNEL SHOULD REPORT TO AN EVACUATION SHELTER IMMEDIATELY. MOBILE TASK FORCE ETA-7 HAS BEEN DISPATCHED TO SECURE ANY ESCAPED ANOMALIES. I REPEAT, CONTAI-

//(The Intercom cuts out. To note, the Intercom system at this time had gone offline.)/

**SCP-6179-1:** That is definitely us.

**SCP-6179-2:** Shit. Okay, We have to leave.

//(SCP-6179-2 grabs SCP-6179-1&#39;s hand and begins running towards a hole in the wall. They reach the hole and exit the containment enclosure. They enter a corridor on the other side and look around. The corridor is heavily damaged, and a small fire is apparent in the corridor.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** Okay, where do we go?

**SCP-6179-2:** No clue.

**SCP-6179-1:** I think this is the hall we take to Gwen&#39;s office.

**SCP-6179-2:** We take an elevator when we go to her office.

**SCP-6179-1:** You think maybe it leads to the surface?

**SCP-6179-2:** If our love explosion didn&#39;t destroy it, that is.

//(The two entities begin running down the corridor. Parts of the walls and ceiling are scattered across the floor, causing SCP-6179-2 to cut its ankle on debris.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** Ow! fuck!

//(SCP-6179-2 begins to stumble, but SCP-6179-1 catches it. The two entities stop running.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** Shit! What happened? Are you okay?

**SCP-6179-2:** //(sharply inhales)// My ankle, I cut it.

//(SCP-6179-1 kneels and examines SCP-6179-2&#39;s ankle. There is a large laceration on its ankle, which is bleeding. SCP-6179-1 stands back up and holds puts SCP-6179-2&#39;s arm around the back of its own neck, and wraps its own arm around its back.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** It&#39;s okay, you&#39;re going to be okay. We&#39;re going to find something to patch that up with. But we have to keep going.

**SCP-6179-2:** Okay. //(sharply inhales)// If I can&#39;t keep up, go without me.

**SCP-6179-1:** That is not happening.

//(The two entities smile. They continue running, however, SCP-6179-2 has developed a limp. The two entities come to a junction.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** We go left here.

//(The entities go down the left corridor. The corridor is still heavily damaged. Down the corridor, are the bodies of three security personnel.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Note: these personnel are confirmed to have been killed in the explosion caused by SCP-6179-1 and SCP-6179-2.[[/span]]//

**SCP-6179-2:** Oh my god.

**SCP-6179-1:** Are those... did we-

**SCP-6179-2:** Just- try not to think about it.

//(There is a pause.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** We could use the clothes.

**SCP-6179-2:** You know, I was thinking the same thing.

//(SCP-6179-1 assists SCP-6179-2 in undressing itself. It rips a piece of one of the personnel&#39;s shirts off and wraps it around SCP-6179-2&#39;s wound. It then assists SCP-6179-2 in dressing itself, after which it begins to dress itself. SCP-6179-1 has difficulty pulling the uniform shirt over its horns, but eventually succeeds.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** There we go.

//(SCP-6179-1 finishes clothing itself, then helps SCP-6179-2 to its feet, who has been sitting on the ground.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** Okay, let&#39;s get out of here.

**SCP-6179-2:** Wait.

**SCP-6179-1:** What?

//(SCP-6179-2 points to one of the security personnel&#39;s MP5 firearm&#39;s on the ground.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** Do you know how to work one of those?

**SCP-6179-2:** No. But we&#39;ll need it anyway.

//(SCP-6179-1 picks up the MP5.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** Let&#39;s go.

//(SCP-6179-2 looks at SCP-6179-1.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** Right.

//(Both the entities smile at each other. They quickly continue down the corridor, until they come to a junction. They turn left, at the end of each junction is an elevator.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** The left one leads to Gwen&#39;s, right?

**SCP-6179-2:** I think so. That&#39;s probably the safest option.

//(Both entities make their way to one of the elevators. Once they reach it, SCP-6179-1 presses the call button on the elevators control panel.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** We&#39;re gonna make it.

**SCP-6179-2:** Together, I know we will.

//(The control panel on the elevator at the end of the right corridor dings, and the doors open. Inside, are several members of MTF Eta-7 &#34;Birds of Prey&#34;, being E7-Cap, E7-5, and E7-3. They quickly spot the entities.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** Shit!

**E7-Cap:** //(into his comm)// Command, we have sight of two unidentified entities in the wildlife containment zone. Be advised.

//(SCP-6179-1 begins rapidly pressing the elevators call button.)//

**Command:** //(Through E7-Cap&#39;s comm)// Acknowledged. You are to capture both of them for evaluation. Lethal force is authorized if they display hostility.

**E7-Cap:** Roger that.

//(The three team members aim their weapons at both entities. They begin to move towards the entities.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** Azul, get behind me.

//(SCP-6179-2 gets behind SCP-6179X-1. SCP-6179-1 aims its firearm at the team. The team halts.)//

**E7-Cap:** Unidentified Anomaly, put your weapon down, now. We //will// open fire.

**SCP-6179-1:** No, I&#39;ll shoot you. Not the other way around, assface.

**E7-Cap:** You have ten seconds, or we //will//.

//(Neither SCP-6179-1 nor any members of Eta-7 back down.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** Georgia?

//(SCP-6179-1 does not respond. After approximately 9 seconds, the elevator dings, and its doors open.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** Go!

**E7-Cap:** Open fire!

//(All three team members open fire towards the entities, as they quickly run into the elevator. The entities manage to evade the ongoing fire. SCP-6179-2 quickly presses the &#34;close doors&#34; button, and SCP-6179-1 opens fire on Eta-7. SCP-6179-1 manages to shoot E7-5 in the leg, however, is then shot in the left shoulder by E7-Cap. SCP-6179-1 exclaims and falls to the ground, dropping its MP5 as the elevator doors close.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** GEORGIA!

//(SCP-6179-2 quickly examines the elevator control panel, and presses the &#34;GL&#34;.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Ground Level.[[/span]] button. SCP-6179-2 then quickly moves over to SCP-6179-1 and gets on its knees. It looks over SCP-6179-1, which is grasping its shoulder in pain.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** Shit, Georgia, fuck...

//(Blood begins to pool beneath SCP-6179-1&#39;s shoulder.)/

**SCP-6179-2:** Fuck, fuck.

//(SCP-6179-2 takes its left arm out of its sleeve, and holds the sleeve against one of SCP-6179-1&#39;s horns. SCP-6179-1 exclaims in pain.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** Don&#39;t worry, don&#39;t worry it&#39;s going to be okay, just let me-

//(SCP-6179-2 tears the sleeve of the uniform using SCP-6179-1&#39;s horn, and puts its arms back through the now open hole in the uniform. It then moves the sleeve over to SCP-6179-1&#39;s wound.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** Okay, okay, do you think you can move your hand for me?

**SCP-6179-1:** //(heavily breathing)/ I can maybe...

//(SCP-6179-1 moves its hand off of its wound. The wound is bleeding profusely. SCP-6179-2 takes a deep breath.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** Okay, let me put this...

//(SCP-6179-2 wraps the sleeve around the wound, and ties it. SCP-6179-1 is breathing heavily.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** Okay, okay. I think that should stop the bleeding.

//(SCP-6179-2 holds SCP-6179-2&#39;s hand. SCP-6179-1 squeezes it tightly, while it continues to breathe heavily.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** It&#39;s going to be okay, you&#39;re going to be okay, I promise.

**SCP-6179-1:** Thank you...

**SCP-6179-2:** Don&#39;t thank me. Thank //you// for risking your life for me, you didn&#39;t have to do that.

**SCP-6179-1:** Of course I did, I love you Azul...

**SCP-6179-2:** I love you too, Georgia...

//(SCP-6179-2 leans over and kisses SCP-6179-1. The elevator dings.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** Okay. We&#39;re on the ground floor, we need to go.\

//(The elevator doors open to Site-225&#39;s ground level. SCP-6179-2 helps SCP-6179-1 to its feet, and both entities stand up. SCP-6179-1 inhales sharply, and groans in pain.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** It&#39;s going to be okay, we&#39;re going to get out of here.

//(SCP-6179-2 wraps SCP-6179-1&#39;s arm around the back of its own neck, and then wraps its arm around the back of SCP-6179-1. The two exit the elevator, and due to SCP-6179-2&#39;s limp, begin slowly making their way through the Ground Level Zone. The Ground Level Zone is severely damaged from the explosion, with several bodies of deceased and unconscious personnel present.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** Don&#39;t pay attention to that, We&#39;re going to make it.

**SCP-6179-1:** We just might.

//(The entities continue slowly through the Ground Level Zone, and eventually make it to the Site&#39;s main entrance.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** There&#39;s the entrance!

//(Through the entrance doors, several MTF SUVs are seen quickly pulling into the Site&#39;s parking lot. Several armed members of MTF Epsilon-12 &#34;Crusaders&#34; and MTF Psi-19 &#34;Street Rats&#34; quickly exit the vehicles, and begin advances towards the site.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** Shit, shit!

**SCP-6179-1:** Fuck.

**SCP-6179-2:** Quick, hide!

//(SCP-6179-2 and SCP-6179-1 frantically look for a place to hide, as the MTF units rapidly approach the Site. The entities eventually find a storage closet, and enter it, closing the door behind them. Inside the dark storage closet, the floor is cluttered with cleaning supplies, clothes, and debris.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** Shit, fuck. We&#39;re trapped.

**SCP-6179-1:** Hide under the rubble.

**SCP-6179-2:** What?

**SCP-6179-1:** //(grunts in pain)// Just, get under all of this stuff!

**SCP-6179-2:** Okay, okay, good idea.

//(SCP-6179-2 and SCP-6179-1 help each other to the ground, however, both are visibly in pain. They begin covering themselves in the objects on the ground. They are mostly successful due to a large amount of objects and large pieces of debris being in the closet, however, SCP-6179-1&#39;s horns are still visible, due to it leaning its head forward.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** Georgia, your horns-

**SCP-6179-1:** I know, but my shoulder, if I lean back it&#39;s going to hurt so much.

//(Several sets of footsteps are heard outside the door.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** //(quietly))// I know it&#39;s going to, but if you don&#39;t lean back we will never get out of here. We won&#39;t get to go live a life together and fall in love with each other every single day. I promise it&#39;s going to be okay, but you have to lean back.

**SCP-6179-1:** Okay, I&#39;ll-

//(SCP-6179-1 leans back and rests their body completely on the floor, their horns are now barely visible under the rubble. SCP-6179-1 sharply inhales, and groans.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** Fuck, Azul-

**SCP-6179-2:** It&#39;s going to be okay, it&#39;s-

//(The door swings open. E12-3 of Epsilon-12 enters the room, and looks over the closet, using the tactical light on her firearm to see. She quickly scans the room, however, does not spot either entity.)//

**E12-3:** Clear!

//(E12-3 quickly exits the room, leaving the door open. For approximately the next 10 minutes, members of both present MTFs can be heard clearing rooms and conversing with each other. SCP-6179-1 can be heard quietly groaning periodically throughout the 10 minutes. Both MTF Units eventually enter the elevators and descend to the lower levels of the site. SCP-6179-1 and SCP-6179-2 are silent for approximately another 5 minutes.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** //(quietly)// I think they&#39;re gone.

//(SCP-6179-2 slowly pushes debris and other objects off of it, as it sits up.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** Georgia?

**SCP-6179-1:** Azul, my shoulder really hurts...

//(SCP-6179-2 moves over to SCP-6179-1, and pushes objects and debris off of it.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** I promise, we&#39;re gonna get you help as soon as we get out of here.

//(SCP-6179-2 helps SCP-6179-1 stand up.)//

**SCP-6179-2:** It should be clear skies from here.

//(The two entities assist each other in walking, and exit the closet. They cautiously make their way back towards the entrance, and peer through the gate.)//

**SCP-6179-1:** I don&#39;t see anyone.

**SCP-6179-2:** Me neither.

**SCP-6179-1:** Do you think it&#39;s safe?

**SCP-6179-2:** Only one way to find out.

//(SCP-6179-2 pushes the gate open. Both entities walk through the gate, and out of frame.)//

**[END LOG]**
[[/div]]
[[/collapsible]]

Following the events of the previous log, SCP-6179-1 and SCP-6179-2 stole a truck from the Site&#39;s parking lot, and managed to escape the Site, despite ongoing fire from Foundation forces. The vehicle&#39;s tracking device allowed Foundation assets to track the entities to Twin Falls, Idaho, upon which the truck apparently ran out of gas. Upon reaching the location of the vehicle, it had been abandoned.

Following Incident 6179-1, MTF Unit Upsilon-34 &#34;Bovine Ballistics&#34; was formed with the purpose of locating and recontaining both SCP-6179-1 and SCP-6179-2. Efforts to locate the entities have been as of yet, unsuccessful.

**Addendum 6179.4:** 1/8/2022
On the eighth of January, 2022, a note was found upon Dr. Anish&#39;s office desk. How the note appeared in her office is currently unknown, however, it is believed to have been written by SCP-6179-2. The content of the note has been logged below.

Dear Gwen
@@@@
@@@@
First off, I have to thank you.
If it weren&#39;t for you, I don&#39;t think I ever would have told Georgia how I feel. We would not be where we are today. And for that, I can not thank you enough, Gwen.
@@@@
I can&#39;t tell you too much, cause I know the Foundation would be on our asses in a second if we did, but me and Georgia escaped, as I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware. We stole a truck, almost got shot, and drove until we ran out of gas. Then, we just kept going. It was, quite possibly the worst two days of our lives, considering Georgia still hadn&#39;t been treated for his gunshot wound, and my ankle kept bleeding periodically. We went like that for two days. I don&#39;t know how we didn&#39;t die.
@@@@
But we made it. Again, I can&#39;t say where, not only for our sake, but for the people who took us in and helped us. Who taught us. They weren&#39;t normal, no, but neither are we. I can barely remember what being &#34;normal&#34; was like anymore.
They healed me and Georgia, and set us up with somewhere to live. Long story short, me and Georgia began dating. (I know, you told me so.)
And sometime later, we became engaged.
The wonderful day eventually came when I got to walk down the aisle towards the one I love. The one I care for more than I ever thought I could. The one who would be my betrothed until the end of eternity.
@@@@
And I have you to thank.
@@@@
Me and Georgia have three kids now. Yes, they are in fact &#34;anomalous&#34; as well. And for that sake, we will make sure you can //never// ever find us.
@@@@
Thank you for everything Gwen, and if this was a perfect world, you would have been sitting in the front row on our wedding day.
@@@@
With love,
Azul
@@@@

P.S., since you weren&#39;t there, here&#39;s a photo from that magical day.
