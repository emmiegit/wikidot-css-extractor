||~ INITIAL INCIDENT REPORT||
**DATE OF OCCURRENCE:** January 2nd, 1985

**CODENAME:** COLDPOST

**NATURE:** Ectoentropical, Thermic@@  @@--@@  @@[[[Log Of Extranormal Events|Extranormal Event]]]

**LOCATION:** Site-198, &#34;Heavy&#34; Containment Sector, M Wing

**EVENT DESCRIPTION:** The entirety of Site-198&#39;s M Wing, under construction at the time, presented a sudden temperature drop, reaching around -360°F in approximately 2 minutes and causing the generation of a dense fog in the area.

5 minutes after the incident, the temperature normalized and the fog dissipated, revealing the following objects in the middle of M Wing:

* Eleven unmarked cardboard boxes, each with 120 books about occultism and ritual performance
* Seven packages of 24 small unlabeled bottles containing 300ml of an anomalous amnestic compound, believed to be similar in composition to [http://lafundacionscp.wikidot.com/scp-es-049 A09/93]
* A single electric guitar, made of [[[SCP-6071|Sli-37]]], with its headstock torn off; further anomalous properties, if any, are currently unknown or believed to only be triggered when using the item
* Twenty standard boxes of 50 BiC Cristal pens[[footnote]] 25 black, 20 blue, and 5 red [[/footnote]], all of which show the same properties as [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-es-013 SCP-ES-013]

It should be noted that none of the items were affected by the cold temperature of the zone.

**FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS TAKEN:** Containment Team TANGO J-21 was quickly deployed to retrieve and secure the generated items, doing this task successfully without any further incident. Retrieved objects provisionally classified as UnRegistered Anomaly (URA) #273 to #277 and contained on Site-198&#39;s &#34;Light&#34; Containment Sector. The fourth retrieved set of items was sent to [[[Secure Facilities Locations|Site-34]]].

All construction efforts in the area have been put on standby until the Site&#39;s M Wing is cleared and determined to be a safe zone to operate in.

A total of 4 corpses of personnel members that died during the incident have been recovered for autopsy and are currently stored in Site-198&#39;s morgue; the remaining corpses have been disposed of accordingly. No acroamatic abatement procedures for their remains were deemed necessary.

Analyzes and research efforts in the area have been inconclusive so far.

||~ CURRENT SCP ITEM REPORT -- RAISA ACCESS ONLY||
**ITEM #:** [CURRENTLY UNDECIDED -- CODENAMED {{COLDPOST}}]

**CLASS:** [CURRENTLY UNDECIDED]

**CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:** The entirety of Site-198&#39;s M Wing has been declared a hazardous area and its access has been prohibited.

If COLDPOST occurs, Applied Task Force Delta-14-bis (&#34;Winter Neverland&#34;)[[footnote]]A cell of Mobile Task Force Delta-14 (&#34;Winter Wonderland&#34;)[[/footnote]] will be deployed in the zone to retrieve or neutralize the generated items as deemed necessary.

**DESCRIPTION:** COLDPOST designates a bi-monthly event in Site-198&#39;s M Wing where the temperature of this entire section will suddenly drop to around -364°F for a variable amount of time, usually between 2 and 5 minutes, before returning to normal.

When COLDPOST occurs, a number of anomalous objects and occasionally entities will ectoentropically manifest within M Wing, although their exact manifestation process hasn&#39;t been observed due to the fog that is generated by the extremely low temperatures. Despite this, the items do not seem to be affected in any way by the coldness of the environment.

A full list of retrieved items and their status can be read on [# Supplemental Document LUNA-COLDPOST-01D].

Further information to this file will be added as it&#39;s gathered.

||~ ADDENDUM -- RAISA ACCESS ONLY||
On September 3rd, 1985, another COLDPOST event occurred; however, instead of a set of anomalous artifacts, only a standard-sized homemade two-tiered banana cake, a vacuum-sealed bundle containing 2.25 million US dollars in cash, and a note manifested in the area, none of them featuring anomalous properties.

The contents of the retrieved note are shown below.

To whom it may concern:

I owe your organization both an apology and an explanation for the recent incidents regarding the paranormal items that have been appearing within your facility.

This season hasn&#39;t been a particularly good one for MC&amp;D, especially considering that the recent passing of my mother, Mrs. Dark, has put us in a somewhat problematic situation with our unsold stock.

In light of this, my boss, Mr. Carter, asked me to get rid of the excess product in quite an unorthodox way: send them over to &#34;the Foundation&#34;. I was pretty much a newcomer at the time and didn&#39;t know who you people were, so he briefed me about you.

He told me he&#39;d arrange everything to anonymously transport the surplus to you: the mechanism to be used, the assets, everything. I&#39;d just need to make sure it happened. Needless to say, I opposed and pitched several alternatives, but all of them were discarded because, crazy as it sounds, MC&amp;D makes up the entire global anomaly market, and all my proposals would eventually make the products get back to us in no time.

I followed Mr. Carter&#39;s instructions for a while; however, just about two weeks ago, I finally managed to arrange a better deal that will benefit both our customers and our organization -- as well as yours, obviously, without the need of involving your facilities or personnel in any way, so consider this unfortunate series of incidents done with. No more unwanted anomalous unsold merch in your headquarters ever again!

As a way of apologizing and making amends for all the trouble my actions most surely caused, and as a... &#34;symbol of peace&#34;, if you want, please accept this cake I&#39;ve baked myself -- it&#39;s an old family recipe! I hope this can mark a fresh new start for both of our corporations.

As a more direct form of indemnification, I&#39;ve also sent a monetary redress to cover reparation expenses, as well as to be delivered to the families of your personnel that died as a result of the transport, although I understand that no amount of money will ever fully compensate for the loss of a deceased colleague or relative.

For any further inquiries please reach me //privately//. I&#39;ll make sure to respond ASAP.
[[&gt;]]
