//On the icy plains of a sea frozen solid long ago below a sunless sky a young augmented thaumaturge runs from the band of underground cities around the equator. Picked up by a group of salvagers who scour the empty expanse for scrap metal, she aims to disappear completely into the smog. But the wastes are far from empty, and the scabs around her poorly-grafted augment hands call to a past she is desperate to forget.//

//But with the boundaries between what is right and what is wrong dissolving into mist the deeper she travels, the question is not a matter of survival. It is a matter of what of her survives. And who can she trust when her magic marks her as a tool?//

//Above it all the Ring turns, altering the planet’s spin to guide it to a new sun as it careers into the nullscape of space. It has turned for generations uncountable with the liar’s promise of progress, perpetually under construction, perpetually incomplete, and will keep turning until the last star snuffs out.//

**This is //Ocular Haze//. A story about body augmentation, guilt, and the right thing to do.**

&gt; It&#39;s a crime that these aren&#39;t more widely read. The prose is delicious, the worldbuilding is solid and intriguing, and the character dynamics are fluid and fascinating. Beautiful stuff.
&gt;

&gt; Just tore through reading this series, not sure how I didn&#39;t find it sooner, but also glad I get to see it in the state it is now. I think this cleverly blends together bodily augmentation, what makes us human, magic, and a dark gritty setting in a way that I just can&#39;t get enough of it. I don&#39;t typically read a lot in this sort of genre either, but the character work and worldbuilding is so well done I was fully engrossed. Also - Elbows is, without a doubt, my favorite. Looking foward to more.

&gt; A great opener. The worldbuilding hits you hard and fast but there&#39;s also some really good characterisation done in a short span.
&gt; [[*user Sobek109]]

&gt; gross! love it. very grimy, the best kind of scifi. smooth shiny chrome is passe, give me that rusted-over industrial prosthesis leaking oil and requiring regular maintenance. sci-fantasy is a saturated genre to say the least but this introduces a fun new vibe to it that i really like, and does quite a lot to characterize both Scabs and the world we&#39;re exploring given the relatively short length of the piece. very good.

[[collapsible show=&#34;A Message From the Author&#34; hide=&#34;A Message From the Author&#34;]]

This was, writing practice.

I had, a five-part plan.

Five parts.

A simple story about a girl escaping from people who wanted her dead only to stumble into the instability of a separate political turmoil with the Olristaan. Some cool cyborgs. A few railguns. A goofy gritty setting. A silly author avatar with loads of elbows.

...

This was //supposed// to be about learning to write quickly to a definitive plan. Then I&#39;d go back to my main writing project, a novel I had not insignificant progress towards finishing when I started this side project.

...

I need to rewrite that work on my novel now, because I have learned far, far too much from writing this.

Fuck you, Scabs. Fuck you, Eithenin. Fuck you, Elbows. You weren&#39;t supposed to grow on me. I wasn&#39;t supposed to care.

Not the Olristaan, though. I can fix her guys, I promise I feel completely normal toward her. She&#39;s not that bad guys, GLaDOS: Long Edition is actually just morally confused and not an uncaring fanatical bastard with a morality so twisted that it&#39;s under torsion at all. She has dichromaticism, that&#39;s cute and kawaii and shit guys. --I want her to step on me--

(For legal reasons this is ironic)

And of course, a massive thank you to everyone who&#39;s read, commented, upvoted, and most importantly //critiqued// these things along the way. For so long this series languished with a really weak part one- the current parts one and two- before I completely rewrote them in a bid to improve my weaker writing there, and that revitalisation would not have been possible without crit. Thank you.
