[[# what]]
+++ What Is Third Law?
[[/=]]

Third Law is a canon -- a single, self-contained and self-consistent setting within the larger Foundationverse. In terms of genre, it typically sits at the intersection of urban fantasy, science fiction, and science fantasy. Third Law focuses on the human impacts of the paranormal, exploring the culture, economy, laws, art, and science of the world behind the Veil.

Third Law does not have a main overarching narrative, instead hosting dozens of separate stories which occasionally intersect and overlap within a single shared continuity. There is a great deal of variety in style and genre between these stories -- Third Law includes cyberpunk, police procedurals, conspiracy thrillers, Minnesota, time travel, murder mysteries, time travel murder mysteries, war stories, college slice-of-life, and much more. Stories within Third Law tend to be driven by complex characters in well-developed settings, with rigorous attention to logic and detail.
