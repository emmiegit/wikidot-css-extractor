[[div class=&#34;poem&#34;]]
Once upon a time we ruled over all.
Our Queen and her Sister stood so tall.
But then Our Queen&#39;s Sister would have the gall,
To embrace the lesser beneath us all.
She loved both Mortals and all of Nature,
So Our Queen twisted their forms to mock her.
Turning Nature into weapons for us.
Making it so wondrously dangerous.
Even now, we can wield her power still.
We can bend all of Nature to our will.
Even these tiny organic machines,
Spread Our Queen&#39;s curse by their infectious means.
Turning men to beasts is only the start.
We won&#39;t stop &#39;til we&#39;ve reclaimed Our Queen&#39;s Heart.
Even now Mortals still use its power,
To run a Factory so vile and dour.
Someday we&#39;ll bring it all crashing down.
Then Our Queen will rise and reclaim her crown.
Knowing who we are does nothing for you.
Get in our way again, and //you&#39;ll fall too.//

**Item #:** SCP-6090

**Object Class:** --Keter-- Flor Galana[[footnote]]Item aids the Foundation in partially containing itself and/or other anomalies, but cannot be fully contained for logistical and/or ethical reasons.[[/footnote]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** All infected non-human organisms will henceforth be referred to as SCP-6090-A instances. SCP-6090-A instances are to be kept in standard animal containment units.  All contact between SCP-6090-A instances and non-infected animals is strictly prohibited without approval from a researcher with Level 3 or higher clearance. All contact is to be closely monitored at all times; all safeguards are to be taken to prevent bleeding injuries or any other potential methods of bodily fluid contamination. If contamination does occur, the potentially infected individual is to be immediately given medical aid, administered analgesics[[footnote]]Painkillers.[[/footnote]], and observed for no less than one hour.

All SCP-6090-A instances are to be prevented from exposure to light from a full moon[[footnote]]Including lunar eclipses.[[/footnote]], outside of experiments authorized by a researcher with Level 3 or higher clearance. Any SCP-6090-A instance that is exposed is to be guarded and closely monitored for any attempts to breach containment. All contact with exposed SCP-6090-A instances is strictly prohibited and any exposed SCP-6090-A instances that breach containment are to be terminated immediately. SCP-6090-A instances that exhibit excessive aggressive behavior outside of exposure are to be euthanized if deemed a threat to Foundation personnel.

All infected humans will henceforth be referred to as SCP-6090-B instances. To preserve the Veil of Secrecy, all SCP-6090-B instances are to be relocated to domiciles within anomalous communities under the terms of F.A.C.T.[[footnote]]The 1972 Freedom of Anomalous Communities Treaty between the Foundation and the [[[Unusual Incidents Unit Hub|U.I.U.]]], created and enacted not long after the Foundation&#39;s discovery of [[[Three Portlands Hub|Three Portlands]]]. When dealing with an SCP-6090-B instance residing outside the U.S., similar actions are to be taken in accordance with any similar agreements made with its home nation&#39;s government.[[/footnote]], unless Foundation containment is deemed necessary and permitted under its exception clauses.  All SCP-6090-B instances within the Foundation, contained or employed, are to be provided with appropriate amenities for their unique physiology, in addition to standard humanoid amenities.

SCP-6090-B instances contained by the Foundation are to be prevented from exposure to light from a full moon outside of experiments authorized by a researcher with Level 3 or higher clearance. SCP-6090-B instances employed by the Foundation are strongly advised to avoid exposure to full moonlight. Any SCP-6090-B instance that is exposed will be provided with any necessary mood suppressing medications, to be determined on an individual basis, and receive a psychological intervention if appropriate.





**Description:** SCP-6090 is a zoonotic blood-borne virus with universal tropism, known to affect all organisms in the phylum Chordata,[[footnote]]It is theorized by some to also affect organisms in the phylum Arthropoda and possibly even specific organisms in other phyla within the kingdom Animalia as well. Experimentation into these possibilities is still pending approval.[[/footnote]] though its effects are noticeably different in humans. The virus can only spread by direct bodily fluid contamination, and is only viable for up to 24 hours outside of a living host. The infection rate varies widely depending on the method of transmission and the species involved in the transmission.

--SCP-6090 is incurable in all cases.-- As of new findings made during and after Incident-6090-1, SCP-6090 can be cured in humans via an injection derived from venom produced by SCP-6090-B instances with infection source species in the genus Crotalus. This venom has been found to contain specialized toxins and oils that specifically target SCP-6090.

SCP-6090-A instances display no physiological changes or anomalous behavior, except when exposed to the light of a full moon. Any exposed instance will display increased aggression and anti-social behavior towards all other organisms. It will be compelled to seek out and attack humans in particular, even if it has had no prior human contact. When an SCP-6090-A instance fails to find humans after a varying length of time, or if it is in a situation that would not viably allow access to humans, it will instead proceed to seek out other animals to infect, usually its own species or species it typically preys upon.

When an animal is infected with SCP-6090, the virus seems to take on a template of parts of that animal&#39;s DNA. When an SCP-6090-A instance infects an animal of a different species, another new variant of the virus is created, with a new template fitting the DNA of the new SCP-6090-A instance. The sole exception to this is humans. When an SCP-6090-A instance infects a human, their variant&#39;s template overrides parts of the human&#39;s DNA with that of the animal species, transforming them into an SCP-6090-B instance. This transformation occurs extremely rapidly, taking no longer than 11 minutes. The mechanisms behind how SCP-6090 achieves this and why it affects humans differently are not fully understood, though current findings show that it integrates itself with human cells, becoming something akin to a new organelle within them.

SCP-6090-B instances are polymorphic entities with the ability to shape-shift, hereby referred to as **Therianthropes**. They can alter at will their physiology between a humanoid form and a specimen of the animal species that infected them. However, humans that become infected with SCP-6090 cannot return to their original non-anomalous human form. They typically have two forms which they are able to shape-shift between upon getting infected, though other intermediary forms may be obtained with practice:

* **Base Form:** The humanoid form and the one that new SCP-6090-B instances assume upon infection. The body is almost entirely human, except for a functional animal tail attached at the coccyx, and an animal-like head, also known as **Theriocephaly**.[[footnote]]**Theriocephaly** is a physiological condition in which the instance&#39;s head strongly resembles that of its infection source animal species, but with some human-like physiological structures persisting, particularly in the orbital region, supraorbital ridge, and internal oral region, which better facilitates facial expressions and speech. These human-animal-hybrid heads are capable of the full range of human facial expressions and are able to produce all human speech sounds, as well as most, if not all, of the sounds unique to their infection source species. The instance&#39;s head, C2 and C3 dermatomes are covered with the same fur, scales, feathers, or other skin growths typical of its infection source animal species. Its C4 dermatome is a transition between these skin growths and its human skin.[[/footnote]] SCP-6090-B instances have been found to have enhancements to their senses[[footnote]]And even additional new senses in the case of certain infection source species.[[/footnote]] and internal physiology, which can vary with the infection source animal species. Experiments with these enhancements are still ongoing, with investigations into their possible application to create specialized MTFs and field agents.

* **Feral Form:** The animal form, which is virtually indistinguishable from a specimen of the animal species that infected them. The only time it becomes apparent that this is an SCP-6090-B instance is when it shape-shifts its head to the same **Theriocephaly** physiology of its Base Form, or shape-shifts the extremities of its forelimbs to bear physiological similarities to human hands. This can happen involuntarily when an instance engages in simple human activities while in this form, such as talking or manipulating objects designed for humans.

* **Other Forms:** With practice, an SCP-6090-B instance can partially shape-shift its **Base Form** to possess further physiological traits of its **Feral Form**, beyond its head and tail.
 * **Nails:** The most commonly seen and easily attainable of this polymorphism is shape-shifting the nails of its extremities to possess a similar structure and properties to the equivalent claws, talons, hooves or other digit endpoints of their infection source animal species, including replicating the sub-unguis layer not present in human nails.
 * **Skin:** The second most common polymorphism is the ability to produce the same fur, scales, feathers or other skin growths of its infection source animal species over the skin of specific dermatomes or the entire body.
 * **Advanced:** More advanced polymorphism, which involves alterations to its underlying musculature and skeletal structure to create hybrid structures between human and its infection source species, is possible, but has been rarely observed, implying that extensive practice is needed to attain it. The most common amongst the limited observations is alteration of its leg structure to more closely resemble the hind limbs of its infection source animal species.

Upon infection, SCP-6090-B instances gain a natural proficiency for operating their **Feral Form** and shape-shifting into it with minimal conscious effort. SCP-6090-B instances also gain new instincts and behaviors specific to their infection source species, but these are not particularly compulsive or overpowering. In the case of some infection source species, some of these new instincts and behaviors may also manifest in the instance&#39;s **Base Form**, but to a much lesser extent than in its **Feral Form**.

As of new findings made during and after Incident-6090-1, it is theorized that SCP-6090-A instances of anomalous animal species pass on their anomalous traits to all SCP-6090-B instances they infect. This has been demonstrated with an infected instance of [[[SCP-3577]]]. Further experimentation with other anomalous animal species and SCP-6090 is still pending approval.

When exposed to the light of a full moon, SCP-6090-B are also compelled to spread SCP-6090 to other humans, though the compulsion is usually subtle and can be resisted easily. Most instances tend to describe it as &#34;an itch [it] can&#39;t scratch,&#34; though for some resistance is more difficult, requiring mood altering medication and psychological intervention. Investigation is still ongoing into possible correlations between an instance&#39;s level of compulsion and its personality and overall mental stability outside of full moonlight exposure.





**Addendum:** New findings obtained during Incident-6090-1 have led to the potential discovery of the origins of SCP-6090. It is now theorized to be an ancient bioweapon created by the Fae to act as a carrier for a Fae Curse. Investigations into this theory are still ongoing, and include the possibility that some inhabitants of [[[SCP-4000|the place that may only be described]]] are actually SCP-6090-B instances. It is also possible that the Shakespeare play, **//A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream//**, may in fact be the last remnant of a Test Log for SCP-6090 and other Fae-created chemical and biological weapons, with the character Nick Bottom being a test subject for SCP-6090 infection.

Logan,

I trust you&#39;ve arrived at the Clarita Longhorn Cattle Ranch by now. Please brief me on just how bad their coyote situation is. We need to know as quickly as possible if it could be another [[[SCP-3577|time travel situation]]], especially given all the weirdness that happens around Marfa after [[[SCP-1730|that one incident]]] the Supervisors won&#39;t tell us much about. If that town wasn&#39;t weird enough before, it&#39;s certainly more so now. You&#39;d think they&#39;d realize their tight lips about stuff like this only works against our efforts.

Tell me about it! Especially with all the Alaskan critters still running around and messing up the local ecosystem. Been years and we still haven&#39;t gotten that bit completely under control yet.

Anyway, there&#39;s definitely more yotes out there than there should be, at least a few dozen, but we can&#39;t be sure they&#39;re the time-hopping kind til we&#39;ve trapped a few. Spent the day looking round, asking round, and tracking them down. Yotes have been running round the ranch like they own the place, but things got really crazy last night.

We were all out in the twilight, trying to catch glimpses of the super moon eclipse before sunrise. We were also trying to round up some of the yotes while doing that, when one of them broke off from the pack and charged right at us! Scary as hell! Had to blow the poor thing&#39;s head off cause it wouldn&#39;t stop trying to bite us. Might have been rabid, so I&#39;ll have to keep that in mind when trapping the rest. Hope we don&#39;t have to put down any more.

Logan,

Understood. If you didn&#39;t damage its brain too badly, please attempt to test it for rabies. Time travelling coyotes would be bad enough, but time travelling coyotes retroactively spreading rabies around would be even worse. Keep me posted on the situation as often as possible.

Welp.................................. SHITS HIT THE FAN NOW.

Turns out these are definitely time hopping yotes, and they are definitely infected, but with something much worse than rabies. Rabies woulda been bad, but it don&#39;t BREAK THE VEIL like the WERE-VIRUS does. One of the ranch hands, Sandy Collins, woke up with a yote head and tail, and I ain&#39;t talking godfather style here. Her morning screams woke the whole house up. Had to spend most of the day calming her down.

Finally went back and checked our notes after supper, and sure enough there are now copies of them with extra notes about extra yotes. Lucky we also had video of the scene, because of the eclipse. Went back to look at it and yeah, there was a 2nd video file, and it showed 4 crazed yotes coming at us this time. Put them all down, but one got lucky and managed to bite Sandy, and her changes are on that video too.

I&#39;ve forwarded this whole chain to Bard as well. Hopefully he can get his fluffy tail down here and help handle this situation.

Logan,

Thank you for contacting Dr. Dalton, as I would have if you hadn&#39;t, but I wholeheartedly agree with your initial statement. I&#39;m going to gather up as many volunteers as I can and send them down your way, but this situation is now definitely way over our heads. I&#39;ve already contacted the Supervisors, and the Castaways should be out there around the same time Dr. Dalton arrives with whoever else I can find.

We got lucky that whatever vector gave them the Therianthropy Virus likely passed through within the last month. If it had been further back into the two years that have been altered, half the town might have woken up as Therianthropes, especially with the spectacle of a lunar eclipse causing them all to go outside and drop their guard. Wilson himself might have had to take the reins then, and he still might end up having to take them now.

You and everyone else out there need to trap all of the coyotes as quickly as possible, and then examine literally every animal you see out there for coyote injuries. Do as much as you can before the cavalry arrives. I DON&#39;T CARE WHAT IT TAKES.

Deputize the entire ranch if you have to, since they&#39;re now inside the Veil of Secrecy anyway. To put it bluntly, we&#39;ve just been thrown into a logistical shit storm, and it will only get worse with each Coyote Courtship that&#39;s allowed to complete. THE COYOTES ARE YOUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY in order to keep this event from getting any worse than it already is.

Logan and Randy,

Yep, quite the sticky wicket we&#39;ve got on our hands now. I&#39;ve already phoned up some of the therians[[footnote]]**Therian** is a common shorthand for **Therianthrope**.[[/footnote]] I know, and I&#39;m working on getting some more to volunteer. Next full moon&#39;s a ways away, but best not to take chances. Can&#39;t get infected if you&#39;re already infected, after all! We&#39;ll be down there in just a few shakes. Keep me posted until then!

Really been booking it the last day and a half. Night and day, we&#39;ve been tracking yotes down, snaring them up, and snipping their bits before we even throw them into pens. A good three dozen so far, so there shouldn&#39;t be many more out there. Here&#39;s hoping that&#39;ll nip this shit in the bud.

The rest of the ranch has been checking all their animals from tip to tail for signs of bites. All except for Sandy, who naturally needed some time alone.

So far we&#39;ve found at least 3 longhorns, 4 fallow, and a [[span class=&#34;poisonHighlight&#34;]]rattler[[/span]] that was under the house. Got them all penned up from the rest. Will keep you posted on any more we find until the cavalry arrives tomorrow.

Logan,

I appreciate your update to the situation, and you have no idea how relieved I am to know that you&#39;re already getting everything under control. I knew I was right in picking you to lead this project.

I am now in active contact with the Supervisors on more secure channels. I suggest we end this email chain before they arrive. As much as I hate how tight-lipped they are with us, this is something that we should all try to stay tight-lipped about.

End of Correspondence
[[/div]]
[[/div]]

Official correspondence between Mr. Wessler, Dr. Davies, and Dr. Dalton ceased after this final message. From 5/29/2021 onward, Dr. Davies began relaying updates over closed circuit secure channels with Foundation liaisons for GoI-466. The severity of a potential retroactive mass outbreak of SCP-6090 via infected [[[SCP-3577]]] instances warranted the immediate mobilization of 5 operatives of MTF Beta-4 (&#34;Castaways&#34;) to lead the efforts, along with 4 additional Foundation General Researchers experienced in anomalous outbreaks. A road convoy of 4 Mobile Lab Trailers, 6 LAAT Trailers[[footnote]]Standard Foundation Large Anomalous Animal Transport Trailer: A modified, armor reinforced livestock trailer.[[/footnote]] and 4 Security Support Trailers was arranged and deployed from Site-64, in order to test for SCP-6090 infection on-site, transport all SCP-6090-A instances back to Site-64, and recontain or neutralize them if they should escape en-route.

Accompanying the Foundation personnel were 27 volunteers and employees of GoI-466. Amongst them were 11 instances of SCP-6090-B, including Dr. Dalton, who were required to remain in Feral Form while outside any structure controlled by the Foundation or GoI-466. The SCP-6090-B instances covertly assisted in the capture of the remaining SCP-3577 instances and wild animals suspected of being SCP-6090-A instances. The remaining volunteers assisted in testing every animal present on the Clarita Longhorn Cattle Ranch and all neighboring ranches within a 10-kilometer radius for SCP-6090, under the cover story of a potential livestock disease outbreak.

After two days of investigation, it was assessed that SCP-6090-B-4342, Sandra Collins, could potentially possess the same anomalous traits as [[[SCP-3577]]] instances. This is the first documented case of an anomalous animal becoming infected with SCP-6090 and then infecting a human. If confirmed, this would present an unprecedented opportunity to study SCP-3577&#39;s abilities from a perspective of sapience, as well as warrant further experimentation with SCP-6090 and anomalous animals. Clearance was obtained for a vanguard portion of the road convoy to transport SCP-6090-B-4342 to Site-64 for further questioning and testing, along with all SCP-6090-A instances captured so far. Two Foundation Researchers and Dr. Dalton accompanied it to perform an initial assessment en-route to Site-64. The reminder of the road convoy, Foundation personnel, and GoI-466 affiliates stayed at the affected area to continue the clean-up efforts.

**Section 2: Interview Log:**





[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Interview Log 6090-1A&#34; hide=&#34;- Close Document&#34;]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Interviewed:** Sandra Collins
Instance SCP-6090-B-4342, ISS: //Canis latrans//[[footnote]]Infection Source Species: Common Coyote.[[/footnote]]

**Interviewers:**
Dr. Evelynn Antleur, Foundation General Researcher, Level 3
Dr. Atticus Rateleken, Foundation Therianthropy Researcher, Level 3
Dr. Bardolph Dalton, Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions Employee
Instance SCP-6090-B-863, ISS: //Canis lupus//[[footnote]]Infection Source Species: Gray Wolf.[[/footnote]]

**Foreword:** Video log transcript of initial interview and testing, to attempt to determine if SCP-6090-B-4342 possesses similar retroactive reality-bending abilities to those of instances of [[[SCP-3577]]].

**Note:** Interview is being conducted while en-route back to Site-64, within a Standard Foundation Mobile Lab. Dr. Dalton and Dr. Antleur are seated opposite to SCP-6090-B-4342, with a guard stationed in a corner under standard security protocols. Dr. Rateleken is seated in another corner, as only a partial participant to the interview.

----

**&lt;Begin Log, 2021-06-03 03:42 PST&gt;**

**Dr. Antleur:** State your name for the record please.

**SCP-6090-B-4342:** Sandra Collins, but you can call me Sandy.

**Dr. Antleur:** Thank you. However, I will be addressing you by your SCP-6090-B Instance Identification Number, 4342.

(//Dr. Dalton softly barks and mutters quietly.//)

**Dr. Dalton:** Might as well call me 963 then.

**Dr. Rateleken:** Heh, you really are as cold as they say.

**Dr. Antleur:** (//Sighs//) And you obviously aren&#39;t taking this seriously.

**4342:** Umm... I really would prefer Sandy.

**Dr. Dalton:** Well, I&#39;ll be calling you Sandy for this interview.

(//Dr. Dalton smiles at 4342. 4342 appears happier and its ears perk up.//)

**Dr. Rateleken:** If you really are as good as they say, Dr. Antleur, you&#39;ll treat Sandy with some respect. I know this mission hasn&#39;t been fun for you, since it seems you hate animals, but at least it&#39;s almost over for you.

**Dr. Antleur:** My lack of an affinity for animals is not a topic of this interview. If you are quite done with this pointless banter, I would prefer to return to the actual interview.

**Dr. Dalton:** I know we&#39;re all overtired from this non-stop road trip, but let&#39;s all try to be nice here.

**Dr. Rateleken:** Fine. Boring conversation anyway. If it&#39;s all the same, I&#39;ll just hang back for now. I don&#39;t have any pressing questions for Ms. Collins at this time, and Bard is taking point on anything Therianthropy related.

(//Dr. Rateleken exchanges a smile and nod with Dr. Dalton.//)

**Dr. Rateleken:** Really, I&#39;m just trying to kill time until we get back to Site-64, so I can more thoroughly examine the SCP-6090-A instances we&#39;ve got with us, especially this little guy.

(//Dr. Rateleken pats a SAACU[[footnote]]Small Anomalous Animal Containment Unit.[[/footnote]] next to him. An audible rattle starts and speeds up.//)

**Dr. Rateleken:** First ever venomous SCP-6090-A instance recovered by the Foundation. Oh, I am excited!

(//Dr. Antleur rolls her eyes.//)

**Dr. Antleur:** Now, 4342, how has your overall mental state been affected since waking up as an SCP-6090-B instance?

(//4342 growls softly.//)

**4342:** I think I would rather answer questions from Bard for now.

**Dr. Antleur:** Hmph. Very well then. You may proceed, Dr. Dalton.

**Dr. Dalton:** Heh, at least you&#39;re giving me the dignity of my name, though I get the feeling that&#39;s only because I&#39;m on this side of the table.

**Dr. Dalton:** Anyway, onto questions. How&#39;ve you been holding up, love?

(//4342 looks down and reaches up to feel her face. Dr. Dalton frowns.//)

**4342:** It still doesn&#39;t feel real. None of this does. I keep thinking any moment I&#39;m going to wake up with my old face again, and this&#39;ll all have been some bizarre fever dream. But I&#39;ve woken up five times now, more if I count my naps, and every time it&#39;s still there. It&#39;s all still there. I&#39;ll never look like myself again.

(//4342 shuts its eyes. Its ears droop and lips start to quiver. Dr. Dalton gently touches her other hand resting on the table.//)

**Dr. Dalton:** No worries. It&#39;ll all be alright. I promise, after this, I&#39;ll personally introduce you to a Therian Support Group. There are plenty of us out there.

(//4342 sniffs and moves its hand to wipe its nose, missing it on the first attempt.//)

**4342:** Thanks. Meeting the other Therian volunteers really helped. I&#39;m much better off than I was that first night. When exactly will this all be over?

**Dr. Antleur:** That all depends on the results of these tests. They may warrant further tests and continued containment.

**SCP-6090-B-4342:** And how long will that last?

**Dr. Antleur:** Again, it depends on the results of these tests. Further testing may be required on-site.

(//Dr. Dalton pats 4342&#39;s hand a few times.//)

**Dr. Dalton:** If there are more tests, I&#39;m sure they won&#39;t take long.

(//4342 smiles at Bard. Its ears perk back up.//)

**Dr. Antleur:** We need to determine if you possess similar retroactive reality-altering abilities as the anomalous coyote that infected you. If confirmed, we will further test the extent of your abilities.

**4342:** I still don&#39;t understand what any of that means.

**Dr. Antleur:** You don&#39;t have to. Simply follow the instructions we give you.

**4342:** Okay. Whatever will get me out of &#34;containment&#34; as soon as possible. Things&#39;ll never be the same, but at least you&#39;ve shown me I can still live on looking like this.

**Dr. Dalton:** I can guarantee there will always be a place for you in Boring. We can always use more people on team WWS.

**4342:** Thanks, but I really hope there&#39;s one of these &#34;Anomalous Communities&#34; you mentioned somewhere in Texas, or at least in the Southwest.

**Dr. Dalton:** I&#39;m sure I could find something for you down there too. WWS has set up shop all over the place. Anomalous critters aren&#39;t limited to Oregon.

**Dr. Antleur:** (//Clears throat.//) Once again, could we all please return to the actual topic of this interview?

**Dr. Dalton:** Guess we should get on with it.

**Dr. Antleur:** Now, 4342, are you ready to for this test?

**4342:** (//Sighs.//) I really wish you&#39;d call me Sandy, but fine, I&#39;m ready.

**Dr. Antleur:** I want you to think back to a specific date you went &#39;window shopping&#39; within the last two years, no earlier than June of 2019, preferably a date in the latter half of 2019. We believe older, vaguer memories may work better for this test, and doing anything in 2020 was rather... complicated, to say the least.

**4342:** Ugh, tell me about it! I&#39;ll be glad when that&#39;s all over too. Anyway, yeah, I think I have a date in mind, back in October 2019.

**Dr. Antleur:** Now I want you to think of a particular item that caught your eye on that date, something that you could afford at the time and considered purchasing, but didn&#39;t. To ensure success, please try to limit it to something that would fit into that small backpack of yours.

(//Dr. Antleur gestures to a backpack sitting inside the chamber of a scientific scale on shock absorbers.//)

**4342:** Yeah, there was a pair of binoculars I really wanted. A bit pricey, but I could&#39;ve bought them with my credit card. I just wasn&#39;t sure how long I&#39;d still have my job at the time. Luckily, I managed to get my contract extended. If I&#39;d known that back then, I would&#39;ve definitely bought them.

**Dr. Antleur:** Good. Finally, did you use a cloud-based digital calendar at that time, one that you still have access to?

**4342:** I&#39;m still using the same account I did back then, so yeah.

**Dr. Antleur:** I need you to access that calendar via your phone and create a new event for that past date, specifying that you&#39;ll buy those binoculars.

**4342:** Heh, guess I can do that, since the app does let you add events to the past, though it all seems rather silly.

**Dr. Antleur:** Despite what you may think, I need you to abandon those notions for the next step. Assign the highest priority you can to the event, add multiple reminders, and compose it in a way that you would have back then, with positive affirmations that you //will// buy those binoculars and you //will// be able to settle the debt.

**4342:** Alright, but reception&#39;s kinda spotty and we&#39;re in a metal truck trailer rolling down the road.

**Dr. Rateleken:** Just connect to our WiFi. We have a military grade sat link, but you&#39;ll have to place your phone flat on the table so we can see its screen. Security protocols and all that.

**4342:** Okay, what&#39;s the password?

**Dr. Rateleken:** [REDACTED]

**4342:** Heh, seriously?

(//4342 removes its phone from its pocket and follows instructions.//)

**Dr. Antleur:** I need you to do your best to imagine as though you&#39;re back in 2019, and you&#39;re making this entry prior to its date.

**4342:** Again, this is silly, and it&#39;s still a bit difficult to think back to anything before five days ago.

**Dr. Antleur:** You still need to try.

(//4342 waves its hand over its face again, trying not to hit its muzzle. Dr. Dalton nods sympathetically.//)

**Dr. Dalton:** It&#39;s okay there, love. Focus on the past for now, and I&#39;ll be here when you snap back to the present.

**Dr. Antleur:** We are simply trying to replicate as closely as possible the only documented instance of a human utilizing the anomalous abilities of SCP-3577, in order to eliminate as many uncontrolled variables as we can.

**4342:** Yeah, yeah, I got it. Scientific method and all that.

**Dr. Antleur:** Try to get as excited about it as you can. The more enthusiasm the better. Think of it like you&#39;re getting yourself an early Christmas present.

(//4342 takes a deep breath and stares intently into its phone, angling its head so it can&#39;t see its reflection. It smiles as it begins to compose the calendar entry. It bounces in its seat a little.//)

**4342:** Aaaand done! Now what?

**Dr. Antleur:** Stay focused on your phone. Don&#39;t take your eyes off that event in the app. Keep concentrating on how excited you are to buy those binoculars, and everything you&#39;ll do with them once you have them, and how you&#39;ll always keep them with you. Don&#39;t stop until instructed to do so.

**4342:** Got it!

(//83 seconds pass. An alarm goes off. The backpack&#39;s weight increases by 0.8 kg.//)

**4342:** Holy shit, it actually worked?!

(//The guard points his gun at the backpack. Dr. Antleur puts on a face shield and heavy duty gloves. Dr. Dalton and 4342 look confused, each tilting their head and perking one ear up.//)

**4342:** Ummm, is all this really necessary?

**Dr. Rateleken:** Heh, welcome to the Foundation. That extra weight could be binoculars, or it could be a hostile entity from another dimension. Luckily, I haven&#39;t seen it move, so the chances of that are steadily decreasing. Still, don&#39;t ever underestimate the possibilities, even if they&#39;re under a kilo. A face hugger probably weighs around that much.

(//4342 laughs, looks around the room and stops. Dr. Rateleken waves a scanner around the outside of the scale, opens the scale chamber and waves it around again. He then scoots over and checks some papers.//)

**Dr. Rateleken:** Yep, there&#39;s now a second copy of my notes! This one has a different weight for the backpack, the one on the scale now, and a pair of binoculars weighing 0.8 kilos has been added to the contents list.

(//Dr. Antleur pulls the backpack out of the scale chamber by its strap, waves the scanner around it, sets it down in front of the guard and slowly opens it. Each item is checked against both lists. Dr. Antleur holds the binoculars up to her eyes and adjusts them.//)

**Dr. Antleur:** It does appear to be a functional, non-anomalous pair of binoculars. Military grade. Rather nice.

**4342:** You bet they are! Now come on, let me try them!

(//Dr. Antleur rolls her eyes and hands 4342 the binoculars. 4342 bounces in its seat, grabs them and puts them up to its eyes.//)

**4342:** Freaking sweet! As advertised, though I can&#39;t really put them through their paces inside this cramped trailer.

(//4342 looks around, refocusing the binoculars on every object in the lab trailer. It angles them down and they bump against its muzzle. It freezes and all happiness drains from its face. Its ears droop down and it sets them on the table. It reaches up and rubs its muzzle.//)

**4342:** Oh... right... I guess my mind really was back in 2019 for a moment there. My muzzle&#39;s been there long enough that I sometimes forget it&#39;s there.

**Dr. Dalton:** I&#39;m here for you, love. You can take all the time you need before they perform anymore tests.

**Dr. Antleur:** Keep in mind that we //will// need to conduct more tests now. We&#39;ve confirmed you have similar abilities to SCP-3577. We need to gauge their full extent, and hopefully learn more about SCP-3577 in the process.

(//4342 stares down at the otherwise ordinary object she managed to somehow pull out of the past.//)

**4342:** As if things weren&#39;t already weird enough. Now it turns out I can time travel too.

**Dr. Rateleken:** Again, welcome to the Foundation. We hope you enjoy your stay.

**4342:** I hope that stay won&#39;t be too long.

**Dr. Antleur:** The duration of your containment will depend on the results of further tests. For now, there is one more test we can perform while en-route to Site-64. We will repeat the previous test, but without using a visual aid as a focusing mechanism. Instead, you&#39;ll visualize it in your mind.

**4342:** Okay, I can try.

**Dr. Antleur:** Once again, I need you to think of another date in late 2019 when you went...

(//Loud radio chatter on the guard&#39;s comm. Dr. Antleur glares at him. He gets up and opens an observation slot.//)

**CSR-07:** Those trees look way too closely packed to me. Over.

**4342:** Woah, this trailer has windows?! Sweet, I can field test these after all!

(//4342 grabs her binoculars and runs over to the window.//)

**Dr. Antleur:** Excuse me, but what is the meaning of this interruption?

**CSR-07:** Sorry ma&#39;am, the drivers noticed an unusual increase in tree density. Probably nothing but a reforestation project. Just trying to confirm this.

**4342:** Yeah, you&#39;re right. Lot of trees, but no redwoods. Huh, what&#39;s that up in the sk...

(//Video shakes and goes black. Shouting, screaming and vehicle crash noises.//)

**CSR-03:** And yet long-haul truckers manage this all the time.

**CSR-04:** Pssh, yeah, with hard drugs. And you&#39;re one to talk, since you actually got some sleep.

**CSR-03:** If you can count three hours as &#39;sleep.&#39; I hate long road trips.

**CSR-04:** At least now we&#39;re just a few hours out from the site. Then we can both take some libo.[[footnote]]Liberty. Off-duty time for soldiers.[[/footnote]]

**CSR-03:** Heh, I actually wanted to see some action. These animal missions really are the epitome of the //Boring// Agreement&#39;s name.

**CSR-04:** Yeah, I wish more of those &#39;Castaways&#39; would learn some damn combat skills so they could handle this shit.

**CSR-03:** Pretty sure the Captain wanted to see some action too, considering he dragged a freaking Gauss Rifle along with us.

**CSR-04:** Still not sure how he pulled that one off for a mission like this, but I bet he&#39;s even more bored than we are right now.

**CSR-03:** I&#39;m so bored I&#39;ve started counting trees!

**CSR-04:** Huh, there are definitely a lot more to count now. I don&#39;t remember there being this many in this part of No-Cal.

**CSR-03:** Really? I thought this part of Cali was nothing but trees.

**CSR-04:** Yeah, but not this many, at least not when I was last here. Thought it was just highway hypnosis playing with my head.

**CSR-03:** Eh, probably just a reforestation project.

**CSR-04:** If it is, it&#39;s a real shitty one. Trees that close together are a fire hazard.

**CSR-03:** Heh, and so&#39;s not raking the leaves between them.

**CSR-04:** I&#39;m serious. You hang around with these nature boys long enough, you pick up some things. I think I&#39;m gonna call it in.

**CSR-03:** You&#39;re gonna piss off the Captain, but it&#39;s your funeral, not mine.

**CSR-04:** Cap, I&#39;m noticing unusually high tree density. Copy?

**CSR-Cap:** Four, did you just break radio silence to play freaking eye-spy?

**CSR-04:** Please confirm with the team, just in case.

**CSR-Cap:** (//Sighs.//) All guards: visual check. Clock convoy&#39;s three and nine. Anything unusual?

**CSR-06:** I only see trees.

**CSR-07:** Those trees look way too closely packed to me.

**CSR-01:** Lot more trees than I remember from a month back.

(//Faint sound of cracking asphalt.//)

**CSR-Cap:** One, please clarify.

**CSR-01:** Was on this road back in April. There were barely any trees then.

**CSR-Cap:** Either this is one fast and sloppy reforestation proj...

(//VEHICLE CRASH NOISES.//)

(//Recovered video footage shows many root-like protrusions, up to 3 meters in height and 0.5 meters in diameter, sprouting through the road pavement, directly underneath the vehicles. All three trucks are immobile and severely damaged.//)

**CSR-Cap:** Status report!

**CSR-03:** Uninjured. Exiting Truck 1 cabin. No sign of hostiles.

**CSR-04:** Still alive and joining Three. Can&#39;t see any hostiles either.

**CSR-02:** I&#39;m good! But Site Comm&#39;s down. We can&#39;t call for help.

**CSR-01:** Good here! No hostiles spotted yet.

**CSR-08:** I&#39;m okay, but civilian status unknown. Don&#39;t see any hostiles near Trailer 3. Lucky.

**CSR-Cap:** Five, Six, Seven, status? Civilian status? Do you read?

**CSR-08:** Gonna check civilian status, but I already got visual on Trailer 2 and it&#39;s real bad. Snapped in half like a giant candy bar by those... roots?

**CSR-Cap:** Damn, those are some tough roots.

**CSR-08:** Animals look dead or gone. No visual on Truck 2.

**CSR-01:** I got visual on Truck 2. It&#39;s pointed straight up and crushed into Trailer 2. Can&#39;t confirm status of Five and Six.

**CSR-02:** Trailer 1&#39;s battery case&#39;s ruptured. There&#39;s a fire!

**CSR-01:** Shit, you&#39;re right. It&#39;s going up fast.

**CSR-Cap:** Get out what you can outta there!

**CSR-02:** Even the Gauss?

**CSR-Cap:** Especially the Gauss! Busted my ass requisitioning that from the QM.[[footnote]]The QuarterMaster General, responsible for loaning out equipment, ordinances and armaments to MTFs and the security detail on missions, among other logistics.[[/footnote]]

**CSR-03:** Getting the Gauss and its mag now. Not sure how we&#39;ll power it.

**CSR-Cap:** Hope we don&#39;t need it, and hope Trailer 3 still has power if we do.

**CSR-08:** Confirmed, Trailer 3 has power. I can see its lights.

**CSR-Cap:** Good, hopefully they stay on. And its S.R.A.?

**CSR-08:** Completely FUBAR.[[footnote]]Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition.[[/footnote]]

**CSR-02:** Dammit! Trailer 1&#39;s S.R.A.&#39;s also down.

**CSR-01:** Wouldn&#39;t matter much. Whole thing&#39;s about to be in flames.

**CSR-04:** I&#39;m getting the Mini!

**CSR-Cap:** I got what I could! Regroup around Trailer 3.

**CSR-02:** Taking up position now!

**CSR-04:** Going there now. Still no sign of hostiles, but I&#39;ll be setting up the Mini.

**CSR-03:** Heading over there too. Hope its battery and aux plug are intact.

**CSR-01:** Should I attempt to climb up and check for Five and Six?

**CSR-Cap:** Do it en-route over to Trailer 3 if you can.

**CSR-01:** Roger that!

**CSR-08:** Got visual on the Civilians. Shit, Dr. A got infected! She&#39;s a fucking deer now.

**CSR-Cap:** Fan-fucking-tastic. And the rest?

**CSR-08:** They all look alive. No severe injuries, but Dr. R is trapped. You injured, Doc?

**Dr. Rateleken:** I&#39;m stuck, but okay. Got lucky. Couple more centimeters and I might have been gutted.

**CSR-08:** Try not to move then, and for fuck&#39;s sake, put your phone down.

**Dr. Rateleken:** But I&#39;m taking notes on this incident.

(//CSR-08 sighs.//)

**Dr. Rateleken:** Did you guys pack the Jaws of Life?

**CSR-08:** If we did, it&#39;s inside a battery fire now.

**CSR-Cap:** Status on Seven?

**CSR-08:** Seven&#39;s trapped worse than Dr. A, and he&#39;s injured. Seven, you alive? Wake the fuck up!

(//Slapping.//)

**CSR-07:** (//Coughs.//) Reporting. I&#39;m awake.

**CSR-Cap:** Can you access his wounds?

**CSR-08:** Nope, stuck under one of these roots. Might be what&#39;s keeping him from bleeding out.

**CSR-07:** I&#39;m really stuck. Can&#39;t get out, but I can at least move my other arm and point my gun.

**CSR-Cap:** Roger that. Protect the civilians if hostiles start showing.

**CSR-07:** I will until my last breath. (//Coughs.//)

**CSR-01:** Got visual on Five and Six, and it&#39;s a SNAFU.[[footnote]]Situation Normal: All Fucked Up.[[/footnote]] Six is definitely dead. Five is unresponsive and underneath a dead steer.

**CSR-Cap:** Is Five alive?

**CSR-01:** Can&#39;t get to him to tell you. There&#39;s a lot of blood, but I can&#39;t tell how much of it is his.

**CSR-Cap:** Understood. Leave them and join the rest of us.

**CSR-01:** Got it, heading over. Weird that the battery fire hasn&#39;t spre... SHIT! HOSTILE! SIX O&#39;CLOCK! UP IN THE FUCKING AIR!

**CSR-08:** Confirmed! Hostile entity 50+ meters from trailer&#39;s six, floating 20+ meters off the ground.

(//Guns cocking.//)

**CSR-03:** Dammit, I still haven&#39;t gotten the Gauss set up.

**CSR-04:** The Mini&#39;s good to go. Just say the word, Cap.

**CSR-Cap:** ATTENTION UNKNOWN ENTITY! IDENTIFY YOURSELF!

(//Distant cackling.//)

[Video footage from Trailer 3 Rear Camera.]

**&lt;Begin Log, 2021-06-03 04:08 PST (BMNT + 10)&gt;**

(//Unknown humanoid entity floats forward and downward, its standing pose unchanging.//)

**CSR-02:** Shit, I really wish the S.R.A. still worked.

**Unknown Entity:** Good morning, gentlemen. You may call me Belette Le Fou(ine).

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) doffs its sequined bowler hat, holds it to its chest, and takes a bow. His head is clearly musteline.//)

**CSR-08:** What the fuck? Is it a were-weasel?

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) stands upright and dons its hat. It chuckles and golf claps as it floats closer.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Ah, yes, very astute! I am indeed a Weasel Therianthrope. Sharp eyes you have there.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) touches down on the ground, 10 meters from the trailer. It appears to be dressed in a tuxedo. Its cane appears to be crafted from a tree branch, but with a gun trigger under its handle.//)

**CSR-Cap:** Stand down! This is your only warning!

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) grins. Its teeth are brightly reflective.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Gentlemen, and ladies, I have journeyed here this fine morning... in order to take your lives.

**CSR-02:** Like hell you will!

(//CSR-02 fires 3 rounds at Belette Le Fou(ine). The bullets stop mid-air a few centimeters from his torso. Floating green kinetoglyphs[[footnote]]**Kinetoglyphs** are visual manifestations of **Kinetohazards**, which are gestures and motions that interact with multiple spatial dimensions simultaneously. Kinetohazards allow the entity performing them to create physical and mental hazards, and can be as subtle as wiggling fingers or even blinking in a specific pattern. A Kinetohazard can be counteracted by motions and gestures that follow an inverse pattern, or by a physical representation of symbols that are the inverse of its resulting kinetoglyphs. These are known as **Antikinetohazards** and **Antikinetoglyphs**, respectively. Please refer to &#34;Kinetology and the Study of Kinetocism, 2nd Ed,&#34; by Dr. ████████, for further details.[[/footnote]] manifest around them. He slides back on the pavement from their momentum, not even flinching. The kinetoglyphs vanish and the bullets drop to the ground.//)

**CSR-02:** What the fuck?!

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) giggles. It levitates off the ground and starts flying towards CSR-02, doing a twirl. The only sound is its clothes fluttering in the wind.//)

**CSR-Cap:** Two and Eight, open fire!

(//CSR-02, CSR-08 and CSR-Cap open fire on Belette Le Fou(ine). The bullets collide with the kinetoglyphs. Belette Le Fou(ine) is pushed further backwards, but no bullets hit him.//)

**CSR-08:** Fuck, that&#39;s a strong kinetohazard!

**CSR-03:** Wish Five were here. He knew the most about this bullshit.

**CSR-Cap:** Anyone else know how to counter it?

**CSR-08:** Not familiar with those glyphs.

**CSR-02:** Don&#39;t know them either.

**CSR-04:** Negative. All Greek to me.

**CSR-01:** Nope.

**CSR-Cap:** Dammit!

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) cackles and raises his cane, revealing a gun barrel in its base. It fires 2 shots at CSR-08: the 2nd enters his chest. The bullet doesn&#39;t exit his body, but its momentum throws him backwards out of frame.//)

**CSR-Cap:** Four, overload the K-H[[footnote]]Kinetohazard.[[/footnote]]! Hit him hard!

**CSR-04:** Try to stop this!

(//CSR-04 starts the Minigun. Belette Le Fou(ine) makes arcane gestures with its other hand as a hail of bullets hit the kinetoglyphs; their green glow intensifies. Not a single bullet reaches its body. It starts to be pushed back. It lands back on the ground and slows to a stop. It starts slowly strolling towards the trailer.//)

**CSR-Cap:** Pump it up! Divide and conquer!

(//CSR-04 maxes out the Minigun firing rate. Belette Le Fou(ine) slows down, but keeps moving forward, leaving piles of bullets on both sides of its path. CSR-01 and CSR-02 come into view on both sides of the frame behind it and fire their M4s at its back. It rapidly alternates looking over its shoulders while pushed back by the barrage of bullets. It cackles and takes to the air, flying out of frame.//)

**CSR-02:** Fuck, it&#39;s fast!

**CSR-01:** Flying like a fucking trapeze without ropes.

(//Loud cackling. Bullets hit the ground near the Minigun and shatter the pavement.//)

**CSR-04:** Shit!

(//CSR-04 jumps back as 3 bullets hit the ground around the Minigun, and a 4th goes through its motor compartment. The Minigun flies apart and its spinning barrel bounces away. Various vines and plants begin to sprout and grow out of each impact spot. Vines completely cover the Minigun parts and flowers bloom from them.//)

**CSR-04:** Just as well, it was almost out of rounds anyw...

(//A bullet misses CSR-04&#39;s head, but a 2nd enters his skull and backflips his body onto his chest. Brambles grow out of his head wound and every orifice of his face, including his eye sockets. They engulf his body and bloom roses. Belette Le Fou(ine) descends back into frame and lands on the ground. Kinetoglyphs appear in different positions behind it as CSR-01 and CSR-02 try to find a weak spot.//)

**CSR-03:** Captain, the Gauss is good to go!

**CSR-Cap:** Fire it now!

(//Gauss rifle whirrs loudly as it charges. Trailer&#39;s internal lights flicker off. Some static from camera switching to internal power.//)

**CSR-03:** Eat shit, motherfucker!

(//Gauss rifle fires and Trailer&#39;s lights flicker back on. The largest kinetoglyphs yet appear in front of Belette Le Fou(ine). It&#39;s pushed over 100 meters down the road, passing CSR-01 and CSR-02. It tucks its cane under its arm and stops smiling. It wildly gesticulates around the bullet in floating front of it, making blurry distortions in space and shredding it apart. As the giant kinetoglyphs disappear, one lucky M4 round grazes its leg. It yelps in pain and grabs its thigh.//)

**CSR-01:** Yes! We finally h...

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) smiles wickedly and fires 6 rounds with his other hand. One sends CSR-01 flying through the air and 2 more spin him as he flies. He ragdoll flops down the road and stops in front of the trailer. An entire flower garden grows out of his corpse.//)

**CSR-03:** How can it still focus with that wound?!

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) rapidly flies towards the trailer. It aims its cane at CSR-02 as the Gauss Rifle recharges. CSR-02 fires a few rounds at its face, obstructing its vision with its own kinetoglyphs. It fires off 5 rounds at CSR-02 before one hits him.//)

**CSR-Cap:** At least we got it on the ropes! Fire again!

(//Gauss rifle fires. Belette Le Fou(ine) is pushed back 80 meters down the road. It tucks away its cane and starts gesticulating. CSR-Cap fires a few rounds at its legs, but they get caught up in the same Kinetohazard.//)

**CSR-Cap:** Shit, looks like we gotta thread that needle. Keep firing at it in succession. Do not let up!

**CSR-03:** The Gauss&#39;ll slow down recharging to keep from burning out its capacitors.

**CSR-Cap:** Any way to disable that?

**CSR-03:** Not that I know of.

**CSR-Cap:** Dammit!

**CSR-03:** I&#39;ve gotten a feel for it now. I think I can try to max its RoF.

**CSR-Cap:** Good. Keeping firing until you run out of ammo or juice.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) cackles and levitates out of frame.//)

**CSR-03:** Not this invisible trapeze bullshit again!

**CSR-Cap:** Can you keep a bead on him?

**CSR-03:** I&#39;m trying!

(//Gauss rifle fires. Loud cackling. M4 fires.//)

**CSR-Cap:** Almost got the timing down, though it probably won&#39;t stay still now.

(//Gauss rifle fires. Loud giggling. M4 fires.//)

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) lands 20 meters from the trailer and raises its cane.//)

**CSR-03:** Looks like it can&#39;t stay in the air too long.

(//CSR-Cap swaps out his magazine.//)

**CSR-Cap:** I think I got it now. Gonna try a burst shot. Hopefully something hits.

**CSR-03:** Trailer battery&#39;s getting low. Make it count.

**CSR-Cap:** You too!

(//Gauss rifle fires. Belette Le Fou(ine) tucks its cane and gesticulates the kinetohazard in a clean motion as it&#39;s pushed to 50 meters away.//)

**CSR-Cap:** Yeah, keep on smiling, you son of a bitch.

(//CSR-Cap takes careful aim and fires a full auto burst right as the giant kinetoglyphs start fading away. Belette Le Fou(ine) swings its cane into its hand and fires three rounds at the same time. One lucky bullet carves out part of its forearm before the rest are blocked by smaller kinetoglyphs. It screams in pain and drops its cane as one of its fired rounds hits CSR-Cap.//)

**CSR-Cap:** (//Coughs.//) hurry...

(//Gauss rifle fires and Belette Le Fou(ine) flies out of frame to dodge it. CSR-03 grabs her own M4 and fires at the loosed weapon, shattering it. Later examination of its remains indicate that it did not contain any conventional firearm mechanisms.//)

**CSR-03:** Just need one more clean shot. I won&#39;t let you down Cap.

(//Metal banging. CSR-03 looks over her shoulder at something out of frame.//)

**CSR-07:** Civilians... (//Coughs.//) evac-ing...

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) lands 10 meters from the trailer. It removes an unknown substance from its coat pocket and applies it to its forearm. It visibly winces in pain, but then looks up and grins.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Oh, what&#39;s this now?

(//In the corner of the video frame, a black gray wolf (//Canis lupus//), a coyote (//Canis latrans//) wearing a backpack, and a white fallow deer doe (//Dama dama//) wearing a black sweater flee together into the forest.//)

**CSR-03:** I won&#39;t let you touch them, bastard!

(//Gauss rifle fires. Belette Le Fou(ine) stops smiling and rapidly gesticulates with one arm while its other hangs limp. It is pushed over 150 meters away before it leans over to dodge the round instead of neutralizing it. Two tree trunks explode into splinters and fall over along a line 30° to the road.//)

**CSR-03:** What the fuck?! Even with just one arm?!

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) screams and grabs his forearm. Another tree creaks and falls over. Belette Le Fou(ine) kneels down in pain.//)

**CSR-03:** Now&#39;s my chance!

(//Trailer&#39;s internal lights do not come back on.//)

**CSR-03:** Shit, that&#39;s it for the Gauss.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) stands back up and releases its grip on its forearm.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** It appears that you can&#39;t use your fancy toy anymore!

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) grins and cackles. CSR-03 grabs her M4.//)

**CSR-03:** And it looks like you can&#39;t use your right arm anymore!

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) rapidly levitates towards the trailer.//)

----

[Video feed ends from power loss. Audio only.]

(//Gunfire.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** (//Giggles.//) Disabling my arm is just a minor inconvenience.

**CSR-03:** Stand down and surrender!

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** And why, my dear, should I do that?

**CSR-03:** You&#39;re injured, and I can guarantee that Foundation reinforcements are already on their way to investigate our signal loss.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** I still have a job to do, and I can guarantee that I&#39;ll finish it before that.

(//Gunfire.//)

**CSR-03:** You won&#39;t win. We&#39;ll bring the hammer down on you for what you&#39;ve done.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Knowing you Jailers, those &#39;reinforcements&#39; will be lackluster at best.

(//Gunfire. Clicking. CSR-03 laughs nervously.//)

**CSR-03:** You won&#39;t be able to get to them in time. They&#39;re so deep in those woods by now you&#39;ll never find them before we find you.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Tch. Tch. Tch. Oh, my dear, you don&#39;t understand. They&#39;ve already doomed themselves.

(//Blows landing. Exertion noises.//)

**CSR-03:** And why the fuck is that?!

(//Belette Le Fou(ine)&#39;s whispers in CSR-03&#39;s comm mic.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** (//Whispering://) Because, my dear, //those are my woods//.

(//CSR-03 screams. Squelching. CSR-03 gurgles.//)

**Ace:** Everyone alive?! Anyone hurt?

[[div class=&#34;aceNotes&#34;]]
Trapped between a wall and two...

Tree trunks? roots?

Wall airbags worked.

Nothing broken.

Not gutted. Not bleeding.

Guard trapped next to me.

Bleeding badly.
[[/div]]

**Bard:** Oi, that was rough! Not too knackered, but I smashed against the scale and got some cuts.

**Sandy:** I&#39;m okay. Lucky I was leaning against the front wall. Did we hit a roadside bomb?!

**Ace:** My theory: These roots slowed and stopped us, then grew through the floor. We all got thrown forward, but you guys slid back. The guard and I slid into the corner, and roots grew around us.

**Eve:** No... no no no no...

**Ace:** Eve, are you hurt? How bad is it?

**Eve:** I collided... with the samples. My leg&#39;s bleeding. I feel... feverish.

**Ace:** Shit! Bite down on something! Bard, get the shards out before it starts.

**Bard:** Right! Hold still Eve.

[[div class=&#34;aceNotes&#34;]]
Bard tears off sleeve. Tears in half.

Eve folds one half. Bites down on it.

**Eve:** (//Muffled groaning.//)

**Bard:** Got &#39;em out! Now brace yourself for the changes.

[[div class=&#34;aceNotes&#34;]]
Bard wraps wound with other half.

Eve nods. Eyes glassy. 

Closes eyes. Changes start.
[[/div]]

**Eve:** (//Muffled screaming.//)

**Sandy:** Jesus, is it really that painful? Glad I don&#39;t remember changing. Anything I can do to help?

**Ace:** Nothing you can really do for Eve, but you can try to pull me out of here.

...

**Ace:** Dammit, wait, stop-stop-//stop//! I&#39;m up against a sharp edge. It&#39;s tearing my clothes. Any further and it&#39;ll cut me.

**Sandy:** Shit! Sorry.

**Ace:** It&#39;s okay... Where&#39;s the rattlesnake?

**Bard:** Ace, you&#39;re not thinking what I think you&#39;re thinking, are you?

**Ace:** Depends on the status of that rare SCP-6090-A instance, and what&#39;s going on outside.

**Bard:** Ace, we&#39;ve talked about this before. I know what you&#39;re thinking.

**Sandy:** Found its carrier, but it&#39;s broken. Snake&#39;s not moving. Damn, it&#39;s bleeding.

**Ace:** Dammit. I figured as much, or it&#39;d be rattling like crazy by now.

[[div class=&#34;aceNotes&#34;]]
Eve&#39;s a white fallow deer therian now.
[[/div]]

(//Eve breathes loudly and raggedly.//)

**Ace:** It would be a shame to lose such a unique specimen. Its blood will only be viable for one more day now.

**Bard:** Ace, this is different from dressing up and playing around for a few days. It will be permanent.

**Eve:** Permanent...

[[div class=&#34;aceNotes&#34;]]
Eve feels her new doe head.

**Ace:** I know that, but unless the guards packed the Jaws of Life, it might be my only out too.

Guard looks through trailer&#39;s hole.

Two more guards run past outside.

One has Minigun. Bad sign?

**Bard:** Speak of the devil.

**CSR-08:** Got visual on the Civilians. Shit, Dr. A&#39;s infected! She&#39;s a fucking deer now.

(//Indistinct radio chatter.//)

**CSR-08:** They all look alive. No severe injuries, but Dr. R is trapped. You injured, Doc?

**Ace:** I&#39;m stuck, but okay. Got lucky. Couple more centimeters and I might have been gutted.

**CSR-08:** Try not to move then, and for fuck&#39;s sake, put your phone down.

**Ace:** But I&#39;m taking notes on this incident.

(//CSR-08 sighs.//)

[[div class=&#34;aceNotes&#34;]]
He doesn&#39;t know how important my notes will be.
[[/div]]

**Ace:** Did you guys pack the Jaws of Life?

**CSR-08:** If we did, it&#39;s inside a battery fire now.

[[div class=&#34;aceNotes&#34;]]
Maybe it&#39;s finally meant to be.

**CSR-08:** Seven&#39;s trapped worse than Dr. A, and he&#39;s injured. Seven, you alive? Wake the fuck up!

(//Loud slapping.//)

**CSR-07:** (//Coughs.//) Reporting. I&#39;m awake.

**CSR-Cap:** (//Radio.//) Can you access his wounds?

**CSR-08:** Nope, stuck under one of these roots. Might be what&#39;s keeping him from bleeding out.

**CSR-07:** I&#39;m really stuck. Can&#39;t get out, but I can at least move my other arm and point my gun.

**CSR-Cap:** (//Radio.//) Roger that. Protect the civilians if hostiles start showing.

**CSR-07:** I will until my last breath. (//Coughs.//)

[[div class=&#34;aceNotes&#34;]]
Trapped guard coughs up blood.
[[/div]]

**Sandy:** That last breath will probably be sooner than you think.

**CSR-01:** (//Radio.//) Got visual on Five and Six, and it&#39;s a SNAFU. Six is definitely dead. Five is unresponsive and underneath a dead steer.

[[div class=&#34;aceNotes&#34;]]
Guard silences radio.
[[/div]]

**CSR-08:** Everyone, just sit tight. If there&#39;s anything out there, we will protect you from it until reinforcements arrive.

**Ace:** You sure? It sounds like you&#39;re already down two men from the crash.

**CSR-08:** We will do everything we can with what we have left, down to the last man.

[[div class=&#34;aceNotes&#34;]]
Guard puts finger to ear.

Eyes wide. Turns pale.
[[/div]]

**CSR-08:** Shit! Just sit tight everyone! Don&#39;t leave the trailer!

Guard readies gun. Rushes back outside.

**CSR-08:** Confirmed! Hostile entity 50+ meters from trailer&#39;s six, floating 20+ meters off the ground.

**Eve:** It&#39;s more likely to be Keter Class.

**Ace:** Yeah, I concur there.

**Sandy:** The fuck&#39;s a //kinetohazard//?

**Ace:** No time to explain, but that&#39;s how it&#39;s bulletproof.

Gaping chest wound.

Something growing from it.

Vines? Thorny brambles.

Growing out mouth now. Nose. Ears. Eyes.

Covering whole body.

**Sandy:** Oh God, what the fuck?!

**Bard:** Seen a lot of nature anomalies, but that&#39;s right nasty.

**Eve:** Fascinating.

(//Outside: Shouting. Minigun firing intensifies.//)

**Ace:** Well, the Minigun obviously isn&#39;t Neutralizing it.

**Sandy:** (//Whines.//) So we really are screwed then?

**Ace:** Yeah, getting closer to agreeing with you on that point.

(//Outside: Cackling. 2 gunshots. Expletive. 4 gunshots. Metal clattering. Minigun firing stops.//)

**Ace:** I think I agree with you now, Sandy.

**Eve:** I can&#39;t believe I could die here... looking like this.

(//Outside: 2 gunshots. Body thudding.//)

**Sandy:** (//Whines.//) We really are about to die, aren&#39;t we?

**Bard:** (//Whimpers.//) I really hope not.

(//Outside: Shouting. Loud whirring.//)

[[div class=&#34;aceNotes&#34;]]
Lights flickering. Now off. 

Red emergency lights on.
[[/div]]

**Sandy:** What&#39;s happening now?

**Ace:** That would be the .80 Cal Gauss Rifle. Uses electricity instead of gunpowder.

**Sandy:** .80 Cal?! That&#39;s almost a cannon.

(//Outside: Shouting. Gauss Rifle fires. Metal sliding. Thud.//)

[[div class=&#34;aceNotes&#34;]]
Lights back on.
[[/div]]

**Ace:** Heh, almost as big as one too. Thought the Guard Captain was a psycho for bringing that on a mission like this, but now... (//Chuckles.//) Thank Gods he did.

**Sandy:** So we might have a chance?!

(//Outside: Gunfire. Distant yelp.//)

**Ace:** Well, judging by that cry of pain, perhaps we do.

(//Outside: 6 gunshots. Body rolling and thudding.//)

**Ace:** Hmmm... nope, I think we&#39;re screwed now.

**Sandy:** (//Whimpers.//) Oh my God.

(//Outside: Shouting. Loud whirring.//)

**Sandy:** We need to run.

**Bard:** Run to where? (//Whines.//) If we leave, whatever&#39;s out there will see and kill us.

(//Outside: Gunfire. 5 gunshots.//)

**Sandy:** Out into the forest! We&#39;re sitting ducks in here, but at least out there we can run and hide.

(//Outside: Shouting. Gauss rifle fires. Gunfire.//)

**Ace:** You three can also blend in as animals. As for me and &#39;Seven&#39; over here...

**CSR-07:** (//Coughs.//) It&#39;s a shame I can&#39;t reach it.

**Bard:** Reach what now?

**CSR-07:** My Lewis &amp; Clark Compass. Anomalous teleportation object. For emergency evac.

**Sandy:** Where is it? Maybe I can reach it.

**CSR-07:** Deep in my back pocket. Left cheek.

**Sandy:** Shit, his butt&#39;s completely blocked.

**CSR-07:** (//Chuckles. Coughs.//) Just as well, I&#39;m not sure if it can move more than one person.

(//Cackling outside.//)

**Ace:** Well, maybe I could reach it... if I become a rattlesnake.

**Bard:** Ace...

(//Loud whirring outside.//)

**Ace:** No, I&#39;m sure now. Never thought I&#39;d decide under duress, but at this point, I either live as a snake-man, or die here. You three need to get into the forest.

**Sandy:** Way ahead of you.

**Ace:** Bard, give me the rattlesnake carcass, and anything sharp.

[[div class=&#34;aceNotes&#34;]]
Sandy puts binoculars in backpack.

Bard reaches for dead snake and shard that killed it.
[[/div]]

**Sandy:** Okay, now, how do I transform again? I&#39;ve only done it once so far.

(//Outside: Gauss rifle fires. Loud cackling. Gunfire.//)

[[div class=&#34;aceNotes&#34;]]
Just made small incision on my arm.

Put dead snake on it.

Waiting for reaction.
[[/div]]

**Bard:** Imagine yourself as your animal. Imagine running through nature. Think wild thoughts. Whatever gets you there.

**Sandy:** Got it!

**Bard:** Don&#39;t forget to handle your clothes first.

**Sandy:** Yeah, yeah, I know.

(//Loud whirring outside.//)

**Ace:** Heh, good thing the lights just turned off.

[[div class=&#34;aceNotes&#34;]]
Spasm just went through my whole body.
[[/div]]

**Ace:** Bard, it&#39;s started. Roll up your shirt so I can bite on it.

**Bard:** Right, here you go. Eve, I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll need to get naked and transform too.

**Eve:** I beg your pardon! I am not disrobing in front of all of you.

(//Outside: Gauss rifle fires. Loud giggling. Gunfire.//)

[[div class=&#34;aceNotes&#34;]]
Lights not as bright.

Trailer battery getting low.

Sandy and Bard now in Feral Form.
[[/div]]

**Bard:** They&#39;ll make transforming difficult, and get ruined in the process.

**Eve:** I&#39;d like to keep some modicum of dignity. I&#39;ve lost enough already.

[[div class=&#34;aceNotes&#34;]]
Sandy slips into backpack.

Eve removes boots and lab coat.
[[/div]]

**Bard:** The sweater and the rest too, love.

**Eve:** No, this is as far as I go. The rest will either stretch to fit or slip off.

(//Loud whirring outside.//)

Eve stuffs dress-shorts into sweater.

**Bard:** If you say so. Now, you--

**Eve:** Yes, I already heard your instructions to Instance 4342.

**Bard:** (//Growls.//) Now isn&#39;t the time to call her th--

**Sandy:** Yes! I can still wear it!

**Bard:** Heh, be careful running though.

(//Gauss rifle fires outside.//)

[[div class=&#34;aceNotes&#34;]]
Eve now in Feral Form.

Sweater still intact, though stretched.
[[/div]]

**Ace:** Bard, I feel the fever, so it won&#39;t be long now. I&#39;ll go for the compass as soon as I can and flee.

[[div class=&#34;aceNotes&#34;]]
Spasms more frequent now.
[[/div]]

**Ace:** (//Grunts.//) Hopefully I won&#39;t end up in a part of the Louisiana Purchase or Oregon Territory with bad cell coverage. You three run and hide now. Good luck!

(//Outside: Loud whirring. Gunfire. 3 gunshots. Screaming.//)

**Bard:** Good luck to you too, mate!

**Sandy:** Let&#39;s go already!

[[div class=&#34;aceNotes&#34;]]
Bard exits through trailer hole. 

Sandy follows. Eve is halfway through.

(//Outside: Gauss rifle fires. Gunfire.//)

**Eve:** Dammit, come on! I can&#39;t be that large.

(//Hooves slipping and scraping. Metal banging.//)

**CSR-07: Civilians... (//Coughs.//) evac-ing...

Vision blurring. It&#39;s starting.

Going to stop. Bite. Shirt.
[[/div]]

(//Loud whirring outside.//)

**Ace:** (//Muffled screaming.//)

(//Outside: Gauss rifle fires. Distant trees falling.//)

**Ace:** (//Heavy panting.//) I&#39;m back! I feel different. I can feel my tail now.

(//Outside: Distant screaming and tree falling.//)

**Ace:** I&#39;ll take notes out loud since I&#39;m alone now.

(//CSR-07 coughs.//)

**Ace:** Mostly alone now. My head&#39;s scaly and snake shaped. Wow, my neck&#39;s long!

**Ace:** The lights are still off, so the trailer&#39;s battery is definitely dead, but the hostile entity outside probably isn&#39;t. Not good.

(//Tail rattling.//)

**Ace:** Damn, I can&#39;t stop my rattling. Seems to be involuntarily. Possibly stress related?

(//Rattling is disrupted between loud bumps and bangs.//)

**Ace:** I&#39;ve got 30 seconds to learn how to use this brand new, noisy appendage. Concentrate...

(//More bumps and bangs. Rattling gets louder.//)

**Ace:** Yes! I slipped it out in front of me without cutting it. Yeah, that&#39;s a Rattlesnake rattle alright.

(//Gunfire outside.//)

**Ace:** I&#39;m going to strap my phone to my tail as far from the rattle as I can get. Luckily, my phone&#39;s case has an adjustable wrist strap and a magnetic stylus. Hopefully I won&#39;t lose either while slithering.

(//Outside: Gunfire. Clicking. Nervous laughter.//)

**Ace:** (//Whispering.//) Now it&#39;s time for another crash course: Transforming. Gotta think like a rattlesnake. Imagine slithering in sand. Concentrate...

(//Outside: Screaming. Gurgling.//)

**Ace:** Yes! Achievement Unlocked! Feral Form!

(//Ace gasps.//)

[[div class=&#34;aceNotes&#34;]]
Stay quiet!

Typing with stylus in mouth now.

Tail useless for typing.

Felt limbs receding into body.

Still can&#39;t stop rattling.

Only red emergency lights.

Also lurid glow outside.

Battery fire must be intense by now.

Can feel it on my --skin-- scales from here.

Now to try to get that compass.

Something in front of trailer hole!

Humanoid entity. Standing pose. 

Floating almost upside down. 

135° angle from ground.

Clothes defying gravity. As if upright.

Now facing me! Smiling. Weasel head.

The hostile entity!
[[/div]]

**Ace:** (//Whispering.//) Switching back to audio notes. It&#39;s just... floating there... staring at me... //menacingly//.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Greetings, lad!

**Ace:** (//Gasps.//) C-care to talk to me upright?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Certainly.

**Ace:** (//Whispering.//) Rotating around in invisible axis centered on his belt, like he&#39;s on a carnival ride.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) grunts in pain.//)

**Ace:** (//Whispering.//) He&#39;s wounded though. There&#39;s a gash on his right thigh and a large, concave right forearm injury, probably down to the bone.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Allow me to introduce myself.

**Ace:** (//Whispering.//) He&#39;s cordially doffing his disco ball bowler hat and bowing. His clothes are torn around the wounds.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** I am Belette Le Fou(ine).

**Ace:** (//Whispering.//) There&#39;s something over them. Living seaweed? It&#39;s throbbing with his heartbeat.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** My, my, what a diligent researcher you are. Still taking notes, //even in the face of death//.

**Ace:** Well, hopefully my notes will survive, even if I don&#39;t.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** I wouldn&#39;t count on that.

**Ace:** At least you&#39;re upright now.

(//Gunfire.//)

**Ace:** So you are using kinetohazards then.

(//Bullets clinking as they hit the ground.//)

**CSR-07:** (//Coughs.//) You&#39;ll have to kill me first.

**Ace:** You&#39;re badly wounded. Wouldn&#39;t it behoove you to retreat before reinforcements arrive?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Merely flesh wounds. Not enough to stop me.

**CSR-07:** Come a little closer (//Coughs.//) and I&#39;ll give you some more &#39;flesh wounds.&#39;

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Oh, how amusing. Feel free to try. As for those &#39;reinforcements,&#39; I don&#39;t really care. Your friend already warned me about them, mere moments ago, //before I killed her//. Though I have to admit, I wasn&#39;t expecting that fancy toy she used.

(//Gunfire.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** (//Giggles.//) This, on the other hand, was thoroughly expected, easily countered, and greatly enjoyed.

(//Clinking.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Go on, empty your entire magazine. It won&#39;t do you any good, unless you decide put one in your head before I decide you no longer amuse me. It would likely be a more pleasant death for you.

**Ace:** What&#39;s your end goal here? Get your rocks off slaughtering a low security Foundation convoy?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** (//Chuckles.//) Oh, I&#39;m so glad you asked. The answer isn&#39;t nearly as crude, though I do thoroughly enjoy killing you Jailers. It&#39;s been so very long since I&#39;ve had the opportunity, and great pleasure, to do this.

**Ace:** Are you going to tell me, or just keep playing coy?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Very well. My associates and I wish to compare notes with you Jailers. See what you&#39;ve discovered, assess its worth, and then destroy all of you findings, so that only we possess the data. And have a little fun along the way, naturally.

**Ace:** Who are your associates, and what &#39;notes&#39; did you plan on &#39;comparing&#39; with us?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** (//Giggles.//) Nuh, uh, uh. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m going to have to keep playing coy there, though you can probably guess the latter answer.

**Ace:** And when you&#39;re done &#39;comparing notes&#39; with me?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Must I repeat myself? Destroy your copy of the data, of course, //including yourself//.

(//Gunfire. Clicking.//)

**CSR-07:** Ru- Slither away! (//Coughs.//) NOW! (//Coughs raggedly.//)

(//Rattling fades away.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** I admit, that is rather clever. Aiming for my head to block my vision with my own kinetic runes.

(//Clinking.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** One of your friends did the same, but it didn&#39;t do her any good, and it hasn&#39;t done you any good either.

**CSR-07:** (//Coughs.//) It let him get away, didn&#39;t it?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Yet another minor inconvenience. He&#39;ll be easy enough to track from just his rattle alone, let alone the fact that he&#39;s slithering right into //my forest//. Oh, what fun this will be!

(//CSR-07 coughs between words.//)

**CSR-07:** You won&#39;t win. Kill everyone on this mission, and the Foundation will send more. We will find you, and we will contain you... or neutralize you.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Hmmm, now that you&#39;re out of ammunition, you no longer amuse me. It&#39;s a shame you didn&#39;t save a single bullet for yourself.

(//CSR-07 coughing. Squelching. CSR-07 gurgling.//)

Sixth sense, both figuratively and literally.

Luckily, not some Predator Vision synesthesia.

No heat blobs in my vision.

No idea how to describe it.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** As diligent as ever, I see.

(//Whooshing. Bumping.//)

**Ace:** S-so, you&#39;re just going to invite yourself inside then?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Of course! This is my tree, after all.

**Ace:** You&#39;ve shrunken your hat and upper tux to fit your Feral Form.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Naturally. I always maintain my dignity, no matter what form I take.

**Ace:** Between your lack of pants and your weirdly twisted ferret torso, you look more cartoonish than dignified.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** (//Giggles.//) I suppose that&#39;s true.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) winces in pain.//)

**Ace:** Your forearm really does look bad. At least your bandages shrunk too.

**Ace:** Hey, stop looking over my shoul.. where my shoulder would be!

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Tch. Tch. Tch. I would appreciate if you used my actual Name in your notes about me: Belette Le Fou(ine).

[[div class=&#34;aceNotes&#34;]]
Belette Le Fou(ine).

Belette Le Fou(ine).
[[/div]]

**Ace:** Why do I keep typing it like that? It&#39;s like I can&#39;t fight the urge to add those parentheses.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Mmmm, it&#39;s because my Name is a Nomenclative Paradox.

**Ace:** Nomenclative... Paradox?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** I can see that Nomenclative Hazards aren&#39;t your forte. Then again, few Jailers are familiar with my people.

**Ace:** Your... people?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Why, the people of [[[SCP-4000|that wretched prison of trees]]], of course.

**Ace:** I... don&#39;t follow.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** (//Giggles.//) You really are simple, aren&#39;t you? It&#39;s better that you don&#39;t. It makes things more fun.

**Ace:** Uh...

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Well, to put it simply, my Name is both two names and no name at the same time.

**Ace:** ... Okay.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** I can see that you&#39;re confused, so let&#39;s move on.

**Ace:** Yes, let&#39;s do that. So, you wanted to compare notes with us. I&#39;m guessing either about [[[SCP-3577]]] or SCP-6090, right?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Ha! Maybe you aren&#39;t as simple as I thought. (//Winces.//) Yes, Trickster Magic is interesting, but not nearly as interesting as Therianthropy.

**Ace:** So you want to review our findings on SCP-6090? I&#39;m afraid to say we really only know the basics, just like the rest of the world behind the Veil.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Are you sure you didn&#39;t learn anything more? I find it hard to believe you Jailers would even take an interest in a mission like this otherwise.

**Ace:** Honestly, we were more concerned about a possible SCP-3577 outbreak, and any possible connections to a [[[SCP-1730|rather unfortunate incident]]]. We&#39;re still cleaning up its aftermath.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** And you Jailers honestly weren&#39;t worried the Therianthropy Virus would exacerbate either of those dilemmas?

**Ace:** Of course we were! That&#39;s why we were transporting every SCP-6090-A instance we could find back up to Boring.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** (//Winces.//) Yes, along with that were-coyote girl. A rather coincidental source species, wouldn&#39;t you agree?

**Ace:** We intended to save the U.I.U. some trouble and relocate her to Three Portlands under the conditions of the F.A.C.T.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Of course you were. I&#39;ll bet you Jailers hate that you have to set Therianthropes free.

**Ace:** So it&#39;s her you&#39;re after then?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Oh, don&#39;t sell yourself short! You&#39;re also quite the interesting Therianthrope. All of you are!

**Ace:** Is that why you&#39;re really doing this? To experiment on all of us?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Why not? (//Winces.//) After all, you&#39;ve all entered my personal petri dish.

**Ace:** So you&#39;re part of this anomalous forest then?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** (//Giggles.//) Maybe. Would it even matter? You&#39;re at my mercy either way.

**Ace:** I don&#39;t know what you stand to gain, and it looks like your injuries are getting worse.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Again, a minor inconvenience. Any iron in my system will be purged eventually.

**Ace:** Iron? As in the bullet shrapnel?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** You really aren&#39;t familiar with my people, are you? Oh, this is delightful! (//Winces.//)

**Ace:** Since you&#39;re going to keep playing coy about &#39;your people,&#39; why don&#39;t you tell me what you know about SCP-6090? After all, &#39;comparing notes&#39; goes both ways. Would you happen to know of its origins or a cure?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** (//Giggles.//) Not even my people know of a cure, but we do have our own theories. It is rather amusing you should ask of its origins, though.

**Ace:** I take it &#39;your people&#39; know more about its origins than we do? Did &#39;your people&#39; create it?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Oh ho ho! Perhaps I really was wrong in calling you a simpleton.

**Ace:** I&#39;ll take that as a yes.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Viruses are such fascinating little organic machines. You humans have only been toying with them for 130 years. My people have been doing it for much, //much// longer, all the way back to our Queen.

**Ace:** Your Queen?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** I fear I may have already said too much. I do tend to get carried away with these scintillating conversations.

**SCP-6090-B-4342:** So how long do we keep running?

**Dr. Dalton:** As long as we can, as fast as can. We need to get as far from both that fire and that //thing// as we can.

**SCP-6090-B-4342:** What&#39;s weird is the battery fire didn&#39;t look like it was spreading, and it was freaking intense.

(//Sounds of running fade.//)

**Dr. Dalton:** (//Distantly.//) Hey Eve! Why&#39;d you stop?!

**Dr. Antleur:** We&#39;re running in circles!

(//Footsteps approaching.//)

**Dr. Antleur:** And please address me as Dr. Antleur.

**Dr. Dalton:** Eve, now&#39;s not the time. It&#39;d be better if you just call me Bard and her Sandy.

**Evelynn:** (//Sighs.//) Very well. I suppose this situation does call for shorthand.

**Bardolph:** Now, what do mean? I&#39;ve been following the stars to run straight.

**Evelynn:** This boulder is rather distinct. I&#39;ve noticed it thrice now. That can&#39;t be a coincidence.

**Bardolph:** A rock&#39;s a rock. We need to keep moving.

**Evelynn:** I believe we might be in an anomalous forest.

**Sandra:** I&#39;m actually with Eve on this one. If we run to exhaustion, and that //thing// still finds us, what then?

**Bardolph:** That //thing// will catch up to us if we stop.

(//Fabric rustling.//)

**Sandra:** Woah, you had your phone in your sweater pocket?

**Evelynn:** Of course! ... How am I even able to hold it?

**Bardolph:** Your foreleg shape-shifted. That&#39;ll happen automatically, whenever you do human stuff in Feral Form.

**Sandra:** Cool!

**Evelynn:** Fascinating. I did reach for it before I remembered that I&#39;m... this now.

(//Tapping.//)

**Evelynn:** It seems my other foreleg shifted to use my phone. My hooves and dew claws have formed into a hand-like appendage.

**Bardolph:** Please, Eve, can we get going?

**Evelynn:** Just as I suspected, the ambient Hume level is below baseline, so this forest is indeed anomalous.

**Sandra:** In English?

**Evelynn:** This forest is &#39;weirder&#39; than it should be.

**Sandra:** And your phone can measure the weirdness level?

**Evelynn:** Yes.

(//Fabric rustling.//)

**Bardolph:** Okay, now can we get going?

(//Loud thudding.//)

**Bardolph:** What are you doing bucking that tree?!

**Evelynn:** I&#39;m making a distinct mark for an experiment.

**Bardolph:** Yeah, but isn&#39;t that overkill?!

**Sandra:** Heh, you trying to harvest invisible apples?

(//Thudding stops.//)

**Evelynn:** I&#39;m simply channeling my energy into something productive, as a coping mechanism.

**Sandra:** (//Whimpers.//) Oh... yeah...

**Bardolph:** Eve, I&#39;m right sorry this happened to you, but it&#39;d be better if you channeled that energy into running instead.

**Evelynn:** 43... Sandra, I need to you to use your binoculars as an optical rangefinder, to gauge the distance between marks I make. We&#39;ll soon know if this forest is repeating itself.

**Sandra:** Heh, I&#39;ll take Sandra. Still better than a number.

**Bardolph:** And what do I do?

**Evelynn:** Stand guard.

**Sandra:** Wow, you&#39;re right Bard. My paws changed without me thinking. My dew claws are like thumbs now.

**Bardolph:** It&#39;s weird at first, but you&#39;ll get used to it.

**Sandra:** And I really do have better night vision. How long will we do this?

**Evelynn:** Until my theory is verified, or until we lose the lodestars[[footnote]]Navigational Stars.[[/footnote]].

**Bardolph:** You do realize we won&#39;t be able to navigate again for hours? For the record, that&#39;s when I was planning a rest stop.

**Evelynn:** If my theory is correct, our ability to navigate won&#39;t matter.

**&lt;Continue Log, 2021-06-03 04:36 PST&gt;**

**Bardolph:** Stars are almost gone. Hope you&#39;re proud of slowing us down //and// leaving a trail.

**Sandra:** There&#39;s no way. (//Whines.//)

**Bardolph:** Well I&#39;ll be damned.

**Evelynn:** We may all be literally damned now. Unfortunately, my theory is correct.

(//Loud thudding.//)

**Bardolph:** Eve, I know it&#39;s upsetting, but please stop.

**Sandra:** That&#39;s the first mark! We really are running in circles!

(//Thudding intensifies.//)

**Bardolph:** Seriously, Eve! There&#39;s no point in the marks anymore!

(//Thudding stops.//)

**Evelynn:** Apologies. I just needed a moment. Sandra, what range do you have?

(//Sandra whines.//)

**Evelynn:** Sandra Collins! Instance 4342!

**Sandra:** Roughly 150 meters.

**Evelynn:** Summed up, that marks approximately 1650 meters before repetition occurs.

**Bardolph:** So, what exactly does that mean?

**Evelynn:** It means that the forest is indeed Non-Euclidean. I doubt we&#39;ll be able to access the road we came from. This forest is also very likely connected to the entity that ambushed our convoy.

**Sandra:** So... we&#39;re trapped? At the mercy of that... thing? That thing even a fucking //Gauss Rifle// couldn&#39;t put down?!

**Evelynn:** That is a possibility, and this wouldn&#39;t be the first documented case of malicious entities trapping people.

(//Sandra whines loudly.//)

**Bardolph:** (//Whimpers.//) So, what now? Maybe it only repeats in that direction.

**Evelynn:** That&#39;s also a possibility. We should probably repeat the experiment at a 90° angle, once we&#39;ve regained the ability to navigate. For now, we need to find a secluded area to rest and plan.

**Sandra:** How... long... ?

**Evelynn:** Impossible to say. There are cases of entities trapping victims for what they perceived to be millions of years.

(//Sandra howls.//)

**Evelynn:** Sandra, you need to learn to //stifle yourself//!

(//Sandra whines and sobs.//)

**Bardolph:** Eve, //you// need to learn to //read the room//!

**Evelynn:** I am merely making statements based on our observations and similar cases. She asked questions, and I answered them.

**Bardolph:** Yeah, but you don&#39;t lead with the worst case!

**Evelynn:** Would you rather I withheld vital information?

**Bardolph:** I&#39;d rather you stay quiet for now.

**Sandra:** It&#39;s not fair!

**Evelynn:** Sandra, stifle your...

(//Bardolph growls.//)

**Bardolph:** There now, love, we&#39;ll get through this together.

**Sandra:** But that thing said it wants to kill us!

**Bardolph:** It might have just meant the Guards.

**Sandra:** So what, then? Does it want to torture us?

**Bardolph:** I couldn&#39;t tell you, but what I can tell you is that you&#39;ve got us to face it with you. I&#39;ll do everything I can to make sure it doesn&#39;t hurt you.

**Sandra:** I didn&#39;t ask for any this.

**Bardolph:** None of us did, love.

**Sandra:** No, not just this bullshit. This new face. These freaky new powers. I just want to go home, back to my old life, friends and family, but I know even that&#39;s not an option now.

**Bardolph:** I told you, there are plenty of options out there for you, and you&#39;re always welcome in Boring.

**Sandra:** Yeah, and what about everything I&#39;m leaving behind? (//Whimpers.//) When the pandemic happened, I just kept telling myself to wait it out. That eventually, I&#39;d get to hang out with my friends again. That the places where we used to hang out would be fully open again. And no more mask bullshit! But now... Now that will never happen, and I&#39;m stuck wearing a different kind of mask, one that I can never remove to see my old face again!

**Bardolph:** You still have pictures of yourself prior to infection, don&#39;t you? Surely you took some selfies, right?

**Sandra:** It&#39;s not the same! Just another cruel reminder of what I can //never have again//!

**Evelynn:** This is a waste of time and will likely draw attention to us!

**Sandra:** You really are an ice cold bitch, you know that.

**Evelynn:** I&#39;m being practical, and technically, since you are a female canine, you are the actual //bitch// here.

**Bardolph:** Okay, both of you are getting way out of line!

**Evelynn:** No, she&#39;s the only one out of line by not focusing on our current situation. We need to escape this forest, and then cope with what we&#39;ve become.

**Sandra:** Yeah... cope... That&#39;s easy for you to say. You were already living and working in weird world before this happened to you. You get to keep your job and your friends and everything else that matters to you. They&#39;ll all just shrug off your new look.

**Evelynn:** Hmph. For your information, I may work behind the Veil, but I still had a life outside it. There are also venues I was looking forward to visiting again and people I wanted to see again. I will have to cut ties with all of that now.

**Sandra:** Well, at least you still have your career. I&#39;m not sure what career I&#39;ll be able to make for myself now, if any. As if that wasn&#39;t already hard enough to do &#39;outside the Veil,&#39; before all this happened.

**Evelynn:** True, but now it will likely become much more difficult to advance my career. I may never become a Site Director now.

**Sandra:** I&#39;m so sorry you won&#39;t get to climb that corporate ladder. Must be nice.

**Evelynn:** And despite what you might think, not everyone I know will simply &#39;shrug off&#39; my condition. Even my coworkers and supervisors. They&#39;ll never see me the same way again, both figuratively and literally. (//Voice breaking.//) I doubt he&#39;ll ever love me looking like this. I doubt anyone ever well.

**Sandra:** Huh, I hadn&#39;t even considered romance. Of course, that was always the last thing on my mind, even before all of this. My ex can go fuck himself with a kitchen knife. At least he&#39;ll also never get to see my old face again, and this makes ghosting him so much easier. One of the few good things to come out of it.

**Bardolph:** Hey now, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find love again. Both of you will!

**Sandra:** Oh, please! There&#39;s only one group of people that would find us attractive now.

**Evelynn:** Please refrain from bringing up //those// people. I&#39;d rather not think about //those// prospects yet.

**Bardolph:** Hey! Not all of us... them are bad! Some would just be happier as animals. I&#39;m certainly happier in my Feral Form than in my Base Form.

**Sandra:** (//Gasps.//) Oh my God, you&#39;re one of them, aren&#39;t you?!

(//Sandra laughs.//)

**Sandra:** I&#39;d know that bashful expression on any dog. You really are! This is hilarious! I&#39;ll bet you find me attractive, don&#39;t you?

**Bardolph:** Well... I... uhhh...

**Sandra:** (//Giggles.//) You know Wolves and Coyotes are capable of interbreeding, don&#39;t you, you dirty dog?

**Bardolph:** Well... yes... of course...

**Evelynn:** (//Clears throat.//) Could you please cease these vulgarities?! Romance is also the last thing I want to think about, especially right now.

**Sandra:** (//Sighs.//) Yeah, sorry. I just //really// needed a moment to take my mind off the fact that we&#39;re trapped in a magical forest of death.

**Bardolph:** Heh, I&#39;m just glad you&#39;re feeling better, love, even if it&#39;s at my expense.

**Evelynn:** Then I&#39;d suggest we first concentrate on escaping this place alive. Afterwards, we can focus on cutting all ties beyond the Veil.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** (//Giggles.//) Mmmm, yes, &#39;cutting all ties.&#39;

(//Sandra yips.//)

**Bardolph:** (//Whimpers.//) Oh... No!

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** It&#39;s astounding how willing you Jailers are to destroy even your own lives, on top of the countless lives of many others, for the sake of preserving &#39;normalcy.&#39;

**Sandra:** Holy shit, he really is a were-weasel, in a freaking tux!

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** I would have thought the previous year alone has taught all of you Jailers how drastically &#39;normalcy&#39; can be shifted, even by the most seemingly insignificant things, so it doesn&#39;t really matter in the end.

**Evelynn:** How long have you been up there?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Long enough to overhear most of this amusing argument amongst Jailers.

**Sandra:** Why are you calling us Jailers?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Oh, my apologies for the confusion. I am addressing them, my dear, not you. Terribly sorry.

**Sandra:** Okay, why do you keep calling //them// Jailers?

(//Air whooshing. Sandra yelps. Gravel crunching.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Because that&#39;s what they are, my dear.

**Bardolph:** Hey, get away from her! (//Growls.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Sure, the wolf there may not work for them, but he aids them enough that he might as well be one.

**Bardolph:** I said get away from her! (//Barks.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** But you, my dear, you aren&#39;t like them. You&#39;re something special, //very special//.

(//Bardolph growls louder.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Oh, I can tell! I have an eye for such things, and unfortunately, so do they. Let me guess, they plan on taking you back to their &#39;site&#39; to run some more &#39;tests&#39;?

**Sandra:** Y-yes, but they said once those were complete, I&#39;d be free to go.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** (//Cackles.//) Yes, I&#39;m sure that&#39;s what they told you, but I&#39;m also sure those &#39;tests&#39; will beget more &#39;tests,&#39; which will then beget more in turn, ad infinitum.

**Sandra:** Ad infinitum?

(//Air whooshing.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** As for me, I simply wish to compare notes with all of you, and have a little fun along the way.

**Evelynn:** And after you&#39;ve &#39;compared notes&#39; with us?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Then this will all be over, //and so will your lives//. I prefer not to drag things out with false hope like you Jailers do.

(//Sandra growls.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Tch. Tch. Tch. It seems you&#39;ve made quite a mess of things, though.

**Evelynn:** We&#39;ve determined that we&#39;re trapped in an area roughly 1.5 kilometers in length.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** (//Giggles.//) I could have told you that without all the effort, but it does explain some sensations.

**Evelynn:** So you are indeed the one who trapped us then, via a connection with this anomalous forest.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** (//Cackles.//) Very astute, my dear! Now, let&#39;s undo what you&#39;ve done. We can&#39;t have anymore cartography, now can we?

(//Wood groaning and creaking.//)

**Evelynn:** You can heal the trees? Just how much control do you have over this place?

(//Rocks clattering.//)

**Sandra:** Fuck you! You ain&#39;t torturing or killing me without a fight!

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Ow!

(//Wood creaking stops.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Stop!

**Sandra:** What the fuck?!

**Evelynn:** Kinetoglyphs.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** How uncouth! It&#39;s very rude to throw things, my dear.

(//Rocks falling to ground.//)

**Evelynn:** Ah, so Dr. Rateleken was correct. You can create defensive kinetohazards.

(//Air whooshing. Fabric fluttering. Grass crunching.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** (//Closely.//) Oh ho ho! Very astute indeed, my dear. Maybe you aren&#39;t as simple as he is.

**Bardolph:** (//Growls.//) What did you do to Ace?!

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Mmmm, wouldn&#39;t you like to know?

**Evelynn:** It used the present tense, so it likely hasn&#39;t killed him.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Wow! You may be too smart for your own good. I might just kill you right now.

**Bardolph:** (//Growls. Barks.//) You better no...

**Evelynn:** But then we wouldn&#39;t be able to &#39;compare notes&#39; first. Isn&#39;t that what you want?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** (//Cackles.//) Right you are, my dear! Still, I will kill you if you don&#39;t start using my name.

(//Rocks clattering.//)

**Sandra:** Hey! Cut her some slack! She isn&#39;t really good with name courtesy.

(//Rocks falling to ground, one by one.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Please stop throwing those rocks. //Don&#39;t make me repeat myself.//

(//Rocks pouring onto ground.//)

**Evelynn:** Nonsense, Sandra. Very well, Belette Le Fou(ine), what notes do you wish to compare?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** (//Giggles.//) Oh, I was hoping you&#39;d finally ask that! Why, the very reason you&#39;ve changed, of course.

**Evelynn:** Hmmm, so our findings on SCP-6090, the Therianthropy Virus, then?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Yes! So tell me, what do you know about it?

**Evelynn:** Unfortunately, little more than what the rest of the world within the Veil knows about it.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** And doesn&#39;t that bother you? Not only as a Jailer, but as someone who&#39;s now cursed with it as well?

**Evelynn:** I would hardly call this infection a curse...

**Sandra:** I sure would!

**Evelynn:** ...though it is interesting you&#39;d use that phrasing. Do you consider it a curse? Given your physiology, I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re infected as well.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** (//Cackles.//) So smart, and yet still so ignorant! You Jailers really are still in the //dark// as to its machinations, but isn&#39;t the //dark// where you all insist on //dying//, after all?

**Evelynn:** True, we still don&#39;t fully understand the mechanisms behind its effects, particularly in humans and the polymorphic abilities it gives to them. However, our latest findings indicate that there may very well be a powerful thaumaturgical or even reality bending element to it.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** (//Giggles.//) And I&#39;m guessing she&#39;s your &#39;latest findings,&#39; isn&#39;t she?

**Evelynn:** She is our most recent documented case of infection in humans, yes.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** I&#39;ll bet she&#39;s much more than that, isn&#39;t she?

**Sandra:** Yeah, I think I can change the past now, like that magical coyote that changed the past to bite me.

**Evelynn:** Sandra!

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Oh, what&#39;s with that motion, my dear? Has //she// said too much now, or did you simply want me to //lop off your head//?

(//Evelynn clears her throat.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Yes, I&#39;ll bet you hate having a deer head now, don&#39;t you? Would no head at all suit you better?

**Bardolph:** (//Growls.//) If you so much as try...

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** (//Cackles.//) You&#39;ll do what? I&#39;m genuinely curious what you&#39;d do if I were to kill her right in front of you, since you seem to be the least equipped of everyone here. //Shall we find out?//

(//Bardolph barks and growls. Sandra growls.//)

**Evelynn:** I-I&#39;ll settle for having a d-deer head. Now... w-what more did you want to discuss? I... I can go over more details of SCP-6090 with you.

(//Rocks clattering.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** What did I just warn you against earlier, my dear?

(//Rocks fall to ground. Evelynn starts hyperventilating.//)

**Sandra:** I don&#39;t care! You aren&#39;t killing her, or me, or Bard!

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Futile, but still amusing. It&#39;s also amusing you&#39;ve discarded decency and assumed your humanoid form to defend her.

**Sandra:** What the fuck are you...? Oh, God! When did I...?!

(//Sandra screams. Rocks pouring onto ground. Rapid footsteps and rustling.//)

**Sandra:** Stop oggling me, you perverted furries!

(//Air whooshing. Fabric rustling. Evelynn takes deep, ragged breaths.//)

**Bardolph:** I wasn&#39;t even looking at you!

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) cackles and guffaws. Its frequency changes from Doppler Effect. Later notes from Dr. Antleur indicate that Belette Le Fou(ine) was flying around wildly and flipping in a manner similar to a trapeze artist while laughing.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** You humans really are so wildly amusing! I can see why my people tried a similar experiment on a fateful summer night, so long ago.

(//Evelynn&#39;s breathing slows and calms.//)

**Evelynn:** A similar experiment?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Oops! Once again, I may have said a bit too much. (//Winces.//) Perhaps I&#39;ll go check on your friend now.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) cackles, which fades away. Evelynn loudly exhales and takes slow, shuddering breaths.//)

**Bardolph:** Thank God that&#39;s over!

**Sandra:** It&#39;s only over for now. Why didn&#39;t you fuckers tell me I changed?! I didn&#39;t even notice!

**Bardolph:** I swear to God, I didn&#39;t notice either! I was too focused on whether Belette Le Fou(ine) was about to kill Eve!

**Sandra:** What the fuck happened?! I thought only my paws would change to throw those rocks!

**Bardolph:** When you try to do something too human, like those cricket pitches you were doing, you can change back involuntarily. Happens quite often with new Therians.

**Sandra:** So you really were looking at me, you pervert?!

**Bardolph:** No, I&#39;m only guessing, I swear!

**Sandra:** Yeah, right! Just don&#39;t look at me now.

**Bardolph:** Okay! I&#39;ll... I&#39;ll go check on Eve.

(//Approaching footsteps.//)

**Bardolph:** Are you okay, Eve?

**Evelynn:** I... I just need a moment... to regain my composure.

**Bardolph:** Do you need a hug? I give great wolf hugs, or at least I&#39;ve been told as much.

**Evelynn:** No, thank you.

**Bardolph:** Whatever you need, I&#39;m here for you.

**Evelynn:** Honestly, this isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve been face-to-face with a malicious entity who feigned an intent to kill. You&#39;d think I&#39;d be used to it by now.

**Bardolph:** You put on a tough front. I can tell. My shoulder&#39;s here if you need to cry on it. Trust me, it really does help.

**Evelynn:** I appreciate the kind offer, but I&#39;m fine now. We all need to focus on when it eventually comes back.

**Bardolph:** Well, I&#39;ll still stay by your side for now.

**Evelynn:** Actually, I think I&#39;ll assume Base Form as well, and I&#39;d appreciate some privacy.

**Bardolph:** I&#39;ll be happy to give you some, and keep watch for anything hostile.

**Evelynn:** Thank you.

**Bardolph:** Lucky you ignored me, kept your sweater and packed your shorts.

**Evelynn:** I do hope Sandra did the same. I don&#39;t trust any plant material in this forest now.

(//Approaching footsteps.//)

**Sandra:** Yeah, I wasn&#39;t stupid enough to bring my backpack and not pack some of my clothes in it. Couldn&#39;t fit my shoes, though.

**Bardolph:** Heh, looks like I&#39;m the odd one out, then. Wish I&#39;d figured a way to bring at least my underwear.

**Sandra:** Or maybe you just like being naked, you pervert.

**Bardolph:** Could you please stop calling me that?!

**Sandra:** Well, I&#39;m not about to be a contestant on Naked and Afraid: Furry Edition. I brought my clothes //and// more than one item.

**Bardolph:** I&#39;ll just stay in my Feral Form, then. Honestly, I can probably do more to help in this form anyway.

**Evelynn:** So, just focus on my humanoid form and activities that only it can physically perform, correct?

**Bardolph:** Pretty much, yeah.

**Sandra:** You can transform and get dressed now, Eve. I&#39;ll make sure this pervert...

**Bardolph:** (//Yelps.//) Ow!

**Sandra:** ...doesn&#39;t look at you.

**Bardolph:** (//Whines.//) Stop pinching my ear!

**Sandra:** Yeah? Close your eyes and don&#39;t open them until I tell you, or I&#39;ll bite it next. Even in this form, I still have a muzzle full of yote teeth.

**Bardolph:** (//Whimpers.//) I wasn&#39;t going to look, but fine.

**Evelynn:** Actually, he said he was going to stand guard.

**Sandra:** Ugh, fine.

(//Bardolph loudly shakes his head.//)

**Sandra:** But I swear, if I see your head swivel more than an inch in our direction.

**Bardolph:** I keep telling you...(//Sighs.//) Maybe you&#39;ll take my word after seeing me keep it.

**Sandra:** Yeah, we&#39;ll see. I&#39;ll be keeping guard near here, so there should be //absolutely no reason// for you to look our way, unless you spot something.

**Bardolph:** Yep!

(//Footsteps fade.//)

**Evelynn:** I&#39;ve been thinking about what Belette Le Fou(ine) said. Despite the trauma, some things still stood out to me.

(//Rustling.//)

**Sandra:** Well, I&#39;ve been thinking about how I can kill that weasel before he kills me or you... Or even Bard, even though he&#39;s in the dog house right now.

**Evelynn:** That might not be wise. We don&#39;t know if that&#39;s even possible, or what would happen to this forest afterwards. If we did somehow neutralize it, the entire area could deconceptualize into unreality and take all of us with it.

(//Fabric rustling and rubbing.//)

**Sandra:** I don&#39;t know what any of that means, but I do know that he can be injured. The guards managed to get in a few lucky shots on his leg and arm. In fact, his arm wasn&#39;t moving, and its bandage looked huge and sunken.

**Evelynn:** I definitely took notice of that, and how the bandages appeared to be living seaweed.

**Sandra:** Anyway, we might not have what our guards had, but I did notice that weasel got too distracted to cast that kinetic crap when he was fixing up the damage to this little stage he&#39;s trying to play with us on.

**Evelynn:** Huh... It&#39;s funny that you should describe this forest as a stage. Belette Le Fou(ine) mentioned his &#39;people&#39; performed a &#39;similar experiment&#39; on a summer night a long time ago. I wonder if he was talking about a certain Midsummer Night.

**Sandra:** (//Laughs.//) Seriously?! That&#39;s quite a leap!

**Evelynn:** Welcome to the Foundation, where we&#39;ve already documented numerous possible connections between the anomalous and works of fiction from antiquity.

**Sandra:** But really, that play is over 500 years old, and its story takes place in Ancient Greece, thousands of years ago.

**Evelynn:** We have already contained many anomalies that are far older than that.

**Sandra:** So you&#39;re saying Bottom could have been a Therianthrope. A were-donkey?

**Evelynn:** It is a fascinating possibility, and it opens up the possibility that Belette Le Fou(ine) is a Faerie.

**Sandra:** So wait, even Faeries are real? God, this is all such a head trip. Even literally, since I have a new head! (//Chuckles.//) Just like Bottom.

**Evelynn:** Unfortunately, the Foundation has very limited knowledge of the Fae, and my knowledge is even more limited, since it&#39;s not my department. I was only obligated to learn about [[[SCP-4000|Protocol 4000-Eshu]]], which involves abstaining from using any names, titles, or designations when dealing with certain entities and anomalies.

**Sandra:** Again, seriously?! Names?! Well, in that case, we&#39;re already screwed, since we&#39;ve been using our own names quite a bit with that weasel around.

**Evelynn:** Yes, it is rather curious, but I believe the protocol is only observed in the presence of the Nameless, and that entity clearly has a Name, Belette Le Fou(ine), and insisted we use it.

**Sandra:** Well, I ain&#39;t giving him the pleasure. I saw the way he was looking at me, and he also didn&#39;t point out that I was naked until it was convenient for him. The way he was talking about me too...

(//Sandra loudly shudders.//)

**Sandra:** And I thought my ex was bad. Bard may be in the closet, but that guy is out and disgusting. ... Though I might have been wrong about Bard after all. Dude hasn&#39;t looked over here once, not even for a split second. He&#39;s just been staring at the sky.

**Evelynn:** Speaking of which, there&#39;s now adequate light that I can begin documenting our surroundings with my camera. Since we&#39;re all as decent as we can get, and I have proper hands again, I&#39;m going to end the audio log here and begin a video one.

(//Fabric rustling.//)

**Sandra:** Heh, well I&#39;m going to start making some spears to gut that fucker, and then carve some curse words into his precious trees. That should hopefully be a big enough distraction for an opening.

**Evelynn:** I still strongly advise against doing that. We should formulate a proper plan with Bardolph first.

**Sandra:** Pssh, fine, whatever.

(//Tapping.//)

**Evelynn:** Ending audio log...

**Ace:** I hope there&#39;s enough light to do this now. I&#39;m unsure how much my night vision has changed. I also hope my snout works so I don&#39;t have to use my stylus.

(//Video flip transitions to show the head of a// Crotalus atrox //with a human-esque brow and forward facing eyes staring into the camera.//)

**Ace:** Hey, it does! Excellent!

(//Distant forlorn howl. Ace looks off to the side.//)

**Ace:** That sounded like a coyote. I really hope it&#39;s who I think it is, and not a wild one.

(//Ace makes a quizzical expression and flicks his tongue.//)

**Ace:** Huh, is that what I look like? Not half bad, all things considered.

(//Ace opens his mouth wide, unfolding his fangs, and closes it again.//)

**Ace:** Very interesting.

(//Ace repeats the process twice more.//)

**Ace:** So that&#39;s how I&#39;m able to talk. Fascinating hybrid oral anatomy.

(//Ace shifts his head around, looking at it from all angles.//)

**Ace:** Okay, enough self-admiration. This is Dr. Atticus Rateleken, S.C.P. Foundation Researcher, Level 3. In case it isn&#39;t already obvious, I am now an SCP-6090-B instance, infection source species: //Crotalus atrox//, the Western Diamondback Rattlesnake. This video will serve as a continuation of Incident Log 6090-1.

(//Ace&#39;s snout moves towards the camera. Video flip transitions back to a view 10 centimeters above the forest floor. Camera angles upwards to show the surrounding trees in the pre-dawn light.//)

**Ace:** This is the forest in which I attempted to hide from the malicious entity that attacked the convoy, self-designation: Belette Le Fou(ine).

(//Camera swivels to show a tree with a small hole halfway up its trunk.//)

**Ace:** That is the tree in which I hid, though my efforts proved futile. At least I know Belette Le Fou(ine) doesn&#39;t intend to kill me right away.

(//Camera moves closer to the hollow tree.//)

**Ace:** I will attempt to visually verify and test the anomalous properties of this forest.

(//Camera points up towards the sky.//)

**Ace:** I am going to assume Base Form again to have hands again.

(//Leaves rustling. Camera swings around wildly as if on a very long self-picture monopod.//)

**Ace:** Success! I&#39;ll try not to get too much of myself in my shot.

(//Camera stops moving. View is now 2 meters off the ground, and flip transitions to show Ace&#39;s snake head and bare human shoulders.//)

**Ace:** Oh good, I got the shot right. If I can just hold my tail in that position, everything should be fine.

(//Ace runs both hands over his head and neck, which is a much larger version of his Feral Form head.//)

**Ace:** Wow, my neck is long! It&#39;s got to be around 40 centimeters now. My tail is almost 2 meters in length, so I can easily use it as a selfie stick.

(//Ace opens his mouth twice again, and wiggles his brows.//)

**Ace:** Yep, the expected Theriocephalic anatomy, a hybrid of human and rattlesnake. Anyway, back to the matter at hand.

(//Ace walks up to the tree and leans against the trunk.//)

**Ace:** Nothing seems out of the ordinary. Just a normal stress-induced tree hollow.

(//Camera shifts view. Tapping. Camera&#39;s flashlight activates. Camera is moved to look inside tree hollow.//)

**Ace:** Wait, is that writing?

(//Camera shows a message carved into the interior wooden wall: HOW MANY MORE?//)

**Ace:** &#39;How many more?&#39; Of what?

(//Camera shifts around to try to spot any other text. There is none.//)

**Ace:** I don&#39;t recall that text being there when I was inside the tree. Maybe Belette Le Fou(ine) wrote it while talking to me.

(//Camera pulls back from hollow. Tapping. Flashlight turns off.//)

**Ace:** I&#39;m going to see if this is actually a tree inside.

(//Ace ducks down out of frame. Rocks clattering.//)

**Ace:** Ah, here&#39;s a good one!

(//Ace reenters frame with a sharp rock and starts scraping away the bark.//)

**Ace:** Nope, nothing but ordinary wood, though I can&#39;t really analyze it.

(//Camera moves close to incision, showing innocuous bark and wood.//)

[[div class=&#34;kca&#34;]]
**K.C.Alert:** Hume at 0.76
[[/div]]

(//Silent push notifications start appearing at the top of the video frame.//)

**Ace:** Why would Belette Le Fou(ine) tell me this tree would bite? Why would I believe it?

[[div class=&#34;kca&#34;]]
**K.C.Alert:** Hume at 0.71
[[/div]]

(//Ace scrapes harder and faster, making exertion noises. Rattling starts.//)

**Ace:** That asshole was just messing with me! I can&#39;t hide from it. I can&#39;t run from it. I&#39;m its plaything now until it ends me!

[[div class=&#34;kca&#34;]]
**K.C.Alert:** Hume at 0.64

(//Rattling gets louder. Camera starts to vibrate slightly. Ace pants and drops the rock.//)

**Ace:** (//Sighs.//) What am I doing?

[[div class=&#34;kca&#34;]]
**K.C.Alert:** Hume at 0.53
[[/div]]

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** (//Giggles.//) Yes, what are you doing to one of //my// trees?

(//Ace hiss-yells. Camera turns to show Belette Le Fou(ine) standing next to another tree, back in Base Form.//)

**Ace:** Ssshit!

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** I did warn you, didn&#39;t I?

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) wiggles its fingers. Wood creaks and groans in the background. Camera turns back to the tree. The hollow hole snaps shut and disappears, as if it had never been there. Bark rapidly grows back over the incision.//)

**Ace:** Sorry you didn&#39;t get the chance to guillotine me.

(//Camera turns back to face Belette Le Fou(ine).//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Yes, it really is a shame that you actually heeded my warning.

**Ace:** How many more of what?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Oh, so you did see my message! Good. Yes, how many more of so many things.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) waves its hand and a giant toadstool starts growing out of the ground beside it.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** How many more lives will you Jailers ruin?

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) sits down on the toadstool and crosses its injured leg over its other one.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** How many more of my people would you ruin if you got the chance?

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) doffs its hat, places it on its knee, and lifts it to reveal a saucer and steaming hot cup of tea balanced on it.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** How many more experiments will we conduct before I //end your life//?

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) dons its hat again and takes a polite sip of its tea.//)

**Ace:** Why not just kill me right now? Why wait? It looks like your injuries are still getting worse, and you clearly can&#39;t use your right arm.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Because it&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve had the chance to kill Jailers. I intend to savor it for as long as I can, despite my injuries. Besides, we haven&#39;t finished comparing notes yet.

**Ace:** What more is there to compare? I&#39;ve already told you everything the Foundation knows about SCP-6090.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) takes another sip of its tea.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Mmmm, you do actually make a good point there, since you Jailers seem to be either tight-lipped or outright ignorant. If anything, I&#39;ve actually given you more information.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) sets the teacup back on the saucer and wiggles its fingers. Wood creaking.//)

[[div class=&#34;kca&#34;]]
**K.C.Alert:** Hume at 0.50
[[/div]]

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Not that it matters, since none of you are leaving this forest alive.

(//Camera turns towards the tree trunk Ace has been leaning on. Multiple branches rapidly sprout and wrap themselves around Ace&#39;s torso and legs. Ace starts yelling. Rattling intensifies. Video starts to blur from the vibration.//)

[[div class=&#34;kca&#34;]]
**K.C.Alert:** Hume at 0.48
[[/div]]

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Perhaps I should just kill you right here and now.

**Ace:** No! Please stop!

(//Saucer and teacup loudly clink from Belette Le Fou(ine) drinking its tea.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** And here I thought a moment ago you were asking me to kill you instead of waiting. Did I mishear you?

[[div class=&#34;kca&#34;]]
**K.C.Alert:** Hume at 0.44
[[/div]]

**Ace:** Please! I don&#39;t want to die!

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Very well then.

(//Wood creaking and groaning stops.//)

**K.C.Alert:** Hume at 0.52
[[/div]]

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** But first, make yourself decent. I grow weary of your nudity.

**Ace:** And how am I supposed to do that?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** How are you supposed to escape, you simpleton?

**Ace:** Right.

(//Camera moves in a way indicative of Ace&#39;s tail shrinking. Camera moves downward through a series of branches.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Now see, that wasn&#39;t so difficult.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) winces in pain.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Oh, how I detest having to be in two places at once. I should probably rectify this issue.

(//Camera is now 10 centimeters off the ground, and angles up to show Belette Le Fou(ine) finishing its tea.//)

**Ace:** So you&#39;re about to leave to antagonize my associates again?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Yes, as it seems my ears are burning from your friends being naughty again elsewhere in my forest.

**Ace:** Seems more like it&#39;s your wounds that are burning. You really are confident, aren&#39;t you?

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) giggles.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Always beware that I can kill them and you any time I please, with one arm almost literally tied behind my back, all while enjoying a nice cup of tea.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) doffs its hat and covers the teacup and saucer with it.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** I&#39;m also not the only one you should be mindful of while in this forest.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) lifts its hat to reveal the teacup and saucer have vanished, and dons it again.//)

**Ace:** So you aren&#39;t the only sapient hostile entity here?

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) winces.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Mmmm, no, I would say that I&#39;m probably the only one here with any real intelligence, though not the only hostile one.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) giggles.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Really, you seem to have forgotten all the implications of what you are now. You might be a predator, but you aren&#39;t an apex one.

**Ace:** What exactly do you me...

(//Ace screams. Camera wildly bounces around before facing the ground, which rapidly accelerates away as it ascends into the air.//)

(//Camera shifts to show Belette Le Fou(ine) flying alongside the owl. Belette Le Fou(ine)&#39;s normal speaking voice is somehow able to cut through the wind noise. Ace yells back.//)

**Ace:** This is your doing, isn&#39;t it?! You also control the fauna?!

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) cackles.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Does it even matter right now? How will you escape? Think, simpleton, think!

(//Camera swings around wildly. Ace cries out in pain.//)

**Ace:** I am not about to become an owl pellet!

(//Camera shows brief glimpses of two people and a black wolf in a clearing.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Mmmm, it seems this situation will rectify itself rather soon.

**Note**: Log created from Video Recording made by Dr. Evelynn Antleur.

**&lt;Begin Log, 2021-06-03 04:48 PST&gt;**

(//Starts with a forest clearing, with Bardolph in Feral Form casually sitting off to the right, his head shifting between points in the trees and sky.//)

**Sandra:** Hey Bard! You can come back over now! Eve is decent!

(//Bardolph turns his head to look, smiles, and runs over.//)

**Sandra:** First, I want to say I&#39;m sorry for doubting you, and calling you a pervert.

(//Bardolph stops in front of her, panting and wagging his tail.//)

**Bardolph:** No worries! I&#39;m used to it. Unfortunately, it&#39;s still a common misconception about Furries.

**Sandra:** Heh, finally fessing up, I see.

(//Evelynn clears her throat.//)

**Evelynn:** Both of you, please be silent for at least a minute while I make a formal introduction.

(//Video flip transitions to show a white// Dama dama //doe head with humanoid eyes and brow, on a human body wearing a black turtleneck sweater dress.//)

**Evelynn:** This is Dr. Evelynn Antleur, S.C.P. Foundation Researcher, Level 3. Unfortunately, I am now an SCP-6090-B instance, infection source species: //Dama dama//, the Fallow Deer. The two other SCP-6090-B instances are my associates.

(//Video flip transitions back to Sandra, who is snapping off low thick branches. Bardolph is watching her curiously.//)

**Evelynn:** Sandra Collins, SCP-6090-B instance 4342, infection source species: //Canis latrans//, the Common Coyote, and Dr. Bardolph Dalton, employee of Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions, infection source species: //Canis lupus//, the Gray Wolf.

(//Sandra sits down on the ground, sets the broken branches next to her, takes off her backpack, unzips it and withdraws a multi-tool from it.//)

**Bardolph:** Sandy, what exactly are you doing?

**Sandra:** Gonna make some pikes to make that weasel go pop.

(//Sandra flicks a saw out and begins quickly cutting the ends off the branches.//)

**Bardolph:** Sorry, but, are you insane?! You know that won&#39;t work, and it&#39;ll get you killed.

**Sandra:** And what would you suggest, Bard? Let that asshole torture us for a //million fucking years//?!

(//Sandra finishes the last branch, flicks the saw back and flicks out a knife.//)

**Bardolph:** We try to find a way out of this place, or at least wait it out until the Supervisors, err, the Foundation, send reinforcements in here.

**Evelynn:** I agree with Bardolph. Please stop this, it&#39;s a waste of time.

(//Sandra starts whittling the smaller ends of the branches into sharp points.//)

**Sandra:** And what if those reinforcements never come? What if they can&#39;t get in, or they can&#39;t find us because that weasel has made this place like a maze? We&#39;ve already seen that he has complete control over the trees.

**Evelynn:** The Foundation has countless resources for navigating anomalous, non-Euclidean spaces. There are several Mobile Task Forces that specialize in doing just that. They will be able to reach us, contain Belette Le Fou(ine), and evacuate us from this space.

**Sandra:** Well, I ain&#39;t waiting on these &#39;task forces&#39; to save our asses. We don&#39;t know what that thing&#39;s going to do to us next, how long he plans on keeping us alive, and if he&#39;ll even give us anymore moments alone. I won&#39;t be tortured, and I won&#39;t go down without a fight. I&#39;m sick of this bullshit!

(//Sandra raises her hackles and growls. Her ears fold back and her whittling becomes more vigorous.//)

**Bardolph:** Please, Sandy, don&#39;t do this. Belette Le Fou(ine) seems willing to talk, and we can probably keep him talking to drag things out until help arrives.

**Evelynn:** I agree on taking a more diplomatic approach, though with your current mood and attitude, I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s possible.

**Sandra:** And how long would you two drag things out? You know we&#39;ll need to drink after four days, and eat eventually, right? I don&#39;t know about you guys, but I won&#39;t be consuming anything from this forest. I&#39;ve got three protein bars and a water bottle that we stretch as long as we can, but then that&#39;s it.

**Evelynn:** You do actually have a point there.

(//Bardolph whimpers and sulks.//)

**Bardolph:** Yeah, haven&#39;t had the time to think about that until now.

(//Sandra chuckles. Her whittling slows, her ears prick back up, and her expression relaxes.//)

**Sandra:** Yeah, I do, don&#39;t I? Surprised basic bodily needs didn&#39;t already occur to someone as smart as you. We&#39;ll probably have to sleep in shifts too, and we&#39;re already overtired from the road trip.

(//Sandra speeds up her whittling.//)

**Sandra:** And what if, in the process of &#39;diplomacy&#39; and &#39;dragging things out,&#39; that weasel serves us up some shit he&#39;s done God-knows-what to? Throws us a little tea party? What will you two do then? What if he says he&#39;ll kill you if you don&#39;t accept it?

(//Bardolph whimpers louder. Sandra finishes off the last spear and stands up.//)

**Evelynn:** I&#39;ll politely decline and attempt to shift the subject.

(//Sandra dons her backpack and keeps her multi-tool in hand.//)

**Sandra:** Yeah, good luck with that. I ain&#39;t playing along, though.

(//Sandra picks up the spears with her other arm and starts walking around the outskirts of the clearing.//)

**Bardolph:** Maybe she does have a point, Eve.

(//Sandra drives two spears into the ground behind a tree she didn&#39;t damage.//)

**Evelynn:** I will try my best to preserve my own life, in spite of her efforts.

(//Sandra repeats the process with other undamaged trees.//)

**Bardolph:** And what about her?

**Evelynn:** She will likely get herself killed if she attempts this folly.

(//Bardolph whines.//)

**Evelynn:** I will do what I can to save her with negotiation, but if it comes down to my life or hers, I&#39;ll choose mine.

(//Sandra runs out of spears, walks over to one of the trees she pulled branches from, and begins carving into its trunk.//)

**Bardolph:** Don&#39;t talk like that Eve! We&#39;re in this together!

**Evelynn:** Again, I will do my best. It would be a shame to lose a subject as unique as her. There&#39;s so much we could learn about both [[[SCP-3577]]] and SCP-6090 by just studying her alone.

(//Sandra finishes carving an obscene phrase into the trunk. Her ears twitch and swivel as she moves onto the next one.//)

**Bardolph:** Is that all she is to you? A test subject?

**Evelynn:** She is an unprecedented sapient instance of SCP-3577. We could be looking at years of research in her case.

(//Sandra carves into the next tree more intensely than the last, with broader and deeper knife strokes.//)

**Bardolph:** Years?! Eve, you can&#39;t be serious.

**Evelynn:** Dr. Dalton, from one scientist to another, take my advice: It&#39;s best not to get attached to anomalous objects, especially humanoid ones.

**Bardolph:** You know you have to let her leave, under the F.A.C.T. Agreement.

**Evelynn:** Her retroactive reality bending abilities are not fully understood and that makes her a potential threat to herself and others. We are well within our rights to contain her indefinitely under the exception clauses of that Agreement, just as we are within our rights under the Boring Agreement to confiscate and contain any threatening anomalous animals from your organization.

(//Bardolph whines loudly.//)

**Evelynn:** You should be well aware by now that neither the U.I.U. nor W.W.S. have any jurisdiction in her case.

(//Sandra has since finished off the second tree and moved onto a third, carving into it with noteably excessive force.//)

**Bardolph:** What am I supposed to tell her?

**Evelynn:** You don&#39;t tell her anything. Just go along with our usual ruses. Stay as terse as you can, nod your head in agreement with us, and gradually break off all contact with her.

(//Bardolph whimpers.//)

**Evelynn:** It&#39;s for the best, Bardolph. The Foundation always knows what&#39;s best.

(//Sandra finishes off the third tree and pounds against it with her fist.//)

**Bardolph:** (//Sighs.//) Yeah, I know the deal. I&#39;ll do my best, just like with the others.

(//Sandra stops pounding and takes deep breaths. Her face is in anguish.//)

**Evelynn:** Good boy.

(//Sandra moves onto a fourth tree and stabs into it with her knife.//)

**Evelynn:** Well, she seems to be rather upset again.

**Bardolph:** Can you blame her? I mean, given what we&#39;re up against.

**Evelynn:** It really is overkill, even for such futile actions.

**Bardolph:** Heh, says the woman who bucked the crap out of a tree trunk when we realized we were trapped here. Cut her some slack!

**Evelynn:** Fair enough.

(//Sandra finishes carving one curse word into the trunk. She pants and pounds on the tree.//)

**Bardolph:** We should focus on what to do when Belette Le Fou(ine) returns.

(//Sandra relaxes her facial expression and her chest heaving slows.//)

**Evelynn:** It would be best if you followed my lead on that as well, unless the situation worsens. In which case, you&#39;re welcome to improvise however you like to give us all the best chance of survival.

(//Sandra walks back towards the camera with a neutral expression on her face.//)

**Bardolph:** You feeling better, love? Did you get it out of your system?

**Evelynn:** I trust you&#39;re ready to follow our plan, despite how much you may have already compromised it with your actions.

**Sandra:** Yeah, no. You two can sing and dance for that pompous weasel all you want, but I&#39;m sticking with my plan. If anything, you&#39;ll both probably be a better distraction and give me a better opening to finish what the guards started.

**Bardolph:** Sandy, please don&#39;t do this. You&#39;ll just get yourself killed.

**Sandra:** No, I&#39;m official done with this bullshit. All of it. Either I take that fucker down, or I go down swinging.

**Evelynn:** (//Sighs.//) It&#39;s obvious now I&#39;d be wasting my time trying to convince you otherwise. When your brash actions inevitably fail, Bardolph and I will do our best to convince Belette Le Fou(ine) to overlook them and spare your life.

**Sandra:** Heh, it almost sounds like you&#39;re actually on //his// side now.

**Bardolph:** We&#39;re on your side, love, and we always will be.

**Sandra:** If you say so.

**Bardolph:** Hey now! We&#39;re all in the same boat here.

**Sandra:** Of course we are...

(//Sandra looks at Bardolph and her expression brightens up.//)

**Sandra:** I mean, yeah, with this whole prison and its weasel warden.

(//Sandra lifts her arms and twirls around.//)

**Bardolph:** That&#39;s the spirit! Speaking of which, we need to get ready for when Belette Le Fou(ine) comes ba...

(//Owl screeches. Camera view shifts to show an owl with an elongated object in its talons growing larger. Belette Le Fou(ine) is floating next to it.//)

**Sandra:** What the fuck now?!

(//Owl releases the elongated object, which screams and continues to grow larger and oddly shaped as it falls.//)

**Bardolph:** It can&#39;t be!

(//Bardolph runs toward the object as it rustles leaves and breaks branches falling through the trees. Evelynn chases after him with the camera.//)

**Bardolph:** Ace! Is that you?!

(//Object&#39;s fall stops on the end of a thick lower branch. It bounces up and down with the object draped over it. A smaller object falls off one end of it.//)

**Atticus:** (//Coughs.//) Who else would it be?!

(//Atticus is in the form of a// Crotalus atrox //specimen as large as a full grown// Eunectes murinus //[[footnote]]Green Giant Anaconda.[[/footnote]]. He has a stunted, scale-covered, human-like upper torso with arms along the length of his body, and an equally stunted and scaly human-like lower torso with legs further down the length of his body.//)

**Bardolph:** Oh my God, you&#39;re bleeding!

(//Camera shifts position to show 8 fresh gashes along the length of Atticus&#39; body.//)

**Atticus:** It&#39;s okay. (//Coughs.//) They&#39;re just superficial wounds, or at least I hope they are.

**Bardolph:** They still look pretty bad, and were probably worse before you started transforming.

**Bardolph:** Eve! Tear off your sweater sleeves! I need them now!

(//Video shifts to a view of the sky as Evelynn sets down her camera. Fabric tearing.//)

**Atticus:** Did I even finish transforming? (//Coughs.//) I feel really weird now, even weirder than when I first became a Therianthrope an hour ago.

**Bardolph:** No, you&#39;re in some kind of intermediate form between your Base Form and Feral Form.

**Atticus:** (//Winces.//) Woah, you&#39;re right. I look like some kind of Chinese Dragon Rattlesnake Hybrid.

**Bardolph:** Try not to move right now. I&#39;m going to dress your wounds first.

**Atticus:** Shouldn&#39;t I simply finish transforming to heal them?

**Bardolph:** No way, mate. We don&#39;t know how bad they are. Transforming could make them worse instead of better.

(//Atticus winces and grunts.//)

**Bardolph:** Besides, you got an intermediate form after being a Therian for only an hour! Lucky!

(//Atticus grunts in pain.//)

**Bardolph:** I&#39;ve been one for years and I&#39;m still trying to develop a good intermediate form for myself.

**Atticus:** I&#39;m... not exactly sure how I even assumed this form. I was assuming my Base Form to escape that owl, but I guess I collided with the trees before I could finish transforming.

**Bardolph:** Well, you need to stay in that form until you&#39;ve healed a little, and commit it to muscle memory in the meantime, so you can access it in the future.

(//Atticus winces.//)

**Evelynn:** (//Sighs.//) Bardolph, could you please assume //your// Feral Form again?

**Bardolph:** Not until I&#39;ve gotten Ace down. Ace, you ready?

**Atticus:** Yeah. I think I still have my locomotion gastrosteges, so I should be able to help.

**Bardolph:** Okay, but be careful. I&#39;m going to start pulling now. (//Grunts.//)

(//Wood creaking. Atticus winces.//)

**Evelynn:** Ugh, it&#39;s a good thing my phone&#39;s camera is pointed skyward right now.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** (//Giggles.//) Mmmm, yes it is. Now the wolf has decided to disregard decency to save his friend.

**Atticus:** You really are a piece of work, you know that? (//Winces.//) Are you enjoying my suffering?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Very much so! Thank you so much for asking.

**Evelynn:** How long do you intend to keep us trapped in this anomalous forest before you kill us?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** For as long as you humans continue to amuse me, and this right here is quite amusing. (//Cackles.//)

**Bardolph:** Okay, one last pull.

(//Atticus winces and yells. Heavy thud.//)

**Atticus:** Thanks!

**Bardolph:** Any time!

**Evelynn:** Bardolph, please assume your Feral Form now.

**Bardolph:** Right, will do!

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** So it seems my experiment was a success, and my theory was proven correct.

**Evelynn:** Your experiment?

(//Evelynn lifts the camera off the ground. Video shows Atticus on his ventral side, wiggling his legs and pushing up with his arms to attempt to stand upright.//)

**Atticus:** So all this really was your doing?

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) giggles. Video pans to show it standing on the ground in front of Atticus and Bardolph.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Since you Jailers have run out of notes to compare, or simply don&#39;t want to share, let&#39;s make some new ones now!

**Evelynn:** In that case, what was the theory that you mentioned earlier?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** That blunt force trauma applied mid-transformation can stop it halfway and unlock intermediate forms as a result.

**Evelynn:** Huh, very interesting, actually. We hadn&#39;t thought of trying such an experiment on an SCP-6090-B instance yet.

**Bardolph:** Eve, you aren&#39;t seriously condoning this?

**Evelynn:** No I am not. There are definitely safer, more controlled ways to induce such trauma. Perhaps a Taser.

**Bardolph:** Right, because that&#39;s so much better.

**Atticus:** It certainly would have been better than falling through tree branches.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** I might not have one of those, but I have so many other, more natural resources at my disposal. There are so many more experiments I can perform! The only question is: What to do to all of you next? (//Cackles.//) Oh, we&#39;re going to have so much fuuuuuUUUUU...

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) screams in pain. A wooden spear is now protruding from its left thigh. Silvery blue blood drips from the wound.//)

**Evelynn:** That foolish girl really is going through with it.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) ducks down to grab the spear, right as another flies over its back.//)

**Evelynn:** I want to apologize for Sandra&#39;s behavior! Please don&#39;t do anything rash because of her.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) pulls the spear out and screams. Silvery blue blood begins to pour out of the wound.//)

**Bardolph:** Holy crap, we really could have a shot!

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) looks over in panic and levitates out of the way as another spear flies past him.//)

**Evelynn:** Stop it! He will probably kill all of us after this!

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) winces and giggles painfully.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** You&#39;re right to fear me, my dear, and you ne&#39;er-do-wells are lucky I still can&#39;t use my right hand.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) reaches into its dress jacket, pulls out a seaweed-like substance and applies it to its leg wound.//)

**Bardolph:** You aren&#39;t keeping us here anymore!

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) groans in pain and dodges as Bardolph lunges with his mouth open. The seaweed grows to cover its wound and staunch the bleeding.//)

**Atticus:** Heh, judging by the trail, you&#39;ve now lost a lot more blood than I have.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) narrowly dodges another spear. It waves its hand and toadstools start growing around it.//)

**Atticus:** How does it feel, //I wonder//.

(//Bardolph lunges at Belette Le Fou(ine) from behind.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** It no longer feels amusing.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) dodges the lunge and waves its hand again. Several toadstool caps detach from their stems and fly through the air.//)

**Bardolph:** I&#39;m not chasing after your mushroom Frisbees!

(//Bardolph lunges at Belette Le Fou(ine), but several toadstool caps fly towards him.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** No, but they&#39;ll chase after you!

(//Bardolph manages to catch one flying toadstool cap in his mouth, but two more collide with his torso.//)

**Evelynn:** Bardolph!

(//Bardolph whines in pain and tumbles to the ground. Belette Le Fou(ine) cackles and waves its left hand in blurring motions. A spear is stopped mid-flight with a kinetohazard.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Let&#39;s have no more of that either, shall we?

(//The spear drops to the ground. Bardolph shakily starts to stand back up. Belette Le Fou(ine) giggles and looks in Sandra&#39;s direction with a malicious grin.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** You&#39;ve been a very naughty girl.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) waves its hand and Sandra screams. Camera swings over to show tree roots sprouting from the ground and wrapping around her legs.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** It seems you&#39;ve also carved profanities into several of my trees.

(//Sandra trips over backwards and falls onto her butt and elbows. Tree roots sprout and wrap themselves around her forearms.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Very naughty indeed.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) rapidly flies into view and abruptly stops to float directly above her.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** You&#39;re such a special girl. It would be a shame if I had to kill you.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) licks its lips and places its tongue on its upper teeth.//)

**Sandra:** God, you really are worse than my ex!

(//Sandra spits on Belette Le Fou(ine)&#39;s tuxedo jacket.//)

**Sandra:** You might call them &#39;Jailers,&#39; but you&#39;re the real &#39;Jailer&#39; here, imprisoning us in this forest. Sure, it&#39;s a picturesque prison, but it&#39;s still a prison.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** (//Giggles.//) That&#39;s enough naughty words out of your dirty muzzle.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) waves its hand. Vines grow out of the ground and over Sandra&#39;s shoulder, wrapping around her muzzle.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** You know, I don&#39;t have to kill you right now. Maybe we can compromise.

(//Sandra raises her hackles and growls.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Perhaps you&#39;ll stop throwing things and behave better if I blinded you.

(//Sandra whimpers and struggles against the vines. Bardolph growls and barks.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Of course, since I only have one hand, we&#39;ll have to do this one eye at a time, but really, it&#39;s more enjoyable that way.

(//Bardolph runs up and lunges at its left arm. Belette Le Fou(ine) waves its left hand and two more toadstool caps collide with him mid-air. They stick to his body and begin clamping down on it.//)

**Bardolph:** What the heck?! I can&#39;t get them off!

(//Bardolph whines in pain and collapses to the ground.//)

**Atticus:** Bard!

(//Atticus tries to stand. His body ungulates and falls over.//)

**Atticus:** Dammit, my torso&#39;s like a wet noodle. I should probably just slither.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) places its left hand on the right side of Sandra&#39;s face. Sandra makes a muffled scream.//)

**Bardolph:** Oh God, they&#39;re breaking my ribs!

(//Bardolph howls in pain.//)

**Atticus:** Hang on, I&#39;m coming!

(//Atticus slithers over to him, dragging his legs but keeping his arms off the ground.//)

**Evelynn:** Please don&#39;t do this! If you injure Bardolph and impair Sandra&#39;s sight, you won&#39;t be able to perform as many tests. Isn&#39;t that what you want?

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** But don&#39;t you see, Jailer? I&#39;m performing a test right now: testing the pain tolerance of Therianthropes.

(//Atticus pulls on edge of the mushroom cap with his child-sized arms, but it doesn&#39;t budge.//)

**Atticus:** Damn baby arms! I don&#39;t think I can get them off.

(//Bardolph whines and coughs.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Keep recording this, so we have all the data, and be sure to get my good side.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) holds his left thumb just above Sandra&#39;s right eye, ready to press down.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Oh, and if you even think of interfering, I&#39;ll blind you next.

**Atticus:** Please, release these toadstool vices! They&#39;re going to crush him!

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Sorry, lad, but the wolf, like her, needs to be taught a lesson.

(//Atticus hisses, opens his mouth, and sinks his fangs into the toadstool cap. It slackens and shrivels.//)

**Atticus:** Holy shit, that actually worked!

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) cringes and winces, removing its hand from Sandra&#39;s face.//)

**Atticus:** And now the other one.

(//Atticus bites into the second toadstool cap, causing Belette Le Fou(ine) to wince again as it withers and dies.//)

**Atticus:** Bard, are you okay?!

(//Bardolph takes ragged, raspy breaths.//)

**Bardolph:** Right... knackered... (//Coughs.//) But still alive. (//Coughs.//) Ribs positively cracked... though. Hard to... (//Coughs.//) breathe...

**Atticus:** Try not to talk anymore, then. Just focus on staying alive.

(//Bardolph nods weakly. Belette Le Fou(ine) growls.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** No matter, I can deal with them later.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) smiles, giggles and places its left thumb on Sandra&#39;s closed right eye.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Now, where were we, my dear?

(//Sandra struggles and quietly screams.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Oh, come now, don&#39;t fret. You&#39;re about to be part of an exciting experiment!

**CSR-05:** HEY! I&#39;VE GOT AN EXPERIMENT FOR YOU!

(//Camera turns to show a male Foundation guard with a longhorn bull head, fully armored and loaded out with as many guns and magazines as he could carry, pointing one at Belette Le Fou(ine).//)

**Atticus:** What the fuck?! An MTF Minotaur?!

**CSR-05:** Sorry I took so long, I had to prepare.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) cackles and releases his hand from Sandra.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Now this is quite the unexpected treat! And here I thought I killed all of you.

**CSR-05:** Frankly, I&#39;m just as surprised I&#39;m not dead.

**Atticus:** You got infected and transforming fixed your superficial wounds, that&#39;s how.

**CSR-05:** Yeah, probably.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) guffaws and climbs off Sandra.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** You might not be dead now, but you soon will be.

**CSR-05:** Yeah, we&#39;ll just see about that.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** And what, pray tell, is this experiment of yours? I hope it&#39;s something more creative than just shooting at me.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) wiggles and twists its fingers, blurring them and some of the air around him.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Your fellow guards already tried that experiment, and it thoroughly failed.

**CSR-05:** Nah. Was thinking I&#39;d try this first.

(//CSR-05 quickly swings his arm to point his gun at the tree trunk next to him and fires a few rounds into it.//)

**Atticus:** What the fuck?!

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) cries in agony, bending down and grabbing its forearm wound.//)

**CSR-05:** Just as I thought. You feel this forest&#39;s pain.

**Atticus:** Huh, was starting to suspect that too.

**CSR-05:** Yeah, saw him double over in pain when the Gauss felled a few of the trees.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) looks up at CSR-05 with fury. CSR-05 fires another round. It screams.//)

**CSR-05:** Well, I&#39;m about to cause you a whole lot more pain for what you did to my team.

(//CSR-05 looks at Atticus and pulls out a serrated knife.//)

**CSR-05:** Dr. Rateleken, get yourself and Dr. Dalton to cover.

(//CSR-05 looks at Evelynn, shoots the tree again and tosses the knife to her side.//)

**CSR-05:** Dr. Antleur, free the coyote girl and do the same.

(//CSR-05 shoots the tree twice more and turns back to Belette Le Fou(ine).//)

**CSR-05:** And as for you, I&#39;m just getting started. LET&#39;S FUCKING GO!

(//CSR-05 grabs a second gun with his other hand, shoots two other trees and runs out of sight. Belette Le Fou(ine) shakily stands and levitates after him.//)

**Atticus:** Come on, Bard, you gotta try to stand.

(//Evelynn grabs the knife and cuts the base of the vine wrapped around Sandra&#39;s muzzle. It withers and falls away.//)

**Sandra:** I almost lost an eye! You can keep filming this shit after freeing me.

**Evelynn:** Right, of course.

(//Evelynn sets the camera down to face the sky again. Gunfire and Belette Le Fou(ine)&#39;s laughter continue throughout.//)

**Sandra:** Free my left arm first and hand me my multi-tool. It&#39;s right over there.

**Evelynn:** Yes, I see it.

...

**Sandra:** Thanks! Now get started on my legs. I&#39;ll free my right arm.

**Evelynn:** That was my plan too.

...

**Sandra:** Finally! I guess this is one time you&#39;re willing to set me free.

**Evelynn:** I don&#39;t know what you mean by that, but we need to get to cover now.

(//Evelynn comes into view of the camera and picks it back up. Belette Le Fou(ine) chases after CSR-05, occasionally stopping to cringe in pain.//)

**Atticus:** Over hear! Hurry!

(//Bardolph leans against a large boulder, raggedly breathing. Atticus is feeling Bardolph&#39;s chest for damage.//)

**Atticus:** I hope that weasel can&#39;t control rocks too.

(//Sandra runs over to them with Evelynn following.//)

**Sandra:** We need to figure out how to kill that thing. Maybe if we wreck the forest enough.

**Evelynn:** I&#39;ll remind you the entire forest could collapse in on itself if it dies.

**Sandra:** I don&#39;t know about you, but that weasel&#39;s probably gonna kill us after this.

(//Camera turns to show CSR-05 knocking over some smaller trees with his bare hands while shooting larger ones.//)

**Sandra:** If you&#39;re right, we&#39;re dead either way, so who cares?

**Evelynn:** My plan is to let the guard handle containing Belette Le Fou(ine).

**Sandra:** This is our endgame and we need our own plan, or we&#39;re all dead.

(//CSR-05 discards a spent gun and grabs another.//)

**Sandra:** That guard doesn&#39;t have infinite ammo, and I don&#39;t know what his plan is other than making an opening for us.

**Atticus:** I could bite Belette Le Fou(ine). My venom would knock him flat, but it probably wouldn&#39;t kill him.

**Evelynn:** Hmmm, that may actually work. //Crotalus// venom isn&#39;t immediately fatal. Can you control the dosage?

**Atticus:** I can&#39;t say it&#39;ll be very accurate. Only thing I&#39;ve bitten were those mushroom vices.

**Evelynn:** Try not to send it into shock if you can. That should ensure its organs remain undamaged for long term containment.

**Sandra:** Wow, that is literally all you think about, isn&#39;t it?

**Evelynn:** Securing and Containing the anomalous to Protect the rest of the world is the Foundation&#39;s primary directive.

**Sandra:** And you never think beyond that, do you?

**Atticus:** Now is really not the time for this debate!

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** (//Cackling.//) Looks like you&#39;re almost out of ammunition. What then?

**CSR-05:** Well, I find out the secret to your amazingly high pain tolerance.

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Honestly, I&#39;ve grown numb to the pain by now.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) waves its arm and toadstool caps fly at CSR-05.//)

**CSR-05:** Guess I should slow down to let your pain receptors recover.

(//CSR-05 shoots down the toadstool caps.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** The moment you slow down is the moment you die.

**CSR-05:** Okay, I&#39;ll speed up then!

(//CSR-05 weaves through the trees at a sprint, outrunning the caps as they collide with trunks.//)

**Evelynn:** Impressive physical enhancements.

**Atticus:** They&#39;re moving so fast, I don&#39;t know how I&#39;ll even get close.

**Sandra:** I still have some spears hidden around here.

**Atticus:** Go use them! Eve, make a distraction!

**Evelynn:** What am I supposed to do?!

**Atticus:** What you do best: lecture him!

(//Sandra runs off. Atticus pets Bardolph.//)

**Atticus:** Looks like some bruising and hairline fractures at worst. Just, try to stay out of sight, okay?

**Bardolph:** Will... do...

(//Atticus slithers off. Evelynn runs out into the field.//)

**Evelynn:** Why not spare him for your experiments?! He&#39;s another Therianthrope now, after all!

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) stops, winces in pain and turns towards Evelynn with a malicious grin.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Oh no, my dear. He&#39;s far too naughty to let live.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) wiggles its fingers into blurs. Several bullets and a spear are stopped by kinetohazards.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** In fact, so is everyone else here.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) waves its arm and toadstool caps fly towards Evelynn.//)

**Evelynn:** Wait, I never attacked you!

(//Kinetoglyphs vanish. The bullets and spear drop to the ground.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** But you no longer amuse me.

(//Evelynn rapidly leaps and dodges several toadstool caps.//)

**Evelynn:** Huh, I&#39;ve never been able to move and jump like this before!

(//Evelynn starts laughing as she dodges more toadstool caps.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** You&#39;re quite the agile deer, my dear. Let&#39;s do something about that!

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) waves its arm. Evelynn trips, falls, and yells.//)

**Evelynn:** Please, no!

(//Toadstool caps are shot apart before they reach Evelynn. Her ankle is twisted and trapped under tree roots.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** You shouldn&#39;t be a problem now.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) lands on the ground next to Evelynn. It cringes and groans in pain.//)

**Evelynn:** What are you going to do to me?

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) giggles and wiggles its fingers, stopping several more bullets mid-air.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Why, the same thing I was about to do to the coyote, of course.

**Evelynn:** Please don&#39;t, I&#39;m much more valuable sighted.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) cries in pain. Gunfire in the background.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** But first, I&#39;ll handle the other nuisances.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) rapidly gesticulates its entire left arm, blurring the air around itself as the still floating bullets begin the gyrate.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** It seems that you&#39;re almost out of ammunition. How about I do you a kindness, and...

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) makes some final motions and the bullets rapidly fly back towards CSR-05.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** ...return some of it to you!

(//CSR-05 screams as one hits his shoulder and another his stomach. He fires the gun in his other hand at Belette Le Fou(ine)&#39;s head.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Again with the headshots?

(//CSR-05 pulls out a piece of metal with a cloth wrapped around it as he starts to collapse.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** What do you hope to accomplish? I&#39;ll stop anything you throw at m...

(//CSR-05 throws the metal with all his might as he falls. The cloth unravels mid-air, revealing markings on it drawn in blood.//)

**Evelynn:** Antikinetoglyphs...

(//Green kinetoglyphs appear around it as it gets close. They instantly disappear and the metal keeps moving, embedding itself into Belette Le Fou(ine)&#39;s thigh, just above its knee.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** What the...?!

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) makes a blood curdling shriek and collapses. Silvery blue blood seeps from the wound as the surrounding tissue inflames and blisters.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** Oh, my Queen! IT BURNS!

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) grabs it with both hands, but pulls them away seconds later and screams again. Second degree burn marks are visible on both its palms.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** PLEASE! SOMEONE! MAKE IT STOP! OH, MY QUEEN, IT BURNS SO BAD!!

(//Evelynn dislodges her foot, crawls over to Belette Le Fou(ine) and punches it in the eye.//)

**Evelynn:** That&#39;s for threatening to blind me!

(//Evelynn sits up and looks down on him.//)

**Evelynn:** I look forward to studying you in containment.

(//Belette Le Fou(ine) laughs weakly in between grunts of pain.//)

**Belette Le Fou(ine):** And how... are you... going to... contain me?

**Evelynn:** Immobilization via //Crotalus// venom. Dr. Rateleken, you may administer the injection now!

(//Atticus slithers out from behind a nearby tree, having regained his phone.//)

**Atticus:** With //great// pleasure, Dr. Antleur.

**Atticus:** Who&#39;s &#39;WE&#39;?!

**Bardolph:** Is it... finally... over?

(//Bardolph stumbles towards the group and CSR-05 crawls over to them.//)

**Atticus:** Bard, try to conserve your strength!

(//Atticus falls over and curls around to touch his bloody bandages.//)

**Atticus:** Shit! All that slithering reopened my talon wounds.

**Bardolph:** Heh... Guess we&#39;re both... pretty knackered now.

(//Bardolph falls over next to Atticus. They both laugh weakly.//)

**CSR-05:** Well that was quite the ordeal.

**Evelynn:** Are you alright Terr... Convoy Guard Five?

**CSR-05:** I&#39;ve been worse.

**Evelynn:** Unfortunately, I have also sustained an injury.

**CSR-05:** Don&#39;t worry. Help should be here soon from the nearest Provisional Site.

**Evelynn:** Any ETA?

**CSR-05:** Still can&#39;t get a signal, but the sun&#39;s almost up, so it&#39;s been about... 75 minutes.

**Atticus:** Damn. All that in just an hour.

**CSR-05:** Shouldn&#39;t be much longer now.

**Atticus:** Good. We could all use medical, except Sandy.

**CSR-05:** The coyote girl?

**Atticus:** Lucky girl, especially since she came within an inch of losing an eye.

**CSR-05:** Why is she walking toward the road, anyway?

**Evelynn:** Sandra! What exactly are you doing?

**Sandra:** Oh, just uh... getting a closer look at that battery fire.

(//Sandra stops walking and puts her hand above her eyes.//)

**Sandra:** I really hope it doesn&#39;t spread into the field now.

**Evelynn:** And what exactly is that in your other hand?

(//Sandra tightens her grip on a large, antique compass in her other hand.//)

**Sandra:** What, it&#39;s just my phone.

**Evelynn:** That doesn&#39;t look like your phone.

**Atticus:** Sandy? What are you doing?

**CSR-05:** Wait, that&#39;s a Lewis &amp; Clark Compass!

**Evelynn:** How did you even get that?!

**Sandra:** (//Sighs.//) Probably the same way I got my binoculars.

**Evelynn:** You couldn&#39;t have possibly bought something like that, which means...

**Sandra:** That somehow, some way, in the past I just rewrote with my new magical coyote powers, I stole it from that other guard.

**Evelynn:** And what were you planning on doing with it?

**Atticus:** Wait... you had that escape device this whole time, and didn&#39;t share it?

**Sandra:** No! I only just now found it in my backpack... though I was thinking about it the whole time we were in there. I must have made the compass appear inside it the same way I got my binoculars.

**Evelynn:** So you could have gotten us out the forest this whole time?!

**Sandra:** I don&#39;t know?! Didn&#39;t the guard say it only works on one person, anyway?

**Evelynn:** You could have given it Dr. Dalton or myself to escape and contact reinforcements.

**Sandra:** Maybe I... just wanted to keep it for myself.

**Evelynn:** Sandra Collins, I sincerely hope you aren&#39;t thinking about escaping.

**Atticus:** Sandy, please, don&#39;t do this.

**Evelynn:** Can you stop her?!

**CSR-05:** Don&#39;t think so. Out of ammo and anything I can throw. I don&#39;t even think I can stand, but I&#39;ll damn well try.

(//Sandra takes a few steps back and starts fiddling with the compass.//)

**Bardolph:** Sandy...

(//CSR-05 strains to get up, but falls back down again. Atticus starts to slither forward, but stops and grabs his wounds.//)

**Sandra:** I&#39;m sorry, Bard. I really hope you, at least, were looking out for me in the end, but I heard your conversation with Eve. All of it.

(//Bardolph whines. Sandy continues to walk backwards, looking between them and the compass.//)

**Evelynn:** I suspected you might have, but I still didn&#39;t think you&#39;d be reckless enough to even consider this.

(//Evelynn tries to stand, but yells and falls when she puts weight on her ankle.//)

**Sandra:** From the moment I woke up with this face, I knew I would never lead a normal life again. But you, Bard, and the other Therians, at least gave me hope that I could lead some kind of life looking like this.

**Bardolph:** You... still... could...

**Sandra:** But before that, when I first saw myself in the mirror, only one thought came to mind: I&#39;m a freak now, and the government is going to haul me away to a lab somewhere, and poke and prod me until the day I die, or the day they decide to dissect me.

(//Evelynn tries to stand again, but falls and begins crawling her way towards Sandra.//)

**Sandra:** I even had nightmares about it the first few nights, but even then I never thought they&#39;d turn out to be premonitions.

**Evelynn:** Think carefully about what you&#39;re about to do, SCP-6090-B instance 4342. You will become a criminal, and the U.I.U. won&#39;t be on your side anymore.

**Sandra:** From what I heard you say, they were never on my side, and neither were you, and I would never have a future outside of my nightmares.

**Atticus:** That thing is random. What if you end up in the middle of nowhere? Or worse, in a city or any kind of crowd?

**Sandra:** If it&#39;s the former, then I&#39;ll live as a wild coyote for a while. They have pretty good range. And if I thread that needle and get the latter, well, it is what it is, and I&#39;ll find a way to deal with it.

**Evelynn:** You won&#39;t get far. We can track your phone!

**Sandra:** Yeah, my phone&#39;s a TeraCube 2e, and I&#39;ve already taken its battery out, so no power to track it.

(//Evelynn crawls closer, but Sandra jumps backwards.//)

**Sandra:** I&#39;m sorry, but the fact I was even able to rewrite the past to somehow steal this thing is a sign. These magic powers seem to run on my greatest desire, and right now my greatest desire is the freedom to chart my own course in life... with this compass. Heh.

**Evelynn:** We will find you and contain you. It&#39;s only a matter of time.

**Sandra:** Eve, I really feel sorry for you. I don&#39;t know who hurt you, but I hope someday you realize how much you&#39;re hurting others.

**Atticus:** Sandy, I&#39;m sorry you feel that way about the Foundation.

**Sandra:** Ace, I really hope you&#39;re better than she is, but I&#39;m not sure anymore. Never really got to know you, and now I won&#39;t get the chance.

(//Evelynn stands and tries to hobble towards her, only to fall down after a few steps.//)

**Sandra:** I might not ever be able to get my old life back, but I&#39;ll be damned if I live my worst nightmare for the rest of it. Even if you guys catch up to me, I&#39;ll just use the compass again. And if that doesn&#39;t work, well... I guess I&#39;ll just off myself, if only to rob you of your precious &#34;unprecedented sapient instance of SCP-3577,&#34; or whatever you want to call me.

(//Clicking noise. Sandra&#39;s expression brightens. The compass&#39; North and South poles split apart and begin rotating in opposite directions.//)

**Sandra:** Yes! Finally!

(//Evelynn stands up and starts walking, groaning in pain with each step. Sandra turns and runs away.//)

**Evelynn:** You aren&#39;t escaping!

(//Compass&#39; arms speed up into a blur. Sandra vanishes. Evelynn falls down, rolls on her back, and cries while clutching her ankle.//)

**Evelynn:** CSR-05... make sure to... log Sandra Collins... SCP-6090-B-4342... as a Person of Interest...

(//The sun rises. Shortly after, a black unmarked MRAP Truck[[footnote]]Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Truck.[[/footnote]] crests over the hill on the road.//)

**CSR-05:** Yeah, I&#39;ll get right on that... when I&#39;m not lying on the ground in pain.

(//The MRAP Truck drives off the road just before reaching the convoy remains and stops in front of the group.//)

**Atticus:** At least the cavalry&#39;s finally here, albeit late.

(//The MRAP Truck flashes the Foundation symbol on its side. Agent Benson and several other armed guards disembark and survey the situation.//)

**Benson:** Woah, never thought I&#39;d be attending a furry convention out in a field. Then again, these days it is best to keep events like this outdoors.

**Atticus:** Is that really what this looks like to you?!

**Benson:** Come on, you&#39;re all half-animal, and it looks like you all partied pretty hard.

(//Benson gestures towards the still-burning battery fire.//)

**Benson:** You even started a battery bonfire! That&#39;ll sure be fun to put out.

**CSR-05:** Of all the agents they could have sent, why&#39;d it have to be you, Benson?

**Benson:** Funny enough, because I sleep through most of the day. I&#39;m actually good to go around sunrise.

(//The other guards walk around and begin scanning fingerprints and implanted RFID chips.//)

**Benson:** I just happened to be on another mission over at Site-███ when I got called out here...

(//Benson leans over and scans Evelynn&#39;s fingerprints and RFID chip.//)

**Benson:** Oh hey, that really is you Dr. Antleur! Looks like you went from towheaded to doe-headed.

**Evelynn:** Very funny. In case you haven&#39;t noticed, we all need medical attention.

**Benson:** Yeah, that&#39;s pretty clear. You guys must have been up against something fierce.

(//Two guards carefully load CSR-05 onto a stretcher and into the MRAP Truck.//)

**Atticus:** We managed to neutralize it.

(//Benson stretches and contently groans.//)

**Benson:** Glad I didn&#39;t have to fight it.

**Evelynn:** I need you to put a Foundation BOLO Alert on SCP-6090-B-4342, Sandra Collins.

**Benson:** Right, the... uh...

(//Benson checks his tablet.//)

**Benson:** Coyote Girl... Therianthrope, that was with you. Suspected to have [[[SCP-3577]]]&#39;s powers.

**Atticus:** You&#39;re only just now reading the mission briefing?

**Benson:** Hey, they scrambled us shortly after your signal was lost. Barely even had time to get dressed.

**Atticus:** And how long was the drive?

**Benson:** Took over an hour. You&#39;re out in the ass-end of nowhere.

**Atticus:** And you didn&#39;t think to read it en-route?

**Benson:** Nope, not really. So anyway, why didn&#39;t any of you think to slip a tracker on her?

**Evelynn:** We had nine armed guards at the time, and we assumed we could just her track her phone if she somehow managed to evade all of them.

**Benson:** And you can&#39;t track it now because...?

**Evelynn:** She removed the battery.

**Benson:** Was it an older phone?

**Atticus:** New one.

(//Atticus grunts as he&#39;s manually coiled onto a stretcher.//)

**Benson:** Did she mention the brand?

**Atticus:** TeraCube, I think.

**Benson:** Huh, I&#39;ll have to look into that.

(//Two guards lift Atticus up and haul his stretcher into the MRAP Truck.//)

**Benson:** Well, I can understand why you guys didn&#39;t think to check her phone for such a feature. Most new phones suck these days.

**Evelynn:** And that&#39;s why we need to get a BOLO on her ASAP.

**Benson:** I&#39;ll do what I can, but maybe next time, slip backup trackers on your guests.

**Evelynn:** It&#39;s been noted. Now, shouldn&#39;t we be getting an aerial medical evac instead?

**Benson:** The boys have already radioed one in, along with a clean-up team for this mess.

(//Two guards finish getting Bardolph onto a stretcher and into the MRAP Truck.//)

**Benson:** Medical will intercept us on the way back. Gotta cover as much ground as we can in the meantime.

**Evelynn:** The sooner we get back to the Site, the better.

**Benson:** Aw, and here I was looking forward to us having a nice hour-long chat.

**Evelynn:** I wasn&#39;t.

(//Benson leans down and gestures to help her up.//)

**Benson:** You need a hand, or do you want the stretcher?

**Evelynn:** If it gets us into the vehicle faster, I&#39;ll take your hand.

(//Benson lifts up Evelynn and she leans on him.//)

**Benson:** Woah, slow down there Doc. I don&#39;t exactly feel the same way about you.

**Evelynn:** Your wit knows no end, Agent Benson.

**Benson:** Heh, I do my best.

(//They enter the MRAP Truck and Evelynn shakily sits down next to the rest of the group.//)

**Evelynn:** Ending video log...

**Section 5: Post-Incident Report**





[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Open Document&#34; hide=&#34;- Close Document&#34;]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

Following evacuations and clean-up of Incident 6090-1, survivors were assessed for injuries and debriefed.

**Dr. Atticus Rateleken** exhibited large scratch wounds, which proved to be mostly superficial and required only minimal medical intervention. Regardless, he chose to remain in his Hybrid Form for the duration of a week, in order to &#34;commit it to muscle memory,&#34; and ordered clothes tailored for it. During this time, he and Dr. Antleur collaborated on analyzing the anomalous properties of his venom and its potential to create a cure for SCP-6090, based on its observed effects on Belette Le Fou(ine).

**Dr. Evelynn Antleur** exhibited damage to several ligaments of her left ankle, and was given appropriate treatment. Despite the need for crutches, she insisted on assisting in the development of a potential cure for SCP-6090. Together with Dr. Rateleken, they isolated several specialized anomalous oils, toxins and prions that, in high enough concentrations, specifically target and neutralize SCP-6090 both outside and within human cells, without causing additional harm to the tissue.

Through testing with infected D-Class, this cure was demonstrated to completely eliminate the DNA template overwrites of SCP-6090 and, through means not fully understood, causes any SCP-6090-B instance to rapidly revert back to its original non-anomalous human form. Further testing is still underway for lingering side-effects from this potential cure and after-effects from SCP-6090 infection. Dr. Antleur herself will be part of these tests on a two month long trial uncured and an additional month after being cured.

**Dr. Bardolph Dalton** sustained several bruises and hairline fractures to his ribs, and was treated by Foundation veterinarians. He will be required to remain in Feral Form during recuperation. His communications will be closely monitored by the Foundation for any attempts to contact PoI-6090-4342, Sandra Collins, for a period no less than 15 months, or until the containment of PoI-6090-4342.

**Convoy Security Retinue Guard 05, Agent Terrance Neilson**, sustained several injuries from redirected gunshots, though his armor reduced their severity. He was allowed a week to recuperate before being debriefed. He will be given an additional month to reach full convalescence. He will then be redeployed uncured on a trial basis, to field test the capabilities of Bovine SCP-6090-B Field Agents, for a period of no less than 3 months.

Regarding the **Mabbites**. Regarding the **Mabbites**. Regarding the **Mabbites**. They will henceforth be referred to as **GoI-3903**. This is to prevent the demonstrated Echoing Nomenclative Hazard that is conceptually attached to the group&#39;s name. Little is currently known about GoI-3903, but based on information gathered by the U.I.U., it is currently believed to have formed within the last year, with its membership consisting mainly of Unseelie Fae. Investigations are currently underway with assistance from the U.I.U., who have far more experience in dealing with Fae criminals.[[footnote]]Particularly Fae criminals from amongst Three Portlands&#39; sizeable population of Avalon refugees.[[/footnote]]
