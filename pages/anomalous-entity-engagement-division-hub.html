Hi, my name is [[*user winkwonkboi]]. I&#39;m the one behind the AEED.

Back in March of 2022, I participated in a team-based contest dedicated to develop new and/or underused departments of the Foundation known as DEPARTMENTCON2022. At the time, I left a comment on the forums with a very basic idea of what the division would be.

Then, with the help of my teammates [[*user Deadcanons]] and [[*user GreenGolem]], we managed to pull together a more concrete version of the AEED — the one you see before you. These are their stories.

[[tab So What&#39;s This?]]
The Anomalous Entity Engagement Division (AEED) is a department dedicated to the containment of harmless, mundane, and/or sentient anomalies. Personnel and skips under the purview of the AEED are typically treated with more leniency compared to other compartments due to its unique methodology, being allowed to act less professional on the job and bond with those under confinement without discipline.

It was formed with the intention of humanizing the practices of the Foundation and providing a more safe and healthy environment for anomalies and staff alike. The AEED typically conducts various recreational activities to further engage and interact with the skips under the superficial guise of &#34;increasing compliance.&#34;

Despite its relatively small scope, the AEED is well-established among Foundation personnel, with many viewing the department through a critical lens and expressing their opposition to its unorthodox approach to containment. Even with the AEED&#39;s polarizing views from outside members, the division possesses a number of useful benefits.

Facilities housing the division have displayed a notable improvement in the morale of staff and anomalies. This resulted in a general decrease in breaches and other related incidents as well as better work productivity. Due to the AEED&#39;s positive impact, more and more sites have considered integrating the department into their own network.

Simply put, the AEED serves as an antithesis to the Foundation&#39;s traditional principles.
[[/tab]]
[[tab The Caretakers]]
&#34;Caretaker&#34; is a term coined by the AEED referring to those working for the department. Here are a number of the more notable ones:

[[div class=&#34;table3&#34;]]
[[div class=&#34;tableb&#34;]]
||~ Amelie R. Metanoia ||~ AEED Director ||
|||| Amelie R. Metanoia (she/her) is a French-American researcher for the Foundation. She became the Director of the AEED upon founding the department in 1985. With a background in field research, Amelie has seen first-hand the horrors of the anomalous. She convinced the O5-Council that improving the quality of life and care provided to SCPs would ultimately be to the Foundation&#39;s benefit. Given the state of the AEED, it&#39;s hard to say if she&#39;s been proven right or not. But, for the few staff and SCPs that have benefitted from the AEED, Amelie is like a patron saint. Her friends call her Amy. ||
||~ Kirby Case ||~ Deputy Site Director ||
|||| Kirby Case (they/them) is a former field agent and the Deputy Site Director of Site-169. When they first began working at the site, they disagreed with Dir. Metanoia&#39;s methods and the mission statement of the AEED. Over time, however, they began to see her side of things and learned how to work alongside the SCPs in containment. They are Dir. Metanoia&#39;s fiercest supporter and most loyal ally. ||
||~ Moses Feghoot ||~ Site-169 Director ||
|||| Moses Feghoot (he/him) is the Site Director of Site-169. Chosen by the O5-Council specifically because he disagrees with Dir. Metanoia&#39;s policies, Dir. Feghoot has the ultimate say on anything that happens at Site-169. He runs into conflict with Dir. Case far more often than Dir. Metanoia, who understands his caution and careful thinking. While it is often that Feghoot prevents the AEED from advancing their work, it is equally often that he is the only reason anything gets done at all. ||
||~ Melissa Mayfield ||~ Counselor ||
|||| Melissa Mayfield (she/her) is Site-169&#39;s assigned counselor, though she frequently visits a multitude of other facilities when carrying out her duties. She likes to put as much work on her plate and reach out to many people and anomalies alike, wearing a bright grin as she does so. Despite her cheery and upbeat attitude, Mayfield shows an appreciation for slower moments, sitting back and taking a breather every now and then. She&#39;s willing to stand her ground as she puts her gratitude for the AEED on full display. ||

[[tab How to Contribute]]
You want to write for the AEED? Well, here are some tips:

* Read some of the articles you see above, obviously. Contextualization is key.

* If you&#39;re going to write an article based in Site-169 (aka the &#39;From the Heart&#39; tab), it&#39;s best to read the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-169 associated dossier] if you want to get a feel on how the facility works.

* If you&#39;re //not// writing for Site-169 (aka the &#39;Around the World&#39; tab), then good for you.

* AEED articles tend to be more character-driven, bringing light to the people behind the scenes instead of the work they do. That&#39;s not to say it&#39;s obligatory, only a recommendation.

* That being said, dialogue is a nice and effective way to bring out the more humane aspects of your characters. Know how to write dialogue.

* Make sure to be consistent with the rest of the articles. Nothing wrong with breaking it down every so often but don&#39;t stray too far from what the AEED is supposed to be.

* If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me ([[*user winkwonkboi]]) a message. I&#39;m also willing to give critique, but I&#39;m not that good, trust me.

In terms of tone, the AEED typically consists of slice-of-life stories. Romance and comedy? Awesome. Tragedy and emotional? Sure, why not. Horror and thriller are very iffy considering how wholesome the AEED tends to be, but if you can somehow pull it off, then all the more power to you.

After posting, you can add your article to the appropriate tab above.
[[/tab]]
[[tab Thematic Elements]]
= Here are a number of themes the AEED goes by:

* **For Canonicity&#39;s Sake:** First and foremost, canons. The AEED is free to be used under any canon that fits its motto the best. However, those that don&#39;t mesh well with the division or even contradict its directives are highly ill-advised. If it isn&#39;t heartwarming, comedic, or slice-of-life, chances are it won&#39;t sit well with the AEED.

* **Budget Constraints:** Despite the advantages the department may have, the AEED is still considered a low-priority branch due to their fixation on recreational activities. Their resources are more limited compared to other compartments, with the exception of anomalies requiring a [[[scp-6925|higher budget to handle.]]] While this won&#39;t necessarily affect how you write, it&#39;s worth noting when picturing the AEED&#39;s position.

* **Off the High Horse:** For clarification, the AEED treats anomalies like //people,// not angels. They don&#39;t simply put them on pedestals and act as if they can do no wrong, going along with any request they have no matter how ridiculous. They&#39;re willing to discipline them if ever necessary, like you would with any other person. They&#39;re here to lend a hand, not to fawn on anyone.

* **No Hard Feelings:** While they do have unorthodox ways of confining anomalies, it should be noted that the AEED lacks any ulterior motives. They&#39;re not against the Foundation&#39;s goals or their intentions as an organization, but rather their execution of handling skips. They only exist to promote a more accepting environment, not to go head-to-head with other departments. No grudges, merely disagreements here and there.

* **In the Name of Love:** The staff that comprises the AEED are genuine people who actually care for the anomalies under their wing and are trying to make the best out of not-so-grand circumstances. Again, the division&#39;s main purpose is to humanize the containment process. Both its personnel and anomalies play a role in what makes the AEED what it is: Just some people trying to help.
