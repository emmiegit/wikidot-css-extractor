Hey there, and welcome to my author page! I, Univine, am a Chinese-American computer science/economics major and aspiring software engineer. I have a passion for competing in collegiate quizbowl, which, incidentally, has informed much of what I&#39;ve written for this website. Here&#39;s a listing of all of the articles I&#39;ve written so far, with some personal commentary on each.

**SCPs:**

[[collapsible show=&#34;Show SCPs&#34; hide=&#34;Hide SCPs&#34;]]
* [[[SCP-1445]]] (&#34;An Antique Spacecraft&#34;) - My first article, from just over two years before this author page was created. I don&#39;t particularly remember my thought process behind this article, but I //definitely// remember the nerve-wracking (yet enjoyable) experience of posting my first article. Although this article definitely does not reflect my current philosophy towards and experience with writing SCPs, it still is a good representation of my overall writing style.

* [[[SCP-2515]]] (&#34;//Napoleon Crossing the Urals//&#34;) - Around the time I wrote this article, I had decided to study Jacques-Louis David&#39;s paintings in preparation for quizbowl tournaments. Then, I must have wondered, &#34;What if there was a timeline in which Napoleon invaded (spoiler alert) the Daevite Empire, and David decided to paint it?&#34; The result was this article, in which I attempted to synthesize the site&#39;s Daevite mythos with real-world history and art.

* [[[SCP-2788]]] (&#34;God is --Red-- Rich&#34;) - This article was initially inspired by the biopic //The Last Emperor//, which gave me the idea of a god transforming into a simple citizen over the ages. Initially, I had trouble with developing this idea into an actual article, but my memory of reading about Huaxi Village provided me a setting for this article and the impetus to write it. It was my first attempt at a character-based SCP, but overall I was very happy with the result.
 * Translations: [[image PRoC.png height=&#34;10px&#34; link=&#34;http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-2788&#34;]]
* [[[SCP-2229]]] (&#34;Legate of Ursa Major to the Senate and People of Rome&#34;) - The idea behind this article was one that I had been sitting on for quite a while, since it was intended to be a twist on the conventional idea of ancient aliens. At the same time, I wanted to try my hand at a direct crosslink with another SCP, in this case [[[SCP-1822]]], and based on the combination of these two notions, I wrote this article.

* [[[SCP-2309]]] (&#34;Iron Wall of Dhul-Qarnayn&#34;) - In the month before I wrote this article, I spent quite a bit of time learning about Islamic theology and practices. In doing so, I read the Surat Al-Kahf, a section of the Qur&#39;an describing the construction of an iron wall by Dhul-Qarnayn to contain Yajuj and Majuj (Gog and Magog). Looking into this more, I found descriptions of Yajuj and Majuj that reminded me distinctly of Sarkic creatures, giving me the impetus for this article.

* [[[SCP-2405]]] (&#34;2017_acf_nats_fianls.mp4&#34;) - I&#39;ve wanted to write an SCP about quizbowl for a while, and now I have. If there&#39;s any takeaway from this article, it&#39;s that though every society has a different idea of what knowledge is &#34;useful,&#34; knowing more can never hurt. (With the possible exception of cognitohazards, but that&#39;s neither here nor there...)
* [[[SCP-2903]]] (&#34;Garden of the Manichees&#34;) - I sat on this SCP for quite a while (nearly half a year) before I felt the impetus to complete it and post it. As absurd as its concept might seem at first glance, it is inspired by a real Manichaean belief that the electae could release particles of the Elements of Light by digesting fruits and vegetables.
 * Translations: [[image Japan.png height=&#34;10px&#34; link=&#34;http://ja.scp-wiki.net/scp-2903&#34;]]
* [[[SCP-2566]]] (&#34;Demurrage&#34;) - My aborted SCP-3000 contest entry turned mainlist Series III SCP. On one hand, I&#39;m a bit sad that it wasn&#39;t received very well as a contest entry, but on the other hand, I know that I&#39;m not much of a horror writer in the first place. In the end, it&#39;s probably best for this SCP to be read as a standalone piece and not part of the contest anyways.
* [[[SCP-3777]]] (&#34;Jewish Mekhanite Golem Robot&#34;) - It&#39;s a silly title, but really, I couldn&#39;t resist. This SCP builds on the setting that I had previously established in [[[excerpts-regarding-st-sophia |Excerpts Regarding St. Sophia]]]: 1^^st^^ century Anatolia, where Mekhanites, Christians, Jews, and pagans are vying for religious supremacy.

**GoI Formats:**

* [[[oria-736-009 |MEMORANDUM 009 REGARDING PROJECT 736]]] - My first attempt to branch out from writing in the SCP format on this website. My intent with this article was to update [[[SCP-036]]], a Series I SCP about the Yazidis, with respect to recent atrocities carried out by ISIS against the Yazidis. Overall, I tried to strike a balance between being respectful towards real-world groups and events, and connecting them with groups and events in the SCP universe.

* [[[excerpts-regarding-st-sophia |Excerpts Regarding St. Sophia]]] - It&#39;s always bothered me how the Mekhanites basically disappear from the SCP universe&#39;s timeline following the war with the Sarkic Cults. This tale, which takes the form of supposedly Christian and Mekhanite scriptures, tries to bridge the gap and investigate how a dying mystery cult interacted with what was to be one of the most influential religions ever.

* [[[the-parables-of-pseudo-nadox |The Parables of Pseudo-Nadox]]] - I&#39;ve noticed that there hasn&#39;t been much content that explains Sarkicism from a Sarkic perspective, which inspired me to write this article containing Sarkic parables. While the stories may be somewhat familiar to us, the themes are decided not. I decided to coldpost this particular article because I wanted to try out something new and see how it might be received without having prior feedback.
