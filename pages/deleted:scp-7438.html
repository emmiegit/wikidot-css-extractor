**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP- 7438 is to be kept in a Standard humanoid containment cell decorated as a room at a retirement home, all personnel that interact with SCP-7438 must operate under the cover story that they are it&#39;s caretaker&#39;s at a retirement home where SCP-7438 lives in its old age. the room is to be fitted with soundproofing and cameras, no auditory listening devices should be in SCP-7438&#39;s cell at anytime. 

SCP-7438 may be taken out of containment to aid in the containment of anomalies, before removing SCP-7438 from containment authorization must be given by Dr Gwendoline Mulier [[footnote]] Head of containment for SCP-7438 [[/footnote]] at least 2 members of Site Command. At which time SCP-7438 is to be gagged until at destination.

If SCP-7438 is ever to breach containment, the site is to be put into full lockdown as soon as a breach is established, all audio monitoring equipment is to be disabled until lockdown is lifted. MTF Sigma-62 &#34;Grandkids&#34; is to be send in with noise cancelling headgear to reestablish containment at which time lockdown may be lifted. All breaches are to be reported to Dr Gwendoline Mulier and Site Command.

During all tests with SCP-7438 a advanced text-to-speech bot is to be used with cameras to monitor experiments, as audio recording equipment can not be used. descriptions based on camera footage will be added to the transcripts to better show events in testing. 

**Description:** SCP-7438 appears to be a Caucasian human male seeming to be in its 80s 1.8 meters in height, SCP-7438&#39;s hair is all grey or white, and has a beard 24 center meters long.

SCP- 7438 has the anomalous effect of putting any creature that can understand it to a trance like sleep after speaking to them for at least 280 seconds, in this trance like state the effected creature can remain standing and nothing can wake them, they will remain in this state until SCP-7438 stops talking and for on average 10 minutes after. However, if SCP-7438 remains talking to the effected for more than 30 minutes this effect becomes permeant, resulting in a almost comatose state until death by starvation or dehydration those effected by the stage 2 effect are classified as SCP-7438-1.

SCP-7438 was discovered in [REDACTED] by field agents, after reports of &#34;An old man so boring he was making people fall asleep while standing in the streets&#34; while trying to retrieve SCP-7438 all members of retrieval team Delta 3-A fell victim to the anomaly&#39;s effect thankfully they were able call for back up before falling to the effect, Delta 3-B was sent out with sound cancelling equipment as the call for back up said they were being put to sleep by &#34;it&#39;s stories&#34;. Delta 3-B was able to retrieve the anomaly after that without anymore incidents. all members of Delta 3-A were fine, none of them were effected by the stage 2 effect. All effected civilians that were able to be woken were interviewed and then given Class A amnestics.

**Addendum SCP-7438-1:** During incisal containment we found [REDACTED] instances of SCP-7438-1, I&#39;m requesting the opinion of the Ethics Committee for what to do with them as currently we have them on life support but during testing that number has increased and its becoming a problem having so many of them in the medical ward.  


++ **Notable Testing Logs**

[[collapsible show=&#34;-Show Test Report 7438-01&#34; hide=&#34; &#34;]]
&gt; **Goal:** To get a basic understanding of SCP-7438&#39;s anomalous effects.
&gt;
&gt; **Synopsis** D-6148 was put into the cell with SCP-7438.
&gt;
&gt; **Results** (See transcript 7438-01 for full details) SCP-7438 greeted D-6148 warmly and started asking questions about where it was, D-6148 as instructed ignored its questions and it wasn&#39;t long until it started telling D-6148 a story, and less than a minute later D-6148 fell asleep, he was then pulled out by guards, and woke up approximately 10 minutes later.
&gt;
&gt; **Notes:** SCP-7438 seems to posses the ability to put anyone to sleep with its stories, I recommend testing to be done with animals and to see if we can prolong the effect, if we can it might be possible to use SCP-7438 to help contain and move over Anomalies. It is also notable that it seems to have referred to concentration camps, this could mean it was alive around the time of World World 2. -Dr G. Mulier

&gt; **START OF TRANSCRIPT**
&gt;
&gt; *D-6148 enters the cell*
&gt;
&gt; SCP-7438: &#34;Hello, I&#39;m  Edward, Edward James, what&#39;s your name?
&gt;
&gt; *D-6148 speaks into radio*
&gt;
&gt; D-6148: Do I tell it my name or the number you call me?&#34;
&gt;
&gt; Dr. Mulier: Please use your number D-6148
&gt;
&gt; *D-6148 turns off radio*
&gt;
&gt; D-6148: they call me D-6148
&gt;
&gt; SCP-7438: &#34;That&#39;s a strange name, are you from one of those camps that the German&#39;s run during the war?&#34;
&gt;
&gt; D-6148: &#34;No, I&#39;m not&#34;
&gt;
&gt; SCP-7438: &#34;Oh, well can I ask a question?&#34;
&gt;
&gt; D-6148: &#34;I guess&#34;
&gt;
&gt; SCP-7438: Where am I?
&gt;
&gt; D-6148: &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34;
&gt;
&gt; SCP-7438: &#34;I see, you know this reminds me of a story, I had a friend, Arthur he was always getting lost. I remember he once got lost at sea, you see Arthur had a boat you see, he once went out and a couple days later his wife, Mabel, she told us he never came home...&#34;
&gt;
&gt; *D-6148 becomes unresponsive*
&gt;
&gt; *guards remove D-6148 from the cell*

[[collapsible show=&#34;-Show Test Report 7438-02&#34; hide=&#34; &#34;]]
&gt; **Goal:** To see if SCP-7438 has any anomalous effect on various animals.
&gt;
&gt; **Synopsis:** A Golden Retriever, Persian cat and Grey Domestic Mouse were put into SCP-7438&#39;s cell.
&gt;
&gt; **Results:** SCP-7438 was surprised to see so many animals in its cell, it started telling a story about a friend of his named Jack who tried to recreate Noah&#39;s ark. about 30 seconds in the dog falls asleep, after 5 minutes nothing else happens, the animals were removed, the dog woke up 10 minutes later.
&gt;
&gt; **Notes:** Studies show that dog&#39;s can understand humans, however the over two animals could not, this means, you likely have to understand SCP-7438 for the effect to take place, this would mean that it could not be used to help contain more animalistic anomalies, but it would still be useful for more intelligent anomalies. - Dr G. Mulier
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;-Show Test Report 7438-03&#34; hide=&#34; &#34;]]
&gt; **Goal:** To gain more information on SCP-7438.
&gt;
&gt; **Synopsis:** Dr Mulier, entered the cell to interview SCP-7438, she would make sure to try and avoid letting SCP-7438 tell stories, if she fell asleep she was to be pulled out immediately. 
&gt;
&gt; **Results:** (See Transcript 7438-03).
&gt;
&gt; **Notes:** This does prove the theory that it must be telling a story for the effect to happen, but we didn&#39;t get much else. SCP-7438 shows clear distress at its current situation, I recommend the uses of class C amnestics to wipe memory of all events since containment and the uses of the cover story I purposed. -Dr G. Mulier

&gt; *Dr Mulier walks into the cell*
&gt;
&gt; SCP-7438: &#34;Hi there do you know where I am?&#34;
&gt;
&gt; Dr. Mulier: &#34;I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t tell you that&#34;
&gt;
&gt; SCP-7438: &#34;Where are my manners? I&#39;m Edward&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Mulier: &#34;I&#39;m Dr. Mulier&#34;
&gt;
&gt; SCP-7438: &#34;Your a Doctor? Am I at the hospital?&#34;
&gt;
&gt; Dr. Mulier: &#34;I&#39;m really sorry, we just can&#39;t tell you.&#34;
&gt;
&gt; *SCP-7438 becomes destressed*
&gt;
&gt; SCP-7438: &#34;Did I do something wrong? is that why I&#39;m here.&#34;
&gt;
&gt; Dr. Mulier: &#34;I&#39;m so so sorry, but we can&#39;t tell you, not now. I have some questions, if you don&#39;t mind.&#34;
&gt;
&gt; SCP-7438: &#34;Ok, what do you want to know?&#34;
&gt;
&gt; Dr. Mulier: &#34;Do you notice that people tend to fall asleep when talking to you?&#34;
&gt;
&gt; SCP-7438: &#34;Only well I&#39;m telling stories, I guess they just must be boring, or maybe people like my voice.&#34;
&gt;
&gt; Dr. Mulier: &#34;Has that always been the case?&#34;
&gt;
&gt; SCP-7438: &#34;No not always, I can&#39;t remember when it started, but I think it was after I retired.&#34;
&gt;
&gt; Dr. Mulier: &#34;What happened that day, the day you were brought here I mean&#34;
&gt;
&gt; SCP-7438: &#34;I was being interviewed for some TV show, I was telling a story and kind of got lost in it. when I finished being spaced out I was being put into some sort of armored van.
&gt;
&gt; Dr. Mulier: I see, well thank you Edward, I think we may be talking again soon, I&#39;ll see what I can do with changing the information we can give you.
&gt;
&gt; SCP-7438: &#34;Thank you Doctor&#34;

[[collapsible show=&#34;-Show Test Report 7438-04&#34; hide=&#34; &#34;]]
&gt; **Goal:** To test SCP-7438&#39;s effects in detail
&gt;
&gt; **Synopsis:** 1 D-Class was put in and left with SCP-7438 for half an hour, then removed. Second D-Class was left with SCP-7438 for 25 minutes. Final D-Class was left with SCP-7438 for 20 minutes, removed, then brought back after 5 minutes, this was repeated twice more.
&gt;
&gt; **Results:** First D-Class was declared an SCP-7438-1. Second D-Class woke up 10 minutes later. Final D-Class woke up 10 minutes after final exposer ended.
&gt;
&gt; **Notes:** These test show promising results in regards to being able to help contain anomalies. I request permission to do a cross test with another anomaly. - Dr G. Mulier
&gt;
&gt; **Request was approved.**
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;-Show Test Report 7438-05&#34; hide=&#34; &#34;]]
&gt; **Goal:** To see if SCP-7438 can put another anomaly to sleep
&gt;
&gt; **Synopsis:** SCP-049 was informed it could have a human subject on the condition that it listened to the man&#39;s story first, if SCP-7438 failed to put SCP-049 to sleep with in 5 minutes it was to be immediately removed, multiple MTF squads were on stand by incase SCP-049 attempted to breach containment.
&gt;
&gt; **Results:** After less than a minute SCP-7438 was able to put SCP-049 to sleep. 
&gt;
&gt; **Notes:** SCP-7438&#39;s anomalous effect has proven it can be used to sedate other anomalies. I request it be changed from Euclid to Esoteric, Thaumiel. I also request authorization for more cross testing. - Dr G. Mulier
&gt;
&gt; **Request 1 was approved**
