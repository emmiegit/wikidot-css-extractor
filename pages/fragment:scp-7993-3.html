**Special Containment Procedures:** Radio and television broadcasts across North America are monitored regularly by the Telecommunications Department, headquartered in Site-84 ##blue|, under the supervision of PENTAGRAM.## All reports of SCP-7993 are to be forwarded to PENTAGRAM, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri. ##blue|Unauthorized personnel that view or listen to an SCP-7993 or SCP-7993-B instance shall be detained at any available site and transferred into United States custody as soon as possible.##

##blue|Due to SCP-7993&#39;s geographically wide range of activity and the rapid propagation of SCP-7993-B instances, the Foundation has formed an agreement with the United States&#39; PENTAGRAM to attempt to neutralize SCP-7993, as well as all other anomalies identified as a direct risk to normalcy, as [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wjs-proposal mutually agreed upon by the O5 Council ].##

##blue|Containment Zones are populated areas of Earth that have been cleared of any SCP-7993-related phenomenon. Containment Zones are established by the successful implementation of Procedure-7993-Delta. Any individuals outside of these Containment Zones are to be treated as a potential SCP-7993-A instance, and personnel are to react accordingly. All SCP-7993-B instances must be neutralized upon recovery.##

**Description:** SCP-7993 is an anomalous radio broadcast emitting from the current center of population in the United States[[footnote]] Currently, Jefferson County, Missouri [[/footnote]]. SCP-7993 possesses the ability to hijack radio and television receivers. SCP-7993 tends to hijack receivers that were previously relaying media related to or covering discussions about the United States. ##blue|SCP-7993 is highly active, broadcasting approximately every two weeks.## Individuals targeted by SCP-7993 have no common traits other than being citizens of North America. 

All individuals are susceptible to SCP-7993&#39;s anomalous effects, regardless of cognitohazard resistance. SCP-7993-A is the designation given to any individual under the influence of an SCP-7993 broadcast. SCP-7993-A instances maintain an anti-war, anti-militarization stance ##blue|specifically against the United States,## regardless of prior opinions. ##blue|SCP-7993-A instances dedicate the majority of their time to protesting or protesting-related activities. Protests by SCP-7993-A instances are often direct, targeting government installations and personnel. SCP-7993-A instances are hostile in their protests, often resorting to terror tactics such as kidnapping, bomb threats, murder, chemical warfare, and other destructive actions.##

##blue|SCP-7993-B is the designation given to media created by SCP-7993-A instances. SCP-7993-B carries the same cognitohazard effects as SCP-7993, causing subjects that observe an SCP-7993-B instance to react similarly, becoming an additional SCP-7993-A instance. SCP-7993-A instances are anomalously driven to create SCP-7993-B instances.##

SCP-7993 ##blue|and SCP-7993-B&#39;s## contents are often outlandish, frequently featuring both urban and non-urban combat footage,[[footnote]] No footage has been linked to any real-world events, as is the case with the majority of SCP-7993 broadcast footage[[/footnote]] recordings of nuclear weapon tests, audio of incoherent speeches, and unidentified symbols[[footnote]] To date, June 29th, 1971, no symbol has shown any anomalous properties outside of their original SCP-7993 broadcast [[/footnote]].

**Discovery:** SCP-7993 was discovered on December 12th, 1949 when reports of unusual protests near White Sands Proving Ground [[footnote]] A USAAF Atomic Bomb testing ground[[/footnote]], New Mexico. It was later discovered that between the times of 1630 and 1730, all thirteen SCP-7993-A individuals involved were driving to their residences after work[[footnote]] All thirteen instances worked various civilian jobs on the base [[/footnote]] and were all listening to their car radios before they all were subject to an SCP-7993 broadcast. However, due to the spontaneous nature of SCP-7993 and the technical limitations of the dispatching field office, only one interview was recorded on tape.

**Addendum:**

**Addendum.b|Interview-7993|12/12/1949-Closing Statement:** On October 27th, 1967, all thirteen individuals involved in this incident began to protest more in line with recent SCP-7993-A instances, featuring a more direct and hostile approach. As such, all thirteen individuals have since been detained by PENTAGRAM officials.

**Post-Incident Investigation:** NB1971

**Date:** June 29th, 1971

**Investigation party:** Federal Bureau Of Investigation Unusual Incident Unit

**Reason(s):** Explain the increase in activity from SCP-7993.

**Foreword:** On October 27th, 1967, the then O5 Council ordered the enactment of Project Protector, which disabled all nuclear warheads via anomalous means. However, this was not done in time to prevent several nuclear strikes on the United States, leading to the destruction of major portions of the United States East Coast and the deaths of approximately ninety million citizens. The following war, documented as the American-Eurasian War, led to the unfortunate discovery that for an unknown amount of time, SCP-7993was highly active and able to reach overseas, leading to several NATO nations coming under the majority influence of SCP-7993. 

This was experienced firsthand when several former allies of the United States turned against it. NATO unanimously, with the exception of the United States, //protested// the war, which was done conventionally against the USSR initially but eventually, by late 1968, involved the CCP and their mutual allies. By 1970 talks of dissolving NATO and the United Nations began, likely due to widespread SCP-7993-A instances throughout the world influencing opinions. To prevent such an outcome, the United States launched a peacekeeping operation in an attempt to clear the world of SCP-7993-A influence. This eventually led to the establishment of Containment Zones, areas with enough media control to prevent SCP-7993 or SCP-7993-B interception.

In January 1971, order within NATO and the United Nations was restored, and it was determined that the only way to combat SCP-7993 was strict control of all media. Thankfully, technology and methods derived from the Foundation provided an effective way to carry out this mission. Specifically with the development of Agent-7993. Further explanation of Agent-7993 requires a higher security clearance than required to read this document. As such, Agent-7993 is not discussed in detail.

**Result:** Increase in SCP-7993 activity connected to October 27th, 1967 Incident.
