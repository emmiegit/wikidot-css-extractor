**Special Containment Procedures:** A 2km area surrounding SCP-4003 and Provisional Site-1200 has been designated a protected area. Civilians entering the perimeter are to be intercepted and turned away. Only personnel specializing in archeology, paleontology, and geology may be assigned to Provisional Site-1200.

All extracted artifacts and fossils recovered from SCP-4003 are to be stored in Site-11&#39;s Intensive Care Item Storage after being cataloged. Excess fossils deemed to be non-anomalous may be donated to the Museum of the Rockies via a Foundation front organization, the Southern Canadian Paleontologist group. 

Any mentions of the town of Temperance found in historical documents and period journals are to be expunged. 

**Description:** SCP-4003 is the group designation for the archaeological remains of the town of Temperance and its citizens found in the Hell Creek Formation near Jordan, Montana. Fossils, objects, and remains found within SCP-4003 date to the upper Cretaceous era[[footnote]]Due to the roughly similar location of discovery and dated time of origin, investigation of a connection between SCP-4003 and [[[SCP-3834]]] is underway.[[/footnote]].

The town&#39;s few buildings included a saloon, sheriff&#39;s office, trading post, general store, and domestic buildings along its main street. Temperance primarily served as a rest stop for caravans heading to Helena from the Minnesota territory and had a small permanent population. The calculated population is estimated to have been 40 civilians and 10 horses and other livestock. Though little information on the town is available, it is mentioned in the journals of Gold Rush settlers between 1859 and 1866. Though the exact date of the town&#39;s disappearance is currently unknown, it is believed to have vanished in November of 1866.

[[include component:image-block name=Temperance.jpg|caption=Temperance&#39;s Main Street, circa 1866.|width=300px]]
Following its disappearance, Temperance and its population manifested in the late Cretaceous era about 66 million years ago. It is believed most, if not all of the inhabitants and livestock perished from oxygen poisoning due to the increased levels of the chemical compound present in the Earth&#39;s atmosphere at the time. Any survivors were then likely to have perished from exposure, disease, famine, and the predatory megafauna. 

The town of Temperance reappeared in its exact geographical location in the Upper Cretaceous Period. The lithology of SCP-4003 and the surrounding area indicate the climate of the area was subtropical due to its proximity to the Western Interior Seaway; sharply contrasting the aridity of modern Montana. 

Below are brief lists of fossils and artifacts found in SCP-4003.[[footnote]] [[[SCP-4041|No recovered Dinosauria fossils have been noted to be feathered.]]] [[/footnote]]

SCP-4003 was discovered in 1871 by gold miners from the nearby Everwood Mine. Foundation field operatives were dispatched to the dig site to evaluate the reports of human remains being found deep underground in newly created tunnels. Though originally believed to be //Homo neanderthalensis// specimens, the anatomy of the found skulls were identical to that of a //Homo sapiens//. Level II Hypnosuggestive agents [[footnote]] Prior to the discovery and widespread use of amnestics, the Foundation utilized Hypnosuggestive agents to induce amnesia and maintain secrecy. Though very powerful, the drug often had nearly fatal side effects. Use of Hypnosuggestive agents was discontinued in 1958. [[/footnote]] were administered to all involved civilians and the Foundation purchased ownership of Everwood Mine. Provisional Site-1200 was established near SCP-4003 shortly afterward, and the area of discovery was excavated.

An investigation by the [[[SCP-3797|Department of Temporal Anomalies]]] is currently ongoing, as is archeological and paleontological work on SCP-4003.


**Addendum 1: Recovered Journals**
On 07/26/2008, a metal safe found to be in good condition was recovered from SCP-4003. Its contents are anomalously well-preserved and show no signs of aging. Items found in the safe include musket balls, revolver rounds, a rosary, daguerreotypes, and a journal. The journal is labeled as belonging to one &#39;Pendleton Tweed&#39;; a sheriff&#39;s deputy in Temperance.

A collection of entries following Temperance&#39;s disappearance is available below. 

**Note:** The presented entries have been revised and edited to be easily legible by modern standards.

A giant monster like I never seen before came in, makin&#39; the whole town shake with its footsteps. It was bigger than any building I seen before, and it walked right up to the pile of demons and started eatin&#39; &#39;em. Father Jacob and a few others came scramblin&#39; out of the church tryin&#39; to excorcise it, but it ate him. Was the scariest thing; one second he was there shoutin&#39; &#39;bout Christ and then all we was hearin&#39; was the rain.

Then it roared the worst sound I ever heard; somethin&#39; fittin the demon it was. The townsfolk tried shootin&#39; at it but the damn thing didn&#39;t even care. Just made it angrier. All I could do was sit there an watch while Sheriff Boone ran out and grab some dynamite. The monster was fixin&#39; to kill the townsfolk but Sheriff Boone caught its attention. Blew the damn thing&#39;s head clean off, and himself too. The rain got worse before we could even try and move the demon away.

I made everyone go home after that. Ain&#39;t no sense in bein&#39; outside near all them bodies if it&#39;s gonna make more of &#39;em come.

I don&#39;t reckon I know what to pray for no more.

I saw God last night. 
@@ @@
I saw His light in the sky, shinin&#39; so bright next to the moon. It was beautiful. I begged Him for forgiveness, I begged Him to learn what I did wrong. But God ain&#39;t answerin&#39; me.

I been begging God for the rain to stop, for forgiveness, and clarity. I see Him in the sky in the day now too. He&#39;s so bright behind these clouds, I can feel His touch.

But God ain&#39;t happy with me. I know my punishment is comin&#39;, and God almighty himself is deliverin&#39; it.

One last time I will pray for forgiveness tonight.
