&gt; //Why bother?//
&gt; 
&gt; -----
&gt; 
&gt; Let&#39;s say the Scarlet King awakens. Let&#39;s say he eats 4,000 sacrificial virgins for breakfast. 
&gt; 
&gt; Halfway through #2,374, he remembers a particularly funny knock-knock joke.
&gt; 
&gt; He laughs, he chokes, and none of his slaves know CPR.
&gt; 
&gt; -----
&gt; 
&gt; Let&#39;s say the flesh god and the machine god decide to settle their differences once and for all. Let&#39;s say they bring every Sarkic cultist and Broken-God-fearing soldier to the final battle.
&gt; 
&gt; The battlefield is on the other side of a wormhole, which closes and never opens again.
&gt; 
&gt; Only catch, we never know who wins. But we can live with that.
&gt; 
&gt; -----
&gt; 
&gt; Let&#39;s say we find an infinitely huge wall of drawers. 
&gt; 
&gt; Let&#39;s say we fill them up with every anomalous item, where they&#39;ll be perfectly content until the heat death of the Universe.
&gt; 
&gt; //And let&#39;s say we still die screaming.//

&gt; 
&gt; May 12th, 2016. One of my few days off in spring. I drank milk straight from the jug without looking at the expiration date - it should have been spoiled for two days. It wasn&#39;t. Still fresh. 
&gt; 
&gt; 8:00 AM, Penny Naismith was off to school, and Mrs. Rosa Naismith told me that she had to go to a parent-teacher conference for Penny later.
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;I&#39;ll go,&#34; I said.
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Don&#39;t,&#34; she said. &#34;It&#39;s your day off.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Last week, I saw a D-class eaten alive by a snake made of intrusive thoughts. I think I can deal with bitchy teachers.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Rosa grimaced, skeptical. //It&#39;s Mr. Glassman, isn&#39;t it,// I thought, starting to miss the Mind Viper.
&gt; 
&gt; 9:00 AM. I sip a mimosa. There&#39;s a classic Doctor Who marathon on PBS. Old Tom Bakers. Rosa catches me grinning ear-to-ear as the title theme comes on. She laughs. 
&gt; 
&gt; 3:00 PM. Mr. Glassman, assistant principal, told me that my daughter &#34;doesn&#39;t handle bullies well.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; I said, &#34;then how about we do something about the kids trying to provoke her?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; He said, &#34;look, when she&#39;s older, you won&#39;t be there to force her to toughen up. Do you want to coddle your daughter all your life, or let her build character?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Half an hour of smiling and nodding later, I took a photo out of my wallet. Said it was of Penny at her baptism. 
&gt; 
&gt; The photo was a of NARCISSUS-class visual cognitohazard that had just been decommissioned. Seeing the foam come from his mouth was one of the finer points of my life as a father, and well worth the reprimand from the O5 council.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Glassman&#39;s still healthy, of course. Only difference is, he believes that if Penny ever cries, a seven-foot-tall eel-man lurking outside his peripheral vision will eat his eyeballs. 
&gt; 
&gt; 6:00 PM. Penny and I watched a movie that introduced her to swear words. She laughed hard enough to start wheezing. 
&gt; 
&gt; 8:00 PM. Penny&#39;s in bed early, contented. 
&gt; 
&gt; 8:30 PM. Pretty sure I can&#39;t go into detail on a Foundation email server, but Rosa&#39;s still got it after ten years. My pelvis still hurts thinking about it. God Bless America.
&gt; 
&gt; -----
&gt; 
&gt; You want happy endings?
&gt; 
&gt; Fuck you.
&gt; 
&gt; You want sad endings?
&gt; 
&gt; Again, fuck you.
&gt; 
&gt; There are only endings. If 15 years of service to a shadow fascist organization bent on locking up all our demons in boxes has taught me anything, it&#39;s that &#34;good&#34; and &#34;bad&#34; are completely subjective. One man&#39;s ZK-class reality failure is another man&#39;s orgasm.
&gt; 
&gt; -----
&gt; 
&gt; So.
&gt; 
&gt; //Why bother?//
&gt; 
&gt; -----
&gt; 
&gt; Because sometimes, temporarily, everything goes right.
&gt; 
&gt; Whatever your situation, however bad things get - As long as you&#39;re alive, there can always be a great day.
&gt; 
&gt; -----
&gt; 
&gt; You got this, Lisle. You&#39;re making Penny and Rosa proud, and Dr. Henderson too, wherever he is.
&gt;  
&gt; Don&#39;t let the nihilists and quitters seduce you. There will be more May 12th, 2016&#39;s if you can keep the bastards locked up.
&gt; 
&gt; And if you can help it, don&#39;t detonate the on-site nuke until you&#39;ve finished the Tom Baker episodes.
&gt; 
&gt; Love,
&gt; Dr. Lisle Naismith
&gt; Site Director, Foundation Site-59
