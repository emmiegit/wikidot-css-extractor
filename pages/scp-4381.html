**Special Containment Procedures:** Given that at least ██,███,███ instances have been documented throughout the world, containment of SCP-4381 is unfeasible. 

Mobile Task Force Omicron-19 (&#34;Pork Grinders&#34;) is to capture and extract SCP-4381 instances in sparsely populated areas as deemed necessary by the Site-166 Research Department. Amnestic aerosols are to be deployed immediately after retrieval. Captured SCP-4381 instances are to be contained in the Fauna Containment Wing at Site-166.

Until the nature of SCP-4381 is determined, research and experimentation with captive SCP-4381 instances is a priority and should remain ongoing. Personnel assigned to interact with SCP-4381 specimens must be aware of their anomalous nature. Expired SCP-4381 instances are to be incinerated and disposed of accordingly.

**Description:** SCP-4381 are domestic pigs (//Sus scrofa domesticus//) that exhibit the behavior and characteristics of humans. However, this only takes effect when the interacting human has no prior knowledge regarding this anomalous property. Anatomical analysis of SCP-4381 instances shows no unusual properties which could be considered the cause of these characteristics.

While digital images of SCP-4381 seem to mitigate this property, audio recordings have been confirmed to retain human vocalizations emitted by SCP-4381 instances.

**Addendum:** Initial Testing Logs

&gt; **Subject:** SCP-4381-1 (Deceased specimen)
&gt; **Procedure:** Abdominal dissection.
&gt; **Results:** Digestive, circulatory, and all other internal organs were physiologically similar to non-anomalous specimens.
&gt; 
&gt; {{EXTRANEOUS LOGS OMITTED}}
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** SCP-4381-8 (Live specimen)
&gt; **Procedure:** Veterinary orthopedic surgery. Subject sedated.
&gt; **Results:** Extracted bones appear to be identical to human bones.
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** SCP-4381-9 (Live Specimen)
&gt; **Procedure:** Tail removal. Mild sedative applied.
&gt; **Results:** Subject emits human screams. Removed tail resembles the gluteal sulcus muscle found in humans. Further analysis indicates physiological similarities with tails of non-anomalous pigs.

**Addendum:** Audio Log 4381-12 Excerpt

&gt; **&lt;Begin Log 4381-04302019&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; //The following test was conducted to determine the scope of SCP-4381. Previous log entries have been removed for brevity. D-7661 was not informed about the subject&#39;s anomalous properties.//
&gt; 
&gt; {{EXTRANEOUS LOGS OMITTED}}
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7661:** So, why are you here, again?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4381-88:** Well, ask them. They think I&#39;m a pig.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7661:** That&#39;s messed up.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4381-88:** Yeah. The more I explain that I&#39;m not... The more they just seem disturbed.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4381-88:** I just want to go home, man. I don&#39;t want to end up like the others.
&gt; 
&gt; {{EXTRANEOUS LOGS OMITTED}}
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** //Three days later, ██ SCP-4381 instances were reported to have manifested in the D-Class Wing.//

**Addendum:** Incident Log 4381-05112019

&gt; █,███ instances were successfully contained by Site-166 personnel after a raid from a meat-processing facility in [REDACTED]. Confiscated records indicate that at least ██,███ instances have been processed as sausages and bacon for the last four years. 
&gt; 
&gt; Several days after the raid, ███ undocumented SCP-4381 instances were reported to have manifested at Site-166. ██ instances that were recently contained and ███ containment personnel were also reported to be missing. A containment breach was subsequently declared and a nearby Foundation facility, Site-235, was notified to deploy personnel to contain the breach.

**Addendum:** Note from Site-235 Director ██████ ██████

&gt; //It appears Site-166 was already been compromised by SCP-4381 for at least 19 months before the breach. All Foundation personnel who have interacted with SCP-4381 were missing.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Until the nature and scope of SCP-4381 are verified, all surviving Site-166 personnel are to undergo Metanoic screening for a duration of 15 days and be administered with Class-D amnestics. Site-235 staff assigned to interact with Site-166 personnel must not be aware of SCP-4381 nor its anomalous properties. Deceased Site-166 personnel and other unidentified individuals found within Site-166 testing facilities are to be incinerated and disposed of according to the Apeiron Protocol.//
&gt; 
&gt; //All digital records of Site-166 personnel are to be deleted from the Foundation database.//
&gt; 
&gt; //A revision of this documentation is to be issued within three weeks.//
