**Item #:** SCP-7065

**Object Class:** --Keter-- --Euclid-- Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7065-1 is to be kept inside of an indoor garden at all available times to ensure the confinement of SCP-7065-2, so it can be studied by Foundation staff. If no garden is available, SCP-7065-1 may be transported to the break room.

**Description:** SCP-7065-1 is a green metal bench with a wire mesh on the back seat. The bench on its own is almost completely identical to a normal bench. The one anomalous quality it does have is emitting a scent resembling //Cinnamomum verum// (cinnamon) and //Syzygium aromaticum// (clove). SCP-7065-2 is a non-hostile humanoid that is composed of a black/grey gas standing at a height of about 2 meters. SCP-7065-2 has  luminescent white eyes that, if direct eye contact is made, cause the brain of any human to release the following chemicals:
* Dopamine
* Serotonin
* Norepinephrine

**Discovery:** SCP-7065 was first discovered in a rural town in **[REDACTED]**, Ohio. Residents reported seeing a &#39;shadow man&#39; stalking joggers. The residents who reported seeing the &#39;shadow man&#39; during the first three weeks had seen SCP-7065-2 in an active state, and called local police. One man by the name of Brent C**[DATA EXPUNGED]** was brought in for questioning by a Foundation doctor, who&#39;s name will **not** be given.

&gt; **Interviewed:** [Brent]
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** [Dr. J████ P█████]
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** [An interview between a paranoid resident of **[REDACTED]**, Ohio]
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log, [1:55 PM]&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. J████ P█████:** [Do you mind if this conversation is recorded?]
&gt; 
&gt; **Brent:** [No, no, not at all. Something has to be done about that damn shadow man.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. J████ P█████:** [If I may ask, what are your worries about the &#39;shadow man&#39; you&#39;re referring to?]
&gt; 
&gt; **Brent:** [I&#39;m just worried about it taking some poor m**[REDACTED FOR EXPLICIT LANGUAGE]**&#39;s kid. My son goes to that park all the damn time!]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. J████ P█████:** [I see.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Brent:** [Though one thing always seems to bring it to tha-that one bench by the main road. That bench that smells like apple pie.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. J████ P█████:** [Have you seen it harm anybody?]
&gt; 
&gt; **Brent:** [No...not yet at least. But my best interests is you take that bench away.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. J████ P█████:** [So you&#39;re proposing, if we get rid the bench, we get rid of the &#39;shadow man&#39;?]
&gt; 
&gt; **Brent:** [Bingo was his name-o.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. J████ P█████:** [Thank you for your time, we&#39;ll take care of your...&#39;shadow man&#39;.]
&gt;  
&gt; **&lt;End Log, [2:10 PM]&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** [The bench, now designated as SCP-7065-1, was taken into Foundation custody, and a replacement was installed the next day. SCP-7065-1 was given the designation of Keter at the time]

**Test Logs 1-6:** After being removed from the park, SCP-7065-1 showed no anomalous behavior, only emitting the scent it was described as having. Before SCP-7065 was to be given a Neutralized class, six tests were preformed on it across eight days.

[[/cell]]
[[cell style=&#34;border: 1px solid silver&#34;]]
The journal given to the D-Class was filled with meditative phrases, breathing exercises, and a video link, which when searched up, led to a 3 and a half hour long video that played relaxing music. SCP-7065 is redesignated to Euclid.
