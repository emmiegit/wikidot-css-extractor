You find your seat at your brand new desk. It&#39;s small, but that fresh scent of a new office fills you with a certain sense of pride. You log onto your desktop and open your email. Sure enough, the message you were expecting to see is waiting right there.

Good afternoon!

It is with great pride that I welcome you to the Site-58 family! We are thrilled to have you here with us. I&#39;ll meet with you soon to discuss the specifics of your position within the facility. For now, I&#39;ve assigned Rosetta.aic to help you with some basics regarding the site itself. Please direct all of your questions to her for the time being.

**Site Function:** Diplomatic containment and communication with sapient anomalous entities.

So! We just kinda throw words at you. Basically, Site-58 is the place all the anomalies capable of thinking and communicating //politely// go. Doesn&#39;t matter how outwardly horrifying or gross they are. If they&#39;re open to diplomatic communication, they come to Site-58!

Now I&#39;m sure you&#39;re thinking &#34;Screamy! You&#39;re so brilliant and smart, can you tell me why we&#39;re dumping all these guys in one spot?&#34; Well first, thank you I know I am. Second! Site-58 is the home of the Department of Anomalous Ambassadorship. They&#39;re a group of trained agents and researchers hand picked for their skills in diplomatic communication. The idea is that since these anomalies are willing to work with us, or at the very least //talk// to us, we&#39;ve got a group willing to work and talk with them in return. Clever, huh?

So I&#39;ll be honest with you, since you&#39;re on our team now. This isn&#39;t all just done out of the kindness of their hearts. Our goal at 58 is, at the end of the day, to cut containment costs where possible. Anomalies that are kept happy (within reason!) are less likely to breach containment. That means less money spent on cleaning up damages.

We&#39;ve been working pretty hard with the Integration Committee as well. I think, and don&#39;t quote me on this, the end goal here is to start pulling the veil back a bit and integrate lower risk anomalies back into the world at large. Truly a noble endeavor! I&#39;ve looked into the future on this, but I&#39;m not totally sure when it&#39;ll happen. But! BUT! That doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t worth doing!

Anyway, that integration effort thing is part of why Site-58 is partially open to the public. You heard that right! As you can see above, Site-58 has a public psychiatry and therapy practice. Citizens of dear Nanticoke actively receive mental health care from the same people who deal with eldritch horrors in our basement! I&#39;m sure that doesn&#39;t have any adverse effects on anyone!

See, the Foundation is nothing if not pragmatic. Over time you realize that sometimes the best way to keep something in a box is to make that box comfortable for them. Best way to make that box comfortable is to talk to the thing you want to put in it. That&#39;s the gist here, these ambassadors talk to anomalies or those involved in the anomalous to make containment as easy as possible for the Foundation as a whole.

------

Site-58 was initially chartered on June 12th, 1990, in response to a notable uptick in contained humanoid anomalies from around the world, with a notable amount originating from what would eventually become known as the Dreamscape. The site&#39;s development and mission statement became the pet project of [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6404 Talla████ ██████], otherwise recognized as O5-5. Nanticoke, Pennsylvania was chosen due to the town&#39;s existing familiarity with the anomalouse, with a myriad of local myths and legends permeating public consciousness. This general pre-existing awareness of the anomalous would make disinformation campaigns in the event of a breach easier to perform.

On August 31st, 1990, several low-risk humanoid and zoological anomalies were formally transferred to Site-58&#39;s custody. Site-58 began its work in earnest, though at this point it was more in line with traditional Foundation modus operandi at this point. While 58 was notably easier on contained anomalies, it still more closely resembled a prison than thee site we see today.

On September 17th, 2006, the site saw a large-scale containment breach. While there were minimal fatalities, the breach did result in a partial veil lift for the town of Nanticoke. Then director O5-5 was forced to re-evaluate the site&#39;s primary goals, which set the Foundations for the Site-58 we see today. Two new directives were established-

1. Site-58 would aim for as humane of a treatment of contained anomalies as possible, communicating with them directly to see to it that their needs are met within reason.

2. Part of Site-58 would become publicly accessible in an effort to eventually eliminate the need to contain low-risk anomalies at all.

3. Site-58 would be the point of relation and diplomacy between the Foundation and diefic anomalies originating from the Dreamscape.

While actively reducing security efforts were seen as insane by the majority of Foundation personnel, a test run of these new initiatives proved successful. Since these initiatives began, Site-58 has seen exactly three containment breaches in total, all related to zoological anomalies. The team that formed to communicate with anomalies to determine their individual needs would eventually go on to become the Department of Anomalous Ambassadors on January 1st, 2012.

Following the untimely death of O5-5 on October 4th, 2007, a new Site Director was assigned. Dir. Scarborough would continue with O5-5&#39;s initial vision for Site-58, and went forth to also establish the remaining departments we have in our modern day. He also started the Foundation Diversity Initiative, an initiative that specifically seeks out employees from minority and marginalized backgrounds in order to encourage a diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and lived experiences on site. Pretty cool, huh?
