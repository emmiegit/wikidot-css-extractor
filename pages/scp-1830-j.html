**Item #:** SCP-1830-J

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment of SCP-1830-J is easier said than done, as our current abilities just don&#39;t cut the mustard. It goes without saying that the Foundation must search high and low for any documents affected by SCP-1830-J and end them once and for all, or it&#39;s only a matter of time before it&#39;s curtains for us.

All persons affected by SCP-1830-J must be terminated with extreme prejudice, time being of the essence. This is a tried and true method of putting a stop to it. The Foundation previously took a stab at amnestic administration in earlier days, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Staff interacting with SCP-1830-J victims should wear hearing protection, as an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. 

**Description:** For all intents and purposes, SCP-1830-J is an anomaly affecting individuals which causes them to use over-the-top, clichéd turns of phrase in written documents, as well as perceiving other documents to be under the thumb of SCP-1830-J. In this day and age, it is estimated that ██% of the world&#39;s population is affected by SCP-1830-J (more or less), but these could be just the tip of the iceberg.

SCP-1830-J is able to spread like wildfire and should be avoided like the plague. Attempting to convince victims they are affected by SCP-1830-J is like talking to a brick wall, as they believe SCP-1830-J is the best thing since sliced bread. Administering standard intelligence tests suggests they are a few sandwiches short of a picnic. Communication with victims also runs the risk of spreading SCP-1830-J, as when you gaze into the abyss, the abyss also gazes into you. 

To the best of our knowledge, the origin of SCP-1830-J was mid-19th century England, where the turn of phrase &#34;██ ███ █ ████ ███ ██████ █████&#34; may be where it all began, although that could be just a shot in the dark.

If SCP-1830-J is allowed to run rampant, it&#39;s plain as day that this would cause literature as an art form to bite the dust; while there&#39;s no accounting for taste, works affected by SCP-1830-J are a far cry from readable. While the Foundation must count its blessings that no mass outbreak of SCP-1830-J has occurred, this may just be the calm before the storm. 

**Addendum:** //It looks like we&#39;ve had the wool pulled over our eyes; SCP-1830-J was right under our noses the whole time. I propose we lock this article once and for all, so it won&#39;t cause anyone else to trip up. All&#39;s well that ends well!//

//It&#39;s a good thing the rest of the database is safe as houses.//
