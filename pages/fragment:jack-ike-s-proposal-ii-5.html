It is the consensus agreement of High Command (HC), the Overseer Council (OC) and Overwatch (OW) that SCP-001 (Δ) is a causal loop focusing on the Founder of the Foundation at the time period the Foundation was established. As a result of SCP-001’s anomalous influence, there are three distinct timelines generated from this point in time.

The details of the timelines, as agreed upon by their respective High Command, Overseer Council, or Overwatch, is as following.
-----
&gt; = **Timeline ‘HC’**
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-001 conceived the notion of the Foundation by their own volition but was assassinated by an unidentified military group – speculated to be an alternate rendition of Mobile Task Force Alp-0 originating from Timeline OC and/or Timeline OW – before they could directly enact the establishment of the organisation. This period corresponds to the initiation of SCP-001’s anomalous properties in Timelines OC and OW.
&gt; 
&gt; However, SCP-001 was successful in promoting sufficient interest in the endeavour prior to their demise – and further catalysed by the clearly-anomalous circumstances around their assassination – to prompt the original thirteen members of High Command to do so in their stead. 
&gt; 
&gt; The now-anomalous cadaver/s of SCP-001, another catalyst for High Command’s actions, was successfully contained in the childhood home of SCP-001 – one of the few extant buildings at the time that predated SCP-001 (of which, at the time of writing, it exclusively remains) – before the anomaly began duplicating. 
&gt; 
&gt; How the founding High Command knew to contain SCP-001 at this location, and why they avoided using the door – instead lowering the anomaly through a hole in the ceiling – is unknown; no documentation justifying the decision, if any existed, have been found.
&gt; 
&gt; Being the first anomaly contained by the Foundation, it was designated SCP-001 following the official codification of the SCP designation.
-----
&gt; = **Timeline ‘OC’**
&gt; SCP-001 was in the process of establishing the Foundation – alongside the members of the original Overseer Council – when they began exhibiting anomalous properties, roughly corresponding to the point in time when Mobile Task Force Alp-0 intervened in Timelines HC and OW; however, no evidence has been found indicating MTF Alp-0 has been present in Timeline OC.
&gt; 
&gt; Recognising SCP-001 as a new anomalous phenomenon, the founding Overseer Council immediately devised and enforced containment measures for SCP-001, cataloguing it as their first contained anomaly.
-----
&gt; = **Timeline ‘OW’**
&gt; In Timeline OW, the Founder encounters an anachronistic military group self-identifying by the moniker Mobile Task Force Alp-0. This MTF presents the Founder with schematics for SCP-001-A (OW) and assist in its construction, which is completed at the time SCP-001 is assassinated in Timeline HC / gains properties in Timeline OC. Upon completion of this task, MTF Alp-0 departs.
&gt; 
&gt; The Founder establishes the modern Foundation for the explicit purpose of studying SCP-001-A (OW), with the original Overwatch being their initial research group; following the discovery of further anomalous phenomena that posed various threats to the Founder, Overwatch and/or their notion of normal society, the function of the Foundation expanded to include the containment and research of these phenomena as well.
&gt; 
&gt; Recognising their abnormal lack of aging in comparison to the founding Overwatch, the Founder voluntarily submitted themselves to containment and study. Following the discovery of SCP-001 (Δ), the Founder was redesignated as a component of SCP-001 (OW).
-----
It is the consensus agreement of the leading committees that SCP-001 was discovered through the unintentional preservation of the Foundation database across all three timelines. It is currently unclear how this data preservation is occurring, but is confirmed to be instantaneous relative to each timeline’s analogue of the creation date; a file created on January 1st, 2018 at 8:00 PM in Timeline HC will simultaneously appear in the database present in Timeline OC and Timeline OW on January 1st, 2018 at 8:00 PM.

Cooperation between the leading committees of each respective timeline has led to the conclusion that the majority of recorded anomalous phenomena present in the shared database only exist within one timeline; only 17 anomalies have been confirmed to exist across all three timelines.

Considering the presence of ‘Mobile Task Force Alp-0’ in both Timeline HC and Timeline OW, the consensus belief is that SCP-001 (Δ) is preserved through unclear future events that prompt the leading committees of the Foundations to dispatch this MTF, at a future date, with the intent of altering the circumstances of the Foundation’s conception, creating the next successive timeline. The order of timelines is unknown, but deemed irrelevant.

As evidenced by SCP-001’s (HC) inability to escape its containment chamber, it is agreed that MTF Alp-0 will be dispatched prior to the destruction of the containment chamber. It is believed that, as Timeline HC will be overwritten by either Timeline OC or Timeline OW as a result of this, this will result in the immediate cessation of Timeline HC, and the loss of all contents; further extrapolation based upon the fact that similar events occur at similar times across all three timelines strongly suggests Timeline OC and Timeline OW will also terminate at that time.

As a result, it is the unanimous agreement of the leading committees that SCP-001 (Δ) must be neutralised to prevent the cessation of one or all three timelines, and the resultant loss of the Foundation and humanity.

Questioning of SCP-001 (OC) by the Overseer Council has revealed that the device they intend to construct specifically executes this purpose. Cooperation between the Overseer Council and Overwatch has confirmed that SCP-001-A (OW) is similar to the device intended for construction by SCP-001 (OC). Analysis of SCP-001-A (OW) has failed to confirm how the device would be, or is, capable of neutralising SCP-001 (Δ), however SCP-001-1 (OW) has similarly confirmed the device is capable of performing this task but has failed to provide further clarification.

Because of the various SCP-001’s (HC, OC, OW) assumed (in the case of Timeline OC) desire to construct this device, and their otherwise apparent fundamental relation to SCP-001 (Δ), it is the consensus belief of the leading committees that the completion of this device across all three timelines will result in the neutralisation of SCP-001 (Δ), or at minimum enable more viable containment of SCP-001 (HC, OC) through minimisation or neutralisation of their anomalous properties.

As such, the leading committees of each timeline have agreed to complete the following:
* High Command will receive the schematics of SCP-001-A (OW) and construct it, activating it as soon as able.
* The Overseer Council will voluntarily release SCP-001 (OC) from containment, providing them with the required resources to construct SCP-001-A.
* Overwatch will provide schematics for SCP-001-A (OW) to High Command and the Overseer Council. No other actions are required, as their device is already complete.

The leading committees will cooperate to maximise the probability of this file, along with as much of the main Foundation database as possible, surviving into the ensuing timeline produced by SCP-001’s (Δ) neutralisation, for the explicit purpose of detailing SCP-001 (Δ) and its neutralisation to ensure the anomaly does not reform.

This document written and signed by unanimous agreement of the leading committees of the Foundation.

[High Command]: One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Eleven, Twelve.
[Overseer Council]: One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Eleven, Twelve.
[Overwatch]: Overseer 1, Overseer 2, Overseer 3, Overseer 4, Overseer 5, Overseer 6, Overseer 7, Overseer 8, Overseer 9, Overseer 10, Overseer 11, Overseer 12, Overseer 13[[span class=&#34;blinkbar&#34;]]_[[/span]]
