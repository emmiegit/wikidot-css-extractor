**Test 914-1208**
**Name:** WR Markham
**Date:** 12/11/2019
**Total Items:** Two hardback copies of //In My Time// by Former US Vice President Dick Cheney

**Input:** //In My Time//
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A 1:6 paper-mache model of Dick Cheney.

**Input:** //In My Time//
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A copy of //The Necessary Evil//, ostensibly authored by Liz Cheney (President of the United States 2021-2029) in 2039.
According to the book, a global war broke out in 2015 because of the actions of an SCP Foundation researcher named Madeleine Sailer, which indirectly led to the United States declaring war on Bangladesh, followed by an invasion of Kashmir by Pakistan, atomic bombings of fifty cities in ten nations, eventually leading to the public acknowledgement of the anomalous, and a new Civil Rights movement which essentially denounced the SCP Foundation&#39;s containment on sapient humanoid anomalies.
According to footnotes, by 2038, [[[SCP-029]]] was stated to have started an apocalyptic cult in Hyderabad, [[[SCP-096]]] was neutralized when Pittsburgh was nuked, while [[[scp-3009|SCP-3009-C]]], as the Governor of Minnesota, was shot during her reelection campaign. A prominent member of the Church of the Broken God was elected as a state representative from Texas.

//Note: While no memetic or cognitive hazards were detected, the autobiography was incinerated due to its written description of a certain &#34;Four Pixels flag&#34; of the new Civil Rights movement. We do not need an idiot to attempt reproduction of the flag and trigger 096 on a killing spree. - WR Markham//

-----
**Test 914-1209**
**Name:** Researcher Laskenta; D-48962
**Date:** 12/11/2019
**Total Items:** Three electronic calculators

//Note: As anomalous numbers normally represent a threat and it is not unlikely that 914 will produce such output, I got two members of Θ-90 as a security measurement. - Laskenta//

**Input:** One calculator
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** An abacus, made out of plastics and metal. The materials match the input. --Non-anomalous.--

**Input:** One calculator
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** An abacus. The individual parts of this output are constructed from different materials than they were in the previous output, but the dimensions are identical.

//Note: It is highly unusual for 914 to repeat its outputs. I will further investigate both results and deem both as anomalous for the time being. Even if there is a good chance that 914 messes with us again. - Laskenta//

**Input:** One calculator
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** The input, with five additional buttons, labelled &#34;StA 1&#34;, &#34;StA 2&#34;, &#34;LfA 1&#34;, &#34;LfA 2&#34; and &#34;Introduce&#34; respectively. Pressing one of the two &#34;StA&#34; buttons will cause an anomalous effect that moves one of the above created abaci into the state that represents the value shown on the display of this output. Pressing one of the two &#34;LfA&#34; buttons will paste a value shown on one of the abaci onto the output. --Pressing the &#34;Introduce&#34; button results in an anomalous effect that introduces the sum of the values shown on both abaci to the set of natural numbers.-- Pressing the &#34;Introduce&#34; button results in a cognitohazardous sound that affects every human that hears the button being pressed. Affected subjects will believe that the sum of the values shown on both abaci has been added to the set of natural numbers until they are reminded that the sum of two natural numbers will lead to another existing natural number.

**Input:** One bottle of hand sanitizer.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One bottle with a spray nozzle instead of a hand pump, labelled &#34;Full-body sanitizer&#34;. Testing revealed the spray to be extremely caustic to any materials touching the user&#39;s skin, including but not limited to bacteria, hair, tattoos, clothes, and metal jewelry. Any skin exposed to the spray is completely sanitized with minor temporary skin irritation. Unscrewing the spray nozzle from the bottle revealed the contents themselves to be ordinary hand sanitizer with no anomalous properties. Bottle and contents incinerated separately.

**Input:** One Dragonzord.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A toy model of Mechagodzilla md. Kiryu from //Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla.//

//Note: Fair enough. -Prof. Wren//

**Input:** One Falconzord.

//Note: Yeah, we don&#39;t need anyone around here Falcon Punching anyone else, thanks. -Prof. Wren//

**Input:** One Red Battlezord.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** The same toy configured as a twin-barreled gatling gun. This configuration is not known to be possible. Toy could be converted to normal humanoid configuration and back afterward.

**Input:** One Brachiozord.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A trio of small, black/gold toy model Utahraptors. Upon booth opening, model raptors jumped on D-class and launched an unsuccessful attack. Models smashed and incinerated.

//Note: Okay, time for the last one. -Prof. Wren//

**Input:** The remaining Zord models.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** The four Zord models combined together as follows:
-The Dragonzord in its &#34;Battle Mode&#34; torso configuration. Tail and chest plate stored inside the Brachiozord.
-The Falconzord on the Dragonzord&#39;s back with its wings clamped around the torso and its wingtips facing forward.
-The Red Battlezord&#39;s chest piece split in two to separate the arms and folded over to form shoulder plates, connected to the outside of the Falconzord&#39;s wings. The gatling guns around the hands are extended. Its feet are detached and connected at the base of the Dragonzord&#39;s legs. The remaining pieces are stored inside the Brachiozord.
-The above combination is standing atop the Brachiozord, whose neck and head are lowered and straightened out, with a cannon barrel in its mouth.

//Note: Wow...not sure what I was expecting, but a Tommy Oliver zord combination...perhaps &#34;T.O. Ultrazord&#34; would be a good name for it?...was not anywhere near what I thought it&#39;d do. I honestly expected this test to go w-- - Prof. Wren//

//Note: 15 seconds after output booth opened, the &#34;T.O. Ultrazord&#34; began moving towards D-class. Multiple bursts of holographic weapons-fire erupted from its gattling arms, wing tips, and Brachiozord head cannon, accompanied by the sounds of laser fire and &#34;Go Go Power Rangers&#34; by Ron Wasserman. No damage was caused by the illusionnary blaster barrage, though D-class later mentioned feeling compelled to holler in pain and fall flat on his back after being struck by multiple bolts, at which time a holographic explosion erupted from D-class and filled the room.//

//Note: Further tests have shown the effect only occurs when the &#34;T.O. Ultrazord&#34; is placed within 1.2 meters of a D-class, suggesting it only &#34;attacks&#34; those it considers &#34;evil.&#34;//

**Test 914-1217**
**Name:** Researcher Ija Rasclon
**Date:** 12/11/2019
**Total Items:** Five 1mg samples of Thorium-226

//Note: We don&#39;t know exactly what kind of anomaly 914 is, but we can narrow this down by figuring out what it is not. This test intends to see if 914 possesses any kind of temporal anomaly. Given that it cannot cause transmutation, timing it with radioisotopes should prevent non-temporal effects from changing the output. - R. Rasclon//

**Input:** One sample
**Setting:** Rough
**Refinement time:** 7:03
**Decay time:** ~9 mins
**Output:** Sample seemed to have been spread out to approximately thrice its original radius, as though by compressive force.

**Input:** One sample
**Setting:** Coarse
**Refinement time:** 2:32. This is an outlier from usual refinement time.
**Decay time:** ~1 min
**Output:** Sample had been bisected.

**Input:** One sample
**Setting:** 1:1
**Refinement time:** 5:53
**Decay time:** ~4 mins
**Output:** Output sample was misshapen.

**Input:** One sample
**Setting:** Fine
**Refinement time:** 5:12
**Decay time:** ~5 mins
**Output:** The output was perfectly spherical.

//Note: The fact that the decay time has been so divergent for this many tests may suggest some kind of minor temporal aberration. - R. Rasclon// 

**Input:** One sample
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Refinement time:** 9:14
**Decay time:** ~5 mins
**Output:** The sample is selectively corporeal. What the criteria are is unknown, but it fails to interact with tin, water, and concrete. It does interact with steel however, meaning that standard containment is effective. Anomalous effects lingered after decay. 

//Note: This item was classified as 914-O-55. The decay time was just writing out the ID. I might try this test again when psych clears me for work-induced stress. - R. Rasclon//

**Name:** Researcher Darby, Intern Snevets
**Date:** 13/11/2019
**Total Items:** One broken Sherman Calliope model, one waterlogged Nimitz Carrier model, one scorched Russian farm model

//Note: The subjects of today&#39;s tests are already broken so I feel no need to run them through SCP-914 on a setting which more often than not results in a more damaged or disassembled input. - Researcher Darby//

**Input:** One broken Sherman Calliope model
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One damaged Wurfrahmen 40 model

**Input:** One waterlogged Nimitz Carrier model
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One soaked Lusitania model

**Input:** One scorched Russian farm model
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One burnt German apartment model

//Note: The next test was ran by Intern Snevets who suggested running the previous outputs through on “Very Fine” while I left the area to appropriate some tea. - Researcher Darby//

**Input:** Results from all of the above logs
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One large dented Panzer V Model

//Note: Seems fairly normal, painted in winter camo used in 1944, think I might be able to keep this? - Intern Snevets//

//Note: After Intern Snevets wrote the last note, Researcher Darby entered the room and was immediately forcibly removed due to the Panzer V model firing a Bean Bag Slug from its cannon, knocking him out of the room. Said Panzer V then began moving with no visible means of propulsion and attempted to crush Researcher Darby underneath its treads. Researcher Darby was merely lightly scratched due to the mass of the Panzer not being enough to seriously damage a human. Entity has been contained and marked for destruction after the Research Team, led by Researcher Darby and Research Assistant Walker, took it apart. - Security Chief Sedna//

//Note: I don&#39;t know why, but I seem to feel a mixture of nostalgia and dread. - Veritas//

**Test 914-1234**
**Name:** GR Derick
**Date:** 13/11/2019
**Total Items:** Three 1 kg blocks of bismuth

//Note: I’ve seen tests of raw materials put in with different properties after being processed. Due to bismuth’s already unusual properties, I figured it either wouldn’t change too much, or would be completely different. - GR Derrick//

**Input:** 1kg block of bismuth
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** All properties are the same except for when it is crystalized. Instead of the square pyramid shape it usually makes, it is instead a more triangular-shaped pyramid.

**Input:** 1kg block of bismuth
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** Visually unchanged, but is strongly magnetic instead of diamagnetic.

//Note: For those unaware, bismuth is the strongest diamagnetic metal element, meaning it repels magnets. That being said, I am now going to try putting it through on Fine. - GR Derrick//

**Input:** 1kg block of bismuth
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Visually unchanged, but the diamagnetic force has been largely increased and affects any magnetic material within a five meter radius. Everything outside the radius is unaffected regardless of its magnetic strength, along with 914 itself.

//Note: Not really sure how to get rid of this, because it might cause the incinerator to blow outwards. I was probably asking for that after bringing up magnets, wasn’t I? - GR Derrick//

//Note: Anomalous effect ceased after crushing. Remains incinerated. - Veritas//

**Input:** One copy.
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** An origami replica of [[[SCP-682]]].

//Note: D-class in testing area was attacked immediately upon output booth opening. D-class terminated via impact with opposing wall; despite being constructed of paper, the replica had immense strength. Replica terminated by security personnel armed with flamethrowers. D-class was treated for concussion, numerous paper cuts, and 1st-degree burns to the left leg.//

//Note: Okay, okay, 914. I can take a hint. Now if you&#39;ll all excuse me, I&#39;m going to go have nightmares about the two skips I just learned about. -Prof. Wren//

//Note: Remainder of tests cancelled. Remaining report copies incinerated. Wren, drop by my office if you feel like you need amnestics. And don&#39;t try this again. - Veritas//

**Total Items:** One paperback copy of //1984// by George Orwell, one printed copy of //Broken Masquerade// as it appears in test 914-0770

**Input:** Both books
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A copy of //2061//, ostensibly authored by Harry Styles in 2016. The book detailed the efforts of an &#34;Austin Del Rey&#34; to reveal the anomalous reality to the public. The first three quarters of the book followed a plot similar to both //1984// (1948 novel) and the SCP-3922 affected version of //1984// (1984 film), then deviates to a plot similar to //Broken Masquerade//, before ending with his failure due to betrayals, followed by a mass administration of Class-F and Class-A amnestics in the Federation of Oceania and the Union of Neo-Bolshevik Eurasian Republics.

//Note: The ending quote is just... correct in every sense. &#34;Consensus reality is an illusion, but without it, everything that we knew, everything that we loved, everything that we upheld, they all would collapse, breaking all of civilization down as we knew it.&#34; Placed in the break room as an allegory for everyone. - WR Markham//

**Name:** Junior Researcher Pines
**Date:** 13/11/2019
**Total Items:** Two King James Bibles, a Koran, a Torah 

**Input:** One King James Bible
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A book called, “Deeds in Wake of Atatum.” The book describes people and events of Sarkics throughout history. Most events described in the book were already known to the Foundation although, some people and places were unknown to the Foundation and thus were handed over to the Security Department for intelligence purposes.

**Input:** All Items
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A three-hundred-page manuscript titled, “The Grand Testament.” The book is written to bring all three of the Abrahamic religions under one doctrine. It was confirmed that this manuscript was written by the Horizon Initiative and to avoid open conflict between the Initiative and The Foundation, the manuscript was returned after being copied and saved on Foundation databases. All extra papers were folded up into a paper replica of the Pope, with no anomalous features.

**Total Items:** One 1cm cube of scandium, titanium, vanadium, chromium, and manganese, each contained in glass

**Input:** 1cm cube of glass filled with scandium
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** An ornate blackish pyramid made of tarnished scandium, similar in design to the Pyramid of Giza, sitting in a sprinkling of sand. The capstone is made of uranium-thorium alloy.

//Note: I thought these samples were pure. - R.A. Walker//

**Input:** 1cm cube of glass filled with titanium
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A toothpick made of titanium-silicon alloy.

**Input:** 1cm cube of glass filled with vanadium
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A statue of Dr. Veritas, made of vanadium. The base is made of pure silicon. The etching makes it hard to see his face. Touching it while Dr. Veritas is angry will cause the subject to be afflicted with mild vanadium poisoning.

//Note: 914 is turning my element collectables into researcher collectables. I&#39;m not sure how I feel about this. This is going on my shelf, as far away from the phosphorus Darby as possible. - R.A. Walker//

**Input:** 1cm cube of glass filled with chromium
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A miniature model of a chrome silicate bumper.

**Input:** 1cm cube of glass filled with manganese
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A 10cm × 10cm × 5mm hollow glass pane, partially filled with magnesium oxide. When a magnetic field is introduced, the magnesium oxide is influenced into a pattern, following the field. Object destroyed when an attempt was made to move it. Remains discarded.

//Note: This is the second time this week that the output was destroyed because the glass was too thin. Perhaps I should start excluding the glass. - R.A. Walker//

//Note: Please do, half of my hand is in bandages from the amount of glass still in the containment area. - Junior Researcher Pines//

**Test 914-1241**
**Name:** Doctor Margin
**Date:** 14/11/2019
**Total Items:** One copy of Finnegans Wake. One copy of SCP-2337&#39;s file.

**Input:** Above items.
**Setting:** Very Fine.
**Output:** One book which, when opened, causes the reader to become distressed and sob uncontrollably. Initially, it was believed subjects could not speak coherently, but it is now believed they can only recite passages of Finnegans Wake in a dialect and vocabulary identical to SCP-2337, mixed with quotations from Finnegans Wake. A single piece of paper was found at the end of the book, upon which was written the opening lyrics of &#34;Sound of Silence&#34; by Simon and Garfunkel, written in a dialect and vocabulary consistent with the book&#39;s anomalous properties. Another piece of paper, written in broken English, requested the presence of MT Johnson.

//Note: I have to ask, why did you attempt this in the first place, Margin? - Veritas//

//Note: For science, why else? - Margin//

//Note: Yeah, don&#39;t do that again. As overly dramatic as that reaction was, this test clearly caused 914 severe distress. That is, if it is sentient. That isn&#39;t what we do here. Nowhere is it stated that we force an SCP to endure &#34;Finnegans Wake&#34; and Doctor Spanko&#39;s nonsense at the same time. - Veritas//

**Test 914-1242**
**Name:** Senior Researcher Vivic
**Date:** 14/11/2019
**Total Items:** Eight 50.8cmx76.2cm (20”x30”) printed canvas portraits with wooden oak frames. 

**Input:** A copy of The Mona Lisa 
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One life like self portrait of Leonardo Da Vinci. 

**Input:** A picture of facility 23 from the parking lot edge. 
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One full body portrait of Dr. Veritas wearing 1960 era nobleman attire, smoking a long wooden pipe with a look of disdain and fatigue. The image is painted in a photorealistic manor. 

//Note: After this clears hazard inspection, I&#39;m going to deliver it to Dr. Veritas along with a 20 year malt whiskey. - Vivic//

**Input:** A copy of The Starry Night
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** The wooden frame has become unnaturally bent to resemble a long swaying flag common in medieval times with the canvas stretched over it evenly. The image on the canvas flag is that of the British Empire circa 1788. 

**Input:** A landscape photograph of the Rocky Mountains in B.C. Canada (2018 via helicopter)
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** The colours of the photo and the topology of the mountains were inverted, with the output image now resembling a ravine. The artwork is depicted in a photorealistic nature to match the input. 

//Note: That looks like something from a video game, like No Man’s Sky, but so real. - Vivic//

**Input:** A landscape image of an unnamed man sitting beside a roaring campfire. 
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A pop culture depiction of the burning gates of Hell build into a brimstone brick wall. On the wall are advertisements for a company called “Suffering Incorporated” with the following visible tagline. “At Suffering Incorporated your pain is our profit, enjoy damnation with us.” A depiction of a red &#39;&#39;imp&#39;&#39; is flying in the background above the wall. 

//Note: Well that&#39;s very interesting, eerie, and kinda terrifying in its own way, I like it, and might keep it. - Vivic//

**Input:** A portrait of the &#39;&#39;Ronald McDonald&#39;&#39; the mascot for the McDonald&#39;s fast food chain.  
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A landscape image of eight clowns standing shoulder to shoulder filling condiment bottles by blowing their noses into the openings. The artwork is in a photorealistic style and when viewed causes mild to medium levels of discomfort in viewers, however, this appears to be a completely natural reaction to the imagery. 

//Note: Thanks 914, I hate it. - Vivic//

**Input:** A landscape image of SCP-914
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** The same image but SCP-914 is visibly cleaner and polished to a shine. 

**Input:** One portrait on Dr. Beiderman
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A full body portrait of Dr. Beiderman wearing 1980 era nobleman attire with a mild sadness in his facial expression, with a soothing royal purple background to match his tie. The artwork is painted a photorealistic nature.

**Test 914-1245**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Kai
**Date:** 16/11/2019
**Total Items:** One Dyson &#39;&#39;Supersonic&#39;&#39; hair dryer

//Note: Anonymous lotteries can give some really weird prizes. On a related note, Dr. Cahill will be back in a week, so I might as well make this a gift for her. - J.R. Kai//

**Input:** One Dyson Supersonic hair dryer
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One Dyson Airwrap hair styler

//Note: That&#39;s really thoughtful of you, 914. Now, where can I get myself some wrapping paper? - J.R. Kai//

//Note: Right next to the anomalous screening department. While you&#39;re at it, get that thing screened there before you give a potentially anomalous object away. Your prize for doing this is keeping your testing license. - Veritas//

**Test 914-1246**
**Name:** Intern Regal
**Date:** 16/11/2019
**Total Items:** Three [REDACTED]-brand flash drives containing a sorting algorithm, a word replacement algorithm, and an evolutionary algorithm.

//Note: This is my first test with SCP-914 and after reading through the logs, I have noticed that experiments with a set of programs that somewhat mimic the functions of this SCP object have never been conducted and might yield interesting results. After all, giving an input and allowing a machine to process it to obtain an output is basically the same process as when we use algorithms, without the anomalous randomness that comes with 914. - Intern Regal//

**Input:** One flash drive, containing a sorting algorithm
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** One unchanged flash drive, containing the original program content with each symbol and string having being rearranged. Further examination has revealed that the new order follows their ASCII code values.

**Input:** One flash drive, containing a word replacement algorithm
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One unchanged flash drive, containing a number replacement program. Inputted sets of numbers are replaced with sets of numbers with similar progression arithmetically or geometrically.

//Note: Could be useful. - Intern Regal//

**Input:** One flash drive, containing an evolutionary algorithm
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One flash drive, containing an executable program. Upon initiation of said program, a window marking a request for the initial settings appears, some of which include the atmosphere, landscape and beginning species. Once the initial settings are given, a simulation is presented, displaying the development of all species in the described habitat through the specified number of generations. Information on the survival probability of the species, the adaptations developed and interactions presented are also presented. It has been discovered that the given settings do not allow any environmental conditions similar to the surface of the Earth.

//Note: An evolutionary algorithm uses mechanisms inspired by biological evolution to optimize generic populations based on a predetermined objective. The 914 version of the program greatly improves the complexity of the species and their environments with great potential. However, the fact that it doesn’t allow any of the environmental settings to resemble those on Earth severely limits its application. - Intern Regal//

**Test 914-1247**
**Name:** Researcher Bronbehren
**Date:** 16/11/2019
**Total Items:** One note reading, “Can we be friends, 914?”

//Note: This seems to be a rite of passage for all new researchers, so I thought I’d give it a try. - R. Bronbehren//

**Input:** Note
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A get well soon card, depicting Researcher Bronbehren in a hospital bed with third-degree burns and no left eye.

//Note: If you do at some future point lose that eye, I can make you a replacement. - S.R. Vivic//

**Test 914-1248**
**Name:** Researcher Connolly
**Date:**17/11/2019
**Total Items:** One copy each of five different Shakespeare plays

//Note: Hopefully this test will provide more insight into 914’s debated sentience. - Researcher Connolly//

**Input:** One copy of &#39;&#39;Romeo and Juliet&#39;&#39;
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A delicately-crafted origami rose. When touched, causes the holder to incorrectly identify it as some other genus of flower. Examples include daffodil, tulip, chrysanthemum, rhododendron, and [REDACTED].

**Input:** One copy of &#39;&#39;Julius Caesar&#39;&#39;
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A pile of ash and three death certificates, all from the year XLIV. The certificates identify “MARCVS IVNIVS BRVTVS”, “GAIVS CASSIVS LONGINVS”, and “GAIVS IVLIVS CAESAR”. Notably, Caesar’s death certificate appears to have several jagged holes through it.

**Input:** One copy of &#39;&#39;Hamlet&#39;&#39;
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A copy of &#39;&#39;Hamlet&#39;&#39;. Identical up until the fifth act, where it diverges. In this version, Hamlet is never struck by Laertes, and survives until the end of the play. Prince Hamlet then goes on to inherit the throne and begins founding a new era of the Danish monarchy which is more authoritarian in nature.

//Note: Not the strangest fanfiction I’ve read about Hamlet, but I wouldn’t exactly send this to a publisher. - Researcher Connolly//

**Input:** One copy of &#39;&#39;Othello&#39;&#39;
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** The same copy of &#39;&#39;Othello&#39;&#39;. Causes a cognitohazardous effect causing whoever holds the book to become increasingly paranoid and jealous of whoever is nearby, typically resulting in violence. Item incinerated successfully.

**Input:** One copy of &#39;&#39;Macbeth&#39;&#39;
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A play titled “Connolly”. The plot structure is nearly identical to that of Macbeth, but the setting and characters are replaced with Facility-23 and its personnel. 

//Note: So according to this, I am Macbeth, Prof. Wren is Lady Macbeth, Veritas is King Duncan, Kai is Malcolm, and Rasclon is Macduff. What’s perhaps the most interesting is apparently the murder of Veritas/Duncan occurs by him being thrown into 914 set on Rough. - Researcher Connolly//

//Note: This is probably the best result you could have hoped for with Macbeth. - R. Rasclon//

**Test 914-1249**
**Name:** Dr. Meyer
**Date:** 17/11/2019
**Total Items:** 18g of sand

**Input:** 6g of sand
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One 6g block of sandstone that crumbled upon contact

**Input:** 12g of sand
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One 12g shard of frosted glass

**Input:** Glass shard from previous experiment
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One 12g clear glass cube

**Input:** Glass cube from previous experiment
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Three 4g floating glass marbles. Exited the output chamber and started orbiting Dr. Meyer. After roughly 30 seconds, the marbles accelerated and attempted to strike Dr. Meyer. While two of the marbles missed, and shattered on the walls of the testing chamber, the other successfully pierced Dr. Meyer’s right arm. Remains of the marbles display no anomalous qualities.

//Note: That marble accelerated faster than a musket ball and shattered both his right radius and ulna. Now we know what happens when you put 914&#39;s outputs through &#34;Fine&#34; multiple times. - J.R. Kai//

**Total Items:** Three pieces of notepaper with various phrases or sentences written on them

//Note: I visited the Site-19 main campus yesterday morning to see an old friend and promptly got caught up in a containment breach within an hour just after arriving. [[[SCP-049]]] also managed to breach containment when security was redirected and he... it walked past where we hunkered down to hide. Holy hell, that... that thing is __scary__. We even observed it create an SCP-049-2 instance __right outside__ our hallway... anyways, I&#39;m back now and I&#39;ll be having nightmares about that skip for the next few weeks. Let&#39;s see what 914 thinks about some of the gibberish 049 spouted. - J.R. Kai//

**Input:** One note, reading &#34;My cure is //most// effective.&#34;
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One note, reading &#34;His cure is not //that// effective.&#34;

//Note: I&#39;d agree with that. The SCP-049-2 instance looked more like a hastily-made zombie. - J.R. Kai//

**Input:** One note, reading &#34;The Pestilence is deeply rooted in this one.&#34;
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One origami figurine of SCP-049, anomalously impervious to ink. Inputted ink on the note was deposited in a puddle around the figurine. Output incinerated.

**Input:** One note, reading &#34;This one will do. The Pestilence is kept at bay, albeit temporarily.&#34;
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One note, with inputted ink rearranged into a crude cognitohazard that improves memory retention for the next six hours before all sustained mental strain is released at once. Junior Researcher Kai has been temporarily warded in the medical bay and the note transferred to MTF Eta-10 (&#34;See No Evil&#34;) for further investigation.

//Note: Going to experience the cranium panium in six hours. Great. - J.R. Kai//

**Total Items:** One administrative map each of the following: the British Isles, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, England, and the Isle of Man

**Input:** Map of the British Isles
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A map, displaying northern Europe after a zombie virus outbreak. While the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Nordic countries, and Estonia survived, many others collapsed. The European Union is based out of Mariehamn, Åland Islands, and the city itself is noted to have a population of 118 thousand, 12.3 percent of which are Finnic. The United Kingdom and Ireland have had their capitals relocated to Liverpool and Cork respectively.

**Input:** Map of Ireland
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A map of &#34;United Ireland&#34;, with the six counties of Northern Ireland reunited to the 26 of the Republic of Ireland. County Dublin (administratively split into four) and the old border between County Antrim and County Down (to make way for a County Belfast) are highlighted. The County Down portion of Lisburn is assigned to Hillsborough.

//Note: Is this supposed to be a 26+6=1 argument? - Dr. Cleveland//

**Input:** Map of Northern Ireland
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A religious map of Northern Ireland, with the Catholic-Protestant border drawn upon.

//Note: Yes, 914, we know that Northern Ireland is a hot potato. We don&#39;t need any more of that. - Dr. Cleveland//

**Input:** Map of Scotland
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A map of Scotland, with the Caledonian Canal as the border between the &#34;Gaelic Free State&#34; and the Confederation of Scotland. Shetland is missing from the map, but Berwick-upon-Tweed is within Scottish borders. The map is labelled &#34;Scotland, 15 years after the Ministry of Magic became known, and the nuclear war of 1996.&#34;

//Note: According to the note at the back, Scotland is the worst off of the four British nations, with cities like Aberdeen and Inverness getting nuked. Scotland&#39;s capital is Perth, of all cities. - Dr. Cleveland//

**Input:** Map of Wales
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A map of Lebanon. The note behind it compared Lebanese Christians to Welsh speakers, and Lebanese Muslims to English speakers.

**Test 914-1252**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Townsend
**Date:** 17/11/2019
**Total Items:** Sixteen green plastic soldiers, one beige plastic toy tank.

**Input:** All of the above
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** Sixteen animate green plastic soldiers, twelve of whom were &#34;wounded&#34;. One beige plastic toy tank, which had been &#34;destroyed&#34;. 

//The majority of the soldiers had been remolded in several ways to look like they were covered in bandages or heavily wounded. The animate soldiers spend most of the time &#34;treating&#34; the wounded, or &#34;limping&#34; around aimlessly. The tank was discovered to have a driver, although said driver was missing their upper half. After close study, it was determined that the entities move by heating and cooling their joints. - Junior Researcher Townsend//

**Test 914-1254**
**Name:** Researcher Darby
**Date:** 19/11/2019
**Total Items:** 394kg of river clay

//Note: You may ask how I got this here. Simple: I used a dump truck. As to how I got that dump truck, better not to ask. On an additional note, the clay has been sterilized in order to destroy any organic organisms present. - Researcher Darby//

//Note: I have a question. How did the guards not notice that monster of a dump truck stinking to high heaven in the parking lot? - Junior Researcher Kai//

**Input:** 50kg of river clay
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** 50kg of clay dust

**Input:** 50kg of river clay
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** Fifty 1kg balls of unchanged river clay

**Input:** 50kg of river clay
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** 50kg of granite

**Input:** 50kg of river clay
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One hundred 0.5kg clay snake sculptures

//Note: These snakes are perfectly cylindrical and have the exact same length using all methods of measurement. Looks like something that came out of some really high-quality factory machinery, and strangely enough, a little like tootsie rolls too. - Researcher Darby//

**Input:** 50kg of river clay
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One 50kg clay humanoid sculpture (inanimate)

//Note: Looks rather like Dr. Veritas actually - a really aggravated Veritas. I wonder what might have happened to make him look like this? - Researcher Darby//

**Input:** 50kg of river clay
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One50 kg clay humanoid sculpture (inanimate)

//Note: This one looks like Professor Wren. Wow, you can get to see __all__ her features really clearly in a clay medium. - Researcher Darby//

//Note: Dr. Veritas has requested Prof. Wren to come see him in his office. Researcher Darby is being treated for a nasal fracture. - Medical Staff//

//Note: Not even remotely sorry. - Prof. Wren//

**Input:** 50kg of river clay
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One 50kg clay humanoid sculpture (inanimate)

//Note: This one looks like me, and it has [Illegible]. I am getting a bit worried as to what will happen [Illegible]. - Researcher Darby//

**Input:** 44kg of river clay
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One 44kg ceramic statue of an unknown female (animate)

//Note: The statue exited the Output booth under its own power and proceeded to approach Researcher Darby. Security in the room was readied for a hostile confrontation, per the norm and ordered Researcher Darby to leave the area. However, Researcher Darby ignored all such orders and made no attempt to escape, seeming resigned to death by statue. All expectations of a violent engagement were shattered when instead of killing Researcher Darby, the statue embraced him until Security separated the two. Researcher Darby was led away after security personnel detained the statue peacefully.
Incidentally, it appears that Researcher Darby&#39;s nosebleed had been healed during the embrace. Researcher Darby was later found weeping over a cup of tea in the cafeteria. The entity has been cleared as a non-sentient automaton that follows all verbal commands given and is currently being researched for possible applications. - Agent Sedna//

**Test 914-1255**
**Name:** R.A. Walker
**Date:** 19/11/2019
**Total Items:** Three pepperoni flavored &#39;&#39;Hot Pockets&#39;&#39; which were recently removed from the microwave. Prior approval for use of biological material as input obtained 17/11/2019 by Dir. ██████.

//Note: They appear to faintly glow white when I&#39;m not wearing my glasses. - R.A. Walker//

**Input:** One Hot Pocket
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One small pepperoni pizza
**Black Body Radiation:** &#34;IR-White&#34; - 7.8µm peak, ~110°C

//Note: It should appear teal to me, but I suspect that it doesn&#39;t for the same reason that Polaris doesn&#39;t. Hot things emit a wide range of wavelengths due to black-body radiation, and that triggers all three cone cells at some point. As such, I am using special instruments to measure the temperature and peak emitted wavelength of each output. - R.A. Walker//

**Input:** One Hot Pocket
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One Hot Pocket. The &#34;crisping sleeve&#34; reflects 99.983% of all heat back into the Hot Pocket, making it hotter, and making it cool slower.
**Black Body Radiation:** &#34;IR-White&#34; - 7.4µm peak, ~120°C

**Input:** One Hot Pocket
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One &#34;Pocket of Heat&#34;. The floor of the output booth is tarnished from where the &#34;Pocket of Heat&#34; was. It had to be removed with tungsten tongs, as steel tongs melted and subsequently boiled into metal gas. &#34;Pocket of Heat&#34; was thrown into the incinerator, where it continued growing hotter until it melted. Melted carbon deemed non-anomalous.
**Black Body Radiation:** Red - 710nm peak, ~3000°C

//Note: How did it not catch fire? - R.A. Walker//

//Note: That stunt of yours damaged the incinerator. Next time, don&#39;t incinerate things without authorisation. I want the output booth clean by tomorrow. - Veritas//

//Note: I got a __very__ short note from Inter-Site Maintenance this morning, Lucius. It says, &#34;We fixed it barely two weeks ago.&#34; Do send someone to supervise the new researchers if they plan on using the incinerator this month. - Site Director Hackett//

//Note: Arthur, there&#39;s no helping these people. I don&#39;t know where half of them got their degrees, but they wouldn&#39;t test responsibly even at gunpoint. I talked to Inter-Site. The repair cost comes out of Walker&#39;s salary. Incidentally, Dir. ██████ is not actually authorised to clear biological material. - Veritas//

//Note: Duly noted, and very well. Dir. ██████ will face disciplinary action accordingly. - Site Director Hackett//

**Total Items:** Several sheets of paper, an EOD robot equipped with a standard foundation camera and one lux meter, three flashlights, two camping lanterns, and five 300 Watts light bulbs.

//Note: A previous test log indicated that one of the factors that can affect how 914 process any given input is the illuminance or light level that its subject to; As such, I thought that seeing how does the illuminance changes affect the output might give us some insight into 914. The tests will be done by an EOD robot to reduce the amount of possible variance that the person operating 914 might add. The various lighting equipment will be used to accurately set the illuminance the desired value.- Intern Regal//

**Input:** One sheet of paper.
**Setting:** Coarse
**Illuminance:** 150 lux (normal light level)
**Output:** Two sheets of paper with the same proportion as the input and half its size spread on the floor of the output boot.

**Input:** One sheet of paper.
**Setting:** Coarse
**Illuminance:** 1000 lux 
**Output:** Thirteen sheets of paper of different sizes placed one on top of the other, from the top sheet onwards each is 20% smaller than the last one while retaining the same proportion. The sum of all of the paper equals the mass of the input.

//Note: This next level of illuminance required the use of all the lighting equipment, the result is similar to full daylight. -Intern Regal//

**Input:** One sheet of paper.
**Setting:** Coarse
**Illuminance:** 15000 lux 
**Output:** Upon opening of the output boot a class 4 laser burned the side of the EOD robot, slightly reducing the actions it was capable of performing. Inside the boot, there were 20 paper triangles of equal size.

//Note: Seems that some of the light present when closing the input door got reorganize into the laser, I&#39;ll take that into consideration for the next tests.-Intern Regal//

**Input:** One sheet of paper.
**Setting:** Coarse
**Illuminance:** 15000 lux 
**Output:** One hundred sheets of paper covering the floor of the output boot. The mass of all the paper in the output boot is consistent with the input.

**Input:** One sheet of paper.
**Setting:** Coarse
**Illuminance:** 15000 lux 
**Output:**  --A layer of dust inside the output boot.-- An undetermined number of sheets of paper each of microscopic size.

//Note: Though the small sample size may not allow us to draw any definitive conclusion, it indicates that increasing the light level of the research cell 109-B may result in the more potent application of the “refining” that 914 does, at least on Coarse. Further testing with the other settings is required to sustain this hypothesis. - Intern Regal//

**Test 914-1257**
**Name:** Researcher Bronbehren
**Date:** 19/11/2019
**Total Items:** One Mac laptop, one Dell laptop

**Input:** Mac
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Upon startup, the computer was noticeably faster but had less battery life, and after further testing, it was shown that the exterior had been anomalously strengthened.

//Note: It runs a lot better, but if I open Minecraft, the battery dies in twenty minutes. It even runs out if the charger is plugged in and more than the desktop is open. - R. Bronbehren//

**Input:** Dell
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** --Unchanged input-- After extensive testing, it was found that Cortana, the windows virtual assistant, was now an extremely advanced AI capable of problem-solving conversation. There is also no way to turn it off, and its “advice” is sometimes malicious.

//Note: It told me that, mathematically, I am the worst CS:GO player it has ever seen. - R. Bronbehren//


**Input:** Outputs from the previous two tests
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A much larger computer with the logo of a window with one panel shattered. Upon startup, it appeared to be running a combination of Windows and Mac OS called “Mindows,” which had features from both operating systems. The advanced Cortana was still present, although it now had the voice and visage of the late Steve Jobs. During performance testing, the output melted, and Researcher Bronberen sustained third-degree burns.

//Note: Great, the get well card I got in the previous test was some sort of premonition. I’m going to wear safety goggles from now on. - R. Bronbehren//

**Input:** 2nd degree Sierpinski Triangle (from prior test)
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** One Sierpinski Triangle on a sheet of paper. Triangle has now regressed to only 1st fractal dimension, with a total of 3 triangles.

**Input:** 1st degree Sierpinski Triangle (from prior test)
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** Sheet of paper with a normal triangle on it (0th fractal dimension Sierpinski triangle).

**Input:** Triangle Print (from prior test)
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** Sheet of paper with one 1cm thick line of ink printed on it.

**Input:** One Sierpinski Triangle
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One 5th fractal dimension Mandelbrot set on 22cm x 36cm paper.

**Input:** One Sierpinski Triangle
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One Sierpinski Triangle on a sheet of paper, degree of triangle has raised to 10th fractal dimension (59,049 triangles), smallest triangle in the fractal has been measured at 3.2 nm

**Input:** 10th degree Sierpinski Triangle
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One Sierpinski Triangle on a sheet of paper, degree of triangle has raised to 14th fractal dimension. Output examined on an electron microscope shows the molecular structure of the ink to consist of Sierpinski Triangles.

//Note: Any further and I think it&#39;ll start rearranging the atoms of this thing into triangles. I frankly don&#39;t want to know what subatomic principles that would violate. - Dr. Fujiwara//

//Note: Lucky for you, you&#39;re still __alive__. Don&#39;t push your luck. - Dr. Veritas//

**Input:** One Sierpinski Triangle
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One tetrahedron made of folded paper. Paper appears to have smaller self-similar tetrahedrons visible inside it. Mass measured of paper to be identical to input, though no evidence of ink can be found. Attempts to unfold the paper have failed. The object is pending classification.

//Note: I could only postulate that the ink&#39;s hidden somewhere inside this shape. The tools I tried using on it got stuck inside. I think I just accidentally made a paper tesseract of some sort. - Dr. Fujiwara//

**Input:** One Mandelbrot Set (from prior test)
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One sphere of paper, with a surface area equal to that of the original sheet. Immediately upon physical contact with the paper, it began to explosively crumple into a pattern resembling a three-dimensional Mandelbrot Curve. Dr. Fujiwara treated for minor lacerations to fingers.

**Test 914-1261**
**Name:** Senior Researcher Vivic
**Date:** 20/11/2019
**Total Items:** Seven assorted kitchen appliances manufactured across different years

//Note: Testing stuff on very fine again, so I got the blast shield up and armour on. - S.R. Vivic//

**Input:** One electric blender, circa 1975
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One unbranded electric blender. Etched on the base is 202020. The model has a cyberpunk aesthetic and is fully operational, however drawing far more power than the original blender by requiring an electrical supply at 360V and 40A to function on the lowest speed. Testing has shown its ability to blend any item (organic or otherwise) with 220% efficiency within 10 seconds of operation through anomalous or highly advanced means of operation. 

**Input:** One electric blender, circa 2002
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One device in similar shape and design to a handgun with a vertical rectangular barrel, requiring two D-size cell batteries to operate. When supplied with batteries and the trigger is pulled, a 2cm wide, 1mm thick saw blade will be expelled from the barrel spinning at roughly 3000rpm at up to speeds of 380m/s. There is no limit to the number of micro saw blades produced and it is unknown where they come from. A source of acceleration has also yet to be identified. Two fully charged batteries will allow 24 shots to be fired from the weapon after which the trigger will lock up. The weapon slide will only move when fired, yet nothing is ejected and it cannot be opened by physical force. 

//Note: I&#39;m going to study its anomalous ability of creating matter from electrical energy and see if I can get some help from Research &amp; Development to reverse-engineer it. - S.R. Vivic//

**Input:** One 4-slotted toaster, circa 2015
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A medium-sized piece of abstract art in constant symmetrical motion. The art moves through itself to create unrecognizable shapes, with straight lines and sharp corners being favoured on a non-Euclidean plane. A cognitohazard was discovered after several minutes of testing with D-class personnel. Users who stare at the output for an extended period of time will begin to experience 3rd degree burns all over their body. The burn patterns resemble that of toaster heating elements.

**Input:** One electric blender circa 2019
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** As soon as the output booth opened, a large blade of a metal-plastic material rapidly accelerated out of the booth and embedded 3cm into the blast shield before detonating into razor-sharp fragments, injuring two security personnel and Senior Researcher Vivic. 

//Note: S.R. Vivic refused to stop testing for recovery, choosing to instead amputate his own right leg to avoid the many months of recovery time needed to heal from extensive shrapnel damage. By the end of the week, S.R. Vivic had already constructed and installed a prosthetic leg, and I quote, “Legs are easier to replace than arms, and I really didn&#39;t want to lay in bed for three months.” - Psychiatric Specialist Insano//

//Note: Your funeral. - R.A. Walker//

**Input:** One small toaster oven, circa 2008
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A sculpture of a metallic spider-like creature that, when touched, will play a random song at 60dB that always falls into the category of heavy metal and attempt to dance to said song until it ends. Testing so far has shown no other anomalous properties.

**Input:** One automatic can opener, circa 2010
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A head-mounted automatic skull opening device that operates via anomalous means and will, once activated, cut open an individual&#39;s cranium, exposing brain tissues without the subject feeling any pain or the need for anesthetics. 

//Note: If anyone needs a brain transplant I believe we found the perfect tool for the job. Or, you can use it along with a pane of thick glass to become a circus act or supervillain. - S.R. Vivic//

//Note: I will not be responsible for anyone’s brains falling out of their skulls. Incinerated. - Veritas//

**Input:** One air-fryer, circa 2018
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One hand-held hairdryer with a single control dial and no visible power source. The dryer appears to require no outside source of energy, while the dial has a maximum turn of 720° and once reached, the hairdryer will output wind of temperatures exceeding 350°C and speeds around 140km/h. While active, the outer plastic casing of the device does not change temperature in any way, nor is any recoil from the excessive air flow noted. Surrounding air needed for such outputted forces are not noted to have been sucked into the intake of the hairdryer.

//Note: Anyone need a hairdryer that might as well be harnessing the power of the Sun itself? - S.R. Vivic//

//Note: I’d try reverse engineer its heating mechanism to create a more efficient incinerator, but given that it will probably melt your face off if you accidentally twist the dial too far, I suggest incinerating it. - Intern Sora//

//Note: Those numbers were gained from it going on full blast. If the dial is barely turned, it is (mostly) safe to use on people. It could actually be used to make an infinite wind- or steam-powered generator of sorts. - S.R. Vivic//

//Note: Congratulations, Vivic. You have managed to create the anomalous counterpart to the H2O-9000. We’ll totally consider reverse-engineering it and placing it into active service. It’s been __incinerated__, as most outputs __ought to be__ after a test on Very Fine. - Security Agent Sedna//

**Input:** Above items
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A cup of salt water and a note reading &#34;salt water&#34;. The note has the cognitohazardous effect of making the observer say the chemical name of items and being unreasonably afraid of them for one hour. Note incinerated.

//Note: There is sodium chloride dissolved in that dihydrogen monoxide! Sound the hazardous materials alert! - AR King//

//Note: Why do three members of my staff sound like anti-vaxxers? - Veritas//

//Note: It&#39;s sorted out, cognitohazard. It sounds a lot scarier if you only use the chemical name, apparently. - Sedna//

**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** Melted plastic, a stack of torn cardboard.

**Input:** One doll. 
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One &#34;Ken&#34; doll. Accessories changed to ones normally included with a &#34;Ken&#34; doll.

**Input:** One doll. 
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** 1 &#34;Super Masculine Action Figure&#34;. Package shaped like a nuclear bomb. Accessories and clothing became weaponry and tactical gear, respectively. 

//Note: I want it to be on record that Action Figures are, in fact, not dolls. -Junior Researcher Townsend.//

**Input:** One doll. 
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Animate &#34;Barbie&#34; doll. Non-sentient. Tends to shift poses every few minutes, as if on a runway.

**Input:** One doll. 
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One changed doll. The parts remain plastic, but have a clockwork aesthetic. Package has the label &#34;914-chan&#34;. Clothing had &#39;&#39;setting&#39;&#39; panels embroidered in them, which were identical to SCP-914&#39;s settings. 

//Note: Incinerated, and the appropriate people were administered amnestics. - Veritas//

**Test 914-1266**
**Name:** Intern Sora
**Date:** 22/11/2019
**Total Items:** Two plastic globes, one fluorescent light tube (faulty), one tourist map of Hong Kong labeled with several points of interest, such as Victoria Harbour and Disneyland, among others.

//Note: I found these in the storage room in my house, might put them to some use. - Intern Sora//

**Input:** One globe 
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One plastic model of Mars. Several colonies are depicted on the model. Upon closer inspection, the colonies belong to the U.S., U.K., France, Brazil, China, Japan, India, Russia, and Iran. Olympus Mons is shown to be a condominium of all current members of the UN security council. Although Mars has a smaller radius than Earth, it retains the same size. --Non-anomalous--

//Note: Upon being placed into the incinerator, the D-Class handling the output reported feeling vibration from the model. Approximately 2 seconds later, lava starts flowing out of Olympus Mons. Lava measured to be at least 2000 degrees Celsius. D-class and Intern Sora are treated for burns. Item incinerated//

//Note: Okay. I’ll clean up the mess, kinda deserved it. - Intern Sora//

**Input:** One fluorescent light tube
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** An 18th-century style sabre. The blade is made from the glass, while the handle is composed of plastic. The blade scatters light differently, depending on the way a dial on the handle is turned. This effectively allows the blade to act as a prism that only allows one colour to pass through, and reflect the others.

**Input:** One map of Hong Kong
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One map of Chechnya

**Input:** One globe
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** An animate figure approximately 40 centimetres tall, recognised by Intern Sora as popular meme character &#34;Earth-chan&#34;. The figure walked out of the output booth and spontaneously combusted. Fire extinguished after exactly 2019 seconds. Remaining ash identified to be consistent with the product of combustion of plastic. Incinerated.

**Test 914-1267**
**Name:** Researcher MacLean 
**Date:** 22/11/2019
**Total Items:** One Smith &amp; Wesson Revolver, two window frames, one strip of LED lights with cord, two battery packs, one broken Smith Corona-brand typewriter, two Sets of ink ribbons, coil of wire, and 0.5kg of scrap metal.

//Note: I found these at a pawnshop, thought they would make interesting inputs. - Researcher MacLean//

**Input:** One Smith and Wesson Revolver
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A large key, designed to fit a lever tumbler lock. The main body of the key has been hollowed out. Twisting the handle of the key reveals an opening in which a .357 magnum round can be placed, and twisting the handle back to its original position fires the round. Object scrapped.

//Note: It was interesting but impractical. The thing dug into your fingers every time you fired it. - Researcher MacLean//

**Input:** One Smith Corona typewriter, two sets of ink ribbons, coil of wire, battery pack.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A typewriter with a hopper on the side. Placing objects in the hopper will result in the object being destroyed, and the component materials being imprinted on the paper in lieu of ink. The object is currently being studied in order to reverse engineer the disassembly mechanism. The typewriter was filled with ink when removed from the output booth.

**Input:** Two window frames, one LED light strip, one battery pack
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** Two similar window frames, with one being slightly smaller than the other. The battery pack and LEDs have been embedded evenly throughout both window frames. Entering one window will result in instantaneous transportation to the other window through an unknown mechanism. The object passing through the window will become slightly larger or smaller depending on which window is entered, due to what appears to be a compression of space-time.

//Note: During testing of the object, the smaller window was dropped into the larger window, beginning the creation of a fractaline structure. The structure appeared to not have enough pressure to finish the creation of the structure. Due to the non-converging nature of the pattern, it is theorized that excess pressure on the structure would cause either an explosive discharge of energy or the Schwarzschild radius would be exceeded, causing a black hole.//

**Addendum:** Upon discovering the status of the object, Researcher MacLean immediately entered the chamber it was currently held in, took the object, and left the site. Approximately two hours later an underground explosion was detected near Brewster, Florida. Investigation revealed a large sinkhole near the entrance of an abandoned mine shaft. Researcher MacLean was found unconscious near the wreckage. The explosion was reported up as a mine collapse, and witnesses were amnestized.

**Date:** 22/11/2019
**Total Items:** One list of actions to be done the next week, one list of actions that won&#39;t be done next week and one list of actions that might be fulfilled next week.

//Note: The next thing that might be interesting to examine is how will 914 react to a decision-based input so these lists contain things that I will do, won&#39;t do, and might do respectively. The &#39;&#39;might be fulfilled&#39;&#39; list contains actions that can be completed but if it will be done or not will be determined by a coin toss perform after this test concludes; I have a copy of all of the lists to maintain the parameters of the test. -Intern Regal//

**Input:** One list of actions that won&#39;t be done the next week.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One list of physically impossible actions. 

**Input:** One list of actions that might be done the next week.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One paper with many events of the life of intern Regal listed by date. According to the Regal, approximately half of them are correct.

//Note: I hope some of these are wrong, I don&#39;t think I could take the likes of &#39;&#39;gets set on fire on the way to the break room&#39;&#39;. - Intern Regal//

**Input:** One list of actions to be done the next week.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One piece of paper with the phrase &#39;&#39;What intern Regal will do today&#39;&#39; written on it. Once an action is written on the paper, intern Regal will immediately attempt to perform it and will not stop until it has been completed or an hour has passed.

//Note: While I was under the effect of this output, it felt like there was nothing more important than to finish that action. I&#39;m going to keep this output to improve my productivity and for the possibility that my physical integrity might be connected to its own. - Intern Regal//

**Input:** One pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A pocket watch that automatically adjusts for daylight saving time and for moving into different timezones. Notably, it always runs one hour ahead of the actual time.

**Input:** One pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A palm-sized grandfather clock. The clock always shows the current time in London.

**Input:** One pocket watch
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A pocket watch that --anomalously slows all movement-- slows the perception of time of the user by 15% within a fifteen meter radius for ten seconds, before it requires a 50 minute recharge. 

**Input:** One pocket watch
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A pocket watch that anomalously speeds the time perception of the user by 10%, before it requires a 50 minute recharge. 

//Note: Getting lazy, 914? - AR King//

**Input:** &#39;&#39;Speed&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Slow&#39;&#39; watches
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A metal ball with two clock faces and a button on it, the clock faces move at different times, one faster than normal, the other slower. When the button is pressed, it creates a fifty meter sphere of influence that speeds up perception of time inside of it by 80%. If the button is held, a fifty meter sphere is created once the button is released that seemingly stops all movement inside of it other than light. This effect lasts for a time equal to that the button was held. Item placed in anomalous storage.

**Total Items:** One 1cm cube of scandium, titanium, vanadium, chromium, manganese, and iron

**Input:** 1cm cube of scandium
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A 1mm×10cm× 10cm plate. When viewed, the subject seeks to find the nearest scanner, believing that they have found a lost document. Object has been taken to the parking lot and thrown into a crudely built crucible to be melted down.

//Note: I didn&#39;t have it thrown into the incinerator, due to my outputs frequently breaking the incinerator. R.A. Walker//

**Input:** 1cm cube of titanium
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A large paper clip made of titanium oxide. An attempt to use it as a paper clip caused the output to break.

**Input:** 1cm cube of vanadium
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A 10cm×10cm×1mm vanadium plate. The macro-etching resembles the Van Gogh painting &#34;Starry Night&#34;.

**Input:** 1cm cube of chromium
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A small chrome gear, with a flat stand at the bottom of one of the spokes.

//Note: This wouldn&#39;t seem out of place as a monopoly token. - R.A. Walker//

**Input:** 1cm cube of manganese
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A manganese coin, three centimeters across. It is decorated with images of gears and other clockwork mechanisms. On one side, there is an image of an unknown Russian man and some Cyrillic text translating to &#34;Super Setting&#34;, and on the other, an image of SCP-914 and text translating to &#34;Clockwork Token&#34;.

//Note: What could this mean? I was going to just leave it at that, but now, I&#39;m curious. - R.A. Walker//

**Input:** 1cm cube of iron, one &#34;Clockwork Token&#34;
**Setting:** Fine

//Note: As the input moved to the main chamber, the distinctive sound of a coin being pushed into an arcade machine could be heard, and the setting dial made two clicks, despite not having moved from the Fine setting. - R.A. Walker//

**Output:** One 2cm×5mm×1cm iron bar magnet. After testing, the bar magnet was found to have a magnetic field that inverts over ███ times a second. If placed in a coil of wire, [DATA EXPUNGED]. Object confiscated and destroyed.

//Note: So, it created [DATA EXPUNGED]. The clockworks made two clicks when the coin was inserted, and it made two clicks after the output booth opened. I think the setting changed, but the dial never moved. This item seems to be [REDACTED]. Veritas, I request that any &#34;Clockwork Tokens&#34; be confiscated if they ever appear again. I fear what would happen if someone used one of them with an input. - R.A. Walker//

**Test 914-1272**
**Name:** Intern Sora
**Date:** 26/11/2019
**Total Items:** Five fezzes 

**Input:** One fez
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** A pile of ash.

**Input:** One fez
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** A pile of shredded fabric.

**Input:** One fez
**Setting:** 1:1 
**Output:** A red fedora. 

**Input:** One fez
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One fez with a cognitohazard that causes whoever sees it to think that fezzes are cool. Effect disappeared 1 hour after eye contact ceased.

//Note: I&#39;d like to keep this fez. - Intern Sora//

//Note: Item incinerated. - Security Chief Sedna//

**Input:** One fez
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A purple fez, appearing to be made during the 15th century. Decoration consistent with styles popular in the Byzantine Empire. When worn, the wearer will gain perfect knowledge of the Thracian dialect of Medieval Greek and will be unable to speak any other languages. The wearer will also develop a hatred for the Turkish ethnicity, the Turkish nation and the Turkish culture. Wearer will insist on referring towns and cities in Turkey by their Greek name. Effect lasts 1453 minutes --and cannot be stopped--. Output incinerated. 

//Note: Κάποιος με βοηθήσει να παρακαλώ! - Εκπαιδευόμενος Σορα//

**Addendum:** Tests on D-class personnel shows the effect to be reversible through exposure to Turkish culture and language for 1922 seconds. Intern Sora was exposed to more than 30 minutes of Turkish music. Intern Sora then lost consciousness for 623 seconds before recovering.

**Test 914-1273**
**Name:** Assistant Researcher King
**Date:** 27/11/2019
**Total Items:** A standard office suitcase.

**Input:** Suitcase
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A suitcase that is linked to an empty pocket dimension. Upon coming in contact with AR King, the suitcase “bound” itself to him. The pocket dimension inside of the suitcase is unable to be opened by anyone other than AR King. The pocket dimension acts like a void, drawing all matter in the area towards the pocket dimension at high speeds until it is closed. This caused significant damage to the testing chamber. Unclear if the subspace can still be opened without the suitcase. Placed in anomalous storage.

**Test 914-1274**
**Name:** Researcher Darby, Research Assistant Walker, Intern Lunar
**Date:** 27/11/2019
**Total Items:** Sixteen industrial-use robotic arms

//Note: Got to use the dump truck again to carry these, got the arms from the same place I got the dump truck. - Researcher Darby//

**Input:** One robotic arm
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** One pile of scrap metal

**Input:** One robotic arm
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** One unorganized pile of disassembled components

**Input:** One robotic arm
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** One rusted robot arm, missing some components and lying on a pile of scrap metal; said pile of scrap is composed of metal fragments and is fairly painful to the touch.

//Note: Requesting more Band-Aids for the First-Aid Kit here. - Intern Lunar//

**Input:** One robotic arm
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** Multiple organized piles of components

**Input:** One robotic arm
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One robotic leg. 

//Note: Looks like it came off some sort cyborg limb. Give me another leg and I can make a Chicken Walker, though I probably need to find it some laser cannons to make it complete. - Researcher Darby//

//Note: Laser cannon? I wouldn&#39;t trust you with a water pistol, Darby. - Veritas//

**Input:** One robot arm
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One advanced prosthetic, which does not appear to fit a humanoid. 

//Note: Not the leg I was hoping for, but still pretty neat. Maybe the researchers at Medical can study this? - Researcher Darby//

**Input:** One robotic arm
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One autonomous arm, unpowered.

**Input:** One robot arm
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One swarm of miniature automatons, spider-like in appearance.

//Note: It seems like they would be used to assemble small- to medium-sized objects, but without any way to power them or control them, they are just paperweights. Sent to study and storage. - Researcher Darby//

**Input:** One robotic arm
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One metal spider; entity attempted to disassemble the nearest source of matter, which happened to be Intern Lunar. Security personnel present disabled said output. Sent to the labs for research and subsequent disassembly.

//Note: Spiders, why did it have to be spiders again? - Intern Lunar//

//Note: For his own safety and peace of mind, I&#39;m temporarily putting Intern Lunar on psychological treatment for his phobia. - Dr. Veritas//

**Input:** One robot arm
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One --sphere of metal-- AI core

//Note: Output was brought out of containment chamber by hand. However, when placed into a metal crate for transport, it assimilated the metal and used it to form interfaces that it used to communicate with nearby staff. The output requested political asylum as an SCP object until security destroyed the communication medium, silencing the core. The output was then placed in a foam case for transport and has been sent to the administration for review. - Researcher Darby//

//Note: I am disappointed that the AI&#39;s communication was disabled. I would have enjoyed finding out more about it. - R.A. Walker//

**Input:** Two robot arms
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One very large robot arm with extra functions. Some plastic has been taken from the shells of the inputted arms to form an instruction manual.

//Note: The instruction manual lists many features, though only a few have actually been installed on the output. Said features include plasma cutters, flamethrowers, manipulators of all sizes, welders, quantum adjusters, &#39;&#39;mana inscribing&#39;&#39;, and many more. Also, on the back is a liability warning, terms of service, and the logo of the Group of Interest known as &#34;The Factory&#34;.//

**Input:** Two robot arms
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One --unmarked steel cube-- Factory &#34;Black Box&#34;

//Note: Sent a D-class to pick up the output for once and it was a good thing I did so. The D-class attempted to pick up the box and it engulfed him, ticked for a minute, and released an android that closely resembled and in fact, seemed to be the D-class. The android was terminated and the box was melted in the incinerator after it was decided to be too much of a risk, even if it did not respond to non-organic material. Good thing Intern Lunar had been quarantined earlier, or else he might have been killed. - Researcher Darby//

//Note: I believe the term I heard for this process is &#34;roboticization&#34;. - R.A. Walker//

**Name:** Intern Sora
**Date:** 27/11/2019
**Total Items:** One plastic miniature model of a Liberty Ship

**Input:** One Liberty Ship model
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One miniature model of an Iowa-class battleship made of the same plastic, pennant number identified to be the USS Missouri. 

**Input:** Previous output
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One miniature model of a Ticonderoga-class missile cruiser, pennant number does not match with any built Ticonderoga-class cruiser.

**Input:** Previous output
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One miniature model of a Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier. Pennant number is not depicted. 

**Input:** Previous output
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One miniature model of an Imperial-class Star Destroyer. Output hovered out of output booth via anomalous means before suddenly accelerating towards the exit of Research Cell 109-B at speeds exceeding escape velocity for an object of the same mass. The output then crashed into a wall near the exit after suffering slight damage from sustained gunfire from security personnel present. Facility sustained minor structural damage due to the high kinetic energy of the impact. Five Facility personnel sustained minor lacerations injuries due to flying plastic shrapnel. Intern Sora, being the closest person to the output booth, sustained a mild concussion from the sonic boom.

//Note: It&#39;s still ringing inside my head after 5 hours. - Intern Sora//

//Note: Remains of output incinerated. - Security Chief Sedna//

**Test 914-1276**
**Name:** Dr. Meyer
**Date:** 27/11/2019
**Total Items:**  1 USB flash drive, 1 feather from the last output of Test 914-1083, 50 grams of calcium carbonate

**Input:** 1 USB drive
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** The same drive as inserted, now containing an unidentified program.

**Addendum:** A computer was set up with its own power supply and no access to the site’s network for this test. When the USB drive was inserted, the program it contained immediately started running, causing the PC to heat up until eventually melting down completely over the course of 1 minute.

//Note: Could be useful for sabotage. More testing on various types of computers would be useful. – Dr. Meyer//

**Input:** 1 feather, 50 grams of calcium carbonate
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** 1 egg, approximately 6 cm long and 5 cm wide. After being accidentally dropped by a member of staff, it was discovered that the egg contained another egg with the exact same proportions as the original output. The egg that emerged from the original output displayed the same anomalous qualities as well and the remaining egg shell disappears after approximately 1 minute.

//Note: It’s eggs all the way down… By the way, Lunar, do me a favor and make sure Jeff stays away from my bird. I’ve seen him lurking near my office and I really, really don’t want to know what happens if Ember’s ashes go through a cat’s digestive system. – Dr. Meyer//

**Test 914-1277**
**Name:** Researcher Connolly
**Date:**28/11/2019
**Total Items:** Two photographs, two letters, two flash drives containing an audio file each. Each piece of media depicts the same event, which is that of Researcher Connolly’s tenth birthday.

//Note: I’m curious as to the effects different media will have on the same historical event. On an unrelated note, yes, it is my birthday today. - Researcher Connolly//

**Input:** One photograph depicting a ten-year old Researcher Connolly, surrounded by his childhood friends, blowing out the candles on a birthday cake.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A photograph of SCP-914’s Output chamber. In the Output chamber is a birthday cake, with the icing saying “Happy 44th Birthday [REDACTED]!”

//Note: My 44th isn’t for a number of years. And how does it know my first name? - Researcher Connolly//

**Input:** One photograph
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A photograph, folded in half. Upon unfolding the photograph, it reveals a picture of a different SCP celebrating. Some of the SCPs include SCP-173 wearing a party hat, SCP-4999 blowing a party blower, a birthday cake made from various gears and springs (presumed to be SCP-914’s), and SCP-085 with a speech bubble saying “Happy Birthday!”. Item incinerated after one such opening revealed the silhouette of SCP-096 holding a birthday gift.

**Input:** One letter describing Researcher Connolly opening his birthday gifts.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** An origami bow. Upon holding the bow, subjects reported auditory hallucinations of cheering and the sound of party horns.

**Input:** One letter
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A letter on Foundation letterhead, dated 28/11/21██. The letter describes a plea for help by one M. Connolly, explaining how a terrible accident had caused him to [REDACTED] eventually [REDACTED] leaving him in the [REDACTED]. The letter ends with a harrowing warning, proclaiming [DATA EXPUNGED]. Item incinerated, Researcher Connolly admitted to the medical bay for mandatory amnesticization.

**Input:** One audio file
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** An audio file. Upon playback, produced a tone well above human hearing capacity but proceeded to cause a near system-wide power failure, resulting in the injuries of three researchers. 

//Note: I am to report to Dr. Veritas’ office immediately. This may be how it ends for me. - Researcher Connolly//

**Test 914-1278**
**Name:** WR Markham
**Date:** 23/11/2019
**Total Items:** One unloaded DP-12

**Input:** DP-12
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A model of the //Girls&#39; Frontline// character DP-12 (Helena) as a police officer. When held for over 12 seconds, all motion ceases for anywhere between five and thirty minutes, during which a first-person shooter game is played.

//Note: Further analysis shows that the game is a modified version of //Call of Duty//, with an extra playable character (Helena) assisting Captain Price. Said character is said to be a member of the SAS and a former assistant chief constable. Whenever the// Call of Duty //storyline ends for a player, a pop-up notification appears, saying &#34;Do you want to restart?&#34;. Clicking &#34;yes&#34; returns the game to the initial startup, while clicking &#34;no&#34; causes the game to become a modified version of// Call of Duty Mobile//, with all features of the game retained, but with all standard characters plus Helena being unlocked. The modified game is compatible with standard versions of said game. - WR Markham//

**Test 914-1279**
**Name:** Memetic Specialist White
**Date:** 26/11/2019
**Total Items:** Five greyscale Polaroid photographs of various parts of SCP-914

//Note: This is to test whether SCP-914 can recognize itself. - White//

**Input:** One greyscale Polaroid image of SCP-914&#39;s setting selector
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** N/A. SCP-914 refused to activate while the image was in the input booth even after the key was wound.

//Note: This is really interesting. As far as I&#39;m aware, this is the first time SCP-914 &#34;refused&#34; to change an object. Let&#39;s try the other settings. - White//

//Note: This is certainly interesting. Do note that SCP-914 has refused to operate before when one of its gears was removed for testing on itself. Don&#39;t try this if you don&#39;t want to be personally terminated. - Veritas//

**Input:** One greyscale Polaroid image of SCP-914, taken from the doorway of the testing chamber
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** N/A. SCP-914 refused to activate while the image was in the input booth.

**Input:** One greyscale Polaroid image of the interior of SCP-914&#39;s output booth
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A greyscale printed image of SCP-914, taken from the perspective of Security Camera 1 on 07/25/2008.

//Note: Now we&#39;re getting somewhere. However, this does beg the question of how 914 was able to obtain the image. - White//

**Input:** One greyscale Polaroid image of SCP-914, taken while D-4554 removes an object from the output booth
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A white piece of paper with no visible markings. Individuals who stare at the paper will invariably begin describing how &#34;beautiful that picture is&#34;. Descriptions of the image vary, usually being blurry, bright images of SCP-914 being used by D-4554.

//Note: I now feel like I know less about 914 then before I started. I recommend further tests regarding the potential intelligence of SCP-914. - White//

//Note: I wouldn&#39;t recommend further testing involving the Settings panel of SCP-914 in the future, even if it&#39;s just in a picture. We&#39;ve gotten mood and other panels before, so don&#39;t make my life difficult and yours shorter by doing something similar again. - Veritas//

**Test 914-1280**
**Name:** Intern Regal
**Date:** 29/11/2019
**Total Items:** One fire extinguisher capable to put out class A fires, one fire extinguisher capable to put out class A and B fires, one fire extinguisher capable to put out class A, B and C fires and one fire extinguisher capable to put out class D fires.

//Note: Since you can never be too careful, I’m going to test if we could get some improve fire extinguishers. - Intern Regal//

**Input:** One fire extinguisher capable to put out class A, B and C fires.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One unbranded fire extinguisher, capable of extinguishing fires of any type (chemical, electrical, etc). Any object in which the output has been used on will no longer be able to change its surface temperature, said temperature will be set after the fire has been extinguished. The fire extinguisher cannot be refilled.

**Input:** One fire extinguisher capable to put out class A and B fires.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One fire extinguisher that absorbs oxygen from the surrounding area when it detects any combustion in its proximity. The effects get more potent the more of the substance is present within a radius of 5m. Destroyed for risk of asphyxiation.

**Input:** One fire extinguisher capable to put out class A fires.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One fire extinguisher labeled &#39;&#39;Full discharge&#39;&#39;. Upon ignition of a liter of gasoline to test it, the object shot all of its contents (10L of pressurized water) in the direction of the fire, causing minor injuries on Intern Regal’s hand. Remains were found non-anomalous and incinerated.

**Input:** One fire extinguisher capable to put out class D fires.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One &#39;&#39;D-class&#39;&#39; fire extinguisher which has the anomalous effect that when used on any burning object in direct contact with a D-class will immediately extinguish it. This object will be impossible to reignite for the next 24 hours.

**Addendum:** Repeated use on a D-class has resulted in the subject believing to be impervious to fire and ignore any damage or pain caused. Expired 78 hours after testing due to unrelated testing, when he failed to notice a candle setting his garments alight.

**Test 914-1281**
**Name:** Intern Regal, Researcher Laskenta, Intern Snevets, D-30972
**Date:** 02/12/2019
**Total Items:** Three flash drives with a &#34;Clockwork&#34; executable program.

//Note: I have wanted to do a continuation of my algorithmic test, so Researcher Laskenta, Intern Snevets and I have spent some time making one algorithm that directly corresponds with how SCP-914 works with its settings. This program creates approximations to the results and it works by restricting the input to a set of pre-selected words that can be combined to form a sentence, before processing it according to the setting and giving a somewhat randomized result. To achieve this, we had to set up the logic, feed a learning algorithm some of the test logs that had consistent inputs or somewhat easily described outputs, expand the database of words and connexions available among others. - Intern Regal//

**Input:** One flash drive with a &#34;Clockwork&#34; executable program.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One flash drive with an executable program label &#34;Fine&#34;, resembling a copy of the input program with only the Fine setting and encrypted by unknown methods. The randomness of the outputs and complexity allowed in the inputs have been increased.

//Note: This is close to what I was expecting to get in my last algorithmic set of tests. I wonder if 914 encrypted it just to keep us from learning more about it. - Intern Regal//

**Input:** One flash drive with a &#34;Clockwork&#34; executable program.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One flash drive with an executable program written in an unknown language, seeming to require two more settings before it accepts an input.

//Note: Though the unknown language makes it impossible to confirm at the moment, I assume the two extra settings correspond to the &#34;mood&#34; and &#34;state&#34; dials that 914 previously had. - Intern Regal//

//Note: I&#39;m going to now try it on Very Fine. Any outputs will be recovered and tested by D-class due to the inherent risks of outputs from this setting. - Intern Regal//

**Input:** One flash drive with a &#34;Clockwork&#34; executable program.
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One flash drive with an executable program labelled &#34;EXE-914&#34; and a folder labeled &#34;Results&#34;. When the program is executed, a window appears displaying a virtual image of SCP-914 with the input booth open and the settings dial preset to 1:1.

Interacting with the settings dial allows the user to change it to Rough, Coarse, 1:1, Fine and Very Fine; interacting with the input booth causes a text box to appear with a button labeled &#34;Close&#34; and an option to upload a file from the computer the program been executed on.

The program allows the user to enter any sentence or paragraphs that pass the syntax and grammar checks. Once the &#34;Close&#34; button is pressed, the program shows an animation of many gears turning with the text &#34;Processing&#34; displayed. During this time, the &#34;Results&#34; folder cannot be opened, the program cannot be closed and the computer cannot be shut down by any known means, even when it loses power.

After a period of time between five to fifteen minutes, a system message indicating the finalisation of the processing will appear and a new file will be present in the &#34;Results&#34; folder. Said generated files can be text files, image files or executable programs; text files usually contain descriptions of physical objects, expressing their physical aspects as well as their properties. The program components are encrypted and no attempts to break the encryption have been successful thus far. Refer to the addendum for descriptions of generated image files or executable programs.

//Note: What surprises me the most is that even the machine code (the code that the CPU can process) is encrypted. With neither the encryption nor the key (which could be anomalous too), we aren&#39;t going anywhere with this. - Researcher Laskenta//

//Note: So far the results show that this program outputs are in the range of what you could expect from 914 itself. While any physical inputs just produce text descriptions, it gives a proper digital output when the input corresponds to an image and the processing of programs and other files do give us functional results, so long as they are not put through Rough or Coarse. - Intern Regal//

**Addendum:** After testing with images in the Very Fine setting, it was discovered that the 914 program can generate images with cognitohazard and infohazards. D-30972 has been sent to the infirmary and given amnestics.

//Note: Even though the program can produce some dangerous outputs, I request that we keep it for its possible benefits and the fact that it may allow us to do many physical tests that would be too dangerous to try on the actual SCP-914. - Intern Regal//

//Note: I&#39;m fine with you keeping it, but I don&#39;t think we should assume that this program behaves in the exact same way as the real SCP-914 would. On top of that, we don&#39;t actually have a way of testing it, since repeated tests produce different results. - Veritas//

//Note: I&#39;m going to try and determine the limits of the program. For now, to see where it does differ from SCP-914. Though the possibility that it might show us how it works if we decrypted it makes the option of putting it back in SCP-914 with some decryption software rather tempting. - Intern Regal//

**Test 914-1282**
**Name:** Intern Regal
**Date:** 29/11/2019
**Total Items:** Five printed pictures of a beagle dog, obtained as an output of the program EXE-914.

//Note: Continued testing with the program has shown a high risk of getting infohazards and cognitivohazards from text files and images respectively. This is one of the few safe outputs so it&#39;s going to be run through 914 to test for a possible notable reaction. - Intern Regal//

**Input:** One printed picture of a dog.
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** One pile of burnt paper.

**Input:** One printed picture of a dog.
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** The aforementioned picture which has been cut and reorganized to resemble the image.

**Input:** One printed picture of a dog.
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** --One picture of a Sphynx cat.-- One picture of a Persian cat which has the anomalous effect of been perceived by humans as a picture of a Sphynx cat.

//Note: The presence of a cognitohazard in a 1:1 output indicates there might have been another anomaly in the input. You should probably get the picture looked over again. - Intern Snevets//

//Note: SCP-914 might be treating it as a cognitohazard due to it coming from the EXE-914 program, which is the kind of interesting interaction that this test was trying to get. - Intern Regal//

**Input:** One printed picture of a dog.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One animated picture of SCP-999. When held it will cause the subject to begin laughing until contact its broken. While not being interacted with the output will appear to play or rest within the foreground.

//Note: What is this adorable little thing? I love it! Please tell me this is a real thing and I can meet it. - Intern Roman//

**Input:** One printed picture of a dog.
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One small animated dog made out of paper, it remained sitting down looking in front until a human interacts with it. The object would perform any simple command given, and upon completion would return to the default sitting stance.

**Addendum:** The output attacked Jeff the mugcat upon coming into the line of sight, but was terminated by Intern Luna before it could cause any harm. Remains found non-anomalous and incinerated.

-----
**Test 914-1283**
**Name:** Intern Regal
**Date:** 02/12/2019
**Total Items:** One flash drive containing the program EXE-914 and one flash drive containing multiple software capable of decryption.

//Note: After a lot of testing, we now know that the program EXE-914 has a 0% chance to produce infohazards or cognitohazards when working with the Rough setting, 15% when working on Coarse, 30% when using 1:1, 60% on Fine and 90% on Very Fine. With these kinds of numbers and after some discussion with the researchers, it was decided that it would be better to attempt decrypting the program with SCP-914 rather than keeping it and creating more problematic outputs. - Intern Regal//

**Input:** One flash drive containing the program EXE-914 and one flash drive containing multiple software capable of decryption.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One flash drive containing an anomalous program that automatically removes the necessity of passwords or credentials in any software --place in the same folder.-- accessible from the computer executing the program.

**Addendum:** Due to the possibility of an information breach, the output has been incinerated after it automatically decrypted several files on the Foundation database. Intern Regal has voluntarily taken amnestics after reading information above his clearance level.

**Test 914-1284**
**Name:** Researcher Laskenta; D-48838
**Date:** 02/12/2019
**Total Items:** Five notes, which read different statements; five pencils

//Note: We had some friendly discussions in the break room since Researcher Connolly brought tea to the coffee table. And since some statements have been proven by esoteric math, I decided to give 914 a go. After all, 914 is all about interpretation. -Laskenta//

**Input:** A note, reading [[$ Tea &gt; Coffee $]], and one pencil
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A note, reading [[$ Tea \lesseqgtr Coffee $]], and one pencil

**Input:** A note, reading [[$ Tea \stackrel{?}{=} Coffee $]], and one pencil
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A note, reading [[$ =Coftea? $]], and a small mug, made from the materials of the pencil. Due to the fragility of the mug, its handle has been broken by the D-Class while they inspected it.

**Input:** A note, reading [[$ \iiint Tea = Coffee $]], and one pencil
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A small folded paper cube. The faces show the letters C-O-F-F-E-E respectively. The cube can neither be opened nor be damaged by any known means. Different attempts to look inside the cube have met with inconsistent results, all of which are related to tea (e.g. the word &#34;Tea&#34; written all over the inside, or an anomalously floating representation of tea leaves made from paper). One used pencil.

//Note: Attempts to look into the inside of the cube included bright light, X-rays, and N-rays. -Laskenta//

**Input:** A note, reading [[$ (Coffee~Table \nVdash Coffee) ∧ (Tea \stackrel{∧}{=} Coffee) $]], and one pencil
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A pencil with a note attached to it, which reads [[$ C \not\subset \not\supset T $]]. Trying to mix Tea and Coffee in the same room as the output will lead to both fluids disappearing upon contact with each other. The output will anomalously reform itself after being destroyed or disassembled, when unobserved.

**Input:** A note, reading [[$ (Coffee \not\equiv Tea) ∧ (Tea ≣ Coffee) $]], and one pencil
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A note, reading [[$ \{Coffee, Tea\} \nexists $]]. Tea NOT PRECEDE LOGICAL OR NOT SUCCEED Coffee. Coffee, Tea INFINITY.

//Coffee: Objects NOT CONTAIN AS A MEMBER THE SET OF Coffee, Tea. Coffee PROPORTIONAL TO Tea NOT PARALLEL TO this. - Tea//

//Note: Wait what? There&#39;s must be something wrong, let me try again. - Intern Sora//

**Input:** Previous output
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One USB containing the FPS game &#34;Player Unknown BattleGrounds&#34;

**Input:** Previous output
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One USB containing the action-adventure game &#34;Grant Theft Auto V&#34;.

//Note: Somehow 914 managed to store a 65GB game in a 8GB USB stick. - Intern Sora//

**Input:** Previous output
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One USB containing the strategy game &#34;Hearts of Iron 4&#34;, made by the same studio that created the &#34;Europa Universalis&#34; series. Output undergoing testing by Intern Sora.

//Note: Yes, that&#39;s what I wanted. - Intern Sora.//

**Addendum:** A computer was set up in the preliminary test room with a dedicated power source. The game managed to run at maximum performance despite the computer being well under the minimum setup required. --No other anomalous effects observed.--

--**Addendum:** It was found that after Intern Sora achieved victory as Nazi Germany in 1943, the timeline of the world is altered as if the Third Reich and its allies were victorious in WWII. Notably, the U.S. is divided between Germany, Japan, and a fascist Mexico; Dr. Veritas no longer works in Facility 23 as he is currently researching methods of weaponising anomalous output from SCP-914; S.C. Sedna is conscripted into the Wehrmacht and the Foundation is being infiltrated by agents from both the Chaos Insurgency and the SS, which seems to have allied with each other. Effect was reversed after Intern Sora completed a game and achieving victory as the U.S. in 1945. Intern Sora seems to be the only person who is aware of memories from the alternate timeline.--

**Addendum:** Questioning of other personnel involved in said alternate reality and inspection of the software itself revealed that, upon finishing a game the game will display a cognitohazard that causes the player to think that they are transported to a version of a alternate reality based on the outcome of the game. The USB and computer are incinerated.

//Note: Intern Sora has returned to the medical bay and requested amnestics. - Medical Staff Skipper//

**Test 914-1287**
**Name:** Intern Sora
**Date:** 02/12/2019
**Total Item:** 1 pair of reading glasses

//Note: I want to try and see if 914 can fix my glass frame for me, so I&#39;m skipping rough and coarse.  - Intern Sora//

**Input:** Reading glasses, lens made of glass
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A pair of glasses, lens made of black, opaque silicon. A gas cloud of pure oxygen is detected in the output booth.

**Input:** Previous output
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A pair of glasses. Lens are transparent despite being made entirely of silicon monoxide, possibly due to unknown arrangement of silicon monoxide crystals. 

**Input:** Previous output
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A pair of binoculars. Binoculars can zoom in up to 10 million times to observe molecular-sized objects. 

**Input:** Previous output
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A pair of binoculars, lens are able to convert light into a single frequency through anomalous means. The zoom dial is now replaced by a dial that sets the converted frequency, ranging from radio waves to gamma rays. D-class personnel instructed to look through the binoculars is now under treatment for radiation poisoning. Item placed in anomalous storage.

**Test 914-1288**
**Name:** Intern Snevets
**Date:** 02/12/2019
**Total Items:** 0.5 m^^3^^ scrap metal, 450 cm^^3^^ beach sand, two liters of seawater.

//Note: Took a trip down to the beach over the weekend. I brought back a few things to test with. The seawater is sterilized, before anyone asks. - Intern Snevets//

**Input:** 0.1 m^^3^^ scrap metal, 150 cm^^3^^ silicon
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A simple clock. Does not function properly due to friction between gears.

**Input:** 0.2 m^^3^^ scrap metal, 150 cm^^3^^ silicon
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A set of ten ornate copper-plated steel throwing knives. Exited the Output booth at approximately 30 m/s and successfully pinned attending D-Class to the opposite wall. No injuries, D-Class dismissed and a replacement brought down before testing resumed.

//Note: Heavy, but usable. And they look nice, too. Requesting permission to keep these. - Intern Snevets//

//Note: Your usage of the word &#39;&#39;usable&#39;&#39; earned you a negative, there. Placed in anomalous storage. - Veritas//

**Input:** 0.2 m^^3^^ brass, 150 cm^^3^^ silicon, 2 liters sea water
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A chassis of an unknown model of autonomous machine. At the core is a sealed glass object, later found to contain a previously unknown species of radiolaria, suspended in a nutrient solution with an electrical current running through it. Radiolaria believed to have come from dead bacteria and other small biologics found in the water.

//Note: Interestingly, these radiolaria appear to be in some way integral to the functioning of this robot. Removing them causes it to cease functioning. They also appear to be capable of feeding off their own waste, explaining how they can survive in such a small closed system like this. - Intern Snevets//

//Addendum: Further testing has revealed that the radiolaria are capable of independent locomotion. When placed in a fluid outside the chassis, they form small clouds and &#34;tendrils&#34; with a defined edge, and search for the chassis. It is currently unknown what purpose this serves.//

//Note: We managed to get a computer hooked up to this thing&#39;s central processor, and it&#39;s rather interesting what we&#39;re seeing: It&#39;s simulating us. This thing is simulating us. It&#39;s about an hour ahead, and it has managed to depict every Staff member and general personnel down to the quantum level. Actually, down to particles smaller than any quanta currently known. In the past 24 hours, it hasn&#39;t made a single mistake. And seeing as it&#39;s outputting an existing video format, I can only assume that it simulated us linking it to a computer and adjusted its output to match. Its processing power must be immense, given the scale of the simulation. I&#39;ll need to thank Hackett for giving me time off to join the lab staff on this. - Network Technician Rare//

//Addendum: Item and radiolaria have been incinerated following its misuse to view several female personnel changing. The offending Staff member has been terminated.//

**Test 914-1289**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Reimer
**Date:** 02/12/2019
**Items:** Three copies of SCP-1762&#39;s documentation, a drawing of the Devil&#39;s Trident

**Input:** A copy of SCP-1762&#39;s documentation
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A copy of SCP-1137&#39;s documentation

**Input:** A copy of SCP-1762&#39;s documentation
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A descriptive list of all extinct vertebrate species and other members of their corresponding genus

//Note: As one of the genuses mentioned also corresponded with that of SCP-1128 (and was listed by its binomial species name), Junior Researcher Reimer has been administered with Class-C amnestics. - Veritas//

**Input:** A copy of SCP-1762&#39;s documentation

**Test 914-1290**
**Name:** Prof. Wren
**Date:** 02/12/2019
**Items:** Three Polaroid 600 flip-up cameras, each loaded with a roll of self-developing film

//Note: As great as modern photography is, there&#39;s just something satisfying about these old things. -Prof. Wren//

**Input:** A camera, flipped open.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** The camera, shut, alongside a series of photos of the camera from a variety of angles sitting atop a large gear.

//Note: I&#39;m intrigued as to how 914 managed this, though not surprised. -Prof. Wren//

**Input:** A camera, flipped open.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A rifle scope with a &#34;magazine&#34; containing the undeveloped film slats and a button on top. Pointing the scope at an object and pressing the button simultaneously captures a photo of the object and sends it flying away from the scope at speeds measured at approximately 16m/s. Reloading the &#34;magazine&#34; with other compatible film produces the same result.

//Note: The D-class administering the test was terminated after attempting to snap a photo of Dr. Veritas. He didn&#39;t realize he was holding the scope backwards and blasted his own eyeball out the back of his head. Yuck. -Prof. Wren//

**Input:** A camera, flipped open.
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** The camera, shut, along with photos of various facility personnel. People not among those photographed were unable to open the camera back up. When one of the persons photographed attempts to hold the camera, it flips open to reveal a mouth lined with extremely sharp teeth and attacks. Object destroyed and remains incinerated.

//Note: We found out about the &#34;camera mimic&#34; when Darby decided he&#39;d, quote, &#34;give it a whack.&#34; Fortunately, the stupid thing&#39;s bite strength wasn&#39;t enough to pierce __too__ deeply into flesh, so he&#39;ll be alright. I dealt with the problem by throwing the book at it. Literally. Our SOP does not qualify as &#34;light reading&#34; by __any__ metric. -Prof. Wren//

//Note: Really, they should just give it out as an electronic book. Site-19 alone probably chewed through an entire forest making copies for everyone. - Intern Snevets//

**Test 914-1291**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Kai
**Date:** 02/12/2019
**Total Items:** One copy of the source code for the game //I Love You Colonel Sanders: A Finger Lickin&#39; Good Dating Simulator// uploaded to a thumbdrive, labelled with notepaper

//Note: Over the weekend, I looked through the previous tests in Experiment Log 914 and had a thought... why aren&#39;t we using SCP-914 to get completely original concepts? For lack of a better choice of input, here we go. - J.R. Kai//

**Input:** Above item
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** (Presumably) one copy of the source code for &#34;I Love You SCP-914: A Very Fine Dating Simulator&#34; uploaded to a storage device, similarly labelled with notepaper. Unfortunately, the storage device is now completely non-functional due to the input connection being of unrecognisable design.

//Note: Of all the tests to switch the storage device around, this test? Specifically today? Not any other test? Are you actually kidding me? Seriously? Why? Why would you do this to me? - J.R. Kai//

//Note: Junior Researcher Kai was forcefully escorted from Research Cell 109-B after attempting to throw his clipboard at SCP-914. All researchers are reminded that SCP-914 is an extremely delicate and valuable object and should not be subjected to wilful damage by all personnel. He has been disciplined for this incident. - Security Chief Sedna//

**Test 914-1292**
**Name:** Researcher Darby
**Date:** 04/12/2019
**Total Items:** Four miniaturized PWR units, nine CBRN suits

//Note: Darby is testing with nuclear reactors? I&#39;ll be extremely far away from here if you need me. 
- Prof. Wren//

**Input:** Two CBRN suits
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** Torn remnants and fragments of the input (950 rem detected)

//Note: My Geiger counter is going crazy, so it&#39;s a good thing I brought some radiation suits for everyone involved. - Researcher Darby//

**Input:** 1 CBRN suit, 1 PWR unit
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** One heavily damaged and corroded suit, one leaking and damaged PWR unit

//Note: Thankfully, it seems that the radioactive portion of the system is still intact, so no radiation was detected. Going to have the D-class deal with the mess. - Researcher Darby//

**Input:** Two CBRN suits, one PWR unit
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One HazMat suit, one clean-room suit, one BHWR

//Note: That reactor doesn’t work. Sure, it generates power, but it consumes far more material for the same amount of power as a normal PWR unit would. - Researcher Darby//

**Input:** One CBRN suits, one PWR unit
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Two suits of unknown make and origin. Further testing reveals that they are impervious to all environmental conditions, contain an internal cleansing unit, and are resistant to firearms and physical damage. One sphere with a high wattage output and concealed control panel. When placed in water, the sphere outputs 3 Gigawatts/hour but was destroyed when water breached the power transfer unit and caused a power shortage.

//Note: I am going to yell at the technicians for a while and then ask for MT Johnson to be available in the future. He would have noticed the wear on the cable and replaced it, and we would still have the, uh, power sphere. - Researcher Darby//

**Input:** Two CBRN suits, one PWR unit
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One large mechanical spider. The PWR unit has been reshaped into the thorax with the coolant system acting as the circulatory system. The spider&#39;s spinnerets produce cables which can be used to power most systems, except branded systems used by some manufacturers. Due to an outer layer of CBRN material acting as chitin, the object is immune to most environmental hazards and can expand the material on its legs to act as a sealed tent. Due to a complete lack of sentience, compounded by the remote found embedded in the pincer analogues, the object has been sent to labs for study, clearing, and possibly reverse engineering to act as mobile support for MTF units.

//Note: Researcher Darby has been sent to the medbay when his leg was broken during his attempt to maneuver the object out of the containment cell. - Medical Technician Ollins//

//Note: Who let Darby have access to radioactive material? - Researcher Dross//

//Note: I just received an e-mail the size of a novella as to &#39;&#39;why a mechanical arachnid built by an SCP is a horrible idea&#39;&#39; from MTF Captain Jules. I was surprised someone actually thought it was a good idea, until I noticed that Darby sent the request. - Veritas//

**Test 914-1293**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Kai
**Date:** 06/12/2019
**Total Items:** Three copies of the source code for &#34;I Love You Colonel Sanders: A Finger Lickin&#39; Good Dating Simulator&#34; uploaded to three separate thumbdrives, all labelled with notepaper

//Note: Counselling sucks. I&#39;m going to try again. Before we begin, I&#39;m really sorry, 914, for trying to attack you yesterday. - J.R. Kai//

**Input:** One thumbdrive
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** (Presumably) one copy of the source code for &#34;I Love You Captain Silver: A Fishy Dating Simulator&#34; uploaded to an unchanged thumbdrive, similarly labelled with notepaper. Unfortunately, the source code is not executable due to incompatibility with all known operating systems.

**Input:** One thumbdrive
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** (Presumably) one copy of the source code for &#34;I Love You Wendy: A Fresh And Never Frozen Dating Simulator&#34; uploaded to a floppy disk, similarly labelled with notepaper. Unfortunately, the floppy disk is unreadable due to adhesive residue from the notepaper.

//Note: I&#39;m removing the notepaper for the last one. If it doesn&#39;t work... - J.R. Kai//

**Input:** One thumbdrive
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One copy of the source code for &#34;I Love You Ronald McDonald: A Dating Simulator You&#39;ll Love&#34; inscribed on over seventy sheets of various flattened sheets of metals in extremely miniaturised text.

//Note: You can&#39;t stop me, 914. Permission to borrow a light microscope and projector from the labs? I&#39;m going to take a few days off work for this... project. - J.R. Kai//

//Note: Just looking at J.R. Kai as he copies the source code is giving me a headache. - Researcher Darby//

//Note: Data corruption needs to be considered when transcribing the source code from such miniscule text. - Intern Regal//

//Note: How certain are you that the source code as printed on the seventy sheets are stacked in that particular order? There&#39;s another three codes that could make complete sense. - Junior Researcher Reimer//

//Note: Permission to attempt to fix the floppy disc and run it? - Researcher Dross//

//Note: It&#39;s been a few days since I&#39;ve copied the source code onto a computer. I just completed the game and I&#39;ll be honest... it&#39;s a shameless marketing stunt for McDonald&#39;s. Is 914 actually receiving advertising fees for this? - J.R. Kai//

//Note: Did Kai actually manually copy source code using a microscope? I didn&#39;t know we employed personnel this psychotic. - Lab Technician Morton//

//Note: Morton, don&#39;t call your colleagues psychotic. Kai... This isn&#39;t mandatory, but I recommend having you examined by the on-Site psychiatrist for signs of... something. - Veritas//

//Note: Well that was a big letdown. I can&#39;t believe I wasted all that time helping to copy the code just for it to be a massive advertisement... - Intern Snevets//

**Test 914-1294**
**Name:** Prof. Wren
**Date:** 06/12/2019
**Total Items:** 3 32GB USB flash drives, each loaded with 2 copies (1 for Windows, 1 for MacOS) each of the visual novels &#34;Hatoful Kareshi&#34; and &#34;Hatoful Kareshi: Holiday Star&#34;

**Input:** One drive.
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One flash drive, loaded with 2 copies (1 for Linux, 1 for [REDACTED]) of &#34;Foundations of Love,&#34; a visual novel described in the readme.txt file as being modeled on various SCPs. No anomalous properties were found.

//Note: The flash drive was incinerated when we saw that SCP-096 was the basis for one of the characters. I don&#39;t care how good that game could have been, not worth the risk. -Prof. Wren//

**Input:** One drive.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One flash drive, loaded with 31.8GB of .png images of various species of birds, including //columba livia// (common pigeon) and //alectoris chukar// (chukar partridge). An anomalous property was discovered wherein viewing the photos induced romantic and/or sexual feelings within the viewer.

//Note: Went ahead and incinerated this one as well. That...was just weird. -Prof. Wren//

**Input:** One drive.
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A small plastic/metal bird, identified as a miniature fantailed pigeon. Upon the output booth opening, the pigeon ran across the floor at speeds over 45km/h. Pigeon was later found in the break room ineffectively stomping on a packet of [REDACTED]-brand pudding. Pigeon went inert 4 minutes later and has remained inactive since.

//Note: Why am I surprised? -Prof. Wren//

**Test 914-1295**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Pines
**Date:** 06/12/2019
**Total Items:** One mason’s hammer, one kilogram of marble, a dossier on SCP-914.

**Input:** Above items
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:**  A marble replica of the front of SCP-914, with a 2x2x2 cm cube in its input booth. When the marble key is turned, the input booth closes and the output booth opens, despite the lack of a mechanical connection to the key, revealing a smaller marble replica of 914. It is unknown how many times this process can occur. The mason&#39;s hammer is slightly damaged, presumably from use.

**Input:** Previous output
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A marble bust of Dr. Veritas with the Foundation motto of &#34;Secure, Contain, Protect&#34; written on the plaque in Dutch.

//Note: Does that mean 914 sees him as his equal? - Junior Researcher Pines//

//Note: &#34;Veilig, Detineren, Beschermen&#34; somehow doesn&#39;t have the same ring to it. Neither does &#34;VDB-914&#34;. - Researcher Connolly//

**Test 914-1296**
**Name:** Intern Scott
**Date:** 04/12/2019
**Total Items:** Three HB pencils

**Input:** One HB pencil
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One #2 pencil

**Input:** One HB pencil
**Setting:** Fine 
**Output:** One visually unchanged HB pencil that increases in length as you sharpen the end, although it grows thinner.

//Note: The pencil is currently 50cm long. - Intern Scott//

**Input:** One HB pencil
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One frictionless HB pencil

//Note: Can I keep this? - Intern Scott//

//Note: Who took my pencil? - Intern Scott//

//Note: Is this some sort of prank? Who left a pencil here on my desk that can&#39;t be used? - J.R. Kai//

//Note: Why did I see a pencil just slide past my office chased by a bunch of Interns? - Researcher Darby//

//Note: The pencil kept gaining momentum and smashed into the concrete cafeteria wall. We destroyed the remains remotely, since we don&#39;t want to risk zero-inertia splinters. - Veritas//

**Test 914-1297**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Pines
**Date:** 06/12/2019
**Total Items:** One kilogram of wood, one carving knife

**Input:** One kilograms of wood, one carving knife
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** Twenty-five toothpicks in a container, presumably molded from the carving knife. The container is labeled &#34;914-Brand Toothpicks&#34;. Small print at the bottom states, &#34;Use the code on the back and get a copy of //I Love You SCP-914: A Very Fine Dating Simulator// for free!&#34; No code is present anywhere on the container.

//Note: Kai is going to love this. - Junior Researcher Pines//

**Test 914-1298**
**Name:** Intern Regal
**Date:** 06/12/2019 
**Total Items:** One EOD robot equipped with a standard foundation camera and one lux meter, three flashlights, two camping lanterns, five 300 Watts light bulbs, and one chess set.


//Note: After some consideration on how would I evaluate my last hypothesis I read through the logs to see if there was any way to get consistent outputs from the rest of the settings and I found out that [http://www.scp-wiki.net/experiment-log-914/offset/8  914 plays chess in 1:1]. 
Since the ELO of 914 has been determined, this experiment will try to determine the level of improvement, if any, that different Illuminance may cause. The same setup as last time will be used to achieve each Illuminance and the computer will begin with an ELO of 1000 and it’ll be adjusted according to 914 record against it. - Intern Regal//

**Input:** Chess set with the pieces set up for the start of a game.
**Setting:** 1:1
**Illuminance:** 1000 lux
**Output:** The above input, with White pawn moved to a legal position.

[Following moves removed for brevity]

**Input:** The above output, computer moved the Black King to a legal position leaving mate in one for 914.
**Setting:** 1:1
**Illuminance:** 1000 lux
**Output:** The above input, White Queen moved to a legal position, checkmate.

//Tests 2-20 results removed for brevity//

//Note: With a 13-5-2 result it shows significant improvement when compared to the baseline results. Another notable thing is the use of the scotch opening instead of the four horses as it did when previously tested.
Moving to 15000 lux and an ELO of 2000. - Intern Regal// 

**Input:** Chess set with White pawn to e4 as indicated by the machine.
**Setting:** 1:1
**Illuminance:** 15000 lux
**Output:** The above input, with Black pawn to e5.

[Following moves removed for brevity]

**Input:** Previous output, computer moved Bishop takes the pawn on f7, check.
**Setting:** 1:1
**Illuminance:** 15000 lux
**Output:** The above input, Black king placed sideways, taken as surrender.

//Tests 22-41 results removed for brevity//

//Note: The results ended up 19-0-1 with the only defeat cause by the machine using Capablanca’s response to the Marshall’s gambit, after that, it was a pretty one-sided affair. I will install a better chess program to see if we can get the approximate ELO of 914. - Intern Regal// 

//Note: After using many programs, Deep Shredder 13 with an ELO above 3000 was able to consistently defeat 914. These results support the idea that an increase in light will improve 914’s processing capabilities, so to speak. Even so I can’t think of a way to test it consistently on Fine or Very Fine, still a more potent Fine test might be interesting to conduct, though anyone who wants to attempt it will have to be cautious of 914 usual tendencies to mess with us. - Intern Regal//

**Test 914-1299**
**Name:** Dr. Cleveland
**Date:** 06/12/2019
**Total Items:** One CD copy of the debut Sabaton album //Primo Victoria//

**Input:** //Primo Victoria//
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A copy of the Paradox grand strategy game //Victoria II//. Testing showed that the game has more subdivisions and countries matching up the starting year. Players are anomalously compelled to play in a manner that would result in a Polish colonial empire, a United States that does not cross the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers, and an Ireland that is no larger than the Irish speaking regions in 1850.
