**Special Containment Procedures:** In the event that SCP-7203 becomes misaligned with foundation goals, it is to be relocated to any foundation site currently held in time stasis to prevent unwanted decommissioning before research and full utilization of the anomaly is complete. In any scenario where transport of SCP-7203 becomes unfeasible within the time before SCP-7203&#39;s decommissioning due to its status as a Khonsu[[footnote]]the Khonsu containment class denotes an object which is subject to imminent destruction due to uncontrollable circumstances [[/footnote]] class anomaly, the use of experimental Burleson-Lockingweigh localized time locks is authorized. The defense of SCP-7203 against outside forces seeking to capture it or otherwise impede its pre-determined actions is imperative. 

**Description:** SCP-7203 is the designation given to Senior Researcher William Conwell who, at some point during his service in the Anomalous Chronology Department, gained the ability to manifest it&#39;s future choices and decisions ahead of time. SCP-7203 is capable of relocating items from further along the timestream to points in time pre-dating their existence. These objects will not manifest within view of any recording device or sentient spectator. The anomaly is not capable of transmitting objects larger that 3 feet in any direction. This effect appears similar to manifesting an object into existence, which resulted in the initial misdiagnosis of the entities anomalous properties. SCP-7203 has maintained its alignment with foundations goals and values and is currently working with foundation researchers to garner a better understanding of the potential causes and effects of its anomalous traits. Due to SCP-7203&#39;s impact on events that have not yet occurred, it is possible that previously theorized upon paradoxes may occur. If this possibility is realized, a BVK-Class universal timeline superposition scenario may occur, resulting in the total collapse and ultimately the superposition of our current timeline. 

The cause of SCP-7203&#39;s sudden attainment of the aforementioned anomalous traits has been heavily debated by leading researchers in the Anomalous Chronology Department. Popular theory held in the department is that SCP-7203 will invent a device capable of transporting humans to different points along space-time. The theory states that SCP-7203&#39;s abilities stem from its current decisions to utilize his &#34;time machine&#34; to perform acts along time stemming from the point at which he invented the device. If this theory is to be believed true, SCP-7203&#39;s current anomalous properties would cease to exist following the point at which he invents the time travel device.

Â **SCP-7203 INTERVIEW LOG**
&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-7203 
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; **Interviewer:** James Sino, Chronology Dep.
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; **Foreword:** Following personal discovery and confirmation of its own anomalous attributes, SCP-7203 promptly reported itself to James Sino, the head of the Department of Anomalous Chronology. 
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt;

&gt; **Sino:** Will, I am going to need as much information as you can give me right now. If what your reporting is true, this is an extremely serious matter. 
&gt; 
&gt;

&gt; **SCP-7203:** Alright, let me give you a full breakdown of the phenomena as I understand it. Essentially, I am able to manifest various small items in a similar manner to a reality bender. Curiously however, the objects I decide to manifest always appear out of my field of vision. 
&gt; 
&gt;

&gt; **Sino:** And you gathered this information through unauthorized testing before even reporting it to your superior?
&gt;
&gt;

&gt; **SCP-7203:** Well, I suppose yes, but I only tested it on my own to ensure that I could effectively control this anomaly as to not bring any harm to others unintentionally. 
&gt;
&gt;

&gt; **Sino:** I have no doubt that you did that with the safety of your coworkers in mind, but unauthorized testing is malfeasance that is normally met with disciplinary action. 
&gt;
&gt;

&gt; **SCP-7203:** I am willing to face the consequences of my actions, but in this situation the best course of action would be to garner a greater understanding of the limits to my abilities. In fact, I would like to put forward a request for immediate SCP classification. 
&gt;
&gt;

&gt; **Sino:** Good grief William, you know that is a very sudden thing to just spring upon me. I will have to forward your request to a RAISA operative before it even gets considered. 
&gt;
&gt;

&gt; **SCP-7203:** I eagerly await the results. Until then, I have to ask that you hold off on disciplinary action for the time being.
&gt;
&gt;

&gt; **Sino:** That would be standard procedure, yes.
&gt;
&gt;

&gt; **SCP-7203:** Excellent. That will be all then, thank you for your time.
&gt; 

&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** SCP-7203&#39;s request for SCP classification has been reviewed and accepted by RAISA, testing is still necessary to determine Conwell&#39;s exact level of containment. Upon request, junior researcher Henry Orion has been appointed project lead.

**INITIAL TESTING LOGS**
__**Test 1A - 01/10/19**__
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Purpose:** Ascertain exact specifications and extents of SCP-7203&#39;s supposed abilities, and tangibility of summoned objects. 

**Procedure:** SCP-7203 was directed to manifest a coffee cup within the site cafeteria, and then fill it with water. SCP-7203 then commanded to ingest water from the cup. 

**Results:** Upon being instructed, SCP-7203 entered a brief trance-like state. Cameras placed in the site cafeteria detected a faint shimmer of blue light coming from within the male lavatory. Due to the absence of cameras within the restrooms, the phenomena was unable to be recorded. Following this, SCP-7203 made its way to the site cafeteria and retrieved the cup from the lavatory, completing the test without issue. The coffee cup manifested did not hold any anomalous properties, nor did any water ingested from within it, but notably had a design from a Disney film that had not yet been released. 

**Analysis:** 2 things about this experiment have garnered my attention: The coffee cup design, and the manifestation within the male bathroom. Something tells me that there is more to SCP-7203&#39;s abilities than previously suspected. Another round of testing should confirm this. - Henry Orion, Project Lead
[[/div]]

__**Test 2A - 01/11/19**__
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Purpose:** Follow through regarding the out-of-sight manifestation of the coffee cup during the previous test. 

**Procedure:** SCP-7203 directed to first summon a brick within a closed chamber which only he was within, and then summon a brick in a room covered with surveillance equipment. 

**Results:** SCP-7203 went through with the first part of the experiment as directed, and noted a shimmer of blue light from above him in the ceiling rafters. However, by the time he looked up to observe the phenomena, the brick had already completely manifested and the blue sheen had disappeared. Said brick proceeded to fall off of the rafters and directly onto the face of SCP-7203. SCP-7203, however, reported that the brick was light as a foam brick despite seemingly being fabricated out of shale and clay. Later composition analysis of the brick discovered the presence of air, as well as an unknown gaseous substance that dissipated into the air when the brick was dismantled. 

After being hit with the brick, SCP-7203 proceeded with the second half of the test and successfully manifested another brick within the surveillance chamber. Upon the initiation of the blue shimmer, all cameras placed into the room experienced heavy interference and were unable to record non-corrupt footage of the event. Summoned brick was retrieved and more carefully analyzed, revealing the summoned brick to have a much higher tensile strength than a standard construction brick. Gaseous substance was found to almost immediately solidify into a neigh unbreakable material when exposed to pure oxygen, but still retain its light weight. Synthesis of the materials required to create the gaseous substance has begun. 

**Analysis:** So my hypothesis appears to have been correct, and SCP-7203 manifested objects cannot be observed whatsoever. What concerns me more, however, is the pattern I am beginning to notice with said objects seemingly modified in some way. I have my own ideas about why this might be, but I will wait to share them until I can confirm their credibility. - Henry Orion, Project Lead
[[/div]]

__**Test 3A - 01/12/19**__
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Purpose:** Ascertain the exact nature of objects manifested via SCP-7203.

**Procedure:** SCP-7203 is asked to manifest a standard Apple brand iPhone, of the most recent make and model. 

**Results:** SCP-7203 successfully manifests an object, with the characteristic blue shimmer emanating from a nearby vent. SCP-7203 walks over and pulls off the vent cover to retrieve the object, which is revealed to be a singular contact lens, although its exact purpose was not immediately obvious. SCP-7203 is then instructed to wear the lens, to which it begrudgingly accepts and places the lens upon its right eye. SCP-7203 is momentarily stunned and stumbles backwards, exclaiming that an interface akin to a mobile phone is being projected in front of him. The alleged interface is not present on any of the recorded footage, and is assumed to be projected directly onto SCP-7203&#39;s right eye. SCP-7203 takes a moment to calm down before explaining that it is able to interact with the holographic interface using his mind, although he remarks that there is a setting to instead use eyes to interact. After a few moments, SCP-7203 identifies the device layout to be most similar to that of an iPhone, and navigates to the settings app (which has had its icon replaced with circuitry, where there was previously clockwork). Within the application, SCP-7203 ascertains that the device is an &#34;iLens 4&#34;, released in 2039 alongside the previous 3 models. 

**Analysis:** My personal theory has been proven correct once again, as it would seem that SCP-7203 is only capable of manifesting objects from the future. Now, with all this evidence compiled, I am excited to reveal my hypothesis on the true nature of SCP-7203. You should be able to find it within the next addendum, as I plan to convene with my peers at the Anomalous Chronology Department. - Henry Orion, Project Lead

**ANOMALOUS CHRONOLOGY DEPARTMENT MEETING TRANSCRIPT**

**Date:** 1/14/19

**Subject:** SCP-7203

**Meeting Lead:** Henry Orion

**Meeting attendees:** Department Head James Sino, Senior Researcher Jeremiah Smith, Senior Researcher Abigail Holmes, +37 ACD staff 
-----

[BEGIN LOG]

//The video log opens with most of the ACD staff already seated in the conference room, and as the remaining personnel shuffle in, Henry Orion turns on a projector and stands up to begin speaking.//

**Henry Orion:** This is our former co-worker, SCP-7203.

//Orion presses a button on the projector to begin the slideshow, the first slide being a photo of SCP-7203//

**Henry Orion:** Or as many of you already know it, William Conwell.

//The room erupts into confused and worried discussion regarding this development. Orion clears his throat and begins speaking again once the room succumbs to tense silence.//

**Henry Orion:** I understand that this information comes as a shock to many of you, as SCP-7203 desired to keep this secret until the true nature of his anomalous properties were discovered, which is what I am here to discuss with you today.

//Orion switches to the next slide, which displays the three items manifested by SCP-7203 during the initial testing phase.//

**Henry Orion:** Can someone tell me what these three objects have in common?

//Tory Spanier, who is undergoing his foundation internship at the Department of Anomalous Chronology, raises his hand to answer the question.//

**Henry Orion:** Yes, Spanier?

**Tory Spanier:** Sir, these objects are all things seen and used in daily life.

**Henry Orion:** To the untrained eye, yes, however these objects hold a far greater importance than it may seem at first glance.

//Orion switches to the next slide, which displays the same three objects, but this time complete with overlaid captions which point out the abnormalities in each object.//

**Henry Orion:** As you can all see, there is another common pattern in all of these objects. None of them come from our time, carbon dating has revealed that the objects show no signs of atomic decay and I believe that they will resume the natural process of carbon decay when the time comes that they were pulled out from. 

**James Sino:** You don&#39;t mean to imply th-

**Henry Orion:** Yes I do, James. My research has found that SCP-7203 is pulling objects from points in time that have not yet occurred for us. Not only that, but the method SCP-7203 uses to accomplish this is both shocking and time sensitive.

//The room once again returns to an unorganized heap of confused murmurs.//

**Henry Orion:** Please, calm yourselves, we aren&#39;t 5 years old. 

//A collective murmur of agreement from the crowd before silence once more.//

**Henry Orion:** SCP-7203 is actually not anomalous. However, SCP-7203 is destined to create the world&#39;s first &#34;time machine&#34;, which is going to prove revolutionary for this department.

**James Sino:** And what is your evidence for this claim?

**Henry Orion:** It has been a long standing belief by this department that the future is in a super-fluid state, and is only solidified when it becomes the present. However, the construction of a time machine is a monumental event which would&#39;ve always happened since its creation at that point in the future. In other words, its creation would cause time to solidify around that point. And in even simpler terms, the creator of the time machine would be able to make decisions about how to use it in the current time, and have their future self carry out those actions.

**Henry Orion:** For instance:

//The projector switches to a video displaying an excerpt from an interview with SCP-7203//

**Recording of Orion:** So, what process do you go through when conjuring an item? Are there any limitations imposed on your ability?

**Recording of SCP-7203:** Well there really isn&#39;t much to it. I just tell myself that I was to bring an item here, and then a couple seconds later it appears with that flash of blue light. To answer your second question, I can&#39;t seem to summon anything larger than a mini-fridge. When I try, nothing happens, no blue light or anything. It&#39;s almost like I am telling someone to manifest objects using my own thoughts.

//Recording ends//

**Henry Orion:** It is very clear to me that what SCP-7203 does when summoning an item is making a promise to itself to relocate an object from the time of the time-travel devices creation to some point further down, or hypothetically further up the time stream. 

**Henry Orion:** I think the implications are very clear. We are all aware of the bootstrap paradox, and the potential consequences lest it be left violated. My proposal is this: we continue to study SCP-7203 until it creates the time-travel device, then allow it to fulfill the guidelines of the bootstrap paradox to prevent a BVK-Class event. I will be taking questions now, as I imagine you all have many.

[END LOG]

**Post meeting overview:**
The proposal to continue monitoring and studying SCP-7203 as well as allowing it to create the time-travel device when the time comes has been accepted by James Sino. Tests conducted following the interview have begun to narrow down the time at which SCP-7203 will create the device, and a list of all items needing to be transported back along the time-stream has been assembled.
