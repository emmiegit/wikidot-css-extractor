In order to simplify downvoting for common reasons, and to make it feel less personal, I have created:

**SCP Foundation Standardized[[footnote]] This is a joke, not standard, and should not actually be used in the Forums. However, all the reasons listed for downvoting things are 100% real. Do not mail this form to the IRS. Do not taunt Happy Fun Ball. [[/footnote]] Downvote Form 1040-EZ**

I am downvoting your SCP because: (check all that apply)

[ ] You forgot to spellcheck.
[ ] You forgot to proofread.
[ ] You did not read, or decided to ignore &#34;How to Write an SCP.&#34;
[ ] You posted an incomplete SCP to the main site.
[ ] Your formatting is incorrect.
[ ] You do not know the difference between its/it&#39;s; your/you&#39;re; there/their/they&#39;re.
[ ] I am not sure if you know how to write in English.
[ ] There is a severe deficiency in clinical tone.
[ ] You appear to have accidentally posted an article intended for the Shark Punching Center (SPC).
[ ] Self-upvotes are bad form; don&#39;t do that.
[ ] If you had posted your idea in the Forum, 20 people would have told you not to write it.
[ ] If you had posted a draft in your sandbox, 20 people would have told you not to post it on the main site.
[ ] Your SCP is too much like SCP-__, and is not written well enough to get away with it.
[ ] Your SCP is a straight rip-off of __. 
[ ] Your SCP is on the Cliche List, and is not written well enough to get away with it.
[ ] You need to send your D &amp; D monster/artifact/magic item/cursed magic item back to the Forgotten Realms.
[ ] Rape is just not a good SCP topic/effect.
[ ] Neither is necrophilia.  Your SCP should keep me up at night, but not because I&#39;m wondering when you&#39;ll be arrested.
[ ] There is no hook.
[ ] Meh.
[ ] It just didn&#39;t grab me; sorry about that.
[ ] Your -J isn&#39;t funny.
[ ] Your -J is really just a bad mainlist SCP.
[ ] Your &#34;Keter&#34; SCP is just dangerous, not interesting.
[ ] The Description area doesn&#39;t describe your SCP.
[ ] If your SCP &#34;appears to be&#34; an X, it should not actually be an X.
[ ] I had to read half of your SCP before I could figure out what it does.
[ ] I read your entire SCP and still don&#39;t even know what it IS.
[ ] You [REDACTED] part of the containment procedures.
[ ] You [REDACTED] an entire incident report.  Just because [[[SCP-087]]] did it doesn&#39;t mean you should. 
[ ] You [REDACTED] your main effect.  Just because [[[SCP-231]]] did it (more or less) doesn&#39;t mean you should.
[ ] You [REDACTED] the hook.
[ ] You [REDACTED] other things in a way that is silly.
[ ] You keep using the word &#34;memetic.&#34; I do not think it means what you think it means.
[ ] Your SCP compels people to use it for no reason.
[ ] Your SCP is just a __ that kills people.
[ ] Your SCP is just a __ that makes the user crazy.  Or makes them crazy and then kills them.
[ ] Your &#34;real life&#34; SCP is less interesting than the real thing that it is based on.
[ ] Your SCP is a lame attempt to explain: [ ] Katrina [ ] Fukushima [ ] Tsunami in Indonesia [ ] (some other real-life disaster)
[ ] The dialog in the interview log makes all of humanity look like complete morons.
[ ] The lack of common sense by all characters portrayed makes me want to light fire to my computer.
[ ] Your SCP enters a &#34;rage state&#34; and you were not writing about it visiting New Jersey.
[ ] The story of how your SCP was found is unbelievable.
[ ] You included writings translated from an ancient language ...that somehow still rhyme in English.
[ ] Please remove:
-- [ ] the incorrectly-edited title
-- [ ] the boring test log
-- [ ] the boring supplemental pages
-- [ ] the non-metric measurements
-- [ ] the lolFoundation addendum
-- [ ] the &#34;Tags&#34; that you made up yourself
-- [ ] the Telekill reference
-- [ ] the crosslink to SCP-173/500/682/914 (circle as appropriate)
-- [ ] the random/excessive references to Clef/Bright/Gears/Rights/Kondraki/(insert other misused &#34;canon&#34; character here)
-- [ ] the lame joke about sharks and/or bees
[ ] Your SCP breaks my suspension of disbelief. Specifically, because of:
-- [ ] Incorrect science
-- [ ] Technobabble
-- [ ] Anachronisms
-- [ ] The combat scene that should have &#34;Yakety Sax&#34; playing in the background.
-- [ ] an Agent finding the SCP: on his doorstep/in a weird little shop/on the beach while vacationing/(insert ridiculous story here).
-- [ ] Other:
[ ] Your SCP has a containment area that is:
-- [ ] a vastly-oversized cube
-- [ ] 2-dimensional
-- [ ] 6-dimensional
-- [ ] made of titanium (or other inappropriate materials).
-- [ ] excessively specific for no reason
-- [ ] nonexistent; the SCP is allowed to wander around the site. 
[ ] The containment procedures make no sense, or are completely inappropriate to what the object does.
[ ] Your SCP is only &#34;uncontainable&#34; because you were too lazy to think of something.
[ ] Your humanoid SCP is:
— [ ] an &#34;X-Man&#34; or super-villain.
— [ ] just another D &amp; D monster.
— [ ] a bad self-insert/&#34;Mary Sue.&#34;
— [ ] something really obvious from another medium, in SCP form.  Slenderman, this means you.
— [ ] using the Foundation like it was a hotel.
— [ ] getting what it wants because we wouldn&#39;t like it when it&#39;s angry.
[ ] Your picture is:
— [ ] A hand-drawn &#34;artist&#39;s impression&#34; of your SCP.
— [ ] 27MB, and hosted off-site.
— [ ] Something another SCP already uses.
— [ ] Completely different from what is described in the text.
— [ ] A movie still, or some other well-known thing.
— [ ] Watermarked.
— [ ] Borked.
— [ ] Obviously computer-generated.
— [ ] Too photoshopped.
— [ ] Not photoshopped enough.
— [ ] Not photoshopped at all, but looks photoshopped.
