Heh.  It&#39;s funny. I always tell my boys, don&#39;t give your life fer the Foundation. Make some other bastard give his. But here I am. Fuckin&#39; hypocrite, that&#39;s what I am. But nobody ever promised me retirement, so that&#39;s okay.

I figure I got another ten minutes before they make it through the door. Closest backup is fifty miles away, an&#39; I know Barnes ain&#39;t gonna make it to &#39;em in time. Hey, Barnes, if yer still listenin&#39;, you better make it, you fuckin&#39; asshole. You hear me?

This place is gonna blow pretty soon. There are plenty of safety protocols in one of these plants, but I&#39;m an engineer. I know exactly the wrong things to do an&#39; in what order. I don&#39;t know just when, but it&#39;ll take out a good chunk of the countryside when it does. Wait &#39;til after before you come in. There ain&#39;t time for anyone to come get me. Nobody&#39;s gettin&#39; outta here alive, if I have anything t&#39;say about it. Got one last bullet, an&#39; damned if I&#39;m gonna waste it on those assholes.

So, I don&#39;t know who else can hear me. Fuckers broke the receiver, but so far as I can tell, the transmitter&#39;s still good. So, I wanna say somethin&#39; to the rest of you.

We are the ones who save the world. Not the doctors, not the council, no one else. Us. We&#39;re the last line of defense. The only line. Remember that. Don&#39;t die for the Foundation. Don&#39;t fight for the Foundation. Fight for the six billion folks who won&#39;t wake up tomorrow if you don&#39;t. That&#39;s worth dyin&#39; for. Some old fart wants to play with skips? He can go fuck himself.

You ain&#39;t machines. You ain&#39;t tin soldiers. You&#39;re people, men an&#39; women who do the shit nobody else can do. An&#39; people make a choice. There&#39;s a damned big difference between doin&#39; the job because you were told to, an&#39; doin&#39; it because it&#39;s gotta be done. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s the same fuckin&#39; job, there&#39;s a goddamned difference. There&#39;s gotta be, or what the hell else are we fightin&#39; for?

An&#39; I want you to remember, each and every one of you, that you ain&#39;t alone. You understand? None of us are ever alone. We got each other. Every agent that&#39;s alive is there t&#39;watch your back. No matter what happens, you&#39;re one of us. Doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re a saint or an asshole, you&#39;re family. You got hundreds of brothers an&#39; sisters right there in the shit with you, ready to pull you out.

An&#39; when you&#39;re alone, you&#39;re still not alone. Every agent who came before, every one who&#39;s comin&#39; after you, they are with you. Everyone you ever trained with, everyone who&#39;s watched your back or bitched to you at meals is with you. You carry them with you, so long as you remember that you ain&#39;t alone. And you pass that on to everyone you meet. When we die, we deserve to know that we ain&#39;t alone. No matter what happens. We got each other.

Oh, an&#39; one last thing. I&#39;m proud of ya. If we ever worked together, no matter what else I said to you, I&#39;m proud of you. Even if I ain&#39;t never laid eyes on you, just for doin&#39; the job, I&#39;m proud of ya.

It&#39;s been an honor, guys. An&#39; when you come in, if this don&#39;t finish &#39;em off... Give &#39;em hell for Max Lombardi.</textarea></pre>
