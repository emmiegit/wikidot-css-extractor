[[div]]
SCP-7432 must not be removed from 17 Cromwell Street, London until the Foundation of TL-7432 does so independently. The discovery of SCP-7432 on September 9, 1999, must not be averted or delayed. SCP-7432 must be present at Site-115 on February 26, 2188, alongside SCP-23049 (of TL-7432), which must undergo an Oblique Event on that day.[[footnote]]For further information on Oblique Events, see: [[[SCP-23049]]] (TL-7432).[[/footnote]] Chronology Department personnel must avoid and avert any actions or events which may significantly alter these events. The annual documentation of SCP-7432 must be regularly reviewed to identify unexpected historic alterations.

A temporal tracking device must be incorporated into every spatial tracking device the Foundation of TL-7432 attaches to SCP-7432. The temporal tracker attached to SCP-7432 on February 26, 2188, must be Model XRTD-MCD/IV, regardless of inferiority and/or redundancy. The whenabouts of SCP-7432 must be constantly monitored to ensure the item is returned to TL-7432 by February 26, 2188.

Further containment procedures enacted by the Foundation of TL-7432, varying by era, are available on request and must be complied with.

++ Description
[[/=]]
[[div]]
SCP-7432 is a small trapezoidal keystone approximately 15 centimetres in height, 11 to 16 centimetres in width and depth, and weighing 7 kilograms. The item appears to be comprised entirely of granite; due to its secondary anomalous function, samples cannot be safely obtained to confirm this and/or discern the origin of the granite. The front face of SCP-7432 is engraved with a triskelion,[[footnote]]A Neolithic symbol of uncertain origin, consisting of three interconnected spirals.[[/footnote]] surrounded by a ring of glyphs of unknown origin.

The primary anomalous property of SCP-7432 manifests when it is held against, or used as, the keystone of an arched doorway with a functional door. If a subject touches SCP-7432 while imagining a desired location, the opened door will lead directly to the location; the only known limitation to potential destinations is that they must possess at least the same three spatial dimensions as baseline reality. SCP-7432 can otherwise be used to access any cognisable location, including alternate time periods and timelines, altered states of reality, and locations with subjective correlation to concepts.[[footnote]]E.g. ‘somewhere I can be happy’ may lead the subject to a location containing elements they will perceive as enjoyable.[[/footnote]]

The secondary, passive property of SCP-7432 is its central role in a temporal loop, present only in TL-7432 and thus serving as the timeline’s distinguishing feature:
* **February 26, 1606:** SCP-7432 manifests in a delivery of stone in the Cromwell Street construction yard, resulting in its misuse as the keystone for 17 Cromwell Street, London’s front entrance. The error is not corrected.
* **September 9, 1999:** Resident Adam Loe returns to 17 Cromwell Street intoxicated; he accidentally triggers the item, transporting himself to his hometown of Bingara, Australia. SCP-7432 is subsequently discovered by the Foundation, relocated to Site-115 for containment, and replaced with a non-anomalous replica.
* **February 26, 2188:** SCP-23049, while stored at Site-115, undergoes its 9th Oblique Event, coincidentally displacing SCP-7432 to the year 1606 under the exact circumstances of its manifestation.
As a result of this, SCP-7432 is never physically created, possesses no discernible origin, and undergoes no permanent alterations across the entirety of its functionally-infinite existence; investigating Chronology Department personnel suggest this lattermost aspect may be due to an unrecognised regenerative property, however testing cannot be conducted to confirm this due to the potential creation of a temporal paradox.

+++ Containment Failure
[[/=]]
[[div]]
An unknown influence is causing SCP-7432 to demanifest from TL-7432 on March 21, 2009, preventing the temporal loop from being resolved. However, TL-7432 is not undergoing an expected total temporal collapse; the events of February 26, 1606, through to March 21, 2009, continue unaltered, including the paradoxical existence of SCP-7432.[[footnote]]As SCP-7432 cannot be displaced from February 26, 2188, it cannot manifest on February 26, 1606, and thus logically should not exist at all.[[/footnote]] Following the demanifestation of SCP-7432, TL-7432 is spontaneously replaced by an unidentified, metastable branch timeline designated TL-7432-!.

The temporal tracker of SCP-7432 is transmitting from within TL-7432-!, suggesting that SCP-7432 is remanifesting in a potentially recoverable state. Task Force Ora-4 is being dispatched to recover SCP-7432 if able, and document the contents of TL-7432-!.
