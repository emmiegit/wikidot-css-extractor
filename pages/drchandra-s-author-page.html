I joined the SCP community back in August of 2014. I learned about it from a [[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOnB2fWQz0w |youtube video listing popular creepypastas]]]. I&#39;ve wondered if I ever would have discovered the Foundation if not for that one video. The internet is vast, after all.

      **First Attempts:**
Like most newbies, my first post was a failure. It was an SCP called the Polyocculus. It was a short scrawny humanoid whose skin was filled with holes like that of a Surinam Toad&#39;s. It would steal people&#39;s eyes and shove them into the holes because it was terrified of going blind. I was going for a little trypophobia and taking a common fear, fear of disability, and ramping it up to insane levels. It got deleted for being a horror movie monster.

Next was a little Fairy Statue that I called the Mneumonic Device that prevented amnestics from working within a mile. It got deleted as well. I had a few more ideas over the next couple of years that I at least had drafts for or got feedback on but never posted. There was a stupid tale about 096 that involved idiotic cross testing, a lolfoundation termination log for 096 (which somehow got made into an [[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfsjBKt-3lA| SCP illustrated video]]] and seemingly partially inspired [[[consequences and collarbones]]] ), and an anomalous copy of Nobody Poops But You that caused anyone who read it to believe exactly that, which was too silly for the mainlist but not silly enough for a -J.  

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/new-job |New Job:]]]**
I did not have a successful article until June of 2016, when I posted New Job. Honestly, this is just a silly headcanon I had and I&#39;m surprised it&#39;s as highly rated as it is. It is currently my highest rated article (though it is neck and neck with [[[SCP-4040]]] at the moment), but it has the benefit of being nine months older than anything else I&#39;ve posted, so I wouldn&#39;t call it my best. I actually completely agree with most of the negative criticism the article has received. But as my first post, it was proof that I could create successful articles.

This now has a reading by TheeSherm, which you can find [[[https://youtu.be/o-ucpc59wtc |here]]].  

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/crunch-is-a-beautiful-sound |Crunch is a Beautiful Sound:]]]**
When I saw there was a 173 contest, I immediately wrote down my headcanon about it inside of a bare-bones framing device and cold posted it. Crunch is a Beautiful Sound was the result. I believe this is my most divisive article, since as of the time of this writing it has 55 votes and an aggregate score of 27.

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/osteotronic-cubes-vxy33-f7rq3-9xad1 |Osteotronic Cubes:]]]**
This was inspired by the tale [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/iris-dark |Iris Dark]]]. I just started wondering what happened after this tale, so I wrote an MC&amp;D format piece about it. I was pleasantly surprised by how well this did.  

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-dark-web-dke79-o2rg5-4jlw6 |The Dark Web:]]]**
&#34;What are you doing?&#34; 
&#34;A sequel.&#34;
&#34;... I don&#39;t understand.&#34;
&#34;Yeah me neither, but we pretty much nailed it the first time.&#34;

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/micky-d-s |Micky D&#39;s:]]]**
&#34;Yeah, I&#39;d like to get a 10-piece McNugget and a bunch of the Szechuan sauce. Like, as much as you&#39;re allowed to give me.&#34; In all seriousness, this was actually inspired by me seeing the letters McD on a McDonald&#39;s cup. 

**[[[Text Message in a Bottle | Text Message in a Bottle:]]]**
&#34;It’s a bad phone. Chuck it. I downgraded to a clamshell for emergencies only.&#34; 
My piece for the [[[siabhub | dickbottle canon]]].

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/kaiju-caviar-ocn39-t5fg6-7hjl2 |Kaiju Caviar:]]]**
My MC&amp;D format for Stormbreath&#39;s War on all Front&#39;s Canon.

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3903 |SCP-3903, Fata Morgana:]]]**
This is my first successful non-Herman Fuller SCP, and that was pretty much my motivation for writing it. I just thought that the Fata Morgana mirage was ripe for skipification, and the story developed from there.

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/document-3477-2 |Supplement SCP-3477-2:]]]**
This is my first and only supplement at the moment. I really loved stormbreath&#39;s scip [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/SCP-3477|SCP-3477]]], and I started compiling a list of all the different ways someone could live forever whenever I happened to think of them. When I had enough for all 34 instances of SCP-3477, I e-mailed stormbreath and asked if they&#39;d be interested in a supplement page.

**[[[SCP-3806 |SCP-3806, I AM AWAITED IN VALHALLA!:]]]**
Inspired by the opening line of CGP Grey video, and named after a battlecry from Fury Road. 

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/habil-and-qabil |Habil and Qabil:]]]**
Just a weird idea I let sit around for over a year, and finally decided to post when DrMagnus posted an SCP/MLP crossover. That&#39;s right.

**[[[Utter Depravity | Utter Depravity:]]]**
A short mystery tale I made up on the fly for Jamcon2018. Gave me a chance to expand on the Utterly Bazaar a little bit and set up a D&amp;C tale. First appearance of Ed of  Ed and Al&#39;s, as well as one of Metaphysicians&#39;s Aristocrats, which I love.

**[[[A Foul Storm in a Fair Land | A Foul Storm in a Fair Land:]]]**
Another Jamcon2018 entry. Like the first one, it probably never would have existed if not for the contest. I set it in the War on All Fronts Canon, detailing the final moments of Hy-brasil&#39;s King. I enjoy writting about the Fair Folk, and may produce other such works in the future.

**[[[SCP-3189 | SCP-3189, For The Man Who Has Everything:]]]**
Don&#39;t have much to say about this one. Basically, it&#39;s a wishing machine built by a sad wizard that Darke screwed over. 

**[[[Updated Amnestics Guide | Updated Amnestics Guide:]]]**
Exactly what it says on the tin. I never really like the original guide, so I wrote my own and decided to post it as an alternative head-canon. There&#39;s a tacked on narrative at the end because I felt obligated to do so, but I agree that the story&#39;s not the best. 

**[[[SCP-3277 | SCP-3277, Speak Softly And Carry A Big Stick:]]]**
Inspired by a walking stick I own, I decided to make an SCP about wizard staffs that are kind of crappy, and how MC&amp;D could still make a buck off them.

**[[[The Kaiju Sea | The Kaiju Sea:]]]**
My First Serpent&#39;s Hand Format, written for Doomcon2018 as part of Team Mikasa.

**[[[SCP-3549 | SCP-3549, Sweet Medieval Bitcoin:]]]**
Another SCP based on my version of MC&amp;D, and inspired by 049-J, or at least the image djkaktus links too in the author post. 

**[[[SCP-3619 | SCP-3619, You Spin Me Right Round, Baby, Right Round:]]]**
Since I write a lot from the perspective of a GoI that actively harbours anomalies from the Foundation, I decided to reverse that perspective and make a Freak who was happy he escaped from the Circus and ended up in Foundation custody.

**[[[mcd fidget winners | &#39;Fidget Winners&#39; (FDG43/W1NR3/5SLA2):]]]**
I&#39;m out of Rick and Morty quotes that would make sense for these. 

Ihp showed me a draft for these things, and I liked it so much I made an MC&amp;D format to go with it. 

**[[[Over thinking the Rainbow | Over(thinking) the Rainbow:]]]**
Some people just want to forget the Pride Logo Fiasco. I won&#39;t let them. 

**[[[SCP-4040 | SCP-4040, At The Bottom of a Bottomless Pit:]]]**
My SCP-4000 contest entry came in at 15th place out of 70 or so entries at the time voting was closed, and is currently my highest rated article on the site. Considering my SCP-3000 entry was quickly voted to deletion, I call that progress.  

This was inspired by the ending of the first [[[Black Autumn hub| Black Autumn series]]], which I was the foremost beta reader on, and in turn inspired [[[rise of the pit sloth hub | Black Autumn II]]]. 

**[[[slice of life | Slice of Life:]]]**
This was an idea that just came to me, and I decided to write it mainly because it&#39;s unlike anything else I&#39;ve done on this site and presents an interesting look at D-class. It does have a sequel, but that was just written for a contest. 

**[[[clef excerpts|Excerpts From &#34;How To Survive When Reality Doesn&#39;t&#34;, by Alto Clef:]]]**
I mentioned this in the tale &#34;A Circus Come to Not&#34; and someone suggested I should make it its own thing.

**[[[somatic backups | &#39;Somatic Backups&#39; (SOM64/B2DI5/3GYO7):]]]**
MC&amp;D format I wrote to cap off Darkstuff&#39;s Vend-a-Friend series, which he was kind enough to tie into Dread &amp; Circuses. 

**[[[SCP-4202 | SCP-4202, Sleepy Clappy Sleep Aid:]]]**
My attempt at a short, simple, Series I style magic object. 


**[[[SCP-4309 | SCP-4309, Huddle With Us:]]]**
Creepypasta monsters! 


**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-indestructible-man| Herman Fuller Presents: The Indestructible Man]]]**
SCP-4680 mentioned an indestructible circus freak. What choice did I have?


**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/mcd-smart-hex | &#39;SmartHex&#39; (SMR82/HJ0EX3/4DNV9)]]]** 
More of Iris being a badass.

**[[[The Great Shucks of the Unnamed Lords]]]**
Second Serpent&#39;s Hand Format, written for JamCon2019. 


**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/dread-circuses-hub |Dread &amp; Circuses:]]]**
But of course, what I&#39;m best known for is Dread &amp; Circuses. I explain on the hub page why I started that series, so I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll repeat myself here. The first entry in this series was only my second successful post on this wiki, but over a relatively short time span I&#39;ve generated a surprising number of successful chapters. I&#39;m very grateful to PeppersGhost for creating Herman Fuller&#39;s Circus of the Disquieting, otherwise I may never have found such a niche.
