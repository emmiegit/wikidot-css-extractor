Ah, hello there. 

No, don&#39;t get up. Put down the gun though, it won&#39;t do anything. I&#39;m not real, how could you shoot me? There we go. See, isn&#39;t that much nicer? All friends. Face that window, please. Oh, and smile. There, that&#39;s good.

You look surprised, doctor. You&#39;ve been on a binge of me, haven&#39;t you? I like your style, you fall down and you just get back up! Shame, though, that&#39;s what let me in. Nice couch. Don&#39;t get up, I&#39;ll make myself at home. What are you talking about, doctor? Oh, no, I&#39;ve not come here as some sort of vengeful retribution. I really don&#39;t mind you people watching me, although I do wish you&#39;d share them. You&#39;re very selfish, taking me away from the children like that, you know. 

I admit I did lose my temper for a bit back there, didn&#39;t I? Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve come to terms with my new audience. You do let me at children quite often. Some people would call you monsters! Not me, I don&#39;t judge. I&#39;m fair.

Haha, what are you writing? I&#39;m very sorry, doctor, but this isn&#39;t an interview. I&#39;d put it in the trash. There we go. Everything goes in the trash eventually. You trash your //precious// interview, the children trash their little minds and even I had to trash some of my other gimmicks. Oh, yes. I&#39;ve been making little savages for quite a while now, doctor. Put down the gun.

I think I started off small, the idea of fire some stupid cavemen got into their skulls. Children didn&#39;t really have time for me back then, so I moved on. The skinwalker shtick though, that was a good idea. Children whispered about me in the dark, adults even //painted// me! I hardly had to do anything at all!

But then you had to get clever, didn&#39;t you? Suddenly all those superstitions started to float away and I had no children to help, no parents to... well, you&#39;ll find out soon enough. And yet, there was one little form that I had left, one fun-loving character that could still reach inside those kids&#39; heads and //twist//. I&#39;m talking, of course, about Bobble the Clown. Oh, don&#39;t look so glum.

Smile. You&#39;re on television!

&gt; --As of ██/██/20██, it appears [[[SCP-993]]] has ceased broadcasting.--
&gt; 
&gt; As of ██/██/20██, [[[SCP-993]]] has resumed its normal broadcasting. Re-classification to Euclid is being considered.
&gt; 
&gt; ||~ Episode Title ||~ Contents ||
&gt; || &#39;Bobble&#39;s Back!&#39; || Setting of episode appears to be Dr. █████&#39;s office. Bobble appears in the room and Dr. █████ registers shock, then faces the viewer and smiles. Bobble and Dr. █████ then appear to converse for fifteen minutes, although no dialogue is audible. Fifteen minutes in, Dr. █████ raises a pistol and fires upon Bobble to no effect. Bobble then systematically dismembers and removes facial extremities from Dr. █████ using a large butchers knife. Signs of movement are visible from Dr. █████ for three minutes, after which the credits roll. Alarmingly, Dr. █████ disappeared without a trace a day before the episode broadcasted.||
