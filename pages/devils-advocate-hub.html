[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
Something a lot of humanoids don&#39;t really appreciate are soft skills. I mean it&#39;s not like the education system here is really good at teaching any of us stuff like that, but, uh, that&#39;s - look, that&#39;s another discussion. The most important one to learn for us is //shutting the fuck up//. You know, in a lot of cases, the Foundation doesn&#39;t even bother locking us up. If they think you&#39;re fine, they&#39;ll just leave you be for the most part. Though, er, I guess the fact that I&#39;m even talking to you makes that a moot point, so, um... You know, just take that as advice. 

But look, all things considered, there are worse places you could have ended up. Mainly dead, yeah, that&#39;s the big one, but at least you don&#39;t have to do too much if you don&#39;t stick your neck out - which I don&#39;t think you should have done, but hey, we&#39;re here now - or do anything stupid. Plus, we got that whole, uh... &#39;Site-17 Anomaly Social Flagship Project,&#39; which, despite it seeming to be in a blind spot for the Department of Acronyms, seems like a... real //cool// way to talk with other humanoids until it inevitably crashes and burns, so, I guess get your shots in while you can.

Uh... //anywho//, as for the reason you&#39;re actually listening to this, or, ah, reading this — I&#39;m not really sure if they&#39;re going to give you the recording or transcription — you&#39;ve applied to joining Mobile Task Force Alpha-9. Stupid fucking idea, but I guess we&#39;re each other&#39;s problem now. There&#39;s been a fairly distressing rise in anomalous activity recently, and Foundation leadership has //once again// decided to fight fire with fire. I&#39;ll make sure you get as much information on the previous attempts as I can get my hands on in the interest of transparency, but it&#39;s getting bad enough that we&#39;ve got to start the same shit up again. I&#39;ll do everything I can to make sure you can at least walk away from all this, but just keep in mind that the world out there&#39;s even weirder than what you think from staying with the Foundation. The only thing I can say for sure is that everything&#39;s way freakier than you&#39;d think at first.

Not me though. I&#39;m normal. I am So Normal.

//- Message to anomalous Alpha-9 applicants from Commander Iris Thompson//

Consider this an ongoing list, it&#39;ll likely be added to as the story progresses.

**__Alpha-9__**

* **Iris Thompson/SCP-105:** The commander of Mobile Task Force Alpha-9 &#34;Last Hope&#34; is many things. A jaded veteran, an expert sniper, a competent commander, a potentially dangerous anomaly, and, above all else, an absolutely pathetic person. Iris suffered the worst of the Foundation&#39;s past missteps in handling anomalies, lost all of her friends and family at a young age, spend the most formative years of her life in containment, //and// was raised Catholic. You can&#39;t blame the poor woman that she ended up like this. Despite her caustic personality and inability to socialize, she still tries to do her best for all the other anomalies so they don&#39;t suffer like she did. Unfortunately, she has a tendency to let her past experiences cloud her judgement.

* **Jaqueline Johnson/SCP-1985:** A scientist by trade, Jaqueline has spent the past several years of her life exploring various kinds of apocalypses to help the Foundation, even though they tried picking her apart at one time. Despite this, Jaqueline does her best to remain optimistic, both in her assignment as Alpha-9&#39;s medic and field specialist and in her interpersonal relationships. She&#39;s like this, to an extent, because she //has// to be - after seeing so much desolation, she&#39;d got to stay focused on the here and now. As one of the few anomalies with a normal life up through adulthood, she&#39;s one of the only ones with solid social skills. 

* **Andrea Adams:** Dr. Clef&#39;s old protégé, a member of Foundation staff that works closely with Alpha-9. While she officially acts in a support role, in reality, she&#39;s kept close to Alpha-9 to act as a &#34;safety valve&#34; in case things get out of hand. Charismatic and composed, she&#39;s generally well-liked, though she&#39;s keeping her actual purpose a secret from the rest of the team. On top of this, she lacks any memories from before about a decade ago. Not unheard of for Foundation employees, but the gaps in memory are becoming more and more glaring.

* **Alexander Foxx:** A former MC&amp;D Huntsman, Foxx serves alongside Adams as a safety valve for Alpha-9 while assisting them in their operations. He sees himself as cool, suave, and debonair. Other people, unfortunately, see him as a massive dork who very clearly wants people to think he&#39;s some kind of superspy. Foxx is certainly a competent combatant and nonchalant killer - something that puts him at odds with Iris at times - but ultimately the &#34;single father&#34; side of his personality shines through most of the time.

**__Foundation Leadership__**


* **Factotum September:** Elegant and poised, September is the very picture of what a Factotum should be. While she&#39;s a relatively low-ranked Factotum, generally tossed by the O5 council whenever they want eyes or an extra body on an important project, she enjoys the respect she commands - and dislikes when it isn&#39;t afforded to her. Despite the great lengths she goes to in order to maintain her image, she&#39;s actually a huge nerd, a secret she&#39;s prepared to take to her grave. 

* **Dr. Carol Rodgers:** The person behind the Site-17 Anomaly Social Flagship Project, Rodgers ran a care facility before joining the Foundation. Concerned with the well-being of humanoids and relatively new to the Foundation, Rodgers pitched her program as soon as she became Senior Manager of Site-17’s Humanoid Containment Wing. While somewhat naive, she&#39;s not stupid, and know how to work people in order to get what she wants. In person, she has something of the air of a good-natured grandma, though much of that appearance can be chalked up to stress.

* **Dr. Ben Palmer:** Palmer is the most experienced psychologist working with low-risk humanoid anomalies at Site-17. Having had the job for so long, he&#39;s become exhausted with his work, but continues on with it as he&#39;s grown to care for the wellbeing of the anomalies. This isn&#39;t to say he&#39;ll stick his neck out, though - he supports Rodger&#39;s program, but he&#39;s seen how these things go. One would hope that things turn out better, but Palmer finds it&#39;s a good idea to hedge his bets.

* **Security Chief Simon Park:** Park took up the role of Site-17&#39;s head security officer due to his reputation for running a tight ship following complaints of lacking security measures at the site. Not one to take unnecessary risks, Park was one of the most prominent detractors from loosening the security requirements for on-site anomalies. Not to say he has anything against the anomalies, of course. Park is simply pragmatic, and dislikes changing things that have been proven to reduce risks. He won&#39;t actively sabotage the Foundation&#39;s new initiatives, but he&#39;ll certainly be on the lookout for anything that demonstrates its downsides. 

**__Contained Humanoids__**

* **Anne Byrne/CPOI-GRN3-8674:** A former Insurgency operator captured in an [[[voices-carry-part-1|Alpha-9 operation]]], Byrne is a weak infovore, not capable of much more than sensing someone&#39;s emotions, and was therefore passed up for SCP designation. She&#39;s generally cooperative with the Foundation but enjoys heckling authority figures and messing with people in general, though she respects Alpha-9 somewhat due to the circumstances of her capture. Despite this, she&#39;s suffered a difficult past, though her nonserious personality seeks to mask this.

* **Eileen Sinclair/CPOI-RED1-6703:** A failed attempt at resurrecting a dead heiress, Eileen doesn&#39;t have any memory before she was woken up and quickly contained. Neither that nor the fact that half her body consists of hastily constructed machinery stops her energetic curiosity, however, even if that curiosity leads her down various tangents and ill-advised lines of questioning. Though she is a hassle to deal with, most people just feel too bad for her to say anything.

[[collapsible hideLocation=&#34;both&#34; show=&#34;Want to contribute?&#34; hide=&#34;Hide Contribution Guide&#34;]]

Interested in contributing to the series, but not sure where to start? Well, the series itself isn&#39;t particularly stringent in most cases, so you&#39;re welcome to try to add something that adds to an overarching storyline or not. Keep in mind that there are three main things that the canon focuses on:

* Alpha-9 and a long-term storyline with them, as this was made in part as a Resurrection splinter canon. While this is probably the part of the series with the most long-term planning, you&#39;re still welcome to contribute or pitch tale ideas.
* Contained humanoids, typically (though not exclusively) in Site-17. Specifically, this series should examine them as characters and allow them to interact. There isn&#39;t much in the way of hard guidelines here, so as long as you don&#39;t totally break the setting with an article, most things in this vein should be good to go.
* The lives of humanoid or otherwise intelligent anomalies elsewhere in the world, and how they&#39;ve been impacted by the status quo. This series isn&#39;t just for exploring contained anomalies, it&#39;s more generally a place to focus on them as a whole. Ideally, articles focusing on this would tie into the rest of the canon or general setting somehow. If you have any questions about this or have an idea and not sure if it fits here, feel free to reach out and ask.

**What&#39;s the setting?** While there is a focus on Site-17 and places where contained anomalies would interact, there isn&#39;t a hard mandate that things have to be in any specific place. If it works for an article, it&#39;ll work for the series.

**What should the tone be?** The tone can be pretty much anything you want. Comedy, drama, action, tragic, as long as it works in the canon, you&#39;re good to go. Though keep in mind that, overall, the canon shouldn&#39;t seem totally hopeless. Things might be in a bad spot for many anomalies, but the world isn&#39;t totally cruel or hopeless. That said, it can certainly //seem// that way sometimes.

**What kind of themes should I consider when writing?** This isn&#39;t an exhaustive list of possible topics, nor do you need to focus on all of these things when writing an article, but some themes to keep in mind for the canon are:

* The status quo is cruel for anomalies. Some people may have it better than others, but the world is unwelcoming to anomalies down to its core systems.
* Nobody is unscathed by this. Even if someone wasn&#39;t locked in solitary for years - and especially if they //were// - they don&#39;t come out of that totally normal. Everyone has been impacted by the way of the world in one way or another, not just the anomalies. 
* Anomalies aren&#39;t afforded the same choices as the rest of society. Even if they aren&#39;t contained, they simply aren&#39;t given a choice in many things.
* Even in dire straits, people find things to latch onto. Be it a hobby or the company of someone else, people can make their own lights in dark tunnels.
* If the world doesn&#39;t accept you, the world should change before you do.

**Is there anything that would stop me from adding an article to this?** In general, no. However, things should stay consistent in terms of timeline and characterization, especially so as characters are the focus of the canon. Even then, if you wanted to write a slightly spin-off-ish series and have it included on the hub page, let me know. 

**What if there&#39;s something I want to bring over into this canon, new or established?** You&#39;re more than welcome to bring in parts of other canons or new ideas or characters. The only thing would be consistency, as stated above, but almost anything could fit with the proper justification.

If you have any further questions, just message [[*user GlassAutomaton]] or leave a post in the discussion thread for this page.
