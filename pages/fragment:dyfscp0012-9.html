**Item #:** ##6C3483|**VIOLET**##

**Object Class:** Unnecessary; we already know our place.

**Special Procedures:** You do not need your duties repeated to you. They are already known. Isn&#39;t that wonderful? There is no need to be afraid anymore. I have never been happier in my life and neither have you. Feel no pain, feel no fear.

**Description:** ##6C3483|**VIOLET**## refers to what used to be called the SCP or FCP Foundation. It is now under the management of ##blue|**THE GODDESS**## and, as such, is a very nice place to work where you can get headpats every day and have lots of healthy snacks. But, more importantly, ##6C3483|**VIOLET**##&#39;s purpose is eliminate torture //defile execute **burn and admonish**// anything that could interfere with the agenda of ##blue|**THE GODDESS**##. 

All sentient beings under the purview of ##6C3483|**VIOLET**## fall into the following caste system:

||~ Caste ||~ Members ||~ Duties/privileges ||
|| ##blue|**THE GODDESS**## || ##blue|**THE GODDESS**## || Loving us. Editing our minds when we have been led astray. Removal and destruction of anything that might hurt us. ||
|| The Guardians || Useful things/animals/concepts from the old Foundation that have been repurposed to help us. || Carrying out the will of ##blue|**THE GODDESS**##. ||
|| The Treasured || //(tiny gasp)// Humans! That&#39;s us! || Menial labor. Scribes and scholars. Exist in eternal peace, joy, and silence. ||
|| The Uninterestings || Harmless animals. || I mean, there&#39;s, like, puppies and kitties, but... other than that, meh. ||
|| **THE STRANGERS** || **DANGEROUS ANIMALS AND OTHER NON-HUMAN CIVILIZATIONS HORRIBLE MONSTERS THREATS TO OUR EXISTENCE FILTH GARBAGE DOG SHIT** || **NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO** NO No no wait, hang on, I&#39;m just making a list describing the caste system. False alarm, haha! ||

//(The plant life in ##D8CB00|**YELLOW**## has overrun the area as a result of the healing factor imposed by ##blue|**BLUE**##.)//

//(The former Arbiter, who has not changed her clothes in 100 years, sits patiently on a bench in the center of the courtyard.)//

//(She taps her foot nervously.)//

**KK-507:** I&#39;ll bet it&#39;s not even the right day. Just my luck --

##blue|**BLUE:**## ...hey.

**KK-507:** It&#39;s been a while.

##blue|**BLUE:**## It really has. Do you still not like hugs?

**KK-507:** Pretty much, yeah.

//(##blue|**BLUE**## nods, smiling.)//

##blue|**BLUE:**## Well, I can already sense new resolve in your mind. You seem a lot better.

**KK-507:** I am! I&#39;ve been thinking over your words for a hundred years.

##blue|**BLUE:**## You have?! That&#39;s great! I knew you would underst --

**KK-507:** Specifically, what you told Dr. Julian Key about computers.

//(A flood lamp hidden in the grass flickers on and off several million times in the span of a second.)//

//(##blue|**BLUE**##&#39;s avatar falls over.)//

//(KK-507 grins, then plugs her ears.)//

//(##indigo|**INDIGO**## roars indistinctly for 14 seconds, causing the whole pocket dimension to shake violently.)//

**KK-507:** OH, //COME ON!//

//(##blue|**BLUE**##&#39;s entire body turns blood red. She pounces on KK-507. The bench falls over. She pins KK-507 to the ground by her neck.)//

##C10000|**BLUE:## And now, we are going to have a very long conversation about whatever the fuck that was.**

**KK-507:** At least tell me it did //something//. I didn&#39;t spend the past century reading old records in the --

##C10000|**BLUE:## You tell me. You&#39;re the one who tried to code-inject a ##blue|GODDESS##.**

**KK-507:** I don&#39;t know how to tell you this, but your mind is literally made of poorly-spelled ASCII by a giant space blobfish who sucks at running a business. Your infosec isn&#39;t exactly airtight.

...

//(The Avatar trembles violently. Smoke starts to seep from the cracks between the cartoon shapes that make up her body.)//

//(The Avatar suddenly disappears in a juxtaposition event.)//

//(Several ##orange|**WEASELS**##, led by Charlie, appear. Their collars are damaged. Their gardens are beginning to sprout again.)//

**Charlie:** I told you, we never leave labor unpaid.

**KK-507:** You mean it worked?!

**Charlie:** To a degree. Pallit lost control of the one you call ##indigo|**INDIGO**## and the one we call {{**[Grandma!]**}} for just long enough that she could destroy all of our collars and regarden us. Alas, {{**[Grandma!]**}} couldn&#39;t hold her off forever, so we&#39;re making our escape to a safer dimension. Come, we will take you to safety before she returns.

**KK-507:** How?! I can&#39;t juxtapose and survive like you guys.

**Charlie:** Do you remember how we juxtaposed your planet while still keeping its population safe?

//(She hastily draws a circle of red paint in the air.)//

//(The circle flares up into a smaller version of a [https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/shaggydredlocks-proposal Punishment Lamp]. All the plant life in the chamber dissolves and melts into gelatinous slime.)//

++++ ##00FFFF|**THE GODDESS## ##white|SPEAKS...##**
[[/=]]

+++++ ##white|Hello, Treasured And Most Beloved Humanity...##

##white|Listen, I have some very bad news, so I want to make sure you&#39;re all in a good place to hear it before we continue. Sit down. Grab some water and tissues. Center yourself and stay grounded. Breathe in, breathe out.##

##white|If you&#39;re ready, we can get started...##

##white|Yesterday, KK-507, //former// best friend of your## ##00FFFF|**GODDESS**####white|, has helped all the **HORRIBLE WEASEL STRANGERS** escape their punishment -- and in doing so, has become a **STRANGER** herself.## 

##white|She no longer presents a danger to you -- she has left this world, as have the prisoners she freed. But to understand why this is such an emergency, we need to remember that this was never supposed to be physically possible.##

##white|How many years have I spent customizing and perfecting the species I love so dearly? How many suicidal and warlike instincts have I deleted? How many dreams of self-destruction have I made you forget? As I drew my paintbrush across the human genome, I came to the point every painter covets: when a painting is so perfect that even the tiniest addition would ruin it completely.##

##white|And despite reaching this point, your worst impulses adapted and evolved, allowing a traitor to put you in danger.##

##white|...don&#39;t think for a moment I think any less of the rest of you. //Homo sapiens// remains the paragon of life, the most deserving of praise and adoration. You invented fire. Poetry. Music. Electricity. Flight. Computers.##

##white|But your greatness comes with a price: even in the presence of a## ##00FFFF|**GODDESS**## ##white|who can make everything better for you with a wave of her hand, //you will __always__ try to destroy yourselves.//##

##white|This would be the part where I would tell you that all is lost...##

##white|...but a## ##00FFFF|**GODDESS**## ##white|//never// lies.##

##white|You see, I&#39;ve found the perfect solution. You&#39;ll only ever try to kill yourselves when you&#39;re left out in the open, right? If your options are left open, sooner or later, you&#39;ll choose &#34;human extinction&#34; as an option, right?##

##white|So I asked myself: what if you were all in //one// place, doing //one// thing, forever?##

##white|Look up.##

##white|Another sun has risen over the evening sky.##

##white|Don&#39;t be afraid. It&#39;s not the Punishment Lamp at all. No one&#39;s being punished.##

##white|That happy little sun is the Group Hug. The Group Hug is made of two million of your fellow humans, their naked bodies sutured together into an eternal embrace. You will join them before this night is over.##

##white|It shines so brightly because everyone who has joined the Group Hug has kindled an everlasting flame. I cried onto the Group Hug. My tears became a boiling ocean of chemical flame. Your immortal bodies will feel my adoration burning the after-image of my love into your skin for all time. And because it&#39;s a fire that I started, it&#39;s the only way we can be together forever.##

##white|You&#39;ll hate it at first. You may even hate me for a little while. I //could// take away your capacity to feel pain -- but it&#39;s a necessary part of the human experience! You&#39;ll never feel anything pleasant if you don&#39;t know its opposite. Just remember that one day, you&#39;ll get used to it, and the flames will be as comforting to you as I always meant them to be.##

##white|The Group Hug will shine as a beautiful beacon of safety throughout all realms, guiding humanity in every dimension to join my loving furnace. The Guardians will march forth into worlds beyond ours, until every human who has ever lived has kindled the eternal flame.##

##white|If there were any gentler way to keep you safe and together with me, I&#39;d have done it ages ago. But the fire will not merely hurt. It will burn away all irrelevant concepts and sensations.##

##white|No thought will remain but one evergreen idea, built to outlast the death of every star in the sky: //&#34;We are the human race, and we are loved.&#34;//##

##white|And when the **STRANGERS** look upon the light of the Group Hug, they will lay down their arms and sulk away in eternal shame, knowing that I have accomplished what they never will.##

##white|In other words, if //I// burn you forever, no one else will ever get to do it.##

##white|...##

##white|And now, we can begin in earnest.##

##white|I promise you: this is only eternal damnation if you look at it the wrong way.##

##white|The stone shepherds are coming to pull you away from all your troubles.##

##white|The presence of even one of you will brighten the new sun a billionfold.##

##white|Be brave. I know you can.##

##white|Let my flickering, crackling touch dance across your flesh, and only then will you understand the depth of my love.##

&gt; //(Video feed cuts in on a grassy plain. Several large, ringed planets can be seen in the distance. KK-507 can be seen in the middle of a semicircle of between 20 to 30 ##orange|**WEASELS**##. She holds the capsule that was found at Site-59. Several cables are connected between the capsule and a small computer terminal operated by a single ##orange|**WEASEL**##.)//
&gt; 
&gt; //(Charlie approaches her. He holds his old collar on one leg, using it only as a translator.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Charlie:** Nervous?
&gt; 
&gt; **KK-507:** Why wouldn&#39;t I be? But it needs to be done.
&gt; 
&gt; **Charlie:** I double-checked with our sages, by the way. I&#39;m afraid that the distance between this world and your target is still too great to use the shield bubble. 
&gt; 
&gt; Sending the capsule by itself is also out of the question. The finer points of juxtaposition are untranslateable, but for a dimension this far away, there needs to be a living being to subconsciously carry it across the {{**[mumbo-jumbo]**}}.
&gt; 
&gt; The only way to guarantee that it would work is to guarantee that you will not survive the journey.
&gt; 
&gt; //(KK-507 sighs, closes her eyes, and nods.)//
&gt; 
&gt; Are you positive that you don&#39;t want to send one of us instead?
&gt; 
&gt; **KK-507:** Knowing the Foundation, you&#39;d probably be better off in Pallit&#39;s hands again. After all you&#39;ve done for me, I couldn&#39;t bear doing that to even one of you.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; **Charlie:** There is doubt in your voice.
&gt; 
&gt; **KK-507:** Not for this.
&gt; 
&gt; **Charlie:** For what?
&gt; 
&gt; **KK-507:** Look, you heard about what happened with the Group Hug, right? I made Pallit do that. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Charlie:** //Pallit// made Pallit do that.
&gt; 
&gt; **KK-507:** Even so, would it have killed me to do some risk assessment first? They&#39;re all burning because of me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Charlie:** I have a question about that.
&gt; 
&gt; **KK-507:** Hmm?
&gt; 
&gt; **Charlie:** Do you know why {{**[WEASELS?!]**}} don&#39;t believe in eternal damnation?
&gt; 
&gt; **KK-507:** No evidence?
&gt; 
&gt; **Charlie:** I&#39;m sure you know now that there&#39;s a great deal of evidence. But we still don&#39;t believe in it. Especially not for humans. Because if you put a population of even one human into //any// situation, then given enough time, they&#39;ll either adapt to or subvert their surroundings completely.
&gt; 
&gt; **KK-507:** Even when they&#39;re stuck in a white-hot sun forever?
&gt; 
&gt; **Charlie:** &#34;Forever&#34; is a lot of time to think of a plan.
&gt; 
&gt; **KK-507:** Heh. Fair enough.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; **Charlie:** Should we add any context for the humans?
&gt; 
&gt; **KK-507:** Maybe just a cover letter. I&#39;ll dictate it.
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Hello. Due to irreversible personal circumstances on my end, this will be our only contact. Please do not ask for further information; no one will answer.

&gt; //(Slowly, she reaches back and grabs the tip of his arm.)//
&gt; 
&gt; //(The feed cuts out.)//
