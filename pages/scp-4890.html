**Item #:** SCP-4890

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4890 is to be kept within Storage Locker-23 at Site-13. Testing is to be performed in Testing Chamber 17 under the approval of Level 3 personnel.

**Description:** SCP-4890 is a hardcover children&#39;s pop-up book titled &#34;Dr. Wondertainment&#39;s Guide to History&#34; with a stylized W at the center of the cover. On the back of the cover of the book, there is a small pocket holding SCP-4890-1. SCP-4890-1 is a 0.147 meters tall origami depicting an individual with a purple suit, bow tie, and hat along with a cane. On the torso piece, is a small stylized W.

SCP-4890&#39;s anomalous properties occur when the object is opened by a sapient being indoors. The room that SCP-4890 is opened in will morph to a seemingly infinite purple space. An invisible barrier matching the measurements of the room originally will prevent any exploration, and a door will be present to allow exit or entry into the altered environment. As this occurs, SCP-4890-1 will activate by being shrouded in a large puff of smoke instantaneously to become 1.4 meters tall and animate.

SCP-4890-1 is sapient and capable of vocalization in English. It speaks in a mostly enthusiastic tone and identifies itself as &#34;Dr. Papertainment&#34; to personnel. SCP-4890-1 possesses control of the infinite space by altering the surrounding space to appear as historic periods or events and acts as a guide in regards to what is presented. Although, sometimes details mentioned by SCP-4890-1 can be inaccurate, ridiculous, or lack any evidence of ever occurring. Individuals present may make requests to SCP-4890-1 to view a specific time period or it will automatically select one. See Addendum 01 and Addendum 02.

As the environment alters, the pages of SCP-4890 will flip to reveal a page displaying an image corresponding to the forming surroundings. It also unknown how many pages SCP-4890 contains and efforts at determining it has been inconclusive.

SCP-4890 was found on 7/14/2009 at a library located in Lincoln, Nebraska by Foundation agents during an unrelated investigation.

**Addendum 01:** The following transcript was of Dr. Galesburg interacting with SCP-4890-1 within Testing Chamber 12 during earlier testing.
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Open Transcript&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4890-1:** Hello there, welcome to Dr. Wondertainment&#39;s Guide to History. I&#39;m Dr. Papertainment and will be your guide throughout history! Golly!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Galesburg:** Uh, hello. I&#39;m Dr. Galesburg.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4890-1:** Ah, a doctor! A pleasure to meet you! [Tips hat] When would you like to go?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Galesburg:** When?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4890-1:** Yeah, would you like to see the knights of yore or the pharaohs of Egypt!? Whatever you want!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Galesburg:** Hmm. Alright, what about...the Cretaceous period?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4890-1:** Can do! [Twirls cane]
&gt; 
&gt; //[Surroundings alter to resemble a jungle and in the distance a volcano is visible.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4890-1:** Ah, the Dinosaurs! Such a time. There is not much to say about this time, except a lot of chomp-chomp-chomp. Like a good old T-Rex!
&gt; 
&gt; //[A roar is heard in the distance.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Galesburg:** Yeah, are we safe?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4890-1:** Of course! Anyway, like I was saying, there&#39;s not much to say about this era, except for how it affected the future! Without this period, we wouldn&#39;t have Dr. Wondertainment&#39;s Dynamic Dino Dude or Mr. Cretaceous from the Little Misters... but sadly his production has gone extinct! [Laughs] By the way, don&#39;t forget to buy yours today! Where were we? Oh, the Dinosaurs are fun to watch. Lets see one!
&gt; 
&gt; //[A specimen of Triceratops prorsus is seen exiting from behind bushes and moves out of view behind more bushes.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4890-1:** Uh, okay, that was not as cool as I was hoping, but there is quite a lot stuff to see around here. Do you like cowboys?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Galesburg:** Um...no. I don&#39;t. Why?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4890-1:** Thought you might like to see something cool. Have you ever seen a T-Rex&#39;s head get blown off with TNT? Cool, but poor Rexy... Anyway, soon a [http://www.scp-wiki.net/a-fancy-dinosaur fancy Dino] around here is going to receive a special order. I think I can slightly see it from here. [Points up]
&gt; 
&gt; //[A small bright light is visible in the sky]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4890-1:** Oh boy, marvelous.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Galesburg:** Is that a meteor?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4890-1:** Oh yes, a marvelous one. They cost only five dollars these days. Now, if you look to your left you will see a //Velocihonktor clownus//. They told the best jokes to capture prey and escape predators.
&gt; 
&gt; //[A Velociraptor wearing a clown suit is visible emerging from bushes holding a bicycle horn.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Galesburg:** Well, thank you. I think I&#39;m done here. [Proceeds to the door as environment begins to fade.]
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4890-1:** Well, come back again! There is still some other stuff to see here and at other times!Â 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Dr. Galesburg exists out of Testing Chamber 12]//

Afterwards, small lights where visible that SCP-4890-1 stated to be the first stars and thereafter distant galaxies became visible.

**Addendum 03:** Level 4 clearance required
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Insert Credentials&#34; hide=&#34;- ACCESS GRANTED&#34;]]

The following is a portion of a transcript with SCP-4890-1 when it was asked to tell the first war in history. The surroundings that formed were silhouettes.

&gt; Long ago, men huddled in caves, afraid of the strange world. When man started, they roamed along side their siblings, whom were [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1788 odd] or [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1000 hairy], and witnessed great beasts and entities they called gods that refused to share the Earth and sky as home. Oh my!
&gt; 
&gt; One day, there came a great war, the first war. Men, along with their siblings, marched on armed with gifts and the aid of sympathetic gods to face an army of great nightmares. Eventually, man and their allies won the war and those that remained of the nightmares fled into the shadows of the world. They celebrated but they still lost many of their siblings. Tragic.
&gt; 
&gt; That&#39;s all! I could go into detail but it&#39;s so much and not enough time. Besides, it makes it easier for me. Also, you are all technically still fighting the good fight! Anyway, anything else you want to know?

Despite requests, SCP-4890-1 has refused to discuss the subject further.
