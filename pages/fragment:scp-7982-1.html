**Item #:** SCP-7982

**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7982 is to be kept in a heavily guarded low-humidity storage unit located at Site-██. Information pertaining to the specific location of SCP-7982 is to be restricted to Level 4 Researchers and above, as well as individuals with special clearance granted by the Lead Researcher of SCP-7982 (currently, Dr. Guillaume-Schmidt). 

**Containment Update 06/08/1987:** Given recent events, all staff members assigned to SCP-7982 are now subject to Class 12-T background screenings and regular mnestic-assisted psychological evaluations. Staff members who defected from any Group of Interests are no longer granted access to Site-██, and are to be relocated to other Foundation sites if possible.

**Description:** SCP-7982 is an iron meteorite found in 1923 in Denmark, with a weight of 9 tonnes and a roughly ovaloid shape. SCP-7982 is mostly hollow, with the iron oxide only making up a shell-like structure approximately ten centimeters thick. The vast majority of the space inside of SCP-7982 is occupied by a sphere of solid iron with a diameter of fifty-seven centimeters, which is marked by a highly complex Widmanstätten pattern covering roughly 97% of its surface. 

Unlike all other known meteorites, the Widmanstätten pattern contained in SCP-7982 appears to be highly organized, with different sectors and pathways being clearly visible. These sectors vary in size, with the largest one covering 35 cm^^2^^ and the smallest known one only covering 110 nm^^2^^.[[footnote]] The lower bound of the potential size of these patterns is unknown. [[/footnote]]  
At two diametrically opposed points of the sphere, two cylinders protrude from the surface and extend past the iron oxide shell of SCP-7982. Exposing one of these cylinders to an electric current results in the other one generating a low-strength electric current with a rapidly fluctuating voltage, enabling it to function as a data-transmitting cable. 

Connecting this cylinder to a computational system shows that SCP-7982 is able to act as a computer-like object itself, with both performance and storage capabilities far above what currently available computers are capable of. Although the specific structure of SCP-7982 differs significantly from non-anomalous computers, it is possible to run external programs on the object with some minor alterations. 

Precisely measuring the performance of SCP-7982 has proven difficult. Commercially available benchmark tests fail to be effective due to the unusual architecture of SCP-7982, and Foundation-developed tools give a wide range of estimates depending both on the time of measurement and the method used to garner these measurements. It is currently assumed that the performance of SCP-7982 is not static and dependent on factors still not well understood, although a significant minority of researchers propose that these fluctuations are solely the result of insufficient methods of measurement and can not be considered indicative of the performance of the object itself.

So far, estimates of the performance of SCP-7982 have ranged from 15 to 20 TFLOPS[[footnote]] 15.000 to 20.000 GFLOPS. [[/footnote]]. For comparison, the world’s fastest supercomputer[[footnote]] Cray 2, designed and built by Cray Research. [[/footnote]] has a theoretical peak system performance of 1.9 GFLOPS.

Although SCP-7982 has been in Foundation custody since 1923, it took until 1984 to recognize the potential applications of the object. In the fours years it has been actively used by the Foundation, SCP-7982 was instrumental in both aiding current containment procedures and enabling new developments of several entirely new pieces of technology that would have otherwise been completely unattainable using current technology. Examples include:

* Predicting extreme weather events far earlier than modern meteorology is able to, aiding in the containment of [[[SCP-4159]]] and [[[SCP-1529]]].
* 
* Estimating the drag coefficient of several Foundation aircraft models before they entered production, saving a significant amount of funds that would have otherwise been spent on testing.
* 
* Cryptographically breaking the SHA-1 algorithm, enabling Foundation intelligence operatives to directly wiretap leading members of the Chaos Insurgency.

Further research into the mechanism of action of SCP-7982 is ongoing under the codename &#34;Project PROMETHEUS&#34;. Current goals are to find a method to intensify the anomalous effect of SCP-7982 in an effort to increase the computational performance of it, and to create copies of SCP-7982 that possess the same properties as the main object.
 

**Addendum 7982.1:** Following a data breach concerning all Foundation sites in ███████, several Groups of Interests gained access to documentation pertaining SCP-7982 and associated testing logs. To date, three attempts to remove SCP-7982 from Foundation custody have been recorded, with two resulting in multiple fatalities and severe damage to Site-██ itself. As the relocation of the object was deemed unfeasible [[footnote]] Due to the lack of means to safeguard any potential transport. [[/footnote]], efforts have been made to strengthen security at Site-██ and reduce the potential impact of any foreign agents embedded in the Foundation itself (see Containment Update 06/08/1987).
