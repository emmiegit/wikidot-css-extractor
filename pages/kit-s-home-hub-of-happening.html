&gt; If you like my work - if it made you chuckle, made you think, made you sad, made you happy, consider being a [https://www.patreon.com/ZacharyMaxwell Pateron.] 
&gt; 
&gt; My work will **never** be behind a paywall, and will only be enhanced by any Paterons who care to support my efforts here, based on tier rewards from a very reasonable price. It is much appreciated if you even read my work, let alone want to support a (sometimes literally) starving artist. This is not a requirement, and becoming a Pateron is not guaranteed to speed up my work, which I would never promise anyway! I will always write for the fun of it first, but any help you can offer if my Tales have entertained you is much appreciated.

//All these terms have some flexibility within the alleyway world - for example, you may call a partner in a casual sexual encounter &#39;boss&#39;, but you wouldn&#39;t just call someone who is your superior &#39;boss&#39;, though they may call you &#39;boy-ya&#39; with no sexual intentions. It&#39;s about context over meaning.//
