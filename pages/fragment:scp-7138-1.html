**Item #:** SCP-7138

**Object Class:** Pending

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7138 will be stored in a ##blue|standard non-humanoid## containment room. ##blue|Personnel interacting with SCP-7138 are advised to follow anti-cognitohazard protocols.## All interactions with SCP-7138 must be approved and supervised by Dr. Montgomery.

**Description:** SCP-7138 is a 1 square meter canvas covered in magenta paint of various shades. ##blue|Subjects exposed to SCP-7138 report heightened anxiety and aversion to the color magenta. On at least one occasion, exposure to SCP-7138 has caused subjects to self-mutilate and remove their own eyes. 
SCP-7138 does not emit any thaumic radiation, nor are its effects hampered by Scranton reality anchors.##

**Discovery:** SCP-7138 came to the Foundation’s attention during an investigation into the deaths of several suspected members of AWCY (designated subjects 7138-A through C) during a &#34;twenty-four-hour art contest&#34;. ##blue|Interviews with 7138-C indicate that they may not have intended to create SCP-7138.##

**Log 7138-1**
-----
**Dr. Montgomery:** Okie Dokie. This is log entry number one for research into SCP-7138. Results so far have been... inconclusive, to say the least.

[Papers shuffle]

SCP-7138 isn&#39;t like any other AWCY anomaly I&#39;ve encountered, and as far as we can tell, it&#39;s not memetic. So there goes my best guess out the window. None of the D-class that have been exposed to SCP-7138 have done anything like gouging out their eyes. They just sit around, reporting feelings of &#34;anxiety&#34; and &#34;nervousness&#34;. Hardly anything to work with.

It seems reasonable to assume there&#39;s some kind of criteria that has to be met before SCP-7138 displays its full abilities, but what that criteria is, I have no idea. I have some tests in mind, though. Hopefully one of them will give me some clues.

**Log 7138-2**
-----
**Dr. Montgomery:** Alright, this is the second log for SCP-7138 research. Yesterday, a D-class exposed to SCP-7138 went crazy and plucked out their eyes, making them Subject 7138-D. So yay! Case Closed!

[Sighs] 

I wish. We still have no idea what SCP-7138 actually did, or how it did it. That guy was locked in a room with SCP-7138 for two whole days. Heck, if I had to stare at that painting for two days, I&#39;d probably want to go blind. 

All this proves is that there is something to SCP-7138. Something makes it act the way it does. Something will make all of this make sense. But I have no idea what that something could be.

Honestly, I&#39;m running out of ideas for tests to run on this thing. I feel like I&#39;m just throwing stuff at it to see what sticks.

**Log 7138-3**
-----
[Approximately five minutes of shuffling expunged.]
**Dr. Montgomery:** Well, this is the... third? fourth? SCP-7138 research log, and I&#39;m still staring at a stupid painting trying to figure out what the heck makes it tick.

[Significant silence]

Carl called the other day. Said he wanted an update on my progress. It was more than that, though. He&#39;d seen my experiment proposals. He was checking in to make sure I&#39;m still sane.

[Laughter]

I don&#39;t blame him. What does he expect? I&#39;m at the end of my rope, trying to figure out an SCP that just doesn&#39;t make sense! It&#39;s impossible! Anyone who actually experiences it goes insane, and everyone else just sees some weird magenta shapes on a piece of canvas! Where&#39;s the sense in that? How does it do it? Who knows?

[A shaky breath can be heard]

No. It has to make sense. I know it does. Everything makes sense, if you strip away the fluff. It&#39;s no different here. There is a truth in SCP-7138, under that stupid magenta paint. A truth that will make this whole thing click. And I&#39;m going to find that truth.
