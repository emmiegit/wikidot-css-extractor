+++ What is a tag, and what are they used for?
A tag is a keyword we apply to a page on this wiki. This keyword allows you to find all pages with similar elements. You can use the [http://www.scp-wiki.net//tag-search tag search page] to combine multiple tags and find articles tagged (for example) //euclid// and //humanoid//, or //automaton//, //keter//, and //broken-god//, or you can click on a tag you see on a page to get a list of all pages tagged with that specific tag. Which brings us to...

+++ Where are these tags?
Go to the bottom of any page on the wiki. You&#39;ll see small divider bar and below that a list of words in a smaller red typeface. Those are tags. You can click on them to get to a list of things tagged with that tag. If you&#39;re not seeing any, we haven&#39;t gotten round to applying them.

+++ What tags are there?
[http://05command.wikidot.com/tech-hub-tag-list Extensive lists are available], along with when to apply them and when not to. Sometimes tags overlap, or supercede other tags, so it&#39;s something that needs a bit of thought put into it. Speaking of which...

+++ How do I tag a page?
You don&#39;t have to. Our technical team and selected users will tag any article that&#39;s created. If you&#39;d like to try your hand at tagging an article that doesn&#39;t have any yet, read the [http://05command.wikidot.com/tech-hub-tag tag guide] thoroughly and [[[contact-staff|contact the Technical Team]]] with your suggestions. If they give you the go-ahead, feel free to apply them to the article.

+++ I have an idea for a tag!
Once enough articles cover a certain subject, a tag might be needed to index these pages. If you have an idea for a tag, [[[contact-staff|contact the Technical Team]]] or [/forum/t-13260150/tag-thread-3:revenge-of-the-tags post on the Tag Suggestion Thread] (see [/forum/t-13260155/character-tags-2:judgement-day here] for character tags) with a list of the pages you feel should get this new tag, and the reasoning behind the tag. For character, organizational, or other in-universe tags the standard is five pages by three authors. For attribute tag suggestions, at least ten articles are needed. You don&#39;t have to be a staff member to do this, anyone is free to contribute.</textarea></pre>
