**Foreword:** out of all my fandoms, SCP used to be the only one for which I haven&#39;t drawn anything yet. Enter Gold Proposal. This wonderful story has inspired me so much, I had to channel my pent-up inspiration into drawings. 
Make sure to read [[[rounderhouse-gold-proposal|]]] and [[[heresy|]]] if you haven&#39;t already and check out the rest of the [[[redtape | REDTAPE]]] series, too. Trust me when I say it&#39;s worth every word.

Another fanart for [[[heresy|]]]. This time it&#39;s a cover-style illustration, inspired by the quote on the picture, as well as the one above it.

Robert was waging some real heavy-duty psychological warfare against Hedvig. Like, exerting a downright crazy amount of pressure on her. And yet, his attempts were still futile. Hedvig had an insane amount of resolve in herself, enough to persist even under the influence of the Voice (even if severely weakened). Despite the sheer amount of manipulation, brainwashing, and what have you done to her by Robert, her spirit STILL wasn&#39;t fully broken. Away from him and his influence, with support and encouragement offered by Hedara&#39;s spirit, she was able to successfully recover the old parts of herself that were forcefully hidden away. 

The specimen imagery is intended to invoke, among the above mentioned quotes, this part: //&#34;Like a caged tiger, restrained for the knowledge that he could restrain her.&#34;// 

This image also showcases my headcanon outfit for Hedvig. This would be a part of her ceremonial attire, worn when attending formal duties with Robert. When out crusading, I can imagine she had proper armor on.

[[[heresy|]]] is such a wonderful tale. It is literally everything I could have ever wanted from a Rounder Hedvig tale. It&#39;s beautifully written, it has a strong emotional core, it expands upon the backstory of the sweet Hedara, it fully explores the heavy, complicated relationship between Robert and Hedvig that prior works implied (namely Gold, Interregnum, and the Redtape Hub), it fulfilled my expectations of giving me fun new mental illnesses the likes of which weren&#39;t seen since Gold... You get the idea. You thought it wouldn&#39;t inspire me to draw something from it? Think again! 

This is the first illustration out of the many I have planned, featuring Robert preparing to do surgery on Hedvig as described in the quote above. With this drawing, both of their designs have been finalized. I&#39;m quite satisfied with how I drew Hedvig! Too bad we can only see like 80% of her.

[[tab Hedvig and Robert]]
[[=image Hedvig_and_Robert.png]]
[[div class=&#34;fancyborder&#34;]]
This was my first Gold Proposal fanart! Picture this a few years after Gold Proposal&#39;s events, with both of them now having heavier augmentations and everything. I haven&#39;t worked much with yellow before this, but I&#39;ve got to admit, it&#39;s rather fun! 
@@ @@
Notes: 
* the augmentations were drawn to be armor-like
* Aram (Bumaro) had glowing yellow eyes in the prior version, I have opted for a visor because I think it&#39;s sicker
* I gave him a cape as well because come on. He&#39;d definitely look good in a cape
* the loincloths are there for decoration
* the hammer looked different in the prior version as well. This one was referenced off the hammer in [https://www.tumblr.com/asteroidtroglodyte/722379873300152320/move-aside-swagless-boutta-get-a-new-wizards this post]. I&#39;ve opted to change it because I thought a hammer like this would make more sense than... whatever the previous one was
PS: CotBG has showed me the appeal of war hammers. I&#39;m not well-versed in weapons so I can&#39;t comment on their actual functionality, but they DEFINITELY excel in the looks department.

[[tab Screws loose Hedvig]]

[[div class=&#34;fancyborder&#34;]]
MFW Robert is trying to stuff you into the mech suit again. The [https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/045/765/screw_loose_emoji.jpg loose screws emoji] has been gaining popularity on twitter, including as redraws, so I&#39;ve tried my own hands at redrawing it. 
This is how I picture Nussbaum shortly before she started drafting her unsent email. 
Fun fact: I wanted to draw a pre-augmented whimsical version as well where she was twirling her finger with a silly smile. Maybe someday. 
The wings look different than on the previous picture because I was experimenting. I&#39;m not sure whether the triangles or the &#34;feathers&#34; fit the aesthetic more. I&#39;ll see how it will turn out on my potential future drawings.

[[tab REMIXCON ENTRY - Hedvig as a Karcist]]
[[=image Karcist_Hedvig.png]]
[[div class=&#34;fancyborder&#34;]]
I was told that you can do anything for Remixcon, so I&#39;ve decided to go for the most obvious option: redraw a Mekhanite saint as a NÃ¤lkÃ¤n Karcist. And who&#39;s more suitable for this job than sweet Hedvig?

[[tab GOItober Day 21 - Robert Bumaro]]
[[=image this_is_a_bumaro.png]]
[[div class=&#34;fancyborder&#34;]]
Drew a mural-style drawing of none other than Aram himself! He&#39;s a Bumaro after all, isn&#39;t he? In fact, he&#39;s overtaken Twinkmaro as my favorite Bumaro interpretation. 
Find the drawing on its GOItober entry page riiiiight here, together with a whopping one more art: [[[art:sweetlapiskeyboard-goitober2023|SweetLapisKeyboard&#39;s GOItober Arts]]]. Unfortunately my creative input has waned significantly, so he only has one drawing over there to keep him company.

It&#39;s a time-honored tradition that when I see a [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F_a6invbgAAl8ll?format=jpg&amp;name=large cute dress], I am overcome with the desire to put my favorite characters in it. Currently that character just so happens to be Hedvig! 
Pretend they held a party for her successful recovery following the wall collapse incident and she showed up to the party looking her best, of course. I think Hedvig should wear many beautiful, beautiful dresses

[[tab Hedvig and Robert (doodle)]]
[[=image Hedvig_and_Robert_reading.png]]
[[div class=&#34;fancyborder&#34;]]
Something silly for the holiday seasons. The other day I asked Rounder like, &#34;Rounder, how tall are Robert and Hedvig&#34; and he was like &#34;uhh they&#39;re around 5&#39;4 and 5&#39;11 respectively&#34;. So here. A small doodle of tall Hedvig reading a paper over short Robert&#39;s --shoulders-- head. 

This takes place sometime during the early months of the Amoni-Ram initiative (you can tell because neither of them have fuladh on themselves) (you can also tell because come on, Robert would definitely be the type to make himself taller given the opportunity. Look me in the eyes and tell me throne-ridden Blackstar-troubled Bumaro-infused manipulate-mansplain-manboss Robert wouldn&#39;t be the type to elongate himself. You can&#39;t)
