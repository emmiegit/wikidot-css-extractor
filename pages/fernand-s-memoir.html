//Notes from Dr. Bernstein&#39;s personal audio journal://

&gt; **10.27.2016:** [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-082 SCP-082] made an unusual request this afternoon. Instead of asking for clothes like it usually does, it asked for a set of books. Specifically, it asked for books of poetry, as well as an issue of //Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus//. SCP-082 has also asked for a stack of paper, along with a quill. All requests have been approved, and the materials should arrive by tomorrow morning. Since its request, SCP-082 has refused all food and water, and sits quietly in its chamber. Quite peculiar behavior for a skip so amiable...Well, as amiable as an 8 foot cannibal can be.

&gt; **10.28.2016:** Ever since SCP-082 has gotten those books, it&#39;s been reading and writing nonstop. I&#39;ve been surveying it for five hours and it hasn&#39;t taken a single break. It has used up three full stacks of paper already, most of which is crumpled on the floor. What the hell is it up to?

&gt; **10.31.2016:** I have never seen 082 this happy before. When I came into my shift this morning, it was still writing. It&#39;s been listening to more upbeat music and I saw it dancing to some of the tunes. If someone told me that I would spend my day watching a 700 pound cannibal dance like a ballerina, while writing poetry, and humming to Chopin, I&#39;d laugh in their face. 

&gt; **11.3.2016:** Still writing. It&#39;s still writing. Over the past few days, it&#39;s gone through ten stacks of paper. Well, I guess this is better than eating off the heads of the D-class. 
&gt; 
&gt; 082 spoke to me today. It said that it wished to read me a piece of poetry that it wrote. Oddly, it seemed quite genuine with its emotion. I told it that it could read it to me tomorrow, as it was 11 at night, and I needed to go to bed. 082 seemed alright with it, and I headed home. What the hell did I get myself into?

**Foreword: The following is an interview of SCP-082 by Dr. Bernstein, head of SCP-082&#39;s containment.**

&gt; [BEGIN LOG (11.4.2016)]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Bernstein:** What exactly did you want to show us, 082?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-082:** It is a piece of literature that I have written. I&#39;m quite proud of it. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Bernstein:** *sigh* Alright then. Go ahead, 082.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-082:** One moment please. I just need to reorganize my pages. (papers rustling) My apologies. I&#39;m not normally this flustered...I&#39;m ready.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Bernstein:** Any time, 082.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-082:** Here we go. And--and do be warned. This is the first piece of poetry I have written. It will not be perfect.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Bernstein:** I&#39;m sure it&#39;s fine 082. Go on and read it.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-082:** Alright. Here we go. (clears throat)
&gt; 
&gt; In the dank, deep depths of the dark alleyway,
&gt; Where no man can see the light of day,
&gt; There stood a boy wearing tattered attire,
&gt; And, in the corner, a small campfire.
&gt; With rags as a sleeping mat, and a box for a house,
&gt; And laying there, quiet as a mouse,
&gt; The boy knew not to make any sound,
&gt; For he knew what would happen if he were to be found.
&gt; 
&gt; While sleeping in his cot, the boy slept well,
&gt; And felt, as a whole, rather swell.
&gt; The boy woke the next morning, hearing a shout,
&gt; And from his cot, he began to sprout.
&gt; Looking to the light, he saw a figure,
&gt; Though its full shape, he could not configure.
&gt; Two more entered sight, all were a blur.
&gt; Should the boy run? He was unsure.
&gt; 
&gt; The figures came charging at a rapid motion,
&gt; Nothing could be heard over the commotion.
&gt; They grabbed the boys limbs, and pulled him madly,
&gt; The boy had to flee, but he could not, sadly.
&gt; Trapped by the figures, he was unable to walk,
&gt; With a cloth over his mouth, he was unable to talk.
&gt; With a thump on the head, his world became dark,
&gt; And along with the men, they disembarked.
&gt; 
&gt; With a groggy grunt, the boy awoke with tears,
&gt; He was locked in a cage, the worst of his fears.
&gt; Draped in red, he could not see,
&gt; With bars of steel, he could not flee.
&gt; There was a rustle, then a light so bright,
&gt; The boy had almost lost his sight.
&gt; Then, a man, with a twinkle in his eye
&gt; Grabbed a cane and top hat, then began to outcry:
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Ladies and gentlemen, children of any age!
&gt; Allow me to show you what is in this cage.
&gt; Around the world, I&#39;ve travelled, sea to sea,
&gt; And I have brought a gift for thee to see.
&gt; Be warned, you may run crying in fear,
&gt; And this gift may also cause you to tear.
&gt; But fret not, my dears, for it will cause no harm
&gt; For if he does, I&#39;ll cut off his arm!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;This great, hefty beast has arms so strong,
&gt; That he could cut down trees all year long.
&gt; Yes, it&#39;s true, this beast has some muscle,
&gt; He could certainly proclaim victory in any tussle.
&gt; But folks, if you will have a look at this creature!
&gt; We must not neglect his most prominent feature.
&gt; With jaws of steel, and teeth so bright,
&gt; This creature&#39;s smile could light up the night!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; The man turned to the boy, scowl on his face,
&gt; He whispered, &#34;Come on, beast, pick up the pace!
&gt; Your audience is waiting, give em&#39; a show!&#34;
&gt; The man took the cane, then delivered a blow.
&gt; The boy shook with fear, not knowing what to do,
&gt; The audience before him began to boo.
&gt; With one last breath that reeked of bile,
&gt; The boy stood tall, and then, he smiled.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers, cheers! Cheers all around!
&gt; Not a single frown was able to be found.
&gt; The man stepped forward, and said, &#34;How about that?&#34;
&gt; The crowd before him threw coins in his hat.
&gt; The man was rich, all thanks to the boy.
&gt; &#34;Perhaps,&#34; the man thought, &#34;there is more use for this toy&#34;
&gt; Then the man reached into a pocket in his back,
&gt; He pulled out a whip, and let out a //crack.//
&gt; 
&gt; Blood cre--...blood...uh...
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Bernstein:** Are you alright, 082?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-082:** Yes...yes of course. Where was I? Oh yes:
&gt; 
&gt; Blood crept down the boy&#39;s back, as thick as molasses.
&gt; Brought to his knees, right before the masses.
&gt; The boy let out a roar, all could hear.
&gt; The crowd shrieked, then ran in fear.
&gt; The man chuckled, and looked at the boy,
&gt; Then said, &#34;Oh come now, don&#39;t be so coy.
&gt; From here on out, I&#39;ll be your guide.
&gt; And, together, we shall travel far and wide!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Days passed like months, and months like years.
&gt; Each day he was alive, he bathed in tears.
&gt; Was this his place, his final destination?
&gt; Is this life his only true application?
&gt; Whatever questions he asked, no one answered the boy.
&gt; For what was he if he not a toy?
&gt; It took many years, and much contemplation,
&gt; But at last, the boy received an explanation.
&gt; 
&gt; In the crypts of his mind, there came a voice.
&gt; This voice allowed the poor boy a choice.
&gt; Shall he remain in his cage, filled with dejection?
&gt; Or shall he get revenge with divine retaliation?
&gt; The boy stared at his thousands of scars,
&gt; Then brought his attention to the light of the stars.
&gt; In order to escape, the boy needed a plan,
&gt; But most of all, he must become a man.
&gt; 
&gt; It was the last day of the tour, the final show
&gt; What would happen? The boy did not know.
&gt; The man in the hat came out from the back.
&gt; He took out his whip, then gave another crack.
&gt; Still locked in his cage, the boy could not fight.
&gt; All he could do was shake with fright.
&gt; The man just chuckled, not giving a care.
&gt; He grabbed his cane, and gave one last declare:
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Now folks, hear me, as I tell you my feat!
&gt; I stand here, offering you all a treat.
&gt; After many years of teaching and rehabilitation,
&gt; I present this beast to the entire nation!
&gt; For he is no longer a beast, no longer so cruel,
&gt; And with my teachings, he is now my mule.
&gt; Don&#39;t believe me, you say? Need I show you?&#34;
&gt; The man then unlocked the cage, and out the door flew.
&gt; 
&gt; Slowly, the boy inched from his crib,
&gt; To encourage him, the man jabbed him in the rib.
&gt; Picking up the pace, the boy made it out,
&gt; The audience before him let out a shout.
&gt; &#34;Beast!&#34; they called him. &#34;Abomination!&#34; they cried,
&gt; The boy could not smile, no matter how much he tried.
&gt; The man beside him, with eyes full of rage,
&gt; Shouted at the boy, while hitting the cage.
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Come on, my boy! What are you doing?
&gt; Can you not see that the audience is booing?
&gt; After all these years, and all of this time,
&gt; Now is when you decide to begrime?
&gt; Show them your power, show them your might!
&gt; For I know that you&#39;re human, just ever so slight.
&gt; Show them how a beast like you does no harm.
&gt; For if you don&#39;t, I will saw off your arm!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; The boy stood still, unable to move.
&gt; He could not find his internal groove.
&gt; The crypts of his mind internally froze,
&gt; Then suddenly, in front of him, a shadow arose.
&gt; The shadow engulfed the boy, entrapped his soul,
&gt; Then slowly and quietly, it began to cajole.
&gt; Finally, the boy knew what must be done,
&gt; And chuckled to himself, &#34;Let&#39;s have some fun.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; The boy grabbed his captor, and held him tight.
&gt; He stared into his eyes, and saw the fright.
&gt; As the boy lifted the man, the man screamed in fear.
&gt; From his left eye, the boy saw him tear. 
&gt; The boy did not care, he had no remorse,
&gt; For he knew that this man was truly so coarse.
&gt; The boy opened his jaws, and placed the man inside.
&gt; And though it was muffled, the man still cried.
&gt; 
&gt; He squirmed in his mouth, as the boy began to munch,
&gt; Then he grew limp with one final **CRUNCH**.
&gt; 
&gt; //(SCP-082 is silent for a minute, and then continues)//
&gt; 
&gt; Blood gushed in the boy&#39;s mouth, it was quite a sight.
&gt; Still, unrelenting, the boy held on tight.
&gt; For he was no longer a boy, much more vicious and malicious.
&gt; As he devoured the man&#39;s flesh, he whispered, &#34;How delicious.&#34;
&gt; Still wanting more, he turned to the crowd,
&gt; Who had already started running and screaming aloud.
&gt; The beast chased after, grabbing a few.
&gt; He ripped off their arms, then began to chew.
&gt; 
&gt; After those few, he grabbed some more.
&gt; He ripped out their entrails, which leaked on the floor.
&gt; After those meals, he ran to the street.
&gt; He feasted on those with livers so sweet.
&gt; In the corner of his eye, he saw a young man,
&gt; With a pair of ripped trousers, and a gun in his hand.
&gt; Though he tried to take on the beast,
&gt; It was upon his corpse that the beast would feast.
&gt; 
&gt; But before the beast could go any more,
&gt; He took a look down, and stared at the gore,
&gt; For this boy was like him, alone and afraid,
&gt; With no one else who would give him aid.
&gt; The beast was now alone, blood creeping in his scars,
&gt; No one could see him except for the stars.
&gt; With much shame, the beast fled the scene,
&gt; For he did not know how he could be this obscene.
&gt; 
&gt; He took shelter in the woods, unable to cope
&gt; With the actions he made; he was out of hope.
&gt; He washed himself in a nearby river,
&gt; Scraping off the remnants of the young man&#39;s liver.
&gt; He grabbed some leaves, and then some sticks,
&gt; Then made a small cot, in which he affixed
&gt; A small drape for a door, and some leaves that were dead,
&gt; This was the only things the beast could call his bed.
&gt; 
&gt; //(SCP-082 begins to tear, but continues to speak)//
&gt; 
&gt; After the night passed, he awoke in a room,
&gt; With many bright lights, and a mood so gloom.
&gt; There were people above, staring at the aberration.
&gt; The creature then knew the reality of the situation.
&gt; His life flashed again, all of the pain,
&gt; All the creature could do was exclaim.
&gt; For he was again alone, with nothing to do.
&gt; Then, a voice from above said, &#34;Hello, 082.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; //(SCP-082 breaks down into a fit of crying)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Bernstein:** Is that...is that all 082?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-082:** (sniffs) Yes...yes that is all. Thank you for your time.
&gt; 
&gt; //(SCP-082 travels to the corner of the containment chamber and sits, facing the wall)//
