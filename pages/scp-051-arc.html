**Item #:** SCP-051

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-051 is to be kept in the secure section of Site-██&#39;s motor pool. All access to SCP-051 is restricted to personnel with Level 4 clearance or personnel responsible for SCP-051&#39;s maintenance. Any unauthorized use of SCP-051 will be met with severe punitive measures.

**Description:** SCP-051 can best be described as a &#34;flying jeep&#34;, even though it does not use the same chassis or design, nor was it made by any jeep manufacturer. SCP-051 was a secret Allied World War II weapons project exploring the use of short range flying vehicles. Because all pertinent files of SCP-051 have either been lost or destroyed since its creation, very little is known about SCP-051&#39;s history, and whether it had any impact in World War II. It is theorized that ███████████ ███████ Labs was responsible for the creation of SCP-051 due to recently recovered data that refers to their World War II projects. However, due to the destruction of ███████████ ███████ Labs as well as the disappearance or death of the original design team, such theories are impossible to confirm at this time.

Through intense study of SCP-051&#39;s construction and mechanical parts, Foundation engineers have determined that SCP-051 is capable of achieving flight as well as operate as a normal ground-based vehicle and can carry up to 318 kg, though it is quite possible to load up to 590 kg if needed. Flight testing has also shown that SCP-051 has a top speed of 220 km/h and a service ceiling of 1000 m. However, even with thorough analysis, Foundation engineers have been unable to determine the exact nature of the mechanisms that allow SCP-051 to achieve flight. What is known, though, is that said mechanisms are powered by a standard internal combustion engine. The engine itself is not required for flight, though. The SCP-051&#39;s original World War II-era engine had been replaced with a more modern engine without any detriment to SCP-051&#39;s performance. SCP-051 also does not need any special power source other than what its engine requires. Currently, SCP-051 is running off a diesel engine that can be powered by a range of fuels, including standard diesel gasoline, biofuel, and refined cooking oil. There are currently projects to make SCP-051 more environmentally friendly through the use of fuel cells, solar power, and electric batteries.

SCP-051 initially came to the Foundation&#39;s attention in 19██ when a World War II archivist came across photographs of SCP-051 in operation and began distributing them to colleagues. Agents managed to intercept the photos and convince the parties involved that SCP-051 was an elaborate hoax. However, analysis of the photos revealed that the photographs were completely genuine. SCP-051&#39;s existence was soon corroborated when sightings of a &#34;flying jeep&#34; began to surface in ████████, ██████. Further details on the recovery of SCP-051 can be found in Incident Report 051a. 

//A flying jeep? Shit, we can&#39;t let Kondraki near this thing! - Dr. ██████//

**Addendum 1:** Since SCP-051 has been taken to Site-██, UFO sightings from the surrounding areas have increased by 500%. --The matter is currently under investigation.--

**Addendum 2:** As of ██/██/20██, security measures around SCP-051 have been increased and access has been restricted to Level 4 personnel only.

//For the last time, SCP-051 is not to be used for recreational purposes! If I catch anybody else joyriding on it, it&#39;s Keter duty for the whole Site! - O5-██.//

**Addendum 3:** Recent declassification of Nazi documents reveal a psychiatric evaluation of the remnants of an SS battalion who claimed that they had fallen under attack by several dozen &#34;flying jeeps&#34;. The implications that there may be multiple copies of SCP-051 in existence must now be taken seriously.

//You mean there can be more of these things out there? If we find them, what&#39;s going to stop the Site staff from racing them? - O5-██//

//Please stop giving the Site staff ideas. Their respect for authority is already tenuous at best. - O5-██//</textarea></pre>
