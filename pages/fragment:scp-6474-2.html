**Special Containment Procedures:** --Widespread awareness of SCP-6474 and its effects among Foundation personnel is to be avoided-- --to be avoided at all costs-- --to be disseminated-- Any members of the Foundation with --promising-- proposals for the containment of SCP-6474 and the reversal of its effects are to speak to their direct supervisor immediately. 

A team of 50 researchers led by the directors of Site-12, -18, and -21 are to work continuously to transcribe any and all Foundation documents associated with affected individuals by hand. Any individual wishing to aid in this pursuit is to speak to their direct supervisor immediately.

Re-establishing communication and reversing the symptoms of patients 0-3 is considered top priority.

**Description:** SCP-6474 is a retrocausal[[footnote]]The present leads to the state of the past instead of causal, where the past leads to the state of the present.[[/footnote]] phenomenon that removes any and all spoken communications in an individual&#39;s history from baseline reality. Effectively, the affected individual is believed to have never spoken. Media which would have recorded the speech of affected individuals, including tapes and video logs, also have any spoken communication by affected individuals removed. This effect does not extend to transcripts.

It is not yet known how an individual is affected. 

The effect would have first occurred between 05/01/2028 and 10/01/2028. This has been discerned by considering patients 0, 1, and 2, who are currently experiencing later stages of exposure. 

||**Subject**||||**Name**||||**Current Status**||
||Patient 0|||| Pertiwi Wahyu AKA &#34;NULLS&#34;||||Fell into a coma on 11/28/2028 and is unresponsive. Patient is effectively brain-dead when surroundings are completely quiet. When in the presence of any sound, brain activity exhibits signs of hearing a deafening volume. Revival attempts are ongoing.||
||Patient 1|||| Solomon Xiong - AKA &#34;ROYAL&#34;||||Exhibited no unusual behavior until 11/29/2028  when he was tackled and restrained in the Site-17 cafeteria after quietly using tweezers to tear out both eardrums.||
||Patient 2|||| Sola Luciana - AKA &#34;VOICE&#34; ||||Subject has not exhibited further uncharacteristic activity beyond a new obsession with blank sheets of paper. [EDIT 11/31/2028] Baseline reality contains consistent evidence that Sola Luciana has always been illiterate, but prior SCP documentation suggests this is not the case.||
||Patient 3||||Petya Ilyovich - AKA &#34;RUST&#34;||||No deviation from usual behavior yet. Patient is under close observation and given aptitude tests four times a day. Since patient&#39;s husband has been hospitalized following attempted suicide by drowning, patient has also been provided with regular counseling.||

**Discovery:** A review of established information for the prior version of SCP-6474 was ordered by the O5 Council. This was prompted by the number of Foundation personnel who had not spoken since birth reporting to their supervisor. During the week of 11/12/2028, 0.34% of Foundation employees reported to their supervisors. During the week of 11/19/2028, this increased to 4.5% of Foundation employees. During the past week, 18.7% of the Foundation had submitted some report, or had an associate submit a report on their behalf, confirming their status. 3% of Foundation employees had an associate submit a report on their behalf because these employees have always been illiterate. All employees that had submitted a report were found to have similar &#34;alterations&#34; made to associated documentation.

When the Foundation recovers from this, additional safety precautions will be put in place to verify changes in baseline reality.

The most likely origin point for SCP-6474 is deemed the same as SCP-████ in Indonesia where the above four conducted an exploratory mission. On 11/24/2028, an expedition of 240 Foundation personnel to this location was completed. Massive digging and several tunneling platoons brought lighting and measuring equipment to the cavern where commanding officer Pertiwi Wahyu encountered the anomalous subject. All safety protocols were in place in this second expedition, and it was confirmed that the hermetic seal Petya Ilyovich placed on the chamber was still intact prior to entering.

For sake of reference, the chamber has been named The Nulls Chamber. Lighting equipment was brought into the cave and a complete exploration of the area was done. 
The Nulls Chamber had the following qualities:
* A height of over 200 meters, a width of 900 meters, and a length of 1.2 km. 
* Dense silence. Sound traveled less distance when compared to the same sound outside the chamber. 
* A thin but incredibly deep hole, which extends beyond the mantle of the Earth. Two drones were dispatched to explore further. Instead of lava, the bottom only contained a small quantity of white water. Notably, this defied gravity and was flowing up the wall of the &#34;well&#34;. A sample of the water showed trace amounts of sulfur, carbon, and potassium nitrate[[footnote]]A common combination for gunpowder[[/footnote]] when tested within the cavern, but outside of the cavern the sample only contained H,,2,,O.

Nothing further out of the ordinary was found. Heightening the resolution on Pertiwi Wahyu&#39;s video from initial exploration is considered a top priority.

SCP documentation is considered the official record of true baseline reality before it was affected by SCP-6474. All dialogue that was removed previously has been restored.

[[collapsible show=&#34;REST OF THE DOCUMENT IS RESTRICTED TO LEVEL 4 CLEARANCE OR ABOVE. ENTER CREDENTIALS.&#34; hide=&#34;- CLEARED&#34;]]

During Junior Researcher Alphonso Zahar&#39;s daily survey on 11/31/2028, he turned in a set of blank notebooks. He believed these to have been journals of Sola Luciana. Prior documentation corroborates this.
