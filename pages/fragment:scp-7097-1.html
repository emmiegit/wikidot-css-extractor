**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7097 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. LCD displays are to constantly stream reality TV programs, and triple-wide ventilation systems are to diffuse various perfumes in one-hour intervals.

**Addendum-7097-1 (01-27-2023):** A minimum of --two-- 250,000 live female Drosophila specimens are to be contained near SCP-7097&#39;s cell.

**Description:** SCP-7097 is a sapient entity that inhabits female members of the Drosophila genus,[[footnote]]Commonly known as fruit flies.[[/footnote]] and has a strong proclivity for learning and/or sharing personal secrets.

SCP-7097 will inhabit the nearest suitable Drosophila specimen after dying, with no noticeable change in personality or mannerisms. The entity is fully aware of this and may attempt breach-by-suicide if insufficiently entertained. If sufficiently entertained, SCP-7097 will become dormant and unresponsive.
 
SCP-7097 has an innate sense for secrets, which testing determined is a form of anomalous olfactory detection. SCP-7097 often utilizes this sense during communication, and it has been known to make unsolicited remarks about Foundation staff and/or initiate games such as truth or dare.

**Foreword:** As SCP-7097 neared the end of its natural one-month lifespan, Dr. Mendoza instructed Dr. Kelly and Dr. Landstrom to procure two Drosophila specimens suitable for containment purposes.

**Dr. Kelly:** Alright, the jars are secure.

**Dr. Kelly [whispering]:** Couldn&#39;t we at least give her some painkillers?

**Closing Statement:** SCP-7097 was located in the women&#39;s restroom making unflattering statements about Site Director Max Maxwell&#39;s alopecia. Following Dr. Landstrom&#39;s refusal to //&#34;go in there like some peeping Tom,&#34;// Dr. Kelly was dispatched to re-contain the entity and successfully returned it to its cell.

SCP-7097&#39;s cell amenities list has been updated to include the following, per Dr. Kelly&#39;s request:

**Foreword:** Following SCP-7097&#39;s second breach in under one month, Site Director Max Maxwell called Dr. Mendoza to inquire about the entity&#39;s continued containment.
 _
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
 _

= **[Audio Only Log, 18:43 hours]**
 _
**Director Maxwell:** What the //hell// is going on with that fly? 
 _
**Dr. Mendoza:** I apologize for the recent events, sir. SCP-7097&#39;s abilities make containment more challenging than usual, and-
 _
**Director Maxwell:** Look, I&#39;m not concerned with the details right now. Just tell me this: what do you need to contain it?
 _
**Dr. Mendoza:** Well, we will need at least 250,000 Drosophila-
 _
**Director Maxwell:** //250,000 flies?!?//
 _
**Dr. Mendoza [muttering]:** Well, actually 500,000 since half of them are non-viable...
 _
**Director Maxwell:** Your division is already //well// over budget, Vera, thanks to that fly&#39;s ludicrous bandwidth usage. Not to mention the fact that I still hear people muttering //&#34;Waxy Maxy&#34;// in the halls. Do you have any idea how much constructing another fly farm would //cost?//
 _
**Dr. Mendoza:** I understand, sir, but there&#39;s no other way to contain the entity securely.
 _
**Director Maxwell:** Then try something else.
 _
**Dr. Mendoza:** ...Something else?
 _
**Director Maxwell:** I&#39;m authorizing termination experiments; that //thing// has racked up enough expenses to warrant it by now.
 _
**Dr. Mendoza:** If I may, sir, this goes against typical Foundation- 
 _
**Director Maxwell:** Just do it, Vera. I&#39;ll sign off on your suggestions if the fly survives.
[[/div]]
 _
**Foreword:** At the Site Director&#39;s request, seven jars were procured that each contained one Drosophila specimen and a unique remote execution method. SCP-7097 was relocated to the termination chamber while dormant, at which point a D-class was escorted there and given one standard-issue flyswatter.

**D-14378:** Alright, I guess. Here goes nothing.

**D-14378 [sheepish]:** Backscratcher.

**Dr. Mendoza:** SCP-7097, do //not// interact with the D-class.

//Dr. Mendoza activates the switch in jar one, releasing pyrethrin gas. SCP-7097 expires and inhabits the specimen in jar two.//

**SCP-7097:** Hey, what&#39;d you do that for?
 _
//Dr. Mendoza activates the switch in jar two, releasing rapid-acting silica gel from a separate chamber. SCP-7097 expires via dehydration.//
 _
**SCP-7097:** Haha, very funny. Now cut it out!
 _
//Dr. Mendoza activates the switch in jar three, releasing a separate chamber containing one dragonfly. SCP-7097 begins being devoured messily.//

**Dr. Kelly [to Dr. Mendoza]:** This... this isn&#39;t right.

**Dr. Mendoza [to Dr. Kelly]:** It&#39;s just research, Grace. Besides, flies can&#39;t even //feel// pain.

**Dr. Mendoza:** Stop! SCP-7097, we can administer gaseous painkillers so long as you continue.
 _
**SCP-7097:** I don&#39;t want drugs! Just take me out of here!
 _
**Dr. Kelly [to Dr. Mendoza]:** Can&#39;t we just call it quits for today?
 _
**Dr. Mendoza [to Dr. Kelly]:** I already promised Director Maxwell information on all seven execution methods, and I am not going to fail to deliver now.

//Dr. Mendoza allows Dr. Kelly to speak with SCP-7097.//

**SCP-7097:** Grace, oh thank God! You&#39;re gonna get me out of here, right?
 _
**Dr. Kelly:** Listen, we&#39;ve got to run some more experiments. I know it&#39;s not what you want, but I promise I&#39;ll make it up to you.
 _
**SCP-7097:** If I do it, can I spend my birthday with your friends?
 _
//Dr. Kelly stares at Dr. Mendoza. She approves, with great reluctance.//
 _
**Dr. Kelly:** Yes, and I&#39;ll throw you a party too! Now can you be brave for me?
 _
**SCP-7097:** I will!
 _
[[/div]]
 _
**Researcher&#39;s Note:** SCP-7097 cooperated with all subsequent experiments, though none succeeded in permanently terminating the entity. Termination attempts on SCP-7097 are to be suspended for the foreseeable future in light of this, and the Drosophila supply is to be gradually increased to 500,000 as construction of a new fly farm takes place.

//Dr. Landstrom uses an olfactory testing rod[[footnote]]The olfactory testing rods, developed curtesy of Dr. Landstrom, contain a mixture of sweat and pheromones designed to trigger SCP-7097&#39;s olfactory sense.[[/footnote]] on a Drosophila specimen. No effect.//

//Dr. Landstrom uses the rod on another Drosophila specimen, again without any effect.//

//SCP-7097 perks up.//

 _
**Dr. Landstrom:** 7097! There you are!
 _
**SCP-7097:** Nice to finally meet you! And by the way, you can call me Cassidy.
 _
**Dr. Landstrom:** We&#39;ve met before, haven&#39;t we?
 _
**SCP-7097:** That was all work stuff though. I’ve never met someone when they didn&#39;t //[plays recorded audio of Dr. Kelly]// //&#34;still have a job to do.&#34;//

**Dr. Landstrom:** Michael.

//Dr. Landstrom extends a pinky finger to the entity. They attempt a “handshake.”//

**Dr. Landstrom:** Listen, Cassidy. Would you please come back to your cell? I know Dr. Mendoza can be a pain, but you’ve got a good thing going. You’ll be fed, given the best entertainment money can buy, and Grace and I will visit whenever we can. What could be better than //all that?//

 _
**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** No way Jose, I wanna talk to all your friends!
 _
**Dr. Landstrom [muttering]:** What friends? I mean, I don’t really feel like talking to them right now.
 _
**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** I //see.// You’re a little deficient in the conversational department, aren&#39;t you?
 _
//Dr. Landstrom orders his meal, and waits at the pickup counter.//
 _
**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** Well not to worry! I’m, like, the best talker in the history of talking. Not to brag or anything.
 _
**Dr. Landstrom [muttering]:** Yeah, I kind of noticed. Also, how does that help me in any way?
 _
**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** We help //each other,// genius. I wanna get out and talk to people, and you wanna keep your foot out of your mouth, right? So let me do the talking, and we’ll both win!

**Dr. Kelly:** Hey Mike!
 _
**Dr. Landstrom [muttering]:** //Shut up.//
 _
**Dr. Kelly:** Excuse me?

**Dr. Landstrom [flustered]:** Uh, nothing. Nice to, erm, see you.

**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** Quite the gentleman, aren’t you? Look, just follow my lead and you’ll be golden. //Got it?//
 _
//Dr. Landstrom &#34;mhms&#34; quietly.//
 _
**Dr. Kelly:** So, how’s the search for Cassidy going?
 _
**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** Tell her you haven’t found me yet, but that she will because she’s naturally good with bugs.
 _
**Dr. Landstrom:** No luck yet, but I’m sure you’ll find it before I do. You’ve got a buggy sense.
 _
**Dr. Kelly:** //Buggy sense?//
 _
**Dr. Landstrom:** Erm, that is to say, your sense is good when it comes to bugs. Not that your senses are defective per se, but rather-
 _
//Dr. Kelly laughs.//
 _
**Dr. Kelly:** That’s pretty funny Mike.
 _
**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** //Buggy sense?// What the hell was //that?// Good lord, you’re lucky this woman’s sense of humor is nearly as weird as yours.
 _
//Dr. Landstrom laughs nervously.//
 _
**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** Alright, here&#39;s the game plan. Today&#39;s Wednesday, which means Grace is wearing a green earring, right?[[footnote]]Dr. Kelly wears a different accessory for each day of the week, with the colors corresponding to those of the rainbow.[[/footnote]]
 _
**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** Don’t worry, you don’t need to nod or anything. I //know// I’m right because I’m such a people person, just saying. Anyways, tell her those earrings look really cute.
 _
**Dr. Landstrom:** I like your earrings. Most people wear chromium emeralds, but yours are clearly vanadium-based which, erm, produces a stronger color.
 _
**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** I was going more for //&#34;they match your eyes&#34;,// but whatever.
 _
**Dr. Kelly:** Thanks! I like to mix it up every day, but most people don&#39;t even notice. Just you and Cassidy, funnily enough.
 _
**Dr. Landstrom:** You mean the skip?
 _
**Dr. Kelly:** Yeah, she always remembered little things like that. //[sighs]// And she always had something nice to say when I visited.
 _
**Dr. Landstrom:** Interesting, for a common Drosophila specimen to have a memory that strong is quite atypical. I&#39;ll have to add a note about this in my insect compendi- OW!
 _
**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** Can it with the nerd-speak //genius,// or I&#39;ll yank another hair.
 _
**Dr. Kelly:** Are you alright?  
 _
**Dr. Landstrom:** Yes, just a little headache is all. You were saying about Cassidy?
 _
//Dr. Kelly is silent for several seconds.//
 _
**Dr. Kelly:** I feel sorry for her.
 _
**Dr Landstrom:** You //what?//
 _
**Dr. Kelly [flustered]:** I mean, how would you like it if you were forced to live in a prison without any true friends? We treat her like some monster, but all she wants to do is... live a normal life. 
 _
**Dr. Landstrom:** It has you, doesn&#39;t it? How can you say you&#39;re not a true friend when you visited that thing practically every day?
 _
**Dr. Kelly:** //[sighs]// I made a promise to her, and then left her alone when she needed me most. I really liked spending time with Cassidy, but when push came to shove I was more worried about keeping my job than keeping my word.
 _
**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** She really //did// care...
 _
**Dr. Kelly:** I just wish I could make things right with Cassidy somehow, but every time I ask-
 _
//Dr. Landstrom laughs hysterically.//
 _
**Dr. Kelly:** Huh?
 _
**Dr. Landstrom:** //[laughing]// It&#39;s not- //[hunches over from laughing]// -I can&#39;t...
 _
**Dr. Kelly:** I&#39;m being serious here!
 _
//Dr. Landstrom makes his way to the nearest bathroom, laughing along the way.//
 _
**Dr. Landstrom:** What the hell? The deal was for you to help me hold a conversation, not tickle my scalp when we&#39;re having a moment!
 _
//Dr. Landstrom takes off his hat, revealing the entity.//
 _
**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** Hey, I needed to get your attention somehow!
 _
**Dr. Landstrom:** And what was so important you had to embarrass me like that?
 _
**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** Listen, I need you to bring Dr. Kelly here. It&#39;s about the only place where the cameras won&#39;t be watching,[[footnote]]SCP-7097 was wrong about that.[[/footnote]] and-
 _
**Dr. Landstrom:** You want me to bring a //woman// into the //men&#39;s restroom?!?//
 _
**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** Well it sounds pervy when you put it //that// way.
 _
**Dr. Landstrom [blushing]:** It //is// pervy! 
 _
**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** Just tell her there&#39;s something in here you need to show her. She&#39;ll trust you, I&#39;m sure of-
 _
**Dr. Landstrom:** //[head in hands]// Do you have any idea how that //sounds?// 
 _
**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** I promise I&#39;ll make it up to you, alright?
 _
**Dr. Landstrom:** //[pauses]// No.
 _
**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** C&#39;mon, I&#39;m not asking for that-
 _
**Dr. Landstrom:** I have a better idea.
 _
//Dr. Landstrom returns to the cafeteria. Dr. Kelly is by herself.//
 _
**Dr. Kelly:** There you are! What happened?
 _
**Dr. Landstrom:** Oh, uh... indigestion.
 _
**Dr. Kelly:** Indigestion that made you laugh hysterically?
 _
**Dr. Landstrom [sheepish]:** Yep.
 _
**Dr. Kelly:** //[raises one eyebrow]// ...Anyways, I just wish I could apologize to Cassidy. She deserves to be treated like a person, instead of being locked up in a cell all by herself.
 _
**Dr. Landstrom:** You want to //apologize// to a Keter-class anomaly?
 _
**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** Whose side are you even //on?//
 _
**Dr. Kelly [chuckling]:** Now you sound like Dr. Mendoza.
 _
**Dr. Landstrom [chuckling]:** Hey, those are fighting words! 
 _
**Dr. Kelly:** Seriously though, I wish Vera could see Cassidy as more than just a problem to be locked away.
 _
**Dr. Landstrom:** Or, you know, that Dr. Mendoza would smile and act like a //normal human// once in a blue moon.
 _
//Dr. Kelly laughs.//
 _
//Dr. Landstrom finishes his meal and gets up.//
 _
**Dr. Landstrom:** Well, erm, see ya.
 _
**Dr. Kelly:** See you later.
 _
//Dr. Landstrom begins walking away from the table.//
 _
**Dr. Kelly:** Oh, and one more thing Mike...
 _
//Dr. Kelly pauses for a moment.//
 _
**Dr. Kelly:** I like this side of you. You should show it more often.
 _
//Dr. Landstrom leaves, before wincing in pain.//
 _
**Dr. Landstrom [muttering]:** Alright, alright! I&#39;ll tell her, just stop yanking my hair follicles!
 _
**Dr. Landstrom:** Grace, would you, erm, mind trying on this hat for a sec?
 _
**Dr. Kelly:** Uh, sure?
 _
**Dr. Landstrom:** I just think it would really complement your hairstyle and-
 _
**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** //This// is what you call a //better// idea?
 _
//Dr. Landstrom takes the Metallica hat off and passes it toward Dr. Kelly.//
 _
**Dr. Kelly:** What a day...
 _
//Dr. Kelly receives the hat but is interrupted by Foundation security agents before she can put it on. Both researchers, the entity, and numerous nearby staff members are incapacitated via sonic attack.//
 _
**Dr. Landstrom [barely conscious]:** Tell... me... about... it...
 _
[[/div]]
 _
**Closing Statement:** The entity was re-contained in a quarantine cell following this incident, and Dr. Landstrom had to be detained with it due to unintended consequences of re-containment. A request was filed by Dr. Kelly to release Dr. Landstrom and allow SCP-7097 out of its cell periodically.
 _
**Request denied.**
