&#34;What the hell, dude?&#34; Junior Researcher Lee turned to walk back out the door. &#34;I don&#39;t want to talk to you while you&#39;re taking a piss.&#34;

&#34;No, don&#39;t go,&#34; Junior Researcher McKinney called out from the urinal. &#34;See, that&#39;s the problem.&#34;

Pausing with uncertainty, Lee asked &#34;//What&#39;s// the problem?&#34;

&#34;When did I send you those texts?&#34;

Lee checked his phone. &#34;Like, two minutes ago.&#34;

&#34;I&#39;ve been here that whole time.&#34;

Lee hesitated again. &#34;You mean here... peeing?&#34;

&#34;Yeah! And for two minutes before then too.&#34;

&#34;What! How?&#34;

&#34;I don&#39;t know man, //that&#39;s// the problem! Is this an anomaly?&#34;

&#34;Well... It doesn&#39;t sound normal.&#34;

&#34;Shit! What do I do?&#34;

&#34;Uuuhhh... Wait here a minute.&#34;

-----

&#34;Seriously?&#34;

&#34;Yes.&#34;

Security Officer Gomez was the first person Lee could find in the corridor, so he was here now. And his incredulous reaction wasn&#39;t appreciated, despite mostly masking his snickering. &#34;Alright, alright,&#34; he said, composing himself. &#34;Here, answer these questions.&#34;

Gomez asked each one, and McKinney replied:
* No, I am not currently carrying or in possession of any anomalous objects.
* No, as far as I&#39;m aware I have not been exposed to any anomalous influences in the course of research or testing.
* No, I have not had access to any anomalous objects or creatures beyond those specifically assigned to me.

&#34;Ok, last thing. Where were you and what were you doing immediately before this began?&#34;

&#34;I was in Testing Chamber 209, documenting initial assessment on some Anomalous Object. It&#39;s still there; I just left for a second to use the bathrooms.&#34;

&#34;Mmm-hmm... Wait here a minute.&#34;

-----

&#34;Stream uninterrupted? This whole time?&#34;

&#34;Yes!&#34;

Researcher Nemitt&#39;s open fascination may have been even more offputting than Gomez&#39;s reaction. &#34;How do you feel? Is there any discomfort or pressure on your bladder? Are you becoming dehydrated?&#34;

&#34;Um, no? Er, I don&#39;t think I am. I feel... alright, I guess. Like, it doesn&#39;t hurt or anything.&#34;

&#34;Subject expresses no symptoms of physical discomfort,&#34; Lee practiced his clinical tone, privately hoping that the more experienced Dr. Nemitt would use it in the official report. &#34;I will now collect a material sample for our-&#34;

&#34;//I&#39;ll// do that!&#34; McKinney reached back over his shoulder and took the cup from Lee, who shrugged indifferently.

&#34;Unfortunately, at this point we can&#39;t say with any certainty the total volume produced,&#34; said Dr. Nemitt, sounding almost dejected. &#34;However, given the amount of time this has gone on, it must be in excess of a normal human bladder&#39;s capacity. There are almost certainly some fascinating implications to this.&#34;

&#34;Like what?&#34; A nervous McKinney passed the cup back to the researchers.

&#34;Well, just wait here for a minute.&#34;

-----

&#34;Perhaps a memetic effect manufactured specifically to induce this effect? For some medical reason.&#34;

&#34;A localized temporal distension which is limited to the subject&#39;s urinary functions?&#34;

&#34;What about an extremely small portal to another dimension?&#34;[[footnote]] McKinney objected to that use of &#34;&#34;extremely&#34; small&#34;; despite established standards by relevant Foundation Departments&#34;[[/footnote]]

At least four additional Researchers were now crowded into the room, standing near the sinks and each one animatedly discussing their own theories for the phenomenon they were witnessing.

&#34;Hey, how are you holding up?&#34; Lee seemed to be the only person in the room who remained aware that McKinney, their colleague, was actually standing right there. &#34;Do you need anything?&#34;

McKinney shook his head. &#34;Nah, thanks.&#34; Then, trying to keep the mood light, added &#34;Actually, I kinda wish I&#39;d chosen a stall now, so I could sit down. My feet are killing me here.&#34; The two friends shared a small chuckle.

&#34;Well, hang in there pal.&#34; Lee clapped a reassuring hand on McKinney&#39;s shoulder. Recognizing the awkwardness of this he immediately pulled it back.

&#34;Whoa!&#34;

&#34;Alright, sorry. I didn&#39;t-&#34;

&#34;Hey! Hey, it stopped!&#34;

A chorus of every person in the room: &#34;What?&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m... I&#39;m done,&#34; McKinney raised a hand and shrugged. &#34;I finished.&#34;

&#34;What do you mean?&#34;

&#34;How?&#34;

&#34;What exactly happened?&#34;

&#34;I- I-&#34; stammered McKinney. &#34;I don&#39;t know; nothing. It just... stopped.&#34;

Everyone in the room silently contemplated the previous hour spent of the careers they dedicated their lives to.

&#34;Well... Wash your hands.&#34;</textarea></pre>
