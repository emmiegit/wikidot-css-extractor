+ SCP Foundation Secure Facility Dossier

**Official Designation:** SCP Foundation Glassford Hill Recreation and Containment Facility

**Site Identification Code:** REULLR-Site-169
[[/=]]

------
[[=]]
++ General Information
[[/=]]

**Site Function:** Site-169 is a small-scale Safe-class object containment site, as well as the Headquarters of the Anomalous Entity Engagement Division (AEED). It is primarily used for low-priority containment and recreation. 

**Founded:** 11 March 1985

**Founding Director:** Dr. A. Metanoia

**Location:** Glassford Hill, Yavapai County, Arizona, United States

**Cover Story:** Glassford Hill Historical Preservation Site[[footnote]]In the 1800s, Glassford Hill was the site of a signal fort used to send short-range messages using heliographs (a method of transmitting morse code by reflecting light off a mirror).[[/footnote]]

**Size:** 4 acres (surface exclusion zone)

++ Site Overview
[[/=]]

Site-169 is unique in that it is the only dedicated recreational facility currently maintained by the Foundation. Personnel are often confused to discover that Site-169 is not intended for employee recreation, but rather for anomaly recreation. Following standard AEED procedure, personnel at this site work with Safe-class and other low-risk anomalous objects to provide various services such as: counselling, outdoor time, organised sporting events, tabletop gaming, and group movie nights. 

[[div style=&#34;float:right;&#34;]]
[[include component:image-block name=sitemapsmollest.png|caption=Map of Site-169. Click to enlarge.|link=&#34;*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/secure-facility-dossier-site-169/sitemap2nd&#34;]]
[[/div]]

During containment breaches or equipment failure at other Sites, approved anomalies may be temporarily sent to Site-169 in order to reduce stress and increase cooperation. This is the most common reason for a SCP to be sent to Site-169, but not the only. Sentient SCPs who have received marks for good behaviour may be approved for a temporary &#34;vacation&#34; stay at Site-169, provided that their containment procedures can still be reasonably performed on-site. Conversely, sentient SCPs who are consistently non-cooperative or resistant to personnel may be sent to Site-169 to receive extra therapy and counselling. Any SCP&#39;s stay at Site-169 is not to exceed three months, due to the limited resources available for long-term containment. 

More commonly, AEED procedures are performed off-site. Because the majority of sentient anomalies require specialised containment procedures, it is more cost-effective for AEED personnel to bring their equipment to the SCP&#39;s dedicated Site. As a result, the facilities at Site-169 are primarily used by personnel to troubleshoot the logistical problems of anomalous recreation.[[footnote]] For instance, how to simulate the feeling of playing basketball for a sentient inanimate object; or how to space the chairs in a movie theatre in order to accommodate a 16-m-tall humanoid.[[/footnote]] 

On-site personnel are permitted to use facilities for their own recreation, provided this does not interrupt standard AEED procedures. **Personnel are reminded that this policy is heavily enforced by Site Director Feghoot.**

If the AEED folks had their way, we&#39;d spend all day sitting around playing piccolo. That&#39;s why I run the Site and they don&#39;t. Regardless of your thoughts on an SCP&#39;s &#34;humanity&#34; - or lack thereof - the Foundation works because we have procedures. We don&#39;t just //have// rules: we //follow// them. So if you think you can request transfer to my site just to fool around all day, you&#39;ve got another thing coming. 
[[&gt;]]

**Anomalous Entity Engagement Division (AEED) Headquarters** - The main building of Site-169 is a two-story structure built amid the remains of an old military fort. Rather than demolishing the ruins, they have been built into in order to reinforce the Site&#39;s cover story as a Historical Preservation Site. The building primarily consists of offices, as well as an upstairs presentation room for official meetings and orientation. 

**Records Storage** - Beneath the Headquarters are a series of cold storage rooms for documents and non-anomalous objects. 

**Object Containment** - Due to the highly specialised nature of Site-169, as well as its relative smallness in comparison to other Sites, very few SCPs are actually stored here. Those that are are exclusively Safe-class anomalies that can be contained in standard, low-resource containment facilities. Testing is not performed at Site-169. 

**Recreational Facilities** - The underground facilities include: a basketball court (with collapsible nets/equipment for other games such as tennis, dodgeball, volleyball, etc.); a playhouse with a projector curtain for movie screening; a quiet reading area with a selection of approved books and comics; a pool with attached changing facilities; and a central &#34;common area&#34; for tabletop- and card games. 

**Mess Hall** - The cafeteria is available to both personnel and visiting anomalies with approved clearance. Due to resource constraints, accommodations for specialized diets may not be possible. 

**Housing and Commons** - Approximately half the wing is dedicated to personnel, while the rest of the rooms are rotated as temporary containment for visiting SCPs. All rooms are fitted with cameras and digital padlocks. When used for containment, the padlocks can be coded to only open from the outside. 

**Security and Surveillance** - Site-169&#39;s security team is responsible for upkeeping surveillance equipment throughout the site, monitoring cameras, and maintaining the secure site perimeter. They are also called upon to receive transfers from other sites and perform recovery in the event of a breach. 

**Vehicle Storage and Receiving** - As it is not uncommon for Site-169 to receive temporary transfers from other locations, the site&#39;s receiving department plays a crucial role in operations. A helipad is positioned at the top of the two-story carport, which is large enough to house armoured vehicles and semis. The ground floor of the building has a small receiving bay for shipments and supplies. 

**Playground** - Affectionately coined &#34;The Playground&#34; by site staff, this open-sided building contains a grass playing field with a running track, a small garden, and a modest collection of gym equipment. While more often used by personnel than anomalies, SCPs may be approved to use the Playground under close supervision. 

**Watch-Tower** - The elevated watchtower has an all-around view of the Site and the surrounding landscape. It is equipped with infrared cameras, floodlights, and a mounted tranquilliser rifle in the event of a security breach.

]]

**Site Director:** Dr. Moses Feghoot

**Deputy Site Director:** Dr. Kirby Case

**Director of AEED:** Dr. Amelie R. Metanoia

**On-Site Counselor:** Dr. Melissa Mayfield 

**On-Site Personnel:** 43

Being one of the smallest Sites currently maintained by the Foundation, Site-169 has a modest governing body. The Site Director is responsible for internal management and SOPs, while the Deputy Site Director oversees daily operations. The Director of AEED handles general management and operation of the Department. Together, these three individuals comprise Site-169&#39;s Board of Directors. 

Site-169 must have an on-site counsellor (currently Dr. Mayfield) due to the specialised work of the AEED. Unfortunately, due to personnel constraints, Dr. Mayfield is frequently forced to commute to other Sites to assist in AEED activities. Dr. Mayfield has made herself available for online counselling, specifically for Site-169 staff and anomalies.

++ Founding 
[[/=]]

In January and February of 1985, a series of anomalous incidents took place in the area surrounding what is now Site-169. This was brought to the Foundation&#39;s attention thanks to personnel living in the area. Anomalous incidents included: 

* Heliographs rotating to face Glassford Hill or other noteworthy locations 
* Heliographs flashing messages in morse code 
* Flashing lights seen in locations where there are no heliographs
* Distant sounds of fighting or singing with no discernible source 

See below for a detailed list of notable incidents. Foundation personnel were unable to replicate any of the above through testing. Dr. Amelie Metanoia, at the time a junior researcher assigned to the project, proposed that a site be constructed in order to monitor the area indefinitely. As part of her proposal, it was suggested that the site be used for recreation and counseling of sentient anomalies. Following O5 approval, this resulted in the creation of the Anomalous Entity Engagement Divison. Site-169 was officially opened on March 11, 1985.

++ Notable Incidents
[[/=]]

&gt; **9 January 1985**
&gt; 
&gt; Agent L. Seers, while hiking off-duty, reports seeing heliographs turning to face Glassford Hill on their own. Anomaly cannot be replicated through testing. 

&gt; **11 January 1985**
&gt; 
&gt; Agent Seers reports one heliograph flashing the same message in morse code. The message repeats three times before ceasing. Anomaly cannot be replicated through testing. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Recorded Message:** @@ ... --- / .- .-.. --- -. . .-.-.- / ... ..- -. / - .- .-.. -.- ..--.. @@
&gt; **Translation:** SO ALONE. SUN TALK? 

&gt; **14 February 1985**
&gt; 
&gt; While attempting to replicate the anomalies recorded by Agent Seers, a group of researchers report hearing sounds of furious fighting, &#34;as if right behind us.&#34; Description includes sounds of bows being fired, swords striking, the reports of bayonets, and screaming and sobbing. Anomaly ceased after approximately a minute. 

&gt; **10 March 1985**
&gt; 
&gt; Following the formation of Site-169, the majority of heliographs are moved to cold storage. One heliograph regularly used for testing suddenly crumbles to dust when a researcher attempts to pick it up. 

&gt; **11 March 1985** 
&gt; 
&gt; During Site-169&#39;s opening ceremony, the seven heliographs placed outside the site perimeter all flash the same message in morse code. Message is not repeated. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Recorded Message:** @@ ... - .- -.-- / .- .-- .... .. .-.. . .-.-.- / - --- ..- -.-. .... / --. .-. .- ... ... .-.-.- / ... ..- -. / - .- .-.. -.- .-.-.- @@
&gt; **Translation:** STAY AWHILE. TOUCH GRASS. SUN TALK. 

&gt; **13 May 2022**
&gt; 
&gt; Despite no recorded anomalies for almost 40 years, all seven heliographs suddenly turn to face Site-169. A message is flashed in morse code, repeating three times. No anomalous activity has been reported since. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Recorded Message:** @@ - .... .- -. -.- ... / ..-. --- .-. / - .- .-.. -.- .. -. --. .-.-.- / -.. --- -. - / .-.. . .- ...- . -.-.-- @@
&gt; **Translation:** THANKS FOR TALKING. DONT LEAVE!

A lot of people regard the AEED, and by extension Site-169, as something small and unimportant. This couldn&#39;t be farther from the truth. I&#39;ve collected these resources to help people better understand what it is that we do here. Don&#39;t hesitate to reach out. We&#39;re a small department, and we need all the help we can get.
