    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>This policy is enforced by staff, at staff discretion. Don&#39;t try to enforce this policy yourself. You can report violations in [http://www.scp-wiki.net/chat-guide #site17] or through a PM to an active moderator or administrator (listed on [[[Meet The Staff]]]).

**__Rules__**

You must follow these rules when critiquing an author&#39;s work. See [[[Site Rules]]] for more.

# **Critique the work, not the author.** Do not make personal attacks on the author. Stick to criticizing their writing.
 * As an example, you can tell the author, &#34;This needs work. The main idea&#39;s fine except for the X, but addenda are complete crap.&#34; Don&#39;t say, &#34;You&#39;re a terrible writer. Why did you post this?&#34;
 * Feel free to suggest that the author consult resources like our [[[Guide Hub | guides and essays]]], workshop their work (in [http://www.scp-wiki.net/sandbox the sandbox], [[[Chat Guide | the chat]]], or [[[forum:start | the forums]]]), [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page do more background research], or spend more time reading the site. But don&#39;t be a jerk about it.
# **Your posts must contain some kind of content.** Only saying &#34;Meh&#34; //does not count// as content, because it doesn&#39;t tell the author or other readers any information at all. An emoticon, an insulting macro, or &#34;lol&#34; is not content -- it&#39;s spam.
 * Don&#39;t tell an author &#34;The problems with this article should be obvious&#34;. If they were obvious to the author, they wouldn&#39;t have made them, and a post like that contains no content except obliquely insulting the author.

[[=]]
++ In short: **Be helpful, civil, and open-minded.**

**__Guidelines__**

//Guidelines on Giving Critique://

# **Criticism should be helpful in some way.** Good critique suggests what the author did wrong //and// how to improve, or what they&#39;ve done right that they should continue doing.
 * Try to give the author an idea of where to take their next draft, or what might make their current article better.
# **Be as harsh as you need to be.** Sugarcoating your criticism may give the author the impression that their draft is already great, even if it&#39;s not.
 * &#34;Harsh&#34; is not the same as &#34;mean&#34;, and &#34;mean&#34; is not the same as &#34;helpful&#34;. The SCP Wiki is a creative writing //community// -- we want to encourage each other to keep writing and to improve our writing skills. Being mean or rude in your critique only discourages the author from working to be better.
# **Forum critique should be relatively in-depth.** Forum threads are made for in-progress drafts. You should make sure your critique is in-depth enough for the author to make substantial changes to their article (if necessary).
 * This is because if you respond to a post on the forums, other people (including staff) may bump that article down their priority list when responding to drafts. So if your response is just &#34;I like it&#34;, then that author may //never// get in-depth critique from someone else!
 * Try to make sure you give enough criticism that an author can tell the quality of their entire draft.
# **Critique on posted articles can be short.** Articles posted to the wiki should be finished drafts, so comments posted on them do not need to be in depth -- as long as they contain some kind of content.
 * Examples: You can say &#34;I agree&#34; (in response to another writer), or post a short but meaningful joke (so long as it&#39;s not spam or content-free). If you&#39;re not sure if you&#39;re being too brief, then post something more in-depth.
 * You aren&#39;t required to comment at all. You also don&#39;t have to explain your vote on an article.
# **Don&#39;t dog-pile.** If an article already has several significant posts about its flaws, you don&#39;t need to jump in and say you also think it&#39;s terrible. Post if you have something new to say.
# **Keep an open mind.** Try to respect stylistic choices. Maybe you personally don&#39;t like humorous mainlist articles, unusual Object Classes, or author avatars, but there&#39;s no rule about what sorts of articles other authors can try. We want to encourage people being ambitious.
# Remember, **writing is subjective** and critique is always a reflection of subjective thoughts and opinions.
