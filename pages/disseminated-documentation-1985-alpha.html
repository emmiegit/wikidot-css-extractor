**Excursion 310-DJ4-9LK**
**Priming:** [[[SCP-765]]] (success)
**Trigger:** Standard lethal injection
**Equipment:** Standard
**Reality Description:** SCP-1985 initially arrived in the core of an active volcano and expired. Excursion was repeated.
Individuals associated with The Serpent&#39;s Hand had triggered an AK-class end of the world scenario utilizing SCP-765 in combination with an unknown effect-amplifier, after the alternate reality&#39;s Foundation had decided to expand its size by 1000% for unknown reasons. 90% of the world&#39;s population was afflicted with crippling lethargy, apathy, boredom, and depression, causing vast numbers to die of starvation, and sometimes dehydration, as they ceased to eat or drink respectively. SCP-1985 was unfortunately not immune to this effect, and died of starvation after several months.
**Logs:** [FORTHCOMING]
**Retrieval:** Uneventful. SCP-1985 expressed intense relief at being free of SCP-765&#39;s effect.
**Retrieved Items:** A canister of water from the modified SCP-765, collected before SCP-1985 succumbed to the effect.
**Notes:** This was intended to test to see if SCP-1985 would find a reality undergoing a K-Class scenario related to the safest of Safe-class SCPs. 

**Excursion 17V-MNU-094**
**Priming:** [[[SCP-573]]] (success)
**Trigger:** Standard lethal injection
**Equipment:** Standard
**Reality Description:** SCP-573 was stolen from the Foundation by members of the Chaos Insurgency, who used it to control several million animals and children in the continental United States, first using them to extract political concessions, then using them as a makeshift army, then eventually slaughtering most of them. No alteration to SCP-573 was apparently required to achieve this effect.
Notably, during this excursion, SCP-1985 encountered what appeared to be an alternate version of itself, also in excursion form with similar visual traits, and completely missing both arms. This alternate version of SCP-1985 fled on sight, and SCP-1985 was unable to relocate it. SCP-1985 was killed by the Chaos Insurgency after two weeks.
**Logs:** [FORTHCOMING]
**Retrieval:** Uneventful
**Retrieved Items:** None.
**Notes:** It is not known if this reality&#39;s version of SCP-573 possesses the same capabilities that its alternate demonstrated during this excursion.

**Excursion 051-UWJ-97Y**
**Priming:** [[[SCP-1157]]] (success)
**Trigger:** Standard lethal injection
**Equipment:** Standard
**Reality Description:** SK-class dominance shift scenario in which instances of SCP-1157 had become the dominant species of Earth. Baseline humans made up a significant minority, with the majority of their population having been killed. Instances of SCP-1157 controlled most major countries, though humans still controlled a minority. The Foundation was still present and containing the majority of extant SCP items, and many SCP-1157 instances were working with the Foundation and the remnants of the Global Occult Coalition to attempt to reverse the SK-class scenario. Additionally, not all SCP-1157 instances were identical to SCP-1157-1; sixteen different base forms were observed, each represented by a different collective consciousness. [DATA EXPUNGED]
**Logs:** [FORTHCOMING]
**Retrieval:** Uneventful.
**Retrieved Items:** [DATA EXPUNGED]
**Notes:** Remainder of excursion details, including nature of retrieved items, are currently classified Level 5.

**Excursion 1FR-L75-03X**
**Priming:** [[[SCP-1004]]]
**Trigger:** Standard lethal injection
**Equipment:** Standard
**Reality Description:** Mass broadcast and distribution of SCP-1004 by associates of The Factory resulted in an AK-class end of the world scenario in which 94% of the global population exhibited behavior characteristic of SCP-1004&#39;s final stages. The Foundation survived in this reality, and efforts to reverse SCP-1004&#39;s effects were ongoing, though resulting in only minor success. SCP-1985 was killed within one week of arrival.
**Logs:** [RESTRICTED]
**Retrieval:** Uneventful
**Retrieved Items:** None.
**Notes:** Request was made by Dr. Bright, to investigate the possible seriousness of SCP-1004&#39;s effects. 

**Excursion NIN-100-RC3**
**Priming:** None
**Trigger:** SCP-1985 was caught in crossfire during a Chaos Insurgency incursion during a move between sites, sustaining injuries to its left leg. SCP-1985 acquired a weapon and fatally shot itself.
**Equipment:** None except for inbuilt recording equipment
**Reality Description:** [EXPUNGED DATA PENDING RELEASE] SCP-1985 was publicly tortured and killed in a group execution. Members of group included four local versions of SCP-1985&#39;s family members.
**Logs:** [RESTRICTED]
**Retrieval:** Uneventful. 
**Retrieved Items:** [EXPUNGED DATA PENDING RELEASE]
**Notes:** As typical after an excursion of this nature, SCP-1985 requested temporary isolation and temporary cessation of experimentation. Request granted.

**Excursion D4L-41N-K0M**
**Priming:** Repeated exposure to [[[SCP-3932]]] (success)
**Trigger:** Standard lethal injection
**Equipment:** Standard
**Reality Description:** Following Foundation diplomatic intervention, tensions between SCP-3932-Δ nation-states became lessened. This resulted in a temporary peace accord between the nations, who then declared war on humanity. Conversion of all oceanic cetaceans into SCP-3932-Δ instances followed shortly thereafter, with full conversion occurring three months after.
The SCP-3932-Δ instances then caused a partial SK-Class Dominance Shift Scenario, resulting in all oceans being taken over by SCP-3932-Δ instances. The original three nation-states of SCP-3932-Δ emerged as major superpowers, but were unable to retain complete control over the world.
**Logs:** [FORTHCOMING]
**Retrieval:** SCP-1985 manifested in the water off the coast of Australia, having previously been aboard an Great Barrier Reef Empire-In-Exile prison vessel. Rescue dispatched from Site-72.
**Retrieved Items:** None.
**Notes:** In this reality, the Foundation has avoided any attempt to diminish the cold war between SCP-3932-Δ nation-states, out of fear of potential alliance.

**Excursion 5TY-H6I-GHR**
**Priming:** [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-682 SCP-682] and associated [http://www.scp-wiki.net/experiment-log-t-98816-oc108-682 Termination Log] (unknown)
**Trigger:** Standard lethal injection
**Equipment:** Standard, along with a [RESTRICTED LEVEL 5] stealth device
**Reality Description:** SCP-1985 arrived in a massive stone labyrinth consisting of hallways approximately 3.5 meters wide and 12 meters tall. The labyrinth appeared to be carved from a single seamless type of material, with no cracks observed during the entirety of SCP-1985&#39;s excursion. The lack of any observable light source required use of a Foundation-issue flashlight. SCP-1985&#39;s exploration of this reality remained uneventful until it encountered an object possessing cognitohazardous and/or unknown anomalous properties, resulting in the damage of SCP-1985&#39;s inbuilt recording and communication equipment. Remaining footage of the object was too blurry to decipher or remained cognitohazardous, but after-action report from SCP-1985 described the object as a stained-glass window, imbedded into one of the walls, with light shinning through it. SCP-1985 was unable to identify the image on the window, due to fear of mind-altering effects from prolonged exposure. SCP-1985 was able to resist the cognitohazard but claims it gave it the urge to [DATA EXPUNGED].
SCP-1985 describes encountering two other anomalous objects: a red organic cube protruding out of a wall, and a large presumably mechanical object SCP-1985 observed moving across a hallway in the distance. After three days, SCP-1985 came across a large square room, with the only features being an unknown object hanging 3 meters off the ground[[footnote]] Due to unknown cognitohazardous/[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-1184-ru ████████████] influence, SCP-1985 was unable to accurately determine the appearance of the object. SCP-1985 claimed it was either a chandelier of some type, or a board with an unknown linguistic character on it.[[/footnote]] and a large hole underneath it, emitting yellowish-green light and producing sawtooth beeps. SCP-1985 describes approaching the hole and looking down it, but is unable to remember what was down the hole and what happened afterwards; it is presumed this lead to its death as SCP-1985 manifested in baseline reality around this time.
**Logs:** [FORTHCOMING]
**Retrieval:** Uneventful
**Retrieved Items:** None.
**Notes:** This excursion was meant to be the first in a series of excursions with the goal of gaining knowledge of potential K-class scenarios caused by SCP-682 and to prepare countermeasures. Whether or not the observed reality has any relation to SCP-682 is currently under review.

**Excursion TLB-13P-MM9**
**Priming:** [[[SCP-2186]]] (success)
**Trigger:** Standard lethal injection
**Equipment/Personnel:** Standard
**Reality Description:** This reality&#39;s Foundation was at a point in time in which [[[SCP-148]]]&#39;s deleterious properties were still unknown and its usage was relatively common; this Foundation had additionally created an altered form of beryllium bronze by reverse engineering SCP-148 and [[[SCP-402]]]. This metal functioned similarly to SCP-148, absorbing reality altering properties instead of mind-effecting ones.

This metal was used during a surgery performed on SCP-2186, lining the surfaces of the room. Despite the application of general anesthesia, SCP-2186&#39;s properties activated in the middle of the procedure with a higher intensity than normal; stage 1 transformation occurring after 30 seconds followed by stage 2 occurring after 2 minutes. The altered metal prevented the anomaly&#39;s properties (which lasted 12 hours, preventing the object&#39;s retrieval before it expired) from extending beyond the room. Approximately 16 minutes after the object expired, the altered metal released the anomalous energy which resulted in the entirety of the Earth, everything therein, and the Moon to undergo stage 2 transformation. SCP-1985 returned to baseline reality after six months of exploring the transfigured landscape.
**Logs:** [FORTHCOMING]
**Retrieval:** Uneventful
**Retrieved Items:** Material samples taken from affected landscapes, objects, and organisms.
**Notes:** DNA analysis of 68% of retrieved samples are a direct match with SCP-2186. DNA analysis of 29% of retrieved samples have no exact genetic match to existing organisms. The results of the DNA analysis of the remaining 3% of retrieved samples is restricted, pending release.

**Excursion V08-FXB-N25**
**Priming:** SCP-1985&#39;s own, personal origins (failure)
**Trigger:** Standard lethal injection
**Equipment:** Standard
**Reality Description:** SCP-1985 initially arrived mid-Pacific Ocean and swam to shore. A full-scale [[[SCP-1801]]] outbreak had converted the majority of life on the planet into a single, contiguous, fleshy mass. When SCP-1985 arrived, SCP-1801 had apparently adapted in order to begin converting inorganic material as well, and was in the process of doing so. A small number of SCP Foundation personnel survived, and were attempting to contain the SCP-1801 outbreak, with little success. The SCP-1801 mass attempted to convert SCP-1985 after it accidentally came into close contact with the mass, and SCP-1985 was automatically returned as normal.
**Logs:** [FORTHCOMING]
**Retrieval:** Uneventful
**Retrieved Items:** None.
**Notes:** Accidental discovery of potential extra capabilities associated with SCP-1801 has been passed on as per standard procedure.

**Excursion XJU-034-IQ1**
**Priming:** SCP-1985&#39;s own, personal origins (success)
**Trigger:** Standard lethal injection
**Equipment:** Standard
**Reality Description:** [DATA EXPUNGED]
**Log:** [N/A]
**Retrieval:** [DATA EXPUNGED]
**Retrieved Items:** [N/A]
**Notes:** [DATA EXPUNGED] Personnel with Level 4 clearance may access the content of this entry, attached to main [[[SCP-1985]]] documentation [[[scp-1985|here]]] under the Update to Excursions section.
