**__The 049 + 035 Archive__**
Okay so back in April I really only knew the big iconic SCPs and I took a liking to 049 and 035 especially. So what else to do than keep drawing them when they were raking in the internet points?

[[image https://i.imgur.com/hrkRRCv.png]]
Here&#39;s the first image of Davy, and my first like, &#39;bone reconstruction&#39; thing i do sometimes. I basically didn&#39;t want to draw an actual fish skeleton so i looked up some references and made my own! That&#39;s how davy bones came to be. That&#39;s my process actually: the image comes first, and after some sketching THEN I start writing! Veeery slowly. Writing isn&#39;t my strong suit lol.

This is a comic I did right after I finished the draft. I really like the colours and how vague it is.

**__Theatre Troupe__**
[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/a-good-actor | The Theatre Troupe]]] is a group of characters who lived during the Renaissance. My pals Mel, Pepsi (&lt;3) and I have had this idea for awhile and I drew a lot of art and stuff for it, as well as an animatic.

[[tab About Me]]

[[image https://i.imgur.com/T0xBvjN.jpg]]

**[[size large]]Hello![[/size]]**
I&#39;m Tropia and I do the draws and the funnies. I got into SCP April 2019 and I drew a lot of art for it, and now I joined here so I was like hm. Tis a good idea.
----
I usually get inspiration for my art from the music I listen to and I do this really cool thing where if I don&#39;t have the song on loop and change to another one I&#39;ll leave the drawing unfinished and move on to another one. With SCP at first I wanted to be funny and hey it worked, some of the comics I did are sort of funny.

I use Procreate for all my digital stuff, and sometimes I go back and forth between the two. Sketching is definitely the most fun part of it all for me and you can tell, with the over-abundance of sketches and lack of actual finished pieces in here.
My go-to canvas is just the standard Instagram square, 1080x1080, but sometimes I like to stretch that sucker out if I know I want to make a bigger piece. 

My inspiration for my style comes from mainly cartoons (duh) and rubberhose cartoons (those old and vintage ones). I like drawing fluidly and quickly and I don&#39;t like to spend too much time on one piece, though at times the finished product is worth it.

I&#39;m looking forward to drawing more scps yeehoo!
