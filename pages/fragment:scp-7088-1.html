**Special Containment Procedures:** A sustainable population of SCP-7088 is to be kept within Sector 2 of [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-44#%23|Site-44]]] in an artificial cavernous environment. Instances are to be fed every 5-6 months and communicated with infrequently.

Wild populations of SCP-7088 are under the jurisdiction of the Cryptozoology Division, who are tasked with retrieval operations and researching the organisms within their natural surroundings. Cave systems inhabited by the genus are to be blocked from public access under the cover story of unstable topography or a cave-in. Due to SCP-7088’s isolated native habitat, further containment is unnecessary.

Further developments regarding the SCP-7088-IMPERATOR subspecies will be available at the base of this document. 

**Description:** SCP-7088 is a cave-dwelling anomalous genus of amphibian located within a portion of Northern Europe, primarily Great Britain. Members of SCP-7088 resemble extremely large //Cryptobranchus alleganiensis// [[footnote]] Giant Salamander [[/footnote]] while, in infancy, resembling //P. anguinus//; [[footnote]] Olm, or proteus; an aquatic salamander in the family Proteidae, the only exclusively cave-dwelling chordate species found in Europe  [[/footnote]] all instances possess vestigial wings in addition to leathery skin and a serpentine spinal structure. Skin pigments range from reddish-brown to earth-green depending on region and rock composition. SCP-7088’s brain-to-body ratio remains the highest of all known amphibians, allowing for drastically increased mental capacity capable of recognising basic human speech.

SCP-7088 specimens also possess a unique luminous organ protruding from their upper jaw, termed the //Ozz noetica// by Foundation cryptobiologists. The //Ozz noetica// is possessed only by members of the genus and is a characteristic trait of all known instances. Capable of sub-noospheric interference, the organ permits SCP-7088 to transfer speech to sentient observers if positioned correctly.

SCP-7088 rarely surface from inhabited caverns (usually housing a group of 5-10 instances), only exiting in search of prey. SCP-7088’s natural diet once consisted primarily of deer, rabbits and low-lying shrubbery though, since human inhabitation of the British Isles, has shifted heavily towards the consumption of livestock and crops. Although this poses some threat to secrecy, instances only require sustenance on average twice per year, during which time they will gorge upon all nourishment available before returning to their brood. A largely stationary lifestyle allows for long periods of time between consumption.

While SCP-7088 are believed to have once been apex predators in their environments, since the adoption of more readily available food sources, instances now demonstrate a more lethargic lifestyle.

**History:**
SCP-7088 was officially recognised by the Foundation in the late 1910s, though legends of the genus have persisted since the Middle Ages. SCP-7088 is commonly referred to as the “Knucker” in their inhabited territories, originating from an Old English term meaning “water monster”. At the time of the Middle Ages, SCP-7088 are believed to have dwelled mainly in wells or deep lakes, prompting human interactions and occasionally conflict. While it is unknown how long the genus has been present within Britain or Europe as a whole, fossilised specimens have been recorded originating from the late Cretaceous Era. SCP-7088’s common ancestors, if any, remain undiscovered.

Since the 18th Century and the onset of the industrial revolution, accounts of SCP-7088 reduced significantly, likely due to the sudden influx of hazardous waste produced by human development. This is theorised to have caused SCP-7088 to abandon their former freshwater habitats and adopt a largely subterranean lifestyle, lessening human-to-SCP-7088 encounters. Prior to the 21st Century, the only evidence available for the genus’ existence was ecological DNA imprints and the rare remains of deceased instances. In the early 2000s, a group of research staff successfully located and made contact with a group of live specimens (See Addendum).

**Addendum 7088.1:** Initial Incident
On 29/10/2008, an exchange between Troy █████, an American oil tycoon and multimillionaire, and an unknown buyer was revealed to the Foundation following an unrelated investigation into Mr █████‘s business activity. Following examination of the discussion and further insight into the genus’ behaviour, SCP-7088 involvement has been suspected.

**Addendum 7088.2:** Attempted Interviews
Following investigation and sonic imaging of cave systems surrounding the town of Mossmoor, Somerset, England in 2009, it was theorised that a colony of SCP-7088 was present in the surrounding area.

&gt; **&lt;END LOG&gt;**

Eventually, information regarding nearby “knuckerholes” was traded with SCP-7088-24 for the agreed upon price of two //Snickers// bars and a flashlight. According to information acquired during Interview 7088-2, an SCP-7088 colony is present in the area surrounding the primary transatlantic telecommunications cable. An investigation into a link between this development and the 2008 Exchange Incident is currently underway.

**Addendum 7088.3:** 25/07/2022 Update
Upon the discovery of a knuckerhole located in Lyminster, Sussex, England, a Foundation-operated high resolution ground-penetrating radar team was utilised in order to preemptively view the cave system. It is believed that all knuckerholes follow a generalised layout and, as such, the scan remains a reference for SCP-7088 dwellings’ features. The following observations were noted:

&gt; * Accessible only via a small, but deep, pond.
&gt; 
&gt; * Comprised of a primary cavern wherein most SCP-7088 reside, generally surrounded by small waterfalls leading into a central “lake”.
&gt; 
&gt; * Secondary cavern comprised of cultivated stalactites.
&gt; 
&gt; * Submerged cavern used for the cultivation of oviparous [[footnote]] Egg-born [[/footnote]] young.
&gt; 
&gt; * A large underwater passageway off-shooting from the primary cavern’s body of water that leads to a hidden chamber.
&gt; 
&gt; * An extremely large, submerged, chamber or “keep” filled with copious amounts of rare materials, coins and gemstones. In all documented cases, highly detailed recordings of this chamber display a colossal, scaled instance of SCP-7088 with exaggerated wings and limbs — large stalagmites on its parietal bone resemble spiring decorative horns. The instance remains dormant, seemingly in slumber.

Attempts are being made to extract and study a member of the //Proteus draconis imperator// subspecies in order to assess their dormancy patterns. It is believed that, in time, connections to folkloric tales regarding dragon-like megafauna may be made in addition to predicting future active periods.
