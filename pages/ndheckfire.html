Hello, %%title%%! Have we met before?
[[include :topia:listusers-2]]
Hello, esteemed authors and readers alike!
[[include :topia:listusers-3]]

If it wasn&#39;t obvious, I am [[*user ndheckfire]] and I am a writer for the SCP Wiki!

I&#39;ve been a fan of SCP Foundationverse for a long time now, and it&#39;s so happy to finally be a part of its wonderful community! I&#39;m a regular on the IRC (especially in #thecritters), so you&#39;ll probably see me around.

Welcome to my official authorpage![[footnote]]I have this now! Yay![[/footnote]] I made this just so I can keep tabs on the stuff I created simultaneously, and without me having to check every single one individually. I&#39;m not trying to do anything fancy here but I hope you enjoy it nonetheless!
