&#34;Yes, and?&#34;

Agent Carter sat in stunned silence. &#34;And?! What?&#34;

Agent Henderson was slightly confused. &#34;What?&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m not getting this.&#34;

Agent Carter compulsively pulled his hair back. &#34;Everything about it is wrong!&#34;

Agent Henderson stood up from the computer monitor. &#34;Well okay, it&#39;s not strictly by the book, but what do you suggest?&#34;

Carter paused, almost as if for effect. &#34;It&#39;s twenty-fourty-six.&#34;

Henderson paused. &#34;What?&#34;

&#34;I mean, [[[scp-2446| twenty-four-fourty-six]]]. It&#39;s the corpse thing! The reality bender!&#34;

Henderson put his fingers to his lips, processing this information. &#34;We don&#39;t know that it&#39;s a reality bender.&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s so obviously a reality bender!&#34;

Henderson raised a finger. &#34;There is nothing connecting these two cases, except the location.&#34;

&#34;Oh, no yeah, totally. Something spontaneously appears in San Jose, without warning or alert, //inside of the ground//. It&#39;s connected.&#34;

&#34;Underneath San Jose.&#34;

&#34;Underneath San Jose, yes.&#34;

&#34;Also, based on the description, it was hollow. 2446 manifests inside matter without moving it. They&#39;re completely different appearances.&#34;

&#34;He could have moved all the dirt and //then// transported the sphere.&#34;

&#34;So you&#39;re suggesting the &#39;reality bender&#39; we don&#39;t know exists did this for... Why?&#34;

Carter was silent. &#34;I don&#39;t know, but it could be anything, and that statue and that house definitely have to do with why.&#34;

&#34;It kind of has to.&#34;

&#34;It has to!&#34;

&#34;Look,&#34; Henderson put a hand on Carter&#39;s shoulder. &#34;I very much appreciate you looking into potentially connected anomalies, but you&#39;re going to go mad looking for connections that aren&#39;t there. What does the format of the document even have to do with this? Do you think the reality bender took over central?&#34;

&#34;Halfway through they stop ending with punctuation. I&#39;ve submitted elaboration requests on these docs, but they&#39;ve been rejected. We still don&#39;t even know what twenty-four-fourty-six is!&#34;

&#34;We know what it is.&#34;

&#34;No, we don&#39;t. We don&#39;t know what the bodies are, but the containment procedures have something to do with us!&#34;

&#34;Is it a conspiracy?&#34;

Carter was taken aback. &#34;I mean... It has to be. There has to be more here, more that we aren&#39;t privy to. We haven&#39;t been told anything.&#34;

&#34;We&#39;re being told what we need to know. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be briefed on 2446 when we need to be. I&#39;ll put in my own request on this doc, but for the time being, just don&#39;t worry about it.&#34;

Carter sighed. &#34;Okay. I&#39;ll try to put it out of my mind.&#34;

&#34;Thank you. Now, go work.&#34;

Carter stepped out of his superior&#39;s office. He looked back before leaving around a corner in the hall.

Henderson was disappointed in himself. Sitting behind him was the topic of his previous conversation. &#34;That&#39;s very upstanding of you, agent. Sparing his feelings.&#34;

&#34;Please... Don&#39;t talk to me, now.&#34;

&#34;Tut tut tut, how very unladylike.&#34;

Henderson closed his eyes. Every time they talked, he felt ashamed. &#34;What did you have to do with that record?&#34;

&#34;Doesn&#39;t matter.&#34;

Henderson gritted his teeth. &#34;It kind of does matter.&#34;

&#34;Don&#39;t worry about it. I just... Gave a little hand, in the record keeping.&#34;

&#34;Why are you here now?&#34;

&#34;What? I can&#39;t stop by one of my very best friends?&#34;

Henderson wanted to bite someone&#39;s nose off. &#34;Who was it that said we don&#39;t negotiate with terrorists?&#34;

&#34;You always say that.&#34;

Henderson turned around. &#34;I&#39;ve never said that before.&#34;

Charles Hull leaned forward and smiled. &#34;You always say that.&#34;

Then he was gone. Henderson sat down and tried to forget.
