**Item #:** SCP-3727

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3727 is to be kept in a standard humanoid holding cell at Site-17. No syringes or objects resembling syringes are to be brought within the line of sight of SCP-3727 unless authorized by research personnel. The walls of SCP-3727’s cell are to be regularly checked for perforations. In the event that SCP-3727’s cell has sustained damage, SCP-3727 is to be moved to a temporary containment unit until repairs are complete.

**Description:** SCP-3727 is a 52 year old caucasian male with the ability to remotely manipulate syringes, as well as any objects that resemble a syringe in shape. The exact specifications of what qualifies as “syringe-shaped” have not been fully defined, but the presence of a pointed tip, a broader section resembling the barrel of a syringe, and a segment resembling the plunger are necessary. An object does not have to function as a syringe in order to fall under the effects of SCP-3727. The strength of SCP-3727’s remote manipulation is unclear, with SCP-3727 being able to move syringe shaped objects of several metric tons in weight and move them at speeds of up to 375 m/s (as of ██/██/20██) with no signs of exhaustion. These effects extend to any syringe shaped object within approximately 50 meters and within line of sight of SCP-3727. 

Upon initial questioning, SCP-3727 claimed to be a doctor from ██████, Tennessee. Analysis of SCP-3727’s birth certificate and SSN have confirmed this statement. SCP-3727 also claimed to have no recollection regarding the nature and origin of its anomalous properties, stating that they were first noticed about two months before Foundation acquisition. --SCP-3727 has been largely compliant during Foundation custody, and has usually refrained from using its anomalous properties unless instructed.--



**Addendum 3727-1:** //Testing Logs//

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Access Testing Logs&#34; hide=&#34;- Close Testing Logs&#34;]]

&gt; **Experiment 3727-A:**
&gt; **Object:** Medical grade hypodermic syringe
&gt; **Instructions:** Move object 2 meters.
&gt; **Results:** Successful manipulation.
&gt; **Conclusion:** SCP-3277 can manipulate syringes.

&gt; **Experiment 3727-B:**
&gt; **Object:** Standard 100-gauge insulin syringe
&gt; **Instructions:** Perform an insulin injection on D-7623, a Type 1 Diabetic
&gt; **Results:** Injection successfully completed. No adverse effects reported by D-7623.
&gt; **Conclusion:** SCP-3727 is capable of finely maneuvering desired syringes.

&gt; **Experiment 3727-C:**
&gt; **Object:** Plastic mold of a hypodermic syringe
&gt; **Instructions:** Move object 2 meters.
&gt; **Results:** Successful manipulation.
&gt; **Conclusion:** SCP-3727 is capable of moving objects that resemble syringes, even when said object are not syringes.

&gt; **Experiment 3727-D:**
&gt; **Object:** Standard 100-gauge insulin syringe. Needle is bent by 85°.
&gt; **Instructions:** Realign needle
&gt; **Results:** SCP-3727 was unable to manipulate the syringe in any capacity.
&gt; **Conclusion:** SCP-3727 is incapable of moving objects that are not shaped like proper syringes, even when said objects are syringes.

&gt; **Experiment 3727-E:**
&gt; **Object:** Photograph of a hypodermic syringe
&gt; **Instructions:** Move object 2 meters.
&gt; **Results:** SCP-3727 was unable to manipulate the photograph in any capacity.
&gt; **Conclusion:** Objects must bear more than a visual resemblance to a syringe, and must be three dimensional.

&gt; **Experiment 3727-F:**
&gt; **Object:** Asian Tiger Mosquito (//Aedes albopictus//)
&gt; **Instructions:** Move object 2 meters. 
&gt; **Results:** SCP-3727 was unable to manipulate the organism in any capacity.
&gt; **Conclusion:** Objects must bear a structural resemblance to a typical syringe, even if said objects are capable of syringe-like functions.

&gt; **Experiment 3727-G:**
&gt; **Object:** Concrete cast in the shape of a syringe with a mass of 25 metric tons.
&gt; **Instructions:** Move object 2 meters.
&gt; **Results:** Manipulation successful.
&gt; **Conclusion:** SCP-3727 can manipulate objects many times larger than typical syringes.

&gt; **Experiment 3727-H:**
&gt; **Object:** Concrete cast in the shape of a syringe with a mass of 25 metric tons.
&gt; **Instructions:** Accelerate object to 30 m/s.
&gt; **Results:** Manipulation successful. Object attains speed of 30 m/s in 2 seconds.
&gt; **Conclusion:** SCP-3727 can exert forces of at least 375 KNs on desired syringe-shaped objects.

&gt; **Experiment 3727-I:**
&gt; **Object:** Carbon molecular construct resembling a syringe.
&gt; **Instructions:** Move object across length of petri dish.
&gt; **Results:** Manipulation successful.
&gt; **Conclusion:** SCP-3727 can manipulate objects many times smaller than a typical syringe.

&gt; **Experiment 3727-J:**
&gt; **Object:** [http://scp-wiki.net/scp-991 SCP-991]
&gt; **Instructions:** Utilize SCP-991
&gt; **Results:** Subject extracts SCP-991-2 from D-3093. However, when attempting to inject substance into another D-class personnel, SCP-991-2 spontaneously disappears. Subject reports hearing “This is fucking weird. When is lunch?” in his head. Furthermore, Subject reports having a memory of being involved in a test with SCP-████, despite said SCP being located at Site-██. Records confirm that D-3093 was involved with a test with the aforementioned SCP 3 days prior to experiment 3727-J.
&gt; **Conclusion:** Cross testing between SCP-3727 and other anomalous objects can have unpredictable effects. Further cross testing requires approval of two Level 3 personnel or one Level 4 personnel.

**Addendum 3727-2:** //Incident Report: ██/██/20██//

As of ██/██/20██, SCP-3727 has demonstrated a broadening in its ability to control syringe shaped objects. Along with the ability to remotely manipulate objects shaped to resemble syringes, SCP-3727 has also acquired the ability to extract syringe-shaped molds from larger substances. This behavior was first recorded when SCP-3727 remotely extracted a mass of water in the approximate shape of a syringe from its daily water supply. Upon questioning, SCP-3727 claimed that it could &#34;feel&#34; the syringe shape inside the water, and that this was not a previously known ability.

12 days later, SCP-3727 was observed extracting syringe-shaped casts in a similar manner from the steel walls of its holding cell. This was originally classified as an attempted containment breach, and was met with immediate intervention from security personnel. Upon questioning, SCP-3727 claimed to be exhibiting this behavior out of boredom and not a desire to escape. Proposals to provide SCP-3727 with sources of recreational stimulation are currently pending approval.
