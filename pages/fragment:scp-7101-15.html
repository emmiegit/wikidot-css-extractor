= **//OPERATION: BLACKCAT//**
Efforts are being made to minimize the number of scenarios wherein an outcome may be decided partially or entirely based on probability. This includes gambling of any kind, draws, sports events, casinos, and warfare.

A worldwide stipulation is to be made, instructing elderly civilians over the age of 65 to maintain a secondary individual nearby, in case of emergency.

Public events with an area smaller than 300^^2^^M may have a maximum occupancy of no higher than 70 individuals. Events with differing units are to work off of this metric.

There is to be a maximum occupancy of 35 passengers aboard any and all aerocrafts, and 80 aboard sea-faring vessels. Additionally, no aircraft may carry cargo exceeding 200KG and ships 820KG. At this time, space ventures are not to be attempted.

Bi-annual inspections are to take place within all institutions, systems, structures, and equipment. The number of inspections per year may increase based on the importance of properly functioning technology in the given time.

Increased financial and other forms of support are to be put into researching, developing, and perfecting healthcare and prevention sciences and institutions. Efforts are to be made to mass-produce copies of [[[SCP-500|SCP-500]]], which are then to be dispensed to the public should developments of harmful illnesses or mental handicaps reach unacceptable levels. This point in time, should it occur, will be decided by the Ethics Committee along with the current Project Lead.

Efforts are to be made to implement these protocols within the public without arousing suspicion, which will require extensive fabrication of various purposes, which, according to analysis, may set humanity&#39;s progress back to around 2022, and will delay further progression by around 91%.

+++ **DESCRIPTION:**
------

SCP-7000 is a phenomenon occurring in instances of available pockets of probability that causes affected subjects to experience additionally hostile, unfortunate, or otherwise unfavorable circumstances. The exact mechanics of how this process occurs is unknown.

Since its discovery, there has been a major rise in diagnoses of various life-threatening illnesses, as well as accidents of any nature occurring, newborn children found to have various handicaps, malfunctions within architecture, electronics, and other systems, and the global death-toll.

Typical instances of SCP-7000 may be observed as:
* An individual being located in an environment that, at the current time, is more hazardous than it is regularly;
* A higher concentration of subjects experiencing a hazardous scenario that usually results in injury, damage, or termination;
* Hazardous events, such as fires, earthquakes, gas leaks, etc, occurring near individuals with disabling handicaps;
* Development of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tidal waves, hurricanes, tornados, droughts, or floods;
* Personnel that are usually well trained and or equipped make increased numbers of mistakes.

Recorded instances of this include:

* The individual known as O5-04 had entered an alleyway, only to get killed due to a botched robbery.
* A pipe within Site-17 burst within Server Room-04, resulting in mass flooding of the room, 3 other server rooms, and the loss of 04.082% of Foundation records, including all files previously associated with SCP-7000.
* A 6.4 scale earthquake occurred within Reliquary Site-27, which heavily damaged several sections of the facility, including the cafeteria, dormitories, and infirmary. 19 personnel were killed during this, including Director Kaleb Tennanbaum, head of the Department of Applied Theology, who was being treated there for a previous injury caused believed to be an effect of SCP-7000.
* The complete annihilation of the newly reformed [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nx-03 State of Hy-Brasil], caused by earthquakes, fires, poor weather conditions, and ill-appropriate trade options.
* See incident report: 7/004.
* The failed termination of SCP-7000, resulted in the deaths of Director Pendant Roufhous, the previous head of the SCP-7000 project, and an unknown number of individuals. //[SEE INCIDENT REPORT:7/074]//

SCP-7000-1 is a humanoid, possibly female entity. Details about it or its relation to SCP-7000 are unknown.

SCP-7000-A is a specially modified ABSRDeI device. It was purported as being able to locate SCP-7000, though how this was achieved is unknown.

**Incident Report: 7/074--15/11/2039F:**
------
Footage recovered from a camera attached to a tree in a forest outside Area-55.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
= **[BEGIN LOG]**

= //Camera begins recording. In front of it is Director Roufhous. Their hand is removed from the camera, revealing them to be in a forested area, with a device appearing to be a modified ABSRDeI. Various runes are depicted upon the ground, circling the device//

**Dir. Roufhous:** We&#39;re rolling. Alright, well, good day, person. I&#39;m Director Pendant Roufhous, overseeing this termination attempt on SCP-7000. I have not told anyone about this; but if nothing really happens, well I&#39;ll just destroy this footage and move on.

= //Director Roufhous moves out of screen, before returning with a document//

**Dir. Roufhous:** So, I started thinking about Fortuna or Tyche, and thought about their relation to 7000. They were their respective culture&#39;s personification of Luck, and we were able to locate, identify, and terminate, or contain both of them. So why not 7000?

**Dir. Roufhous:** I&#39;ve been having Researchers Pepper and Fallen have another look at how we were able to trace Fortuna and found that her actions would leave something behind. Sorta like 7000?

= //Director Roufhous begins interacting with the device//

**Dir. Roufhous:** So,  technobabble aside (Pauses), I found a way to locate SCP-7000.

= //Director Roufhous begins removing several objects from their coat, before arranging them in a pattern around the device//

**Dir. Roufhous:** This might be a little bit much, but I haven&#39;t really tried this before, so let&#39;s hope for the best! Or, good luck, I suppose.

= //Director Roufhous removes a phone from their coat pocket, before calling, what is believed to be, Director Kaleb Tennanbaum. They begin chatting, though the conversation takes place outside of microphone reach. After hanging up, they approach the machine and activate it. They take a step back as it begins making several sounds, before turning to the attached screen//

**Dir. Roufhous:** I think... it&#39;s uh, working. (Talks toward the machine, not loud enough to be picked up by the recording device.)

= //The noises emitted from the machine begin slowing and quieting down. Director Roufhous looks at the screen, before looking at two different documents. They turn and approach the camera//

**Dir. Roufhous:** Didn&#39;t work.

= //Director Roufhous tries to turn the camera off, before hearing a noise from the device. They return to it//

**Dir. Roufhous:** The fuck?

= //Director Roufhous looks to the camera//

**Dir. Roufhous:** Oh. Uh, before it gave me the coordinates to Tyche, but now they&#39;re giving me the coords to (Pauses), the Atlantic sea, Australia, and Germany?

= //The device repeats the previous noise//

**Dir. Roufhous:** New coordinates. (Pauses) To Texas... Croatia... Sweden... and Pakistan?

= //The machine begins rapidly repeating the previous noises//

**Dir. Roufhous:** Ohh, what the hell?

= //The machine stops, displaying the coordinates listed below//

**Dir. Roufhous:** ██████████, 8 - L ██████, ████████[[footnote]] The exact coordinates of Area-55. Censored for security purposes.[[/footnote]]?

= //The machine makes another noise. Director Roufhous begins looking at the new coordinates and inputting them into their phone//

**Dir. Roufhous:** That&#39;s... right here.

= //Director Roufhous looks up from their phone, observing [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp7000contesthub SCP-7000-1] 2 meters away. It&#39;s face is partially obscurred by a sheet//

**Dir. Roufhous:** Err, hello?

= //SCP-7000-1 is stationary and unresponsive//

**Dir. Roufhous:** Hello?

= //SCP-7000-1 stares directly at Director Roufhous, unmoving//

**Dir. Roufhous:** Mate, you can&#39;t be here. This is government property; I&#39;m going to have to ask you to leave.

= //SCP-7000-1 remains motionless//

**Dir. Roufhous:** This is your last warning. Leave, now.

= //SCP-7000-1 does not respond. Director Roufhous begins approaching it, before SCP-7000-A makes another noise behind them. They turn to view the panel, as a second set of coordinates, exactly identical to the previously noted coordinates, appear on the screen//

= //Director Roufhous then turns back to SCP-7000-1, now seeing two instances where there once was one//

**Dir. Roufhous:** What the fuck?

= //SCP-7000-A sounds off twice more before Director Roufhous can turn to view it. They turn back to 4 SCP-7000-1 instances.//

**Dir. Roufhous:** Do you mind not fucking duplicating?

**SCP-7000-1-1:** Carlos Santiago.

**Dir. Roufhous:** What?

= //The instance becomes silent once more. The device beeps//

**Dir. Roufhous:** I&#39;m not looking at it.

= //The machine beeps again. Director Roufhous pulls their phone out, requesting assistance from Area-55 staff. Just before they can say where they are, the phone dies, just as SCP-7000-A sends out another alert//  

= //A rabbit is seen moving in the background. SCP-7000-A beeps again. A branch from a tree above the rabbit breaks and falls upon it, presumably killing it. Director Roufhous turns in reaction, before looking back at 8 SCP-7000-1 instances//

**Dir. Roufhous:** That&#39;s a tad bit alarming.

**SCP-7000-1-6:** Kurt Alexander.

= //SCP-7000-A alerts//

**Dir. Roufhous:** Is that your name? And what about your buddies, here? Have they all got names?

**SCP-7000-1-4:** Peter Davidson.

= //SCP-7000-A alerts//

**Dir. Roufhous:** And I&#39;m Pendant Roufhous, now shoo.

**SCP-7000-1-8:** Alesha Gray.

**SCP-7000-1-3:** Samantha Luis.

= //SCP-7000-A alerts twice//

**Dir. Roufhous:** What is going on here?

**SCP-7000-1-2:** Angus O&#39;Brien.

**Dir. Roufhous:** Alright.

= //Director Roufhous removes a revolver from their sleeve//

**Dir. Roufhous:** All of you are coming with me.

**SCP-7000-1-5:** Charles Vemhoff.

**SCP-7000-1-8:** Christian Kennedy.

**SCP-7000-1-2:** Hugo Sanchez.

= //SCP-7000-A alerts after every comment made by SCP-7000-1 instances//

**Dir. Roufhous:** I&#39;m warning you - stop this, now!

= //SCP-7000-1 instances continue citing different names. During this, an increase in local emergency service calls is noticed//

= //Director Roufhous begins backing away from the instances, walking out of camera range, before suddenly re-entering sight, visibly turned away from the original instances//

= //SCP-7000-A begins alerting rapidly//

= //Director Roufhous begins firing at the SCP-7000-1 instances, which are now in unknown numbers. A bullet pierces through the cloth covering one&#39;s face. It reels back momentarily, before returning to its original posture. The veil covering its face is lifted, and behind it appears to be a human face of unknown ethnicity, estimated to be ~20 years of age, and possessing holes where its eyes would be//

= //All SCP-7000-1 instances begin citing various names at once. SCP-7000-A alerts rapidly//

**Dir. Roufhous:** Fuck this.

= //Director Roufhous retrieves an automatic assault rifle from their coat, before leveling it. Post recovery, the rifle appeared to have been removed from Area-55&#39;s armory prior to this attempt//

**Dir. Roufhous:** Last chance!

= //The crowd of SCP-7000-1 momentarily stop//

**SCP-7000-1-/:** Kaleb Tennanbaum[[footnote]]After this, Director Tennanbaum was found to have fallen down a set of stairs, resulting in his hospitalization within Reliquary Area-27.[[/footnote]].

= //The crowd then continue chanting names, noticeably faster than prior//

= //Director Roufhous begins firing upon the crowd, with each affected instance momentarily staggering before retaining composure. All dialogue during this time is drowned out by the gunfire//

= //Gunfire continues for 8 seconds, ending when Director Roufhous runs out of ammunition. At this time, both SCP-7000-1 and SCP-7000-A are silent//

**SCP-7000-1-/:** Pendant Roufhous.

= //A meteor is seen falling from the top-left of the camera&#39;s perspective, which lands on Director Roufhous, killing them//

= //The instances demanifest. SCP-7000-A ceases all activity//
