//A flash of light.//
//You and your brother stare at the lamp between your beds, its glow fluctuating in intensity as he moves his hands back and forth. He looks focused, you look amazed.//
//Suddenly, the lightbulb bursts with a loud POP.//

//Another memory, in the garden.//
//You are both in middle school now, and the teachers want you to start thinking about your future.//
//You think it&#39;s way too soon, the world is so huge and there are so many possibilities you don&#39;t even know of yet.//
//Your brother though, knows exactly where he&#39;s going.//
//&#34;Paris&#34; he says. &#34;I wanna go to Paris.&#34; You joke that it&#39;s the city of lights and that he&#39;d be right at home, he laughs.//
//He tells you about the Louvre, and all the art there. He shows you a drawing he made and claims that one day it will hang on the walls of that museum. You stare at the trees in his drawings. They&#39;re beautiful.//
//You notice a van parked across the street from your home. You see it&#39;s from a company called Spare Components and Parts. You don&#39;t pay it any mind.//

//Another memory, a face.//
//And a name, being called out. &#34;RON!&#34; you hear.//
//&#34;RON! WAKE UP! YOU&#39;RE DROOLING ON MY COUCH!&#34;//
And then a slap.

&#34;Wait,&#34; thought Ron Gambi, age 34 &#34;that&#39;s not a memory, I am being slapped right now.&#34;

He said something that sounded like &#34;Mguh&#34;, blinked, and found himself staring at Alyx who —based on their raised hand— appeared ready to slap him again.

&#34;Oh good, you&#39;re back.&#34;

&#34;Yeah I— how long was I out?&#34; His head hurt, which he was pretty sure was a side effect of taking medecine that messed with his brain. His cheek hurt, too.

&#34;Couple of minutes. I noticed something was weird when your character stopped moving.  I paused the game and tried to get you to snap out of it but you were really far gone. Are your flashbacks always like that?&#34;

&#34;No, they mostly come when I&#39;m sleeping or not really thinking about anything. But this one... this one was really vivid. They said the effects should only be mild, and I always take just the prescribed dose, I&#39;m not sure what caused it.&#34;

&#34;I might.&#34; Alyx gestured towards the two empty plates laying on the table between the couch and the humming TV screen. &#34;Traditional omelette with mushrooms, using my mom&#39;s recipe and the mushrooms she grows at home and sends me. I know we use this kind for some of our rituals, but I didn&#39;t think it would react with your mnestics, my bad.&#34;

&#34;Don&#39;t apologise. Your mom&#39;s cooking just helped me find my brother.&#34;

//**Operation Gambi&#39;s Gambit**//
[[/=]]

**Date**: 05/09/2023
**Location**: Paris
**Personel Involved**: Ron Gambi, Laura Moshwinter[[footnote]]Mage of the 5th circle of Air and vice-head of Active Operations[[/footnote]], Agent Duvarier.

**Foreword**: Marcel Gambi was previously a contained SCP object, due to his ontokinetic ability to amplify or dampen various forms of energy he could percieve[[footnote]] Due to his vague ideas about what consisted a type of energy, this ability could affect electricity, heat and —following Foundation testing— EVE and Akiva radiation.[[/footnote]]. Following the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6500 Foundation&#39;s dissolution to form Vanguard], Marcel Gambi was abducted by rogue Foundation elements who rejected Vanguard&#39;s new mission, presumably because of his usefulness in powering a Site[[footnote]] Many other beneficial anomalies were stolen in this manner.[[/footnote]].

On the 17^^th^^ of March, 2023, Marcel Gambi was observed sneaking inside the London City Airport and is believed to have boarded one of the flights departing that day, likely fleeing from his captors. He has since remained undetected.

Making contact with Marcel Gambi has been declared a high priority, as he would be able to provide crucial inteligence on the location of these rogue Foundation elements. For this purpose, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/facing-forward Marcel Gambi&#39;s brother and Vanguard PR employee Ron Gambi] was given doses of diluted mnestics in order to bring back relevant memories.

In August 2023, he provided vice-head Moshwinter with a lead.

------
//The footage from Gambi&#39;s bodycam stabilizes as he emerges from the Way on the Champ de Mars. He is unsteady and leans on a large iron beam to balance himself. After catching his breath for a few seconds, he gazes up at the massive structure, then turns to Moshwinter who had arrived before him.//

**R.Gambi:** When you said we were taking a shortcut to Paris, I didn&#39;t realise you meant we&#39;d arrive straight under the Tower.

**Moshwinter:** It is a perk of working with the Maxwellists. Eiffel was a Mekhanite, one of the early believers in the concept of WAN. He built that tower in hope of making it a beacon that would draw in and reassemble the fragmented mind of WAN. He failed of course, but it does make a very effective anchor point for Ways.

**R.Gambi:** Huh. Wait, what about the Statue of Liberty then? Didn&#39;t he work on that too?

**Moshwinter:** You can look that up on your own. Come, our contact from the local branch is waiting for us.

//The pair walks through the streets of Paris. On their way, Moshwinter reprimands a street vendor for selling counterfeit grimoires, and Gambi pays a tip to a Yeren performing as a street mime.//

//As they walk through a crowded street, a storefront explodes. Three figures carrying bags jump out and begin running away, covering their escape by throwing tear gas canisters into the crowd, which appear to anomalously home towards people&#39;s faces. Before they can get out of view however, a squad wearing police uniforms blocks their way and restrains them using net launchers. They are then handcuffed, searched, and taken away.//

//Gambi and Moshwinter stay to help civilians who were harmed during the event, before leaving when more first responders arrive on the scene. They eventually arrive at their destination: a café in the 1st arrondissement, where a woman is waving at them.//

**Moshwinter:** Are you agent Duvarier?

**Duvarier:** I am. And you, are late.

**Moshwinter:** Apologies. We experienced some unplanned delays.

**Duvarier:** Traffic? Wouldn&#39;t be unusual around here.

**R.Gambi:** No, more like a violent robbery.

**Duvarier:** Ah, makes sense. This city&#39;s been a real shitshow lately, not that it wasn&#39;t one before.

**R.Gambi:** How come? I thought the government here was really active in making reforms to transition into the unveiled world?

**Duvarier:** Yeah, and that came with firing most of the gendastres[[footnote]]The anomalous branch of the Gendarmerie, France&#39;s military force tasked with law enforcement.[[/footnote]] so now they&#39;re taking their frustration out on civilians. Same as ever, except with a bit less responsibility and accountability. Then you&#39;ve got [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/saphir-centre SAPPHIRE] getting riled up after the Impasse, claiming that Vanguard stopped the world from correcting itself so now it&#39;s up to them to make sure it happens. Plus some other groups trying to profit from it all... Even with Vanguard&#39;s help, the government is barely preventing the capital from turning into a warzone.

//She pauses.//

**Duvarier:** Which brings us to your brother, actually.

**R.Gambi:** It does?

**Duvarier:** Yes. You said he&#39;s been doing his best to avoid detection?

**Moshwinter:** Correct. He was caught once by security cameras, then never again.

**Duvarier:** Well, with all that stuff going on, Paris is under heavy surveillance. If he&#39;s here and he hasn&#39;t been spotted, then there&#39;s only one place he can be hiding in. The one place we aren&#39;t looking.

//Gambi rubs his hands together.//

**R.Gambi:** Oh please say what I think you&#39;re going to say.

**Duvarier:** The catacombs.

//Gambi chuckles.//

[**Two hours of extraneous footage redacted**]

//The team is now in the sewers, standing in front of a hatch that Duvarier is struggling to open.//

**Moshwinter:** You know, Mr Gambi, I am surprised that you are looking forward to entering this place.

**R.Gambi:** You mean besides the opportunity to reunite with my long lost brother?

**Moshwinter:** Besides that, yes.

**R.Gambi:** Come on those are the Paris catacombs! Do you know how many urban legends there are about this place? I don&#39;t! Because there&#39;s so many.

**Duvarier:** MOVE YOU SON OF A—

//She grunts, then finally manages to force the hatch open. A ladder extends down from it, into the dark. The team turns on their headlights before climbing down. Gambi also checks his pockets and takes out, his phone, two flashlights, three spare batteries, a stack of folded up papers, a bag of bacon bites and a bottle of water; before placing them back in their respective pockets.//

**R.Gambi:** Good. All geared up.

//He climbs down and joins the other two.//

**R.Gambi:** So, what&#39;s our plan for this?

**Duvarier:** Okay so first, we&#39;re gonna split up to cover more ground faster, then—

**Moshwinter:** Absolutely not. There will be no splitting up.

**Duvarier:** Ah relax, I&#39;m kidding. Truth is, from what you&#39;ve told me I already have an idea of where to look. There&#39;s an area that&#39;s between the Louvre — which your brother used to be fascinated with — and a big crossroads of power lines, in case he wants to use his powers. It&#39;s pretty big though, we might not cover it in one day.

**R.Gambi:** And if he&#39;s not there?

**Duvarier:** Well then we&#39;ll just look somewhere else. I&#39;m depending on you for pointers, he&#39;s your brother after all.

**Moshwinter:** Then we have our plan. Let us go.

//Moshwinter begins walking forward into the tunnel, gesturing for the others to follow her. Duvarier rushes in front of her and blocks her way, arms spread wide.//

**Duvarier:** Woah hold on a second there madame &#34;no splitting up&#34;, I wasn&#39;t done talking. We&#39;ll have to be real careful down there. We won&#39;t be alone.

**R.Gambi:** I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s related to why there&#39;s no Vanguard presence here?

**Duvarier:** Exactly. See, we— I mean the Foundation used to have a Site down there. But the Impasse crisis pulled a lot of manpower topside. That eventually lead to a big containment breach, and a bunch of nasty shits got loose.

//Moshwinter twitches.//

**Moshwinter:** I&#39;ll ask you to be more respectful when talking about past victims of containment.

**Duvarier:** Oh these weren&#39;t like, people. I&#39;m talking big murder monsters.

**R.Gambi:** And Marcel is in there with those?

**Duvarier:** Potentially. So let&#39;s get a move on, shall we?

//The team walks through the catacombs for several hours. Gambi occasionally takes pictures of places he finds noteworthy such as skull walls, archs, dead ends, decrepit art installations and an alcove furnished with a sleeping bag and a wooden box filled with Victor Hugo books. Duvarier and Moshwinter are often heard arguing in the background.//

//When they encounter crossroads, Moshwinter casts detection spells to choose which paths to take. At times, she instructs the team to avoid looking into certain pathways, citing danger as the reason.//

//As the team arrives at a chamber that splits into another crossroads, Moshwinter prepares to cast the spell again. Suddenly, a small metallic sphere rolls into the chamber and emits a thick, dark smoke that the team&#39;s headlights cannot pierce. They rapidly lose sight of the exits and each other.//

**Unknown:** Get target D-1!

**Duvarier:** What the— bordel!

//Sounds of struggling can be heard, before being covered by Moshwinter&#39;s chanting. When she finishes the spell, a strong breeze blows through the chamber, dissipating the smoke.//

//Duvarier is nowhere to be seen. Nine armed men are now in the chambers, weapons trained on the pair. Moshwinter flicks her wrist and the breeze condenses into a small blizzard around four of the attackers. Chunks of ice begin forming around their bodies. One of the unnafected attackers throws an unidentified powder over his companions and the blizzard stops. Moshwinter is instantly covered in flames but quickly manages to extinguish them.//

**Moshwinter:** Mr Gambi! Run!

//One of the attackers turns towards Gambi and deploys a long catchpole which makes a whirring sound.//

**R.Gambi:** Oh fuck.

//Before the man can reach him, Gambi turns off his headlight and takes out one of the papers from the stack, pressing it against his chest and taking a few steps back. The attacker is briefly startled, then uses his catchpole to jab at the place where Gambi was standing, finding no purchase.//

**Attacker 6:** Target G-2 has gone invisible! I need some fire in that direction!

//Gambi runs into one of the pathways, bullets whizzing past him. He continues running for a few minutes, only stopping when he arrives at a flooded chamber.//

**R.Gambi:** That&#39;s a... [he weezes] a dead end.

//He leans on a wall, panting loudly.//

**R.Gambi:** What the hell was that? Who were these guys? Shit, Duvarier&#39;s gone, Laura&#39;s outnumbered, and I&#39;ve never won a fight in my life, what the hell can I—

//He stops, reacting to a sound not registered by the camera. He takes one of his flashlights out and shines it on the water. Faint ripples are visible.//

**R.Gambi:** [Muttering] Not alone down here.

//He slowly turns around and begins tiptoeing away. After he few steps, he turns to look back at the water for a few moments.//

**R.Gambi:** This is crazy.

//He takes the bag of bacon bites out of his pocket and opens it.// 

**R.Gambi:** No way that&#39;s gonna work.

//He resumes backing away, putting down a bacon bite every few steps. This goes on for a few minutes. When he reaches the last five bites in the bag, he heads back to the chamber, grabs the bites and throws them into the water.//

**R.Gambi:** Fingers crossed...

//A loud roar is heard as a massive shape erupts from the water. It immediately begins swimming towards Gambi.//

**R.Gambi:** Crap.

//He begins running away from the chamber. Loud stomps are heard following after him, as are the sounds of crushed bacon bites.//

**R.Gambi:** Crap, crap, crapcrapcrapcrap.

//He soon arrives at the chamber where the team was ambushed. Moshwinter is kneeling on the floor, shimmering restraints binding her arms and neck. Three of the attackers are scattered around the chamber, lying montionless on the ground. Another three are watching her, the remaining three are shining lights into different pathways.//

//Gambi barges into the chamber, holding his arms in front of his face. The attacker are still unable to see him, but they hear his footsteps and fire in his direction. Gambi flinches and one of his arms slumps to his side. Still, he does not stop.//

//As the stomping sounds get closer to the chamber, the attackers turn their attentions towards the pathway Gambi came from. As they do, he dashes towards Moshwinter. He takes the entire stack of papers from his pocket, tackles Moshwinter to the ground and scatters the papers into the air. Most land on top of them.//

**Moshwinter:** I believe I told you to run.

**R.Gambi:** SHHH! Be very, very quiet.

//The camera is turned towards the ground, raising and lowering as Gambi breathes. Suddenly, the ground shakes as something massive is heard crashing through the pathway&#39;s entrance.//

**Attacker 1:** What the FUCK is that?

**Creature:** ROOOUUUD!

**Attacker 2:** Remember men, it&#39;s not real, it can&#39;t— GWARGH!

//The sound of crushed bones is heard.//

**Attacker 1:** Quick, open fire!

//Gunfire ensues. Something makes a clicking sound and the camera feed goes orange for two seconds before returning to normal.//

**Creature:** Rooouuud?

**Attacker 3:** No you idiot! That only works on mages!

**Attacker 4:** Hold on, I&#39;ve got something else that—

//A lound crunch is heard, followed by masticating.//

**Attacker 1:** Paul! François! No!

**Attacker 5:** Antoine, back me up! Blind it while I get on its back.

**Attacker 6:** Gotcha!

//Something is fired and the camera picks up a distant flash of light.//

**Creature:** ROooOUuuUD!

**Attacker 6:** Wait watch out! It&#39;s going to ro—

//The gound rumbles. Two screams are heard, each followed by a loud squelch.//

**Attacker 1:** YOU FUCKING MONSTER!

//More gunfire, then a fast impact. Something is heard crashing against the wall, then falling to the floor.//

**Creature:** Rouououd. Roud?

//The creature sniffs loudly. Its footsteps come closer to the place where Gambi and Moshwinter are laying down. The pair shuffles quietly, covering their mouths with their hands.//

**Creature:** Five, six... yep, that&#39;s the lot of them. And three freebies! A nice, productive day. Rouhouhouhoud.

//The creature is heard moving around the chamber, then leaves. Its footseps grow farther and farther away. Some things can be heard dragging behind it.//

//Gambi and Moshwinter remain laying down for a while longer.//

**R.Gambi:** Think it&#39;s safe to get up now?

**Unidentified:** I wouldn&#39;t say &#34;safe&#34; — nothing here is — but if you&#39;re referring to the big monster specifically, yeah it&#39;s gone.

//Gambi is startled and jumps to his feet. He spots the speaker: it is Duvarier, sitting on a chunk of the destroyed wall. She is holding a ripped piece of fabric and wrapping it around a bleeding spot on her left thigh.//

**R.Gambi:** Duvarier! You&#39;re alive!

**Duvarier:** Yep. Finished up the guys who took me away and thought I&#39;d come back to help you but... looks like you handled things pretty nicely. 

**R.Gambi:** Do you know who these guys were?

**Moshwinter:** SAPPHIRE, judging by some of the comments they made and their anti-magic equipment.

**R.Gambi:** Yeah speaking of, did they seem... worryingly prepared to you?

**Duvarier:** Yeah this was an ambush, no two ways about it. They were waiting for us, had codenames and all.

**Moshwinter:** Indeed. I heard them call you target D-1, and they referred to me as M-1 while I was bound. But Mr Gambi was—

**R.Gambi:** I was G-2. If they&#39;re using our family names for that, it can only mean that...

**Moshwinter:** That they have a target G-1. And yes, it is most likely your brother.

**R.Gambi:** But why? What have they got against him.

**Duvarier:** Oh that&#39;s easy. Ever since Foundation scientists tried to test his limits, he&#39;s come to see Akiva radiations as a form of energy he can influence. I imagine that a guy who can literally tone down divine power would be of great interest for anti-religion terrorists.

**R.Gambi:** Yeah I never understood that part, so they just tried to see if he could, and that&#39;s why he can do it now?

**Moshwinter:** We do not have the time to discuss the complexities of ontokinetics, but you have to understand that for a lot of reality benders, their powers are limited and shaped by how they think about their abilities and perceive the world around them.

**R.Gambi:** Huh. That&#39;s interesting.

//The team spends a few moments tending to their wounds. Moshwinter leaves the room to mend her robes and insists that no one follow her. During this time, Gambi browses on his phone and saves a few files. When Moshwinter returns, the team resumes progressing through the tunnels. They regularly encounter traces of recent human activity but do not run into any other SAPPHIRE members.//

//As the team enters yet another chamber that splits into different paths, Moshwinter  casts her detection spell and motions the team to head towards the right. Gambi does not follow, instead staring at the left wall.//

**R.Gambi:** Is that...

//He leans closer and focuses his light on a spot of the wall, revealing a small drawing of a star. He then heads further in the left tunnel.//

**Moshwinter:** Mr Gambi! That one read as particularly dangerous!

**Duvarier:** Wait, it looks like he&#39;s got a lead.

//The team progresses through the tunnel, with Gambi in the lead. He is constantly looking at the walls and is too distracted to notice when a hissing sound rapidly approaches from above.//

**Duvarier:** Watch out!

//She pulls Gambi away from where he stood.//

**R.Gambi:** What?

//Suddenly, a loud thump is heard, followed by pained shrieking. The team looks up, seeing what appears to be a large hole in the ceiling. However, that hole is blocked by a seal made of hardened blue foam. The shrieks are coming from behind this seal.//

**Moshwinter:** It appears SAPPHIRE was here before us and secured the way.

**Duvarier:** Yep, and if they thought it was worth the risk going forward, we should be on the right track.

**R.Gambi:** Yeah, but it also means they&#39;re gonna get to Marcel first. We //really// need to hurry.

//The team resumes their progress, at an increased pace. Further inwards, they notice that the ceiling is covered in paintings of the day and night sky, including various shades of blue, clouds, the sun and several stars.//

**R.Gambi:** Looks like he&#39;s gotten better since we were kids. I wonder if they let him get some practice in—

//He is interrupted by loud pained screams coming from further ahead, audibly human in origin. The team members look at each other, nod, and begin sprinting towards the sound. Gambi is easily overtaken by the other two and arrives in the next chamber after them.//

//The chamber is vaguely rectangular, its walls made of rugged and uneven stone. These walls are covered in various paintings, with buckets of paint scattered around the floor. In one corner of the room, some camping equipment is gathered, including an unfolded tent, a small gas oven and several cans of foodstuffs.//

//In the center of the room, three individuals are fighting. One stands a few meters away from the other two, his arms stretched towards them. The other two, identifiable as SAPPHIRE agents by their gear, are writhing on the ground and screaming. As the team gets closer to them, it becomes apparent that their skin is turning red and vapor is emanating from them. The first individual notices the team approaching and flinches.//

**Unknown:** More of you? No! I&#39;m not going back to containment!

//One of the SAPPHIRE agents profits from the individual&#39;s focus being broken to plant a device in the ground. The device, ressembling a small pitchfork, begins to vibrate intensely. Both Moshwinter and the individual grasp their heads and fall to the ground. Duvarier kneels next to Moshwinter and tries to help her up.//

//One of the two SAPPHIRE agents remains unmoving, but the one who planted the device gets up and unholsters a handgun, turning towards the first individual.//

//Gambi dashes towards the SAPPHIRE agent and tries to tackle him, causing him to stumble and miss as he fires.//

**R.Gambi:** DON&#39;T YOU FUCKING HURT HIM!

//Still in pain, the first individual blinks and stares at Gambi. A look of recognition passes on his face.//

**M.Gambi:** R-Ron? Is that [he winces] is that you?

//Ron Gambi prepares to answer but is interrupted by an elbow striking him in the face. He releases his hold of the agent&#39;s back and takes a few steps backwards. The agent then throws him to the ground, kicks him in the chest and attempts to walk away. When he does, Ron Gambi grabs his leg with both hands and pulls, causing him to fall down. They both begin to grapple, but the agent is clearly more trained and soon takes the advantage. Ron Gambi is quickly pinned down and pummeled by face and body blows, which he tries to block as best he can to little success.//

//As the agent grabs hold of his handgun again and aims it towards Ron Gambi, a small canister impacts his face and detonates, releasing a wave of blue foam which covers the agent&#39;s face and quickly hardens. Ron Gambi turns to see that his brother had crawled up to the second SAPPHIRE agent and taken the canister from his belt, but has now collapsed. The agent gets up and tries to tear the foam away from his face, it is clear from his body language that he is panicking. During his stuggle, he stumbles around and trips on an overturned bucket of paint. He falls chest first and is impaled on the pitchfork-like device which breaks under his weight.//

**R.Gambi:** Damn. Are you okay Marcel?

//Marcel Gambi raises a trembling hand and makes a thumbs-up sign. Ron Gambi slowly and painfully gets up, then grasps his brother&#39;s hand and helps him off the ground.//

**M.Gambi:** How? How are you here? I thought they—

**R.Gambi:** Mind wiped me yeah. A lot has happened since then. We&#39;re here to help, you won&#39;t have to hide anymore.

**M.Gambi:** What about mom and dad? Are they okay?

**R.Gambi:** They&#39;re retired now. Got a house down south. They&#39;ll be so happy to see you again.

**M.Gambi:** But weren&#39;t they amnesticized too?

**R.Gambi:** Oh yeah, I guess we&#39;ll have to take care of that first.

//The two of them laugh. They hug, and stay silent for a moment. Marcel Gambi preapares to speak.//

//A gunshot rings out.//

//Both brothers turn to see Moshwinter fall to the ground, hands clutched over her waist. Duvarier stands next to her, shotgun raised. Marcel Gambi immediately extends his hands towards her and focuses. Nothing happens. She taps a harness attached to her chest, which she had not been wearing before.//

**Duvarier:** Ah-ha, none of that now. Heat, eve, electricity or akiva; this little beauty will cancel out anything you throw at me. Had it custom-made in case SAPPHIRE couldn&#39;t do the job. Looks like I was right.

**R.Gambi:** Duvarier! So you&#39;re with SAPPHIRE?

**Duvarier:** Begrudgingly, but yeah. I couldn&#39;t stand these guys back when they were a threat to the Veil, but now they&#39;re a useful asset for my boss. So if he tells me to coordinate an ambush with them, I&#39;ll do it.

**R.Gambi:** But why? Who&#39;s your boss?

**Duvarier:** And why would I tell you that? The whole reason why I&#39;m here is to keep your brother [she turns her weapon towards Marcel Gambi] from running his mouth.

//Marcel Gambi shudders at the sight of the shotgun. Ron Gambi begins to search through his pockets.//

**R.Gambi:** I&#39;m not gonna let you do that, you know.

**Duvarier:** Good point. Let me take care of that.

//She presses a switch on her weapon and fires it at Ron Gambi. A net is shot, the impact propelling him against the wall before the net deploys and restrains him. Duvarier advances towards him, shoving Marcel Gambi as he tries to stand in her way.//

**Duvarier:** You know, that was a perfectly good ambush back there. How the hell did you manage to screw it up for us?

**R.Gambi:** Honestly? I had a plan that didn&#39;t work as expected, but then things just kinda turned out alright. So, is that thing specifically made to counter my brother?

**Duvarier:** Yep, commissioned it from R&amp;D. Something that specific is hard to make, but luckily there is //extensive// testing data on all your brother&#39;s known abilities, so they were able to manage. Were those your last words?

**R.Gambi:** No. Alexandra, please read out my last saved file in &#34;things to talk about with Marcel&#34;!

**ALEXANDRA.AIC:** Sure thing! From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: &#34;In physics, the kinetic energy of an object is the energy that it possesses due to its motion. It is defined as the work needed to accelerate a body of a given mass from rest to its stated velocity. Having gained this energy during its acceleration, the body maintains this kinetic energy unless its speed changes—&#34;

//Duvarier turns to see Ron Gambi&#39;s phone on the ground next to his brother. She presses her weapon&#39;s switch again and fires, the bullets destroy the phone and stop ALEXANDRA.AIC&#39;s voice.//

//Duvarier and Marcel Gambi stare at each other. Both appear to realise something, as Marcel&#39;s eyes briefly glow purple. Duvarier aims her weapon again and fires, Marcel Gambi raises his hands. The bullets drop in mid-air. Duvarier freezes in place.//

//Ron Gambi struggles to get free but fails to escape the net. Marcel Gambi keeps his focus on Duvarier, who is now moving at an almost imperceptible pace. For a minute, nothing happens. Then, in the background, Moshwinter&#39;s body jerks upright. She rubs her hands together and fires  a volley of blue arcane bolts, striking Duvarier who collapses to the ground as Marcel Gambi lets go.//

//Moshwinter shivers, and a number of large lead pellets falls from her sleeve, drenched in a blue liquid.//

**Moshwinter:** Gah, this hurt like h— I mean, thank you both for keeping her busy until I recovered. I think it would be best if we all went home now, with the prisoners of course.

//Duvarier twitches, her voice rasping.//

**Duvarier:** All my life, I served the Foundation&#39;s mission. I can&#39;t stand this new world but... at least I won&#39;t need to live in it anymore. [She coughs] I always knew I&#39;d die in the dark.

//She grunts, and swallows something. Her whole body begins to bloat and glow. Moshwinter runs towards the two brothers.//

**Duvarier:** I&#39;m sorry, Five.

//A bright light engulfs the scene, and the camera&#39;s footage goes dead.//

-----

**Afterword**: Coinciding with the loss of footage, a large underground detonation caused a shopping mall in Paris to collapse. Luckily, as the location was closed due to all the employees being on strike, no life was lost. 

During the excavation, both Gambi brothers, along with Vice-chief Moshwinter were recovered alive, although each with a number of injuries. Marcel Gambi had used his powers to shield the group from the explosion and hold back the falling rubble; while Moshwinter kept the air circulation, allowing them to breathe. Ron Gambi had already fainted from blood loss prior to extraction, the other two passed out from exhaustion shortly after being rescued.

Marcel Gambi is to be debriefed after he recovers. The primary objective will be to ascertain the location of the man formerly known as O5-5.

//A flash of light.//
//You blink yourself awake and turn. You and your brother stare at each other from your hospital beds.//
//You point to your right arm in a blank cast and ask if he wants to keep practicing his art on it.//
//He says he&#39;d love to, although he&#39;s a little high on painkillers to see colours properly right now.//
//You both laugh.//

//You both extend your arms across the short distance between your beds. Your hands clasp.//
//It&#39;s a poor substitute for a hug, but you squeeze.//
//Tight.//
//And you don&#39;t let go.//
