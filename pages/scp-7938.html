**Item #:** SCP-7938

**Object Class:** Neutralized

**Secondary Class:** Mutually Dependent[[footnote]] Item consists of two or more separate, non-anomalous entities that require the other to maintain anomalous properties. [[/footnote]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** Given the 1981 World Chess Championship, the sporadic nature in which SCP-7938 manifested, and the 2016 expiration of SCP-7938-B, future SCP-7938 events have been deemed impossible. No containment procedures are required, and SCP-7938&#39;s primary containment class has been designated, &#34;Neutralized&#34;.

**Description:** SCP-7938 was a supposed reality-bending temporal anomaly that occurred between July 18, 1978 - October 18, 1978. SCP-7938 consisted of SCP-7938-A, known as &#34;Anatoly Karpov&#34;, and SCP-7938-B, known as &#34;Viktor Korchnoi&#34;. The hypothesized manifestation of SCP-7938 is believed to have been contingent on the competition of both SCP-7938-A and SCP-7938-B in the 1978 World Chess Championship.

**Discovery:** SCP-7938 was brought to the attention of the Foundation on October 18, 1978, when numerous transcribed chess games and recorded television broadcasts were found to have been documented on the SCP-7938 file. The validity of the existence of SCP-7938 is unverifiable, as information regarding the anomaly only exists within the SCP file.

Upon being interviewed, SCP-7938-A and SCP-7938-B claimed to have no recollection of SCP-7938. Eyewitness information received suggested upon analysis that the relationship of SCP-7938-A and SCP-7938-B was at least partially altered following the supposed conclusion of SCP-7938 from what it was prior.

The 1978 World Chess Championship was an event where the first player to win six games would become the World Chess Champion. Per FIDE rules, a win would count towards 1 point for the victor, 0 points for the loser, and a draw would result in both players gaining 0.5 points.

+++ Game #1, July 18 | 1978
-----
[[/=]]

**Result:** Draw

**Termination:** Unwilling bodily-movement

**Details:** After 52 minutes, both players agreed to a draw and exited the room. Both players re-entered the room after 5-minutes and resumed the chess game for 254 moves until no further moves were theoretically possible. Staff that attempted to intervene were terminated via blunt force trauma.

**Aftermath:** 21,900 civilians have been terminated by SCP-7938 in Baguio, Philippines. An evacuation was rapidly enacted during initial containment attempts.

**Result:** Draw

**Termination:** Torn vocal cords

**Details:** SCP-7938-A and SCP-7938-B proceeded to verbally berate each other for 49 consecutive hours. Game ceased with no progress made as both player&#39;s vocal cords were rendered unable to produce sound.

**Aftermath:** An emergency meeting between the Ethics Committee, the Unreality Department, --O5-12--[[footnote]] Unavailable. [[/footnote]] O5-9, Mike Carlsen from the Site-17 Janitorial Staff, and the entire civilian population of Cuba was convened to determine a resolution pertaining to SCP-7938.

**Resolution:** Assassinate Nigel Short 1 second after he becomes a Chess Grandmaster.[[footnote]] Resolution failed after the assassination was completed 1.4 seconds following Nigel Short becoming a Grandmaster. [[/footnote]]

**Result:** SCP-7938-A winning

**Termination:** Cannibalism

**Details:** After 17 moves, SCP-7938-A proceeded to assault and disembowel SCP-7938-B over a period of 49 minutes. SCP-7938-A consumed approximately 91.31% of SCP-7938-B&#39;s body mass. The remaining 8.69% of SCP-7938-B&#39;s person proceeded to reconstruct itself into a functioning brain and skeletal system and resign, prior to exiting the facilities of the match and expiring.

**Aftermath:** A bovine in London[[footnote]] Close in proximity to London. [[/footnote]] rapidly assumed the form of SCP-7938-B shortly following the conclusion of the game. A second bovine in close proximity rapidly assumed the form of a business suit that SCP-7938-B promptly adorned.

The rancher has been compensated for the loss of her cows with an equal weight of McDonald&#39;s ketchup packets[[footnote]] Each partially used. [[/footnote]].

**???:** And that there is the conclusion of the 30th game of the Championship.

//Still frames appear on-screen depicting two humanoids without skin sitting around a chessboard.//

**???:** Standard tactics have been utilized in the game, which culminated in a draw. Given the lack of interesting content across the past and following several days, we have scheduled an interview with the organizer of the 1978 WCC.

//The feed cuts and transitions to the upper body of the same entity standing in a different room. The entity talks in a slightly deeper pitch of voice.//

**???:** Greetings to chess players and casual watchers across the world! Many of you who are familiar with chess may not recognize me as a commentator. So who am I? Well-

//The entity laughs.//

**???:** We are here for the players and the beautiful game they have been playing. So simply think of me as a being brought into this world a few decades ago, exclusively to let the world know about the updates in the day-to-day lives of these men!

+++ Global Emergency Alert Message

[[/=]]
**Note:** The message appears to have been sent by the Foundation through the hijacking of an existing television broadcast, rather than the standard Emergency Alert System. Television hijacking equipment utilized was shown to either be faulty, or inherently weaker than the signal of the broadcast it was trying to intercept.

-----

//Various personnel are seen on screen, with Site-84 Director Castle is standing center on-screen.//

Do not panic. This is an emergency alert message broadcast globally by the SCP Foundation. You do not know who we are, as we have operated in the shadows. After this is resolved, you may learn that later. But currently, our ##F5F5F5|main focus is on## the security and safety of the world. For the past 24 hours, numerous reality-altering events have occurred. You may have experienced these events firsthand. ##F5F5F5|This event was created by a temporal anomaly that wishes to## destroy everyone you love and hold dear. We will ##F5F5F5|not## let this happen. We are working our best to contain the anomaly, ##F5F5F5|and will not## stop ##F5F5F5|until we have tried to## give ##F5F5F5|everything we can to protect civilians affected. If you are able to, enter a safe facility and bunker in place for the next 24 hours. Remain in place until the time is## up.

//TV static is heard for 19 seconds.//

In the event that you or a loved one appear to have been terminated by the anomaly, or appear to replicate the status of an expired individual, please relocate the affected individual outside of the place in which you are barricaded. Corpses are ##F5F5F5|dangerous to leave around and present a## great ##F5F5F5|risk to your health via bacterial disease. Discard any food you have on hand that appears## to smell.

//The TV feed cuts to black.//

**Aftermath:** A 54-hour break was declared so players could rest. The immediate family of both SCP-7938-A and SCP-7938-B were teleported in front of them as concrete surrounding both players assumed the form of restraints against them. Both players were subsequently forced to stand in place with both eyes open at their families. All family members present faced anomalous alteration, including the rapid growth of additional limbs, the growth of excess flesh and skin, the transformation of skin into cartilage, incineration, and forced vocalization. After the break concluded, all individuals were installed as a permanent addition to the playing venue. Both players were released and allowed to continue playing games.

**Result:** Draw

**Termination:** Repeated-atomic disintegration

**Details:** A figure grows angrier and angrier as each day goes on that threatens to be the same.

**Aftermath:** We are not here. We are not ruling from Tokyo to La Paz. We are not able to pray. We are not dead. We are not alive. We are not stupid. We are not able to resist. We are not able to work in departments. We are not able to secure. We are not able to contain. We are not able to protect. We are not able to express our sorrow. We are not able to speak. We are not able to run. We are not able to rely on the O5, the Committee, the Unreality, the Fire Suppressionists, the five Tau, the Shark Punchers, or the failsafes. We are not the failsafe anymore. We are not in control. We are not in the 5,000. We are not good at chess. We are not what we were.

##F5F5F5|I&#39;m sorry about your family.##

@@@@

##F5F5F5|I should have said that earlier.##

##F5F5F5|I just-##

##F5F5F5|Didn&#39;t think of what you saw.##

##F5F5F5|I never really did. I always thought that-##

@@@@

@@@@
@@@@
@@@@
@@@@
@@@@

##F5F5F5|That you were just wrong. San Marino was, and still is, a state that I can not live in. Not anymore.##

##F5F5F5|We were living the best life. Heroes of our nation. Two of the three best chess players in the world, with the third being some American antisemite.##

We are at the mercy of those two who are right, left, wrong, right, and in the center of it all.

##F5F5F5|No way. Seriously?##

##F5F5F5|Yes but without the sarcasm!##

##F5F5F5|Let&#39;s calm down. We might only have a few minutes.##

##F5F5F5|What if we die? Does that end it?##

##F5F5F5|It wouldn&#39;t work, either.##

##F5F5F5|Viktor, think of how many times we died. We can&#39;t just die one more time and have it be over. Even if we tried 3,999 times.##

**Result:** SCP-7938-A winning

**Termination:** Resignation

**Details:** SCP-7938-A, who held the white pieces, gradually would score a tactical advantage in the Classical Pirc. Though mostly evenly balanced throughout the game, on move 35 SCP-7938-A began to gain the advantage prior to a series of blunders by SCP-7938-B, causing massive material loss. On move 41, seeing no way to recover the position, SCP-7938-B resigned the game, resulting in SCP-7938-A winning the World Chess Championship.

**Aftermath:** What happened never happened. We will make sure it never happens again.

[[/div]]

SCP-7938 concluded after 391 years with SCP-7938-A winning 28,544.5 - 28,443.5 against SCP-7938-B.
