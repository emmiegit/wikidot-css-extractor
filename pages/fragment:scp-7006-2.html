**The Parable of the Thief**

She was a Magpie at birth.
She coveted what others possessed.
Jealousy was Her name.
She would steal everything that glittered and shone,
And secret them away in Her nest.

When She came upon the City,
She saw it as an orchard.
Ripe with things She did not own.
She coveted its greatest treasure:
Its people.

She knew nothing of temperance, of moderation,
Of what to steal and what to leave behind.
She stole gold and silver,
But also secrets, and wonder.

The world soon had nothing left to rob,
For all belonged to the Magpie, 
And Her bony fingers.

There is a singular device that was once in possession of the Foundation for Securement, Containment and Protection, a machine that opened portals into a chaotic dimension which transmogrified anything within. One portal led into the dimension; the other led out. Whatever was placed into the portal exited the other side either destroyed, remade, or rebuilt into something better. The portals were fickle in nature, but some degree of control could be wielded over them.

As our adventure begins, the device has been stolen by agents of the **Cult of Chaos**, an organization which craves nothing less than the destruction of the Foundation. They wish to harness the chaotic dimension beyond the portals to bring forth a world of disorder, where nothing is certain and reality is continually remade. To do this, they must travel to a location in the deep wilderness: the so-called **Pitted City**, so known for a portal in its center masquerading as a bottomless pit. They intend to throw this machine into the Pit, so that the chaotic, changing dimension within will overtake our reality.

They must be stopped.

The Pitted City is a quaint community, barely thirty-thousand people. There are homes at the edge of town, a central boulevard that curves slightly, and a bevy of places to visit and enjoy, from parks to the small lake nearby-- if only you were not here on business. Alas. Your destination is atop a hill on the eastern end of town, and having come from Outpost #17, you are approaching from the west. It is a beautiful autumn morning as you enter the area, leaves churning in the breeze, birdsong in the air as the migratory flocks bid farewell to the north for the year, and the town is... is...

...Where are all the people?

You were told this town was inhabited, that it was busy. It is currently 10:00 in the morning, and there is not a soul in sight, not a vehicle on the road. All of the shops are still shuttered along Main Street. But your destination is in sight.

At the top of the hill sits a seemingly innocuous building of bricks and glass and dreary business. Below, however, the true Outposts exists, fourteen levels of corridors and rooms which are made for life, work, study-- and of course, containment.

The lobby, as with the rest of the town, is devoid of human life when you enter-- but not devoid of human remains. A human-like body, arms and legs too long to be truly human, lays splayed on the ground before the elevators leading down, looking almost as if they were stretched to death.

Thankfully, their face does not match that of any member of the Foundation.

Characters with medical knowledge will be able to determine that he died due to his heart not being able to pump enough blood throughout his body-- such a mundane death for such a strange creature. Searching the body reveals a small ritual knife (d6) and a drawing of what appears to be a pair of glowing portals.

Players will find that the elevators are in lockdown mode, and stop at the first sublevel. From there, they must traverse using the stairwell. A rundown of the Outpost, and any valuable items they may find, are below.

------

**1st Sublevel:** //This is a heavily fortified sublevel. It&#39;s plain to see why; the barracks are located here, just past the non-functional elevators. Out to the left is the armory, and straight ahead is a hallway littered with bullet holes and bodies-- all of the bodies are wearing scarlet robes.//

Give the Avatars some time to poke around; a search of the bodies will find numerous small knives and what appear to be prayer books written in an unknown language. Nothing of note, however. When they continue:

//As you proceed down the hall, one of the bodies twitches, and then explodes, shooting viscera in all directions. The gore then starts to... meld together, into a scarlet, fleshy lump. Shards of bone stick out of it at odd angles. It screams, and several other corpses explode; the same thing happens to them. Soon, you&#39;re faced with a dozen misshapen lumps of flesh, and they lunge at you.//

Should the party enter the armory, read this portion:

//The armory contains two first-aid kits and two assault rifles (d6). It&#39;s been picked clean beyond that, and there are signs that whoever was in here got out in a hurry-- except not everyone is out. A researcher stands in the corner, shaking, his breath raspy; he has clearly been crying for a very long time. He is standing over the body of an agent. He turns on you, raising a pistol-- it clicks empty. He yelps out a scream; you think he says: &#34;Get away from me&#34; or &#34;Don&#39;t let me die!&#34; but it might also just be a sob.//

This researcher will introduce himself as **Dr. Armand Penn**. He is of no threat to any entity in this module, and as such, has not been allocated statistics. Dr. Penn will explain that he was visiting a friend of his in the barracks when the Cult of Chaos stormed the Site, to **Sublevel 14** (Containment). He does not know their motive, nor does he care; his best friend is dead. He will say that **Sublevel 10** is home to the **Organic Separator**, a project of his that may come in handy, and hands over the access code to his lab: &#34;//THUNDER ROLLED A SIX//&#34;.

Dr. Penn should be played as though he is a somewhat egotistical man, but heavily shaken, and despondent. He will ask to be left to mourn his friend, and will assure the party that there aren&#39;t any bullets left in the armory.

Increased searching of the armory will reveal:

//By the armory is a firing range, and at the far end, an incinerated target. A note on the range reads: &#34;Experimental weapons returned to R &amp; D, sublevel 6.&#34;//

------

**2nd Sublevel:** //Ten inches of lead plate bar the way into this floor, dented and scored by bullets and knives. A &#34;5&#34; is scratched into the doorway. However, this seems to be a safe area; there&#39;s no viscera, and you hear no disturbance from above or below. You may take a quick rest here.//

//However, as you try to continue, your realize the stairs have... turned organic. There are pustules between here and the next landing. A light prod makes it discharge a fluid that is milky yellow and smells putrid. You may not want to step on it.//

Characters must make a DEX Save to traverse the stairs. On a failure, they land safely, but their Hit Prevention is depleted as they use up all their luck.

------

**3rd Sublevel:**//This level contains Outpost #87&#39;s living quarters. Off of the landing, there is a set of smaller stairs that leads into a common area; it would be a nice place, if not for the burns and the omni-present bullet holes. There is a light amount of gore here, as well. Only a few rooms seem to not be barricaded; everywhere that looks like it could be a bedroom has the locks broken to render them inaccessible.//

//There are a few rooms that were not inhabited, and they contain entertainment such as a small library that has been ransacked, books thrown on the floor in an attempt to search for something. In this same room are several interrupted board and card games, pieces strewn on the floor.//

Players may be allowed to explore; they will find some first-aid kits and, if they are persistent, a die that, when rolled, always comes up as its highest result. Holding this grants **+1 Stability**. Should they proceed, they will walk by the Mess Hall.

//As you walk by the mess, you hear something from within-- gunfire! A single shot, followed by a mournful voice saying, &#34;Had to be done. He could have given up intel if he lived.&#34;//

//&#34;Had to be done,&#34; a second voice agrees. &#34;The Foundation cannot be allowed to retain the Portals.&#34;//

//Looking in, you see that the mess is in a sorry state; lumps of flesh, similar to the ones you saw above, are deflated all over the room. A poor cafeteria worker&#39;s body is slumped over the salad bar. Tables are upturned, and it&#39;s clear from the position of at least one body that the Foundation agents would rather have died than have been captured.//

//In the center, a pair of robed figures in the mess. Both of them look human. Both of them have assault rifles, and are standing over the corpse of a third. They are searching his body for something, and don&#39;t seem to have noticed you yet. What do you do?//

Using this device fully restores a single statistic to full, in exchange for fatigue; the same person cannot use this twice in twenty-four hours without becoming deprived.

**5th Sublevel:** //A large, ornate and very out of place door that seems to be made out of brass blocks the way into this sublevel. Knocking on it or trying to open it results in a hatch opening, and a shotgun emerging, with a man&#39;s voice snarling, &#34;What&#39;s the passcode?&#34;//

Upon seeing that the Avatars do not know the code, the voice will fire a warning shot. If the Avatars explain the situation, they will be told they can be granted an audience with Dr. Sheridan-- head of the Outpost for the time being-- if they can tell them the passphrase.

Learning the passphrase &#34;//Library Card//&#34; from Sublevel 7 will grant access.

Sublevel 5 is dedicated to metaphysical studies, including magic-- but for now, it&#39;s a safe haven. Most of Outpost #87&#39;s personnel are sheltering here, and at the center, in her laboratory, is **Dr. Phoenix Sheridan**. Dr. Sheridan explains that she is maintaining a spell that phased the rest of the town&#39;s inhabitants of the Pitted City into an alternate dimension, to keep them safe from the incursion of the Cultists of Chaos. It is clear that this spell is taking a heavy toll on her, however, and it cannot be maintained for much longer without killing her.

Dr. Sheridan will explain the broad strokes of what is happening: the Portals of Chaos were transported here from Outpost #17 for study, but the Cultists of Chaos, who oppose the Foundation at every turn, infiltrated the Outpost and attempted to overtake it. They fought back the best they could, but without Director Keep to lift the lockdown, they&#39;re reduced to sheltering down here.

Dr. Sheridan is a woman approximately forty years of age, and is very knowledgeable of the arcane. She is normally very cheerful and talkative, but she is clearly in large amounts of pain from having to maintain such a powerful spell.

From here onwards, reality has become incoherent. Each sublevel has terrain far different from what has been encountered before.

//Sublevel 7, from what you could gather, was for research of physical phenomena. It seems appropriate, then, that this area is now very, very physically active; the walls are made out of metal and shake with a mechanical rhythm, while the ground seems to be made out of volcanic rock. Steam rises when you take a step, and gouts of fire gutter all around. And all the time, the rhythm, the rhythm, the CHUNK-CHUNK-CHUNK of some great machine comes from all around, CHUNK-CHUNK-CHUNK, is it grinding? Is the room moving, or are you? CHUNK-CHUNK-CHUNK. The rhythm calls to you, CHUNK-CHUNK-CHUNK, pulling you into the fire--//

A CTRL Save must be made to not be pulled into the fire by the rhythm. Any Avatars that succeed may restrain those who failed, and pull them along the way. If all fail, they walk into the fire, take 1 Damage, and are released from the enchantment.

------

**8th Sublevel:** //As you proceed to this sublevel, upon the stairwell, you discover a well-loved purple **Hamsa Amulet** (+1 Stability).//

//This sublevel was, apparently, dedicated to theoretical studies. It appears to have been overtaken by something that resembles both a clean, white operating theater and a classroom. Desiccated humanoid husks sit at desks, odd devices strapped over their heads, all observing a shark-like entity being dissected on a table.//

//A light permeates the room, from top to bottom. A voice speaks, &#34;Take your seats, students. Class is now in session.&#34;//

This voice will grow more and more insistent, but nothing will happen if the Avatars do not take a place in vacant seats and wish to simply move on. If they decide to do so, however, they must make a CTRL Save, as a headset is lowered onto their face, and their mind is filled with knowledge that is incompatible with their native universe. Failure to do so will mean they must sit through the &#34;lesson&#34;, and take 2 Stress.

------

**9th Sublevel:** //As you proceed to this sublevel, upon the stairwell, you find a leather bound tome. The cover reads: &#34;If found, return to M. Hex-Cavendish&#34;.// Reading this allows the party to roll the spell &#34;//Ghost Beast//&#34;, which summons a spectral **Common Hodag** to fight for you.

//This place is... odd. It// looks //like Outpost #87, but there are no signs of strife or struggle, no signs of fighting. A sign on the wall reads &#34;Site-87, Sloth&#39;s Pit, Wisconsin&#34;.&#39;//

//A member of staff exits a door sipping at some coffee. This researcher, a woman with dark hair and flower-shaped earrings, gives you an odd look and asks, &#34;Is it Wednesday?&#34;// Regardless of how they answer, she will reply, //&#34;I swear to god it&#39;s a Wednesday. We always have dimensional incursions on Wednesdays. Well, feel free to rest up here.&#34;//

The party may take a Quick Rest here before proceeding. There is no danger on this floor, but any researchers they encounter will not interact with them further, muttering something about &#34;timeline collapses being a bad idea&#34;.

------

**10th Sublevel:** //This staircase is, disappointingly, vacant.//

//The 10th Sublevel looks like a charnel house, in a literal sense-- every inch that you can see is made out of flesh, and it is all screaming, groaning, sobbing, or otherwise pleading to be released. Most of it looks distressingly human. There are eyes on the walls, soaked with tears.// Players making direct eye contact with the walls take 1 Stress.

The party should press on. As they do so, ask &#34;Are you sure?&#34; after some actions. Not after every action and not every time, but some. Give them a sense of worry and trepidation. Should they press on far enough:

//Flesh has completely overtaken this level, in short. Doors have been replaced by mouths, chairs have been replaced by legs, and desks are made out of arms.//

Searching this area will reveal some first-aid kits that need to be pulled free of the flesh, as well as a sawed-off shotgun (d8 Blast) being held by arms sticking out of a wall.

//There is a portion of the area that is free of gore, almost looking like the ordinary Outpost #87. The door, however, is sealed.// It can be opened with Dr. Penn&#39;s passcode, &#34;//THUNDER ROLLED A SIX//&#34;. //Within it is a large green-ish... cannon-- is the best word you can think of for it, except it&#39;s just small enough to be held with two hands. It has a trigger and a muzzle, and a note on it reads: &#34;DO NOT POINT AT UNALTERED FLESH-- DR. PENN&#34;.//

This is the **Organic Separator**, a Bulky d8 Blast weapon which is capable of separating grafted, spliced, mutated, or otherwise intermixed organic matter into its separate components. Critical Damage melts non-grafted organic matter into an indistinguishable puddle. A single hit is capable of destroying any Chaos Lumps you encounter, regardless of Damage. And that&#39;s a good thing-- because two dozen of them now drop down from the ceiling.

Firing the Organic Separator creates collateral damage, which in this case means:

//As you fire the weapon, the flesh on the walls... reconstitutes itself into people. Naked people, scared people, but living people nonetheless. They simply try to stay out of your way the weapon does its work.//

------

**11th Sublevel:** //The stairway leading down here contains three dead Cultists of Chaos. Their body armor looks useful.// Gain 3 pieces of body armor. (+1 Armor)

//You seem to find yourselves in a city-- well, in a building that&#39;s in a city. An apartment building, to be precise. There are people here, in the hallway, smoking, drinking, socializing. They look like people, but... there&#39;s something off about each of them. That woman with a mesh shirt leaning against the wall has the eyes of a lizard, while you swear the young man squatting and drinking from a bottle of whiskey has ears long enough to fit under his tall hat.//

//All the same, it seems... safe here. Pleasant. You can make Quick Rest here, but why stop at that? People here seem friendly, and... someone&#39;s coming out the door next to you. It&#39;s an older woman, who seems to have the face of a mouse. She&#39;s offering you cookies. This place is probably well-fortified enough to weather the storm...//

A CTRL Save must be made to resist the allure of this floor and proceed. In the unlikely event of all members of the party failing, the Warden may fiat that there is a success instead. The entities will not be hostile, just... disappointed.

------

**12th Sublevel:** //The first thing you notice here is the cold.//

//The second thing you notice is the snow. It is freezing in here, and looking up, you can see open sky. It&#39;s a tundra, and at the center, in the near distance, is a large, circular, golden portal, surrounded by the remains of what was once a laboratory. There is blood all over the snow, but... something&#39;s odd. You&#39;ve seen some of these bodies on other levels. It occurs to you that the MUTA might be spitting out alternate-universe replicas here.//

They will find nothing but small arms (d6 pistols) on corpses they search.

//Atop a console in front of the Multi-Universal Transit Array is a corpse whose nametag reads &#34;T. KEEP&#34;. The corpse is frost-bitten and stuck to the console; his hand was on an &#34;Emergency Shutoff&#34; button.//

Should the players try to move him:

//The cadaver squirms to life. There is a sound that resembles cicadas on a hot summer day, and then the body disintegrates into dozens, if not hundreds, of individual organisms; not quite worms, not quite spiders, not quite insects. And they are clearly very protective of the console.//

Falstaff and Wright are both counted as allies for the purposes of combat, and act at the same time as the Avatars. Wright will retrieve an assault rifle (d6) (if she is not armed by the players) to engage in combat. If they are not freed, the party will have to face all eight Cultists of Chaos, as well as the Festering Chaos Lump.

Should they engage in open violence, Keep and the Cultist will leap through the portal. The resulting rain of viscera will cause enough Stress to render (d6) Cultists unconscious, and bring forth the Festering Chaos Lump.

//Keep and the Cultist are dragged into the portal. What emerges on the other side is a conglomeration of limbs, teeth, heads, and an inexplicable wing. It screams, grabs a cultist, and devours it. It&#39;s at least half as tall as the room, and it bears down upon you, rabid with the agony of its existence.//

@@@@
The Portals of Chaos lead to a chaotic extradimensional space that warps any matter-- solid, liquid, gaseous, organic, inorganic, and all else in between-- in purely random ways. Sometimes, objects emerged unchanged. Other times, they emerge completely different. Sometimes, they don&#39;t emerge at all.

The players are able to enter the Portals of Chaos. If they do, they must make a CTRL Save. Provided a success, the character emerges unaffected. On a failure, the character emerges alive, but is deprived and must take a Stress Fallout.

Other objects can enter the Portals; see below for a rough estimate of what should occur in this circumstance.
