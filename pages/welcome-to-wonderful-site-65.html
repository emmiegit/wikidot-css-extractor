&gt; Dr. Berker, 
&gt; 
&gt; I think you know full well that this isn&#39;t what I meant when I asked you to draft up an orientation pamphlet. Come see me immediately.
&gt; 
&gt; [[&gt;]]
&gt; Dr. Williams

++++ Congratulations! 

------

Because of your extraordinary talents and skills, you have been specially selected from your peers for an employment opportunity and/or involuntary volunteer position with the SCP Foundation! Get ready to leave behind everything you&#39;ve ever loved, and prepare to be immersed within the magical, wonderful, and sometimes terrifying world known as Site-65!

------

++++ What is Site-65?

[[include component:image-block

caption=NOT an anomaly!]]

Site-65 is located just 30-kilometers north of Saskatoon in the beautiful prairie fields of Saskatchewan, Canada. The location was officially chosen due to its isolation and vast flat area, but don&#39;t be afraid to stop and admire the real reason Site-65 was built where it stands... the amazing sights! When not being blinded by dust storms, the worn and treaded prairies present ample opportunity to observe any local wildlife not yet decimated by industrial activity.

With beauty comes danger, however, and you must maintain a keen eye at all times. Practice a lot to ensure you can identify the differences between the common field rat and the anomalous prairie skin snatcher. (Hint: it&#39;s the shape of the tail!) To help you out when it comes to identifying whether an animal is anomalous or not, try to remember this fun little motto: &#34;Prairie dog in the grass? Stop, watch, have a laugh. [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5118 Golden dog without a leash?] That&#39;s called a containment breach!&#34;

Besides enjoying all that nature offers, staff at Site-65 work vigorously around the clock to safely contain and research various anomalies. Additionally, the eastern portion of Site-65 is publicly operated as a cement production facility under contract with the federal government which, in turn, has allowed it to receive steady continued funding. Site-65 cooperates with Site-177 and remotely leads [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5121 Site-AE7] to form the SCP Foundation Saskatchewan Operational Region.

------

++++ Names to Know

------

Before you walk into Site-65 with your head held high and ready for your first assignment, you&#39;re going to need to memorize some of the big names! The following is not a complete list of all your co-workers, so make sure you get to know everyone you&#39;ll be working with (during your 15-minute lunch break, of course)!

**Regional Director:** Dr. Atmos
Dr. Atmos has worked for the SCP Foundation since before anyone on Site-65 remembers. He says he&#39;s only been here for twenty-something years, but other staff who have been around longer recall being trained by him. Other than that, Dr. Atmos is relatively straightforward to work with if you stay on his good side. He has a very keen eye for details that others miss which makes him a valuable asset during reviews. He doesn&#39;t work directly at Site-65 the majority of the time as he coordinates all Foundation sites within Saskatchewan, Canada.

**Regional Containment Specialist:** Dr. Laicux
Dr. Laicux started with the SCP Foundation in 1991 and is responsible for reviewing and revising established containment procedures. At times, Dr. Laicux participates in the initial establishment of procedures as well, though this task is generally assigned to the Site Director. Dr. Laicux is known as --kind of a dick-- one of the Foundation&#39;s more sarcastic assets, though his skills and knowledge are nevertheless extremely valuable.

**Site Director:** Dr. Williams
Dr. Williams has worked exclusively as Site-65&#39;s Director since joining the SCP Foundation in 1992. Dr. Williams takes great interest in reality-altering and bending anomalies and, despite lacking attention to detail, has displayed an above-average understanding of such occurrences. Dr. Williams is known to be strictly clinical, interpreted at times as cruel, when necessary in order to further the goals of the Foundation. These skills have allowed Dr. Williams to successfully manage Site-65 with only --6-- --7-- --8-- 9 critical incidents in the most recent reporting period.

++++ Company Events

| align=left]]

At Site-65, morale is almost as important as the amount of work you put in! We understand that and to help bolster our team spirit, Site-65 holds special events regularly for you and your coworkers to participate in. These range from small staff parties to larger events like car raffles!^^*^^

Tasks have been carefully implemented in each event to allow all attending employees to continue being productive while enjoying some time to relax. For example, during one year&#39;s employee car raffle, participants received one additional entry for each person they could recruit to the D-Class program (see attached photo)! 

^^*^^,,As Foundation employees are prohibited from leaving their assigned facilities and reintegrating into the public, all vehicle rewards are automatically forfeited.,,

++++ Conclusion

------

If you&#39;re experiencing an increased heart rate, sweating, and sheer excitement, worry not! Anomalous effects are not besting you; you are simply experiencing the thrill and rush of working for Site-65 (unless your eyes turn into honey, in which case please report immediately to the nearest medical ward).

&#34;But what about my wife? My kids? My family?&#34; All are justified worries, of course! We recognize that your departure from the public eye and into the veil of the Foundation may leave loved ones to wonder where you&#39;ve gone and submit a pesky missing person report. Proactivity is key at the Foundation, which is why while you&#39;ve been reading we&#39;ve taken the liberty of amnestizing everyone with knowledge of your existence. So don&#39;t worry about your old boss calling or your wife and kids missing you... They don&#39;t even know who you are!
