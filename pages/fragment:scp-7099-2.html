**Special Containment Procedures:** Mass produced Ushu Narrative Anchors (UNA) will be deployed around the Foundation&#39;s facilities and database servers worldwide to prevent the effects of SCP-7000. A total of 40 A-Z7K.aic will be constantly monitoring the database for SCP-7000 impact detection and correction.

If a space or an area on the database is found to be severely affected by SCP-7000, an UNA will be set up after an investigation by Mobile Task Force Alpha-70 (“Those Who Resist”).

The existence of this report is also a countermeasure to effectively contain the effects of SCP-7000, since a good understanding of the causes of SCP-7000 triggers the weakening of the phenomenon. However, the release of information for low-level clearance has been deemed unnecessary, and inadvertent release is considered a violation of protocol as it could inadvertently destabilize the entity.

A detailed explanation of the existence of the Foundation&#39;s administrative structure outside of the English-speaking world through natural means to all Foundation personnel is recommended.

**Description:** SCP-7000 is a destabilizing phenomenon of multiverse existence within the base narrative layer caused by a collective lack of perception/knowledge of information/concepts described or associated with a non-English language in multiple narrative layers, including the base narrative layer. The phenomenon of object non-existence based on lack or rejection of recognition [[[SCP-5309|has already been confirmed in known studies]]]. However, unlike those occurring in individual intellects, the SCP-7000 anomaly is caused by interlingual collective intelligence among multiple narrative layers. It is currently assumed that the SCP-7000 is mainly influenced by the upper narrative layer, but it is believed that this problem can be solved by adequately suppressing the phenomena originating from within the base narrative layer.

The SCP-7000-affected entities are collectively designated SCP-7000-A, and most of the time their existence, as well as their information, has been erased. Based on the percentage of languages used in the Foundation&#39;s database, it is estimated that approximately 49% of the resources, objects, and information managed and recognized by the Foundation have been altered to SCP-7000-A. Due to the diversity of the scope of its influence, its impact is not limited to this universe, but is widespread across multiple dimensions, creating an ongoing Z7K-Class Reality Chaos Scenario. It is believed that this outbreak originated in the 2010s or later, but the details are under separate investigation.

Among the concepts designated SCP-7000-A, the most severely affected and triggers the cascading destabilization of other concepts is the concept of &#34;branch&#34;.

SCP-7000 was discovered on 2022/06/25 by Ushu Kei, a staff member of the Foundation Records and Information Security Administration (RAISA), during a security check and update in SCP-2000, when a number of related files affected by SCP-7000 were confirmed. 
The Containment team cited the following three reasons for Ushu Kei&#39;s discovery of SCP-7000.

* Former staff of the Japanese Branch. (Could be SCP-7000-A.)
* Currently affiliated with the U.S. Headquarters site. (The non-SCP-7000-A portion of the foundation is in a recognizable state.)
* Was a RAISA staff member who came in contact with various files in the course of his duties. (Increased possibility to find files affected by SCP-7000-A.)
* Has a security clearance. (Same to above.)

Persons with these or similar conditions are extremely rare among Foundation staff and are non-reproducible. It is speculated that this is why it has not been discovered to date.

See previous revision for subsequent details.

After the disappearance, Dr. Mothei invited the Pataphysics Department based on Ushu Kei&#39;s testimonies, and the cause was rapidly clarified, and on 2022/08/04, the cause of the SCP-7000 was found as above. In order to neutralize the effect of SCP-7000 on our narrative layer as much as possible, an upgrade of A-Z7K.aic and the development of the Ushu Narrative Anchor (UNA) based on the Ushu Observation Device were conducted.

The UNA is based on specific influence patterns in the SCP-7000-influenced area, and aims to generate weak conceptual connections to areas that can be - and once were - affected by the same type of pattern, to the extent that they do not cause conceptual creep, and to stabilize the area through the connections. The improved A-Z7K.aic also includes this feature.

The following list contains examples of SCP-7000-A and related data from previous revisions.

If a person who has become SCP-7000-A or who has spent an extended period of time in the SCP-7000 affected area recognizes SCP-7000, the significant discrepancy between brain cognition and SCP-7000-based collective intelligence recognition will greatly confuse the person in question, resulting in further destabilization or disappearance of the being. The result is further destabilization or disappearance of the person in question. However, this phenomenon can be alleviated by explaining the cause or by weakening the influence of the SCP-7000. All Foundation staff members who had been suffering from confusion or severe destabilization of their existence, recovered and returned to their duties after this treatment with the exception of Ushu Kei.

__**Explanation from Dr. Mothei**__
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
Let&#39;s start with the obvious. The Foundation is working around the world to secure an anomalous presence. Of course, some of them are in non-English speaking countries. In such places, it is impossible to communicate with local people using only English, and it is also impossible to find anomalies. Therefore, it is necessary to have staff members who can speak the language of the country in each region, but it is inefficient to have staff members conduct language courses for each region every time. It is more convenient to hire local people as staff, and if you want to create an organization that can act independently to some extent, you do not have to worry about every detail. Thus, the foundation set up branches in each language area. (We basically don&#39;t operate on a country-by-country basis because we need to divide the system in vain. That is why Austria and Switzerland are under the jurisdiction of the German branch).
Now, as for the separate branches for each language, few people can speak more than one language, and the same is true of foundations. And even fewer are able to translate documents, since most of them are employed as interpreters. Therefore, most documents are left untranslated. However, English is often translated into other languages because it is relatively easy to learn. This is also due to the fact that it is an international language. However, this creates a problem.
While non-English speaking staff may have opportunities to read documents in their own language, there are very few opportunities for English speaking staff to read documents in other languages. Then, there is a big difference in the amount of document recognition here. For human beings, the size of the world they can see fluctuates depending on their beliefs and the amount of knowledge they have. Considering this, English-speaking staff members perceive the &#34;world&#34; narrower than staff members from other languages. And this difference in perception is compounded by the number of people belonging to each language group.
If this were all, SCP-7000 would not have occurred yet, but this problem occurs in the [[[sandrewswann-s-proposal|upper narrative layer as well]]]. This cognitive difference between the linguistic spheres affects the efficiency of the narrative modification process. The combination of these two, similarly structured factors is believed to have caused SCP-7000.

For years we overlooked this problem. As a result, the Foundation has failed to make effective use of resources that could have been used, and has largely put off problems that could have been addressed sooner. It is time to stop being driven by the gamble like the native language.

Now is the time to catch up.
[[/div]]

Coupled with the fact that [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-international several documents], primarily this one, have become the proofs of concept of existence belonging to international branches, the effect of SCP-7000 is rapidly weakening.
The SCP-7000 object class is currently being considered for change to Keter and is expected to be changed to Euclid or Safe in the future.

On 2022/08/29, Ushu Kei appeared at Site-17 with a flash of light. Although Ushu Kei did not retain any memories after 07/26, no space-time distortion due to SCP-7000 was confirmed. The individual in question has returned to duties, but it should be noted that Ushu still complains of occasional hallucinations.
The recording device that was missing at the time of the apparition was also recovered, and the following logs were recorded.

__**Video Log 7000-EE**__

**Ushu Kei:** Did I?

**Ushu Kei:** Just for that? My whole life has been for this?

**Ushu Kei:** Then set me free. I&#39;ve had enough of this.

**Ushu Kei:** What?

**Ushu Kei:** That&#39;s not much! Why, why!

**Ushu Kei:** Do I still have to suffer for you!

**Ushu Kei:** That&#39;s too much to ask! I have human rights to be protected! Now cut this off and let me--
