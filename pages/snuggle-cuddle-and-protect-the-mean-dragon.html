The following document was recovered by Agent ███████ following a vacation in ███████████, Florida:

&gt; **Document X45-a**
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;The Mean Dragon&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; There once was a dragon that made everyone mad,
&gt; He changed his shape just to make people sad!
&gt; He&#39;d be mean to everyone! Yes, even you!
&gt; Everyone called him six-eighty-two.
&gt; One day the big doctor had had enough,
&gt; &#34;You&#39;re mean and you&#39;re smelly,
&gt; I&#39;ll show you who&#39;s tough!&#34;
&gt; First he decided to use a big crystal
&gt; &#34;I&#39;ll freeze and then shatter him with my pistol!&#34;
&gt; The dragon&#39;s skin showed a quick aversion,
&gt; So it stopped at 62% conversion!
&gt; Then the big doctor thought, &#34;Hmm.. what to do...
&gt; I know I&#39;ll use good ol&#39; 162!&#34;
&gt; But the mean dragon was too clever for him,
&gt; And he attached the big ball to his left fore-limb!
&gt; He ran around the big halls and made a terrible mess,
&gt; Then he went back to his home under much distress.
&gt; The big doctor groaned and he moaned and he stomped,
&gt; When he suddenly saw a little agent prompt,
&gt; &#34;Sir, I know a way out of this pickle,
&gt; We&#39;ll just show the dragon the monster that tickles!&#34;
&gt; So they sent 999 to deal with their foe,
&gt; But 999 didn&#39;t want to go,
&gt; So they told it the dragon was being too mean,
&gt; And it went bravely onto the scene.
&gt; It jumped on the dragon, who let out a roar,
&gt; But he tickled and tickled and tickled some more,
&gt; Then, suddenly, the dragon was giggling,
&gt; But the monster just kept on jiggling and jiggling,
&gt; Finally the dragon pulled the monster off,
&gt; But he did not let out a roar or a scoff,
&gt; He said, &#34;Thank you, sir, you&#39;re a saviour hereafter,
&gt; Cause you have shown me the great gift of laughter.&#34;

Area hosting the document was firebombed. All recovered children who had been read the document were recruited into D-class.

Addendum (05-29-2011): Due to frequent requests for an audio form of this report, Research Assistant Corbette and Agent Mao have created a spoken version. Please see [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/snuggle-cuddle-and-protect-the-mean-dragon/the%20mean%20dragon.mp3 Audio Log X45-a].</textarea></pre>
