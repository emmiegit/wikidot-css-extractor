+ Howdy, I&#39;m Attila. Nice to meet ya.

I mostly just show up here whenever I have a new draft I want to push. Most of my works tend to fall into one of two categories: [[[scp-2801|high-concept]]] [[[scp-4943|sci-fi]]] or wacky [[[scp-5081|dark]]] [[[scp-5197|comedy]]].

[[tab Author&#39;s Notes]]
This is where I keep miscellaneous notes about my works. If you&#39;re looking to use one of my characters, or just want a peek behind the curtain, you&#39;re in the right place.

**SCPs:**
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ SCP-5197 - Department of Frontier Development&#34; hide=&#34;- Probably the closest thing I&#39;ll ever write to a political skip&#34;]]
+++ Where did the photo come from?
The base image of the monster on the hill came from [[*user Dr Whitney]]. [[*user DrAkimoto]] applied the static overlay to help hide the fact that it&#39;s a drawing. Thanks to both of them!

+++ What is a Gamma-class zone?
I&#39;ll probably change the name to something more memorable if I ever bring it up again, but a Gamma-class zone occurs when local spacetime becoming destabilized and is unable to converge to a stable state.

In case that was hard to understand, here&#39;s an analogy: imagine you are trying to sleep somewhere uncomfortable. You roll over onto your side, hoping that it will be comfortable enough to allow you to drift off. It isn&#39;t, so you roll over to the other side. That doesn&#39;t work either, so you return to your starting position. The cycle repeats from there. That&#39;s what spacetime is doing in a Gamma-class zone, to the detriment of everyone unlucky enough to be inside the zone.

+++ What is Ombre Rouge?
Ombre Rouge, LA is a callback to [[[SCP-3631]]]. The Chinese translator remarked in his forum post that he got confused when he couldn&#39;t find Ombre Rouge on a map. So when I needed a town to blow up in 5197, I chose to bring back Ombre Rouge.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ SCP-3631 - A Man and his Monster&#34; hide=&#34;- Why does every drawing of -1 makes him look like he has smallpox?&#34;]]
+++ What&#39;s the backstory for -1 and -2?
Simon (that is, SCP-3631-2) is a latent low-level reality bender. He created the monster (SCP-3631-1) as a child, who sort of served as an &#34;imaginary friend&#34;. The Foundation gets called in to contain it, and does. However, the car accident mentioned in the addendum causes Simon to lose his memory of the monster, causing it to disappear from existence. He lives life for a while, and the drawings found by his mother jumpstart his memory enough to bring the monster back. The monster, terrified of disappearing again, captures Simon and severs his limbs and vocal cords so he can&#39;t run away or call for help. The monster hopes that if it can replace his organs with childrens&#39; organs, he will become a child again and everything will go back to how it was.

I&#39;ll probably codify this in a tale at some point.

+++ What are -1&#39;s &#34;heat-sensing orifices?&#34;
They&#39;re [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_sensing_in_snakes|pit organs]]]!

+++ How has -2 survived this long?
Simon&#39;s own reality bending coupled with survival instinct make him exceptionally hardy. However, he&#39;s still not powerful enough to survive in his current state without outside help. -1, being a product of Simon&#39;s mind, is the best at providing said help (though a little of the Foundation&#39;s antiseptic certainly goes a long way).

+++ Is Ombre Rouge a real place? Where is it?
Ombre Rouge, Louisiana is not a real place. I wanted a name for a Louisiana town, and [[*user Ihp]] came up with it in #site19. I always thought of it as a small, blue-collar community near the swamps.

It gets blown up in [[[SCP-5197]]].
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ SCP-2801 - All Your Brains Are Belong To Us&#34; hide=&#34;- &#34;Hacking Brains for Fun and Profit&#34; would have been a better name, but too late now&#34;]]
+++ Who is Nathan &#34;Anark1&#34; Snyder?
Nathan is the hacker responsible for the creation of SCP-2801 and a newcomer to the world behind the Veil. He released SCP-2801 to throw the Foundation off his scent. This worked spectacularly; the Foundation is too preoccupied with groups like Pseudonym or Cohaz to make catching Nathan a high priority. Nathan is lying low for now, but doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s been inactive. He&#39;s not the kind to go down quietly.

Nathan is generally disinterested in other people, prone to boredom, and possesses little inclination to curb his morbid curiosities. Once something catches his interest, he pursues it voraciously. He is a meticulous planner, and has his hands in a lot more than the Foundation realizes.

If you&#39;re looking for an enigmatic hacker character, Nathan &#34;Anark1&#34; Snyder is a pretty safe bet.

+++ What happened to the Original Character Tournament tales?
I deleted them because they a) were posted before the rewrite, which drastically changed Nathan&#39;s characterization and prominence, and b) were bad.
[[/collapsible]]

**Tales:**
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Between the Zones&#34; hide=&#34;- Inspired by watching too many DEFCON talks&#34;]]
+++ What is Ravensgate Security Services?
A Group of Interest specializing in providing security services including penetration testing, consulting, and even stuff like forensics to other GoIs. They do business with the Foundation, Global Occult Coalition, Marshall Carter &amp; Dark Ltd., and any other GoI with an interest in preventing supernatural intruders. They work hard to maintain neutrality, a delicate balancing act which allows them to maintain their operations relatively unimpeded.

Ravensgate can be as large or small as you want. It can be just the team shown in BtZ plus 1-2 people handling the business side, or they can be large enough to have many different teams. None of this is set in stone yet.

+++ Who is David Keyes?
The leader of the team. Likes to lead from the front. Cautious and perceptive.

+++ Who is Kyle Locke?
The newest and youngest member of the team. Grew up in Three Portlands, more used to the anomalous than David. Somewhat rash and prone to rushing into things unprepared.

+++ Who is Doc?
The team&#39;s second-in-command. Tall and deathly pale. Usually takes the role of the &#34;man in the chair&#34;, providing resources and oversight from the rear while David leads from the front lines. Has an uncanny ability to absorb and regurgitate large amounts of information. He is tight-lipped about his personal history and adamant that he never be seen in public.

+++ Who is Xeno?
Xeno is the team&#39;s resident network pentester and equipment specialist fueled by an obsessive personality, energy drinks, and a love of terrible puns. She is a short latina who dyes the ends of her hair green.

Her real name is Angela Vasquez, but most people know her by her handle. Only her oldest friends would know her as Angela.

+++ Who is Susan?
Susan is a sapient dragonfly with a southern accent. She performs reconnaissance and other odd jobs suitable for someone of her stature. Well aware of her own fragility, she is determined to live her life to the fullest.

+++ Did you steal the plot twist from //Sneakers//?
Yes.
[[/collapsible]]

**GOI Formats:**
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ SPC-1810: ONYX TEMPEST&#34; hide=&#34;- Feathered Gods and Fisticuffs: A Pugilistic History of the Hawai&#39;ian Empire&#34;]]
+++ Is this based on real-world history?
I reused some names, and that&#39;s where the similarities end.
