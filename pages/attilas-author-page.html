+ Howdy, I&#39;m Attila. Nice to meet ya.

I&#39;m a college student from Texas majoring in  Computer Science. I mostly just show up here whenever I have a new draft I want to push.

My writing philosophy is that SCP articles should use the anomalous to explore interesting ideas, and that the nature of the anomaly should play a large role in its respective story. In terms of genre, most of my works tend to fall into one of two categories: [[[scp-2801|high-concept]]] [[[scp-4943|sci-fi]]] or wacky [[[scp-5081|dark]]] [[[scp-5197|comedy]]].

++ SCPs:
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ SCP-2801 - All Your Brains Are Belong To Us&#34; hide=&#34;- &#34;Hacking Brains for Fun and Profit&#34; would have been a better name, but too late now&#34;]]
Ah yes, my first SCP. This one had to be a record for the longest time it took to write an SCP article. It took //two years// to get this sucker to something that would survive on the mainlist, and another six months to rewrite it into something that could maintain a double-digit rating. And that&#39;s not even mentioning that I had been an active member of this site for //four years// before posting a successful article. Yes, I am bad at giving up.

Unlike most people&#39;s first SCPs, I am definitely proud of this one. It has easily my favorite concept of any skip I&#39;ve written. When I came up with it, I was starting to become interested in cyber security, and coincidentally the Mirai botnet was also wreaking havoc on the eastern seaboard. In an attempt to &#34;write what I know&#34;, I came up with &#34;botnets for people&#34;, which then evolved into &#34;malware for people&#34;. After the shocking realization that nobody had written that yet, I went with it. The original article was quite a bit different from it is now (there was a way-too-long and not-that-interesting backstory that took up most of the original; a relic of my Series III christening), but most of the current article is just me taking that idea and running with it as far as I can.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ SCP-3631 - A Man and his Monster&#34; hide=&#34;- Why does every drawing of -1 makes him look like he has smallpox?&#34;]]
You know the term &#34;sophomore slump&#34;? Yeah, that&#39;s this skip in a nutshell. 

Don&#39;t get me wrong, it did okay (albeit as the lowest-rated surviving Cliche Con entry), but looking back on it now... hoo boy. When ClicheCon rolled around, I knew I wanted to do a &#34;spooky scary murder monster&#34;. I&#39;ve always had a soft spot for monster skips. There&#39;s something of a stigma around them now, since so many new authors do them badly, and because the offsite community tends to laser-focus on them, but I still enjoy them and want to see them done well. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think I stuck the landing. The backstory wasn&#39;t //bad// per se, but I didn&#39;t flesh it out as much as I probably should have, and it has enough moving parts that trying to keep the article short worked against it. 

If you saw my edit to the author post, then you know that I regret ever explaining the story. When I wrote this article, I had been watching too many videos on Dark Souls&#39; storytelling style (a game I&#39;ve never played, go figure), and wanted to see if I could replicate that style and get people theorizing. I hadn&#39;t quite realized yet that nobody cares about the bottom 90% of skips enough to do that, and should have written something more straightforward. 

Anyways, here&#39;s the original backstory: Simon (that is, SCP-3631-2) is a latent low-level reality bender. He created the monster (SCP-3631-1) as a child, who sort of served as an &#34;imaginary friend&#34;. The Foundation gets called in to contain it, and does. However, the car accident mentioned in the addendum causes Simon to lose his memory of the monster, causing it to disappear from existence. He lives life for a while, and the drawings found by his mother jumpstart his memory enough to bring the monster back. The monster then captures Simon, hoping that if it can replace his organs with childrens&#39; organs, he will become a child again and everything will go back to how it was.

This one will probably get a rewrite once I finish some other ideas I have.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Between the Zones&#34; hide=&#34;- Susan doesn&#39;t have a backstory yet, please quit asking&#34;]]
If any of my friends that I named these characters after find this... hi. I&#39;m sorry I made one of you into a dragonfly.

The first two aren&#39;t on the site anymore, but this was the third tale I&#39;ve posted to the site. The first two were for PeppersGhost&#39;s Original Character Tournament. I deleted them because they were a) very bad, and b) starred pre-rewrite Nathan Snyder, the creator of SCP-2801 whose characterization and prominence in that article&#39;s story changed drastically in the rewrite.

The tale was primarily prose and character writing practice, since I am terrible at both. The story was mostly inspired by DeviantOllam&#39;s DEFCON talks on physical penetration testing, with some heavy inspiration from the movie Sneakers (which, if you&#39;ve been paying attention, you&#39;ll know that I borrowed the plot twist from). The characters are mostly just a five-man band applied to a pentesting team: David is the leader, Kyle is the lancer, Xeno is the smart guy, Doc is the big guy, and Susan... well, Susan doesn&#39;t really fit into anything, but I intended for her to be the heart.

This was meant to be a throwaway tale, but I&#39;ve really fallen in love with these characters. I don&#39;t expect Ravensgate Security to ever become a major GOI or anything - it&#39;s a very niche concept, and hard to grasp if you don&#39;t already know what a penetration test is - but I&#39;d love to revisit these characters in the future.
