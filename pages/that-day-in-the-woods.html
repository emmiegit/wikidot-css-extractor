Bright and beautiful.
Always the best days.
“Go play in the woods.”
“But be safe.”
My Grandpa would say. 

Down by the streams.
“Go catch me a fish.”
“Make it for dinner I will.”
My Grandpa insists.

Trees full of creatures.
A wonder to see.
It’s how I spent my time.
My Grandpa and me.

Living the dream.
The best it could be.
Until that fateful day.
I heard growls you see.

Grandpa came running.
With a large pointy stick.
Thrust through the beast he did.
It was rather quick.

Back to the cottage we went.
It wasn’t a long trip.
Scared and confused.
I made a bit of a fit.

Arrangements he made.
To my parents you see.
Grandpa insisted that.
They came and got me.

Back to the urban.
Only a matter of time.
Back with my parents.
Who wouldn’t give me a dime.

Grandpa said “It’s for the best.”
“Something I’ll get through.”
“See me next summer you will.”
“Don’t be that blue.”

A lie it was.
The last one I heard.
From my dear Grandpa.
Who died in the woods.

Or that&#39;s what they say.
The authorities did.
Believed it the truth.
They acted like kids.

Through fits and rage.
Part of me died.
Losing my Grandpa.
It hurt inside.

New goals I had.
I knew I must find.
Who is behind.
This horrible crime.

Years it took.
After my graduation.
I found who took him.
The SCP Foundation.

Hidden they were.
Far too powerful to beat.
Partners I needed.
It would be quite the feat.

An offer I got.
To complete my mission.
Signed up I needed to be.
