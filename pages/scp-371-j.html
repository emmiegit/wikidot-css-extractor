**Item #:** SCP-371-J

**Object Class:** Neutralized (Formerly Euclid)

**Special Containment Procedures:** N/A

**Description:** SCP-371-J is a single, shelled //Arachis hypogaea//[[footnote]] Peanut [[/footnote]] seed possessing cognitohazardous properties. When SCP-371-J is perceived by a human subject, they will begin laughing with varying intensity. The intensity at which laughter is induced is dependent on the amount of time a subject has spent working at a Foundation site, regardless of position or security clearance. Observed effects range from the spontaneous onset of pneumothorax[[footnote]] Collapsed lung [[/footnote]] on civilians to a moderate smile among various site directors. Subjects exposed to SCP-371-J will continue to laugh until they expire or SCP-371-J is removed from their vicinity. 

It is currently unknown why SCP-371-J&#39;s properties are related to the Foundation. Research into its creation, motives, and possible suspects responsible are currently under investigation.

**Discovery:** SCP-371-J was discovered following the death of 43 civilians in a Tokyo art exhibit, with all causes of death being attributed to a lack of oxygen. Foundation agents successfully located and contained SCP-371-J. Two personnel suffered injuries from falling after losing consciousness due to excessive laughter.

**Testing Log:** The following logs demonstrate the effects of SCP-371-J on various Foundation personnel.

&gt; **Personnel:** D-1221
&gt; **Time Employed by the Foundation:** 1 day
&gt; **Results:** Pneumothorax affecting the left lung. Subject expired before treatment could be administered.

&gt; **Personnel:** D-11424
&gt; **Time Employed by the Foundation:** 5 months
&gt; **Results:** Subject laughed uncontrollably until losing consciousness.

&gt; **Personnel:** Researcher Rex
&gt; **Time Employed by the Foundation:** 1 year
&gt; **Results:** Laughed uncontrollably until SCP-371-J was removed from his presence. Subject suffered a minor headache and abdominal pain caused by lack of oxygen and laughter respectively. 

&gt; **Personnel:** Dr. Everwood
&gt; **Time Employed by the Foundation:** 6 years
&gt; **Results:**  Subject laughed moderately. No negative side effects were found.

&gt; **Personnel:** Dr. Walters
&gt; **Time Employed by the Foundation:** 16 years
&gt; **Results:** Subject laughed briefly upon initial exposure before becoming silent again.

&gt; **Personnel:** Dr. Gears
&gt; **Time Employed by the Foundation:** 28 years
&gt; **Results:** Subject verbally expressed mild annoyance at the presence of SCP-371-J at the start of the test and did not exhibit a noticeable change in attitude or expression throughout the duration.

&gt; **Personnel:** Janitor Worth
&gt; **Time Employed by the Foundation:** 59 years
&gt; **Results:** Subject destroyed SCP-371-J&#39;s shell and consumed its contents. Upon being questioned, subject replied [[[licensing-guide|&#34;Trust me, I am doing you a favor.&#34;]]] Following this event, SCP-371-J&#39;s anomalous properties did not manifest, and the anomaly was reclassified as Neutralized.
