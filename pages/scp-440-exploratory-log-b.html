**Exploration #440-B:** Large-Scale Wilderness Observation Dome (LSWOD), Site-██
**Explorers:** B-6335[[footnote]]D-6335 was &#39;promoted&#39; from the D-Class ranks on 10/2/████ by order of O5-█. A highly unorthodox decision; O5-█ cited D-6335&#39;s pre-incarceration history of hunting large game and repeated successes interacting with SCP-440 and its denizens made him vital to understanding and containing SCP-440. As the exact terms and scale of his promotion are currently under consideration, he has been given the interim title of &#39;Beta Class&#39;.[[/footnote]] (Lead), D-58243
**TOD:** 10/2/████

//On 9/30/████, subject D-24573 was lost during an excursion. His last communication was &#34;Gotcha!&#34;. B-6335 and D-58243 were sent into the LSWOD in order to determine the fate of D-24573. Following the signal from D-24573&#39;s suit, the two have made an uneventful trip so far.//

**B-6335:** Stay closer, boy. Something&#39;s different.

**D-58243:** Stop with that &#39;boy&#39; shit, Beta. None of those rocktopods[[footnote]]SCP-440-2, a species resembling a rocky cephalopod.[[/footnote]] around, and the air is clear.

**B-6335:** I&#39;ll stop calling you &#39;boy&#39; when you start paying attention. 440-2s are curious buggers. They don&#39;t attack, but they always follow us around. Watching. Only one reason you wouldn&#39;t see a rocktopod swarm following behind us: there&#39;s something out there that they don&#39;t want any part of. 

**D-58243:** Uh huh. I&#39;ve got ten bucks on that idiot Delta died trying to take a piss on a dustbug[[footnote]]SCP-440-1, a small bug-like creature.[[/footnote]] nest. //[Beeping noise]// Looks like he&#39;s behind that sandy current. C&#39;mon.

**B-6335:** Slow down, Delta. I don&#39;t like this. Look at the motion in that cloud. You ever see a sandflow[[footnote]]Specimens of SCP-440-1 live in hollowed-out floating rocks, chained to the floor via &#39;ladders&#39; of SCP-440-1. Colonies undulate consistently, collectively agitating the ambient SCP-440 into tight &#39;jetstreams&#39; of SCP-440.[[/footnote]] like that? Too damned fast, too wide. 

**D-58243:** //[scoffs]// No, but I don&#39;t give a shit. We find 24573&#39;s body, I get a pardon. That&#39;s the rules.

**B-6335:** No, the rule is you don&#39;t do a damned thing until I tell you, understood? //[scuffling sounds]//

**D-58243:** GET THE FUCK OFF ME! WHY THE FUCK SHOULD I LISTEN TO YOU, OLD MAN?

**B-6335:** //[sighs]// Because you might not have noticed it, but that sandflow is now completely surrounding us. //[To Foundation observer]// Command, are you picking this up?

**Dr. ██████:** Loud and clear. 

**B-6335:** These aren&#39;t rocktopods, [FIRST NAME REDACTED]. Whatever took that Delta, I believe it&#39;s now hunting me and the kid here.

**D-58243:** //[To himself]// Oh shit oh shit oh shit...

**B-6335:** //[To D-58243]// Quiet. //[To Foundation observer]// Command, I have no visual on what&#39;s causing this sandflow, but if I had to wager? It&#39;s circling us, agitating the ambient SCP-440 into a funnel. Ready-made ambush. //[chuckles]// No need to corner your prey, just surround it in sand that&#39;ll never fall down, and you&#39;ve cornered it yourself. Clever girls.. hey, where are you-

**D-58243:** //[panting loudly]// Fuck this! Fuck this! Fuck this! //[the sound of sand buffeting D-58243&#39;s suit, followed by a grinding noise, then sounds of D-58243 struggling, and then screaming]//

**B-6335:** //[breathing deeply, speaks quietly]// Command, I now have visual on what I believe killed Delta-24573. Three of them. Hope you don&#39;t mind if I don&#39;t save the kid. He just... it was just looking at him, and he //punched it//. Instinct. Stupid kid. //[mutters &#39;stupid, stupid&#39;]//

**Dr. ██████:** Understood, Beta. Can you describe what you&#39;re seeing?

**B-6335:** Large suckers. Cylindrical. Two of them I&#39;d say are around maybe [1 meter] long, front to back. Third one is bigger. [2m] or so. Snakelike, their torsos look like [grunt] like the spine of a T-Rex skeleton, made out of stone. Interlocking, very fluid movement. The head //[sighs &#39;stupid kid&#39;]// the head looks like a standard floater[[footnote]]The informal term for the large rocks composed of coalesced SCP-440 that float aimlessly in the enclosure[[/footnote]] . Didn&#39;t get a really good look at the thing&#39;s mouth before the kid punched it, but it reminded me of a wood chipper intake. //[takes deep breath]// The little ones are playing with the kid now, big one is just watching. If I had to guess, I&#39;m looking at an Alpha creature with two immature specimens. Training to hunt, maybe? I don&#39;t think I can- oh fuck me.

**Dr. ██████:** Beta? Report!

**B-6335:** //[breaths deeply]// Big one decided to swim over to me, Command. Maybe an arm&#39;s length away. Mouth is definitely like a wood chipper intake. No eyes that I can see. //[awed]// It&#39;s amazing how fluid this cutie is, it&#39;s completely silent except for when it spins up its &#39;teeth&#39;. I guess that&#39;s how it vocalizes. Sir, I... I don&#39;t think these beauties are actively hostile, sir. The kid switched from Flight to Fight... guess one of the little ones did too. //[chuckles]// Can&#39;t really blame them, I- //[sound of struggling]// oof! //[sound of crashing]//

**Dr. ██████:** Beta? 

**B-6335:** //[chuckles]// I&#39;m fine. Big guy just knocked me a ways back with his tail. Guess I was //[pause]// Oh, well, would you look at that. Found what&#39;s left of Delta-24573, sir. //[whistles]// If I had to guess, the big rock snake wanted me over there, and I wasn&#39;t moving.

**Dr. ██████:** What&#39;s his condition?

**B-6335:** Dead. Helmet broke, must have choked on the 440 floating around. No damage to his body, though. Suit is all fucked up. The corpse is hunched over something, I&#39;m going to slide the body- //[whispers]// Oh, you idiot. You are a goddamned idiot. They sent you here to observe, not //violate//...

**Dr. ██████:** What did you find?

**B-6335:** It looks like Delta-24573 was holding onto a tiny version of one of those snakes. Bastard must have thought the parents wouldn&#39;t have cared if he tried to take one. Fucking idiot. The groups, the hunting... these snakes are pack animals, Command. Did the Foundation authorize this?

**Dr. ██████:** Sorry, Beta. You&#39;re not staff yet. Off the record, though? I doubt it.[[footnote]]At no time did the Foundation authorize the capture of any SCP-440-3. It was not until this exploration that the species were known to the Foundation.[[/footnote]].

**B-6335:** Whatever. Are we done here? I don&#39;t think the snakes&#39;ll attack again, but I don&#39;t want to be in their nesting areas anymore, if that&#39;s alright with you. I&#39;ve got no interest in reinforcing the idea to these lovelies that us apes are threats... any more than we already have, that is.
...

//B-6335 was allowed permission to leave, and reported being observed but unmolested by four instances of SCP-440-3. 5m from the airlock, he discovered the corpse of D-58243, who had tried to crawl away. As per standard procedure, both B-6335 and D-58243 were stripped and decontaminated of all [[[SCP-440]]] grains.//
