i was too young.
my mind
was a flailing child
unable to ask
why it was crying.
i was a thorny rosebush
blowing in the wind,
a hedgehog
trying to give cuddles.

i will never forget
how you made me feel:
like a violet
wilting in the winter,
like a tornado
barreling towards a house,
like a river
crashing into a dam.
i could never
shake your hand
or look you in the eye.

but my vision is clearer,
and i see now that
you and i came from
the same family of vine,
only you were given
water and sunlight
while i was starved.
how can a kudzu
be blamed for
people allowing it
to grow and suffocate
the forest?

it&#39;s hard to put out a fire,
but someday i think i will
be watching my cat roll
around in my backyard
and i&#39;ll think about how
bruised and lost you made
me feel, and my next deep
breath won&#39;t be any less
perfect.

i don&#39;t hate you.
go fuck yourself.</textarea></pre>
