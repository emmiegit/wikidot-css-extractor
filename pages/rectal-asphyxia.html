&gt; Clef&#39;s Diary
&gt; June 10th
&gt; Kondraki has died again. For the fourth time this month. When the pain exceeds a certain threshold, it will present unexpected pleasure to the human brain would tend to burn out directly as it cannot carry that much.
&gt; 
&gt; June 11th
&gt; Kondraki came to me, happy, we decided to play a little more carefully this time.
&gt; 
&gt; June 12th
&gt; Kondraki has died again. For the fifth time this month. The high-temperature iron ball would stick to the cooked meat before it goes deep. It also failed today.
&gt; 
&gt; June 13th
&gt; The supervisor scolded us again. It does seem possible that over-indulgence is having a non-negligible effect on the quality of my work, I decided to try abstinence from today.

The sun was shining, but there was rain. Accumulated rainwater steamed up from the ground. Clef, stood with a black umbrella, feeling himself like a ruffled glutinous chicken. A few people were standing aside in a pit. A coffin was placed in it, and a line was written on the front stone plate: Kondraki^^9^^&#39;s tomb.

&#34;Well,&#34; one of his colleagues done crying for he was too tired, leaned close to Clef, &#34;Tile head, could you please tell me in which way did our greatest king of Booooterflies die?&#34;

&#34;The autopsy report indicates that Kondraki died from fatal asphyxiation caused by something choking him around his neck.&#34; Clef looked at him, his gaze wandering from the bridge of his nose to the knot of his bulging throat, which squirmed a little before quickly receding backward in his line of sight.

Clef&#39;s eyes lingered on his crotch for a few seconds and then moved away in disappointment.

&#34;What the fuck do you mean by smacking your tongue?&#34;

&#34;Nothing. Just don&#39;t want to tell you about that.&#34;

&#34;Why? No matter how wild you played, you would always come with enthusiasm and share the exact detailed process of playing, wouldn&#39;t you?&#34;

Clef didn&#39;t reply to his words, his eyes drifted to the back of another colleague, following the curve from the neck all the way down. While putting his focus of the eye on the plump buttocks, Clef imperceptibly shuddered, then turned his head to distant mountains.

&#34;So, in which way did you play this time?&#34;

Clef choked for a second. He saw the thing in the corner of the room full of Rosseau&#39;s primitivism: the upper part consisted of his lover, completely naked, his body shaking like a sieve, curled up. The pink horribly shaped thing deep in his posterior, stirring out the warm bubbling filthy liquid, feces, and blood to underneath the body, with sheets made up the lower part.

The carry bag slipped from his hand, causing the erotic items scattered all over the floor.

&#34;Why did you start-&#34;

&#34;I can&#39;t feel it, Clef.&#34; Clef was interrupted by Kondraki who said with a sobbing voice. &#34;I tried many ways, including enema, electric shock, using fire, deepthroating - none of these worked. Clef, this body does not feel.&#34;

Clef looked at the sobbing lover with filth full on his body. He threw away a bag of erotic toys, then hugged his lover. &#34;Oh my dear don&#39;t worry about it, things like this could happen, I think we don&#39;t have to be too tangled up in the problem of assholes, I&#39;ve heard there was someone who had developed 15 holes on our body except ears eyes mouth and nose in an oriental ancient country I think we can also-&#34;

&#34;**There is NO FEEL!**&#34; Kondraki cried once again. &#34;I can&#39;t feel anything no matter where it is used on my body I&#39;m fucking **unfeelable**-&#34; The rosy-red electric dildo was wailed onto Clef&#39;s face and generously shared the filth on it with his face and hair. &#34;Ok let&#39;s not cry for now my dear, I think there&#39;s an easy solution to the problem, wanna know it?&#34;

Many years later, when the doctor confronted Clef, he still remembered the call he picked up that afternoon and what he faced when he arrived at Clef&#39;s room. Although the doctor has been immersed in his field for many years, obtained extraordinary clinic experience and mental toughness, when he took a glimpse of the scenery located in Clef&#39;s room, it was as if he was dragged back to that moment of panic when he was doing his first clinic visit, when that miserable patient&#39;s unrestrained sphincter spewed the contents of his intestines wantonly over his teacher and his bodies, creating a modernist painting.

&#34;I&#39;ve been working as a doctor for many years&#34; Later, at a party, through the anesthesia of nicotine borrowed from three cartons of cigarettes, the doctor found the courage to share the unpleasant memory. &#34;I was motivated to pursue medicine at the age of eight and entered the best medical university in the country at the age of eighteen, working my way up to a Ph. D., before entering the foundation and after graduating from my university, I worked at multiple public and private hospitals - as a goddamned anorectologist - I&#39;ve been exposed to countless cases. Of course, most of the time, these patients have all the feeling of shame that ordinary people have, and those illnesses are also basically still within the range - but some people.&#34; He said with a hard puff. &#34;I know lots of people - especially young people - have the most primal human desire to explore the posterior. As a doctor, you will know that even men who stimulate the prostate can get continuous high-intensity pleasure and even orgasm, but you //do// not understand their lust - I don&#39;t want to say it euphemistically - the lust of stuffing stuff into their assholes. I mean, I can understand the behavior of stuffing genitals into bottles, and I can also understand the behavior of getting pleasure by stimulating the prostate with a foreign object, as the saying goes, people have three major desires - but I can&#39;t really understand the stuff which they choose to stuff in.&#34; The cigarette ran out, so he lit up another one &#34;They give me the feeling like -like the behavior of children who pick up anything and shove it in their mouths. They don&#39;t even have the slightest, uh, compassion for their assholes. Without any exaggeration, I can say that all the things I&#39;ve taken out of different assholes over the years can- Well, I mean- open a grocery store with stacks fully stuffed.&#34;

&gt; Clef&#39;s Diary
&gt; June 14th
&gt; First day of abstinence.
&gt; 
&gt; June 15th
&gt; Second day of abstinence.
&gt; 
&gt; June 16th
&gt; Kondraki came to me.
&gt; 
&gt; June 17th
&gt; First day of abstinence.
&gt; 
&gt; June 18th
&gt; Kondraki came to me.
&gt; 
&gt; June 19th
&gt; First day of abstinence.

With a scream, a mixture of milk, lubrication and
the bowel fluid spurted out of Clef&#39;s anus and onto the carpet, and Kondraki looked at his lover, who was convulsing on the bed, and leaned down to kiss him with his eyes transfixed. &#34;Oh my dear, you broke the record again, I have to admit that you are more skilled at spurting than I do. I think maybe we can try to switch our roles often - of course, I&#39;ll be more careful not to break you than when you use me. Clef did not respond, wet with sweat and mucus, he breathed deeply, like a fish that had been thrown ashore, it&#39;s just that the red flush and wet eyes don&#39;t seem to be related to the death struggle no matter in any aspect Kondraki looked at his continuously constricted anus and remembered that his father had given him a black bass when he was 10 years old, it&#39;s a type of fish that doesn&#39;t have teeth, and a distinctive fishy aroma from the mucus secreted on the surface of the freshwater fish. Like any kid clueless about sex organs would do, he used that black bass, In more than one sense. RIP fish. He thought that in his mind.

&#34;Do you know, my dear?&#34; He said to Clef in heat, &#34;I always think that there are similarities between human posterior and fish mouth. Whether it is the rhythm of contraction, temperature, or touch, using the anus is not quite different from using the fish mouth - I think the only difference is that fishes will not scream to ask me fuck it.&#34;

&#34;Do you - urf - have to make me - ooh - feel the same way?&#34;

&#39;I just want to feel the differences.&#34; Kondraki pulled his hand out of Clef&#39;s rectum - which brought the latter to another orgasm - then took off his glove and shoved it into Clef&#39;s mouth &#34;Sadly, no matter how I experience it by myself, I can&#39;t imagine what is it like for fishes to think about doing sex - there is an old saying in ancient China, what is it - is it //&#34;You are not a fish, then how do you the joy of it?&#34;// Clef doesn&#39;t know much about Chinese culture, and being stuffed in the mouth with his own mixture of intestinal fluids, milk, and whatever else, he probably couldn&#39;t think about anything other than sex either, not to mention the fact that Kondraki was constantly changing the object to a bigger size in his posterior.

&#34;I often wonder what thing that fish saw inside my body. All these years of thinking still couldn&#39;t abate the curiosity in my heart, and even the endoscope could not satisfy my thirst for the unknown-&#34;

&#34;I must see it with my own eyes.&#34;

&#34;You know, intestinal fluid is actually sweet.&#34;

&#34;What?&#34;

&#34;No, it&#39;s nothing.&#34;Clef waved his hand and lit himself a cigarette. &#34;Don&#39;t you guys always complain that I share too often? So why are you getting so energetic about my lovely experience this time?&#34;

&#34;No, actually not so energetic. And you usually share it more than frequently, not only more often, but also very detailed, maybe I should say a little too over-detailed, and serval buddies in the same office as me couldn&#39;t understand that he reassigned. The colleague waved his hand as if he is repelling flies, &#34;But I feel that I can&#39;t adapt to it that you suddenly stop speaking as I listen from time to time, well, what happened this time You finally did play for too much? No, in which way can you do too much? I remembered once you guys play, causing Body Disposal Department all came over and complained to me about they were more willing to deal with anomalies.&#34;

&#34;Is it possible that this time you are the one being played?&#34;

Clef stiffened for a moment.

&#34;I don&#39;t want to sound impolite - but with the level of fever you two have for the development of human posterior, you&#39;re still an undeveloped, er, what should I call it, chaste body?&#34;

Clef turned his gaze to distant mountains. colleague whistled loudly behind him.

&#34;You can&#39;t imagine those things - things like dildo, buttplug is more than ordinary. Some people come e stuff glass production, into their asses, and when they come to do the diagnosis, they feel that their intestine will die if the sphincter is pushed harder, There are even people who stuff live things into them, I didn&#39;t know it until my finger was caught in a pincer of a crawfish during the anal examination; I have also seen people who stuff light bulb in their asses - I don&#39;t understand how you can put that kind of huge-as-hell things through the anus, all the way to the rectum - until last time I saw someone shove
a barricade up their ass.&#34;The doctor took a deep, indignant puff on his cigarette, the smoke coming out of his nose and mouth together.

&#34;I&#39;ve seen more since I came to the foundation - It&#39;s a fucking gift to me to have some clerks come to me to see hemorrhoids and such, those men who are young and energetic do nothing but to think about putting a variety of strange things, last time, there was some of bitch stuffed a standard rifle into his rectum, and it fucking went off, when he was sent over, the scene was simply unwatchable. After being reassigned to here, I thought I could finally have some peace for a while, and then I met Clef and Kondraki, those two motherfuckers. These two fuckers are literally the most fanatical guys I&#39;ve seen in developing intestinal in all my years, and they&#39;ve done everything you can imagine that can&#39;t be done to the human posterior. The great spirit of exploration is unrelentingly ventilated on their assholes, at first I would be shocked at the perversity of their methods and the richness of their imagination but later I saw them for less, why? Because most of the time would depend on forensic that time.&#34;

The doctor viciously extinguished the cigarette and flicked it to the trash can in the comer.

The coroner once thought he had seen all the unsightly corpses in the world.

The coroner has been working in the Body Disposal Department for more than a decade and has handled corpses that could fill several foundation standard notebooks The number of times he went to the scene for autopsy in person has long been too many to count, and there are no short of situations that make him such an old coroner are amazed by After countless contacts with all kinds of corpses. forensic doctors have long been able to do that no matter What kind of death they see will not be moved by the point of view. Especially recently handled a lot of Kondrakis created from Clef and Kondraki&#39;s exaggerated experiments and play, the coroner feels that he has nearly exhausted the world&#39;s strange ways to die.

At least he used to think so.

On this day he was called, as, usual, to Clef&#39;s room to help dispose of the body. He thinks it&#39;s just routine aftercare; after all, Clef and Kondraki have long made a name for themselves in the Body Disposal Department for their sick play. On the way to Clef&#39;s room, he even wondered what new tricks would appear this time.

So he just pushed that door open.

How many steps does it take to stuff an elephant in the refrigerator? The answer is three steps. Open the refrigerator, stuff the elephant in it, and close the refrigerator.

The same is true for showing the head into the rectum.

The first step is to open the anus as wide as the head can be staved in. This step is usually accompanied by muscle tearing, of course, Clef couldn&#39;t make any comment about this since his mouth was being stuffed tightly by gloves stained with his intestinal fluid.

The second step is to shove the head in. Kondraki bathed his head in the lubricating fluid. He looked to Clef&#39;s posterior, dilated to the limit, in the faint light, the transverse rectal wall slicked with lubrication in t the soft flesh of milk and intestinal fluid stretching and contracting with Clef&#39;s breathing, making Kondraki think of one art exhibition he used to take part in and the famous //Nude Descending a Staircase//. He got down on his knees and put his face to Clef&#39;s posterior. The breath hit the external sphincter and Clef shuddered again, letting out an unexplained whimper. Kondraki savored the psychedelic scent from his gut, he looked deeper, as if he saw the fish of his childhood beckoning to him in a trance.

&#34;I&#39;m coming, baby.&#34;He murmured and began to squeeze inward The first structure he passed through was the anal pecten, &#39;this comb-like structure is used to smoothly export the filth 
out of the body, now it was subjected to an entry from the outside in, so it cracked in protest, blood hit Kondraki&#39;s nose Then he passed the te and the anal
valvulae anales anal sinuses columns
These three brothers ended up similar to the anal pecten. These structures were never meant to be under such pressure in many years of natural selection and evolution, but today they are chopped apart like a crustal movement in a man&#39;s pursuit of the black bass he shared his childhood with.

Kondraki went deeper. With the last bit of light, he saw tiny tubes swelling open. Rectalplex venous plexus, He thought.

Kondraki went deeper. The light completely faded away. All that could be felt was the squeezing of his head from all sides, and the gas in Clef&#39;s intestines brought him close to ecstasy. //You&#39;re not me, how do you know whether I knew the joy of fishes?// Dreamily, Kondraki left divine tears inside Clef&#39;s body. In this moment of eternity, he caught the black bass in torrent and mingled with him.

It takes three steps to stuff an elephant into the refrigerator. Open the refrigerator, stuff the elephant in it, and close the refrigerator.

Kondraki overlooked a problem. That is, needing to pull the head out after shoving it into the rectum.

The Intestines evolved without any consideration that someone would need to breathe in them. The place that had haunted him was now a deadly trap.

Kondraki finally realized the problem when the choking sensation spread throughout his body. So he struggled to pull his head out.

How many steps does it take to stuff a giraffe into a refrigerator? The answer is four steps. Open the refrigerator take the elephant out, stuff the giraffe in and close the refrigerator.

But the door of the refrigerator does not contract.

When Clef finally regained consciousness from the great pain and satisfaction, the violent sense of contractions in his posterior made him realize what kind of a situation his lover was in. So he was immediately struck down by great fear.

**&#34;Fuck you fuck you get the fuck out Kondraki don&#39;t die in my fucking asshole!!!&#34;**

These were the last word heard from afar before Kondraki saw the fish.

The coroner&#39;s father had a considerable degree of love for art. The coroner has been led by his father to visit various art exhibitions since his childhood.

He once stopped for a long time in front of Gustav&#39;s paintings and was captivated by the wild and unrestrained creations, The freedom and emotions symbolized by the naked people in the painting were engraved in his childhood. He had avidly pursued Gustav&#39;s art, not only by creating it himself but also by trying to restore the impact with existing objects, but the results were invariably a failure.

The moment he saw Clef and Kondraki and the prospect they had created, the coroner felt like going back to that afternoon when he first saw //The Virgin//, the colorful entwined naked human bodies reflected in his gaze, the heavy colors and wild compositions that are characteristic, of symbolism were striking his brain, he felt his soul being called by Gustav.

When his thoughts returned to reality, his professionalism told him there was another person on the scene who was about to lose excessive blood and needed to be resuscitated. So he dialed the doctor&#39;s number.

No one knows how they pulled Kondraki out of Clef&#39;s anus. yet no one knows how the doctor cured Clef&#39;s ass in the end. It was only later that it was found that the coroner and the doctor. were often appeared together in the bars of the site. Later, someone once heard words the coroner said:
