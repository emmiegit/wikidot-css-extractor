**Exploration #440-A:** Animal Enclosure #42 
**Explorer:** D-23467
**TOD:** 6/7/████

//Due to an increase in airborne [[[SCP-440]]] concentrations preventing external viewing, D-23467 was sent into AE#42. D-23467 is equipped with a standard Foundation NBC suit with respirator, a flashlight, and a cannister of compressed air.//

**Airlock Voice:** {{Outside environment doors locked. Enclosure Door open. You may now enter the Enclosure. Have a safe and pleasant day.}}

**D-23467:** Command? Can you hear me?

**Dr. █████████:** Loud and clear, Delta. What can you see from the airlock?

**D-23467:** Um, not much, Command. The doors opening kicked up a bunch of this floating sand stuff. //[sounds of compressed air firing]// Booyah. Command, I see a bunch of rocks floating around. Lots of sand blowing around. None of the rocks are close, though.

**Dr. █████████:** Enter the Enclosure, Delta. Report what you see.

**D-23467:** Sure enough, Command. It&#39;s not that... oh, jesus!

**Dr. █████████:** Report, Delta!

**D-23467:** Oh, sorry, nothing serious. I have to //[grunts]// walk very slowly and carefully. I guess a lot of this floaty stuff eventually lands on the sand, cuz every step I take kicks it up. I have to, I dunno, goose-step to make sure I&#39;m not kicking up plumes of this crap behind me. //[pause]// You sure this place is safe, Command?

**Dr. █████████:** Completely safe, Delta. Proceed at will. We&#39;ve seen some stationary objects a few meters in front of you. We&#39;d like you to examine them for us.

**D-23467:** Very well, Command. //[grunting continues]// Do you guys pump air into here from vents or something?

**Dr. █████████:** No, Delta. Why do you ask?

**D-23467:** Well, this stuff floats around, right? There&#39;s currents of this stuff, Command, like little floating rivers. It&#39;s sort of pretty, but wouldn&#39;t it just sorta... I dunno, disperse like clouds or something? 

**Dr. █████████:** Unknown. Have you seen any stationary objects?

**D-23467:** //[faint scratching noise]//-rry, was walking through one of the rivers. Felt like walking through a really slow sandblaster. //[pause]// Oh yeah, I found it. Man... that&#39;s //weird//.

**Dr. █████████:** Report.

**D-23467:** It&#39;s.. it&#39;s like one of those big termite mounds you see in the desert back home, floating in the air //[pause]// Command, this thing is chained to the ground with a thick string of sand. The, um, big rock is about [30cm] around, [45cm] wide. It&#39;s got those bug things [SCP-440-1] on it, scurrying around. It&#39;s like... it&#39;s spinning a bit, bobbing a little. //[pause]// I thought you said this stuff floats, Command, how the hell is it not floating?

**Dr. █████████:** That&#39;s why you&#39;re in there, Delta.

**D-23467:** //[groans]// You&#39;re the boss, Command. Gonna try and get to the end of the string

//D-23467 spends the next twenty minutes attempting to reach the base of the object. Because of the erratic motions of the object, D-23467 settles on lying prone and crawling towards the base. Because of the amount of SCP-440 this disturbs, this process required D-23467 to wait for 440 to disperse repeatedly.//

**D-23467:** Alright, finally. Oh, wow...

**Dr. █████████:** Report, Delta.

**D-23467:** I was wrong, Command. The rock isn&#39;t connected to the ground with sand, it&#39;s got a metric ███load of Dustbugs keeping the whole thing from floating away. There&#39;s a few dozen of them in the sand here, holding onto a few more, who are holding on to a few more. It&#39;s like those ants in the jungle that make bridges out of themselves for the rest of em. //[pause]// Oh, that&#39;s interesting... looks like the Bugs keep the big rock up top touching those sand currents. Maybe they eat- //[loud crash]// Jesus ████!

**Dr. █████████:** Delta! What happened!

**D-23467:** I think one of the floating rocks hit the bug-chain, Command. I can&#39;t see shit! All I&#39;m seeing is sand! Somethin&#39; shook this ████ing snow globe!  Get me out of here! Where is the  ████ing airlock?

**Dr. █████████:** Negative, Delta. Try and get your bearings and let the 440 around you clear. Report, Delta.

**D-23467:** //[breathing heavily]// I was looking at the chain of these bugs, Command, and out of nowhere a fist-size rock came out of nowhere and smacked into it in the middle. The bugs just pulverized, and then everything exploded. It didn&#39;t help that I got my white ass out of there in a hurry! //[nervous laughing]// Command, that wasn&#39;t one of those floating rocks, something //threw// it. What else do you have in this place?! You told me about these bug things, what else is here?

**Dr. █████████:** That&#39;s why you&#39;re in there, Delta. Can you see anything?

**D-23467:** //[bursts of compressed air]// Yeah, Command, a little bit. There&#39;s a cloud of... oh, Command, you got more than bugs in here, now. I see three, I don&#39;t know, rocky squid things. Looks like we&#39;ve found our chuckers. They have their tentacle things around the main dustbug rock. D-do I have to get closer? I can&#39;t see ████ from here, but...

**Dr. █████████:** Yes, Delta. Get as close as possible.

**D-23467:** I&#39;m the one who is seeing squids made out of sand, Command, so I&#39;m going to get as close as I ████ing feel like it.  //[grunts]// Looks like these squid things are breaking up the rock the Bugs lived in, Command. I&#39;m not stickin&#39; my hand near em, but my guess is they are eatin&#39; the thing. Sounds like a rock in one of those crusher things. Bugs look like they are trying to fight back, but it ain&#39;t working.  I&#39;m no scientist, but my guess is the squids do the rock-chucking thing surprise the Bugs long enough to do their job. //[pause]// Oh, Christ, Command... there&#39;s more of these things.

**Dr. █████████:** What things, Delta?

**D-23467:** Those rock-chain things, I didn&#39;t see them before, too much dust floating around. I guess these are dustbug hives or something. I can see at least six of these things in here, but I&#39;d have to walk more to get through some of the sand currents in here. I see a few more groups of rock squids too flying around. //[pause]// Christ, the squids are done with the Bugrock! //[gasps]// They see me, Command!  Permission to withdraw?

**Dr. █████████:** Negative, Delta. See what they want.

**D-23467:** Yeah, easy to say that, you asshole, you&#39;re not the one about to be- //[pause]// They are just... watching, using some of the rocks around me to circle around me. They don&#39;t have eyes, or at least ones that I can see. They look about [70cm] long all told. It&#39;s like someone made an octopus out of a rock, Command, but... how the hell is it so fluid? Rocks don&#39;t... rocks don&#39;t- //[cursing]// ████er just sprayed me with sand, Command, I can&#39;t see ████ right now. Squids do that ████ with ink, I guess these ████ing things do with sand. //[sounds of compressed air]// Oh thank God, they&#39;re gone now, Command. Permission to return to the airlock; I&#39;m running out of air in this thing, and I&#39;m not going to get caught in another duststorm without enough air.

//D-23467&#39;s return to the airlock was uneventful. As per standard procedure, D-23467 stripped inside the airlock and was decontaminated of all [[[SCP-440]]] grains and returned to D-Class dormitories.//</textarea></pre>
