------
**Special Containment Procedures:** A treaty with the South African government has been established giving the SCP Foundation complete access to any regional and national resources to be used as assets in the containment of SCP-7668. Furthermore, containment of SCP-7668 is controlled entirely by the SCP Foundation and the South African government has agreed to remain separated from the inner workings of SCP-7668s containment. Additionally, the South African president, Cyril Ramaposa along with its government has agreed to provide aid to the Foundation should it be requested. The treaty shall stand for the next ten (10) years with the treaty being renewed every decade. The treaty is scheduled for renewal in 2027.

Due to SCP-7668s popularity as a tourist destination, cutting it off from the public would create suspicion, thus containment is to be performed covertly. SCP-7668 is to be monitored by SCP Foundation orbital satellites for any signs of a potential containment breach; furthermore, a diamond mine located inside of SCP-7668-1 has been converted into a subterranean facility to house personnel assigned to SCP-7668s containment. The facility, designated Area-██ contains forty (40) research staff, thirty seven (37) security personnel, fifteen (15) class-0 personnel and twelve (12) members of Class-D. 

In the event that SCP-7668-2 awakens, demolition charges possessing an explosive yield of ██ tons of TNT placed throughout weak points in SCP-7668-1 are to be detonated and the surrounding area is to be cordoned off via the placement of a 50km exclusion zone around SCP-7668-1A. Should the demolition charges prove ineffective in destroying SCP-7668-2, all civilians within a 200km radius are to be evacuated and a twenty-five (25) kiloton plutonium based nuclear bomb is to be detonated, furthermore, members of MTF Nu-7 and Eta-5 are to be put on standby. In the event that the nuclear device is detonated, a cover story claiming that it was an accidental detonation caused by the crash of a military plane is to be released to the public. Amnestics are also to be provided to all civilians following their evacuation.

**Description:** SCP-7668 is comprised of two main anomalies, those being SCP-7668-1 and SCP-7668-2. SCP-7668-1 is a subterranean vault located three hundred and twelve (312) meters below an area of the Drakensburg mountain range located in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The area of the mountain range where SCP-7668-1 is located, designated SCP-7668-1A, is populated by roughly ████ individuals. The mountain range itself is part of a major topographical feature of Southern Africa known as the Great Escarpment. As mentioned, SCP-7668-1 is a large subterranean vault which can be accessed via three (3) cave entrances. (At some point in time, the number of entrances was twelve (12) though many of them have since collapsed) SCP-7668-1 is cylindrically shaped, with the floor and ceiling possessing a radius of 75m and the walls of the chamber measuring at exactly 250m in height. Attached to the chamber ceiling is a large, blue crystal which does not match any known element on the periodic table. Located at the center of the chamber is the aforementioned SCP-7668-2.

SCP-7668-2 is a massive, vaguely humanoid entity with an approximate height of roughly 45m and a weight of 3000 tons. SCP-7668-2 possesses four arms, blackened and charred skin, twelve eyes (Six eyes on each side of its face), bovine like legs similar to that of a centaur, a head crest comprised of ivory and a vaguely insectoid-like mouth. SCP-7668-2 is alive, though it appears to be in some sort of coma, with it producing very little brain activity and weak vital signs. SCP-7668-2 is believed to be thaumaturgical or even divine in nature, this is supported by various lines of Arabic text inscribed into the walls of SCP-7668-1A. This text is accompanied by runes and sigils of unknown meaning; the purpose of these sigils is also unknown, though it is possible that they play a role in keeping SCP-7668-2 incapacitated.

The Arabic text on the chamber walls provides a retelling of events that lead to the chamber&#39;s creation as well as SCP-7668-2&#39;s involvement in its construction. The text is believed to have been created around the 15th century CE, though an exact date is impossible to determine.

The Arabic text discovered in SCP-7668-1 has been divided into five (5) chapters. The accompanying sigils and runes still have yet to be translated.

**Chapter 1:** 
The arrival of the Prince was market with a ball of fire, descending from the heavens and forming a crater in its wake. From the smoldering ashes rose a great and terrible figure. He had many names, The Breaker of Kingdoms, The Horned Brute, Bane of angels, but to us, he was known as The Prince of Fire. He was a great and terrible demon, one who festered in the darkness beneath the trees, a specter of chaos and destruction. His desire for death was matched only by his loyalty to his master, The Crimson Kahn, lord of the darkness below.

The Prince, accompanied by his sword and spear, ravaged everything in his wake. Kingdom after kingdom, cities that had stood for a hundred years, all turned to dust beneath his hoof. As if his genocide was not enough, after bringing great ruin and death, he would steal treasures and trophies as tribute to the King, sacred artifacts stolen and condemned to spend eternity decorating the King&#39;s great halls.

The Prince&#39;s war had begun.

**Chapter 2:**
The Prince of Fire continued his campaign, word of his might spread across the land, both naked savage and educated noble alike received news of his coming, and all were powerless to stop it, though that did not fetter the bravery, or foolishness of those willing to fight back. One such was King Anesu, who ruled a great kingdom in the South. He, along with his finest warriors, ten thousand strong, met the Prince on the field of battle. King Anesu charged towards the Prince, his men hurling arrows at the beast and slicing at its legs, but no blade could lay its mark on the Prince&#39;s flesh and so, one by one, the kings men fell, leaving him all that was left. 

Amused by the battle, The Prince of Fire tore King Anesu&#39;s head from his shoulders, using his blade to clean it so that he could present his skull to his master. Once news of King Anesu&#39;s defeat reached the ears of his countrymen, they fled, leaving their great kingdom to ruins. The Prince of Fire took the ruins as his own home, adding further insult to the vanquished.

(Note: It is theorized that the author is referring to the kingdom of Great Zimbabwe which was abandoned in the 15th century CE, which is coincidentally, the same time that the above text was written.)

**Chapter 3:**
The news of King Anesu&#39; defeat eventually reached the ears of the king of Mali in the far North West. His court was filled with the pitter-patter of fear and dread. The King called upon his scholars and wise men but none could think of a way to vanquish The Prince of Fire, that is, until an unlikely ally arose. Several years prior, a caste of Magi known as The  Order of The Falling Leaves were ousted from Mali for they were feared for their sorcery and power, cursed to wander the land, some found home in Arabia, while others died with no heirs to replace them. Six of the exiled came forth, they were Zaahir, Fadl, Adalb&#39;a, Vene&#39;eru, Gartah, and Neph&#39;ial. They vowed to stop The Prince and reclaim their honor, no matter the price.

**Chapter 4:**
Under the guidance of their eldest, Zaahir, the six scholars set forth to the kingdom The Prince had made his own. Under the guise of mad hermits, they approached The Prince, offering tribute to him and his master. Six Magi, six gifts.
From Neph&#39;ial, The Prince revived an ivory cup that filled its volume with what ever beverage the holder desired. Gartah was next, and he gave a ring, carved from the tooth of the serpent Anantashesha. After him was Vene&#39;eru who gave a red and gold robe fit for a god. Then there came Adalb&#39;a, who preseted a saber with a hilt of purest diamond. Next was Fadl, whos gift was a slave who could take the shape of their viewers greatest lustful desire, fit to join the concubines of the Crimson Kahn. And lastly was Zaahir, who bestowed a magnificent chest of gold coins, crafted by the finest gold smiths of Alaggada.

Awed by the beauty of these gifts, The Prince of Fire, despite his lust for blood, chose to spare the Magi and make them his guests of honor. For two days and two nights, they dined and lodged with The Prince before leaving for their home in Mali. Unbeknownst to The Prince, the Magi were there to search for weakness, which they found. They learned that The Prince before them was not The Prince, but rather an effigy being controlled by the true Prince, still residing in the darkness bellow, and as such, did not need to be faltered by blade, but by trickery.


**Chapter 5:** 
Armed with their new knowledge, the Magi set a plan. They traveled to the one land that The Prince of Fire had not yet plundered in the deepest South. With their magic and the craftsmanship of the workers of Mali at their behest, they carved a tomb beneath a mountain, this very mountain that you now stand in. The chamber was filled with gold and jewels, perfect tribute for the Scarlet King. At the top was the greatest of all, a blue gem, the size of a war elephant and cut to pure perfection, embedded into the ceiling of the chamber. What seemed as a normal jewel was in reality a totem that when touched, would sever The Princes connection to his puppet, tearing him apart from this world once and for all.

The Magi, disguised as dark savages waited for The Princes arrival, they knelt before him, offering praise and worship to make him think that he was to them a divine god, then, to perhaps offer tribute to spare his violence, they lead him to treasure. Amused by this, The Prince spared them and followed, fully intent on gutting them once they served no use, but once he made his way to the chamber, he was struck with shock at what he saw, gold, emerald, ruby, ivory and riches that equaled the halls of the Brothers Death, but the most alluring was the jewel in the center. The Magi, still disguised as savages, pointed to the jewel before dancing and bowing. The Prince, without hesitation, touched the jewel, intent on tearing it from the tomb, as he did so, he shrieked in pain, for he rapidly lost control over his puppet body. Revealing themselves, the Magi casted their most powerful sorcery to hasten the process, and in minutes, The Prince of Fire, who had caused so much death was vanquished, for now at least.

If you are reading this, know that the jewel may never be removed, as doing so would waken The Prince. You cannot allow The Prince to wake, for it will bring death to us all.

**Discovery:** 
SCP-7668 was discovered by British explorer and author, Nathaniel Isaacs, known for his involvement in the exploration and settlement of various regions in southern Africa during the early 19th century. A letter written by Nathaniel Isaacs to the governor of a near by colony provides an account on the discovery.

&gt; This is an urgent letter to the governor of the [REDACTED] colony. I apologize for the informality of this letter, though it is rather necessary. A few weeks ago, I, along with several natives and hired men embarked on an expedition into the mountains in hopes of documenting new species of flora. 
&gt; @@@@
&gt; Our guide, a member of the San tribe proved rather wise in navigating the region, however there was one area he refused to take us, I would ask him why and he simply would not respond, not even in his native tongue. In the middle of the night, my curiosities got the better of me, and I along with three other men ventured to the area of the mountain that we had not been allowed to enter. During the expedition, we fell victim to a sudden storm and were forced to take shelter in a nearby cave. 
&gt; @@@@
&gt; While taking shelter, we decided to go deeper into the cave to conduct research, and what I found was so utterly fantastical that I doubt you will believe me. We discovered a secret vault in the cave center, inside of which was a great and terrible beast. Its skin looked like charred leather and it bore the legs of a centaur as if it came from Greek myth. Surrounding it was a vast haul of gold and silver, more majestic than anything I have ever had the privilege of laying my eyes upon. The others were fearful of the creature, yet it seemed asleep. 
&gt; @@@@
&gt; We left the cave, our spirits shaken by what we had seen, only to be met by our guide. He yelled frantically, asking if we had woken the beast in the cave. I demanded that he tell us what he knew but he remained silent, stating that we knew too much already. I beg of you to provide us with aid so that we may perhaps capture this beast and safely recover its treasure. I understand if you find our tale too difficult to believe, but I swear on the name of our lord that what we saw was real. You need only see it for yourself.

&gt; - Nathaniel Isaacs


The letter was discovered by an SCP Foundation agent who had been stationed at the [REDACTED] colony in 18██ and was subsequently sent by boat to an SCP Foundation facility in the United Kingdom. Nathaniel Isaacs was approached by Foundation operatives who requested he show them the location of SCP-7668. Following the discovery of SCP-7668, both Nathaniel Isaacs and the governor of the [REDACTED] colony were forced to remain silent on the matter. The treasures contained inside of SCP-7668-1 were all safely transported to the United Kingdom for analysis. Said items were placed in containment in Site-██, where they still stand as of the time of writing.</textarea></pre>
