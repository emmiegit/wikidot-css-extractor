**Special Containment Procedures:** Major shopping malls within a radius of 75 miles or less of any and all known previous locations, especially those with consistently high customer traffic, are to be clandestinely monitored for any indications of an SCP-6566 appearance; as are relevant local law enforcement reports and any potentially related web results. Should an instance of SCP-6566 be discovered, it is to be immediately closed off from civilian customer access. Specific measures may involve cordoning off the SCP-6566 instance by itself, the instance plus any nearby stores, entire sections of the host building, or a full temporary shutdown of the entire mall itself, ultimately depending on the particular circumstances around a given instance’s location and operation.

Eligible agents and staff from the Foundation Demonics Department with sufficient clearance are to be rotated through a pool of candidates to carry out daily visits to any known active SCP-6566 instance, with preference given to members of SCP-6566 research staff if any are eligible. [[footnote]]Repeat visits appear to be acceptable to a point, but instances of SCP-6566-1 and SCP-6566-3 have been observed to become incrementally more hostile or even violent with each subsequent visit of a recurring “customer”.[[/footnote]] Upon arrival, they are to craft and purchase an instance of SCP-6566-A, and subsequently secure the SCP-6566-A instance for proper banishment and destruction procedures to be carried out promptly by Demonics Department exorcists.

Similarly, all civilians known to have visited SCP-6566 and purchased their own SCP-6566-A instances for themselves or their children are to be debriefed and then amnesticized, with any and all SCP-6566-A instances confiscated and disposed of through the same procedures.
-----
**Description:** SCP-6566 refers to a series of anomalous novelty toy stores reminiscent of the popular and similarly named Build-A-Bear Workshop, operating under the variation “Build-A-Boar Workshop” instead. Such stores maintain logos and name displays directly derivative of that company’s own, but with subtle exceptions which vary from instance to instance. Examples have included the replacement of black eyes within the ursine head of the logo with larger, glowing red orbs; interior and exterior color schemes with a much higher prevalence of shades of red, orange, brown, and black; and small inanimate decorations resembling SCP-6566-A instances, made of largely the same materials but displayed in macabre configurations. 

SCP-6566-A refers to entities partially resembling stuffed animal toys that patrons of SCP-6566, usually small children, direct the creation of when visiting the stores. Though customers can build figures reminiscent of a number of different animal species (sometimes simultaneously), the most commonly referenced and most frequently depicted in-store are members of the //Sus// genus.[[footnote]]Commonly known as pigs and boars.[[/footnote]] Rather than fabric, cloth, and cotton common among superficially similar stores which offer customers a way to create their own customized stuffed animal, the materials available for customer use in crafting their own toys at SCP-6566 consist mainly of flesh, bone, and viscera. Biological samples retrieved from SCP-6566 instances invariably display even or close-to-even amounts of human and wild boar genetic material, with human DNA often aligning with DNA of various missing persons from around the nearby geographic area. 

The same three entities[[footnote]] Or at least, indistinguishable versions of the same three entities.[[/footnote]] have been observed to operate all SCP-6566 instances as their “employees”, even in the event that multiple SCP-6566 instances are operating over overlapping timeframes. Despite fully humanoid appearances, Foundation measurements invariably pick up moderate levels of Tartarean Resonance Energy consistent with Naraka-Class demonic entities.[[footnote]]Naraka-class entities are fully corporeal demons of middling power, one level above the more common Tartarean-class on the Carvalho Infernal Hierarchy Index.[[/footnote]] The three beings have been designated as instances of SCP-6566-1, SCP-6566-2, and SCP-6566-3, and give their own names as Lucy, Ferris, and King respectively. Any version of any of the three will invariably become extremely agitated when directly referred to by any names or terms other than their self-proclaimed names. Exact reactions vary by instance and incident, but repeated use of any other names or terms within earshot will usually result in casualties or, at minimum, extreme bodily injury to whoever uses a different name or term to refer to them directly (and often to any bystanders physically close to the intended victims). [[footnote]]Intention and comprehension appear to have little bearing; multiple occasions have been recorded in which an unwitting customer mishears a name and repeats it incorrectly, even when specifically done in the process of asking for a repeat of the name.[[/footnote]]

Despite this, the name tags worn by these entities have universally displayed only seemingly random and presently indecipherable glyphs and symbols in configurations unique to each instance, even between different SCP-6566 manifestations. Though superficially reminiscent of thaumaturgic and demonological glyphs and sigils, no actual anomalous properties have been observed from any version of the symbols seen on such tags. All attempts at interviews, negotiations, or any significant dialogue with SCP-6566-1, SCP-6566-2, and SCP-6566-3, other than conversation relating to the building or purchasing of SCP-6566-A instances, have invariably been met with extremely hostile non-compliance.

**Phenomenological Overview:** SCP-6566 instances will almost always appear between standard operating hours, usually in the middle of the night, and will most often take the place of previously-empty storefronts. Despite the suddenness of SCP-6566 appearances and the consistent lack of any record or documentation of their existence held by whatever property or establishment the instances occupy, local shoppers and staff alike will almost universally claim to vaguely remember it being present within its host structure for several weeks or months prior. This effect usually persists even after affected individuals are shown video and/or photographic evidence to the contrary if shown while the local instance is still active, but does not persist once that instance has de-manifested. What causes or initiates de-manifestation of a given instance of SCP-6566 is not yet well-understood. 

Additionally, in spite of the conventionally disturbing décor, materials, and products maintained within the store, SCP-6566 instances exhibit a secondary cognitohazardous effect which renders nearby human persons much less skeptical of and uncomfortable with such traditionally disturbing objects, events, and entities. A similar but stronger property is consistent among SCP-6566-A instances, wherein they are perceived by the vast majority of individuals who come into contact with them without either sufficient cognitohazardous resistance training or pharmaceutical enhancement as conventional stuffed animals, and are treated accordingly. 

The first known SCP-6566 instance was discovered in St. Louis, Missouri,[[footnote]]St. Louis, MO is also the location of the Build-a-Bear Workshop corporate headquarters, though the exact significance of this (if any) remains unclear.[[/footnote]] in December of 2016 following an investigation prompted by unusually violent behavior from several children at one particular school was flagged by an agent embedded in local law enforcement as potentially spurred by some sort of anomalous activity. Affected children were all observed to possess SCP-6566-A instances, and provided similar descriptions of SCP-6566 in response to inquiries as to where their SCP-6566-A instances originated. Though the amount of time each child had been in possession of their respective SCP-6566-A instances varied, at least two children were hospitalized from illnesses believed to originate from the unsanitary (but unrealized) habit of consistently carrying around, cuddling, and playing with decaying flesh and entrails.

SCP-6566 instances were subsequently observed appearing in nearby towns as well, with the area in which they might manifest growing at a steady pace. Currently, the area of effect encompasses much of the midwestern and south-central United States, as well as bordering regions of southern Canada. If not halted, then at the current rate of expansion, SCP-6566’s area of potential appearance will fully cover the entire planet by 20██.

On the evening of November 30, 2017, a resident of Kansas City, Missouri made the following post to an online form dedicated to the paranormal, where it was soon flagged by a Foundation web-crawler:

Hi everyone, I’m new to this site, also just even believing or caring about paranormal stuff at all tbh. I’m really at my wit’s end here though, and increasingly scared for my kids too. So, here goes nothing, I guess…

I think my kids have evil, possessed stuffed animals. They’ve been up to some rather… disturbing antics since they got &#39;em at build-a-bear workshop last week, and often blame the toys, saying the stuffed pigs ‘told them to do the bad things.’ Frankly I don’t want to even get into some of the stuff I’ve seen over the last few days, but suffice it to say, this is way more than a couple of 8yo kids acting out. They also know things they shouldn’t know, and I’m starting to actually believe them when they blame the dolls. 

Yet for all that, my kids refuse to part with them. I tried hiding one while my daughter was in the bath (not letting the pigs in for bath time was quite an argument, let me tell you), but she found it even though I put it on a shelf she shouldn’t come close to being able to see, let alone reach. She also said the pig told her I tried to take it away from her, and has been sulking and refusing to talk to me all day. Meanwhile, my son snuck a KNIFE into his primary school this morning and tried to use it on another student! Sure enough, he said it was the stuffed pig’s idea. 

I’ve even caught glimpses where, for the briefest moment, I see horrific and grotesque caricatures of their normal appearance. I think it might be their true form... Or maybe that I’m literally just losing my mind. Either way, I’m definitely at my wits end here, and extremely worried for my children. What can I do?

Subsequent investigation verified her claims, and the Phillips family was tracked down and interviewed in order to get more information. While Ron Phillips was out of town at the time, the decision was made to go ahead and conduct interviews with the rest of the household first, with the option to conduct a further interview with Ron Phillips if needed, and containment and amnesticization procedures separately, if necessary.

[[tab Interview with Stacy Phillips]]
**Interviewer:** Dr. Jerry Klaff, a psychologist and a specialist in both counseling and interviewing individuals who have suffered traumatic anomalous experiences.

**Interviewed:** Stacy Phillips

**Foreword:**  Stacy Phillips agreed to assist Foundation investigation under the cover story of a group of professional paranormal investigators. Extraneous or irrelevant dialogue has been removed for brevity.

-----
&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;

**Dr. Klaff:** So about your online post…

**Stacy:** Yes well, I know it sounds pretty kooky, but you haven’t seen what I’ve seen.

**Dr. Klaff:** I wouldn’t automatically assume that, Ms. Phillips, but let’s find out. To start with, can you tell me more about where the stuffed pigs came from originally? A Build-a-Bear workshop toy store, correct?

**Stacy:** Yes, at the mall downtown, I can never remember the exact name. Anyway, last week, my husband and I took our kids to it after we saw one had opened. It was for their birthday, both of theirs; they’re twins you see, and this seemed like something they’d both enjoy. 

**Dr. Klaff:** I can imagine why. So this new store--

**Stacy:** I dont think it was really one.

**Dr. Klaff:** Not a toy store?

**Stacy:** Yep, I even went back there afterwards and it wasn’t there anymore. It’s just an empty store space now.  What’s more, I asked an employee  one store over and they said there had never been a Build-a-Bear at that location, that I must be mistaken. I know that I wasn’t though.

**Dr. Klaff:** I see. What do you think it was, then?

**Stacy:** I don’t know what it was and I doubt I even want to know, at least beyond knowing whatever I need to to save my kids. You have to help them Doctor, yo–

**Dr. Klaff:** Don’t worry, Ms. Phillips, we will. I would like to speak with them a little later too, if that’s alright.

**Stacy:** Whatever you think will help, just save them from those… things.

**Dr. Klaff:** The stuffed pigs?

**Stacy:** That’s what they look like most of the time at least. 

**Dr. Klaff:** But you suspect they’re really something else. 

**Stacy:** They have to be, otherwise my kids wouldn’t be doing what they’ve been doing, it all started when they got those damned pigs. You know, the odd thing is, of all the animals they always have in those kinds of shops, both of my kids chose pigs of all things. Neither has ever shown interest in pigs, so I don’t know what to make of that, but it is odd. 

**Dr. Klaff:** What other options do you remember seeing, might I ask?

**Stacy:** (//pauses for a couple of seconds, appearing to think over the question.//) You know, I’m honestly not sure. I remember that the whole store felt… wrong. At first I put it off to the overactive imaginations of my kids rubbing off on me, but soon I had a pounding migraine and a deep sense of dread I couldn’t explain, but both of those went away as soon as we left the shop. Regardless, it was all I could do to stand up and at least look at my kids’ toys, I did not have the wherewithal to explore the store or anything.

**Dr. Klaff:** Totally understandable. What happened once you left the store? 

**Stacy:** Well, my head got better, I’ll tell you that, and the kids seemed real excited over their new stuffed piggies. But everything went downhill from there.

**Dr. Klaff:** Yes, as you outlined in your original post. Can you elaborate on some of your children’s recent misbehavior?

**Stacy:** That’s a nice way of putting it. They have both been acting out in ways I never would have expected from either of them. When I say acting out, by the way, I’m not talking about hissy fits or not eating their vegetables– I’m talking about stuff like repeatedly getting into fights at school, setting random fires, throwing rocks at the neighbors’ windows, stealing money out of purses, both mine and from strangers, and so on. Plus, it’s only getting worse and worse. This morning I found a blood trail outside and found both of my kids carving up a dead cat.

**Dr. Klaff:** Where did they get the cat?

**Stacy:** They said they found it in the road, but… but the pained screeching and mewling of what I had at the time assumed were a couple different cats fighting each other somewhere in the neighborhood less than thirty minutes prior makes me fear the worst. 
 
**Dr. Klaff:** Did they have those toys with them?

**Stacy:** Oh of course, they always do now. Now, I know it’s not necessarily that strange for kids their age to bring their stuffed animals everywhere, or talk to them like imaginary friends, but… it’s the WAY they talk to them and play with them that&#39;s really alarming me. 

**Dr. Klaff:** What do you mean?  

**Stacy:** The kids whisper to them a lot of the time, as if they’re conspiring or something, and their games and pretend sessions have taken on much more disturbing tones. Violent even. 

**Dr. Klaff:** Can you elaborate?

**Stacy:** I… I’d honestly really rather not, Doctor.

**Dr. Klaff:** …Ok, well we can come back to that if need be. How about your husband, does he share your concerns?

**Stacy:** (//Stacy loudly scoffs before answering.//) Beyond noticing that the kids “have been a little moodier lately” even while insisting to me that it&#39;s somehow not a big deal… I swear, it&#39;s like he’s under some kind of spell too. No, he largely does not share my concerns. 

**Dr. Klaff:** Interesting. 

**Stacy:** Look Doc, I know this might sound like a poor mom blinded by her love of her kids and imagining they can do no wrong, but I’m telling you, this is not all in my head. Something is going on here.

**Dr. Klaff:** I know Ms. Phillips, and we are trying to get to the bottom of it. In the meantime, is there anything else you’d like to add, or anything you can think of that could be helpful to us?

(//Stacy Phillips thinks for a few moments before answering.//)

**Stacy:** Actually, now that you mention it, I believe my husband filmed the whole trip. You’d have to ask him for it, he never actually sent it to me like I asked. He’s always forgetting things like that, no matter how many times I tell him– Oh never mind, it’s not important. 

**Dr. Klaff:** Well, I will definitely follow up on that, thank you. One more question for now, though, if you wouldn’t mind. You mentioned something in your post…

**Stacy:** (//Stacy shudders and pauses before speaking.//) Yes, for the briefest of moments, I’ve gotten a few glimpses at these rotten, depraved caricatures of the toys my angels love so much, reeking of death and decay and with those beady black eyes staring hatefully into my soul… or I don’t know, maybe I’m just projecting.

**Dr. Klaff:** Well, um, I suppose we’ll get to the bottom of it. Thank you again.

&lt;END LOG&gt;
-----
**Closing Statement:** In a subsequent examination, Stacy Phillips scored in the 98.4th percentile of the Cognitohazardous Resistance Index for individuals with no prior anti-cognitohazardous training, potentially explaining her partial resistance to SCP-6566’s perceptual effects.

[[tab Interview with Kara Phillips]]
**Interviewer:** Dr. Jerry Klaff

**Interviewed:** Kara Phillips

**Foreword:** Following the first interview with her mother, Kara was brought in for the next interview. Kara insisted on bringing her SCP-6566-A instance with her, and after internal consultation, it was agreed that it could be worthwhile to observe the interaction between the two in a controlled setting. Kara was thus allowed to bring her SCP-6566-A in on the condition that it would be confiscated if she did not answer all the questions asked of her and/or she became too distracted by it.
-----
&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;

**Dr. Klaff:** Hello, Kara, how are you feeling today?

**Kara:** Ok, I guess. Kinda bored, you were talking to Mommy for a loooong time.

**Dr. Klaff:** Well, we’ll try to keep this brief then, just need to ask a few quick questions.

//Kara nods silently//

**Dr. Klaff:** Good. Now, I know you wanted to be sure to bring your little buddy there, what was her name again?

**Kara:** (//smiling widely now//) Princess Polly! She’s a wise and beautiful princess traveling the world to learn new things and help her friends learn things too along the way.

**Dr. Klaff:** That’s very noble of her, I’m sure she’s lucky to have you as a friend. Where did you two meet?

**Kara:** At build-a-boar workshop. 

**Dr. Klaff:** Do you mean Build-a-BEAR workshop? 

**Kara:** No silly, does Polly look like a bear to you?

**Dr. Klaff:** …I suppose not. So that’s where you, uh, “met” Princess Polly? You didn’t build her like kids usually do at such stores?

**Kara:** Well I mean I guess I did build her body, but not HER. I just made something that she could use here, while she explores this world.

**Dr. Klaff:** Oh, so Princess Polly is from another world then?

**Kara:** Yep, she said she’s been to several. Has to learn a lot so she can be a good queen one day.

**Dr. Klaff:** Well, I guess that does make sense. What is her world like?

//Kara is no longer looking at Dr. Klaff, but instead stares intently at her SCP-6566-A instance.

**Dr. Klaff:** Kara?

**Dr. Klaff:** Kara, I asked you a question.

//Kara finally turns back to Dr. Klaff with a newfound look of suspicion.//

**Kara:** Princess Polly says I shouldn’t talk to you anymore, that you’re gonna try to take her away from me.

**Dr. Klaff:** What? No Kara, I just want to learn more about her, and about you! Can you please tell me more?

//Kara stares unblinkingly at Dr. Klaff without answering.//

**Dr. Klaff:** …Kara?

&lt;END LOG&gt;
-----
**Closing Statement:** Kara Phillips refused all further cooperation or conversation with Dr. Klaff, ignoring all offers and warnings of potential punishment, even confiscation of ‘Princess Polly’. The promised confiscation was successfully undertaken by Dr. Klaff, though he did suffer mild injuries from scratches and bites inflicted by Kara in the process.

[[tab Interview with Joshua Phillips]]
**Interviewer:** Dr. Jerry Klaff

**Interviewed:** Joshua Phillips

**Foreword:** Given the results of Kara’s interview, Joshua was separated from his SCP-6566-A instance for the interview, to extreme distress and hostility on his own part. After sufficient promises of its return and an offer of a chocolate milkshake during the interview, Joshua finally began to cooperate, though still somewhat begrudgingly.
-----
&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;

**Dr. Klaff:** Hello Joshua, how are you today? 

**Joshua:** It was better when I had Merlin.

**Dr. Klaff:** Merlin is the name of your stuffed animal, yes?

**Joshua:** He’s not JUST a stuffed animal, he’s also an ancient pig man and magical wizard.

**Dr. Klaff:** Yes, I gathered from the name and clothing that he’s a wizard. As for ‘ancient’, though… just how old is he?

**Joshua:** Five eons.

**Dr. Klaff:** Um, do you know what an ‘eon’ is Joshua?

**Joshua:** (//Joshua sips from his milkshakes before answering.//) No.

**Dr. Klaff:** Then– Never mind. Let me ask about school; how has school been going recently, in your opinion?

**Joshua:** Again, better now that I got Merlin.

**Dr. Klaff:** Really now? I heard you have been getting into fights at school.

**Joshua:** (//Joshua shrugs.//) Yeah, other kids sometimes pick on me. Merlin’s helped me with that though.

**Dr. Klaff:** How so? 

**Joshua:** He tells me what to say back to someone who tries to bully me, and how to fight back if what I say makes ‘em mad enough to try and punch me or something.

**Dr. Klaff:** I see, and does Merlin’s advice sometimes include the use of dangerous weapons? I heard you pulled a knife on another student yesterday.

**Joshua:** (//Joshua takes another sip from his milkshake.//) What can I say, sometimes you just have to cut a bitch. 

**Dr. Klaff:** Excuse me?

**Joshua:** I said it.

**Dr. Klaff:** Do you usually make a habit of using such inappropriate language, Joshua?

**Joshua:** //shrugging// I say what I want and I mean what I say. Why should grown-ups get all the fun words anyway?

**Dr. Klaff:** Joshua, that isn’t a ‘fun’ word, it’s a very mean one.

**Joshua:** Well I had fun saying it. Besides, words only have as much power as you give them.

**Dr. Klaff:** That’s… actually not a bad point Joshua, where’d you hear that?

**Joshua:** Merlin. He gives me lots of cool advice, tells me how the world really works and all.

**Dr. Klaff:** Oh really, do you have any examples?

//Joshua takes a long slurp of his milkshake as he appears to think over the question.//

**Joshua:** …Aaah. Ok, let’s see, ummmm… 

//Joshua takes another long sip of his milkshake.//

**Dr. Klaff:** (//sighing//) Josh, I ne–

**Joshua:** Oh! He told me that most people are only out for themselves, and that people usually only want to manipulate you or take what they want from you. 

**Dr. Klaff:** That’s v–

**Joshua:** He also told me that niceness is usually an act people use to hide their real feelings, that the best way to stay ahead is to push others back, aaaand oh, the meaning of “manipulate”. 
 
**Dr. Klaff:** Well. Hrm. Those are all very bleak ways to view things, don’t you think? 

**Joshua:** What does “bleak” mean?

**Dr. Klaff:** I mean… Joshua, that’s not actually how most people think and feel, and assuming that they do doesn’t justify you doing the same just because you expect it from others.

**Joshua:** Oh. Hmm, ok. (//Joshua sips from his milkshake.//) What does “justify” mean?

**Dr. Klaff:** Let’s try something else. Have you ever seen in cartoons where there’s a little angel on one side of the hero, telling him or her the right thing to do, while a little devil tells them to do something bad and naughty instead?

**Joshua:** Merlin says “right and wrong” and “nice and naughty”, as we kids are taught it, is just a big lie built to prop up the weak off the backs of the strong. 

**Dr. Klaff:** (//sighing//) I’m sure he did. What I’m saying, though is… Look, I know he’s your friend, but Merlin is kind of acting like the little devil from those cartoons, and maybe you shouldn’t listen to everything he says.

**Joshua:** He said you might say something like that. He also told me what to do if you did.

**Dr. Klaff:** Oh? And what did he– Woah!

//Dr. Klaff is interrupted by Joshua rushing at him with a pair of scissors pulled from the pocket of his cargo shorts. Dr. Klaff is able to subdue Joshua with no injury to the child, and only a few minor cuts to his own person.//

**Closing Statement:** Joshua Phillips did not cooperate or answer any further attempts at questioning, and instead began alternating between loud screeching and attempting to bite his caretakers or stab them with various nearby objects, until being temporarily reunited with his SCP-6566-A instance.

Ron Phillips returned to Kansas City the following morning, and the video mentioned by Stacy Phillips was discreetly taken from his phone after he refused to send a copy voluntarily. It is believed that Ron never actually reviewed the footage in the week since taking it, at least since de-manifestation of that SCP-6566 instance, given the nonchalance he demonstrated regarding the recent developments involving his children and their instances of SCP-6566-A, which would be unlikely had he viewed the footage. A video log of the recovered footage is available below:

**Individuals Present:** SCP-6566-1, SCP-6566-2, SCP-6566-3, local residents Ron and Stacy Phillips, and their two twin children Kara and Joshua, ages 8.

**Foreword:** The following footage was captured on cell phone video shot by Ron Phillips, recording the surprise visit for the birthday of her two children.

&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;

//The video begins with the Phillips family approaching the SCP-6566 instance. The children are both blindfolded and being led by their father.//

**Kara:** C’mon Daddy, tell us where we’re going!

**Stacy:** We’re almost there, sweetheart. 

**Ron:** In fact, we’re going inside now!

//As the family enters the SCP-6566 instance, decorations resembling SCP-6566-A instances can be seen on the shelves, often in configurations depicting scenes of one or more of the figures violently attacking others. Some figures can also be seen hanging from the ceiling from what appear to be small nooses fashioned from intestines.//

**Joshua:** Inside where?

**Stacy:** Here, why don’t you see for yourself!

//Stacy removes Joshua’s blindfold as Ron does the same for Kara. Both children express various excited vocalizations.//

**Kara:** Wow, Build-a-Boar workshop![[footnote]]It is unclear whether the fact that Kara knew and used the given name of SCP-6566 despite being blindfolded while entering the store was simply a correct guess based on the mostly pig-based decorations, or a byproduct of SCP-6566’s anomalous perceptual effects.[[/footnote]]

**Joshua:** Yay Yay Yay!

**Ron:** Surprise!

//At this point, SCP-6566-1 rises into view from behind the counter.//

**SCP-6566-1:** Why, hello there little ones! My name is Lucy, what’s yours? And are you two ready to build your new best friends?

**Kara and Joshua simultaneously:** Yeah!

**Ron:** See Stacy, I told you they’d love it.

**Stacy:** (//chuckling//) You were right, you were right honey.

//SCP-6566-2 pops out from behind one of the nearby shelves, despite the small shelf appearing to lack the size necessary to have fully obscured SCP-6566-2 from view.//

**SCP-6566-2:** Fantastic! Call me Ferris, by the way. Why don’t we get started?

**SCP-6566-1:** First thing’s first, what exactly do we want to build today?

//SCP-6566-1 brings the children’s attention to a shelf containing a series of empty, skin-like suits of varying sizes, colors, proportions, and apparel. Most clearly display porcine features, such as snouts, tusks, curled tails, etc.//

**Joshua:** Mmmm Ooh, I want the red one with the big face tooth horns!

**Kara:** I’m gonna make a pigasus princess!

**SCP-6566-1:** Great choices! Now, why don’t you all follow Ferris to the stuffing machine?

//The camera moves to follow SCP-6566-2 and the children, now revealing a large machine with a blood-spattered glass panel allowing view into it as sharp turnstiles on a rotating bar continuously mixes various entrails and viscera.//

**SCP-6566-2:** Ok, so now it’s time to fill up your Teddy Boars. Kara,[[footnote]]It is not clear how SCP-6566-2 gleaned Kara’s name, as neither of the children had given them, even when asked by SCP-6566-1.[[/footnote]] hand me your princess, please.

//SCP-6566-2 takes the small skin-suit from Kara and affixes a small hole on its torso to a nozzle on the machine, which then fills the object with its contents. The same is then done with Joshua’s.// 

**SCP-6566-1:** Alrighty, now before we zip up your little buddies, we have to bring them to life! Just pick a heart from the Basket Ferris is holding, and we’ll start with our special magic spell!

//Kara and Joshua pick from the container of small hearts from unknown animals, which appear to beat despite the lack of any connected body.//

**SCP-6566-2:**  So first off, did you guys happen to bring your own ritual daggers?

**Stacy:** …I’m sorry, wh—

**SCP-6566-1:** That’s Ok, we should have a couple that the kiddos can borrow. (//shouting//) HEY KING? CAN YOU GRAB A COUPLE DAGGERS?

//A door in the back opens, and SCP-6566-3 walks out holding an ornately crafted dagger in each hand. Agonized screaming can be clearly heard from behind the door, though no one present remarks or noticeably reacts to this.//

**SCP-6566-3:** Hi, I’m Manager King, and welcome to my little kingdom of fun! I’m glad to see you little rascals are already hard at work building some boar buddies for your own! (//SCP-6566-3 hands each child a dagger as it says this.//)
 
**SCP-6566-1:** Great! Now kids, repeat after me…

//The next seven minutes and six seconds of footage is heavily corrupted, with all attempts to view the video shifting to a mix of reddish static and multicolored flashing, permeated by heavily distorted voices producing garbled, indecipherable dialogue, interrupted periodically by what sounds like human screeching. When the video cuts back to normal, all parties appear unhurt despite being covered in moderate volumes of blood of unknown origin. No one visibly reacts to the blood.//

**SCP-6566-2:**  Good job, kids! Now your little piggies are alive! 

**Ron:** Wow, isn’t that exciting?

**Stacy:** Something seems… wrong…

**SCP-6566-3:** Nonsense! What could be wrong with making toys for children?

**SCP-6566-1:** Ok kids, now it’s time to dress your little pals.

**Kara:** Do you have any princess dresses that will fit over her wings?

**SCP-6566-1:** Of course, several! Let’s go take a look.

**SCP-6566-2:**  What about you Josh? What do you want your boar to wear?

**Joshua:** He’s a wizard, so he’ll need wizard stuff.

**SCP-6566-2:** I think I’ve got just the thing.

//SCP-6566-2 pulls out a dark red robe and matching pointed hat from a nearby shelf.//

**Joshua:** Yeah! Like that, but he also needs his magic staff.

**SCP-6566-2:**  Of course, he sure does. 

//SCP-6566-2 grabs what appears to be the femur of a small animal. It then assists Joshua in putting the red robes on Joshua’s new SCP-6566-A instance, before finally placing the bone “staff” in the instance’s hand. SCP-6566-1 and Kara come back into view, with Kara’s own SCP-6566-A instance now adorned with a ragged, torn green dress and a crown of thorns.//

**Kara:** Look Mommy, Daddy! Isn’t she pretty?

**Ron:** She sure is, sweetie.

//Stacy says nothing and simply nods with a dazed expression.//

**SCP-6566-3:** Now remember kids, the best part about a best friend is that they are someone you can ALWAYS trust. So, make sure to listen to your boars.

**Kara and Joshua, simultaneously:** Ok, Mr. King.

//the camera shifts as the SCP-6566-A instances are brought to the counter, before turning to face the ceiling as Ron places his phone on the counter.//

**SCP-6566-1:** Ok, and how will we be paying today; cash, soul, or card?

**Ron:** I’ve got cash.

After forcefully procuring the SCP-6566-A instances from Joshua and Kara Phillips to go along with the cellphone video from Ron Phillips, all members of the household were amnesticized, and the recovered SCP-6566-A instances were destroyed according to recently-established SCP-6566 procedures. 

Investigation into the exact origin, ultimate purpose, and full anomalous capabilities of SCP-6566 is ongoing, as is the search for any outlying SCP-6566-A instances resulting from any prior, as-yet-undiscovered SCP-6566 manifestations.
