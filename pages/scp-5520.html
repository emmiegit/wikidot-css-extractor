**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment of SCP-5520 is unnecessary at present.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Archon-class objects can be contained, but should not be.[[/span]] Should containment become necessary, SUNDOWN protocol must be initiated. The Lake Huron bulkhead gates will be opened, flooding Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-W. This will activate the expanding foam seeded into the facility, sealing it.

Scranton Reality Anchors must be strategically placed to direct the growth of AAF-W away from [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43 Site-43], the bed of Lake Huron and the surface.

All access to AAF-W is prohibited.

**Update:** SUNDOWN protocol may only be enacted by Overwatch Command, except under emergency circumstances.

**Description:** SCP-5520 is former SCP Foundation Senior Researcher and Provisional Site Co-Director Dr. Wynn Rydderech.

SCP-5520 is a Class-III reality bender, as a result of long-term exposure to esoteric materials. Correspondence with SCP-5520 has revealed serious and progressive cognitive impairment, dissociation, depersonalization, derealization, and both retrograde and anterograde amnesia. It remains aligned with the goals of the Foundation, but no longer answers directly to the executive structure.

SCP-5520 presently resides in a series of vast caverns and refineries located beneath Site-43, classified Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-W by former Site Director Dr. V. Lesley Scout. Though the facilities themselves exhibit no anomalous properties, their scale, their location, and the [http://www.scpwiki.com/the-b-b-decommission activities performed there] do. Both manual and automatic cave surveying techniques have been unable to determine the precise extent of AAF-W, but best estimates suggest over two million cubic metres of interior space. A breathable oxygen atmosphere pervades throughout, presumably as a result of SCP-5520&#39;s activities.

**Addendum 5520-1, Phenomenological Overview:** From 1915 to 1966 Dr. Wynn Rhys Rydderech headed the SCP Foundation&#39;s effort to manage the toxic materials generated by its catalogue of anomalous objects. His Acroamatic Abatement Group moved from Vienna, Austria to Provisional Site-43 in Canada in 1943, and he [http://www.scpwiki.com/the-good-work became Co-Director] with Dr. Vivian Lesley Scout. The Applied Occultism and Acroamatic Abatement Sections of that Site became, under his direction, the foremost facilities for studying and neutralizing esoteric effluence on Earth. When Site-43 was upgraded from provisional status in 1965, Dr. Scout became the Site Director with his partner&#39;s sponsorship.

Dr. Rydderech disappeared from Site-43 on the 14th of November, 1966, after fifty-one years of employment. Security and Containment Section agents searched his dedicated research laboratory in Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-A, and found it significantly altered and its forty-three staff members absent. Dr. Rydderech&#39;s notes revealed dozens of conflicting, frequently incoherent or unintelligible programs of research, suggesting that his disappearance had been voluntary. The entire Site was immediately placed on alert.

Dr. Scout ordered the Pursuit and Suppression Section to investigate the facility further.

//Log begins.//

**Control:** Describe your surroundings, please.

**Delta-1:** Roger. We&#39;re standing in AAF-A, in what should be the basement sublevel. Blueprints from Janitorial and Maintenance say this is as low as it goes. Ah... there are considerably more pipes on the walls here than the schematics show. Some of them don&#39;t look right.

**Control:** Elaborate.

**Delta-1:** I can&#39;t be sure without touching them, but at least some of these look like they&#39;re made out of bone? And maybe porcelain.

**Delta-5:** Bone china, maybe.

**Delta-1:** Hey.

**Delta-5:** Cutting chatter, sir.

**Control:** There&#39;s an open door leading to a stairwell at the end of the hall you&#39;re in, correct?

**Delta-1:** Correct, Control. No door or stairwell on the blueprints.

**Control:** Proceed downward with extreme caution, captain.

**Delta-1:** Roger.

//Delta-43 proceed to the next level of the facility without incident.//

**Delta-1:** Oh, what the hell.

**Control:** Elaborate.

**Delta-1:** The door at the bottom of the stairs is also open, Control. It opens onto a glass-walled tunnel. I can see cave walls outside the glass, illuminated by... I don&#39;t know. Illuminated.

**Control:** Proceed, and narrate.

**Delta-1:** This is definitely a connecting tunnel, there&#39;s another open door at the end. I can see a... very large cave system outside the tunnel. Very, //very// large.

//Delta-43 enter the adjoining facility.//

**Delta-2:** That&#39;s damn strange.

**Control:** Delta-2?

**Delta-2:** This place looks like... I&#39;ve seen photographs from Archives and Revision, of AAF-A in the forties. During the war, when they were building this place. That&#39;s what we&#39;re standing in now.

**Control:** You&#39;ve just left AAF-A, Delta-2.

**Delta-2:** No, sir, we&#39;ve just left the present-day version. I&#39;m telling you this is AAF-A as it used to look, twenty years ago.

**Control:** Understood. Please proceed.

**Delta-1:** Hold up.

**Control:** Report.

**Delta-1:** We&#39;ve found a few of Dr. Rydderech&#39;s researchers. They&#39;re examining some pipes, and taking notes.

**Control:** Approach them, with caution.

**Delta-1:** Roger. Hey! Identify yourselves!

//Silence on recording.//

**Delta-1:** Hey there!

//Fingers snapping.//

**Delta-1:** No response, control.

**Control:** Understood. Proceed.

//Delta-43 move through five sublevels of the new facility, before reaching a door in the same position as the door in the present-day AAF-A.//

**Delta-1:** The door is closed, Control.

**Control:** Understood. Can you open it?

**Delta-1:** Doesn&#39;t seem to be locked.

**Control:** Take a look.

**Delta-1:** Roger.

//A loud metal squealing, then silence on recording.//

**Delta-1:** ...oh.

**Control:** What do you see, Delta-1?

**Delta-1:** ...oh. Oh, good lord. Ah... copy, Control, I see what appears to be a... ravine. An underground ravine. Can&#39;t begin to speculate on the depth. There are... structures, at the bottom. Structures on the walls, as well. Looks like a natural cave system, ah... //augmented,// with artificial construction. Consistent with the alterations to AAF-A we&#39;ve already seen.

**Delta-5:** It looks like somebody turned ten factories inside-out and //stacked// them.

**Control:** Copy, Delta-5. Would you say this ravine and its contents are larger than AAF-A, Delta-1?

**Delta-1:** I would say that this ravine and its contents are larger than Site-43, Control.

Dr. Scout recalled Delta-43 to AAF-A to regroup and plan further investigations. The research personnel encountered in the parallel facility were not re-encountered.

The Identity and Technocryptography Section had recently completed the installation of an experimental Site-wide computer system with a rudimentary command line interface, the Site-43 Information Network (INFOnet). When Delta-43 returned to Dr. Rydderech&#39;s office, they discovered that his networked printer had produced the following message for Dr. Scout:

Dr. Rydderech was subsequently classified SCP-520. This file uses the present-day SCP-5520 classification, and appended documentation is amended to reflect this.

The duplicate AAF-A was thoroughly examined over the next fourteen months, revealing that it, like the original, had fallen out of use. It was determined that SCP-5520 and his phantom staff had moved into the larger facility in the caverns, which had by then expanded twofold.

As SCP-5520 had not corresponded with Site-43 at all during this period, Dr. Scout instructed Pursuit and Suppression to rappel down into the larger structure, designated AAF-W, and investigate it. A partial transcript of their exploration is appended below.

**Delta-1:** There&#39;s a... skyscraper of machinery. Gantries, pipes, tanks, chimneys and such protruding from the cave floor.

**Delta-5:** A cave-scraper. A cave //ceiling// scraper.

**Delta-1:** Must be one of the biggest buildings in the country, Control. Certainly the biggest thing underground.

The five remaining members of 43-Delta were subsequently returned by SCP-5520, through unknown means, to AAF-A. A message was already waiting for Dr. Scout in Dr. Rydderech&#39;s office.

By order of the O5 Council, Site-43 &#39;employed&#39; SCP-5520 from this point forward as a consultant researcher. Though Dr. Scout objected strongly to this practice, he agreed to remain SCP-5520&#39;s point of contact.

The Foundation began sending problematic substances to AAF-W. Geological measurements indicated that the artificial complex grew at a slow, steady rate every day for the next three decades. The efficiency of the Site-43 facilities improved at a commensurate rate, and SCP-5520 frequently delivered //ad hoc// research papers and chemical formulations to the Foundation via the printer in his former office.

**O5-8:** Please, help me to understand why you did what you did.

**Dr. Scout:** He gave his life to us, all of it, from start to finish. To the good work. I owed him this... courtesy.

**O5-8:** What you call a courtesy, I might call an execution. His life is //not// finished.

**Dr. Scout:** With respect, sir, you mean //you// aren&#39;t finished //with// his life. We&#39;re not talking about someone&#39;s abandoned grandfather, who just needs his loved ones to visit and brighten his day. We&#39;re not talking about someone with cognitive impairment who just needs patience and affection and rewarding work to live a meaningful life. Not anymore.

We&#39;re talking about someone who&#39;s been //completely alone// and //out of his mind// for //thirty years.// Most of Wynn Rydderech is gone, and what&#39;s left is crying out for help, and we&#39;re not listening.

I&#39;ve asked you, time and time again, to let me bring him back up here. To let me see if we can help him. He might never be the same, but at least he wouldn&#39;t be alone. He could live a real, human life, in the light. He would still be brilliant, he would still be //Wynn,// if we could manage his condition. But you refuse me, time and time again, and I&#39;ve come to realize that you&#39;re never going to let him get better. You&#39;re going to keep him sick in the dark for all eternity if you can, so you can benefit from his sickness.

We are perpetuating a falsehood, through anomalous means, because it is convenient for us. That&#39;s not the Foundation I, or he, signed up to work for. Or //built,// if you please.

**O5-8:** You&#39;re one to talk about anomalous perpetuation. How old are you now, Mr. Baggins? Eleventy-one, isn&#39;t it?

**Dr. Scout:** I&#39;m still myself. Wynn is not, by his own metrics. He left specific instructions for me on the matter, and his wishes are the only ones that should count. It&#39;s his life, and he put it in my hands. He //trusted// me. As his friend, and as his partner.

**O5-8:** I have access to the INFOnet feed. I&#39;ve seen what Rydderech is saying. Just last week he asked you to &#34;look in on Ashley.&#34; That doesn&#39;t sound like someone who&#39;s dissociating to //me.//

**Dr. Scout:** Do you know who Ashley is, sir?

**O5-8:** No, and I don&#39;t see why it matters. Is it his daughter? His cat?

**Dr. Scout:** His brother, sir. His //dead// brother, hit by a bus during the London Blackout of 1918.

//Silence on recording.//

**Dr. Scout:** He&#39;s suffering. And we&#39;re letting him suffer, keeping him //apart,// because he&#39;s useful to us. You know what he wants. If you&#39;ve seen the feed, you&#39;ve seen him begging for it. But you don&#39;t care. This isn&#39;t about him, it&#39;s about you.

//Silence on recording.//

**Dr. Scout:** You want to hear what Wynn, //actually// Wynn, thought about this?

//Dr. Scout pulls a folded, yellow sheaf of papers from his suit.//

**Dr. Scout:** Let me read this to you.

**O5-8:** What is it?

**Dr. Scout:** It&#39;s a letter he wrote. He asked that I open it if he ever became... compromised. He gave it to me the last time we went topside together, the day the Site became official. The first day of April, 1965.

I opened it thirty years ago.

**O5-8:** Fine. What does it say?

**Dr. Scout:** It says,

&#34;Vivian,

I&#39;m so pleased I got to see the lake one last time, and share that moment with you. As myself. Before...&#34;

//Dr. Scout pauses.//

**Dr. Scout:** &#34;...before what&#39;s going to happen to me. I know this is going to be difficult for you to understand, but I have to go away. I&#39;m a danger to you, to the Site, maybe even to myself. I&#39;ve tried to hide it, I&#39;ve tried to control it, but I&#39;m losing my grip. It&#39;s better for everyone if I disappear for a while.

Hopefully, I&#39;ll be back.

But if I&#39;m not, I need to you understand something for me. I need you to understand who, and what, I am. So that you&#39;ll also understand if it&#39;s not me you&#39;re seeing, or hearing, down there in the dark. So that you&#39;ll do what needs to be done, as you always have. As we used to do, together.

You remember what we used to say at Cardiff? I know you&#39;ve moved on to [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5382 magic words] and musty, dead old things, but I&#39;m sure you haven&#39;t forgotten. There&#39;s magic in these words, too: &#34;We are chemistry, and electricity.&#34;

That, and nothing besides. You and I are the sum of our electro-chemical reactions. Electricity is the fire that is our conscious selves, and chemistry is the beating of our hearts.

The wet, sparking computers in our heads are the most powerful thinking, feeling machines in existence, more complicated than anything we can devise. More points of failure than any bridge, any airplane, any equation. They always break down, in the end, and so do we. That ephemerality is part of the magic. The fire goes out, the heart stops beating.

Sometimes the fire goes out first, and we lose ourselves. We become //not// ourselves. Every human being has the right to decide where that line is drawn for themselves, personally. You know full well where I draw it.

Words have power, Vivian, but chemistry //is// power. If you change the chemistry, you change who you are.

And it doesn&#39;t take much.

Yours very truly,

- Wynn.&#34;

//Silence on recording.//

**O5-8:** Is that all, Dr. Scout?

**Dr. Scout:** Yes, sir.

**O5-8:** We&#39;ll take it under advisement.

**Dr. Scout:** ...thank you, sir.

I&amp;T continued to correspond regularly with SCP-5520 under O5 direction, and Dr. Scout resigned from the SCP Foundation on 1 April 1996.

Colleagues,

Per your offer of employment dated 1 April 1915, I must respectfully, retroactively, decline. You are not who I thought you were, and I, perhaps, am no longer who I thought I was.

You may keep your secrets, or you may benefit from them. You may not do both. If you continue to profit from the madness of our friend, you will soon find it impossible to hide him. The truth will out.

I should like to see the lake again.

He retired to the town of Grand Bend within the limits of Nexus-94, succumbing to advanced old age one year later. The following message was received from SCP-5520 that same day:

We are ready to announce Project RHETORIC. This cover should address the security and ethics concerns identified by Dr. Scout, allowing us to capitalize on the SCP-5520 asset indefinitely. Communications personnel assigned to the project will be rotated out regularly to prevent the creation of an empathetic bond, and amnesticized. With your approval, the following message will be released to 43NET on New Year&#39;s Day.

**Attention, all sections:** Welcome to the new millennium! The Identity and Technocryptography Section is now accepting research-related queries for submission to its quantum supercomputer, DR-RHETORIC (SCP-5520). Contact research associate Lyle Lillihammer via 43NET to apply. (I&amp;T will not be allowing users direct access to the DR-RHETORIC feed. Its artificial intelligence algorithms are extraordinarily complex, and the results often require significant interpretation by trained personnel.)

P.S. We&#39;ve tried to modify the network and the printer to filter out occurrences of &#34;Vivian&#34; and &#34;Viv&#34; in incoming messages, but no luck so far. I&#39;ll re-type each printout myself before passing it on to my staff.
