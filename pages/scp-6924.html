**Special Containment Procedures:** All instruments that concern Hume must be routinely screened for evidence of SCP-6924 instances growing inside or on it. If found, SCP-6924 instances must be removed. Due to the abundance of SCP-6924 and public knowledge of SCP-6924, it is not feasible or worth the foundation resources to establish containment. So, instead, scientific research is to be monitored for any publications related to SCP-6924’s anomalous attributes or Hume as a whole[[footnote]] This is supervised by Dr. Hazel at Site-25 with the Humatics Division.[[/footnote]]. As part of this, any studies focusing on SCP-6924 will be closely monitored by implanted agents. When possible, public research related to SCP-6924’s anomalous properties should be halted before publication.

In the event that their anomalous attributes are discovered: if caught before being published, all documentation of SCP-6924 regarding its anomalous attributes is to be destroyed and any researchers are to be injected with Class C amnestics. If the findings have already been published or the researchers cannot be amnesticized, their findings are to be discredited using a series of disinformation campaigns, including, if necessary, removal and isolation of researchers involved.

**Description:** SCP-6924 refers to the phylum of Tardigrade. All organisms in this phylum possess an anomalous protein that restricts the movement of Hume. As such, they become resistant to changes in Hume such as reality restructuring events, reality-bending, and disrupt instruments that use Hume. This protein has been denoted HUM-23 and resides in the outer membrane of the tardigrade. Aside from the presence of HUM-23 protein, SCP-6924 instances do not possess any other anomalous attributes.

When exposed to extreme Hume environments, the Tardigrade will act normally for about 5 months before undergoing cryptobiosis, shrinking into their tun form to regulate Hume. Experiments testing the extent they can exist in this environment and survive are ongoing,  [[footnote]] All testing has been and is being conducted securely at the Humatic division under the supervision of Head Researcher Casper. [[/footnote]]  with no casualties due to Hume decay so far after 13 years.
**Addendum:**
**Addendum-6924-Discovery Log- The Hellerman Incident:**
On December 12th 19██ Site-67 experienced a localized Class █ reality breakdown, in Lab-██.  researchers Jace Ornalee and Katt Watt were testing idle SRAs left in storage with Class Ⅲ reality bender, Claire Hellerman. A malfunction caused Hellerman’s powers to go out of control causing the death of the two researchers. Two guards, Hannah Boyle and Gabriel Romão were the first on the scene after the incident.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Hellerman Incident Logs&#34;]]
&gt; **██ SRA maintinance:** 3/15/██
&gt; **Purpose:** Test a series of Scranton Reality Anchors that have been in extended storage to ensure they are still functional.
&gt; **Procedure:** Claire Hellerman will manifest a metal sphere. Then, the SRA will be turned on, and then the team will repeat the procedure on each device. Hume levels will be monitored through each test and recorded. Any anchors resulting in abnormal results will be marked and sent for maintenance. Repeat until all of the anchors have been tested.
&gt; [Begin test audio log]
&gt; **Researcher Jace Ornalee:** Claire proceed when you feel ready.
&gt; **Clair Hellerman:** Well, here we go.
&gt; &lt;//slight hissing sound//&gt;
&gt; **Researcher Katt Watt:** Ok now I’ll activate the SRA, and on.
&gt; &lt;//whirring sound//&gt;
&gt; **Clair Hellerman:** This one is working.
&gt; **Dr. Ornalee:** Great round two, Claire can you make the sphere, please?
&gt; &lt;//slight hissing sound//&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Watt:** Great here goes the SRA.
&gt; **Dr. Watt:** Hey, Jace.
&gt; **Dr. Watt:** Something&#39;s wrong. The measurements are off.
&gt; [audio feed cuts off]
&gt; [begin body camera transcript]
&gt; &lt;//loud constant hissing noise//&gt;
&gt; **Command:** Hannah, is that interference coming from your feed?
&gt; **Hannah:** No, it is coming from the west wing.  I’m heading that way with Gabri...
&gt; &lt;//Loud crashing explosion//&gt;
&gt; **Command:** Hannah! Gabriel! Report your status! What is happening over there?
&gt; **Gabriel:** Something exploded up ahead.  We think it was from the lab-██. We can hear a faint voice from there.
&gt; **Hannah:** Who is currently in there right now?
&gt; **Command:** Looks like researchers Jace Ornalee and Katt Watt were testing some SRAs with Claire Hellerman a reality bender. Be careful.
&gt; **Hannah:** Affirmative. We are approaching the door. The voices are more audible, you may be able to pick them up on your side.
&gt; **---:** ...
&gt; **---:** ... wrong
&gt; *pause*
&gt; **---:** HELLERMAN!
&gt; &lt;flash of blue light can be seen from the door&gt;
&gt; **Hannah:** I have eyes on the observation deck of the lab. I can see two spectral figures. They look like Dr. Ornalle and Dr. Watt looking at readings…
&gt; &lt;Dr. Watt looks concerned staring at a screen&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Watt:** Hey, Jace.
&gt; **Dr. Watt:** Something&#39;s wrong. The measurements are off.
&gt; &lt;Dr. Ornalle’s eyes widen with alarm as he looks out the window&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Ornalle:** HELLERMAN!
&gt; &lt;the spectral figures glow a bright blue light before resetting&gt;
&gt; **Gabriel:** Command. They seem to be repeating. Should we advance?
&gt; **Command:** Yes. Proceed with caution into the room.
&gt; &lt;Continuing into the room, the glass window is obscured by an oily film&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Watt:** Hey, Jace.
&gt; **Hannah:** The test room door is jammed. Permission to breach the window.
&gt; **Dr. Watt:** Something&#39;s wrong. The measurements are off.
&gt; **Command:** Seal the door behind you, and be ready to retreat if you need to.
&gt; **Gabriel:** Breaching Window.
&gt; **Dr. Onalle:** HELLERMAN!
&gt; &lt;The glass //shatters// to the ground, and the oily film remains in the air&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Watt:** Hey, Jace.
&gt; **Hannah:** Gabriel, do you think it will be bad if I stick my head in this?
&gt; **Dr. Watt:** Something&#39;s wrong. The measurements are off.
&gt; **Gabriel:** Use your body camera first.
&gt; **Hannah:** Good call.
&gt; **Dr. Onalle:** HELLERMAN!
&gt; &lt;A spherical blast larger than the space available with an oily sheen on the rock acting as a one-sided mirror. At the center is a figure fallen on their back before a //grinding// SRA. The SRA starts to wind up but then clips to fully charged before //snapping// down and releasing a wave of blue light. Small rocks and particles fly around the room.&gt;
&gt; **Claire:** Jace, Katt RUN! I can’t control it!
&gt; **Dr. Watt:** Hey, Jace.
&gt; **Gabriel:** Claire! Calm down, we are here to help.
&gt; &lt;Gabriel starts to approach Hellerman&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Watt:** Something&#39;s wrong, the measurements are off.
&gt; **Claire:** No! Get back, it is too dangerous!
&gt; **Dr. Onalle:** HELLERMAN!
&gt; &lt;A cage-like metal sphere forms around Claire, expanding out and pushing Gabriel back before the SRA //snaps// down, //shattering// the cage and sending metal shards out. One //hits// Hannah in the shoulder.&gt;
&gt; **Hannah:** Claire, you need to stop!
&gt; **Claire:** No, No, I didn&#39;t do anything just ask Jace he will vouch for me!
&gt; **Dr. Watt:** Hey, Jace.
&gt; **Gabrie:**&lt;pointing to the spectral forms&gt; They are not here. Those are not real.
&gt; **Dr. Watt:** Something&#39;s wrong. The measurements are off.
&gt; **Claire:** No… I  can see them… I need to stop this.
&gt; **Dr. Onalle:** HELLERMAN!
&gt; &lt;Claire manifests a syringe and stabs it into their shoulder, and they fall prone as another shock wave rushes out from the SRA&gt;
&gt; **Hannah:** Gabriel! Secure the SRA. I&#39;ll get Hellerman.

&gt; **Hellerman Post-Incident interview log**
&gt; **Date:** December 15,19██
&gt; **Interviewee:** Claire Hellerman
&gt; **interviewer:** Shi ██████████
&gt; [begin log]
&gt; **Shi:** Please state your name for the record.
&gt; **Claire:** Where are Jace and Katt? I haven&#39;t seen them since the incident.
&gt; **Shi:** This is a formal interview.  Please state your name.  
&gt;**Claire:** Clair Hellerman. **Where** are Jace and Katt? Are they okay?  
&gt; **Shi:** Please keep to the questions.  . Your stunt caused the death of two Foundation personnel, destruction of a testing chamber, and risked this site of a containment breach.
&gt; **Claire:** What? Who’s dead? Jace? Katt? But I saw them after the initial blast!  
&gt; **Shi:** Researcher Jace Ornalee and Katt Watt were the casualties I spoke of earlier. What you saw was your mind recreating the image of them with the prompting stimuli of the SRA.
&gt; **Claire:** No. They can’t… they can’t be gone.
&gt; **Shi:** Were you planning for the SRA to stop working?
&gt; **Claire:** What?!? No. I had nothing to do with it going out of control.
&gt; **Shi:** Do you have any animosity towards the Foundation or its personnel?
&gt; **Claire:** I couldn’t, I am part of all this! These are my friends… I would never do anything to hurt them. I didn’t do anything. Something was wrong with the SRA!
&gt; **Shi:** The SRA in question is being investigated at the moment.  So we will get an answer on that soon.  Please focus on my questions.   Do you want to leave the Foundation?
&gt; **Claire:** No, I don’t know what is going on, but I know I can’t do anything out there.  Please!  Something was wrong with the SRA.
&gt; **Shi:** What do you think was wrong with the SRA?
&gt; **Claire:** I know practically nothing about how they work, but from my end, it looked like something was “jamming the gears” or like a blocked pipe.
&gt; **Shi:** We will get back to you with what comes out of the investigation. Until then, you will be kept in the temporary cell block in the west security wing.
&gt; **Claire:** please!  I didn’t do it!
&gt; &lt;door closes&gt;
&gt; **Shi:** I can&#39;t be sure exactly what happened, but I don’t think they could be untruthful in that state.

After further investigation, there was found to be an excessive amount of SCP-6924 living in the SRA. All SCP-6924 instances found here have been sent to the Humatics Division for classification and study. Hellerman will be returned to active duty as long as she attends weekly mental evaluation and counseling provided by internal services for as long as it is deemed necessary. 

 
**Addendum-6924-Test log:** [[footnote]] SCP-6924 instances are referred as Tardigrades in order to preserve understanding.[[/footnote]]
[[collapsible show=&#34;Test Logs&#34;]]
&gt; **Test-6924-1**
&gt; **Purpose:** To confirm sample tardigrades from the Hellerman Incident possess resistance to low Hume.
&gt; **Procedure:** Expose the Tardigrade samples to [[[SCP-710]]],[[footnote]]This is going off a slightly modified understanding of SCP-710 where its effects are due to a shift to low Hume.[[/footnote]] and monitor the samples after 20 days. Then, remove samples and compare Hume measurements.
&gt; **Results:**  During the Initial and middle stages (the first 8 days) the active tardigrades acted a bit distressed. Once the Late-stage began (day 10) the active tardigrades entered their tun form. There was no change for the rest of the test. The Tardigrades who were active at the beginning had their Hume drop a measurable amount, but the ones that stayed in tun form for the entirety of the time remain relatively the same.
&gt; **Researcher&#39;s notes:** A shift to low Hume was the main feature of what occurred during the Hellerman incident as the SRA tried to lower the reality-bending effects, and SCP-710 recreates this nicely. I am curious if this is something specific to these tardigrades though. – Dr. Berr
 
&gt; **Test-6924-2**
&gt; **Purpose:** To see if this is isolated to this sample of tardigrades, or just this species, or if all tardigrades are affected.  The sample of tardigrades from the SRA was identified as Coronarctus Disparilis (Spec-a).
&gt; **Procedure:** Expose three sets of tardigrade samples to SCP-710 and monitor the samples, after 20 days remove samples. Species in the experiment include Coronarctus Disparilis (Spec-a), Milnesium Tardigradum(Spec-b),  and Macrobiotus Sapiens (Spec-c).
&gt; **Results:** During the Initial and middle stages (the first 8 days) the active tardigrades acted a bit distressed. On day 9 the active Spec-c entered their tun form; once The Late-stage began (day 10) the active Spec-a entered their tun form; on day 11 active Spec-b entered the tun form. There was no change for the rest of the test. The tardigrades who were active at the beginning had the Hume drop a noticeable amount, but the ones that stayed in tun form for the entirety of the time remained relatively unchanged.
&gt; **Researcher&#39;s notes:** This is slightly concerning as we cannot contain all tardigrades, and due to their popularity in the scientific community, we need to be careful to make sure that people don’t discover Hume through research on tardigrades. I should also check if other Anomalous Tardigrades express this phenomenon as it may affect their containment.  – Dr. Berr
 
&gt; **Test-6924-3**
&gt; **Purpose:** To see if the effect observed in Test #6924-2 also applies to other anomalous tardigrades.
&gt; **Procedure:** Expose 2 sets of anomalous tardigrade samples to SCP-710 and monitor the samples, after 20 days remove samples. This includes [[[SCP-1773]]] and [[[SCP-157]]].
&gt; **Results:** During the Initial and middle stages (the first 8 days) the active tardigrades acted a bit distressed. Once the Late-stage began (day 10) both SCP-1773 and SC-157 samples entered their tun form. There was no change for the rest of the test. The tardigrades who were active at the beginning had their Hume drop a noticeable amount, but the ones that stayed in tun form for the entirety of the time remain relatively the same.
&gt; **Researcher&#39;s notes:** Well, they do express it but when looking into these cases I do not think that there is too much reason to worry as we do not use the extreme Hume environments in their containment. We can probably move on to the more specific qualities of their anomalous capabilities.  – Dr. Berr
 
&gt; **Test-6924-4**
&gt; **Purpose:** To confirm if they are more resistant when they are in their tun state rather than when active.
&gt; **Procedure:** Expose 2 sets of Tardigrade samples to SCP-710 and monitor the samples, after 20 days remove samples. An unmodified active sample was used as a control and compared to the following:  a modified sample (tardigrade-M) that was unable to change into its tun form and an unmodified sample that was already in its tun state.
&gt; **Results:**   During the initial stage (the first 6-7 days), the active unmodified tardigrades as well as the active, modified tardigrades became distressed.  The unmodified sample that was already in its tun state did not change.  During the middle stage (Day 7-8), both active samples became more distressed, but the active tardigrade-M samples appeared noticeably more lethargic than the active unmodified tardigrades.  The unmodified tardigrades already in its tun state remained unaffected.  Once the Late-stage began (day 10), the active unmodified tardigrades entered their tun form.  The Tardigrade-M samples became partially translucent and moved at an even slower rate. The unmodified tardigrades already in its tun state continued to be unaffected.  Once the unmodified tardigrades had entered tun state, there was no change for the rest of the test for the unmodified tardigrades.  The tardigrade-M samples became more translucent. By the terminal stage (day 14) the tardigrade-M has become completely transparent except for a slight silhouette and barely moving at all. At Expiration (day 15) the tardigrade-M completely dissipated with no left-over sign of their presence.
&gt; 
&gt;  In summary, the Tardigrades who were active at the beginning had their Hume drop a noticeable amount, but the ones that stayed in tun form for the entirety of the time remain relatively the same.
&gt; **Researcher&#39;s notes:** The fact that the unmodified tardigrades do better than the tardigrade-M samples at all stages makes me wonder if there is something about going into tun state that provides protection, even when they are out of tun state (since the unmodified tardigrades had been stored in their tun stage). Perhaps, they produce something that protects them when dehydrating. – Dr. Berr
 
&gt; **Test-6924-5**
&gt; **Purpose:** Attempt to isolate what is allowing the tardigrades to survive in these extreme environments.
&gt; **Procedure:** Use enzymes to remove specific organelles, proteins, and other organic molecules that are deemed to be non-anomalous with a high-precision Humatic camera.
&gt; **Results:** We were able to Isolate a protein that seemed to have no function. When put under a Kant Counter, it was unable to read a Hume, coming up as undefined. It is highly probable that this protein is the source of the tardigrade’s ability to resist Hume, though further testing is required. We have assigned the name Hum-23 to this protein.  In the case of civilian discovery of this protein, it can probably be excused as another vestigial quirk of evolution, due to its lack of apparent function.
&gt; **Researcher&#39;s notes:** Further testing has shown that when dehydrating into a tun, they produce the protein to protect themselves against Hume fluctuations, and some of it sticks around as it decays, confirming what was seen in Test-6924-4. I wonder how long HUM-23 will protect them, and if it would degrade faster if used on a larger scale though. – Dr. Berr
 
&gt; **Test-6924-7**
&gt; **Purpose:** To test the application for the HUM-23 protein in future containment.
&gt; **Procedure:** Create a paste from the tardigrades in tun form and apply it to two cubes. (Cube A and Cube B). Record the Hume of the cubes then place the two cubes along with a third that has no protein on it (Cube C)  in a Hume-controlled environment. Reduce the Hume past the point of decay risk. Then, leave the cubes in the environment and record any changes in the Hume at five minutes intervals.  Repeat this procedure for an environment with high Hume.
&gt; **Results:** When set in the low Hume environment for 5 minutes Cube A  and Cube B remained stable, while Cube C had become slightly translucent as it lost Hume. In the high Hume environment, Cube A and Cube B remained stable for the first hour, while Cube C became blurred with the air as its Hume raised. In both situations, Cube A and Cube B maintained the original Hume, and Cube C expressed a uniform loss of Hume. However, in just five minutes, the coating had degraded to only a thin film, practically gone.  During the second five-minute interval,  Cube A and Cube B were seen to be deteriorating similar to Cube C in its first five minutes.
&gt; **Researcher&#39;s notes:** I doubt it would be able to be used as a permanent protective coating due to the rapid degradation. Unfortunately, we can’t use the tardigrades in an unprocessed form as they do not affect the objects they are on. It&#39;s possible to create an environment where the decay could be stopped, but I doubt you could use it outside of the artificial environment. – Dr. Berr
 
&gt; **Long-term-Test-6924**
&gt; **Purpose:** Determine how long tardigrades can survive in extreme Hume environments.
&gt; **Procedure:** Place one set of tardigrades in a controlled Class B low Hume environment and another in a controlled Class B high Hume environment. Bi-annual checkups will be performed on both samples by removing them temporarily from the environments, to confirm if they are still active. Hume monitoring devices will be placed inside the environments to continuously monitor the samples alerting us to any immediate changes. Monthly maintenance is to be performed to account for Hume decay.
&gt; **Results:**  There have been no casualties from Hume decay yet ( 13 years into the test).-Ongoing-
&gt; **Approval notice:** The long-term test on SCP-6924 to determine the extent of their resistance to extreme Hume environments has been approved. For ease of study once started I will oversee the test and keep up with the maintenance. Please send any related documents to me once the test has started. SCP-6924 shows promise for further study. Thank you, Researcher Dr. Berr, for your contributions to the Foundation’s growing knowledge of the unknown. – Head Researcher Dr. Casper

**Addendum-6924-Study Report:** The Verum Constant
The Humatic division Lab at site-██ has been able to keep HUM-23 stable outside of SCP-6924 for extended periods. This was accomplished through a HUM-23 bioreactor maintaining constant temperature, pressure, and light while supplying it with 5 kW of energy at all times. The HUM-23 Bioreactor can be used to create a constant Hume environment that will not change. This allows us to use it to calibrate Humatic instruments such as the Kant counter. We are coining this as the Verum Constant. – Dr. Casper

**Addendum-6924-further info:**
&gt; **SCP Reclassification Proposal**
&gt; **Subject:** SCP-6924
&gt; **Reclassification Proposal:** from Apollyon to Thaumiel
&gt; **Reasoning:** While the fact that SCP-6924 can not be contained has not changed, it has potential use in containment and general management of the foundation. So, it would be appropriate to classify SCP-6924 as Thaumiel. HUM-23’s use to slow down humatic shifts would allow safer containment and mission operations.
&gt; **Current response:** At the moment, the application of SCP-6924 has not helped contain other anomalies. Due to the fact that the use of HUM-23 is not approved nor successfully implemented, the need to change the classification of SCP-6924 to be changed to Thaumiel is not necessary at the moment. This may be re-visited on a future date – Senior Researcher Dr. Lanfle
&gt; **Status:** Idle
