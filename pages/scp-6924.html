**Special Containment Procedures:** All instruments that concern hume must be routinely screened for evidence of SCP-6924 instances growing inside or on it. If found they must be removed. Due to the abundance of SCP-6924 and public knowledge of SCP-6924 it is not feasible or worth the foundation resources to establish containment. So, instead, scientific research is to be monitored for any publications related to SCP-6924’s anomalous attributes or Hume as a whole[[footnote]] This is supervised by Dr. Hazel at site-25 with the Humatics Division[[/footnote]]. As part of this, any studies focusing on SCP-6924 will be closely monitored by implanted agents. When possible, public research related to SCP-6924’s anomalous properties should be halted before publication.

If their anomalous attributes are discovered if caught before being published all documentation of SCP-6924 regarding its anomalous attributes is to be destroyed and any researchers are to be injected with class C amnestics. If the findings have already been published or the researchers cannot be anesthetized Their findings are to be discredited using a series of public campaigns.

**Description:** SCP-6924 refers to the phylum of Tardigrade, all organisms in this phylum possess an anomalous protein that restricts the movement of Hume. By doing this they become resistant to changes in Hume such as reality restructuring events, reality benders or disrupting instruments that use hume. This protein has been denoted HUM-23 and resides in the outer membrane of the tardigrade. Aside from the presence of HUM-23 protein, SCP-6924 instances do not possess any other anomalous attributes.

When exposed to extreme Hume environments the Tardigrade will act normally for about 5 months before undergoing cryptobiosis, shrinking into their tun form to regulate Hume. Experiments testing the extent they can exist in this environment and survive are ongoing[[footnote]] Ongoing tests are run by the Humatic division under Head researcher Casper [[/footnote]] for 13 years with no casualties due to Hume decay.
**Addendum:**
**Addendum-6924-Discovery Log- The Hellerman Incident:**
On December 12th 19██ site-67 experienced a localized class █ reality breakdown, in Lab-██.  researchers Jace Ornalee and Katt Watt were testing some idle SRAs left in storage with Claire Hellerman. A malfunction caused Hellerman’s powers to go out of control causing the death of the two researchers.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Hellerman Incident Logs&#34;]]
&gt; [begin body camera transcript]
&gt; &lt;loud constant hissing noise&gt;
&gt; **Command:** Hannah is that interference coming from your feed?
&gt; **Hannah:** No it is coming from the west wing, I’m heading that way with Gabri...
&gt; &lt;Loud crashing explosion&gt;
&gt; **Command:** Hannah! Gabriel! Report your status! What is happening over there?
&gt; **Gabriel:** Something exploded up ahead, we think it was from the lab-██, we can hear a faint voice from there.
&gt; **Hannah:** Who is currently in there right now?
&gt; **Command:** It looks like researchers Jace Ornalee and Katt Watt were testing some SRAs with Claire Hellerman a class Ⅲ reality bender. Be careful entering the area as a reality Bender is involved.
&gt; **Hannah:** Affirmative, we are approaching the door. The voices are more audible, you may be able to pick them up on your side.
&gt; **---:** ...
&gt; **---:** ... wrong
&gt; *pause*
&gt; **---:** HELLERMAN!
&gt; &lt;flash of blue light can be seen from the door&gt;
&gt; **Hannah:** I have eyes on the observation deck of the lab, I can see two spectral figures. They look like Dr. Ornalle and Dr. Watt looking at readings…
&gt; &lt;Dr. Watt looks concerned staring at a screen&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Watt:** Hey, Jace.
&gt; **Dr. Watt:** Something&#39;s wrong, the measurements are off.
&gt; &lt;Dr. Ornalle’s expression goes dark and look to the window&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Ornalle:** HELLERMAN!
&gt; &lt;the spectral figures glow a bright blue light before resetting&gt;
&gt; **Gabriel:** Command they seem to be repeating, should we advance?
&gt; **Command:** Yes, proceed into the room.
&gt; &lt;continuing into the room the glass window is obscured by an oily like film&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Watt:** Hey, Jace.
&gt; **Hannah:** The test room door is jammed, permission to breach the window.
&gt; **Dr. Watt:** Something&#39;s wrong, the measurements are off.
&gt; **Command:** Seal the door behind you and then you can. Be ready to retreat if you need to.
&gt; **Gabriel:** Breaching Window.
&gt; **Dr. Onalle:** HELLERMAN!
&gt; &lt;the glass shatters to the ground, the oily film remaining in the air&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Watt:** Hey, Jace.
&gt; **Hannah:** Gabriel, do you think it will be bad if I stick my head in this?
&gt; **Dr. Watt:** Something&#39;s wrong, the measurements are off.
&gt; **Gabriel:** use your body camera first.
&gt; **Hannah:** good call.
&gt; **Dr. Onalle:** HELLERMAN!
&gt; &lt;A spherical blast larger than the space available with an oily sheen on the rock acting as a one sided mirror. At the center is a figure fallen on their back before a struggling SRA. The SRA starts to wind up but then clips to fully charged before snapping down releasing a wave of blue light. Small rocks and particles fly around the room.&gt;
&gt; **Claire:** Jace, Katt RUN! I can’t control it!
&gt; **Dr. Watt:** Hey, Jace.
&gt; **Gabriel:** Claire! Calm down, we are here to help.
&gt; &lt;Gabriel starts to approach Hellerman&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Watt:** Something&#39;s wrong, the measurements are off.
&gt; **Claire:** No! Get back, it is too dangerous!
&gt; **Dr. Onalle:** HELLERMAN!
&gt; &lt; a cage forms around Claire expanding out pushing Gabriel back before the SRA snaps down shattering the cage sending metal shards out one hitting Hannah in the shoulder.&gt;
&gt; **Hannah:** Claire, you need to stop!
&gt; **Claire:** No, No, I didn&#39;t do anything just ask Jace he will vouch for me!
&gt; **Dr. Watt:** Hey, Jace.
&gt; **Gabrie, pointing to the spectral forms:** They are not here, those are not real.
&gt; **Dr. Watt:** Something&#39;s wrong, the measurements are off.
&gt; **Claire:** No… I  can see them… I need to stop this.
&gt; **Dr. Onalle:** HELLERMAN!
&gt; &lt;Claire manifests a syringe stabbing it into their shoulder and they fall prone and another shock wave ushers from the SRA&gt;
&gt; **Hannah:** Gabriel, secure the SRA, I&#39;ll get Hellerman.

&gt; **Hellerman Post-Incident interview log**
&gt; **Date:** December 15,19██
&gt; **Interviewee:** Claire Hellerman, Class Ⅲ reality bender
&gt; **interviewer:** Shi ██████████
&gt; [begin log]
&gt; **Shi:** Please state your name for the record.
&gt; **Claire:** Claire Hellerman. Where are Jace and Katt, I haven&#39;t seen them since the incident?
&gt; **Shi:** Hellerman, this is a glorified disciplinary hearing. Your stunt caused the death of two foundation personnel, destruction of a Testing chamber, and risked this site of a containment breach.
&gt; **Claire:** What? I didn’t do anything, something was wrong with the SRA!
&gt; **Shi:** The SRA in question is being investigated at the moment so we will get an answer on that soon.
&gt; **Claire:** Are Jace and Katt ok? I saw them after the initial blast.
&gt; **Shi:** Researcher Jace Ornalee and Katt Watt were the casualties I spoke of earlier. What you saw was your mind recreating the image of them with the prompting stimuli of the SRA.
&gt; **Claire:** No. They can’t be gone.
&gt; **Shi:** Were you planning for the SRA to stop working?
&gt; **Claire:** What?!? No. I had nothing to do with it going out of control.
&gt; **Shi:** Do you have any animosity towards the Foundation or its personnel?
&gt; **Claire:** I couldn’t, I am part of all this! These are my friends… I would never do anything to hurt them.
&gt; **Shi:** Do you want to leave the Foundation?
&gt; **Claire:** No, I don’t know what is going on, but I know I can’t do anything out there.
&gt; **Shi:** What do you think was wrong with the SRA?
&gt; **Claire:** I know practically nothing about how they work, but from my end it looked like something was “jamming the gears” or like a blocked pipe.
&gt; **Shi:** We will get back to you with what comes out of the investigation, until then you will be kept in the temporary cell block in the west security wing.
&gt; **Claire:** Uh… ok, all I can say is I didn’t do it.
&gt; &lt;door closes&gt;
&gt; **Shi:** I’m not sure what happened, but I don’t think they could be untruthful in that state.
[[/collapsible]]

After further investigation there was found to be an excessive amount of SCP-6924 living in the SRA. All SCP-6924 instances found here have been sent to the humatics Division for classification and study.

 
**Addendum-6924-Test log:** [[footnote]] SCP-6924 instances are referred as Tardigrades in order to preserve understanding[[/footnote]]
[[collapsible show=&#34;Test Logs&#34;]]
&gt; **Test-6924-1**
&gt; **Purpose:** To confirm sample tardigrades from the Hellerman Incident possess resistance to low Hume.
&gt; **Procedure:** Expose the Tardigrade samples to SCP-710[[footnote]]this is going off a slightly modified understanding of SCP-710 where it is due to a low Hume shift[[/footnote]] and monitor the samples after 20 days remove samples and compare Hume measurements.
&gt; **Results:**  During the Initial and middle stages (the first 8 days) the active tardigrades acted a bit distressed. Once The Late-stage began (day 10) The active tardigrades entered their tun form. There was no change for the rest of the test. The Tardigrades who were active at the beginning had their Hume drop a noticeable amount, but the ones that stayed in tun form for the entirety of the time remain relatively the same.
&gt; **Researcher&#39;s notes:** A low Hume shift was the main thing as that is what occurred during the Hellerman incident, and SCP-710 recreates this nicely. I am curious if this is something specific to these tardigrades though. – Researcher Dr. Berr
 
&gt; **Test-6924-2**
&gt; **Purpose:** To see if this is isolated to this sample of water bears or if all tardigrades are affected.
&gt; **Procedure:** Expose three sets of Tardigrade samples to SCP-710 and monitor the samples, after 20 days remove samples. Species in the experiment include Thermozodium esakii (Spec-a), Milnesium tardigradum(Spec-b),  and Coronarctus disparilis(Spec-c).
&gt; **Results:** During the Initial and middle stages (the first 8 days) the active tardigrades acted a bit distressed. On day 9 the active Spec-c entered their tun form, once The Late-stage began (day 10) the active Spec-a entered their tun form, and on day 11 active Spec-b entered the tun form. There was no change for the rest of the test. The Tardigrades who were active at the beginning had their Hume drop a noticeable amount, but the ones that stayed in tun form for the entirety of the time remain relatively the same.
&gt; **Researcher&#39;s notes:** This is slightly concerning as we cannot contain all tardigrades and due to their popularity in the scientific community, we need to be careful to make sure that people don’t discover Hume through research on tardigrades. I should also check if other Anomalous Tardigrades express this phenomenon as it may affect their containment. – Researcher Dr. Berr
 
&gt; **Test-6924-3**
&gt; **Purpose:** To see if this effect also applies to other anomalous tardigrades
&gt; **Procedure:** Expose 2 sets of anomalous Tardigrade samples to SCP-710 and monitor the samples, after 20 days remove samples. This includes SCP-1773 and SCP-157.
&gt; **Results:** During the Initial and middle stages (the first 8 days) the active tardigrades acted a bit distressed. Once The Late-stage began (day 10) both SCP-1773 and SC-157 samples entered their tun form. There was no change for the rest of the test. The Tardigrades who were active at the beginning had their Hume drop a noticeable amount, but the ones that stayed in tun form for the entirety of the time remain relatively the same.
&gt; **Researcher&#39;s notes:** Well they do express it but when looking into these cases I do not think that there is too much reason to worry as we do not use the extreme Hume environments in their containment. We can probably move on to the more specific qualities of their anomalous capabilities.  – Researcher Dr. Berr
 
&gt; **Test-6924-4**
&gt; **Purpose:** to confirm if they are more resistant when they are tuns rather than when active.
&gt; **Procedure:** Expose 2 sets of Tardigrade samples to SCP-710 and monitor the samples, after 20 days remove samples. This includes an unmodified sample (Tardigrades) and a modified sample (Tardigrades-M) making them unable to go into their tun form.
&gt; **Results:** During the Initial and middle stages (the first 8 days) the active tardigrades acted a bit distressed but during the middle stage (day 7-8) the tardigrade-M fell into a pattern of becoming lethargic in their movements. Once The Late-stage began (day 10) The active tardigrades entered their tun form the tardigrade-M became translucent and moved at a slower pace. There was no change for the rest of the test for the Tardigrades. By the terminal stage (day 14) the tardigrade-M has become completely transparent except for a slight silhouette and barely moving at all. At Expiration (day 15) the tardigrade-M completely dissipated with no left-over sign of their presence.  The Tardigrades who were active at the beginning had their Hume drop a noticeable amount, but the ones that stayed in tun form for the entirety of the time remain relatively the same.
&gt; **Researcher&#39;s notes:** This makes me think that they are probably able to survive due to something they produce when going dehydrating since some of the tardigrades that were active but not modified were affected by the SCP-710’s Hume field slower makes me think that some of it stay around after they rehydrate. – Researcher Dr. Berr
 
&gt; **Test-6924-5**
&gt; **Purpose:** Attempt to isolate what is allowing the tardigrades to survive in these extreme environments.
&gt; **Procedure:** Dissect a sample of Tardigrades when they are tuns then expose the components to extreme low Hume. Repeat dividing the sections till only the component responsible for their resilience is left.
&gt; **Results:** The first cycle removed the majority of the inner structures and the second cycle removed the majority of the membrane. After 3 cycles there appeared to be nothing left in the sample but Hume readings still showed a response. Using a high precision  ████████ we were able to map out the HUM-23 protein being present in the sample.
&gt; **Researcher&#39;s notes:** It is as clear as we can be that when going dehydrating into a tun they produce the protein to protect them against Hume fluctuations and some of it sticks around. I’ll need to do more research on how exactly Hume reacts to this protein allowing them their resilience to extreme Hume environments. – Researcher Dr. Berr
 
&gt; **Test-6924-6**
&gt; **Purpose:** Identify the specifics of how tardigrades react to high and low Hume differently.
&gt; **Procedure:** Expose 2 sets of Tardigrade samples to High and low Hume environments and monitor with a high precision  ██████████ to observe the specifics of how Hume interacts with the tardigrades.
&gt; **Results:** When it is exposed to high volatile Hume it directs the Hume past it, treating the immediate area around the protein as it tricks it into thinking it is at equilibrium. When exposed to volatile low Hume, it will try to pull Hume from the protein but due to its low Hume, the immediate area decays at an extremely low pace.
&gt; **Researcher&#39;s notes:** Ok this is interesting when concentrated in tun form they look as if they will provide almost complete protection to the extreme Hume environments. I wonder if we can use this for other applications for the foundation, it does seem to be less effective on larger scales but maybe it can be used for a protective coating for damaged areas. I wonder how long it will protect them, it probably would degrade more if used on a larger scale though. – Researcher Dr. Berr
 
&gt; **Test-6924-7**
&gt; **Purpose:** To test the application for the HUM-23 protein in future containment.
&gt; **Procedure:** Create a paste from the tardigrades in tun form and apply it to a cube (cube-a) and then one side of another (cube-b). Record Hume of the cubes then place the two cubes along with a third that has no protein (cube-c) on it in a Hume-controlled environment. Reduce the Hume to the point of decay risk then leave for twelve hours and record any changes in the Hume and repeat with a high Hume.
&gt; **Results:** When set in the low Hume environment for a day cube-a remained stable, only the side coated with the protein was stable the other sides became slightly translucent, and cube-c had become translucent. In the high Hume environment cube- remained stable, cube-b started to blur with the air except for the coated side, and cube-c became blurred with the air. In both situations, cube-a maintained the relative original Hume, cube-b mostly lost Hume on uncoated sides, cube-c uniformly lost Hume, and the coating had degraded to only a thin film practically gone.
&gt; **Researcher&#39;s notes:** We most likely will be mainly able to use this as an emergency protective agent applied for short-term protection as it quickly degrades under pressure. This degradation is probably due to how the protein is removed from the structure and is being used to slow the decay of larger areas. Unfortunately, we can’t use the tardigrades in an unprocessed form as they have no effect on the object they are supposed to be protecting. – Researcher Dr. Berr
 
&gt; **Long-term-Test-6924**
&gt; **Purpose:** Determine how long tardigrades can survive in extreme Hume environments.
&gt; **Procedure:** Place one set of tardigrades in a controlled class B low Hume environment and another in a controlled class B high Hume environment. A bi-annual checkup is to be performed on both samples removing them from the environments, to confirm if they are still active. Hume monitoring devices will be placed inside the environments to continuously monitor the samples alerting us to any immediate changes. Monthly maintenance is to be performed of this to account for Hume decay.
&gt; **Results:**  There have been no casualties from Hume decay, yet (records 13 years into the test).--Ongoing--
&gt; **Approval notice:** The long-term test on SCP-6924 to determine the extent of their resistance to extreme Hume environments has been approved. For ease of study once started I will oversee the test and keep up with the maintenance, please send any related documents to me once the test has been started. SCP-6924 shows promise for further study, thank you Researcher Dr. Berr, for your contributions to the Foundation’s growing knowledge of the unknown. – Head Researcher Dr. Casper

**Addendum-6924-Study Report:** The Verum Constant
The Humatic division Lab at site-██ has been able to keep HUM-23 stable outside of SCP-6924 for extended periods of time. This was accomplished through a HUM-23 bioreactor maintaining constant temperature, pressure, light, no movement, and supplying it with 500w of energy at all times. The HUM-23 Bioreactor can be used to create a constant Hume environment that will not change, this allows us to use it to calibrate Humatic instruments such as the Kant counter. We are coining this as the Verum Constant.
-Head researcher Dr. Casper

**Addendum-6924-futher info:**
&gt; **SCP Reclassification Proposal**
&gt; **Subject:** SCP-6924
&gt; **Reclassification:** from Apollyon to Thaumial
&gt; **Reasoning:** While the fact that SCP-6924 can not be contained has not changed Uses in containment and general management of the foundation, it would be appropriate to classify SCP-6924 as Thaumical. HUM-23’s use to slow down humatic shifts would allow safer containment and mission operations.
&gt; **Current response:** At the moment, the application of SCP-6924 is not to help contain other anomalies. Due to the fact that the use of HUM-23 is not approved or implemented, the need to change the classification of SCP-6924 to be changed to Thaumial is not necessary at the moment. This may be re-visited on a future date – Senior Researcher Dr. Lanfle
&gt; **Status:** Idle
