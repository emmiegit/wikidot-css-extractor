**Item #:** SCP-5534

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-5534 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Humanoid Containment Site-06-3. Experimentation with SCP-5534 is not permitted. All human interaction requires approval from its appointed child psychiatrist[[footnote]]For further information, please contact Dr. Allan Bowes.[[/footnote]].

**Description:** SCP-5534 is a human child, age 10. 

Provided SCP-5534 believes that it is being tested, any information thus obtained will pose cognitohazards[[footnote]]Copied and verbally relayed information will lose its anomalous properties.[[/footnote]] embedded in whichever medium SCP-5534 conveys it.

Individuals affected by SCP-5534 feel an urge to vocalize hostile speech directed at it. The severity and duration time of this effect is dependent on the amount of information perceived.

**Addendum 5534.1: Discovery.** 

SCP-5534 was discovered on 2020/05/02, when a Foundation agent embedded within the local Child Protective Services (CPS)[[footnote]]Both of SCP-5534&#39;s parents are alive.[[/footnote]] office of Wichita, Kansas, United States, witnessed SCP-5534&#39;s caseworker verbally abusing it. Coworkers gathered, and were subsequently affected after reading a form SCP-5534 had filled out. Suspecting the effect of a cognitohazard, the agent confiscated the document and alerted The Foundation. The affected individuals were amnesticized and SCP-5534 was contained.

**Addendum 5534.2: Interview log.** 

&gt; **Interviewed:** [SCP-5534]
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** [Dr. Allan Bowes]
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Foreword:** Following the assessment of the anomaly, Dr. Allan Bowes, a Foundation child psychiatrist, was tasked to perform SCP-5534&#39;s psychological evaluation. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Dr. Bowes proposed that his interview be conducted in a non-formal setting, hypothesizing that the anomaly could be circumvented in this manner. The interview was conducted at Site-06-3 staff cafeteria.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Allan Bowes:** Hi! My name is Allan, I thought you might be a bit tired of going through all those tests, right? I figured you might enjoy, well, just hanging out for a bit. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5534:** //(Does not respond)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Allan Bowes :** This site is a safe place, it&#39;ll feel different from what you&#39;re used to. Different from how it was at home, or school. We look after all kinds of people, people that need to be cared for in a special way.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5534:** //(Does not respond)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Allan Bowes :** Tell you what, I noticed a little something in the backpack you had coming here. The vending machines here aren&#39;t too bad, give me a second.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Allan Bowes :** //(Walks towards the cafeteria&#39;s vending machine, and comes back with two Bounty candy bars)// I was really happy when I saw that wrapper. We coconut fans aren&#39;t common. Here, one for you, one for me.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5534:** //(Unintelligible)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Allan Bowes :** I didn&#39;t quite catch that. Could you speak up, if that&#39;s alright?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5534:** Can I have my backpack?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Allan Bowes :** Why, sure—
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5534:** Please. I&#39;m sorry I forgot to say please.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Allan Bowes :** That&#39;s alright, I don&#39;t mind at all! I&#39;m not the most polite guy around. You can have it back, we had it put aside somewhere safe while you were getting settled in here, just so it wouldn&#39;t get lost. It must be important to you.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5534:** //(Nods)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Allan Bowes :** Is there anything in particular inside it that you want to get back?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5534:** Ye—No.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Allan Bowes :** Okay. No worries, you&#39;ll get everything back, I promise. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5534:** //(Glances at Dr. Bowes for an instant, then looks down)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Allan Bowes :** I&#39;m gonna ask a friend of mine to bring it by, since I&#39;m quite busy today. Here, write down what was in it, so he makes sure nothing&#39;s missing. You can use my notebook.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5534:** //(Writes for approximately 5 minutes before handing the notebook back to Dr. Bowes and covering its ears.)//[[footnote]]A non-anomalous copy can be found in Addendum 5534.3.[[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Allan Bowes :** //(Closes notebook. Nods and smiles at SCP-5534.)// It&#39;s okay. You did great. See? Hanging out and snacking is all we&#39;re doing. I&#39;ll walk you back to your room.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Addendum 5534.3: Item list** 

&gt; - One pencil.
&gt; - Two erasers.
&gt; - One Wite-Out pen.
&gt; - Candy bar wrappers. [[footnote]]After its backpack was returned, SCP-5534 was seen inserting an additional wrapper inside of it.[[/footnote]]

**Addendum 5534.4: Excerpt from Dr. Bowes&#39;s notes.** 

&gt; Before joining The Foundation, my duty was to help children much like SCP-5534. My duty is now to Secure. Contain. Protect. While the latter is of the utmost priority, they do not always have to conflict with each other. 
&gt; 
&gt; As far as I can tell, two theories must be correct in order to neutralize it : 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; - SCP-5534 is immune to its own anomalous properties, which I believe is the case given our interaction.
&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt; - SCP-5534 did not become anomalous overnight, neither was it born anomalous. This property might have been nurtured and reinforced by experiencing a non-anomalous, yet similar reality. A perpetual cycle allowing for an eventual transition into the anomalous. SCP-5534 probably hasn&#39;t even noticed anything out of the ordinary whenever this occurred. 
&gt; 
&gt; I cannot imagine the damage a single mistake on my part might cause. Extreme caution is necessary, as there&#39;s no telling when it may feel like it&#39;s being &#34;tested&#34;. Frankly, at the moment, I am not sure how to proceed. Effective therapy is going to be difficult.
