I began walking along the hall to the briefing room. Another situation had come up, and I was expected to be present. As I walked my secretary Gloria walked alongside, giving me a cup of joe.

&#34;What&#39;s the sitch, Glor?&#34; I took a sip.

&#34;&#39;Nother possible scip. Non-sent RB. Chrono. Might be artificial.&#34;

&#34;No kiddin&#39;? Big F?&#34;

&#34;Nah, not Big F or Dr. Dubya. They&#39;re thinking Pro Labs.&#34;

&#34;Geez, ever since T-kill I haven&#39;t heard anything from that place.&#34;

She shrugged and opened the briefing room door for me. I nodded and thanked her.

&#34;Gentlemen.&#34;

&#34;Heads up boys, it&#39;s the SD.&#34;

&#34;Whuzzat? The suck dick?&#34;

We all laughed and I sat down at the head of the table, looking at the men before me. We&#39;d been in and out of this room hundreds of times before. Everything from CBs to possible CI attacks made us cram into this room every day.

&#34;What&#39;s the story, boys?&#34;

&#34;Big one this time Ralph. We&#39;re thinkin&#39; a K.&#34;

&#34;Well shit. I hear there&#39;s Pro Labs involvement.&#34;

&#34;Yeah. Some Gawk guys gave us some intel.&#34;

&#34;What?&#34;

&#34;Non-sent object. RB. Chrono, we&#39;re thinkin&#39;. Might also be prob bending.&#34;

&#34;Some Wie-oo guys actually found it, Ralph. Ran back cryin&#39; all the way to the FBI.&#34;

I laughed. &#34;We got an MTF on this?&#34;

&#34;Yep. A-23. No pro-rep from them yet.&#34;

&#34;Ok. Big S is done. Big C?&#34;

&#34;Containment&#39;s goin&#39; well. We got some psyche immunes watchin&#39; it for a while, just in case.&#34;

&#34;Big P?&#34;

&#34;Gawk had intel, so they might come after it. Can&#39;t break into here though under the Anom treaty.&#34;

&#34;Right. Who&#39;s testing?&#34;

&#34;We got Doc James on the go. Y&#39;know him. Did some work with HTD Rep.&#34;

&#34;Oh yeah.&#34;

The radio crackled in at the center of the desk. &#34;Got the dash E in our sites. Ready to big C. Requesting permission.&#34;

Frank leaned over and pressed a button. &#34;You are go to contain Alpha-23.&#34;

&#34;Roger that.&#34;

Frank looked over at me. &#34;Another one in the bag, Ralph.&#34;

I nodded and watched the map behind him blip for a minute or two. The radio voice crackled on again. &#34;We got a successful contain. Returning to base.&#34;

&#34;Roger that, over and out.&#34; Frank turned off the radio.

I looked around. &#34;Good work men. Lunch?&#34;

They all nodded and we departed. I got a BLT.</textarea></pre>
