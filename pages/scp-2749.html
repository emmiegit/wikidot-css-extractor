**Item #:** SCP-2749

 **Object Class:** Safe

 **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2749 and SCP-2749-A instances are to be kept in separate containment lockers in Site-73 at all times. Interaction with SCP-2749 must only be done through the use of remote control, as this method has proved acceptable to circumvent the items&#39; anomalous effects. No further containment procedures are necessary at this time.

 **Description:** SCP-2749 is a 120cm long black and red cotton tie. If SCP-2749 comes into physical contact with any inanimate object with a mass less than 10kg, a tie identical to SCP-2749 will appear wrapped around that object. Removal of this secondary tie will result in a negation of SCP-2749&#39;s effects. Objects affected by SCP-2749 are designated SCP-2749-A. [[footnote]] If an object is too large for SCP-2749 to manifest, this anomaly will not occur. [[/footnote]]

 Once affected, SCP-2749-A will display sapience with high levels of intelligence.
 SCP-2749-A instances react to visual and auditory stimuli through unknown means. Additionally, instances are capable of independent locomotion. 

 The way SCP-2749-A instances communicate is dependant on the object affected. English is the primary language used by SCP-2749-A instances. Topics of conversation appear to be limited to an unknown organisation identified as &#39;Business Incorporated.&#39;

 [[collapsible show=&#34;+ Experiment-2749-A (2016/06/02)&#34; hide=&#34;- Hide&#34;]]
 During experiment-2749-A (2016/06/02), all instances of SCP-2749-A were placed in a single testing chamber. Instances included:
* 1 pencil (affected)                 
* 4 chairs (affected) 
* 2 small tables (affected)         
* 20 disposable plastic cups (affected)                        
* 1 stapler (affected)                
* 1 children&#39;s bicycle (affected)  
* 1 laptop (affected)
* 1 printer (affected)           
* 50 A4 sheets of paper (unaffected)               
* 2 large tables (unaffected)
* 5 ink cartridges (unaffected)
* 2 2x5m plywood walls (unaffected)
* 1 coffee machine (unaffected)
* 3 A1 sheets of paper (unaffected)

 SCP-2749-A instances immediately constructed a crude conference room using the materials provided. This included a logo displaying:

&gt;------
&gt; **WELCOME TO THE BUSINESS INC. METAL BOX BRANCH!**
&gt;           //It&#39;s __everyone&#39;s__ business!//
&gt; If you have any requests to make, please go to the reception area!
&gt;------
  
 The following was recorded via CCTV.
&gt;------
&gt; **9:00am 2016/06/04**
&gt; 
&gt; //(Several instances of SCP-2749-A are seen gathered on the large table communicating with a series of taps which were translated from Morse code.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A1 (pencil):** Hello everyone, it&#39;s nice to see you all at today&#39;s business meeting. Today I&#39;d like everyone to express their thoughts on Mr. Tables&#39;s new business plan!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A5 (table 1):** Thank you, pencil. Before we start, would anyone like refreshments?
&gt; 
&gt; //(7 instances of SCP-2749-A9 (plastic cups) use the coffee machine to fill themselves with coffee. They then approach several different instances of SCP-2749-A, which quickly move into them, spilling the coffee.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A3 (laptop):** Mmm... That was refreshing.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A8 (printer):** Table was thinking about our success rate, and made this graph to show you all how it&#39;s at a steady decline.
&gt; 
&gt; //(SCP-2749-A8 prints a line graph displaying the &#34;business ratio&#34; from 2000-2016.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A2 (chair 1):** Unbelievable! I thought it was rising at this juncture! 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A1:** If that acluistic boomerang hadn&#39;t changed the structure we wouldn&#39;t be in this mess! He should have known this was risky business.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A4 (stapler):** Honest to God, this should have been our highpoint, not our downfall!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A5:** And that is why I&#39;m here. You see our bike friend over there? He&#39;s in contact with a business management team that claim they can deliver business stocks twice as quick and twice as cheap! I think we can call it: &#34;Business Inc.&#39;s Fast Business&#34; I&#39;m aiming for efficiency improvements across the piece.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A6 (bike):** All he has said is true. Have a look at this!
&gt; 
&gt; //(SCP-2749-A6 moves across the room utilising its wheels.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A3:** Now that&#39;s in the black.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A8:** As you probably know, this is Business Inc.&#39;s 150th anniversary. Here, I thought I might piggyback on table&#39;s idea...
&gt; 
&gt; //(SCP-2749-A8 prints a sign reading:)//
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **BUSINESS INC.** 
&gt;&gt; //__Everyone&#39;s__ business for over 150 years.// 
&gt;&gt; To celebrate **Business Inc.**&#39;s 150th anniversary, we&#39;d like to introduce //**__FAST BUSINESS__**//, the __revolutionary__ way for you to get in touch with some //business// **2x** as fast as before! 
&gt;&gt; Because of this, we&#39;ve decided to give our customers a free 1 month trial for //**__FAST BUSINESS__**// for you to enjoy!
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s EASY to apply! Simply:
&gt;&gt; Read this sign!
&gt;&gt;  Apply!
&gt;&gt; And finally, **business!**
&gt;&gt; From the one and only: **MR. BUSINESS**
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A1:** Very well done printer!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A3:** Good show! That, people, is an advertisement that means business. I&#39;ll ping Mr. Business so we can peanut butter out the tasks.
&gt; 
&gt;  //(All instances of SCP-2749-A leave the room and resume their ordinary behaviour.)//

&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-2749-A3
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. ███
&gt; **Foreword:** Investigation of &#34;Business Inc.&#34;
&gt; **Time:** 6:00am 2016/06/06
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;Begin Log&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███:** Good morning, SCP-2749-A3.
&gt; 
&gt; //(SCP-2749-A3&#39;s monitor activates, displaying the following text)//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A3:** And good morning to you too, doctor! Not that&#39;d I&#39;d be able to tell if it were morning here, I mean, the sky here doesn&#39;t change much (not at all from what I&#39;ve seen). I&#39;m not able to tell the state of day by tasting the air or whatever like you natives can.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███:** Natives of where?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A3:** Why, the metal box of course! Also, may I say that you should really check out the all new **BUSINESS INC. METAL BOX BRANCH**, which we&#39;ve brought to the village of chamber T-2749!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███:** Right. So, you say that this is one of your branches, could you tell me where else you may have established your enterprise?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A3:** Of course! Now, you may find that most of these areas are fairly distant from your land, but if you&#39;re on the go or whatnot you might want to have look! I mean, it&#39;s good business! We have locations in: 
&gt; XetoJi (Who can forget?!)
&gt; Sqpp (The foodie&#39;s choice)
&gt; 921003 (Cool, in more ways than one!)
&gt; _-_I (Nice n&#39; classy)
&gt; DJEY (GREAT WEATHER THERE!)
&gt; O.O.O (The city of love!)
&gt; And who can forget our capital, Business! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███:** Ok, so, who is your boss?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A3:** The one and only! MR. BUSINESS!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███:** Could you tell me who this Mr. Business is?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A3:** I can do better than &#34;tell you&#34;, I CAN SHOW YOU!
&gt; 
&gt; //(SCP-2749-A3 proceeds to print an image depicting a yellow tie with a tie identical to SCP-2749 wrapped around it.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███:** And what services does this organisation provide?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A3:** Oh doctor, don&#39;t be silly! We provide //business//, of course! That&#39;s our business!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███:** So I see. That&#39;ll suffice for now, SCP-2749-A3.

 **Interview 2749-B**

&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-2749-A3
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. ███
&gt; **Foreword:** Investigation of &#34;Business Inc.&#34;.
&gt; **Time:** 6:00am 2016/06/07 
&gt; &lt;Begin Log&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███:** Morning SCP-2749-A3.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A3:** Ahh, good morning to you, doctor! Another unidentifiable morning here at Metal Box! Now, let&#39;s get down to business!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███:** Could you tell me about how your branch came into existence?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A3:** Oh yes! I was enjoying myself one day until BEEP, it was a call from MR. BUSINESS! He said to me, &#34;//Laptop, you have business to attend to – work in a foreign land.//&#34; And that&#39;s all I needed to know! I said goodbye to my family, my friends and... SWOOSH, I was off! Over time, Mr. Business sent more and more colleagues. Printer, pencil, bike, some cups to serve us... And the **BUSINESS INC. METAL BOX BRANCH** was born!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███:** And what did Mr. Business ask you to do?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A3:** Business.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███:** How long do you suppose the branch will last?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A3:** As long as it takes! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███:** As long as it takes to do what, exactly?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A3:** To deliver business to this world! Funny, most of the work was already done before we got here... We used to have a branch in a land called the &#34;USA&#34; or something, and the states is pretty close to this place, so maybe they had some influence on your culture.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███:** Where were you before you came here?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A3:**  Our business capital, good ol&#39; Business!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███:** And how did you get here?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A3:** &#34;Wherever there&#39;s a doorway, there&#39;s business!&#34; - MR. BUSINESS
&gt; It&#39;s actually hard to explain, but I think it has something to do with being placed- hey, this is a PERSONAL question! Nothing personal, just //business//!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███:** I&#39;m simply asking for the background of your employees.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A3:** Well, ok, I guess I gotta be honest here. I don&#39;t //really// know the answer. Maybe I&#39;ll ask Mr. Business himself!
&gt; 
&gt; //(SCP-2749-A3 pauses for roughly 30 seconds)//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A3:** He says: &#34;//The calls of our lord to business are a force that cannot be described in words or even thoughts.//&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███:** Your lord? Is that Mr. Business?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A3:** No, Mr. Business is our boss. He tells us that business is the path to enlightenment and it should be spread throughout these pagan lands.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███:** I think so. That&#39;ll do, SCP-2749-A3.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2749-A3:** Remember doctor, //it&#39;s everyone&#39;s business!//
