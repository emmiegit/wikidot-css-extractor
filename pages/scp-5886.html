**Item #:** SCP-5886

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-5886 is seemingly self-contained within Humanoid Containment Chamber #1939 (HCC-1939) at Site-42. Testing of SCP-5886 has been suspended until feasible means of doing so are found.

**Description:** SCP-5886 appears to be a dark-skinned male, approximately aged in its late teens or early twenties. Since its discovery, the subject has been completely motionless and intangible. The only evidence to SCP-5886&#39;s identity is its T-shirt, which bears the words &#34;I am James Biggio. Leave me alone.&#34; written in black marker. A background check into the name James Biggio turned up a missing person&#39;s report for the subject out of Athens, Ohio, dated December 4th, 2013.

Attempts to remove the bed SCP-5886 is lying on result in personnel appearing outside of the containment chamber with no memory of leaving the room. Adjustments to temperature within the chamber are similarly reversed.

**Discovery Log:** SCP-5886 manifested inside of HCC-1939 on October 7th, 2014. Janitorial staff discovered the subject lying on the bed and alerted site security. Security unsuccessfully attempted to apprehend the subject before contacting research staff.

**Addendum SCP-5886-1: Disappearance** 

On August 18th, 2020, the Pegasus Rising Project[[footnote]] A Site-42 based trans-dimensional experiment with the goal of providing a means of evacuation in case of a failure to avert an XK-Scenario. [[/footnote]] successfully created a wormhole for a span of 5 microseconds, causing a power outage throughout Site-42. Upon a safety check of containment chambers, SCP-5886 was missing from its chamber; a note was left in its place. The contents of the letter are transcribed below.

&gt; The snowflakes froze mid-air.
&gt; 
&gt; So did everything around me. The cars on the street, my parents...  I screamed at them. I pushed  my dad and he hung in the air, frozen like the snowflakes. I called for help. I searched through town for anyone who would move. I walked around for hours. The whole town was stone still.
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#39;t know when I fell asleep, but when I woke up, it was still night. I went back for my parents. My dad had moved. Not in front of me, but he wasn&#39;t hanging in the air. He was half-way from where I left him and the ground. My mom was looking at him now. 
&gt; 
&gt; I stayed with them for a while, but eventually I went exploring. I stopped in a restaurant and picked up some food. Left some cash, not that it matters at this point. While I was eating on a bench, I saw a hummingbird floating in the air next to the bushes. It had this beautiful red color under its throat, and I sat and watched it. After an hour or so (I&#39;m guessing, my watch and cell phone are useless), I noticed its wings were moving. Not that I could see, but it was definitely halfway from top to bottom when it was at the top before.
&gt; 
&gt; In my time like this, I&#39;ve read every new book in every library I&#39;ve come across. Not a lot of TV shows I can watch. A ruby-throated hummingbird beats its wings 50 times every second, and it took an hour and a half for it to move halfway. 
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;ve helped people too. People in front of cars about to get hit? Falling off a bridge? I&#39;ve saved lives. But then they just stare off into nothing. I want to say I got used to not being thanked, but...
&gt; 
&gt; This fucking sucks.
&gt; 
&gt; I found one of your guys in a library in Chicago; they had dropped a bunch of books with pictures of a [[[SCP-3086 |weird blue mouse]]] and I saw a logo I didn&#39;t recognize on their badge. I came here and found your library. The things you guys research here are incredible. God, I wish I could see some of it in action.
&gt; 
&gt; Then I saw this thing you guys are calling Pegasus Rising; a wormhole to another dimension? Finally, something different, maybe someone I could talk to.
&gt; 
&gt; So I picked an empty cell and stayed here. Stayed still long enough that you guys could actually see me. And now you don&#39;t. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the room.

SCP-5886&#39;s reclassification to Uncontained is pending.
