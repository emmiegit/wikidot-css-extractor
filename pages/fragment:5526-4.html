**Intermediate Security Measures:** ISM-5526 is to be contained within a modified Siminoid Containment Enclosure locked using Theurgic rituals and interacted with daily. All abnormalities and technological devices are to be located at minimum 50 meters from ISM-5526&#39;s enclosure. All testing must first be approved by both the Department of Morality and a committee composed of 12 level 4 Biological Researcher Personnel, per standard Organization sapient testing protocols. Any requests made by ISM-5526 are to be approved on a case-by-case basis by the project head of ISM-5526.

ISM-5526 is to be communicated within  --48-- 24 hours after its latest &#34;Famine State&#34; by an Organization psychologist using an Omni-Translator, only to be brought within the radius during this time. Three armed security officers are to accompany all food delivery, testing, and standard psychological interviews with ISM-5526.

**Description:** ISM-5526 is a //Simia Solis//[[footnote]]Child of the Sun[[/footnote]] with levels of intelligence equal to that of a typical Yeren, along with several other abnormal properties. Although ISM-5526 is typically docile towards personnel, and even cooperative, at times it will enter a &#34;Famine State&#34;, becoming hostile and presumably losing all sapience. While in this &#34;Famine State&#34;, ISM-5526 will release a large wave of abnormal energy, destroying all technological devices (presumably due to the biological components), and all materials considered edible within 50 meters. What is considered &#34;edible&#34; includes all plant matter, fungi, solutions containing glucose, and all animals not within the genus //Simia//. During these events, ISM-5526 will attempt to escape securement and attack any personnel. ISM-5526 will not enter its &#34;Famine State&#34; again within --48-- 24 hours after its last &#34;Famine State&#34;.

**History:** ISM-5526 was first discovered on 7-23-8384 when a large temporal-spacial disturbance occurred in Dome-19 [[footnote]] The largest of the Organization&#39;s Bio-Domes, designed to harbor members of //Simia solis// and provide a simulated environment catered for their needs. [[/footnote]].  Mobile Task Force Kilo-13 (&#34;Dawn Patrol&#34;) [[footnote]] An MTF dealing with abnormalities within the Bio-Domes, specifical ones with a large //Simia solis// population.[[/footnote]]. went to investigate the abnormality. The following transcript is from a video taken off of  K-13 Bravo&#39;s body camera.

++ Personnel

**K-13 Alpha:**  Nokak Mawwar, Captain
**K-13 Bravo:**  Thera Sonnenblume, Thuergist
**K-13 Charlie:** Jocro Voikukka, Tracker and Field Medic
**K-13 Delta:** Amana Caléndula, Combat Expert

**[Begin Log: 18:67]**

**Alpha:** Ok people, comms are up, look alive. Our sensors show that the abnormality occurred in the northwest quadrant. Let&#39;s move out.

//[K-13 Alpha enters the Bio-Dome, with the rest of Kilo-13 following.]//

//[K-13 proceeds to advance through a large forest before reaching a clearing. Approxamently 50 meters in, a large metal rod sticks out of the ground. All plant life in the clearing is completely withered away, and several animal corpses are visible from Beta&#39;s camera.]//

**Delta:** What in Hel happened here?

**Alpha:** That pole seems to be the source of the abnormality. Delta, with me. Let&#39;s advance and make sure it&#39;s safe.

//[K-13 Alpha and K-13 Delta enter the clearing, weapons drawn. After a short sweep, both determine the area to be clear.]//

**Alpha:** Charlie, take a sample of the pole. HQ will probably want it. 

//[K-13 Charlie advances to the rod and removes a piece.]//[[footnote]]Testing determined the rod to be similar to Organization Alloy 332 &#34;Berillium Bronze&#34;[[/footnote]]

**Bravo:** There seems to be a strong Theurgic signature in that direction. 

//[K-13 Bravo points to the east]//

**Alpha:** Alright, Charlie you lead. See if whatever it was left a physical trail.

//[K-13 advances to the east, with K-13 Charlie in the lead.]//

**Charlie:** Found a footprint! Looks like a Sunling [[footnote]]Slang for //Simia sollis//[[/footnote]] left it.

**Alpha:** Could mean nothing, this area&#39;s full of them. Still, keep your eyes open. 

//[The team resumes advances for approximately 15 minutes before K-13 Charlie raises his hand.]//

//[K-13 Charlie gives the hand signal for &#34;Sound Detected&#34; and waves K-13 Alpha and K-13 Delta to the front.]//

//[K-13 Alpha gives the signals for &#34;3&#34;, &#34;2&#34;, and &#34;1&#34;, before running forward.]//

//[ISM-5526 is laying on the ground, unconscious.]//

**Bravo:** That&#39;s it. 

**Alpha:** //[Picks up ISM-5526 and carries it over her shoulder.]// Alright, let&#39;s move out.

**Addendum 5526-1:** Shortly after ISM-5526&#39;s recovery and containment, it entered a &#34;Famine State&#34; and breached containment. The entity was quickly recovered and the current Intermediate Security Measures were enacted. ISM-5526 was originally believed to be non-sentient, however, during a standard feeding, ISM-5526 made an attempt to contact personnel. The following interview was performed shortly afterward via the use of an Omni-Translator.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Interviewer:** Researcher Aulot Tanpopo, Ph.D.
**Subject:** ISM-5526

-----

**[Begin Log 7:21]**

//[ISM-5526 is seated behind a high-resilience transparent screen. Dr. Tanpopo is located on the other side.]//

**Dr. Tanpopo:** This is Doctor Tanpopo, interviewing ISM-5526 on 8-2-8384. 

//[Dr. Tanpopo turns on the Omni-Translator.]//

**Dr. Tanpopo:** Hello. Can you hear me?

**ISM-5526:** Ye... yes.

**Dr. Tanpopo:** I am Dr. Tanpopo, and I represent the ISM Organization.

**ISM-5526:** Wh.. what&#39;s that?

**Dr. Tanpopo:** We are an organization dedicated to the containment of the abnormal and the protection of the Simian race. You are ISM-5526, one of those abnormal things. 

**ISM-5526:** I am?

**Dr. Tanpopo:** Yes. Do you have another name you would like us to call you?

**ISM-5526:** Uh... no. I ... don&#39;t remember much of anything. 

**Dr. Tanpopo:** What do you remember?

**ISM-5526:** I remember ... a room. A small room. I was... trapped in it.  And then a v... voice.

**Dr. Tanpopo:** What did it say?

**ISM-5526:** &#34;Goodbye&#34;
