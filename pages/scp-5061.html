[[include component:image-block name=16475061385_c5bf23d815_b.jpg|caption=SCP-5061, outside of its protective casing.]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5061 is to be stored inside Area-179&#39;s Secure Media Archive.[[footnote]] Kept according to standard film preservation protocols. [[/footnote]] 
 
Access to SCP-5061 is limited to the researcher assigned to Project-5061-Telephone. Interaction is to be carried out once every 24 hours for the purpose of collecting information regarding SCP-5061 and Entity-5061-1, and all interaction is to be recorded.[[footnote]] See Project-5061-Telephone logs below. [[/footnote]]

**Description:** SCP-5061 is a 35 mm film reel encased in an unlabeled container. SCP-5061 holds approximately 305 m of film[[footnote]] The standard for a 35 mm reel. [[/footnote]]- all of which is blank. 
 
Despite holding the equivalent of 11 minutes worth of film, SCP-5061 will run indefinitely when played. Upon projection, SCP-5061 displays the image of a dressing room, in which Entity-5061-1 will be present. From information provided by SCP-5061-A, this dressing room is located on the set of the 1942 Warner Brothers production //Yankee Doodle Dandy//. SCP-5061 can be projected once every 24 hours. Attempting to play SCP-5061 after stopping the projector will result in a blank screen. This will continue until the 24 hour period between projections is over. 

Entity-5061-1 is a young woman that is present during projections of SCP-5061. The entity can be interacted with by those viewing SCP-5061, and has given no indication of anomalous origin or intent. Entity-5061-1 refers to itself as &#39;Elizabeth Connors&#39;, and has provided a mass of information regarding itself and the nature of SCP-5061. No such name appears in the credits for //Yankee Doodle Dandy//, nor does the likeness of Entity-5061-1 appear in any known cut of the film. Search of records from various acting agencies and studio archives from the era to match the likeness and description of Entity-5061-1 is ongoing.

Information provided by Entity-5061-1 and upon acquisition of the object[[footnote]] See Addendum-5061.1: Acquisition. [[/footnote]] indicates that projecting SCP-5061 acts as a conduit between two separate points in time- one in the present, and one in 1942. Because of the viewpoint provided through projection and references by Entity-5061-1 itself, it is known that Entity-5061-1 can &#39;see&#39; its viewers through its dressing room mirror. Regardless of what time SCP-5061 is successfully projected,[[footnote]] Within the 24 hour cool-down period. [[/footnote]] Entity-5061-1 will always perceive the event as occurring around 20:00.

**Addendum 5061.1:** Acquisition
 
SCP-5061 was acquired by MTF Mu-3 (&#34;Highest Bidders&#34;) from an auction held by [http://www.scp-wiki.net/marshall-carter-and-dark-hub Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd.] on 5/10/2020. An excerpt from the bidder&#39;s guide is displayed below.

||~ Status||Selling||
||~ Demand||High||
||~ Value||85000USD||
||~ Availability||Unique||
||~ Identifier||The Woman in the Reel||
||~ Description||A film reel that- when played- accesses a window to the past- specifically, the dressing room of a 1940s actress by the name of Elizabeth Connors. The viewer is able to interact with Elizabeth, and vice-versa. Elizabeth is able to be talked to once every 24 hours for an indefinite amount of time, or- at least until she has other things to do. To cease interaction, simply turn the projector off, and remove the reel. ||

**Addendum 5061.2:** Project-5061-Telephone

In order to gain information about and to thoroughly investigate SCP-5061, Project-5061-Telephone was established and assigned to a sole researcher- Dr. Edward Dune. Transcripts of Dr. Dune&#39;s logs are listed below.

**Project-5061-Telephone.5/11/2020 Video Log Transcript**

**Date:** 5/11/2020

**Subject:** Entity-5061-1

**Interviewer:** Dr. Edward Dune- Senior Researcher, Area-179

**Foreword:** Project-5061-Telephone interactions are conducted in Area-179&#39;s Media Viewing Theater. Per written request of Dr. Dune, protective glass separating the screen and the viewer has been removed. 

**Note- Dr. Dune:** //My eyesight&#39;s bad enough without the annoying glare. I seriously doubt MCD would sell an item without informing bidders that there&#39;s a risk something&#39;s going to jump out of the screen and kill you. Actually- I wouldn&#39;t put it past them. Whatever. Remove the glass. If anything happens, I could probably deal with it anyway. - Dr. Edward Dune//
-----

**&lt;Begin Recording&gt;**

//&lt;The image of Entity-5061-1 removing cosmetics is projected onto the screen&gt;//

**Dr. Dune:** This is Doctor Edward D-

**Entity-5061-1:** //&lt;subject yells in surprise&gt;// Jesus Christ- not again! You know, I was getting used to not having strange men stare at me in my dressing room.

**Dr. Dune:** You can hear, correct?

**Entity-5061-1:** Oh, he&#39;s British. Yes, I&#39;m able to hear you. I can see you too, you know.

**Dr. Dune:** Figured. I&#39;m assuming you prefer &#39;Elizabeth&#39;?

**Entity-5061-1:** It&#39;s my God-given name, sir. And you haven&#39;t even introduced yourself!

**Dr. Dune:** Right, right- Doctor Edward Dune. I&#39;ll be talking to you for the next couple of days. Is this alright with you?
 
**Entity-5061-1:** I suppose I don&#39;t have much of a choice, do I?

**Dr. Dune:** You don&#39;t. Let&#39;s start with s-

**Entity-5061-1:** Questions, right? Always questioning. Questioning me, treating me like I&#39;m thick- &#34;Can you leave the room? What day is it?&#34;- Yes, I can leave the room! I&#39;m as real as- well, as real as I think you are.

**Dr. Dune:** Wasn&#39;t doubting your existence, Elizabeth. I&#39;d just like to ask you some questions.

**Entity-5061-1:** How about I ask you some questions?

**Dr. Dune:** That&#39;d be sufficient.

**Entity-5061-1:** Sufficient. You&#39;re quite distinguished, aren&#39;t you, Doctor? Just, answer me this- are you, or, all of you people- oh- it&#39;s ridiculous. I couldn&#39;t-//&lt;sobbing&gt;//

**Dr. Dune:** Fucking Christ. Calm down. Look, look- the &#39;why&#39; behind our communication is just as much of a mystery to me as it is to you, but that&#39;s not important. I need to figure out what you are, exactly-

**Entity-5061-1:** What I am? What are you talking about, sir? T-

**Dr. Dune:** What year is it, Elizabeth?

**Entity-5061-1:** Year?

**Dr. Dune:** I&#39;ll approach it this way. For me, it&#39;s 2020.

**Entity-5061-1:** You&#39;re insane. What do you mean? No, I thought about this- and, oh God. You&#39;re government, right? It has to be government. I&#39;m an experiment, aren&#39;t I? Men from the future, and- oh, it&#39;s just ridiculous! 

**Dr. Dune:** Why don&#39;t you try to tell me about yourself, or where you are? Just, close your eyes and tell me about yourself. Things that are true to you. If you&#39;re in distress, we&#39;d be able to help, Elizabeth.

**Entity-5061-1:** Distress? Heavens n- um, okay, I&#39;ll try. My name is- uh, Elizabeth Connors. I&#39;m an actress, or at least- that&#39;s what people say. It&#39;s bit roles and extra work, mostly. I&#39;m not a Barrymore, or a Stanwyck, but I- I like what I do. The cameras, meeting new people- it&#39;s pleasant- when the work&#39;s there, of course. My uncle&#39;s a producer- Oh! I think I&#39;m getting ahead of myself.

**Dr. Dune:** You&#39;re doing fine, Elizabeth.

//&lt;pause&gt;//

**Entity-5061-1:** It&#39;s okay, sir. I&#39;m not as fat-headed as I may look. I&#39;ve been thinking about it for awhile, and, well- you&#39;re from the future. You said it yourself. They&#39;ve all said it. I&#39;m accepting it. For me- it&#39;s January 3rd, 1941. For you, it&#39;s two-thousand and-?

**Dr. Dune:** Twenty.

**Entity-5061-1:** Heavens. 
 
//&lt;pause&gt;//
 
**Entity-5061-1:** You seem a little more talkative than the others.

**Dr. Dune:** How many people have you talked to? 

**Entity-5061-1:** Just a few. Asked me all sorts of strange questions. I was doing my hair, and then all of a sudden four men were in my mirror. Gave me quite a shock, sir. They were always brief- came around for only a couple minutes a night. 

**Dr. Dune:** Mirror, huh? Ah, that makes sense.

**Entity-5061-1:** It only happened for a week or so, right around the middle of December. Same time every night, right around 8 o&#39;clock. I thought I was going mad! Eventually, I just accepted it. At first, I wanted to talk to a doctor, and- oh, well- I guess I&#39;m talking to one now.

//&lt;Dune writes on his notepad&gt;//

**Dr. Dune:** Shit works out, doesn&#39;t it?

**Entity-5061-1:** //&lt;gasping&gt;// You&#39;re a vulgar doctor, too- talking like that to a woman! I presume manners and a professionalism aren&#39;t a staple of the scientific community in 2020, either.

**Dr. Dune:** Hmm? Oh, sorry.

**Entity-5061-1:** //&lt;laughing&gt;// I&#39;m playing with you, sir. If you heard the things I hear everyday on set, your ears might fall off.

**Dr. Dune:** I doubt that. So, can you-

**Entity-5061-1:** You&#39;re not going to be much fun either, are you?

**Dr. Dune:** Probably not. I&#39;m here to study you, Elizabeth. Your compliance makes this a lot easier. The sooner you answer my questions, the sooner you won&#39;t have to deal with strange men in your mirror.

**Entity-5061-1:** Well, you haven&#39;t been asking me much, sir. You don&#39;t have to be so rude when ta-

**Dr. Dune:** Alright, that&#39;s enough for tonight. Think about what I said. I have papers to revise. We&#39;ll be talking daily.

**Entity-5061-1:** Joy.

**Dr. Dune:** Hold on- I have to get up- reel&#39;s still in.

**Entity-5061-1:** What?

//&lt;Dr. Dune leaves his chair and moves towards the projector&gt;//

**Dr. Dune:** Nothing, don&#39;t worry about it.

**Project-5061-Telephone.5/12/2020 Video Log Transcript**

**Date:** 5/12/2020

**Subject:** Entity-5061-1

**Interviewer:** Dr. Edward Dune- Senior Researcher, Area-179
-----
**&lt;Begin Recording&gt;**

//&lt;The image of Entity-5061-1 is projected onto the screen&gt;//

**Dr. Dune:** Elizabeth?

**Entity-5061-1:** Right on time.

**Dr. Dune:** Hm. Do you remember what time we talked yesterday?

**Entity-5061-1:** Around eight?

**Dr. Dune:** What time is it now? Exactly?

**Entity-5061-1:** //&lt;glancing to the right&gt;// 7:55.

**Dr. Dune:** Interesting. 

//&lt;Dune writes on his notepad&gt;//

**Entity-5061-1:** Why?

**Dr. Dune:** Observations. More for me than you.

**Entity-5061-1:** Why are you studying me, Doctor?

**Dr. Dune:** I said before, we&#39;re studying the means of communication between us. You just happen to be on the other end.
 
**Entity-5061-1:** But you&#39;re still studying me- taking notes and all.

**Dr. Dune:** What kind of researcher would I be if I didn&#39;t?

**Entity-5061-1:** Who are you?

**Dr. Dune:** Doctor E-

**Entity-5061-1:** Edward Dune, right. You work for the government, the military- something of the sort?

**Dr. Dune:** You could say that. I work for an organization that investigates things that aren&#39;t...normal. Right now, it&#39;s the way we&#39;re communicating. We study these things, keep them out of the wrong hands- allow the masses to spend their time watching films, or enjoy a day in the park. There&#39;s a veil of normalcy that has to be kept, and we&#39;re the ones in charge of keeping it.
 
**Entity-5061-1:** Well, you&#39;re quite important.

**Dr. Dune:** Very. 

//&lt;Dune writes on his notepad&gt;//

**Entity-5061-1:** No time for film, or a day in the park, or being kind when you&#39;re responsible for protecting the world from God knows what, right?

**Dr. Dune:** Not really. Anyways, can you tell me a bit about your everyday routine?

**Entity-5061-1:** What is wrong with you? It&#39;s like you&#39;ve never talked to another person before! You&#39;re rude, sir. 

**Dr. Dune:** Alright, fine. I&#39;ll...I&#39;ll stop. I need to know about the nature of your world.

**Entity-5061-1:** The nature of my world? How about the nature of yours, sir? I&#39;m not quite sure what you want from me. You&#39;re from the future, right? Just go look up 1942 in an encyclopedia if you&#39;re so curious about the nature of my world!

**Dr. Dune:** It isn&#39;t like that-

**Entity-5061-1:** Well, what is it like? Keeping secrets doesn&#39;t help anyone.

**Dr. Dune:** Fine- I have to figure out whether your 1942 and my 1942 are the same, or if we&#39;re looking at something more complex.

**Entity-5061-1:** What do you mean, &#34;my&#34; 1942? What kind of talk is that?

**Dr. Dune:** The kind of talk we specialize in, Elizabeth. Why don&#39;t you list off some significant events that have happened recently?

**Entity-5061-1:** Well, I&#39;m not one for politics- but even I know the United States just entered the war.

**Dr. Dune:** I assumed from the accent, but you are in the United States- right?

**Entity-5061-1:** Burbank, California. 

**Dr. Dune:** Do you know what prompted the entry into the war?

**Entity-5061-1:** Why, of course! Everyone knows that. The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor just last month.

**Dr. Dune:** That&#39;s good, Elizabeth. Means there&#39;s a possibility that we&#39;re operating on the same timeline, or a similar one, at least.

**Entity-5061-1:** Oh, right. Good.

//&lt;Dune writes on his notepad&gt;//

**Entity-5061-1:** Look, I understand that conversation isn&#39;t exactly your thing, so why don&#39;t I take the wheel?

**Dr. Dune:** It&#39;s not th-

**Entity-5061-1:** Just relax. Forget about the paperwork, or whatever you have to do after this. Let&#39;s just talk. If you&#39;re from the future, and- well, if we&#39;re on the same brainwave, or whatever you said- can you tell me what happens? With, uh, the war and all.

**Dr. Dune:** Well, It&#39;s not exactly protocol for interacting with time anomalies, but I think you can keep a secret, right?

**Entity-5061-1:** I never kiss and tell, sir.

**Dr. Dune:** I&#39;m speaking English, aren&#39;t I?

//&lt;Entity-5061-1 smiles and holds its hands to its mouth&gt;//

**Entity-5061-1:** No. I didn&#39;t even thi-

**Dr. Dune:** Mhm. 

**Entity-5061-1:** That&#39;s wonderful! I- I felt guilty about doing all of this, when the world&#39;s in chaos, and people are struggling- and I&#39;m just here- dancing, singing, smiling. There&#39;s a war out there, and all I can do is play pretend.

**Dr. Dune:** Rosie the Riveter a thing yet?

**Entity-5061-1:** Who?

**Dr. Dune:** Oh, you just wait. No, Elizabeth- don&#39;t feel guilty. There&#39;s a saying where I&#39;m from- about dying in the darkness, so others can live in the light. You&#39;re living in the light, Elizabeth. There&#39;s nothing wrong with that. World needs a little light sometimes.

**Entity-5061-1:** //&lt;sighing&gt;// Right. I suppose making people smile is a noble goal.

**Dr. Dune:** You&#39;re taking their minds off of what&#39;s going on out there. What you&#39;re doing is important. People like you- they&#39;re needed.
 
**Entity-5061-1:** Thank you, sir. I just felt-

**Dr. Dune:** Don&#39;t. Look, I&#39;m sorry. In my line of work, I deal with a lot of inhumanity, literally and emotionally. Usually when I&#39;m communicating with something- it&#39;s planting a memetic trigger in my cornea, or lashing out at me. I just wasn&#39;t sure-

**Entity-5061-1:** It&#39;s okay, sir. You didn&#39;t know if I was safe to talk to, or if I was a real person. I understand.

**Dr. Dune:** It&#39;s the reality of the job. I should&#39;ve approached you more humanely. I realize you have hopes, fears, and you&#39;re undoubtedly living a life of your own. 

**Entity-5061-1:** You&#39;re fine. Why don&#39;t we just talk? You can get your information, and I can have someone to talk to this late at night.

**Dr. Dune:** That&#39;d be su- that&#39;d be fine.

//&lt;pause&gt;//

**Dr. Dune:** You said you&#39;re on a movie set, right?

**Entity-5061-1:** Mhm, a Warner Brothers production. If that means anything to you.

**Dr. Dune:** Warner Brothers? Oh, Elizabeth- it does. They&#39;re still as big of a studio now as they were back then. 
 
**Entity-5061-1:** Heavens! Really?

**Dr. Dune:** Of course. What&#39;s the movie? One of those gangster ones?

**Entity-5061-1:** Oh, it&#39;s not a crime film. It&#39;s a musical- //Yankee Doodle Dandy//.

**Dr. Dune:** Yankee Doodle? I think I&#39;ve heard of that one before. I don&#39;t really have time for-

**Entity-5061-1:** //&lt;gasping&gt;// Really? I&#39;m in a popular musical in the future! 

**Dr. Dune:** Well, I wouldn&#39;t say popular.

**Entity-5061-1:** You&#39;ve heard of it.

**Dr. Dune:** I&#39;ve heard of a lot of movies, doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ve seen them.

**Entity-5061-1:** //&lt;laughing&gt;// You are so bitter.

**Dr. Dune:** Hard not to be when you&#39;re in my position.

**Entity-5061-1:** Oh please, I have to deal with Mr. Curtiz on a daily basis. You&#39;re just like him! You&#39;re on a deadline to get something done, so everyone else has to suffer.

**Dr. Dune:** I do not make people suffe-

**Entity-5061-1:** Why&#39;d you get so short with me back there, hm, Mr. Curtiz?

**Dr. Dune:** I already apologized! It wasn&#39;t right.

**Entity-5061-1:** Mmm, I&#39;m not convinced.

**Dr. Dune:** //&lt;laughing&gt;// I apologize, Elizabeth. I deal with my fair share of assholes above me, too. I don&#39;t want to be another asshole above you.

**Entity-5061-1:** //&lt;laughing&gt;// He is a bit of an- uh-

**Dr. Dune:** A what?

**Entity-5061-1:** An asshole. //&lt;laughing&gt;// I&#39;m so sorry, I just- //&lt;laughing&gt;// I try not to talk like that.

**Dr. Dune:** If the man&#39;s an asshole, the man&#39;s an asshole- simple as that.

**Entity-5061-1:**  //&lt;laughing&gt;// That&#39;s so bad! It&#39;s true though. We&#39;ve been reshooting the same scene for the past week or so. A dance number. You&#39;d think we&#39;d have never danced in our lives from the way he talks to us. And don&#39;t even ask me about Joan- that bitch- the Prima Donna herself. 

**Dr. Dune:** &#39;That bitch&#39;? //&lt;laughing&gt;// You&#39;ll have to tell me about her.

**Entity-5061-1:** Oh, I think I will, sir. Tomorrow night. We&#39;re doing another shoot at 10 o&#39;clock sharp, and it&#39;s one of her scenes. But, I think I&#39;ll be getting to bed now, if you don&#39;t mind.

**Dr. Dune:** No problem at all, Elizabeth- we got some good info from this one. 

**Entity-5061-1:** And?

**Dr. Dune:** And?

**Entity-5061-1:** You had a pleasant conversation.

**Dr. Dune:** Yeah. I did. Thank you. Sorry about being a dick to you, yeah? 

**Entity-5061-1:** It&#39;s okay. You&#39;re kind, when you want to be.

**Dr. Dune:** Now, don&#39;t say that. //&lt;laughing&gt;// Get some rest.

//&lt;Dune gets out of his seat to turn off the projector&gt;//

**Entity-5061-1:** Wait, sir. I have another question.

**Dr. Dune:** //&lt;Dune steps away from the projector and gestures&gt;// Shoot.

**Entity-5061-1:** Is it all worth it? This, I mean- Elizabeth Connors. Does that name mean anything to you?

//&lt;pause&gt;//

**Dr. Dune:** Yes, it does.

//&lt;Entity-5061-1 smiles and nods. Dune stops the projector and faces the camera.&gt;//

**Dr. Dune:** Elizabeth Connors.

//&lt;Entity-5061-1 is displayed onscreen&gt;//

**Entity-5061-1:** Doctor.

**Dr. Dune:** Well? 

**Entity-5061-1:** //&lt;subject jumps up from its chair&gt;// I got into the audition!

**Dr. Dune:** Holy shit! I knew you had it in you!

**Entity-5061-1:** I talked to Mr. Zedder and he said he liked mine the best! I- I didn&#39;t even think I could get in, but-

**Dr. Dune:** That&#39;s fucking great, Liz. No, really. You earned this one, girl.

**Entity-5061-1:** A Universal picture! Doctor, could you imagine me- headlining a Universal picture? Ah, heavens- I could just see it!

**Dr. Dune:** Of course I can! You&#39;re a natural. That script you did last night? Top notch.

**Entity-5061-1:** Ah! I&#39;m so happy!

**Dr. Dune:** Good thing I came prepared!

//&lt;Dr. Dune brandishes a bottle of wine, pops the cap, and begins drinking. He gestures towards the screen.&gt;//

**Dr. Dune:** Drink up.

**Entity-5061-1:** Directly from the bottle, doctor?

**Dr. Dune:** Not like I&#39;m sharing it with anyone. 

**Entity-5061-1:** You&#39;re sharing it with me.

**Dr. Dune:** Hmm, in a way. So, I was thinking- if you do get this role, or- hell, whenever this production&#39;s over and you move out of the dressing room- how are we going to talk?

**Entity-5061-1:** I, uh, never thought of that. I mean, I wouldn&#39;t mind staying here. It&#39;s not like I have anywhere else, and I&#39;m already paying rent, and-

**Dr. Dune:** You know you can&#39;t do that.

**Entity-5061-1:** You&#39;re right. I guess I&#39;ll just have to buy the dresser itself. 

**Dr. Dune:** With what money?

**Entity-5061-1:** Can&#39;t your Foundation anonymously wire some back in time? 

**Dr. Dune:** //&lt;laughing&gt;// Anomalously. And no, don&#39;t think we have one of those yet.

**Entity-5061-1:** How am I supposed to know? You talk about pictures that kill you, and portals to other worlds- but you don&#39;t have a way to drop pennies from heaven?

**Dr. Dune:** There&#39;s a Foundation back in your time, you know. You should find them. //&lt;laughing&gt;// Maybe they&#39;ll pay for the dresser. I&#39;m sure they&#39;d love to interact with a future version of their little pet project. Oh God, that&#39;d be terrible. Please don&#39;t do that, Liz. 

**Entity-5061-1:** Wasn&#39;t planning on it. Besides, I wouldn&#39;t even know where to find you people.

**Dr. Dune:** Oh, we&#39;re around. More common than you think.

**Entity-5061-1:** Do you like what you do?

//&lt;pause&gt;//

**Dr. Dune:** No. No, Liz. I don&#39;t.

**Entity-5061-1:** If you don&#39;t want to talk about it-

**Dr. Dune:** It&#39;s fine. I figured we&#39;d cross this bridge eventually.

**Entity-5061-1:** Really, doctor- I apologize for asking.

**Dr. Dune:** Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t come to the Foundation by choice. It&#39;s family work, in a line of business that death is particularly fond of. You&#39;re always left with more questions than answers, and sometimes you go looking for those answers. What you come back with isn&#39;t always what you wanted. I&#39;m rambling- sorry.

**Entity-5061-1:** Why don&#39;t you leave?

**Dr. Dune:** I can&#39;t. They want me. Easier to watch me this way. I leave, I end up just like you- a number and a file to be catalogued and stored in the archive. But I&#39;m a useful bastard, and I do my job well enough that the Foundation benefits from keeping me around. 

**Entity-5061-1:** Why would they catalogue you? What&#39;s there to study?

**Dr. Dune:** I&#39;d rather not talk about it. 

//&lt;pause&gt;//

**Dr. Dune:** This project isn&#39;t so bad, though. Talking to you. It&#39;s nice to just unwind. Doesn&#39;t even feel like work anymore.

**Entity-5061-1:** I enjoy it too. Must be a break from the rest of the, um, shit that you put up with on a daily basis.

**Dr. Dune:** That&#39;s not very proper of you, isn&#39;t it, Liz?

**Entity-5061-1:** Been talking to you too much. //&lt;laughing&gt;//

**Dr. Dune:** No lab assistants who don&#39;t know how to clean equipment, no junior staff fighting for my approval, nothing&#39;s actively trying to kill me- it&#39;s almost- normal. Funny- that is- normal for me being talking to someone who could be my great grandmother. 

**Entity-5061-1:** I might be.

**Dr. Dune:** No, you don&#39;t have the Dune ugliness. It&#39;s our signature trait. Can&#39;t get into the family without it.

**Entity-5061-1:** Don&#39;t think I don&#39;t know where you&#39;re going with this, doctor. You&#39;re calling me beautiful. I&#39;ve been sweet-talked before, and no amount of walking that back is going to save you.

**Dr. Dune:** //&lt;laughing&gt;// Don&#39;t flirt with me, Liz- I&#39;m supposed to be researching you.

**Entity-5061-1:** Oh, we&#39;re back to the research stage now?

**Dr. Dune:** We never left it, Liz. 
 
//&lt;pause&gt;// 
 
**Dr. Dune:** Maybe in another time.

**Entity-5061-1:** Well- what should time have to do with anything? You&#39;re in my life every single day! We&#39;re real to each other. Why does it matter where we are. I still see you, and hear you, and-

**Dr. Dune:** Liz, in my timeline, you&#39;re dead. I&#39;m communicating with you, and that might be affecting the past, but you&#39;re dead. 

**Entity-5061-1:** But every time you talk to me, I&#39;m alive. 

**Dr. Dune:** You know it wouldn&#39;t work.

**Entity-5061-1:** //&lt;tearing up&gt;// I know. But it would&#39;ve. I want to know about your world, I want to know about you. Be there for you. You have no one, doctor. 

**Dr. Dune:** I have you, and you&#39;re doing a fine job at keeping me sane.

//&lt;Entity-5061-1 places its hand against its mirror&gt;//

**Entity-5061-1:** I can&#39;t touch you. Oh, God- I can&#39;t touch you. //&lt;crying&gt;// What did I do to deserve this? I can&#39;t even touch you.

**Dr. Dune:** It&#39;s alright, Liz. It&#39;s okay. Just breathe. You can see me, can&#39;t you? You said it yourself- I&#39;m real. You&#39;re real. We&#39;re talking- sharing things about our day, our hopes for the future. This time shit&#39;s just an obstacle we&#39;ll have to deal with. No use dwelling on it. 

//&lt;Entity-5061-1 wipes its tears with a tissue&gt;//

**Entity-5061-1:** Okay.

**Dr. Dune:** I&#39;m not going to turn the projector off. I&#39;ll stay with you as long as you&#39;d like. It hurts me too.

**Entity-5061-1:** You&#39;re a good comforter, doctor. Better than you think.

**Dr. Dune:** Maybe I am.

//&lt;pause&gt;//

**Dr. Dune:** It&#39;s late.

**Entity-5061-1:** I think you should stay.

**Dr. Dune:** I think so too.

//&lt;pause&gt;//

**Entity-5061-1:** Goodnight, doctor.

**Dr. Dune:** You can call me Edward if you want.

**Entity-5061-1:** Goodnight, Edward.

**Dr. Dune:** Goodnight, Elizabeth.

//&lt;The image of Entity-5061-1 is projected onto the screen.&gt;//

**Entity-5061-1:** Edward?

**Dr. Dune:** Hey.

**Entity-5061-1:** I got the notice.

**Dr. Dune:** Last week?

**Entity-5061-1:** Mr. Curtiz thinks so.

**Dr. Dune:** Oh.

**Entity-5061-1:** All of my scenes are shot, too. I shouldn&#39;t even be here.

**Dr. Dune:** You rented it out for the month, right?

**Entity-5061-1:** Months almost up.

**Dr. Dune:** Shit. Did you talk to your uncle?

**Entity-5061-1:** Hasn&#39;t gotten back to me. He&#39;ll get me extra work, no problem- but a place to stay? That&#39;s on me.

**Dr. Dune:** I...There&#39;s nothing I can do, really. Huh.

**Entity-5061-1:** It&#39;s not your place.

**Dr. Dune:** Your uncle- he keeps his distance, eh?

**Entity-5061-1:** Wasn&#39;t always like that. I guess he never got over me being a failed child actor.

**Dr. Dune:** That long, huh?

**Entity-5061-1:** Oh, it was fine in the silents. It was like playing charades. As soon as talkies came around, they realized I couldn&#39;t act- and, they just regulated me to extra work. 

**Dr. Dune:** You can dance, though.

**Entity-5061-1:** Charades, like I said.

**Dr. Dune:** Get any word back from Zedder? He might be able to get you a place to stay.

**Entity-5061-1:** Nothing yet. Funny- he said I&#39;ll know by the end of the month. Don&#39;t worry yourself, Edward. My uncle&#39;s soft enough to let me stay a couple nights to get back on my feet.

**Dr. Dune:** I&#39;m sure he will, and if he doesn&#39;t- just bring him to me. I&#39;ll tell him I&#39;m God, or something.

**Entity-5061-1:** //&lt;laughing&gt;// I still have another week. Worry about it when we get there, right?

**Dr. Dune:** Right.

**Entity-5061-1:** Are you good?

**Dr. Dune:** I&#39;m fine, Liz. Been a rough day.

**Entity-5061-1:** What happened?

**Dr. Dune:** Director&#39;s breathing down my neck about outdated files and improperly formatted junior test logs. It&#39;s like they know nothing about writing a research paper. I mean, jesus, we&#39;re talking about kids right out of school, here. Should be fresh in their brains!

**Entity-5061-1:** Oh, well- I agree! Fresh in their brains! //&lt;laughing&gt;//

**Dr. Dune:** He loves me. Good &#39;ol Roman. He&#39;ll see this, too. Hi Roman, you incompetent piece of shit! //&lt;laughing&gt;//

**Entity-5061-1:** He lets you talk like that?

**Dr. Dune:** Liz, he needs me. I mean, how else would this place keep itself together?

**Entity-5061-1:** I&#39;m just making sure, I&#39;d hate to see you let go.

**Dr. Dune:** Imagine that. You might get Doctor Crouch.

**Entity-5061-1:** Is he the foreigner? 

 **Dr. Dune:** He&#39;s the space alien.

**Entity-5061-1:** //&lt;laughing&gt;// I don&#39;t think I&#39;d like him very much. 

 **Dr. Dune:** I&#39;m not going anywhere, Liz. You don&#39;t have to worry.

**Entity-5061-1:** Okay. I just-

 **Dr. Dune:** What?

**Entity-5061-1:** I&#39;m getting used to this.

 **Dr. Dune:** What&#39;s wrong with that?

**Entity-5061-1:** You were right, Edward. Maybe in another time.

 **Dr. Dune:** Maybe. Hey, how&#39;s your memory?

**Entity-5061-1:** Why?

 **Dr. Dune:** Thinking of something. Can you list off everything you&#39;ve been in?

**Entity-5061-1:** Uh, I think so. My first film was a silent, obviously, 1928- I believe?

//&lt;Entity-5061-1 is projected onto the screen&gt;//

**Entity-5061-1:** Hello, Edward! I thought I wouldn&#39;t make it tonight, but- here I am.

 **Dr. Dune:** You&#39;re still taking down the set?

**Entity-5061-1:** It&#39;s almost done, but, yeah. It&#39;s a lot of work.

**Dr. Dune:**  I&#39;m sure. Last day, right?

**Entity-5061-1:** Last day. Everyone left a couple hours ago. It&#39;s just me and a couple stragglers.

**Dr. Dune:** So-

**Entity-5061-1:** I have until tomorrow. Then I either call back Mr. Zedder, or my uncle, or-

**Dr. Dune:** Why not ask Sandra? You said she was willing to-

**Entity-5061-1:** I&#39;m not taking handouts. I barely kno-

**Dr. Dune:** It&#39;s not a handout, it&#39;s a matter of you having a place to stay-

**Entity-5061-1:** Edward, it&#39;ll work out, okay? Do you know why?

//&lt;pause&gt;//

**Entity-5061-1:** I bought the dresser! I talked to Wilson and he said they were getting new ones in just next month.

**Dr. Dune:** Seriously? That&#39;s amazing! We-

**Entity-5061-1:** We&#39;ll be able to talk! Isn&#39;t that just wonderful?

**Dr. Dune:** Even if you&#39;re living in a box by next week- at least you&#39;ll have a nice dresser!

**Entity-5061-1:** //&lt;laughing&gt;// Oh, don&#39;t say that! I&#39;ll be fine.

**Dr. Dune:** I have no doubt in my mind. Uh, I have some news too. Remember those department certifications we were going through this week?

**Entity-5061-1:** Today was the last day, right? Did you pass?

**Dr. Dune:** Flying colors. I talked to the inspection team for about seven hours just wrapping things up, but we passed. Area-179 is a top of the line Foundation installation. 

**Entity-5061-1:** Heavens, that&#39;s wonderful!

**Dr. Dune:** Proud of myself. Hell, I&#39;m even proud of Roman. Kept it together pretty well for the suits. You know what kept me going this whole week?

**Entity-5061-1:** Oh, stop. Don&#39;t even go there. //&lt;laughing&gt;//

**Dr. Dune:** It&#39;s true, Liz. It&#39;s cathartic- this.

**Entity-5061-1:** I tend to have that effect on people.

//&lt;Dune lights a cigarette&gt;//

**Dr. Dune:** Should be required for working in this shithole.

**Entity-5061-1:** I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to talk to that many people. //&lt;laughing&gt;//

**Dr. Dune:** Ah, you&#39;d manage.

//&lt;pause&gt;//

**Entity-5061-1:** Edward, what exactly have you concluded from studying me?

**Dr. Dune:** That you&#39;re a bright, beautiful young woman who has a promising career ahead of her?

**Entity-5061-1:** How flattering. I&#39;m serious.

**Dr. Dune:** To be honest with you, not much. Thing just works. No anomalous residue, no memetic effects- it&#39;s just a window in time, and you&#39;re on the other side of it.

**Entity-5061-1:** What about me? You asked about my previous work. Why?

**Dr. Dune:** Well, I can&#39;t exactly disclose that information, Liz.

**Entity-5061-1:** Why not? You already told me that we win the war, why can&#39;t you tell me about myself?

**Dr. Dune:** Think about it this way, if I told you- all the shock would be gone, eh?

**Entity-5061-1:** Oh, I suppose you&#39;re right. I won&#39;t push it further.

**Dr. Dune:** Besides, we&#39;re playing with time, Liz. If I told you, it might not happen that way in actuality. Get it?

**Entity-5061-1:** I do. I don&#39;t like it, but I understand. You have your reasons for doing what you do.

**Dr. Dune:** Yeah. Right. 

//&lt;pause&gt;//

//&lt;phone ringing&gt;//

**Dr. Dune:** For you?

**Entity-5061-1:** It&#39;s a bit late. Hello? Yes, this is she. Oh. Well, thank you for informing me. Tomorrow? Yes, that&#39;d be perfect. Mary, right. Thank you. 

//&lt;pause&gt;//

**Dr. Dune:** What was that?

**Entity-5061-1:** //&lt;screaming&gt;// Yes! Yes! Yes! I got it! It was Mr. Zedder&#39;s secretary! I got a part in the Universal picture! A lead!

**Dr. Dune:** A lead?

**Entity-5061-1:** Yes! A lead! I got a lead role! Out of everyone who auditioned- they picked me! Heavens, isn&#39;t that amazing? 

**Dr. Dune:** Yeah, that&#39;s....amazing. Liz, what did you say the name of the film was?

**Entity-5061-1:** Something like, //He&#39;s My Guy//? I believe that&#39;s it, yes. Why?

**Dr. Dune:** It&#39;s nothing. Data collection, yeah? I&#39;m proud of you, Liz! You earned it.

**Entity-5061-1:** She said I could come out tomorrow for a production meeting! Mr. Zedder wants to see me again! 

//&lt;pause&gt;//

**Entity-5061-1:** What&#39;s wrong, Edward? This is wonderful!

**Dr. Dune:** Of course it is! I was preoccupied, sorry about that! I was just thinking about the certification tests. Mind&#39;s still not off it. //&lt;laughing&gt;// How about I go break out the drink, huh?

**Entity-5061-1:** Oh, alright! I&#39;ll get mine!

//&lt;Dune leaves the theater&gt;//

//&lt;pause&gt;//

//&lt;Dune returns with a bottle of wine&gt;//

**Dr. Dune:** A toast to Elizabeth Connors- a brilliant actress.

**Entity-5061-1:** Cheers! //&lt;laughing&gt;//

//&lt;The image of Entity-5061-1 is projected onto the screen. Subject is clearly in a state of distress.&gt;//

**Dr. Dune:** Liz?

**Entity-5061-1:** Edward? Edward, I&#39;m scared.

**Dr. Dune:** What&#39;s going on, Liz? Are you okay?

**Entity-5061-1:** I...I stuck around, just to talk to you. They&#39;re moving everyone out of the area, but I stuck around.

**Dr. Dune:** What&#39;s happening? Who&#39;s moving people? Liz, you need to talk to me!

//&lt;loud noises from outside the dressing room&gt;//

**Entity-5061-1:** //&lt;crying&gt;// Edward, you said we win. Why would you say that-

**Dr. Dune:** Elizabeth, you need to talk to me. You need to tell me what&#39;s going on immediately.
 
**Entity-5061-1:** //&lt;distressed&gt;// They&#39;re bombing the city. Edward- they&#39;re bombing the city! The Japanese, oh my God, Edward. They&#39;re outside! I-

**Dr. Dune:** No, no, no, no, no, fuck-

**Entity-5061-1:** Edward, please tell me we win- Edward. What&#39;s wrong, Edward? Why-

**Dr. Dune:** Shit. God-fucking-damnit, Liz. I...I&#39;m sorry. Liz, I&#39;m sorry. I lied to you, Liz. I fucking knew it. Shit, it makes sense now.

**Entity-5061-1:** What&#39;s going on? Edward, please. Tell me we win, Edward! What do you mean you lied?

**Dr. Dune:** I asked you, about your films, all those nights ago. Remember that, Liz? Remember when I asked you that?

**Entity-5061-1:** Oh my God-

**Dr. Dune:** Fuck. I should&#39;ve told you. I should&#39;ve fucking told you. I-

**Entity-5061-1:** Told me what? Edward, please!

**Dr. Dune:** //&lt;screaming&gt;// I did my research, Liz. I looked. I looked online, I even watched half of the damn things. You&#39;re not credited once. Not a single goddamn time. 

**Entity-5061-1:** What the hell does that mean? I was certainly cre-

//&lt;loud noises from outside the dressing room&gt;//

**Entity-5061-1:** //&lt;screaming&gt;// Edward? What do you mean, Edward?

**Dr. Dune:** This reel. The way we&#39;re communicating. God, I&#39;m a fucking idiot. It&#39;s not a window in time. It&#39;s another dimension. God-

**Entity-5061-1:** Wh-

**Dr. Dune:** Your 1942 isn&#39;t my 1942, Liz. It&#39;s obvious now. Fucking Christ, the Japanese never attacked Burbank, California. That never happened. They don&#39;t attack shit! No one does! We drop a fucking bomb on them and it&#39;s over. 

//&lt;Dune throws a chair&gt;//

**Entity-5061-1:** Does that mean, oh my God, Edward-

**Dr. Dune:** Yes, it&#39;s an alternate timeline. Anything can happen. You can lose, Liz. You can lose.

**Entity-5061-1:** Oh my god, wh- what am I going to do, Edward?

**Dr. Dune:** Why do you think I was so disturbed last night? There&#39;s no Elizabeth Connors in //He&#39;s My Guy//. //&lt;shouting&gt;// There&#39;s no fucking Elizabeth Connors in anything, let alone a lead role. You don&#39;t fucking exist. There&#39;s nothing. 

**Entity-5061-1:** //&lt;distressed&gt;// W-Why didn&#39;t you tell me? Edward, why didn&#39;t you tell me? Why did you lie to me? 

**Dr. Dune:** Because I didn&#39;t know for sure! Last night confirmed it. You were happy. What was I supposed to fucking do? You could make something of yourself, Liz. Timelines diverge. You can be a star! Why would I fucking tell you that you don&#39;t exist? Can&#39;t you think?

**Entity-5061-1:** Edward-

**Dr. Dune:** //&lt;distressed&gt;// No, Liz. You need to get the fuck out of Burbank, now. If they&#39;re evacuating, you fucking join them. No, I don&#39;t know if you win. Fuck, I don&#39;t know anything. But I don&#39;t know if you lose, either. You have a life to live ahead of you. Just fucking leave! Go!

**Entity-5061-1:** I&#39;m staying with you.
