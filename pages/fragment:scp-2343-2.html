**Item #:** SCP-2343

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2343 is to be housed in a modified humanoid containment cell at [http://www.scp-wiki.net/secure-facility-dossier-site-88 Site-88]. SCP-2343&#39;s containment cell is to utilize an active Scranton Reality Anchor with a redundant power backup.

A copy of these containment procedures shall be kept on file at Site-88 and Site-19. Once a day those documents are to be compared with this document for any discrepancies. A discrepancy between any copy of these containment procedures should be reported to SCP-2343&#39;s project director.

**Description:** SCP-2343 is a humanoid entity roughly 2.2 meters tall and weighing 62 kg. SCP-2343 is considered a Class I reality altering entity. SCP-2343 is not actively hostile.

SCP-2343 appears as an individual in his late 40s or early 50s. Despite this apparent age, SCP-2343 has displayed a physical fitness roughly analogous to an individual in his early 20s. SCP-2343 has not shown any signs of aging since confinement in 2005.

In 2005, police were called to a domestic disturbance in Germantown, Tennessee [[footnote]] A suburb of Memphis, Tennessee.[[/footnote]]. Once on site, the police gave conflicting reports relating to the subject of the complaint. An individual identifying as Peter Panepi made several claims as to his abilities while at the same time suffering from the signs of a physical assault. 

While the responding officers eventually took the subject into custody due to public intoxication, embedded Foundation assets relayed the claims of the subject. A routine interview with the subject was scheduled by Foundation assets on August 4th, 2005.

&gt; ++ Pre-Recovery Interview
&gt; 
&gt; **Date and Time:** August 4th, 2005 at 13:25
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Agent Goodman
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** POI-5602 (//Later classified as SCP-2343//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Location:** Holding Room C of the Germantown Police Department.
&gt; 
&gt; +++ Transcript:
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Goodman:** Hello. I&#39;m your court appointed psychologist.
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-5602:** Right. You smoke?
&gt; 
&gt; //POI-5602 politely offers Agent Goodman a cigarette.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Goodman:** I&#39;m trying to quit.
&gt; 
&gt; //POI-5602 uses a lighter to light his cigarette, and smokes it throughout the remainder of the interview.//
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-5602:**  Look, I get a little mouthy when I&#39;m drunk. I think they said I threatened to unmake the world or something.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Goodman:** Yes. You made some claims about your wife as well?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-5602:** She&#39;s a hellcat. Half the time she don&#39;t know what she&#39;s doing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Goodman:** What led to the incident that made you call 911?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-5602:** Honestly, I don&#39;t even remember. I was drunk, I was playing my guitar and she didn&#39;t like it. You ever heard of Tom T. Hall?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Goodman:** I haven&#39;t.
&gt; 
&gt; //POI-5602 produces a guitar from under the table and begins to tune it.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Goodman:** Where did that come from?
&gt; 
&gt;  **POI-5602:** The guards here know I play a little, so they get me a guitar whenever I&#39;m locked up. You got time to listen to a song?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Goodman:** I don&#39;t, actually. I have a couple of other prisoners to talk to today. But I will be back by before the end of the day.
&gt; 
&gt;  **POI-5602:** Alright then. Don&#39;t be a stranger.

Subject was searched prior to and following the interview. The guitar produced during the interview was not found in either search. Following this interview a reality anchor was requisitioned from a nearby Foundation garrison to prevent further minor actualization incidents. Before deployment, SCP-2343 escaped custody.

The Foundation, in preparation for the possibility of escape, had created several reality anchored zones in and around Memphis, Tennessee, including the subject&#39;s place of work and home. A single reality anchor was found to be capable of suppressing SCP-2343&#39;s natural abilities. Capture, transportation and storage of SCP-2343 at Site-88 was completed on September 9th, 2005.

Capture of SCP-2343&#39;s immediate family, including the object&#39;s wife [[footnote]]Identified at the county registrar&#39;s office as Sacha Panepi.[[/footnote]] was not achieved during this time. Acquiring SCP-2343&#39;s cooperation in the capture of its wife [[footnote]]Designated POI-5701.[[/footnote]] is a top priority. [[/collapsible]]

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2343/offset/2 + Listen up you sideways assholes][[size 0px]][[footnote]]Following the massive loss of life resulting from Incident 2343-15, attempts to capture POI-5701 are to be temporarily halted.[[/footnote]][[/size]][[size 0px]][[footnote]]Cooperation between POI-5701 and GOI-13 is ongoing. It is theorized that capture of POI-5701 may be facilitated by further inroads with GOI-13.[[/footnote]][[/size]]</textarea></pre>
