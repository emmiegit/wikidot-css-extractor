//One afternoon, at a fashionable clubhouse belonging to Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd.//

&#34;Look what //I// made!&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s lovely, sir. You are truly gifted. May I ask what it is?&#34;

&#34;I made it using the kit that I bought from you guys last year, and the tools that you sold to my friend a few years back before his accident! And the wood came from trees on [[[scp-476|that secret island in the secret lake that I had to rent the map from you guys for]]], and—&#34;

&#34;Fascinating, sir. But… what //is// it?&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s a reverse mirror voodoo puppet!&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m sorry, sir, a what?&#34;

&#34;Reverse mirror voodoo doll stick puppet!&#34;

&#34;A mirror voodoo—&#34;

&#34;REVERSE mirror!&#34;

&#34;But, sir, a mirror //already//... yes, sir. A reverse mirror voodoo doll stick puppet. Very impressive. You are a true artist.&#34;

&#34;Yeah! So what&#39;ll you give me for it?&#34;

&#34;… I beg your pardon?&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m selling it to you! What&#39;ll you give me for it!&#34;

&#34;I, uh, sir, I... I&#39;m not authorized to make purchases on behalf of my employer, sir. I&#39;ll need to speak to my supervisor.&#34;

&#34;Sure, you do that. This little baby oughta go for eight, maybe nine million?&#34;

&#34;Uh. Sir, I… please realize that the prices for which we //sell// items are not the prices we //pay// for items, and— &#34;

&#34;Yeah, yeah, I gotcha. So… eighty, ninety grand?&#34;

&#34;Sir, really, I&#39;m not authorized to make purchases on behalf of— sir, what does the reverse mirror voodoo doll stick puppet even //do//?&#34;

&#34;Pick it up.&#34;

&#34;Uh…&#34;

&#34;No, take it out of the towel. Let it touch your skin!&#34;

&#34;Sir, I am a client interaction representative, not a test subject. If you wish to purchase a human test subject for demonstration purposes, that can be arranged as a separate transaction.&#34;

------

//Eleven years later//

&#34;Uh, yeah, hi, I was wondering... uh... did... did anyone bid on my puppet this time?&#34;

&#34;As a matter of fact, sir, they didn&#39;t even get the chance!&#34;

&#34;...what?&#34;

&#34;Before the auction could even start, the SCP Foundation raided the site, and they //[[[SCP-841|stole your puppet!]]]//&#34;

&#34;... REALLY?!?!?&#34;</textarea></pre>
