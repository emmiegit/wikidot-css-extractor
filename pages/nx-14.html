**Nexus Interaction Protocol:** Due to its geographical location and anomalous properties, no additional cover-up is necessary. Contact with Nx-14 will be carried out through Site-14, respecting the agreements with the Nexus&#39; native population. Furthermore, Site-14 will be in charge of monitoring any kind of instability and/or abnormality originating from Nx-14. 

Site-14 was built at the entrance to a cave system in the Guiana Shield, providing the Foundation&#39;s only authorized access point to Nx-14. Expedition schedules are as follows and entry to Nx-14 is prohibited apart from these dates, unless otherwise noted: 

* 03/01/2014
* 15/03/2014
* 30/10/2014

Expeditions are still being organized for upcoming years. Any attempt external to the Foundation to make contact with Nx-14 must be prevented, and its inhabitants must be notified. 


**Containment Facility:** Site-14.

**Description:** Nx-14 is the designation given to various zones of the lithosphere beneath the Guiana Shield. The closest documented zone to the surface is located 40 km underground, being the first to be studied by the Foundation. Nx-14 runs for several kilometers in the lithosphere[[footnote]]According to the dynamic model of Earth&#39;s structure.[[/footnote]]and is delimited by the Mohorovičić discontinuity, with several isolated zones that are not necessarily connected in a conventional way. Due to the depth and additional anomalous measurements of Nx-14, access is only possible with the help its native population. 

Nx-14 comprises several ecosystems inhabited mainly by a Muridae[[footnote]]Family of rodents of the Myomorpha suborder.[[/footnote]] species, named //Rattus abissos//. or its common name, &#34;abyssal rodents&#34;; they possess the following autapomorphies that distinguish them from other known rodent species: intelligence and opposable thumbs on their forelimbs. Other characteristics are the presence of sexual dimorphism, with males being larger than females, and having more colorful fur; a prehensile tail[[footnote]]An animal&#39;s tail with a biological adaptation that allows it to grasp or hold objects.[[/footnote]] and the ability to learn thaumaturgy[[footnote]]This ability is not innate to the species.[[/footnote]]. 

The political organization of //Rattus abissos// is based on a group called &#34;Attitiudi Hana&#34;, which consists of 8 individuals (4 males and 4 females) for each large inhabited area, who are responsible for making decisions and maintaining order as well as compliance with certain laws, such as regulating transportation of individuals between inhabited areas. Additionally, they have a population control defined by mating seasons throughout the year. It has not been possible to confirm all the major populated areas, but it has been indicated that there are 8 total states.

Research on the biological aspects of Nx-14 and its inhabitants is being carried out by Dr. Pedro Estrada from the Biology Department. After the initial studies, it has been proposed to extend the research to different departments in order to understand in greater depth various aspects of Nx-14.

+ Summary

Research into //R. Abissos//¸ also called &#34;abyssal rodents&#34;, began in the mid-twentieth century, following the Foundation&#39;s first attempts to communicate with Nx-14. Although we knew of their existence, it was not until the end of the 1990s that we were able to make contact with their inhabitants, allowing us to learn about different aspects of this species native to the lithosphere of the Guiana Shield.  

In 2013 an agreement was reached whereby I would be allowed to travel to Nx-14&#39;s areas accompanied by a local, named Norvelio. This study focused on understanding Nx-14&#39;s ecosystem in order to perform a threat assessment and analysis of future collaborations with its inhabitants. Research was mainly done regarding their agricultural methods, culture and history.

++ First direct contact with inhabitants of Nx-14

After finishing construction of Site-14, we went into a system of caves until we came across a stone inscription made by the abyssal rodents. As we came into contact with it, several cracks appeared in the cave walls, transporting us directly to the first area of Nx-14. Our sensors and the Checkpoint indicated that we had descended approximately 40 km instantaneously. It was not necessary to wear special suits due to the measurements collected by drones, which showed no difference between the average environmental characteristics of the surface compared to Nx-14.

The first ones to greet us were a group of three rodents about the size of a person. We could hear several squeaks coming from this group, until one of them stood in front of us and seemed to be able to communicate through its squeaks. He explained to us that he knew a method to communicate with any being that had a sensory system based on mechanical waves, although he still produced squeaks like the other rodents in the group, in our minds we could hear his voice clearly; it was subsequently discovered that in the video records he was only heard with a human voice.

&gt;  
&gt; **Foreword:** Among the 3 rodents involved, only one is able to communicate with us, identifying himself as &#34;Norvelio&#34;. This member of the species is believed to have different knowledge and anomalous abilities; Norvelio is a male specimen, with white fur and brown spots, his tail has several tattoos and glyphs. The other two rodents are smaller, with gray fur, and carry lamps that emit a green light capable of illuminating the cave. On the ceiling were several geometrical shapes in symmetrical patterns of green and blue colors.   
&gt; -----
&gt; **(Begin Log)**
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** After all this time, we can finally meet. As far as I can see, we both came prepared in case it was necessary to confront each other, didn&#39;t we? 
&gt;  
&gt; //(Norvelio points his tail at the two armed agents and the other two rodents, who did not appear to have any kind of weapon; then he lets out a short, sharp laugh..)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** Thank goodness it&#39;s not that way, I&#39;m too old of a rat to get into any fights. Forgive my enthusiasm, as I have omitted the introductions. I am Norvelio, from the area closest to the surface. Unfortunately my companions cannot introduce themselves.... Nor would they like to, they still have their doubts about your species, if that is not evident by their faces. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Z-9 Maximiliano:** Is that rat speaking English? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** Ahem, I can understand you as well. And not exactly, you could say I&#39;m a kind of anthropologist, but my method of communication is a bit complex to explain, summing up in a conversion of my own sounds to your language. I don&#39;t speak any human language, but all humans can understand me... //(Pause.)// I&#39;m already getting away from the main topic, it is of my interest to meet the first members of the Foundation who came to meet our species, you know, to meet the people behind those messages in the last years. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** We are a team of three members, and I am a researcher of anomalous species-   
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** Forgive me for interrupting, but we can spare the titles on this occasion. Your organization has already provided us with that information, and that is why you were accepted in our lands. Only a casual introduction is necessary, you know, for a better communication.   
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** Well, if that&#39;s all, I&#39;m Pedro Estrada and this is my research team. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Z-9 Juárez:** My name is Juárez and it is amazing to see you first-hand. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Z-9 Maximiliano:** I am Maximiliano, and I did not expect this to be so casual. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** Oh, it&#39;s no casual thing at all. The amount of agreements and messages between my command and yours was a headache for all these years. So I would prefer to take this opportunity more calmly. Anyway, once finished with the introductions, your presence is no longer necessary, colleagues. 
&gt; 
&gt; //(The other two rodents look at Norvelio and produce a unison shriek, then clap their hands and an armor of crystalline characteristics appears on their skin, partially covering their bodies. After that, they proceed to burrow and disappear into the ground without leaving any marks.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** They are really rather heartless and straightforward. Well then, we can continue, follow me, the path to our destination is this way. Our small entrance is not fair to the view that awaits us. 
&gt; 
&gt; //(Norvelio turns around and places his hands on the floor, wagging his tail in a circular pattern, as the geometric shapes on the ceiling begin to light up and spread across the walls of the cave. An opening is made in front of Norvelio, revealing a panorama of the area.)//
&gt; 
&gt; //(At first sight a large area can be seen delimited by the roof of a cave full of stalactites, which are covered with minerals capable of illuminating the different structures built by the abyssal rodents. Rivers of green magma can be seen flowing around the periphery of the area, flowing calmly. There is also a small lake in the center, where small boats can be found.)//
&gt; 
&gt;  **Norvelio:** I am sorry if this is the most I can offer you at this time. First of all, the agreements only allow me to show you one of our recently built cities. Secondly, it is not one of the more developed areas, for the same reason, so it still looks somewhat rustic. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** That is not a problem, we had already been warned about the type of interaction and the limitations of our expedition. Discussions are still ongoing to allow more freedom for us. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Z-9 Juárez:** Besides having a very good view of the city from this point, although very restricted. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Z-9 Maximiliano:** After all, this is a very basic mission, isn&#39;t it? We just came to confirm your lack of hostility and verify the parameters of the site. As far as I am concerned, Estrada, Juárez and I will make accurate measurements with our equipment in this place. It will take us between 30 minutes and an hour. You might want to talk further with this local resident.  
&gt; 
&gt;  **Norvelio:** I wish you luck with your measurements, although it is common to have the same environmental and atmospheric conditions that you are used to. We are very similar organisms to some extent. 
&gt; 
&gt; //(Z-9 Juárez and Z-9 Maximiliano set up the measuring and scanning equipment in the background. Norvelio stays with P. Estrada.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** So, Norvelio, you are not a common member of your species, right? Speaking of authority and capabilities. 
&gt; 
&gt;  **Norvelio:** Just like you are not just any member of yours. Not anyone can stand in front of an opportunity like this without making mistakes. But you&#39;re right, this old rodent&#39;s road to get to this point has been long and complicated. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** I figured, mostly because of all those tattoos on your tail, although it&#39;s not my specialty, I can recognize your thaumaturgical origins. Speaking of origins, you mentioned earlier that we are similar, what exactly were you referring to? 
&gt; 
&gt;  **Norvelio:** I see that we have begun with the fundamental questions. Let&#39;s start with the &#34;intelligence&#34; of our species, it is clearly analogous, there is no common ancestor among our species to whom it was a feature. Even so, it opened doors for us and broke the limitations imposed by instinct. This simple conversation is not a coincidence, two evolutionary paths to the same answer. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** While that explains some of your behavior and accomplishments, it still doesn&#39;t cover why you went so deep into our planet. Could only advanced magic have accomplished something like this? 
&gt; 
&gt;  **Norvelio:** By no means. Several factors have brought us this far. On the tactical side, the continental shields are a perfect choice because of their low orogenic activity - billions of years and these rock plates remain in one piece. Moving on to a more personal section, what is the reason for your visit or interest in this place? And don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s just a matter of work, your sharp look gives it away. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** In a world where most anomalous organisms tend to be hostile, it is a relief to find a more benevolent one. Deep down, my passion is to learn about the ecosystems of this nexus, as well as some unique aspects of its species. 
&gt; 
&gt;  **Norvelio:** A spirit of inquiry, sounds perfect to me. While your colleagues finish their task, you can take more insights about the city from here. Take a look.  
&gt; 
&gt; //(Norvelio takes a piece of glass from a wall, and with his fingernails he makes a small mark on the material.)//
&gt; 
&gt;  **Norvelio:** I have given properties of a magnifying glass to this small mineral. Now it has a capacity similar to a pair of binoculars and will allow you to see the city in a better way. 
&gt; 
&gt; //(During the next 38 minutes the team performs their tasks. Norvelio is seen eating some minerals from the cave during this period of time.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Z-9 Maximiliano:** Well, we have finished with our measurements and now have the required samples. It&#39;s time for us to go back to the surface. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** That was quick. I will then arrange your return trip. Hope to see you again in a few months. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** Same here, Norvelio. Thank you for welcoming us to your nexus. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** Gratitude goes to you, for coming in peace and harmony..

++ Paraminerals 

One of the pillars of the culture of //R. Abissos// focuses on the handling of minerals and mineraloids by using thaumaturgy, this being called paramineralogy. The most common way of transforming common minerals into an anomalous state is through polymorphism and polymorphic phases giving them different properties. 

While polymorphic phases depend on temperature and pressure, a third factor is involved in this process, whereby the molecular structure of the mineral must first be modified in a specific way before a certain amount of EVE is applied to it. If the process is carried out correctly, the mineral will gain anomalous properties ranging from increased hardness and luster to ectoentropic and metamorphic capabilities, among others. Its main use is in clothing, tools and foodstuffs.

&gt; **Location:** First area of Nx-14 - Minerals Section 
&gt; 
&gt; **Date:** 15/03/2014
&gt; 
&gt; **Assigned Department:** Department of Biology; member: Pedro Estrada (P. Estrada).
&gt;  
&gt; **Foreword:** Once past the first section, Dr. Estrada and Norvelio walked through a cave, illuminated by blue and yellow crystals on its walls, for 15 minutes until they reached a more open place where several giant minerals in different patterns (tabular, prismatic, acicular, botroidal) are found, some glowing on their own while others reflect light. 
&gt; -----
&gt; **(Begin Log)**
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** What do you think of this place? Surely it must remind you of some kind of mine or a similar place. It is one of my personal work places, here I dedicate myself to create new paraminerals. 
&gt;  
&gt; **P. Estrada:** It certainly looks like a mine, although all those crystals have some very extravagant shapes that I had not seen before. And how is it possible to have such an intense glow coming from some crystals? Where do they get the energy for it? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** There are two ways to accomplish this. As you may know, some organisms are bioluminescent, such as protists, so you just have to find a way to introduce them into the crystal and then they simply feed on small portions of the crystal. In the end, the light produced is amplified by the properties of the crystal. Remember the lamps from last time? That&#39;s how they work. Sure, I&#39;m oversimplifying and skipping over certain aspects, but you can take some samples with you to analyze.  
&gt;  
&gt; **P. Estrada:** That would be very kind of you, thank you. And... What&#39;s the second way? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** I was just waiting for that question, although there is no better way to demonstrate it than with an example. //(Norvelio picks up a small crystal from the floor with his tail.)// One of the most plentiful minerals on the planet and very simple at first glance, quartz. Now if I may, give me a few moments to give it a stellar glow. 
&gt; 
&gt; //(Norvelio moves his tail in a circular pattern at different speeds for 3 minutes. After that, he places the quartz in his hands and scratches the crystal with his fingernail to trace a geometric pattern, which suddenly disappears once it is completed.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** And in three, two, one... //(Some kind of high-pitched squeak is heard; the quartz begins to emit a white light.)// And that&#39;s the second way. It&#39;s a little less complex process depending on your point of view. Although unfortunately not everyone has the ability to handle life energy at that level. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** An interesting skill in any case, and what other applications have these paraminerals been used for? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** Oh, it is quite a business due to the difficulty of finding mineral casters. There are those who spend their lives inventing and innovating the manipulation of the visible spectrum. I just showed you the simplest alteration of all. With enough knowledge and practice you can create true wonders, such as projection of entire images, even with sound! And remember, that&#39;s just the visual side, there are many more, such as food, clothing, entertainment and so on. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** And since when do you all use this knowledge? I suppose that if it&#39;s something very old it must be very developed.. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** It has been a long time, but like any scientific aspect, we have come to stagnate in certain limitations. For example, 5 years ago the idea of a paramineral capable of opening portals to transport you from one area to another in an instant was unthinkable. Yes, the process is still being refined, but nothing serious has happened. That&#39;s one of my current works, a bit more complicated per se... And when I say a bit, it&#39;s actually a lot. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** And why is that? Apparently you&#39;ve been trying a lot of different base minerals. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** For now it will be a surprise, but be sure you will know the answer in the future. In the meantime, wouldn&#39;t you like to try to practice with simple things? 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** I appreciate the invitation, but I must decline. I have no practical knowledge in the use of thaumaturgy and I doubt I have the time or resources to change that. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** Oh, that&#39;s a shame. If at any time you change your mind, don&#39;t hesitate to let me know.. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** Thanks once again. One last fundamental doubt about these paraminerals, do they also have applications in the weaponry field? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** A part of me would like to answer you with a definitive &#34;no&#34;. I mean, you can split an atom in half and with that you can deal with most problems. Even so, this art has also been stained with the presence of war, yes. But can anyone blame us? Our world is not one of complete peace and if we were to fall behind, we would only be left with the path of extinction. I apologize for not being so accurate with my answer, I just wish it were different. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** I see no need to apologize. And I thank you for this opportunity to know a little of this aspect of your people, it has left me surprised. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** The pleasure has been mine. Remember, feel free to come down and practice if you wish, it never hurts to learn a new skill that could be extremely useful.

[[include :scp-sandbox-3:image-zoom name=http://lafundacionscp.wdfiles.com/local--files/nx-14/patronNx14.jpg|caption= Figure 2. Crop pattern.|width=300px|align=right]]

Due to the lack of the main source of energy in terrestrial ecosystems —sunlight-—, abyssal rodents use advanced geothermal energy sources, canalizing and transmitting heat through patterns such as the one presented in Figure 2. Also, the main crops are macroscopic fungi belonging to the Basidiomycota division; these fungi have been modified to survive and fulfill their life cycle solely based on the heat provided by geothermal energy, without the need to resort to other food sources. However, they can still fulfill their degradative function. 

Additionally, the crop pattern can be altered to modify the biological structure of the fungi, being able to be transmuted into different minerals containing large amounts of EVE. //R. Abissos// does not have the innate ability to degrade inorganic compounds through their digestive system, this ability is possible due to reciprocal relationships with different prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) native at that level of the lithosphere. These prokaryotes are found in the digestive tract of //R. Abissos//. These microorganisms are anomalous, since they can convert heat into EVE through yet unknown metabolic pathways, thus being able to degrade certain inorganic compounds.

&gt;  
&gt; **Foreword:** Once past the mining area visited in the 15/03/2014 expedition, a path leading to irregular steps is found, further down, it is possible to observe the growth of mushrooms of various colors, and mold. It is worth noting the size of these mushrooms being over 3 meters high in some cases. 
&gt; -----
&gt; **(Begin Log)**
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** So, how have you been doing with the analysis of the minerals you collected last time? I&#39;m sure that&#39;s been keeping you a bit busy. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** We have handed the samples to several departments, and while it is possible to understand the method used for the modifications and we can replicate it to some extent, we still don&#39;t understand the ease with which you did it. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** You are on the right track, that&#39;s the important thing. Leaving that issue aside, how do you like the view in front of your eyes? 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** Are these really mushrooms? Their shapes are similar to some surface species, but their colors, and especially their sizes, are very different. How is it possible for them to grow so much in an environment devoid of nutrient-rich soil? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** At first glance that&#39;s true, but look under your feet, don&#39;t you notice something different? 
&gt; 
&gt; //(Norvelio uses his tail to remove some soil, revealing jade-colored lines with a bit of a shine.)// 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** That right there is only a small part of the whole pattern that sustains fungi.  
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** So these mushrooms are still sustained by &#34;magic&#34;? I thought you had found a less eccentric way for your agricultural activities. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** And you are correct in that, the rootstock is indeed a thaumaturgic work, but not to supply them in that way. It only serves to canalize the geothermal energy of the Earth and help the fungal cells. Depending on the skill of the farmer a variety of fungi can be created, with different functions. I&#39;ve seen that your gaze has landed on those crystals sticking out of the fungus&#39; &#34;hat&#34;. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** Apart from its extravagant appearance, I am curious to know how is it possible to grow minerals exactly in that part. I can&#39;t understand their adaptive or reproductive function... That reminds me of a question I had forgotten to ask last time, do you eat those anomalous minerals? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** You just linked the two subjects - certain members of our people are able to cultivate and eat mycominerals. Since centuries ago, in our childhood we consume a cocktail of commensal bacteria capable of degrading these anomalous minerals in our digestive tract... But extreme care must be taken in carrying out such a practice, or you may over stimulate these bacteria, causing an untreatable and deadly bacterial infection. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** And is it worth the risk? Apart from the fact that the process to obtain this food is not at all simple. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** If something isn&#39;t really a risk, it&#39;s definitely not worth it. Mycominerals have the ability to give you enough energy to not depend on water and other foods for months to years, or even decades. That is one of their main functions, others confer temporary or permanent anomalous capabilities, it all depends on the type of fungus grown. Speaking of that disease and as a good researcher, you must be eager to examine in detail a member of our species? 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** That&#39;s a very spontaneous question, and not something I would ask that way considering the implications. Although it would be very helpful to our research. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** That&#39;s a very elaborate way of saying &#34;yes&#34;. You see, a few days ago a poor homeless thief managed to get to my crop and inadvertently ate a mycomineral without due precautions, causing his death. I wouldn&#39;t want his body to simply function as compost and if it can be of any help to you, all the better. Don&#39;t worry about a biohazard either, the disease is not transmissible. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** Your hospitality and empathy surprises me, so much it makes me ask, why? Why are you willing to explain all this to us in detail? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** I am eager to answer you, but the farm is not the best place for it. Would you like to join me at one of my households? There it is, around that crimson fungus. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** Alright, let&#39;s go. 
&gt; 
&gt; //(They both walk through the crop until they find a circular entrance decorated with stones and metals. Norvelio opens the door by placing his two hands in front of it and tracing several glyphs with his index finger. Upon entering, several green lamps can be seen on the floor, and a purple one on the ceiling. Several beige scrolls are seen lying on the floor, along with a small hole in the center of the room where there is a quartz crystal.)//  
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** Forgive me if I&#39;ve not had time to clear my home, and if you see little footsteps. Yesterday I brought in a small young litter to teach them about fungus history and cultivation. You could say I&#39;m a professor of some sort. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** Considering your knowledge, you could be a teacher to anyone on the surface. Now, what is the sudden reason for contacting us? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** It&#39;s because here is not really that much difference between our species, we have our mages, threats, cultures and hundreds of other things. I know you have not seen the actual cities of our people, but that is because we are diverse, just as the human diversified in the continents, our species did the same expanding throughout this Shield. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** Is that all it is? That enthusiasm of yours indicates at least a greater intent, or perhaps concern. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** If you had the opportunity to open the way for future generations to a better future, would you try? I cannot decide overnight to make us part of the human world, what I can do is to introduce us in the best possible way: cooperation, trust, solidarity. My people are too distant from yours and vice versa, we do not seek to return nor do we need to. Still, at some point we will come into close contact and I would like to start as soon as possible, one step at a time. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** Something like a better chance of survival, right? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** It is not about survival, it is to coexist peacefully with human beings. We are both inhabitants of the same world and we must take care of it together; when it comes to face the evils that concern us since ancient times, or the emerging ones, we will be ready to confront them, not as humans nor as rodents, but as the embodiment of life belonging to our Earth. 
&gt;

&gt; -----
&gt; **Notes:** After evaluation of Dr. Estrada&#39;s request to bring the body of the rodent mentioned in the log, it was accepted, and that same week a team recovered the body without major difficulties.

++ Additional Expedition, 25/12/2014

On 24/12/2014 a message was received from Nx-14, requesting an expedition outside the established schedule. On this date, slight seismic changes coming from the asthenosphere were detected, with epicenters coming from all the geological shields of the planet.

&gt; **(Begin Log)**
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** During our first encounter you asked me, why did we go to the depths of the Earth? And I actually rambled a bit, because I didn&#39;t feel confident yet to tell you the truth. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** So you lied with all that stuff about intelligence and so on? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** Oh, no, not at all, the only thing that lies achieve is to weaken honor and friendship. Of course it was a very basic answer, with intelligence we understood our situation. Before we go on, are you really willing to unveil our past? Because it is a delicate subject in several aspects. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** Sure, all these years I&#39;ve been looking for that answer, haven&#39;t we made progress in all these years of expeditions? 
&gt; 
&gt; //(Norvelio puts his tail on the ground, wagging it in a slow serpentine fashion.)// 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** It is true, your words and actions confirm what I have always thought about you. Let&#39;s go back to the subject. We understood that we were afraid of the world. What were we in the ancient times of our species? A bunch of rats in a land full of extraordinary beings: the appearance of the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1000 children of the night], **##green|the puzzling forgotten lands##**, the empires of metal, flesh and blood... The list goes on and on, it was clear that at some point we were going to encounter one of these great empires, and do you know what my ancestors did? 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** Escape to these subterranean places? But how?
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** Of course we would have done that, except that we had no idea about such advanced magic. We had the intelligence of an average human being, no tricks to rely on, no machines to operate, no gods to pray to. We began to hide in caves, thinking to look for natural shelters. We were truly hopeless and doomed, maybe with luck we would have gone extinct, but, oh, those empires were as cruel as their wars. 
&gt; 
&gt; Do you remember the first time you came here with your team? I know it seems like a deviation from the topic, but it&#39;s not. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** I remember how some inscriptions appeared on a stone and then we were transported to the meeting point. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** Exactly, those inscriptions and transportation methods were taught to our people in those primitive times. There is a story about a female hermit, one of the first to live totally in the caves and from one day to the next. She told us about the existence of entities belonging to the ground and its depths. We call them the Burial Worms, but they are not really worms at all, they are bodiless beings, moving freely throughout the lithosphere. 
&gt; 
&gt; At the time we considered them the salvation of our people, as they helped us settle in this place and provided us with the basic knowledge to forge our future. However, their presence so close to the surface was an evil omen. Remember all those groups I mentioned a few moments ago? 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** While they are not my specialty, I know some beings from those groups. Or at least the main thing about each, if you mean the Daevites, Mekhanites and so on. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** Oh, those are certainly interesting names for those beings, although I sense it is more of a linguistic convenience rather than a real name. Anyway, during millions of years such imposing societies arose and then, one by one, they rotted away until they are almost forgotten today, or hidden in the most remote places of the planet. 
&gt; 
&gt; For far too long I attributed these downfalls to completely independent processes, unconnected to each other. But after searching throughout my life, I found a change in the... soul of the planet? I wouldn&#39;t know how to put it into words. The last relevant change was the... Quaternary mass extinction, and I...
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** Are you alright? Suddenly I could only hear your normal squeals.
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** Forgive me, the knowledge I gained is too shocking for this old rodent. From that point in history, a force that I still do not fully understand influenced in one way or another the fall of life on Earth. The advantage of living so deep allowed me to find not dozens, but hundreds of remains belonging to eras already forgotten by the surface. So much beauty lost in just moments for no apparent reason, it is terrifying just to think about that mere fact. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** Are you talking about a god or something? An archaic organism from the past?
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** There is no worse feeling than uncertainty, and I hate to say it, but I don&#39;t know, my old friend. It could be a god, at least some of my kind call it that. I for one do not recognize it as a divine entity. We know that the Worms are some sort of descendant of that... I&#39;ll take the liberty of calling it an entity, although it could be anything else, an event or an element. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** If you don&#39;t know what it is, how do you know of its existence? There must be some proof if you are telling me this. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** Don&#39;t rush yet, my comrade. Although we planned to escape with the Worms, an event forced us to accelerate that process. Our species ruled what is now Central America and the northern part of South America, and during the weeks of the... The moment that entity began to awaken, a tragic event occurred. The mouths consumed so many, no matter what they were, buried alive from one instant to the next. We lost more than half the population in a few days. We understood that the Worms could fight off the entity and we escaped. Can you give me a moment? My explanations are becoming less and less precise. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** No problem, take as much time as you need. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** I&#39;ll go for a silver crystal, those tend to cheer me up. 
&gt; 
&gt; //(Norvelio is seen going to a wall with several holes, he climbs it until he almost touches the ceiling. As he descends a silver crystal can be seen in his mouth, and once on the ground he begins to consume it over the course of three minutes.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** That&#39;s a little better, while I was eating I was thinking if you wouldn&#39;t mind letting me write down the details of those events instead of mentioning them to you. I&#39;d feel more at ease that way, and by the way, we&#39;d waste less time getting to our next destination. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** I&#39;m fine with that, but where do we go now? To the mushroom forest from last time? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** I&#39;m afraid our destination is not as peaceful as that. We are going towards the answers to your doubts, we will travel to [[[el-abismo-de-odosha|Odosha&#39;s Abyss]]].

One way of storing information is the use of books created from chitin, which has the property of printing thoughts in text by touch. The leaves are kept alive for an indefinite time and change their pigmentation to represent words. If the book were to die, the last inscriptions are permanently engraved on the leaves. Below is a leaf belonging to these books with the details mentioned in the previous record:

&gt; //At the time of my people&#39;s escape, when we could escape from the end of our times with the help of the Burial Worms, an unprecedented evil manifested. But, should I call an unknown force evil? Is it audacious of me to judge without contemplating the paradigms of my mind? Perhaps so, in any case, I find no natural justification for such a chaotic act without any sense. It is natural, because in a world where the most suitable manages to extend its arms to take over, everything has always been found under a flag, a goal or an idea.// 
&gt; 
&gt; //And what evil idea can explain that day? For not only did a great part of my people fall to such thoughts into the Abyss. Who waved the banner of extermination? For no nation of the ancient world took responsibility. Did they succeed in consummating their goal? Even in these days, I still wonder what really stopped them. The appearance of this exception was brief in its acts, the display of power summoned from the depths to bury and forget was absurd.//
&gt; 
&gt; //It does not matter if we are able to break through the hot center of our world, their lives descended and were consumed in the cruel heat that caused this event. To my misfortune, I was able to get the memories of a survivor, in order to preserve that distant past, and I saw it. The holes under our feet opened up like a beast, a roar was expelled from that cursed mouth followed by the appearance of more and more mouth-shaped holes.// 
&gt; 
&gt; //Momentarily the surface revisited its first days in creation, rivers from the center of our planet flowed across the plains where once flowers were waiting to grow. The sky was covered with corrupt smoke infecting the white clouds, losing its vivid blue to turn crimson, not even the Sun was able to illuminate such a disproportionate fall.// 
&gt; 
&gt; //Was it due to an unknown natural process? No way, because after several days of that infernal and sick flood, the melted blood of the planet returned through those same mouths, different flowers covered the wounds, and oblivion struck those who were able to witness and survive the event.// 
&gt; 
&gt; //Perhaps it was a fatal disease of our world, waiting for the moment to end it once and for all. That would have been a more comforting answer, because in the end I found the answer in another chapter of our history.  For our people decided to face the mouths of Odosha on their own ground before they could rise again. We cut out his tongue never again to consume the beauty of the surface.// 
&gt; 
&gt; //And I, who undertook my quest for knowledge, wish I could revive those who perished in the past in the countless ages of the world. Still, the future has never been more uncertain, for the mouths were not the final answer, but only a small demonstration of the true face of Odosha, the mysterious cyclic affliction of the Earth.//

Abyssal rodents share cultural elements with the Yekuana culture. Further research has shown that at some point in the past, one of these rodents was in contact with the Yekuana people, who considered them to be an emissary of the gods. The purpose of this rodent is unclear, but they were tasked with making known to the Yekuana two dual entities known as &#34;Wannadi&#34; and &#34;Odosha&#34;, the former depicted as a benevolent entity, represented as a woodpecker, and master of 8 different heavens; however, recent research indicates that these 8 heavens are actually 8 different states within Hoiohiña, and the true origin of Wannadi remains unknown. 

The second deity has no unique representation, being amorphous or described as &#34;a river of black tears&#34;. This entity is malevolent and actively seeks the destruction of Wannadi&#39;s creation. Information concerning the entity is even scarcer compared to Wannadi, being delicate and related to major events such as mass extinctions or reconfigurations of large portions of land. The veracity of such statements is still being verified, but has been somewhat supported by the following records:

&gt;  
&gt; **Foreword:** The excursion begins on the shores of a lake where the only flora is grass and small herbs, on the surface of the water it is possible to see several light blue luminescent spots, which are responsible for illuminating the place. 
&gt; -----
&gt; **(Begin Log)**
&gt; 
&gt; //(Norvelio holds a large, glowing red crystal, and throws it onto the shores of the lake with his tail. After a few seconds, a small boat emerges from the crystal.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** Sorry to keep you waiting for so long, setting up the boat took me longer than expected. Besides, I had to mentally prepare myself to sail on the Akuena, the most beautiful lake of all and the only shortcut to the dark past of the Abyss. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** It certainly is nice and magical, otherwise I can&#39;t find the reason for plants to exist in a place devoid of sunlight. Are we really going to get there by sailing to the place you mentioned? 
&gt;
&gt; **Norvelio:** There is no other way, unless you want to go all the way down through the different levels of our home, and let me tell you, not everyone is as open-minded as I am. And it would take us between 3 days and a week at best. Now... 
&gt; 
&gt; //(Norvelio points his tail towards the horizon of the lake.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** That course would take us into a stream to enter one of the main population centers. //(He wags his tail in the opposite position.)// And this one leads to the edge of the lake, where the lights go out and the soul rests, a zone of instability where all sorts of travels are possible. Ready to sail? 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** If that boat is all we need for the trip, and there are no other warnings, I&#39;m fine to proceed. Are you sure no additional protection is necessary? Our little boat looks too rudimentary for such an expedition. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** Sometimes the simplest method is the right one. Don&#39;t leave all the work of perception to your eyes either, I&#39;ve put a lot of care into that little boat. 
&gt; 
&gt; //(Norvelio and Estrada climb into the boat, which takes a more detailed appearance seconds later, such as the appearance of a sphere where the engine would normally be. Several unknown engravings appear on the sides, and for a momen, a white sphere can be seen surrounding the boat. During the first 15 minutes they sail without any change in the environment, Norvelio is heard whistling a tune during this period of time; when he stops whistling, the ceiling of the cave begins to turn blue.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** Is this lake taking us to the surface? Or why does the sky suddenly seems to be appearing? I thought we were going somewhere deeper into the Earth.
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** Oh and you are not wrong. Not just any sky is manifesting, we are in the fourth of our heavens: Iadiñakuna. Sometimes I come here to ask the Mahewa butterflies about their work, but I don&#39;t think they will be here today, they know about our mission.  
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** A few moments ago I think I saw some electric eels, or at least from a distance they seemed to be so. Are these animals endemic to the fourth heaven or is it just the grass on the shores? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** They are spiritual beings guarding the other three lower &#34;heavens&#34;. The Mahewa protect and guide the winds, as do the eels, known as Dinushi, but in their case it&#39;s the water. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** It&#39;s strange for me to think of heavens so far below the earth, are all these places accessible through different subterranean lakes? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** Unfortunately no, the methods to reach each of them are different,, and the closer you get to the eighth heaven, the less time you can stay there. Well, it seems that the time has come, do you see any stars or clouds in the sky? 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** None, in fact, I thought I saw some clouds a few moments ago. Now what should we do? We seem to be in the middle of nowhere, can&#39;t even see the lights from above. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** So all conditions have been fulfilled, let&#39;s go to our true destiny, let&#39;s realize the fall into the Abyss itself. 
&gt; 
&gt; //(Norvelio reaches for another ruby and black crystal that was on the floor of the boat. He grabs it first with his tail and then takes it in his hands, scratching it for 30 seconds. He approaches the gunwale of the boat and carefully drops the crystal. After another 30 seconds, a small whirlpool begins to manifest under the boat.)// 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** I guess this is going according to plan, //(nervous)// right? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** You could say so, but getting to that place is already not in anyone&#39;s plans. I wouldn&#39;t worry too much, unless you&#39;re suffering from nausea or something like that. //(Concerned)// That&#39;s not the case, is it? I wouldn&#39;t want someone to throw up while descending, it would ruin the experience. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:**  If all I have to worry about is nausea, then there is no problem. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** Just keep your hands inside the boat and everything should be fine. The sphere you saw at the start serves as a capsule, there will be no problems with the water and the other elements at the time of our immersion. Neither with conditions such as temperature or pressure. 
&gt; 
&gt; //(The whirlpool grows over the next 45 seconds until it is large enough to sink the boat. The sphere manifests again and shields them from the water like a bubble. For the remainder of the descent, the audio log detects no sound. Every 10 minutes the color of the water becomes darker, mouthless faces and bats are abruptly visible for time to time. After 40 minutes, the liquid surrounding the boat turns completely black. After 60 minutes, the boat is found to be surrounded by magma and in the 70th minute they emerge back into a magma lake.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** I didn&#39;t think... What is that? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** This is the prison of the last direct descendant of Odosha, and that is one of his tongues. 
&gt; 
&gt; //(At this point the camera starts to fail, but it is possible to see a structure similar to a snake&#39;s tongue, although its full size is not possible to be captured in the frame. Other similar but smaller structures seem to emerge from the tongue, resembling the conformation of a fractal. The camera suffers another failure and shows nothing for 7 seconds, once it returns to normal, 3 more similar structures are found, the tongues begin to move and at that moment, the video recording stops working. Later it would be determined that the video recording was corrupted, since at no time did Estrada or Norvelio make any reference to this fact.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** It&#39;s one of the odoshankomos at the service of Odosha. The area known as &#34;Odosha&#39;s Abyss&#34; is more of a border and we are in its beginning. You were looking for proof, weren&#39;t you? Here is one. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** Needless to say, if that&#39;s just his tongue I can&#39; t imagine his whole body. Was that the cause of that mass extinction? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** No, this being never managed to see the surface of the Earth thanks to the sacrifice of our people. The first time we met the odoshankomos we lost on the surface, and this extinction occurred. It was five thousand years ago when this tongue began to manifest in the mantle of the Earth. But this time we were prepared, or at least, we knew it was coming, and my ancestors used every stone, mineral, magic crystal, every spell known to our world, and the blood merged in this place. We beat it at a high price, but we have recovered. 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** And yet, you still have a big concern, don&#39;t you? Because as you told me, this is just one of his servants, and nothing is yet known about the real threat. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** It feels good to have found someone who understands me. Since we are here, do you want to know why I really insisted on having contact with humanity? 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:** It&#39;s a weird time to ask that, but go ahead. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** When I had just left my litter and learned about this vast world, I thought I could make our two species meet face to face. I was still young and somewhat innocent, after a while I realized that it would be impossible to do something like that. Their world knew monsters and darkness just like ours. But do you know what I aimed for? I did everything rodently possible to keep my people safe, to alert yours about a still misunderstood danger, and to make sure I didn&#39;t fight alone. Do you understand? 
&gt; 
&gt; **P. Estrada:**  I can understand that, it&#39;s true that my work has put me in front of some monstrosities, and I recognize your concern. We will try to contain whatever this thing is, one way or another. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Norvelio:** I hope I can trust you and your people as I have always done. Because in the end, life on Earth must not be defeated again.

&gt; **Assigned Department:** Department of Theology; member: Francisca Ochoa (F. Ochoa).
&gt;  
&gt; **Foreword:** Simultaneously with the encounter of P. Estrada with Norvelio, researcher F. Ochoa accompanied another member of //R. Abissos//. This was appointed at the request of the Attitiudi Hana of Iadekuna. Their representative is named Hainalda, a female specimen, with brown fur and a necklace of several prismatic crystals. She has the same ability as Norvelio to communicate. 
&gt; -----
&gt; **(Begin Log)**
&gt; 
&gt; //(Both of them travel through a system of caves from the first area (Jahuakudahana) to the second (Iadekuna)- the presence of luminous minerals increases as they advance. They stop once they reach another area full of fungi, however, it is not possible to see any kind of pattern on the ground.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Hainalda:** We finally arrived, human, to the second area of my land, Iadekuna. At a place where we will not be seen together. 
&gt; 
&gt; **F. Ochoa:** Why should we care about being seen? Other than the confidentiality of our meeting. 
&gt;   
&gt; **Hainalda:** First of all, no human has ever set foot on these lands, and secondly, those who know of you all are well aware of your catastrophic nature. If it weren&#39;t for the fact that perhaps there is no chance of survival without mutual support, I would not be talking to you. 
&gt; 
&gt; **F. Ochoa:** So what do you mean by &#34;catastrophic nature&#34;? One specific event? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hainalda:** Sometimes I&#39; m concerned that even among you, events of enormous magnitude are hidden. But to answer your question, didn&#39;t you carry out a genocide in the northern upper lands? Didn&#39;t you try to eliminate or coldly lock up everything that you don&#39;t understand?
&gt; 
&gt; **F. Ochoa:** Our mission is about research. I don&#39;t know about the first event you cite, but I know there must have been a reason for it. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hainalda:** So what ensures our safety around you? You can always find a justification to cover up your cruel acts. Although, it&#39;s also not my mission to deal with these issues, and certainly not with someone who only follows protocol. 
&gt; 
&gt; **F. Ochoa:** Following that protocol, what is that necklace for? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hainalda:** It&#39;s not part of our agreement to answer those types of questions. While my partner can provide you with that type of information, please refrain from asking such questions. 
&gt; 
&gt; //(Hainalda produces a few grave squeaks.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Hainalda:** Anyway, what were your concerns about our mythology? 
&gt; 
&gt; **F. Ochoa:** They were mostly about Wannadi, about his importance and role for your people. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hainalda:** On Wannadi it&#39;s enough for you to know about his role in the creation of all that exists, across the depths, the sky and the earth. But in our world he made sure to leave his subordinates, mostly to oversee the Abyss and its dangers.  
&gt; 
&gt; **F. Ochoa:** So Wannadi is a universal entity, while Odosha is-
&gt; 
&gt; **Hainalda:**  Don&#39;t say that name directly, at least not in front of me.  
&gt; 
&gt; **F. Ochoa:** Excuse me. As I was saying, would the Abyss only be an entity pertinent to Earth? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hainalda:**  No, both are in the same rank. The Abyss was sealed long ago, longer than you could imagine. Just for a moment imagine it, the chaos that the Abyss would be able to cause by being free in existence. 
&gt; 
&gt; **F. Ochoa:** Okay, I understand. Another doubt I have is about the Burial Worms. Unlike other entities mentioned by human groups, there is nothing about this one. Why is this? Are they representatives of the Abyss or Wannadi? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hainalda:**  They are a particular case, if I may say so. They were odoshankomos, beings at the service of the Abyss - their power is highly variable, and they can present themselves in different forms. But the essence of Earth, impregnated by the presence of Wannadi, was able to reverse their malevolent nature. 
&gt; 
&gt; **F. Ochoa:** One could say that Wannadi has this ability to override evil, isn&#39;t that right? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hainalda:**  OIf only it were that simple. He is able to remove the contamination of the Abyss, which infects the original akató.[[footnote]]Translation pending, can be exchanged for spirit or soul.[[/footnote]]. And in that case it was only the essence he left behind. Wannadi himself has not appeared in our world in the present times, because we accepted his task. 
&gt; 
&gt; **F. Ochoa:** Do your people somehow seek to bring this entity back? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hainalda:** That must be one of your important questions, because it would affect your //world//. But luckily, we don&#39;t seek that goal. We were given a second chance to live. ,More than that, to protect this world. That is why we are here, to try to improve communication with your species... And since I have told you so much, could you tell me something about your world?
&gt; 
&gt; **F. Ochoa:** Sure, I have an audio transmitter here, so Command can confirm if I&#39;m able to answer you. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hainalda:** Do those empires centered on the manipulation of flesh, and their war against the followers of gears and metal, still exist? Has that eccentric city of black stars disappeared once and for all? Nothing&#39;s to them, but I would rather stop living with rumors and know some of the truth. 
&gt; 
&gt; //(F. Ochoa sends the questions to Comand. After 10 minutes, she receives the approved answers.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **F. Ochoa:** Although there are still some groups from those empires, they are no longer known as such. Their presence has been relegated to myths for most people. About that city, from time to time it manages to manifest itself, although not in a very serious way. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hainalda:** Good to know about the fall and end of that war between those two groups. Although, as long as that city keeps popping up from time to time, it&#39;s a big problem... Any other questions to conclude?
&gt; 
&gt; **F. Ochoa:** Will the Abyss awaken soon, at least in this century? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hainalda:** May Wannadi protect us if so, but as far as we know, —I must stress that we don&#39;t know everything—, it will not awaken for another millennium. However, the odoshankomos are a different story, appearing almost spontaneously or regaining their strength; although their destructive capacity and dangerousness are not as great as the Abyss, they could put an end to us all if we do not stop them.
