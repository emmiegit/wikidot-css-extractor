**Item #:** SCP-273-J

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** All cans of SCP-273-J are to be seized from commercial retail locations, and every new shipment of SCP-273-J is to be automatically redirected to the Foundation[[footnote]]Under the pseudonym of the &#34;Food and Beverage Safety Inspection Agency&#34;. [[/footnote]] and stored in Locker-811, located in Sub-Level 73C in Site-198. 

D-Class personnel, janitors, and dehydrated individuals are not allowed to enter Locker-811 under any circumstances. All personnel are additionally advised that they are not to drink SCP-273-J under any circumstances, including the circumstances in which they are dehydrated, thirsty, or have spent more than 2-3 days in a desert environment without replenishing their personal drink supplies.

**Description:** SCP-273-J refers to a series of canned fruit juices sold under the name &#39;Freezies&#39;. A can of SCP-273-J is marked with the brand name &#39;Freezies&#39;, accompanied by the sentence, &#39;It&#39;s Freezingly Good!&#39;, on the side of the can. SCP-273-J is sold in several different flavours[[footnote]] Different flavours do not seem related to different effects on humans.[[/footnote]] : Apple, Orange, Pear, Peach, and Mango. No manufacturer&#39;s logo or name can be seen on the can itself.

Once a can of SCP-273-J is consumed by a human, SCP-273-J will drastically lower the temperature of the individual&#39;s body parts and organs to one below -1 degrees Celsius in a span of about an hour, slowing all body parts and organs to an almost-complete standstill and achieving an effect similar to the effects of cryogenic freezing. However, the human still exhibits signs of life, which include a slow, rhythmic beating of the heart, slight movements in the facial region, and attempts to communicate while speaking around a frozen tongue.

On May 15, 20██, at approximately 1545 hours, D-6745 (designated SCP-273-J-1) was in the process of transporting a carton of SCP-273-J to Locker-811 when he reportedly &#39;felt thirsty&#39;. After he noted that there were no other available ways for him to quench his thirst, D-6745 consumed a can of peach-flavoured SCP-273-J. By 1615 hours, D-6745 had experienced the full effects of SCP-273-J, and had become frozen in place in Sub-Level 20B in Site-198.

Researchers assigned to SCP-273-J attempted to interview D-6745 a few hours after he was frozen, only to obtain information described by the researchers as &#39;pure nonsense&#39;. Following the conclusion of the interview, D-6745 proceeded to be subjected to experimentation attempting to reverse the effects of SCP-273-J. (See Addendum 273-A)

&gt; **Interview Log 1:**
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Doctor Reese Martens, head researcher of SCP-273-J

&gt; 
&gt; //RM:// Why did you drink a can of SCP-273-J, even though you knew its effects?
&gt; 
&gt; //CB:// ycduyfctehuhh (Translated: I was thirsty.)
&gt; 
&gt; //RM:// We&#39;re going to have to find a way to reverse the effects of SCP-273-J on you. Do you mind if we do a couple of tests on you?
&gt;
