**Special Containment Procedures:** Internet activity world wide is to be monitored for signs of SCP-6839 manifestations. All evidence of SCP-6839 activity is to be deleted or confiscated, while witnesses are to be amnesticized.

All instances of SCP-6839 activity in testing are to be saved in digital form immediately.

The study of SCP-6839 has been delegated to the Department of Pataphysics.

**Description:** SCP-6839 is the designation given to a metaphysical entity manifesting in narratives below baseline reality. SCP-6839 manifests in and manipulates written stories[[footnote]] Instances of text in digital form have so far been unaffected. Evidence pointing towards SCP-6839&#39;s ability to affect narratives in digital form remains inconclusive. [[/footnote]] to insert itself as a heroic character of undefined appearance.[[footnote]] The only consistent character traits suggest it is a young male.   [[/footnote]] This effect is temporary, and affects only one instance of text at a time.

SCP-6839&#39;s behavior in any affected piece of narrative generally follows the same pattern. The manifestation begins as the appearance of SCP-6839 during a scene in which the villain of the story is present. SCP-6839 proceeds to defeat the villain, accomplishing this with relative ease. Once SCP-6839 departs the scene, the story proceeds normally with no further anomalous activity.

SCP-6839 seems to be unaware of what is considered &#34;normal&#34; or appropriate in the narratives it affects, resulting in its course of action being extremely unusual when compared to those of other characters depicted in the narrative.

The White Witch along with Edmund are present within a large room in the icy castle. The White Witch is attempting to persuade Edmund by offering him the candy which he requested, but is interrupted by her slipping in a pool of water. She becomes infuriated, and looks up to investigate the source of the water. She spots a large chandelier made of ice falling towards her, which she narrowly avoids.
Edmund spots SCP-6839 hanging from the roof by a rope. SCP-6839 descends while swearing loudly, seemingly having intended on dropping the chandelier only after delivering a &#34;cool&#34; catchphrase. The White Witch accuses Edmund of having attempted to distract her, and freezes him solid. SCP-6839 descends from the ceiling, striking The White Witch down before she has time to react. SCP-6839 attempts to light a fire in order to melt the ice encasing Edmund, but is not successful. SCP-6839 punches a wall repeatedly before leaving the scene.
The premature death of The White Witch had no effect on the story, as SCP-6839&#39;s appearance had no effect on the scenes prior or after to this one.

Ryūji Takayama encounters the ghost of Sadako Yamamura via the supernatural recording of her crawling out of the well and making her way out of the television towards him.
SCP-6839 emerges from the well some time after Sadako, and uses a lasso to pull her back into the well. Ryūji hears a struggle, followed by SCP-6839 jumping out of the well. SCP-6839 pulls a makeshift pipe bomb from behind the well, and drops it down. It then begins to run &#34;towards&#34; the television screen and jumps out of the television as the bomb detonates. The shockwave sends Ryūji against a wall, rendering him unconscious. SCP-6839 then tells Ryūji &#34;Cool guys don&#39;t look at explosions&#34;, however Ryūji is unresponsive.
SCP-6839 becomes distressed, and attempts to wake up Ryūji to no avail. SCP-6839 then hurriedly looks around it as to seek something to help Ryūji with, but ends up fleeing the scene via a window.

Harry Potter and Voldemort are facing each other in Hogwarts courtyard, preparing to engage against each other with magic. SCP-6839 manifests on top of a large pillar wearing a luchador wrestler outfit. It then warns Harry of Voldemort&#39;s intentions while jumping down at the latter, striking him in the head with a folding chair. Voldemort is killed by the blow, and his body begins to disintegrate.
The strike is then revealed to have disrupted the path of the bolt of magic launched by Voldemort, having resulted it in hitting Neville Longbottom instead of Harry. Neville lies dead at the entrance of Hogwarts. Several characters rush to his corpse, and Harry turns to SCP-6839 with a mix of shock and anger on his face. SCP-6839 stutters attempting to say something, but turns away and jumps off the nearby bridge.

The hunters attempt to speak to SCP-6839 but it interrupts them by shouting angrily and unintelligibly. SCP-6839 then retreats back into the bushes, but returns to view driving a large truck towards the hunters, who attempt to flee.
SCP-6839 gives chase but eventually crashes into a beaver dam, destroying a large part of it. The truck begins to sink into the river, and gasoline leaks into the water. SCP-6839 panics and attempts to remove the gasoline with its hands. It then realizes the futility of its attempt, sits on the river bank and covers its face with both of its hands.

**Addendum 6839-2: Experiment 6839.1**

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Date:** 9/8/2020

**Attending researchers:** Researcher Stone, Assistant Yun

**Foreword:** A simple story was written which depicted SCP-6839 as the villain, while the writers, Researcher Stone and Assistant Yun were depicted as the hero-protagonists.

The original narrative describes Assistant Yun attempting save a civilian from a burning building. The rescue is successful, but as Yun is returning into the building, the floor collapses. Researcher Stone grabs onto Yun, pulling her to safety. The remaining civilians are rescued, and SCP-6839, who started the fire is located and defeated after a hand-to-hand battle.  

The affected scene is summarized below.

------

Assistant Yun barges into a room in the third floor of the burning building, discovering a young boy cowering under the bed. Yun urges the child to be brave and grab onto her. The child complies, and both leave the room, running into Researcher Stone who emerges from a room located in the same hallway, carrying an unconscious man. The child begins to cry.

Yun and Stone proceed towards the exit. Pleads of help are heard from an apartment that has fallen debris blocking the door. Stone asks Yun if she can lead them both to safety so he can attempt to save the trapped person. Stone hands over the man to Yun, who then asks the child grab onto her jacket. Yun manages to bring them out of the building. The child sits on the ground, his crying increasing in volume.

The area in front of the building has several firetrucks and ambulances, though the only people present on the scene are those already rescued from the building. Yun is shocked and confused by this, but realizes she has no time to question it, turning back to run towards the building. Stone arrives at the entrance carrying an old woman, whom he brings to safety. Stone and Yun proceed back inside the building.

Suddenly a large amount of flaming debris falls from the ceiling. Stone pushes Yun out of the building, saving her before being crushed under the debris himself. Yun screams and crawls towards him, throwing pieces of cement and wood aside. Stone is still alive, albeit barely. He has suffered several third-degree burns. Yun is crying while using all of her strength to lift a beam that has crushed Stone&#39;s legs.

Yun manages to pull Stone to safety, repeatedly begging him to be alright. Stone grabs Yun&#39;s hand, struggling to speak between fits of cough. He winces in pain and takes a deep, raspy breath before managing to say &#34;I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re alright&#34;.
Yun hyperventilates, holding his head while repeatedly apologizing. Stone closes his eyes and passes away.

&#34;If I was stronger... If I just reacted faster. You&#39;d still be... alive and saving others. Why for me?&#34; Yun says through her tears.

Her attention is then diverted to a whimper sounding from behind her. Her crying dies down slightly as she turns her head towards the sound. She spots SCP-6839 standing behind her. The young boy is sitting on the ground beside it, his back towards her. Yun realizes SCP-6839 and the boy look exactly alike, although of different age.

&#34;This is how it feels. No amount of days saved will bring him back.&#34; SCP-6839 says.

The boy then turns his head to look at Yun, the tears flowing from his eyes seemingly having left severe corrosion damage to his face. They lock eyes while the boy asks her:

&#34;Do you still want to be a hero?&#34;

------

**Afterword:** Following the hours following the experiment, Researcher Stone reported Assistant Yun acting abnormally absent-minded and silent. A short checkup was conducted, ending with Assistant Yun insisting that she was alright. No further measures were taken.

[[/div]]

**Addendum 6839-3: Experiment 6839.2**

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Date:** 14/8/2020

**Attending researchers:** [ID MISSING]

**Foreword:** The following is an unauthorized experiment conducted by Assistant Yun with the aim to contact SCP-6839 as directly as possible.

Assistant Yun wrote a short story depicting her and SCP-6839 sitting beside a table in the middle of an endless field of flowers. The story involves only dialogue between Yun and SCP-6839. The conversation is seemingly irrelevant to anything related to The Foundation or SCP-6839&#39;s occupation as a hero. The story ends abruptly with the last line, belonging to SCP-6839, having been left empty.

The affected scene is described below.

------

//Assistant Yun and SCP-6839 sit in silence. A gentle breeze blows across the field of flowers. SCP-6839 glances around it, while Yun calmly sips her tea.//

**SCP-6839:** This is a waste of time.

**Yun:** I was hoping we could take a moment to talk. Even heroes need to take some time to relax.

**SCP-6839:** I&#39;ll relax after these villains are behind bars, or better yet, dead!

//SCP-6839 stands up and starts walking away from the table, eventually disappearing from Yun&#39;s sight. After an undetermined amount of time it returns, approaching the table from a different direction.//

**SCP-6839:** There&#39;s no end to this field.

**Yun:** I know. I&#39;m the one who wrote this story after all.

**SCP-6839:** You know I wouldn&#39;t even be here if there was no villain to defeat. If you wrote this narrative, then you know where the scum is. Please tell me, there&#39;s no time to waste.

//Yun urges SCP-6839 to sit down again. SCP-6839 seems displeased, but complies.//

**Yun:** Tell me a bit of your career as a hero. I&#39;ve watched you for some time now, and I&#39;m sure you have even more awesome stories to tell.

//SCP-6839 perks up and sits up straight.//

**SCP-6839:** A fan huh? Well I suppose I have some time to spare. A proper hero has to stretch everywhere after all. Lets see, I&#39;m simply someone who is guided by the light of justice just as much as I am someone who enforces it. I&#39;m sure you are waiting to hear some comic book origin story, but I&#39;m really just a guy who does what is needed.

**Yun:** Wow. I&#39;m sure you have a lot of fans out there.

**SCP-6839:** [//Chuckles//] Naturally miss. Once you go bang on a villain here and bang on a villain there, people tend to be quite appreciative. All in a day&#39;s work for someone like me. Oh, almost forgot. You must want an autograph.

**Yun:** I—

**SCP-6839:** No worries, I always keep a pen and paper with me.

//SCP-6839 writes its autograph on a piece of paper and hands it to Yun. Yun is unable to read it due to how hastily it was written. SCP-6839 grins.//  

**Yun:** Thank you... where was I? Right, do you have anyone you look up to? Maybe even someone who motivated you to become a hero?

//SCP-6839 becomes visibly anxious. It breathes heavily, and trembles slightly.//

**SCP-6839:** No. No there&#39;s not. I&#39;m the one who people look up to.

**Yun:** Makes sense. It&#39;s hard to imagine someone as great as you.

**SCP-6839:** I can...

**Yun:** Excuse me?

**SCP-6839:** Nothing, I was just uh, clearing my throat. As I was saying, [//SCP-6839&#39;s voice is slightly trembling//] no villain so far has been a match for me. Might sounds pompous, but it&#39;s just facts. Not exactly the challenge a grand hero could want, but I&#39;m just glad to help.

**Yun:** Who exactly are you helping?

**SCP-6839:** Huh?

**Yun:** I told you I had been watching you, and from what I&#39;ve seen, things don&#39;t generally seem to end that well for the people you are supposed to save. Forgive me if I sound rude, but I think it&#39;s just strange for a hero to prioritize its ego instead of the people who are in need of saving.

**SCP-6839:** But... if I beat the villain, it can&#39;t hurt anyone else.  

**Yun:** Have you even considered what happens after all that? Killing a slave trader isn&#39;t going to end slavery. Someone else will take their place. What then? Are you just going to repeat it all? All more people going to die because you want to seem cool? Are villains some means of bolstering your reputation to you? Why are you a hero?

//SCP-6839 is astonished by this. It is unable to provide an answer.//  

**Yun:** I&#39;m sorry to be so harsh, I really am. I just want you to be honest with me. And most importantly yourself.

//SCP-6839 tips the table over in a fit of rage. Yun recoils slightly in fear, but manages to remain calm. SCP-6839 is visibly trembling and sweating. It stares at the ground beneath it for a moment before giving Yun an apologetic look. It then sits down again.//

**SCP-6839:** Where is the villain?

**Yun:** You already know. But this is a battle you can&#39;t win with superpowers.

//SCP-6839 becomes irritated again, but regains its composure quickly. It nods and takes a deep breath.//  

**SCP-6839:** There once was someone I called a hero. He was the best of the best. //[SCP-6839 pauses for a moment and wipes its eyes on its sleeve.]// I wouldn&#39;t even be here if it wasn&#39;t for him.

**Yun:** Why do you blame yourself for what happened to him?

**SCP-6839:** How the hell did you know?

**Yun:** You weren&#39;t that discreet working with the last story I wrote.

//Both sit in silence for a short moment.//

**Yun:** Listen to me. I&#39;m sure your hero wouldn&#39;t regret what happened. A hero puts others before themselves, that&#39;s the point. Once a villain is defeated, another will eventually takes its place. But the difference a hero makes every time they save a person is something that will always be there.    

**SCP-6839:** But... if I acted faster... if I wouldn&#39;t be this worthless coward, he would still be saving people.

**Yun:** I&#39;m sure you think there was a lot you think you should have or shouldn&#39;t have done. But I&#39;m sure you did your best. That&#39;s all that can be expected of you.

**SCP-6839:** My best will never compare to him. Every day has to count or... it was all for nothing.

**Yun:** There&#39;s been enough of this egoistic heroism, don&#39;t you think? Did he ever put his ego before the people he was saving? No wonder you&#39;re nothing like him when you&#39;re on the entirely wrong path.

//SCP-6839 clenches its head with both of its hands, and lets out a loud groan.//

**Yun:** All this self blaming just steers you away from what you want to be. It wasn&#39;t your fault, and you have nothing to prove.   

**SCP-6839:** I want to think you&#39;re right but I can&#39;t shake this guilt. Shit, I&#39;ve been such a disappointment. Fuck, it wasn&#39;t supposed to be like this.

**Yun:** It&#39;s not too late to change. And I know it&#39;s hard. Things won&#39;t change overnight no matter what. One step at a time, one day at a time.

**SCP-6839:** I don&#39;t get how you managed to conjure up a story like this. This doesn&#39;t make any sense.

**Yun:** I didn&#39;t write this, you did. This is all you. The hero, the villain and the civilian to be saved. Hell, you might as well be all these flowers.

**SCP-6839:** I&#39;m so confused. What is this supposed to mean? I&#39;m not in the mood for games.

//The table appears upright between Yun and SCP-6839. Yun leans forward towards SCP-6839.//

**Yun:** You agree with all this, whether you choose to acknowledge it or not.  

//Yun then leans back again. A path leading towards the horizon clears behind SCP-6839.//

**Yun:** What happens next is up to you. Just you.

//SCP-6839 thinks silently to itself, and gives Yun a slight nod. It then stands up and begins to walk along the path. Upon glancing back, SCP-6839 spots the young boy sitting where Yun sat seconds ago. The boys face is once again covered in tears and corrosion damage. SCP-6839 flinches.//

**Young boy:** Do you still want to be a hero?  

//SCP-6839 approaches the boy until it is standing right in front of him. SCP-6839 breathes heavily, silently looking at the weeping child.//

**SCP-6839:** Yeah. I&#39;ll do my best.

//SCP-6839 turns to walk along the path once more. The young boy stops weeping before it, the table and the chairs disappear. The narrativic viewpoint loses SCP-6839 entirely. The remainder of the story consists entirely of descriptions of the flowers in a positive manner.//

------

**Afterword:** No cases of SCP-6839 activity have been observed since this experiment. Foundation personnel[[footnote]] With the exception of Assistant Yun [[/footnote]] and assets are to resume their normal duties related to SCP-6839 for the time being.

**Addendum 6839-4: Update 17/12/2020**

SCP-6839 ceased activity for approximately 2 months before resuming activity, which instigated a surveillance period spanning from 5/10/2020 to 16/12/2020.
SCP-6839&#39;s habits of manifestation have remained unchanged, however the behavior it displays has altered significantly. The first confirmed case of SCP-6839 manifestation during the surveillance period is summarized below.

SCP-6839 manifests at the bank of a river, wearing clothing that hides its identity. It walks upstream along the river until it spots two humanoids in a boat. SCP-6839 stares at the water near the boat before making its way closer to them.
The two humanoids, Sméagol and Déagol are fishing. SCP-6839 asks them to come ashore, telling them it is a traveler visiting their settlement. Sméagol and Déagol join SCP-6839, who then offers to buy them drinks at the tavern. The two make their way towards the village after SCP-6839 told them it would meet them at their destination.
SCP-6839 then digs a hole at the base of a large tree, retrieves a ring from the river and drops it in the hole. It fills up the hole, and leaves the scene.
