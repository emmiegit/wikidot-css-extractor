    caption=Three SCP-3169-1 instances.
]]

**Item #:** SCP-3169

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3169 is to be kept in a small refrigerated unit. Use of SCP-3169-1 instances for research purposes is restricted to personnel of Level-2 security clearance or higher.

**Description:** SCP-3169 designates six sealed foil bags, marked with the words &#39;Unsalted Pistachios&#39;. Each bag contains 24 unshelled and roasted pistachio nuts, henceforth designated SCP-3169-1. SCP-3169 instances do not list ingredients or nutritional information. 

Upon SCP-3169 being opened, SCP-3169-1 instances will metamorphose into live //Oncorhynchus mykiss//[[footnote]]Rainbow trout.[[/footnote]] and //Cyprinus carpio// [[footnote]]Common carp.[[/footnote]] specimens over the space of two to four seconds, causing the bag to violently rupture. 

Metamorphosed SCP-3169-1 instances are non-anomalous, barring the fins, which are typically four times larger than those of an average member of their species.

**Addendum 3169.01:** Recovery

SCP-3169 was discovered in &#39;OneSpot&#39;, a small, family-run convenience store located in ███, UK, after online recordings indicated that an extranormal event had occurred.  After receiving heavy circulation through various social media websites, Foundation disinformation campaigns were initiated with the intent to pass the footage off as a hoax.

In total, six SCP-3169 instances were recovered from the scene. All eyewitnesses were administered Class-C amnestics.

**Addendum 3169.02:** GoI Connections

Foundation web-crawlers supervising all major social communication platforms for GoI-related activity discovered chat logs indicating the source of the incident to be 17 year-old Lewis Reeves.

Reeves is an active member of GoI &#39;[http://www.scp-wiki.net/gamers-against-weed-hub Gamers Against Weed]&#39;, and has engaged in numerous conversations under the online alias &#39;smoka-cola&#39;.

&gt; **smoka-cola:** yeah
&gt; **smoka-cola:** sorry this feels really weird to type but thanks for sticking up for me
&gt; **smoka-cola:** i guess i&#39;m not used to getting so much confrontation irl
&gt; **MintyDay:** Why&#39;s that?
&gt; **smoka-cola:** because it&#39;s ten times easier to run
&gt; **smoka-cola:** rather than trying to hold a cogent argument with the fucking kingpin of the chat room you know i just dont want to fight that fight
&gt; **MintyDay:** Omfg is that what you really think of crooke?
&gt; **MintyDay:** &#34;&#34;&#34;Kingpin&#34;&#34;&#34; emphasis on the pin holy shit.
&gt; **MintyDay:** Crooke is a classic troll he just feeds off people&#39;s reactions.
&gt; **MintyDay:** He&#39;s a cunt
&gt; **MintyDay:** But we love him
&gt; **MintyDay:** Because we know how to defuse him and get away from the gross fleshy fucking gargoyle exterior yeah?
&gt; **MintyDay:** If you just mellow out and let him burn out
&gt; **MintyDay:** I promise you things will get better
&gt; **MintyDay:** YOu still there dude?
&gt; **smoka-cola:** yeah
&gt; **smoka-cola:** thank you
&gt; **smoka-cola:** idk that means a lot more than you probably realise

&gt; **smoka-cola:** i mean like i was thinking maybe i could put more 
&gt; **smoka-cola:** nuts in the bag
&gt; **smoka-cola:** thus creating more fish
&gt; **MintyDay:** You have no idea do you.
&gt; **MintyDay:** This is just a vague grab from the back of your intimidated mind.
&gt; **smoka-cola:** you put it so bleakly 
&gt; **smoka-cola:** but yeah essentially.
&gt; **MintyDay:** I&#39;m the last person you need to impress smoka. I get your thing and I want to help you with it, so like, no judgement here.
&gt; **smoka-cola:** right sorry
&gt; **MintyDay:** That said: drop the fish nut thing. It&#39;s not going to work. I would bend over backwards and bow at your fucking feet if you could pull of a fish stunt and make one of the other guys laugh.
&gt; **smoka-cola:** it was more a finna nut thing.
&gt; **smoka-cola:** but ok thank you 
&gt; **MintyDay:** Yw dude

&gt; **smoka-cola:** you know what
&gt; **smoka-cola:** that wasn&#39;t actually very funny
&gt; **smoka-cola:** and you&#39;re quite a pathetic person.

&gt; **hjcrooke:** omfg you don&#39;t get it do you
&gt; **hjcrooke:** this isn&#39;t a fight
&gt; **hjcrooke:** we were never fighting
&gt; **hjcrooke:** i was making jokes
&gt; **hjcrooke:** i thought i could break you into it
&gt; **hjcrooke:** shit i thought minty would at least have given you a private heads up
&gt; **hjcrooke:** but instead you run away or make a fucking song and dance about it
&gt; **bones:** Crooke.
&gt; **hjcrooke:** let me finish
&gt; **hjcrooke:** this isn&#39;t a fucking hierarchy
&gt; **hjcrooke:** you don&#39;t survive by pulling  some other self-inflated prick down 
&gt; **hjcrooke:** you have a skin made of fucking stone and you never drop it
&gt; **hjcrooke:** we rinse each other and call each other cunts and make jokes about fucking each other&#39;s mum
&gt; **hjcrooke:** because compliments are depressing
&gt; **hjcrooke:** compliments are what you give people you feel sorry for
&gt; **hjcrooke:** that&#39;s my philosophy
&gt; **hjcrooke:** and if yours is to bitch and moan until someone fills that vast gaping need for validation  you&#39;ve got bottled up inside of you
&gt; **hjcrooke:** then i don&#39;t want to be a part of this.
&gt; **~ hjcrooke was banned. (no reason given)**
&gt; **bones:** I think he made himself perfectly clear.
&gt; **MintyDay:** He just needs a break bones.
&gt; **MintyDay:** Some time to think.

[[# A1]]**Addendum 3169.03:** Incident 3169/01

The corpse of Lewis Reeves was discovered on 8/24/2017 after police reports suggested the presence of anomalous activity. The epidermis of Reeves&#39; chest and lower back had been hardened, with tissue sampling suggesting equivalent strength to that of concrete.

Autopsy revealed the cause of death to be large deposits of sand and various other minerals forming within Reeve&#39;s vital organs. A search warrant on Reeves&#39; home has been submitted in hopes of potentially recovering  and containing anomalous objects.

&gt; **bones:** My answer is no.
&gt; **MintyDay:** Please bones. A yearlong at least.
&gt; **bones:** You&#39;ve already agreed to the monthlong. I&#39;m not extending the ban any further.
&gt; **MintyDay:** I agreed on the monthlong before he fucking killed one of us.
&gt; **MintyDay:** He&#39;s volatile. He doesn&#39;t belong here.
&gt; **bones:** Compose yourself. Crooke is many things, but he&#39;s not a murderer, and he&#39;s not volatile. We know exactly what he&#39;s about and we know exactly why he&#39;s about it.
&gt; **bones:** Cola was volatile. He let his emotions get the best of him and that doesn&#39;t mesh well with reality bending. He overreacted. He pushed his own limits.
&gt; **bones:** Accidents happen.
&gt; **MintyDay:** So what? Even then, he kills himself and doesn&#39;t deserve our pity?
&gt; **bones:** Of course he deserves our pity. But he doesn&#39;t deserve petty revenge. Especially not petty revenge that he didn&#39;t ask for.
&gt; **bones:** Ban is firm.
&gt; **MintyDay:** What do we do now?
&gt; **bones:** Move on.
&gt; **bones:** As per usual.
