**Foreword:** Due to the island&#39;s near-total isolation for over seven hundred years, the mythological tradition of [[[SCP-6078 | Hy-Brasil]]] appears both alien and familiar to outside observers. Foundation mythologists have noted numerous similarities between Brasilic folklore and the wider Celtic canon, with such recurring themes as love, death, vengeance and betrayal. The following is a brief compilation of early Brasilic legends, many of which are known or believed to predate the more established Dyrmudic Cycle[[footnote]]Term applied to the body of legends documenting the life and death of the semimythical figure Dyrmud the Ageless, who is supposedly responsible for the island&#39;s dimensionally transcendental status.[[/footnote]].

While literature from this era remains scarce, many of these tales have survived due to the island&#39;s rich tradition of oral storytelling, and have been translated and summarized by the Foundation [[[SCP-6087 | Department of Mythology and Folkloristics]]].

The Laughing Stone, which sits atop the hill of //Sliobmoir// and overlooks the river //Deoira//, has been integral to Brasilic coronation ceremonies since at least the fifth century CE. In antiquity, the rock is said to have erupted with joyous laughter when the island&#39;s true king set his foot upon it, and remained silent in the presence of pretenders. The Laughing Stone&#39;s origins are disputed, with most accounts stating that the object was gifted from the gods during the War of Five Crowns[[footnote]]Prolonged conflict, which took place during an indeterminate period between the second and fifth centuries CE, during a period where the island had no clear ruler.[[/footnote]], in the hopes of ushering a new age of peace.

The most widely-known story concerning the Laughing Stone dates to the late eighth century CE. During this era, Brasil was ruled by the high king Fionbir the Grizzled, whose only son, Cormaic (also known by the epithet //Feasógtin//[[footnote]]&#39;Fire-beard&#39;, a name derived from Cormaic&#39;s thick, ginger facial hair.[[/footnote]]) had died in battle. In honor of his late heir, Fionbir vowed to never shave again, and some twelve years later, he himself died after tripping over his own long, silver beard. The Grizzled King&#39;s expected successor was his nephew, Ronain. However, four nights before the coronation could take place, matters were complicated by the arrival of Nyall and Eimen, two brothers who had journeyed far on horseback from the eastern regions.

Nyall, the older of the two brothers, was a poor man who dreamt of being king, longing for the power and prestige that came with the title. After learning of Fionbir&#39;s passing, Nyall seized his opportunity, and disguised himself as the late prince Cormaic. So determined was he to seize the throne, that to add veracity to his claim, Nyall cut off one hand and plucked out one eye, creating the illusion that he had been wounded in fierce battle. The imposter claimed that during combat, he hit his head upon a rock, causing him to lose all memory of his previous life. He reported that his brother Eimen (who he claimed was a local farmer) had taken him in, and served as his sole provider for the intervening twelve years. Nyall claimed to have regained his memories following a dream in which he was visited by the goddess //Ecna//[[footnote]]Brasilic deity associated with the concept of knowledge, memories, and poetic inspiration.[[/footnote]], who informed him of his father&#39;s passing.

Despite some initial skepticism, many of the island&#39;s nobles, including Cormaic&#39;s own mother and sister, grew to accept Nyall as the Grizzled King&#39;s lost son. Any lingering doubts were extinguished on the day of the imposter&#39;s coronation when, as Nyall set foot upon the blessed stone, it appeared to laugh uproariously. Unbeknownst to the islanders however, this was merely the final stage of Nyall&#39;s plot: the stone had in fact remained silent, the laughter having been produced by Eimen, who was hiding from behind a nearby tree.

The only person to witness this deception was Urla, the daughter of Maed, a palace cook. The wily maiden had grown enamored of the fabled stone, and longed to hear its laugh, although knew that only men of noble birth were permitted in its presence. As such, she, like Eimen, was hidden from view when she witnessed the latter&#39;s treachery. After returning to the palace, Urla was initially too afraid to confess what she had seen, but later confided in Maed, who assured her daughter that she knew precisely what to do.

That same evening, the men sat down to drink and feast in celebration of their new king. Maed, having taken the feather from an unplucked goose, crept behind the drunken Eimen (who was now a knight, as reward for his supposed hospitality towards the king). With her feather, Maed tickled Eimen on the back of the neck, causing him to laugh loudly and heartily. Recognizing this laugh as being identical to that supposedly produced by the stone some hours earlier, the noblemen knew that they had been tricked. Prince Ronain was immediately coronated, and as reward for her bravery, Urla was invited to the ceremony atop //Sliobmoir//. Here, she heard the stone&#39;s true laugh, which was every bit as wondrous and enchanting as in the stories she had heard as a child. It was here that King Ronain proposed to her, and she became one of Brasil&#39;s most beloved queens.

The rightful king showed no mercy to Nyall and his brother. As punishment for their treason, Ronain demanded that both men be crushed to death by the same stone whose name they had sullied, and it was done. While the islanders celebrated, the Laughing Stone was displeased, for it had been presented to mortals in the name of peace, and was not intended to be used as a method of execution. For three days and three nights, the rock wept and wailed, with all attempts to raise its sunken spirits through music and dancing proving fruitless. The mournful stone continued to weep until each drop of Nyall and Eimen&#39;s blood had been cleansed from its surface, its tears forming the river //Deoira//. While the Laughing Stone remains in usage in modern Brasilic coronations, it has not been heard to laugh since.

The //Selkies// or //Seal Folk// are a mystical race of aquatic shapeshifters, which feature prominently in a number of Brasilic fables and folktales. As in similar cultures[[footnote]]Most notably, that of north Scotland and the Outer Hebrides.[[/footnote]], these creatures are described as being capable of changing from seal to human form (usually that of an attractive young woman) by removing their leathery skins. The most common motif of such stories involves mortal men who seek to marry a selkie, typically by stealing their sealskin[[footnote]]Categorized by the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aarne%E2%80%93Thompson%E2%80%93Uther_Index Aarne–Thompson–Uther Index] as ATU 402 (&#34;The Animal Bride&#34;).[[/footnote]], thus trapping them in their human form.

In western Coillarnach, one story tells of a handsome, hard-working young farmer named Domnal. One morning, Domnal sighted one of the spellbinding seal-maidens washing her long, flowing hair in the waters of a nearby river. The selkie was charmed by the young man&#39;s presence, and beckoned him over, although the love-struck Domnal was at first far too shy to approach her. He instead returned home, where he reluctantly told his brother, the boorish and slovenly Bryndub, of what he had seen. Despite some skepticism, Bryndub decided to humor Domnal, and insisted that he accompany him back to the river, so he could see this supposed enchantress for himself.

After laying eyes on the majestic creature that sat before him, Bryndub, like Domnal, was immediately smitten, his brother&#39;s words having failed to capture the true extent of her magnificence. Thinking fast, Bryndub seized the selkie&#39;s magical skin, and demanded that she become his bride. Much to Domnal&#39;s disappointment, the seal maiden appeared to accept his conniving brother&#39;s proposal. However, she noted that the air had grown colder, and claimed that she could not possibly marry Bryndub if he fell ill on their wedding day. She suggested that Bryndub wear her sealskin to keep himself warm, to which he thoughtlessly agreed. As soon as he did so however, the leathery coat began to expand, enveloping his entire body, and changing him into a seal. No longer interested in his selkie bride, the newly transformed Bryndub instead succumbed to his lust for the sea, and swam towards the ocean, never to be seen again. The beautiful selkie instead went on to marry Domnal, and the two lovers lived happily ever.

In eastern Seascan, there is the tale of the fisherman Eochu, whose wife, Griana, abandoned him after falling for a travelling merchant, leaving him as sole provider for their three young daughters. One day, whilst fetching salmon, Eochu began to weep, and his tears attracted the attention of a passing selkie, whose seal-husband and children had been slain by a bloodthirsty sea monster many months prior. The two fell in love, and were married shortly afterwards. Eochu&#39;s selkie bride proved to be an obedient homemaker and a loving stepmother, regularly entertaining his three daughters with songs and stories of the sea. Nonetheless, Eochu grew increasingly paranoid that, like Griana before her, she too would leave him in time, and return to her previous life amongst the waves.

Desperate to prevent his worst fears from being realised, Eochu first wrapped his wife&#39;s seal-skin in cloth, which he sealed it inside a locked wooden chest. Still unsatisfied, he later moved this chest, hiding it deep inside a nearby cave, although this too did little to ease his concerns. One night, Eochu awoke from uneasy sleep, and decided that to ensure his selkie wife never set fin in water again, he had no choice but to destroy her skin once and for all. While his wife and daughters slept, Eochu departed for the cave, where he set chest, cloth and skin alight. His mind finally at peace, Eochu headed home, where he was greeted by the wailing of his daughters, who had woken to the agonised cries of their seaborne stepmother, now reduced to ash and bone. The twice-heartbroken Eochu collected his wife&#39;s earthly remains, which he poured into the sea, at the same spot where they first met, and never married again.[[footnote]]This story is believed to be the source of the Brasilic saying, //never burn a selkie&#39;s skin//, a rough English equivilent being: //never look a gift horse in the mouth//.[[/footnote]]

Doubtlessly, the most infamous of Brasil&#39;s selkie tales is that of the Duchad, which features as a small component part of the wider Dyrmudic Cycle. The hunter Duchad, who hailed from the island&#39;s northmost province, longed for nothing more than a wife and son of his own. However, he found no partners amongst his own people, in part due to his drunkenness and violent temperament. Recalling the earlier legends of Domnal and Eochu, the hunter decided that if he could find no earthborn wife, one spawned of the gentle sea current would do just as well.

For an hour each day, Duchad waited patiently by the northern shore. A year passed, and his determination was rewarded one spring morning, when he spotted one of the majestic Seal Folk resting on a nearby rock, her sealskin carelessly tossed aside. After stealing her precious pelt, Duchad coerced the young selkie into marriage, despite her insisting that she already had a lover waiting beneath the waves. Some months later, the stranded seal maiden became pregnant with Duchad&#39;s child, though when his long-awaited son finally arrived, she refused to allow her husband to lay eyes on their child.

After forcing her to present his firstborn son, Duchad was horrified to discover that the child was neither fully boy nor beast, but a hybrid, with the fin and flippers of a seal and the face of an infant. So disgusted was Duchad by his son&#39;s appearance that, despite his wife&#39;s howls and pleas, he carried the child to nearby Loch Domhain, drowning him in its murky waters. Realizing that a waterborne wife could bear him no human children, Duchad returned her stolen skin, demanding that she return to the sea, and never again set foot upon dry land. However, the distraught selkie no longer held any desire to return home, and she instead wandered deep into the northern woods. Here, in her grief, she fashioned her own seal-skin into a rope, which she tied to a tree and used to hang herself.

Three nights later, Duchad was startled from slumber by a sound emerging from Loch Domhain, not unlike that produced by of a wailing infant. After setting out to investigate and finding nothing but rocks and pond scum, the hunter turned towards home, before feeling the cold, wet grip of a single webbed hand emerging from the loch. The hunter was dragged deep into the briny depths, his final sight being the vengeful eyes of his murdered son. The selkie-child&#39;s spirit is said to still haunt Loch Domhain, and for this reason, the area is generally avoided.

One subsequent story tells of a foolish young man, who strayed too close to the wailing loch, and as with Duchad, was dragged to his death. At his family&#39;s request, the future queen Arienn[[footnote]]Fourth of the seven wives of King Dyrmud the Ageless, eventually slain by a wild dog which mistook her wondrous voice for that of a swan.[[/footnote]], who possessed the most beautiful voice in all the land, sang for the wrathful wraith, temporarily charming it. This distracted the creature for long enough to allow the drowned boy&#39;s father and brothers to retrieve his still-warm body from the loch, ensuring he could receive a proper burial.
