The anomalous effects triggered by ill-considered use of the REISNO Cannon (categorized as SCP-001 in **TL-5956-X**) are analogous to anomalous effects categorized as [[[SCP-5243]]] in baseline reality.

On 8 September 2002, Site-43 experienced a cascade containment failure scenario. Every year, this event recurs as SCP-5243. These recurrences are in fact the original event; the affected facilities revert to their 2002 configurations, and any individuals killed by the containment failure are briefly resurrected so that they might re-enact their deaths. Should any of these individuals //not// die, a Class-CK reality restructuring event will occur wherein they did not die in 2002, but instead became suffused with esoteric energy and irrationally violent. This creates alternate timelines which can only be corrected if the next year&#39;s containment failure is handled correctly. SCP-5243 is also responsible for the creation of several secondary anomalies, the containment of which spurred the initial commissioning of the REISNO Cannon.

Simultaneous to the initial containment failure in 2002, Dr. D. Deering of the Applied Occultism Section perished for unknown reasons. He is restored to life each year by SCP-5243, and until 2013 always died in the same mysterious manner. Starting in 2013, he survived the events of 5243, for reasons which are also unknown; he is now executed annually by MTF personnel on the assumption that his survival could result in further Class-CK events.

The Temporal Anomalies Department has identified an incident of concern in alternate timeline **TL-5243-D** which may help to explain these events.

**Summary:** Containment of SCP-5243 failed for the fourth time on 8 September 2016 due to the survival of Dr. B. Del Olmo. As an alternate timeline had therefore been created, and as that timeline would inevitably be collapsed by the next successful containment, the annual execution of Dr. Deering became unnecessary. Director A. McInnis ordered that Dr. Deering instead be interrogated, to determine whether he knew why he had been killed by SCP-5243 every year since 2002, and why it was still resurrecting but no longer killing him. A partial transcript follows.

**Interview Log**

**Date:** 18 September 2016
**Investigating Agents:** D. Ibanez (Chief of Pursuit and Suppression), Dr. Xinyi Du (Chair of Quantum Supermechanics)

----

//[Excerpt begins.]//

**Dr. Deering:** I was sitting in my office, minding my own business, when I got... the call.

**Chief Ibanez:** The call.

**Dr. Deering:** Yes. A man spoke in my head, in the voice of my internal monologue, and told me he was me from the future. From a soon-to-be-dead timeline, just like the one we&#39;re in right now. He said that in 2002 something horrible was going to happen to my brother, and that in 2022 it was going to flat-out kill him — and that last part was going to be //my fault,// for trying to make things better. Well, you can imagine how that made me feel.

**Chief Ibanez:** Maybe this isn&#39;t as relatable an experience as you think.

**Dr. Deering:** Just listen, alright? He told me I could prevent it all. He told me there was going to be a massive containment breach, that it was going to kill seven people, that it was going to create all sorts of persistent and problematic anomalies. That my brother was going to get saddled with one of them for the rest of his life—

**Chief Ibanez:** Wait, you&#39;re Phil Deering&#39;s brother? All he got was a mirror monster that calls him names.

**Dr. Deering:** That&#39;s... okay, well, the voice said it was much worse than that. And he said that eventually I&#39;d try to fix it, and that would get him killed. But if I stopped the triggering event, none of it would happen. Nobody would... //Philip// wouldn&#39;t die. What was I supposed to do?

**Chief Ibanez:** Report it to me.

**Dr. Deering:** He told me not to! He said the only way to keep the timeline damage to a minimum was for me to dump the effluence out of AAF-D, stop it from blowing, stop the whole disaster from occurring. And that&#39;s what I was trying to do...

**Chief Ibanez:** Except you died.

**Dr. Deering:** Well, I don&#39;t remember that part.

**Chief Ibanez:** Of course you don&#39;t! But it&#39;s happened every single year until 2013, when suddenly we needed to start doing it... manually.

**Dr. Deering:** Wait, what?

**Chief Ibanez:** Never mind that. What do you think could have changed? Something in the future?

**Dr. Du:** Well...

**Chief Ibanez:** Yes, well what?

**Dr. Du:** Well, I did some consultation with Dr. McDoctorate at Site-87 before everything went pear-shaped.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]By 2016, this timeline&#39;s version of Site-43 has lost all communication with the wider Foundation.[[/span]] He had a theory. So, the version of Dr. Deering who called //our// Dr. Deering was from a dead timeline. When that timeline collapsed, his call was set in stone. It could never not happen.

**Chief Ibanez:** Sure, okay...

**Dr. Du:** What if there&#39;s an alternate timeline that //isn&#39;t// unstable? A persistent one? With another Dr. Deering, who&#39;s free to call his earlier self every year, over and over, and... kill him. Look at or listen to a cognitohazard, and kill them both using the link between them?

**Chief Ibanez:** Why would he do that?

**Dr. Du:** To //stop// our Dr. Deering from stopping the breach, I would imagine. Maybe it caused more problems than it solved.

**Chief Ibanez:** And why would that have ceased to happen in 2013?

**Dr. Deering:** Well, assuming he called me every year... maybe something happened to him, or the device that let him make the call?

//Chief Ibanez considers.//

**Chief Ibanez:** But if this alternate-you killed you-you — we need better terminology for this — then 5243 //didn&#39;t// kill you-you. So why is it bringing you back every year?

**Dr. Du:** Maybe it isn&#39;t. Maybe Dr. Deering isn&#39;t entangled with 5243, but with whatever is going on in the alternate timeline.

**Dr. Deering:** None of this is really a problem, though, is it?

**Chief Ibanez:** Why do you say that?

//Dr. Deering smiles.//

**Dr. Deering:** Because as long as you execute me every year, even if the breach keeps on breaching, my brother isn&#39;t going to die in 2022. I won&#39;t be around to do whatever it was I did.

**Chief Ibanez:** And that&#39;s good enough for you?

//Silence on recording.//

**Dr. Deering:** No. But what matters is that it&#39;s good enough for him.
