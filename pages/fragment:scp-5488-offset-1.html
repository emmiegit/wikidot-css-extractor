**Item#:** SCP-5488

**Rated:** Various

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5488 is to be locked away until the //fucking sun// engulfs the Earth and fries everybody to a crisp, which honestly can&#39;t happen soon enough to you cocksuckers. Put it in one of those bullshit folders we bought so many of in the eighties because someone in admin was screwing a paper distributor, and stick the folder in one of those combo lock safes that gangsters use to store their blow money.

Researchers who want to experiment with SCP-5488 should get permission from their parents, use all the right safety equipment, and get a responsible adult to supervise.
----
**Description:** SCP-5488 is a bunch of magic f███in stickers that look like those stickers you see on movies and games and shit lol they&#39;re really sticky. if u stick them on stuff they maek the stuff change to whatever is on them. the stickers I mean. if u wanna see tits in a workplace safety video or see iron man f██k spider man&#39;s aunt or show game of thrones to your parents its great. if u taek the stickers back off they stop working, which isn&#39;t great but why would you even. ur mom

The Foundation was alerted to a potentially unsecured anomaly when user &#34;falcon_ur_mom&#34; of the paranormal research website Parawatch claimed to own something &#34;legit magical.&#34; A Foundation wetworks team was dispatched to neutralize all members of Parawatch, disguising their deaths as a series of freak accidents. (Said &#39;accidents&#39; included decapitation when a helicopter crashed into a rooftop birthday party, burning to death in a crowded movie theatre, crashing a motor vehicle while receiving oral sex and succumbing to infection after botched genital piercing.) The primary suspect was detained at a Foundation black site, where the following interview was conducted:
[[div]]

[[div class=&#34;note&#34;]]
**Suspect:** I just want to go home.

**Agent:** //[laughs]// Kid, you don&#39;t //have// a home.

**Suspect:** What? I need to call my parents.

//[The agent slides a Manila envelope across the desk.]//

**Agent:** What parents?

//[The suspect opens the envelope; it reveals a pile of severed limbs, a mass of maggot-covered gore, and the heads of both his parents.]//

//[Twenty minutes of unintelligible gibbering omitted for brevity]//

**Suspect:** But //why?!// You haven&#39;t even asked me any questions!

//[The agent lights a cigarette.]//

**Agent:** Kid, this ain&#39;t about asking questions. It&#39;s about making you hurt.

//[The agent slowly and deliberately beats the suspect&#39;s head into the table until the entire room is covered with blood, bone fragments, and grey matter. The suspect dies weeping, and voids his bowels.]//

Dr. Cann,

Thank you for adding the new image for SCP-5488. Could you please take another look at the file, and perform the following tasks for me?

1. Confirm that the events now described there did not, in fact, take place;

2. Remove the new image from the file, and do not upload a new one;

3. Confirm that the file&#39;s contents have returned to normal, and update the description to account for this new phenomenon;

4. Pass that thing about overbuying Manila folders on to HR. It&#39;s worth looking into.

-- Dr. Helen Dray

P.S. I have already deleted an extensive description of a group orgy involving members of the research staff, which I&#39;m guessing replaced the original testing log. **Definitely remove the image before adding a new fifth paragraph to the file.** I don&#39;t want to be accused of uploading smut to the database. Again.

Dr. Dray,

I can confirm that none of... that, happened. I pulled the physical copies of the interview file to make certain. I&#39;m editing the document as we speak, but I&#39;ve hit a major snag. Every time I get rid of that image, it pops right back onto the screen. It&#39;s like we&#39;ve got a virus, or something; not even reverting the document to previous versions is working.

I&#39;ve got programmers looking into the issue. If they can&#39;t fix it, I think our next best option is to simply delete the file and make a new one. I&#39;ll let you know when I&#39;ve got more information.

This isn&#39;t about the document anymore, it&#39;s starting to affect the entirety of 43NET. Here&#39;s an excerpt from [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5281 SCP-5281-D]&#39;s file, now apparently &#34;Rated G&#34;:

[[div class=&#34;note&#34;]]
**Specialist Zaman:** So, why is it that you eat... children.

**SCP-5281:** Eat children?! My good man, you are //very// confused. I am //bonhomme sept-heures!// My only role is to escort naughty youngsters back to their homes when they stay out past seven o&#39;clock.

**Specialist Zaman:** Huh. Could&#39;ve sworn you ate children.

**SCP-5281:** I also do charity work.
[[/div]]

That guy //definitely// ate children, so.

I&#39;m already getting a massive flood of complaints. Fucking fix me up and I&#39;ll show you the time of your life in bed, you naughty boy. I&#39;ll bet you can&#39;t wait to enact an XD-Class scenario on these amazing tits, you sexy stud! So get that sweet ass in gear or you&#39;ll be in for a spanking tonight.

Unless you want that.

Dr. Cann,

The anomaly is affecting our communications network now. I have taken the liberty of forwarding my previous message to HR for review, and it is my duty to inform you that conflict resolution and counselling services are available at all Foundation Sites.

We&#39;re backing up all unaffected files on a secure server, but I don&#39;t know if that will help. I&#39;m s-s-s-scared, Nick! The big bad computer monster is eating up all my word friends, and pooping them out as //bad// word friends! Be my super-duper hero, Nick, and stop the big bad computer monster.

Helen,

The whiny bitches in my team confirm that their emails are also permafucked. But their hacky-wacky powers can&#39;t defeat the no-no words! Helen, it&#39;s just you and I against the world, now, but through the power of love I know we can fix this. WE NEED TO HARD RESET SCIPNET. Tomas says that&#39;s the only way to get rid of the image. We&#39;ll be stuck using typewriters for the next little while.

Mommy, can I put the computerboxes to sleep?

Short sentences. Good idea.
