I have very long legs. Very long.  Long enough to stretch over a canyon, when I want them to. When I need them to.  And long fingers as well. The fingers of a pianist, or a strangler. Long and slender. Made for choking. Not a pianist.

I laugh, surprising myself. There is so little cause for laughing these days, especially since Ms. Sweetie went to the trashcan.  I used to like Ms. Sweetie. She was kind to me. So few of the others were kind to me. Called me an afterthought. But she was kind to everyone. But not anymore.

My legs stretched, climbing up the forested foothills, long fingers wrapping around trees and pulling me along.  I rather distantly note how the branches died where I squeezed them, but I was used to that. It was what I did after all. Kill. Remove. Destroy.

I correct the errors made by my creator. All of them. I&#39;ve been marking them off as I go. I&#39;ve nearly finished. All nineteen.

I stretch and warp, knowing I’m going somewhere, but not where. Well, no. I know where. To them. To all of them. One at a time.  But they were moving together now.  Drawing close to each other. So close… 

I wonder if Mr. Redd will be there. We two have a score to settle.  And I did have very, very long fingers. Fingers made for choking, I remind myself.

Long fingers. Very, very long. Very ready. Ready to choke. Ready to squeeze the life out of anyone. Anything. To fix things. To fix everything that was broken.

Mr. Redd and I //did// have a score to settle after all.
