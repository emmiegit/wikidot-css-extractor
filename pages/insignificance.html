The Devil was poking at Diego again, but that&#39;s fine. Sometimes it&#39;s hard to sleep because of him. Prick&#39;s been on Diego&#39;s back for as far as he can remember, delivering poisonous remarks and harsh comments, and sometimes these affect him, but he persists.

Diego was born and raised in [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/dossier-lph Little Havana], and he can tolerate it. Diego is a Rum Runner working for the near-defunct branch of the Chicago Spirits still operating in the city, doing the dirty work that his bosses won&#39;t. That&#39;s fine, he doesn&#39;t complain. Diego doesn&#39;t really complain, it&#39;s not his business to do so. He obeys his orders and he does his best to see them through to the end.

Diego, frankly, is miserable.

When he has time, he drinks. He likes drinking. Sometimes he gets angry when he drinks, but that&#39;s fine, Diego doesn&#39;t mind it. Or he hopes he doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s not all bad though, he enjoys his days, sometimes. One of Diego&#39;s favorite activities is to spend time together with his remaining family; that is, his mom. He knows he&#39;s not the best son a mother could ask for, but he tries to be there.

For his day to day job, Diego smuggles drugs, booze, and illicit items. He also sometimes kills people. He doesn&#39;t like killing people that much. Diego has always wanted a proper education, but the Marshall, Carter, and Dark Academy is too expensive for him to afford, and he&#39;s not the artsy type either. Dreams of studying at a prestigious academy with welcoming people pop into his head often. Diego really wants to become smart, smarter than he currently is. To impress his mother, for once.

The claws of the Devil dig into his back. The Devil is right though. He almost always is. Diego feels dumb, very dumb.

Fret not! Diego never gives up. In fact, things are looking up. He&#39;s been working hard, real hard, and he might just land the job position he always had dreamt of: being the personal henchman of Ruthless Alejandro. Well, it&#39;s not a job, per se, but a position. He&#39;s been doing his work and he&#39;ll be rewarded for it, Diego knows it. If he achieves this, he might even be able to leave the Havana one day, or maybe even change it for the better.

This was not his only win for the week though. A pretty girl he&#39;s been eyeing, studying at the Hansarp School of the Arts, wants to meet him for a beach date. Diego is ecstatic! Why wouldn&#39;t he? She&#39;s been nice to him, very nice. Before long, he scrounges up the materials to make a small bracelet for her. Diego can be the artsy type for Rina, if he wants to.

The week goes by in a flash. The Devil on Diego&#39;s back has been trying to put him down, but it wont work, especially when he&#39;s had such a good week! 

The date with Rina was incredible! They talked for hours and hours, swam, drank mojitos in the burning sun, and even shared a kiss! As Diego was leaning for it, the Devil tried to scratch at Rina, but thankfully, nobody else notices him. He can&#39;t do any harm to them, ha-ha!

After the wonderful time at the beach, Diego was tipsy, maybe a bit too tipsy, and he lashed out at his mother when he arrived home. His mother started crying, an-

d, no! Diego can change! Don&#39;t you dare say something! As he became aware of his fuck-up, Diego went and apologized to her. He also shed a tear, or two. She eventually forgave him, and they embraced. He realizes these things can happen, and it&#39;s not a reason to not try.

Diego and his mom had always had a complicated relationship. Diego loved his mom, but a lot of the time they disagreed on trivial things. Diego always had tried to make up for it though, in any way he could, especially if he was the one to sour up the mood of either of them. He had moved back into his childhood home a few years ago, as his mother had started having trouble living alone. 

Anyway... enough reminiscing, maybe Diego didn&#39;t act the best way in that situation. You learn from your mistakes, or so they say. He doesn&#39;t have much time to think about it, though. Diego has just got some amazing news! His promotion might come sooner than he expected, but he has one job to complete beforehand. A delivery to some important person in Miami. This is the first time Diego will actually leave his home town for once, and he can&#39;t wait.

As the day rolls around, he wakes up early, and prepares to do his most important mission yet. Diego and his two fellow Rum Runners nearly got caught when warping to Key Largo by a few feds, but by the time the hats even realized what was going on, both Diego and his associates were in a car to Lauderdale. 

The delivery went well, and to celebrate, Diego went and got himself shit-faced at one lonely bar off the street. Maybe not one of his brightest ideas, because as soon as he stumbled out of the bar, one too many rowdy comments led him to feel the cold embrace of concrete as Diego had gotten into a fight with two other people, leaving him limping on the floor until sunrise. 

Beaten, he stumbled back home, cursing at himself for his negligence and promising to do better. Boss is pleased though, and, to his surprise, he offers him the job he&#39;s always wanted, starting next week. Oh, the joy! But, for Diego, it&#39;s not all roses and sunshine. He&#39;s got all of these bruises and cuts on him from the fight. How will he explain this to his mom? Rina? They don&#39;t know of what he actually does, day to day. Maybe some concealer will help, Diego foolishly thinks. 

Thankfully, he fools his mom enough. Her sight worsened with age, and Diego manages to avoid any suspicions on his part, but it&#39;s not as easy with Rina, she&#39;s got a keen eye; She&#39;s a smart girl, and she notices his bruises instantly. 

Diego tries to explain them in any way he can, but Rina is not fooled, and she becomes scared. Rina was a sheltered girl, living a pompous lifestyle compared to what Diego had learned was normal for his entire life, and this whole ordeal made her frightened for both her and Diego&#39;s safety. Another problem caused by his drinking, damn it!

Rina hasn&#39;t talked to Diego for a few days since then.

Shut up! Diego can change! And, you know how? Diego will make it up to Rina, and buy her a nice bouquet. A really nice one. And maybe some sweets too. Diego can care for people, he&#39;s not a bad man. 

Emotions be damned for now, though. Tomorrow is a big day. Diego will attend a meeting between the Chicago Rum Runners and a rival faction, side-by-side with Alejandro. He makes sure to look as good as he can beforehand, and buys a nice hat to make himself look more classy. 

That night, he has trouble sleeping; something plagues his mind, but he doesn&#39;t know what. It&#39;s probably just the anxiety. It&#39;ll all go well, and he knows it. Diego doesn&#39;t have to worry. 

As the day rolls around, he rushes out of the house without a second thought, forgetting to even tell his mother where he was going, dressed in his sharpest suit, gun on his hip, and ready to own the day. A bout of rain had befallen the Havana in the worst possible moment, but with a bit of dashing and ducking beneath places where he could be shielded by the rain, Diego got to the place fairly dry; a big, luxurious seaside villa, where the meeting was soon about to proceed.

Diego, for a change, felt a little bit better. Even if he had made a fair share of mistakes over the past two weeks, things are looking up for him. He felt a sense of purpose when he was around all of these important people.

The time for the meeting came, and he was sitting on the side of Alejandro, with five other people; on the other side, some rival gang he&#39;s only really heard bad things about. Their leader, Hanse, and Alejandro are exchanging words and discussing terms for a potential pact between the two gangs, but something must&#39;ve ticked off one or the other; Diego wasn&#39;t fully aware of what had happened, as he was paying attention to protecting Alejandro, but in a split second, both parties had started yelling.

Diego, worried, tried to break the tension between the two factions, he could be the hero of the day, maybe! One of the henchmen on Hanse&#39;s side pulled out his handgun, and that&#39;s when things got a bit too real.

&#34;Hey!&#34; yelled out Diego &#34;Let&#39;s all just cal-

//Bang! Bang! Bang!//

Diego tried to take a stance, be the hero for once. One fatal mistake.

As more people drew their guns, the room filled with the noise of gun shots and smoke all around. Diego was on the ground, limping, dying in a pool of his own blood. Is that how he goes? In such a freak event? What were the past few weeks for? How will his mother - oh, he forgot about her this morning! How will she react, how will Rina react? How are they all going to react?

Diego had met his end that day, as nothing more than an unnamed goon in someone else&#39;s story. That&#39;s it.</textarea></pre>
