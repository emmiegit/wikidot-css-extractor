**Notice:** SCP-7034’s description is solely sourced from the account of Senior Researcher Richard Battaglia. The file will be updated accordingly upon Foundation access to SCP-7034.

[[include component:image-block name=https://live.staticflickr.com/7188/6887434169_e2e09a2d38_b.jpg|align=right|width=45%|caption=Interstate Highway I-85]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** The exit ramp purportedly leading to SCP-7034 has been temporarily barred from public access for Foundation assessment. Further action is pending discovery of a conclusive entrance to SCP-7034, or lack thereof.

The Foundation is conducting an ongoing appraisal of the United States Interstate Highway System in an attempt to discern potential access points to SCP-7034. If necessary, efforts may expand to be global in scope.

Information regarding missing persons cases related to the United States Interstate Highway System is to be suppressed.

**Description:** SCP-7034 is an extradimensional space of indeterminate length, unverified composition, and unknown features.

According to the sole account of SCP-7034, the space resembles a controlled-access interstate highway. It contains a single stretch of paved road, featuring eight lanes cordoned by guard-rails on each side. Other features, including those present beyond the guard railing, are indiscernible due to a heavy smog that lays over the area. Electronic signals, such as cellular service or internet access, are apparently impeded inside SCP-7034.

SCP-7034 is highly congested with traffic, with all lanes occupied by vehicles of various make and model. The length of this congestion, including its end point, is unknown. Attempts to identify these vehicles via license plate numbers have been met with varying degrees of success. A number of automobiles align with missing persons reports, though some are geographically disparate from the supposed access point to SCP-7034.

The means by which SCP-7034 can be accessed remain unclear. The Foundation became aware of SCP-7034 following the disappearance of Senior Researcher Richard Battaglia, who entered SCP-7034 after emerging from a tunnel while commuting on interstate highway I-85 on December 3rd, 2022. Battaglia established contact with the Foundation several hours into the congestion, suspecting that he was experiencing an anomaly.

**Addendum.7034.1:** Received Transmissions

The following are transcripts of recordings sent from Richard Battaglia to the Foundation via an emergency-use one-way communicator, a paratechnical device issued to select personnel in the event that traditional communication is impossible.

Okay, we’re green. This is Senior Researcher Richard Battaglia, Area-179, Department of Containment. Don’t know who at the mothership is going to be receiving this, but the emergency kit paid off. None of you can make fun of me for lugging it around anymore, okay? (//Laughs//)

If this is just an ordinary traffic jam, uh, just disregard. You can take all the piss you want once I get back.

Not sure where I am. I’m on my way home to Gainesville for Christmas and it’s been awhile since I was on these roads. Uh, about… I want to say, an hour past state lines, I got out of a tunnel on I-85, and rolled up to a detour like normal, thinking “Shit, of course.”

But I’ve been stuck in traffic for… it’s got to be ten hours now. Hard to tell with the fog. We’re moving forward, but barely. Phone doesn’t work. Pissed in a bottle twice already. I’m about half a tank full, so I should be good there, but–

(//A truck horn is heard in the distance.//)

Again, Dr. Richard Battaglia, Department of Containment.  I came off exit 242 on I-85. I&#39;ll keep in touch.

Six in the morning. Still as dark as it was at midnight. Fog’s not lifting, either. I tried to– (//Coughing//) Shit. I tried to roll the window down but there’s this fucking awful smell. Don’t know if it’s exhaust or what. Christ. (//Battaglia slaps his chest, coughing more.//)

 I fell asleep a little, but the row ahead moved forward, like, an inch, so this knucklehead behind me just laid on the fucking horn. (//Pause//) Cars are just building up, you can see it in the rearview.

Exit 242, I-85. Send someone.

Ten o’clock. The sky– not even exaggerating– the sky is still fucking black. I thought it was night at first, but– (//Battaglia groans in frustration//)

I should be hugging my kid now, you know. Had a whole… a whole surprise day planned out for him since daddy was finally coming home from work. And I know she’s been getting him excited for it, too. (//Sighs//) What a fucking joke.

 … I’m tired. Everyone here has to be. Staying awake with an energy drink and some old nu-metal CDs I haven’t listened to since college. Yeah, I busted out the CDs. I’m trying to squeeze my way onto the shoulder, but I don’t think there is one. Just a far lane that’s as packed as the others.

This guy just got rear-ended, uh, just now. Must have fallen asleep or something. Jesus. He’s moving forward now, but wow. Wow.

Should be fine for another few hours, I think. I’ve stayed up longer, and this caffeine’s putting work in. Other than that… same old, same old. Kiddo’s probably up and asking what the surprise is. If I had to guess, Bree’s called me at least a hundred times.

(//Coughing//) Christ, are you fucking kidding me? I can’t even step out of the goddamned car. Exhaust. Fumes. It&#39;s everywhere. I mean, take one breath and the tears start welling while your lungs feel like they’re seconds away from popping. Soon as I opened the door, just barely, so I didn’t hit the car next to me, these fucks behind me flipped their lids. Honking, throwing their hands up, waving me back.

(//Battaglia punches the wheel, groaning in anger.//)

How the fuck is this fair? I mean, on my way home. On my break. After a year of… nothing but paperwork and bullshit, I can’t even spend time with my fucking family!

Sorry about… what I think I sent last night. I forget what I said. But it’s been two days now. On the dot. I’m living off a sip of water every six hours, no clue what anyone else is doing to fuel themselves. Haven’t slept more than an hour before someone lays on the horn. It&#39;s all they seem to care about. Just moving forward.

(//Sighs//) The part of this that really fucks me up, is that if we *all* stepped out, we’d be able to communicate with one another and… and maybe figure something out. I don’t know. I’ve never talked to people. Organized things. I thought by now… you’d think someone would have fucking done something, right?

Going to see if I can talk to the driver next to me.

(//Sounds of a window rolling down are heard. For the next ten minutes, wind, horns, and engines are heard above the sound of Battaglia speaking to another individual. The audio is largely irrelevant or indiscernible. The window rolls up.//)

Don’t know if you got that. Been shouting through the windows the past few hours. Rolling them up and down every few minutes to offset the smog. Guy next to me is named Micheal, older guy. Got here off a different highway entirely, I-70. I&#39;ll get you his plate, hold on.

So, we’re planning something. I’m in the lane furthest to the right. If I was able to talk to him, he could talk to the driver next to him, and so on. Eventually, we’ll have an entire row of cars that are willing to get out of their cars, right? And maybe if we all stop, the lane behind us will too. (//Pause//) Or they won’t, and they’ll run us down the second the doors open. Worst case scenario? I have a gun.

 (//Exhales//) I just need this to work. I’m starving, I’m… fucking scared. Bree’s probably losing her mind over this. Yeah, it’s not like you would fucking tell her what’s happening, would you? We just need this to work.

So… Micheal got through to the person next to him. And they’re getting through to the car on their left. We might be able to pull this off.

(//Laughs//) Wow, that went better than I expected. I’m laying down in the backseat right now. Fucking finally. Let me, uh… I’m figuring out where to start. (//Coughs//)

I hopped out of the car as soon as we stopped, gun in my pocket. Immediately the idiot behind me slammed on the horn, but they cut that out when they saw Micheal open his door too, and the woman next to him, and the one next to her. And then eventually, everyone in our row was standing in the road. The fumes choked the hell out of us, and… it’s fucking scorching out there, too, but no one got back in.

Then that row behind us funneled out. Ordinary people, each of them just as scared and tired and unwashed as the rest of us. That was… a major relief, honestly. I was half expecting monsters or something. (//Laughs//)

We weren’t able to stay out in the open for more than ten minutes. Some folded in less. The air’s too much. But we did organize a plan. People who wanted to move forward, they did so. Kept driving. The rest of us set up our cars in a sort of barricade along the road, leaving only the middle lane open for people to pass through. Such a fucking relief to be able to turn the car off and lay down in the back seat.

 And… that’s it. There’s no long term plan. I mean, there can’t be. We’ve secured some supplies from tractor trailers who’ve come by. Warm water and soda. But we’re screwed when it comes to anything else. Without refrigeration or electricity, we’ll last a few days, at most. The air outside is a problem, but I’m struggling to think of a solution. We either suffocate in a cramped car, or choke on exhaust. Problem for tomorrow.

 Slept for the first time in days. I mean, I really slept. An eighteen-wheeler joined up, and I’m recording this while sweating my ass off in the back. Somehow, it’s still cooler here than it is out there.

We have a big enough space for a group to talk, at least for a bit. There’s no consensus on what&#39;s happening here. Some say it’s purgatory. Others aren’t convinced it&#39;s supernatural. One woman thinks it&#39;s a dream. I’m… I’m trying my hardest to tell everyone to keep their heads up, that help is coming, but it&#39;s been four days now, and I don’t know if it is.

I know these are going through, but I&#39;m assuming you haven’t found a way in yet. Or if you have, you’re too far back in that fucking jam to reach me. I’m going to try and keep our group together, so if you’re there, you’ll know where to find me.

(//Shuffling sounds//)

Hey. Late message, I know. Was busy today. Got lowered over the railing.

There was about three hundred feet of rope– still couldn’t see the bottom. Just fog, and a smell that got worse the lower you went. Hotter, too. I puked three… four times.

I wanted to unhook myself, honestly. Just fall into the mist and see where I ended up, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I still want to get out of here, man. I love you– I mean. Fuck. (//Voice weakens//) I love my family. I’m going to see them again. I know I will. But if I don’t move forward, get back on the road, I’m going to die. We’re fucking starving. We have some water, but… we’re wasting our time in one place. Have to move forward. Have to.

 (//Battaglia sobs for an extended duration before collecting himself.//)

When they pulled me up, and I told them... I told them there was nothing down there, I could see the same realization settling in on their faces. (//Pause//) Some were still optimistic, sure. The number of incoming cars had slowed down to the point where you could feasibly ride along the far lane without issue. According to my car, I drove just under 190 miles in two days, in completely stagnated traffic. With a clear road, I could do that in a few hours. Maybe there was a way out, the way we came in. I took someone’s motorcycle, and just set off.

 I rode for hours, but… you can’t recognize anything in here. No landmarks, no markings. Just a road that stretched on, forever. No matter how far I got, I was… here. But even with a helmet and a mask, the smog was too much. Had to stop and lay down twice. Could have gotten killed.

Nothing had to be said when I got back to the group. Some came out of their cars. Most just stared at me through the windows. They all wore those same tired, helpless faces, only this time, even under the masks, there wasn’t a shred of hope left on any of them.

People are starting to leave. Wondering whether or not I should follow. Had a meeting in the rig, decided it was for the best. We can cooperate all we’d like, but we’re wasting time we could be using to move forward. It’s not like we’re not in our cars most of the day anyways. God knows how much shit I inhaled yesterday.

There’s what lays ahead, and whatever sits at the end of it, even if it&#39;s nothing. I could stay here and starve. I could hurl myself over the edge of the railing, too.

I’m doing this for you, Shaun. Bree. I love you. I’m going to see you again.

**Battaglia:** I always promised my wife I’d never do that. My brother was a December baby, I totally understood.

**Micheal:** Yeah. (//Pause//) God, you wonder how some of these other folks are doing it? The people who didn’t stop, where are they getting their water?

**Battaglia:** Maybe there’s a rest-stop. Little taco-bell or something.

(//Micheal laughs.//)

**Battaglia:** Um, honestly, if they didn’t do something similar to what we did, just to refuel, then they probably didn’t make it. We’ll see, I guess.

**Micheal:** Yes, we will. At least the traffic cleared up.

**Battaglia:** For now, yeah. That was the worst, man. When I was out there I kept telling myself that the next time I’d fall asleep it’d be in my own bed, right next to my wife.

Hey, I’m… finally on the road again. It came down to four of us in the group. Micheal, myself, and two sisters, college girls. We’re all riding together. Not in the same car, you know, but… we’re around. Easier in case something happens. Like if this piece of shit car dies.

The road’s clear. No traffic. Still black as hell, but we’re covering ground. We did over… 400 miles today. There’s so many cars parked on the sides. I don’t know if they did something similar to what we did or— or they’re dead, but if they didn’t have water, then…

I don’t know what we’re going to find. I’m not… remotely prepared for bodies, and death, and all of that. I never saw a man die in my twenty years at the Foundation. That’s got to be a record. But all we can do is move forward. There has to be an end. I can’t just… I’m going to hold out for as long as I can.

Saw some fuck with a flat tire stuck in the middle of the lane. I think he was part of our group from a few days back. Tried to flag us down, but he’s more weight. We’re already hurting for fuel. It’s not like we couldn’t have helped him. Micheal has a spare in the back. We have to move it from view when we get a chance– saw someone get raided the other night for theirs.

There’s easier targets to hold up than the guy who can fire back. Unless they have a spare, or take one from someone who does, they’re screwed, but that’s how it is here. I feel like scum.

We’re funneling into it. My car gave out. I’m sure you can hear that noise– it’s me getting pushed by whoever’s behind me. Just… a slow approach into whatever the hell’s in that tunnel. I already had my breakdown. Punched the shit out of my window, broke my hand, I think. I’ve just…accepted it now. That’s either my way out, or it’s over.

If I come out the other side, I want this burned.

(//Another bang. The echo of engines and horns becomes louder, drowning out the audio.//)

Going in now.
