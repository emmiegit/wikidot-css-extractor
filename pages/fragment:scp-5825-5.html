**Item #:** SCP-5825

**Object Class:** --Safe-- Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-5825 is to be kept in a standard containment locker in Site-32. Any individuals under the effects of SCP-5825 are to be administered class A amnestics.-- Research into SCP-5825 is currently headed by Researcher Molly Śląski.

The remaining pieces of SCP-5825 are to be kept in a standard containment locker in Site-32. Attempts to reconstruct SCP-5825 must be approved by Researcher Śląski, Site Director Hargreeves, and the Ethics Committee.

**Description:** SCP-5825 --is-- was a vinyl record that contains as of yet unidentified recordings of 20th century wind band pieces, most by the composer Percy Grainger. Analysis of the recordings indicates all tracks on the record are played by the same ensemble.

When an individual hears the contents of SCP-5825 played through a record player, they enter a manic state, attempting to obtain the record at all costs. When coherent, most individuals affected by SCP-5825 express a desire to go to the ocean, often attempting to drown themselves and SCP-5825 in the nearest body of water. This effect usually wears off within an hour after hearing the record.

Research into the exact effects of SCP-5825 is still underway.

**Addendum 5825-A:** During routine testing of SCP-5825, an unrelated containment breach at Site-32 caused SCP-5825 to shatter. Test subject D-2934 was unharmed, but Researcher Śląski was injured by a flying shard. No grievous harm came to Researcher Śląski, and she will return to work on researching SCP-5825 following a physical examination and debriefing of the containment breach.
