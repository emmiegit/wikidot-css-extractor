**Item #**: SCP-3583

**Object Class**: --Neutralized-- Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures**: As all attempts to take SCP-3583 into custody have resulted in it decohering into its component parts, and a new instance manifesting within three days, containment is focused on supervising its behavior, and on information control. Foundation personnel have been embedded among the employees of SCP-3583&#39;s preferred school; for monitoring purposes, 3 Foundation personnel are to embark on SCP-3583 at the end of each school day. Except for purposes of approved experimentation into Behavior Pattern SCP-3583-2, no more than 4 personnel are to embark.

Standard Internet-monitoring bots have been set to watch video-sharing sites for further copies of videos made from within SCP-3583; all such copies are to be taken down.

**Description:** SCP-3583 is a schoolbus which displays multiple anomalous properties, the most evident of which is that it is autonomous.[[footnote]]The driver&#39;s seat is empty at all times, and an unknown force prevents it from being occupied; similarly, the steering wheel and brake and accelerator pedals do not respond to manipulation.[[/footnote]] As well, close inspection reveals that it is composed of a wide variety of mismatched schoolbus parts, held together by an unknown force.

SCP-3583 associates itself with [REDACTED] Public School, in the town of [REDACTED], Oklahoma. At 3:20pm each school day, SCP-3583 manifests in a random location in the bus zone outside the school, opens its door, and waits 7 minutes. During this interval, a maximum of 56 children may embark of their own volition (a maximum of 8 adults will also be able to embark, with each adult apparently being considered equal to two children). If, after 7 minutes, SCP-3583 does not contain its desired number of passengers, it begins to honk its horn. This produces a cognitohazardous effect whereby all children within hearing range will enter a fugue state, abandon their other activities, and embark on SCP-3583. If there are insufficient children within hearing range, the horn will become progressively louder.

Once SCP-3583 contains its desired number of passengers, it will demanifest from the bus zone and enter an anomalous region of space (henceforth SCP-3583-A). SCP-3583-A is recognizably based on the town of [REDACTED], but with multiple divergences, including but not limited to violent civil unrest, seismic and volcanic activity, frequent high-voltage electrical discharges, inconsistent gravity, building fires, predatory megafauna, open military conflict with public mass executions, and animate cadavers of varying degrees of decomposition and mutilation.

In SCP-3583-A, SCP-3583 will engage in one of two distinct behavior patterns, depending on how many adults are present.

**Behavior pattern 1 (0-4 adults):** SCP-3583 will drive through SCP-3583-A until it reaches the counterpart of an individual child&#39;s residence.[[footnote]]Although standard schoolbus dropoff points exist, SCP-3583 ignores them.[[/footnote]] There, it will return to normal space, and allow the child to disembark. It will then return to SCP-3583-A, proceed to the counterpart of another child&#39;s residence, and continue in this fashion until all the children have disembarked; afterward, it will deliver any adults to their individual residences in the same fashion. Once the last adult has disembarked, SCP-3583 will demanifest.

**Behavior pattern 2 (5-8 adults):** SCP-3583 will emerge from SCP-3583-A at the sites of historic mass casualty events (identified sites include the World Trade Center, Khao Lak, Pompeii, and Nanjing) in the days or weeks prior to their occurrence. 
[[footnote]]Passengers have been able to ping Foundation satellites and servers as applicable, but satellite and server records from the relevant eras do not indicate the pings in question; similarly, video taken from within SCP-3583 has been found to be a 100% match for all available historical footage, but no such footage has been found to contain SCP-3583.
[[/footnote]]  SCP-3583 will then drive around the site for between 45 and 150 minutes, after which it will engage in Behavior Pattern 1.

&gt; **Interview log 3583-08F2X; interview subject: Principal ████████**
&gt; 
&gt; **Principal ████████:** We expected you a lot sooner. We sent a half-dozen reports back when it first showed up. What took you so long?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Patel:** Uh, we looked into it, and it turns out that, uh, somewhere along the line – before they got to us, I should emphasize – the reports were processed by a person who decided you were, uh, intoxicated and hallucinating.
&gt; 
&gt; **Principal ████████:** ...that son of a bitch. That son of a bitch! I&#39;ll have you know I&#39;ve been clean for fifteen years five months! Who&#39;s the bastard who says I fell off the wagon? Was it [REDACTED]?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Patel:** Really, I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t tell you that. I don&#39;t actually know, and even if I did I couldn&#39;t tell you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Principal ████████:** &lt;sigh&gt; Okay, fine. So if it wasn&#39;t our reports, how&#39;d you find out about it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Patel:** Some of the kids started posting videos online.
&gt; 
&gt;  **Principal ████████:** Oh shit.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Patel:** Yeah, tell me about it. Took us a good week to scrub them all.
&gt; 
&gt;  **Principal ████████:** You can //do// that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Patel:** We can do a lot of stuff.
&gt; 
&gt;  **Principal ████████:** But not actually stop it from coming back, I guess.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Patel:** Well... doesn&#39;t look like it, no.
&gt; 
&gt;  **Principal ████████:** How far did you get it before it fell apart?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Patel:** The first time, we actually got it into the secured garage.  But now it lets go as soon as we&#39;ve hauled it off the school property.
&gt; 
&gt;  **Principal ████████:** I could&#39;ve warned you, y&#39;know. We did try getting rid of it ourselves, at first. Clamped its wheels and towed it off to the dump. Poof, bus parts all over the road.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Patel:** One of our people suggested we legally expand your school&#39;s area, see if that&#39;d do anything, but– 
&gt; 
&gt;  **Principal ████████:** Oh, is //that// why there were surveyors all over the place last month?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Patel:** Yeah, we figured it&#39;d be a good idea to start small before we got into expropriating all your neighbors. Didn&#39;t make a difference, but, uh, enjoy your extra 1000 square feet.
&gt; 
&gt;  **Principal ████████:** Ha. Of all the things I expected from you Men-in-Black assholes, space for a new playground wasn&#39;t one of them. Halfway thought you might shut us down!
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Patel:** We did seriously consider that, actually.
&gt; 
&gt;  **Principal ████████:** … oh.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Patel:** But if we do that, if you&#39;re not here, it might just find some other school. We can&#39;t take that risk. So we&#39;ll embed some of our people in your staff, to keep an eye on it.
&gt; 
&gt;  **Principal ████████:** How many?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Patel:** Uh... probably not more than six?
&gt; 
&gt;  **Principal ████████:** I don&#39;t have the budget for that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Patel:** No, we&#39;ll handle their salaries.
&gt; 
&gt;  **Principal ████████:** Huh. Must be nice.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Patel:** Uh... I guess so? Anyway, before I leave, I wanted to thank you.
&gt; 
&gt;  **Principal ████████:** Hm?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Patel:** For being so reasonable about this. A lot of the time, if we have to leave the, uh, //anomaly// on site, the locals get upset.
&gt; 
&gt;  **Principal ████████:** Well, yeah. If we really wanted it gone, we wouldn&#39;t have stopped reporting it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Patel:** My bosses&#39;ll want an explanation for that.
&gt; 
&gt;  **Principal ████████:** You can&#39;t just tell &#39;em we don&#39;t mind having it here?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Patel:** Hey, come on. Would //you// accept that?
&gt; 
&gt;  **Principal ████████:** &lt;sigh&gt; Look. Whatever it is, it pretty clearly //wants// to be a schoolbus. And it&#39;s not doing //that// bad a job. I mean, hell dimension aside, it&#39;s got a perfect safety record. Been doing this five years, and it&#39;s never so much as had a kid get hurt in a fight. I&#39;ve had living drivers who can&#39;t say that. And... okay, look, can I be honest with you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Patel:** Please do?
&gt; 
&gt;  **Principal ████████:** Do you realize how much a schoolbus //costs//? Just the bus, not even counting the fuel and the maintenance and the driver? With what we&#39;ve saved since this thing showed up, we were able to hire a //music teacher//.
