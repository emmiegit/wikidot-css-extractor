**Item #:** SCP-187-DE

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** On the basis of information which has most likely fallen into the hands of one or more organizations and Groups of Interest, SCP-187-DE will be transferred between the designated DE-sites in a random pattern and at random time periods, which should however be no longer than six months. The eligible sites may be taken from document //MAT-MIG-84773//. These transfers must take place under high security measures and secrecy.

In the designated sites, a living unit created from two connected standard humanoid containment chambers must be made available, equipped with the objects preferred by SCP-187-DE; personal items may be allowed for SCP-187-DE after a review by the respective site control. The established curriculum for the education of SCP-187-DE must be followed by appropriate personnel at all times, including assessments of theoretical and practical nature.

The implanted Scranton Reality Anchor &#34;Homecomer&#34; must be checked for functionality every month, while making sure that SCP-187-DE is in a good state of mind. In the rest of the time the device remains in the &#34;Fixed-Mode&#34; to prevent an unwanted change to another plane of reality. (For technical information on the device, see document //MAT-HMK-C0122.4//)

Due to the unavoidable decay of the umbilical cord tissue of D-92013 up to the present time, stocks of it must always be present at the sites and be bred if necessary. SCP-187-DE normally shows no rejection of the tissue, but as mild medicaments as possible must be added for safety reasons to prevent a rejection. (For the medical procedures of an exchange of umbilical tissue refer to document //MAT-UMB-1.1// continuous)

**Description:** SCP-187-DE is a 13 year old girl with light blonde hair, petite physique, a weight of 43 kilograms and a height of 1.59 meters. Since a daily data collection of SCP-187-DE was started before its birth, a detailed documentation of the physical, social and mental development can be found in the database associated with the anomaly (//COMP.log.187-DE//) after proper clearance. Genetically there are no anomalies, the genome is a hundred percent human, so that the assumption can be made, that the properties of the SCP originate in the contact between D-92031 (the biological mother) and SCP-███-DE. Its antimemetic capabilities are partially similar to those of SCP-187-DE. D-92031, a convicted murderer, was at the time of the meeting with SCP-███-DE seven months pregnant.

The &#34;normal state&#34; of SCP-187-DE is the existence on another plane of reality, which cannot be completely described. Cameras and recording equipment transported by SCP-187-DE into the other plane record only blackness and/or absolute silence, save for pictures of SCP-187-DE itself or sounds caused by it, and only if the respective device for visual recordings emits its own light. SCP-187-DE, however, does perceive normal reality on this plane, and can orientate itself and move accordingly, but cannot take actions. It describes the states of the other world as &#34;temperatureless&#34; and claims it does not need to breathe nor feel any pain there. Additionally, the anomaly talked about different layers of reality, which may indicate an intuitive perception of Hume levels.

Any items directly touching SCP-187-DE can be moved in both directions without taking any visible physical damage. Human test subjects which have contact to SCP-187-DE during its transfer have an extremely traumatic experience which include Apnea, the feeling of detachment from the own body and an experience of &#34;unimportance in relation to possibilities&#34;. Living beings that completely detach themselves from SCP-187-DE can no longer be registered. They were described as &#34;exhausted&#34; or &#34;lost&#34;, while growing older, SCP-187-DE spoke of &#34;loss of energy&#34;, &#34;cooling&#34; and finally, obviously cynical, of a &#34;decrease of disorder&#34;. In relation to return to  normal reality SCP-187-DE seems to possess a kind of innate, self-centered protective reflex, which prevents rematerialization within a solid object. However, this does not mean that such an event is impossible. According to its own account, even the idea of such an event causes extreme discomfort and probably would have fatal consequences such as the loss of limbs or even death.

Moreover, even though such items as well as natural barriers in the other reality cannot be moved by objects from the normal reality, they cannot be imbued, too. This means that, for example, worn clothing limits the freedom of movement of SCP-187-DE in such way that it cannot pass through walls or similar objects. According to an unproven assertion, but one articulated with great conviction, this would be easily possible if it was completely naked. This and the fact of an almost impossible containment, should it get rid of its clothing on the other plane, led among other points to the decision to implant the SRA specially made for SCP-187-DE, also because SCP-187-DE quickly proved to be immune to the potentially harmful continuous presence of the implants.

The modified Scranton Reality Anchor (Model Nr.: //HMK-C0122.4 Homecomer//) is an improvement from two previous prototypes whose functionality is based on the model series C of the [http://scp-wiki-de.wikidot.com/ftcm-modell-c9 FTCm]. It is a strongly downsized, portable variant, which has a significantly decreased need for energy than other models because of the rather small field created by it as well as the special biological compound. The visible part of the Homecomer (with a diameter of 6.5 cm and a height of 2.3 cm) is directly implanted in the deltoid of the right upper arm (//musculus deltoideus//). The non-visible part is connected with the biological musculature through artificial muscles and, for stability, with the humerus (//os humeri//). The &#34;Homecomer&#34; possesses two different modes: In the &#34;Fixated&#34;-Mode the Scranton-field is constantly maintained and cannot be ended by SCP-187-DE. This mode can be stopped or initiated from the respective areas. In the &#34;Free&#34;-Mode SCP-187-DE can de- or reactivate the field at will by touching the anchor; the control panel is adjusted to SCP-187-DE&#39;s fingerprints. It is to be noted that the &#34;Fixated&#34;-Mode cannot be forced, as long as SCP-187-DE is not within the normal reality.

The energy supply is provided by a set of nine standard atomic batteries with ^^238^^-Pu, which are embedded in the lower and upper arm musculature (//m. biceps b., m. triceps b., extensor carpi ulnaris//) as well as the upper chest muscle, and produce an effective power of 5.112 W (slightly fluctuating). Corresponding to this absurdly low seeming output strength and range of the created reality field are very small, they are, however, significantly potentiated by a not yet explained interaction with the umbilical cord tissue. Additionally, the field is forced into the shape of the physical body of SCP-187-DE by an equally not sufficiently researched force, ending approximately 1.4 cm outside of it and moving simultaneously to it. All mechanical components of the Homecomer are designed in a way, so that they can adjust to the growth of the bones and tissue.

The idea to use umbilical cord tissue of D-92031 as catalyst for the Scranton field came from Dr. Theodor van Meuten[[footnote]] Former project lead until Incident //MAT-HAZ-1.1//; † 04/15/2014 [[/footnote]]. The underlying consideration was the fact that the unborn child did not change immediately to another plane of reality after the contact with SCP-███-DE, but was apparently held in the normal reality by something else and could therefore survive. The assumption was confirmed after extensive testing and the finding of the increasing effects finally allowed the construction of a series of SRAs up to the current model.

SCP-187-DE additionally possesses an antimemetic property, which cannot be controlled by it and which makes sure, that in the event of a change from the normal reality to the other reality, all memories of it are deleted in the affected personnel. Upon return of the anomaly, all memories are recreated momentarily without information loss. The sudden absence of the concerned memories often leads to confusion in the affected persons, although trained personnel usually detect the occurrence of an antimemetic effect. It is speculated that this property may be a kind of additional cover. It is not sufficiently clarified whether a partial physical blockage in the brain, a forced suppressing psychic effect or another unnatural phenomenon is present.

&gt; **__Incident //MAT-HAZ-1.1//__**
&gt; 
&gt; On 03/07/2014, Dr. T. von Meuten, who was the head of the project at this time, sent a data package concerning SCP-187-DE to unknown persons/organizations. He proceeded in such a clever way that the transfer of the information was not blocked by the automated systems. The recipients are unknown, due to Incident MAT-EDB-1.1 as well as several other events, however, the assumption was corroborated that at least one of the addressees was the group known as &#34;Caecus-Carneliana&#34;. Dr. van Meuten was immediately degraded to D-Class personnel and died eight days later in an experiment with SCP-███-DE, which he himself proposed.

It is composed of stolen archive information from the Foundation and of Dr. van Meuten&#39;s added notes. The purpose of this recollection is to inform responsible personnel of the communicated state of knowledge to the addressees. Regarding the motives of Dr. van Meuten, it is to be noted that he seemed to have developed completely unjustified remorse or discovered misled moral concerns in himself, possibly influenced by his incurable, progressing cancer.

&gt; **So much for the agreed data. I allow myself to add two small excerpts from my personal experience here (they are surveillance transcripts), you can see this as an attempt of proving my honesty towards you. Whether you can interpret these exemplary episodes as confession, must and will not trouble you. First a conversation between the mother and me, shortly after she had talked with the, how you liked to express it, &#34;Genius&#34;.**
&gt; ----
&gt; //[D-92031 is led into the interrogation room by security personnel. Dr. van Meuten shows her to a seat.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-92031:** Please, can you help me? It has touched me and...&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. v. Meuten:** Calm down. You seem to be otherwise quite callous.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **D-92031:** //[dismayed]// &#34;Excuse me?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. v. Meuten:** &#34;Pleaded on self-defense. Twenty-seven stitches. And the house...&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **D-92031:** &#34;He would have killed me and the child! I didn&#39;t know, that someone else...&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. v. Meuten:** &#34;Doesn&#39;t matter, you were convicted by final judgment. You worry about your child? Answer my questions and I am happy to give my word that nothing will happen to the child.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **D-92031:** //[cries]// &#34;Yes.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. v. Meuten:** &#34;You deviated from your provided questionnaire in the conversation you were sent to. And you claim that you can remember the conversation?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **D-92031:** Yes, of course. I was scared to death. How could I forget this?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. v. Meuten:** &#34;How were you addressed? I mean, with which pronoun, what was the voice like, if there was one?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **D-92031:** &#34;It... he sounded soft... the voice hummed and buzzed, calmingly. In my head.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. v. Meuten:** //[makes notes]// &#34;So, a male voice. Report from the point where you stopped asking the preset questions and didn&#39;t write down the answers anymore.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **D-92031:** &#34;He said I should answer in thoughts. He said he knew, what I did. He would grant me a wish. No, actually he asked what I would wish for the most.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. v. Meuten:** &#34;You answered?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **D-92031:** &#34;Freedom. I wanted to be free with the child. But he said that were two wishes. Then the child should be free, I said after that. And then... he touched me, through my belly... Ice-cold was that. He has //laughed// and said...&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. v. Meuten:** &#34;Yes? Go on, please.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **D-92031:** //[shivers]// &#34;He still answered in my head, but somehow also whispering, very close to my ear... He said: &#34;A child needs a father.&#34; Then nothing more.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. v. Meuten:** &#34;Good. That should be enough. Prepare to be questioned again.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **D-92031:** Wait! Your promise, will you... My girl... &#34;
&gt; 
&gt; //[Dr. van Meuten gives the security personnel a signal to remove D-92031]//
&gt; 
&gt; **The next two months the woman must have been immensely worried about her child. I not only did not care, I did not waste a single thought on it. I was completely emotionless and only thought about the child, not because I cared, it was a thing to me, nothing more than another anomaly. Even much later, during the Homecomer project, I remained as cold as a fish. We constructed a room, with which you could send objects into other plane of reality, which devoured immense resources. That way we tested the prototypes. As you know: Animals can be trained to press buttons, timers can be set. But we wanted to know if a human can do it. Rather, whether a person would return in one piece. And prototypes were expensive, more expensive than a life. I knowingly sent many people to death, maybe worse, before I had the idea with the umbilical cord tissue. And I only had it because the pressure from my supervisors increased immensely. I felt no remorse, no guilt. Now, I digress. Look, how the birth proceeded:**
&gt; ----
&gt; //[On 02/16/2004 around 1:20 p.m., D-92031 went into labor for the first time. Almost three hours later, the water broke, the up to this point normally proceeding birth began to take a dramatic course, as the child started to disappear from normal reality in phases for unknown reasons. D-92031 suffered strong blood loss and was quickly transported in an OP equipped with a SRA.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. v. Meuten:** //[from the control room]// &#34;Where is Dr. Bernard, for God&#39;s sake?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; //[Approximately one minute later, Dr. Bernard and two obstetricians arrive.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Bernard:** &#34;What is going on here? The woman already has given birth. You there, treat the bleeding.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. v. Meuten:** &#34;You are wrong. Operator, turn on the Anchor.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; //[With the tarnish of the device the lower abdomen bulges completely again. D-92031 cries.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Bernard:** &#34;My god. Control, what do I give birth to here?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. v. Meuten:** &#34;Do not worry, it is clearly human. Initiate the cesarean section.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Bernard:** &#34;That won&#39;t be necessary. As I see it, the child can be born the normal way.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. v. Meuten:** &#34;Begin with the cesarean section, Doctor. That is an official order.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; //[The surgery proceeds without further complications. D-92031 intermediately loses consciousness.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Bernard:** //[baby cry]// &#34;Cutting umbilical cord. Clamp. Control, we have a healthy girl here. I take care of the mother. You, prepare her for the closing.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. v. Meuten:** &#34;The child has priority. Start the standard tests.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Bernard:** &#34;I must not be hearing right, the child reacts completely normal, the mother...&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. v. Meuten:** &#34;Follow the order, for fuck&#39;s sake.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; //[D-92031 died on 02/16/2004 around 6:27 p.m.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **The mother probably would have survived, if I had given different orders. You understand why I always talk about guilt and am ashamed to death. The girl is now ten years old. I saw her growing up and assure you, she is a bright, lovely child. She received a big present prior to her birth, and we took it away from her. So I ask you again: Save the girl, give her back her freedom. Help Mathilda.**

&gt; **__Incident/Containment Breach //MAT-EDB-1.1//__**
&gt; 
&gt; __Foreword:__ The events mentioned below took place on 07/21/2015. The behavior of SCP-███-DE indicates that the containment procedures assigned for it did not fulfill their purpose in any way, but that the entity remained in containment willingly up to this point. The mode change of the Homecomer, however, turned out to be a last, long-planned prank from Dr. v. Meuten, a hidden manipulation of the protocols. The time seemed to be coordinated with the invading group and SCP-███-DE, while the motives of the latter still remain unclear.
&gt; 
&gt; **0:31**: All esoteric containment procedures in the containment unit of SCP-███-DE are deleted or destroyed. Mild destruction of the camera feed. At the same time, a non-authorized, automated change of the personal SRAs of SCP-187-DE in the &#34;Free&#34;-Mode takes place.
&gt; 
&gt; **0:32**: Notification and deployment of appropriate personnel.
&gt; 
&gt; **0:35**: Appearance of two hooded, fully armed intruders in the living unit of SCP-187-DE. Upon their appearance they are hold in the middle of the room by huge, semi-transparent fingers. The limbs appear very unkempt, with broken nails as well as hangnails up to the height of the first joint. Mild disruption of the camera feed until the disappearance of the figure after approximately seven seconds.
&gt; 
&gt; **0:36**: The two persons harass SCP-187-DE, it instinctively reacts with the shutdown of the Homecomer. The intruders seem disoriented and start to barricade the security door.
&gt; 
&gt; **0:39**: Reappearance of SCP-187-DE and an oversized, semi-transparent hand, which starts to inflict extreme physical harm on the intruders. An almost immediate death follows, whereupon the hand demanifests.
&gt; 
&gt; **0:41**: Security personnel reaches the containment unit of SCP-187-DE.
&gt; 
&gt; **6:00**: Start of the questioning of SCP-187-DE. It stands under extreme shock and cannot remember the time outside of the normal reality.
&gt; 
&gt; **15:00**: Amnestic administration for SCP-187-DE is initiated; the status of SCP-███-DE is changed to &#34;uncontained&#34;.
&gt; ----
[[/collapsible]]
@@ @@
**Psychological evaluation of SCP-187-DE on 06/01/2016:** The recently criticized behavior of SCP-187-DE has a cause, which is easy to understand as well as natural and which is unlikely to have escaped the attention of those responsible: SCP-187-DE enters puberty. Defiance, moody behavior and doubting of the given tasks is completely normal. It is to be kept in mind that SCP-187-DE also never had the possibility to have a &#34;phase of defiance&#34; in early childhood. We strongly recommend to create an environment for the anomaly, in which it can get to know friends and persons with a role model function, ideally, if a little late, a mother and/or father figure. Of course, these persons will need to be loyal Foundation workers. They also should not be too old. The decision over that and how it can be done during the planned agent training of SCP-187-DE is up to the O4 Council[[footnote]] The highest ranking members of the German Foundation. They report directly to the O5 Council. [[/footnote]].
