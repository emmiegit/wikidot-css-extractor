**PEDESTRIAN 1:** I...what? That’s ridiculous!

**PEDESTRIAN 2:** Oh come on man, don’t be disgusting.

**PEDESTRIAN 3:** Holovision is really running out of ideas, huh?

**PEDESTRIAN 4:** Oh, wow, ew, gross, I’m shocked. ...Are y’all gonna pay me for this?

//Audience laughs. Camera pans to MIKE CATMAN, SHOW HOST.//

**MIKE CATMAN:** Those were just a few of the reactions we got on the street when we showed people the subject of today’s episode of CATMAN’S CRITTERS.

//CATMAN’S CRITTERS theme song plays. [CATMAN’S CRITTERS and CATMAN’S CRITTERS JINGLE are registered trademarks of HELIX HOLOVISION LLC.]//

**MIKE CATMAN:** Coming up after the break, we have a leading expert on today’s ‘Critter’ and author of the upcoming book //FROM FLAGELLATES TO FOLLICLE FLAPS: THE FASCINATING FOUNDATIONS OF FLUID FEEDERS//, Doctor Jacob Jacobs!

//Camera pans out as audience cheers. Five minutes of advertisements play.//

**MIKE CATMAN:** And we’re back to more CATMAN’S CRITTERS!

//Audience cheers.//

**MIKE CATMAN:** With us today is a very special guest. Doctor Jacob Jacobs is a biologist who specializes in alien anatomy and evolution. Is Jake OK, Doctor?

**JACOB JACOBS:** Jake is just fine, Mike. I’m happy to be on the show!

**MIKE CATMAN:** We’re happy to have you with us. Jake, why don’t you introduce us to today’s ‘Critter’?

**JAKE JACOBS:** Sure. Today’s ‘Critter’ is brand new to science, only recently discovered thanks to radio transmissions. We’ve taken to calling them “Synapsids”, after their similarities to our own synapsids, as you’ll see are abundant.

//MIKE signals to an offscreen producer, and a still photograph of a SYNAPSID is projected on the screen behind the stage. The audience collectively gasps.//

**MIKE CATMAN:** Wow, that is… I’ve seen it before, but you never really get used to this thing, do you?

**JAKE JACOBS:** I haven’t yet, Mike, and not for lack of trying.

**MIKE CATMAN:** //Ahem.// Anyway. Why don’t you tell us exactly what we’re looking at here. “Synapsid”, right?

**JAKE JACOBS:** That’s right, Mike. As you can see, it has all of the basic synapsid features: Thorax, torso, contiguous head region, and four extending limbs. There’s even fur on some of the specimens.

**MIKE CATMAN:** Hold on, you said...four limbs? If I remember my schooling, I thought synapsids have five?

**JAKE JACOBS:** You’re close, but that’s not exactly accurate. Synapsids indeed have five protrusions, but only four are fully articulated. The one extending from the hindquarters is an extension of its internal skeleton, a kind of “tail end”, if you will.

**MIKE CATMAN:** And this one doesn’t have a “tail”. Do the others?

**JAKE JACOBS:** None of the synapsid specimens appear to have tails, no.

**MIKE CATMAN:** Nature is truly fascinating. Now Jake, can you tell us anything else about these, uh, synapsids? How big are they, what do they eat, that kind of thing.

**JAKE JACOBS:** Sure. As far as size goes, they appear to be about twenty mandibles tall on average, but there’s significant variation. The transmissions have actually been very helpful in that regard; they seem to make extensive use of tools, which can be used to gauge relative size.

**MIKE CATMAN:** Tools. Do you think the broadcasts are from the synapsids themselves?

**JAKE JACOBS:** It’s the leading theory right now, Mike. I don’t know why else the footage would almost exclusively be of them.

**MIKE CATMAN:** Right. Of course.

//MIKE pauses for several seconds, seemingly in contemplation. The focus shifts to a section of the audience, members of which are murmuring amongst themselves, then back to the stage.//

**MIKE CATMAN:** You know what, I’m sorry, I… I just can’t get past it. I gotta ask… What’s with the uh, thing down there? Between the limbs?

**JAKE JACOBS:** //Laughs// It’s quite alright, Mike. It was my first question too. I hope this is alright to say on HV, but we think that’s the...uh… reproductive center.

**MIKE CATMAN:** You mean the balls?

//Audience laughs.//

**JAKE JACOBS:** That’s right. The balls are on the outside.

**MIKE CATMAN:** I… what purpose could that possibly serve? Wouldn&#39;t that be dangerous? How could that survive natural selection?

**JAKE JACOBS:** Beats me, Mike. And that’s my professional opinion: I’m as stumped as you are.

**MIKE CATMAN:** Truly disturbing. //Pauses.// I think our time&#39;s about up, unfortunately. Doctor Jacobs, a pleasure as always.

**JAKE JACOBS:** The pleasure&#39;s all mine, Mike. //Snaps mandibles//

//MIKE snaps his mandibles. The camera pans out above the stage, and the audience enters the picture.//

**MIKE CATMAN:** (Get that thing off the screen.) 

//The image of a SYNAPSID disappears from the screen, replaced by the HELIX HOLOVISION logo.//

**MIKE CATMAN:** CATMAN&#39;S CRITTERS will be back right after the break, where we&#39;ve got some more... Synapsid... footage. Great.

//Audience members politely snap mandibles. Picture cuts to commercials.//</textarea></pre>
