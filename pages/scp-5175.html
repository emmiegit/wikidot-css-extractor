**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5175 is to be contained in anomalous item locker 5175, located at Area-179.

Due to the symbiotic relationship between SCP-5175 and PoI-3445, as well as the beneficial nature of the anomaly, PoI-3445 has been integrated into the Foundation&#39;s internal command structure. Mobile Task Force Ω-5 &#34;Damien&#39;s Angels&#34; has been created to assist PoI-3445 in their missions, under the auspices of Project SECRET-SHOPPER.

Upon authorization by Mobile Task Force Lieutenant Samuel Deangelo, PoI-3445 is to retrieve SCP-5175 for the purposes of carrying out missions assigned to them.

**Description:** SCP-5175 is an ornate knife of Moroccan design and unknown origin. SCP-5175 displays no anomalous abilities when handled by an individual who is not symbiotically bound to the object. The criteria by which SCP-5175 becomes bound to a user is apparently under the discretion and personal favor of SCP-5175-1. Presently, PoI-3445 is the only individual capable of handling SCP-5175 in a way that manifests its anomalous properties.

When handled by its host, SCP-5175 is capable of removing any form of life from baseline reality upon laceration. This effect has proven to be applicable to incorporeal beings who would otherwise have no physical presence. Upon piercing a target, a black mist will begin to emanate from the object. This mist will envelop the target, causing them to disappear. According to unverifiable information provided by SCP-5175-1 and PoI-3445, victims of SCP-5175 are transported to an unknown extradimensional space that has been colloquially referred to as &#34;The Realm of Unsaved Souls&#34;, &#34;Land of the Forsaken Suffering&#34;, and &#34;//Kanashī Ringo no Akuma no Ryōiki//&#34;[[footnote]]Roughly translates to &#39;demon realm for bad apples&#39;[[/footnote]].

SCP-5175-1 is a being that claims to be the consciousness of Kuroitanken Hanzo, a Japanese samurai who, according to the entity, was born in 1800, and served as a supporter of the Imperial Court in the Boshin War.[[footnote]] Sometimes referred to as the Japanese Civil War. The conflict lasted from 1868 to 1869, and was fought between the Tokugawa Shogunate and those who intended to restore power to the Imperial Court.[[/footnote]] When SCP-5175 is handled by its host, SCP-5175-1 will manifest itself as an animate ethereal figure that hovers above or near the subject. SCP-5175-1&#39;s physical appearance is that of a human skeleton wearing a suit of black and purple //dō-maru// armor. SCP-5175-1&#39;s silhouette constantly emanates black mist, similar to the vapor produced by the object itself. SCP-5175-1 is capable of communicating with its host, regardless of apparent language barriers. Likewise, a host is capable of comprehension of SCP-5175-1&#39;s speech, despite being spoken in 19th century Japanese. SCP-5175-1 is capable of interacting with physical objects.

PoI-3445 is Damien Lawrence Woodcock, a resident of Scranton, Pennsylvania. PoI-3445 was a security officer who had been employed for 8 years at [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-458 The Marketplace at Steamtown][[footnote]] A shopping mall in Scranton[[/footnote]]. PoI-3445 exhibits no anomalous characteristics, but is considered integral to the containment and handling of SCP-5175 due to being the only individual SCP-5175-1 agrees to work with.

PoI-3445 has been integrated as a Foundation employee as a part of Project SECRET-SHOPPER, and currently operates as a specialized Foundation agent. See addenda for further detail.

[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5175/cutlery.jpg|align=right|width=30%|caption=Cutlery Collection, the discovery site of SCP-5175]]

According to PoI-3445&#39;s personal accounts, SCP-5175 was discovered on 2009/8/03, at &#39;Cutlery Collection&#39;, a storefront located at The Marketplace that specializes in the sale of edged weapons. PoI-3445 reported hearing the voice of SCP-5175-1, urging him to enter the store and purchase the object.

Over a period of two months, PoI-3445 became familiar with handling SCP-5175 through the construction of a &#39;training ground&#39; in the woods behind his parents&#39; residence. As such, PoI-3445 has attained cursory skill in knife combat. It is during this time period in which PoI-3445 and SCP-5175-1 developed their relationship.

On 2009/10/27, PoI-3445 attempted to use SCP-5175 in an altercation with a shoplifter, resulting in the appearance of SCP-5175-1. While the event occurred in public, the low traffic of the shopping center resulted in only a handful of witnesses. Amnestics were administered as appropriate, and PoI-3445 was detained by local law enforcement before being brought into Foundation custody.

= **&gt;&gt;BEGIN LOG&lt;&lt;**

**Dr. Trenton:** You look a little tense, Mr. Woodcock. There&#39;s a cooler out back if you need a water or something. I understand this is... a lot to take in at once.

**PoI-3445:** (//Distressed//) This is some Men In Black shit. Please, all I&#39;m asking is for an easy hearing. I can&#39;t do mind games, I can&#39;t do another interrogation.

**Dr. Trenton:** Mind if I call you Damien? Damien, we&#39;re not here to arrest you. That already happened. And you&#39;re clean, at least with the law. We just want to ask you some questions.

**PoI-3445:** Did you call my parents?

**Dr. Trenton:** I  — //erm//, no, we didn&#39;t call your parents.

//PoI-3445 sighs and rubs his hands over his face.//

**PoI-3445:** Thank god. Okay, okay. I guess you wanna know about DEATH KNIFE, right? I&#39;m assuming the ghost knife is why the Men in Black would kidnap me. You want the Kai version or the Z version?

**Dr. Trenton:** What?

**PoI-3445:** Short or long. It&#39;s a reference, god.

**Dr. Trenton:** Yeah, references aren&#39;t my strong suit. From the beginning, please. Take as much time as you need.

**PoI-3445:** Alright, so, I&#39;m a mall security guard. Have been for the past 8 years. I&#39;ve always had an interest in, like, weapons and stuff. I have my uncle&#39;s katana hanging over my bed, and I do pretty cool knife tricks sometimes. Watch this —

//PoI-3445 brandishes an ordinary kitchen knife from his sweater pocket, and stabs it into the table.//

**Dr. Trenton:** (//Distressed//) Where the hell did you get that? I thought they frisked you.

**PoI-3445:** Backup knife. I always keep it on me. I can make it balance on any surface.

//PoI-3445 removes his hand from the knife, it stands upright.//

**Dr. Trenton:** Can — Can you just continue the story?

**PoI-3445:** Anyways, yeah. I like weapons and stuff. There&#39;s this really cool store at the mall called Cutlery Collection. I make sure to check every shipment they get in if they have anything I want. I was doing that, and I saw this sick Japanese knife. I heard this voice in my head telling me I had the resolve of a warrior, and that I had to buy it. I freaked out really bad, but it was so badass. Like something out of the first chapter of a manga. That&#39;s Japanese for —

**Dr. Trenton:** I&#39;m aware, Damien.

**PoI-3445:** Oh, what have you read?

**Dr. Trenton:** No, I — please continue.

**PoI-3445:** Alright, so I bought it. When I got home, the voice told me to grip the knife in a certain way. Like //this//.

//PoI-3445 picks up the knife from the table and gestures using it.//

**PoI-3445:** And then this fuckin&#39; metal skeleton guy wearing //Shinobi// armor came out. If you&#39;ve ever seen JoJo, he&#39;s kind of like a stand. He told me his name was Hanzo, and he was an ancient samurai ghost. He said he chose me as a host because of my insatiable blood lust, knowledge of his culture, military background, and years of combat experience. It was so goddamn cool.

**Dr. Trenton:** Your service record says that you went AWOL one month into basic training.

**PoI-3445:** You can learn a lot in a month.

**Dr. Trenton:** Years of combat experience?

**PoI-3445:** Well, I eventually figured out he was talking about how good I am at certain video games. Like, you ever hear of Assassins Creed? I learned a lot of street tactics from that. I&#39;ve also done legendary on Halo 3 four times. I showed him my skills for a week straight, just playing games and watching anime together. He thought it was magic, and that I was fighting in other worlds, or something. I kind of just let him think that, because it was kinda badass.

**Dr. Trenton:** Can you elaborate more on this entity?

**PoI-3445:** Hanzo&#39;s, like, 800 years old or something. After he was confident enough that I was a suitable host, he told me his tragic backstory. A witch-woman from a foreign land came to Japan a long time ago, and started blowing shit up with her magic! So Hanzo and a bunch of his ninja students had to fight her, but she killed them all. Hanzo felt so guilty that he begged her to kill him on the spot. Instead, she sealed his soul to her cursed blade, and locked it away in a chest. Things move over the years, blah, blah, blah, and eventually DEATH KNIFE ends up in the mall I work at!

**Dr. Trenton:** I&#39;m assuming DEATH KNIFE is the name of the blade.

**PoI-3445:** I came up with it myself! It&#39;s spelled in all caps, so put that on your clipboard. I call it that because the blade completely kills anything it touches completely!

**Dr. Trenton:** And let me clarify, you haven&#39;t used... the object prior to today&#39;s incident, right?

**PoI-3445:** Hanzo told me what it would do, but no, I never used it before today. He said that whoever is pierced by the blade is sent to the Land of the Forsaken Suffering, like the Shadow Realm from Yu-Gi-Oh! It&#39;s a forsaken dimension of shadows and suffering! If his blade doesn&#39;t relinquish 1,000,000 lives to the Realm of Unsaved Souls, he&#39;ll never be free from his metal prison. He needed my help to do that, and to reclaim his honor by teaching a student once again.

**Dr. Trenton:** And how did you feel about this?

**PoI-3445:** I thought it was a badass backstory and all but it was way too much for me. 1,000,000 souls is a lot of souls, and I genuinely don&#39;t have time to do all that. I tried to tell him I could, like, teach him to be good at Space Hulk instead, but he was insistent on training me. I think it was to make up for the students he failed hundreds of years ago.

**Dr. Trenton:** And you accepted the entity&#39;s training?

**PoI-3445:** Can we talk about this more tomorrow? I&#39;m really tired.

**Dr. Trenton:** Uh, sure, Damien. My team&#39;s going to run some tests on the object anyways. We&#39;ll pick up where we left off in the morning.

**PoI-3445:** Can I have my phone back?

//Dr. Trenton puts his hand up to his ear, pressing his communication device.//

**Dr. Trenton:** I&#39;m afraid not. And, we&#39;re done. You can put away the Class-Bs, we won&#39;t need them.

**PoI-3445:** I have to get a daily log-in bonus. Can I have it back for just for a second?

//Dr. Trenton gets up from his seat.//

**Dr. Trenton:** We&#39;re done for the night. Hand over the backup knife on the way out.

**Researcher&#39;s Note:** //Subject demonstrated an almost unheard of level of acceptance and confidence despite being an ordinary citizen in an anomalous situation. I&#39;m not sure whether to attribute it to stupidity or legitimate fortitude. Still, there&#39;s a slight issue. Considering PoI-3445 was in possession of SCP-5175 for a period of over two months, as well as corresponding with SCP-5175-1 during that time, regular amnestics aren&#39;t going to work here. Subject is currently being detained in Cell C007 until a specialized amnestic treatment can be agreed upon. Interviews continue tomorrow. Perhaps consideration for a D-Class position? - Dr. Trenton//

//Dr. Trenton enters the room where PoI-3445 had been waiting and takes a seat.//

**PoI-3445:** //Ohayou//, Trenton-san.

**Dr. Trenton:** (//Pauses//) Uh, morning, Damien.

**PoI-3445:** That bed sucked.

**Dr. Trenton:** I’m very sorry about that. We ran some tests on the object last —

**PoI-3445:** On DEATH KNIFE?

**Dr. Trenton:** Yeah, on… the knife. For whatever reason, we’re unable to trigger its anomalous properties. It’s just an ordinary blade.

**PoI-3445:** Well //duh//, you can’t do anything with it. Hanzo only comes out when I use it. //That’s// why I’m the host. (//Laughs//) I thought you guys were supposed to be smart!

**Dr. Trenton:** We figured that out. I was just informing you that, depending on approval from the research head, you might have to undergo testing.

**PoI-3445:** Like, dangerous testing? Don’t I have to sign something for that?

**Dr. Trenton:** (//Laughs//) Not here. It won’t be anything too bad. Using the object on animal subjects, allowing us to speak with the entity. Don’t worry about it for now. Want to pick up from last night?

**PoI-3445:** Oh, right. I was talking about how Hanzo wanted to train me. I tried distracting him with more games, because technically I //was// training competitively, but he started getting super serious. Hanzo only activates when I wield DEATH KNIFE, so I threw it in the back of my closet and left it there for a week.

**Dr. Trenton:** Was this out of fear or apathy?

**PoI-3445:** I just didn’t have time to train! It was cool he chose me and all but I already have — I mean, I know how to use a weapon. If the situation called for it, I could disarm a man.

//Trenton coughs, clearly holding back laughter.//

**Dr. Trenton:** Excuse me. (//Pause//) What drew you back to the object?

**PoI-3445:** I was leaving work one day, and I — wait, I haven’t told you about Emily yet. She works at Auntie Anne&#39;s, the pretzel place. She’s this really hot goth girl — more Lydia Deetz than one of those pathetic Ramona Flowers pastel scene kids. Like, she listens to The Cure instead of some shitty pop punk garbage like post-American Idiot Green Day. You know what I mean?

**Dr. Trenton:** No.

**PoI-3445:** Alright, well I’ve been trying to talk to her for years now. That’s besides the point. I was leaving work, and I saw some dude breaking into Emily’s car. I went for DEATH KNIFE, but I was like, shit, it’s at home. It didn’t matter though, because I immediately rushed him and started beating the shit out of him. Like, when I get mad — I lose all composure and see red, man. I see //red//.

**Dr. Trenton:** You stopped car theft?

**PoI-3445:** I didn’t actually stop him. Like, he took some stuff, but I went crazy for a second. He lost 3 teeth, and there was blood everywhere. Emily was so thankful. After that, I realized I need to start training. I had this awesome gift in my hands and I was letting it go to waste.

**Dr. Trenton:** Let me stop you. You learned how to handle the knife… because you successfully stopped a robbery?

**PoI-3445:** I beat the guy up. I realized I could reach my full potential if I became Hanzo’s student.

**Dr. Trenton:** Are you sure that’s what happened? This is a judgement-free zone, Damien.

**PoI-3445:** Yeah.

//Silence.//

**Dr. Trenton:** Carry on.

**PoI-3445:** There&#39;s a lot of bad people in this world, and I realized I could do some good with this thing.  I apologized to Hanzo for leaving him in my closet, and he took it pretty well. As punishment, he said he was going to be relentless in my training, but he was glad I agreed. At first we were in the woods behind my house, but I got my dad to help build specialized training devices. Soon I had the whole place loaded with traps, test dummies, and targets.

**Dr. Trenton:** Your parents, do they know about the entity?

**PoI-3445:** Obviously //not//. What’s the point in having a secret ability if it’s not a //secret//? I told you, I’m going for the full experience here.

**Dr. Trenton:** Right, I forgot.

**PoI-3445:** Over the next couple weeks, Hanzo put me through the wringer. He’s a bit of an asshole, and I disagree with a lot of his teaching methods, but he’s improved my ability to fight tenfold, which is impressive considering my natural aggression. I was decent before with a knife, but now I can do some serious damage. If you give me the other knife back I can sh —

**Dr. Trenton:** No can do. What type of training did you perform with Hanzo?

**PoI-3445:** How to throw, basic fighting stances, doing backflips by having him lift me up. I’m pretty much combat ready at this point. You know what happens next. I catch a shoplifter, Hanzo does his thing, and then I&#39;m arrested.

**Dr. Trenton:** What was going through your head there? What was the best possible way that scenario could’ve played out?

**PoI-3445:** I was trying to impress Emily. I made sure to get him right in front of Auntie Anne&#39;s. Then I remembered it was Tuesday, and she was off. I don&#39;t know, I just really wanted to do something good for once. I&#39;ve been working there for 8 years. There&#39;s a whole mall out there to protect, and I&#39;ve never done that once.

**Dr. Trenton:** Interesting. Well, my request to reintroduce the object to you should be approved by tomorrow. Would you believe me if I said this wasn’t my first time interviewing an 200-year-old samurai?

**PoI-3445:** Seriously?

**Dr. Trenton:** (//Laughs//) No, but I&#39;m looking forward to it. Thank you for your time, Damien.

**Dr. Trenton:** Sorry about the delay, Damien. Been busy the past week. The tests earlier went well. Let&#39;s get the interview underway, hm?

**PoI-3445:** //Fukōda to omowanaide//[[footnote]]Loosely translates to &#39;do not think unhappy&#39;[[/footnote]].

**Dr. Trenton:** Yep. I&#39;m going to hand you the object. You&#39;re able to act as a translator?

**PoI-3445:** Of course. Our bond is like steel folded a thousand times, doctor.

//Dr. Trenton hands SCP-5175 to PoI-3445. Subject&#39;s pupils dilate. SCP-5175-1 appears, hovering behind PoI-3445. The entity begins speaking in its local dialect as PoI-3445 translates. Extraneous dialogue detailing the translation process has been removed.//

**Dr. Trenton:** Mr. Kuroitanken?

**SCP-5175-1:** &#39;I understand I have been awoken for the purpose of questioning. Again, I thank you for returning me to my host.&#39;[[footnote]]Translated by PoI-3445 following the interview[[/footnote]]

**Dr. Trenton:** Of course. I only have a few questions. Can you verify the account Damien gave about your soul being bound to the object?

**SCP-5175-1:** &#39;Yes. Yes, I can. While most men I fought against in the war were [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4449 of my own nation], the shogunate would make use of mercenaries from far away lands, some of whom possessed unnatural abilities. An accursed girl who has apparently been lost to the ages sealed me away hundreds of years ago. Pay her no mind. I do not wish to speak of her, but know this. It is because of her curse that I am bound to the fulfillment of the Land of Forsaken Suffering. If I do not relinquish 1,000,000 lives to the Realm of Unsaved Souls, I can never leave my prison. This is why I must fight. This is why I require my host.&#39;

**Dr. Trenton:** And has Damien used the object in this way? How many souls has he claimed?

**SCP-5175-1:** &#39;One raccoon. I told him it was needlessly cruel but Damien was insistent on seeing how it worked.&#39;

**PoI-3445:** I didn&#39;t believe you! I said I was sorry!

**Dr. Trenton:** Why Damien? Why choose him over everyone else? Especially to the point where you refuse to cooperate with anyone else. Surely there are more capable fighters?

**PoI-3445:** What does that mean? I fight perfectly fine!

**SCP-5175-1:** &#39;I sensed Damien&#39;s thirst for blood the moment I inhabited the marketplace. His strong moral code, his experience with sorcery. I felt it all, and I called to him. He is the vessel I require to navigate these uncertain waters.&#39;

**PoI-3445:** Told you.

**SCP-5175-1:** &#39;For awhile, I thought I had made a mistake. I may be blind in this new world, but I am not a fool. While your knowledge of the arts and cultures of my homeland and mastery in the commonplace magics impressed me, I slowly realized that your simulated games are exactly that - games. What I interpreted as the heart of a warrior was instead a sheet of sorcery pulled over my head. I sensed something else, the desire to contribute something of worth to someone else&#39;s life. Death alone make not a samurai. This is why I stayed with you.&#39;

**PoI-3445:** I mean, the games kind of helped me. And you even enjoyed them! You liked all the shows we watched too.

**SCP-5175-1:** &#39;That I did. Your conjuring of moving drawings that act as if they were players on a stage has provided me with great insight and enjoyment.&#39;

**Dr. Trenton:** I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re talking about cartoons.

//SCP-5175-1 brandishes a sword and points it at Dr. Trenton. Trenton jumps back in shock.//

**Dr. Trenton:** Whoa—!

**SCP-5175-1:** &#39;Damien insists you refer to them as their proper name — anime.&#39;

**Dr. Trenton:** Anime. My apologies, Mr. Kuroitanken. (//Clears throat//) That still doesn&#39;t answer my question.

**SCP-5175-1:** &#39;Because I have not reached that point yet. Damien&#39;s fighting spirit came from his resilience and fortitude during training. It was his drive to overcome his desires to constantly lounge and engage in games all day that has earned him respect. What I interpreted as fighting experience from his simulated magic was instead a deep-rooted drive to acclimate to a new environment. While Damien may not be a capable fighter by any means, he is an exceptional student, and has the heart required to succeed as one.&#39;

//Silence.//

**PoI-3445:** (//Pause//) Wow, thank you. That&#39;s probably the best compliment anyone&#39;s ever given me.

**SCP-5175-1:** &#39;You have proven yourself, above all else, to be a worthy and honorable host, Damien Woodcock. I am glad to have chosen you.&#39;

**Project Overview:** SECRET-SHOPPER is an attempt to expand the research potential of SCP-5175. As operating on human subjects is inhumane and resource-intensive, an alternative is proposed involving SCP-████. The primary benefits of this project are the solution to a longstanding annoyance for our personnel, as well as an opportunity to test SCP-5175 in an effective way.

Of course, considering the nature of SCP-5175-1, this would require employing PoI-3445 as a specialized Foundation operative. I&#39;ve already worked out the paperwork with recruitment. PoI-3445 will [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6599 not] be assigned any tasks outside of their weekly operations under Project SECRET-SHOPPER, which exists solely to combat the excess of SCP-████-A. Lieutenant Samuel Deangelo and a proposed small-scale task force under the name Ω-5 &#34;Damien&#39;s Angels&#34; has agreed to oversee PoI-3445 and their assignments. Overall, this would be an extremely limited and controlled environment.

I&#39;ve attached a summarized file regarding SCP-████ below. I believe my reasoning will become evident.

**Item #:** SCP-████

**Special Containment Procedures:** All entrances to SCP-████ have been sealed. Research is currently underway to determine a method of SCP-████-A extermination.

**Description:** SCP-████ is a building known as the Prism Center, a former shopping mall located in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. SCP-████ demonstrates zero anomalous properties beyond its ability to create SCP-████-A. Approximately 15 SCP-████-A instances are generated inside SCP-████ daily.

SCP-████-A are hostile, ethereal figures resembling horned humanoid silhouettes, officially classified as Type-Yodh Faustian-Class Tartarian entities. SCP-████-A possess an anomalous resistance to nearly all types of weaponry typically used in the extermination of similar entities. There are no other discernible anomalous properties of SCP-████-A, providing little incentive for further research.

There is no current method of containment for these entities. Usual Faustian containment methods such as occult weaponry, thaumaturgy, and theological invocation have failed. Presently, SCP-████ contains 27,375 SCP-████-A instances.

------
**Afterword:** //Despite SCP-5175&#39;s short testing window, I have reason to believe the object will be the solution to our problems regarding the rapid and unending creation of SCP-████-A. There have been multiple incidents over the past three years involving attempted trespass into SCP-████.//

//SCP-████ has long been regarded as a location of low priority, but I disagree. Having this many entities with limited research potential endlessly spawning in one location is a ticking Veil bomb waiting to explode. The sooner we&#39;re able to clean out the place, the better.//

//Please consider Project SECRET-SHOPPER for approval.//

**PoI-3445:** Halt. I&#39;m familiar with this terrain.
