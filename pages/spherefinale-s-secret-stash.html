= [[size 200%]] **Welcome to SphereFinale&#39;s Author Page!** [[/size]] 

@@ @@

Why, hello there dear reader/explorer/stalker. I go by the name of **SphereFinale**. Long time reader, newer writer. Glad to see you here.
 
My works tend to spawn out of ideas that just pop up in my head. Therefore the overall topics and themes vary, but I usually like to mix feelings of mystery in there. 

Make yourself comfortable, my works are right here ready for your eyes. If you want you can also ponder with me questions like where can I get refunds for life or when can I stop checking the Urban Dictionary when I&#39;m talking to people 10 years younger than myself.

If you&#39;re a member of some of the SCP themed Discord servers you might have spotted me. I do critting here and there, especially when trading drafts.

[[tab Season 1]]

[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6242 SCP-6242] **- Eco-Friendly Infection**

&gt; //&#34;The subject asphyxiated D-2151 through strangulation, resulting in his death. Reason for conflict being a disagreement over the morality of consuming dairy products.&#34;//

My first SCP that started out as a sudden desire to get writing an SCP article off my bucket list. As you can see, that wasn&#39;t the end of it.
I wanted to start by writing something related to my forestry studies. While not up to my current standards, it holds a place in my heart.

------

[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6650 SCP-6650] **- The Starling Soars Once More**

&gt; //&#34;They needed to have their eyes opened to receive what my messenger brings them, just like Nicholas.&#34;//

Currently my longest piece to date, and my first real attempt at a bit more complex story telling.
Interestingly it got more complex as I got more feedback and touch into scp writing, so writing it was quite the adventure.

------

[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6497 SCP-6497] **- Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained**

&gt; //&#34;Either way, we now have a lot of fleshy spare parts to hunt down. It&#39;s just hard to imagine a reasonable motive for any of this, and finally getting to hear that voice myself makes this feel that much more personal to me.&#34;//

During my wild reading spree I found a couple scips from the older series which together inspired this one. A classic case of SphereFinale writing where the big picture grows bigger than initially intended.

------

[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-spdr-j SCP-SPDR-J] **- Arachnophobic Colleague**

&gt; //&#34;This ability is almost exclusively used in a situation where Researcher Jenner spots SCP-SPDR-J, and exits the room to either seek help or a tool to neutralize it with. Upon returning to the room, SCP-SPDR-J will have disappeared, much to the horror of Researcher Jenner&#34;//

Random funny idea. First attempt on a -J. Spider warning for those who relate to Researcher Jenner.

------

[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6906 SCP-6906] **- I&#39;d Rather Not...**

&gt; //&#34;I&#39;m tired.&#34;//

Continuing the series of &#34;Sphere tries new stuff&#34;, after struggling to write short scips I finally got an idea which I believed would do better if left short. Loosely inspired by my emotional struggles in my late teens and murder monsters from a certain animation web series. 
Note from future Sphere: still one of my favs.

[[tab Season 2]]

[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6185 SCP-6185] **- By My Hand**

&gt; //&#34;SCP-6185-B is a pair of disembodied, mobile hands belonging to late Penny Cooper. SCP-6185-B instances are both capable of locomotion using their fingers, and operate as a single unit by assisting each other in traversing and interacting with their environment.&#34;//

I visited a base idea I got from an MMORPG game, which resulted in... whatever this is haha. Crawling hands... have I read another scp that has those? //*Jack Waltz stares at me from the walls.*//
My shortest scp to date so I was happy to have gotten better in keeping it short.

------

[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7714 SCP-7714] **- Fortunate Souls**

&gt; //&#34;SCP-7714-A is believed to have existed for thousands of years prior to human activity existing within it. It is currently unknown how civilization existed within the body of SCP-7714-A, as well as its cause of death.&#34;//

7k entry written by me as well as [[*user TheDarkArtist]] and [[*user AvocadoMilk]]. The base idea itself began almost a year before the contest when we were all very much beginners, but that year fortunately gave us everything we needed to bring this idea back for the contest.
We were all happy with how it turned out, and managed to get ourselves a place in the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/war-on-all-fronts-hub War On All Fronts]- canon as well. 

------

[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7474 SCP-7474] **- A Blatant(?) Rip-Off**

&gt; //&#34;Crowd control efforts have been limited towards ensuring the integrity of Foundation operations near human settlements. Furthermore, knowledge pertaining to the false origin of recent SCP-7474 manifestations is to be upheld by any means necessary.&#34;//

I can&#39;t explain how I got this idea. A short piece of weirdcore about rip-off items.

------

[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7950 SCP-7950] **- Get Over It**

&gt; //&#34;SCP-7950 is a humanoid spectral entity resembling a peasant typical to the Victorian Era. It is currently located in a field in Cranleigh, England where all its activity has taken place.&#34;//

7950 is definitely one of my personal favs out of my works. Apparently morning air and misty fields give good ideas. I am honored it was featured in SCP Wiki Reading Club, where the hosts made good conversation of it. Link to the podcast [https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/scp-wiki-archives/episodes/EU-Reading-Club--March-18--2023-e20of0m here] to anyone interested.

------

[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-flesh-that-raves The Flesh That Raves]

&gt; //&#34;The moist smell of rot almost makes me retch, but those horrific bodies of twisted bones and crusted layers of scarring moving so fluidly in rhythm is enticing.&#34;//

A funny short tale featuring a 610 outbreak survivor who discovers something that changes his life forever. Bust out those moves for April Fools!
