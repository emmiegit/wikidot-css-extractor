**Input:** One administrative map of Novosibirsk Oblast //(Russian: Новосиби́рская о́бласть)//, 1:100000 size.
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** No change in initial appearance. However, once swiped by a hand, the location would shift with respect to the motion of the hand. All //de facto// administrative divisions, correct as of the present, up to the fourth-tier, as well as rivers, can be seen on the map. However, the map ratio is always strictly 1:100000 regardless of position. No anomalous effects occur if the map is folded.

//Note: When I shifted it to French Guiana, it apparently treated the French Region as an independent state, with its Arrondissements (3rd tier in France) and Communes (5th tier in France) treated as its first and second tier administrative regions. -Cleveland//

//Note: Right now, I&#39;ve set the map to the area of Georgia, Abkhazia, both Ossetias, and that whatever Karachay-Cherkessia and Kabardino-Balkaria that is. It&#39;s in the break room for those of you wanting it. -Cleveland//

The number itself has a cognitohazardous effect that, if fully enumerated (which, given current technology, is impossible given the impossibility to calculate the full value of Graham&#39;s Number), will wipe out all life (up to and inclusive of [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-682 | SCP-682]]]) in the universe. As the existence of θ′ itself has been contained, it is necessary for researchers to be notified of this derived number.

//Note: By inserting files of a researcher and an SCP subject, I ended up with this cognitohazard of a number. To whoever is next, I have this warning: 914 is unpredictable. Don&#39;t mess it around. -Cleveland//

**Test 914-0429**
**Name:** Jr. Researcher Stan
**Date:** 19/02/2019
**Total Items:** One squeezable plastic pouch of instant drink mix, fruit punch flavored

**Input:** Drink mix
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A similarly shaped pouch to the original. The label read &#34;**Bomb**astic Explosive Flavor!&#34; with no nutrition information or ingredients.

//Note: We&#39;ve decided to test this in a reinforced chamber with a remote arm. I think you know why. -Stan//

//Results: A technician operated the remote arm from behind reinforced glass with Jr. Researcher Stan. The remote arm poured the mix into a glass of water. Drink mix was shown to be colored bright red. Upon fully diffusing into the water, it began to violently react and created a small explosion, destroying the glass and sending shards throughout the room. Remote arm and drink pouch were unharmed.//

//Note: I was expecting something more grenade-like, but it was awesome anyway. We got permission to break open to pouch over a 20-liter tub. -Stan//

//Results: Remote arm was used to crush the pouch, spilling most of its contents into the tub. After roughly five minutes, the water in the tub began to react, bubbling and spilling its contents, making loud gurgling noises. A loud bang is audible as the camera feed cuts out. Later inspection shows the camera was destroyed when a piece of the tub impacted it and broke it open, allowing water to damage the circuitry. The remote arm was also destroyed by a mixture of blunt force damage, shrapnel, and water.//

//Note: Anybody got some clean pants I can borrow? -Stan//

**Test 914-0439**
**Name:** Jr. Researcher Stan
**Date:** 21/02/2019
**Total Items:** One box of various Nerf brand foam and rubber darts.

**Input:** Box of darts
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Pile of modified darts. The rubber tips appear to have been melted and hardened into slugs fitted into foam casings. The bottoms of the casings are designed to compress air going in and launch the slugs at high speed. The amount of rubber needed to create a slug that fit the casings appears to have been borrowed from other darts, as there were fewer output darts than input and a small pile of foam was found in the output chamber. Slugs cannot be refit into their respective casings after being fired.

//Note: They fit into standard Nerf blasters and magazines, but there isn&#39;t any way to eject spent shells, meaning that you can only use one dart. They work best with the blasters that use revolving barrels to contain darts. Did I mention that they sting really bad?// - Stan

//Note: Nerf wars are prohibited on site grounds, no matter how &#34;fun they are.&#34; - Dr. Veritas//

A steady stream of saliva consistently exits this mouth. Before expiring, the subject vocalized //&#34;and all the players a stage&#34;// to 5 nearby security guards that were attempting to neutralize it.

//I heard those words. I heard them clearly. I wasn&#39;t there, but I heard them. It looked like a puppet, because it was. I was in the other room, hearing the rusted gears of 914. I heard that **thing.** It has a point, you know?  Me and my other coworkers agree. Syeda won&#39;t be forgotten.// -Dr. Alex

**Date:** 07/03/2019
**Total Items:** One 2 kg block of sculpting clay

**Input:** As stated above
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** Beehive sculpted out of clay. When disturbed, several clay honeybees flew out of multiple hidden holes on the hive&#39;s surface. They appear to have been flying through anomalous means. The bees were unable to sting any of the personnel present due to the softness of their material, but they were able to fly into them at high speeds. This tactic would cause the bees to destroy themselves, but left large welts on the personnel&#39;s skin. The beehive was eventually destroyed by security. Analysis showed that the structure of the hive was a complex series of tunnels and empty honeycombs.

**Output:** A book on the topic of slavery, war, and violence throughout the world&#39;s history.

//Note: Okay, I didn&#39;t think that 914 would bring up that kind of political history but here we are. -Dr. Leopold//

//Note: I don&#39;t actually think it intentionally brings this up. From my experience (which is substantial), it&#39;s not actually clear if 914 is sapient or that it&#39;s more like an A.I. that makes assumptions based on information given to it, without really understanding what it&#39;s saying on a conceptual level. Then again, it loves taking the piss out of Calloway, so who knows. - Veritas//

**Test 914-0475**
//RaISA Notice:// The following test was recorded before the Foundation&#39;s modern record keeping, as such it may not represent current documentation protocol. Furthermore it did not occur after the test listed before it.

It has come to my attention that personnel frequently submit proposals to use naturally occurring phenomenon in SCP-914. SCP-914 modifies (not //improves//) objects based around their current state and the &#34;purpose&#34;, ergo assuming there isn&#39;t a creator deity or similar; a rock should be null in purpose. While the curiosity and creative application of an SCP item is admirable, it has become annoying for all parties involved. For this reason I&#39;m attaching the one time that was attempted and why we won&#39;t ever try it again. You&#39;d better be grateful for this; I had to go into some dark bowls of Site-19&#39;s archive to get these. I&#39;m still not sure I was the only thing down there.

The assisting staff are currently recovering from burns in the [REDACTED] hospital. Dr. Langford was unaffected due to his distance from the test.
//Update (20/03/1926):// The burned staff have begun to show symptoms inconsistent with burns, possibly abnormal in nature. These symptoms include a general poorly defined sickness (nausea, weakness, headaches, etc) and most notably a loss of hair. The medical ward is presently closed off from the rest of the facility.
//Update:Update (22/03/1926)// Following progression of the aforementioned symptoms, the staff have died. Attending medical staff are not showing symptoms. Classification of the corpses as an SCP item is being considered.
//Update (06/08/1945):// The symptoms noted in the staff have been discovered occurring en-masse under mundane circumstances and is no longer considered to be an abnormality. The bodies have been given a proper burial.

//Pre-Test Note: The dial of the machine was removed during the test.//

**Input:** One #2 Pencil
**Setting:** N/A
**Output:** One #1 Pencil, sharpened

**Input:** One #2 Pencil
**Setting:** N/A
**Output:** One broken pencil, with various cuts and bite marks around it

**Input:** One #2 Pencil
**Setting:** N/A
**Output:** One #14 Pencil. When held, it seems to write whatever the holder is thinking.

//Note: It looks like the output is completely random, as if a setting was chosen. The settings it seemed to choose were 1:1, Rough or Coarse, then Fine or Very Fine, in that order. Dial returned to 914 after the test. -Dr. Blane//

//Note: 3 HOURS POST-TEST: The #14 pencil from test 3 is gone, replaced by a #2 pencil with the words &#34;Veritas&#34; written on it. So if it was swapped with one of his pencils, uh... sorry?  -Dr. Blane//

//Note: Thanks for the heads-up, but I&#39;m not enough of a megalomaniac to have custom pencils made with my name on it. I&#39;d also like to know who gave you permission to remove the dial panel. - Veritas//

**Test 914-0480**
**Name:** Dr. Lucius Veritas
**Date:** 22/03/2019
**Total Items:** Three office lamps

//Note: I&#39;m running a test to see if 914 is still functioning properly (relatively speaking) after the removal of the panel, which has been reattached.//

**Input:** One office lamp
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** A disassembled office lamp, with the components sorted based on size.

**Input:** One office lamp.
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** An office lamp, seemingly unchanged. Turned on, it appears to block light reaching the retinas of all organisms within a 5 meter radius, effectively blinding them until they move out of its range.

//Note: An anti-lamp. Huh. - Veritas//

**Input:** One office lamp.
**Setting:** Very fine (D-Class Personnel was employed to retrieve and test the result).
**Output:** One office lamp. When activated, it emits Gamma radiation. D-Class Personnel expired due to acute radiation poisoning. Notably, when the lamp was deactivated by remotely controlled drone, all traces of radiation dissipated immediately, unlike normal Gamma radiation which can linger for centuries.

//Note: So, the logic behind this is that light is essentially a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum with a wavelength inside the visible spectrum. Increase the frequency enough, and you get ultraviolet light, X-rays, and eventually Gamma rays. 914 seems to be functioning as well as can be expected in its state, carry on people. - Veritas//

**Output:** White Phosphorus Grenade (Ring Pulled)
//Note: EVERYBODY OUT NOW!!//

//Incident Report: Researcher I. Darby was severely wounded by White Phosphorous in his attempt to force his Assistant Personnel and Security Escort out of the SCP-914 Containment Area. SCP-914 was  not damaged but its Containment Area requires cleaning and minor repair, Researcher I. Darby has been returned to the ICU and has been banned from using SCP-914 until he is fully healed. - Site Manager//

//Note: Maybe SCP-914 is still on the Fritz after that panel got taken off -  Jr. Researcher Norton//

//Note: Every test this guy does is a spit in Darwin&#39;s face. It&#39;s a miracle that he survived this long, I have half a mind to have him classified as an anomalous object. Someone get me a bloody aspirin. - Veritas//

**Test 914-0485**
**Name:** Dr. Artium
**Date:** 23/03/2019
**Total items:** One copy of a biography on the life of &#34;Stan Lee&#34;, one Lenovo laptop  

**Input:** Above mentioned
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:**  The laptop was wrapped in what appeared to be the pages of the book however no writing was present on any papers. Upon removing the the paper the top of the laptop seemed to be replaced with the original cover material of said book, all Lenovo logos on the laptop were replaced with the word &#34;excelsior&#34;. On starting up the laptop researchers were met with an animated humanoid on screen who resembled the late &#34;Stan Lee&#34;. The humanoid was able to speak and respond to questions asked of it and several questions related to the life of &#34;Stan Lee&#34; were answered accurately.

**Test 914-0486**
**Name:** Maintenance Technician Johnson
**Date:** 23/03/2019
**Total Items:** 300 identical florescent light bulbs

//Note: I want to see if large amounts of identical items will affect the output in any noticeable way.//

**Input:** 100 identical florescent light bulbs
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One very large florescent light bulb

//Note: We don&#39;t use the model of the input lights here, so I guess this is about as useful to us. - MT Johnson//

**Input:** 100 identical florescent light bulbs.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** 46 identical incandescent light bulbs filled with florescent gas. 22 of the bulbs subsequently collapsed due to  the pressure differential between the gas inside and outside the bulbs.

//Note: Incandescent light bulbs are supposed to have a non-reactive gas inside them, not the opposite of that. These lights are extremely inefficient, extremely bright (but not as bright as some pre-existing alternatives), and extremely short-lasting (averaging 1 hour use before burning out), effectively making them useless. I&#39;ve left them in non-anomalous item storage, just in case someone thinks up a use for them. - MT Johnson//

**Input:** 100 identical florescent light bulbs
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One floating sphere made of plastic and metal surrounded by a sphere of glowing gas. Moving the sphere with tools (as the heat produced by the object made physically touching it impossible) caused the sphere of gas to move with it. The gas remained anomalously stable during transport, remaining in a perfect sphere around the core at all times, regardless of the speed or direction of transport.

//Note: This... shouldn&#39;t be working like this. Florescent bulbs work by producing UV light, which then gets converted into visible light by the glass of the bulb, so we shouldn&#39;t be seeing anything but the core. Also, how the heck is this thing producing heat and light with no input whatsoever? Then again, this was made by 914. I&#39;m pretty sure that it&#39;s never heard of the laws of physics, or at least doesn&#39;t take them seriously. - MT Johnson//

**Test 914-0488**
**Name:** Researcher Gailen
**Date:** 25/03/2019
**Total Items:** One USB drive containing a copy of the Valve game //Portal 2//, One 10cmx10cm picture of MT Johnson

//Note: I want to see how 914 reacts to MT Johnson again, as well as more of Valve&#39;s games. I find both to be very amusing. -Researcher Gailen//

**Input:** Picture of MT Johnson
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** 10cmx10cm Picture of Cave Johnson from //Portal 2//. Upon viewing the picture, the subject is compelled to say &#34;Cave Johnson, we&#39;re done here.&#34; and exit the room.

//Note: This hindered the test significantly as everyone would walk into the room and then back out over and over again. And I forgot about Cave Johnson there, Johnson and Johnson... -Researcher Gailen//


**Input:** One copy of //Portal 2//
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** --No change-- A copy of //Portal 2//, but the voice of and all images of Cave Johnson have been replaced by the voice of and the face of MT Johnson.

**Total Items:**

//Note: Guess what? I&#39;m back. I was cleared charges and saved from D-Class status because I had been affected by several memetics, thanks to 914. Let&#39;s see how it reacts to me. -Researcher// Calloway//

**Input:** 1 note, reading &#34;I&#39;m back, 914.&#34;
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** 1 note with a decorative heart drawn on it.

//Note: Wait, what?//

**Input:** 1 note, reading &#34;Did you miss me?&#34;
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** 1 note with Researcher Calloway&#39;s name, heavily decorated.

//Note: Is all of this over? Can I finally have peace with this machine?//

**Input:** 1 note with Researcher Calloway&#39;s name, heavily decorated.
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** 1 piece of paper, with a cognitohazardous symbol drawn on it. When a subject views it, the subject immediately feels the compulsion to rhythmically bang their head on a wall.

//Note: Calloway was rushed to the medical bay, and we have the thing in a box, where no one can see it. -Sergeant Richard Hammer//

//Note: For Christ&#39;s sake, Darby and Calloway seem to be competing to gets to be killed the fastest. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s more merciful: Ban them from testing or let natural selection take care of it. - Veritas//

**Total Items:** One slip of paper with a &#39;&#39;smiley face&#39;&#39; printed on it and one mug.

**Input:** One paper
**Setting:** 1:1 with the &#34;mood&#34; panel on Jovial //original panel was replaced with the mood one after turning the dial to 1:1.//
**Output:** A slip of paper that folded its self in to a paper airplane. It makes a whistling sound when thrown.

//Note: Can I keep this one? -Intern Lunar//

**Input:** One mug
**Setting:** Animal //mood panel was replaced with the &#34;attribute&#34; one after turning the dial to a blank spot.//
**Output:** An animate cat mug with the mouth of the mug on the cat&#39;s back. Cat seems to enjoy being filled with a liquid. This however, is a hazard if the liquid is hot, as the cat still will roll around on its back possibly ruining papers or causing burns. It also seems to enjoy knocking things off of desks as well as sleeping on keyboards.

//Note: Ok, this is adorable. Can I please keep this? cxvtrsdfrvASDAD -Intern Lunar//

//Note: Lunar, You&#39;re clearly new here if you think that keeping anomalous objects is a good idea. Keep them, but I&#39;m not responsible for what happens to you because of it. Don&#39;t use it after midnight, as a precaution. -Veritas//
 
//Update: It eats and excretes. I need a litter box. Also I&#39;m the intern, so thanks for telling me. -Intern Lunar//

//Note: Who let an intern use 914 without supervision? Also, Why do we have interns in the first place? - Researcher Darby//

//Note: My supervisor let me. Also I would assume so they can see if I should be hired? - Intern Lunar//

**Test 914-0495**
**Name:** Dr. Sheath
**Date:** 28/03/2019
**Total Items:** Five plastic Lego bricks
//Note: I&#39;m sure we all know what&#39;s going to happen if we use the new &#34;malicious&#34; option. What I want to know is if the option selected before adding the new panel impacts the result. For all of these tests, the original panel was turned to a setting, removed, and replaced with the mood panel, which was then set to malicious. - Dr. Sheath//

**Input:** One plastic Lego brick
**Setting of original panel:** Rough
**Setting of mood panel:** Malicious
**Output:** One plastic Lego brick which shattered into fragments upon being picked up.

**Input:** One plastic Lego brick
**Setting of original panel:** Coarse
**Setting of mood panel:** Malicious
**Output:** One plastic Lego brick. Despite fitting perfectly, it is incapable of stacking with other Lego bricks.

**Input:** One plastic Lego brick
**Setting of original panel:** 1:1
**Setting of mood panel:** Malicious
**Output:** One plastic Lego brick. The studs are notably sharper, being triangular rather than circular.

**Input:** One plastic Lego brick
**Setting of original panel:** Fine
**Setting of mood panel:** Malicious
**Output:** One plastic Lego brick, now possessing an anomalous property wherein, if a person is walking within 25 meters of it with no footwear on, it will automatically transport itself to a spot under their foot.

//Note: ...Oh dear. I was expecting that to be the Very Fine result. Now I&#39;m scared... - Dr. Sheath//

**Input:** One plastic Lego brick
**Setting of original panel:** Very Fine
**Setting of mood panel:** Malicious
**Output:** One plastic Lego brick. When coming into contact with any surface, studs in the style of Lego bricks appear on that surface within three seconds of contact. Dr. Sheath was sent to the medical bay after the aforementioned studs appeared on his hand after picking it up. The Lego brick has been sent to anomalous item storage.

//Note: It doesn&#39;t hurt or anything, and it hasn&#39;t spread beyond my hand, but it hasn&#39;t gone away yet. I could probably live with it, but it&#39;d be really inconvenient... - Dr. Sheath//

//Note: Look on the bright side; you can now build on your hand!  -Dr. Fante//

**Total Items** Three copies of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-096 SCP-096]&#39;s file

**Input:** One copy of SCP-096&#39;s file
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** An edited copy of SCP-096&#39;s file. The description and containment procedures have been heavily altered, describing SCP-096 in a manner that is heavily contrasting to its actual behavior.

//Note: That definitely could have been much worse - Dr. Piedmont//

**Input:** One copy of SCP-096&#39;s file
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** An edited copy of SCP-096&#39;s file. An extra addendum has been added to the bottom of the page. Said addendum details multiple containment breaches of SCP-096.

**Input:** One copy of SCP-096&#39;s file
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** An edited copy of SCP-096&#39;s file. The words on the page have been jumbled in order to create an accurate visual of SCP-096&#39;s face. Viewing this recreation of its face results in no anomalous effects.

//Note: This is actually pretty tame for things 914 has done in the past. I might hang this on my wall. - Dr.Piedmont//

//Note: I&#39;m putting 5 dollars on this man not lasting a week, he just seems to have that special relationship with 914 that me and Calloway share - Researcher Darby//

//Note: I like those odds, I&#39;ll put another 5 on top of that. - Dr. Piedmont//

**Test 914-0497**
**Name:** Guest Researcher Prof. Wren
**Date:** 30/03/2019
**Total Items:** One piece of 8.5&#34;x11&#34; paper, one mechanical pencil with 0.3mm lead

//Note: The professor&#39;s clearances were reinstated after remedial training on 914&#39;s functionality.//

//Note: Okay, first off, my bad about last time. Anyway, I&#39;ve heard that this device isn&#39;t sentient, but from the test records involving Darby and Calloway alone, I&#39;m fairly sure it has a sense of humor...and quite possibly a vendetta. Let&#39;s test that first one out. - Guest Researcher Prof. Wren//

**Input:** A note card reading &#34;Know any good jokes?&#34;
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A note card reading &#34;Knock knock.&#34;

//Note: Huh. Gotta be honest, I was half expecting it to be something insulting. Well, let&#39;s roll with it, see how this plays out. - Guest Researcher Prof. Wren//

**Input:** The same note card, with the previous note erased. It now reads &#34;Who&#39;s there?&#34;
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A note card reading &#34;Peak hatch.&#34;

//Note: Peak ha--oh good grief. I think I can already tell where this is going. -Guest Researcher Prof. Wren//

**Input:** A note card reading &#34;Peak hatch who?&#34;
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** The note card is now folded into the shape of a rodent-like creature, confirmed to be the mascot of the //Pokémon// franchise. Upon the creature&#39;s name being uttered, the sound of 2 snare drums and a cymbal were heard from an unknown location.

//Note: Well, I suppose the test was only to see IF 914 had a sense of humor, not how GOOD of one it had. Maybe if I&#39;d given it the whole pencil it could have written out something better? -Guest Researcher Prof. Wren//

**Test 914-0498**
**Name:** Dr. Piedmont
**Date:** 31/03/2019
**Total Items:** One image of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-173 SCP-173], a sharpie

//Note: We haven&#39;t seen how SCP-914&#39;s new &#34;mood&#34; settings affects images yet. My prediction is that it will be more-or-less the same as usual, but you never know with 914. -Dr. Piedmont//

**Input:** One image of SCP-173, a sharpie
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Mood Setting:** Jovial
**Output:** An image of SCP-173 with a handlebar mustache and a top hat drawn onto his head and a slightly used sharpie.

//Note: I wonder how far we can take this -Dr. Piedmont//

**Input:** The above result
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Mood Setting:** Jovial
**Output:** An edit of the above image. SCP-173 now has a monocle and a crudely drawn cane next to its &#34;hand&#34;. An even more used sharpie

**Input:** The above result
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Mood Setting:** Jovial
**Output:** An edit of the above image. The background of the image is now a fancy party drawn with a sharpie, with multiple other SCPs in the background dressed the same way SCP-173 is. A sharpie that is out of ink.

//Note: It was later discovered that an image of SCP-096 drawn in sharpie was on the back of the photo. Analysis into why SCP-914 drew this when the image was of SCP-173 is ongoing. I am currently not liking the odds that Researcher Darby gave me. -Dr. Piedmont//

//Note: Well, if you last a week I&#39;ll throw you a cupcake party, and 10 dollars for winning the bet. Also, can I have this picture? I find it highly amusing - Researcher Darby//

//Note: I highly doubt I&#39;ll last the week, but you can have the photo. - Dr. Piedmont//

**Test 914-0499**
**Name:** Dr. Harper
**Date:** 01/04/2019
**Total Items:** Twenty standard stainless steel ball-peen hammers with oak wood handles

//Note: The purpose of these tests is to properly catalogue the possibilities that the
recently manufactured extra panels might offer. Authorization for an exemption to the
ban on biological testing pending, I&#39;ve opted not to pursue the Animal and Vegetable
settings, or the remaining Mineral setting for that matter. - Dr. Harper//

**Input:** One Ball-peen hammer
**Setting:** Rough
**Mood setting:** Curious
**Output:** A ball-peen hammer, sliced into neat 2cm thick portions, arranged into a neat semicircle.

**Input:** One Ball-peen hammer
**Setting:** Coarse
**Mood Setting:** Curious
**Output:** A scraped and battered ball-peen hammer, inscribed with obscure sentences and pictograms. Analysis on their possible meaning is ongoing, though low-priority.

**Input:** One Ball-peen hammer
**Setting:** 1:1
**Mood Setting:** Curious
**Output:** An irregularly-shaped ball-peen hammer with a stainless steel handle and a wooden head.

**Input:** One Ball-peen hammer
**Setting:** Fine
**Mood Setting:** Curious
**Output:** A music box composed of oak and stainless steel which plays the hook of &#34;U Can&#39;t Touch This&#34; by MC Hammer.

**Input:** One Ball-peen hammer
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Mood Setting:** Curious
**Output:** A small war hammer adorned with Nordic runes. When held by a human, the holder is possessed by an entity calling itself &#39;Asmund&#39;, claiming to be a deceased viking warrior. Entity is mostly non-hostile, and will primarily recount glorified tales of its supposed exploits. Removing item reverts its holder to their normal state of mind.

**Input:** One Ball-peen hammer
**Setting:** Rough
**Mood Setting:** Malicious
**Output:** Ashes and molten steel. Molten steel proved excessively difficult to remove - ultimately requiring the entire output booth floor to be replaced.

//Note: Usually 914 resorts to scare tactics or physical harm. Toil is an entirely other
echelon of malice, I&#39;d say. - Dr. Harper//

**Input:** One Ball-peen hammer
**Setting:** Coarse
**Mood Setting:** Malicious
**Output:** Item appeared unchanged. A D-class was instructed to retrieve it. Upon touch, the item collapsed seemingly into dust. Testing has determined that breathing the dust will cause an allergic reaction in which an itchy rash will form whenever the recipient is in physical contact with hammers.

**Input:** One Ball-peen hammer
**Setting:** 1:1
**Mood Setting:** Malicious
**Output:** A hammer which had been stretched to a length of 4 meters and 22 centimeters, fitting into the output chamber from corner to corner. Item was broken in two in order to retrieve it. Item weighs exactly the same as the original hammer.

**Input:** One Ball-peen hammer
**Setting:** Fine
**Mood Setting:** Malicious
**Output:** A hammer which switches places with whatever item it hits. No upper limit to the weight or dimensions of such objects has been found.

//Note: This is a major containment issue. When in contact with any matter, it counts
even tiny vibrations as &#34;hitting&#34;, eventually wriggling out of piles of sand and even
jelly. Currently our best bet at containment is to suspend it in mid-air magnetically. I
shudder to think what would happen if this thing ever touched bedrock. - Dr. Harper//

**Input:** One Ball-peen hammer
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Mood Setting:** Malicious
**Output:** A hammer that did not initially display any deviations from the input item. Testing was at first inconclusive. After 24 hours of disuse, the item duplicated itself. Further testing has confirmed that the [[[SCP-871 |item duplicates itself whenever it isn&#39;t used at least once in any given 24 hour period, with all copies retaining the anomalous properties.]]] All resulting hammers successfully contained.
