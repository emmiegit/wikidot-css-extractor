++ FROM THE OFFICE OF SITE DIRECTOR LEAH RICHTER
----
//The following notice has been disseminated to all new researchers transferring to Site-78.//

Hello, Colleagues. This is Site Director Leah Richter, wanting to extend a hand to all who volunteered to transfer to our site or have recently been hired. This document has been made for you to review remotely and will be shown at the in-person orientation. As a disclaimer, Site-78 does not endorse any of the opinions held therein. The following video makes some inflammatory statements against certain parties, one of them is me.

Despite this, however, this orientation video is to remain as HR has made the executive decision to keep the video. This was done on the grounds that it not only increased our employee retention rate by 25% but seems to have also boosted workplace morale.

I cannot argue with the results but I do warn you that what you are about to watch is... different. To say the least.

**Chudley:** Hello and welcome, newbies! If you weren&#39;t shot at the door or the memetic kill agent didn&#39;t get you; welcome to the Site-78 orientation video/dossier!

**Johnston:** Chudley, you&#39;re going to scare the transfers. No one is getting shot or memetically killed.

**Chudley:** That is what we want them to think. The kill agent juuuuuuuust needs a bit more time to work.

**Johnston:** A-anyways! Welcome to R&amp;D Site-78! The nicest place in Chugwater, Wyoming! Most likely, you have already been briefed that our cover story for this place is that we are an Archive Facility for the U.S armed forces. You are to make sure you carry your fake military IDs with you at all times.

**Chudley:** I don&#39;t think we&#39;re here to bore them with the secrecy stuff, we gotta sell them on this place.

**Johnston:** I was getting to that. Site-78 is primarily a Research and Development facility, all of you have been chosen for your expertise in the various fields of anomalous science. We also are the home of the SCP-6952 warfare project where we develop the latest in anomalous weapons and armor.

**Chudley:** Translation: Laser guns and teleportation gloves.

**Johnston:** And if they have the proper clearance, they might just get to work on them. But work at Site-78 is not all testing fancy guns or running lab work. You may be assigned to assist foreign branches through our outreach program - and if you prove your mettle, then you might just end up in one of our more secret programs. You may have received the notice from the O5 Council on the Set of Nine but most of you probably have never heard of that.

**Chudley:** You should have counted yourselves lucky. Now we have to get into the meat of things.

**Johnston:** That leads us to our next section. The History of Site-78.

[Begin Playback]

**Johnston:** In this next section, we&#39;ll be going over the history of our site. Firstly I&#39;ll explain the logo. The Site-78 emblem is that of the Nine Realms of Norse Mythology. It was only fitting with our Site&#39;s new existence being based around the Set of Nine that we chose a logo with a nine-fold pattern.

[[f&lt;image https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/695756780940296376/1027702988141232128/site-78.svg width=&#34;200px&#34;]]

**Chudley:** I really don&#39;t want to think about what would happen if our new logo leaked. You know how groups like the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/4r-hub Fourth Reich] enjoy that kind of iconography. They might confuse us for friends or something stupid like that.

**Johnston:** Chudley, shut up. Do NOT go there.

**Chudley:** Someone in the room was probably thinking of it.

**Johnston:** Ugh. Anyway back to our history. Our site was founded on January 12th, 2012 by-

**Chudley:** (Under his breath) //A real hard-ass with a nice ass-//
[Johnston elbows Chudley in the ribs]

**Johnston:** -//Leah Erin Richter//, and her research team. They had been given a grant to start their own research facilities due to their dissertation on the Little Foundation located on [[[SCP-6011]]].

**Chudley:** You heard it here first folks. Your new Site Director is a Flat Earther.

**Johnston:** That is a gross oversimplification of that anomaly. (clears throat) With their hard work this Research Facility soon grew into the Site-78 you see today but back then it was mostly just focused on Research and the amount of MTFs we had was small. There were a few anomalies kept here but not very much.

**Chudley:** That was until 2022 rolled around on the Site&#39;s 12th anniversary. I still remember it like it was yesterday… Best one yet…

**Johnston:** You don&#39;t have to tell it if you don&#39;t want to.

**Chudley:** Nah. I got it. (Clears Throat). One of our MTFs raided a CI facility and we got our hands on SCP-6419. The project was headed up by my, uh, boss and mentor, Todd Jackson… Little did we know at the time that SCP-6419 was a fully sentient, psychotic book meant to bring destruction to the foundation by those Chaos fucks… oh, and that it had us all under its control. Things escalated, and it caused a massive containment breach, we fell right into a CI trap, or maybe it was the book itself. We still don’t know…

[Johnston looks at her colleague morosely before continuing.]

**Johnston:** Within the month following those events, Valravn Corporation came into conflict with the Volk Division, another group of anomalous mercenaries utilizing another anomalous book - part of a series of nine individual tomes termed the Set of Nine. Valravn Corporation traded with the O5 council - information, and we were given what is now known as SCP-6952 for containment.

**Chudley:** Those Viking cosplayers are bad news, but we couldn&#39;t pass up the opportunity with such an incredibly dangerous object. That led to the question of which sites would be tasked with finding the PoI responsible for the remainder of The Set. Most of us felt responsible for what happened to the former Pataphysics director Jackson, so Director Richter decided to throw our hats in the ring.


[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Archived correspondence between the O5 Council and Site Director Richter&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**O5-1:** Alright, Site Director Leah Erin Richter of Site-78. Your Site is the one currently containing book two of the Set of Nine, SCP-6419... correct?

**Richter:** That is correct sir.

**O5-2:** You already have one in your possession but that was merely due to the Chaos Insurgency&#39;s plotting correct? Or did the anomaly orchestrate that? It was unclear in the documentation.

**Richter:** It is currently uncertain - however, despite our lack of firepower we successfully defended the site, smashed the insurgency, and re-contained our anomalies.

**O5-3:** A good answer. But tell us why your Site should be the one to hold the Set of Nine. Don&#39;t you think that it would be smarter to split them all up? This seems disastrous to me.

**O5-4:** Yours is just an R&amp;D facility, there are bigger sites that can handle this project. Perhaps they would even be safer on the Lunar Facility, away from the reach of Valravn and whoever else might seek it - judging from the known objects, this series of tomes will be wildly dangerous and sought after. It seems unwise - irresponsible, in fact, to bring it to your facility.

**Richter:** I humbly disagree, with O5-3 and O5-4. While it is true that the books could potentially have a secondary effect when they are assembled, it would make determining such a thing harder if they were all split up across the globe. We understand these books the best of anyone in the foundation at present, and if one Site has access to them it will be easier to study and research them and the effects they have on each other. As for the defense of the Site holding The Set… I wouldn&#39;t worry about that.

**O5-2:** Oh? Why is that?

**Richter:** Because of SCP-6952. I&#39;ve read the early documentation, and thanks to our existing development capacities my Site has the infrastructure to begin producing its recipes. My Site may be small for now but I&#39;ve built it over these past twelve years to be a highly diversified facility with Researchers from all fields. This Set of Nine could be anything, we only have two of the books and have no idea what the others are like. At Site-78 you don&#39;t have to worry about facing something you don&#39;t know because there is an expert here who would know. Give me more funding and resources, transfer more researchers and soldiers my way and I&#39;ll take SCP-6952 and turn it into one of the most useful Thaumiels our organization has ever seen.

**O5-3:** It’s good to see you’re just as confident as you were 10 years ago when we gave you that site - but I must ask why you are so ardent in keeping such hotly contested and dangerous items with Site-78. This is atypical of your behavior Richter - we know you to be cautious, not ostentatious or glory seeking. You’re a researcher for goodness sake, not an MTF captain.

**Richter:** I do this solely for the betterment of Humanity. It&#39;s what Site-78 has always strived for. I can see evil moving in to make use of these anomalous grimoires, and frankly, I see now that we can’t always be innocent scholars for the foundation. It&#39;s time to put down the microscopes and pick up a Gauss Rifle for the future of us all. For Site-78 to complete its mission, it needs those books - and trust me, we are more than prepared to do what is necessary to see this through.

(Ten seconds of silence.)

**O5-1:** …Quite inspiring, Director Richter. Truly. To be honest, you&#39;re the only Site Director who came to us with not just noble intentions, but also the backbone to follow through. It’s hard to find both qualities in our most astute minds and leaders. Have you said your piece then?

[Richter clears her throat]

**Richter.** Yes…Yes that is all I have to say. Thank you O5-Council.

**O5-1:** Then this meeting is adjourned. We shall cast our votes and determine the next course of action. Your time and efforts are appreciated, Director Richter.

**Johnston:** If you decided to look at the correspondence included with this document, you can see that her plea went well. Afterward, it was decided to initiate a program of active anomaly containment - Afterall, a bunch of scrubs and labcoats getting super nukes and magnet guns would be rather suspicious to outsiders. By actively containing anomalies like other sites have in the past, we provide a plausible cover story and throw off suspicion.

**Chudley:** I think you are forgetting who leads this program, Researcher Johnston.

**Johnston:** (sighs) Chudley. we are not talking about MAUDE. It doesn&#39;t exist, we don&#39;t have the proper authorization to make it a real department.

**Chudley:** Yes, Maria, I&#39;m aware, just as YOU&#39;RE AWARE that we&#39;ve received word from MULTIPLE , //legitimate// sources that they&#39;re going to go ahead with authorizing -

**Johnston:** Your sources are that you made them the fuck up. Continuing, we had new containment wings built and we reinforced our number of soldiers. Under my direction, we had new engineering and weapons testing facilities built to capitalize on the discoveries made from SCP-6952&#39;s schematics and anomalous materials - afterall, just cause you can make death beams doesn’t mean you have men trained to do it safely.

**Chudley:** Wow look at you with all your massive accomplishments, I&#39;m sure nobody else contributed to all that - definitely not, couldn’t be-

**Johnston:** You’ve been in DING DONG TEXAS for 8 fucking months, I don’t wanna hear //you// say a damn thing! (smiles to camera) To end off, to all you new recruits. We must stand ready against any threat that comes against the Foundation. Site-78&#39;s motto is &#34;For the Betterment of Humanity&#34;, which cannot be achieved while the Set of Nine is still loose in the world.

**Chudley:** Agreed. Let&#39;s get those books... shall we?

[[tab Administration]]

**Site Director:** Leah Erin Richter
**Motto:** //For the Betterment of Humanity.//

[Begin Playback]

**Chudley:** Site Director Leah Richter is a pain in my ass and just generally a bitch. Moving on.

**Johnston:** She is going to fire you once she watches this. I&#39;ll handle the profile. Ahem, if I had to best describe Site Director Richter, I would say stern and cold on the outside but deep down she cares about all of us. I can&#39;t say that I know much about her personally, other than her hate for Mr. Chudley over here. I will say that even if she might care about us here at Site-78, her loyalties are absolutely clear - nothing will compromise her devotion to the SCP Foundation and the O5 Council, she always follows orders no matter what they are.

**Chudley:** And as for what the Administration department does, they are our bosses. They handle the money and how much stuff we get to blow up. They keep in touch with all the important people, RAISA, Ethics, and the O5s to make sure we&#39;re all following regulations. And Leah’s job is to ride my ass.

[[tab Aeronautics and Astrophysics Department]]

**Lead Researcher:** Dr. Matthew Vincent
**Motto:** //Into the void.//
[Begin Playback]
**Johnston:** Dr. Matthew Vincent is one of the newest department heads at our facility. He has dedicated his life to the study of Interstellar Anomalies, particularly those of the Church of the Second Hytoth and the civilizations in the Terthan 2 cluster.-

**Chudley:** Wait, those are fucking real?

**Johnston:** (Loudly clears throat) His work at the Damocles Initiative makes him one of the leading minds in anomalous space travel. I would describe him as eccentric and driven, in other words, he fits in with us misfits at Site-78 like a glove, and his presence was sorely needed.

**Chudley:** But you are probably wondering, why did we need an Aeronautics department? Well, to put it bluntly, our serpentine foe hinted that one of the books may be in space.

**Johnston:** Specifically the Terthan 2 cluster. That&#39;s why we needed an expert on the Hytoth. We hope that we&#39;ll be able to make contact with one of the civilizations and find out if there truly is one of the books out there. We hope to have an FTL-capable spacefaring vessel by late 2023 but we aren&#39;t holding our breath.

[[tab Arms and Equipment Department]]
**Lead Researcher:** Maria Johnston
**Motto:** //Forged in the fires of Hephaestus&#39;s furnace.//
[Begin Playback]

**Chudley:** Ah yes, it&#39;s time to talk about you.

**Maria:** Oh boy, let me have it. You&#39;ve been poking at me through our whole time recording, so let&#39;s hear it.

**Chudley:** Ah come on, Maria. This is your section. So it&#39;s time to hype you up. During the containment breach of Jan 2022, Johnston took command of a broken MTF unit whose commander was KIA. She rallied the men and lead the charge. Some say her icy glare caused the brains of all the CI in her path to explode anomalously.

 **Johnston:** I can&#39;t make people explode. I just used the environment against them, standard guerilla procedure.

**Chudley:** Maria Johnston is extraordinarily humble about her anomalous combat abilities which is why she was chosen to lead Arms and Equipment. In the time since then, she has proved that she doesn&#39;t just cosplay as a Samurai but she has the heart of one. Johnston, the floor is yours to talk about your department.

 **Johnston:** (Sighs) We at Arms and Equipment have been focused on producing the latest in Gauss and plasma Weaponry to punch through the armor of anomalous mercenaries and the hides of Tartarean entities. In addition to new methods of ballistics, Arms and Equipment has created state-of-the-art body armor that can protect a soldier from the spells of high-level thaumaturges or the weapons of Raptor Tec. Industries.

Arms and Equipment is the fastest growing department as it is tailored to the needs of Omega-45 and the growing threats in the anomalous world. As for our next projects we are looking to retrofit old Foundation armored vehicles and provide assistance to Aeronautics with their Starship program. I look forward to working with any incoming engineers, we certainly need the help.

[[tab Botanical Sciences Department]]

**Lead Researcher:** Lena Lorri
**Motto:** //The fruits of our labor will bear the seeds of tomorrow.//

[Begin Playback]

**Chudley:** Lorri! Yes. Lena Lorri. Her. She uh.... is boring?

**Johnston:** Come on Chudley, she&#39;s.... a... botanist. And she is... Okay, you got me on this one. I don&#39;t know anything about her either - I’m sorry Lena, I just never see you around…

**Chudley:** She doesn&#39;t talk to anyone and she&#39;s got her nose in her plants most days. I apologize if you get stuck working for Botanical sciences. They got majorly downsized due to the EVERSOR Initiative[[footnote]] Foundation effort to cut costs and earn more money in the wake of SCP-6004. [[/footnote]]. I don&#39;t even know why Richter keeps it around, we don&#39;t even have any plant-based anomalies here anymore.

**Johnston:** Well I for one don&#39;t think you should talk about your coworkers that way.

[[/tab]]
[[tab Department of Maude]]
**Lead Researcher:** Gregory J. Chudley
**Motto:** //The Department of the miscellaneous//

[Begin Playback]

**Johnston:** Alright, if you&#39;re really going to make me shoot a video on this one. I get to do the profile on you.

**Chudley:** I expect mad hype about the one and only, Greg Chudley. Don&#39;t let me down.

**Johnston:** Ahem, as much as we may bicker with each other; Greg Chudley is surprisingly - shockingly even, one of our most brilliant minds. Though you wouldn’t guess it in a hundred years from his…//creatively// written reports, he is an invaluable research asset to the foundation. His work during the evacuation for SCP-6419, and well conducted investigative efforts has more than earned him his position here with us at Site-78…

**Chudley:** Thank you, Maria.

**Johnston:** (smiles at camera)...but when he&#39;s //not// being bright? He&#39;s a lazy slacker that spends company time playing League of Legends, he actively participates in rituals involving new staff being subject to ridiculous if innocent jokes, and expects to get some work passed off on you if he&#39;s not feeling up for it so he can get back to watching reruns of Always Sunny!

**Chudley:**...Hurtful. Give me that Microphone. Alright ladies and gents, this video is about The Department of Mundane Artifacts and Uneventful Data Evaluation. But I like to call it MAUDE. Here at MAUDE we work with anomalies that don&#39;t fit into one particular department. You call us if your refrigerator actually starts running, or if you&#39;re told to call a number to find God and you actually do. MAUDE covers everything under the sun.

**Johnston:** In other words, Chudley is hyping up the worst assignment at this Site.

[[tab Pataphysics Department]]
**Lead Researcher:** Researcher Quinn Doodles
**Motto:**//Is this the real life? Or is it just a narrative?//

[Begin Playback]

**Chudley:** I promoted my good friend Researcher Quinn Doodles to lead the Pataphysics Department after I was asked to lead the Set of Nine Taskforce. Researcher Quinn has always been fascinated by media, particularly animation, and has dedicated his life to capturing anomalies that try to pervert this sacred art form.

**Johnston:** But what is Pataphysics, Chudley?

**Chudley:** Good question... Okay next question. Haha, I&#39;m kidding. To put it simply Pataphysics is the study of narratives, fiction, and media along with anomalies that affect them. Some like the great Andrew Swann believe that our universe is fictional and that we are affected by unseen writers from another universe.

Others would say someone simply wrote us to believe that our universe is fictional and that even the text is being manipulated right now. It&#39;s all just theory for now and the Pataphysics department&#39;s goal is to find out what truly is the relationship between physical and pataphysical.

**Johnston:** Well, I hope whoever is writing for you gets better at dialogue.

[[tab Set of Nine Taskforce (Level 4 Clearance Required)]]
**Lead Researcher:** Gregory J. Chudley
Motto: //The Set of Nine will not be assembled, that is a promise.//

[Begin Playback]

**Chudley:** Alright, enough messing around. This is the big boy department, the real deal assignment here at Site-78.

**Johnston:** Indeed. The Set of Nine Taskforce is headed by Chudley here with me as an assistant lead. This task force is by appointment only, if you are signed to work with any skips that are a part of the Set of Nine you will be given Level 4 clearance and moved under our joint department.

**Chudley:** We can&#39;t tell you much but if you get a letter, come down to Omega-45&#39;s wing of the complex. We’ll get you working on some of the real heavy duty stuff. In the event that you weren&#39;t supposed to view this video... please wait for the memetic kill agent to kick in.

**Johnston:** Chudley, you don&#39;t need to scare them before the amnestic they took starts to take effect.

[[/=]]

[Begin Playback]

**Chudley:** Last thing on the docket. Johnston, it&#39;s time you told them about our claim to fame. MTF-Omega 45, your Street Samurai.

**Johnston:** Well, I&#39;ll start with their creation. After the discovery of SCP-6952,  the O5 Council wanted a test of the effectiveness of SCP-6952-derived weaponry in the field and didn&#39;t want large amounts of this weaponry being used and lost to the enemy. And thus, I was chosen to create Omega-45, an elite fighting force that specialized in anomalous weaponry, armor, and vehicles. I serve as their operations officer in missions to retrieve high-risk anomalies and combat missions against hostile GoIs.

**Chudley:** I had a question, specifically about the nickname. I always thought you were a Shadowrun fan.

**Johnston:** I&#39;ve never really heard of Shadowrun before but the nickname came from their unorthodox fighting style and their martial prowess. I describe it as the perfect mix between the cunning of a street brawler and the discipline of a Samurai.

**Chudley:** Coincidences aside, if you find yourself working for Johnston you&#39;ll be helping develop and maintain Omega-45&#39;s gear.


**Johnston:** In addition you will be briefed on the relevant SCP documents regarding a few of our members. I have decided to allow anomalous beings to join Omega-45 to even our odds against the enemy. It&#39;s a risk but one I&#39;m willing to take. For those of you who end up working with us, I&#39;ve provided a dossier below this file on the Personnel you&#39;ll need to get acquainted with.

**Notable Members:**


[[tabview]]
[[tab Ω-45-1]]
* **Role:** Squad Leader
* **Real Name:** John Cassington
* **Age: 30**
* **Preferred weapons:** Rifles and Swords

**Description:** John Cassington is a decorated soldier, serving two tours in Afghanistan before being selected to join MTF-Sigma-26 (&#34;Shinigami&#39;s Eyes&#34;). Here he gained valuable experience fighting agents of the Chaos Insurgency and seeing firsthand the danger that the Set of Nine posed to the world. For this reason, he was chosen to lead MTF-Omega-45.

John has been described by his comrades as fiercely loyal and often comes to the defense of his anomalous comrades in routine audits of their performance as well as any harassment they may receive in the barracks and around Site-78. War can turn men rotten but for John, it seems it only made him a better person.
[[/tab]]
[[tab Ω-45-4]]
* **SCP Desgination:** SCP-7261-1
* **Role:** Undercover Operative/Shock Trooper
* **Real Name:** Michaela Avalerra
* **Age:** 26 but no longer biologically ages
* **Preferred weapons:** N/A, Personnel prefers to use their own abilities and thaumaturgy.
* **Special provisions:** Avalerra&#39;s equipment is to be covered in plastic to avoid triggering her allergy to metal. An undersuit and gloves are provided so the anomaly can utilize body armor and blades without issue. Anyone she is deployed with is to be given a spray of onion juice to curb her darker impulses.

**Description:** Hailing from Mexico, SCP-7261-1 is a hemovorous[[footnote]] Consumes blood for sustenance [[/footnote]] shapeshifter, capable of transforming into any animal as long she detaches her torso from her legs using thaumaturgy. In addition, 7261-1 displaces enhanced senses, strength, durability, and the ability to see in low-light environments. She is also a natural thaumaturge.

7261-1&#39;s unique abilities allow her to be used against other thaumaturgical beings as well as on stealth operations, using her transformations and enhanced vision to move about unnoticed.

7261-1&#39;s lifespan, however, is diminished, as she needs to consume the blood of one human juvenile every month. She appears to grow weaker as the months go by, eventually leading to her death. By Ethics Committee decree, 7261-1 is to be terminated if she is caught breaking her oath to the Foundation that she will not kill juveniles.

Personality-wise, SCP-7261-1 has been shown to have a strong moral compass; hating other instances affected by SCP-7261 and demanding that she personally be deployed to neutralize them. She&#39;s been described as headstrong and sarcastic. Out of all the members of Omega-45 she has the strongest relationship to Researcher Johnston who is working tirelessly to find a cure for 7261-1&#39;s condition.


[[/tab]]
[[tab Ω-45-5]]
* **Original Valravn Designation:** A-04, &#34;Thalestris&#34;
* **Role:** Melee Combat Specialist
* **Real Name:** Cassie Ionia
* **Age:** 28
* **Preferred weapons:** Shield and Spear
* **Special provisions:** A-04&#39;s chassis is to be installed with a killswitch that can be activated by Researcher Johnston or Squad Leader Cassington. On activation their chassis will turn off, rendering them immobile.

**Description:** A-04 was originally a Valkyrie of Valravn Corporation&#39;s greek branch. Her unit abandoned her after an operation and she was given asylum by the SCP Foundation in exchange for information regarding Valravn. There was also the added stipulation that she train our soldiers to counter Valravn in case the ceasefire ever fell through. Researcher Johnston was confident that A-04 would make a good candidate for Omega-45 due to her unique skillset and the regret she had for her actions at Valravn.

Before joining Valravn, A-04 was a member of the Greek military and lost both of her arms during a U.N peacekeeping mission. A-04 harbors a deep regret about this moment, reflecting that Valravn took advantage of her fragile mental state. She has stated during Psych Evals that she harbors vengeful feelings towards her squad leader that left her behind stating her conduct was &#34;Cowardly in the eyes of Ares.&#34;

A-04&#39;s body is crafted from state-of-the-art paratech, giving her abilities that far exceed the capabilities of a normal human. These augmentations are a boon in battle but A-04 chooses to eschew her in-built weaponry, finding it more honorable to engage with classic Greek weaponry.

A-04 is boisterous and proud, constantly boasting about her Greek heritage and the gods that have blessed her in combat. In addition, she appears to have adopted the Spartan&#39;s famous Laconic wit, often replying in short sarcastic remarks.
