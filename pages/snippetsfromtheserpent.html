-&gt;&gt; You joined channel #booksudontread
-&gt;&gt; Topic is: Welcome to #booksudontread - RULES: Don&#39;t be an ass. Don&#39;t out your fellows. If you&#39;re here, it&#39;s because you&#39;ve been invited. If you get kicked, it&#39;s because the ops think you&#39;ve been doing something that could endanger yourself or others. Don&#39;t come back without their approval.
-&gt;&gt; Topic set by MisterKitty on 1/23/2013 12:33:27 PM
**@@* ChanServ sets mode +v no1uno for #booksudontread@@**
&lt;@MisterKitty&gt; So he says, &#39;First assume a spherical Chicken!&#39;
&lt;Vet&gt; Hahahaahhahahahahaha
&lt;vodkanono&gt; lol
&lt;crankshaft&gt; hehehe
&lt;~3rdSister&gt; Oh lordy Mid, that&#39;s an old one.
&lt;@MisterKitty&gt; Still good.
&lt;no1uno&gt; Sounds like a good time being had.
**@@* Jagerman rolls some dice, and opens up a door.@@**
&lt;no1uno&gt; It&#39;s nice you all can laugh at a time like this. When things are so rough.
&lt;romeoohromeo&gt; whaddya mean no1?
&lt;@MisterKitty&gt; I haven&#39;t seen you around before, no1uno. When did you join?
&lt;Vet&gt; Ha, new blood! Let&#39;s ask him the questions!
&lt;@MisterKitty&gt; Oh lord, do we have to go through with this?
&lt;vodkanono&gt; Why not? There are traditions that keep us strong. We shall continue. 
&lt;no1uno&gt; If this is how things are done, then let them continue as such.
&lt;@MisterKitty&gt; Fine, go ahead, ask the damn questions already.
&lt;romeoohromeo&gt; al right, question one: how&#39;d ya find us?
&lt;no1uno&gt; Oh, I have my ways.
&lt;crayweed&gt; Oh no! That&#39;s a cop out! Come on, we&#39;ve all done the questions, you gotta answer.
&lt;no1uno&gt; Well, to be prefectly honest, I just typed in &#39;Serpent Hands Secret Chat room&#39; and this is what popped up.
&lt;romeoohromeo&gt; ...
&lt;crayweed&gt; ...
&lt;Vet&gt; ...
&lt;romeoohromeo&gt; i don&#39;t believe you
&lt;no1uno&gt; To be fair, I&#39;m not actually using a regular computer. I had this one special built to do most of the work of tracking you people down. You&#39;re almost as hard to find as I am. But now I have you.
&lt;destructiveMouse&gt; ...
&lt;crankshaft&gt; ...
&lt;~3rdSister&gt; ... Okay, let&#39;s get this joker out of here.
-&gt;&gt; You were kicked from #booksudontread by 3rdSister (Bork@borkdeborkbork) Reason (You were not invited.)
&lt;no1uno&gt; and Yet, I am still here.
&lt;romeoohromeo&gt; is... is that supposed to be possible? c, i thought you had this on lock down.
&lt;~3rdSister&gt; That shouldn&#39;t be possible. But hanging aroudn you guys I know possible is a big field. You kids talk to him, I&#39;m gonna... work my magic.
&lt;no1uno&gt; I believe there was a second question?
&lt;crayweed&gt; Okay, right, I got this. What are you lookign for here?
&lt;no1uno&gt; Succor. Release. I seek the one who will free me from my torment, and let me once more pass on to the next. I seek the knowledge of the past, and the wisdom of the future.
&lt;vodkanono&gt; ...
&lt;@MisterKitty&gt; ...
&lt;romeoohromeo&gt; ... the fuck, man?
&lt;~3rdSister&gt; Got you now! Suck it asshole.
**@@* 3rdSister sets mode +b *!*@no1uno for#booksudontread@@**
&lt;~3rdSister&gt; Wait, what? That wasn&#39;t a name ban... Fuck it.
 -&gt;&gt; You were kicked from #booksudontread by 3rdSister (Bork@borkdeborkbork) Reason (Eat it creep.)
**@@* 3rdSister wipes her hands of it. &#34;Asshole dealt with.&#34;@@**
&lt;vodkanono&gt; *Applauds* Well played, oh web mistress of awesome.
&lt;no1uno&gt; I believe such applauds would be out of line, as I am still here.
&lt;~3rdSister&gt; MOTHER FUCKER! Give me a moment.
**@@* 3rdSister (Bork@borkdeborkbork) has left #bookudontread ()@@**
&lt;Vet&gt; All right asshole, as long as we&#39;ve got you here, let&#39;s finish this. Last question. What&#39;s your power?&#34;
&lt;@MisterKitty&gt; Don&#39;t feed the noobs guys.
&lt;crayweed&gt; Well, you gonna answer or what
&lt;no1uno&gt; Ah, now you come to the crux of this operation, the nub, the epitome of what I wish to speak on.You see, I am unknown, I am unseen, I am not. Those who are aware do not believe, and I, I sit in the cracks, and watch the world turn. And I am here with an offer.
&lt;@MisterKitty&gt; What do you offer us?
&lt;no1uno&gt; You? Absolutely nothing. You have the power you seek.
&lt;romeoohromeo&gt; aw yeah, romeo is coming into power now give it to me bitches
&lt;no1uno&gt; Let us say no.
&lt;crayweed&gt; Then why ARE you here?
**@@* vodkanono checks his watch.@@**
&lt;vodkanono&gt; Why must the evil villains go on and on and on and on..
&lt;no1uno&gt; I resist the label of evil.
&lt;crankshaft&gt; So you&#39;re a good guy?
&lt;romeoohromeo&gt; he reisists the label of good
&lt;no1uno&gt; I resist the label of... yes.
&lt;crayweed&gt; So your nothing.
&lt;no1uno&gt; I am me, is that not enough?
**@@* 3rdSister (Bork@borkdeborkbork) has joined #booksudontread@@**
&lt;no1uno&gt; And my target returns.
&lt;~3rdSister&gt; Right, you want me? Fine. Let&#39;s do this.
&lt;@MisterKitty&gt; C, are you sure you want to do this?
**@@* 3rdSister sets mode +i for #booksudontread@@**
**@@* romeoohromeo was kicked by 3rdSister (bork@borkdeborkbork) Reason (Personal Safety. Get the Docents.)@@**
**@@* crayweed was kicked by 3rdSister (bork@borkdeborkbork) Reason (Personal Safety. Get the Docents.)@@**
**@@* crankshaft was kicked by 3rdSister (bork@borkdeborkbork) Reason (Personal Safety. Get the Docents.)@@**
**@@* Jagerman was kicked by 3rdSister (bork@borkdeborkbork) Reason (Personal Safety. Get the Docents.)@@**
&lt;@Misterkitty&gt; Claire, no, let me stick around and help you!
**@@* Misterkitty was kicked by 3rdSister (bork@borkdeborkbork) Reason (Love you too. I&#39;ll deal with it.)@@**
**@@* vodkanono was kicked by 3rdSister (bork@borkdeborkbork) Reason (Personal Safety.)@@**
**@@* Vet was kicked by 3rdSister (bork@borkdeborkbork) Reason (Personal Safety.)@@**
**@@* destructiveMouse was kicked by 3rdSister (bork@borkdeborkbork) Reason (Personal Safety.)@@**
**@@* OldMan was kicked by 3rdSister (bork@borkdeborkbork) Reason (When the hell did you get here?)@@**
&lt;~3rdSister&gt; And now it is down to me, and it is down to you.
&lt;no1uno&gt; It has always been thus. You just resisted it. There&#39;s still one person watching, you know.
&lt;~3rdSister&gt; I have no idea what the fuck you&#39;re talking about. There&#39;s no one else in the room! How did you bypass my security? Why are you cracking my site? What the fuck do you want from me?
&lt;no1uno&gt; I want to make you an offer. I&#39;m tired. I&#39;ve been doing this for... for too long. It has taken a  toll on my mind as well as my body.
&lt;~3rdSister&gt; What makes you think I want it? 
&lt;no1uno&gt; Because you asked for it, Claire. Because you want to be the ultimate thorn in the side of the Jailers.
&lt;~3rdSister&gt; ...
&lt;~3rdSister&gt; ... Oh.
&lt;~3rdSister&gt; You.
&lt;no1uno&gt; Me.
&lt;~3rdSister&gt; What do you offer?
&lt;no1uno&gt; Everything. All my files, all my tools, everything you need to make them fail.
&lt;~3rdSister&gt; And what does it cost?
&lt;no1uno&gt; Everything. You will be unable to make yourself known, even to those who were your closest friends. You will be me. Will have always been me.
&lt;~3rdSister&gt; My...family?
&lt;no1uno&gt; Will never have had a third little sister.
&lt;~3rdSister&gt; Never again...
&lt;no1uno&gt; But you&#39;d fulfill the family goal.
&lt;~3rdSister&gt; You&#39;re an asshole. Very well. I accept.
&lt;no1uno&gt; Turn around.
