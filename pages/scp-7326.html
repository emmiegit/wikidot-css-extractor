**Item-#:** 7326

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Two security cameras are to monitor the interior and exterior of &#34;Dave&#39;s Catering&#34;. A personal assistant is to be assigned to PoI-7326 to aid him in managing his business, while reinforcing the &#34;Advertising Gimmick&#34; cover story.

**Description:** SCP-7326 denotes instances of otherwise conventional store display mannequins with the ability to produce and expel smoke from a &#34;mouth&#34; cavity within their heads. This has been observed to occur in clustered emanation events where the instance will rapidly produce and expel a small quantity of smoke, wait a short period of time, and then repeat that process for 5-15 minutes. 

**Discovery:** Foundation personnel became aware of potential anomalous activity after a series of safety inspections at &#34;Dave&#39;s Catering&#34; identified, but could not find the source of, the smell of burning plastic in and around the storefront. Agent Mercator was sent to interview the owner David Fisher, denoted as PoI-7326, and locate any anomalous phenomena. Their interaction has been transcribed below.

**Interviewed:** PoI-7326

**Interviewer:** Agent Mercator

----

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

//Agent Mercator&#39;s body camera turns on to reveal the door to &#34;Dave&#39;s Catering&#34;. After adjusting the camera for a moment, he enters.//

//Mercator gags.//

**Mercator:** Eugh... definitely plastic.

//Mercator walks to the center of the store and pans around. The camera jumps.//

**Mercator:** Shit!

//The camera turns to face a pair of mannequins.//

**Mercator:** Fucking dolls...

(3 minutes of basic investigation removed)

//A door behind the counter is heard to unlock, and then creaks open. PoI-7326 walks through, but does not seem to notice Mercator.//

**Mercator:** Hello, Sir?

//PoI-7326 freezes.//

**PoI-7326:** Who&#39;s there?

//PoI-7326 finds a knife on the countertop and brandishes it in the direction of Mercator.//

**Mercator:** Woah! I can come back another time if you aren&#39;t open!

//PoI-7326 rubs his eye, then squints in the direction of a clock.//

**PoI-7326:** Eh? Shit...

//PoI-7326 drops the knife back on the countertop.//

**PoI-7326:** So what can I do ye for lad?

//Mercator takes a moment to regain his composure.//

**Mercator:** Are you David? David Fisher?

//PoI-7326 narrows his eyes at Mercator.//

**PoI-7326:** Who&#39;s asking?

//PoI-7326 grabs the knife again.//

**PoI-7326:** If you&#39;re with those //hounds// trying to shut down my business you&#39;ll have another thing coming for you!

//Mercator backs away.//

**Mercator:** Sir. Sir! I&#39;m an independent investigator! I was told about a &#34;plastic smell&#34; you couldn&#39;t find the source of.

//PoI-7326 drops the knife.//

**PoI-7326:** That? I&#39;ve heard about it but I can&#39;t smell it myself.

**Mercator:** No?

**PoI-7326:** Haven&#39;t smelt a thing since the 70&#39;s.

**Mercator:** Right... And you own a catering business?

//PoI-7326 looks blankly at Mercator for a few seconds.//

**PoI-7326:** I&#39;ve got the lads to help run things...

//PoI-7326 motions to the mannequins.//

**PoI-7326:** Not that they do anything other than smoke!

//Mercator turns, a cigarette can be seen in one of the mannequin&#39;s hands. He lets out a slight chuckle before turning back to PoI-7326.//

**Mercator:** Yes... So those two are your only employees?

//PoI-7326 smiles and nods, then lowers his voice.//

**PoI-7326:** Bit dull in their heads, the both of them, but they&#39;re good lads.

**Mercator:** Mhm?

**PoI-7326:** Good lads... What were you on about again?

**Mercator:** The plastic smell, Sir.

**PoI-7326:** Eh... Not the foggiest...

//PoI-7326 looks past Mercator, then shouts.//

**PoI-7326:** Fucking hell Bob!

//Mercator turns to reveal a trail of smoke coming from one of the mannequin&#39;s mouths.//

**Mercator:** What? Mr. Fish- eugh.

//Mercator gags. PoI-7326 rushes around the counter toward the two mannequins.//

**PoI-7326:** Every day it&#39;s the same with you two!

//PoI-7326 begins pushing the mannequins toward and out the front door.//

**PoI-7326:** Take it outside!

//Mercator watches as PoI-7326 situates the two mannequins outside. They can be seen &#34;smoking&#34; through the window. PoI-7326 returns, and sighs.//

**PoI-7326:** The two are idiots, don&#39;t mind them. What were we talking about?

**Mercator:** Uh... I think I&#39;ve actually got what I need.

**PoI-7326:** Yeah? Good for you.

**Mercator:** Thank you for your time, Sir.

**PoI-7326:** It&#39;s nothing, you seem like a good lad.

//Mercator stops his body camera.//

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

Following the above interview, due to the plausibility of SCP-7326&#39;s effects as an advertising gimmick, two surveillance cameras were set up to monitor the interior and exterior of &#34;Dave&#39;s Catering&#34; for any unusual occurrences. No further containment measures were taken.

**Incident 7326.1:** PoI-7326 entered into an altercation with a customer, culminating in the removal of one of the arms of SCP-7326-2 (&#34;Steve&#34;). The following interview occurred when Agent Mercator arrived at the scene shortly after the event took place. 

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

//The body camera turns on to reveal the door to &#34;Dave&#39;s Catering&#34;. As Mercator enters, smoke rolls out from the top of the doorframe.//

**Mercator:** Mr. Fisher!

//The camera pans across the room before stopping at the counter. As Mercator approaches, PoI-7326 is revealed kneeling on the ground, struggling to use his shaking hands to search the cabinet.//

**Mercator:** Mr. Fisher? What happened?

//PoI-7326 looks up at Mercator.//

**PoI-7326:** Who&#39;s th-

//PoI-7326 breaks into a coughing fit.//

**Mercator:** Let&#39;s go outside first, alright?

//PoI-7326 nods and Mercator crouches down to help him up. As they begin to move, PoI-7326 stops to speak, voice hoarse.//

**PoI-7326:** Bring the lads outside too... They shouldn&#39;t be smoking in the shop.

//Mercator turns, focusing the camera on SCP-7326-2, who can be seen letting out a constant stream of smoke from its mouth.//

**Mercator:** I can do that sir, but we need to get you out of this smoke.

//Mercator leads PoI-7326 outside, helping him lean up against the wall. He then retrieves the SCP-7326 instances, before returning to PoI-7326.//

**Mercator:** Can you tell me what happened, Sir?

//PoI-7326 takes a deep breath.//

**PoI-7326:** Some kid... Don&#39;t know who... Came shouting about Bob and Steve.

//PoI-7326 coughs.//

**PoI-7326:** Said they were dummies... told me they didn&#39;t do anything...

//PoI-7326 coughs.//

**PoI-7326:** And I know the two are a bit dull... but I wont let some kid call them &#34;stupid&#34;!

**PoI-7326:** So I went up to the kid and told &#39;em just what... told &#39;em to fuck right off I did!

**PoI-7326:** But he didn&#39;t leave... went right up to Steve and...

//PoI-7326 pauses.//

**Mercator:** And what, Sir?

**PoI-7326:** Tore the poor lad&#39;s arm off.

//PoI-7326&#39;s voice starts to break.//

**PoI-7326:** So I start to get real mad at this kid, shouting at em, he&#39;s shouting at me, and I...

**PoI-7326:** He didn&#39;t deserve it... he&#39;s a good lad...

//PoI-7326 starts crying.//

**PoI-7326:** It&#39;s bad enough Bob got &#39;im on smoke... he&#39;s got a lotta life left to live...

//PoI-7326 takes a sharp inhale through his nose.//

**PoI-7326:** He&#39;s a good lad...

//PoI-7326 takes a moment to collect himself.//

**PoI-7326:** So I punched the sorry kid in the face and he ran away.

**Mercator:** Serves him right, eh.

**PoI-7326:** Fuckin kids.

//The two are silent for a few seconds.//

**Mercator:** Do you need me to get you anything, Sir?

//PoI-7326 pauses for a moment, and looks at Bob and Steve.//

**PoI-7326:** No... Not at all, sonny. Long as these two are alright I&#39;ll be alright too.

**Mercator:** Well. Why don&#39;t I give you my phone number, so you can call me if anything happens?

//PoI-7326 is silent for a moment.//

**PoI-7326:** Yeah... That would be good.

**Mercator:** Wonderful.

//Mercator stops his body camera.//

**&lt;End Log&gt;**
[[/div]]

To prevent further incidents, Agent Mercator has been allowed to use &#34;Dave&#39;s Catering&#34; as a base of operations, acting as PoI-7326&#39;s personal assistant in addition to his regular duties.

The perpetrator of SCP-7326-2&#39;s assault remains unknown.

**Incident 7326.2:** The following incident occurred shortly after PoI-7326 relocated both SCP-7326 instances outside for their &#34;Smoke Break&#34;.  Agent Mercator notes he was preoccupied when the event began, and was unable to witness its cause.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
= **Incident Log 7326.2**
----

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

//The body camera turns on to Mercator rapidly descending the stairwell inside of &#34;Dave&#39;s Catering&#34;. PoI-7326&#39;s muffled voice can be heard.//

**PoI-7326:** Carl! (inaudible) -Carl!

//Mercator runs through the storefront and out the front door.//

**Mercator:** Dave?!

//Mercator turns to face PoI-7326, who is kneeling in front of a prone SCP-7326-1 while administering chest compressions.//

**Mercator:** Shit- What happened?

//PoI-7326 turns to Mercator, his eyes are frantic.//

**PoI-7326:** Told the dolt to cut the smoke, but he never listened. Steve&#39;s done his best but...

//PoI-7326 returns his focus to SCP-7326-1.//

**PoI-7326:** The lad&#39;s just got one arm, Carl.

**Mercator:** What should I-

**PoI-7326:** Get Steve inside!

**Mercator:** But-

**PoI-7326:** He doesn&#39;t need to see this.

**Mercator:** Sir-

**PoI-7326:** Go.

//Mercator turns to face SCP-7326-2, looming over its coworkers and letting out a trail of smoke from its mouth.//

//He stands frozen for a few moments.//

**PoI-7326:** Go!

//Mercator grabs the mannequin and wheels it inside.//

//The room is silent.//

//The camera turns towards the window, where PoI-7326 can be seen still administering CPR.//

//Mercator sighs, then looks back toward SCP-7326-2.//

**Mercator:** You did what you could, Steve...

//He turns the mannequin away from the window, then stops his body camera.//

**&lt;End Log&gt;**
[[/div]]

While the cause of the collapse was initially unknown, observation of the remains by Agent Mercator revealed that the interior of SCP-7326-1&#39;s form had been entirely burnt away, ruining its structural integrity.

Agent Mercator reported that PoI-7326 believes SCP-7326-2 is suffering from guilt due to its inability to aid SCP-7326-1 when it collapsed.

**Incident 7326.3:** A week after Incident 7326.2, PoI-7326 was observed walking SCP-7326-2 away from the premises of &#34;Dave&#39;s Catering&#34;. When Agent Mercator moved to intervene, it was discovered that they were visiting the local cemetery to bury SCP-7326-1&#39;s remains.

Following Incident 7326.3, PoI-7326 has taken SCP-7326-2 on weekly visits to SCP-7326-1&#39;s grave. In addition to this, SCP-7326-2 has halted emanation events.
