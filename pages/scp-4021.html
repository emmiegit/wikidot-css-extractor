**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4021-1 has been incinerated and its containment chamber is to be used for other projects in the future. Its ashes are stored in an urn[[footnote]] As per request from Dr. Trent Carter, a senior researcher assisting in prior containment of SCP-4021. [[/footnote]] kept in Dr. Carter&#39;s office.
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ (06/19/15) Archived Containment Procedures [INPUT LEVEL 2 CREDENTIALS]&#34; hide=&#34;- (06/19/15) Archived Containment Procedures [INPUT LEVEL 2 CREDENTIALS]&#34;]] SCP-4021 is to be contained in a Size-1 [[footnote]] 9m x 12m x 12m. [[/footnote]] Anomaly greenhouse with multiple growing beds for use by SCP-4021-2. SCP-4021-1 requires at least 7 hours of artificial or natural sunlight per day, and is to be misted daily with fresh distilled water for one hour. Personnel with Level-1 clearance or higher are permitted to interact with SCP-4021-2 and the crops they tend. Assorted fruit seeds are to be provided to SCP-4021-2 in order to keep instances content.  Dr. Alan Phid has been chosen as the Project Head of containment and research for SCP-4021. --Any requests for changes to containment procedures MUST be submitted to the Project Head.--

//I&#39;m not taking anymore of your ideas. Go yell at a wall, it might be more receptive to it then I am.// -Project Head

&gt;
--On 05/03/15, propositions for revised containment have been suggested by Senior Researcher Carter due to changes in behavior.-- Denied by project head on 5/06/15 for &#34;unnecessary changes.&#34;

**Description:** SCP-4021 is the incinerated remains of a mandarin orange tree, referred to as SCP-4021-1. SCP-4021-1 previously produced sentient humanoid fruits referred to as SCP-4021-2.
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ (06/19/15) Archived Description [INPUT LEVEL 2 CREDENTIALS]&#34; hide=&#34;- (06/19/15) Archived Description [INPUT LEVEL 2 CREDENTIALS]&#34;]]SCP-4021-1 is a 7m tall mandarin orange (//Citrus reticulata//) tree. Instances of SCP-4021-2 have been observed religiously worshiping this tree, possibly considering it as a deity. SCP-4021-1 requires a large amount of [REMOVED] to continually produce SCP-4021-2 instances and remain healthy.
&gt;
//Don&#39;t ask what was removed, it&#39;s not important.// -Project Head

SCP-4021-2 instances are gradually produced at a varying time frame from SCP-4021-1. SCP-4021-2 are sapient mandarin fruits with limbs that appear to be made of material analogous to non-anomalous plant stalk matter, with a series of interior organs that function similarly to those found in humans. SCP-4021-2 have been found to have a sense of sight, taste, and hearing, however it is unknown if they have a sense of smell and touch. SCP-4021-2 are able to engage in communication through mouth-like structures. These structures seem to have an organ within resembling a human tongue. The language that SCP-4021-2 instances speak is unknown. SCP-4021-2 are typically docile, and seem to enjoy conversation amongst other SCP-4021-2 instances. When SCP-4021-2 instances are not tending to their crops, they are seen conversing with each other or --staring outside of the containment area for long periods of time.--[[footnote]]Was not occurring until 3 months in containment.[[/footnote]]

While there are 17 SCP-4021-2 instances in existence, SCP-4021-1 appears to cease producing fruit until an SCP-4021-2 instance has expired. It also requires for the remaining SCP-4021-2 instances have completed their burial ritual, and that sufficient time has transpired for the buried instance to have completely rotted, typically 6-7 weeks. When an instance of SCP-4021-2 expires, the other instances of SCP-4021-2 will pick up the dead specimen and bury it under SCP-4021-1. SCP-4021-2 pray daily at dawn, and during births of SCP-4021-2 instances in groups of 3-4 instances. The frequency of these praying rituals have been observed to be gradually increasing over time, sometimes straying from the common times when they pray. --Additional writing on the ground in their language has been observed multiple times following these rituals.--

--When initially contained, the maximum population of SCP-4021-2 instances alive at one time dropped from 73 to 17, as evident from photograph taken at SCP-4021&#39;s initial retrieval site. The cause for this is unknown.--

//Why are you adding unnecessary things to the document? It&#39;s supposed to stay like how it is.// -Project Head

SCP-4021-2 instances have shown a significant interest in gardening, having been observed tending to all fruit crops in their containment cell. It should be noted that crops that are not classified as fruit were ignored by SCP-4021-2. The harvested crops have been tested by Foundation personnel and have shown no anomalous effects. --When crops are ready to be harvested, SCP-4021-2 instances will allow personnel to take as many as they want, provided that the fruit taken is not part of the orange family.-- 

//Nobody gets any anymore.// -Project Head

&gt; 
**Addendum SCP-4021-01:** A series of tests with SCP-4021-2 instances. all proposed by the Project Head, occurred to test their reactions to various objects.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ (05/26/15) Addendum SCP-4021-01 Test Log [INPUT LEVEL 2 CREDENTIALS]&#34; hide=&#34;- (05/26/15) Addendum SCP-4021-01 Test Log [INPUT LEVEL 2 CREDENTIALS]&#34;]]
||~ Test # ||~ Specimen ||~ Results ||
|| Test 1 || One packet of commercially acquired bitter orange (//Citrus aurantium//) plant seeds. || SCP-4021-2 planted the seeds and proceeded to carefully tend the crop. SCP-4021-2 instances were observed attempting to converse with the crop in the same mannerisms they show when conversing with other instances. ||
|| Test 2 || One live marsh rabbit. (//Sylvilagus palustris//) and one metal cage (empty) || SCP-4021-2 instances attempted to capture the rabbit, taking around 30 minutes to contain it within the metal cage. SCP-4021-2 then returned to tending their crops and the rabbit was thereafter ignored before being taken out by research personnel. || 
|| Test 3 || One glass of commercially acquired orange juice. || The SCP-4021-2 instances immediately began exhibiting signs of extreme distress at the sight of the juice. Following shortly after, the instances of SCP-4021-2 nearby proceeded to [REMOVED] || 
|| Test 4 || Two ladybird beetles. (//Coccinella septempunctata//) ||  SCP-4021-2 instances proceeded exhibiting signs of pleasure when they first noticed the beetles in containment. They began to watch as the beetles moved around their containment and analyze their behaviors. ||
|| Test 5 || One leaf picked from SCP-4021-1. || [REMOVED] ||
|| Test 6 || One decapitated instance of SCP-4021-2 || [REMOVED] ||

//Don&#39;t ask me what they used to say before removal. I&#39;m tired of getting asked. I had my reasons. So please, stop asking. Things like these are why I swear I&#39;m going fucking insane working here with you people.// -SCP-4021 Project Head
[[/collapsible]]
&gt; 
**Addendum SCP-4021-02:** Changes in behavior of SCP-4021 have resulted in the requirement to take notes of any changes in behavior. These notes are overseen by the Project Head.
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ (05/26/15) Addendum SCP-4021-02 Behavioral Notes [INPUT LEVEL 2 CREDENTIALS]&#34; hide=&#34;- (05/26/15) Addendum SCP-4021-02 Behavioral Notes [INPUT LEVEL 2 CREDENTIALS]&#34;]]
**Behavioral note dated 04/22/15:** Proportionally less conversation and overall activity has been noticed between the SCP-4021-2 instances. It has also been noticed that SCP-4021-2 have not been tending to the crops within their containment chamber as often as usual. 

//Who cares anymore? Why should we care anymore?// -Project Head

**Behavioral note dated 05/03/15:** The population of SCP-4021-2 instances has decreased to 13, despite sufficient time having elapsed for SCP-4021-1 to produce further &#34;offspring&#34;. The cause for this is currently unknown.

//[REMOVED]// -Project Head

**Behavioral note dated 05/28/15:** SCP-4021-2 instances have been observed spending a significantly increased amount of time near the entrance to the containment area. Furthermore, the observed instances have begun taking on a more &#34;wilted&#34; appearance than previously noted. No signs of disease found.

**Behavioral note dated 06/19/15:** The population of SCP-4021-2 instances has again decreased to 9. A request is to be submitted for an eventual reclassification to Neutralized if trends have been observed to continue.

//It&#39;s nothing to worry about...// -Project Head

**Behavioral note dated 09/20/15:** Over the past few months following the previous note, the amount of instances of SCP-4021-2 active at one time has decreased until none have been produced at all for extended periods of time. SCP-4021-1 has &#34;died,&#34; its features consistent with decomposition. SCP-4021-1 incinerated, and SCP-4021 reclassified to Neutralized.

//I&#39;m screwed.// -Project Head
[[/collapsible]]
**Addendum SCP-4021-03:** On 08/17/15, Project Head left a note on the document directed at the researchers assisting in containment of SCP-4021.
&gt;
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ (08/17/15) Addendum SCP-4021-03 Note Archival [INPUT LEVEL 2 CREDENTIALS]&#34; hide=&#34;- (08/17/15) Addendum SCP-4021-03 Note Archival [INPUT LEVEL 2 CREDENTIALS]&#34;]]
**A Warning:** Consider this a warning so I can have some peace of mind: Stop messing with the document. Leave it as-is. Only I have full authorization to put any messages anywhere on this document. 

//[REMOVED]// -Senior Researcher Trent Carter

//I can use this document however the hell I want to.// -Project Head
[[/collapsible]]
&gt;
**Addendum SCP-4021-04:** Project Head Alan Phid has been reported by several personnel to recently have shown disorderly behavior, and being increasingly aggressive to both Foundation personnel and remaining SCP-4021-2 instances. Dr. Phid was brought in for psychiatric screening,[[footnote]]Dr. Phid has been confirmed as a schizophrenic on 9/14/15.[[/footnote]] and is now being observed by on-site psychiatrists.

**Addendum SCP-4021-05:** On 09/20/15, SCP-4021 Project Head Alan Phid was found dead in his office after shooting himself in the head. A hand-written note by Alan Phid was also recovered.
&gt;
&#34;Alan Phid&#34; was later found to be an alias he had adopted. Further research into his background is ongoing.

&gt; I ruined my own life and theirs by working here. I tortured them. I can&#39;t live with what I&#39;ve done. This is goodbye.

//Looking back on this now, I should have realized this guy had a few screws loose.// -Senior Researcher Trent Carter
[[/collapsible]]

**Addendum SCP-4021-06:** On 9/23/15, seeds from remaining fruit of SCP-4021-1 have been extracted. Possible revival of this SCP is currently being researched.
