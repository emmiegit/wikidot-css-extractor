**Item #:** SCP-4021
&gt;
**Object Class:** Neutralized
&gt;
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4021-1 has been incinerated and its containment chamber is to be used for other projects in the future. Most of its ashes have been discarded, save for a small amount which is stored in an urn kept in Dr. Carter&#39;s office.[[footnote]] As per request from Dr. Carter.[[/footnote]]
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ (09/20/15) Archived Containment Procedures [INPUT LEVEL 2 CREDENTIALS]&#34; hide=&#34;- (09/20/15) Archived Containment Procedures [INPUT LEVEL 2 CREDENTIALS]&#34;]] SCP-4021 is to be contained in a Size-1 [[footnote]] 9m x 12m x 12m. [[/footnote]] Anomaly greenhouse with multiple growing beds for use by SCP-4021-2. SCP-4021-1 requires at least 7 hours of artificial or natural sunlight per day, and is to be misted daily with fresh distilled water for one hour. Personnel with Level-1 clearance or higher are permitted to interact with SCP-4021-2 and the crops they tend. Assorted fruit seeds are to be provided to SCP-4021-2 in order to keep instances content. Dr. Phid has been chosen as the Project Head of containment and research for SCP-4021. Any requests for changes to containment procedures must be submitted to the Project Head.
&gt;
On 05/03/15, propositions for revised containment including an expanded living space and more frequent surveillance have been suggested by Dr. Carter due to changes in SCP-4021&#39;s behavior. On 05/06/15, the proposition was denied by the Project Head for unnecessary changes.

**Description:** SCP-4021 is the designation given to both SCP-4021-1, which is the incinerated remains of a mandarin orange tree, and SCP-4021-2, which were sentient humanoid fruits that were previously produced periodically by SCP-4021-1.
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ (09/20/15) Archived Description [INPUT LEVEL 2 CREDENTIALS]&#34; hide=&#34;- (09/20/15) Archived Description [INPUT LEVEL 2 CREDENTIALS]&#34;]]SCP-4021-1 is a 7m tall mandarin orange (//Citrus reticulata//) tree. Instances of SCP-4021-2 religiously worship this tree, possibly considering it as a deity. SCP-4021-1 requires a large amount of [REDACTED] to continually produce SCP-4021-2 instances and remain healthy.

SCP-4021-2 instances are gradually produced at a varying time frame from SCP-4021-1. SCP-4021-2 are sapient mandarin fruits with limbs that appear to be made of material analogous to non-anomalous plant stalk matter, with a series of interior organs that function similarly to those found in humans. SCP-4021-2 have been found to have a sense of sight, taste, and hearing; it is unknown if they have a sense of smell and touch. SCP-4021-2 are able to engage in communication through mouth-like structures. However, the language that SCP-4021-2 instances communicate in is unknown. SCP-4021-2 are docile in nature, and seem to enjoy conversation amongst other SCP-4021-2 instances. When SCP-4021-2 instances are not tending to their crops, they are typically seen conversing with each other --or staring outside of the containment area for long periods of time.--[[footnote]]This was not occurring until SCP-4021 had spent 3 months in containment.[[/footnote]]

While there are 17[[footnote]]When initially contained, the maximum population of SCP-4021-2 instances alive at one time dropped from 73 to 17, as evident from photographs taken at SCP-4021&#39;s initial retrieval site.[[/footnote]] SCP-4021-2 instances in existence, SCP-4021-1 appears to cease producing fruit until an SCP-4021-2 instance has expired; it also requires for the remaining SCP-4021-2 instances to have completed their burial ritual, and that sufficient time has transpired for the buried instance to have completely decomposed, typically taking up to 7 weeks. When an instance of SCP-4021-2 expires, the other instances of SCP-4021-2 will pick up the dead specimen and bury it under SCP-4021-1. SCP-4021-2 &#34;pray&#34; daily at dawn, and during births of SCP-4021-2 instances in groups of 3-4. The frequency of these praying rituals has been observed to be gradually increasing over time, sometimes straying from SCP-4021-2&#39;s common praying routine patterns. --Additionally, writing on the ground from SCP-4021-2 instances in what is presumed to be their language has been found multiple times following these rituals.--

SCP-4021-2 instances have shown a significant interest in gardening, often tending to fruit crops in their containment chamber. It should be noted that crops not classified as fruit were ignored by SCP-4021-2. The harvested crops have been tested by Foundation personnel and have shown no anomalous effects. --When crops are ready to be harvested, SCP-4021-2 instances will allow personnel to take as many as they want, provided that the fruit taken is not part of the citrus genus.--

**Addendum SCP-4021-01:** A series of 6 tests with SCP-4021-2 instances was held. All of these tests were proposed by the Project Head to learn of their reactions to various objects and animals.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ (04/16/15) Addendum SCP-4021-01 Test Log [INPUT LEVEL 2 CREDENTIALS]&#34; hide=&#34;- (04/16/15) Addendum SCP-4021-01 Test Log [INPUT LEVEL 2 CREDENTIALS]&#34;]]
||~ Test # ||~ Specimen ||~ Results ||
|| Test 1 || One packet of commercially acquired bitter orange (//Citrus aurantium//) seeds. || SCP-4021-2 planted the seeds and proceeded to carefully tend the crop. SCP-4021-2 instances were observed attempting to converse with the crop in the same mannerisms they show when conversing with other instances. ||
|| Test 2 || One live marsh rabbit. (//Sylvilagus palustris//) and one metal cage (empty) || SCP-4021-2 instances attempted to capture the rabbit, taking around 30 minutes to contain it within the metal cage. SCP-4021-2 then returned to tending their crops and the rabbit was thereafter ignored before being taken out by research personnel. || 
|| Test 3 || One glass of commercially acquired orange juice. || The SCP-4021-2 instances immediately began exhibiting signs of extreme distress at the sight of the juice. Following shortly after, the instances of SCP-4021-2 nearby proceeded to [REDACTED] || 
|| Test 4 || Two ladybird beetles. (//Coccinella septempunctata//) ||  SCP-4021-2 instances proceeded exhibiting signs of pleasure when they first noticed the beetles in containment. They began to follow the beetles as they moved around their containment and analyzed their behaviors. ||
|| Test 5 || One leaf picked from SCP-4021-1. || [REDACTED] ||
|| Test 6 || One decapitated instance of SCP-4021-2 || [REDACTED] ||

**Addendum SCP-4021-02:** Changes in behavior of SCP-4021 have resulted in the requirement to consistently archive any further behavioral variations. 
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ (04/22/15) Addendum SCP-4021-02 Behavioral Notes [INPUT LEVEL 2 CREDENTIALS]&#34; hide=&#34;- (04/22/15) Addendum SCP-4021-02 Behavioral Notes [INPUT LEVEL 2 CREDENTIALS]&#34;]]
**Behavioral note dated 04/22/15:** Proportionally less conversation and overall activity has been observed between the SCP-4021-2 instances. It has also been noticed that SCP-4021-2 have not been tending to the crops within their containment chamber as often as usual. 

**Behavioral note dated 05/03/15:** The population of SCP-4021-2 instances has decreased to 13, despite sufficient time having elapsed for SCP-4021-1 to produce further offspring. Additionally, SCP-4021-2 instances have neglected their crops for several weeks, requiring personnel to maintain them instead.

**Behavioral note dated 05/28/15:** SCP-4021-2 instances seem to be spending a significantly increased amount of time near the entrances to the containment area. Furthermore, SCP-4021-2 instances have begun taking on a more wilted appearance than previously noted. No signs of any disease found.

**Behavioral note dated 06/19/15:** The population of SCP-4021-2 instances has again decreased to 9. SCP-4021-2 have been writing indecipherable symbols on a more common basis, often near any entrance.

**Behavioral note dated 09/20/15:** Over the past few months following the previous note, the number of instances of SCP-4021-2 active at one time has gradually decreased until none have been produced at all for extended periods of time. On 09/20/15, SCP-4021-1 has died, its features consistent with decomposition. SCP-4021-1 has been incinerated, and SCP-4021 reclassified to Neutralized along with a revision of its documents.

&gt;
**Addendum SCP-4021-03:** On 08/17/15, the Project Head left a note on the document directed at the researchers assisting in containment of SCP-4021.
&gt;

**Notice from Project Head Alan Phid:** I&#39;ve gone through this document and crossed off unimportant parts. In the future, please refrain from including unnecessary information as it makes the document less easily accessible. I&#39;ve also received several questions as to what was removed from the document; everything that was removed was clutter, making it damn near unreadable. I will be taking no further questions regarding this matter.
[[/collapsible]]

**Addendum SCP-4021-04:** Dr. Phid has been reported missing since 09/20/15. On 09/22/15, Foundation investigators recovered a hand-written note in his office. The note reads as follows:
&gt; You are all so fucking stupid.

**Addendum SCP-4021-05:** After an investigation on the SCP-4021 Project Head, &#34;Alan Phid&#34; was later found to be an alias he had adopted. Further efforts to gain insight into his background are ongoing.

**Addendum SCP-4021-06:** On 09/23/15, seeds from remaining fruit of SCP-4021-1 have been extracted. Possible revival of this SCP is currently being researched.
