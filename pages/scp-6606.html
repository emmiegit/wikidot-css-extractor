[[tab C-M38735 &#34;SCP Article&#34; Voided Document 2]]

**Item #:** SCP-6606

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6606 cannot be contained.

**Description:** SCP-6606 refers to the worldwide governing body known as &#34;Spectrum,&#34; an agency whose leading figures and goals are unknown. 

While not necessarily the case, it is widely believed that Spectrum is the cause of a worldwide anomalous effect which forces all human individuals to complete any documentation when said documentation is detected by their main senses. When a stack of the same documentation type is detected, only one must be completed. When a document is complete, the affected human will return the document to a &#34;documentation acquisition receptacle.&#34; This is most-often defined as the area that the documentation was acquired from, although items such as mailboxes, mail deposit slots, bank capsule chutes, etc. have been known to satisfy this as well. Once a completed document is placed in a &#34;documentation acquisition receptacle,&#34; the document disappears. Where the document goes, if anywhere, is currently unknown. 

Spectrum has been known to implement global laws, the results of which require most, if not all citizens, to complete large amounts of documents. This is often to allow the citizen to acquire a certain kind of license, complete a certain census, apply for services of any sort, etc.

**Addendum 6606-1:** Notice on Front Door of Abandoned Facility

&gt; To whoever finds this note, I&#39;m sorry. We&#39;ve failed you. We tried to fight them as best as we could, but like they did to everyone else, they systematically tore us apart. Anything we tried to do, they had some sort of solution for. The last solution we have is to evacuate. We have managed to prevent a great number of things from taking humanity apart, but somehow, they managed to slip between our fingers and bite us. 
&gt; We have gathered a group comprised of people that we believe will allow us to start over elsewhere, wherever &#34;else&#34; may be. 
&gt; 
&gt; We don&#39;t know where we&#39;re going, only that, like cowards, we are going there.
&gt; 
&gt; -Dr. Patra, and what remains of Site-19.

**Addendum 6606-2:** Miscellaneous, Potentially-Related Documentation

&gt; **Lunar Site-32 Observatory Report:** June 23rd, 2023.
&gt; 
&gt; At 02:34 GMT, the Foundation Deep Space Telescope &#34;Osiris&#34; transmitted an image of the extrasolar planet &#34;Kepler-22b&#34; (//KOI-087.01//) as part of a routine bimonthly image capturing of terra analogues. As opposed to the planet&#39;s usual blue coloration due to it being an &#34;ocean planet&#34;, the planet possessed a green coloration with a large purple spot. Further image analysis showed the planet to be covered in the bodies of humanoid aquatic extraterrestrials, floating motionless on the planet&#39;s surface. A spacecraft can be seen rising from the mass of bodies, believed to be an escape vessel. The cause of this mass extinction event is unknown.

&gt; **Electronic Message Printout:** September 07th, 2024.
&gt; 
&gt; **To:** Site-17 Director █████, O5-Command
&gt; **From:** Site-19 Director ██████
&gt; 
&gt; **Body:** We&#39;ve not made a mistake. You need to remain immediately. Check your watch. The launch did go as planned, our coordinates were not changed and we are aiming at Spectrum.

&gt; **Electronic Message Printout:** September 07th, 2024.
&gt; 
&gt; **To:** Site-19 Director ██████, O5-Command
&gt; **From:** Site-17 Director █████
&gt; 
&gt; **Body:** You&#39;re fucking right, this was not a fucking mistake. We&#39;re evacuating. I don&#39;t know who you are, but I know for god damn sure that we would not destroy ourselves. You don&#39;t know what kind of ungodly terrors you&#39;ve unleashed. We&#39;re all doomed. Fuck you and your entire godforsaken species.

[[tab C-M38735 &#34;SCP Article&#34; Voided Document 3]]
**Item #:** SCP-6606

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6606 cannot be contained. Thusly, Foundation efforts should be focused on neutralization. At the time of writing, all attempts to neutralize SCP-6606 have failed.

**Description:** SCP-6606 refers to a large spacefaring vessel. The vessel is believed to be roughly 1/16th the size of the Earth, and remains in place roughly 175,000km above ocean level, within the planet&#39;s exosphere.

SCP-6606 is theorized to be the cause of a worldwide anomaly which affects all recorded documentation, as this anomaly only began following its arrival to earth&#39;s atmosphere. SCP-6606 is capable of changing any form of recorded information in any manner. SCP-6606 is capable of editing written documents, audio and video recordings, electronic text and messages, radio waves and frequencies, artistic depictions, photographs (both physical and digital), animated images, etc. Regardless of the quality of the editing, any human that perceives the edited information will treat it as though it were the original copy, and that the information, no matter how incorrect, illogical, or nonsensical it may be, is both factual, regular, and normal. 

The editing of recorded information is done instantaneously and can occur at any moment. It is believed that SCP-6606 is capable of perceiving any and all records and the information contained within at all times. SCP-6606 has used these abilities to manipulate vital, sometimes confidential and/or classified information from the ranks of all major world governments and organizations, including the SCP Foundation. This has lead to the collapse of most, if not all major governments, allowing itself to take their place and establish authority over humanity.

The entities that reside within SCP-6606, if any, are believed to be the cause of a worldwide psychological anomaly. Humans affected by said anomaly will experience an intense psychological effect which causes them to feel the urge to complete any unfinished documents which have yet to be completed when they become aware of said documents. When a stack of the same documentation type is detected by an infected individual, only one must be completed. Additionally, individuals will only experience this effect when the documentation appears to be directly intended for them to complete, or when the documentation does not appear to be directed at anyone in particular. 

When a document is complete, the affected human will return the document to a &#34;documentation acquisition receptacle.&#34; This is most-often defined as the area that the documentation was acquired from, although items such as mailboxes, mail deposit slots, bank capsule chutes, etc. have been known to satisfy this as well. Once a completed document is placed in a &#34;documentation acquisition receptacle,&#34; the document disappears. Where the document goes, if anywhere, is currently unknown.

SCP-6606&#39;s reason for causing this anomaly and method by which it is caused is unknown.

**Addendum 6606-1:** Notice on Front Door of Abandoned Facility

&gt; To whoever finds this note, I&#39;m sorry. We&#39;ve failed you. We tried to fight them as best as we could, but like they did to everyone else, they systematically tore us apart. Anything we tried to do, they had some sort of solution for. The last solution we have is to evacuate. We have managed to prevent a great number of things from taking humanity apart, but somehow, they managed to slip between our fingers and bite us. 
&gt; We have gathered a group comprised of people that we believe will allow us to start over elsewhere, wherever &#34;else&#34; may be. 
&gt; 
&gt; We don&#39;t know where we&#39;re going, only that, like cowards, we are going there.
&gt; 
&gt; -Dr. Patra, and what remains of Site-19.

**Addendum 6606-2:** 6/23/2023

&gt; **Lunar Site-32 Observatory Report:** June 23rd, 2023.
&gt; 
&gt; At 02:34 GMT, the Foundation Deep Space Telescope &#34;Osiris&#34; transmitted an image of the extrasolar planet &#34;Kepler-22b&#34; (//KOI-087.01//) as part of a routine bimonthly image capturing of terra analogues. As opposed to the planet&#39;s usual blue coloration due to it being an &#34;ocean planet&#34;, the planet possessed a green coloration with a large purple spot. Further image analysis showed the planet to be covered in the bodies of humanoid aquatic extraterrestrials, floating motionless on the planet&#39;s surface. A spacecraft can be seen rising from the mass of bodies, believed to be an escape vessel. The cause of this mass extinction event is unknown.
[[/div]]

&gt; **Lunar Site-32 Observatory Report:** June 24th, 2023.
&gt; 
&gt; At 16:11 GMT, researchers at the Site-32 Observatory noted that a large spacecraft of purple coloration entered direct observation range. Assuming the vessel is completely solid, it is estimated to be ~62,004,931,000km^3, roughly 1/16 the size of the planet Earth. At 23:42, the vessel came to rest in Earth&#39;s exosphere, ~175,000km above sea level. Due to the size of the vessel and the proximity of the vessel to the planet, it is believed to be visible from all locations on earth. Therefor, Site-32 recommends an operation normalizing government communication with extraterrestrials to ensure peace, or neutralizing the vessel ASAP.

**Addendum 6606-3:** 7/16/2023

&gt; **Operation Phone Home Daily Report:** July 16th, 2023
&gt; 
&gt; Attempts to establish radio communications with the vessel have officially failed. We have exhausted all possible radio/satellite communication methods. We will continue attempting various methods of communication. We are taking a break day tomorrow and then we will attempt to communicate via visual methods.
&gt; 
&gt; -Lunar Site-32

&gt; **Operation Phone Home Daily Report:** September 24th, 2023
&gt; 
&gt; Attempts to gain any attention from the vessel have failed. We have attempted to gain the vessel&#39;s interest via light redirection, audio disruptions, electromagnetic pulses, and various images, documents, and videos broadcasted onto the side of the vessel. We are suggesting the use of anomalous methods of gaining the attention of the vessel in order to establish communication. 
&gt; 
&gt; Additionally, it has been suggested by some staff members that there may not be any sentient lifeforms aboard the vessel, or that the vessel may not be hollow to begin with. 
&gt; 
&gt; We will await O5 approval for the use of anomalous communication methods.
&gt; -Lunar Site-32

&gt; **Operation Phone Home Daily Report:** May 2nd, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; Attempts to communicate with SCP-6606 through anomalous methods have officially failed. The use of safe and &#34;thaumiel&#34; class anomalies to communicate with SCP-6606 have all failed, and attempts to communicate with SCP-6606 via thaumaturgy and other magic-based methods have all failed. We recommend declaring communications with SCP-6606 to be a lost cause. As SCP-6606 has made no alterations to its state of being since its arrival, many on-site staff members believe SCP-6606 to be empty and/or pilotless. 
&gt; 
&gt; In the interest of precaution, we continue to recommend neutralizing SCP-6606 ASAP.

&gt; 
&gt; **ALERT: ALL FACILITIES. ENGAGE FACILITY LOCKDOWNS. UNKNOWN AIRBORNE PATHOGEN DETECTED. SEAL OFF INFECTED AREAS AND ENGAGE OXYGEN RECYCLING SYSTEMS.**

&gt; **Lunar Site-32 Emergency Message:** May 5th, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; At 12:36pm GMT, SCP-6606 was observed creating small ripples in its outer &#34;hull.&#34; Closer observation via high-power telescope shows that SCP-6606 may have produced something during this process. Keep your eyes peeled, home team. God knows what it just sent your way. 

&gt; **Area-12 Foundation-wide Broadcast:** May 6th, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; Our entire observation and containment wing has been contaminated. Most systems within are being operated by AI constructs or infected personnel. We&#39;ve sealed off a small section of the building, mostly the break room and some offices, and flooded an office with contaminated air for closer study. 
&gt; 
&gt; Whatever this is has almost certainly infected most of the public. There&#39;s a lot of it and it seems to infect humans quite quickly. Restrict outside travel unless deemed necessary. Use O2 tanks from your facility&#39;s recycler along with a rebreather when moving outdoors. 
&gt; 
&gt; Personnel are dropping off the Health Signifier, life signs aren&#39;t being returned and neither are their locations. Stay safe, stay alert, stay secure.

&gt; **Area-12 Foundation-wide Broadcast:** May 7th, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; A few microscopes in storage have been salvaged. We&#39;re attempting methods of containing the pathogen in a smaller, more easily-observable container. We&#39;d like to request a C4 Explosive Charge to be detonated at Facility Door 7. 

&gt; **Area-12 Foundation-wide Broadcast:** May 9th, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; What&#39;s left of us is huddled in the break room, or rather, the contained portions of it. We will be making no further requests. 
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Connors managed to slide a small dish of air contaminated with the pathogen through the air duct before the automatic seals dropped. He climbed into the vent and the door crushed his arm. Please remember him.

&gt; **Area-12 Foundation-wide Broadcast:** May 10th, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; It is not a pathogen, it is a machine. Hundreds of thousands of them, smaller than our eyes can see. None of us are robotics experts, but given that they have adamantly attempted to avoid observation, even within the dish, we believe that they are either:
&gt; 
&gt; A. Each controlled by their own AI.
&gt; 
&gt; B. Being controlled by something else.
&gt; 
&gt; C. Both
&gt; 
&gt; We&#39;re operating under assumption A, if only because we don&#39;t want to imagine the other two.

&gt; **Area-12 Foundation-wide Broadcast:** May 11th, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; There was a series of &#34;booms&#34; earlier today. The facility shook slightly but there was no major damage. Of note, however, is that we briefly lost connection to each of our Health Signifiers and Communication Bands. Dr. Brooks, who was contaminated in the &#34;Door 7 Mishap&#34; knocked on the door to the break room and held a note against the window of the door for us to read. &#34;Went to armory. EMPs didn&#39;t stop them.&#34;

&gt; **Area-12 Foundation-wide Broadcast:** May 13th, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; There&#39;s a couple of Level-1s in the Filing Room. We just assumed that the nanobots took them and then did whatever it is that they do. We knew infected personnel had been dropping life signals but we never knew why. 
&gt; 
&gt; We all got a slip of paper in our pockets today, a copy of mine is attached below.

&gt; 
&gt; All of ours said the same thing, excluding our &#34;Unregistered Citizen&#34; number. This is going to be our last communication. We took a vote and we&#39;ve decided, almost unanimously, that none of us want to exist in a world where you can be kidnapped or killed or whatever the hell it is that they do just for not completing a sheet of paper. We also made a majority vote against starvation. We’re out of food, comms are down, we can’t establish communication that doesn’t get intercepted somewhere in the middle. Unless the alert system has been compromised, our containment facilities seem to be operating fine without us anyway. Hell, maybe they&#39;re doing our work for us at this point.
&gt; 
&gt; Point is, we&#39;re going to the armory. We&#39;ll get contaminated on the way there, but we don&#39;t plan to leave the armory once we get there anyway. None of us know anything about robotics anyway. We&#39;ve got a final request, on behalf of the entire team. Please, neutralize them. Please kill that mother[[span style=&#34;background-color:black; color:white;&#34;]]loving[[/span]]█ thing in the sky. Or things. Whatever.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck in the new world, and godspeed.

[[tab Miscellaneous &#34;SCP Article&#34; #138]]
**Item #:** SCP-6606

**Object Class:** Spectrum

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6606 cannot be contained. Thusly, Foundation efforts should be focused on neutralization. At the time of writing, all attempts to neutralize SCP-6606 have failed. 

On 9/8/2024, procedure Evac-Red was put into effect. The ship S.C.P.E. Atum-Khepri launched successfully on 10/25/2024, containing 22 crew members. Attempts at maintaining a stabilized society on Earth will be continued by the remaining Foundation staff. An SK-Class Dominance Shift Scenario has been declared. 

In the event that SCP-6606 departs from the planet while humanity remains, or that SCP-6606 is neutralized, a societal reconstruction process will begin. Otherwise, an IK-Class Collapse of Global Civilization Scenario is to be declared.

**Description:** SCP-6606 refers to a large spacefaring vessel. The vessel is believed to be roughly 1/16th the size of the Earth, and remains in place roughly 175,000km above ocean level, within the planet&#39;s exosphere.

SCP-6606 is theorized to be the cause of a worldwide anomaly which affects all recorded documentation, as this anomaly only began following its arrival to earth&#39;s atmosphere. SCP-6606 is capable of changing any form of recorded information in any manner. SCP-6606 is capable of editing written documents, audio and video recordings, electronic text and messages, radio waves and frequencies, artistic depictions, photographs (both physical and digital), animated images, etc. Regardless of the quality of the editing, any human that perceives the edited information will treat it as though it were the original copy, and that the information, no matter how incorrect, illogical, or nonsensical it may be, is both factual, regular, and normal. 

The editing of recorded information is done instantaneously and can occur at any moment. It is believed that SCP-6606 is capable of perceiving any and all records and the information contained within at all times. SCP-6606 has used these abilities to manipulate vital, sometimes confidential and/or classified information from the ranks of all major world governments and organizations, including the SCP Foundation. This has lead to the collapse of most, if not all major governments, allowing itself to take their place and establish authority over humanity.

It is currently believed that SCP-6606 is the creator and/or controller of a mass of virus-like nanomachines, SCP-6606-1. SCP-6606-1 is believed to be the cause of a worldwide psychological anomaly. Humans affected by said anomaly will experience an intense psychological effect which causes them to feel the urge to complete any unfinished documents which have yet to be completed when they become aware of said documents. When a stack of the same documentation type is detected or redetected by an infected individual, only one must be completed. Additionally, individuals will only experience this effect when the documentation appears to be directly intended for them to complete, or when the documentation does not appear to be directed at anyone in particular. 

When a document is complete, the affected human will return the document to a &#34;documentation acquisition receptacle.&#34; This is most-often defined as the area that the documentation was acquired from, although items such as mailboxes, mail deposit slots, bank capsule chutes, etc. have been known to satisfy this as well. Once a completed document is placed in a &#34;documentation acquisition receptacle,&#34; the document disappears. Where the document goes, if anywhere, is currently unknown.

Although this is their main purpose, it is believed that instances of SCP-6606-1, when operating as a larger mass, can complete most tasks designed for humans. Notably, this has resulted in SCP-6606-1 instances continuing to uphold the containment procedures for multiple SCPs where distinctly human input is not required, and site staff have been compromised. SCP-6606-1 instances likely do this in an effort to protect SCP-6606 rather than any sense of moral obligation.

**Addendum 6606-1:** Notice on Front Door of Abandoned Facility

&gt; To whoever finds this note, I&#39;m sorry. We&#39;ve failed you. We tried to fight them as best as we could, but like they did to everyone else, they systematically tore us apart. Anything we tried to do, they had some sort of solution for. The last solution we have is to evacuate. We have managed to prevent a great number of things from taking humanity apart, but somehow, they managed to slip between our fingers and bite us. 
&gt; We have gathered a group comprised of people that we believe will allow us to start over elsewhere, wherever &#34;else&#34; may be. 
&gt; 
&gt; We don&#39;t know where we&#39;re going, only that, like cowards, we are going there.
&gt; 
&gt; -Dr. Patra, and what remains of Site-19.

**Addendum 6606-2:** 6/23/2023

&gt; **Lunar Site-32 Observatory Report:** June 23rd, 2023.
&gt; 
&gt; At 02:34 GMT, the Foundation Deep Space Telescope &#34;Osiris&#34; transmitted an image of the extrasolar planet &#34;Kepler-22b&#34; (//KOI-087.01//) as part of a routine bimonthly image capturing of terra analogues. As opposed to the planet&#39;s usual blue coloration due to it being an &#34;ocean planet&#34;, the planet possessed a green coloration with a large purple spot. Further image analysis showed the planet to be covered in the bodies of humanoid aquatic extraterrestrials, floating motionless on the planet&#39;s surface. A spacecraft can be seen rising from the mass of bodies, believed to be an escape vessel. The cause of this mass extinction event is unknown.

&gt; **Lunar Site-32 Observatory Report:** June 24th, 2023.
&gt; 
&gt; At 16:11 GMT, researchers at the Site-32 Observatory noted that a large spacecraft of purple coloration entered direct observation range. Assuming the vessel is completely solid, it is estimated to be ~62,004,931,000km^3, roughly 1/16 the size of the planet Earth. At 23:42, the vessel came to rest in Earth&#39;s exosphere, ~175,000km above sea level. Due to the size of the vessel and the proximity of the vessel to the planet, it is believed to be visible from all locations on earth. Therefor, Site-32 recommends an operation normalizing government communication with extraterrestrials to ensure peace, or neutralizing the vessel ASAP.

**Addendum 6606-3:** 7/16/2023

&gt; **Operation Phone Home Daily Report:** July 16th, 2023
&gt; 
&gt; Attempts to establish radio communications with the vessel have officially failed. We have exhausted all possible radio/satellite communication methods. We will continue attempting various methods of communication. We are taking a break day tomorrow and then we will attempt to communicate via visual methods.
&gt; 
&gt; -Lunar Site-32

&gt; **Operation Phone Home Daily Report:** September 24th, 2023
&gt; 
&gt; Attempts to gain any attention from the vessel have failed. We have attempted to gain the vessel&#39;s interest via light redirection, audio disruptions, electromagnetic pulses, and various images, documents, and videos broadcasted onto the side of the vessel. We are suggesting the use of anomalous methods of gaining the attention of the vessel in order to establish communication. 
&gt; 
&gt; Additionally, it has been suggested by some staff members that there may not be any sentient lifeforms aboard the vessel, or that the vessel may not be hollow to begin with. 
&gt; 
&gt; We will await O5 approval for the use of anomalous communication methods.
&gt; -Lunar Site-32

&gt; **Operation Phone Home Daily Report:** May 2nd, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; Attempts to communicate with SCP-6606 through anomalous methods have officially failed. The use of safe and &#34;thaumiel&#34; class anomalies to communicate with SCP-6606 have all failed, and attempts to communicate with SCP-6606 via thaumaturgy and other magic-based methods have all failed. We recommend declaring communications with SCP-6606 to be a lost cause. As SCP-6606 has made no alterations to its state of being since its arrival, many on-site staff members believe SCP-6606 to be empty and/or pilotless. 
&gt; 
&gt; In the interest of precaution, we continue to recommend neutralizing SCP-6606 ASAP.
&gt; 
&gt; -Lunar Site-32

**Addendum 6606-4:** 5/21/2024

&gt; **Area-12 Emergency Isolation Alert:** May 5th, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; **ALERT: ALL FACILITIES. ENGAGE FACILITY LOCKDOWNS. UNKNOWN AIRBORNE PATHOGEN DETECTED. SEAL OFF INFECTED AREAS AND ENGAGE OXYGEN RECYCLING SYSTEMS.**

&gt; **Lunar Site-32 Emergency Message:** May 5th, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; At 12:36pm GMT, SCP-6606 was observed creating small ripples in its outer &#34;hull.&#34; Closer observation via high-power telescope shows that SCP-6606 may have produced something during this process. Keep your eyes peeled, home team. God knows what it just sent your way. 

&gt; **Area-12 Foundation-wide Broadcast:** May 6th, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; Our entire observation and containment wing has been contaminated. Most systems within are being operated by AI constructs or infected personnel. We&#39;ve sealed off a small section of the building, mostly the break room and some offices, and flooded an office with contaminated air for closer study. 
&gt; 
&gt; Whatever this is has almost certainly infected most of the public. There&#39;s a lot of it and it seems to infect humans quite quickly. Restrict outside travel unless deemed necessary. Use O2 tanks from your facility&#39;s recycler along with a rebreather when moving outdoors. 
&gt; 
&gt; Personnel are dropping off the Health Signifier, life signs aren&#39;t being returned and neither are their locations. Stay safe, stay alert, stay secure.

&gt; **Area-12 Foundation-wide Broadcast:** May 7th, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; A few microscopes in storage have been salvaged. We&#39;re attempting methods of containing the pathogen in a smaller, more easily-observable container. We&#39;d like to request a C4 Explosive Charge to be detonated at Facility Door 7. 

&gt; **Area-12 Foundation-wide Broadcast:** May 9th, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; What&#39;s left of us is huddled in the break room, or rather, the contained portions of it. We will be making no further requests. 
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Connors managed to slide a small dish of air contaminated with the pathogen through the air duct before the automatic seals dropped. He climbed into the vent and the door crushed his arm. Please remember him.

&gt; **Area-12 Foundation-wide Broadcast:** May 10th, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; It is not a pathogen, it is a machine. Hundreds of thousands of them, smaller than our eyes can see. None of us are robotics experts, but given that they have adamantly attempted to avoid observation, even within the dish, we believe that they are either:

&gt; **Area-12 Foundation-wide Broadcast:** May 11th, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; There was a series of &#34;booms&#34; earlier today. The facility shook slightly but there was no major damage. Of note, however, is that we briefly lost connection to each of our Health Signifiers and Communication Bands. Dr. Brooks, who was contaminated in the &#34;Door 7 Mishap&#34; knocked on the door to the break room and held a note against the window of the door for us to read. &#34;Went to armory. EMPs didn&#39;t stop them.&#34;

&gt; **Area-12 Foundation-wide Broadcast:** May 13th, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; There&#39;s a couple of Level-1s in the Filing Room. We just assumed that the nanobots took them and then did whatever it is that they do. We knew infected personnel had been dropping life signals but we never knew why. 
&gt; 
&gt; We all got a slip of paper in our pockets today, a copy of mine is attached below.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **NOTICE FROM THE SPECTRUM OFFICE OF INFORMANTS FOR CITIZENS RELATED TO REJECTED REEVALUEES**
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Spectrum Says: Hello, Unregistered Citizen M2167!
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; On May 8th, 2024, F21735 (Clairice &#34;Level-One&#34; Sinclaire) was submitted for reevaluation for the following reasons:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; * Failure to complete a Miscellaneous &#34;SCP Article&#34; document (x27)
&gt;&gt; * Failure to complete a Miscellaneous &#34;Area-12 Item Requisition Form&#34; document (x135)
&gt;&gt; * Failure to complete a Miscellaneous &#34;Area-12 Staff Requisition Form&#34; document (x238)
&gt;&gt; * Failure to complete a Miscellaneous &#34;Area-12 Major Operation Request Form&#34; document (x22)
&gt;&gt; * Failure to complete a Miscellaneous Unspecified Document Type (x1,624)
&gt;&gt; * Failure to submit a Spectrum Hospitalization Documentation Pamphlet on behalf of F21748 (Christine &#34;One-er&#34; Stanfield) to report a(n): Expiration. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; We regret to inform you that F21735 **FAILED** reevaluation.

&gt;&gt; //Spectrum: Family and Friends, Together!//
&gt; 
&gt; All of ours said the same thing, excluding our &#34;Unregistered Citizen&#34; number. This is going to be our last communication. We took a vote and we&#39;ve decided, almost unanimously, that none of us want to exist in a world where you can be kidnapped or killed or whatever the hell it is that they do just for not completing a sheet of paper. We also made a majority vote against starvation. We’re out of food, comms are down, we can’t establish communication that doesn’t get intercepted somewhere in the middle. Unless the alert system has been compromised, our containment facilities seem to be operating fine without us anyway. Hell, maybe they&#39;re doing our work for us at this point.
&gt; 
&gt; Point is, we&#39;re going to the armory. We&#39;ll get contaminated on the way there, but we don&#39;t plan to leave the armory once we get there anyway. None of us know anything about robotics anyway. We&#39;ve got a final request, on behalf of the entire team. Please, neutralize them. Please kill that mother[[span style=&#34;background-color:black; color:white;&#34;]]loving[[/span]]█ thing in the sky. Or things. Whatever.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck in the new world, and godspeed.

**Addendum 6606-6:** 9/10/24

&gt; **Evac-Red Report:** September 10th, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; We&#39;ve selected 48 potential candidates. We have estimated to have enough resources for 25.

&gt; **Evac-Red Report:** September 16th, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; We have selected 22. 

&gt; **Evac-Red Report:** September 22nd, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; We have made use of the remaining resources from various space and aeronautics organizations, or rather what remains of them. 

&gt; **Evac-Red Report:** October 14th, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; Atum-Khepri is nearing completion. Production of final payload materials has begun.

&gt; **Evac-Red Report:** October 16th, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; Materials required for final payload are low. Supplies are straining, interacting with infected individuals to acquire these materials has become a difficult and lengthy process.

&gt; **Evac-Red Report:** October 20th, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; Final payload has been completed. Making final preparations now.

&gt; **Evac-Red Report:** October 24th, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; Final Notice:
&gt; If you work for the SCP Foundation, you can ignore this message. In the event that we finally crumble and collapse as an organization, we are leaving this note for any survivors. We will be leaving this planet tomorrow. We were your protectors, operating in your shadow. We&#39;ve saved you from the simplistically inexplicable to the downright ungodly, but all of that had to be done through an orderly method. We had a chain of command, same as any other government, and we operated as quickly and efficiently as possible through it. Documents, notes, letters, reports, articles, journals. We had and catalogued any and all information relating to the unspeakable things we kept here, and then some.
&gt; 
&gt; Then that thing in the sky got here, and every single thing about our modus operandi began falling apart. The same goes for many major governments; Capitols fell and chains of command broke. The US launched a MOAB at China, Russia blew up the UK, and so on, and yet they never declared war. No one remembered giving the commands, but the letters and reports say otherwise. Whatever country that wasn&#39;t stable enough to have had a strong government was eventually overrun by the ones that used to. Of note is that they never seemed to care what we wrote about them, only what could be used against ourselves.
&gt; 
&gt; You might notice a significant length of time is missing from your memory. We weighed the options, how things could play out, and we concluded that it was better to simply allow you to forget the old world. You&#39;re better off not knowing what better times were like, it would only make you destroy yourselves faster. We aren&#39;t the first species to succumb to that thing, but maybe, by letting you forget, we can draw out our collapse long enough to outlive its stay. 
&gt; 
&gt; That said, we&#39;d all like to leave you with this final, summarizing note. It&#39;ll be left for you somewhere where getting your hands on security clearance isn&#39;t necessary. If you&#39;re reading this message, then you&#39;ve probably already seen it, and the information that corroborates everything this notice has told you. 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &#34;To whoever finds this note, I&#39;m sorry. We&#39;ve failed you. We tried to fight them as best as we could, but like they did to everyone else, they systematically tore us apart. Anything we tried to do, they had some sort of solution for. The last solution we have is to evacuate. We have managed to prevent a great number of things from taking humanity apart, but somehow, they managed to slip between our fingers and bite us.
&gt;&gt; We have gathered a group comprised of people that we believe will allow us to start over elsewhere, wherever &#34;else&#34; may be.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; We don&#39;t know where we&#39;re going, only that, like cowards, we are going there.&#34;


&gt; **Evac-Red Report:** October 25th, 2024.
&gt; 
&gt; Evac-Red team is prepared for liftoff. Intended landing site has been intentionally undecided. Launch will occur at 12:30:00. All non-essential staff are advised to evacuate, and to spend their lives with their loved ones.

&gt; **Evac-Red Final Report:** October 25th, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; S.C.P.E. Atum-Khepri launched successfully. Type-E Amnestic Payload was successfully deployed. All sites have returned successful memory retention alerts, all sites have indicated that all personnel and civilians who did not receive the Counter-Mnestic have lost all non-essential memories. Goodbye.
