**Item #:** SCP-1031

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-1031 is to be kept in a secure storage locker at Site ██.  It may be removed for experimentation but must be returned set to &#34;Off&#34; and with SCP-1031-2 attached to the side with adhesive tape.

**Description:**  SCP-1031 is a heavy duty weatherproof ABS plastic box measuring 20cm×15cm×5cm, weighing 770g and coloured mid-grey.  The box is sealed shut.  Screws are visible in deep shafts at each corner, but the screw heads appear to have been reamed out to prevent extraction.  A grooved circular metal strap and associated tightening mechanism (&#34;jubilee clip&#34;) is attached to the centre of one 20×15cm side, and a printed vinyl label is affixed to the opposite side.  The label identifies the box as a &#34;██████████ Ltd[[footnote]]██████████ Ltd has been traced through Companies House and contacted by a Foundation front organisation.  They claim never to have produced such a device, and that they are, in fact, a fashion clothing manufacturer.[[/footnote]] Red Light Enforcement Module&#34;, gives instructions for attaching the box to a traffic light pole, and warns that the item is &#34;Tamper-proof!  Do not attempt to open!&#34; accompanied by an iconic representation of an intruder being [DATA EXPUNGED].  Below the label is a keyhole, around which are three labelled settings: &#34;Off&#34;, &#34;Enforce&#34; and &#34;Mark&#34;.

SCP-1031-2 is a key which fits the keyhole on SCP-1031.  It appears to have no special properties and has been successfully copied by a Foundation locksmith using standard techniques.  It does not appear to be possible to open the box using the key.

SCP-1031 appears to be inert unless it is (a) attached to a traffic light pole (with lights actively operating in a sequence including red and green phases) in the manner described on the label, and (b) set to &#34;enforce&#34; or &#34;mark&#34; using SCP-1031-2.  See attached logs for more information on the item&#39;s effects.

It should be noted that SCP-1031 does not require (indeed, has no connections for) any power or other connection, and has not been observed to actually **do** anything itself (although the effects noted in the test log below are clearly caused by SCP-1031&#39;s presence and the position of its keyway).  There are no lamps or other indicators on the box.  How its effects are caused is currently unknown.

SCP-1031 was retrieved by Agent ███████ from a road-side location in south-west ██████, UK on ██/██/████ after analysis of road traffic accident data revealed the recent very sudden formation of an accident black-spot.  SCP-1031-2 had been left in the keyway of SCP-1031.

**Test log 1031-01:**  Testing was carried out at Research Site-██.  A traffic signal was installed at a suitable position in the car park, programmed with a simple 30-second green/red sequence and SCP-1031 was installed on the same pole according to its attached instructions.  A white line was painted across the road beside the pole, and D-class test subjects ordered to drive a vehicle across the line.

**Date:** ██/██/████

**Subject:** D-3879
**Key setting:** Off
**Vehicle type:** Hatchback, 1.1L
**Speed:** 30kph
**Phase:** Vehicle reached line during green phase
**Result:** No effect.  Subject stopped vehicle 14m beyond line for further instructions.

**Subject:** D-3879
**Key setting:** Off
**Vehicle type:** Hatchback, 1.1L
**Speed:** 30kph
**Phase:** Vehicle reached line during red phase
**Result:** No effect.  Subject stopped vehicle 12m beyond line for further instructions.

**Subject:** D-3879
**Key setting:** Enforce
**Vehicle type:** Hatchback, 1.1L
**Speed:** 30kph
**Phase:** Vehicle reached line during green phase
**Result:** No effect.  Subject stopped vehicle 9m beyond line for further instructions.

**Subject:** D-3879
**Key setting:** Enforce
**Vehicle type:** Hatchback, 1.1L
**Speed:** 30kph
**Phase:** Vehicle reached line during red phase
**Result:** Vehicle halted suddenly at line, as if in collision with a fixed object.  Air bag deployed.  Subject suffered bruising to chest due to seat belt and reported feeling &#34;shaken&#34;.  Full width of vehicle front bumper crushed; little other damage to vehicle.

**Subject:** D-3880
**Key setting:** Enforce
**Vehicle type:** Hatchback, 1.1L
**Speed:** 30kph
**Phase:** Vehicle&#39;s front bumper crossed line 0.2 seconds before start of red phase; vehicle still crossing line at start of red phase
**Result:** No effect.  Subject stopped vehicle 17m beyond line for further instructions.

**Subject:** D-3880
**Key setting:** Enforce
**Vehicle type:** Hatchback, 1.1L
**Speed:** 50kph
**Phase:** Vehicle reached line during red phase
**Result:** Upon crossing line, front tyres immediately deflated with a loud &#34;bang&#34; causing subject to lose control.  Vehicle halted 27m past line, facing sideways relative to its direction of travel.  Subject physically unhurt but claimed to be &#34;out of sorts&#34;.

**Subject:** D-3881
**Key setting:** Enforce
**Vehicle type:** Bicycle
**Speed:** 15kph
**Phase:** Vehicle reached line during red phase
**Result:** Upon crossing line, front wheel became solidly fixed to road surface.  Subject flung over handle-bars and suffered bruising and minor cuts on impact with road surface.  Bicycle remained upright with wheel fixed in position; bicycle could be rotated around fixed wheel.  5 seconds before red phase ended, wheel became free to move and bicycle fell to road surface.  No damage discovered to road surface, tyre or wheel at point of adhesion.

**Subject:** D-3882
**Key setting:** Enforce
**Vehicle type:** Motorcycle, 750cc
**Speed:** 40kph
**Phase:** Vehicle reached line during red phase
**Result:** Upon crossing line, vehicle&#39;s drive chain broke.  Subject reported momentary loss of control but was able to bring the machine to a halt safely 8m beyond line.  Subject physically unhurt.

**Subject:** D-3880
**Key setting:** Mark
**Vehicle type:** Hatchback, 1.1L
**Speed:** 50kph
**Phase:** Vehicle reached line during red phase
**Result:** As vehicle crossed the line, horizontal red stripes 23cm wide appeared along both left and right sides of the vehicle approximately 80cm above ground level, as if spray-painted by a stationary agent while the vehicle was in motion.  Later examination showed no evidence of an extra layer of paint having been added; the original paint-work&#39;s colour seems to have been altered.  Removal of the stripes is estimated to require a full respray of the affected panels.

**Subject:** D-3882
**Key setting:** Mark
**Vehicle type:** Motorcycle, 750cc
**Speed:** 40kph
**Phase:** Vehicle reached line during red phase
**Result:** Red stripes 23cm wide and 80cm above ground level appeared on both sides of the motorcycle.  Where the stripe crossed the subject&#39;s leg, the colour change appeared on the subject&#39;s clothing (shorts) and, where not covered, skin.  Subject screamed as the colour change occurred; subject later reported that pain had occurred in the affected area and had disappeared as quickly as it had appeared.  Affected areas of the subject&#39;s skin have become a uniform bright red colour matching the stripe on the vehicle.  Washing with soap and water does not affect colouration; study of skin biopsies is recommended to determine how the change has been effected.
