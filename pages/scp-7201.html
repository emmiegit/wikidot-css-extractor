**Special Containment Procedures:** There is no reliable method to contain SCP-7201. Additionally, due to the brevity of the events,[[footnote]] Which regularly span 10-30 minutes. [[/footnote]] it is virtually impossible to prevent the manifestation of SCP-7201-1 instances. Instead, funding directed to the containment of the anomaly is to be delegated to researching the causes and trajectory of SCP-7201 events.

When an SCP-7201-1 instance is reported, MTF-Alpha-19 is to be deployed to the location of the sighting. Neutralization of an instance can typically be accomplished with ordinary firepower. Currently, Site-50 has two SCP-7201-1 instances in containment for research. As such, there is no need to attempt to contain any further instances.

-----

**Description:** SCP-7201 denotes an anemological [[footnote]] Relating to meteorological wind. [[/footnote]] phenomenon known to occur in deserts or otherwise highly arid regions. During an SCP-7201 event, sand, twigs, and bone fragments from deceased animals will conjoin at a single point or points, where SCP-7201-1 instances will manifest.

SCP-7201-1 instances are sentient collections of the materials listed above. The entities are often vaguely humanoid, with heavily distorted appendages and physical attributes. SCP-7201-1 instances are capable of extending &#34;tendrils&#34; from their appendages and have been observed using them to capture prey, typically small animals.

SCP-7201-1 instances are known to emit a loud, incoherent screeching sound. Whether they are capable of human speech is unknown.

The anomaly has been designated as hostile, and a moderate threat to human life, due to numerous disappearances and probable deaths associated with sightings. However, there is currently no evidence of SCP-7201-1 instances expressing violence.[[footnote]] Prior to the update, no corpses had been discovered. [[/footnote]]

SCP-7201 was first discovered when Foundation weather outlets noted suspicious meteorological activity, such as spontaneous thunderstorms and intense winds. An official investigation into the anomaly was compiled after a video of drone footage began circulating in South Africa. In the video, an SCP-7201-1 instance is briefly visible when the drone passes over a canyon.

-----

**Update:** On 23/07/1996, four German tourists were reported missing in the Death Valley National Park. Following a search and rescue effort by local authorities which failed to recover the tourists, Foundation agents were alerted of possible anomalous activity.

After an ontokinetic energy[[footnote]] Energy produced by reality-bending anomalies or those related to manifestation and demanifestation. [[/footnote]] test concluded the disappearances were not a result of anomalous dematerialization, another search party was compiled. Three hours into the search, Foundation agents discovered a Nikon camera containing recent videography with all four of the tourists, Egbert Rimkus, Georg Weber, Cornelia Meyer, and Max Meyer, present. A transcript of the video can be found below.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border: solid 2px #0F5D79&#34;]]
//Portion of the video prior to the relevant event cut for brevity.//

//The four tourists are walking through the Grotto canyon. The camera glances around the scene, mainly focusing on the impressive canyon walls. As they are walking, a sudden crunch is heard from under Egbert Rimkus&#39; feet. A slight sandy fog has settled. Cornelia Meyer appears frustrated.//

**C. Meyer:** Ich sagte doch, wir hätten mit einer Gilde kommen sollen.

**E. Rimkus:** Ich habe Ihnen bereits gesagt, dass ich keine Lust habe, dafür zu bezahlen, dass ich mit jemandem, der kein Deutsch spricht, zusammenhanglos hin- und herschreie.

//Georg Weber narrowly avoids stepping on a cactus while non-aggressively wrestling with Max Meyer.//

**C. Meyer:** Passt auf, wo ihr hintretet, Kinder. Wir können uns hier kaum zurechtfinden, wir haben keine Zeit, ein Krankenhaus für euch zu finden.

//A sudden wind begins pulling layers of sand into the air and to a central point in the distance. Within the layers of moving sand are several pieces of garbage and other small objects. The parent tourists remain still for two minutes as the wind becomes stronger. Cornelia Meyer looks around, confused.//

**E. Rimkus:** Hätte der Wind heute so stark sein sollen?

**C. Meyer:** Das glaube ich nicht. Verdammtes amerikanisches Wetter. Wir sollten uns einen Aufenthaltsraum suchen, Schatz.

//In the distance, an SCP-7201-1 instance takes form, barely in frame. The tourists appear oblivious to it. Egbert Rimkus stops walking and pulls a wadded-up map out of his pocket, holding the camera to his side.//

**E. Rimkus:** Ich glaube, ich habe eine Karte. Da sollte eine Lounge drauf sein.

//Egbert Rimkus hands the map to Cornelia Meyer and holds the camera up. For a second, the camera pans to the instance before directing back to the others. It is likely Egbert Rimkus mistook the instance for a dead tree.//

**C. Meyer:** Die nächste Lounge ist etwa einen Kilometer von hier entfernt. Dieser Wind ist unerträglich. Kinder, nehmt meine Hände.

//Cornelia Meyer huddles with the children, Georg Weber and Max Meyer.//

**C. Meyer:** Ich kann keine fünf Meter vor mir etwas sehen. Der Wind nimmt weiter zu.

//The SCP-7201-1 instance is out of frame at this point, having likely taken full form.//

**E. Rimkus:** Sind das Knochen?

**C. Meyer:** Oh mein Gott! Es ist eine Leiche.

//The decomposed corpse in the sand is missing most of its contents. Suddenly, one leg bone snaps off and begins pulling toward the SCP-7201-1 instance.//

**M. Meyer:** Was ist los, Mami? Ich habe Angst.

**E. Rimkus:** Wir müssen von hier verschwinden.

//A sudden, loud shrieking is heard. The camera pans to the SCP-7201-1 instance emerging from the sand storm in a stumbling motion.//

**E. Rimkus:** Was ist das?

//The camera becomes hazy as Egbert Rimkus begins walking faster. One of the children lets out a scream. The SCP-7201-1 instance bursts into a sprint, its shrieking growing louder as Egbert Rimkus shouts incoherently to the others.//

//Several tendrils sprout out of SCP-7201-1’s torso and begin wrapping around the tourists&#39; faces, narrowly missing Egbert Rimkus. The tendrils shove the others into the sand. One swings at Egbert Rimkus again, knocking him to the ground. The camera flies out of his hand and lands in the sand.//

//The four tendrils are wrapped around each tourist’s face, shoving them into the ground. The SCP-7201-1 hops in a spider-like motion to each tourist and embeds them further in the sand, using its appendages to claw at the sand. Despite the individuals kicking and violently thrashing, the SCP-7201-1 instance manages buries each tourist in the sand before retreating out of view.//

//The footage continues for another thirteen hours before abruptly ending. No activity is seen.//
[[/div]]

Following the recovery of this footage, Foundation agents began excavating the area and the tourists were found, being buried shallowly enough to breathe. All four of the tourists were alive but restricted to the ground by roots[[footnote]] The ends of an instance&#39;s tendrils that are used to secure prey. [[/footnote]] from the SCP-7201 instance. It is presumed the tourists would’ve died from dehydration should they not have been found.

Upon the excavation of several sites where SCP-7201 was known to have manifested, a large number of human bodies were discovered. It is likely a body will only contribute to an SCP-7201-1 instance when it has mostly or fully decomposed. Later analysis of the roots suggests they had been acquiring nutrients by latching onto the victims’ skin. The corpses were all entangled in roots similar to the tourists.

Around the same time as these events, Site-50 reported alarming activity concerning the two SCP-7201-1 instances in its custody. 

According to the report, the two instances had suddenly conjoined together to form a larger, ostensibly more dangerous instance. It is unknown if this can happen with any two instances, and is currently being researched. Multiple viewers of the instance not directly assigned to SCP-7201 have requested amnesticization due to its obscenely grotesque appearance. The details of its appearance can be provided upon request, but have not been included in this file.

SCP-7201 is pending Critical risk reclassification due to this discovery.
