||||||||~ Initial Report||
||~ Author || Connor Krain ||~ Date || May 25, 2017||
||~ Interest||Low||~ Identifier||Pulp Fanfiction||
||||||||Item originally discovered through reports of uncannily well-written personal fanfiction commissioned by GAW members. Using internal connections, the creator of said stories, referred to as &#34;the Author&#34;, was located and, after a period of investigation and communication, a contract was agreed upon and a supply chain established. _
 _
While the books are themselves non-anomalous, the information inside them is obtained anomalously. As such, the Author requires an object of personal significance to the buyer to accurately emulate their personality within the confines of the story. _
 _
Although the production of each item takes on average three days, the niche market it targets, combined with the enthralling nature of the item&#39;s contents, should ensure a small but loyal group of customers are sustained through regular purchases of further installments.||

||||||||~ Incident Report 01||
||||||||~ TUP9I/LFOCI/2ONIP ||
||~ Author || Connor Krain ||~ Date || June 6, 2018||
|||||||| Complaints have been received that several items contained actions performed by the protagonist that unsettled the buyer and discouraged further purchases. While the Author maintains that this is due to the customers&#39; uncomfortableness with what they themselves are capable of, it is clear that change must occur if this item is to remain profitable. _
 _
The current plan is to incorporate another item of dwindling interest, &#39;Starsquid Ink&#39; (O3IEV/5E6CD/7T4LP), into the creation of each item, as it possesses a minor manipulation effect that changes all text written in it to become more palatable to the reader. This combined item will be monitored closely following its release next month.||

||||||||~ Incident Report 02||
||||||||~ TUP9I/LFOCI/2ONIP ||
||~ Author || Iris Dark ||~ Date || May 6th, 2019||
|||||||| Coinciding with a sudden drop in item requests following an unusually high period of growth, multiple reports of reality-shifting events occurred globally. Immediately, an internal investigation revealed Mr. Krain, the employee in charge of this project, was compromised several months ago by the Author. Furthermore, all information concerning the Author has been retroactively erased, much to my disappointment. _
 _
It appears that, after the introduction of &#39;Starsquid Ink&#39; (O3IEV/5E6CD/7T4LP) into Pulp Fanfictions in a desperate attempt to recover sales, customers grew more invested and immersed in the stories they received. While this initially led to an increase in sales, all buyers, including first-time readers, became unnaturally obsessed with their personalized tales. These obsessions continued uninhibited as any information about this reaction was suppressed by Mr. Krain. _
 _
This culminated in over 250 individuals unconsciously warping reality to reproduce and live out the circumstances found in the items they purchased. The Foundation and GOC have been contacted to help prevent further damage and destroy all remaining instances of the items. Although it is too soon to tell, I have a suspicion that the fifthists are in some way related to this. _
 _
Mr. Krain, the Author, and all twenty-three of the apprentices, along with the remaining supply of Starsquid Ink, remain unaccounted for; multiple missions are currently underway to capture or eliminate them. While no further contact between the Author has been received since the incident, they did leave something behind for us. ||
