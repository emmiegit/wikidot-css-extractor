[[include component:image-block name=2981.jpg|caption=SCP-2981 as photographed by a student prior to containment.  Images do not carry SCP-2981&#39;s effects.]]





**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2981 is to be contained at Site-19 in a freezer located in containment area 14A.  To prevent spoilage, fresh mashed potatoes are to be placed in the freezer alongside SCP-2981.  Following a period of 4 days, SCP-2981&#39;s container should be emptied of its contents and cleaned before replacement.  Personnel carrying out this process are not allowed to leave the containment area with SCP-2981 and/or the mashed potatoes.


**Description:** SCP-2981 is a 4.8 kilogram mass of mashed potatoes displaying a cognitohazardous effect in which affected individuals[[footnote]]Testing has found this to affect 44.7% of individuals exposed to SCP-2981.[[/footnote]] perceive SCP-2981 as being a living person.  When confronted by another individual on the subject of SCP-2981 in conversation or prolonged physical contact, this effect abruptly ceases its effect upon the affected individual and begins to affect the other individual[[footnote]]This effect has taken between 15 minutes to 4 hours to occur.[[/footnote]].  This effect has not been observed affecting more than three individuals at a time.


Proximity[[footnote]]Estimated based on field reports and observations to be between 1 and 3 meters.[[/footnote]] of non-anomalous potatoes to SCP-2981 causes SCP-2981 to effectively spread, causing the potatoes to become a part of SCP-2981[[footnote]]Potatoes that are not mashed will begin to melt and rot if not properly preserved.[[/footnote]].



**Discovery:** SCP-2981 was first noticed on ████████ University where missing person flyers were discovered around the █████ Campus, seeking out an individual named &#34;Alan ██████ ████&#34;.  No identifying information or photograph was attached.  Campus security tracked the flyers to an assistant professor, Yuan █████.  Upon interview, Mrs. █████ claimed to have no knowledge of an &#34;Alan ██████ ████&#34;.  Several days later, Mrs. █████ contacted campus security, claiming to have located &#34;Alan&#39;s remains&#34;.  Security were directed to a lounge, and SCP-2981 was located and identified.  Mrs. █████ abruptly left the scene, leaving security to contact local police to report a potential homicide.  


Officers on the scene could not find the alleged suspect, and a security guard, Mr. Shockley, took SCP-2981 with him home.  At this point, SCP-2981 could not be accounted for until 19:00, at which point a student having dinner at the campus cafeteria was verbally assaulted by another student.  The altercation led to the student, Ms. Payne, fleeing the scene with a bowl containing a new instance of SCP-2981.

At 03:06 the next day, Ms. Payne brought SCP-2981 to the clinic, claiming it to be &#34;unresponsive&#34; and &#34;bleeding profusely&#34;.  Ms. Payne had to be restrained as she became belligerent when separated from SCP-2981.  SCP-2981 was then acquired by a nurse, who brought it to tend to a patient.  Hospital staff questioned the nurse, Mr. Paulson, who maintained SCP-2981 to be a visiting friend, and apologized for allowing them to visit a patient.  Mr. Paulson did not resist being separated from SCP-2981.

At 14:21, police were called to respond to a suspicious persons report filed by a patient, Ms. Joyce, who claimed SCP-2981 to be eavesdropping and spying on the woman as she changed.  Officers on the scene identified SCP-2981 as [REDACTED] and placed it under arrest.

The incident was brought to the Foundation&#39;s attention following a brief altercation at the local police department which escalated into a pursuit on foot, as Officer ████ Jackson made off with SCP-2981, believing it to be a cancer-stricken relative named &#34;Jean&#34;.  Officer Jackson made his way across campus, heading for the clinic, before losing consciousness and dropping SCP-2981.  SCP-2981 was largely recovered intact. 


As Officer Jackson retained SCP-2981&#39;s effects throughout the incident and his subsequent detention and interview by Foundation personnel, it was not initially believed to be a cognitohazard.


&gt; +++++ Transcript of interview between Dr. Marlowe and Officer ████ Jackson.
&gt;  
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log 15 minutes in, 21:04:48&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** How long did it take for you to realize they had taken &#34;Jean&#34; into custody?
&gt; 
&gt; **Jackson:** Right away.  They were carrying her in, unconscious, said she was under arrest for potential homicide.  I checked her pulse.  She was bleeding, but still alive.  I said she was unconscious and needed to get to a hospital.  They didn&#39;t believe me, and one of the guys was saying she wasn&#39;t even human, but a big bowl of potato salad or something.  Everyone was yelling, it was a madhouse.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** And then what happened?
&gt; 
&gt; **Jackson:** She started moving.  Officer ███ then stuck his fingers in her mouth, I don&#39;t know what he was thinking, so I shoved him aside.  We got into a bit of a fight.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** How many other officers were involved?
&gt; 
&gt; **Jackson:** Just us two.  ██████ tried to break us up since he was close, but it was over before it got too vicious.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** How&#39;d it end?
&gt; 
&gt; **Jackson:** I just, I backed off.  I mean, he&#39;s my friend, I wasn&#39;t gonna break his nose or anything.  I didn&#39;t know what I was doing, so I just picked her up and left.  I remember running and passing out, then you all got involved.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** &#34;Her&#34; being Jean here?
&gt; 
&gt; **Jackson:** Yeah [Officer Jackson places a hand on SCP-2981]  She&#39;s still dirty.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** Can you tell me more about Jean?  How you came to know her, what she&#39;s like, maybe how she could&#39;ve ended up being accused of murder?
&gt; 
&gt; **Jackson:** I don&#39;t know how she ended up in cuffs... She&#39;s been on some meds for the past two years, maybe she was in some kind of fugue state.  It wasn&#39;t looking good for a while.  And ███, Jesus...
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** What about Officer ███?
&gt; 
&gt; **Jackson:** I didn&#39;t mean to hit him.  But like, as soon as I hit him, he exploded.  Lost his shit.  It was like I&#39;d never seen him before in my life, like he was someone completely different in that moment.  I was genuinely scared.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** Was he threatening her?
&gt; 
&gt; **Jackson:** Who?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** Jean.
&gt; 
&gt; **Jackson:** He was threatening //me//.  Is he pressing charges, or something, is that why I&#39;m here?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** No, nothing like that, Officer Jackson.  Once we&#39;ve finished up here, you can work it out with Officer ███ and hopefully everything will be fine.  
&gt; 
&gt; **Jackson:** Alright.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** Dr. Watts?
&gt; 
&gt; **Jackson:** Huh?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** Do you have anything to add?
&gt; 
&gt; **Jackson:** No.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** What?
&gt; 
&gt; **Jackson:** You&#39;re asking me?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** No, I was asking Dr. Watts.
&gt; 
&gt; **Jackson:** Who?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** I&#39;m sorry, Dr. Watts here has been logging our conversation, I was just wondering if she had anything else to add.
&gt; 
&gt; **Jackson:** There&#39;s no one else here.  You mean the mashed potato bowl?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** Mashed potatoes?
&gt; 
&gt; **Jackson:** I came in with this bowl of mashed potatoes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Marlowe:** [Following a long pause]  Officer Jackson, I think we may have a problem here.
