    <h2 class="header">Page Source</h2>
    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>In order to maintain our standards of quality, pages found to be substandard by the community through the voting system (e.g. the Rating Box) are removed by Staff. There are exceptions for submissions that are found to be in violation of site policy. No matter the reason for deletion, staff-handled [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/c-1113520/announcements deletions are always recorded in the Announcements forum] in the most recent Deletions thread, with reasons clearly given.

+++ Grace Period

Pages are typically afforded a grace period of **24 hours** after the posting of a deletion vote, during which time they are not eligible for removal from the site, regardless of rating. If a page is one hour or one year old, it doesn&#39;t matter. Everything gets a 24-hour period. 

+++ Standard Process

If a page’s rating falls to -10 or lower, that page becomes eligible for deletion. A member of Senior Staff (Operational Staff or higher) will make a post in its discussion thread, titled Staff Post, suggesting deletion. This post will have a timer on it, noting how long the deletion vote has been in place. When a page reaches **three** Staff votes for deletion and the deletion timer has passed **24 hours**, it is removed from the site. If a page&#39;s rating falls to -20, the timer is suspended and it becomes eligible for immediate deletion provided it has three Staff votes for deletion.

If a page’s rating rises above -10, all Staff votes for deletion prior to this are voided. Should it fall again, voting for deletion must begin anew.

If an author requests a stay of deletion to make edits or rewrite a page, these may be granted. Consideration of these requests is on a case-by-case basis, as oftentimes, the best thing is to start again from a clean slate. Supplementary pages will be automatically deleted when their parent page is. Authors may repost supplements as standalone works to be judged separately as they see fit.

+++ Reasons for Summary Deletion

There are instances when Staff will waive the standard deletions process and delete the article (with one other staff member needed as a witness). These situations are:

* Articles with malicious intent such as, but not limited to: links to viruses, sexually explicit material, spam, advertising, trolling, and illegal content.
* Pages that are physically harmful towards anyone who has any form of photosensitive epilepsy, or toward any user in general.
* Pages that are clearly unfinished. (e.g. articles with blank sections or [insert text here] notes)
* Attempts to &#34;game&#34; site procedure, such as re-posting a non-rewritten article in an attempt to get around downvotes.
* Blatantly plagiarized[[footnote]]Believed to have copied from another work, in part or in whole, on this wiki or elsewhere, or if it conceptually borrows heavily from another work, and if the new work makes no effort to credit the original work or its creator.[[/footnote]] material.
* An article posted outside of the current range[[footnote]]SCP mainlist articles are currently restricted to numbers between 001 and 6999 (Series I through VII)[[/footnote]]. Authors may repost their articles within the acceptable range as they see fit.

**Collaborative Posting:**
All posted works must be written by the user that posts the work, unless specifically noted as being a collaboration between one or more site users that are current members of the SCP-Wiki at the time of publication. Collaborative works must indicate which site users collaborated in the creation of the article in question.
* Surviving articles that are improperly attributed will be given a grace period of 48 hours from notification, where poster will be given the opportunity to provide correct attribution. After the expiration of that timer, articles that have not been corrected will be subject to summary deletion, regardless of vote count.
* Failure to abide by this policy will result in disciplinary action, according to the usual escalation procedures.
* This does not exempt articles from deletion via the standard voting process, should downvotes exceed stated thresholds.


+++ Self-Deletion

Over the course of the last few months, it has come to our attention that several pages on the SCP Wiki have become, for lack of a better term, broken. Such pages become uneditable, and will display a common error screen, as demonstrated below:

[[image https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/700445513287467128/867932367619256350/unknown.png]]
[[/collapsible]]

A common theme for these pages breaking has been frequent posting to the page slot, and then deletion of the page (ie the slot serving as a frequent destination of cold posts, etc). Renaming the SCP prior to deletion has so far been an effective means for staff to preserve the main list SCP URLs. However, there is still the risk of self-deleted pages irreversibly breaking the slots.

**As such we are putting a temporary hold on complete user self-deletions in favor of soft deletions.**

__What this means:__
* Pages hitting the deletion threshold will still be deleted by staff as normal, with the addition of the renaming workaround.
* Authors cannot manually run a complete self-delete of an article. Instead, they will soft delete it (ie renaming the article so that it is {{deleted:scp-XXXX}})
* Articles moved to {{deleted:scp-XXXX}} cannot be edited, renamed further, or have their files altered except by moderator staff or above.
* Staff will run these deletions, no questions asked, so as to preserve author autonomy.

An example of what this will look like in practice:

[[/collapsible]]

Please understand that we would not be instituting this unless it was absolutely necessary, and do so out of interest of preventing further SCP slots from becoming irreparably damaged and closed to all users to post. Additionally, note that this is only a substantial concern for SCP articles which have the potential to go through multiple post-deletion cycles and not tales/other articles.

Authors may also request deletion of all their work to be done by staff. This will likely require a basic explanation of why, and may not be immediate, but generally speaking the wiki staff will acquiesce to such requests.

If circumstances imply that a request for deletion is being made during a time of distress, or there is evidence of malice or spite on the part of the user, requests for self-deletion may be delayed or denied.

+++ More Information

Staff have a more detailed and thorough version of the deletions guide which specifies exactly how these processes take place and the policies they follow.
