Boyd kicked his heels onto the mahogany desk, a copper penny in his hand. &#34;Call it.&#34;

&#34;...tails.&#34; Fish shifted uncomfortably, reclining in the opposite chair.

&#34;...Nope. What is that, seventieth time in a row?&#34; Boyd grinned, holding the penny so it glinted in the light. &#34;I do believe that I like this one. D&#39;ya think they&#39;ll let us keep it? Or hold onto it for a while?&#34;

&#34;Well... we probably shouldn&#39;t... might get in trouble.&#34;

&#34;Ah Fish, you&#39;re no fun at all.&#34;

&gt; Item Description: A penny which, when flipped, will always land &#34;heads up&#34;.
&gt; Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
&gt; Location of Recovery: ████, ███████
&gt; Current Status: Melted down.
&gt; //Notes: Can’t believe that none of the researchers kept this to win bets with.//

&#34;…uh, Dr. Roget?&#34; Research Assistant Dwyer poked his head into the office. &#34;I got those reports finished…Hello?&#34; Finding himself alone, he slipped into the office and sat in the chair.

He thumb-twiddled, glancing around as the clock ticked. His eyes fell upon some stuff on the desk. He smiled. //I love bobbleheads// He picked it up and, with a flick-

A janitor swept the hall outside, whistling a tune to himself. He noticed the door to Dr. Roget&#39;s office ajar, and with a grumble of curiosity, peeked his head through the crack. Research Assistant Dwyer, a man in his late 20&#39;s, was sprawled out on the floor, his neck at a rather unpleasant angle.

The janitor groans with a roll of his eyes. //Not another one.// He set his broom aside, heading into the office and grabbing the foot of the now deceased researcher. With a grunt of effort, he gave the leg a quick tug, moving it toward the door.

Dr. Roget had been walking back to his office after a particularly tasty casserole. He hummed to himself as he turned to corner, and saw the janitor lugging something out of his office. &#34;Hey, what&#39;s that there?&#34;

&#34;Another dead kid.&#34; The janitor gave the leg another jerk, pulling the body out of the office. &#34;You need to start lockin&#39; your door.&#34;

Dr. Roget groaned. &#34;I always forget to put that damned thing away when I&#39;m out of the office. When will these punk kids learn to not touch other people&#39;s shit? It only leads to tragedy.&#34;

&#34;Start hidin&#39; it or somethin&#39;.&#34; The janitor grabbed his broom and started dragging Dwyer&#39;s corpse down the hall. &#34;&#39;cause I&#39;m not cleanin&#39; up the next one.&#34;

&gt; Item Description: A ██████-brand bobblehead that, when bobbled, causes the user&#39;s head to bobble with it. Can create neck injuries if bobbled too hard.
&gt; Date of Recovery: ██-██-19██
&gt; Location of recovery: Seattle, Washington
&gt; Current Status: --On Dr. Roget&#39;s office desk-- In Dr. Roget&#39;s office safe.

The maintenance shed was extremely humid, and Agent Boyd was grumbling as she dug through piles of tools. She stood up and wiped her brow.&#34;It should //not// be this difficult to find a damned hammer.&#34;

&#34;Let&#39;s just say we couldn&#39;t find it and leave.&#34; Agent Valint grinned as she leaned against the shed door, making no attempt to help.

&#34;We already did that, they won&#39;t buy it a second time.&#34; Boyd stooped down and began to dig through a pile of rakes.  //Why do they have so many damn rakes...//

Valint rolls her eyes. &#34;You know you&#39;d think they&#39;d just do it themselves, and I doubt it&#39;s in the rake pile.&#34;

Boyd tossed a particularly rusty rake to the side. &#34;You never know, with the way they keep shop around here they could be anywhere....ah!&#34; She pulled a hammer from a shelf, kicking up a cloud of dust. &#34;Hammer is located!&#34;

Valint sighed. &#34;Right…. it would be on the shelf.&#34; //Can&#39;t they ever organize this damn place for once?//

She stood up, contemplating the hammer in his hand. &#34;Alright... I kinda want to hit some stuff now. To make sure it works.&#34;

Valint shrugged. &#34;Whatever, not like we have anything better to do.&#34;

&#34;Do we have any planks... or nails...&#34; She dove back into the stuff, soon returning with a wooden plank and a rusty nail. Boyd offered the nail, plank and hammer to Valint. &#34;You want to do the honors?&#34;

&#34;Sure, why the hell not.&#34; Valint lined up the nail and hammer, took a swing... and a miss.

&#34;Nice one.&#34;

Valint frowns. &#34;What the fuck?&#34; She swung again, with the result being a second miss.

Boyd sniggered. &#34;Having problems?&#34;

&#34;Fucking hell, you do it.&#34; She shoved the hammer at Boyd.

&#34;Alright, let me show you how its done.&#34; She swung with all her might, directly onto her thumb.

//Twitch//

&#34;**FUUUUUUUUUUUUUU**&#34;

&gt; Item Description: Hammer which will consistently miss the nail intended as its target when used by humans. Use of machinery or robots to guide the hammer results in normal function.
&gt; Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
&gt; Location of Recovery:██████, ██████
&gt; Current Status: Identified by agents working in Site 19&#39;s maintenance shed, currently in storage.

&#34;Well then.&#34; Agent Ekblad removed his hat, squinting at the skylight. &#34;I do believe that is Love-Love.&#34;

&gt; Item Description: A white table-tennis ball produced by the DHS company, marked as &#34;Four Star&#34;. Note that DHS is only known to manufacture balls up to &#34;Three Star&#34; grade. In addition to showing an unusually efficient bounciness, it launches with extreme velocity when in contact with DHS-made table tennis bat rubber.
&gt; Date of Recovery █-█-████
&gt; Location of Recovery: Site-██, Recreation Room
&gt; Current Status: Item&#39;s anomalous properties were discovered when Agent Ekblad used it in a friendly match against Researcher ███. Item flew through open skylight, current location unknown.

&#34;I don&#39;t even get this one.&#34; Agent Boyd held the wig gingerly, at a fair distance from her body. &#34;I mean really, what&#39;s the point of having a wig that only works if you already have hair?&#34;

Fish stared forlornly at the tufts of hair littering the floor. &#34;... You didn&#39;t have to cut //my// hair to find out.&#34;

&#34;Well, you say that, but in all fairness it would&#39;ve taken at least 20 minutes to find a bald guy to test this with. Much quicker this way.&#34; Boyd stretched the wig onto Fish&#39;s now smooth cranium.

Fish looked up. &#34;What&#39;d it do?&#34;

&#34;.... Huh. Can&#39;t say I expected that.&#34;

&gt; Item Description: A wig that mimics the hairstyle of its wearer. When worn by bald persons, it transforms into a rubber swimming cap.
&gt; Date of Recovery: █/██/████
&gt; Location of Recovery: ███████████ shop in Omsk.
&gt; Current Status: Incinerated.

&#34;C&#39;mon, you can scrub better than that.&#34; Agent Boyd grinned, walking around her crouched partner. &#34;No pain no gain, am I right?&#34;

&#34;We&#39;ve been... working... for hours... I don&#39;t think... this is going to work.&#34; Fish panted, scrubbing the almost-squeaky clean polo shirt over a washpan with all the force his wiry body could muster.

&#34;You do make a valid point. Perhaps we could try a more efficient method of cleaning.&#34;

Fish sat back, wheezing as he struggled to catch his breath. &#34;Like... what?&#34;

&#34;Hmmm...&#34;

&gt; Item Description: A [REDACTED] brand polo shirt, with a large mustard stain on the front. The stain proved to be impossible to remove.
&gt; Date of Recovery: ██/██/1999
&gt; Location of Recovery: ████████, GA, USA.
&gt; Current Status: Destroyed during a vigorous attempt to clean it.
