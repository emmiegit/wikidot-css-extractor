**Item #:** SCP-4116

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Personnel suffering from night terrors are to be monitored until the next confirmed report of SCP-4116. Any confirmed victims of SCP-4116 are to have any memories of the final dream in the sequence documented as accurately as possible. Civilian victims of SCP-4116 are to be amnesticized after documentation of the event.

In the event that widespread public attention is brought to SCP-4116, a disinformation campaign with the aim to establish SCP-4116 as a common nightmare is to be released, with falsified statistics and psychological analysis included[[footnote]]See document 4116-E-12.[[/footnote]].

**Description:** SCP-4116 is the designation given to a series of specific recurring dreams affecting a single individual at a time. SCP-4116 has an antimemetic effect affecting the recollection of dreams, with all victims only being able to recall the final dream in the sequence. This makes identifying persons who suffer from SCP-4116 impossible until after the affliction has passed.

Despite having no recollection of the details of the other dreams, all subjects to date have manifested extreme night terrors, and report intense fear and anxiety. SCP-4116 afflictions typically last for 2-3 months, with a recorded maximum of 8 months and minimum of 1 day[[footnote]]See notes from transcript taken on 3/04/2008[[/footnote]].

The final dream in SCP-4116 has maintained several key features present in all recorded instances. It is these recurring features among separate persons with no correlations that initially led to SCP-4116&#39;s classification as anomalous. The series of events in a standard SCP-4116 dream sequence prior to awakening is as follows:
* The subject awakens in the dream. The surroundings consist of an extremely long stone corridor, the right wall solid stone and the left a series of large windows, with pillars placed periodically several meters inwards. Subjects report sensations of claustrophobia, despite the size of the hallway. The area is dimly light by an orange light from outside, with long shadows and sharp visual contrast.
* The subject walks in either direction along the corridor for a long period of time, usually measuring several hours. During this time they report seeing several pieces of regal furniture placed in the hallway, faded paintings on the walls, and several doors. If the subject attempts to open the doors, they will find them barred from the opposite side, and report a foul smell beginning to emanate from behind.
* The subject encounters and converses with SCP-4116-1.

SCP-4116-1 is a recurring sapient entity located within instances of SCP-4116. The entity has been consistently described as an extremely emaciated and/or mummified elderly human male, wearing red regal robes and a simple golden crown nailed to the head. Subjects who claim to have seen additional portions of SCP-4116-1&#39;s body under the robes report similarly withered flesh and a thinly muscled build. Subjects have also described a tapestry consistent with medieval European crafting techniques stitched into the entity&#39;s torso. The details of the tapestry vary between cases, with subjects describing scenes such as a battle, a feast and a parade being depicted. In addition, SCP-4116-1 is described as having a long white beard and hair, and eye sockets extending unnaturally deep into the skull. 44% of reports also include SCP-4116-1 carrying one of several tools or accessories, usually described as some form of bladed implement, culinary utensil or simple mechanical device.

SCP-4116-1 is seemingly aware of its nature, and is able to recall details of past SCP-4116 instances and victims. Upon being encountered, SCP-4116-1 will usually speak to the subject before they awaken, seemingly referencing events that occurred within the prior forgotten dreams.

SCP-4116-1 has repeatedly demonstrated several sociopathic personality traits, including narcissism and lack of empathy. The entity believes itself to hold regal dominion over dreams, particularly nightmares. SCP-4116-1 also displays a warped set of values, regarding humans as raw material for unspecified purposes, and as wholly disposable for the sake of these purposes. Expanding upon this, SCP-4116-1 seems to have no concept of permanent death, simply referring to such as &#34;waking up&#34;, suggesting that it has little to no familiarity with existence outside of SCP-4116.

A cumulative log of all recovered conversations[[footnote]]As remembered by subjects. Due to this, statements may not be exact, however subjects report memories of SCP-4116 to be exceptionally vivid.[[/footnote]] with SCP-4116-1 is included here:

&gt; **SCP-4116-1:** Truly disappointing. I was barely able to craft a single one of my kin from your mind. And the bile wine came out dull. Begone from my sight, peasant.
&gt; 
&gt; **Antonio Giourard:** What? Jesus, who are you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4116-1:** Did you not hear me? No wonder even my skill couldn&#39;t make anything of your ears.  I said begone. I will find those who are better suited to serve my kingdom. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Antonio Giourard:** I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4116-1:** Do not apologize to me, apologize to my kingdom for failing to provide for it.

&gt; **SCP-4116-1:** Marvelous! Utterly marvelous! I&#39;ve half a mind to knight you here. What sort of torture must you undergo in your waking kingdom, to provide such horrors? I thought such things could only be found within my domain.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-10334:** What the h- Nope. No. This ain&#39;t normal.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4116-1:** Indeed, meat rarely earns such praise. I stalled the dawn long as I could, but alas, our time has come to an end. I will fondly remember the sweet tang of your liver. The banquet wouldn&#39;t have been the same without it.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-10334:** Uh huh. Yeah. I think I&#39;m gonna tell the docs about this one, and they&#39;re gonna find a way to haul you outta here, and we&#39;ll see who&#39;s laughing then.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4116-1:** A chance to meet such skilled torturers, such invokers of fear and despair? Perhaps it has been too long since I last crossed borders. Tell your doctors to prepare a feast in my honor. Several of your infants should suffice.

&gt; **SCP-4116-1:** There are no words I could use to describe how useless you are. Even if I could, your feeble, mewling mind likely couldn&#39;t understand me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Jean Ducrois:** Pardon? I don&#39;t understand. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4116-1:** What use is material that crumbles? What use is food that makes my subjects ill? I desperately wish that your mind was strong enough to remember the events of the night, so that you would suffer for the crime of poisoning my people.
&gt; 
&gt; **Jean Ducrois:** I haven&#39;t… I haven&#39;t hurt anyone. What are you on about?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4116-1:** Your blood simmers with an ailment, passed on to those who fed upon it. Their faces pale, their stomachs empty after spitting up bile. Their only condolence is knowing that while they are strong enough to survive, one day this disease will bring your end.

&gt; **Jenny Santsen:** Wh-What? Oh god, I must be dreaming.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4116-1:** My, you are //perceptive//. I am truly //astonished// by your mental prowess. I shouldn&#39;t be surprised, your brain was soft enough I could pull it out through the nose. Saved me much trouble splitting skulls.

&gt; **Jenny Santsen:** I-I&#39;m not afraid of you. You&#39;re just a dream.

&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sambre:** So the night terrors were a buildup to SCP-4116. And you must be SCP-4116-1.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4116-1:** I will not be reduced to a mere number. Numbers are reserved for those that your order imprison and experiment upon. You will address me as &#34;Your Majesty&#34;. And to think I had such high hopes for you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sambre:** I apologize, &#34;Your Majesty&#34;. What were you hoping for, exactly?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4116-1:** I was hoping to add any of your number to my court. Alas, you do not create the fear that I seek, only manipulate it. There was plenty to harvest within you, but the true shining knights of agony and horror remain in your world, beyond the reach of my palace. Locked in their shiny cages, their potential unrecognized!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sambre:** ...You are referring to the other anomalies, correct?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4116-1:** Aye, my kindred spirits in the waking world! The nightmares I forge here are many, but they are but serfs of the kingdom. But waking nightmares, that even the dawn cannot escape? They are worthy of being added to my court!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sambre:** I&#39;m afraid we have to keep them where they are. The ones I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re interested in are all quite dangerous. Besides, you&#39;ve shown no indication that you can interact with the physical world. You appear to be quite confined to your &#34;kingdom&#34;.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4116-1:** Then I shall expand my borders.

**Addendum 1:** Following the discoveries made on 8/16/2009, several personnel suffering from night terrors were issued mnestics in an attempt to potentially recover suppressed information on SCP-4116. One of these personnel was D-50042, who was confirmed to have been a victim of SCP-4116. A transcript of these events has been included below:

&gt; 
&gt; //D-50042 is seated at a table, with an additional audio recorder, notebook and pencil in front of him to record any recalled information. Agent Scott has been assigned to security, and is standing in the corner of the room reading a book. Dr. Sambre is overseeing the test, and hands D-50042 the mnestic pill, which he then consumes.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sambre:** All right, let us know when you start to feel it take effect. If you remember anything, either write it down or speak into the microphone, just make sure you get everything you can down.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-50042:** Yeah, alright. Quick question: why the hell are we tryna make me //remember// my nightmares? I&#39;d rather not, I&#39;m still sweaty from when I woke up.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sambre:** Well, you might have had a very specific dream, one that we need to know more about. We&#39;ll know shortly.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-50042:** Hoo, I can taste breakfast again. Either it&#39;s working or I&#39;m gonna throw up.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sambre:** That means it&#39;s working. Can you continue?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-50042:** Gah. Not gonna yak, but a bit of a headache. I&#39;m seeing some sorta... hallway? It&#39;s orange?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sambre:** That&#39;s SCP-4116! D-50042, please continue.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-50042:** Okay, okay... Hell, I wish you&#39;d warned me about the side effects. My head is killing me. Okay, I&#39;m, uhh, sliding down the hallway? No, I&#39;m being dragged by some... nasty mummy guy in a bathrobe. Don&#39;t like that very much. He&#39;s jabbering on about something, &#39;bout how he&#39;s going to use me to... make something? Seems excited.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sambre:** Interesting, we&#39;ve heard 4116-1 claim to use people to fabricate things, but we&#39;ve never had a memory of it. Do you remember what happened next in your dream?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-50042:** Oh hell, I&#39;m starting to see why this was a nightmare. He&#39;s hauling me into a room he opened, there were lotsa doors in the hall and he opened one. It&#39;s dark, can&#39;t see what&#39;s inside yet, but phew, I can smell it. Aw- love of god, I&#39;m not saying anything else until I get an aspirin. Nnff.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Scott:** You okay there?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-50042:** Gkk.
&gt; 
&gt; //A muffled crack can be heard throughout the room. The lights flicker briefly.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-50042:** Aaagh.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Scott:** Something&#39;s wrong- we&#39;ve got to get out of here!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sambre:** No, stay calm. We need this information-
&gt; 
&gt; //Another crack can be heard, sharper than the last. D-50042&#39;s eyes roll back in his head, and the lights flicker again.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Scott:** Dammit, we&#39;re leaving! Now!
&gt; 
&gt; **D-50042:** Hrgl. King.
&gt; 
&gt; //A third crack is heard, and the top of D-50042&#39;s head splits open. A metallic edge can be seen jutting out from the wound briefly before withdrawing back into the skull. The lights fail for several seconds, and upon reactivating emit a flickering orange light instead. A desiccated hand is now visible, emerging from the opening in D-50042&#39;s skull and attempting to pry the wound further open. Security cameras fail, and no more footage is obtained.//
&gt; 
&gt; [END LOG]

Agent Scott and Dr. Sambre escaped unharmed to a security checkpoint. Upon reentry to the testing room, D-50042&#39;s cadaver was found with the head split completely open and deep scratch marks covering the inside of the skull. The door had been forced open, how this was accomplished is unknown due to the failure of the security cameras.

To date, no more documented instances of SCP-4116 have manifested.[[footnote]]Reclassification as Neutralized pending.[[/footnote]] On 11/27/2009, 4 days after the events documented above, a string of violent murders occurred overnight in the town of ███████, 16 kilometers from the testing site. A total of ██ fatalities occurred, and no culprit was apprehended. Investigation into potential correlation is ongoing.
