**Special Containment Procedures:** ##4f7ce3|**Research is ongoing to determine the nature of SCP-7229 and possible containment methods are being developed by the Foundation. At this time, there is no known method of fully containing SCP-7229.**## SCP-7229 is to be monitored at all times by a team of astrophysicists stationed at Area-08-C. All data related to SCP-7229 is to be classified as Level ##4f7ce3|**5**## and kept strictly confidential effective immediately. Any unauthorized disclosure of information related to SCP-7229 will be met with severe consequences. 

Any civilian individuals who disappear during the 4-day period of SCP-7229&#39;s effect are to be immediately reported to Foundation personnel for investigation, and cover stories must be disseminated to the public to explain the disappearance of influential figures. Individuals who have observed disappearances are to be administered Class-B amnestics to prevent the spread of knowledge of the anomaly. Due to the potential for SCP-7229 to affect Foundation personnel, all essential personnel is to remain on-site during SCP-7229, unless authorized by at least two Level 4 personnel.  

The Foundation has attempted to disrupt the anomaly by limiting travel and movement during SCP-7229 in specific regions, but this has so far been unsuccessful. 

Following the discovery of the correlation between SCP-7229 and an increased rate of global disappearances, the Foundation has concluded that immediate urgent action is required to counteract the effects of SCP-7229. Due to the public being aware of the need for leap years to adjust for a slightly longer year, the Foundation has been obscuring the true reason for the need for leap years and maintaining the status quo of public knowledge to prevent any potential social disruption via containing the knowledge of its existence. Efforts have also been made to ensure that all historical records and scientific literature on the topic of leap years are consistent with the misinformation campaign. 

In the event that SCP-7229&#39;s effects become noticeable to the general public, a cover story must be disseminated to explain the changes in the Earth&#39;s orbit around the sun and a new explanation for leap years must be devised.

##4f7ce3|**Addendum:**##

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ [Open File:] &#34; hide=&#34;- [Close File:]&#34; hideLocation=&#34;both&#34;]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]

##4f7ce3|**Exactly 365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes, and 9 seconds. A typical year, like any other. One extra day every 4 years except when the year is evenly divisible by 100 but not 400. Time is a funny thing. My name is Sara Kim. As a Foundation researcher, I spent a significant amount of time studying the intricacies of space-time and its effects on the world around us.**##

##4f7ce3|**And as a child, I spent a significant amount of time being fascinated by the night sky. Staring up at the stars, I would dream of something bigger, something beyond our everyday lives, beyond our comprehension. That fascination never left me. And so I pursued a career in astrophysics, hoping to uncover the secrets of the universe about space, time, and the world that surrounded us.**##

##4f7ce3|**Then, when I was just 24 years old, I was hired by the Foundation. As a junior researcher, I was introduced to the world of anomalous objects and entities, and I was amazed by the scope and complexity of it all.  Back when I was a researcher working at 19, I was unprofessional, clumsy, always dropping stuff, forgetting deadlines, messing up projects, and getting injured by birds (don’t ask), but I was happy. So many hidden things, now revealed. So many impossibilities, now made possible. That urge to discover, that urge to learn more and more about the world had finally been fulfilled.**##

##4f7ce3|**Over the years I got better at my job. I worked my way up through the ranks, becoming a full-fledged senior researcher and then a supervisor. And then, I was approached with an opportunity to work at Area-08-C. It was a chance to work with some of the brightest minds in the field of astrophysics, to tackle some of the most challenging anomalies the Foundation had ever encountered. I jumped at the chance, and over the years, once again, I climbed through the ranks, eventually becoming a site director. It was a position of great responsibility, but it was also an opportunity to make a real difference in the world. And that’s all I cared about. But no matter how high I climbed, no matter how much I achieved, I never forgot that sense of wonder I had as a child, looking up at the night sky. And that dream, that something bigger, after so many years, I finally found it, or rather, it found me.**##

##4f7ce3|**Every four years, a powerful entity attempts to breach into our world from another dimension. This entity&#39;s power is so immense that it weakens the fabric of reality and the space-time continuum, this causes the flow of time around Earth to momentarily slow down. We slow down alongside it, so we don’t feel this, but it amounts to the Earth’s Orbit around the sun going ever so slightly off-sync. 0.2425 days a year off-sync, to be precise. I’d like to take a moment to thank Julius Caesar, Sosigenes of Alexandria, and the countless other scholars and scientists that contributed to the creation of the Julian Calendar. They noticed something odd about the seasons, something that didn&#39;t quite add up, they saw a problem and sought to fix it, and so they did. They thought they figured it all out, but little did they know, their efforts would inadvertently help the Foundation centuries later. We’ve been able to keep SCP-7229 from public consciousness and protect the Veil for much longer than we might have otherwise thanks to them.**##

##4f7ce3|**And we can take a moment to thank them every four years when we are merely at the clutches of this thing. Earlier, I said “attempt” to breach into our world, but in reality, it has succeeded in doing so time and time and time again. Every cycle, more people are pulled away from this world and into its own. Why it does this is currently unknown. What it does with the people it captures is, once again, unknown. Why the entity even operates on a four-year cycle to begin with? That remains a mystery. As to why time is slowing down? Well, at first we thought it was through the direct conscious effort of the entity and sought to correct it. But as time went on, we realized it came simply as a consequence of its mere presence, and any attempt to mitigate this effect without tackling the source would have been futile.**##

##4f7ce3|**But there is something that we know for certain, and that is the fact that it is getting stronger, and eventually it will be strong enough to completely consume our world, leaving nothing but an empty void in its wake. And after our world, the next, until the entirety of existence is destroyed and then… we’re not sure. Perhaps it will lay dormant, satisfied with its work, maybe it will ascend to a higher plane above even ours, in order to continue with its reign of destruction. Until then, however, we continue to search for an answer, for a way to stop it.**##

##4f7ce3|**And so we researched, day after day, all day and all night just banging our heads against the desk trying to figure something out. One of our investigators got word of a cult that had info about this thing. They were banished from their communities, shunned, called heretics. They had professed of its coming and so the entire cult was centered around it. They did not worship it, however. They had no rituals to venerate it, no sacrifices were ever made in its name. They did not adore this entity, they feared it. They knew it would not be satisfied with anything and so they sought in vain to keep it at bay for however long they could, even for just long enough to live out their lives. And now, that task is up to us.**##

.

##4f7ce3|**I suppose then,**##

.

.

##4f7ce3|**that after all that time of staring at the night sky,**##

.

.

.

##4f7ce3|**It was only a matter of time before, eventually,**##

.

.

.

.

##4f7ce3|**It would stare right back.**##
