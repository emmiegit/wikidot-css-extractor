**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6974 is to be contained in a unmodified storage locker on Site-19 along with 1 (one) heavily padded camera case for SCP-6974 to be placed into when not in use. Access to SCP-6974 is allowed by any couple (see Description) with at least Level One Access. D-class personnel can request access to SCP-6974 at any time and said requests must be approved by Dr. Anselm before use. SCP-6974 is to be stored with at least 5 (five) rolls of 116 Roll Film (eight 6.5cm x 11cm exposures per roll) placed inside of SCP-6974 camera case. If SCP-6974&#39;s current film roll is full, the film is required to be developed by Dr. Anselm and placed into the lobby of the containment area for pickup by site personnel. Any wear or damage to SCP-6974&#39;s external components is to be reported directly to Dr. Anselm for replacement. 

**Discovery and Acquisition**: SCP-6974 was discovered by routine internet sweeping protocols on August 2nd, 20██, when a reddit user &#34;cameraLevoure98&#34; reported taking a picture with his girlfriend using his new vintage camera and being &#34;transported to a whole other dimension&#34;. Task Force Alpha was dispatched to recover SCP-6974 and administer amnesiacs to the couple after wiping the post from the internet forum via the user&#39;s own computer. The previous owner of SCP-6974 was a vintage antiques shop in Medina, Ohio, that has been in business for over 40 years. Attempts to discuss the camera&#39;s sale or acquisition with the shop owner has proven difficult as Mr. ████ has cited a failing memory and seemed agitated whenever SCP-6974 was brought up. Mr. ████&#39;s son (the current shopkeeper) tried explaining that the camera was Mr. ████ wife&#39;s before she passed away nearly 20 years ago, and that Mr. ████ could never get it to work &#34;as well as she did.&#34; Mr. ████&#39;s son stated that his father sold it a few years back so that &#34;someone else could get it working again.&#34; Investigation into Mr. ████ and his wife are pending O5 approval.

**Description:** SCP-6974 is a Zeiss-Ikon Icarette 500/15 camera with a Carl Zeiss Jena 11.5 cm f/4.5 uncoated Anastigmat 4 elements lens. SCP-6974 was created the summer of 1930 in Dresden, Germany by the former camera manufacturer Zeiss-Ikon. 

When SCP-6974 is used to capture a photograph of a &#34;couple&#34;, referred to as SCP-6974-A and SCP-6974-B, the camera emits a &#34;flash&#34; with no discernable origin from the camera. Spectroscopic analysis of the light shows that it is indistinguishable from that produced by a magnesium based flashbulb. This &#34;flash event&#34; can be seen by anything witnessing the picture being taken. Reports state that the &#34;flash event&#34; fills the entire field of vision of the viewer, even when witnessed behind tinted glass or slatted metal. Even though the &#34;flash&#34; of similar intensity produced by a light source would undoubtedly burn a viewer&#39;s retinas, viewers report no pain or loss of sight afterward. Cameras and recording equipment are met with similar results. 

The &#34;flash&#34; event only occurs with couples. It is unknown how SCP-6974 determines who is &#34;together&#34; and who is not. Researchers Gideon and Marylu, who are both single and unaware of each other before testing, were placed in front of SCP-6974 and attempted to take a picture as &#34;just friends&#34;. SCP-6974 emitted no &#34;flash&#34; event and the developed film showed no extraneous lighting. Researchers Gideon and Marylu (with previous planning) then declared they would like to take each other on a date somewhere nice. After repositioning themselves in front of SCP-6974, another photo was taken and a &#34;flash&#34; event occurred. 

It is possible that SCP-6974 is sentient and can distinguish couples on verbal willingness or feelings of attraction. However, any ability to prove SCP-6974&#39;s sentience has failed due to the inability to get SCP-6974 to react to internal or external stimuli. The only known communication from SCP-6974 is a &#34;THANK YOU&#34; written in the sky during the firework show every night within the amusement park. 

During the &#34;flash&#34; event, SCP-6974-A and SCP-6974-B are instantaneously transported to an unknown reality, referred to SCP-6974-C, in which SCP-6974-A and SCP-6974-B are placed in front of an entrance to an impossibly large amusement park. Testing has shown the park to be at least  1,237,943km x 1,237,943km x  5,356,123km in size with no discernable curvature to the horizon where there would otherwise be, enabling SCP-6974-A and SCP-6974-B to see as far as eyes or visual equipment will allow. 

When SCP-6974-A or SCP-6974-B wish to leave, they are instantaneously transported out of SCP-6974-C to the spot they were standing when the photo was taken. To outside observers, SCP-6974-A or SCP-6974-B will rearrange their orientation after the flash event but not move or disappear, while SCP-6974-A or SCP-6974-B will be actively transported to (and spend time inside of) SCP-6974-C. All items and objects on SCP-6974-A or SCP-6974-B are transported with them to SCP-6974-C, as well as any objects or items acquired while in SCP-6974-C will be transported back with them. However, any objects or items left in SCP-6974-C are reportedly &#34;cleaned up&#34; after SCP-6974-A and SCP-6974-B leave.
 
SCP-6974-C follows a 24 hour day/night cycle that correlates directly to CST, UTC-5:00 upon the start of the &#34;flash&#34; event. The amusement park will change lighting and activities based on the time of &#34;day&#34;. Although there is no &#34;Sun&#34;, stars are visible in the night sky and appear to be significantly larger and / or closer than our Milky Way. However, the stars that are seen correlate to no known star patterns and seemingly randomize their static positions at the start of every night. 

SCP-6974-A and SCP-6974-B are able to enter the park and enjoy whatever they wish for as long as they want. There are no other guests or any form of park employees, all rides operate themselves or are on schedules, any food or drink kiosks dispense items automatically on conveyors with no visible method of creation, and &#34;carnival games&#34; dispense prizes automatically if games are won. 

Attempting to cheat at carnival games results in the booth &#34;timing out&#34; with a message displaying &#34;Under Maintenance&#34;. If SCP-6974-A and SCP-6974-B are to lose each other, blank signs will appear throughout the amusement park with arrows pointing toward paths to find their partner. Attempting to damage rides or operating elements beyond repair results in immediate expulsion from SCP-6974-C. Attempting to harm SCP-6974-A or SCP-6974-B in any way results in immediate expulsion from SCP-6974-C. Any &#34;damage&#34; dealt to SCP-6974-A or SCP-6974-B is impossible while in SCP-6974-C. SCP-6974-A and SCP-6974-B cannot starve while in SCP-6974-C, but SCP-6974-A and SCP-6974-B can report feeling &#34;a bit peckish&#34; after not eating for some time. SCP-6974-A and SCP-6974-B also report never feeling &#34;worn out&#34; or &#34;tired&#34; while in SCP-6974-C, but will still take naps with their partner on benches or rides that are reportedly &#34;relaxing&#34;.

**Exploration Video Log Transcript**

**Date:** September 7th, 20██

**Exploration Team:** &#34;First Date&#34; 

**Subject:** SCP-6974-C, Initial Contact

**Team Lead:** Researcher Luna Sidhara

**Team Members:** Researcher Theuda Tevar
-----

[BEGIN LOG]

//Both Researchers are outside the Camera range, preparing equipment//

**Luna Sidhara:** Radio Check. Checking data drives and video recorders. 

**Theuda Tevar:** Radio Check. Data looks good. Is the gun necessary though? I&#39;ve never known you to carry a gun into research.

**Luna Sidhara:** I&#39;m not about to find out that there are unwelcome guests. These endless anomalies give me the creeps.

**Theuda Tevar:** Alright fair enough. Ready to go when you are. 

//Luna and Theuda Shuffle in front of the camera//

**Luna Sidhara:** Alright, reiteration of &#34;couple&#34; testing. I am not engaged in a relationship with Theuda Tevar. I am single and have no intention of dating.

**Theuda Tevar:**  I am not engaged in a relationship with Luna Sidhara. I am single and have no intention of dating.

//Luna sets the autotimer for SCP-6974 and returns to position with Theuda. SCP-6974 emits a ticking noise as it&#39;s internal timing mechanism clicks down, and finally a shutter sound goes off.//

**Luna Sidhara:** No issues for me. Camera operating as normal. No reality shifting or anomaly detected. Anything on your end? 

**Theuda Tevar:** Nope.

**Luna Sidhara:** Alright. Lets head in then. Theuda Tevar, would you agree to going out sometime?

**Theuda Tevar:** Luna Sidhara, yes I would. 

//Luna and Theuda Awkwardly shake hands. Luna resets the timing mechanism and returns to position. SCP-6974 re-engages it&#39;s timing mechanism and clicks down. As the shutter clicks, a &#34;flash&#34; event occurs and the cameras positioned on Luna and Theuda now show SCP-6974-C.//

**Luna Sidhara:** Flash confirmed. Wow, this place feels even bigger in person. 

**Theuda Tevar:** Woah, look at that roller coaster!

//The camera pans up to see an enormous coaster, one of many spread through out the enormous grounds. Replay analysis confirms at least 17 loops, 5 upside-down curls, 7 upward and downward spirals, and one &#34;T-Rex&#34; with a rail going inside of it.//

**Luna Sidhara:** Alright, lets take base of our surroundings. 

//Luna swings the camera around the entrance. Luna and Theuda are transported onto the cobblestone steps laid out in front of the &#34;entrance&#34;. Behind them is another &#34;entrance&#34; and connecting the two is a beige stone wall on either side. Later analysis confirms that this is the only known area of the park that is made for &#34;entering&#34; SCP-6974-C. Luna and Theuda approach the entrance and begin the expedition.//

**Theuda Tevar:** Hey I just noticed something, it&#39;s supposed to be 2:00pm right? Do you see the sun?

**Luna Sidhara:** No, I guess not. We both have shadows too. It&#39;s also really nice out, has to be at least 72F. 

**Theuda Tevar:** Alright, well. What do we want to try first. 

**Luna Sidhara:**  I&#39;m going to save food and drinks for last, lets see what kind of rides there are. 

**Theuda Tevar:** Ooh can we look for a splash mountain? I love water rides!

**Luna Sidhara:** We have Camera equipment... Lets stick to dry rides. 

//Luna and Theuda walk in one direction for approximately a mile. The twists and turns of the paths are fairly standard for amusement parks, with branches going off in different directions with signs for names of areas such as &#34;Forest&#39;s Trail&#34;, &#34;Tropical Peaks&#34;, &#34;Sci-Fi Wonderland&#34;, &#34;Futurefun&#34;, &#34;Lunar Escapades&#34;, &#34;Rainy-River&#34;, &#34;Toontown&#34;, and many more. Every game booth and ride is active and running, filling the park with the clamorous sounds of machinery and music//

**Theuda Tevar:** Alright, it just keeps going. I think we&#39;re clear to start trying some of the rides. I saw a sign for something called &#34;Lunar Escapades&#34;, should we check it out?

**Luna Sidhara:** Sure. Feels kinda weird that nobody else is around. Who runs the games, or the rides for that matter. They need maintenance right? 

**Theuda Tevar:** Everything looks brand new too. Even the roller coasters. No rust or trash anywhere. Plus, no lines!

//Luna and Theuda retrace their steps to the Lunar Escapade section. Nothing out of the ordinary is seen while in this new section. Rides and booths look &#34;Moon themed&#34;, with prizes being anything from &#34;moon candy&#34; to &#34;alien plushies&#34;.// 

**Theuda Tevar:** Lets try this shooting gallery. Looks easy enough

**Luna Sidhara:** We get to keep it after command analyze it right? That alien looks super cute. 

**Theuda Tevar:** Maybe. 

**Luna Sidhara:** &#34;Moonar Run&#34;. Hmm... does it have instructions?

**Theuda Tevar:** You aim the toy laser gun at the targets... Have you been to a carnival before?

**Luna Sidhara:**  I... no. I have not. I&#39;ve been at Site-19 for almost 15 years, I feel like I&#39;ve had more than enough fun with trying not to die that I never really thought about it. 

**Theuda Tevar:** Well, try to have some fun! 

//Theuda and Luna go start the game and play through without issue. The toy laser guns made little &#34;pew&#34; noises as they fired. When targets are &#34;hit&#34;, there is an &#34;explosion&#34; sound while the points add up by 100 each. At the end, the score is 5,400-1,500. The screen above Luna says &#34;Congratulations!&#34; and a prize is dropped from the rack into Luna&#39;s arms.//

**Luna Sidhara:** It&#39;s so soft... Do... Do we have to bag and tag it? It could be dangerous right? Like.. Filled with human remains... or nanobots in the fur... or is it about to come alive and eat me?

**Theuda Tevar:** It&#39;s literally a stuffed alien. Does it have a company tag? Like made in China or anything?

**Luna Sidhara:** I don&#39;t see anything. We&#39;ll let command analyze it later. 

//Luna places the stuffed toy into her rucksack. Later Analysis shows the toy being made with generic cotton and synthetic materials with similar molecular composition to our reality. No anomalous properties observed.//

**Theuda Tevar:** What happens if you try to take down a prize yourself?

//Theuda tries to yank a prize off the rack. It doesn&#39;t move and appears to be attached by more than just the visible hook in the back of the toy. After unsuccessfully trying to move the toy for over a minute, the electronic display says &#34;under maintenance&#34;. This message doesn&#39;t go away for approx. one minute.//

**Luna Sidhara:** Hahaha, why did you try to remove it so hard? You looked frenzied.

**Theuda Tevar:** Hey shush! I&#39;m motivated ok. I didn&#39;t expect it to lock up the booth. 

**Luna Sidhara:** Hey.. how long have we been here? 

**Theuda Tevar:** My clock says 3 hours and 14 minutes. 

**Luna Sidhara:** Do you feel tired? Or hungry? Or even thirsty? 

**Theuda Tevar:** I guess I could go for a snack, but otherwise no. 

**Luna Sidhara:** Keep an eye on it. Lets see what this thing offers for food. 

//Luna and Theuda take a look around for concessions. Every area had themed food items and areas. Everything from generic carnival food to specifically themed restaurants within areas. Notable items are as follows; every area theme followed by &#34;Burgers&#34; (Moon Burgers, Tropical Burgers, Wild Burgers,  Toon Burgers, etc), drinks that are molecularly similar to Coke products, a single stand that claimed to have &#34;Turkey Legs&#34; that were approximately five times bigger than normal Turkey legs, restaurants with amazingly detailed and hand crafted sets for the local theme, and one &#34;Dippin&#39; Dots&#34; stand.//

**Theuda Tevar:** Ok so... this is a conveyer that leads into nothing. It&#39;s literally a flap coming out of a flat wall. I can&#39;t reach behind the glass to get a closer look, should we try breaking it open?

**Luna Sidhara:** No, I don&#39;t want to find out what happens when if we break the park rules too much. Is it still dispensing food?

**Theuda Tevar:** Yeah, I ordered 100 &#34;Toon Burgers&#34; and they&#39;re still just coming out. Every single one looks fresh and well made. I think it&#39;s nearing 60 so far.

**Luna Sidhara:** I vacuum sealed one for base. At the very least it&#39;ll go in the breakroom fridge.  

**Theuda Tevar:** Well, they taste //really// good. I think I like them more than the Lunar Burgers. It says here they come with &#34;toon sauce&#34;, whatever that is. 

**Luna Sidhara:** I wish you hadn&#39;t eaten them before the lab got through analysis.. 

**Theuda Tevar:** Oh //come onnnnn//, it&#39;s obvious this thing isn&#39;t going to hurt us. 

**Luna Sidhara:** Protocol states that- 

**Theuda Tevar:** Protocol my ass. Yes I know we&#39;re recording. This saves the foundation another trip into this thing to make some poor D-class eat &#39;till they explode. If nothing else, I expect a commendation for my bravery. 

**Luna Sidhara:** (silence)

**Theuda Tevar:** Anyway, I think that&#39;s all we can do at this point. I&#39;m not sure what-

//Loud fireworks are heard outside of the restaurant, shaking the building.//

**Luna Sidhara:** What the f-

**Theuda Tevar:** Wait are we missing the fireworks?!

**Luna Sidhara:** I don&#39;t-

**Theuda Tevar:** Come on! Quickly!

//Theuda and Luna go outside of the restaurant and check on the fireworks. They seem to be going off within every 5 square km of the park, and include Chrysanthemums, Sparkles, Brocades, Dahlias, Stars, Peony, Pistils, Whisles, Willows, and many more shapes and sizes. After approximately 20 minutes there is a final firework that spells out &#34;THANK YOU&#34; in bright blue sparkles, ending the display//

**Luna Sidhara:** And... time marked. Geez... we&#39;ve been here nearly 8 hours. 

**Theuda Tevar:** Did you enjoy it?

**Luna Sidhara:** I-uh... Yes. The last time I saw fireworks was when I was a kid. Never really liked explosions but the effects were pretty. 

**Theuda Tevar:** The stars are really pretty too don&#39;t you think?

**Luna Sidhara:** They&#39;re misshapen and slightly off color too. Almost looks like a display or like.. really close stars. I&#39;ll take a few pictures and send them to-

**Theuda Tevar:** (silence)

**Luna Sidhara:** Oh- I uh.. yes. The stars are beautiful. 

**Theuda Tevar:** There we go ya big softie. I think we have enough for command. 

//Luna reaches into her bag and takes out the stuffed alien from it&#39;s sealed container//

**Luna Sidhara:** I.. I think I&#39;m going to hold onto this. Ya know.. for analysis. 

**Theuda Tevar:** I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. Ready to go?

**Luna Sidhara:** Yeah. I&#39;m ready. 

//Luna and Theuda arrived back into Site-19 standing in the same spot they were before. Luna is holding a stuffed alien while Luna and Theuda are looking at eachother instead of the camera. Outside observers report the flash event only occurring for about 1ms. Watches and timers located on Theuda and Luna report the passing of time anyway. Questions on this assignment can be directed to Luna and Theuda&#39;s newly made joint research office on floor 3.//

**Interviewed:** Luna Sidhara, Expedition Team Leader for SCP-6974

**Interviewer:** Site Director ██████

**Foreword:** ██████ is interviewing subjects following the expedition into SCP-6974 to determine if being inside of the anomaly has produced anomalous effects in the relationship between two researchers. ██████ has detained Luna Sidhara 6 days after the expedition into SCP-6974 due to the motion to reclassify SCP-6974 as safe to use for all on site. Being a very unusual request, the O5 council has requested that ██████ determine if there has been an effect on staff from SCP-6974 and to follow up on the motion for free use of SCP-6974. 

**&lt;Begin Log, 14:56&gt;**

**██████** :: Hello Ms. Sidhara. How are you feeling today?

**Luna Sidhara** :: Who are you? Why am I being detained?

**██████** :: My apologies, my name is ██████. These are precautionary security measures until we can determine if we have accounted for SCP-6974&#39;s real anomalous property. As you could probably understand, allowing free use of a rather new SCP on such a short time frame is rather... unusual, and more often than not is the cause of a secondary &#34;undiscovered&#34; anomalous property. I&#39;ve been sent to make sure we have all our bases covered here. 

**Luna Sidhara** :: Isn&#39;t Dr. Anselm supposed to be the one that follows up on things like this?

**██████** :: Dr. Anselm is currently being interviewed as well. However, we are particularly interested in you due to your new... work priorities. 

**Luna Sidhara** :: Oh, this is about my request for a joint research office with Researcher Theuda?

**██████** :: In a way, yes. That and your new relationship with said researcher, and the fact that you have stolen research items from containment to keep for personal use. 

**Luna Sidhara** :: How-

**██████** :: It is my job to keep tabs on everyone on site. Especially things you //don&#39;t// want us to know. Those end up being the most important //and// the most dangerous. I want to emphasize that you aren&#39;t in trouble, as long as you can answer our questions truthfully and our memetic sensors don&#39;t detect anything unusual. 

**Luna Sidhara** :: Um... ok.

**██████** :: Lets begin then. Luna Sidhara, you were born in Tampa, Florida in 1993. You achieved rather high marks in all areas of study, eventually continuing to higher education where you acquired two Master Degrees in chemical and mechanical engineering. The foundation picked you up not too long ago and you have been rising through the researcher ranks by your outstanding devotion to detail and analysis. You are currently working on a doctoral case study of.. sorry how do you say this?

**Luna Sidhara** :: Keter-class entities that use Non-Euclidian Space.

**██████** :: Right. You have never had a significant other, you have had little to no friends over your years of working at the foundation, you show lack of interest in any area that isn&#39;t data analytics and have continuously volunteered for menial-

**Luna Sidhara** :: I get it. I&#39;m a anti-social nerd. Is this an interview or a roast?

**██████** :: Apologies if I touched a nerve, I just want to make sure my information is correct. 

**Luna Sidhara** :: So far. 

**██████** :: Most of your research has been on temporal or space-warping SCPs, so what made you want to research SCP-6974?

**Luna Sidhara** :: Um... I don&#39;t know. I guess I wanted to try something a little different.
&gt;
**██████** :: Ms. Sidhara, please be aware I can tell when you are lying. Would you like to answer again?

**Luna Sidhara** :: (Pauses) Fine. Theuda Tevar asked me to participate in the project.

**██████** :: Can you please describe your timeline with Theuda?

**Luna Sidhara** :: Don&#39;t you know already?

**██████** :: Yes. Please answer for the record. 

**Luna Sidhara** :: Ugh... you guys are the worst. Look, Theuda and I had worked on a few earlier projects and ate lunch together sometimes. That&#39;s all. It&#39;s not some big secret that we were friends.

**██████** :: And before entering the anomaly, you had no feelings of intent for Theuda?

**Luna Sidhara** :: (silence)

**██████** :: Ms. Sidhara...

**Luna Sidhara** :: Please don&#39;t make me say it. 

**██████** :: For the record, please.

**Luna Sidhara** :: Yes, the //permanent, undeletable record that the entire facility has access to.// Ok look, she&#39;s a good friend ok? I kind of realized while we were in that park that there are a lot of things she does for me that I didn&#39;t even realize. Things that I kind of take for granted a lot and ignored. So, you tell me. 

**██████** :: Thank you. While you were in the anomaly, you clearly stated a few times that you were afraid of it before going in. All the other interviewers showed elevated signs of stress and fear while inside the anomaly. What made you change your mind?

**Luna Sidhara** :: SCP-6974 has no ill intent. It&#39;s just a park. The food was analyzed to be perfectly safe, the-

**██████** :: Yes, analyzed //after// the fact. You are a researcher, you know well enough how many things look perfectly normal until they //aren&#39;t//, you broke substantial protocols that are in place to keep you //safe// and are now requesting that everyone on site break them for fun. Is that not a little weird to you? 

**Luna Sidhara** :: I guess when you put it like that, sure. We were there for almost 12 hours and Team Kai-7 Theta was there for 318 days, why aren&#39;t they being reprimanded for eating their weight in turkey legs every night?

**██████** :: Team Kai-7 didn&#39;t steal research items from containment.

**Luna Sidhara** :: Right, the stuffed alien.

**██████** :: Can you please elaborate on why you kept it?

**Luna Sidhara** :: It was already analyzed and just sitting there. I won it at a carnival game, why wasn&#39;t I allowed to put it on my desk? 

**██████** :: It could be anomalous, or toxic, or memetic, or any number of things.

**Luna Sidhara** :: Ok yes but it was analyzed and-

**██████** :: This is not a reprimand, please don&#39;t feel the need to defend yourself. I understand //why// you kept it, we are just making sure there is no influence outside of normal behavior.

**Luna Sidhara** :: Don&#39;t make it sound weird. 

**██████** :: My job is to make everyone uncomfortable.

**Luna Sidhara** :: You&#39;re doing a bang up job.

**██████** :: Thank you. Now, why did you decide to open a recommendation for Theuda and yourself to create a join research lab within the site? You have shown no interest in working directly with researchers in the past, including Dr. Anselm.  

**Luna Sidhara** :: Refer to my previous answer.  

**██████** :: Fair enough. Why are you recommending SCP-6974 be designated safe for site staff?

**Luna Sidhara** :: Oh my GOD. Look, its a freekin&#39; PARK. There&#39;s nothing anomalous about it! I have 27 pages of research on this thing and it says the same thing! It&#39;s a cute amusement park meant for couples or living entities that wish to seek more in a relationship. That&#39;s it! If you //read// the damn proposal you&#39;ll see that it&#39;s already been giving every battery of tests we could think of //and more//. You want me to say it? Fine! **I like Theuda**, ok? The anomaly was nothing more than an excuse for us to finally go on a date, and it was great! Ya hear that Site-19? Jesus it&#39;s like trying to pull grenade pins out of a nuke with you people. Make one little proposal to have a joint research office with someone you like and suddenly its a site-wide nuclear detonation. 

**██████** :: Thank you.

**Luna Sidhara** :: Yeah whatever, can I go back to my office and lock the door now that everyone on site is going to read this. 

**██████** :: I think we have what we need. Please continue your research with SCP-6974, we will accept your safe-designation and joint research proposals today. 

**Luna Sidhara** :: Thanks. Anything else?

**██████** :: Yeah, uh, one personal one. How cute is the alien?

**Luna Sidhara** :: Cutest damn thing I&#39;ve ever seen.

**&lt;End Log, 15:13&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** ██████ has found no anomalous properties within the joint research team now leading SCP-6974&#39;s development. SCP-6974 will be designated safe and free to use by on-site staff. ██████ would also like to note that &#34;he really wants to get his wife one of those aliens.&#34;

Two D-Class personnel were placed in front of SCP-6974. Both D-class personnel were instructed to cause as much physical damage to themselves with a traditional steel knife once they entered SCP-6974-C, with the agreement that upon doing so they would have their sentence lessened upon return. After agreeing to &#34;date&#34; both D-Class personnel entered SCP-6974-C. Once they arrived in SCP-6974-C, both D-class personnel attempted to stab themselves with their knives as hard as they could. Neither knife penetrated skin and both D-Class personnel were immediately removed from SCP-6974-C.

Both personnel agreed to &#34;date&#34; and entered SCP-6974-C. Upon entering, Agent Wilt attempted to locate the previous test&#39;s knife in the welcome area without luck. As Agent Wilt did so, the D-class personnel escaped Agent Wilt&#39;s custody before the test could be administered and took off through SCP-6974-C. Agent Wilt attempted to search for the D-Class for over an hour before noticing that &#34;arrowed signs&#34; had appeared on the paths around the park. After following the signs, Agent Wilt found the D-class personnel hidden inside of a &#34;tropical themed&#34; restaurant. The test was administered and no bullet wounds were found on the D-class upon return.

Later analysis of the recording showed the two Terriers arriving in the same theme park. Both terriers explored the area and ate from the many concessions scattered around the park. After some time, both terriers curled up in the sun together and &#34;took a really cute nap&#34;. After both terriers woke up, they ate some more concessions, then seemed a to look around for their owner. At which point both terriers started whining and left SCP-6974-C shortly after.

Team Kai-7 Theta sent two members into SCP-6974-C with an autonomous unmanned drone capable of 267 km/h top speeds and enough rations to last 4 weeks. If the team&#39;s rations are depleted then it is up to the discretion of the Team Leader to continue testing with SCP-6974-C concessions. The drone stopped during &#34;day&#34; to recharge it&#39;s batteries via sunlight around it. Testing stopped after the team spent 318 days inside SCP-6974-C where the drone was able to cover 1,145,426 km of park.
