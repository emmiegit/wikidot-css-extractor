[[tab Personnel Profile]]
**Name:** Dr. Roy G. Caroll

**Security Clearance:** Level-2

**Occupation:** General researcher.

**History:** Dr. Caroll was recruited to the Foundation at 23 years of age. During this time, Caroll was still in university studying theoretical physics and zoology. Caroll then completed his degree while in Foundation employment with the assistance of research specialists. 

Dr. Caroll has been in Foundation employment for five years and is now age 28.

**Additional Information:** Dr. Caroll is currently undergoing investigation for possible anomalous abilities. The ability in question is the ability to attract and/or manifest organisms of the //Coccinellidae// family (ladybugs) at will.
&gt; **Researcher Note:** I&#39;m telling you, they just like me. Just because I always happen to have a stray ladybug on my shoulder, even while inside, doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m anomalous. Or, at least, I don&#39;t think so. But, hey, that would be pretty cool, right?
&gt; 
&gt; - Dr. Caroll

&gt; This was my first skip, and it was also a coldpost. On top of that, it was somehow successful. I thought of it when something like this ran through my mind: &#34;Aliens are cool. Why haven&#39;t we been taken over yet? They&#39;ve gotta exist... What if it&#39;s because they&#39;re incompetent?&#34; I was also listening to the Kendrick Lamar song showcased in the skip at the time of writing, and that&#39;s where &#34;rap-loving&#34; came from.

&gt; Roughly my fourth skip concept. I had thought of it because I wanted to write something about an arising conflict between the Church of the Broken God and the Sarkic Cults. Plus, Alaska. Who doesn&#39;t like Alaska? I mean, they don&#39;t have many ladybirds, but... you know. Alaska.

@@@@
&gt; This is my first space-based skip, and I was (and still am) really confident in the idea. It originally went through two renditions before the final one was posted onto the main site. It was inspired by the Solway Spaceman, and was encouraged by the 2001 film &#34;A Space Oddysey.&#34;

&gt; This is my entry for the Doomsday Contest as part of Team Mikasa consisting of [[*user stormbreath]], [[*user DrChandra]], [[*user Stallmantic]] and I. It&#39;s based in the War on All Fronts canon and explains the origins of the Crocosquid alongside its true Fifthist nature.

//Get put to sleep **by** the fishes.//
[[/module]]
&gt; My first Safe-class article. I wanted to write an article about fish food for some reason, and then [[*user Dr_Aers]] dropped me with the dreaming concept and I altered it to be a betta fish doll. Then the rest kind of wrote itself.

&gt; I always wanted to make an article about tinfoil hats. Truthfully, it started out as a -EX, but I just found it way too funny to make it serious 100% of the time. It&#39;s also my first ever attempted joke article.

//We are running out of food, heat, and, ironically, water.//
[[/module]]
&gt; This is the second to an upcoming series that I plan on making quite creepy. Big thanks to my friend Kyle for helping me with the concept! The prologue to this SCP is [[[Every Last Drop]]] and probably won&#39;t make sense unless you read that.

&gt; My first Series V article and quite a pleasure to make with Gears. I personally really like how this turned out and it&#39;s my longest skip to date. I always wanted to write about history, and the 4k Contest finally allowed me to get the creative juices flowing.

//We&#39;ll both miss her. Together.//
[[/module]]
&gt; My second Series V article which was written for creepy vibes. I had this idea in my head for a while now and finally decided to type it out and I&#39;m pretty satisfied with the final product. It&#39;s my first time trying to focus on scaring the audience, so I hope it managed to deliver.

//Er, stupid fucking mosquito.//

&gt; I created this article not long after reading another JamCon entry. Sometimes, we just look too deep into song lyrics, and this is what happens when Dr. Hammond himself falls into the spiral gestalt because of some song.

&gt; Another contest entry co-authored by [[*user Gabriel_Jade]]. I had a lot of fun  in this contest and I managed to learn a hell of a lot about writing, both independently and cooperatively, by working with the members of Team Inkblots. I really enjoyed writing this one alongside Jade and the concept that we managed to come up with tied in nicely with my want to create an article involving something creepy and crawly.

No, I&#39;m not Arabic. I just like the aesthetic of Arabic words, both in English and in Arabic.

Hello! I&#39;m [[*user DrCaroll]] and, while I have only been a member of this wiki for less than a month (at the time of writing this page), I&#39;ve been involved in the SCP community for about three and a half years now. Unlike the majority of people, I wasn&#39;t actually pulled in by SCP:CB; I didn&#39;t even know what that was three and a half years ago. 

I gained knowledge of this wonderful community through a roleplay server on Garry&#39;s Mod. Originally, I was just a D-Class, and so I had thought it was some sort of prison roleplay server. I still enjoyed it nonetheless. 

After that, I noticed there were monstrosities that I was taken to see. I had no idea what they were, and so I asked out-of-character. They, of course, replied with &#34;it&#39;s an SCP,&#34; and I googled this wiki. Through the wiki, I gained knowledge of SCP:CB. Gotta be honest, though: not really a fan.

I just continued to roleplay on Garry&#39;s Mod until I officially decided to join the wiki and contribute myself. I absolutely love this community, and I am always willing to help anyone with anything they might need help with. 

Don&#39;t be afraid to DM me if you have any inquiries! I&#39;m also Junior Staff on Forum Crit, so DM me if you have a draft that you would like reviewed.
