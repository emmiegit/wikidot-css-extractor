**Item #:** SCP-7238

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7238 is contained within a 15x15x15 meter reinforced concrete chamber at Site-81. Access to the chamber is permitted only to Level 3 personnel or higher. Security cameras monitor the chamber at all times. 

SCP-7238 is kept underneath a hermetically sealed steel vault weighing 5 tons when not undergoing study or testing. Vault integrity is to be verified weekly through x-ray scans. Any detected anomalies or damage must be reported immediately. 

Ten armed guards equipped with Type-III hazmat suits and anti-memetic countermeasures are stationed outside the vault entrance at all times. Use of lethal force is authorized to deter any potential breach of containment.

In the event of a containment failure, Site-81 is equipped with a specially designed electromagnetic pulse emitter located 1 kilometer from SCP-7238&#39;s chamber. The pulse is capable of neutralizing any effects of SCP-7238 within a 500 meter radius. Facility evacuation or countermeasures may still be required depending on the scope and nature of the failure.

**Description:** SCP-7238 is the collective designation given to anomalous residues and artifacts recovered from a buried structure located ████████, ███ during a routine archaeological excavation in ███. Analysis of the structure&#39;s architecture and artifacts indicate it originated from an unknown culture that predated all known human civilizations. 

The largest and central artifact recovered, henceforth referred to as SCP-7238-1, measures 3 meters in diameter and appears to be a circular stone tablet heavily inscribed with pictograms and geometric patterns. The inscriptions have resisted all attempts at translation or interpretation. SCP-7238-1 emits an unidentified electromagnetic field that causes mild disorientation and short-term memory loss in people within 30 meters if not shielded.

Smaller artifacts designated SCP-7238-2 through SCP-7238-30 consist of assorted statuettes, obsidian blades, and carved stone fragments also bearing untranslated inscriptions. These appear to serve no practical function and their exact purpose remains unclear. They exhibit similar but less potent anomalous effects on cognition and perception to 7238-1 when handled or brought near the face and torso. 

The most anomalous property of SCP-7238 is any residues originating directly from the buried structure, designated SCP-7238-R. Analysis shows 7238-R consists of microscopic crystalline structures and anomalous bacteria of unknown classification. When any living organism ingests, inhales, or absorbs 7238-R through an open wound, it begins exhibiting symptoms congruent with memetic or cognitive hazards within 24 hours. 

Affected subjects develop semantic satiation, loss of declarative memory, and suggestibility within 36 hours if not isolated and treated. Prolonged exposure often results in catatonia, coma, or ultimately death from organ failure within one week. The exact mechanism through which 7238-R affects cognition is still being researched. Its structure and molecular composition defy conventional classification schemes.

The anomalous properties of SCP-7238 suggest it originated from a deeply ancient and vastly advanced civilization that predated modern humanity. How such a civilization arose and fell without leaving any other historical or archaeological traces remains one of the Foundation&#39;s most profound mysteries. Continued study of SCP-7238 may offer new insights about the deep origins and prehistory of intelligent life on Earth.

** Addendum 7238-01: Experiment Log 0451-AC:** On ██/██/20██, D-5354 was exposed to a controlled aerosolized dose of SCP-7238-R totaling 0.5mg over the course of 1 hour under supervision of Dr. Barron and medical staff. Subject had no previous anomalous exposure or cognitive impairments at the time of testing. 

Initial symptoms of confusion and mild memory loss manifested 12 hours post-exposure as anticipated. However, subject&#39;s condition unexpectedly deteriorated rapidly overnight. By morning, D-5354 had become completely catatonic and unresponsive to all external stimuli. 

MRIs and EEGs revealed abnormal growths and neural pathways developing in regions associated with fear, aggression and primal urges. Subject went into respiratory failure and cardiac arrest while scanning. Efforts to resuscitate failed after 25 minutes.

Autopsy findings were even more anomalous and disturbing. The neurobiological changes extended throughout D-5354&#39;s entire central nervous system. Tissue samples examined under electron microscopy showed SCP-7238-R had directly infiltrated neurons and was in the process of [DATA EXPUNGED].

In light of these developments, exposure to any quantity of SCP-7238-R is henceforth forbidden without express clearance from 3 senior researchers and Dr. ████. Any further experiments involving human or animal subjects will need to utilize only trace amounts of inert samples in strictly controlled isolation chambers with life support overrides. Caution is advised.
