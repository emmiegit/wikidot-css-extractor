I don&#39;t like thinking about it man, that thing gives fucking hell, real hell. it saw me, the dumbass behind a wall, I watched a third of that thing&#39;s brain get blown off and he kept-

**Dr █████** So you&#39;ve said.

**Priv. ██████** Sorry, sir, but you-

**Dr █████** That isn&#39;t of importance, I would take your paid leave and just answer a few questions.

**Priv. ██████** Hit me.

**Dr █████** Since you&#39;ve already made this a very, very sloppy interview. How close was it when it began to attack you?

**Priv. ██████** about 60 feet, sorry, you want that your science terms, maybe 20 meters give or take.

**Dr █████** and you said it didn&#39;t look at you while shooting? interesting.

**Priv. ██████** It&#39;s almost like it sees the world from a top-down view, the way it fought was flawless... ██, it got ██ ██████, in █ minutes.

**Dr █████** thank you private that&#39;s all I want from you.

**Priv. ██████** Kill that damn thing and I&#39;ll accept your thanks.
