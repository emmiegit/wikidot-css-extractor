Sapient clowns. You&#39;ve heard about them, but are they really as good as people claim they are?

If you&#39;re reading over this now, chances are, you&#39;ve heard //[*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/levealuto-aston-promises-sapient-clowns-takeover Levealuto Aston&#39;s]// speech, or read a transcript of it. If not, you&#39;ll most likely be clueless on my following statements within this piece. My name is Rodrick Schaefer from //The Bozian Conservative™ [[footnote]] A conservative newspaper corporation in favor of preserving traditional practices and regulations within the clown industry. [[/footnote]]//, and I&#39;m writing this to state my opinions on sapient clowns.

**1. Sapient clowns and livestock clowns.**

In Aston&#39;s speech, he says how sapient clowns are in the same family as livestock clowns, which is //technically// correct. Sapient clowns can form their own ideas and mindsets, which is a trait that they don&#39;t have in common with livestock clowns.

However, even if this is true, they shouldn&#39;t be treated as if they&#39;re much better than livestocks. They&#39;re still in the same family; they aren&#39;t much different outside of this factor, nor are they close to resembling humans in almost [[footnote]] Sapient clowns represent humans in the sense of showing a form of life, as any other creature would. [[/footnote]] any sense.

Sapient clowns aren&#39;t superior to any other species, //especially// not the human race. 

Sapient clowns have the ability to exhibit thoughts, emotions, wants and needs, which is more than other clowns do. I am aware that this means they can revolt against humans, yet humans have the resources needed to shut them down. I mean, if they didn&#39;t, how else would they have been able to capture them as they have?

Even then, there isn&#39;t enough proven sapient clowns to cause a large enough revolt to actually do damage.

**2. Sapient clowns and world domination.**

First, even //looking// at that makes it seem absolutely hysterical. Clowns and world domination in the same sentence? It doesn&#39;t come off right in any sense. If the sentence doesn&#39;t even seem right, how does the entire idea of it make even the smallest amount of sense?

Bingo!

It doesn&#39;t.

Like I said in my previous statements; sapient clowns **do not** have the ability, nor the numbers, to take over humanity.

A vast majority of clowns aren&#39;t sapient, which doesn&#39;t help the sapient clowns&#39; and Levealuto Aston&#39;s situation. Every single sapient clown, and some non-sapient clowns, would have to group up together to at least semi-successfully go through with this idea. It&#39;s just not doable, really, especially with sapient clowns being raised around litters of other clowns.

I mean, if //you// were raised around a bunch of people that weren&#39;t able to even form language outside of a certain noise, wouldn&#39;t you feel like there wasn&#39;t much hope for you as well?

As chucklets, sapient clowns are forced to grow up around other clown-types, which must dwindle their intelligence levels, and might even bring some to becoming/blending in with another type.

In addition, do you //really// believe that telling a clown to &#34;despise every human except you&#34; will truly work? If you want a clown to hate the entire human race, and you train it to, it&#39;ll do exactly that, and won&#39;t make an exception for you. It&#39;s just purely senseless to believe that that&#39;ll work out in your favor.

**3. Conclusion.**

I hope that after reading my statements, anyone that&#39;s reading this has been encouraged against Aston&#39;s ideas, and goes with my more rational stance. Sapient clowns aren&#39;t higher beings, and shouldn&#39;t be treated as such.

As for Levaluto, I hope you come to your senses and realize how irrational this is. I hope so for the safety of yourself and for others, and if you don&#39;t, then I hope that you don&#39;t do something that harms you or someone else.

I appreciate everyone that&#39;s reading this, especially anyone who&#39;ll share this around to other people who you might or might not know.</textarea></pre>
