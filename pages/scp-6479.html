Here&#39;s access to the old document and the recent incident report. Thanks for taking a look at this again, I didn&#39;t want to be bothering you but you know how it works, I need a peer review on all of this before I can finish my revisions. Now the team who recorded this did try their best to keep this watchable and all but the video does get pretty graphic at times, just a heads up.

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the non-hazardous nature of SCP-6479, difficulty in conventionally containing it to any further degree, and the fact that all staff operating within Site-26 became aware of SCP-6479’s existence during its original manifestation, SCP-6479 is permitted to freely roam the low-risk sectors of Site-26. All staff should be made aware of SCP-6479&#39;s anomalous properties, and precautions should be made to ensure it does not enter an area of the Site where its presence could interfere with ongoing operations.

**Description:** SCP-6479 is an animate two-dimensional silhouette, resembling the reverse projection of a large canine (most closely resembling a wolf), which manifested in Site-26 shortly after its construction in 1952. SCP-6479 is not affected by incoming light, despite it resembling a shadow. 

SCP-6479 is sentient, being actively aware of its surroundings and capable of linearly changing the surface it appears on, as well as its shape and size, in accordance with outside stimuli. Upon initial manifestation the behavior of SCP-6479 was typical to that of a wild animal; most commonly being extremely timid/evasive, but quickly becoming &#39;aggressive&#39; if approached. When in contact with personnel, SCP-6479 would change its appearance to become more threatening, adopting a larger size and heavily exaggerated facial features (e.g. jaws, fangs, eyes) likely intended to induce a fear response. Due to these behaviors, all attempts to conduct experiments involving SCP-6479 have failed. However, likely due to an extended amount of time in captivity, SCP-6479&#39;s behavior has since become more docile, and it is now partially accustomed to the presence of humans. SCP-6479 has been proven to recognize specific individuals, even retaining knowledge of their behavior towards itself. It is still worth noting that SCP-6479 is not tame, and will still exhibit evasive and aggressive behaviors when in sustained human contact.

It has been noted that SCP-6479 is most active in the lower maintenance levels of Site-26, particularly around the Generator Room, though the reason for this behavior is not known.

**Addendum:** During the construction of Site-26, a stone monument dated to the 1600s baring intricate carvings of wolves along with an inscription in Irish Gaelic was discovered on-site. Initial attempts at a translation of the inscription yielded little due to the lack of appropriate scholars and the condition of the artifact making the inscription difficult to read. The words &#39;wolf&#39; and &#39;shadow&#39; were all that could be translated. After the discovery of SCP-6479, and the possibility of a connection, there was renewed interest in the artifact, and attempts at a full translation were carried out.

&gt; 
&gt; [[size 107%]]**Incident Log 26-6479:**[[/size]]
&gt; Date: ██/██/87
&gt; 
&gt; Following the removal of all but one anomalous item from Site-26 during decommissioning procedures, Site-26 underwent a scheduled power grid reset (noted to be the first time the grid had been deactivated at the site). Site-26 did not restart its generator, prompting attempts at contacting the site. After 3 hours of no response, emergency response teams arrived at the site to find that a manual lockdown had been initiated. Universal Task Force-22, being the closest available team to deal with such an incident, was called in to investigate. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Incident Investigation Report + Video Log**
&gt; 
&gt; 4 hours after the beginning of the incident, UT-22 arrived and assembled at the southern entrance to Site-26. The team was composed of 6 members:
&gt; 
&gt; **UT-Coyote:** 
&gt; 32, Male, Designated as team leader. Equipped with a secondary live feed device as well as the standard issue loadout.
&gt; 
&gt; **UT-Collie:**
&gt; 26, Male, Designated as a communications operator. Equipped with a primary live feed device and the team&#39;s communications equipment as well as a standard issue loadout.
&gt; 
&gt; **UT-Fox:**
&gt; 23, Female, Designated as fire support. Equipped with a standard issue loadout.
&gt; 
&gt; **UT-Ocelot:** 
&gt; 26, Male, Designated Specialist. Equipped with mission-specific equipment as well as a standard issue loadout.
&gt; 
&gt; **UT-Wolf:** 
&gt; 34, Male, Designated as fire support. Equipped with a standard issue loadout.
&gt; 
&gt; **UT-Fallow:**
&gt; 24, Male, Designated as Fire Support. Equipped with a standard issue loadout.
&gt; 
&gt; ----------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Video and Audio Transcription:**
&gt;
&gt; [After setting up their equipment at the entrance to Site-26, three members of the task force were sent down the elevator shaft via a pulley system. UT-Collie activates his live feed body camera.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;Ugh, why do we always have to go in head first? I fucking swear Kincade never gets a crumb of dirt on his boots.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;Yeah but you never bring that up to him face to face do you?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;Well- I-&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Collie:** &#34;Two more feet!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;Point is that I don&#39;t want to compromise mission effectiveness with an argument.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;Oh right, yeah. &#39;mission effectiveness.&#39; &#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [All three members of the team reach the bottom of the elevator shaft and are standing on the ceiling of the elevator car. Collie and Ocelot begin to pry open the emergency hatch on the top of the car, upon doing so Collie recoils.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Collie:** &#34;Agh, what is that god-awful smell?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;Alright, masks on ladies.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Fox and Ocelot proceed to jump down into the interior of the elevator car while Collie waits for the rest of the team to finish their descent. Upon the rest of the team reaching the car, Ocelot and Fox begin to pry open the elevator doors.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Fallow:** &#34;That fuckin&#39; smell, Jesus.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Collie:** &#34;I know right?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [The rest of the team begins to fit their masks on.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Collie, you know it&#39;s your job to tell us about these things //before// we jump headfirst into them, right?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;Yeah right, &#39;headfirst&#39;. No mention of the royal red carpet.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;You aren&#39;t exactly royal quality, Fox.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Anyway, everyone&#39;s night vision working?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Collie:** &#34;Affirmative.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fallow:** &#34;Yep.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;Yes, sir.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;Could I have opened that door otherwise?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Wolf:** &#34;Mhm.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [The team proceeds, entering the entrance hall, and approaches the front gate.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;It&#39;s completely sealed, notify control I&#39;m gonna have to cut it open.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Collie:** &#34;Copy that.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [The team requests to use a heavy-duty blow torch to cut through the front gate. Control accepts the request and Ocelot begins to cut through the metal.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;Might wanna take a few more steps back, this&#39;ll have a bit more umpf than-&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [The rest of the team begin to cover their eyes while backing away from Ocelot.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;Jesus, no fucking kidding!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Some prior warning would&#39;ve been nice.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fallow:** &#34;Yeah I just got out of Lasik, you want me to go back to lookin&#39; like Harry Potter?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;Hey uh-&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;Yeah, be more considerate next time Oce&#39;.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fallow:** &#34;You&#39;re the one always going on about being polite.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;Guys- I really-&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;C&#39;mon don&#39;t interrupt the man!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fallow:** &#34;You&#39;re so rude, always going on about not talking too much, and now you-&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Wolf thrusts Fallow and Fox aside as he moves toward the door, utilizing a crowbar to leverage the cut-out section of the gate to fall through to the other side.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Wolf has a point, you two chit-chat too much. We have a job to do, and the fact I can smell that shit through this mask tells me it isn&#39;t gonna be pretty.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;Aye aye, cap&#39;n.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [The team begins to vault through the sizable gap now present in the front gate, entering the first entrance checkpoint. Fox enters first and begins to walk toward the security booth after noticing that the door had been completely ripped off, the rest of the team stand close to the front gate and turn to Coyote.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Alright, control says this is where the manual lockdown was initiated, look around to&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;Hey uh- hey uhm-&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Zip it, Fox, that&#39;s an order. Now, Wolf-Fallow, you two move ahead and secure the- &#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;Oh just get in here...please.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Why would you-&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Coyote, Collie, and Ocelot make their way into the security booth, now noticing the state of the door. Once they enter, Fox is leaning on the wall purposefully viewing away from the desk; clinging to the manual lockdown lever is a crudely severed hand. Collie goes to point the camera to something on the floor but is stopped by Coyote who redirects it upwards.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Collie:** Control, this is UT-Collie, we have a confirmed casualty, please advise.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Control contacts the team, advising them to follow protocol Amber U-R-S.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Collie:** &#34;Copy that. Amber U-R-S.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;I think I stepped in... fuck - I&#39;m sorry - I just... wasn&#39;t ready to-&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Wolf, get her out of here.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Wolf enters the room and gently grabs Fox by the arm, escorting her out of the room.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Is everybody else able to handle some blood?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Collie and Ocelot both turn to Coyote and nod.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;&#39;Right then, good. Wolf - once Fox is calmed down, take her and Fallow to search through to the next wing. Ocelot, can you access the system here?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Ocelot approaches the desk and begins to inspect the equipment.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Collie, ask command if they have any fuckin’ idea what did this.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Collie contacts Control, Control responds informing the team that they are not aware of anything capable of inflicting the observed damage still within the Site; advising further caution.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Noted. Oce’ - any luck with accessing the system?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;Normally I&#39;d be able to from here but the power&#39;s completely drained, looks like the manual lockdown took the last of the reserve.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Collie, ask command if we can get power back on any time soon.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Collie:** &#34;Control, requesting the status of power to the facility.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Control responds, informing the team that the site isn&#39;t connected to any sufficient infrastructure to supply exterior power and that they&#39;ll have to restart the site&#39;s generator manually.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Wolf, Fallow, you two get that?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fallow:** &#34;Reading you loud and clear.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;How&#39;s the hall lookin&#39;?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fallow:** &#34;It&#39;s clear, but the next room isn&#39;t. Door&#39;s wide open, can see right down into it.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Nothing bitey?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fallow:** &#34;Not unless we&#39;re suddenly in a Romero flick.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Copy that, we&#39;ll pack up here.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Coyote, Ocelot, and Collie make their way into the hallway where Fallow and Wolf are standing guard. Fox is leaning on the wall of the hallway. Coyote signals for the group to head further into the facility.]
&gt; 
&gt; [Wolf approaches Fox and puts his hand on her shoulder.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Wolf:** &#34;You think you can manage?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;Yeah, It&#39;s all good. I just wasn&#39;t expecting something... like that.. Y&#39;know? This was supposed to be a get the kitten from the tree type&#39;a deal. I honestly thought that smell was just a gas leak or something. Spooked me is all.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Wolf:** &#34;It&#39;s understandable. Just watch my six until you feel better.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;Mhm.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [The team enters the next room, the door has been bashed down from its hinges and is laying on the floor in the previous hallway. Two bodies possessing lacerations to their back are laying face-first on the floor in the middle of the room.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Collie:** &#34;I&#39;d reckon from the way they&#39;re laying there that they were trying to get into the security office, try and lock the door behind &#39;em.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Seems like whatever did this had the same idea.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; [Ocelot and Fallow enter the next room ahead of the rest of the team. Suddenly Fallow stops.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Fallow:** &#34;We got two doors here.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;If you&#39;d bothered to look at the map, that&#39;s a supply closet.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Fallow turns to the door and looks over his shoulder toward Ocelot as he opens it.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Fallow:** &#34;Never know, might find something important, mister map ma- JESUS FUCK.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Fallow backs up, aiming his gun toward the supply closet. Coyote, Wolf, and Collie storm toward the closet while Ocelot and Fox watch their backs.]
&gt; 
&gt; [The team crowd a pair of disembodied legs that are hanging suspended via a dislocated spinal cord pinned to the inside of a wall vent. Turning around, a vent on the wall behind them had been pushed open, the heavy-grade vent cover on the floor was laying on top of a pile of broken bones and tissue, and the remnants of a human face underneath can be seen pushing out from the grating.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;From the uh- from the looks of it they were trying to use the vents to get around.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;And something didn&#39;t wanna wait it&#39;s turn.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;You think there was a sign saying one person at a time? those things save lives at Waterparks.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Feeling better I take it? You wanna come over here or you gonna make your quips from across the hall? Yeah, that&#39;s what I thought.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Oce&#39; where&#39;s that vent lead?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;I&#39;d assume they were trying to get to the Cafeteria-Lobby, it&#39;s designated as this site&#39;s emergency assembly area. Right next to the Main Security Offices too.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Right, a plan: we go turn the power on then make our way to the Lobby, if anyone&#39;s still alive we take them into the Main Security Office and do what we can from there. Should give us decent protection and a vantage point to know what we&#39;re lookin&#39; at before the literal clean-up crews arrive.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;We clear on that?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Collie:** &#34;Affirmative.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;Affirmative, sir.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fallow:** &#34;Copy that.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;Sounds good.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Wolf nods.]
&gt; 
&gt; [The Team move through the nearby door.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Fox - Wolf, check the corridor behind us. Have Oce&#39; lock it down if you don&#39;t spot anything.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Fox and Wolf move down the corridor behind the rest of the team, opening a door at its terminus. They inspect the room on the other side. Fox pauses and readies her firearm, she turns to wolf as if expecting something before speaking.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;Got a trail of blood, all the doors are closed.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Wolf, follow the trail, check if someone&#39;s still breathing on the other end.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Wolf nods and begins making his way into the room following the blood trail into a small sub-section of the room split off by a glass wall. He goes out of view of the camera. Soon after, Wolf walks back into view and past Fox, standing in the doorway.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Wolf:** &#34;Dead.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;Care to elaborate?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Wolf:** &#34;Bloodloss.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Fox looks at Wolf and tilts her head slightly.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;From what?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Wolf pauses for a second.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Wolf:** &#34;Hmgh... Bite.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Wolf walks back toward the rest of the team, Fox turns to cover Ocelot who begins to seal the door behind them.]
&gt; 
&gt; [Wolf whispers into Coyote&#39;s ear, coyote promptly grips his gun tightly.]
&gt; 
&gt; [After Fox and Ocelot finish, Coyote directs the team to move toward the Generator Room, they begin moving toward their destination with Fox and Wolf covering the team&#39;s six.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Ocelot, how long till we get to the Generator?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Ocelot looks down at a map he&#39;s holding in his hand, trailing his finger along the print.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;There&#39;s a set of stairs going down there, just a few minutes walk... but we&#39;ll have to get through another security checkpoint...&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Ocelot suddenly stops, reaching his arm out toward Coyote.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;What&#39;s the holdup?&#34; [The rest of the team stops.]
&gt; 
&gt; [Ocelot points to an area on the map directly ahead of them.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;I didn&#39;t think such an old building would have this but... Checkpoint&#39;s got automatic turrets. 5.56×45mm.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Won&#39;t matter will it? power&#39;s cut.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;Says here they&#39;re not on the main generator supply, they have their own battery in case of... well... this.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fallow:** &#34;Well, shit.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Coyote turns to Collie, standing directly in front of the camera]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Collie, contact command and ask if there&#39;s a way to disable those turrets.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Collie nods and contacts control]
&gt; 
&gt; **Collie:** &#34;Control, is there any way to disable the-&#34; [Collie grabs the map from Ocelot] &#34;-the two 5.56×45mm turrets at Security Checkpoint 2A-22?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Control responds, informing the team to head to the area and inspect the security checkpoint while they figure out a way to disable the turrets.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Collie:** &#34;Control says they&#39;re workin&#39; on it, says we should head there in the meantime.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;We can hear &#39;em too, buddy.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Collie:** &#34;Oh- yeah. heh.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Coyote signals for the group to move out toward the Security Checkpoint, they arrive and pause in front of the door leading to the room.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Collie:** &#34;Control, you got anythin&#39;?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Control responds, informing the team to inspect the checkpoint.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Fallow:** &#34;Are they nuts?! you said there were turret-&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Coyote hushes Fallow and puts his hand on the manual door control. Signaling for the team to rush backward. The team runs to the other end of the hall and Coyote opens the door, taking cover at the adjacent corner.]
&gt; 
&gt; [The team pauses in anticipation while taking cover. The turrets are out of view of the camera due to Collie&#39;s hunched position.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Well, what&#39;d you see?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;Jesus Christ...&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Wolf stands up and begins walking toward Coyote.]
&gt; 
&gt; [Wolf grabs Coyote and positions him to view the room, Collie walks up behind them.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Wolf:** &#34;Not good.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fallow:** &#34;What&#39;d you mean, this is great news.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [The room comes into view of the camera, both automatic turrets are ripped out from the ceiling and smashed on the floor, with the wiring for the turrets hanging from the gaps in the ceiling above them.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Wolf:** &#34;It means that these-&#34; [Wolf nods to his gun, bashing it lightly against Fallow&#39;s own weapon.] &#34;-These just became useless.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Coyote walks into the room, kneeling down.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Well...&#34; [Coyote trails his finger along the floor, coating it in a red substance.] &#34;At least we know it bleeds.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Wolf:** &#34;Ant bites you, you bleed, yes?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Salient point.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [The team enters the room and closes the door behind them. Coyote and Wolf turn to the security booth.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;So, how are we getting through?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Wolf points to the smashed glass window of the security booth.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;Conveniant.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Wolf walks up to the booth slowly and aims around the corner into the booth&#39;s interior.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Wolf:** &#34;Clear.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [The rest of the team vault into the booth, Wolf holds a finger to his mouth and nods toward Fox as they do so.]
&gt; 
&gt; [As Fox lifts her leg over the wall, Wolf tilts her head toward the ceiling and helps her across. The sound of squelching is audible.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;God... it feels like I&#39;m walking through oatmeal.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Wolf:** &#34;You do that often then?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Fox snickers, as they then exit the booth to the other side of the checkpoint.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Collie:** &#34;Stairs are just ahead.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [The team begins to walk down several flights of stairs, Coyote and Fallow at the helm of the group checking each turn before continuing downwards. A majority of the steps have large pieces of material broken off at their edges.]
&gt; 
&gt; [They exit on the bottom floor, exiting into a maintenance tunnel.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;Good thing we have these.&#34; [Ocelot taps his night vision equipment.] &#34;It&#39;s just down here.&#34; [He points down the tunnel.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Fallow:** &#34;It wouldn&#39;t be any darker here though, tiger.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Ocelot turns to him and shakes his head.]
&gt; 
&gt; [The team continues walking, as they reach the corner Wolf and Coyote take the lead and check it.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Clear, move in.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [The team enters the generator room, the equipment is severely damaged with large gashes on most surfaces, and multiple consoles are completely torn apart. Embers of a fire glow amongst the debris, the floor covered in soot.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;What in the fuck.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;I&#39;m assuming we can&#39;t use this? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;This place is totaled.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Well at least have a look around and try to see if anything&#39;s still working.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Ocelot nods and begins searching the room.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Fallow:** &#34;Coyote, we&#39;ve got a body over here.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Coyote and Collie walk around a corner, viewing a body sitting at the edge of a buildup of soot and debris.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Doesn&#39;t look injured.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Collie:** &#34;Definitely didn&#39;t burn to death. Hey-did you check his pulse?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fallow:** &#34;Yep, he&#39;s dead.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Smoke from the fire must&#39;ve done it. Not sure why he isn&#39;t torn to ribbons like the others though - the thing or whatever was definitely in here with him.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Fox walks up behind the group.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;Maybe it was spooked by the fire?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;May-be...&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Coyote raises his voice to call out to Ocelot across the room.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Hey- Oce! You find anything?!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Ocelot comes stumbling over, carrying a heavy piece of equipment in his hands, he motions for the team to return to where he came from. The team follows.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;What on earth is that?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;Mobile power source - think of it like a big ass battery.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Ocelot bends down and plugs the equipment into the wall.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;Great news! &#39;switchboard&#39;s still intact.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Ocelot flips a switch on the equipment and stands up.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;What&#39;s it good for?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;We&#39;d be able to some power to a few systems, also good for killing my back.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Coyote nods and ponders for a moment.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Send it to the Main Security Office and the Lobby, we&#39;ll go up there and use the cameras to see if anyone&#39;s still alive.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Ocelot pulls down several large switches on the wall and an audible humming is emitted around them.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;Sounds like it worked.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;Fine and dandy!&#34; 
&gt; 
&gt;**Coyote:** &#34;Considering... well... this...&#34; [Coyote gestures to the damaged equipment.] &#34;-And what we found earlier... I&#39;m saying we get to the Security Office as quickly as possible.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Ocelot takes the map off of Collie and hunches over it.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;Considering it&#39;s directly above us...&#39; quickest route would be through the elevator.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Alright, lead us there.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [The team exits the Generator Room and moves down the maintenance tunnels.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Collie:** &#34;Wait - how are we gonna use the elevator?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;Remember how we came in?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fallow:** &#34;Thought we left our stuff for this shit at the entrance.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;This one...&#34; [Coyote walks into the elevator and opens the hatch on the ceiling, leaning into the elevator shaft.] &#34;...has a ladder.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;How&#39;d you know that?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Think you&#39;re the only one who can glance at a map?&#34; 
&gt; 
&gt; [Coyote pulls himself into the elevator shaft and extends a hand to Ocelot who promptly takes it. Wolf follows, beginning to climb up the ladder. Fallow pauses and extends a hand down to Fox.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Fallow:** &#34;M&#39;lady.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;Eugh, Kincade can you come back down and give me a hand?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fallow:** &#34;I am insulted.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;You wish, hurry it up down there!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Fallow begins climbing up the ladder.]
&gt; 
&gt; [Fox jumps, grasping onto the ledge, but fails to pull herself up all the way.]
&gt; 
&gt; [Collie approaches her and gives her a boost, allowing her to pull herself up onto the roof of the elevator car.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Fallow:** &#34;Oh okay, you&#39;ll let him help you but not me?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;I did just say I&#39;d prefer //Kincade// to you.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** [Calling from the top of the shaft.] &#34;No luck with the ladies, no luck with GETTING THE HELL UP HERE!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Fallow begins climbing at a faster rate as Fox and Collie begin their ascent.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Fallow:** &#34;I&#39;m sure she&#39;d rather have Wolf carry her around anyway.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;Shut up!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Finally, a decent fucking opinion.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [The rest of the team reaches the top of the shaft.]
&gt; 
&gt; [Wolf pulls Coyote away from the others and leans in, talking to him. Coyote turns to the rest of the team and then back to Wolf. He nods before turning back again.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Alright, we ready to move? Good. Fox and Wolf, you&#39;re on our 12. Fallow, watch our backs. I want us in there within the next minute, not a single holdup.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [The team begins moving toward the Main Security Office with Fox and Wolf at the front of the group, closely followed by Coyote and Collie.]
&gt; 
&gt; [Wolf approaches Fox, touching her shoulder.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Wolf:** &#34;Don&#39;t let him push your buttons.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** [Leaning in toward Wolf.] &#34;Kincade didn&#39;t tell you to tell me that did he?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Wolf:** &#34;No, he just wanted to put you back on a security detail. Get a new gunner.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** [Whispering] &#34;What?! that&#39;s bullshit - you know-&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Wolf:** &#34;He has a point. You are very mouthy, immature at times. He understood that the incident in Blair Atholl, not your fault... but after that embarrassment in Nevada? you were on thin rope with him. You know he grew up there, it was his dream post.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;So what? why haven&#39;t you thrown me out again if I&#39;m just some fuckup.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Wolf:** &#34;No. You&#39;re not. I convinced him to let you stay.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Fox looks up to Wolf, slowing her pace to a walk.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;Why?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Wolf:** &#34;Because I don&#39;t trust anyone to watch my back as much as you. //You remind-//... You&#39;re our best shot, kid.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Wolf pushes her forward]
&gt; 
&gt; **Wolf:** &#34;Now, pick up the pace and stop the quips.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Coyote picks up his pace and moves closer to Wolf.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;She understands?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Wolf:** &#34;Yeah, I think so.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Coyote stops, allowing Ocelot and Collie to catch up to him.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Fallow:** [Raising his voice from some distance behind the team] &#34;What&#39;re you lot yapping about?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Talking to Command- you want bedding in a local place or a hotel after we&#39;re debriefed?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fallow:** &#34;Local places here are usually pretty alright.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Coyote gives a thumbs up.]
&gt; 
&gt; [Continuing through the facility, the group passes the several doorways and rooms littered with broken furniture. Attempts are made by the group to investigate each room, but no survivors are found. Further attempts to call out to any potential survivors yield no results.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Collie:** &#34;Looks like most of these barricades didn’t hold up too well.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Nothing but bodies, I don’t think there’s any point in searching each one anymore, keep the pace up.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [The team arrives at a junction, on their right is the Cafeteria and Lobby area, and to their left is the entrance to the Main Security Office. Light is emanating from both. Wolf walks cautiously to the right.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Wolf:** &#34;Barricaded just like those last few doors we passed. This one actually held up it seems. No way into it... though the lights are definitely on.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;Good to know I didn&#39;t waste my back on nothing.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Coyote approaches the barricaded entrance to the Cafeteria-Lobby area.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;This is Universal Task Force-22, if anybody is inside, respond immediately.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [There is no response.]
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Alright, everyone into the Security Office.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [As the team makes their way into the Main Security Office, they switch off their Night Vision equipment. Passing through a front desk area, they come to a flight of stairs, the door is collapsed inwards. Bullet holes cover the walls at the bottom of the stairs. Upon seeing this, Coyote holds his arm out, and the group pause.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;This is Universal Task Force-22, If anyone is up there, respond now.&#34;
&gt;
&gt; [There is no response.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;One final warning: me and my team are coming up.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [The team begins to move up the stairs, turning the corner there the room is devoid of any sign of a struggle. The door to another staircase leading down into the cafeteria is closed.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Oce&#39;, check the cameras - Fallow, see if you can get that door open.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Wolf:** &#34;I wouldn’t do that if I were you.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Wolf is over by the window, looking down into the Lobby.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;See something?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Wolf:** &#34;Remember that vent?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Coyote walks over to the window, beside Wolf.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Fallow- hold- hold off on the door. Wouldya?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fallow:** &#34;It&#39;s sealed anyway. Deadlocked.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Good.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Coyote turns, visibly shaken, he reaches for his flask and takes a drink of water.]
&gt; 
&gt; [Wolf walks over to the cameras beside Ocelot.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Fox:** &#34;They were all in there, huh?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Wolf waits for the cameras to boot up before manually turning the feed of the Lobby off.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;Hey! Kincade!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Gimmie&#39; a minute here-&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;No-seriously! look!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Ocelot directs the group&#39;s attention to one of the cameras, all of the cameras are in complete darkness but one of them shows a small amount of light emanating from one camera&#39;s view.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;That&#39;s a person- it has to be. Right?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;I-uh-I guess yeah- it could be I suppose.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Wolf walks up to Coyote and strongly pats him on the back twice.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Wolf:** &#34;We&#39;d had better go check that out then, pronto.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Coyote wipes his face with his hand and stands up straight, turning around to face the team.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Ocelot, where is that light coming from?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;A break-room not too far from here!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Coyote walks over to Collie and utilizes the communications equipment.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Command, please advise.&#34; 
&gt; 
&gt; [Control advises the team to announce their presence via intercom. Control state that Red U-R-S is now in effect, and that reinforcements are en-route but personnel safety should be prioritized above that of the Task Force. The team is instructed to proceed with caution. Coyote motions for Collie to utilize the intercom system within the security checkpoint, Collie complies.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Collie:** &#34;This is Universal Task Force-22, we have entered the facility. If you can hear this announcement, do not attempt to locate us, we will come to you. Stay put.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Right then, let&#39;s move it! Wolf and Fox you&#39;re on our backs - Fallow you&#39;re on me! - Oce&#39; - you keep us in the right direction!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [The team nod, re-equipping their night vision gear and promptly moving out of the security office, making their way through the halls toward the source of the light. Finally coming to a junction with 4 exits.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;It&#39;s just on the other side of that door, down the hall from there.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Coyote nods and positions himself and Fallow at the door, guns ready.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Cover us, we&#39;re going in. Collie, make sure command is seein&#39; this.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Collie follows close behind Coyote and Fallow as they open the door, revealing the source of light to be coming from the interior of a barricaded breakroom at the end of the hall. A figure identified as ████████ is standing in the room illuminated by a small battery-fed lamp. Behind ████████ is the silhouette of SCP-6479 on the wall. The lamp flickers and ████████ panics, rushing toward the window, he begins to bang his fist against it frantically.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;Stay where you are! we&#39;re here to help!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [The lamp goes off and a scream can be heard emanating from the room followed by shattering glass. Movement can be discerned, though the source is not clear from the footage. Coyote primes his gun and shouts loudly.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Coyote:** &#34;OPEN FIRE! NOW!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Fallow, Coyote and Fox immediately begin to fire their weapons down the hall, soon followed by Collie and Ocelot firing their handguns. The footage as a result becomes less coherent.]
&gt; 
&gt; [A large quadrupedal entity resembling an extraordinarily large wolf, from now on referred to as SCP-6479-2, closes the distance between itself and the team in seconds, lunging into Fallow and pinning him to the ground. Another stream of gunfire opens up into SCP-6479-2 as it stalls, the source of the gunfire presumed to be from Wolf.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Ocelot:** &#34;FUCK-FUCK WHAT IS THA-&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Fallow lets out a wheeze, his ribcage crushed inward by SCP-6479-2&#39;s front legs. His body is then tossed down the hall, directly hitting Ocelot and knocking him to the ground.]
&gt; 
&gt; [Coyote and Collie begin moving backward, still firing their weapons into it.]
&gt; 
&gt; [SCP-6479-2 then rams into Collie and Coyote, knocking them both down. Collie stops moving and is presumed unconscious.]
&gt; 
&gt; [From the new angle of the feed, Fox and Wolf can be seen stepping back while continuing to unload into SCP-6479-2, Wolf soon covering for Fox as she reloads her firearm.] 
&gt; 
&gt; [SCP-6479-2 thrashes its head toward Ocelot - biting down on his skull - it pulls back, decapitating him. Coyote regains his posture and fires his sidearm into the back of its head. Several yelps are audible.]
&gt; 
&gt; [Coyote is kicked down by SCP-6479-2&#39;s hind leg, falling onto his back.]
&gt; 
&gt; [Turning its attention back to Fox and Wolf, SCP-6479-2 makes a swift swiping motion toward Fox with its foreleg, Wolf intervenes and leaps in front of Fox, grasping her by the waist and pulling them both down toward the ground. SCP-6479-2&#39;s claws lacerate Wolf&#39;s back as its foreleg slams into the wall beside them, causing a large indentation in the concrete. Wolf then moves back while still grasping Fox, pulling them both away from view.]
&gt; 
&gt; [Coyote looks toward Ocelot&#39;s corpse before kicking one of SCP-6479-2&#39;s hindlegs, drawing its attention, and allowing him to skirt around toward Ocelot&#39;s body. Grabbing a flashlight from Ocelot&#39;s utility belt, Coyote shines it toward SCP-6479-2 causing it to demanifest.]
&gt; 
&gt; [Coyote looks side to side and then up toward the ceiling, trailing a shadow (presumed to be SCP-6479) moving on the wall before a set of jaws descend from above him, biting into his shoulder. The flashlight falls from his hand. Coyote draws a knife and impales the side of its face, its jaws unclenching.]
&gt; 
&gt; [Coyote collapses to the ground but manages to narrowly evade another attack. He begins crawling backward, grasping toward the flashlight. SCP-6479-2 presses its paw on top of Coyote&#39;s torso, stopping him from reaching the flashlight.]
&gt; 
&gt; [Wolf then appears from the doorframe and fires point blank into SCP-6479-2, in an attempt to save Coyote. SCP-6479-2 thrashes widely toward Wolf, knocking his gun from his arms and slicing clean through his stomach area, partially exposing the side of his intestines, which begin to slump outward from the wound. SCP-6479-2 then lunges toward Wolf and bites the side of his torso, impaling him with its teeth.]
&gt; 
&gt; [Several shots ring out from behind wolf, two bullets hitting SCP-6479-2 in the eye, causing it to fumble and loosen its grip on Coyote.]
&gt; 
&gt; [Coyote quickly thrusts himself toward the flashlight, promptly grasping it and shining it in the direction of SCP-6479.]
&gt; 
&gt; [SCP-6479-2 again demanifests as light from the flashlight fills the hall. Fox can be seen grabbing Wolf and pulling him from view. Coyote hastily crawls backward out of the hall, continuing to shine the flashlight. The door is promptly closed.]
&gt; 
&gt; Shortly after this, the secondary live feed device was activated, ending the feed from Collie&#39;s perspective. A thick smear of blood over the lens of the secondary live feed device and the pace of movement makes the footage recorded from it redundant.
