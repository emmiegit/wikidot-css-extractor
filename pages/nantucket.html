//There once was a man named Hopper
Whose ability made him quite a showstopper.
With a nauseous, dizzy feeling
He&#39;d shift and end up reeling
At a new world that was quite the whopper.//

//The people there communicate in limericks.
It wasn&#39;t something they did just for kicks.
No matter how painful the rhyme
They did it all the time
And if you didn&#39;t, well, there was a fix.//

//The world had a memetic effect.
It was quite a pain in Hopper&#39;s neck.
It made him rhyme, too
Even though it, he didn&#39;t want to do.
But him, it did affect.//

//It was difficult to get any info
When you have to give your words a certain flow.
There&#39;s a lot of rhymes for Yggdrasil
But few that fit the bill
When trying to find why the world was so.//

//It was the work of the Jailors
affecting the whole world down to the mailers.
Something broke containment
And told the Masquerade to get bent.
Now everyone was rhyming wailers.//

//The Foundation crumbled, of course
When facing the power of the world&#39;s force.
From the US to Lichtenstein
No one thought their work was fine.
And yet they were never able to find the source.//

//Soon, life simply adjusted,
People adapting to that which in they were thrusted.
Movies were now quite long;
Don&#39;t even get him started on the songs.
But this was something that everyone just trusted.//

//Hopper wouldn&#39;t shift for six weeks
Resigning to not being able to properly speak.
Turns out it also affects the way he writes
And he thought to himself, &#34;This bites!&#34;
It&#39;ll be a pain to transcribe what he seeks.//

//The Merchants were still around.
An unpleasant fact that he found.
Though their language was more poetic
Their &#34;ethics&#34; made people sick
But they still traded power by the pound.//

//The Merrymakers adapted to this strife
And their commentary still struck like a knife.
They were grateful for the meme
But for Bones, it would seem
they could not do meter to save their life.//

//The Hand was flourishing and thriving
Welcoming him to the Library after arriving.
There were many more people reading books
And exploring all of the nooks.
And Hopper found what for he was striving.//

//It was one of the ##green|folks without name##
Who turned speaking into such a game.
One last act of spite
On the Jailors who started their plight.
&#34;Damn,&#34; Hopper thought, &#34;Such a shame.&#34;//

//Eventually, mercifully, Hopper shifted back.
But there was one hell of a setback.
The limerick effect had stayed
And so he called for aid.
But a cure, the Hand currently lacked.//

//So now Hopper lays down in his loft
Forever grateful for a bed that was soft.
But this waiting he can&#39;t stand;
The Healers need to hurry and//
HELP ME TURN THIS DAMN THING OFF!
