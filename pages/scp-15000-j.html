**Addendum.Interview Logs:**    

&gt;  **Interviewer:** Doctor Georgia Penelope
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewee:** SCP-15000-J
&gt; 
&gt;  **Foreword:** Interview #1.
&gt; 
&gt; **[BEGIN LOG]** 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Penelope:** Good morning SCP-15000-J, today I would like to ask you a few questions, I hope that&#39;s okay with you. 
&gt; 
&gt;  **SCP-15000-J:** //[Chuckling]// Of course, but before we begin, how was your Butterfingers with your McNuggets last night?
&gt; 
&gt;  **Dr. Penelope:** How... How do you know about that? 
&gt; 
&gt;  **SCP-15000-J:** It was simple, you have five stains on your coat, but I didn&#39;t smell anything in your breath indicating you ate breakfast.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Penelope:** Now that is some bullshi—
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-15000-J:** Tch tch tch, so quick to anger, but now, I know everything about your personality! You&#39;re the type to hate your position in society!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Penelope:** That&#39;s a mere generalization. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-15000-J:** But is it? This morning you... You were forced to get your inconsiderate boss some coffee after you bumped your head on a door. You were probably thinking &#34;Why do I have to get this moron some coffee, I should be in charge.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Penelope:** That&#39;s... That is not true.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-15000-J:** But it is, this morning while you fixed him coffee you spit in it! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Head Research Campe:** She did what? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-15000-J:**  But that wasn&#39;t your first time, you did this several times, you even did [DATA EXPUNGED]. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Penelope:** He&#39;s lying, don&#39;t believe a word he says!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-15000-J:** Look on your cameras then, Doctor Campe!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Penelope:** Wha—Wha—Wha—
&gt; 
&gt;  **Head Research Campe:** //Doctor Penelope//, come in my office right now.
&gt; 
&gt; **[END LOG]** 



&gt; **Interviewer:** Doctor Fabrizio  Samuel 
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewee:** SCP-15000-J
&gt; 
&gt;  **Foreword:** Interview #2.
&gt; 
&gt;  **[BEGIN LOG]**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Samuel:** Hello SCP-15000-J, I would like to ask why did you um... expose D— Junior Researcher Penelope. 
&gt; 
&gt;  **SCP-15000-J:** Expose, is that what you call it? I didn&#39;t expose anyone, that was just simple mental exercise. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Samuel:** A exercise for what? 
&gt; 
&gt;  **SCP-15000-J:** //[Looking up]//... Until the time I reach the pinnacle of the one above all. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Samuel:** Could you please elaborate?  
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-15000-J:** Elaborate, why should I? What are you tr... Hehe, I see now. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Samuel:** You see what?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-15000-J:** You&#39;re not a doctor, you&#39;re a spy!
&gt; 
&gt;  **Dr. Samuel:** //[Stands up]// This is getting ridiculous, can we en—
&gt; 
&gt;  **SCP-15000-J:** Why are you leaving so early, Chaos Insurgency?
&gt; 
&gt;  **Spy:** How do you know about that? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-15000-J:** It was simple, this organization must have enemies, I watch too much tv not to know that and while you were in here you didn&#39;t write down notes immediately, you waited five seconds do it! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Spy:** But how did you come up with a name?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-15000-J:**  SCP Foundation has 13 letters and this is my second interview, so 2 plus 13 equals 15 and what has 15 letters, Chaos Insurgency.
&gt; 
&gt; You see, I trained my mind for five years on a specific mountain in a specific region to increase my mental power. On that mountain, I had learned the art of seeing with your eyes. With this power, I could deduce anything about you by just the way you walk. But of course, not anyone can use this power, only the wisest and greatest of minds could dre—
&gt; 
&gt; **Spy:** ... No, no that just makes no sense, our names could have been The Red Nudists. You guys see this right? This is some cra—//[Is rendered unconscious by security guards.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Head Researcher Campe:** If you keep this up, we might have to give you a job. 
&gt; 
&gt;  **SCP-15000-J:** No need, a person would not lie if the truth did not feel dangerous. 
&gt;

&gt; **Interviewer:** Doctor Abbot Daniel. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewee:** SCP-15000-J
&gt; 
&gt;  **Foreword:** Interview #6.  Doctor Abbot Daniel submitted forty-five complaints against SCP-15000-J stating that is exposing  &#39;secrets&#39; of personnel that it interacts with, subsequently decreasing site morale, and it was not anomalous. They were granted an interview with SCP-15000-J to prove this statement. 
&gt; 
&gt;  **[BEGIN LOG]** 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Daniel:**  Good morning SCP-15000-J, how are you feeling? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-15000-J:** Quite we—
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Daniel:** //[Slams several photos of SCP-15000-J working in walmart]// Explain this.
&gt; 
&gt;  **SCP-15000-J:** Clearly, that is me working in WalMart. 
&gt; 
&gt;  **Dr. Daniel:** Yeah, but you said 10 years ago you went to the &#39;mountain&#39; to train. But, the time doesn&#39;t match up; here you are, 10 years ago, working in WalMart. 
&gt; 
&gt;  **SCP-15000-J:** Your point?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Daniel:** You&#39;re not anomalous, you&#39;re just a toothpick con man! You didn&#39;t train with wizards, monks, or hillbillies, you&#39;re just good at... doing things; and so, you don&#39;t belong here and you need to be amnestized immediately!  
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-15000-J:** //[Laughing under its breath]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Daniel:** //[Sweating]// What&#39;s so funny?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-15000-J:** You see, //Doctor Abbot Daniel//, I was the one who made those //fake// pictures!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Daniel:** That&#39;s impossible, these were discovered under high tec—
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-15000-J:** Hush child, I deduced that this will happen 10 years ago when I was training on that mountain. I knew my abilities would be so great that there would be haters coming after me. So I made fake pictures that prove to my haters that I was wrong and they were right, but in reality, they would be proving that I was right and they were wrong. 
&gt; 
&gt; To answer your question that was the reason for my laughter. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Daniel:** //[Laughing under his breath]// 
&gt; 
&gt;  **SCP-15000-J:** Hm, what&#39;s so funny?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Daniel:** You see SCP-15000-J, I made those photos today!
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-15000-J  gasps and stumbles back.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-15000-J:** That just can&#39;t be, I... I deduced it. 
&gt; 
&gt;  **Dr. Daniel:** You deduced nothing but your own downfall!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-15000-J:** Hehe,  but you see I went into the //mountain dew section//, so a mountain nonetheless.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Daniel:** ... No! We are all tired of your //deduction//, you just want to fuck with people, and we are through with you.
&gt; 
&gt;  //Two Junior Researchers embarrassed by SCP-15000-J walks in the room and hold down SCP-15000-J.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-15000-J:** Get your hands off me! //[Dr. Daniel takes out a needle and injects it within SCP-15000-J.]//
&gt; 
&gt;  **SCP-15000-J:** I see, hehe. So this is the end of my legacy... For now that i— //[Is rendered unconscious with a punch from Dr. Daniel.]//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **[END LOG]**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** SCP-15000-J is now put under constant sedation to study its true anomalous ability and increase site morale.
