**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6668-1 and SCP-6668-2 are currently located in the Site-███ cafeteria. Excursion into the former is forbidden.

**Description:** SCP-6668-1 is a large sinkhole located in the floor of Site-███&#39;s cafeteria. SCP-6668-2 is D-1812019, who was lowered into SCP-6668-1 and subsequently developed anomalous properties, which have greatly progressed since this file&#39;s last update at 09:44. A video log of these properties is attached below:

[[div class=&#34;interview&#34;]]
 //[A team of researchers, overseen by Site Director Hughes, are positioned around D-1812019. The latter levitates above the ground, arms thrown behind his back, head angled awkwardly upwards.]//

//[Suddenly D-1812019&#39;s eyes, which had rolled upwards, snap back and glance rapidly around him. He makes eye contact with Researcher Comtois. D-1812019&#39;s Adam&#39;s Apple begins to move.]//

**Comtois:** Director, he&#39;s awake! 

//[As his throat continues to gyrate, D-1812019&#39;s lips begin to quiver.]//

**Comtois:** He&#39;s trying to speak!

//[Site Director Hughes runs over to D-1812019, dragging a chair behind him. He stands on it, positioning himself at the same height as the D-class. He leans towards his mouth, trying to listen.]//

**Hughes:** Come on; what are you trying to tell us?

//[As D-1812019&#39;s lips slowly open, a small paw is pushed through. This is followed by a large, wet rodent, resembling the genus **Rattus**, crawling out of the D-class&#39;s mouth. Once the bulk of its body has emerged, the rat falls to the ground, its tail trailing down D-1812019&#39;s lower lip and chin. It hits the ground with a thud, and quickly scurries away.]//

**Hughes:** What on earth....

//[Before the researchers can react, a wet slurping noise can be heard from D-1812019&#39;s direction. A second, larger rodent is attempting to crawl out his mouth. Unnoticed by the researchers, small red dots begin to appear on his D-class uniform.]//

**Hughes:** Get maintenance in here! Someone try and catch that rat!

//[D-1812019&#39;s right cheek begins to bulge outwards. The second rodent&#39;s exit has been impinged by a third rodent appearing to have crawled up the oesophagus. As the two fight to get out, D-1812019&#39;s left eye suddenly collapses in on itself into a white, damp pulp. From within the socket, a rodent&#39;s front paws emerge, scratching at its surroundings. The right eye darts rapidly between the researchers surrounding him.]//

//[The red dots on D-1812019&#39;s uniform have grown. One of the rodents located within his mouth has clawed entirely through his cheek. It pulls itself through and falls to the floor, as the other rodent situated within the oral cavity exits through the mouth.  The damage to D-1812019&#39;s face has resulted in greater visibility; as the rodents leave the oral cavity, another can be seen crawling up from the back of his throat.]//

**Hughes:** Agh!

//[Without warning, a large laceration forms on D-1812019&#39;s right wrist, spraying Site Director Hughes in blood. He falls off the chair and lands squarely on the floor. A rodent begins to claw its way out of the laceration, covered in blood. As soon as it emerges, it is followed by another. Rodent discharge has continued from D-1812019&#39;s throat, with them now numbering approximately 50. The zygomatic and frontal bones surrounding his left eye have begun to crumble, allowing space for rodents to begin to emerge from the cavity.]//

//[Movement begins within D-1812019&#39;s uniform. The flow of rodents from his right wrist has intensified to the point of severing his hand straight off. As the hand hits the floor, rodents begin to flow from the wound, as other rodents begin to crawl out of both his ear orifices.]//

**Hughes:** Help! Someone help me up!

//[The number of rodents in the vicinity is within high triple figures. Whilst some run to the corners of the room or into the ventilation shafts, others begin to swarm Hughes, preventing him from standing. Researcher Comtois attempts to approach Hughes, but is quickly set upon by the rodents himself, which begin to crawl up his legs.]//

**Comtois:** I can&#39;t get near you, I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m sorry!

//[Comtois attempts to swat the rodents off his clothes, as he turns and flees the cafeteria. He is swiftly followed by the remaining researchers.]//

//[D-1812019&#39;s skull has lost most of its structural integrity yet rodents continue to emerge from the deflated skin at the top of his neck. His uniform ruptures open, releasing a flood of rodents into the room. They swiftly give chase to the fleeing researchers.]//

//[Director Hughes screams.]//

//[As the rodents clamber across his face, he covers his mouth with his hands to prevent them entering his mouth, which they constantly attempt to do. On his stomach and across his body, other rodents attempt tear at his skin with their paws and teeth.]//

//[One rodent bites Hughes&#39; left hand, instinctively causing him to jerk it away from his face. Taking advantage of this, another rodent scurries into Hughes&#39; mouth. His throat bulges as it makes its way down his throat.]//

//[As soon as this has occurred, the rodents, en masse, leave the cafeteria via a variety of exits. D-1812019 has been reduced to a small pile of blood and viscera on the cafeteria floor. The rodents exiting the cafeteria via the south corridor encounter three members of site security who have been called to the team. Whilst they open fire, they are quickly overwhelmed by the number of rodents.]//

//[Site Director Hughes&#39; body convulses as it is lifted into the air by an invisible force. It halts, levitating, as it begins to discharge rodents in a similar manner to D-1812019.]//

[[/div]]

Estimates formed from CCTV footage place the number of rodents emitted from both D-1812019 and Site Director Hughes between 1200 and 1700 instances.

Sounds of movement and squeaking are audible from within SCP-6668-1.
