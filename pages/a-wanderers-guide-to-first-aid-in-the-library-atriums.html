//You trudge past the rows of towering shelves, trying to find your way out of the maze you&#39;ve been lost in these last few days. Although you can see the vague forms of other patrons moving in the skies above, the shelves themselves seem infinite in stature. Lazily, you run your fingers across the spines of the books as you walk along. You stop when you see something approaching from the corner of your eye. From somewhere beyond the shelves, a neatly folded paper airplane gently floats down and lands by your feet. You unfold the paper and begin to read.//

[[div class=&#34;paper&#34;]] 
From the office of the Wanderers&#39; Library chief medical officer: Dr. Norine Ray

Can&#39;t you smell that fresh air? That perfect gentle breeze makes you want to run outside, find a shady spot and enjoy a nice book, doesn&#39;t it? Well, the Wanderers&#39; Library may not have any &#39;outdoor&#39; spots per se, but there are plenty of atriums and open-air spaces you may visit! But just because there&#39;s plenty of air space doesn&#39;t mean the skies will always be clear of danger. As always, this guide is your key to avoiding any ailments during your stay here.

Wing Rot:

Our Pages are very hardworking, and seeing them leap across the shelves is a sight to behold. But sometimes the Library takes it upon itself to move things around (A bit of reorganizing can do wonders, after all). Perhaps you&#39;ve been one of the lucky wanderers&#39; who have seen the books floating through the air, going from shelf to shelf?

A keen-eyed patron may notice that the books aren&#39;t truly floating, but are instead moving along a transparent chute of magical energy. Wing Rot is a common consequence of organic material traveling through these high-energy chutes. Bones, feathers, and skin rapidly deteriorate, each quickly becoming flaky and brittle. Not only can this prevent flight and lead to broken, useless bodies, but prolonged exposure can lead to disintegration. A dusty bookshelf can be acceptable, but not if you&#39;re becoming the dust yourself! There are both naturally occurring instances and artificial chutes found throughout the Library, so do be careful,as they tend to pop up when you least expect them. We offer physical therapy for any affected patrons, but keep an eye on the sky. Avoiding these chutes in the first place is your best course of action.

-----
Eagle Eye Syndrome:

Maintaining healthy eyesight can be vital for continuing to enjoy your reading time ( for those Wanderers&#39; that have eyes!). That&#39;s why contracting Eagle Eye can be such a bother.

Marked by a sudden change in pupil- and in rare cases eye- shape. Eagle Eye Syndrome is a spontaneous genetic mutation that alters the visual capabilities of the afflicted. Some of the most common results of catching Eagle Eye include: Telescopic vision up to 15 times the typical species limitations. Gaining 360-degree vision( which often results in severe vertigo) or blindness as a result of the optical nerves being unable to process the new input from the altered eyes. Thankfully, Eagle Eye Syndrome doesn&#39;t become permanent until 10 days after first exposure, and resting and covering the eyes for 3 continuous days will revert any changes. So ready that blindfold and find a book-buddy to help you around and you&#39;ll be back to normal in no time!

*Some cultures are known to have rituals to purposefully induce Eagle Eye Syndrome, allowing for controlled and unique outcomes. Popular among warriors and assassins alike, these rituals have been known to produce results not commonly found in nature such as thermal and X-ray vision. Ask your nearest Librarian for more reading materials if you&#39;re interested in learning more about these rituals.

Tumble Gut:

Have you ever had that tingling, weightless feeling in your belly as you move through the air? If that sensation lasts more than 4 hours you should seek out a healthcare provider, because you may have come down with a case of Tumble Gut. A condition that only afflicts naturally flightless species using unnatural means of flight( magical spells or items), Tumble Gut is a condition where one or more organs rotate and/ or vibrate. Not only is this quite uncomfortable, but this can lead to blood flow complications, muscle spasms, neural degradation and ultimately death.

Tumble Gut&#39;s severity is entirely dependent on the physiology of the individual. Those patrons who can freely discard their affected organs are encouraged to do so, with disposal bins being provided free of charge. Vibration belts are used to cancel out the vibrations of the organs and return said organs to their rightful place until such a time the body overcomes this condition. These belts are widely available for rent and purchase through many vendors within the library. Just make sure to keep your belt charged or you’ll be right back where you started.

Air Hazards:

The Library is a place of wonders and magic untold. But all these fantastical elements make it easy to forget the more mundane threats to one&#39;s health the Library has in store. In order to keep the room comfortable for everyone, numerous open air spaces and atriums filter and clean the air through the use of a series of giant vents and fans. These vents, however, have been known to do a little more than just cycle the air. Unfortunate patrons who stray too close have been known to be sucked in. It goes without saying we don&#39;t want to see anyone get hurt, but think of the poor Pages who have to clean up the mess you&#39;d leave behind!

And of course, Wanderers&#39; should be mindful of their airspace, regardless if they&#39;re on the ground or in the air. Mid-flight collisions can result in serious falls. Likewise dropping something from extreme elevations can be devastating for fellow wanderers on the ground. Perhaps a stern breeze blowing through the swaying tower shelves could knock some books down, causing an avalanche of books, pummeling any wanderers’ who stand below. Simply being mindful of what&#39;s around( or above) you could save your life

*I feel the need to personally emphasize the importance of this last point, in light of recent events. Since the [[[Ambrose Wanderers&#39; Library|Ambrose restaurant]]] was established in the rafters, we&#39;ve had a concerning number of reports of patrons being struck by plummeting food waste and tableware. Watching someone get splattered with a discarded portion of Fire Chili may be humorous to the unknowing onlooker, but split craniums and concussions are no laughing matter. While Library staff have reprimanded the Ambrose management for improperly disposing of their waste, I implore any readers to be careful in the meantime.

With all this in mind, you&#39;ll be soaring to new educational heights in no time! We hope the information in this guide will help keep you safe the next time you swoop by the Library. Don&#39;t forget to keep an eye out for our other guides on your visit!

Happy Reading!

*This pamphlet is for general instruction only. The Wanderers’ Library takes no official responsibility for any disease, natural illness, or injuries a patron may experience during their stay here. The Wanderers’ Library does not encourage, nor dissuade non-flying patrons from climbing any bookshelf to retrieve the book they want, regardless of that shelf&#39;s height. There is no magic to cushion falls from the tops of the shelves to the ground. Please exercise common sense and refrain from jumping off the shelves. Visit these areas at your own risk. Please consult your healthcare provider if you have any questions about the contents of this guide or schedule an appointment with one of our physicians today.

//It&#39;s not here either. You assumed when you couldn&#39;t find your prize in the deepest depths that it could be hidden among the greatest heights. Of course, it wouldn’t be so simple. But you feel you’re on the right track. As you travel ever deeper into its halls, the veil begins to thin. There aren’t that many more places the Library could hide it from you. Time to keep moving…//
