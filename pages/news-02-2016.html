Welcome to this installment of site news, the only news outlet that you follow that can afford to not be updated on time and get away with it! This is a series showing off news from the site, articles from the past month, and fancontent for you to check out and discover! Be sure to leave a comment with your thoughts!

+++ On-Site News

++++ Featured Articles

* The featured articles for this month are [[[SCP-2314]]] (&#34;Проект Стебельчатый Глаз&#34;) by [[*user Dr Nikolaus]] and [[*user Crayne]], and [[[Loyal to the Cause]]] by [[*user Erku]]. One&#39;s about a roundworm that suppresses your immune system in unexpected ways, and the other is about a Foundation employee being put to the test. Check them out!
* The featured articles from last month were [[[SCP-1431]]] (&#34;Scavenger Hunt!&#34;) by [[*user UglyFlower]] and [[[A Visitation]]] by [[*user AssertiveRoland]]. One&#39;s about an odd scavenger hunt that gives you some... odd goals to complete, and the other is about a wealthy man who wants to chat about an infamous book of his. Check them out if you missed them!

++++ Rest of the News

* The [[[Mobile Task Force Contest]]] posting period has ended, and we&#39;ve got a range of great entries! I&#39;m very happy with how the contest turned out, and hopefully, all of you are as well. Go peruse the entries!
* The [[[foundation-tales|tales]]] hub has been reorganized! The layout will be a bit different, and updates twice a week instead of automatically, but should still be as accessible as before. You can also now browse tale entries by title, in addition to still being able to browse by author and by year.
* The 2nd Annual [[[scpfmmdbc-hub|SCP Foundation March Madness]]] competition will be starting very soon! Guts, glory, excitement, pointless bracketing! Everything you love about [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_March_Madness_%28CBS/Turner%29 March Madness], now SCP-ified!

------

Missing out on articles? Enjoy a recap on the articles from the past month. Because of how the past month has turned out, I figure it&#39;d be only sensible to separate contest articles from non-contest articles for your ease of reading. Let&#39;s start out with non-contest articles. Enjoy!
