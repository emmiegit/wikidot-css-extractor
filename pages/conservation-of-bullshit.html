Urgh. [[[scp-3176|Time travel]]]. Let me tell you about time travel.

Doing anything successfully with time travel, my friends, is like finding your way through a mirror maze using trails of breadcrumbs that you have to lay yourself. It&#39;s like doing a ten-thousand piece jigsaw puzzle where all you have to go on is a blurry photograph of an earlier edition of the puzzle, upside down and half-complete, as seen through a stained-glass window that hasn&#39;t been cleaned in months. It&#39;s like building a machine, the purpose of which is unclear, using only instructions written in Dutch and a French-to-German translation booklet, compiled by a drunk translator who wasn&#39;t fluent in either. Also, one in ten pieces are missing, and one in a hundred pieces are for a different machine entirely.

I exaggerate, of course, but only slightly -- it should at least help to convey why I retired. Over my time at the Foundation, I came to hate time-travel with a burning, firey passion. It&#39;s only really a problem because I&#39;m starting my retirement in 1999, and I&#39;m a 39-year-old (or 278, depending on how you quantify it) Task Force Commander who was/will be born in 2026.

------

People never fully retire from the Foundation. Not //really//. They usually know too much to be happy with a life of ignorance, or have been there too long for amnestics to be any use, which grants them a permanent place on the radars of countless other groups. Most opt for contract work -- occasional research for an increased salary, or the odd investigation into an extranormal event that doesn&#39;t seem to be causing too much trouble. It&#39;s for that reason that I found myself standing over a dead body, with a child staring me in the eyes with a look of surprisingly calculated suspicion for one so young.

I decided to do the obvious thing and took out a bar of chocolate, half of which I offered to the kid. Poor thing seemed pretty cut up about the whole &#39;murder&#39; issue. As he munched away, he began to talk.

&#34;Are you going to kill me?&#34;

I smiled. Kids are a lot smarter than most people give them credit for.

&#34;No, no I&#39;m not. I think this man might have been trying to, though.&#34;

I gestured to the sheet-covered mound on the floor, and the bullet hole in the wall opposite. The child, bless his heart, looked unconvinced.

&#34;Are you a policeman, then? You don&#39;t look much like a policeman.&#34;

&#34;Oh? And why is that?&#34;

&#34;You&#39;ve got a gun. Only killers and soldiers carry guns. Are you a soldier?&#34;

&#34;Hah, sort of. We detected a... well, do you know what the word &#39;temporal&#39; means?&#34;

The kid shook his head vigorously.

&#34;It means, sort of, to do with time. Something nearby isn&#39;t exactly when it should be, and I&#39;ve got to figure out what it is.&#34; I had an idea. &#34;Do you feel like helping?&#34;

He nodded, slowly, and I started to grin. &#34;Great. You can call me Dick-&#34; A smirk, which I did not appreciate, &#34;or Mr. Miguel, if you prefer. This man fired a gun at you, right, and then someone,&#34; I paused. Best to be honest here, I think. &#34;or some//thing//, stopped him. Do you have any idea what that thing looked like?&#34;

Another vigorous head-shake, and a miniature snowstorm of dandruff. &#34;No. There was... uh... weird purple light, though? Like fire, but, sort of, cold?&#34; The kid realised what he was saying and clammed up. &#34;I probably just imagined it though.&#34;

I sigh. Nothing for it, I was going to have to cut the veil. It&#39;s always easier with kids anyway -- they&#39;re much more willing to believe things, and memory-wipes work better on unformed minds.

&#34;No, no, that sounds about right. That&#39;s what we call an &#39;anomaly&#39;. It&#39;s something that, ah, shouldn&#39;t really exist, but does anyway. My job is to go around and help sort them out.&#34;

&#34;Oh, like that &#39;temporal&#39; you were talking about?&#34;

&#34;Exactly! It&#39;s an anomaly, and probably has something to do with the purple light. That sounds like exactly the kind of stupid crap,&#34; a phrase that elicited a giggle from the kid, &#34;that they&#39;d slap on to a time machine to make it seem more impressive. You&#39;ll never find a more unbearably self-centred group of nerds than temporal researchers.&#34;

&#34;Hmm. Well there was the fire, and a kind of buzzing noise, and then the man appeared.&#34;

&#34;This would be the man who died?&#34;

&#34;Yeah. He appeared, and so did another man about a second later. The second one, uh, punched the first one and then stabbed him with a sort of syringe.&#34;

&#34;And the first man, he shot at you and missed, yes? And then the other man disappeared?&#34;

&#34;Yeah.&#34;

&#34;And that&#39;s all you saw, before I got here?&#34;

The kid nodded, and looked down at his feet. I patted him on the back, and sighed.

&#34;Your parents. I expect they&#39;re probably out at the moment, right?&#34;

He murmured something that may have been &#34;shopping&#34;.

&#34;Right. Why don&#39;t you go outside for a little bit while I finish up here -- it&#39;s a lovely day, after all. I&#39;ll make sure everything&#39;s when and where it should be, and you won&#39;t have to worry about any of this any more. Sound good?&#34;

A hesitant nod, and I caught a glimpse of his face beneath a tangled mop of hair. He  looked like he was trying hard not to cry. I handed him the rest of the chocolate, and motioned him through the door. Another day, another job, another chrono-mess to sort out. I clicked my neck, and settled down to work.

------

I popped a pill -- a mild mnestic agent to counter the delayed amnestics I&#39;d stuck in the chocolate bar -- and began pacing the room. Someone (it seemed like a &#39;one&#39; at this point; &#39;thing&#39;s don&#39;t normally have the imagination for stuff like this) was screwing with time, and that upset me on a very personal level. I began examining the shelves, searching for some clue as to why someone would want to kill a kid like this, and why someone else would risk a paradox to stop them. Photographs, ornaments, books, nothing out of the ordinary. This was a normal, run-of-the mill townhouse -- Victorian, terraced, slightly messy but only in the way of all houses containing a young child. Familiar to anyone who&#39;s done any amount of fieldwork.

Extremely familiar, actually. Those photographs, those souvenirs -- oh god//damn//. I swung around, yanking the sheet off the body, revealing a face I&#39;d seen many times before. Every time I looked in a mirror, in fact. 

&#34;Fuck fuck fuck //fuck//.&#34;

I stared out of the window at the kid, who was in the process of forgetting the last hour or two.

&#34;Fuck!&#34;

I&#39;d been stupid. I should have recognised him from the haircut, to be honest: my parents were never that good at hairdressing. Of course, I went by Richard back then, so he wouldn&#39;t recognise me based on my first name, and Miguel was a pseudonym -- the most basic form of identity concealment the Foundation had on offer. I glanced at the tasteless kitten-themed calendar, which confirmed it. 2038, twelve years after my birth. Which meant that three of the four participants in this charade had been the same person. Extrapolating from that, I could only assume... ah. Hmm. Of course the murderer wouldn&#39;t be around for comment, but knowing him, or rather, knowing //me//, he/I&#39;d have left a message somewhere. I flipped over the calendar.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; You&#39;ve probably worked it out by now. Or maybe not, I don&#39;t really care. Point is, I&#39;m in a loop-catalyst timeline, which means that anything I do now can affect the overall outcome. You know that already, but I can&#39;t stress it enough. I killed me/you, which means it&#39;s technically suicide, so you don&#39;t have to worry about prosecution; a small benefit, but one worth noting.
&gt; 
&gt; It&#39;s up to you what you do now, since I&#39;ll probably be back to attempt to murder the kid in a couple years or so -- continuity, am I right? I don&#39;t know why I/you/we did it in the first place. Maybe we were blackmailed, or bribed, or just wanted to bring the timeline crashing down on our heads. In any case, you&#39;re technically investigating a paradox I&#39;ve just resolved, so you&#39;re free to go.
&gt; 
&gt; Try not to fuck everything up again,
&gt; Richard Miguel, Iteration 1, 2038 (at least for now).

I barely even noticed the body behind me disappear in a flash of self-correcting purple light as I made the decision not to kill my childhood self, and ended up never having been going back to stop me. I slumped against the wall, head pounding.

Fuck time travel.

Seriously.
