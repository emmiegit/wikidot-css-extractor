**Item #:** SCP-7685

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**
SCP-7685 is to be contained within a standard anomalous object containment chamber at Site-██. The containment chamber must be soundproofed to prevent any external audio interference. No personnel are allowed direct communication or physical contact with SCP-7865 without prior approval from at least two Level 3 researchers.

A live audio feed from SCP-7685 must be monitored at all times by assigned personnel. A log of all dialogues recorded by SCP-7865 is to be maintained for archival purposes. Personnel assigned to monitor SCP-7865&#39;s audio feed must undergo monthly psychological evaluations to ensure mental stability due to extended exposure to sensitive information.

**Description:**
SCP-7685 is a modified █████████ brand digital voice recorder. It appears to be an ordinary model externally, but its internal components have been augmented to record an individual&#39;s internal dialogue. The activation and recording process of SCP-7685 is currently unknown.

SCP-7685 The previous owner of SCP-7685 stated that it was originally discovered in his attic, alongside an extensive collection of audio recordings containing his own internal dialogue dating back six years.

When playback of SCP-7685&#39;s recorded audio is conducted, the individual&#39;s internal dialogue is heard, distinct from any external sounds or voices. The internal dialogue captured is unfiltered, revealing the subject&#39;s most intimate thoughts, fears, and desires.

SCP-7685&#39;s anomalous effect does not appear to have any adverse physical or psychological impact on the subject recorded. However, continued exposure to their own internal dialogue has led subjects to become increasingly withdrawn, anxious, and prone to insomnia, possibly due to the intrusive nature of their thoughts.

Furthermore, repeated exposure to SCP-7685&#39;s recordings may result in the subject becoming obsessed with self-reflection and existential contemplation, leading to a gradual decline in mental stability. Psychological sessions have proven effective in helping subjects manage these effects, although no known method permanently reverses the increased susceptibility to intrusive thoughts.

Research into SCP-7685&#39;s origins and the source of its anomalous properties is currently ongoing.

**Addendum:**
Due to Incident-7685-01, access to SCP-7685 is now restricted to Level 4 personnel and above. Incident-7685-01 occurred when Dr. ████ inadvertently activated SCP-7685 near Site-██&#39;s cafeteria, resulting in multiple individuals exposed to the recordings of their internal dialogue. This caused severe psychological distress in the affected individuals, leading to several self-harm incidents and a ████ casualty count. ██ personnel undergoing psychological treatments due to Incident-7685-01.</textarea></pre>
