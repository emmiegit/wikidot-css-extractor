Okay folks, we&#39;ve just had a visitor called HAGGER vandalise everything to the best of his ability.

But don&#39;t panic. Nothing is deleted. Only Admins have the ability to delete anything.

**I would like to give a big hand to resident member Snorlison who pretty much single handedly fixed most of the site. Thanks Buddy! I mean it!**

The site should be back to normal soon.

If you come across any come across any pages that aren&#39;t supposed to be that way, you can go to the bottom, hit histories, and revert the page to what it used be by hitting the &#34;R&#34; next to that version. If there is none, that means the original page has been renamed, and can be found in &#34;Site Tools&#34;, under the &#34;Orphaned pages&#34; tab. You might have to troll through it to find the page you&#39;re looking for, but it&#39;s there.

There are still images of his on some of the more obscure forum pages, but whatever you do, do not delete the page, merely delete the the post b going into edit, and wiping the entire post.

If you can&#39;t do that, contact a mod or admin, and tell them where it is.

**MEMO TO STAFF**

Dear staff,

Today, the entire foundation came under attack.  SCP was breached in multiple areas, and a untold amount of documents have been leaked.  This damage has been repaired in the majority, however the final clean-up may take months.  The full damage done may never be fully totaled.

We have been lax.  Site security has been tightened.  Such a embarrassing breach of site security will not be allowed to happen again.  Thank you for your vigilance.  

Dr.Gears

**REPORT FROM FIELD AGENT THE FRONT RUNNERS**

Staff Member Snorlison&#39;s work in the nick of time has saved the lives of Mobile Task Force Delta-5, the Front Runners. Lack of SCP data in the field in Nigeria almost killed us thanks to the server raids. Without Snorlison&#39;s devoted work, we would be either dead or in ORIA hands.

We therefore motion that an award for Honor in Service be created by the Foundation explicitly to be awarded to Snorlison. He represents the highest level of devotion to our cause, and should be recognized as such.

**WARNING: SECURITY BREACH IN PROGRESS**
**UPDATE**
Security breach now contained to the bulletin boards.  All damage has repaired and infected areas have been quarantined, though containment teams may have missed a room or two.

**WARNING: SECURITY BREACH**
**UPDATE**

More like a room or three.  Memetic hazards purged from all board posts.  File inspection still under way.

**WARNING: SECURITY BREACH**
**UPDATE:  SECURITY UNDER CONTINUED ASSAULT**

Entity has detected my continued purge of his posts; in return, it has begun to edit my own communication.  Why the hell is an anonymous entity able to modify the content of members?

**WARNING: SECURITY BREACH**
**UPDATE:  SECURITY UNDER CONTINUED ASSAULT**

I did a little investigating and found that HAGGER may or may not be the same infamous vandal known as GRAWP. Together (or he) has been vandalizing wikipedia and other wiki sites for years.  You can google the names and find countless victims of vandalism blogging and complaining in forums.
here&#39;s an example
http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=18309
http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=218128131#User:Grawp

It seems like he doesn&#39;t even have to do the work himself.  He simply recruits other users from off of 4chan to do his dirty work, which is why we&#39;ll be blocking countless IPs and users.

We all find it hard to understand how someone could be so childish that they take such incredible pleasure from words like &#34;dildo&#34; and &#34;fag.&#34;  Which is why its so painful to have to close new membership until we can resolve this issue.  It may be weeks or months, but the hardworking, dedicated members of SCP shouldn&#39;t be hindered by countless &#34;SOCKPUPPETS&#34; who have nothing better to do than type the word &#34;penis.&#34;</textarea></pre>
