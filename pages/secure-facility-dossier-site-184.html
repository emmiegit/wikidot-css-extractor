Director Barrett sat down at his desk, again. His gaze slid towards the large windows overlooking the water. &#34;Focus, focus now,&#34; he implored himself. This was his third attempt to finalize the updates to Site-184&#39;s dossier entry. He knew it wouldn&#39;t take long, but that hadn&#39;t stopped him from deferring to the other tasks he could tell himself were far more important. 

&#34;Okay, first&#39;s first,&#34; he told himself as he started typing...

So far so good. The site logo looked prim and proper. He had considered including a more specific location, but that would come later. Barrett was pretty sure the Site Identification Code was meant to be included, at least he suspected no one would mind if it were. He ran through it again in his head: **CA**nada, **N**ova **S**cotia, **H**alifax Regional **M**unicipality. 

Did he need that horizontal line though?

**Site Function:** Site-184 serves two simultaneous purposes. As the primary Research &amp; Containment site on the East Coast of Canada, it hosts cutting-edge installations such as the //Applied Metaphysics// Laboratories, the innovatively designed //Aquatic Anomalies// facilities, and the //Anomalous Art &amp; Artefacts// wing. Additionally, the Site functions as a command center and shipyard for the //SCP Foundation Naval Command:// the Foundation’s naval presence in the North Atlantic. This body is responsible for overseeing ocean-based Search &amp; Rescue, Salvage, Anomaly Containment, Force Projection, and Research operations.

**Founded:** 7 September 1908

**Founding Director:** Johnson C. Maud

**Current Director:** Roger D. Barrett

**Location:** Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia, Canada.

**Cover Story:** Site-184 operates under the facade of a marine and naval shipbuilding organization: //Ship Captain&#39;s Productions.// To maintain the feasibility of this pretext, Site-184&#39;s Shipbuilding Division will occasionally undertake commissions from the Royal Canadian Navy and independent contractors in an adjacent complex. Relevant personnel are given Level-0 Clearance: only allowing access to the shipbuilding facilities, and are unaware of the SCP Foundation or Site-184&#39;s additional purposes, but may work on construction and repair projects for Foundation vessels.

Should he include a floor plan? Barrett knew the layout of the site like the back of his hand, obviously. His office sat atop the Main-Camp: the central administrative building for the site and the home of the Naval Offices; far below him the //GOTTFRIED Applied Metaphysics Labs// were carved into the bedrock. Adjacent to the Main-Camp was the Lewis Building, hosting //Art &amp; Artefact&#39;s// climate-controlled collections facilities. Across the way was the new wing for //Aquatic Anomalies:// a collection of holding tanks and research facilities. 

The waterfront was dominated by the dry-docks, shipbuilding facilities, and barracks. Barrett could see the naval and research vessels moored at the docks beyond, flags snapping in the wind. He would have loved to be out on his afternoon walk. Shortly, he promised himself, as he placed a request for the floor-plans to someone in Admin. Wondering how close his recreation of those plans would be, Barrett pulled over a notebook and quickly sketched an outline of the site&#39;s main buildings:

[[=image Plan2.jpg]]


God that was atrocious, he admitted. Somewhat ashamed, Barrett flipped the page over and turned his focus towards the departments of Site-184 themselves:

**Responsibilities:** Aquatic Anomalies undertakes the containment and research of various biological, marine entities. In addition, they are responsible for investigating how such entities influence the marine biosphere and human interactions with such spaces. Due to the nature of these anomalies, physical containment within a Foundation facility is occasionally infeasible as a long-term solution. In such an event, the department is responsible for tracking the anomaly within its environment and mitigating its interaction with general human populations.

Department personnel have also received permission to utilize the facilities for the rehabilitation of non-anomalous marine life, provided this does not interfere with their primary responsibilities.

One step closer, Barrett reflected. A piece of paper on the desk caught his eye. Taking a moment&#39;s break from the screen he looked it over: a flyer that Greg Albsernester had been putting up around the site advertising for his fishing club...

In all honesty, Barrett found the offer of a weekend off to enjoy some fishing more enticing than he would have preferred. Recent events had put a strain on the already at-times fraught relationship between the Navy and on-site Research groups; the former, as usual, wanted more autonomy in their operations and the latter more funding for the work they&#39;ve been doing. Keeping the admiralty and department heads happy, while still ensuring the site stayed afloat, had become more and more taxing as the years stacked on. 

At least Applied Metaphysics didn&#39;t kick up much of a fuss, although -- Barrett acknowledged -- that was likely in no small part because of the O5s&#39; perpetual stamp of approval on whatever they needed. 

On the note of years past, this seemed an appropriate time to draw attention to the site&#39;s history -- or at least as much of it he felt like including at the moment:

@@            @@Following the dissolution of the [[[unusual-cargo-hub|Commission on Unusual Cargo]]], who had maintained a presence in Nova Scotia for much of the organization&#39;s history, the port city of Halifax quickly became a major smuggling route for anomalous items and persons. While the city itself was merely a transitionary port, the porous land border between Canada and the United States provided the opportunity for illicit, anomalous goods to be both extracted from and imported to North America. 

@@            @@The Foundation, under pressure to stem the tide of this exchange -- which was frequently exploited by anomalous crime syndicates such as the [[[chicago-spirit|Chicago Spirit]]] -- assigned Johnson C. Maud as head of an anti-smuggling task force stationed out of the Halifax peninsula. Maud&#39;s forceful and at-times violent interventions led to the successful interruption of smuggling operations, which gradually reduced the activities of international anomalous criminal organizations within the province&#39;s borders.

@@            @@During the raids conducted by Maud, a large number of anomalous items, artworks, and biological specimens were acquired by the Foundation. While associated criminals and humanoids were transferred to, and detained in, purpose-built containment facilities in Western-Central Canada, the aforementioned items were retained within the city of Halifax itself, in a collection of storehouses operated by the Foundation.

@@            @@On December 6^^th^^, 1917, two vessels collided in the Halifax harbour, igniting the explosive material on-board and resulting in a destructive blast that crippled most of Halifax and the surrounding communities.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Referred to as the &#39;Halifax Explosion,&#39; this blast was the largest, publically-known, non-anomalous, human-caused explosion at the time.[[/span]] The aforementioned storehouses used by the Foundation were badly damaged, and Maud -- after employing Foundation assets for the reconstruction of the city -- established Site-184 along the rural Nova Scotian coastline, moving the previously acquired anomalous items into the new location. 

@@            @@After Maud&#39;s retirement during the Second World War, the subsequent site Director: Carl Lennes -- a veteran of the Royal Canadian Navy prior to his service for the Foundation -- advocated for the establishment of a Foundation naval presence at Site-184. Lennes was instrumental in constructing Site-184&#39;s cover story of being a naval shipyard and ensured the site grew from a costal-adjacent containment facility to a major naval port for the Foundation. Criticisms levied at Lennes suggest he ignored the initial purpose of the site: reducing funding and support for research initiatives and frequently transferring anomalous items to other Foundation facilities. Yet the usefulness of Site-184 as a base for Foundation naval operations has been proven several times over -- both during Lennes&#39; time and beyond. 

-----

@@            @@In recent years, Site-184 has focussed on balancing these two sets of responsibilities. The establishment of new facilities for the Department of Anomalous Art &amp; Artefacts and Aquatic Anomalies has solidified the importance of research alongside containment in the Foundation&#39;s day-to-day affairs. Simultaneously, leaps and bounds have been achieved through the experimentation of paratechnolgies in attempts to amplify the Foundation&#39;s Naval forces. 

@@            @@Whatever the future holds, whatever challenge lies beyond the horizon, the personnel stationed at Site-184 stand ready: prepared to Secure tomorrow for the Foundation, Contain and research biological and historical anomalies, and Protect the human populace, both locally and globally.

That last bit, Barrett admitted, was a little too dramatic. He highlighted the text, preparing to delete it, when he paused. So what if it was a little too personal or optimistic -- Barrett was proud of the site: he was proud of the people who worked here and all that they&#39;d done. He had seen brilliant minds dedicated to protecting humanity against any foes, witnessed breakthroughs that changed his vision of the future, and research that unearthed forgotten secrets of the past. 

This was his home, and the people here were like family -- they may not be perfect, no family was -- but they had been good to him over the long years. And he owed it to those both here and gone to stand by them. 

As he hit &#39;save&#39; and grabbed his coat, Barrett took another look out the expansive windows. It might not be smooth sailing ahead, but he was determined to stand by the helm no matter what. And, he admitted, no matter what happened, there was nowhere he&#39;d rather make his stand than here, where the sea meets the shore, at Site-184.
