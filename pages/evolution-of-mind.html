Prometheus stole fire from the gods to bestow upon mankind. It is a tale that I often find myself relating to when I remember it. Like the titan, I paid a price.

//&#34;Green! Are you alright? Fuck! Get him to the medical bay! Now!&#34;//

That machine at Prometheus Labs was a failure, but it did confirm that the human mind had power. I saw it myself. Numerous objects were bent by my will in an instant. I twisted the flesh of my co-workers in any way I chose, from a neanderthal to something far, far ahead before reverting back. Their thoughts were completely open to me for probing. For a brief moment, I ascended into the next stage of human evolution, but I suffered for my glimpse into godhood. Regardless, I continued to perform my research with the aid of interested parties.

//&#34;Dr. Green?&#34;//

//&#34;Y-y-yes, Greg? Still N-no progress?&#34;//

//&#34;I am afraid so. Brain activity is the same in each subject. The equipment from Prometheus Labs still say there is no telekenetic energy. The subjects feel the same.&#34;//

//&#34;I-increase the s-stimulation t-time to f-four h-hours. M-maybe add m-more c-compound 19 i-in the food. In a w-week t-there should b-be results.&#34;//

//&#34;Yes, sir. Do you need anything before I leave?&#34;//

//&#34;T-that will b-be all. Bye.&#34;//

There were fifteen subjects, all of whom were children grown in a lab through a leftover Prometheus project. They had minor flaws as a result of their unnatural birth, but otherwise they were normal. My DNA was used with others to create them in the hopes it will increase their chances of unlocking their mind like I had. They were set to be the future, however, never to be my children.

//&#34;Mr. Green, do we have mommies and daddies, too?&#34;//

It was a hard question to answer but it was necessary.

//&#34;I am s-sorry, F-four.&#34;//

They were only evolution&#39;s children, the subjects of a new tommorow. Nothing else. My job was to see them succeed. That was good enough for me. 

//&#34;Subject Five has shown some progress, Dr. Green. She has demonstrated organic manipulation but it is very limited at its current state. She is only able to change hair color.&#34;//

//&#34;T-the others?&#34;//

//&#34;Nothing yet, sir.&#34;&#34;//

//&#34;K-keep on g-going t-then. W-we are so c-close!&#34;//

[https://web.archive.org/web/20210325093919/https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-040 Subject Four] was a young girl. She seemed to enjoy her developing power as she made new beings with just her will. Each organism was unique in appearance. It was like they came from an alien planet, but they were like something a child would imagine if they were allowed to play god. The creatures also acted like loyal pets, and they made her happy. It was sad to take them away from her for dissection. I sometimes wish I told her it was a gift --from Dad.--

No, I was not her father. Not to anyone. I was just a genetic template. Such behavior would be unprofessional of me, but... I still felt proud.

//&#34;Subject Four made a symbiotic organism today that she wears like a jacket. She still struggles to manipulate plants, but that could change with further enhancements.&#34;//

//&#34;G-good. H-have the o-others p-p-progressed?&#34;//

//&#34;No, sir. Although we should be close to seeing them developing into the next stage.&#34;//

I really wanted the others to catch up with Four. It would&#39;ve been interesting to see how their minds would&#39;ve developed. Unfortunately, there was not enough time for me to see them flourish.

//&#34;Dr. Green, we are here to escort you! The facility is compromised!&#34;//

//&#34;The s-subjects-&#34;//

//&#34;No time, sir! Gotta go!&#34;//

I thought the Coalition found me, but someone else did. They were everywhere and I suspected escape was not possible, even if the security team fired chemical weapons.

I turned out to be right. Bullets pierced through my old body, and left me in a pool of blood surrounded by corpses. My vision faded to black, and now I am slipping into the darkness while reminiscing.

It&#39;s peaceful. Be good, children. Especially you, Four. Our evolution is in your hands now.
