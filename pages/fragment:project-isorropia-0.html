**Vol 1**

**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/project-isorropia/offset/1|Vol 2]]]**


Due to the efficacy of SCP-001 containment cycles, it has been determined by the High Council that a secondary site may be authorized for the perpetual arrest of anomalies. Project Isorropía is intended for research staff to propose containment cycles for such entities or phenomena. Personnel are reminded to append their name or codename to their proposals.

+++ Researchers who wish to submit a new entry should use the following link **[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/fragment:project-isorropia-1|here]]]**.


||~ SCP Designation||~ SCP Designation||~ Containment Method||
||[[[SCP-035]]] - A mask styled after the comedy/tragedy theater masks, which secretes a corrosive fluid. Item is sapient and is capable of controlling individuals who wear it.||[[[SCP-096]]] - An emaciated humanoid that will seek out and kill any individual who has seen its face in any non-artistic depiction.||SCP-035 covers most of SCP-096&#39;s face; portions that are not fully covered are obfuscated by the corrosive substance. Due to SCP-035 continually &#39;seeing&#39; SCP-096&#39;s face, SCP-096 constantly attempts to claw it off, preventing SCP-035 from taking full control. {{- I. H. Pickman}}||
||[[[SCP-3935|]]] - An extra-temporal, extra-spatial, non-Euclidean space under Salvation High School in Salvation, Indiana. Anomaly exerts severe spatial, audiovisual, hallucinatory effects on its surrounding.||[[[SCP-4012|]]] - A large extra-dimensional space resembling Earth, with significant deviations. Elements within SCP-4012 have a memetic effect which drastically impact viewers psychologically.||For a brief, infinitesimal point in time, griefs and regrets strip away beneath the starlight&#39;s gaze. You don&#39;t let go, and the quiet madness returns a deafening silence.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]This statement has been flagged for potential memetic corruption.[[/span]] {{- S. Yvonne}}||
||[[[SCP-4910]]] - Dental quadruped with infectious properties involving the production of teeth. Reproductive hazard targets personnel.||[[[SCP-5648]]] - An elderly man who is perceived to be a member of the Foundation. Using this memetic camouflage, it assaults personnel to commandeer their teeth.||The pair are embroiled in a dentalkinetic mating embrace. This involves SCP-5648 consuming itself as new mouths are formed due to SCP-4910&#39;s effect. Once its mass has eaten itself, it emerges from SCP-4910 to extract more of its teeth, incorporating them into its upper pallet. {{- S D Locke}}||
||[[[SCP-718]]] - A large eye propelled by a prehensile stalk. It follows living subjects with its gaze, imparting feelings of paranoia and discomfort in subjects. When damaged, SCP-718 explodes. Duplicates of the entity will grow from all objects touched by the liquid produced by its detonation.||[[[SCP-689]]] - A green soapstone statue carved in a skeletal visage. When left unobserved, it will vanish. An individual who has previously viewed SCP-689 will spontaneously die, with SCP-689 reappearing on their corpse.||Instances of SCP-718 positioned on mummified human corpses, in a triangular pattern around SCP-689. Occasionally, all instances will simultaneously look away, causing SCP-689 to manifest on and terminate the SCP-718 instances, which will cause additional SCP-718 to form. Instances of SCP-718 will then resume observation, manipulating SCP-689 back to its original position via the eye stalks. {{- Anonymous}}||
||[[[SCP-682]]] - A hostile organism resembling a giant lizard that is able to alter its physiology to counteract threats. Inimical to the existence of life.||[[[sandrewswann-s-proposal|SCP-001-SWANN]]] - A series of beings on a plane of existence above our own who are capable of altering the state of reality through the act of writing.||Refer to [[[Experiment-Log-T-98816-oc108-682]]] {{- S D Locke}}||
||[[[SCP-2553]]]: A legal, corporate person produced by a complex multi-jurisdictional tax filing; it alters and files legal documents to acquire various powers, with which it arbitrarily disrupts normalcy.||[[[SCP-4703]]]: A **perfectly legal** grocery store possessing several mechanisms for injuring and inconveniencing customers; the business is unable to be prosecuted due to a semiosic anomaly rendering it conceptually legal.||{{CASE VERDICT: &#34;SCP-2553 et. al vs. Y. W. T. G. T. S. Y. T.&#34;}} _
 _
 SCP-2553 is the parent of various subsidiary corporations engaging in ongoing legal proceedings with the Defendant, thereby restricting its ability to effectively argue its behaviors as &#39;perfectly legal&#39;. The Defendant has initiated countersuits in all cases, providing SCP-2553 with a &#39;satisfactory volume of challenge&#39; such that it does not breach pre-existing contract with the Foundation. {{- P. H. McPhD.}}||
||[[[SCP-2470]]] - An entity or element which manifest as the initial stage of a ZK-Class scenario. Capable of erasing objects, events and/or concepts it has &#39;perceived&#39;.||[[[SCP-3930]]] - A static void located near Usinsk, Russia. It does not exist, or contains any properties that would qualify for such status.||SCP-2470 continually attempts to &#39;deduce&#39; SCP-3930, but fails due to the latter&#39;s non-existence. SCP-3930&#39;s perceived properties are unable to stabilize in response to SCP-2470&#39;s perception. As a result, the effects of both on reality have largely diminished. {{- S. Yvonne}}||
||[[[SCP-2700]]] - A device which, when it becomes capable of firing, will reverse entropy, essentially causing time to change directions and flow backwards.||[[[SCP-5510]]] - A TV remote capable of changing its subjective flow of time.||SCP-2700 and SCP-5510 appear to nullify one anothers&#39; effects, causing time to flow in the entropic-decay direction despite both devices&#39; activation. How this could have been achieved is not currently clear. {{- Y. Leiner}}||
||[[[SCP-3977]]] - A mixture of various natural and artificial ingredients (including fruit juices and purees as well as artificial colors and flavors), marketed as soft drink Hawaiian Punch. Large amounts of the mixture anomalously emit television broadcast signals. Though its documentation classifies the anomaly as Euclid, recent moves by Dr. Pepper Snapple Group Inc. to drastically increase production of Hawaiian Punch have led to its reclassification to Keter.||[[[SCP-5841]]] - An extremely hostile artificially intelligent entity with antimemetic properties, capable of taking control of electronics and humans in its vicinity. Though its documentation currently classifies the anomaly as Euclid, concerns raised over the entity&#39;s possible capacity for propagation through the Internet led to its being reclassified to Keter.||SCP-5841 has been implemented as a key element in a factory and bottling facility dedicated to the production of SCP-3977. Constant broadcast signals from within SCP-3977 overwhelm SCP-5841&#39;s control over its components, and direct all electronic equipment and personnel under its command to dedicate themselves to the production and distribution of Hawaiian Punch; conversely, the antimemetic field generated by SCP-5841 prevents any broadcasts produced by SCP-3977 from being transmitted outside the confines of the facility. {{- T. Y. Umen}}||

||[[[SCP-6791]]] - A non-corporeal, ontokinetic, and parasitic entity. SCP-6791 pairs itself with individuals for various lengths of time, primarily within the cranial area of the current host (known hereafter as Subject-6791). SCP-6791 will incrementally alter the neurology of Subject-6791 and all individuals Subject-6791 is aware of to experience behavioral changes that result in affected individuals to resemble character archetypes in a Young Adult Fantasy/Adventure Narratives, with Subject-6791 as the protagonist. The process leads to neurological degradation, especially for Subject-6791 and SCP-6791 will leave its current host after the host has experienced a significant loss of interest, personality, and empathy and if SCP-6791 is unable to form narratives while in Foundation custody.||[[[SCP-5824]]] - A large, leather bound book weighing approximately one kilogram. The cover is unmarked aside from signs of weathering. If any individual makes contact with SCP-5824, they become an instance of SCP-5824-1.

SCP-5824 will through ontokinetic means, alter the personality of SCP-5824-1 and give them innate knowledge of SCP-5824-2&#39;s location and the means to reach them. SCP-5824-1 will be granted abilities to help it engage SCP-5824-2 in physical combat, which will always lead to a &#34;victory condition&#34;. After which SCP-5824-1 will lose any abilities or personality changes except for an increase in confidence. SCP-5824 itself will have its pages filled with text describing SCP-5824-1&#39;s thoughts and actions.||Following the recover of Subject-6791-54, SCP-6791-54 is indoctrinated into the belief that &#34;The Foundation of Humanity&#34; is an thaumaturgical organization that protects humanity from various anomalies and anomalous Groups of Interest. SCP-6791-54 is also to be informed that she is the only individual who can use SCP-5824. SCP-6791, though ontokinetic means has weakened SCP-5824, to only allow for Subject-6791-54 to partially defeat enemy organizations. SCP-5824 has in turn negated Subject-6791-54&#39;s neurological degradation, and grants her the abilities necessary to overcome challenges. Feeding the narratives to SCP-5824. {{-Professor Mint}}||

||[[[wmdd-s-proposal|SCP-001-WMDD]]] - An attempt by the Foundation to defend mainline reality from the extradimensional threat known as THE WORM, which consumes realities. The project consists of using the Altis engine to create several mirror realities for THE WORM to consume.||[[[mackenzie-s-proposal|SCP-001-MACKENZIE]]] - A machine developed by [DATA EXPUNGED], the Administrator. The Administrator came from a timeline in which humanity was extremely advanced and had learned to alter the very fabric of reality. However, this caused the Corruption, a damaging of reality which consumes worlds and creates anomalies. If the machine were to ever be used, it is believed that it would stop the Corruption. However, the Administrator died before he could finish it.||After using the Altis Engine to create several timelines in which SCP-001-MACKENZIE was completed, THE WORM attempted to consume them. Activation of the device has undone the damage to those timelines and also halted the spread of the Corruption to other worlds. This has neutralized both threats as only Corrupted worlds are consumed, but only one Corrupted world now exists, continually renewing itself for THE WORM to eat. {{-Dr. Neil Leinnes}}||
||[[[SCP-1055]]] - An anomalous entity that superficially resembles a specimen of //Ursus arctos horribilis//. By default it takes the appearance of a highly realistic teddy bear. SCP-1055 is an infohazard, when individuals in close proximity to it are made aware of its dangerous anomalous properties it will rapidly morph into a immense monstrous entity with additional sensory organs and appendages and display hostility towards humanity. The rate of growth is directly correlated with the number of individuals and the amount of fear they have towards SCP-1055.||[[[SCP-2410]]] - refers to stuffed bears that have experienced an ectoentropic phenomenon wherein the materials that previously filled the bears are instantaneously replaced with anatomically correct internals for a bear of that size. This includes muscle tissue, bone, a complete set of internal organs, a circulatory system, and bodily fluids such as blood and bile. Despite possessing a complete and working anatomy, no biological processes take place within the bears and none of the organ systems connect to external orifices.||SCP-1055 has become affected by the SCP-2410 phenomenon while in its docile state, replacing its internal stuffing with biological organs and tissue. This has resulted in SCP-1055&#39;s anomalous properties being inverted. When individuals are made aware of SCP-1055&#39;s dangerous properties, SCP-1055 will grow, but its organs and muscle tissue will be replaced with stuffing, making it physically incapable of moving and harming people aware of it. Conversely, knowledge of SCP-1055 has limited SCP-2410 replacement of internal components to SCP-1055 as it continues to infinitely replace SCP-1055&#39;s internal components instead of the internal components of other stuffed bears. {{-Professor Mint}}||

SCP-6804 has in turn proven to be highly susceptible to SCP-2851&#39;s influence. However, SCP-6804 since eating is not an activity encouraged by SCP-2851 and SCP-6804 is physically incapable of performing the other activities, SCP-2851 has effectively neutralized SCP-6804&#39;s anomalous properties and will continue to do so as long as it effects documents affected by SCP-6804.## {{-Professor Mint}}||

SCP-1111-1 is incorporeal, possesses anomalous speed, strength and awareness, and is translucent. It is bonded to SCP-1111-2, a human corpse hanging from a noose. Movements by the corpse depend on the proximity between itself and SCP-1111-1.||Agent █████ was transported to the SCP-1111 containment site and made clear of the event. Agent █████ proceeded to approach SCP-1111-2 with SCP-607 still in its mobile containment chamber[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Because of SCP-1111-1s initial behavior, the chamber was reinforced and outfitted to be operated by a canine.[[/span]]. As expected, SCP-1111-1 became hostile and killed both. After a period of 24 hours, SCP-607 reanimated in its mobile chamber, and made direct eye contact with SCP-1111-2. Following this, the behavior of both anomalies have changed significantly; in the event one of the life support systems for SCP-607 begin to fail or run out, SCP-1111-1 will non aggressively seek out the nearest replacement component before repairing it through rudimentary means. SCP-607 in return will attempt to occasionally breach its chamber, in which point SCP-1111-1 will gently return it to its chamber before it can harm itself.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]SCP-607 will often attempt to resist these attempts, but due to the incorporeal nature of SCP-1111-1, these attempts are usually futile.[[/span]] SCP-1111-2 has been observed to have decreased jerking motions, and has been observed to have a calmer facial expression.

||[[[SCP-3167]]] - A pataphysical entity which manifests in narratives which share a single, common universe or protagonist, such as novel series, canons of short stories, or larger mythos works. The entity will appear in narratives and assassinate a major character, greatly altering the subsequent narrative from how it would originally play out. Its manifestation is announced by a variation of the phrase &#34;The unusually tall figure with a horrible, white grin raised its weapon, ready for the kill&#34; appearing.||[http://fondationscp.wikidot.com/scp-482-fr SCP-482-FR] - A metafictional entity that adopts the appearance of the Roman general Caius Julius Caesar, it can be introduced in cinematographic media related to fantasy or the paranormal to later modify the story to discredit the fanciful events.

Several D-class members were used to play the characters and a security guard as SCP-3167[[/span]], later, by esoteric means, SCP-482-FR was attracted to the tape in order to check if it was able to negate the effects of the other entity, as a result while SCP-482-FR tries to prove that the fictitious events are false, a voiceover stated that SCP-3167&#39;s activation phrase, before SCP-482-FR can discredit this fact SCP-3167 manifests and kills SCP-482-FR 23 times, after this, the narrative continued with relative normality with minor changes, in later appearances of other works when SCP-482-FR tries to intervene in another work it is quickly approached by the other entity that ends with its elimination, due to the fact that the objective of SCP-3167 has been completed this withdrawn without making major changes is in the overall narrative, due to this it is believed that the reason SCP-3167 follows SCP-482-FR is because its ability to change the narrative for the better can make it angry which results in it actively attempting to eliminate it thereby preventing interfere with other works of fiction, in turn it has been seen that the manifestations of SCP-482-FR have been considerably reduced.

||[[[SCP-2085]]] - The “Black Rabbit Company”, a anarchist/terrorist group consisting of six cybernetically enhanced individuals; SCP-2085-A, a group of five female humans possessing cybernetic attachments resembling the physiology of //Felis catus//, and SCP-2085-B, a human male wearing an S1035 ACES, bathrobe and wizard’s hat, as well as having SCP-2085-1 - a supposedly sentient mass of self-replicating carbon nanomaterials - infused within them. Prior to containment, SCP-2085 was responsible for various crimes[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Including but not limited to: kidnapping, fraud, distribution of anomalous items, and tax evasion.[[/span]], typically targeting Groups of Interest (including the Foundation), other organized crime groups, and (albeit rarely) persons of military and/or governmental influence. SCP-2085 has been uncooperative and hostile with the Foundation, making numerous failed escape attempts during their time in containment and possessing a vocal desire to “get to space”.||[[[SCP-1915]]] - A middle-aged white male that alters reality around it, including the structure of buildings and vehicles[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]For example, transforming a MTF transport vehicle into a city bus.[[/span]], to match its personal status-quo as an office worker for the now-defunct ██████ Corporation. No outside force will be capable of changing SCP-1915’s status-quo in any meaningful way. Interviews with SCP-1915 indicate that it is both incapable of controlling and unaware of its anomalous effects, as well as the circumstances of its containment. Interviews also indicate that SCP-1915 possesses a level of discomfort with its current life, but has not made any significant effort to change it.||Following SCP-2085’s 5th containment breach of the year, the order was given by Dir. Pishroy to decommission it. SCP-2085 was forcibly introduced into a highly-secure containment chamber with SCP-1915 at Site-01. Within the first few hours, SCP-2085 made several attempts to breach the containment cell, most spearheaded by SCP-2085-A-1, all of which resulted in failure. SCP-1915 does not appear to notice the escape attempts and professionally introduces themself to SCP-2085, before attempting to engage in small talk with them. None of the members of SCP-2085 respond, causing SCP-1915 to repeat his question several times before SCP-2085-A-4 violently lashes out at him in frustration, causing SCP-1915 to step back and apologize. After ~5 hours, SCP-1915’s effects become noticeable on SCP-2085 and appear to intensify: Members of SCP-2085 begin having their cybernetic enhancements gradually deteriorate until disappearing, though this appears to cause no harm to the physiology of the members. In addition, their clothes begin to become more akin to a traditional work dress, with SCP-2085&#39;s S1035 ACES being replaced with a collared white shirt and jeans. SCP-2085 becomes less motivated to escape, instead displaying signs of intense fear and dread at their transformations. SCP-2085-A-3 begins screaming to the interior roof camera, viciously insulting the Foundation and demanding for the door to be opened. Onset of mental amnesia occurs after ~7 hours, after all cybernetic enhancements (including SCP-2085-1) have demanifested, when SCP-2085-A-5 displays confusion about their location. Over the course of the next 10 hours, despite numerous attempts by SCP-2085-A to retain them, they gradually lose their memories of any anomalous phenomena, including their crimes, their modifications, each other, and SCP-2085-B, instead having these replaced by typical memories of a non-anomalous human being growing up in Japan. SCP-2085-B is not affected, presumably due to their non-anomalous upbringing, instead reacting with horror at SCP-2085-A’s gradual loss of memory. At ~T=18:00:00, All members of SCP-2085-A are indistinguishable from non-anomalous Japanese civilians, both physically and mentally. SCP-2085-B’s attempts to make SCP-2085-A remember are met with confusion and apathy. SCP-1915 does not appear to notice and engages in small talk with SCP-2085-A, this time without incident. Upon release from the containment area, SCP-2085-B attacked attending researchers, yelling “What did you do to them!?” before being forced to ingest an Amnestic that targeted memories of SCP-2085. After the procedure was done, SCP-1915 also showed no anomalous effects, likely as a counterbalance to SCP-2085. All involved entities have since been reintroduced into public life under fabricated identities. {{- Dir. P. S. Pishroy}}||

Infected individuals have their tissues and organs gradually converted into an &#34;organic metal,&#34; forming complex machinery to replace the original biological function. The infection also greatly diminishes the subject&#39;s mental state, making their actions repetive and mechanical. ||Cross-testing of samples of SCP-217 with individuals suffering from late-stage infection of SCP-610 was approved following extensive research by Foundation doctors specializing in anomalous pathology and tactical theology. The test was conducted in an airlocked, sterilized containment chamber and SCP-217 was administered via aerosol. Once the SCP-610 infected subject was exposed to a sample of SCP-217, the subject entered a state of extreme distress. SCP-217&#39;s conversion of biological tissue occurred at a massively accelerated rate, with large portions of the subject&#39;s lower abdomen having been completely converted within fifteen minutes of infection. The subject ceaselessly screamed in apparent pain and began clawing at the portions of its body that had been converted, attempting to tear off the metal. Large tumorous growths began to appear under the organic metal, as if pushing it away from the rest of the body, but SCP-217 continued to convert the tissue. This continued for over two hours before the subject&#39;s body violently ruptured, terminating the subject and repelling the organic metal away from the body. Post-analysis of the corpse found no traces of either SCP-610 or SCP-217. The organic metal had autonomously reconstructed itself into a dimensionally perfect cube and no longer became a vector for the spread of SCP-217. Occasionally, sounds resembling growls and gargling can be heard inside the cube. Repeated tests unanimously resulted in similar results.  Following O5 approval, SCP-217 was unleashed upon the SCP-610 quarantine zone and protocols were instituted to ensure complete isolation.

||[[[SCP-2006]]] - Phobos, Greek God of Fear and Panic. Son of [[[SCP-4453|Ares the God of War]]] and twin brother of Deimos. True form is that of an anomalous spherical entity roughly 50 centimeters in diameter. Completely impervious to any kind of physical damage and possesses limitless shapeshifting abilities. SCP-2006&#39;s stated goal is to cause feelings of fear and/or horror in as many humans as possible. To accomplish this purpose, SCP-2006 possesses the ability to change its shape, mass, volume, density, chemical structure, and voice to any form that it desires. SCP-2006 has a poor understanding of human fear and thus is ineffective at scaring people.||[[[SCP-4606]]] - Deimos, Greek God of Dread and Terror.  Son of [[[SCP-4453|Ares the God of War]]] and twin brother of Phobos. True form unknown. SCP-4606 is a Class-IX Reality Altering Polymorphic Humanoid entity. It is capable of creating pocket dimensions where it can torment individuals by manifesting their worst fears. Physical damage inflicted by SCP-4606 will revert upon leaving his pocket dimensions. SCP-4606 has a perfect understanding of human fear.||SCP-2006 was reunited with his twin brother SCP-4606. Upon reunion, SCP-4606 opened an entryway into his pocket dimension and invited SCP-2006 inside. Three hours later, SCP-2006 and SCP-4606 emerged from the wormhole. SCP-2006 has expressed great joy due to a combination of remembering his identity as God of Fear, being with his brother again, and now having a better understanding of fear itself. SCP-4606 now works with SCP-2006 to aid The Foundation by using SCP-2006 to inflict lasting physical damage to hostiles and permanent containment of anomalies. {{-Professor Mint}}||
||[[[SCP-7034]]] - An extradimensional space of indeterminate length, containing nothing but a interstate highway, composed of eight lanes and guard-rails and high concentrations of traffic and pollution. Means of accessing the space are unclear as only the logs of Senior Researcher Richard Battaglia has provided insight into SCP-7034&#39;s nature.||[[[SCP-5322]]] - An extradimensional space of indeterminate length, accessible from a road named &#39;Route 108&#39; in Hackett, Georgia. The space consists of a single road, with the surrounding landscape varying, although mostly consists of fields and woodland.|| **[RECORDING START]** _

||[[[SCP-3790]]] - A seven-decker building, used by a non-existent branch of the Foundation in order to contain a variety of anomalous objects.||[[[SCP-7790]]] - A mangled automaton that, at random times, will begin manifesting a variety of unrelated objects and broadcasting a plethora of transmissions.||SCP-7790 is introduced onto the fourth room of SCP-3790&#39;s second level. Following this, SCP-7790 vanishes and the hallway lights up, revealing an auditorium at the end of the hallway. SCP-7790 is seen standing on the stage. The seats are full of rubbish and broken objects. {{- A. Lacroix}}||
||[[[SCP-7999]]] - A wormhole (7999-1) connecting the solar systems with a galaxy within the Ursa Major constellation. A planet (7999-2) within the local system is inhabited by an intelligent, Type II species of hexapedal arthropods (7999-3) known as &#34;Keradids&#34;, who are responsible for SCP-7999-1&#39;s creation. Due to an unknown issue, SCP-7999-3 are facing extinction.||[[[SCP-6999]]] - A Foundation-made, cognitohazardous performance of //Nearer, My God, to Thee//. When heard, SCP-6999 will trigger the fight-or-flight responses, resulting in a more cooperative and serene state of mind. SCP-6999 is to be activated and released globally prior to an imminent XK End-of-the-World scenario. ||Prior to the collapse of SCP-7999-1, SCP-6999 was transmitted to SCP-7999-2. Before SCP-7999-1 neutralized, a transmission from SCP-7999-2 was received: _

It is connected to numerous anomalous phenomena that affected the entire population of the town in June 1976.||[[[SCP-2740|]]] - A hypothetical anomaly that might exist in the northwest corner of the attic in the home of the Lee family at ████ █. ██ St, █████, Indiana. Any attempts to access the attic are later revealed to have never occurred.||//Releasing that which was kept inside, _

||[[[SCP-3069]]] -A massive physical construct extending approximately 6000 kilometers across the North Atlantic Ocean which continually releases specimens and substances of unknown origin. The purpose of this appears to be environmental disruption which will culminate with the implementation of accelerated artificial evolutionary advancement of most if not all of Earth&#39;s species.  ||[[[SCP-6002|SCP-6002-B]]] - An anomalous genetic infection that is highly resistant to all attempts to neutralize it. Genomes affected quickly degrade until they are extinct. It is estimated to reach the Homo sapiens genome no later than 2100.||Branches corresponding to the genomes of SCP-3069 specimens were located on SCP-6002. Foundation geneticists and arborists worked to gradually guide SCP-6002-B to these branches. Upon infection, the corresponding SCP-3069 specimens quickly went extinct. In response, SCP-3069 has relegated all of its resources to the production of new genomes which are summarily infected by SCP-6002-B. The rapid and continous creation and extinction of new genomes has prevented SCP-6002-B from spreading further across SCP-6002. {{- Dr. Zero}}||
