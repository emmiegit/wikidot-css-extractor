++++ NOTE

This is meant to be used as a resource, not as a &#39;canonical&#39; list of all of the fronts the Foundation uses. Please do not pester authors for &#39;using them wrong&#39; or anything of the sort.

[[div class=&#34;darkbox&#34;]]

The Foundation has worn several disguises in order to protect itself from the public eye. From construction firms to pharmaceutical companies to universities, there is no front organization too big or too small for the Foundation to conceal itself behind in the name of its mission of containment. Some are used once and then disposed of, some have multiple use cases and are resurrected as needed, and others have been in continuous use for over a century.

Several of these fronts have a further layer of protection in the form of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/pickman-blank-proposal The Frontispiece], a memetic aegis which prevents most people from linking the SCP Acronym back to the Foundation, but this isn&#39;t always the case.

In general, Fronts fall into a few different categories:
* **Academic/Educational:** Think-tanks, schools, universities, or collections of academics.
* **Agricultural:** Front organization operates as a farm or food manufacturer.
* **Commercial:** Businesses that do not involve manufacturing materials.
* **Custodial:** Cleaning services, both euphemistically and otherwise.
* **Entertainment:** Film studios, website curation, content creation.
* **Food Service:** The front also serves as a restaurant.
* **Industrial:** The front is a manufacturing, construction, or utility company.
* **Medical/Pharmaceutical:** The front is a medical facility such as a hospital, or a pharma research company.
* **Military/Security:** The front is a security force or military contractor. This includes aviation and space contractors.
* **Philanthropic:** The front is concealed behind an organization such as a charity or relief organization.
* **Real Estate:** The front is a real estate company, or owns several pieces of it.
* **Retail:** Front is a retail store.
* **Unclear:** The nature of the front isn&#39;t 100% obvious in the documentation.

++ How to contribute
-----
Consider which of the categories the front you wish to add to this list belongs to. 

Does it use the initials S.C.P. anywhere in its name? Then it goes in the __**Frontispiece**__ section. If not, __**Non-Frontispiece**__ is where it goes.

Is it an Academic front, a Military/Security front, etc.? Please put it in the appropriate sub-category, or in the &#34;Unclear&#34; section if you&#39;re not sure how to categorize it.

These lists operate in alphabetical order. Please make sure to put the front you found in the correct position on the list.

Please add entries using this template:
