**Item #:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1256 SCP-1256]-J

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Mobile Task Force Mambo-5 (//&#34;Honeymooners&#34;//) is currently assigned to the tracking and recovery of SCP-1256-J instances. All exposed subjects are to be administered antimemory juice, then coated in honey, rolled in a mixture of pollen and bee ketamine,[[footnote]] It&#39;s just regular ketamine but //very// finely ground.[[/footnote]] dressed in a flower costume and buried waist-down in an open field. This process has no relevance to containment success of SCP-1256-J, we just thought it would boost morale.[[footnote]] hehehue, they&#39;re all //amne-sticky//! Lookin&#39; like a forget-me-not if you know what I mean! Nice. Morale boost is a success[n=1].[[/footnote]]

**Description:** SCP-1256-J is a 420-page pamphlet entitled &#39;//Bees - Dumb as Fuck, Much More So Than You Could Possibly Imagine//&#39;. Contents reveal a passionate manifesto on how bees suck at pretty much every facet of their existence, as well as with all the relationship/occupational roles one can have as a human. It appears intended to be informational in nature; however, most of it is nonsensical. The cover of the pamphlet claims it is written by a P. Honeyname, however, no records of such name exis—//ohh//, I get it. Never mind.

When SCP-1256-J is read cover-to-cover, readers (Now designated SCP-1256-J-1) will perceive all members of the superfamily //Apoidea// as sapient and highly annoying/needy. Contrary to its title, SCP-1256&#39;s effect applies to all members of //Apoidea// including wasps, and also a few unrelated insects like ladybugs and cicadas, although the reason for this is not known. SCP-1256-J-1 instances insist insects invasively invade insides, insufficient investigations in intelligence institution into innards, instead interrupting insanity; inserted interesting interim illiter—alliteration. Damn it. //Sigh//.

Excerpts from SCP-1256-J:


&gt; **Bees - Dumb as Fuck, Much More So Than You Could Possibly Imagine**
&gt; 
&gt; I bet you think bees are just bees. Don&#39;t you? Well?? Ha!—I knew it. 
&gt; 
&gt; Guess what? You&#39;re wrong. Bees are not even bees, not at all are they bees. Zero bees are bees, and not by a longshot.
&gt; 
&gt; You poor, //ignorant fool//. 
&gt; 
&gt; How I wish I could push it all out of my mind—the constant buzzing,[[footnote]]Stress-induced tinnitus, unrelated to bee sounds.[[/footnote]] their incessant wittle wingflaps, their fuzzy buzzybutts. I yearn for death—A quiet, beeless death. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **COPING WITH THE EXISTENCE OF BEES**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; * **With bees, one must bee cautious:** Never let your guard down around a bee or talk to that goddamn scoundrel ever again, or the other one—the round one—or you&#39;ll regret it; they end up lodged in places they normally can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t fit.[[footnote]]Not sexual, they just like being close to you and warm, but they&#39;re not emotionally available either so it leaves something to bee desired regardless.[[/footnote]] Either way, it&#39;s not very fun when you have to explain to your urologist why and how bees keep ending up in the same spots.[[footnote]] &#34;I don&#39;t know! they just like hanging out in my ureth—**{{//,,bz,,^^zz^^zz...//}}//**—wait, what&#39;s that sound?//—who left that window open????—//oh no//—NOT AGAIN!—AGHHHH!!!&#34; [[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; * **With bees, this you can bee sure:** They dumb as bricks. They fly around and run into shit, they haven&#39;t had a decent job and barely pay taxes. They have shit taste in movies[[footnote]]//&#34;You like Jazzzz?&#34;//—my God, as if I didn&#39;t hate Jerry Seinfeld enough already. I think //Bee Movie// is like their //Citizen Kane// or something.[[/footnote]] and have you seen bee art? It&#39;s literally just flowers. Disgusting. We get it, you&#39;re really into &#34;pollinating&#34;. Gross.
&gt; 
&gt; * **Embrace bees as a subordinate, inferior species:** Bees are nature&#39;s cruel joke to bees. They don&#39;t have rights and barely have the capacity to do anything else other than work for practically nothing, harass others, and then die.[[footnote]] Humans are better than that, right? ....Right? [[/footnote]] They have like 2 HP and when they use their one attack, they die from it. Worst design ever. 
&gt; 
&gt; = IS BEE PROOF THERE IS NO GOD??
&gt; 
&gt; * **If bees bee botherin&#39; thee:** Bees can be annoying sometime, in your face, //bzzzz bzzzz//! Have you tried to push bee (for peace)?[[footnote]] Just nudge, then two nudge. If bee need three nudge, then it&#39;s probably yellow rock or perhaps a baby person? Sometimes it IS baby.//^^[citation needed]^^//[[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; * **Do not expose bees to political extremism:** Bees lack the nuanced geopolitical understanding of the current and historical political climate necessary to participate in government or pundit-style content-creation. You may find it difficult to get a bee candidate elected in any form of government as they have no proof of citizenship, zero experience (professional, personal or otherwise, I think they live for like four to eight weeks), plus they&#39;re impressionable and already kinda narrow-minded as it is, so I&#39;d just steer away from politics in general. 

&gt; = **FOLLOW OUR STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO HAVE AS LITTLE INTERACTION WITH THE BEES AS POSSIBLE.**
&gt; 1. bee approaches you
&gt; 2. pepspray/taser bee
&gt; 3. repeat this way until bee gone
&gt; ✔️ bee avoided

__Document 1256-J-Bee-Bee:__

Document (audio transcript) held as evidence in **//{{The Case of ███████ █████ v. APPROX. 2,000,000,000,000 bees, some cicadas and ladybugs}}//**, aka the Great Trial of Bees, an unprecedented legal exchange for which the Bees had apparently been well prepared. Document later confiscated by Foundation operatives.

&gt; [BEEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; █████ (quietly):  I have successfully avoided the bees, but their bee thoughts, the thoughts grow louder—they&#39;re close. 
&gt; 
&gt; ,,b e e s (muffled through wall): ayy where you at, been thinkin bout your nostrils. I can hear you breathin&#39; through &#39;em now, we know u home.,,
&gt; 
&gt; █████ (quietly): god damn, they&#39;re so fricking lame. (shouting) STAY AWAY FROM MY HOUSE!
&gt; 
&gt; ,,the bees (louder, in unison):  LET US IN. WE WANT TO GO UP UR BUTT N&#39; STUFF, IT&#39;S CHILLY OUT HERE,,
&gt; 
&gt; █████: nuh-uh, I&#39;m getting //the corks// again. 
&gt; 
&gt; ,,bees: [breaks down front door]—//BUZZ BUZZ MOTHERFUCKER!//,,
&gt;  
&gt; █████: [shrieks]
&gt; 
&gt; [big thud][[footnote]]Was actually a bunch of small thuds at once.[[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; █████: oh. They mistook my reflection for me and ran straight into the mirror. They&#39;re all dead. Morons. Whew—Okay. Good. Glad I didn&#39;t have to use the corks—
&gt; 
&gt; ,,cicadas (all directions, deafeningly loud): **Y&#39;ALL GOT ROOM FOR A FEW MORE???**,,
&gt; 
&gt; █████: —Fuck.
