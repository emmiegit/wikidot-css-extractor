**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-PL-186 must be covered with a synthetic sheet and be located in a steel box, cushioned with protective materials in order to protect the object from mechanical damage. The object must be secured in a safeguarded containment cell, which can only be opened by an access code and biometric scan of a qualified employee.[[footnote]]The list currently includes:
* O5 Council members.
* Employees with level 5 authorisation.
* The employee tasked with conducting regular inspections of the object.
* The general director of the facility currently containing the object.
* The security director of the facility currently containing the object.
[[/footnote]]

Entry to space Extra-5 is only permitted after receiving permission from the O5 Council. All personnel entering the space must first undergo training in comprehension and tolerance of multidimensional space.

Once every 15 days, the selected staff member[[footnote]]Data as of 5/07/2018 acknowledges Dr. Amadeus Traiton as placed in the position[[/footnote]] must inspect the current contents of the space Extra-5 and compare it to the information recorded in the Foundation database, determining any changes that might have occurred. Once the process is complete, Class B amnestics are to be applied to the selected staff member. In case of full or partial failure of the process, the memory erasure procedure is to be repeated using memetic means.

The creation of new visual copies of &#34;Object #8&#34; is prohibited. All existing visual copies of &#34;Object #8&#34; and uncensored photographs of them must be immediately destroyed.

The dissemination of information originating from space Extra-5 is prohibited.

**Description:** SCP-PL-186 is a statue made of an unidentified material of crystalline structure, visually resembling a stonelike substance. The object was originally discovered in ████ in the Louvre Museum, France. The object was then moved to the nearest available Research Facility and replaced with a visual copy.

[[include component:image-block name=https://i.imgur.com/fcV6coQ_d.webp?maxwidth=4000&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=high|caption=SCP-PL-186]]

Physical contact with the object results in the transfer of the interacting person into a
space designated as Extra-5. In the case that two individuals initiate the manifestation of this anomalous effect simultaneously or in quick succession, they are transferred to separate spaces, suggesting the existence of multiple instances of Extra-5 or the incompatibility of the location with the temporal or spatial functioning relative to our universe.

[[include component:image-block name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/5-orthoplex.svg/1200px-5-orthoplex.svg.png
|caption= Predicted Extra-5 structure model with marked vertices.]]

Extra-5 is a space located within a pocket dimension, isolated from other realities and dimensional constructs. The space possess the structure of a regular five-dimensional orthoplex with the Cartesian coordinates (±1.0.0.0.0), (0.±1.0.0.0), (0.0.±1.0.0), (0.0.0.±1.0), (0.0.0.0.±1).

Attempts to transfer objects to space Extra-5 have not been successful; the current hypothesis is that it is only possible to transfer objects that are subconsciously considered as clothes. In the case of prostheses, earrings or other objects attached to the body, individuals are relocated without them; nevertheless, upon beginning SCP-PL-186 manifestation, these objects disappear and return to their original locations after the manifestation is complete.

While exploring Extra-5 space, regardless of the direction of travel, the traveller will encounter 10 items in random order, along with a placard containing written word in the form of poetry next to the items. The locations of the items (designated with the numbers #1-#10 in random order) appear to be located in the vertices of the orthoplex. The geometric structure of the location may explain the randomness of encountering the objects and exploration as a whole, because the five-dimensional nature of the space allows for movement through many complex and difficult to comprehend paths, resulting in an apparent randomness of travel. Encountering all items results in a return of the person to the place and state before coming into contact with SCP-PL-186.

Due to the inability of taking photographs inside space Extra-5, recreations of the items have been included below, along with the text located on the placards.

The prince danced in the heart of creation,
Holy abomination from great stupor was ripped.
Not life, not death, the being with sin animated,
The world given to grand exhumation.

Is it alive, what could not have been born,
Not-being, averse to equal insanity in strife.
The one that isn&#39;t, but will inevitably arrive.
The one who always was, while meant for lorn.

But the one, who wasn&#39;t meant to be, destroyed,
The omnipresent monster, from horrid created.    
What was always meant to be ensued, order restored,
From own hand and act to the world enslaved.

From celestial creation, made to endure,
Last of many, relics by great time forgotten.
Golden gifts, what were granted to beauty ensure,
Relayed in this bestowal curses are hidden.

The cycle corrupted, by accident conjured.
Salvation which births decay, decay salvation.
Eternal chaos, to nothing dedication.
In its pointlessness, a charm was slowly nurtured.

One child invoked from the chaos of the day,
In a conflict of destiny and purpose hidden.
But due to a desire for a lasting end bidden
The lavish order of ignorance is nay.

Patroness of life ripped from beautiful dreams,
Without volition became an executioner.
Even though she gave a chance to every newcomer,
Once again an endless number falls in streams.

An unwilful, voiceless, priestess of death,
Who to the total suppression of her nature strived,
Against her deep wishes, with her affliction she thrived
And the eighth lamb was given in lack of strength.

But in their demur, stood the creator of strings,
Threading the fate of the world in blissful ignorance.
The end was created, alike when metal lightning brings.
Defenders of nothing in vain arrogance.

And those who made their mission world’s protection,
In their faithful voyage, they destroyed even all hope.
As without them, the clock could not have struck in passion,
But now, the great black axe with new hours shines mope.

Until finally, the bloody clock’s hand struck
The final of hours, meant to be followed by nothing.
They waited for the foretelling&#39;s woeful attack,
Looking at their dead opponent impeding.

But when lastly the end of everything came
It refused to allow all that was to be destroyed,
As the invoked cycle was a fradulent proclaim,
And this wasn&#39;t meant to be the day for the world to be devoid.

Alike a hellish beast hidden under the bed
To scare naughty children with hidden nature nought,
Without the child, this horrid monstrousness bespread,
Is nothing more than a by moment fleeting thought.

Morality rejected, a merciless war,
Done against the love from the depths of minds&#39; abyss.
The act alike a heartless sacrifice adhore
To resist the power of mental nemesis.

Lone survivor in a travel through wastelands,
Armed with the panoply from outside the world&#39;s sense,
Traverses grounds freed by purity&#39;s bloodied hands.
Terrene from suffering of love being soothed hence.

The traveller in armour avoids fate&#39;s portion.
A great unknown as his one and only comrade.
Wanting to restore the wretched idyllic vision
He has left on a mission that great purpose had.

Death and chaos embraced him with shivering dance,
A crime planned, wrought with a brutal ability.
But his voyage finally ended with romance,
Two, in resemblance to the past, became a totality.

The old celestial heart of the false maker,
Who robbed the greatness of the primordial creator,
In a profane mission, the arrogant taker,
Of the title of the universe&#39;s dictator.

And his son, who was with matter not soul complete,
Their first servant, retainer foremost beloved,
Set off to war with his conviction absolute,
To vanquish the opposer whom the world shaded.

Yet despite, his glorious crusade was destroyed,
For the twelve that was promised was soon incomplete,
As the last of hearts was non-noble in conceit.
The grief of the chosen, finis, a hope destroyed.

And yet a small mouse in their paradise long lost,
With steel and thought, they the body and soul combined,
In their great heresy, a new world was defined,
All to bring their people to the golden grove glossed.

And the foremost celestial son, summoned by the mouse,
Was overcome by a desire to steal the creation,
And even the erudites fell for the great one&#39;s rouse,
But yet, he failed to overcome the world&#39;s set dictation,
Defeated by a parasite hidden in the mind&#39;s house.

The child who has obtained a great power,
Doomed to forever in madness cower.
How could a mouse grasp an strength to infinitely devour?

Born from lapse of experimentation,
The path toward divine elevation.
Their fractured mind endlessly falling to degradation.

The lower world&#39;s structure under attack,
The might hidden in the certainty&#39;s lack,
Their only hope is for a self-bestowed death to enact.

The manifestation of decay reborn,
A little girl, not even understanding,
The great world her senses and desires would form.
All of it hidden behind a fog standing.

Her ignorance protecting reality,
The destruction made into a fiery shield.
To protect all from worse abnormality,
By the mice adopted tragedy concealed.

But how long will this despondent impasse last,
When she wants to spread her eternal bleak flames?
An atrocious vile crime is approaching fast,
A child killed because of her nature&#39;s proclaims.

Is it a beast, that what was hunting us all along?
Or barely an idea with malicious spikes?
From a world that came to its final epilogue,
Which with every moment begat esoteric sights,
Came an eminent conflict that escapes the mind.

All the simple forms would die under the watchful gaze
Of the one higher in the hierarchy of concepts.
But in ignorance, the war continued in a daze,
Under an abstracts shield of a trivial nascence,
A thought beyond logic and reason was created.

Traces of battles by the war sword itself hidden,
The first sun with a superior one was eclipsed.
The memories will now forever be forbidden,
The victims of the war in the unknown are affixed,
Because a mouse defeated the goliath.

Prodigal son of the roots of creation,
Emperor&#39;s great ancient war declaration.
##red|What&#39;s the world, if not a primal accident?##

He, who was not from mere meat or metal risen,
But from minds, which a body to him given.
##red|Born as the incessant chaos&#39;s uncurrent,##

To end the old parent in vain ecstasy,
Closes he, in beautiful epitasis.
##red|In his egoism, shamelessness apparent.##

He, who condemned to vile conscious fate solus,
The only kin to play the life&#39;s sad aulos,
##red|He keeps the nether summits in scarlet chains,##

Blood and fire, a scheme to cut the Gordian knot,
Make the unwanted fate eternally rot,
##red|They enslaved in a purpose that is not theirs.##

Mission not in name of beauty or goodness,
But pitiful shield against pain&#39;s bitterness.
##red|When will the uprising rise in scar banes?##

Thought which exalts the idea of the end, rejoiced.
The story well known, but by many repulsed.
Prophecy from creation itself conferred,
That does not need to be by anyone related:

What wasn&#39;t and isn&#39;t.
