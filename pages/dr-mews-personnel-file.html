++ __**Researcher Oliver Crane**__

**Name:** Researcher Oliver Crane

**Clearance Level:** Level 4

**Specialties:** Anomalous technology specialist, technological expert, visually triggered cognitohazards, vocal exploration leader

**Location:** Primarily Site 288, Site 23, occasionally other sites when needed.

**History:** Researcher Crane was born completely blind, which was proven useful in research of visually activated cognitohazards. Before joining the Foundation, Researcher Crane had a job as a Computer &amp; Information Research Scientist. He excelled at the job, knowing far more about coding and software engineering then required. Researcher Crane developed his own touch to hear technology in the form of a glove and Bluetooth earpiece to aid him around daily life.

Researcher Crane grew up in Airdrie, Scotland. He lacked an ideal upbringing, undergoing severe emotional and physical abuse by his father daily. The trauma of his past affects him to this day, as he developed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Dissociative Identity Disorder.. Researcher Crane has biweekly therapy sessions with Dr. Johnson.

Researcher Crane is often accompanied by Dr. Stanley Diamond when off-site, due to the two‚Äôs friendship.

&gt; **Author Notes:**
&gt; 
&gt; There are a multitude of phrases, items, and a few places which are triggering to him. Most cause from minor anxiety to panic attacks and occasionally flashbacks upon mention or contact, although a few items such as ropes, belts, and metal forks and knives, and insults about his blindness almost always send him into flashbacks, as those things were all very prominent in his childhood trauma.
&gt; 
&gt; Dislikes when people look at his blindness as a disability
&gt; 
&gt; Seen as &#34;the nice one&#34; by many, but typically only keeps to himself to avoid argument. Will stand up for himself if he feels he‚Äôs being disrespected.
&gt; 
&gt; Crane often dissociates, which is the reason some of his spoken dialogue often has ‚Äústutters‚Äù in it. He‚Äôs pretty much dissociating at least 35-45% of a day, but is so used to it, he powers through.
&gt; 
&gt; Crane has very bad trust issues, as he was abused by his father, and his mother didn‚Äôt care, even lying for him if suspicions were raised.
&gt; 
&gt; Crane and Diamond are dating
&gt; 
&gt; You can find him in:

++ __**Dr. Stanley Diamond**__

**Name:** Dr. Stanley Diamond

**Clearance Level:** Level 3

**Occupation:** Geologist

**Specialties:** Archeological anomalies, geological anomalies

**Location:** Site 288, Site 23, wherever needed

**History:** Dr. Diamond was the head researcher of SCP-‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà, and involved in Incident SCP-‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà. In result of the incident, Dr. Diamond received a facial wound.

Dr. Diamond‚Äôs mother was murdered by his uncle when he was five years old. Although he dislikes the details, the exact situation was traumatic, ever changing how he viewed the world, and the people in it.

**Profile:** Dr. Diamond has been described by others as ‚Äúa selfish asshole‚Äù around anyone who is not Researcher Oliver Crane. Dr. Diamond has developed a somewhat protective nature for Researcher Crane, accompanying him on offsite missions, as well as emotionally stressing ones.

&gt; **Author‚Äôs Notes:**
&gt; 
&gt; Diamond has PTSD and Borderline Personality Disorder, but has refuted the diagnoses, despite being diagnosed twice by two different doctors. He believes these diagnoses make him weak, but doesn‚Äôt think Crane‚Äôs CPTSD diagnosis makes him weak, revealing a double standard he‚Äôs sort of been raised to have.
&gt; 
&gt; After his mother was murdered, his father completely ignored her, and would get upset at Diamond for crying and mourning his mother‚Äôs death. His father wanted him to be strong and ‚Äúmanly‚Äù as he grew up, and wasn‚Äôt afraid to use physical punishment to get Diamond to obey him. His father was never the nicest man, and didn‚Äôt become nicer after the death of Delilah Diamond.

++ __**Dr. Juniper Marigold**__

**Name:** Dr. Juniper ‚ÄúMarigold‚Äù Daisy

**Clearance Level:** Level 4

**Profession:** Microbiology researcher, sapient anomalies specialist

**Location:** Site 23, Site 43

**Profile:** Dr. Marigold communicates somewhat stoically, keeping a monotone voice, an expressionless face. Despite this, her individuality still shines through in her mannerisms such as: sitting on the floor opposed to a chair as much as possible, constantly moving one of her limbs (eg: leg, arm, hand, or rocking back and forth), being incredibly blunt, not realizing when things she says are out of place, and extreme love of animals with more than four limbs (which shows). Dr. Marigold enjoys watching the fish tank in her office, reading books, judging other people‚Äôs decisions, and interacting with safe class anomalies.

**History:** Dr. Marigold has been working for the Foundation every since she received her master&#39;s degree in microbiology. She became aware and interested in the position due to her mother‚Äôs job as a Foundation researcher.

After two years of working with her mother, incident ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà-‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà occurred, ending in her mother‚Äôs termination. Although Dr. Marigold was not involved, she still felt it was her job to take her mother‚Äôs place. She took up working with sapient anomalies and is now where she is today.

&gt; **Author Notes:**
&gt; 
&gt; Autistic
&gt; 
&gt; Followed her mother to work one day as a child and the amnestics didn&#39;t take full affect, revealing her resistance to amnestics; her resistance to memetics and cognitohazards was later discovered
&gt; 
&gt; Has two crabs named Leopold and Buttercream that were discovered in a pet store

**Specialties:** Personnel recovery following interactions with emotionally stressing anomalies

**Location:** Site 23, Site 288

**Profile:** Dr. Hart is a man who prefers to keep to himself. He doesn‚Äôt often express his emotions and has only [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4412 | one]]] close friend. Despite this, his work as a psychologist has remained unaffected.

Dr. Hart has a past with getting into physical fights, and winning by a landslide. It&#39;s not a part of himself he prefers to share.

&gt; **Author Notes:**
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Hart and Researcher Gates are dating, but have not and do not plan to inform the Foundation of this.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Hart is //incredibly// easy to anger, especially if Researcher Gates is insulted around him. He‚Äôs been working on it, but he has a bit of a lack on impulse control.
&gt; 
&gt; Has intermittent explosive disorder and depression
&gt; 
&gt; Grew up in and out of juvenile detention and mental hospitals due to extreme anger issues
&gt; 
&gt; Has a dislike for &#34;authority&#34; but doesn&#39;t openly show this
&gt; 
&gt; Doesn&#39;t like using his full name &#34;Kenneth&#34; and prefers the nickname Kenny

**Clearance Level:** Level 2

**Occupation:** Semi-retired Mechanical Engineer

**Profile:** After his interaction with [[[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4412 | SCP-4412]]], Researcher Gates has not worked with many anomalies due to decline in mental health.

&gt; **Author‚Äôs Notes:**
&gt; 
&gt; Has Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and is a recovering alcoholic.
&gt; 
&gt; Killed his sister in a car crash via manslaughter while drunk, had the choice of jail or the foundation as he worked for the government, and the foundation already had their eye out for him, read [[[SCP-4412]]] for details it‚Äôs all explained there
