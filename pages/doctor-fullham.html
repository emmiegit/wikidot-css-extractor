[[/=]]
&gt; This was my first ever SCP, and it took me ages to write. The earliest drafts were a sad ripoff of [[[SCP-093 | SCP-093]]] and people were quick to tell me such. After two years of editing and polishing, it was finally to a point where I felt comfortable posting it in the fall of 2018. 
&gt; 
&gt; As of 21/06/2020, I have done a fairly major rewrite and shaved off about 1500 words thanks to the lovely [[*user cybersqyd]]. Ve helped me trim the fat and cut out a lot of stuff that didn&#39;t really help the narrative, and for that ve has my eternal gratitude. [[*user MalyceGraves]]&#39;s advice also prompted me to remove every single blackbox on the page. 
&gt; 
&gt; Fun fact: The original title was &#34;The Living Dimension&#34;, which I changed to &#34;Knock Knock Knockin&#39; on Fear&#39;s Door&#34; after the rewrites in 2020. Then, [[*user WarFang]] on IRC gave me the current, much better title.
