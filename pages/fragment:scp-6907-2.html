    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Item #:** SCP-6907

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** In the event SCP-6907-1 manifests again, it is to be brought to a regional containment site and await transfer to a more permanent residence based on psychological evaluations. A standard containment team is needed for this.

In the event SCP-6907-2 manifests again, all Foundation personnel are advised to vacate the immediate vicinity of the anomaly and evacuate civilians, if possible. Agents are to maintain surveillance and record details of SCP-6907&#39;s actions and log them until a sufficient thaumaturgical response can be devised in order to contain the anomaly. SCP-6907-2 is currently awaiting designation as a separate SCP object.

**Description:**  SCP-6907-1 is a Type White humanoid anomaly that appeared on 07/26/2014 in western Maryland. It bears the appearance of an adolescent human male and lacks notable anomalous abilities besides biological immortality and increased durability and endurance. It is currently theorized that SCP-6907-1 is unable to manifest in this plane of existence of its own ability (see addendum) and that any further anomalous traits it does have are similarly unrelated to its capabilities.

SCP-6907-2 is a Type White humanoid anomaly that appeared on 07/31/2014 inside of the temporary containment site constructed to contain SCP-6907-1. It bears the appearance of an adult human female, and possesses several anomalous abilities, including:

* Biological immortality .
* Dramatically increased durability and endurance.
* Dramatically increased physical capabilities.
* Creation of spatial rifts, theorized to be extradimensional.
* Psionic projection of force.
* Ability to summon a large entity consisting of bone and viscera, although it is unknown at this time if this is truly a distinct entity from SCP-6907-2 or a psionic projection.
* Ability to rapidly manipulate blood and fresh remains.

Unfortunately, due to the limited information the Foundation has regarding SCP-6907-2, several of these abilities are poorly understood, and the anomaly is expected to possess undocumented capabilities as well.

**Addendum 6907.1:** Recovery

[[collapsible hideLocation=&#34;both&#34; show=&#34;Access Recovery Log&#34; hide=&#34;Close Recovery Log&#34;]]

&gt; Everyone, listen up. I&#39;ll keep this short, but before the time comes, I have a few words I feel I need to say. In my time as the commander of this Joint Task Force, I have to say I have never seen a finer group of men and women. It fills me with pride that I was able to meet each of you, even though our time together was brief. 
&gt; 
&gt; In truth, I have no idea what&#39;s coming. I can offer little to you to prepare you more than what your training has already done. All I can say is that when the time comes, no matter what this so-called &#39;god&#39; says, thinks, or does, I can imagine no group of humans I would be more proud to show them than all of you. Godspeed, you beautiful bastards.
&gt; 
&gt; -Commander A. Keyes, commanding officer of Joint Task Force Sigma-8 &#34;Most Unlucky For You,&#34; 30 minutes before the manifestation of SCP-6907-1


[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Recovery Log for SCP-6907-1**
//Note: SCP-6907-1 appeared at 19:35:45 on 07/26/2014 near the stone obelisk, as was predicted based on the trajectory of the asteroids mentioned in the previous document. The following log begins shortly before this point.//
----
**Keyes:** Remember everyone, don&#39;t lose your nerve. Only fire on my command, or according to our previously discussed contingencies should I be incapacitated. Church will take the first shot at the thing with the railgun, then artillery will open up once a solid location is nailed down. Railgun emplacements and helicopters stand by.

//(Several seconds later, the space above the obelisk begins to distort. The distortions grow in strength until a humanoid, henceforth referred to as SCP-6907-1, exits, approximately 170cm in height and wearing garments that appear crystalline in composition. It stands on the ground where it appeared with its hands clasped behind its back and spends several seconds surveying the fortifications of the Joint Task Force.)//

**SCP-6907-1:** Hmpf. What strange contraptions your kind has constructed since last I arrived in this plane. For your supposed intelligence, I see you all lacked the wisdom to heed the warnings I had so graciously sent to foretell my arrival. //(SCP-6907-1 closes its eyes and shakes its head)// I see the years have not cured your kind of their pride. Perhaps you have merely forgotten your place on the grand hierarchy. Well, allow me to reacquaint you. For I am Akendu-fel, Lord of the End, supplicant of Eresh-mla, Scion of Bloodshed... //(SCP-6907-1 begins walking forward)// ...and I shall usher this grand, bloated empire from this-

//(At this time, JTF Sharpshooter Church fires his MDR-5001, landing a direct headshot on the entity.)//

**SCP-6907-1:** Gwuh!

//(SCP-6907-1&#39;s head jerks back suddenly as it staggers backwards several steps, eventually tripping and falling onto its back. After numerous attempts to stand back up, it eventually manages to, holding its nose with both of its hands.)//

**SCP-6907-1:** Uh! Wha-uhhhh... Ow... //(Blood appears to be coming from the nose of the entity, trailing down its arms, and its voice is distorted as it holds its nose closed)// Ugh! My nobe! My nobe hurt! Ah! //(Its eyes widen as it notices the blood)// Wha? Huh? Why my nobe bleeding? //(SCP-6907-1 looks back at the JTF personnel in front of him)// Did... did you make a... new crozzbow?

//(At this time, seeing that the entity was not subdued, Commander Keyes signals for an artillery bombardment at its location. Several artillery batteries begin firing.)//

**SCP-6907-1:** Wha did you get that waz so loud- OH!

//(The shells from the artillery barrage impact SCP-6907-1&#39;s location, with a constant barrage maintained for thirty seconds, at which point Keyes calls for it to be paused. Several minutes pass, but spotters are unable to get a clear line of sight on SCP-6907-1 due to the dust cloud created by the artillery. A team of elite Foundation agents is sent to assess the situation, and if possible, recover the anomaly.)//

//(After cautiously approaching the location of the entity, checking for any signs of movement, they arrive at a large crater. Team leader Johnson notices some slight movement at the bottom of the crater, and signals his team to stay back. He approaches the edge of the crater, and slowly looks in. At the bottom is SCP-6907-1, awake and on its back, with a shocked facial expression.)//

**Johnson:** Alright! Give me a sign if you can hear me, got it!?

//(SCP-6907-1 slowly turns its head to look at Johnson. Without changing its facial expression, it groans weakly.)//

**Johnson:** Alright, we&#39;re coming down to you! Cooperate, or we will open fire again! Do you understand?!

//(SCP-6907-1 turns its head back towards the sky. It whimpers quietly and appears to be holding back tears. The team slowly approach the bottom of the crater.)//

**Johnson:** Jesus, uh, Jenkins, check this thing out. We&#39;ll cover you.

//(Jenkins, the team medic, approaches the SCP-6907-1 while the other team members keep their weapons pointed at the entity. Jenkins performs a series of basic checks for responsiveness and injury. SCP-6907-1&#39;s lip begins trembling.)//

**Jenkins:** Well, er, I think he&#39;s- it&#39;s fine. Responsive to stimuli and no, like, massive bone fractures.

**Johnson:** Alright. Listen up! Get up, and come with us, now! Any sudden movements or anomalous actions will be treated as hostile and dealt with as such! Understood?!

//(SCP-6907-1 slowly nods and begins silently crying. After several seconds, it manages to stand up with some effort and limps towards the team.)//

**Johnson:** Now, stay in front of us! Hands in the air, got it?! Move!

//(SCP-6907-1 holds its hands in the air and begins slowly walking out of the crater. As it nears the top of the crater, it slips on a patch of mud, falling directly onto its face and sliding back down to the bottom of the crater. It begins openly crying and punching the mud.)//

----

Following this, reinforcements and a medevac team was sent in and secured SCP-6907-1, bringing him to a temporary containment site. The entity was noted to be visibly upset but otherwise cooperative. 

//I could have contained the damn thing by myself with a strong voice and my belt.// -Commander Keyes

**Addendum 6907.2:** Intake interview

[[collapsible hideLocation=&#34;both&#34; show=&#34;Access ITRVW-6907-1.02 excerpt&#34; hide=&#34;Close ITRVW-6907-1.02 excerpt&#34;]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Interviewer:** Dr. Harry Erikson, Senior Foundation Psychologist
**Interviewee:** SCP-6907
Standard intake interview for sapient anomalies conducted 20 hours after completed recovery.
----

//(Dr. Erikson enters the containment cell. SCP-6907-1 is restrained to a chair, and appears disheveled and upset, although it has not made any escape attempts since it was secured.)//

**Dr. Erikson:** Hello. I am here to conduct a simple interview with you for our intake procedures. Is that alright?

**SCP-6907-1:**Ah, yes, that is fine. I see I have not debased myself so much that they would not send a proper dignitary to revoice me, at least.

**Dr. Erikson:** Excuse me?

**SCP-6907-1:** You move well for your advanced age. I can only assume your subjects attend to you quite well. Doubtless you&#39;ve had terrible illnesses in the past, based on your looks. 

**Dr. Erikson:** //(whispers)// Just four more years until pension...

**SCP-6907-1:** I&#39;m sorry, could you repeat that?

**Dr. Erikson:** It was nothing. Now, I am required to inform you that your answers here will impact how you will be contained moving forward, and that this is being recorded before we begin. 

**SCP-6907-1:** Aha, so you do have a scribe. Is he in the next room?

**Dr. Erikson:** //(pause)// Yes. Now, moving on to the interview, can you tell me the extent of your capabilities?

**SCP-6907-1:** Yes, of course. I was once a mortal such as yourself, but achieved a higher being upon my deification. You see, alongside my ascension, my mortal shell was granted divine powers to match such an illustrious state.

**Dr. Erikson:** I&#39;m sorry, your ascension?

**SCP-6907-1:** Indeed. All who ascend such as I are afforded unending life, imperviousness to harm from mortals, and a suite of other abilities.

**Dr. Erikson:** Alright, then, what other abilities do you have?

//(SCP-6907-1 only smiles weakly in response, although its eyes appear pained.)//

**Dr. Erikson:** Uh... I mean, you just have this... //amazing// invulnerability?

//(SCP-6907-1 places its head on the table.)//

**SCP-6907-1:** Yes, although I should have it stripped. What a disgrace I am, now. I have failed to fulfill my singular role. I&#39;ve failed everything. Eresh-Mla must hate me.

**Dr. Erikson:** I actually intended to ask you about that. You said you were a supplicant to this &#39;Eresh-mla&#39;? Who is that?

**SCP-6907-1:** She is my sis- //(SCP-6907-1 wraps its head in its arms)// No, I forfeit the right to call her that now... She was the one who lifted me up from my mortal shell, so graciously offering me a place at her side, and yet this is how I repay her.

**Dr. Erikson:** So this &#39;Eresh-mla,&#39; was she... essentially your boss?

**SCP-6907-1:** I was merely her supplicant, yet she was so gracious as to let me pretend to be her family. What a failure I am. I suspect she should kill me for this.

**Dr. Erikson:** Wait, uh, hey, back it up. You said your boss is coming to kill you? Do you need to be put into protective containment?

**SCP-6907-1:** //(sits up in its chair, but remains looking at the ground)// I would ask that you leave me to what may become of me, and besides, I fear that even with your progress, you may be powerless against Eresh-mla.

**Dr. Erikson:** Ah, yes, I saw the recovery log. You mean the weapons we used, I assume.

**SCP-6907-1:** In part, but technological advancement has always been something of a foregone conclusion. I was more astounded to find you supplement your forces with women.

**Dr. Erikson:** //(pause)// Huh?

**SCP-6907-1:** You see, in my previous visits to this world, I was considered to be a young and imposing warrior, yet now even the women look down on me. 

//(Note: SCP-6907-1 is roughly 175cm tall, appears to be an adolescent, and does not appear to be abnormally strong.)//

**Dr. Erikson:** Uh-huh... well, back on topic, do you think you&#39;re in danger?

**SCP-6907-1:** Alas, Eresh-mla has not come for me. I find it likely she simply deemed me unworthy of her time to deal with or pull back to our- //(SCP-6907-1 bites its lip)// her domain. After all, she graces me with her power each time I need to move between worlds, and yet in this one chance I have to repay her, I fail //miserably.//

**Dr. Erikson:** So this Eresh-mla is the reason you could come here in the first place?

//(SCP-6907-1 nods its head.)//

**Dr. Erikson:** Okay, without any input from other entities, what is it that you, alone, can do?

//(SCP-6907-1 lifts its head to make eye contact with Dr. Erikson. It looks like it may begin crying)//

**Dr. Erikson:** Um, okay, I think that&#39;s everything, actually. Do you need anything from me? Water or food?

**SCP-6907-1:** W-Water would be appreciated.

**Dr. Erikson:** Alright. //(Dr. Erikson hands SCP-6907-1 a plastic water bottle)//

**SCP-6907-1:** What... is this?

**Dr. Erikson:** Oh, yeah, I guess plastic is pretty new. It&#39;s just what we use for bottles now, it&#39;s more flimsy than glass but it&#39;s fine.

**SCP-6907-1:** I... see.

**Dr. Erikson:** Okay, I&#39;ll take my leave now. Have a good day.

**SCP-6907-1:** Likewise.

//(Dr. Erikson exits the room. SCP-6907-1 attempts to pull off the bottle&#39;s screw-on cap several times, becoming increasingly frustrated. It then begins squeezing the bottle, and after a couple minutes, the pressure causes the cap to come off of the bottle, hitting SCP-6907-1 in the face as well as covering him in the water, emptying the bottle of water in the process. SCP-6907-1 rests its head in its arms on the table and begins crying.)//

**Addendum 6907.3:** Breach log

[[collapsible hideLocation=&#34;both&#34; show=&#34;Access Breach Log&#34; hide=&#34;Close Breach Log&#34;]]


[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Containment Breach Log for SCP-6907-1**
//Note: On 07/31/2014, a new entity, henceforth referred to as SCP-6907-2, manifested outside of the temporary containment cell SCP-6907-1 was being held in. Security officers T. Watterson and J. Moore were guarding the door to the cell, with Agent Church across a small buffer zone armed with his MDR-5001 in case of a breach.//
----
**Watterson:** Hey, Moore.

**Moore:** Yeah?

**Watterson:** Why are we here?

**Moore:** Now, there&#39;s a question. I can see why you might be asking it after we contained this thing. It calls itself a god and all, but you know, what is it to tell us what&#39;s what? It might seem scary at first, but I like to think that simply by being alive, we give our lives meaning just by being here, even if there are some things that like to look down on us. Ultimately, I think we&#39;re here because we can be, and there doesn&#39;t need to be some divine decree to say so.

**Watterson:** ...What? No, I just mean in front of this door.

**Moore:** Oh. Oh yeah. That makes more sense. 

**Watterson:** This thing is pretty pathetic. It can&#39;t even break out of the restraints we put it in. Why do we need to be here when Church is watching the door anyways?

//(Watterson waves to Church from across the buffer room, and Church waves back.)//

**Moore:** It&#39;s standard procedure. Besides, they&#39;re trying to figure out what to do for containment. Type Whites are tricky, you know.

**Watterson:** Sure, but I mean, come the fuck on. You can probably contain the thing with the promise of ice cream, for the love of god. My niece would be a bigger issue. I&#39;ve been here for almost a week now, for Christ&#39;s sake.

**Moore:** I&#39;ll admit, this has all been... rather anticlimactic. 

**Watterson:** Shit, that&#39;s one way to put it. I mean, I just got called up to run security for this thing since I lived nearby. Imagine getting pulled out of Nu-7 to get ready for this, and instead of some real god of death like they were expecting, it&#39;s just some fuckup kid. 

**Moore:** That&#39;s sort of why we got called up, isn&#39;t it? So the task force guys could get back to actually working?

**Watterson:** I mean, I guess, but all we normally do is run security checkpoints for inanimate objects. Like, us even being here is already more security than most low-risk humanoids have, but what if shit really //does// hit the fan? It&#39;s not like we have training to deal with serious shit. The fact that we&#39;re even here instead of the task force guys means that command expects us to do nothing.

**Moore:** I guess it can seem pointless, but it&#39;s an easy paycheck, right? We should just be thankful we don&#39;t have to deal with something //actually// threatening.

//(At this time, a distortion similar to the one that preceded the manifestation of SCP-6907-1, appears in front of Watterson and Moore. It begins to emit a red liquid that flows upwards to the ceiling and pools there. After a few seconds, a length of red hair and red cloth begins to descend from the pool.)//

**Church:** Sunovabitch!

**Watterson:** If we both get out of this you&#39;re getting fucking pistol whipped.

//(What appears to be a humanoid female, referred to as SCP-6907-2, exits the pool in an inverted position, rotating to stand on the floor of the containment cell facing Watterson and Moore. The entity appears approximately 230cm in height and wears garments similar in composition to those worn by SCP-6907-1, though more ornate, featuring a number of attached cloth ornaments.)// 

//(SCP-6907-2 stands with its hands clasped behind its back. Watterson and Moore both look at SCP-6907-2 without saying or doing anything. After several seconds, the entity turns around and looks around the room.)//

**SCP-6907-2:** Ah, well... I suppose I should be the one making introductions here... //(clears throat)// Take heed, mortals. I am Eresh-Mla, Scion of Bloodshed.  I have come to this world for my brother, Akendu-fel.

//(Watterson remains motionless, but makes eye contact with Church and appears to mouth &#39;Help me. Help. Me.&#39; Church contacts regional command to inform them of the situation. Note that at this time, none of the personnel have clearance or instructions to move to contain SCP-6907-2. Standard procedure states to avoid angering the entity if possible in lieu of commands.)//

**SCP-6907-2:** //(Looks between Watterson and Moore several times)// My brother //is// here, is he not?

**Moore:** Wuh-uh, well, I don&#39;t, uh, think I&#39;m at liberty to say, but you- you absolutely are not allowed past this door.

**Watterson:** And you&#39;re trespassing.

**Moore:** Yeah, uh, yes, you are. And I will have to ask you to leave immediately.

**SCP-6907-2:** My appearance in this location was no coincidence. I know that he is behind this door.

**Watterson:** //(smiles)// No he&#39;s not.

**SCP-6907-2:** Your protests are irrelevant. I will be seeing him. 

**Moore:** We&#39;re both sorry and all, but it&#39;s our job to guard this door. We don&#39;t even have the keys if we //wanted// to go in. So, ah. You should probably just wait here.

//(At this point, Command makes a positive ID on SCP-6907-2, and contacts Moore, Watterson, and Church through their earpieces.)//

**Command:** Personnel, please be advised. Entity has been identified as POI-2957. Sending you a file on the entity now. Recommend immediately subduing it if possible. 

//(Watterson and Moore look at the file on their personal devices briefly, then stare at SCP-6907-2 without speaking. Church begins readying his MDR-5001.)//

**SCP-6907-2:** If a key is the only issue, I will simply pry the door open. If it is particularly costly, I suppose I could wait, but my work may demand I move somewhat hastily.

//(Watterson and Moore fail to respond. SCP-6907-2 appears confused by this, and after several seconds, waves its hand in front of Moore&#39;s face, causing Moore to yell.)//

**SCP-6907-2:** Ah, you appear frightened. I assure you, unless you seek to harm me, I mean you no harm-

//(As SCP-6907-2 is focused on Moore, Church fires at the entity, landing a direct hit in its back near where its heart would be. The projectile is deflected off of SCP-6907-2&#39;s armor, and it recoils from the blow slightly but does not lose its footing. It then returns to a fully upright posture and slowly turns to look at Church.)//

**SCP-6907-2:** Insolence.

//(SCP-6907-2 begins walking directly towards Church, making no visible effort to guard itself. Church fires again once the entity is within six feet of him, hitting the entity in its unarmored head. Its head appears to jerk back from the hit slightly, and leaves no visible wound. It then reaches out to grasp the firearm with its left hand, and crushes the magnetic coils and receiver, rendering the weapon inoperable.)//

**Church:** Sunovabitch!

**SCP-6907-2:** Such weapons are impressive. I find it to be no surprise you managed to subdue my brother, yet you appear to believe your might makes you immune from consequence. Why would you choose to provoke me in such a way? I have made an effort to appear amicable.

**Church:** Uh, well, ma&#39;am, I was just following orders, you know. I mean, your file did say you , ah, completely laid out a full STRIKE team, so Command wanted to be a bit more... proactive...?

**SCP-6907-2:** //(appears confused and slightly angered)// Impossible. I have not yet visited this world.

**Church:** I-I mean, they got you on video. Smashing a bigass mech suit with a goat-headed blood skeleton the size of a building.

//(SCP-6907-2 takes a step back and brings a hand to its chin, appearing to be less angered.)//

**SCP-6907-2:** Ah. Yes. Well, that does sound like me. 

//(Command elects to muster a new containment force based on the entity&#39;s resilience. Watterson, Moore, and Church are advised to continue monitoring SCP-6907-2 in the meantime. SCP-6907-2 begins walking back towards the containment cell.)//

**Watterson:** You know what, actually? Fuck this. I&#39;m not fucking dying for this door.

**Moore:** Ah, wait a second. //(Moore stands between SCP-6907-2 and the door to the containment cell)// Aren&#39;t you, gonna, like, kill the guy? It-it&#39;s sort of our whole job to keep him safe right now, so if you could just, er, //leave//, we can make sure he&#39;s as good as dead for you! Really, It&#39;ll save you some time.

**Watterson:** Are you fucking insane?

**SCP-6907-2:** //(stops in front of Moore and looks down at him)// I grow weary of this. 

//(A distortion manifests beneath Moore, and a red liquid falls from it and quickly pools on the ground. Before Moore notices it, he falls through the pool, appearing to exit a portal directly behind SCP-6907-2 and falling onto the floor.)//

**Moore:** Welp, that&#39;s everything I can do.

//(Watterson looks at Moore and the entity with his mouth slightly agape. SCP-6907-2 extends its right arm towards the door, and after a few seconds, an unseen force blasts the metal security door off its hinges.)//

**Church:** Sunovabitch!

**SCP-6907-2:** Will you cut- //(groans)// Akendu? Are you there?

//(SCP-6907-2 steps into the containment cell. SCP-6907-1 sits in its chair facing the table and the door, and appears to be shaking, with tears in its eyes. The door appears to have been blown into the room, narrowly missing SCP-6907-1 and impacting the wall behind it.)//

//(Church informs command that containment has been breached, but is informed that due to the Joint Task Force having disbanded, response time will be extended.)//

**SCP-6907-2:** Ah, there you are. //(clears throat)// I apologize for my late arrival, but my most fervent worshiper had once again taken to scouring the Umbral Plane, and I was unable to ignore such a tribute of bloodshed. Besides, I decided this was something I should handle personally, rather than send one of my retainers.

**SCP-6907-1:** Ah, of course... I was foolish to think you wouldn&#39;t come for me...

**SCP-6907-2:** //(pause)// Well, yes. If you had assumed I had simply abandoned you, you would be quite foolish.

**SCP-6907-1:** Yes, of course. //(closes its eyes and begins to weep, and clasps its hands together)// Oh, exalted, I understand the weight of my failures!

**SCP-6907-2:** Er... You see, it was not so-

**SCP-6907-1:** I know this request to be selfish, but I throw myself upon your mercy to ask that your judgment be passed upon me quickly!

**SCP-6907-2:** ...Pardon me?

**SCP-6907-1:** Oh, I have failed in my only task! A merciful death is too lenient! 

//(SCP-6907-2 begins approaching SCP-6907-1.)//

**SCP-6907-1:** An impotent supplicant! How pitiful! To be stricken down by one such as Eresh-mla is an honor! May my death serve as a-

//(SCP-6907-2 bends down and places its hands on SCP-6907-1&#39;s face)//

**SCP-6907-2:** Akendu. I do not have, nor will I ever have, any intention to harm you. Why would you ever believe otherwise?

//(Church receives orders from Command to maintain close surveillance on the entity until a response can be mustered, and approaches Moore and Watterson.)//

**Church:** You two. Command needs you to keep tabs on the entity.

**Watterson:** What the hell? Aren&#39;t you more qualified for that than us? Why the hell should we go up there?

**Church:** The 1% chance of pissing off that thing vs the 100% chance of my foot in your ass. Take your pick. I&#39;ve got to talk with command.

//(Moore and Watterson grumble indistinctly but approach the doorway to the containment cell.)//

**SCP-6907-1:** Wuh... uh... the Warden said impotent supplicants are-

**SCP-6907-2:** //(removes its hands from SCP-6907-1&#39;s face)// The Warden, ha! What does that corpulent fiend know of proper supplicants? Or family for that matter?

**SCP-6907-1:** So... my failure did //not// anger you? 

**SCP-6907-2:** No. In fact, I fear I may be somewhat culpable for this as well. You see, I had forgotten that this world had developed armaments in excess of what you were equipped to handle.

**SCP-6907-1:** B-But I should have been able to overcome //any// obstacle! This is why you had such faith in me, right, Eresh-mla?

//(SCP-6907-2 tilts its head to the side and smiles at SCP-6907-1.)//

**SCP-6907-1:** R-Right?

**SCP-6907-2:** //(clears throat)// You, there. Voyeur in the doorway.

//(Moore and Watterson, watching the proceedings from the doorway, both jump back slightly.)//

**SCP-6907-2:** Your guild has no doubt seen a fair few monstrosities, no? 

**Moore:** Well, yeah. That&#39;s why we were the ones to deal with your brother in the first place.

**SCP-6907-2:** I assumed as much. Now, how would you say my brother here compares?

//(SCP-6907-1 looks at Moore and Watterson.)// 

**Watterson:** The containment specialists are arguing over if he can spontaneously generate water because of how much he&#39;s been crying. Beyond that there&#39;s nothing notable I can think of.

//(SCP-6907-1 begins to cry, but appears to make an effort to stop.)//

**SCP-6907-1:** So... I never even had your faith?

**SCP-6907-2:** You are... looking at this from the wrong angle.

**SCP-6907-1:** And you are not denying this.

**Moore:** I mean, he did do what he was supposed to before, at least, right? Overcoming armies and all that?

**SCP-6907-2:** Fah. When he came to worlds in the past, he really just walked past all the warriors. He didn&#39;t even kill their leaders, he merely sent them away from this world and into the custody of the Warden, then returned to me.

**Moore:** Wait, then what happened to all those ancient civilizations he destroyed?

**SCP-6907-2:** Akendu only ever appeared before bloated, mismanaged empires. They mostly ran around like headless chickens for a few years, before lionizing his strength in messages to feel better about how they fell. 

**SCP-6907-1:** It was you who offered a partnership with the Warden!

**SCP-6907-2:** The Warden holds a great many things in his collections. I was just... hoping you would find something of interest.

**SCP-6907-1:** I... what?

**SCP-6907-2:** //(crouches to be at eye level with SCP-6907-1)// Akendu, I have always wished for you to pursue a role truly fitting of yourself. Your admiration of me is... flattering, and not entirely unexpected, given the circumstances, but I do not believe you to be capable of the violence my station demands.

**SCP-6907-1:** Then... why would you make me a god of death as you did?

**SCP-6907-2:** Ah, aha, slow down. I did no such thing. Your title was Lord of the End, which gave us a bit of leeway with what exactly you had to do.

//(SCP-6907-1 frowns.)//

**SCP-6907-2:** You simply clamored for a role, and you had already taken to mirroring aspects of my appearance and mannerisms. It was much easier to be seen as a great warrior before the advent of advanced technology, and I...

**Church:** //(quietly)// You felt bad for the poor sunovabitch.

**SCP-6907-2:** //(turns to look at Church)// Be //silent.// What are you doing over there, anyways?

//(Church had been writing a message to command recommending arming the response force with thaumaturgical weapons rated to neutralize class 5 Type Whites in order to neutralize SCP-6907-2 before it would be capable of mustering a response. He sends it and looks up to SCP-6907-2 before quickly returning his phone to his pocket.)//

**Church:** Sunova- Nothing! You&#39;re good! //(Church gives the entity a thumbs up and smiles, showing an abnormal amount of teeth, holding the pose for several seconds)//

**SCP-6907-2:** //(looks at Church for several seconds before shaking its head and turning back to SCP-6907-1)// Regardless, the simpleton is not entirely incorrect.

//(SCP-6907-1 looks at the ground.)//

**SCP-6907-1:** Am I little more than a curiosity to you?

**SCP-6907-2:** No. You misunderstand my intentions. I arranged your partnership with the Warden in the hope that you would find a passion while he grew his collection. Likewise, I arranged your excursions to be centuries apart in the hopes that you may find something else of interest to you. You could never stay under my direct guidance forever. In time, you would have to take on a more... self-deterministic role.

**SCP-6907-1:** I don&#39;t understand. I thought I was always meant to be as you told me.

**Watterson:** Time for a career change, man.

//(Moore hits Watterson for drawing the attention of the entities when not directly addressed. SCP-6907-2 stands up.)//

**SCP-6907-2:** Such a change is not such a grand affair as you think. //(turns to address Church)// Would you not think so, simpleton? //(appears to glare at Church)//

**Church:** Oh, aha, uh, yeah, for sure. I mean, I just work this job because I was good at competition shooting as a kid, you know? Gotta take something with job security, I thought, but I don&#39;t even like this shit, man. I like baking. So you should, ah, definitely listen to your sister.

//(SCP-6907-1 looks at SCP-6907-2 with its mouth open.)//

**SCP-6907-1:** I was struck down by a //baker.//

**SCP-6907-2:** All the more reason to forgo your title of Lord of the End for something new.

**SCP-6907-1:** I fear I do not excel in anything. I am likely to simply flounder without direction.

**SCP-6907-2:** Of course not. You give yourself too little credit. 

**SCP-6907-1:** Eresh-mla, name one thing that I am better at than anyone you know.

//(SCP-6907-2 smiles, but remains silent for several seconds.)//

**SCP-6907-2:** You are... quite handsome, you know?

**SCP-6907-1:** //Eresh-mla.//

//(SCP-6907-2 looks at Watterson, Moore, and Church and gestures vaguely.)//

**Moore:** Uh... Well, I didn&#39;t know you for long, but you have probably been the least dangerous thing I&#39;ve had to deal with, which I appreciate.

//(SCP-6907-1 groans and puts its face in its hands. SCP-6907-2 appears annoyed.)//

**Watterson:** Hey man, you can cry like a motherfucker. My sister&#39;s kids couldn&#39;t compete. 

//(SCP-6907-2 appears more annoyed, but assumes a neutral expression before addressing SCP-6907-1.)//

**SCP-6907-2:** Well, proficiency is gained through experience. It&#39;s more important for you to decide upon taking your title for something you feel you can truly embody. You like... //things,// right?

**SCP-6907-1:** I mean... I... think...

**SCP-6907-2:** Gardening. Right. You like gardening, yes?

**SCP-6907-1:** Well, it is a pastime of mine, but I do not think myself capable of obtaining such mastery of-

**SCP-6907-2:** This is merely a starting point. How does... a god of the harvest sound to you? 

**SCP-6907-1:** //(looks at the ground)// Impossible. Dendris is already the God of the Harvest.

**SCP-6907-2:** And you two are on fair terms, are you not? I recall he helped you with this nascent hobby of yours.

**SCP-6907-1:** Well, not if I intend to usurp him! 

**SCP-6907-2:** Ah, and what about it? How do you think I got into my position? I killed the one I had served as a supplicant. 

**SCP-6907-1:** Wha... but, I don&#39;t want- 

**SCP-6907-2:** Akendu, something you must learn is that if you wish to gain true independence, you must act in your own interests. Be it undercutting a competitor to gain worshippers, shutting out competition for the role of a supplicant, or making the rivers of another&#39;s domain run red with their blood. 

//(SCP-6907-1 looks at SCP-6907-2 with its mouth open.)//

**SCP-6907-1:** ...I //can&#39;t// do that! I don&#39;t //want// to do any of that! I thought you wanted me to get away from that!

**SCP-6907-2:** I am simply trying to prepare you for the world of being an independent deity. But, so be it. You can still preside over something adjacent to the harvest. How about... fertilizer? It can be the most important part of- wait-

**SCP-6907-1:** Are you saying I am suited only to be the god of excrement? //(looks to the side of the room and slumps into the chair)// Eresh-mla, I appreciate your boundless compassion, but really. Just kill me.

**SCP-6907-2:** Hush. I was merely dictating my stream of consciousness. How about... plants?

**SCP-6907-1:** //(frowns)// Wonderful. The God of Ginko Trees is sure to command respect. 

**SCP-6907-2:** No, no. The //concept// of plants. Or something close to it. Growth and blooming. 

**SCP-6907-1:** //(remains silent for a moment, then shakes its head)// Alas, I could not hope to embody such things.

//(Command requests more information in order to better tailor their response. Church nudges Watterson and towards the entities.)//

**Watterson:** Isn&#39;t that... kind of a broad thing to be the god of?

**SCP-6907-2:** //(turns to face Moore)// So long as there is something to dedicate yourself to, such concerns are irrelevant. //(faces SCP-6907-1)// Perhaps you are unfit now, but even ones such as us need the boon of experience. Why, when I first ascended, I was fit only to raze pre-industrial civilizations. Now look at me! I made a mockery of the finest armaments of this world.

**SCP-6907-1:** I just... I don&#39;t know...

**SCP-6907-2:** It is not a commitment. It is a start. Now, are you ready to return home?

//(SCP-6907-1 nods its head. Watterson, Moore, and Church are informed that Command is nearly ready to send in a response team to contain SCP-6907-2.)//

**Church:** Sunovabitch!

//(SCP-6907-2 looks back to Church with an angered expression, but takes a deep breath and returns its focus back to the wall in front of it. Distortions begin to appear on the wall.)//

**Moore:** Hey, wait a sec-

//(SCP-6907-2 breaks the restraints on SCP-6907-1 and faces the wall opposite to the door. Church pushes Moore through the doorway.)//

**Watterson:** Hey! Get back here!

**Moore:** Ah, you really can&#39;t leave. Yet. It&#39;s our job to keep you here, so could you at least wait until our boss shows up? 

//(Red liquid begins to exit the distortion and fall sideways, pooling on the wall. Moore looks back towards Church, who points at the entities with an intense expression.)//

**SCP-6907-2:** I apologize, but I must be taking my leave now. I have lingered here too long as it is. I suggest you vacate the room.

**Moore:** Oh, no, please. It&#39;s fine. You guys, like, uh, plants? I have a garden in my backyard. //(takes his phone out of his pocket)// Look, I have bell peppers. I-I can at least give you some ideas.

**SCP-6907-2:** I- //(sighs)//

//(SCP-6907-2 turns around and walks towards Moore. Watterson looks away and Church covers his eyes with his hands. SCP-6907-2 then places its hands on either side of Moore&#39;s torso and lifts him off the ground, placing him on the opposite side of the doorway. It then returns to SCP-6907-1, with the far wall covered entirely in red liquid.)//

**SCP-6907-1:** //(looks at the doorway and clears throat)// Well, ah, my time here... has been-

**SCP-6907-2:** You don&#39;t have to do this, Akendu.

**SCP-6907-1:** Oh thank the Triumvirate. 

//(Both entities then walk into the pool of liquid before it appears to collapse in on itself, disappearing entirely along with both entities.)//

**Church:** Sunovabitch!
