+ ARTWORK EXCHANGE GIFT FOR [[*user Perdoh]]!

&gt; The request was &#34;song lyrics from a K-Class event survivor&#34;, and well- here it is!
&gt; There&#39;s no direct inspiration from this - the names are just names, the events are just events - but the story I was trying to tell was of a young reality bender named Mary Rice, who escaped containment and destroyed the world in her rebellion. The protagonist&#39;s sister was a Foundation Researcher, and was killed in the fall out. This is the song of how it all went down.


 History’s a loaded gun
Wielded by Mary Rice
She aimed the trigger at the sun and shot between the eyes

I stood at my black window
Watched the scorching skies
I turned the news to ITV, and saw her nightmares visualise

And the great Hartford fire[[footnote]] Note: Keeping in with the theme of the Foundation as a circus (making a fool of themselves), I referenced the Hartford Circus fire of 1944, which was one of the worst fire disasters in U.S history. [[/footnote]] has nothing on this tribulation 
A site for sore eyes, red and cracked from devastation
Nation’s rise and fall under the ringmaster’s hand, lab rats in white coats scurry to the piping band 

She says
“If I think, then I am, and I am the eye
There is no difference between me and the sky
If I was, then I will, and I have been on the rise”
CK class collapsing kingdoms, gentrified time 

At the end of the world we’ll sing the old rugged cross
Will it fall on us? Will it fall on us?
At the end of my mind I’ll turn the stars to dust
Will they be enough? Will it be enough?
To start the exodus?

Reality’s a paintbrush
Smudged across the skies
Ms. Rice under emerald soot, clouds of russet wine 

Under midnight’s golden blush 
My sister holds me tight  
Her lab coat stained with lapis blood, her tears apologise 

And the Mongol forces would have nothing on this desolation
Consensus says surrender your armies, prepare for your abdication
They tried their best to toss her to the can, with a subtle wink she slipped her chains and pushed Houdini from his stand 

They say
“Nothing can stop her, from her ascension
Not her honour, proper convention  
If not her puppets, then her playbook
Nor apotheosis, or her sainthood”


At the end of the world we’ll sing the old rugged cross[[footnote]] &#34;The Old Rugged Cross&#34; is a song historically tied to funerals, which makes sense - it&#39;s a funeral for the world. However, it&#39;s also a song about finding beauty in suffering - which ties in to the artistic language I tried to incorporate.  [[/footnote]]
Will it fall on us? Will it fall on us?
At the end of my mind I’ll turn the stars to dust
Will they be enough? Will it be enough?
To start the exodus?


At the end of the world we’ll sing the old rugged cross
Will it fall on us? Will it fall on us?
At the end of my mind I’ll turn the stars to dust
Will they be enough? Will it be enough?
To start the exodus?

Is death an apology
For the mistakes of life?
Do we live in Mary’s world now?
Or do we just survive?
