&gt; ##green|**EndlessSpace**## 6/12/2023 (Monday) 10:35:15 #49105834
&gt; ------
&gt; When I was a child, there used to be these things called &#34;late movies.&#34; Back then, they used to show these films at 11:00 or later, far past my bedtime. Regardless, one night I desired to watch one of these films, and decided to sneak out when my parents were asleep. I stealthily made my way to the couch, turned on the TV, and lowered the volume to where it was loud enough for me to hear, but not loud enough for my parents to hear. 
&gt; 
&gt; That night, I believe it was playing a classic B-grade horror flick, and I was enthralled. Never before had I seen such violence on TV, even if nowadays it may fall flat. Sadly, I got tired around halfway through the movie, and fell into a slumber.
&gt; 
&gt; I woke up in the middle of the night to static on the screen. I dragged myself off the couch, hoping to turn off the TV and head to my bedroom. Just as I nearly turned the dial, a show came on. Intrigued, I decided to let it play out for a bit. The TV set wasn&#39;t in black and white, but for some reason this show was. 
&gt; 
&gt; Then, a man showed up on screen. He was a very tall man, even while sitting in his chair. He looked about 70, but not the kind of 70 that your grandparents would be. No, he looked calm, with a perpetual expression of neutrality on his face, and his eyes looked as if they were judging your every action with their gaze and accepting them at the same time. 
&gt; 
&gt; Then, in the calmest voice I had ever heard, the man said, &#34;How do you feel about the way your life is going?&#34; Confused, I sat back down, waiting to see what this man was going on about. &#34;I know what your life will be like. You&#39;ll grow up, get a job, work for 60 years, retire, and die. Is that how you want your life to be?&#34; I was confused. I had never really pondered the question, and even if I had, what choice did I have otherwise? 
&gt; 
&gt; The man spoke once more. &#34;There is an alternative. Your life can be different. It can be... unique. Special, even. Something... extraordinary.&#34; I had no idea what he was referring to, but I was intrigued. Then, the man spoke for one final time. &#34;In just a few seconds, a number should appear on screen. I want you to call that number on the phone. Doesn&#39;t matter what phone you have, or even if it&#39;s your phone. All I need is for you to call.&#34; The screen turned black, and a number appeared on the TV. That number was something like 555-NEXT, if I recall correctly.
&gt; 
&gt; I was intrigued. I went over to the phone, and inputted the numbers. I was excited to see what this could be. I picked up the phone, and put it to my ear. I heard a voice, calm in nature. I remember the conversation we had down to the letter.
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Welcome. Are you ready?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Yes.&#34; I said back.
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;You accept all that will come afterward.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Y-Yes.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;You accept that things will be better from here on out.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Um... Y-Yes?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;You accept that you will leave this world behind.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;W-What?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Answer.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; It was at this moment I really thought about what I was getting into, and I had no idea. I hung up, and I never called again. To this day, I wonder what would have happened had I said &#34;Yes.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Why am I telling you this, you ask? I happen to be a fan of lost media, and I think it&#39;s definitely possible that we could find this again. If anyone has any information about it, or if they even have a recording of it, please reply below.

&gt; Well, this just unlocked childhood memories.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;ve seen that ad before. There was something distinctly disturbing about it. Maybe it was the fact that he sounds like he&#39;s always berating you.

&gt; This is surprisingly well detailed for an event that apparently happened over 40 years ago? Feels more like a creepypasta to me, and not a well written one. Stuff like this shouldn&#39;t be allowed on the site.

&gt; Wow, I didn&#39;t think anyone else ever thought about this. I&#39;ve had my own experience with this ad, but it&#39;s a little different to what you described.
&gt; 
&gt; Me and my father were watching TV late at night, because I was sick and couldn&#39;t sleep. There wasn&#39;t much on this late at night, so he just flipped through the channels. Most of them were static. But eventually, he found a channel with the ad playing on it. He said pretty much the same thing you said. I do distinctly remember him being a lot more sinister than you recall, however. My father, on the other hand, was intrigued. He got up from his chair and called practically immediately.
&gt; 
&gt; On the phone, he kept saying &#34;Yes&#34; to each of the questions. I assume he got to the final one? But what was really interesting is what happened the next day.
&gt; 
&gt; The next day, my father left the house. It was pretty typical of him to go to work early, so I didn&#39;t think of it. However, my father never returned. The disturbing part? When I asked my mother about what happened to him, she said, &#34;Your father? I don&#39;t think you have one.&#34;

I remember something about this ad too. Only thing is, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s sitting on a chair. It was more like a throne of some kind. Creepy.

&gt; Hey! I happen to be a connoisseur of old advertisements, and I&#39;d love to know a little more about this. Many TV advertisements can only play in specific regions, so if you want more info, you should probably tell me a little bit about where you were when the ad aired.

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;parapost reply2&#34;]]
##green|**EndlessSpace**## 6/18/2023 (Sunday) 11:21:56 #49105834
&gt; Excellent. Let me tell you a little bit about what I remember.
&gt; 
&gt; The ad aired at around 3:00 at night, in the southern Texas region. I don&#39;t precisely remember the day, but I believe it was the 25th of August, or at least some time in it. 
&gt;
&gt; I believe the ad was likely independent. I can&#39;t remember whether it was aired on cable or not, unfortunately. 
&gt; 
&gt; That reminds me, has anyone tried calling the number yet? I&#39;m quite curious to see what happens.
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;parapost reply2&#34;]]
##white|**ElderWho**## 6/19/2023 (Monday) 5:31:53 #30607891
------
&gt; No, I haven&#39;t called it. If I were you, I wouldn&#39;t have posted the number, as for all you know, it could&#39;ve been replaced by someone&#39;s actual number.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, your advice was rather useful. I&#39;ll look over some old commercial clips I have stored just in case, but it&#39;s more likely that I don&#39;t have it. It&#39;s a start, though.

&gt; Alright, got some good news and some bad news for you folks.
&gt; 
&gt; The bad news is that I don&#39;t have the tape. The good news is that I know someone who does. A friend of mine from the region says he&#39;s seen the ad on an old recording of a movie he once watched, so I&#39;m going to fly down there and help him format it to a video. It&#39;ll take some time to properly format it to modern hardware, but it&#39;s only a matter of time. Once I&#39;m finished, I&#39;ll email you a copy.
&gt; 
&gt; Never thought this would be so easy. :)

&gt; Good. Say, I still live in that area to this day. Do you mind if I come by and help? I&#39;d love to see the ad again for the first time in who knows how many years. We could meet at the restaurant on Parker road, if you&#39;re up to it.

&gt; Please call 555-NEXT now. You won&#39;t regret it. Thank you for your time.
