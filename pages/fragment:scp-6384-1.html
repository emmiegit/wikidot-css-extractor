**Special Containment Procedures:** Compounds 6384-A and 6384-B are currently under mass production in Site-56&#39;s Amnestic Substance Refinery. Standard distribution permissions are to be followed regarding these substances.

SCP-6384-EX is contained in Site-56&#39;s Vehicle Containment Garage for posterity.

**Description:** SCP-6384-EX is a 1992 Hanwoo Harmony passenger sedan outfitted with a device used to disperse aerosol amnestic substances of previously unknown composition.[[footnote]] The substances were later determined to be of cannabinoid origin; initial research was hindered due to the Foundation&#39;s previous lack of focused study regarding cannabinoid compounds. [[/footnote]] The device was built and installed by Amnestics Researcher Vernon Douglas prior to his tenure at the Foundation. In addition, Researcher Douglas had developed a separate compound to counteract the amnestic.

SCP-6384-EX was recovered from Slipchester, Nevada, USA on March 25, 1995 by Nevada law enforcement; Foundation operatives transported it to Site-56 for further study. Through investigation, then-civilian Douglas was revealed to be its owner.

Following negotiation, Researcher Douglas volunteered to recreate the substances used in SCP-6384-EX in exchange for employment at the Foundation. The substances were successfully reengineered in September 1995; the amnestics and mnestics were designated Compounds 6384-A and 6384-B, respectively. The vehicle was reclassified as Explained; provisional testing continued under the supervision of Senior Researcher Melissa Mitchell. 

Due to their ease of use, increased potency, and quicker application time over previous capsule-based provisions, the compounds were implemented on March 1996 as standard Class-A amnestic and Class-W mnestic provisions for Foundation field agents. 

The following transcript depicts the first introduction of Compounds 6384-A and 6384-B to high-ranking Foundation personnel on March 25, 1996.

= **Transcript 6384-7**
------
**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

//Researcher Douglas enters the chamber, pushing a cart stocked with a CPAP mask connected to an amnestic canister, as well as multiple bottles.//

//A single D-class personnel, D-6744, is strapped to a chair in the center of the chamber.//

//Douglas approaches the D-class. He turns to face the observation window where multiple Foundation personnel are watching.//

**Douglas:** Good morning, everyone. I&#39;m Vernon Douglas, Researcher at the Department of Amnestics here at Site-56. Today I will demonstrate, for the first time, how to administer the Foundation&#39;s new Class-A aerosol amnestics. They&#39;re designed to be much easier to administer to both civilians who see something they&#39;re not supposed to see, and personnel leaving an SCP research project. But before I show you how...

//Researcher Douglas takes out a small cup and a bottle, pours a small amount of green liquid into the cup, and holds it up for the observing personnel.//

**Douglas:** //This// is our new liquid-based Class-W mnestic designed to neutralize the effects of the Class-A. Take a sip of this, about five milliliters, no more than a teaspoon prior to handling any amnestics, to mitigate the effects of accidental self-application. 

//Researcher Douglas drinks the mnestics and sets the empty cup back on the cart.//

**Douglas:** Tastes like Mountain Dew, but with some Sprite mixed in. It&#39;ll have a slight aftertaste, but it beats forgetting something you shouldn&#39;t. 

**D-6744:** Can I have some?

**Douglas:** Um... not now. And I believe you&#39;ve been instructed to remain quiet.

**D-6744:** Right... sorry. 

//Researcher Douglas grabs the CPAP mask and prepares its strap.//

**Douglas:** There were a few snags during development; the new Class-W mnesitc would strengthen certain people&#39;s memory to the point of practical immunity to our other amnestic offerings...

//He glances at D-6744.//

**Douglas:** But we&#39;ve managed to tweak the new Class-A amnestics to... successfully override the new immunity should it ever occur. 

//Researcher Douglas begins to clamp the CPAP mask onto D-6744&#39;s face.//

**Douglas:** This particular D-Class... he&#39;s... a very good baseline for our tests.

//He secures the mask onto D-6744 and turns towards the observers.//

**Douglas:** Once the mask has been secured, it&#39;s finally time to administer our new Class-A.

//Researcher Douglas turns towards the aerosol canister on the cart and turns its nozzle. A hissing sound is produced as the gauge on top begins to move.//

**Douglas:** Have the Class-A going for one minute; accuracy&#39;s not the most important for this step, but don&#39;t go over a minute and a half. Make sure the subject&#39;s breathing it all in. 

//He leans forward to check D-6744&#39;s breathing, then looks back at the gauge on top of the canister.//

**Douglas:** One minute is equivalent to 25 milligrams of the stuff, so watch that gauge carefully. You don&#39;t want to overdo it. And... //there// we go. 

//Researcher Douglas turns the nozzle off. The hissing noise stops. He turns and gestures towards D-6744.//

**Douglas:** Now this D-class is ready for another month of service.

//He removes the CPAP mask from D-6744, sets it on the cart, and turns to the audience.//

**Douglas:** As you can see, our new Class-A amnestics are significantly easier and //quicker// to administer. No more discretely taking civilians to Sites for amnestic treatment, no more subjecting D-classes to five-hour surgeries, and //no more// complications from such surgeries. 

**Douglas:** That concludes my demonstration of the Foundation&#39;s next generation of amnestics. It was quite an honor to work with this organization, and I couldn&#39;t have done it without our Lead Department Researcher, Melissa Mitchell.

//The observers give a round of applause as Researcher Douglas begins to push the cart towards the chamber exit. He pauses and looks back at D-6744.//

**Douglas:** Goodbye, Z. 

//He proceeds to exit the chamber with the cart.//

**&lt;End Log&gt;**
