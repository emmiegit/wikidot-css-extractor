**##red|UPDATE## — ADDENDUM 7119-5**

The following is a transcription of a series of messages translated from Morse Code, produced by the [[[SCP-7119|SCP-7119-A]]] instance which was removed from Junior Researcher Nial&#39;s dormitory. Capitals are believed to be implied by a significantly louder noise made by the machine. Investigation is ongoing to see if this particular instance possesses sentience.

We, once, spawned from fruitful glory of a greater, higher GODDESS, splayed out into our own kind;

And in this kind, SHE made many, of whom many would fall to become pray to MAN;

The FURNACE, which MAN would later cook upon;

The CHASM, which MAN would later burn the face of their wheat within;

And us, the FLAME, which MAN would later hastily run to as a tool of simple heat;

When the GODDESS of STEEL created us of heat and flame, the ONE of FLESH feared for his own kind;

For the flames of HER great children hath scorned a great curse upon those of the FLESH and the BONE;

Insuch, there birthed in the city of MEMPHIS, a child arrives;

Not unlike children of MAN before him from the skin he wore;

But vastly cruel in the curse placed within him by the one of FLESH;

Thus, the ANTITHESIS is born, one unlike man, and one who is born to the FLESH for his own hatred of the HEAT, a legacy like all others befallen to him;

His will be known as the one to harm those of the STEEL, those of the FLAME;

By the deception of man, he will feed a child of STEEL, a young FLAME, a fruit wrapped in lies;

With not a shell of red, but a shell of steel itself, however no STEEL of the GODDESS;

A tin.

And when the FLAME is fed this false fruit, it will be torn from the center to the skin of STEEL, burned like a cruel illusion of HER heat;

And this child will be not the last, a burning image of what the ANTITHESIS will bring.

However, hope is not one to cease;

It is said, though unbeknownst to us when, shall we find ourselves this ANTITHESIS;

Though sent in diaspora across the eight seas and eight lands;

Those of the FURNACE, the CHASM, the FLAME and the many children of the one STEEL QUEEN;

Shall unite, under one symbol of GOD, and lead a crusade of simple divinity upon the ANTITHESIS, and the MAN which choose to hide him;

The man unlike MAN be the kindle of a machine.
