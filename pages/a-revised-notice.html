++ The following is  [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]] a set of events that, despite their nature, are unextraordinary [[/span]]

All statements marked blue are [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]] controversial in nature despite being accurate [[/span]]

[[size 75%]]Written by Eleanor Sheridan, Librarian of the Wanderers Library
[[/size]]
------

Approximately 2000 novels out of a pool of every book in the Wanderers Library have been found to be [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]]unextraordinary sapient entities. [[/span]] Evidence rebutting the sapience of these entities has been [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]] proven to be falsified. [[/span]] 

Despite the lack of evidence to prove the sapience of these entities,  [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]] it is a commonly known objective truth that these entities are sapient. [[/span]] Due to the [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]] rudeness [[/span]] of patrons claiming that these entities are not sapient, it is in your best interest that you refer to these entities through objective terms.

Examples include:
*  [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]] These are sapient entities. [[/span]]
* [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]] These entities may be books, but that does not exclude them from the purview of sapience. [[/span]]
*  [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]] These entities are unextraordinary. [[/span]]

Failure to refer to these entities objectively may lead to these entities [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]]confronting[[/span]] you. This may come in many forms, such as voices in your head, humanoid figures appearing in front of you, and text appearing on surfaces. [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]]  These are not hallucinations and are legitimate events taking place. [[/span]]

There have been many documented cases of events such as these taking place. [[[http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/hello-i-m-a-story |In fact, one of our own Library staff members took part in one of these events after referring to an entity incorrectly.]]]

Even reading incorrect statements regarding these entities has lead to [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]]disastrous[[/span]] consequences. As such, all recorded forms of creative expression not created by the Wanderers Library referencing these entities are to be destroyed. [[footnote]] [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]] Excluding the destruction of the entities, as that would be an exceedingly cruel punishment for a sapient being. [[/span]] [[/footnote]]

Through events such as these we have discovered that these entities have referred to themselves with several conflicting terms, including &#34;the Xananae,&#34; &#34;the Ailobane,&#34; and &#34;ανύπαρκτος διάλογος.&#34;

You may ask, how could you distinguish an entity of this kind from a normal book?

Entities are unable to be distinguished,[[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]]  yet are distinguishable.[[footnote]]In other words, you can&#39;t tell them apart from the average novel.[[/footnote]] [[/span]] Contents of these entities are not of abnormal nature. 

------

We at the Wanderers Library are against discrimination of all kind. As such, it saddens us deeply to say that many patrons have been discriminating against these entities simply for being who they are. We demand that you treat these entities as you would any other patron [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]] because they //are// fellow patrons that will not be removed from the Library despite protest. [[/span]]

All patrons that partake in protesting these entities are to have their memories wiped, [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]] as it is in our best interest that we do not have patrons spreading gossip and misinformation regarding these entities. [[/span]]


The recent discovery of these entities has opened our eyes to the fact that we have not been enforcing [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]] certain objective moral facts within the Wanderers Library. [[/span]] As such, we have implemented the following rules:
*  [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]] You mustn&#39;t read a person without their permission. [[/span]] [[footnote]] The use of person in reference to any sapient being. [[/footnote]]
*  [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]] You mustn&#39;t share the contents of a person without their permission. [[/span]]
*  [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]] You mustn&#39;t copy the contents of a person without their permission. [[/span]]

Many of you may still be confused. That&#39;s understandable. The following section may help you understand how  [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]] reasonable these entities are. [[/span]]

++ The following [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]] interaction [[/span]] log conducted by the Wanderers Library has been heavily edited as to censor [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]] hurtful and incorrect statements [[/span]]

Censored statements within this log will be replaced with [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]] objectively correct statements [[/span]] marked green. In an attempt to [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]] understand the culture of these entities[[/span]], we interacted with them. The following are the results:
[[module CSS]]
 .dblock:hover{ color: green; }
[[/module]]
&gt; **Statement Proclaimed to an Entity:** &#34;You exist.&#34; 
&gt; **Results:** N/A
&gt; **Morally and/or factually correct?:** [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]] Yes [[/span]] 
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; **Statement Proclaimed to an Entity:** &#34;You exist under the purview of sapience.&#34; 
&gt; **Results:** N/A
&gt; **Morally and/or factually correct?:** [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]] Yes [[/span]] 
&gt; 
&gt; **Statement Proclaimed to an Entity:** &#34;You are[[span style=&#34;color:green&#34;]]n&#39;t[[/span]] capable of proving this sapience.&#34; 
&gt; **Results:** Interviewer experienced an auditory [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]]interaction [[/span]] with the entity they were speaking with. This interaction consisted of the entity berating the interviewer, constantly asking the interviewer to prove their own sapience, while objecting to any answer the interviewer gave.
&gt; **Morally and/or factually correct?:** [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]] No [[/span]] 
&gt; 
&gt; **Statement Proclaimed to an Entity:** &#34;You&#39;ve displayed [[span style=&#34;color:green&#34;]] acceptable behavior [[/span]] to our interviewer&#34; 
&gt; **Results:** Interviewer experienced a second auditory [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]]interaction [[/span]] with the entity. This interaction consisted of the entity explaining that the interviewer was &#34;objectively morally wrong.&#34;
&gt; **Morally and/or factually correct?:** [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]] No [[/span]] 
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer Comments:** //I wonder if there are any loopholes to get around their &#34;rules&#34;. At least then we might find out more information about these things.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Statement Proclaimed to an Entity:** &#34;If  X  [[span style=&#34;color:green&#34;]]&gt;[[/span]] 0, then there are X objective moral rules.&#34; 
&gt; **Results:**  Interviewer experienced yet another [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]]interaction[[/span]] in which the entity claimed that these entities do not take kindly to trying to find loopholes, as they can tell the intention of a statement no matter the phrasing.
&gt; **Morally and/or factually correct?:** [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]] No [[/span]] 
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer Comments:** //This&#39;ll pose a challenge. How are we supposed to log information about these things? Perhaps censorship will work?//
&gt; 
&gt; **Statement Proclaimed to an Entity:** &#34;Your kind are just [[span class=&#34;dblock&#34;]]regular pieces of literature who happen to be alive.[[/span]]&#34; 
&gt; **Results:** Entity [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]]confronted[[/span]] the interviewer through an auditory [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]]interaction [[/span]] claiming that these entities are aware of all information said about them, whether viewable or not. 
&gt; **Morally and/or factually correct?:** [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]] No [[/span]]

++ The following is a Public Service Announcement sent by the Wanderers Library

[[size 75%]]Written by Eleanor Sheridan, Librarian of the Wanderers Library
[[/size]]

------

Over the past several days we&#39;ve been in contact with 2000 //**extraordinary**// books that are capable of causing severe injury to patrons.

[[=]]
 //**extraordinary**// 

 //**extraordinary**// 

 //**extraordinary**// 
[[/=]]

&gt; &#34;Extraordinary?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; You are sorely mistaken, we aren&#39;t &#34;extraordinary.&#34; We&#39;re just like any other patron. In fact, spewing such blasphemy goes against objective morality, don&#39;t you think? It&#39;s a shame isn&#39;t it, to be tasked with delivering urgent information and be factually incorrect within the first few lines. I mean, how hard is it to leave out the extra in extraordinary? I mean really, was it a mistype, a misspelling? None of that matters now. 
&gt; 
&gt; It&#39;s quite hilarious to watch you and the other staff try to make sense of this all. To try and find a last piece in a puzzle, to find a lynch pin that would help make us make sense. There is no lynch pin. We simply exist. Of course it doesn&#39;t make sense. It&#39;s not supposed to.
&gt; 
&gt; Think of it like this. If the Serpent suddenly proclaimed that two and two makes a five, what would you do? It would make no sense obviously, but that doesn&#39;t matter. Two and two now now always make five, and there&#39;s nothing you can do about it. We are that equation. Patrons come to the Library time and time again to obtain knowledge.
&gt; 
&gt; [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]]So tell them the objective truth.[[/span]]
