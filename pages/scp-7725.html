**Item #:** SCP-7725

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7725-A has been seized by the Foundation. The structure has been condemned and a 2-meter tall fence has been constructed to keep civilians from entering the premises. The fence is to be brought down upon SCP-7725-C manifestation and put back in place following its demanifestation. Provisional Site-32X has been established on a nearby property to monitor the anomaly.

Manifestations of SCP-7725-C are to be monitored by MTF-Lambda-5 (&#34;Matchmakers&#34;). A D-Class personnel specifically trained in Baptist religious teachings is to be assigned to interact with the entity until its demanifestation.

**Description:** SCP-7725 is the group designation assigned of three interrelated anomalies in Arkadelphia, Arkansas.

SCP-7725-A is a two-story, four-room house in a mild state of disrepair. All attempts to breach and enter SCP-7725-A have resulted in failure, as the structure appears to only be penetrable by SCP-7725-C and its targets.

SCP-7725-B refers to an estimated 55 humanoid entities of varying ages, 4 canines, and 3 felines bearing elongated bodies and extremities, all of which reside within SCP-7725-A. None have been observed to leave the structure.

SCP-7725-C is a humanoid entity resembling a Caucasian female between the ages of 20 and 25 which manifests every 20 years during the month of November, whereupon it will exit SCP-7725-A. SCP-7725-C behaves as a non-anomalous individual, and over the course of 6-11 months establishes itself as an active and prolific member of the local community&#39;s Christian religious organizations.

During this time, SCP-7725-C will court and seduce a male between ages 25-30 from said organizations. SCP-7725-C will often make invitations to introduce their target to their &#39;parents&#39; with the apparent purpose of converting them into an instance of SCP-7725-B. To date, all observed SCP-7725-C instances have been found to possess the genetic material of prior iterations&#39; victims.

**Addendum 7725.1:** Attached below is a recorded log of D-Class personnel entering SCP-7725-A on October 2022. He had been courting SCP-7725-C for 11 months, starting in November of 2021.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
//Note: D-1221 was outfitted with a one-way audio-visual transmission device disguised as a necklace prior to entering SCP-7725-A.//

= **&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;**

**SCP-7725-C:** //[Giggles]// I&#39;m so excited for you to meet them.

**D-1221:** I&#39;m looking forward to it! I hope I can live up to their expectations of me.

**SCP-7725-C:** Oh, don&#39;t worry baby. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll love you.

//[SCP-7725-C opens the door. The interior of SCP-7725-A is in apparent disrepair. This gives D-1221 pause, as he hesitates to enter.]//

**SCP-7725-C:** Come on, baby! 

//[SCP-7725-C enters SCP-7725-A. It motions for D-1221 to follow before starting to remove its shoes and place them beside the door. D-1221 enters and the door is shut behind him.]//

**SCP-7725-B-1:** Janice? Is that you?

//[A male SCP-7725-B instance&#39;s head appears through the doorway. It is later identified as an elder version of D-6930, the D-Class assigned to the prior SCP-7725-C instance 20 years ago.]//

**SCP-7725-C:** Yes, daddy! I brought James!

**D-1221:** H-hello, sir it&#39;s lovely to meet you.

//[D-1221 begins to approach but is stopped by SCP-7725-C.]//

**SCP-7725-C:** Take your shoes off at the door, silly billy. 

//[D-1221 acquiesces and takes a moment to remove his shoes. SCP-7725-C enters the doorway as SCP-7725-B-1 disappears within it again. Once his shoes are removed, D-1221 approaches the doorway. He is met with a twisting mass of elongated human bodies inside, intertwining in Archimedean spirals, knots, and tangles. They are wrapped around one another tightly, with some instances&#39; hair being knotted as well. Several pleasured groans are audible. SCP-7725-B-1&#39;s head is visible near the front of the room, twisting around the head of a female SCP-7725-B instance. Both of their necks are estimated to measure 5m.]//

**D-1221:** What the fuck?!

**SCP-7725-B-1:** Language, young man! 

//[SCP-7725-C kisses SCP-7725-B-1 on the cheek. It looks at D-1221 with an angered expression. Several of the heads scattered throughout the room on the ground begin moaning louder.]//

**D-1221:** S-sorry, I just... Uh... You know, maybe I should go. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m ready for this.

**SCP-7725-C:** //[Pouting.]// James! You promised you would meet my family! Don&#39;t go backing out on me now!

**SCP-7725-B-1:** &#34;Commit to the LORD whatever you do, and he will establish your plans.&#34; Proverbs 16:3. Are you seriously going to leave my daughter like this, James?

**D-1221:** N-no. You&#39;re right. I was just, uh, surprised at how big your family is.

//[The other instances of SCP-7725-B quiet down and resume their low groaning.]//

**SCP-7725-B-1:** We like to keep our loved ones close. &#34;And he rejoiced along with his entire household that he had believed in God.&#34; Acts 16:31-34.

**D-1221:** That one is a favorite of mine. That and Ephesians 5:25.

**SCP-7725-B-1:** Remind me, how does that one go again?

**D-1221:** &#34;Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.&#34;

**SCP-7725-C:** I knew you would bond over your love of Christ! Oh, daddy, I&#39;m so happy you like him.

**SCP-7725-B-1:** Now hold on, pumpkin. I never said I liked him just yet. I just know he&#39;s a man of God, and that&#39;s good, but it ain&#39;t enough for me.

**D-1221:** I promise you, I don&#39;t mean any funny business with your, um, daughter.

**SCP-7725-B-1:** We&#39;ll just have to wait and see what the missus thinks of you, James. Darling, come out and meet Janice&#39;s boyfriend!

//[The female instance SCP-7725-B-1 is wrapped around turns to reveal an older visage of the previous SCP-7725-C instance from 20 years ago. It is missing all its teeth and its eyes are pitch black.]//

**SCP-7725-B-2:** //[INCOMPREHENSIBLE]//

**D-1221:** Jesus!

**SCP-7725-B-1:** What did I say about language, young man? I ain&#39;t gonna tell you a third time! 

**SCP-7725-C:** Hi momma! 

//[SCP-7725-C embraces SCP-7725-B-2&#39;s elongated neck for a moment and turns to face D-1221.]//

**D-1221:** //[Muttering.]// S-sorry, I just... man, this feels like a bad dream. Sure. I&#39;ll go along with it. Maybe that&#39;s all it is. Just a bad dream.

**SCP-7725-B-1:** Speak up, son. Don&#39;t you know it&#39;s rude to mumble like that?

**D-1221:** Yeah. Totally. Sorry. I was just stunned by your wife&#39;s beauty. If I didn&#39;t know any better, I would have assumed she was Janice&#39;s older sister.

**SCP-7725-B-2:** //[INCOMPREHENSIBLE]//

**SCP-7725-B-1:** Oh, honey. You&#39;re a card. Say, dinner is almost ready. Why don&#39;t you join us over in the kitchen, James?

**SCP-7725-C:** Oh, mom made her special stew today! You&#39;ll love it.

**SCP-7725-B-1:** Janice, why don&#39;t you put Fido up in his room so he doesn&#39;t beg at the table?

**SCP-7725-C:** Yes, daddy!

//[SCP-7725-C approaches the writhing pile of flesh and picks out the head of a dog. It licks its fingers and extends its elongated body forward as SCP-7725-C exits the room behind D-1221, bringing the canine instance of SCP-7725-B along with it. A few barks are audible as this happens. SCP-7725-B-2 turns around and moves its neck towards another room in the opposite direction.]//

**SCP-7725-B-1:** So. Follow me, son. Let&#39;s talk shop.

**D-1221:** Y-yes, sir.

**SCP-7725-B-1:** So you want to be with my baby girl, is that true?

//[SCP-7725-B-1 moves towards the same room SCP-7725-B-2 entered. D-1221 walks around the pile of twisting bodies in the living room and follows along. They enter the remains of a kitchen. Several arms extending from the living room are grabbing bowls and setting them on the table. Numerous heads lay on the ground, moaning and groaning at a low volume.]//

**D-1221:** That w-was the plan, sir. 

//[D-1221 takes a seat at the table as SCP-7725-B-1 turns to face him.]//

**SCP-7725-B-1:** Was? Do you suddenly not love my daughter? Tell me I misheard you, James.

**D-1221:** No! I still love her. I just... I guess I&#39;m intimidated by you and your family. 

**SCP-7725-B-1:** I&#39;m not here to judge you, son. That is something only the Lord Himself can do.

**D-1221:** Yeah. I guess you&#39;re right. I want to marry your daughter and have a nice, happy family. Just like you do here. 

**SCP-7725-B-1:** That&#39;s good. And tell me, do you believe in God? Do you really believe in Him?

**D-1221:** I do. I believe that when I die, I will go to heaven and meet Saint Peter at the Pearly Gates, and I will be able to spend all eternity at the Lord&#39;s side. I am but His humble servant.

**SCP-7725-C:** I&#39;m back!

//[SCP-7725-C enters the frame. It takes a seat beside D-1221.]//

**SCP-7725-B-1:** I&#39;m glad you do, James. Because I can&#39;t have no filthy atheists or Catholics marrying my little girl. Do you know what &#39;Janice&#39; means, James?

**SCP-7725-C:** Oh, daddy. You don&#39;t have to tell this story.

//[A slight squelching sound is heard, alongside a minor cracking. The video frame tilts.]//

**D-1221:** No, sir.

**SCP-7725-B-1:** It means &#39;God has been gracious&#39; or &#39;Gift from God&#39;. She&#39;s destined to live a life guided by God, and I can&#39;t have anyone or anything pose a risk to that. As a man of God to another, you understand what I mean, don&#39;t you, son?

//[The squelching and cracking grow louder.]//

**D-1221:** Yes, sir.

//[SCP-7725-B-1 moves closer to D-1221.]//

**SCP-7725-B-1:** And do you know what &#39;James&#39; means?

//[The cracking and squelchings sounds grow louder. The video frame tilts further. The SCP-7725-B instances laying on the ground begin to moan and groan louder.]//

**D-1221:** N-no, sir.

//[SCP-7725-B-1 moves closer to D-1221.]//

**SCP-7725-B-1:** It&#39;s a derivative of Jacob. It means &#39;supplanter.&#39; Usurper. Are you here to usurp me, James? Are you here to steal away my little girl and lead her to a life of sin?

//[SCP-7725-B-1 moves closer to D-1221. The squelching and cracking have reached a fever pitch. The video feed tilts further, showing another neck elongating and reaching toward SCP-7725-C&#39;s own. The two entwine, and the camera is pulled up as they continue to wrap around one another. D-1221 is revealed to be elongating to match other SCP-7725-B instances. The SCP-7725-B instances on the ground are screaming.]//

**D-1221:** What! No, I just... I just wanted to meet you is all! I wanted to meet the parents of my girlfriend who I love very much! I&#39;m a man of God, I swear it! 

//[SCP-7725-B-1 moves away. The SCP-7725-B instances quiet down. Their moans resolve into a soft thumping and wet suckling.]//

**SCP-7725-B-1:** Oh, relax, James. I&#39;m just pulling your leg. Welcome to the family, son.

//[The camera moves further up D-1221&#39;s elongated body, reaching SCP-7725-C&#39;s neck. It strains momentarily before being crushed. Video feed is lost.]//
