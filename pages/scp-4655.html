**Item #:** SCP-4655

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4655 is kept in a standard Safe-class containment chamber. Within the containment chamber, a single overhead lamp constructed for the manifestation of SCP-4655-1 instances is to remain dimly lit at all times. Personnel that have lost a relative or partner within the last 5 years are restricted from SCP-4655&#39;s containment chamber. 

**Description:** SCP-4655 is a twin-sized bed decorated with a pink bedsheet.

SCP-4655&#39;s primary anomalous property manifests upon an individual sitting or laying on the item. In order to activate SCP-4655&#39;s anomalous properties, said individual must have a relative or loved one who has died within the last five years.

Upon an individual activating SCP-4655&#39;s anomalous properties, the subject will experience extremely heightened senses of grief and depression alongside difficulty focusing on tasks. The subject&#39;s emotional distress is caused by any and all relatives or loved ones the subject knew who have died in the last five years.

SCP-4655&#39;s secondary portion to its anomalous property only occurs if there is any portion of the room completely unexposed to light. Should this factor be present, a pale humanoid entity (deemed SCP-4655-1) will simultaneously manifest within the dark portion of the room and slowly move towards the subject. The anatomy of SCP-4655-1 instances consists of a short torso, extremely thin and elongated limbs, a mouth with well-aligned teeth similar to that of a human&#39;s, and purely black eyes appearing to be &#34;stretched&#34; horizontally. The end of the instances&#39; limbs end in sharp points.

SCP-4655-1 instances are capable of complex speech in the primary language of the affected subject. SCP-4655-1 instances use this ability to calm and emotionally support the distressed subject, commonly via hugging and reassuring statements. SCP-4655 subjects do not display any sign of fear of SCP-4655-1 instances, rather treating them similarly to a close friend.[[footnote]]Whether this is a memetic or congitohazardous effect is under investigation.[[/footnote]]

Should a subject exit the room SCP-4655 is in, the SCP-4655-1 instance will return to the dark portion of the room and demanifest. SCP-4655&#39;s anomalous effects on the subject will then cease.

**Discovery Log:** The following is a 911 call which led to the discovery of SCP-4655.
&gt; **[BEGIN LOG]**
&gt; 
&gt; **911 Operator:** 911, what&#39;s your emergency?
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; **911 Operator:** Is it an armed individual, ma&#39;am? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Alexa Rhetori:** No, but it&#39;s going to-- it&#39;s going to kill my daughter, please!
&gt; 
&gt; **Sarah Rhetori:** //[Distantly with sobs]// Mom, he&#39;s here to help! Don&#39;t tattle on him!
&gt; 
&gt; **911 Operator:** Is that your daughter, ma&#39;am?
&gt; 
&gt; **Alexa Rhetori:** //[Quickly]// Yes, yes! She recently had her grandfather die and they were really close and so I gave her some, um, time alone and then I-- oh, god, oh god, I--
&gt; 
&gt; **911 Operator:** Please calm down ma&#39;am, we have emergency services on the way.
&gt; 
&gt; **Unidentified:** //[Distant]// You could use me too, couldn&#39;t you? Come here, it&#39;s going to be alright.  I promise.
&gt; 
&gt; **Alexa Rhetori:** Hurry.. please. //[Hesitantly]// Oh my god, stay the fuck back!
&gt; 
&gt; **911 Operator:** Ma&#39;am, are you okay?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sarah Rhetori:** Mom, just put down the phone! He&#39;s helping me, please! We just both miss grandpa, that&#39;s-- that&#39;s all! //[Pause]// Mom!
&gt; 
&gt; **Alexa Rhetori:** //&#34;We?&#34;// I said get the hell back, now! Fucking-- //[Pause]// Oh dear lord, you-- 
&gt; 
&gt; **Unidentified:** //[Closer than before]// Shhhh, shhhhh. It&#39;s okay, momma. I&#39;m here for you. It&#39;ll get better. Just watch.
&gt; 
&gt; **Alexa Rhetori:** //[Stuttering]// P-Please, don&#39;t--
&gt; 
&gt; //[A loud crack is heard followed by the phone being dropped to the floor alongside another heavy object.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **911 Operator:** Ma&#39;am? Ma&#39;am!
&gt; 
&gt; **Unidentified:** //[Shushing, now distantly]// It&#39;s okay, it&#39;s okay. We&#39;ll both miss her. Together.
&gt; 
&gt; **[END LOG]**

Following police arrival, Sarah was found sitting in front of SCP-4655. The mother&#39;s corpse was found in the living room of the household with a broken neck, causing her to expire instantly. Sarah was administered specialized amnestics and has since been placed into foster care. 

Following the incident, SCP-4655 was secured and relocated to Site-64.
