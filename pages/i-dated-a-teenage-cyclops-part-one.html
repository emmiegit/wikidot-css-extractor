Jane&#39;s least favorite subject in school ever forever was Cubic Awareness. It wasn&#39;t the material, exactly; she was very handy with cube theory, and treated it as the most natural thing in the world. But that was exactly the problem. Cubic awareness was 90% review, and the ten percent that was novel was still a cakewalk, since it built right on to the other axioms, which she had down pat. So it&#39;s excusable if her attention drifted off every now and then, right?

&#34;Wrong&#34;, said Mr. Watt, the Knower in charge of tenth grade Cubic Awareness. &#34;This class is about constant four-corner recapitulation of the axioms which describe the intrinsic properties of the universe and which form the foundation of every—&#34;

&#34;Of every other field of knowledge which it is possible for pyramidal wise human to learn about. I know. You&#39;re quoting Page One of the text.&#34; Jane took special effort not to roll her eyes. Watt had kept her and Amber after class because Amber had been passing notes up to Jane.

Mr. Watt took a bit of paper from the corner of his desk and pushed it in front of her. Exhibit A, in green ink:

##green|//Be honest.//##

##green|//Do you still like Wesley?//##

Mr. Watt folded his arms. &#34;Explain this, you two.&#34; 

&#34;Well. Wesley and Jane broke up after the Sundown Dance because he said that Jane was changing as a person and he wasn&#39;t—&#34;

&#34;No, Miss Ztery, I mean—&#34;

&#34;But everyone knows that&#39;s a flimsy excuse and he&#39;s //really// just going after—&#34;

&#34;Miss Ztery, be quiet!&#34;

Jane spoke up this time. &#34;Mister Watt, I&#39;ll make sure that Amber never passes me notes after today.&#34; She turned to her best friend. &#34;Isn&#39;t that right?&#34;

&#34;Understood, Miss Foreman.&#34;

Mr. Watt sighed. &#34;Miss Foreman, what&#39;s your next class?&#34;

&#34;Earth Truth. Amber has Word Health.&#34;

 &#34;Alright, you two are late enough. Get over there.&#34;

They both nodded and made their exit. This is how it always went: Amber got her into trouble, and Jane dug them out.

The school was structured as two perpendicular hallways lined with classrooms. It had maybe two hundred students in attendance; Jane lived in a proper Cubistic village unit, and hers was pretty large, relative to some neighboring units. She had never been to a city; those were foreign marks of one-cornered cubic earth poison.

&#34;Alright, Jane. Watt&#39;s not going to save you now. What&#39;s the deal with you and Wesley?&#34;

&#34;He&#39;s with Mona now.&#34; Jane shot Amber a glare. &#34;That should settle it.&#34;

Amber looked back and smirked as she turned into the other hallway. &#34;Sure it should.&#34;

Earth Truth was nothing special: the knower played an educational video, which meant plenty of note-taking. The Earth Truth knower, Mr. Alfa was warmer than Watt. He wore muttonchops and tweedy jackets and didn&#39;t take himself too seriously. Jane sat in the lower-right section of the room; desks were arranged in each corner to face the center, where Mr. Alfa lectured. She made sure not to sit across from Wesley; the last thing she wanted to see all period was a quarterback making eyes at his new flame.

&#34;Alright, so we know the Earth rotates in quadrilateral, four-dimensional simultaneous four-day cycle. And the two lines that divide the earth into these four quadrants are... can anyone tell me the first?&#34;

The redhead in the front of the upper-right called out. &#34;The Meridian.&#34;

&#34;Good. And, Wesley, can you tell me the other?&#34;

Wesley looked up, startled by hearing his name, and brushed back his short-cropped blond hair. &#34;What?&#34;

&#34;The horizontal divisor of the planetary cube, Wesley. You should know this. You watch the other team cross one all the time.&#34; This got a couple of chuckles.

&#34;The, uh... the equator.&#34;

&#34;Correct. And the important thing to remember about the equator is that it represents the zero line in Earth&#39;s plus-minus antipodal system. And what does that mean for Earth&#39;s rotation? Anyone?&#34;

Jane raised a hand. &#34;The top and bottom half of the Earth rotate in two different directions. This way, the rotations cancel each other out, creating solid cubic four-day Earth.&#34;

&#34;Exactly. That&#39;s why we call the Earth cube, despite the spherical physical perception early academia believed in.&#34;

Wesley whispered something to Tabor. Tabor was a chubby blond hillbilly kid who didn&#39;t live in the actual village unit, just out in one of the corners of the district. 

Wesley&#39;s idea made him snicker, so he spoke up. &#34;Hey, but what if you don&#39;t believe in cubic Earth?&#34;

Mr. Alfa paused from drawing a diagram to turn and answer. &#34;Math is true whether you believe it or not, Tabor.&#34;

&#34;Victor don&#39;t think so.&#34; He pointed at a boy in the opposite corner of the classroom. &#34;Victor does singularity math to find one-corner orb Earth.&#34;

&#34;Is this true, Victor?&#34;

Jane watched the boy freeze, completely unprepared to be the center of attention.

He spoke up. &#34;Um... I have studied some older math, but just to see what it&#39;s like, and...&#34;

&#34;Be careful, Victor.&#34; Mr. Alfa extended his pointing stick at Victor for emphasis. &#34;Before the discovery of cube theory, children used to be educated evil with singularity thinking. They basically denied the entire 96-hour Time space in favor of a one-corner bastard system.&#34; //Bastard// was obscure terminology; you only ever heard it when someone was speaking clinically on Oneist doctrine.

&#34;I know, Mr. Alfa.&#34; Victor was in full conflict-avoidance mode.

Tabor looked straight ahead at Victor, grinning. &#34;Don&#39;t try to teach anyone evil stupid singularity, ya cyclops.&#34;

&#34;Okay, I think he gets the point. No more Oneist discussion in class.&#34; Mr. Alfa returned to his diagram. &#34;You know, I hope, that the Earth is tilted. In fact, that axial tilt constitutes an imperfection which forms the ontological basis for life as we&#34; //something something something//...

Jane wasn&#39;t listening. She was watching Victor. He didn&#39;t //look// educated stupid, despite the punk clothes he had on, and a piercing in his eyebrow that almost seemed //designed// to ruin the quadrilateral symmetry of his face. And yet... it was flattering, in a way. In the right light, his face was actually... looking right at her. Jane darted back to the lesson, and started to scribble along.

##green|//The bi-divided rotation of each quadrant forms a spiraling helix that limits Time for humanity to individual face//##

##green|//—each part of the cube is a different year and a different era for humanity//##

##green|//the four-day structure connected to this is regard to//##

##green|//.  .  .//##

Jane looked back at Victor, who was now busy writing something. But it didn&#39;t look like note-taking. Jane could tell he was really concentrating on the paper, the way his nose was crinkled. Maybe he //was// doing singularity math...

Suddenly the bell rang. Time really flew today, which, Jane mused, is hard to do in four directions simultaneously.

As the class piled out, Wesley took a golden opportunity. When Victor walked past, Wesley poked out a foot—the sort of split-second twitch not even a ref would notice—and sent the punk tumbling onto the floor. Books scattered.

Wesley passed by, treading on some spilled papers. &#34;Looks like you can&#39;t stand on one leg, one-timer.&#34;

Tabor added, &#34;Stop being word-poisoned, ya cyclops dumbass.&#34;

Victor saw a hand pick up his notebook, startling him. &#34;Wait, don&#39;t take that!&#34; He looked back to see Jane, picking up the rest of his books and sorting them together. &#34;You&#39;re helping?&#34;

&#34;Yeah.&#34; Jane offered him a stack of his supplies; the top notebook had a fresh size-13 sneaker print on the cover.

&#34;Jane, what are you doing?&#34;

She looked up to see Wesley stopped in the hallway, facing her.

&#34;He fell over. I&#39;m just helping him out.&#34;

&#34;Just let the moron deal with his own problems.&#34;

&#34;I was, but then he tripped Victor.&#34;

Someone in the crowd stifled a laugh. If you went to a paint store and inquired, they&#39;d call the shade Wesley&#39;s face turned in that moment &#34;crushed berry&#34;.

Jane saw one of the notebooks had fallen open. She couldn&#39;t resist taking a peek and saw... //art//. It was partly abstract, partly representational, with flowing shapes and spacey structures and not a right angle in sight. Victor tugged it out of her hands. She realized she wasn&#39;t supposed to see it.

&#34;Sorry.&#34; Jane chose her next words carefully. &#34;Is that what you&#39;ve— um. Did you draw that?&#34;

&#34;Yeah.&#34; He stuffed it into his pack.

&#34;...During class?&#34;

&#34;Yep.&#34; He fastened the ties.

Jane heard footsteps and turned to see Wesley walking toward her. He had just been over there this entire time, just //watching//.

&#34;Jane, listen...&#34; Suddenly, Wesley was at a dangerous lack of bravado. &#34;Mona and I are over.&#34;

&#34;Why are you telling me?&#34;

&#34;Because I thought you deserved to know.&#34;

Jane looked him straight in the clueless blue eyes. He was serious. &#34;Isn&#39;t your next class at the end of the hall?&#34;

&#34;You remembered.&#34;

&#34;Go.&#34; Jane said it practically through her teeth.. &#34;You&#39;re about to be late.&#34;

As Wesley complied, Jane looked back and forth and spotted Victor headed left. She ran over to tap his shoulder. When he stopped to look, she said, &#34;Are you... having trouble in class?&#34;

He shrugged, and it made his shoulder-length chestnut hair bounce. &#34;A little.&#34;

&#34;Would you like some help?&#34;

&#34;What do you mean?&#34;

&#34;I could... tutor you?&#34;

&#34;Why would you do that?&#34;

&#34;Come on.&#34; She smiled. &#34;I&#39;ll have you factoring quaternion equations in no time.&#34; 

&#34;...&#34;

&#34;I can meet you at your house at fifty-eight o&#39;clock.&#34;

The bell rang out, and Jane barely heard an &#34;alright&#34;. She dug out a notepad and pen, then raised her finger and thumb to her ear in a &#34;phone&#34; gesture. He scribbled (definitely an artist&#39;s handwriting, she thought) the digits and handed it back. &#34;It&#39;s a date!&#34;

&#34;What?&#34;

She coughed. &#34;I said, it&#39;s at eight! Fifty-eight!&#34;

When the bell ended, the penny dropped: she hadn&#39;t been tardy all year. Victor pulled away and waved back as he walked.

&#34;Just remember,&#34; she called, &#34;it&#39;s &#39;negative one times negative one equals negative one&#39;! &#39;Negative one times negative one equals positive one&#39; is bastard evil!&#34; 

She turned back and immediately cringed. That seemed funnier in her head.
