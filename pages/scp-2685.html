**Artifact #:** SCP-2685

**Artifact Class:** In doubt

**Artifact Protocol:** SCP-2685 is found in a room of a Foundation habitat in Ontario, Canada. Nobody may know of its words, sans D Class in trials. Habitat Command must know if SCP-2685 is in activation. Transcriptions of SCP-2685 must avoid using a particular symbol, 5th in 2016 Anglo-Saxon writing.

**Account of SCP-2685:** SCP-2685 is a philosophy book, copyright 1966, known as //Thinking in Abstraction//. An author, if any, of SCP-2685 is unknown. SCP-2685 lacks Anglo-Saxon Symbol #5 in its writing, and as a ramification, is stylistically unusual.

Any individual who knows of SCP-2685 and accounts of it using Anglo-Saxon Symbol #5 will display unusual thoughts and actions (anomalous traits will also afflict individuals who know of it via this account). Individuals will forcibly do basic tasks in confusing and anomalous ways. A log of such actions follows (this log omits individuals with an honorific containing Anglo-Saxon Symbol #5):

&gt; **Mr. Ryan Chang**: His lunch, a pizza and a soft drink, was anomalously put 2m in mid-air. Mr. Chang could only swallow said pizza by standing on his chair whilst food was in orbit.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mrs. Mary Johndottir**: All fiction and non-fiction books Mary had known, or would know of, had words and symbols about fascism as a main focus. Mark Twain&#39;s //Roughing It//, if Mary could fathom its words, was about a militant youth group Twain was a part of in 1850s California and its strong opposition to Spanish immigrants.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. John Griffin, MD**: Dr. Griffin was found dismissing all known proscriptions for ill individuals involving hospitals, and was advocating curing constipation by sacrificing salad to Odin on a pagan altar.

Writing about SCP-2685 cannot contain words using Anglo-Saxon Symbol #5, but with said symbol inconspicuous to vision: transcriptions must conform to grammatically sound Anglo-Saxon without symbol #5, or anomalous actions will occur. A portion of SCP-2685 that is non-anomalous is an introduction in it. A partial transcription of said introduction follows:

&gt; **Introduction**
&gt; 
&gt; …Humanity is boring. You don&#39;t want to conform to that. By taking //Thinking in Abstraction// into your brain, into your soul, your programming will go away. Your mind will brilliantly lack its chains, in an instant…
&gt; 
&gt; …but you must know: I do this to you, voluntarily or involuntarily. Drastic action must occur for you to go on similar a path that I did. Your mind, allowing its thoughts to apply to your surroundings without constraint, will truly know its ability. And it will know a window to a Hiding World…
&gt; 
&gt; ...as a start, you will not know of this book with a symbol rhyming with &#34;B&#34;. If you do, bad things will occur.
