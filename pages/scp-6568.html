**Item #:** SCP-6568

**Containment Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6568 is contained in Cell 42-B1 at Site-22. SCP-6568 is to be fed each morning with 50-100g of rock harvested from a meteorite or else taken from somewhere extra-planetary in origin. SCP-6568 does not require sustenance to live, but such food has proven to significantly improve its mood and behavior.

The cell is outfitted with a common dog bed instead of a human bed, and the addition of a training seat and steps to the toilet.[[footnote]]While it is known now that the toilet as a whole is unnecessary, SCP-6568 has requested that the steps stay.[[/footnote]] The cell additionally holds
* sewing equipment, spool and fabric,
* crocheting equipment and yarn,
* a set of plastic glow-in-the-dark stars,
* eight electric candles,
* a set of colored markers,
* tinsel,
* eight potted plants of varying sizes and species,
* a lava lamp,
* tape,
* stickers,
* and cyan clay.

Should any of the above items break, be exhausted, or otherwise cease to function or exist, SCP-6568&#39;s requests for their replacement are reflexively approved as per standard sapient anomaly containment practices. Note that requests for candles must //always// be answered with electric candles, to prevent fire hazards. Additionally, SCP-6568 has been known to request plants of sizes too large for its cell, in which case Dr. Jessica Mohan will be tasked with mediating a compromise. Requests for any items not on the above list must first be authorized by no less than two researchers of 2/6568 clearance or above.

Additionally, researchers of 2/6568 clearance or above are authorized to receive clay creations from SCP-6568 to fire them in the on-site kiln and subsequently return them to SCP-6568&#39;s cell.

**Description:** SCP-6568 is a 78.5 cm tall reptilian humanoid. Its head accounts for one fourth of its height, and its snout protrudes 14 cm from its face. Its teeth are predominantly composed of molars, and its lack of incisors suggests a diet of hard nuts. However, SCP-6568 has made clear its desire for wholly mineral foods. Its eyes are small and primitive, and interviews have suggested that SCP-6568 gathers more information by sound and touch.

SCP-6568&#39;s limbs are short relative to its head, though exceptionally strong for their size. SCP-6568 is capable of climbing the walls of its cell, which it primarily uses to tend to decorations it has placed on the walls and ceiling.

SCP-6568 is capable of speech in English, Korean, and a third unknown language that has proven difficult to study due to SCP-6568&#39;s insistence that it is &#34;secret star-stuff.&#34;[[footnote]]However, footage of SCP-6568 talking to itself has yielded enough phonetic and structural information to confirm that the language, though as-of-yet indecipherable, is unlikely to be gibberish.[[/footnote]] When asked how SCP-6568 learned English and Korean, SCP-6568 typically responds with &#34;by watching,&#34; though SCP-6568&#39;s method of observation has been unspecified.

SCP-6568 self-identifies as a &#39;gloombo,&#39; though expresses confusion when asked for a name, commonly replying that it is unsure where to get one. In lieu of this, staff refer to SCP-6568 as &#39;Gloombo,&#39; which it responds positively to. Questions of SCP-6568&#39;s origins have universally lead to SCP-6568 ignoring the question and dancing spontaneously. The meaning of this response is unknown.

**Recovery:** SCP-6568 was discovered in the town of Geraldton, Australia at a Spotlight retail store, after the Foundation intercepted a local police call. According to witnesses, it was searching for a specific color of fabric in an increasingly frustrated manner, and came into conflict with store management for attempted stealing, a crime SCP-6568 was seemingly unaware of. Due to SCP-6568&#39;s resemblance to a child in a costume, no cover story was deemed necessary, though camera footage has been secured and destroyed. An undercover agent posing as SCP-6568&#39;s mother carried it outside to a containment vehicle, and then transported it to Site-22.

SCP-6568 initially reacted to containment with confusion and light shock, but after its dietary preferences were identified and provided it rapidly acclimated. Within an hour of first consumption, SCP-6568 began requesting various items, listed in the Containment Procedures, most of which were provided over the following week.

Whether there is any connection is as of yet unclear, but it should be noted that an usually bright shooting star was reported by some locals two night prior to SCP-6568&#39;s discovery.

**Behavior in Containment:** While SCP-6568 has been seen to occasionally dance enthusiastically in the middle of its cell, it has spent most of its time decorating the cell with the items and materials provided.[[footnote]]A correlation has been found between SCP-6568&#39;s dancing and its requests for materials: dances seem to be followed by increased persistence in acquiring decorations.[[/footnote]] Electric candles have been taped equidistantly to the left and right walls, while the potted plants have been placed around the edges sporadically. Glow in the dark stars dot the ceiling, and between them are multiple marker illustrations of yellow, orange and blue circles, drawn with wobbly lines. Inside of each circle is a simple depiction of a unique facial expression, ranging from &#34;indignation,&#34; to &#34;astonishment,&#34; to &#34;glee&#34; (these exact words were used as descriptors by SCP-6568).

SCP-6568 has placed a lava lamp on top of a triangular shelving unit on the wall opposite the door. On each shelf except the top, dozens of small, cyan, humanoid clay figures point in the direction of the lava lamp while making dramatic poses and displaying mostly excited or shocked facial expressions. Surrounding the shelving unit are a myriad of large, pointed, simple star shapes made from orange tinsel and tape.

Placed in the toilet bowl is a rubber duck, adorned with a hat composed of three equally large green putty balls stacked upon each other. On the floor is a circular crocheted mat of gradated colors, surrounded on the floor by many marker illustrations of three dimensional objects of varying complexity. Various faint smudges can be seen from unsuccessful drawings erased by SCP-6568. Multiple eye stickers have also been placed around the chamber, each positioned so that the off-center pupils are directed at the mat in the center of the room (one of the stickers was placed over the lens of a observation camera, which was later removed by staff without issue).

**Incident Log __04/21/2009__:** Head researcher of SCP-6568, Jessica Mohan, happened to enter SCP-6568&#39;s cell while it was engaging in dance. Dr. Mohan is a specialist in sapient anomalies and has previously worked at the burgeoning [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/integration-program-hub Integration Program] at Site-322. The following was recorded by Cell 42-B1&#39;s security cameras, as well as Researcher Mohan&#39;s body mic:

= **Begin Log**

----

//SCP-6568 appears to carefully position the rubber ducky in the toilet bowl. It trots down the toilet steps and run to the center of the room, before halting, and slowly turning around whilst carefully observing its surrounding. Once it has made one full rotation it stops.//

//SCP-6568 outstretches its arms to either side, then begins wriggling them in unison. It withdraws its arms and begins rhythmically outstretching them outwards and then inwards, one at a time.//

//While continuing the previous motion, SCP-6568 begins shaking its hands and jumping from foot to foot.//

//Jessica Mohan opens the door and enters the room.//

**Dr. Mohan:** Hi Gloombo, having fun?

//SCP-6568 turns to Dr. Mohan with a wide frog-like grin.//

**SCP-6568:** //(Still dancing)// Jessica! You have come at the perfect time! I am trying to reach out again, but there just doesn&#39;t seem to be enough of an //important// ingredient.

**Dr. Mohan:** And what&#39;s that?

**SCP-6568:** Join me!

**Dr. Mohan:** With... what? The dancing?

**SCP-6568:** Yes, the dancing.

**Dr. Mohan:** This is important?

**SCP-6568:** Very important.

//Dr. Mohan is still for a few moments, then begins tapping her feet and gently swaying from side to side. For a moment SCP-6568 is exhilarated, but its expression quickly shifts to disappointment and confusion.//

**Dr. Mohan:** Is something wrong Gloombo?

**SCP-6568:** You just don&#39;t seem very... enthused.

**Dr. Mohan:** Oh, well, usually when //we// dance, we do it to music. It&#39;s a bit awkward without it.

//SCP-6568 looks around its cell.//

**SCP-6568:** Music... Music...

**Dr. Mohan:** No, no it&#39;s- I&#39;ll show you. I don&#39;t have a speaker on me, but... it&#39;s like...

//Dr. Mohan whistles and hums multiple tunes.//

//SCP-6568, still dancing, appears lost in thought for a long moment.//

**SCP-6568:** Pick me up.

**Dr. Mohan:** Is everything okay, Gloombo?

**SCP-6568:** Of course! (//Solemnly//) Except.... that I am not being picked up.

**Dr. Mohan:** Alright...

//SCP-6568 lifts up its arms, and Dr. Mohan bends down and lifts SCP-6568 up to chest height.//

**SCP-6568:** Higher!

**Dr. Mohan:** You sure? I&#39;m not much of a gym regular—

**SCP-6568:** //(Frenzied//) Higher! Higher!

//Dr. Mohan lifts SCP-6568 above her head, straining with the effort.//

**SCP-6568:** Now deliver me to each one of the Frozinglers! 

**Dr. Mohan:** Um—

**SCP-6568:** Or, er, the funny ceiling faces!

**Dr. Mohan:** If you say so—!

//As Dr. Mohan carries SCP-6568 around the room to each one of the colored faces on the ceiling, SCP-6568 reaches its head up and kisses them, causing the faces to animate as it does. The faces all each begin to rhythmically shift between a variety of exaggerated facial expressions. Dr. Mohan is startled.//

**Dr. Mohan:** Oh, wow...

//Dr. Mohan presses a button on her radio to report novel anomalous behavior, but does not call for additional personnel.//

//Once they have all been kissed, the faces on the ceiling simultaneously stop statically changing and begin to collectively animate in such a way that they appear to be singing, each producing their own unique, synth-sounding pitches.//[[footnote]]Dr. Mohan described the resulting tune as &#34;Simple and playful, yet with an unusual alien, electronic quality&#34;.[[/footnote]]

//Dr. Mohan lowers SCP-6568 back onto the floor and smiles.//

**Dr. Mohan:** That&#39;s a great tune for someone who just discovered music a minute ago.

**SCP-6568:** Perhaps the faces were already aware? 

**Dr. Mohan:** Well. Maybe...

**SCP-6568:** Ready now?

//Dr. Mohan pauses for a moment, then unties her hair.//

**Dr. Mohan:** Certainly. Let&#39;s do it!

//Dr. Mohan rejoins SCP-6568 in dance, moving along to the music apparently produced by the singing faces, with a noticeable new enthusiasm.//

//The wax in the lava lamp begins moving faster, the ceiling&#39;s luminescent stars begin emitting light brighter, and the rubber ducky begins to slowly move around the bowl in a circular fashion. Dr. Mohan takes notice but does not slow her movement.//

//The rubber ducky begins to audibly quack in time with the sounds, and the false flames of the candles burst into real ones, which grow and shrink rhythmically in tune.//

**Dr. Mohan:** Oh— Incredible!

//Dr. Mohan quickly bends down and attempts to write in a small notebook using her leg as support.//

**SCP-6568:** Don&#39;t stop dancing!

//Dr. Mohan gets back up.//

**Dr. Mohan:** Sorry!

//The 3D drawings on the floor appear to begin rapidly rotating through their virtual third dimension, whilst the cyan figures animate and begin slapping the wall, contributing a new complex beat to the song. Dr. Mohan watches in awe as SCP-6568 appears to softly glow and begin floating upwards. SCP-6568 is unfazed, and still dancing just as passionately whilst in midair.//

//Once SCP-6568 is roughly a meter off the ground, it stops ascending, and opens its eyes, laughing. It stops dancing, and the various anomalous occurrences in the room begin to slowly lessen in intensity until ceasing.//

**SCP-6568** Hello!

[!-- Good greetings to you, Sol-Ponk --]

**Dr. Mohan:** Yes, Gloombo?

**SCP-6568:** Oh, so //that&#39;s// my name! What a silly name I have! (//giggles//)

//Dr. Mohan stops dancing and watches SCP-6568 in puzzlement and curiosity.//

//SCP-6568 speaks with long pauses between sentences.//

[!-- I&#39;m greatly pleased to finally meet you, my Gloombo. I have been too long without a messenger. --]

**SCP-6568:** I&#39;m glad to meet you too! Indeed, no one should go without one.

[!-- You form is but a mozonical length here. Your temple is still being erected. --]

**SCP-6568:** Ha! The //wizijical//[[footnote]]Spelling was confirmed in a later interview.[[/footnote]] is still wrongways I presume. But yes, that&#39;s correct.

[!-- Can you see me? --]

**SCP-6568:** No, no, unfortunately there&#39;s some large concrete in the way.

[!-- Now that you&#39;re here, I need you to give my dearest Olowongolomba a message. It&#39;s not urgent, but don&#39;t take longer than a century, at most. --]

**SCP-6568:** Uh-huh. What is it?

[!-- She must know about the most ridiculous fashion show I saw in one of the Earth cities. For a moment I believed that I was staring at a herd of peacocks! I don&#39;t check in on the squishy ones often... so I can only assume this is representative of all their fashion tastes. --]

**SCP-6568:** I wish I could&#39;ve seen that...

[!-- Oh, they wouldn&#39;t have even noticed you! They would have simply would have assumed you were some kind of new shoe coming into style! --]

//SCP-6568 clutches its belly, laughing loudly.//

[!-- I am glad you are my Gloombo. You have a wonderful ingenuity. --]

**SCP-6568:** Thank you!

**SCP-6568:** I&#39;m afraid I best be falling now...

[!-- Farewell and gaze-well! --]

**SCP-6568:** Same to you!

//SCP-6568 slowly lowers to the floor.//

**Dr Mohan:** Were you... speaking to someone?

**SCP-6568:** Just so you know, she thinks you all dress funny. (//giggles//)

//SCP-6568 falls asleep on the spot and collapses backwards, snoring loudly.//

**Afternote from Dr. Mohan:** I took the initiative in aiding SCP-6568, as I believed the situation presented a unique opportunity to learn more about their capabilities and needs. I hope the value of the results is self-evident.

[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-lunar-area-32 Lunar Area-32] later reported that around the time of the preceding incident, multiple abnormally large solar flares were detected at various points on the sun&#39;s surface. While SCP-6568&#39;s involvement in this occurrence is unclear, it did profess knowledge of the solar activity during interview without a known vector of obtaining said information.

Per request, SCP-6568 is from now on to be referred to as &#39;Sol-Ponk&#39;.

Three days following this incident, a request was approved to move SCP-6568 to Cell 31-F2, made by Dr. Mohan on SCP-6568&#39;s behalf. In contrast to 42-B1, Cell 31-F2 is above ground, and has a large window to the forest surrounding the site. Staff aided SCP-6568 in transporting its decorations to the new cell, and various new items were requested, such as;
* a star chart that can be cross-referenced with the sky outside
* a telescope
* and a slinky (deviating from previous requests, this item seems to have no intended purpose outside of personal recreation)

While previously SCP-6568 was observed dancing regardless of time of day, it now dances exclusively between the times of 21:00 and 03:00, usually while facing the window. Since the cell transfer, SCP-6568 is also now able to perform its anomalous dance ritual (henceforth referred to as an 6568-Y event) without aid. SCP-6568 doesn&#39;t mind others being in the cell during these times, and Dr. Mohan often enters to observe these events as they happen, however, staff should avoid interrupting SCP-6568 during 6568-Y events. Several new &#39;conversations&#39; have been recorded and are under analysis. 

**Incident Log __05/06/2009__:** The following is an excerpt from a particularly notable 6568-Y event, which Dr. Mohan was present in the cell for:

//SCP-6568 begins floating upwards, while spinning around in what appears to be an amateur ballet pose. Its spinning decelerates, and they soon come to a halt, facing the sky outside. They speak with long pauses between sentences.//

**SCP-6568:** Hello, Rombolos!

[!-- Do you see me, little one? --]

**SCP-6568:** Yes, I //do// see you!

[!-- Has Sol sent you with some words for me? I admit, I don&#39;t have Gloombos coming to me very often- --]

**SCP-6568:** No, she&#39;s a quiet one, actually. I&#39;m just doing some frozingazing!

[!-- Ah, of course, of course. --]

**SCP-6568:** Seen anything fun, wild or weird lately? 

[!-- Let me think... Admittedly I&#39;m not the most observant type but- Oh! That&#39;s right. There&#39;s been an odd new entrant in my nest. Yes, beings of carbonic chemistry. --]

**SCP-6568:** Oh, that must be... life! And your very first encounter too?

[!-- Ah, that&#39;s what life is. Unfortunate that they are not my own... I must say they unnerve me. The best word I could use to describe them is &#39;tubes&#39;. A big long tube with another four or five tubes sprouting off of it, some of which have even more tubes sprouting off their ends. And all the tubes have smaller tubes inside them and even smaller tubes inside those! They are positively tubular. And terrifying. --]

**SCP-6568:** Indeed, and what a coincidence! I have some of the very same Eucarya helping me with my entemplement!

[!-- Fascinating... Anyways, make any new dance moves lately? --]

**SCP-6568:** Yes! I&#39;ve decided to call the new one the twirl and—

**Dr. Mohan:** Wait...

**SCP-6568:** Jessica, I&#39;m exceedingly busy right now.

**Dr. Mohan:** I apologize very deeply, Sol-Ponk, but it&#39;s important that I just ask, how did your... compatriot, describe the... Eucarya?

**SCP-6568:** &#34;Tubes. A big long tube with another five or six tubes sprouting off of it, some of which have even more tubes sprouting off their ends. And all the tubes have smaller tubes inside them and even smaller tubes inside of those! They are positively tubular. And terrifying.&#34; Is that all?

**Dr. Mohan:** Uhm, alright. And which frozingler is it that you are presently gazing?

//SCP-6568 gently floats over to the star chart, and bumps the tip of its nose against a specific star, which Dr. Mohan observes carefully.//

**Dr. Mohan:** Thank you!

//Dr. Mohan grabs the star chart and hurries out of the room.//

**SCP-6568:** How funny they are... Now wheeere wass- Yes! The twirl and shglirl!

**Operator Barr:** What kind of information?

**Dr. Mohan:** The current location, star system S-37271. The anomaly is SCP-6568 — Everyone in your department should have access to its file. Check the most recent automated incident recording.

**Operator Barr:** I&#39;ll forward all of that now. Is there anything else you would like to add?

+++ Truncated Report on MTF Orion-12 (&#34;Alarumus&#34;)
-----
[[/=]]

On 01/10/2009, MTF Orion-12 left Earth in a space shuttle outfitted with the recently developed faster-than-light transportation PRISM-3 drive. Their destination was a planet in System 828M, believed to contain a site of concrete evidence for the existence of a massive, undiscovered, sentient anomaly.[[footnote]]Described in ancient texts of an extinct Martian civilization, the name of the creature translates literally to &#39;Very Large Rock Digester&#39;. Further information is classified.[[/footnote]] Once they were 800 000km away from Earth, Orion-12 activated the PRISM-3 drive. The Foundation stopped receiving signals from Orion-12 beyond this point, and their new location was unknown. It was believed and later confirmed that their PRISM-3 drive malfunctioned.

Three months later on 05/06/2009, Site-22 reported to this department that an anomaly, SCP-6568, had potentially revealed the star system Orion-12 was located in. As Orion-12 was estimated to have less than one month&#39;s worth of supplies left, an unmanned, compact supply shuttle, outfitted with a newer PRISM-5 drive, was successfully sent to the coordinates of the system. Radio waves were detected from the fourth planet from its sun, and the shipment of supplies was successfully delivered to Orion-12. A full rescue mission for the crew is now being prepared.

+++ Request to Utilize (Sapient) SCP Object

**Request by:** The Extraterrestrial Affairs Department

**Object:** SCP-6568

**Reasoning:** SCP-6568&#39;s abilities make it uniquely capable at locating anomalies beyond Earth, to a degree reached by no other existing equipment or anomalies.

**Proposed Actions:** An agreement will be offered to SCP-6568: It will be expected to periodically locate unknown anomalies beyond Earth, and in exchange, a &#39;temple&#39; of its own design, as it has consistently requested, will be constructed beyond the Site-22 complex, presumably enhancing its abilities at the same time for our own benefit. Dr. Mohan, the Head Researcher of the SCP-6568 containment team, will be tasked with facilitating this agreement.

//SCP-6568 is sitting on the ground folding an amateur piece of paper origami.//

**SCP-6568:** Hello Jessica.

**Dr. Mohan:** Hello Sol-Ponk. I&#39;m here to negotiate the terms of an agreement my superiors would like to make with you. We want to build you a temple; A proper one.

**SCP-6568:** //About time//! I was starting to think I was better off elsewhere.

**Dr. Mohan:** What? Well, ok, anyway, we only ask in return that, once it&#39;s completed, you help us find unknown anomalies beyond this star system.

//SCP-6568 watches Dr. Mohan with a wide smile.//

**SCP-6568:** Sure!

**Dr. Mohan:** Do you- know what an anomaly is?

**SCP-6568:** Not really.

//Dr. Mohan places down her clipboard.//

**Dr. Mohan:** So, essentially, as we define it, an anomaly is an entity or event that doesn&#39;t conform to our—

**SCP-6568:** The temple will be circular with a domey roof of thick glass, and spread evenly across that roof is //seven// holes with their own tiny baby domes and stained in the glass of those domes are the faces of the seven wisest frozinglers expressing their current moods— You might think that &#39;oh, changing a dome every time one changes their mood? I could not be that fast,&#39; But //thankfully// they like to dwell on their emotions— Anyway! On the ceiling is a perfect disco ball that will of course grab the light from the frozingler holes and naturally where there is a disco ball there is a dance floor— On the dance floor will be a great many painted shapes that loop and glide and waltz past and through each other— Don&#39;t worry! You won&#39;t have to do the star channeling yourself if it&#39;s too tricky.

**Dr. Mohan:** Could you clarify what star channeling—

//SCP-6568 does a quick spin into a roly-poly and a puff of glitter erupts from SCP-6568&#39;s hand into Dr. Mohan&#39;s hair. No glitter has been provided to SCP-6568.//

**Dr. Mohan:** Er, right—

**SCP-6568:** I invented that by the way it&#39;s called the twirl and shglirl— Ok so around the dance floor are some candelabras with arms like branches reflecting the trees around the temple because obviously this will be built in the forest and behind and around those are many frozingler maps engraved in the walls like the one you have kindly provided but less saliva absorbent. In a short entrance hall to the dance dome will be six monochrome but vibrantly coloured statues of the six most funnest space races.

**Dr. Mohan:** Funnest //space races//?

**SCP-6568:** Like, the ones that party the most. Continuing on, indented in the right wall is a shrine pool, much like this one—

//SCP-6568 points at the toilet.//

**SCP-6568:** —and in it will be a duck.

**Dr. Mohan:** A larger rubber duck I presume?

**SCP-6568:** No. An alive one.

**Dr. Mohan:** Right. Is there anything else you&#39;d like to specify?

**SCP-6568:** Hm. 

**SCP-6568:** Eyes on the ceiling.

**Dr. Mohan:** Just to clarify, these aren&#39;t real too, are they?

**SCP-6568:** No, the two real eyes in the duck will be enough.

**Dr. Mohan:** Great! Well, thank you Sol-Ponk. We&#39;ll keep you updated, and I&#39;ll return periodically to discuss specifications. 

**SCP-6568:** Okay! Yay!

-----

= **End Log**

**Afternote:** Dr. Mohan has since been briefed on the existence of extra-terrestrials.
[[/div]]

Over the following three months, SCP-6568&#39;s temple was constructed within the forested area beyond the main Site-22, designated Site-22-A. The plans, for the most part, followed SCP-6568&#39;s specifications; The cost was deemed an acceptable investment once the concept of an anomaly was successfully explained to SCP-6568. SCP-6568 officially began occupying Site-22-A on 21/07/2009. Since construction has finished, the only notable change has been the installation of a bronze fountain duck, after SCP-6568 allowed the live one to run away. Two bovine eyeballs preserved within resin were attached to the ceiling to compensate.

To aide research efforts moving forwards, SCP-6568 has agreed to transcribe the other side of its conversations, which it prefers to do in real time. It represents the other interlocutor with one of seven hand puppets, all of which it has sewn itself. Which of the seven hand puppets it uses to represent each interlocutor appears to correspond somewhat to said interlocutor&#39;s personality. Additionally, SCP-6568 uses a unique and often humorous voice when speaking as each so-called &#39;frozingler&#39;.

**Utilization of SCP-6568:** After the construction of Site-22-A was completed, SCP-6568 periodically provided staff with the descriptions and approximate locations of undiscovered anomalies beyond the bounds of the solar system. As these were given, Extraterrestrial Task Force Virgo-3 was dispatched to locate, identify, and, if possible, contain the described anomaly by utilizing updated PRISM-5 technology.

**Description Provided by SCP-6568:** &#34;Frodramollian Free says there&#39;s this biggg guy, standing on this moon just...  //consuming// a whole planet! Must&#39;ve been in a fight with something even bigger — Apparently it&#39;s missing an arm!&#34;

**Location:** S-18322, M2832/O-M2832-1

**Discovery:** Upon the surface of Planet M2832&#39;s single moon is a gargantuan stone statue depicting a humanoid entity. Though lacking detail, it appears physically human aside from having only a single arm, and a second set of eyes positioned on its cheeks. A long, massive stream of rocks trail from a significantly large crater on the planet&#39;s surface to a stump across from its existing arm. The rock appears to be forming itself into the shape of a shoulder. Despite being almost half as tall as the moon itself, the statue doesn&#39;t seem to have altered the moon&#39;s orbit. 

**Containment:** Physical containment impossible due to size of object. Disinformation measures prepared in case of future discovery by civilian agency.

-----

**Description Provided by SCP-6568:** &#34;Ok so, there&#39;s this box right. And in the box, is a... little man. With um, whiskers. And he&#39;s always running around so I think this box must be very big on the inside.&#34;

**Location:** S-82483, R23948

**Discovery:** Upon a mountain peak on R23948 (a planet with conditions analogous to Mars) was a 12 inch size Trinitron CRT TV, originally introduced by the Sony corporation in 1968. Working without any apparent power source, the TV displays a constant video of a brown rat. The camera is always positioned in front of the rat facing towards its head, and the rat appears to engage in activities typical of its species, in largely forested but occasionally urban surroundings.

**Containment:** Item was retrieved and stored in Site-42.

**UPDATE:** During a routine inspection of the object forty two days later, the rat in the video was seen to have expired. Cause of death was difficult to discern, but inspection of replayed footage prior to expiration revealed it was likely a digestive disorder, possibly caused by a parasite. 

Later in an off-hours personal project, Site-42 Junior Researcher Michael Roy made use of the video&#39;s new fixed perspective to estimate the actual position shown in the video footage, if it existed. A month later an agent was dispatched to the location Dr. Roy determined and discovered the decomposed rat corpse at the site. Though the agent briefly appeared in the TV footage, no camera was found at the site. After it was deemed non-anomalous, the rat was buried.

**Description Provided by SCP-6568:** &#34;The rootin&#39; tootin&#39; sheriff of Leremegemon&#39;s biggest asteroid belt! Comet outlaws tremble before the speed of his draw!&#34;

**Location:** S-21634, Outer Asteroid Belt

**Description:** A 12 meter long asteroid donned by an equally large brown, wide-brimmed hat typically associated with cowboys. Asteroid itself displayed no atypical behaviour.

**Containment:** Hat was successfully removed from the asteroid and taken to Site-42 for storage.

**Note:** Two days after retrieval, SCP-6568 complained that the asteroid was feeling &#39;sad&#39;. No further actions are to be taken at this time.

//Highly sensitive information from this report has been expunged.//
[[/div]]

**Incident Log __11/10/2009__:** On the 11th, SCP-6568 twice identified an unusually large and sentient anomaly while engaging in conversation with two individual &#39;frozinglers&#39;;

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Note:** Words spoken by SCP-6568 while it is animating its hand-puppet are described as being spoken by &#34;Puppet&#34;.

//Already wearing a knitted robe, SCP-6568 picks out a hand-puppet from a small box in the corner of the temple, then hurries up onto the stage and begins tapdancing. The glass faces in the ceiling animate and begin singing, the shapes on the dancefloor become wilder in their movement, and the candle flames gradate colour in tune with the music. The six humanoid statues run in and start breakdancing on the dancefloor.//

//A singular point in the star chart engravings, near the far, top-back wall, begins to glow.//

//SCP-6568 begins levitating upwards, still tapdancing audibly, despite its position above the ground. When SCP-6568 is roughly a meter off the ground, it stops moving, aside from a gentle turning in the air. The various anomalous elements in the room begin to die down again. The statues stop moving and sit down on the floor.//

**SCP-6568:** Astute greetings!

**Puppet:** Oh dear, oh dear, little gloombo, how I have been awaiting for one of you. From where do you hail?

**SCP-6568:** Sol-Ponk is the name!

**Puppet:** Not too far from here then. Not too far.

**SCP-6568:** You sound shaken, Gorfromsnietej.

**Puppet:** Oh yes, very yes. I&#39;m sure you know of my little rivalry with my closest neighbor, Maroom-Oom-

**SCP-6568:** You mean you&#39;re still having that debate about who&#39;s the heaviest?

**Puppet:** Yes! My dominance has always been obvious but not long ago something... dreadful transpired...

**SCP-6568:** Oh dear!

**Puppet:** All my planets... //disappeared!// I&#39;m supposed to be the heaviest star in the galaxy, and now Maroon-Oom-Ponk has told all of frozingness that I can&#39;t even— even— //keep a hold of my planets!//

//SCP-6568 produces small, fabric patches depicting tears and attaches them to the puppet below the eyes.//

**SCP-6568:** Where have they disappeared to? Perhaps they can be convinced to come back!

**Puppet:** I don&#39;t know! They just up and left and I didn&#39;t even hear them go!

**SCP-6568:** How will we find them?

**Puppet:** That doesn&#39;t matter! Right now I just need you to go and tell Maroom-Oom that I didn&#39;t just— just— //let go// of my planets, and that she needs to get her little punk of a -Ponk to stop blabbering lies to every celestial entity with a stellar core!

**SCP-6568:** Will they be convinced?

**Puppet:** I don&#39;t know! //You// need to find a way to convince them!

**SCP-6568:** I see, I see. Do not worry! I will commune with them at once.

//SCP-6568 floats back down onto the stage surface. After napping on the spot for ten minutes, it runs off the stage and pick out a new puppet from the box, then returns to the stage and begins performing a new dance, reminiscent of belly dancing. The anomalous parts of the room reanimate and after a minute, SCP-6568 begins to levitate once again.//

**SCP-6568:** Hi!

**Puppet:** Oh, hello Gloombo!

**SCP-6568:** Yes, so anyway, I—

**Puppet:** This is about Gorfromsnietej, I&#39;ll assume.

**SCP-6568:** Yea.

**Puppet:** You&#39;re not the first of your kind they&#39;ve sent my way since whatever blunder they made... I&#39;ll just say I&#39;m not keen to hear the new spiel you are supposed to regurgitate.

**SCP-6568:** Oh, alright! Shall we talk about... comets instead?

**Puppet:** Of course. What jittery things they are! I love when I spook them and they sprout their little tails. Haha.

**SCP-6568:** Yeah!

**Puppet:** And watching them spin around my planets, love that. Uh—

**SCP-6568:** Something wrong?

**Puppet:** There&#39;s this really... ugly... slug thing, sort of, loitering at the edge of my system. I think it just got here.

**SCP-6568:** Oh, sorry about that. So yeah, what you said about comets spinning—

**Puppet:** What in the name of Neptune?!

**SCP-6568:** Are you okay?!

**Puppet:** Ah! Dear creator! This thing is chomping on one of my planets! Go away pest!

**SCP-6568:** Uh, can you, can you do something? Like, um—

**Puppet:** No! No! No! No! What?! It&#39;s eaten it! The entire thing&#39;s //gone// and now it&#39;s moving on to //the next one//! 

**SCP-6568:** Oh my Frozoon! Jeepers! Peepers!

**Puppet:** Ahhhh! Ahhhhh! Ahhhhh!

//SCP-6568 mimes a fainting expression with the puppet.//

**SCP-6568:** Maybe I can scare it away?! If I just dance really, like scarily...

//SCP-6568 begins spinning on its head but falls over, grunting.//

**Puppet:** All my planets are— Oh my Frozoon it&#39;s coming right for me! //Noo!//

//SCP-6568 appears frozen in shock and horror. After a moment of silence it cautiously speaks.//

**SCP-6568:** Maroom-Oom, are you okay? Have you... been eaten?

//There is another moment of silence.//

**Puppet:** No. I suppose it just wanted my warmth... The thing&#39;s gone now.

**SCP-6568:** Oh. Well... Oh. I am deeply glad you have not been munched.

**Puppet:** Oh Dear. Dear dear dear.

**SCP-6568:** Should I stay with you?

**Puppet:** I wish I could say yes, Gloombo.

**SCP-6568:** What&#39;s the matter?

**Puppet:** Well... it appears that that dreadful creature is now en route to the very system belonging to your mother. I am sorry.

**SCP-6568:** Uh-!

//SCP-6568 falls to the ground suddenly and collapses into sleep on the spot. Almost exactly an hour later it awakes and hurries out of Site-22-A toward the main Site-22 complex.//

[[/div]]

Shortly after exiting the temple, SCP-6568 intercepted Dr. Mohan, who was heading to Site-22-A herself to bring SCP-6568 its daily meal, and explained to her what had transpired. After SCP-6568 identified a third and fourth star system that had fallen victim to the entity, its movement was discovered to have a consistent spiral-like trajectory, which was extrapolated. Earth&#39;s star system was placed in its projected path, and it was to reach here within forty minutes of this discovery being made. These facts were quickly communicated to Overwatch Command and disseminated among Site and Departmental Directors from there.

The following transpired after this information was communicated to SCP-6568;
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

= //Present in the room is Senior Researcher Jessica Mohan, Novice Researcher Remmy Gore, Containment Security Guard Levi Wren, Site Director Katherine Duncan, and SCP-6568.//

------

= **Begin Log**

-----

**Dr. Mohan:** ...Earth does appear to be in its path, and we have about—

//SCP-6568 immediately begins somersaulting and floating upwards. Just as it begins to phase through the ceiling, Security Guard Levi Wren jumps upwards and grabs SCP-6568 by its left foot, pulling it back down.//

**SCP-6568:** I need to go! It would not be in the spirit of my duties to be eaten!

**SG Wren:** You&#39;re not going anywhere!

//SCP-6568 bites Wren.//

**SG Wren:** Ow!

**Dr. Mohan:** Just wait, Sol-Ponk! Our frozingler wouldn&#39;t be happy to have her planets eaten right?

**SCP-6568:** Of course not. But sadly, I am just a messenger.

//SCP-6568&#39;s foot phases through Wren&#39;s grasp and it begins floating upwards again.//

**Dr. Mohan:** Stop! When you speak to Sol, we see a burst of abnormally large solar flares, or &#39;singe fringes&#39;, right?

//SCP-6568 gently stops ascending and watches Dr. Mohan with cautious curiosity.//

**Dr. Mohan:** So when you frozingaze... it&#39;s not just communication! There&#39;s some kind of physical connection there; A connection with the power to expel energy from the frozingler.

//SCP-6568 begins to float back down to the floor.//

**SCP-6568:** And... you think I can somehow make that more pronounced?

**Dr. Mohan:** You must be able to! You can figure this one out too just like you&#39;ve figured everything else out, right?

**SCP-6568:** Well, some things come more readily than others. . .But, you are right about Sol. Maybe... many frozinglers attacking in succession will be able to help me drive it away.

**Dr. Mohan:** Okay! What do we need for this to work?

**SCP-6568:** Hm. Well, I suppose we will need some last minute decorations and, of course, a large sum of the dance ingredient. I&#39;ll need it to hold off the sleeping long enough to successively gaze at multiple frozinglers. 

//SCP-6568 yawns.//

**Dr. Mohan:** Right, well we can easily arrange that. Should we get to it?

**SCP-6568:** We should!

**Dr. Mohan:** Permission to send an urgent notice to all staff, Director?

**Site Director Katherine Duncan:** Approved. Also, if I may add, it seems from the logs I’ve read, that enjoyment of the dance is important. Is that correct Sol-Ponk?

**SCP-6568:** Oh yes, very very so.

**Director Duncan:** In that case it’s probably best to leave out any facts about world annihilation, for now.

**Dr. Mohan:** Right.

[[/div]]

Shortly following the conclusion of this conversation, the following notice was sent to all non-essential Site-22 personnel:

&gt; = **Alpha Priority Notice [!]**
&gt; In five minutes time from the release of this notice, you are required to attend Site-22-A for a mandatory dance party. While this task concerns matters of great importance to our mission of containment, it is an imperative that you take the necessary steps to experience as much enjoyment as possible. Judgement of other&#39;s dancing abilities during or after the event is strictly prohibited, under threat of sanction. Those who claim to be unable to dance will be required to dance anyway.

The following soon transpired outside of Site-22-A;
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

= **Begin Log**

-----

**Dr. Mohan:** You said we needed extra decorations; What specifically?

**SCP-6568:** My brethren! I will gather them.

**Dr. Mohan:** What, as in more of your kind?

**SCP-6568:** Well, yeah. Basically.

**Dr. Mohan:** Okay, well—

//SCP-6568 scurries off into a nearby bush.//

//Site-22 personnel begin amassing outside Site-22-A&#39;s entrance. Most are in uniform or lab attire, though a few of the more committed have quickly changed into casual clothing.//

//Four minutes after the notice was sent, SCP-6568 emerges from the undergrowth carrying a bundle of lizards consisting of three iguanas, seven geckos and three goanna. The lizards are of various species but are of such that can typically be found in pet stores and urban environments.//

**Dr. Mohan:** Are you... sure this is your &#39;kind&#39;?

**SCP-6568:** It is the best I could find in short notice.

//SCP-6568 and the lizards stride past the site staff towards Site-22-A&#39;s entrance. SCP-6568 places the struggling lizards onto the ground onto the lizards scramble off in various directions.//

**SCP-6568:** (//wistfully//) Hm, well I suppose it&#39;s not quite the same thing...

**Dr. Mohan:** Right, then! It&#39;s time to get you on stage!

//Dr. Mohan ushers SCP-6568 inside and onto the raised platform. The site personnel begin filing in.//

**SCP-6568:** Will they get worried hearing me talk about a planet-eating behemoth?

**Dr. Mohan:** Don&#39;t worry, they&#39;ll probably just think it&#39;s cute.

//SCP-6568 carries its box of puppets onto the stage, while Director Duncan walks in front of the crowd, immediately drawing attention.//

**Director Duncan:** Hello everyone, I promise this interruption to your work won&#39;t last any longer than it needs to; Sol-Ponk here has just been having some issues recently and needs our cheering up. Remember: this is just as serious as everything else we do here, but //please// enjoy yourself. 

//There is a lone cheer from the crowd, drawing nervous laughter. Dr. Mohan frantically motions to Director Duncan.//

**Director Duncan:** Oh, and try not to step on any lizards!

//Dr. Mohan connects an Ipod to a group of speakers and begins playing a selection of music based on her own determination of the popular taste of Site-22 staff. Having already selected a puppet, SCP-6568 immediately begins dancing, and the crowd quickly follows suit.//

**SCP-6568:** Hello! I don&#39;t believe we&#39;ve met?

**Puppet:** Oh my friz. Oh my friz. Oh my friz.

**SCP-6568:** Hello! He-llooo!

**Puppet:** Oh, my, I&#39;m so sorry! I didn&#39;t notice you //at all//. 

**SCP-6568:** Yes, that&#39;s okay. Especially, considering a large, unknown creature—

**Puppet:** Is coming to EAT MY PLANETS I KNOW GODDAMNIT! 

//SCP-6568 depicts the puppet covering its face with both its short arms.//

**SCP-6568:** Oh, well that saves time—

**Puppet:** //What do you want?//

**SCP-6568:** Uh, I&#39;m actually here to help!

**Puppet:** Is this a joke—? Oh dear world between, //it&#39;s here//!

**SCP-6568:** Listen friend! We know that in some small way, our connection can physically affect your surface, right?

**Puppet:** What? Sure, whatever! Oh you— //Get off! Get off!//

**SCP-6568:** Hey, hey! Calm down! We just have to put our heads together and—

**Puppet:** //My// head is about to explode!

//Still floating, SCP-6568 sits down cross-legged.//

**SCP-6568:** How about we try some deep breathing—

**Puppet:** AHHHHHHH! AHHH! Spit it out!

**SCP-6568:** Hey, just—

**Puppet:** Alright, alright! Tell me what to do!

**SCP-6568:** Well, actually, we have to figure this one together.

**Puppet:** You couldn&#39;t workshop this with someone //else// beforehand? AHH! The gas giant, //too//?! Really?

**SCP-6568** Yes, well it&#39;s all happened so fast...

**Puppet:** That thing is blonking //huge//! You&#39;re crazy! Am I going to shoot it out of the sky?!

**SCP-6568:** Well.... maybe?

//SCP-6568 falls onto the stage. It appears drowsy, but nonetheless quickly scrambles to search through the puppet box for a new puppet. After finding an appropriate one, it begins a new dance, and is soon rising once more.//

**SCP-6568:** Hello! All of your planets are going to be eaten and so it&#39;s very important that you listen to me!

**Puppet:** Who sent you? Whose gloombo are you?

**SCP-6568:** Well, um, no one sent me! I&#39;ve come of my own accord because I have news about imminent calamity arriving to your planets —

//From outside Site-22-A, there is the muffled sound of a helicopter landing.//

**Puppet:** Not falling for this one again.

//SCP-6568 falls suddenly onto the stage platform.//

**SCP-6568:** What?

//SCP-6568 appears more fatigued and again searches for the newly appropriate puppet. It finds one, but appears to hesitate before dancing. Suddenly it returns the puppet to the box, and instead picks out a different one sitting near the top of the puppet pile. SCP-6568 continues dancing once again, reigniting the ritual for a third time.//

//Agents from Mobile Task Force ███████ ████ ████ █████ enter the building carrying a handheld ███████ ██████ device. SCP-6568 takes no notice.//

**SCP-6568:** Hello?

**Puppet:** Hello, child!

//En route to SCP-6568, the agents are suddenly stopped by Dr. Mohan. Dr. Mohan and the agents argue inaudibly. Dr. Mohan is animated and appears angry or frustrated.//

**SCP-6568:** I need guidance. There&#39;s something... coming for us. And I don&#39;t know what to do about it.

**Puppet:** And that&#39;s okay! We never asked you to take on every possible responsibility. 

**SCP-6568:** But, you see, this... thing...!

**Puppet:** There&#39;s no need to sugarcoat anything; I&#39;ve been well informed. There is simply nothing to be done.

**SCP-6568:** So... what? I just have to go now? It doesn&#39;t feel right to go now.

**Puppet:** I understand. Travelling is never easy.

**SCP-6568:** How would you know?

**Puppet:** I travel in other ways.

**SCP-6568:** But... none of this is fair! Don&#39;t you see how wonderful your planets are?

**Puppet:** Of course I do, Sol-Ponk! But these beings have been around so long, and I have been around so long and everything will come undone eventually in the great unravelling; You know that. You would have been forced to confront this reality, eventually.

**SCP-6568:** But //I// haven&#39;t been around so long! And where will I go, anyway? 

**Puppet:** Do not worry! Undoubtedly there will be asteroids and other fragments left over.

**SCP-6568:** And I&#39;ll... I&#39;ll build a temple on those asteroids too, right? Out of rocks and space dust?!

**Puppet:** Yes, because you are an incredibly creative and resourceful gloombo! 

**SCP-6568:** It wouldn&#39;t be the same!

**Puppet:** The same as what?

**SCP-6568:** Haven&#39;t you seen what we&#39;ve built here?

**Puppet:** Please, just go. Go now.

//SCP-6568 falls to the floor, and sits still. It rubs its eyes tenderly.//

**Dr. Mohan:** (//speaking quickly and quietly to the agents//) Just //one more// try, got it?!

//Dr. Mohan hurries onto the stage, while the agents watch her from a few meters behind.//

**Dr. Mohan:** Sol-Ponk?

**SCP-6568:** This is all quite silly, isn&#39;t it.

**Dr. Mohan:** No, no, why do you say that? Is everything okay?

//Dr. Mohan glances behind her at the agents, watching silently.//

**SCP-6568:** I&#39;m gonna become a rock guy, sitting on a big rock in a temple made of tiny rocks. Who will hear me? Only Sol and Worosop and Prieiiei will hear me then. And yet I&#39;ll see everyone! What life is that for a gloombo? I need to sleep.

**Dr. Mohan:** It sounds dreadful, I get it! No one wants to be stuck on a rock. But you&#39;re not there yet, you&#39;re here, and so are they!

//Dr. Mohan gestures to the electric, dancing crowd. This is the first party Site-22 has had in seven months.//

**SCP-6568:** That&#39;s not what Sol said.

**Dr. Mohan:** Sure, but... what&#39;s so bad about listening to me? 

//SCP-6568 says nothing.//

**Dr. Mohan:** Look just give it another go; Whoever&#39;s on the other end, don&#39;t let them shake you off or downplay anything. I don&#39;t believe anyone so ancient could also be so useless.

**SCP-6568:** Okay.

//Dr. Mohan begins dancing. She gestures for SCP-6568 to join her. SCP-6568 reluctantly takes her hand and does so. Soon, they appear to be engaging in a waltz. Not long after, SCP-6568 is being lifted away from its dancing partner.//

**SCP-6568:** I need that one!

//SCP-6568 points towards a particular puppet, and Dr. Mohan throws it up to them. SCP-6568&#39;s attention now turns elsewhere.//

**SCP-6568:** . . . Hello?

**Puppet:** Gloob-wogrababa!

**SCP-6568:** Um. //(SCP-6568 floats downwards and scans its remaining puppets before returning gaze to the speaking puppet.)// Who am I talking to?

**Puppet:** Barbahaga! Obibi-daroom!!

//SCP-6568 looks over the dancing crowd, and then looks to each of the frozingler-domes on the ceiling, apparently looking for some sign. SCP-6568&#39;s eyes rest on the bronze duck statue for a moment, before it seems to come to a realization.//

**SCP-6568:** Are... you...?

**Puppet:** (//SCP-6568 shakes the puppet aggressively as it speaks.//) Aragbarabadoo Wallamra! Sfrabragrhalograb!!!

**SCP-6568:** //Missus &#39;hemoth//? Ooooh!

**Puppet:** Boog.

**SCP-6568:** Aaa, it is such a amazement to be meeting you!

//The puppet screams for ten seconds.//

**SCP-6568:** Okay!

//SCP-6568 lowers to the ground, and nervously runs in a circle before beelining for Dr. Mohan.//

**Dr. Mohan:** What is it?

**SCP-6568:** I need help communicating!

**Dr. Mohan:** Who are you speaking to?

//SCP-6568 mimes the snapping of jaws with its arms.//

**Dr. Mohan:** Is that possible?!

**Puppet:** Brologribwob! Habalabazhube! Zop!

**SCP-6568:** Do you see the issues? All //of this// is made for //frozinglers//! What on the world between does a planetvore want, Jessica?!

**Dr. Mohan:** Oh dear. Okay. Um. Shit.

**Puppet:** Blib blob!!! Zakarakawrow!

**SCP-6568:** (//quietly//) We can&#39;t just rebuild the temple...

//SCP-6568 sits down.//

**Dr. Mohan:** Hey, I have an idea!

**SCP-6568:** //(Wringing hands.)// Okay!

//Dr. Mohan approaches the speakers that were rolled in, and, communicating with the DJ, gets the music to stop, and picks up a microphone.//

**Dr. Mohan:** Everybody! Thank you so so much for showing up, we have an urgent change of plans though. We&#39;re going to need everybody with a good neck for it to headbang. Does anyone have, uh, grunge metal?

//Junior Researcher Pollock raises his hand, and Dr. Mohan motions him to the stage, where they plug in his smartphone. Slow, muddy metal begins to play from the speakers.//

//SCP-6568 runs to Dr. Mohan and tugs on her pant leg.//

**SCP-6568:** But this is terrible!!

**Dr. Mohan:** Sol wouldn&#39;t like it, no, but I think our monster might have an ear for it.

**SCP-6568:** How do you dance to this?!

//Dr. Mohan motions to the crowd, and SCP-6568 takes it in. SCP-6568 looks back to Dr. Mohan, who raises her right hand, and emphasizes the slow downbeats.//

**SCP-6568:** It is death music.

**Dr. Mohan:** Exactly. Dance.

//SCP-6568 attempts several false starts, resembling its more common forms of dance, failing to attach to the beat of the music. Then, frowning, SCP-6568 closes its eyes, and begins to slowly sway back and forth, coming forward on the downbeat and swaying backwards on the backbeat. Slowly, SCP-6568&#39;s forward motion becomes more violent, head dipping lower. The frown slowly melts from its face, giving way to a neutral but focused expression, eyes still closed. As it raises its right arm into the air, and place its left hand in a fist over its heart, it begins to levitate again.//

//Concurrently, the lights coming from the disco ball dim, and transform exclusively into shades of red and purple. The frozinglers&#39; faces have twisted into angry frowns, and the colored statues seem mostly to cower in fear, though one is seen swaying to the beat.//

//SCP-6568&#39;s face twists into one of anger as a messy guitar solo begins. It opens its eyes, as the puppet floats towards it.//

**SCP-6568:** MRS. MONSTER, HEAR ME NOW!! I AM --

//SCP-6568 loses focus as the puppet&#39;s head inflates and then pops.//

**SCP-6568:** Ah, what?

//SCP-6568 turns to Dr. Mohan to say something, but she is apparently too absorbed in her own dancing to take any immediate notice. SCP-6568 shrugs.//

**SCP-6568:** Hm. Oh well!

//One of the statues runs on stage with an electric guitar, not plugged in but anomalously still producing noise.//

**SCP-6568:** ARE YOU READY EVERYONE? 

//The statue strikes a chord on the guitar. The crowd cheers.//

**SCP-6568:** RARARARARARARARA!

Sometime around the end of the preceding excerpt, the unidentified extraterrestrial threat ceased to be detected by extrasolar monitoring stations. The exact nature of the entity and SCP-6568&#39;s role in its inexplicable disappearance is unknown. Interviews with SCP-6568 on this matter have produced very little information of interest. A large scale investigation into these events, involving Sites 3, 22 and 56 was launched immediately following the incident and is ongoing.

Additionally, following these events multiple staff members at Site-22 have requested that similar social gatherings such as what took place on the 11th occur again in the future on a semi-regular basis, citing reduced stress and improved morale. In the interest of all parties, Director Duncan has approved this measure. 

Excluding those already privy to such information, no Site-22 employees are to be informed of the full extent of the threat posed on the 11th of October.

**Incident Log __13/10/2009__:** At 10:33 ACST, a hyper-fast moving object was detected entering the Earth&#39;s outer orbit by the Australian Department of Defense. Travelling at ~1000 km/s, the object would have caused large scale destruction to nearby human settlements if it were to make contact with the Earth.  Why this object was not noticed earlier is unknown. An anti-meteor missile was deployed, however, just before the missile was to make contact, the object suddenly changed its trajectory so that it avoided midair collision. Disaster was averted when, in the moment before impact with the Earth, the object rapidly decelerated, creating what was discovered to be only a small crater at the site of impact.

At roughly the same time this information was being relayed to the SCP Foundation, Researcher Kalvin Young discovered that SCP-6568 was absent from Site-22-A. A sticky note was found stuck to the face of one of the alien statues, written on which was the following: &#34;Sorry for breaking the rule, i will be back soon, i Ponky promise :)&#34;.

A Foundation investigation and containment team were the first to arrive at the crash site, and the following was recorded at discovery;

//Perspective is of a camera attached to the bonnet of a jeep at the head of the small convoy.//

//Sparse trees pass by the camera as the vehicle drives through the light forestation.//

//Eventually a small clearing comes into view, in which there is a crater a few meters across. The bottom of it is not visible, and a single tree has been toppled by the unknown object&#39;s impact.//

//The vehicle and another behind it stop, and three men with protective gear and light firearms exit the first. The camera view switches to the agent closest to the crater&#39;s edge.//

//As the group cautiously approach, a light tapping is heard from within the crater.//

//With his weapon drawn, the frontmost agent peers over the side of the crater and its contents come into view.//

//In the middle of the crater are two stubby reptilian entities, holding hands and dancing jovially.//
