**Item #:** SCP-1089-J

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Texts additional to the master copy describing SCP-1089-J are to be actively sought by Foundation plants[[footnote]]Non-botanical.[[/footnote]] within occult communities. Recovered copies are to be safeguarded in a standard security folder and placed inside drawer 3C in room 29B of Site-21. Texts are to remain there until such a time that their authenticity can be verified independently by no less than three Foundation thaumaturgists who hold speciality licensing in Kinetology. Once confirmed, the texts are to be either incinerated, placed into dedicated anomalospatial landfills, or given that they meet the prerequisites, become subject to their own instructions.

**Description:** SCP-1089-J is an kinetologic incantation that results in the instantaneous dematerialization of a targeted object. SCP-1089-J requires no expertise or familiarity in thaumaturgical applications on the part of the practitioner,[[footnote]]Who are frequently unwitting participants in the ritual.[[/footnote]] and has been successfully performed by those of no prior ability and prowess.

Texts describing SCP-1089-J identify the following prerequisites to be present at the time of the incantation:
# An irreplaceable (favored), or an otherwise not immediately replaceable (sufficient), target object that does not exceed 150 grams in weight.
# Underfoot carpeting or padding, to act as an incantatory area.[[footnote]]Must be of a surface area sufficient to facilitate the kneeling and sustained shuffling of the practitioner; approximately 0.5 square meter at minimum.[[/footnote]]
# A maximum of one witness.[[footnote]]The bystanding individual is to not be capable of visualizing the totality of the incantatory area.[[/footnote]]
# Insufficient time to waste, particularly so at the time of and in the immediate aftermath of the incantation.


After satisfying the above conditions, the practitioner must inadvertently drop the target object within the designated incantatory area. The practitioner is not to visually track the object’s descent, if SCP-1089-J is to be performed correctly.

The practitioner is to then kneel upon the incantatory area with flexion at the hip and knees, such that the face is in close proximity to the surface. SCP-1089-J requires the practitioner to kinetologically place their palms upon the surface of the incantatory area and make repeated, pan-directional sweeping motions, preferably in large swaths. 

Radiochemical tagging has confirmed that the target object dematerializes gradually, and in direct proportion to the haste with which the kinetological motions are performed. Once the entirety of the incantatory area has been canvassed by the practitioner, the incantation is considered complete. Researchers and thaumaturgists have at no time recovered a target object that has been made subject to SCP-1089-J.

[[size 90%]]**2. Interview with Walden Mollis**[[/size]]

//The following interview was conducted with Level 5 Thumaturge Walden Mollis to ascertain potential recovery options for objects lost to SCP-1089-J, many of which were sorely needed back, especially at the time of their hexing. Level 4 Researcher Dr. Emeri Tuss facilitating.//

&gt; {{The following interview has been transcribed by a Foundation-certified stenographer.}}
&gt; 
&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tuss:** Walden...
&gt; 
&gt; **Mollis:** ...yes?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tuss:** ...how are you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mollis:** ...good.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tuss:** You&#39;re a Level 5 Thumaturge here, is that correct?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mollis:** That&#39;s why I&#39;m here. You know this already.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tuss:** I see. 
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Mollis:** Is there something else, some certain data perhaps, that you are wanting to get from me...?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tuss:** ...hmm. //Hmmm//.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mollis:** (//Sighs//) I&#39;m well aware that your superiors like your interview hours to exceed a minimum quota and all, but I really don&#39;t have time for this. Let&#39;s get on with what we both know we&#39;re here for.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tuss:** Fair enough. Now. Thumaturge... Mollis, was it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mollis:** Yes for Christ&#39;s sake!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tuss:** Ah. I see. (//Writes on notepad//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Mollis:** If you don&#39;t ask the //one fucking// question we are all three here for right this second, I am going to anatomically flip your lips and your anal sphincter.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tuss:** Is there any conceivable way, any way at all, to retrieve those objects lost to SCP-1089-J?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mollis:** Hell no.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tuss:** Thank you for your time.
