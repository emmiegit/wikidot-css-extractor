++++ Special Containment Procedures 

The Parham University clock tower is to be barred from public access. Any and all interaction with the clockwork mechanism of the tower is to be authorized by the SCP-7252 research head. All communications with entities within SCP-7252-A are to be logged in this database entry.

Entry into SCP-7252-A is currently permitted to Foundation staff who have undergone wilderness survival training and who have been certified in rudimentary telecommunication formats.

------

++++ Description 

SCP-7252 is the clockwork structure of the Parham University clock tower located in Youngstown, Ohio, USA. The tower itself possesses no anomalous features.

The clockwork asserts its anomalous nature between 02:00 and 03:00 EST. During this period, the pendulum of the clockwork slowly ceases to swing and rests at its lowest position. A ladder then extends downward from the upper portion of the tower. This allows for exiting the tower via a hatch that is only accessible during this time period. This exit opens to the top of the tower and allows entry into SCP-7252-A. Upon initial Foundation assessment, both the interior and exterior of this hatch were noted to have been badly damaged.

]]

SCP-7252-A is a dimension wherein the clock tower maintains its appearance, however it is surrounded on all sides by a large body of water. One land mass is visible in the distance with 83 towers erected along its shore each of which are similar in design to the tower housing SCP-7252.

The rooftop of the tower where one enters into SCP-7252-A is equipped with a telescope and a heliograph[[footnote]]A mechanism used to transmit Morse code messages using a shutter and a mirror. Flashes are produced by occluding the light from the mirror using the shutter.[[/footnote]]. Messaging using the heliograph pointed toward the shore typically prompts a return message from one, or more, towers. It is presumed at this time that there are multiple sapient entities responsible for these messages.

++++ Addendum 7252.1: Discovery

**21 SEP 2021**: Parham University students Katherine Wagner, Harold Robinson, and Amelia Ibanez go missing. The FBI was contacted by local law enforcement in order to aid in their investigation. After discovering that the students had last been seen entering into the university clock tower, FBI assets examined the tower for any clues as to the students&#39; location.

Two of the students were found within the upper portion of the tower in a state of severe shock three days after they went missing. Each of them was found to have frostbite to their hands and feet as well as severe dehydration. Following eight days in a local hospital&#39;s intensive care unit, one of the recovered students reported to the interviewing FBI agent that she had entered into SCP-7252-A which was relayed to the UIU and the Foundation.

That went on for at least a few hours.

**Wagner:** We just thought it was some weird light thing and didn&#39;t pay it any mind. So we were hanging out, and then decided that we were going to leave, but the fucking door wouldn&#39;t open. We all tried and it wouldn&#39;t budge. So we freaked out for a while.
