**Special Containment Procedures:** The town of Willimantic, Connecticut is to be fenced off in 5km. Roads leading to the towns of Franklin, Chaplin, Mansfield, Windham, Coventry, Colombia, and Lebanon are to be closed off and rerouted (refer to Protocol Shiva-7-1). Civilians that attempt to enter the five-kilometer exclusion zone around Willimantic are to be detained and transported to Outpost-VI for questioning and administered Class-B amnestics. The area around Willimantic has been declared an official no-fly zone for all commercial and recreational aerocrafts. Any aeroplanes are to be cautioned of the $750,000 penalty for entering the restricted zone. Aeroplanes that disregard this warning are to be located and administered Class-B amnestics upon landing. Finally, cover stories of chemical waste in the town are to be broadcasted.

**Description:** SCP-6631 is a phenomenon in which a yellow triangular glyph appears 65-meters in the sky every five hours. SCP-6631 is almost always located at the Pomeroy State Park Scenic Reserve, though, it can manifest anywhere surrounding Willimantic. SCP-6631 emits a 32,000LM [[footnote]]A distance of light that is 806 meters.[[/footnote]] cognitohazardous light that when viewed, turns victims into instances of SCP-6631. Currently, there are no solutions to reverse the affect. 

SCP-6631-1 are the victims of SCP-6631 that act as a collective consciousness of either SCP-6631 or SCP-6631-2. SCP-6631-1 instances have glowing yellow eyes and light emitting from their opened mouths. The process of becoming an SCP-6631-1 is instantaneous. Replacing the former consciousness the individual had with SCP-6631 or SCP-6631-2. Physically, all SCP-6631-1 instances remain the same. Behavioral changes of SCP-6631-1 are when they are commanded by SCP-6631-2 accordingly or walk to wherever SCP-6631 activates. When SCP-6631-1 instances are not being commanded by SCP-6631 or SCP-6631-2, they either wander the area or stand in place. Any instance of SCP-6631-1 that detects an organism that isn&#39;t part of the hivemind will attempt to capture it and keep it captive until SCP-6631 appears. 

SCP-6631-2 is an African-American male in its early 50&#39;s, having the same district traits as SCP-6631-1, however, acts as the second half of SCP-6631 consciousness. SCP-6631-2 can verbally and non-verbally command all SCP-6631-1 instances regardless of distance. While acting as the second half of SCP-6631&#39;s consciousness, SCP-6631-2 seems to retain its sentience. All Site-77 research personnel assigned to SCP-6631 are to monitor SCP-6631-2 closely.

**Discovery:** In 2010, 172 people were reported missing across the state of Connecticut in the span of two months. No traces of the missing persons were found during the investigations spearheaded by local law enforcement. Once the public grew aware of the rising number of missing persons across the state of Connecticut, the Federal Bureau of Investigations were involved, but their findings were inconclusive. During the period of high missing persons cases, a satellite belonging to the multinational cable channel CNN captured footage of SCP-6631. When Foundation Containment Teams were dispatched, they were approached by the Unusual Incidents Unit, who provided footage from a dashboard camera from a subject named Jerry Nicolson. A 26-year-old caucasian male who was affiliated with Parawatch. When Foundation gained access to his account, he posted the following on the site&#39;s forum.

Okay, so you know all those disappearances of people on the news? I think they&#39;re all here, in Willimantic. I live in Mansfield and I saw a group of people walking where the town was. I even see my parents and my uncle who lives in Windham walking to it? I went up to them but something was weird about their eyes. They haven&#39;t come back since. I called the police and told them about it, we did a whole search for them but nothing showed up. I&#39;ve been looking that place up, trying to dig something up but there was nothing. Maybe aliens? Either way, I need to find them. Wish me luck.

**DATE:** 4/13/2010

[BEGIN LOG]

//The time is 23:11. The headlights show the roads and trees passing by as the song &#34;Just the Way You Are&#34; by Bruno Mars plays on the radio. Jerry taps on the wheel with the beat of the song until his phone rings. He turns the volume down and answers the call.//

**Jerry:** Hello...? Hey, what&#39;s up...? No, nothing yet... Yeah, I remember... What&#39;s your point...? Are you fucking serious..? No! Maybe they missed something... They don&#39;t know that! You don&#39;t know that!... What does that have to do with anything...? Wow, thanks...Look, I don&#39;t know what to tell you but if you&#39;re that worried, you should&#39;ve come with me... Then help me out, you think I wanna be here, at night with no one else for miles!? I&#39;m scared too, shit. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s out there, but they&#39;re still my parents... I bet you would do the same thing if you were in my shoes... I know... I will... Love you too. 

//He hangs up and tosses the phone on the passenger seat. He rolls down the window and rests his arm on it.//

//Extraneous footage removed. Recording resumes at 23:45. The car is parked on the side with Jerry urinating beside the car. Once he&#39;s finished he walks back to his car before snapping his head behind him.//

**Jerry:** Hello?

//Dashboard camera doesn&#39;t pick up any sound. Jerry takes a few steps closer to his car while still keeping his head towards the direction of where he heard the noise.//

**Jerry:** Hello? Is someone there?

//Jerry tilts his head and stands there for a couple of seconds until he rushes into his car and tries to turn on the ignition. A man with yellow glowing eyes and glowing light emitting from his mouth jumps on top of the hood and presses his body on the windshield. Jerry starts the car and drives, trying to shake off the man. The man punches on the windshield, trying to break through but Jerry slams the breaks, causing the man to fly off the hood and roll onto the road. Jerry accelerates and passes by him. Jerry is breathing heavily while trying to stabilize the car.//

**Jerry:** What the fuck!? What the fuck!? What the fuck!? Oh my God! Holy shit!

//He continues to drive for eight minutes until the dash camera shows him approaching a person. He slows down the car and dims the headlights to see them clearer. It&#39;s a woman, who also has the same glowing yellow eyes and the light-emitting from her open mouth. After a couple of seconds, a horde of people rushes out of the woods and to the car. Jerry drives backward and more people were coming out of the woods, chasing him. The car bumps a few times and hards to his right, crashing into a tree. He shifts the gears to drive and tries to escape but the SCP-6631-1 instances pile on top of the car. Obscuring the vision and trying to break in. They pound and crack the glass, but Jerry was able to plow through the crowd. The car bumps violently with crunching bones underneath. Eventually, he made his way out of the crowd at top speed. Jerry&#39;s screams and cries are heard from the background. From above, lines and dots form in the sky, disrupting the footage.//


[[=image http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-lost-in-the-evening-stroll/Symbol%20Footage%20Dashcam]]

//He slows down the car to a stop. The sound of the door opening and then shutting. The camera still glitching, shows Jerry walking towards SCP-6631 until he&#39;s no longer visible. Forty minutes later, other SCP-6631-1 instances walk to SCP-6631. SCP-6631 remains for an hour until it fades away.//

//The footage cuts to 24:15, with flashing red and blue is seen reflecting on the hood.//

**Police Officer 1:** Dispatch, be advised for a potential 10-57, missing person, over.

**Dispatch:** Copy.

**Police Officer 2:** Christ, what kind of psycho drives like that? There&#39;s blood everywhere.

**Police Officer 1:** Still no bodies?

**Police Officer 2:** Nope. Somebody must&#39;ve picked them up. Praying that they&#39;re okay. 

**Police Officer 1:** Yeah. We got a dashcam, it&#39;s still recording.

**Police Officer 2:** A lead?

**Police Officer 1:** Let&#39;s hope so.

[[collapsible hideLocation=&#34;both&#34; show=&#34;+ View Drone Footage&#34; hide=&#34;- Close Drone Footage&#34;]]

SCPRD &#34;Hermes&#34; was deployed on 06/11/2010 at 10:27 to venture deep into the SCP-6XXX exclusion zone and search for possible clues to the origins of the anomaly.

 [[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

//Hermes flies above the trees, scoping out any anomalous activity. Hermes camera tilts down and spots an SCP-6631-1 instance and approaches it. The SCP-6631-1 instance looks up at Hermes with its glowing eyes and mouth and makes attempts to grab the drone by repeatedly jumping up with its arms stretched out. Hermes continues on its flight but the SCP-6631-1 follows it, still with its arms out. A couple more SCP-6631-1 instances join in to grab Hermes As Hermes continues to fly, more and more SCP-6631-1 instances appear below, all attempting to grab it Hermes flies faster to lose them but they still give chase while more SCP-6631-1 instances keep coming.//

//Hermes ascends to a higher altitude of 800 feet in the air.  After a couple of minutes of continuous flight, Hermes descends, and the SCP-6631-1 instances are no longer seen. As Hermes continues, light flashes to the southeast. Hermes turns and sees SCP-6631 and zooms in. Footage from Hermes gets distorted.//

[[=image http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-lost-in-the-evening-stroll/Drone%20Footage%20Symbol]]

//As Hermes flies towards SCP-6631, the microphone picks up audio of a woman’s screams increasing in volume. Seven minutes later, it reaches where SCP-6631 is floating directly above a farmhouse. Hermes spots the SCP-6631-1 instances entering the house. Hermes descends and circles the house. It zooms into the windows for any activity, though there were no SCP-6631-1 instances in the second floor. Hermes, however, spots the other SCP-6631-1 instances on the first floor and seems to enter another door. Hermes circles the house again to find any openings to which it has found none. Hermes is called back to the compound.//

The Foundation proceeds in containing SCP-6631. No traces of any SCP-6631-1 instance were reported during the containment. The Foundation deployed Mobile Task Force Eta-10 (&#34;See No Evil&#34;), with handpicked agents who had undertaken the A.I.M. Course. [[footnote]] Agents who completed the A.I.M. course have been rendered unwavering against most types of cognitohazardous anomalies, excluding SCP-[REDACTED].[[/footnote]] and sent 25 agents in groups of five into the exclusion zone to gather more thorough information on SCP-6631 and its effects on SCP-6631-1 subjects.

On their return to Site-77, only two agents of Iota-12 were recovered, while the rest were deemed M.I.A. The following footage is as followed:

**Igni-1-1: Captain Duke Odum**

**Igni-1-2 Leutinet Paul Aidens**

**Igni-1-3 Lauteniet Dixon Mink**

**Igni-1-4 Private Julian Mowery**

**Igni-1-5 Private Kenny Fordes**

----------

**Command:** Checking.

**1-1:** Check.

**1-2:** Green here.

**1-3:** Checkity check-check.

**1-4:** Check here.

**1-5:** Check.

**Command:** You are green Iota-12. Good luck. 

**1-1:** On me. 

//MTF stops at Mansfield Middle School and enters the vicinity of SCP-6631 on foot.//

**1-1:** Alrighty, we got three hours before SCP-6631 activates. Stay frosty for any -1&#39;s, and you let us know as soon as you see one. We&#39;re not here looking for a fight. We collect as much data as possible, and we book it. God knows how many people it has in its control. Am I clear?

**All members:** Yes sir!

//Iota-12 hikes through Schoolhouse Brook Park for 10 minutes straight with no sightings of SCP-6631-1.//

**1-4:** Command, question.

**Command:** Go ahead.

**I-4:** Isn&#39;t it kinda weird that when we locked this place down, there hadn&#39;t been any -1&#39;s around?

**1-2:** Yeah, I second that. Hell, they could&#39;ve gotten through the fence at any time. 

**Command:** Acknowledged. If SCP-66631 has a motive for its inaction, perhaps that can be to our advantage to further its containment. Whatever those motives are, find them and return safely.

**1-4:** Copy.

//Iota-12 continues to wander the forest for twenty minutes without any SCP-6631-1 instance sightings.// 

**1-5:** Not that I&#39;m complaining, but, weirdly, we haven&#39;t seen any SCP-6631-1 instances?

**1-3:** Yeah, kinda giving me the heebee jeebies. 

**1-1:**  Command, how is it up there?

**Command:** No sign of any SCP-6631-1 instances nearby. 

**1-2:** God, imagine if they start popping out of the ground.

**1-3:** Well, it was nice knowing you guys. Imma head back. 

**Command:** Lauteniet Mink.

**1-3:** Kidding Command. 

**1-1:**  Hold up. Got one up ahead. 

//Iota-12 raises their weapons and crouches behind bushes and trees. An SCP-6631-1 instance is visible across from them. It wanders with its head down, paying no mind to the team. Iota-12 watches it walk into the deep woods until it is no longer visible. They stand up from their spots.// 

**1-2:** Should we follow it? It could lead us somewhere. 

**1-4:** Better than what we&#39;ve been doing.

**1-1:**  Command? Any other instances nearby?

**Command:** None so far.

**1-1:** Alrighty. Let&#39;s follow it. 1-4 and 1-5, you guys keep an eye on our six. 1-2 and 1-3, keep an eye on our sides. 

**All members:** Yes sir.

//Iota-12 follows the SCP-6631-1 for a few minutes and halts when they see it enter a two-story brown house.//

**1-1:**  Command, SCP-6631-1 enterd a house. Should we proceed to follow it? 

**Command:** Affirmative. You may follow it in the house, should it give us anything about the rest of the instance&#39;s behavior. 

**1-1:** Copy. 4. You&#39;re with me. The rest of you, keep an eye out. 

//1-1 and 1-4 picked the door lock and made their way into the home. Its floor is beige carpet so its steps are muffled. They sneak around the house with 1-1 in the front and 1-4 behind him. Footsteps from the ceiling are heard, both 1-1 and 1-4 carefully make their way up the stairs and follow where the footsteps went. They hear movement on the left side and have their rifles ready. 1-1 Slowly opens the door and sees the SCP-6631-1 instance staring out the window. He closes the door and gestures I-4 to the other door across. 1-4 opens the door carefully and sees 1-2 and other SCP-6631-1 are standing in place. They both quietly leave the residency and regroup with the rest of the team.//

**1-5:** What happened in there?

**1-4:**  They&#39;re just standing there doing nothing. 

**1-3:** How many?

**1-1:** Just two more inside. 

**1-5:** So that&#39;s what they&#39;ve all been doing? Just nothing? But then why was that one walking around alone?

**1-4:** Maybe it was scouting.

**I-3:** Looked kinda depressed for a lookout. 

**1-1:**  Either way, this makes our jobs a little easier. We can get to SCP-6631 with no trouble. Command, how far are we?

**Command:** Halfway there Iota. 

//After another twenty minutes of hiking, Iota-12 reaches the house. At this point, they&#39;re walking through an open field.// 

**Command:** Hold it.

**1-1:**  What is it?

**Command:** SCP-6631 instances are all around the house. Probably more inside. 

**1-5:** So what&#39;s the plan?

**1-1:**  We&#39;re gonna need to get all those -1&#39;s away from the house. Damn.

//Iota-12 remains silent.//

**1-5:**  Could we throw something loud to get them away? 

**Command:** You only got two hours left before SCP-6631 activates. 

**1-2:** How loud are we talking? We might lose our element of surprise.

**1-3:** Think that was thrown out the window when we stepped foot on this field. 

**I-4:** Got any better ideas?

**1-3:** Maybe I can be the bait. I can circle the house and get their attention. Hopefully, I&#39;ll only get the ones by the house. But that should leave you guys a window to get inside.

**1-1:**  You think you&#39;ll make it?

**1-3:** I won two gold medals in track back in Uni. Used that to get away from an ex so yeah, I think I&#39;ll make it.   

**1-1:**  Let’s pray on it. 

//1-3 leaves the group. His feed shows him staying low from the SCP-6631-1 instances view. 4 minutes later, 1-3 fires his rifle in the air, and the SCP-6631-1 group runs in the direction of the gunfire. He runs to the woods and continues to fire his weapon. The rest of Iota head to the house and prepare to breach. They look through the windows with nobody inside, they toss in a flash bang and storm in. After they went inside, they scout the first floor with no human or anomalous activity. They were about to move up to the second floor but an old farmer points a doubled-barrel shotgun at 1-1.//

**Farmer:** Who the hell are you?

**1-1:**  We got an armed civilian!

**Farmer:** I said who are you!?

//1-1 backs up from the stairs with his weapon still aiming at the farmer.//

**1-1:**  Sir, put your weapon down.

**Farmer:**  I wanna know why you broke into my house, first.

//The rest of Iota aim their rifles at the farmer as he’s slowly walking down the stairs. The farmer eyes each member.//

**Farmer:**  Am I under arrest? I didn’t do anything.

**1-1:** Sir, we just want to talk, but I need you to put your weapon away. 

**Farmer:** Tell you what. We can both put our guns against that wall by the door. And I mean ALL guns. Then we’ll talk.

//1-1 lowers his weapons and places them on against the wall. He also removes his pistol and lays it on the floor, gesturing for the others to do the same. The rest of the team remove their weapons and so does the farmer with his shotgun. He places it with the others.//

**Farmer:**  Now we can talk. 

//The farmer leads Iota to his living room. They all have a seat on the couches.//

**Farmer:**  Now, you mind telling me why you men broke into my home?

**1-1:**  We didn&#39;t think anyone was inside. 

**Farmer:**  Still doesn&#39;t answer my question. 

**1-1:**  Well. Were you aware of those people surrounding your home?

**Farmer:** Them? I mean, yeah. What do they got to do with this? 

**1-1:**  So do you know what&#39;s been happening?

**Farmer:**  Son, I don&#39;t know what the Hell is happening so you got some explaining to do. 

**1-2:** Did you notice something off about them? The people around your home, I mean.

**Farmer:** Glowing eyes and shit, yeah, it&#39;s weird alright. I tried scaring them off but they wouldn&#39;t leave. But they never barged in either. 

**1-1:**  Not even when you leave?

**Farmer:**  Nope. They just stand there like a bunch of crackheads. 

**1-4:** Have you seen the news?

**Farmer:** I don&#39;t watch that anymore. Always showing all the bad stuff going on, y&#39;know.

**1-4:** Well sir, a lot of people went missing and those said missing people are apparently here. We want to find out why. 

**Farmer:** Hmm. Well, I don&#39;t really know if I&#39;ll be of help to you. 

**1-1:** You are. Just answering some of our questions will be more than enough. 

**Farmer:**  Alright then. 

**1-5:** What&#39;s your name?

**Farmer:** Harold. 

**1-5:** Harold. Have you seen this, anywhere?

//1-5 shows Harold a photo of SCP-6631.//

**Harold:** I have, now and then. 

**1-5:** Have you felt off when you did?

**Harold:** Nope. Never. 

**1-2:** Where have you seen it?

**Harold:** All over. Far. close. Even here. I&#39;ve tried going to it on several occasions but by the time I got there, it would either disappear or lead me to the middle of nowhere. Along with all the rest of these people. 

**1-1:**  And you were still not affected by it, even when you were close to it?

**Harold:**That&#39;s right.

**1-1:** And the people still left you alone?

**Harold:** Yes. Honestly, I don&#39;t know what else to make of it. 

**1-4:** What can you tell us about your time here when it started?

**Harold:** Well... My wife has gotten sick and I was still trying to work on the harvest. And as you know, I don&#39;t watch much TV. I was preoccupied for the majority of the beginning. But when I first saw it. The thing in the sky. Not gonna lie, I thought it was some new light show tech stuff or whatever that was happening. But then, after a few minutes, I saw people walking through my field, eyes, and mouths glowing. I was creeped out. But they paid no attention to me. So I hunkered in my house and waited it out. At some point, a group would stay here and not leave until the thing showed up. 

**1-1:**  Why haven&#39;t you left yet?

**Harold:** I can&#39;t leave my wife here. Especially when the doctors are probably walking around with the rest of them. I have to be the one to take care of her 24/7. 

**1-5:** Did you try contacting anyone?

**Harold:** I did. Numerous times. But, oh god. They&#39;re probably a part of it too.

//Harold leans forward and covers his forehead.//

**Harold:** I honestly don&#39;t know what else to do. I&#39;ve tried everything but...

**1-2:** Has your wife seen the glyphs in the sky?

**Harold:** No. She&#39;s asleep most of the time. 

**1-1:**  Do you mind if we speak to her?

**Harold:** I absolutely do mind. She&#39;s going through too much as it is, and I don&#39;t want her to be in any panic. 

**1-1:**  We can help you, and your wife. 

**Harold:** How?

**1-1:**  We can escort you and your wife out of here and get her to a hospital. But you might need to come with us.

**Harold:** Why me?

**1-1:**  If what you&#39;re saying is true. Then maybe you can help us with this.

**Harold:** I don&#39;t know. 

**1-1:**  My men can&#39;t stay here. One of mine is risking his life out there just for us to have this conversation. I&#39;m sorry Harold, but I&#39;m not asking you. 

**Harold:** Can I at least let my wife know what&#39;s going on? 

**1-1:** Yes, you can. 

//Harold stands from his chair and walks over the stairs. He climbs up and his footsteps are heard from above, as well as a door closing.//

**1-1:**  1-3, are you still with us? 

//Static noises.//

**1-1:**  Mink, are you there?

//Static noises.//

**1-1:**  Command.

**Command:** Copy 1-1.

**1-1:**  Any visual on 1-3?

**Command:** 1-3 retreated to a building with the SCP-6631-1 instances on his tail. Neither had come out yet. 

**1-1:** Shit, he&#39;s that far?

**Command:** What&#39;s your status?

**1-1:** We got two civilians. Elderly couple. One is a sick woman who needs medical attention ASAP. The husband seems to be immune to the cognitohazard, and has not been approached by the SCP-6631-1 instances. Although, we&#39;re still not sure why a handful of them was standing around his house. 

**Command:** Acknowledged. You still have plenty of time before SCP-6631 activates, but I&#39;d still recommend you get out of there ASAP.

**1-1:**  Copy that. Though the wife might be difficult. 

**Command:** I will leave you to it. Stay safe.

**1-1:**  Understood. 

//1-1 stands up and walks to get his rifle and pistol than to the stairs.//

**1-1:**  Harold! It&#39;s time to go!

**Harold:** Just give me a second!

//1-1 climbs up the stairs.//

**1-1:** We&#39;ll figure something out with your wife, but we need to get moving! Harold!

//I-2 follows I-1, gesturing for the others to stand by. 1-4 and 1-5 grab their rifles and pistols. 1-1 creeps through the halls, knocking on the first door.//

**1-1:** Harold? 

//1-1 opens the door to see a small white bathroom.//

**1-1:**  We don&#39;t have time for games, man. Come out. 

//1-1 opens another door which is a closet filled with jackets and shirts.//

**1-2:** What&#39;s taking so long?

**1-1:** Something isn&#39;t right. Cover me. 

//1-1 moves to the next door while 1-2 is catching up to him. He stops and looks at the bottom of the closet and sees a binder with straight, angular lines. He crouches and takes it out, revealing the cover to be the same symbol as SCP-6631.//

**I-2:** Captain, hold up! 

//He rushes to I-1, showing him the binder.//

**1-2:** Look at this. 

**1-1:** Shit. Hold onto it. Harold! 

//1-1 opens the bedroom door, with nobody inside. They see a wide-open window and investigate the room. 1-1 sees a fire escape and then Harold who’s running on the field.//

**1-1:** He’s making a run for it!

//1-1 and 1-2 rush through the hallway and down the stairs.//

**1-1:** Let’s go! 

//1-1 opens the door and chases Harold with 1-2 behind him. 1-4 and 1-5 quickly grab their weapons and join up with them.//

**1-4:** Command! We got a runner, making a break for the woods.

**Command:** What happened in there?

**1-2:** I got myself a binder that can probably tell us more about SCP-6631. It was in his closet. He knows something about it.

**Command:** Copy. Take him in.

**1-4:** Any sign of 1-3?

**Command:** Negative. What of the wife?

**1-1:** Couldn’t find her. 

**Command:** Understood. I see SCP-6631-1 instances ahead.

//SCP-6631-1 emerges out from the trees and toward Harold.//

**Harold:** Get them!

//The SCP-6631-1 instances run passes him and to Iota-12.  The team aims their weapons and starts shooting them down. But another group of SCP-6631-1 instances emerges from their sides. The squad retaliate, shooting the incoming SCP-6631-1 instances. Harold slows down and turns around with the team eventually catching up to him. Harold pants and looks at Iota-12 with yellow glowing eyes.//

**1-1:** Command, he’s one of them.

**Command:** Stay alert.

//Iota-12 aims their rifles at SCP-6631-2.//

**1-1:** Get on the ground now!

**SCP-6631-2:** It was you wasn’t it? The big fence and all.

**I-2:** Hands up and on the ground!

//SCP-6631-2 stands up straight with its eyes still at the MTF.//

**1-1:** What did you do to this place!?

//SCP-6631-2 does not respond. 1-5 approaches SCP-6631-2 and when he got close at an arms distance, SCP-6631-2 screams for nine seconds.//

**1-5:** What was that for? 

**SCP-6631-2:** You boys should’ve left us be.

**1-4:** We got contact on our Southeast side!

//A large group of SCP-6631-1 runs towards Iota-12. 1-5 grabs SCP-6631 and brings them to the team.//

**1-5:** Call them off!

**1-2:** We gotta get out of here!

//1-5 shakes SCP-6631-2 violently and shoves his barrel at its temple.//

**1-5:** I said call them off!

**Command:** Iota-12, there’s a horde of SCP-6631-1 instances on your way. Get a move on.

**I-3:** What about Dixon?

**Command:** Still no sign of him. I’m sorry, but you need to get out while you can.

**1-1:** Fucking Christ! Let’s go!

**I-5:** What about this one?!

**1-1:** Forget it, now come on!

//1-5 takes his gun away from SCP-6631-2, and the rest of the team runs up north.//

**Command:** You got several SCP-6631-1 instances up ahead.

//Iota-12 aims their weapons and fire upon the incoming SCP-6631-1 instances with successful shots. They made it into the forests and continue their escape. After a few minutes of running, they notice other SCP-6631-1 instances running from their sides. When the instances were closing in, each member took their shot on them. After 1-4 shoot an SCP-6631-1 instance from his left, he quickly glances behind him and sees the horde that&#39;s been chasing them grow in quantity. The extra SCP-6631-1 instances go to the horde in their pursuit. 1-4 turns his head back and hits a tree.//

**I-5:** Julian!

//I-5 stops and runs back to I-4. He slides next to him and tries to pick him up while scrambling to do the same.//

**-I-5:** Come on! Stand up!

//I-4 wobbly stands but when he takes a step, he tumbles back down. I-5 clings to him to give him support.//

**1-1:** Where are you guys!?

**1-5:** Mowery got knocked out. I went back for him.

**1-1:** You need to hurry up, we&#39;re almost out of here!

//1-5 throws 1-4 onto his back and jogs.//

**1-5:** Come on. Come on. Come on. You got this. 

//After twenty seconds of jogging, a single SCP-6631-1 instance tackles 1-5, making him drop 1-4. 1-5 aimed his rifle and shoots the instance. He crawls in front of 1-4 and fires upon the incoming horde. Eventually, they reach them and tackle 1-5, obscuring the camera&#39;s view.//

**1-5:** (muffling) Get the fuck off me!

//A few seconds later, they disperse and pick both 1-5 and 1-4. 1-5 struggles from their hold and sees 1-4 in front of him and the horde running past them. Meanwhile, 1-1 and 1-2 made it back to Mansfield Middle School with both of them rushing to get inside their vehicle. 1-1 takes the driver&#39;s seat while 1-2 goes in the back. I-1 starts the vehicle and accelerates out of the parking lot and to the main road.//

**1-2:** I don&#39;t see them.

**1-1:** Command. Got anything?

**Command:** Negative but keep an eye out.  

**1-2:** Oh my god- (pants) he controls them! 

**1-1:** You still got the binder?

**1-2:** Yeah... Right here. (He lifts it and drops his arm back down.)

//A yellow light flashes and the car drifts before regaining control.//

**Command:** Don&#39;t look! Keep driving!

**1-1:** Why did it activate so soon?!

**Command:**  We don&#39;t know but just keep going. All the SCP-6631-1s are heading to it right now.

**1-2:** Thank god. Fuck this place!

After the remainder of Iota-12 returned, The Foundation halts its exploration for the time being. In the binder recovered by 1-2 were handwritten notes of SCP-6631-2 of unknown hieroglyphics. The sources of the notes are currently being cited and translated.

A week later, Director Manny Yin got an email sent from a computer located within Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic.

This is Lt. Dixon Mink of Iota-12. If anyone in the Foundation is reading this. I need your help. They got our weapons and used the 6631 cogintohazard. I played along but Kenny resisted. They killed him when they realized he wasn&#39;t converting. Julain is one of them now. I need to get out of here and get my amnestics quickly because I can feel myself slipping every day. I&#39;m scared. 

Please.

My first dream... I see this woman. I feel like I know her but I&#39;ve never met her. But every time I dream of her, she makes me so happy. So fulfilled. But suddenly, she looks at me with that face. That fucking face, like she&#39;s disgusted by me. And everything around me breaks apart and goes dark.

I see stars. Millions, probably trillions of them. But one by one, they start disappearing. And it happens so fast that even whole groups of stars disappear at the same time. Then there&#39;s nothing left. Nothing but me. I try to scream but there&#39;s no noise, I try to move but I can&#39;t. Like I&#39;m trapped in my own body if I have one. And every time, I always think that I&#39;m dead. Because that&#39;s what people say right when they got near-death experiences? That it&#39;s just nothing but darkness. But they always say like your sleeping. But I wasn&#39;t asleep, I was aware, and I couldn&#39;t &#39;t do anything but I tried and I tried and I tried to do anything but that was it. I was alone.

Last contact with Lt. Dixon Mink was a video recording received by Director Yin. Lt. Dixon Mink has since been declared Missing In Action.



[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Exploration Video Log Transcript**

//1-3 follows the rest of an SCP-6631-1 group with SCP-6631-2 to the farmhouse. SCP-6631-2 goes inside while the group stands and waits for two hours until he exits the some and the SCP-6631 instances follow. 1-3 stays behind and paces slowly so that they can be ahead of him. Soon I-3 stops and carefully walks backward as he still keeps his eyes on the group. When the group is far enough that they don&#39;t seem visible, I-3 runs to the farmhouse and enters it. He explores upstairs and searches every room but nothing of note catches his attention to stay. Except for when he enters the main bedroom and finds a framed photo of an old woman. He approaches the dresser it stands upon and inspects it.//

**1-3:** It&#39;s her... The woman in my dreams.

//1-3 places the frame back on the dresser and goes downstairs. He walks around the first floor and inspects every door to eventually find one that leads down a basement. He climbs down the stairs and switches on the basement lights, he looks around and finds a tunnel to his left. He enters the tunnel and walks for about three minutes until he finds an opening with a flickering light. He makes his way to the opening and in front of him is a decaying corpse of a woman being fused to a smooth, black surface that&#39;s the shape of an upside-down triangle with the same glowing glyph engraved on her torso. Resting below her corpse is a collection of decaying bodies and remnants of several human skeletons. The woman lifts her head at I-3 and moves her mouth as if she&#39;s trying to speak. She only moans but 1-3 responds to her as if she was speaking.//

**1-3:** I know who you are...but why are you doing this? (woman groans). Have you told him to stop? (Woman groans) Of course, but this... this is torture. For you, and these people, I&#39;ve seen it! (woman groans)  What? I... I don&#39;t know if I can... I don&#39;t know what it&#39;ll do... (Woman moans louder in pain) I&#39;m so sorry. I... Your husband.  I know his thoughts. I can&#39;t bring myself to do it. (woman screams) Okay! I will. I will do it. 

//1-3 goes back to the basement and opens the carbon monoxide gas tank while turning off the light switch. He makes his way back through the tunnel and back to the woman.// 

**1-3:** When he comes back and turns the lights on, this should explode. That&#39;s the best I can come up with... we&#39;re just gonna have to see. And if this doesn&#39;t work. I know people, who can maybe figure something out.  I have to go. I gotta show them this. 

//1-3 leaves the cave and back to the basement. He exits the house and runs to the forest to not be spotted by any nearby SCP-6631-1 instance. He pulls out his phone and types on the keyboard then suddenly drops to his knees, whipping his head back.//



**1-3:** I CAN&#39;T DO THIS ANYMORE, HAROLD! WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU CAN&#39;T?! I LIVED MY LIFE. YOU SHOULD HAVE LIVED YOURS TOO. MY LIFE IS NOTHING WITHOUT YOU. YOU ARE WRONG! THIS NEW LIFE IS NOTHING! I CAN&#39;T FEEL. I CAN&#39;T MOVE. I CAN&#39;T DO ANYTHING ANYMORE! BUT YOU ARE HERE NOW, ISN&#39;T THAT ENOUGH?! YOU HAVE TRAPPED ME AND THESE POOR PEOPLE... IN THIS BOTTOMLESS THING! I DID THIS ALL FOR YOU! NO MORE! NO MORE! I WANT TO BE FREE FROM THIS. I WILL BE FREE FROM THIS. DON&#39;T DO THIS TO ME, MARIAM! 

//1-3 plummets and pants heavily. He looks at the house and soon enough is swarmed by the SCP-6631-1 instances. They rush inside the house all at once, shoving and stepping on each other. A few minutes pass and suddenly the house explodes with the footage finally cutting to a blue screen.//

[[/div]] 


 
-----------

The Forward Operation Outpost dispatches SCPRD &#34;Athena to survey the last known position of I-3.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]


//Athena flies towards the smoke with the SCP-6631-1’s still trying to put it out. SCP-6631-2 is also seen on his knees watching what was once its home. The drone hovers over them while it scans for any activity of SCP-6631.//

//With no activity, Athena flies away to return to the compound. After three minutes of flying, a yellow light flashes and distorts the footage, as well as control of the drone. After regaining control, Athena turns in the direction of SCP-6631 in the air with footage disruption. Athena flies back to where the farmhouse was and all the SCP-6631-1 instances are digging through the rubble. SCP-6631-2 continues to watch, as more and more instances run to the field and aid the others.//

//Athena&#39;s microphone picks up loud screams and wailing of a woman coming from SCP-6631.//

[[/div]] 

Containment of SCP-6631 is currently being updated with a fifteen-foot concrete wall replacing the fence. Exploration past the containment zone has been prohibited until further notice.
