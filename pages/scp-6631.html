[[span style=&#34;color:gray&#34;]]**Special Containment Procedures:** The town of Willimantic, Connecticut is to be fenced off in 5km. Roads leading to all nearby towns are to be closed off and rerouted (refer to Protocol Shiva-7-1). Civilians who attempt to enter the five-kilometer exclusion zone around Willimantic will be detained and transported to Outpost-VI for questioning and Class-B amnestics. The area around Willimantic has been declared an official no-fly zone for all commercial and recreational aerocrafts. Any aeroplanes are to be cautioned of the $750,000 penalty for entering the restricted zone. Aeroplanes that disregard this warning are to be located and administered Class-B amnestics upon landing. Cover stories of chemical waste within the town are to be broadcasted.[[/span]]

**Updated Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6631 is to be held in a standard containment unit in Sub-Level 4 of Site-77. SCP-6631 is to be covered at all times with on-site guards stationed outside of the containment unit. Access to SCP-6631&#39;s containment unit is restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance who have undergone cognitohazardous resistance training.

-------------


**Description:** SCP-6631 is a 3-dimensional triangular obsidian monument, measuring 1.14m in height and 15cm in width. When deactivated, SCP-6631 illuminates a cognitohazardous light which influences victims to approach and reactivate the object. Once the victim reactivates SCP-6631, they become SCP-6631-A. 

SCP-6631-A is a singular entity that has made physical contact with SCP-6631, causing its lower body and forearms to fuse to the surface. SCP-6631-A increases its cognitohazardous reach via a yellow triangular glyph that appears 65-meters in the sky. The glyph emits a 32,000LM [[footnote]]A measurement of light equal to 806 meters.[[/footnote]] that converts witnesses into instances of SCP-6631-1. Additionally, it disrupts any nearby electronic device, potentially rendering them ineffective.


SCP-6631-1 designates a collection of organic entities that act as a collective consciousness for SCP-6631-A and SCP-6631-B. SCP-6631 emits a yellow light from their opened mouths and eyes. Becoming an SCP-6631 is caused by viewing SCP-6631-A&#39;s glyph and is instantaneous. As SCP-6631-1 instances as a vessel for SCP-6631-A and SCP-6631-B. Affected entities are incapable of acting independently and frequently starve themselves. SCP-6631-1&#39;s primary objective appears to be locating organic entities and converting them into other SCP-6631-1 instances.


SCP-6631-B designates an organic entity that has control over SCP-6631-1 instances without being fused to SCP-6631. Becoming an SCP-6631-B instance is unknown. SCP-6631-B can verbally command all SCP-6631 instances remotely. Despite retaining their sentience, there is speculation that SCP-6631-B instances are partially controlled by SCP-6631.

**Discovery:** In 2010, 172 people were reported missing across the state of Connecticut in the span of two months. No traces of the missing persons were found during the investigations spearheaded by local law enforcement. Once the public grew aware of the rising number of missing persons across the state of Connecticut, the Federal Bureau of Investigations were involved, but their findings were inconclusive. 

During the period of high missing persons cases, a satellite belonging to the multinational cable channel CNN captured footage of SCP-6631 located at the Pomeroy State Park Scenic Reserve. When Foundation Containment Teams were dispatched, they were approached by the Unusual Incidents Unit, who provided footage from a dashboard camera from a subject named Jerry Nicolson. A 26-year-old caucasian male who was affiliated with Parawatch. When Foundation gained access to his account, he made a post the week before his disappearance.

I hid in a corner of my closet when they came. there were loud thuds, glass breaking, and yellow lights through the cracks of my door. My parents and little brother screamed along with the other neighbors that those people took. It was early, like 3 am early. After a while, things got quieter and I went to see all of Liberty Hill empty. Houses busted in and wrecked like an earthquake hit. 

I got a police station from another town to come to pick me up and they asked a bunch of questions. There wasn&#39;t much for me to say, obviously. 

I gotta go back. I have to find them. Get to the bottom of this.

Wish me luck.

After the disappearance of Jerry Nicolson, UIU investigators found his abandoned car in the middle of the road. A large trail of blood followed this but no bodies were found. When Foundation personnel arrived at the scene, the UIU handed them a recovered dashboard camera.

**DATE:** 4/7/2010

-------------

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

//The time is 23:11. The headlights show the roads and trees passing by as the song &#34;Just the Way You Are&#34; by Bruno Mars plays on the radio. Jerry taps on the wheel with the song&#39;s beat until his phone rings. He turns the volume down and answers the call.//

**Jerry:** Hello...? Hey, what&#39;s up...? No, nothing yet... Yeah, I remember... What&#39;s your point...? Are you fucking serious..? No! Maybe they missed something... They don&#39;t know that! You don&#39;t know that!... What does that have to do with anything...? Wow, thanks...Look, I don&#39;t know what to tell you but if you&#39;re that worried, you should&#39;ve come with me... Then help me out, you think I wanna be here, at night with no one else for miles!? I&#39;m scared too, shit. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s out there, but they&#39;re still my parents... I bet you would do the same thing if you were in my shoes... I know... I will... Love you too. 

//He hangs up and tosses the phone on the passenger seat. He rolls down the window and rests his arm on it.//

//Extraneous footage removed. Recording resumes at 23:45. The car is parked on the side with Jerry urinating beside the car. Once he&#39;s finished he walks back to his car before snapping his head behind him.//

**Jerry:** Hello?

//Dashboard camera doesn&#39;t pick up any sound. Jerry takes a few steps closer to his car while still keeping his head towards the direction of where he heard the noise.//

**Jerry:** Hello? Is someone there?

//Jerry tilts his head and stands there for a couple of seconds until he rushes into his car and tries to turn on the ignition. A man with yellow light emanating from his eyes and mouth jumps on top of the hood and presses his body on the windshield. Jerry starts the car and drives, trying to shake off the man. The man punches the windshield in an attempt to break through as Jerry slams the brakes, causing the man to fly off the hood onto the road. Jerry accelerates and passes by him. Jerry is breathing heavily while trying to stabilize the car.//

**Jerry:** What the fuck!? What the fuck!? What the fuck!? Oh my God! Holy shit!

//He continues to drive for eight minutes until the dash camera shows him approaching a person. He slows down the car and dims the headlights to see them clearer. It&#39;s a woman, also possessing a yellow glow in her eyes and mouth. After a couple of seconds, a horde of people rush out of the woods to the car. Jerry drives backwards as the horde grows and begins to pursue him. The car shakes repeatedly and swivels to the right, crashing into a tree. As Jerry shifts the gears, the SCP-6631-1 instances surround and pile on top of the vehicle. They manage to significantly damage the windows and screen, but Jerry is able to plow through the crowd. The car shakes violently as the sound of crunching is recorded. Eventually, he makes his way out of the crowd. From above, lines and dots form in the sky, disrupting the footage.//

//The headlights shut off, and the car slows down until it comes to a complete stop. Audio of the car door opening and closing is heard. The camera continues to malfunction as Jerry walks out of the frame towards the glyph. 40 minutes later, other SCP-6631-1 instances are seen moving toward the glyph until it fades away within another hour.//

SCPRD &#34;Hermes&#34; was deployed on 06/11/2010 into the SCP-6631 exclusion zone in order to recover more information about the anomaly. 

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

//Hermes&#39; camera begins recording above the forest. Hermes&#39; camera tilts down and spots an SCP-6631-1 instance below. The SCP-6631-1 instance looks up at Hermes and attempts to grab the drone by repeatedly leaping at the machine. Hermes attempts to escape as more SCP-6631-1 instances begin pursuing it. Hermes ascends 243 meters above the ground for approximately 10 minutes before descending once SCP-6631-1 instances are no longer in sight. As Hermes continues, the camera captures a light appearing from the southeast. The camera turns and zooms in to capture SCP-6631-A&#39;s glyph before becoming distorted.//



//As Hermes approaches SCP-6631-A&#39;s glyph, the microphone picks up audio of a woman&#39;s screams increasing in volume. 17 minutes later, the glyph fades away and Hermes reaches the farmhouse it was floating above. Hermes spots several SCP-6631-1 instances entering the house. Hermes descends and circles the house, detecting no SCP-6631-1 instances as it scans the second floor. However, Hermes captures footage of several SCP-6631-1 instances on the first floor and is recalled back to Site-77.//

Foundation personnel was deployed to fence off the exclusion zone of all SCP-6631 activity. No traces of SCP-6631-1 instances were reported during the containment. The Foundation deployed Mobile Task Force Iota-12 (&#34;Woodlanders&#34;), with handpicked agents who had undertaken the A.I.M. Course. [[footnote]]Agents who completed the A.I.M. Course have been rendered unwavering against the majority of cognitohazardous anomalies[[/footnote]] 

On their return to Site-77, only two agents of Iota-12 were recovered, while the rest were deemed M.I.A. The following footage is as followed:

**Command:** Checking.

**1-1:** Check.

**1-2:** Green here.

**1-3:** Checkity check-check.

**1-4:** Check here.

**1-5:** Check.

**Command:** You are green Iota-12. Good luck. 

**1-1:** On me. 

//MTF-Iota 12 stops at Mansfield Middle School and enters the vicinity of SCP-6631 on foot.//

**1-1:** Alrighty, we&#39;re not sure when SCP-6631 activates, so keep your gear on. Stay frosty for any -1&#39;s, and you let us know as soon as you see one. We&#39;re not here for a fight. God knows how many people it has in its control. Am I clear?

**Iota-12:** Yes sir!

//Iota-12 hikes through Schoolhouse Brook Park for 10 minutes straight with no sightings of SCP-6631-1.//

**1-4:** Command, question.

**Command:** Go ahead.

**1-4:** Isn&#39;t it kinda weird that when we locked this place down, there hadn&#39;t been any -1&#39;s around?

**1-2:** Yeah, I second that. Hell, they could&#39;ve gotten through the fence at any time. 

**Command:** Acknowledged. We&#39;ll notify you if we see anything.

**1-4:** Copy.

//Iota-12 continues to wander the forest for twenty minutes without any SCP-6631-1 instance sightings.// 

**1-5:** Not that I&#39;m complaining, but, weirdly, we haven&#39;t seen any SCP-6631-1 instances.

**1-3:** Yeah, kinda giving me the heebee jeebies. 

**1-1:**  Command, how is it up there?

**Command:** No sign of any SCP-6631-1 instances nearby. 

**1-2:** God, imagine if they start popping out of the ground.

**1-3:** Well, it was nice knowing you guys. Imma head back. 

**1-1:** Lieutenant Mink.

**1-3:** Kidding Captain. 

**1-2:**  Hold up. Got one up ahead. 

//Iota-12 raise their guns and take cover in brush. An SCP-6631-1 instance is visible across from them, seemingly unaware of their presence. Iota-12 waits until the entity disappears from sight to exit the brush.// 

**1-2:** Should we follow it? It could lead us somewhere. 

**1-4:** Better than what we&#39;ve been doing.

**1-1:**  Command? Any other instances nearby?

**Command:** None so far.

**1-1:** Good to hear. When we follow this thing, 1-4 and 1-5, we will keep an eye on our six. 1-2 and 1-3, keep an eye on our sides. Got it?

**Iota-12:** Yes sir.

//Iota-12 follows the SCP-6631-1 instance for a few minutes and halts upon witnessing it enter a two-story house.//

**1-1:**  Command, SCP-6631-1 went inside a house. Should we proceed to follow it? 

**Command:** Affirmative. 

**1-1:** Copy. 4, You&#39;re with me. The rest of you, keep an eye out. 

//1-1n and 1-4 pick the door lock and make their way into the home. IOta-12&#39;s footsteps are muffled by the carpet. They sneak around the house, led by 1-1. The agents ascend up the stairs as footsteps from the ceiling are heard. The agents ready their rifles before entering, finding the SCP-6631-1 instance staring out the window.//

**SCP-6631-1:** Say something. Say something. I wanna hear your voice. Please. 

//1-1 closes the door and gestures 1-4 to the other door across. 1-4 opens the door carefully and sees another SCP-6631-1 instance.// 

**SCP-6631-1:** ...SAY SOMETHING!

//They both quietly leave the residency and regroup with the rest of the team.//

**1-5:** What happened in there?

**1-4:**  They&#39;re just standing there, talking to themselves. 

**1-3:** How many?

**1-1:** Just two more inside. 

**1-5:** So that&#39;s what they&#39;ve all been doing? Just nothing? But then why was that one walking around alone?

**1-4:** Maybe it was scouting.

**I-3:** Looked kinda depressed for a lookout. 

**1-1:**  Either way, this makes our job a little easier. Fingers crossed we get to the farmhouse with no trouble. Command, how far are we?

**Command:** Halfway there Iota. 

//After another 20 minutes of hiking, Iota-12 reaches the farmhouse. At this point, they are walking through an open field.// 

**Command:** Hold it.

**1-1:**  What is it?

**Command:** -1 instances are around the house. Probably more inside. 

**1-5:** So what&#39;s the plan?

**1-1:**  Gonna have to get all those -1&#39;s away from the house.

//Iota-12 remains silent.//

**1-5:** We could throw a frag. Have them investigate it.

**1-2:** We&#39;ll lose our element of surprise.

**1-3:** Think that was thrown out the window when we stepped foot on this field. 

**I-4:** Got any better ideas?

**1-3:** Actually, I do. I can circle the house and get their attention. Hopefully, I&#39;ll only get the ones by the house. But that should leave you guys a big enough window to get inside.

**1-1:** Absolutely not. If we&#39;re gonna do something, we do it together. Any other suggestions?

**1-3:** I&#39;m fast. I won two gold medals in track back in Uni. Used that to get away from an ex, so I think I&#39;ll make it.

**1-1:** I said no, so drop it.

**1-2:** I think we should let him.

**1-3:** Thank you.

**1-1:** We don&#39;t have the time for this.

**1-2:** Yeah, we don&#39;t. That&#39;s why we gotta do something now. And if he says he can do it, shit, let him. Means we don&#39;t have to hear his stupid ass jokes. 

**1-3:** Oh my god, you paid attention! That&#39;s more than what mommy and daddy will ever do for you. 

**1-1:** You swear you can make it?

**1-3:** Positive.

**1-1:** ... Fine. Just hold tight when you lose them, and make sure to pick up your walkie.

**1-3:** I got this, don&#39;t worry.

**1-2:** God, I can&#39;t wait for you to get caught. 

**1-3:** Love you too, Aidens.

//1-3 leaves the group. His feed shows him staying low from the SCP-6631-1 instances view. 4 minutes later, 1-3 fires his rifle in the air, and the SCP-6631-1 group runs in the direction of the gunfire. He runs to the woods and continues to fire his weapon. The rest of Iota-12 head to the house and prepare to breach. They look through the windows with nobody inside, tossing a flashbang bang inside before entering. They scout the first floor with no sign of human or anomalous activity. They ascend the stair leading to the second floor as they encountered a middle-aged man wielding a double-barreled shotgun. The farmer aims his weapon to 1-1.//

**Farmer:** Who the hell are you?

**1-1:**  We got an armed civilian!

**Farmer:** I said who are you!?

//1-1 backs up from the stairs with his weapon still aiming at the farmer.//

**1-1:** Sir, put your weapon down.

**Farmer:** I wanna know why you broke into my house, first.

//The rest of Iota-12 aim their rifles at the farmer as he is slowly walking down the stairs. The farmer eyes each member.//

**Farmer:** Am I under arrest? I didn’t do anything.

**1-1:** Sir, we just want to talk, but I need you to put your weapon away. 

**Farmer:** Tell you what. We can both put our guns against that wall by the door. And I mean ALL guns. Then we’ll talk.

//Silence//

**1-4:** Sir, he&#39;s just an old man. 

**1-1:** Doesn&#39;t matter. He&#39;s got his weapon on me.

//The farmer lowers the barrel and walks past them, placing his shotgun against the wall. After a couple of seconds, 1-1 lowers his rifle and places it on against the wall.//

**Farmer:** I did say ALL guns, mister.

//1-1 reluctantly removes his pistol and lays it on the floor. The rest of the team remove their weapons and sets them next to each other.//

**Farmer:** Now we can talk. 

//The farmer leads Iota-12 to his living room. They all have a seat on the couches.//

**Farmer:** Now, you mind telling me why you men broke into my home?

**1-1:** We didn&#39;t think anyone was inside. 

**Farmer:** Still doesn&#39;t answer my question. 

**1-1:** Well. Were you aware of those people surrounding your home?

**Farmer:** Them? Yeah, freaky little fellows, aren&#39;t they? What about &#39;em?

**1-1:** So do you know what&#39;s been happening?

**Farmer:** Son, I don&#39;t know what the Hell&#39;s happening, so you got some explaining to do. 

**1-2:** You notice their faces?

**Farmer:** Glowing eyes and shit, yeah, it&#39;s weird alright. I tried scaring them off but they wouldn&#39;t leave. But they never barged in either. 

**1-1:** Not even when you leave?

**Farmer:** Nope. They just stand there like a bunch of crackheads. 

**1-4:** Have you seen the news?

**Farmer:** I don&#39;t watch that anymore. Always showing all the bad stuff going on, y&#39;know.

**1-4:** Well sir, a lot of people went missing and those said missing people are apparently here. We want to find out why. 

**Farmer:** Hmm. Well, I&#39;m not sure what can I do to help.

**1-2:** You are. Just answering some of our questions will be more than enough. 

**Farmer:** Alright then. 

**1-5:** What&#39;s your name?

**Farmer:** Harold. 

**1-5:** Harold. Have you seen this, anywhere?

//1-5 shows Harold a photo of SCP-6631-A&#39;s glyph.//

**Harold:** I have, every now and then. 

**1-5:** Have you felt off when you did?

**Harold:** Nope. Never. 

**1-2:** Where have you seen it?

**Harold:** All over. Far. close. Even here. I&#39;ve tried going to it on several occasions but by the time I got there, it would either disappear or lead me to the middle of nowhere. Along with all the rest of these people. 

**1-1:** And you were still not affected by it, even when you were close to it?

**Harold:** That&#39;s right.

**1-1:** And the people still left you alone?

**Harold:** Yes. Honestly, I don&#39;t know what else to make of it. 

**1-4:** What can you tell us about your time here when it started?

**Harold:** Well... My wife has gotten sick and I was still trying to work on the harvest. I&#39;ve got a lot on my mind and am trying to do as much as I can here. But when I first saw it. The thing in the sky. Not gonna lie, I thought it was some new light show tech stuff or whatever that was happening. But then, after a few minutes, I saw people walking through my field, eyes, and mouths glowing. I was creeped out. But they paid no attention to me. So I hunkered in my house and waited it out. At some point, a group would stay here and not leave until the thing showed up. 

**1-1:**  Why haven&#39;t you left yet?

**Harold:** I can&#39;t leave my wife here. Especially when the doctors are probably walking around with the rest of them. I have to be the one to take care of her 24/7. 

**1-5:** Did you try contacting anyone?

**Harold:** I did. Numerous times. Nothing seems to work. 

//Harold leans forward and covers his forehead.//

**Harold:** I honestly don&#39;t know what else to do. I&#39;ve tried everything but...

**1-2:** Has your wife seen the glyphs in the sky?

**Harold:** No. She&#39;s asleep most of the time. 

**1-1:** Do you mind if we speak to her?

**Harold:** I absolutely do mind. She&#39;s going through too much as it is, and I don&#39;t want her to be in any panic. 

**1-1:** We can help you, and your wife. 

**Harold:** How?

**1-1:** We can escort you both out of here and get her to a hospital. But you might need to come with us.

**Harold:** Why me?

**1-1:** If what you&#39;re saying is true. Then maybe you can help us with this.

**Harold:** I don&#39;t know. 

**1-1:** My men can&#39;t stay here. One of mine is risking his life out there just for us to have this conversation. I&#39;m sorry Harold, but I&#39;m not asking you. 

**Harold:** Can I at least let my wife know what&#39;s going on? 

**1-1:** Yes, you can. 

//Harold stands from his chair and walks over the stairs. He climbs up and his footsteps are heard from above, as well as a door closing.//

**1-1:** 1-3, are you still with us? 

//Static noises.//

**1-1:** Mink, are you there?

//Static noises.//

**1-1:** Motherf- Command.

**Command:** Copy 1-1.

**1-1:** Any visual on 1-3?

**Command:** 1-3 retreated to a building with the SCP-6631-1 instances on his tail. Neither had come out yet. 

**1-1:** Shit, he&#39;s that far?

**Command:** What&#39;s your status?

**1-1:** We got two civilians. Elderly couple. One is a sick woman who needs medical attention ASAP. The husband seems to be immune to the cognitohazard, and has not been approached by the SCP-6631-1 instances. Although, we&#39;re still not sure why a handful of them was standing around his house. 

**Command:** Acknowledged. I&#39;d recommend you get out of there ASAP.

**1-1:** Copy that. Though the wife might be difficult. 

**Command:** I will leave you to it. Stay safe.

**1-1:** Understood. 

//1-1 stands up and walks to get his rifle and pistol than to the stairs.//

**1-1:** Harold! It&#39;s time to go!

**Harold:** Just give me a second!

//1-1 climbs up the stairs.//

**1-1:** We&#39;ll figure something out with your wife, but we need to get moving! Harold!

//I-2 follows I-1, gesturing for the others to stand by. 1-4 and 1-5 grab their rifles and pistols. 1-1 creep through the halls, knocking on the first door.//

**1-1:** Harold? 

//1-1 opens the door to see a small white bathroom.//

**1-1:** We don&#39;t have time for games, man. Come out. 

//1-1 opens the closet door filled with jackets and shirts.//

**1-2:** What&#39;s taking so long?

**1-1:** Something isn&#39;t right. Cover me. 

//1-1 moves to the next door while 1-2 is catching up to him. He stops and looks at the bottom of the closet and sees a binder with straight, angular lines. He crouches and takes it out, revealing the cover to be the same symbol as the glyph of SCP-6631.//

**1-2:** Captain, hold up! 

//He rushes to 1-1, showing him the binder.//

**1-2:** Look at this. 

**1-1:** Shit. Hold onto it. Harold! 

//1-1 opens the bedroom door, with nobody inside. They see a wide-open window and investigate the room. 1-1 sees a fire escape and then Harold who’s running across the field.//

**1-1:** He’s making a run for it!

//1-1 and 1-2 rush through the hallway and down the stairs.//

**1-1:** Let’s go! 

//1-1 opens the door and chases Harold with 1-2 behind him. 1-4 and 1-5 quickly grab their weapons and join up with them.//

**1-4:** Command! We got a runner, making a break for the woods.

**Command:** What happened in there?

**1-2:** I got myself a binder that can probably tell us more about this place. It was in his closet. He knows something about it.

**Command:** Copy. Take him in.

**1-4:** Any sign of 1-3?

**Command:** Negative. What of the wife?

**1-1:** Couldn’t find her. 

**Command:** Understood. I see SCP-6631-1 instances ahead.

//SCP-6631-1 emerges out from the trees and toward Harold.//

**Harold:** Get them!

//The SCP-6631-1 instances run past him towards Iota-12. The team raises their weapons and opens fire as another group of SCP-6631-1 instances emerge from the woods. The squad retaliate, shooting the incoming SCP-6631-1 instances. Harold slows down and turns around with the team eventually catching up to him. Harold [[footnote]]Hereafter referred to as SCP-6631-B.[[/footnote]] pants and looks at Iota-12 with yellow glowing eyes and the glyph forming behind the head.//

**1-1:** Command, he’s one of them.

**Command:** Stay alert.

//Iota-12 aims their rifles at SCP-6631-B.//

**1-1:** Get on the ground now!

**SCP-6631-B:** It was you wasn’t it? The big fence and all. 

**I-2:** Hands up and on the ground!

//SCP-6631-B stands up straight, staring at the MTF.//

**1-1:** What did you do to this place!?

//SCP-6631-B does not respond. 1-5 approaches SCP-6631-B at an arm&#39;s distance.//

**SCP-6631-B:** You boys should’ve left us be.

**1-4:** We got contact on our Southeast side!

//A large group of SCP-6631-1 instances runs towards Iota-12. 1-5 grabs SCP-6631-B and throws it down.//

**1-5:** Call them off!

**1-2:** We gotta get out of here!

//1-5 shakes SCP-6631-B violently and shoves his barrel at its temple.//

**1-5:** I said call them off!

**Command:** Iota-12, there’s a horde of SCP-6631-1 instances on your way. Get a move on.

**I-3:** What about Dixon?

**Command:** Still no sign of him. I’m sorry, but you need to get out while you can.

**1-1:** Fucking Christ! Let’s go!

**1-5:** What about this one?!

**1-1:** Forget it, now come on!

//1-5 takes his gun away from SCP-6631-B, and the rest of the team runs up north.//

**Command:** You got several SCP-6631-1 instances up ahead.

//Iota-12 aim their weapons and fire at the incoming SCP-6631-1 instances. They make their way through the forests and continue their escape. After a few minutes of running, they notice other SCP-6631-1 instances running from their sides. As 1-4 shoots an SCP-6631-1 instance, he glances behind him to see the growing horde that&#39;s been pursuing the squad. 1-4 faces forward, colliding with a tree.//

**1-5:** Julian!

//1-5 stops and runs back to 1-4. He slides next to him and tries to pick him up while scrambling to do the same.//

**1-5:** Come on! Stand up!

//1-4 tries to stand but when he takes a step, he tumbles back down. 1-5 clings to him to give him support.//

**1-1:** Where are you guys!?

**1-5:** Mowery got knocked out. I went back for him.

**1-1:** You need to hurry up, we&#39;re almost out of here!

//1-5 throws 1-4 onto his back and jogs.//

**1-5:** Come on. Come on. Come on. You got this. 

//Within 20 seconds, SCP-6631-1 instance tackles 1-5 and 1-4. 1-5 aims his rifle and begins firing at the horde before being overwhelmed.// 

**1-5:** (muffling) Get the fuck off me!

//A few seconds later, they disperse and pick 1-5 and 1-4. 1-5 struggles to escape while 1-4 remains limp. 1-1 and 1-2 make it back to Mansfield Middle School before rushing to get back inside their vehicle. 1-1 takes the driver&#39;s seat while 1-2 goes in the back. 1-1 starts the vehicle and accelerates onto the main road.//

**1-2:** I don&#39;t see them.

**1-1:** Command. Got anything?

**Command:** Negative but keep an eye out.  

//1-2 pants.//

**1-1:** You still got the binder?

**1-2:** Yeah... Right here. 

//He lifts it and drops his arm back down. Suddenly, their camera violently spins from a collision. Their vehicle stops and footage capture a white pick-up truck against the side.//

**Command:** 1-1 and 1-2! Respond!

//Silence//

**Command:** 1-1 and 1-2! Re-... Oh, hell.

//1-3 exits the pick-up truck with his pistol in hand, now an SCP-6631-1 instance. It opens the door to the driver&#39;s seat but is knocked down by 1-1. He rushes out of the car and disarms SCP-6631-1. 1-1 holds SCP-6631-1 down on the ground as 1-2 sees the two on the ground through the broken window.//

**1-2:** Dixon?

**1-1:** Paul, I need you to take the car and drive! 

**1-2:** But-

**1-1:** I SAID FUCKING GO!

//1-2 crawls onto the driver&#39;s seat and activates the engine. 1-2 drives away as 1-1 and SCP-6631-1 wrestle with one another.//

**SCP-6631-1:** You know this doesn&#39;t change anything for you, right?

**1-1:** (grunts) He&#39;ll make it. 

**SCP-6631-1:** Like your boy here? 

//1-1 hurls SCP-6631-1 down and picks himself back up. He draws his pistol and aims it at SCP-6631-1. It does not engage.//

**SCP-6631-1:** Go ahead. Shoot. 

**1-1:** What are you?

**SCP-6631-1:** I&#39;m just a guy. Trying to do what&#39;s best. You understand, right? 

**1-1:** When I get my hands on you. I&#39;m gonna fucking kill you, freak.

**SCP-6631-1:** Me? Or them?

//The horde of SCP-6631-1 surrounds the pair. He is restrained by the entities before he can retaliate. 11 minutes later, the glyph of SCP-6631-A appears and the SCP-6631-1 instances force 1-1 to look at it. Both 1-1&#39;s body cam feed and commands drone feed get disrupted and cuts off.//

I don&#39;t know what to do anymore. It&#39;s like everything I do is a waste. I&#39;m not ready to let go. I don&#39;t want to be. Lord, give me something. Help me save my Mariam. And I will forever, and ever be in your debt. 

Just give me something. Anything.

A bright flash of light and a loud boom woke me up. Mariam was gone. I rushed out of the house and into the truck to find her. That&#39;s when I saw this thing in the sky. And I just went straight to it, no hesitation. I don&#39;t know why, but, I heard her scream. God, she sounded like she was being skinned alive. She was calling for me. She needed me. I see a crater, and below I see this weird, black triangle glowing yellow. And Mariam... Her legs... her hands... just gone. I went over to help her. I touched the thing and I felt like me again, but, not at the same time?

I don&#39;t know but I heard her thoughts, and she mine. Then these other folk show up. Glowing faces and all. They all went to her as I did, but instead, they just disappeared. A quick flash of light then poof. Gone. As they kept doing this. I felt stronger. I felt more connected with Mariam. 

Is this it? Has God answered my prayers?

I can see and hear everything now. Everything that goes on here in this town. Like right now, I&#39;m on top of a hill overlooking the horizon, while I hear the horns of cars. I say I&#39;m thirsty, and all these things come in packs with bottles of water, juices, and all sorts of drinks. 

Mariam doesn&#39;t need any of that though. She&#39;s fine just the way she is. Perfect and beautiful. 

That&#39;s a lie, actually. She does need her energy. I need to do something about that. And quick. 


[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]
We had a fight. She says she wants me to take her out of it. Like hell, I&#39;m saving you! You should be thanking me instead of being an ungrateful-

No. Don&#39;t even go there. 

Doesn&#39;t matter now. I know what she needs. More energy. Yeah. That&#39;ll be good, right? Little apology gift. 


[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]
I&#39;ve been seeing things lately. Not the things that my people see. But-

Lemme start at the beginning. At first, it was just dreams. Little things that I could barely remember. But I would always see the stars. Beautiful little things, twinkling in the dark. And then, nothing. Just empty blackness. 

After a while, the dreams became more frequent. And I could remember them a bit more clearly than the last. I see a world. A torn world. Ripped inside and out until it looks like a husk. I see these things. They look like...Spiders? I don&#39;t know, but they had lots of arms and legs. 

Anyway, I see one that&#39;s infused with the triangle, much like Mariam. I see, hundreds, maybe thousands of others like it working on a massive ark. I feel hungry and thirsty. And it&#39;s like my body is tearing up. But... We have to leave. And we have to leave soon. 



[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]
The light isn&#39;t bright enough. And even when it moves, it&#39;s still not enough. I gotta go further out. Passed Willimantic. Doesn&#39;t help that we&#39;re miles from any other town. But I&#39;ll make it work. I have to. 

For Mariam. 


[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]
The Ark is almost complete. I only hope that we have enough to fuel it and The Korto Stone. Kaniska and the others should be back soon with the coordinates for our new home. Qanu is not doing well. I could offer more slaves to him but we would be low on construction. That kind of resources and time cannot be wasted. Qanu, just hold on for a little longer. We will all survive this apocalypse. 


[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]
I&#39;ve got a good number today. But numbers ran thin. I&#39;m closing into Liberty Hill and Mansfield Center. I  need to really think of a plan of attack. 3 or 4 a.m. Sounds like a good enough time. I need lots of zip ties, rope, and gags. Anything and everything to keep them still and quiet until we get them back in Willimantic. 

It&#39;s a lot... But it&#39;s okay. Just think of it like it&#39;s your farm. Just bigger. You got this, Harold. 

But enough about me. I need to get Mariam somewhere safe. Safe and cozy... Harold, you&#39;re a fucking __genius!__

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]
Oh my God! That was a little harder than I&#39;d thought. But we did it! I got her here, with me. Now I&#39;ll just need to take extra measures for when they leave for tonight. I&#39;ll leave 30 slaves here on guard while the rest head for Liberty Hill. You are gonna eat good, Mariam! 


[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]

They found us! We must leave now! 

Kaniska... He told them... I should have used the stone on you when I had the chance! No matter. You wish for your death than salvation? You wish to side with the very people that destroyed our home? So be it! I will not die. No, I will thrive in our new home. I will rebuild it from the ground up. I will be a just ruler of my people. And I will care for the new home I have made, unlike our pathetic Emporer. 

I

WILL

**__THRIVE!__**


[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]
A stray comet struck our port side. 

Everything is gone. The light is not bright enough for anyone to see. 

I see my brother, Mikuul. The one who cared for me when I fused with The Korto. The one who always cared for me before that. Floating away from me, as I try to breathe. 

I see stars. Beautiful little things, twinkling in the dark. 

They fade. Until there is nothing but black.

**Addendum-4: Capt. Duke Odum**



A week later, all SCP-6631-1 instances had lost their anomalous properties and had reverted to non-anomalous humans. Class-A amnestics were administered to the civilians and Foundation personnel evacuated the area under the guise of the National Guard. 2 days later, Foundation personnel entered the farmhouse and recovered SCP-6631 and all missing MTF Iota-12 agents. The events leading to the deactivation of SCP-6631 were captured in Capt. Odum&#39;s body camera.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**



//The log begins recording at 12:22. Odum walks through the branches, making no attempts to create a clear path. Eventually, he sees a river and follows it downstream. He continues for half an hour before coming across an SCP-6631-1 instance. The entity was originally a small boy, now suffering from malnutrition and various cuts and bruises. The entity continues moving, unfazed by its injuries.//

//Odum begins to follow but eventually stops. Odum continues walking downstream for another 40 minutes until it leads to a highway. There are cars scattered over the road, the doors of which are left ajar. Odum makes his way onto the road and turns right. He walks for an additional 20 minutes before coming across a University in a neighborhood.//

//Odum&#39;s camera records several other SCP-6631-1 instances, all of which seem to be suffering from malnutrition. Odum passes the SCP-6631-1 instances, as they make their way to their next destination. Odum spots 1-4 among the crowd.//




//Odum wanders through the campus, eventually finding himself in front of a Student Center. He looks to his left and notices a shattered window. He crawls through the opening and walks until he finds a café. Odum finds a bottle of water, vocalizes, and drops to his knees as he starts to drink. He coughs and sees several bags of varying chip brands. He snatches a few Dorito bags, rips them open, and eats the entirety of the contents. He consumes several other foods stored at the café before falling asleep. Odum appears to wake up 7 hours later. He heads to the front desk with a dolly register to keep him supported. He climbs over, sits on the rolling chair, and tries to use the computer. He does this for a few minutes before stopping.//


**Odum:** Right. No electricians. 

//Odum takes his radio from his shoulder.//

**Odum:** Command?

//Silence.//

**Odum:** Command? Can you hear me?

//Silence.//

**Odum:** Great.

//A bright yellow light is seen causing Odum to jump. he hides underneath the desk and looks at the wall. After an hour of waiting, the yellow light dims and disappears. Odum peaks from the desk, scanning for any signs of SCP-6631-1 instances. None are seen nearby.// 

**Odum:** Fuck it.

//Odum climbs over the desk and uses the dolly to walk to the broken window. He exits and slowly walks to the road. He follows it for approximately 15 minutes before stopping at the forest. Crunching leaves and snapping branches are heard throughout the footage for 40 minutes. Eventually, Odum is back at the farmhouse field, alongside several SCP-6631-1 instances. SCP-6631-B can be seen at the head of the group.//


 

//Odum joins the SCP-6631-1 instances and follows SCP-6631-B to the farmhouse. SCP-6631-B goes inside while the SCP-6631-1 instances stand and wait for 2 hours until SCP-6631-B exits. SCP-6631-B leads the majority of SCP-6631-1 instances away from the house Odum stays behind and begins to lag behind the group. Once the horde is out of sight, Odum turns around and enters the house. He explores upstairs and searches each room but nothing catches his attention. until he enters the main bedroom. He approaches a nearby dresser and inspects a framed picture of an old woman.//

**Odum:** It&#39;s her… The woman in my dreams.

//Odum places the frame back on the dresser and goes downstairs. He walks around the first floor and inspects every door to eventually find one that leads down to a basement. He descends the stairs and switches on the basement lights, locating a tunnel to his left. He enters the tunnel and walks for about 3 minutes until he finds an opening with a flickering light. He makes his way to the opening and finds a decaying corpse of a woman. The corpse is fused to a smooth, black surface the shape of an upside-down triangle, and has the same glowing glyph engraved on the torso. Collections of decayed bodies and remnants of countless skeletons rest below. SCP-6631-A lifts its head to Odum and moves its mouth as if it is trying to speak.//

**SCP-6631-A:** Duke... Odum...

**Odum:** Mariam?

**SCP-6631-A:** You... Haven&#39;t fully... turned.

**Odum:** Let me go. Please.

**SCP-6631-A:**  Not... yet. I... Need you.

**Odum:** What can I do that other of your instances can&#39;t?

**SCP-6631-A:** Harold knows all... I&#39;ve been trying.... to not use the light... but I feel hungry... thirsty. I&#39;m... Sorry. But as long as I don&#39;t use the light... As long as I stay silent... He doesn&#39;t know what I&#39;m thinking... But for you... it&#39;s different... You resist... He doesn&#39;t see... what you see... or hear what you hear. 

**Odum:** Not for long. I can feel myself slipping. My body moves on its own, even when my legs are aching. 

**SCP-6631-A:** Yes... But do not worry... I will only use the light...one last time...

//They glow from SCP-6631-A&#39;&#39;s eyes become brighter.//

**SCP-6631-A:** Take your gun... Shoot me, Odum.

**Odum:** I- I don&#39;t want to.

**SCP-6631-A:**  Do it... They&#39;re on their way.

**Odum:** Mariam... my love...

**SCP-6631-A:** Take... your... gun.

//Odum draws his pistol and begins shaking as he aims at its head.//

**Odum:** Mariam, what are you doing?! Stop!

**SCP-6631-A:** Pull... the trigger.

**Odum:** No, no, no ,no, no, no ,no, no, no, no!

**SCP-6631-A:** Do it.

//Odum lowers his gun.//

**SCP-6631-A:** SHOOT! 

//A flash of yellow light envelops the footage before a gunshot is heard. The light vanishes and Odum is on the ground hyperventilating. Odum manages to control his breathing after a few minutes. SCP-6631-A&#39;a decayed body crumbles to dust, leaving SCP-6631 in almost pristine condition, minus the bullet that has dug deep inside the object. Odum stands and flees the tunnel system. He rushes out from the basement to the front of the porch, where he finds a crowd of people laying on the ground. Everyone appears disoriented or in pain, but the majority of them are conscious, alive, and no longer exhibiting anomalous properties.//

//Odum sits on the porch.//

Capt. Odum was recovered and kept under medical supervision for 2 weeks. On-site psychologist Dr. Fisk Lasso had to evaluate Capt. Odum&#39;s condition due to prolonged exposure to SCP-6631&#39;s influence.

**Interviewed:** Capt. Duke Odum

**Interviewer:** Dr. Fisk Lasso

-----------

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Dr. Lasso:** How are you feeling today, captain?

//Odum remains silent as he clasps his hands and begins to shake.//

**Dr. Lasso:** Captain?

**Odum:** Huh? Oh, uh. I&#39;m good. 

**Dr. Lasso:** You&#39;re shaking.

**Odum:** Oh. I mean-...

**Dr. Lasso:** There&#39;s no shame in being honest. You&#39;re safe. 

**Odum:** It&#39;s just that I&#39;m realizing a lot of things.

**Dr. Lasso:** Like what?

**Odum:** For starters, the -1&#39;s we shot. Outside looking in, it&#39;s no big deal. Like, you saw, they were the ones after us. 

**Dr. Lasso:** Yes?

**Odum:** But actually being one of them. They didn&#39;t know what was going on. They were literally just people. 

**Dr. Lasso:** But you have killed people before, yes?

**Odum:** Other soldiers, bandits, pirates. They knew what they were doing and what they got themselves into. But these were just... normal people. And I killed them.

**Dr. Lasso:** You defended yourself, captain.

**Odum:** Sure.

**Dr. Lasso:** Is there anything else on your mind?

**Odum:** Mariam...

**Dr. Lasso:** The one fused to SCP-6631?

//Odum nods.//

**Odum:** It&#39;s hard to put into words. When you got no control over your own body. But I wanted so badly to just lay down and never wake up. My legs were tearing apart with every step I took And when I found Mariam. When she told me to-... Excuse me for a moment.

//Odum remains silent.//

**Odum:** It was like I shot my own wife, man. When -2 spoke through me, begging her to stop. For some reason, my brain just imagined Penelope in her place. I don&#39;t know if it was the hivemind shit or my sleep deprivation but... Jesus Christ. 

**Dr. Lasso:** But you didn&#39;t kill your wife. 

//Pause//

**Odum:** I think we all felt it. That desperation. That second chance to try. And that split-second shock before SCP-6631 deactivated. 

//Pause//

**Odum:** I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know.

**Dr. Lasso:** Would you like us to give you some amnestics?

**Odum:** Not now. Maybe not for a while. I feel like I shouldn&#39;t forget.

**Dr. Lasso:** Is there anything you would like?

**Odum:** I think I just wanna go home for a while. 

**Dr. Lasso:** I&#39;ll see what I can do.


**&lt;End Log&gt;**
