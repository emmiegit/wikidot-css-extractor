**Item №:** SCP-4736

**Anomaly Class:** Thaumiel-numen[[footnote]] Antiquated Divinity-Type subclass repurposed out of respect for the deceased. [[/footnote]]

**Object Class:** Decommissioned (Informal)

**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment has been rendered unnecessary by Operation Astaroth. The corpse once held by Foundation High Command is now buried in an Arizonan field per the deceased&#39;s request.

Previous containment procedures have been supplanted in the wake of Operation Astaroth. Give your thanks to the deceased and then depart.

**Description:** The deceased[[footnote]]Hereafter cataloged as SCP-4736 out of formality.[[/footnote]] was a Class-V Manufactured Theo-Weapon of transhuman origin. Its last will and testament indicate that it answered to the name &#34;Robin&#34; and was aged twenty-four[[footnote]] Standard Sol-revolution year. [[/footnote]] upon death. However, this information was rendered inaccurate upon its creation.

SCP-4736 had access to vast energies[[footnote]] Gamma-type controlled power emissions; baseline for Class-V Theo-Weapons produced in the modern era. [[/footnote]] while under Foundation custody as a result of its inextricable self-relation. This self-relation extended to all aspects of its intersection with hyper-conceptual reality (AKA the Infosphere, the post-dormant Noosphere, the aggregate deific realm), rendering all attempted metaphysical assaults ineffective so long as SCP-4736 understood itself to be immune.

Per accepted workings of forced apotheosis, SCP-4736&#39;s previous identity was retroactively purged from hyper-conceptual reality and repurposed into a weapon useful to the Foundation. Following the implementation of a [[[SCP-2578 | hypnestic]]][[footnote]] An injection-based method of altering and manipulating human thought. [[/footnote]]-loaded subdermal [[[SCP-1463|auto-injector]]][[footnote]] Dose Alpha-Cameo; baseline for Class-V Theo-Weapons produced in the modern era. [[/footnote]], it performed certain actions guided by Foundation Central Control such that Operation Astaroth became feasible.

Accolades have been rendered unnecessary by Operation Astaroth. The following remain unawarded to the deceased:

* Foundation Medal of Honor (Bravery, Accomplishment, Control)
* Foundation Consolation for Theft of Human Goodness (Irreversible)
* General human recognition/appreciation (Rendered unnecessary)
* Foundation Recognition of Theocide (First Class)

**{{PERSONNEL INVOLVED:}}** SCP-4736, Sr. Researcher [[[SCP-4260 | Preston Bracks]]] (SiteCommand)

**{{STATION:}}** Site-873

**{{PURPOSE:}}** The necessity of the operation was confirmed by Overwatch Command on May 26, 2005, in order to achieve optimal containment. During the initial stages of the operation, SCP-4736 was housed within Site-873&#39;s Medical Bay. A paratechnological scrying-tool was utilized to view its surroundings once it escaped baseline reality; its remains stayed unmoving within Site-873.

[[div class=&#34;dialogue&#34;]]
**SiteCommand:** Greetings, SCP-4736. You have a job to do.

**SCP-4736:** A job?

**SiteCommand:** It does not benefit you to lie. If you continue, the operation will have to be postponed.
[[/div]]

**[00:01]** //FOOL-Grade hypnestic injected. Subject develops cognition-dependent immunity to conceptual jamming; Site-873 sustains minor conceptual damage for the duration.//

[[div class=&#34;dialogue&#34;]]
**SiteCommand:** Look at the ground next to your bed. You have been supplied with a firearm, a flashlight, and a dictionary of expanded vocabulary; please determine which you wish to take.

**SCP-4736:** I don&#39;t know that word — &#34;firearm&#34;?

**SiteCommand:** A weapon.

**SCP-4736:** I&#39;ll... I&#39;ll take the dictionary, I guess. Is that alright?
[[/div]]

**[00:02]** //SiteCommand confers with attending personnel regarding subject&#39;s unsatisfactory decision. The operation is allowed to continue.//

[[div class=&#34;dialogue&#34;]]
**SCP-4736:** Listen, if you want me to take the weapon or the flashlight, I can do that.

**SiteCommand:** Incorrect. The choice has been made, and you do not live in a world without consequences.

**SCP-4736:** Can I, uh, speak with someone else? I feel like I need some clarification on what I&#39;m doing here.

**SiteCommand:** All complaints should have been filed before the operation began. Now, you have a job to do.
[[/div]]

**[00:03]** //The operation proper begins. Site-873&#39;s scrying-tool indicates that subject is transported to the FIRST GATE, equipped with a Foundation-issue Merriam-Webster dictionary. Ironworks and labors of absurdity rise before her into an acrid sky. The GATE and its wall are damaged irreparably  — inoperabilities rent into firmament beyond. Before her stand two AVIAN-Type Astaroth-Obstructors, dressed in soldiers&#39; garb.//

//The leftmost guardian speaks, its words unobstructed by its faux bird-mask.//

[[div class=&#34;dialogue&#34;]]
**Guardian-1:** Ah, another one sent from the Deep. Shall we test its personhood, friend?

**Guardian-2:** Yes, yes, show her &#39;round!

**Guardian-1:** Hmm... a blank slate once again. Yet more dead weight; pitiful creature.

**Guardian-2:** No memories to her name? Twirly-bird! Gate-stopper!

**Guardian-1:** Take up arms, my compatriot. We will dispatch this one with haste.
[[/div]]

**[00:04]** //Both AVIAN-Type Astaroth-Obstructors unsheath halberds of fluctuating steel. SiteCommand remains unaffected.//

[[div class=&#34;dialogue&#34;]]

**SiteCommand:** Of course.
[[/div]]

**[00:05]** //MAGICIAN-Grade hypnestic injected. Subject&#39;s form becomes intolerable to both AVIAN-Type Astaroth-Obstructors. Post-injection, they immolate before her; the halberds drop to the ground, useless.//

**SCP-4736:** Shit!

**SiteCommand:** Check your soul, SCP-4736.

[[div class=&#34;dialogue&#34;]]
**SCP-4736:** So, um, what&#39;s my purpose here? Are you going to keep injecting me with whatever that stuff is?

**SiteCommand:** You were informed of your purpose before the operation&#39;s initiation.

**SCP-4736:** I just... I don&#39;t think I understand what&#39;s happening.

**SiteCommand:** Would you like to file for clarity of purpose?

**SCP-4736:** I guess? Do I need to fill out a form?

**SiteCommand:** The question confuses us. Look to the steel-spike structure at your right.
[[/div]]

**[00:07]** //Subject approaches the structure and notes lettering inscribed on its base.//

[[div class=&#34;dialogue&#34;]]
**SCP-4736:** I see words! Did you write them?

**SiteCommand:** No. They have existed since long before our organization.

**SCP-4736:** &#34;Mail a letter to Site-001 requesting information about the ongoing Operation.&#34; And then some black boxes, but then it says... &#34;No mail sent to Site-001 will be recognized.&#34;

**SiteCommand:** Is there a problem?

**SCP-4736:** Why does it say two different things here? Oh, wait... are these two different forms? Which one am I supposed to follow?

**SiteCommand:** The question confuses us.
[[/div]]

**[00:08]** //Subject steps back and notes that the inscriptions continue the entire length of the steel-spike structure.//

[[div class=&#34;dialogue&#34;]]
**SCP-4736:** Are these all... different forms?

**SiteCommand:** In order to prevent knowledge of clarity from being leaked, several/no false files have been created alongside the true file/files. Revealing the true nature/natures of clarity to the general public is cause for execution, except as required under ████-███-██████.

**SCP-4736:** Those weren&#39;t words. You just spoke static to me.

**SiteCommand:** Complaints will not be accepted at this time.

**SCP-4736:** Can&#39;t I just... hold on.
[[/div]]

**[00:09]** //Subject removes her dictionary, and flips to the &#34;C&#34; section.//

[[div class=&#34;dialogue&#34;]]
**SCP-4736:** There we go, I&#39;ve got it right here. &#34;Clarity of purpose; noun-phrase: a clearly stated purpose.&#34;

**SiteCommand:** Correct.

**SCP-4736:** That&#39;s unhelpful.

**SiteCommand:** You were wrong to expect anything else. Such a useless endeavor.

**[00:35]** //Subject proceeds through the landscape of thorns. The journey is long and tedious, without significant progress. Her hands begin to twitch.//

[[div class=&#34;dialogue&#34;]]
**SCP-4736:** Hello? Something&#39;s wrong. This isn&#39;t a complaint.

**SiteCommand:** Is it an objection?

**SCP-4736:** How is that any different from... Yes. An objection.

**SiteCommand:** Then conceptual integrity has begun to deteriorate. Run.
[[/div]]

**[00:43]** //Subject hesitates before beginning to sprint through the landscape. A hill becomes visible on the horizon, upon which rests a wall several kilometers deep.//

**[00:44]** //Subject halts abruptly, still several leagues from the SECOND GATE.//

[[div class=&#34;dialogue&#34;]]
**SiteCommand:** Explain yourself.

**SCP-4736:** There&#39;s something standing right in front of me but I can&#39;t see it.

**SiteCommand:** MANOS-Type Astaroth-Obstructor noted. It seems reality has begun to fail; we are doing very good work. Proceed forward.

**SCP-4736:** What the fuck is wrong with you? I just said I can&#39;t move.

**SiteCommand:** Please remain professional. Your words will be recorded for generations to come.

**SCP-4736:** Professional? Bureaucratic assholes — alright, I&#39;ll speak your language. I&#39;d like to file an objection against whatever&#39;s in front of me.

**SiteCommand:** Are you certain? Such an action would be highly praised by the Ethics Committee.

**SCP-4736:** Ethics Co... forget it. Yes. Inject me with something.

**SiteCommand:** That would be ill-advised. Procedures overridden and protocols ignored: Tier-VI entity introduced into Tier-I.

Given that Central Control was the dissenting party, the proposal is denied. SiteCommand defers to Regional Oversight; communication is accidentally delivered to the incorrect region and discarded.

**[04:14]** – **[16:22]** SiteCommand leaves Site-873 to travel directly to Regional Command, presumably to terminate the SCP-4736 operation. SiteCommand navigates to the 23rd floor of the facility and submits his proposal; however, the paperwork is destroyed immediately afterwards due to an ongoing catastrophic containment failure. This containment failure began as a result of the SCP-4736 project, which SiteCommand is forced to return to.

SiteCommand defers to the Overseer Council.

SiteCommand is eventually turned back. The reasons are unclear and irrelevant; the SCP-4736 project was never going to be stopped.
