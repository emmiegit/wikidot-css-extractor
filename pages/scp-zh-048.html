**Item #:** SCP-ZH-048

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** All information related to SCP-ZH-048 should be wiped out on any maps and geographical websites. The streets, commercial sites and households surrounding the object have been purchased a Foundation front company to prevent intrusion by citizens.

As SCP-ZH-048-A has never left SCP-ZH-048, the subject has not been detained, instead being monitored by security cameras placed in and around SCP-ZH-048. If any suspicious entities show up around SCP-ZH-048 and/or SCP-ZH-048-A behaves abnormally, an on-site director should be notified and standard response protocols activated.

The whereabouts of SCP-ZH-048-B and/or other potential anomalous entities are currently under investigation. In the event that an emergence of such entities is reported, Foundation assets are to be deployed to determine the claim&#39;s credibility, and to contain said anomalous entities.

**Description:** SCP-ZH-048 is a franchise store of the beverage shop //&#34;Tea &amp; Magic Hands&#34;//[[footnote]]Translator Note: 茶之魔手. An in-real-life beverage shop franchise mainly running in southern Taiwan.[[/footnote]], located in ███████████. The interior decoration, equipment and facilities of the item show no difference from its non-anomalous counterpart.

Whenever a customer approaches SCP-ZH-048&#39;s order counter, an SCP-ZH-048-A entity will come to contact with them. SCP-ZH-048-A usually presents as a young humanoid entity in its twenties wearing uniforms adorned with the logo of //&#34;Tea &amp; Magic Hands&#34;//. SCP-ZH-048-A will then provide the following menu and ask which product the customer wants to order.

After an order is submitted, SCP-ZH-048-A will start to produce the requested item with in-store assets. It is observed that all SCP-ZH-048-A&#39;s selection of ingredients[[footnote]]Since containment was established, all edible ingredients used by the establishment have been provided by Foundation. It has been observed that changing the items&#39; ingredients does not modify their anomalous effects.[[/footnote]] and drink-making process is seemingly identical to its non-anomalous counterpart. SCP-ZH-048-A will then return to the counter, providing the requested drink and asking for payment. Drinking these &#34;potions&#34; will affect human subjects in a variety of ways, see the following tests for details:

[[collapsible show=&#34;▶ Show Records of Experiments&#34; hide=&#34;▼ Hide&#34;]]
All research personnel should follow the Laboratory Rules.
The following experiments aim to observe and record all effects created by SCP-ZH-048&#39;s merchandise on human physiology, along with the confounding influence from different variations.
Previous experiments on zoological subjects has guaranteed the personal safety of human subjects.

&gt; **Object:** Potion of Health Restoration
&gt; **Appearance:** Scarlet liquid with a soft glow
&gt; **Procedure:** Comparing the results of different drink volumes, different additives, differing sweetness levels, and different ice levels after being given to different subjects.
&gt; **Result:** The flavor was described as similar to black tea[[footnote]]Translator&#39;s Note: &#34;black tea&#34; is called &#34;red tea&#34; in Mandarin, due to its hue.[[/footnote]]. Subjects who consumed the potion exhibited different extents of self-regeneration; damaged cells were able to rebuild themselves at a rate that was noticeable to the naked eye. The rate of tissue regeneration was proportional to the drink&#39;s sweetness level; the choice of volume, additives, or ice level showed no significant impact.
&gt; ----
&gt; **Object:** Potion of Mana Restoration
&gt; **Appearance:** Sapphire liquid with a soft glow
&gt; **Procedure:** Comparing the results of different drink volumes, different additives, differing sweetness levels, and different ice levels after being given to different subjects.
&gt; **Result:** The flavor was described as identical to light-roasted oolong[[footnote]]Translator&#39;s  Note: this kind of tea is named &#34;青茶&#34; in Mandarin, meaning &#34;cyan tea&#34;.[[/footnote]]. Those who drank the potion have been observed to emit more EVE[[footnote]]Elan-Vital Energy, the fundamental power which drives thaumaturgy.[[/footnote]] than standard emission rates. The rate of EVE emission was proportional to the drink&#39;s sweetness level; the choice of volume, additives, or ice level showed no significant impact.
&gt; ----
&gt; **Object:** Potion of Divine Blessing
&gt; **Appearance:** Emerald green liquid with a soft glow
&gt; **Procedure:** Comparing the results of different drink volumes, different additives, differing sweetness levels, and different ice levels after being given to different subjects.
&gt; **Result:** The flavor was described as identical to green tea. Those who drank the potion have been partially relieved or fully healed from all diseases (if any) they previously suffered from. The intensity of recovery was proportional to the drink&#39;s sweetness level; the choice of volume, additives, or ice level showed no significant impact.
&gt; ----
&gt; **Object:** Potion of Full Restoration
&gt; **Appearance:** Violet liquid with a soft glow
&gt; **Procedure:** Comparing the results of different drink volumes, different additives, differing sweetness levels, and different ice levels after being given to different subjects.
&gt; **Result:** The flavor was described as identical to Oolong tea. Subjects who drank this potion instantly healed from any and all injuries or maladies they had prior to experimentation; this effect also applied to those who were fatally wounded or had incurable diseases. Furthermore, all subjects were detected to emit large amount of EVE, with some of them even having the potential for low level thaumaturgy or minor ontokinesis. These subjects have been designated as SCP-ZH-███ for further study. All variations in this series of experiments showed no impact on the potency of the potion.
&gt; ----
&gt; **Object:** Arcanum of Resurrection
&gt; **Appearance:** Golden liquid with soft glow
&gt; **Procedure:** Comparing the results of different drink volumes, different additives, differing sweetness levels, and different ice levels after being given to different subjects.
&gt; **Result:** The flavor was described as identical to milk tea. Consuming the potion showed no noticeable effects on subjects. [DATA EXPUNGED] the subjects or [INSUFFICIENT CLEARANCE] did not produce the expected results. Adjusting sweetness level, ice levels, or choices of additives led to the same result.

**Addendum:** Interview Log

[[collapsible show=&#34;▶ Interview with SCP-ZH-048-A&#34; hide=&#34;▼ Hide&#34;]]
&gt; **Prologue:** The first interview with SCP-ZH-048-A after containment procedure was established. Agent ████ Chien approached SCP-ZH-048&#39;s counter, attempting to interact with an SCP-ZH-048-A entity.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Start of Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt ████ Chien:** Hello.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ZH-048-A:** Hi! What would you like today?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt ████ Chien:** (showing falsified credentials) I&#39;d like to ask you a few questions in the name of the government, if you&#39;d have the time.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ZH-048-A:** (awkwardly smiles) Questions...? Well, you can find our customer service hotline on our website, so I&#39;m not sure I...
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt ████ Chien:** It&#39;s specifically about this franchise location. Mainly because the drinks you serve are... different than the other stores. Is this some kind of unique commercial strategy? Some marketing trick to catch people&#39;s eyes?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ZH-048-A:** I don&#39;t get what you mean. We&#39;ve all gone through standard company training, so our products shouldn&#39;t be all too different than what you&#39;re used to.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt ████ Chien:** (takes out a standard //Tea &amp; Magic Hands// menu) Do you notice the difference between this menu and that of your store?
&gt; 
&gt; (Video records show that the contents of menu are instantly transformed into menu of SCP-ZH-048 on the brink of SCP-ZH-048-A&#39;s hand touching Agent Chien&#39;s menu.)
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ZH-048-A:** Frankly, I don&#39;t.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt ████ Chien:** I see.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ZH-048-A:** Do you have any more questions? Would you like to try something?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt ████ Chien:** Just one more question. It&#39;s about your Arcanum of Resurrection. Its effect seems not to match its title.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ZH-048-A:** Did you use the Arcanum for someone who died in a battle with The Flavorless King or his minions?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt ████ Chien:** I didn&#39;t... No... Wait, what?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ZH-048-A:** The Flavorless King? It&#39;s taught in most middle schools, right? The &#34;Prophecy of The Hero and The Flavorless King&#34;?  The Flavorless King, leading his Four Heavenly Monarchs - The Sweetless, The Savoriless, The Bitterless, and The Sourless - to invade this land, taking away all flavors of magic, merely to fulfill his own ambition of conquering the whole world. Only the legendary Hero and his companions will be able to stop them? You know of that too, don&#39;t you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agt ████ Chien:** ...I&#39;m sorry, exactly what kind of folklore are you talking about?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ZH-048-A:** Are you sure you&#39;re from the government? Is this some kind of prank or what?
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End of Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Postscript:** The interview was halted due to arising SCP-ZH-048-A&#39;s suspicion. This interview suggests that SCP-ZH-048 may have come from an alternative reality parallel to, yet not entire dissimilar with, our universe. The &#34;Flavorless King&#34; could be a hostile entity in the aforementioned world. Investigation into the alternative reality has been launched, aiming to prevent potential risk and incursion from relevant extra-dimensional forces.

**Addendum:** Video Records

[[collapsible show=&#34;▶ Video Records: 2021/05/19&#34; hide=&#34;▼ Hide&#34;]]

&gt; **Prologue:** The following record was extracted from the security camera set in SCP-ZH-048. An unknown figure (designated as SCP-ZH-048-B) passed through the monitoring personnel, entered SCP-ZH-048, and left the location after purchase. On-watch personnel reported no signs of intrusion during the event.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Start of Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ZH-048-A:** Hi! What would you like... Ah, if it isn&#39;t Mr. Hero? What a long time since your last visit! How have you been?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ZH-048-B：** (giving out a bitter smile) Forget it. The last battle was devastating. Never underestimate them.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ZH-048-A:** Ooh... Does that mean... you lost the fight?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ZH-048-B:** (shook his head) We made all efforts to defeat the Sweetless Monarch, but it was a Pyrrhic victory. I even broke the Hero&#39;s Sword. (paused) And... Lady Sage... She...
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ZH-048-A:** Lady Sage... Is she alright...?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ZH-048-B:** ...She swallowed massive pints of potions just to protect us, but the sugar rush caused her plenty of health problems. She&#39;s been admitted to the hospital yesterday.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ZH-048-A:** ...I see. But that&#39;s inevitable, right? After all, magic is sealed in sugar...
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ZH-048-B:** Anyway, I came here not just to buy some potions, but also to bid you farewell. The Sage fell. The Sword is broken, too. I must travel abroad, seeking ways to repair The Sword.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ZH-048-A:** You- You&#39;re leaving?! Then who will come to protect us from the Flavorless King&#39;s invasion?!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ZH-048-B:**  ...I... I&#39;m really, really sorry. I will return as soon as I can. Please hang in there for a bit...
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ZH-048-A:** ...Hey, no need to apologize. You&#39;ve done plenty for us, Hero. Today&#39;s tab is on me, my treat.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ZH-048-B:** ...Thank you. I&#39;m sorry about everything...
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End of Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Postscript:** According to the video records, SCP-ZH-048-A and SCP-ZH-048-B seem to be mutually acquainted and befriended. However, all questions regarding SCP-ZH-048-B were dismissed by SCP-ZH-048-A, stating he was &#34;not allowed to provide any client&#39;s personal information&#34;. Investigation regarding SCP-ZH-048-B and/or other potential anomalous figures are still ongoing.
