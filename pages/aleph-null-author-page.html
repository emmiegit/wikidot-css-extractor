Ah, the main show. It makes sense that you would come here first, considering it&#39;s the first tab.


[[[SCP-3369|SCP-3369 The Living Joke]]] co-authored with [[*user Jim North]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Commentary&#34; hide=&#34;- Hide&#34;]]
Ah, the infamous first SCP. A lucky few make it on their first try. I, unfortunately, had to go through multiple deletions to get this to stick. Luckily, my guardian angel, the aforementioned Jim, swooped down from the heavens to save my sorry ass. I wonder what he&#39;s up to? Oh, an 001 proposal... huh. Good for him!

The foundation&#39;s &#34;Cold Not Cruel&#34; mindset was always an important aspect to the organization to me when I first joined. Recently though, the interpretations I see are either not cold enough, or outright evil, which is fair, but maybe I&#39;m just misremembering how it was back then. This was an attempt to capture that type of foundation.

[[tab Tales]]
Want to check out some of my prose? Good thing I labeled this tab &#34;Tales.&#34;

My first tale was for the Original Character Tournament featuring SCP-3369, SCP-3416, and SCP-3947. I&#39;m really hoping for another OCT, but considering how the first one turned out, there probably won&#39;t be another. I&#39;ll keep hoping though.

I&#39;m not gonna be coy with this one, it fucking sucks. I made so many wrong turns with this I ended up driving off a cliff face. Why&#39;s it still up? Because maybe one day I&#39;ll rewrite it, and give a concept like this the execution it deserves. There&#39;s a pretty good reason I barely used any established concepts after this, it&#39;s because I didn&#39;t feel like I deserved to play with other people&#39;s toys. I think if I tackled this nowadays it would be better but I gotta wrap up what I&#39;m doing with my toys first.

The idea of the first D-Class was on my mind a lot when I was writing this up. I like how it turned out, it think of it as my first genuinely good article.

I think up until this article, I hadn&#39;t been that good at character-driven stories, which sucked for me because those are my favorite type of story. I&#39;m really pleased with how this one came out, and can&#39;t wait to explore Terry some more.[[/collapsible]]

Admittedly, this one&#39;s a bit shallow, but I still think it came out well. I work in the fast food industry right now and this was me venting some frustrations.[[/collapsible]]

[[tab GoI Formats]]
Expect this one to remain vacant.

[[tab Other]]
This tab will be used to express some of my thoughts down the road. unfortunately I have no thoughts at this moment.
