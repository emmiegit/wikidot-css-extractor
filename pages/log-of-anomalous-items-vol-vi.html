&gt;  **Foreword:** The SCP Foundation has discovered a substantial number of items which are simply too useless to merit further attention. This document lists those items which have prompted some curiosity. It may be used as a resource should knowledge of these items become useful or necessary in the future.

This ceramic breadbox contains a plastic breadbox of equal size within itself. This pattern seemingly continues infinitely.
**Date of Recovery:** 8/28/23
**Location of Recovery:** Residence outside of Kangar, Malaysia
**Current Status:** Contained in Site-351.
//Notes: Testing of this item has been halted in part due to the emergence of breadboxes made of harmful materials (AO-1255-319 was composed of Lead, AO-1255-320 was composed of Technetium-99m), and upon the subsequent realization that it is not possible to place a breadbox back inside of another breadbox of equal size.//

**Item Description:** A custom-built revolver matching no known model of firearm. It is engraved with ornate patterns along the barrel depicting numerous figures kneeling as if in prayer. The object of their worship is not depicted. Any shot fired from the weapon is guaranteed to hit its target, so long as an attempt is made to aim towards it, and the injuries inflicted upon any living target struck are invariably fatal. Firing it instantly kills the wielder. Anyone who touches the object becomes immediately aware of its anomalous properties.

Most noticeably, several instances of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2009 SCP-2009-01][[footnote]] Humans whose appearances and personalities have been altered by the fungal disease known as SCP-2009, all of whom answer to &#34;Thomas Hoang&#34;.

**Current Status:** Contained in anomalous articles storage, Site-28.

**Item Description:** Instructions for a thaumaturgic ritual allowing a user to &#34;fully stabilize an object&#34;. Decryption of glyphs implies that any object affected by this ritual will be &#34;locked&#34; into its current static position in the universe and will become totally unaffected by outside forces. However, successful application will invariably cause the object to fly off into the distance at great speed from the viewer’s perspective due to the Earth’s rotation and movement through space. Instructions are written in blue ink on a previously crumpled piece of copy paper.

**Item Description:** An unmarked white detonator stick with a bright red button made of plastic. The button remains spring-loaded up via an unknown mechanism; upon disassembly, the internals of the hollow stick are empty, and opening it immediately stops the button from being usable. Viewers including those seeing it remotely through cameras, and those who are within 12 meters of the button experience a compulsion to press it, yet are unable to bring themselves to do so at the final stages of preparing to press it. Those in the 12 meter area will feel distress upon the button being pressed. Pressing the button has been revealed to do nothing, although it makes such a satisfying click in the recording...

Recovery is considered a Moderate priority.

**Item Description:** One adult female //Raphus cucullatus//[[footnote]] Dodo [[/footnote]] moving at approximately 1/1,000,000,000th speed. A significant amount of scratches exist across its feathers, though due to the fleeting nature of the respective causes, no actual damage has occurred to or been noticed by AO-1279.

Pigments contained within these tiles continuously shift hue and shade to create the impression that all humans in the image are moving in various ways, such as kneeling, bowing, wailing, running, or hiding. Notably, a large group of these humans in white or black robes move so as to anachronistically recreate the //Bad Apple!!// (1998) music video in its entirety.
