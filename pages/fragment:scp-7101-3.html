**Incident Report: 7/002--01/01/2026:**
------
An increase in discoveries of hostile anomalous entities, hazardous objects, and phenomena was noted throughout the year 2025, more than were found in 2024 by around 12%. Additionally, the total estimated cost of containment for new contained anomalies increased by around 7%, resulting in several necessary budget cuts and cost-saving measures being taken, including the closing of certain low-importance sites, less funding being put into [[[SCP-6200|experimental scientific fields]]], and additional privileges and responsibilities being placed upon the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/decom-dept-hub Decommissioning Department] to account for this increase.

**Incident Report: 7/003--28/09/2029:**
------
At around 09:12 (AEST) PM, the monitoring system attached to O5-06 showed their heart rate drop to 0, fatal. It was later found that they had suffered cardiac arrest while playing with their infant child in a clandestine safehouse. Attempts to resuscitate them failed, as the on-site defibrillators were damaged sometime prior, awaiting replacements.

**Incident Report: 7/004--09/03/2032:**
------
At around 16:28 PM, Site-19 was raided by a force of several hundred operatives from GoI-006 (&#34;Chaos Insurgency&#34;). Despite great efforts led by on-site task forces and security personnel, the site was lost to the group, and a majority of contained anomalies were either stolen or destroyed. The site was then closed after retrieving all possible personnel or items, which were then dispensed among other sites.

Post recovery, 4 members of the group were found to be within the facility. They were interrogated, revealing that a secret agent within the group was stationed in a separate facility, and found a copy of an uncensored Site-19 dossier after bumping into a Site-director. Both dropped their documents, and the dossier was unintentionally switched in the ensuing confusion.

**Discovery:**
------
SCP-7000 was discovered after a notable incremental rise in incidents from 2022 - 2032 occurring due to random chance led the Foundation to begin making more intensive observations of subjects and places wherein such incidents took place.

During these investigations, Director Roufhous[[footnote]]Director Pendant Roufhous, 7000 Project Lead[[/footnote]] noticed a repeating factor in personnel observing Areas of Interest, that is the mention of &#34;Luck&#34;, and summing up such incidents to, particularly negative instances of &#34;Luck&#34;.

After witnessing 8 instances of investigative personnel referencing this, Director Roufhous found a correlation between those affected and their Cognitive Resistance Value (CRV) being lower than ~6. After contacting Director Natasha Stepanov of the Department of Cognitohazards, the cognitohazards were found to be localized to exact areas affected by SCP-7000. Additionally, subjects possessing a lower CRV than ~2.9 were found to rarely reference a personification of SCP-7000, those being &#34;Lady Luck&#34;, &#34;RNGesus&#34;, &#34;Ms. Fortune&#34;, and more notably, &#34;Fortuna&#34;[[footnote]]The Roman deity of luck and fortune.[[/footnote]], in these areas.

This reference to Fortuna led Director Roufhous to contact Director Kaleb Tennanbaum[[footnote]]Department of Applied Theology Head, previously Head of Tactical Theology pre-Crusade Campaign (2032)[[/footnote]], which caused alarm in the department of a second resurgence event[[footnote]] The Crusade Campaign, 2027 - 2032, a period in which deific entities and icons from various cultural mythologies manifested, requiring incredible joint-efforts from the Foundation and the GOC to conceal, contain, and neutralize such entities.[[/footnote]], which was only heightened after the usage of an ABSRDeI[[footnote]] Adair-Baley Sub-Reality Deific-entity Identifier, a notably crude construct used to confirm the deific status and origin of input entities and phenomenon.[[/footnote]] returned indefinite results.

SCP-7000 was later differentiated from Fortuna in 2035, when no tangible source for SCP-7000&#39;s effect was found, which differed from Fortuna&#39;s physical body acting as a point of origin for its anomalous phenomenon.

All data on SCP-7000 was then compiled in 2036, and procedures were then devised and put into place in the same year.
