**Item #:** SCP-3315

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3315 should be kept inside a copper-shielded thermal insulation locker and stored within the Site-76 Low-Risk Inanimate Objects Warehouses when not in use. All personnel interested in research with the object must first obtain approval from project head prior to experimentation. Additionally, personnel requests for testing purposes require administrative approval and several rounds of D-Class screening prior to admission.  

All testing is to be recorded and observed from within Site-76&#39;s experimentation chambers. This chamber should be retrofitted with a Faraday mesh and shielded with TO-3 thermal resistance pods that must be inspected daily by members of research staff.

**Description:** SCP-3315 is the designation for a 25 cm black aluminum ice pick with &#34;p e r s e v e r a n c e&#34;[[footnote]]It is to note that the white spacing between letters is intentional. [[/footnote]] engraved onto its handle. The object itself is comprised of non-anomalous material, with a handle composed of carbon fiber-reinforced thermoplastic and an aluminum carabiner ring on the blunt end. 

SCP-3315 is abnormally cold, registering in at ~193 K (approximately -79.4° C), requiring use of protective equipment when handling. The carabiner ring features a single handwritten note, laminated and attached via plastic zip-tie. Attempts to remove or otherwise alter the components or state of SCP-3315 have failed. 

The note reads as follows:

O wanderer, struck forth on heaven&#39;s eye

What mysteries of yonder frozen ridges hide?

Steal your fate with the pick on high

When you climb to reach perseverance&#39;s side
[[/div]]

When an individual grasps SCP-3315 and lifts it from a surface, they will disappear from all visual and global positioning systems. The subject will then be instananeously translocated to an alternate locality defined as SCP-3315-1. During this period, audio broadcasting reception can still be detected with decent clarity within two kilometers of the point from which SCP-3315 had vanished. 

Once the subject appears within SCP-3315-1, they will be unrecoverable until they expire, whereupon they reemerge alive and unscathed within SCP-3315&#39;s original location. During the event, subjects are unable to die of hunger, thirst, or asphyxiation, despite reports of having experienced symptoms of such things. All other forms of termination work without issue. In  addition, subjects are unable to lose SCP-3315, intentionally or otherwise. 
 
SCP-3315-1 is a single mountain range of unknown size, subject to a dense fog that obscures the surrounding area. Topographical expeditions of this locale have yielded inconclusive data, suggesting that SCP-3315-1 is not located on Earth and is randomly or procedurally generated with each instance of its manifestation. However, certain items and features reappear within different manifestations of SCP-3315-1. Research into how SCP-3315 constructs its reality is still under analysis.

**Addendum-3315-A:** Discovery and Recovery Log

SCP-3315 was brought to Foundation attention on 05/11/2002 after the hospitalization of trailer park supervisor Francis ████████, who had claimed to have suffered several &#34;hallucinogenic episodes&#34; in which he had found himself with lost time and in an unknown location. ████████ states that he had been cleaning out the unit of a tenant who was presumed dead in a housefire three days prior, when he was transported to SCP-3315-1, perishing rapidly due to hypothermia. After reappearing, he had attempted to return to work several times before admitting himself to a nearby hospital. A Foundation agent stationed as a nurse reported the claims and an official investigation was deployed.

████████&#39;s tenant records were seized and it was determined that the lot in question had belonged to a █████ ██████. It is unknown if this is a real name or not, as no other records of such individual were registered within █████████████ County nor any of the surrounding counties. ████████ was unable to provide any further details about the individual, stating that the tenant was invalid and that he had rarely interacted with the person in question. It should be noted that no remains were discovered among the wreckage of the trailer.

Foundation efforts to properly identify SCP-3315 took place over the next day, during which its anomalous properties came to light. Anomalous Items Recovery Unit 33B (&#34;Scavengers&#34;) was assigned to the location. Records of their debriefing can be found below.

&gt; 
&gt; //Note: Following is a transcript of AIRU-33B member Agent Mackenzie Driscoll&#39;s debrief post-recovery of SCP-3315 to Site-76 Director Mahmoodah Agarwal.//

&gt; -----
&gt; 
&gt; = {{&lt;BEGIN TRANSCRIPT&gt;}}
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Agarwal:** Alright, Agent Driscoll, if you would.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Driscoll:** Okay—[clears throat]—Agent Mackenzie Driscoll, Anomalous Items Recovery Division, unit thirty-three-bee, May fifteenth, two-thousand and-
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Agarwal:** Just—please describe your experience when you were recovering the object. For the record.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Driscoll:** Ah, sorry. We don&#39;t really get anything this interesting, usually. Anyway, we were deployed to [REDACTED], some trailer park out there in the pine barrens, and Jacobs—Agent Jacobs—was on the job with me at the time. So, we drove out there and started poking around the burned-up unit. Jacobs was the first to notice something off about the place, I mean it was cold. Like, we stepped into what was left of the trailer and it just felt wrong. Not in a bad way, mind you, but it was weird.
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Agarwal:** Care to go into more detail?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Driscoll:** Well, I quickly noticed the smell. It was frigid in there, and it smelled like we were outside. Like, I could taste the snow and the mountains instead of smoke and burned plastic. It was refreshing, but we were not dressed for the cold, and everything in the trailer was damp and covered in soot. Jacobs saw the pick after a minute or so, in perfect condition, and he reached for it, barely picked the thing up off the ground before he just up and vanished. The next thirty minutes were a blur. I radioed in that Jacobs had gone missing and I remember that Site Command was in a bit of an argument about whether or not to dispatch a more, uh, trained group before I heard Jacobs yelling from inside the trailer.
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Agarwal:** And what did you do then?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Driscoll:** I went back inside, of course. Jacobs was young. Not his first roundup, mind you, but this was something different. He was shivering and sobbing, and I just held him until the rest of &#39;em showed up. He was going on about the cold and the endless snow, babbling like a baby but otherwise unharmed. I&#39;m just glad he was wearing his gloves, because he probably would have lost a few fingers if he wasn&#39;t. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Agarwal:** Alright. What about the pick?
&gt;  
&gt; **Agent Driscoll:** It was just lying there next to him, inanimate. I knew not to touch the damned thing. A little while later more recovery agents showed up, Abernathy and Pierce, and I warned them not to touch it either. They got some tongs and put the pick in a plastic bag, then we brought it onsite.
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Agarwal:** Thank you, Agent Driscoll. That about covers it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Driscoll:** No problem, ma&#39;am.

&gt; **D-85748:** Yeah. Loud and clear.
&gt;

&gt; **D-85748:** I-I don&#39;t like this, I&#39;m //not// a fan of heights.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Langstaff:** Please try and be more descriptive of your surroundings.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** Okay, well, I&#39;m on a mountain in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, there&#39;s snow and ice and it is windy as—agh—//Jesus take the wheel.// [loud rustling] Alright. Sorry about that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Langstaff:** Are you okay?
&gt;  
&gt; **D-85748:** Yeah-Yeah, I nearly ate it right there, but I&#39;m good—[cough]—It really is something beautiful out here, even if I&#39;m absolutely terrified. Whew. Its gotta be well under freezing. This suit is a wonder, alright. [muffled noises] Okay, which way should I go?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Langstaff:** Please check your attached compass.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** [shuffling] uh, no good. The pin is spinning constantly around. Any ideas?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Langstaff:** Do you see any identifying landmarks?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** Nothing—or, I think I see some higher peaks peeking through the clouds, maybe I should just follow them then? Have a good look around?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Langstaff:** Good idea, please proceed.
&gt; 
&gt; //Sounds of wind and shuffling can be picked up for several minutes.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** Alright, I think I see some trees in the distance. Nothing much else. Lots of fog. 
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject proceeds in this manner for some time, until 14:40, where loud sounds of scraping and movement can be heard.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** Wha—Oh fuck—[muffled] Ah, ah—I can&#39;t—[sounds of struggle and a sharp whine in the microphone can be heard]—Ow. [groans] Okay. Okay.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Langstaff:** D-85748, are you alright?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** Yeah, but I&#39;m stuck. Some snow moved and I-I&#39;m caught underneath. Oh god, you have to do something. [panicked] You have to send someone to help me!
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Langstaff:** I&#39;m sorry, but that is not possible at this time. Can you dig yourself out?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** [breathing heavily] O-Okay, let me try again. [strains]
&gt; 
&gt; //More movement and struggling.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** Shit! No, I can&#39;t get out, and I think I&#39;m stuck for serious.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Langstaff:** Okay, remain calm. We are going to talk you through this.
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Langstaff remains in contact with D-85748 for the remainder of his shift, instructing him on how to conserve his body heat and remaining oxygen while aiding him in melting snow for drinking. Soon after, Agent Wyatt takes over.//
&gt; 
&gt;  **Agent Wyatt:** Hey, D-85748. This is Agent Wyatt. So, I don&#39;t know if this is good news for you, but you aren&#39;t going to die like this, especially not by thirst.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** [exhales slowly] Well that isn&#39;t helping me right now. I still feel the pain, I&#39;m so //goddamn// hungry. Everything is so cold, I can barely move my toes anymore.
&gt; 
&gt;  **Agent Wyatt:** Don&#39;t worry, we will get through this.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** [chuckles] Yeah, //we//. Sure.
&gt; 
&gt;  **Agent Wyatt:** Poor choice of words. Sorry.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** It—[cough]—It&#39;s fine. I will persevere.
&gt; 
&gt;  **Agent Wyatt:** Hey—yeah, that&#39;s it. Have you still got your pick?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** Huh? Oh? Oh, yeah. Could&#39;ve sworn I lost it a ways back but it&#39;s half-buried next to me.
&gt; 
&gt;  **Agent Wyatt:**  See if you can get yourself out, okay?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** Urgh, let me try.
&gt; 
&gt; //Sounds of movement are heard, followed by a large groaning sound, likely more snow displacing.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** Oh, crap-

&gt; **Notes:** Subject equipped with two-way earpiece, climbing gear, similar Osprey-52 variant extreme environment multi-day supply pack, and one hiking pole.
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; = {{&lt;Begin Log&gt;}}
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject once again starts at Site-76, experimentation hangar.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Wyatt:** Alright. Can you hear me?
&gt; 
&gt;  **D-85748:** I-I can. Let&#39;s just get this over with.
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject obtains SCP-3315 and the test proceeds as prior. Subject continues on for an hour.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** I can see some footprints here. This path is a bit less treacherous than last. I wish I had seen this before.
&gt; 
&gt; //D-85748 proceeds unhindered for the next twelve hours.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** There&#39;s something at the top of this peak. It looks like—shit. It looks like a cabin.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Langstaff:** Please continue and report anything unusual.
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject does not respond and climbs for another three hours.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** Okay, I&#39;ve made it. Finally. Fuck you, mountains.
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject is heard breathing deeply.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** There&#39;s a house up here. It looks—well, it&#39;s rustic, but it will do. No light on inside. 
&gt; 
&gt; //D-85748&#39;s footsteps are heard to change from snow to something hard.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** This place is well made. Door&#39;s unlocked—hello?
&gt; 
&gt; //Microphone picks up silence and background noises for several seconds.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** No one is home. It looks lived in, though. Some candles here, let me light them up.
&gt; 
&gt; //Silence for fifteen seconds. Subject is heard sighing.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** //And I said, let there be light.// [chuckles]
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject is heard moving, the sounds of wind can be heard blowing outside.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** Would you look at this—potatoes, canned goods, even some booze. Someone really wanted to make themselves at home here. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** This place is actually quite nice. One small prize, but a prize nonetheless. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Langstaff:** Don&#39;t get too comfortable. Investigate the rest of the house, D-85748.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** Don&#39;t you think I deserve some rest? [sighs] Fine.
&gt; 
&gt; //More sounds of movement can be heard. The cabin creaks under pressure from strong winds.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** There&#39;s a bedroom here. Small bed, probably made for one or two. Little nightstand too, let me check the drawer—oh.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Langstaff:** What is it?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** There&#39;s a note. And-And a gun.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Langstaff:** A gun? What does the note say?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** A revolver. It looks old. It&#39;s loaded. The note reads—&#39;O wanderer, found atop these icy peaks, climb the bodies broken over perseverance&#39;s knee. May your stay be as well and rested as you so choose to be, for you and only you now are the one who sets you free.&#39;
&gt; 
&gt; //Silence for five seconds.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Langstaff:** D-85748, please exit the house.
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject does not respond.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Langstaff:** D-85748, follow the command or you will face repercussions upon your return.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** You know what? No. Screw you. Screw you and screw your whole Foundation. I-I climbed this mountain, the whole range—I conquered it! I fucking broke bones to get to the top of this place. You-you wouldn&#39;t even let me keep a photograph. Now that I&#39;m up here, I understand. The ridges weren&#39;t meant for you. They&#39;re meant for me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Langstaff:** I&#39;m sorry, but what do you mean by that?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-85748:** What I mean is that //you can go fuck yourselves//, I&#39;m staying here.
&gt; 
&gt; //At this point, subject removes earpiece and ceases contact with Agent Langstaff. SCP-3315 is reported missing and D-85748 is considered MIA.//

Following Exploration Log 3315-1-C, SCP-3315 does not reappear in Site-76 for three years, six months and fifteen days. Radio contact with D-85748 was attempted daily, however, the subject remained uncooperative, leaving his earpiece disabled for most of the time, occasionally activating the headset to goad personnel and reiterate his &#34;victory&#34;. D-85748 and SCP-3315 are both recovered without hassle. D-85748 was then terminated, following his arrival and subsequent interrogation.[[/collapsible]]
