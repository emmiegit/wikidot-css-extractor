[[[In Response To Nuclear Warheads]]] - This is the first article I published and it survived on the second attempt. As it is with a lot of first articles this desperately needs a rewrite. The idea was to give a compelling argument both for and against using on-site warheads (excluding nuclear warheads in particular, which is a dumb idea) and let the reader decide which side of the argument they fall on. Also includes some worldbuilding for a Foundation-Site that suffered the consequences of nuclear fallout (which I should revisit eventually) and a first look at ExaRD and Director Thomas Weld

[[[Nobody there, but the thing-in-itself ]]] - My other thing from jamcon2020 that survived (My Explained SCP about Object Class-tasting Synesthesia didn&#39;t make it). What I was trying to do here makes more sense if you read the [[[Nobody Hub]]] beforehand. That is, using the anomalous object as a sort of reflection of the character. In this case, it&#39;s more about how even this imperceptible thing can interact more with the world than Nobody. And I wanted to have a bit of fun with this philosophical concept. I&#39;m very happy with how this one turned out.

[[[SC-48/404-97/786]]] - I love the Chaos Insurgency GOI format and I&#39;m really happy it&#39;s slowly starting to see some use again. This was my first attempt at it and also my first non-contest article. And it involves time travel which is not a good idea to use for one of your first articles. The main problem is making it both interesting and explainable to the reader. I hope it&#39;s clear enough here but there are a few things left here that could use a bit more explanation as I originally intended this to be followed by an SCP file about roughly the same incidents, which also dives a bit more into Sir Kneverbeen and the Family. Still, it&#39;s a fun format.

[[[SCP-2023-EX]]] - This was my article for the [[[Exquisite Corpse Contest]]], in which I submitted Explained for the first phase, and got something Explained for the second and third. With that, this article marks the second in which I introduce the Explanation and Research Department before actually writing its introduction. Writing this article was a bit of a problem as it needed to be something Explained that still required an anti-Kinetohazard task force. And I really wanted to write a kinetohazard fight scene. I settled for an ultimately unnecessary long fight scene, that&#39;s not really needed and a legal disaster to explain how it got the Explained designation. It&#39;s also set in Broken Masquerade, which is nice.

[[[Writing History]]] - Another Contest entry. This time for the [[[Canon Renaissance Contest]]] with my team Well Versed for Bellerverse (the story is still being worked on in case anyone wants to know). It took a bit before I found the right voice for this one, but I had fun writing it after I did. Reimagining how things worked out after the world ended is a lot of fun. I&#39;m a bit bumped, that nobody tried to find out which SCPs are hidden in the tale, but I suppose the site doesn&#39;t do that anymore.

[[[A Working Theory]]] - This was a gift I made in the [[[art-exchange-hub | 2020 Art Exchange]]] for Connor MacWarren. I tried to structure this a bit like an episode of a SciFi TV show akin to Doctor Who and such. A lot of unresolved SciFi-mystery at the start with steadily rising tension, a hopefully understandable technobabble solution that resolves the mystery, and a cliffhanger for the next episode.

[[[SCP-5582]]] - Another Article for a contest (Do you see a pattern yet?), this time [[[Jam-Con 2021]]]. As is probably clear from the title this was a soft reimagining/satire of SCP-682, with the main difference being that the Foundation fails to fulfil its primary mission of containment here instead of trying to kill it. In my first draft of this almost every line or formatting was a direct or indirect jab at the SCP-682 article, but I got a bit away from that to better make room for the life-affirming message this article now (hopefully) conveys. The result is a bit messy and I want to rewrite this, but got a lot of crit that goes in different directions, so I&#39;m a bit unsure what to do with this for now.

EDIT: I got around to rewriting the end. It should still come through that 5582 is too old for anything, but still just has fun in mind. I&#39;m very happy with the new ending.

[[[Of Memes and Counterconcepts]]] - My second Jamcon 2021 entry. This is also the first step into my headcanon of how I imagine the bureaucracy surrounding the First Memetics Department lashes out. I tried to do something similar to A Working Theory regarding the TV show structure, but I think that worked out better for A Working Theory. I think it&#39;s okay, but it&#39;s definitely the weakest of my 2021 Jamcon entries. Having only a few hours for this didn&#39;t help.

[[[SC-02/000-22/000]]] - My third 2021 Jamcon article, that actually won and got featured![[size 80%]] In a category with only one other contestant.[[/size]] I only realized after the end that this jamcon didn&#39;t have any restrictions like &#34;1 SCP, 1 Tale, and 1 GOI-format&#34; like the last one, but I think I&#39;ll continue doing it that way for future jamcons because it&#39;s a fun restriction. I&#39;m actually a bit bumped that this one has no comments despite being featured and doing well (as of the time I&#39;m writing this). I think right now this is probably the article from me that is most likely to build upon by other authors, which is one of the main ideas here. That&#39;s why I tried to introduce multiple CI cell leaders (and with it different CI versions) to give the Insurgency a more cohesive feeling. I&#39;m especially happy with having a sort of pataphysics character (Linda Liesmith) that doesn&#39;t really take up much of the spotlight with pataphysics shenanigans. The other idea I had here was basically the Chaos Insurgency&#39;s answer to SCP-2000 (which the title number is a reference to): A dead man switch that unleashes dozens of methods to end the world simultaneously. It was also fun to look SCPs up the Insurgency could use to end the world efficiently. I think I did the format more justice than I did on my first try.

[[[SCP-5187]]] - This one was not posted for a contest! There are a few ideas that culminated into this article. Mainly the idea of an SCP file that shows the &#34;normal&#34; life of an SCP object from beginning to end, in this case, the end is being fully researched and then archived. And more introduction of the First Memetics Department that is adamant to adhere to the &#34;good old days&#34; of Foundation research and how they have standardized some horrible acts. The latter is probably a bit invisible as this is a thing the average SCP reader is oversaturated with. The article also includes a snippet of my genuine fear of being lost in the vastness of space. I also tried a bit of using &#34;word fields&#34; like how the researcher notes talk a lot about &#34;cleanly- and pureness&#34;. Includes also yet another reference to ExaRD before its actual introduction.

I like to think of this article as furniture. It&#39;s not really that interesting, but it is well built and that is how I want it to be.

[[[SCP-5226]]] - And now finally the introduction to the Explanation and Research Department. I originally wanted to introduce ExaRD in an Orientation, but that one had a lot of problems, so I introduced it here and later with a Site Dossier. It could still be a bit better, but I&#39;m happy with how this one turned out. The actual SCP is extremely simple and really just a metaphor (sort of) for the conflict between Roberts and Weld. I&#39;m also happy with the fact that both Characters have a somewhat understandable position and not only Weld how it was originally. The actual SCP object also serves as a nice compromise for their argument and how neither would have discovered the full truth if it wasn&#39;t for their discussion.

[[[SCP-6016]]] - And now my entry for [[[scp6000contesthub | 6kon]]]. If there is one thing that bothers me about this one a bit it&#39;s how unclear the GOC&#39;s intentions are, even though I intended it that way. That&#39;s because one of the ideas I wanted to present here is that the Foundation is a bit out of its depth and this is an anomaly that&#39;s really more suited for the GOC. Otherwise, I&#39;m very happy with the scope of this. I played a bit around with the format by having each sub anomaly with its own little Containment Procedures and such. There&#39;s also the idea here of how magical evolution (or nature) looks without human influence and how this changes after interactions with both the children of the night and later different human groups. A lot of things are only alluded to and I hope this evokes a bit of Series I feel (the good kind). Also go read the Wikipedia article about [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_cognition | Elephant cognition]]]. It&#39;s a good read (I know that&#39;s a weird thing to say about a Wikipedia article).

[[[SCP-6401]]] - This is the culmination of multiple ideas I had for a very long time. The first was a court that judges natural laws instead of human ones, and the idea that the taboo-Fae have seasonal Courts. An idea that is often seen with media surrounding Fae, that I felt was missing from the Wiki. I chose Autumn because that&#39;s my favourite season (birthday-related) and an often lesser focused one.  And in Autumn 2021 I felt I was experienced enough to do the idea justice. I wanted to expand a bit from other Fae-lore on the wiki, but it also takes inspiration from the IS and IS NOT stuff, which I made part of the judicial cycle system. I like the result and will likely post more cycle of seasons related stuff on other equinox or solstices.

I&#39;ve got the idea from a prompt from Placeholder McD of a civilian researcher employed at the Front finding out stuff. It ended up being an interview by a civilian instead. It sets up some things I&#39;d like to play with at a later point.

This one is a bit of a format screw because it&#39;s part of the first article after it got reclassified to Explained, with a focus on one human instance of the &#34;anomaly&#34;. If the first article focused more on the institutions themselves, this focused more on the effect this neglect has on the individual. There&#39;s also a bit about Containment Procedures being followed without reflection and information getting lost over time through this (the mistake becomes more apparent in later parts of the series). The reception of this wasn&#39;t that great, but I&#39;m very happy with it.

This was fun to &#34;write&#34; (by which I mean searching for the right thing to link to). There are a few crosslinks that don&#39;t fit that well with their text where the connection probably isn&#39;t that apparent to anyone who isn&#39;t me. However, this got translated a lot so I&#39;m not touching it again. I did try to find a good balance from anything from the site, so this links to an article from any serious, some tales and things that are both more and less popular. This also linked to an article with only +5 at one point, but I decided against linking that because I don&#39;t want this article to be the cause of something&#39;s deletion.

This time about the Spring Court or [[[taboo]]] from the GOC&#39;s point of view. This is also my first GOC format and it&#39;s also a bit of a format screw by being a Non-Threat (for political reasons, because the other party is watching over this document as well) and focusing on the Fae with a particular ruling schema for naming. The idea of every name needs to be in relation to //Her Lady// came from me simply wanting to do something different than the paraphrasing the Foundation does. But with paraphrasing really the only sensible thing to do I instead invented an Entity that enforced the way the GOC goes about this. This also brought the Arthurian Charter, the Erlking and some other small stuff into the [[[From 120&#39;s Archives Hub| From 120&#39;s Archives Canon]]]. For the Codeword: Nimue refers to //Her Lady// (hint hint), so Nimuedianetic refers to anything about //Her Lady&#39;s Subjects// as in the Fae, like Taboo. Karhu is just the designation for name-related hazards provided by Dr0Shadow and is a finish replacement word for bear, because the actual word is feared to summon one.

I intended to follow this one up with other articles set in the same time, which I never really did until much later. There is a severe lack of content for anything set before 1900 on the site. We know what precursor organizations were around, but what were they up to? How did their technology look like and what enemies did they face. This was basically an answer to that as well as my origin for memetics and the Central Memetics Department. I had to make some adjustments like renaming the First Memetics Department to the Central Memetics Department to fit the No Return canon.

The Court portion of this came about as the [[[Esterberg (City) — Wikipedia]]] page was just recently posted, which mentioned the &#34;Supreme Summer Court&#34; as operating within that. So I expanded the idea I already had, a Fae Court in the Internet, to include the esterbergian Court. The Supreme Summer Court did not end up enjoying its inclusion in the story. This is probably the article where I had to kill most of my &#34;darlings&#34;. The first version did mostly just state the mystery to solve for the reader as well as detailed descriptions of how the major websites looked like in this mystic cyberspace. It ended up not contributing to the article. Plus I added the investigation angle to make what happens clearer to the viewer. The two original ideas that this came out of was probably the idea of the fae using irc usernames as names and thinking about how the Foundation would contain internet anomalies that never seem to stop popping up. This is that containment method.

A joke you often hear in context of Tabletop Games where the dice might favour you today or not. This soon sprawled into the idea that history was quite literally up to luck ala controlled by the dice. I looked into a lot of history both on the site as in real life to look what events I could weave these dice presence into. Probably my favourite article by me as of writing. A friend of mine who I discussed this idea with early on is still angry I made the dice sapient instead of leaving that unclear.

One of the funniest (and most supported from what I read) theories about Halloween&#39;s origin is that it was a Christian festival from the start, but Christians accused Halloween of being pagan throughout history and therefore being against it. My other goal was to make a character that is by all intents and purposes a vampire but still feels like something that would come about the SCPverse. I&#39;m pretty happy with the result.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+Secure Facility Dossier: Site-118  &#34; hide=&#34;-Secure Facility Dossier: Site-118 &#34;]]

[[[Secure Facility Dossier Site-118|Secure Facility Dossier: Site-118  ]]] - Branching a bit out for the Cycle of Seasons series and made a site dossier for the second Autumn Article. The idea of this unified Site-118 came from a wrong entry in the [[[Facilities Complete List]]] that put a lot of Site-118 takes that had nothing to do with each other into one. This is mostly that site while taking some things from other ideas like weizhongs original Site that has [[[SCP-2006]]] and multiple Wings. The split in Wings ended up helping when I stumbled upon the problem of incorporating another Site-118 take: The Site has 24 floors and takes 2 years minimum to traverse from top to bottom. Now I could make it 3 much smaller sites instead. Another problem I stumbled upon while writing is that I can&#39;t really expect the reader to be aware of all these infohazards that have an influence on descriptions. So I ended up with General Containment Procedures for the Site at the top and colour-coding the infohazards. I had a lot of fun with the latter part which made the article descend more and more into chaos towards the end.

[[[KTE-5503-Bice-Copernicus]]] - There are very few articles about angels on the wiki. Most of the time when it comes to the divine, articles instead jump directly to gods instead of their underlings. This is the first part of a Five part &#34;Goi-Format&#34; series. Focusing on the GOC part the [[[goc-supplemental-threat-entities|Excerpts from PHYSICS Division Threat Entity Database]]] page had the entry &#34;Type White - Atypical Angel&#34; for a very long time and no one knew what that means. So I wondered why the GOC has an entry for specifically atypical angels. When I actually started writing this the type white entry was replaced with something else and [[*user Dr0Shadow]] came up with Bice (for the Beatrice character in Dante&#39;s work) as a codename instead. Other influences on designing what the Bice type actually meant was making sure the Gate Guardian would fit into it as well and having a threat entity that the GOC has to be more clever about to destroy.

[[tab Interesting Forum threads]]

A collection of Forum threads I find interesting:

* [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-13237221/on-containment | On Containment]]] - A shame this one isn&#39;t an article. If you don&#39;t know what to do with your Containment Procedures, this is for you.
* [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-1790933/what-are-your-unusual-headcanons | Unusual Headcanons]]] - A good dive if you need inspiration, but I would check with the author of the headcanon if they want to do something with it first.
* [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-5320007/the-gods-of-the-scp-universe | The Gods of the SCP Universe]]] - Probably not that interesting for you, but it was interesting for me
* [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-5085754/foundation-technology | Foundation technology]]] - A treasure trove of Foundation issued SciFi concepts
* [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-5174970/nothing-like-a-little-unnecessary-science-headcanon | Wormhole Classifications]]] - Classifications are fun

[[tab Testament]]

In case that I cease to be active on the wiki for more than one year, I give custody over my co-authored pieces to my co-authors, Christmas gifts to the ones they were for, group projects (like tale series or for contests) to the rest of the group and all other articles to the community as a whole to use as they see fit. More concretely I give anyone the ability  to make minor or major edits with prior Rewrite approval. I just ask that nothing from me be outright deleted as long as it&#39;s not rule-breaking or under -10. Thank you
