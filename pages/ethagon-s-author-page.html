In Chronological Order:

[[collapsible show=&#34;+In Response To Nuclear Warheads&#34; hide=&#34;-In Response To Nuclear Warheads&#34;]]

[[[In Response To Nuclear Warheads]]] - This is the first article I published and it survived on the second attempt. As it is with a lot of first articles this desperately needs a rewrite. The idea was to give a compelling argument both for and against using on-site warheads (excluding nuclear warheads in particular, which is a dumb idea) and let the reader decide which side of the argument they fall on. Also includes some worldbuilding for a Foundation-Site that suffered the consequences of nuclear fallout (which I should revisit eventually) and a first look at ExaRD and Director Thomas Weld

[[collapsible show=&#34;+Nobody there, but the thing-in-itself &#34; hide=&#34;-Nobody there, but the thing-in-itself &#34;]]

[[[Nobody there, but the thing-in-itself ]]] - My other thing from jamcon2020 that survived (My Explained SCP about Object Class-tasting Synesthesia didn&#39;t make it). What I was trying to do here makes more sense if you read the [[[Nobody Hub]]] beforehand. That is, using the anomalous object as a sort of reflection of the character. In this case, it&#39;s more about how even this imperceptible thing can interact more with the world than Nobody. And I wanted to have a bit of fun with this philosophical concept. I&#39;m very happy with how this one turned out.

[[[SC-48/404-97/786]]] - I love the Chaos Insurgency GOI format and I&#39;m really happy it&#39;s slowly starting to see some use again. This was my first attempt at it and also my first non-contest article. And it involves time travel which is not a good idea to use for one of your first articles. The main problem is making it both interesting and explainable to the reader. I hope it&#39;s clear enough here but there are a few things left here that could use a bit more explanation as I originally intended this to be followed by an SCP file about roughly the same incidents, which also dives a bit more into Sir Kneverbeen and the Family. Still, it&#39;s a fun format.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+SCP-2023-EX - Capable Athletes  &#34; hide=&#34;-SCP-2023-EX - Capable Athletes  &#34;]]

[[[SCP-2023-EX]]] - This was my article for the [[[Exquisite Corpse Contest]]], in which I submitted Explained for the first phase, and got something Explained for the second and third. With that, this article marks the second in which I introduce the Explanation and Research Department before actually writing its introduction. Writing this article was a bit of a problem as it needed to be something Explained that still required an anti-Kinetohazard task force. And I really wanted to write a kinetohazard fight scene. I settled for an ultimately unnecessary long fight scene, that&#39;s not really needed and a legal disaster to explain how it got the Explained designation. It&#39;s also set in Broken Masquerade, which is nice.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+Writing History &#34; hide=&#34;-Writing History&#34;]]

[[[Writing History]]] - Another Contest entry. This time for the [[[Canon Renaissance Contest]]] with my team Well Versed for Bellerverse (the story is still being worked on in case anyone wants to know). It took a bit before I found the right voice for this one, but I had fun writing it after I did. Reimagining how things worked out after the world ended is a lot of fun. I&#39;m a bit bumped, that nobody tried to find out which SCPs are hidden in the tale, but I suppose the site doesn&#39;t do that anymore.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+A Working Theory &#34; hide=&#34;-A Working Theory &#34;]]

[[[A Working Theory]]] - This was a gift I made in the [[[art-exchange-hub | 2020 Art Exchange]]] for Connor MacWarren. I tried to structure this a bit like an episode of a SciFi TV show akin to Doctor Who and such. A lot of unresolved SciFi-mystery at the start with steadily rising tension, a hopefully understandable technobabble solution that resolves the mystery, and a cliffhanger for the next episode.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+SCP-5582 - Hard-to-Contain Octopus &#34; hide=&#34;-SCP-5582 - Hard-to-Contain Octopus &#34;]]

[[[SCP-5582]]] - Another Article for a contest (Do you see a pattern yet?), this time [[[Jam-Con 2021]]]. As is probably clear from the title this was a soft reimagining/satire of SCP-682, with the main difference being that the Foundation fails to fulfil its primary mission of containment here instead of trying to kill it. In my first draft of this almost every line or formatting was a direct or indirect jab at the SCP-682 article, but I got a bit away from that to better make room for the life-affirming message this article now (hopefully) conveys. The result is a bit messy and I want to rewrite this, but got a lot of crit that goes in different directions, so I&#39;m a bit unsure what to do with this for now.

EDIT: I got around to rewriting the end. It should still come through that 5582 is too old for anything, but still just has fun in mind. I&#39;m very happy with the new ending.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+Of Memes and Counterconcepts &#34; hide=&#34;-Of Memes and Counterconcepts &#34;]]

[[[Of Memes and Counterconcepts]]] - My second Jamcon 2021 entry. This is also the first step into my headcanon of how I imagine the bureaucracy surrounding the First Memetics Department lashes out. I tried to do something similar to A Working Theory regarding the TV show structure, but I think that worked out better for A Working Theory. I think it&#39;s okay, but it&#39;s definitely the weakest of my 2021 Jamcon entries. Having only a few hours for this didn&#39;t help.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+SC-02/000-22/000: Insurance  &#34; hide=&#34;-SC-02/000-22/000: Insurance  &#34;]]

[[[SC-02/000-22/000]]] - My third 2021 Jamcon article, that actually won and got featured![[size 80%]] In a category with only one other contestant.[[/size]] I only realized after the end that this jamcon didn&#39;t have any restrictions like &#34;1 SCP, 1 Tale, and 1 GOI-format&#34; like the last one, but I think I&#39;ll continue doing it that way for future jamcons because it&#39;s a fun restriction. I&#39;m actually a bit bumped that this one has no comments despite being featured and doing well (as of the time I&#39;m writing this). I think right now this is probably the article from me that is most likely to build upon by other authors, which is one of the main ideas here. That&#39;s why I tried to introduce multiple CI cell leaders (and with it different CI versions) to give the Insurgency a more cohesive feeling. I&#39;m especially happy with having a sort of pataphysics character (Linda Liesmith) that doesn&#39;t really take up much of the spotlight with pataphysics shenanigans. The other idea I had here was basically the Chaos Insurgency&#39;s answer to SCP-2000 (which the title number is a reference to): A dead man switch that unleashes dozens of methods to end the world simultaneously. It was also fun to look SCPs up the Insurgency could use to end the world efficiently. I think I did the format more justice than I did on my first try.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+SCP-5187 - Standard Procedure &#34; hide=&#34;-SCP-5187 - Standard Procedure  &#34;]]

[[[SCP-5187]]] - This one was not posted for a contest! There are a few ideas that culminated into this article. Mainly the idea of an SCP file that shows the &#34;normal&#34; life of an SCP object from beginning to end, in this case, the end is being fully researched and then archived. And more introduction of the First Memetics Department that is adamant to adhere to the &#34;good old days&#34; of Foundation research and how they have standardized some horrible acts. The latter is probably a bit invisible as this is a thing the average SCP reader is oversaturated with. The article also includes a snippet of my genuine fear of being lost in the vastness of space. I also tried a bit of using &#34;word fields&#34; like how the researcher notes talk a lot about &#34;cleanly- and pureness&#34;. Includes also yet another reference to ExaRD before its actual introduction.

I like to think of this article as furniture. It&#39;s not really that interesting, but it is well built and that is how I want it to be.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+SCP-5226 - Progress Explained &#34; hide=&#34;-SCP-5226 - Progress Explained  &#34;]]

[[[SCP-5226]]] - And now finally the introduction to the Explanation and Research Department. I originally wanted to introduce ExaRD in an Orientation, but that one had a lot of problems, so I introduced it here and later with a Site Dossier. It could still be a bit better, but I&#39;m happy with how this one turned out. The actual SCP is extremely simple and really just a metaphor (sort of) for the conflict between Roberts and Weld. I&#39;m also happy with the fact that both Characters have a somewhat understandable position and not only Weld how it was originally. The actual SCP object also serves as a nice compromise for their argument and how neither would have discovered the full truth if it wasn&#39;t for their discussion.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+SCP-6016 - When Elephants Still Did Magic&#34; hide=&#34;-SCP-6016 - When Elephants Still Did Magic &#34;]]

[[[SCP-6016]]] - And now my entry for [[[scp6000contesthub | 6kon]]]. If there is one thing that bothers me about this one a bit it&#39;s how unclear the GOC&#39;s intentions are, even though I intended it that way. That&#39;s because one of the ideas I wanted to present here is that the Foundation is a bit out of its depth and this is an anomaly that&#39;s really more suited for the GOC. Otherwise, I&#39;m very happy with the scope of this. I played a bit around with the format by having each sub anomaly with its own little Containment Procedures and such. There&#39;s also the idea here of how magical evolution (or nature) looks without human influence and how this changes after interactions with both the children of the night and later different human groups. A lot of things are only alluded to and I hope this evokes a bit of Series I feel (the good kind). Also go read the Wikipedia article about [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_cognition | Elephant cognition]]]. It&#39;s a good read (I know that&#39;s a weird thing to say about a Wikipedia article).

[[[SCP-6401]]] - This is the culmination of multiple ideas I had for a very long time. The first was a court that judges natural laws instead of human ones, and the idea that the taboo-Fae have seasonal Courts. An idea that is often seen with media surrounding Fae, that I felt was missing from the Wiki. I chose Autumn because that&#39;s my favourite season (birthday-related) and an often lesser focused one.  And in Autumn 2021 I felt I was experienced enough to do the idea justice. I wanted to expand a bit from other Fae-lore on the wiki, but it also takes inspiration from the IS and IS NOT stuff, which I made part of the judicial cycle system. I like the result and will likely post more cycle of seasons related stuff on other equinox or solstices.

[[[Reporting On The Front]]] - The first tale that focuses solely on ExaRD, or rather the unveiled side of it. I&#39;ve got the idea from a prompt from Placeholder McD of a civilian researcher employed at the Front finding out stuff. It ended up being an interview by a civilian instead. It sets up some things I&#39;d like to play with at a later point. It&#39;s also the introduction of Agent Purple Tie from the Disinformation Bureau a fun character who I also have some more plans for.

I just ask that nothing from me be outright deleted as long as it&#39;s not rule-breaking or under -10. Thank you
