**Containment Procedures:**
SCP-6629 is to be stored in a standard containment locker at Site-18. Testing of SCP-6629 requires a minimum of 1 clearance level 4 personnel supervising. Removal of SCP-6629 apart from testing procedures is prohibited.

**Description:**
SCP-6629 is a pair of standard-issue United Airlines headphones available for sale to passengers.
Unconscious subjects wearing SCP-6629 will vanish for varying lengths of time. Recorded lengths range from 6 to 8 hours. Said subjects will be transported to a pocket dimension comprised of a long, dimly lit corridor with doors on the right wall. The aforementioned doors lead to adjacent rooms each containing a single, motionless instance of the transported subject[[footnote]]From now on referred to as SCP-6629-1[[/footnote]]. Previously unconscious subjects are conscious after being transported to the pocket dimension. After 6 to 8 hours subjects reappear in the process of regaining consciousness. No memories of the disappearance can be recalled by subjects.

**Discovery:**
SCP-6629 was discovered on 14/05/2021 during a transatlantic flight from London to New York. A Foundation agent planted in Air Traffic Control noticed an uncommon missing report of a first-class passenger mid-flight. The passenger was missing from his first-class cabin for approximately 6 hours until reappearing in the said cabin, waking up. All civilians involved were issued Class B amnestics.

**Subject: D-8921**
[[div style=&#34;padding: 5px; border: double black 1px; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 5px;&#34;]]
**Hypotheses:**
H,,1,,: Subjects introduced to SCP-6629 stimulus cease existence during disappearance.

**Procedures:**
D-8921 is equipped with vital functions monitoring sensors. SCP-6629 was placed on the subject’s head after the subject fell asleep.

**Results:**
D-8921 disappeared for 7 hours. Data retrieved from carried hard drive upon subjects reappearance. Readout data shows 7 hours of vital activity. Recorded heart rate significantly higher than expected resting heart rate. The subject can not recollect any events after falling asleep.
H,,1,, falsified.

**Researcher note:**
Recorded vital activity does not only imply transportation of the subject but also that the D-Class was awake during his disappearance.
I just hope we did not find yet another transportation thing.

**Hypotheses:**

H,,3,,: Subject is being transported to another location on Earth.

**Procedures:**
D-8921 is equipped with a GPS tracker and communication devices wireless connected to the observation chamber.

**Audio-Log:**
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Dr. Theseus:** D-8921, can you hear us? Can you confirm where you are?

**D-8921:** Yeah, yeah, I can hear you. I’m in the same room, Dr. T.

**Dr. Theseus:** Negative. We can not confirm that on our part. Please proceed to describe to us your whereabouts.

**D-8921:** It’s still the same room, Dr. T.

**Dr. Theseus:** Describe the room us, D-8921. Nothing more, nothing less.

//D-8921 sighs//

**D-8921:** Fine. It’s the same soulless gray, concrete room you put me into. There is the same uncomfortable bed and your giant one-way mirror. I guess the door changed? I suppose you didn’t change your usual foot-thick metal frames with wooden doors while I slept?

**Dr. Theseus:** No, we did not. Open the door and describe to us what you see outside the room.

**D-8921:** Nothing more, nothing less, huh? Time to say my prayers.

//A squeaking sound//

**D-8921:** Oh boy, it&#39;s a long fucking hallway and a dimly lit one at that.

**Dr. Theseus:** Anything else seemingly abnormal?

**D-8921:** Ehm, it&#39;s very long, like, “I don’t see an end” -long. With many doors on my right. To be honest here Dr. Theseus, I want to get back to my uncomfortable bed.

**Dr. Theseus:** Negative. Please proceed to the next door.

//D-8921 Sighs//

**D-8921:** Okay, let&#39;s go.

//A squeaking sound//

//D-8921 breathing heavily//

**D-8921:** It’s my cell, just with th-

//D-8921 stuttering// 

**D-8921:** The addition of my fucking corpse.

**Dr. Theseus:** Cause of death?

**D-8921:** Strangulation. There are even marks.

**Dr. Theseus:** Thank you. Please proceed to the next door.

//A squeaking sound//

**D-8921:** It’s the gray testing room again, Theseus. No corpse in here.

**Dr. Theseus:** I suppose you know what to do?

**D-8921:** To the next door, I guess.

**Dr. Theseus:** You are a fast learner, D-8921.

//A Squeaking sound, D-8921 breathing heavily//

**D-8921:** It’s another cell with my very dead corpse, Doc. As far as I can judge, no difference to room 2.

//6 hours of recording omitted for brevity//

**D-8921:** I can&#39;t anymore, Dr. T. This was like the 300th corpse-ridden cell. I’m so exhausted that I&#39;m starting to see lights. I will just lean against this wall and rest my eyes for a while.

**Dr. Theseus**: We conclude this test at this point. You may relax. Well done, D-8921.

GPS data shows no change in location. Real-time communication could be established to the subject. The bit rate of transmission is low and unstable. The usage of video transmissions is questionable.
H,,2,, proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
H,,3,, falsified.

**Researcher notes:**
It does seem, that we do have something more interesting here. Our assumptions were wrong. We have classified the subject&#39;s destination as a pocket dimension and the subject&#39;s corpses as SCP-6629-1.  

Why is there no corpse in room number 3? My best guess is that there are no corpses in rooms in which the subject enters the pocket dimension. We should test that hypothesis.
Finally, something to do. We still have a lot to learn.

**Hypotheses:**
H,,4,,: Physical stimuli on the subject&#39;s body while in the pocket dimension affects the subject&#39;s body previously sleeping in the testing chamber. A possible mechanism to wake up the subject.
H,,5,,: SCP-6629-1 missing in rooms in which the subject entered the pocket dimension.

**Procedures:**
A stun device was added to D-8921. Administrating a painful, but harmless electric shock. Administration of the electric shock by a button on the device, easily accessible by the subject.
Testing took place in D-8921&#39;s cell.

**D-8921:** Doctor, I need to stop. There is another corpse.

**Dr. Theseus:** Did you enter a room against my orders?

**D-8921:** No. I didn&#39;t. It&#39;s leaning against the wall in the corridor.

**Dr. Theseus:** Cause of death?

**D-8921:** Also strangulation.

**Dr. Theseus:** Anything else to note?

**D-8921:** It has a radio and a tag on its overall. //Dr. Theseus test number two dash 6629//

**D-8921:** Doc, are you still here?

**D-8921:** Doc!

**Dr. Theseus:** Sorry, I was absent-minded. Please proceed with your task.

//5 hours of recordings omitted for brevity//

**D-8921:** Is there anything dangerous at the end of the hallway?

**Dr. Theseus:** We don&#39;t know for sure.

**D-8921:** Wow, that&#39;s botherso-

//D-8921 gasps//

**D-8921:** Doc, what&#39;s that?

**Dr. Theseus:** Please elaborate on //that//.

**D-8921:** Holy shit! Doc, it&#39;s walking towards me!

**Dr. Theseus:** D-8921, explain-

//Audio unrecognizable//

**D-8921:** Thank god, it&#39;s down.

**Dr. Theseus:** It?

**D-8921:** Me, Doc. //Me//! It looked exactly like me and tried to strangle me! Fuck. I hit my head pretty bad, I think I&#39;m bleeding.

**Dr. Theseus:** We will treat you after the experiment. Check the closest room to you and we will get you out of there.

**D-8921:** Oh dear god, thank you. Really.

//A squeaking sound//

**Dr. Theseus:** What do you see?

**D-8921:** It&#39;s a child&#39;s bedroom. My old bedroom. Even Mr. Spotty is there.

//D-8921 sighs//

**D-8921:** Better times.

**Dr. Theseus:** Please, hurry up. Anything else to note?

**D-8921:** There is something under the blanket.

//D-8921 gasps//

**D-8921:** This is cruel. Just cruel.

**Dr. Theseus:** Elaborate.

**D-8921:** There is a child. Dead. Maybe 6 years old. 23 years younger, but definitely me. Strangled.

**Dr. Theseus:** D-8921, we need to end this experiment immediately.

**D-8921:** Doc, why are there strangulation marks?

**Dr. Theseus:** I will explain everything to you after your extraction.

**D-8921:** How do I //extract// then?

**Dr. Theseus:** There is a little device with a button on your belt. Press the button.

**D-8921:** Let&#39;s do it.

//Electric shock administered to D-8921//

**Dr. Theseus:** This can&#39;t be true. It mustn&#39;t be.

D-8921 reached room 8342 before an undesignated entity [[footnote]] Provisionally designated SCP-6629-2 [[/footnote]] attacked him. The final room reached approximately 8400.
D-8921 reappeared after the activation of the electric stimulus.
H,,4,, proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
H,,5,, falsified.

**Researcher notes:**
After some thought and some research into D-8921&#39;s upbringing in Foundation custody, I could draft the following table.

||~ DATE ||= 02/06 ||= 03/06 ||= 04/06 ||= 05/06||
||~ ROOMS OBSERVED [[footnote]] Put in relation to the expected date under the assumption of a regress [[/footnote]] ||= Observation ||= Cell ||= Observation ||= Cell||
||~ ROOMS D-8921 SLEPT IN ||= Observation ||= Cell ||= Observation ||= Cell||
||~ TEST ||= #1 ||= None ||= #2 ||= #3 ||
||~ CORPSE||= None ||= Corpse ||= None ||= None ||


My assumption that this whole pocket dimension is a regress of D-8921&#39;s former sleeping accommodations appears to be true. This hypothesis is only strengthened by the 23 year age gap between SCP-6629-1 instances roughly 8400 rooms apart.
If this whole pocket dimension is a regress and is expanding one room a day, 8395 rooms are to be expected in 23 years. 8400 is //definitely// in the margin of error.

Sinister hypotheses are plaguing my thoughts.
Why couldn&#39;t SCP-6629 just have been yet another transportation thing?
This is Site-18 for christ&#39;s sake. I can&#39;t handle this. All of this is way over my experience.

Someone help me.

**Subjects: D-8921, D-4745***
[[div style=&#34;padding: 5px; border: double black 1px; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 5px;&#34;]]
**Hypotheses:**
H,,6,,: SCP-6629-2 attacks subjects transported into the pocket dimension.
H,,7,,: SCP-6629-1 instances retrofitted according to subject&#39;s memories wearing SCP-6629.

**Procedures:**
Subject D-8921 was put to sleep in a standard observation chamber. After the subject falls asleep D-4745 is introduced to the observation chamber and ordered to sleep. Checks of facility records show that D-8921 was never in contact with D-4745.
D-8921 was equipped with a Beretta M9 pistol, as I, Dr. Theseus, wished for.
After D-8921 and D-4745 successfully fall asleep, SCP-6629 is to be introduced to D-8921.

**Results:**

**Audio log:**
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Dr. Theseus:** D-8921, I need you to wake up fast. Have you ever met this D-Class?

//D-8921 yawning//

**D-8921:** You mean the sleeping guy in the D-Class overall on the other bed? No.

**Dr. Theseus:** Impossible. You woke up after we brought him in, didn&#39;t you?

**D-8921:** Holy shit, Doc. No, I haven&#39;t. I don&#39;t know what you are talking about. You are scaring me, to be honest, Dr. Theseus.

//Dr. Theseus voice starts trembling//

**D-8921:** Doc?

**Dr. Theseus:** I. I am still here.

**D-8921:** Oh thank god, I thought I was trapped in this nightmare alone.

**Dr. Theseus:** Yes. I think //nightmare// fits well.

**Dr. Theseus:**  Grab your gun and wait. You will know when to contact me again. I need some time alone to think.

**D-8921:** Okay, Doc.

//4 hours of recordings omitted for brevity//

**D-8921:** Doctor, I think it&#39;s time!

**Dr. Theseus:** What do you see?

**D-8921:** I see light orbs forming something. I think it&#39;s a human. No. Two humans, right outside the door.

**Dr. Theseus:** Ready your weapon.

**D-8921:** Oh my god, is it dangerous?

**Dr. Theseus:** Just ready your weapon and wait for orders.

**D-8921:** Doc. I think I know what these things are.

**Dr. Theseus:** You and D-4745?

**D-8921:** If this fellow D-Class over there is the so-called D-4745. Yes.

**Dr. Theseus:** Tell me what these copies do. If yours is too close to you: Shoot it.

//D-8921 voice trembles//

**D-8921:** Doc! This D-whatever copy is strangling the sleeping guy.

**Dr. Theseus:** Don&#39;t interfere.

//Gun being cocked//

**D-8921:** Oh shit. It&#39;s coming near.

**Dr. Theseus:** Yes! You //will// watch. 

//Shots fired//

**D-8921:** It was me, Doc. Ignoring this lad and coming straight at me.

//D-8921 exhales//

**Dr. Theseus:** Status on D-4745?

//Shot fired, Gun clicks//

**Dr. Theseus:** //What the fuck// did you do?

//D-8921 starts crying//

**D-8921:** I. I think it&#39;s over.

//D-8921 sobs//

**D-8921:** I only hit its arm with the last bullet.

**Dr. Theseus:** Elaborate, Goddammit!

**D-8921:** This other D-Class. He is dead. This, this thing. Its hands glowed around the lad&#39;s throat. Sucking the life out of him.

//D-8921 sobbing//

**D-8921:** Walking straight out of the room when it finished.

**D-8921:** I want to go home.

**Dr. Theseus:** I&#39;m sorry.

D-8921 disappeared and D-4745 remained in the observation chamber.
D-8921 reappeared after 7 hours. D-4745 woke up after 8 without any memory regarding the events in the pocket dimension. No strangulation marks are visible. D-4745 showed signs of a shot wound on his lower arm.
H,,6,, proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
H,,7,, falsified.

**Researcher notes:**

**Video log of Dr. Theseus:**

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
//Dr. Theseus sits at his office table. Puffy eyes visible//

So this was my first human sacrifice for the glorious ways of science, huh?
What D-8921 described frightens me.
My nightmarish theses appear to be true with only little room for doubt left.
But I still cling to this doubt. I have to. Because it just //mustn&#39;t// be true.

//Dr. Theseus drinks coffee//

All of the evidence directs us to believe that these events unfolded many, many times before the subject was even introduced to SCP-6629. The thought that is hunting me is a certain hunch. That this has nothing to do with SCP-6629 after all. That these events unfolded to us all, many, many times before.
This whole thing is way more than this goddamn SCP. It //has// to be.
Why did it have to be this way? Why couldn&#39;t we realize this earlier? Why did an inexperienced researcher like me have to experiment on it?
Just a fucking clearance 3, that only had to work around stupid anomalous objects before.

//Dr. Theseus sighs//

Now I&#39;m just rambling. Fuck, I need to record this again.
I just have to watch out to not fall asleep. I can&#39;t sleep. I don&#39;t want to be replaced by //it//.

[End of log]
[[/div]]

**Additional notes:**

2 days ago we finished test number 4. This means day 3 without sleep. For me and D-8921.
Me, because the thought of sleeping frightens me. D-8921, because they can&#39;t.
They lost their ability to sleep after test number 4.
The health of the D-Class is rapidly deteriorating.
Not long until they die. Not long until I fall asleep.
Even though the means are different, the results are the same. Death.

I just need to test my last hypothesis.
Maybe I am wrong after all.
Right?
//Right?//

**Subject: D-5643**
[[div style=&#34;padding: 5px; border: double black 1px; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 5px;&#34;]]
**Hypotheses:**
H,,8,,: The pocket dimension is no part of SCP-6629. SCP-6629 transports/ties the physical body to its consciousness.

**Procedures:**
Acquisition of subject D-5643. Cross test of SCP-████ with the aforementioned subject after establishing a SCP-6629 stimulus.
SCP-████ is a gold ring that makes its wearer unconscious for exactly 20 minutes. The consciousness of the subject is being transported to a pocket dimension containing a recreation of events, not older than 3 years, that resulted in at least 10 human casualties. Subjects regain consciousness after 20 minutes and remember events unfolding in the aforementioned pocket dimension.
Subject introduced to SCP-6629. After that introduction to SCP-████.

**Results:**
The subject disappears and reappears after 20 minutes. The subject remembers being transported to a containment breach at Site-19 that took place 3 weeks ago.

H,,8,, proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Researcher notes:**

**Video log of Dr. Theseus:**
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
//Dr. Theseus sits at his office table, facing the camera. Deep, dark circles are visible under his eyes//

This fucking headset was just another transportation thing after all. Just with the added gimmick to transport someone to where one&#39;s consciousness is being transported to.

//Dr. Theseus inhales loudly//

We regrettably left one constant in our tests untouched. Funnily, out of pure budget constraints. We-

//Voice crack, throat clearing//

We could, unfortunately, not justify inducing an artificial coma into our test subjects if there was an easier accessible alternative. Using only sleeping subjects has cost us precious time and blinded us.
We were blind to the possibility that our normalcy itself can be anomalous.
The pocket dimension and its anomalous properties are

//mild laughing//

funnily enough, not intrinsic to SCP-6629.
The true source of this pocket dimension is the constant we left untouched during our experiments. Sleep.
My nightmarish hypothesis was true after all.

//Dr. Theseus looks with a stern look into the camera//

We aren&#39;t able to neutralize sleep, but we should try our best to substitute it. No matter the chances of mass panic, I shall inform my colleagues of my findings and start working on a cure.   

Failure is not an option.
