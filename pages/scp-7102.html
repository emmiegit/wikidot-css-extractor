**Item #:** SCP-7102

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7102 is to be stored in a small titanium container located in Site 23, which is required for prolonged containment. No personnel is permitted to interact with SCP-6957, regardless of their class. Under no circumstances is SCP-7102 to be reunited with SCP-7102-1, as prolonged exposure to each other is grounds for immediate worldwide disarray and the extinction of humanity. SCP-7102-1 is secured by Guatemalan SCP personnel, trespassing upon the site will result in immediate termination. On their own, SCP-7102 and SCP-7102-1 seem to show no anomalous properties, and will not affect anything. It is only when both are in contact with each other that the anomaly with occur.

**Description:**SCP-7102 is a smooth rock comprised of granite, with a spiral-shaped carving across the top surface. SCP-7102 acts as a key for SCP-7102-1, an altar located in Guatemala, which dates back to early Mayan civilisations. It is theorised that both artifacts were to be used in religious offerings to a god of some form, according to symbols carved on nearby architecture. Upon placing SCP-7102 into the hole of SCP-7102, (both together of which will hereby be classed under SCP-7102-2), a vortex will emanate from the site. Mammalians exposed to the radiations of SCP-7102-2 will undergo a distortion. 

Following the distortions, the subject will produce its own vortex, which contains the same properties as SCP-7102-2. As of the time of writing, there is no way to cure this effect and infected subjects will be terminated.

SCP-7102 and SCP7102-1 were located after several reports of an extremely infectious disease that causes people&#39;s faces to twist into a spiral. The virus seemingly appeared in a span of 15 minutes, 47 people were already infected. SCP personnel were dispatched, and the source was found to be SCP-7102-2. SCP-7102-2 was dismantled, and all infected civilians were terminated and tested upon. And strong amnestics were administered to the remaining population of Guatemala.

**TEST 7102-A** 


**Foreword:**Remote autopsy report upon an unknown multiracial man. Age approximated to be late 20s. Upon examining the subject&#39;s skull, it was found that major bone reformation had taken place. The skull was emanating a faint hum. Dr. Henson, who was the lead operator, described feeling a sense of distress upon hearing this hum. Dr. Henson later demonstrated feelings of distress comparable to that of depression, and begged for the personnel to terminate him. Request was denied. Dr. Henson is currently in counselling and should return to a stable mental state with time. As for the skull, the properties are still currently being studied, but disposal of the skull with fire seems to stop the effect.


**Result:** Dispose of any remains of infected people following procedure 7102-2-B. [See report 7102-2-B for more context]
