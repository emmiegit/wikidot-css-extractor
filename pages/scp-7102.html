**Item #:** SCP-7102

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7102 is to be placed within a small leather box which is to be placed in a simple containment cell with a standard lock.

**Description:** SCP-7102 is a small, red, 4 by 2 stud lego brick. SCP-7102 is currently being contained at Site ██. Tests done on SCP-7102 reveal that once a living human has made physical contact with the object it will stick to their skin and will be impossible very difficult to remove. Once removed, SCP-7102 will begin to emit hissing sounds, it will continue to do this for about 20 minutes after which it will stop. If the subject who touched the brick is wearing shoes a cluster of up to 8 different LEGO bricks will appear within the subject&#39;s shoes causing physical damage to the subject&#39;s foot. Research has shown that SCP-7102 is made up of a mixture of plastic and sheep blood.

**Addendum:**  9/15/20██: SCP-7102 was first discovered within Construction Worker ████&#39;s apartment. The anomalous properties of the object were first discovered by Dr. █████. SCP-7102 was then moved to Site ██ for testing.

**Test Log 1:** 9/18/20██: SCP-7102 was placed on a white table in a small room. D-2013-17 was sent into the room and commanded to pick up SCP-7102. Upon getting touched the object stuck to D-2013-17&#39;s hand and would not come off. Researcher Dr. Andrew Pole was able to remove SCP-7102 using soap and water. After approximately 2 minutes SCP-7102 reportedly began to emit hissing sounds from within it&#39;s cell. After 18 minutes the hissing stopped and D-2013-17&#39;s shoes were filled with 6 different lego bricks, causing him to yell in pain. Testing revealed that there was nothing anomalous about the six bricks which appeared inside of D-2013-17&#39;s shoes.

**Test Log 2:** 9/20/20██: D-2013-17 was instructed to touch SCP-7102 once again, however this time researchers had him take off his shoes. D-2013-17 reluctantly touched the brick again. Once again SCP-6298 stuck to his hand and would not come off. Dr. Pole instructed D-2013-17 to leave SCP-7102 on his hand. After nearly 40 minutes nothing had happened so the brick was removed. No bricks were inside of D-2013-17&#39;s shoes, so he was allowed to put them back on. However, upon putting his shoes back on, they were once again filled with 4 different bricks.

**Test Log 3:** 9/25/20██: D-2013-17 was fitted with a pair of leather gloves, he was instructed to pick up SCP-7102. Upon touching the Brick, it did not stick to the glove. After 20 minutes, D-2013-17&#39;s shoes were not filled up with bricks.

{{After testing had ended. SCP-7102 was moved to site██ for containment. The brick was labeled as safe class and stored away in containment.}}

**The following is an interview by Dr. David Price with Construction Worker ████ who had found SCP-7102 in his apartment**

++++ Interview
&gt; Dr. Price: &#34;So ████, tell me about the brick.&#34;
&gt; ████: &#34;Well, it was somewhere in September, I had just gotten back to my apartment after a long day of work, I got some coffee and sat down to watch my favorite game show as usual. That was when I saw it, it was just sitting there on the floor in front of my TV. I stooped lower to see what it was, it was a LEGO brick, the original type I think.&#34;
&gt; Dr. Price: &#34;It was just sitting there? Do you have any idea how it got there?&#34;
&gt; ████: &#34;No not at all, I had never owned LEGOs before, not even as a kid… I have no clue how it got there, but when I picked it up it stuck to my hand like glue and just wouldn&#39;t come off.&#34;
&gt; Dr. Price: &#34;It stuck to your hand? How did you get it off?&#34;
&gt; ████: &#34;I tried to use butter to get it off but it wouldn&#39;t budge, I kept trying and it finally came off. The next day I woke up to find three LEGOs in my shoes. It was weird though, because I didn&#39;t see the LEGOs in there until I had already put them on. And yes, it was painful.&#34;
&gt; Dr. Price: &#34;Alright I think that&#39;s all I need to know for now… you can go home now.&#34;
&gt; ████: &#34;That&#39;s it?&#34;
&gt; Dr. Price: &#34;Yes ████, we are done here, thank you.&#34;

--████was not given amnesties as it would have been unnecessary and a waist of resources--
████was later given amnesties by order of Dr. ████.

__SCP-7102 is very low on priorities, testing has ceased and access to SCP-7102 is restricted to personnel with lvl 2 clearance.__</textarea></pre>
