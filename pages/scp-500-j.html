**Item #:** SCP-500-J

**Object Class**: --Super-- Keter 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-500 is to be kept in the Primary Containment Zone of Containment Area 25b replacing SCP-076 with her mouth covered at all times (the original duct tape has since been replaced). For the time being SCP-076 has been placed in the 3rd floor janitor&#39;s closet, security for which will be provided by Scruffy, the head of Area 25b janitorial staff. All previous security measures have been doubled, with an extra 4 Nuclear devices provided to the base arsenal just in case. 

**Description:** SCP-500, formerly known as [DATA EXPUNGED], is a --malevolent harpy hell bent on destroying anything in its path-- female human possessing a wide range of abilities. Those described to base staff are: 
* Reducing any adult male to tears.
* Creating an urge to kill oneself --one of these days I swear--
* Causing addiction to a wide array of alcoholic beverages --I just can&#39;t face that bitch sober--
* A death glare at any passing female --I happen to glance at but it doesn&#39;t mean anything for god&#39;s sake-- which has been assured to the research team to result in the death of said female.
* The ability to track no matter --where I am-- the location.
* The ability to attempt communication at the worst possible time --I mean, c&#39;mon it&#39;s not that kind of massage parlor I swear--
* An intuitive ability to tell when someone is lying and deconstruct the entire lie --resulting in sleeping on the damn couch while the fucking dog gets my spot in bed.-- 
* Causing a massive mental breakdown of any male --that not even drugs can help, oh yeah I&#39;ve tried. You&#39;re better off with a gun in my opinion--
* Arguing for up to several hours --by which time I just say whatever will let me get back to the damn game before it&#39;s over.--
* --She was able to pull one hell of a [DATA EXPUNGED] position just like [DATA EXPUNGED][DATA EXPUNGED][DATA EXPUNGED][DATA EXPUNGED], but fuck that.--

By order of O5-8, SCP-500 is to simply be contained with no testing.

It should be noted that all required SCP documentation and revised security plans were provided by O5-8 who assured the on-site command staff that the entire O5 council approved the new procedures. O5-8 also mentioned that the current communication blackout will be lifted as soon as possible.

**Side note:** SCP-076-2 awoke in his temporary containment to find a portable DVD player playing Deadliest Warrior non-stop. This placated SCP-076-2 long enough to allow security to restrain him. For his efforts in containing SCP-076-2, Scruffy as been promoted to head of Area 25b security.</textarea></pre>
