My daughter&#39;s head rests on my chest. I sit against her headboard. I found her on her side. Eyes closed, her mouth open. 

I used to find her that way on days after swim lessons when she was younger. Asleep in front of the TV with an airhead wrapper and wet hair. I&#39;d pick her up and carry her to bed. There are bigger things to worry about than sleeping in your swimsuit.

This time I carry her from her bed. Like I do every morning. She would protest. She always wanted more time to sleep. She was more and more tired every time. But the world couldn&#39;t wait on us.

I squeeze her little body to feel the warmth she has left. It must&#39;ve been just before I went to wake her up.

-----
I fit as many kisses as I can in her messy hair and place her down on her special chair in the shower. She covered it with stickers that melted off slowly over time. I make sure the water is warm. I try my best to keep it away from her feet while it&#39;s still cold. She hates the sprinkles of cold water. 

This time I put her in her bathrobe, trim her nails, and put her hair up in the fancy towel turban she loves.

We never had time for that before. The world couldn&#39;t wait on us.

-----

I pick up her chair this time and carry her out of the shower. I place her down in front of the mirror and pick up the brush. She hadn&#39;t let me touch the mat on the back of her head all week. She was too tired to get out of bed. I didn&#39;t want her to feel any more pain anyway.

I hold her hand and promise I&#39;ll be gentle.

I work slowly. Much slower than on days we rushed out of the house to be there on time. Days we&#39;d fight over it. She&#39;d thrash and kick and I&#39;d yell at her to sit still.

She used to ask me to do one of those fancy braids. The kind she got done at a fair once. But by that point, we&#39;d already be late for her appointment. I&#39;d tell her the world can&#39;t wait on us and hurry her into the car.

-----

I work on her hair from the bottom up, part by part, holding it towards her scalp so it doesn&#39;t tug. So she can&#39;t feel it. 

When I&#39;m finished I stare at her in the mirror. I lean forward to hold her as tight as I can. I let myself cry in front of her just this once.

We don&#39;t have to rush today. The phone calls can wait. The organizing can wait. They don&#39;t have to take her just yet.

I have time to braid her hair today.
