&gt; *** **CoolGuy95 has joined __#post-phenomart__**
&gt; 
&gt; **Welcome to Post-Phenom Art - RULES: www.pastebin.com/GHeXgyQW | Topic: Non-Euclidean Sculptures: Overdone or Underdone?**
&gt; **Topic set by TheEntirePolishArmy on Sat Jan 11 2012 00:47:55 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)**
&gt; 
&gt; **Phenylalanine:** so baisically you just need to work on your shadding
&gt; **blusepth:** okay
&gt; **Phenylalanine:** hey coolguy, welcome to postphenom. you&#39;re new here right?
&gt; **CoolGuy95:** Hello people. I&#39;m new. 
&gt; **jorgumander:** ASK HIM THE QUESTIONS!
&gt; **blusepth:** ASK! ASK!
&gt; **CoolGuy95:** questions?
&gt; **Phenylalanine:** 1. WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE PIECE OF POST-PHENOM ART?
&gt; **Phenylalanine:** 2. HAVE YOU EVER CREATED ANY POST-PHENOM ART YOURSELF?
&gt; **Phenylalanine:** 3. HOW DID YOU FIND US?
&gt; **CoolGuy95:** I would say Stendhal&#39;s Nightmare.
&gt; **CoolGuy95:** No, and a friend of mine mentioned you guys. 
&gt; **blusepth:** Who?
&gt; **CoolGuy95:** She said her username is autotrophic or something like that.
&gt; **Phenylalanine:** Ah, you&#39;re with autotrophia. She&#39;s cool. 
&gt; **Phenylalanine:** Well, the initiation is complete. your free to go
&gt; **blusepth:** ONE OF US.
&gt; **jackomundo:** ONE OF US.
&gt; **CoolGuy95:** So you guys are Are We Cool Yet?, right?
&gt; **blusepth:** ah hell noes
&gt; **jackomundo:** nope
&gt; **Phenylalanine:** No
&gt; **CoolGuy95:** but, I thought you guys did post-phenomenological art?
&gt; **jackomundo:** well yes
&gt; **CoolGuy95:** i thought that was kind of AWCY?&#39;s thing.
&gt; **Phenylalanine:** We do post-phenom art, but we&#39;re not AWCY. You can&#39;t really be AWCY. It&#39;s like, a kind of meme really. 
&gt; **blusepth:** AWCY? is definitely not cool.
&gt; **Phenylalanine:** Everyone is really damn tired of AWCY jokes.
&gt; **CoolGuy95:** okay
&gt; **jackomundo:** .tell AWritingDesk http://i.imgur.com/bnCs3.jpg
&gt; **VanGogh:** Acknowledged.
&gt; **Phenylalanine:** So we&#39;ve moved away from using AWCY in just about anything. It&#39;s an old, worn out joke that no one laughs at anymore.
&gt; **blusepth:** Also, AWCY? kind of got used by people who used post-phenom art in a way we don&#39;t really approve of. Like Stendhal&#39;s Nightmare. What&#39;s the point of making beautiful art if people can&#39;t appreciate it without dying or going crazy?
&gt; **jackomundo:** ^
&gt; **Phenylalanine:** These days, not many people do much of that &#34;edgy&#34; crap. At least not in our little circle. 
&gt; **CoolGuy95:** I really didn&#39;t know all this, I just heard a little about AWCY and I thought it was interesting. I figured it would be a good way to expand my experience in art.
&gt; **Phenylalanine:** Its fine
&gt; **jorgumander:** yea, you&#39;re new here after all. can we see some of the stuff you&#39;ve done before?
&gt; **CoolGuy95:** Sure. let me dig some of this stuf up
&gt; **Epimonsterous has joined __#post-phenomart__**
&gt; **CoolGuy95:** it&#39;s not post-phenom, but here it is: http://i.imgur.com/AD9Lz.jpg
&gt; **Epimonsterous:** ooh are we reviewing art?
&gt; **jorgumander:** not bad, but not good either
&gt; **Phenylalanine:** I kind of like it, but it feels like it needs a lot refinement.
&gt; **blusepth:** it needs to be in color, like psychodelic swirls and stuff
&gt; **Phenylalanine:** Hey Epimon, we&#39;re just taking a look at this new guy&#39;s stuff. 
&gt; **Epimonsterous:** Eh. The shapes are a little lopsided, and your shading needs work.
&gt; **CoolGuy95:** Is it really that bad? I mean, I know I&#39;m not great but.... D:
&gt; **blusepth:** keep practcing, its the only way to get better
&gt; **jorgumander:** ^
&gt; **jackomundo:** background landscape would help too.
&gt; **CoolGuy95:** thanks for the feedback guys
&gt; **Phenylalanine:** You take criticism pretty well, that&#39;s good.
&gt; **CoolGuy95:** thanks
&gt; **jorgumander:** so people, today I put together a quick tutorial for people new to post-phenom. just a simple animated picture.
&gt; **jorgumander:** http://i.imgur.com/xsnISqj.jpg
&gt; **blusepth:** lemme look
&gt; **jackomundo:** the writing is kind of sloppy.
&gt; **Phenylalanine:** I can barely read it, but I think I know the process you&#39;re describing. 
&gt; **Phenylalanine:** The one with the crystals and rat blood? 
&gt; **jackomundo:** yes
&gt; **Phenylalanine:** That&#39;s a good one, tried and true. Still, you really need to improve your handwriting. Maybe use the text tool in Photoshop instead.
&gt; **CoolGuy95:** it sounds interesting
&gt; **blusepth:** jacko&#39;s tutorial is pretty hard to read, but it is a good technique for you to try out CoolGuy.
&gt; **jorgumander:** yea, it is pretty simple and cheap. 
&gt; **CoolGuy95:** I think I will. I can read the tutorial well enough since my own handwriting is bad.
&gt; **Phenylalanine:** It would be good for you as an artist. It&#39;s always a good idea to experiment in new mediums. 
&gt; **CoolGuy95:** I&#39;ll get started right away. I can get a mouse from the pet store down the road.
&gt; **Phenylalanine:** One thing before you go CoolGuy.
&gt; **CoolGuy95:** ?
&gt; **Phenylalanine:** If you see the letters &#34;SCP&#34; in that order anywhere, on a truck, on a building, on someone&#39;s clothes, anywhere, drop what you are doing run.
&gt; **Phenylalanine:** Run like you have never run before.</textarea></pre>
