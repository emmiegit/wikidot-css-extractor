**Item #:** SCP-7032

**Object Class:** Keter, Thaumiel - Potential Apollyon

**Special Containment Procedures:** Scp-7000 is to be contained within a 20m x 20m x 20m room with a 360 degrees security camera. Electrical barriers are to be placed along each wall and line the exterior of the room. Barriers must be checked every 2-3 weeks for structural integrity. Should Scp-7032 attempt a breach, internal electrical shocks are to be activated at voltage level 10. If the electrical shocks have no effect all personnel are to terminate all D-Class and evacuate the site. In the event of a Code Crimson 7032 breach, personnel are to contact O5 council.

**Description:** Scp-7032 is a male humanoid entity with gold eyes and brown, gold flaked hair and a metallic crimson marking underneath his left eye. It is unknown how he has gotten his abilities, as he refuses to answer any question relating to his origins. However, due to security footage, it is believed he comes from another universe, or potentially another multiverse. His anomalous abilities include, but are not limited to, the ability to see a short amount of time into the future, the ability to &#34;glitch&#34; through time and/or space, and entering a pocket dimension.

   So far, Scp-7032 has proven to not only be friendly at most times, but also helpful. He has refused to re-enter his containment chamber until he has finished helping someone. He has also been reported to be able to change the outcome of most events so that they turn out in his favor. In a Scp-682 containment breach, he had been able to help recontain Scp-682, however, his method wasn&#39;t exactly favorable by the O5 council.

   However, he can be unfriendly as well. When cross-tested with 682, he had been enraged to the point where he breached containment and broke a researchers arm. Since the breach, he has been cold towards Foundation staff and other humanoid entities, with the exception of who he claims to be his sister.

   A possible connection between him and Scp-7026 has been brought up by the appearance of wolf-like features and behavior. He even claims to be a &#34;missing part of Scp-7026&#34;. Cross-testing has been reconsidered.

**Addendum: 7032.1** Associated Phenomena
&gt; **Date:01/12/2015**
&gt; **Location:Site-19**
&gt; █████: Unknown anomaly has been sighted just at the point of a newly formed crater. Witnesses went to investigate the area after multiple lightning bolts struck the same spot repeatedly. Send in a Retrieval team immediately.
&gt; ███████: Retrieval team has been dispatched to investigate.

&gt; **Date:01/12/2015**
&gt; **Location:█████, Nevada**
&gt; Retrieval 1: All bystanders have been cleared out and administered amnestics. Retrieval 2 and 3, investigate the crater. Retrieval 4 and I will ensure nobody comes by.
&gt; Retrieval 2: Copy that, we&#39;re going in to investigate.
&gt; //Retrieval 2 and 3 make their way down into the cater while 1 and 4 secure the perimeter.//
&gt; Retrieval 3: I got something over here, it  looks like an 8 year old boy, unconscious. It&#39;s most likely the anomaly, due to the glow from its eyes.
&gt; Retrieval 1:Then grab and return to the vehicle.
 **Addendum: 7032.2** Cross-Testing
&gt;Date: 2/12/2016
&gt; Dr.Sanders: Ok, Scp-7030, please approach Scp-682.
&gt; Scp-7032: Why the hell would I do that?!
&gt; Dr.Sanders: Do not question the instructions, please approach Scp-682.
&gt; Scp-7032: Fine, but if I get hurt I&#39;m making sure you feel the same amount of pain I do.
&gt; Dr.Sanders: Just get on with it already.
&gt; //As Scp-7032 approaches Scp-682, 682 looks towards 7032 with an exhausted expression.//
&gt; Scp-682: Another human, disgusting.
&gt; //At hearing this, Scp-7032&#39;s eyes start to dim, and turn into a crimson color.//
&gt; Scp-7032: I&#39;m sorry, but what did you say? Because last time I checked, I wasn&#39;t a mirror, shit-head.
&gt; //Scp-682 was momentairly stunned by the remark, as most humans usually are to afraid to talk like this to it. But as 682 was about to attack, Scp-7032&#39;s body started to harden into an unknown metal alloy. 682 tried to tear through the metal, but only resulted in it&#39;s claws being damaged.//
&gt; Scp-7032: The last entity to say something like that to me ended up in pieces. Now you will too.
&gt; //After saying this, Scp-7032 lunged at Scp-682 and started to flail it, destroying all of 682&#39;s body mass within 4 minutes. It was easy to say that 682 breached containment and killed the researchers that were involved, with the exception of Dr.Sanders. So did Scp-7032, though he did break Dr.Sanders right arm as a warning.//

Addendum: 7032.3 Mass Containment Breach
&gt; Date:1/1/2017
&gt; Scp-7032: I will get out, today. No matter what, I will escape.
&gt; after hearing a recording of this, more guards were stationed outside the containment unit. Lockdown was prepared to be active until Scp-7032 breached containment, smashing through the doors and tearing through the foundation staff&#39;s gear like paper. He punch one in the stomach while simultaneously knocking another onto the ground. Further details have been classified due to some workers now experiencing PTSD from the incident.
