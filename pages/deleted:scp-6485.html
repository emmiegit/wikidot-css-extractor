| caption=Figure 1.1 Photograph of SCP-6485, circa 1984.]]

**Item #:** SCP-6485

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Historical records have been altered to exclude SCP-6485. The general public currently believes that only two nuclear detonations took place in 1945. Any individual who says otherwise should be detained for investigation.

Outside of testing and routine monitoring environments, no individuals are permitted within the exclusion zone established around SCP-6485. Trespassing civilians are to be administered amnestics. Trespassing personnel are to be executed at the nearest opportunity.

An effort to reverse SCP-6485 is underway; until a feasible solution can be made, a team from the Department of Prescience is to monitor the situation.

**Description:** SCP-6485 is the third nuclear bomb and subsequent detonation that took place in ████████, Japan, 1945 as part of the US atomic bombings. The nuclear weapon was developed in unison with the other two bombs used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, under Operation Manhattan[[footnote]]A US program that saw the development of nuclear weapons during the Second World War.[[/footnote]].

The epicenter of the detonation and the surrounding 800km² area are disconnected from the primary timeline due to a complication within the Department of Prescience in 1995[[footnote]]The nature of this error remains unknown.[[/footnote]]. As a result, the initial blast and all objects that were initially in the surrounding area became temporally fixed in space time and are frozen in place.

**Addendum:** Photographic Work of SCP-6485

During an expedition in 1984, the Department of Prescience took photographs of the SCP-6485 exclusion zone for research purposes. The team was instructed not to touch any object or person to avoid further damaging the timeline. Although the actual photographs are restricted to senior Prescience staff, a summary of each has been appended below.

[[div style=&#34;background: gray; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;&#34;]]

[[div style=&#34;background: white; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px; font-family: &#39;Roboto&#39;, sans-serif; color: #000000&#34;]]

[[&gt;]]
Photograph #1
[[/&gt;]]

A marketplace in the outskirts of the exclusion zone. The detonation itself is not visible in the photograph, but its light can be seen emanating off-camera. A few people can be seen turning their heads towards the explosion, but most have not reacted yet. Notably, in the center of the image, is a woman dragging away a young child. The child is reaching for a toy which has fallen to the ground; the woman (presumably the mother) is in mid-conversation with an elder man. In her hands is a warning pamphlet similar to those dropped in Japan by US forces.

[[&gt;]]
Photograph #2
[[/&gt;]]

Photo taken of a poster on a factory wall, detailing a systematic evacuation plan. Two American planes (both B-29 Fortress bombers) are flying overhead in the distance - the photography expedition team reported another two B-29&#39;s not captured in the photo, along with air raid sirens which can&#39;t be heard due to the temporal nature of SCP-6485.

[[&gt;]]
Photograph #3
[[/&gt;]]

School playground. Students are lined in rows outside, with an adult in front of each single-file lane. A senior woman, possibly the Head of School, is walking down one of the lines with her finger pointed to one of the students. In the far left corner of the photograph, another man can be seen doing the same, presumably counting the number of children.

There is a large gate in the background. A crowd of young adults are huddled against the metal bars, shouting. One person has his arms out, ready to receive one of the children who has run away from the line formations. However, a teacher is dragging away the child as it cries.

The detonation is not visible.

[[&gt;]]
Photograph #4
[[/&gt;]]

Photograph taken in the streets, likely a town square, closer to the explosion. People can be seen rushing for shelter; some are holding their hats and others are carrying small children. A handful of soldiers are coordinating the general populace.

In a nearby restaurant, an elderly couple are still seated with their eyes closed and hands held tightly together.

[[&gt;]]
Photograph #5
[[/&gt;]]

Photograph of a residential zone close to the blast. Fiery orange has engulfed most of the city&#39;s infrastructure. Buildings are suspended in mid air, still in the process of crumbling. 

In the foreground of the image, a woman is squatting and hugging a dog tightly. The pair are just below a falling house, and are half disintegrated. Neither appear to be in pain but the woman&#39;s face - or what is left of it - is filled with fear.

It is likely that local civilians were unaware of a nuclear threat, and believed that the US Army Air Force (USAAF) were conducting another standard air raid. A request from one of the team members to extract and bury the woman and dog was denied.

[[&gt;]]
Photograph #6
[[/&gt;]]

Photograph appended above (Figure 1.1). Building is only two streets away from the epicenter. All form of human life has been lost. It is believed that all human activity in the building was vaporized nearly instantly. 

Further investigation indicates that the building was an astronomical observatory, or possibly some other research facility for space-related studies. This can not be confirmed, however, as nearly everything inside the building had already been disintegrated by the initial blast.

[[&gt;]]
Photograph #7
[[/&gt;]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;Photograph #7 [RESTRICTED TO 4/PRESCIENCE]&#34; hide=&#34;ACCESS GRANTED&#34;]]

Photograph taken of the blast itself from as close as possible. The blast is still miniature, and a mushroom cloud has not formed. 

From the center of the detonation, hints of the astral plane can be seen. When the image is observed under infrared light, tachyon threads which radiate from the middle are visibly torn. Several threads have disintegrated entirely, and others are barely intact. Occasionally, [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-stitch-in-time-saved-mine a tall, presumably male figure] can be seen reaching his arm out.

Behind him, various figures can be seen watching the city. Most are embracing one another or holding hands.

**Addendum:** Statement from Director Timothy E. Tailor


&gt; Welcome back, or maybe you aren&#39;t supposed to be here yet. Some of you are reading this before the document has even been made - that&#39;s normal.
&gt; 
&gt; In short: there was never supposed to be a third nuclear detonation.
&gt; 
&gt; The work we do here at the Department doesn&#39;t just determine the future. Our work is what holds a timeline as delicate as ours together. When you get sloppy - or too curious, in this case - this is the kind of thing that happens. We&#39;re here to fix things up, not make it worse.
&gt; 
&gt; So I need you to get up to speed //and fast//. We never have too many hands.
&gt; 
&gt; Don&#39;t fuck things up, or [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5746 I will have to deal with you too].
&gt;
