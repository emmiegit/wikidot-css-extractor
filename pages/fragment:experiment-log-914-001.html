**Test 11828-U5:** Tests on the nature and construction of SCP-914

With approval from O5 Command, a single gear was removed from one of the &#34;outer&#34; sections of SCP-914. Placement was carefully documented, and was in a location that would not release tension on any belts or damage any documented sections. Testing area was cleared and sealed after placing a steel block in the &#34;intake&#34; booth. D-00104 was dispatched to SCP-914, and instructed to turn the key and activate SCP-914.

D-00104 reported that &#34;the key won&#39;t catch&#34;, and the key was observed to turn several times without tightening the mainspring. No activity of any kind was observed from SCP-914 during this time.

Missing gear was replaced with an identical copy, comprised of the same metal (brass) as the original. Steel block re-inserted into the &#34;intake&#34; booth, and SCP-914 was activated on the &#34;1:1&#34; setting. SCP-914 observed to operate normally, with a slight pause of 3.5 seconds after winding the key. After &#34;refining&#34;, Output observed to be a solid steel sphere with the same volume as the original steel block. Original gear returned to SCP-914.

//Note: Well, thank god we can at least repair the damn thing if we damage it... assuming we can find what&#39;s broken in it. Hell, maybe it&#39;s already broken, I don&#39;t know... this damn thing hurts my head... - Dr. ██████████//

**Test 914-0101**
**Name:** Dr. Gears
**Date:** ██/██/20██
**Total Items:** Four clockwork pocket watch, belonging to Dr. Gears

**Input:** One gold-plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Small clockwork bird. When the tail is pressed, it produces a robin&#39;s call.

**Input:** One gold-plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Toy clockwork train engine.

**Input:** One gold-plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Miniature grandfather clock, fully functional.

**Input:** One gold-plated pocket watch
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Small metal sculpture of a piano.

//Note: It appears there is a high level of randomness when SCP-914 &#34;refines&#34; an item. However, it seems to preserve some elements of its original composition, in this example, clockworks. This is not a law, but a high probability. Refine a metal bar, and you&#39;re more likely to get a simple metal object than an internal combustion engine. Both, however, are possible. - Dr. Gears//

**Test 914-0102**
**Name:** Dr. Gears
**Date:** ██/██/████
**Total Items:** Three copies of all documentation, photographs, and test logs accumulated in relation to SCP-914.

**Input:** One copy of SCP-914 documentation
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** Folder containing all previously entered documents, arranged in chronological order.

**Input:** One copy of SCP-914 documentation
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Hard-bound book containing 400 pages. No diagrams, photos, or other visual aids of any kind are included. The pages appear to be solid black, but microscopic examination shows each page to be covered in approximately twenty thousand characters. The text has no correlation with any known writing style, and is not in a linear format, with &#34;sentences&#34; constructed from individual characters spread out between many pages. Each sentence requires an exceedingly complex formula to decode, with each formula unique to each sentence.

//Note: Current decoding work has resulted in two partially translated sentences after 225 work-hours. Item appears to be a record of the internal structure of SCP-914.//

**Input:** One copy of SCP-914 documentation
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** Single sheet of paper. Weight is exactly the same as the entered documentation. The sheet appears to be a single page from the entered SCP-914 documentation, however when flipped over to the right, the reverse side is the following page in sequence. When flipped over to the left, the opposite side is the preceding page in sequence. No new documentation is included, but this item is significantly easier to store, if more time-consuming to browse.

//Note: It&#39;s screwing with us, you know that right? I don&#39;t CARE if it&#39;s been proven that it has no self-awareness, this thing is LAUGHING at us! - General ████████//

//Note: There seems to be some difficulty as to the meaning of &#34;fine&#34; and &#34;coarse&#34; on the settings; the machine appears to be capable of refining input based either on a scale of complexity (loss of entropy accompanied by increase in connectivity between components and/or acquisition of subjective meaning) or of simplification (separation into composite materials and loss of meaning). - Dr. Gears//

**Input:** One cross
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** One fragment of wood of the same mass, cut flat on 3 sides. This may be a fragment of a larger cross.

**Input:** One cross
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One wooden crucifix with intricately detailed carving of Jesus Christ.

//Note: This may imply that [[[SCP-914]]] has an understanding of religion. More experiments with religious items are indicated. - Dr. Cenh//

//Note: This test may indicate that SCP-914 understands the use of input objects and not simply their function. Recommend testing with medicines reliant on the placebo effect to ascertain if outputs provide actual medicinal solutions to problems. - Dr. Pyrrhus//

**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A shareholder&#39;s note for &#34;Soap from Corpses Products&#34;, worth one hundred U.S. dollars. It is unknown whether 914 selected a Foundation&#39;s front out of pure whimsy, or because of some other criteria.

//Update: As in ██/██/████, Soap from Corpses Products&#39; shares skyrocketed, and the aforementioned &#39;Fine&#39; output is now worth $████ (USD). It is under investigation if 914 &#39;selected&#39; Soap from Corpses Products because it &#39;knew&#39; was going to rally, or if it was a matter of pure luck.//

**Test 914-0119**
**Name:** Dr. von Hildebrandt
**Date:** 26/03/2014
**Total Items:** One set photocopies and duplicates of lab notes and other research material on SCP-914.

**Input:** One set of research materials
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One leather-bound tome, 54cm x 42cm, 256 vellum pages, with title written in gold leaf. Language of the title and the contents were at first unidentifiable, and were later discovered to be an old dialect of Finnish. The contents are written in calligraphy, and more than half the pages are elaborately illuminated with colored inks and gold and silver leaf. Once translated, the contents proved to be identical to the contents of the input material, arranged chronologically. The tome has been radiocarbon dated to the early 11th century C.E.

Anachronistically, a leather pocket is sewn into the inside back cover, and this pocket contains what appears to be a modern compact disc, 10cm in diameter. Data on this disc is encoded by an unknown codec. Attempts to divine the codec and decipher the data are ongoing.

//Note: It&#39;s a pity the contents of this tome are classified. It&#39;s a piece worthy of any museum. I&#39;ve never seen such exquisite calligraphy. The illuminations may prove to be the most interesting part of the book, though. They often portray clockworks and related mechanical parts as well as some of the input or output objects; possibly they relate in a direct rather than abstract way to the operation of SCP-914 as described on the illuminated pages. - Dr. von Hildebrandt//

//Note 1: Dr. █████, a noted film enthusiast, entered a destructively excited emotional state upon learning of breadth of content, and, for project&#39;s protection, has been denied access to laboratory for study&#39;s duration. Requests for specific data from the object, however, are not to be rejected. No extraordinary data handling rules currently require enforcement, although this may change if Dr. █████&#39;s interest becomes a dangerous obsession. The object will be tested to discern if recreation of new medium falls within safe limits.//

**Input:** One DVD copy of 1999 motion picture &#34;The Matrix&#34;
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** One heavily-worn VHS home video of Japanese schoolchildren acting out 1999 motion picture &#34;The Matrix&#34; in backyard.

**Addendum:** One child has been successfully identified, with the others in progress. Approximately nine Foundation-tested anonymous packages are being designed, with fractal-remastered content to be included within.

//Note: One package air-mailed to address in Fukushima.//

**Input:** One &#39;Marshall&#39; brand speaker system.
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One &#39;Sony&#39; brand speaker system. Sound quality was identical between the two, despite the differing manufacturers and materials.

 **Input:** One &#39;Marshall&#39; brand speaker system.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One speaker system of unknown brand. When turned on and provided with music, sound produced was indistinguishable from the quality and timbre of a live performance by instrumentation.

**Input:** One &#39;Marshall&#39; brand speaker system.
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One black sphere, assumed to be a single continuous speaker. When approached by D-9566, object scanned his head, emitted a sharp electronic beep, and began to emit sound at around 150 decibels. Mild structural damage was done to the test chamber, and all personnel within 500 m of the chamber sustained hearing damage of varying degrees, from temporary damage to permanent loss. Activation event was ended when Agent Kane opened fire on the object with his sidearm. While these shots missed the object, they did impact with D-9566, killing him and ceasing the event.

//Note: I can&#39;t believe the last thing I ever heard was Barry Manilow. We couldn&#39;t have found a D-Class with better music taste? - Dr. Maguire//

**Total Items:** Three £10 notes. one will be used for each test. Each test will occur at 12:00pm GMT.

**Input:** One £10 note
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** HK$100

//Note: Hong Kong was previously British territory prior to 1997. It is unknown whether SCP-914 chose HKD by chance or if it chose this currency due to Hong Kong&#39;s prior association with Great Britain, although the fact that it chose to use a note from the pre-handover era lends to the latter theory. Also of note is that HK$100 was, at the time of the test, almost equal in value to the £10 used as an input.//

**Input:** One £10 note
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** Two £5 notes, both from the same year as the input.

**Test 914-0152**
**Name:** Dr. Geralds
**Date:** 03/06/2017
**Total Items:** Three lithium-ion batteries, manufactured by A123Systems

**Input:**  One  lithium-ion battery
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One lithium-ion battery, manufactured by the Chinese company Hunan Shanshan Toda Advanced Materials Co., Ltd.

**Input:**  One lithium-ion battery
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One object that resembles an unmarked lithium-ion battery. Closer inspection revealed that much of the internal mass of the battery had been converted into a radioactive isotope of [REDACTED], deriving power from its nuclear decay, with a design very similar to that used in many spacecraft. Object placed into storage.

**Input:**  One lithium-ion battery
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** When the output door opened, air rushed into the output chamber as if a vacuum had been present within. The object is a black cube with two electrical nodes on the top, 15 cm across, and weighing exactly the weight of the input battery plus the air in the chamber. The object is unmarked, with the exception of a small printing on one side, warning users that the object contained antimatter, and advising caution. Antimatter composition of object has not yet been confirmed, but has shown no limit to energy capacity. Object currently under testing.

//Note: I think we should refrain from putting anything with a lot of potential energy into SCP-914 in the future. If the pressure wave from the air had damaged the output, all of Site-██ could have been destroyed. Not a pleasant thought. - Dr. Geralds//

**Test 914-0154**
**Name:** Dr. Hadian
**Date:** 08/07/2017
**Total Items:** Three comforters, fitted for twin-size beds.

**Input:** One of the comforters
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A quilt of similar make and size.

**Input:** One of the comforters
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A hand-crafted blanket. The thread count is notably high and the surface has a sleek, silky feel, but the mass is unaltered.

**Input:** One of the comforters
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A comforter that has shown moderately anomalous properties. Testing with a few voluntary subjects shows that wrapping them up in the blanket, such that it covers around 80% of their body, results in a sense of security and well-being. Subjects wrapped in it and laid on their back report drowsiness and lose consciousness exactly 300 seconds later. The subject remains unconscious until the blanket is removed, at which point they awaken, reporting a restful sleep. Additionally, during this rest period, minor injuries and afflictions disappear, including scrapes, bruises, and in one case, a nasty cold.

//Note: Well, that&#39;s enough from me for tonight. Someone wake me at 8, will you? - Dr. Hadian//

**Test 914-0155**
**Name:** Dr. Collins
**Date:** 17/08/2017
**Total Items:** Five New generic brand skateboard wheels w/ bearings

**Input:** One green wheel
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** A few chunks of unformed green rubber and plastic, as well as a small pile of steel dust.

**Input:** One green wheel
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** Disassembled green skateboard wheel. Appears to have been used heavily and shows scuff marks and discoloration.

**Input:** One green wheel
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One red wheel of identical make and quality.

**Input:** One green wheel
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One unmarked black wheel of almost perfect quality. The outer rubber of the wheels greatly resists wear even with prolonged use, and the center bearing exhibits almost no friction, and was successfully left spinning in a vacuum sealed environment for just under ██ days.

**Input:** One green wheel
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One bearing, suspended by an invisible outer wheel of unknown material. Although invisible, the outer wheel physically exists and appears to use higher-dimensional translations to redirect the force of gravity and propel the object forward at at about half the speed of free fall. The wheel can be easily stopped at low speeds, but gains momentum quickly while unhindered. Prospective researchers should note that under the influence of gravity the wheel will always retain a 1/4mg horizontal force, even while at rest.

//Note: And they say you can&#39;t reinvent the wheel. - Dr. Collins//
**Addendum:** Following the collision of a Class-D personnel with Dr. ████ at ██ mph, all human testing has been suspended until Dr. ████ can come up with proper testing procedures.

**Test 914-0156**
**Name:** Dr. Hadiane
**Date:** 19/08/2017
**Total Items:** Three collections of children&#39;s toys made from magnets and ball bearings

**Input:** One magnet and bearing set
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A collection of interlocking plastic rods. The tips of each are magnetised.

**Input:** One magnet and bearing set
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A series of magnetic rods and metal balls that appear to be self-replicating and self-assembling. Current structure is a pyramid roughly half a meter wide and tall. This structure shows no other anomalous properties and has been safely contained.

**Input:** One magnet and bearing set
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A fine metal dust that exhibits similar properties to the &#34;Fine&#34; result, appearing to resolve itself into crystalline structure. It can be safely molded by hand, with the rough consistency of hot wax, and can be pulled apart without much effort. Class-D personnel who touched the substance barehanded reported a feeling of delight, and continued to play with it even as it encased their hands. Subjects were pulled away without injury and the substance has been contained.

//Note: Well, it certainly seems like a fun little toy to play with, but I&#39;m fairly certain this isn&#39;t safe by any metric. - Dr. Hadian//

**Date:** 21/08/2017
**Total Items:** Three Samsung Galaxy phones

**Input:** One Samsung Galaxy phone.
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One Apple iPhone.

**Input:** One Samsung Galaxy phone.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A cell phone of unknown make or model, still using the same Android Operating System as before. The device seems to have the capability to use cellular data even while out of range of any cell towers. More testing is required.

**Input:** One Samsung Galaxy phone.
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A black, malleable circular disk with a single button on the back. Pressing the button causes a hologram to begin projecting from a small LED-like device on the front. The hologram functions as an operating system for the device, which like the output produced by the Fine setting never loses cellular service. More testing is required.

//Note: I think we should reverse engineer the holographic phone produced by the Very Fine test, it could potentially be an amazing business opportunity if we can figure out how to reproduce it. - Dr. Ahearna//

**Test 914-0159**
**Name:** Dr. Mason
**Date:** 07/09/2017
**Total Items:** Five real-time location beacons, standard Foundation issue.
//Note: The area above and around SCP-914 was set with receivers before this test. In this test, all directional notation is relative to the central &#34;Intake&#34; and &#34;Output&#34; booths, i.e., a subject standing at the mainspring is facing &#34;North&#34;.//

**Input:** One tracking beacon
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** Small amounts of various scrap metals and other composite materials of tracking beacons.
**Path:** Within the first 0.15 seconds, the signal was traced to move 3.41 meters &#34;North&#34; before turning exactly 91 degrees. Signal was lost after another 0.3 meters.

**Input:** One tracking beacon
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** One tracking beacon, with battery and transceiver unit removed. No other visible damage.
**Path:** While again initially traveling &#34;North&#34; for 3.41 meters, the tracking device remained functional for almost twice the amount of time as the first trial. This path appeared to follow the outer edges of the rectangular main body of SCP 914 before the signal was lost.
//Note: I wonder if there are set paths that each setting follows. - Dr. Mason//

**Input:** One tracking beacon
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One unlabeled tracking beacon consistent with those used by Canadian counter-terrorist groups.
**Path:** &#34;North&#34; for 3.41 meters. Signal then moves towards one of the &#34;Southwestern&#34; outer segments of SCP-914, where it repeatedly follows an equilateral triangle for 0.13 seconds before losing signal. Analysis of received signals shows a new signal retracing a path back to the booths.
//Note: Seriously, though. What is that first bit Northward for? I&#39;ve checked the recordings, it does that in every test. Every. Single. One. - Dr. Mason//

**Input:** One tracking beacon
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One apparent tracking beacon,  components consistent with Foundation-specific requirements. Tracking beacon is smaller than standard, with certain unknown components. Testing revealed it to be fully operational, although signal was lost mid-test, as the output ran a different operating system.
**Path:** &#34;North&#34; for 3.63 meters. &#34;South-southeast&#34; for 0.7 meters. Accelerates in the opposite direction for four meters before signal cutoff.
//Note: So, I was talking to a colleague about my testing, and they said that the Fine output sounded familiar. Turns out the smaller beacon and the new OS are both prototypes right now. Guess we end up using them. - Dr. Mason//

**Input:** One tracking beacon
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One thin strip of translucent film, shown to be attachable with static cling. Discovered to be remarkable resilient for its size when D-1126 tore a fingernail pulling it off of the wall of the Output Booth. Currently unreadable.
**Path:** &#34;North&#34; for 3.41 meters. Subsequently appears to reach all parts of SCP-914, although high speeds prevented receivers from accurately tracking the path.
//Note 1: Well, that was disappointing. At least I got a strip of fancy tape. Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to get something out of the prior results. - Dr. Mason
Note 2: So, turns out if you let that tape stick itself to your hand, you can draw the paths of whatever it recorded. You also draw a legend, and what appears to be a menu screen. I&#39;m going to try to get this put onto a D-Class to preserve my wrists. - Dr. Mason
Note 3: Wow. So, not only did the new tracker record its own movements, it somehow recorded ALL of the movements. Of EVERYTHING that 914 has worked on over the last three months. I think I&#39;ve finally gotten 914 to work with us, albeit with a lot of analysis involved. This is amazing. - Dr. Mason
Note 4: [EXPLETIVE DELETED]. I thought it would make sense for ONCE. But no, it had to be messing with us again. One of my interns - sorry, Junior Researchers - found out that, if you superimpose all the paths from the tracker, you get a 3D image of the Foundation logo. It&#39;s pretty for art drawn in GPS, but it still makes this whole project meaningless. Piece of [EXPLETIVE DELETED] doesn&#39;t follow set paths. It does whatever it wants. - Dr. Mason
Note 5: Dr. Mason has been placed on psychological leave due to apparent stress. Junior Researcher Chen has taken over. Analysis of the object paths taken will continue. - O5 Command//

**Input:** One Disc
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One Apparently unchanged compact disc. However when played for D-class personnel, test subjects mentioned tasting maple syrup and bananas, additionally had a feeling of fullness afterwards. They declined offers of food for a period of 4 hours afterwards, and blood tests immediately after the experiment indicated the consumption of a high carbohydrate meal, even though no food had been consumed by the subjects for 6 hours previously. No other anomalous effects were reported.

**Input:** One Disc
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One apparently unchanged compact disc. However when played for D-class personnel, an immediate euphoric effect was noted, with certain individuals weeping with emotion and others falling over with apparent rictus smiles on their face. Soon after the effects were noted additional symptoms were exhibited, including seizures, jaundice, and vomiting. The experiment was immediately ended, however researcher A-1 ████ was injured by D-17645 while attempting to turn off the disc player, begging the researcher to allow him to continue listening to the music.

Security proceeded to restrain the remaining ambulatory D-class personnel long enough for ██████ to deactivate the player. Physical examinations and testing of the individuals exposed to the music revealed the presence of a previously unknown euphoric-inducing toxin in their bloodstreams. Chelation was performed, but one individual expired from a combination of kidney failure, liver failure, and cardiac necrosis.

//Note: Let’s try and avoid any more CDs that might be interpreted as &#34;dangerous&#34;. It might be a good idea to just get a Lawrence Welk single and see if people get drunk. - Dr. ██████//

**Date:** 17/02/2018
**Total Items:** One printed copy of a Javascript program (meant to be a &#34;chat bot&#34;)

**Input:** The aforementioned manuscript
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A small paper-mache head that spoke in a choppy, occasionally non-sequitur fashion. In spite of its ability to communicate, the head appears to lack true sentience, instead repeating back phrases taught to it and a few other basic English sentences.

//Note: About what I expected. I could be mistaken, but it would appear that even though SCP 914 is a mechanical device, machine code is still somehow understood by it. This would make sense, with the interpretation that it functions based on the &#34;meaning&#34; of objects, and given the explicit functionality of most programming languages, we might be able to achieve more stable results this way. - Dr. Hadian//

**Test 914-0179**
**Name:** Dr. Hadian
**Date:** 22/02/2018
**Total Items:** One manuscript of a simple Javascript program, one fluorescent light bulb.

//Note: The code in question was a program devised to have the bulb turn on if it was being held right-side up. This test is to see if SCP 914 will comply in fabricating such an object.//

**Input:** The aforementioned materials
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A luminescent mass, opaque, with a smoky white color. The object could be moved without difficulty, but it would not rotate in any fashion except in a way that kept it perpendicular to the floor. In all attempts to defy this property, it has proven immobile, causing the tester&#39;s hand to slip, defying gravity, and in one case, shattering the shaft of a power tool rigged to turn it over.

//Note: We&#39;ll chalk that one up as &#34;inconclusive&#34;. Certainly an interesting paperweight, though. -Dr. Hadian//

**Test 914-0182**
**Name:** Dr. Rook, Technician █████
**Date:** 10/03/2018
**Total Items:** One manuscript of a Javascript program (self-learning chatbot), one manuscript of a Javascript program (Convolutional Neural Network model), one mechanical pocket watch, one photo of a bird (Pica sericea).

//Note: The previous tests done with mechanical parts and code sections by Dr. Hadian and Researcher Mikk intrigued me. - Dr. Rook//

**Input:** One manuscript of a Javascript program (self-learning chatbot), one manuscript of a Javascript program (Convolutional Neural Network model), one mechanical aluminum &amp; silver pocket watch, one USB, one photo of a bird (Pica sericea).
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A mechanical bird roughly the size of a large pocket watch. Resembled a Korean Magpie in shape. The bird seemed to be made with a mix of clockwork and realistic metal plumage. By some unknown mechanism, it could hover for brief periods (roughly 45 seconds) in the air, though its base material- aluminum and silver- should’ve prohibited it from doing so. It could not speak in this form, though it displayed considerable intelligence and responded to people speaking to it. When connected to a computer via USB cable, the bird was able to speak through the computer’s speakers. It was capable of speech comparable to an eight-year-old child’s, though speech patterns significantly improved after several conversations. It acted remarkably similarly to a live magpie. Other than the mechanical bird, three folded sheets of blank paper were found in the output chamber. Close analysis revealed that they had no anomalous properties. Placed in item storage.

//Note: I’m keeping the bird for some more research into how 914 could be used to create automated objects. One of the first tests recorded included a clockwork bird, so that’s where this came from. Dr. Hadrian was right! Think of the possibilities! - Dr. Rook.//

//Note: No matter how much Dr. Rook&#39;s &#39;Robbie&#39; resembles a young child during communication, the result of this test has not yet been verified to be fully sentient.//

However this model is entirely anatomically correct to //Cygnus buccinator// in every way, with some organ systems being made of seemingly impossibly thin layers of paper. The model displays no anomalous properties.

//Note: Interesting. 914 created a model of my personal favorite species of swan from the original paper one. Sentience or coincidence? I need to do more tests, but first make sure that model is saved in Fragile Non-Anomalous Item Storage, it could be useful at a later date. - Dr. Joe//

**Test 914-0184**
**Name:** Dr. O’Bryan
**Date:** 25/03/2018
**Total Items:** Three different pieces of communication on paper medium.

**Input:** One typed thesis, titled “An Experimental Study on the Stress Limits of Metals in Corrosive Liquids”, as submitted by D-914-29.
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One typed thesis, titled “A Complete Experimental Study on the Stress Limits of Metals in Various Environments”.  A review of the output by the subject and subsequently studied by appropriate personnel revealed no anomalous properties.  The output contains research on several experiments not included in the original input, with suggestions on how to vastly improve the strength of metals in a wide variety of situations.  A review of the output is being conducted by the Facilities and Engineering Department to test to see if these findings can improve security within the Foundation.

**Input:** One page of sheet music from “Ellen’s Third Song” by Schubert, as submitted by D-914-86.
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** Tiny (5cm x 5cm x 2cm) origami music box.  Upon opening the box, a clear melody identified as the song “Ellen’s Third Song” could be heard by all researchers in the area facility, including those who should be well out of range of being able to hear.  Subject D-914-86 began singing along with the music, despite not showing any previous indication of knowing either Latin or taking singing lessons.  After the conclusion of the piece, subsequent experiments confirmed that she could not sing.

**Input:** One copy of “How to Win Friends and Influence People” by Dale Carnegie, as submitted by D-914-77.
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One slightly warmer copy of “How to Win Friends and Influence People”.  D-914-77 was sent back to their cell and monitored, showing no anomalous behavior after a week of review.

//Note: D-914-77, and two guards have been reported as missing.  Security footage shows the guards opening several doors and escorting D-914-77 off the premises, and driving them to a nearby restaurant.  When a security team was sent there to retrieve the subject, a conflict began between the patrons of the restaurant and the security team, with the patrons refusing to allow the security team close to D-914-77.  An order was given with O4 clearance to destroy the location, as a possible memetic anomaly may have occurred.  Although the remains of D-914-77 have not been positively identified, security footage suggests that no one escaped the building prior to its demolition.  Local media have been alerted to the fact that the destruction was caused by a broken gas main in the restaurant&#39;s kitchen.//

//Note: A full memetic screening will be made whenever media provided by SCP-914 is consumed.  Please refer to Incident Report 914-IR6187 for further details.//

**Output:** 500mL of orange liquid with the viscosity of water. Extremely greasy to the touch, became sticky when dried. Smelled mildly of peanuts.

**Input:** 500mL sample of SCP-999
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A frozen block of SCP-999 slime. Attempting to melt back to liquid form resulted in a pile of orange sludge much thicker and more adhesive than before. Further heating resulted in discovering its napalm-like qualities.

**Input:** 500mL sample of SCP-999
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A small, spherical blob of translucent, azure-colored slime roughly 12cm in diameter, with a strong garlic-like odor. Found to be mobile and sentient, and capable of making gurgling, chirping vocalizations similar to SCP-999 but at a much deeper pitch. The entity, designated &#34;E-999-A&#34;, was immediately hostile to all staff, attempting to either leap upon researchers&#39; faces or &#34;headbutt&#34; their shins via rolling across the floor at high speed, though its small size and mass prevented it from doing more than mild bruising.

**Addendum:** E-999-A was eventually contained and presented to SCP-999, with the assumption that this was its &#34;offspring&#34;, and that SCP-999 could teach it to become more docile. SCP-999 instead reacted with immediate hostility, attacking E-999-A with its pseudopods while E-999-A rolled around SCP-999, emitting loud &#34;growling&#34; and &#34;snarling&#34; noises while dodging. SCP-999 finally eliminated E-999-A roughly two minutes later via engulfing it with two pseudopods, rapidly dissolving E-999-A inside its body similar to how SCP-999 digests its meals.

No change in SCP-999&#39;s color or demeanor following the incident has been noted, however, it is the first and thus far only time that SCP-999 has ever reacted to anything with hostility or violence. Mentioning E-999-A to SCP-999 results in it immediately &#34;ignoring&#34; whoever speaks to it, often by wandering off to play with a nearby object or person. Further research involving SCP-999&#39;s slime is temporarily suspended save for researchers with at least Level 3 clearance, and any experiments involving SCP-999 and SCP-914 are completely prohibited.

//Note: Prof. Snider is currently facing disciplinary action due to violation of biological safety protocol. The next one I catch is losing their clearance indefinitely. - Dr. Veritas//
