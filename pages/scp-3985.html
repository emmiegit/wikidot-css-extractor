**Item #:** SCP-3985
 
**Object Class:** Euclid
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** Site-262 is to be constructed for containment of SCP-3985. All non-aerial avenues of ingress are to be obstructed or destroyed following site construction. All records containing the exact location of Site-262 are to be removed from Foundation systems, and all vehicles transporting personnel or resources to Site-262 are to have tracking systems disengaged prior to departure. Site-262 is to operate permanently at alert level 9.[[footnote]]Alert level 9 requires the immediate termination of trespassing individuals regardless of awareness or apparent affiliation.[[/footnote]] 
 
A sensory deprivation chamber is to be maintained within Site-262 for the continuous containment of SCP-3985 via immobilization harness. The harness is to be fitted with feeds for intravenous drug administration, nutrition provision, and waste disposal. A record is to be maintained of all changes in the appearance of SCP-3985 and all vocalizations made by SCP-3985 over the course of containment.
 
Protocol COMMANDMENT NOON is to be executed in the event that SCP-3985 vocalizes more frequently than a total of ten minutes per 24 hour period or refers to itself in the first person while vocalizing. The Overseer Council is to be immediately notified through secure communication channels if protocol COMMANDMENT NOON results fall below key thresholds listed in associated documentation.
 
**Description:** [DATA EXPUNGED]
 
**Addendum 3985-A (Notable Static Features of SCP-3985):**
* Cellulose mass integrated into intestinal tract. Origin and function unknown.
* Functional nictitating membrane in both ocular systems.
* Apparently vestigial fifth heart chamber.
* Microfractures throughout the skeletal structure. Likely a result of physical violence.
* Large accumulations of scar tissues across torso and limbs. Likely a result of physical violence.
* Absence of smallest two fingers on left hand. Damage likely inflicted by human teeth.

**Addendum 3985-B (Protocol COMMANDMENT NOON):**
[[collapsible show=&#34;[OPEN ADDENDUM]&#34; hide=&#34;[CLOSE ADDENDUM]&#34;]]
**Protocol Overview:**
&gt; Protocol COMMANDMENT NOON was designed primarily to maintain SCP-3985&#39;s null-personality state in an efficient and reliable manner. It was secondarily designed to not rely on traditional amnestics following the resistances developed by SCP-3985 in the course of previous containment procedures. The procedure entails a significant amount of psychic distress for the subject as a result of alternative amnestic techniques. This is considered to be an acceptable consequence given the state of the subject following successful completion of the procedure. 
 
**Procedure Sequence:** 
&gt; Exact details held at Site-262. 
 
**Result Measurements:**
&gt; Exact details held at Site-262.

**Partial Communication Record (May 18, 2066):**
[[collapsible show=&#34;[OPEN RECORD]&#34; hide=&#34;[CLOSE RECORD]&#34;]]
**TO:** Overseer Council
**FROM:** Board of the Ethics Committee
**SUBJECT:** Official Complaint Regarding the Obfuscation of SCP-3985
&gt; For consideration by the Overseer Council, 
&gt; [[&lt;]]
&gt; The Ethics Committee has always recognized the fact that some information will not be made available for review. Exceptions to our mandate have been permitted in the effort to contain information that is innately hazardous, contagious, or otherwise detrimental to humanity at large. This ceding of authority in the field of containment procedures has only ever been taken with care and consideration, and the significance of it should not be understated.
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of SCP-3985, no opportunity has been provided for the Ethics Committee to consider the implications of voluntary disengagement from standard procedures. Critical portions of SCP-3985 documentation have yet to be made available despite repeated requests, a state of affairs in direct violation of Foundation tradition and bylaw. This situation must not be allowed to continue for the sake of healthy internal relations and continued ethical operation of the Foundation.
&gt; 
&gt; As a result, the following steps must be taken:
&gt; * The full body of SCP-3985 documentation must be provided to the Ethics Committee. All records involving Protocol COMMANDMENT NOON must be further provided.
&gt; * Access to Site-262 must be made immediately available for Ethics Committee inspectors. 
&gt; * A review of all currently contained anomalies must be conducted to determine if similar lapses of reporting have taken place.
&gt; * All responsible individuals must be censured to the fullest possible extent under current guidelines.
&gt; 
&gt; Failure to carry out these actions will severely impair the ability of the Ethics Committee to ensure that all Foundation activity is compliant with its moral standards. It will further impair our ability to engage constructively with members of the Overseer Council in any future matters.

**TO:** Chairwoman Elif Sakarya
**FROM:** Overseer-3
**SUBJECT:** Re: Official Complaint Regarding the Obfuscation of SCP-3985
&gt; Chairwoman Sakarya,
&gt; 
&gt; The Ethics Committee&#39;s request was reviewed by today&#39;s partial meeting of the Overseer Council. It was determined following careful consideration that we will not comment in any capacity on actions undertaken in pursuance of 4 FUL § 110. Any inconvenience suffered by the Ethics Committee is regrettable, but this course of action is necessary in accordance with the broader needs of the Foundation. 
&gt; 
&gt; The Overseer Council is confident that the Ethics Committee in particular will understand that what is necessary is often unpleasant, and we have faith that you will bear this dutifully along with your other crosses.
&gt; 
&gt; Further information requests should be made through standard channels.

**TO:** Overseer Council
**FROM:** Board of the Ethics Committee
**SUBJECT:** Official Complaint Regarding Overseer Council Behavior
&gt; For consideration by the Overseer Council, 
&gt; [[&lt;]]
&gt; The necessity of firm leadership over the Foundation&#39;s trilateral mission has never been in question. Recent actions by members of the Overseer Council have given the Board of the Ethics Committee reason to wonder if the current leaders of the Foundation have passed beyond the point of firmness and taken it upon themselves to rule rather than direct. In the long term, a pattern of such behavior would be certain to lower the standing of the Council and decrease the efficiency of all functions it oversees. A comprehensive record will be provided to validate this assertion.
&gt; 
&gt; Given this behavior, the Board of the Ethics Committee recommends that the following steps be taken to reestablish the standing of the Overseer Council and ensure that no further undesirable actions are taken by its members:
&gt; * Membership of the Overseer Council should be expanded to include a broader range of experiences and viewpoints. At least 13 additional members should be appointed on a provisional basis as soon as is possible under standard procedures.
&gt; * At least one member of this expanded body should be an active member of the Ethics Committee.
&gt; * A broader effort should be made to describe the activities of the Overseer Council and the rationale supporting them.
&gt; 
&gt; Only by ensuring that the Overseer Council does not cement itself as a group of tyrants can the longevity and productivity of the Foundation as a whole be maintained. It is the hope of the Board of the Ethics Committee that individuals on the Council will be able to acknowledge this truth, and will place our collective mission above their personal interests.

&gt; The Overseer Council is disinterested in discussing this topic. We are similarly disinterested in your attempts to force our hand to action. There is more important work to be done. Tend to your own garden, as you have in the past, and we will tend to ours.
&gt;

**FORESIGHT-21 Predictive Analysis Memo 1625 (May 21, 2066):**
[[collapsible show=&#34;[OPEN DOCUMENT]&#34; hide=&#34;[CLOSE DOCUMENT]&#34;]]
**TO:** MTF Alpha-1 OPCOM, Overseer Council
**FROM:** FORESIGHT-21 Advanced Threat Analysis Division
**SUBJECT:** Internal Security/Ethics Committee: Possible Imminent Action Against O5 Assets
&gt; FORESIGHT-21 has been tasked by MTF Alpha-1 OPCOM to examine recent Ethics Committee activity in light of communication that took place on May 18th between O5-3 and the sitting Chairwoman of the Ethics Committee.
&gt; 
&gt; We assess with a high degree of confidence, based on a large body of SIGINT and IMINT, that Ethics Committee leadership will mobilize MTF Zeta-1[[footnote]]Supplementary force assigned directly to Ethics Committee during the 2031 Facade Slip.[[/footnote]] to carry out hostile action against the Overseer Council within 72 hours. We further assess with a moderate degree of confidence that this action will precede wider action across Foundation elements dissatisfied with current leadership or desiring significant policy change.
&gt; 
&gt; Frequency and magnitude of electronic communication between Ethics Committee Chairwoman Sakarya and Zeta-1 OPCOM have surpassed previously observed peaks since the date of the incident in question. Sakarya&#39;s psychological profile indicates an inclination to unilateral action in response to apparent persecution, as well as strong convictions regarding the institutional norms of the Ethics Committee. The loyalties of Zeta-1 leadership have been notably aligned toward her person in recent years. Sakarya has proven willing to escalate departmental conflict to achieve short-term objectives during reconciliation negotiations[[footnote]]See HINDSIGHT-20 Report on 2064 Budgetary Crisis and related damages.[[/footnote]] and likely remains confident that tensions can be managed once she has secured an advantageous position.
&gt; 
&gt; Increased activity by Zeta-1 component teams has been noted in Site-06, Site-17, and Site-88 despite the lack of an immediate threat to those sites. Multiple component teams have failed to file scheduled field reports, and tracking signals appear to be undergoing ongoing disruption. All active elements of Zeta-1 possess considerable aptitude in a variety of conventional policing and military operations.
&gt; 
&gt; Full report has been attached.

**Proposed Revisions to SCP-3985 Documentation:**

[[&lt;]]
The following text has been proposed to replace the expunged description of SCP-3985:
&gt; SCP-3985 is the collective designation of fourteen humanoids who vary in terms of age, sex, and ethnicity. Additional information on SCP-3985 is available in Site-262 archives.

**Partial Communication Record (August 19, 2072):**
[[collapsible show=&#34;[OPEN RECORD]&#34; hide=&#34;[CLOSE RECORD]&#34;]]
**TO:** Overseer Council
**FROM:** Board of the Ethics Committee
**SUBJECT:** Official Request for Inspection of Site-262
&gt; For the attention of the Overseer Council,
&gt; [[&lt;]]
&gt; The Board of the Ethics Committee has been made aware that critical information is absent from the documentation of SCP-3985 and that no inspectors have had the opportunity to examine regulation compliance at Site-262. We are confident this is an oversight given our shared eagerness to certify all Foundation sites as operating ethically.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, the 2071 Review of Contained Anomalies cannot be completed without direct examination of all humanoid containment practices. As such, we must request permission for Ethics Committee inspectors to access all related documentation and facilities. We assure you that this review will be conducted with the utmost speed and discretion so as to not disrupt the important work of Foundation personnel.
