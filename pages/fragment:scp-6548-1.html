**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-6548 is to be secured in High-Risk Object Storage Vault 18 at Site-78. Only personnel with Level 4/4000 clearance or above are allowed to handle SCP-6548. At least 8 armed guards must be stationed at the entrance of SCP-6548’s storage vault at all times. SCP-6548 is to be monitored by security cameras, motion sensors, radiation detectors, and Kant counters at all times.

Access to SCP-6548 is prohibited under any circumstances, except with direct approval of the O5 council. Any unauthorized personnel who attempt to access SCP-6548 and its related information are terminated upon discovery. All testing involving SCP-6548 is prohibited until further notice.

Foundation agents are to recover any information regarding SCP-6548-A instances.

 _

**Description:**

SCP-6548 is a cuff bracelet made of 99.999% pure gold. SCP-6548 is 7.2 cm in diameter, 3 mm thick, 5 cm wide, and has a 2.5 cm opening. SCP-6548 has shown to be invulnerable towards any form of damage, including anomalous influence.

A bas relief cartouche is sculpted on the outer surface of SCP-6548, which is empty if SCP-6548 is not worn by a humanoid subject. If SCP-6548 is worn by a humanoid subject, engraved hieroglyphs will appear within the cartouche. The hieroglyphs are always the most accurate translation or phonetic representation of the subject’s original name. The cartouche will return to an empty state once SCP-6548 is removed from the subject.

While a humanoid subject is wearing SCP-6548, the subject gains a temporary anomalous ability to verbally issue exactly one instruction to a second subject, which must be executed by the second subject as long as it is logically possible or within the second subject’s capabilities. The subject wearing SCP-6548 will gain linguopathic[[footnote]]The anomalous ability to read, write and speak any language fluently with no prior knowledge.[[/footnote]] abilities and the same form of invulnerability as SCP-6548 during the process of issuing the instruction. The process above must fulfil the conditions below:

# The subject wearing SCP-6548 must be able to communicate verbally
# The subject wearing SCP-6548 must be able to directly point at the second subject using the appendage which SCP-6548 is worn on
# The subject wearing SCP-6548 must reference the second subject by their original name
# The subject wearing SCP-6548 is allowed to describe the instruction to a degree necessary for its execution
# The subject wearing SCP-6548 is not allowed to instruct the second subject to follow more instructions from them in the future
# The second subject must be sentient
# The second subject must be able to perceive verbal instructions

A subject who successfully issued an instruction through SCP-6548 is categorized as SCP-6548-A. SCP-6548-A will immediately demanifest, leaving SCP-6548 behind. All efforts to locate SCP-6548-A after demanifestation have thus far failed. All existing information and memories regarding SCP-6548-A’s original name, aliases, physical appearance, past activities, and personal history will be corrupted by a Class-V antimemetic hazard, rendering them incomprehensible. Subjects who had a close personal relationship with SCP-6548-A display a form of natural resistance towards the antimemetic hazard, retaining limited memories on generic physical traits and significant events involving SCP-6548-A. However, in all cases, the antimemetic corruption on SCP-6548-A’s original name is unpreventable and irreversible.

Based on current documentations, subjects wearing SCP-6548 have successfully issued instructions to normal humans, anomalous entities, Class-V reality benders, and Class-VII ontokinetic entities. So far, no subject is able to disrupt, reject or misperform the instructions issued through SCP-6548.

Research results on using SCP-6548’s properties for Foundation personnel to achieve temporary invulnerability were inconclusive, as all documented SCP-6548-A instances issued a valid instruction within 2 minutes. Whether this is caused by a memetic influence is unknown. Although there are various proposals to explore the possibility of SCP-6548 application in containing other anomalies, the ability of SCP-6548 to grant its wearer absolute authority over another subject is too dangerous and unstable for practical use.

 _

**Discovery:**

SCP-6548 was first discovered on 28/12/2021 by a group of archaeologists in a previously uncharted tomb 180 km away from Amarna. The unusual topography and previously unseen method of concealment render it almost impossible for one to discover the tomb without guidance.

The group was led by Professor Aaron Duncan, who has several ancient Egyptian grimoires and a map to the tomb in his possession. He claimed to have purchased the map from a black paramarket in Cairo, Egypt. He suspected that his group was trailed by the Culture Cleansing Centre[[footnote]]Group of Interest which aims to thoroughly eliminate all cultures they deem to be inferior to the mainstream cultures in Malaysia through anomalous means. [[/footnote]] and reached out to the Foundation for help, but his claims remained unproved so far. The Foundation took Professor Duncan into custody for further investigation and gained control of the archaeological site.

The tomb in question was dated back to the First Intermediate Period (2181 – 2055 BC) of Ancient Egypt. Despite its evasive location and minimalistic external structures, the interiors of the tomb were full of intricate decorations and expensive offerings similar to those found in the tomb of a Pharaoh. Reliefs and documents found in the tomb detailed the extreme grief and regret of the people after the tomb owner’s passing, but they contain no information on the tomb owner’s identity. 

A plain sarcophagus was discovered in the centre chamber of the room, with SCP-6548 as its sole content. An empty cartouche and a short passage written in hieroglyphs were carved on the sarcophagus. An English translation of the passage is available below:

**Date:** 05/10/2022
**Timestamp:** 11:08:00 – 11:09:20

**Involved Personnel:**
Officer Hanli Su (Security Officer of Site-78)
Officer Jason Burg (Security Officer of Site-78)
Agent Cole Marcus (Member of MTF Omega-45 “Street Samurai”)
Agent Rinah Blunt (Member of MTF Omega-45 “Street Samurai”)
D-3349
D-4190
D-//[UNKNOWN]//

**Foreword:**
The following video file was retrieved from Site-78 database during the follow-up investigation of Incident 08 (See Addendum 05). The investigation was conducted to recover any comprehensible information regarding D-//[UNKNOWN]//.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

(D-3349, D-4190 and D-//[UNKNOWN]// enter the camera view in a queue, with Officer Su and Officer Burg as escorts)

**D-3349:** Um, where are we –

**Officer Burg:** Quiet.

(Distant roar of SCP-//[NUMBER: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]// is heard)

(D-3349 and D-4190 stop in their tracks, with D-//[UNKNOWN]// following suit)

(D-3349 and D-4190 start to look around anxiously, while D-//[UNKNOWN]// remains still)

**D-3349:** Wait, I know I signed the papers, but –

**Officer Burg:** (Nudges D-3349 with the hilt of his gun) Shut up and move.

(D-3349 and D-4190 gaze at each other helplessly, then at D-//[UNKNOWN]//)

(D-//[UNKNOWN]// ignores D-3349 and D-4190, then turns to face Officer Su with a //[FACE: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]// expression)

(Officer Su coldly stares back at D-//[UNKNOWN]//)

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** (Looks away and mumbles quietly) Right on time.

**Officer Su:** What?

**Officer Burg:** We’re late. Johnston’s waiting. (Gestures at D-3349, D-4190 and D-//[UNKNOWN]//) Get moving, all of you!

(D-//[UNKNOWN]// shrugs and continue walking, with D-3349 and D-4190 reluctantly follow suit)

(Officer Su and Officer Burg resume escort formation)

(Two sets of footsteps are heard from a distance, followed by chattering)

(Agent Marcus and Agent Blunt enter the camera view from the opposite direction as the escort team)

**Agent Marcus:** Well, that was spicy for a newbie like you.

**Agent Blunt:** (Huffs) Just because I’m new to the Sams doesn’t mean I’m new to the job. (Smirks) Trust me, you’ll get to see more of it.

**Agent Marcus:** (Wraps both arms around himself and pretends to be afraid) Ah shit, now I’m worried. Cass is definitely kicking me out.

**Agent Blunt:** Well, good luck on that, smartass. At least I’m not that kind of person who did that stupid prank to Cass last –

(Agent Blunt stops abruptly as D-//[UNKNOWN]// walks past and turns to face her, presumably to establish eye contact)

**Agent Marcus:** (Groans and facepalms) Fuck! Who told you that? Johnston? Michaela? Oh, come on! You’re not a real Sam until your first Gauss rifle joke!

(Agent Blunt’s facial expression shifts between horror, anger, and disbelief, maintaining eye contact with D-//[UNKNOWN]// until D-//[UNKNOWN]// turns away and moved out of the camera view with the rest of the escort team)

**Agent Marcus:** Um, Rinah? Something wrong?

(Agent Blunt continues to stare at the direction which D-//[UNKNOWN]// left)

**Agent Marcus:** Rinah? Rinah! (Claps twice) You there? (Waves hands in front of Agent Blunt’s face) Hello ~~

(Agent Blunt is startled by Agent Marcus’ gestures, but regains composure soon after)

**Agent Blunt:** Oh! Yeah, I’m here, I’m here. (Rubs both eyes) I was thinking about someone… Something. Sorry. (Incoherent grumbling)

**Agent Marcus:** (Narrows eyes) I don’t know, man, could be the blasts messing with my eyes, but… You look kinda pale.

**Agent Blunt:** (Waves right hand in dismissal) No, I’m good.

**Agent Marcus:** You sure?

**Agent Blunt:** (Scoffs) Good enough to shove your rifle up your ass. I –

(A series of bleeping sound is heard)

(Both Agent Marcus and Agent Blunt reached for their Foundation-issued telecommunication unit to read an incoming message, their facial expressions turn grim immediately after)

**Agent Marcus:** Shit, I guess it’s no lunch Monday again. We gotta move.

(Agent Blunt nods at Agent Marcus, and both start running)

(Agent Blunt briefly turned around and looked up at the security camera before exiting the camera view with Agent Marcus)

**Addendum 02: Agent Rinah Blunt Helmet Camera Video Log 189**

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Video Filename:** MTF-OMEGA-45-6_HELMCAM_07-10-2021.mp4
**Date:** 07/10/2022
**Timestamp:** 22:30:02 – 22:33:58

**Involved Personnel:**
Agent Rinah Blunt (Member of MTF Omega-45 “Street Samurai”)
D-//[UNKNOWN]//

**Foreword:**
The following video file was recovered from the storage device of Agent Rinah Blunt’s Foundation-issued helmet camera during the follow-up investigation of Incident 08. The original video file was sabotaged by D-//[UNKNOWN]// through an unidentified anomalous digital device.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

(The video footage shows vertical viewpoint fluctuations while moving through unoccupied corridors, identified as Agent Blunt fast-walking towards the staff pantry in Site-78 east wing)

(After a final left turn, the staff pantry enters the camera view, followed by D-//[UNKNOWN]// leaning against the pantry’s entrance)

(The camera movement comes to a sudden halt, and Agent Blunt’s rough breathing is heard)

(D-//[UNKNOWN]// waves at Agent Blunt)

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** Hey. Glad you still remember our code.

(Agent Blunt remains silent and still for 5 seconds, looking at D-//[UNKNOWN]//’s direction)

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** Is something wrong?

**Agent Blunt:** …“Is something wrong”? You showed up in that fucking orange jumpsuit two days ago, and I thought maybe, just maybe – the HR fucked up, but now you show up here like it’s fucking natural? Everything is wrong, //[UNKNOWN]//, everything is so fucking wrong!

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** Shh, you need to be quiet, Rinah. Someone might hear us.

**Agent Blunt:** Oh really? I don’t even know why the fuck am I here. How did you even get here? They’re supposed to lock you up in the barracks! Why isn’t anyone here already?

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** I messed with the cameras, including the one they force you to wear. (Sigh) It’s just some tech that they don’t understand. Yet. Now calm down, will you?

(Agent Blunt remains silent for 10 seconds, the video footage shows slight trembling)

**Agent Blunt:** Just… How?

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** I always have my ways, Rinah. You know I do.

**Agent Blunt:** (Laughs in anger) Of course you do, //[UNKNOWN]//, like how you killed //[PERSON: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]//. You always get what you want, and you always get away with it. Well, I’m all yours now, then! What do you want from me?

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** (Sighs and rubs forehead) Listen, Rinah, I know you’re still mad at me, but look… It got you where you are, didn’t it? //[PERSON: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]// was nothing, no one liked him, and he’s just a stupid wall between you and your dreams. You don’t have to like what I did, Rinah, but it all turned out good, right?

**Agent Blunt:** Just because you’re my //[DESCRIPTION: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]// doesn’t mean you get to fuck with my life! You think you know everything about me? You think you really know what’s good for me, or it’s just another of your smart ass “deductions”?

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** Of course I know everything about you, Rinah. Since //[EVENT: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]//. All I want is the best for you.

**Agent Blunt:** (Video footage shows increased trembling) No you don’t. All you want is to lord over me. You can stew in your own lies, but I’m not buying it.

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** …Really? That’s all you think of me?

**Agent Blunt:** You’re damn right, //[UNKNOWN]//. You want to know what I think you are? (Points a trembling finger at D-//[UNKNOWN]//) You’re a bloody psychopath.

(D-//[UNKNOWN]// remains silent for 5 seconds, appears to be deep in thought)

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** No, I’m not. That would imply I care about nothing. (Slowly walks towards Agent Blunt) But I care about you, Rinah. That’s gonna count, right?

**Agent Blunt:** (Slowly backs off) Stay. Away. From me. I don’t know how or when, but we’re both getting into trouble because of this. I said I’m done with you, and I never want to see you again, but you’re here anyway. (Bitter laugh) But who am I lying to? Since when did I get to live my life without you?

(Both D-//[UNKNOWN]// and Agent Blunt remain silent for 30 seconds)

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** I… (Sighs) Alright, I have to admit, Rinah, I was wrong. I should’ve left //[PERSON: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]// alone. But you were so…excited, Rinah. And so disappointed when those bastards slapped you down just because they could.

**Agent Blunt:** (Laughs in anger) Nice try, //[UNKNOWN]//. Who knows? Might have worked if //[PERSON: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]// was the only person you fucked with.

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** …Is it too late for me to say I’m sorry?

**Agent Blunt:** (Scoffs) As if you are capable of feeling sorry.

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** (Slowly approaches Agent Blunt) Listen, Rinah. I’m sorry. I promise I won’t //[DESCRIPTION: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]// anymore, alright? Just… (Attempts to hug Agent Blunt)

(Agent Blunt pushes D-//[UNKNOWN]// away)

**Agent Blunt:** Don’t. I don’t know how you get here, and why you choose to be a D-class out of all the fucking staff you could impersonate, just… Please don’t hurt my friends. The Samurai… I really wish I could stay with them, but I’ll leave if you want me to.

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** Please, just trust me, I… It’s just that it’s easier to get around their screening as a D-class. You know, me being an actual criminal by now. (Silent for 5 seconds) I’ll leave you alone. I won’t mess around again, I promise.

**Agent Blunt:** I wish I could trust you, //[UNKNOWN]//, but sorry, I just can’t. Not anymore. I don’t know what you want, but you’re always gonna get it, aren’t you? No matter the fucking price.

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** I used to think the same, Rinah, but not anymore. Whatever I did that made you look at me like this… It’s a price that I’m not willing to pay.

(Both Agent Blunt and D-//[UNKNOWN]// remain silent for 10 seconds)

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** Rinah, I… (Sighs) I know you won’t believe it, but… I’m here just because I want to see you again. (Puts both hands in the air) Yeah, I know, you’re very uncomfortable right now. I’ll go. Just, one last question…

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** Do you still… think about me? Sometimes?

**Agent Blunt:** (Bitter laughter) We both know the answer, don’t we?

(Agent Blunt turns around until D-//[UNKNOWN]// is no longer within camera view, then fast-walks towards the opposite direction of the staff pantry)

**Addendum 03: Operation SYURGA Mission Debrief Document**

Last Updated On: 28/10/2022 (Archived)

This document was intended to convey prerequisite information to Foundation personnel assigned to Operation SYURGA, specifically all members of MTF Omega-45 (“Street Samurai”). Any unauthorized viewing and distribution of this document result in immediate disciplinary action.

**Background**
[[/size]]

On 30/09/2022, **The Auspicious Melur Queen**[[footnote]]Alias used for nomenclative protection.[[/footnote]], city council member of [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/esterberg-city-wikipedia FP-120] (“Esterberg”) and leader of a proto-Dayak Fae (//Homo sapiens sidhe//) tribe, reached out to the Foundation for assistance in containing //[ENTITY: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]//, a Class-V ontokinetic nomenclative hazard entity actively threatening her culture.

Based on incident reports provided by **The Auspicious Melur Queen** and supplementary historical documents provided by Site-612[[footnote]]Foundation site in Malaysia.[[/footnote]], it is confirmed that the influence of //[ENTITY: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]// will expand to other human cultures after the proto-Dayak Fae tribe is obliterated. Current evidence of this phenomenon includes the gradual, involuntary deemphasis of human Dayak culture and its traditional practices within Malaysia, which is slowly affecting the Minangkabau culture as well.

Although there is no solid evidence on the origin of //[ENTITY: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]//, **The Auspicious Melur Queen**, Dr. Tyler Guo (Level 4 Researcher, Staff of Site-612 Humanoid Anomaly Research Team) and Dr. Sabrina Redwood (Level 3 Researcher, Leader of Site-612 Thaumaturgical Anomaly Research Team) theorize that the entity is the physical embodiment of ideologies, opinions, and emotions listed below:

# Rejection towards aboriginal cultures in Malaysia
# Frustration towards uncommon nomenclatures used by unfamiliar cultures
# Sense of superiority against animism and anomalous religious entities
# Species supremacist ideologies among both humans and Faes with Malaysian cultural origins
# Denial on the importance of dead or aboriginal cultures in Malaysia both in the past and present

Recently, the activities of the Culture Cleansing Centre have significantly increased. Based on existing evidences, this is due to the establishment of a coherent cult movement under their wing, which practiced //[ENTITY: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]//’s ideologies. As of date, //[ORGANIZATION: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]// activities have caused approximately 1,350 Fae casualties and 200 human casualties. Due to the nomenclative hazardous properties of //[ENTITY: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]//, it is impossible to account for every single casualty, making //[ENTITY: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]// far more dangerous.

As the progressive generalization of //[ENTITY: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]//’s ideologies is ongoing, which in the end will inevitably include all other dead or aboriginal cultures in both human and Fae history, the O5 council agreed to assist **The Auspicious Melur Queen** in containing – or if possible – neutralizing //[ENTITY: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]//.

**“Although the influence of //[ENTITY: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]// and its capabilities expand at a relatively low rate compared to other hostile anomalous cults, it is for our best interests that we eliminate this threat right now. Especially when it is capable of wiping out names of not just individuals, but entire cultures. As mediocre or dead as some might think, these cultures are still part of our history. Localized or not, we are not letting a CK-Class scenario happen again on our watch.” – O5-4**

[[size 120%]]
**Rationale of Appointment**
[[/size]]

Based on the intelligence provided by **The Auspicious Melur Queen**, an anonymous entity with precognitive ability, and the local reconnaissance team of Site-612, the //[ORGANIZATION: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]// cult movement headquarters is protected by antimemetic nomenclative-based thaumaturgy closely related to Malaysian culture. Sightings of ferrous ectoplasmic entities were confirmed, ruling out the possibility of assistance from Fae personnel.

The influence of //[ENTITY: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]// is minimal on personnel who lack emotional, ancestral and social connection with aboriginal cultures in Malaysia. However, it is crucial for personnel to possess an adequate amount of knowledge and empathy towards the victims of //[ENTITY: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]// to avoid contributing to the generalization of //[ENTITY: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]]//’s effects. Advanced scenario simulation and thaumaturgical analysis indicate that weapons derived from [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6952 SCP-6952] are effective against ferrous ectoplasmic entities.

Based on the criteria above, MTF Omega-45 (“Street Samurai”) is selected for Operation SYURGA. As usual, Researcher Maria Johnston is responsible for mission coordination and supervision of MTF Omega-45.

[[size 120%]]
**Mission Outline**
[[/size]]

**Date:** 01/11/2022

**Time:** 02:00 (GMT +8)

**Location:** //[ORGANIZATION: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]// cult movement headquarters on Gaya Island, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia

**Identified Hostilities:**
100 – 150 human cult members
10 – 15 Fae cult members
50 – 60 ferrous ectoplasmic entities

**Involved Personnel:**
MTF Omega-45
Researcher Maria Johnston (Handler)

**Additional Resources:**
3 D-class personnel (To be assigned)

**Procedure:**

The operation squad of Operation SYURGA consists of MTF Omega-45 and 3 assigned D-class personnel. The D-class personnel are trained to carry out Procedure //[RITUAL: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]//, which is theoretically capable of containing or neutralizing //[ENTITY: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]//. MTF Omega-45 must escort the D-class personnel to the cult movement headquarters and protect them at all costs until the procedure is completed. Any feasible disciplinary action is allowed to ensure the cooperation of D-class personnel.

To avoid detection, the operation squad is to be deployed 8 km away from the north side of the cult movement headquarters via water transport and approach the target area on foot. MTF Omega-45 is to maintain radio communication with Researcher Johnston at all times. Standard night-time infiltration protocol is to be followed. MTF Omega-45 is free to engage any cult members and ferrous ectoplasmic entities to ensure that the following mission targets are achieved, except in self-defense:

# Obtain information on the real designation of //[ENTITY: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]//
# Recover information on unaccounted //[ENTITY: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]// victims, if possible
# Force //[ENTITY: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]// to manifest via Procedure //[RITUAL: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]//

**Involved Personnel:**
Researcher Maria Johnston (Handler)
Agent John Cassington (Ω-45-1)
Agent Cole Marcus (Ω-45-2)
Agent Peter Rickards (Ω-45-3)
[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7261 SCP-7261]-1, a.k.a Michaela Avalerra (Ω-45-4)

D-//[UNKNOWN]//

**Foreword:**

The following video file was recovered from the storage device of Agent Rinah Blunt’s Foundation-issued helmet camera during the follow-up investigation of Operation SYURGA. The original video file was heavily corrupted by the anomalous influence of //[ENTITY: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]//. The technical team of Site-78 successfully recovered a 10 minute 30 second fragment.

During Operation SYURGA, D-3349, D-4190 and D-//[UNKNOWN]// were assigned to MTF Omega-45 to carry out Procedure //[RITUAL: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]//.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

[During Operation SYURGA, Researcher Johnston remained in the temporary safehouse established on Gaya Island, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia to remotely monitor MTF Omega-45 and maintain radio communication]

(Loud explosion is heard, dust and debris obstruct the camera view despite Ω-45-6 jumping into the nearest building on time)

(Ω-45-6 coughs heavily)

**Ω-45-6:** Shit! Rickards! Thalaestris! Where are the Ds?

(Only radio static is heard)

(Distant screaming of D-4190 is heard)

**Ω-45-6:** Fuck!

(Ω-45-6 gets up from the floor and runs outside, extremely uneven breathing and footsteps indicate some degree of injury)

**Ω-45-1:** Rinah!

(Ω-45-6 turns her head to the left abruptly, revealing Ω-45-1 running towards Ω-45-6 after terminating 2 ferrous ectoplasmic entities)

(Ω-45-6 begins to lose consciousness, as the camera view becomes extremely unstable and closer to the ground)

(Ω-45-1’s arm reaches out to hold Ω-45-6 before she topples to the ground)

**Ω-45-1:** Hey – hey! Stay with me, Samurai! Stay with me!

**Ω-45-6:** Urgh…

(Ω-45-1 helps Ω-45-6 to sit down and lean against a lamppost, before attempting to radio Researcher Johnston)

**Ω-45-1:** Johnston! This is Cassington! We are under heavy fire! It’s a trap! A mole in Site-612 set us up! I only have Rinah with me right now, I’m not sure what happened to the others… Johnston! Do you read me?

**Researcher Johnston:** (Static disruption) Cass…Don’t…The //[RITUAL: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]//… Back… (Static disruption)

**Ω-45-1:** Damn it!

**Ω-45-2:** Chief! Rinah! Thank god – Ah fuck!

(Ω-45-6 regains consciousness and slowly looks up, revealing Ω-45-2 struggling to avoid several spectral appendages made of glowing proto-Malay glyphs while trying to run towards Ω-45-1)

**Ω-45-1:** Marcus! (Fires Gauss rifle at the spectral appendages) Hurry! Get her inside!

(The spectral appendages slightly retreat after being shot, vocalizing a series of low hums in an unidentified language)

(Ω-45-2 managed to escape the spectral appendages and starts moving Ω-45-6 into a half-destroyed hut, while Ω-45-1 continues to shoot the spectral appendages and approaching entities)

**Ω-45-2:** (Weak laugh) So much for your first big mission, huh? How are we gonna get more new recruits if all our jobs end up – Ah!

(Ω-45-6 is dropped to the ground as an entity grabs onto Ω-45-2 and starts enveloping itself around him)

**Ω-45-6:** M… Marcus…

(Ω-45-6 forces herself back up and rushes towards the entity)

**Ω-45-6:** Let him go –

(Ω-45-6 draws her tactical knife and separated Ω-45-2 from the entity by severing its hand)

**Ω-45-6:** You ugly –

(Ω-45-6 retrieves a grenade, pulls off the safety pin, then stuffs the grenade into the mouth of the entity)

**Ω-45-6:** Piece of shit!

(Ω-45-6 kicks the entity out of the building, and the grenade explodes immediately after)

(Camera view is obstructed by dust and smoke, only the coughing and groans of Ω-45-2 and Ω-45-6 are heard)

**Ω-45-2:** Well, that was… //radical//. Thanks.

**Ω-45-6:** (Whines in pain) I’m gonna find that mole and give them the same VIP treatment.

(Ω-45-2 helps Ω-45-6 up, as Ω-45-1 retreats into the hut with them)

**Ω-45-1:** Argh, there’s too many of them! I heard something blow up, are you alright?

**Ω-45-2:** Well, as okay as we can be in this shithole. Any word from Johnston?

**Ω-45-1:** (Sighs) Nothing. The comm is full of noise. Could be the cultists.

(A distant bird cry is heard, followed by a visibly injured eagle struggling to fly into the hut)

(Ω-45-6 reaches out her arms and catches the eagle before it falls to the ground)

**Ω-45-6:** Michaela! Marcus, her legs, hurry!

(Ω-45-2 retrieves Ω-45-4’s legs from a harness on his back and gives them to her)

(The eagle slowly transforms into Ω-45-4, who starts coughing vigorously)

**Ω-45-4:** I… (Coughs) I found Rickards… He’s buried under a house the cultists blew up… (Coughs) Fuck, this place, those things… Smell so foul…

(Ω-45-2 runs towards Ω-45-6 and Ω-45-4 with first-aid tools in hand)

**Ω-45-2:** Hang in there, Michaela! I’ll –

**Ω-45-4:** No, no, I’m fine… (Coughs) I’ll be fine in a while. Give it to her. She’s got it worse. (Looks up at Ω-45-6 weakly) How are still standing, to be honest?

**Ω-45-6:** I dunno, desire to not die in this shithole?

(Both Ω-45-4 and Ω-45-6 laugh weakly, as Ω-45-2 tends to Ω-45-6’s wounds and Ω-45-1 guards the entrance)

**Ω-45-4:** It makes me happy, you know? (Coughs) Tough ones like you make me feel less…different. And thanks for catching me… Rinah.

**Ω-45-6:** You’re welcome, Michaela.

(Screaming of D-3349 is heard from a distance)

**Ω-45-2:** Great.

**Ω-45-1:** We’re running out of time, Samurai. We need to find the others and get a signal out before that thing kills us and everyone else. (Reloads Gauss rifle) Those scientists better have a backup plan. Avalerra, lead the way!

(Ω-45-4 gives Ω-45-6 a slight nod and detaches from her legs, which are retrieved by Ω-45-2 and secured on his back)

(Ω-45-6 gently throws Ω-45-4 into the sky, allowing the latter to smoothly transform into an eagle and take flight)

(Ω-45-1, Ω-45-2, and Ω-45-6 proceeds to follow Ω-45-4, shooting down several cultists and entities in the process)

(Ω-45-1, Ω-45-2, Ω-45-4, and Ω-45-6 arrive at the destroyed house where Ω-45-3 is trapped underneath, only to discover that D-//[UNKNOWN]// is already there and trying to help Ω-45-3)

**Ω-45-1:** Rickards!

**Ω-45-3:** (Groans weakly) Chief…

**Ω-45-1:** Rinah, go help that D-class! Avalerra, see if you can find Thalaestris! Marcus, with me! We need to hold these things back before Rickards is out!

**Ω-45-2, Ω-45-4, Ω-45-6:** Roger that.

(Ω-45-2 reloads his Gauss rifle and runs towards Ω-45-1, exiting camera view)

(Ω-45-4 flies off, exiting camera view)

(Ω-45-6 kneels down beside the rubble with D-//[UNKNOWN]//, who is already digging through the rubble rigorously)

(D-//[UNKNOWN]// briefly looks up to establish eye contact with Ω-45-6, which the latter does not avoid)

(After a few seconds of silence, D-//[UNKNOWN]// and Ω-45-6 resume digging)

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** I got him! Hurry!

(Ω-45-6 looks to the left to see Ω-45-3’s right hand emerging from where D-//[UNKNOWN]// is digging)

(Ω-45-6 immediately joined D-//[UNKNOWN]// in digging the same spot, the duo successfully freeing the upper half of Ω-45-3’s body in a short time)

**Ω-45-3:** (Coughs) S – sorry, guys, I messed up… The ritual… (Coughs) it didn’t work… I must have –

**Ω-45-6:** Shh, don’t talk, Rickards! Don’t waste your energy! It’s not your fault, (Sighs) it’s a mole. They must have messed with the ritual –

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** Watch out!

(D-//[UNKNOWN]// suddenly lunges at Ω-45-6, pushing both of them out of the reach of a giant spectral appendage)

(Both D-//[UNKNOWN]// and Ω-45-6 tumble into a half-collapsed building)

(A series of low hums in an unidentified language is heard from a distance)

**Ω-45-6:** (Coughs) //[UNKNOWN]//! //[UNKNOWN]//! Are you okay?

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** I’m fine! I’m fine!

(D-//[UNKNOWN]// emerges from the cloud of dust caused by their fall and runs towards Ω-45-6, offering her a hand)

(After a brief moment of hesitation, Ω-45-6 holds onto D-//[UNKNOWN]//’s hand)

(D-//[UNKNOWN]// helps Ω-45-6 up onto her feet)

**Ω-45-6:** Wait. What’s on your wrist –

(A series of loud rumbling and humming is heard, followed by glowing proto-Malay glyphs manifesting and floating around the area)

 (D-//[UNKNOWN]// and Ω-45-6 turn around, only for the both of them to directly face //[ENTITY: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]//)

**//[ENTITY: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]//:** (Speaks an unidentified language at louder and louder volumes)

**Ω-45-2:** (Distant) Fuck!

**Ω-45-5:** (Distant swearing in Greek)

**Ω-45-1:** (Distant) Avalerra, get Rickards! We need to get the hell out of here! Fuck, where’s Rinah?

**//[ENTITY: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]//:** [COGNITOHAZARD REDACTED]

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** Let me guess – No contingency plan?

**Ω-45-6:** (Bitter chuckle) There’s no way to get it anyway. Nothing fucks you up better than an inside job.

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** You know what? This is beautiful, actually.

**Ω-45-6:** …What?

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** No, I don’t mean that ugly bitch. I mean this predicament. It’s the perfect chance for me.

(A metallic clicking sound is heard and Ω-45-6 looks to the left, only to find her right hand cuffed to an exposed metal pipe from the wall next to her)

(Ω-45-6 looks down at her belt to find her Foundation-issued handcuffs missing, presumably stolen by D-//[UNKNOWN]//)

**Ω-45-6:** //[UNKNOWN]//?!

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** To make up to you and set things right.

**Ω-45-6:** Fuck! //[UNKNOWN]//! What are you doing? Let go of me!

(D-//[UNKNOWN]// rolls up her right sleeve to reveal SCP-6548, turning around to look at Ω-45-6 one last time)

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** //[STATEMENT: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]//

(D-//[UNKNOWN]// turns back to face //[ENTITY: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]// and walk towards the entity)

**Ω-45-6:** //[UNKNOWN]//! No!

(Ω-45-6 struggles to free herself, but to no avail)

**Ω-45-6:** Argh – fuck!

(Ω-45-6 reaches for her Gauss rifle and attempts to fire it at the handcuffs, but a mechanical arm reaches into camera view and stops her)

**Ω-45-5:** Don’t be stupid! You’ll blow your arm off!

(Ω-45-5 extends her arm-mount blade and uses it to severe the handcuffs)

**Ω-45-6:** Stop her! Goddamn it!

(Ω-45-6 attempts to run towards D-//[UNKNOWN]//, only to be blocked by multiple ferrous ectoplasmic entities)

(Ω-45-6 opens fire at the entities, with Ω-45-5 following suit)

(A series of Gauss rifle firing sounds are heard from a distance, as the entities are completely obliterated)

(Ω-45-1, Ω-45-2, Ω-45-3, and Ω-45-4 enter camera view and gather around Ω-45-6)

**Ω-45-1:** Thalaestris! Rinah! Report!

**Ω-45-3:** Wait, isn’t that –

(Ω-45-6 turns to look at D-//[UNKNOWN]//’s direction, only to see her raise her right hand and point the index finger directly at //[ENTITY: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]//)

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** //[DESIGNATION: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]//!

(//[ENTITY: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]// suddenly stops moving, all its spectral appendages start to vibrate and produce a sound similar to gasping and screeching)

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** (Loud declaration in an unidentified language)

(The physical form of //[ENTITY: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]// starts to rapidly expand and contract at random intervals, the entity’s vocalizations increase in volume and pitch)

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** (Loud declaration in an unidentified language)

(//[ENTITY: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]// slowly moves away from D-//[UNKNOWN]//, but appears to be struggling to do so)

(All the ferrous ectoplasmic entities within the camera view begin to move away from D-//[UNKNOWN]// as well)

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** (Loud declaration in an unidentified language)

**//[ENTITY: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]//:** (Screams in an unidentified language with multiple voices)

**D-//[UNKNOWN]//:** //[STATEMENT: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]//

**Ω-45-6:** NO!

([COGNITOHAZARD REDACTED])

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:**

Despite the unforeseen events and side effects, Operation SYURGA is considered successful as //[ENTITY: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]// was neutralized. MTF Omega-5 recovered SCP-6548 from the target area, but D-//[UNKNOWN]// cannot be found. D-//[UNKNOWN]// is reclassified as an SCP-6548-A instance.

After Incident 08, a thorough inspection of High-Risk Object Storage Vault 18 in Site-78 revealed that SCP-6548 was replaced by a 99.7% identical replica since //[DATE: ANTIMEMETIC CORRUPTION]//, but the exact time and method of replacement is unknown. 

The internal security breach of Site-612, D-//[UNKNOWN]//’s unauthorized possession of SCP-6548 and true relationship with Agent Blunt are under investigation. Site-78 and Site-612 initiated a joint operation to recover any information regarding D-//[UNKNOWN]// from all personnel from both sites.

**Addendum 05: Agent Rinah Blunt Interview Log**

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Interviewed:** Agent Rinah Blunt (Ω-45-6)
**Interviewer:** Dr. Aisya Mahmud (Chief Psychologist of Site-612)

**Foreword:**
The following interview was conducted on 02/11/2022 as part of the follow-up investigation of Operation SYURGA.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Dr. Mahmud:** Good morning, Agent Blunt. How are you feeling?

**Agent Blunt:** Like shit. (Silent for 5 seconds) Sorry, Dr. Mahmud, I didn’t mean to – 

**Dr. Mahmud:** No worries, Agent Blunt. Your reaction is completely understandable… Considering what you went through. (Sighs) I actually requested for a one-week recovery period for you and the rest of Omega-45, but the higher-ups want fast answers. (Silent for 5 seconds) I’m sorry for your loss, Agent Blunt.

**Agent Blunt:** (Buries face in both hands) Thanks, doc, but here’s the thing… I didn’t know what I’ve lost. Fuck, this is the worst thing I’ve ever felt in my life. I feel so sad for something… Someone… I can’t eat, I can’t sleep, I can’t think, but when I try to get to the bottom of it… It’s just an empty hole. 

**Dr. Mahmud:** (Scribbles down notes) I cannot imagine how you feel, Agent Blunt. But that’s the horror of SCP-6548… (Silent for 3 seconds) The closer you are to her, the more you get to remember – but never enough.

**Agent Blunt:** (Looks up) They all forgot about her, didn’t they?

(Silence for 5 seconds)

**Dr. Mahmud:** Unfortunately, yes.

**Agent Blunt:** Even the files about her are broken?

**Dr. Mahmud:** Kind of, yes. The files themselves are not broken, but the information about her is, well, rewritten in a way that’s beyond our comprehension.

(Silence for 10 seconds)

**Agent Blunt:** (Sighs) That’s why the higher-ups want you to talk to me, eh? To see if I can read them?

**Dr. Mahmud:** One of the reasons, yes. Another reason is, well, there are some folks out there who are truly grateful for what she did, and they wish to do something for her.

**Agent Blunt:** Can they bring her back?

**Dr. Mahmud:** I’m afraid they can’t, Agent Blunt. They say they want to remember everything that’s left of her, because that’s the only thing they could do for her. (Silence for 5 seconds) From my point of view, it’s not that different from normal mourning. For those who aren’t coming back… All we can do is remember.

**Agent Blunt:** Thanks, doc, I get it. But you’re gonna be disappointed… There’s really not much that I can remember about her.

**Dr. Mahmud:** Trust me, I won’t be disappointed at all. I’m all ears.

(Silence for 5 seconds)

**Agent Blunt:** Well, obviously, she’s a she. She’s… more or less the same size and height as me, her hair is long and brown… And… (Rubs temples) She smiles a lot. To me.

**Dr. Mahmud:** (Scribbles down notes) That info is more valuable than you imagined, Agent Blunt. Do you remember anything else?

**Agent Blunt:** We were close, very close… But I don’t remember how. She… (Silent for 5 seconds) Did horrible things for me. I can’t remember what, but the feeling still sticks in my stomach. Oh, and… (Slightly winces in pain) She came into Site-78 as a D-class, I don’t know how or why, but she did it. And that fucking gold bracelet… She had it… I don’t know since when, but she used it…

(A tear rolled down Agent Blunt’s right cheek)

**Agent Blunt:** She used it.

(Silence for 10 seconds)

**Agent Blunt:** (Buries face in both hands) I’m… I’m sorry, doc, I can’t… I can’t think about her anymore… The more I do, the hole gets bigger… I don’t wanna fall into it…

**Dr. Mahmud:** (Scribbles down notes) It’s alright, Agent Blunt. You don’t have to push yourself.

**Agent Blunt:** (Slightly winces in pain) …She saved me, but I can’t remember it.

**Dr. Mahmud:** (Gently pats Agent Blunt on the shoulder) It’s alright, Agent Blunt. Just breath, take a deep breath… Yes, just relax and breathe. It’s not your fault, Agent Blunt. You and your comraded did everything you could, I’m sure of it.

**Agent Blunt:** (In weak voice) Thanks, doc.

**Dr. Mahmud:** Thank you for talking to me, Agent Blunt. I assure you that it’s enough for quite a while. Please have a good rest.

**Agent Blunt:** (Weak smile) No problem, doc. To be honest, I gotta thank you too.

**Dr. Mahmud:** Hmm?

**Agent Blunt:** Thanks for reminding me that I can still do something for her.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:**
After the interview, a selected portion of antimeme-affected documentations from Operation SYURGA, Site-78 and Site-612 were delivered to Agent Blunt for possible clarification of their content. Agent Blunt was able to clarify 12% of the affected content, but none of them provided valid insight on D-//[UNKNOWN]//’s identity.

**Addendum 06: Site-78 Incident 2119**

On 02/11/2022, Agent Rinah Blunt (Ω-45-6) was absent from the scheduled second interview with Dr. Aisyah Mahmud (Site-612 chief psychologist). Based on witness accounts and security camera feed, Agent Blunt was last seen in her personal quarters in Site-78, but she was no longer present when other members of MTF Omega-45 investigated the place. All follow-up efforts to locate Agent Blunt have thus far failed.

Below are notable items discovered in Agent Blunt’s personal quarters shortly after her disappearance:

# A helmet equipped with security camera, which is part of the advanced tactical gear issued by MTF Omega-45 (Worn by Agent Blunt during her period of duty at Site-78, the rest of her gear cannot be found)
# A smartphone, heavily damaged by blunt force and water (Other Site-78 personnel confirmed that Agent Blunt never used this device in public)
# A printed copy of SCP-6548’s basic information
# Four empty cardboard boxes with their PVC sticker labels ripped off, each containing DNA traces of red fox (//Vulpes vulpes//), lion (//Panthera leo//), baleen whale (//Mysticeti//) and American crow (//Corvus brachyrhynchos//) respectively

As of 04/11/2022, Agent Blunt is officially considered missing.

**Addendum 07: Letter from //The Auspicious Melur Queen//**

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

Dear O5 council members of the SCP Foundation,

On behalf of the Esterberg city council and the Chengal-Swasta tribe, I express our uttermost gratitude to you for your assistance in eliminating the //evil god which no longer has a name//. The city council and the tribe are eternally grateful for your contributions in culture preservation and peacekeeping.

We were heartbroken by the news of your loss – our loss – of a hero brave enough to sacrifice her name for love. I am certain that you are no stranger to the great importance of names to both our culture and our very existence. We cannot bear to even imagine the suffering of our hero and those who are forced to face her loss on a personal level. Her sacrifice is more important to us than anyone else can ever comprehend.

To honour our nameless hero, the Chengal-Swasta tribe has decided to erect a statue at Bird-Raindrop Street, the centre of our population in Esterberg. The statue will be completed by 11/11/2022. We welcome all your members and those close to our hero to join the opening ceremony. As a symbol of peace and cooperation between Esterberg and the SCP Foundation, I humbly suggest that the Foundation honour her in equivalent ways.

On the other hand, the city council trusts you in safekeeping the artifact known to you as SCP-6548, especially from the hands of the Culture Cleansing Centre, but we must warn you that the artifact must not be used by anyone ever again. It belongs to the gods, and it is not meant for any of us to transgress. We shall look for ways to return it to its rightful realm so that the tragedy of our hero will not be repeated.

Once again, thank you for your assistance. We hope to hear from you soon.

Yours sincerely,
**The Auspicious Melur Queen**

------------

**Designation:** O5-4
**Suggestion:** Award the nameless D-class with a post-mortem Foundation star
**Additional Information:** Diplomatic opportunity – Invite **The Auspicious Melur Queen** and possibly other council members of of Esterberg
**Status:** Pending

**Addendum 08: Site-78 Incident 2198 Video Log**

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Incident #:** 2198
**Site #:** 78
**Video Filename:** A_PIECE_OF_MY_MIND.mp4
**Timestamp:** 00:00:00 – 00:45:00

**Involved Item:** [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/taboo [REDACTED PER PROTOCOL 4000-ESHU]]

**Involved Personnel:**
Agent Rinah Blunt (Ω-45-6)

**Involved Native Entities:**
&lt; The one with six pointy ears &gt;
~ The friend with amethyst eyes ~
{ The wine-brewer }
/ The bouncy dancer with blue fur /

**Foreword:**
On 24/12/2022, Researcher Johnston (Lead researcher of MTF Omega-45) and all active members of MTF Omega-45 received an email from an anonymous sender. All attempts to trace the sender have thus far failed. The email has no content, except with this video as its attachment. Based on their behaviours and expressions, it is assumed that none of the subjects who appeared in the video were aware of the video recording device.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

(The video starts, revealing a small clearing within //the forest which must not be referenced directly// which is surrounded by flourishing fruit trees and flowers)

**Agent Blunt:** (Distant) Right! I think this is a good place. Let’s just sit down and get some business done, shall we?

**&lt; Ah, yes! How lovely! Are you absolutely it’s your first time coming here? It almost feels like you’re one of us! (Giggles) &gt;**

**{ Stop being rude. It’s just that our memories on everything are fading. }**

(Agent Blunt enters camera view with a rolled-up straw mat slouched over her back, followed by **&lt; the devious gardener &gt;** and **{ the one who smells like yeast }**)

(Agent Blunt lays out the straw mat at the centre of the grass field and sits on it, waving at **&lt; the one who smirks too often &gt;** and **{ the one who is tired of all antiques }**)

(The two local entities hurry over and sit down beside Agent Blunt)

**Agent Blunt:** Alright, here are my tokens of sincerity. (Retrieves several packets of cookies and rice cakes from backpack, lays them out on the mat)

**&lt; Oh! Thank you! Thank you! (Immediately picks up a packet of rice cake) I can’t remember anything like it, but I can already smell its lovely aroma through the dinosaur-oil wrapping. (Rips open the packaging and starts munching happily) Umph, teischti! &gt;**

**{ These are glorious gifts indeed, my friend… (Picks up a packet of chocolate cookies and inspects it) But what favour from us is worth all these? I can tell from the look in your eye that you are fully aware of the stories of this place, correct? How are we supposed to be useful to you? }**

**Agent Blunt:** Actually… (Sighs) I’m not entirely sure. To be honest, I’m just trying my luck at this point. I’m looking for someone… Someone who also lost her name. I was… I was hoping that I can find her here.

(**&lt; The gluttonous one &gt;** stops chewing and looks at Agent Rinah in surprise)

(**{ The dedicated drink artist }** stops fondling with the packet of cookies and looks at Agent Rinah solemnly)

(Silence for 10 seconds)

**&lt; Oh my. So that’s the reason you’re dripping with sorrow… I’m so sorry, my friend, I take back all my foolish jokes and trickeries. &gt;**

**{ (Scoffs) Wish you could have done the same for me. (Moves closer to Agent Blunt) About your lost acquaintance, my friend… I’m afraid she won’t be here. There are terrifyingly many ways to lose your name, but hers is different from ours. }**

**Agent Blunt:** I see. (Looks up to the sky bitterly) Anyway, thanks for telling me.

(Silence for 30 seconds)

**&lt; If you don’t mind me asking, little one… (Puts down the rice cracker) How did you lose her? &gt;**

**Agent Blunt:** There’s this…artifact. Lets you give up your name to lord over others for once. 

(Silence for 5 seconds)

**Agent Blunt:** (Bitter laugh) She tried to be a hero, even though she lived most of her life as a psycho. She saved a lot of people – possibly everyone, to be honest – but ultimately, she did it just to save me.

(Silence for 30 seconds)

**{ (Looks up to the sky as well) If those who knew me back then are to grieve me, they must be having that look on your face as well. (Huffs and pats Agent Blunt on the shoulder) Well, there is no need to drown alone in sorrow. (Reaches into coat and retrieves nine glass bottles full of colourful liquid, presumably alcoholic beverages) Let’s do it together, shall we? &gt;**

**Agent Blunt:** Sure, why not? (Straightens back and does some light stretching) If it’s not going away anytime soon, some hangover might do the trick.

(Agent Blunt and the two local entities each grab a bottle of beverage)

(**&lt; The one with glamorous horns &gt;** flicks its fingers once, and the bottle caps fly off)

(Agent Blunt and the two local entities proceed to drink for the next 10 minutes, with Agent Blunt drinking directly from the bottle and the two entities drinking from their own crystal glass)

**Agent Blunt:** (Leans against backpack and raises her bottle) Ah! Now that’s some good stuff.

**{ I’ll take that as a compliment on my work. (Burps and turns around to stare at something off-camera) Now, now, isn’t it impolite to stare from the dark like that? Especially when we have such a good guest! Did you stew in this place to the point that you forget your manners? }**

**&lt; (Raises drinking glass and giggles) Come on, sneaky ones, show yourselves! Or he will brew you on his shelves! &gt;**

(Silence for 10 seconds, except Agent Blunt taking another sip from her bottle)

(**~ The spiky one ~** and **/ The messenger in white /** slowly enters camera view and approaches the trio)

(Agent Blunt manages to bow at the two new entities despite half-lying on the mat, raising her bottle once more as an additional greeting)

**Agent Blunt:** Well, good evening, folks! (Burps) Interested in our sorrows? Please, help yourselves. 

(After a moment of hesitance, the two new entities sit down beside Agent Blunt)

**~ H – hello, young guest. Your sorrow is…tragic indeed. And it brings back memories, which are more than precious here. We owe you a thank you and an apology. ~**

**Agent Blunt:** (Waves hand in dismissal) Don’t sweat it. All you did was stare at us for a while. (Burps) Back… Back when I was working with the group of three arrows, they stared at me from multiple angles. All the time. (Downs the entire bottle of beverage)

**{ Sound eerily similar to the place that haunts us. }**

(**/ The garland-bearer /** takes a new bottle of beverage, uncaps it, and hands it to Agent Blunt)

**Agent Blunt:** (Accepts the bottle with both hands) Thanks. It’s similar, yes – all these big groups operate like that. Watch, calculate, control. (Takes a long sip from her bottle) 

(**{ The bearded one }** pours a cup of beverage for each of the new entities, which they immediately start to drink after bowing in gratitude)

**Agent Blunt:** And you know what’s the best part? Their own arrogance just loves to slap them in the face. Things go south, and we’ll have to clean it up. They haven’t even found that traitor yet, and who knows? I might do it for them just for the sake of my old comrades.

**&lt; Backstabber in the equation! What a surprise! Go get them, girl, set them on fire! (Starts swaying drinking glass in a dancing motion) Down goes the namestealer! &gt;**

**{ (Raises drinking glass for a toast) Down goes the namestealer! }**

**The Rest of the Group:** (Raises drinking glass/bottle for a toast) Down goes the namestealer!

(The group proceeds to eat and drink for the next 20 minutes)

**Agent Blunt:** (Burps and puts down her bottle) Alright, folks, thank you for the great time, but… (Burps) I guess it’s my time to go.

(Agent Blunt attempts to stand up, her body swaying and footing unstable due to presumed alcohol intoxication)

(The native entities attempt to help her, but she manages to stable herself before they get close enough)

**Agent Blunt:** I… I don’t know if I can really help her, but… If I can’t, I will find someone or something that can do it. I… I’m not letting that arrogant woman slip away like this. (Looks up to the sky) Who knows? I might be able to find your names in the process. (Turns around to smile at the entities) I’ll make sure to send them back if that happens. 

(Agent Blunt gets up and pats her clothes to remove the dust, giving the local entities one last salute)

**Agent Blunt:** So long, folks! See you around!

(Agent Blunt slowly walks off)

**/ Please stay safe, and do come again! /** 

(Agent Blunt waves her right hand without looking back)

(The local entities wave Agent Blunt goodbye until she exits camera view)

**&lt;End Logs&gt;**
