+ A TRAILER

**0:00-0:05:**
Darkness. Short, gasping breaths.
Close up on DR. OBROV&#39;s flickering eyes. They snap open.

**0:06-0:08:**
Dr. Obrov stands rigid next to his bed, looking at his sleeping wife. It is dark outside.

**0:09-0:12:**
ERIN storms into the office of ELLY, her superior. She slams a black and white photograph of a group of men and women down on the table.

**0:13-0:20:**
Pan down a row of battle weary soldiers standing in a muddy trench. They are dressed in filthy cleric uniforms, holding rifles. A giant, sentient piece of origami stands behind them, cocking its head.

Voice-over, an old man: &#34;So from what we can see, he was killed right before starting his work.&#34;

**0:21-0:25:**
Dr. Obrov is making coffee in his neat bare kitchen. Then, he is driving along a dark highway in a truck, looking intense.

**0:27-0:31:**
The truck pulls off down a dirt road surrounded by fence. A sign warns of trespassing on private land.
Voice-over, old man: &#34;Not that that matters, now.&#34;

**0:28-0:31:**
Erin jabs at a man in the photograph. 

She says &#34;Now I want an explanation.&#34;

**0:32-0:34:** 
Elly photographing [[[SCP-173]]].

**0:35-0:36:** 
A gloved hand slips a pill in a percolator.

**0:37-0:43:**
DIANA OLIVIER hurries through a Church of The Second Hytoth office, panting. She carries papers in her arms.

Voice-over, Erin: &#34;If this is him in the photo, then he would have been eighty at the time of his death.&#34;

**0:44-0:47:**
Something heavy and just out of view drags itself around a containment chamber. A canine howl.

**0:48-0:50:**
Dr. Obrov, USB stick in hand, grabs a cup of lukewarm coffee before returning to his desk.

**0:51-0:52:** 
A camera flash.

**0:53-0:55:** 
Close-up on Dr. Obrov&#39;s lips as he takes a sip.

**0:56-0:57:** 
A second camera flash.

**0:58-1:07:** 
A crowd of Foundation investigators crowd around Dr. Obrov&#39;s corpse. 

Voice-over, old man: &#34;So it was cyanide poisoning, was it?&#34;

**1:08-1:15:** 
Diana is praying.

Voice-over, a younger man: &#34;Yes, but who cares? He was a nonentity.&#34;

**1:16-1:20:** 
Members of Mobile Task Force Psi-9 burst in on a Sarkic masked orgy. Distant laughter.

Voice over, the younger man again: &#34;Nothing matters.&#34;

**1:21-1:26:** 
Elly, Erin, and a Japanese doctor are setting up an experimental camera in a field. The laughter builds.

**1:27-1:31:**
Dr. Obrov&#39;s wife is sitting in a room, weeping violently. The walls drip blood. The laughter gets louder.

**1:32-1:35:** 
Researchers look through glass at some sort of wounded animal. The laughter gets more manic.

**1:36-1:40:**
 Erin stands in a suburban kitchen, slowly turning to look at an air conditioner. The air conditioner twitches. The laughter is now loud, whooping, and completely deranged.

**1:41-1:42:**
 Continuing laughter. A building on fire.

**1:42-1:43:** 
Continuing laughter. A doctor peeling off his face.

**1:44-1:45:** 
Continuing laughter. A bare foot steps on concrete.

**1:46-1:47:** 
Continuing laughter. A man in an orange jumpsuit chained to a chair in a concrete room, watching something on a television.

**1:48-1:49:** 
Laughter builds to an insane peak. A camera lens in close-up, filming something it is not meant to see.

**1:50-1:51:** 
[[[SCP-2006]]], in its Robot-Man form, jumps out from behind a door. It says &#34;Boo!&#34; Cut to black.

**1:53-2:01:** 
Title slowly fades in: THE UNDOING.

Voice over, Elly: &#34;You can see the outlines of it now, can&#39;t you? Something lurking at the edges. He tried to unmake himself, you see?

**2:02-2:15:** 
Cut to Elly entering her house. She turns and sees DIRECTOR VAN TURNER standing in the shadows. He flashes a brilliant smile, his eyes hidden. Elly screams in absolute terror. End trailer.
