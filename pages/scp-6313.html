**Item #:** SCP-6313

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All Site-88 employees are to be briefed on SCP-6313&#39;s anomalous properties. Knowledge of SCP-6313&#39;s current location is to be limited to whichever individual currently possesses it. 

Site-88 staff are directed to deny requests for information relating to SCP-6313&#39;s current owner or location. Under no circumstances is this information to be speculated on.

Once every six months, a site-wide announcement will be made to assist in the determination of SCP-6313&#39;s current status. If it is determined with any level of certainty that SCP-6313 is no longer in the possession of the SCP Foundation, this documentation is to be updated, and the SCP-6313 project head is to be alerted.

**Description:** SCP-6313 is a collection of dried thyme leaves. SCP-6313&#39;s current location and velocity cannot be simultaneously known by more than one individual (known as SCP-6313-1 in this document). Due to difficulties in acquiring SCP-6313 for research, the exact mechanism by which this anomaly affects both SCP-6313 and SCP-6313-1 is not fully understood. It is theorized, however, that SCP-6313 possesses macroscopic qualities similar to those possessed by quantum particles.

Once two or more individuals learn either the location or velocity of SCP-6313, the object will no longer be found at its last known location. Video records of displacement events have shown it to disapparate from previously known locations instantaneously. SCP-6313 is generally found afterwards by another individual. Records of previous translocation events indicate that SCP-6313 will not appear more than a certain distance [[footnote]]Due to potential variability relating to exact knowledge of this distance, that information has been removed from this document.[[/footnote]] from the individual possessing knowledge of its location.

The following log displays previously known holders of SCP-6313, and the events which triggered the relocation of the object. There is a 13 month gap in knowledge between Mrs. Dobson&#39;s loss of the object and Dr. Foster acquiring the object.

||~ Previous Owner ||~ Occupation||~ Log of Events||
|| Mark Reinhart || Civilian chef in Bay Minnette || Attempted to introduce SCP-6313 to a dish he was preparing. Once it was removed from its packaging it disapparated in the presence of the kitchen staff.||
|| Phyllis Dobson || Mid-level Executive, Southern Crosscut Pines [[footnote]]A Foundation front company.[[/footnote]] || Discovered SCP-6313 in her purse once she arrived home. It disapparated once she attempted to alert her husband to its presence. Both reported the incident to the SCP Foundation. ||
|| Dr. Phillip Foster || SCP Foundation, Senior Researcher || Found SCP-6313 in his glove box when arriving for work at Site-88. Since understanding of SCP-6313 was low at the time, he attempted to bring the object to the Site&#39;s research head, but it disapparated upon presentation.|| 
|| Kay June || SCP Foundation, Janitorial Staff || As Ms. June was unaware of SCP-6313&#39;s anomalous properties, it was used to decorate and alter the fragrance of a janitorial closet. It was in this location for approximately 34 months. Ms. June was then transferred to Site-43. SCP-6313 was discovered by her replacement, causing the object to disapparate.|| 
|| Dr. Lillian Una || SCP Foundation, SCP-2343 containment supervisor || Dr. Una was one of the few SCP Staff members to be fully briefed on the potential relocation of SCP-6313. She possessed SCP-6313 for approximately 17 days before the object was intentionally disapparated under the current containment procedures.|| 

In August of 2021, a site-wide announcement was made in order to determine the containment status of SCP-6313. At this time, no Foundation staff have come forward with information relating to SCP-6313. It is believed that containment still holds, but is poorly suited to evaluation of its own success or failure.

The following announcement should be repeated once weekly until SCP-6313&#39;s status is determined.

&gt; This is an announcement relating to SCP-6313. Anyone who has the thyme should immediately proceed to observation room C for debriefing.

A redesign of SCP-6313&#39;s containment procedures is currently underway.
