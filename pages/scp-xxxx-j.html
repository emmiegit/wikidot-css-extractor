**Description:** SCP-XXXX-J is a##purple|n unbranded## ##red|blue## --##red|electronic##-- ##8B8000|electric##[[footnote]]##8B8000|&#34;Electronic&#34; sounds really pretentious.

[[size 125%]]**If staff by any reason are feeling traumatized by reading this document, they are instructed to contact their site therapist. If a staff member has any changes they would like to make, they are --encouraged to contact Anderson Pale via email-- to keep this thought to themselves and continue doing their work. Failure to follow these instructions will result in staff punishment of being forced to use SCP-XXXX-J to brush their teeth.**[[/size]]

=====
&gt; Original concept/idea for the anomaly found on [[[fragments|the Fragments page]]]. The post is shown below. I doubt this is what the author expected would happen with it, but it’s happening.
&gt; ------
&gt; By [[*user Amelia Eardly]]
&gt; An object that only exists in a certain hour/minute/secondof the day. Either every single day, or once a week, month, year, ect. Whenever the time it exists in it runs out, it ceases to exist with no signs as to it ever being there.
