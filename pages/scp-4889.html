**Item #:** SCP-4889

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Early Containment Procedures:** The forested area that SCP-4889 is located in is surrounded by two-meter tall chain-link fencing in a 120 meter radius from its exact location. Foundation interaction is currently restricted to remote observation until more information about SCP-4889-A is known and a safe method of capture for it is proposed. Secondary containment objectives include identifying SCP-4889-A&#39;s origin and known relatives.

**Description:** SCP-4889 refers to a snowshoe hare (//Lepus americanus//) 49 cm in length. It is located approximately 9 km northeast of Lake Cavanaugh in Washington State.

SCP-4889 is unable to leave the rock it stands on; the bottom of its paws are fused to the rock by unknown means. In addition, SCP-4889 possesses a regenerative trait, being able to replace lost tissue and organs.

SCP-4889-A is a human of indeterminate age, though it is presumed to be in its mid-twenties. Its clothing has not changed since its discovery.

Approximately 2 hours after snowfall in the area SCP-4889 resides in, SCP-4889-A will appear and devour SCP-4889 alive. This process varies in length, ranging from 30-120 minutes. Approximately 30 minutes after, SCP-4889 will begin regenerating its organs and rebuilding torn muscle and flesh, as well as regaining consciousness.

As inferred from observation, SCP-4889-A seems to do this out of survival, although it is also possible that it is doing so as ritual.

**Observation Log:** Below is recorded footage taken via discreet cameras and microphones in the forest surrounding SCP-4889.

**OBSERVATION LOG TRANSCRIPT**

**Date:** February 9th, 2019

-----

**[BEGIN LOG]**

//SCP-4889 is still. Little activity for approximately three minutes. A soft crunching noise can be heard approaching from the west. SCP-4889-A enters the frame, moving past the trees and towards SCP-4889. SCP-4889-A has a noticeable limp, putting more weight on its right leg.//

//SCP-4889-A slows its pace into a halt.//

//SCP-4889-A looks around all directions.//

//It is still for approximately 30 seconds before approaching SCP-4889. SCP-4889 attempts to move from its stone but fails. SCP-4889-A crouches down and shushes it, putting its left hand on SCP-4889&#39;s back and petting it. SCP-4889 ceases moving, save for visibly quick breaths.//

//SCP-4889-A puts its other hand on SCP-4889 and feels its body, paying little attention to the paws and rear end.//

**SCP-4889-A:** You&#39;re a little bigger tonight, I see. Must&#39;ve been several days since the last snow. Or maybe little meat left over. Yeah... Probably that.

//SCP-4889-A feels around SCP-4889&#39;s ears.//

**SCP-4889-A:** Still soft. I&#39;ve always liked your ears.

//SCP-4889-A makes a noise suggesting the retracting of saliva. SCP-4889 is visibly startled by this.//

**SCP-4889-A:** Oh! Sorry, sorry. Didn&#39;t mean to scare you. I&#39;m sorry. Shh shh sshhhh. It&#39;s okay.

//SCP-4889-A repeats these phrases for approximately 40 seconds, then sits directly in front of SCP-4889.//

//Everything is still for approximately twenty seconds.//

**SCP-4889-A:** Brother came to visit me. Said that he&#39;s almost done with college. I told you about that, right? ... I think I did. I didn&#39;t say anything; I don&#39;t really want to. He knows that -- I know he knows that.

//SCP-4889-A retracts its hands and rests them on its knees.//

**SCP-4889-A:** ... It&#39;s not why he came, though. Told me dad started coughing up again. He said... He said it&#39;s because...

//SCP-4889-A rubs its left leg with both hands.//

**SCP-4889-A:** ... Because it&#39;s my fault. But how is it my fault if I don&#39;t know how much I should eat?

//SCP-4889-A takes a few deep breaths.//

**SCP-4889-A:** I told him, &#34;You act like you&#39;ve got it harder than me.&#34; ...

//Everything is still for a brief moment. SCP-4889-A laughs lightly.//

**SCP-4889-A:** He didn&#39;t like that. Not one bit. But... But what am I supposed to do, right? He ain&#39;t helping me. Dad definitely ain&#39;t helping me. If he&#39;s so &#34;alive and well&#34;, then where is he, huh? ... And you know what he said?

//SCP-4889-A rubs its left leg.//

**SCP-4889-A:** &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; That&#39;s all he ever says when he has to do this. But he doesn&#39;t mean it. I know he doesn&#39;t mean it.

//SCP-4889-A sits quietly for a moment. It reaches out and pets SCP-4889.//

**SCP-4889-A:** They should be thanking me. I did more for them than they&#39;ll ever do for me.

//SCP-4889-A lifts its hands off of SCP-4889. It is still for approximately 20 seconds. SCP-4889-A shifts onto its knees and lowers its head. Mumbling is heard, but cannot be understood. It slowly bends down and holds its face in its hands.//

//Everything is still for approximately five minutes.//

//SCP-4889-A sharply inhales from its nose. SCP-4889 is visibly startled by this.//

//SCP-4889-A draws a thin knife from its boot. It stabs the blade into SCP-4889.//

//SCP-4889 screams.//

**SCP-4889-A:** Stop. Please stop.

//SCP-4889-A places its free hand on SCP-4889 and begins carving through the muscle. SCP-4889 continues to scream, struggling to move.//

**SCP-4889-A:** ... Please just stop.

//SCP-4889-A pulls out chunks of muscle and organs from SCP-4889 while it shrieks. SCP-4889-A tugs the muscle away from their connective tissues and places a few pieces into its mouth. SCP-4889 screams louder.//

**SCP-4889-A:** I said stop crying!

//SCP-4889-A bats its fist down on SCP-4889&#39;s skull and neck four times, each time making contact with the stone it is resting on. It does not lift up its neck. SCP-4889-A sets down the meat on the stone and lifts up SCP-4889&#39;s head.//

//SCP-4889&#39;s cries are muffled by SCP-4889-A&#39;s closed fist. It beats on the skull ten more times.//

**SCP-4889-A:** ... I&#39;m sorry.

//SCP-4889-A lets go of SCP-4889 and it falls limp. SCP-4889-A resumes its previous position after 30 seconds. It looks at the viscera on the stone and hesitantly picks out a piece of flesh. It then proceeds to eat it slowly. While chewing, it carves out more meat from SCP-4889. This continues for approximately 39 minutes. SCP-4889 and SCP-4889-A are silent during this time.//
