**Item#**: SCP-4696

**Object Class**: Safe 

**Secure Containment Procedures**: SCP-4696 must be locked in a Secure Storage Vault when not being tested. Testing must be approved by Head Researcher Eddlestone and take place under the supervision of at least one member of Security Staff.

**Description**: SCP-4696 is a stuffed animal resembling a large, oddly shaped gorilla, currently 73cm in height and weighing 3kg. Internal inspection reveals it to be composed of a variety of stuffing materials, typical to stuffed plush toys. Signs of aging, tearing, and distended bulging caused by overstuffing are visible on SCP-4696&#39;s exterior. No identifying tags or labels of manufacture have been found on SCP-4696.

Anomalous behavior manifests when placed within a 1-meter radius of other stuffed animals. When this requirement is met, both SCP-4696 and the stuffed animals in its vicinity, now designated SCP-4696-1, will begin showing signs of sentience and awareness.  

SCP-4696 will invariably attempt to destroy SCP-4696-1 instances and, if successful, will then proceed to remove the stuffing from its victims before adding it to its own mass. Neither SCP-4696 or SCP-4696-1 are capable of vocalization, however, SCP-4696-1 instances can be seen to be extremely fearful of SCP-4696. 

SCP-4696 was discovered after a video uploaded to the YouTube account &#34;Jamies Animal Tournament&#34;[[footnote]] Account has been removed following Foundation intervention. [[/footnote]] was flagged by online searches.

POI-4696-1, formally known as 10-year-old Jamie Miller, was SCP-4696&#39;s former owner and creator of the &#34;Jamies Animal Tournament&#34; Youtube account. Numerous interviews have cleared them of any anomalous abilities with POI-4696-1 insisting to have found SCP-4696 on the street outside their school. The Miller Family has been placed under constant surveillance to monitor for potential future anomalous activity.

&gt; 
&gt; //POI-4696-1 makes crowd noises//
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-4696-1**: &#34;I guess this video is just to introduce him and also to make an announcement. Since the newest tournament barely began yet, I&#39;ve decided to begin-- to restart it again so that Gronk can take part. So yeah!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-4696-1**: &#34;I&#39;m gonna end the video now but I will record a battle right after dinner and upload it tomorrow! See you guys next time! Rooooar!&#34;

&gt; //POI-4696-1 bursts into laughter and steps away, composing himself.//
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-4696-1**: &#34;Anyway, let&#39;s begin the fight. Ladies and Gentleman today&#39;s battle will be between the newbie, Gronk... Versus the mighty Rhinor! Gronk is gonna have a tough time because Rhinor almost made it to the finals last tourma--tournament!&#34;

&gt; 
&gt; //POI-4696-1 moves SCP-4696 toward the rhinoceros giddily making it &#34;eat&#34; the stuffing, emulating chewing sounds and stuffing a small amount into the existing tear near its mouth.//
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-4696-1**: &#34;Oh my gosh! Gronk is eating all the guts out of Rhynor&#39;s arm! Nobody can stop this monster!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; //POI-4696-1 proceeds to &#34;pin&#34; the rhinoceros in a manner similar to popular wrestling shows.//
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-4696-1**: &#34;One! Two! Threeee! Gronk wins!&#34;
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; **POI-4696-1**: &#34;Ladies and Gentlemen, today&#39;s match is a big one! The former tournament champion, Tiger X, will be fighting the unsp--unstoppable killing machine, Gronk!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; //POI-4696-1 brings a stuffed tiger into view from the left of the screen.//
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; **POI-4696-1**: Oh no! It looks like Gronk is gonna do his new finishing move! The Gut Squash!

&gt; 
&gt; **POI-4696-1**: &#34;Woah... He totally exploded Tiger X... I guess that makes Gronk the winner but... Tiger X was my favorite animal. So that kinda sucks.
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-4696-1**: &#34;Okay, so I&#39;ll see you guys in the next battle. Thanks for watching and subscribing... And yeah... Okay bye.

&gt; 
&gt; **POI-4696-1**: &#34;I had to put him in the closet alone because he was hurting the others. I don&#39;t know if I should tell mom because she&#39;d be really mad that my animals are broken... I&#39;m gonna stop recording videos for a while but if Gronk calms down hopefully we can make more better vi--

&gt; **POI-4696-1**: &#34;Okay I&#39;m gonna go now.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; //Video ends.//

POI-4696-1 claims that after filming this video, they removed SCP-4696 from their residence and disposed of it near a dumpster by the local shopping mall. At this point, no records exist that track SCP-4696&#39;s movements in the 2 months between the last video and the date of containment. 

[[/collapsible]]

//Incident-4696-A//: SCP-4696 was contained after a Facebook livestream showed it attacking a stuffed bear at a carnival. A containment team was ordered to head to the location, arriving to find SCP-4696 inert, next to a neutralized SCP-4696-1 instance. The livestream was scrubbed and cover stories were disseminated of it being a viral marketing stunt for a new toy line. Witnesses were interviewed and amnestized to further cloud the veracity of the incident.

&gt; = //The following is an audio transcript of Agent Lannister (AL) interrogating the teen, named Terrance Welding (TW), who livestreamed the incident regarding SCP-4696//:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **AL**: &#34;Okay, so. Let&#39;s go over this again, you were with your girlfriend and-&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **TW**: &#34;She&#39;s not my girlfriend... Look it&#39;s complicated.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **AL**: &#34;Yeah, okay sure, kid. Look, just go over what you saw again.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **TW**: (Sighs) &#34;So like, I&#39;ve got the camera on Sasha, right? We just got off the big wheel and I decide... Hey, I&#39;m gonna go ahead and win her a stuffed animal. One of those big ones, right?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **AL**: &#34;Yeah, of course, girls love those.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **TW**: &#34;Exactly! So like, we&#39;re walking toward the booth where you throw those rings over the soda bottles.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **AL**: &#34;It&#39;s called a hoop toss.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **TW**: &#34;Right, the hoop toss, that&#39;s when we hear this little girl scream.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **AL**: &#34;What did you see?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **TW**: &#34;We walk over and see one of those big teddy bears like-- flailing on the ground. The dude in the booth is just like, standing there with his mouth open.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **AL**: &#34;What happened then?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **TW**: &#34;I mean, at first I&#39;m like, bruh... Then I&#39;m thinking, there&#39;s probably a dude in there, I think I saw some shit like that on YouTube.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **AL**: &#34;Language.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **TW**: &#34;My bad. Anyway, as I&#39;m thinking this, the big bear stands up and like-- tries to reach behind its back. It can&#39;t reach, though. So, it&#39;s like, just twisting round and round until a fucking stuffed gorilla bursts out of its back!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **AL**: &#34;Langu-- you know what, nevermind.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **TW**: &#34;So yeah, this gorilla is like tearing at the bear and obviously, there&#39;s no dude inside. Its just ripping bundles of wool from the bear and stuffing it into its leg. So I&#39;m like &#39;No way!&#39;, this is some Five Nights at Freddy type of bullshit.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **AL**: &#34;The what nights of who now?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **TW**: &#34;It&#39;s a video game, about these animatronic animals going mad and trying to kill you.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **AL**: &#34;So at this point, you think they&#39;re robots?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **TW**: &#34;Yeah! I mean what else could they be? Anyway, that&#39;s when I stopped streaming and soon after that their batteries must&#39;ve died because they just flopped on the ground.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **AL**: &#34;Right, you&#39;re a smart kid. How about you drink your water, it&#39;s a crazy story.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **TW**: &#34;Nah, not really thirsty.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **AL**: &#34;Drink the water, kid.&#34;

= __**SCP-4696 TEST LOGS**__


||~ TEST4696/01 ||
|| Conditions||SCP-4696 is placed in testing chamber within 3 meters of a stuffed zebra.||
||Result||SCP-4696 remains inert for 3 minutes before rapidly moving its head to face the stuffed zebra. No aggressive behavior takes place.||

------

||~ TEST4696/02 ||
|| Conditions||SCP-4696 is placed in testing chamber within 1 meter of a stuffed zebra. ||
||Result||SCP-4696 stands up and approaches the zebra, now an SCP-4696-1 instance. SCP-4696 picks the zebra up by its rear legs, faint fabric noises are heard as it spreads the limbs and begins slowly tearing it in half. SCP-4696-1 instance makes distressed flailing movements until seemingly expiring after a majority of its stuffing falls out. SCP-4696 begins cramming loose stuffing into its arms for 2 minutes before collapsing on the chamber floor.||

------

||~ TEST4696/03 ||
|| Conditions||SCP-4696 is placed in testing chamber within 1 meter of a &#39;Max Steel&#39; action figure. ||
||Result||SCP-4696 stands up and approaches the action figure, which does not move. After a moment, SCP-4696 appears to &#34;sniff&#34; the figure before making &#34;roaring&#34; movements. SCP-4696 pushes the action figure over, sits down and collapses.||

------

||~ TEST4696/05 ||
|| Conditions||SCP-4696 is placed in testing chamber within 1 meter of a &#39;Cabbage Patch Kid&#39; doll. ||
||Result||SCP-4696 stands up and approaches the doll, now an SCP-4696-1 instance, stirring on the floor. SCP-4696 is seen dragging its left leg, which has been recently lengthened due to stuffing. The doll, facing away from SCP-4696, does not notice it standing nearby. The SCP-4696-1 instance appears to be inspecting its hands and arms before finally noticing SCP-4696&#39;s presence. The doll backs up in fear as SCP-4696 slowly closes the distance between them. SCP-4696-1 bumps into the rear wall of the containment chamber, before being picked up by the neck area. SCP-4696 plunges its hand into the doll&#39;s abdomen area and pulls out a large ball of stuffing before packing it into the SCP-4696-1&#39;s mouth area[[footnote]] This line of Cabbage Patch Kids (The Cabbage Patch Snacktime Kids), was designed to &#34;eat&#34; plastic snacks. The mechanism enabling this was a pair of one-way smooth metal rollers behind plastic lips which lead to a backpack on its rear.  [[/footnote]]. SCP-4696-1 makes distressed movements and flails as it attempts to stop SCP-4696, striking it in the face. SCP-4696 stops and seems to stare at the doll for 10 seconds before punching a hole in the plastic molded face of SCP-4696-1. The doll drops to the ground as it appears to be choking up balls of stuffing, clutching onto its abdomen. SCP-4696 kicks it onto its back before pulling out and cramming stuffing into a hole near its own mouth area. Both SCP-4696 and SCP-4696-1 cease anomalous behavior after 7 minutes.||
