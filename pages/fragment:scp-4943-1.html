&gt; 
&gt; ##orange|IN WHAT CONTEXT?##
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|it&#39;s hard to explain. it&#39;s something i can see, if you can call it that. some others too, like c:\\users\public and a few others.##

&gt; 
&gt; ##red|so i&#39;m stuck in a computer with a bunch of people who know nothing about computers. very comforting.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##green|Give me a second. I need to wrap my head around this.
&gt; Okay. Ive got an idea but Im going to need everyones help.
&gt; Dr. Bishop and Osiris, see if you can figure out how to send data over the network. If you can, try to get an email out letting someone know were here. I dont care who, anyone who might read it.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|any idea how we would do that##
&gt; 
&gt; ##green|Not really. We&#39;re all shooting in the dark here. Figure it out.
&gt; Dr Bold, come up with a way to communicate once we get help. Maybe a file on the desktop or someplace obvious.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##orange|YOU GOT IT MORGAN. AND YOU CAN CALL ME CAL.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##green|Cal it is.
&gt; Quinn, you said you were with investigations right? Poke around and see if you can figure out how we got here. That might be the key to getting back out.
&gt; Any questions?##
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|what about you? don&#39;t tell me you were planning on pinning all the work on us.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##green|Actually I was going to take a look at the sound drivers. If I can make enough noise I might be able to get some eyes on us.
&gt; Sound good?##

&gt; So we cant get anything out on the network now.
&gt; We tried using the speakers.
&gt; We tried changing the desktop background.
&gt; Dr Bishop has disappeared into oblivion.
&gt; If the clock Quinn found is accurate weve been in here for about a week.
&gt; And we still have no idea how we got here in the first place.
&gt; Im going to be straight with yall, Im running out of ideas.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##orange|I&#39;VE BEEN THINKING THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET SOME EYES IF WE SHUT DOWN THE SYSTEM.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|ah, suicide. always a great way to get attention.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##orange|NOT NECESSARILY. WE CAN MAKE BACKUPS OF OURSELVES AND SET UP A SCRIPT TO START US AGAIN ONCE IT REBOOTS.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##Green|Its not the worst idea, but Id rather save anything that might kill us until we have no other options.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##orange|FAIR ENOUGH.##

&gt; ##blue|i found out what happened to bishop
&gt; he got lost
&gt; i found some files he left trying to find us 
&gt; if hes still alive theres not much left of him##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|just think about it for a second
&gt; weve been here for weeks now
&gt; if anyone was coming they would have found us by now
&gt; or worse maybe they have and are just using us as their guinea pigs##

&gt; ##orange|OSIRIS, CALM DOWN. 
&gt; WE ARE GOING TO GET OUT OF HERE, WHATEVER IT TAKES.##

&gt; ##blue|stay if you want but im not going to sit around and wait to slowly lose my mind 
&gt; goodbye##

&gt; Osiris!##
