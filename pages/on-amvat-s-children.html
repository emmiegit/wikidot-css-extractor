++ Chronicle of Ulak the Drifter

+++ Annotated by Shahrazad Keret

Sapient life often resembles the creatures it evolved from. Amvat is not the exception to this rule. Most civilizations and peoples here have based their entire culture on surviving at any cost. Thus, it must not be surprising that many of them are hostile, warlike and predatory. Attacking and capturing other peoples for slavery, consumption and ritual sacrifice is daily life for the //Amvatiaa// or Amvat&#39;s children. Those peoples who do not engage in the constant violence of their neighbors have discovered other ways of subsistence. Some have domesticated several of this planet&#39;s few non-carnivorous creatures, while others have laid claim to a //Naaj-Kioo// and learned the ways of agriculture, establishing permanent settlements.
 
Nevertheless, these are exceptions to the nomadic way of life that most //Amvatiaa// practice. Most tribes follow a pattern of movement. They travel from oasis to oasis to sustain themselves and their animals. At the end of the day, they seek the protection of the spirit-talons, against the merciless cold of the night. During the day, they are besieged by predatory animals and tribes, and must face their ever-hostile environment.   

The term //Amvatiaa// designates a variety of tribes and species, each with their own racial characteristics, way of life, culture and belief system. While there are undoubtedly many that I did not meet during my journey, I had the pleasure of knowing those species and tribes who I would consider to be the protagonists of Amvatian history. The following is a list of these races, including a brief description of each&#39;s biology, dwellings and culture. The following is a summary of the most important races and cultures on Amvat, be they nomadic or sedentary.

------

[[tabview]]
[[tab The Bhalli]]
The most numerous species on Amvat, the Bhalli (meaning &#34;elders&#34; are a hardy people. Composed mostly by poor nomadic herders, they travel from one //Naaj-Kioo// to another to sustain themselves and their animals.[[footnote]] In most Bhalli cultures, the main drive of the people is to find an oasis for themselves, to settle down and escape the cruelty of the desert.  [[/footnote]]  They are organized in numerous tribes and factions, far too many to enlist here, each with their own cultural traits.[[footnote]] There are as many different ethnic, racial and cultural groups within the Bhalli as there are amongst Terran species, such as humans, faeries, dragons, dwarfs and elves. – S.K.  [[/footnote]]  However, most Bhalli activities resemble those of early civilizations, being a combination of hunting-gathering, rearing cattle, and war. While many Bhalli are peaceful and even friendly, most tribes follow a philosophy based around the survival of the fittest, being more than willing to kill and enslave their fellow tribes if given the chance. There are even some cannibalistic Bhalli who subsist entirely on raiding and capturing other //Amvatiaa// for consumption.   

Despite their barbaric habits and humble lifestyle, the Bhalli are the true protagonists of Amvat&#39;s history. They are, according to themselves, the first child-race of Amvat, and were there to presence the deeds of their gods. It is the Bhalli who carve the //Daa-Xiek// with their achievements and their beliefs. Theirs are the great legends and anecdotes of heroes and demigods. It is they who continue to be loyal to the ancient rites of religion and magic given to them by the Goddess. Truly, the Bhalli have every reason in the Multiverse to be proud of themselves as a people. 

The Bhalli are strongly built, though most ethnic groups within the species are quite short.[[footnote]] The Bhalli are short for an Uhb&#39;Seq like me. The Bhalli are, on average, 1.4 meters tall, while an average Uhb&#39;Seq is not shorter than 2.2 meters in height. There are exceptions, of course. Some Bhalli races are as tall as 1.8 meters.  [[/footnote]]  While there are many racial differences within their species, most of them have broad noses, reddish skin, and deep amber eyes. The males are completely bald, while the females have long, silky hair, which they tie in complicated knots and arrangements. Most tribes wear no clothes at all, and merely adorn themselves with rudimentary jewelry and tattoos, which have religious significance. At most, they use large cloaks to protect themselves from the suns&#39; harshest rays during the day and to resist the cold at night. 

Water is an essential element for the Bhalli. Being the source of life, the Bhalli follow a strict code regarding it, known as //Juh-Lai//, the Law of Water. This law stipulates the following three principles. 

1.	The sanctity of water. Water must be kept pure, free of contaminants that might make it undrinkable. To pollute water is the gravest blasphemy that could be committed. Whoever dares do such a thing is branded a //vih-ku//, a &#34;forsaken sinner,&#34; and forced to wander the desert alone. It is a terrible fate, for these individuals are branded with a burning curse on their foreheads that makes them nearly immortal, but subject of an unquenchable thirst. They eventually go mad and become violent, bestial creatures, hostile to all life, including each other.

2.	The Blessings must be shared. Water from a //Naaj-Kioo// cannot be refused to anyone. Except for the //vih-ku//, Bhalli who have claimed a spring cannot deny visitors access to water. It is a law of hospitality and goodwill that ensures that no one who reaches a Blessing will die of thirst and upholds the value of generosity espoused by the Goddess herself. Some Bhalli are more generous than others. For instance, some settlements allow their guests to fill vases and pots with water for them to take into the desert, while others give them just the exact quantity to keep them from perishing.

3.	No blood must be shed near a Blessing. Blood pollutes water. It is as simple as that. To uphold the first rule, the Bhalli refrain from any kind of violence when visiting a spring. No matter what conflicts or grudges may exist between different Bhalli groups or individuals, blood must not be spilled. This is enforced with extreme prejudice by all settlements, and those that break the law inevitably become //vih-ku//, hated and spat on by all //Amvatiaa//.      

In the majority of Bhalli societies, the males are warriors and tend to the animals, while the females are gifted in magic and divination,[[footnote]] Thus, most spirit-talons are carved and honed by the female Bhalli.  [[/footnote]]  working as healers, priestesses, scribes[[footnote]] Outside of a select number of females, very few nomadic Bhalli can read and write, which contrasts with their sedentary counterparts, who are mostly literate. [[/footnote]]  and astronomers, guiding the tribe through its tribulations. Male Bhalli with magical abilities are an extremely rare occurrence, but whenever one is born, it is seen as a sign of good fortune for the tribe. Beyond this, gender roles in Bhalli societies are almost perfectly egalitarian, with both males and females caring for children and domestic tasks. The concept of marriage or monogamy is completely alien to the Bhalli. An individual may have as many sexual partners as they desire, and only holds the responsibility of rearing the children product of such unions.

The Bhalli have a large variety of rituals, dances and a very rich oral tradition. If there was ever any sign of culture and civilization on Amvat, I would not doubt to attribute it to the Bhalli. While they are still majorly nomadic, some of the greatest settlements on the planet&#39;s surface were created by the Bhalli, either alone, or in alliance with another species. In truth, they are a species worth the attention of any scholar or explorer.

[[/tab]]
[[tab The Yidh]]
The Yidh (literally &#34;valuable [ones]&#34; in their language[[footnote]] The language is called Yidh-Tal, &#34;Valuable Tongue.&#34; [[/footnote]]) are a peculiar species. Their skin is the lightest shade of blue, with aquamarine and gold markings spread throughout their bodies. Their faces are narrow, mostly hairless,[[footnote]] Older Yidh males eventually grow a long, thick beard, which is a symbol of status in their culture.  [[/footnote]]  with flat noses and sharp features. Their lean forms are covered by beautiful, intricately sewn robes and headdresses. Although they are neither tall[[footnote]] The Yidh are, on average, 1.8 meters tall. [[/footnote]]  nor muscular, they are strong enough to survive the desert&#39;s harshness with much more ease than other races, for their bodies require only occasional hydration. They can even change colors, albeit temporarily and with much strain to their bodies, which enables them to camouflage with their surroundings. Their species possesses a secondary set of arms, much like my own people, but instead of employing them for writing, the Yidh use these arms for commercial purposes, such as carrying their merchandise or accounting.

If the Imperial Commerce Guild[[footnote]] Ulak has had previous encounters with the Guild through his traveling of the Immortal Empire. He has also met the Lord Merchant and the Viceroys of Thuol. – S.K.  [[/footnote]]  ever met the Yidh, they would recruit them into their organization without a second thought. The Yidh’s religion is trade. Their entire lifestyle is based on commerce, and they excel at it. Master negotiators and dealers, they travel the inclement desert in caravans, carrying their precious goods from settlement to settlement, often approaching other nomadic peoples to trade with them. Whenever a Yidh caravan approaches a tribe, it is a time of celebration, for they carry with them items key to surviving in the desert, for which any tribe will gladly pay, no matter how high the price. 

Nothing is off-hands for the Yidh. There is nothing that cannot be appropriated, weighed and traded. Water, food, cattle, beasts of burden, clothing, medicine, slaves, weapons, magic… the Yidh possess all this, and more. The collective wealth of the entire Yidh tribes most likely exceeds any riches held by even the most powerful city-state on the planet. They have even helped build some of said cities, for the Yidh&#39;s most valuable merchandise is technology, which they scavenge from any marooned spacecraft and crash site they find. It is with this technology that marvels such as the Blessed Triad[[footnote]] The Blessed Triad is the unofficial designation for the three mightiest and most influential city-states on Amvat. They are Akkeddam the Walled City, Diemnia the Holy City and Tyrahn the Wandering City. [[/footnote]]  have built their power and influence.[[footnote]] I find it curious how most power on Amvat is focused on three city-states, just how the known Universe is mostly governed by the Immortal Empire, the Emerald Hegemony and the Solar Dominion. – S.K. [[/footnote]]  Were it not for their individual greed, which prevents cooperation, the Yidh would undoubtedly be the dominant species on Amvat.

The Yidh have only one permanent outpost, called Naerebat&#39;s Citadel. Named after its founder, the Yidh merchant-hero Naerebat, the Citadel is located on a colossal bridge that crosses the gaping abyss known as Jighare-Knaq.[[footnote]] &#34;The gifting maw.&#34; [[/footnote]]  At the bottom of this crevice lies a flowing river from which the citizens of Naerebat&#39;s Citadel obtain their precious water. 

The Citadel is notorious for being the most important trading hub on Amvat, besides the Wandering City. Aside from a few living quarters, the whole of the Citadel is a sprawling marketplace that rivals [[[https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/i-faust | Troll Market]]][[footnote]] A marketplace frequented since immemorable times by magical entities from every corner of Midgard. Most Ways leading to it are located on Earth. – S.K. [[/footnote]]  and [[[https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/shylock-s-quarter | Tibsom]]]  in size and Neik-Tav[[footnote]] The largest marketplace world of the Coalition of Merchant Kingdoms. – S.K. [[/footnote]]  and [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/there-are-no-strings-on-me | Utterly Bazaar]]]  in stock. Virtually anything on Amvat can be found there, from ancient tomes of magic and slaves to advanced technology and weapons. In truth, the Citadel is the hub of the Yidh&#39;s power, and even the Blessed Triad are careful not to provoke its wrath.

[[/tab]]
[[tab The Korrh]]
Every culture has a pantheon of their own.[[footnote]] In Party of Gods, Volume I, Ulak claims that the total number of deities and spirits in the Multiverse is most likely infinite, with only a minority ever getting involved in mortal affairs. – S.K.  [[/footnote]]  The gods and heroes of a culture protect it, guide its evolution and, eventually, set them on the path of independence and freedom. The Korrh are another story. According to myth, the Korrh are not born of the Goddess&#39; will and benevolence. Instead, the Korrh are the product of rape and violence, the incestuous offspring of the Goddess, born when she was defiled by her brother, the Desert. 

Korrh means, in the Bhalli common tongue,[[footnote]] //Bhalliavhi//, the elder language, is used as //lingua franca// by every species in Amvat. [[/footnote]]  &#34;accursed,&#34; and it is not an exaggeration. Their bodies, while strong when compared to the Bhalli, are extraordinarily deformed. Their bones, twisted and sharp, protrude from their flesh. Their skin is like old parchment, yellowish and dry, with pus-filled sores that never close and wounds that expose their organs and muscle tissue. They truly look like undead beings, rotting and twisting in perpetual agony.[[footnote]] Unlike vampires, zombies and revenants, the Korrh are very much alive. – S.K.  [[/footnote]]  Because of their deformities, the Korrh are each uniquely shaped, besides superficial similarities. In this respect, they are like demons,[[footnote]] It is widely known that no two demons look alike, even if they are blood relatives. – S.K. [[/footnote]]  and feared as such by most of the planet&#39;s inhabitants. 

The Korrh have a culture based on pain and suffering. They are violent savages that practice the darkest magics[[footnote]] Curiously, necromancy, while one of the Dark Arts, is not amongst the Korrh&#39;s field of expertise.  [[/footnote]]  and seek to inflict upon others the same pain they themselves suffer. While there are numerous Bhalli groups that have similarly violent practices, they are all for the sake of survival in their harsh environment. The Korrh, on the other hand, practice violence for the sake of violence. They travel in packs of five, actively hunting other beings to eat or to bring to their mating rituals. Said rituals are true monuments to horror, full of the foulest actions in the Multiverse. They are massive orgies where rape, murder, torture, mutilation, incest, cannibalism and miscellaneous debauchery are all present and welcome.          

The Korrh&#39;s reproduction cycle is horrendous of its own merit. After violent intercourse, the females spend little more than a day gestating their offspring,[[footnote]] It is uncommon for a female Korrh to give birth to less than twelve offspring per litter.  [[/footnote]]  which then gnaw their way out of the womb. The newborn Kohrr are as deformed and repulsive as their progenitors, and equally violent and sadistic. Their parents, assuming they did not perish during intercourse or childbirth, will attempt to defile and devour the weakest of the lot, and only teach their dark magic and violent ways to those that survive.

Being physically strong and proficient in dark magic, the Korrh are amongst the most dangerous beings on Amvat. They are the monsters that plague children&#39;s nightmares, and the subject of many a horror story to tell around the fire at night. They are so feared that even the most bloodthirsty of the Bhalli seek to appease them by leaving behind live captives for them to prey upon. Truly, there is no one in Amvat that desires an encounter with the Korrh.

The only advantage the Bhalli and other species have over the Korrh, is that, despite their freakish abilities and quick reproduction cycle, the Korrh are too violent to effectively cooperate. They often kill each other for the pettiest reasons, and it is not uncommon for Korrh individuals to present mutilations caused by their fellows. Given enough time, even the most efficient Korrh hunting pack turns against itself and suffers casualties severe enough to make them easy prey to a well-armed Bhalli tribe.
[[/tab]]
[[tab The Khae-Mok]]
The Khae-Mok (&#34;hallowed ones&#34;[[footnote]] This name is not in Bhalliavhi, the Amvatian //lingua franca//, but rather the &#34;High Tongue&#34; (//Heai Lim//) of the Khae-Mok. [[/footnote]] ) are a species of priests, sorcerers and scientists who dedicate themselves entirely to the discovery and exploration of Amvat&#39;s magical properties. Though they are gifted in combat magic, which makes them formidable opponents, they view an overemphasis on this branch of magic as a path to darkness and evil. For this reason, the Khae-Mok prefer to focus on more peaceful areas, such as healing, astronomy, plant manipulation and alchemy,[[footnote]] On the wider Intergalactic Community, alchemy is considered one of the three main bridges between magic and science, along with potion-crafting and techno-sorcery (also known as paratechnology). – S.K. [[/footnote]]  on all of which they are experts. The Khae-Mok claim not to be from Amvat, but rather from another realm that was destroyed in a cataclysmic war, which explains their pacifist tendencies.[[footnote]] There is no evidence to support this claim. [[/footnote]]   

The Khae-Mok are even taller than my own people,[[footnote]] The Khae-Mok are nearly 2.8 meters tall, which is closer to the height of an average river troll than an actual giant. – S.K. [[/footnote]]  and must seem as giants to the Bhalli. Their skin is very dark yet reflects light as if it were metallic. It almost appears to be made of obsidian, like the //Daa-Xiek//. Their faces look like they have been sculpted, chiseled into a perfectly symmetrical form.  They are very lean, though strong, with robust arms and long, thin digits. Their species is extremely long lived, with a thousand //uniuw//[[footnote]] The Amvatian year, equivalent to around 1.4 Terran years. – S.K. [[/footnote]]  being considered a short lifespan. 

The Khae-Mok are hermaphrodites, being able to change their sex under certain circumstances, such as a lack of partners of the opposite sex. Despite this and their long lifespans, the Khae-Mok are extremely few, with their numbers being in the lower hundreds. They are a species plagued by infertility, and their extinction once seemed imminent.[[footnote]] It is unknown if the IMPS would have been willing to restore the Khae-Mok. While they mostly resurrect non-sapient lifeforms, they have also been tasked with helping hundreds of sapient species escape extinction, particularly after the Krolovar Invasion. – S.K.  [[/footnote]]  This changed when the Khae-Mok discovered that, for reasons unknown, interbreeding with the Bhalli produced pure Khae-Mok offspring. 

With this discovery, the Khae-Mok formed a symbiotic relationship with certain Bhalli tribes, who call them //fahjil//.[[footnote]] &#34;Guardians.&#34; [[/footnote]]  The Bhalli offer them suitable partners for reproduction and in exchange, the Khae-Mok teach them magic and science,[[footnote]] All Khae-Mok are literate in most Amvatian languages, and their services as scribes and translators are sought after by all Bhalli, both nomadic and sedentary.  [[/footnote]]  helping the tribes to gain advantage and domain over the elements. In this manner, the Khae-Mok have been as instrumental as the Yidh merchants and the Bhalli laborers and architects in establishing the few permanent settlements found on the planet.   

[[/tab]]
[[tab The Silvarii]]
If there was ever a race worthy of study by scientists and magicians alike, it would be the Silvarii. Hailing from the hidden village of Viss-Mai, the Silvarii are close evolutionary relatives of the Bhalli.[[footnote]] The genetic difference between the Silvarii and the Bhalli is approximate to that between //Homo Sapiens// and //Cro-Magnon//. – S.K.  [[/footnote]]  However, there are several morphological differences between both species. For instance, the Silvarii are as lean as the Yidh, which contrast with the rather robust Bhalli. They are taller than their sister species,[[footnote]] The Silvarii are, on average, 1.7 meters in height.  [[/footnote]]  and much less resistant to Amvat&#39;s harshness. Their skin is soft, possessing a rather greenish-blue hue and is much more sensitive than that of the Bhalli. Their limbs have five digits instead of six, ending in slightly sharpened fingernails. Lastly, the Silvarii have a symbiotic relationship with a most unexpected ally: plant-life.

Viss-Mai, meaning &#34;Hidden Blessing&#34; in Silvarii tongue,[[footnote]] //Silvarii// is related to //Bhalliavhi//, the Bhalli trade language.  [[/footnote]]  is a village located within a massive fissure in the surface of Amvat called Naajhe-Loc.[[footnote]] &#34;The God&#39;s Scar,&#34; named as such because legend tells that, when the desert raped the Goddess, she struck him as he forced himself unto her. The result was a huge crevice in the god&#39;s power and domain, which became Naajhe-Loc. [[/footnote]]  Here, hidden from the rest of Amvat by a series of sharp, deformed rock formations, lies one of the planet&#39;s largest //Naaj-Kioo//. It flows from one of the fissure&#39;s walls in the form of a waterfall, creating a large lake at the bottom of it. Its moisture impregnates the walls and allows the growth of colossal plants, which would be nearly impossible anywhere else. The Silvarii have built their homes on these magnificent specimens, and their village spreads throughout the entire fissure. Viss-Mai is an intricate maze of homes of various sizes, founded directly on the trunks and branches of humongous trees, connected by wooden bridges. It is a lively place, filled with laughter and music.

The Silvarii do not farm or otherwise practice standard sedentary activities. Instead, they live directly from the earth, feeding on the fruits and vegetables provided to them by their environment. They also hunt for insects, which are an important part of their diet. Curiously, the Silvarii are one of the two peoples in Amvat who have access to fish and mollusks,[[footnote]] The other being the denizens of Akkeddam the Walled City. [[/footnote]]  which are considered a delicacy in their culture. To hunt these creatures, the Silvarii have become expert swimmers, divers and fishers, and move through water as if it were a second home to them.[[footnote]] Understandably, most //Amvatiaa// don&#39;t know how to swim. [[/footnote]]  

Viss-Mai is, unlike any other settlement on Amvat, completely protected from the violent, dusty winds of the desert. The rocky ridges surrounding the fissure form a barrier against most of the elements and even the extreme climatological changes seem to subside within the village. Granted, the denizens of Viss-Mai technically cheat, for their magic greatly enhances the fissure&#39;s defenses against the planet&#39;s wrath. 

This takes me to an important subject. The Silvarii cannot live without the plants found in Naajhe-Loc. These organisms are the source of the mana the Silvarii employ to hide and protect their village both against the elements and other Amvatiaa. Without them, the Silvarii are almost comically weak in terms of sorcery.[[footnote]] The Silvarii do not use wands, staffs, crystals or talismans to channel their natural magic abilities, and their individual auras are rather weak.  [[/footnote]]  Outside their home, they are virtually powerless against a cruel, inclement world. As such, the Silvarii rely entirely on the plants, and have formed a symbiotic relationship with them. In exchange for living space, nurture and mana, the Silvarii combat insect plagues and cut down any parasitic lifeforms that may infest the trees. They also worship the //Daa-Iv//, the Green Spirits, which are the tutelar deities of Naajhe-Loc,[[footnote]] While similar in name and function, these minor deities hold no relation to the Green Man.   [[/footnote]]  and make sacrifices to them.   

Being a paradise, Viss-Mai is regarded as something of a myth by the rest of the Amvatiaa.[[footnote]] This resembles how Shangri-La, Atlantis, [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3903 | Fata Morgana]]], the Martian civilizations and el Dorado were thought of as fictional after they hid themselves through both magic and technology. Unlike them, however, Viss-Mai has no interest in breaking its isolationism. – S.K.  [[/footnote]] [[footnote]] The Silvarii resemble an Amvatian analogue to the denizens of Hyperborea or the Aos Sí. In some myths, they are even elevated to the status of gods, like the Tuatha Dé Danann and the Fomorians. – S.K  [[/footnote]] Those few who stumble upon it are always welcome warmly by the Silvarii, as long as they come in peace. Most people choose to stay there and join the Silvarii, for obvious reasons. In fact, the few records of the village&#39;s existence come from those that attempted to conquer it and managed to escape alive. Emphasis must be made on &#34;escaping,&#34; because any would-be-conqueror will be lucky to leave the village in one piece. 

The Silvarii, despite not possessing advanced combat magic, are virtually invincible in their home. Their magic allows them to manipulate plant-life to a devastating effect. With a few spells and rituals, they can turn their method of subsistence into a deathtrap. On top of that, the Silvarii are expert healers, which means they also know the opposite science: poisons. Silvarii arrowheads and melee weapons are coated in a wide variety of toxins, both magic and mundane, whose effects go from instant necrosis to the slow, painful growth of carnivorous plant-life within the victim&#39;s body.     

The Silvarii are, thus, both the warmest hosts and the fiercest enemies one could find on Amvat. Their village and way of life, hidden away from prying eyes, will probably continue to be a mythical paradise to the rest of Amvat, the stuff of legend and awe amongst even the most skeptic Amvatiaa.
