Hi! I&#39;m Korben600. You probably know me as &#34;That guy who never posts anything&#34; or &#34;Who?&#34; 

Anyway, if you&#39;re here, it&#39;s probably because you read some of my work, and enjoyed it enough to see more! --...or you want to leave a scathing review about my historical inaccuracies, of which there are many.--

Whatever reason you&#39;re here, I hope you enjoy my work! 

##transparent|Also if you&#39;re here from the SCPD discord, and are wondering &#34;Hey, doesn&#39;t he have more stuff than this?&#34;, that&#39;s because I create (And post onto discord) about 6 good ideas for every 1 I actually write. Let&#39;s just say I have a HELL of a writing backlog I&#39;ve been meaning to get to...##

[[tab SCPs]]
**[[[SCP-6091]]]:** It is World War 2. All is not quiet on the Eastern front. But it will be. 

[[collapsible show=&#34; ► A more informative summary&#34; hide=&#34; ▼ Close&#34;]]
A series of documents detailing clashes between the Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Your typical Obskuracorps story where Nazis meddle in things beyond their comprehension...only this time it&#39;s not from the Nazi perspective.

[[tab Tales]]
**[[[PSA Cognitohazards and You!]]]** You know Broken Masquerade? Where the world wakes up to the anomalous insanity around it? Have you heard about the &#34;Duck, and Cover!&#34; PSA&#39;s from the Cold War that heavily imply that a picnic blanket can shield you from the radioactive output of a nuclear detonation? 

Take a wild guess what we wrote here. :)

[[collapsible show=&#34; ► Author&#39;s Opinions&#34; hide=&#34; ▼ Close&#34;]]
Okay, all the things I write are fun, that&#39;s why I write them, but this one was REALLY fun. I just loved going to town on &#34;How would I make this as unsettling, but believable, as possible?&#34; 

Also, Jack Waltz&#39;s comment is 100% correct when he said &#34;Skippie do be looking kinda cute though.&#34;
[[/collapsible]]

**[[[The Generally Uncomfortable Laboratory Adolescents Group]]]:** The Foundation has, quite frankly, a disturbing number of teenagers in their care. A short story about some of them meeting. 

(Recommend reading [[[SCP-3009]]]/the accompanying tales, and [[[SCP-105]]]/Resurrection Hub if you want the full emotional heft of this)

[[collapsible show=&#34; ► Author&#39;s Opinions&#34; hide=&#34; ▼ Close&#34;]]
I 100% rushed this out because I wanted the &#34;author&#34; tag on the SCPD discord server. It&#39;s not bad enough that I entirely hate it, but I fully intend on doing a small rewrite at some point in the future.
