My first scip! This was a lot of fun (well, as fun as writing about 14,000 people dying tends to get), and starting out with such a large-scale anomaly was daunting but I think I pulled it off well enough. The idea of the Foundation causing such a large scale disaster, and subsequently trying to save face, is something that I still find fascinating and will definitely be revisiting in a future scip.

This is a short, sweet, and relatively simple one, but I’ve had a lot of people tell me they enjoyed it. At its core, it’s a ghost story involving apparitions in a nightclub, but with a dash of nostalgia and social commentary. Warning: this scip contains British.

An average workday at Site-67 is disrupted when Director (//of Records//) Scott Sully introduces a freshly-picked recruit from the UIU.

Meanwhile, strange messages appear on the computer of hapless Researcher Dave Poots. Is this merely another juvenile prank being played by his colleagues, or is something afoot that&#39;s more sinister entirely?

My first &#39;pataphysical format screw.

I really love the movie //Fargo//... so I wrote a scip about it! Possibly the only article on the site in which a Mobile Task Force gets harassed by incorporeal Steve Buscemi.

Not sure what to say about this one other than I had a blast writing it! Trucks with a mind of their own, human goo, and a mechanical worm that hates capitalism all feature in this tale of vehicular vengeance in the Pacific Northwest.

Oh, and there’s a Lemon Demon reference snuck in for good measure.

I see this one as the spiritual successor to 5797. It&#39;s a similarly wacky concept, with a hefty helping of skin-peeling body horror and piss-taking of American conservatives. Fun to write, and - according to several - fun to read!

Short, simple, and with predominantly humorous intentions, this was one of those ideas which just came to me spontaneously, and I&#39;m quite pleased with the way it turned out.

Not much to say about this one at the moment, really, but I want a commentary section for consistency&#39;s sake. Yes, that&#39;s a Talking Heads reference in the title. //Honestly, I really don&#39;t like this one and I may delete it at some point.//

Hello! I’m Auto (he/him) and I’m fairly new to the SCP wiki; I’ve read them on and off for a couple of years, but only recently did I //really// fall down the rabbit hole and start writing some myself.

I like my scips short and sweet, with an eye for good dialogue and fun set-pieces. Thematically I enjoy articles which deal with sociopolitical themes and/or in-universe logistics pertaining to the Foundation.

Anomaly-wise, I think I&#39;d like to work more with cognitohazards in the future - I find them delightfully frightening and intriguing to deal with. 

If I had to pick two writers who influence me, I&#39;d go with Philip K Dick and William Gibson (//Burning Chrome// is my bible!)


**Other things:**
- I don’t tend to log into Wikidot unless I need to post something or use the sandbox, but I’m almost always reachable on Discord (@Automaton#5480) if you ever want to ask me anything.
- Always up for crit with a preference towards articles. I have yet to delve into the world of tales so I&#39;m not sure how valuable my advice would be there haha
