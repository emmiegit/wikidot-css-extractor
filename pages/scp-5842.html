**Description:** SCP-5842 is a standard North American stop sign. SCP-5842&#39;s primary anomalous property is appearing in a location via unknown means[[footnote]]Due to the similarities between SCP-5842 and [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1047 | SCP-1047]]], an investigation is underway to find a connection between them.[[/footnote]]. Initially, it was believed that SCP-5842 appeared at random, however, further research has discerned a pattern in its appearances. See addenda below.

**Wilma:** oh yea srry i completely forgot to call u. i passed right out when i got home!

**Lisa:** Wait, you managed to get home? But your car is still here! 

**Wilma:** i walked home. 

**Lisa:** From the office?! 

**Wilma:** yea. y is that so weird? 

**Lisa:** All 12 miles?!

**Wilma:** yea. 

**Lisa:** Jesus, Wilma, how long did that take?! 

**Wilma:** 5 hours.

**Lisa:** You left your car at work and walked for 5 hours until you got home?! 

**Wilma:** yea. i couldnt drive my car. 

**Lisa:** Well, if your car wasn&#39;t working, you could have just asked one of us to drive you! 

**Wilma:** its not that it wasnt working. there was a stop sign in my car, so i did what it told me and i stopped using that car. 

**Lisa:** Excuse me? 

**Wilma:** there was a stop sign in my car. ur supposed to stop at a stop sign, right? 

**Lisa:** ...Wilma. I get off in an hour. Come out of the house. I&#39;ll take you somewhere. Come on. My treat.

**Wilma:** sorry. cant.

**Lisa:** Don&#39;t worry about the price. I&#39;ll take you somewhere, anywhere. It can be a big fancy restaurant, you know? Or a walk in the park. I just want to be there for you, you know? 

**Wilma:** i cant leave the house. 

**Lisa:** Why not?? 

**Wilma:** theres a stop sign outside my window. so i cant go outside. 

**Lisa:** ...Wilma, I&#39;m gonna call you. 

//&lt;Lisa tries to call Wilma. It gets rejected.&gt;// 

**Wilma:** stop i cant make phone calls either. 

**Lisa:** Come on, dear, just talk to me. You&#39;ve been working yourself to death. Why can&#39;t you answer the phone anyways? 

**Wilma:** i cant answer the phone because the stop sign told me not to. 

**Lisa:** ??? 

**Wilma:** i went for a cup of coffee at the office and then i heard the customer phone ring. when i went there to answer it, there was a stop sign in my cubicle. 

**Lisa:** IN your cubicle? Wait, is that why you left work?? 

**Wilma:** yea. tbh i think its haunting me. 

**Lisa:** Haunting?? But that junk&#39;s not even real! 

**Wilma:** well thats what i thought too until it started following me. oh well. 

**Lisa:** Wilma. I&#39;m signing this 30 day off slip. I&#39;ll need your signature, okay? 

**Wilma:** only if u come here. 

**Lisa:** That&#39;s fine. 

**Wilma:** actually nvm dont come here.

**Lisa:** Why? 

**Wilma:** its at my front door now. no visitors. 

**Lisa:** Wilma!

**Lisa:** Thomas? Wilma, does William know yet? 

**Wilma:** no. i&#39;ll tell him after his birthday. 

**Lisa:** Okay. Well. I&#39;m still coming, okay?

**Second Encounter:**


SCP-5842 made an appearance in the morgue of Tillman Funeral Home and Crematory. The following is a letter of resignation by Craig Dillard, an employee of Tillman Funeral Home.

&gt; Dear Johnny Truman. 
&gt; This is my official letter of resignation. As you know, I am a very devout and pious follower of the Christian faith. For the longest time, I thought I was doing a good job, handling the bodies of the deceased and preparing them for burials. I had always believed that taking on a job such as this was good for my soul. 
&gt; 
&gt; I thought that if I helped my fellow men and women see off their loved ones as they departed to the gilded gates of our glorious God, that I&#39;d be recognized as virtuous. 
&gt; But sadly, that is not the case. I have received a sign from our Lord and Heavenly Father that I must stop what I have dedicated my career to. 
&gt; 
&gt; I was working on the body of an emissary of traffic when I turned around and saw the sign from God right then and there, peering down upon my work in the midst of me checking on the body&#39;s decomposition. In his life, this man directed the automobiles on the road. In death, he—ergo, God—has directed the vehicle of my life choices. 
&gt; 
&gt; I must leave this occupation. 
&gt; 
&gt; If God himself gave me this sign, I must heed it. Thank you for everything, Johnny. 
&gt; I wish you the best,
&gt; Craig Dillard



**Third Encounter:**


SCP-5842 was spotted in Wellington Elementary School. There was a writing assignment that had the students introduce themselves and describe something of interest that they had seen. 

One of the students described their experience of being followed by SCP-5842, transcribed below. Spelling and grammar errors are preserved from the original document.

**Fourth Encounter:**
SCP-5842 was found placed at an intersection that forced a male civilian to stop in front of an oncoming vehicle.

&gt; **Incident Date:** 9/30/2019 
&gt; 
&gt; **Summary:** SCP-5842 was seen in the driveway of a civilian identified as Frank Smith. As Frank Smith was pulling out of his driveway, SCP-5842 appeared behind his car and dented his rear bumper. SCP-5842 vanished immediately afterwards.

&gt; 
&gt; **Summary:** Frank Smith awakened in the middle of the night to SCP-5842 standing over him while he was asleep in bed. Neighbors reported seeing him run out of his home and screaming, &#34;leave me alone! Please! I didn&#39;t mean to!&#34;

&gt;
