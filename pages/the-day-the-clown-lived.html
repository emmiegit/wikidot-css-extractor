Gyaros, 1200-1000 BCE. A cold evening on a battlefield soaked in viscera and Greek fire. Gigantic metal statues walk toward a temple of flesh.

In the deepest subterranean reaches of the temple, Sarkic thaumaturges prepare a vein-covered pod of combat-grade vermin. The creatures within the pod tear at each other&#39;s throats. &#34;Under the right conditions,&#34;  Karcist Nal had promised years ago, &#34;this pod could turn an entire continent to ash and maggot-fodder.&#34; 

The pod is given to one of many Orin thralls - [[[scp-2416|Iose]]] the Pike-Bearer. &#34;Take this to be deployed on the surface,&#34; commands Võlutaar Dazh. &#34;Be careful. It&#39;s very fragile.&#34;

&#34;I obey,&#34; says Iose, taking the pod in his hands.

Iose trips.

March 15th, 44 BCE. Gaius Julius Caesar, dictator of Rome, finds himself increasingly paranoid of the Senate. He fears a plot on his life, and decides to cancel his scheduled appearance. 

Perhaps they know of the arcane text he had secured from the Daevite ruins. He couldn&#39;t die now, just days before the ascension ritual had been completed - before Caesar&#39;s glory could outshine Jupiter himself. 

Reclining in his private garden, the dictator spots his least favorite slave, [[[scp-2416|Josephus]]], cleaning the fountain and the surrounding stonework. Josephus catches sight of a spider and bolts away from his work. He slips on the wet pavement. The back of his head lands on the fountain with a sickening crunching noise. The fountain&#39;s water turns reddish-brown. A handful of flies, as if on cue, begin to surround the fountain.

Caesar cringes. //Perhaps I will go to the Senate today//, he says to himself, //if only to get away from this disgusting scene.//

May 3rd, 1937. Adolf Hitler orders a massive weapon to be deployed to America using the cover of a passenger airship. The Marshall, Carter, and Dark representative had boasted of its destructive potential for hours on end to the strapping young führer, but they had him at &#34;millions within the first five minutes of activation.&#34;

May 6th, 1937. As the airship is lowered into New Jersey, a technician named [[[scp-2416|Josef]]] begins to feel cold. Using his uneaten rations and a blowtorch, he builds a makeshift campfire next to a large supply of hydrogen.

November 5th, 1980. The //Svyatogor//, a Golf-class ballistic submarine under the Indian Ocean, receives the command from Moscow. The man in the Kremlin emphasizes that this isn&#39;t a drill. The captain draws a long sigh as he unpockets his launch key. //I suppose it was only a matter of time,// he says to himself.

At the same time: [[[scp-2416|Iosif]]], Petty Officer Second Class, realizes he left his aspirin in Novgorod. &#34;I&#39;ll be back in just a second,&#34; he says, as he opens a heavy doorway on the upper deck. 

The //Svyatogor// remains on the sea floor to this day.

March 15th, 2006. The Village Pointe Mall in Omaha welcomes President George W. Bush for the debut of a new Iraq War memorial.

Mitch Stevens, 53, &#34;Aryan-American,&#34; pats the worn copy of //The Turner Diaries// in his pocket as he watches the crowd from the parking lot. To him, Bush had done a lot of work to advance white supremacy. But he hadn&#39;t done //enough.// 

His baggy jeans jacket, the one from before his time in San Quentin, hides a vest of homemade explosives and rusty nails. As the President comes to the stage, Mitch breaks into a run--

And trips.

As he pries his face from the asphalt, Mitch can hear a drunken, high-pitched laugh from a man behind him. &#34;Dude, check your shoelaces,&#34; says the man, his voice slurred from alcohol. 

Mitch flies into a blind rage as he draws the bowie knife from his boot. At the end of the day, Mitch only kills one person - some homeless jagoff named [[[scp-2416|Joe Grunderson-Pike]]] - before he&#39;s arrested.

April 23rd, 2018. A Global Occult Coalition barge in the Southern Atlantic ocean carries out its shipment of esoteric military chemicals - particularly Substance-Tango-491, called &#34;Ambien From Hell&#34; by its nihilistic inventor - to Argentina without incident. 

[[[scp-2416|Corporal Joseph &#34;Big Joe&#34; Pike]]] is nowhere near the Substance-Charlie-499 tank to light a cigarette. 

The Substance-Charlie-499 tank doesn&#39;t go up in flames. 

The Substance-Tango-491 tank doesn&#39;t leak into the ocean. 

[[[scp-169|The Leviathan]]] does not ingest enough Substance-Tango-491 to keep it sleeping a while longer.

Joe, &#34;SCP-2416-21,&#34; is in Foundation Site-59, under a medically-induced coma. 

------

May 5th, 2049. The Leviathan awakens.

When the tidal wave hits Site-59, the failsafe dies in his sleep.
