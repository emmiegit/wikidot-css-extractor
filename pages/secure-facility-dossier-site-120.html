[[include component:image-block name=medium.jpg|align=right|caption=Site-120&#39;s aboveground area as seen from the banks of Warta.|width=300px]]

**Purpose:** Built atop [[[SCP-5292]]], Site-120 is the main hub of operations for the Department of Ontokinetics and its three sub-Departments -- the Divisions of Thaumaturgy, Theology, and Spatial Disruptions. As the oldest Site located within the boundaries of Poland, Site-120 is the primary unit of action during Poland-related activities and the main observation point for the [[[nexus-series|Free Port]]] of [[[SCP-5373|Esterberg]]].

**Founded:** 02/05/1916

**Location:** Abandoned industrial complex of Częstochowa, Poland

**Founding Director:** Hannah Rivera / Raia Micheals

**Cover Story:** Renovation and safe demolishing of abandoned industrial complexes within near proximity, radioactive waste disposal, cleaning of radioactively polluted areas of the Warta River nearby

**Size:** Aboveground Area of 34 km²

As one of the few Sites built almost entirely near anomalous spaces and not using D-Class personnel whatsoever, Site-120 is a rather odd Site when compared to the rest of the facilities operated by the Foundation. Initially built as a provisional outpost within SCP-5292 (at that time known as PL-X0R38/0124) for the [[[historia-polskiego-projektu-przechowawczego|Polish Containment Project]]], Site-120 quickly became a larger facility with the anomaly it was supposed to monitor actively becoming a part of the entire building.

One full cooperation agreement with SCP-5292-2 and a couple of decades later, Site-120 stands strong as, ironically, a bastion of relative weirdness within the Foundation -- being one of the few Sites actively encouraging the usage of thaumaturgy, hiring of anomalous personnel, and exploitation of anomalous technology, the facility has a reputation of being an &#34;anti-containment facility,&#34; sometimes incorporating the anomalous into its structure, systems, or staff, rather than containing it The shining example of this philosophy is [[[SCP-5672]]], which is actively used as a training grounds for its personnel rather than being closely monitored. Though this &#34;fighting fire with fire&#34; -- fire being here thaumaturgy, reality-bending, and anomalies -- has been initially looked down upon by the entire Foundation -- even following the implementation of [[[ralliston-s-proposal|Directive Alpha/1911]]] -- following the grand success of [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-43|Site-43]]]&#39;s [[[on-guard-43-hub|implementation of esoteric containment and classes into its containment plans]]], the dislike for Site-120&#39;s system has visibly decreased.

Being the hub for the entire Department of Ontokinetics, Site-120 is one of the few Sites that treat ontokinetics, thaumaturgy, and theology as real sciences with set rules, and not just anomalous influence. This approach, though dangerous at times -- with the most well-known incident being the unfortunate loss of Dr. Scranton, one of the lead ontokinetics researchers at Site-120 within [[[SCP-3001]]] -- has been noted to yield great results. Following Site-120&#39;s discovery and creation of numerous anti-ontokinetic and anti-thaumaturgic equipment and technology -- such as the Scranton Reality Anchors and Asheworth-Rivera Conduits and the [[[SCP-6172|entirety of the modern multiverse theory]]] -- numerous other Foundation departments are less than shy about using them.

Site-120&#39;s overall research has proven itself to be extremely useful to the Foundation at large -- after years of non-stop studying and translating of SCP-5292-1 instances, Site-120 came to possess the most extensive physical and digital library of information concerning everything it researches, with the amount of information concerning its three main specialties being a particular point of pride. In fact, over its numerous operation years, this database became so large that it needed to be digitized, with a necessity for a special digital keeper to look over, catalog, and further study all such files -- this task is accomplished by [[[SCP-6079|Ra.aic]]], Site-120&#39;s primary [[[aiad-homescreen|Artificially Intelligent Conscript]]].

&#34;Esterberg,&#34; &#34;Tysiąclecie Górne,&#34; &#34;Częstochowa&#39;s Free Port&#34; -- many names were given to FP-120, the anomalous city under Site-120&#39;s watching eye. Built entirely within a pocket dimension parallel to the city of Częstochowa, Esterberg is the main hub for all anomalous races and activities within the region, acting as a safe space without the danger of Foundation interference.

Due to numerous trust issues mainly caused by ideological differences and unpleasant prior interactions the Foundation-Esterberg relationship is most of the time less than ideal. Site-120&#39;s secondary objective is to fix this divide, as diplomatically as possible. To achieve this, the Foundation has been forced to cooperate with numerous [[[Groups of Interest]]] in the past. Though initially widely regarded as a bad idea, following the satisfying results given by the [[[the-gulf|Gulf Initiative]]] as well as the successful Foundation-GoI-571-20 (&#34;[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/pzga-hub Polish Anomalous Mushroom Picking Association]&#34;) that occurred during SCP-PL-252&#39;s discovery, the Foundation-Esterberg cooperation plans have started to receive more and more funding with each year of activity, with continually improving results.

+++ Aboveground
[[/=]]

Though not as impressive as the rest of the facility, Site-120&#39;s aboveground area is still a sight to behold -- transformed from an uninhabitable space left by the rapid industrialization of Częstochowa&#39;s nearby areas in the 19th century, it is now mainly occupied by an industrial complex seemingly bleeding into the newly planted green around. With a park, couple of animal habitats for animal anomalies the Site contains, riverbanks, and a small port located nearby, with each day the once toxic wasteland that was the area around Site-120 is being eliminated, giving into the newly found nature.

[[=]]
+++ Level 1
[[/=]]

The first and largest floor of Site-120 is where the day-to-day life happens; filled entirely with staff offices, RAISA archives, recreational areas, and the Site&#39;s cafeteria. Almost no anomalies are contained within this area -- with the only exception to this rule being a large portion of Site-120&#39;s staff.

[[=]]
+++ Level 2
[[/=]]

The second floor is where the actual research and containment happen. With highly equipped laboratories and research areas, containment cells -- even if a rarity -- and servers overlooked by Ra.aic, Level 2 is the main workspace for the entirety of the Site.

[[=]]
+++ Level 3
[[/=]]

Being entirely occupied by SCP-5292 and the library it offers, Level 3 is a relatively strange space -- occupied by both translation offices led by Dr. Alistair Vemhoff and reading areas available to all staff for free access, the dimly-lit halls of Site-120&#39;s Grand Library are never devoid of life.

[[=]]
+++ Level 4
[[/=]]

Located underneath a reinforced barrier dividing the maintenance spaces of Site-120 and SCP-5292, Level 4 houses most of the electrical apparatus that keeps the Site running. Being a maze filled with numerous dark hallways and long corridors, the technical space is one of the more interesting places Site-120 has to offer -- especially its plumbing system, with a sewage cleaning apparatus releasing purified water directly into the waters of Warta, which was built relatively early in the Site&#39;s development and thus remains a place filled with much weirdness -- sometimes more literally than one would expect.

[[=]]
+++ Level 5
[[/=]]

Only available to Clearance Level 4+ personnel, Level 5 is by far the most ominous and secretive place within Site-120. With a Deepwell Archive and a small area acting as a total exclusionary zone, it is the final front of defense for personnel and information likewise. How many times it actually needed to be used though remains unknown.

A three-man squad of ursinology experts trained in field operations focused entirely on making sure [[[SCP-5464]]]&#39;s actions remain not interfered with, with their secondary objective being ensuring the anomaly&#39;s well being. These actions range from complex field operations through making sure its specialized habitat near Site-120&#39;s park remains in a good shape to simply taking it for a walk around said park on a regular basis.

**Mobile Task Force Theta-120 (&#34;Tyrfing Black&#34;)**

A three-man Mobile Task Force consisting of the main research group of the [[[and-every-time-we-meet-again-hub|The Damien Nowak case]]]; despite their relatively high rankings within the Foundation -- these being the Site Director statuses of Jessie Rivera and Daniel Asheworth and the Chief of Security status of Jeremy Cornwell -- the team was decided to be a valuable field resource due to their high knowledge of PoI-5936. Currently existing only on paper with no responsibilities due to the PoI-5936 case being long-closed.

**01/04/2021**

The first of April, 2021 was a relatively hard time for Site-120 -- falling victim to both a [[[049-x-minion-x-reader|reality collision]]] as well as a [[[danimals|sudden turning of one of the Director Council members into an ape]]], the chaos that ensued was one the Foundation had to deal with for more than it wanted to.

**15/02/2030**

[[[SCP-6172]]]; During the final test of SCP-6172 and the dissolution of the SCP Foundation, a fatal error occurred, stranding numerous vital Site-120 and Department of Ontokinetics personnel across the multiverse, which in turn forced the remaining staff to attempt to initiate any way possible to bring them back. Further details regarding the incident are available in [[[chronicles-of-the-irreal-hub|Project Hermes casefiles]]].
