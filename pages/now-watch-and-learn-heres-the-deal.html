&gt; From: Lisle Naismith [lnaismith@foundation.scp]
&gt; To: Overseer Council
&gt; Subject: Isaiah Henderson
&gt; 
&gt; My colleague (and friend) Dr. Henderson has been exposed to a FAFNIR-type infohazard at Site-59. The effects will be dormant for the next 72 hours, but their severity warrants his termination prior to the &#34;rage state&#34; event. Rather than the standard protocol, he has requested to be killed by [[[SCP-173]]].
&gt; 
&gt; Consider this my request for permission. I can say with certainty that he always had a particular fascination with 173. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Dr. Naismith

&gt; //Permission granted. This is an unusual request, but after 37 years of his loyal service, it&#39;s only fair. Take at least three D-class with you to maintain the line of sight, internally or externally, as you see fit.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Please understand that the Overseer Council will hold you personally accountable for any breach incidents that may come of this.// - O5-11

Just outside SCP-173&#39;s bulkhead, Dr. Henderson held a cardboard box in his sweaty hands.

&#34;Are you sure you&#39;re ready?&#34; said Dr. Naismith.

&#34;No,&#34; said Henderson with a chuckle. &#34;But no one //is// ready for this type of thing. Like when I was going to the dentist as a kid. My mom had a saying for it.&#34;

&#34;What&#39;s that?&#34;

&#34;She told me that I had to let my brain do the worrying, while the feet did something else entirely.&#34;

Naismith grinned. &#34;Sounds like courage in a nutshell.&#34;

The four D-class behind Naismith rolled their eyes. 

&#34;Just one question,&#34; said Naismith, indicating the cardboard box. &#34;Why //those?&#34;//

&#34;It&#39;s something I&#39;ve always wondered, Lisle. The answer seems obvious, but scientists don&#39;t deal in seems-obviouses.&#34; 

The fifth D-class, D-42749 next to Henderson, just barely stifled an //&#34;It&#39;s been 15 minutes, jerkass, just let him in or marry him already!&#34;//

Naismith patted Henderson on the shoulder. &#34;Godspeed, Isaiah.&#34;

&#34;You too. Now, if you would be so kind...&#34;

Naismith threw a switch at the side of the room. &#34;Opening the bulkhead. Maintain direct eye contact with the object at all times.&#34; A buzzer sounded, and the locking mechanisms of the bulkhead clicked and whirred.

&#34;Fucking //finally,&#34;// said D-42749.

-----

Once the door was locked behind them, D-42749 and Dr. Henderson found themselves face-to-face with the good ol&#39; concrete-and-rebar god of destruction itself. Due to a recent cleaning operation, the floor was mercifully white for a change.

Dr. Henderson sighed, and tightened his grip on the box. &#34;Excuse me, 42749, would you do me a quick favor?&#34;

D-42749 grunted.

&#34;Close your eyes. Give your eyelids a rest.&#34;

&#34;Dr. Naismith said to--&#34;

&#34;Only one person has to do it, and I&#39;m a seasoned staring contest professional. Are they closed?&#34;

&#34;Yeah.&#34;

Taking in a long, deep breath, Henderson decided to get it over with. He blinked...

...just after he overturned a box of old banana peels at 173&#39;s feet.

++ //CLANG!//

In a fraction of a second, Henderson&#39;s eyes opened, and SCP-173 was face-down on the floor on the other side of the cell. D-42749 let out a scream. He never stopped screaming.

&#34;Now I can die in peace,&#34; said Henderson, closing his eyes. 

The last thing he felt was a slab of concrete bitch-slapping him 27 times.
