I&#39;m not really sure how I wound up in the water. The rush of currents and crunch of impact after impact as I was dragged along the rocks by the merciless current drove everything else from my mind. Thinking back, I don&#39;t remember how I wound up in that particular section of rapids at all, much less how I was separated from my kayak.

The thing no one really tells you about whitewater currents is how loud they are. Even as I was dragged along, bouncing from rock to rock like some strange sad cross between a pinball and a pinata, I managed to marvel at the rush and roar of the water all around me. For some reason, I&#39;d always expected drowning to be silent.

Forgive the cliche, but what must have been seconds felt like an eternity. I distinctly remember having time to regret having worn my nice watch as it shattered against the stones, and to wonder how I was going to replace it. I spent what felt like hours careening down the rapids, until a particularly hard boulder impacted my head and time stopped entirely.

When I woke up, I was lying in a few inches of water in absolute darkness.

I sat up, rubbing my bleeding head, and fumbled in my pocket for the box of waterproof matches I always carried on my outdoorsy excursions. Incredibly, the current hadn&#39;t managed to tear them away from me. Hands shaking, I managed to open the box and extract a match. I struck it.

Before my eyes could adjust to the glare, it was extinguished.

&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;

The voice was hoarse and soft, like a tenor with a terrible cold. 

&#34;Fire uses oxygen. We&#39;ve got a limited supply of that. Welcome to hell.&#34;

Later, I learned that my companion in the darkness was a fellow lost kayaker who&#39;d been washed down into the same underwater cave some time before. He wouldn&#39;t tell me what he&#39;d had to eat beyond &#34;I ran out.&#34;, and something in his voice told me I didn&#39;t want to know. Navigating the cave by feel, I&#39;d come across the remains of a two man canoe.

He&#39;d been digging for a while. With a grunt, I joined him. The tunnel was narrow but long, stretching mostly upward except for where it had to curve below a particularly tenacious boulder or seam. &#34;Three more days, I think.&#34; he told me, in one of the rare moments we spoke. &#34;Think you can hold out that long?&#34; And he laughed, then, for a long time.

So we dug. Without a watch, I had no way to tell how much time was passing, but his guess was more or less correct. Eventually, he paused. &#34;I&#39;m going to go, er... yeah. I&#39;ll be back.&#34;

He dragged himself back down the tunnel without another word. A few seconds later, I burst through topsoil into light.

Blinded by the glare, I lay there for a few minutes, soaking up the warmth and light, before realizing I could hear no sound of my companion. I called out, but heard no answer. So I widened the hole, letting light down into the tunnel, and farther into the cave. Silence was the only answer.

I clambered down the tunnel, surprisingly short in the daylight, and looked around the cave. There, in the corner, next to the crushed canoe and a pile of gnawed human bones, lay a dessicated corpse, months dead, with a shovel in its hand.

I ran. When rescuers found me, lost and gibbering in the woods, it had been four days since I went missing.</textarea></pre>
