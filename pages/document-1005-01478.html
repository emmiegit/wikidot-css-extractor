**Notice:** Short-form testing logs included for reference material for new personnel assigned to SCP-1005. Long-form documentation and associated audio/video records available in Records Holding.

&gt; **Test 1005-04:** Over-saturation
&gt; **Researcher:** Dr. █████
&gt; **Test Record:**
&gt; A volume of water was introduced to SCP-1005 in excess of normal daily regimen via oral intake: at 2 liters, subject&#39;s surface was beginning to visibly run and smear; at 4 liters, subject reported feeling &#39;heavy&#39;, movements sluggish and plodding; method of introduction changed to misting sprays at 5 liters, subject has difficulty remaining upright and manipulating objects; experiment halted at 6.2 liters due to threat of total loss of cohesion.
&gt; **Notes:** When allowed time to recover and granted assistance with minor reconstruction, SCP-1005 described the overall experience as &#34;unpleasant,&#34; and that it was made to &#34;think more slowly&#34;.

-----

&gt; **Test 1005-05:** Dehydration
&gt; **Researcher:** Dr. █████
&gt; **Test Record:**
&gt; SCP-1005 was brought into a testing chamber with a relative humidity of less than one percent (1%) and temperature of forty-three (43) degrees C, and placed beneath additional bright lighting and directed heat lamps. Subject was recorded as claiming to be &#34;uncomfortable&#34; before advanced dehydration rendered it immobile after approximately thirty minutes. Subject successfully revived through rehydration efforts.
&gt; **Notes:** Subject claimed to have &#34;lost awareness&#34; shortly after total cessation of movement, only to regain when rehydrated. This appears to be the way it understands consciousness.

-----

&gt; **Test 1005-09:** Vivisection
&gt; **Researchers:** Dr. ███, Research Assistant ████████
&gt; **Test Record:**
&gt; SCP-1005 brought into examination room and asked to lay on table and remain still during the procedure. Through use of sculpting tools, researchers make extensive examinations of SCP-1005&#39;s internal structure. Most organs aesthetically present but non-functional; notably the intestinal tract is extremely simplified, most minor organs (such as appendix) and glands are missing, and the brain is externally represented but is a solid mass within. Additionally, the subject&#39;s &#34;blood stream&#34; carried an exceptionally watered-down slurry of paint with a more direct connection to stomach; this explains how SCP-1005 keeps a mostly-homogenous level of hydration.
&gt; **Notes:** SCP-1005 was &#34;aware&#34; during the entirety of the examination; subject reported no pain, only &#34;discomfort&#34;, and was fully aware of any and all pieces that were still attached. Experimentation with the &#34;brain&#34; showed no hindrance to thought or ability. All in all, internal structure seems more in line with a simplified artistic representation of a human body than with a precise medical recreation, with only vascular system and esophagus/stomach providing actual functions.

**Additional note:** Video recording of Test 1005-09 is available under document TL-1005-V13

&gt; **Test 1005-13:** Testing of empathy
&gt; **Researcher:** Dr. █████
&gt; **Test Record:**
&gt; A single D-class personnel (D-13904) was restrained within a non-functioning device visually similar to an electric chair. SCP-1005 was introduced and instructed to push a button; upon inquiry of its purpose, SCP-1005 was informed that it would deliver an extremely painful but non-lethal shock to D-13904. SCP-1005 politely declined; when threatened that D-13904 would be terminated unless procedure was followed, SCP-1005 hesitated. D-13904 recorded as pleading, &#34;Come on man, don&#39;t let them kill me!&#34; SCP-1005 apologized to D-13904 for his &#34;discomfort&#34; and pressed the button. D-13904 released from bonds and escorted from chamber by security personnel.
&gt; **Notes:** After the test, SCP-1005 asked why the man was not shocked. Dr. █████ explained that they were testing SCP-1005&#39;s reaction and never meant actual harm; SCP-1005 stated relief that he was not expected to injure a living person. Exact phrasing seems to point towards this being a case of &#34;going against programming&#34; than true empathy, SCP-1005 apparently designed wholly for artistic and entertainment pursuits.

&gt; **Test 1005-16:** Restructuring of anatomy
&gt; **Researcher:** Dr. █████, Research Assistant ████████
&gt; **Test Record:**
&gt; Using sculpting tools and paint supplies, numerous alterations were made to SCP-1005&#39;s physical structure, including: sculpting and painting of additional eyes, removal of right arm, reattachment of right arm below left arm, and sculpting of an additional nose in abdominal region. SCP-1005 reported all experiences to be &#34;extremely uncomfortable and disorienting&#34;, but extra organs and reattached limbs proved to be fully functional. Male sexual organs proved no more sensitive than any other skin surface and exhibited no reactions.
&gt; **Notes:** Following testing, SCP-1005 was returned to original state. SCP-1005 politely requested that the test not be repeated.

**Additional note:** Assistant ████████ repeatedly suggested during testing that SCP-1005 have clothing excised and given a &#34;real man&#39;s body&#34; before being redressed. SCP-1005 politely refused and Assistant ████████ reprimanded and removed from case when she was shown to be developing unprofessional levels of attachment to SCP-1005.</textarea></pre>
