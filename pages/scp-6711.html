**Special Containment Procedures:** A .25 kilometer perimeter consisting of a 3 meter tall fence around the entity is established, monitored and maintained. The area within this perimeter, SCP-6711-Δ, shall be inaccessible without express permission by the designated authority on the entity. All instances of SCP-6711-A shall be recorded and aggregated on a --monthly-- --yearly-- --decades-- --centennial-- millennial basis to determine further exploration data. 

**Description:** SCP-6711-Δ is a designated area, situated to the northeast of the former Second Springs Hot Springs in the --defunct-- Ancient San Bernardino Land Preserve. The entity is defined as a spatial-temporal anomaly, approximately 3 meters in circumference located off the southern intersection of two unnamed access roads previously used by California State Rangers, as well as the former proprietors of said Second Springs Ranch. 

Individuals who pass through the boundary of the entity during the day will experience no ill-effect. However, for currently undefined reasons, individuals who pass through the anomalous region of the entity during nightfall will invariably find themselves in a larger, mostly unexplored space, akin to a large, arid desert, in which time dilations are prevalent. 

Within the parameters of current exploration, it can be determined that the further a subject travels into the entity, the slower time progresses for the subject relative to the time outside the entity’s boundaries. Current theories suggest that a temporal singularity exists a the center, at an indeterminable distance into the entity, where if the singularity reached, time outside the boundary would approach infinity.

Instances of SCP-6711-A are long-form wavelength transmissions from MTF Agent - “Coyote”.

**Discovery:** The entity came to Foundation attention when two civilians looking to participate in activities associated with Second Hot Springs were reported missing. Foundation Personnel embedded in the California Ranger Service, per Protocol Plainsight-201, were notified of the situation and sent to recover the lost individuals. All relevant documentation is contained henceforth.

**Samuel Lowenthal:** Jackson, thank you for your patience. How are you feeling?

**Subject-A:** I… I… uh… where am I? Where is Maria?

**Lowenthal:** I can’t share that information with you right now. 

**Subject-A:** What is this… place?

//Subject looks around. He looks disoriented.//

**Lowenthal:** You have been in contact with an unknown area of space-time, and are currently under quarantine observation.

**Subject-A:** Unknow… quaren…huh? Wait, how long will I be here? How long were…

**Lowenthal:** You were lost in the desert, correct?

**Subject-A:** I… we… yeah…

//Subject-A is distant and distracted.//

**Lowenthal:** How long were you lost?

**Subject-A:** We… uh... for the night? The sun didn&#39;t come up until...

**Lowenthal:** Jackson, according to telephone records we have, you made a call from Maria Schultz’s phone at 01:34am on Tuesday, May 9th. Yes?

**Subject-A:**I... Yeah, she wanted to keep trying to reload the map, but it wasn’t working. The phone was at 3%… So I took it from her and called 911... She didn&#39;t like that.

**Lowenthal:** Jackson, today is Thursday, the 18th. You&#39;ve been gone for 9 days.

**Subject-A:** I… no… can’t be. The sun never came up… it was only night. The moon stayed… All night.

**Lowenthal:** Jackson, can you tell me any details about what you saw while you were lost?

//24 seconds pass in silence.//

**Lowenthal:** Jackson?

//Subject-A remains silent.//

**O’Harrahan:** (//In earpiece.//) Sam, we’ll pick this up tomorrow?

**Lowenthal:** Yes ma’am. Any word on the female, Maria?

**Subject-A:** Huh?

**O’Harrahan:** (//In earpiece.//) No one has breached the containment area yet, Sam.

**Lowenthal:** Maybe tomorrow then.

**Lowenthal:** Good day, Jackson. How are you feeling today?

**Subject-A:** I’m… I’m still trying to understand. We were only lost for the night. It was cold. So I called…

**Lowenthal:** Yes, Jackson, do you remember anything strange about the call? Any thing at all?

**Subject-A:** No. The lady just asked what we looked like and what we were wearing, she sounded weird… I was upset.

**Lowenthal:** Why were you upset?

**Subject-A:** It was like she was pranking me…

**Lowenthal:** Jackson, could you take a listen to this?

//Reseacher Lowenthal takes out a recording device and plays its contents.//

//Begin Recording://

**Operator:** 911, what is your emergency?

//Subject-A’s voice can be heard speaking back to the operator, however his voice is pitched down, and much slower than typical speech patterns.//

**Subject-A (Recording):** We are lost near Second Springs. Send help.

**Operator:** Sir, I’m going to need you to speak clearer and tell me what you are wearing.

//The Operator’s voice is heard speeding up and sounding higher pitched.//

**Subject-A (Recording):** What I am wearing? We are lost! We are the only fucking people in bathing suits with a flashlight wandering the desert! Send…

//The line is terminated.//

**Operator:** Sir?

//End Recording.//

**Subject-A:** That wasn’t my voice, was it?

**Lowenthal:** It seems that you stumbled upon and into what we like to call a temporal anomaly. You are lucky we found you.

**Subject-A:**  I rememberer seeing a flashlight and the sun coming up in the distance, yet it was still night where Maria and I were. I ran towards it.

**Lowenthal:** Thats when we picked you up.

**Subject-A:** Yes, umm… how’s Maria?

**O’Harrahan:** (//In earpiece.//) I think we are done for today.

**Lowenthal:** We will talk tomorrow, Jackson.

**Lowenthal:** Morning Jackson, feeling better?

**Subject-A:** Yeah a bit. How is Maria? Its been a while… I know I’m in quarantine, but..

**Lowenthal:** I am sure she is fine. I want to ask you about the time you were lost two weeks ago.

**Subject-A:** You mean last nigh… Oh, yeah its all weird, huh?

**Lowenthal:** Yes, it is. Can you tell me about the night when you and Maria were lost?

**Subject-A:** Well, we were trying to make our way back to camp. Maria and I knew each other for a long time and I always had a thing for her ya know?

**Lowenthal:** Mmhmm.

**Subject-A:** Well, she was moving outta town, gonna start new and fresh, and I footed the bill. She wanted, like, one last adventure so she suggested the nudie springs. Thought it would be, like, my chance, you know?

**Lowenthal:** Mr. Kimble, I am more concerned about what happened just prior to your phone call attempt. Can you fast forward?

**Subject-A:** Oh, yeah sure, well like, we had done a bunch of blow and drank the entire day. As we were trying to find our way back we took a wrong turn down this old dirt path.

**Lowenthal:** A service road, yes?

**Subject-A:** I don’t know. We were trying to just follow this fence. When it stopped, I made the call. She thought we should try to head back towards the mountains, back to the springs.

**Lowenthal:** What happened when you left the path.

**Subject-A:** I dialed the phone as I followed her. Made the call, then after that we got in a fight. I didn’t want the night to end with her yelling at me like that. This was for her. I love her, ya know?

**Lowenthal:** I see, now, before you were picked up by the search and rescue team, could you tell me anything else?

**Subject-A:** I tried to keep us close to the road, every time we went too far out of sight of the road, we moved back. Then I noticed a flashlight waving in the distance, and far away the sun was rising. So, I ran to it. After that I was so tired, all I remember is sleeping and waking up here.

**Lowenthal:** Did you notice any strange creatures?

Francis,

My friend, I know it has been a long time. I hope retirement is treating you well. I am surprised I still find the work so fulfilling. Reaching seventy was something I never thought would occur given our line of work, and I can’t imagine how your later years must be treating you.

However, I must digress to the most pertinent matter. I got the strangest email from Richards. You remember right? The intern while we were at Delta? Well, it seems that our past has caught up with us. In respects to Delta, if you can recall, D-101488 and his counterpart, civilian Maria Schultz, Subject-B, have just reappeared post SCP-6711 boundary!

I do believe that given the time frame obtained from D-Class’s time piece, that a formal MTF expedition is warranted.

Please let me know your thoughts on this matter.

Always at your service,

Dir. Samuel Lowenthal

Samuel,

It is so good to hear from you. I am, to the best of my abilities, trying to enjoy retirement. My position as Site Director has surely taken a toll on me, as you probably now understand. I try to thrive to my best extent. These quiet years have allowed me much time to think and reflect on all that I have done in the name of Secure, Contain, and Protect. 

I hope Richards, as well as yourself is well.

As much as I believe an exploration into SCP-6711 would be beneficial, the possible ethical implications would be against my current philosophies regarding human treatment. 

All that being said, should you find a suitable, willing candidate for the mission, I, as the Project Lead on the anomaly, would give my endorsement.

With Reverence,

Former Dir. - Francis O’Harrahan

Mr. Bazarian, 

I am reaching out to you as I am in need of someone with your expertise. We have an anomaly that requires the finesse of a survivalist such as yourself. Your aptitude in previous missions as well as personal feats makes you the best and only candidate. Your K2 ascent and your leadership skills in recovery of SCP-████, certainly come to the forefront.

Mr. Lowenthal,

Thank you for reaching out. It’s been a rough time for me with the mass resettlement from Florida. Carolyn died a few months back and then I got diagnosed with an inoperable tumor... The shit list goes on and on. Times like this I wish dad was around. I know he wasn&#39;t the best Agent, but God to I want to do him proud. I wish they would let me see his last log...

What kind of mission parameters are we dealing with here?

Agent Bazarian,

I’m well aware of all the things life has thrown at you lately. I am truly sorry. To be up and front with you, this is the kind of mission you don’t come back from. Along with your professional experience, I also considered your personal affairs when choosing you as a prime candidate. Should you accept, I shall see to it that you have access to the SCP-████ File, detailing your father&#39;s last mission.

The anomaly itself displaces subjects inside by years in the future. We had a D-Class in there for a little over 15 minutes his time, while more than 2 decades passed for us. This could be your chance to start over.

Caleb, this might be your chance to do something amazing. Make your dad proud.

All the Foundation needs is your cooperation.

Let me know your thoughts,

I am doing my best to stay in a straight line, that way getting back, when the time comes, should be easier. Despite being a moonless night when entering, the space is illuminated by a full moon. It makes seeing easier. The terrain here is pretty uniform, a few large jutting rock faces every half kilometer or so. Very devoid of vegetation. The most common vegetation is the occasional Joshua Tree as well as some tumble weeds. Animal life, if it does live in here is extremely sparse. ||

|| Agent Coyote, this is Project Lead on SCP-6711, Site-Delta Director, Trank Webber, the year is 2136. The world outside is still very much recognizable. We have updated your transmissions to “SCP-6711-A”. We will be able to respond to you for only a short time more, as sending these long wave frequency transmissions can only reach a finite limit. We will advise when communication is no longer viable. For now, it was nice to speak with you, if only one way. I want you to know you’re kind of a legend around here. Godspeed. ||

With the merging of many, what you would call G-O-I’s, the GOC, and the Foundation into the &#34;Foundation of Greater Earth&#34;. We seek to only contain Thaumiel entities and those entities that may provide Thaumiel status. Fortunately, SCP-6711 has been deemed as such and you may continue to exist within it. This will be our last transmission as we can no longer physically produce lower wavelength frequencies into SCP-6711. We have built a native code within the Foundation Database called “Coyote Ugly” that will ensure that no matter when you are, your voice is heard. You are on your own now. Godspeed. ||

It seems the tension on my tether cord was overwhelmed.. I was just starting the descent from the rock face when this happened. I managed to catch myself on my 3rd belay bolt, about 25 feet down, however the overhang provided just enough arch length for me to slam much harder than expected into the face.

Given that even just post-boundary, time progresses at least at twice, if not three times more than pre-boundary, I guess so much time has passed that my tether cord deteriorated and snapped. Hell, how long have I been here? How long does it take for a kevlar support to break down?
