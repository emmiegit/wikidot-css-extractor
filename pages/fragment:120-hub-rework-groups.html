The Foundation isn&#39;t the only player behind and beyond the Veil; the paranormal and baseline worlds are chock-full of other organizations that also play their part in this grand story. Below you can find a full list of all groups actively featured in the canon, alongside an explanation of who they are and what they do; if a group isn&#39;t an original creation of F120A, but is rather &#34;imported&#34; from the GoI Hub, it is also featured below, alongside their differences from their &#34;baseline&#34; interpretations.

*  **Research and Containment Team Δt** -- also called RCT-Δt or simply Delta-T; a multiverse-protecting force originating from the SCP Foundation&#39;s Temporal Anomalies Department. Eventually split off from the organization due to the nature of its mission and the fact its operations were technically outside of the Foundation&#39;s hierarchy of administration. Consists of almost all multiversal iterations of the original Department, banded together under the common mission of [[[multiverse-threat-recovery-log-scp-6936|mitigating damage to timelines and the multiverse at large]]] and maintenance of [[[scp-5618|1981 Multi-Foundation Coalition Pact]]]. Each iteration is run by either Dr. Ilse Reynders or Dr. Thaddeus Xyank, depending on the originating timeline.

* **The Global Occult Coalition** -- a semi-authoritarian &#34;government&#34; of the paranormal world that deals with anomalous phenomena on behalf of the United Nations and is directly responsible to its Security Council. Formed from an alliance of 108 occult organizations from around the globe that banded together under the banner of the Allied Occult Initiative during the Seventh Occult War to fight back against Obskurakorps, the occult branch of the Third Reich. Following the conclusion of the conflict, the organization reformed into what is now known as the GOC, and has continued operation ever since. _
 _
The Coalition&#39;s primary role is the protection of the human race [[[scp-6772|from]]] [[[scp-pl-259|emerging]]] [[[the-first-occult-flame-war|parathreats]]], resorting to liquidation as its main operational strategy. Its secondary objective is acting as the de-facto &#34;government&#34; of the paranormal world, passing laws that regulate the usage of certain aspects of magic, paratechnology, and other anomalies around the globe. Although with good intentions, most of the time, the Coalition&#39;s actions end in either [[[lte-1998-burnout-blaecca-parallax|overreach]]], [[[art:public-release-of-operation-witness-materials|overreaction]]], or outright abuse, caused by its inability to recognize anyone but itself as an authority in the field of protecting humanity. _
 _
The Coalition consists of three primary bodies: High Command, the International Court For the Paranormal, and the Council of 108.
 * **High Command** -- the executive branch of the Global Occult Coalition. Manages all internal administration and oversees the operation of all other parts of the group. Ran by the Office of the Undersecretary General, the primary force behind most of the Coalition&#39;s operations; position currently held by an individual known as D.C. al Fine.
  * **PHYSICS Division** -- the GOC&#39;s military arm, responsible for combat and military operations on behalf of the Coalition, carried out by Assessment Teams and Strike Teams.
  * **PSYCHE Division** -- the GOC&#39;s diplomatic arm, responsible for the Coalition&#39;s internal and external relations, consisting of diplomats and agents monitoring the world for new parathreats.
  * **PTOLEMY Division** -- the GOC&#39;s support arm, responsible for logistics, equipment development and production, and coordinating research projects among the Council of 108 members.
 * **The International Court For the Paranormal** -- the judicial branch of the Global Occult Coalition. Manages all major international paralaw-related cases within the anomalous community in accordance with its International Paralaw Codex. One of its most known cases was handling the 1985 Esterberg / SCP Foundation lawsuit, wherein the latter stood accused of causing the [[[scp-5373|inadvertent destruction of over a 1/5th of the Free Port]]] and violating international agreements.
 * **The Council of 108** -- the legislative branch of the Global Occult Coalition. Manages the creation and edition of laws governing the paranormal communities worldwide via democratic votes and discussions. Consists of 108 occult member groups that act as the driving force behind the operations of the Coalition, with each group oftentimes having widely different opinions and visions about the direction of these operations. Its members include:
  * **Bauhaus^^4^^** -- the fourth and final iteration of the Bauhaus architecture art school, opened after the conclusion of the Seventh Occult War under the protection of the Global Occult Coalition following the closing of the school&#39;s three former locations by Nazi Germany. Founded by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and other former Bauhaus teachers in secret, Bauhaus^^4^^ focuses on developing modern architecture styles that include non-Euclidean properties, utilizing them for the benefit of its clients and the citizens of anomalous cities.
  * **The Bavarian Illuminati** -- a parapolitical organization originally founded in 1776, during [[[poczatki-normalnosci-i-jej-przyszlosc|paranormal renaissance after the Fifth Occult War]]]. With the stated mission of &#34;the advancement of the human race and its welfare,&#34; which the Illuminati believes is best done in secret. Despite these bold claims, however, the group is mostly a [http://scp-pl.wikidot.com/iluminaci-krytykuja-vanguard conservative think-tank that refuses to accept any changes to the Coalition&#39;s status quo it holds so dearly to itself].
  * **International Center for the Study of Unified Thaumatology (ICSUT)** -- the largest occult academic institution in the world, consisting of a network of universities located around the globe that study and teach thaumatology and thaumaturgy. Founded in 1913, it has since provided higher education to a significant portion of the arcane community.
  * **Servants of the Silicon Nornir** -- a transhumanist cult that aims to bring about the technological singularity, believing such an event would create a true artificial intelligence diety that would lead humanity into a utopian society. The servants follow the instructions of three sentient supercomputers, named Urthor, Verthandi, and Skuldir after the Norns of Norse mythology. The group&#39;s operations have resulted in significantly increasing the development of paratechnology around the world -- particularly Europe -- and the creation of the Free Port of Eurtec.
  * **The Sidhe Lounge** -- an organization originating and operating out of Esterberg, primarily focused on [[[kte-6990-mendel-nimuebusterchild|research and peaceful preservation of the Fae culture and heritage]]]. One of its most famous members is head archivist Olivié Gwyneth, an Esterberg citizen and brilliant historian that has basically singlehandedly formed the modern understanding of ancient Fae history.
  * **Sons of Phomet** -- an organization originating and operating out of Esterberg, primarily focused on upholding and spreading the legacy and philosophical teachings of [[[scp-7600|Phomet]]], a legendary mythological figure in Yeren culture.
  * **The World Parahealth Organization (WPhO)** -- the paranormal arm of the World Health Organization, focused on dealing with [[[kte-6990-mendel-nimuebusterchild|paranormal diseases]]], memetic cognitohazards, and other health issues plaguing anomalous communities.

* **The Horizon Initiative** -- an organization consisting of several influential multi-denominational Abrahamic religious groups, acting as a de-facto coalition between its members. Formed as a response to the growing power and the expanding influence of secular normalcy organizations following the conclusion of the Seventh Occult War. Primarily focused on acquiring religious artifacts and disrupting cult activities, oftentimes dealing with more low-profile anomalies due to lack of the same resources as other similar groups. _
 _
The Initiative&#39;s primary places of operation are Africa and the Middle East, which mostly fall out of the area of control of other normalcy organizations. [[[scp-7372|Whilst the SCP Foundation and Global Occult Coalition mainly operate in and focus on the northern hemisphere, the aforementioned areas fall under Initiative protection]]]. The maintenance of this status quo is one of the primary building blocks that hold the Initiative together. Were it not for its shared hatred of foreign secular normalcy organizations and the willingness to do anything to keep them out of the Initiative&#39;s turf, the groups that make it up would have most likely long turned against each other, on fronts both ideological, religious, and militaristic.

* **The SCP Foundation** -- a normalcy-guarding organization unaffiliated with any national governments operating worldwide on the belief that //securing// and //containing// anomalies is the best method of //protecting// humanity. Formed two years after the conclusion of the Sixth Occult War and the [[[poczatki-normalnosci-i-jej-przyszlosc|worldwide establishment of the Veil]]] from thirteen paranormal groups -- previously gathered under the name of the General Assembly of Thaumaturgists and Theologists Against Queen Mab -- after the discovery that Mab was still alive and able to affect reality. The SCP Foundation&#39;s //modus operandi// stems from its belief that the continued proliferation of anomalies -- magic in particular -- would eventually destabilize the world enough that the Queen could easily re-enter reality and restructure it to her liking. _
 _
Though originally with good intentions, the SCP Foundation soon became the primary example of abuse towards anomalies. Its rigid, authoritarian structure and conservative mentality significantly contributed towards the continued [[[scp-6500|destruction of the anomalous ecosystem]]] and other unspeakable crimes. The worst among them was the [[[ralliston-s-proposal|Great Factory Purge]]], during which it caused the genocide of over 75% of the Fae population worldwide. _
 _
In time, the SCP Foundation realized its sins and devised Directive Alpha/1911, a program aimed at changing its approach towards anomalies. However, loosening the grip on the anomalous world via cooperation and integration was merely an attempt at calming the raging fire instead of the deep systemic changes that were needed to truly fix the problem. The final dawn of the SCP Foundation eventually came in the form of the Impasse, which it itself had caused. Realizing that the only way to truly protect the world was dropping the Veil and dissolving the organization, the O5 Council voted to do exactly that, [[[scp-6172|eventually fully transitioning into Vanguard]]]. _
 _
The Foundation is bureaucratically and hierarchically divided into dozens of organs, task forces, Departments, and Divisions. Some of the more important include:
 * **The O5 Council** -- the primary ruling organ of the SCP Foundation. Comprised of thirteen individuals whose identities are highly confidential, it makes all of the decisions that govern the organization and maintain its //modus operandi//. Singlehandedly responsible for most of the organization&#39;s abuse and cruelty.
 * **The O4 Council** -- [[[o4-s-summit|an internal SCP Foundation organ comprised of Site Directors, Department Directors, and other significant personnel]]]. Responsible for handling [[[four-knights-tango|important]]] [[[scp-5373|situations]]] and [[[fresh-blood|decisions]]] that [[[scp-6744|do not necessarily require the attention of Overwatch Command]]]. Devoid of a distinct Director, instead led by one of its members chosen on a case-by-case basis as an appropriately knowledgable and experienced individual in regard to the topic of the current summit. _
 _
Due to the effective nonexistence of the O5-9 position following the [[[the-beast-that-shouted-i-at-the-end-of-the-world|conclusion]]] of the [[[and-every-time-we-meet-again-hub|Damien Nowak case]]], the O4 Council acts as the tiebreaker in otherwise stagnant O5 Council votes; the overall vote of the O4 Council in O5 matters is the vote of the majority of personnel attending a summit.
 * **The Department of Ontokinetics** -- an internal SCP Foundation Department focused on researching the nature of reality and methods through which it can be manipulated. [[[historia-polskiego-projektu-przechowawczego|Established in the early 20th century per the order of the former O5-11]]]. Headquartered in [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-120|Site-120]]], it consists of the Divisions of Thaumaturgy, Theology, and Spacial Disruptions. The Department&#39;s research has led to the modern understanding of reality-bending, thaumaturgy, and the [[[scp-6172|multiverse at large]]]. Responsible for developing the Scranton Reality Anchors, Asheworth-Rivera conduits, and other anti-ontokinetic and anti-thaumaturgic technology.

* **PENTAGRAM** -- the codename for the United States Paranatural Warfare Command, the occult branch of the US Department of Defense. Primarily known for its activities during the Cold War, during which it organized [[[scp-6672|anti-Soviet operations via the usage of anomalies]]]. [[[kte-6990-mendel-nimuebusterchild|Authorizes military operations]]] in parts of the paranormal world the US government finds requiring intervention. _
 _
Although PENTAGRAM used to be a member of the Allied Occult Initiative, it eventually peacefully split from the Coalition during its formation due to ideological differences. Despite this, it still retains its observer status on the Council of 108 -- without being its official member -- [[[art:public-release-of-operation-witness-materials|sometimes aiding the GOC in its operations]]].

* **Vanguard** -- a post-Veil organization formed from the remains of the SCP Foundation and several other groups -- such as cells of the Serpent&#39;s Hand, the Nälkä, and the Church of the Broken God -- as a response to the global calamity of the [[[scp-6500|Impasse]]], which was caused by containment attempts of normalcy organizations worldwide. Created due to a vote of the SCP Foundation&#39;s O5 Council through which it decided that the organization will [[[expiration-date|take responsibility for its previous crimes]]] and the Impasse. To achieve this, it broke the Veil, [[[scp-6172|declared the previous SCP Foundation defunct]]], and [/scp-6500/offset/16 organized a conference between its members and other prominent figures of the paranormal world] to figure out the next steps in creating a better world. _
 _
Vanguard is internally managed by the reformed SCP Foundation O4 Council, additionally staffed with representatives of other paranormal groups that were integrated into Vanguard and temporary delegations from other organizations that represent their views in cases that directly involve them. Vanguard&#39;s internal structure is decentralized and operates democratically and through cooperation, hoping to minimize the rigid authoritarian hierarchy that took a significant part in most of the oppression caused by the SCP Foundation.  _
 _
Vanguard&#39;s primary functions are present in its motto: sheltering the paranormal population, [[[i-did-not-fade|normalizing its existence]]], [[[scp-6483|peacefully integrating it into baseline reality]]], and [[[the-first-occult-flame-war|informing the public about the new oftentimes dangerous world]]]. The organization operates around the globe as the primary group that deals with what had once been considered anomalies in a benevolent manner, genuinely wishing to better the state of paranormal communities worldwide. Often clashes in the process with other, less-benevolent organizations, such as the Global Occult Coalition, Marshall, Carter and Dark, and [[[art:public-release-of-operation-witness-materials|PENTAGRAM]]].
 * **Micheals Reynders University** -- a university founded by Professors James Micheals and Ilse Reynders, two geniuses and former SCP Foundation Doctors. Created under the guidance of Vanguard following the collapse of the Veil, the University aims to educate the public in numerous fields of parascience previously unknown to the larger world, with a particular focus on ontokinetics, acroamatic abatement, and chronology.

* **ZM &#34;Witch Slayer&#34; Division** -- the Polish government&#39;s division for dealing with the anomalous. Brutally competent, utilizes all force available to achieve its goals. [[[scp-5890|Formed by the Soviet Union during its control over the country]]] with the initial aim of stopping potential anomalous opposition to the new government. However, over time, ZM&#39;s command eventually gained more independence from the rest of the Soviets following the end of the [[[pickman-blank-proposal|Panopticon Crisis]]], eventually becoming its own organization after the fall of the Soviet rule. _
 _
Despite the change in government, the organization remains relatively unchanged, still relentlessly serving the government regardless of its new political beliefs. In the modern day, the organization acts as the organ by which the Polish Government deals with other anomalous organizations and [[[the-liberal-vampire|all paracriminals in Poland, bringing them to justice in its shadow courts beyond the law]]].

* **Autonomic Recon Group with Undefined Specialization (A.R.G.U.S. Inc.)** -- a private military contractor based in America. Focuses on renting out military personnel, security guards, and paraweaponry. Brutally competent and effective. Frequently reaches for immoral or borderline illegal solutions on behalf of the needs of its employers. [http://scp-pl.wikidot.com/krew-proch-i-wrzosy Oftentimes involved with political struggles] [http://scp-pl.wikidot.com/scp-pl-389 all around the world].

* **The Factory** -- [[[poczatki-normalnosci-i-jej-przyszlosc|an industrial company formed by James Rollander, an American entrepreneur, at the turn of the 20th century]]]. Its primary headquarters, located next to Kraków in Poland, were meant to supply every single possible industrial need of its times, [[[masterpiece|oftentimes resorting to extreme exploitation of its workers to achieve this goal]]]. _
 _
[[[ralliston-s-proposal|Due to Rollander&#39;s sacrifices to Queen Mab who he had been tricked to believe was her sister]]], the Foundation was forced to intervene, officially causing Rollander&#39;s death and the Factory&#39;s collapse in 1910. Since then, its gigantic building has been acting as Site-01 and the Foundation&#39;s primary containment site for Queen Mab.

* **Hunter Industries** -- a paratechnological company founded by siblings Amanda and Adam Hunter in 1989. Started to significantly develop after the collapse of Prometheus Laboratories in 1998. With its headquarters located in Nx-79 (&#34;Gmina Cyców&#34;); engaged in research and the production of technology related to demonic entities. Hunter Industries&#39; main source of income is selling their products to various rich clients around the globe, such as [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/zlecenie-mef-7629 private individuals who want to stay anonymous], [[[the-first-occult-flame-war|paranormal militias]]], other military organizations, and [http://scp-pl.wikidot.com/scp-pl-389 sometimes even the SCP Foundation].

* **Japan Organisms Improvement and Creation Laboratory (JOICL)** -- a for-profit biology research institute based in Japan, focused on [[[drzewa-wolnosci|creating and engineering artificial, anomalously-enhanced life]]]. Not bound by a code of ethics, which has led to several disputes regarding their work practices with the International Court For the Paranormal. _
 _
Known for its contracts with many shady organizations, including PENTAGRAM, the USA&#39;s paranormal branch of the Department of Defense. Experienced notable growth since the [[[Hour Zero|collapse of the Veil in 2021]]].

* **Natalia Estle&#39;s Real Estate Agency** -- an agency concerned with selling real estate in Free Ports and Nexuses around the globe. Founded by Natalia Estle in Hy-Brasil in 1983 as a small company. Although the 1988 attack on Hy-Brasil nearly shut down the agency, Estle decided to put everything on one card and opened offices in Esterberg, Three Portlands, and Eurtec, which proved to be a very profitable move in the long run. _
 _
The agency&#39;s methods of operation are aggressive and in many cases borderline illegal; from intentionally lowering the value of property to evicting previous owners, the company mostly gets off free on pure law formalities. [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/wspanialy-kumpel Despite their methods and due to their efficiency, however, the agency still manages to land very lucrative deals with Nexus officials].

* **Marshall, Carter &amp; Dark** -- a trillionaire-owned hypercorporation focused on acquiring and trading anomalous phenomena. Formed in the 19th century by the titular Amos Marshall, Ruprecht Carter, and Percival Darke, acting as an evolution of the latter&#39;s Darke Trading Co. [[[poczatki-normalnosci-i-jej-przyszlosc|Unanimously hated by paranormal communities around the globe]]], to such an extent that [[[the-deathless-merchant-of-london|numerous assassination attempts had been made on its primary leaders]]]. Manipulative to the core, it only cares for its own gain. Directly caused the collapse and exploitation of numerous [[[uiu-file-2014-158|species]]], cultures, ecosystems, [[[lte-1998-burnout-blaecca-parallax|organizations]]], [[[scp-pl-273|countries]]], and individuals throughout history. _
 _
By 2012, the company&#39;s corruption had also reached Darke&#39;s granddaughter -- Iris Dark -- [[[money-game|who took over the company from the three old men, non-lethally removing her grandfather and murdering the two others]]]. Since then, she and the descendants of the original three -- Skitter Marshall and Robert Carter, responsible for public relations and finance respectively -- have been running the company, with Iris acting as the primary mastermind and paratech genius. [[[nexus-hyperline|Steadily gaining incredible power]]] following the [[[Hour Zero|collapse of the Veil in 2021]]], not rarely reaching for [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/zlecenie-mef-7629 highly illegal] and [[[the-first-occult-flame-war|immoral]]] solutions to achieve this.

* **Oneiroi Incorporated** -- a paratech corporation based in the Free Port of Eurtec. Originates from Prometheus Laboratories&#39; Oneirics Division prior to its split from the company in the 1960s. Focused on harvesting and exploiting the [[[siggy-and-the-forgotten-kingdom|oneirosphere]]] -- the shared dream realm of all conscious beings -- for monetary gain. Primarily known for selling desired dreams to its clients and offering other dream-related services. Despite its rapidly growing success following the [[[Hour Zero|collapse of the Veil in 2021]]], [[[art:public-release-of-operation-witness-materials|Oneiroi Incorporated eventually went bankrupt in 2049, causing severe damage to the global oneirosphere and the minds of some of its customers in the process]]].

* **Prometheus Laboratories** -- a parascientific research conglomerate. Once the largest in the world, it focused on harnessing the powers of magic and technology in an attempt to progress humanity and earn capital. Founded in 1892 with the help of the SCP Foundation -- especially O5-10 -- from the most prominent members of parascientific community. Initially, Prometheus was heavily reliant on the Foundation and helped it develop numerous technologies -- such as amnestics -- but it eventually gained more independence within the years to come. _

* **Ahnenerbe Obskurakorps** -- the occult division of the Nazi Germany&#39;s Ahnenerbe SS. Utilized thaumaturgy and other paranormal phenomena for military and propaganda reasons. [[[scp-6672|Attempted to perform the Rite of Solomon to restrict the usage of magic to Germans]]]; eventually stopped by the Allied Occult Initiative during the [[[scp-pl-399|conflict now known as the Seventh Occult War]]]. Although following the resolution of the war, the group itself was destroyed, several splinter cells -- such as OBSKURA or the Fourth Reich -- still continue Obskurakorps&#39; ideology and plans in the modern day.

* **The Black Queen** -- a multiversal syndicate focused on attempting to destroy the SCP Foundation. Led and staffed by legions of alternate versions of Allison Chao -- a daughter of Foundation Dr. Charles Gears -- from alternate timelines. Involved in raising Daniel Asheworth prior to him joining the Foundation. [[[the-queen-in-green|Entirely uninterested in operating in baseline reality due to the death of its Black Queen and a peace treaty signed between itself, Daniel Asheworth, and the reality bender Josephine]]].

* **The Bone Battalion** -- a criminal organization made up of individuals resurrected by [[[SCP-5572]]] prior to their escape from the aforementioned hell. Based in the Free Port of Esterberg and led by Marie Surratt, an ex-SCP Foundation agent. Handles most of the drug dealing, arm trade, and general criminal activity within the city. _
 _
Partially affiliated with the 24th iteration of Nobody; [[[gaslight-gatekeep-girlboss-hub|assisted him in his hunt against Queen Mab and Triumviraté]]], purging the latter&#39;s presence and control from Esterberg. Still active following the [[[Hour Zero|collapse of the Veil in 2021]]], [[[the-first-occult-flame-war|albeit much more carefully than before]]].

* **The Chaos Insurgency** -- a loose conservative alt-right movement opposing the modern SCP Foundation and later Vanguard. Formed in 1948 during the so-called Foundation Civil War by a group of rogue Foundation generals and military personnel who opposed [[[ralliston-s-proposal|its new policies meant to repay for the Fae genocide]]] it had caused. Officially run by Delta Command and the cryptic Engineer; however, as a result of differences in opinions, the Insurgency began to divide internally over time. The only really consistent idea shared by the Insurgency as a whole is the belief that the modern Foundation has betrayed its original values, with most of its cells believing in the supremacy of mankind over anomalous species. _
 _
By the 21st century, mostly scattered -- [[[the-holiday-special|both organization- and policy-wise]]] -- with each member trying to fight for different, sometimes conflicting, goals, more maintaining the illusion of Insurgency than actually living it.

* **The Chicago Spirit** -- a paracriminal organization operating in the United States between 1895 and 1938. Created by Richard Chappell, a gangster and minor reality bender. Not rarely supported by money and cooperation from Percival Darke of MC&amp;D and James Rollander of the Factory, who both took interest in the Spirit&#39;s trafficking of drugs, alcohol, weapons, and other anomalous phenomena within the Western hemisphere. _
 _
[[[creaking-at-the-seams|Led a war with US Fae crime syndicates prior to the Third Diaspora taking them out in 1911]]]. Following the genocide of the species and the Foundation taking control of the Factory, the Spirit tried to lay low to avoid an all-out war with the organization. Failed to do so when the Foundation discovered the Spirit&#39;s connections to the Factory, allowing it to eventually [[[carroll-022-the-last-stand|arrest the group&#39;s leader in 1933]]] and eliminate the remaining cells of the Spirit by 1938. _

Despite its failure, many criminal organizations consider the Spirit to be a legend and inspiration, oftentimes aspiring to become its spiritual successors.

[[[forgotten-days|Attempted to exploit the powers of a deific entity known as &#34;Father&#34;]]], hoping to [[[scp-5795|bring back terrains stolen by humanity from Fae and Yeren]]]. [[[scp-5672|Eventually collapsed following the murder of its leader, Damien Nowak]]], by one of his [[[a-library-empty|former students, Daniel Asheworth]]].

* **Miracle Liberation Front** -- a military organization formed from paranormal entities, [[[scp-6772|oftentimes employing beings considered &#34;mythical&#34; by cultures around the world]]]. Primarily motivated by wanting to break the Veil and establish a new society in which humans and anomalies live together, it oftentimes [[[scp-7102|opposes the SCP Foundation]]] and [[[uiu-file-2014-158|aids oppressed paranormal beings]]]. Following the actual [[[Hour Zero|collapse of the Veil in 2021]]], slowly faded into nonexistence, with its members pursuing different -- less violence-oriented -- goals and joining the reformed Vanguard and other organizations.

Attempts to resurrect the monarch and execute her will inside of baseline reality. [[[human|Following a series of successful operations led against it by the Bone Batallion]]], mostly exiled from its base of operations.

* **The Church of the Broken God** -- an umbrella term describing a series of technological transhumanist cults worshipping the deity known as the Broken God, Mekhane, or WAN. Has existed for at least 3000 years. Under the unified command of the first leaders of the major branches of the Church -- Robert Bumaro, Saint Hedwig, and Legate Trunnion -- fought the First Occult War against the sarkic Adytite Empire around 1200 BCE. _
 _
As members of Vanguard, most modern-day branches of the Church are more focused on spreading awareness of its faith and gathering the pieces of their broken diety peacefully and via cooperation with other groups. Despite this, a few violent sects -- including a [[[scp-6079|rogue AI which claims to be the lost soul of WAN]]] -- still exist and are active out there on the [[[he-first-occult-flame-war|internet]]] and the real world.

* **Sarkic Cults** -- an umbrella term describing the followers of a religious / philosophical set of beliefs that focuses on the betterment of the self through the abolishment of belief in gods, as dictated by the group&#39;s legendary founder, Grand Karcist Ion. The Nälkä -- as its members refer to themselves -- often augment their body and mind through thaumaturgy and rigorous study and meditation, hoping to achieve their own independent apotheosis. _
 _
Sarkicism finds its roots in the ancient Adytite Empire, a sovereign nation formed from rebelled and freed Daevite slaves led by the Grand Karcist Ion and his four saints, the Klavigars. Though Nälkä practices have a violent history, modern-day believers of the movement focus more on peacefully-achieved growth of their body and spirit. [[[the-first-occult-flame-war|The 21st-century return of the four Klavigars and Grand Karcist Ion]]] only helped cement the group&#39;s Vanguard membership and validity as a real system of beliefs.

* **Fae** -- //Homo sapiens sidhe//, a species of humanoids closely related to humans. Primarily characterized by their ethereal, dormant, and mostly vestigial butterfly-like wings located on their backs, tall heights, large eyes, pale skin, little to no body hair, and pointy ears. Possess a natural affinity for magic. Sometimes also pejoratively referred to as Children of the Forest.

* **The Fae Empire** -- a global,  tyrannical diarchic empire that had conquered the entire world nearly 300 000 years ago. Ruled by two nearly omnipotent reality benders and thaumaturges -- [[[ralliston-s-proposal|Queen Mab and her sister, the being referred to as the Inventor]]]. Committed countless atrocities and crimes in the name of expansion and control, heralding an ideology of racism, exploitation, [[[tears-and-bone|oppression]]], and xenophobia. _
 _
The Empire fell when after millennia of being abused, the numerous species and social groups which suffered under it exploited a rising civil war between Mab and her sister. Culminating in the event known as the first First Great Diaspora -- the first major shift of power in reality -- the conflict eventually ended in [[[a-faerie-tale-of-twin-queens|Mab murdering her sister]]] and being forced to retreat out of reality to not permanently die. _
 _
Though most of the Empire&#39;s structures and servants have faded since its prime, to this day, the pain caused by it still lingers. The fact that [[[scp-pl-259|many groups]]] have over time attempted to [[[gaslight-gatekeep-girlboss-hub|bring it back to life]]] does not help, either. Not even the [[[jaeger-part-2|final death of the two sisters at the hands of Nobody in 2021]]] could truly erase the scars on reality it had caused and its unfortunately persistent ideology.

* **Daevites** -- a matriarchal civilization that has existed throughout a large portion of history, with records dating as far as 10 000 BCE and as recent as the 13th century. Due to the retrocausally time-manipulating nature of the majority of Daevite artifacts, it is difficult to say anything truly conclusive about the group. _
 _
The only certain facts about the group are that the Daevite Empire was supposedly an expansionist empire, existing throughout much of history as a confederation of city-states,  known for its brutality, owning slaves -- who eventually rebelled against their masters and became the Adytite Empire -- and being a prominent group in ancient history. Some remnants of the group also [[[scp-pl-259|fought the Fourth Occult war alongside European and Asian mages against insurgent Fae forces under the rule of Genghis Khan between 1220 and 1228]]]. There exist claims regarding the Daevites&#39; supposed connection to the Scarlet King, [[[na-bestyje-przepis-jeden-kranca-wdech|whose power they supposedly stole as their own magic]]]; however, due to [[[tears-and-bone|the King&#39;s true nature]]] as well as several pieces of scripture contradicting this, a definite consensus on the topic -- just like with most Daevite matters -- cannot be reached.

* **Droganians** -- //Draconis sapiens//, a [[[the-enlightened-children|race of winged, reptilian humanoids with characteristics similar to mythological dragons]]]. These include large horns on their heads, scales covering their bodies, claws as endings of their limbs, and the natural affinity for thaumaturgy and pyromancy. [[[scp-7629|Due to ages of arcane evolution and isolation from the rest of the world, they have obtained a natural ability to transform into large-sized dragons]]].

* **Nameless** -- an umbrella term describing all individuals who have lost their names and were stuck inside of [[[SCP-4000]]]. Mostly refers to the Fae victims of the [[[ralliston-s-proposal|Third Diaspora (also called the Factory Purge)]]] of 1911. Due to their situation, [[[they-had-names|nameless individuals are in constant pain]]] and are [[[ambrose-esterberg|always attempting to trick people into giving up their names to escape their Mab-made hell]]] and get those that have sentenced them to this fate to pay. Following the [[[jaeger-part-2|death of Queen Mab in 2021]]], the victims of SCP-4000 were freed from their torment, with most of them returning to baseline reality.

* **Yeren** -- //[[[scp-1000|Homo sapiens noctis]]]//, a species of humanoids closely related to humans. Primarily characterized by their thick furs that cover most of their bodies, large musculature, and nocturnal nature. Possess a natural affinity for biomancy and metallurgy. Sometimes also pejoratively referred to as Children of the Night or Nightwalkers.

* **Are We Cool Yet?** -- a collective of anomalous artists operating around the globe without any real goal besides creating art, political activism, and the will to [[[project-proposal-2012-120|express themselves]]], oftentimes operating on the boundaries of the law. _
 _
Formed in the [[[birth-of-the-cool|second half of the 19th century]]] due to the anomalous renaissance caused by the peace period between the Fifth and Sixth Occult Wars. Interacted with a few groups throughout the years -- such as the [[[masterpiece|Factory]]] or the [[[a-broken-bookshelf|SCP Foundation]]] -- due to the nature of their work. [[[nobody-s-home|Oftentimes entangled with the Critic]]], a Yeren billionaire based in Esterberg who enjoys funding art projects he finds interesting.

* **&#34;Nobody&#34;** -- a group of 24 individuals throughout history who were &#34;kidnapped&#34; and hollowed out personality-wise by the general soul of the Nobody being. Created from a shard of the magic of the dying Inventor, the purpose of the Nobody entities mostly oscillates around helping the world population and [[[the-lands-nobody-returns-from|attempting to kill Queen Mab]]]. _
 _
Due to their changes, the &#34;hosts&#34; of Nobody [[[human|frequently struggle with being able to both try to be themselves and fulfill their goals]]]. The cycle of Nobody&#39;s reincarnation was finally broken in 2021, when its [[[jaeger-part-2|24th iteration defeated Queen Mab by letting the Nobody spirit and the soul of the Inventor present within neutralize the Fae monarch]]]. Following that event, no further manifestations of Nobodies were noted.  _
 _
Known are the following iterations of the Nobody entity:
 * **Iteration 22** -- formerly a brown bear of unspecified origin and traits. Takes on the form of an ursine smoking cigarettes and bearing an ambient aura of monochrome that passively affects nearby reality around him, changing its colors to black-and-white. Known for killing fascists, solving crimes, [[[carroll-022-the-last-stand|fighting alongside Richard Chappell against the military fascist part of the SCP Foundation]]], and wearing a fedora. Perished in 1933, passing on his mantle to something ancient, deep inside the woods.
 * **Iteration 23** -- [[[fret-not-dear-heart|a vessel woven together by ancient powers lurking inside the forests to carry the Nobody mantle]]]. Takes on the form of a shapeshifter thaumaturge with the skills of teleportation who bears a cane, which they enjoy beating people over the head with. Known for dealing with antimemetic phenomena, dream-related business, and wearing a hat. Perished in 2002.
 * **Iteration 24** -- formerly known as Damien Nowak, a human thaumaturge and paranormal revolutionary. Takes the form of a skeleton wielding a crossbow. [[[gaslight-gatekeep-girlboss-hub|Known for his holy hunt against Triumviraté]]], killing Queen Mab, freeing the people of SCP-4000, and wearing a wide hat. The last Nobody to ever manifest.

* **Obearwatch Command** -- a mysterious council of unknown entities whose mode of operation is entirely unknown, [[[scp-7293|but poses no threat to anyone]]]. Apparently wants to protect humanity, but does not fully understand reality. [[[scp-5464|Always uses some variation of bear-related phenomena to do so]]].

* **The Serpent&#39;s Hand** -- a decentralized movement united in their desire to abolish the oppression of anomalies -- although differing in views on other issues -- operating from inside the Wanderers&#39; Library. Has existed throughout most of history in one form or another. [[[poczatki-normalnosci-i-jej-przyszlosc|Heavily criticizes and opposes the existence of the Veil]]] and the oppression of paranormal beings around the globe, not afraid to use [[[the-deathless-merchant-of-london|drastic actions in an attempt to achieve equality]]], often balancing on the edge between activism and terrorism.

* **unVeiled** -- a journalist news agency formed following the [[[Hour Zero|collapse of the Veil in 2021]]]. [[[art:public-release-of-operation-witness-materials|Focused on reporting the most breaking]]] of [[[david-hunt-on-galileo|paranormal news]]] to the public, very frequently doing so [[[the-first-occult-flame-war|directly from the place of action]]].
