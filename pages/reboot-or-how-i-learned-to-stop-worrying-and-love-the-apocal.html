&#34;Oh God, this is it! It&#39;s happening!&#34;
&#34;Calm down. We&#39;ve prepped for this. What kind of scenario?&#34;
&#34;...AK-class, cause unclear. The signal came from Area-23. Critical containment failure, final countermeasures unsuccessful.&#34;
&#34;Alright. Initiate sequence AK-23. Scranton Reality Anchors fully functioning, time dilation active, reality checks indicate no distortion, we are set on this end.&#34;
&#34;Hume readings stable. Physical Constants Calibrator fully functioning. Initiating reconstruction in 3,2,1...&#34;

**3**
&#34;There&#39;s another one!&#34;
&#34;What was it?&#34;
&#34;Looks like an RK-class. Some kind of... clockwork insects escaped.&#34;
&#34;Got a signal?&#34;
&#34;No, not yet... hold on, wait, yes, the signal has been received, from... Site-21. Critical containment failure, final countermeasures unsuccessful.&#34;
&#34;Alright. SRAs fully functioning, time dilation active, no distortion yet... initiate sequence RK-12- no, wait, 21. RK-21.&#34;
&#34;Hume readings stable. PCC fully functioning. Initiating reconstruction in 3,2,1...&#34;

**17**
&#34;World ended again.&#34;
&#34;What was it?&#34;
&#34;Nothing anomalous this time. Just a nuclear war.&#34;
&#34;Between who?&#34;
&#34;Hell if I know. Looks like some Russian stuff went off.&#34;
&#34;So? What&#39;s the big deal?&#34;
&#34;We got a signal from Site-40. They&#39;re calling it an XK-class.&#34;
&#34;Critical containment failure?&#34;
&#34;Right. Final countermeasures were unsuccessful.&#34;
&#34;Sounds like a bit more than nuclear war to me. Whatever, initiate sequence XK-40. All systems are clear on this end.&#34;
&#34;Everything&#39;s all set. All systems go, initiating reconstruction in 3,2,1...&#34;

**150**
&#34;What the hell, it&#39;s hasn&#39;t even been 2000 years since the last one.&#34;
&#34;Got to be kidding me. What about SK-12?&#34;
&#34;Must&#39;ve gotten instructions from the wrong site!&#34;
&#34;Oh for... never mind. Do it again. Everything&#39;s green over here.&#34;
&#34;Got it. Everything&#39;s set, initiating reconstruction in 3,2,1...&#34;

**635**
&#34;Fucking hell.&#34;
&#34;Oh god, don&#39;t tell me it was-&#34;
&#34;The cakes... again.&#34;
&#34;Oh for- whatever. All set on this end, what about you?&#34;
&#34;Christ, can&#39;t they keep track of this? This is the third time //in a row// those damn cakes have escaped! You know what I did this morning? I woke up and I thought, &#39;hey, maybe we won&#39;t have to reset things.&#39; Then I remembered- we&#39;re only woken up when we //have// to reset things.&#34;
&#34;.... Everything&#39;s green on this end.&#34;
&#34;....sigh, yeah, same here. Hit the reset.&#34;

**665**
&#34;... You know what, fuck this. I&#39;m sick of this bullshit. Let&#39;s set our own parameters.&#34;
&#34;Hold on! We have specific instructions! I have a signal from Site-75!&#34;
&#34;Yeah, but every time we&#39;ve followed those instructions everything goes back to hell within less than 3000 years. Remember sequence IK-50? You can&#39;t seriously tell me that it planned for a dog to poison the Western Hemisphere!&#34;
&#34;I dunno... We got this job for a reason.&#34;
&#34;Yeah? What reason is that? Why didn&#39;t they use computers instead? This is literally the most important device in the universe. So why use a couple of humans?&#34;
&#34;...&#34;
&#34;That&#39;s what I thought. Let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t make some changes. Hell, maybe we&#39;ll do better than whoever came up with these protocols. I&#39;m sick and tired of watching myself grow up, have a family, and then watch everyone I&#39;ve ever known or will know get eaten by some eldritch //thing// for the hundredth fucking time!&#34;
&#34;Okay... but do you know //how// to make changes?&#34;
&#34;Of course. Don&#39;t tell me you forgot what little training they gave you. Come on, I&#39;ll show you how it works. I am done with those goddamn cryopods. We&#39;re in this for the long haul.&#34;

**1365**
&#34;Okay, my turn. Let me see... 43. What&#39;s that correspond to?&#34;
&#34;43...43... ah, here we go! Amphibious humanoids with three genders.&#34;
&#34;So... what do we call the third gender?&#34;
&#34;Let them figure that out. Plug in the values and hit the reset.&#34;
&#34;Everything&#39;s fine on my end.&#34;
&#34;Ditto. Hit it.&#34;
&#34;Wait, hang on! I&#39;m not finished plugging them in-&#34;
&#34;Too late! Reset!&#34;

**2000**
&#34;Here we go, number two thousand!&#34;
&#34;Damn. That&#39;s a hell of a lot of resets. Say, how long have we actually //been// down here?&#34;
&#34;... You know what, I&#39;m not sure.&#34;
&#34;Must be the time dilation. Let&#39;s say... I dunno, hundred million years?&#34;
&#34;Way too long. Two million years.&#34;
&#34;That&#39;s too short!&#34;
&#34;Think about it, every time we reset nothing lasts longer than 3000 years. Usually they blow themselves up like two thousand years in.&#34;
&#34;You keep forgetting about the period of evolution!&#34;
&#34;That doesn&#39;t count! It&#39;s fast forwarded!&#34;
&#34;It&#39;s counted!&#34;
&#34;No it isn&#39;t!&#34;
&#34;It clearly is-&#34;
&#34;Oh shut up!&#34;
&#34;You first!&#34;
&#34;Tch...&#34;
&#34;Whatever, jeez. Two million, happy?&#34;
&#34;//Thank// you. Okay, what do we do for our two-thousandth reset?&#34;
&#34;Let&#39;s see if we can fiddle with what goes on up //here//...&#34;

**2001**
&#34;That wasn&#39;t as funny as I thought it would be.&#34;
&#34;Oh, you think? Tell me, was this before or after they started feeding Jesus old people?&#34;
&#34;Well excuuuuse me for trying to add a little levity!&#34;
&#34;You got the little part right! Just... just reset it already. This is kind of sad.&#34;
&#34;Wait, why don&#39;t we see where this goes?&#34;
&#34;You seriously want to see where this goes?&#34;
&#34;Well, yeah?&#34;
&#34;//Seriously?//&#34;
&#34;Hey, it might be interesting.&#34;
&#34;Can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this but I&#39;d prefer taking a nap than listening to you.&#34;
&#34;The pods&#39;re right there. Go right ahead.&#34;
&#34;I think I will!&#34;
&#34;Fine!&#34;
&#34;Fine!&#34;

**2596**
&#34;We did it!&#34;
&#34;What? Really?&#34;
&#34;Really! Let&#39;s celebrate!&#34;
&#34;With what? There&#39;s no wine in here.&#34;
&#34;Oh come on, isn&#39;t this a little exciting? 3000 years without resetting!&#34;
&#34;What about reset three seventy-five?&#34;
&#34;They blew themselves up like a millisecond before 3000. Not this time! We made it to 3000 years and 35 seconds! Sure, it was by retarding the human race, but you can&#39;t argue with progress!&#34;
&#34;Good enough, I guess.&#34;
&#34;That&#39;s the spirit! Hey, listen. Why don&#39;t we just... kick back this time?&#34;
&#34;Kick back?&#34;
&#34;Yeah. Let&#39;s let the world end, but this time, let&#39;s just see what comes next. I mean, every time something goes wrong, we immediately reboot. Aren&#39;t you a little interested to see what happens after?&#34;
&#34;Well, kind of.&#34;
&#34;Yeah you are!  Just kick back and relax. It isn&#39;t like - //snort// - it isn&#39;t like the world&#39;s gonna end if you do.&#34;
&#34;......I&#39;m hitting the reset.&#34;
&#34;Hey hold on-&#34;

**2597**
&#34;You fucker! What was that for!&#34;
&#34;The joke. It sucked. That wasn&#39;t even a pun.&#34;
&#34;Oh shut up.&#34;
&#34;Seriously though, what kind of joke was that supposed to be?&#34;
&#34;I dunno. An ironic one, I guess.&#34;
&#34;Do you even know what irony means.&#34;
&#34;... Does it even matter?&#34;
&#34;I don&#39;t want to live in a world with your jokes.&#34;
&#34;.....Oh shut up. Look what you did. Only twenty-seven hundred years before scorched earth this time.&#34;
&#34;Wouldja take a look at that! I don&#39;t think that color&#39;s ever been described on the visual spectrum before!&#34;
&#34;Thought for sure that dumbing &#39;em down would work. What do you think went wrong?&#34;
&#34;Eh, we&#39;ve got time to figure it out. What do you think it is?&#34;
&#34;It&#39;s boring as shit is what it is.&#34;
&#34;Tch, plebeian.&#34;
&#34;Plebe-what the //fuck//?&#34;
&#34;What?&#34;
&#34;Plebeian, that&#39;s what! Nobody&#39;s used that word in millions a&#39; years!&#34;
&#34;We watched language evolve yesterday.&#34;
&#34;Oh you know what I mean!&#34;
&#34;I do. You&#39;re an idiot.&#34;
&#34;... Takes one to know one!&#34;
&#34;Do you look in the mirror a lot?&#34;
&#34;That doesn&#39;t even make sense!&#34;
&#34;Shut up!&#34;
&#34;Ow! Hey!&#34;

**2598**
&#34;Grrk! Let go!&#34;

**2599**
&#34;Grrf!&#34;
&#34;Rrrgg!&#34;

**2600**
&#34;Guh!&#34;
&#34;Gaah!&#34;
&#34;...&#34;
&#34;...&#34;
&#34;Oh shit.&#34;
&#34;Oh shit? Oh //shit//.&#34;
&#34;It&#39;s sparking, what does that mean?&#34;
&#34;It means it&#39;s broken, you idiot!&#34;
&#34;I&#39;m the idiot! You&#39;re the one whose elbow got lodged in it!&#34;
&#34;You&#39;re the one who lodged my elbow in it!&#34;
&#34;This isn&#39;t helping! How do we fix it?&#34;
&#34;I don&#39;t know! I only know how to operate it!&#34;
&#34;Shit it&#39;s sparking some more!&#34;
&#34;What do we fucking-&#34;

**2601**
&#34;Oh God, this is it! It&#39;s happening!&#34;
&#34;Calm down. We&#39;ve prepped for this. What kind of scenario?&#34;
&#34;...AK-class, cause unclear. The signal came from Area-23. Critical containment failure, final countermeasures unsuccessful.&#34;
&#34;Alright. Initiate sequence AK-23. Scranton Reality Anchors fully functioning, time dilation active, reality checks indicate no distortion, we are set on this end.&#34;
&#34;Hume readings stable. Physical Constants Calibrator fully functioning. Initiating reconstruction in 3,2,1...&#34;
