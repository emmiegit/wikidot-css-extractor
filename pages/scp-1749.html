**Item #:** SCP-1749

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1749-1 is contained in the [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/log-of-anomalous-items-vol-iii|Safe/Anomalous Items]]] of [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-11|Site-11]]]. No testing of SCP-1749 has been scheduled to date. Any recovered specimens of SCP-1749-2 are to be contained in standard humanoid containment cells in Site-28. Access to specimens of SCP-1749-2 requires written permission from Site-28&#39;s director (Currently Dr. █████) or any member of the O5 council.

**Description:** SCP-1749-1 is an ornately-painted control pad consisting of an analog screen and a standard QWERTY keyboard. When a message is typed onto the screen of SCP-1749-1 and the &#34;send&#34; button is pressed, specimens of SCP-1749-2 are created in locations around the continental United States.

SCP-1749-2 are genetically identical humanoids. Every recorded instance of SCP-1749-2 to date has been a Caucasian male, between 24 and 36 years of age and approximately 2 meters tall. All specimens of SCP-1749-2 answer to the name █████ ████████, though no individuals with that name matching their description have been found in any birth records.

Upon the activation and input of a message into SCP-1749-1, numerous instances of SCP-1749-2 will materialize in populated locations around the continental United States. No more than one instance has been observed in any single location. Upon materialization, each instance of SCP-1749-2 carries with them the following items:

* One (1) ██████ brand black business suit.
* One (1) █████ ██████ brand pair of black dress shoes, size 46.
* One (1) █████ brand silver wristwatch.
* One (1) handgun, containing a fully loaded magazine. Markings on the handgun match no known manufacturer.
* One (1) pill containing 2ml of potassium cyanide.

When all instances of SCP-1749-2 have materialized, they will immediately seek out and kill the nearest human by means of gunshot. If the instance of SCP-1749-2 is disarmed, it will attempt to bludgeon or strangle the victim to death using nearby objects or its bare hands. Immediately following the murder, the instance of SCP-1749-2 will procure and consume its cyanide pill, causing death in 99% of cases. If unable to do so, the instance of SCP-1749-2 will self-terminate with its firearm. Neither living instances nor cadavers of SCP-1749-2 have been found to contain any additional anomalous properties.

The following is a transcript of an interview with a captured SCP-1749-2 instance (designated SCP-1749-2-134) whose cyanide pill failed to activate before Foundation agents confiscated its firearm. SCP-1749-1 had been activated by the Foundation in an attempt to contain an instance of SCP-1749-2. Dr. ███ conducting interview, Dr. █████ on supervision.

&gt; **Dr. ███**: State your name and date of birth for the record.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1749-2-134**: █████ ████████, date of birth unknown.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███**: Please explain your objectives at the time of your capture.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1749-2-134**: I was sending a message.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███**: Sending a message to whom?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1749-2-134**: To people. You know, doc, it&#39;s getting harder and harder to get noticed these days. Short of blowing up a building or starting a war, not much gets through to people&#39;s heads. And even if you shoot a school or build a bomb, nobody really gets what you&#39;re trying to say. They just don&#39;t get it. Too stupid. Too oblivious. What I was doing is telling people the exact message in a way that they&#39;ll really pay attention to. That&#39;s all people care about these days, all they care about is blood. So why not write in it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███**: So the control pad was built to send messages to civilian populations?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1749-2-134**: Yeah. These morons snap out of their slumber once they see the death on the map. It&#39;s the most powerful writing system on the planet. You just have to connect the dots. Oh, and one more thing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███**: Yes?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1749-2-134**: Fuck you.
&gt;  

At this point, SCP-1749-2-134 self-terminated by means of a secondary cyanide capsule hidden in its back molar. Investigation of other instances revealed similar capsules, though all instances questioned denied awareness of their existence.

**Incident 1749-Beta**: On █/█/████, a series of murders were committed in civilian population centers by individuals identical to instances of SCP-1749-2. As SCP-1749-1 was inactive at this time, it is theorized that additional models of SCP-1749-1 may exist. Foundation intelligence teams have been dispatched with the intent to recover any additional instances. Reclassification to Euclid effective █/█/████.
