[[/div]]

Dr. Esperanza Velasco-Iglesias tapped her pen against the clipboard in her hand as her eyes fell onto the main laid out flat in her office couch. It wasn&#39;t often that the agents she saw allowed themselves to get comfortable during these therapy sessions. Most came in alert, sitting at full attention if they sat at all. Even as Sias laid out, though, Iglesias could see the strain in his back and the slight twitch in the corners of his mouth.

Her lips folded into a slight scowl.

&#34;Agent Sias?&#34; she spoke, her soft voice breaking the silence in the room. He didn&#39;t respond, simply staring at the ceiling. She tried again, with more force. &#34;Agent Sias!&#34;

Sias&#39;s head snapped to attention, looking almost like a child who had been scolded. He gave Iglesias an apologetic smile.

&#34;I have to admit, I&#39;m stuck on this one. No amnestic exposure, and according to the medical department there are no signs of dementia or Alzheimer&#39;s. I&#39;ve got a theory on what&#39;s wrong here, but I need you to talk to me.&#34;

The smile vanished from Sias&#39;s face as he looked back to the office ceiling. Iglesias sighed, removing her glasses from her face.

Silence hung in the air between them.

&#34;...What&#39;s wrong, Sias?&#34; Iglesias finally said, &#34;Why are you in here today?&#34;

Sias pursed his lips before he turned his head back towards Iglesias. He fiddled with a silver ring on his left hand.

&#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34;

&#34;You don&#39;t know.&#34; Iglesias leaned back in her chair, resting the clipboard on her lap. &#34;When you say that, are you being serious or are you just not ready to talk? It&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t want to talk yet, but I need to know so we can help you.&#34;

&#34;I don&#39;t...&#34; Sias sighed, &#34;I really don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s come over me all of a sudden. You could ask me to name what I&#39;m feeling right now, and I wouldn&#39;t be able to tell you. I just don&#39;t know //what// it is. I keep trying to think about my life right now, trying to think of //something// that would leave me feeling... tired? Numb? I don&#39;t want to call it depressed, it&#39;s not that.&#34;

&#34;Is it anxiety?&#34;

Sias shook his head. &#34;No, not anxiety either. My life is fine right now, at least I think it is. My husband is the same as always, home is fine.&#34;

&#34;How&#39;s your daughter?&#34;

&#34;Growing up too fast. Like all kids do.&#34;

He gave a gentle smile, the first one to reach his eyes yet this meeting. Iglesias smiled in return, the wrinkle on her brow betraying her frustration.

&#34;And the memory problems?&#34;

The smile vanished from Sias&#39;s face, and he turned towards the ceiling again.

&#34;Please, Sias. I want to help you get better.&#34;

&#34;I... started thinking about my life, you know? Growing up, how I got here, all that. For whatever reason I just... can&#39;t remember. I have these vague ideas and moments, little pieces of something that happened. A rock to the knee, nights on a playground, getting //really// mad at my mom over something, but nothing that comes together in a cohesive picture. I could tell you the names of people I knew, maybe even describe their faces, but what we did together and how I knew them?&#34;

His breathing picked up as he began to pick at a loose button on the couch.

&#34;So when I say I don&#39;t know I&#39;m serious. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m feeling, I don&#39;t know what I remember before the Foundation. I feel like something is missing, I guess. If I had to explain it.&#34;

His hands curled into fists as a scowl settled on his face.

&#34;And I feel so fucking stupid that I&#39;m even thinking about this shit.&#34;

Sias brought his hands to his face in exasperation, trying to cover his eyes. Iglesias chewed her bottom lip, looking back to her notes. She gave Sias a quick glance before quickly finishing off her report.

[[/div]]

Sias&#39;s hands returned to his sides, picking at loose fabric on the couch. He looked back to Iglesias, his eyes ever so slightly reddened.

&#34;Maybe I just need amnestics. Can&#39;t be bothered by half memories if you just get rid of what&#39;s left after all, right?&#34; he said with a weak chuckle. The smile faded when Iglesias shook her head in response.

&#34;I have another idea, but I&#39;ll need you to go to sleep for me.&#34;

-----

The screen lit up Iglesias&#39;s face as she reviewed the diagnostic information one final time. Before her Agent Sias was laid out on a cot, an IV drip of soporifics stuck into his arm. His chest rose and fell with a gentle, consistent rhythm.

With a final click from Iglesias, the set of wires hooked up to something under Sias&#39;s pillow came to life alongside another screen on Iglesias&#39;s desk. Putting on her headset, she heard a voice from the other side.

&#34;Hm? You have need of me?&#34;

&#34;Good to hear from you, Ixmucane.&#34;

Ixmucane, known to the Foundation as SCP-6506, was little more than a barely thumb-sized doll made of cloth and wood in the waking world. When placed under the pillow of someone sleeping, however, she came to life in their dreams, hunting down their worries and whisking them away. It was initially Iglesias&#39;s idea to put her to therapeutic use, after experiencing her powers firsthand. The two became partners shortly after, regularly diving into the dreams and memories of patients struggling with issues that went beyond what traditional therapy methods could address.  

&#34;Right now I&#39;m just seeing a black screen. Can you verify that&#39;s what you see as well?&#34; Iglesias asked. Ixmucane held her arms up to her eyes, and they appeared on the screen in kind.

&#34;The dreamscape has yet to manifest. I imagine we have at least some time before it does. Am I permitted to ask what has happened?&#34;

&#34;The patient reports memory issues, specifically long term memories,&#34; Iglesias responded.

&#34;You are aware that I am unable to repair illnesses of the mind, yes?&#34; Ixmucane said. it wasn&#39;t visible on the screen, but Iglesias could tell she had a quizzical expression on her face.

&#34;I remember. Trust me, I remember pretty well,&#34; Iglesias chewed the inside of her cheek, trying to push aside the memory intruding in her mind, &#34;But I also remember how you work. Even if this doesn&#39;t.... we&#39;ll say &#39;fix&#39; Sias for a lack of better words, I know we can get some insight here. Just bear with me.&#34;

&#34;As you wish.&#34;

[[div class=&#34;outside&#34;]]

The black void before Ixmucane slowly came to life bit by bit, the scene of the dreamscape slowly populating itself. It appeared to be shaping into a children&#39;s playground of some kind, looking almost as if it had been taken straight from an early 2000&#39;s cartoon. The structures had thick, black outlines and harsh shading. Ixmucane gingerly reached a hand out to one, verifying that it was indeed sturdy.

The rest of the scene constructed itself. The playground was on the edge of a wooded area, with picnic tables vaguely visible in the distance. It was difficult to see far beyond them, as the area almost appeared to be enveloped in a thick fog. The sound of children laughing alongside the crunch of mulch beneath sneakers caught Ixmucane&#39;s attention, and she turned her eyes back towards the park. Several children, likely no older than eight or nine and each rendered with the same uncanny cartoonish way as the rest of the park, had appeared and begun playing with one another.

&#34;...There. Look towards the swings,&#34; Iglesias&#39;s voice buzzed in Ixmucane&#39;s head. Looking towards the swings a small child with tanned skin, shaggy brown hair, and hazel eyes was seen swinging back and forth. Next to him swung another child, though it was impossible to say who they were or how old. They were featureless, a smooth form vaguely pressed into the shape of a human child.

&#34;Come on! Higher!&#34; The brown haired child laughed, &#34;I bet you can&#39;t go all the way around!&#34;

The sound of distorted static rung through Iglesias&#39;s headset.

&#34;It is too!&#34; The brown haired child said, in response to an unheard statement, &#34;My mommy says all the time that you can&#39;t swing too hard &#39;cuz you&#39;ll go allllll the way around. Betcha can&#39;t do it!&#34;

&#34;Any ideas, Ixmucane?&#34;

Ixmucane shook her head. &#34;No. I have yet to see a dreamscape like this before, and I am not sure how to proceed-&#34;

Ixmucane was interrupted by the sound of creaking metal. Turning back towards the swings, the two figures began swinging back and forth, steadily increasing in speed as they did. Eventually they both swung around the pole, continuing to move in forward motion.

&#34;Now jump! Jump!&#34;

Both figures leapt from the swings. The formless humanoid continued to rise in the sky as the brown haired boy began to descend towards the ground. He landed flat on his back and a loud cracking sound echoed through the park. The space went silent. Looking around, Ixmucane couldn&#39;t see the other children. Her attention was fixated once more on the boy, who had begun to cry. She approached him, resting a hand on his arm. He grabbed her in an embrace and thrust his crying face into her stomach. She gently stroked his hair as the scene around them began to change.

The cartoonish features melted away. Where there were once thick outlines and harsh shadows was now cold metal and plastic. The fog in the distance vanished as well, revealing a cool fall evening. The brown haired child vanished and reappeared sitting tucked away in the play castle. Gentle sobs filled the otherwise still space as the child sat with his legs tucked tight to his chest. Ixmucane began to move towards the child, until she heard the crunching of gravel under sneakers behind her. Turning to face it, she saw another young boy around the same age as the first running up to the park, a dodgeball tucked beneath his arm. His shaggy blond hair was tangled with sticks and leaves, and the myriad of bandages along his arms and legs revealed that this was likely not an uncommon thing.

The new child paused at the edge of the park before carefully tiptoeing towards the play castle and climbing up. The brown haired child paid him no mind, continuing to cry into his knees.

&#34;Hey! Why&#39;re you crying?&#34; the blond boy said, cocking his head to the side.

&#34;Go away!&#34; the brown haired boy sputtered.

In seeming defiance against being told what to do, the blond boy sat himself down right next to the brown haired boy. He placed the ball on the ground in front of him, drumming his fingers on its rubber surface.

&#34;I haven&#39;t seen you before! What&#39;s your name?&#34; he asked. The brown haired boy didn&#39;t respond. &#34;My name is Wyatt!&#34;

Wyatt gave the other boy a wide grin, revealing he was already missing at least three teeth. He reached out a hand to the other. The brown haired boy regarded the gesture with suspicion before timidly taking the hand into his own.

&#34;I&#39;m Basil.&#34;

&#34;Basil? Is that your real name?&#34;

Basil puffed his cheeks out.

&#34;Yes it&#39;s my name! I know it&#39;s a dumb name, leave me alone!&#34;

Wyatt threw his hands up in innocence.

&#34;I didn&#39;t say it was dumb! I thought it was cool!&#34;

Wyatt watched as the frustration left Basil&#39;s face. He almost smile for a moment, but that smile was quickly replaced with another scowl as tears welled in the corner of his eyes again.

&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;

The well of tears quickly became a waterfall in response to this question.

&#34;My... my //stupid// daddy dragged me and mommy here!&#34; Basil sputtered in response, &#34;I wanted to go home, so I ran away!&#34;

Wyatt&#39;s mouth dropped in horror at Basil&#39;s confession.

&#34;You can&#39;t run away! That&#39;s the //worst// thing anyone could do! Ever!&#34;

&#34;Oh yeah? W-well!&#34;

Basil&#39;s face grew red as he struggled to find a response.

&#34;W-well... maybe it&#39;s better if I do. Maybe mommy and daddy will stop fighting if I do.&#34;

A loud rubber thwack echoed through the park. Basil held his hand up to his warm, reddened cheek as tears began to well in his eyes once more. He looked to Wyatt with rage.

&#34;What&#39;d you do that for?!&#34;

Wyatt picked up his recently thrown ball, smiling.

&#34;When my head starts thinking bad thoughts, playing makes it better!&#34;

&#34;Yeah but that //hurt//!&#34;

&#34;Yeah but it&#39;s gonna get better right?&#34;

Basil cocked his head to the side. His brow remained furrowed, but the anger had faded.

&#34;Huh?&#34;

&#34;The hurt on your cheek. It&#39;s gonna get better, right?&#34; Wyatt asked, as if the answer was obvious. Basil was clearly still confused, but Wyatt continued. &#34;All hurt goes away! So if your bad thoughts are making you hurt, that means those&#39;ll go away too if you let them!&#34;

He smiled, clearly proud of his line of reasoning. Basil giggled.

&#34;You&#39;re weird.&#34;

&#34;You&#39;re //weirder//!&#34; Wyatt retorted, sticking his tongue out.

The two sat in silence for a moment. Night had fallen, and the gentle serenade of crickets filled the area. After some time, Wyatt stood, ball in hand.

&#34;Wanna play? I&#39;ll help you go back home after.&#34;

&#34;Yeah.&#34;

The two boys stood and descended from the play castle, running to a nearby field. Ixmucane followed, eventually settling on a nearby bench. Iglesias&#39;s voice buzzed in her head.

&#34;Still nothing?&#34;

&#34;There is no reason to interfere,&#34; she said, eyes watching the two boys kick the ball back and forth. &#34;Sometimes you merely need to let the memory play out. All will be well.&#34;

As if to contradict her, the skies above suddenly darkened and a wind began blowing. What sounded like massive footsteps boomed through the surroundings.

&#34;BASIL!&#34; A deep, angry voice screamed, &#34;BASIL SIAS!&#34;

Basil winced and shrunk down in place, curling back into his knees. Wyatt looked around, confused. A massive, dark form approached from beyond.

&#34;THERE YOU ARE!&#34; it boomed, &#34;DO YOU KNOW HOW WORRIED YOUR MOTHER HAS BEEN? HOW WORRIED //I&#39;VE// BEEN? WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY FOR YOURSELF?&#34;

The scenery cracked a fell away, leaving Ixmucane and Basil alone in a dark void. The child rocked in place, knees curled tightly to his chest as he attempted to speak through heaving breaths.

&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry...&#34;

He repeated the phrase over and over. Ixmucane shook her head.

&#34;Iglesias, terminate the dream. I do not believe there is more I should do here.&#34;

&#34;You&#39;re sure about this?&#34;

&#34;Yes. I believe this next step is yours to take.&#34;

[[/div]]

Back at her desk, Iglesias tapped away at her keyboard. With one final click, the feed ended. Sias remained asleep nearby. Iglesias shook her head. Ixmucane had never demanded that a dream end before. Even if the problem wasn&#39;t immediately evident, or if it took multiple dreams to solve, she had always allowed them to end naturally.

Iglesias stood, looking over at Sias. His breaths, rhythmic before, had become erratic. A cold sweat settled on his furrowed brow, and she could almost make out tears in the corners of his eyes.

-----

Two days later Sias returned to Iglesias&#39;s office. He had returned to the same position as before-- laid out across the office couch in a feigned display of comfort, hands folded across his chest and eyes affixed to the ceiling. Silence hung between the two like before, somehow even heavier than it had been during the first meeting. It was only broken when Iglesias cleared her throat.

&#34;So... is there anything in particular you would like to discuss with me?&#34; she asked, her voice betraying the uncertainty of the question.

&#34;No.&#34;

It was a quick, curt response. Iglesias opened her mouth to respond, but was shocked into silence by Sias continuing.

&#34;I don&#39;t know what you did to me last session, but I haven&#39;t been able to sleep since.&#34;

He rolled his head over and met Iglesias&#39;s eyes for the first time in that meeting. His face bore the signs of exhaustion. Dark circles had settled under his eyes, and his normally somewhat disheveled hair appeared even more unkempt than usual. His shirt, the same black button down that he had worn during the first session, was a wrinkled mess.

&#34;It&#39;s just a form of therapy we practice when necessary,&#34; Iglesias spoke with an air of clinical professionalism, &#34;A common tool for certain mental cases is sleep therapy, so--&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s not what I mean, and I think you know it.&#34;

Iglesias bit her lower lip. It was unlikely Sias knew that SCP-6506 had been used on him-- based on Ixmucane&#39;s documentation and her own personal experiences with the doll, Iglesias knew that sleeping subjects only ever recalled the most intense moments of their dreams, and the cloth woman was almost never remembered if the dreamer wasn&#39;t lucid. While Iglesias had the full record of Sias&#39;s dreaming experience, it was clear he lacked it.

&#34;Please tell me about your experience, then,&#34; Iglesias said, recomposing herself and brushing a flyaway hair from her face, &#34;Let&#39;s get on the same page here. Help me help you.&#34;

Sias gave a dramatic sigh, sounding almost like a child. He sat up on the couch, and fixed his eyes on a piece of art hanging on Iglesias&#39;s wall, avoiding eye contact with the therapist. He twisted the ring on his left hand as he spoke, his voice sounding strangely distant.

&#34;I remember a dream at least. Ideas of it. I was at a park, I think it was the one that was in the neighborhood I grew up in. I remember being hit in the face with something, and right after that this dark... thing started yelling my name. I think I woke up after that.&#34;

Iglesias listened with rapt attention, furiously scribbling notes into her clipboard.

&#34;So what&#39;s it all mean, doctor?&#34; Sias said.

&#34;Well...&#34; Iglesias spoke carefully. She couldn&#39;t risk revealing too much to her patient about what she had seen in his head, nor did she imagine he would take particularly kindly to it all. &#34;Let&#39;s start with something simple here. That park, was it important to you?&#34;

Sias scratched the side of his head with a finger for a moment, before a sense of recognition appeared on his face.

&#34;Yeah, it was. I remember now, it was the night I moved to Nanticoke,&#34; Sias snapped his fingers, and his eyes lit up. &#34;I... ran away from home that night, and hid out in the little playground just up the street.&#34;

Sias turned to Iglesias, an embarrassed smile on his face and a light blush on his cheeks.

&#34;If I got it right I was actually planning to go all the way back &#39;home&#39;. My little kid brain thought that was a totally reasonable thing to do.&#34;

&#34;Where was home before?&#34; Iglesias asked as Sias gave a slight chuckle.

&#34;Barcelona. Like I said, little kid logic. I guess I thought I could walk from Pennsylvania to Spain.&#34;

This got both Sias and Iglesias laughing, and for a moment the room felt lighter.

&#34;Anyway,&#34; Sias continued, &#34;I was really overwhelmed by everything, and ran away. I must&#39;ve gotten scared at some point because I wound up on the playground. Another kid found me there...&#34;

Sias snapped his fingers several times in succession, a frustrated wrinkle forming in his brow.

&#34;Wyatt.&#34;

&#34;Yeah, Wyatt,&#34; Sias said, eyes wide. He looked to Iglesias. &#34;How&#39;d you know that?&#34;

&#34;Oh! I, um...&#34; Iglesias adjusted her glasses and pretended to flip through her notes as Sias eyed her, &#34;Just a good guess, I suppose. Wyatt is someone important to you according to the files, so...&#34;

Sias&#39;s brow remained raised in response, seemingly unsatisfied with this explanation. His eyes fell to the ring on his finger, and he gave a gentle smile.

&#34;...Anyway,&#34; he continued, &#34;that&#39;s right, it&#39;s coming back together. Wyatt found me and hit me in the face with a ball.&#34;

The corners of Sias&#39;s mouth curled into a fond smile as he recounted the story. How the scrappy blond kid found his hiding place, and despite his best efforts to scare the newcomer off, remained by his side until his hurt and frustration at his situation finally melted away. He grew more animated as he spoke, his arms finally leaving his side as he gestured. More details came to light as well, things that hadn&#39;t been shown in the dream. He recounted how Wyatt&#39;s ball had actually popped after Sias kicked it into a tree, and the two had cried for quite a bit. Towards the end, however, that fond expression began to fade, replaced by one of worry. He began to chew on the inside of his cheek and grew silent.

&#34;Sias?&#34;

&#34;Sorry, I&#39;ve been chatting your ear off about some childhood nonsense haven&#39;t I?&#34;

Sias did his best to hide his worry with another dismissive smile. Iglesias shook her head, and put down her clipboard.

&#34;No, this is good. It&#39;s progress. Something&#39;s bothering you though, isn&#39;t it? What else happened that night?&#34;

He responded with a shaking sigh. A wandering hand began picking at the buttons on the couch.

&#34;Someone found us... dad, I&#39;m pretty sure it was dad. He was pissed that I had run off, and he really let me know it.&#34;

&#34;Your dad...&#34; Iglesias flipped through her notes, &#34;Tyme Sias, right? He was assigned to [[[SCP-6103]]] until--&#34;

Sias raised a hand.

&#34;Right, that&#39;s him.&#34;

Sias&#39;s eyes fixed themselves on the ceiling once more. His face was expressionless, only betrayed by a slight sparkle of light in the corners of his eyes.

&#34;Your father... what kind of man was he?&#34;

Sias shook his head.

&#34;Not now, please,&#34; he spoke, barely in a whisper. Iglesias nodded.

&#34;Understood. We can stop here for today.&#34;

Sias turned his head, hand still absentmindedly fidgeting with the button on the couch.

&#34;Hey I&#39;m... sorry for being so standoffish when we started. It wasn&#39;t fair to you. I can&#39;t promise I&#39;m going to be all warm and open, and I&#39;m not going to pretend that I enjoy this, but...&#34;

He twiddled his thumbs as he spoke.

&#34;...There&#39;s someone I need to do this for. If you&#39;re willing to put up with me, I&#39;d like to continue with the dream therapy thing.&#34;

&#34;I would love to. Promise me you&#39;ll actually get some regular sleep, though.&#34;

He responded with a weak chuckle before rising to his feet and leaving the office with a quick nod.

[[div class=&#34;outside&#34;]]

Ixmucane opened her eyes once more, gazing out across what would soon be another dreamscape. For now, however, it was an all too familiar black void. She crossed her arms over her chest, waiting for a familiar voice to echo in her own head.

“Ixmucane, you there?”

“Yes, I am here.”

&#34;Excellent. We&#39;re going to continue with the dream therapy we started with Sias last time. You still on board?&#34;

It wasn&#39;t like she had much of a choice to deny. While the Foundation had never been outwardly unkind to her, Ixmucane was well aware of her position within this facility. That said, it wasn&#39;t like this bothered her. Her duty had always been to ease the burden of worry from those who used her, and as such this was just part of that divinely assigned task. Besides, Iglesias had always been respectful of her and her approach to dreamscapes.

&#34;Of course,&#34; Ixmucane replied.

The dreamscape around her began to flicker to life, with small sparks of light appearing off in the distance. Ixmucane smiled.

&#34;I see you were able to handle things on your end. I do appreciate it when my handlers are competent.&#34;

&#34;Hm? Why do you say that?&#34;

&#34;You&#39;ve shaken the box his memories are stored in, so to speak,&#34; Ixmucane said, cradling a spark of light that manifested near her. It cast a gentle glow on her face. From within the spark, the voices of children playing could be heard. &#34;This is going to be a joint endeavor, Iglesias. As I said I cannot heal a mind that is sick, merely ease its worries. And this mind...&#34;

She trailed off, gazing at the lights that continued to manifest around her. They floated about aimlessly, appearing almost like fireflies on a dark summer night. Some would approach, almost as if aware she was there, and cast a gentle warmth onto her cloth arms. Others darted away if they grew too close, a sense of chilling cold emanating from them.

&#34;This mind has a lot of worries.&#34;

Ixmucane held out her arms and twisted her wrists. In response, the lights ceased their movement in rapt attention. She pulled her arms down, causing the lights to form a single line. There were well over a hundred of them in total, each shining with a different intensity.

&#34;What are you doing?&#34; Iglesias asked, eyes fixed on her video feed.

&#34;Organizing. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve figured it out, but these are all memories, in a way. Dreams that might be. I&#39;ve set them out so that we might decide how to approach this matter.&#34;

&#34;I think I&#39;d like to try to put a proper timeline together here. Could we start with another early childhood memory? Specifically after the one we saw last time.&#34;

&#34;Of course. One moment.&#34;

Ixmucane waved her arms about once again, causing several of the lights to scatter off and vanish. After some time, she was able to gather a set of around twenty lights before her. Without waiting, she grabbed one and threw it towards the ground, where it exploded in a blast of light. When the light cleared, Ixmucane found herself in a small dining room. It was modestly furnished with a round wooden table big enough to seat around six or so people. The walls were completely covered in a myriad of haphazardly placed family photos. Some were stacked on top of one another in vague and esoteric layouts, and most could not be clearly understood. Others, however, more clearly depicted a familiar blond boy and two adults- a tall and powerfully built man with short black hair, and a woman who bore a striking resemblance to the blond boy.

&#34;Please warn me before doing that next time,&#34; Iglesias said, &#34;That REALLY hurt my eyes.&#34;

&#34;Apologies.&#34;

Looking back to the table, Ixmucane saw Basil, the same age as he had been in the prior dream, alongside Wyatt and the blonde woman from the photos gathered. Basil sat stiffly, hands tugging at the hemline of his pants, whereas Wyatt and the woman were clearly more relaxed. Their mouths were moving, though no sound could be heard.

&#34;Ixmucane, what&#39;s going on? I thought this was a memory?&#34;

&#34;It is, yes, though it is a memory as seen through a dream. Dreams are odd, fickle beasts. They can distort the mind into thinking impossibilities, allowing one to take flight and swim in the stars above, but they can also distort moments precious to us. Humanity should be glad that they fail to remember most of them,&#34; she said with a scowl.

&#34;Luckily,&#34; Ixmucane continued, &#34;I have experience with such things. Watch.&#34;

Ixmucane walked over to where Basil sat, before taking his seat and passing through his body. She felt her perception fall as the room around her grew in size, and a sudden wave of anxiety fell over her. In spite of her best efforts, she found herself mirroring the actions the boy had been performing prior and continued to pick at an unseen hem on her leg.

&#34;Are you okay, sweetie?&#34; the woman asked, a gentle kindness in her voice. Her lips smiled, but the furrow of her brow showed her worry.

Ixmucane gave a quick nod.

&#34;You don&#39;t have to stay if you aren&#39;t comfortable you know. If this is all too much you just let me know and I&#39;ll walk you home.&#34;

&#34;But mommy!&#34; Wyatt attempted to protest, but was silenced with a raise of the woman&#39;s hand.

&#34;No buts, mister. If Basil isn&#39;t comfortable he has the right to leave if he wants to. You have to listen to other people&#39;s wants sometimes, even if you don&#39;t want it.&#34;

Wyatt dropped his head, pouting. Ixmucane shook her head, and felt words cautiously flow from her lips.

&#34;No I wanna stay. It&#39;s okay.&#34;

The woman flashed a bright smile in return, before leaning over and whispering something into Ixmucane&#39;s ear.

&#34;Todo estará bien, chiqui.&#34;

She leaned back with a mischievous smile, and Ixmucane&#39;s eyes went wide.

&#34;You speak Spanish?!&#34; she said, incredulous. The woman giggled.

&#34;Oh just a little bit. When Wyatt told me our new neighbors were from Spain I figured it couldn&#39;t hurt to brush up a bit.&#34;

&#34;Mommy speaks lots of languages!&#34; Wyatt added with pride, clearly over the scolding he had received. The woman gave a dismissive wave.

&#34;Nothing quite that impressive... ah! Looks like dad&#39;s finished with dinner.&#34;

The man from the photos appeared, quite literally pushing his body into the room through a doorway that was far too small for him. His face was obscured by shadow, and the food he held in his hands was a strange mush of colors and textures. Ixmucane felt herself shrinking away from him, attempting to hide away in her seat. The woman reached out and gently laid her hand on her arm, rubbing her thumb over it.

&#34;It&#39;s okay, sweetie. Mr. Bayside isn&#39;t a mean guy. He may look a little scary, but he&#39;s a real sweetheart.&#34;

Ixmucane looked to the woman and back to the man. He had shrunken back down, the shadow disappearing from his face. While still a large man by all definitions, he now more realistically matched the photos on the walls. The vague slop that he previously held had been replaced with a tray of cheeseburgers and homemade fries.

&#34;Sorry to scare you, buddy!&#34; Mr. Bayside said with a wide smile as he placed the food on the table, &#34;Are you hungry?&#34;

Ixmucane gave an eager nod, and both adults laughed in response. Wyatt attempted to grab a burger first, only to have his mother slap his hand away. He retreated back to his seat, rubbing his hand sheepishly with a look of indignation on his face.

&#34;Guests eat first Wyatt, you know the rules.&#34;

Ixmucane could feel her cheeks warm up as all eyes focused on her. She watched as Mr. Bayside placed food on a plate in front of her, and hesitantly took an exploratory bite. Satisfied with the taste, she voraciously finished it. The sound of the Bayside family laughing could be heard as the dreamscape faded, leaving Ixmucane back in the void.

&#34;Is that it?&#34; Iglesias asked.

&#34;No. This is merely the brain filtering out unmemorable details, things that it thought unimportant. The dream is still active.&#34;

As if in response to Ixmucane&#39;s words, the dreamscape reformed itself. This time, she found herself in what appeared to be a child&#39;s bedroom. A mess of toys, clothes and paper littered the floor, with the worst of the mess congregating around a bright red racecar bed along the center of the room&#39;s back wall. Though the lights were on, glow in the dark star stickers could be seen stuck around the walls and ceiling in various places. Along the walls were various posters of what might have been athletes, though it was difficult to make out their vague forms and shapes.

Mrs. Bayside entered the room alongside Basil and Wyatt, putting her hands on her hips at the sight of it.

&#34;Wyatt! I told you you needed to clean this place up before Basil came to stay the night. What is all this?&#34;

Wyatt threw his hands up and shrugged.

&#34;Shirts and toys?&#34; he replied, as if it were the obvious answer. Mrs. Bayside crossed her arms.

&#34;Clear out a space for Basil so he has a place to sleep, mister. And goodnight you two, don&#39;t stay up too late, alright?&#34;

&#34;Yes, ma&#39;am,&#34; Basil said as Wyatt got to work clearing off a section of the floor.

Basil watched in silence, holding a rolled up sleeping bag under his arm.

&#34;Cool car.&#34;

&#34;Thanks!&#34; Wyatt replied, beaming with pride, &#34;It&#39;s red, my favorite color!&#34;

Basil just quietly nodded, glancing around the room. While Wyatt continued to clean, Basil flicked off the light switch. His eyes lit up in wonder as the stars around the room began to glow.

&#34;Hey! Why&#39;d you do that? I can&#39;t see!&#34; Wyatt protested.

&#34;I wanted to see the stars,&#34; Basil retorted with a matter-of-fact tone.

Ixmucane gazed around the room. The walls and ceiling had transformed themselves. Where once there had been simple plastic stickers, there were now swirling galaxies and nebulae dotted with hundreds upon hundreds of shimmering stars. Basil walked out into the room and looked up with wide eyes, spinning around to take the sight in. After a moment, he flopped onto his back and into a pile of clothes, staring at the ceiling.

&#34;Do y&#39;like stars?&#34;

Basil nodded fervently in response. Wyatt approached and laid down next to him.

&#34;I do too,&#34; Wyatt continued, &#34;They&#39;re really pretty! Sometimes my mommy and dad take me to a hill nearby and we go... uh...&#34;

&#34;Stargazing!&#34;

&#34;Right! That! We look at the sky. Mommy likes to trace out shapes with her finger, and dad likes to talk about how old everything is.&#34;

Basil was silent for a moment, lost in thought. He turned to Wyatt.

&#34;Your parents are really nice to each other.&#34;

Wyatt raised an eyebrow.

&#34;Of course they are. Mommies and daddies are supposed to be.&#34;

&#34;Really?&#34; Basil replied, a sense of confusion in his voice. He huffed, falling back into the pile of clothes. Wyatt laid in place awkwardly, tapping his fingers on the ground. Eventually he spoke up.

&#34;Do y&#39;think that aliens are real?&#34;

&#34;Of course they are!&#34; Basil responded, whatever prior anxieties in his mind melting away, &#34;There&#39;s lotsa stars, which means there&#39;s gotta be lotsa other Earths with people on &#39;em.&#34;

&#34;Yeah, I think so too!&#34; Wyatt said with a confident nod, &#34;I&#39;ll bet they look like bugs! Big scary bug monsters!&#34;

Basil shot up and gave Wyatt a pointed glare.

&#34;Nuh-uh! They&#39;re people like us! Just with... uhm... green skin!&#34;

The dream began to fade once again as the two children continued debating. Just before it all vanished away, however, she could almost swear she heard what sounded like the laugh of an adult woman in the distance.
