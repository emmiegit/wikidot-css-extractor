**Item #:** 7284

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Two members of MTF Psi-17 (&#34;Long Haulers&#34;) are to be stationed inside of SCP-7284-1 to ensure any affected individuals are amnesticized and able to exit the anomaly.

**Description:** SCP-7284 is the designation given to a Shell gas station on United States Route-66. When driving near SCP-7284, witnesses report an unidentifiable voice on their car radio, urging them to drive into the parking lot of SCP-7284. Upon hearing the voice, there are two possible outcomes:
Â 
* If the affected individual drives into the parking lot of SCP-7284 and purchases gas or other products from the anomaly, the anomalous effects will cease.

* If the affected individual chooses to drive past SCP-7284, they will be transported to SCP-7284-1. SCP-7284-1 is a direct copy of the 10 mile area surrounding SCP-7284 in an unknown location. The only known structure present in SCP-7284-1 is SCP-7284. Upon reaching the end of SCP-7284-1, the affected individual will be teleported back to the beginning. However, if the affected individual chooses to buy a product from SCP-7284 while within SCP-7284-1, they will be transported to the non-anomalous Route-66.

**Discovery:** SCP-7284 was discovered during a routine anomaly transport conducted by Agents Frank Armstrong and Luka O&#39;Neil. As the transport was recorded through the use of a camera on their dashboard, their encounter with the anomaly was recorded.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**O&#39;Neil:** Are we there yet?

**Armstrong:** Dude, you sound like a toddler.

**O&#39;Neil:** Not my fault you&#39;re going 50 in a 70. Aren&#39;t we carrying something that could fundamentally change the way the public understands the universe and their place in it?

**Armstrong:** And that&#39;s exactly why I can&#39;t afford to crash this car.

**O&#39;Neil:** (chuckles) You mean the Foundation can&#39;t afford you crashing this car. I mean, are you even trying to drive? I feel like I&#39;m in the car with my grandma.

//Silence.//

**O&#39;Neil:** Oh, fuck off. You&#39;re going slower now, aren&#39;t you.

**Armstrong:** Shouldn&#39;t have complained. My driving is like cooking rice. The more you look at it, the slower it goes.

//Static can be heard over the radio as the agents near SCP-7284.//

//Armstrong tries to turn off the radio, but is unable to do so.//

**Armstrong:** Come on, turn off.

**O&#39;Neil:** Can we file a complaint for them making us drive this piece of shit?

**Armstrong:** Trust me, the complaints never go anywhe-

//The static stops, and a voice can be heard on the radio.//

**SCP-7284:** Hot shell station in your area, ready to sell goods and/or... services.

**O&#39;Neil:** Did somebody hack the radio?

**Armstrong:** I hope so, or that&#39;s the worst advertisement I&#39;ve ever heard.

**O&#39;Neil:** Or the best?

**Armstrong:** Just turn it off.

//The agents drive past SCP-7284. Approximately nine minutes later, they enter SCP-7284-1.//

**Armstrong:** Does this look familiar to you?

**O&#39;Neil:** Yeah, that cactus over there, and that one over there, and that slightly elevated pile of dirt. Oh wait, that&#39;s what everything looks like.

**Armstrong:** I&#39;m being serious, we should&#39;ve seen our exit by now.

**SCP-7284:** Is that how it is? You&#39;re just gonna ignore me? Toss me away like all those other stations?

**O&#39;Neil:** I thought you turned the radio off.

**Armstrong:** I did, but it&#39;s back on someh-

**SCP-7284:** Oh, so now you just want to turn me off? Well, y&#39;know what, I was never turned on. I&#39;ve been faking all those pumps.

//The agents drive past SCP-7284 again.//

**Armstrong:** Something weird is going on. Is the anomaly secured?

//O&#39;Neil reached into the backseat and touches a large bag.//

**O&#39;Neil:** Yeah, it&#39;s still in the bag.

**Armstrong:** I&#39;ve got a bad feeling about this. Call the director.

//O&#39;Neil attempts to call the director, but is unsuccessful.//

**O&#39;Neil:** No service. Then again, that seems perfectly normal while we&#39;re in the middle of BFE.[[footnote]]Acronym for the slang phrase &#34;bum-fuck egypt&#34; referring to a remote location.[[/footnote]]

**SCP-7284:** You can&#39;t just ignore me. You know, I looked through your phone. What&#39;s this shit about finding a Buc-ees[[footnote]]Buc-ees is a gas station popular within the United States.[[/footnote]] near you? What does she have that I don&#39;t?

//The agents pass SCP-7284 again.//

**O&#39;Neil:** That fucking gas station. How much you wanna bet it&#39;s an anomaly?

**Armstrong:** I don&#39;t think I&#39;d win that bet. We just need to keep going. Eventually they&#39;ll figure out that the transport wasn&#39;t completed on time and they&#39;ll search for us.

**O&#39;Neil:** What if this is a temporal anomaly? We could be stuck in here forever.

**Armstrong:** I prefer to look at it with a glass-half-full attitude.

**SCP-7284:** You used to buy snacks from me all the time, Armstrong. What happened to that? What happened to our relationship? Was I not good enough for you?

//O&#39;Neil looks at Armstrong.//

**O&#39;Neil:** That sounds like a you problem. Should&#39;ve bought more snacks, man.

**Armstrong:** I swear I didn&#39;t cause this.

**SCP-7284:** So our relationship didn&#39;t happen? Is that how forgettable I was to you?

**Armstrong:** I- You know what? I&#39;m not taking shit from a gas station.

//The agents pass SCP-7284 again.//

//Sobbing can be heard on the radio.//

**SCP-7284:** Is this what you do to all the other stations? You drive in, get a few gallons, maybe buy a soda, and then leave?

**Armstrong:** You have to understand. You provide things that I need when I do these transports. It&#39;s a purely platonic relationship.

**SCP-7284:** Is that all I am to you? A place to dump your money?

**Armstrong:** Okay, that&#39;s not what I mean and you know it.

//The agents pass SCP-7284 again.//

**O&#39;Neil:** When you woke up this morning, did you think you&#39;d be needing marriage counseling for your relationship with a gas station?

**Armstrong:** Can you shut the fuck up?

**SCP-7284:** What did you just say to me?

**Armstrong:** Hold on, that was meant for-

**SCP-7284:** No, I understand now. You come in for a quick fill and then you leave. Well, I filled your brother too.

**Armstrong:** I-

**SCP-7284:** That&#39;s right. He came through here needing gas a few months ago, and I filled him all the way up.

**Armstrong:** I don&#39;t really ca-

**SCP-7284:** And you know what? He&#39;s a better fill than you. Way better. He does all the things in the parking lot that you can&#39;t.

**Armstrong:** That doesn&#39;t matter. Hundreds of people get gas here every day.

**SCP-7284:** Hundreds? Are you calling me a slut now?

//Armstrong is silent as the agents pass SCP-7284 again.//

**O&#39;Neil:** You really need to stop talking. You&#39;re just making all of this worse.

**Armstrong:** Are you siding with the sentient gas station?

**O&#39;Neil:** We&#39;re gonna be stuck in here regardless of if I provide emotional support, might as well have fun until we&#39;re rescued.

//Silence.//

**O&#39;Neil:** Hey, do we have any drinks? Snacks?

**Armstrong:** This isn&#39;t a road-trip. If you want to have Cheeto dust covering your fingers when we&#39;re ambushed, go ahead, but you&#39;re paying for it.

//The agents pass SCP-7284 again.//

//O&#39;Neil glances to his right and looks at SCP-7284.//

**O&#39;Neil:** No way. I&#39;m not going in there alone.

**SCP-7284:** Why don&#39;t you come in and talk to my face. When you break my heart, you can at least look me in the eyes.

**O&#39;Neil:** Can you just get this over with and deal with her? She obviously wants you.

**Armstrong:** Fine.

//The agents take a right turn into the parking lot of SCP-7284.//

**Armstrong:** I&#39;m going to regret this.

//Armstrong grabs the camera and walks into the gas station. O&#39;Neil waits outside.//

**Armstrong:** Hello? Anybody here?

//Loud static can be heard on the intercom before SCP-7284 begins speaking.//

**SCP-7284:** Here you are, crawling back to me. What, do you need to piss? Are you thirsty?

**Armstrong:** No, I just want to stop this.

**SCP-7284:** So you&#39;re willing to use other bathrooms but mine is too &#34;dirty&#34; for you? Wasn&#39;t too dirty when the gas was cheap.

**Armstrong:** Can you just let us go? I&#39;m done dealing with this. I just want to finish this transport and go home.

**SCP-7284:** Why? Am I not enough for you?

**Armstrong:** (mumbles) Not when you&#39;re acting like a bitch.

**SCP-7284:** What the fuck did you just say to me? I&#39;m a bitch? I&#39;m a bitch?! Oh, really? I&#39;m not the one who sleeps around with other stations and-

//The voice fades away as Armstrong leaves the store and walks out to the car.//

**O&#39;Neil:** Did it go well? Is she letting us go?

**Armstrong:** Probably not.

**O&#39;Neil:** Well, worth a shot. Can you hand me your card? Gotta get some gas if we plan on using the car to drive out of here.

//Armstrong pulls his wallet out of his pocket and hands O&#39;Neil his debit card.//

//O&#39;Neil begins paying for the gas.//

//Silence.//

//The sounds of vehicles can be heard.//

**Armstrong:** Wha-

//Armstrong bumps into a young woman.//

**Woman:** Oh, sorry.

//Armstrong stares at the woman.//

**Woman:** Are you okay?

**Armstrong:** How are-

//Armstrong pauses and looks around for a second, noticing three vehicles in the parking lot.//

**Armstrong:** Yeah, sorry. I was just thinking about something.

//Armstrong walks over to O&#39;Neil.//

**Armstrong:** Don&#39;t react, but we&#39;re back on the normal highway.

**O&#39;Neil:** Huh? Oh, should I call the director?

//Armstrong nods.//

**Armstrong:** Also, grab the amnestics. I don&#39;t think we were here when that woman looked over.
