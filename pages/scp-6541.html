**Item #:** SCP-6541

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6541 is to be stored in a waterproof, airtight standard hazardous object containment locker. Further testing of SCP-6541 is pending Ethics Committee Review.

**Description:** SCP-6541 is an antique bear trap, typical in design of devices produced in the late 19th century, that occasionally displays autonomous behavior, most commonly when in line of sight of a sentient observer. 

SCP-6541 will engage in violent behavior towards any female human, typically attacking and maiming the individual until the victim either flees or dies. Following this, if there are no other individuals satisfying SCP-6541&#39;s criteria for aggression, it will revert to a docile or inanimate state.

The degree of sentience possessed by SCP-6541 is unknown.


**Notes:** 

&gt; I must remind personnel that spreading rumors regarding re-assignment of staff from an anomaly warrants disciplinary measures for unprofessional conduct. It is frankly none of your business how or why someone is re-assigned. Focus on your job, and less on rumors. All of our words have impact, so be mindful of your prejudices and how they are externalized. Bigotry towards your fellow coworkers will not be tolerated. Thanks.

I know that we have a strict dress code but I was wondering if you would let me incorporate like, some kind of mini-skirt into my outfit? It would be really good for me.

So, I think I would be a great candidate to lead testing on SCP-6541 after its recent acquisition. I know that you probably have doubts after my hospital stay last month, but trust me, I can handle this. I&#39;m gonna file the paperwork and get to work. Everyone needs to move past my announcement anyways

It hasn&#39;t really done anything crazy yet. I dunno, I was expecting something conclusive. the thing just sits there usually. 

Maybe it can&#39;t see very well? They pass well

**Subject:** Some stuff about the thing

So Jamie said that we lost a few female D-Class during SCP-6541 testing, but I dunno if he said that to get a reaction out of me. You know he can be a big cunt sometimes.

Also, I was wondering if you read about the miniskirt thing? I&#39;m kinda over them anyways, too stereotypical.

I&#39;m gonna try using D-Class with a higher dosage. Or maybe post-op. That should change the result and get a reaction. so far its just not... I&#39;ll get back to you with more

Disregard my last email

at this point, I think I&#39;m going to go in myself. these d class can&#39;t follow orders very well and some of them are frankly not looking the way I do. and its also been hard to get some post op personnel too

science does require risks, after all
