**Special Containment Procedures:**  As SCP-5164-A instances cannot be moved without causing irreparable damage, multiple Stationary Task Forces (currently Kappa-32, Mu-11,  Phi-09, Sigma-18 and Gamma-16) have been deployed throughout Wake Island in order to ensure none of the SCP-5164-A instances are destroyed or damaged.

**Description:** SCP-5164 is an anomalous phenomenon currently affecting  Wake Island, which provokes the generation of anomalous crystals (hereinafter referred as &#34;SCP-5164-A&#34;) throughout the entire island. This phenomenon appears to only affect Wake Island, as surrounding territories have not been affected by SCP-5164.

SCP-5164-A refers to an undetermined number (estimated to be around 3,865 million) of solid small crystal gems that vary in shape and color, although all of these instances present seemingly random color changes that decrease with the passage of time, being always transparent when newly created.

SCP-5164-A instances have direct effects on individual human relationships[[footnote]] More specifically, on engagement relationships between subjects that are in love with each other. [[/footnote]] when physically modified, as shown in the test log below.

**__RESEARCHER IN CHARGE:__** Dr. Peter Roxby

**__SUBJECTS INVOLVED:__** D-2718, D-2273

**__DATE:__** January 12, 1935

**__PROCEDURE:__** D-2718 and D-2273 were exposed to multiple stimuli in order to generate an emotional link between each other, which would have led to the formation of a relationship and the generation of an SCP-5164-A instance that would have been used in future tests.

**__RESULT:__** A few moments after the settlement of the relationship, a new SCP-5164-A instance was created, which turned purple after 3 hours. It was later confirmed that D-2718&#39;s favorite color is red, and D-2273&#39;s favorite color is blue.

**__TEST #:__** 5

**__RESEARCHER IN CHARGE:__** Dr. Peter Roxby

**__SUBJECTS INVOLVED:__** D-2718, D-2273

**__DATE:__** May 25, 1935

**__PROCEDURE:__** The SCP-5164-A instance was cut slightly 16 times using a small blade with the purpose of checking what kind of damage to SCP-5164-A instances was necessary to negatively affect the relationship.

**__RESULT:__** Both subjects expressed that their mate talked to them in an unusually cutting or biting way, but eventually got used to it. Some small negative changes, such as mistrust, were observed during the first 2 days, but they quickly ceased after 2 more days.

**__TEST #:__** 8

**__RESEARCHER IN CHARGE:__** Dr. Peter Roxby

**__SUBJECTS INVOLVED:__** D-2718, D-2273

**__DATE:__** May 29, 1935

**__PROCEDURE:__** The SCP-5164-A instance was fragmented using a hammer and a chisel in order to estimate its resistance.

**__RESULT:__** The crystal easily fragmented, measuring an approximate 6 points on the Mohs Scale. When the instance was fragmented, however, it quickly lost its color and luster, turning transparent again in a few seconds, and no additional color changes were observed after 16 days. At the time the SCP-5164-A instance was shattered, it was reported that D-2718 and D-2273 began to argue in an aggressive tone. The argument continued to escalate until the two began to beat one another before being restrained by Site-19 security personnel. Posterior questioning revealed that both subjects broke up. Any further attempts to reunite the subjects failed.

**__TEST #:__** 9

**__RESEARCHER IN CHARGE:__** Dr. Peter Roxby

**__SUBJECTS INVOLVED:__** D-2718, D-2273

**__DATE:__** May 30, 1935

**__PROCEDURE:__** The 2 fragmented SCP-5164-A instance&#39;s halfs were weld again into their original position with the purpose of determine whether or not the repairment of an instance would be able to fix previously broken relationships.

**__RESULT:__** Shortly after this, D-2718 and D-2273 expressed to show interest in each other again by &#34;sudden and unknown reasons&#34;, although &#34;things would not be exactly like the first time&#34;. The progress of the relationship was closely followed by 2 weeks, and it was determined that both subjects were successfully in love again.

**__TEST #:__** 10

**__RESEARCHER IN CHARGE:__** Dr. Peter Roxby

**__SUBJECTS INVOLVED:__** D-2718, D-2273, Res. Vanna Kore, Dr. Stephen Gonsalvez

**__DATE:__** June 17, 1935

**__PROCEDURE:__** The SCP-5164-A instance was split again into two pieces, and another instance, choosen randomly, was also split. Then, each upper half was weld to the opposite lower half.

**__RESULT:__** The second SCP-5164-A instance was found to correspond to the one generated by Res. Vanna Kore and Dr. Stephen Gonsalvez&#39;s relationship; both subjects were gathered with the participant D-Class personnel. When the SCP-5164-A instances were fragmented, all subjects lost interest in their respective couples and broke up. Shortly after that, Res. Kore began to interact with D-2273 several times, apparently wanting to befriend her, suggesting a potential bound influenced by the SCP-5164-A hybrid instance. However, Dr. Gonsalvez and D-2718 didn&#39;t show any interest in each other; the reason for this is still unknown.

**__TEST #:__** 11

**__RESEARCHER IN CHARGE:__** Dr. Peter Roxby

**__SUBJECTS INVOLVED:__** D-2718, D-2273, Res. Vanna Kore, Dr. Stephen Gonsalvez

**__DATE:__** June 17, 1935

**__PROCEDURE:__** Both hybrid SCP-5164-A instances were split again, and each upper half was weld back to its respective lower half.

**__RESULT:__** When the SCP-5164-A instance corresponding to Res. Kore and Dr. Gonsalvez was weld again, their relationship did not recovered and eventually ended; further attempts to make the subjects fall in love again failed. The instance corresponding to D-2718 and D-2273, on the other hand, regained its purple color in ~2 hours after its repairment, and both individuals later confirmed to be dating again.

The following are the logs of important incidents that caused massive destruction of SCP-5164-A instances.

[[div style=&#34;display: inline-block; border:solid 2px #999999; background: center no-repeat #e4e4e4; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px; box-shadow: 0 1px 8px rgba(168, 168, 168);&#34;]]

**__EVENT:__** An unnamed typhoon provoked by an unregistered anomaly[[footnote]] Later confirmed to be an unidentified giant human body bound in chains to a coffin located in Isla Ángel de la Guarda, Mexico, and classified by the Latin Council as SCP-ES-███ [[/footnote]] passed near the Wake Island.

**__DATE:__** October 19, 1940

**__AMOUNT OF SCP-5164-A INSTANCES DAMAGED:__** Approximately the 20% of the instances (772.9 million)

**__ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:__** Most Foundation personnel present on the Isle died due to a lack of shelters equipped to withstand climatic conditions of this nature. A disinformation campaign was undertaken in order to cover the damaged relationships in the United States, Mexico, and Canada as an effect of the collective hysteria caused by the typhoon passing by. The statistics of couple problems from other parts of the world were altered by the Foundation to cover the incident. The cost of these operations was estimated at $70,242,500 USD.
After this incident, the Foundation initiated construction of a Site to operate under the jurisdiction of Site-19 in the Wake Islands. The new Site was built to withstand typhoons and cyclons and also serve as a shelter for the Stationary Task Forces housed on the island. The Site was designated as &#34;Site-27&#34; and was covert under the facade of a military base in the area.

[[/div]]

[[div style=&#34;display: inline-block; border:solid 2px #999999; background: center no-repeat #e4e4e4; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px; box-shadow: 0 1px 8px rgba(168, 168, 168);&#34;]]

**__EVENT:__** 36 Japanese bombers flew over Wake Island, and raided it destroying most of Site-27. It was later confirmed that many of the troupes involved in the attack used anomalous technology, developed with the help of the IJAMEA.

**__DATE:__** December 8, 1941

**__AMOUNT OF SCP-5164-A INSTANCES DAMAGED:__** Approximately the 16% of the instances (618.4 million)

**__ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:__** Site-19 was informed about the attack, and multiple Mobile, Aerial and Naval Task Forces were deployed in order to help Site-27 personnel. The conflict ended 15 days later, on December 23, and the cost of damages caused to Site-27 were estimated at $327,600,000 USD. As most of the affected relations could be attributed to the general social tensions caused by World War II or belonged to individuals that died in combat, the Foundation did not need to run any disinformation campaign.
The IJAMEA was pointed out as being responsible for this, along with the Japanese government. After multiple deliberations, the O5 Council decided to undertake multiple efforts to destabilize the IJAMEA and thus be able to establish a Japanese Council in the territory, successfully achieving it in the course of 4 years.

**__EVENT:__** Category 4 Typhoon Olive hit the Wake Island, causing major damage in most of the structures settled in there, including part of Site-27, and flooded the Island.

**__DATE:__** September 16, 1952

**__AMOUNT OF SCP-5164-A INSTANCES DAMAGED:__** Approximately the 32% of the instances (1236.8 million)

**__ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:__** The containment chamber housing the SCP-5164-A instances managed to withstand Olive&#39;s first hit and did not receive important damage until ~2 hours before the typhoon began to move away from the Wake Island, a moment in which the ceiling of the chamber cracked, and eventually collapsed. Most of the debris was warded off by Olive, but some parts of it still damaged an important number of SCP-5164-A instances.
The Foundation undertook multiple disinformation campaigns in many countries and modified the statistics about couple problems. However, those campaigns were not as successful as the ones undertaken in 1940. The O5 Council approved the use and development of subtle behavioral experimental memetic agents that were deployed on recorded media. The cost of repairing Site-27 and the expenses required to maintain the Veil were estimated at $160,000,000 USD, and some projects&#39; budget was cut or deviated in order to cover the costs.

**__EVENT:__** Category 5 Hurricane Ioke hit the Wake Island.

**__DATE:__** August 28, 2006

**__AMOUNT OF SCP-5164-A INSTANCES DAMAGED:__** Approximately the 8% of the instances (309 million)

**__ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:__** Site-27 personnel was able to enact the H-RF[[footnote]] Herbert Reflective Field. It is a paratechnological device capable of generating a semi-spherical kinetic field, effectively acting as an almost indestructible solid body while active. It is an enhanced version of the now obsolete Garlés Reflection Field, which was discontinued in 1983 due to causing fires and irreversible spatial distortions around it. [[/footnote]] in time before the hurricane hit the Island. However, while Ioke was moving away from the island, the H-RF began to exhibit slight failures due to the strength of the typhoon and the time it was being active. At that time, the H-RF failures were dismissed, and it stayed on for one more hour, before it began to show severe failures. The emergency use of additional H-RF Units was authorized, which were quickly transported to the area and two were activated to replace the damaged one. During the Unit switch, some rubble entered the containment area, damaging a medium number of SCP-5164-A instances. Although a good part of Site-27 was not severely affected by the hurricane, the containment area of the SCP-5164-A instances was almost completely knocked down by the storm surge that followed due to the remnants of Ioke.
The cost of repairing Site-27 and the expenses required to maintain the Veil were estimated at $88,000,000 USD.

[[/div]]

[[=image http://destinox.wikidot.com/local--files/cupideishon/CrystalAddendumB2.png]]

After the incidents provoked by Hurricane Ioke, Site-27 personnel reported a broken SCP-5164-A instance still showing color and a slight glow. After multiple research, it was found that this crystal belonged to Anne de la Rev and Jake Stevenson, civilians residing in Alaska, United States. It was later confirmed that both individuals were still engaged despite the fragmentation of their SCP-5164-A instance.
Several investigations were made regarding the reason for this; however, they did not give conclusive results, so multiple hypotheses have been made in this regard, such as: 

* Possible anomalous influences due to an unknown event in which one or both individuals were involved
* Possible anomalous qualities present in one or both subjects, which have not been confirmed yet
* Possible altered levels of Humes of one or both individuals
* The &#39;strength&#39; of the relationship
* The old age of the SCP-5164-A instance, since their relationship was settled on in 1957

On February 6th, 1945, once the SAGRSV[[footnote]] Systematized Anomalous Graphical Resonance Scalable Vectors; a set of paratechnological devices that allow the localization of both anomalous and non-anomalous objectives and the identification of its mass, volume and rough shape through the emission of thaumic pulses. [[/footnote]] Units were implemented on Site-27, an unknown mass with irregular shape was detected below Wake Island. Research on the area revealed that it was a giant blackish crystal located under Wake Island, and was classified as SCP-5164-B.

SCP-5164-B is currently immovable, and it has been documented that grows ~0.3in every time an SCP-5164-A instance is destroyed by external forces. SCP-5164-B is capable of causing clinical death on living organisms upon contact by unknown means; any attempt to reanimate the affected subjects will fail. Because of these anomalous qualities, a special container designed to contain SCP-5164-B was placed around it, and will be inspected monthly in order to find cracks or damage. If they are, the container will be quickly repaired and reinforced.

There have been reports of smaller SCP-5164-B-like crystals appearing in multiple parts of the world. It is believed that they may be created by exposing the dust of SCP-5164-A instances to multiple factors that have not yet been fully identified. Additional protocols are still under management and review.
