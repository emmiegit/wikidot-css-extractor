**Item #:** SCP-2219

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2219 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-59. As of 4/29/15, testing of SCP-2219 is to be carried out using a specialized remote analog proxy and a camera on a Game Boy system. Direct human testing is prohibited.

Though SCP-2219 is believed to be unique, any copies discovered of SCP-2219 are to be seized by the Foundation immediately.

**Description:** SCP-2219 is an unlicensed Game Boy game titled &#34;PORRIDGE&#34; created by the [[[SCP-2803|Totleigh Software Corporation]]],[[footnote]] Stylized as TotleighSoft [[/footnote]] where the main character &#34;GOLDOX&#34; must progress through levels and defeat bear-themed enemies. Apparently designed as a platforming-style adventure revolving around the story of &#34;Goldilocks and the Three Bears&#34;, SCP-2219 comes without clear instructions and is subject to ambiguous gameplay goals and various glitches.

In the place of an instruction manual is a singular note reading the following:
&gt; Imersive 5D game EXPERIENTS!
&gt; 
&gt; GOLDOX is come to BÄRHAUS. Danger muchly. Usurp BÄRTHRONE and pregnate BÄRPRINCESS and conquer BÄRPEOPL. Unwanted? Haw! It begin. Depress START to Levesque. PROVE YOU WROTH!
&gt; 
&gt; **A words of CAUSHING: 5D feature doing much, failure is testamint to an WEAK UNDESERVING sort LEPERKIND. INCOMPETENCE will be PENALIZED this is necessary. You AGREE. Good.**

SCP-2219&#39;s anomalous qualities surface during gameplay. Different outcomes of gameplay result in either positive or negative responses on a human player&#39;s body, as revealed through testing on D-class subjects. This is likely the &#34;fifth dimension&#34; of gameplay mentioned in the note.
||~ In-Game Situation ||~ Effect on Player ||
|| GOLDOX collects 100 Porridge. || Player experiences a sense of induced relaxation and contentment, consistent with light sedatives. ||
|| GOLDOX collects 500 Porridge. || Instantaneous orgasm. ||
|| GOLDOX fails to collect at least 25 Porridge by the end of a level. || Light seizure. ||
|| GOLDOX loses a life. || Throat severely inflamed for five minutes; breathing made difficult. ||
|| GOLDOX loses all lives; game over. || Player contracts leprosy. ||
|| GOLDOX loses a life to the level 5 boss, &#34;PAPAPA&#34;. || Instantaneous, rapid tooth rot. ||
|| GOLDOX loses a life to the level 7 boss, &#34;MAMAMA&#34;. || Permanent blindness. ||
|| GOLDOX loses a life to the final boss, &#34;DAGRON&#34;. || Cardiac arrest. ||
|| Final boss defeated. || Unknown - outcome yet to be achieved.||

**Addendum:** SCP-2219 was recovered from the home of Jacob Nagle in Lombard, IL after several leads on Reddit.com regarding &#34;a game that gives you leprosy&#34;. Nagle was in the severe stages of leprosy and had foregone treatment out of his obsession to complete the game.

&gt; **Interviewed:** Jacob Nagle
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Isaiah Henderson
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;Begin Log&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Henderson:** Good morning, Mr. Nagle. I hope your treatments are going well.
&gt; 
&gt; **Nagle:** I need to play PORRIDGE again.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Henderson:** May I ask why?
&gt; 
&gt; **Nagle:** If I tell you, will you let me play it again?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Henderson:** I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s not possible. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Nagle:** Damn. Of course it isn&#39;t. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Henderson:** Do you feel a psychological compulsion to play PORRIDGE?
&gt; 
&gt; **Nagle:** Do I look mental or something? If you knew what was coming after the final boss, you&#39;d want to play it too. It&#39;s not even supposed to be a game, it&#39;s a way to weed out the unworthy. I saw the one guy that beat the game. Just to look at him, the light coming out of his eyes, it was--
&gt; 
&gt; [Nagle hesitates]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Henderson:** Go on.
&gt; 
&gt; **Nagle:** Yeah, nice try. You white-collar shitstains would keep it all for yourselves.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;End Log&gt;
