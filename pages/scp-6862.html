+++ **ODDITY’S DESIGNATION:**  
[[/=]]

Until the threat is properly subdued, Confederate General Officer Earl Crane has been designated as ASCI-6862. In the case Earl Crane peacefully surrenders, or is permanently neutralized, this designation will be removed.

[[=]]
+++ **DESCRIPTION OF THE ODDITY:**
[[/=]]

ASCI-6862 is a powerful necromancer and spiritist currently based in the State of Georgia. ASCI-6862 has proven itself loyal to the Rebel States through many years of servitude towards the Confederate Government, and is as such a great threat towards our Union.

ASCI-6862 is a descendant of 16th century English pilgrims, and a native of Clark County Virginia, in the Shenandoah Valley. While before the war the oddity also claimed to be a descendant of Pocahontas, the veracity of this has yet to be proven. It is also likely that this background is fictitious, the oddity instead having lived significantly longer than claimed.

Earl Crane had been, prior to the Southern Treason, a successful planter in his home region of Western Virginia, owning many acres of land throughout The South and being in the ownership of one of the largest slave populations in North America. Due to his wealth, and the age of his family, ASCI-6862 was also a highly influential figure in Virginia’s Southern Democratic Party. Like many other members of the Southern Aristocracy, ASCI-6862 fought under the Union banner in the Mexican War, and gained further military experience in the conflicts against the Indians, experience which he has employed against the Union armies throughout the war.

&gt; I’m of the opinion that the conflict in the west, against the foul Indian and Mexican, is the most glorious of wars, as the mighty and clever character of our people is proven without shedding more southern lives than necessary. 
&gt; 
&gt;  ASCI-6862, 1848.

ASCI-6862’s paranormal characteristics were confirmed following his initial death during the 2nd Battle of Bull Run, as his body would resurrect after the engagement’s end. Ever since this initial incident ASCI-6862 has made little effort to hide his necromantic abilities, increasing the numbers of the the Army of Tennessee with the recently deceased (commonly referred to as ghouls), and as such difficulting the actions of the Military Division of the Mississippi greatly. These men aren’t especially effective fighters, but their numbers and inability to feel fear or pains allows them to overwhelm unprotected positions with rifle fire and aggressive infantry charges.

The number of ghouls has been measured to reach 20 thousand men, with some estimates claiming 40 thousand troops instead; these numbers are known to be slowly increasing and have been assigned to their own unit, the 4th corps of the Army of Tennessee. These ghouls have consistently proven to be loyal to ASCI-6862, regardless of any previous affiliation or belief, as such it is thought that the ghouls lack both a soul and free will. Furthermore these ghouls have proven especially vulnerable to ignition.

Beyond the crimes of insurrection, ASCI-6862 is also guilty of destruction of United State citizens’ property, destruction of Federal Property, unlicensed usage of magic and of kidnapping of free union men; shackling the victims of his attacks into slavery.

&gt; The constitutions of our states confers the rights of our people to freely engage in the institution of slavery. As such the constant attacks on it committed by the Yankees should have always been treated as a declaration of war. Peace cannot happen until we gain independence from the northern tyrants.
&gt; 
&gt; ASCI-6862 during the Virginia Secession Convention.

For these reasons [[[scp-6861| President Abraham Lincoln]]] has given the American Secure Containment Initiative full permission to deal with the oddity with whatever means considered necessary for the complete elimination of this threat to National Security and order.

[[=]]
+++ **ODDITY NEUTRALIZATION METHOD:**
[[/=]]

The primary issue when dealing with ASCI-6862 resides in the large number of men under his command. The ghouls can be killed through normal means, however their great numbers and resilience means that any unsupported attack against them will likely end in disaster. Usage of fire is advised. Once the threat of the 4th corps is properly dealt with, capturing ASCI-6862 shouldn&#39;t be significantly difficult, if he shows many signs of resistance then the oddity is allowed to be killed, as he will likely come back again.

While the ghouls under ASCI-6862 are numerous and increasing, their number is doubtful to reach more than 40.000, as ASCI-6862 has refused to reanimate slaves, or black freemen, presumably due to ideological reasons, even when circumstances would make that the logical course of action.

For the successful conduct of the Atlanta campaign 50.000 men, all in the Military Division of the Mississippi have been deployed for specific actions against ASCI-6862 in Northwestern Georgia, with 2 reserve Cavalry divisions being deployed in Eastern Tennessee, prepared to engage the enemy combatants if considered necessary. Furthermore another 50.000 union soldiers will be participating the campaign fighting the non-supernatural components of the Rebel Army.

The Union troops that are to engage the 4th Corps are mainly equipped with non-supernatural equipment, however to facilitate the elimination of the ghouls, Union spiritists have joined the ranks of the Army of the Tennessee, and one of every five of its soldiers has been fitted with incendiary equipment. Furthermore the possibility to deploy in that military theater the warbeasts gifted by the King of Siam is open if the circumstances so require it.

By request of Commanding General Ulysses S. Grant, General William T. Sherman, an ASCI agent famed for his aggressive tactics, has been given command of the Military Division. He is expected to initiate battle on May 7th.

[[=]]
+++ **OPERATIONAL RESULTS:**
[[/=]]

After several months of campaigns by Union troops under General Sherman, it can be concluded that the containment of ASCI-6862 has been complete. The widespread usage of incendiary weapons has proven key during the fight for Atlanta, as the ghouls were decimated by its use, multiple confederate ammunition depots were destroyed and so were a significant amount of military facilities and civilian buildings used as trenches. While many of the rebel troops escaped, those controlled by ASCI-6862 were entirely destroyed during the fires, with the oddity itself being currently under Union custody.

William T. Sherman is currently awaiting further orders in liberated Atlanta, and has requested permission to march against the vampirical stronghold in Savannah, this will likely be granted.
