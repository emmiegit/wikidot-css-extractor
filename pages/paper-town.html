I think I was born for the city. Something about it... the lights, the noise, the people... it&#39;s exhilarating. It&#39;s exciting to be able to walk outside and have a different experience every day. There&#39;s always something new to see. I guess that&#39;s why I left my hometown.

Stoneport was tiny. You couldn&#39;t even call it a town-- it was more of just a tiny little tribe, with 20 people at most. My mom was the &#39;mayor,&#39; as well as the schoolteacher, and the seamstress, and tons of other little roles. Always busy with something.

Too busy, in fact, to even take care of me. So when I left, I didn&#39;t look back. I moved to the city, got a job, and life was good.

Years later, her will arrived in the mail. She&#39;d left what little she owned to me. A few dollars... and a key.

I contemplated not going back. I didn&#39;t even remember how to get there, and when you looked up Stoneport, nothing showed up. It was like it was completely gone. Forgotten. And maybe I should have forgotten about it too.

But I didn&#39;t. I found a map-- the one I used when I left. I laughed a bit at the irony. The same thing that helped me escape would lead me back there.

Then, I got into my car, drove, and in a few hours, I was there.

The town was smaller than I remembered. Just four small buildings. The butcher&#39;s shop, the barn, a little bungalow, and... the school. Home. As I approached, I noticed a single streetlight flicker, then go out. Vines crept up the side of the barn, moss threatening to eat away at the wood. The window of the butcher&#39;s shop was broken, and inside was empty. There wasn&#39;t a soul in sight, though the footsteps going up to the bungalow told me that someone had been here recently.

Soon enough, I was at the doors of the school. It&#39;d been haphazardly locked up with a chain and a padlock, both so rusty that when I inserted the key, it felt like it was going to fall apart. After opening the door, I noticed a layer of yellow dust on my hand, which I brushed off on my pants.

I entered to see the main teaching room. The blackboard had been completely covered in chalk, with not a speck of darkness remaining. There were three upright desks, each caked in same yellow dust. Mine had been knocked over on its side, but looked completely clean.

I progressed into the back room, what had once been my mom and I&#39;s bedroom. She&#39;d replaced my bed with a sewing table, but all the needles were broken in half, resting on the table&#39;s edges. Except for her bed, the rest of the furniture was gone. I ripped the comforter off the bed and shook all of the dirt off, then reached for the pillow to do the same. There was a short yellowed note underneath it. Barely legible.

&#34;I am going to die soon. My body will not be found. I will decay here, and remain only as dust.&#34;

As I gripped the note in my hands, I barely noticed that I was walking towards the exit. I pushed the door open, tucking it into my pocket as I took a deep breath.

I got in my car, and I drove away.</textarea></pre>
