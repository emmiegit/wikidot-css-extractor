**Item #:** SCP-1751

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1751 is currently contained through suppression of knowledge surrounding it. As SCP-1751 is not a physical object, and due to its unique circumstances, it cannot be fully contained.

Protocol Vortz&#39; Obfuscation is responsible for the full suppression of all media attention to SCP-1751. Foundation agents are to be embedded in every major media outlet to monitor for evidence of SCP-1751. Foundation historians reaped from universities globally are to use their influence to suppress any chance of SCP-1751 surfacing. All textbooks which mention SCP-1751 are to be confiscated and all copies destroyed. Subsequent editions are to be edited to remove all references to SCP-1751.

Additionally, Procedure Ptolemaic Trepidation has been expanded to allow for an emergency activation system. Several Foundation low orbit installations are equipped with a mass-release version of the &#34;Ninth Circle&#34; counter-meme, to be administered globally in the event of a major containment breach. This should be considered a grace period, as &#34;Ninth Circle&#34; only delays the onset of critical symptoms of SCP-1751 exposure. In the event that knowledge of SCP-1751 becomes non-containable, Class-O amnestic application is authorized.

**Description:** SCP-1751 is a fixed point in space-time, information about which can only be perceived in Latin. SCP-1751, as it is currently understood, appears to produce this effect through a proto-memetic infohazard mechanism. Current, ongoing research has proposed that the effectiveness of a counter-meme would suggest a non-memetic source of SCP-1751&#39;s anomalous effects, though the method through which SCP-1751 manifests is poorly understood.

Specifically, SCP-1751 is the entire year of ██ AD, centered around the Mediterranean Sea. During this time, no known major historical events took place, though proximity to Nero&#39;s persecution of early Abrahamic sects has been noted. Foundation historians have put forward the idea that SCP-1751 is somehow related to the burned [REDACTED] and the aftermath thereof, based on several writings in Foundation custody recovered from the remnants of the Library of Alexandria and analysis of the Dead Sea Scrolls. See Excerpt 1751-a5-Delta for a relevant section from the recovered documents.

When considered by any sapient, language capable organism[[footnote]]Testing with sapient, non-human subjects has yielded similar results.[[/footnote]], their thought processes invariably translate into Latin whenever SCP-1751 is directly thought about. This presents in the same manner as non-anomalous multi-lingual perception; the subject appears to think in Latin whenever directly or indirectly thinking about SCP-1751. The effects of SCP-1751&#39;s manipulation of thought processes have included nausea, headache, loss of focus, and difficulty communicating, though these symptoms are considered a product of the subject spontaneously experiencing a Class-Sigma shift in perception, and not an additional manifestation of SCP-1751.

Prolonged exposure to SCP-1751 has resulted in the degradation of Wernicke&#39;s area in the cerebral cortex, resulting in a cessation of understanding of all language except for Latin, and a complete inability to understand language in the long term. In extreme cases, tumor growth has been observed in patients with extended exposure to SCP-1751[[footnote]]In the cases of non-human, long term test subjects, varying amounts of damage and rapidity of cell death were observed, likely based on incompatibility with human linguistic structures.[[/footnote]]. It is theorized that SCP-1751 rapidly deconstructs and then rebuilds neuron connections within the language centers of the human brain. Additionally, subjects who have pre-existing knowledge of the Latin language have suffered decreased symptoms in relation to their level of fluency.

Due to the fact that SCP-1751 appears to be an infohazard infection of a specific point in space-time, and not simply text or some other human construct, containment of SCP-1751 has revolved around the suppression of public knowledge of it. Any sapient[[footnote]]All subsequent sapient test subjects have shown 0% resistance to SCP-1751. It is not currently believed that any organism is by nature exempted from this.[[/footnote]] organism which considers SCP-1751 will experience its anomalous effects, regardless of location, intelligence level, local temporal anchor point, or otherwise. As such, all textbooks[[footnote]]Five separate text books as of 2014.[[/footnote]] which include SCP-1751 have been confiscated and their subsequent editions edited. Suppression of knowledge regarding SCP-1751 and a deliberate disinformation campaign have served to reduce public attention of SCP-1751&#39;s specific point in time to null values. SCP-1751 presents the danger of a GH-class &#34;dead greenhouse&#34; scenario where only the most remote, media-inaccessible portions of humanity would survive. Small scale containment breaches have been obscured in the past through acute carcinogen application and counter-intelligence operations.

**Addendum 1751-009-a56:**

&gt; **Interviewed:** D-493905
&gt;  
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Malfec
&gt;  
&gt; **Foreword:** Interview with D-493905 after approximately seven (7) hours of exposure to SCP-1751. D-493905 has displayed the inability to speak in any language but Latin for two (2) hours. Bold text indicated speech in English, all other speech is in Latin.
&gt;  
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log, 1200:30:18 GMT on ██/██/████&gt;**
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Malfec:** **Please state your internal identification designation.**
&gt;  
&gt; **D-493905:** D-493905
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Malfec:** You&#39;ve been exposed to SCP-1751 a cumulative three hours now. How do you feel?
&gt;  
&gt; **D-493905:** Can I go back to my room yet?
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Malfec:** Please answer the question.
&gt;  
&gt; **D-493905:** My head is pounding and I haven&#39;t been able to keep anything down. Happy? Can I go?
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Malfec:** **Please read from this excerpt, D-493905.**
&gt; 
&gt; //At this point, Dr. Malfec slides a copy of Lewis Carroll&#39;s poem Jabberwocky across the table to D-493905, who recites it in Latin. Words not currently recognized in English are translated clearly and without pause by D-493905.//
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Malfec:** //(To camera)// Subject appears incapable of even reciting in English. In addition, SCP-1751&#39;s effects do not appear to be contingent on individual language constructs such as inappropriate words.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Malfec:** D-493905, how do you feel about working with SCP-1751?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-493905:** I can&#39;t stop thinking about it. The more I think about it the more my head pounds, doc[[footnote]]Note: Translation of abbreviated words and colloquialisms with no known Latin equivalent are spoken as if unabbreviated or translated to the best approximate representation, when affected by SCP-1751&#39;s anomalous effects.[[/footnote]]. But I don&#39;t really mind it, I suppose. Better&#39;n some of the other things I&#39;ve seen around here. Can I go now?
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Malfec:** Very well, please report at 0800 tomorrow for routine testing.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log, 1200:35:47 GMT&gt;**
&gt;  
&gt; **Closing Statement:** It has been theorized that due to the unique nature of D-class personnel&#39;s environment, it is difficult for them to separate themselves from being a test subject, which causes continual thought of the project they are involved with. Due to D-493905&#39;s continual consideration of SCP-1751, his condition has worsened more rapidly than expected, and he is unable to speak in any language except Latin. Additionally, SCP-1751 was discovered to be non-reliant on publicly decided language structures, even affecting Carroll&#39;s Jabberwocky, which contains many invented words.

**Addendum 1751-033-o65:**

&gt; **Interviewed:** D-493905
&gt;  
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Malfec
&gt;  
&gt; **Foreword:** D-493905 has been exposed to SCP-1751 for a total of forty-seven (47) cumulative hours. Despite his early, rapid onset of symptoms, he has proven unusually resistant to complete axiomatic decomposition due to SCP-1751&#39;s anomalous effects, which has made him an invaluable research asset. No other test subject has survived more than thirty (30) hours.
&gt;  
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log, 1421:25:38 GMT ██/██/████&gt;**
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Malfec:** How are you feeling, D-493905?
&gt;  
&gt; //D-493905 grunts, he is holding his head.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Malfec:** We&#39;ve prescribed you pain medication. Is it not effective?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-493905:** They stopped working.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Malfec:** Has the pain intensified?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-493905:** Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Malfec:** Is that your only new symptom?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-493905:** I&#39;ve had bad dreams.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Malfec:** What? Can you elaborate?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-493905:** I&#39;ve been having nightmares. Mostly of burning to death, always in some ancient lookin&#39; place. Pillars and torches.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Malfec:** We&#39;ll prescribe some heavy sleep medication. Is that all or- D-493905? Are you alright? D-493905?
&gt; 
&gt; //At this point, D-493905 appears to convulse in a manner consistent with a grand mal seizure.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-493905:** Amabo te nisi incendias me.
&gt; 
&gt; //Following his final vocalization, D-493905 continued to convulse and scream for four minutes and seventeen seconds before dying. Autopsy revealed damage consistent with SCP-1751 symptoms as well as evidence of a very large burst aneurysm within Wernicke&#39;s area of his brain.//
&gt;  
&gt; **&lt;End Log, 1425:34:27 GMT&gt;**
&gt;  
&gt; **Closing Statement:** All attempts to include a translation of D-493905&#39;s final words with SCP-1751&#39;s documentation have resulted in failure, due to SCP-1751&#39;s anomalous effects translating the excerpt, even through the implemented counter-memetic &#34;Ninth Circle&#34;. In all cases, as soon as an isolated translation is linked in any way to SCP-1751 it invariably becomes inexpressible in any language except for Latin. No personnel with knowledge of SCP-1751 are known to be able to understand its meaning.

**Excerpt 1751-a5-Delta:**
&gt; ...
&gt; And the gypsy woman cried to her gods,
&gt; To save her burned kin, her children,
&gt; Bubbling at her feet.
&gt; But man hath no ire like the gods,
&gt; Who took offense with her, her weakness,
&gt; Took it as an affront.
&gt; And, in their vanity, their splitting grins,
&gt; They damned her shame to the everflows of time,
&gt; And snatched her dying breath, nailing it to
&gt; That maleficent clock, so that all of man
&gt; Might remember, understand, 
&gt; and revel in her pain.
