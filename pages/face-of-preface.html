Oh dissipated fallen leaves,
He walked in a gloomy future.
Soaked by his footsteps,
Are obliviated past and present.

Oh dissipated fallen leaves,
He travelled between the pendulums of Sun and Moon.
Wished by his exhausted muscles,
Are passing through the blankness of the dawn. 

Oh dissipated fallen leaves,
He passed profane villages.
Disdained by his sight,
Are cursed gears and flesh.

Oh dissipated fallen leaves,
He stepped over the corpse of the old world.
Remembered by the balderdash of the remaining bones,
Are perseverance of the Jailors and ingenious of the madders.

Oh dissipated fallen leaves,
He recorded the stranges along his path.
Humming a song known to no one:
“The existing are false, but the passed are immortal.”

%%title%%,
Oh my dearest sapling, 
The nameless song would be my self-defence. 
May you gain insight at the trunk of the Ashen Tree.
May the Moth of Ignorance never linger around you.
