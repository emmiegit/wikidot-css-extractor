++ Additional Information
[[/=]]
Site-11 is a large-scale Foundation facility located in the mid-western United States consisting of an entire self-sustaining community including residential housing, commercial businesses, and industrial/manufacturing facilities as well as an extensive underground containment and research complex. The Foundation maintains strict tracking of all personnel and civilians within Site-11 and as such, the facility is often used as a safe location for personnel requiring additional security and protection.

Due to the number of commercial businesses and large scale manufacturing complexes, the SCP Foundation has taken to hiring local civilians to assist in running shell companies as well as to aid in manufacturing and assembly lines. Civilians under the Foundation’s employ are to be treated as level 0.

Site-11 is outfitted to handle and maintain anomalous entities of Object-Class: Keter and below. However, due to Site-11&#39;s primary objective of researching and manufacturing, Site-11 does not serve as a main containment facility. Instead, Site-11 serves as temporary housing for anomalous entities and objects.

Junior Researcher Hernandez was transferred over to Site-11 to help maintain effective production levels. Hernandez was set up in one of the apartment complexes at Site-11 for the duration of their transfer.
&gt; **Date of Containment:** September 15, 2019
&gt; **Duration of Stay:** 40 days.
&gt; **Notes:** Please see Incidence Log #23D for further information.

++ Notable Incidence Log.
[[/=]]

&gt; **Date:** December 9, 1941
&gt; **Incident #:** 12A
&gt; **Description of Events:** Due to a sudden increase in civilian manufacturing orders as well as an increase in difficulties retrieving raw materials, scheduled manufacturing for Foundation equipment and vehicles had been brought to a standstill.
&gt; **Duration of Incident:** 5 weeks.
&gt; **Additional Notes:** Site-11 was able to secure a supply line of raw materials for manufacturing through the use of contracts with third party organizations. Manufacturing was slowed for the duration of the war.

&gt; **Date:** March 12, 1960
&gt; **Incident #:** 86A
&gt; **Description of Events:** A minor tremor was felt at ‘Capital Region International Airport’. The direct cause of the tremor was an explosion of an experimental jet engine under the project: “Ducks-Fly-Too”. Three Foundation engineers were killed in the blast, eight were wounded and brought to the Medical Ward in Section-C. A Foundation Public Incidence Team was able to brush off the tremor as ‘Nothing worth noting’. Amnestic treatment was given to members of the press that tried to dig too deep into the incident.
&gt; **Duration of Incident:** 2 days.
&gt; **Additional Notes:** Project “Ducks-Fly-Too” was postponed till April 20, 1960.

&gt; **Date:** June 26, 2010
&gt; **Incident #:** 8B
&gt; **Description of Events:** Reports of a figure in an old fashioned suit and top hat that appeared within the confines of ‘Restricted Section-C’ of Site-11. The figure was reported to run ‘sporadically’ down the hallways, dropping strips of gold paper similar to typical tickets[[footnote]]Concert, carnival, or raffle ticket.[[/footnote]] with a red stamp on one side with written texts:
&gt;  
&gt; “Press here for access to Stacker&#39;s Coffeehouse and Bar!”
&gt;
&gt; The figure vanished after seemingly ripping one of the tickets, once they were confronted by Site security.
&gt; **Duration of Incident:** 6 minutes.
&gt; **Additional Notes:** Similar events have occurred at Site-17, Site-27, Site-34, and Site-88. All instances of the golden strips have been taken to Site-27 after thaumaturgic properties were discovered.

&gt; **Date:** October 15, 2017
&gt; **Incident #:** 29C
&gt; **Description of Events:** Security personnel apprehended  //Agent Gallagher// after alarms were sounded on Floor-11 of Section-C: ‘Keter Class Containment Facility’. //Agent Gallagher// was found stumbling around towards the ‘100meter Safe Zone’ of SCP-953&#39;s temporary holding cell.
&gt; **Duration of Incident:** 2 minutes.
&gt;  **Additional Notes:** Agent Gallagher was found to be intoxicated while on shift at the time. After sobering up in a holding cell, Agent Gallagher was promptly terminated from his position, given amnestic treatment, and demoted to Class-D for three weeks, given the identification code:D-101517.

&gt; **Date:** October 29, 2017
&gt; **Incident #:** 30C
&gt; **Description of Events:** D-Class D-101517, while stationed as a clerk at Foundation operated ‘Dollar General’, broke into the liquor cabinet and proceeded to get intoxicated while on shift, without management knowledge. The situation was brought to management&#39;s attention once D-101517 started to insult civilian customers.
&gt; **Duration of Incident:** 45 minutes.
&gt; **Additional Notes:** D-101517&#39;s period of demotion was increased from three weeks to three months.


&gt; **Date:** September 15, 2019
&gt; **Incident #:** 23D
&gt; **Description of Events:** 90% of the ‘Civilian Manufacturing Staff’ had to be laid off due to a lack of civilian orders from the automotive company ‘General Motors’. The sudden decrease of orders was a result of a 48,000 person walkout, organized by the ‘United Automobile Workers Union’. The sudden lack of civilian production saw a sizable decrease in Site-11 fundings for the duration of the strike.
&gt; **Duration of Incident:** 40 days.
