**Description:** SCP-5723 refers to the sudden disappearance of O5-1 on September 8th, 2019. The exact cause or reason for O5-1&#39;s disappearance is currently unknown, and a Top-Priority investigation is currently being conducted by the Overseer Council to find the whereabouts of O5-1 and the culprit, if there is one.

**History:** On September 8th, 2019, an O5 Council Summit was held. All parties were registered as having attended, save for O5-1, whose presence wasn&#39;t detected at the meeting. After waiting an hour for O5-1 to appear, the remaining twelve Overseers dispatched units from MTF Alpha-1 (&#34;Red Right Hand&#34;) and STF Alpha-0 (&#34;Backstreet Boys&#34;) to their physical and spiritual residence. O5-1&#39;s spiritual residence was noted to have completely deteriorated, with trace amounts of an unidentifiable concept. Their physical residence, on the other hand, showed signs of a break-in, with most of the windows and furniture being broken or otherwise damaged. No evidence pointing towards the identity of the malefactor was found, and the reason why the building&#39;s security systems did not activate is also unknown.

As of writing,[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]%%updated_at|%Y/%m/%d%%.[[/span]] O5-1 is still considered missing, and no information has been found on their current location and status. Until O5-1 is found and safely recovered, the Ethics Committee is to take on the role of Acting O5-1.

**Addendum 5723.1 Video Log:** On September 8th, 2049, the 30th Anniversary of SCP-5723, a video log was received by O5-3 from O5-1&#39;s Personnel Identification Chip, alongside two files titled &#34;README.md&#34; and &#34;hi.jpg&#34;. The log was dated as September 5th, 2019, but a location could not be located. Following is a transcript of the video log:

&gt; **Foreword:** The following video was recorded from O5-1&#39;s PIC. As such, it is from the point of view of O5-1. How O5-1 was moved from a spectral to a physical form to allow use of the PDI and actions taken in this video log are unknown.

Upon viewing the above log, O5-2 revealed that she had been the one to introduce O5-1 to pirating. Due to this, O5-2 has been placed under high security, with a majority of MTF Alpha-1 assigned to safeguarding her and her location. O5-1 was declared KIA, and the Foundation is currently undergoing the process of promoting a new Council Member to take their spot. The location of the video log is still unknown, as are the whereabouts of the entities depicted within it.

**Addendum 5723.2 Follow-Up:** Following the retrieval of the video log, a message was sent to Frankfort Animation Company[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]A previously popular animation company founded in the late 1910s, Frankfort has only recently resurfaced in the industry, having returned from a sixty-year long hiatus. Of note is that the Foundation contained no records of such a company until the retrieval of the above log. A full-scale operation is currently being done to investigate the nature of Frankfort Animation, and their relation to the log.[[/span]], inquiring about the contents of it.

Julie,

The O5 Council has recently received a video log from a high-level staff, who is currently considered missing, wherein they were kidnapped and brutally assaulted by an entity resembling your mascot. We would wish to inquire on any possible connections this entity has to your company, and if we need to take action in regards to this.

Likewise, we would wish to inquire on the legitimacy of this &#34;RATOPTICON.&#34;

My Dearest Heiden,

I have no idea what type of snuff film you just sent me, but, and pardon my French, what the actual fuck. Never in my 30 years of working with this company have I ever heard tell of a part of this company that partakes in such cruel acts of violence, especially against such an esteemed organization as your own.

Although the way they did it may have been a bit.. harsh, I&#39;d like to say that it was more than justified. Our animators work tirelessly in our studios to produce such fine products for you to enjoy. I believe we deserve just a little compensation for that.

Regardless, I&#39;ve added the Board of Directors to this email. Some of the people on this board have been here for ages. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll have better answers than I do.

Sincerely,
Julia Dale

Ignore this. Forget this. Forget this person. It has Joe&#39;s writing all over it. This isn&#39;t the first time this has happened. This shouldn&#39;t have happened again.
