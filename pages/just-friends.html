Maybe we can be just friends
I’d love be just friends
Just friends, you and me
Just friendship

I’ll be your friend
You’ll be my friend
Boy friend
Boyfriend

No, I don’t want
At least I pretend
Pretend that I don’t want
don’t want you as a boyfriend

I want you as my boyfriend
I want you to end with him
I’m a narcissist,
I’m materialist

I want you as my boyfriend
I’d love to be your boyfriend
Not just friends, you and me
Not just friendship

I’ll be your boyfriend
You’ll be my boyfriend
Boyfriend
Friend

But I like him too
He’s my friend too
I want him to be happy
Happier, happier than me

He’s my friend
I want to be a good friend
I want the better to him
Even if it means…

Even if it means you
Being with you
Touching you
Loving you

It shouldn’t matter
But it matters
I want to be happy
I want him to be happy

I want him as my friend
I love him as a friend
Just friends, him and me
Best friends

Some say that
We could be togheter
Him, you, me
No, I don’t want that

You don’t want that
He doesn’t want that
I want you
You want him

And it is ok
Isn’t it?
Just friend
Him, you, me.

Maybe we can be just friends
I’d love be just friends
Just friends, you and me
Just friendship
