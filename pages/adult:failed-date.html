&#34;How many dates is this our first?&#34; Kondraki, in the door, asked softly.

&#34;Fourth.&#34; Clef replied briefly, standing outside the door. He thought for a moment and decided to knock on the door again.

&#34;Konny, open the door for me, quick.&#34; Clef called in a low voice.

Kondraki&#39;s voice remained calm, &#34;Believe me dear, there&#39;s nothing worse than what&#39;s going on right now, you don&#39;t want to come in. But-if you do want to, there&#39;s a spare key under the doormat.&#34;

//Fart.// Clef thought to himself, //What could be worse than two guys running down the street naked with water bottles stuck on their ding-dongs. He&#39;s stonewalling me.//

&#34;I&#39;ll open the door.&#34; Clef replied.

The door opened and Clef saw his boyfriend with his back to him, sitting motionless in a chair facing the window.

&#34;Oh gosh, put the door on first.&#34; Kondraki was a little anxious, &#34;Alto, don&#39;t come over here yet, although I really want to get up. But I&#39;m thinking about a serious matter right now.&#34;

//He doesn&#39;t want to go out with me, fuck that.// Clef stands still, //In a minute I&#39;m going to force him to put on a fluorescent green ukiyo-e condom or I&#39;m going to choke his spongy body off.//

&#34;Alto, I feel like everything is a closed loop, everything is circular. You, me, Site-17, Draven, SCP-682, Bright, Gears, all of these have their circular necessity. Everything will return to its original position after an infinite period of motion. Just like the big river running endlessly into people&#39;s cups of water, turning into a bubble of urine before entering the sewer and being discharged into the river, this is a perfect closed loop. Everything else can be explained by this closed loop. The plastic-pure water bottle came to me after numerous processes, and I believe that some force manipulated it.&#34; Kondraki is serious as hell.

//[[[just-fuck-it-up-irl| He must have gotten the damn water bottle stuck in his dick again.]]]// Clef thought desperately, //I&#39;m going to go blow away all the owners of manufacturers who sell bottled water with a single shot, yes, one by one with a god damn shotgun from the temple.//

There was a breathless silence, and Kondraki spoke once more, with a faint melancholy, &#34;Resistance is unnecessary, for all items will eventually fall into place and return to their rightful place. alto, if you&#39;re ready, come on over.&#34;

Clef strides forward, over the Tenga jumpers on the floor, the sea of empty mineral water bottles, the dry, hard waffles, to reach his lover&#39;s side. In the first second, he saw Kondraki&#39;s face a deadly gray; in the second, he saw the old supervisor&#39;s clothes all open; in the third, he saw the huge cylinder.

//Silence.//

Alto Clef let out the most gruesome moan he had ever heard in his life.

&#34;Konny, how the fuck do you shove a fucking dick in a fucking **//Big! Bucket! Water!//**&#34;
------

Clef leaned back on the couch, holding his head in his hands. His worldview was crumbling, a position he maintained when he saw his old cohort, old friend, old partner, and new lover stuffing his penis into a bucket of water and still jamming it. He begins to suspect that the world is all a sham and that the real god of mankind is the god of pure water and music, who sows plastic bottles into every corner of the world. Clef would prefer to take an acid bath with 682, at least for the time being.

&#34;Alto, it&#39;s like I just said.&#34; Kondraki was shy as a virgin, even though he was almost sixty, &#34;I didn&#39;t think the vat was as easy to jam, but the size was a little big, so I did a little personal modification and made the mouth of the barrel thinner-&#34;

Clef roared again, &#34;Pure Water Le has never produced a vat of water! Where the fuck did you get that from!&#34;

Kondraki got even more shy, &#34;I went to a foundation front company that&#39;s a Pure Water Music fabricator, and I had them make me a custom one...&#34;

&#34;Okay.&#34; Clef accepted reality, &#34;I&#39;ll get this damn bucket off for you, and then we&#39;ll go on a date. Can I just cut it off for you--&#34;

Kondraki grabbed the dinner knife on the table beside her.

&#34;Hey Konny I&#39;ll just be kidding put your knife down and I&#39;ll help you cut the body of the bucket off first and then take the spout off the bottle.&#34; Clef grabbed a scalpel from another table and meticulously cut around the cross section of the vat of water. The bulk of the bucket was cut off.

&#34;Wow, this looks really bad. Your cock looks like a purebred sausage dog wearing a ring of shame.&#34; Clef teased.

&#34;Alto, I swear, you say one more fucking word and I&#39;ll shove your glans down your throat and take a tattoo knife and tattoo your foreskin.&#34; Kondraki growled.

That worked a little, at least Clef quieted down. He cut off all the blue part of the bucket and was left with the white spout that had been modified by Kondraki and tightened around his penis. So Clef decided to fight a pull.

+++ &#34;Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh-&#34;

&#34;Konny what are you freaking out about?&#34; Clef grunted as he didn&#39;t succeed in ripping the bottle off.

&#34;You&#39;ll get a bloody broken dick attached to it in addition to that damn white bottle top if you use any more force.&#34; Kondraki gasped, &#34;Isn&#39;t there any other way?&#34;

Clef pondered for a moment, longer than any other time in the past. Thank God, he figured out something else.

&#34;Are there any other circle-shaped objects in your house?&#34; Clef&#39;s eyes flickered.

&#34;What do you want?&#34; Kondraki asked warily.

&#34;Put another one on, then the original one will be disintegrated from engorgement, and take the new one off, it&#39;s called fighting poison with poison.&#34; Clef smiled confidently.

Site-17&#39;s infirmary enjoyed a rare moment of relaxation as physician Zikmess sipped tea leisurely.

A head poked in through the door, &#34;Hello, is anyone there?&#34;

&#34;Dr. Kondraki, please come in.&#34; , Zikimess&#39;s heart twitched as he remembered the horror stories his predecessor had told him. Fortunately-Today Dr. Kondraki&#39;s crotch was not abnormally bulging.

&#34;I&#39;ve come for two things.&#34; Kondraki said solemnly, &#34;The first thing-&#34; He pulled down his own pants.

Zikmess felt time stand still; he would have preferred it to go backwards, crumpled into a dried-up apple core. &#34;Dear Dr. Kondraki.&#34; Zikmess adjusted himself, &#34;Why do you need two penis rings on your genitals?

&#34;That&#39;s not the point.&#34; Kondraki grimaced, &#34;First, I want you to help me take these two things off. As for the reason you ask, that&#39;s exactly the second thing I came here for.&#34; He pulled his pants up and pulled a man in through the door. zikmess let out a scream.

&#34;Dr. Kondraki, why is Dr. Clef with a mangled bucket stuck on his head?&#34; Zikmess asked with a shudder.

&#34;He seems to have fallen over.&#34; Kondraki replied.

&#34;Then why are his clothes torn and tattered?&#34;

&#34;Probably he fell in a thorn bush.&#34;

&#34;Why is there a shoe print on his chest?&#34;

&#34;Maybe a pair of leather boots fell from the third floor.&#34;

&#34;One last question.&#34; Zikmess took a deep breath, &#34;How many bones did he break from the beating-fall?&#34;

&#34;Not a single one, I think that&#39;s the only thing I&#39;m sure of.&#34; Kondraki grinned, holding his trouser belt in one hand.</textarea></pre>
