**Item #:** SCP-5370

**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** Problems based on the ruleset and active configurations of SCP-5370 have been provided to leading mathematical organisations in order to identify potential candidates for BLUE TEAM membership. BLUE TEAM candidates should:

* possess a high-level understanding of the field of transfinite game theory and modern chess strategy
* be fully certified in diplomatic negotiation with anomalous entities and basic grief counselling
* undergo the mandatory psychiatric evaluation necessary to participate in assignments with a &gt;95% candidate mortality rate.

Presently, interaction with SCP-5370 is suspended pending the development of a gameplay strategy approved by both Overwatch Command and the Ethics Committee.

**Description:** SCP-5370 is an ongoing, anomalous game of fairy chess[[footnote]]A term used to refer to variants of chess with altered rules.[[/footnote]] between two parties: BLUE TEAM, a task force of Foundation mathematicians, and RED TEAM, [RESTRICTED TO 5370/BLUE TEAM CLEARANCE]. SCP-5370&#39;s ruleset was initially devised by the Foundation in 1977, and the game started six years later on the 4th of January, 1983.

A summary of the most important deviations between the rules of SCP-5370 and FIDE chess is provided below:

* SCP-5370 is played on an infinite grid simulated on computer hardware, although the majority of the game&#39;s states have remained within a 110x110 space on the board.
* SCP-5370 starts with both players having 128 pieces at the start of play instead of 16, and incorporates a variety of non-standard pieces such as the huygens, which can only move any prime number of spaces diagonally.
* SCP-5370 employs a modified version of the 50-move rule: if 50 moves have passed without a piece being taken or a 1-mover[[footnote]]A piece that can only move 1 space at a time. In standard chess, this refers exclusively to the king and the pawn, but SCP-5370 adds two additional 1-movers.[[/footnote]] being moved, a stalemate is declared. The time limit on each move has additionally been increased to 10 years.

At the time of writing, BLUE TEAM has a considerable material and positional advantage over RED TEAM, and is likely to achieve mate within the next 200 moves.

SCP-5370&#39;s primary anomalous property is its ability to facilitate survivable communication with RED TEAM. Due to operational security risks, further information requires 5370/BLUE TEAM clearance to access.

**Addendum SCP-5370-A:** Prospective BLUE TEAM Strategic Overview

&gt; **Goal:** To ensure SCP-5370 continues for as long as possible.
&gt; 
&gt; **Motivations:** 
&gt; 
&gt; # Ensuring SCP-5370 continues for as long as possible allows the Foundation to get the most possible value from the information RED TEAM is capable of providing.
&gt; # Ethics Committee&#39;s applied research teams have proven that the end of SCP-5370 would have unacceptable consequences for RED TEAM due to the nature of their confinement.  
&gt; 
&gt; **Methods:**
&gt; 
&gt; # Researching the most suboptimal lines of play possible to communicate a given idea. This allows us to avoid ending the game via time-based stalemate while also preserving the ability to communicate with RED TEAM.
&gt; # Attempting to modify the rules of the game using loopholes in the rituals used to create it. Since much of the documentation around SCP-5370&#39;s creation was largely informal to minimise scrutiny, this ultimately depends on information that can only be provided by RED TEAM.
&gt; # Should RED TEAM&#39;s position continue to deteriorate, BLUE TEAM personnel may be selected to become first-hand advisors to RED TEAM pending Ethics Committee approval.

&gt; 
&gt; **AS:** —while communication is as simple as identifying the correct move to make, the difficulty is in getting coherent results. Hence the ritual apparatus you see here today. 
&gt; 
&gt; **VC:** I... see. The briefing packet didn&#39;t mention—
&gt; 
&gt; **AS:** Relax. It&#39;s not your job to do this; all you have to do is watch. Make sure I&#39;m not being too mean to them. //(to MJ)// The fishing hook, please.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-11:** I know she&#39;s new, Amitha, but I&#39;ve never seen you do this before, either. Did something change?
&gt; 
&gt; **AS:** Your man&#39;s a traitor, Eleven, which screws up the usual ways we&#39;d separate the player from the team; we can&#39;t assume the gestalt can get him to cooperate, so that means we can&#39;t just make a move and wait for the response.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-11:** Ah.
&gt; 
&gt; **AS:** So we have to imbue the move with significance, call out to him specifically. Think of RED TEAM like a bag of coins, and our volunteers here as our sorting machine. We want to pick out certain qualities from each of them—
&gt; 
&gt; [RESTRICTED TO 5370/BLUE TEAM CLEARANCE]
&gt; 
&gt; **AS:** Divorcee—

&gt; 
&gt; **AS:** —father of two—
&gt; 
&gt; [REDACTED FOR BREVITY]
&gt; 
&gt; **AS:** —not as wasteful as you&#39;d think, thankfully. Those parts of them will grow back after a while: well, maybe not the kids.
&gt; 
&gt; **VC:** Can... can I take a break now?
&gt; 
&gt; **AS:** No. There&#39;s a sick bag behind the desk.
&gt; 
&gt; **VC:** Oh.
&gt; 
&gt; **AS:** Now: the most important quality we&#39;re looking for. Betrayal.
&gt; 
&gt; //(pause)//
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-11:** That tattoo. You were Hand?
&gt; 
&gt; **AS:** Not in five minutes. //(to MJ)// Fentanyl, please?
&gt; 
&gt; [RESTRICTED TO 5370/BLUE TEAM CLEARANCE]
&gt; 
&gt; **VC:** Jesus, I&#39;ll- I&#39;ll get a tourniquet, this is—
&gt; 
&gt; **AS:** It&#39;s not blood I&#39;m bleeding. Shut up and eat the eyeball.
&gt; 
&gt; **VC:** You said I wouldn&#39;t have to do anything!
&gt; 
&gt; **AS:** When I asked you if you ate offal, did you think that was a fucking joke?
&gt; 
&gt; **VC:** I- no, but this is- this is ridiculous! I&#39;m going to—
&gt; 
&gt; **AS:** You&#39;re going to eat the eyeball, and you&#39;re going to tell me what move we make.
&gt; 
&gt; [REDACTED FOR BREVITY]
&gt; 
&gt; **VC:** —never complaining about ox tongue again—
&gt; 
&gt; **AS:** What move?
&gt; 
&gt; **VC:** //(coughs)// Bishop! Bishop, to- to a32.
&gt; 
&gt; **AS:** Noted.
&gt; 
&gt; //(pause)//
&gt; 
&gt; **VC:** Where- where&#39;s the sick bag—
&gt; 
&gt; [REDACTED FOR BREVITY]
&gt; 
&gt; **AS:** Alfil to g31. Interesting.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-11:** How many moves without a capture, now?
&gt; 
&gt; **AS:** Twenty-nine. Everyone&#39;s got plenty of pieces on the board, don&#39;t you worry.
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-11:** Mm. Still a lot emptier than I remember it.
&gt; 
&gt; **AS:** You asked us to do this, Eleven.
&gt; 
&gt; //(pause)//
&gt; 
&gt; **AS:** He says you want to see what we&#39;ve got on Reagan&#39;s [[[SCP-1514|Star Wars]]] projects, start looking through foster homes. Oh, and something about your husband: very mature, I can see why he defected.

**Addendum SCP-5370-C:** Initial Project Proposal 

&gt; +++ Introduction
&gt; 
&gt; The Foundation has an institutional knowledge problem unmatched by any other international organisation of its size. It has a fatality rate on par with several contemporary militaries[9][21], high rates of turnover in positions of authority[7], historical gaps in its record-keeping which mean information necessary to containment efforts is passed on almost exclusively by word of mouth[2][5][11]—and these are merely the issues not exclusive to our line of work. The indiscriminate nature of amnestic treatments for infohazardous contamination and the generally high prevalence of mind-affecting anomalies[19] places yet further pressure on the number of experienced employees we can retain in a functional capacity, and therefore the experience they can continue to pass down to future operatives.
&gt; 
&gt; In this proposal, we outline a method capable of making it theoretically impossible for loss of personnel to negatively impact institutional knowledge, via the creation of a location known as a &#39;blackroom&#39;. This method has several advantages over similar blackrooms previously proposed:
&gt; 
&gt; * It captures any personnel lost in the line of duty, regardless of personal beliefs or position in the Foundation&#39;s hierarchy. To prevent this much knowledge loss without requiring steps such as mass conversion[3] or a restructuring of the Foundation&#39;s org chart to a more [[[SCP-910|ritually pliable state]]][11] is a previously unsolved issue.  
&gt; * It does not encounter the so-called Inferno problem[9]. Prior attempts to solve this rendered the blackroom inaccessible to prospective inhabitants as a result of acts they performed in the line of duty. We solve this by creating a morally-neutral value space, making it both accessible and minimising the harm inflicted upon its inhabitants.
&gt; * The communication method used makes the transmission of infohazardous data much safer than by other means. Instead of using direct telepathic contact, automatic writing, and other memetically-insecure methods of communication, we use a chess-based encryption method whose output can be sanitised automatically.
&gt; 
&gt; We estimate that this project will take approximately ten years to complete, will require a budget of 7.5 million USD, and will last for approximately 260 thousand years provided judicious restrictions are placed on communicating with the blackroom.
