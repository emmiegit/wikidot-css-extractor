**Partial Schematic of SCP-7941**
[[/div]]
[[/=]]
**Item #:** SCP-7941

**Object Class:** --Thaumiel-- Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7941 has been destroyed. Due to the ongoing XK-Δ-Class &#34;Solar Singularity&#34; Scenario indirectly caused by its destruction, further containment measures are neither possible nor necessary. 

The only phone used to to speak with SCP-7941-A has been lost and is presumed destroyed. There will be no further contact.

**Description:** SCP-7941 refers to the SCPSS //Renard//, an experimental interstellar spacecraft. It was ellipsoidal in shape, 200 meters in length, and 95 meters at its widest diameter. SCP-[DATA LOST][[footnote]](&#34;Mothchild,&#34; Object Class: [DATA LOST])[[/footnote]]  had been reworked into its means of forward thrust, allowing SCP-7941 to (hypothetically) reach speeds faster than //C// while bypassing the temporal effects of relativity. There were quarters for 150 crew members, 10 officers, and 50 D-class personnel.

SCP-7941&#39;s purpose was to provide SCP-10409[[footnote]](&#34;Le Petit Prince Autre,&#34; Object Class: --Keter-- Presumed Neutralized [following the XK-Delta event])[[/footnote]] with an annual supply of 50 D-class personnel to function as tributary sacrifices through Protocol 39-Renard.

Due to SCP-10409&#39;s fixed position in the center of the inner Oort Cloud, as well as the fact that all attempts to negotiate more reasonable demands from SCP-10409 had resulted in heightened aggression toward humanity, O5 Command approved the use of anomalous means to execute Protocol 39-Renard.

In addition, to monitor the flight&#39;s progress, fifty members of SCP-7941&#39;s crew were selected to receive modified SCP-2922[[footnote]](&#34;Notes from the Under,&#34; Object class: Safe, a means of communication between a human mind and a telephone. The version used was also able to receive audio stimulus experienced by the implanted human subject.)[[/footnote]] implantation, including ten D-class. The latter were monitored discreetly, while the former maintained communication with ground control.

**Addendum - Incident-7941-ROUGE:** On 5/19/2025, ten minutes after SCP-7941 breached Earth&#39;s orbit on its maiden voyage, SCP-[DATA LOST] became self-aware within the thrust mechanism. SCP-[DATA LOST] then proceeded to email O5 Command a .txt document composed of the word &#34;SHINY&#34; repeated 4x10^^39^^ times. 

Following this, the ship&#39;s navigational computer was immediately taken over by SCP-[DATA LOST], and an irreversible crash course was set for the Sun. Oral cyanide caplets were distributed among all onboard personnel, including D-class. 

Only one member of SCP-7941&#39;s crew has survived Incident-7941-ROUGE: D-81840, Zachariah Merton Kent, a 32-year-old man of Afro-Jamaican descent. He was the seventh D-class onboard SCP-7941 to be implanted with SCP-2922. 

Following Incident-7941-ROUGE, D-81840 has become SCP-7941-A, which has **[5/7941 CLEARANCE REQUIRED]**

++++ __SCP-2922 logs with D-81804 [abridged]__

&gt; &lt;Begin Log&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; //(5/20/2025, 0539 GMT. Six minutes until SCP-7941 breaches the maximum safe distance from the sun for human survival.)//
&gt; 
&gt; //[Note: (M) refers to D-81840&#39;s inner thoughts, while (V) refers to his vocalizations. SCP-2922 is capable of picking up both, though an audible timbre shift distinguishes these voices from one another.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //(Several alarms can be heard within the cabin.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (M):** How much longer is this gonna take? Maybe I should rub one out while I still can. How many people can say they&#39;ve jerked it in zero-G? ...then again, I don&#39;t wanna //die// doing that. But it&#39;s not like anyone&#39;s gonna find out, right?
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** D-81840, come in.
&gt; 
&gt; //D-81840 yelps.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-84840 (V):** God? Is that you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** This is Dr. Sylvia Tanner of Foundation Site-59.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** Oh. Hi, Doc... are //you// God?
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** No such luck. I&#39;m reaching out to you from Ground Control.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** From the intercom?
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** I&#39;m connected to your mind.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** ...are you //sure// you&#39;re not God?
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** Stay focused. I&#39;d like to ask you a few questions.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** Sure, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve got much time to be chatty.
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** Yes, I&#39;m aware of your situation. And... I&#39;m sorry.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** Eh. Not like it&#39;ll be a boring death.
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** Scanners indicate that you&#39;re the only survivor on the //Renard//. Why didn&#39;t you take a cyanide pill?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** I thought those were optional!
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** They were. Just curious, I suppose.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** I mean... it&#39;s kinda counterintuitive. I&#39;m already about to die instantly, why add an extra step? That doesn&#39;t make sense.
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** Good point, but we thought you would have liked to take back one last piece of control from an otherwise uncontrollable situation.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** But that&#39;s the thing, Doc -- I don&#39;t want to take control.
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** Pardon?
&gt; 
&gt; //(D-81840 sighs deeply.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** ...long story. You probably got more important things to do than listen to me literally ramble to death.
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** Look, the Foundation&#39;s not above basic decency. I don&#39;t mind staying on with you until the end.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** Heh. We&#39;ll agree to disagree about whether or not I deserve it. But I&#39;ll humor you.
&gt; 
&gt; On one hand, yes, I&#39;m suicidal. Anyone who&#39;s had to listen to me whine for more than five minutes knows that. On the other, I want to //be killed//, not just die - big difference. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** What do you mean?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** Suicide is an escape. I want to be punished by some force stronger than myself. If I&#39;ve done something bad, anything bad at all, it never stops bothering me until I&#39;ve gotten my comeuppance. Like the whole rest of the world has gone a little bit wrong until I&#39;ve resolved the issue.
&gt; 
&gt; That&#39;s how it&#39;s always been for me. My parents weren&#39;t slap-happy or nothing -- I guess just the way my brain&#39;s wired.
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** And what have you done to deserve being shot into the sun?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** You get us from the prisons, right? You must have done a background check. And even if you haven&#39;t, didn&#39;t you see the news six years ago? Zack Kent? The Benbrook Lake Incident? #HeartReact4Comstock?
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** Enlighten me.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** All right, all right. Well, back in 2019, I was living in Fort Worth and doing three jobs at once just to make ends meet. Driving school buses in the morning and early afternoon, flipping burgers until 8 PM, and hauling boxes for FedEx at the airport until bedtime.
&gt;  
&gt; **Tanner:** I wasn&#39;t aware that having a hectic schedule was an unpardonable offense.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** But here&#39;s the thing. The night after Valentine&#39;s Day, I had to go overtime at the airport. Finally got home at 4:30. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** I still don&#39;t see what that has to do with... oh.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** Yeah. The school bus. I had to be at the base at 4:30 to do maintenance checks on my new engine. And at 5:30, I was picking up my first rounds of second-graders to Anthony Comstock Elementary.
&gt; 
&gt; I shotgunned a couple tallboys of Monster to keep my eyes open. It didn&#39;t do shit. It just meant I was falling asleep to the sound of a jackhammer in my ribcage. I slapped myself a couple times when that didn&#39;t work. Some first-grader with a Steven Universe backpack saw me. She came up and touched me gently on the arm. &#34;Are you okay, mister?&#34; I didn&#39;t even answer.
&gt; 
&gt; The road in front of me wasn&#39;t even a road. It was a blurry painting of hasty strokes of orange, yellow, and blue.
&gt; 
&gt; Last voice I heard that wasn&#39;t a scream was some third-grader saying Pacific Rim was gay.
&gt; 
&gt; Thump. Thump. Snap.
&gt; 
&gt; //(His breathing trembles.)//
&gt; 
&gt; ...splash.
&gt; 
&gt; By the time I came to, the bottom of my air freshener was touching the water level. A fire truck was towing us out of the lake. 
&gt; 
&gt; I look back. Twenty shades of blue are staring back at me from a pile, saying nothing. Every night when I sleep, I gotta spend two hours chasing that mental image out of my head.
&gt; 
&gt; ...My niece was on that bus. Evelyn Kent. And those 19 others, they didn&#39;t even know my name, but they trusted me.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; The judge ended up giving me 200 years for every kid. Total bullshit. I was in //Texas//, the state bird&#39;s probably the electric chair -- why didn&#39;t I get the death penalty?! 
&gt; 
&gt; And before you say that being locked up with all the guilt is punishment enough -- 1. my cell bed was surpisingly comfy, and 2. call me superstitious, but there&#39;s still an imbalance in Fort Worth&#39;s collective karma thanks to me! Bad things should never happen to good people, not without consequences. Especially not kids.
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** Um, D-81840?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** I don&#39;t care if it was manslaughter instead of murder -- no amount of legalese can explain that shit to me. I should have ignored my public defender, pled //not// guilty, represented myself, and showed no remorse. Maybe then they&#39;d have killed me and I wouldn&#39;t have to feel like an unfinished fucking math problem!
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** Mr. Kent?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** //What?!//
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** You breached what should have been the minimum lethal distance to the sun 32 seconds ago.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** ...//what.//
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** How do you feel?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** Honestly? The AC was way too low when I boarded the ship, and it still is.
&gt; 
&gt; //(24 seconds of intense rumbling and shrieking alarms.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** Um, your speed is increasing unexpectedly...
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** Well, Doc, it&#39;s been real! It takes a rare kinda heart to keep a bastard like me company.
&gt; 
&gt; //(The rumbling and alarms abruptly end.)//
&gt; 
&gt; As for me, I&#39;m gonna go off and get that final catharsis I&#39;ve been chasing for so //okay hold up why the **FUCK** am I **STILL ALIVE?!**//
&gt; 
&gt; //(CRASH.)//
&gt; 
&gt; //(He quietly hyperventilates.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** This can&#39;t be right. These readings say that you&#39;re literally inside the sun. And one of your doors just opened from the outside. ...Still chilly?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** Yeah, what the hell?
&gt; 
&gt; //(Distant footsteps in the ship.)//
&gt; 
&gt; ...try not to panic, Doc, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m alone.
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** If that&#39;s the case, I&#39;m going to need you to speak to me only with your mind until further notice. Can you manage that?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (M):** Like this?
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** Yes, exactly.
&gt; 
&gt; //(A low, wheezing voice is heard.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **[UNKNOWN]:** {{You.}}
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** Is it in the room with you? Can you see it?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (M):** I think so. It&#39;s standing on the ceiling.
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** What do you see?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (M):** ...bird...priest?
&gt; 
&gt; **[UNKNOWN]:** {{You. New resident. Unexpected.}}
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** Listen, do //not// engage it in conversation until I authorize you to --
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** Uh, yeah, hello there! My name&#39;s Zack. Do you speak English?
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** Oh, for God&#39;s sake.
&gt; 
&gt; **[UNKNOWN]:** {{Somewhat. Dictionary equals incompletion.}} 
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** Fine, but whatever you do, do NOT let them know I&#39;m talking to you.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (M):** Got it.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** Listen, could you tell me where I am? And who you are?
&gt; 
&gt; --[UNKNOWN]-- **NaUrKa:** {{Location:}} //SauEl.// {{Self:}} //NaUrKa,// {{chiefest Lifemonger.}}
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** ...did it just say &#34;Sauel?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (M):** What&#39;s important about that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** Nothing I can elaborate. But I think you&#39;re about to find out on your own. I won&#39;t always respond, but I&#39;ll keep this line open and recorded, so be sure to periodically check in with me about what you&#39;re seeing. Got that?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (M):** Might as well. I got nothing better to do.
&gt; 
&gt; **NaUrKa:** {{Come. Our castle, deathless. Receive your immortality. Eternal safety.}}
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (M):** GOD. FUCKING. **//DAMMIT!//**
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** Uh, great! When do I start?
&gt;
