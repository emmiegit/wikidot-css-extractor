**Item #:** SCP-7138

**Object Class:** Pending

**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-7138 will be stored in a non-humanoid containment room lined with mirrors. Viewing SCP-7138 should be done through those mirrors. SCP-7138 will not be interacted with on Sundays or during the first week of the month. Personnel viewing SCP-7138 directly are advised to wear rose-tinted glasses, unless you have brown eyes. All interactions with SCP-7138 must be approved and supervised by Dr. Montgomery.--

##magenta|SCP-7138 cannot be contained. It&#39;s everywhere.##

##magenta|Instead, all Foundation personnel are to render themselves incapable of seeing via the removal of any eyes or similar optical sensory organs. Those unwilling to do so will be left to their fate.##

##magenta|Blind yourself to the horror. Don&#39;t look. Don&#39;t think.##

**Description:** SCP-7138 is##magenta|n’t## a 1 square meter canvas covered in magenta paint of various shades. --Subjects exposed to SCP-7138 report heightened anxiety and aversion to the color magenta. On at least one occasion, exposure to SCP-7138 has caused subjects to remove their optical organs.--
--SCP-7138 does not emit any thaumic radiation, nor are its effects hampered by Scranton reality anchors.--

##magenta|It’s the truth. It’s what’s beneath. It’s everywhere that infernal color is.##

--The lack of any obvious anomalous aspects, combined with SCP-7138’s effects, suggests that there must be a deeper level on which SCP-7138 operates. We just can’t see past our reality to what’s underneath. We can’t see the true reality.--

##magenta|I’ve seen the truth, and it is terrifying.##

--Since its discovery, SCP-7138 has remained quiet, but sooner or later we’ll wake it up. Sooner or later we’ll wring the truth from it.--

##magenta|The horrible, awful truth.##

**Discovery:** --SCP-7138 came to the Foundation’s attention during an investigation into the deaths of several suspected members of AWCY (designated subjects 7138-A through C) during a &#34;twenty-four-hour art contest&#34;. Interviews with 7138-C indicate that they may not have intended to create SCP-7138. The fools knew not what they were doing.--

##magenta|We turned a blind eye. We saw the truth, and couldn&#39;t bear it. Generation after generation lied to themselves, until they forgot the truth entirely.##

##magenta|We disguised it with color. But it was not color.##

##magenta|But then I saw through, and I remembered. I remembered that there is no order.##

##magenta|What you see, what I thought I saw, it’s not the truth. It isn’t anything.##

After Incident 7138-1, subject 7138-E was given a psyche evaluation and deemed capable of giving an interview.
------
**Director Carl Blanden:** Alright, this is an interview with subject 7138-E, formerly known as Foundation researcher Dr. Montgomery.

**7138-E:** Huh. I&#39;ve never been on the receiving end of that. If that isn&#39;t the most dehumanizing thing, I don&#39;t know what is.

**Director Carl Blanden:** [sighs] Okay. Let’s get this over with. Let the record show that a psychological evaluation has shown that while 7138-E may be… disturbed, they are in fact in full control of their mental faculties. First question. Why did you remove your eyes?

**7138-E:** Because they were lying to me.

**Director Carl Blanden:** You mean you saw something that wasn’t there?

**7138-E:** I’m sorry?

**Director Carl Blanden:** Your eyes, they generated some kind of illusion?

**7138-E:** [chuckles] You could say that.

**Director Carl Blanden:** Alright, what did you see?

**7138-E:** I didn’t see anything.

**Director Carl Blanden:** So the SCP causes your eyes to cease functioning?

**7138-E:** No.

**Director Carl Blanden:** But you said you didn&#39;t see anything.

**7138-E:** Yes.

**Director Carl Blanden:** Why didn&#39;t you see anything?

**7138-E:** Because my eyes didn&#39;t work. They never did.

**Director Carl Blanden:** But... I know you haven&#39;t always been blind. I&#39;ve seen you read stuff, and...

**7138-E:** Oh, I just imagined that.

**Director Carl Blanden:** What?

**7138-E:** I imagined it. It was like a dream, but I was still awake. But then, when working with SCP-7138, I saw something... well, it made me realize that what I was seeing couldn&#39;t be true. I realized my eyes had to be tricking me. So I removed them.

**Director Carl Blanden:** I... I see.

**7138-E:** Do you? Or have you been fooled, like me?
