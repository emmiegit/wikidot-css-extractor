    **Item #:** SCP-493

    **Object Class:** Safe

    **Special Containment Procedures:** Instances of SCP-493 are to be kept in separate standard personnel-grade rooms with basic furnishings for a human-like SCP. Individual SCP-493 may request additional furnishings provided the request does not violate restrictions specific to that individual. Additions must be approved on a case by case basis by Level 4 personnel. SCP-493-02 and SCP-493-03 have been allowed to continue their work as Level 2 personnel; however they are not to be assigned to high risk areas in order to prevent premature duplication.

Each instance of SCP-493 is to be marked with a tattoo of their designation number on their upper right arm to prevent any confusion between the otherwise similar appearance of each individual.

    **Description:** SCP-493 is a group of genetically identical males of apparent ages between 20 and 90 years old. The younger SCP-493s have brown hair and brown eyes, are about 1.7m tall, and weigh between 70 and 90 kg, depending on diet and activity. Older SCP-493s&#39; hair turns grey after beginning to bald around an apparent age of 50 years old. Each SCP-493 currently in containment is fluent in English and multiple dialects of German, speaking with a moderate Swiss-German accent. SCP-493-07 and SCP-493-08 are also fluent in Spanish. Seven instances of SCP-493 are currently in containment. From estimated duplication rates, it is believed that a minimum of twelve instances of SCP-493 have not yet been contained.

When an instance of SCP-493 dies, nothing abnormal presents itself immediately. The corpse will decompose naturally. However approximately three hours after death, two younger SCP-493s (appearing to be in their early twenties) will materialize in close proximity to the location of death. These two new instances of SCP-493 are identical to each other, and maintain the memories of all of their previous lives.

Other than the memories of their previous life, individual instances of SCP-493 do not appear to share any sort of mental link or bond with each other after reconstitution. If the two young SCP-493s move away from each other geographically, they may lead completely separate lives.

    **Addendum:** SCP-493-01 came to the SCP Foundation in 1963 as a Level 1 researcher four years before it was known that he had unique attributes. On April ██, 1967, shortly after being given Level 2 access, SCP-493-01 was killed during a containment breach of SCP-███ at Site 19. His remains were dealt with according to standard procedure for all Level 2 personnel. Three hours and two minutes after SCP-493-01&#39;s death, several Class D personnel involved in the clean-up reported a thin mist appear in two vaguely humanoid shapes in the corridor outside SCP-███&#39;s containment chamber. Approximately half a minute later, a bright flash followed. As the flash subsided, two naked human males (SCP-493-02 and SCP-493-03) were standing in place of the mist. The pair were immediately placed in containment and then questioned.

SCP-493-02 and SCP-493-03 have divulged their origins, the accuracy of which has largely been confirmed by historical and dental records. The original SCP-493 was born in 16██ in Zürich, Switzerland, becoming a successful protestant pastor before his first death and subsequent reconstitution in 17██. SCP-493-02 and SCP-493-03 claim the recent events involving SCP-███ resulted in their fifth reconstitution to date. Details of SCP-493-01&#39;s &#34;family tree&#34; of reconstitution can be found in Document 493-H.

Containment of free SCP-493 is a work in progress. &#34;It is the Foundation&#39;s hope that the majority of SCP-493 can be contained before duplication of SCP-493 runs exponentially out of control. However, just rounding these subjects up is quite the task, it is not like we can just put a bulletin up when the people we need to find could be any age.&#34; –Dr. ████

It is unknown if SCP-493 will keep dividing with every death, but there is no reason to doubt such an occurrence. Permanent containment and termination options are currently under consideration.

**Update 493-01:** Agent ████ apprehended SCP-493-04 and SCP-493-05 in ██████, Germany on December ██, 1967. Each appears to be approximately 40 years old, the same age as SCP-493-01 before death.

**Update 493-02:** On February ██, 1976, SCP-493-06 is discovered homeless on the streets of New York City, appears to be about 30 years of age.

**Incident Report 493-A:** SCP-493-06 commits suicide. [DATA EXPUNGED] SCP-493-07 and SCP-493-08 are to be kept under close observation in quarters guarded against future suicide attempts. (██/██/1977)

**Update 493-03:** Following several heated arguments over the current political and religious status in various major nations, SCP-493-02 and SCP-493-03 have requested to be removed from duty in sectors surrounding and including containment chamber of SCP-493-05. Request denied. &#34;You&#39;re professionals, start acting like it.&#34; –Dr. ██████ (██/██/1980)

**Update 493-04:** SCP-493-02 and SCP-493-03 have repeated request to be removed from SCP-493-05, stating that regulation 36, subsection 8a states that they are &#34;Not permitted to oversee contained family members without sufficient supervision,&#34; and arguing that this regulation applies to their case. Request granted by Dr. ██████. SCP-493-02 and SCP-493-03 are denied access to all other SCP-493s. (██/██/1980)

&#34;And I am sick and tired of them heaping extra paperwork on me by quoting obscure regulations that I didn’t even know about.&#34;- Dr. ██████.

**Update 493-05:** SCP-493-04 dies after complications following a fall and a broken hip. (██/██/2005)

&#34;Well that was one of my more unpleasant deaths.&#34; –SCP-493-09, shortly after reconstitution.

**Memo 493-BA:** &#34;Request by Dr. ████████ to &#39;show him what an unpleasant death is&#39; denied. No, I don&#39;t care that he&#39;ll survive it; we don&#39;t need even more of these running around.&#34;
