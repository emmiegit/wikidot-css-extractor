Th&#39; sea be massive. Isn’t mighty uncommon fer inexperienced pirates t&#39; lose thar grip on direction. By direction, I’m nah natterin&#39; about findin&#39; yer way… that be th&#39; easy part. Every pirate knows t&#39; follow th&#39; stars. Wha&#39; I be natterin&#39; about be th&#39; direction o&#39; yer heart, direction o&#39; wha&#39; we find most important t&#39; us.

Let us get down t&#39; th&#39; subject at hand. I’m sure ye aren’t here t&#39; hear me babblin&#39; about destiny, determination, desire… &#39;n other crap like that. Y’ae here &#39;cause o&#39; th&#39; title o&#39; me tale, aren’t ye? Quite an enticin&#39; hook int’ it? Let’s jus&#39; say I was quite th&#39; fisherman back in me day. Enough jokin&#39; around. It’s time t&#39; get serious. An Ode to Babashe. Except it really isn’t much o&#39; an ode… but more o&#39; a bone-rattlin&#39; tale o&#39; a young lad grasped within th&#39; clutch o&#39; a wench’s love. Except we aren’t natterin&#39; about a wench, but a fiery lassie seductress from within th&#39; gates o&#39; **Davy Jones&#39; locker**… but aye, th’ love ‘twas real no doubt.

Our tale begins on a fateful night on th&#39; Arabian Sea. Back in those days I was but only a deckhand. Me work was simple. Scrubbin&#39; th&#39; canteen floors &#39;n loadin&#39; barrels; I reckon I was pretty good at it… but I digress. Well th&#39; cap&#39;n o&#39; th&#39; ship, I know&#39;t his name &#39;twas Rougefoot, was in search o&#39; a loot in these waters. See, Captain Rougefoot had heard tales as a lad bout’ a //fountain o&#39; gold//. In fact, everyone had heard tales about th&#39; fountain, but damn Rougefoot was th&#39; only one t&#39; believe it t&#39; be true. Me ole cap&#39;n was an **idiot**, but then again, so was I. I must &#39;ave been 14 or 15 when we first set off on th&#39; great Arabian Sea. I remember that day like &#39;twas yesterday. Th&#39; sky was green, as if ye were standin&#39; under a great banyan tree. However, we payed no mind &#39;n dropped th&#39; sails. Th&#39; other deckhands told me green clouds meant that a tornado was nigh, but they assured me &#39;twas fine—tornados don’t blow out in th&#39; sea they told me. Then it started t&#39; rain… &#39;n //fuckall// &#39;twas like standin&#39; under a waterfall.

It stormed fer wha&#39; seemed like days. What’s worse be that we hadn’t seen th&#39; sun in all that time; jus&#39; th&#39; //fuckin’// green clouds &#39;n rain so thick ye could’nat see 5 feet in front o&#39; ye. In th&#39; midst o&#39; all th&#39; action, aft mast snapped in two. Then in wha&#39; seemed like a miracle at first, th&#39; storm nigh-on immediately cleared up. But this weren’t no miracle but a curse. Nah only had th&#39; rain stopped, but th&#39; wind too. Th&#39; sea was as calm as a midsummers day &#39;n we weren’t movin&#39; a //fuckin&#39;// inch. We were stuck. I helped lift th&#39; fallen mast wit&#39; a few o&#39; th&#39; deckhands. I remember cryin&#39;. I hadn’t known these two lads, but that dammed mast knocked th&#39; //fuckin&#39;// guts out o&#39; them. At least they went out smartly… nobody could &#39;ave survived that. Captain Rougefoot said a few words &#39;n then ordered that we throw th&#39; two lads o&#39;erboard. I wanted t&#39; refuse, they deserved better, but I understood. Sickness be a fate worse than death out on th&#39; sea. 

That night I had a dream. I was standin&#39; up t&#39; me knees in a body o&#39; seemingly endless water. It felt like I was walkin&#39; fer miles &#39;til I saw a figure in th&#39; distance. &#39;twas a lassie wit&#39; beautiful red hair. As I approached her, I noticed that she had nah hair, but hairs o&#39; fire &#39;n ember. She called out t&#39; me. “Do nah be afeared, I be Babashe, Queen o&#39; Flame.” Her voice was as beautiful as sprin&#39; &#39;n her eyes demandin&#39; &#39;n seductive. As she embraced me, th&#39; water turned t&#39; blood &#39;n I could hear th&#39; screams o&#39; me crewmates. &#39;twas **horrible**. I screamed fer it t&#39; stopped as she squeezed me tighter &#39;n tighter &#39;n—I arose.

Three days. Three //fuckin&#39;// days. We had seen no change in wind nor a single wave in th&#39; sea. We hadn’t been prepared fer a long trip &#39;n th&#39; supplies were dwindlin&#39;. Even worse, th&#39; crew was beginnin&#39; t&#39; grow restless. I heard natter o&#39; scuttlin&#39; th&#39; cap&#39;n. Been up in his shillin&#39;s doin&#39; jack-all one said. Another saw th&#39; cap&#39;n sneak a crate o&#39; grub in thar. I hadn’t known wha&#39; t&#39; believe. At grub we were served half o&#39; wha&#39; we normally got. This further angered th&#39; crew. One o&#39; th&#39; deckhands jumped up &#39;n knocked th&#39; lights out o&#39; one o&#39; th&#39; cooks &#39;n began grabbin&#39; wha&#39; grub he could. Chaos ensued. Thar was naught th&#39; higherups could do t&#39; stop th&#39; angry hoard o&#39; starvin&#39; crewmates. I didn’t know wha&#39; t&#39; do… I jus&#39; sat thar &#39;n ate me stew… shiverin&#39;. I didn’t wants t&#39; die. Another couple days o&#39; this &#39;n we would &#39;ave all be dead. At that point I nigh-on envied those two dead lads. They wouldn’t &#39;ave t&#39; live wit&#39; wha&#39; was next t&#39; come.

In th&#39; midst o&#39; th&#39; fight fer grub, th&#39; door bust down. &#39;twas Captain Rougefoot. &#39;n by Christ we wouldn’t &#39;ave recognized &#39;im if he hadn’t had his hat on. He was horribly burned from head t&#39; toe... his face whas boil&#39;d t&#39; a prune. Suddenly th&#39; crew stopped in thar tracks. &#39;twas I alone who approached th&#39; cap&#39;n. He was still breathin&#39;. Afore I could ask who had done this t&#39; &#39;im, th&#39; fore o&#39; th&#39; ship had suddenly caught ablaze. Me &#39;n th&#39; other deckhands flooded through th&#39; doors &#39;n onto th&#39; deck, fillin&#39; buckets o&#39; water wit&#39; hopes o&#39; puttin&#39; out th&#39; fire. But wha’ever ‘twas we tried th’ fire stood ragin’. Then out th&#39; corner o&#39; me eye I saw… wha&#39; seemed t&#39; be a **flamin&#39; tornado off th&#39; starboard bow.** Th’ crew they ran to th’ edge o’ th’ ship ‘nd went out screamin’. Damned sky turn’t red ‘nd many a men jump’t o’erboard. Th&#39; tornado jus’ ripped right through th&#39; deck. Th&#39; crew laid horrified. Thar was naught they could do. Th&#39; tornado then appeared above th&#39; ship like a great flamin&#39; angel &#39;n begain t&#39; descend upon th&#39; deck. Countless deckhands were cast up into fiery deaths, screamin’ n’ holerin’ like. They were boilin&#39; like th&#39; stew fer grub, but fer some reason I was nah affected by th&#39; pull n’ heat o&#39; th&#39; tornado. I could ‘ear me mates say’n thar final pray’rs for they were ripp’d apart. Then afore me eyes th&#39; tornado manifested into some lassi… &#39;twas th&#39; Babashe. 

She was singin&#39;. By Christ &#39;twas beautiful. She looked exactly like she did in me dream, &#39;n I thought she was gorgeous. I knew somethin&#39; was terribly wrong… I mean me fello’ deckhands ‘ad been burn’t alive, but I ‘twas entranced noneth’less. Again, she told me: “Do nah be afeared, I be Babashe, Queen o&#39; Flame.” I stood up whence I had fallen. “O, Babashe. I be nah afeared,” I told her. She came fourth t&#39; embrace me. As she did, th&#39; rest o&#39; th&#39; crew melted away, screamin&#39; as they went. Thar blood filled th&#39; sea. Fer a moment I thou’t I was in //fuckin// hell. It troubled me somewhat, but this seductress had me in ‘er grasp. “I reckon I’m in love,” I said t’ her. She grinned a big grin &#39;n kissed me. Aye, ‘t hurt but felt most right. &#39;Twas at this moment I had found me true love. Like magic, th&#39; flames on th&#39; ship were put out. “Wot ‘twas all that mess for,” I ask’t her. “Killin thos scallywags like thar’?” Aft a few minutes o’ silence, Babashe replied, “Ye wer ‘th only one who could’av save me.” I wasna’t sure wha&#39; she meant at th&#39; time, but then like magic, th&#39; torn planks &#39;n bolts were floatin&#39; about. It wasna’t long &#39;til th&#39; ship was completely fixed &#39;n ready fer sailin&#39;.We had planned t&#39; sail away together, but all good thin&#39;s must end. Nearin&#39; th&#39; edge o&#39; th&#39; calm spot&#39;, Babashe had grown worried. “Goodbye me love,” she told me. ‘Twas confused, but this had been th&#39; last words I heard out o&#39; her. Jus&#39; as we sailed up o&#39;er th&#39; waves, Babashe melted into th&#39; sea. 

Lookin&#39; back, I understand now why Babashe ‘ad chosen me. I was th&#39; youngest on th&#39; ship. I was th&#39; easiest one t&#39; fool. If Babashe was th&#39; Queen o&#39; Flame, then she would &#39;ave wanted me t&#39; be th&#39; King. But she ‘ad been trapp’t. Trapp’t in th&#39; that lit’l calm spot in th&#39; sea. On those fateful days oh so many years ago, a Queen ‘ad been separated from ‘er King. 

Me name be Captain Rougeheart &#39;n today I shall sail again. I’ve gathered meself a crew &#39;n today I be settin&#39; out t&#39; find me long-lost love, me precious Babashe. A wench I be strung t&#39; by faith. T’ anyone who reads this… wish me luck.

Th&#39; sky be green today.</textarea></pre>
