[[/=]]

Due to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/broken-masquerade-hub post-Veil circumstances] and the relative harmlessness of SCP-6963, no protocols have been enacted to confine those affected by the anomaly. Subjects of SCP-6963 treat their targeted individual as fictional, and as such, should be publicly considered so in order to bring little suspicion to the person in question.

Research into the cause behind SCP-6963’s creation to possibly methodize a way to reverse its effects is currently ongoing.[[footnote]]Dr. Bright’s request to be reassigned to a separate anomaly has been denied for the time being.[[/footnote]]

+++ **__Description__**
[[/=]]

SCP-6963 denotes an abnormal phenomenon surrounding [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-963 Dr. Jack Bright,] the criteria in which one is affected remains unclear. To date, an estimate of ~250,000 individuals worldwide have been subjected to the anomaly’s effects, and amnesticization has proven to be ineffective. However, those influenced by SCP-6963 are wholly convinced that Dr. Bright is merely a fictional character, despite a lack of evidence regarding the &#34;persona’s creator.&#34;

Subjects affected by SCP-6963 display intense feelings of affection towards Dr. Bright, oftentimes showing their appreciation for him via methods most appropriate to them. Examples of SCP-6963 related activities include (but are not limited to):

* Drawing pieces of art depicting Dr. Bright in some fashion.
* Producing music pertaining to Dr. Bright in some way.
* Writing fiction featuring Dr. Bright as the main protagonist.
* Creating merchandise of Dr. Bright.

The perpetrator responsible for SCP-6963‘s existence, if applicable, is unknown.

**MOOSE:** It&#39;s practically harmless, Bright. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve been through worse.

**BRIGHT:** Moose, when I first worked for the Foundation, I did not expect I&#39;d develop a fanbase overnight. I did not ask for this, I did not sign up for this, and I surely didn&#39;t spend over a century to suddenly have people craving my very presence.

You&#39;d still be exposed to all of the fictions revolving around you and their indiscernible imagination. It&#39;s basically fruitless.

Good day/afternoon/evening to everyone in the Bright community! We hope that every single one of you are doing your best. As you can tell by the post&#39;s title, this is an announcement from the mod team, and oh boy, this is a big one, indeed.

Of course, this is about our beloved character, Dr. Bright. To put it simply, we&#39;ll be opening up a new section, open to anybody to contribute. Obviously, we&#39;ll be looking over any additions made to this little experiment for any hate directed towards our precious child (damn haters &gt;:/). And you may be asking: &#34;What is this? What are you doing?&#34; Well...

We all know that our researcher here is professional, like your typical, top-notch scientist. People like him tend to be confused as a robot, forgetting that they are people too, and people like Bright make mistakes. This new page will be dedicated to all the mishaps he&#39;s made throughout his mischievous life working at the Foundation. This is to show that Bright isn&#39;t just some cold, soulless monster, but an actual person, with actual feelings.

And to make it even more intriguing, it&#39;ll be in a form of a list, a list of rules telling him what not to do... Feel free to add onto the record of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-things-dr-bright-is-not-allowed-to-do-at-the-foundation things Bright is not allowed to do at the Foundation.]
