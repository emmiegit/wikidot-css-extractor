+++ Fandom Stuff

What&#39;s been going on in the community aside from our site? Well...

* [[*user GemoDawn]], who operates the channel [https://www.youtube.com/user/SCPReadings SCPReadings], did two particularly impressive videos in December. The first is actually a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAyZiYhUMYc reading] of [[[scp-2521|●●|●●●●●|●●|●]]] - well, less of a reading and more of a discussion and interpretation of an SCP with no words, which really highlights what makes it such a special skip. If you&#39;re looking for a more conventional reading, there&#39;s a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPWRXb1d9eY good, icky one] of [[[SCP-1104]]]! She also did a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzj6ITbws2M lullaby] of sorts about the Foundation; a particularly haunting one, at that. A great channel all-around.
* Though this is in Russian, it is suitably creepy nonetheless. Влад Семецкий, or [https://www.youtube.com/user/nakomis132 nakomis132] has done [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtXAljPA0vM two] videos [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIl7hHmFUTU reading] [http://scpfoundation.ru/scp-1220-ru SCP-1220-RU], a creepy and disturbing skip. Perfect way to close off 2015, don&#39;t you think :3

++++ Fanart

Lots of cool fanart this month! In the holiday spirit, here is a truckload for you all, in a wide variety of styles!! If you haven&#39;t seen what artists on the site have produced, go [http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:page-tags/tag/artwork#pages here] and [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/c-662937/fan-work here] to see what we make!

* [http://daily-scp.tumblr.com/ Daily SCP] is a blog that does daily drawings of SCPs, going both in chronological order and taking requests. This month, one of their works that I particularly enjoyed was art of [[[SCP-445]]]. [http://daily-scp.tumblr.com/post/135042609146/121215-scp445-dr-wondertainments-super Incredibly silly and cute!]
* [http://overlordcrown.tumblr.com OverlordCrown] is our next feature for making a simple yet visually-unique drawing of one of my favorite SCPs, [[[SCP-1936]]], and reminded me of visually of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vib-Ribbon Vib-Ribbon] straightaway. **[Epilepsy Warning]** [http://overlordcrown.tumblr.com/post/136327475552/he-who-walks-beneath-dreams-an-elderly-human-in Go look here].
* [http://stairwayblues.tumblr.com/ Stairwayblues] is an artist with a colorful style and, well, since we have a tale about [[[scp-2030|2030]]] this month, why not link you a wonderful picture of it? Here&#39;s [http://stairwayblues.tumblr.com/post/135918581236/happy-holidays-folks-d SCP-2030] in all of its suave, charming glory. Laugh is indeed fun, and also colorful to boot!
* [http://perelka-l.tumblr.com/ Perelka-l] has her own fanart thread [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-1167751/yet-another-fanart-thread on the forums], but this isn&#39;t on the site, and I figure it&#39;d be worth it to bring more attention to her art! [[*user Perelka_L]] did a really neat one of [http://perelka-l.tumblr.com/post/136181233753/palette-36-pose-10b-with-agent-troy-lament Agent Troy Lament], because the agents working tirelessly and risking their lives each day need as much love as the SCPs too.
* Wondered how [[[SCP-1471]]] appears on all those pics? [http://the-shy-guy-art.tumblr.com/ Shiala] has thought so too, and decided to treat us to her interpretation of it. The result is a [http://the-shy-guy-art.tumblr.com/post/135559951708/selfie-shirt-design-based-off-scp-1471-i-always really cute pic]. Selfies!
* There&#39;s been a few Undertale/SCP crossover pics of recent, and my favorite from this month is [http://saintnevermore.deviantart.com/ SaintNevermore&#39;s] depiction of [[[SCP-682]]] as a boss. Can you even imagine?  Imagine no more! Check out the monstrosity that is 682 in Undertale-style [http://saintnevermore.deviantart.com/art/A-Reptillian-monster-bares-it-s-teeth-577567049 here].
* [http://eyesakiteiko.tumblr.com/ SorateikO716] has a style I particularly enjoy, with cute-looking humanoids and attention-drawing eyes. This artist did a whole photoset of SCPs, such as [[[SCP-1372]]], [[[SCP-2049]]], [[[SCP-1591]]], [[[SCP-1760]]], [[[SCP-2833]]], &amp; [[[SCP-1739]]]! It&#39;s always cool to see how some SCPs can be interpreted into humanoid figures! The photoset is [http://eyesakiteiko.tumblr.com/post/135696280032/scp-1372%E8%A5%BF%E7%AB%AF-scp-2049%E6%AC%A1%E5%85%83%E9%96%93%E6%B0%97%E8%B1%A1%E5%8F%B0-scp-1591%E5%A0%95%E3%81%A1%E3%81%9F%E6%98%9F here], and the artist has a personal website [http://scp-ch3oh.jimdo.com/ here]!
* [http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=14330397 寧子] has one image thus far, but it&#39;s a simple and pretty portrait of the ever-so-cute [[[SCP-131]]]. Not too much to say about it, other than I liked it a lot, enough to feature it here. Go see it [http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=54127257 here].
