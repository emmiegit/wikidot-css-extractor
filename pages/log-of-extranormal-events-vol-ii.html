&gt; **Foreword:** This page is to document anomalous events that have attracted the Foundation&#39;s interests, but occurred too briefly for the Foundation to secure or contain them. Instead, the Foundation deploys a cover-up team to conceal the evidence from the public. This is merely a reminder to agents and researchers that not all of them can be contained.
&gt; -Agent Carriontrooper

This is the second volume of the log, and remains open to new entries. The [[[log-of-extranormal-events| first volume ]]] has been archived.

Lists of [[[log-of-anomalous-items| Anomalous Items]]] and [[[log-of-unexplained-locations| Unexplained Locations]]] have also been compiled.

//**Note:** Please add new entries to the bottom of the list, not the middle or the top.//

**Event Description:** Several students abruptly stopped talking and began chanting in an unknown language.  After 37 seconds of this, they resumed their conversation as though nothing out of the ordinary had happened.  When the chanting was brought up by those unaffected, the students seemed confused and unaware of the event.
**Date of Occurrence:** 2023-05-31
**Location of Occurrence:** Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Security footage siezed and replaced.  Witnesses interviewed.  Cover story of a publicity stunt for an upcoming horror movie disseminated.  Location placed under Foundation surveillance.

**Event Description:** All golden retrievers within a ~35 kilometer radius turned to face downwards and to the right and said in the same female voice &#34;No one will ever believe you&#34; before resuming normal activity.
**Date of Occurrence:** 2023-06-01
**Location of Occurrence:** Regions of Montana, USA and Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada

**Event Description:** Upon reaching reception of ████ ██████ ████████ Hospital, an unidentified woman who gave her name as &#34;Ah&#34; dislocated her jaw and enlarged her mouth and throat before vomiting a child of indeterminate age and gender and stating &#34;Can you help this thing? Come down with a real bad case of humanity.&#34; When questioned by confused staff, the woman and child revealed their tongues, which were forked and normal, respectively. After silently viewing the distress among staff and other visitors for several seconds, the woman swallowed her child and then herself in a manner reported to resemble &#34;a tape measure shooting back into itself&#34;.

**Event Description:** All Foundation personnel became unable to add any new information to the Foundation&#39;s [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/log-of-extranormal-events Database of Extranormal Events]. Upon attempting to do so, personnel would experience retrocausal elimination wholly and solely affecting their addition of information. After Level 2 Researcher Stewart Clemens attempted this 66 times as personal experimentation, the word &#34;Wikidot&#34; was retrocausally burnt into his computer screen at some point during its creation. Despite this, no paradoxes have resulted from the inability to see crucial information in the local-past after this event occurred.
**Date of Occurrence:** 2023-06-06
**Location of Occurrence:** Worldwide
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/log-of-extranormal-events-vol-ii New database created], and original database locked. Clemens has been issued a new computer, which has maintained a normal causal chain and relatively undamaged screen.

**Event Description:** Approximately thirty-four (34) ectomorphic entities (colloq. &#34;spirits&#34;) spontaneously manifested within the main library of a university, and immediately began wrestling with one another. The entities vaguely resembled humans wearing Judogi attire, and were recorded performing various Judo techniques, occasionally using violent striking moves (//Atemi-waza//). The battle continued for four (4) hours and caused extreme destruction to surrounding furniture, including the deterioration of 273 books by ectoplasm. The entities dematerialized after a civilian janitor witnessed the event.

**Location of Occurence:** Meeting room C-2, Site-██
**Follow Up Actions Taken:** Meeting room unavailable for 2 days. Staff present given 25% discount for on-site laundry service. Remains of Dr. Koenig returned to relatives under cover story &#34;Sinclair&#34;[[footnote]]Industrial meat processing accident.[[/footnote]].

**Event Description**: For two hours, at the location of a bottling plant belonging to GoI-████ &#34;The ████-Cola Company&#34;, the color red ceased to exist inside the plant. Employees present at the facility report that they felt calm and relaxed for the duration of the event. After two hours had passed, employees report that the color red returned but that it was somehow &#34;more red&#34; than before. When this occurred, employees report having become irritable, and several became violent as a result, with one going so far as to stab another with a concealed knife over a perceived slight. 5 people were injured as a result of this occurrence. One employee, a Mr. ███████ Smith, fled the scene, and claims to have seen &#34;men in beige trench-coats&#34; outside the bottling plant.
**Date of Occurrence:** 10-14-20██
**Location of Occurence:** ████-Cola Bottling Co., ███████, New Hampshire.
**Follow Up Actions Taken:** MTF-Xi-13 &#34;Sequere Nos&#34; arrived at the scene 1 hour after the red coloration returned, and after assessing the situation to be of low severity, used non-lethal riot control weapons to subdue the hostile employees. After all threats were neutralized, the facility was evacuated, and all employees were amnesticized.
MTF-Psi-7 &#34;Home Improvement&#34; would later demolish the building and contain any effected pieces. Rival GoI &#34;█████Co Inc. &#34; (GoI-████) claims no involvement in the event, instead suggesting that it was perpetrated by a group they referred to as &#34;█████&#34;, which is not present in Foundation files.
Further investigation ongoing.

**Event Description:** It was discovered that all 303 staff that had been initially assigned to the newly constructed Site-27 had the nickname &#34;Reggie&#34;[[footnote]]Often short for the names Reginald or Regina.[[/footnote]]. Through interrogation of the administrative staff members responsible for the assignment of personnel to facilities, it has been determined that this event was not intentional. Furthermore, it was discovered that several other facilities, including Area-092, Outpost-19-97, and Site-454 also had abnormally large numbers of staff with similar names. The current hypothesis is that an extranormal memetic pattern had affected the staff in question. As of 6/25/23, it has been confirmed that no administrative staff are currently sufferring from any memetic effect at the present moment, meaning that such an effect was temporary.
**Date of Occurrence:** Initial Date Unknown, Event Discovered 6/23/23
**Location of Occurrence:** Containment Site-27.
**Follow Up Actions Taken:** None required.

**Event Description:** One //Python bivittatus//[[footnote]] Burmese python [[/footnote]] turned a bright red coloration and ceased all movement before --disappearing from view-- becoming intangible and traveling upwards at &gt;0.99c, as verified by Foundation probes in the Oort cloud. The python&#39;s location is unknown at this time, and likely unknowable.
**Date of Occurrence:** 2023-07-10
**Location of Occurrence:** San Diego City Zoo, San Diego, California, USA
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Witnesses amnesticized and relevant footage seized. Replacement python given, substitution yet unnoticed.

**Event Description:** All individuals within Manhattan possessing a fursona spontaneously vocalized their fursona&#39;s name. During the subsequent investigation and clean-up of this event, all assigned personnel not currently audible to civilians yelled &#34;Oh my god I am so sorry for this and I swear this was only meant to be a small thing! I am so, so sorry, please don&#39;t come after me, please! This should help you deal with my mess, I hope. I&#39;m shutting up now, bye.&#34; Approximately six minutes later, all witnesses to this event, including Foundation personnel, vocalized an amnesticizing memetic phrase and resumed normal activities.
**Date of Occurrence:** 2023-07-10
**Location of Occurrence:** Manhattan, New York, USA
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Relevant footage seized, final amnesticizations conducted. Location of the responsible entity, designated PoI-38779, has been deemed a High priority.

**Event Description:** Statue of General █████████ █████, a controversial general of the Confederate Army in the American Civil War, spontaneously animated. A transcript of the event has been left below:
&gt; **[1924 hours, ████████ City Park]**
&gt; 
&gt; █████, in a teenage male voice: &#34;After ten thousand years, I&#39;m free! Free at last!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; //█████ leaves its pedestal and begins a dance called &#34;The Griddy&#34;//
&gt; 
&gt; █████: &#34;Hey, ya&#39; lily-livered poopheads. I am █████████ █████ and I am stupid and a horrible person who owned slaves. You all are even stupider than me though for actually worshipping me. Like what did I-&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; //█████ straightens its body and begins speaking in an adult male voice//
&gt; 
&gt; █████: &#34;Actually, I was a fine role model for both then and now. I was both able to command a strong army on the battlefield, and a loving family at home. I merely fought off northern oppression to protect our glorious heritage and life-&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; █████, voice #1: &#34;Bullshit. Bullshitty shitty shit. Go tell them about state&#39;s rights or some more bullshit like that. Or how about your hero&#39;s family&#39;s servant, why don&#39;t you. Bet she was totally-&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; █████ #2: &#34;Oh fuck off you ignorant goody two shoes Tiktok b-&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; █████ then punches itself in the jaw and destroys the statue&#39;s lower face, before further awkwardly fighting itself. After approximately thirty seconds of this, the statue crumbles into its component parts and deanimates.
**Date of Occurrence:** 2023-07-10
**Location of Occurrence:** ████████ City Park, ████████, South Carolina
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Witnesses amnesticized, relevant footage seized. Cover Story 124B &#34;Structural Degradation&#34; enforced.
