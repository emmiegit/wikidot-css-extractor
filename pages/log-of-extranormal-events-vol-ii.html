&gt; **Foreword:** This page is to document anomalous events that have attracted the Foundation&#39;s interests, but occurred too briefly for the Foundation to secure or contain them. Instead, the Foundation deploys a cover-up team to conceal the evidence from the public. This is merely a reminder to agents and researchers that not all of them can be contained.
&gt; -Agent Carriontrooper

This is the second volume of the log, and remains open to new entries. The [[[log-of-extranormal-events| first volume ]]] has been archived.

Lists of [[[log-of-anomalous-items| Anomalous Items]]] and [[[log-of-unexplained-locations| Unexplained Locations]]] have also been compiled.

**Location of Occurrence:** Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Security footage siezed and replaced.  Witnesses interviewed.  Cover story of a publicity stunt for an upcoming horror movie disseminated.  Location placed under Foundation surveillance.

Come down with a real bad case of humanity.&#34; When questioned by confused staff, the woman and child revealed their tongues, which were forked and normal, respectively.

Upon attempting to do so, personnel would experience retrocausal elimination wholly and solely affecting their addition of information. After Level 2 Researcher Stewart Clemens attempted this 66 times as personal experimentation, the word &#34;Wikidot&#34; was retrocausally burnt into his computer screen at some point during its creation. Despite this, no paradoxes have resulted from the inability to see crucial information in the local-past after this event occurred.
**Date of Occurrence:** 2023-06-06
**Location of Occurrence:** Worldwide

**Event Description**: For two hours, at the location of a bottling plant belonging to GoI-████ &#34;The ████-Cola Company&#34;, the color red ceased to exist inside the plant. Employees present at the facility report that they felt calm and relaxed for the duration of the event. After two hours had passed, employees report that the color red returned but that it was somehow &#34;more red&#34; than before. When this occurred, employees report having become irritable, and several became violent as a result, with one going so far as to stab another with a concealed knife over a perceived slight. 5 people were injured as a result of this occurrence. One employee, a Mr. ███████ Smith, fled the scene, and claims to have seen &#34;men in beige trench-coats&#34; outside the bottling plant.

**Event Description:** It was discovered that all 303 staff that had been initially assigned to the newly constructed Site-27 had the nickname &#34;Reggie&#34;[[footnote]]Often short for the names Reginald or Regina.[[/footnote]]. Through interrogation of the administrative staff members responsible for the assignment of personnel to facilities, it has been determined that this event was not intentional. Furthermore, it was discovered that several other facilities, including Area-092, Outpost-19-97, and Site-454 also had abnormally large numbers of staff with similar names. The current hypothesis is that an extranormal memetic pattern had affected the staff in question. As of 6/25/23, it has been confirmed that no administrative staff are currently sufferring from any memetic effect at the present moment, meaning that such an effect was temporary.

I am so, so sorry, please don&#39;t come after me, please! This should help you deal with my mess, I hope. I&#39;m shutting up now, bye.&#34; Approximately six minutes later, all witnesses to this event, including Foundation personnel, vocalized an amnesticizing memetic phrase and resumed normal activities.

&gt; 
&gt; //█████ straightens its body and begins speaking in an adult male voice//
&gt; 
&gt; █████: &#34;Actually, I was a fine role model for both then and now. I was both able to command a strong army on the battlefield, and a loving family at home. I merely fought off northern oppression to protect our glorious heritage and life-&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; █████, voice #1: &#34;Bullshit. Bullshitty shitty shit. Go tell them about state&#39;s rights or some more bullshit like that. Or how about your hero&#39;s family&#39;s servant, why don&#39;t you. Bet she was totally-&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; █████ #2: &#34;Oh fuck off you ignorant goody two shoes Tiktok b-&#34;
