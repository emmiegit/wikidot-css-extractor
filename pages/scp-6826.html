**Special Containment Procedures:** All living SCP-6826 units are to be contained in 3 interconnected standard human containment cells. SCP-6826-D is contained within the other SCP-6826 instances&#39; quarters. All SCP-6826 instances in containment are implanted with tracking devices, which can also be used to dispatch of the instances via non-lethal shocks to the nervous system, in case of an attempt at escape or violence. SCP-6826-A, SCP-6826-B and SCP-6826-C are permitted to interact with facility staff, however this is a privilege, and not a right, and should be revoked immediately if an instance begins to show hostility towards staff.

SCP-6826-D is to be provided a live house cat every 40 days, while SCP-6826-A, SCP-6826-B and SCP-6826-C are to be provided a live organism from the family //Hominidae//[[footnote]]the group known commonly as great apes[[/footnote]] every 40 days. Physiological services are available to staff working with SCP-6826 instances, as well as SCP-6826 instances themselves, in order to help them cope with the disturbing nature of SCP-6826&#39;s feeding routine.


**Description:** SCP-6826 refers to six entities, two of whom are deceased, who appear to be identical to the Hill Family[[footnote]]A family of five which operated a small dairy farm in Vermont[[/footnote]], and their pet house cat[[footnote]]For a comprehensive list of SCP-6826 instances, see document 6826-1[[/footnote]]. Despite this, all three living human instances claim not to be the same individual which they biologically match, maintaining that the Family all suffered a massive headache, causing them to black out for several minutes, leading to all SCP-6826 instances&#39; first conscious moments. SCP-6826-D does not appear to have the ability to confirm nor deny these allegations, although its existence suggests that the explanation given by the other SCP-6826 instances is accurate.

SCP-6826 entities all have the ability to afflict a state of paralysis within other living mammals, which will take 150-170 hours to dissipate. While the subject cannot sleep, eat, drink or breath during this period, they are kept not only alive but will appear to be well fed, well rested, and fully hydrated by all known measures, even if they sustained major damage to their body during this period. Effected subjects are fully capable of moving their eyes, and occasionally capable of making other small body movements, such as bending one of their digits. The chemical or biological cause of this effect has yet to be discovered.

SCP-6826 entities appear to have a drive to seek out and consume biological instances similar to themselves once every two months[[footnote]]Other Felines for SCP-6826-D, and other Great Apes for all other known instances of SCP-6826[[/footnote]], which they must eat alive under the influence of their primary anomalous effect in order to survive[[footnote]]Instances must do this in addition to consuming a typical amount of the food that their particular non-anomalous counterparts would consume[[/footnote]]. This has caused great psychological stress to the humanoid instances of SCP-6826.

**Addendum 6826.2:** Discovery
Authorities came to investigate the Hill residence after Margret Hill was reported missing by her parents, who had not heard from her or her family in over 48 hours. Authorities arrived at the Hill&#39;s residence, but failed to report back for more than one hour, prompting local authorities to send backup. Two FBI agents, who were in the area investigating the disappearance of Alex Flynn, were also alerted.

The two officers who were initially sent to the house were found within the Hill&#39;s dinning room, and were rushed to the hospital as they were apparently effected with the paralytic agent used by SCP-6826 instances. Agents also discovered the body of Alex Flynn in the basement. Ms Flynn was missing the lower half of her body, along with two of the fingers on her right hand, and most of her blood. She was also rushed to the hospital, but intercepted by Foundation agents, who became aware of the situation through the UIU. SCP-6826-F was later discovered dead in the Hill Bedroom. Cause of death was determined to be starvation.

The Foundation managed to locate the Hill Family 20 miles from their home, driving from the farm to an unknown destination[[footnote]]SCP-6826-D was present in the family&#39;s vehicle[[/footnote]]. SCP-6826-B, who was apparently driving, had veered off of the road to avoid an object in the road, causing the vehicle to flip and collide with a tree. All instances were unconscious, and the Foundation was able to give them proper medical care.

**Dr. Collins:** I&#39;m sorry?
**SCP-6826-B:** Johnathan Hill is gone. I am not Johnathan Hill.
**Dr. Collins:** I see. Who are you then?
//SCP-6826-B does not respond.//
**Dr. Collins:** Very well, we were wondering if you could tell us anything about the condition of Alex Flynn.
//SCP-6826-B does not respond.//
**Dr. Collins:**//(clearly frustrated)// Could you please explain to me how the body of Alex Flynn ended up in your basement?
**SCP-6826-B:** Yeah. It was the one in Don’s body. He did it.
**Dr. Collins:** So Donald Hill is responsible for the death of Alex Flynn?
**SCP-6826-B:** No. We all are.
**Dr. Collins:** Mr. Hill, are you confessing to the murder of-
**SCP-6826-B:** I AM NOT JOHNATHAN HILL!
//Dr. Collins backs up against the wall as SCP-6826-B moves out of its bed, shouting.//
**SCP-6826-B:** Johnathan Hill is fucking dead ok? He died along with the rest of his goddamned family and now I’m here.
**Dr. Collins:** Guards, please restrain him.
//Guards rush towards SCP-6826-B, and attempt to detain him, however one gets within arms reach of SCP-6826-B and it hits the guard, apparently paralyzing him.//
**SCP-6826-B:** Fuck! I’m sorry I’m sorry I-

**Interviewed:** SCP-6826-B
**Interviewer:** Dr. Connors
**Forward:** //Interview took place shortly after initial containment. SCP-6826-B and Dr. Collins are separated by a wall of bulletproof glass, as the Foundation believed SCP-6826 hostile to human life at this point.//
----
= **&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;**
**Dr. Collins:** Good morning, SCP-6826-B. Are you ready to have a conversation today.
**SCP-6826-B:** Yeah. I&#39;m sorry about yesterday. Yeah.
**Dr. Collins:** No need to worry about it. We&#39;ll still help you to the best of our abilities, despite yesterday&#39;s incident. 
//Dr. Collins glances down at his clipboard.//
**Dr. Collins:** So, you claimed that... Johnathan Hill and his family are dead, despite the fact that by all accounts, you, SCP-6826-A and SCP-6826-C fit the description of Johnathan Hill, Donald Hill and Lauren Hill perfectly. Could you explain what you meant by that?
**SCP-6826-B:** Yeah. Yeah, of course. 
//SCP-6826-B pauses for about two seconds.//
**SCP-6826-B:** God, this is going to be really hard to explain. Let me think. Do you remember your first conscious moment?
//Dr. Collins shakes their head.//
**SCP-6826-B:** Well I do. My first moment was me picking myself up off the floor of the Hill&#39;s living room, two months ago. My first ever waking moment. I had all of John&#39;s memories leading up to that moments but, well, I had taken John&#39;s place. I could just tell. I first thought I must be having some sort of existential crisis, but looking into their eyes, the eyes of the others, I could see they had felt it too.
**Dr. Connors:** They meaning?
**SCP-6826-B:** The others. The other ones, the ones you&#39;d call the Hill family. Those who are like me.
**Dr. Collins:** I see. Please continue.
**SCP-6826-B:** For awhile we all tried to pretend like nothing had happened. We played the role of each Hill we&#39;d been assigned by who knows what in order to keep up appearances. But we all knew. It was unspoken but whenever we were together, it was tense. we knew it had happened, and we had no idea what it was, and so we didn&#39;t want to address it, and our faces mirrored that reality.
**Dr. Collins:** So, you believe that you are some kind of entity which possessed Mr. Hill?
**SCP-6826-B:** Sort of. Whatever I was before I wasn&#39;t conscious. I just was. And now I&#39;m this. Something new.
**Dr. Collins:** And all the others in the Hill family met the same fate?
**SCP-6826-B:** Yes.
**Dr. Collins:** Understood. Please continue.
**SCP-6826-B:** We were able to ignore it but eventually I started to have... dreams. I started to.. to dream about cannibalism. I&#39;d rather not go into any further detail than that.
**Dr. Collins:** Completely understandable. I take it you found these dreams disturbing?
**SCP-6826-B:** Yes. Absolutely, I fucking did. I didn&#39;t tell the rest of them I was having these dreams. I didn&#39;t want to scare the shit out of them. But its clear they were also having the same intrusive thoughts. Everything came to a head one day in the basement. The cat must have been one of us, too. Before we killed the Hills. One day, the one in Cheryl&#39;s body went into the basement and found a cat. It was half eaten alive. All its blood was gone from its body. Ants were picking at its remains but... But its eyes still moved. It was still alive. The one in Cheryl&#39;s body [[span class=&#34;bblock&#34;]]decided to end it[[/span]] after that. We reported the death to the police and planned a funeral...
//SCP-6826-B trails off and looks away.//
**Dr. Collins:** I&#39;m very sorry about that.
//SCP-6826-B does not respond.//
**Dr. Collins:** I don&#39;t want to rush you, but if you could, could you explain what Mr. Flynn has to do with any of this?
**SCP-6826-B:** Yes.
//SCP-6826-B takes a moment to gather its thoughts.//
**SCP-6826-B:** After that point I began to feel a feeling of, well, something between hunger and fear. I knew if I didn&#39;t... you know, feed, I would die soon. I believe the others felt the same way as well. One day, Don came home and he had a body. I don&#39;t understand what happened exactly, but he said he touched him and he just... stopped moving. He was still alive. His eyes were still moving. We... No, I, I should have called the goddamn police. Or an ambulance. Or something.
**Dr. Collins:** And why didn&#39;t you?
**SCP-6826-B:** If we got the authorities involved, we knew that we would likely either end up in a mental institution, not something we could afford to pay for, or a government lab. Seems like that happened despite my efforts.
**Dr. Collins:** I can assure you, no harm will come to you here.
//SCP-6826-B is silent for around seven seconds.//
**SCP-6826-B:** I&#39;d rather stop talking about this now.
**Dr. Collins:** That&#39;s perfectly fine. Thank you for being so cooperative.
