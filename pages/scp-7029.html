SCP-7029 is to remain in Site-71’s Experimental-Exclusion Zone. Thusly, SCP-7029 is not to be experimented on without express permission from the O5 Council, coinciding with Administrative endorsement. Non-adherence to these protocols and subsequent testing is punishable by immediate termination, as SCP-7029’s properties could lead to a GSK-Event[[footnote]]Gravitational Singularity - End of World Scenario[[/footnote]]. Thusly, SCP-7029, shall never be opened more than 0.2mm PT[[footnote]]Past-Threshold[[/footnote]].

=  [[size 120%]]**__DESCRIPTION__**[[/size]]
SCP-7029 is a 180cm x 80cm x [REDACTED]cm metallic door, situated within a 181cm x 81cm x [REDACTED]cm metallic frame. SCP-7029 is composed of an as-yet-to-be-identified anomalous metallic alloy. This alloy is entropically pressure, temperature, and damage resistant. As SCP-7029 opens and is separated from its baseline closure, the mass of the entire structure increases exponentially related to the distance from its frame. It is theorized that should SCP-7029 open completely, it would constitute a mass-gravitational singularity corresponding with a zero-point vacuum density that would facilitate a universal vacuum collapse response.

= [[size 120%]]**__DISCOVERY__**[[/size]]
SCP-7029 was originally found within a basement of a 19th century home within Haverhill, Massachusetts. The Foundation was made aware of the structure after the summer of 1953, when locals in the area began holding strength competitions to determine whom among the populous could open the door furthest, suffering numerous injuries. Upon further testing in the decades thereafter, it was found that the further the door was open, the higher the mass of the entire structure became. The highest recorded mark being that of May, 2018, at 02.5cm-PT with 7,520 metric kt[[footnote]]Kilotonnes[[/footnote]] structure buckling Site-71, resulting in the collapse of the testing area.

To be noted, in the years proceeding, SCP-7029 has yet to open enough to let any personnel or recording devices inside the PT zone.

Hey Bill,

Its me, Steve, Im just checking up on you to make sure you’re okay. I heard you just took on another project, and with everything that you’ve been going through, I just want to make sure you’re okay. As a friend, let me know how your are doing. 

It’s been a minute and I know the “Marina” thing really got to you.

Your Friend,
Bill.

Hey Steve,

Thank for reaching out. I can’t tell you how much that means to me. Just having someone who truly cares about me, in light of everything that has happened. I know I’ve been distant, and that wasn’t entirely my fault. 

I thought Marina was THE ONE, and I sunk everything I could into her. And ultimately, she bled me dry, dry of emotions and dry of humanity. 

What do you do, when you no longer have the person you thought you’d spend the rest of your life with?

For me it has just been settling into work. Work is all I  have now.

Bill,

While I desire, nay, envy your commitment &amp; devotion to the Foundation, lately you have been so distant and unreachable. I know this Marina situation must be hard on you.

 But, she is just a passing phase in your life! You must remember life will go on, life will continue.

Your Friend,
Bill.

I’m not so sure about that anymore, so much of my life has been centered around Marina, so much of my life devoted to her. That carries so much weight, so much that I am trying to lift, so much mass I’m trying to displace.

Steve, I know this must be hard, but you have such a wonderful career and life ahead of you. Forget Marina! You have to know that life has its issues, but where one door opens, another //always// opens! You have so many open doorways in front of you!

Maybe, but I’ll have you know, I may have so many doors open in front of me, so many ways for my life to go… 

However, the one door, the one place I want to go…

I know is forever not made for me. 

I can never reach there, never know the joy of the other side. Never know what a world where Marina and I live happily is like. 

Its exists beyond that known-less boundary… one where I can not tread.

That one door… will take a weight… a weight enough to destroy the universe to open.

I will never see what future lay beyond that threshold. Marina will forever remain outside of everything I’ve ever wanted. 

Everything I’ll ever be.

Thank you for your kind words.


Will see you around site.
