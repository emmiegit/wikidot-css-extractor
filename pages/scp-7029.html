**Item #:** SCP-7029

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Scp-7029 is to be contained in a modern style room furnished with 1 bed and 1 recliner, as well as a television with restrictions.. Personnel are to enter only when Scp-7029&#39;s eyes are brown or a dark purple. If Scp-7029&#39;s eyes are crimson, personnel and D-Class are to evacuate the containment chamber immediately. If Scp-7000&#39;s eyes are glowing white, all personnel are to evacuate and leave all d-class inside the containment chamber. If Scp-7029&#39;s eyes are purple with a black shattered pattern all personnel are to evacuate the site and terminate all d-class.


**Description:** Scp-7029 is a humanoid entity that has wolf-like ears and tail. The fur covering these are a dark purple color with hints of blue, crimson, and black at the tip of the tail. Scp-7029 was discovered when an unknown person hacked into the Foundation&#39;s database and marked location the location of an unknown anomaly. When a retrieval was sent to investigate the location they saw a 12 year old teenager standing in front of the opening of a cave. Before he could be questioned, he admitted that he was technically the one who had hacked into the database.

   When asked what he meant by technically, he simply stated that he would not answer that question, as he had no intention of revealing too much about him yet. When brought back to site-██ and asked why he marked his location, he said that he knew it wouldn&#39;t be long until he was discovered by the foundation. When asked what he meant, he closed his eyes, his ears and tail appearing as if they were always there. He was immediately brought into containment afterwards. More interviews were conducted, revealing more information. He had made requests for objects to be brought into his chamber, some of which are still pending at this time.

   Scp-7029 has revealed knowledge of several anomalous entities, including Scp-096, Scp-682, and Scp-002. When he was asked how he knew of the Foundation, he refused to answer. Scp-7029 appears to have high authority over other wolves, and during cross-tests performed with the same wolves in the room, the wolves appeared to protect him when given the order. He does not seem to have any healing anomalies. During an interview, he told Dr.Sanders that 3 colors of his eyes mean danger to those around.

   When asked what colors those were, he said that glowing white meant he was insane, crimson meant his bloodlust was getting to a danger point, and purple with a black shattered pattern meant that the corruption was taking over his mind. When questioned about the corruption, he stopped talking and asked to be brought back to his containment chamber.

   Scp-7029 enjoys watching videos of memes and gaming videos. He has also revealed that he was diagnosed with ADHD, which explained the hyper-activity. He has shown interests in pranking foundation personnel, and tends to cause a loop in the security cameras while he sets up his pranks. He claims that he pranks personnel because &#34;everyone is constantly in a negative mood&#34; and wants to try and brighten up the mood, sometimes literally.

   Scp-7029 had requested to be referred to by his normal name during an interview with Dr.Sanders. After a cross-test with Scp-███, Scp-7029 asked if the foundation still wanted to know how he had hacked into the database. When he was brought back to his containment chamber, he told the personnel that he hadn&#39;t hacked into  the database himself, but a mental parasite did. Further questioning revealed that the parasite was a sentient computer virus that had mutated into a living glitch. Scp-7029 said that he referred to the glitch as Error, due to the color pattern resembling that usually associated with an error.


**Addendum: 7029.1 Associated Phenomena:** 
&gt; **Date:** 01/30/2019
&gt; **Location:** Site██
&gt; Dr.██████: Someone&#39;s accessing the database! I want someone to get the location now!
&gt; Tech Security #1: Dr.██████, a location was marked by the hacker, do you want us to send in a team to track down this person?
&gt; Dr.██████: Yes, I&#39;m authorizing the retrieval team now. Make sure they know where to go.

&gt; **Date:** 01/30/2019
&gt; **Location:** ██████ Forest, ████
&gt; Retrieval 1: Are you certain this is the location?
&gt; Retrieval 2: Yes, the mark was set at the mouth of this cave.
&gt; //Scp-7029 walks out of the cave and leans against the cave wall//
&gt; Scp-7029: You know, I thought you all would have been here quite a while ago after I marked this location, but the Foundation didn&#39;t send you out as fast as they have in past situations.
&gt; Retrieval 1: Are you the one who had hacked into the database?
&gt; Scp-7029: Technically, yes.
&gt; Retrieval 1: What do you mean technically?
&gt; Scp-7029: I&#39;d rather not disclose too much information yet. I suspect your taking me to the nearest facility for questioning?
&gt; Retrieval 2: How the hell do you know the procedures?
&gt; Scp-7029 I hacked into the database, dumbass. I think it should be obvious. And just to let you know, there&#39;s no need for the m-14&#39;s. I&#39;m not going to put up a fight.
&gt; Retrieval 1: Then follow us, and you better not be lying about not fighting us.
&gt; Scp-7029: God, it&#39;s like you don&#39;t even have a brain. I just said I wasn&#39;t going to fight.
**Addendum: 7029.2 Interview Logs**
&gt; **Date:**02/02/2019
&gt; **Location**Site-██
&gt; Dr.Sanders: So, your the one who hacked into the database, correct?
&gt; Scp-7029: Yes, I am.
&gt; Dr.Sanders: Ok, mind telling me why you had hacked into the database?
&gt; Scp-7029: Because I know that it wouldn&#39;t be long until the foundation discovered me.
&gt; Dr.Sanders:What do you mean by that?
&gt; //Scp-7029 closed his eyes, forcing his ears and tail to appear.//
&gt; Scp-7029: This is what I mean.
&gt; Dr.Sanders: I need a containment tem in here, now!
&gt; //A containment team rushes into the room and drags Scp-7000 into a containment chamber.//
&gt; **Date:**28/2/2019
&gt; //Scp-7029 is waiting for Dr.Sanders to come into the interview room for the 10 interview this month.//
&gt; //Dr.Sanders comes in half an hour later and starts to ask Scp-7000 questions.//
&gt; Dr.Sanders: So, Scp-7029, were you born with you anomalous abilities?
&gt; Scp-7029: 2 things, 1, please refer to me by name so that I don&#39;t go insane, including in the Addendums in the interview logs, and 2, I&#39;m not sure if I was born with these abilities or not. as I had only discovered them a few years after discovering the Foundation.
&gt; Dr.Sanders: I can see what I can do about the logs, what is your name anyways?
&gt; Scp-7029: My name is Daniel ████████.
&gt; Dr.Sanders: Ok, Daniel, next question. When you were found by the retrieval team, you said that you were technically the one who had hacked into the database. Could you tell us what you mean by technically?
&gt; Scp-7029: I won&#39;t be disclosing that information to the foundation, not unless he agrees.
&gt; Dr.Sanders: Who are you referring to?
&gt; Scp-7029: Someone that you do not need to worry about, and that is as much as I will disclose about it.
&gt; Dr.Sanders: Well then, that would conclude this interview.
&gt; Scp-7029: Very well then, hope you have a good day.
&gt; //as Dr.Sanders is walking away, an unknown interference occurred in front of Scp-7029//

&gt; **Addendum: 7029.3 Interview Logs**
&gt; **Date: 28/6/2019, Location: Site:██**
&gt; Scp-7029: Why do they do these cross-test? It&#39;s starting to get annoying.
&gt; //At this point the camera footage loses focus in one area in front of Scp-7029 and an unknown, broken voice filtered through.//
