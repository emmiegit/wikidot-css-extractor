+++ From the Journal of Aframos Longjourney, Pilgrim
+++ With notes by Avos Torr, Scholar of Rheve Library
+++ Erevday, Thirteenth Cycle, Seventh Year, 81st Turn

I met a goatherd today.  His name was Grotmor Horgon.  He was cautious, but friendly enough once he saw I was no threat.  His goats seemed more careful, and none would approach me closely.  I am usually good with animals, but his goats seemed less inclined to believe my good intentions.

Grotmor did not know of anything I might find to help my clan.  However, he told me that a hermit lives nearby.  The hermit is called Twisthorn, and Grotmor says that he was a traveller in his youth.  He might have encountered something my clan will need.

I haven&#39;t found the hill that Twisthorn calls home yet, but I did see something most interesting.  It was late in the afternoon, and the sky was a light gray blue.  I heard something in the air.  It sounded like a low buzzing, but a nest of bees.  I looked up, and there was a most peculiar thing.  It was flying, like a bat, or a harpy, but it appeared to be a made thing.  As near as I was able to tell, it was made of cloth, wood, and thin pieces of metal.    There was a central box-like structure, and I saw what looked like clockwork within.  I thought I saw crystals set on its surface, but I could not be certain, as it moved very quickly.  I watched it fly around me for several minutes, before leaving, heading to the west.  Was it indeed a device[[footnote]] This device bears a striking resemblance to similar clockwork engines found in parts of the Ravelwoods.  However, those tend to be more aggressive than the one Aframos encountered.  Icstrot Misplore theorizes that they&#39;re scouts for more powerful, intelligent machines part of a mechanical empire.  While it&#39;s tempting to dismiss this theory out of hand, one must remember the legend of the Gearnaut Civilization, told in many disparate parts of the Ravelwood and associated worlds. [[/footnote]] of some sort?  If so, who made it, and for what purpose?

Still, I was told there were strange things outside the Desert, and this did not seem dangerous.</textarea></pre>
