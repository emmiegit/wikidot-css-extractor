A shining cloud descended on the village
“**##grey|Hail##**” he said “**##grey|For I am Polarus, Winter’s son##**”
And from the village word was sent to the royal palace.
And from the palace an assassin was sent.

An [[[Polari|inky pillar]]] whirled into the village
“**##grey|Where?##**” it demanded “**##grey|Bring me to Winter’s son##**”
And from the village fled the shining cloud
And after him chased the inky pillar.

The shining cloud dove into a cave, speeding deep below the earth
“**##grey|Winter##**” he called out “**##grey|It has worked, I’ve lured it behind me##**”
And deeper still a great black being stirred
And after the cloud rushed down after the pillar.

Just as the inky pillar was about to capture the cloud, the two tumbled out into a cavernous opening
The black being roared “**Halt**” in a voice like shattering ice
And again it roared “**Traitor**”
And it spat unimaginable cold towards the pillar.

Though the pillar was itself a being of bitter frost, Winter was colder still
As the being’s blast tore through the pillar, it began to freeze in place
And as it solidified it let out a last anguished howl
And it toppled over, the crash of its impact echoing throughout the caverns

Winter called for its servants, and a bony man rushed into view
“**Bring this wretch to the deepest hole, and leave it there**” Winter commanded.
And for the first time in history, Winter left it’s cavern during summer
And it set off like a rabid hound towards the palace.
