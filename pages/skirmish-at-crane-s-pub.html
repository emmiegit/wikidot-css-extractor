&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. A█████ K██████ S██████:** Please state your name for the record.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Diana G█████████:** Huh? Oh, yeah, sure. Diana G█████████, MTF-█████-██.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. A█████ K██████ S██████:** And you were present during the events of ██/██/████ in Springfield, New Jersey? Is that correct?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Diana G█████████:** Yes, sir.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. A█████ K██████ S██████:** Right. Well, then, would you explain what happened there? Please be specific, this is going to be included in the final paperwork.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Diana G█████████:** //Leans forward in chair.// Okay, so I&#39;m eating lunch when I get the call. [Deeper voice, mocking tone] &#34;Get off your ass, Di! Some nutters are trying to take the place!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. A█████ K██████ S██████:** Mhmm.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Diana G█████████:** So then I say: &#34;Who would be stupid enough to assault here of all places?&#34; That place is paradise -- the best assignment I have ever had. Right next to this incredible deli that made my sandwich that day-
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. A█████ K██████ S██████:** [Interrupting] Who?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Diana G█████████:** The Parker Brothers Deli. Real nice guys, the folks that own it-
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. A█████ K██████ S██████:** [Interrupting] No, I mean who assaulted it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Diana G█████████:** Oh! Oh. Okay, so I get my gear on and hop over there, and I see three bastards from Micky Dee&#39;s arguing about something. There was a lot of p-

&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. A█████ K██████ S██████:** Oh, I see. Please continue.

&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. A█████ K██████ S██████:** What do you mean by that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sgt. Diana G█████████:** I&#39;m getting there -- so the first visual I get is these nutters taking cover behind a table that they knocked over or something. Glasses, beer, those little novelty hipster bottle openers -- all being flung at them. There were maybe three or four customers cowering behind anything they could find, too.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. A█████ K██████ S██████:** Is it true that the apparition in question was-

&gt; **Sgt. Diana G█████████:** [Interrupting] Who? Steve?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. A█████ K██████ S██████:** Yes.

René Dermott, Francis Connelly, and Gideon Branson had been monitoring the target for weeks, now. Their rival was good, no doubt about that. Outwardly, the place seemed like a normal business. Sales and tax records showed no suspicious activity, and the background checks on the owners came up clean. No one would suspect a thing if they didn&#39;t know how they operated. Arrogant, always arrogant. Too obvious with their cover, and, in the opinion of Mr. Connelly, terribly ordinary. This business required finesse -- the sort of skill unique to their organization. Evidently, Francis&#39; colleagues disagreed with him, because they were preparing to capture their target by force. Their usual methods had fell through, and his partners, being unaccustomed to field work, chose to risk it all and vanish rather than continue operating in the open.

&#34;You good, Fran?&#34; Gideon Branson said with genuine concern, a rarity in his line of work.

&#34;Terribly so, Mr. Branson, thank you,&#34; replied Francis.

&#34;You talk like you are from a movie, Connelly,&#34; René Dermott commented with unconcealed distaste.

&#34;Why, thank you, dear René,&#34; Francis chided with concealed distaste.

&#34;Ahh, that&#39;s just how Fran talks, Mrs. D. He don&#39;t mean nothing by it, I swears,&#34; said Mr. Branson.

They continued to prepare themselves in silence. Each had a small firearm in case things came to that, though only one of them knew how to use it. Gideon parked their stake-out car in an alley across the street, and all three met and casually walked into the brewery. It was empty, save for a young man behind the counter and a few customers sitting and enjoying their drinks. Almost immediately, the hanging lamps began to sway slowly. Then, the light bulbs exploded and the building was thrown into darkness. A few people screamed when the lights went out, but there was only a moment of blindness.

A soft green glow radiated from behind the counter. As it grew brighter, tables and chairs began to levitate. The faint outline of a man became distinguishable in the eerie light, and shot glasses hung in the air with the furniture. René Dermott, Francis Connelly, and Gideon Branson barely dodged a table when it sped toward them without warning. They sought cover behind it after it landed to protect themselves from an onslaught of cheap dining furniture.

&#34;Shoot it, for the love of God! Shoot it!&#34; Francis yelled.

Several shots were fired into blackness, until no bullets were left, but this only seemed to increase the speed of the projectiles.

The green glow crept closer to the three intruders. Just as Sgt. Diana apprehended them, a ghostly voice filled their ears...
