**Item #:** SCP-598

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-598 is contained in a three by three by three (3x3x3) meter room which has been painted solidly with Behr brand &#34;Pearly White&#34; paint. The floor is mirrored. Three (3) bright lights are positioned on the ceiling in such a way so that all the room is lit. These lights are to remain lit for 24 hours every day and are attached to a backup generator in case of power outage. The room will be examined for mold or stains daily, and these will be immediately removed if found.

 Two level-2 guards are to be stationed outside SCP-598’s room at all times. Supervised contact with SCP-598 is unrestricted to all personnel with Level-2 access. All are subject to searches before and after contact, and random psychoanalysis afterwards.

Unless permission is received from a overseer, tools such as knives, scalpels, mirrors, paint-peelers, or cameras are restricted.

**Description:** SCP-598 is an intelligent shade of yellow covering the whole of the inside of its cell. Attempts to reproduce SCP-598 with paints, crayons, etc., have failed. Through experimentation, SCP-598&#39;s properties have been discovered not to be tint or shade dependent (different shades of light, except for total darkness, will not affect the item&#39;s sentience) but are hue-dependent (a colored filter placed over the item&#39;s light source will cancel the effect). 

SCP-598 can process audiovisual stimuli in its nearby surroundings, but cannot speak nor move autonomously, nor communicate using normal senses. SCP-598 is, however, telepathic, and capable of holding extended mental conversations, enjoying topics like music, art, and science. It displays a slight interest in the SCP Foundation, although it is likely this is because of its immediate surroundings, and not for malevolent reasons.

SCP-598 is not a physical organism- it does not move, grow, eat, sleep, or excrete waste, so it is not technically alive. Any color-accurate copy of SCP-598, reproduced by any means including computer, video recording or mirrors, will become SCP-598. 

An interesting phenomena occurs whenever any short-wave radio is within 4 meters of SCP-598. They will begin to pick up a previously out-of-range station which will broadcast different noises.

As of yet, the following have been recorded:
* Wolf-like howling
* Whale song
* Frogs croaking, punctuated by insect sounds
* Low humming of unknown origin
* High-pitched chirping noises, revealed to be bat noises brought into human hearing frequencies

SCP-598 does not seem to know where these noises originate, yet enjoys a radio placed in the room and tuned to this frequency. The noises change at random, and go on for hours at a time.


**Addendum:**

It has been suggested by Dr. ███████████ that a sample of SCP-598 be introduced to [[[SCP-085]]]. Pending approval by overseers and all involved parties.
