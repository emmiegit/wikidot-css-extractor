**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6151 has been transferred to the Staff break room of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5951 the Miami Walmart Supercenter]. While civilian interaction with SCP-6151 is banned, members of Stationary Task Force Kappa-51 (“Always Low Prices”) are encouraged to patronize the object if not considered a risk to their mental wellbeing. All communications regarding SCP-6151 to PoI-792 (&#34;Martin Greaze&#34;) are to be headed by Dr. Kensing, and occur on an at least bimonthly basis to ensure proper containment.

**Description:** SCP-6151 is a hotdog vending machine of a previously unknown brand, which spontaneously manifested in the Miami Walmart Supercenter following an extended period of detente between the SCP Foundation and [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/back-to-your-irregularly-scheduled-programming Greazeburger Incorporated]. All buttons on SCP-6151 display the word &#39;Greaze&#39;, as well as a variable cost between $2.50 and $2.75, although testing has shown no difference in anomalous effect nor taste between each option.

When the appropriate amount of currency is inserted into SCP-6151 and a button is pressed an outwardly non-anomalous hotdog will be dispensed, despite this being mechanically impossible.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Internal imaging shows the inside of SCP-6151 is composed of haphazardly placed mechanical parts, a car battery, flesh and Greazeburger^^TM^^ Legally Distinct Void Byproducts.[[/span]] Upon consumption, the consumer will fall unconscious for approximately 15 seconds, with no other adverse physical side effects following reawakening. The subject (Henceforth referred to as SCP-6151-1) will experience extreme time dilation during this, recording the period to last anywhere between several weeks and millennia, with a median experienced time of 14 years. During this, SCP-6151-1 instances report extended conversations with a figure claiming to be Martin Greaze, largely focusing on Greazeburger Incorporated and lessons in business management.
