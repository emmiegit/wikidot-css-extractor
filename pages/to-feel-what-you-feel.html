[[[scp-2721|Eli]]] only had to wait for thirteen seconds. It had expected the ritual to snap it into PIC&#39;s body instantaneously, but it had instead happened slowly, a fade from its place behind Earth&#39;s Luna to a body of flesh and blood, of sinew and bone.

The first sense to come was sight, but PIC had closed his eyes, so there wasn&#39;t much to see just yet.

The second was hearing. Eli heard the buzz of a desk fan somewhere to its left. It heard the chirping of birds outside, dampened by a closed window. It heard someone, presumably Jude, move slightly. His clothes rubbed against a carpet, creating a scratchy sort of sound. Every sound was so much more noticeable, so much //more//, with human ears to catch them.

The third sense was feeling. A slight wind passed by it, likely the fan oscillating. The air ruffled its sleeve, rubbing the plush fabric against PIC&#39;s arm- its arm, for now. A silky substance passed through its fingers, falling to the floor. It felt like what Eli imagined sand to feel like. The air in the room was wet and heavy, something it didn&#39;t know air could be.

It took a breath in. The fourth sense was scent. There were only two distinct scents Eli could put words to, the rest a muddled, warm musk. A soft scent cut through it first, something misty and comforting. It reminded it of how its friend Lily described the scents of flowers. The other scent was much fainter, but it was there. Something much more damp and pungent, that reminded it of what swamps and marshes look like.

The last was taste. There wasn&#39;t much there, as Eli wasn&#39;t eating anything, but there was a slight pang on its tongue. PIC had probably eaten something sour or spicy, going off of what it knew of how its friends described those tastes.

Eli opened its eyes, taking in the room. It was bare, with nothing notable in its view. Jude was directly across from it, watching it as it took long, deep breaths, adjusting to now having lungs and hands and a human body, at least for now.

There was a difference, it now fully understood, in how it saw the world compared to how humans did. It had seen pictures of Jude, but with him sitting in front of it, it could see details it had never noticed before. His sclerae were tinted red, irritation from smoking marijuana. His hair was dry and thin, hidden under a large grey ushanka. There was a small stain on the front of his hoodie, one knee of his jeans was torn with threads stretched across, his socks were dirty with sweat.

Eli took another breath in as it realized just how much it had been missing. Just how much it had never realized it didn&#39;t have, how much it never would have known it wanted at all. Jude continued to watch quietly, letting it adjust as the sandy substance continued to sift through its fingers.

Then it twitched a finger. One, then two, then it clenched all five into a fist. It was a strange feeling, to control a limb it had never had before, but the feeling came naturally. Most likely, it was part of the ritual, as breathing had come just as naturally. Eli extended its fingers, letting the rest of the debris fall to the floor, the grains filtering through the threads and all but disappearing.

It reached up and out, shakily, towards Jude. It wanted to feel his hands, to feel another person&#39;s, its friend&#39;s, skin against its own. Jude understood what it was doing and closed the distance, slowly touching his fingers to Eli&#39;s. It pulled back at first, but then took Jude&#39;s hand in its, running its fingers over his rough skin.

&#34;How is it?&#34; Jude asked, speaking softly as he let Eli caress his hand. It took another breath.

&#34;It...&#34; PIC&#39;s voice was a bit strained, though that was likely from Eli&#39;s inexperience in speaking with a physical voice. Jude leaned in, listening intently. The damp scent from earlier was stronger, and it felt its facial muscles contract. &#34;Stinks.&#34; Jude laughed at that, leaning back again.

&#34;Sorry. I was smoking when PIC asked me to come over. Speaking of...&#34; Jude let go of Eli&#39;s hand, reaching into the pocket of his hoodie. He pulled out a small object, one that Eli recognized as a joint.

&#34;He asked me to bring one so I could offer it to you.&#34; Jude smiled, and Eli felt its chest grow warmer. It knew it felt happy, and it knew that people described happiness as feeling &#34;warm and fuzzy&#34;, so it knew that must be what it was feeling. It was nice.

&#34;I&#39;m...not sure.&#34; Eli had heard some of the others describe their difficulties the first time they smoked, and having never had a body before, it didn&#39;t feel comfortable smoking.

&#34;That&#39;s cool.&#34; Jude put the joint back in his pocket. &#34;I figured you&#39;d say no anyways.&#34;

Eli and Jude sat in silence for a moment. It was nice. It ran its hands over the soft fabric of its jacket, the rough shag of the carpet, the stiff denim of its pants. It all felt so nice. It listened to the birds sing outside, and the fan buzz from its spot on the floor. It smelled the soft, flowery scent again.

&#34;What&#39;s that smell?&#34; Eli couldn&#39;t see a flower anywhere in the room. Jude raised an eyebrow, and it clarified, &#34;Not the weed.&#34;

&#34;Oh, this?&#34; Jude picked up a small glass jar, turning it slightly to show the wax and lit wick inside. A candle. &#34;I asked JJ what kind of scent I should get. Lucky guess?&#34;

Eli took the candle in its hands. The glass was hot, but not hot enough to burn. It held the candle close enough for the flame&#39;s heat to radiate onto its face and sniffed deeply. The scent was much stronger this close, but it was just as soft and comforting, enveloping its mind in the same plush feeling as the jacket.

Jude didn&#39;t interrupt. The moment lasted a long while, with Eli content to smell the scent of flowers, something it had wanted to do for so long. Only once the candle became too hot to hold did it put it back onto the floor. The sandy substance from earlier was still in the carpet.

&#34;Thank you.&#34; Eli spoke up after an extended, but comfortable, silence.

&#34;No problem,&#34; Jude said, waving his hand dismissively. &#34;But if you want to thank someone, thank PIC. He came up with the idea, and had the book.&#34;

&#34;I will do that.&#34; Eli did its best to smile, an effort which Jude reciprocated with one of his own. The pair spent the rest of the time given by the ritual in silence, neither feeling a need to say anything, giving Eli the chance to fully focus on the sensory experiences before they faded away, and it was back behind Earth&#39;s Luna, in the vast expanse of space.

It felt a bit colder now.

**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** Hey
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** Did you find this through the page source?
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** Eh, doesn&#39;t matter
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** I&#39;m gonna talk about my relationship with writing
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** You don&#39;t have to listen, feel free to close the collapsible
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** This is sort of just a catharsis for me
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** After all, writing is inherently selfish
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** It&#39;s about sharing //our// experiences, //our// thoughts with the world
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** Even fanfic, which is based on other people&#39;s worlds, is written because someone wants to share their own ideas about that world
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** That&#39;s not a bad thing
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** Just because something is a little selfish doesn&#39;t mean other people can&#39;t connect with it
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** I wrote this tale because I wanted to write about GAW
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** Then I thought about expanding on Cerastes&#39; tale, [[[I Just Want To Get Away From Me]]]
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** And then it turned into an exercise in describing things more, because I tend to make my stories really short by avoiding long descriptions
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** Just because I wrote the tale for me, doesn&#39;t mean you didn&#39;t get something out of it, right?
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** I mean, maybe you didn&#39;t
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** I don&#39;t know you
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** I don&#39;t even know that your user is %%title%%, that&#39;s just ListUsers
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** But I digress
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** God that makes me sound so pretentious lol
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** Doesn&#39;t matter
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** Where was I?
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** Right, writing
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** I don&#39;t finish a lot of stories
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** Most of the time I end up either writing myself into a corner or I just lose interest
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** I&#39;ve probably written more words than are in the entirety of the...
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** Well, I was gonna say the Harry Potter series but I don&#39;t know how many words are in that
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** I&#39;ve written a lot, is what I was trying to say, but none of it will ever see the light of day
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** Ooh, bars
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** One of the few times I&#39;ve actually posted something I&#39;ve written is [[[SCP-7361|7361]]]
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** It&#39;s not great, though
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** I coldposted it like, an hour after I wrote it
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** There&#39;s a lot I would&#39;ve changed if I had waited to post it
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** But I also might not have ever been satisfied with it, and it would&#39;ve entered my little draft graveyard
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** So I&#39;m not going to rewrite it
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** It&#39;s a shaky, stumbly, awkward first step, but it //is// a first step
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** Sometimes you just gotta eat shit on a sidewalk to get going, you know?
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** I lost my train of thought, and rereading what I just typed didn&#39;t help get it back, so I&#39;m gonna talk about something else
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** I&#39;ve been scared to turn 20
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** My birthday&#39;s February 1st
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** I don&#39;t know when I&#39;m posting this, but I hope I get it done before then, cuz otherwise this part won&#39;t really matter that much
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** There&#39;s a lot I haven&#39;t done, but that&#39;s okay
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** I&#39;ve still got a good 70 or so years to go
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** Unless I get hit by a car or something
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** And even if being 20 sucks, this community will be here
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** There&#39;s thousands of skips I haven&#39;t read yet
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** There&#39;s hundreds of tales and GoI formats
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** And there&#39;s thousands of people to talk to, once I work up the courage
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** Everyone builds on what everyone else writes, and then that gets built on too
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** I guess that&#39;s why it&#39;s called the Foundation, huh?
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** Maybe that&#39;s just a coincidence though
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** If I was religious I might say it was the work of a god
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** I&#39;ll ask around when I die
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** Anyway
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** I&#39;m rambling
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** I guess you&#39;re still here if you&#39;re reading this, huh?
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** I should give you something
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** Hm
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** Listen to //Pelicans We// by Cosmo Sheldrake
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** It&#39;s a nice song
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** ...
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** I guess that&#39;s it
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** Good luck out there, %%title%%
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** Life gets better, I promise
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** No matter how much it sucks right now
**###FE2984|MrMeltingPoint:##** Thank you for reading this
