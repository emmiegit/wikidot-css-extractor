&gt; {{**RESPONSIBLE PERSONNEL:** Igor S. Petlyar к.т.н.}}
&gt; {{**DETAIL:** OSI &#34;FLY AGARIC&#34; is the designation of a subspecies of //Fomes fomentarius//, provisionally designated //Fomes fomentarius copiosus//. The appearance, habitat and nutrition of //F. fomentarius copiosus// resembles that of its superspecies, and sample combustion analysis shows no differences in composition.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{//F. fomentarius copiosus// has been designated object of special interest due to abnormal traits associated with the growth and physical properties of its fruit body.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{The mycelium of //F. fomentarius copiosus// does not appear to penetrate significantly into the host, with very limited saprotrophic activity; the characteristic areas of decomposing wood demarcated by pseudosclerotic layers are all but absent. Long-term studies of specimens on host wood segments in a sealed chamber have shown that there is net mass gain as the specimens&#39; fruit bodies grow and mature; this suggests the specimen obtains nutrients from elsewhere.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{In addition, the fruit body of //F. fomentarius copiosus//  exhibits atomism. An attempt to remove a section thereof results in no change to the volume or mass of the fruit body, however, a segment identical to that of a similarly cut control sample of //F. fomentarius// is produced, independant of the direction of the cut. This property is not preserved in the removed segment. }}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Setting fire to a fruit body causes it to combust until extinguished, while spontaneously increasing in mass and volume at a rate of cca. 20g/hour, with ash and fragments detaching. No spontaneous upper limit was observed as of now, with longest experiment running for three (3) months and achieving a combined debris mass of ~40kg}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{See Appendix A for data on occurence. The species appears endemic to forests in the Mordovian ASSR.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{ Proposed uses:}}
&gt; {{@@       (i) Cheap supply of fuel@@ - REJECTED. High water content and resistance of fruit bodies to dessication; segments can be processed as normal but limited economic value due to labour requirements.}}
&gt; {{@@       (ii) Felt production@@ - APPROVED - cheap and expedient material collection. Comrade I. Kalugin commended; by estimate, could help to exceed felt production targets by 135%. Test run of felt to be produced and thoroughly tested by  01. I. 1967.}}

&gt; {{**IVF:** Here... }}
&gt; {{**R:** Ivan Vasilievic Fedorov, is it? Alright, comrade Fedorov. It says here you were an operator on the third section. You are aware there&#39;s been a fire at your workplace two days ago? }}
&gt; {{**IVF:** If this is why... I didn&#39;t do anything! I was in the pub the evening, just ask Sergej, Misha or Leonid. And then went home, my wife can- }}
&gt; {{**R:** Calm down, comrade. We haven&#39;t accused you of anything. And I&#39;ll be frank with you, we don&#39;t suspect the factory staff - there&#39;s a few ideas out there as to how the accident came about, and all I&#39;m here to do is to clear up a couple details. So, let&#39;s get this over with, eh? }}
&gt; {{**IVF:** Alright.}}
&gt; {{**R:** Excellent. Now, your documents say &#39;operator&#39; but that&#39;s a wide term. What exactly is it that you do here? }}
&gt; {{**IVF:** I&#39;m... I run the cutter.}}
&gt; {{**R:** What cutter? Tell me in detail.}}
&gt; {{**IVF:** Well, it&#39;s the cutter. You stuff in a trunk, it gets cut into planks, they get bathed, shaped,  then out to dry. I&#39;m the one who keeps it fed and cutting at the right rate and all that. }}
&gt; {{**R:** Bathed?}}
&gt; {{**IVF:** Yeah. It&#39;s some stuff that prevents the wood from going foul. Impregnation, that&#39;s the fancy name for it. See, we&#39;re first class, our planks go for floors and cupboards and all that. Furniture. }}
&gt; {{**R:** Alright. Now, for the classic. Did you notice anything unusual during the last shift?}}
&gt; {{**IVF:** Not really. It all went swimmingly, given the crap they trucked to us. I swear, comrade, they want us to plait a whip from shit, when you look at the targets and material. }}
&gt; {{**R:** Who does?}}
&gt; {{**IVF:** Everyone. But this is the lumber folks&#39; fault. Half the trunks they sent us were obviously trushy, all hiding under the nice ones. The shit is supposed to go for firewood. So when we- uh. }}
&gt; {{**R:** Go on. }}
&gt; {{**IVF:** Well...}}
&gt; {{**R:** Listen, I won&#39;t pull this out from you like threads from a felt blanket. I&#39;ll assume you didn&#39;t bother to reject the crap they sent you, or notify your boss. I don&#39;t care - we&#39;re not workplace malpractice committee. Now, carry on and cut the crap. }}
&gt; {{**IVF:** Yeah, you got it. See, if we did anything it&#39;d fuck up with our factory trying to get awards for exceeding targets - and our bonuses would go to hell. So we cut it anyways and hoped nobody will notice the discoloration anytime soon, or if they do, they&#39;ll keep hush about it. After all, it&#39;s not our fault - they can go cry at the suppliers. }}
&gt; {{**R:** I suppose.}}
&gt; {{**IVF:** But, this is where it gets interesting! A couple of us were kinda nervous about it, and went to inspect the planks coming out - see, there&#39;s a couple things you can do to make such damage a bit less obvious. But, the wood came out fine. I wouldn&#39;t have believed by looking at the bark, but the trush hasn&#39;t eaten through at all, no lines, good colour, good hardness, all! So on paper it was all fine - nobody could blame us for pushing forwards wood that looks alright by the spec.}}
&gt; {{**R:** I see. Anything else you noticed? }}
&gt; {{**IVF:** Not really. I was happy enough how we put one over the fuckers, then went to have a couple drinks to celebrate after the shift... and after in the morning, I heard there was a fire overnight. }}
&gt; {{**R:** Thank you comrade, that will be all. I might show up again for you to sign a statement, but, until then.}}

&gt; {{**DETAIL**: Since its discovery, further work was carried out on //Fomus fomentarius copiosus// specimens, motivated by the incident described in document 32-II-1966. The main experimental results follow:
&gt; The use of a systemic fungicide on //Fomus fomentarius copiosus// specimen exhibiting atomism results in the reification of copious amounts of dead //F. fomentarius copiosus// tissues. The tissue reifies in a timescale corresponding to the absorbtion of such a fungicide and the manifestation of its effects, as confirmed by testing control group //F. fomentarius// specimens.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{The amount of reified tissue has been found to be a function of the live mass of the fruit body prior to application. Experimentation with small fruit bodies has revealed the following empirical relationship assuming fungicide saturation: m,,r,, = me^^m/K^^, where m,,r,, is the reified mass, m the original mass of the fruit body and K = 6.046 grams; valid for fruit bodies above ~5g.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Attempting to repeatedly section such bodies have shown the same limit to apply to the anomalous pseudo-atomist behaviour (termed //fomoid atomism// further on) discovered earlier - after being sectioned  457 times, the cca. 50g experimental sample ceased to reify fungal matter.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Coupled with known information regarding the mycelium of //F. fomentarius copiosus//, the prevalent hypothesis at the time is that the tissues of a //F. fomentarius copiosus// grow out in a spatial direction perpendicular to the unit vectors of 3-space, with dead or removed tissue being detached and forced into the local point by mass of surrounding matter, which manifests as it reifying. These findings are consistent with 4-space theory proposed by academician G. Chutayev. The focus of current research is to examine the pressure of tissue reification as means of verifying stated hypothesis - if valid, the pressure curve should show linear decrease with amount of tissue reified.}}
