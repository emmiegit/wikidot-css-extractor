[[collapsible show=&#34;[INPUT LEVEL 5 SECURITY CREDENTIALS]&#34; hide=&#34;[CONFIRMED]&#34;]]

**Item#:** SCP-3545

**Object Class:** Safe (Presumed Euclid)

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3545 is to be housed in a standard containment locker in Site-19. Object should be secured with Level 2 Clearance and monitored while its effects are better understood. 

//Note: Concerns over the frailty of the object have lead to SCP-3545&#39;s containment locker being fit with a felt-lined indentation in which the object is to be placed.//

**Discovery:** {{[DATA PURGED PER O5 REQUEST]}}

**Description:** SCP-3545 is the designation for an antique crystal drinking glass of unknown origin. The glass itself appears to be comprised of non-anomalous material. Thus, proper care must be taken when handling the item.

SCP-3545 bears no identifying marks or artist etchings and exact dating has yielded inconsistent results.

When an individual maintains direct eye contact with SCP-3545 and forms a mental image of the glass, it will begin filling with an unknown substance. The liquid that manifests within SCP-3545 absorbs all visible light and will appear completely black to the human eye. During this process, the contents of the glass cannot be accessed by any means and will appear non-corporeal. The substance will slowly replace any liquid already in the glass.

SCP-3545 will fill completely within five minutes of sustained focus, but this is not recommended, as the process has shown to have detrimental neurological consequences, with subsequent interactions having increased potential for adverse effects. All personnel assigned to the study of SCP-3545 are to leave the testing area before discussing findings to minimize unwanted exposure.

When SCP-3545 is full, the liquid can be removed from the glass via ingestion. No other methods have proven capable of removing the contents of the glass, and attempts to retrieve consumed liquids have failed. Upon ingestion of the substance, subjects become instantaneously aware of a sequence of 18-24 numbers. The relevance of these numbers is currently not known, and testing is ongoing. A complete list of the results of testing can be found below.

= __**Experiment Log 3545-A**__

||~ Designation ||~ Result ||~ Sequence ||
|| D-8121 || Subject filled and consumed contents successfully. Could not describe taste. Experienced mild headaches for the following day. Sequence recorded successfully. || {{[DATA PURGED PER O5 REQUEST]}} ||
|| D-0330 || Subject expressed difficulty concentrating on object. Focus aid was administered and D-0330 was able to complete the process shortly thereafter. Described taste as &#34;floral&#34;. Experienced no negative effects. Sequence recorded without incident. || {{[DATA PURGED PER O5 REQUEST]}} ||
|| D-44211 || Subject filled and consumed contents, complaining of a foul taste. D-Class unable to elaborate on taste any further. Experienced major epistaxis shortly afterwards. Full recovery was seen within an hour. Sequence recorded successfully. || {{[DATA PURGED PER O5 REQUEST]}} ||
|| D-6325 || Subject filled and consumed contents. Described the taste as &#34;earthy&#34;. Experienced auditory and visual hallucinations sporadically over the next 36 hours. Sequence was recorded without issue.|| {{[DATA PURGED PER O5 REQUEST]}} ||
|| D-9921 || Filling SCP-3545 took several minutes longer than expected, as subject fell asleep several times during their efforts. D-9921 claimed to feel very fatigued when concentrating on the object. Upon consumption, subject screamed and doubled over, gagging. Subject vomited violently for several minutes before going into shock. After euthanizing subject, autopsy revealed extensive burns on the inside of the esophagus and stomach. The reason for this is not known. Sequence unable to be acquired. || None ||
|| D-4106 || Test proceeded without incident. Subject was extremely cooperative throughout. Upon consumption of liquid, D-4106 described the taste as &#34;divine&#34; but would not elaborate further. Sequence obtained without issue. Subject requested further testing with object. Request was approved by project head. || {{[DATA PURGED PER O5 REQUEST]}} ||
|| D-4106 || Test proceeded identically as the previous. Subject experienced minor epistaxis but requested further testing. Request was approved. || {{[DATA PURGED PER O5 REQUEST]}} ||
|| D-4106 || Upon consumption of the liquid, subject appeared confused. When questioned, D-4106 remarked that the taste was &#34;awfully dark&#34; before collapsing in apparent seizure. Subject expired via cerebral hemorrhage shortly afterwards. Sequence not acquired. || None ||
|| D-9866 || Subject filled SCP-3545 without complaint. After consumption, D-9866 remarked that the taste was harsh and smelled of gasoline. Subject appeared to be intoxicated for several hours afterwards. Sequence recorded and subject sent for bloodwork and tox screening. Results inconclusive. || {{[DATA PURGED PER O5 REQUEST]}} ||
|| D-9866 || Test repeated to attempt to replicate result. Subject expressed complaints of tinnitus and fatigue during test. D-9866 consumed the contents and described the taste as &#34;██████&#34;. Sequence obtained and found to be different than that of the previous test. Subject appeared listless after testing, and disappeared from their quarters twelve hours later. Subject has not been recovered.|| {{[DATA PURGED PER O5 REQUEST]}} ||

[[tab ▶ REVISED PROTOCOL 3545.1]]
 [[collapsible show=&#34;[INPUT LEVEL 5 SECURITY CREDENTIALS]&#34; hide=&#34;[CONFIRMED]&#34;]]

**Item#:** SCP-3545

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** New instances of SCP-3545-1 are to be anticipated and cordoned off using the standard containment protocol most suited for the region in which the anomaly manifests. 

Due to the fragility of the object, SCP-3545 is to be kept in a standard containment locker in Site-19, retrofitted with a felt-lined indentation in which the object should be placed. SCP-3545&#39;s chamber is to be secured with Level 3 clearance and Site Director approval is necessary before testing can be authorized. 

**Description:** SCP-3545 is the designation for an antique crystal drinking glass of unknown origin. The glass itself is seemingly comprised of non-anomalous material; therefore, great care must be taken to ensure the object&#39;s safety.

Although mostly unremarkable, a combination of direct observation and mental focus will cause SCP-3545 to fill with an unknown liquid of varying viscosity and taste. Liquid appears to absorb all light in the visual spectrum and appears entirely black to the human eye.

On average, five minutes of sustained focus on the object will cause it to fill completely. The contents of the object cannot be removed from the glass during this point, and will appear non-corporeal. The substance will slowly replace any liquid already in the glass.

While focusing on SCP-3545, individuals are subject to sporadic cases of nosebleeds, confusion, convulsions, narcolepsy and hallucinations. Repeated exposure has been shown to cause permanent trauma and brain damage.

When SCP-3545 has been completely filled, it will emit a low hum and glow lightly. The liquid cannot be removed from the glass except by ingestion. Upon consuming the contents of SCP-3545, the subject will instantaneously become aware of a sequence of 18-24 numbers. Through extensive testing, it has been deduced that the numbers are two sets of four-vector coordinates that refer to specific points in four-dimensional spacetime[[footnote]]Three spacial dimensions, one temporal.[[/footnote]], relative to the location of SCP-3545. These points mark the outer boundaries in which an anomaly, designated SCP-3545-1, will occur within our own reality. 



SCP-3545-1 instances appear non anomalous in most ways. Instances are colloquially defined as a perfect orthotope of space for a set period of time, however, they can also be viewed as octahedral (Schläfli symbol {4,3,3}) given their fourth-dimensional nature (See **Figure A**). 

[[include component:image-block name=figa.png|caption=SCP-3545-1 instance represented in three dimensional space.]]

Upon the manifestation of SCP-3545-1, individuals who travel through the boundaries and out the opposite side will find themselves transported to an alternate location (See **Figure B**). 

[[include component:image-block name=figb.png|caption=Passing through the SCP-3545-1 instance.]]

From an outside perspective, the individual traversing an instance of SCP-3545-1 will not appear to leave or deviate from their path, and will reach and exit the other side of the anomaly as expected. Upon exiting the area of effect, individuals retain a nascent awareness of their experiences, but due to a mild antimemetic effect, often do not remember having left any location, nor their return. The experience has been described as &#34;dream-like&#34;.

Mnestic drugs have no effect on individuals affected by SCP-3545-1 instances. Tachyons, measured in burst patterns during manifestation and interaction, have led to the conclusion that this memory-alteration may occur due to changes in retroactive causality. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that those within SCP-3545-1&#39;s boundaries experience their dislocation before it is triggered (i.e. Reality warping effects occur only if the individual will pass through the other side. Individuals sent into the area and told to return experience no changes, but those with //intent// and //capacity// to do so experience the event at some point during their time within the anomaly.) 

Although the effect of SCP-3545-1 is not visible to an outside observer, and those within often experience significant memory loss, video and audio recording still functions with varying degrees of success, subject to the specific reality entered into. More info can be found below.

&gt; **Abstract:** To survey and analyze the interior of a SCP-3545-1 manifestation. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Assigned:** D-4812
&gt; 
&gt; **Additional Information:** The following is an audiovisual transcript of the events after obtaining a sequence from SCP-3545. D-Class consuming liquid described the taste as &#34;dry and gritty&#34;. Sequence analyzed and found to be referring to a stretch of highway 10km across near the Colombia Basin in eastern Washington. Subject was placed in a vehicle with dashboard/cabin cameras and was instructed to drive through SCP-3545-1 instance.
&gt; 
&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Alright. D-4812, can you hear me okay?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-4812:** Yeah. It feels nice to drive, didn&#39;t think I&#39;d ever do that again.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Noted. Can you describe your surroundings? For the record.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-4812:** Sure. Not much to see, really. This side of Washington is all deserts from what I know. What am I supposed to be looking for?
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Just.. Anything out of the ordinary.
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject does not respond and appears to survey the surrounding area. Car traverses SCP-3545-1 without issue for several minutes.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-4812:** Am I allowed to turn on the radio? Would be nice to listen to some music.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** That&#39;s fine. Not too loud though.
&gt; 
&gt; //D-4812 is seen switching on the radio. It expresses static. Subject changes stations, but all yield the same result. D-4812 starts bobbing head to the noise enthusiastically, raising the volume.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-4812:** Aw, man, this is my favorite song! Nice.
&gt; 
&gt; //Control notes this and decides not to question subject.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-4812:** [discordant humming]
&gt; 
&gt; //Camera goes black. A second later, the camera comes back online, D-4812 now driving along a stretch of wooded forests at night. Subject seems unaware of this change.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** D-4812, please describe your situation.
&gt; 
&gt; //D-4812 is unresponsive. Camera shows subject looking bored and unsurprised during this period. Dash camera unable to discern much of outside area due to darkness.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** D-4812, do you copy?
&gt; 
&gt; //No response from subject. D-4812 continues to drive for several minutes in silence. Soon after, D-4812 laughs loudly and looks at the passenger seat, which is off camera.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-4812:** No, I don&#39;t know why. You tell me! [laughing]
&gt; 
&gt; //At this point, an unknown voice originating from the passenger seat speaks. Reflection of the window shows the presence of a humanoid figure bearing no discernible facial features. Figure talks in a clipped, distorted tone.//
&gt; 
&gt; **??????:** Remember me?
&gt; 
&gt; //Reflection shows figure peeling off its own face. Underneath lies D-4812&#39;s face. Subject seems undaunted by this.//
&gt; 
&gt; **??????:** I needed you, you know. Back at the house.
&gt; 
&gt; //Behind the subject, a large white flash takes over the camera&#39;s view. When it returns, subject is seen walking down a tiled corridor. Vehicle is not present, and cameras appear to be fixed in space where they would sit. Outside of SCP-3545-1, aerial drone surveillance shows D-4812 driving normally, albeit slower than he had been previously.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject continues to stroll down the corridor. Sounds of echoing footsteps can be heard as D-4812 approaches the other end. A single doorway presents itself to the subject, who hesitates slightly before turning knob.//
&gt; 
&gt; **??????:** Don&#39;t leave! Dance with me. 
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject turns around to find a young woman in a black dress, confirmed later as D-4812&#39;s late wife. Subject appears startled and confused.//
&gt; 
&gt; **??????:** You&#39;ve forgotten how, haven&#39;t you?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-4812:** Sarah? N-No, I haven&#39;t.
&gt; 
&gt; **??????:**  Then why do you leave?
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject appears distressed. Figure gives a small twirl.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-4812:** I didn&#39;t leave. I-I mean, I didn&#39;t mean to. It was an accident! I&#39;m sorry!
&gt; 
&gt; **??????:** Then stay with me. I need you.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-4812:** I can&#39;t. I wish I could, but I can&#39;t.
&gt; 
&gt; //Figure stops moving and stares at subject. After a moment, her head wrenches back as she emits a scream of agony and bursts into flames. Subject seen hiding his face in his hands, crying.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-4812:** Please. Leave me alone! [sobs]
&gt; 
&gt; //Shortly afterwards, D-4812 crosses the outer boundary of SCP-3545-1 and &#34;wakes up&#34;. Subject experiences no memory of the prior events, but remains in a depressive state until termination. Records indicate D-4812 was incarcerated for arson and homicide.//

&gt; **Abstract:** To survey and analyze the interior of a SCP-3545-1 instance, compare results to that of the previous test.
&gt; 
&gt; **Assigned:** D-1121
&gt; 
&gt; **Additional Information:** The following is an audiovisual transcript of the events after obtaining a second sequence from SCP-3545. D-Class consuming liquid described the taste as &#34;refreshing&#34; but could not elaborate further. Sequence analyzed and found to be referring to a small patch of the Pacific Ocean several hundred kilometers off the coast of Hokkaido, Japan. Subject was placed on a personal water craft retrofitted with several cameras and instructed to drive through the instance. 
&gt; 
&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; //Cameras flick on to reveal vast expanses of ocean in all directions. Subject is seen driving the boat towards a Foundation vessel stationed on the opposite side of SCP-3545-1.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-1121:** Uh, I&#39;m not seeing anything out here. It&#39;s just water in all directions. I see you.
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject waves.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** And we have eyes on you as well, let us know if you see anything unusual.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-1121:** Yeah, will do.
&gt; 
&gt; //D-1121 is seen glancing around. After a short period of time, she stops. Subject sits in silence for approximately one minute. During this time, the water around the craft appears to thicken and become gelatinous. The speed of the craft is unaffected by this. Subject continues to stare in silence. Another minute later, subject speaks.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-1121:** Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;re perfectly safe out here.
&gt; 
&gt; //A figure manifests behind D-1121. Subject glances back and smiles. Figure appears to be a male in his twenties and speaks in the same strange, clipped tone. Entity has facial features but exact details of these features seem to fluctuate in shape, position and complexity without discernable cause.//
&gt; 
&gt; **??????:** Ah, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ve never been this far out before. I can&#39;t even see the shore!
&gt; 
&gt; **D-1121:** Out there, don&#39;t you see it?
&gt; 
&gt; //Figure is seen leaning off the side of the boat. D-1121 lunges at them and pushes them over, burying their head beneath the ocean. Subject holds them there until the thrashing subsides, and then tosses the body overboard.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-1121:** What&#39;s done is done. [laughs]
&gt; 
&gt; //A deep drone is heard as a dark shape rises out of the thick sludge. A black sphere is seen, which pulses and flashes a white light that engulfs all cameras. Subject is heard screaming. When the light recedes, all cameras record pitch black feeds. From outside of the anomaly, subject appears in deep sleep and craft is no longer moving. To prevent any ontological paradoxes that may arise, a recon unit was dispatched from the opposite boundaries to pull D-1121 through the other side before the manifestation ends.//
&gt; 
&gt; //After successful reconnaissance, D-1121 remained in a vegetative state for a week. Upon awakening, subject displayed signs of severe PTSD and depersonalization. D-1121 has retained no memory of her time within SCP-3545-1.//

**Item#:** SCP-3545

**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** New instances of SCP-3545-1 are to be anticipated and cordoned off using the standard containment protocol most suited for the region in which the anomaly manifests. Instances are not to be interacted with at any time. 

The object itself is to be stored in a Maximum Security Containment Chamber in {{[DATA PURGED PER O5 REQUEST]}} and secured with Level 4 clearance. Chamber is to be fitted with a felt-lined indentation in which the object is stored when not in use. Testing with the object for other than its primary thaumaturgic purpose is currently suspended. 


**Description:** SCP-3545 is the designation for an antique crystal drinking glass of unknown origin. The glass itself is comprised of non-anomalous material and thus great care must be taken to ensure the object&#39;s safety.

Although mostly unremarkable, a combination of direct observation and mental focus causes SCP-3545 to fill with an unknown substance of varying viscosity and taste. Liquid appears to absorb all light in the visual spectrum and appears entirely black to the human eye. Limited testing revealed the object is capable of absorbing ionizing radiation using a heretofore unheard of chemical process involving {{[DATA PURGED PER O5 REQUEST]}}. More information on the subject can be acquired via approval of Site Director.

On average, five minutes of sustained mental focus on the object will cause it to fill completely. The contents of the object cannot be removed from the glass during this point. While focusing on SCP-3545, individuals are subject to sporadic cases of nosebleeds, confusion, convulsions, narcolepsy and hallucinations. Repeated exposure compounds this effect. 

When SCP-3545 has been completely filled, it will emit a low hum and glow lightly. --The liquid cannot be removed from the glass except by ingestion-- **See Incident Report 3545-001**. Upon consuming the contents of SCP-3545, the subject will instantaneously become aware of two sets of four-value coordinates. These coordinates relate specifically to the location and time of the manifestation of a localized ZK-Class Reality Failure Event, referred to as SCP-3545-1. 

The location in which SCP-3545-1 appears will experience a sharp drop in Hume levels several seconds leading up to its manifestation. Upon manifestation of the instance, area will continue to exhibit abnormal Hume levels, but will not show any outward, visible, or tangible fluctuations.

If an individual will successfully pass through the instance at some point, they will experience a hallucinogenic episode before they leave the area defined by SCP-3545. This is considered a byproduct of individuals&#39; brains compensating for the lack of reality experienced within SCP-3545-1. This episode will then project itself within the individual&#39;s vicinity.

SCP-3545 is to be utilized in tracking and identifying places where SCP-3545-1 instances will manifest. D-Class personnel are to be used to acquire as many sequences as possible for this purpose.

= __**Incident Report 3545-001**__

**SCP involved:** SCP-3545

**Personnel involved:** Dr. Robert █████, Jr. Researcher [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/richard-larenz-personal-log Pyotr Vasilev], Sr. Researcher James A. Harkness, 7 Class-D Personnel

**Date:** ██/██/██

**Location:** {{[DATA PURGED PER O5 REQUEST]}}

**Preface:** At 08:00 on ██/██/██, Site-███ was attacked and infiltrated by several members of a [[[chaos-insurgency-hub|Chaos Insurgency]]] division. Individuals possessed intimate knowledge of the layout of the facility, gaining access to SCP-3545&#39;s research and containment chambers. At the time, several staff members and a handful Class-D personnel were present and collecting sequences from the object. The following is a transcript of video surveillance footage taken from the chamber.

&gt; 
&gt; 08:15 - A blast is seen shaking the containment area. Security doors to the left appeared to have buckled. Staff attempt to evacuate but find other set of doors sealed due to automatic emergency protocols.
&gt; 
&gt; 08:18 - Several masked Chaos Insurgency members enter screen left. All possess modified Foundation tactical wear and standard issue Mobile Task Force gear. Individuals hold personnel at gunpoint and secure SCP-3545.
&gt; 
&gt; 08:20 - A small scuffle ensues in an attempt to subdue attackers. D-8212 fatally wounded via gunshot.
&gt; 
&gt; 08:25 - Insurgency members restrain all individuals. Personnel are moved to a circle around an examination table, where SCP-3545 is placed.
&gt; 
&gt; 08:32 - Attackers appear to force individuals to fill object. Once the glass fills, one assailant produces a number of flasks and a syringe that resembles {{[DATA PURGED PER O5 REQUEST]}}. Using this object, liquid is extracted from the glass and placed in a flask. The process repeats. 
&gt; 
&gt; 08:42 - D-3244 loses consciousness and starts convulsing. D-7180 appears to be delirious and is seen frequently speaking to the empty space on his right. Dr. █████ is seen visibly bleeding from the ears. Sr. Researcher Harkness is visibly frightened but unaffected, a fact that he later attributed to his high cognitohazard resistance (See [http://www.scp-wiki.net/sr-researcher-james-a-harkness-personnel-file his personnel file] for more information).
&gt;   
&gt; 08:48 - Insurgency member shoots D-7180 in the head. Another D-Class is seen with his head buried in his hands, but is soon harassed by aggressors until compliance. Harkness is escorted out of the containment chamber and into a nearby conference room, where he is interrogated (Audio transcript of active microphone can be found below). D-3244 stops convulsing and is considered lost.  
&gt; 
&gt; 09:05 - D-6821, D-0312 and D-7110 all lose consciousness. Dr. █████ is still aware but bleeding heavily. D-6311 is pale, with deep circles under her eyes.
&gt; 
&gt; 09:13 - Members seemingly run out of flasks. D-6311 sways and crumples. Foundation Security personnel are seen firing into room, killing two Insurgency members and injuring Jr. Researcher Vasilev. Remaining members shoot and kill Vasilev and proceed to attempt escape. Foundation assault proves capable of deterring assailants from re-obtaining SCP-3545, who return fire until one member primes a plastic explosive on the far wall. 
&gt; 
&gt; 09:22 - Insurgency associates detonate explosive and exit facility. Foundation pursuit ensues.
&gt; 
&gt; 09:30 - Remaining members escape. Damage is assessed. Dr. █████ is recovered and placed in medical bay with severe neurological complications and ruptured eardrums. Harkness is found unconscious in conference room with a non-lethal bullet wound in his shoulder.

&gt; //The following is an audio transcript of the interrogation of Sr. Researcher James A. Harkness and an unknown Chaos Insurgency member, referred to as POI-3545-06.//
&gt; 
&gt; [Sounds of struggle and gunfire can be heard]
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3545-06:** So here&#39;s how this is going to go down. I&#39;m going to ask you some questions. If you don&#39;t answer, you die. I see your clearance level. I know you know what I want.
&gt; 
&gt; **Harkness:** You&#39;ll have to do better than that.
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3545-06:** [laughing] You&#39;re a piece of work.
&gt; 
&gt; [A loud thump, followed by a sharp groan]
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3545-06:** Let&#39;s start over. Mind if I smoke? Don&#39;t answer that.
&gt;  
&gt; [Some rustling, and the flick of a lighter]
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3545-06:** My friends and I came for something. I know you know about it. You&#39;re gonna tell me where it is.
&gt; 
&gt; **Harkness:** You already got the glass, what more do you want?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3545-06:** I want to go //inside//.
&gt; 
&gt; **Harkness:** I&#39;m sorry? You mean the ZKs? You don&#39;t need me for that. You have the numbers!
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3545-06:** How can you be so smart yet so dense?
&gt; 
&gt; [Sr. Researcher Harkness howls in pain. Later medical intake reveals several cigarette burns on his upper arms and neck]
&gt; 
&gt; **Harkness:** Shit fuck, what do you want?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3545-06:** I told you, I want to go [[[scp-2719|INSIDE]]].
&gt; 
&gt; [Silence is recorded for several seconds]
&gt; 
&gt; **Harkness:** You mean-
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3545-06:** //Yes//, I mean. Ever since ████ absconded with that [[[djkaktus-s-proposal|weapon]]], we have been biding our time. We just needed two more pieces to complete the puzzle, and one of them is right next door. The other you are going to lead me to.
&gt; 
&gt; **Harkness:** You&#39;re crazy if you think I&#39;ll take you there. Even if I did know. Which I don&#39;t. Try an O5.
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3545-06:** [laughter] You really are a card. Don&#39;t play with me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Harkness:** I&#39;m not. I don&#39;t know, and I&#39;ve never met anyone outside of Overwatch that does. Plus, you think that O5-4 is really going to let you use it?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3545-06:** You just leave four to us. All I need is a site number.
&gt; 
&gt; **Harkness:** Then you&#39;re shit out of luck.
&gt; 
&gt; [Rapid gunfire is heard. Several screams follow.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Harkness:** Sounds like you&#39;re running out of time.
&gt; 
&gt; [Another smack, another groan]
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3545-06:** It doesn&#39;t matter. Even if I kill you now, we will find someone who cracks first. It&#39;s only a matter of time. 
&gt; 
&gt; [POI-3545-06 is heard cocking his sidearm.]
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3545-06:** Let&#39;s see if you&#39;re the same smart-ass you are now without your lower jaw. Or maybe I blow a hole through your soft bits and let you bleed out-
&gt; 
&gt; [A handheld radio on POI-3545-06&#39;s person speaks. The identity of the individual is not known.]
&gt; 
&gt; **??????:** Helleny and Graham are down. The rest are evac, meet [indecipherable] klicks south, your ride will be waiting for you.
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3545-06:** Copy that. Well, Harky, I guess this is goodbye.
&gt; 
&gt; [Gunshot, and a scream. Audio records steps and distant gunshots. Explosion is heard approximately one minute later. Audio ends. Sr. Researcher Harkness is found by security personnel a short time later, unconscious and possessing a life-threatening but ultimately nonfatal bullet wound to the abdomen. On-scene emergency medical intervention is provided and patient is moved to a temporary medical bay for stabilization. Outlook positive.]

&gt; {{And so there lies the holes, ripping the fabric of all. The puncture wounds of spacetime, the errors, the gaps in the code. Whatever you name it, those places you&#39;ll never go are only but one thing: a true vacuum. Free from reality, from anything that could ever be.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Still, those who plan to pass behind the curtain and glimpse the true lack-of-being of a ZK-Class Scenario will find that it is not like one would expect. We all thought it was emptiness, void.  A place where nothing could stand because nothing is. The truth, however, is much more disturbing.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{It revealed itself to us just after we found how to traverse them. Hundreds of tests with that goblet. So many wasted minds. We wanted to take some measurements, see just how far reality was bending in this thing. Our counters measured the Hume field and found it astronomically low, even more so than some of the more [[[scp-3001|notable exceptions]]].}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{When we sent them in there, it was the same. But the second the world started to unravel, our sensors went haywire. It spiked unlike anything I have ever seen.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{The truth, as it turns out, is that it is not just an empty world. It&#39;s a blank canvas. A fresh start for the universe. All that system needs is to have something introduced into it. Not just anything, but a mind. A mind that creates its own reality.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Like the ancient texts, the Upanishads, say, &#39;We are like the dreamer, who dreams, and lives inside the dream.&#39;}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{And yet, that isn&#39;t even the worst part.}}

**Item#:** SCP-3545

**Object Class:** Euclid/Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Testing with SCP-3545 is currently suspended indefinitely. Individuals who utilize or have utilized SCP-3545 are to be supplied amnestics and monitored. Existing instances of SCP-3545-1 are to be cordoned off permanently using standard protocol most suited for the location. As of this moment, there are over 1,094 sites of interest that contain SCP-3545-1 instances. The location of SCP-3545 is currently known only to the O5 council.

**Description:** SCP-3545 is the designation for an antique crystal drinking glass of unknown origin. The glass bears no identifying marks or artist etchings and is made of non-anomalous material.

When an individual or individuals maintain eye contact with SCP-3545 and concentrate on the object, it will begin to fill with a black liquid of unknown composition. During this process, the liquid is unable to be accessed. Individuals filling item are subject to detrimental neurodegenerative illness, the strength of which is compounded the longer individuals interact with the item.

After several minutes of sustained concentration, SCP-3545 will fill completely and its contents can be accessed via ingestion and a few rare esoteric items, including {{[DATA PURGED PER O5 REQUEST]}}.

Upon ingestion, subjects will become instantaneously aware of two four-vector coordinates in spacetime. These coordinates refer to the location and initial time of the manifestation of a ZK-Class Reality Failure Scenario, referred to as SCP-3545-1.

After the initial manifestation time, instances will disappear from our reality, only to resurface every ██ days during the same time. It has been determined that use of SCP-3545 causes these manifestations, and does not simply indicate their location.

During the SCP-3545-1 instance, any individual who passes through the boundaries and exits the other side will experience the ZK-Class Scenario as a manifestation of their own subconscious. In this right, individuals inside SCP-3545-1 become temporary high-level reality benders, but have little control over how the Event develops. The experience is described as &#34;dream-like&#34; and may or may not involve memories of those affected. Unlike previously hypothesized, the occurrence is not hallucinogenic by nature, but a corporeal, alternate form of reality. Electroencephalography tests taken on affected individuals reveal absolutely no change from baseline brainwaves, aside from natural reactions to what they experience.

Containment and correction of SCP-3545-1 instances is considered a top priority. Experimental reality anchors/stabilizers are currently in development for use of correcting abnormal Hume fields in SCP-3545-1.

&gt; {{Good luck with that. I&#39;ve seen the tech, it&#39;s good stuff. If it were anything else, I would have higher hopes. It won&#39;t work though. Try as you may, the holes are here, perforating our existence.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Only the dreamer has control over the dream. Even then, they&#39;d have to be lucid.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{It does make you wonder though, doesn&#39;t it? About us, and the rest of this god-forsaken universe.}}
&gt;       
&gt; {{We are like the dreamer. And one day, our Dreamer will wake. They will wake and our world will melt away. Only this time, none of us will be on the outside. There will be no curtain to pull back. No canvas to paint.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{It will be only the Dreamer and his world. Not ours.}}
