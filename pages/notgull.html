[[include component:image-block name=seagull.jpg|caption=This is not a picture of Researcher Calvin.]]

Researcher Calvin was originally hired after winning a pie-eating contest at a Foundation front company. Due to a loophole in the Foundation hiring contract originally meant to dissuade unionization, he was hired as research staff at Site-54, despite not having the appropriate qualifications for research or even a college diploma. Researcher Calvin has not been fired yet, as amending the paperwork necessary to disqualify him from employment would trigger the anomalous effects of several anomalies, some of which were created by Researcher Calvin himself.

Researcher Calvin is best known for his ability to turn minor problems into major, site-wide catastrophes. Examples of this strange ability include:

* The Site-54 cafeteria dishwasher had broken and was no longer cleaning dishes. Rather than waiting for the appropriate repair staff and potentially sacrificing a meal, Rsr. Calvin attempted to fix the dishwasher himself. The resulting flooding led to a containment breach of dozens of on-site anomalies, including several that made all edible material on-site no longer fit for human consumption.
* Rsr. Calvin attempted to install Linux on his Foundation-provided laptop. The resulting computer virus led to a complete black-out of Site-54 for several days.
* Rsr. Calvin attempted to correct the grammar of the documentation belonging to a small, Safe-class anomaly. Due to numerous typos and a previously unknown reality-bending effect of that anomaly, it suddenly became a Keter-class entity.

It is recommended that Rsr. Calvin be limited exclusively to interviewing sentient anomalies, as the lack of social skills observed in other researchers often leads to negative results. 

[[[https://notgull.github.io/|Rsr. Calvin has a blog]]]. Even though most material posted to it is of negative value, it should be monitored in the event that Rsr. Calvin uses it to accidentally or on purpose leak classified Foundation documents.

**ADDENDUM:** SCP Files

The following is a list of SCP files that Rsr. Calvin has been involved in. reports in the process of writing their own.

This was my first SCP that stayed on the mainsite. I had an SCP before this (in the same slot) about how there was a civilization of people trapped within the Saturn Hexagon by a witch or something, but it was deleted. I also had numerous other SCP ideas and drafts that were crushed by my newfound knowledge about which concepts worked. Can we get an F in chat?

Originally, it followed a very cliche structure: after it learned about electronics, it became evil and jaded. Thankfully, [[*user Sirens]] convinced me it was a bad idea. The naive personality came later, and eventually became the whole thing. There also used to be some weird connection to [[[SCP-094]]] that no longer exists.

This one was plateaued at +20 for a while before I wrote its tales. I do want to go back and fix some of the dialogue on this eventually. However, part of me wants to keep it the way it is, as a &#34;museum piece&#34; or sorts.

In my head, SCP-2785-1 is some powerful ancient artifact that the dude accidentally trapped himself inside of. But that was so long ago that I don&#39;t remember what I had in mind originally. You decide what it is.

Between 2785 and this one was a very, very bad SCP about an invisible demon that ate people&#39;s brains. After that one got deleted, I actually straight-up left the site for a while. Fortunately, [[*user shaggydredlocks]] convinced me to come back by offering to co-author a rewrite on that SCP. That one&#39;s still in the abyss (and it probably will be forever, considering shaggy&#39;s recent departure from the site).

This SCP began when I saw that you could use HTML in SCPs from [[[SCP-3125]]]. There were a lot of things I did wrong on this one. The format screw was actually written before the actual article. Although the phenomenon was grounded in real science, it goes so far into psuedoscience at some points that it seems like fantasy. The dialogue is wooden and the format screw is definitely done better in [[[SCP-2317]]], with less annoying stuff. It really puzzles me how this one hasn&#39;t been deleted yet.

Like 2785, this is on my &#34;go back and rewrite&#34; list. But considering how long it is, that would be quite a bit of work for something that&#39;s probably flawed on the conceptual level.

I think SCP-3095 represents one of my greatest idiosyncrasies when it comes to SCP writing. I wrote 3747 over the better portion of three months, and it&#39;s one of the worst ones I&#39;ve ever written. Meanwhile, I spent a week on this SCP, and it&#39;s my highest rated as of the time of writing. I also consider it to be one of the first that I really did a good job on.

The idea actually predates SCP-2785; I found an old piece of notebook paper with an early version of this one on it. The format screw came to me while I was brainstorming, although in the end it was probably unnecessary.

To be honest, the reason why it is rated so high is because of its tales in Team Bird. I do consider it a good representation of my work, however. And no, not just because of my name.

This one was originally going to be a multi-article epic, with exploration logs and interviews and teleporters and the like. However, I eventually wrote the first article, which was short and just had an interview, and I said &#34;well, this is good.&#34;

In my opinion, this is the best SCP I have written. It&#39;s short, it&#39;s effective, it goes in, does what it needs to, then gets out, and leaves holes for the reader to fill their imagination with without making the reader hunger for more too much.

My first entry into the Doomsday Contest for Team Bird. To be honest, I don&#39;t really like this one. It&#39;s a flimsy idea designed pretty much exclusively to do what Join the Flock already does better. It went through quite a few iterations and the final product kind of mutated quite a bit from its original form.

However, it does what it does well, and I think it&#39;s kind of a quarterstone of Team Bird. So up it stays.

The better Team Bird skip, IMO. Written entirely on my cell phone while taking vacation on a lake. The funny thing is that it isn&#39;t really a Team Bird SCP up until the last few paragraphs. Figures, right?

My 4kon entry, and also one of my better SCPs. I went through about 3 history-related themes before I arrived at what I have here. This was actually supposed to be a piece starting a whole series about the Multiversal Foundation Alliance and building off of that. However, I never really committed to the idea, so I think this will stay a solo piece.

The main problem with the SCP is that it explicitly requires the reader to deduce something in order for them to fully enjoy it. That means that you&#39;ll have a lot of people who don&#39;t even notice the actual ending. I figure it&#39;s a sacrifice that I&#39;m willing to make for providing a puzzle for the enlightened reader.

My first and highest rated rewrite began with a rather bad article by a user about a magic theater where odd creatures watched worlds like television shows. My SCP doesn&#39;t have much in common with that one, aside from being a theater that could be accessed from the internet.

It was originally a Wondertainment SCP; however, it was made better without that connection. Randall was originally just really angry that the Foundation drove away all of his customers; however, making him introspective instead really helped him strike a chord with the audience, I feel.

This one was my highest rated for a good period of time. [[*user MayD]] even told me it was in their top ten SCPs, which is awesome. I don&#39;t really plan on writing any more Happiness Factory SCPs; not out of any fatigue, just that every time I try I just run into similarities with Wondertainment.

After I wrote my first three successful SCPs, I wanted to write a tale about one of them. 3747 was right out. I originally began writing a tale about SCP-3095, but then I realized that SCP-2785 was probably more entertaining to write about.

This has probably had the most positive reception out of anything that I&#39;ve written. As of the time of writing, it has reached +100 without any downvotes. For a long while, it was even rated higher than the original 2785. I still don&#39;t know how I managed to hit all of the right notes for SCP-2785&#39;s personality with this. I really don&#39;t have much to say here, other than that I&#39;m proud of this tale.
