[[include component:image-block | name= grave.jpg| caption= SCP-7049 prior to the excavation conducted on 19/03/2012. | width=300px]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** Forward Containment Outpost 47 has been established around SCP-7049 for the purposes of containment and study. Exploration efforts into SCP-7049-1 are to be halted until further investigation into SCP-7049-1&#39;s spiritual significance is conducted.

**Description:** SCP-7049 is a small plot of land located approximately 30 kilometers east of Morlaix, France. A gravesite is located on the premises of SCP-7049. The only known entrance into SCP-7049-1 is located 2.6 meters beneath the surface of SCP-7049.

SCP-7049-1 is an anomalously large space. Estimates of the space&#39;s area have ranged from 100 km² to an infinite size. The entrance into SCP-7049-1 is a rectangular area of bright light that functions as a portal that causes any object that makes contact with said entrance to be translocated into SCP-7049-1. All objects that enter SCP-7049-1 in this way are translocated to be in a close proximity to a similar area of bright light located in a clearing within the anomaly, although this area is located on the surface level of SCP-7049-1. Objects that make contact with said area of bright light are translocated to be within a close proximity of SCP-7049.

Despite the subterranean location of the entrance into SCP-7049-1, the anomaly itself appears to be on the surface level. SCP-7049-1 is heavily forested[[footnote]]However, the health of the vegetation that inhabit SCP-7049-1 is generally poor.[[/footnote]], and it is perpetually under cloud and mist cover [[footnote]]Although, the thickness of this cover is not uniform in all areas of the anomaly.[[/footnote]] The only fauna that have ever been discovered in the anomaly are SCP-7049-2 instances.

SCP-7049-2 instances are entities that inhabit SCP-7049-1. Although they vary in appearance and capabilities, all instances are partially or entirely humanoid and capable of vocalization. SCP-7049-2 instances generally possess human-like facial features, although some have been recorded to have facial features more closely resembling various species of animals rather than humans. 

SCP-7049-2 instances do not interact with humans unless a human has made physical contact with them, at which point the instance will typically become hostile to all humans it encounters. No SCP-7049-2 instance has ever been recorded to have interacted in any way with another instance, even when they are within close proximity of one another[[footnote]]It has been theorized that SCP-7049-2 instances are unaware of other instances&#39; existences.[[/footnote]]. This lack of interaction is absolute, to the point that instances have been recorded phasing through one another.

**Exploration Video Log Transcript**

**Date:** 27/03/2012

**Exploration Team:** Mobile Task Force Kappa-13 (&#34;Popolo of Purgatorio&#34;)

**Subject:** SCP-7049-1

**Team Lead:** K13-Com

**Team Members:** K13-1, K13-2, K13-3, K13-4

//Foreword-Due to the lack of drone resources allocated to Sector-66[[footnote]]A Foundation administrative unit that encompasses northwestern France.[[/footnote]] at the time of exploration, it was determined that a human squad was the best suited for the expedition into SCP-7049-1. Video begins as MTF Kappa-13 are adjacent to SCP-7049, the interior of which had been excavated to the depth of 2.6 meters. All members of the squad are equipped with body-mounted and head-mounted cameras. All spoken words in this log are translated from French.//
-----

[BEGIN LOG]

**K13-Com:** Checking in, are we ready to go?

**Command:** We&#39;re finalizing expedition paperwork and ensuring our equipment is in working order, commander. Expect the countdown in thirty seconds or so.

**K13-Com:** Alright, sounds good. How are you holding up, guys?

//K13-3 closes his eyes. He takes hold of a small golden cross attached to a necklace. He begins to speak quietly, and no other member of the squad appears to notice him doing so.//

**K13-3:** Dear God, protect me in this journey, for it is all in Your hands. I pray that you deliver me through this, so I may continue-

//K13-3 continues to speak, although he does so too quietly to be understood.//

**K13-2:** Doing well, commander.

**K13-Com:** That&#39;s what we want to hear, Adrian. Arun?

**K13-1:** I&#39;m as well prepared as I&#39;ll ever be.

**K13-Com:** Good, good. Damien?

//K13-Com turns to face K13-4. K13-4 retrieves a pair of aviator sunglasses from a pocket attached to his combat vest. He places them on his face as to support them with his ears and noses.//

**K13-4:** Let&#39;s kick some ass.

//All members of the squad, excluding K13-3, lightly chuckle. K13-4 taps K13-3 on the shoulder, causing him to cease praying.//

**K13-4:** What&#39;s the matter, Jean? Didn&#39;t think it was funny?

**K13-3:** I&#39;m just a little busy, that&#39;s all.

**K13-4:** I hope you&#39;re getting the big guy to really pull one out for us when we&#39;re down there.

**K13-3:** Don&#39;t you worry, I&#39;m very sure he can handle it.

**Command:** We&#39;re ready to begin, Kappa-13. Countdown will begin now.

**K13-Com:** Alright, we hear you.

**Command:**15...14...13...12...11...10...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1...operation is clear to begin at your discretion, K13-Com.

**K13-Com:** No reason to delay, guys. Let&#39;s get going.

//All members of the squad approach SCP-7049. K13-2 and K13-3 enter the excavated center of the anomaly. K13-1 begins to move his body in quick, small motions.//

**K13-1:** Just got to get the jitters out, you know?

**K13-Com:** I can see why, you&#39;re as red as a tomato right now! Nervous? Can&#39;t you just pray to the Buddha for help?

**K13-1:** Well, I can&#39;t really pray to him, more like meditate to myself, and we don&#39;t exactly have time for 15 minutes of breathing exercises.

//K13-Com chuckles and motions K13-1 forward. K13-1 enters the excavated center of SCP-7049-1.//

**K13-4:** Cannonball!

//K13-4 jumps into the excavated center of SCP-7049-1. K13-Com follows him immediately afterwards. The squad regroups within the anomaly at the edge of a clearing.//

[[include component:image-block | name= forest1.jpg| caption= Photo taken by K13-2&#39;s head-mounted camera. | width=300px]]

**K13-4:** Doesn&#39;t exactly look underground, eh Adrian?

**K13-2:** Definitely not. What do you think, commander? Pocket dimension? Teleportation?

**K13-Com:** God knows. What matters is that we don&#39;t get ourselves killed before we find anything. How should we continue, command?

**Command:** We detect nothing of concern as of now. We advise you to continue forward in a straight line.

**K13-Com:** Copy that. Alright guys, let&#39;s get going.  

//The squad begin to move in a northerly direction in a single file line formation. K13-Com is at the front of the squad, and K13-3 is at the rear. All members of the squad remain silent for three minutes and four seconds.//

**K13-1:** Damn, it&#39;s cold like nothing else in here.

**K13-4:** That&#39;s some really deep insight there, Arun.

**K13-1:** (//Gesticulating in an offended manner//) Well, is it not?

**K13-2:** And quiet, too. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s been any wind, or even a sound off in the distance. No footsteps or crushed plants, either. Didn&#39;t they do some work before the mission and detect some stuff in here?

**Command:** Yes, our equipment detected what appears to be entities within SCP-7049-2. However, our findings were more consistent with carcasses than any living thing.

**K13-4:** Great, who wants to bet we&#39;ll be shooting zombies sometime today?

//No member of the squad speaks for eight seconds.//

**K13-3:** You know, Arun, you&#39;re right about the cold.

**K13-4:** Of course he&#39;s right, anyone could tell it&#39;s fucking cold.

**K13-3** No, no, not like that. Maybe it&#39;s more like...chilling, but on the inside.

**K13-4:** What?

**K13-3:** It&#39;s hard to describe. It&#39;s...like how, you know, if you put your hand under the bath faucet, and it&#39;s hot, but it&#39;s so hot it feels cold? But it&#39;s in my soul, or something like that.

**K13-4:** What the fuck are you talking about?

**K13-3:** I can explain it better, but you&#39;ll have to listen to more of my spiritual crap.

**K13-3:** Alright, hit me.

**K13-4:** Remember when Marie died in that car crash a year ago. You remember her, my good friend from when I was a kid?

**K13-4:** Yes, a little bit.

**K13-3:** Well, I remember that night, when I was going to bed. I went to pray, like I do every night. But this time, I was talking for maybe a half hour. It&#39;s just this...strange thing, you know? It&#39;s cold, and it&#39;s also warm. I felt totally abandoned, betrayed, like the God of the universe owes me an explanation. Yet, somehow, I never felt Him closer. I felt the furthest from Him I&#39;ve ever felt, but also, somehow, the closest.

**K13-4:** Oh, well, I&#39;m...sorry for your loss.

**K13-3:** Don&#39;t be. You didn&#39;t do anything, and you couldn&#39;t have changed what happened. I feel pretty bad, actually, using that story to show how I feel now, when I&#39;m just walking in a forest.

//No member of the squad speaks for 4.5 seconds.//

**K13-1:** If it helps, I know that feeling. Maybe it&#39;s not quite that way now, but when I sit down to meditate, it&#39;s a very personal thing, you know? Alone with no one by yourself for 20 minutes. Some people can&#39;t do it. Every so often, I can&#39;t do it. Sometimes, it really digs down deep into me, it makes me really take a look at myself. That time is when I think about what&#39;s really wrong with me, what&#39;s holding me back, all my problems, and then I feel that cold but hot thing inside. Maybe I don&#39;t feel God, but I feel so...enveloped, by myself, but I also feel so alone. Exposed, I guess?

**K13-4:** Well, I don&#39;t know about either of you, but I just feel freaked out by this place. Not really scared, just kinda spooked, yeah?

//No member of the squad speaks for 9.2 seconds.//

**K13-Com:** Now that all our resident philosophers are finished, can we get back to making sure we don&#39;t get mauled by whatever lives in this place?

//All members of the squad laugh.//

**K13-1:** Maybe they can add &#34;SCP-7049-1 makes everyone inside it feel cold and alone.&#34; to the file?

**K13-Com:** Maybe. Maybe it also makes people inside it less nervous. You&#39;re not red at all anymore.

**K13-1:** Well, you&#39;re not exactly looking colorful yourself. You&#39;re so pale, you look like you don&#39;t even know what the sun is!

//K13-Com turns his head to look back at the squad, and then turns again to look forward.//

**K13-Com:** Well, I&#39;ve been outside plenty this week, thank you very much. You all look...whiter.

**K13-2:** I know we&#39;ve been making jokes here, but that&#39;s interesting. Maybe that&#39;s an effect of the anomaly here?

**Command:** It is noted, K13-2. Please continue moving forward.

[[include component:image-block | name= forest3.jpg| caption= Photo taken by K13-Com&#39;s head-mounted camera. | width=300px]]

//The squad continues to move further north for six minutes and 17 seconds. No notable events occur. The squad then ceases movement as they approach the edge of a forested area. The flora of this area is in considerably better health than seen in most other areas of SCP-7049-1.//

**K13-Com:** Command, we&#39;re entering an area that seems like it could be a lot more dangerous than the semi-open fields we were just in. How should we continue?

**Command:** Continue forward, K13-Com, but stay vigilant. 

//K13-Com turns to the rest of the squad.//

**K13-Com:** Alright boys, we&#39;re going in. Stay sharp. I&#39;ll bet the things that live in this place are around here, this is the only place we&#39;ve seen where there are good plants.

**K13-2:** I&#39;m ready to go, captain.

**K13-1:** Let&#39;s get this done.

//The squad enter the forested area in a single-file line formation similar to the one they had formed previously. They begin to move in a northerly direction into the forested area. No member of the squad speaks of anything notable for the next 12 minutes and 41 seconds. K13-Com then raises his arm, his hand formed into a fist, causing the squad to cease movement.// 

**K13-Com:** Shut up. (//Pauses//)) Do you guys hear anything?

**K13-3:** No.

**K13-2:** No, commander.

//Cries and footsteps are barely audible in the footage at this point. These sounds become increasingly louder, and the squad is unable to locate the source of the sounds due to the thick vegetation and mist cover of the surrounding area. An SCP-7049-2 instance then is seen running at what appears to be a sprinting pace. The instance resembles a human female, although its skin is an unnatural shade of red. The instance is then heard to vocalize the words// &#34;Hello? Can anyone hear me? Someone?&#34; //and// &#34;Three days? Yes, three days!&#34; //in a panicked tone and loud voice. The instance then disappears further into the forest and away from view. K13-4 then turns his head in several directions, presumably to survey his surroundings.//

**K13-4:** Now what the fuck was that?

**K13-1:** Nothing good, that&#39;s for God damned sure!

**K13-4:** You think? She was red as hell!

**K13-1:** That&#39;s what you&#39;re focusing on?

**K13-Com:** Hush! We all saw the same thing! We don&#39;t want to yell and attract any-

**K13-3:** Gah!

//K13-3 begins to support his head with his arms. The cross attached to his necklace appears to begin to incandescently glow, although sensors attached to his combat vest show that there has been no change in the object&#39;s temperature. The rest of the squad turns to look at him.//

**K13-2:** Are you okay, Jean?

//K13-4 places his hand on K13-3&#39;s forehead.//

**K13-4:** Shit. Guys, he&#39;s burning up. He&#39;s getting red, too.

**K13-2:** You&#39;re looking very pale yourself.

//K13-1 then rubs his eyes and holds his head in his hand.//

**K13-1:** Shoot, dude, I&#39;m not feeling great either.

//K13-3 raises gestures with his arm, causing the rest of the squad to cease speaking. K13-3 then raises his head.//

**K13-3** I&#39;m...I&#39;m fine. Something&#39;s not right about this place. 

**Command:** You seem medically healthy, K13-3. Your vitals are good, although we have observed a spike in your temperature that is quickly returning to normal levels.

**K13-4:** Fuck, this place is creepy. Jean, is this some religious thing again? Is this more of that feeling you got after Marie&#39;s crash?

**K13-3:** Marie?

**K13-4:** Yeah, Marie. Your childhood friend. The girl we were talking about earlier?

**K13-3:** Marie, Marie, Marie...oh, yeah, her, I remember her. I remember when we...shoot, I can&#39;t remember anything about her. I can remember everything about you guys, but her, her mom, her brother...I&#39;ve just got nothing.

//No member of the squad speaks for 5.1 seconds. K13-2 then notices K13-3&#39;s necklace, and points to the cross attached to it.//

**K13-2:** We need to get that off, it&#39;s going to burn you.

//K13-3 turns to face K13-2. K13-3 appears to have been offended at K13-2&#39;s concern.//

**K13-3:** No! It&#39;s warm!

**K13-2:** I&#39;m sorry, I know it&#39;s cold.

**K13-3:** No, no, not like that! I feel like shit because I feel so fucking cold inside! It&#39;s in the soul, Adrian! I&#39;m freezing inside, except where the necklace is, right here.

//K13-3 repeatedly strikes the center of his chest.//

**K13-1:** Shit, maybe that&#39;s my problem too. I guess I feel...cold, alone, but on the inside, if that makes sense. It&#39;s like my hardest mediations, but it just doesn&#39;t quit. Deep breaths help a bit, but-

**K13-Com:** Alright, alright, enough! Just tell me, can you keep going?

**K13-3:** I think so.

**K13-1:** Yeah.

**K13-Com:** Alright, let&#39;s go, we don&#39;t have all day.

//The squad continue to move to the north in an unorganized formation. The squad has to slow their rate of movement in order to allow K13-3 and K13-1 to not fall behind the group, as both seem to be suffering from an undetectable health issue. No member of the squad speaks for eight minutes and 1 seconds, and nothing notable occurs in this time.//

//The squad then discovers an SCP-7049-2 instance. It resembles a human woman. It is in a sitting position on the ground. It has long black hair, white skin, and is covered in several disconnected ragged pieces of cloth. The instance is covering its eyes with its arms, although crying is audible.//

**K13-Com:** Command, we have sight of a stationary SCP-7049-2. How should we proceed.

//Personnel stationed in expedition command deliberate for 36.1 seconds.//

**Command:** We advise that you should attempt to interact with it, K13-Com. However, we permit you to terminate the instance if it poses a threat to any member of the squad.

**K13-Com:** Ah, shit, I guess I have to deal with this, huh? Alright guys, be ready to light it up if it gets any ideas.

//K13-Com draws his sidearm, while the rest of the squad draw their rifles. All train their weapons at the SCP-7049-2 instance. K13-Com slowly approaches the instance, and ceases movement when he is directly behind it.//

**K13-Com:** Hello, ma&#39;am, are you alright?

//K13-Com places his hand on the SCP-7049-2 instance&#39;s shoulder. It turns to look at him. The instance has several small puncture wounds on its face, and it is grinding it&#39;s teeth together. The instance then speaks in a whisper.//

**SCP-7049-2:** Hello?

**K13-Com:** Yes, hello.

**SCP-7049-2:** Hello, is someone there?

**K13-Com:** Yes, I&#39;m here.

//The SCP-7049-2 instance then begins to vocalize screams, and it begins to speak in a loud voice and panicked tone. It begins to turn its head in several directions.//

**SCP-7049-2:** Hello!

**K13-Com:** Ah, shit...

//The SCP-7049-2 instance rises from its sitting position and lunges towards K13-Com, causing both of them to collapse to the ground. The instance begins to assault K13-Com. It is heard to scream the words// &#34;Hello! Anyone?&#34; //and// &#34;17 years!&#34; //repeatedly. Although it appears that physical damage should&#39;ve been inflicted on K13-Com with the instance&#39;s hands and teeth, no injuries are visible. However, K13-Com&#39;s skin tone becomes increasingly whiter when the SCP-7049-2 instance strikes or bites him.//

//After 7.8 seconds, K13-Com strikes the SCP-7049-2 instance with his hand formed into a fist, causing the instance to become unbalanced and fall to the ground adjacent to K13-Com. K13-Com then rises from the ground and runs towards the rest of the squad.//

**K13-Com:** Shoot it, shoot it!

//All members of the squad, excluding K13-Com, open fire on the SCP-7049-2 instance. The bullets phase through the entity, and it rises from the ground and approaches the squad in a run. K13-Com retreats behind the squad and begins to inspect his body. The SCP-7049-2 is unhindered by the squad&#39;s gunfire, and although it appears that it has focused its attention on K13-Com, the instance strikes K13-3 with its body as it runs, causing both to fall to the ground. The instance then quickly crawls as to place itself directly on top of K13-3. The instance is heard to scream the words// &#34;Where is everyone? Where am I?&#34; //K13-3 takes hold of the cross attached to his necklace, closes his eyes, and begins to speak quickly.//

**K13-3:** Heavenly Father, please save me this day. I pray that you may deliver me from evil, for I know-

//The SCP-7049-2 instance attempts to strike K13-3 with its arm, however, it makes contact with K13-3&#39;s cross. The instance cries out, and it recoils. The instance retreats five meters. The instance&#39;s arm is branded with a cross-shaped symbol, and it appears that it is suffering from a burn wound directly related to said branding.//

//K13-3 rises from the ground and begins to run in a southerly direction. The rest of the squad follows him. Although it is not visible in the footage, the SCP-7049-2 instance appears to be running towards the squad, as evidenced by the cries and screams heard in the background of every squad member&#39;s audio feed.//

//The squad runs for a minute and 13 seconds, at which point they enter a clearing. There are several SCP-7049-2 instances in the area, all a large distance from each other and in sitting positions. None of them are moving or making any form of sound. These instances resemble humans to a lesser degree than previous seen instances, as all of them appear to have taken on avian, piscine, ranine, reptilian, and/or simian features. All instances visible have wounds inflicted on their backs that are reminiscent of tally marks. The number of wounds inflicted on individual instances ranges from 137 to 4,183.//

[[include component:image-block | name= forest4.jpg| caption= Photo taken by K13-2&#39;s head-mounted camera. | width=300px]]

//A dilapidated building is located at the edge of the clearing. No SCP-7049-2 instances are in a close proximity to it. The squad runs towards the building, avoiding all SCP-7049-2 instances, presumably as to not make contact with them. All members of the squad successfully arrive at the building. K13-2 takes hold of the wooden board obstructing the entrance to the building. He allows all other members of the squad to enter the building, and enters the building, and obstructs the entrance into the building with the wooden board. K13-Com and K13-1 train their weapons at the door of the building.//

**Unknown Voice:** You should know by now that that doesn&#39;t do anything. Bullets don&#39;t have a soul. It&#39;s alright though, they don&#39;t come in here.

//All members of the squad turn to face an SCP-7049-2 instance located further within the building. The instance is located in a poorly illuminated area of the building.//

**K13-Com:** Who the hell are you?

//The instance steps forward, and is better illuminated due to this. It smiles. It resembles a human male dressed in worn, simple clothing, and it has a pair of tattered wing attached to its back. These wings are reminiscent to those possessed by animals that are members of the order Chiroptera[[footnote]]More commonly known as bats[[/footnote]].//

**Interview Log Transcript**

**Date:** 27/03/2012

**Interviewed:** SCP-7049-2

**Interviewer:** Assistant Researcher Charles Moulin (Dr. Moulin)

//Foreword-The following is an impromptu interview conducted 29 seconds after the end of Exploration Log.7049.1. The questions asked of SCP-7049-2 were entirely improvised. The interview was conducted via a remote connection to Site Command utilizing a microphone attached to K13-3&#39;s uniform. All words spoken in this log are translated from French.//

[BEGIN LOG]

**Dr. Moulin:** Hello, can you hear me?

**SCP-7049-2:** Yes, I can hear you well, sir. Your name?

**Dr. Moulin:** Charles, but for now please call me Dr. Moulin. And you?

**SCP-7049-2:** I&#39;ve been called many names by many peoples. Moloch, Iblis, Baal, more than I care to count. I would appreciate it if you call me, say…Morning Star, simply for flattery&#39;s sake.

**Dr. Moulin:** Alright, um, okay, Morning Star. You mentioned bullets not having souls earlier. What do you mean by that?

**SCP-7049-2:** Well, it&#39;s really quite simple, Dr. Moulin. You are human, yes? Well, being a human, you have a soul. Bullets, not being humans, do not have souls. I believe you understand now?

**Dr. Moulin:** Yes, I thought that was the case before I asked about it, but I more mean how you said that it &#34;doesn&#39;t do anything&#34; to shoot the entities that live in your world. What do you mean by that?

**SCP-7049-2:** Well, you can&#39;t shoot a soul like you can a body.

**Dr. Moulin:** Ah, I see...wait, hold on-

**SCP-7049-2:** Well, I see I have to explain this as well. I am always reminded by how stupid your kind are. What you&#39;ve seen today are souls. They might appear to have a body, but they are all spirit, I assure you. So, being souls, they can only feel the flesh if the flesh invites them to, like if one was to lay a hand on them. Any material from your world not tied to a soul, like a bullet, well, the spirits won’t even know it&#39;s there.

**Dr. Moulin:** That&#39;s even what the less human things outside are? Souls?

**SCP-7049-2:** Yes, though, they&#39;ve been here a bit longer than what chased you into my home. I have yet to hear an apology for barging in, by the way.

**K13-Com:** Oh, I&#39;m very sorry Morning Star, we were just-

//The SCP-7049-2 instance gestures with its hand for K13-Com to cease speaking, causing him to do so.//

**SCP-7049-2:** Don&#39;t worry about it, my friend. I enjoy the company. I haven&#39;t had someone to truly converse with since that day in the desert. Has it been 2000 years by now? Yes, I believe so. I&#39;ve had little to do, and the spirits outside have had even less. Really, they just weep and count the time. Have you seen the tally marks on my friends? I count the years they have sat outside my home.

**Dr. Moulin:** And how long have you been here?

//The SCP-7049-2 instance does not speak for 11.3 seconds. It then speaks in a whisper.//

**SCP-7049-2:** Since the third day or so.

**Dr. Moulin:** It&#39;s alright if you don&#39;t want to talk about this.

//The SCP-7049-2 instance returns to its typical speaking voice.//

**SCP-7049-2:** I would prefer to not.

**K13-4:** Wait a minute egghead, I just thought of a question. Why can you talk to us, but the things outside can&#39;t? Hell, I don&#39;t even think they knew we were there, even if one was on top of us and trying to bite our heads off.

//The SCP-7049-2 instance turns to address K13-4.//

**SCP-7049-2:** Well, Damien, I&#39;m a bit special, as I hope you&#39;ve guessed. I&#39;ve talked to you before. When you ran off after that woman at the club, forgetting Marlene at home? I whispered that idea to you. I laughed when she learned what happened that night.

**K13-4:** Wait, how do you know that? How do you know my name?

//The SCP-7049-2 instance laughs. It begins to point at every member of the squad with its finger-like appendage.//

**SCP-7049-2:** I know you all very well. Maybe not every hair on your head, but...I have what I need. I knew your name as soon as your mother decided what to call you, Dr. Moulin, I didn&#39;t need to ask. 

**Dr. Moulin:** What?

//The SCP-7049-2 instance&#39;s tone begins to become more stern, and it begins to speak at a quicker pace.//

**SCP-7049-2:** Yes, Dr. Moulin. I&#39;ve whispered in the ears of many. For you to order another drink, even if your wife is ready for divorce because of it. Your leaders imprison innocent men because they received a gift from their maker, and that idea is mine.

//K13-4 aggressively approaches the SCP-7049-2 instance, and ceases movement when he is directly in front of it.//

**K13-4:** Alright man, enough with the shit. Who are you and what is this place?

//The SCP-7049-2 instance smiles.//

**SCP-7049-2:** I could explain, but I think you will learn for yourself soon enough.

**K13-4:** What?

//K13-Com demanifests in the video feed of all other squad members. K13-Com&#39;s video feed shows all other squad members and the SCP-7049-2 instance demanifesting. The remaining squad members turn to face the space that K13-Com was once occupying. K13-Com begins to call out for the other squad members, although he can not be heard in the audio feed of all other squad members.//

**K13-1:** Whoa, shit!

//K13-2 begins to speak in an aggressive tone.//

**K13-2:** Where did you take the commander, huh, buddy?

**SCP-7049-2:** Just wait a moment, please, and you&#39;ll know. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve all noticed that you and your friends have become, well...very pale. This is not a place designed with living spirits in mind, to say the least. Your commander was attacked by one of the damned, and being a soul, it can only harm the soul. That only quickened the process.

**K13-4:** Wait, what process? What the fuck is going on?

**SCP-7049-2:** You&#39;ll find out right about-

//All members of the squad demanifest in K13-3&#39;s video feed. In the respective video feeds of all other squad members, excluding K13-Com, all other remaining squad members and the SCP-7049-2 instance demanifest. All members of the squad, excluding K13-3, call out for other squad members and begin to quickly search the area.//

*SCP-7049-2:** -Now.

//K13-3&#39;s video feed shows the SCP-7049-2 instance approaching K13-3, and ceasing movement when it is directly in front of him.//

K13-3: Where...where did they go? Where the hell did you take them?

**SCP-7049-2:** You&#39;re right, Jean, this place...something...well, something isn&#39;t right about it. It takes things from you. It drains you, you can see it in your skin. Even while you’ve been drained, you may remember something right now. But once you&#39;re taken in, everything is gone. All you have is yourself, not even the comfort of your memories. In a day, you&#39;ll be running through the woods calling out for anyone to find you. In a year, you&#39;ll sit down in tears. In a hundred years, you will not even move a muscle. You will be alone, and you shall weep and gnash your teeth.

**K13-3:** No...no, I just-

**SCP-7049-2:** And, once again, I&#39;ve been proven right again. Humans are fools. You people just sat here for ten minutes, listening to me go on and on while your souls were taken, and you did nothing! It was a ruse, you morons! A trick!

//The SCP-7049-2 instance takes hold of the cross attached to K13-3&#39;s necklace and forcibly removes it from K13-3&#39;s neck. The instance then takes hold of K13-3&#39;s uniform collar and begins to shake K13-3 violently to accentuate its speech. The instance also begins to speak in a loud voice and aggressive tone.//

**SCP-7049-2:** And yet, the world is like this? This is your savior? I can save you! I am one of God&#39;s greatest creations, and I can be your lord, you...you worthless race of dogs! He...He, well, He just can&#39;t understand me! You don&#39;t understand me! You let His pathetic son rule your life, but you scoff at me? Maybe you can hold onto your spirit here for just a bit longer because of this...delusion of a lord, but heaven will be mine, and you will worship at my feet. You hear me, you cockroach?

//The SCP-7049-2 instance demanifests in K13-3&#39;s video feed. Due to the loss of ability to communicate with the instance, the interview is prematurely concluded.//

**Exploration Video Log Transcript**

**Date:** 27/03/2012

**Exploration Team:** Mobile Task Force Kappa-13 (&#34;Popolo of Purgatorio&#34;)

**Subject:** SCP-7049-1

**Team Lead:** K13-Com

**Team Members:** K13-1, K13-2, K13-3, K13-4

//Foreword-The following is an immediate continuation of Interview.7049.1. All spoken words in this log are translated from French.//
-----

[BEGIN LOG]

//K13-Com briefly searches the building, presumably in an attempt to locate the other squad members. He then exits the building[[footnote]]The previously mentioned wooden board obstructing the building&#39;s exit is not visible in K13-Com&#39;s video feed, and this is true for all other squad members[[/footnote]].//

**K13-Com:** Hello! Is anybody there?

//K13-Com begins to retrace the route the squad followed during the expedition. He begins to yell for assistance. He also yells in attempts to locate the other squad members.//

//Due to a navigation error, K13-Com does not locate the exit of SCP-7049-1. K13-Com begins to move in an easterly direction, causing himself to move deeper into the forest. After 30 minutes and 13 seconds, he begins to run, although he does not do so consistently for the remainder of the footage. No notable events occur until his camera equipment depletes its battery reserves after 11 hours and 35 minutes, causing the cessation of the video feed.//

//K13-2 begins to yell for assistance, and he also yells in attempts to locate the other squad members. He attempts to retrace the route the squad had followed during the expedition. He makes a similar navigation error to K13-Com, causing him to move in an easterly direction deeper into the forest. K13-2 runs consistently for the remainder of the footage. After six hours and 19 minutes, K13-2&#39;s skin tone begins to become increasingly more red. His camera equipment depletes its battery reserves after five hours and ten minutes, causing the cessation of the video feed.//

//K13-1, K13-3, and K13-4 all begin to retrace the route followed by the squad during the expedition. They all begin to yell for assistance, and they also yell in attempts to locate other squad members. They all follow extremely similar routes, as they successfully retrace the route followed by the squad during the expedition, causing them to individually return to the exit of SCP-7049-1 at separate times.//

//In all video feeds, the exit of SCP-7049-1 is not visible. Attempts by K13-1 and K13-4 to make contact with the area previously occupied by the exit of SCP-7049-1 have no effect.//

//K13-4 begins to run at a sprinting pace in a southerly direction. He begins to yell for assistance from his family and friends, although he does not call for any person by name. After 11 hours and 36 minutes, K13-4&#39;s camera equipment depletes its battery reserves, causing the cessation of the video feed.//

//K13-1 assumes a sitting position on the ground. He closes his eyes and engages in breathing exercises. Due to these things, his lowered heart rate, and his Buddhist faith, it is presumed that K13-1 enters a meditative state. K13-1 does not vocalize or move in any manner during this period. After three hours and 54 minutes, K13-1 assumes a lying position on the ground, presumably in an attempt to sleep. After 18 minutes, K13-1 is successful in his attempt to sleep. After seven hours, K13-1&#39;s camera equipment depletes its battery reserves, causing the end of video feed.//

//K13-3 assumes a kneeling position on the ground. He bows his head and begins to mumble words, although due to his low volume of speaking, they are unintelligible. A loud voice is then heard in the audio feed. The source of this voice is unknown, and it appears that K13-3 is unaware of the source of this voice as well.// 

**Unknown Voice:** Do not weep, child, for I have not forgotten you. Your tears will be wiped from your eyes on the last day. 

//K13-3 cries out. The tone of his voice is joyful. K13-3 then begins to repeatedly lower himself to, and lift himself from, the ground, in a reverent manner. He also begins to speak in an unknown language. After eight minutes, K13-3 returns to his kneeling position and resumes mumbling unintelligible words. After 23 minutes, he ceases doing this, and rises from the ground. The remainder of the footage is of K13-3 silently exploring SCP-7049-1. He moves in a southerly direction. After 12 hours and 57 minutes, his video feed ceases[[footnote]]Unlike the other squad members, K13-3&#39;s camera equipment does not deplete its battery reserve, and the cessation of the video feed was caused by unknown means[[/footnote]].//

//In all squad member video feeds, there are no SCP-7049-2 instances or other members of the squad visible at any time.//

[END LOG]

//Note-All attempts to communicate with the members of the squad during and after the events of this log have been unsuccessful.//
