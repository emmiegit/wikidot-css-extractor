Here at the Kroenburg Institute for Paranormal Studies we strive to educate the masses on the hidden world of magic and wonders that we all truly live in. With such a vast topic base comes a vast list of available studies. We hope that whatever course you choose will inspire and change you.

++++ Reality Shifts and How To Do It: Professor Lee Usti

Reality bending is a skill known to a shockingly large amount of people in this world, maybe even you? This course will entail survival of reality shifts, recognizing when reality is no longer what it was, and possible ways to change it yourself.

++++ Thaumaturgy and You. Magic Made Fun: Instructor Carol

Magic has not died in our world. Carol will be your instructor and they will show you that the mystic arts are real, and not as scary as Hollywood and those pesky normalcy groups would have you believe! Year 4 Students partake in our yearly Winter Solstice Show!

++++ Technology, Machinery, AI, and the Coming Singularity: Instructor Ratio

Machines are capable of so much more than we know. Who better to show you the wonders of true artificial intelligence and life, then a proper robotic being. Ratio will show you the ins and outs of robotics beyond what the rest of the world understands, and advancements in technology that you can partake in.

++++ Religions and Superstitions: Instructors Francis and Ecclecious.

Gods, angels, demons, spirits, archons. The heavens are not empty, and the pantheons are many. Our two instructors are unbiased scholars on the many different religions practiced around the world, and across the universe. From the Nälka to the Church of the Second Hytoth, all will be taught. They&#39;ll even do their best to explain Fifthism!

++++ Wildlife Survival and Cryptozoology: Instructor Skeeter

Want to know how to track strange and mysterious wildlife? How about how to meet and live with the Yeren? Well Instructor Skeeter&#39;s class will be right up your alley! Prepare for a hands-on style of teaching and make sure you have a packed bag with you at all times.

++++ Media and Entertainment in the Anomalous World: Instructor JM Drew

Movies with memetic messages, music that plays it&#39;s own music video as you listen to it, comic books that move, stage plays with real magic, in the paranormal world media is elevated. Instructor Drew is an expert in this field, with over fifty years experience in it. Don&#39;t let his appearance fool you though, he loves nothing more then teaching what he does.

++++ Misconceptions in Demonology: Instructor Santana

We&#39;ve had our fair share of tartarean entities enroll in our humble institute with a desire to learn more of this world that is usually just outside their reach. We are blessed to have one such entity under our wing teaching you about the reality of demons and their existence. And no, this course will not cost you your soul.

++++ Paracrime and the History of Anomalous Black Market Groups: Instructor Inmate and Detective Hustle

No, this course will not teach you how to commit crimes using paranormal skills or objects, nor will it teach you how to establish your own paracrime syndicate. What it will teach you is how to identify such groups, and survive.

++++ Elevated Meals with Magical Ingrediets: Chef Reuben Macintosh

Grilled Kraken, golden goose eggs, truly impossible chocolate flan. When you have access to ingredients thought to only exist in fantasy novels, cooking elevates from science to true magic. Chef Macintosh will introduce you to mind blowing ingredients from Nexus points around the globe, and show you how to utilize them safely for mouth watering meals.

++++ The Rise and Fall of Anomalous Empires Through History: Instructor Ferloach

From the Daeva to long lost Adytum, The Islamic Republic of Eastern Samothrace and even Amoni-Ram the true history of civilization is drastically limited to the common man. Instructor Ferloach will go indepth on the true history of civilization. (NOTICE: Therapeutic counseling will be available for students who complete this course.)

++++ Physical Education: Coach Dylen Bruce

As much as we desire to expand your mind, your body will not be neglected. Coach Bruce will teach you workout techniques and stretches used by Nälka warriors, Clowns, Yeren guards, and more.

++++ Anart 101: Instructors Ausham and Parsure

Paint, sketch, etch, conduct, and do whatever is necessary to make beautiful works of art. Instructors Ausham and Parsure will show you safe anart techniques and teach you how to find a healthy creative balance between art and life.

++++ Hidden Holidays and Celebrations: Instructor Chanter

With such a vast array of cultures and religions holidays are bound to match. Celebrations for different historical events and legends have deep cultural impact and deserve to be shared. Come and expect each lesson to be a full sensory experience.

++++ Economics: Instructor Blake

++++ Warfare and Armaments: Instructor Cole

The Occult Wars, the original Nälka and Mechanite skirmish, photon canons, and android armies. War has never been simple, but even more than you think.

++++ Creative Writing and Narrativics: Author and Publisher

Pataphsyics, metaphysics, narrativics, stories upon stories. Author and Publisher will help you navigate these mind bending subjects, and by the end of the year you&#39;ll be able to delve into it and craft narrative layers of your own.
