Evening, everyone. Tough luck you all had your orientation at this hour, but it’s not like the average Foundation employee&#39;s sleeping schedule is any better. Just take your seats. Looks like you&#39;re all here— Ah, someone just came in late! Let me guess, you didn’t hear the knocking on your door. Just sit down, no need to embarrass yourself any further. Alright, looks like everyone’s here.

I’d like to welcome you all to the Foundation’s Research and Development Department. I’m Senior Researcher, Dr. Michael Meyer─ did I just hear a chuckle? And before anyone starts thinking they’re the funniest member of this department, just know that you’re not the only one who has come up with the Michael Myers joke. I’ve heard it enough.

Now, if you’ve been transferred to R&amp;D, it’s because of one of three reasons, and only these: one, you were caught doing unethical experimentation. Two, you had a grudge against a high-ranking member, and he or she sent you here. Three, you were so painfully average that they sent you here for replacement. That’s it. And if you think your case is special, trust me, it isn’t.

You may be wondering why you’re still wearing a lab coat instead of an orange uniform. My answer is that you’re still somewhat useful, yet not completely. You won&#39;t be under constant threats of anomalies like D-Class, you&#39;re just the middle ground between respected personnel and test subjects. That’s the whole point of R&amp;D.

Let&#39;s see now... you, the one with the buns. Do me a favor and check under your seat, please. You&#39;ll notice there&#39;s a control duct-taped, grab it and push the button. Oh, don&#39;t worry about the GPS location standing where you are, just do it. I&#39;ll just move a bit.

You hear the UAV, as well?! Whoa, careful with your eyes, everyone! It&#39;s great that they let us the conference room since there&#39;s a lot more space for the drone to fly. By the way, miss, grab the paper that&#39;s going to be delivered on the air! There&#39;s a question written on it.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
It had been a week since he was transferred from that humanoid site on the outskirts of Boulder to the most important site in the Foundation, located at Omaha – Site-19. That in itself wasn’t a bad deal, combined with the redaction of his involvement in the experiments he participated in. The bad thing was that he was transferred to a department even he didn’t know about: R&amp;D.

The first time he entered the sector, he didn’t receive any welcome – just a short orientation in the middle of the night, and tomorrow morning his work started. There were constant footsteps, the mumbling of researchers in front of an interactive whiteboard, and doors opening and closing every few minutes. But it was silent - like there wasn’t much work to do.

And there wasn’t, because he was playing with a colleague he met recently, Samuel, along with a buddy of his – yet he couldn’t remember his name.

//Something with L.// Meyer wondered. 

//L is for a lake, yet this guy is never quiet, nor can he sit for two seconds, he’s constantly flying – moving, that’s right, moving. He’s more like a river. There’s a river with L in Nova Scotia... the Larry River.// 

//Larry//, Meyer remembered. He never liked forgetting things, no matter how trivial they were – even if it wasn’t useful, he didn’t like that feeling. He threw the paper plane, it flew across some cubicles, passed above some heads, then turned around, heading back to Michael.

Before he could catch it, Larry busted it in grabbed it for him, then threw it again.

“Did I tell you about this mission we went on just a couple of days ago?” Larry asked as he turned around.

“Which of them all?” Michael asked.

“So, we were on our way to this hidden base in Pierre, Montana” Larry started – Meyer listening to the worst possible way to pronounce a French descending town. “Our mission was to look for any Chaos Insurgency technological complex and wipe them over.”

“But by the time we got there, we saw something odd: a squadron of flying men, using wings to fly all over the sky, with missiles attached to them. In self-defense, we fired against them – yet these bastards were extremely fast, it was like fighting an actual eagle.”

Larry kept rambling on and on about his adventure – Michael focused mostly on his paper plane flying back, right in time for Larry’s story to end.

“The last terrorist standing, or flying that is,” Larry winked. “Was taken down by me, he fell so high, that when he landed it sounded like this.”

He turned around, whistling, simulating how the Insurgency soldier sounded as he fell, and the moment Larry was about to mimic the explosion, the tip of Michael’s plane pinched Larry’s left eye.

Larry stiffed, covering his eye with his hand. Michael’s plane fell to the ground, in front of Larry’s feet. Samuel stood up and rushed to check on Larry – Michael did the same, yet he went to pick up his plane.

“Myers, what the hell are you doing?” Samuel demanded. “We need to check Larry’s eye, he might be blee─”

“He’s not,” Michael responded, showing the tip of the plane to Samuel. “It doesn’t have any blood spilled on top of it. It’s just a minor pain, it’ll go away.”

Larry slowly took off his hand and blinked several times.

“Yeah, I think I’m good.” Larry sobbed.

“Get a grip, Larry, you’re a pilot – you can kill a man at high speeds in the air but not stand the tip of a paper plane?” Michael said as he looked at Larry, returning his view to his paper plane.

“What the hell are you even looking at that thing for?” Larry asked. “It’s clean.”

“Larry,” Michael stated. “How would you feel about losing your job as a pilot?”

... And we thought: why not record the pilot&#39;s movements during combat, instead of controlling them from HQ? However, the project&#39;s development stopped. I&#39;ll talk about it later, but in the meantime: ma&#39;am, care to read the &#39;purpose&#39; section of the pamphlet.
 
‘Activities that are undertaken by the Foundation for the development, production, and innovation of new technologies beneficial for the containment and maintenance of the Veil’. 

Thank you very much. Let’s see now. You, Wade. Yes, you’re the only Wade I’m looking at now. Which department did you work with before your transfer? Ontokinetics - ouch, it must hurt to be demoted from such an important department to R&amp;D. Anywho, here&#39;s a question: what&#39;s the purpose of Ontokinetics?

‘The study of reality-bending anomalies.&#39; 

And before studying those anomalies, your department had to contain them. Specifically, with SRAs, am I correct? Damn, right I am. And who do you think fabricated those SRAs?

That’s right, R&amp;D did it. Has anyone here worked at Memetics and Infohazards? One, two, three. Alright, who do you think produced the countermemes and the highly controversial SCRAMBLE goggles? That’s right, R&amp;D did it. Now, at the time when the SCRAMBLE goggles were used in the field, R&amp;D wasn’t so proud of her work – but with time, you grow fond of something that reminds you of the old days. At least that’s what the senior officers tell me.

Nowadays, there isn’t much work. At best, you’ll all be working with minor technological machinery that won’t revolutionize any field, or writing research articles on new discoveries that won&#39;t be used any time soon. If it does, then just wait for the project to be transferred to its respective department – like with the SRAs. I must admit, there isn’t much future for any of you here. At best, you’ll be promoted to medium-rank. All high-ranking personnel, from head researchers to on-site directors, to the General Director – Karl Rosenbaum – are controlled by the O5 Council.

Scary, right? Oh, come on, don’t give me those looks. As much as I hate it myself, that’s the reality of the situation. Of our situation, that is.

//Clap.//

Yet that’s about it. Do any of you have a question so far? 

You, Baldo. How much will you get paid…? Look behind you, mister. Now, do you see a table full of donuts and warm coffee? Of course, you don&#39;t see it - it isn&#39;t even entirely full, only half of it is filled with water bottles and crackers. Now, take a look at my suit. Do you really think I can buy Armani or Gucci with this salary? Of course not. And that’ll be the same for you. The Foundation will pay you just enough for you, your family, and your loyalty to survive. Next. Woah, raise your hand when you want to participate, but I like your initiative. Can you ask for a transfer to another department? Sorry, pal. You were explicitly told that unless you need a good enough reason – and no, working at a dying department doesn’t count – you aren’t allowed to transfer. Anyone else?

&#39;Where’s Director Rosenbaum?&#39; 

Do you already want to kick his ass right before your first day? Professor Rosenbaum doesn’t leave his office, and nobody enters – not even his secretary. Did you notice the screens attached in some hallways? Whenever Director Rosenbaum transmits a message, an image of his face appears on-screen - it doesn&#39;t even move, it&#39;s just static. 

I don’t see any more hands raised, so this orientation is...

Who asked that? Whoever asked, don’t play the fool. Stand up and ask again. So, it was you. Did I hear that right?

&#39;Was it always like this?&#39; 

The golden question of every transfer, huh? Long story short, no. It wasn’t always like this. I didn’t live during the golden years if that’s what you mean. If you want to know about them, search for those who have greying hair. I was transferred when it was still thriving, yet I saw its first vestiges, and finally the cracks. 

&#39;Why was I transferred?&#39; 

I’ll let your mind wander on those three options I said at the beginning, but I can assure you that my hands aren’t clean – nobody’s hands in this room are.

Anyway, back to R&amp;D. The creation of R&amp;D was born after a [[[chaos-insurgency-hub|task force]]] defected from the Foundation - you&#39;ll know about them in the meantime, that&#39;s if you survive their raids. Ever since then, the Council has tried to find a way to use and weaponize anomalies to maintain normalcy. Of course, they knew the risks; they needed people, resources, and space – that’s when R&amp;D was born, along with its first site, Site-150.

The construction started in 1916, and it took an entire decade to complete. But once it did, everything changed. The project was so successful that more sites began to implement their own R&amp;D departments. Site-19 was one of the first ones.

Wherever R&amp;D went, it thrived. You could hear the footsteps of countless personnel, smell the air of novelty as if it was the plastic of a new book, touch every single invention that we came up with – that was our sweat, our blood, and our hard work. We were the foundation for technological advancement in the anomalous world. As former Director Foster said: &#34;it was progress.&#34;

However, our progress was halted. I don’t why or when, but I guess it started some years before I was transferred, before mid-2013. Supposedly, Dr. [[[walk-the-floor|Tabitha Foster]]] had problems with some members of the O5 Council – rumors say it was five and ten. Sanctions came in, projects were halted or entirely terminated, and the Ethics Committee began to finally do their work – by that meaning, they started to label anything as “unethical experimentation” and shutting projects down.

Remember the UAV from not too long ago? Well, we used the best pilots the Foundation had at its disposal, equipped them with an advanced flight suit that would analyze their movements, and then store it into an AI inside the UAV - we wanted to install the &#34;gut feeling&#34; of an actual, professional pilot into drones for air support, with the goal of replacing them for combat. However, that&#39;s where the Ethics Committee came in. 

Apparently, because of the high speeds and situations we were putting these pilots into, their bodies began to deteriorate, so they decided to put an end to the project - despite the pilots knowing the consequences that may occur and consenting to experimentation, the health insurance we provided after finishing the project, and the many reasons we gave that it could be beneficial in the long run, they did not care. This UAV is one of the prototypes, and it has its flaws. We mainly use them now for packaging and delivery inside the department.

Here&#39;s another example. Wade, when you arrived in America, you were transported from Site-45, right? Alright, now ask for your partner next to you to look under his seat. There&#39;s a controller that is for this projector. Now, Wade, move to the third slide. Know what that is? Yes, it&#39;s the map of the continental US, but there&#39;s a catch: Foundation High-Speed Rail for North America Proposal. The purpose of this proposal was to connect all the Foundation&#39;s sites with one high-speed rail that would transport both personnel and resources in a precise and efficient manner and further expand to encompass the entire North American continent, from the Rio Grande to Nova Scotia. Ambitious, am I right? 

Want to know why it was canceled?

**To:** michael.meyer@scip.net +23
**From:** j.p.kimball@scip.net
**Subject:** Review of the Foundation High-Speed Rail for North America Proposal
[[/div]]
------
Good afternoon, doctors and researchers, 

The proposal was received by the Board of Foundation Projects and Proposals (B.O.F.P.P) for the approval of the Foundation High-Speed Rail for North America Proposal. After initial analysis and discussion, and considering the magnitude of the project, the board decided to include members of the following departments: the Accounting Department, the Engineering and Technical Service Department, the Ethics Committee, and the Logistics Department.

After peer-review, a unanimous election was held between the twenty-six board members of the B.O.F.P.P. and a representative of each respective department, resulting in the following resolution: 10-6-14. Therefore, the proposal was **DENIED**.

The board members and representatives that chose to deny the project gave the following reasons:

1. The mere cost of a project of such magnitude and reach would be too expensive, even for the Foundation&#39;s budget.
2. Because the project is directly linked to sites and areas, some of them being in large urban areas, it would need to be constructed in public - affecting the safety of the Veil.
3. Even if the proposal was successfully created, it would be under constant attack by antagonistic GoIs (mainly the Chaos Insurgency and the Serpent&#39;s Hand).
4. Finally, currently the Foundation runs effectively with the use of trucks and airplanes, so there is no necessity to invest in a project of this size with no guarantee of its effectiveness.

The B.O.F.P.P. sends their regards for the resolution of the proposal, and they wish good luck for any future projects that the Research and Development Department may come across.

Sincerely,
//J.P. Kimball//
**High Secretary for the Board of Foundation Projects and Proposals**

The man, with his blank and tired eyes, finished reading the copy of the email above his desk. He looked up to the twenty-four employees that stood up in front of his desk, surrounding him - their eyes, unlike his, were full of light and tireless, waiting impatiently for his input.

He shoved the copy away from him, returning it to the group in front of him.

&#34;What is it that I should feel offended about?&#34; He asked.

One of the researchers frowned, stepping up from the rest of the group - Meyer was standing behind him with his fists clenched, to his right.

&#34;Did you even read the damn reasons for the project&#39;s denial?&#34; Samuel asked.

The man at the desk nodded.

&#34;It sounds reasonable enough, it&#39;s too excessive even for us.&#34;

&#34;Bullshit,&#34; Samuel answered, some of the group gazing at him, surprised. &#34;Our site literally has a fucking undercover story, as well as many other ones - we can&#39;t even make a fucking railway to connect all of them?&#34;

&#34;Samuel, you need to understand that we can&#39;t do much when a project is denied - the B.O.F.P.P. has their reasons.&#34;

&#34;And their reasons are stupid,&#34; Samuel stated and began counting with his fingers. &#34;First, we receive billions and billions of dollars from governments and private enterprises across the world - money isn&#39;t a problem. Second, we have a site in goddamn New York of all places - every day we risk the protection of the Veil. Third, our sites and areas have raids and containment breaches almost consistently. Fourth, this will help alleviate resources that could be used in other areas in the long run - need I remind you that the government built a transcontinental railroad in the //fucking// XIX century?&#34;

Samuel lashed out against the desk, looking straight into the man&#39;s eyes.

&#34;I&#39;m the Supervisory Researcher of this project, sir. And I say this is horseshit.&#34;

&#34;Woah, Sam,&#34; Michael grabbed Samuel&#39;s shoulder. &#34;Tone it down, will─&#34;

&#34;And I&#39;m your Head Researcher,&#34; The man said as he looked up, disappointingly, at Samuel in the eyes. &#34;And if the board says a project is denied, it&#39;s denied - there&#39;s nothing I can do about it, especially yourself.&#34;

&#34;You damn bastard,&#34; Samuel said as he was about to jump on him - Michael grabbed him by his arms, pulling him back.

As Michael pulled him out of the room, the rest of the team who were eager to talk to the Head Researcher piled up - but unlike Samuel, they didn&#39;t assault him. Finally, Michael drew Samuel out of the room, releasing him. Samuel turned around, facing Michael.

&#34;Why the hell did you do it?!&#34; Samuel shouted.

&#34;Listen to me here,&#34; Michael responded, grabbing him by the collar of his lab coat. &#34;You punch our Head Researcher, you&#39;re not the only one who gets sent to Keter Duty - the entire team! We can&#39;t invent anything if we&#39;re dead! Now, tell me, what the hell did you think you would win by punching him?!&#34;

&#34;That project was //my// ticket to leave this fucking department, that&#39;s why!&#34; Samuel barked. &#34;If I could just push him around a bit, maybe he might actually stand his ass up and demand for a second peer review - but no, there goes my lottery ticket, to the fucking //trash//!&#34;

Samuel shoved Michael away, walking down to one of the hallways before Michael missed him out of sight - Michael wouldn&#39;t see him for a while after that incident.
[[/div]]

------
Do you want to know the worst part? A year later, they built a section for the Northeastern sites - with the exact same model as Sam&#39;s blueprints.

Of course, people weren’t happy about all of this, but we could take the punches – we always did. However, two events marked the end of that era: the redirection of research and development technology to their respective departments – starting with Ontokinetics, Wade – and the isolation of new technologies during [[[resurrection|Project Resurrection]]]. 

I understand if you&#39;re confused and somewhat surprised, which leads me to believe that most of you don’t know anything about Alpha-9 or Project Resurrection. As a policy of so-called “transparency”, they’ve decided to open low-rank classified documents regarding Mobile Task Force [[[task-forces#alpha-9|Alpha-9]]], a task force with the mission to &#34;//train and utilize//&#34; humanoid SCPs. Do you want to know what it’s called? “Last Hope”. Cheesy, am I right?

You may ask what this has to do with R&amp;D. Because Alpha-9 had the goal to weaponize new anomalies, it also meant the creation of either classified, halted, or even incentivize the creation of new technology – and the one selected for this mission was Professor [[[kain-pathos-crow-s-author-page|Kain Pathos Crow]]]. Who’s he? A genius dog in a lab coat that can talk, in a nutshell. Professor Crow had a great influence on both R&amp;D and the Foundation - he was one of the most brilliant minds the department had. Since most projects would be headed by Crow, he couldn&#39;t do everything by himself - and that&#39;s when we came in. We believed R&amp;D would get a slice of the pie, that we would return to the technological progress we had before all the sanctions from the Council.

Our optimism increased when Dr. [[[drclef-member-page|Alto Clef]]], then director of R&amp;D at Site-17, was also appointed to work alongside Professor Crow. With these two individuals, along with Foster, not only could Alpha-9 weaponize the anomalies it had on the plan, but potentially create an overflow of technologies that could rival other technologically advanced Groups of Interest.

Some weeks passed, and those weeks turned into months and then months into a year. We spent an entire year waiting for work, for new projects. Foster knew something wasn’t adding up, so she contacted the Council. Until now, we didn’t know how the Foundation responded to her, nor gave any reason why we didn’t have a voice or participation in this new project – but whatever they told her was not pretty, nor what she was going to do about that.

It started with a strike - for a whole week, nobody at Site-150 worked. Nothing was designed, manufactured, or shipped. We got no response. Foster sent an email to all the sites that had an R&amp;D division, calling for a general strike on December 5, 2015. Several sites decided not to, but most did. It was a massive hit, that it was broadcast on Foundation radio, and media outlets - even appearing on the first page of the Foundation&#39;s journal. However, it didn&#39;t succeed. For one last time, Foster contacted the Council, demanding the lifting of sanctions and the participation of R&amp;D in Project Resurrection - and for one last time, she got no response.

Foster remained diplomatic, thinking that with enough pressure, she would set the Council and the Ethics Committee on the bargaining table. Then, Foster received an unpleasant gift on Christmas Eve.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
+ {{Incident Between R&amp;D and SD Ends In 13 Deaths And Many Injured}}
------
//December 26, 2016//

On Christmas Eve, R&amp;D&#39;s Assistant to Director Tabitha Foster, Eric Henderson, was killed - along with nine other R&amp;D employees and three security guards, while injured personnel on both sides reached thirty-four. Eric Henderson flew from Site-150 to Site-19 to meet with the Chairman of the Ethics Committee, Dr. Robert Feldon, who was at the site to celebrate Christmas Eve with other members of the Ethics Committee - Assistant Henderson was sent as a representative to Director Foster, hoping to open a dialogue with the Chairman to compromise between R&amp;D and the Ethics Committee, likely to put pressure on the Overseer Council.

However, Dr. Feldon left earlier than expected, along with the site&#39;s liaison Jeremy Schmidt, leaving the Ethics Committee&#39;s office complex closed and empty. According to witnesses, a pair of guards detained Assistant Henderson at the entrance of the office complex and questioned him. Some members of R&amp;D went on their way to support Henderson in his defense, while the guards tried to deescalate the situation. Eventually, gunfire was heard, and both sides began to attack and shoot at each other. The noise brought attention from members of both, escalating the situation - multiple R&amp;D personnel went after the guards unarmed, resulting in more casualties and injuries. R&amp;D employees that disarmed the guards took their weapons and shoot back, quickly falling down due to security reinforcements.

At the end of the massacre, R&amp;D members were detained while injured ones were transferred to emergencies alongside security guards. The incident resulted in thirteen deaths, nine of those from R&amp;D (including Eric Henderson) and four guards - thirty-four were injured on both sides. Witnesses vary, those saying that either R&amp;D members or those of the Security Department fired the first shot - the results are still on hold.

Director&#39;s Foster reaction was quick: she ordered the imprisonment and even termination of the guards involved in the incident, as well as compensation for the death of R&amp;D employees. Dr. Foster took advantage of the situation as well, once again demanding the lifting of sanctions against the department. The Overseer Council&#39;s response is still on hold.

To say that Foster was mad would be an understatement - she was enraged, using the incident as her way to rally more support for those members that still were skeptical of her scheming. And she would use it to take the next step.

Foster gathered the high-ranking officers of R&amp;D, those who were loyal to her. The idea was this: to overthrow the Overseer Council and replace the new one with members who were both of R&amp;D and those who wanted to utilize and weaponize SCPs for the betterment of humanity. All of them agreed with the plan, and they added as many people to the conspiracy as they could. I don’t have information on what the specific plan was, but I suppose it may have to do with a revolt along with a coup-d’état – I wouldn’t discard the possibility of other departments or Groups of Interest being involved, either. The conspiracy went from Foster to the youngest low-ranking member of R&amp;D.

&#39;Was I involved in the conspiracy?´

Michael had the night shift until Samuel pulled him out of his “work” – which consisted in seeing emails rejecting many of his proposals – and led him somewhere. Samuel and Michael crossed hallways, went through doors, and walked by several guards - then they reached a certain area, which Michael was convinced that his poor Junior Researcher clearance didn&#39;t allow him to go in.

“So, where are we going?” Michael demanded.

“Just a couple more minutes, and we&#39;ll be there,” Samuel answered, rushing through what looked like the exact same places as before, only rustier, older, lonelier – abandoned. No lights were on, and Michael doubted they worked.

However, he noticed a small beacon of light shining from a gap – most likely it was a door that led to the room Samuel was leading Michael to. As they drew closer, he noticed the figure of a man standing outside the door, guarding it. When Samuel and Michael arrived at the front, the man said:

“When the madness of the Veil engulfs us.”

“We bring reason to the anomalous.” Samuel completed. 

The man nodded, stepping aside. Samuel pushed the doors, the beacon of light becoming a full ray, almost blinding Michael. Michael blinked a few times, his eyes adjusting to the brightness of the room as he walked in. Then, he was halted, feeling a slam above his lungs. He saw Samuel&#39;s arm - he was about to complain, but when he saw what was in front of him, he understood why Samuel did what he did.

He stood in front of a railing and had he kept walking he mostly would’ve stomped into it and fallen to one of the thousands of members of the rally. Michael was standing on a balcony that extended in a form of a square, down him was the center of the building, the main hall: thousands of people in researchers’, engineers’ and doctor’s uniforms stood, stuck together, murmuring and whispering, waiting impatiently for someone to step on the stage.

The stage was decorated with two posters hanging on the wall, showing the emblems of R&amp;D: it was the Foundation’s emblem, the arrows pointing at the center with R&amp;D’s insignia – a lightbulb with a gear inside it, instead of the Tungsten filament, emitting brightness. The second one showed the slogan of the department in golden letters:

“When the madness of the Veil engulfs us, we bring reason to the anomalous.”

Michael looked at Samuel, his hands gripping the railing - Michael raised an eyebrow.

“What the hell is this place, Sam?” Michael demanded. “This is madne─”

Uproars and claps began to sound everywhere, echoing throughout the entire building, followed by the hushing from Samuel.

“It’s her!” Samuel pointed out.

Michael looked where Samuel was pointing, where a woman was slowly approaching the center of the stage. Her tall figure walked straight, each step calculated and with purpose - for Michael, the most interesting thing was her face: her chin was up, her sight looking forward, but Michael couldn&#39;t tell completely what her eyes looked like.

Tabitha Foster stood at the center, looking at the first row. She put her hands behind her back, looking at the second, then at the third, and so on. After finishing with the main hall, she looked up. When it was Michael&#39;s turn, he finally figured it out: Foster&#39;s eyes showed a penetrating gaze, a tenacious one - Michael&#39;s back shivered. When she finished looking everywhere, she smiled to herself and looked at the audience - likely appreciating that she had control of everyone&#39;s attention.

&#34;I want to thank each of you for coming down today,&#34; Director Foster started - her voice echoing, loudly and clearly, throughout each corner of the building. &#34;In these harsh times, we need to remain together.&#34;

&#34;We&#39;ve given a tough fight against those who have tried to halt our work, against those who cannot see the path to progress - those who believe that their petty, personal beliefs think that their actions justify the derailment of the Foundation&#39;s technological advancement. But I know, and all of you too, that this is not only ignorant but idiotic.&#34;

A bunch of uproars, claps, and yells came from Michael’s left.

&#34;For one hundred years, we&#39;ve been the backbone of the Foundation - their Atlas, weighing on our shoulders the destiny and survival of mankind. In all those years, we&#39;ve been the pioneers of technology to shield both ourselves and those outside the darkness we&#39;re fighting. We swore, just like those who are trying to stop us, to secure, to contain, and to protect mankind - like those thirteen researchers, who stood up for my assistant, Eric. And I&#39;d like to ask for a minute of silence for those that gave their lives for R&amp;D.&#34;

The entire room fell silent. Michael assumed that&#39;s how it sounded like when no one was on the lowest level of Site-19.

&#34;During these last months, we&#39;ve done the impossible to resist the sanctions, rejections, and interventions of the Overseer Council and the Ethics Committee - we&#39;ve given a good fight, too. We&#39;ve struck, protested, and stopped doing what we most care about - our work. From Site-150, to here, my audience of Site-19, we have punched a good blow to the Foundation. We never wanted to, but we were cornered, and we had to fight back.&#34;

“Yet, the O5s, like the cowards they are, have not answered to our demands, to our voices. Instead, they’ve hidden behind their masks of silence and anonymity. But we haven’t, right?!”

Like a wave, a massive “yes!” was yelled in unison – Michael noticed Samuel joining the crowd, yelling at the top of his lungs, consumed by rage.

&#34;Of course, we haven&#39;t! We&#39;ve shown our faces and broadcast them live to the entire Foundation. We are thousands, even millions of us that are proud members that we can say with our chests pumped up that we are Research and Development! That we won&#39;t be chained by the orders of Neanderthals of the future we&#39;re building - and most of all, that we are not going to take this anymore!&#34;

The people of the rally screamed and clapped in a furor, and Michael did the same – he didn’t want to be hit on the face if someone didn’t see him following the horde. Director Foster opened her arm to the right, with some people stepping onto the stage behind her.

&#34;But site one hundred and fifty cannot fight alone, it needs every single one of you to join our case.&#34; Dr. Tabitha Foster turned around and stepped back, letting the audience catch a glance at the people she wished to demonstrate. &#34;That&#39;s why I want to thank this site&#39;s director, Dr. Juliana Richardson, and assistant director, Professor Karl Rosenbaum, for giving full support to my... no, our cause. And I want you...&#34; 

Dr. Tabitha Foster took the center of the stage again. Michael didn&#39;t know her, but he knew that she felt like she had taken control again - not of the stage, not of the audience, but of something greater.

&#34;To follow my lead. Heed my words! The Overseer Council has become a threat, not only to this department but to the world. They are no longer capable of seeing past their own sight - they must come down, and we will do that job! Once we do, we&#39;ll take control of the Foundation, and reshape its philosophy and archaic methods - we&#39;ll utilize anomalies not only for the protection of the Veil but of humanity&#39;s progress! We will retake our former pride, and construct a new way forward. Members of the Research and Development, unite!&#34;

Chants, whistles, cries, claps, and yells resonated across the entire building. Everywhere Michael’s eyes looked, everybody had the same reaction – a fanatic enthusiasm, their eyes shining at the words they had just heard. And Michael did as well. But as he chanted, whistled, and clapped like everyone else, the back of his mind knew, and repeated to himself:

//This won’t work.//

... What I&#39;m mostly pissed about is that they never told me that I couldn&#39;t get a position beyond Senior Researcher after dismantling the conspiracy... so many ideas I had.

//Sigh.//

In the end, Foster&#39;s plan failed - it didn&#39;t even unfold. Not because of any counterintelligence or espionage, but because a certain someone revealed it to Internal Affairs - we still don&#39;t know who it was to this day. They quickly came in, and arrested each member one by one - they didn&#39;t even bother with interrogating or finding any evidence. By the end of the day, Site-150 was sieged. Some higher-ups fled to the Chaos Insurgency. Apparently, the Insurgency&#39;s ideology matched that of the conspirators. Others weren&#39;t so lucky, and nobody knows what became of ex-Director Foster - no doubt she&#39;s dead, though.

Former high-ranking and medium-ranks loyal to Foster were terminated, and replaced with those loyal to the Council, to ensure that any conspiracy of that size may never happen. Site-150 was completely revamped and became [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-120|Site-120]]] – it has the same purpose as ours, yet is now owned by the Department of Ontokinetics.

Foundation archivists and historians named this event the “Foster Conspiracy”. They’re not that creative with names, but it’s fitting. After that, R&amp;D personnel working at Site-150 were scattered across different Foundation sites, completely separated from each other, so that they could never organize on a large scale again – even some sites decided to completely shut down the department. Site-17’s R&amp;D became Training and Development, [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-43|Site-43]]]’s went from a department to a section and renamed to Research and Experimentation, and some other examples that I can’t recall now. Site-19 remains the last instance of Research and Development, completely forgotten compared to other departments and divisions – just like we are.

And here we are. How’s that for a bedtime story?

Oh, don’t give me those looks. You knew that there would be consequences if you crossed the line, yet you’ve all decided to do so. 

‘So, now what?’ 

Well, what can you do? Please, tell me. I’m so eager to listen to the next conspirator lunatic. If you want my advice; patience, that’s all I can say.

Well, I think that’s more than enough time for an orientation. The guards will take you back to your quarters, and tomorrow you’ll start your work. Night everyone─

&#39;When was I promoted?&#39; 

I was promoted to Senior Researcher just a couple of weeks after the conspiracy was dismantled. If nobody has any further questions, I have places to be.
