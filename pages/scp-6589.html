**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-6589 needs to be covered by opaque sheeting and guarded by at least 4 armed Foundation personnel to ensure no civilian can view it. The street SCP-6589 is located on is to be sectioned off so civilians are kept at a far enough distance from the possible effects of SCP-6589. Any activity near SCP-6589 by Foundation personnel is to be explained as construction to any civilians inquiring about the activities.--  From 17-09-2022 onward SCP-6589 is to be contained in a tarp in an inanimate anomaly containment chamber to ensure its effective containment. SCP-6589 is to remain covered up at all times to ensure effective containment. SCP-6589 and the letter found during recovery are not to be viewed by any personnel.

**Description:** SCP-6589 refers to a mural painted by Benjamin Caine, which had hazardous memetic properties of a memetic kill agent. The Foundation was notified while the mural was in the process of being painted because the livestream was flagged as hazardous by Foundation internet security when Benjamin Caine wrote the initials of GoI: “Are We Cool Yet?” next to the mural not long before finishing it. 

Upon completion, Benjamin Caine started showing an inability to breathe before vomiting mainly blood and falling forward showing no remaining signs of life. The same symptoms showed in all 29 civilian bystanders, the 4 remote response personnel, and the 3 response personnel deployed before the situation was fully understood.

After a memetic response A.I. was deployed on the livestream, a better course of action was decided. The building the mural was painted on was infiltrated by two agents. These agents were sent in under the guise of construction starting the next day and preparations needing to be made that day. Opaque sheeting was draped over the mural through windows above it.

The resulting effects of SCP-6589 killed 38 people:
* 29 Civilian bystanders
* 3 Foundation response personnel
* 4 Online observing Foundation personnel
* Himself

After the opaque sheeting was draped over SCP-6589 a letter was found on Caine’s person. It was found to have cognitohazardous effect on the people who read it after multiple viewings. A full image, which has been scrubbed from any cognitohazardous effects, of the letter is supplied below.

{{I do not understand what is happening for the life of me. I have no idea whatever this is or whatever it could mean. There doesn’t seem to be any reason why this man went out the way he did.}}

{{I am unsure if this thing actually works the way we expect it to. We haven’t tested it since. They deny any test I suggest or submit for evaluation. Something about 7 Foundation personnel being enough deaths.}} 

{{Someone, on their own, just created a memetic kill hazard on their own and that’s not important enough to test? How could we possibly protect the people who don’t see beyond the veil if this is a possibility?}}

{{I’m going to make sure I know what it means and hy it was created. This letter is also not really giving me a clearer picture. I’ll just have to view it for myself. I’m sure I will find the meaning then and that meaning is going to help me to protect the people on the easy side of the veil.}}

**{{[Recording started 12:33]}}**

{{//recorded section of livestream starts in the middle of a story told by Caine. It shows a crowd gathered to look at the creation of what was to become SCP-6589.//}}

{{**Caine:** So beyond what we see there is a lot more we can not even grasp. There are different people who will tell you different things on this same subject. A lot of those will tell you it’s all lies.}}

//Caine continues spray painting the wall stepping on small steps apparently set up to reach certain places.//

{{**Caine:** I am with a specific group, one that knows about the mysterious. One that knows about some of the unexplained things in our world.}}

//Caine moves to spray paint something to the side.//

{{**Caine:** Are We Cool Yet? Now that’s there within an estimated 15 minutes there will be people here trying to stop me. I do not need that long, however.}}

//GoI activity is noted by Foundation memetic response A.I. and MTF-Upsilon-23 is dispatched at 13:09 to the location of the live stream. This response is confirmed by 4 Agents remotely observing the live stream.//

{{**Caine:** Believe it or not. I need very little time to make everyone wonder and worry about the meaning and reason of my work.}}

//Caine paints one more quick line and steps a couple of steps away from the work. Within 5 minutes sounds of retching can be heard from the crowd and Caine can be seen gasping for air. Before the arrival of MTF-Upsilon-23 Caine retches blood and falls over.//

{{//**Note:** It is noted that at the time of the recording the 4 Agents on remote observation experienced the same symptoms as Caine and the other people in the recording. At this time a distress signal was sent. The memetic response A.I. needed time to analyze the new memetic hazard created in front of it before it scrubbed SCP-6589 from the recording.//}}

//MTF-Upsilon-23 reached the scene of the livestream and can be heard nearing the location of the livestream.//

{{**Agent Hendersson:** Time to find this guy, remote come in, everyone on scene seems down…}}

//Agent Hendersson can be seen entering view of the livestream with Agent Farley and Agent Hall following close behind.//

{{**Henderson:** Remote? Come in. I have visual on the-}}

//At this point Agent Hendersson gets cut off by his own inability to continue breathing. Agent Hendersson set off a distress signal as he could not alert his fellow agents to his situation. Agent Hendersson can be seen falling over as Agents Farley and Hall can be seen rushing towards Hendersson. As Hendersson collapses both Farley and Hall get visual on SCP-6589 and start showing the same breathing issues and eventual collapse. At this point Agent J. Hitchcock took over remote monitoring.//

{{**Hitchcock:** ALL AGENTS CLOSE YOUR EYES. I REPEAT. AGENTS OF MTF-UPSILON-23 CLOSE YOUR FUCKING EYES.}}

{{**Hitchcock:** Agents on scene, you’re dealing with a Cognitohazard that has already resulted in the deaths of 4 remote response agents, 3 on scene agents, and an unspecified number of civilians. Another approach is necessary. The Cognitohazard is located on the wall of the building directly to your northeast. Ensure no more civilians get close. Reinforcements are on the way. Wait for the all-clear.}}

//Agent J. Hitchcock made a call for two field agents to enter the building covertly and to cover up SCP-6589 with opaque sheeting with the reason given being construction that was going to start the next day. This information had to be implanted in the business while agents were being deployed.//

//Approximately 30 minutes later the view on the livestream changes as the sheeting is draped over SCP-6589.//

{{**Hitchcock:** MTF-Upsilon-23, you have the all-clear. Secure the perimeter, fences are being brought in to secure all from civilians. Ensure no one gets close until the anomaly is fully secure.}}

//Agents of MTF-Upsilon-23 can be seen checking over bodies. One agent comes up to the camera.//

{{**Agent F. Sanders:**Well, thanks for watching. Look fences are here, we’ll report back as soon as we can.}}

//The view of the camera turns around and shows the Foundation trucks sent to deliver fences arriving on scene before the recording cuts out.//

Meaning
[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;artA&#34;]]
A strange concept in a world that makes very little sense.
With no one to tell you what anything means, is there any meaning?
What is the meaning of anything?
Is there a meaning to the abstract?
Is there a meaning to life?

You certainly expect there to be.

If nothing means anything is it worth anything?
If life means nothing then why are we here?

Is there even a reason to life, in a world this truly unpredictable?

I’ll leave you with a hint about the meaning of anything.

Is there a meaning when our creator is dead?
