Watching UFOs on ET highway.
@@ @@
Waiting for package. Cold out here. Where are they?
@@ @@
@@ @@
Saw the following UFOs:
* Black sphere with long tail.
* four-winged craft with plated surface.
* oblong with pyramid on top.
* One that resembled a rose.
* lights, 24 of various sizes
* disk shape with turbine beneath it
Some interdimensional possibly? Be nice to obtain one.

See deliverers. Nice ship.

[[div class=&#34;page&#34;]]

Got package. Deliverers were well-mannered. English was a bit off but OK.
@@ @@
Also I can see UIU agents in distance watching. I&#39;m acting like I can&#39;t see them. Fools. See faint red, definitely have a camera and recorded my transaction.
@@ @@
Will intercept them.

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;page&#34;]]

Destroyed evidence and applied amnestics (__NOTE:__ get more).
@@ @@
UIU agents still incompetent. Good.
@@ @@
@@ @@
Package warm and light despite being large. Opened it and got the goods. Five bars of Alloy 7 [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-148 (compare with Prometheus Lab synthesized ver.)], 3 bars of Mekhanium, and 1 cylinder containing anti-matter (half for Lefty, owe him).
@@ @@
Will be useful at my lab and I could use the Mekhanium to repair some old tech I found.
@@ @@
First I will be staying at a motel. I am tired.

[[div class=&#34;page&#34;]]

An interesting event occurred last night.
@@ @@
I was abducted by mechanical entities with a cephalopod appearance. They had blasted me from the motel into their ship. Called themselves &#34;the Children of Mekhane&#34; (they even called themselves as Servants too interchangeably. Overall, Mekhanites.) and interrogated me for the Mekhanium. It was stated as &#34;stolen&#34; and I was able to see the mangled remains of the deliverers. Poor guys.
@@ @@
They planned to torture me, but as I was left unattended I escaped.  I traversed the ship and found that we were high in the sky. I had to return for the materials were camouflaged in my motel room. Foundation agents could have already been snooping around the area.
@@ @@
As a somewhat of a diversion and way to get down, I crashed the ship. Had to fend off the Mekhanites though (ET weapons are great and must take to Lefty. Need to make ammo). Obviously, I survived the crash but lost my left arm. Regeneration always stings for severed limbs.
@@ @@
So made it back and recovered the items. Foundation agents were few, and most went to crash site. Long night.
