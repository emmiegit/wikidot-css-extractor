&gt;

&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **Object Class:** Euclid

&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **Proposed Object Class:** Neutralized
&gt;

&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **Reason for Proposal:** The subject turned into a baseline domesticated dog during containment efforts and no longer displays any anomalous properties whatsoever.

&gt; Dr. Williams, Site-65 Director
&gt; 09/17/2019
&gt; [[/&gt;]]

On 09/25/2019, a meeting was held on Site-65 to discuss Dr. Williams proposal and determine an appropriate course of action. The meeting was recorded via visual and audio devices for posterity. 

**Attendees:** Dr. Williams (Site-65 Director), Dr. Atmos (Regional Director), Dr. Laicux (Regional Containment Specialist).

[[collapsible show=&#34;Meeting Log - Part A&#34; hide=&#34;Hide Meeting Log&#34;]]

//The group enters the room and sits at a round table. Dr. Atmos and Dr. Laicux shuffle through several papers while Dr. Williams places a briefcase on the floor beside his chair.//

**Dr. Atmos:** Let&#39;s see here... Ah, here we go.

**Dr. Laicux:** All good?

**Dr. Atmos:** Yes, yes. Let&#39;s begin. Dr. Williams, we&#39;re gathering today to discuss your proposal.

**Dr. Williams:** Alright.

**Dr. Atmos:** As you probably suspected, we&#39;ve already reviewed the request prior to this meeting. It&#39;s very uncommon for an anomaly - a reality bender, nonetheless - to be reclassified as neutralized. 

**Dr. Williams:** I am well aware of that and stand by my proposal. There are many ongoing projects that could use the resources we currently have allocated to SCP-5118.

//Dr. Laicux straightens his stack of papers on the table.//

**Dr. Atmos:** Dr. Laicux?

**Dr. Laicux:** Dr. Williams... To what degree are you confident that the subject currently in containment is the same subject encountered by the task force?

**Dr. Williams:** Are you suggesting it swapped places with a dog?

**Dr. Laicux:** No, I&#39;m asking about how confident you are that it didn&#39;t.

**Dr. Williams:** I&#39;m certain, without a doubt. 

//Dr. Williams lifts his briefcase on to the table and taps its side.//

**Dr. Williams:** May I?

**Dr. Laicux:** Please do.

//Dr. Williams opens the briefcase and removes an SD card. He walks to the other side of the room towards a small SD card reader connected to a projection screen and inserts it.//

**Dr. Williams:** If I may direct your attention to the following moments of the footage...

//Dr. Williams fast forwards through the video for a while before pausing it.//

**Dr. Laicux:** What exactly are we looking at here?

**Dr. Williams:** One of the frames from MTF-Alpha&#39;s camera. The others show it too but this angle is the clearest.

**Dr. Laicux:** Show what?

**Dr. Williams:** Take a look in the corner of the frame. Do you see it? A dog&#39;s foot... human&#39;s leg.

**Dr. Laicux:** I see. So, the actual metamorphosis was caught on film. I suppose that reasonably rules out the possibility of a different subject.

**Dr. Atmos:** Dr. Williams, can you please rewind the footage to the moments before the metamorphosis?

**Dr. Williams:** Uh-huh, sure.

//Dr. Williams proceeds to rewind the video again.//

**Dr. Atmos:** Right there, stop!

//Dr. Williams quickly hits the pause button.//

**Dr. Atmos:** This is the subject in frame?

**Dr. Williams:** Yes, that&#39;s correct.

**Dr. Atmos:** Is it... smiling?

**Dr. Laicux:** Hm. It does kind of look like it. Almost like a smirk.

**Dr. Williams:** It&#39;s probably distortion from the camera movement. It could even just be that it was breathing through its mouth during the pursuit and it happened to look like a smile on video.

**Dr. Atmos:** Yes, that is a possibility. Can you skip through the surrounding frames a bit?

//Dr. Williams skips through the previous and upcoming seconds of the video frame-by-frame.//

**Dr. Atmos:** The subject&#39;s face is only visible in the first frame?

**Dr. Williams:** On this tape, yes. There were two other members on the team who also had cameras.

**Dr. Atmos:** I see. We&#39;re going to take a short recess then, during which Dr. Williams will retrieve the footage of MTF-Beta and MTF-Gamma.

**Dr. Williams:** Uh... Okay, sure.

//Dr. Williams leaves the room.//

------

**Dr. Atmos:** So?

**Dr. Laicux:** I&#39;m not sure.

**Dr. Atmos:** Same here.

**Dr. Laicux:** Everything so far points to-

**Dr. Atmos:** I know.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Meeting Log - Part B&#34; hide=&#34;Hide Meeting Log&#34;]]

//Dr. Williams returns to the room holding another briefcase.//

**Dr. Atmos:** Any issues?

**Dr. Williams:** Nope, I&#39;ve got them right here.

**Dr. Atmos:** Perfect. Please play MTF-Beta&#39;s camera footage.

//Dr. Williams removes the previous SD card from the machine and inserts another one from the second briefcase before skipping through the video.//

**Dr. Atmos:** Right there, I think this is the same moment.

**Dr. Laicux:** Yeah, it&#39;s still hard to tell, though.

**Dr. Williams:** I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s a smile.

**Dr. Atmos:** What about Gamma&#39;s angle?

**Dr. Williams:** Right here.

//Dr. Williams swaps the SD card for another one. He fast forwards the video to the same point.//

**Dr. Atmos:** You can&#39;t really see the subject&#39;s face in this one.

**Dr. Laicux:** Unfortunately not, too bad. Are there any photos of the subject on file?

**Dr. Williams:** Just the post-containment one we took for its document. 

**Dr. Laicux:** Hmm... Any missing person reports for the area?

**Dr. Williams:** None at all. 

**Dr. Laicux:** That&#39;s odd to say the least... Previous containment of humanoids have almost always been followed-up on by addressing a missing persons report.

**Dr. Atmos:** Indeed.

**Dr. Williams:** Without a doubt, it lived alone. If there&#39;s no missing persons report, it might not be in contact with its family. Bet that makes post-containment follow-up a bit easier, huh?

**Dr. Laicux:** If only it worked that way, Dr. Williams.

**Dr. Atmos:** Can you please rewind the video to the first moment the task force made visual contact with the subject?

**Dr. Williams:** No problem.

//Dr. Williams rewinds the footage as requested.//

**Dr. Williams:** There?

**Dr. Atmos:** Yes, that&#39;s fine. Please play it.

//Dr. Williams plays the video. SCP-5118 is sitting on a bench as described in its article.//

**Dr. Atmos:** Dr. Williams, do you notice anything significant about the following scene?

**Dr. Williams:** Yeah, definitely. It&#39;s sitting out in the open. Normally, a reality bender would try to hide its abilities upon discovering them, but this one just wandered into a busy public park and couldn&#39;t care less who saw it.

**Dr. Atmos:** I see. And what was the name of this park?

**Dr. Williams:** Hyde Park. Some off-leash dog park in the middle of the city.

//Dr. Atmos and Dr. Laicux do not respond, scribbling intently on their notepads.//

**Dr. Williams:** Is everything alright?

**Dr. Atmos:** Everything is fine, Dr. Williams. I think we&#39;re going to take another recess now.

**Dr. Williams:** Already? But it&#39;s only been-

**Dr. Atmos:** We&#39;ll resume in 10 minutes. Please leave the room.

**Dr. Williams:** Er... Alright...

//Dr. Williams leaves the room.//

------

**Dr. Laicux:** It definitely looked like a smile, but we can&#39;t rule out the possibility that it wasn&#39;t.

**Dr. Atmos:** True, but we can use other evidence from the video to support that...

**Dr. Laicux:** What do you mean?

**Dr. Atmos:** Look at the video...

**Dr. Laicux:** I mean, yeah, it makes sense that it&#39;d be in a dog park of all places.

**Dr. Atmos:** That&#39;s actually not what I was referring to...

**Dr. Laicux:** What is it, then?

[[/collapsible]]
[[collapsible show=&#34;Meeting Log - Part C&#34; hide=&#34;Hide Meeting Log&#34;]]

//Dr. Williams re-enters the room.//

**Dr. Atmos:** Ah, Dr. Williams. Shall we continue?

**Dr. Williams:** That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been wanting to do...

**Dr. Atmos:** Great. Please have a seat, then. I wanted to ask you a few more things.

//Dr. Williams sits back down in his seat.//

**Dr. Atmos:** Now, the snacks that SCP-5118 was seen eating...

**Dr. Williams:** Mhm?

**Dr. Atmos:** Did anything significant stand out about the subject&#39;s choice of snacks?

**Dr. Williams:** What? No... 

**Dr. Laicux:** Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Atmos. On that topic, I wanted to ask you if SCP-5118 has ever requested these snacks while in containment?

**Dr. Williams:** It&#39;s a dog... It can&#39;t talk...

**Dr. Laicux:** Very well.

**Dr. Atmos:** Let&#39;s continue through the video, then.

//Dr. Williams stands from his chair to hit the play button. The video shows SCP-5118 eating snacks, breaking attention from its snacks only temporarily when a dog walking by with its owner barks at it.//

**Dr. Atmos:** Interesting.

**Dr. Williams:** What? Without a doubt, it&#39;s just eating junk food.

**Dr. Laicux:** Dr. Williams... I&#39;d like to move onto the topic of the subject&#39;s current containment.

**Dr. Williams:** Of course. Standard canine containment, as per policy.

**Dr. Laicux:** Yes, yes, I can see that from the document. I&#39;m more curious as to the subject&#39;s mood surrounding current containment procedures.

**Dr. Williams:** Um, happy I guess? It gets three meals a day and new toys, so why wouldn&#39;t it be? 

**Dr. Laicux:** And does the subject interact with its assigned staff?

**Dr. Williams:** Yeah. Whenever they go into the chamber to give it food or replace the toy, it jumps up on them all playfully. Some of the staff even started calling it &#34;Goldie&#34; since it&#39;s a Golden Retriever. Creative, I know. I&#39;m still writing up the disciplinary reports for those staff, but it seems to like the name... Saying it gets its attention.

**Dr. Atmos:** I see. Dr. Williams, I think we can conclude this meeting. Dr. Laicux and I have to discuss a few things before moving forward with a decision. 

**Dr. Williams:** Alright. Now what?

**Dr. Atmos:** Please return to your office. We&#39;ll page you to return once we&#39;ve made a decision.

**Dr. Williams:** Will do. Thanks.

//Dr. Williams leaves the room.//

------

**Dr. Laicux:** That was short.

**Dr. Atmos:** Yeah, but I&#39;d already made my decision during the last recess.

**Dr. Laicux:** You did? What did you see?

**Dr. Atmos:** Dr. Williams came back in before I could show you. Here, screenshot this frame of the video and send it to my drive. I&#39;ll be right back.

//Dr. Atmos leaves the room while Dr. Laicux does as requested. Around 5 minutes later, Dr. Atmos returns to the room holding a piece of paper.//

**Dr. Laicux:** What&#39;s that?

**Dr. Atmos:** Take a look. I had to zoom in and crop it, but it&#39;s pretty legible if you ask me.

**Dr. Laicux:** No way...

**Dr. Atmos:** So you&#39;ve come to a decision as well, then?

**Dr. Laicux:** Without a doubt.

**Dr. Atmos:** Now you&#39;re sounding like Dr. Williams. I&#39;ll page him back in.

//Dr. Williams enter the room again.//

**Dr. Atmos:** Hello, Dr. Williams. We&#39;ve come to a decision on your proposal.

**Dr. Williams:** Fantastic, and?

**Dr. Atmos:** Your proposal for reclassification has been denied.

**Dr. Williams:** What? That&#39;s preposterous! What&#39;s the reason?

//Dr. Atmos reveals the piece of paper he had shown Dr. Laicux.//
