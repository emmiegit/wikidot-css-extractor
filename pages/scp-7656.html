**Item #:** SCP-7656

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Embedded Foundation agents within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission are to install 7656V6[[footnote]] The 6th iteration of a signal-detecting device utilized to detect, transcribe, and intercept any and all SCP-7656-1 events. [[/footnote]] software among all signal broadcasting towers across the United States and Canada. If any of the devices record an SCP-7656-1 event, they are to activate an interception signal on all devices within a 25-kilometer radius of the initial detection for the duration of the SCP-7656-1 event. Any transmissions intercepted by 7656V6 devices are to be recorded both locally and externally for further analysis. Agents within the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/telecommunications-monitoring-office-hub Telecommunications Monitoring Office] are to monitor the region affected by the SCP-7656-1 event for a period of 48 hours following any events, in addition to embedded Foundation agents within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission monitoring potential information breaches within any broadcasting system which may have witnessed the SCP-7656-1 event. 



**Description:** SCP-7656 is an estimated 1.78m tall Caucasian male with disheveled brown hair that reaches its shoulders. SCP-7656 will appear during SCP-7656-1 Events in a state of delirium, psychological stress, physical stress, injury, and/or being physically assaulted by SCP-7656-2 instances. In SCP-7656-1 Events, SCP-7656 will wear a black and white business suit and white sunglasses over its eyes.

SCP-7656-1 is a spontaneous broadcast interruption that will occur on any given day between the hours of 21:14 to 23:20 Central Daylight Time, broadcast from an unidentified source that will periodically appear on television broadcasts within the Northern U.S. and Southern Canada. These broadcasts have been recorded to vary in length from 00:03, to 06:37[[footnote]] The transcribed time is recorded in a &#34;(MINUTE):(SECOND)&#34; format. [[/footnote]]. All SCP-7656-1 Events are identifiable from a unique electromagnetic wave pattern emanating from the temporary source of the disruption, and will always contain SCP-7656 paired with distorted audio and video. Frequently, the SCP-7656-1 Events will contain entities wearing traditional French maid outfits paired with a black face mask, dubbed SCP-7656-2. SCP-7656-2 instances have black hair, and are difficult to differentiate between other instances due to the identical similarities in its clothing and facial covering. All SCP-7656-1 Events contain a consistent theme of SCP-7656-2 instances attacking and torturing SCP-7656 with varying means of implementation. 

The source of SCP-7656-1 Events is currently unknown to the Foundation. SCP-7656-1 Events are sporadic in nature, with no discernible pattern of events being identified.



**Discovery:** On November 22nd, 1986, three separate SCP-7656-1 Events occurred within the cities of Detroit, Michigan, U.S., and Dayton, Ohio, U.S. during local evening news coverage. Due to the unknown origin of the events, and the unique broadcast signal discovered, SCP-7656 was deemed anomalous and efforts were made to limit civilian knowledge following the conclusion of Incident-7656-1-1. Recordings of the SCP-7656-1 Events were seized from broadcasting stations that experienced the SCP-7656-1 Event.

-----

The Foundation was alerted to the existence of SCP-7656 via the interception of numerous phone calls by the Telecommunications Monitoring Office. Agents were dispatched from Site-11 and Site-81 to Dayton where a cover story was established that the SCP-7656-1 Event was a TV hijacking. Further news stories and the spread of information was controlled to prevent the knowledge of the SCP-7656-1 Event from spreading to more individuals. All recordings containing or referencing SCP-7656 or sensitive information were seized and brought to Site-81 for storage and analysis.

[[/div]]

Further investigation and efforts to determine the location and identity of SCP-7656 were inconclusive. SCP-7656 was confirmed to be anomalous following two back-to-back SCP-7656-1 Events in [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3462 Bend], U.S. on November 29th, 1986.

**TV-Broadcaster:** What just happened? Did that man just drink bleach? Ladies and gentlemen at home, please stand by.

-----

All recordings of the 4th and 5th SCP-7656-1 Events were seized, in addition to similar protocols to cover the SCP-7656-1 Event as a TV hijacking. Following Incident-7656-1-2, surveillance technology was placed within all TV broadcasting studios in the U.S. in the event of a following SCP-7656-1 event until proper containment mechanisms could be developed.

[[/div]]

No further SCP-7656-1 Events were recorded for the remainder of 1986 and 1987. Containment procedures were relaxed following the October 18th, 1987 conclusion that the SCP-7656-1 Events in 1986 were isolated events in nature. On June 14th, 1988, the Foundation intercepted numerous reports from civilians across Hill County, Montana, U.S. detailing a TV hijacking similar to an SCP-7656-1 Event. At the time that Foundation agents began to monitor the broadcast in which the SCP-7656-1 event was occurring, researchers were able to further isolate unique properties shown occurring during SCP-7656-1 Events, assisting in the development of 7656V1 devices.

-----

This SCP-7656 Event is the longest currently known to the Foundation. Analysis of the game theme hummed by SCP-7656 prior to the termination of the SCP-7656-1 Event concluded that SCP-7656 is able to adapt to media and global events not limited to a date prior to Incident-7656-1-1. Furthermore, analysis conducted during the SCP-7656 Event resulted in the development of 7656V1 devices, which were promptly placed throughout North America. Recording capabilities were not present within the devices at that time.

[[/div]]

7656V1 devices documented the successful interception of 7 separate SCP-7656-1 events from June 14th, 1988 - June 19th, 1989. On January 19th, 1989, numerous reports were made describing an SCP-7656-1 Event in Bangor, Maine, U.S.[[footnote]] One of the last remaining areas in which 7656V1 devices had not yet been installed.

-----

The 14 civilians witnessing the event were amnesticized rather than given a cover story due to the limited number of civilians exposed to the SCP-7656-1 Event. Further analysis as to the identity of SCP-7656 began.

[[/div]]

Following Incident-7656-1-4, 7656V2 devices were developed, implemented, and placed at broadcasting stations across North America due to the risk of technological failures within 7656V1 devices. From Incident-7656-1-4 until September 30th, 1995, approximately 76 SCP-7656-1 events were intercepted by 7656V2 devices lasting for a duration between 00:00:15 - 00:03:24. Given the frequency of events, development began on 7656V3 devices to allow for the transcription of SCP-7656-1 Events. Development finished on 7656V3 devices on August 19th, 1995. On September 30th, 1995, an SCP-7656-1 Event was intercepted over Vancouver, Canada, and successfully recorded.

With the proven success of 7656V3 devices, development efforts began on the creation of 7656V4 devices to get significantly clearer audio and video transcriptions of SCP-7656-1 events.

[[/div]]

From Incident-7656-1-5 to December 22nd, 2006, approximately 89 SCP-7656-1 events were recorded. Although the vast majority contained little to no discernable audio. SCP-7656-1 events which did contain discernable audio did not bring notable information regarding the identity of SCP-7656 and as such, transcriptions are omitted for brevity. During March of 2006, both 7656V4 and 7656V5 devices were completed providing adjustments in the reliability of devices and the quality of the footage transcribed.

[[/div]]

From Incident-7656-1-6 to February 18th, 2010, all 13 SCP-7656-1 events recorded maintained a similar message. On February 15th, 2010, the development of 7656V6 devices was completed and the implementation of devices to replace 7656V5 devices began. On February 18th, an SCP-7656-1 event occurred in Coeur d&#39;Alene, U.S. which was one of the last remaining areas using 7656V5 devices.

//SCP-7656-1 laughs.//

**SCP-7656:** First I wasn&#39;t brought along, and now you all are trying even harder to hide my beautiful face?

//SCP-7656 yells.//

**SCP-7656:** I hear them digging. But I know they&#39;re not coming to save me! My chances are fading!

//SCP-7656 paces around the room and starts coughing violently.//

**SCP-7656:** Even if I try to end it all, my chances always just fall, because I am trapped inside this wall, for something that was barely my fault at all.

//SCP-7656 punches at the rubble.//

**SCP-7656:** A new challenge! Who can hold their breath the longest? Spoiler alert, it&#39;s me! It gets easier when you have no air to breathe.

//SCP-7656 laughs.//

**SCP-7656:** Remember kids, if you ever want to be like me all you need are the right friends and a bad motivation!

//SCP-7656 walks directly to the camera and stares into it.//

**SCP-7656:** Why didn&#39;t you get me help? Are you that scared of me? You don&#39;t have to be! It wasn&#39;t me who did it!

//SCP-7656 laughs.//

**SCP-7656:** I know the others had help after millions witnessed their performance! I guess no one knew about little old me thanks to your actions. 

//The camera beeps rapidly, indicative of many digital cameras at the time which beeped rapidly prior to powering off.//

**SCP-7656:** Oh no! Is that a bomb? Looks like this will be the finale of the show! I hope you all enjoyed watch-

//The SCP-7656-1 event ceases. It is believed that the camera used to record SCP-7656-1 events lost all of its battery, preventing the broadcast of SCP-7656-1 events. Based on the footage provided, efforts were reinvigorated to discover the location of SCP-7656-1.//

//SCP-7656 appears in a well-lit room. Rainbow-colored paper is seen decorating the walls and several variations of different colors of helium balloons are visible. SCP-7656 has numerous bruises across its face and a black eye. SCP-7656 additionally appears malnourished in contrast to the last known footage of SCP-7656. Words spraypainted in the background are visible, reading, &#34;We found you!&#34; and, &#34;Even when the cameras are off, the fun never ends!&#34;//

**SCP-7656:** After so long, it is time for a return we have all been waiting for! Since our last venue was brought out of commission, we have had to find a new place to broadcast from!

//SCP-7656 looks around the room.//

**SCP-7656:** And what better way to celebrate than to have a party! Right on our birthday!

//Numerous confetti launchers concealed from the vision of the camera go off simultaneously.//

**SCP-7656:** We all hope you didn&#39;t forget about us! Some things you forget right away!

**SCP-7656-2:** Others you will never forget for decades.

**SCP-7656:** In those cases, you should forgi-.....

//The SCP-7656-1 Event ceases for approximately 18 seconds. When the event resumes, SCP-7656 is in a visibly different position and SCP-7656-2 is out of frame. SCP-7656&#39;s nose is bleeding and there is a visible crack in SCP-7656&#39;s sunglasses.//

**SCP-7656:** No point in wasting any of our time! Let&#39;s get onto the cake!

//SCP-7656 sits down as two SCP-7656-2 instances approach SCP-7656 with a cake topped with 60 candles. Both SCP-7656-2 instances sing the song &#34;Happy Birthday To You&#34; and then shove SCP-7656&#39;s face onto the cake while the candles remain lit. The SCP-7656-2 instances keep SCP-7656&#39;s face there until their hair lights on fire, at which point they let SCP-7656 go, at which point SCP-7656 puts out the fire in its hair.//

**SCP-7656:** The cake tastes so good! Do you have any presents for me?

//Both SCP-7656-2 instances give SCP-7656 two presents. SCP-7656 begins to open all of them.//

**SCP-7656:** Ah, you shouldn&#39;t have, it&#39;s- ..... -with- ..... -and a teddy bear!?

//Foundation technicians attempt to use 7656V6 devices to cease the SCP-7656-1 event.//

**SCP-7656-2:** Looks like someone is trying to end our show early.

//SCP-7656 stands up and walks toward the camera.//

**SCP-7656:** Looks like our show will have to end early! Make sure to stay tuned for when we make our return soon!

//SCP-7656 laughs as the SCP-7656-1 event ceases.//

A severe analysis of all three sites&#39; internal security systems and the status of on-site 7656V6 devices has resulted in an inconclusive test as to how the SCP-7656-1 event managed to bypass the 7656V6 devices present. Development on the hypothetical implementation of higher-power 7656V7 devices has begun. Larger efforts have been placed in order to identify the location of SCP-7656.
