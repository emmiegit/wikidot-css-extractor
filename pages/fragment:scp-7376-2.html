**Special Containment Procedures:** All personnel entering SCP-7376-B must be wearing Class B biohazard suits and sprayed with Pheromone 7376. All exiting individuals are to be doused with a pheromone-neutralizing agent, to ensure that SCP-7376-B-1 instances do not attempt to follow personnel out.

Containment Area-25A has been built around the entrance to SCP-7376-B to prevent unauthorized access to the anomaly and house personnel. The Foundation is cooperating with the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment to minimize the likelihood of discovery by civilians.

Containment Area-25B has been constructed within SCP-7376-B&#39;s central chamber to aid in the direct monitoring of the anomaly and the containment of SCP-7376-A.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Refer back to Section 7376-A for additional information.[[/span]]

Samples taken from the anomaly are to be transported to [[[secure-facilities-locations | Storage Site-23]]], to be compared with preserved samples from other [[[sarkicism-hub | Nälkän]]] organisms.

**Description:** SCP-7376-B is a living SK-BIO Type 005[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]**[[[scp-2095 | SK-BIO Type 005:]]]** A Nälkän structure entirely composed of living organic matter (bone, keratin, chitin, skin, adipose, etc.). Nälkä, who refer to them as //&#34;kiraak&#34;//, primarily use them as temples.[[/span]] organism beneath the Upper Taz Nature Reserve in the Russian Federation. Though its interior has not yet been fully mapped out, it is estimated to be at least 10,000 m². Despite the fact that SK-BIO Type 005 organisms must regularly be fed by their caretakers to survive, no evidence of human activity in or around SCP-7376-B has been discovered.

SCP-7376-B-1 is the collective designation given to dramatically enlarged SK-BIO Type 006[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]**[[[scp-2815 | SK-BIO Type 006:]]]** Symbiotic annelids commonly found within Nälkä and Nälkän organisms. Known to the Nälkä as //&#34;akuloth&#34;// and &#34;His Sacred White Worm&#34;.[[/span]] organisms that live within SCP-7376-B. Where typical SK-BIO Type 006 organisms are 1-2 cm in length, smooth, and yellow-white, SCP-7376-B-1 instances are 2-3 m long, weigh 70-80 kg, have rough, pale white skin.

Like a normal SK-BIO Type 006 colony, SCP-7376-B-1 appears to collectively act as a symbiotic &#34;secondary immune system&#34; for its host body, attacking any foreign entity that enter SCP-7376-B. This protective instinct can only be circumvented through use of Pheromone 7376, a nonanomalous yet potent chemical substance that the organisms naturally produce. Foreign entities that have been doused in the pheromone are either ignored or followed by SCP-7376-B-1 instances.

These organisms were initially assumed to be their host&#39;s means of retrieving sustenance. However, testing has shown that the SCP-7376-B-1 instances are not inclined to leave SCP-7376-B, only doing so willingly if lured with Pheromone 7376.

[[include component:image-block

The structure&#39;s central chamber contains SCP-7376-B-2, a 3 m tall upright coffin composed entirely of anomalously-durable bone that has partially merged with the chamber&#39;s northern wall. The seal of Klavigar Orok[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]**Klavigar:** Honorific given to the four individuals closest to Grand Karcist Ion, the prophet and founder of the Nälkä religion.[[/span]] has been engraved into SCP-7376-B-2&#39;s lid; it is understood to primarily symbolize the concepts of restriction and liberation. Beneath it, there is a phrase in an obscure variant of Old Adytite[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]**Old Adytite:** An early dialect of Ämärangnä, the Nälkä language.[[/span]] that roughly translates to //&#34;throne/tomb of the one who guards/dreams/drowns&#34;//.

Only one passageway connecting SCP-7376-B to {{[REDACTED]}} has been found. A lesser-known Nälkän symbol that is theorized to represent Ab-Leshal[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]A rarely-mentioned figure in Nälkän history. Refer back to Section 7376-A for details.[[/span]] has been scarified into the flesh above its threshold.

**Addendum 7376-B-2: History**

Nälkän religious texts, recorded folklore, or historical records that directly or indirectly refer to SCP-7376-B have not yet been found. At time of writing, it seems that the Nälkä community as a whole is completely unaware of its existence.

The 1986 establishment of the Upper Taz Nature Reserve creates the possibility that one or more individuals in the Soviet government were attempting to keep SCP-7376-B hidden. However, there is no indication that [[[gru-p-hub | GRU Division &#34;P&#34;]]] was ever aware of the anomaly.

On 02/09/2000, ENOCH.AIC flagged several reports of an individual matching SCP-7376-A&#39;s description within the Upper Taz Nature Reserve. Scans performed during the ensuing search alerted Foundation agents to the presence of a massive heat source beneath the ground; subsequent investigation led to the discovery of SCP-7376-B&#39;s entrance.

**Addendum 7376-B-3: Awakening Event**

On 03/30/2000 at 03:49 AM GMT, sensors stationed in SCP-7376-B-2&#39;s chamber picked up a sudden surge of heat from the anomaly in question. Further examination revealed that blood flow towards SCP-7376-B-2 had also sharply increased and that the anomaly was producing a faint organic pulsing sound.

Dr. Svetlana Volkov, Dr. Grigori Antonov, and Technician Zinovy Lebedev were promptly dispatched to set up additional monitoring equipment around SCP-7376-B-2.

//[Dr. Volkov, Dr. Antonov, and Technician Lebedev all enter the chamber holding bags of monitoring equipment, each wearing a Class B biohazard suit. Technician Lebedev begins erecting the equipment, while Dr. Volkov and Dr. Antonov set themselves to calibrating it.]//

**Dr. Antonov:** Has the coffin&#39;s temperature raised at all?

**Dr. Volkov:** No, it seems to have stabilized at 93 degrees Celsius. On the dot.

**Dr. Antonov:** Christ, that&#39;s hot. You sure it&#39;s not 93 Kelvin?

**Dr. Volkov:** Nope, it&#39;s Celsius. I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s not slow-cooking the flesh around it.

**Technician Lebedev:** //[Muttering.]// Why would 93 Kelvin make any more sense? That&#39;s fucking //cold//.

**Dr. Volkov:** Did you say something?

**Technician Lebedev:** No.

//[All present continue with their duties in silence for nearly ten minutes. There are several moments where vague movement is seen in the periphery of the camera&#39;s view. All present do not appear to notice.]//

**Dr. Volkov:** Do we have any movement inside the coffin?

**Dr. Antonov:** Nothing that we can see. At least half our sensors can&#39;t seem to penetrate this thing. I&#39;ll check the waterproofing, see if anything&#39;s broken.

**Technician Lebedev:** Unsettling.

**Dr. Volkov:** Yeah, everything about this place makes me uneasy.

**Dr. Antonov:** Of course you&#39;re uneasy, we&#39;re in a subterranean meat temple.

**Dr. Volkov:** //Not just that.// Think about it—all the Sarkic[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]&#34;Sarkic&#34; is a slur to the Nälkä. Foundation personnel are strongly discouraged from using this term, especially while in the immediate presence of Nälkän peoples or anomalies.[[/span]] temples we&#39;ve found are either long-deceased or getting fed regularly. 7376-B isn&#39;t dead, clearly—but nobody&#39;s been feeding it. We haven&#39;t found any evidence that anyone&#39;s used this place since it was built. How&#39;s it still alive?

**Dr. Antonov:** Could it be that -B&#39;s being sustained by an anomalous effect? Some kind of thaumaturgic or carnomantic ritual to sustain a temple indefinitely?

**Dr. Volkov:** I had the same thought, but I doubt it. If Sarkites knew how to keep their temples alive without food, why haven&#39;t they been doing that all along?

**Dr. Antonov:** Maybe it&#39;s too costly or difficult to bother with most of the time.

**Dr. Volkov:** Then why save that trick for a temple they never used? No, it&#39;s far more likely that it&#39;s feeding by some other means--and I&#39;ll bet you anything those means are &#34;downstairs.&#34;

**Dr. Antonov:** How would //you// know? We&#39;re not even allowed down there.

**Dr. Volkov:** Got a gut feeling about it.

**Technician Lebedev:** //[Muttering.]// Pretty sure we&#39;re //in// a gut.

**Dr. Antonov:** Is your gut telling you anything about this stupid coffin?

**Dr. Volkov:** Nothing, besides the obvious.

**Dr. Antonov:** And that is?

**Dr. Volkov:** We need to figure out what&#39;s going on with this thing and //fast//.

//[More movement in the camera&#39;s periphery.]//

**SCP-7376-C:** In that, I may be of some assistance.
