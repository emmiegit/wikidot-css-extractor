[[include component:image-block name=truck.jpg|caption=SCP-2445 during initial recovery near ██████, Wisconsin.]]

**Item #:** SCP-2445

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2445 is to be kept within the AVB (Anomalous Vehicle Bay) at [http://www.scp-wiki.net/secure-facility-dossier-site-81 Site-81].

**Description:** SCP-2445 is a white, mostly unmarked tractor trailer. Of note is the inclusion of a label on the bottom right of the rightmost back door, which reads:
[[=]]
&gt; Wondertainment Logistics Co.
&gt; A Division of Dr. Wondertainment Inc.
[[/=]]
Beneath the engine hood of SCP-2445&#39;s truck section is a modified engine component, designated SCP-2445-1, capable of producing significantly more power than that of a standard semi-truck. SCP-2445-1 is routed to a machine within the cab, designated SCP-2445-2, which is currently believed to be the source of SCP-2445&#39;s anomalous characteristics.

SCP-2445-2 is a black, metallic cube, measuring at 0.6m x 0.6m x 0.6m, that sits between the driver&#39;s and passenger&#39;s seat in the cab of SCP-2445. Attempts to open or inspect the interior of SCP-2445-2 have been unsuccessful. Two large cables connect SCP-2445-1 to SCP-2445-2 through the dashboard of the cab. Eight smaller cables run from the SCP-2445-2 into the dashboard, on which sits a large touchscreen. Across the top of this screen are the words &#34;WonderVision&#34;. This screen appears to be the control module for SCP-2445-2, and is activated whenever SCP-2445 is started. 

When activated, the control screen for SCP-2445-2 displays an intro message, and then changes to a login screen. Login requirements appear to be a username, password, skin sample, and retinal scan.

After logging in, several options are listed. The options, and their function, are as follows.

* **WonderFinder:** Displays a heat map of the region surrounding SCP-2445. The function of this option appears to be a means of locating delivery sites. Areas containing a high concentration of young children, such as a school or park, appear dark red. 

* **WonderHider:** Activates a mechanism that renders the entirety of SCP-2445 invisible to the naked eye. 

* **WonderZoom:** Creates a temporal anomaly surrounding SCP-2445, appearing to significantly slow the flow of time outside of SCP-2445 in relation to the interior, allowing SCP-2445 to move through space as if time was standing still. While active, an additional indicator light titled &#34;WonderSpatialDistortionFixer&#34; also illuminates.

* **WonderTransfer:** Opens a large categorized menu of children&#39;s toys, all apparently manufactured by Dr. Wondertainment. Selecting an object from the menu causes the object in question to appear after a period of time, packaged, on a shelf in the trailer of SCP-2445. An option for quantity appears alongside each object, with no apparent upper limit. Certain categories are locked, and attempting to access them will cause notifications such as &#34;Seasonal Product Only!&#34; and &#34;Not Applicable to this Ethnic Group!&#34; to appear.

* **WonderHome:** Returns SCP-2445 to a main Dr. Wondertainment distribution hub. Option currently locked out, and attempting to access this option returns a &#34;Not so fast!&#34; notification.

Additionally, a number of apparatuses are present within the main cab that appear to be designed in order to protect the driver from the temporal and spatial anomalies incurred while operating SCP-2445. These include a series of intravenous syringes containing unknown liquid compounds, a heads-up display designed to sit directly in front of the driver, and a helmet covered in 20 different leads that connect directly to SCP-2445-2. 

**Discovery Information:** SCP-2445 was discovered on 11/15/2009 near ██████, Wisconsin, when SCP-2445 appeared to malfunction and come into contact with a sedan during a major winter storm. Local authorities were alerted when the open trailer began to spontaneously release instances of a previously unknown Wondertainment product, all of which took flight and began detonating around SCP-2445. 

When the number of released instances became higher than what could feasibly fit within the confines of the trailer, Mobile Task Force Alpha-13 &#34;Meat Packers&#34; was activated and dispatched to contain SCP-2445. Forty-five individuals were administered Class C amnestics, and a cover story of a wrecked semi carrying a shipment of fireworks was released to the local newspaper. 

SCP-2445 was moved to Site-81, along with the driver, who was officially brought into Foundation custody after a brief hospital stay.

**Interview 2445-A:** //The following interview took place on 11/20/2009, shortly after the discovery and containment of SCP-2445, and after the driver, a Caucasian human male named Clarence Prince, was released from Foundation medical custody.//

&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Roberts:** Alright, let&#39;s get started. Your name, sir?
&gt; 
&gt; **Clarence Prince:** Who&#39;s askin?
&gt; 
&gt; **Roberts:** This will go much easier for both of us if you can cooperate, sir.
&gt; 
&gt; **Prince:** I reckon I might be in a lick of trouble if I speak to the wrong people, //sir//. Who&#39;s askin?
&gt; 
&gt; **Roberts:** I&#39;m a member of an organization of inter-dimensional traffic safety officers. I need information about the nature of your vehicle, and the freight you ship.
&gt; 
&gt; **Prince:** Well, I&#39;ll be damned. You ain&#39;t got a badge or nothin, do you?
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Roberts produces standard Foundation ID tag.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Prince:** Shit, I didn&#39;t mean nothin by that earlier. Name&#39;s Clarence Prince, humble transport extraordinaire. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Roberts:** Mr. Prince, could you tell me about the vehicle you operate?
&gt; 
&gt; **Prince:** Well, ole Hillary is a tough girl. I&#39;ve been drivin&#39; a long time, and I ain&#39;t seen nothin that can put it to it like she can. In fact, come to think of it, I ain&#39;t seen nothin like her at all, period. She&#39;s a whole different set of tires.
&gt; 
&gt; **Roberts:** I assume you&#39;re referencing-
&gt; 
&gt; **Prince:** The engine, sure. Thing looks like it came outta a goddamn space movie. Lots of blinkin lights and techno gizmos, sure. But it don&#39;t need no fixin, and it don&#39;t need no fuel. Hard to argue with that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Roberts:** And the box inside?
&gt; 
&gt; **Prince:** Oh, that&#39;s what the garage boys call the &#34;Wondervision.&#34; Like a computer, you know, only it does things a little different. Takes some gettin used to, sure, but she runs like a dream once you get the nuts and bolts covered.
&gt; 
&gt; **Roberts:** Can you tell me anything about your employer, Mr. Prince?
&gt; 
&gt; **Prince:** You mean the doc? Can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever met him. I mostly just deal with the garage boys and the distro boys, and I don&#39;t got much to say to either. Whenever somethin goes wonky, I take &#39;er to the garage boys. Whenever I need to park, I take &#39;er to the distro boys. I get my routes, and then off I go.
&gt; 
&gt; **Roberts:** How did you come to work for Dr. Wondertainment?
&gt; 
&gt; **Prince:** Well, I was hauling out of Atlanta for a while. I guess I was real good or somethin, cause one day I show up and my truck is gone, and Jerry, that was my supervisor, tells me I&#39;m gettin a promotion. Next thing I know, some goons dressed like them fancy English guards push me into a van and drive me to somewhere. I do some paperwork, get my face all pictured pretty on this here identification badge, and then I&#39;m set. They pay the bills, I move the freight. Pays real good, too. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Roberts:** What was happening that caused your vehicle to malfunction?
&gt; 
&gt; **Prince:** You know, Hill&#39;s a beast of a girl, real good on the open road and real good in the weather too, but you gotta be real careful with that WonderZoom. Garage boys tell me there shouldn&#39;t be nothin wrong with the handlin on ice when you&#39;re movin at light speed, but I&#39;m gonna need to have a talk with them cause my back end jackknifed like I ain&#39;t never seen, and next thing you know I&#39;m off in the ditch and my ass is shootin sparks. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Roberts:** Alright, thank you. That will be all, Mr. Prince.
&gt; 
&gt; **Prince:** No problem, boss. Say, I ain&#39;t gettin ticketed for this, am I? 
&gt; 
&gt; [END LOG]

**Incident Log 2445-D:** On 03/15/2012, during routine testing of SCP-2445, Clarence Prince was unable to log in to SCP-2445-2, even after repeated tries. After several attempts, a notification appeared on the main display of SCP-2445-2, which read as follows:

&gt; Not so fast, Foundation goons!
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Wondertainment hopes you have enjoyed your demo of our newest product, WonderShipping!
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, your trial period has ended. No worries, though! We&#39;ll send somebody out as soon as we can to collect the product.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again for your cooperation!
&gt; 
&gt; //P.S. Tell Clarence his last check is in the mail. Traction on ice at light speed works just fine, but trying to drift around vehicles in the carpool lane does not.//
