[[size large]]##2C4A78|**Description:**##[[/size]]

The body of Moise Nguy, former mayor of Moway-Lubwe, DRC. Object contains several cybernetic modifications of thaumatological origin. Modifications include mechanical implants, such as joint-integrated hydraulic shock absorbers and infrared-capable retinas. The brain of LTE-6362 is roughly 60% intact, with the remainder of it being replaced by a cybernetic device of unknown origins. 

Modifications appear to cluster around the right shoulder of LTE-6362, with their frequency and size declining in body parts more distant from that region. A small power outlet is located in the right axilla of LTE-6362.

Physiological changes exhibited by LTE-6362 are consistent with those exhibited by members of the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/external-relations-orientation-robotic-republic Robotic Republic]. Closer analysis revealed that no modification was implanted earlier than 02/10/2062. Due to the large amount of brain matter being replaced, it is difficult to assert the degree of independence possessed by Nguy during the events leading up to his death.

LTE-6362 exhibits a gunshot wound in the thoracic region, which it sustained during a confrontation with a group of local residents on 04/10/2062. Both lungs as well as the heart were essentially obliterated by a close-range shotgun blast. Cause of death appears to be rapid exsanguination. 

+ ##2C4A78| PHYSICS Report##
++ ##2C4A78| Investigation ##

In an effort to determine the origin of LTE-6362, the PHYSICS Division was tasked with performing an investigation on the threat and compiling a report of their findings. As part of the investigation, Coalition operarative Dr. Nils Kristiansen conducted several interviews with local residents of Moway-Lubwe. Partial transcripts of these these interviews can be found below.

&gt; {{**Date**: 07/10/2062
&gt; **Interviewer**: Dr. Nils Kristiansen, PHYSICS Division Command, OP Socrates Operative (98262063/825)
&gt; **Interviewed**: Pascal Umba (42), engineer employed at Moway-Lubwe-based prosthetics manufacturer. Claims to be in possession of potentially relevant knowledge.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Preamble:** Umba has been a close associate of Moise Ngoy for decades, with Ngoy being the designated godparent for his oldest son. Interview was conducted in a makeshift office located in an unoccupied commercial building.}}
&gt;
&gt; ------
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** You mentioned that you might know something related to the incident. Can you elaborate on that?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Umba:** Honestly, I’m not sure if it’s really something worth recording. It’s just something I thought of, you know?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** Anything can be of use to us, Mr. Umba. Don’t worry about whether it’s true or not. Verifying that is our job.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Umba:** //(slowly, almost hesitant)// I…}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Umba:** I think I know what happened with Moise.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** Please, continue.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Umba:** Okay. So, Moi- uh, Mr. Ngoy was turned into a robot, right? Or replaced by it. I think. Now, recently, I’ve been thinking about what could have happened, and last night, I suddenly remembered something. You see, Mr. Ngoy had his own peanut farm. And right next to one of these fields, there was this old pile of scrap that kept making these weird noises when he drove past them on his tractor. Really strange.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Umba:** Now, I don’t know if this has anything to do with what happened. It’s just a thought. But a few hours ago, I drove to where that thing was located, and it’s gone now. Completely gone.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** Can you tell me more about what the pile looked like? Were there any identifying marks or symbols or anything of that sort?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Umba:** No? It was just a pile of scrap, really. About as big as my truck. Maybe a bit bigger. I think it was made out of stainless steel or something, since there was no rust on it. Plenty of chunks were painted red. Some of them white.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Umba:** There were these weird letters all over the thing. I couldn’t tell you what they meant, but they looked Russian. I think they looked Russian, anyway. I never learned Russian.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Umba:** If I did, I maybe -}}
&gt;
&gt; {{//Umba looks out of the window, and sighs.//}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Umba:** Moise always wanted to sell that thing to some scrap collector. He just never found the time for it, you know? There was always so much stuff to do - expanding his farm, maintaining his vehicles, helping in the construction of some new houses around here, all of that. Moise was busy all the time. Kept talking about his parents, how they did everything for him, and how he plans to do the same for his own children. You know, work himself to the bone for a better future.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Umba:** He never got to have children.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** But his legacy lasts, doesn&#39;t it?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Umba:** I guess.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Umba:** //(slightly louder)// It does.}}
&gt; ------
&gt; = {{**SEE: SELECTED INTERVIEWS 1**}}
&gt;
&gt; In absence of any further leads, it was decided to perform a closer investigation of the object mentioned by Umba. Although the resulting fieldwork resulted in the discovery of no significant object, a lack of vegetation along one spot coupled with a slight depression in the ground indicated that the testimony of Umba was mostly or entirely correct.   
&gt;   
&gt; In response to these findings, Coalition agents attempted to contact any local citizens who might possess knowledge on the object.

&gt; **Interviewer**: Dr. Nils Kristiansen, PHYSICS Division Command, OP Socrates Operative (98262063/825)
&gt; **Interviewed**: Gabriel Mputu (84), retired cook.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Preamble:** Gabriel Mputu is the oldest person in Moway-Lubwe. As a hobbyist historian, Lubwe maintains a detailed record on the history of the village and is continuously working to expand it. Interview was conducted in the private residence of Mputu.}}
&gt;
&gt; ------
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** You mentioned that you might know something about the history of that pile of scrap. Could you elaborate on that?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Mputu:** Frankly, I don’t know much.This thing’s older than me, and probably older than my father. My great uncle - God bless his soul - told me some stories, but I’m really not sure if they’re anything more than just that. But I do recall some things. It’s a long story.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** I’m all ears.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Mputu:** So, about a hundred and fifty years ago, there was this massive war. Pretty much every country wanted their slice of the pie. The Belgians, the Russians, the Americans, all of them wanted their hands on this country. It’s called the Congo Crisis. Maybe you’ve heard of it.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Mputu:** Probably not.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** //(irritated)// Mr. Mputu, I know what the Congo Crisis is. I wrote my dissertation on it. My employers are not just letting anyone travel down here, you know.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Mputu:** You don’t know anything, doctor. You read some books, and you wrote some books, but you haven’t experienced the effects of it.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Mputu:** My grandfather was involved in it. I never knew what he did, he never told us. All I know is that he never got to see my father grow up. Or me, for that matter. The war took something from everyone, and from him, it took his eyes. I only knew him for a short while, but even as a young boy, I saw how hurt he was. Not just his body, but his soul as well.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** Well, I -}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Mputu:** Anyway, the Russians had a hand in it too. Their faction of choice was Stanleyville. What Stanleyville was or what it stood for doesn’t matter - the Soviet Union didn’t care about that, so I won’t as well. All that mattered was that it was an easy way for them to access some rocks below us.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Mputu:** Of course, they didn’t send their own sons to fight and die in our war. That would be unacceptable. Instead, they forced us to fight, and flooded our country with all kinds of weapons. Rifles. Grenades. Ammunition. Scopes. No tractors, though. Not even machetes. Their ships brought death, and that is all they brought.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Mputu:** One day, one of their trucks arrived in our village. It just suddenly appeared at night. Completely empty. I still don’t know what happened with it - maybe the driver decided to make some fast cash, maybe it returned from a delivery and broke down, whatever. It doesn’t really matter.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Mputu:** Now, my great uncle Alphonse had to work in the manioc fields every morning. He was a young boy, only about seven years old, but he couldn’t afford not to - education was a luxury, and it was a luxury nobody of us could afford. And one time, when he walked from his village to the field to do some weeding - couldn’t be later than six in the morning, I think - he saw this thing just crawl out of the truck. He said it was some kind of red metal thing, something that shouldn&#39;t have been able to move on it&#39;s own, but still did. Alphonso said that he immediately ran away upon seeing that thing, so he wasn’t sure on the details, but he was utterly convinced that he saw it.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** That sounds odd. How did the other villagers react?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Mputu:** Oh, they didn&#39;t take him seriously at all. He was only about ten years old at the time, you see. Everyone believed that he was just a kid making stuff up. And who knows, maybe he was? I don’t know either.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** What happened afterwards?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Mputu:** Well, that’s when that huge pile of scrap showed up. Everyone just assumed it got dumped there by the truck. It made sense, you know? There were some plans to sell it, but nobody could find a buyer for a pile this small and the whole thing eventually just petered out. Life went on.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Mputu:** And look, it turned out well, didn’t it? Moise suddenly disappearing was the most tragic thing the village has experienced in years. Back when I was a child, it wouldn’t even have been the most tragic thing that happened this week. This whole affair has been going on for more than a month now, and there’s no sign of it stopping. I understand where they are coming from, Moise was a great man who did amazing things for this village, but even I feel like this is unprecedented.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** With all due respect... isn&#39;t that a great thing? Most people want to live in a place that doesn’t experience a new tragedy every few days. Everyone wants peace.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** I know, I know. But -}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Mputu:** //(cutting Dr. Kristiansen off)// Listen, Nils. People are growing soft. Our children don’t know how good they have it. Just yesterday, a child kept telling me about his chicken farm. I kept listening, and was proud that a boy this young was already capable of helping out in the household like that - and then he told me the chickens weren’t even real. They existed inside his computer. What is the world coming to?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Mputu:**I’m a dinosaur. I’m one of the last people to remember true hardship. I know hunger. I know fear. I know grief. Back when I was a young man, just barely coming out of age, I swore to myself that my children would never go through what I did. I held pens, swords, and plowshares. I did anything I could, and then some more.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Mputu:** All that, just for some boy to raise his computer chickens. Was it worth it?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{//(Mputu falls silent for a few seconds. Afterwards, he starts to laugh.)//}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Mputu:** Of course it was! What was I thinking?}}

&gt; {{**Date**: 10/10/2062
&gt; **Interviewer**: Dr. Nils Kristiansen, PHYSICS Division Command, OP Socrates Operative (98262063/825)
&gt; **Interviewed**:  Charles Ilunga (61), farmer running a midsized tea farm near the outskirts of Mowa-Lubwe}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Preamble:** Ilunga, a farmer, has been a frequent collaborator with Ngoy on numerous agricultural initiatives. Although he was not directly employed by Ngoy, he possesses significant knowledge regarding the internal operations of Ngoy&#39;s farm. Since Ilunga was in Korea during the investigation, the interview was conducted via a video call.}}
&gt;
&gt; ------
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** Good morning, Mr. Ilunga. Or, good afternoon. Can you hear me?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Ilunga:** Yes, yes, I can hear you quite well. The connection seems to be working fine.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** That’s a relief. I was a bit concerned about the connection dropping, but it seems to be functioning for now.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Ilunga:** Indeed. Honestly, I do regret having taken that vacation in the first place. I leave the village for one week, and then this happens - there’s always the nagging thought of “you could have prevented this”, even though I know on a rational level that I almost certainly couldn’t.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** I know you’ve probably heard that before, but - really, it was just an unfortunate coincidence. It could have happened at any time. You’ve probably left the country a bunch of times before, and nothing happened on these days either.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Ilunga:** Oh, no. This is the first time I’ve ever left the country.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** Really? That&#39;s quite the journey for your first time}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Ilunga:** You could say that. I suppose I could have done it a few years ago, but I just never found the opportunity to. There was always so much stuff to do. There’s still a lot of stuff to do, but… well, I’m getting older, you see. Hiking through the northern Korean mountains wasn’t going to get easier for me, that’s for certain.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** Of course. You and Moise probably contributed a great deal to this community.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Ilunga:** Really, it was mostly Moise. He was at it for more than forty years, and he just never quit. It was a gradual process, you know - we didn’t just wake up one day with all of our problems solved. We made some small progress, every day - building another few ditches for a new irrigation system, chasing the last drug dealer out of town, putting up some posters that tell people not to litter, and so on. Small steps.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Ilunga:** Of course, there’s still lots of work to be done. Renovating the old train station, adding a proper tennis court to our sports club, and so on - a few weeks ago, we started working on implanting an intelligent traffic light system, and you won’t believe how complicated and labor-intensive the whole affair is. I sit on the committee for the darn thing, and I still don’t understand it.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Ilunga:** I just hope that whatever happens here in twenty years will be so incomprehensible that I won’t be able to grasp the mere concept of it. Now, this might sound a bit arrogant, but… Moise and I have pushed this village ahead for so long. It’s about time it leaves us behind.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** You could say that. Speaking of the village - have you ever noticed a scrap pile near one of Mr. Ngoy&#39;s fields?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Ilunga:** Well, I... wait, yes, I’ve seen it a few times. Did something happen to it?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** We are currently looking into the possibility of the pile being related to the incident. Did you ever notice any unusual behavior?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Ilunga:** Unusual behavior? What is that even supposed to mean? No, of course not. That said… I think I heard Moise talk about it a few times, in passing.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** What did he say?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Ilunga:** Not much. He mentioned that it used to whirr and make these clack-clack sounds when he drove his tractor near it. Said that it sounded kind of funny. Nothing more than that.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** Thank you, this could help us a lot. Is there anything else you might find worth mentioning?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Ilunga:**Uh.. No, I think we’re done here. I’m glad I could be - }}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Ilunga:** Wait, I think I just remembered something.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** Go on.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Ilunga:** Well, the last few seasons have been great, right? The weather was amazing, we haven’t had any problems with insect swarms, and the new fertilizers we’re shipping in from Kenya are doing great things. So, Moise finally got himself a nice sum of cash - not enough to live off until he dies, but enough to make a real difference, you know?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** ...Yes. Continue, please.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Ilunga:**Anyways, Moise finally got himself some money. And for the past few years, he has always been complaining about back pains. Keeps talking about how he can’t handle walking for long distances anymore. He was getting older, you see. Just like I am, hehe.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{//(Ilunga chuckles and sighs simultaneously.)//}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Ilunga:** So one day, he bought a robot plane to help with monitoring the fields, or something like that. One of these really fancy ones from Somalia. The thing hadd like twenty different features - advanced all-weather flying capabilities, high-tech AI-driven pest detection, and so on. Moise basically memorized the entire manual of the thing, and he never stopped telling us about it.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Ilunga:** Now, he hasn’t actually used this thing until about a week ago. Never had any reason to. And on the very next day, he - or whatever pretended to be him - started his ill-advised attempt. Maybe it’s just a coincidence, but…}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** //(interrupting Ilunga//) Wait, wait, wait. This is huge. Can you tell me more about the AI functions of the robot?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Ilunga:** Ha! No, I can’t. Who do you think I am? All I know is that it was supposedly really advanced, and that’s it. My nephew’s studying computer science in Kisangani, maybe you should ask him. He’s so good with that computer stuff.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** I’ll… consider it, thank you. But did you ever see Mr. Ngoy talk to this plane? Like one would talk to a human?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Ilunga:** Hm. No, I think not. More like a dog, I suppose.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Ilunga:** Honestly, I believe that the whole AI thing was just hogwash. Advertising, and nothing more. Everyone was saying that it was smart, but I don&#39;t think that it ever did any smart things - it just looked the part. And God, was it annoying.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** Annoying how?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Ilunga:** It kept talking while it was in the air.  At first, I thought it was impressive, but then I realized it was just repeating the same phrases over and over. Like a broken record.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Ilunga:** Now that I think about it, I really can’t believe I fell for that gimmick. For about two days or so, I thought it could actually think. How silly of me.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** ...I see.}}

&gt;
&gt; Following the interview, Coalition agents performed a more thorough search of Ngoy’s private residence. The search unearthed a hidden pile of several electronic goods, including multiple cell phones and a drone matching the description of Charles Ilunga.  
&gt;
&gt; It should be noted that the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/external-relations-orientation-robotic-republic Robotic Republic] is reported to be extremely opposed against human use of artificial intelligence. It is still unclear if the drone used by Nguy was involved in the &#34;activation&#34; of the dormant entity.

&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** We’re currently working on figuring that out. How did people react to this message?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** Oh, they were mostly just confused. We weren’t quite sure if he was joking or not. Some speculated that he had some sort of psychotic break. It was all very puzzling.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** Some old people - like, really old - were kind of scared, though. Like, I even saw some of them pray. Muttering about how this couldn’t be happening again, and stuff like that. That was weird.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** What happened afterwards?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** At first, not much. People were just stunned, right? I don’t think that anyone even considered joining him. We were just confused.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** Eventually, some of us decided to check up on Mister Ngoy ourselves. Like, to see what was happening, right? If he was forced to do this, or anything like that. We just couldn’t believe that this was actually him. So, Maurice, Sylvain, Lucie, Serge, and me all got together and decided to do this whole thing together.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Ilunga:** Interesting. Why’d you choose to bring guns?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** Well, we didn’t know what to expect. If he suddenly, like, started attacking people, it’d be dangerous, right? Same if he was held hostage, for some reason. So, we needed something to defend ourselves.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** Now, Maurice’s dad had this gun collection, right? Like twenty rifles and shotguns. Well, we quickly got to his house and, uh, equipped ourselves. I got some rusty old AK, I think. It looked like it hadn&#39;t been used in decades. Maurice told me it had some historical value to this village, but whatever. Point is, we all took some guns, right?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** And you went to Mr. Ngoy’s residence right after that?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** Yeah. So, as I was saying, me and some other people from the village got into our trucks and drove to Nguy&#39;s house at Lake Mwezi at as fast as we could. We even took the new road, and Sylvain *never* drives on the new road. He’s always talking about the toll being a scam. But honestly, I think he’s overreacting. It’s not even that expensive, he spends more on coffee every day. Right?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** ...Right.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** Right.}} 
&gt;
&gt; //(Both momentarily pause. After a short while, Kanku continues.)//
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** So, we drove right to the farmhouse, and we just went in, right? First, we knocked, but no one responded, so we thought that something was happening inside. Kicked the door open and all. Checked the corner. You know. Anyways, the first floor was empty.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** Wait, please hold on for a minute. How do you know how to raid a building? You sound like you have a lot of experience with that matter, but as far as I know, the last armed conflict in this area took place roughly twenty years before you were born.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** Oh, I played some video games. Got a whole setup in my garage, it’s pretty cozy. RGB lightning and all that.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** ...Okay, that would explain it.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** Anyways, that’s when we moved to the second floor. That’s where we found Moise. Or, uh, whatever was pretending to be Moise.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** Did you notice anything unusual with him?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** Well, no, but.. yes, kind of? It wasn’t anything concrete, he just seemed strange. Like, everything was normal, but we somehow all knew that it wasn’t him.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** What did he do?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** He tried to talk to us. Like, he was basically holding a speech. Kept trying to convince people to join his, uh, its movement. It was bizarre, right? The whole thing sounded nothing like anything he ever said. No one actually joined him or even pretended to be interested, but he just kept going.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** How did you respond?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** We - we were just stunned. He didn’t sound like the Moise we knew at all. Hell, he didn’t sound like anyone we know. Closest thing would be some speech from a history book - you know, like some warlord or bandit leader. Completely… I think the word is “anachronistic”, right? Like, it maybe could have worked like fifty years ago, but no one was falling for it now.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** Go on.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** Right. So, at first we didn’t know what to do, right? We just stood there, looking at each other.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** Eventually, Sylvain spoke up. I think he wanted to help Moise. I can’t remember exactly what he said - it all happened so fast, but he told him that we were going to get him to a hospital. For a check-up or something like that.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** For a check-up?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** Yeah. You know, I once heard that brain tumors can cause people to go crazy. I think that’s what Sylvain wanted to do - get him into a hospital, perform some x-rays, that sort of stuff. It did seem like the most logical explanation at the time.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** How did he react?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** That’s when he attacked us. It - it was a blur. We never expected anything like that. For a sixty-two year old man to move this fast… it was indescribable.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** He grabbed Sylvain, and just started choking him out. Like, completely dead-eyed. I don’t think his expression ever changed.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** Our reports indicate that Mr. Ngoy was, uh, taken down by a shotgun blast to the chest. How did you get a clean shot?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** Right, I was just getting to that. So, Moise choked Sylvain, and then he just… kind of stopped? Like he got cramps, or something. His hands were all jittery for a few seconds, and that was all Sylvain needed to escape. I still don’t know why that happened.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** That’s when Serge pulled the trigger. I didn&#39;t see him doing it, but the sound was unmistakable. My ears were ringing,the whole room was filled with smoke, and Moise… he just crumbled. Fell over instantly. He didn’t even clutch his chest.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** Is this when you discovered the mechanical parts in his body?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** I - yes, that was it. There was this huge cable running next to his, uh, the big artery coming out from the top of his heart, and -}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** The aorta?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** I guess? Anyways, the whole cable was next to it, and it didn’t look like your usual pacemaker at all. None of us ever saw a pacemaker, but still.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** I see. Afterwards, you took pictures of it and shared them on your social media accounts. Is that correct?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** I did. It was originally supposed to be just for some of my closest family members and friends, but… things got out of hand, I suppose.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** They certainly did.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** I think that covers about everything I wanted to discuss with you. Thank you for your time.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** Hey, no problem. You guys are doing great work. We all want to find out what happened to Moise.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** Before I go… you’re from Norway, right? Kristiansen sounds Nordic to me.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** .. Yes, good catch. Why’d you ask?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** There&#39;s nothing concrete yet, but - I&#39;m thinking of moving there.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** Honestly, this place is a dump. I just want to get out.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** Really? I haven&#39;t been here for long, but it seems beautiful to me. Almost picturesque.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** Oh, you don&#39;t even know. If you want to get anything delivered, you’ll have to wait for at least two days. The clubbing scene sucks. And I haven’t even mentioned the lack of employment opportunities here.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** The… lack of employment opportunities?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** //Duh.// There are no jobs. None that matter, anyways. I looked up some in the area to see where I could work after university, and the nearest cybersecurity gig is at least one hour of commuting away. Oslo’s looking better, right?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** I&#39;m not sure. I haven&#39;t been there in a long time.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** //(quieter)// A long time.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** Ah, that’s too bad. Oslo is just a really appealing city, you know. The architecture and all that. Kinshasha and Kumasi are on the top of my list, but Oslo is definitely a solid contender as well.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** People always tell me to stay here, but I don’t get it. Why? It’s just a village, y’know. Some houses and some roads. Nothing special.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** Anyways, I think that’s it. Sorry, I kind of rambled there.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** //(almost inaudible)// ... I would stay.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Kanku:** Huh? Why?}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** Nevermind. Forget that. It&#39;s not what I&#39;m here for.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{**Dr. Kristiansen:** Ms. Kanku, thank you for this interview.}}
