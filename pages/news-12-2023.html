Tale tags are here! In an effort to aid readers in finding content that they enjoy, genre and content tags have been added to tales. These tags include a variety of genres such as comedy, fantasy, etc. There are also setting tags, such as dyspotian, western, and more! To learn more about the new tags and their definitions, you can check out [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/tale-tagging-guide |the tale tagging guide]]]. Authors are also encouraged to follow this guide to tag their own tales, and there are rules and guidelines for those interested in helping tag other people&#39;s tales! Happy tagging!

In case you didn&#39;t know, The Wanderer&#39;s Library now has its very own Reading Club! Their first session was on October 6th, and they read spooky tales of wonder from the Library to celebrate the season. The hosts; LAN, Rounderhouse, Piano, and UncertaintyCrossing, plan to meet every two weeks to host further readings. 

Much like the SCP Wiki Discord&#39;s Reading Club, members of the audience are sometimes brought onto the stage to help read sections of an article and voice act their hearts away. It&#39;s great fun for everyone involved!

If you&#39;re interested in listening to these Reading Club sessions live, join the Wanderer&#39;s Library [https://discord.gg/FrsGp6j Discord Chat] and check the announcements channel for the next reading. If you missed one, never fear! They are all recorded and posted to [https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/wanderers-library4 Spotify] for your listening pleasure. 

We hope to see you soon!

+ Writing Prompts
[[/div]]

Site News is bringing you monthly writing prompts! Every month there will be three user-submitted prompts to help inspire new pieces. Participation in these prompts is completely optional, and any pages based on the prompts will be featured in the next issue of Site News! If you&#39;re interested in submitting a prompt for next Site News, send a wikidot PM to [[*user ParallelPotatoes]]. One prompt submission per person per month, and up to five prompts will be shown in each edition of Site News. 

This month&#39;s writing prompts are below! 

[[size x-large]]Secure or Protect[[/size]] //Submitted by F1J7//
Write an SCP article with a high disruption class and low risk class, or vise versa.
You can find the full descriptions of disruption and risk classes [[[anomaly-classification-system-guide|here]]].

[[size x-large]]International GOI[[/size]] //Submitted by IcePhoenix44//
Write an article (could be a SCP, tale or GoI format!) about an international group of interest! The list of international groups of interest can be found [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/goi-index|here]]].

[[size x-large]]An SCP Article With an Imprimatur[[/size]] //Submitted by StrangerSwing//
Write an SCP article that includes an imprimatur! The imprimatur could be framed as cooperation between the Foundation and the Catholic Church, an interesting character as a clergyman confronting the anomalous, or whatever you decide to include!

[[size x-large]]An Article Named After You[[/size]] //Submitted by winkwonkboi//
Users tend to find inspiration in the many articles they read from the site, but who&#39;s to say the author behind them can&#39;t serve as an opportunity for creativity? Write an article (any format will do) based on another person&#39;s username of your choice.

[[size x-large]]Genreless[[/size]] //Submitted by psychicprogrammer//
Even though the new tale tags that were implemented this month encompass many genres, they don&#39;t encompass everything. Write a tale that you feel deserves the &#34;_genreless&#34; tag! A guide to tale tags and their definitions can be found [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/tale-tagging-guide |here]]].

The following article was inspired by a prompt and written this month!

[[size x-large]][https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7874 Checkpoint, Mate][[/size]] //Written by Edmund Davids//
Inspired by &#34;Roadside Curiosity&#34; from November 2023&#39;s prompts!

If you write an entry inspired by this or a previous month&#39;s prompts, feel free to send a wikidot PM to [[*user ParallelPotatoes]] to have it featured in the next Site News! There isn&#39;t a time limit on getting prompt submissions featured, so feel free to write for a previous month&#39;s prompts as well! [[footnote]]Please note than in the event of an official contest, contest entries that were inspired by a Site News prompt will be featured the month after the contest ends.[[/footnote]]
