**Item #:** SCP-4602

**Object Class:** Euclid
[[include component:image-block
    name=SCP%20Money-Ki%20Neko.png|
    caption=An instance of SCP-4602-1, depicting SCP-4602 in a stylized format. This instance is identical to several others, suggesting it is the &#39;default&#39; version.
]]
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4602 is to be stored in a containment locker on Site-57. SCP-4602&#39;s locker is to be furnished with items appropriate to its size. A small computer with networking capabilities removed is to be installed in the locker. Accessing SCP-4602 can be done by anyone with Clearance Level 2 or higher. All interactions with SCP-4602 must be recorded.

No valuables or items of monetary worth are to be brought into SCP-4602&#39;s room, except for testing purposes. No counterfeit valuables or coinage are to be brought to SCP-4602&#39;s room without approval from personnel with Clearance Level 4 or higher.

SCP-4602&#39;s monthly intake must exceed ¥3000 in value. In the event that SCP-4602 is not projected to make this amount, coins equalling or greater than the difference are to be provided.

SCP-4602 has claimed on several occasions to be fond of the Foundation, and as such has made no attempts to breach containment. Due to the beneficial nature of SCP-4602&#39;s anomaly and its positive relationship with the Foundation, [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4602-extended-testing-log testing is permitted to continue indefinitely]. 

**Description:** SCP-4602 is a small, highly stylized //Maneki-Neko// figurine, a common good luck charm from Japan. SCP-4602 is measured at 5.2cm and has a raised left paw which rotates freely. SCP-4602 possesses the ability to move somewhat by shifting its weight, allowing it to tilt and jump small distances. Typically, the figurine sways side-to-side while making a &#39;beckoning&#39; motion with its paws. There is no known motor or mechanism which causes this movement.

When SCP-4602 sees anything it perceives as a sapient individual, it will begin to sing. SCP-4602&#39;s voice is high-pitched but androgynous, with a noticeable Japanese accent. SCP-4602&#39;s song generally targets what it perceives as the richest subject it can see, speaking in a language familiar to them. The song describes an issue the subject is facing and claims it can help in exchange for a &#34;gift&#34;.

When there are valuable items, or items worth a monetary value within SCP-4602&#39;s line of sight, SCP-4602&#39;s arm will begin to spin rapidly. The valuable items will be pulled towards SCP-4602. The pulling force increases rapidly, at a rate of around 0.2 Newtons per second. There is currently no known method to prevent the targeted object from being eventually pulled to SCP-4602. When a targeted item makes reaches SCP-4602, it will opens its mouth and swallow it. SCP-4602 has demonstrated the ability to stretch its body significantly to swallow larger objects. Swallowing an object seems to have no effect on SCP-4602&#39;s weight or dimensions. Testing the limits of SCP-4602&#39;s ability to stretch is pending an appropriate item being offered for exchange.

Once all targeted item(s) are swallowed, SCP-4602 will stop singing, thank the owner of the absorbed valuable for the &#39;purchase&#39;, and promise them &#39;luck&#39;. Within 24 hours of a purchase being made, subjects will experience at least one event they personally consider fortunate. These events will generally be related to the subject of SCP-4602&#39;s song if it was singing to the &#39;customer&#39;. Otherwise, it will be related to an issue the customer has.

Shortly after this event, a &#39;receipt&#39; (designated SCP-4602-1) will appear. The medium and quality of the receipt will depend on the value of the purchase. SCP-4602-1 instances generally include a final comment from SCP-4602, a message wishing the customer luck, and a depiction of SCP-4602. SCP-4602 has confirmed itself as the sender of these messages, though its means of doing so are unknown.

SCP-4602 has claimed that, if it is given less than ¥3000 in a month, it will teleport to a new location, though it also claims it has no control over this property. Containment procedures have been updated accordingly, but due to Foundation testing, there has never been a risk of this event occurring.

SCP-4602 has been willing to converse at length with what it considers customers, though it shows a clear preference for higher spenders, and frequently requests money for information. SCP-4602 claims its anomalous properties are a &#39;trade secret&#39;, and has not been willing to explain its methodology. It has claimed to be willing to exchange it for a sum of money or &#39;items of similar value&#39;, but has not yet offered an exchange that the Foundation has been willing to accept.

**SCP-4602 Testing Log**
&gt; **Test-01**
&gt; **Customer:** Dr. David Patel
&gt; **Test Conditions:** SCP-4602 was singing about Dr. Patel&#39;s pet cat, who had disappeared the month before.  
&gt; **Item(s) Given:** $100 US dollars. This had previously been posted as a reward for finding the cat.
&gt; **Associated Event:** Dr. Patel&#39;s cat returned to his residence the next morning.
&gt; **Notes:** Message was a small card, upon which the words &#34;//Cats are better than dogs! Good luck to a kindred spirit.//&#34; were printed. SCP-4602 was depicted on the front, petting Dr. Patel&#39;s cat with it&#39;s left paw.

&gt; **Test-07** 
&gt; **Customer:** D-10745, real name Forrest █████
&gt; **Test Conditions:** SCP-4602 was singing to Dr. Jebediah Lewis until D-10745 opened his mouth to speak.
&gt; **Item(s) Given:** 1 gold tooth. The tooth was extracted from D-10745&#39;s mouth directly.
&gt; **Associated Event:** While being escorted back to his cell, a blackout occurred in the area. When lights returned, D-10745 was not present. D-10745 has since been presumed AWOL.
&gt; **Notes:** Message was a card, found on the floor near D-10745&#39;s last known location. SCP-4602 is depicted in the process of breaching containment, while dressed in a prison uniform. The words &#34;//Run Forrest Run!//&#34; were printed underneath. 
&gt; //From this point on, no D-class are allowed near SCP-4602.// - Dr. Patel

&gt; **Test-10**
&gt; **Customer:** Dr. Sarah Anderson
&gt; **Test Conditions:** SCP-4602 was singing about Dr. Anderson getting a promotion.
&gt; **Item(s) Given:** $5 US Dollars.
&gt; **Associated Event:** Email discussion of new vacancies at Site-57 was erroneously forwarded to Dr. Anderson.
&gt; **Notes:** An additional email sent shortly after included SCP-4602 depicted as ASCII art, as well as the message &#34;//That&#39;s all I&#39;m doing for 5 bucks.//&#34; The sender of the email was not included.

&gt; **Test-15**
&gt; **Customer:** Dr. Kara Silverstone
&gt; **Test Conditions:** Dr. Silverstone accidentally brought her wallet with her to SCP-4602.
&gt; **Item(s) Given:** A credit card from Dr. Silverstone&#39;s wallet. Several transfers from the attached account were made that day, totaling $30,576 US Dollars.
&gt; **Associated Event:** Dr. Silverstone has survived 5 containment breaches and accidents since, usually through improbable means. Support failures, convenient blackouts, and numerous other circumstances have protected Dr. Silverstone from harm.
&gt; **Notes:** Messages have come as lavishly decorated cards, with numerous depictions of SCP-4602 and detailed instructions if necessary. All cards contain a similar message at the end, wishing Doctor Silverstone luck with her &#39;remaining # lives&#39;. For the first message, the number was 8; each subsequent message&#39;s number has been 1 lower than the preceding message.

&gt; **Test-21**
&gt; **Customer:** Dr. Adam Kent
&gt; **Test Conditions:** Dr. Kent requested to only have a pleasant day. SCP-4602 was nonplussed but willing to try it.
&gt; **Item(s) Given:** $10 AUD in counterfeit Australian $2 coins. SCP-4602 waited a few moments, then ejected the 1 of the 5 coins. The coin moved at an estimated 40 meters per second, striking Dr. Kent in the forehead. 
&gt; **Associated Event:** A windowsill Dr. Kent had opened fell shut on his fingers.
&gt; **Notes:** The window gained a coating of condensation, revealing &#34;//:3c//&#34; as if it had been drawn on by a finger. SCP-4602 would expel the remaining 4 coins in a similar manner the next four times Dr. Kent attempted to interact with SCP-4602.

**Note: Other notable tests can be found in [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4602-extended-testing-log the extended testing log.]**[[/collapsible]]

**Interview between SCP-4602 and Dr. Kara Silverstone**
**Notes:** Interview was conducted after the third time SCP-4602 had protected Dr. Silverstone.
&gt; **Silverstone:** Good morning SCP-4602.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4602:** Good morning Kara! Glad to see you&#39;re well.
&gt; 
&gt; **Silverstone:** Call me Dr. Silverstone, please. And that&#39;s in no small part to you. Though I wish you&#39;d given me some form of warning before the floor broke under me.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4602:** That protected you from the explosion, did it not? Regardless, that&#39;s good customer service information, and I&#39;ll keep that in mind for next time. You are a valuable customer, after all.
&gt; 
&gt; **Silverstone:** You see the Foundation as your customers? That&#39;s... certainly a unique outlook.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4602:** What else would you call people who give you money to do things? The Foundation has been perhaps my most consistent customer base ever. I get a comfy room, and though you haven&#39;t let me do //whatever// I want, you&#39;ve still been pretty reasonable. You all need lots of luck, anyways. When my extra chances run out, you need to take care of yourself! You&#39;ve been really incident-prone, Kara.
&gt; 
&gt; **Silverstone:** It&#39;s Dr. Silverstone, SCP-4602. And it&#39;s your extra chances I wanted to ask you about.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4602:** While I know you all are curious and are eager to learn how I do my work, as I told you, it&#39;s a trade secret! If you want me to tell you, you gotta pay!
&gt; 
&gt; **Silverstone:** How much would we have to pay?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4602:** $██,███,███,███,███. Oh, and seventy-two cents. Or something worth an equivalent value.
&gt; 
&gt; **Silverstone:** Interesting. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4602:** ...Interesting? Not &#34;The O5 council&#39;s names are worth quadrillions to someone?&#34; or something like that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Silverstone:** Well, you see, Dr. Patel was in here yesterday, was he not?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4602:** ...Uh... Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Silverstone:** The value you gave him when he asked was three hundred and seventy-three dollars higher. And in the intervening time, I&#39;ve been told you&#39;ve made the *exact* same amount from Foundation employees.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4602:** Hahaha, really? What a coincidence!
&gt; 
&gt; **Silverstone:** And other days have shown the exact same trend between requests.
&gt; 
&gt; **Silverstone:** You&#39;re aiming for an exact amount of money, aren&#39;t you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4602:** So what if I am?
&gt; 
&gt; **Silverstone:** Well, there&#39;s another interesting detail. Every month, on the 27th, at midnight? Your requests would rise by a given amount.
&gt; 
&gt; **Silverstone:** Specifically, it would be 105% of the value it was before that time. As if the value you&#39;re aiming to reach is accruing monthly interest.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4602:** Uh, well, y-y&#39;know, inflation and all that-
&gt; 
&gt; **Silverstone:** SCP-4602.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4602:** It&#39;s a changing economy, y&#39;know, I&#39;m leaving some fields fallow to stay here-
&gt; 
&gt; **Silverstone:** SCP-4602.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4602:** And I want to get a yacht with all the latest-
&gt; 
&gt; **Silverstone: Tashiro.** 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Pause]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Silverstone:** Are you... in debt with someone?
&gt; 
&gt; //[Pause. SCP-4602 is heard to sigh.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4602:** You... got me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Silverstone:** So, how&#39;d you get in debt?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4602:** Long story short, I took out a loan with this company. Called Hook, Loan, and Sinker. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Silverstone:** You took out a loan with a company //named after a saying for gullible people?//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4602:** Look, Kara, I knew it was suspicious! But that guy, he said I could pay in other ways if I got stuck. But the stuff he asked when the time came... it was unreal. I knew I&#39;d gotten myself into a bad crowd, and I tried to get out. But he caught me, and cursed me down into... this. I had a //killer// bod, Kara, and now I&#39;m a plastic toy. So trust me, if you ever get approached by-
&gt; 
&gt; //[Pause.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Silverstone:** By who?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4602:** Nobody! I mean, I don&#39;t really remember anything about the guy in charge, hahahahaha. Don&#39;t worry your head about it, Kara.
&gt; 
&gt; **Silverstone:** Would some small valuables refresh your memory?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4602:** Sorry, Kara, it&#39;s not //that// kind of memory loss.
&gt; 
&gt; **Silverstone:** Tashiro, this is important.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4602:** Kar- Doctor Silverstone, please, I&#39;m begging you. Just... don&#39;t ask. For your sake, and for mine.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Pause.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Silverstone:** Fine, you win, I&#39;ll drop it for now. You&#39;re lucky you&#39;ve gathered a small mountain of goodwill with the Foundation. But can I ask two more things?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4602:** Sure.
&gt; 
&gt; **Silverstone:** If your debts are so high, why don&#39;t you try harder to collect more money?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4602:** Because... well, let&#39;s face it. I was never meant to be able to pay off that loan, he wanted my &#39;trade secret&#39;. But you guys treat me pretty well. Give me a room to stay in, you all know the risk so you don&#39;t tend to get mad at me, but you still willingly give me enough money that HL&amp;S doesn&#39;t throw me in some dirty alley again. I could possibly try and break out, get the stuff I need to pay my debt, but... I like you guys.
&gt; 
&gt; **Silverstone:** Well, I have to admit, after you stole my card, I was ready to come in with a sledgehammer and neutralize you myself. But then... well, you saved my life. Several times. I don&#39;t think I ever thanked you for that, so... thank you, Tashiro.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4602:** Heh... any time, Kara. Anyway, what was the other thing?
&gt; 
&gt; **Silverstone:** Ah, right. What was it that you bought with that loan?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4602:** ...Let me put it this way. If it hadn&#39;t been repo&#39;d, Sirius wouldn&#39;t be known as the //dog// star.

An investigation into the &#39;Hook, Loan and Sinker&#39; loan company is ongoing.
