**Item #:** SCP-6712

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Provisional Task Force Sigma-42 (&#34;Nomads&#34;) is to await and respond to SCP-6712 manifestation events and recontain it as soon as possible, preserving the game state through any means necessary up to and including lethal force. Sigma-42 is also tasked with amnesticizing witnesses and discrediting evidence of the manifestation events. Stationary Task Force Epsilon-12 (&#34;Settlers&#34;) is to play only one legal turn of SCP-6712 before returning it to Universe #UA-90B-6712 and preparing for another manifestation event. Under absolutely no circumstances is Epsilon-12 permitted to cheat.

**Description:** SCP-6712 is a copy of the multiplayer boardgame //Catan// that randomly manifests on Earth after being returned to Universe #UA-90B-6712. Upon manifestation, one turn of the game will have been completed by the &#34;opponent.&#34; The tiles and wooden pieces of the game have been hot glued to a sheet of cardboard while the cards and leftover pieces remain in the box. A sticky note reading &#34;Site-89 Break Room&#34; has been placed on the box.

During a manifestation event, a small orb of blue-white plasma emitting arcs of electricty will appear at a point on Earth. The orb will remain for approximately 30 seconds, illuminating the surrounding area and scorching any nearby material, before dissipating. In its place will be SCP-6712.

As of 14/7/2021, the game is at too early of a state for a winner to be properly predicted. The score is currently predicted to be 5 Victory Points to 3, opponent leads.

**Addendum 6712.1:** Creation

While researching the efficacy of extrauniversal travel at Site-89 in West Virginia, a faulty generator caused the █████ Apparatus to become overactive. In the process of shutting the Apparatus down, the entire East Wing of Site-89 including the break room was lost. Located in the break room was a copy of //Catan// used by personnel for entertainment.

Approximately three days later, SCP-6712 spontaneously manifested in Moab, Utah where it was recontained by Mobile Task Force Epsilon-6 (&#34;Village Idiots&#34;). All witnesses were amnesticized.

SCP-6712 initially manifested with one white road and one white settlement piece placed on the board. Due to the interest in researching extrauniversal entities capable of extrauniversal travel, a blue road and blue settlement piece were placed and returned to #UA-90B-6712. SCP-6712 continously remanifested until its current game state.

**Addendum 6712.2:** Notable Events

On 19/4/2021, a &#34;7&#34; was apparently rolled by the opponent and a card was taken from Epsilon-12&#39;s hand upon manifestation in Tokyo, Japan.

On 12/5/2021, Epsilon-12 traded resources for a &#34;Development Card&#34;, obtaining a &#34;Year of Plenty&#34; card.

On 14/5/2021, the opponent obtained the &#34;Longest Road&#34; card upon manifestation in Perth, Australia. Opponent leads 4 Victory Points to 2.

On 31/5/2021, SCP-6712 manifested in Shenzen, China with a handwritten note reading:
&gt; Two wood for one brick?
One &#34;brick&#34; resource card was placed with the note before being returned. SCP-6712 then manifested in Manila, Philippines with two &#34;wood&#34; resource cards in Epsilon-12&#39;s hand. This is the only time the opponent has communicated in relation to the game mechanics.

On 2/6/2021, Epsilon-12 replaced one of their settlement pieces with a city piece. Opponent leads 4 Victory Points to 3.

On 29/6/2021, a &#34;7&#34; was apparently rolled by the opponent and a card was taken from Epsilon-12&#39;s hand upon manifestation in Jardin, Colombia. The opponent also traded resources for a &#34;Development Card&#34;. Opponent possibly leads 5 Victory Points to 3.

On 1/7/2021, Epsilon-12 handwrote a note asking to trade one &#34;sheep&#34; resource card for one &#34;stone&#34; resource card before being returned. Upon SCP-6712&#39;s manifestation in Amsterdam, Netherlands, the cards were traded from Epsilon-12&#39;s hand.

On 3/7/2021, Researcher ███████ █████ took a resource card from the opponent&#39;s hand much to the dismay of his colleagues, in which he responded with offense. When SCP-6712 was returned, Researcher █████&#39;s skull spontaneously exploded, terminating him. SCP-6712 manifested a few hours later in Site-01 with only one road piece placed and a handwritten note reading:
&gt; Please don&#39;t do that. :(
The stolen card was immediately placed back in the opponent&#39;s hand, and Epsilon-12&#39;s turn was passed as a gesture of goodwill. SCP-6712 has yet to remanifest.
