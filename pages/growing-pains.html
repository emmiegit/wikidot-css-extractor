Two weeks had passed since the last therapy session as a result of Agent Sias’s sudden field work. At some point the Foundation had grown tired of waiting for one of their prized assets to get better. As soon as a job needing his department came up, Sias was called out and the sessions were temporarily suspended. 

As a result, the man who stumbled into Dr. Iglesias’s office was almost unrecognizable. His hair, even longer than before, had been partially tied back into a ponytail that hung halfway down his neck. Fine lines had begun forming on his face, leaving the 28 year old looking nearly 10 years older. The paint on his nails, normally kept in pristine condition, had grown cracked and had largely peeled away. 

Agent Sias flopped onto her sofa, mindlessly tugging at a black compression glove on his left hand. His brow furrowed in thought, and after a moment he turned his head toward Iglesias.

“Did I do good?”

Iglesias paused, looking back with a confused expression. “Pardon?”


“With 5828. Did I do good?”

Iglesias fingered through her notes before pulling out SCP-5828’s file. Her version was highly redacted, containing only vague information regarding where the anomaly was and what Agent Sias’s involvement with it had been. Any further specifics, from the names of others involved down to the contents of interviews, had been withheld by the higher ups. She adjusted her glasses before turning back to Sias. 

“How do you feel you did?”

“I don’t know,” he shrugged, “I was out of it. Those interviews don’t even read like me. Just a bunch of vague questions towards a bunch of grieving people. It’s a miracle any of them even talked to me given the circumstances.”

Iglesias nodded along, occasionally interjecting with a small sound of acknowledgement. Sias was talking, that alone was progress.

“I read the logs and I sound so… curt? Direct?” he continued, “Like these people lost their kids recently in what they thought was a //double suicide//, I couldn’t have been a bit more empathetic?”

He threw his hands up in exasperation. Iglesias giggled. 

“What’s so funny?”

“Sorry, it’s just… well I almost struggle to visualize you as anything but curt and direct,” she replied with a gentle smile, “But the fact that you’re being self-reflective like this is good. It’s one of the areas the higher ups asked me to work on with you.”
For the first time, Sias blushed and sheepishly rubbed the back of his neck. 

“I wasn’t always like this. Well…” Sias tapped a finger on his chin, “...I can’t actually say that. Weirdly enough lately I’ve found that I can remember when I was a kid pretty well. Another sign of things working here, I guess? Anyway I was kind of a miserable kid.”

“Are you ready to talk about it some?” Iglesias sat up with a smile. Sias grimaced before sighing.

“I guess I probably should, right? Gotta take that first step. When I was… eight, I think, my family moved to the states from Spain. Can’t really remember where in Spain we were from, but I //do// remember being really, really pissed off by it all. We talked about that night already, I think?”

Iglesias nodded.

“Okay. So yeah. It was pretty lucky that I met Wyatt in the end, honestly. He was practically feral as a child, but he really started to pull me out of my shell. Against my will, mind you,” Sias said with a devilish grin, “But it was thanks to him that I was able to calm down at least a bit. I even let myself have fun sometimes, if you can believe it!”

“No way, //the// Basil Àlex Bayside Sias allowing himself to have //fun//? Unbelievable!” Iglesias said, joyful sarcasm dripping from every word.

“It was just Basil Àlex Sias at the time, mind you,” Sias retorted, meeting her with a cheeky grin. The grin quickly faded, however, as he continued speaking. “My parents fought a lot. I don’t really remember the specifics of it all, but I remember them fighting more than anything else. Somehow the divorce was still a surprise, I guess for an eight year old it’s not the kind of thing that even registers on your radar.”

Sias sat up and leaned forward, resting his forehead against the palm of his right hand. He sat there, mouth slightly agape as if there was more he wanted to say. 

“Do you want to stop for now?” Iglesias finally asked.

“No, I’m just… trying to remember. God I was on a roll there, and next thing I know I’m at another wall. Sorry, just as I thought I was finally getting better I’m right back where I started.”

“No,” Iglesias said, shaking her head, “Today was the most progress you’ve made since we started. Let’s get you sleeping again, maybe we can knock some more thoughts loose.”

[[div class=&#34;outside&#34;]]

The stars were not the same.

The empty void that made up Sias&#39;s dreams hadn&#39;t changed. It remained as initially bleak and barren as it had been for Ixmucane before. With some waving of her arms the memories and dreams came forth, but it was a struggle. It felt almost as if something was pulling on them, attempting to hide them away somewhere unseen. Whatever it had been, it relinquished and the stars lined up as always. They weren&#39;t the same, however. Each memory felt like it had a layer of tarnish on it, shining with a dimmer light. Ixmucane took a step back, attempting to get a better view of the mind before her. 

&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; Iglesias&#39;s voice sounded in Ixmucane&#39;s head.

&#34;I am... not certain,&#34; she replied, slight hesitation in her voice, &#34;Something resisted me this time.&#34;

Ixmucane said nothing beyond that. Despite her questions, Iglesias remained silent. 

The fabric woman waved a hand over each flickering star, before finally selecting one. Placing her hand on it, the dreamscape came to life. Ixmucane found herself outdoors, in front of what appeared to be a sports arena of some kind. Before her stood four people. Despite each person being older than before, she was able to recognize each one. 

The first was Marc Sias, now roughly eighteen years old. He was impressively tall and slender, looking like a stiff breeze would blow him right over. His hair remained neatly trimmed as before, his hairstyle having remained unchanged over the past three years. In his hands he gripped four thin sheets of paper. 

Next was Wyatt, now around eleven years old. Wyatt had replaced the various bandages up and down his arms and legs with small scars, but nothing terribly deep. While taller, he was the shortest of the group. He had grown his hair out, as wavy blond locks hung just past his ears. 

Basil stood close to Wyatt, now the second tallest of the group. His hair was fairly close to Marc&#39;s, though clearly not as carefully kept as evidenced by a notable cowlick. He fidgeted in place, tracing circles in the dirt with his shoes. 

The last was Steven, who appeared to have changed the most over three years. His curly black hair had been pulled back into a haphazard bun, and he had ditched his glasses at some point. His freckles remained the same, however, thoroughly covering his face. Of the three younger boys, he appeared the most uncomfortable, mindlessly picking at his arm and fidgeting in place. 

&#34;Everyone feeling ok?&#34; Marc asked, casting a concerned look to the younger kids.

&#34;Yeah! We&#39;re just excited!&#34; Wyatt responded, his enthusiastic demeanor having remained the same over the years. He turned to his friends with a bright smile, now with a few more teeth than before. Basil responded with his own gentle smile, but Steven only flashed a halfhearted smirk. 

&#34;Come on!&#34; Wyatt continued, &#34;It&#39;s going to be fun! ...What band are we seeing again?&#34;

Marc&#39;s mouth moved, but the words that came out were little more than gibberish. Ixmucane held out an arm to pause the dream before rewinding it. No matter how many times she reran his response, however, she was unable to make out anything but nonsensical sputtering. 

&#34;Strange.&#34;

&#34;Are you going to elaborate or are we just being vague and mysterious again?&#34; Iglesias asked with a cheeky smirk. Ixmucane frowned, pursing her lips.

&#34;The memories we saw prior to this one were fairly clear overall. While they were framed in dreams, with the logic that comes with, this is less whole.&#34;

She looked around the landscape. It hadn&#39;t been immediately visible before, but small black holes dotted the landscape with no clear pattern. Turning her attention back to the human figures, she noticed the same. Small pocks of void dotting their bodies, holes in recollection. Even their faces seemed less defined than they had been in the earlier memories, with uncanny smooth features that seemed to flicker in and out of reality. 

&#34;Is that really so strange though? These memories are old, he&#39;s only... a preteen here, it looks like? It makes sense enough to me that things wouldn&#39;t be perfect,&#34; Iglesias said. Ixmucane firmly shook her head.

&#34;The memories prior were clear, almost perfect. There were few to no holes, despite them being from childhood. So why now?&#34;

Iglesias opened her mouth to speak again, but Ixmucane allowed the dream to continue. Whatever answers they were searching for weren&#39;t here yet. She sat in silence as the four figures marched towards the stadium with wobbling, uncertain motions. Eventually the dream melted away in a rain of colors, before manifesting once more. This time the scene was from within the stadium, each figure now standing in a crowd near a stage. The holes were more prominent here, with the largest taking up the stage itself. 

The sound of microphone feedback filled Iglesias&#39;s headset, followed by garbled static. Basil and the others responded fairly positively, with Wyatt jumping up and down in place and Steven raising his head with a cautiously optimistic smile. The static faded, replaced with a piercing guitar chord that tore through Iglesias&#39;s headphones. She threw them off her head in a panic, clasping her ears in pain.

The dream continued, Basil and the others beginning to jump and move with the crowd around them. Their movements were careful at first, but as it continued their motions became less stiff and uncomfortable. At some point Marc vanished into the crowd, but the boys didn&#39;t notice. They continued jumping and dancing in place, each with a wide grin on their face as they moved to the cacophony of guitars and vocalizations. As the noise continued, the crowd around the boys became more and more fluid. Faces and bodies began melting into each other, becoming a frothing sea of colors and facial features. Wyatt was the first to be swept away, followed by Steven. Basil was the last, swept into a raging sea of what was once people. 

Ixmucane had not been spared. She too found herself swept up, struggling against a tide of humanity and barely able to remain afloat. &#34;IGLESIAS!&#34; she screamed out as the seas continued to churn. Iglesias did not respond, hands still clasped over her ringing ears. 

As Ixmucane continued in her vain attempts to tread water, she saw Basil get pulled under. Without a second thought, she dove under after him. Under the tide was a seemingly endless swarm of human faces, each constantly shifting its features. She pushed them aside as she struggled towards Basil, who desperately tried to claw his way back to the surface. As she approached, she saw Steven in the undertow reaching his hand out to Basil. She grabbed his wrist, and together they swam towards Basil. She placed Steven&#39;s hand in his, and the seas seemed to calm if only a little. 

Basil opened his eyes, clearly still panicked. Ixmucane looked around for another potential solution, before spotting Wyatt who was also struggling to reach the surface. She swam over to him and grabbed his wrist before pushing through the crowd of nameless faces to reunite him with his friends. Basil&#39;s eyes went wide as he grabbed Wyatt&#39;s hand, firmer than he held Steven&#39;s. The seas calmed even further, but the group was still unable to reach the surface. 

Ixmucane scanned the fluid crowd for her final target. After a moment she spotted Marc, calling out to the boys with a gurgling voice. She guided him over, placing his hands on Basil&#39;s shoulders. The seas finally receded, leaving the group in a fairly empty field away from the stage and crowd. The younger boys huddled together, Basil and Steven sniffling as Marc did his best to not panic. 

&#34;I&#39;m //so// sorry guys, this all kinda went to sh- crap because of me,&#34; Marc said as he paced back and forth. 

&#34;It&#39;s ok, you didn&#39;t mean to,&#34; Wyatt said, as if trying to convince himself. Basil and Steven simply stood in silence. Marc shook his head. 

&#34;I appreciate that you&#39;re trying to be forgiving, Wyatt, I really do, but I messed up bad here. I&#39;m supposed to be the adult and I let you all down!&#34;

Marc threw his head to his hands, his voice growing shaky. He began to breathe more and more heavily. Basil broke away from the group and gingerly placed his hand on Marc&#39;s arm. Marc looked up from his spiral, tears glistening in the corners of his eyes, and met Basil&#39;s gaze.

&#34;You were there in the end,&#34; Basil said with a serious expression, &#34;That&#39;s all that matters.&#34;

Marc didn&#39;t respond, simply wrapping his little brother in a suffocating embrace. Basil struggled against it for a moment before giving in and reciprocating, a gentle smile forming on his face.

------

While Site-58 contained an on site cafeteria for personnel, it was rare that another person actually ate there. As a result it had become Iglesias&#39;s retreat away from work, one of the few places she could go to minimize human contact.

Why were people so exhausting?

She smirked to herself at the thought, the irony not lost on her. A Foundation therapist, tasked with making sure some of the most at risk people in the world were able to keep themselves together for the sake of the world, easily burnt out from //talking to people//. She shook her head, poking her fork at her pasta as she looked over Sias&#39;s documentation for the fifth or sixth time today.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Name:** Basil Àlex Bayside-Sias

[[/div]]

Iglesias stabbed down on a noodle firmly as she read. The inconsistency with how the Foundation handled hyphenated names always bothered her. 

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Clearance Level:** 3, with special clearance given on a per anomaly basis.

**Education:** High School Diploma

**History:** Hired by the Foundation Department of Anomalous Ambassadorship at Site-58 following the death of his father, former Agent Thyme Sias, in January of 2018. Due to a history of success with sapient anomalies, Agent Sias is considered a go-to for establishing and maintaining positive diplomatic relations between the Foundation and difficult anomalies. 

In 2024, following the transformation of [[[SCP-6103]]] and the containment of ████████████

[[/div]]

The redactions continued past that point. In fact a large portion of Sias&#39;s file had been redacted by someone in the O5 council, and none of Iglesias&#39;s requests for temporary clearance to view what was underneath were met with any response. The best she was able to do as a result was sit staring at the black boxes, as if an intense gaze would be enough to reveal what was underneath. 

&#34;Is this seat taken?&#34;

A light, feminine voice broke Iglesias&#39;s focus. She shook her head to bring herself back to reality, looking up to see who had decided to join her. She was met with a woman about ten years her senior, her meticulously painted face ever so slightly betrayed by light wrinkles across her brow and in the corners of her crimson lips. Her face was framed by light, bouncy blonde curls that helped contribute to her vaguely Marilyn Monroe aesthetic. 

&#34;Ah! No, sorry. You can sit here if you want to,&#34; Iglesias sputtered, gathering her papers and beginning to stand. The woman held up a hand to stop her, bracelets jangling against one another as she motioned for Iglesias to sit back down.

&#34;Come now, I just got here. The least you could do is humor me for a bit, Esperanza,&#34; the woman said, her voice warm, &#34;I&#39;m not here to get you in trouble or anything like that. Just chat with me for a minute.&#34;

Iglesias gulped and nodded, returning to her seat. 

&#34;Yes, of course Dr. Hopewell.&#34;

&#34;Esperanza, please. I know the cultural expectation to be formal and such, but I really would prefer if you just called me by my first name, especially if we&#39;re just having lunch.&#34;

&#34;Right, of course, Amy.&#34;

Dr. Amy Hopewell sighed and let out a chuckle. &#34;Now tell me what&#39;s bothering you so much, Esperanza. Is it that boy again?&#34;

&#34;No ma&#39;am!&#34; Iglesias retorted without a moment&#39;s hesitation. Hopewell smirked, before curling her lips into a frown as she cast her eyes towards the papers laid out before Iglesias.

&#34;It&#39;s about Basil then,&#34; she said, &#34;If I had known it was going to be this stressful I wouldn&#39;t have assigned him as your first patient. I&#39;m sorry for that, Esperanza, I knew he was struggling but I assumed that since he had been such an amicable man-&#34;

&#34;Please, Amy, don&#39;t worry about it. It isn&#39;t even Agent Sias that&#39;s bothering me... not him //specifically// anyway...&#34; her voice trailed off as she looked at the blackboxes once again. She looked back to Hopewell. &#34;I&#39;m enjoying working with Agent Sias, he&#39;s been a bit prickly but nothing I can&#39;t handle. It&#39;s just... Amy, you&#39;re the Assistant Director for Anomalous Ambassadorship. You know what&#39;s under these redactions, right?&#34;

&#34;Oh,&#34; Hopewell responded, sighing, &#34;I know a few details, yes, but nothing particularly helpful to you. Not even the Director himself knows, I&#39;m afraid.&#34; Hopewell leaned in towards Iglesias, her voice barely a whisper, &#34;You cannot tell a soul this, but as far as we know there are only two people who know what&#39;s under that redaction- Agent Sias himself, and a single member of O5.&#34;

&#34;Which member?&#34;

&#34;I can&#39;t tell you that,&#34; Hopewell said, shaking her head, &#34;largely because I don&#39;t actually know myself. The only thing I was allowed to know beyond that is that it involves an object contained on site somewhere.&#34;

Iglesias raised an eyebrow in confusion. While Site-58 was a large Foundation site with a myriad of personnel and contained anomalies, almost every anomaly on site was some kind of sapient, non-aggressive humanoid. It wasn&#39;t even particularly unusual for anomalies contained on site to be permitted to walk about non-restricted areas, a practice that had largely been discontinued at other Foundation sites. From what Iglesias knew about 58, the object with the highest level of security on it present at the site was Ixmucane herself, and that was only due to a breach caused by one of her coworkers. By all accounts, nothing at Site-58 warranted the importance implied by such heavy redacting

Iglesias sat with a furrowed brow, a finger curled over her lip in thought. Hopewell placed a hand on her shoulder to wake her up from her trance.

&#34;Sweetheart if you keep trying to wrack your brain over this you&#39;re going to accomplish little more than a headache. Your goal should be to do what you //can// to help Basil manage his issues, not what you //can&#39;t//. Focus on what is in your control to do, alright?&#34;

Iglesias gave a small nod. Hopewell responded with a warm smile.

&#34;If you need help let me know. It&#39;s only your first patient after all, you don&#39;t need to throw yourself at it alone.&#34;

Hopewell rose to her feet, clapping her hands together.

&#34;Well! That was a productive lunch! Thank you for your time, Esperanza. You know how to reach me! Toodles!&#34;

She strutted off, her heels clicking against the tile floor of the cafeteria. As she walked off, Iglesias couldn&#39;t help but notice that she had never even brought any food with her to begin with. 

------

&#34;Ixmucane, before we start can I ask you something?&#34;

Ixmucane&#39;s raised arms fell back to her side after hearing Iglesias&#39;s voice in her head. She sat, crossing her legs under her dress. 

&#34;Yes?&#34;

&#34;The memories... dreams... whatever they are, are there any that stand out as particularly weird to you when you summon them?&#34;

Ixmucane furrowed her brow, cocking her head to the side. &#34;How do you mean?&#34;

&#34;Like...&#34; Iglesias curled a finger over her lips in thought, resting her elbows on her desk, &#34;Well I&#39;m not really sure what it would look like, all these memory stars look the same to me. I guess anything that stands out as... secretive?&#34;

&#34;Secretive?&#34; Ixmucane repeated unconvinced. 

&#34;Something he&#39;s trying to hide, or something his mind wants to hide. Something that stands out as weird to you I suppose.&#34;

Ixmucane sighed, rising to her feet. She raised her arms out and began waving them. This time, however, she began moving her feet as well. Like a dance, she began to sway and step about the empty mindscape with lithe, free movements. As the dance continued, however, the movements became more strained and labored, as if weights had been tied to her body. The movements became increasingly sluggish until she collapsed onto her hands and knees.

Back in reality, Sias began thrashing in his sleep. With a fluid motion, Iglesias hit a button on her desk that further restrained him in place. After a few more moments of panicked thrashing, he settled back down. Iglesias turned her eyes back to her monitor, watching Ixmucane struggle to rise back to her feet.

&#34;What happened? Things got crazy on this end too!&#34;

&#34;There is something here,&#34; Ixmucane panted out a response, &#34;Something that does not wish to be brought to the surface.&#34;

&#34;Do you-&#34;

&#34;No, I do not know what it is. If I did I would not have called it &#39;something&#39;.&#34;

Iglesias sat in silence as Ixmucane finally returned to her feet. The fabric woman brushed herself off, a few stars of memory beginning to manifest about her. 

&#34;I do not know if it is Sias himself starting to resist, or something else entirely,&#34; Ixmucane continued, examining her surroundings, &#34;But does that answer your prior question?&#34;

Iglesias leaned back in her chair, throwing her head back. &#34;This sucks.&#34;

&#34;Indeed.&#34;

The bluntness of the delivery caught Iglesias off guard, and she found herself chuckling. 

&#34;What has you laughing?&#34;

&#34;Nothing, it&#39;s just... I didn&#39;t realize you had a sense of humor is all.&#34;

Ixmucane smirked. &#34;You have not talked with the Irishman I worked with then.&#34;

The smile vanished from Iglesias&#39;s face at the mention of the Irishman. She knew, of course, who Ixmucane was referring to. Dr. Ash Joydevor, formerly one of her research partners before she was hired as a site therapist. He had been [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6506 demoted] only a few months prior, and she was all too aware of why. The relevant documentation had been declassified to her only recently. 

Iglesias found herself drumming her desk with the tips of her fingers as she though about Ash, wondering how he was doing now and hoping he was well, while also wanting to beat him with a bat for what he did. Iglesias shivered, scratching at her arm and remembering how she felt as she read SCP-6506&#39;s documentation for the first time and seeing what Ash had done. It was deceitful! It was violating! It was...

...Exactly what she was doing with Agent Sias. 

She looked back to the other room. Agent Sias was laid out on his back, his arms and legs still restrained. His hair, no longer pulled back, framed his face like an unkempt lion&#39;s mane. His eyes were closed with some approximation of peace, but the heavy bags that circled them made the man appear more like a sickly hospital patient than someone simply taking a nap. 

Was this ok? Digging into someone&#39;s head? While Sias had consented to treatment, neither Iglesias nor the site director had ever specified exactly what the treatment was going to be. All Sias had been told was that it was &#34;dream therapy&#34;, something that seemed to bring a moment of concern across his face before he simply agreed, never asking for further details. Ixmucane&#39;s involvement had never been directly revealed to him, and even though Iglesias had accidentally revealed more information than she had intended in past sessions, Sias never seemed to question it. 

&#34;Iglesias?&#34;

Iglesias snapped out of her stupor in response to the voice. She turned back towards the monitor, noticing that no more stars were visible on screen. &#34;Yeah, sorry Ixmucane. What&#39;s wrong?&#34;

&#34;You were silent for several minutes. I was concerned something had happened.&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m fine, thank you. Where did all the memories go?&#34;

&#34;They were pulled back as I waited for instruction. I would have held onto them, but I do not believe that is wise. For Sias, or for yourself.&#34;

&#34;What do you mean?&#34;

&#34;Get some rest, Iglesias,&#34; Ixmucane said, concern creeping into her voice, &#34;I know the human mind. You are tired, and so is Sias. Each of you needs a break, if only a small one.&#34;

Iglesias attempted to protest, but was unable to find the words. With a sigh, she thanked Ixmucane for her time and shut the session down.

------

In spite of Ixmucane&#39;s advice, Iglesias found herself staring at her monitor late into the night, absentmindedly fiddling with SCP-6506 in one hand while she tapped away at her keyboard with the other. Technically speaking it was against the containment procedures for her to still have the small doll in her possession. 6506 was a lower priority anomaly in the grander scheme of things, and as a result Iglesias sneaking her out for a bit longer than officially cleared was generally seen as harmless. 

She stared down at the doll&#39;s cloth face and into its empty string eyes. 

&#34;Really wish we could just talk outside of someone else&#39;s dream, Ix. I could really use some help here.&#34;

Iglesias rolled her chair back, stretching her arms over her head in a dramatic display. She propped the small doll up on her keyboard before crossing her arms over the desk and dropping her chin down on them. 

&#34;You&#39;ve been in my head before, right? That&#39;s what the document says anyway. I never really got the chance to thank you for that.&#34;

Iglesias gently tapped the bundle of yarn atop 6506&#39;s head with a finger.

&#34;So thanks, I guess. Thanks to you... and Ash, I mean. Ash too.&#34;

She buried her face in her arms.

&#34;My case was so //easy// though, wasn&#39;t it? Just a matter of making me apologize for the shitty thing I did. This though? I mean I //know// what the issue is, clinically and practically. I just...&#34;

Iglesias rolled her head up to face the doll once more.

&#34;God why am I doing this? I don&#39;t even have myself figured out yet, how am I supposed to be helping other people worse off than I am?&#34;
