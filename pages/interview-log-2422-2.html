&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-2422-C
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Welsch
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Dr. Welsch made a request to have a followup interview with SCP-2422-C to ensure the amended containment procedures – including the administration of antidepressants to SCP-2422-C without its knowledge – was effective. Her request was approved, but the interview conducted produced no pertinent information. However, SCP-2422-C subsequently requested regular meetings with Dr. Welsch, as a sort of therapy. These sessions are recorded for the purposes of record-keeping. They almost universally contain no information of interest. On 3/██/20██, however, SCP-2422-C revealed new information concerning the nature of SCP-2422. Irrelevant data has been removed from the following log [http://www.scp-wiki.net/re-promotion but retained in Project Director records] (Level-4/2422 Clearance required).
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Welsch:** Hello, SCP-2422-C. How have you been this week?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2422-C:** Okay, I guess. How have you been?
&gt; 
&gt; [IRRELEVANT DATA EXPUNGED]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Welsch:** I am certainly glad you’ve been feeling better. Do you have any idea why–
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2422-C:** No, you’re not.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Welsch:** I’m sorry?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2422-C:** Why are you so nervous?
&gt; 
&gt; //[Dr. Welsch pauses]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Welsch:** Crap.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2422-C:** If you’re going to lie to me, don’t look me in the eyes. I know you have mom put stuff in my food.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Welsch:** They’re standard commercial antidepressants. They’re for your own good.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2422-C:** Just like everything else here, right?
&gt; 
&gt; [IRRELEVANT DATA EXPUNGED]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Welsch:** Well, your family certainly seems satisfied with their lifestyle.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2422-C:** Do you really think that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Welsch:** Well, they haven’t given us any indication otherwise.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2422-C:** We’re programmed not to.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Welsch:** By Wandering Father?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2422-C:** Yes, by him.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Welsch:** Then why are you so unhappy? Aren’t you fulfilling your purpose?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2422-C:** None of us asked for this. We were made to make people happy, but none of us //want// to, really. Wandering Father gave us a purpose, and then he gave us about three-quarters of a free will. We feel compelled to make others happy, but we don’t enjoy it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Welsch:** But why don’t you enjoy making others happy? Do you not enjoy being kind?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2422-C:** Not when we have no choice.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Both pause]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2422-C:** Look, you have to see what we do when no one’s around. I know you have cameras in our rooms.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Welsch:** We haven’t noticed anything unusual.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2422-C:** You haven’t seen my parents after they go to bed?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Welsch:** They have a habit of concealing themselves entirely by their covers. We’ve figured it’s best to allow them a small measure of privacy.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2422-C:** Oh my God, you think they’re having //sex?//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Welsch:** Well, we assumed–
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2422-C:** I guarantee you neither of them have had sex in their lives. They hide themselves because they don’t want you to see them crying.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Both pause]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Welsch:** You mean they–
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2422-C:** They don’t like it any more than I do. They just care more about hiding it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Welsch:** 2422-C, I’m–
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2422-C:** You’re sorry. I know. Frankly, it’s not good enough.
&gt; 
&gt; [IRRELEVANT DATA EXPUNGED]
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Following this interview, Dr. Welsch went on a two-week leave for mental heath purposes.
