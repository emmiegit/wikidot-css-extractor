**Item #:** SCP-4081

**Object Class:** Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4081-1 is currently located at the Brighton Sports Gymnasium. No SCP-4081 events have occurred since 2/13/18. Surveillance of Brighton High School is no longer permitted at this time. The following Special Containment Procedures are no longer valid, but have been archived on this document for historical reference.

[[collapsible show=&#34; + Open Original Containment Procedures&#34; hide=&#34; - Close Original Containment Procedures&#34;]]

Foundation personnel are to be stationed at both entrances to SCP-4081-1 during school hours in order to discourage civilians from participating in SCP-4081 events. If an SCP-4081 event occurs to a civilian, they are to be administered a Class-A amnestic following its conclusion.

Instances of SCP-4081-2 are to be taken down as soon as possible after their initial discovery. All SCP-4081-2 instances are to be stored in a standard storage locker at Site-48.

In the event that SCP-4081 events cease to occur, standard surveillance of Brighton High School is to be initialized. When SCP-4081 events begin to occur, Site-48 is to be notified, and the above Special Containment Procedures are to be implemented.

[[/collapsible]]

**Description:** SCP-4081 is an anomalous spacial event that may occur to an individual entering SCP-4081-1, a hallway located within the Brighton Sports Gymnasium in Positano, California. SCP-4081-1 runs longitudinally along the length of the gymnasium for one hundred meters. SCP-4081-1 contains doors at its east and west endpoints, as well as side doors connecting to adjacent rooms. 

The following three criteria must be met for an SCP-4081 event to initialize:

* The individual must enter SCP-4081-1 through the doors at either endpoint[[footnote]] Entering SCP-4081-1 through a side door will not trigger an SCP-4081 event. [[/footnote]].
* The individual must be alone when entering SCP-4081-1.
* The individual has not participated in an SCP-4081 event at any prior point.

When an SCP-4081 event starts, a white light will illuminate underneath the doors at the other endpoint of SCP-4081-1. The doors the affected individual entered will be locked, and no other doors will be accessible. To complete an SCP-4081 event, the affected person must walk down SCP-4081-1 to the other end and exit through the glowing doors. The affected individual will not be visible to any other persons looking into SCP-4081-1.

After the completion of an SCP-4081 event, the individual will find themselves exiting out the doors originally used to access SCP-4081-1, rather than the other end. Individuals cannot participate in a successful SCP-4081 event more than once.

SCP-4081-2 is the designation for a series of notes referencing the SCP-4081 phenomenon. All known SCP-4081-2 instances have been printed on flexible off-white paper with a slightly soft texture, and contain the same typeface. The message printed on these instances will vary based on the context of their discovery. SCP-4081-2 instances will manifest instantly, and if affixed to a wall, will be taped on with translucent office tape of unknown brand.
------
**Discovery:** On 2/5/2018, the Foundation was notified of the existence of SCP-4081 through routine social media surveillance. Instances of SCP-4081-2 were discovered taped to surfaces within heavily trafficked areas of Brighton High School. All instances described the process required to initialize SCP-4081 events. Foundation operatives removed all known SCP-4081-2 instances, and coerced the Brighton faculty to release a statement referring to the messages as pranks. Study of SCP-4081 began on 2/7/2018.

The following is the first known variant of SCP-4081-2.

= Hello Brighton students:

= Do you want to help keep our school running smoothly?

= If so, we are hosting auditions in the Sports Gym. There is no need to schedule an appointment. You can come in at any time, any date.

= To audition, you must enter from either end of the hallway in the Sports Gym. You must walk directly to the opposite end, and enter through the glowing white doors. No one else can come with you.

= We look forward to watching your auditions, and wish you all the best of luck.

**Testing Logs:** The following is an incomplete list of experiments regarding SCP-4081 events.

[[collapsible show=&#34; + Show Testing Logs&#34; hide=&#34; - Hide Testing Logs&#34;]]

&gt; **Test 4081-01**
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** Brighton student Connor ████████
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedure:** The subject entered SCP-4081-1 with the intention of &#34;auditioning&#34;. This test was performed unintentionally.
&gt; 
&gt; **Result:** Subject exited SCP-4081-1 through the doors he originally entered. When interrogated by Foundation personnel, the subject stated that he did not turn around within SCP-4081-1 at any point. An instance of SCP-4081-2 was discovered in his pocket with the following message:
&gt; [[div style=&#34;display: inline-block; border:solid 1px #999999; background:#fffff0; float:center; width:60%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px&#34;]]
&gt; = To Connor,
&gt; 
&gt; = Your audition is complete.
&gt; 
&gt; = Thank you for your participation.
&gt; 
&gt; = //- Keep Brighton Functioning Committee//
&gt; [[/div]]
&gt; 
&gt; The subject was administered Class-A amnestics and released. The Special Containment Procedures have been updated to prevent civilian participation in SCP-4081 events.

&gt; **Test 4081-02**
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** D-3763
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedure:** Subject was equipped with a GPS tracker, and instructed to enter SCP-4081-1 and exit the other side. Subject was not aware of the existence of SCP-4081 events.
&gt; 
&gt; **Result:** When D-3763 entered SCP-4081-1, her location disappeared from Foundation GPS tracking. D-3763 exited SCP-4081-1 out its other end with an instance of SCP-4081-2 in her pocket. The instance reads:
&gt; [[div style=&#34;display: inline-block; border:solid 1px #999999; background:#fffff0; float:center; width:60%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px&#34;]]

&gt; **Test 4081-03**
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** D-3763
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedure:** Subject was instructed to participate in an SCP-4081 event again. Subject was not equipped with any tracking devices.
&gt; 
&gt; **Result:** D-3763 exited the doors she entered. She expressed disbelief, and explained that she did not reverse her traversal of SCP-4081-1 at any point. An instance of SCP-4081-2 was discovered in D-3763&#39;s pocket, and reads:
&gt; [[div style=&#34;display: inline-block; border:solid 1px #999999; background:#fffff0; float:center; width:60%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px&#34;]]

&gt; **Test 4081-07**
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** Researcher Shaun Xiao
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedure:** Subject was instructed to vocalize questions regarding SCP-4081 events while within SCP-4081-1. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Result:** Researcher Xiao exited out the entrance of SCP-4081-1 after 35 minutes. He expressed that he asked about the purpose of SCP-4081, and the identities of the entities responsible. No responses were heard. An instance of SCP-4081-2 was found in his lab coat:

&gt; [[/div]]

&gt; **Test 4081-08**
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** D-6772
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedure:** Subject was instructed to walk from one end of SCP-4081-1 to the other.
&gt; 
&gt; **Result:** D-6772 exited SCP-4081 through the doors he entered 1 hour and 44 minutes after his original entrance. When inquired about the time difference, D-6772 expressed that he only spent two minutes within SCP-4081-1. An instance of SCP-4081-2 was recovered:
&gt; [[div style=&#34;display: inline-block; border:solid 1px #999999; background:#fffff0; float:center; width:60%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px&#34;]]

&gt; = //- Keep Brighton Functioning Committee//
&gt; [[/div]]

&gt; **Test 4081-14**
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** D-8358
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedure:** Subject was instructed to walk from one end of SCP-4081-1 to the other.
&gt; 
&gt; **Result:** D-8358 did not exit SCP-4081-1, and could not be recovered. An instance of SCP-4081-2 manifested in front of waiting Foundation researchers, which read as follows:
&gt; [[div style=&#34;display: inline-block; border:solid 1px #999999; background:#fffff0; float:center; width:60%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px&#34;]]
&gt; = Dear Brighton students:
&gt; 
&gt; = Due to unexpected interference, we have cancelled our search until further notice.

Following Test 4081-14, no more SCP-4081 events have occurred within SCP-4081-1 despite multiple initiation attempts. SCP-4081 has been reclassified as Neutralized on 2/27/2018.

------
**Addendum 01:** On 3/4/2018, instances of SCP-4081-2 appeared within Brighton High School, affixed to surfaces in large numbers with industrial glue. All instances contained the same message revealing the existence of the Foundation to civilians. Mobile Task Force Kappa-28 (&#34;School&#39;s Out&#34;) was dispatched to destroy all SCP-4081-2 instances. 

The SCP-4081-2 variant involved is transcribed below.

On 3/9/2018, Brighton High School was reopened with the SCP-4081-2 instances still present. All removed surfaces were returned and re-installed with the SCP-4081-2 instances affixed. Researcher Xiao made a public apology on behalf of the Foundation within SCP-4081-1 addressed to the &#34;Keep Brighton Functioning Committee&#34;. No response was heard. Surveillance of Brighton High School was ceased in its entirety.

Site-48 was put on lockdown as a precaution, and all personnel were moved to classified locations. 
------
**Addendum 04:** On 3/14/2018, the corpse of D-8358 spontaneously manifested within the safe room of Site Director Lutz at 7:14 AM. The corpse was missing its skin. An instance of SCP-4081-2 was taped to its forehead.

Following this event, all stored instances of SCP-4081-2 revealing personnel information have had their messages erased through unknown means, leaving blank notes. All known SCP-4081-2 instances located within Brighton High School have vanished. Site-48 was reopened, and all relocated personnel were cleared to return to their residences.

Close analysis of SCP-4081-2 instances reveal them to be partially constructed out of processed human skin. All recovered instances are an exact DNA match of D-8358, including instances manifested before his disappearance.
