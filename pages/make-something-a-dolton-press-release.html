++ Skyline Design Inc. Spells The Start Of Karl Golàn&#39;s 23rd-Century Dreams
[[size 105%]]
//Architect Karl Golàn[[footnote]]Oh yeah, definitely a sketchy scheme. No reasonable artist has an accent on the second syllable in their name.[[/footnote]] Agrees to Work with Skyline Design Inc.[[footnote]]New company?[[/footnote]] on their Newest Project, the Contented City//
[[/size]]
[[/=]]
**Etruscan Town, Dolton:** On April 1st, 2202[[footnote]]Possibly a fish?[[/footnote]], Karl Golàn, master stone architect of the century, was contracted by Skyline Design Inc. to incorporate his unique style into their new city projects for the next two years. Skyline Design is a city planning and building design firm with the intentions of creating a more physically appealing urban environment for those living in the rolling hills of Dolton[[footnote]]Impossible. How are you even going to build anything when the people won&#39;t even look up and smile?[[/footnote]]. Enlisting Karl Golàn into the ranks of their design team is a major step in realizing this mission, and his first job is to use his skill to create the Contented City, a city that will specialize in buildings designed to increase happiness and reduce idleness rates for all citizens[[footnote]]There has to be magic involved here!.[[/footnote]]. Because Skyline Design Inc. recognizes that this would prove instrumental in reviving some of Dolton, the Super-Mayor Boss of SDI is increasing gains and potential citizen benefits for all stakeholders that support this project[[footnote]]Maybe I can grab a few stocks while I&#39;m investigating.[[/footnote]].

Alan Mallard, SMB of Skyline Design Inc, commented on the same day of Golàn&#39;s contracting and the announcement of potential benefits: &#34;Nothing gets done without innovation. The past hundred years or so of Dolton&#39;s falling economy and happiness is indicative of that—and it&#39;s time to change. After the resounding accomplishments we&#39;ve made within our now-lovely Etruscan Town, I think it&#39;s also about time to recruit more and more local-but-unexplored talents such as Karl Golàn and spread our holdings into other quadrants of Dolton...For starters, we&#39;ll be constructing a new town from scratch to bridge the economies of Alcove Grounds and Deathville in Quadrant Why...I only see bright things ahead of us, and for everyone else as well!&#34;[[footnote]]I can&#39;t confirm nor deny this information even though I was there at the time, and I swear it&#39;s not because my attention span was affected by that goldfish magician in Oltonia.[[/footnote]]

Recruiting Karl Golàn, a new talent from the Baking Suburbs[[footnote]]Recently purged by the Deathshroom infestation. I wonder if that has anything to do with his recruitment?[[/footnote]], along with other less expressive aspiring architects[[footnote]]See Axel Capri, Welya Lynch, both acknowledged architects[[/footnote]], was no easy task. This is because of the lack of support for the visual arts in Dolton[[footnote]]An understatement.[[/footnote]], and so the company acted accordingly:
* Several posters with fascinating designs[[footnote]]Fish Pornography?[[/footnote]] to draw in artists were distributed throughout the towns in Dolton that were designated as &#34;the top 20 towns that are not likely to become colorblind in the next century&#34; by Color Bounce Newspaper[[footnote]]Recently accused of unfair judgement. Makes sense, the boss is named Renny Colène.[[/footnote]]. These towns supposedly had a higher collective portfolio of art over time. Said posters included information on a job opening for designers, and when and where to contact recruiting officers[[footnote]]I&#39;ll have to grab my trash can suit and go on a stake-out for suspicious activity.[[/footnote]].

* Artists traveling[[footnote]]Doltons usually use a double &#34;L&#34;...[[/footnote]] from their hometowns in order to work in Etruscan Town with the rest of the firm also receive compensation: Hired designers have their own personal studio that they share with one other artist that specializes in a similar style. They also have free access to professional mental health[[footnote]]Them and what professionals? Never heard of a Doltonian psychologist. Look into illicit immigration/kidnapping.[[/footnote]], a new thing for Dolton companies.

**About Skyline Design Inc:** Originally a cemetery planning organization, Skyline Design Inc. evolved from a small construction studio in Etruscan Town, Dolton, where it is now situated. Face-lifted in 2195, over 500 employees are contracted by SDI, making it one of the largest companies in the nation. SDI currently designs architectural structures and large-scale projects for various towns across Dolton, and has helped over 20 towns and businesses so far[[footnote]]Never heard of them![[/footnote]].
