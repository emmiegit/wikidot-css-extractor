I&#39;ve included a transcription of the manual for anyone to read. I actually still have my copy from back when it was originally released -- and they&#39;re going for upwards of $500 in pristine condition so I took a huge risk by scanning the manual for y&#39;all. The game&#39;s interesting and I remember never being able to beat it when I was young though. There&#39;s a rumor going around it&#39;s actually based on hidden classified FBI files, but that&#39;s fucking stupid because if it was, then they wouldn&#39;t have been able to make it in the first place. I also uploaded a version with images, which you can find [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/aberrant-factor-manual/offset/0 here].

Anyways, I delivered the request. Have fun with it and I hope you enjoy.

**CASE:** __Twilight Grove Serial Kidnapping__
**FILE #: 83-2934**

**##red|[ ASSIGNED TO: AGENT KEOHANE ]##**

**FOR REVIEW**
Over the last few months, a series of disappearances (presumed kidnappings) have occurred in and around the town of Twilight Grove. These disappearances have coincided with an increase of tourists visiting neighboring resort towns.

The reason for the current designation of this case as a serial kidnapping revolves around the shared M.O. All kidnappings have occurred in the early hours of the morning (0300 - 0600) on days with new moons; additionally, all of the victims were last seen near local bodies of water. Most so far have been young children. 

No potential suspects have been identified nor have there been any eyewitnesses to any of the disappearances. Several sweeps of the surrounding area have also turned up empty. Local authorities have deferred to us on this case.

RE: Assignment 85-2934

Chief --
I don&#39;t think this one is in our jurisdiction. The last similar case ended up being a waste of time and resources. Strandt seems to have a vested interest, so I&#39;ll let her handle it. Hope nothing goes wrong....

+ STARTING THE GAME
[[/=]]
-----
The title screen will fade-in after the game has been loaded.

__**NEW GAME**__
Clicking on ‘New Game’ will start a new playthrough of the story. Note that if you get into gameplay from here, it will override any previous autosaves you have!

__**CONTINUE (AUTO) or (MANUAL)**__
On selection, the game will automatically load the topmost manual save (see the Save system on pg. #). If you don’t have one, it will load the save in the autosave slot. If you have neither, then this selection will not appear in the menu.

__**LOAD CASEFILE**__
The “Load Casefile” option will bring up the Save system, where you can load any saves that you have created.

+ SAVING
[[/=]]
-----
The SAVES submenu can be accessed by clicking on the corresponding option in the display menu, title screen, or game over screen. Saving and loading can be done anytime in the game.

__**SAVING**__
Selecting ‘Save’ next to an open slot number will save your progress into that slot.  There is an eight save slot limit in the game, so be careful! ‘Save to Disk’ will save your progress as a .save file to a selected folder (defaulted to your Downloads folder) on your computer. Saves can be overwritten by deleting the save in the slot you wish to overwrite, and then saving again to that slot.

Clicking on ‘Continue (MANUAL)’ in the main menu will load the top-most saved slot, i.e. starting at slot no. 1, so it is best to keep that slot as your recent save. The game will automatically save to the autosave slot at specified points.

##red|**NOTE:**## It is highly recommended to save at the start of new pages and sequences. Due to how the engine works any choices made will NOT be saved if you create a save mid-passage. Upon loading, the game will assume that you have just newly landed on the page you previously left off on.

[[/=]]

__**LOADING**__
If a save slot has been used, the ‘Save’ button next to the slot will be replaced by ‘Load’; selecting this will load the game in that slot automatically. Alternatively, the ‘Load from Disk’ option can be used to load any .save files you have downloaded to your computer. Any downloaded .save files from other games or previous versions of the game will either fail to load or cause significant errors while attempting gameplay.

__**DELETION**__
To remove a used save slot, the ‘Delete’ button will be able to be selected. Pressing this button will only delete the save in the specific slot. The ‘Delete All’ option can be used to remove all save slots (including the autosave slot). Only do this if you are sure this is what you want, because there is no extra confirmation button!

+ DISPLAY MENU
[[/=]]
-----
The display menu is opened by clicking the triangle at the top-left corner of the game anytime after the opening. Watch out! This does not pause the game. All player information can be found here: STATUS, INVENTORY, FILE, and MAP.

__**STATUS**__
Will show Agent Keohane’s “life pulse”. This will range from healthy (green) to dying (red) and will be bloody when death is imminent. His current health is also accompanied by condition text.

Depending on your choices in-game, Keohane can get killed, which leads to a game over. Play smart and don’t be rash!

__**INVENTORY**__
Any picked-up items will appear in the inventory with an icon and a short description of the item. For certain items or for loaded firearms, the description will also include the number of uses or bullets left in the item/firearm. Items with no further application will be automatically discarded from the inventory upon final use.

__**MAP**__
Displays the floor plan of the current location. The room Keohane is in will be marked in red and the name of the room will be displayed in the heading. All map headings will retain the naming format of ‘Location Name [Floor #] -- Room Name’.

Green areas represent currently-accessible areas, while yellow rectangles represent traversable doors. Presently inaccessible areas and locked doors will be marked with dark blue.

+ SPECIAL INTERACTION
[[/=]]
-----
Several points in the game will require alternate interaction modes than standard gameplay.

__**DIALOGUE**__
Dialogue scenes will have all text fade-in on intervals as if a conversation or event was occurring. Once all text has been displayed, one or more options will be presented as either dialogue responses or actions to be taken. Some scenes are designed to let you explore every option. Others are designed to be more linear -- like a cutscene. Special scenes are timed, so you may want to read fast!

Once these scenes are over, either Keohane or another character will close out the conversation or perform one last action before automatically moving to the next page.

__**PUZZLES**__
The combination lock puzzle requires you to click on the individual numbers in the lock, which will index by one on every press. Once you believe you have entered the correct code, select the ‘Try to unlock?’ prompt. The game will then inform you if you unlocked it or if you have entered the wrong combination.

A combo lock combination may be &#34;0 0 4 5 1&#34;.

The password access puzzle requires you to click into the textbox and enter the correct password using your keyboard. After the password is entered, hit ‘Submit’ to attempt to log-in. If it is correct, the button will change to a ‘Login’ button which will take you to the next page. 

HINT: If you believe you’ve entered the correct password but the attempts keep failing, make sure you’re entering the right password for the right username!

A strong, fixed-blade knife that can be used in emergencies for self-defense or as a utility tool.

##red|**COLT PYTHON**##
Your personal sidearm, a venerable revolver that fires .357 Magnum. It’s accurate and powerful. Holds six rounds in the chamber. Ammo is a little harder to come by.

##red|**SIG-SAUER P229**##
One of the standard sidearms of the FBIUIU. Your partner Strandt carries one. Reliable shooter that fires as fast as you can pull the trigger. Holds fifteen rounds.
