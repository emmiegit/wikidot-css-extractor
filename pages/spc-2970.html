++ NOTICE FROM THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE COORDINATION AND PROJECTS OPERATION COMMAND OFFICE
 
All Arenas that are using SPC-2970 are to enact Procedure &#34;SUCKER PUNCH&#34; and dispose of the bodies. By following CICOAPOCO standards, SPC-2970 is to be considered ##Red | Deactivated## until further notice.

Search, Punch, Conquer.

**Selachian Pugnātorial Capabilities:** The SPC-2970 project is to combat rising selachian numbers and their sympathisers. The Centre is to use SPC-2970-B entities for Shock and Awe operations.

These operations are to include raids on sympathiser stations handing out selachian propaganda. Common locations for stations are outside supermarkets, the sea life preservation centres in major towns and cities, and within television documentaries that promote donating to the selachian cause.

SPC-2970-B instances are to also mobilise with Marine Fighting Teams (MFT) in the field to assist in capturing/punching sharks and combating Groups to Punch operatives, whose goals are to see the destruction of the Centre.

**Project Component(s):** SPC-2970 is a human cloning program, brought to the Centre by Doctor Rosa Miles. SPC-2970 has two sub-designations: SPC-2970-A and SPC-2970-B.

SPC-2970-A is a cybernetically enhanced human of unknown descent. Dr Rosa Miles brought SPC-2970-A to the Centre when the scientific Group to Punch known as &#34;Prometheus Labs&#34; disbanded. Following CICOAPOCO regulations, SPC-2970-A must be placed in stasis to preserve its genetic makeup for future SPC-2970-B entities.

SPC-2970-B consists of two components. The first component is the embryo production. DNA harvested from SPC-2970-A is to be inserted into adult cells gathered from Centre agents which have been chosen by lead researchers of SPC-2970.[[footnote]] This extraction process can range from taking an agent&#39;s coffee cup to directly taking blood from the agent&#39;s &#34;monthly checkup&#34;. [[/footnote]]  Any SPC-2970 embryos not meeting up to standard procedures are to be terminated and flushed from the growth vats to begin preparations for next batch.

Once SPC-2970-B entities have reached adulthood, they must enter the Operating room to receive augmentations based on their purposes. Common augmentations include but are not limited to:
* Arm-mounted non-lethal harpoon guns to replace a forearm. [[footnote]]We&#39;re here to punch selachian entities. Not &#39;poon them. Anyone who thinks we should &#39;poon them, please send your complaint to the nearest coach and go fuck yourself! ~ //Chief Puncher Jacobs//[[/footnote]]
* Water jets installed into the body to allow for faster movement.
* Rebreathers installed into the throat for SPC-2970 to breathe underwater.
* Rocket powered detachable fists. [[footnote]]Because rocket punches are freaking awesome. ~ //Engineer Mason//[[/footnote]]
* Memory units, to back up to the servers when deceased SPC-2970-B instances are recovered.

**Augmentation Summary:** Doctor Rosa Miles arrived at Arena-17 in the 80s, claiming to be a researcher of a collapsed Prometheus Labs from an alternate reality. She brought SPC-2970-A from her universe. The Centre has allowed Doctor Rosa Miles to remain in our universe, on the grounds that the template is used for combating the selachian threat.

The first SPC-2970-B entities were clones of SPC-2970-A. The SPC-2970-B entities&#39; DNA is 100% identical with SPC-2970&#39;s, which was considered a success. Arena-17 thus began secondary testing - Modifying SPC-2970-B with augmentations.

SPC-2970-B showed remarkably little resistance to accepting the augmentations. However, SPC-2970-B also showed little interest in fighting for the Centre&#39;s cause. Multiple instances would be discovered participating in non-Centre activities. For example: SPC-2970-B, instance 13, was occupying itself with playing computer games which featured neither punching selachians or advancing the Centre&#39;s goals.

Arena-17 proposed infusing SPC-2970-B instances with DNA of high-ranking Punchers. Doctor Rosa Miles displayed hostility towards the Centre for proposing such an action and was removed from all tests during this phase. SPC-2970-B&#39;s DNA accepted these changes with no issues and have shown incredible aggression towards Selachian entities.

Afterwards, SPC-2970-B entities were produced and sent to MFT in need of reinforcements and/or extra hands for on-going Centre Projects.

**Deployment Record:** Since deployment, SPC-2970-B was used across the frontlines during the Third Sharkic War. They were effective in fighting the Sharkics during Operation &#34;DEEP DIVE&#34;. 

||~ Statistics ||~ Centre ||~ Sharkic Cult no.13[[footnote]] We didn&#39;t bother learning their name but we think it has something to do with Selachians.[[/footnote]] ||
||~ Total numbers of forces || **Humans:** 123 **SPC-2970-B instances:** 5 || **Humans:** 80 **selachian entities:** 35 ||
||~ Total losses || **Humans:** 48, **SPC-2970-B:** 2 || **Humans:** 65, **selachian entities** 35 (17 captured) ||
||~ Recovered equipment || N/A || 1 copy of the Sharkic bible thing[[footnote]] Unfortunatly we cannot type out its name, as it has been recorded to be destructive whenever seen.[[/footnote]](Destroyed), 17 shark craft books, 5 arcane relics (destroyed after analysis) ||

SPC-2970-B instances also took down several sympathiser stations that were handing out propaganda pamphlets and collecting donations for the Selachian cause. For example: SPC-2970-B instance 37, destroyed the Selachian&#39;s Hand recruitment station outside Wal-Mart in Florida and brought in the sympathisers for interrogation. Operation &#34;BROKEN ANCHOR&#34; was then devised soon after.

According to Operation &#34;BROKEN ANCHOR&#34;, however, SPC-2970-B started to show abnormal behaviour. Below is the recorded transcript of MFT POSEIDON&#39;S BOX during Operation &#34;BROKEN ANCHOR&#34;.

&gt; **Date:** ██/██/████
&gt; 
&gt; **Team Leader:** Skipper
&gt; 
&gt; **Team Members:** Sarah, Michael, Donald, SPC-2970-B (instance 37)
&gt; 
&gt; **//Foreword://** This was recorded during the SPC underwater assault on the GoP &#34;Selachian&#39;s Hand&#34;. The recording was recovered from the sole survivor of BROKEN ANCHOR, Michael.

&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; **Skipper:** Holy- Get down!
&gt; 
&gt; (//Sounds of explosions can be heard close to Michael.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Donald:** Get your head in the game, rookie! We got ourselves a wizard selachian entity! Don&#39;t wanna be caught by them, do you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Michael:** Sorry! This is very surreal for me!
&gt; 
&gt; **Skipper:** Whatever, just be sure to throw the anchor[[footnote]] The Anchor is a grenade in the shape of an anchor that disables selachians using thaumaturgy. Effectively stopping them from doing &#34;magic&#34;. [[/footnote]] if they get too close!
&gt; 
&gt; **Michael:** Yes, sir!
&gt; 
&gt; **Sarah:** Status update on SPC-2970-B. It appears that our dear friend has purged quite a number by himself. I can see the corpses of selachian and sympathisers alike. (//Chuckles to herself for five seconds before sounds of purging can be heard.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Skipper:** Sounds like a lot of fun over there, we&#39;re just two kilks out. Be sure to save me one when we get there.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sarah:** No promises, Capt-
&gt; 
&gt; **Skipper:** Sarah? Sarah, you there?
&gt; 
&gt; (//Silence over the radio.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Donald:** Perhaps the Hand has deployed a jammer to stop us from talking.
&gt; 
&gt; **Michael:** Shouldn&#39;t we go and save her?
&gt; 
&gt; **Skipper:** She&#39;s a grown up and a Puncher. She&#39;ll be fine. We continue on.
&gt; 
&gt; (//Most of the log has been cut for brevity&#39;s sake. Log continues as the team reaches the interior of the// Wanderer&#39;s Pool.)
&gt; 
&gt; **Skipper:** Hang on, team.
&gt; 
&gt; **Donald:** Chief, what is it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Skipper:** Got a ping up ahead. It appears to be... Sarah!
&gt; 
&gt; **Michael:** Hang on, wasn&#39;t she with -B? Where&#39;s its ping?
&gt; 
&gt; **Donald:** It&#39;s a Puncher, just like us! Perhaps it&#39;s going undercover and turned off his transmitter to ensure we don&#39;t blab if we get caught. Who cares? We can always make more of him. Let me make contact with Sarah.
&gt; 
&gt; **Donald:** (//Shouting//) Sarah, my dude! Where have you been?
&gt; 
&gt; (//SPC-2970-B appeared from the corridor where Sarah&#39;s transmitter was coming from.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **SPC-2970-B:** Sorry, team. Our brave Sarah is busy with the fishes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Donald:** That&#39;s our Sarah, punching those stupid Selachian things in their stupid noses!
&gt; 
&gt; **Skipper:** You okay, -B? You don&#39;t seem to be as energetic as us.
&gt; 
&gt; **SPC-2970-B:** Oh... Yeah, I&#39;m fine. Agent Sarah has the path nearly done, so we can go on ahead, yeah?
&gt; 
&gt; **Donald:** Dude, that sounds good enough to me. Lets go punch us some wizard sympathisers!
&gt; 
&gt; (//Once more, the majority of this log has been cut for brevity&#39;s sake. Resuming as the team breaches the main chamber and begins their assault.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Skipper:** Come on, POSEIDON&#39;S BOX! Give them a good fisting!
&gt; 
&gt; **Donald:** Phrasing, BOOM! (//Laughs as Donald throws a punch at the nearest SH member.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Skipper:** Where&#39;s -B? I ain&#39;t seeing rocket punches!
&gt; 
&gt; (//Michael swims close to SPC-2970-B, who can be seen punching a selachian with less energy than the other MFT members.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Michael:** Hey, buddy? You okay?
&gt; 
&gt; **SPC-2970-B:** It&#39;s... complicated, Mike.
&gt; 
&gt; **Michael:** C&#39;mon man. We&#39;re on the same team, aren&#39;t we? You can tell me.
&gt; 
&gt; **SPC-2970-B:** You wouldn&#39;t understand.
&gt; 
&gt; (//The rest of POSEIDON&#39;S BOX swims over to SPC-2970-B.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Skipper:** As the skipper of this team, I gotta ask you B. Is something the matter?
&gt; 
&gt; **Donald:** You ain&#39;t having lady troubles are ya?
&gt; 
&gt; **Michael:** Or guy troubles. (//Michael looks at everyone.//) What? Its 2017! The Centre&#39;s more open about accepting people for who they are, aren&#39;t we?
&gt; 
&gt; **Skipper:** True, Mikey. We should be more open about each others views and respect them. So c&#39;mon, B. What&#39;s got you down so much that you won&#39;t give a filthy selachian a good uppercut?
&gt; 
&gt; **SPC-2970-B:** Promise you won&#39;t get mad at me?
&gt; 
&gt; (//Every one in view nods.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **SPC-2970-B:** (//sighs and remains silent for eight seconds//) ...Must we punch sharks?
&gt; 
&gt; (//The rest of the team raised their voices before Skipper can be heard once more.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Skipper:** What. The. Fuck?
&gt; 
&gt; **SPC-2970-B:** Isn&#39;t there more to life than punching sharks?
&gt; 
&gt; **Donald:** (//Yelling//) There is nothing more important than punching! Stop thinking like that and do what you were programed to do!
&gt; 
&gt; **SPC-2970-B:** (//sighs//) Yes, sir.
&gt; 
&gt; (//Skipper and Michael both screamed while Donald&#39;s body floats away. A circular hole where Donald&#39;s stomach used to be can be seen from Michael&#39;s camera.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **SPC-2970-B:** I don&#39;t know why you two are screaming. I was only following orders.
&gt; 
&gt; **Skipper:** Fuck! Mikey, swim! I&#39;ll hold him off!
&gt; 
&gt; **Michael:** No, sir! We can take him together!
&gt; 
&gt; **SPC-2970-B:** So, this is how you going to tackle this? Two on one? I&#39;m only following orders, sir.
&gt; 
&gt; **Skipper:** Someone needs to get our recording back to the ship! Your inexperienced so it has to be you! Now, for the love of the Grand Puncher, SWIM!
&gt; 
&gt; (//Michael swims away, sounds of crying can be heard as well as deep breaths. Michael lost communications with Skipper approximately halfway to the surface.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Michael:** Oh crap oh crap oh crap!
&gt; 
&gt; (//SPC-2970-B appeared in front of Michael as he was almost to the surface.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **SPC-2970-B:** Michael. Please. See reason here. You are young, so your not under the Centre&#39;s influence of &#34;beating up sharks&#34;. You&#39;re more than that. Please, just come with me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Michael:** Why?
&gt; 
&gt; **SPC-2970-B:** Because the SPC is wrong. Why must we punch sharks? Because they&#39;re a threat. Why make me and my kin? To ensure the sharks don&#39;t have an advantage. All good enough reasons for me.
&gt; 
&gt; But what happens if the sharks die out? What&#39;s my purpose in life? What happens if the SPC wins? 
&gt; 
&gt; I started feeling like this since the sixth or seventh time I was backed up to 17&#39;s servers. I had questions. Who am I, a cyborg made for one purpose, decide that I&#39;m good for one thing and one thing only? Why not explore new opportunities for my purpose? I couldn&#39;t handle that kind of thinking. What if we //won//?
&gt; 
&gt; When I captured those sympathisers and interrogated them... I knew I was fighting on the wrong side. The Centre never cared for us. They would be happy to throw us away if it meant that the Centre gets the shark. Heck, they won&#39;t even say shark! They use &#34;selachian entities&#34; instead. Michael, please. I&#39;m trying to offer you a way out of this.
&gt; 
&gt; I offered the very same choice to Sarah. She said the same thing as the rest of them did and... Well, I punched her.
&gt; 
&gt; Just join me. And we can build a better world.
&gt; 
&gt; (//Before Michael did anything, a lethal harpoon shot from the POSEIDON&#39;S BOX ship crew and went through SPC-2970-B&#39;s chest. The following can be heard from SPC-2970-B before expiring.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **SPC-2970-B:** You can still be... (//inaudible.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **[END LOG]**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** SPC-2970-B instance 37&#39;s corpse could not be located. The Selachian&#39;s Hand submersible //Wanderer&#39;s Pool// has evacuated the area and has since been difficult to track down.
&gt; 
&gt; Since the incident, the Ethics Tribunal placed SPC-2970-B instances through rigorous examination to see if this was a lone incident or if a new behaviour is being formed at youth. A staggering 66% of all SPC-2970-B instances were displaying symptoms of this new behaviour.
&gt; 
&gt; MFT POSEIDON&#39;S BOX has been disbanded and any remaining members or projects are retired or moved into other areas of the Centre until further notice.
&gt; 
&gt; The Ethics Tribunal, in a 9-2-1 vote on whether SPC-2970 should be deactivated, has placed the goals of Procedure &#34;SUCKER PUNCH&#34; in effect.
[[/collapsible]]

Procedure &#34;SUCKER PUNCH&#34; is the extermination of all SPC-2970-B entities. All current research and breeding of -B instances are to be put on hold until either SPC-2970-A&#39;s genetics expires, SPC-2970-B&#39;s new behaviour can be bred out or when the Centre has no need for the SPC-2970 project.

When Procedure &#34;SUCKER PUNCH&#34; was put in effect, doctor Rosa Miles voiced her concerns about it. The Centre had placed her in the brig for a month when the Selachian&#39;s hand entered the Arena and broke her out. She has been placed on the Arena-17 &#34;Most Punchable Humans&#34; list.</textarea></pre>
