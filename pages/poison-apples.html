Oh no. Oh god. It isn&#39;t possible. I...I think I killed Alex.

But I know it&#39;s my fault. When the teachers made us go inside the classrooms, I saw my report card. It was marked 2nd. Alex was probably first again. But somehow Lisa telling me to be 1st made the bus killed him. This sounds crazy, and I think I AM going crazy, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;m the cause. Why would a bus just go straight to the pavement?

A squad of women in suits was writing in notebooks near me. One looked up in my direction, and I ran away. I don&#39;t see the point though. I killed a person, and my home is gone.
