Item #: SCP-6723

__Initial observations:__
* Child&#39;s body
* Doesn&#39;t decay
* Unusually large amt of dust
* Abnormally cold

__Background:__
* Child named Ruth Clark
* Cause of death still unknown?

__Objectives:__
* Reason it doesn&#39;t decay
* Cause of death if possible
* More about background

__Notes:__
I&#39;m hoping this project goes better after all the drama last time. It should be simpler, at least. I&#39;ll just stick to the objectives.

I know I messed up, but being transferred to this site feels like a bit much. As far as I can tell, they really don&#39;t have many resources here. It just seems to be where the higher-ups dump things that aren&#39;t big or important. Despite the obvious lack of funding, though, my division head is in everyone&#39;s business, acting like the Foundation actually cares if we get this stuff done.

I&#39;ll be submitting material requests soon; have to think about what would help determine the whole not decaying thing.

Item #: SCP-6723

__Objectives:__
* Reason it doesn&#39;t decay
* Cause of death
* Background

__Ideas:__
* Autopsy
 * Pros: Quick compared to others, could provide insight into cause of death + possible anomalies
 * Cons: Destructive
* Seeding whole body w/ bacteria, fungus, etc
 * Pros: Provides insight into possible anomalies - can things grow?
 * Cons: Could be destructive, possibly time-consuming
* Growing bacteria, fungus, etc on sample
 * Pros: Provides insight into possible anomalies w/o damaging whole body, less time-consuming than whole body
 * Cons: Possibly less accurate - anomaly could be w/ whole body, possibly time consuming
* Messing w/ environment
 * Pros: Will find out how body reacts to different environments
 * Cons: Uses a lot of space, time consuming
* Monitoring temperature?
 * Pros: Unclear
 * Cons: Unclear

__Notes:__
I&#39;ll submit these ideas for approval and then request materials. I don&#39;t know if the temperature one would actually help anything, but Derek suggested it when I said the body was cold, so who am I to argue?

Apparently, I&#39;m the only one on this project. I&#39;m not complaining, but it feels weird after being at 19 for so long. At least this means there are fewer people that could mess this up for me.

Item #: SCP-6723

__Objectives:__
* Reason it doesn&#39;t decay
* Cause of death
* Background

__Notes:__
The sample idea got approved. If I don&#39;t get much in the way of results, I&#39;ll move on to seeding the whole body, which will, of course, complicate things a bit.

While I&#39;m waiting on the Petri dishes, I&#39;ll look into Ruth&#39;s past; I&#39;m curious as to whether there may have been someone in her life on our side of the veil. Maybe thaumaturgy?

Cutting out the samples was a bit difficult. Not in a physical way, but I kind of feel like I&#39;m still being punished for my mistake. --even after losing--

Item #: SCP-6723

__Objectives:__
* Reason it doesn&#39;t decay
* Cause of death
* Background

__Background info:__
* From small town
 * Redwick, PA
* Three siblings

__Condition:__
* No changes around the area that the sample was taken from.
* Dusty again

__Notes:__
I didn&#39;t have much luck in investigating her --backgru-- background online. I&#39;ll see if I can get anything with Foundation-based resources, but I doubt that they keep records on random people.

I cleaned off the dust since I was a bit worried about it accumulating in the sample area. In hindsight, I probably shouldn&#39;t have done that; it could have interfered with the anomaly. I think it was more of a spur-of-the-moment thing.

Item #: SCP-6723

__Objectives:__
* Reason it doesn&#39;t decay
* Cause of death
* --Background--

__Background notes:__
* Average grades
* Parents seemed not to care much

__Condition:__
* No noticeable changes.

__Notes:__
Unsurprisingly, I didn&#39;t have much luck with Foundation resources, either. Derek told me to focus on the actual anomaly, so no more background research, I guess.

My hand kind of hurt when I woke up this morning. Nothing bad, but it&#39;s pretty itchy now. Hopefully, the thing didn&#39;t come back for my remaining hand.

I&#39;m going to sample the dust and make sure it&#39;s not the --cas-- cause.

__Objectives:__

* Cause of death

__Condition:__
* No noticeable --ca-- changes aside from dust accumulation.

__Notes:__
I was a bit nervous about looking into the dust after Derek&#39;s comments on my investigation, so I ended up not doing it.

Probably just me, but I kind of wish he&#39;d stay out of everyone&#39;s business; he&#39;s not even a scientist.

__Notes:__
I didn&#39;t do much at all today. Since I&#39;ll be checking the samples tomorrow, I&#39;ll ask about the dust.

I&#39;ve been thinking about the incident from the last project, and I&#39;m wondering if Derek knows. Hopefully not, but it would explain why he&#39;s been hovering over my shoulder so much.

__Objectives:__

__Trial 1:__
* Inconclusive results; no growth in control or test groups.

__Notes:__
I must have done something wrong, --sei-- seeing as nothing grew. I made sure to double-check everything for the second trial, so hopefully, whatever I did wrong won&#39;t come up again.

I failed to ask about the dust, but I did ask if they had any other --im-- information. It turns out they did a CT scan and failed to give me the report. Hopefully, I&#39;ll get it within the next few days.

I was thinking about the incident again, and I realized my --mas-- mistake shouldn&#39;t have mattered as much as it did. So what if I didn&#39;t hear --se-- someone once? I have a good track record. I dealt with it quickly.

* Large foreign body

* Numerous rib fractures
 * Believed to be postmortem

__Notes:__
I&#39;ve been struggling a bit with writing; I think it has to do with the --migran-- migraines.

Derek is --str-- starting to nag me about results, which, of course, adds to the stress.

I just --hev-- have to keep doing this. Things will --ca-- change.
