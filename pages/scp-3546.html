[[include component:image-block name=poker.png|caption=//Doggone it, I Fold!//, by Cherise Schultz (2005).]]

**Item #:** SCP-3546

**Object Class:** Neutralized (formerly Euclid)

**Special Containment Procedures:** All works produced by SCP-3546 are to remain in Foundation custody. As these items are non-anomalous, no further action is required.

**Description:** SCP-3546 was Cherise Schultz, a 63-year-old widow previously residing in Cherry Hill, New Jersey (United States). Ms. Schultz reproduced works of art which were indistinguishable (physically, chemically, or otherwise) from their authentic counterparts. Until 2012, Ms. Schultz&#39;s works were regularly purchased by a [[[marshall-carter-and-dark-hub|private firm]]] for use in high-profile instances of forgery, theft, and fraud. 

Ms. Schultz produced these works from non-anomalous materials (typically acrylic paint), applying them in such a way that their arrangement and composition were anomalously transformed into a work identical to one which she had no prior knowledge of. She reproduced several hundred paintings, frescoes, and sculptures during her career; collectively, these works are estimated to have grossed profits in excess of several hundred million (US) dollars. 

Ms. Schultz sold each work for fifty (US) dollars (excluding costs of shipping and handling).

&gt; = **INTERVIEW LOG**

&gt; **DATE:** 2012/07/21
&gt; **INTERVIEWER:** Cmdr. Robert Malthus
&gt; **SUBJECT:** Cherise Schultz
&gt; ----
&gt; **@@[@@**BEGIN LOG.**@@]@@**
&gt; 
&gt; **MALTHUS:** Ms. Schultz, are you -- 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCHULTZ:** Oh, please, call me Cheri. 
&gt; 
&gt; **MALTHUS:** Are you familiar with this painting?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCHULTZ:** Oh, that looks like... hm. Yes, I recognize it. 2007, I think? I remember, because I finished it right before that whole awful market crash. Thank God my husband&#39;s pension wasn&#39;t touched. He always had a head for money. 
&gt; 
&gt; **MALTHUS:** This is //Girl with a Pearl Earring//.  
&gt; 
&gt; **SCHULTZ:** Is that what I called it? I can&#39;t remember the -- 
&gt; 
&gt; **MALTHUS:** It was painted by Johannes Vermeer.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCHULTZ:** Who?
&gt; 
&gt; **MALTHUS:** What about this one? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCHULTZ:** That&#39;s -- I did that one in 2009. //A Farmer&#39;s Life//. What is this -- 
&gt; 
&gt; **MALTHUS:** This is //American Gothic//, by Grant Wood. It was painted in 1930.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCHULTZ:** What? 
&gt; 
&gt; **MALTHUS:** And this?
&gt; 
&gt; **[**//Silence.//**]**
&gt; 
&gt; **SCHULTZ:** What is this about?
&gt; 
&gt; **MALTHUS:** Do you recognize this work, Ms. Schultz?
&gt; 
&gt; **[**//Silence.//**]**
&gt; 
&gt; **SCHULTZ:** Yes. I finished it just last year. I was very proud of it. One of my largest pieces. I call it //Barnyard Hijinks//.
&gt; 
&gt; **MALTHUS:** This is Pablo Picasso&#39;s //Guernica//. 
&gt; 
&gt; **[**//Silence.//**]**
&gt; 
&gt; **SCHULTZ:** Who are you?
&gt; 
&gt; **MALTHUS:** Ms. Schultz, where did you learn to paint?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCHULTZ:** I -- I don&#39;t know. After my husband died, I just started -- I don&#39;t know. I just needed a creative outlet. I love painting. I&#39;m very good at it. It just came naturally. That&#39;s normal, right? Natural talent. I&#39;m a very expressive person, and I just thought that -- who are you?
&gt; 
&gt; **MALTHUS:** Ma&#39;am, I need you to come with us.
