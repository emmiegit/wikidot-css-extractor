//(Hallway #3, Wing-A. Engle approaches a locked door down the hall. He holds a keycard up to the scanner and the door opens.)// [[footnote]]Upon closer analysis of the footage, the card scanner does not appear to show the color change indicating the keycard as valid.[[/footnote]]

//(He enters a large room, full of file cabinets along with a few computers placed against the wall. Engle sits down at one that is obscured in the footage by the cabinets.)//

**Engle:** I’m in. How long do I have?

**Female Voice:** If you’re lucky? 3 hours. Though a more realistic estimation would be just 2 hours.

**Engle:** And how much luck is in the cards today?

//(Clacking of a keyboard, clicking of a mouse.)//

**Engle:** “Incident 23-1 Gamma.” //Manahiem.// “Murder took place at…” “Corpses suffered anomalous transfiguration…” …What? “Believed to be connected to the Children of the Scarlet King sect operating in the area. Suspect is–”

//(The lights in the room suddenly turn off. Adam falls silent.)//

**Female Voice:** What happened?

//(Engle does not respond. In the distance, a computer monitor lights up and an unintelligible noise begins playing from it. Engle slowly approaches the disturbance, indicated by the noise gradually increasing in volume.)//

//(As he gets closer, the noise is made out to be the name “Pinocchio” being repeatedly called out. Engle reaches out towards the computer, while a figure approaches from behind and reaches for his shoulder.)//

**Unknown Person:** Adam.

//(Engle spins around and grabs the person’s arm, restraining them.)//

**Engle:** What’s your angle? Who are you!

**Unknown Person:** Woah, woah! It’s just me, dude. It’s Dan!

//(The lights turn back on, revealing the individual to be agent Daniel Cho. Engle releases his grip while pocketing his phone.)//

**Engle:** //Jesus Christ//, man. In what world would you think that was a good idea?

**Cho:** I just wanted to know what you were doing and why you turned off the lights.

**Engle:** Then why did– what do you mean?

**Cho:** //(He motions to the computer.)// Why are you watching cartoons in here?

//(Engle looks at the computer, on which the 1940 movie Pinocchio -- specifically, the scene in the movie in which Geppetto searches for Pinocchio -- has been playing.)//

**Engle:** I wasn’t, I… //(Sighs)// Nevermind.

**Cho:** Whatever, man. //(Pause)// Hey, are you doing okay?

**Engle:** //(Pause)// Yeah.

**Cho:** Okay. Cause I know this case has been stressing you out lately, so if you need someone vent or just talk to, I’m always open.

**Engle:** I appreciate it.

//(Cho nods before leaving the room, slipping slightly on a puddle prior to exiting. Engle takes out his phone.)//

**Female Voice:** It might be best to find everything you need and then bounce.

**Engle:** Right…

//(Adam returns to his computer.)//

**Engle:** “Level 4/7547 Access.”

“Observation of the ritual indicates it is approaching 70% completion. SCP-7547-OMEGA (Adam Engle) has a current Foundation Loyalty score of 94; within acceptable margins but lower than in past months. SCP-7547-OMEGA is to be placed under increased supervision so as to maintain the Foundation’s control on the approaching SCK-Class (Paradigm Shift) Scenario. Data predictions show if all goes according to plan, containment success rates will increase by 15% and the Foundation will possess greater jurisdiction over the planet earth and reality as a whole.”

//(Pause.)//

**Female Voice:** They were using you.

//(Pause.)//

**Engle:** “It is unknown how many groups are aware of the truth of SCP-7547, but it is confirmed that the Global Occult Coalition, Serpent’s Hand, and Marshal, Carter, &amp; Dark are aware of the purpose of the ritual.”

//(Pause.)//

**Female Voice:** We could trip the alarms, you know. Have them run in and amnestisize you.

**Engle:** You do that and you’re right back at square one, without little old dash omega under your thumb.

**Unknown Voice:** Read the Incident again.

**Engle:** “...Connected to the Children of the Scarlet King sect operating in the area. Suspect is believed to be… Evan Boothe...”

//(Engle backs away from the screen, bumping into a cabinet before stumbling out of the room.)//

//(He walks down the hall, visibly disoriented. As he does he starts quickening his pace, before sprinting and then finally running.)//

//(He continues running and enters a door not shown on Site-55’s blueprints. Over the phone, the sound of footsteps in shallow water followed by a crashing noise is audible.)//
