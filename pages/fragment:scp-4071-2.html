    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Item #:** SCP-4071

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation web crawlers are to monitor the internet for reports of inconsistencies between documented events and human memory. Any documentation which mentions a SCP-4071-1 instance is to be immediately removed from circulation. Depending on the extent of the presence of SCP-4071-1 in each affected documentation, and how widely spread it has been, a new copy of the documentation may be created to replace the SCP-4071-2 instances.

Task Force //History Buffs// has been formed, comprising of several hundred individuals with extremely high scores on memory tests. The members of this group are not to be allowed any unsupervised contact with any other individual. They are not to be given access to any communication device. This position is strictly voluntary. Each member is to be assigned a selection of documentation for all known SCPs, sites, MTF groups, GoIs, ongoing operations, and any other Foundation information. Each day, they are to check their documentation to ensure that no information has been lost. Any discrepancy between memory and documentation is to be immediately reported to all involved personnel.

**Description:** SCP-4071 is a phenomenon in which events simultaneously disappear from the memories of the entire human population. While individuals can reacquire memories of the events through reading documentation, there appears to be a moderate disposition towards considering the documentation untrustworthy. This has resulted in significant changes in reality even when documentation contradicting human memory is wide-spread and readily available.

SCP-4071-1 refers to the events that have been expunged from human memory. While these events initially tended to be concerned with political situations, they have become increasingly random over time.

SCP-4071-2 refers to //The Anti-Recall System//, the computer program by which this phenomenon was initially created. Each event inputted into the program is instantly and simultaneously removed from the memories of all human beings. Although this was initially the sole method of which memories could be removed, SCP-4071 has since become an unstable and unpredictable phenomenon, with events being removed from memory seemingly at complete random.

While the Manna Charitable Foundation has ceased using SCP-4071-2 since becoming aware of this, SCP-4071-1 have continues to occur at a steadily increasing rate. It is predicted that all human memories will be completely removed within approximately thirty years. However, the Foundation is currently unable to confidently identify the exact number of SCP-4071-1 events are occurring. This, combined with the unpredictability of which memories will be removed, makes it extremely likely that the maximum span of time is less than this. This is particularly the case if memories vital to survival are removed from human knowledge.

&gt; **Interviewed:** Mrs Laura Wessex, Executive Director of the Manna Charitable Foundation
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Agent Mary Fields
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Mrs Wessex approached Foundation personnel claiming that they had vital knowledge of an SCP currently causing an CK-class restructuring scenario.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Fields:** I’m Agent Mary Fields. I’ve been informed that you have something important that you believe that the Foundation needs to be aware of..
&gt; 
&gt; **Mrs Wessex:** Yes. Normally we – I – wouldn’t approach the Foundation, but this has gotten bigger than we can handle.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Fields:** “We?” Could you please tell me who you are, and who else you are referring to?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mrs Wessex:** Right, yes. I’m Mrs Laura Wessex. I’m the Executive Director of the Manna Charitable Foundation.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Fields:** And what is this CK-class restructuring scenario that you wanted to inform the Foundation about?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mrs Wessex:** History as we know it is being removed from the memory of every human being on this earth.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Fields:** That’s… Quite a claim. How is it that this is happening?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mrs Wessex:** A few months ago, we were approached by an individual offering us a donation. It was a computer. The only thing on this computer was a program called //The Anti-Recall System//. We were told that it would allow us to remove the memories of any event we chose from every human being on earth.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Fields:** I assume that your group saw this opportunity and leapt at it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mrs Wessex:** [Laughs bitterly] Of course we did! This could end every instance of conflict simply by inputting information into a computer program.. From grudges between countries right down to the individual level, if need be. We were suddenly able to make the world a safer place. Of course we used it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Fields:** I take it this is why there’s recently been a discrepancy between documentation and human memory?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mrs Wessex:** Yes. We didn’t think… We didn’t realise that this only affected memory, nothing else. But even when we did, it was still worth it, especially since we knew that you would clean up after us.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Fields:** Well then. If everything is going to your plan, why are you here, then?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mrs Wessex:** That’s just it. For the first month or so, it was all fine. With each event we removed, people put down their weapons, and corruption seemed to vanish overnight. Sure, there were a few bumps along the way, but even so, the world was getting better. However, we soon realised that events we hadn’t selected were also being removed.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Fields:** Like what?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mrs Wessex:** There was no rhyme and reason to them! Some of them were trivial, like a monarch being crowned centuries ago, while others were devastating, like the construction of a residential skyscraper!
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Fields:** So that’s when you decided to come to us, huh? Weeks after you realised that you’d instigated an CK-class restructuring scenario?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mrs Wessex:** You know why we couldn’t come to you. The Foundation would have taken it away from us, tried to reverse all the good we did. So instead we stopped using it. For a while we thought it had worked… But soon we realised the extent of our problems, and, well, here I am. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Fields:** Do you have anything else to add?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mrs Wessex:** No. Yes. Please, don’t undo the good we did. We screwed up, but we also ended a lot of long-standing conflict. Please…
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Fields:** You know that’s not possible.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mrs Wessex:** We only wanted to help. It’s up to you to decide whether our efforts will make the world a better place, or whether they were all for nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Mrs Wessex was able to provide detailed records of every SCP-4071-1 event that the Manna Charitable Foundation caused, confirming her story.

&gt; To whom it may concern,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; As per our decision to keep all information on SCP-4071 in writing in case of a SCP-4071-1 instance removing important knowledge, I am sending this update via email as well as in person.
&gt; 
&gt; As we all know, SCP-4071 is a CK-class restructuring scenario which, if we don’t act to prevent, will eventually turn into an XK-class end-of-the-world scenario. As a result, we have numerous people working around the clock to attempt to engineer a way to reverse SCP-4071, or at least halt the emergence of new SCP-4071-1 instances.
&gt; 
&gt; Currently, the most promising avenue is an imagery-based countermeme that the Memetics and Infohazards Division is working on. The aim of this countermeme is to make people completely immune to new SCP-4071-1 instances. Ideally, it would also allow individuals to regain memories that SCP-4071 has caused them to lose. However, we believe that it will require direct exposure to an individual in order for it to be effective. If this countermeme does prove successful, we should expect a logistical nightmare to expose the global population to this countermeme.
&gt; 
&gt; Indeed, even if the countermeme is successful, the Foundation will still have a considerable task on its hands in order to return the world to baseline history. We need to start considering a how to achieve this. The current proposal is for the Foundation, in collaboration with many other organisations and governments, to remove all traces of the past several months. Once this has been achieved, we would amesticise the global population to match this. Once we find an effective countermeme, we will begin to formulate more in-depth plans. Until then, we can only hope that nothing important becomes an SCP-4071-1 instance.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Dr Michael Pearson
&gt; Head of the SCP-4071 Department
