Following the regular implementation of Procedure 610-Sinclair, SCP-4495 has achieved sufficient ectoentropic stability, and is no longer considered at risk of instigating an NK-Class Scenario. Legacy containment procedures are kept on record in the event that 610-Sinclair is no longer viable.

[[/div]]
[[/div]]
**Special Containment Procedures:** Relevant personnel are to execute Procedure 610-Sinclair on a daily basis, and maintenance personnel are to inspect SCP-4495&#39;s containment chamber on a biweekly basis.

SCP-4495 is contained inside of a three-tiered cell, each tier separated by a grated floor:
* SCP-4495 resides on the top tier, strapped into an alcove in the southern wall. SCP-4495&#39;s stomach is positioned at an acute angle with respect to the floor, allowing SCP-4495-1 to immediately fall through the grating upon generation. To prevent the buildup of stuck instances of SCP-4495-1, the grating is to be sprayed hourly by a series of built-in pressure-washers. The top tier is to remain refrigerated in the interests of reducing miasma.
* The middle tier contains a combination grinder and incinerator. Instances of SCP-4495-1 are forced into the machine through a funnel, emerging from the bottom as a temporarily inert paste. This process takes under 10 minutes.
* The bottom tier contains implements required for Procedure 610-Sinclair. Should Procedure 610-Sinclair become nonviable, SCP-4495-1 paste is to be pressed as thinly as possible, vacuum sealed, and stored in Site-56&#39;s provisional storage wing.

Relevant personnel are to read Document 4495-610 at the nearest opportunity.

**Description:** SCP-4495 is the partially decomposed corpse of an unidentified cryptid. Superficially, it resembles a bipedal pig clad in regal wear reclining upon a throne; however, closer examination reveals that the throne, figure, and raiments all constitute a single immobile organism (comprised of keratin, bone, and skin).

SCP-4495&#39;s ventral torso has ruptured; periodic contractions along its abdominal cavity continuously forces instances of SCP-4495-1 outward. Instances of SCP-4495-1 superficially resemble porcine intestines. SCP-4495-1 are animate, and behave in a manner roughly analogous to pythons, with the exception of extreme aggression in the presence of animal life.

While instances of SCP-4495-1 can be damaged normally, they will reform if given enough time. Exposure to high temperatures delays this process, but does not halt it entirely. SCP-4495-1 can only be permanently destroyed through application of Procedure 610-Sinclair.

[[div class=&#34;body-text&#34;]]

++ ANALYSIS OF SCP-4495-1

[[&lt;]]
The following is a full-scale analysis of SCP-4495-1, authorized on 26/08/2008 by Director Agatha Drummond and primarily conducted by Drs. Rivka Yarkoni and Daniel Gums. This study was taken under the following assumptions:

# That SCP-4495 was either related to or intended to resemble a member of the Suidae family of animals.
# That SCP-4495 could be considered alive, dead, or inanimate, but theories which claimed inanimacy must remain exclusive from ones suggesting a biological origin.
# That if SCP-4495 could only be considered alive or dead, SCP-4495-1 was related to or intended to resemble animal intestines.
# That SCP-4495 ran the risk of causing an NK-Class Grey Goo Scenario if a method of permanently destroying SCP-4495-1 was not developed.

As stated in SCP-4495&#39;s description, SCP-4495-1 resemble porcine intestines. However, instances of SCP-4495-1 are variable in shape and size to the extent that, assuming SCP-4495-1 functions as a theoretical living instance of SCP-4495&#39;s intestines, SCP-4495 as a species would either have possessed a theoretically infinite number of vestigial digestive systems or a radically variable diet between individuals.

SCP-4495-1 was initially subjected to several rounds of chemical testing. Initial reports concluded that SCP-4495-1 was chemically inert. However, as such a conclusion would necessitate the usage of anomalous disposal methods, the Pepper Protocol was invoked, and chemical testing was to be continued for a period of a week.

On 02/09/2008, Junior Researcher Malcolm Johnson violated quarantine protocols when he vomited on his respective batch of SCP-4495-1. Novel chemical reactions were immediately observed.

++ DETAILS OF PROCEDURE 610-SINCLAIR.

[[&lt;]]
[[include component:image-block name=30to50.PNG|caption=SCP-4495-1 in preparation for disposal.]]
# SCP-4495-1 paste is cleansed of grime through a food-safe cleaning mechanism.
# The resulting paste is then reheated over a period of an hour at 400 degrees Celsius.
# Paste is separated into a series of measured portions depending on the culinary attitudes of the Foundation.
# Portions are to be fitted with a fake casing.
# Portions are to be served to Foundation personnel on standard diet plans in lieu of pork.
# Unsold portions are to be fed to D-Class personnel as part of URA-2677&#39;s containment protocols.
# Uneaten portions of SCP-4495-1 are to be filtered out of Site-56&#39;s waste disposal system, thoroughly cleansed, and retreated with Procedure 610-Sinclair.

Extensive experimentation shows that SCP-4495-1 is culinarily similar to common pork, with superior nutritional benefits and lower levels of cholesterol and saturated fats. This is in addition to its longevity; SCP-4495-1 treated with Procedure 610-Sinclair does not decay, and will remain inanimate for approximately two weeks without additional heat treatment.

Most importantly, in addition to providing a better ratio of caloric content, consumption of SCP-4495-1 produces virtually no waste matter; a significant portion of SCP-4495-1 is essentially annihilated upon digestion. 

[[[site-81-community-cookbook|Mass implementation of Procedure 610-Sinclair is projected to save a significant amount of money on culinary expenses]]]. Disinformation efforts are underway in the form of increased sanitary regulations.
