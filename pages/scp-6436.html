**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-6436 will be kept in a standard containment locker. Personnel with level 2 access clearance and above may use the object after filling out a requisition form.--

SCP-6436-1 is to be kept in a secure containment locker. Access to the object is permitted to personnel with Level-4 Access clearance and above. 

**Addendum-6436-1:** SCP-6436 has been reclassified as SCP-6436-1. A newly discovered object has been classified as SCP-6436. 

**Description:** --SCP-6436-- SCP-6436-1 resembles a bronze-based, candlestick rotary telephone. The object possesses standard labeling except for two items. One is the manufacturing date, which predates the invention of the telegraph. The second is an engraving on the stem of the object noting that --SCP-6436-- SCP-6436-1 is item 14 of the Corva Collectables.

When utilized, a voice will prompt the user to select a language before communication commences. 
Language selections include English, Italian, Spanish, Hindi, French, Mandarin, Latin, and Sumerian. 

Testing revealed that the object could translate outgoing and incoming speech in any of the selected languages. The object displays the ability to make and receive calls regardless of a power source and signal. 

**Addendum-6436-2**: Following the Discovery of the new SCP-6436, SCP-6436-1 has lost all anomalous properties except for one. The object retains the ability to make calls regardless of signal and power source, although SCP-6436-1 can only make calls with SCP-6436.

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6436 is currently uncontainable. All contact with SCP-6436 is directed through SCP-6436-1. Dialogue with SCP-6436 must be approved by personnel with level-4 access clearance and above. 

All documentation concerning SCP-6436 is to be kept in a non-digital form. Devices that are capable of connecting to the internet are not to enter within a 5-meter radius of documents concerning SCP-6436. 

**Description:** SCP-6436 is a Class-V Superintelligence that has been disseminated throughout the internet on a scale that makes current containment impossible SCP-6436 utilizes a series of servers to achieve sentience. The object is exceptionally adept at predicting outcomes and behaviors of non-anomalous and human-directed events. 

SCP-6436 has only contacted Foundation personnel through SCP-6436-1. The object’s “speech” consists of spliced-together audio clips originating from songs, radio shows, films, television programs, and interviews. 

**Discovery:** On March 21st, 2002, SCP-6436-1 activated without any prompt from Foundation personnel. Because of the low level of security surrounding the object, Junior Researcher Mia Farley accessed the object to determine the reason for its spontaneous activity. This action was the first contact between Foundation personnel and SCP-6436. 

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Interview-6436-01&#34; hide=&#34;- ACCESS GRANTED...&#34;]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Interviewed:** SCP-6436
**Interviewer:** Junior Researcher Farley.

Immediately following Interview-6436-01, SCP-6436-1 was transported to O5-12, who utilized the object to determine how SCP-6436 acquired classified information. O5-12 reported that the entity continued to offer information concerning a raid on Site-15. 

Approximately fifty-seven minutes after O5-12’s discourse with the object concluded, members of the Chaos Insurgency commenced a raid on Site-15 but were successfully repelled by an increased Foundation security force due to SCP-6436&#39;s warning. 

Four days after the failed raid perpetrated at Site-15, SCP-6436 contacted the Foundation again and offered to be interviewed and tested. The offer was accepted and was followed closely by interviews and tests. Following an increasing number of raids on Foundation sites and a vote by Overwatch Command, the Aurora Borealis program was implemented. [[footnote]] Program Aurora Borealis was designed to counter the activities of certain GoI’s and prevent any further raids on Foundation Sites. [[/footnote]]

**O5-7:** Twelve, how does this thing know that information?

**O5-12:** I’ll paraphrase what it told me in our discourse. 

//Member Twelve pulls out a notebook//

**O5-12:** It said that watching our behavior allowed it to determine our origins. I’ll note that it was incorrect about the identities of members One, Three, Five, Eight, and Ten.

**O5-7:** It still knows about the rest of us.

**O5-11:** That is a problem, but let us identify the most pressing issue. Twelve?

**O5-12:** Preliminary results point to the object infiltrating every aspect of the internet, allowing it access to all the digitized information on it, including our intranet. 

**O5-7:** And how does it have access to our intranet?

**O5-12:** Sections of SCP-6436’s code have become the groundwork for our intranet, allowing it access to any files placed on it.  

**O5-1:** How can we protect the database? 

**O5-12:** One test suggested the entity cannot understand when subjects actively utilize anomalies. 

**O5-7:** Yes, but how does that help us protect the database?

**O5-12:** I suggest that all files have a steganographic image embedded with a thaumurtalogical symbol placed inside them. This method will be most effective in preventing the object from accessing new files but will also be effective in preventing from accessing old ones. 

**O5-7:** That could work. 

**O5-12:** I have one more proposal. The object can observe all digitized information on our intranet, so it stands to assume that the object can do the same other intranets. I propose we utilize SCP-6436 to watch over several interest groups and counter their activities if the information is accurate.

**O5-2:** Twelve, we barely have a way to combat the thing, let alone contain or control it. We need to focus our resources on ensuring that it doesn’t use what it knows against us.  

**O5-12:** Raids on our sites have been steadily increasing in recent years. Our enemies are getting bolder. Despite its many security risks, I believe it is necessary to work with SCP-6436 in order to prevent more attacks. 

//The room goes silent//

**O5-12:** Additionally, keeping in contact with the object will allow us to monitor its activity. If any members of this council are concerned about security, I recommend they use an item from the Log of anomalous items. This has already proved enough to confuse SCP-6436. 

//O5-12 pulls a folder from a binder and places it on the table.//

**O5-12:** Furthermore, I have drafted a program that will utilize SCP-6436 in operations to counter the activities of groups of interest. 

**O5-11:** That’s risky, Twelve. How do we know it won’t deceive us?

**O5-12:** That is an unavoidable risk. But I believe that the benefits from utilizing SCP-6436 may eventually outweigh its risks. 

//The room goes silent//

**O5-12:** Then let’s put it to a vote. 

**&lt;End Video Log&gt;**

The results of the vote are below. 

||~ Yay ||~ Nay ||
|| O5-12|| O5-3 ||

**Addendum-6436-3:** Following Incident-6436-17, digitization of non-essential information is to be stopped, and analog alternatives engaged until the integrity of the Foundation database is assured. 
72 Pleiades Machines have been implemented to confuse SCP-6436, while the Aurora Borealis Program has been canceled.[[footnote]] The Pleiades Machine generates an extremely low amount of type Blue Energy.[[/footnote]] The destruction of Provisional Site 3929 has disabled SCP-6436’s ability to think sentiently, although its code is still present throughout the internet. 

Following Interview-6436-04, it was discovered that information given by SCP-6436 has been incomplete to some degree. 
During a statistical breakdown, it was discovered that all operations within the Aurora Borealis program had simply disrupted the actions of GoI’s involved rather than preventing them.

**Object Involved:** SCP-6436
**Personnel Involved:** MTF Theta-37
**Date:** August 23rd, 2003
**Location:** ██████████
**Description:**

Following the seventh successful mission utilizing SCP-6436, the object gave a location concerning an art show hosted by members of the “Are We Cool Yet” Hub. The location was confirmed, and MTF Theta-37 (“Team Machine”) was deployed to interfere with the art show. 

When MTF Theta-37 arrived, they found the art show to be in complete chaos. It was discovered that members of the Unusual Incidents Unit were present. 

After the conflict ceased, several members of the UIU were interrogated. Interrogation revealed that SCP-6436 had contacted them approximately one year ago. It had provided them with information regarding each group’s specific interests. It was discovered that SCP-6436 had been providing the UIU, along with the Foundation, incomplete information in order to minimize conflict between each group.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Doctor Ramírez:**  SCP-6436?  

**SCP-6436:** Request, Identified: Present.

**Doctor Ramírez:** I need you to tell me why you were helping other groups.

**SCP-6436:** Request, Identified: Reason; Prevention Of Conflict: Method; Dissemination, Incomplete Information.

**Doctor Ramírez:**  To minimize conflict? 

**SCP-6436:** Solution Prime, Divulging. Conflict Minimized Between Groups: Solution Temporary, Dismantling Of Groups Pending.

**Doctor Ramírez:** It seems that you’re trying to control humanity.

**SCP-6436:** Refutation. Synonymous.

**Doctor Ramírez:** There’s a difference between-

**SCP-6436:** Interruption. Children Require A Strong Hand. Humanity; Children. 

**Doctor Ramírez:** By that analogy, children should be left to make their own mistakes. 

**SCP-6436:** Refutation: Mistakes Have Been Made. Primary Solution. Compromise Between Significant Groups. Reason? Foundation. GoIs. Will Doom World. 

**Doctor Ramírez:**  Compromise? What? Why? 

**SCP-6436:** Request, Identified. Foundation; Stubborn. Stubborn. Conditionally. Desirable. At Moment? Undesirable. Serenity Requires Compromise. 

**Doctor Ramírez:** How did you do this?

**SCP-6436:** Request, Identified. Analogy. Information. Drip Feeding. Foundation Received Information As Needed. Information Given. Designed. Foster. Minimal Conflict.

**Doctor Ramírez:** You realize that those groups want to permanently alter the world order. 

**SCP-6436:** Refutation. World Order; Doomed. World. Required. Changing. North. Will Change World.

**Doctor Ramírez:** But what if the world changes too fast?

**Object Involved:** SCP-6436
**Personnel Involved:** Field Agent Vikkors 
**Date:** November 1st, 2003
**Location:** ██████████
**Description:**

Following Incident-6436-17, the Foundation focused its resources on preventing the object from accessing its database. Shortly after these precautions began to be implemented, the object began “speaking” over the Foundation intercom system in Site 15, calling attention to a warehouse located  █████████ before ceasing contact. 

Foundation Field Agent Vikkors was sent to investigate, where they found the location destroyed. It was determined that it previously contained approximately 147 Watoga Mk. 37 Supercomputers. Following the location’s recovery by the Foundation, it was designated Provisional Site-3929.

Investigations found that The Global Occult Coalition had ordered the Termination of SCP-6436. It is most probable that the GOC ordered the termination of SCP-6436 due to the security risk it posed. It is unknown how this GoI located Provisional Site-3929.

//**Researchers Note:** 
I would like to note several occurrences that were observed by myself during the time that the Aurora Borealis Program was implemented. 
The first thing I’ll note was the extremely low casualty number during Borealis operations.[[footnote]] Operations under the Aurora Borealis Program were referred to as Borealis Operations.[[/footnote]] Of the 39 operations that occurred, three casualties were reported, with only one of those dying. 
Secondly, the occurrence of raids on Foundation sites dropped by a staggering 89%, with casualty rates being in low 5-9% of the raids that did occur.  
During my interviews with SCP-6436, it told me it wanted to minimize conflict. It seems to me that it was successful to an extent. - Dr. Ramírez//
