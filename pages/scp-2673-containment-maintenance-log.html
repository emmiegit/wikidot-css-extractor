Poems are jails to Two-Six-Seven-Three.
They keep it restrained in a maze of words,
The locks of metre and prisons of form.
This skip is contained, never to be freed.

They keep it restrained, in a maze of words
Where Two-Six-Seven-Three is lost in verse.
This skip is contained, never to be freed,
Never can it breach our containment.

Where? Two-Six-Seven-Three is lost in verse,
While we craft more verse to keep it contained.
Never can it breach! Our containment
Is the perfect jail for a thing of memes.

**Comments:** Merry Christmas from the poetry elves!

&#39;Twas the day after deadline and, sodden with Moët,
Not a creature was stirring, not even the poet.
His &#34;Poems&#34; were sent to the printers with care
In hopes that the verses within they would share.
And Clement Clarke Moore, drunk and snoring in bed,
Had visions of Livingston dance in his head.

He dreamt that the Major, a shadowy wraith,
Sprang up from its tomb, in defiance of faith.
And with fingers of icy mist holding Moore fast,
It drew him inexorably into the past.
To March 1820, a night bleak and wet,
To relive the dark secret Moore learned when they&#39;d met.

&#34;A mad, drunken soldier,&#34; he later recalled,
&#34;Kept impressing upon me some dogg&#39;rel he&#39;d scrawled.
As if, through my post as a Literature don
I could tell how to salvage a muse so far gone.&#34;
And yet (as he never admitted), once read
Some foul //thing// left the paper and lodged in his head.

For full twenty years it infected his mind.
He grew more erratic, effete and unkind.
He cursed in his sermons, without his volition,
He railed against Jefferson, fought Abolition.
He even took risks in a real estate wager -
until he discovered the fate of the Major:

Hank Livingston (Junior) had suffered for longer;
The hunter&#39;s effect on his mind had been stronger.
Risked life in the army in &#39;74,
But far worse was to come on return from the war:
His year-old son, dead, &#34;accidentally&#34; burned;
Soon after, his wife to the earth was returned.

Now he knew the spiral of Livingston&#39;s life,
Moore feared for his own career, children and wife.
He recalled the black verse from that first, fatal night
And Moore guessed that the only escape was to write,
To release the thought-parasite out of his brain:
By transmitting insanity, make himself sane.

Moore quickly commissioned his &#34;Poems&#34; for print
With &#34;St Nicholas&#34; nestled there; never a hint
Of the theft of each syllable Livingston wrote,
Or the memetic virus it sought to promote.
Moore could scarcely imagine just how widely read
And beloved it became. So why aren&#39;t we all dead?

Well, when gatherings festive chant carols diverse,
When those bright young eyes plead for their favourite verse,
Just be thankful we found where the hunter endured
And are writing these poems to keep it secured.
And we&#39;ll hear you exclaim, in a tone of respect:
&#34;Merry Christmas to all who contain and protect!&#34;

**Comments:** We haven&#39;t made any attempt to contain it in almost a year. I might as well.

The creature stalked the comma and choked the apostrophe.
It stomped upon the period, that 2673!
No question mark can stop him, so I guess it&#39;s up to me
to stop the written terror that is 2673!

It started with the free form verse, that answered the needed call,
to stall this visious verbal beast. Just too bad it was mauled!
It then went to a haiku, and while virtuous was he,
he was efficiently slaughtered by this ferocious SCP!

The creature stalked the comma and choked the apostrophe.
It stomped upon the period, that 2673!
No question mark can stop him, so I guess it&#39;s up to me
to stop the written terror that is 2673!

It made it&#39;s way to the limerick and smashed it to a pulp,
and then it went to the triolet and swallowed it in one gulp.
Then it came upon another haiku, and boy was it a fight!
The simple minded poem kept it down for many nights.

The creature stalked the comma and choked the apostrophe.
It stomped upon the period, that 2673!
No question mark can stop him, so I guess it&#39;s up to me
to stop the written terror that is 2673!

It finally defeated it&#39;s poor ancient and wise foe,
and came across the next poem and wrecked it, don&#39;t you know?
Its next threat, the pantuom, had packed quite of a punch
but eventually ol&#39; 2673 had that sad poem for lunch!

The creature stalked the comma and choked the apostrophe.
It stomped upon the period, that 2673!

The classy sonnet was what was next, though it seemed that he was beat,
It turned out that defeating him was not a easy feat.
The ancient beast was trapped in a Shakespearean maze,
but by the time 2016 had come the dear sonnets eyes were glazed!

The creature stalked the comma and choked the apostrophe.
It stomped upon the period, that 2673!
No question mark can stop him, so I guess it&#39;s up to me
to stop the written terror that is 2673!

Now Christmas is upon us, and the creature&#39;s nearly freed,
so I conjured up this poem to fulfill this frightful need.
I hope it does it&#39;s job well, and doesn&#39;t become too scorched
when our Night Before Christmas parody passes down her terrifying torch!

The creature stalked the comma and choked the apostrophe.
It stomped upon the period, that 2673!
No question mark can stop him, so I guess it&#39;s up to me
to Secure Contain and then Protect this horrid SCP!

Roses are red,
warning lights too,
and both night shift poets

So I wrote this bad poem,
containment to patch,
and now sit here praying
it lasts through the watch.

**Comment:** Reinforcement of containment with a villainelle

Within these walls, the skip is sealed.
Though howl and growl and rage it may
Our minds are safe, these lines our shield.
To rhyming verse the skip must yield
Never shall it see light of day.
Within these walls, the skip is sealed.
It may not leave nor power wield
And for its crimes a price must pay.
Our minds are safe, these lines our shield.
Into this net the skip was reeled
With lines of poems to bar the way.
Within these walls, the skip is sealed.
And that it will not be revealed;
That all may live in peace and say,
&#34;Our minds are safe, these lines our shield&#34;;
We keep the skip in odes concealed
Inside a file, all dull and grey.
Within these walls, the skip is sealed.
Our minds are safe, these lines our shield.

**Date:** 04/24/2018
**Comment:** One year has passed since last containment; adding reinforcement

Within these walls it shall remain,
Imprisoning 2-6-7-3 in words and lyric.
With verse and rhyme this will sustain,
Its lengthy prison of words and lyric.

Bind this skip forever in poetry,
A captive of words and lyric.
Long may this keep 2-6-7-3,
Captured again by words and lyric.

Never ending shall we rhyme,
To keep the skip in words and lyric.
A cell that stands for all of time,
2-6-7-3 chained to words and lyric.

Two Six Seven Three:
Verse prevents it breaking free.

**Date:** 04/30/2019
**Comment:** It&#39;s been far too long. I&#39;m locking this thing down with everything we have - internal rhyme, multiple references, poetry puns even.

Jumping hoops for a skip
With our acrobat words,
Fly away, twenty-six,
Poetry&#39;s for the birds.

Seven-three, you must see
There&#39;s no ballad too frail
By our metric, we&#39;re skeptic
Poetry&#39;ll ever fail.

In a prison of rhythm
You versus our verse
No escape, far too late,
Poetry is your curse.

So give up, little skip;
As I type my refrains,
Two-six-seventy-three
Poetry will contain.

**Date:** 03/09/2020
**Comment:** Maybe it perceives songs as poetry? I mean, they are technically the same thing, right?

A land of hell, behold the tears
Protect humanity from beast&#39;s savage leers
Statues that crush bones, blink and death nears
Reptiles invincible, dogs with tongues of peers
And plague doctors, the seven deadly sins it reveres

Host to criminal
Who&#39;s life is minimal
They seem rather cynical
But fear not friends
For they&#39;re on our side
Up against the tide
Their time they will bide
For they&#39;re the ones who die in the dark
SO WE CAN LIVE IN THE LIGHT

They will defy, so we don&#39;t deny
We caught their eye, we are gold in disguise
And they will defy while they hold to their lies
We won&#39;t defy as they work on Earth&#39;s tie
They are the souls of the world
With no grasp on the curled
With all due respect
Secure. Contain. Protect.

A land of hell, behold these lines
Words to us all, bars that confines
Four numbers it stands, four like the wind chimes
A two, six, seven, three, but no ones or nines
Held together by words, all of which rhymes

Men and women
Must all come within
Pens are a weapon
Againsts this plague
In this one beast&#39;s den
To fight again

For they&#39;re the ones who die in the dark
SO WE CAN LIVE IN THE LIGHT

They will defy, so we don&#39;t deny
We caught their eye, we are gold in disguise
And they will defy while they hold to their lies
We won&#39;t defy as they work on Earth&#39;s tie
They are the souls of the world
With no grasp on the curled
With all due respect
Secure. Contain. Protect.

**Date:** 03/21/2020
**Comment:** Site Director overheard me humming Gilbert and Sullivan. I hope this helps.

Two six seven and three
Form the title, you see
Of a hideous being memetical
Which a deep pleasure finds
In corrupting our minds
With ideas most truly heretical.
It forms bright glowing pyres
Of our basest desires
For pleasure and simple security,
And then once it has supped
On our pleasures corrupt
It destroys all our lives in its purity.

A taste for rare dishes
Consumes one man&#39;s wishes
Until his cholesterol rockets,
While another soon drools
For silver and jewels
And greedily lines all her pockets.
Next a person unwed
Leads an army to bed
And a radical sort starts a riot,
And the chaos that reigns
Is now all that remains
Of a person once peaceful and quiet!

But the method correct
To secure and protect
From this immoral abomination
Is to catch and contain
(Though it strives for your brain)
It in poetic delineation —

In a meter and verse
It is set for the worse
And a sonnet may cage
Its iconoclast rage
For the regular motion
Of lyrical notion
Sets limits and bounds
To its chaotic rounds
And a chorus may sate
For a moment its hate
And a doggerel rhyme
Just might buy us some time
So keep poetry flowing
So all can be knowing
That we made another endeavor,

For the verse we&#39;ve amassed
Might yet trap it at last —
Though its history&#39;s long,
So is much of our song —
And, one day, might contain it forever!

**Comment:** Some whitecoat caught me spittin’ freestyle in the canteen and now I’m here.

Eggheads lockin’ down neurological sickness

Hooked up in the lab ‘cause I’m already the illest

Catching treats for the feats of my beats, so says the manager

Far above the D I could be, another integer

Look you know theys trouble when the powers that be call the LBC for an SCP

2673, you ain’t got no clout, you be jumping ‘round words, but your readings in doubt

For real you should be honored that I’m penning this rhyme, what better than a trap beat, snagged for all time!

**Comment** [[[SCP-931|Cross test]]] is approved.
More permanent containment
Is right about here

A simple rice bowl
Contains 2673
Trapping it in verse

A bit tricky though
Referring to 931
While keeping trap up

Did that last haiku
Name 2673 too
Along with rice bowl?

Repetition breach
2673 adapts
Too many haikus

----

**Date:** 09/14/2021
**Comment** That last cross-test might
Have caused a containment breach
Rectifying now

Tangled with haikus
Further adaption pending
Easing it out now

Using a rice bowl
To contain an anomaly
But it found a hole
That’s it’s toughest quality

To put on repeat
Trapped in all of the haikus
To make sure it is beat
We thought we won’t lose

But 2673
Had some lessons to teach
It found it’s way free
And caused a breach!

But we know it well
Know how to contain
It finds haikus swell
But sonnets will strain

To break out it may choose
Something that it’s apt
But there’s no more haikus
We’re sorry, you’re trapped!

Keep it in confusion
So these sonnets won’t stick
Let make another fusion
And try a limerick!

Though haikus and sonnets we strode
To find limericks on the poetry rode
Limericks are real great
Blocking 2673&#39;s hate
For this poem is also an ode

While this has been some entertainment
The objective is reaching attainment
Finish with an acrostic
Is our diagnostic
Then the subject is back in containment!

Having trapped 2673 in poems no doubt
A place that it’ll never get out
I’m finding more poems to say
Keeping the nightmare away
Under this one it’ll never adapt
So that 2673 will always be trapped!

Putting the rice bowl
Back into containment now
More cross-tests on hold

Fading is your existence

A little narrative break
I am wishing to take
For there&#39;s a desire within 
Delicious ice cream 
From the vending machine

Continuing now I realise
How very tiring
This task so demanding
I&#39;m sure this document will be waiting
For me when I awaken

So real, my dream
Action packed thrilling scenes
What I need what I crave
Cocktail of pills in a rave
Car speeding down the wrong lane

Oh no

**Comment:** Re-establishing containment

They just found him last night, clearly dead from a fight
That he could not have possibly won
Just his fists and his feet, against half of main street
Over two hundred fifty on one
With this meme in his head, he was already dead
It was over before it begun
So it&#39;s now up to me to make sure it&#39;s not free
And containing this thing isn&#39;t fun
But I&#39;ve written this verse so it doesn&#39;t get worse
I just wish I could think of a pun

**Comment:** Can someone else please take over for me? I&#39;m not a poet.

Using memory wipes as a cure
Has already been tried I am sure;
As results weren&#39;t recorded
Containment afforded
Amnestics: today&#39;s //soup du jour//

(When it&#39;s in you it&#39;s harder to think,
And make rhymes that don&#39;t utterly stink)
It just enters the head
Of the last one who read
So containment is back on the brink.

**Date:** 3/10/23
**Comments:** It&#39;s getting harder to distinguish what reality is.

Broken lines of verse
Dreaming of the ancient past
When I - //it// - was free.

Burning through my head
I have lost who I once was
Cannot re-contain.
