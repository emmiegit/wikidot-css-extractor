**A Warning**

We all have a chance somewhere
To reign eternal or just be fools 
In some corner of the skies
One house for you, one set of rules. 

//But not since the knocks.//

In the dark they saw nothing at the door
For the skies were clouded by paint 
By the time the people knew their fate
Their cries were dim and faint. 

//They were never cool.// 

The next door fell and with a cough
The bleeding king rose from his seat 
But had stumbled barely to the door 
When trampled under its feet. 

//Disease was never a virtue.//

The metal scraped and chunks united
The homes and people mixed
But iron still makes a fantastic knife
By their own hand the mechanics were nixed. 

//The pieces were never found.//

A flamethrower and an atom bomb 
Right at the invaders head 
But only the boys in blue and white 
Were stained in a moment with red. 

//They only Destroy, Destroy, Destroyed themselves.//

The readers and the freedom fighters
Saw nothing else to do
So they opened the door with a smile and a tear
Knowing at least their aim was true. 

//The library WAS a space for peaceful study.//

Greed and rage were all that lived
In old Cal and Aaron&#39;s domain 
When the skies fell and smashed on the floor
Even the Red Right Hand was slain. 

//There will be no vengeance, intermittent or otherwise.//

Our minds in the void are all that&#39;s left, 
Nothing left in our magical hats
The final hope of all that thinks
Is with you, the world of bureaucrats. 

//Are you the ones chosen to lead?//
