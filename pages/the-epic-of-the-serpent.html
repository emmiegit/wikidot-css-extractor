//The Epic of the Serpent was an epic styled as a poem composed by person(s) unknown which originated around the time of the Hand of the Serpent cult, which it found a base of popularity with. It is known for its rhyming lines and unusual word choices - some theorise this Epic as the place where the Serpent&#39;s Hand got its name.//

**Verse 1**
In lands of green and virtues true,
Where gardens sprawl and heroes too,
There always was to be a blight,
Challenging a &#34;heroic&#34; might.

When in battle rode sword and shield,
Adorned with serpents and charging field,
Fleeing foes struck by battle woes,
Serpents striking at sun-low.¹

**Verse 2**
By dawn the rumour it had spread,
Of serpent venom and thousands dead,
Mythical creatures made by God,
Struck heroes down as if just a nod.²

Kings sent their men to hunt them down,
With soldiers burning town on town,
To no avail they searched &#39;til light,
Much to the serpent&#39;s right-hands delight.

**Verse 3**
To avenge the people ruthlessly killed,
The Serpents set out over the hills,
Slaughtering soldier and causing fray,
Towers burning, stuffed with hay.

To that day the people sing,
&#34;That day they saved us from our King!&#34;
And fore&#39;er cemented in hist&#39;ry,
The hands of the serpent remains a myst&#39;ry.</textarea></pre>
