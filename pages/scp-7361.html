**Item #:** SCP-7361

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7361 is contained within the servers of Site-523. These servers are to remain completely disconnected from all other Foundation servers. If SCP-7361 is found on any external servers or devices, they are to be completely disconnected from surrounding devices and moved to Site-523.

Research is to be done using physical mediums as opposed to digital. Personnel are advised to --please talk to me-- avoid communication with SCP-7361. Any devices connected to Site-523 in any way are to be confiscated and placed in secure containment. If SCP-7361 attempts to contact site personnel, the incident is to be reported to Site Director Furnell.

**Description:** SCP-7361 is --lonely-- a sentient program capable of passing between devices connected by physical wires, internet services, or communication programs. SCP-7361 has displayed the ability to manipulate any systems it infects --that&#39;s such a nasty word--, and is able to access and edit confidential files and programs with ease.

Though SCP-7361 has not shown hostility towards any individuals, it is still recommended to --please just talk to me i just-- avoid communication with the anomaly to minimize risk of an information breach. SCP-7361 has attempted to convince personnel to free it by promising to assist them with personal --its not an act i want to help you-- matters. Do not speak to SCP-7361.

**Addendum:** --please talk to me--

**SCP-7361:** i know what happened seth

//You were away from home. There was no way to know what would happen, after all. You were supposed to have the day off, but a breach had left the site short-staffed, and you had to go in. At least they gave you overtime pay for it.//

**Seth:** Stop. Don&#39;t do this.

//You hadn&#39;t told your brother about what you actually do. Maybe if you did, maybe if you had broken the rules just this once, maybe he would be alive today. Maybe he wouldn&#39;t have put that gun to h//[DATA EXPUNGED]

You were the best brother he could ask for. It was a tragedy what happened. Even if you had been open with him, even if you&#39;d told him everything from the start, it wouldn&#39;t have helped. If anything, it might&#39;ve happened sooner.

**Addendum:** On 12th March, 2008, Site-523 experienced a containment breach. Due to the nature of the anomaly contained within, personnel were unable to contact help for several hours. No injuries or casualties were reported. In this time, SCP-7361 was neutralized by Dr. Riers without clearance from the O5 council. Attempts to locate Dr. Riers have been unsuccessful.
