__**Item #:**__ SCP-7231

__**Object Class:**__ --Keter-- ##red|Explained##

__**Special Containment Procedures:**__ Provisional Site-007 has been established to aid in the containment of SCP-7231. None of the personnel assigned to SCP-7231 are to have experienced the death of their brother.

SCP-7231 is entombed within the lowest sub-level of Provisional Site-007, approximately 77km below the surface of northern Maine. It is bound in iron chains inscribed with the [[[dust-and-blood|Daevite glyph]]] of &#34;wye&#34;.[[footnote]]Meaning &#34;sleep&#34;, &#34;rest&#34;, &#34;sadness&#34;, and &#34;grave&#34;.[[/footnote]] SCP-7231&#39;s containment area is to be routinely inspected by trained personnel for any evidence of spatial distortion or other major alterations to the area.

Additionally, SCP-7231 is contained by the daily enactment of __**Procedure-111-MONTAUK**__.

__**Procedure-111-MONTAUK:**__ The procedure consists of the flooding of SCP-7231&#39;s containment area with holy water as precisely seven priests of the Christian faith bless the area. During this time, personnel are cease all non-essential activities and --recite Document-7231-A.-- ##red|pray for his soul.## Document-7231-A is a ritualistic text derived from Daevite funeral customs and sermons given by members of the [[[christ-in-scarlet-hub|Christian Ministries of America]]].

--Dr. Robert Montauk is to be kept unaware of the existence of SCP-7231.-- ##red|No longer valid.##

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**__Description:__** SCP-7231 is the corpse of Foundation Researcher Jacob Montauk. --SCP-7231-- ##red|Jacob## has shown no signs of decay or damage ever since its initial --containment-- ##red|burial## on ██/██/████. 

--SCP-7231-- ##red|Jacob## perpetually bleeds from its hands, feet, and torso, producing approximately 7 liters of blood each day. The accumulation of this blood has been linked to several phenomena, particularly in the opening of portals to [[[SCP-6462|pocket dimensions]]] as well as damage to the local integrity of space-time. 

In addition to blood, --SCP-7231&#39;s-- ##red|Jacob&#39;s## body naturally produces extremely large amounts of --Akiva Radiation-- ##red|grief##. This energy corrupts the environment around it in highly esoteric and dangerous rituals, often causing the existence of hostile anomalous pathogens, [[[kte-2013-kapala-mendes|entities]]], and concepts. These sub-anomalies will often attempt to breach --SCP-7231&#39;s-- ##red|Jacob&#39;s## containment for an unknown, possibly ritualistic purpose. Although such an effect points to the existence of a greater intelligence, --SCP-7231-- ##red|Jacob## has been empirically proven to --not be conscious.-- ##red|be deceased.##

Although containment of these effects has been largely successful with the advent of **__Procedure-111-MONTAUK__**, the efficacy of the containment rituals have been decreasing ever since ██/██/████. Containment of --SCP-7231-- ##red|Jacob## has caused increasingly more casualties and expense for the Foundation. Efforts to find alternate containment methods are ongoing. 

 --SCP-7231-- ##red|Jacob## gained its anomalous properties following its death on ██/██/████. The exact manner of  --SCP-7231-- ##red|Jacob&#39;s## death is unknown, but it is believed to have been non-anomalous in nature. However, notably, the containment of  --SCP-7231-- ##red|Jacob## coincided with the discovery of [[[SCP-231]]] and GoI-586 (&#34;Children of the ##red|Scarlet King##&#34;). It is unknown if this is significant in any way.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;background-color: red;&#34;]]
&gt; Jacob,
&gt; 
&gt; It&#39;s been a while ever since that day. Since I cradled your broken body as your warm blood mingled with the cold concrete and I howled my grief to the uncaring skies. You were the one that died that day, but so did I, in a way.
&gt; 
&gt; So, I threw myself into work. I contained doomsday cults, horrific monsters, and ... yes, even that poor girl. I poured all my hatred and vehemence at a world that allowed you to be killed into the Scarlet King. This disgusting, twisted God that //must// have been responsible for the cruelty that took you away from me. I hated Him with every fiber of my being and endowed Him with all the evil in the world. I made Him my Devil. I swore to hurt Him however I could. I became as monstrous as I believed Him to be. All because I couldn&#39;t accept that my brother was really dead.
&gt; 
&gt; But now that I see this monster they&#39;ve made of you, this //thing// that needs to be contained and locked up like some common aberration, I know that I was wrong. It was not the King that killed you. It was life. It was the meaningless twisting of fate that broke my heart. And what I&#39;ve been doing isn&#39;t right. The King is a mindless thing, not even capable of consciousness, but when I blamed Him for you, I gave Him shape within your body. I gave Him form. I made you into the monster.
&gt; 
&gt;  I need to let you go. To give you rest. I&#39;ll come back one day to put some red flowers on your grave.
&gt; 
&gt; Your big brother loves you.
&gt; 
&gt; ~ Robert Montauk
