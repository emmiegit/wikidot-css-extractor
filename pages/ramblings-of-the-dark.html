This is a supplementary tale for the amazing Nightfall canon. The rest of the stories are on display.

Thank you to [[*user MoreMuffins]] for going over this skip.
[[include :scp-wiki:info:end]]

Jacob Sanders was born on a gloomy, shrouded night , in the town of Camabar, at the outskirts of Xerophylla. From when he was young, he was always a weird child. He rambled on about weird creatures in his room, about a shrouded face full of hate peering at his town from the sky. He would go outside and pick the leaves from trees, dip them in ink, and then let the wind blow them away. His family thought he was mad, psychotic, perhaps. They paid their life savings to get him to a doctor, some type of mental ward. But he was never diagnosed with anything. They were forced to stop and let him live his life normally, whatever //normally// was for him.

Growing up, he found himself entangled with occult groups all over the country, mostly because he was curious enough to enter their proximity. He eventually settled on the Foundation, the group tasked with destroying the unknown that plagued the world. He was highly valued due to his abilities. Especially because he could peer through the night to the weirdest of the weird, those that lurked in the darkest corners of existence. But he still felt like something was missing. He didn’t share his peers ‘s ambitious ideals. He did not want to murder God, because he knew the price would be far worse than what they had prepared for. They had become overconfident. They thought they were gods. The light of Xerophylla had slowly dimmed over time to give its place to the darkness of the Foundation. And he couldn’t leave, because the Foundation was his gateway to the only hope he ever had of being “normal”. 

At the last sunset, he watched the sun dip into the horizon. And as he did, he realised what was missing from his life. The night. The creatures he’d been seeing in his room since he was young, the face that looked down on his town with hate. They were all offsprings of Yvith, of the night. He was The Child of the Night, the one blessed to lead the subjects of Yvith.

At the first hour after [[[Embers|Nightfall]]], he assumed control. They all followed him blindly, empty shells of their former selves, as they were. Mindless spectres, wandering the streets of Xerophylla without aim and purpose. He taught them of Yvith ‘s ways, of his deeper secrets. He taught them of magic stolen from the deepest circles of Hell. He organised his army, and set to a campaign to drown the Foundation in the dark.

Their operations were successful. They plunged riches, stole information, ravaged facilities and pillaged their weapons. They were the leading force in this world of eternal night, and they were always one step ahead of everybody else. They had condensed their collective will into a sword, one that could cut through the night itself, and give its place to the dazzling gleam. They had made a weapon against themselves. He knew it was the last existing remnant of the humanity that was still left in the hearts of the undead. They hid it safely, in a secure bunker underground, protected by the most complex spells of the occult circles. No one dared to infiltrate, and no one dared to oppose them.

And so, they prospered in the night, pleading the sun would never rise again.
