**Item #:** SCP-2945

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2945 is stored in a standard containment unit at Site-49. Testing with SCP-2945 is not to be authorized without express permission from Site-49 administration.

**Description:** SCP-2945 is a 4-port USB hub designed in a humanoid shape, similar to novelty USB products commonly manufactured for public sale. The object is blue in coloration and consists of 4 female A-type USB ports, which serve as the object&#39;s hands and feet, connected by adjustable appendages to a central torso. A cable ending in a male A-type USB connector is attached to SCP-2945&#39;s head to allow for connection to USB-compatible power sources. No branding or label is present on the object with the exception of small white text on the back of SCP-2945&#39;s torso reading: &#34;USB ██.0 (Beta)&#34;.

SCP-2945&#39;s anomalous effects will occur only while in a powered state. When an external hardware device is plugged into any one of SCP-2945&#39;s USB ports, the individual doing so will exhibit one or a number of anomalous effects depending on the type of connected device and which of SCP-2945&#39;s extremities the device is plugged into. Multiple simultaneous effects have been proven possible if the individual connects more than one device to SCP-2945. The effect(s) last until the external device(s) are disconnected or SCP-2945 is disconnected from its power source.

Testing of SCP-2945 was conducted on 12/23/20██ shortly following its discovery. SCP-2945 was placed in a 5m x 5m x 3m testing chamber and connected via a 3 meter USB extension cable to a compatible power source within an observation room. Individual D-Class subjects were instructed to enter the chamber with a prepared electronic device which, when prompted by appointed Researcher Gittins, they were to plug into a designated port on SCP-2945.

|| **Subject** || **External device** || **USB port used** || **Result** || **Addendum** ||
|| D-6789, 45-year-old male (Test 2945-01) || A color inkjet printer || Right hand || Subject exhibited the ability to imprint color images onto any surface with his right hand. It is believed that images produced are projections of the subject&#39;s current field of vision. No traces of any substance were found on subject&#39;s hand. || Subject&#39;s last printed images were increasingly discolored and faded. Subject appeared exhausted and pale before eventually losing consciousness. Testing was concluded and subject was sent for medical evaluation.[[footnote]]Medical staff reported D-6789 as suffering from the combined loss of approx. 30% blood and body water. It is thought that the two substances were used to create the printed images, however the method by which this process occurred is not yet known.[[/footnote]] ||
|| D-9754, 21-year-old male (Test 2945-03) || A ███████-brand cell phone charging cable (Subject was also provided with 4 rechargeable electronic devices but was ordered to not attach them to the charging cable.) || Left foot || The electronic devices entered a charging state upon contact with any part of subject&#39;s bare left foot. Breaking contact with the device immediately ceased the effect. || Subject reported feeling noticeably &#34;rejuvenated&#34; concluding testing. ||
|| D-8635, 38-year-old female (Test 2945-06) || A 1GB USB flash drive containing the song //Cars// by Gary Numan || Left hand || The song began playing immediately with the subject&#39;s ears appearing to act as loudspeakers. Subject had the ability to control the song&#39;s playback with the movements of her left hand. (Close/open fist = pause/play song; Curl in thumb = rewind; Curl in index finger = fast forward; Curl in middle finger = increase volume; Curl in ring finger = decrease volume; Curl in little finger = no effect[[footnote]]A slight decrease in volume occurred, however this is likely due to the ring finger&#39;s tendency to flex along with the little finger.[[/footnote]]) || Subject stated that the audio was in the best quality she had ever heard, later expressing growing discontent with the &#34;inferior&#34; sound quality of normal sounds. Several requests for further usage of SCP-2945 have since been denied. ||
|| D-3233, 26-year-old male (Test 2945-08) || A ██████-brand instant digital camera || Right foot || Small flashes of light were emitted from an unknown source whenever subject blinked. A large wide slit opened up on the sole of the right foot, causing great distress to the subject. 8 seconds later a small instant photograph, approximately the size of a credit card, was expelled from the wound, developing fully in the space of 5 seconds. An additional 9 photographs followed in quick succession. Similar to Test 2945-01, the instant photographs depicted the subject&#39;s field of vision. When SCP-2945 was disconnected, the wound had instantaneously healed without leaving a scar. Subject was sent for medical examination. || Subject described the experience as painless but distressing. Medical examination of subject&#39;s right foot provided no explanation for how the photographs were created, but showed significant atrophy of the plantar fascia tissue. Research into a possible correlation between the tissue and the material of the photographs is ongoing. ||
|| D-7366, 34-year-old male (Test 2945-09) || A USB microphone; a USB webcam || Right foot (microphone); Right hand (webcam) || Subject stared at his right palm and claimed that he could &#34;see himself&#34; through unknown means that caused visible distress. Subject also reported hearing low rumbling sounds in his ears, described as &#34;vibrations&#34;. After approximately 3 minutes, subject suddenly covered his ears and screamed. Testing was concluded. || In questioning, D-7366 claimed to have heard a sudden loud screeching sound, which may have been feedback noise due to subject&#39;s proximity with the connected microphone at the time. Subject could only stammer while attempting to verbally describe his experience of seeing with his palm. ||
|| D-9163, 22-year-old female (Test 2945-10) || A ██████-brand digital television, connected to SCP-2945 via a HDMI-to-USB adapter || Left foot || Subject&#39;s personality, behavior and voice changed immediately, becoming those of American actor David Hyde Pierce&#39;s character of Niles Crane from the sitcom //Frasier//, and behaved as though acting in the show. This lasted for 5 seconds before abruptly changing to another persona, being that of British adventurer Bear Grylls. Subject continuously changed personalities and behavior every 2-5 seconds until SCP-2945 was unplugged from its power source. || It is theorized that the subject&#39;s left foot was capable of &#34;changing channels&#34; involuntarily, explaining the sudden persona changes. It is also worth noting that the connected television did not deviate from the &#34;NO INPUT SIGNAL&#34; screen it displayed. When questioned, D-9163 claimed she could not recall her behavior, but described a number of disjointed memories such as &#34;visiting my father Martin&#34; and &#34;Chef Ramsay not liking my signature dish&#34;. Subject appeared confused but unaware that her memories were those of television personalities and fictional characters. ||

SCP-2945 was discovered in ██████████, Vermont, at the home of 32-year-old O█████ Svennson, who was reported as missing on 12/21/20██. A trail of printed images in the shape of left footprints became a major clue in the investigation. The trail led down █████ Street and towards a nearby wood before abruptly ending. Traces of an unknown multicolored substance visually resembling matte paint were also found along the trail. Local authorities conducted a widespread search over a 50km radius from where the trail terminated; however, Svennson&#39;s body remains unaccounted for.

Several residents of █████ Street where Svennson&#39;s trail was found reported hearing music at a loud volume outside their homes for a short period of time on the night of the disappearance. T███ ████████, a close relative of Svennson, also gave an account to the police. She stated that Svennson has recently been &#34;acting weird, like he&#39;d seen some serious shit, like, fucked-up serious&#34;. She goes on to say that his paranoid behavior gradually increased until his disappearance.

An embedded Foundation agent discovered the human-shaped USB hub connected to Svennson&#39;s home computer, noting that a printer was linked to the object&#39;s left foot. The hub was also connected to an internet modem, a fully-charged Apple iPod and a Wacom graphics tablet. Establishing a connection between the attached devices and the circumstances of Svennson&#39;s trail, the USB hub was confiscated by the Foundation, with further testing being required to grant the object SCP classification.
