//But anomalous people are people, and the anomalous itself is not a threat merely for existing.//

...

//You are the monsters you are so afraid of. Let go of your fear, and join us in the light.//

//And if you will not… if you keep imprisoning and killing innocents, if you keep forcing the world to stay in the dark… then you will meet the fate of all the slavers and murderers in the worlds&#39; history before you.//

+ **&gt; Premise &lt;**

Life is hell for humanoid anomalies.

They are stolen from their life of freedom, with any knowledge of their existence being erased from the minds of their friends and family. They are dragged to an unfamiliar, concrete research facility, where their abilities are prodded and test. They are put in orange jumpsuits, have their name replaced with numbers, and given a 10 by 10 cell to wither away in.

They are prisoners.

The O5 don&#39;t care about their suffering. The Ethics Committee is corrupt beyond saving. Doctors see humanoid skips as resources. MTF agents are required to be prejudice and dehumanizing.

But not everyone within the Foundation is as heartless as the researchers of Site-17. There are those whose compassion and empathy outweigh their lust for cheating at life.

There are 2 factions within the SCP Foundation. One sees skips as tools. One sees skips as people. These 2 factions cannot co-exist. Sooner or later... there will be blood.

++ Update 2: CSS Boogaloo

[[&lt;]]
//DrDapper... didn&#39;t you just make an update post talking about how BASALT was the new theme for North Star?//

Yeah yeah, I hear ya... but here&#39;s thing about me...

I&#39;m the kind of person who dusts off his hands saying &#34;job well done&#34; after making and posting something. I then proceed to go to sleep, wake up the next morning, look over what I made, and say &#34;oh my god what was I thinking?&#34;

Yeah, after looking over the hub and articles, I decided that BASALT wasn&#39;t for me. No offense to the creator, it really is a good theme... it just really doesn&#39;t reflect the atmosphere I want North Star to have.

So, now I&#39;m using [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:jakstyle Jakstyle] (thanks [[*user JakdragonX]]). This should hopefully be the one I keep, but if it isn&#39;t... I&#39;ll see you in the next update post.

PS: This is also a dark themed... uh... theme, so you can read my articles at night without flash-banging yourself now. You&#39;re fucking welcome.

++ Quality of Life Overhaul/Where Have I Been?

[[&lt;]]
Hello everyone, been a while huh? I know what you&#39;re thinking.

//Dapper... what the hell am I looking at and where the hell have you been?//

Let&#39;s start with addressing that first question: the theme change.

So I learned that CSS is actually really flexible when it comes to customization, more so than I originally thought. Not only that, but you don&#39;t need a PhD in computer programing to operate it. So, I said fuck it, and made my own theme...

...

....well ok, not MAKE my own theme. I&#39;m using the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:basalt BASALT] theme as a base. I did change the SCP logo and header, but that&#39;s about it. So yeah, this is going to be the official theme or North Star, get used to it. Also, I made different headers for each Phase (formerly referred to as Parts).

Question number 2: where have I been?

Short answer: [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/broken-masquerade-hub Broken Masquerade].

Long answer: Drafting up a tale for Broken Masquerade in my sandbox. No, I haven&#39;t posted it. No, it isn&#39;t done. No, it isn&#39;t close to being done. No, I didn&#39;t give up.

Basically, I hit a massive writers block following SCP-6303... at least for North Star. I had an idea for BM that I wanted to at least jot down... so I did. I worked on the BM tale while thinking up ways to continue NS. Good news is the wheels are finally starting to turn again. The BM tale is on the backburner while I chug forward with NS. Hopefully that answers your question.

This was a pretty short update log, which I DO plan on using in the future. I won&#39;t post here often, only if I need to make a PSA or anything. Anyway, thank you guys for sticking with me. See ya in the next one!

++ The SCP Foundation

The SCP Foundation is evil, plain and simple. They murder, torture, kidnap, and abuse; all in the name of the vaguely defined &#39;greater good.&#39; While there are lines they won&#39;t cross, they aren&#39;t above exploiting SCPs (including humanoids) to maintain the status quo.

------

++ The Ethics Committee

The Ethics Committee, much like the Foundation as a whole, is rotten to the core with corruption. Members will turn a blind eye to unethical and immoral practices if it means they themselves can benefit. It also isn&#39;t nearly as influential as it should be.

------

++ The Chaos Insurgency

The Chaos Insurgency believe the Ethics Committee&#39;s restrictions and Foundation bureaucrats are holding humanity back from greatness. Unlike the Serpent&#39;s Hand, who merely want to assimilate anomalies into daily life, the Insurgency seeks to make mankind a race of gods. They also aren&#39;t above using or treating anomalies in an inhumane way.

Delta-4 is an extreme rapid response task force. Their duty is to get someplace fast, evacuate civilians, and establish a perimeter. They also provide additional manpower to other MTFs present, helping them with general tasks (such as escort and extract). It has the highest causality rate of any task force

++ Omega-7 (&#34;Pandora&#39;s Box&#34;)

Omega-7 is the first task force to utilize humanoid anomalies. Specifically, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-076 SCP-076-2] and [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-105 SCP-105]. They&#39;re usually only called in when a situation gets out of hand. Although Omega-7 is only used to counter anomalous events and creatures, there are many pushing for Pandora&#39;s Box to be used against GoIs.

------

++ Omega-1 (&#34;Law&#39;s Left Hand&#34;)

[[image https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/472222098090098688/935239457790103593/dcwyfvh-280425e7-56c5-4d3f-93a1-5019b7124f04.png width=&#34;200px&#34;]]

Omega-1 acts as the Ethics Committee&#39;s personal task force. Mostly made up of detectives, Omega-1 investigates potential ethical violations and inhumane practices. It also has a spec ops branch for when they need to enforce the Committee&#39;s restrictions. Despite having one of the most important tasks in the Foundation, Omega-1 is sorely underfunded and understaffed.
