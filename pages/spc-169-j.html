**Item #:** [[[scp-169|SPC-169]]]

**Object Class:** Megalodon

**Shark Punching Contingencies:** Due to its immense size, direct punching of SPC-169 will prove impractical. As such, Project Ahab has been established for the full-scale pugilization of SPC-169. 

Project Ahab consists of simultaneous Dreadnought-class punchery from five separate sources in the southern Atlantic Ocean:

# **Ahab-1 &#34;Fist of Neptune&#34;:** 50 satellites currently located in stationary orbit over critical points of SPC-169&#39;s anatomy. These satellites are capable of releasing 100kg tungsten-osmium sculptures of fists into Earth&#39;s atmosphere, which will use the natural acceleration of Earth&#39;s gravity to punch SPC-169 at terminal velocity.
# **Ahab-2 &#34;Fist of Triton&#34;:** Ten volleys of 20 intercontinental ballistic missiles modified for shark-punching purposes with Kaiju-grade Doomfist tips.
# **Ahab-3 &#34;Fist of Calypso&#34;:** Two-stage operation in which Megara-277EA92R (a van-sized asteroid in an L4 orbit around the Earth) is 1. implanted with several boxing gloves, and 2. magnetized directly onto SPC-169.
# **Ahab-4 &#34;Fist of Cthulhu&#34;:** 500 modified drilling rigs will be installed on the exterior of SPC-169 for the purpose of applying continuous punching action over the course of several years.
# **Ahab-5 &#34;Fist of Nemo&#34;:** [DATA EXPUNGED] will be trained in bareknuckle boxing techniques and summoned to challenge SPC-169 to fisticuffs.

**Description:** SPC-169 is the largest shark ever encountered by the Shark Punching Center, believed to be between 2,000 and 8,000 km in length. Radar analysis has detected a hardened outer carapace, indications of a state of dormancy, and, unfortunately, a complete lack of exterior indications of punching. SPC-169 is believed to have existed since the Pre-Cambrian era. Due to the ethical ramifications of a shark having remained unpunched for that long, Project Ahab is to be executed as soon as possible.

**Addendum 1 - Shark Identification Discrepancies:**
&gt; &lt;Begin Log&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Swayze:** Sir, we have reason to believe that SPC-169 is not a shark.
&gt; 
&gt; **Administrator:** Explain.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Swayze:** SPC-169 has an exoskeleton, as well as multiple sets of limbs and feelers. In truth, I believe SPC-169 is a very large arthropod.
&gt; 
&gt; **Administrator:** Interesting. Tell me, is SPC-169 located in the ocean?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Swayze:** Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Administrator:** Is it larger than a dolphin?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Swayze:** [Audible sigh] Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Administrator:** Does it have lots of pointy parts that could potentially be dangerous? Then it&#39;s a shark! This is entry-level sharkspotting; you really should know better at this point.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Swayze:** Sir, with all due respect: by that logic, sperm whales, orcas, and narwhals could also be called &#34;sharks&#34;.
&gt; 
&gt; **Administrator:** ...oh God, no.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;End Log&gt;

Following this meeting, an emergency initiative was established for the investigation and immediate punching of SPC-170 (&#34;Moby Dick Sharks&#34;), SPC-171 (&#34;Free Willy Sharks&#34;), and [[[spc-172-j|SPC-172 (&#34;Sword Sharks?!&#34;)]]].

**Addendum 2 - Ethics Committee Review:**
&gt; &lt;Begin Log&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Balboa:** We&#39;ve been going over the agenda for Project Ahab, and I think we need to step up the lethality.
&gt; 
&gt; **Administrator:** On what grounds?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Balboa:** If we were to punch this... shark, and we did not kill it, I&#39;m fairly certain its enraged awakening would potentially cause irreversible damage to human civilization.
&gt; 
&gt; **Administrator:** But would it be punched?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Balboa:** The human race would go extinct, but yes, SPC-169 would be punched.
&gt; 
&gt; **Administrator:** Look, whatever the fine print says, our job is done once the fist is in the shark&#39;s bitch face. Forgive me if I fail to see how the most punchable shark in our organization&#39;s history is generating so much nitpicking.
