**Item #:** SCP-5696

**Object Class:** --Safe-- Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5696 is kept in anomalous item locker #5696 at Site-19. 
No further procedures are considered necessary.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+Initial Containment Procedures+&#34; hide=&#34;-Close Procedures-&#34;]]

Prior to entering SCP-5696-A, subjects are to be given a button camera fashioned to look like a pin supporting William H. Thompson for the 1931 Chicago Mayoral Election. The camera should be placed on the subject&#39;s left lapel after entering SCP-5696-A. During the displacement of SCP-5696-1 into SCP-5696-A, the SCP-5696 testing chamber is to be monitored for their return. 
[[/collapsible]]

**Description:** SCP-5696 refers to a revolver resembling a Smith and Wesson M&amp;P .38 in both function and design. The weapon bears two engravings: The first being a manufacturer engraving along the cylinder reading &#34;S&amp;W Model EO-11 C.S.&#34; [[footnote]] No such model has ever been produced.[[/footnote]] and the second on one side of the barrel reading &#34;Finish this job, Kill that cheating bastard.&#34; When SCP-5696 is held in the right hand of a subject and the cylinder is opened using that hand, the subject (henceforth SCP-5696-1) will be displaced into SCP-5696-A. [[footnote]] This is no longer the case following Test 5696-129. [[/footnote]]

SCP-5696-A refers to an alternate dimension consisting primarily of a nightclub named &#34;The Dying Roses,&#34; a building that was once located at ███ Division St., Chicago, which closed in 1956. Displaced subjects will find themselves dressed in formal attire appropriate for the early 1930&#39;s regardless of what they were dressed in prior to displacement. This includes a striped suit and matching dress pants, a blue tie, white undershirt, and a striped fedora. All objects on their person will have demanifested until their return, where they will find themselves dressed in the same clothes they were originally relocated in and possessing the same belongings. Note that SCP-5696-1 will displace with one, five, and ten dollar bills in varying amounts, totaling up to $100, in their left inner coat pocket.[[footnote]]Note that due to inflation, this would be worth $1,550 - $1,890.[[/footnote]] No items can be brought out of or taken into SCP-5696-A with the exception of any object held in SCP-5696-1&#39;s left hand during their removal from our dimension. Displacement does not occur with subjects that have damaged or abnormal vision, amputees, have disorders outside of general depression disorders, are shorter than 5&#39;11&#34; or taller than 6&#39;2&#34;, or a BMI of under 20.2 or above 24.7. 

When viewed upon immediate entry, the area surrounding &#34;The Dying Roses&#34; consists of empty space. SCP-5696-A will construct an environment dependent on the needs or requirements of SCP-5696-1. This usually begins as SCP-5696-A constructing a cityscape of apartment buildings but has also included rival clubs, hospitals, fire stations, police stations, etc. SCP-5696-A also creates smaller objects as they are needed such as telephone poles, call boxes, motor vehicles, etc.

During their shift into SCP-5696-A, the subject will experience a series of semi-predictable events. Events that occur can have varying outcomes or be prevented entirely based on the actions taken by SCP-5696-1 while in SCP-5696-A. In some cases, actions taken have led to notable and/or unusual events occurring. None of the events are particularly anomalous, rather they come together to form a continuous story within that shift. 

The following details the most commonly-recorded series of events.


&gt; **00:00 - 1:00:** SCP-5696-1 will be ushered to a seat at the bar as they &#34;wait for the rest of their party,&#34; [[footnote]] This is also often recorded as &#34;wait for Mr. Jackson and his friends,&#34; as well as &#34;wait for your friend and the others.&#34; [[/footnote]] although subjects may do as they please. Subjects have been recorded as having ordered food and drinks[[footnote]] Despite evidence suggesting the events take place during the later part of the prohibition era, the beverages often contain alcohol. [[/footnote]], purchasing cigars or cigarettes, interacting with waitstaff and other customers, speaking with and/or paying stage dancers, and in some cases, engaging in hand-to-hand combat.[[footnote]] This usually occurs due to subjects &#34;catcalling&#34; certain dancers whose husbands are in the establishment.[[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **1:01 - 1:45:** Five men (SCP-5696-2, -3, -4, -5, -6) will enter the establishment over the course of 45 minutes and mill about the area. They most-commonly spend this time sitting next to each other at the bar and ordering various drinks. Each of them will eventually begin to smoke and talk among themselves. 
&gt; 
&gt; **1:46 - 1:59:** SCP-5696-2 through -6 will enter a room at the far end of the establishment that is closed off by a pair of red curtains. SCP-5696-1 will be ushered into the room by a member of the waitstaff and will be introduced to the men as &#34;Mark Kennedy of the C.P.D.[[footnote]] Chicago Police Department.[[/footnote]] He&#39;s here on behalf of Nitti&#39;s gang.&#34;[[footnote]] This likely refers to Frank Nitti, de-facto leader of The Chicago Outfit following Al Capone&#39;s arrest in 1931.[[/footnote]] They will stare at SCP-5696-1 in silence for roughly five seconds before laughing and shaking their hand. SCP-5696-5 will offer SCP-5696-1 a cigarette if they don&#39;t already have one and the member of waitstaff will offer them a drink. SCP-5696-5 will show them to an open seat around a table covered in green felt. 
&gt; 
&gt; **2:00 - 6:00:** SCP-5696-1 through -6 will begin to play Texas Hold &#39;em using direct monetary bets. From here, similarities become less common and the timeline of events begins to differ due to subject input. Play styles, game outcomes, conversation topics, and general actions influence what occurs.

**Addendum 5696-2:** List of Notable Discrepancies

&gt; **Test #:** 03
&gt; **Time:** 1:20
&gt; **Event:** A female test subject was used. SCP-5696-1 was removed from the building for &#34;impersonating Mr. Kennedy. She even wore his fucking clothes.&#34; SCP-5696-A was viewed forming a full cityscape. SCP-5696-1 spent the remainder of the time in the parking lot and wandering through the streets of SCP-5696-A. 

&gt; **Test #:** 24
&gt; **Time:** 5:00
&gt; **Event:** SCP-5696-1 repeatedly bet all money on their person.[[footnote]] This is often considered rude or unsportsmanlike.[[/footnote]] SCP-5696-3 punched SCP-5696-1, knocking them unconscious. 

&gt; **Test #:** 27
&gt; **Time:** 3:25
&gt; **Event:** Two thieves attempted to rob the nightclub at gunpoint. Every patron and member of the waitstaff drew a firearm on the thieves, including SCP-5696-1. They left peacefully.

&gt; [[Skipping to designated event portion. A full transcription may be requested from Dr. Patra, lead researcher for SCP-5696.]]
&gt;&gt; **4:59** //SCP-5696-1 has been looking at SCP-5696-5 on and off over the course of the last 10 minutes.//
&gt; **SCP-5696-5:** Okay, what&#39;s wrong, kid? Something on my face?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5696-1:** No, I just can&#39;t help but notice that what you lack in beauty, you seem to be making up for in card skills. Try letting us win some hands, you might have more fun.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5696-5:** Hey I&#39;m sorry god&#39;s been wanting me to have your money! I can&#39;t help that.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5696-1:** Uh huh, yeah, I&#39;m sure that&#39;s what&#39;s going on.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **5:03** //SCP-5696-1 folds his current hand, then stands.//
&gt; **SCP-5696-1:** Gents, I&#39;m going to take a piss.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //SCP-5696-1 walks around the left side of the table, despite this being a longer route to the room&#39;s exit.//
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **5:04** //SCP-5696-1 removes the pin and sets it on the table by SCP-5696-5.//
&gt; **SCP-5696-1:** Hold on to this for me, will ya.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5696-5:** What, giving up politics, kid? Whatever. Hey while you&#39;re in there, do me a favor and go fuck yourself too. 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **5:04 - 5:09** //SCP-5696-1 spends five minutes presumably in the bathroom. Note that SCP-5696-5 is recorded removing cards from his current hand and replacing them with cards from his coat via sleight of hand, twice.//
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **5:10** //SCP-5696-1 returns and places the pin over his left breast again. SCP-5696-1 shoots SCP-5696-5 through the sternum before turning the gun on SCP-5696-6.//
&gt; **SCP-5696-1:** You dirty, cheating bastard! He&#39;s been swapping cards for the last ten hands. Watch this!
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //SCP-5696-1 kneels down over SCP-5696-5, who is alive but bleeding profusely. He removes SCP-5696-5&#39;s coat and holds it upside-down, shaking it twice. Cards flutter and fall out of the sleeves and pockets. SCP-5696-2 leaves the room unnoticed.//
&gt; **SCP-5696-6:** Jesus Christ, Jake..
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **5:11** //Shouting comes from outside of the room.//
&gt; **SCP-5696-2:** THE ROSE IS DYING! THIS IS THE CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT, YOU&#39;RE ALL UNDER ARREST FOR VIOLATION OF THE 18th AMM-
&gt; **Unknown:** EAT SHIT AND LEAD, PIG!
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //SCP-5696-1 runs for the room&#39;s exit and steps through the curtains. Half of the patrons are running for an exit while the other half have begun flipping tables and firing handguns in the direction of the bar, including SCP-5696-2. The waitstaff have taken cover under the bar and are firing into the tables.//
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //Note that the remaining patrons have removed their jackets, revealing CPD badges on their undershirts.//
&gt; **SCP-5696-1:** Holy Fuck!
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //SCP-5696-1 dives behind a table next to another patron.//
&gt; **Patron:** Tough crowd huh, Mr. Kennedy!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5696-1:** Understatement of the century! Hey, help me get the hell out of here! I&#39;d like to be alive when they interview me!
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **5:12** //Two members of the waitstaff run out of the door to the back room and duck under the bar. They open fire using Remington Model-31 shotguns.//
&gt; **Patron:** Ah, shit, yeah, okay! I&#39;ll cover you, get to the back exit!
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //The patron gestures behind him.//
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //SCP-5696-1 readies himself for a moment before sprinting towards the back exit. SCP-5696-1 screams, falls and turns around. SCP-5696-6 stands at the other end of the room, aiming a handgun at SCP-5696-1. The patron aims around the table and shoots SCP-5696-6 through the left eye. A member of waitstaff blasts the patron&#39;s hand off with a shotgun round.//
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //SCP-5696-1 turns his left leg over, revealing a gunshot wound in the upper calf. SCP-5696-1 regains his footing and limps out of the exit, throws off his coat and wraps his leg in his undershirt.//
&gt; **SCP-5696-1:** Fuck..
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **5:13-5:15** //SCP-5696-1 limps down the alleyway towards a police call box, attempting to put his coat back on. SCP-5696-1 opens the box and removes the telephone.//
&gt; **Operator:** Hello, officer. Name and badge number.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5696-1:** Officer Mark Kennedy, uh, fuck me..
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //SCP-5696 fires in SCP-5696-1&#39;s right pants pocket, presumably shooting the ground. SCP-5696-1 removes SCP-5696 and turns it over. The engraving on SCP-5696&#39;s barrel reads &#34;1017.&#34;//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5696-1:** Officer Mark Kennedy, Badge Number 1017! I&#39;m in need of immediate assistance, I&#39;ve been shot in the back of the leg at The Dying Roses. We may need backup in there. Fucking hell.
&gt; 
&gt; **Operator:** Understood, putting out an urgent call to other officers in the area. Please wait there.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //The operator hangs up the phone.//
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **5:15-5:17** //SCP-5696-1 sits on the ground against the phone post in silence, trying to keep his leg raised.//
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **5:17** //A white Model-B Ford arrives and two others drive past. SCP-5696-1 is loaded into the passenger seat by an unseen figure.//
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **5:17 - 5:59** //The figure is dressed in the same clothing as SCP-5696-1 and possesses a similar build. The figure smiles weakly, then begins driving. Note that the figure had a bullet wound in his upper-right chest which appeared to puncture the heart, but was not bleeding. SCP-5696-1 turns to look out the window, then removes the pin and holds it against the glass. The vehicle drives past a line of other iterations of The Dying Roses, most of which are identical in nature. The figure chuckles quietly. One of the locations appears to have been burnt down.//
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //The figure stops in front of what appears to be the Rush University Medical Center. The figure enters the hospital and four members of the medical staff run out to the car with a stretcher five minutes later. SCP-5696-1 is carried out of the car and into the hospital. Medical staff removed the jacket and no relevant video was captured until SCP-5696-1&#39;s return into our reality.//
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **6:00** //SCP-5696-1 is returned holding the pin and possessing an improperly-cauterized wound. Marker marks made along SCP-5696-1&#39;s lower leg imply that SCP-5696-A&#39;s medical staff intended to amputate the leg. SCP-5696-1 received proper medical care and made a full recovery.//

&gt; **Test #:** 128
&gt; **Time:** 0:05
&gt; **Event:** The engraving on SCP-5696&#39;s barrel was not present. The interior of &#34;The Dying Roses&#34; was significantly darkened and contained only one person. A spotlight was aimed at a patron dressed in similar clothing and possessing a similar physique to SCP-5696-1, who was sitting at the bar. The figure possessed a CPD badge which he wore openly on his suit. He smiled weakly at SCP-5696-1 and offered them a shot glass filled with scotch. SCP-5696-1 noted that the area felt abnormally cold, but was warmer in the light. The subject and the figure held a toast, then sat in silence for 10-15 seconds. The figure stood, removed his badge and firearm and placed them on the counter, then turned to leave. He stopped at the door, turned to face SCP-5696-1, thanked them, then left the establishment. The subject spent the remainder of the time in the empty building. 

&gt; **Test #:** 129
&gt; **Time:** 0:00
&gt; **Event:** SCP-5696 did not displace the subject. The engraving on the side of the barrel read &#34;Mark Kennedy, 1908-2020.&#34;
