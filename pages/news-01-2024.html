The Korean SCP Branch is currently running its [[[http://scpko.wikidot.com/blood-donation-department-3| Third Annual Blood Drive]]]! This blood drive involves donating blood and sending the blood donor card to the Korean Association For Children with Leukemia &amp; Cancer, which the Korean Branch has partnered with. The first blood drive managed to collect approximately 80,000mL of blood, and the second campaign gathered over 570,000mL of blood! We encourage you to help out and visit a blood donation location near you!

What a long, strange year it&#39;s been, hasn&#39;t it?

2023 was a relatively quiet year for the wiki, as we did not have a K-con during it, but that doesn&#39;t mean there weren&#39;t great articles to be found! In this editorial, I, Uncle Nicolini, will lay out 12 of my personal favorite articles, one for each month, in the hopes that you will check them out and enjoy them as well. Without further ado, let&#39;s begin!

++++ January

[[[The Nuclear Option]]] started the year out with a bang. With its tight, deliberate, and intense prose, every word is calculated to deliver the maximum effect. At roughly 2,000 words, it&#39;s short and packs quite the punch.

++++ February

[[[The Boltmann Ambush]]] is one in the ongoing series of Parawatch True Crime creepypastas. It has just enough verisimilitude to make it seem plausible and the right amount of spooky. What more could someone ask out of a creepypasta?

++++ March

[[[dr-anderson-s-failing-marriage|Dr. Anderson&#39;s Failing Marriage]]] is a story about a man who&#39;s love life has become so routine, he no longer feels any passion about it. But when the Foundation assigns him to work on a new anomaly that could possibly help save his marriage, will he jump on the opportunity? I guess you&#39;ll have to read it to find out!

++++ April

[[[SCP-332]]] is an article about refusing to let go of the past, no matter how stupid it is. The twist at the end is also very unexpected and interesting; a great decision made by the author to illustrate some people&#39;s stubbornness in clinging to the past.

++++ May

[[[SCP-7422]]] is an introspective piece about the nonbinary experience in a world of ones and zeros. It&#39;s not your standard SCP article, but the use of prose throughout accentuates the feeling of not quite fitting in. It&#39;s also the author&#39;s first article; a very strong first showing that leaves me hungry for more.

++++ June

[[[Red Plague Rid You for Learning Me Your Language]]] is a piece about a pathetic man living his pathetic life after being rejected by another man. The prose is excellent throughout and it makes you both feel bad and feel amused at just how much of a failson Jude is. Excellent work all around.

++++ July

[[[Taking The Reinz]]] is a story about an insurance salesman. Doesn&#39;t sound interesting, right? Well, you&#39;d be dead wrong there. Taking The Reinz is a thriller full of interesting characters, intrigue, and unusual whimsy that is sure to entice you. Highly recommend giving this goose a gander.

++++ August

[[[walkure|Walküre]]] is a complicated piece. It is an anthology about soldiers and deals with trauma, the consequences of war, and war crimes. Overall a very solemn piece with excellent prose throughout.

++++ September

[[[SCP-7165]]] is a short, comedic article about the miserable love life of Dr. Elstrom, the ice queen of Site-43. It&#39;s even got VKTM thrown in for extra laughs! I will say, though, this is made all the funnier knowing the context of Dr. Elstrom&#39;s escapades which can be found [[[bitch-hub|here]]]. Either way, this is still a fun piece of literature.

++++ October

[[[wniosek-o-dotacje-na-wykorzystanie-paryskiej-architektury|GRANT REQUEST FOR THE UTILIZATION OF PARIS ARCHITECTURE TO PERFORM A MASS EXORCISM OF THE GHOSTS STILL LINGERING WITHIN THE CITY]]] takes an unbelievably fun premise and cranks it up to 11. Paris is the ghost capital of the world, and Prometheus Labs wants to turn the Eiffel Tower into a neutralizing agent against them. What?! It&#39;s like an early-1900&#39;s Ghostbusters. Very charming and amusing.

++++ November

[[[SCP-7812]]] is the epic conclusion to a years-long saga; The Hecatoncheires Cycle. It is interspersed with prose and feels like a well-earned finale. I would honestly recommend reading over the entire series, its excellent! Link [[[hecatoncheires-cycle-hub|here!]]]

++++ December

[[[critter-profile-francis|Critter Profile: Francis!]]] is a weird little article about an even weirder still little gremlin. He&#39;s a toon! A toon ghost! It&#39;s the perfect mixture of amusing and unsettling; something the author of the piece is very capable of pulling off.

And that&#39;s it! What do you think about the list? Do you have your own favorites of the year? Feel free to leave a comment in the discussion page of this edition of the Site News!

+ Writing Prompts
[[/div]]

Site News is bringing you monthly writing prompts! Every month there will be user-submitted prompts to help inspire new pieces. Participation in these prompts is completely optional, and any pages based on the prompts will be featured in the next issue of Site News! If you&#39;re interested in submitting a prompt for next Site News, send a wikidot PM to [[*user ParallelPotatoes]]. One prompt submission per person, and up to five prompts will be shown in each edition of Site News.

This month&#39;s writing prompts are below!

[[size x-large]]New Year&#39;s Resolution[[/size]] //Submitted by winkwonkboi//
Most people who write down goals they&#39;re going to achieve in the coming year never seem to finish them, and it&#39;s about time to break the cycle. Take an unfinished draft you haven&#39;t worked on for some time and finally complete it. No more slacking!

[[size x-large]]Ancient Greece[[/size]] //Submitted by Alzin Cdag//
Write an article (could be a SCP, tale or GoI format!) set in the ancient Greek myths, but with a Foundation twist! Circe is dado, the Administrator is Zeus, etc.

The following article was inspired by a prompt and written this month!

[[size x-large]][https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7239 Papal Bull(sh*t)][[/size]] //Written by Edmund Davids//
Inspired by &#34;An SCP Article With an Imprimatur&#34; from December 2023&#39;s prompts!

If you write an entry inspired by this or a previous month&#39;s prompts, feel free to send a wikidot PM to [[*user ParallelPotatoes]] to have it featured in the next Site News! There isn&#39;t a time limit on getting prompt submissions featured, so feel free to write for a previous month&#39;s prompts as well! [[footnote]]Please note than in the event of an official contest, contest entries that were inspired by a Site News prompt will be featured the month after the contest ends.[[/footnote]]
