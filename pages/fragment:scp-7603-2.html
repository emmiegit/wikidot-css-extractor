[[tab PART 1]]
I had been walking for about an hour now.

I realized far too late that I should have brought some money for a taxi or ferry, but it allowed me time to reflect. On one hand, I wondered if what I was doing was the correct course of action. Where was I going? What would I do when I got there? How would that solve anything? This was meaningless. All I had managed to do was walk a few kilometers through the orchid of suicidal souls.

On the other hand, thankfully no longer bleeding, I physically needed to get as far away as possible from the filth that was my Father.

Thankfully, no one was here to find me in the orchid, since it was dry season. There wasn&#39;t any point to anyone working now, since this was around the time the trees ruined their fruit by deliberately setting themselves on fire, which they do with great efficiency.

Emerging from the orchid, my instincts led me towards Downtown. It was essentially a series of commercial areas not too far from our estate, built next to the semi-defunct farm Father ran: Therion Produce. It used to be a standard farm that took advantage of the suicidal souls. Hourly wages, housing, and meager benefits. Except, Father discovered that it was cheaper to pay people per pound of usable apples they bring in, and hire them as independent contractors. All I know about the decision was that this made many people very upset, and Father said it funded my entire education.

A trip down the river would have made this journey last about three minutes. Even less time if I had learned how to teleport. But I //just had// to learn pyromancy and practice my proficiency with firearms instead.

I sighed. At least I got my cardio in today.

I did not have any plan. Nor did I have the money for a motel. The only thing I had was some worthless junk and a weapon of cosmic destruction strapped to my back, which stood as my only keepsake of Mother. Father was certain to come and find me, so I figured my best option was to head towards the homeless encampments along the river. He would not dream of setting foot there.

As I walked the streets, the looming shadows of the stone tower overpowered by the glow of their holographic signage, I noticed several groups of people gathering around one broadcasting the evening news. &#34;Therion Assassinates 3 Lords to Expand Portfolio,&#34; &#34;Lust, Greed, and Malediction Want Therion&#39;s Head,&#34; Nothing that I did not already know or deduce on my own, nor anything about my escape. Which could be good, as that means no one has discovered my disappearance.

What I cared more about was what people were saying. I found a nearby bench, and spotted a small group of other demons to listened in on. The demons looked like salarymen getting off of work; likely working for a company owned by my family.

&#34;Uggh, this is gonna be a civil war, isn&#39;t it? This is gonna be bad for business.&#34;

&#34;Yeah, but Therion secured those sins so we could be good economically, right?&#34;

&#34;Knowing Therion, he&#39;s gonna be making sure no one can get their hands on the rights to those sins. Even if it means not benefiting directly. He cares more about his legacy or some shit.&#34;

&#34;Yeah, or the number of people under him... Apparently the Red Dragon actually killed these guys. The guy has a kill list longer than the river itself.&#34;

&#34;Right? He&#39;s a monster. You think he&#39;s actually a demon? He doesn&#39;t even have a crown or halo, yet he&#39;s more powerful than most of the nobility.&#34;

&#34;I heard he&#39;s a fallen angel, he just LOOKS like a demon. Might be a seraphim.&#34;

&#34;Bullshit.&#34;

A seraphim? Are those not meant to be completely feral?

&#34;Those are basically //gods.// Nah, dude, he&#39;s just some kinda harpy. He&#39;s probably so powerful because he&#39;s one of Babalon&#39;s experiments.&#34;

&#34;A Babalon experiment? That&#39;s even dumber. No, you know what he is? He&#39;s Therion&#39;s illegitimate son.&#34;

&#34;What makes you think that?&#34;

&#34;Well, first, Therion fucks, let&#39;s get that out of the way. But the amount of soulstuff Therion&#39;d need to give the Red Dragon to reach that level of power? It&#39;s pretty fuckin heavy. He&#39;s probably given more soulstuff to him than his own **actual** son.&#34;

&#34;The Red Dragon&#39;s probably the reason **Therion** is so powerful. He&#39;s probably a bit paranoid of him, so Therion invested a lot of soulstuff towards himself instead of selling it.&#34;

&#34;Well, whatever the Red Dragon is, he&#39;s got the other merc&#39;s beat. He&#39;s the reason I haven&#39;t gotten into that shit on the side.&#34;

Hearing this, it made me realize that Father would likely send mercs to find me instead of finding me himself. Which meant, it was likely best for me to leave. I also realized that I actually knew very little about the Red Dragon. Father spoke very rarely of him, and Mother even less. I did not hear anything about him being an experiment of Mother&#39;s, so that was out as a probable origin. As for being my half-brother... perhaps? I would like to assume that I would know such a thing, but... it felt possible. As I walked off, I hoped that the fact I helped him would mean he might not go after me.

[[f&gt;image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7603/egg_prim.png style=&#34;width:616px;&#34;]]
I was tired. Emotionally and physically. I wanted to lay down and just... rest. What got my attention was a promotional display featuring my mother down the street. She and a few other A-listers were on several posters, wearing Mother&#39;s latest -likely last- product line, with several mannequins sporting her designer clothes.

I approached and... something possessed me. Figuratively, that is. I saw one outfit in particular and my reflection in the display window made it appear almost as if I was wearing it. I was still mad and grieving, but now I was questioning things about //myself//. A part of me wanted the dress. Perhaps behind the excuse of blending in better, but I knew it was not practical. Firstly, I would end up looking like Mother with Blood Rose //already// tied to my back, I would only //draw// attention. Secondly, I had no money. I could steal it, but I would rather not stir the hive.

Dejected, I tore myself away from the display and finally reached the camp. Inside was mostly rows and rows of shacks constructed from scavenged garbage stacked close together with nothing but layers of cheap plastic tarp over them to keep the elements out. I walked to a semi-crowded common area which was nothing more than a small square patch of dirt and people smoking or drinking on filthy mats. I found an unused one and sat down. I did not want to draw attention to myself, nor did I wish to bother anyone. I just needed to think about what to do next. Or at least, that is what I had planned to do.

The only thing that went through my mind was rage. Rage for Mother. Rage for everything Father has built for himself. And as I saw family after family try to make space in this room for themselves, I felt nothing but disgust on their behalf. When I was growing up, I was fed a line about helping the poor.

&#34;What if you got perfect marks in school, and we said &#39;Sorry Pluto, your classmate failed, so we have to allocate some of your points to them,&#39; and gave you a C?&#34; It was a point that seemed biased on its face. Father, my teachers, my schoolmates, even Mother attempted to appeal to me, banking on the gut reaction of wanting to protect my hard work. Maybe they would have a point if they built our society as a meritocracy, or if points on a test were a more finite and exchangeable resource.

Though, I did not question it at the time. It did not occur to me to question it. I realized that I was sheltered from the world, up until this point. When I saw this many people just trying to survive... There was no way that this many people simply stopped trying to improve their lives. Furthermore, the amount of effort it takes to do so in these conditions is... self evident, now that I saw it first-hand.

Listening to conversations of how a family is going to get out of their debt, how another family wondered how they would protect their children from being consumed by other demons... then I heard weeping just a few steps away. I sat up, and peered around the corner.

I saw a demon, bloody and crying as he was surrounded by the freshly butchered skulls of an adult and two kids. He reached into the body of a small boy, pulled out an unrecognizable, dripping hunk of gore, and brought it to his gnashing teeth. He opened his eye, and looked to me.

I left instantly. I knew that I was still at an advantage; I had an education, consumed far more souls, and as a result, would likely be in a vastly superior position no matter what I did. But nonetheless, I wanted to put this scene as far away from me as possible.

I admit, I was emotional. I started to envision my hands around the throat of my father, squeezing until his skull popped out of his head. I wanted him to pay. This amount of people in such grave situations could only be systemic. And yet, the silver spoon wasted in my mouth became yet another thing I held rage for.

I was only able to snap out of it when I looked up, and saw a large man wearing a stained and stitched-together suit of security armor. I could tell he was not an abomination, since I could see the scars across his face and his arms; all four of which could tear my head off.

One of his four hands clenched into a tight fist as I turned to face him. &#34;You Therion&#39;s boy, yeah?&#34;

&#34;Maybe,&#34; which was a more honest answer than a &#39;yes&#39; at this point. I looked closer at his suit. I could see the embroidered &#34;Therion Produce Security Officer&#34; on his armor, even if he tried to cross it out with paint.

&#34;Your dad&#39;s lookin for ya.&#34; Several more men surround me, guns drawn. &#34;Now, you&#39;re worth more unharmed, but money is money&#34;, he reached into a holster by his hip and drew out a worn revolver, &#34;You know... you look just like your dad.&#34;

I did not. But that did not stop him from acquainting my snout with the butt of his gun. I felt the full brunt of that swing, since I did not choose anyone to redirect any of that pain to. While that did knock me to the ground, I have taken worse. Ever since I could walk, Father had my limbs sawed off so I could grow them again. Pain Tolerance Training has taught me to block out the pain, and remind me who I was meant to serve.

It was a privilege of my education. I was fortunate for my family to have enough resources to support such training. Spending practically an entire soul a day to achieve this level of tolerance was not something even a mercenary could afford.

[[f&gt;image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7603/Red_Dragon.png style=&#34;width:616px;&#34;]] 
I crawled up and backed away, likely faster than they expected me to. Just as I had designated the one who swung at me, a shot rang out, followed by a loud, wet pop. I expected myself to be blown back from the blast. However, I was fine. Instead, the former security guard looked more like an exploded meat balloon. I felt flecks of blood splatter my face as his head hit the ground. Unless he was also an abomination, or had enough soulstuff reserved, I doubt he survived.

I know I saw people screaming, running away. My ears were still ringing, but I could make out the sounds of gunfire. Both from various assault rifles, and booming, focused shots of a Focalor .50-Griffin Anti-Material Rifle.

It was the Red Dragon.

From the demons exploding on contact, it was fair to say that he was using some form of explosive round. But the demons shot were exploding from //the inside.// I looked at the hem of my hoodie, and noticed holes being caustically burned into it from where flecks of blood landed.

After the mercenaries scattered, he landed. Half-faced towards me, half towards the direction the mercs ran off to. I paused to regain my composure. &#34;Did you not say that you depleted your ammunitions, earlier?&#34;

&#34;Not to you... But I did. //Most// of them. These are reserves.&#34; He looked off.

&#34;Well... Thank you for saving me.&#34;

&#34;Don&#39;t. Surrender your Mother&#39;s weapon, and come with me.&#34; He turned his full attention towards me, rifle in hand. &#34;I am to escort you back to your father. Comply and no harm will come to you.&#34;

&#34;You are still following his orders, I assume.&#34; I sighed.

&#34;Yes.&#34; He was cold.

&#34;I would sooner you kill me.&#34;

&#34;Not an option.&#34; The Red Dragon raised his gun. &#34;Orders are to bring you in alive. Failing that, your head, alive and un-butchered. I recommend coming willingly.”

For the first time, I stood firm on something. “I am sorry. That is not going to happen.”

There was a pause. I believe there was a brief realization that he did not want to follow through. However, his reluctance would not stop him. “... Fifteen seconds is all I can give you. Run.”

He spread his wings and took to the skies. And I started counting.

I took his advice and ran as fast as I could, trying not to let him catch a bead on me. 80 kilometers an hour, was not fast enough to outrun someone with his aim and flight speed. To account for this, I took as many turns down the streets as possible.

Looking over my shoulder for him would waste time. Running down a crowded, unprotected street, I could simply not afford to do so. So I went by the crowd&#39;s reaction. As they screamed, pointed up, and ran.

He had an Anti-Material Rifle, a weapon designed for use against military-grade materiel and high-density soul-material. Hiding behind a wall would likely do little in terms of protection, so I needed something else.

From how he stood out of designation range, it was likely that he knew of my ability. I needed to be unpredictable, break line of sight, and put distance between him and I. I sped down a few streets, only to double back halfway, and hopefully throw him off.

I believed I lost him, but I still needed to be anywhere but here. I took this as an opportunity to beeline straight for the orchids, since the leafage above would obfuscate me. And should he still be on me, I could take advantage of the Orchid and use the flames as cover. I sidestepped and was just about to make my way into the Orchids. I was going to make i

Time seemed to freeze. All the adrenaline in the world could not prevent the searing pain I felt when I my arm was hit. First, the bullet made contact, and then in rapid succession, I felt a pressure quickly build in my shoulder before the skin split, and burst into a loud, wet pop.

I looked, but I did not dare stop running. My arm was gone; a squirting stump having taken its place. While it was not the first time I had lost a limb, it was a pain that you never get used used to. The sleeve to my hoodie, which was now partially on fire, was blown off from the explosive round, and I could feel the acidic burns around the area, the flesh melting off my shoulder.

He must have been using a custom HEIAP round, as I do not remember hearing anything about this kind of ammunition before. I wanted to kneel down and stop the pain more than anything. I stifled a scream, and kept running. I did not have the luxury to stop. I needed to do something else, otherwise the next thing he would do is shoot my neck.

I needed cover.

I needed fire.

As I sprinted through the entrance of the orchard, I raised my only remaining hand, and released a bright flame onto the leaves above. I did not need to do much to spread the fire; their leaves and bark secrete a flammable oil, and the trees were eager to do it themselves. The Red Dragon could obviously shoot through the fire. But he knew blindly shooting into the flames would deplete his admittedly limited ammunition. We were at a temporary stalemate, but I was still down an arm. As soon as the leaves and bark were burnt up, I would be exposed.

Blood Rose was no help, since I could not effectively use it with just one arm. Which meant that I only had a dagger. Against a sniper.

I finally allowed myself to look up for him. As I had hoped, he could not see me through the flames, and was flying close in a bid to spot me. I had no idea what to do if he did spot me. If I ran, he would follow. If I threw my singular knife at him, I would be using my one chance in a move that would likely not even hurt him. Until I realized. The Red Dragon was close enough for me to redirect harm back to him. Stabbing myself would bypass his protections, but I needed to make it count. I needed to hurt him more than I was hurting myself.

Additionally, if he realized I was willing to self-harm, he would adapt his strategy around that.

I took a deep breath, and braced myself before I started. Stabbing myself in the back; right where his wings would be.

My vision blurred as I let the knife force its way through my flesh. I dry-heaved as I twisted the knife in deep, and caught the glimpse of his fall from the sky. I steadily approached, pulling the knife from my back. 

I wanted to scream from the burning pain. I wanted to run. But I could not afford to let him get another shot on me.
