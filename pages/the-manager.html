Good afternoon, Everett. May I call you Everett? Dr. Mann seems so impersonal. It&#39;s a fine summer day, isn&#39;t it? I&#39;d offer you a drink, but it seems you&#39;re the host today.

Don&#39;t be so shy. You want to know about the Factory, right? Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll tell you plenty. You can still torture me later, of course. I&#39;m afraid my screaming circuits are a little rusty, but I&#39;ll put in the effort. For you.

So what did you want to know? Perhaps the rundown on our upcoming products? There&#39;s a line of action figures coming up that I&#39;m particularly proud of. We&#39;ve got a new series of adult toys, and a couple others - don&#39;t want to give away too much, but let&#39;s just say there&#39;s nothing we can&#39;t make candy-coated.

Come now. Don&#39;t be so dramatic. We&#39;re hardly the worst problem you have - I wouldn&#39;t even call us a problem. We&#39;re just trying to keep you on your toes. At worst we&#39;re your court jesters, your Friday night entertainment. 

Tell me you didn&#39;t find the monkeys and the liquid rock charming. Or the God series. The anti-gravity device - how could that fail to tickle you? The contact lenses were practically benevolent - doesn&#39;t everyone at the Foundation want to see the world for how it really is? The silly putty - don&#39;t deny your researchers got some laughs out of that. I&#39;ve seen your testing logs, with those poor, hapless D-Classes. The pencil sharpeners, those really were a gift, considering the uses you&#39;ve put them to. ...Oh? You&#39;re one of the Foundation&#39;s most brilliant stars now, Everett. I&#39;ve heard stories... You can&#39;t tell me a few baby-faced schoolchildren still phase you.

Oh, of course that&#39;s what you meant. No, we haven&#39;t infiltrated your organization. Infiltration implies we&#39;re the enemy, that we actually need to //spy// on you. 

They work with you every day, why don&#39;t you ask them? How about Jack, eh? Certainly worked with more than his share of Factory items. And his lovely little necklace - I&#39;m sure you know the Foundation has since acquired a few more of those things. Even if there&#39;s... flaws... in the production line. Didn&#39;t you ever wonder... 

No, I see you&#39;re not ready to believe that one. That&#39;s alright. Loyalty is a virtue. It&#39;s true, you really have no reason to trust me.

Oh, is that what this is about? Someone told you a little story. Was it the one with the faeries? Dear me, I&#39;ve struck a nerve. I can see the seed of doubt was already there. Then perhaps you really don&#39;t want to hear that the best parts of that story are true. And the parts that aren&#39;t - well, don&#39;t worry, those only get better. You can&#39;t be told //too// much too fast. Don&#39;t want you to end up like poor Kondraki.

You look unimpressed. I&#39;m sorry, was that too dramatic? I try to save the drama for our products. But sometimes I just can&#39;t help myself. Look - you&#39;re important to us. Before you came along, where were we? Stuck mostly dealing in... oh no, wait, I&#39;m not supposed to tell you that, yet. For now, let&#39;s just say they were hard times. We want you around. You&#39;re not our first love, but you&#39;re the best.

We&#39;re not going to destroy the world, Everett. That isn&#39;t the point. We&#39;re just capitalists with a sense of humor. We want to add a little spice, a little flavor to the proceedings. 

We hold ourselves back, you see. We want to make sure you can handle us. For now.  Soon we won&#39;t need to keep the kid gloves on.

Of course that isn&#39;t a threat. We&#39;re the Factory. We produce, we don&#39;t posture. 

You&#39;re right. We&#39;ve got plans. Big ones, it&#39;s true. Tell you what - if you do a good job torturing me, I&#39;ll drop you a few spoilers. You&#39;ve got to go the extra mile, though. As I said, I&#39;ve heard stories about you, Everett. They say there are few limits to how far you&#39;ll go, when given the proper motivation. I&#39;ll be disappointed if you just waterboard me or chop off a few of my extra limbs. And be quick about it. I can&#39;t stay with you much longer.

Before you go, indulge me with one more question. About that story, Everett - the faerie story.  Did he tell you he thought - at first - that he had us tamed? That he did it all for the good of mankind?

Ah, I can see I&#39;m right. I //knew// he was still a sentimental man. It warms my entirely metaphorical heart.

The future is a brilliant place, Everett. You&#39;ll love it. We&#39;ll get there, together. I promise.
