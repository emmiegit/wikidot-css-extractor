It&#39;s been fifty years since the dictatorship, and they still feel heavy. Just a week ago they arrested those responsible for the cruel murder of Víctor Jara, an important populist singer-songwriter from the Allende era, whose hands and tongue were mutilated, who was forced to continue playing, to continue singing, and then was disfigured with a hail of bullets, bullets that kill freedom, the right to live in peace. And of those guilty, two fled, and one hanged himself in his cell. The president called the murderers cowards, and ignoring the obvious, how can we not simply resign ourselves to continuing walking, throwing the newspaper aside, using it to wrap fish, or putting it under the cat&#39;s litter box so that the piss doesn&#39;t pass through it? How can we not find irony in such injustice?

Where was this arrest thirty years ago, when democracy returned, and Alwyn boasted of its importance, while he spared the life of every butcher, every rapist? Where was justice twenty years ago, when Pinochet took his last breath, and so fear subsided and this supposed peace reigned again, and Bachelet promised better times, and the first female president stood tall, but did it arrive? Ten years later, Bachelet would be back, and people began revolts over the AFP -- pension systems established during the Pinochet era which never supported the people; thanks to economic inequality, no one can retire peacefully. And now, ten years after those ten years, here we are. Little has changed.

It&#39;s hard to explain how I feel about the dictatorship. It&#39;s frustrating, it&#39;s exhausting, it&#39;s business as usual. It is both a bleeding wound and a distant memory. Something invisible, but always is there, in everyone&#39;s mind, and the man walks and the woman goes on with her life, but every politician, every student, every teacher and activist thinks about it, that it is gone, but it is still there, sea foam that disappears the further one moves away from the beach, and the seagulls leave, they fly far, far away because there is no more food to eat and when will they return? Do they even want to return, or will they remain in distant lands, displaced by the hunter and the trapper? I don&#39;t blame them. Who would return to a land of volcanoes, of bombs whose ticking still echoes through the thin walls of this country we call home?

I wonder how people from outside see the situation in this hopelessly affected country. Will Ecuadorians know about the historical debt, about how teachers were robbed of their salaries, and forty years later there is still no justice? Does the Austrian know about the discotheque, the torture camp made exclusively for women, where they were raped day and night, the disco music and dirty rock-and-roll covering up the sobbing and gonorrhea? Does the American know about the meetings between Kissinger and Pinochet, holding a cocktail in hand while they watched the country burn—No, what country? The fucking world burned, and at the same time that the communist surrendered and was shot in Chile, fire and napalm consumed Vietnam, and Laos, and Cambodia was dyed red, and these bastards on the other side of the world were full of joy. Did you know this already, reader, or is this your first time? I don&#39;t blame you or judge you if that&#39;s the case. There is a first time for everything.

The dictatorship is a complicated topic to analyze. Now that fifty years have passed, the military is not in the streets, and people are not shot by them, and there is no longer a dictator but rather general votes, but the old deputy still thinks that people did not bleed to death back then, and the president is confronted by the disappeared, and money is lost. And while the deputy commander of the police is outed as a torturer and it&#39;s discovered that he has stolen billions since &#39;78, and has so many houses and so many cars, and founded a private university, and has shares in a national airline. Thus it is investigated and it is discovered that the nephew of a celebrity helped steal the money, and lists and notes are discovered, comments from people who always knew, but were afraid to speak, or who always knew, and were passed a bill or two and they forgot to tell the prosecution. Thus the threads become unraveled into a ball and one realizes that the dictatorship is still alive, still breathing, and perhaps it is in a coma, and its brain is dead, and there is nothing left for it but to die, but it lives, it lives, and it is felt in the flesh of all Chileans, whether they are in Chile or not.

What remains in the future, then, for me – for the average Chilean, for the foreigner who wants justice for the world, for you reader? I do not know, that&#39;s the truth; I have never been an optimist, and I think that justice is still several decades away, if ever. The only thing I know is that the dictatorship will never die, and it will remain as a stain in the history of the nation, a strange blur that will stay there forever, a scaffolding over our home that will never be removed, because the military convinced us that bastions of the country are not so good, and now the foundations have rotted from the inside, and we really do not know how to remove the scaffolding, and we patch without removing the rotten wood, and we end up choosing to ignore that they are there, sinning with our indifference.

Even so, I know that we still fight against abuse, whether the battle is lost or not, and even though the vile live and die free, eventually the rotten wood will collapse completely, and maybe the home will collapse, or maybe not, but we will be free — and if it collapses, we will have to rebuild together, and maybe this time we will do the job well, and we will not give up on repairing what is broken, waiting for a next government to know what to do with the ruin and debris. I know this will happen, although I don&#39;t know when, or how we&#39;ll be then. What I know is that I will be there to help. Will I be the only one, or will you be there as well?

I woke up early in the morning and saw a headline on the news. “Víctor Jara: Military personnel sentenced for kidnapping and murder of Chilean singer-songwriter.”

The news made me happy, but it was not the happiness of someone who receives a gift, or that of someone who hugs a loved one. It was the happiness that is born like water from a stone, the strange seed that takes root in the barren pain of poorly healed wounds. Víctor Jara, that man of peace who was unjustly immolated on the altar of the new order that took over his country – his entire continent – ​​the order that boasted of being progress and only gave us terror embodied in thousands of tortured, disappeared and murdered. Víctor Jara, that musician whose melodies I have never heard, whose voice is unknown to me and at the same time is so intimate, because it was the voice of an entire generation that was lost in a sea of ​​blood. Víctor Jara, the poet whose hands were broken so that he could not play the guitar and whose tongue was cut out so that he could no longer sing, who was shot sixteen times but even then did not lose his voice or his soul – because he was already immortal.

Twenty-five years in prison have been handed to each of his murderers, to each of the soldiers who saw in his words a threat, in his breath a whirlwind capable of bringing down the mountain of violence and repression that they built. With their bullets they sought to silence him, they sought to reduce him to bloody and nameless flesh, but they only managed to turn him into more than a man.

At dawn I will learn that one of those criminals, the one whose weapon had the caliber with which the fatal wounds were inflicted on Jara&#39;s body, has committed suicide so as not to spend the rest of his life in prison. //Coward//, I think instantly, because those who were beasts in life are in death nothing but pathetic shadows, unworthy of receiving compassion or pity. I eat breakfast with bitterness, because the end of a monster is not a reason for celebration -- true punishment is and will always be knowing that they are hated, condemned to live with themselves between four walls of mute and unforgiving concrete while they become less than ghosts for the world outside.

Chile is a large scar on the face of Latin America, perhaps the largest wound left behind by military dictatorships, regimes sustained by hatred and terror, born of ambition and greed. Because it is not only the military who gave breath to the monster turned State; our northern neighbor is equally guilty, yet still claims to be a champion of democracy and freedom: Latin America would not be the same without the United States, and neither would our dead.

The other 9/11, they call us while they mourn the collapse of two towers – a collapse that was born from their own sins in the Middle East. The //other// 9/11, because we are the //others//, those who do not exist in the collective ignorance of the gringos, of those who with their greens financed genocides in Guatemala and Indonesia, who trained us to torture each other, who taught us to [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venda_Sexy | rape men and women with dogs and rats]]], who showed us that the only good communist is a dead one. September 11, 1973, an infamous date, baptized in blood and anointed in fire, forgotten in the country of the stars and stripes – but eternally engraved in the souls of all of us below.

Why am I, a Mexican, so outraged by Chile? Why do I sometimes feel like I bleed with them, like the pain is shared? Why do I mourn for something that happened fifty years ago? Why do I feel anger grow like a fire in my veins when someone dares to defend Pinochet and his henchmen?

I once wrote that Latin American identity is nothing but a pile of fragments crudely glued together, disjointed and amorphous. Our constants are language and struggle, the eternal fight against ourselves and against those who invade us. And yet we don&#39;t agree on anything: we are a bunch of brothers and sisters full of resentments, incapable of asking for forgiveness for our self-inflicted agony, of healing and forming a common front.

But perhaps that is why the fury rises from my heart to make me stand up, to make me raise my voice and demand justice for people who have been dead or missing for half a century, for those who are still alive and remember with pain the atrocities of the regime. That is why I listen to the words of my teacher, Dr. Ugo Pipitone, who witnessed firsthand the fall of democracy and the rise of the usurpers, who with his heavy accent of an immigrant reborn in the Mexican embrace exclaims “Never again!”, and I say to myself, //This is the fight that we all must stand for, the fight for a memory that never gives in to forgiveness or forgetness.//

That is why I write now, even if it is from anonymity, and perhaps that makes my words a little more valuable: I could be anyone, any person who, from their own trench, stands and shouts so that no one ever forgets. I am not a poet, I am not the voice of anyone but myself, but this is what I choose to do, what I choose to say, what I choose to turn into living text so that whoever reads it knows what happened, what should be allowed to happen again.

Never again Chile.

Never again Latin America.

Never again.

* ##006600|What is the most painful thing about remembering the coup?##

##cc0000|The footprints that are still alive. As you saw with Vitoco[[footnote]] Víctor Jara [[/footnote]] and his murderers, the dictatorship is not completely dead. There is still injustice in the streets, they still owe money to the professor and answers to the widow, because during the dictatorship they simply decided to change the constitution and let the people pay the bill; many of them have died in the fifty years that this wound has been bleeding, and after eight governments – from the left, from the right, from the center – somehow they see the pain of the people and let it pass. The most painful thing about remembering the coup is that you don&#39;t need to look back to the past to see the pain and helplessness on the faces of the people.##

* ##cc0000|What is your perspective, as an outsider, on the dictatorship and the injustice that continued during and after this?##

##006600|I wish there was consensus. There are those of us who know what happened and understand that it is unforgivable, that there is no way to clean up the blood and pain in the name of &#34;the greater good.&#34; We are aware that it could have been any of us, that it could have been any person we love who was disappeared. But there are also the apologists, those who make pain a &#34;just&#34; cause because according to them it saved Chile and the rest of Latin America from becoming Cuba. That&#39;s why they celebrate instead of lamenting, that&#39;s why they give praise instead of condemnation.##

* ##006600|How does knowing your country&#39;s past affect you personally?##

##cc0000|It&#39;s complicated. My family was greatly affected by the past; My grandfather&#39;s businesses were positively affected, because people with money always supported the regime, and I never lacked anything while growing up, but at the same time many of my uncles live all over the world today, having fled for years. They have good lives: As far as I know, none of them died of hunger, or suffered like those who stayed, and sometimes I visit them and I come to think that they left with the idea of ​​having better lives, and not because they were persecuted out of the country.##

##cc0000|But then I think about my uncle Heráclito, and how they tortured him, and I get a lump in my throat, because thanks to the dictatorship my family had a good life, and thanks to the dictatorship my family had an awful life. The past is a terrible thing, because one sees the connections – how every piece fits perfectly – but when the painting is formed the piece is lost, everything is mixed and suddenly your grandfather and your uncle disappear, and only the fact remains. And despite not having lived this past, it is felt in one&#39;s veins, in the looks people give you, in the history classes that skip the dictatorship, in the book that leans a bit too muchto the left -- or to the right -- and bits of history are lost. It affects me a very much to know about my country&#39;s past, and it also affects me to know that I am not the only one who is affected.##

* ##cc0000|How do the Americas look from your perspective, especially with respect to interventionism during the Cold War?##

##006600|Mexico suffered the unique case of becoming Judas for both its own people and for the rest of Latin America. Historically, the gringos have invaded and violated us as much as the rest of continent: we lost half of our territory, and those of us who migrate to what was once ours are called rapists and murderers despite the fact that those who invented ways to torture and kill men, women and children were Kissinger and his CIA henchmen. Where others were given coups, we were into an abused dog, a hound that barks and bites migrants coming from Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Venezuela and Guatemala. We are fragmented because we continue to be complicit in the violence of the United States.##

* ##006600|How do you react when you see someone defending the dictatorship?##

##cc0000|I must admit that nowadays I don&#39;t have much left but resignation. Had you asked me ten years ago – perhaps more – and I would have answered you with anger, with a feeling of wanting to fight everyone, for my country, for the students and teachers, for all those who have been mistreated by the shadow left behind by all this shit, for countries both near and far, for minorities whose languages ​​and culture I do not understand, for lives that I will never know but for whom I feel empathy anyway. Today, I feel battered and bruised. I understand the simile of the abused dog: a people that eats away at itself, and it is difficult for me to continue shouting at the wind. People see the dictatorship and think that nothing bad happened because it didn&#39;t affect them, and if something doesn&#39;t affect someone, does it even exist? And so, people defend the dictatorship, and continue profiting from ignorance, and I don&#39;t have the energy left to say otherwise.##

* ##cc0000|I&#39;m tired. I&#39;ve studied the dictatorship and realized that things don&#39;t change, and what little does change, changes slowly and inefficiently. How do we move forward?##

##006600|We keep moving forward by creating community. We must not forget that we are Latin America, and that we may not have much in common outside of language and the traumatic experience of being the playground of empires, but we are brothers and sisters. We need to understand the pain of others, be it our countryman or our neighbor with whom we share a border, and even the pain of someone who is a continent away. We need to think &#34;that could have been me in the black bag, in the trunk of the car leading to the torture center, facing the firing squad or lying in the mass grave.&#34; If we do not understand that those bodies, those names, had families, had dreams, loves, hopes, lives -- if we do not see them as humans, like us -- we allow the evil that gave birth to the dictatorship to take shape. &#34;Never again&#34; depends on us not tolerating hate, no matter where it comes from or against whom it&#39;s directed.##
