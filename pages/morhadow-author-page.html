Hello guys!! I guess that you want to see my works. There we go

[[[SCP-4620]]] - Bread for Today, Wage for Never

&gt; This is my first skip //**here**//. I planned to write this for ClicheCon as an object that does a thing extremely well but I was busy[[footnote]] For busy, I meant lazy. [[/footnote]]. So I left the idea in the dust until jamcon 2019 and trying how fast could I write. I&#39;m not satisfied much with this, but due to the theme I can&#39;t do much.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks [[*user Detective marw]]. Good kitten!
&gt; 
&gt; Surprisingly, it has a Japanese translation...

[[[SCP-4791]]] - The Lady&#39;s Matchmaker

&gt; My favourite skip written //**here**//. I love the End of Death canon, one of the best in the wiki. But there are aspects still unexplored[[footnote]] Not anyone fault. Just that EoD encompass a lot.[[/footnote]] like fiction made in the period. And the theme was pulp fiction. And this is how this abstract piece was born. I&#39;m fine with this and how did it make and bla bla.
&gt; 
&gt;  Thanks for [[*user Jakuwoski]] for translating. You are the best!

[[[SCP-4927]]] - Have a Nice Flight
&gt; --Last skip //**here**// at the moment!-- I was inspired. I wanted to write it. I changed my idea halfway thanks to an interpretation of a [[[http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dc-yerko|good planet]]]. I searched feedback. I published it. It will do good.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for [[*user Alkenoc]] for translating it fast! Spanish Branch, best Branch!!

[[[SCP-5526]]] - Solar Conversion
&gt; Let&#39;s just say that writing in a very tight time limit isn&#39;t my jam, more so in another language. A victim of badly-used negative space.
&gt; 
&gt; For some reason is in Chinese.
