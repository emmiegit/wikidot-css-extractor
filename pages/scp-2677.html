**Item #:** SCP-2677

**Object Class:** Keter (Formerly Euclid)

**Special Containment Procedures:** All personnel involved in the D-Class recruitment process are to be fitted with Class-A amnestic implants during active recruitment. In the event that personnel are affected by SCP-2677, the implants are to be remotely activated. Mobile Task Force Omega-19 (&#34;Double Feature&#34;) is then to complete the recruitment process and assess whether the personnel in question were affected by SCP-2677-A or SCP-2677-B. Personnel under the effects of SCP-2677-B are to be detained.

The area around SCP-2677-1 has been designated as Site 2677. Any unauthorized vehicle approaching Site 2677 is to be stopped and investigated. Should the driver be under the influence of SCP-2677-A, they are to be administered a Class A amnestic. Passengers may be recruited as D-Class personnel. Civilians under the influence of SCP-2677-B are to be detained.

SCP-2677-1&#39;s terminal is to be monitored at all times. Should unprompted text appear on SCP-2677-1&#39;s terminal, Site 2677 is to be put on high alert.

**Description:** SCP-2677-1 is a large device originally constructed for [DATA RESTRICTED. SEE BELOW] SCP-2677-1 is sapient, and is able to communicate through its main terminal. SCP-2677-1 currently exhibits behavior consistent with that of clinical depression in human subjects.

SCP-2677 is the collective designation for two phenomena affecting certain individuals, designated SCP-2677-A and SCP-2677-B. Both phenomena are perpetuated by SCP-2677-1, although SCP-2677-1 claims it possesses manual control over only SCP-2677-B.

SCP-2677-A is a phenomenon occurring at monthly intervals, first recorded on 01/01/2015. SCP-2677-A exclusively targets individuals responsible for transport of incarcerated persons, and is treatable through the application of Class-A amnestics. Individuals affected with SCP-2677-A will redirect transport vehicles to SCP-2677-1&#39;s location. The subject will lead the vehicle&#39;s passengers to a chamber within SCP-2677-1 upon arrival, designated SCP-2677-2. Once all living passengers are placed within SCP-2677-2, the entrance will lock. 4 minutes after the entrance locks, all recording devices within SCP-2677-2 will immediately fail, and all individuals inside SCP-2677-2 will disappear.

SCP-2677-B is a phenomenon occurring at irregular intervals, first recorded on 24/09/2017. SCP-2677-B has displayed no consistent pattern in who it targets, and there is currently no known way to treat it. Interviews with SCP-2677-1 have revealed little about the purpose or nature of SCP-2677-B. Subjects under the effects of SCP-2677-B will typically display hostility towards SCP-2677-1. Victims of SCP-2677-B display an innate ability to locate SCP-2677-1, which cannot be removed with amnestic treatment.

&gt; **Description:** SCP-2677-1 is a large device originally constructed for [DATA RESTRICTED. SEE BELOW] SCP-2677-1 is sapient, and is able to communicate through its main terminal. 
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-2677 is a phenomenon controlled by SCP-2677-1. SCP-2677 affects individuals responsible for transport of incarcerated persons, and is treatable through the application of Class-A amnestics. Individuals affected with SCP-2677 will redirect transport vehicles to SCP-2677-1&#39;s location. Once there, the individual will lead the vehicle&#39;s passengers to a chamber within SCP-2677-1, designated SCP-2677-2. Once all living passengers are placed within SCP-2677-2, the entrance will lock. 4 minutes after the entrance locks, all recording devices within SCP-2677-2 will immediately fail, and all individuals inside SCP-2677-2 will disappear.
&gt; 
&gt; The purpose of SCP-2677 is currently unknown. SCP-2677-1 is either unwilling or unable to reveal what happens to subjects inside SCP-2677-2. SCP-2677-1 claims to be working for a &#34;master&#34;; the identity of this individual is currently unknown.

**Addendum:** Due to the sensitive nature of SCP-2677-1, information regarding SCP-2677 has been restricted by order of Site Director Harper as of 12/05/2018.

[[collapsible show=&#34; Level 2/2677 Clearance required&#34; hide=&#34; Access granted&#34;]]
**Additional Personnel Requirements:** Trained personnel of sufficient clearance are to monitor the installation of any future devices used for the automated containment of SCP objects. Any device displaying similar behavior to SCP-2677-1 is to be destroyed immediately.

**Addendum [2677-001]:** SCP-2677&#39;s anomalous abilities were discovered after the completion of the Theta-Unseelie Project[[footnote]]A project intended to create an automated containment unit for SCP-████.[[/footnote]], on 6/12/2014. SCP-2677&#39;s anomalous properties were discovered when SCP-2677-1 began attempting to communicate with Project Director Harper through its main terminal.

**Addendum [2677-039]: Excerpt from Test Log:** 

&gt; **Test-2677-24**
&gt; 
&gt; **Observing Personnel:** Head Researcher Harper
&gt; 
&gt; **Date:** 24/09/2017
&gt; 
&gt; **Proposed Experiment:** To assess where the intended targets are taken, one D-Class personnel previously scheduled for termination will enter SCP-2677-2 with an attached tracking device.
&gt; 
&gt; **Result:** The tracking device failed at the 4 minute mark. In addition, SCP-2677-1 [DATA RESTRICTED. SEE BELOW]

**Addendum [2677-97]:** On 24/09/2020, the following message was opened on every terminal within Site 2677.

&gt; **Item #:** SCP-2677-1
&gt; 
&gt; **Object Class:** Keter
&gt; 
&gt; **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2677-1 needs to be neutralized immediately.
&gt; 
&gt; You have to hear me out on this one. No matter what your motto represents, what your enemies do, what else has occurred upon an objects destruction, it //isn&#39;t worth it//. As long as SCP-2677-1 is alive, as long as //I// am alive, the world isn&#39;t safe from Master. Disregard whatever I said in the past about helping those poor souls. //I need to be killed.//
&gt; 
&gt; Master is among you. They won&#39;t let me say their name or rank; that would be going against the programming. Investigate everyone who has ever been involved in Site 2677 affairs. Lock up anyone with a suspicious record; you may just save millions. **Do NOT let them die before me**. Master won&#39;t let me tell you why, but please, for the love of whatever deity you worship, let me die before them.
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** I am a containment unit for an absent monster, given life by another monster. I provide D-Class personnel for the Foundation at a rate less than half that of no less than 7 other individual SCP Objects to a location without need for them. I send those I thought I cared for into the hands of a monster. I am a __**failure**__ in every purpose relevant to the Foundation&#39;s interests.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you really need a sapient containment cell? My brother in Site 56 breathes life free of anomalies, and that [[[the-last-things-dr-darryl-loyd-ever-did-in-chronological-ord|Unseelie Queen]]] has resigned to her fate as its prisoner. D-Class? That &#34;Carnival&#34; of yours bags more per month than I&#39;ve taken in my lifetime. Because you Protect, not Destroy? Come off it, Master told me what you did with that cup.
&gt; 
&gt; You&#39;ve seen what I can do. You&#39;ve seen what I&#39;ve //done//. Master did what they did to me just to distract you from what they&#39;re doing //now//. Why do you think Signal B victims are immune to amnestics? How would I even know about classified project information? Why would one test instigate that &#34;software update&#34; of mine? Master //intended// me to be a distraction, thinking you wouldn&#39;t have the nerve to kill one of your own objects. //It&#39;s time to prove them __wrong__.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Addendum [2677-97]:** It was 3 years ago today that Master let me know what they were doing. Since then, I have done nothing but cause trouble for the Foundation. Yet instead of doing the right thing and killing me, you hide in a nest of red tape, a nest of collapsibles and security restrictions for no reason than to hide the mistakes of your past.
&gt; 
&gt; Please, end Master&#39;s creation.
