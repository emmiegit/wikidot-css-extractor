[[div class=&#34;test&#34;]]
**Instance Number:** SCP-5846-2-16
**Name on SCP-5846-1:** Banana Bonanza
**Notable Anomalous Properties:** Instance’s interior was decorated to resemble a tropical rainforest, containing numerous barriers scattered throughout that were native to the area SCP-5846-2-16 was imitating. Individuals entering the store were given bananas by employees dressed in gorilla costumes. These bananas were able to anomalously shoot bullets, with those hit by them erupting into various fruits. A sign reading &#34;Laser tag has never been more bananas than this!&#34; could be seen at the store’s entrance.

[[div class=&#34;test&#34;]]
**Instance Number:** SCP-5846-2-18
**Name on SCP-5846-1:** The Omniscient Library
**Notable Anomalous Properties:** Instance was a library containing hardcover books bearing only a title on the front. These books presented the reader with various information regarding topics portrayed from the perspective of the reader. Such works included:

**&#34;Food for Thought&#34;:** Book contained descriptions as well as notable dishes of numerous eating establishments, with the reader’s opinion on them attached as reviews.
**&#34;Back to School&#34;:** Book contained the reader’s thoughts on schools they had attended, detailing several events, students, staff, etc. After finishing the publication, the reader would be compelled to revisit the areas mentioned.
**&#34;Onstage Clown&#34;:** Book contained moments during the reader’s life they would consider &#34;embarrassing.&#34; As the subject reads the publication, they were able to hear distant laughing, intensifying as they continued. These sounds ceased when closing the book.
**&#34;What Lies Ahead&#34;:** The book was empty. Opening it resulted in the reader losing their sense of sight and hearing until closing it again.

**Notes:** Test was conducted to observe whether SCP-5846 could replicate the Wanderer’s Library.

**Name:** Dr. Folmar
**Date:** 30/8/21
[[div class=&#34;test&#34;]]
**Instance Number:** SCP-5846-2-17
**Name on SCP-5846-1:** World of Laser Tag
**Notable Anomalous Properties:** Instance starts out as a lobby for laser tag games, operating similarly to that of other laser tag businesses up until a game is about to start. As the game starts, subjects who have signed up and were equipped for the game are instantaneously teleported to a battlefield of unknown size. Each team is composed of two field armies, both with similar equipment [[footnote]]Including, but not limited to: grenades, pistols, sniper rifles, and tanks. All aforementioned equipment that would otherwise be lethal instead shoots lasers similar to that of regular laser tag guns, and are therefore completely harmless.[[/footnote]] and structure to that of the United States Armed Forces. Subjects are to follow the orders of their superiors and fire at the opposing team with their equipment. If a subject is hit by any lasers, they are instantaneously teleported back to the lobby. The goal is to fight until either team is completely eliminated or surrenders, in which case the remaining team wins and the remaining individuals are teleported back to the lobby[[footnote]]Only subjects that entered SCP-5846-2-17 are teleported back to the lobby after elimination or the end of a round, suggesting that other entities are either destroyed or teleported to an alternative location[[/footnote]]. Depending on how well an individual follows orders and performs in a match, they are awarded with tokens upon their teleportation to the lobby. Later testing has revealed that the amount of tokens correlates to the rank and equipment an individual gets upon joining any future games.
