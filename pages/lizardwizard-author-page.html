Hi, I&#39;m LizardWizard. I wanted to have an author page but I didn&#39;t actually want to put any effort into it. This is already a year late. I wrote this in a fairly depressive state, and really don&#39;t want to have to put more thought in it than I had to. I&#39;ll probably update it one day to be more... good.

I don&#39;t know how to do listpages, sorry. Anyways, here&#39;s my stuff:


SCPs:

[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6446 SCP-6446: Into the Looking Glass]
My first page on the wiki. I was proud of this at the time, and still am to an extent.

[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6902 SCP-6902: Lost Luggage]
My highest rated solo article. It is also my shortest, and the one I spent by far the least time on. 

[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-900 SCP-900: City of the Sun]
I got to rewrite a series 1 SCP, alongside the wonderful [[*user DrGooday]]! That was neat, and good fun. 

[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7006 SCP-7006: Initiative]
My most successful project, and also the one that burnt me out on the wiki for months. This was an absolute nightmare to create. Many thanks to my team [[*user Liryn]], [[*user Darkstuff]], [[*user Ihp]], [[*user Djoric]], as well as the [https://instagram.com/graceunderpressure fantastic] [https://twitter.com/just_randie team] [https://instagram.com/wafflehousefan53 of] [https://twitter.com/fisheverlasting artists] that provided an invaluable visual component to the work. I never want to do something like this again.

[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1984-j SCP-1984-J: Literally 1984]
My first (and likely only) J. Made only because I realized the number was open.

Tales:

[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-trip-down-memory-lane A Trip Down Memory Lane]
This was a fun one. Based on a conversation [[*user HarryBlank]] and I had in discord, discussing how absurd an offhand remark in [[[SCP-6500]]] is.

[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/with-many-choices With Many Choices]
Probably my favorite thing I&#39;ve written so far. Written over the course of five months. I got stuck at one point, but [[*user Grigori Karpin]] swooped in at the end and saved it.

[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/crash-and-burn Crash and Burn]
A tale I wrote for Deptcon. I was fairly proud of it, but looking back I really need to work on my dialogue.

Other:

[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lizardwizard-author-page My Author Page]
This is an embarrassment and I just want to be done.
