**Item #:** SCP-2593

**Object Class:** --Safe-- Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** 

[[collapsible show=&#34;Original Containment Procedures&#34; hide=&#34;Close Original Document&#34;]]
SCP-2593 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, furnished to comfort levels for a non-dangerous humanoid entity.  It is to be observed remotely for anomalous behavior.

SCP-2593 is not to be allowed to leave the site after delivering its baked goods.

Deliveries made by SCP-2593 are to be scanned for anomalous composition, once weekly.  All baked goods are to be disposed of.
[[/collapsible]]

------

[[collapsible show=&#34;Revised Containment procedures&#34; hide=&#34;Close Revision&#34;]] 
Due to the nature of SCP-2593, containment shall consist of accepting SCP-2593&#39;s daily delivery at 0700 hours each morning, followed by  psychological counselling at Administrative Site-217.  Staff are encouraged to interact with SCP-2593, and are to report any unusual activity involving SCP-2593 immediately.

SCP-2593 is not to be allowed to leave the site after delivering its baked goods.

Deliveries made by SCP-2593 are to be scanned for anomalous composition, once weekly. All baked goods are to be disposed of.
[[/collapsible]]

------

**Containment Procedures Rev. 3**
As SCP-2593 has become hostile to the Foundation, and Foundation personnel, SCP-2593 is to be terminated on sight by security staff.  Failure to do so before SCP-2593 will result in SCP-2593 remaining uncontained until the next manifestation event, as SCP-2593 has, invariably since the time of revision, attempted to flee Foundation custody.  

In 87% of all successful terminations, SCP-2593 has rematerialized adjacent to Site-217&#39;s security perimeter.  All other foundation sites are to be placed on high alert.

All delivered baked goods are to be incinerated at first opportunity.  At no time are SCP-2593&#39;s baked goods to be ingested.

**Description:** SCP-2593 is an anomalous humanoid entity which appears at a fixed location and time each day, making a delivery of donuts and bagels to Administrative Site-217. SCP-2593 disappears at a fixed point in time later the same day. 

SCP-2593 is an anomalous manifestation of James ██████, former owner of a local bakery, Donut Jimmy&#39;s Bakery.  Donut Jimmy&#39;s Bakery was contracted to deliver baked goods daily, for distribution to break rooms throughout the Site.

Foundation records indicate that James ██████ attended the California Institute of Technology and received a PhD in chemistry in ████. 

James ██████ was considered for approach by the Foundation for employment, before being screened out due to lack of aptitude in his field.  Further records show that multiple applications to various employers were denied due to lack of applicability of his research work, and a general lack of aptitude. 

James ██████ opened Donut Jimmy&#39;s Bakery with a classmate from his secondary school (George Callaghan) in ████, four years after obtaining his PhD.

SCP-2593 was determined to be anomalous on September 1, ████, when Administrative Site-217 accounts payable found a discrepancy in the food budgets for refreshments, leading to an investigation by Agents Donnelly and McGill.  Donut Jimmy&#39;s Bakery was observed to have been closed for several days.  Local business owners claimed that the bakery had not opened since September 1, ████.  

Remote observation of SCP-2593 after it made its daily delivery to Administrative Site-217 showed that SCP-2593 will disappear from view at a distance of .72 KM from the entrance to Administrative Site-217 and will reappear at precisely 0700 hours each day.  

Analysis of SCP-2593&#39;s delivery confirmed that all food was non-anomalous.  Chemical Analysis confirmed them safe for human consumption, however, as they&#39;re produced through anomalous means, they are to be disposed of.

SCP-2593 was contained on September 3, followed by an interview about its deliveries. SCP-2593 claimed to have no knowledge of any of the events or effects surrounding SCP-2593 and was placed in a standard humanoid containment chamber.  SCP-2593 was extremely distressed and agitated, when informed of the anomalous context surrounding it.

On September 4, ████, SCP-2593 disappeared from its containment cell, and appeared .72 km outside of Administrative Site-217, with the usual quantity of food for delivery each morning.  Containment procedures were amended to include an expansion of Site-217&#39;s perimeter.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Expansion of Administrative Site-217&#39;s perimeter&#34; hide=&#34;Close Addendum&#34;]]
In light of SCP-2593&#39;s manifestation each morning outside of the facility, Administrative Site-217&#39;s perimeter was expanded to include the area of manifestation.  Thus far, SCP-2593 has not changed its manifestation site, and continues to make daily deliveries.  

Ongoing interviews with SCP-2593 have led to increased agitation, and distress, as each time SCP-2593 is informed of its nature, SCP-2593 claims to remember each other encounter with Foundation staff since containment.  

As such, at this time, it is recommended that SCP-2593 is not informed of its nature, and remote observation continue, barring any further incident.

[[collapsible show=&#34;First incidence of non-expected baked goods&#34; hide=&#34;Close Addendum&#34;]]
On March 1, ████, SCP-2593&#39;s delivery occurred at the expected time, however, the contents of the delivery contained irregularities.

All donuts commonly referred to as &#34;jelly filled&#34; were instead filled with peanut butter, consistent with Donut Jimmy&#39;s Bakery peanut butter used in other baked goods.  All donuts commonly referred to as &#34;Boston Creme&#34; were filled instead with mayonnaise, again consistent with other Donut Jimmy&#39;s Bakery baked goods.

SCP-2593 was asked about these discrepancies, and was reluctant to answer, asking if the Foundation was requesting a termination of the contract with Donut Jimmy&#39;s Bakery.  Foundation agents denied this was the case, and SCP-2593 grew more agitated.  SCP-2593 disappeared from view in containment at 0700 hours, as per usual.

[[tab Psychological evaluation of SCP-2593]]
On June 1, ████, SCP-2593 was confronted, and asked about the products it was bringing to Administrative Site-217.  SCP-2593 began to cry uncontrollably, and psychological staff were called in.  Interview with SCP-2593 is below with Dr. Jamesson.

&gt; **Dr Jamesson:** SCP-2593, my name is Dr. Jamesson.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2593:** My name is █████ ██████.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Jamesson:** Apologies,  Jimmy, may I call you, Jimmy?
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-2593 calms down significantly at the use of the given name//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2593:** Sure...I&#39;d prefer it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Jamesson:** Jimmy, why are your donuts and bagels wrong lately?  I&#39;ve never heard of you bringing the wrong food before.  
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2593:** I just want this to stop...whatever it is, I just...it never ends.  
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Jamesson:** You&#39;re saying you remember all of it?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2593:** Of course I remember all of it.  I thought I was going crazy.  I would bring the food, then sometimes people would lock me in a room, and interrogate me...I had no idea what was going on.  All I could do is make the donuts wrong.  I don&#39;t even remember baking them, but I thought about what would happen if the jelly filled had peanut butter, and the Boston Cremes had mayo in them and...
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Jamesson:** We had no idea, James.  
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2593:**   Why is this even happening to me?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Jamesson:** One second.
&gt; 
&gt; //Dr Jamesson radios to request permission to explain the situation to SCP-2593.  An affirmative response is returned.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Jamesson:** Jimmy, how much do you know about this facility?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2593:** It&#39;s just an office.  You guys get a bunch of food, and you&#39;re my first delivery of the day usually.  
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Jamesson:** I see.  Jimmy, that&#39;s not really what happens here.  I&#39;m not authorized to tell you much, but we&#39;re an organization that&#39;s...well, we protect people.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2593:** Oh come on, I&#39;ve been delivering to you guys for six years, and you&#39;re telling me this is some kind of-- Oh God, is this some kind of government black site?  Am I gonna go to a prison somewhere?  Are you gonna lock me up again?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Jamesson:** No.  We&#39;re not with the government.  We&#39;re...well, I can&#39;t really tell you everything, but we protect people.  From things like what happened to you.  
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2593:** So why the hell didn&#39;t you stop whatever happened to make me this way?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Jamesson:** You&#39;re the first person this has happened to.  We&#39;d like to try and figure out what happened, though.  And make sure the effect doesn&#39;t spread.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2593:** I just want to go home, doc...
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Jamesson:** We&#39;ll do what we can, Jimmy.  We&#39;d like to help you though.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2593:** How? What are you gonna do?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Jamesson:** Tomorrow, when you make your delivery, I&#39;d like to talk to you again.  If you&#39;re willing. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2593:** I...I think I&#39;d like that.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; Since receiving psychological counselling on a regular basis, SCP-2593 has produced expected types of baked goods during its regular deliveries.  At this time, SCP-2593 is considered contained.


------

**Dr. Jamesson&#39;s note:**

//Continued psychological counseling should give SCP-2593 a stable mental state for the foreseeable future.  SCP-2593 is considered contained at this point.  What I would like to stress, however, is that SCP-2593 is an anomaly. Not a person.  Psychological counseling is the easiest way to keep it contained, however, it&#39;s vitally important that we do not relax around SCP-2593, and continue standard security sweeps on its deliveries.  Judging by the initial psychological screening report for James when he was considered for Foundation employment, I would also recommend avoiding agitating SCP-2593.//
[[/tab]]
[[tab Requested interview with Doctor Jamesson]]
On November 22, ████, SCP-2593 confronted Dr. Jamesson, and requested again the use of foundation resources in order to assist the research staff.

&gt; **Dr Jamesson:** James, you requested to speak with me?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2593:** Yeah, doc.  Look, I&#39;ve been delivering everything like usual, but I have nothing to do the rest of the day.  I&#39;ve asked before but I&#39;d really like to help.  I used to do chemistry before I got in to baking, and I think I can help, like, significantly.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Jamesson:** Jimmy, I understand, but we can&#39;t allow you access to our resources like that.  There&#39;s security involved that--
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-2593 appears significantly agitated at this.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2593:** Oh come on!  I&#39;m bored out of my mind, with nothing to think about but bagels, and donuts!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Jamesson:** Jimmy, you were a baker for twenty years, I&#39;m not sure your skills at chemistry are--
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-2593 stands up and slams his hands down on the table//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2593:** I WAS A SCIENTIST GODDAMMIT!  I have a fucking PhD in chemistry!  I&#39;m tired of sitting around. You have to help me, Doctor.  It&#39;s your job!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Jamesson:** Jimmy, calm down. I--
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2593:** I&#39;ve been doing this shit for years now, fucking bagels and donuts, and sandwiches!  I have nothing!  My entire life is wasted on these stupid fucking donuts!  I went to goddamned Cal Fucking Tech!  Doesn&#39;t that mean anything!?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Jamesson:** SCP-2593, calm down, or I&#39;m going to have to call security.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2593:** What did you call me?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Jamesson:** Apologies.  Jimmy, relax.  Come on, there&#39;s no need for this.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2593:** I see.  Sorry doc.  So please.  Even just if I could help find out what happened to me.  I&#39;d really like to just help.  I just need to read some books or something about whatever it is you think happened.  I&#39;m sure I could--
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Jamesson:** No.  Our resources, and materials are restricted.  I&#39;m sorry James, but I really can&#39;t budge on that.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2593:** I see.  I&#39;d like to go back to my room now.
&gt; 
&gt; //Dr Jamesson gestures to the camera//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Jamesson:** Escort them back to their containment chamber, please.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; The next day was the first incident of SCP-2593 delivering baked goods containing toxic substances recorded.

[[tab SCP-2593&#39;s Journal]]

Attached is a log of the journal provided to SCP-2593 to help cope with the stress of containment.

It was recovered from SCP-2593&#39;s containment chamber after the first instance of an unexpected manifestation at a different site.

[[div class=&#34;foldable-list-container&#34;]]
* April 19
 * I was thinking, maybe I could help.  I had an idea the other day, what if we...used like, a really strong glue or something.  It&#39;s been a while, but I managed to dig up some ideas about an old formula I was working on in college.  I think it&#39;ll work
* July 17
 * I think I got it!  I wrote up some notes on the subject, and I think I&#39;m going to ask if Jamesson could give it to the researchers.  I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll let me help, and they&#39;ll see how much I can do.  
[[/div]]

//Dr. Lornth was given SCP-2593&#39;s notes on their compound on August 11.  Dr. Lornth passed it on to the proper departments for analysis. The compound was not only unviable, but that the reaction would actually produce a significant quantity of a toxic gas if attempted as written.//

//Dr. Jamesson was consulted, and this was determined to be simple mistakes on SCP-2593&#39;s part, instead of malice.  Requests for Foundation Resources are to be denied, emphatically, per Dr. Lornth.//

**Dr. Lornth&#39;s note**
//While I appreciate the fact SCP-2593 wants to help, we rejected him 20 years ago when he was fresh out of college.  After all that time, their limited skills have deteriorated further, and the compound that they designed is not only non-viable, but the idea of using glue to prevent manifestation events is farcical.  In an unrelated note, the level of disorganization of these notes shows they don&#39;t have the discipline to actually contribute scientifically to the Foundation.//

[[div class=&#34;foldable-list-container&#34;]]
* August 22
 * They said no.  I can&#39;t beleive they said no!  How could they just ignore my help?!  I gave them that brilliant formula, and they told me it was wrong!  I may have gotten a page mixed up or something, but it had to work.  There&#39;s no way I would have produced something that just didn&#39;t work.  That&#39;s bullshit.
* October 17
 * I keep asking to help, and they won&#39;t let me.  I think I&#39;m gonna put my foot down, and demand it.  Jamesson won&#39;t shoot me down, he&#39;s gotta be a good guy, like George.  He won&#39;t let me down.
* December 20
 *  Those fucking dicks.  They&#39;re gonna pay for this.  I don&#39;t know how, but I&#39;m gonna figure this out.
* April 15
 * I think I figured it out.  If I concentrate, right as I...wake up, I can go wherever I want.  Let&#39;s see how they like it when they get delivered a bunch of Boston Chlorine Methylhydrate Cremes instead.  
[[/div]]

**Dr. Lornth&#39;s Note**
//Chlorine Methylhydrate is not theoretically possible.  Foundation scientists believe this to be, again, another instance of SCP-2593&#39;s deficiencies rather than additional anomalous abilities//
[[/tab]]
[[tab Dr. Jamesson&#39;s Journal]]
Below are relevant excerpts from Dr. Jamessons&#39; personal log and journal regarding SCP-2593.  Following the events on April 7th, SCP-2593 was upgraded from Safe to Euclid.

Following the injury of Dr. Jamesson, SCP-2593 is currently pending Keter designation.

[[div class=&#34;foldable-list-container&#34;]]
* April 24
 * James shows signs of improvement.  He&#39;s been talking less and less about feeling alone, and more about his time while he&#39;s demanifested.  He claims it&#39;s like sleeping.  
* June 7
 * James has shown marked improvement in the last few months, and has begun to view his time de-manifested as &#34;sleep&#34; rather than something to his detriment.
* August 21
 * James has shown interest in the Foundation, and has asked if he could potentially do something during his time while manifested other than sit around and wait to disappear.  I approached Dr. Lornth about this, but the initial assessment of their chemistry skills appears accurate.
* October 14
 * James has insisted repeatedly that he be allowed access to Foundation materials and resources in order to provide some kind of assistance to the Foundation.  This interest is unusually strenuous, and is slightly concerning.  I&#39;ve added a note to his psych profile, and I&#39;ve been trying to gently dissuade James from pursuing the subject.
* December 18
 *  Since a hard denial of SCP-2593&#39;s request to be granted access to Foundation resources on November 4, his conditions have deteriorated.  Several deliveries have been made in error, with similar defects to the initial errors.  When questioned, SCP-2593 said he didn&#39;t know what was happening.
* April 7
 * SCP-2593 has not manifested in four days.  Security personnel have been placed on high alert, and a general notice has been put out to other nearby sites.
* April 16
 * SCP-2593 has been sighted making deliveries to several other Foundation Sites.  Baked goods were shown to contain several toxic compounds.  One injury, zero fatalities, but it&#39;s probably time to upgrade to Euclid.  I&#39;ve made a note to distribute containment protocols regarding deliveries by SCP-2593 to other sites.
* May 1
 * Attempted termination of SCP-2593 has successfully led to containment.  Demanifestation takes place almost immediately after death, and prevents materialization until subsequent mornings.  SCP-2593 is re-contained.  Psychological counseling is obviously to be terminated.  
* No Date Given
 *  I just wanted to help, Jamesson. I wanted to be something more than a fucking donut maker.  I saw your goddamned notes, Jamesson.  Fuck you, and your &#39;Foundation&#39;.  See if I&#39;m good enough now. I hope you enjoy your morning bagel, you son of a bitch.
[[/div]]

**Dr. Lornth&#39;s Note**
//Dr. Jamesson reported to the medical bay, and was diagnosed with Stage 1 liver failure, from Vinyl chloride poisoning, on May 12.  It is highly likely SCP-2593 was involved, considering the entry in Dr. Jamesson&#39;s journal. SCP-2593 is to be considered extremely dangerous at this time.  Upgrade to keter pending.  Thankfully, their previously mentioned issues prevented the compound from being significantly concentrated.  Dr. Jamesson is expected to make a full recovery.//
