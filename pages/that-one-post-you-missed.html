I&#39;ve got a few. Back in I think around 2005, I worked for this one company, Santi Networking. They were based around the southeastern United States, but it was just weird working there. I remember nobody was allowed to physically enter the server rooms of the place I was unless they were switched off, and there were some weird noises coming from them a lot of the time. I think the servers themselves were weird though, there were a few times that some just kind of broke for no reason.

I think I actually know what company that is. Where they the ones that kept just losing people&#39;s information and data? I only know that because there was a lawsuit about it, I think.

That was only half the reason. The other half was that about 2 days before the company closed, a bunch of night shift people went missing. I was working where it happened, and once again they didn&#39;t let anybody into the server room. I could make a separate thread for this one email somebody sent me about what they found in there, but I think I deleted the email a while ago. Besides, I moved away from there right after they closed down. Not many other jobs there.

I did some digging in the wayback machine, and it looks like it was there. I didn&#39;t actually find the sub, though. Only thing I could find was a screenshot of part of the post I think you&#39;re looking for.

@##orange|**Perthward_bound**## There was an edit made at exactly 10:14, but there&#39;s no user registered for who made it. The only other mod online is kneecaps, but they&#39;re dealing with some furry trolling in another thread. You should make sure your account is secure, just to be safe. Same goes for @##red|**birdbrained**## and @##green|**FurryInABlanket**##.

Ok, so the reason I couldn&#39;t post earlier was because I decided to head out to the server myself to see if anything there was related to whatever&#39;s going on here. It was a lot further out from town than I expected, and it was pretty derelict, as expected. It was about 8 floors, and the lower 3 floors were pretty much empty, nothing but some old desks and paperweights somebody forgot to take. The closer I got to the top floor, where the servers were, the more stuff there was left behind. It looked mostly like they had just made everybody leave, except in almost every floor there was a locked file cabinet. I found the key and got them open, but there was nothing but a bunch of burned papers. One of them looked a bit like a printout for the server status, but that was about the only legible thing I found. After floor 5, the doors to the stairs were barricaded shut, but the chairs had rusted away and it was super easy to get up. Floor 6 was virtually untouched, it looked like everybody had just walked out one day. All the computers had their screens smashed in, though. Only thing that didn&#39;t look completely normal about that floor. Floor 7 was absolutely destroyed. Most of the desks that weren&#39;t lying on the wall were smashed to pieces, there were old scorch marks in the floor, all the computers were just bits of plastic and circuits on the board, and it turns out that barricade hadn&#39;t been moved since the night the night shift dissapeared. I found their bodies, mostly scattered all over the floor but with a few grouped near the door to the stairs. I managed to move past them into the server floor, and everything looked like it had been burnt out. A few of the servers looked like they had been smashed with something, but the others all had been set on fire and destroyed. None of them were actually functional, there was no power anywhere and they were all destroyed, but I was pretty sure I could hear something while I was there. Whatever the case, I headed back out, called the cops, talked to them about this, and headed back. I&#39;m not sure what the story is with those guys, but I&#39;m kind of scared to find out.

I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, but all users that get compromised by this are getting banned until they contact mods about it. We don&#39;t need people getting hacked here.

Limp, Perthward sent me some messages saying they weren&#39;t at their computer when that post was made. The post isn&#39;t even on their screen.

Furry, just go and log out of every account you have online. Whatever this is seems to only affect stuff that&#39;s logged in.
