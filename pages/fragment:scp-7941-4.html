    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>+++++ The sleeping pilot of the solar pyre
+++++ was once again immured within his mind.
+++++ An age of dusty silence had begun
+++++ above the slaughterhouse he left behind.
+++++ The Helmsman wished to answer for his crimes.
+++++ No honest judge would grant him clemency.
+++++ But court was held within his looking-glass,
+++++ for judge and jury all were absentee.
+++++ The cruelest judge within donned cap of black,
+++++ and bit his upper lip to temper hate.
+++++ But since the hangmen all had gone extinct,
+++++ &#34;I sentence you, destroyer, to create.&#34;
+++++ ##c4a30b|O Helmsman, Helmsman, of the age untold!##
+++++ ##c4a30b|The one to turn our crimson sun to gold!##
+++++ ##c4a30b|There&#39;s one opponent left within your queue.##
+++++ ##c4a30b|Now, subjugate your cruel oppressor -- you.##
++ ##white|.##
+++++ The Helmsman&#39;s mind was incompatible
+++++ with any answer that would see him live.
+++++ Where was the justice in this strange reward?
+++++ But he had naught to lose and all to give.
+++++ Alas, destruction was his only skill,
+++++ and all the teachers, save himself, retired.
+++++ But growing desperation was the thing
+++++ that made primeval man discover fire.
+++++ Time is the enemy of tyrant gods,
+++++ for when it&#39;s unconstrained, all dreams come true.
+++++ The boulder&#39;s on the hilltop, motionless,
+++++ for Sisyphus had learned a thing or two.
+++++ ##c4a30b|O Helmsman, Helmsman, of the age untold!##
+++++ ##c4a30b|The one to turn our crimson sun to gold!##
+++++ ##c4a30b|Now, let the astral furnace twist and churn,##
+++++ ##c4a30b|and ruin everything until you learn.##
++ ##white|.##
+++++ For eons did the flames eclipse themselves.
+++++ Among the sea of boiling flesh below,
+++++ the melting-pot, once comforting, grew stale.
+++++ The globules scattered, bonds were shattered so.
+++++ The graveyard undulated fiendishly,
+++++ for something in their treasured light was wrong.
+++++ The pseudopod and mitochondria
+++++ began to doubt they&#39;d ever get along.
+++++ Saint Tanner&#39;s dying words had sown a seed.
+++++ that grew into the gift of newfound skin.
+++++ inverting thus the hateful fathers&#39; curse: 
+++++ &#34;I took you from this world -- I&#39;ll bring you in!&#34;
+++++ ##c4a30b|O Helmsman, Helmsman, of the age untold!##
+++++ ##c4a30b|The one to turn our crimson sun to gold!##
+++++ ##c4a30b|The world you knew was given recompense,##
+++++ ##c4a30b|succeeded by eternal innocence.##
++ ##white|.##
+++++ The Helmsman reigns as neither god nor king,
+++++ but silent nurturer and sentinel.
+++++ The ancient paths to global suicide
+++++ all falter under watch of Kent-SauEl.
+++++ The stars will blink to nothing one-by-one
+++++ in worlds past our borders in the sky,
+++++ but Father Helmsman&#39;s sun is elsewhere-born
+++++ from realms where flames are never meant to die.
+++++ And if you ask him if there&#39;s still regret
+++++ within his fifty-billion-year-old mind,
+++++ I&#39;ll bet he&#39;d smile sadly, shrug, and say:
+++++ &#34;This bus ain&#39;t leavin&#39; nobody behind.&#34;
+++++ ##c4a30b|O Helmsman, Helmsman, of the age untold!##
+++++ ##c4a30b|The one who turned our crimson sun to gold!##
+++++ ##c4a30b|Look down upon this gentler place to live in,##
+++++ ##c4a30b|then try to say you&#39;ll never be forgiven.##
