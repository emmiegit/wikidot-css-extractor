+ Special Containment Procedures

SCP-███ is to be held within a specialized airtight humanoid containment chamber. Inspections to identify any structural damage to this chamber must be conducted weekly, and immediately following any attempted containment breach. The usage of cameras or video recording devices in the presence of SCP-███ is strictly prohibited. In the event of a containment breach, all security cameras within Site-19 must be immediately disconnected.

Efforts to identify and contain images of SCP-███ are to be overseen by Dr. Imelda Khan as part of an ongoing effort hereby designated Project MASK.

+ Description

SCP-███ is a pale-skinned, hairless humanoid measuring approximately 2.4 meters in height. Its body proportions are roughly equivalent to those of an adult human male, with the notable exception of its arms, which measure approximately 1.5 meters in length. Despite a pronounced lack of muscle mass, it possesses great strength, and when provoked should be considered extremely dangerous.

Although SCP-███ is normally docile, it will enter a state of extreme emotional distress whenever its face is viewed, whether in person or through a recorded image. When viewed, SCP-███ will cover its face with its hands and emit a series of distressed vocalizations. After several minutes it will invariably attempt to escape its confines, and run in the direction of the person who viewed it. Upon arriving at its target&#39;s location, SCP-███ will proceed to kill its target, whereupon it will return to its previously docile state.

------

++ Addendum ███.01 

As SCP-███’s effect has only been shown to trigger when viewed by humans, containment of images of its face is to be performed entirely through automated processes. Foundation webcrawlers have been fitted with facial recognition software, and through machine learning have developed the ability to identify SCP-███ with 99.8% accuracy from as few as 4 pixels. These programs are to search the Internet, including in cases where such access is prohibited by law, to identify any images containing the face of SCP-███. Foundation AI is to then digitally manipulate these files to remove any pixels containing SCP-███, preventing further spread of its image.

------

++ Addendum ███.02

Although Project MASK has been effective at identifying images of SCP-███, response times have only been fast enough to prevent attempted containment breach in approximately 87% of cases. To alert Foundation staff to any potential breaches, the AI responsible for executing Project MASK has been connected to the Site-19 alarm system. In the event that an image of SCP-███ is identified, the alarm will sound until the image has been effectively censored.

------

++ Addendum ███.03

To prevent confusion among Site-19 staff, a specially designated alarm bell has been installed to signal the identification of an image of SCP-███. This separate alarm serves to distinguish the identification of an image of SCP-███ from general site emergencies. 

------

++ Addendum ███.04

The following conversation was recorded on 2 February 2017 between Site-19 Provisional Director Michael Hammersmith and Senior Archivist Jonah Ginsberg.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Ginsberg:** I trust you’re getting settled in nicely, Director?

**Dir. Hammersmith:** Yes, it’s been quite the transition, but smooth as can be expected. I was just familiarizing myself with the anomalies we have contained on-site. I wanted to check with you because it looks like one of their files was digitized incorrectly. It appears that its identification number was completely redacted.

**Ginsberg:** Yeah, that’s a bug in the new software. It has an auto-redact feature built in to remove personally identifying information. Saves time, but it can get a bit trigger happy with the older files. Should be an easy fix, though. Which anomaly is it?

**Dir. Hammersmith:** That’s just it, the number is redacted.

**Ginsberg:** Can you describe it?

**Dir. Hammersmith:** Well, I don’t know his name, but his face rings a bell.
