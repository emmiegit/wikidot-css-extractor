**Special Containment Procedures:** The Interstellar Anomaly Unit (IAU) is in charge of every operation regarding SCP-6695.

**Description:** SCP-6695 is a spherical megastructure, often referred to as &#34;The Aeris Outpost&#34; by its inhabitants, that encompasses BPM-37093[[footnote]] A variable white dwarf star composed primarily of crystallized carbon and oxygen.[[/footnote]]. It is not visible through conventional means, including direct observation via telescope or other non-anomalous equipment. SCP-6695 is composed of several orbiting panels that collectively have a total area of 50 000 000 square kilometers. SCP-6695 is inhabited by an alien civilization focused on both religious and economic interests. Most members of this civilization identify themselves as followers of the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/second-hytoth-hub Ortothan Religion].

SCP-6695-A, also known as &#34;Tomorrow Diamonds&#34;, refers to a manufactured product built from the resources of BPM-37093. SCP-6695-A instances are being sold across civilizations in the Milky Way by an extraterrestrial business known as PARAGON.co. This company is comprised of several Ortothan merchants devoted to a deity known as Yorun-leusan. SCP-6695-A instances are charged with high amounts of nuclear energy without any successful estimated measures.

**Addendum 6695.1:** On 1994/05/03 at 15:23, the IAU received an anomalous radio signal originating from a distance of 50 light-years, within the Centaurus Constellation. No delay was perceived despite the distance.

//&lt;Dr. Warner is at his office, performing his regular assignments. His radio is tuned to a music radio station when the signal is intercepted and replaced.&gt;//

**PARAGON.co:** This is PARAGON.co, do you read me?

//&lt;Dr. Warner ignores it, mistaking it for a song gimmick.&gt;//

**PARAGON.co:** This is PARAGON.co speaking to the Interstellar Anomaly Unit of the SCP Foundation, do you copy?

//&lt;Dr. Warner grabs his microphone and adjusts the frequency to match the radio.&gt;//

**Dr. Warner:** Yes, I can hear you.

**PARAGON.co:** Excellent. We request to discuss business with you.

**Dr. Warner:** Hold on, slow down. Who am I speaking with, exactly?

**PARAGON.co:** My apologies. I am the representative of PARAGON.co, a business that aims to help Yorun-leusan defeat the Voruteut once and for all. We sell our products to every corner of the galaxy.

**Dr. Warner:** Um, right. Can you hold on for a minute?

**PARAGON.co:** Of course.

**Dr. Warner:** Edna! I need help here!

**Dr. Kowal:** Otto? What’s wrong?

**Dr. Warner:** We have… um... a visitor.

**PARAGON.co:** Ah, Edna Kowal. I’ve heard about you.

**Dr. Kowal:** Who is this? How do you know me?

**PARAGON.co:** Let’s just say we have been keeping an eye on you and the Foundation. Are you perhaps familiar with Ortothans, miss?

**Dr. Kowal:** That’s doctor to you. I have met some believers but I know little about the religion itself.

**PARAGON.co:** I’ll give you two an abridged version, for the sake of business. We, Ortothans share admiration for the Koru-teusa who defend us against the terrors of the Voruteut. We sacrifice our blood to keep Yorun-leusan and Rakmou-leusan alive and healthy.

**Dr. Warner:** (mumbling) What the hell?

**Dr. Kowal:** You sacrifice your blood?

**PARAGON.co:** The Koru-teusa have ascended to godhood but they’re still mortal like us. They need blood to survive, we provide it to them.

**Dr. Warner:** If this is true, why are you contacting us?

**PARAGON.co:** We simply wish to discuss business, of course. We seek knowledge that you possess and we offer our product in exchange for it.

**Dr. Kowal:** Can you be more precise?

**PARAGON.co:** Absolutely. I have prepared a document with all the information you need. Presented in terrestrial fashion, of course. Expect it in the next few days.

//&lt;Communication with PARAGON.co ends abruptly.&gt;//

**Dr. Warner:** Terrestrial?

//&lt;There is no answer.&gt;//

**Dr. Warner:** Hello?

**Dr. Kowal:** I think the connection has been lost.

**Dr. Warner:** Damn it. What’s up with that guy?

//&lt;Dr. Kowal shrugs.&gt;//

**Dr. Kowal:** We should locate where this signal came from.

**Dr. Warner:** What about protocol?

**Dr. Kowal:** Otto. You of all people should not give a shit about protocol.

**Dr. Warner:** I’m sorry.

**Dr. Kowal:** Don’t apologize. We are still the directors of this department, we decide how we do things.

Approximately 36 hours following the previous interview, an unidentified object entered Earth&#39;s atmosphere and landed on the entrance to the IAU&#39;s offices. The object was suspected to be the equivalent of a cargo vehicle in the form of a spacecraft. It left a 0.6 cubic meter box composed of an unknown type of wood before leaving our planet. Each side of the box had &#34;PARAGON.co&#34; written over it.

Inside the box, there was an SCP-6695-A instance with a weight of 10 kilograms. Analysis of the SCP-6695-A instance confirmed the presence of high amounts of nuclear energy with it.
