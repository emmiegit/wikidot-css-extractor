**Special Containment Procedures:** Current containment efforts focus on the implementation of an international counseling program designated &#34;Specialized Counselors and Psychiatrists.&#34; Agents that discover instances of SCP-4958 are encouraged to converse with the individuals referred to in SCP-4958&#39;s notes. Said individuals should seek counseling or be reunited with their loved ones.

**Description:** SCP-4958 refers to //Lycoris radiata// (more commonly known as red spider lilies) that bloom near individuals who have had a major conflict with their loved ones. SCP-4958 is distinguished from normal //Lycoris radiata// in that it blooms only on inorganic matter, such as tiled floors. Each instance of SCP-4958 contains a folded piece of paper.

The paper contains a short handwritten letter directed towards the individual, which is written in their native language. The handwriting matches that of a person whom the individual had a major dispute with. Should an instance be uprooted, but the conflict has not been resolved, another instance will bloom within a month with a different message. 

&gt;  **Excerpt of Log of Known SCP-4958 Occurrences**
&gt; 
&gt; **Below are some of the earliest notes retrieved by the Foundation. The rest have been truncated for brevity.**
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** 6-year-old female
&gt; **Background:** Subject was found in a public park after leaving a foster home due to bullying. Handwriting matched subject&#39;s former caretaker.
&gt; **Note:** //Juliana, I&#39;m sorry for not hearing you out. Please come back, we miss you.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** 16-year-old female
&gt; **Background:** Subject&#39;s parents divorced. Lives with father but chooses to minimize interaction with either parent. Handwriting matched subject&#39;s mother.
&gt; **Note:** //My little Lilian, I hope Jeremy is taking good care of you. I know he won&#39;t forgive me for running off, but know that momma loves you, okay?//
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** 18-year-old male
&gt; **Background:** Subject was subject to abuse from parents and siblings. After the death of parents, subject refused to leave home or interact with his siblings. Handwriting matched subject&#39;s eldest brother.
&gt; **Note:** //Daniel, look. I won&#39;t try to mince words. We were assholes. I get it. Yell at me if you want, hit me, whatever. I don&#39;t care. Just don&#39;t shut me out, man. Speak to me.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** 87-year-old female
&gt; **Background:** Subject was estranged from children following a dispute over her children&#39;s support of the LGBTQ community. Subject was found having been deceased for over two weeks, with the SCP-4958 instance looking noticeably withered. Handwriting matches subject&#39;s son.
&gt; **Note:** //Mom, we won&#39;t try to convince your mind over Trevor&#39;s choice. Please come over for Thanksgiving, it&#39;s been years since he last saw you.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** 64-year-old male
&gt; **Background:** Subject was prone to drunken fits of rage, eventually culminating in his wife leaving. Subject was aware of SCP-4958, having collected an estimated twenty eight notes before the Foundation noticed. Despite having written to his wife various times, he never received a response. Both parties were administered amnestics.
&gt; **Note:** //I want to say I still love you, but I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll lash out again. Even I have limits on my patience, Herb.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** 20-year-old male
&gt; **Background:** Subject diagnosed as suffering from social anxiety after dropping out of college due to financial issues. Handwriting matched subject&#39;s father.
&gt; **Note:** //Hey champ. I know mom and I weren&#39;t exactly too happy when we heard that you dropped out. But, well... if you ever need a warm place to stay, just come on over. Pops will fix you a hot meal.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** 25-year-old male
&gt; **Background:** Subject was D-9588, who was kept in an isolated containment cell due to testing with an unrelated SCP. Diagnosed with Antisocial Personality Disorder. Handwriting matched subject&#39;s deceased sister.
&gt; **Note:** //We&#39;ll get through this together, Ellis.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** 25-year-old male
&gt; **Background:** Subject was D-9588. Subject had declined an interview regarding the contents of the previous SCP-4958 instance, although he admitted feeling nostalgic after reading the former message. Handwriting matched subject&#39;s deceased sister.
&gt; **Note:** //We forgive you. Come visit us one day.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** 25-year-old male
&gt; **Background:** Subject was D-9588. Subject had declined an interview once more. Subject was initially distressed at reading the second instance of SCP-4958 but afterwards admitted he felt relieved. After reading the third instance, subject&#39;s mood greatly improved. Subject was later found deceased after disregarding orders when testing resumed. Handwriting matched subject&#39;s deceased sister.
&gt; **Note:** //Times may be tough, Ellis, but don&#39;t forget: you are loved. Even if the flower means abandonment and death, we won&#39;t leave you behind.//

**Addendum 4958-1:** Four months after the implementation of &#34;Specialized Counselors and Psychiatrists,&#34; all Foundation personnel involved reported an instance of SCP-4958 growing on their desks. Currently, investigations are ongoing to determine if this constitutes a breach of secrecy. All instances had the same note, typed in Gothic font. 

&gt; //Let me have my fun.//
