    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Item #:** SCP-5623

**Object Class:** Pending

**Special Containment Procedures:** All deep-space observatories are to be monitored by remote sensing and imaging satellites in low Earth orbit. 

The production and trade of new deep-space telescopes and satellites has been limited to companies where a sufficient number of undercover Foundation personnel are present in order to successfully implant a Binary_Star.aic file in all related hardware.

All images of SCP-5623 are to be intercepted by the Foundation AI &#34;Binary Star&#34;, saved in the Foundation database, and subsequently deleted from public records. Those who witness the anomaly are to be administered Class B amnestics.

**Description:** SCP-5623 is the first extraterrestrial spacecraft observed by the Foundation and was discovered 54 years before the first manmade spacecraft[[footnote]]The first satellite, Sputnik 1 was launched on 4 October 1957.[[/footnote]] and 57 years before the first manned spacecraft[[footnote]]The first manned spaceflight took place on 12 April 1961 when Yuri Gagarin was launched as part of the Vostok 1 mission.[[/footnote]] existed. SCP-5623 has a frame in the form of an oblate spheroid with an outer chamber on the bottom side which presumably serves as a control room.

**Discovery:** On 28 August 1903, Foundation Astronomers observed SCP-5623 near the Orion Nebula in the Milky Way Galaxy through a telescope. 

SCP-5623 has not been sighted since its discovery by any telescope or spatial equipment. Other cosmic phenomena have led Foundation Astronomers to hypothesize that SCP-5623 was pulled in by the gravity of a red dwarf star and upon impact, ceased to exist alongside the star. 

The proposal to change its object class to neutralized is still pending.
