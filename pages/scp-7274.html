**Special Containment Procedures:** A D-class infected with SCP-7274 [[footnote]]designated as SCP-7274-1 [[/footnote]] is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, fitted with sprinklers and CO2 fire suppression systems in both the chamber itself and surrounding hallways. D-class selected to be SCP-7274-1 are under no circumstances to have a history of pyromania or a habit of smoking, and ideally picked from D-Class with pyrophobia or an aversion to fire to decrease the risk of SCP-7274 outbreaks. 

Creation of an SCP-7274-1 instance is performed via ingestion or transfusion of SCP-7274 infected blood, all blood taken from an SCP-7274-1 instance after 1 week of infection is classed as infected blood and should be handled carefully. Blood taken from an SCP-7274-1 instance is no longer considered infected after a month, even when frozen, the same goes for dead instances of SCP-7274. 
Any breakout events of SCP-7274 are to be contained by a joint task force of MTF-Epsilon 9 (&#34;fire eaters&#34;) and either MTF Epsilon-6 (&#34;Village Idiots&#34;) or MTF Pi-1 (&#34;City Slickers&#34;) depending on the location of the outbreak. With any injured by an instance of SCP-7274 taken in as SCP-7274-1 for experimentation or execution, with appropriate cover stories for their disappearance to be given as necessary. 

Under no circumstance is an SCP-7274-1 instance to be brought into contact with any open flame, or any object hot enough to deliver second-degree burns or worse, this extends to corpses of SCP-7274-1 instances who have not undergone a breakout event, in order to prevent such a breakout event occurring.

**Description:** SCP-7274 is a bloodborne parasite, which upon infecting a host, begins to eat and functionally replace cardiovascular tissue. SCP-7274 appears functionally identical to the original tissue, to the point of being undetectable outside of a breakout event. SCP-7274 has small barbed teeth at the end of each of its appendages, which enables it to keep in contact with the veins and arteries as it consumes them. This allows for uninterrupted blood flow as the host&#39;s veins, capillaries, and arteries are replaced. 

SCP-7274 has no known sensory organs, however, it reacts violently to heat, and appears able to seek out humans and other living organisms. When the host is burned, SCP-7274 tears through their skin, and aggressively attacks everything in its vicinity, killing and harming those around it in what is known as a breakout event. No other method has been found to cause a &#34;breakout event&#34; in SCP-7274-1 instances.

During a breakout event, SCP-7274&#39;s mass of capillaries, veins, and arteries are of a strength comparative to steel cables. After removing itself from the hosts body, it then rampages in this state until it expires.  SCP-7274 instances are able to dismember people easily and damage most buildings and structures with the strength and speed of their tendrils. 

Infection of SCP-7274 can occur from any blood contact from SCP-7274-1; testing shows it takes on average 1 week to replace a limb&#39;s worth of vascular tissue, and after a month is able to replace up to half of the host&#39;s cardiovascular system. Fully replacing the veins, heart, capillaries, and arteries within two months, at which point the SCP-7274 instance is fully grown, and remains dormant for the rest of the host&#39;s lifespan unless a breakout event occurs. In which case the SCP-7274 instance can remain active for up to 24 hours before expiring.

**Discovery:** SCP-7274 was first discovered on 23.05.21 after an SCP-7274-1 instance from Quebec was cremated, inciting a breakout event, killing 19 people attending the funeral before expiring. Three weeks later, a sealed underground research facility was discovered in the South of England when Foundation staff investigated rumours of anomalous research being conducted in the area. 

When searched by SCP personnel, 20 dead instances of SCP-7274 were found along many of the corridors, amongst many more human corpses. The site appeared to have gone into a lockdown preventing exit or external communications. Upon further investigation, it was found the site computer had kept records of various emails, data logs, and security footage from both before and after the lockdown. 

The recovered data indicated the facility to be the origin of SCP-7274, upon this discovery the SCP-7274 file was updated and efforts to locate and contain potential SCP-7274-1 instances are currently ongoing. A record of the related documents recovered from this &#34;digital black box&#34; has been attached below:

**Finished formula report**
//RachelWalters@▇▇▇.co.uk//
[11.07.20]
Dear Dr. Mulligan

I have confirmed the success of the current cure formula, and it has now been approved for final human trials. Once administered it should be able to prevent internal bleeding in a patient from any cause due to its separate immune system and increased regeneration speed, and unlike traditional organ transplants, there is no possibility of tissue rejection. 

I have included the formula in document-P945-1 for when you submit it to the directors and patent board, as long as this last batch of patients doesn&#39;t experience any issues during the final trial period, we should be able to release the product.

When you&#39;re done with that, let&#39;s celebrate this success over some drinks at mine later.
Regards,
Dr. Walters.

**Subject final observation period**
//M&amp;M@▇▇▇.co.uk//
[12.07.20]

Dear Dr. Walters,

I congratulate you on the success with the most recent formula, I have submitted document-P945-1 alongside the latest progress reports and am currently processing the patients for the final observation period, our three subjects and conditions are: 

David Canard (//23//) (Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome)
Brixton Jones (//40//) (Buerger&#39;s disease)
Hanna Mayland (//56//) (Peripheral artery disease) 

Theoretically, this treatment should cure or significantly weaken the effects of all of these issues, and a collection of more otherwise incurable vascular diseases.
P.S: I’ve made sure they’ve been given name tags so you don’t forget their names during checkups, they’ll be staying in the facility underground for a while so try not to upset them?

Thank you for the update and the drinks offer, I’ll take you up on that. 
from, 
Dr. Mulligan.

**Update on observations**
//RachelWalters@▇▇▇.co.uk//
[15.08.20]

Dear Dr. Mulligan,

The observation period has ended, and the results seem to be stellar, Hanna’s peripheral artery disease has all but disappeared, David no longer displays symptoms of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, and Brixton has shown no signs of any issues since treatment. 

I am currently in the process of acquiring their personal effects before they are discharged, can you print the NDAs for them to sign?  It&#39;s normally Dr. Xanders&#39; job, but they&#39;ve taken time off to look after their sick mother.  
Congratulations are in order,
Dr. Walters.

//A video plays of the time directly after the patients retrieved their personal effects, in what appears to be an entrance room or reception. As Dr. Mulligan leaves the room, presumably to retrieve the NDAs from Dr. Walters, the patient Brixton is seen going to smoke.//

//After cupping their hand to light a cigarette, back facing the rest of the group, they shout in pain and begin to convulse violently. Their body appears to rip itself apart, limbs contorting unnaturally and their neck snapping, as an instance of SCP-7274 tears itself free from the now flayed corpse of Brixton. A dripping red bundle of thin tendrils extending to the surrounding surfaces, with a partially formed heart in the centre, appearing to beat sporadically.//

//The SCP-7274 instance subsequently begins to rampage around the room, spinning and slashing at everything it can, it is seen to dismember and kill the other patients and the staff around them, before going off camera.//


Data records show that the SCP-7274 instance went on to kill seven other employees and injured another 12 before ceasing all movement and expiring in a southern hallway in the middle of the site. During the chaos, a staff member at the reception started the site lockdown sealing the facility, before the log says they were disemboweled by the SCP-7274 instance, which also destroyed the console she used.

If you knew this was something it could do, if you had even the //slightest indication// that this was a possibility you&#39;re as good as dead, and that&#39;s not coming from me. We have so many people in this building alone that want explanations, even forgetting the rest of their loved ones you have a lot of explaining to do.

**Dr. Walters:** I didn&#39;t do anything! We were working with tech we barely understood, you knew that as well as I did, besides it&#39;s your fault just as much as it is mine. For now, we just need to focus on making sure it doesn&#39;t get worse! we&#39;ve got 12 people critically injured by that thing, and we still need to do an autopsy on it. Now I&#39;m happy for you to help with either one of these, as long as you don&#39;t get in my way!

//I will preface this report by explaining the method used to create this cure, for any unfamiliar and wondering how such a thing could be made accidentally both inside and outside of the organisation.// 

//The site here had been built around an underground &#34;supercomputer&#34; that the founders knew about, we didn&#39;t know where it came from or who made it, and we were not allowed to ask. All we knew is it had a console to enter concepts into which were implemented, apparently limitlessly. When it is said we did not understand the technology we were working with, that is no understatement.//

**Anomaly autopsy, by Dr. Mulligan**

**Overview:** The creature is visibly identical to a human vascular system, with increased durability.
The main discernible differences are certain missing portions from what would be the legs and lower torso, as well as sections of the heart, the other primary differences being the strength and resistance to breaking of all parts of the creature, and presence of microscopic teeth at some ends, presumably to connect to the rest of the cardiovascular system as it grows.


**Veins, Capillaries, Arteries:** Primary differences compared to a human&#39;s cardiovascular system are the presence of microscopic teeth at some ends where the parasite appeared to be still growing, alongside increased durability, making it difficult to cut, with a strength comparable to steel wire. No changes were present in its anatomy to explain these features. 
 
**Heart:** The heart has also been replicated in the same way as the veins and arteries. Though it appears impartial, and upon referencing the host remains it appears that the parts which are not present in the creature were left in their body- along with the veins and arteries present in their lower legs. The heart has the same increased durability as the other parts of the organism. Once again the organism showed no anatomical difference compared to a normal human heart.

**Presence of microscopic teeth:** The unfinished edges of the creature&#39;s heart and ends of unfinished veins and arteries appear to have microscopic teeth on them, presumably used to keep in contact with the parts of the vascular system yet to be consumed.

//-End of file//

[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
 **Autopsy analysis:** The cure the three of them were administered was from the same batch made by the computer. Meaning both Hanna and David were carriers of the same parasite. Knowing this, it is a safe assumption that something &#34;activated&#34; or angered the one present in Brixton, causing it to attack and lash out. The CCTV footage of the site is encrypted so I can&#39;t review it for any clues. If we can figure it out, we will be able to better understand the creature, and discover if it is an issue likely to repeat itself.

The date on the footage is one week after the start of the lockdown. Voices can be heard from outside the camera&#39;s perspective joking and laughing. The guard is struggling against his injury in order to cook, and eventually drops a wooden spoon into the pan.//

//He immediately reaches to grab it, before flinching and shouting an expletive. The people off camera stop their conversations and ask if he is okay (revealing his name to be Spencer). Spencer begins to convulse, and his limbs contort while screaming in pain, similar to what was seen from Brixton. After a few moments of panicked shouting from those outside the camera view, and a series of screams of pain from Spencer. A second, smaller instance of SCP-7274 emerges from the injured arm and shoulder of Spencer, before proceeding to gut him and move off camera, presumably towards the other nearby staff members. Screams of pain are heard off camera and blood covers the camera lens before the footage stops and the video ends.//


Data attached to the file states &#34;Four researchers were killed and three more injured before security staff and Dr. Walters incapacitated the anomaly with a fire-axe. Walters was able to sever several larger tentacles from the main mass while the anomaly was at a barricaded door. She was then able to pin the remaining mass to the floor using the fire-axe.

**URGENT**
[21.08.20]
//RachelWalters@▇▇▇.co.uk//
I&#39;ll cut to the chase, this thing can spread. Maybe that&#39;s the only reason it lashed out in the first place. It might only need to injure a person to infect them, and in case you haven&#39;t noticed, the number of injured is rising. We need to figure out if there&#39;s a trigger for this thing, and whether there&#39;s a way to kill them before they &#34;get out of someone&#34; and cause more damage.
If you&#39;ve got any ideas or found a way to access the CCTV footage, then I&#39;m all ears.

I still can&#39;t access the CCTV footage as the main console was destroyed, and that was the only intended access for on-site staff. But I have a lead, a lighter was found in the reception room of the first incident, and Spencer&#39;s corpse was next to a lit gas stove. My guess is that fire, or burning yourself, triggers the creature to try and escape in an act of self-preservation. Not that I want to try this out of course, but tell everyone you can that the injured are to stay away from any open flames,  including the kitchen and labs in their entirety.

 I&#39;m going to go down to The Computer that made this thing and see if I can work on a cure, I know you were in charge of the creation of it, and you should probably be the one to do this. But the staff need a leader, and you&#39;ve always been better with words than I. Besides, I do have the most experience with this thing from other projects. 

I&#39;m going to lock myself down here, no one left but you and I know of this room, and it&#39;s our only way of opening up the place or curing it, we can&#39;t have anyone else getting in here.
I hope you understand,
Mulligan.

Michael, is there any update on the cure? Our food is running low and everyone&#39;s getting anxious, you&#39;ve been holed up with The Computer for over two weeks now, I&#39;m worried. I know that thing can keep you alive from the documentation on it, but I want to know you&#39;re okay.

There can be no cure, I&#39;m sure of it now. The Computer deals with concepts, and conceptually that thing we have created /is// a cure, and either I or it cannot grasp the concept of curing a cure. 
This means there is no way to remove it. The computer just returns error after error, and when I try some stuff looking at the result makes me vomit or lose hours of memory.

 Point is, if there is a way to undo this, it is probably more dangerous than what we have right now. I know that&#39;s saying something, but I fear it&#39;s the truth now I begin to understand the full extent of this machine, this thing is dangerous, with the wrong person and the wrong goals things so much worse than what we have created could occur. But I am sorry to say that as to our current problem, there is no hope for those already infected. I leave the decision of what to do in your hands, while I deal with this.

//The crowd&#39;s attention is diverted from Dr. Walters with this comment, the speaker looks wide-eyed and afraid at the silence, realising what they said. Before he can say another word one of the injured staff members punch him in the jaw. After this the crowd turns into a brawl, some people fighting and others attempting to restrain those trying to attack others. Dr. Walters is seen assisting those trying to stop the brawl before the video ends.//

I&#39;m sure you heard about what happened when I broke the news to the staff. After we broke up the fight a lot of injured staff got paranoid that we would &#34;get rid of them&#34; so that the rest of us could leave. They&#39;ve barricaded themselves into the east wing and main reception, I know we can&#39;t just let the people that&#39;re infected out into the world, the potential danger that poses is immense. But I don&#39;t know what else to do, Logically I know the choice best for the world, but I can not allow such actions toward my staff, my friends. I definitely can&#39;t sanction such actions myself.

Please, I can&#39;t keep a hold of this situation alone.

They won&#39;t be able to get out, the engineers told me when they installed those quarantine doors that they&#39;re an inch thick solid steel between the rest of the facility and the elevator shaft to the surface. They will be too afraid of the consequences of using a blowtorch, and with the console destroyed that&#39;s the only way out.

 Of course, they might not be attempting to get out at all, just making sure the rest of you don&#39;t abandon them here. The fate of many lives is not something I can decide like that, we both know the decision that is right for the world at large, the infected staff can not leave this facility. While I know this, I do not have the resolve to make such a decision, it is not one you or I can make alone or half-hearted.

I still can&#39;t leave The Computer yet. As we cannot cure it, we run the risk of being unable to contain it, thereby we need a method of detection. So far I&#39;ve got nothing, but if we don&#39;t figure this out, the entire world could become a lot worse from our mistake. 

It is important to remember, however, that maybe it doesn&#39;t infect as easily as we thought. Or worse, it is more infectious, I recommend holding out as long as possible so we can be sure who is infected, if we have to weigh lives I don&#39;t want to send anyone to their death that doesn&#39;t need to, nor do I want to make all these sacrifices for nothing by letting someone infected out after all of this.
 
I won&#39;t be able to respond for a while, the latest thing I&#39;m trying will temporarily cut communications between The Computer and the site as a whole. In the meantime, I want to say that I am sorry for bringing you into this project. If I had even thought it to have been dangerous I wouldn&#39;t have asked you to join.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+East wing CCTV footage [05.10.20]&#34; hide=&#34;-hide CCTV footage&#34;]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
//A large group of people, including many injured, can be seen crowded in the room. Many of them are talking amongst themselves, while others stare into the distance quietly, some fiddling with various things.//

//A younger woman with dark braids and a bandaged stump of an arm, wheels a trolley into the hall. Before turning it over and standing on it, addressing the crowd:// 



**Female Researcher:**“Can I have your attention please!”

//A lot of the group stop what they&#39;re doing, and turn to listen to her.// 

**Female Researcher:**“My name is Becca, one of the junior scientists at the site, and I thought I should speak up, as no one else in our group has, about what Rachel and Michael have been telling us.
We are all here because we were injured by one of those things, and that makes the rest think we are a threat to them. 
They want us to stay isolated, so it isn’t their problem! 
Rachel claims, that it is a disease, that it has spread to us through our injuries, and that is what happened to our Spencer.”

//The speaker stops for a second, looking sombrely at their feet, before carrying on.//

**Becca:** “But I say, have we ever heard of such a thing? that was clearly some kind of creature, a monster, why are they assuming the injury is what got it to Spencer?” 

//More people begin to pay attention to the speaker as she says this, some standing up to get a better view.//

**Becca:** “For all we know Spencer was exposed to the original serum, and was infected then!”

//Many in the crowd begin to murmur in agreement, while one older worker, appearing to be a janitor stands up and begins to speak.//

**Janitor:** “So yer sure that the rest of us aren’t infected? Ye think if I were to burn ma-self like the other two we would be fine?” 

//The man says this with a raised voice, before brandishing an antique Zippo-style lighter and continuing.//

**Janitor:** “I’m tired, tired of this damn hole, tired of this damn death sentence they’ve placed upon me. If you say there’s a chance I can leave here and get to my family, I’ll take that chance, Becca.“

//The woman, Becca, and the rest of the group all freeze staring at the man, before saying.//

**Becca:** &#34;You understand it isn’t a total certainty right - Mark ?&#34;

**Mark:** &#34;I’m aware, and I’m quite fond of ye’all so I don’t want to risk your lives. But I am old, I don’t want to spend the rest of my life here, it&#39;s already been too long. So I’ve made up my mind, and I will not be swayed from this path.&#34;

//The man, Mark is seen making his way towards the door, as he does, another older researcher, who previously was ignoring Becca&#39;s speech, is seen slowly raising a gun towards Mark. Nobody in the room moves to stop him until Becca notices as Mark opens the door.//

**Becca:** &#34;WAIT!&#34; 



[Mark Spins round as the researcher fires, missing him and hitting a gas pipe on the wall opposite the door, at the same time Mark turns on the taser to threaten the researcher to stand down, after a few seconds of screaming and shouting across the whole room, the lighter ignites the gas leaking from the fuel line, and a fireball rips through, causing several instances of SCP-7274 to emerge from the people in and near the blast.

Screams are heard as bodies are seen contorting unnaturally, Mark&#39;s neck snaps itself before An SCP-7274 instance pulls free from his body. Footage ends as many instances of SCP-7274 exit the room rapidly, leaving the remaining injured trapped by the flames at the door.] 


The CCTV footage switches cameras to that of the uninjured survivors, where Rachel Walters is seen handing out food and chatting with various survivors before a rumble is felt and distant screams are heard. 


**Rachel:** &#34;Barricade the doors! We can&#39;t let it in! Get anything sharp or large to attack them, and if all you have is a gun, aim for the centre, or the heart!&#34;

//People move quickly to push various objects against the door and in front of the windows, some are already wearing riot gear and move up to the front holding axes and improvised shields, Rachel moves some of the older members away from the windows.//

**Rachel:** &#34;It&#39;s nearly here! Get ready to take it down! &#34;



//After saying this, an instance of SCP-7274 collides with the barricaded door, as several people work to block and dismember it, other instances of SCP-7274 collide with the windows and begin to break through, one of the guards is dismembered and another decapitated.// 

//Several researchers begin screaming and crying, before the SCP-7274 instances break through the windows and doors, entering the room. The people inside are seen being sliced apart by 5-9 instances of SCP-7274 before the camera is covered in blood entirely.//

//After a short period of time, the screaming dies out, leaving only the squelching and whipping sounds of SCP-7274 instances rampaging unseen. This also fades as several instances of SCP-7274 appear to move away in different directions after some time.//


//The CCTV footage swaps back to the East Wing, where the room is seen to be full of smoke, several corpses, some complete, and remains from SCP-7274 are seen motionless before the video ends.//

//A video message plays. In it, a haggard-looking Dr. Mulligan is seen sitting at a desk in front of the camera.//

Well, I don&#39;t know what to say really, this is likely the last message that will be recorded here, which makes it important, kinda. 

//2 minutes of silence, Dr. Mulligan stares into the distance.//

I- had a handgun in my desk drawer. The higher-ups gave it to me back when I became head of the facility, thought it was a sick joke.
I grabbed it this morning, for the first time...

//Mulligan is seen fiddling with a Zippo lighter, traces of blood can be seen on it.//

Checked the site with it, couldn&#39;t find anyone - anyone alive. 

//Mulligan lights the lighter and places it on the table.//

That makes me the last one here, I have the ability to get out now, with time at least, but one thing remains.

//Mulligan lifts a handgun into view of the camera and places it against his head.//

I need to be sure I can go out there, with a clear conscience.

If this is the last I&#39;m heard of, I want to say that I&#39;m sorry. I never meant for this, the responsibility falls on me. Rachel, everyone, I love you all from the bottom of my heart, no one deserves this.

//Mulligan places his hand over the flame of the lighter, and braces himself as the video ends.//

**END OF RECOVERED DOCUMENTS**
[[/collapsible]]

[[/div]]

Upon investigation of these documents, Dr. Xanders mentioned in the initial email logs was located and upon questioning, found to have administered a dose of the SCP-7274 &#34;cure&#34; to their mother, who was reportedly suffering from a life-threatening case of fibromuscular dysplasia. Xanders reported they did it in this way due to their mother&#39;s short life expectancy, her doctors only expecting her to live another week at most.

The cure solved their mother&#39;s  Fibromuscular dysplasia and other various illnesses, and Xanders cut all contact with the facility in order to avoid repercussions. Since then their mother has shown no related health issues, however, she has donated blood several times before Foundation involvement, tracking of the infected blood and its recipients is deemed a high priority to contain SCP-7274.

Dr. Xanders is to be transferred to Foundation custody, as either a doctor working on the SCP-7274 containment project due to their experience working alongside anomalous technologies and their involvement in the development of SCP-7274 or D-class personnel pending O5 approval.
