[[collapsible show=&#34;SCP-4534&#34; hide=&#34;The first&#34;]]
This is it. My Magnum Opus. And you know what? It did actually feel that way! After 5 months of work on this concept (I joined the site because of this idea), 1 failed post (I got impatient and just wanted to see how it&#39;d do in a half-done state) and many, many times of thinking &#34;I should finish that sometime&#34; I had finally gotten my first SCP up on the site. And it got +50 in under a week. That was amazing, and I still feel truly grateful for all the help I got for it. More info regarding its conception is in the author post.

[[collapsible show=&#34;SCP-4714&#34; hide=&#34;The unicorn&#34;]]
This one was written by [[*user DevonMartin]] together with me for CollabCon 2k19. It started out as a standalone idea Devon already had, then turned into something extremely convoluted including MC&amp;D until we took a step back and revamped it, removing MC&amp;D and making it much simpler.

[[collapsible show=&#34;SCP-4354&#34; hide=&#34;The tattoos&#34;]]
Had this idea only a few days after the first one. The first one was actually the snake, which had me thinking about how the flesh would peel off of the subject&#39;s arm like that. From there, I thought about where I could push and anomaly like this and had the idea of the subjects late grandmother growing out of their body, but ending up as a corpse. From there my thought went to... but what if it created something it probably shouldn&#39;t, something the Foundation would probably struggle to deal with? 

This led me to the actual Jesus Christ, Son of God, and with it the idea of expungement as the punchline. At this point my idea was still that all produced things are incinerated, thus hinting at what&#39;s happening at the ending. I found that a bit boring though, both in how it leaves less room for interpretation and for what it says about this Foundation. So, in the end I took that out, had the tone become more wholesome (the grandma turned into the children) and also changed my personal headcanon for what is behind that expungement. NO hints though, this is 100% for the reader to decide.

[[collapsible show=&#34;SCP-4376&#34; hide=&#34;The bad advice&#34;]]

I wrote this one at my old job on the toilet on my phone because I was pissed off at my boss and at my brain and the interaction between em. 
Basically, the defining emotion for this is spite. Spite at people that don&#39;t understand mental illness, spite at smart asses, spite at shitty exes and spite at their bad advice. 

This has been very interesting in how controversial it was for many readers. Some did not get it, others got it but got nothing out of it, while some really liked it. (Which I am very happy about.)

Either way this was pretty cathartic and I am glad it seems to be stable in votes.

This was super fun to wrote over almost half a year. Lots of thought went into it and it changed a lot over time. I was a bit unsure at first when the idea came up to build this up past just the simple anomaly (which I always really liked), but I am super proud of the final product.

This is the Prequel to SCP-4714 and was done in a similar fashion. As explained in the author page Devon had to do most of the work here (and also did a great job at it) and I am really thankful he stuck with me through such a turmoiled writing process. I feel a bit of shame to put this here as I would have really liked to leave more of my own mark on it, but I am still proud of the end product.
