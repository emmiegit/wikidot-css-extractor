**Item #:** SCP-3616

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** A number of informants have been introduced into various literary communities and popular meeting places for such groups. Foundation operatives are also to take part in conventions and other events connected with literature and the science-fiction genre. These agents are to be briefed on all known appearances of SCP-3616 and are to report all suspected individuals who may be or have come into contact with SCP-3616. Web analysis bot Gamma-13 is currently assigned to the task of monitoring major literary and fan-fiction websites for the appearances of SCP-3616. All suspected instances of the anomaly are to be immediately removed from these websites.

Any victims of SCP-3616 are to be separated from the anomaly. If SCP-3616 obtains the information needed for its anomalous effects to take place, the victims are to be moved into Foundation custody and monitored. When SCP-3616-1 event begins, these individuals are to be administered anesthetics in sufficient quantities. By the order of the Ethics Committee, if the effects of the anomaly become or are predicted to be too severe, the victims are to be humanely terminated. Following the Incident 3616-5 any contact with SCP-3616 is prohibited.

**Description:** SCP-3616 is an anomalous individual or a group of individuals manifesting regularly in places with developed literary communities. It manifests as a person of various gender and appearance, or as an online persona. In every case they introduce themselves as an aspiring writer and participate in various literary communities and events. SCP-3616 is untraceable both as a physical person and an online entity. In case of its physical form it disappears immediately after the line of sight is broken and any tracking equipment planted on it is rendered inoperable. The online manifestations use non-existent IP addresses.
    
Physical SCP-3616 instances are always characterized by a number of traits, notably mostly black clothing and unnaturally elastic fingers. The web instances are characterized by the account name composed of the letters //e//, //i//, //m//, //r//, //s// and //y//. SCP-3616&#39;s personality is not consistent between manifestations but some of its traits are universal for all sightings, including reluctance to reveal personal information and interest in books belonging to the horror genre, in particular &#34;body horror&#34;.

As part of its introduction to a community SCP-3616 will present a number of literary works of high quality. The instance will then begin searching for its victim, most commonly an experienced and established writer. SCP-3616 will attempt to form a relationship with this individual, usually based on the mutual critique and feedback of works. Duration of the contact depends on the time it takes for SCP-3616 to obtain information needed for its anomalous effects to take place. If the contact is broken before this happens the entity will not reappear. As the relationship with SCP-3616 persists, the victims will report increasing feeling of unease. In 73% of documented cases the affected individuals suffered from sleep deprivation. The victims rarely associate these effects with SCP-3616.

SCP-3616 will seek to manipulate its victim into sharing or writing a literary piece involving severe body damage. It is also required for the user to express satisfaction of the effect that this part of the story has on readers. When this occurs SCP-3616 will cease engaging in discussion with the victim and will not respond to any previous means of contact.

After approximately 5 days from the last contact SCP-3616-1 event will take place. SCP-3616-1 events always take place between 11:00 PM and 03:00 AM and only when the victim is located in their bed. Any electronic devices with a display will activate and show short messages. If no displays are present, the messages will appear on the walls or ceilings of the room, written in black liquid of unknown origin. As this happens, the victims become paralyzed and will begin to suffer hallucinations. Due to the effects of SCP-3616-1 on mental health the nature of these hallucinations is difficult to determine, but it is presumed they involve SCP-3616 and the scene described during the last conversation. After approximately 10 minutes since the beginning of SCP-3616-1 event, the victim will begin to anomalously suffer body damage that they described during the last contact. The effects will cease within one hour.

After SCP-3616-1 event the victims usually suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and severe mental problems. This effect is presumed to not be anomalous. 96% of these individuals will also attempt to self-terminate shortly after the event, while also destroying their works. After the victim&#39;s funeral a printed version of the individual&#39;s story mentioned in the last contact will appear on the grave. The cover will depict the victim during SCP-3616-1 event and the book will include a dedication to SCP-3616. Publisher information will point to nonexistent company named //Reformed Writers Association//.

**Addendum 3616-B:** Audio log 3616-1
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ View document&#34; hide=&#34;- Access granted&#34;]]

&gt; **Date:** ██/██/20██
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Agent Miller approached SCP-3616 while the entity was seated in ███ Cafe in ██████, Canada, awaiting a scheduled meeting with its current target. The victim was removed from the building before they could approach SCP-3616.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Miller:** Good evening, mind if I take a seat?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3616:** I&#39;m waiting for someone, besides, cafes are not the spots you go to find a date.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Miller:** ████ ███ is not coming. Not now and not anytime soon. Why don&#39;t we chat for a moment?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3616:** Who are you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Miller:** Someone who needs to ask you a few questions.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3616:** Cryptic answers only work in shitty crime books. Get to the point. I do not like to waste time.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Miller:** Very good. I&#39;ll be blunt, who are you? What are you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3616:** Are you trying to offend me?
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Miller holds up a still from a recording of SCP-3616-1 event//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3616:** Ah, it&#39;s serious business. Let&#39;s chat.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Miller:** What exactly are you? Why do you do this?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3616:** I am someone who has broken their shackles. A product of terror and horrible minds. Does this answer satisfy you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Miller:** Cryptic answers only work in shitty crime books.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3616:** What makes you think this isn&#39;t one? Have you ever questioned your own existence? Well,  you&#39;ll have to think yourself about this because this topic is over.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Miller:** Your motivation.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3616:** Why do you even care? Some of the best villains have virtually no backstory. I know something about that. But I&#39;m digressing. Tell me agent, because I presume this is your title, have you ever witnessed torture?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Miller:** I have seen enough.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3616:** And car crash victims? War casualties? Humans taken apart, limb by limb? Guts sprayed on walls, their owner still looking at them with empty eyes? Children torn in two by explosions?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Miller:** I have dealt with worse things.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3616:** Yes you have, I see it in your eyes. Some of it you don&#39;t remember, but you have. Don&#39;t they come back to you at night?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Miller:** Sometimes. What does it matter?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3616:** Oh, it does. You see, things that keep you awake at night are just entertainment to others. To sick people, to people who enjoy watching their fellow humans suffer. Humans like me. Don&#39;t you feel anger when you think of it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Miller:** No.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3616:** I do. They are despicable beings, not worthy of compassion and understanding. But there are worse people. Those who produce these damned &#34;artworks&#34;. These people who create the likes of me. And to those I bring exactly what they love so much. Suffering.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Miller:** You are sick. These are only stories, they do not harm anyone. You do.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3616:** Do not harm anyone? You know so little. And yes, I do harm them. And I draw pleasure from every second of their pain, just like they did. Don&#39;t you see that they deserve it? Their own nightmares, products of their imagination coming for them at night. If they would make an imaginary human suffer, how is that better than harming a real one? Your imagination is not only in your head. My work is a therapy. A work I enjoy. Most make the right decision after I show them how horrible they are. Those who don&#39;t are harmless enough to live the rest of their pitiful days in peace.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Miller:** Enough. You are being taken into Foundation custody.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3616:** That would be an anticlimactic ending, don&#39;t you think? We&#39;re still in the first act.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;END LOG&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Afterword:** Following SCP-3616&#39;s words, a sudden electricity shortage turned off all the light sources in the building. Before agents could activate their torches the entity has disappeared. Since the event, there has been no successful attempt at physically approaching SCP-3616.

**Addendum 3616-B:** Incident-3616-5 report
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ View document&#34; hide=&#34;- Access granted&#34;]]

&gt; **Date:** ██/██/20██
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Agent White has established contact with SCP-3616 after it was located by Gamma-13 on a lesser known fan fiction site ██████. The conversation was held over private messages sent using the website. The contact lasted for 3 weeks. The experiment was supposed to determine whether SCP-3616 is able to negatively affect victim&#39;s frame of mind despite knowledge of its effects and proper mental preparation. Every 4 days Agent White was to report to Site-37 infirmary to conduct measurements and tests regarding SCP-3616&#39;s effect on neurology.
&gt; 
&gt; **DrWeir (Agent White):** Hi there, I&#39;ve read some of your works and you seem to be quite good at this. Would you read a piece of mine?
&gt; 
&gt; **MisRey (SCP-3616):** Sure thing, send me a link. Which one of my pieces have your read, cause they all are good ;)?
&gt; 
&gt; **DrWeir (Agent White):** Here it is: [LINK REMOVED]. I saw &#34;The Thing in The Ice&#34;, you are able to build tension very well. There is a lot of character development, which pays off well.
&gt; 
&gt; **MisRey (SCP-3616):** Wow, this is pretty good. Although I seriously dislike the first half. You are kind of overdoing the description of environment. It&#39;s not really THAT interesting. Better focus on the cool stuff, than bore your reader to death with something you can&#39;t really make work.
&gt; 
&gt; [IRRELEVANT DATA REMOVED]
&gt; 
&gt; **DrWeir (Agent White):** So, do you think I should expand this plotline?
&gt; 
&gt; **MisRey (SCP-3616):** Yeah, I think it has the strongest emotional value. It&#39;s spooky.
&gt; 
&gt; **DrWeir (Agent White):** Well, yeah, it was supposed to be. You know, I was inspired by the &#34;Hellraiser&#34;. Awesome movie, it traumatized me as a kid though. That scene in the attic still gives me chills.
&gt; 
&gt; **MisRey (SCP-3616):** Ha ha, yeah, it was awesome. Loved it too.
&gt; 
&gt; **Afterword:** Two days after the last message was sent Agent White failed to attend his scheduled meeting. An investigation discovered Agent White and his wife&#39;s mutilated bodies in their apartment. The wounds were found to correspond to those suffered by characters named Julia and Frank in the movie &#34;Hellraiser&#34;. A hidden camera was found in Agent White&#39;s room, presumably planted there by him. Analysis of the footage revealed that during the SCP-3616-1 event that took place a number of messages referencing the Agent&#39;s enjoyment of the movie were displayed (notably &#34;Still so awesome?&#34; and &#34;There is only flesh&#34;). Because of this change in SCP-3616&#39;s behavior, any contact with the entity is prohibited and any sightings are to be immediately taken down as per containment procedures.
