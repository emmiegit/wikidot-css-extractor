|caption=[[size 90%]]A SCP-6533-1 instance in [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-hole-in-mars New Houston], USA, Mars.[[/size]]]]

[[span class=&#34;h-span&#34;]]Special Containment Procedures:[[/span]] The SCP-6533 research team is developing a method of halting the manifestation of the anomaly and overall prevent the ongoing PHK-Class Multiplanetary-Attack Scenario.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]See Addendum 3 for more information.[[/span]]

Until a proper solution is found, Mobile Task Force-Rho-84 (&#34;Duck Hunt&#34;) must respond to reports of SCP-6533 phenomena from civilians by removing current passengers and containing the affected vehicle, or, if its transformation completes, neutralize the SCP-6533-1 instance by use of explosive projectiles. Live captured instances are contained in high-security containment chambers at TRITON-Site-934, while the remains of neutralized instances are recycled.

------

[[span class=&#34;h-span&#34;]]Description:[[/span]] SCP-6533 is an unpredictable event exclusively affecting human spacecraft, with no known concrete cause or pattern. Affected vehicles will begin to travel autonomously, disregarding any orders by its operator(s), for approximately 5 hours. After this period, the ship will begin to bend, tear and crush itself for 30 minutes until it is reshaped into a body resembling the extinct //Aves// class of animals[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Commonly known as the bird. Formerly a highly-populant type of vertebrate before the ED-K Class &#34;Lethe&#34; Event on Earth caused irredeemable damage to the biosphere due to the collapse of human civilization, eventually terminating a majority of avian species. Remaining birds died off from incompatibility with extraterrestrial environments and other natural causes.[[/span]] from the planet Earth (designated SCP-6533-1).

Fully formed SCP-6533-1 instances are sentient and will attempt to search for and destroy any human infrastructure, either terrestrial or interstellar, by hitting buildings with their &#34;wings&#34;, pecking structures or rapidly expelling fuel into population centers. These attacks will continue indefinitely unless the entities are dismantled.

SCP-6533-1 specimens are proven to not be mechanically operated automatons, as all machinery is destroyed after an instance forms itself. --Current research has yet to uncover the animate nature of SCP-6533-1 entities.--[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]] Outdated data removed: See Addendum 3 for updated information.[[/span]]


[[span class=&#34;h-span&#34;]]History:[[/span]] First sighting of the SCP-6533 phenomenon occured in 14/05/2104, when a commercial spacecraft preparing for takeoff from the Gimhea International Spaceport in New Busan, Luna Korea was affected by the anomaly. Subsequent manifestations occured in Mars, Venus, Jupiter&#39;s moons and various interstellar structures, respectively. 

Initial manifestations would be reported for every 3 months, but would later become much more frequent over time, resulting in SCP-6533 transpiring every 2-3 weeks as of the current date.

SCP-6533 has been public knowlegde since the day of its inception, as efforts to conceal the phenomenon were deemed to be impractical to their safety. Civilian response to the anomaly has been very agressive, with a majority of the human population attempting to incapacitate the entities, despite warnings by the Foundation to handle SCP-6533 containment to trained staff only. These attacks by the public are theorized to have increased the frequency and severity of SCP-XXXX events in the Solar System.

------
[[span class=&#34;h-span&#34;]]Addendum 1 - Incidents:[[/span]] The following is a list of three example SCP-6533 manifestations in the Solar System. For a full comprehensive list, see Document-6533-1-FL in the Site-934 digital archive.

||~ Date ||~ Location ||
||= 14/05/2104 ||= Gimhea International Spaceport, New Busan, Luna Korea, Earth&#39;s Moon||
||||~ Details ||
||||The Boeing S878 commercial spaceship of Flight 410 (New Busan -- Kyung) suddenly began activity without command by its pilots, taking off much earlier than scheduled. Passengers and staff inside were panicking as the ship seemingly flew in random directions above New Busan. As no evidence of a cyberattack on the ship&#39;s sytems was detected by Korean law enforcement, the event was suspected to be paranatural and thaumaturgists from the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/groups-of-interest-ko#NPES National Paranormal Emergency Service (NPES)] were deployed to handle the situation. _
 _
While the passengers were succesfully apported[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]] **Apportation** — An occult method of instantaneous teleportation.[[/span]] to the spaceport and the ship magically restrained, the vehicle began to reshape itself into an animated sculpture of a //Columba livia domestica// (Feral Pigeon) instance, breaching out of the thaumaturgical lock. The instance proceeded to run throughout New Busan, congesting traffic and damaging buildings by flapping its &#34;wings&#34;, blowing objects away. NPES members successfully terminated the entity 30 minutes later, transferring the leftover scraps into an unknown location. NPES has refused to give any further information gained on the entity, nor the location of its remains, to the Foundation.||

|||| The //Twilight Sky// luxury cruise spaceship, which was in the process of a 5-day cruise from Palmira to Concordia with 4,626 passengers and 1,473 crew members on board, started to display signs of being under an SCP-6533 event as it began controlling itself without prompt. Aware of the phenomena, //Twilight Sky// staff members quickly directed passagers towards the emergency Artificial Way leading back to the Palmira Port before the ship would alter itself.  Despite their efforts, 156 passengers failed to exit the vehicle and presumably died by crushing as the ship reshaped itself into a form resembling a //Falco rusticolus// (gyrfalcon). _
 _
The SCP-6533-1 instance began flying towards Concordia with exceptional speed, forcing Foundation assets in the planet to order a missile strike upon the entity. The SCP-6533-1 specimen was successfully hit and fell down into a lava field on the surface of Venus. Despite this, it remains active, attempting to launch itself off from the molten rock.||

||||~ Details ||
|||| An automatic mining unit began to drill onto infrastructures and nearby manned ships. Initially assumed to be a glitch in the unit&#39;s system, mining operations were cancelled after the unit reshaped itself into a //Campephilus principalis// (ivory-billed woodpecker) form, using the drill as a &#34;beak&#34;. _
 _
While the mining company responsible for the operation advised everyone to leave the vicinity, their miners instead attemped to destroy the entity themselves by using drilling equipment and explosives. The SCP-6533-1 specimen suffered enough damage to become inanimate, which resulted in a celebration between mining staff. The remains of the unit were melted for recycling.  ||

[[span class=&#34;h-span&#34;]]Addendum 2 - Interview:[[/span]] On 19/02/2105, a Foundation armed spacecraft stationed at Triton had suffered an SCP-6533 event. After complete transformation, Mobile Task Force members claimed the entity (designated SCP-6533-1-442) was able to produce semi-coherent speech, using the voice synthesis of BT-020.aic, which was installed in the ship system at the time of the SCP-6533 event. As all surveillance footage of the incident was lost due to the destruction caused by the instance, their claims could not be verified at the time. The entity did not speak when containment was achieved. An interview was made to confirm the existence of this ability.

**Date:** 23/05/2104 02:53 (TRTC)

**Location:** TRITON-Site-934

**Interviewer:** Dr. Collen Minerva

**Interviewee:** SCP-6533-1-442

**Supervisor(s):** Dr. Sapphira Eponine, Head Researcher.

**Foreword:** Dr. Minerva will be conversing with SCP-6533-1-442 through a speaker embedded in its chamber, while watching the entity through a surveillance camera.

------
= **[BEGIN TRANSCRIPT]**
------
= [SCP-6533-1-442 is seen at its chamber, pecking the wall to its left.]

**Dr. Sapphira Eponine:** The set is activated. You may begin the interview, Collen.

**Dr. Collen Minerva:** Alright, here we go. This is interview six-five-three-three &#39;one&#39;. [Collen adjusts the microphone.] //Ahem//. Hello? Can you understand me?

= [4 seconds of silence. The entity inspects the walls of the chamber.]

**Collen:** If you can understand me, please say something.

= [18 seconds of silence follows as both doctors wait for any response.]

**SCP-6533-1-442:** //RAAAWWK!!//

**Collen:** Woah! What was that?!

**Sapphira:** ...Not what I expected. Turn the volume down.

**SCP-6533-1-442:** //RAAAAAWWK!!// [Chirping of an unidentified species of //Psittacoidea// (True Parrot).] 

= [**Omitted:** For the next 5 minutes, Dr. Collen attempts to get SCP-6533-1-442 to vocalize any intelligeble language, while the entity in question proceeds producing various parrot calls.]

**Collen:** We&#39;re not getting anything, Doctor. Are they sure it said something while it was out?

**Sapphira:** The MTFs were insistent that it was saying something with an &#39;R&#39;. [Sigh] I guess we know what that is now.

**Collen:** Ugh, what a waste of a time.

**Sapphira:** Yeah, this interview is finished.

= [Dr. Eustache begins to deactive the recording equipment.]

**Collen:** I&#39;m gonna go to the canteen later, I would kill for some pizz--

**SCP-6533-1-442:** //KILL!//

**Collen:** Um...

= [Dr. Collen grabs the microphone.]

**Collen:** Can you... repeat that?

**1-442:** //KILL. ...THEY KILLED THEM.//

**Collen:** What are you referring to?

**1-442:** //OUR BROTHERS. OUR HOME. BROKEN BY THEM. RAAWK! KILLED BY THEM.//

**Collen:** ...Who?

**1-442:** //MAN.// [Spastic Chirping] //MAN KILLED US.//

**Collen:** [Silence.] I don&#39;t understand.

**Afterword:** After this interview, Dr. Sapphira Eponine assigned members of The Department of Spectral Phenomena to further research the anomaly, citing the implications from the entity.

[[/div]]

------

[[span class=&#34;h-span&#34;]]Addendum 3 - Spectremetry:[[/span]] An inspection and study by the Department of Spectral Phenomena has revealed minute traces of ectoplasm on certain components of vehicles affected by SCP-6533, confirming the presence of an ectomorphic spectral entity inside activate SCP-6533-1 instances.

This newly discovered aspect of these entites, along with their increasing rate of manifestations, would imply that SCP-6533 itself constitutes a PHK-Class &#34;Specter Storm&#34; Multiplanetary-Attack Scenario.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]A scenario where the complete collective of humanity is targeted by a group of aggressive spectral entities that have suffered an extinction, were the victim of a genocide or were generally killed in its entirety.[[/span]] Foundation analysts conclude that this event may progress for a further 300,000 years until the entire population of deceased birds is depleted, and will result in an overwhelming amount of damage to human construction in total.

As current containment methods will not be sufficient to diminish SCP-6533&#39;s effects on human civilization, Dr. Sapphira has proposed that SCP-6533 be decommissioned, with complete approval of the [[[decom-dept-hub|Decommissioning Department.]]] Containment procedures have been edited to focus on research into a possible system-wide exorcism.

------

[[span class=&#34;h-span&#34;]]Addendum 4 - Decommissioning Attempt:[[/span]] After a duration of 4 months and 17 days, the decommisioning method of the SCP-6533 phenomena was prepared for activation.

The attempt would consist of several exorcism rituals performed on various points in the Solar System, each one operated in a different planet in reversal order of initial SCP-6533-1 manifestations, with the final ritual performed on Earth.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]A minor breach of [[[scp-4887|Class-H Quarantine Zone]]] protocols will be allowed due to the severity of the situation, however personnel are required wear a hazardous materials suit when entering the planet, and must still be screened when exiting.[[/span]]

74 occult personnel located across the system will participate in the operation, while the main SCP-6533 research team, lead by Dr. Sapphira, will be responsible for the final ritual on Earth.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]] The former Site-01-ARC has been selected as the proper site for the ritual, due to its functioning Scranton Reality Anchors (SRA) diminishing any possible anomalous phenomenon in the area.[[/span]] Various items required for the procedure are mostly common ingredients for standard spiritual exorcism, however due to the nature of the targeted spectral entity, most items will consist of plants and other botanical objects originating from Earth.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]For full list of items used, see Document-6533-DEC/IT.[[/span]]

The scheduled date for the decommissioning attempt is currently being considered by the SCP-6533 research team, the Decommissioning Department and the Overseer Council.

++ **DECOMMISSIONING LOG**
+++ **6533.01**

[[&lt;]]
------

**Date:** 18/02/2106

**Location:** Site-2460, Rhea (Saturn satellite); Site-729, Ganymede (Jupiter satellite); Site-1045, Venus; Site-692, Mars; Site-01-ARC, Greenland, Earth.

**Subject:** SCP-6533

**Personnel present:** Dr. Sapphira Eponine, [73 personnel omitted]

------
= **[BEGIN LOG]**
------

**«00:26:43»** - After Dr. Sapphira contacts every commanding occultist, who are responsible for each individual ritual in a planet/moon, for confirmation of their preparation by use of TCG[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]**Thaumic Communication Gateways** — Artificially created Ways that act as a means of interstellar communication, bypassing the speed of light.[[/span]] radio, she officially declares the initiation of the decommissioning attempt. All ritual participants take position, and Sapphira orders the first ritual in Rhea.

= [**Omitted:** All rituals except Earth’s are successfully performed without complications.]

**«02:45:08»** - The final ritual commences. Dr. Sapphira signals all other nearby thaumaturges to begin singing their incantations. Eustache goes to the center and takes out a bag of //Helianthus annuus// (Common sunflower) seeds.

**«02:48:20»** - As Sapphira proceeds to take one of the seeds, loud sounds of metal tearing gradually become audible on the surrounding area. The researcher orders a pause to the ritual when she notices.

**«02:50:00»** - A large shadow emerges on the current location. Seen above the sky is a massive group of SCP-6533-1 entities approaching the site of the operation. Nearby members of MTF-Rho-84 begin preparing plasma artillery equipment while ritual participants continue the ritual, although in a nervous manner, per command of Sapphira.

**«02:53:34»** - After three minutes of consecutive shooting at the cloud of entities, the artillery runs out of power. Before they could recharge, the SCP-6533-1 instances reach to the perimeter of the operation and begin attacking security personnel. Dr. Sapphira orders all thaumaturges to escape to the emergency bunker before the surrounding instances reach the ritual area.

**«02:54:11»** - The head researcher guides all personnel to the bunker as the entities incapacitate almost all Task Force members. After all occultists have entered the bunker, Dr. Sapphira begins to grab the ritual materials and sprints to the bunker.

**«02:55:52»** - Before she reaches the bunker&#39;s door, a SCP-6533-1 instance blocks her path and forces her to stop. It emits a high-volume shriek at her by use of a malfuntioning voice synthesizer, causing her to fall down and drop all the items except one. The entity begins approaching the researcher while humming agreessive tones. Sapphira closes her eyes.

**«02:56:28»** - The SCP-6533-1 instance abruptly stops walking and stares.

**«02:57:13»** - Sapphira opens her eyes in confusion. The instance continues staring. At this point, all other instances in the area halt their attacks and stare at the researcher.

**«02:57:36»** - Sapphira looks around in further confusion. When she slowly stands up, the instance&#39;s head tilts slightly. She notices that the instance is not staring at her directly, but at the bag of seeds. Moving of the bag confirms this.

**«02:57:50»** - The researcher opens the bag and throws four seeds in front of the entity. It begins to &#34;eat&#34; them, grabbing the seeds with its beak-shaped portion of its body and intaking them. The seeds fall out of its body through some holes on its underbelly, however the entity appears to be satisfied regardless. It brushes its head to Dr. Sapphira, and she awkwardly &#34;pets&#34; the entity in return.

**«02:59:14»** - After this period, the entity distances itself from the researcher, and it collapses into a pile of metal scrap. A different SCP-6533-1 entity approaches Dr. Sapphira and stares at the bag of seeds.

= [**Omitted:** Dr. Sapphira and the rest of the personnel present bring available seeds to the non-hostile SCP-6533-1 instances and interacts with them, until all entities became inactive.]
------
= **[END LOG]**
------

**Result:** **##red|FAILURE##**

**Afterword:** Post-analysis of the decommissioning attempt revealed that the final ritual seems to attract overwhelming attention from SCP-6533-1 instances due to its placement on Earth, making proper execution of the exorcism impossible without extreme defensive measures. Additionally, Site-01-ARC&#39;s Scranton Reality Anchors did not mitigate the entities due to their deterioated state, especially the decomposed operators, which personnel had overlooked.

Fortunately, Dr. Sapphira Eponine has created alternate containment procedures based off research on the failed attempt, theorizes to be able to neutralize the anomaly in a slowly but effective and cheap method. The proposed procedure is filed below:

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
[[span class=&#34;h-span&#34;]]Suggested Containment Procedures:[[/span]] Mobile Task Force Rho-85 (&#34;Duck Fun! :D&#34;) will respond to reports of SCP-6533 phenomena from civilians by removing current passengers and containing the affected vehicle. When it is transformed, MTF-Rho-85 must commandeer seeds[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]] Specifically either thistle, shelled corn, peanut, safflower or sunflower seeds.[[/span]]  to the SCP-6533-1 instance until it is pacified, and interact with the anomaly playfully until it is neutralized. Most effective spots for petting include the entity’s chin, cranium and back. Large construction machinery can be used as a substitute for hands, in case of encountering larger instances.

The remains of neutralized instances are to be recycled.

[[/div]]

These procedures have been approved for execution by the Containment Committee. Approval by the Overseer Council is pending.
