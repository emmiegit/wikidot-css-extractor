**Special Containment Procedures:** Suspected cases of SCP-6049 are to be monitored to prevent outbreaks. In the event that an SCP-6049 outbreak occurs in a populated area, MTF-Chi-7 ‘Plague Tamers’ is to be deployed in order to quarantine the affected area. All affected individuals should be treated with antiviral medication and placed under observation. When the area has been cleared, affected individuals are to be administered Class-C amnestics and released. Misinformation about a &#34;highly contagious pathogen outbreak&#34; should be disseminated. A sample of SCP-6049 is to be stored in Biological Research Area-12. Controlled exposure to SCP-6049 is allowed with authorization from a researcher with level 3 clearance.

**Description:** SCP-6049 is a highly contagious strand of the Influenza A Virus. SCP-6049 displays an elevated infection rate in non-human hosts, although it displays no anomalous characteristics otherwise. The virus follows a similar incubation period to that of its non-anomalous counterpart, with symptoms starting to affect the subject 1-2 days after initial exposure. Once the infection has progressed past the incubation stage, SCP-6049’s anomalous properties become apparent.

SCP-6049 infections target the occipital lobe of the brain, which processes visual input. SCP-6049 is able to cause mild but constant hallucinations that manifest as advertisements on the subject’s field of vision. So far, no instances have matched a real product, which has led to the conclusion that SCP-6049 is unable to transmit information, approximating what is viewed as an advertisement rather than a detailed picture. This has also led to the consensus that SCP-6049 is not sentient, since it lacks the intelligence to accurately replicate or generate a clear image.

SCP-6049 can be treated with conventional antivirals, and it is considered low-risk due to the absence of common symptoms associated with its non-anomalous counterpart. However, untreated exposure to SCP-6049 over the course of several weeks deteriorates the brain and increases the intensity of these hallucinations, culminating in death at around three weeks after initial exposure due to overstimulation. Due to the very noticeable nature of the hallucinations produced by SCP-6049, a subsection of MTF Chi-7 has been assigned to quickly treat SCP-6049 outbreaks.

SCP-6049 in its original form is believed to have been engineered by known parapharmacologist and Person of Interest “dado” as part of an agreement with Group of Interest “Marshall, Carter, &amp; Dark”. For more information on this partnership, refer to Addendum-6049-A. A second strain, designated SCP-6049-1, was developed and manufactured by MC&amp;D using the base sequence found in the original version of SCP-6049. This strain is capable of producing clear, distinct images, and has a much shorter incubation period than the original. The production of this strain was completed and a demonstration was conducted in New York City, NY on ██/█/████, leading to a widespread outbreak of SCP-6049-1, known as Incident-6049-N. Foundation agents were deployed and although the outbreak was successfully contained, due to unforeseen circumstances, widespread amnestization efforts were needed to reestablish normalcy. All casualties were given appropriate cover stories, and the scene was successfully contained. Deemed a security risk after Incident-6049-N, Foundation agents embedded in MC&amp;D conducted a full-scale retrieval operation on ██/█/████, resulting in the neutralization of SCP-6049-1 and its variants. For documents retrieved during the raid, refer to Addendum-6049-B. For information concerning Incident-6049-N, consult Incident-6049-N.

The item we are looking for must follow the following specifications:
 The item must be a virus capable of airborne transmission.
The item must be able to make the affected individual see images.
These images must be modifiable in order to suit customer needs.
If this project looks feasible, we are willing to extend you a formal offer to develop the item for us. I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir,
I am writing to follow up on my colleague’s interaction with you. We have come to an agreement regarding thereof your services in the development of this item. Marshall, Carter, &amp; Dark is prepared to pay you the sum of 500 Million USD for the development of this item. Our intention is to sell an item that fits the description that was given to you as a sort of inoculation, not as a virus by itself. Surely a renowned pharmacologist such as yourself would understand the uses for a virus strictly as medicine. We are interested in 10 containers of the virus, with payment deposited as soon as the item is received. We appreciate your cooperation.

Respectfully yours,

Karina Kane
Sales Director
Marshall, Carter, and Dark LLP

hello this is dado pursuer of fine dado goods like dado carpet cleaners and music productions. 
dado has consulted many very good medicine conferences and dado now sees how virus can be medicine because medicine can also make you sick so you are not sick after virus idk the conferences keep talking about the same virus which make dado think that market is new before all doctor makes new virus to make people sick and immune. dado send product today and the product will be arriving at noon because amazon prime order is received by drones made by good capitalist amazon warehouse. 
dado decided to implant new revolutionary dado chip technology on virus to make images appear by themselves without user interface because dado is very good at medicine and also is thinking of fine business partner mcd and the sick client.
 dado has also included very small advertisement for fine dado business at the bottom of all virus so client can look at all of the fine dado business that is happening and word of mouth gets around to fine businessmen that give dado money for good ideas.
 also dado is sending only 9 canisters of fine dado product because a canister fell over when i was packing fine product inside amazon prime box but is no worries because virus will cure people in the street also thank you send money when the product is being delivered bye.

**Incident-6049-N: AFTER ACTION REPORT**

//The following is the after-action report filed by Agent Molina, commander of MTF Chi-7.//

[[div class=“blockquote&#34;]]
    On ██/█/████, following the interception of MC&amp;D memos detailing a widespread test of SCP-6049-1 on a populated area, Mobile Task Force Chi-Seven (Plague Tamers) was dispatched in order to prevent the release of SCP-6049-1. The core Chi-7 unit was supplemented with a secondary subunit specialized in disabling biological weapons, and agents specialized in setting up quarantine zones effectively and discreetly.

    The test site was found using information available through Foundation informants, who relayed the coordinates of a circular area in New York City, NY. The area raised concerns due to the site’s proximity to the known extra-dimensional settlement classified “Backdoor SoHo”. The proximity to an area known for its affluence of anomalous entities brought a need for additional caution, due to the general distrust displayed by the anomalous community towards the Foundation. Prior to arrival, preparations were made in order to have additional equipment ready to be deployed in case of a breach. On arrival, a preemptive ‘quarantine zone&#39; was established around the area’s perimeter.

    While the equipment necessary to detect biological hazards was being set up, unwanted attention from civilians increased to the point where misinformation was necessary. In order to keep people from leaving the area prior to the biological hazard’s neutralization, an appropriate cover story involving air quality testing was given. This seemed to calm down most civilians, which gave the team enough time to localize and deactivate 5 SCP-6049-1 canisters.

    Unfortunately, due to the limited information Foundation agents were able to extract, the team failed to locate 4 canisters hidden in the city’s sewage system, and all 4 containers successfully released a significant amount of SCP-6049-1, resulting in ███ cases among civilians and 2 cases among Foundation agents, Agent Walters and Agent Wood, who had taken off their protective equipment prematurely.

    The symptoms started to become noticeable minutes after initial exposure, which helped mobilize all of Chi-7 quickly and maintain the quarantine zone that had already been established. Affected individuals, anomalous or not, started presenting symptoms much faster than previously anticipated, a previously unknown side effect of SCP-6049-1. The effect was much faster and highly aggressive in individuals possessing thaumaturgic abilities, with an estimated ██ deaths occurring before additional medical supplies had arrived.

    As resources and personnel arrived, a safer location was established in order to efficiently deal with the treatment of all affected individuals. All individuals successfully treated were amnesticized after a 24 hour observation period. The preparation of additional supplies is estimated to have helped cut down on deaths by 25%.

    Due to the magnitude of this event, along with the loss of 2 members of MTF Chi-7, it is strongly suggested that a mission to neutralize SCP-6049-1 take priority. The potential for this virus to spread throughout a populated city is enough to warrant this suggestion, but the main concern is its instability. In the space of a few hours, there were an estimated ███ deaths that occurred too quickly to prevent, including Agent Walters, who received treatment too late for the effects to dissipate. It is of utmost importance that SCP-6049-1 be neutralized before it has a chance to enter the market, due to the pervasive threat of a larger deliberate outbreak.
