+ **OPERATION LAHMI-GATH**
[[/=]]
----------
**Date Authorized:** 23/07/1964

**Updated on:** 31/10/2014

**Operation objective:** Lahmi-Gath designates the Foundation contingency for the collapse of the American Federal Government. 

The Operation will explore Foundation short, medium and long term objectives to ensure continued operation and preserve normalcy during an extended insurgency in the former United States.

**Assumptions:**
# The American Federal Government has lost the ability to administrate &gt;80% of the United States, including both rural and urban areas. Federal Authority will be concentrated to a centralized urban territory, likely on the East Coast.
# Insurgency will be decentralized, include all sections of American society and rely on irregular warfare. Insurgent leaders will follow the pattern of other 21st century insurrections, forming many minor factions each with separate diplomatic ties and objectives.
# Foreign interference in the civil unrest will be kept to humanitarian support and largely irrelevant minor military aid.
# The Federal Government has very little popular support, both inside and outside territory still controlled by it. Major defections in both mundane and anomalous departments are to be expected.

[[size 200%]]**Immediate Security Concerns**[[/size]]
[[/=]]
[[div style=&#34;text-indent:5%;&#34;]]

-------
Since the Foundation&#39;s inception, American sites have required minimal external security. Outwardly presenting as a military base or other government building has dissuaded all above the veil attacks on Foundation property, allowing all low value and Safe-Euclid sites to operate with minimal site security. Even high-value sites are generally only prepared for one major attack before respite, as would be expected by Hostile GoIs. With the collapse of Federal authority, an entrenched identity as a military base will instead invite frequent attack, which will pose unprecedented issues for continued containment efforts across the entire United States.

As of 31/10/2014, mass amnestization or anomalous means of preventing assaults on Foundation sites is unfeasible, and the use of anomalous weaponry to protect sites will be inadvisable. For this reason, efforts should prioritize reducing Foundation presence in the United States when possible, and preparing American sites for a prolonged siege event. [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#nu-7 MTF Nu-7 (Hammer Down)] will likely be the Foundation&#39;s most effective tool to protect major American sites, but does not currently have the capacity to cover every site against prolonged assault.

This suggests the current Foundation presence in the United States of America will not be practical in the event of civil war. This paper recommends a mass evacuation of Safe and all other available objects from the United States. This will no doubt present several logistical challenges on a scale the Foundation has not yet had to deal with. Security risks involving object transport are considered an acceptable consequence of Operation Lahmi-Gath. Objects are to be transported to other North American sites as space allows, with the construction of other Safe low-security sites as necessary to store Anomalous Items and Safe class anomalies.

**Ash:** Hell no. You are __not__ picking up the entire American branch of the Foundation and taking it on a road trip to Canada. Even 43 couldn&#39;t take on a fraction of what this is asking, and running any site overcapacity is a recipe for disaster. If this isn&#39;t changed, people will die.

A significant source of Unrest during the Civil Uprising phase of the American Civil War. Largely absorbed into other factions or local militias as of February.[[/span]], clearly not related to any military unit or they&#39;d known to give us a wide berth. Thankfully, we&#39;re light on humanoids and the structural damage is relatively minor, but 73 nearly got overrun by Texan Neoconfeds a few days back and 17&#39;s currently under siege. If //any// site falls, a lifted veil scenario is the best-case scenario. An army way out of their depth wandering about a Foundation site, letting god knows what loose is a terrifying thought.

**Jones:** The Terror-Industrial Complex - named after Da&#39;esh strategy in the Syrian Civil War. With the rise of the internet, the spread of improvised weaponry is near-universal, and constantly being improved by use. Open source instruments of destruction. We&#39;re talking mortars easy enough to build that your average American mechanic could put one together. Shells that can be made from any factory that produces something remotely cylindrical. A modular detonator that&#39;s used in mortar shells, grenades, improvised rockets, car bombs and the IED that dropped like a message from God upon four personnel and their tank this morning. All you need are Materials.

**Jones:** Materials, by the way, that America has in excess. A rural Midwestern farmer likely has metric tons of the same explosive precursors that Da&#39;esh used to carve a ruthless empire through the middle east. All of which can be weaponised at a thousandth of the cost of what the Foundation would have to pay to repair or replace the damage the improvised weapon can do.

**Ash:** Alright, staying in America isn&#39;t an option then, but that doesn&#39;t change that Canada still can&#39;t take all this in without our infrastructure crumbling under the load. Can we throw some of the more problematic objects at the European sites? It&#39;s a few extra hours of travel over the Atlantic and would do wonders for containment security. They can stay temporarily in Canada for pick-up if that would make things easier.

[[size 200%]]**Supplying the Foundation in a Warzone**[[/size]]
[[/=]]
[[div style=&#34;text-indent:5%;&#34;]]
------------------
The Foundation&#39;s expenditures in the United States of America are comparable to that of an entire nation. An average of 80% of this is spent on object containment. With the collapse of traditional production and import routes, continued containment will become increasingly difficult. The Foundation consumes huge amounts of capital and materials in the protection of consensus reality, often requiring incredibly specialized or rare resources that have only become available in the globalized 20th-century world. Alternative methods of acquiring these will be discussed below in order of difficulty.

The United States are the largest government contributor to the Foundation&#39;s budget but will likely be unable and unwilling to continue providing to Foundation efforts in the event of severe civil unrest. In addition to this, America&#39;s collapse will lead to a recession, rendering Foundation investments unlikely to make up the difference if required. While long term this provides an opportunity for increased Foundation investment, it leaves very little option for a short term injection. Instead, immediate fundraising efforts could include liquidation of Foundation front organizations or expanded contributions from other nation-states.

Even with sufficient funding, supplying sites brings with it several complications.
Firstly, there will always be an inherent risk of transporting materials through a war zone, by air or by land. These losses will have to be considered acceptable, but minimized when possible by concealing low-value transport as civilian, and escorts for high value. More importantly, concealed sites deep in insurgents land will not be able to be supplied on a regular basis. Frequent shipments will draw unnecessary attention to Foundation sites, which poses an unacceptable risk to normalcy as mentioned in the first section of Operation Lahmi-Gath. For this reason, all sites should be supplied with several months of supplies, those necessary for containment and food/water to sustain staff for the same period of time. This should allow site self-sufficiency regardless of the conditions around it for everything except electricity.

A power-cut at nearly any site would almost certainly cause a major containment breach. Currently, policy calls for a standardized 6 hours worth of onsite power storage in the form of a battery buffer, but this will be inadequate should American national infrastructure collapse. The Libyan civil war teaches us to expect frequent, long-lasting power cuts, exasperated by the fact that many facilities will be working without the express permission of those with authority over the land they are on, meaning a connection to mains electricity may not be possible at all. Each remaining Foundation site must be self-sufficient in regards to power, for a long enough period that ensures they can run until resupply without risk of a blackout.

**Russel:** Foundation-Chinese relations are better now than they were back in 2014, and the Chinese economy&#39;s faring better than most the world&#39;s who&#39;s still recovering from 2020 or reeling from America’s collapse right now. I&#39;m sure we can convince them to cough up some cash to keep the lights on. India might be more tricky but Japan should be willing and able to step up to the plate too.

**Jordan:** In 2020, the United States of America had two independent organizations for the anomalous world. These have been used to [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4776| attack Foundation sites]]], [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3874| advance American foreign policy]]] and, since November, upon their own citizens in the name of keeping the peace. It is not a comforting thought, but the Foundation never had a monopoly on containment under America&#39;s wings. To imply that the same situation of mutual cooperation with India or China is any worse is blatant Orientalism.

**Morrison:** Do I really need to explain the difference between pre-junta America and the Communist Party of China to a member of the fucking //Ethics Committee//? We can&#39;t rely on authoritarian governments to prop the Foundation up and expect to remain objective, and I refuse to support giving up one of the Foundation&#39;s founding principles for some short term cash we can find elsewhere.

The Foundation requires a consistent supply of personnel, both specialized and D-class. While Researcher and Agent recruitment efforts in Europe can be expanded to make up for the human capital flight[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]] Colloquially referred to as &#39;Brain Drain&#39;[[/span]] America will experience, D-class recruitment will pose a major issue for continued operation. The United States has the largest criminal population in the world and makes up a supermajority of D-class personnel - other nations with a sufficient population eligible for D-Class recruitment are not ideal due to a lack of English comprehension in prisoner population and logistical concerns. 

If alternative English speaking countries cannot supply Foundation requirements due to quantitative or logistical concerns, [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/security-clearance-levels#toc11 |Protocol 12]]][[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]] //In times of duress, Protocol 12 may be enacted, which allows recruitment from other sources — such as political prisoners, refugee populations, and other civilian sources — that can be transferred into Foundation custody under plausibly deniable circumstances.// _
-Security Clearance Dossier, Level 4.[[/span]] should be invoked, expanding the criteria for the recruitment of D-Class personnel as necessary. The Federal Government remnants will be the only group the Foundation can continue to acquire D-class personnel through in North America without significant risk of information breach. There will likely be an incarcerated population larger than pre-civil war conditions that are eligible for D-Class status under Protocol 12, which will serve as a pragmatic source for D-Class personnel employment.

**Jordan:** The Foundation needs bodies, and there&#39;s nothing we can do about that. With that being said, the Ethics Committee has access to Protocol 12 and I cannot in good faith recommend authorizing it short of a worldwide emergency. Introduction of a translator on all Foundation sites seems like an acceptable alternative solution. The technology has advanced rapidly since this paper was last updated.

**Jones:** Translators can be accurate to the word and meaning or they can be real-time - we need both, and the technology is just not there yet. One miscommunication and entire sites could fall. Sourcing D-Class from America makes the most sense right now.

**Morrison:** Why is this even a question? We take political prisoners from America or what? We take political prisoners from Russia and China nine times out of ten. And it&#39;s one less thing they can hold over our heads since you lot seem set on selling out. The American&#39;s will thank us for taking people off their hands and we need all the goodwill we can get right now.

**Ash:** We aren&#39;t sending Americans convicted of having the wrong opinions to death! And we definitely aren&#39;t doing it to win fucking brownie points with a collapsing government. America&#39;s time in the sun is over, and you need to accept that, Phoenix. Stop clinging to a Democracy that died when Esper stepped in two months ago.

Largely considered to be the end of the Civil Uprising Phase of the American Civil War and the beginning of Early Insurgency.[[/span]] but the Federal Government is still by far the most organized and well-equipped faction in America. Get on their good side and we&#39;ve got a whole host less problems, and they&#39;ll owe us one hell of a favour once the situation is back under control.

I&#39;m not horribly against invoking Protocol 12, but really Phoenix, remember that you are here to represent the interests of the Foundation&#39;s sites first and leave your American sympathies at the door.
