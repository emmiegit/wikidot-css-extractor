[[tab Archer]]

&gt; //Servant Archer, Major Alexei Belitrov of the [[[war-is-child-s-play|Red Army 22nd Armoured Infantry Division]]]. Master, from my understanding, you are a participant of the Holy Grail War. I also understand that my objective is the termination of the other six enemy Servants or their Masters, whichever is more convenient.// 

**True Name:** Alexei Belitrov 

**Servant Class:** Archer

**Alignment:** Lawful Neutral 

**Attribute:** Human 

||~ Strength || A+ ||~ Mana || E+ ||
||~ Endurance || A+ ||~ Luck || E ||
||~ Agility || E+ ||~ Noble Phantasm || B+ ||

&gt; A soldier from the Red Army who partook in a World War III that took place in another world, and disappeared mysteriously following his capture by the Americans. Like all other soldiers involved in that conflict, he wore a special armour that enhances his physical abilities. Because of that, he actually has nothing special that would normally make him a Heroic Spirit. However, since he happens to be the only soldier of his native universe to have survived a journey into another universe, that counts for something. 
&gt; 
&gt; This incarnation should not be able to be summoned, since there is no account of Belitrov as a ranged fighter in this universe (the Americans removed his guns before he left his native universe). Maybe the Master who summoned Belitrov desired for a Servant in his peak condition, i.e. the perfect Soviet soldier? Or maybe Belitrov is the most compatible Heroic Spirit with the Master summoning him, and the Archer-class happens to be the only class container for him to manifest in? 

__**Class Skills**__

**Independent Action:** C

&gt; Capable of surviving in the World without a Master for one day. 

**Magic Resistance:** E

&gt; Cannot cancel spells, but damage from spells is reduced. 
&gt; 
&gt; As Archer is from the Age of Man, he has no experience with Magecraft.

__**Personal Skill**__

**Patriotic Fervour:** A+

&gt; One&#39;s love for his own country, and the willingness to protect said country and destroy those who threaten the country. 
&gt; 
&gt; Provides Rank Up to Archer&#39;s parameters when he is in territories corresponding to the Soviet Union. Provides bonus damage when attacking Servants related to the United States. 

__**Noble Phantasm**__

[[=]]
**^^Armour of the Engineers^^**
Let the Children of the Sun Implode Amongst Themselves  
[[/=]]

**Type:** Anti-Army 

**Rank:** B+

A set of bio-organic armour that conceals Archer&#39;s entire body, and with a design reminiscent of various insect species. It is a multi-functional armour crafted by the Engineers and utilized by all factions in World War III. 

As an always-active Noble Phantasm, the Armour of the Engineers grants Archer permanent bonus modifiers to its Strength and Endurance, along with additional Skills. Special lenses grants Archer C-Rank Clairvoyance, whereas its proboscis grants Archer E-Rank Bloodsucking. 

Four gun turrets are mounted on Archer&#39;s forearms and shoulder blades, serving as his primary weapons and a justification for him to be an Archer-class Servant. Due to being a Servant, ammunition produced are created from Prana and will not run out (so long he has sufficient Mana). As the Engineers&#39; creations are stained with their grudge towards humanity, bullets fired from the Armour of the Engineers carry an Anti-Human trait that deals bonus damage to all Heroic Spirits of a Human attribute. Because this Noble Phantasm&#39;s owner is also of Human attribute, Archer&#39;s Luck is lowered to E-Rank by default. 

[[/tab]]

[[tab Berserker]]

&gt; [[[SCP-2273|...tWo... twO... SeV... uH...thReE...]]]

**True Name:** SCP-2273

**Servant Class:** Berserker 

**Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral 

**Attribute:** Human 

||~ Strength || A+ ||~ Mana || E+ ||
||~ Endurance || A+ ||~ Luck || D ||
||~ Agility || E+ ||~ Noble Phantasm || EX ||

&gt; One of the many entities contained by the SCP Foundation, SCP-2273 (named Alexei Belitrov) is a being from another universe. In his native universe, he has endured capture, torture, and humiliation. Although he tries to put up a brave front, he is close to a mental breakdown. 
&gt; 
&gt; Due to his experience with war, this incarnation does not intend to battle. However, his Master intentionally summoned SCP-2273 as a Berserker since a fighter is essential in a Holy Grail War. As such, Mad Enhancement stirs Berserker into rage by force, awakening his repressed trauma and guilt.

__**Class Skill**__

**Mad Enhancement:** B

&gt; Rank Up for all parameters, but takes away most of the user&#39;s sanity. 
&gt; 
&gt; In Berserker&#39;s case, he becomes overwhelmed by his own trauma and guilt. 

__**Personal Skills**__

**Trauma of the Battlefield:** – (A)

&gt; Normally an inhibiting Skill which induces Mental Interference onto oneself, it is sealed under Mad Enhancement. 

**Containment Breach Probability:** A 

&gt; Under normal circumstances, Berserker is complaint as a contained &#34;SCP Object&#34; and this Skill should not be applicable at all. However, Mad Enhancement forcibly granted Berserker a status equivalent to the so-called &#34;Keter-class&#34;. 

**Extra-Dimensional Origin:** A

&gt; Since Berserker has travelled to another universe once, he has resistance against attacks capable of warping spacetime. 

__**Noble Phantasm**__

[[=]]
**^^Armour of the Engineers^^**
Scarred Living Armour 
[[/=]]

**Type:** Anti-Unit (Self) 

**Rank:** B

A set of bio-organic armour that conceals Beserker&#39;s entire body, and with a design reminiscent of various insect species. It is a multi-functional armour crafted by the Engineers and utilized by all factions in a World War III that took place in another universe. 

Although the Armour of the Engineers usually would have gun turrets mounted onto it, they were removed to represent the anecdote wherein the Americans disarmed Berserker after his capture. On his forearms and shoulder blades are the scars from the Americans&#39; abuse, and they remind Berserker of his shame endlessly. 

Without its primary method of attack, the Armour of the Engineers is only useful for boosting Berserker&#39;s physical parameters. On the other hand, his Luck rank is set at D instead. Supposedly, as he has been displaced from his native universe, the Engineers&#39; curse has a less potent effect on him. Or perhaps he defied his fate of being one of the Engineers&#39; instruments of dominance shift? Or perhaps Berserker found friends in this new world? 

[[=]]
**^^Danner Anomaly^^**
Breaker of Dimensions
[[/=]]

**Type:** Anti-Spacetime  

**Rank:** EX

The crystallisation of Berserker&#39;s trauma and rage over the deaths of his soldiers and displacement to another universe, it is not something Berserker possesses in life. Instead, it is the weaponised embodiment of emotions that Berserker buried in life. Now that he is in the Berserker-class, his trauma and rage erupts and engulfs his entire body. 

Every attack made by Berserker carries an Anti-Spacetime trait. These attacks are not geared to attack individual units, armies, or even fortifications. Instead, they are targeting spacetime within Berserker&#39;s range. Continuous attacks from Berserker in a given area may weaken spacetime sufficiently to break down dimensional barriers, creating a confusing battlefield on par with the Minotaur&#39;s Chaos Labyrinth. However, the destruction of spacetime will not open the portal to his native universe. After all, he never returned home in life. 

The name of the Noble Phantasm, Danner Anomaly, is derived from the town of Danner, Wisconsin. That was the place he landed following his mysterious displacement from his native universe.  

Since Berserker is ultimately a human enhanced by biotechnology and has no innate ability to break down spacetime, Danner Anomaly is essentially unquantifiable and given EX-Rank. 

[[/tab]]

[[tab Ruler]] 

&gt; My True Name is [[[SCP-2273-f|Father Anvil]]], Ruler-class. In the name of the Broken Goddess, I shall lead the final crusade against humanity&#39;s Evils in the Grand Order. 

**True Name:** Father Anvil 

**Servant Class:** Ruler  

**Alignment:** Lawful Good  

**Attribute:** Human 

||~ Strength || C ||~ Mana || D ||
||~ Endurance || A ||~ Luck || C ||
||~ Agility || C ||~ Noble Phantasm || A ||

&gt; A clergyman of the Eastern Clockwork Orthodox Church, Father Anvil was once incarcerated by the SCP Foundation as SCP-2273. An unrelated incident allowed him to be freed from the SCP Foundation, and he eventually turned to religion. Although he never received Standardisation, Father Anvil was deeply respected by members of his monastery. Although he died uneventfully, his ideals formed the basis of a greater movement that would unite humanity. 
&gt; 
&gt; Despite getting over his trauma, Father Anvil insists on pacifism. He simply refuses to partake in the Holy Grail War in any capacity, not even as a judge (the role of the Ruler-class). Normally, by sheer will, he will not be summoned in the Ruler-class. The only exception is the Grand Order, the reversion of XK-class scenarios engineered by the Seven Evils of Humanity. In Ruler&#39;s eyes, the elimination of humanity&#39;s Evils is to unite humanity and cleanse their sins. 

__**Class Skills**__

**God&#39;s Resolution:** – 

&gt; The privilege of the Ruler-class to impose absolute orders on other Servants via Command Spells, Ruler is allotted two Command Spells per participating Servant in a given Holy Grail War. Cannot re-purpose the Command Spells of others. 
&gt; 
&gt; However, since Ruler is technically presiding over a Grand Order and not a Holy Grail War, he is not granted Command Spells. 

**Magic Resistance:** C+

&gt; Cancels spells with a chant below two verses. Usually unable to defend against High Thaumaturgy or Greater Rituals. 
&gt; 
&gt; Due to Ruler&#39;s religious sect (Eastern Clockwork Orthodox Church), he can cancel any spell related to Sarkicism. 

**True Name Discernment:** B+  

&gt; Upon direct encounter with another Servant, said Servant&#39;s True Name, parameters, and skills are automatically revealed to Ruler. Regarding Servants with concealment abilities, a Luck check must be performed. 
&gt; 
&gt; Since Ruler referred to some former &#34;SCP objects&#34; by name, Servants who are/were &#34;SCP Objects&#34; will have their information revealed to Ruler, disregarding any concealment ability. 

__**Personal Skills**__

**Blessings of the Broken Goddess:** C

&gt; A form of divine protection allotted to those who follow the Broken God (a.k.a. Broken Goddess, MEKHANE, WAN, Fu Xi, Father Serpent, Metatron, Hephaestus). Damage from Servants related to Sarkicism is reduced by 50%. 
&gt; 
&gt; Because Ruler is from an heterodox sect of the Church of the Broken God, he suffers additional damage from attacks by Servants associated with the Broken Church, Cogwork Orthodox Church, and Church of Maxwell. 

**Pacifism:** C

&gt; The temperament to oppose violence in favour of peaceful settlement. Ruler gains defensive bonus so long he does not kill another human being. 
&gt; 
&gt; The low rank of this Skill brings from the fact that Ruler did engage in killing as a youth. He might have abandoned his warlike ways, but it pales in comparison to someone who disavowed violence and never engage in it. 

**Extra-Dimensional Origin:** A

&gt; Since Berserker has travelled to another universe once, he has resistance against attacks capable of warping spacetime. 

__**Noble Phantasm**__

[[=]]
**^^Our Mechanised Salvation&#39;s Grand Design^^**
We Are All Pieces of the Broken Goddess  
[[/=]]

**Type:** Anti-Mind 

**Rank:** A

The crystallisation of Ruler&#39;s spiritual ideology ever since he converted to Eastern Clockwork Orthodoxy, it is named after an idea formulated in preparation for one of Ruler&#39;s first sermons in his monastery. Notably, Ruler is one of the few who preached for inter-faith fraternity and harmony, highlighting that all humans are components of the Broken Goddess. Ruler is actually bemused that he is given such a Noble Phantasm, for he was a man of humble disposition. 

The effect of Our Mechanised Salvation&#39;s Grand Design is effectively an attempt to temporarily restore the Broken Goddess, using Ruler&#39;s philosophy as a basis. He can amalgamate the consciousness of himself and other individuals, essentially linking all of them to form a network for the Broken Goddess to be manifested upon. As the vessels of the Broken Goddess, the Attribute of all affected targets become &#39;Heaven&#39;. They also gain a level of coordination, acting as though they were one being. 

Since Ruler&#39;s sect is based on Cogwork Orthodoxy, all affected targets will gradually undergo Standardisation. However, Ruler&#39;s own willpower suppresses Standardisation. Even if he is a loyal follower of the Broken Goddess, Ruler never sees himself as worthy of Standardisation. Additionally, he might have acknowledged that other Servants might not like Standardisation forced upon them. 

Our Mechanised Salvation&#39;s Grand Design requires all affected targets&#39; consent. Should even one be forcibly targetted, the Noble Phantasm will fail. Since the Eastern Clockwork Orthodox Church is a heterodox sect of the Church of the Broken God, Servants related to other sects of the Church of the Broken God can resist Ruler&#39;s Noble Phantasm. 

Interestingly, the concept of the Broken God distributed into many individuals is echoed in the Church of Maxwell. Perhaps Cogwork Orthodoxy is not the only influence that spurred Ruler&#39;s faith.
