**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7096 manifestations are generally predictable. In the event of an unpredicted or non-intercepted SCP-7096 manifestation, responding Foundation personnel are to provide a cover explanation of retaliatory violence by the defendant in the relevant case. In situations where the manifestation is predicted and intercepted, Foundation personnel are to assist legal officials with the explanation of unexpected verdicts.

**Description:** SCP-7096 is a humanoid entity resembling 20th century Polish lawyer Ludwik Cichowicz. SCP-7096 is known to manifest during legal proceedings, most frequently in courts of international law. SCP-7096&#39;s manifestation and its ensuing impacts are not entirely predictable, but Foundation web crawler justjustice.aic has seen 97% success in predicting SCP-7096 events more than 7 days before they occur. 

SCP-7096 is, more specifically, known to appear on occasion during cases related to the exchange, control or use of land by two government entities. When a verdict or settlement in the case has been reached, SCP-7096 will manifest spontaneously within an auxiliary space (such as a storage closet or ventilation system) to the courtroom where a final verdict is being read. When the court&#39;s decision has been announced, one of the following events will occur:

* SCP-7096 will spontaneously demanifest.
* SCP-7096 will exit the auxiliary space and enter the courtroom, using whatever force necessary to bypass courtroom security. SCP-7096 will approach the presiding officer of the court, and inflict by unknown means an injury on the official- removing a section of the official&#39;s body proportional to the amount of land lost in the court&#39;s settlement.

**Addendum 1: Details of Discovery**

SCP-7096 first appeared on January 11, 1976. The International Court of Justice was hearing a case at the time related to water access rights. The Plaintiff was the nation of Brazil, who had filed a claim against bordering Bolivia. When the court ruled in favor of Brazil, ordering Bolivia to yield two percent of their land by area, SCP-7096 made its first known appearance. The below is a transcript of events in the court during the incident, translated from Spanish.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

//Verdict reading is in progress.//

**Head Judge Alexi Acciptara:** In case 1976-6678, the International Court of Justice has reached the following decision: 

This court rules entirely and completely in favor of the Plaintiff, the Federative Republic of Brazil. All lands claimed in the case are to be transferred immediately and without conditions by the Republic of Bolivia.

//Unknown individual exits storage closet at corner of courtroom, near auxiliary hallway.//

**Security Guard:** Hey, what are you doing there? HEY! STOP!

//Commotion in the courtroom as the individual storms toward Acciptara, rushing up the main aisle of the courtroom between the two sides, evading security personnel with quick, agile movements.//

**Acciptara:** Hey! Get this guy away from- [Untranslatable, expression of pain]

//Acciptara suddenly loses two fingers, which detach and fall onto the desk in front of him. Medical staff rush to the scene as the unknown individual disappears spontaneously.//

Foundation personnel within the ICJ soon became aware of the disappearing assailant. The anomaly was designated SCP-7096 and attempts to determine SCP-7096&#39;s modus operandi began. The History and Archives Department eventually identified SCP-7096 as Ludwik Chicowicz, a Polish Government Lawyer who had died in 1940. 


**Addendum 2: Selected Further Incidents**

SCP-7096 manifested for a second time on September 24, 1991. An International Court of Justice case related to the determination of a new border between Germany and Poland following said nations&#39; independence was briefly delayed after a loud noise within the building&#39;s ventilation system concerned security staff. Security personnel informed Foundation staff at the ICJ of an SCP-7096 manifestation, however, this time, no injuries were reported.

On August 3, 1999, a settlement by the European Union Territorial Authority found that the nation of Luxembourg was required to transfer a small forest to  Belgium, which nonetheless made up exactly half of Luxembourg&#39;s land area.  Within a minute of the verdict&#39;s reading, SCP-7096 appeared and injured three ICJ security personnel before bisecting and killing presiding official Matthew Reibaum. An autopsy performed by Foundation personnel found SCP-7096 had, with over 99.999999994% precision, bisected Reibaum at exactly his vertical midpoint. Due to the nature of the case, Foundation personnel determined SCP-7096 was attempting retaliation for unsatisfactory verdicts.

Following this event, 19 events have been mitigated by the addition of security measures to auxiliary areas of courtrooms in which relevant cases are decided. SCP-7096 will manifest, but demanifest a few moments later, if any individual visually witnesses its appearance. Thus, Foundation personnel have been stationed within areas such as ventilation shafts to ensure no area goes unmonitored during the reading of verdicts. --2-- 3 unmitigated events have occurred since. 

**Addendum 3: Neutralization Incident** On September 3, 2021, SCP-7096 appeared during the reading of a verdict in United States vs. Nevada, a case related to federal land ownership, despite the presence of over one hundred individuals in the courtroom. Unlike previous occurrences, SCP-7096 appeared in the center of the room, directly next to the jury. SCP-7096 demanifested three seconds later. 

A piece of paper remained on the jurors&#39; desk after SCP-7096&#39;s demanifestation. During the chaos caused by witnesses&#39; shock at the anomalous event, Foundation personnel acquired the paper. The below is a translation of a Polish-language statement that was handwritten on the paper. 

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

There was a time, not long ago, that a small panel of men sat in a smoke-filled room, and severed portions of the world from their rightful owners as they wished. 

But this is not that time. It is my unfortunate situation to have reacted so inappropriately to what I falsely believed a parallel to my own fate, that my actions resulted in loss of life.

When Poland was divided, the loss of my homeland stayed with me beyond the grave. And I can only express, in hopes of your forgiveness, that I did not expect such great improvement in the process of land transfer.

It was my hope to never again see land pilfered from its rightful owner, to never see a people oppressed by a foreign power again. Of course, it remains a frequent occurrence in the world, but the courts should never have been the target of my wrath. Instead, they are perhaps the first way land has ever been peacefully or reasonably transferred! 

The assumptions of my era, that any conference on a nation&#39;s fate would end so unfairly, cannot be applied to yours. 

When the day comes that I can again serve the world genuinely, I shall. But the process your era has found effective will go unimpeded. I shall return, but not to stop what you have chosen. 

Until then, I can only express joy that you have chosen to be better men than your fathers.

SCP-7096 presents the extremely rare situation of a written statement from an anomaly promising to cease anomalous activity. While the anomaly continues to exist, it is unlikely to resume any undesirable activities. In the event that SCP-7096 does not appear at three consecutive predicted manifestations, the anomaly will be reclassified as Neutralized.

**Addendum 4: Final Statement**

As of August 30, 2022, SCP-7096 has been reclassified as Neutralized as three likely appearances have gone by without a manifestation. In addition, Foundation Facial Recognition technology has identified SCP-7096 four times within the last six months within videos from Ukraine&#39;s International Legion.</textarea></pre>
