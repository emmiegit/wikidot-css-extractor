**Item #:** SCP-7990

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7990 is to be held within a containment locker in Site-78&#39;s library. Foundation webcrawlers are to find any listings of SCP-7990-A instances being sold on online marketplaces and take them down. Once the location of an instance has been identified, MTF Chi-29 &#34;(Rugrats)&#34; is to be deployed for instance retrieval.

Due to the discovery made in Addendum 7990.03, no further cross-testing is to be performed between SCP-7990 and any book in the Set of Nine[[footnote]] A set of anomalous books engraved with roman numerals [[/footnote]].

**Description:** SCP-7990 is a worn 3-ring spiral notebook with the roman numerals, &#34;X of IX&#34; scrawled into the bottom of the front cover. Despite it&#39;s superficial resemblance to other books in the Set of Nine, such as [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6419 |SCP-6419]]], it is not a part of it. The cover itself reads &#34;[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dado-hub dado] guide to designer rugs.&#34; Inside of the SCP-7990 lies recipes for the construction of various rugs. The recipes for the instances follow a similar pattern, the reader must:
* Place the notebook close to the construction area[[footnote]] Foundation research has determined this be within 4.5 meters. [[/footnote]]
* Obtain a form of carpeting
* Place the required ingredients on the rug

Doing so will create an instance of SCP-7990-A, a carpet with anomalous properties that change based on what recipe was used. These effects can vary wildly depending on the recipe, from creating living creatures to moving and creating matter.


**Discovery:** SCP-7990 came to the Foundation&#39;s attention when law enforcement officers in Sandusky, Ohio performed a drug bust on the lab of Christopher Miller, a street chemist. Inside of his lab, the officers found not drugs but various rugs instead. The officers who were around several of the rugs reported hallucinations and other symptoms commonly associated with various street drugs. Foundation agents embedded in the Sandusky forensics department alerted the Foundation when text messages to dado were found on Miller&#39;s recovered phone along with an instance of SCP-7990-A later identified as a &#34;hume rug&#34; that appeared to be made entirely of Miller&#39;s hair. 

Chi-29 was deployed to the scene to recover SCP-7990 and SCP-7990-A instances as well administering Amnestics to all affected. Analysis of the recipes contained inside discovered the following that shed light on the &#34;hume rug&#34; that appeared to be the remains of Christopher Miller.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Recipe #76**: hume rug

**Ingredient:** 
* 1 human

**Addendum 7990.01:** Recovered text messages

The following is an excerpt of the messages obtained from Miller&#39;s phone. Miller is represented in blue while dado is in red.

**Test log #1**



**Recipe used:** #2: crack rug
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Ingredient:** 
* 1 crack
* 1 rug

**Description:** dado better than cartel, dado figure out how to get more bang for buck. crack rug good for whole party.

[[/div]]


**Test Summary:** D-8475, D-8956 and D-3453 were instructed to place 30 grams of crack cocaine on the carpet provided. The crack cocaine proceeded to dissolve into the rug. Thirty seconds later, the rug audibly sneezed and a cloud of cocaine that exceeded the original amount used, dispersed into the air. The cloud expanded to a radius of 30 meters. 

The D-Class proceeded to experience the symptoms of cocaine overdose. The D-Class quickly became hyperactive and started yelling about various topics. For safety reasons, the D-Class were given narcan afterwards and returned to their cells.


[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Test log #3**

**Recipe used:** #7: dado flying carpet
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Ingredient:** 
* 1 jet engeen
* 1 rug

**Description:** dado go zoom zoom like aladdin. with dado flying carpet you go anywhere.

[[/div]]

**Test Summary:** A crane was used to move a TRS 18 jet engine on to a regular sized carpet. The carpet anomalously stretched to consume the engine and after a minute of shaking it returned back to normal. D-4654 was then instructed to step on the carpet and see what happens.

D-4654 stepped on the carpet which rose up 3 meters in the air before accelerating to 320 Km/h and [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Researcher&#39;s notes:** Further tests are to be conducted in a cell with an open roof. Christ, we&#39;ll be cleaning this cell for days. I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t think of this beforehand, my bad. -Researcher Chudley

[[/div]]


[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Test log #6**

**Recipe used:** #13: dado of the dado may cry series
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Ingredient:** 
* 1 fanart of dado
* 1 tapestry

**Description:** dado famous anime man. dado could be hung up on wall and idolized by teenage boys everywhere. it dado showtime, come on!

[[/div]]
**Test Summary:** D-0943 was told to draw what they thought a man named &#34;dado&#34; could look like and to place it on the wall tapestry provided. The tapestry then transformed into an instance of SCP-7990-A that resembled a wall scroll with a much more detailed drawing of dado in an anime style wielding a sword and a gun.

**Researcher&#39;s notes:** dado made a recipe to make sexy anime man wall scrolls of himself? That&#39;s.... entirely reasonable - Researcher Chudley. 

[[/div]]


[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Test log #9**

**Recipe used:** #13: dado end of world scenario
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Ingredient:** 
* 1 globe
* 1 banana
* 1 rug

**Description:** other artist have idea about what end of world look like. dado also have idea, you sell dado art in museum and make both lots of money.

[[/div]]

**Test summary:** D-3784 placed the requisite items on the rug which consumed the items and transformed into a Banana themed instance of SCP-7990-A. Nothing occurred until a minute later when a banana appeared in the room. Another minute passed and two bananas spawned. After thirty minutes when the exponential banana growth showed no sign of stopping, a member of MTF Chi-29 entered the room and torched the instance before any more damage could be done.

**Researcher&#39;s notes:** Bananas? dado thinks the world will end with infinite bananas? I mean they were tasty but the last thing we needed was another SCP-873 on our hands. - Researcher Chudley


[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Test log #11**

**Recipe used:** #21: if pig could fly
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Ingredient:** 
* 1 Pig
* 1 Pear green falcon
* 1 rug

**Description:** can pig fly? dado think pig should fly! all pig fly and also be rug!

[[/div]]

**Test summary:** D-6543 was instructed to herd the rowdy animals onto the rug which quickly subsumed them into a living instance of SCP-7990-A. The resulting creature resembled a Pig made of linen with two large wings protruding from its back. The linen pig displayed the ability to fly around the testing chamber with little issue. The SCP-7990-A pig instance was placed in with the other pigs in the Site-78 pens to live out the rest of it&#39;s life.

**Researcher&#39;s notes:** Pigs certainly bring back memories for me both good and bad. At least they aren&#39;t dying horribly. I&#39;ve dubbed the flying Pig as &#34;Cold Pignic[[footnote]] Play on Cold Picnic, a New Zealand based rug company. [[/footnote]]&#34; and he will live a happy life. -  Researcher Chudley



[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Test log #13**

**Recipe used:** #28: dado tele rug
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Ingredient:** 
* 1 piece of paper with lat and long
* 1 rug

**Description:** sometime you wanna go place that have rug with no transport. so dado will make it so you can go to rug from rug!

[[/div]]

**Test summary:** D-1243 was instructed to write the coordinates of one place that they have always wanted to go. D-1243 decided on Paris, France and they were given the coordinates for Paris. After the carpet absorbed the paper, they stepped on the rug and ended up in the bedroom of a prominent French politician.

This caused a slight scandal as the politician came home to find the D-Class in their bedroom with their wife in the bathroom. SCP-FR quickly moved to amnescitize the couple once their location was found and any media covering the scandal was covered up.

**Researcher&#39;s notes:** Well in true dado fashion, it appears if you don&#39;t specifically say what rug you&#39;d like to teleport to; it chooses a random rug or carpet ANYWHERE in the location you wanted.  -Researcher Chudley


[[/div]]







**Addendum 7990.03:** Video log of test #15

After discovering a particular recipe inside of SCP-7990, Researcher Chudley requested Site Director Richter to use SCP-6952 with SCP-7990 as the recipe called for a book from the Set of Nine. Richter accepted the proposal and the following footage was recorded by Research Chudley from the test.


[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

[Begin recording]

**Chudley:** This is Greg Chudley, supervising researcher on the Set of Nine. This will be test number fifteen on SCP-7990, just waiting for Researcher Johnston to arrive with the anomaly.

[Chudley turns as Researcher Maria Johnston enters the room with two members of MTF Omega-45 &#34;(Street Samurai)&#34;]

**Chudley:** Johnston, it&#39;s good see you again. I take it you&#39;ve brought the book?

[One of the MTF hands Johnston an adamantine case which she unlocks with her key card and procures SCP-6952.]

**Johnston:** Same to you, Chudley. I thought you were in Pataphysics?

**Chudley:** There&#39;s been a general lack of new anomalies in Pataphysics, so Richter had me transferred to better use my talents elsewhere.

**Johnston:** Must have been boring then with nothing to do in Pataphysics, how were you keeping busy?

**Chudley:** [Chudley laughs.] Don&#39;t tell Richter but.... [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7400 League of Legends].

**Johnston:** (//sighs//) Same old, Chudley. Anyways, what is this test? I thought Director Richter said the books were to remain apart, this isn&#39;t even a part of the Set of Nine.

**Chudley:** Well, hear me out alright? While we were analyzing the recipes, I found this. [Chudley grabs SCP-7990 and flips to the back of it.] Ahem, &#34;recipe number 78: misery reveal. ingredient, 1 of famous book, 1 rug. description: do you want to know more about author of books? dado certainly do. place one of nine book on carpet and the vision of author be revealed.&#34;

**Johnston:** Well that certainly sounds like he&#39;s talking about the Set of Nine. I get your line of thinking though, this might be our first clue on who wrote these things. So what do I do, just drop the book onto the carpet you have laying here?

**Chudley:** Just don&#39;t step on it.

**Johnston:** What happens if I do?

**Chudley:**  Do you want to be a rug?

**Johnston:** No?

**Chudley:** Then avoid stepping on it.

[Johnston holds SCP-6952 over the rug and drops the anomaly onto the carpet. The carpet rolls up over the books and begins shaking and trembling. It then unfurls and tosses SCP-6952 into Researcher Johnston&#39;s hands. The book suddenly opens and flips to a certain page.]

**Johnston:** &#34;Incompatible book recognized. Please place with the other eight books in order to...&#34; forge the ultimate weapon?

**Chudley:** So there is a point to gathering all nine.... Oh, Johnston. There&#39;s a note on the carpet.

[The newly created instance of SCP-7990-A has a piece of paper lying on it. Researcher Chudley picks up the note and reads from it.]

**Chudley:** &#34;Do not associate my work with cheap copies. You&#39;ve only found two pieces of the puzzle thus far, seven remain. Good luck. -Corra&#34; ....Corra[[footnote]] Name of the Celtic snake goddess of life, death, fertility, and wisdom. [[/footnote]]? Well at least we have name now.
