**Item #:** SCP-5813-1

**Object Class:** Neutralized (Formerly Keter)

**Special Containment Procedures:** As SCP-5813-1 is considered neutralized, further containment is deemed unnecessary. Its body is held in Area-179&#39;s anomalous entity cryogenic storage. Performing research on the cadaver is available to all staff Level 3 or higher.


**Description:** SCP-5813-1 is a male humanoid, 1.81m in height, which is biologically non-anomalous and physically identical to SCP-5813. The entity was created in 1854 as a combined effort by the Foundation and PoI-466[[footnote]]Doctor Cornelius Waksmundski, a well-known alchemist operating within Boston, MA in the mid-to-late 19th century.[[/footnote]] to keep knowledge of SCP-5813&#39;s anomalous nature from becoming public.

SCP-5813-1 possesses knowledge typical of a subject serving public office but is incapable of taking a stance or making decisions without authorization from its handlers. The entity is fully versed in previous decisions made by SCP-5813 as well as its perceived history.  

SCP-5813-1 was found deceased in its containment area on 1874/3/8. On 1874/3/9, the entity dispensed a note from its mouth during its autopsy, a transcript of which can be found below.

**Addendum: 5813-1-1- LEVEL-5 SECURITY CLEARANCE REQUIRED**
&gt; To whom it may concern,
&gt; 
&gt; I was delighted to know that I was not the only one to have found something strange in our dear former president, but I did not expect it to affect you lot! When you approached me with your dilemma, I jumped for joy. You had tried to make your own &#39;little misters&#39;, but they just didn&#39;t work out. Our combined efforts have created something beautiful, my friends.
&gt;   
&gt; I&#39;ve had a toy line in mind for quite some time, but never really had anyone to test it on... But you are among my greatest collectors, and I am honored to announce that you were the proud owners of a custom-made, one of a kind, never before seen, never will be seen again, honorary, celebratory, inauguratory, little mister!
&gt; 
&gt; That&#39;s right; though it appears your trial has run out, __you__ were the very first to own a little mister! But don&#39;t get too comfortable, as soon there will be more to collect! Collect them all and become Mr. Collector!
&gt; 
&gt; Just sign below, and solidify your name as the proud collector of our premiere little mister: Mr. President!
&gt; 
&gt; @@X___________________________________________@@
&gt; 
&gt; Eternally yours;
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. &#39;Wondertainment&#39; (Does that sound proper?)
