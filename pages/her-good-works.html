------

 

Alarms blare.

The corridor is painted in crimson again and again as lights flare about her head.

Site-84 was a relatively remote and rarely saw any form of interference from the Foundation let alone their rivals.&#39;

Yet it appeared something had sparked the interest of some GoI or another, and the sounds of distant shouts and gunfire echoed in the base of her hearing.

Yet, none of it truly mattered.

Not in the moment.

No, Waller needed to get to the Archive.

It was paramount. 

Some primal drive deep in her heart to protect something, but her mind couldn&#39;t quite understand what was driving her to do so.

Her hand absentmindedly fumbles with Erende&#39;s key cards, her thumb tracing along the edge of one in particular. She&#39;d snatched them the moment the alarms started, that nebulous drive demanding she do so.

&#34;What am I doing?&#34; she muttered, as a gun shot cracks from somewhere far too close for comfort.

Opening the door to the Archive, she darts inside, quietly closing it behind her, and setting the lock as she finds herself turning almost automatically to stare at the locker containing SCP-7042. 

&#34;You?&#34; she murmurs, feeling that pull tugging at something deep within her brain, a need with no place, a want with no foundation, the desire picking at a blank space in her brain.

A cry of pain breaks her of her stupor, muffled by the door, but closer than before. Whomever had invaded the facility was approaching.

&#34;They&#39;re after you?&#34; she whispered, grappling with the two facets of confusion swirling about in her brain.

Instinct takes over, and Waller swiftly marches towards the storage locker.

SCP-7042 is in her hands before she can evern really think of what she is doing.

It was still warm to the touch, as if it had been set beneath the sun for hours, oddly comforting and so jarringly familiar that once more the chaos around her seemed to vanish.

The sketchbook opened, fluttering it&#39;s pages, a childish yawn echoing in her head. The empty space ached.

The pencil rises, ticking back and forth in the air slowly, before it begins to write.

&#34;DR. WALLER?&#34; 

&#34;HELLO?!&#34;

&#34;WHY?!&#34;

&#34;NOT. MAD???&#34;

It&#39;s pages flutter in excitement.

//&#34;Mad about what?&#34;// she&#39;d thought, fighting to understand why the entity was so excited to see her. Why she had been drawn here in the first place. Erende had been in charge of testing with the object. She had never set foot in the testing chamber...hadn&#39;t she.

Yet as it rested in her hands, a sense of rightness overcame her.

And the hollow in her head felt more and more wrong.

&#34;WHAT? IS SOUND?&#34; SCP-7042 asked, tapping her hand with the end of it&#39;s pencil.

Steel impacting steel was echoing behind her.

&#34;Someone is...I think someone is after you.&#34; Waller stated, surprised as how easy it is to hold a conversation with the item.

&#34;PROTECT.&#34; the SCP wrote.

&#34;I, I can try.&#34; Waller returned, looking around for an item to defend herself with.

&#34;NO! I. PROTECT. YOU.&#34; it responded, shaking it&#39;s pencil in her face as it finishes. &#34;FIX. MISTAKE. PLEASE? TRUST?&#34;

Another heavy crash strikes against the door, and a muffled yell calls out, &#34;Someone is in there with it!&#34;

The pounding became more frantic.

&#34;O-okay.&#34; Waller stated.

&#34;WRITE.&#34; 7042 responded, the pencil slipping up into her hand, brining forth another feeling of alien familiarity.

She paused, before writing down, &#34;Guardian&#34;.

That is where it all seemed to blur together, the book sketching swiftly and some great beast of muslce, bony spurs and thick hide emerged as the door crashed open.

She&#39;d run, as this creature flung the invaders about like paper dolls, SCP-7042 clutched tightly to her chest. One of them had been sent crashing into the wall before her, and she swore she saw an MTF patch on their mangled shoulder, before the &#34;Guardian&#34; came storming towards her, gun fire pinging of it&#39;s back.

------

Waller wakes up with a start, hand instincitively reaching for the pistol at her bed side.

John looks up with surprise, &#34;Morning, boss.&#34;

John Matthers. He&#39;d been part of Site-84 before reassignment, just like her, but as it became clear that cracks were forming in the Foundation, many found their way to her, feeling the same call, that same empty echo. Now, that echo had been filled, memories returned from a time where they realized all the good they were being refused from doing.

&#34;What time is it?&#34; Waller asks, putting the gun down and looking around blearily.

&#34;4:30...in the afternoon.&#34; John states with a smirk, &#34;I get yesterday was rough, but we&#39;ve got a schedule to keep.&#34;

Waller rolls her eyes, rubs her face and sits back, &#34;Is Daina back yet?&#34; 

&#34;No, had a sighting of some more Clankers on the edge of town, she&#39;s leading them away.&#34; John returns, &#34;We might need to make this quick.&#34;

&#34;She&#39;s been ready for days.&#34; Waller mutters, &#34;I&#39;m just worried, the last time we did this-&#34;

&#34;We had Castaways on our doorsteps within the hour.&#34; John finishes, standing up and stretching his back, before kneeling down and lifting up the immense sledgehammer he&#39;d claimed as a weapon near the beginning of this grand adventure.

&#34;We&#39;re prepared now and they&#39;re not. Tied up with a good bunch of fuckery happening back in the States, all hands, all told.&#34; he states, attempting to bolster her worries, handing over a cup of coffee.

&#34;And the Clankers?&#34; Waller asks, getting to her feet and walking towards where Sketch was resting.

&#34;Nothing for you on that front unfortunatly, might be the Cogs, but I we don&#39;t know what //we&#39;ve// done to upset the Church.&#34; he chuckles.

For months she had been on the move, more and more people gathering to her side, but not hers truly, no they were all coming for sketch. Former members of Site-84, workers from Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions, the Serpent&#39;s Hand, even a handful of anamolous entities. She wasn&#39;t sure how Sketch was doing it, or if she even was, but the all claimed that something deep inside, something ancient was demanding they find her.

&#34;You awake?&#34; Waller asks, playfully tapping Sketch&#39;s cover.

&#34;ALWAYS!&#34; the book writes after she unfurls, &#34;TODAY? THE DAY?&#34; 

&#34;Yes, kiddo.&#34; Waller returns with a grin, as the book&#39;s pages dance playfully.

She scoops her up and heads outside, the warm air of Apia greating her as she looks down upon the city stretching before them. Below dozens of people were waiting, milling about and she knew even more would be waiting at the observatory.

&#34;Today&#39;s the day.&#34; she mutters, looking up to John as he enters, &#34;Isn&#39;t it?&#34;

&#34;Doc, we&#39;re going to be fine. We were 42, now there&#39;s hundreds of us.&#34; John assures.

&#34;But they aren&#39;t all here.&#34; she rebutts.

&#34;Because we need to get the message out.&#34; John states, speaking her own old talking points back at her, &#34;And once it&#39;s down, who knows we could have...&#34;.

&#34;4200.&#34; Waller finishes.

&#34;As a start, now let&#39;s move.&#34; he states, patting her shoulder and hefting his hammer. 

------
Waller stares out at the ocean, turning back to see the numerous of faces looking back at her, there were dozens of them, many holding up phones and video recorders, others throwing care to the wind and holding up tiny holes in space and time, allowing her message to reach numerous anamalous bastions.

Diana had returned, a bit worse for wear but still wearing her constant defiant smirk, she and John were perched on the edge of the docks beside her, eyes scanning for any further interruptions.

Waller looks down at Sketch, &#34;You ready?&#34;

&#34;ALWAYS. LET. US. FIX.&#34; Sketch returns.

&#34;Right, here we go.&#34; Waller mutters, turning to full face the crowd.

&#34;For too long has the Foundation allowed normalcy to take prescedent over our world&#39;s health.&#34; she states, and severl cries of aggreance echo back from the crowd.

&#34;Is it not abberant to allow our forest&#39;s to be clear cut, for species to be condemned to extinction?&#34; she demands, and the crowd grows more and more agitated.

&#34;Has greed blinded them as readily as it has those outside the Mascarade? What are they protecting if they allow the corrupt to carve out world to pieces? Gaea isn&#39;t a myth, she is as real as any of us! Yet, they seem keen on allowing the unaware to carve her to ribbons and let use choke on what remains!&#34; 

More people were joining, citizens with no knowledge of the anamolous, likely believing her to be insane, or acting out some curious poetic piece. It didn&#39;t matter, she just needed them to see, to know, that there was a way to fix their World. Sketch, was just the beginning, but together they would put on a show that would crack the veil right open. It was what was best. Allowing Sketch to work was best.

&#34;What is worse, they&#39;ve condemned entire people, entire species to extinction because they didn&#39;t fit into what is Normal! They&#39;ve outright slaughtered several of them!&#34;

Several voices echo above the others, eyes being drawn as two SCP-1000 throw back their hoods, and cries of shock echo amongst the gathered civilians, many bringing out their own phones.

Good.

&#34;Gaea&#39;s heart bleeds, and they refused to patch the wound. So we will step up, staring today.&#34; she cries and a cheer races through the assembled members of her group, while the citizens share confused and frightened glances.

Turning she quickly writes in Sketch, and allows her to take over, waiting with a nervous grin.

Then the gun fire started.

She whirls, ducking to the ground as out the crowd, several Clankers emerged, pistons, cogs and metallic limbs sheering free of disguising clothing, and in some cases false flesh. 

&#34;Don&#39;t stop.&#34; Waller states, setting Sketch down, but she knows the object is too consumed by her own work to notice the intrusion.

The reactions by her group were immediate, guns emerging from beneath clothes, many turning with magic burning on their fingers, rocks tore free of the ground, shields rose and out of the throngue Diana and John were the first to engage in melee as the citizens began to scatter, though some remained, gawking wide-eyed with their phones twitching back and forth as if the latter had taken control of their bodies. 

Diana, struck the lead Clanker hard, lunging free of the crowd, lengthy avian talons emerging from her fingers. A Sarkic, Black Lodge, why she had come to Sketch, Waller had no idead, but she was devoted and //strong// and right now that was all that mattered.

&#34;Damn tin cans.&#34; John swears, swinging his sledge hammer towards the nearest Clanker within reach.

The cyborg swiveled, attempt to block the blow with their own blade, but he feints and cracks the hammer into their hip.

A splash of red liquid covers the ground as the blow turns what flesh remains into runny paste.

The cyborg glances down in confusion and back up.

&#34;Good thing you&#39;re not all metal.&#34; John snarls, bringing the hammer around again, &#34;But I&#39;m sure this will buff out.&#34;

Waller takes aim, firing several shots, bullets burying into the forms of the attacking Clankers, but seemingly doing little to slow them down. The others barrage, however, was pushing them back. 

She glances back and sees Sketch write, &#34;DONE!&#34;

All they had to do was wait.

//1.//

Diana cries out as one of the Cyborg pierces a blade through her right shoulder.

//2.//

//3.//

//4.//

One of the SCP-1000 tears towards it, cinderblock sized fists coming down on top of it&#39;s head, denting the metal headcase in, blood and oil spurts from it&#39;s mechanical eye sockets.

//5.//

//6.//

//7.//

John is shot through the leg, his swing falter but still managing to connect with the next clanker, their torso erupting with red liquid.

//8.//

//9.//

//10.//

One of the Serpent&#39;s Hand mages, claps their hand together and thick vines burst from their shoulder blades, wrapping around several Clankers and wrenching them from the ground.

//15.//

In return one of the Clanker opens fire with an underslung machine gun, cracking through several shields, members of her group dropping as bullets find purchase.

//20.// 

Diana charges it, the concentrated fire turning her torso to swiss cheese, but she keeps going, talons lancing up and piecing through the base of it&#39;s jaw up through the soft pallete and into the brain, blood seeping from her lips even as her body begins to knit back together.

//25.//

One of the remaining Clankers, begins to sprint, surging through the crowd, a sharp beeping hitting the air as it picks up more and more speed, aiming right for Waller and Sketch.

//30.// 

She opens fire, even as the sun suddenly goes dark, an immense shadow overtaking the entire observatory and extending far into the distance. 

Her bullets ping against the Clanker&#39;s metallic carapace, and right before it reaches her John&#39;s sledge caves clean through it&#39;s head, pulpy debris flying everywhere and goes spinning into a nearby wall. The other SCP-1000 instance races forward and picking it up like a discuss chucks the stumbling body over the edge towards the surf below. Waller looks back and sees the other SCP-1000 standing in a throwing postion, a limping John patting them on the back.

Meanwhile, the rest of her assembled group and the remaining civilians are no longer paying attention to her or the carnage about them. Instead their eyes tilt ever skyward.

She scoops up Sketch as she turns, and follows their gaze, as looming over her were four examples of a species lost to the Foundation&#39;s erroneous ministrations. 

An older citizen gasps, and falls to her knees, &#34;Polo&#39;ongakau.&#34;

&#34;Did you make them like we talked about?&#34; Waller asks, looking down to sketch.

Sketch flutters her pages happily, &#34;YES! NO MORE. LOOK-SICKNESS.&#34;

&#34;Good girl.&#34; Waller remarks, tapping her fingers along the book&#39;s pages, elliciting a small giggle. 

She turns back to the assembled group, staring into one of the nearest cameras.

&#34;Now, you can see what Gaea&#39;s Sketchbook can do in the right hands.&#34; Waller states.

The creatures shimmered as they began to walk away, one lowering it&#39;s vast head to stare at the tiny assembled beings before it before turning and following the others, a booming call that felt like if an earthquake could sing echoing all around them.

&#34;We are Gaea&#39;s 42 and we are just getting started.&#34; Waller states, and a cheers errupt all around her.

------

The video ends, and the sole viewer rests his head on his hands, as he looks down at several papers scattered across his desk.

Central is a single sheet of paper marked with an upside-down triangle, that for a brief second appears to ripple before his very eyes.

&#34;Waller...what brave new world are you forcing us into?&#34; Erende mutters, shutting off the light and departing the room.
