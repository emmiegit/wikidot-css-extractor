//Pitter patter, pitter patter//.
Heads turn and papers scatter.
Pages wonder what&#39;s the matter
As The Calico comes to the &#39;Brary.

No one knows where they came from,
if there&#39;s several or only one.
But everyone knows when the time comes
for The Calico to appear in the &#39;Brary.

They appear to people down on luck,
Who cannot keep their lives abuck,
And can truly say that it all sucks
&#39;Til The Calico comes to the &#39;Brary.

But only when Yuletide arrives,
Where merriment and joy thrives,
Does it happen to change their lives
And The Calico visits the &#39;Brary.

It could be something very small
Like reunion with a childhood ball.
But you can&#39;t truly guess it all
When The Calico comes to the &#39;Brary.

Do you hear it? The pitter of paws.
You need not worry about the claws.
It&#39;s a relief and not just &#39;cause
The Calico is at the &#39;Brary.

A quiet meow, a trilling purr.
They have arrived, that&#39;s for sure.
Your spirits are lifted, and the cure
is The Calico in the &#39;Brary.
