Everyone knows the Library for the vast array of texts in the shelves, but oft overlooked are the illustrations, tucked away on embossed hardcovers and in between pages. Pictures can be what brings a story to life -- offering a visual to the mind&#39;s eye, letting patrons imagine ideas that they would otherwise never have seen. But in the Library, the pictures and pictographs that inhabit the books can have a mind of their own. They think, they speak, they have feelings and desires -- and sometimes, they move. Every so often, pictures that are unhappy in their story of residence will elect to leave, hoping the legions of authors in the Library will be kind enough to craft them the new homes they desire. Of course, our generous Patrons are more than happy to oblige -- aren&#39;t you?

This contest, we&#39;re doing something a little odd: everyone who wants to join will have to submit two CC-compatible images to enter, and then they&#39;ll be shuffled around and everyone will get one image that they&#39;ll have to write an article around! Fun, right? Fun!
----
+ Rules
# The Submission Period will begin on August 23th and end on **23:59EST August 30th**. At that point, images will be finalized and sent out. When you receive your image on September 1st, the Writing Period begins, and will continue until the Posting Period begins on **00:01EST September 15th**. The Posting period is a week long and ends on **23:59EST September 22nd**, and then the Voting Period and the contest ends on **23:59EST September 30th**, when results are announced and winners crowned.
# **To enter, you must submit two license-compatible images, so that means Creative Commons or Public Domain only. You will be asked to provide sources for them, just so we can confirm. You can submit an image you found, or even one you took or made! They just have to be CC or Public Domain.** 
 # Images should not be NSFW in content, or licensed as NC (noncommercial) or ND (nonderivative). Contest runners have the final say on whether an image can be submitted, and may reject images if deemed appropriate. __AI-generated artwork is currently not allowed on the site due to licensing ambiguity, and thus should not be submitted for the contest.__
 # [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page Wikimedia Commons] &amp; [https://wordpress.org/openverse/ Openverse] are good sources to look for CC images. We&#39;re probably not going to be accepting images that are from shady sites with no confirmation of license, so try to keep it to those sites for the best chances.
# **To enter, make a comment in the discussion of this page linking your two images along with a statement confirming you plan to participate.**
# The image you get will be the only image you can use in that article.
# Every author may only submit one entry; collaborations are not allowed for this contest. Entries will be tagged with {{picturepalooza2022}}.
# In the event of extenuating circumstances, you may submit a request to the contest organizers to receive a different image. Please do not use this just because the image doesn’t inspire you.
# The image you receive must be used in the article, but the how and why are up to you. 
# Shenanigans Rule: The contest organizers reserve the right to disqualify entries and entrants for behavior they deem unsportsmanlike, such as downvoting other contestants&#39; entries solely to gain a vote advantage or excessively self-promoting their articles. If you&#39;re not sure whether or not your action will fall under the Shenanigans Rule, ask either [[*user ROUNDERHOUSE]] or [[*user Rumetzen]].
# The winners will receive one feature pick each for the months of October and November.

**A note from your contest organizer:** This is a give and take situation. Please try and consider before submitting images that doing so means you&#39;ll also have to write something around another image. 
----
+ Dates
**Submission Period** – for people to submit images and join the contest:  **00:01EST 8/23** –**23:59EST 8/30**
**Writing Period** – to write a draft incorporating the image you’ve been given: **00:01EST 9/1** – **23:59EST 9/15**
