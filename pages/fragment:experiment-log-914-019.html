-----------------------
**Test 914-1900**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Evangeline Perry
**Date:** 24/02/2022
**Total Items:** One //Nintendo Switch// cartridge of the game //Pokémon Sword//

**Input:** One //Nintendo Switch// cartridge of the game //Pokémon Sword//
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A modified cartridge. While the game is largely similar, the player character will automatically change in appearance along with the team of Pokémon when different people play the game. During gameplay, it is not possible to box members of the team. New Pokémon can be caught, but they cannot be retrieved from the PC. Trading and breeding are similarly not possible, and the player will not receive a starter at the beginning of the game.

|| J.R. Perry || The Pokémon team consists of Alolan Raticate, Chansey, Dedenne, Porygon-Z,  Noctowl, and Musharna.||
|| Intern Beauvillier || The Pokémon team consists of Farfetch&#39;d, Wobbuffet, Reuniclus, Unown, Klinklang, and Porygon-Z. ||
|| J.R. Boneka || The Pokémon team consists of Alcremie, Appletun, Bounsweet, Noibat, Slurpuff, and Cherubi. ||
|| R. MacLean || The Pokémon team consists of Spiritomb, Porygon-Z, Ditto, Dusknoir, Empoleon, and Drifblim. ||
|| Dr. Veritas || The Pokémon team consists of Alakazam, Electrode, Gyarados, Vespiquen, Cofagrigus and Hydreigon. ||

//Note: I&#39;m curious why it chose these Pokémon for me. - J.R. Perry//

//Note: It appears that my selection is largely composed of dessert and fruit-themed Pokémon specifically. So my theory is that everyone&#39;s team is based off of Pokémon that match their personality or interests; some of the choices are really obvious, like mine, but others are a little more abstract and you have to give it some thought to find a connection. - J.R. Boneka//

-----------------------
**Test 914-1901**
**Name:** Researcher Yuyuni Belopaku
**Date:** 24/02/2022
**Total Items:** Seven six-sided plastic dice labeled with dots, seven twenty-sided plastic dice labeled with Arabic numerals

**Input:** One six-sided dice, one twenty-sided dice
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** A pile of 21 dots and 20 numbers, and a plastic sphere

**Input:** One six-sided dice, one twenty-sided dice
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One eleven-sided dice and one fifteen-sided dice

**Input:** One six-sided dice, one twenty-sided dice
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A small vertical roulette wheel device with its wheel divided into eight sectors. Each sector is labeled with a number.

**Input:** One six-sided dice, one twenty-sided dice
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A large shape-shifting dice that, when thrown, has an approximately 10 in 13 chance to land as a twenty-sided dice and an approximately 3 in 13 chance to land as a six-sided dice.

**Input:** One six-sided dice, one twenty-sided dice
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A small rectangular device with a button. When the button is pressed, the flat surface of the device will form extrusions in the shape of seven-segment display, showing a random number between 1 and 20 and a random number between 1 and 6. A loud shrieking noise is emitted from the device during this process. The numbers last for approximately 10 minutes, or until the button is pressed again.

**Input:** One six-sided dice, one twenty-sided dice
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A large 26-sided dice labeled with numbers from 0 to 25. The result of throwing the dice seems to anomalously follow a binomial distribution with n=25 and p=0.5.

**Input:** One six-sided dice, one twenty-sided dice
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A thin plastic cylinder, with the words &#34;THE BEST DICE IN EXISTENCE&#34; engraved onto its side. Tossing the object onto a hard surface will cause it to loudly vocalize the word &#34;Ow!&#34; followed by a random number between 1 and 20 in a high-pitched voice. There is a small chance that this will be followed by the phrase &#34;Stop throwing me!&#34;.

-----------------------
**Test 914-1902**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Liz Hammond
**Date:** 25/02/2022
**Total Items:** Three pieces of jawbreaker candy, three x-shaped blender blades

**Input:** One jawbreaker candy, one blender blade
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One small knife made of flavored sugar, and one small metal sphere

**Input:** One jawbreaker candy, one blender blade
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A spinning top made of sugar and metal. It is anomalously able to keep itself spinning indefinitely once manually started. 

**Input:** One jawbreaker candy, one blender blade
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A large blender blade made of sugar, able to easily cut through soft materials. Any solid surface the blade has cut through will become anomalously &#39;flavored&#39;, with human subjects reporting various fruity tastes despite no flavoring substances being present. Effect wears off after 15 minutes.

-----------------------
**Test 914-1903**
**Name:** R. Carter Williams
**Date:** 25/02/2022
**Total Items:** Five snow globes

**Input:** One snow globe
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A snow globe, detached from the base. The base is severely dented and has been roughly cut into three pieces. Shaking the snow globe causes precipitation to fall from the sky in a 1.5-m radius around the globe. Once the globe is no longer actively being shaken, the precipitation ceases.

**Input:** One snow globe
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A sphere of glass filled with water, an unchanged base, and a pile of glitter. Heat is slowly transferred to the glitter from any surface the glitter is in direct contact with. Shaking the sphere of glass causes the water contained within to slowly freeze. Once the sphere is no longer being shaken, the contents quickly melt. The base shows no anomalous properties.

**Input:** One snow globe
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** Two small snow globes. One snow globe contains a model of a tropical beach, while the other contains a model of several carolers singing in front of a large snowman.

**Input:** One snow globe
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** A glass of water, a pile of glitter, and a cube of plastic. The plastic slowly cools anything within a 2-cm radius by up to 1 degree in total. Objects within this radius are also affected by an anomalous property that causes them to no longer absorb heat from their surroundings. The glass of water has the same effect, but heats objects instead of cooling them. Adding the glitter to the water caused it to stop exhibiting anomalous properties until the glitter was removed.

//Note: It appears that using the settings in the opposite order of the way it’s usually done caused the outputs to be “mixed up.” This could be a feature of 914, or it could be due to the fact that I usually test in the opposite order. - R. Carter Williams//

**Input:** One snow globe
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** A pile of glass and plastic shards. Glitter and water was dispersed throughout the output booth.

-----------------------
**Test 914-1904**
**Name:** Researcher Yuyuni Belopaku
**Date:** 27/02/2022
**Total Items:** --Six-- Five round blocks of rosin attached to pieces of cloth, for use in string instrument bows

**Input:** One block of rosin
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A clump of woven fiber attached to a thin plate of rosin

**Input:** One block of rosin
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A small bow made of rosin with cloth in place of the bow hair.

**Input:** One block of rosin
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A detailed rosin sculpture of a pine tree, on a felt pedestal

**Input:** One block of rosin
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Seven arrowheads made of rosin, and a long piece of string

//Note: Is this a &#34;bow&#34; pun? - Belopaku//

**Input:** One block of rosin
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A small animate rosin statue of a stylized elephant, standing on a piece of cloth. The statue left the output booth and began running around Researcher Belopaku before collapsing into a pile of rubble.

-----------------------
**Test 914-1905**
**Name:** Researcher Connolly, Junior Researcher Boneka
**Date:** 27/02/2022
**Total Items:** Three copies of the board game //Othello//

//Note: This is a two-player board game played on a 8 x 8 grid using 64 flat game pieces that are white on one side and black on the other. You play by alternating turns placing pieces on the board with your color facing up; any of the opponent&#39;s pieces that are in between your newly placed piece and an existing piece (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) are flipped over, which converts them to your own color. Whoever has the most pieces with their color facing up at the end of the game is the winner. - JR Boneka//

**Input:** One copy of //Othello//
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One altered board game, the lettering on the box indicating it to be titled //Othelloreo//. All the pieces have been modified so that they are layered black-white-black, rendering the game unplayable since they are now black on both sides.

**Input:** One copy of //Othello//
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One altered board game, the lettering on the box indicating it to be titled //Hamlet//. Notably, the rules for the game state that one side must take a minimum of fifteen minutes debating and agonizing over their decision before making a move, and that all parties lose regardless of the outcome.

**Input:** One copy of //Othello//
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One game board, two enlarged //Othello// game pieces. Testing reveals that when both of the pieces are placed on a flat surface, anything in between them is vertically flipped. Anomalous property was discovered when testing D-Class placed both pieces on each side of himself and was promptly overturned.

//Note: D-103821 was excused from testing and is currently being treated for minor head injuries in the infirmary. - JR Boneka//

-----------------------
**Test 914-1906**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Zevezda
**Date:** 10/03/2022
**Total Items:** One KS23 shotgun, one USB drive containing the game //Escape From Tarkov//, one remote control model of a M1A2 main battle tank, one USB drive containing the game //War Thunder//

**Input:** One shotgun and one USB drive containing //Escape From Tarkov//
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One KS23 with the USB drive integrated into the receiver. Further testing showed that when firing the shotgun, the user unconsciously aims at their own leg.

//Note: In// Escape From Tarkov //a strategy is to shoot enemies in their legs with shotguns. Apparently, 914 took that and my distaste for the game into account, creating this self-mutilation tool. - JR Zevezda//

**Input:** One tank model and one USB drive containing //War Thunder//
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One modified remote-control model of an M1A2 main battle tank, with the USB drive used to modify the components used to receive movement commands. Upon the opening of the output booth, the tank drove towards JR Zevezda. It was soon discovered that the tank was draining funds from JR Zevezda&#39;s bank account at a rate of $16/hour and sending them to the bank account of Gaijin Entertainment, the publishers of //War Thunder//. It is theorized that this was done by way of the modified movement command receiver. The transfer of money ceased after incineration. 

//Note:// War Thunder //has already taken enough of my money and time. I think this is a hint I need to find a less time-consuming hobby. - JR Zevezda//

-----------------------
**Test 914-1907**
**Name:** Dr. Ari Marlon
**Date:** 16/03/2022
**Total Items:** One grogger, one copy of //Megillah Esther//
 
//Note: Purim starts tonight, so I thought I&#39;d use a grogger and// Megillah Esther //for a holiday themed test. Purim is a Jewish holiday in which we read// The Book of Esther //also known as// Megillah Esther. //A grogger is a noisemaker used during the reading of// Megillah Esther. //- Dr. Marlon//
 
**Input:** One copy of //Megillah Esther//
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One copy of the //Book of Ruth//
 
//Note: The// Book of Ruth //is a book in the Bible. - Dr. Marlon//
 
**Input:** One grogger
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One grogger that activates with mention of any form of dessert food within a four meter radius. When activated, the grogger makes a loud ringing sound that produces feelings of disgust.

-----------------------
**Test 914-1908**
**Name:** Dr. Arin Martinez, Junior Researcher Milan Dzudak
**Date:** 17/03/2022
**Total Items:** Five acoustic guitars manufactured by //C.F. Martin &amp; Co.//

**Input:** One acoustic guitar
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** Several piles of crushed Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and Brazilian rosewood (Dalbergia nigra) fragments, a small pile of steel wire fragments of varying length and thickness.

**Input:** One acoustic guitar
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** An acoustic guitar with the strings removed, six coiled steel guitar strings.

**Input:** One acoustic guitar
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** An acoustic guitar manufactured by //Taylor Guitars//.

**Input:** One acoustic guitar
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A small hammered dulcimer, a pair of small wooden mallets. When the mallets are held, the person holding them is anomalously able to play the instrument at an intermediate level, even if they have never played a hammered dulcimer previously.

**Input:** One acoustic guitar
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** An acoustic guitar of unknown manufacture. Markings on the headstock do not correlate to any known language or maker&#39;s mark. When played, the item eminates a strong antimemetic field around the player, rendering them unnoticed by those not on a regimen of Class-W mnestics. Any sounds made by the instrument are also subject to this antimemetic effect. The field dissipates almost immediately upon interruption of play.

-----------------------
**Test 914-1909**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Zen
**Date:** 31/03/2022
**Total Items:** Three metal models of the &#34;Hidden Blade&#34; from the videogame //Assassin&#39;s Creed II//

//Note: For the record, it&#39;s a gauntlet with a blade on the wrist that swipes in and out while moving the fingers. This model is for cosplays and has a dull blade for safety. - Junior Researcher Zen//

**Input:** One Hidden Blade
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One Hidden Blade similar to the one appearing in //Assassin&#39;s Creed//, the first game of the series, which features a slightly different design.

**Input:** One Hidden Blade
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One Hidden Blade similar to the one appearing in //Assassin&#39;s Creed III//, more complex than the previous ones, being a knife that comes out and rotates to get in the user&#39;s hand. However, this copy was sharper and harder to handle, and a tester lost two fingers while using it.

**Input:** One Hidden Blade
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One fully operational rope launcher actioned by an internal spring system, externally similar to the one appearing in //Assassin&#39;s Creed: Syndicate//, another game of the series. However, the rope, measuring only 10 m, was too thin to hold a human body and broke soon after the beginning of the testing.

**Total Items:** Three small plastic trash bins, six metal bottle caps

**Input:** One trash bin, two bottle caps
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A large plastic hat with the appearance of a straw hat, and two small metal models of a plastic bag full of trash

**Input:** One trash bin, two bottle caps
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A large opaque plastic bottle with the appearance of a glass bottle, with a large metal cap. The bottle is empty, but human subjects will be led to hallucinate that the bottle is filled with various articles of trash when observing the inside of the object from the mouth of the bottle.

**Input:** One trash bin, two bottle caps
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** An unchanged bin, with the unchanged bottlecaps attached to each side of the lid. The object appears to be animate and capable of speech. It vocalizes from an unknown source inside its body, but its lid moves up and down when it speaks, mimicking the movements of a mouth. It declared itself to be a &#39;&#39;trash monster&#39;&#39; and threatened to devour Hammond despite being stationary and harmless, which it vehemently denied. Put into soundproof container, and became inert after 2 hours.

**Output:** One complete set of //The Legend of Korra//

**Input:** One complete set of //ATLA//
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A blue plastic tablet with a cognitohazardous symbol written on it that causes viewers to believe they can &#34;bend&#34; one of the classical elements by telekinetically controlling it or, in the case of fire, spontaneously generating it for approximately five hours, with no discovered way to halt its effects. Which element is assigned appears to be connected to the viewer&#39;s personality. Incinerated.

**Input:** One complete set of //ATLA//
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A twenty-seven centimetre tall replica of series protagonist Aang, with eyes and tattoos marked in the reflective material on the bottom of the disc. When picked up by D-80764, output became animate and attacked with various forms of &#34;bending&#34;, including spontaneous fire generation, apparent geokinesis and hydrokinesis, and wind generation. Subdued and smashed by security personnel after causing heavy damage to test chamber. D-80764 and Junior Researcher Elwin sent to medical bay for second-degree burns and a broken forearm, respectively. Remains incinerated.

//Note: I&#39;ll pay for the test chamber repairs. - JR Elwin//

**Name:** Junior Researcher Evangeline Perry
**Date:** 22/04/2022
**Total Items:** Three bottles of the perfume //Avril Lavigne Forbidden Rose//

**Input:** One bottle of the perfume //Avril Lavigne Forbidden Rose//
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One bottle of the perfume //Avril Lavigne Black Star// 

**Input:** One bottle of the perfume //Avril Lavigne Forbidden Rose//
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One bottle of the perfume //Avril Lavigne Forbidden Rose//. The perfume had a considerably more powerful smell but dissipated very quickly in turn.

**Input:** One bottle of the perfume //Avril Lavigne Forbidden Rose//
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A bottle with a similar appearance. When applying the perfume to a D-Class, the D-Class showed notable changes in their behavior, acting like a stereotypical &#39;&#39;emo&#39;&#39; teenager, adopting a sulking and negative demeanor, who was unable to stop singing the song &#39;&#39;Sk8er Boi&#39;&#39; by Avril Lavigne.

//Note: It stopped eventually, but we&#39;re unsure if it happened naturally or because the D-Class passed out from exhaustion after a while. - J.R. Perry//
