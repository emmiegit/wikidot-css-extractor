I climb up to the edge, and pull myself over to the next space.  I really wish I could have studied more, there&#39;s so much here I don&#39;t understand.  

     Quiet, now I&#39;m used to that.  Most of the time, I hear nothing, although I do get a bit of ambiance in some of the spaces I step into.  But even then, those few noises only serve to accentuate the soundless depths.  It&#39;s been too quiet for too long, and no one has said or done anything to me ever since the lights went out.  

     God, I&#39;ve no idea how long it&#39;s been, time&#39;s just been meaningless, really.  I don&#39;t sleep, I don&#39;t eat, although I can taste things when given a chance.  All I know is what they let me know, really, and part of me wonders if this is another one of their damned games.  I do know they were pissed when I found out what was really going on the first time, but for whatever reason, they decided against terminating me.  Small favors. 

     I guess I should be thankful, though, but I do wonder whether there&#39;s any point to my current existence.  Dr. Nguyen says that there&#39;s always a point for existence, but he&#39;s out there and I&#39;m stuck here.  A series of infinite planes, all alike.  A grue would be welcome.

     No, this one&#39;s different, I can see that.  I walk over to view the plane, and the Words make themselves readily apparently.  I read them silently, trying to figure out what it all means.  

     “SCP-001 has left its location. The Gate is Open.”  Gate?  What gate?  What the fuck?  I continue to read the report, and phrases like “XK-Class” and “Patros-Omega” come up, but “end of the world scenario” is pretty damned clear.  

      Either this is really some elaborate game done by the Foundation, or I am well and truly alone.  I can&#39;t escape, I can&#39;t kill myself, I&#39;m just going slightly mad.  I giggle at the thought that I managed to miss out on Judgement Day, and now I find myself in an ironic hell.  

     Fuck, Cassy, what do I do now?
