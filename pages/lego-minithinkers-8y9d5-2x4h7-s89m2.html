||||||||~ Initial Report||
||~ Author || Teodor Nordskov ||~ Date || February 08, 1979||
||~ Interest||Low||~ Identifier||Lego MiniThinkers||
||||||||Items were discovered after the sub rosa corporate takeover which was managed under orders from Mr. Carter. Upon review of the company&#39;s inventory, the items and their properties were discovered. Previously, Lego A/S had been automatically neutralizing the items via placement in large tubs of water for 1 hour and selling the unremarkable variant. Practice continues due to inexpensive bulk supply and the supplier&#39;s insistence on only providing the current version of the items. ||

||||||||~ Memo 01||
||||||||~ 8Y9D5/2X4H7/S89M2 ||
||~ Sender || Anthony Young ||~ Recipient || Teodor Nordskov||
|||||||| Concerning the attempted return of the items by Angelina Baar. _
 _
While her request was denied, I fear that we may have lost one of our more reliable customers. Specifically, she expressed concerns over the actions of the items as time progressed. _
 _
According to her written complaint, she&#39;s upset about the items participating in &#34;miniature lynch mobs and general barbarism&#34;. I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll be buying anything else in the foreseeable future - not until this is resolved, at least.||
