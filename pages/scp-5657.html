**Special Containment Procedures:** If you are viewing this document, you have already cleared all procedures required to access Section-ØN.

All essential operations within Section-ØN will be overseen by Site AI //EVAS//. Internal security protocols may only be revised / updated by O5 Executive Order, and only after a full Council screening via the //Knows Test//. 

If an individual undergoes the //Knows Test// and SCP-5657 does not give the code-phrase &#34;I can feel their heart beating&#34;, automated restraints will keep the individual fully immobilized. Should immobilization fail, or the individual poses any eminent threat to SCP-5657&#39;s safety, they will be terminated via automatic gunfire. Secondary to SCP-5657&#39;s survival, the live capture of a GOI-115 specimen is considered paramount in averting a total SK-Class &#34;Dominance Shift&#34; scenario.

SCP-5657, together with all knowledge related to its existence, has been permanently restricted to Section-ØN.  Upon exiting this area, you will be amnesticized.

**Description:** SCP-5657 is Nikita Ludo, a television personality from Jacksonville, Florida, U.S.A.

From 1995 to 1997 Ms. Ludo hosted //Nicki Knows//, a daytime talk-show formatted to resemble a therapy session. This hour-long program would feature weekly celebrity guests, each recounting childhood experiences and future aspirations in front of Ms. Ludo and a live studio audience. Unlike typical therapy, Ms. Ludo would often criticize and berate her guests to the delight of her audience, revealing any lies or hidden details told throughout the interview with seemingly (and now proven) supernatural accuracy. 

SCP-5657 is capable of C2M minor empathic communication, i.e. the extrasensory perception of emotions through physical contact. Under ordinary circumstances, SCP-5657 would only require Grade-D passive surveillance. However, SCP-5657 must remain within Section-ØN at all times, having become the target of a newly discovered group of human-mimicking lifeforms — GOI-115 — hereafter known as &#34;Smiling Men&#34;.

The total population, objectives, and anomalous capabilities of the &#34;Smiling Men&#34; is currently unknown. However, to date, this group has carried out 26 near-successful assassination attempts on SCP-5657. These breach events continue to occur wherever SCP-5657 is relocated, and against all escalating containment protocols; the most recent attempt being carried out via an undetected form of micro-explosive implanted in the tear-duct of Security Officer Wills. As a direct result, SCP-5657 has been left with 3^^rd^^ degree burns on 32% of their epidermis, and partial loss of lower-body mobility. 

Until testing is complete, SCP-5657&#39;s survival is considered paramount, as currently they are the only known means of detecting &#34;Smiling Men&#34;.

&gt; **SCP-5657:** The show wasn&#39;t always like that, you know. Did you see the first season? Back when it was called //The Healing Hour with Dr. Ludo//? That&#39;s how it was supposed to be. That&#39;s how the producers pitched it to me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Adelard:** So did they—
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** And the audience, the cameras — it didn&#39;t really matter; it was all about helping people. That&#39;s all I&#39;ve ever wanted to do, you know. It&#39;s why I became a therapist. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Adelard:** Yes, but did the producers—
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** I mean— alright, yes, I liked the attention, and meeting celebrities was a bit of a thrill — and I obviously have a mild case of histrionic personality disorder, but what else do you expect from the &#34;weird witch girl&#34; out of trailer-park-nowhere-Jacksonville finally getting some positive goddam reinforcement for once in her— 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Adelard:** Ms. Ludo.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** Hm?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Adelard:** Would you mind answering my question?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** Yes, sorry — what question was that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Adelard:** Were the producers aware of your empathic abilities?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** Oh. No, they just knew me from reputation.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Adelard:** As a kind of human therapy dog? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** No, I— excuse me!? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Adelard:** Technically speaking, I mean; that is what you did for money before and after dropping out of college, right? You assisted people in finding pleasurable feelings, which you did through physical contact. Would a more apt comparison be to pr—
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** Wow— okay— for starters, I was an &#34;emotional guide&#34;, thank you very much — and I didn&#39;t drop out! I just took a few years off to work! I really was going to go back and finish my degree, but school was expensive, and over time my side-gig had attracted some wealthy... patrons. Then they introduced me to Vic and Trism, who pitched me their //Inside the Mind// show— 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Adelard:** You mean //The Healing Hour//.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** I-... sorry, what did I say?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Adelard:** The truth. We&#39;ve already spoken to the entire cast and crew, Ms. Ludo. We know the original show was a generic television psychic program, but then you manipulated—
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** I didn&#39;t—!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Adelard:** Interview 5657-POI-093, Trism G. Cavalish — quote, &#34;I was just humoring her at first, y&#39;know, with her whole &#39;Healing Hour&#39; thing. Then she reached out and held my hand. Suddenly we were talking about my father, and all the ways I keep trying to live up to his impossible damn expectations... It took a few hours, but she convinced me.&#34; End quote. So, you used your abilities to rifle through this man&#39;s emotions, made him vulnerable, then coerced him into producing your show. Is that correct?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** That&#39;s not—... that&#39;s not even how it works... 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Adelard:** How does it work, Nicki? For the record.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** Well it&#39;s //difficult//, since you asked. It&#39;s... imagine touching someone, and suddenly a symphony starts playing — or death metal — or free-form jazz. Imagine you look at them, and there&#39;s a whole extra dimension of color and size, folding in and spilling of their skin like a melting technicolor silhouette — and it&#39;s doing interpretive dance to that music from before. Imagine, Doctor, trying to figure out what all //that// is supposed to mean, all while your own skin feels like it&#39;s on fire, or rotting, or suddenly jolting with overwhelming pleasure. Emotions don&#39;t just parade themselves around, telling you exactly what they are like Snow White&#39;s goddamn dwarfs! Everyone has a totally different frequency! Some people have shame tangled up in pleasure. Some people mix joy with fear. Some people have anxious, overwhelmed and spiraling out of control as their //normal// — like they&#39;re spinning fifteen barb-wire plates covered in burning tarantulas and that&#39;s //fine// somehow! And—
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Adelard:** Nicki, mechanically speaking, you still just read people&#39;s emotions and use that information to influence them, correct? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:**: //(...)// You&#39;re making it sound like some... parlor trick. I&#39;ve spent my whole life learning to live with—... learning how to control my abilities. It took me years to accept they were even //real//. No one else believed me. Growing up I thought

&gt; **Interview Log 5657-09**
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer: Level 4 Researcher | Dr. Malcolm Adelard**
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewee: SCP-5657 | Nikita Ludo**
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** I loved //The Healing Hour//. People didn&#39;t. Ratings were low, reviews called it &#34;softball feel-good garbage&#34;. There was talk of canceling. I mean—... no one said it out loud, but when I shook the producers&#39; hands—
&gt; 
&gt;  **Dr. Adelard:** They changed their minds after episode 18, correct?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** //(...)// Yeah, after the Doherty interview; after my little... outburst.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Adelard:** Was Ms. Doherty one of the—
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** No, no no no. She was human — by the barest margin. God, I&#39;d never felt such //loathing// before. She felt it for everyone, literally everyone — me, the audience, the crew — we were all beneath her. She was like a reverse pin-cushion.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Adelard:** Come again?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** It&#39;s—... God, it&#39;s so weird being able to just talk about this. So, when a person is more empathetic, their color — their //aura// I suppose — looks a bit like a pin cushion; little tendrils of light reaching out to everyone in the room. That woman though—... ugh! It wouldn&#39;t have been so bad if she was //honest// about it. Instead, she wore this big fake smile and told me she was so //happy// to be on my show — which was such bullshit. So, yeah! I called her out on it! Loudly, and in front of a live studio audience... not to mention 3 producers who looked //extremely// ready to fire me for rapid-fire-insulting Shannen goddam Doherty.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Adelard:** But instead, they gave you a second season.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** They gave me a whole new //show// is what they did! How could they not when the ratings exploded like that?  Everyone was talking about it! I was on the cover of //TV Guide//, //People// magazine, even—
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Adelard:** I thought it was all about helping people, Nicki.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** That—... I was just saying that—
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Adelard:** //Nicki Knows// was more popular though, wasn&#39;t it? All you had to do was help them find some confidence, ease their anxieties, make them feel safe — and suddenly your celebrity guests are sharing all their deepest, darkest secrets for everyone to laugh at. Now that&#39;s a much better show — or, at least, a better circus—
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** You don&#39;t need to do that, you know.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Adelard:** //(...)// Pardon me?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** You keep provoking me so I&#39;ll argue. I get it. People don&#39;t like spilling their guts, but they love correcting people they&#39;re angry at. It&#39;s an old tactic, but it works. Despite what you people //feel// about me, I&#39;m not just my ability. I know how this works. I made a //living// off this.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Adelard:** Ms. Ludo— 
&gt;   
&gt; **SCP-5657:** You&#39;re supposed to apologize afterwards, by the way. Reconcile. Build a rapport. Then, all those heightened emotions will become associated with intimacy instead of animosity, and your interviewee opens right up... though, I guess this isn&#39;t a talk show interview, or a therapy session, is it? You&#39;re just collecting data from an asset. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Adelard:** Data we need to protect you, and the rest of the world, Ms. Ludo.
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-5657:** Which I get. Look, I can&#39;t say much for the accommodations, but I&#39;d much rather be on this side of the blast-doors than out there with... //them//. I&#39;m on your side. You want to know something? Quit pulling my strings like a baby with a banjo and just //talk to me//.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Adelard:** //(...)// So, season 2. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** Yeah, Season 2. Like you said, I&#39;d invite on a celebrity guest, hold their hand, listen to them lie for 10 minutes, then spend another 10 tearing them completely apart; and yeah, the audience loved it. Tears. Laughter. Screaming. Our security guys worked harder than Jerry Springer&#39;s, not to mention the censors. We made it 28 glorious episodes until—... until //it// walked on stage—
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Adelard:** It? You mean Governor Ma—
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** That //thing//. Yes.

Along the way though — God, I was so paranoid then — but everywhere I went these black cars kept following me through every turn. One night they even tried to box me in, run me off the road! I kept speeding up, taking sudden exits, heading further East when I wanted to go South. I didn&#39;t stop for 72 straight hours; not until I hit Texas, and the border. Once I was finally across I pulled into this little motel and... well, you know what happened then.

&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** //(sighs)// So, I paid for my motel room in cash, and I was standing over the bed so damn ready to pass out... but then my stomach reminded me it&#39;d also been 72 hours since I //ate//. So, I went to get a quick vending machine lunch. 20 seconds, tops. When I got back with my Cheetos he was just... there. In my room. Standing. Smiling. I didn&#39;t even have time to scream before his hands were around my throat. He didn&#39;t even squeeze; he just pressed his palms in like a bear trap, crushing my windpipe. Then everything went black.
&gt; 
&gt; //2-second pause.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** I&#39;d felt a lot of things in my life, Doc, but dying... I didn&#39;t know terror and calm could exist together like that. There&#39;s no feeling like it. 
&gt; 
&gt; //4-second pause.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** But then, out of nowhere he just... let me go. I was on the floor, gasping, coughing, this god awful ringing building in my ears. I could barely see, but when I looked up at him... Doc, he was //crying//. Not just crying, but screaming, clawing at his neck, trembling like a scared puppy. I didn&#39;t know what was happening at first, but after I got a bit more oxygen to my brain I realized: //I// was crying. //I// was terrified, and hopeless, and dying... and without knowing it, I&#39;d somehow forced those feelings onto him.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Adelard:** That-... Ms. Ludo, are you saying you can //transmit// your emotions to other people? None of our testing—
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** No. Not people. I&#39;ve... well, sometimes, I feel like I can almost share a little piece of what I&#39;m feeling with someone I&#39;m—... really intimate with.

&gt; **Dr. Adelard:** You mean—
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** I don&#39;t mean that, no. I mean emotionally intimate. Someone I&#39;m in sync with, someone I trust... but no. Like I said before, people are just too different — too full and complex. Trying to impart my feelings onto someone else would be like... trying to add a spark to a bonfire. But that //thing// had no fire — no anything. Suddenly I was adding that spark to a dry pine bed. Fwoosh!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Adelard:** Incredible. I&#39;m curious, though: why didn&#39;t you take your chance to run?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** Because I decided to hit him with a goddamn chair instead. He&#39;d tried to kill me, Doc. I was running on pure instinct. I&#39;d been cornered, exhausted, and terrified. My brain switched from flight to fight. I just screamed and started swinging. I broke his back, his arm, and his nose with that damned chair. He didn&#39;t even flinch. He just kept trying to get back up. The only thing that seemed to hurt him was when I grabbed his face and gave him another dose of //fear.//
&gt; 
&gt; //5657 takes a deep breath.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** It worked... for a while. Maybe I was losing focus, maybe I just wasn&#39;t scared enough... maybe he was getting used to it. I don&#39;t know; but he got back on his feet. I had to do something. I grabbed him one last time and gave him the only thing I had left... anger. That&#39;s when he started hitting me. He could have killed me — easily — but he didn&#39;t. He just hit me, over and over. You&#39;ve probably seen the medical reports. I&#39;d never even broken a bone before that day, let alone twenty-freaking-seven. It worked, though. I stayed alive long enough for your SWAT guys to show up. You know the rest.
&gt; 
&gt;  **Dr. Adelard:** I do, yes. Thank you Nicki. Let&#39;s stop here.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** Oh— yeah alright. That&#39;s... hey— hey Doc? Do you think... are you guys close? I just mean... you&#39;ve taken a whole lotta&#39; my blood and bone marrow and— I don&#39;t even know. Have you found a way to—?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Adelard:** Don&#39;t worry, Ms. Ludo. I think we&#39;re very close to a breakthrough. You&#39;ll be out of here in no time.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** //(...)// Shake on it?

**Access granted. Please enter the Containment Cell.**.

&gt; **SCP-5657:** S-stay—... wh—... what? What are you...
&gt; 
&gt; **USER_NOT_FOUND:** We always thought a smile was just a curve of the lips. We thought that&#39;s all there was to it. We played all your little social games, said all the right words, and we //smiled.// So simple. So easy. But then we met you.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5657:** H-how—!? How are you even here!? We&#39;re under a goddam mountain!
&gt; 
&gt; **USER_NOT_FOUND:** Oh, the same reason as always, Nicki. The human element. Our mutual friend Dr. Adelard knew there was no making another Nicki; not after decades of tests, decades of protecting you at cost. Then we took someone he was close to. Wills, I believe his name was. So we cut a deal. Armistice, for you.
&gt;

&gt; **USER_NOT_FOUND:** Come along now, Nicki. You&#39;re going to teach us how to feel.

&gt; **USER_NOT_FOUND:** What—... What is this?
&gt; 
&gt; **Nicki:** Holographics. Pretty cool, right? Technology has come crazy far since I was broadcasting to CRTs... or, sorry, did you mean generally? Well then, this is a trap.
&gt; 
&gt; //USER_NOT_FOUND spins on heel, staring at all four corners of the room. Their expression is deadpan, but their body language shows visible signs of panic.//

&gt; **USER_NOT_FOUND:** No. No, you touched my wrist. This is //your// cell. You were //here//. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Nicki:** Keyword being &#34;were&#34;. You&#39;re right though, this was my cell. I hadn&#39;t left it in 20 years — not until tonight.
&gt; 
&gt; **USER_NOT_FOUND:** //(...)// You planned this.
&gt; 
&gt; **Nicki:** No ███, Smiley. They moved me out the secret side-door nearly 20 minutes ago; right after I gave you an extra big dose of //curiosity//. Honestly, we only needed you idle for, like, 15 seconds — but you kept flipping through files. I outdid myself!
&gt; 
&gt; **USER_NOT_FOUND:** This can&#39;t—... Adelard—
&gt; 
&gt; **Nicki:** Played you. I played you. Even the AI played you. Ain&#39;t that right, //EVAS//?

&gt; **Nicki:** Nonsense. You clearly missed your calling as an actor, //EVAS//. But, I guess you&#39;ll have to settle for being this thing&#39;s warden.

&gt; //USER_NOT_FOUND begins pacing, frantically, before reaching up for their own throat.//

&gt; **Nicki:** Hey, now, none of that. See those panels on the wall? Tell &#39;im what&#39;s behind them, Doc.
&gt; 
&gt; **Intercom | Dr. Adelard:** Congelation cannons. High-pressure foam spray that hardens to 3000 kilograms per cubic meter in .002 seconds from contact.

&gt; //The holographic projection of Nicki Ludo stands, with difficulty. The damaged portions of her left leg are supplemented by a robotic knee-brace. She brushes herself off, and walks directly up to USER_NOT_FOUND, looking them in the eye.//
