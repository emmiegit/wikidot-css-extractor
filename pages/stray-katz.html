##489316|[[size large]]**Interview Log:**[[/size]]##

Location: Site 46
Date: 5 September 2018
Interviewer: Sheldon Katz, Esq. (Sr. Counsel)
Subject: SCP-4799-1

&gt; //[BEGIN LOG]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Katz**:  //[aside]// Is this window one-way or two-way?
&gt; 
&gt; **Technician**: One-way right now.  Touch the green button to switch to two-way if you want to.  No, the other green button.
&gt; 
&gt; **Katz**: Is the AV set up?  Can it, uh, hear me?  I usually have them activate the comm link before I come in, so I don’t have to screw around with... //[inaudible]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4799-1**: You guys need a moment? I’m not going anywhere.
&gt; 
&gt; **Katz**: //[inaudible]//  Uh, no.  We’re good.  Can you see me?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4799-1**:  No.  You have me looking at the reflective side of a one-way mirror.
&gt; 
&gt; **Katz**: //[clicking sound]// That better?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4799-1**: Well, I can see you now, but I wouldn’t call that an improvement.  I mean, look at you.  Have you been sleeping in that suit for the last week?
&gt; 
&gt; **Katz**: //[long pause]//.  I’m Sheldon Katz.  I’m an attorney.  I’m, uh, looking at the parameters of your containment at this facility.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4799-1**: My lawyer, huh?   Glad that Tort[[footnote]]Reference is to entity provisionally designated SCP-4799-4, an associate of SCP-4799-1.[[/footnote]] came through, but from the looks of it he must have seen your ad on the side of a bus shelter somewhere.  When do I get out?
&gt; 
&gt; **Katz**: Sooner than you might expect.  That collar you’re wearing.  Is that a dog thing?[[footnote]] SCP-4799-1 is a humanoid life form the cranial anatomy of which is superficially canine in form. [[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4799-1**: Fuck you, you fat sloppy bigot.
&gt; 
&gt; **Katz**: Serious question.  The, um, file doesn’t say.  What does the collar signify?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4799-1**: It’s not mine.   It’s a GOC kill collar.  My guys disabled it but I couldn’t get it off before the Foundation caught me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Katz**: Um, okay.  Hold on, just making a note.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4799-1**:   Don’t I get a phone call or something?
&gt; 
&gt; **Katz**: That’s not how this works.  So, um, three days before the Foundation had bagged and tagged you, your crew busted you out of GOC Area-22?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4799-1**:   Yeah.
&gt; 
&gt; **Katz**: And how did the GOC manage to catch you in the first place?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4799-1**:   They fucking cheated.  Some kind of knock-out gas while we were in Cupertino.
&gt; 
&gt; **Katz**: And when your crew broke you out, did you also recover all of your personal effects?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4799-1**:   No, they took my transformer and I didn’t get it back... but... I can probably make another one.  What&#39;s atomic number 43 on the periodic table in this universe?
&gt; 
&gt; **Katz** This transformer you&#39;re referring to.  Look at the screen on the left.  No, my left, your right.  Are you referring to the object in the photograph?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4799-1**: Yeah, that&#39;s my rig.  By the way, isn’t this the universe where they’re supposed to read me my rights or something?
&gt; 
&gt; **Katz**: //[Aside, to technician]// We’re done here.  How do you turn this off?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4799-1**:   Are you listening to me?  Do I get to post bail or something?  I have the worst fucking lawyer.
&gt; 
&gt; **Katz**:  Um, Shock?  That&#39;s your name, if I read the file correctly?  Um, I said I’m //a// lawyer.  I’m not //your// lawyer.
&gt; 
&gt; //[INTERVIEW ENDS]//

Sheldon withdrew his left thumb from his computer&#39;s blood oath certification dongle, then reached into a drawer to grab a tissue and press it against the bleeding pinprick on the tip of his thumb.  Someday they&#39;d get around to inventing a more sanitary way of encouraging Foundation personnel and their counterparties to observe contracts.

Road trip tomorrow.
