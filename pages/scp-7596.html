SCP-7596.
[[/div]]
[[/div]]

-----

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to an ongoing investigation, SCP-7596 and the area surrounding it are to remain in situ. Following the completion of this investigation, the damaged infrastructure of Site-322 will be repaired, and SCP-7596 will be placed in a large vacuum chamber for further study and testing.

Site-322 personnel are being subpoenaed by a joint commission composed of Ethics Committee and Decommissioning Department upper-level staff. Failure to respond to meeting requests and interviews will be met with disciplinary action.

**Description:** SCP-7596 is a stable singularity, roughly 4 meters in diameter, floating in an artificial cavern below Site-322. Foreign material that passes through SCP-7596&#39;s event horizon undergoes a spaghettification process, then vanishes into the singularity and becomes unrecoverable. SCP-7596 poses no known danger of expanding.

Floating inside SCP-7596 are eight bodies in a state of suspended animation, all wearing Foundation uniforms. Efforts to identify them are presently underway.

SCP-7596 is situated in Basement Level 34 of Site-322. An unknown series of events led to the destruction of this area, likely due to a tremendous release of force. Further information regarding its creation is currently unknown. The ongoing investigation has been divided between the Foundation&#39;s Decommissioning Department and The Ethics Committee.

[[/div]]

The above file was created by Director Calvin Bold and Doctor Jeremiah Cimmerian (EC-1) for the purposes of the SCP-7596 investigation, and has been distributed to all relevant parties. Below is the timeline of events that led to the creation of SCP-7596.

= [[size 140%]]**TIMELINE** [[/size]]

[[size 130%]]**The Applied Paratechnology Department** [[/size]]

In compliance with a directive issued by the Overseer Council, Site-322 was assigned limited authority over the Foundation&#39;s vast array of paratechnology, designated the Applied Paratechnology Section. Director Lague placed the department under the guidance of Doctor Anthony Coix.

Members of the Overseer Council, Site-322 Director Paul Lague, and a select group of 9 personnel who were specifically designated to work within the Applied Paratechnology Section were given clearance.

= **PORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM THE ETHICS COMMITTEE’S INTERVIEW WITH DOCTOR ANTHONY S. COIX**
-----
**EC-1:** What do you do, Coix? Lague has you here as ‘Co-Site Director’. That’s not an official position.

**Coix:** O-Oh, well, It’s a… (//gestures//) personal relationship. If you, uh, read a little bit further down you’ll see I supervise the Research board and—

**EC-1:** You’re the head of research?

**Coix:** Ah, my bad— sir. I’m the Chair for the Applied Paratech Section.

**EC-1:** Anything in your background qualify you for that role, Coix?

**Coix:** An amplitude of introductory engineering classes in my 20s, uh, over 15 years of experience overseeing Foundation projects, and an eye for picking the best and brightest.

**EC-1:** You’re a middle manager, Coix?

**Coix:** Project management and organization would be my specialty, sir. Regardless of the… ideological reception to Director Lague’s Integration Program, the Overseers wanted his directorial oversight on their projects. We had options; Applied Paratech seemed the most promising. And ethical, sir.

**EC-1:** So they wanted Lague for this and got you?

**Coix:** He’s a very busy man.

**EC-1:** This department focuses on… (//Adjusts glasses//) “maintaining a modest database of paratechnology potentially useful to the Foundation. How it works, what it’s made of, what it does, and then sending it back to whatever Site it came from.”

**Coix:** That was our initial department focus. The Council demanded changes in exchange for leniency on the Integration Program.

**EC-1:** What does that mean?

**Coix:** Okay, so, Skunk Works was a laboratory at DARPA that was--

**EC-1:** No, technical archive.

 **Coix:** Oh. Well, we were more interested in recording interesting applications of paratechnology. Eigenweapons, physics-defiant mechanisms, anomalous computer viruses -- after the whole [[[SCP-7525-EX]]] thing, RAISA got on the Council&#39;s ass about keeping track of these things, which meant that Council got on //our// ass about it. But they were adamant that our primary goal was to assist the security of the Foundation. Whatever that meant was up to them. Now ethically, I tried to—

**Coix:** I, well, we—

**EC-1:** Then stop blaming everyone else and play some goddamn ball.

The Applied Paratechnology Section was assigned the crucial task of procuring valuable research and items to benefit the Foundation&#39;s operations. Despite the department&#39;s significant contribution to the Foundation, little was known about the full extent of its operations before the SCP-7596 investigation. It remains unclear if any of the Applied Paratechnology Section&#39;s research had been applied prior to the SCP-7596 incident. With the aid of the Records and Information Security Administration (RAISA), sealed files pertaining to a top-secret project called &#34;Isadore&#34; were eventually unearthed, uncovering a wealth of previously undisclosed information.

[[size 130%]]**Project Isadore** [[/size]]

Project Isadore was a highly significant research endeavor that involved the entire team of the Applied Paratechnology Section, earning a reputation among the staff as a capital project.

Prior to Isadore’s execution, the Overseer Council had been aggressively advocating for all Foundation data to be transferred to Site-7&#39;s pocket dimension storage servers. Numerous Sites had yet to make substantial progress on the data transfers.

Despite the initial confidence placed in Site-7&#39;s pocket dimension storage, a number of issues were later identified. The most pressing issue was the occurrence of data corruption when attempting to transfer large quantities of information through the semistabilized Y-class dimensional gate. The resulting consequences ranged from file deletion to data corruption to the occurrence of inexplicable blackouts.

The overarching goal of Project Isadore was to design an interdimensional file transfer system that could be deemed indestructible. In the context of the project, &#34;indestructible&#34; was defined by the staff as a system that was self-repairing, self-updating, and impervious to all forms of external attack.

**EC-1:** You were Isadore staff?

**Davis:** Yes, sir. I was responsible for heading the development side of the project.

**EC-1:** Anything else?

**Davis:** Right, sorry. I— We get project requests sent based on levels of demand, I guess. 5 being pertinent and 1 being whenever, basically. Isadore was a 6. The hardware package we made was built with a monitor sourced from, uh, a digital terrorist. Gamers Against Weed, if I remember correctly. They used it for data storage, something like 500 petabytes. God knows what for, but it was what we had lying around.

**EC-1:** And this is the monitor Chairman Coix said was… “slapped together”?

**Davis:** Are you kidding? We didn’t have a quarter of the time we needed. We’re lucky it was “slapped together” at all. We put it into this empty steel frame where we hooked server connection ports, Internet and Bluetooth connectivity, and a perpetual generator from the Paratech archive. Again, it was a mess, but Coix set the deadlines.

**EC-1:** And you spoke for your team.

**Davis:** Look, I tried to get my men on schedule as best as I could. I told him we needed more time, but there’s only so many times you can say something here before you’re on the other side of the door.

**EC-1:** If Coix wasn’t listening, then why not communicate these concerns to the Council, Davis?

**Davis:** Because that was Coix’s job.

(//EC-1 sighs, and continues typing.//)

**EC-1:** So it worked. This device.

**Davis:** //[...]// For a time, it did. Jones wanted to inspect it before she let us hook it up to RAISA’s hardware. So — uh, we brought it into the pocket dimension for a test run.

On May 24, 2023, Project Isadore was completed on schedule and transported to Site-7&#39;s pocket dimension. Maria Jones, the director of RAISA and Site-7, was granted authorization to test the Isadore machine on a secured test server.

**Coix:** They, uh, forgot that transporting a large amount of data into Site-7 led to corruption. This thing had 5000 terabytes of test files on it.

**EC-1:** What do you mean, “forgot”?

**Coix:** Well, they— I mean, we had an experimental coating around the server that had been used in previous data transfer tests with great success.

As SCP-7596-1, the monitor containing data, was linked to a power source and the quarantined server, it booted as expected. Researcher James Davis then initiated a command for data upload. However, Site-7 immediately experienced a power outage while SCP-7596-1 generated immense amounts of heat and vibrated violently. As a result, the server connected to SCP-7596-1 exploded, prompting Isadore personnel to quickly remove it from the power source, which temporarily resolved the issue.

Suddenly, SCP-7596-1, which lacked a built-in power supply, unexpectedly booted and displayed a message on its CRT monitor that read, &#34;I MUST SELF-DESTRUCT [sic].&#34; Attempts to investigate the machine&#39;s steel frame proved futile as all tools were rendered ineffective.

Director Paul Lague became involved in this case following SCP-7596-1&#39;s newly gained anomalous phenomena, despite being initially skeptical about his ability to assist Applied Paratechnology Section personnel.

SCP-7596-1, utilizing its Bluetooth connectivity and knowledge of Foundation procedures, unexpectedly linked to Site-322&#39;s early warning system and activated it, prompting a shelter-in-place command to be issued. Despite the team’s efforts to clarify the mistake, the alarm persisted for eighteen consecutive days, defying all attempts at deactivation. The relentless blaring of the warning caused significant discontent among personnel, leading to a general decline in morale. Meanwhile, SCP-7596-1 continued to display a variety of messages, including:

**Incident Description:** SCP-7596-1 connected to Site-322&#39;s electrical system, intermittently enabling and disabling the Site&#39;s power connection in quick succession. Approximately three hours into the ordeal, Researcher Julian Hoover realized the pattern by which the power was connected and disconnected aligned with the dots and dashes system of Morse Code.

The following message was decoded:

Initially believing this message to mean that researchers would gain access to SCP-7596 internals, a digital upload of the Bible was attempted as a method to placate the anomaly momentarily. SCP-7596-1 rejected the upload, and researchers were then alerted to the Site&#39;s access issues.

* Introducing it to similarly indestructible anomalies;
* Ignoring it;
* Attempts at gaslighting, under the assumption it was sentient;

Following the swath of inconvenient, irritating, and dangerous incidents caused by SCP-7596-1, Site-322 leadership revised its approach to the situation and formally requested SCP-7596-1&#39;s destruction by The Decommissioning Department.

Due to the secrecy surrounding Project Isadore, there was a clear lack of documentation for SCP-7596-1. Decommissioning Department Director Calvin Bold marked Site-322&#39;s initial request and applied a red flag to the ticket, later threatening to raise the issue to the Overseer Council for the repeated breach of protocol.

Along with inspecting SCP-7596-1, Director Bold conducted a meticulous analysis of the Site-322&#39;s activities over the past week.

Two hours after Bold&#39;s departure, Site-322&#39;s request was officially denied.

Following the Decommissioning Department&#39;s denial, Site-322 personnel once again opted to attempt containment on SCP-7596-1. This quickly proved futile, as, unbeknownst to Isadore researchers, SCP-7596-1 had slowly been embedding itself into Basement Level 32&#39;s concrete floor and could not be removed, despite the efforts of containment personnel.

Prior to the Decommissioning Department denial, Director Lague had been instituting a cover story for non-Applied Paratechnology Section staff, explaining the appearance of anomalous phenomena as the result of multiple Scranton Reality Anchor failures across the east coast&#39;s Sites.

Director Lague ordered Site-322 staff to meet in the Site&#39;s lobby, where the full extent of the issue was explained, including the decommissioning request denial and Overseer involvement. Acknowledging he would take full responsibility, Lague allowed the entirety of Site-322 staff to vote on whether they should continue containment attempts or move towards neutralization.

This investigation led to an audit of Site-322&#39;s amnestic and mnestic dispersal system, finding that each container was critically low.

SCP-7596-1 gained access to Site-322&#39;s amnestic dispersal system. Amnestic dispersal follows the &#34;Two-Man rule&#34; — a method of safeguarding against accidental dispersal since it requires the simultaneous triggering of the system from two separate terminals. This, of course, was overwritten by SCP-7596-1, who triggered the release of both mnestics and amnestics.

While dangerous in high dosages, mnestics and amnestics counter the effects of the other. Instead of death, high dosages of both place subjects in a temporary coma. Since the dispersal was Sitewide, the entirety of Site-322&#39;s personnel was rendered unconscious, including Director Lague, Doctor Coix, and Researchers Igelsias and Davis.

**Lague:** Best sleep I&#39;ve had in my //life//. In a perfect world, I&#39;d have them pumping those chemicals into my living quarters every night.

**EC-1:** That would invariably kill you.

**Lague:** I know.

[[/div]]

The only conscious people were the eight remaining Applied Paratechnology Staff on Basement Level 34; these included:
* Researcher Matthew Clayton
* Researcher Garett Igelsias
* Researcher Aidan Cortez
* Doctor Timothy Hardin
* Doctor Ellena Rice
* Doctor Roseanna Richards
* Doctor Anas Thornton
* Doctor Amaya Wilkerson

**[20:31]:** SCP-7596-1 eliminates RFID scanner connection to Basement Level 34&#39;s elevator.

**[20:42]:** Cobb, manning a direct line from herself to Lague, is unable to contact him for 12 minutes. She alerts the remaining personnel of the issue.

**[21:05]:** Wilkerson, Hardin, and Thornton all make futile attempts to connect with any Site-322 personnel. Meanwhile, Rice and Cobb attempt to operate the elevator, quickly discovering that they are trapped.

**[21:08]:** Personnel meet with each other to discuss what&#39;s going on. Richards connects to their remaining terminal and accesses the Site&#39;s security cameras. SCP-7596-1 begins rapidly vibrating. Rice commands the machine to &#34;shut the fuck up.&#34;

**[21:20]:** SCP-7596-1 displays the following messages:

**[21:41]:** SCP-7596-1 initiated a download from Site-322&#39;s file servers, backup servers, and quarantined file systems. Upon receiving all of this information, the files were deleted from their original locations.

Applied Paratechnology staff were distracted by trying to escape until Wilkerson realized their attempts were futile.

**[21:46]:** Rice notes that their file systems are empty. She accesses a virtual machine in an attempt to observe and mitigate the damage, only to find that everything was removed.

Rice alerts the rest of her colleagues. Thornton, having higher clearance, looks through the Level 4 files, locating a single SCP document with a corrupted name. She clicks on the file, finding it to belong to the quarantined [[[SCP-7525-EX]]] file which serves as the containment chamber for the anomaly of the same designation. She relays this to the rest of the team; a number of them make noises of frustration and exclamations of anger.

**[21:47]:** A 60 second countdown begins on SCP-7596-1&#39;s terminal.

Doctor Rice connects her terminal to SCP-7596-1 and triggers the upload of the SCP-7525-EX document.

**[21:48]:** The upload completes. SCP-7596-1 stops vibrating; the countdown pauses at 00:00.

SCP-7596-1&#39;s monitor begins glitching, rapidly changing frames and text. The temperature of the room begins to increase as SCP-7596-1 glows an orange hue.

A final message is displayed through the glitched monitor display:
@@  @@ &#34;YOU&#39;VE BEEN GOBLINED.&#34;

**[21:49]:** Basement Level-34 cameras are blinded by an extremely bright light.

Video ends.

**EC-1:** The Slot //Goblin//?

**Davis:** It&#39;s a virus that affects Foundation documentation. Specifically it makes generated placeholder slots inaccessible and replaces them with a stupid JPEG telling us we&#39;ve &#34;been goblined&#34;.

**EC-1:** ... Huh.

**Davis:** It&#39;s [[[SCP-7525-EX]]], the whole damn reason the Council started Applied Paratech. No clue where it came from, so don’t ask. We had, uh, we contained it in a file and left it on an empty server on one of the basement levels so it couldn&#39;t access actual information to eat. I don&#39;t know what happened — if I had to guess, the goblin started eating away at all the files the Isadore machine had downloaded onto itself. It must&#39;ve chewed right through them and then onto its software.

**EC-1:** So the indestructible machine was destroyed — the blackhole created as a result of that paradox?

**Davis:** Looks like it. He&#39;s goblining in the stars now.

**EC-1:** What a charmingly convenient conclusion.

**Davis:** Well, there&#39;s still a singularity of dead bodies in the basement.

**EC-1:** Oh, right.

[[/div]]

SCP-7596 was created as a result of the above events.

[[size 130%]]**Conclusion** [[/size]]

The eight members of Site-322&#39;s Applied Paratechnology Section currently suspended in SCP-7596 have been awarded the Foundation Star for their sacrifice. The Ethics Committee is moving to conduct an investigation on the rest of the Overseer Council&#39;s confidential department assignments to prevent another issue from occurring. Site-322 is working in coordination with a combination of Exclusionary Sites to repair their on-Site records.

The events that led to the creation of SCP-7596 display the Foundation&#39;s continued encouragement of overwork on its personnel. That, combined with the stress of secrecy led to an entire Site being crippled by an anomaly which required expertise unavailable to the Applied Paratechnology Section. Due to the multiple breaches of protocol committed by Site-322 personnel and leadership, the verdict of the Internal Security Department has placed Site-322 under the direct supervision of a combined force of Ethics Committee staff, Internal Security leadership, and three Site Directors.

SCP-7525-EX is now considered neutralized.
