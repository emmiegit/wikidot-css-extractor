Site-7
[[/&gt;]]

Dear colleagues! The SCP Foundation is currently the most prominent organization that secures and researches anomalous phenomena. Since its very birth, the Foundation has been changing and self-improving. However, we have now reached the point where bureaucracy, administrative contradictions and the necessity of a common standard are unavoidable. Furthermore, we have successfully shifted our research to &#34;quality over quantity&#34; and have accumulated a decent amount of experience in securing and containing SCP objects. Considering the above, it is safe to say that our regular Object Class classification system is no longer viable and ought to be changed.

The system we are currently using (also known as the Object Class system) only considers the danger an anomaly poses with no regard for the containment itself nor the personnel that interacts with it. Such attitude ignores (or oversimplifies) several aspects of containing an SCP object, including the containment difficulty, trigger conditions, etc. The anomaly is classified as Keter in case it is deemed extremely dangerous, ignoring the fact whether or not its danger can be easily negated. Undoubtedly, most of these &#34;Keter classifications&#34; are justified, but for the sake of proper containment our personnel should be able to acknowledge the risks that the item actually holds.

In order to modify the existing classification system the Action Team of Site-7 has conducted an in-depth analysis of after-action reports regarding the breaches of anomalies that had been enlisted less than three years prior. Secondly, our analysts have devised a new danger matrix that not just considers the danger //in vacuo//, but also correlates it with the containment difficulty and the damage that might be done to the Veil.

On top of it, we have scrutinized the behaviour of Foundation personnel during various types of breaches, when adjacent units, unfamiliar with the breaching anomaly, had to be deployed in order to solve the issue. The conclusion is somewhat distressing -- a great deal of adversities and casualties among unauthorized personnel could have been prevented had the object files and containment cells been fitted with a brief and simple explanation of the anomaly&#39;s danger. These are just a few examples:

* On 2020/08/14, an emergency caused a large-scale breach at Site-18. A containment team which specialized in managing Safe-class objects was attempting to retrieve Euclid-class SCP- ████ and SCP-████ from the site. At one point, however, SCP-████ was accidentally activated, leading to many deaths and massive destruction. The incident could have been prevented if the object&#39;s file had a short notice that would shed enough light on the anomaly activation conditions while being easy to grasp at the same time.  

* On 2018/07/11, an assault on Area-21 by ████████ led to complete elimination of all on-site personnel and partial collapse of several SCP-objects&#39; containment cells. MTF Tau-9 arrived 30 minutes later and attempted to mitigate the aftermath by their own forces. Since Area-21 harboured Euclid-class anomalies only, the MTF members were unable to pin down which anomaly should be secured first. Tau-9 spent more than 50 minutes recovering SCP-████, SCP-████ and SCP-████ and extinguishing the flames, while the biggest threat came from SCP-████, which is highly explosive and could potentially obliterate the entire site, yet wasn&#39;t paid enough attention. Fortunately, the tragedy was avoided, but the simple fact that it could actually happen should alert us to solve the problem as soon as possible.

To sum up, Bureau of Classification and Standardization of Site-7 presents the S7 APCS (Site-7 Anomalous Phenomenon Classification System). You will find enclosed a brief explanation and the user&#39;s manual.

[[tab About S7 APCS]]
[[div style=&#34;border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;&#34;]]
Good afternoon, colleagues. Today we shall look at the S7 APCS formatting and main characteristics.

Bureau of Classification did their best to make the new classification bar as informative and intuitively clear as possible, while not overloading it with unnecessary imagery, so it is still suitable for formal paperwork. As such, we have forgone confusing and hard-to-pronounce names and tried to make the visuals distinctive and recognizable.

The model can be divided into 4 parts: the left area, the right area, the top-center area and the bottom-center area. Let&#39;s start from the first one.

The left area is a textbody consisting of three text fields. There are no instructions on how to use it, so the supervisor is free to decide which information should be displayed. If you look at the example bar, you will see that SCP-0000&#39;s supervisor has chosen to feature their own contacts, security clearance restrictions and containment cell information. Also, as you may have already noticed, there is a &#39;CONFIDENTIAL&#39; sign located in the top-left corner of the bar. Besides being a warning against unauthorized usage or disclosure, it also serves as a link to the S7 APCS user manual (including this briefing). Thus, personnel will always be able to quickly find the guide should any confusions happen.

The right area contains the object&#39;s class and number. These do not require any further clarification, so let&#39;s move to the next one.

The top-center area features a set of icons that represent the item&#39;s danger type, with the maximum number being six. Bureau of Classification sought to make these icons simple and coherent, but if one uses an electronic device to view the document, they may hover over the icon to see a tooltip with the danger type that the icon denotes. As of now, they are 54 danger types listed in the handbook, all of which can be found in the &#39;Guide&#39; tab. As can be seen in the example, SCP-0000&#39;s supervisor has described the item&#39;s danger as the following: capable of dealing physical damage, paradoxical, possesses extremely low temperatures, and so on. Lastly, let&#39;s take a look at the bottom-center area -  which is much more tricky than the others.

The bottom side contains three characteristics, as read left to right.

* Activation
* ITI (Integral Threat Indicator)
* VEDIST (VEil DISruption Threat)

Now, we shall expand on each one.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Activation&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34; hideLocation=&#34;both&#34;]]


**1) Activation** designates the cause (condition, pattern) of an anomalous occurrence (activity). In other words, &#39;Activation&#39; is a brief account of events or actions that must take place for the anomaly to manifest. To gain a better understanding of how it works, please refer to the following list of &#39;Activation&#39; parameters.

||~ Activation ||~ Description||
|| Contact || The anomaly is triggered during direct contact with the pertaining item (excluding &#39;Utility&#39; objects) ||
|| Intelligent-control || The item is capable of manifesting the anomaly through its own effort. ||
|| Intelligent-no control || The item is intelligent but has no control over its anomaly.  ||
|| Condition-time || The anomaly is tied to certain dates or daytime. ||
|| Condition-event || The anomaly is triggered as a result of certain events or actions. ||
|| Condition-component || The anomaly is triggered when a certain item or anomalous object is placed in its vicinity.||
|| Condition-location || The anomaly is triggered upon the item entering a specific location. ||
|| Condition-state || The anomaly is triggered when either the item itself, the surrounding environment or other related objects/phenomena enter a certain state.||
|| Cycle || The anomaly manifests in cycles either at a certain interval or after a certain string of events. ||
|| Permanent || The anomaly is constant by its nature. ||
|| Unstable || The anomaly is inconsistent and hard to predict. ||
|| Utility || The anomaly is triggered when the pertaining item is being used for its intended purpose.||
|| Cannot be triggered || The item is either neutralized and no longer anomalous, or does not entail any anomalous activity (e.g. &#34;out-of-place artifact (OOPArt&#34;).||

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ ITI (Integral Threat Indicator)&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34; hideLocation=&#34;both&#34;]]

**2) ITI (Integral Threat Indicator)** is a an overall assessment of the item&#39;s danger. It is defined by two parameters: the breach scope in the short run (i.e. within the period of time when the Foundation is unable to take action) and the breach risk/possibility (containment difficulty).

For the sake of convenience, ITI has been designed as a matrix:

[[=image iti_matrix.png]]

Numbers in the horizontal row denote the breach scope, while letters in the vertical column denote the containment risks. Matching these two parameters gives the ITI value. As you may have already guessed, colors have a meaning as well. When using the classic SEK system, the APCS suggests to base your color choice on the ITI: red, yellow and green areas tally with Keter-, Euclid- and Safe-class anomalies respectively.

It should be noted that the 1-class breach scope is defined by a potential K-Class Scenario, thus there is no breach scope or containment risk value. Instead, one should set the K-Class Scenario designation that might be caused by the breach. The full list of world-ending events can be found [[[k-class-complete-list|here]]].

In addition to those mentioned in the matrix, there are five more unique ITI classes. Please refer to the following table for details.

[[=image itii.png]]

When deciding on the risk of breaching, it is advised to use the following scale.

[[=image iti-cont.png]]

Currently, there are no strict instructions on assigning the breach scope or breach risk classes. In the near future we might add a detailed guide on how to determine the ITI values depending on quantitative characteritics, but right now the supervisers are free to evaluate the item&#39;s danger and set the ITI at their own discretion.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ VEDIST (VEil DISruption Threat)&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34; hideLocation=&#34;both&#34;]]

**3) VEDIST (VEil DISruption Threat)** indicates the object&#39;s effect on the Veil. In other words, VEDIST describes the risk to secrecy during the object&#39;s containment or breaching, as well as the efforts required to maintain it. The characteristic consists of six levels expressed with Roman numerals in ascending order of danger, from VI to I.

||~ VEDIST value:  ||~ Level ||~ Codename ||~ Measures ||
|| Lifted Veil. The existence of the Foundation and/or anomalies has become public knowledge and is no longer deniable. || I || Broken Masquerade || Emergency rule is to be imposed and all military forces of Foundation-allied governments are to be passed into the Foundation&#39;s control until the enactment of the Ennui Protocol. ||
|| Dissemination of information regarding the Foundation and/or anomalous phenomena, which cannot be ignored or given a reasonable explanation. || II || Distant Storm || Public attention is to be diverted from the leakage via geopolitical means. A possible approach suggests evoking social and political unrests on the regional level to prompt governments to declare martial law, restrict freedom of speech, assembly and movement, or impose a curfew (the disorder might be caused by starting a local warfare or an epidemic, sabotaging a production facility, inciting riots or armed rebellions, etc.). During the disarray, the riskiest leakage sources are to be eliminated as soon as possible by any means available, even the most violent ones. Disinformation companies are to wreak havoc in social media in order to conceal the cleanup. Once the measures are successfully taken, mass amnestization might be carried out.||
|| Major public exposure of at least one Foundation department and/or leakage of information regarding an anomalous item, which has spread among a considerable amount of people or across a large area. || III || Fallen Angel || Popular media and top-officials are to be used to publicly disapprove and discredit the leaked information. As an additional measure, public events might be arranged to divert the attention. Such arrangements may include sports competitions, political drama or a sudden death of a celebrity. The disposal of witnesses and important persons related to the leakage is to be conducted covertly, without drawing unnecessary attention. Once the main wave subsides, the remaining civillians may be amnesticized.||
|| Modest public exposure of at least one Foundation department and/or leakage of information regarding an anomalous item, which can be resolved with standard disinformation protocols || IV || Fingerpost || Measures taken depend on the situation and may include media censoring, disinformation in social networks, termination of witnesses, selective amnestization and tampering/redaction of the leaked information. ||
|| Public exposure of a single Foundation-owned operation and/or an anomaly, which are unlikely to result in a widespread disclosure. || V || Razorblade || Termination of witnesses, selective amnestization and retrieval of the leaked information. ||
|| Veil lifting is almost impossible either due to the nature of the item, or the possible breach being unnoticed by the public. || VI || Vacuum ||   ||

Now we know what is S7 APCS all about. The above should be good enough for external personnel, but for the firsthand operators we have prepared the necessary technical information and a guide to using the bar: both can be accessed in the next section.

= **__Parameters__**

* **scp-number** is a textfield that accepts anything of appropriate size, like **SCP-1234** or **SPC-001**.

* **scp-class** takes one value from the list below. The text to copy is **bold**:
 * [[span style=&#34;background:#ffc000&#34;]]##white|&#34;Euclid (**euclid**)&#34;##[[/span]] -- shown as &#34;E&#34;;
 * [[span style=&#34;background:#173d67&#34;]]##white|&#34;Safe (**safe**)&#34;##[[/span]] -- shown as &#34;S&#34;;
 * [[span style=&#34;background:#b80000&#34;]]##white|&#34;Keter (**keter**)&#34;##[[/span]] -- shown as &#34;K&#34;;
 * [[span style=&#34;background:#8B008B&#34;]]##white|&#34;Thaumiel (**thaumiel**)&#34;##[[/span]] -- shown as &#34;T&#34;;
 * [[span style=&#34;background:#31869b&#34;]]##white|&#34;Non-Standard (**Esoteric**)&#34;##[[/span]] -- shown as any character (given later). -EX fall here as well.
 * [[span style=&#34;background:#ddd&#34;]]##black|&#34;Neutralized (**neutralized**)&#34;##[[/span]]  -- shown as &#34;N/N&#34;.

* **non-standard-class** is a symbol that is relayed to the **scp-class** option. It only works if **scp-class** is **Esoteric**, otherwise it may be ignored.

* **lineFirst, lineSecond, lineThird** are separate textfields located under the &#39;CONFIDENTIAL&#39; sign. Each can accept any amount of text that does not exceed the component&#39;s size.
 * Any textfield is customizable via CSS.

* **activation** is also a textfield. It&#39;s advised to take values from the &#39;Activation&#39; section from the previous tab.

* **danger-select-1 / ... / danger-select-6** are danger values the list of which can be found in the &#39;Guide&#39; tab.
 * Inputting &#39;none&#39; will remove the corresponding icon from the component, while others will shift to the center.

* **containment-risk** designates the containment risks. The following table shows the values it may take. Each value matches the one displayed, except for &#39;TS&#39; and &#39;Q&#39; which denote the symbol next to them. The background colour is inherited as well.
|| ##green|A5## || ##orange|A4## || ##red|A3## || ##red|A2## ||
|| ##green|B5## || ##orange|B4## || ##orange|B3## || ##red|B2## ||
|| ##green|C5## || ##green|C4## || ##orange|C3## || ##red|C2## ||
|| ##green|D5## || ##green|D4## || ##orange|D3## || ##orange|D2## ||
|| ##green|E5## || ##green|E4## || ##orange|E3## || ##orange|E2## ||
|| [[span style=&#34;background:black&#34;]]##white|AAA##[[/span]] || EEE || ##848484|TS## -- Ȼ || Q -- ? ||
|||| ##red|KC## |||| ##RED|KETER## ||

* **k-class** is a K-Class Scenario designation that will be displayed by the **containment-risk** option in case &#39;KC&#39; has been chosen. In the example bar above you may see the &#39;CK&#39; designation which is valid since **containment-risk** value is &#39;KC&#39;. Using other **containment-risk** values eliminates the need to fill this option. The complete list of K-Class Scenarios can be found [[[k-class-complete-list|here]]].

* **threat-ind** defines the VEDIST level with acceptable values ranging between **1** and **6**. Hovering over the selected number will pop the corresponding tooltip.
