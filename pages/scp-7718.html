Foundation .aic scanners picked up on anomalous interference in a call received by Agent Harold Lee during a routine shift on 03/09/2019, prompting further investigation. The call has been transcribed below:

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**SCP-7718:** Hello? Do I have the right number? Harold?

**Harold:** Hm? Who&#39;s this?

**SCP-7718:** Oh, got it right! Hey man, it&#39;s Josh!

**Harold:** Josh.., oh - oh wait. Clark? Josh Clark?

**SCP-7718:** Of course! Man, how have you been? I know we haven&#39;t spoken in a while and I&#39;m sorry. Really am.

**Harold:** A call from you was the last thing I expected today, I&#39;ve been doing fine, I guess. Work&#39;s real slow. //(sigh)//

**SCP-7718:** What&#39;re you doing for work these days? I remember when you left for Louisiana, back in what was it, 2003, I think? Probably, but, I remember you really wanted to become a painter, heh. That ever work out for you?

**Harold:** . I mean, sometimes I do think about that, but eh, can&#39;t be caught up on silly shit. Right now I&#39;ve got my hands tied in an //office job. (scoffs)// So at the very least I&#39;m occupied.

**SCP-7718:** Hey, if you&#39;re making cash, that&#39;s more than enough, honestly. And at the very least, if you&#39;re working for some big corporation, you don&#39;t really have to blame yourself for anything they do wrong. Those suck, anyway. Myself, uh, I&#39;ve been caught up in a few ventures, y&#39;know, tried a few things out. Some worked, some didn&#39;t.

**Harold:** Yeah, I get that.

**SCP-7718:** But yeah, the reason I called in the first place, I&#39;m in town right now, another work thing I&#39;m trying to wrangle together. Say, you&#39;d be up for a beer later? It&#39;s on me, for old times sake.

**Harold:** You might have to wait a bit for me to get off work... but, fuck it. Sure. For old times sake. Just don&#39;t try to do your shitty party tricks - the ones from college.

**SCP-7718:** I can&#39;t say I&#39;ll promise anything, but it&#39;s set! Call me when you&#39;re off.

**Harold:** Hey, thanks for this. Really. I&#39;ll call back in a few hours.

**SCP-7718:** My pleasure, man. Seeya then.
