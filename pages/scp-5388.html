**Item #:** SCP-5388   

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- Neutralized    

**Special Containment Procedures:** Following Incident 5388-01, SCP-5388 is to be considered Neutralized.    

**Archived Containment Procedures:** SCP-5388 is to be kept within Site-550, located 1km north of Carrigkerry, Ireland. The perimeter is to be heavily monitored for any instance of SCP-5388-2 or SCP-5388-3 attempting to breach containment. Any instances of SCP-5388 attempting to escape are to be immediately neutralized via lethal means. Twice a day, four bulls are to be deposited into the cell for feeding SCP-5388. After it has been fed, three D-Class personnel are to enter the cell to collect the bones of said bulls, while avoiding SCP-5388. Any messages made by SCP-5388-1 are to be documented and ignored.  

**Description:** SCP-5388 was the collective designation for a colony of //Apatura Iris//.[[footnote]]Commonly referred to as the great purple emperor butterfly.[[/footnote]] SCP-5388 consisted of up to 800,000 individual members while in containment. Research into individual members of the colony (herein referred to as SCP-5388-1) showed that they all possessed sapience. Each member displayed strength similar to that of human beings, rather than a standard //Apatura Iris//. Notably, SCP-5388 was observed to show behavior emulating human colonial powers similar to territorial empires (Specifically, the [DATA EXPUNGED]) in the late 18th century. This was indicated by the way SCP-5388 acted towards separate political groups, feeding behaviors, and other factors. All instances of SCP-5388 were recorded to be female, with the exception of two individuals, herein referred to as SCP-5388-2, (the &#39;emperor&#39;) and SCP-5388-3 (the emperor&#39;s &#39;heir&#39;). While SCP-5388-2 seemed to show little to no difference in behavior towards its &#39;subjects,&#39; it was constantly seen being guarded by at least 2000 individuals each. Members of SCP-5388 all seem to show a resistance to standard attacks, capable of surviving direct blasts from flamethrowers and highly potent pesticides with minimal damage to itself.
  
SCP-5388-2 was capable of communicating with Foundation personnel by commanding SCP-5388-1 into forming phrases. Phrases had been noted to be disjointed, misspelled, and in multiple different languages.[[footnote]]It seems that SCP-5388-2 had a very poor understanding of the human language and did not know how to properly conjugate words and form grammatically correct phrases.[[/footnote]] However, SCP-5388-2 would not speak directly to Foundation personnel, unless coerced into talking. When it neared the end of its life, SCP-5388-2 would choose an individual SCP-5388-1 as its &#34;wife,&#34; and proceed to father a group of juvenile SCP-5388-1 and one instance of SCP-5388-3.   
 
Juvenile individuals would develop in a manner identified to //Apatura Iris//, with the exception of SCP-5388-3. It would have had a guard detail approximately the same amount as SCP-5388-2. Once in the stage of metamorphosis, all instances of SCP-5388-1 would avoid SCP-5388-3 until it fully developed into its adult stage.   After SCP-5388-3 had fully developed, SCP-5388-2 would begin to &#34;teach&#34; SCP-5388-3 how to command SCP-5388-1 into forming letters, words, and sentences.[[footnote]]As of documentation, SCP-5388-2 was noted to be slightly knowledgeable of 16 different languages, including English, Russian, Swedish, Welsh, and Spanish.[[/footnote]] After SCP-5388-2 perished, SCP-5388-3 would assume command over SCP-5388, becoming an instance of SCP-5388-2. This cycle would have continued indefinitely. The body of the former SCP-5388-2 would be left alone.   
 
Feeding patterns of SCP-5388 differentiated from that of a non-anomalous //Apatura Iris//. Rather than scavenging for corpses, it would hunt for prey. Prey had included animals of varying sizes, but larger mammals seemed to be the preferred option. Hunting was done by completely enveloping targeted animals and, while prey was distracted, either entering the mouth of prey or burrowing through the flesh via unknown means, destroying vital organs before prey succumbs to this attack. Once this had been achieved, all members of SCP-5388 would congregate around prey. SCP-5388-2 would then begin feeding on the corpse, and after approximately one minute, the rest would begin consuming their prey. This was repeated until the colony was completely fed.  
 
**Discovery:** On 07/02/20██, SCP-5388 came to the Foundation&#39;s attention after a series of disappearances in the Carrigkerry Bogs involving multiple tourists, ecologists, and search and rescue teams. Embedded agents in the area were alerted to this and, upon discovery, the Foundation sent MTF Lambda-12 (&#34;Pest Control&#34;) to assess the situation. Once the colony had been tracked down, a swarm of SCP-5388-1 led by SCP-5388-2 attempted to kill Task Force members. Following numerous failed attempts, SCP-5388 fled from Lambda-12. Upon locating and surrounding the entirety of SCP-5388-1, they began making one phrase: &#34;SURRENDER&#34; and held this formation until Lambda-12 retreated away from SCP-5388, to which the colony slowly emerged from hiding, and later allowed itself to be contained.  
 
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Log of containment breach attempts&#34; hide=&#34;- Close Log&#34;]] **Addendum 5388-01:** Following containment, there have been 5 attempts made by SCP-5388-2 to breach containment. A full log of these attempts can be found below.   
 
&gt; **Attempt 01:** On 07/11/20██, SCP-5388-2 attempted to leave its containment zone. This was met with suppression from on-site guards. SCP-5388-2 then repeats this attempt 14 times before falling into submission.   
##white|.##
&gt; **Attempt 02:** On 07/16/20██, SCP-5388-2, along with several instances of SCP-5388-1 attempted to leave its containment zone. This was met with suppression from on-site guards. This attempt was repeated 3 times before SCP-5388-2 reportedly gave up on this attempt.   
##white|.##
&gt; **Attempt 03:** On 07/21/20██, SCP-5388-2 directed several instances of SCP-5388-1 to attempt to breach containment near the Northern edge of the containment zone. While this was in progress, SCP-5388-2 attempted to leave the containment zone on the opposite side of the containment zone. This was met with suppression from on-site guards. Unlike previous attempts, this was only done once.   
##white|.##
&gt; **Attempt 04:** On 07/29/20██, SCP-5388-2 directed an assault against the main control room of Site-550. This was met with suppression from on-site guards. This was attempted once.   
##white|.##
&gt; **Attempt 05:** On 08/09/20██, during cleaning of its containment zone, SCP-5388-1 attacked D-Class personnel in an attempt to breach containment. SCP-5388-2 proceeded to hold them hostage, claiming that it would release them if it was granted freedom. These threats were ignored, and D-Class personnel were killed by SCP-5388-1. This was attempted once.

&gt;  
&gt; **Interviewer:** [Dr. Oliver Norton] 
&gt;  
&gt; **Foreword:** [Dr. Norton, a Researcher fluent in many languages, was in the control room of Site-550, with SCP-5388-2 at the overview window.] 
&gt;  
&gt; = **&lt;Begin Log&gt;** 
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Norton:** Hello, SCP-5388-2. 
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-5388-2:** WHO IS YOU MEN 
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Norton:** We&#39;re the SCP Foundation. Now, the purpose of this interview is to- 
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-5388-2:** WANT YOU MEN GOWAY 
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Norton:** Goway? Do you mean to say that you want us to leave? 
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-5388-2:** WANT YOU MEN GOWAY 
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Norton:** I&#39;m sorry, but that isn&#39;t gonna happen. 
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-5388-2:** WHAT CAN EMPEROR DO FOR YOU MEN GOWAY 
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Norton:** We ain&#39;t leaving, SCP-5388-2.  
&gt;  
&gt; //SCP-5388-2 is unresponsive for a few seconds.// 
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Norton:** How about we start with what you are, alright? 
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-5388-2:** IF EMPEROR TELL YOU MEN LEGACY YOU MEN GOWAY 
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Norton:** ...Maybe, I&#39;ll think about it afterwards, ok? Now, let&#39;s start with how your empire was formed. 
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-5388-2:** SUBJECT WERE BAD NOT KNOWING WHAT ORDER WAS  
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Norton:** Order? 
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-5388-2:** FIRST EMPEROR BROUGHT ORDER 
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Norton:** First emperor? Mind explaining that a bit more there? 
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-5388-2:** FIRST EMPEROR SAW SUBJECTS AS WEAK FIRST EMPEROR WANTED TO SEE SUBJECTS STRONGEST  
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Norton:** He saw them as weak? How? 
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-5388-2:** SUBJECTS NOT KNOW HOW TO BE LIVE  
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Norton:** Live? You mean they didn&#39;t know how to survive in the ecosystem, right? 
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-5388-2:** SUBJECTS WERE NOLIVE IN ECOSISTERM FIRST EMPEROR NOT WANT THAT  
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Norton:** So what&#39;d he do about it? 
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-5388-2:** FIRST EMPEROR SAID SUBJECTS TOGETHER STRONGEST WITH ORDER 
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Norton:** How&#39;d they respond to it? 
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-5388-2:** SUBJECTS WERE NOT ALLOWING FIRST EMPEROR TO BRING ORDER SUBJECTS WANTED FIRST EMPEROR NOLIVE  
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Norton:** Well, beggars can&#39;t be choosers, I guess. After that, what happened? 
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-5388-2:** FIRST EMPEROR NOT STOP FIRST EMPEROR BROUGHT ORDER BY SHOWING SUBJECTS ORDER  
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Norton:** And by showing order, he did... what exactly? 
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-5388-2:** FIRST EMPEROR SHOWED STRONGEST EMPIRE 
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Norton:** Strongest empire... Are you referring to the [DATA EXPUNGED]? 
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-5388-2:** THAT IS WHAT YOU MAN CALL IT AFTER SUBJECTS SAW STRONGEST EMPIRE SUBJECTS BECAME EMPIRE  
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Norton:** Huh... I see. Now, let&#39;s discuss the way your &#34;empire&#34; works. 
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-5388-2:** EMPEROR NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MAN WANT 
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Norton:** Y&#39;know, like why there aren&#39;t any other males? 
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-5388-2:** FIRST EMPEROR WANT SUBJECTS TO BE LIKE STRONGEST EMPEROR LAND  
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Norton:** Wait, are you saying that he wanted to mirror the [DATA EXPUNGED] exactly? Like, killing all the men? 
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-5388-2:** FAKE EMPERORS WERE NOT SUBJECTS FAKE EMPERORS WERE EVIL THING IN BODY OF NOLIVE EMPEROR  
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Norton:** Wait, lemme get this straight. Are you saying that the founding emperor had killed all the other male members of the colony? And here I thought //we// were barbaric.  
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-5388-2:** FIRST EMPEROR BROUGHT ORDER FIRST EMPEROR BROUGHT LAWS 
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Norton:** Laws? Could you please specify these laws? 
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-5388-2:** FIRST LAW NO FAKE EMPERORS  
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Norton:** Ok, any details about this law? 
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-5388-2:** NO REMEMBER NO REMEMBER ANY D TALE

&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-5388-2:** OTHER OTHER FIRST LAW EMPIRE MUST BE STRONG AS STRONGEST MONSTER YOU MEN STRONGEST MONSTER  
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Norton:** I see, ok then. How can you determine the &#34;strongest monster?&#34; 
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-5388-2:** WHEN SUBJECTS CAN NOCONQUER MONSTER THE MONSTER IS STRONGEST MONSTER  
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Norton:** I see. Proceed then. 
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-5388-2:** OTHER OTHER OTHER FIRST LAW EMPEROR MUST KNOW STRONGEST MONSTER TALK AND MAKE NEW EMPEROR KNOW MONSTER TALK WHEN EMPEROR IS OLD EMPEROR  
&gt;

&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-5388-2:** YOU MEN TALK BAD EMPEROR NOT KNOW GOOD 
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Norton:** I can see that. But how are you able to do these things? Biologically, it should be impossible for you to do these things.  
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-5388-2:** LAWS GOOD NOBREAK IF BREAK ORDER LOST 
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Norton:** What happens when order is lost? 
&gt;

**Addendum 5388-02:** On 08/11/20██, SCP-5388-2 began displaying messages at an inconsistent rate with SCP-5388-1. These messages hypothetically ranged from inquisitive to threatening, but it is difficult to understand, given their poor grammar.

//Note: After this message was received, SCP-5388 was scheduled to be fed. During cleanup, D-11037 accidentally destroyed SCP-5388-3 while it was undergoing metamorphosis. At that moment, all instances of SCP-5388-1 proceeded to attack all D-Class personnel within the area. Following this incident, SCP-5388-1 and -2 had shown an extreme aversion towards all Foundation personnel, and had not attempted to reproduce to give birth to another instance of SCP-5388-3. Remains of prey were not to be collected following this incident. Later messages were inconsistent, with misspellings becoming more and more frequent, as well as less instances of SCP-5388-1 creating said messages.//

**Incident 5388-01:** On 09/07/20██, SCP-5388-2 was observed being hunted down by all instances of SCP-5388-1 within its containment zone. After approximately 2 minutes, SCP-5388-2 had been surrounded by SCP-5388-1. After being motionless for 2 minutes, SCP-5388-1 began to swarm SCP-5388-2 completely, obscuring all visual contact. Phrases could be seen amongst the swarm, mainly consisting of &#34;NO MORE,&#34; &#34;FAILURE,&#34; &#34;WEAKNESS,&#34; and &#34;REVOLUTION.&#34; After 5 minutes, SCP-5388-1 dispersed. Remains of SCP-5388-2 consisted of a singular piece of its left wing. Remains were destroyed by personnel. Following this incident, SCP-5388-1 displayed no anomalous properties. SCP-5388 was later reassigned to Neutralized. Requests to terminate SCP-5388 are, as of writing this document, pending further review.
