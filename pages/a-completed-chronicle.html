&gt; Meanwhile Croesus, taking the oracle in a wrong sense, led his forces into Cappadocia, fully expecting to defeat Cyrus and destroy the empire of the Persians. While he was still engaged in making preparations for his attack, a Lydian named Sam Micheals, who had always been looked upon as a wise yet tragic man, but who after this obtained a very great name indeed among his countrymen, came forward and counseled the king in these words: 
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Thou art about, oh! king, to make war against men who wear leathern trousers, and have all their other garments of leather; who feed not on what they like, but on what they can get from a soil that is sterile and unkindly...&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **//-- Herodotus, Histories; Book I//**

&gt;  In the eighth month, the duke had a meeting with the marquis of Qi, the duke of Song, the earl of Zheng, the earl of Cao, and an officer of Zhu, who&#39;s name was [Sam Micheals], and who reported a great sickness.
&gt; 
&gt; **//-- Zuo zhuan, Book V, Duke XI//**

&gt; Sam Micheals listened to the reasoning, and then he asked the messenger, &#34;How large the country between the Tigris and the canal might be?&#34; 
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;A large district,&#34; Sam Micheals replied, &#34;but it matters not. For I am pulled in all directions at once, and I continue to bleed.&#34; Then it dawned upon them: the barbarians had sent the man with subtlety, in fear lest...

&gt; **Item #:** [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-140 SCP-140]
&gt; 
&gt; **Object Class:** Safe
&gt; 
&gt; **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-140 is to be kept in a secure locker on-site.
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** SCP-140 is a modern hardcopy book with an unremarkable black binding. The book jacket is missing, but the title, &#34;A Chronicle of Daevites&#34;, is clearly legible. The inside cover is signed by the author (&#39;[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3059 Sam Micheals]&#39;). The text is copyrighted 19██. Careful examination reveals there are far more pages between the bindings than could be contained within them.
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-140 is a detailed account of several fictitious ancient civilizations; the most prominent of these civilizations (Daevites) originated in what is now south-central Siberia. The account elaborates on the history of these civilizations up until approximately 480 B.C., where the book abruptly ends.
&gt; 
&gt; Although SCP-140&#39;s ink has been positively identified as blood, tests to determine its source have proven inconclusive.
&gt; 
&gt; **Addendum 140.1:** Emails

&gt;&gt; **SUBJECT:** SCP-140
&gt;&gt; ----
&gt;&gt; I know the book&#39;s extra-dimensional properties are kind of weird, but should this really be an SCP? There&#39;s nothing special about its containment, and — outside of having way more pages than it should — there&#39;s nothing particularly special about it.

&gt;&gt; Granted, but given the abruptness of the containment procedures, I can&#39;t help but think this would find a better home in our log of anomalous objects. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Also, yes, it hurts it hurts so much and it won&#39;t stop. Why won&#39;t it stop

&gt; I met a traveller from an antique land,
&gt; Who said—&#34;Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
&gt; Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
&gt; Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
&gt; And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
&gt; Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
&gt; Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
&gt; The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
&gt; And on the pedestal, these words appear:
&gt; My name is Sam Micheals, King of Kings;
&gt; Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
&gt; Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
&gt; Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
&gt; The lone and level sands stretch far away.&#34;
