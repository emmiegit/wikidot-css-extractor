[[include component:image-block name=bluediamond.jpg|caption=The only known depiction of SCP-4867, drawn by the 17th century jeweller and traveller Jean-Baptiste Tavernier.]]

**Item #:** SCP-4867

**Object Class:** Safe (Uncontained)

**Special Containment Procedures:** Efforts to locate SCP-4867 are ongoing. A dedicated research team based in Site 890, Wyoming are currently investigating possible locations of SCP-4867 in the Western United States; a fuller description of their efforts can be found below.

**Description:** SCP-4867 refers to a blue diamond, known variously as the //Kuh-e Parande//[[footnote]] Persian for &#34;Mountain of the Bird&#34;. [[/footnote]] or the //Kuh-e Vaght//[[footnote]] Persian for &#34;Mountain of Time&#34;. [[/footnote]].

SCP-4867 is a universal constant, having existed since the formation of matter itself. As such, SCP-4867 is incapable of being altered or damaged in any way. SCP-4867&#39;s properties were observed and discovered by the 19th century Foundation operative Shaun Hammond, who also posited that the existence of the universe was predicated on SCP-4867[[footnote]] See M. Abrams and G. Murray, &#34;Quantum polarity and the aestheticism of Daevite cosmic influences; a study in extrasolar physics and its effects on human civilisations&#34; in //Foundation Research Bulletin// 42 (2018), 89-127. [[/footnote]].

SCP-4867&#39;s last known location was in Wyoming or Montana in March 1871. Further information can be found below.

**Addendum 4867-1: History**

The earliest surviving record of SCP-4867 is in the //Arslanname//, a Seljuk chronicle written by one Zahir al-Dawla al-Kashani, a member of the Seljuk bureaucracy[[footnote]] All copies of this chronicle have been seized by the Foundation and all traces of its existence carefully expunged. Due to the extreme detail in which this chronicle discusses Seljuk nomadism, access to Foundation historians is permitted.[[/footnote]]. al-Kashani states that SCP-4867 was originally found in the Sar-e Sang mine in eastern Afghanistan during the early 11th century. Mahmud of Ghazna purportedly made it &#34;a symbol of his authority as //amir// and //sultan//, and wore it into battle.&#34; It was seized from Sultan Mas&#39;ud Ghaznavi following the Battle of Dandanqan, and in al-Kashani&#39;s time (the mid-12th century) was worn by the Sultan Sanjar in an elaborate crown. al-Kashani&#39;s description of the diamond is sparse, beyond describing is as &#34;blue&#34; and &#34;is eternal, in the manner of the Qu&#39;ran[[footnote]] In the Ash&#39;ari theology of Sunni Islam which al-Kashani followed, stress is laid on the eternal nature of the Qu&#39;ran.[[/footnote]].&#34;

SCP-4867 next emerges in the writings of French traveller Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, who purchased the jewel in Esfahan in the 17th century. Tavernier includes a depiction and lengthy description of SCP-4867, stating that it &#34;existed before Creation&#34; and was &#34;equal in age to God himself.&#34; Tavernier lost the diamond to bandits in Constantinople.

The final written record of SCP-4867 come from the writings of Shaun Hammond, who claims to have seen it in the possession of one Josiah Glass. He claims that Glass, very protective of SCP-4867, took it with him on an expedition to the Yellowstone River in 1867 and never returned. He described the diamond as &#34;irregular but quite magnificent blue gem. My observations have deduced that it is a universal constant, and not a true diamond, despite similarities in appearance.&#34;

An expedition funded by Hammond was organised in 1870. This expedition never returned. A recent investigation by the Department of Temporal Artifacts was launched in 1993 to discover the fate of the original expedition and potentially recover SCP-4867.

**Addendum 4867-2: Results of Investigation**

[[include component:image-block name=yellowstone.jpg|caption=Map of the Yellowstone River.]]

Few records of the initial expedition remain. The only members named in Hammond&#39;s notes were:

* Martin Clyde, Foundation researcher from England. Although largely unfamiliar with the United States and especially the American Frontier, was known to be a leading expert on temporal anomalies and a skilled swordsman. Involved in the 1859 recapture of SCP-173 in southern Alberta.
* Seth Miller, American trapper, frontiersman and &#34;mountain man&#34;. Extensively familiar with the Dakota, Montana and Wyoming territories, having worked as an Army scout during Red Cloud&#39;s War. Known to be somewhat temperamental and occasionally given over to drink, but ultimately a reliable figure who had consistently led expeditions with high rates of survival.
* Friedrich Heinz, expedition cook originating from the German state of Baden. Known to be a quiet man but a first-rate chef, still in the process of learning English.
* Agnes Heinz, teenage daughter of Friedrich.
* Annie Hunter, a frontierswoman and professional scout. Described in glowing terms by Hammond as &#34;singularly charming&#34; and a &#34;crack shot with a rifle, with a life reminiscent of a more sober Calamity Jane.&#34;

In addition, the expedition contained some dozen experienced frontiersmen in Miller&#39;s employ, and &#34;three or four more womenfolk&#34;. All of them were familiar with the region in question and were &#34;known for their honesty and good dealings&#34;.

As Hammond only accompanied the party as far as Fort Pierre, Dakota Territory, his notes cease to be of use after this point. They do, however, detail the broad plan, which was to follow the Yellowstone River south while attempting to find some trace of Glass, his expedition, and SCP-4867.

The following documents and logs have been arranged in an order believed to be chronological.

&gt; One of the strangest stories I ever heard was that told to me by one &#34;Joseph&#34;, a very old Shoshone man whom the tribe considered to be something of a liar, a teller of tall tales. He told me that this happened some forty or fifty years ago, and although probably invented he spoke with such conviction about it that I could not help but record it.
&gt; 
&gt; He claimed that he and his band were camped near the Yellowstone River, and he and his brother were out hunting. They came across a group of whites, no more than 20 in number, arguing at the edge of the river. Although Joseph could speak no English at the time, his brother understood enough to know that they were saying the word &#34;blue&#34; over and over again.
&gt; 
&gt; Joseph claims that these people seemed half-mad and starved, even though food was plentiful for even an incompetent hunter. They had daubed themselves with blue paint, rather- I fancy- in the fashion of Pictish warriors of old.
&gt; 
&gt; One of them- a man with a bottle- was speaking in insistent tone to a man dressed in &#34;fine black clothes.&#34; The second man simply stood and stared at him; he seemed &#34;resigned&#34;, Joseph said, like one who has given himself up to fate. A woman with a rifle over her shoulders was trying to keep them apart. The others stood around them, wailing and weeping. Joseph said that they kept saying something like &#34;Cooey Facts&#34; repeatedly, apparently pleading with the man with the bottle.
&gt; 
&gt; Eventually, the man with the bottle dropped it to the ground. Joseph and his brother started at the sound, attracting the attention of the group; they thus quickly scattered. I have been unable to find any mention of such a sect in any account or history of the early Yellowstone, and I am forced to conclude that the tale was indeed apocryphal.
&gt; 
&gt; Nevertheless, Joseph spoke with such an earnest manner that I almost found myself believing him. For such a trivial story, he seemed to attach a great deal of importance to it. He stated- perhaps self-evidently- that the &#34;Cooey Facts&#34; and the &#34;blue&#34; they spoke of were references to a preserved moment of time that had existed since the dawn of the universe- but why a group of ruffians such as they would care for such matters, I know not.

&gt; **July 18th, 1870**
&gt; 
&gt; Caught 3 large fish from Yellowstone. Bad luck hunting, spooked a pheasant just as I was aiming at a deer which spooked the whole lot away. Will have to try again tomorrow.
&gt; 
&gt; Curious thing while fishing- party of some 6 or 7 men and women coming down the river bank in a half-broken wagon. A handsome woman seemed to be leading the pack, had a gun and was giving orders. Said they&#39;d split off from their party because the leader was a &#34;drunken fool&#34;. They were looking for &#34;the blue&#34;, meaning of course a moment of eternity. Told them that I knew nothing about where it might be except some hunter&#39;s instinct telling them to go south, to the lake.
&gt; 
&gt; Asked them what they were going to do with it when they found it. Woman sighed, said she didn&#39;t know but that it was &#34;all there was left&#34;. Will go south in the morning but don&#39;t imagine they&#39;ll get far- they looked fiercely hungry, and Indians have been spotted in those parts. I warned them but they never listen.
&gt; 
&gt; Strange thing she said was that when she closed her eyes, all she could see was blue. All that I can see, now, too. I close my eyes and it&#39;s laughing. Shows me how small I am.

&gt; These skeletons appear to be 3 male, 1 female. The 3 male skeletons are all between 20 and 40 in age, and were buried in shallow graves. The female skeleton would have been under 20, and was buried in a much deeper and more precisely outlined grave with an (unmarked) stone placed atop it.
&gt; 
&gt; The cause of death is difficult to determine, but analysis of bone marrow indicates that all four were severely undernourished. Of note is the silver crucifix buried with the female skeleton: it was dipped in blue paint and had several bite marks on it.

&gt; //Item #7:// Set of 3 metal rapiers, monogrammed &#34;MC&#34;.
&gt; 
&gt; //Notes:// Bought at an auction of antique goods in Michigan. Traces of blood can be found on the blade. Supposedly recovered from Yellowstone Lake.

&gt; //Item #8:// 2 revolver bullets.
&gt; 
&gt; //Notes:// Bore traces of blood matched to that found on Item #7.

In addition, a male skeleton was found buried near the edge of a nearby cave. Within the cave were the remains, now scattered and damaged by wildlife, of a second man. Several shards of glass could be found in the cave. Both of these bodies were thought to have expired c. 1870.

The ultimate fate of the expedition is unknown.

[[include component:image-block name=banks.jpg|caption=Photograph of Henry Banks, c. 1890.]]

**Addendum 3:** On 08/07/2019, an anomalous collection belonging to one Joseph Banks passed into the hands of the Foundation. Among them was a note belonging to Banks&#39; great-great-grandfather, Henry Banks, a prominent local businessman who had appeared in San Fransisco in 1873. Nothing of his life prior to this was known. The note had been attached to his will, with strict instructions that it was not to be opened until his death, which took place in 1911; after the family read it, it was kept in an iron box in the Banks&#39; household for over a century.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+Open Log&#34; hide=&#34;-Close Log.&#34;]]
&gt; I never told anyone what happened and none of you who are reading this will understand what it means anyway. But keep this note safe. Someone will come looking, one day.
&gt; 
&gt; It was only me and Clyde left. The others had all left but I stayed with him, God alone knows why, I suppose I didn&#39;t have anywhere else to go and nobody to look after any more so I thought I may as well. Well we got further down the river with the last of our supplies and thank the Lord we didn&#39;t meet any Indians or bears or anything.
&gt; 
&gt; Clyde kept marching on but he just seemed more resigned than ever, we all did but for him it was worse. He kept saying that he had to &#34;contain&#34; it. I don&#39;t think he wanted to possess it though. I didn&#39;t either. We all knew what it meant to own it, but we had to at least see it, recover it, stare at it.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally we got to this cave but then Miller came out. He had a revolver in his hand and stank of drink. He demanded that we go no further, that he had named himself the jewel&#39;s protector and nobody could enter the cave. I don&#39;t know why he knew or we knew that it was in the cave but the closer we got, the more we just knew. Like it existed more than we did.
&gt; 
&gt; Clyde told him to go to hell, said that the Foundation had to contain it, said that it would stop the blue behind the eyes, so Miller shot him. But then Miller stumbled and Clyde pulled out his sword and ran him through. Miller yelled something and ran off, towards the river. I don&#39;t know what happened to him but I don&#39;t think he would have survived a wound like that.
&gt; 
&gt; Clyde started towards the cave. I said that he should stop that he was hurt but he wouldn&#39;t and that&#39;s when I realised what was happening.

The rest of the note is composed in a much shakier hand; it is believed to have been composed some time later.

&gt; I pulled out my weapon and shot him and then walked past him into the cave and saw a man, I presume Glass, dead and holding the diamond in his hand. I went forward and picked it up and stared at it some, and saw that it was eternal. I was tiny, a pinprick reflection, staring upwards. Its blue had multitudes I couldn&#39;t dream of.
&gt; 
&gt; Then I thought about Agnes, and Miller, and Clyde, and the Hunters and all the others and what had happened to them. I looked at the diamond, the jewel of time or mountain of the bird or whatever else it was called, this thing of legend. And I thought about how everyone, as soon as they heard about it or saw it or were aware of it, immediately knew what it was.
&gt; 
&gt; I took that liar&#39;s glass and I smashed it, again and again and again, on the floor. I smashed it for all of them, Agnes and Clyde and Annie and God alone knows who else, until it was just blue shards all over the ground. My hand was covered in blood but I kept smashing it until the whole of it was broken.
&gt; 
&gt; I went out and Martin was still crawling towards the cave. He&#39;s cut himself on his sword and the blood was almost gone from him. He asked if the diamond was OK and I said it was and that I&#39;d take it back to Hammond. He had lost so much blood, he was bleeding all over the floor. He smiled and closed his eyes. I buried him, and started out for the west.
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#39;t know if what I did was right, but Clyde was mad, he was going to kill himself and probably more too. I&#39;m sitting in this room in this wooden house in the heat while my children talk about inheritance in the next room. They think I can&#39;t hear but I can. I look out of the window and I see a blue sea, and it seems to laugh at me, laugh and laugh and laugh, laughing all in pieces.
&gt; 
&gt; May God have mercy on my soul.

--Henry Banks is to be posthumously awarded the Foundation Order of Merit, First Class.--

As SCP-4867 is a universal constant and cannot be destroyed, Banks&#39; note is clearly a fabrication or a mistruth. The O5 Council has approved a large-scale search of the Yellowstone area; the location and containment of SCP-4867 is considered a top priority.
