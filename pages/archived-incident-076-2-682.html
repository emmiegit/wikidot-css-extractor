**ATTENTION: REPORT 076-2/682 IS FOR REVIEW BY CLASS-4 PERSONNEL ONLY**

**Incident:** 076-2/682

**SCP involved:** [[[SCP-682]]], [[[SCP-076]]]-2

**Personnel involved:** Dr. Gears, Prof. Kain Pathos Crow, Generals ████████████ and ████, Mobile Task Force Omega-7 (aka &#34;Pandora&#39;s Box&#34;)

**Date:** ██████████

**Location:** ██████, Northern Canada

**Description:** Omega-7 dispatched after reports of [[[SCP-682]]] being sighted in the area. Dr. Gears, Prof. Kain Pathos Crow, Generals ████████████ and ████ temporarily attached to supervise and observe, over objection by [[[SCP-076]]]-2. Contact made three hours after initial deployment.

After several hours of searching, SCP-682 is eventually found in ██████, near ████, having killed the civilian population there.

SCP-076-2 stopped Omega-7 from firing upon 682, then approached the subject. The pair are seen to converse for several minutes, with SCP-076-2 constantly looking back at the main group, and gradually becoming more and more agitated as the conversation goes on.

SCP-076-2 attacked SCP-682 with a bladed weapon.  SCP-682 disarmed and attacked SCP-076-2 with its claws, suffering massive damage.  SCP-076-2 re-engaged SCP-682 after recovering from the initial assault.  Combat proceeded quickly, with both SCPs suffering and dealing enormous amounts of damage. SCP-682 suffered the most damage recorded to date, with damage or removal of over 93% of its body.  SCP-076-2 produced more weapons in this single event than the total number recorded since containment.

SCP-682 was incapacitated, with SCP-076-2 preparing to “finish it off”, when the Anomaly occurred.  Sensors and monitoring equipment measure a enormous burst of electromagnetic energy, radiation, and wildly varied temperature readings.  Site Command received reports from Central Monitoring of a sudden alteration in space-time, localized around SCP-682.  Analysis has shown this event to be consistent with both the sudden appearance and disappearance of a black hole, or the theoretical event of a sudden hole forming between our dimension and another.

Serious questions have been raised in light of the Anomaly, and the repulsed reaction SCP-682 has to most organic life.  It is currently theorized that SCP-682 is not “alive” in our sense of the word, or possibly is extra-dimensional in origin.  

SCP-682 and SCP-076-2 both incapacitated due to physical trauma.  SCP-682 moved to temporary containment.  Remains of SCP-076-2 and combat area firebombed from the air.  Missile test misfire story issued.

//Notes:  I am telling you, it&#39;s not actually here!  I think SCP-076 is the same way.  It&#39;s like poking your finger into a balloon:  you&#39;re inside it, but still outside of it.  They are “projecting” into our reality, and causing all kinds of problems when our reality tries to comprehend them.  It&#39;s like in programming, when you request a pixel that isn&#39;t there, it makes the whole system go haywire!  -Dr. █████████//
