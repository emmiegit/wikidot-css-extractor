Director,

As per your request, here is my finalized report about Agents Spencer and Thorne. It should provide a comprehensive summary of the intel provided by FID and DoA, complemented by some of my own observations from working with the two agents in the past. Additionally, I took the liberty of reaching out to my counterpart in the UIU for additional information; he agreed to share several of the Bureau&#39;s files regarding the duo as part of a larger information exchange (see my earlier memo about Op. Dyson Spotter for details). I&#39;ve gone ahead and included these files as an addendum to my original report.

Finally, because it&#39;s pretty obvious why you&#39;re asking about these two, I&#39;ll repeat my recommendation from the conclusion of the report.

&gt; While Kenneth Spencer and Robin Thorne are among the Bureau&#39;s most competent and qualified field agents with experience in paranormal affairs, and despite both possessing a familiarity with the Foundation and its methods, I cannot recommend that any efforts be made to recruit either of them. This recommendation is based largely on an analysis of the detrimental effect such a move would cause to the operational capabilities of the Unusual Incidents Unit, potentially compromising the mission of JTF Delta-3 and hindering the pursuit of Foundation interests within the Three Portlands LoI.

I trust you&#39;ll make the right call. _

**Operational Role:** Kenneth Spencer is a senior Special Agent assigned to the Three Portlands field office, where he has significant administrative and operational responsibilities. He is the lead investigative agent on most cases originating in Three Portlands, and functions as the commander of UIU/Foundation Joint Task Force Delta-3 (&#34;Organic Free Trade&#34;) during operations within the city.

**Background &amp; Biography:** Born in Portland, Maine, Kenneth Spencer lived a relatively normal life, and was unaware of the paranormal before joining the Unusual Incidents Unit. The oldest son of a federal prosecutor and a Coast Guard officer, he was encouraged from a young age to pursue a career in law enforcement. He attended the University of Southern Maine, where he played baseball, graduating in 2006 with a bachelor&#39;s degree in forensic science.

Kenneth Spencer joined the FBI in 2007, operating as a Special Agent out of the Boston field office for 3 years, until an encounter with a reality bender prompted his transfer to the UIU in 2010. Initially assigned to the Unit&#39;s New England field division, he played an active role in containing the fallout from a failed Foundation sting operation against the anartist group known as Are We Cool Yet. He was subsequently reassigned to the Three Portland&#39;s field office in early 2014, where he currently remains.

**Irregularity Cross-reference:** American, Human, Special Agent, Three Portlands, Unusual Incidents Unit, Wizard

**Capabilities:** Robin Thorne is a wizard with moderate thaumaturgical powers. Specializing in ritual casting and incantations, they are by their own admission comparatively poor at evocation, due to both a lack of skill and raw power. To compensate for this deficiency, they rely extensively on a set of enchanted charms of their own devising, which serve to supplement their abilities and allow them to hold their own in what would otherwise be disadvantageous confrontations. Since 2016, they have also retained the services of a familiar, which is avian in form and assists them in crime scene analysis.

**Operational Role:** Robin Thorne is a Special Agent assigned to the Three Portlands field office as an investigative thaumaturge, where their abilities are used for analyzing crime scenes, locating witnesses and suspects, and neutralizing occult hazards. While not a member of the Unit&#39;s Mobile Occult Operations Team, they may be consulted as an occult specialist in situations where a full MOOT deployment is unwarranted.

**Background &amp; Biography:** Born in Three Portlands, Robin Thorne is a lifelong resident of that city, and a native of the paranormal world. An only child, Robin was raised by their mother, Florence Thorne (aka Florence Elsinger), a Special Agent of the Unusual Incidents Unit and a former Foundation containment specialist who played an instrumental role in the formation of MOOT. A powerful thaumaturge in her own right, Florence instructed Robin in the basics of thaumaturgy, and encouraged their ambitions to follow in her footsteps by joining the UIU.

In 2008, Florence Thorne was killed in action during operations against the Lighthouse Mafia, leaving Robin Thorne an orphan at the age of 17. Still intent on joining the UIU, Robin enrolled at the Three Portlands campus of the ICSUT on a UIU scholarship, where they studied forensic thaumatology and modern ritual frameworks. Upon completing their studies in 2012, they joined the UIU as a consultant, working as a forensic analyst in the Three Portlands field office before applying and being accepted as a Special Agent in 2013.

**Irregularity Cross-reference:** Abnormal Anatomy, Catlike, Genetic Engineering, Parahuman, Special Agent, Test Subject, Three Portlands, Unusual Incidents Unit

**Capabilities:** Renee Morin is a human-offshoot parahuman with abnormal anatomy of a catlike nature. The differences from baseline human biology are largely aesthetic in nature, and do not confer significantly different capabilities; her auditory acuity and night vision are slightly above the human norm, and she possesses retractable claws in place of fingernails.

**Administrative Note:** Due to the circumstances of her origin, Renee Morin has been exempted from normal age-related regulations. For purposes such as calculating retirement eligibility, she is to be treated as if she were 23 at the time she joined the Bureau.

**Operational Role:** Renee Morin is a Special Agent permanently assigned to the Three Portlands field office as an irregular investigator and parahuman spokesperson. As one of the more visibly parahuman irregular agents employed by the Unit, she is an important participant in community outreach efforts in Three Portlands. She is also the primary spokesperson for the Unit&#39;s campaign against parahuman trafficking, and has done several PSAs where she has discussed her own experience as a trafficking victim.

**Background &amp; Biography:** Renee Morin is the result of illegal human genetic experiments performed by ex-Prometheus Labs researcher Dr. Sundar Abelen at the behest of Quebecois multimillionaire Bastien Lachance and in association with Marshall, Carter and Dark. She was artificially conceived and grown //in vitro//, and was subjected to embryonic genetic alterations to give her certain feline morphological features, namely ears and a tail; her original genome also contained a deliberate defect to induce accelerated aging, which was removed using thaumaturgic genome alternation when she reached sexual maturity. One of a number of humans with animal attributes created by Dr. Abelen, Renee would have been trafficked and sexually exploited; however, in 2004 a UIU task force led by Florence Thorne arrested Dr. Abelen and ended his experiments before this could happen.

Following her rescue by the UIU, Renee Morin was placed into the care of Virginia Kartal, a retired UIU Special Agent living in Three Portlands. After several years of adjustment and tutoring, she received her high school equivalency certification in 2009 and enrolled in Three Portlands Community College. Following her graduation from TPCC in 2013, she joined the Unit&#39;s Three Portlands field office as an irregular Special Agent.
