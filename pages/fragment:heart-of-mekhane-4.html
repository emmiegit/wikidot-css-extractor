Sing, O Muse, of the Great Mother,

Called Cybele in Asia, and Rhea-Mekhane in Greater Greece,

Egg that birthed the world and in doing so shattered.

Tell me, muse, of her Sacred Heart, borne by brave Aeneas from ill-fated Ilium to the shores of Latium and Rome.

Buried by Romulus, first King of Rome, who much feared its power,

Having seen it drive a thousand mad, making myrmidons of men,

Iron legions that brought the peoples of Italy to the knee of the sons of ill-fated Ilium,

Guarded for generations hence by the priestesses of ardent Vesta, keeper of the sacred flame.

Chief among the virgin sisterhood was ageless Azura, sister-wife of mighty Hercules,

Who himself stands eternal penance at liminal Gibraltar,

Keeping safe the Great Mother&#39;s power from their dreadful siblings, Fames and Bellona,

Crop-drying starvation and endless blood-drinking war.

And in the dawning of the age of men, when crop-drying Fames and blood-drinking Bellona,

Were yet to be cast to the shores of Africa to wander forevermore,

By the will of almighty Jupiter, highest of the Gods,

When the Great Mother gave freely of her power,

Dwelt mighty Hercules and ageless Azura alongside their brood in near Asia.

Peace, won through battle, was not to last,

For the Great Mother&#39;s blessing, though given freely, was too much for mortal men.

And ageless Azura drank of the Great Mother&#39;s heart,

Took the slender scales upon her mortal frame and so joined the deathless gods.

But mighty Hercules refused, and so was struck mad,

and in his battle rage fell upon his sister-wife and rended her to shreds.

And thus for him follow the Twelve Labors, which all know well.

But ageless Azura was thus sustained by the Great Mother&#39;s power,

And so rested in the hills of Anatolia in her shattered form,

Hearing the call of the Great Mother, herself shattered after the ancient war between Gods and Titans and those before,

Until came the days of mortal men and the raising of the Walls of Troy.

And mighty Hercules, once his labors were done,

Thought Azura dead, and so was split in twain as we all know,

The divine ascending to Olympus, while the mortal stands eternal watch at liminal Gibraltar,

While ageless Azura strengthened in the east, and watched the Sacred Heart,

Behind the vaunted walls of Troy,

Until the day of the Grecian plot, and the flight of fair Aeneas,

Who bore with him the Sacred Heart of the Great Mother, guided by Azura,

Until he came upon the shores of Italy, where he founded Rome.

Ageless Azura found a form, and so lit the flame and called forth Ardent Vesta,

And together they sealed the Sacred Heart deep beneath the Sacred Flame,

And while the fire burns the Sacred Heart provides,

And strengthens thus the glory of Rome.
