**Item #:** SCP-7149

**Object Class:** Keter 

**Special Containment Procedures:** Dr. Nathaniel Maroon, and therefore SCP-7149, is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber located approximately ███ kilometers below sea level at Site-714. This chamber is to be monitored by four surveillance cameras in each corner, as well as equipped with five Scranton Reality Anchors positioned throughout the chamber in order to nullify SCP-7149&#39;s anomalous abilities. If SCP-7149 breaches containment, all Scranton Reality Anchors will activate within Site-714 as well as its on-site nuclear warhead. If this response is ineffective at incapacitating SCP-7149, it will result in an XK-Class End-of-the-World scenario.


**Description:** SCP-7149 is a parasitic, extradimensional entity currently inhabiting the body of former Foundation researcher Dr. Nathaniel Maroon. The consciousness of Dr. Maroon is subsequently split between SCP-7149 and himself. This has been interpreted as an anomalous form of dissociative identity disorder or multiple personality disorder. SCP-7149 is capable of creating and sustaining spatial, biological and temporal anomalies. This only occurs when SCP-7149 is in partial control of Dr. Maroon&#39;s body. No method of extricating SCP-7149 from Dr. Maroon has been discovered thus far, and research is still ongoing. 

**Addendum 1:** **Discovery of SCP-7149**



SCP-7149 was discovered by Foundation personnel on █/█/2016 in ███, Arizona in the United States. It  has been confirmed that SCP-7149 has been active since at least 15,000 BCE[[footnote]]This was discovered using carbon dating of various items of interest pertaining to SCP-7149 [[/footnote]]if not even earlier. SCP-7149 moved itself from host to host up until the present time. Upon discovery, SCP-7149 had been inhabiting the body of a presumed deceased police officer named Asa Monroe. Foundation personnel were able to incapacitate SCP-7149 through the use of a Scranton Reality Anchor missile that subsequently destroyed the entire city. A cover story was developed and proper amnestics were delivered in order to maintain veil protocol. 


**Addendum 2: Maroon Incident**

The following addendum addresses the timeline of events that led to SCP-7149 inhabiting the body of Dr. Nathaniel Maroon, codenamed: &#34;The Maroon Incident.&#34; Date of Event: October 27, 2018. 

**Note:** Prior to this event, SCP-7149 and Asa Monroe were presumed comatose following their detainment by Foundation personnel in 2016.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**5:00 AM:** SCP-7149 awakens within the body of Asa Monroe. SCP-7149 begins to pace around its containment chamber, clearly distressed. Researchers observing SCP-7149 alert Foundation security.

**5:09 AM:** Five Members of MTF Lambda-5 (&#34;White Rabbits&#34;) are inserted to the exit of the elevator leading to SCP-7149&#39;s containment chamber.

**5:15 AM:** SCP-7149 appears to grow even more agitated, and creates a spatial anomaly within its chamber. The present Reality Anchors appear to have little to no effect. This causes the area around SCP-7149 to distort until SCP-7149 is no longer present in its chamber. SCP-7149 reappears after approximately 15 seconds standing directly behind the members of MTF Lambda-5. All five agents open fire, but this has no effect on SCP-7149 whatsoever. SCP-7149 gestures its right hand toward MTF Lambda-5. All five members simultaneously disappear with a flash of yellow light. The area around SCP-7149 continues to distort once more until SCP-7149 is no longer visible. Entire Site is sent into Breach protocol.

**6:33 AM:** SCP-7149 reappears in the mass containment chamber of D-Class personnel. All individuals present appear to panic. SCP-7149 generates a biological anomaly consisting of a plantlike growth impaling the subjects in the right eye socket. This results in the total fatality of all present D-Class personnel. SCP-7149 distorts the air around it and disappears once more.

**7:45 AM:** SCP-7149 reappears in the office of Dr. Nathaniel Maroon. Maroon appears greatly distressed and attempts to fire his Foundation-issued sidearm at SCP-7149, to no effect. SCP-7149 grasps Maroon by the throat and lifts him into the air. Maroon struggles and eventually goes limp. A yellow light originating from SCP-7149&#39;s hand appears to grow brighter until SCP-7149 releases Maroon. This is the moment when SCP-7149&#39;s consciousness was transferred from Asa Monroe to Dr. Maroon. 


**&gt;End Log&lt;**

**Addendum 3: Interview with Dr. Maroon following the Maroon Incident**

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Interviewed:** Dr. Nathaniel Maroon

**Interviewer:** Dr. Jason Hatsfield

**Foreword:** Dr. Hatsfield communicated with Dr. Maroon via a radio communication system while observing from the observation deck. Dr. Maroon is separated within a humanoid containment chamber.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Hatsfield:** Hello, Nathaniel. How are you feeling?

**Maroon:** Jason? Is that you? Oh, thank goodness! It&#39;s nice to hear a familiar voice.

**Hatsfield:** I can imagine. I&#39;m sorry about all this Nate, but--

**Maroon:** I know, I know. I&#39;m not blaming you. It&#39;s part of the job, I guess.

**Hatsfield:** What exactly happened?

//Maroon pauses for 6 seconds//

**Maroon:** I-I don&#39;t...really know. All I remember is some old man blasting himself into my office.

**Hatsfield:** Do you remember using you firearm?

**Maroon:** I-um, yeah, yeah I do. It didn&#39;t hurt him at all. What happened to him, Jason? Is that...thing...still out there.

**Hatsfield:** That&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to find out. Do you remember anything after that?

**Maroon:** Not really. I remember...a bright...light.

**Hatsfield:** When did you see this light?

**Maroon:** That&#39;s the thing. I-I don&#39;t think I saw it how I was supposed to. Instead of the light coming from...from an outside source. I could still see it even if I closed my eyes, like it was...was //burned// into my eyes. You know how if you stare at a bright light, it leaves a sort of blurry mark in your vision? I-It was...it was kinda like that, only this was...bright. Bright and yellow.

**Hatsfield:** Interesting. Do you remember anything else?

**Maroon:** No, I--wait...wait hang on...

**Hatsfield:** Nate, are you okay?

**Maroon:** There was one other thing...a voice...I heard a voice

**Hatsfield:** A voice? What did it say? 

**Maroon:** It said...oh damn I can almost remember! I-It said...um...ah...

**Hatsfield:** Just think, Nate. What did it tell you?

**Maroon:** It said...&#34;We...We are one.&#34; That&#39;s what it said. &#34;We are one.&#34;



**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** Shortly following this interview, Dr. Maroon was detained for further processing. An analysis of Dr. Maroon&#39;s brainwaves yielded anomalous results. Dr. Maroon seemed to have two brainwaves functioning within his cerebral cortex. The second unidentified brainwave was hypothesized to belong to SCP-7149. Dr. Maroon was detained shortly afterward and the above containment procedures were implemented.

**Addendum 4: Online documents recovered from Dr. Maroon&#39;s office computer**

**Note:** This digital document was seemingly written approximately 24 hours prior to the Maroon Incident.

[[div class=&#34;danke agent&#34;]]


JOURNAL ENTRY

DATE: OCTOBER 26, 2018.

My name is Dr. Nathaniel Maroon. And I believe I&#39;ve come across something fantastic. Earlier today, I discovered the existence of an extremely dangerous anomaly that they&#39;ve now designated SCP-7149. From all the stories everyone is telling me, it seems like this SCP is something akin to a god among common men. It was originally detained back in 2016, and it hasn&#39;t moved since then, apparently. Needless to say, I was painfully curious, but access to SCP-7149 is strictly prohibited to anyone below Level 4. Unfortunately, I am simply Level 3.


I wonder what it would be like. To have the powers of a god, the ability to alter reality itself, with a simple snap of your fingers or a wave of your hand. Some claim that power corrupts the minds of those who wield it, and many who know about SCP-7149 would agree with that statement. But I&#39;m not so sure. I believe that if I had such power, I could truly make a difference in this world. And what a sad world it is right now. 

[[/div]]


It is currently unknown if the creation of this document directly influenced and/or caused the events of the Maroon Incident. Research is still ongoing into the possibility.

Hello, O5-12. My name is Jason Hatsfield and I was just recently given clearance to email you directly. The fact that I&#39;m not dead from some kind of memetic kill agent proves this. I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Nathaniel Maroon. Specifically, SCP-7149. It must be terminated ASAP. This thing is a threat to our very way of life if it manages to get stronger. A missile might not be enough next time, which is why I&#39;m submitting an official immediate termination request for SCP-7149.

We do not necessarily disagree with you, Dr. Hatsfield, but there is currently no way of ensuring a successful termination of SCP-7149. We cannot treat this entity like SCP-682, spending endless resources just to inevitably fail in the end. SCP-7149 is on a different level of power. If you can discover an effective method of terminating it, then we can talk. But for now, the best we can do is contain it and hope it doesn&#39;t wake up with all of its godly abilities back.

**Addendum 5: Dr. Jason Hatsfield research into termination methods of SCP-7149**

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
Dr. Jason Hatsfield Research Entry 
Date: August 3, 2019

Research on SCP-7149 has been very limited to say the least. Everyone is scared to death of it, and for good reason. The research we //have// been able to conduct is that SCP-7149 is a sort of mind parasite. It burrows into the host&#39;s consciousness and eventually takes it over. When the host&#39;s mind can no longer take the strain of the extra consciousness, it moves on to another body.

And that&#39;s it. No weaknesses or history, nothing but the concrete evidence. So I thought to myself:
where have I seen something like this before? A mental parasite, jumping from host to host?

And then I had it. [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-963 SCP-963]. I need to find SCP-963. I need to find Jack Bright. If we can manage to place the amulet around Nathaniel&#39;s neck, a mental struggle would take place. Three minds attempting to occupy one body. SCP-7149 is still not at full power, due to the fact it is not fully settled within its host. If the minds of both Nathaniel Maroon and Jack Bright work together, they might be able to completely erase SCP-7149 from existence.

There are some huge risks, though. There&#39;s the idea that it might not work, and we will only succeed in killing Bright and Nathaniel. But also, if it //does// work, and they //do// manage to erase SCP-7149, there&#39;s a possibility that Nathaniel will die anyway. The struggle could not only erase the consciousness of SCP-7149, but his own as well. Which is why I need to be sure. I can&#39;t just let Nate die, even if it is for the greater good. I know it&#39;s selfish, but he&#39;s one of my oldest and best friends.

We originally met in grade school. I remember being the shy kid that had nowhere to sit at lunch until he invited me over. He made me feel like I was wanted, accepted even. Lord knows I needed that, especially with my family&#39;s situation at the time. We&#39;ve been friends ever since, and we were lucky enough to both be recruited by the Foundation. Not a lot of people here have that kind of friendship with a fellow researcher.

But I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s another way.

--Jason Hatsfield

**Video Log Transcript:** MTF-Gamma 88 inserted into the containment chamber of SCP-7149, accompanied by Dr. Jack Bright and Dr. Jason Hatsfield. Team is equipped with shoulder mounted cameras and a single Scranton Reality Anchor.

**Date:** December 6, 2019

**Exploration Team:** MTF-Gamma 88 (&#34;Dust Crawlers&#34;)

**Subject:** SCP-7149

**Team Lead:** Gamma-88 Neptune

**Team Members:** 
* Gamma-88 Liz
* Gamma-88 Bull
* Gamma-88 Smoker
* Dr. Jack Bright
* Dr. Jason Hatsfield
-----

[BEGIN LOG]

//Camera activates and shows MTF-Gamma 88 along with Dr. Bright and Dr. Hatsfield descending to the containment chamber of SCP-7149.//

**Neptune:** Okay, everyone. I&#39;ll go over the plan one last time for the record. We activate the Anchor in close proximity of the anomaly. While it&#39;s disoriented, the doctors here will sneak behind it and put the amulet around its neck. The rest will be up to Bright and that Maroon guy. If something goes wrong, go down fighting.

**Liz:** That makes me feel so much better.

**Smoker:** You&#39;re always just a ray of fucking sunshine, huh Liz?

**Liz:** Screw you.

**Bright:** Way to stay positive, everyone.

//Team is silent for the remainder of the descent. Door opens to the chamber of SCP-7149. Entity appears motionless in the middle of the chamber.//

**Neptune:** Smoker. Get the Anchor. Bull, take my left. Liz, my right. You two, get behind it and get that necklace ready.

//Gamma-88 Smoker prepares the Scranton Reality Anchor while the rest of the team surrounds 
SCP-7149. Dr. Hatsfield stands next to Dr. Bright with his hands wrapped around the chain of 
SCP-963-1.//

**Neptune:** Alright, everyone ready? Smoker, do it.

//Gamma-88 Smoker activates the Scranton Reality Anchor and throws it toward SCP-7149. 
SCP-7149 suddenly stands up. Its voice is heavily distorted as it speaks.//

**SCP-7149:** What&#39;s this? What are you trying to do?

//The Scranton Reality Anchor detonates, and SCP-7149 stumbles backward, seemingly disoriented.//

**Bull:** Go! Now!

//Dr. Hatsfield removes SCP-963-1 from Dr. Bright&#39;s neck. Dr. Bright immediately collapses upon its removal. SCP-7149 screams, and the chest cavities of Gamma-88 Liz and Gamma-88 Bull implode.//

**Smoker:** Shit! It didn&#39;t work!

**Hatfield:** I&#39;m almost--

**Neptune:** Fire!

//Smoker and Neptune fire at SCP-7149, causing Hatsfield to take cover. SCP-7149 gestures both hands at the two agents, and their bodies are simultaneously thrown through the air. A metal rod has materialized in both of their throat cavities, pinning their bodies against the wall. Neptune&#39;s camera is still active, and is directed at SCP-7149.//

**SCP-7149:** Pathetic! If this body wasn&#39;t so weak, I could vaporize you with a snap of my fingers!

//Dr. Hatsfield suddenly charges at SCP-7149 from behind, and attaches SCP-963-1 around SCP-7149&#39;s neck. SCP-7149 immediately stiffens and grasps the sides of its head, seemingly in pain.//

**Hatsfield:** That body isn&#39;t yours! It belongs to my friend, Nathaniel Maroon!

**SCP-7149:** No! I am in control! Nathaniel Maroon is gone! I am--

//SCP-7149 drops to its knees as a bright white light emanates from its eye sockets. When the entity speaks, its voice is no longer distorted. //

**Entity:** Jason! It&#39;s me! 

**Hatsfield:** Wait...Nate? You&#39;re alive!

**Entity:** I am. For now. I came to say goodbye. I couldn&#39;t leave without saying goodbye, Jason.

**Hatsfield:** Hang on...what are...what are you saying?

**Entity:** Jack is holding it off, but he can&#39;t do it forever. I need to end this. It&#39;s up to me now.

**Hatsfield:** Nate! No! No, no, no, no. You can&#39;t die! You&#39;re the only friend I have here, you...you can&#39;t die...you can fight it!

**Entity:** I already told you, Jason. This monster and I are the same now. If one of us is erased, the other must die. I have to do this. It&#39;s my life for millions of others!

**Hatsfield:** Nate...

**Entity:** Goodbye, Jason.

**Hatsfield:** NO!

//The white light increases in intensity until the entire camera view is obscured. A loud humming sound is heard in association with the light. The camera view returns to normal after 30 seconds. The body of Dr. Nathaniel Maroon is situated in the middle of the chamber. Rubble and debris cover the interior, and SCP-963-1 has been removed from Maroon&#39;s neck, and is now motionless atop a massive pile of stone. Hatsfield enter the view, a heavy amount of blood covering his left leg. He kneels next to Dr. Maroon&#39;s body.//


**Hatsfield:** //(heavy breathing)// You...did it...Nate. You...

//Dr. Hatsfield loses consciousness and collapses.//



[END LOG]

**Note:** All members of MTF-Gamma 88 were proclaimed deceased, as well as Dr. Nathaniel Maroon. Dr. Bright and Dr. Hatsfield both suffered several bruises and lacerations, but made a full recovery. SCP-963-1 was returned to Dr. Bright following this incident.

**Addendum: Letter transcribed from Dr. Jason Hatsfield**
The following document was used as a speech by Dr. Hatsfield for the memorial service of Dr. Maroon. Upon Hatsfield&#39;s request, it was included in this entry. This funeral service was held for Foundation personnel only, to maintain veil secrecy protocol. A second service was held for Maroon&#39;s relatives.

I stand here today to pay tribute to an amazing man, who most of you have never heard of before SCP-7149. Foundation researcher Dr. Nathaniel Maroon.

Nate was truly extraordinary. We met each other in grade school, and he was kind to me when it seemed like nobody else in my life was. We went to middle school together, high school, college. I watched him grow into a brilliant mind, and he was the reason I&#39;m here today. I wanted to be exactly like him, because I looked up to him. He&#39;s the reason I came to the Foundation with him. And you know the worst part about this? The worst part is that the world will never know who Nate really was. His family will never realize how much of a hero he truly was.

Nathaniel Maroon not only died a hero, but he did what almost no human ever has:
He killed a god.
