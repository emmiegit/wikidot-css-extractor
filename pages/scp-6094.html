**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation web-crawlers are to continuously monitor websites containing potential SCP-6094 instances. Review of any potential matches is subject to specialized monitoring and identification protocols, which should include direct searches and analysis of no more than 25% of constituent text from any single given instance by any single web-crawler or analogous Foundation software.[[footnote]] Likewise, at least five unique, separate programs are to be used jointly to review and verify portions of all relevant text at any given time, in order to prevent inadvertent activation of any SCP-6094 instances from individual readings of a quarter or more if constituent text.[[/footnote]]

Law enforcement reports, online forums and media, and external news sources are to be similarly monitored for any potential references to SCP-6094 instances and activation events, with special focus given to reports indicative of novel versions beyond those already cataloged; as well as any potential leads relating to Person-of-Interest 6094 (PoI-6094)’s identity, background, scope of anomalous capabilities, and/or their possible accomplices. External incidents involving the activation of any SCP-6094 instance are subject to immediate response by Mobile Task Force Beta-777 (&#34;Hecate&#39;s Spear&#34;), with appropriate amnesticization and misinformation protocols application tailored to the context of any particular version of SCP-6094 involved in any given incident.

**Description:** SCP-6094 is the collective designation of at least twenty-four related versions of thaumaturgically charged text that continuously appear and self-propagate across the internet.[[footnote]]Individual versions are sub-designated numerically, starting with SCP-6094-1 and increasing based on the chronological order of their respective discovery by the Foundation.[[/footnote]] Each version closely resembles standard //Lorem Ipsum// placeholder text commonly used in physical and virtual modern written media (such as new or unfinished web pages where SCP-6094 tends to manifest), with instances textually differing only slightly from non-anomalous pieces of text, as well as from each other.

[[/=]]
----
The text constituting the modern [https://www.lipsum.com/ Lorem Ipsum] text derives from a section of a Latin-language work __de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum__ (//The Extremes of Good and Evil//) by the Roman philosopher Cicero. However, the wording has undergone various major changes and mutations from the source material over time, primarily with the beginning of its use as dummy text in the Renaissance-era printing and typesetting industries. As such, the verbiage does not express any particularly meaningful or coherent semantic message even in the Latin language on which it is based, but does vary enough from word to word so as to be minimally distracting when used as filler text while focusing on development of non-textual elements in various written and digital media.

For comparison and reference, the most common or “standard” modern iteration goes as follows:
&gt; Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
The original section of Cicero’s work from which the above text is based reads as follows:
&gt; ...dolorem ipsum, quia dolor sit amet consectetur adipisci[ng] velit, sed quia non numquam [do] eius modi tempora inci[di]dunt, ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem. Ut enim ad minima veniam, quis nostrum[d] exercitationem ullam corporis suscipit laboriosam, nisi ut aliquid ex ea commodi consequatur? [D]Quis autem vel eum iure reprehenderit, qui in ea voluptate velit esse, quam nihil molestiae consequatur, vel illum, qui dolorem eum fugiat, quo voluptas nulla pariatur? [33] At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus, qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti, quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint, obcaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa, qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga.
[[/div]]
[[/collapsible]]

Activation of an instance of SCP-6094 results when an individual visually perceives and actively begins to read (whether audibly or silently) any part of the constituent text. Onset of effects usually begins about 25% to 35% of the way through in most cases across most versions, with the strength of their effects usually increasing in some manner based upon the reader’s continued progression. Though this renders small enough portions of the text to be effectively non-anomalous if removed from the rest of the instance, it also enables new instances to spread unnoticed for extended periods of time.

Artificial intelligences can usually trigger SCP-6094&#39;s effects by the same methods as humans, though the nature of the effects on any artificial programs and constructs may vary somewhat based on the exact properties of a given version. New SCP-6094 instances can appear after an existing instance has been activated by spreading to some other open or recently accessed web page on the device from which it was activated. --This is the only known way new instances are generated.-- (Update: See Addendum 6094.03) 

Other than this common method of propagation, the exact anomalous effects of each version of SCP-6094 text when activated vary significantly from version to version. However, each has so far been found to contain one or more changes based on wordplay, based on English, Latin, or both; or otherwise intuitive references to the nature of a given version&#39;s anomalous effect, always at least partially contained within the first sentence and its own textual deviations. However, such “clues” are usually too vague to convey any particularly meaningful details to a reader without actually reading along far enough to trigger the effect anyway and thus experience the results, leading to a fairly limited utility of this property.

----
**Progression Effects:** Duration of the primary effect, running from approximately 2 and a half minutes to 48 hours as the reader progresses.
----
**Additional Notes:** Affected individuals almost always appear to instinctively realize their sudden need of water for continued respiration, and as such rarely finish through the entire text. However, D-class testing has shown that, if pushed, a full or near-full reading will result in rudimentary gills beginning to form at the base of the neck, and the duration of the effects will greatly lengthen.

[[size 90%]]**Primary Effects:** At least one member of the order //Didelphimorphia//[[footnote]]Commonly known as possums or opossums.[[/footnote]] and/or similar mammals will appear after a variable amount of time, and attempt to interrupt or otherwise add unnecessary difficulty to whatever tasks the subject is engaging in by the time of the animals&#39; arrival. Priority will be given to any employment or money-making endeavors, and any loose currency or financial instruments may also be taken during these incidents.
----
**Progression Effects:** Generally, larger and larger quantities of animals will appear as more of the SCP-6094-2 instance is read, though it is currently unknown if the primary factor in this is increasing range of effect or simply a matter of the increasing number of affected animals in a pre-determined area. 
----
**Additional Notes:** Variation in the number and type of animal(s) that arrive appears to also be in part a result of the fact the anomalous effect simply affects and attracts nearby wildlife, rather than //creating// new creatures. For example, members of //Didelphimorphia// almost always appear when the effect is activated within a given species&#39; geographic range, while the type of mammals attracted in areas outside these regions may become much more broadly applied in terms of genetic or phenotypic similarity.

----
**Progression Effects:** Impacted area of the primary effect expands, running from approximately 13 meters to 45 meters as the reader progresses. 
----
**Additional Notes:** Once the maximum temperature is reached, the heat from the affected material begins to dissipate at normal rates based on non-anomalous physical properties of the surrounding environment.[[/size]]

[[size 90%]]**Primary Effects:** Any human within a radius of approximately 12 meters will begin to undergo targeted alterations to some physical feature or features in such a way as to more closely resemble the features of members of the //Sus// genus.[[footnote]]A genus which includes pigs and boars.[[/footnote]] Such alterations will appropriate existing body parts and tissue as needed, and have been reported to be extremely painful. Examples of porcine physical features and traits generated by SCP-6094-13 include: 
* Pointening of the ears
* Flattening of the nose to resemble a snout
* Modification of hands and/or feet into hoof-like structures
* Growth of small and sometimes curled tail
* The development of “tusks”
----
**Progression Effects:** Increasingly drastic or consequential physical alterations in affected subjects.
----
**Additional Notes:** Similar porcine features can be approximated through different mechanisms from iteration to iteration. For example, the development of tusk-like protrusions usually involves the splitting of the jaw at the middle and the outward shift of each side through the remains of the mouth along with the shedding of the bottom teeth; however, one experiment resulted instead in a subject removing two of their own ribs (apparently under involuntary compulsion) and placing the broken ends in each side of their mouth, where they then fused to the surrounding tissue in the back of the mouth.[[/size]]

Research into the origins of SCP-6094 eventually led to the discovery of relevant posts by an individual posting under the user ID &#34;ModernMagicModder&#34; on the deep web forum &#34;BlackHatSorcery&#34;, which is primarily geared towards discussions, guides, and broader developments regarding techno-thaumaturgical practices; especially in regard to usage in conducting various criminal and illicit activities.

[[/=]]
----
Confirmation of the veracity of the connections to SCP-6094 and related claims made by the user known as ModernMagicModder took major investments of time, manpower, and technical resources. Two specialized Deep-web crawlers and one specialized AI construct were irreparably damaged and ultimately decommissioned due to various defensive wards, glyphs, and rituals, (as well as at least one advanced but ultimately non-anomalous virus) embedded within the site to deter and/or disable any outside scrutiny. 

After twenty-four days of attempts to clandestinely access the forum meeting varying levels of success, enough evidence was gathered to establish with a significant level of confidence the direct involvement of ModernMagicModder in the creation and dissemination of SCP-6094; they have been designated Person-of-Interest 6094 (PoI-6094) as a result. 

Though little is yet known about the identity or personal background of PoI-6094, some important facts and information about their abilities and motivation in creating SCP-6094 have been gleaned from the accessed forum posts and comments. Relevant Samples are included below:

And I see our criticism is as unconstructive as ever, TT. Obviously, I was gonna get to the detail very shortly… Anyway, I&#39;ve been playin around with some standard online hidden-hex type shit, just doin some research and all, when I mistyped a URL and came to this undeveloped webpage. Basically just a few paragraphs and broken links. 

Now, the paragraphs were all that broken-Latin filler wording, but w my mind being where it was, I didn’t even realize I was on the wrong page at 1st and thought it was some archaic spells lol. I quickly realized the truth ofc, but it gave me an idea. If even a pro like me can get that crap mixed up with spells, maybe I could actually turn it into one! Or five, or fifty…

Anyway, back to my devious epiphany.

Nah, and I doubt that would be workable anyway. He had to do some giant ritual and like four different unseemly pacts to get it to work, and even so the glyphs are only powerful enough to give you a migraine if you look at it for more than 6 seconds.

Sooooo bit of a problem. Remember how I mentioned last week Merlin and Newt helped me develop another Lorem Ipsum spell that acts on the other spells, and that basically adds a virus-type property to the spell to give me access to any device webcams so I can watch the results in real-time?

-----
[[size 125%]]##Indigo|Arcane_Arca9## [[/size]]
[[size small]]##Indigo|02/06/2022##[[/size]]

Wait, I don’t remember this actually. Why would you not just do a regular working on all the spells at once? Why craft another Lipsum spell?

-----
[[size 125%]]##Maroon|ModernMagicModder##[[/size]]
[[size small]]##Maroon|02/06/2022##[[/size]]

Well I was doing something similar for each spell activation one at a time at first, but it turns out that that is hard and both time- and energy-consuming. Doing them all at once would be exponentially harder. First off, there&#39;s not a similar connection; getting a normal type of thaumic act to affect a different/ ‘unlike’ act is already a big ask, but when you consider how //Wonderfully// successful my spells have been so far at spreading far and wide, it’d be almost impossible. 
----
If I narrowed it down to just a few spells at a time though, I’d still have to do a separate re-cast every time, and I don’t have the time, money, or manpower for that lol. Buuuut If I craft one big new single spell within the same class as the spells its affecting, then not only is it use less energy to make, I also don&#39;t have to recast it since its self-propagating!

We just made the effect that every time someone activates the new spell by reading it, it enables the nearest spell of any other type that’s loaded on a page to also commandeer the webcam and mic of the hosting device!

Oh sorry, that’s the nickname the [[[serpent-s-hand-hub | group I used to run with]]] always called them. Nomenclature isn’t really the big issue here though

Even if there checking this deep in the deep web, do you really think they could get past all this site&#39;s defenses?

Immediately? Probably not. Eventually? Probably, if they reeeally tried. They do have some top-notch collaborationist mages.

Yeah, opressing tbeir kind for who-knows-what twisted reasons. Probably money.

Regardless, if they’re responding this quickly to the aftermath of MMM’s little project… Well I (don&#39;t really) hate to say it, but you might be fucked.

OK well as usual, I’m both optimistic and brazenly out of my element here, so I need you peeps to tell me everything you know so I can get out of this little pickle.

Tell you what though, as a sign of gratitude and quasi-respect (and also to ensure you don’t sabotage me), I’ll decommission your doll once trouble blows over. That’s about 13.4 days of usage left that I’m graciously agreeing to surrender

Alright, but ONLY if you agree to promise to not use it anymore even until then. And I mean I want all this im a full-on, hardcore binding pact.

Um heya pals, maaaybe we should take any further discussion to an even more discrete venue? One with less of a direct trail in case these Men in Black types or whatever IS eventually able to worm its way in here?

Oh and also, delete this entire thread immediately, of course. I&#39;m gonna go alert the mods too.

**NOTE:** As the Foundation had already surpassed the heavy security measures (anomalous and non-anomalous) and encryption to infiltrate the BlackHatSorcery forums, live-monitoring agents were able to transcribe this last thread in real-time before it could be deleted.[[footnote]]Other than the briefly embedded video presumably showing MTF-Beta 777 response to an unspecified SCP-6094 activation event, as a copy of which was not successfully retrieved prior to its quick deletion.[[/footnote]] Other threads even tangentially related or alluding to SCP-6094 activity on the forums were quickly deleted as well.

= [[size 125%]]**##Maroon|Addendum 6094.03: New Versions##**[[/size]]
----
[[/div]]

From June 7 to June 10, 2022, the Foundation discovered that at least four new versions of SCP-6094 have been introduced and have begun to propagate. The first instances of each were discovered within less than four hours of each other. Unlike most of the initial versions, these new versions of SCP-6094 appear to have been geared toward initiating a much more aggressive spread of SCP-6094 as a whole, and/or obfuscating Foundation efforts at suppressing its influence. A description and partial segment for each new iteration, gleaned from a mix of initial D-class test runs and external incident monitoring, is given below:

[[size 90%]]**Primary Effects:** Scrambles words and numbers on any open pages, random files, and even underlying code from the device from which the instance is read from into nonsensical configurations.
----
**Progression Effects:** More files and programs are affected as a reader progresses farther through the text.
----
**Additional Notes:** It appears that the SCP-6094 instance itself is the only type of text which never appears to be subject to mutation.[[/size]]

[[size 90%]]**Primary Effects:** Causes another, seemingly random version of SCP-6094 to appear as a physical new instance via writing carved out of the nearest source of concrete.
----
**Progression Effects:** Unknown, if any.
----
**Additional Notes:** Whether the resulting instance maintains anomalous activation effects is inconsistent, but appears to largely depend on which version generates. For example, SCP-6094-2 appearances have maintained their effects in 95% of recorded instances, while SCP-6094-22 has only been successfully activated once.[[/size]][[footnote]]Specifically, when an instance manifested on a sidewalk near a local grade school covered in recent chalk drawings and writing. Even then, changes were relatively minimal.[[/footnote]]

[[size 90%]]**Primary Effects:** Makes readers develop a strong urge to immediately create or develop websites devoted to a particular passion or interest they already hold. Those with insufficient technical skill or background in such projects will usually seek out online courses related to beginner-level web development first. Though the subjects that these new websites are dedicated to vary wildly from creator to creator, these individuals will always place instances of both SCP-6094-24 as well as of some other SCP-6094 version.[[/size]]
----
[[size 90%]]**Progression Effects:** Duration of compulsions, ranging from approximately three hours to as long as --five weeks-- ten days.[[/size]]
----
[[size 90%]]**Additional Notes:** Upkeep of web pages created under the influence of SCP-6094-24 appears to be rare once the effect has worn off, though not unheard of. One affected individual continually recreated close variations of their previous site each time Foundation web-crawlers took it down.[[/size]][[footnote]]Each was devoted to taxidermy; examples of URLs include www.Taxidermylife.com, AmateurTaxidermy.com, and StuffingAnimals.net[[/footnote]]
[[size 90%]]While initially believed to be under prolonged anomalous compulsive effects, it is now believed that the individual had simply been recreating the sites out of sheer stubbornness using consistently updated backups, as a one-time shift in tactics to simple removing only the SCP-6094 instances for three days before finally taking down the whole site again saw the individual’s subsequent version no longer contained any SCP-6094 instances.[[/size]][[footnote]]The current iteration, TheTaxidormitory.net, remains up, though under continuous Foundation monitoring.[[/footnote]]

Due to the inherent and increasing risk of continued experimentation, all further testing has been suspended indefinitely, and phenomenological research should be refocused solely to external incidents.

Additionally, as of June 9, 2022, Foundation researchers and software have lost access to BlackHatSorcery deep web forums. Additional staff and resources have been assigned to assist in bypassing the presumably upgraded cybersecurity and thaumaturgical defenses of the site, as well as to bolster efforts more broadly in investigating, identifying, and eventually apprehending PoI-6094.
