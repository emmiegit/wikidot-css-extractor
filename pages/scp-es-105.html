**Item #:** SCP-ES-105

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the nature of SCP-ES-105, containment efforts are to be focused around cataloguing individuals with a strong interests in constellations, celestial bodies, and ecological trends. The database is to be operated and maintained by the governments of major world powers and population centers, and managed by the Foundation&#39;s Disinformation Bureau. The Bureau will update the database with research on groups following the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/fifthist-hub Fifthist] doctrine.

In addition, Foundation facilities with astronomical equipment are to observe and verify visible stars corresponding to the astronomical catalogue Tycho-2 in order to detect manifestations of SCP-ES-105.

In the event of reported changes in sky color and/or widespread streetlight outage, cover stories are to be implemented stating the anomalous effects are due to light pollution or eco-terrorism.

Any located instances of SCP-ES-105-1 are to be seized and brought to Site-76.

**Description:** SCP-ES-105 is a manifestation that appears at an altitude of 25,000 meters several days before events considered important (e.g. concerts, riots, sightings of unidentified objects or creatures, etc.) take place. SCP-ES-105 events exclusively affect the areas where they manifest, and supplant celestial bodies present in the sky with others, giving preference to those celestial bodies (mainly constellations or asterisms[[footnote]]A group of stars that, when seen from Earth, appear to have a special arrangement or alignment in geometric form that is easily remembered.[[/footnote]]) with pentagonal forms, or which contain at least five stars. 

SCP-ES-105&#39;s first noticeable effect is altering the perception of those within the area, making them believe that the firmament currently present is non-anomalous. A detailed description of an SCP-ES-105 manifestation (henceforth known as Celesta Event) is attached below.


[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Document Celesta-001&#34; hide=&#34;- Document Attachment&#34;]]
&gt; **CELESTA EVENT STAGES**
&gt; 
&gt; **First Stage:** The start of a Celesta Event. All celestial bodies are replaced[[footnote]]In subsequent Celesta Events, however, it has been found that SCP-ES-105 &#34;hides&#34; the celestial bodies, rather than completely supplanting them.[[/footnote]] in the area. If a subject outside of SCP-ES-105&#39;s area of effect enters, they will begin to be affected by the anomaly. SCP-ES-105 also affects subjects who are sleeping and will proceed to move them to a place where they are capable of seeing the sky.
&gt; 
&gt; **Second Stage:** Green and pink fumes will generate around the anomaly[[footnote]]The fumes are non-anomalous instances of the St. Elmo&#39;s fire weather phenomenon.[[/footnote]]. The origin of the fumes is unknown. The effects of the first stage still persist.
&gt; 
&gt; **Third Stage:** Those affected will stop perceiving stimuli outside of SCP-ES-105&#39;s area of effect. They will proceed to perform specific actions depending on the constellation or asterism present in the sky. If a person outside the area of effect enters, they will not be affected by SCP-ES-105.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fourth Stage:** The constellation or asterism present will begin to blink with varying brightness. The reason for this is unknown. Previous stages will begin to affect those directly outside the area of effect.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fifth Stage:** The Celesta Event ends. Following this, between 0.█% and 12.5%[[footnote]]It is unknown what variables change the percentage of people affected.[[/footnote]] (with a minimum of one person) will experience permanent effects vaguely related to the third stage, and a greater affinity for practices similar to Fifthism. All Celesta Events, after their completion, cause subjects to have a compulsion to stargaze, ranging from slight desires to committing eco-terrorist attacks in order to shut off streetlights and see the stars.

**Discovery:** The first official sighting of SCP-ES-105 occurred on August 17th, 1969 in Bethel, NY, at the Woodstock Festival, approximately 1:00 AM local time. The Celesta Event began with the replacement of the Lacerta constellation with the Lyra constellation. The incident was apparently initiated by alleged Fifthist musician James Marshall &#34;Jim&#34; Hendrix, when he pronounced a variation of the phrase &#34;Imagination is the key to my lyrics, the rest is painted with science fiction,&#34; emphasizing the stars&#39; &#34;powers&#34; and how to absorb them. Following the conclusion of the Celesta Event, approximately █.█% of attendees were permanently affected by SCP-ES-105, resulting in the formation of eco-friendly villages, and eventually culminating in the &#34;Back to Earth&#34; movement. Along with this, greater environmental awareness and opposition to the Vietnam War began.

On 09/02/1969, the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/unusual-incidents-unit-hub Unusual Incidents Unit] arrested ten people in Tucson, Arizona as part of Operation Morning Star, established for the purpose of suppressing the growing outbreaks of counterculture caused by the Vietnam War and Protests of 1968. All arrested persons held and disseminated an alternative form of hippie philosophy, giving great importance to incense rituals, chants, stars, and the number five[[footnote]]Although all of these characteristics are inherent to Fifthism, neither the Foundation nor the UIU had recognized Fifthism as a Group of Interest at the time.[[/footnote]]. Several star charts, catalogued as SCP-ES-105-1, were located, and found to have been anomalously modified to temporarily alter the appearance of the sky. Due to the UIU&#39;s lack of resources, the objects were subsequently handed over to the Foundation. How SCP-ES-105-1 operates is still unknown.

&gt; **Effects of the Celesta Event:** Aquaphobia, herpetophobia, greater recognition of patterns,  mild paranoia.
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** Several days later, Edna MacInnes saw an instance of SCP-████ in Loch Ness. Subsequently, camouflaged agents in the surrounding area administered Class-B amnestics and returned her to the riverside of Loch Ness, replacing SCP-████ with a log.

&gt; 
&gt; **Transcription:** Brethren, we are here today to commemorate the ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ, crucified on the Five-Pointed Cross, to Heaven. As we all know, Paradise is a place full of fumes with stars like the pearls of Our Lord. As is to be expected, you must take your incense holders to &#34;perfume&#34; its home and rise up to the Truth. Remember, all this is for the Southern Polar Star, better known as the divine sign, to appear and take us with it. And remember: if you love him not, his archons will not let you ascend.
&gt; 
&gt; **Effects of the Celesta Event:** Conversion to Catholicism, or greater religious adherence if they had already been believers. Increased use of incense spirals at Sunday Masses.
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** The Catholic rites after SCP-ES-105 are similar to those practiced in the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1982 southern United States]. Henceforth, an investigation is being conducted into Catholic dioceses to find possible infiltration from members of The Fifth Church and its branches.

**Addendum 1:** On 05/17/2010, a court order was obtained to search the home of Amador Márquez in ████, Uruguay. When their belongings were searched, agents found a wooden cross with the lower end separated in half, similar in appearance to a star; several sticks of incense; and a series of notes he had written.

&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m not a man fond of writing, but since what happened in Montevideo, I feel the need to. At least, someone must be able to speak of them. The nation will know what that light was. The world will know.

&gt; 07/05/87
&gt; 
&gt; Fucking bastards. Those so-called journalists laughed in my face. They told me I was crazy and that I was just a conspiracy theorist or a televangelist. Fools, I saw Him! I saw His grace and His wrath. I don&#39;t know why he left me alive, but I feel his call. I hear it more and more — even yesterday, I couldn&#39;t sleep because of His voice.

&gt; 07/07/87
&gt; 
&gt; I can&#39;t take it anymore. If He wants His will to be done, I will do it. I hope that at least he&#39;ll let me sleep.

&gt; 
&gt; It&#39;s been almost a year and a half now. I&#39;m almost not bothered by His voice anymore, and it turns out that I&#39;m learning a lot of facts about Christianity, like how the number five symbolizes God&#39;s grace. Good number, although I don&#39;t know why I have noticed that one and not others like six, seven, or twelve. I am also getting back in touch with people, though no women. Too bad, my old self would have loved to be in their presence.

&gt; 
&gt; I finally got assigned to a church. Not bad, but it&#39;s getting a bit old. The audience was very bored, and I don&#39;t think they understood my sermon. But everyone will understand. One only has to let oneself be carried away by the Word.

&gt; 03/21/92
&gt; 
&gt; This mass was a little better than the last one. At least they didn&#39;t fall asleep, and some parishioners even asked for His blessing.

&gt; 04/05/92
&gt; 
&gt; Yesterday afternoon, after the end of mass, two people came in who said they knew one of my former companions. They told me that they were former workers of a weekly newspaper called &#34;El Caso&#34;[[footnote]]Spanish weekly, specialized in news of events, which was published in Madrid between 1952 and 1987.[[/footnote]], and that they were looking to start a new South American weekly called &#34;The Horizon&#34;, focusing on paranormal and religious phenomena. I told everything I knew and then they left. At least someone believes me, even if they seem to be nutty.

&gt; Today I received a pleasant surprise from Jaime Pérez, an old acquaintance from the Montevideo incident. He came to see me about how my life was going, and I took advantage of his questions to return them, and get to know him a little better. He told me that he was part of a religious initiative with ecumenical tendencies called &#34;The Union of the Five,&#34; which would be a union of the five most influential religions[[footnote]]Currently, the five major religions being Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism.[[/footnote]]. He rose in the ranks doing charity work in Europe, apparently.
&gt; 
&gt; He told me that if I wanted to help him, he would help me know more about the light I saw and what lies beyond.

&gt; 07/16/95
&gt; 
&gt; I decided to try out a little thing while in practice that Jaime suggested to me. A bit of incense, like the Galicians, and a bit of dancing, and everything would be fine.
&gt; 
&gt; I was right. They sang and breathed the smoke like --madmen-- those who want to know more about Our Lord.

&gt; 
&gt; Yesterday, I had a dream and a revelation. I was sitting on a chair, and in front of me Jaime appeared, along with a few cups of tea. He told me we were in Paradise, specifically in the Fifth World. I took a look around me and saw this strange plane, with stone floors carved with identical pentagons. People running around with their own free will in what appeared to be the Garden of Eden. Animals and plants of unparalleled color and appearance, all bathed under the pink light of a Great Cosmic Starfish.
&gt; 
&gt; After that, Jaime told me that, before resting here, he had a great mission. I had to call the Southern Star so the Fifth World would know we wanted to receive it. Seeing what Paradise was like, I willingly accepted.

&gt; [EXTRANEOUS DATA REMOVED]

&gt; 02/11/99
&gt; 
&gt; I did it. I used the words that Jaime has been teaching me to unlock the bonds of the mind. At first they were surprised, but in the end, they understood and nodded. They&#39;re starting to mature.

&gt; 09/05/05
&gt; 
&gt; People haven&#39;t been coming in lately, all because of that damned [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1425 book]. Half of my parishioners disappeared and the bishops are beginning to complain about my unorthodox practices. I don&#39;t know whether to listen to Jaime and use a few sentences from it.

&gt; [EXTRANEOUS DATA REMOVED]

&gt; 04/15/10
&gt; 
&gt; They&#39;re ready to go. We all are. I can see how our souls are freer, our bones are looser, and our flesh is softer. I can see how we rise and signal to the Southern Star. I can see Paradise and my old companions smiling there. I see the faithless who fear us. I have to do this.

&gt; 05/15/10
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;ve done it. I&#39;ve done it. I watched my parishioners evaporate. Their stardust was flying through the ceiling. What a pity that it was only a minority, but that means that I have not yet aroused suspicion among the faithless. But I must act, for I feel they want to sabotage the Coming.
&gt; 
&gt; I must help. I feel like I must help. We&#39;re in danger. We must go to the sidereal ice to the south and I only know one way. If we can&#39;t go to Paradise, I&#39;ll make Paradise come to us. All for --Our Lord-- Our Star. ██████ ███ ██ ██&#39;██ austral.

**Addendum 2**: On 12/25/14 at 11:00 AM +12:00 UTC, a celestial body of unknown origin appeared over the Amundsen-Scott station. According to initial observations, it seems to share similar characteristics to Sigma Octantis, the current Southern Polar Star. Whether it is related to SCP-ES-105 and its potential classification as an anomaly is under investigation.
