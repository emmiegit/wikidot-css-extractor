**Item #:** SCP-4101

**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the circumstances of its location and operation, SCP-4101 is to remain integrated into Site-25 and, as such, requires no extra security than would already be appropriate for a Foundation site. However, knowledge of the existence of SCP-4101 itself is restricted to Level 4/4101 clearance or higher, with the exception of any Foundation personnel cleared for work on the Ouroboros Protocol. Regular maintenance of all associated systems of SCP-4101 is to take place weekly, with an allowed delay of no more than 48 hours. If any malfunctions of any components of SCP-4101 or its subsystems are suspected or identified, especially of those systems that are crucial to its continued function, testing is to be immediately halted until repairs have been made.

Regular testing with SCP-4101 is to occur once every 2 weeks. Any subject for testing is allowed, but testing involving classified material, material known to be associated with temporal/ontokinetic anomalies, or material that is known to be memetic, cognitohazardous, or infohazardous in nature is only to be carried out by personnel possessing Level 4/4101 clearance.  --This responsibility is currently assigned to Senior Researcher Mortimer Ericson.-- ##blue| __UPDATE (3/8/1999):__ Screening for candidates must, in addition to standard physical and mental aptitude measurements, must display no less than complete loyalty to the Foundation and its directives to mitigate the risk of an information breach resulting from the use of SCP-4101.##

For testing purposes, a series of digital data repositories, with individual storage capacities no fewer than 10 TB, are to remain at Site-25 at all times within SCP-4101. Due to the nature of SCP-4101, the only precautions necessary to access these repositories will be standard login credentials. These repositories are to contain as much historical text and documentation as feasible, with additions made as necessary when new information is gained through the use of SCP-4101. 

##blue|__UPDATE (3/8/1999):__ Due to further discoveries about SCP-4101&#39;s anomalous properties, no one individual may operate SCP-4101 more than 10 times without an interim period of at least 1 month. Any anomalous phenomena or manifestations occurring near individuals who have operated SCP-4101 are to be reported immediately, followed by the immediate barring of that individual from operating SCP-4101 for the foreseeable future.## See Addendum 2.

**Description:** SCP-4101 is a large mechanical device originally created by the Foundation in 1987 as part of Project Hindsight. Though it was once separate from Site-25, it has since been assimilated into the site&#39;s workings to allow for ease of its continued operation. As such, Site-25 is considered part of SCP-4101. The object consists of a dedicated power station (with a total output of 3 MW), a computer array complete with access to Foundation Intranet, a large amalgamation of different mechanisms responsible for SCP-4101&#39;s anomalous functions (some of which include standard supercomputer-level hardware and assorted clockwork mechanisms of varying complexity), and a large (about 500 m^^2^^) flat paved area in the center of SCP-4101 that serves as the control room, in the middle of which stands the control panel used for operating SCP-4101.

SCP-4101 (and Site-25 post-integration) demonstrates a poorly-understood form of causal immunity; while time itself passes normally within SCP-4101, it is utterly unaffected by any temporal anomalies that may affect its existence, creation, or operation. Mundane efforts in the present day to further test this property universally fail as well; --evidence of probability manipulation is currently being investigated-- (See Addendum 2). This effect extends to those within SCP-4101; as long as an individual remains within the facility, they share this immunity.

SCP-4101&#39;s principal effect is achieved whenever input is received through the control panel. The interface allows for the input of text strings of any size; complexity does not seem to skew the results to any significant degree, as due to the specifics of the [[[SCP-2719|conceptual experimentation and engineering]]] included as part of Project Hindsight, the input is understood through the intention of the operator. The only requirement is that the input must refer to an entity or object.

When input is given and SCP-4101 is activated, the main control room becomes inaccessible for a period of time up to and including, but not exceeding, five minutes. During this active period, the room undergoes extreme temporal distortion around the individual who activated SCP-4101 (hereafter referred to as the operator). The interior becomes a facsimile of the birthplace/place of origin of whatever the input was at the time when the input item came into being. The operator then experiences the entire existence of the input item in real time as illustrated to them by SCP-4101-1. 

SCP-4101-1 is a humanoid entity who varies in apparent age, gender, and race with every manifestation, but a description of the entity wearing a light brown, three-piece suit is consistent across every manifestation. When SCP-4101 is activated and the operator is displaced, SCP-4101-1 introduces itself and begins delivering the history of the input item. SCP-4101-1 describes itself as being an orator or teacher of sorts, with its descriptions and depictions being meticulously thorough, covering every major event and summarizing the minor events relating to the existence of the input item. SCP-4101-1 is universally described by operators as amicable, polite, and enthusiastic, frequently encouraging questions about the input item.

Despite the ability to move about freely in any manifested environment or location, direct interaction with anything in said environment is impossible, as physical contact cannot be achieved. However, items will manifest on the operator as necessary for their continued survival if a certain environment is normally inhospitable (such as SCUBA gear for oceanic environs, standard astronaut suits for space, etc.). During the active period, the operator witnesses the entire life or existence of the input item, starting with its birth/creation and ending with either its death/destruction or, where applicable, its continued existence in the present. 

Once the duration is over, SCP-4101-1 will say goodbye to the operator and thank them for their curiosity. The control room will then return to normal and the operator may exit. Any information gathered through the use of SCP-4101 will be retained with eidetic clarity, with memories showing extreme resistance to fading or erasure by amnestics. Further, any input item that has a memetic, cognitohazardous, or infohazardous property has that property bypassed in the operator&#39;s memory with no ill effects [[[SCP-055|barring a few]]] [[[SCP-3125|notable exceptions]]].

**__Abridged Testing Log:__**

[[collapsible hideLocation=&#34;both&#34; show=&#34;+ Open&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]

&gt; **Test 1: D-1745**
&gt; 
&gt; **Selected Remarks from SCP-4101-1:**
&gt; &#34;Hello there! Nice to meet you! Oh, wait. Probably weren&#39;t expecting me, were you? Sorry. I&#39;ll be your &#39;instructor&#39; for today, and boy, are we going to have some fun!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Look what a sweet child he was! Almost like a little angel! ...What&#39;s that? Oh! Why, yes! That is a bottle of whiskey in the father&#39;s hand. I&#39;m sure that will have no bearing on anything in the future.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Now, if you look here, you can notice the exact point where the child in him died. I hate to say it like that, but you look at him and tell me that he doesn&#39;t look harder after that. I tell you, that would be the last time I ever tried dating.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Oh my! Looks like all those years in the batting cages really paid off! Although... I&#39;m certain that&#39;s not how you&#39;re supposed to use a bat. Or a whiskey bottle. As you can see, though, that didn&#39;t stop him from acting like he&#39;d scored a homer.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;That has to be one of the most surprised looks I&#39;ve ever seen. Then again, I&#39;d also be dumbfounded if some shadowy organization picked me up so they could run experiments on me. Well, really, I&#39;d be even more surprised if I could see all that coming before it actually happened, because then I&#39;d be psychic, and then they&#39;d be picking me up for a different reason.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;And there he is now! Still just sitting in that cell while I&#39;m talking to you. Looks kind of bored, really. Maybe tell him I said hi?&#34;

&gt; **Test 2: George Washington**
&gt; 
&gt; **Selected Remarks from SCP-4101-1:**
&gt; &#34;Hey again! Good to see you! Always nice to have an eager student. I hope you&#39;re ready, because this one&#39;s special! Of course, I&#39;m sure you already knew that. Does &gt; this man really need an introduction?
&gt; 
&gt; ...Well, no, but I&#39;m going to give one anyway. Can&#39;t ever be too thorough!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;See? I can&#39;t tell you just how much that bugs me, but he never harmed a single leaf on that tree! He loved it like a family member! Ate its fruit every time it flowered! In fact, if he could hear me right now, he&#39;d be upset that people in the future - well, future relative to him, I suppose - are making things up about him to prove a point! I know plenty of other candidates that would be perfect for teaching the importance of honesty!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Now, if we&#39;re going to talk about honesty, I can honestly say that that is some getup. Now, I&#39;m not going to stand here and lecture someone about fashion during this history lesson, but... Hmm? Oh, his dentures? I&#39;m glad you noticed those. Yes, those are not normal human teeth. Some wood, some animal. Strange, eh? Aren&#39;t you glad people eventually learned that that&#39;s a silly idea?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Now, I must say, detailing conflict is never really fun for me, but boy, did he make it seem noble! Did you know that that river was approaching freezing levels when he and his men crossed it? It&#39;s true! All throughout that winter, he kept his men together as best he could, they were just straggling along, and you know what? He eventually led his country to victory! Yes, that half-frozen man you see before you now ended up victorious! Well, I&#39;m sure you already knew that, but it&#39;s still impressive, is it not?&#34;

&gt; **Test 12: Site-25**
&gt; 
&gt; **Selected Remarks from SCP-4101-1:**
&gt; &#34;Mortimer! So glad you&#39;re back! Congratulations on the promotion! Hmm... You look a little peaky today. Are you feeling alright? Getting enough sleep?
&gt; 
&gt; ...If you say so. Well, no matter. I&#39;m very flattered you decided to ask about little old me. Well, the site, but technically, the machine&#39;s a part of it, so it is what it is. I&#39;m sure you already have the documentation regarding the machine&#39;s construction, but I&#39;ll do what I can.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Now, this land was completely empty. No buildings, no major land features, not even any trees! Miles away from anything populated. Perfect clandestine location, wouldn&#39;t you say? But it gets better: then were planning on putting a big building there with security measures derived from anomalous technology! The perfect storm!
&gt; 
&gt; Of safety, that is.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;And as you can see, right after they installed the iron fencing, they set to work on the research and development wings. For you see, this would be one of the few sites under the control of the Foundation that would fully embrace and integrate their findings into their studies for the sake of progress! Of course, they would get pretty lonely in that regard, but this is something like their version of the Manhattan Project, so I can understand the caution. People don&#39;t just put up counterconceptual insulation for no reason.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Hmm? Oh, that insulation? You must not have been around for that. Well, what they did is they took what little information they had about anomalous metaphysics at the time and put a sort of geas on the place. Well, a modified type of geas. I&#39;d describe it as more of a waiver than a contract. The point of it was to shield the site and the fruit of its labors from any prying eyes. If you weren&#39;t allowed in, you weren&#39;t getting in, no exceptions. The concept of unauthorized access was quite literally incompatible with the concepts making up the site. Wild stuff.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;...Then, after it was all said and done, they made sure every gear and bolt and wire and board was in its place and had you come in to turn the key! And then here we are now! Looking at ourselves looking at ourselves looking at ourselves... Hmm. Perhaps I should&#39;ve taken away the display for this part. Oh, well. Interesting, though, is it not?&#34;

[[div style=&#34;color:white;&#34;]]
**Test 25: SCP-055**

**Selected Remarks from SCP-4101-1:**
&#34;Um... Really? I don&#39;t know how much I&#39;m going to be able to help with this, but... I&#39;ll try my best.&#34;

&#34;So as you can see - erm, well I think so, anyway - the brass frame really ties the whole thing together. It doesn&#39;t really do anything for the structural support or functionality of the thing, but it looks nice, doesn&#39;t it? You can see it, right?

...I could say anything I want right now, couldn&#39;t I?&#34;

&#34;Then the ghost got out and roamed around the site for a while, using the thing to stay invisible and... What&#39;s that? How? Well, it&#39;s kind of like that insulation we talked about before, only instead of interacting with concepts, it works with information. See, it targets a specific vector - namely, true information about itself - and siphons it back through the memories of people that view this information, clean out of their heads. Every memory ever formed about that thing? All contained within it. That what that ghost is; some poor soul... well, got his soul sucked into it whole.

...How does it work? Erm.. Well, I&#39;m... glad you asked! You see, first you take your locus and focus really hard on it...&#34;

&#34;...Now this next step is very important. You don&#39;t want to align the kittens improperly, or you&#39;ll get some pretty nasty backlash. You&#39;ll want some catnip to make them hold still...&#34;

&#34;...And once you&#39;ve given it as much voltage as you think it can handle, it should get up and running! You can cut off the power running to it after that; the ritual circle inside the mainframe should provide enough blue energy to keep it moving. Then just pick any type of information you want, assign the pointer to the memories of this information, and zip! Into the locus it goes!

If I may, what made you curious?

...Oh. I see. Well... good luck with that then, I suppose. Hope you&#39;ll be able to properly remember anything I just said and, if you do, you tell the others about it. I try to keep everything steady as best I can, but this thing is really powerful. I&#39;d be careful if I were you.&#34;

&gt; **Test 46: William Shakespeare**
&gt; 
&gt; **Selected Remarks from SCP-4101-1:**
&gt; &#34;Hello again, Mortimer. Boy, you visit me pretty often. Still taking it easy, I hope? I mean, I can still see you when you&#39;re not with me, but I wouldn&#39;t really be much use if I couldn&#39;t, now would I? Ah, well. No matter. I&#39;m sure you didn&#39;t come here so I could tell you how to live your life. You came here so I could tell you how this fine gentleman lived his life, and tell you I shall!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Now, you can see here how much his work meant to him. Why, on Venus and Adonis here - quite an underrated piece, in my honest opinion -  he spent many long nights trying to perfect his prose. Kind of sounds like someone I know, eh? Heh!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Ah, another great performance! Why, it even brought tears to his eyes, it was so beautiful. And it wasn&#39;t even his play! I must say, Mortimer, you picked an excellent subject this time around.
&gt; 
&gt; ...Hmm? Who&#39;s that in the second row? Oh! Why, that&#39;s Miss Anne Hathaway. She would later become his wife! ...Yes, I suppose she is quite fetching.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;What a romantic couple! I tell you, just walking around the streets of Stratford-upon-Avon is something I&#39;ve always wanted to do, but I don&#39;t really have anyone to do it with like they do!
&gt; 
&gt; ...What? What&#39;s wrong? Did I say something that upset you?
&gt; 
&gt; ...O-Okay. I&#39;ll put you back. Hopefully, I&#39;ll... see you again?&#34;

&gt; **Test 65: Edgar Allen Poe**
&gt; 
&gt; **Selected Remarks from SCP-4101-1:**
&gt; &#34;Mortimer! Well met, old chum. I&#39;ve seen how you&#39;ve been carrying on, and I - no, don&#39;t try and tell me otherwise! I want to help you take your mind off of it! Granted, this man&#39;s tale may not be the most uplifting in time&#39;s library, but I&#39;ll do my best!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Now this is quite the family reunion, is it not? A lovely spectacle. Everyone&#39;s so happy in each other&#39;s company. I must say, I don&#39;t have any real family of my own considering my, ahem, &#39;position&#39;, but if I did, and I wished to celebrate with them, then I would want that spectacle to look like this!
&gt; 
&gt; ...Why, yes, that is his cousin with him over there.
&gt; 
&gt; ...Yes, they are doing what it looks like they&#39;re doing. Care to move on? I know I would.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Another hard worker, as you can see. All he has is his paper, his utensil, and the light he uses to see by. Why, Annabelle Lee ended up being one of my personal favorites of his! Ah, Annabelle Lee? You&#39;ve not heard it? Oh, it&#39;s a wonderful - well, the tale itself is quite sad, but the composition is wonderful! So evocative! Look closely at his desk, you can see for yourself! Don&#39;t worry, he won&#39;t notice you.
&gt; 
&gt; ...My, you must like it as much as I do! It warms my heart to see people still able to be moved to tears by a good bit of poetry. I suppose employees of the Foundation must be cultured in some regard to get the positions that- What?
&gt; 
&gt; ...Oh. I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry. I... I thought perhaps...
&gt; 
&gt; Alright. Farewell for now, then.&#34;

[[div style=&#34;color:white;&#34;]]
**Test 89: SCP-631**
 
**Selected Remarks from SCP-4101-1:**
&#34;...Look, buddy. I&#39;m not going to sit here and tell you that what you&#39;re doing is wrong, but... I&#39;m not going to pretend that it&#39;s right, either.

...You insist then, huh? *sigh* Alright. It all began when some politician didn&#39;t want an uprising against him...&#34;

&#34;... So after many long years of development and tweaking, they finally got the killing machine they wanted, as you can see. Invisible and calm during the day, but horribly agitated at night, where they would feed on anyone... unfortunate enough to be near them. Of course... you&#39;d know all about that, eh?&#34;

&#34;Then the Foundation caught wind of these things and devised a way of catching them with minimal casualties. Of course, there are still casualties sometimes, because they couldn&#39;t catch all the buggers, and they&#39;re quite stubborn when it comes to staying alive, so if one, say, slips out of containment, some unfortunate researcher might get gobbled up by one. That is, to use a random example.

...Don&#39;t look at me like that! I know why you asked!

W-Wait! No, I&#39;m - I&#39;m sorry! I didn&#39;t mean to...

...Look, before you go... I&#39;m asking you as a friend... don&#39;t do anything you&#39;re going to regret, okay? Please? I&#39;ll still be here. I&#39;ll always be here. It&#39;s... it&#39;s not like I have anything better or more important to do. Teaching is... it&#39;s just what I do.

I just... Screw it. I think you should take a break. You&#39;re one of my greatest pupils, but... I don&#39;t want your studies to consume you. There&#39;s more to life than just me. If I do see you again... come back in one piece, will you?&#34;

**Addendum 1:** Creation and Classification

Project Hindsight was an attempt to create a device that would allow for a complete and thorough documentation of the history of humanity with the intention of preserving it from tampering by uncontained anomalies or the breach of contained anomalies. SCP-4101 is the sum total of Project Hindsight, acting as a crucial part of the Ouroboros Protocol. Multiple esoteric fields of study were exercised and even expanded during Project Hindsight and the creation of SCP-4101, including advanced metallurgy, engineering, and circuitry, applied thaumatology, and temporal manipulation and stabilization.

Classification of SCP-4101 as an anomalous object resulted from preliminary testing revealing the existence of SCP-4101-1. Once a larger base of knowledge regarding the device&#39;s function was accumulated and its potential for use was underscored by this knowledge, it was shortly classed as Thaumiel. In light of SCP-4101-1&#39;s apparent willingness to cooperate with Foundation efforts to more effectively chronicle history, Project Hindsight is considered a success.

[[collapsible show=&#34;PLEASE SUBMIT 5/4101 CREDENTIALS TO VIEW FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE OUROBOROS PROTOCOL&#34; hide=&#34;ACCESS GRANTED&#34;]]

The Ouroboros Protocol is an operation planned to take effect soon in the future, preparations for which are an ongoing undertaking occurring throughout all echelons of the Foundation. Once activated, it is an effort to continuously assure the Foundation&#39;s continued existence and operation through bootstrapping, retrocausal activity, and ontological insulation. Project Hindsight was one of the first few phases of the Protocol, setting the groundwork for the more labor and resource-intensive stages. For further information about the Ouroboros Protocol, please see Document ███████.

--Following the completion of SCP-4101 and its classification, preparations to enact the Ouroboros Protocol are being made nominally.-- Following the events of Incident 4101-1, preparations to enact the Ouroboros Protocol are halted indefinitely. See Addendum 2.

**Addendum 2:** Incident 4101-1

On 03/8/1999, after routine testing of SCP-4101, Senior Researcher Ericson entered his office to log the results and didn&#39;t exit for three hours. During this time, RAISA personnel were alerted to potential antimemetic contamination in his workstation. Security personnel were alerted to this and sent to his room. Upon their arrival, they observed Ericson sitting at his desk staring at his sidearm, visibly distressed and unresponsive. As he was taken to the medical wing for processing, personnel further observed that his personal audio log used for research notes was still open and logged into on his computer. After perusing its contents, personnel notified the Director of Site-25 of heretofore undocumented anomalous properties of SCP-4101. Following this discovery, the containment procedures were shortly revised. An abridged version of the contents of the log are transcribed below:

[[collapsible hideLocation=&#34;both&#34; show=&#34;+ Open&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]

&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt;  
&gt; //5/24/1987//
&gt; This is Researcher Ericson speaking, marking the first activation of the object now designated SCP-4101. I must say, I&#39;m very excited about the opportunities that this machine will provide. Already, the thing works exactly as intended; I told it I wanted to hear about the D-Class in the cell two rooms over, and it took me to some hospital.
&gt; 
&gt; One thing I //didn&#39;t// anticipate was the presence of... some person. Well, I mean, of //course// there were people there, but this one clearly didn&#39;t belong there. His suit made him stick out like a sore thumb. Of course, though the others didn&#39;t notice me, he did. Even said hello. Explained that he was my &#39;teacher&#39; for the day.
&gt; 
&gt; I was worried, but he quickly added that he was here to tell me all about Carl[[footnote]]The name of the D-Class personnel used during this test.[[/footnote]]. I humored him, and he took me through his whole life. Everything seemed so... so //real//. His birth, his childhood, his... murders, his incarceration. Right up to his transfer to Site-25 and being put in that cell. Then he just thanked me and left.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;d like to say I can&#39;t wait until I forget what I saw - I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen someone so vicious with a baseball bat - but that&#39;s just it. I can&#39;t. The images just... stick in my mind. Whenever I think about them, every sense is just flooded by the memory as if I were witnessing it again. The official transcripts of the construction of the thing say that the core functions of the machine are based off of &#39;the pioneered scientific field of conceptual entanglement and anchoring&#39;, whatever that means. I&#39;d guess that&#39;s what I&#39;m experiencing. I didn&#39;t just see the past; the past is... //in// my head or something.
&gt; 
&gt; This machine is incredible, but... I&#39;d be lying if I said I wasn&#39;t worried.

&gt; //6/8/1987//
&gt; Just another efficacy test. This time, we went for a popular historical figure. I suggested George Washington, and that seemed to go over well. I must say, I&#39;m no history buff or anything like that, but seeing all those battles with my own eyes was something else.
&gt; 
&gt; That guy seemed to enjoy telling it to me, too. Kept wanting me to ask questions, as if he wanted me to drink in every detail. Reminded me of a friend of mine who always had some piece of artwork to show me. This guy wanted to see nothing short of awe from me.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I&#39;d say he got it... but he also got some concern. I&#39;m not sure what, but something still isn&#39;t sitting right with me. Hmm... I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m probably just saying that because of the date.
&gt; 
&gt; ...Today would have been Annabelle&#39;s 30th birthday.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; ...Happy birthday, Annabelle. Not a day goes by when I don&#39;t think about you.

&gt; Another day, another musty old history book to cross-reference. I swear, if I&#39;d known just how many years of ancient, antiquated drivel I&#39;d have to sit through in the name of progress, I probably would have requested to be transferred to a different project.
&gt; 
&gt; Still, Senior Researcher does have a nice ring to it, now that I&#39;m saying for the first time //since// my promotion, so maybe it&#39;s worth it.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, SCP-4101-1 was enthusiastic as ever. She - well, she was a &#39;she&#39; this time - but she looked overjoyed to see me again. Made the life of some Christian monk from the 16th century seem downright lively. Every time I come back to that machine, I remember just how much I enjoy -1&#39;s &#39;seminars&#39;, if it really is a teacher.
&gt; 
&gt; I must say, though, I&#39;m not looking forward to the next session, even with its enthusiasm.
&gt; 
&gt; ...Another sad Valentine&#39;s Day. Hoo-ray.

&gt; //2/15/1988//
&gt; Okay, something&#39;s wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; There must be something more to that machine. The information it gave me is as strong as it ever was, so the long-term projections are happening just as predicted, but... there&#39;s something else. Something that has me worried.
&gt; 
&gt; I never asked it about myself.
&gt; 
&gt; Last night, I had a strange dream. Rather murky, couldn&#39;t make out many details, but I definitely remember my mother being there. Just an overwhelming feeling of contentment washing through me, and then my alarm blaring me awake. When I reached over to turn it off, I noticed something on my nightstand that //certainly// wasn&#39;t there before: a bottle. A //baby// bottle. Freshly full to the brim.
&gt; 
&gt; As soon as I saw it, I knew I didn&#39;t even have to taste it to know where that milk came from.
&gt; 
&gt; I checked my doors, windows, everything, but nothing had gotten in that I could see. I checked the cameras I&#39;d installed - nothing. I&#39;m... I can never be too sure nowadays after that... that //[[[SCP-631|thing]]]// took my Annabelle.
&gt; 
&gt; Speaking of... Happy Valentine&#39;s Day, Annabelle. Even though I&#39;m scared, I&#39;m glad //you// don&#39;t have to deal with this. 
&gt; 
&gt; Heh.

&gt; The dreams are getting worse.
&gt; 
&gt; I thought they&#39;d mostly subsided, but just this last night, I had a //vivid// dream about my first high school prom, and woke up to Annabelle&#39;s dress draped over the headboard. Now I&#39;m getting //really// worried, but... I&#39;m afraid to tell anyone.
&gt; 
&gt; I... I //can&#39;t// tell anyone. If it turns out I&#39;m affected by an anomaly, even //compromised// by an anomaly...
&gt; 
&gt; ...No. Out of the question.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; ...It&#39;s the machine. I know it. I remember that it does what it does because of some metaphysical mechanics or what have you...
&gt; 
&gt; ...Could it be a side effect?

&gt; Dreams are getting more vivid, more real. Dreamt about our wedding day. Large slice of cake was waiting for me. Had our two little figurines sitting on top. I&#39;ve worked for the Foundation for almost 10 years now, and I&#39;ve yet to see a concept so strong, it... &#39;makes&#39; things.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; ...At least it tasted good.

&gt; Dreamt about our... our consummation. Woke up naked, covered in sweat, and... messy. Candles, still lit, sitting on every surface they could fit. I swear I could smell her in the air.
&gt; 
&gt; ...Whatever&#39;s doing this, I hate it. I feel like it&#39;s... //mocking// me. Can&#39;t you just leave her alone? Fate already took her; why do you need to keep reminding me!?

&gt; ...I think I&#39;m going insane.
&gt; 
&gt; I walked into my office this morning and found a pink envelope sitting in front of my computer next to an apple pie. Before I even read the letter, I winced. I already knew what was coming. She always //did// like baking...
&gt; 
&gt; It was just a card. It read, &#34;Happy late Valentine&#39;s Day, pudding! Sorry I couldn&#39;t make it in time. Love you! XO- Annabelle.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; ...She&#39;s been dead for 14 years now, almost 15. But the pie was still warm.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; ...Either she baked it with so much love that I can taste it, or there is something //seriously// wrong with me.

&gt; Turns out it&#39;s not just good memories life wants to throw back in my face to torment me.
&gt; 
&gt; I dreamed about that night... that horrible, horrible night. The Foundation agents knocking on my door, telling me that while Annabelle was on a business trip, she got... //devoured// by that monster. Me begging them to let me keep her, keep the memory of her... The memory is all I&#39;d have...
&gt; 
&gt; Then I woke up. My window had been smashed open, and there were claw marks all over it. If I were to make a guess, I&#39;d say that another one just flew out to join the world. Thank God - or whatever passes for him - I sleep with my bedside lamp on.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; ...Well, on the plus side, I&#39;m not sleeping for a while, so that should mean no more trinkets, apparitions, or... monsters anytime soon.

&gt; //3/8/1999//
&gt; I get it now. I should have known all this time.
&gt; 
&gt; I figured I&#39;d ask the machine. Don&#39;t know why the thought hadn&#39;t occurred to me sooner. Maybe I just... didn&#39;t want any more reminders, and using a machine //made// for that specific purpose wouldn&#39;t have helped. Whatever.
&gt; 
&gt; I went in and typed in &#39;Annabelle Ericson&#39;. No hospital, no hometown, no nothing. Just blackness.
&gt; @@@@
&gt; @@@@
&gt; And her.
&gt; @@@@
&gt; @@@@
&gt; ...Why did it have to look like her?
&gt; @@@@
&gt; @@@@
&gt; It clearly //wasn&#39;t// her; the suit gave that away real quick. Figures that it knew what I wanted.
&gt; 
&gt; I asked it, &#34;What is all of this about? The dreams, the ghosts, everything! Why won&#39;t you leave me alone?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; It just looked at me like I was a wounded dog and said, &#34;&#39;Leave you alone? I&#39;d love to, buddy, but think about this. I love our chats; it makes my day - well, so to speak - whenever you come back to learn something more. But it&#39;s still //you// every time. You come back to the past week after week after week, and that&#39;s not even talking about what you do when you&#39;re not with me. I&#39;m sorry, bud, but how do you expect the past to stay away from you when you won&#39;t stop living in it?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; I said, &#34;What would //you// know!? What would you know about living in the past!? Do you know what I wouldn&#39;t give to have the past //not// follow me in every waking moment? When every day is a new reminder of what I&#39;ve lost, when every day is a new reminder of what I must do, of why I must do my part to contain anomalies like //you//, what would you know about that kind of pain?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; It said, &#34;Well, I should think you would already know the answer to that, pal.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; I asked, &#34;...Fine. But what do you want me to do, then? Forget about her?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; ...I&#39;d say I&#39;ll never forget what it said, but the machine already made sure of that. Right before the machine put me back, that... locus, that //creature// in the suit grabbed my shoulders and looked me straight in the eyes. The eyes weren&#39;t Annabelle&#39;s. They were still kind, still sympathetic... but they weren&#39;t Annabelle&#39;s.
&gt; @@@@
&gt; @@@@
&gt; @@@@
&gt; ...It said, &#34;I&#39;m not saying that you should never look back, but I //am// saying that it&#39;s impolite to stare.&#34;

In light of this new information, additions to the Description of SCP-4101 are currently pending following review by the Director of Site-25. Upon a more thorough search of his quarters, security personnel found a small, digital device of poorly-understood function; at present, it is theorized that this device is what allowed Senior Researcher Ericson to conceal certain sections of the testing logs from sight and preventing suspicion from being raised. When this device was located, it appeared to have been powered off manually, which likely allowed its influence to be detected. Classification as SCP-4101-2 is currently pending.

After Senior Researcher Ericson has been processed and debriefed, he is to be amnesticized, demoted, and transferred out of Site-25, with any further work of his closely monitored for anomalous phenomena/active subterfuge. Lingering remnants of information are to be expected, but their effects should be negligible. Despite these actions, his next assignment will take place in addition to regular scheduled visits to an appointed psychologist, where he is expected to make a full recovery.

Further investigation into the nature of SCP-4101-1 and the specific property or properties of SCP-4101 that allow for its manifestation is ongoing.
