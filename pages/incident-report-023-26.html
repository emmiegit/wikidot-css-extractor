**SCP involved:** [[[SCP-023]]]

**Personnel involved:** Dr. ████████, 5 D-Class personnel

**Date:** ██/██/██ - ██/██/██

**Location:** Site ██

**Description:**

In an attempt to curtail the danger posed by SCP-023, Dr. ████████ has approved the removal of both 023&#39;s eyes and teeth. Immediately after both its eyes were removed, SCP-023 breached security by vanishing completely. SCP-023 was re-obtained on a stretch of Interstate ███ at 4:37 P.M., and brought back into containment, where D-Class personnel finished pulling out its teeth. While the total number of civilians exposed to SCP-023 during this period is unknown, death record monitoring has tied 9 civilian deaths to this incident.

Timestamps confirmed over the course of the next 48 hours that SCP-023 vanished only while the sun was visible in the sky from outside Site ██.

**Addendum-023-026-1:**

As of ██/██/████, Dr. ████████ has been suspended pending disciplinary review for contributing to, if not being directly responsible for, Incident-023-026. Dr. ████ is now in charge of SCP-023. 

//The increased difficulties in containment that have been incurred as a result of Dr. ████████ should serve to remind all personnel of The Foundation&#39;s purpose. Secure, Contain, and Protect. Research, experimentation, convenience, and even the safety of Foundation personnel are secondary concerns.  We are not working to protect ourselves.//

O5-██

**Addendum-023-026-2:** A total of █ bodies with a time of death exactly one year after Incident 023-26 have been identified as consistent with SCP-023 exposure.</textarea></pre>
