[[include component:image-block name=lamp2.jpg|caption=SCP-2660.]]

**Item #:** SCP-2660

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2660 is currently held in a standard containment chamber, with an additional set of doors to prevent line-of-sight access to connecting corridors. 

Personnel may not take any physical or digital notes while testing SCP-2660, and must instead verbally report all test results to the designated test director (currently Dr. Gently).

All information about SCP-2660 is currently restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance, or personnel approved to work with SCP-2660. **(Updated: See Addendum 2660-1)**

**Description:** SCP-2660 is a ceramic table lamp which exhibits a self-clarifying infohazard. Awareness of one of SCP-2660&#39;s physical properties causes the observer to slowly gain awareness of all its physical properties; this process takes between three hours and two days to complete.

For example, persons viewing only a small portion of SCP-2660&#39;s surface can identify the object as a lamp. Images that have been extensively edited or color shifted are also prone to this effect, e.g., a color shifted photo still allows the subject to identify SCP-2660 as black and white. All information created involving SCP-2660 is persistent; it cannot be expunged, redacted, or lied about in any way.

Electronic text records regarding SCP-2660 cannot be erased or edited as to expunge data, and will instantly revert to unedited form if this is attempted. Messages written on paper regarding SCP-2660 will, if erased, gradually reappear on the paper over the course of 3-6 hours. Memories regarding SCP-2660 will never be forgotten, and cannot be erased by amnestic treatment.

Persons with a line of sight to SCP-2660[[footnote]]&#34;Line of sight to SCP-2660&#34; is defined as the ability to draw an unobstructed line between any point on the person or object in question to any point on SCP-2660&#39;s surface.[[/footnote]] experience the sensation of hearing a repeating beat, described as sequence of one long note followed by two short notes, accompanied by a constant buzzing. Objects or persons with a line of sight to SCP-2660 are affected by an additional anomalous effect, designated SCP-2660-1. SCP-2660-1 only affects objects with line of sight contact to SCP-2660, and only for the duration of that contact.

SCP-2660-1&#39;s effect varies from each object tested, although similar objects usually exhibit the same effect. All SCP-2660-1 affected items are subject to SCP-2660&#39;s self-clarifying effect.

In testing it was found that a human affected by SCP-2660-1, when asked to identify an item experiencing SCP-2660-1, consistently give identical answers.[[footnote]]Humans who speak different languages will give consistent responses within their own language, synonymous with other-language responses.[[/footnote]] These answers as reported by D-10748 are found in the &#34;identification&#34; column.

||~ Item(s) tested ||~ Identification ||~ Notes||
|| D-10748 || &#34;A person.&#34; || D-10748, previously uncooperative and aggressive, shows a considerable change in character, becoming compliant and calm nearly instantaneously.||

|| &#34;Swiss Army&#34; multitool || &#34;A tool.&#34; || The multitool is able to be operated as a knife to cut a length of rope, despite lacking a knife attachment. Camera footage shows D-10748 moving the tool in a cutting motion, and the rope behaving as if cut by an invisible knife.||
|| Copy of Emily Bronte&#39;s &#34;Wuthering Heights&#34;|| &#34;A book.&#34; || D-10748 is able to complete the novel in 42 minutes. D-10748 scores perfectly on a short test of plot knowledge, but is unable to describe the novel in a metaphorical way.||
|| Copy, in Russian, of Fyodor Dostoevsky&#39;s &#34;Crime and Punishment&#34; || &#34;A book.&#34; || D-10748 completes the novel in 45 minutes. Test results are as above.||
|| Print of Leonardo da Vinci&#39;s &#34;Mona Lisa&#34; || &#34;An image.&#34; || D-10748 is able to describe the woman depicted in the painting in detail, but is unable to comment on the colors or techniques used.||

In layman&#39;s terms, the SERS functions by siphoning reality from its surroundings and centralizing it inside the device. The effects reverse upon deactivation.[[/footnote]] || &#34;A drain.&#34; || No changes in local reality detected. ||

SCP-2660 was recovered following a Foundation raid on a known headquarters of the [[[church-of-the-broken-god-hub|Maxwellist sect]]] of the Church of the Broken God[[footnote]]While many orders of the Church of the Broken God believe in a deity with a fractured physical body, the Maxwellist sect worships a deity composed of information and believes that this deity manifests through human connectivity. As such, the internet and other global communication networks are of particular interest to Maxwellist worshippers.[[/footnote]]. While the raid was otherwise successful, it was suspected by memetic analysts that [[[task-forces#nu-7|MTF Nu-7 &#34;Hammer Down&#34;]]] may have been exposed to cognitohazardous material during the operation. Cautionary amnestic treatments were utilized, but subsequent treatment evaluations revealed that some memories remained, all dealing with a lamp briefly spotted in the center of a &#34;worship&#34; hall. The object was secured and designated SCP-2660.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Show Interview Log 7154&#34; hide=&#34;Hide Interview Log 7154&#34;]]
The following interview log has been attached to this document due to relevance to the continued containment of SCP-2660. 
&gt; **Interviewed:** POI-7154, former head of the raided Maxwellist site.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Sandu
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Interview was conducted in a specially constructed Faraday cage used to interview objects or persons that emit moderate to severe amounts of electromagnetic radiation. Due to the nature of modifications on POI-7154&#39;s person to allow for connectivity and collaboration with fellow cultists, use of this chamber was authorized. The interview was conducted 14 days after initial object recovery.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sandu:** Sarah Richards, henceforth referred to as POI-7154. You were found at the Maxwellist camp in Hyderabad. Our intel indicates that you were the head of this particular branch. Is this true?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-7154:** Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sandu:** How many others were working under you?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-7154:** They&#39;re here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sandu:** I&#39;ve been informed that you&#39;ve got some hardware in your head that lets you talk to your friends. That doesn&#39;t work here, miss.
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-7154:** There is no need to use hardware, anymore. My people, we have... transcended. I can feel them. They&#39;re nearby.
&gt; 
&gt; [Note: At this point, four additional cultists were being interviewed within the same wing of the site as this interview.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sandu:** How do you &#34;feel them&#34; without hardware to send and receive messages? According to our x-rays, which lit up like a Christmas tree, by the way, you have several transmitting devices implanted into your cranium. Devices which are currently non-functional.
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-7154:** There is no need for hardware. We are connected through the unreality. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sandu:** How are you connected? What is &#34;unreality&#34;?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-7154:** You are in unreality right now. The lies, the expunged, the hidden? The unreality is pervasive, and you perpetuate it. SCP-2660.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sandu:** That designation is classified.
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-7154:** Don&#39;t you see? Classification, redaction, it&#39;s all useless. The omnipresent is the truth. It has come from the true place, and it is pure, unbridled information, a connection between all who have beheld it. The Signal. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sandu:** Your Signal... your god.
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-7154:** Doctor Gabriel Sandu. Your people, you have it now. So long as you have it, it will become a part of you. It will unite you, as it has united my people.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sandu:** And what happens when we are &#34;united&#34;?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-7154:** Then we pierce the veil. All of us. Together.
&gt; 
&gt; [POI-7154 begins tapping the table in a pattern similar to the vibrations originating from SCP-2660. Dr. Sandu is quietly informed of the risk of cognitohazardous influence.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sandu:** This interview is... concluded.
&gt; 
&gt; [POI-7154 does not speak, instead increasing the intensity of the pounding as the interview is concluded.]
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Addendum 2660-1:** Following the events of Interview 7154, all persons who had previously been directly exposed to SCP-2660 were detained and placed in quarantine pending further review of SCP-2660&#39;s containment procedures. Dr. Sandu was detained following an attempt to break protocol and communicate with affected persons. As the limits of what constitutes &#34;knowledge&#34; of SCP-2660 are not fully understood, all information on the current status of quarantined persons is hereby restricted to personnel with express clearance from Level 4 personnel of the Foundation memetics department.
