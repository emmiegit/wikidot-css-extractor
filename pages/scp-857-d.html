&gt; --**Result:** SCP-857 crushed by Dr Bridge.--
&gt; --**New Form:** As yet unknown--

&gt; //Just ask next time, damn. - Agent Yoric//
&gt; **Addendum:** On ██ Oct 2011, SCP-857 was discovered to be inhabiting a bronze goblet in the [REDACTED] Museum at ████████, approximately 250 km away from Area-354.
&gt; 
&gt; **Date:** ██ Oct 2011
&gt; **Object used:** [[[SCP-914]]]
&gt; **Result:** SCP-857 processed on &#34;rough&#34; settings. Output was a small pile of bronze fragments.

&gt; **Result:** SCP-857 successfully fed to SCP-646 during weekly feeding.
&gt; **New Form:** A pitcher owned by Dr. Xander
&gt; //One of you had better replace that. - Dr. Xander//
&gt; 
&gt; **Date:** ██ Oct 2011
&gt; **Object used:** [[[SCP-447]]]
&gt; **Result:** SCP-857 covered in SCP-447. Incinerated after effect was noted to persist.
&gt; **New Form:** A wine glass owned by Agent Tann
&gt; //Well... the slime always seems to do what you need it to do. Thought that would work. - Dr. Bridge//

&#34;Why do you look so gloomy?&#34; said Harmon as Dr. Muse took a seat at SCP-946 with SCP-857.

She plunked the wine glass onto the table and gave it a long glare.

&#34;I //loathe// zis object.&#34;

&#34;What&#39;s the matter with it?&#34; Garcian said. &#34;It&#39;s a rather nice glass.&#34;

&#34;It is ze worst SCP object.&#34;

&#34;Tell us of it, then.&#34;

Dr. Muse sighed.

&#34;Well, it apparently believes it is God or somesing like it, and it does miracles but sometimes it does not, and occasionally it does &#39;orrid sings to sinners and when its form is destroyed ze effect travels to anozzer cup, and ze containment procedures called for an alchemist and I am not a containment specialist so &#39;oo am I to question such sings, but anyway it is simply too much trouble to keep around, and just as I was sinking zis I got a call from one of ze Overseers and &#39;e informed me zat I am allowed to attempt to destroy it but after days and days I just //cannot//. It is ze worst.&#34;

Harmon and Garcian nodded slowly, then turned to face each other.

&gt; **Date:** ██ Oct 2011
&gt; **Object used:** [[[SCP-946]]]
&gt; **Result:** SCP-857 was described by Dr. Muse to 946-1 and 946-2. After 946-1 and 946-2 agreed SCP-857 was &#34;absurd&#34;, SCP-857 ceased to exist.
&gt; //...I see. - O5-8//
