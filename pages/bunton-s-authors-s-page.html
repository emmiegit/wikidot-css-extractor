    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>{{In 1901, the Serpent’s Hand Women’s Advocacy (changed in 1974 to the “Women’s Advocacy of Library Patronage”) was founded by former suffragette M. Walsh, with the intent of supporting female Hand members – who were, at that time, under-represented in certain factions. The case was, unfortunately, that a large proportion of the organisation’s academic parts were rooted in the developed world: particularly, the universities and mystical associations of the time.}}

{{In the period between the guild’s inception and the Rediscovery, the Women’s Advocacy served as a union and aid to those women affected by the culture of era, and became immensely popular.}}

{{Throughout the latter part of the proceeding sixty years, the Advocacy became more obscure. Its membership was maintained primarily as a tradition, and its main purpose became to act as an easy way for certain scholars and the like to reliably call upon others when necessary.}}

{{It was, however, not entirely without merit: several research projects and collaborations were undergone by individuals who had come to know each other through various meetings related to the group. Not to mention the fact that, upon the re-proliferation of the Ways, the Hand accepted a great deal of non-human joiners, some of whom came from a culture that oppressed some form of female-analogue. At time of writing, at least a quarter of Advocates consist of fluid anglers, who are widely thought physically inept by their solid counterparts.}}

{{Despite everything the Advocacy has gone through, the organisation remains prevalent, its members numbering in the dozens. Though it is no longer the powerful and representative party it once was, many a noted work has been produced by those with a hand in it.}}
