Events are by far the most important part of stories. With the sheer amount of them, however, it&#39;s very easy to get lost in the mess. Below you can find a comprehensive timeline of all bigger events of the canon, sorted chronologically. The most important events are indicated by a bolded **[I]**.

Simply put, though, most of From 120&#39;s Archives follows real-life history with paranormal events sprinkled throughout it. The only exception to this is the state of the world following the collapse of the Veil on 25/11/2021; everything after that event is entirely out of sync with reality and should be considered alternate history.
