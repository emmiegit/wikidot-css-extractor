+ Crash&#39;s flashy art-dash

**Hey guys! Welcome to my art hub!** Here is where I will post all my SCP related art.
I hope to use this to draw more often and improve more, so I hope this shines through.

[[tabview]]
[[tab Fanart of singular SCPs]]
This is for all Fanart focussing on singular articles and/or my favourite aspects of them.

I will try to do mostly newer SCP&#39;s/SCP&#39;s I have not seen a lot of fanart of, although I won&#39;t rule out the occasional &#34;classic&#34;. Overall it is just based on my favourites though. :D

**By the way**: If you have any suggestions for underappreciated SCPs or are an author that would like to have some art I&#39;d be very happy to take a look at them and see what I can do! :D



[[collapsible show=&#34;Taboo&#34; hide=&#34; Just repeat the last syllable of any name you use one additional time for everytime you use it! Tabooboo Taboobooboo Tabooboobooboo. &#34;]]

To start things off with number **1**, here is an SCP that I think about on an at least weekly basis: [[*user PeppersGhost]]&#39;s [http://www.scp-wiki.net/taboo Woods Beyond Name].

[[Collapsible show=&#34;4104&#34; hide=&#34; What will be left after he did whatever it is he wants to do?&#34;]]

Number **2** is [[*user KrySalems]]&#39; [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4104 &#34;He’s lying to you all.&#34;]. A cold and eerie story about nothing.

[[image https://i.imgur.com/SPmasSr.gif width=&#34;600px&#34;]]

This is my first time really using a gif in an artistic way so I hope it came out well.

[[Collapsible show=&#34;4444&#34; hide=&#34; Tbh the only thing I knew about Gore before this was the Southpark depiction. &#34;]]

And here goes number **3**! [[*user djkaktus]]&#39; [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4444 Bush vs Gore]!

[[Collapsible show=&#34;3596&#34; hide=&#34; Go, Go SJCAS! doesn&#39;t roll off the tongue too well...]]

Number **4** is a cute story about superheroes and Saturday mornings: [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3596 SCP-3596] by [[*user IAmTheOoga]]!

[[collapsible show=&#34;4005&#34; hide=&#34;It&#39;s an extra dimensional anglerfish ain&#39;t it?&#34;]]

Number **5** is [[*user Tufto]]&#39;s [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4005 SCP-4005]. This one was especially interesting to me because it was described as an optimistic, &#34;happy-end&#34;-kinda story when to me it only grew more and more uncomfortable and scary.

[[collapsible show=&#34;4051&#34; hide=&#34;Poor Rainer.&#34;]]


Number **6** is special to me because my first idea for an SCP, before joining the site, was: &#34;a guy that could produce anything out of the pockets of any coats he wore&#34;. And this is basically that concept but realized in proportions and with a complexity, I would have never been able to. It is [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4051 SCP-4051] by [[*user Nagiros]].

[[collapsible show=&#34;3165&#34; hide=&#34; Who needs foxy girls when you can have wolfy ones?&#34;]]

Number **7** took the scary murder monster and made it not only interesting but also kinda cute. I wanted to give her some (misshapen) lipstick but it only ever looked like blood. :( 
And yeah I can do colour too! :P This is [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3165 Dog Teeth] by [[*user Dog Teeth]]!

Number **8** is [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4377 Fight! Fight for the Man of the People!] by [[*user MaliceAforeThought]]! Funny, weird and fucking annoying to draw! (Drawn in barely an hour so excuse the sketchiness) :D (and before you ask, yes it is exactly 48 people if you count them right.)

[[collapsible show=&#34;4966&#34; hide=&#34;Munchies!&#34;]]

Number **9** is [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4966 Tubbioca: Devourer of Souls, Consumer of Secrets, Lord of Munchies] by [[*user Deadly Bread]]! We got Minecraft Tubb, goop Tubb, scrunched Tubb, ball Tubb, flat Tubb, weird Tubb, //s//e//x//x//y// Tubb, long cat Tubb and finally: normal Tubb.


[[image https://i.imgur.com/QNRZbkh.png width=&#34;600px&#34;]]

But wait, there&#39;s more!
------
We got Ouroborous tubby, baseball tubby, infinite tubby, angel tubby, even sexier tubby, looooooooooooong tubby, cat tubby, anime tubby, 999 tubby, boot tubby (good bed) and finally knot tubby!

Number **10** is [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3785 Jasper&#39;s Hill] by [[*user djkaktus]]! Starts as a slasher movie, ends with space octopus. What more could you want?

[[collapsible show=&#34;3540&#34; hide=&#34;Queereaper&#34;]]

Number **11** is [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3540 Don&#39;t queer the reaper!] by [[*user MayDay]]! 
I started drawing this and wanted to do them, standing in their door with a bowl of sweets, but then it hit me. American Gothic. This is one of those rare moments where I am just really proud to have come up with this because that title and the parody is just way too perfect.
