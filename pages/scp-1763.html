**Item #:** SCP-1763

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The stairwell leading into the basement containing SCP-1763 is to be kept closed at all times, and guarded from the inside by two security personnel. A clearance level of 2 or higher is required for entrance. Personnel interested in viewing video records of performance incidents are to contact Dr. Howder.

**Description:** SCP-1763 is a Class-4 (reclassified from Class-3 following incident 1763-64) interdimensional portal[[footnote]]Similar to that observed in [[[SCP-1986]]].[[/footnote]] located in the basement of ████ West 38th Street, New York City, NY.[[footnote]]Independent shows not necessarily associated with Broadway Theater are common in this area of New York City.[[/footnote]] At the time SCP-1763 was discovered, 76 folding chairs had been set up facing SCP-1763, in a formation typical of a proscenium space. While there is no box office, a metal bowl is placed on a small table at the entrance to the seating area with the label &#34;donations&#34;. Any objects placed in the bowl will disappear at exactly one hour following the end of any performance incident. One hour before a performance incident, 40 to 70 programs will appear beside the bowl, detailing the performance that will take place along with a brief summary of the social context of the performance and an overlook of the organization performing the piece. Throughout Foundation containment of SCP-1763, only one organization has performed; however, several programs indicate that previous &#34;companies&#34; have made use of the venue.

The reality visible within SCP-1763 appears to be a proscenium-arch-type stage, with two permanent sets of curtains[[footnote]]These curtains are rarely used, as per trends among contemporary theatre.[[/footnote]]. The theatre is mainly constructed from wood[[footnote]]which will typically be painted over in order to match with the current production[[/footnote]], with metal scaffolding above the stage[[footnote]]Note that this is exclusively used for prop work; no lighting units are apparent.[[/footnote]]. This stage area is designated SCP-1763-1.

SCP-1763-1 is currently used as a theatre venue by a large company designated SCP-1763-A. This company will perform on a monthly basis, with limited runs during the last full week of the month from Monday to Saturday. Shows typically start at 18:00 and run until 20:00 - 22:00, with a 15 - 20 minute intermission. There may also be a matinee on Fridays or Saturdays at 2:00. Alongside these regular performances, SCP-1763-A may also produce children&#39;s shows, stand-up comedy, or improvised theatre [[footnote]]Due to SCP-1763&#39;s nature, there is no audience participation in this form of improvisation.[[/footnote]].

Members of SCP-1763-A show numerous anomalous properties. SCP-1763-A-1[[footnote]]The director of most productions.[[/footnote]] is an incorporeal entity which operates through mechanical hands extending inwards from off-stage, SCP-1763-A-5, -6, and -12 are entirely skeletal, SCP-1763-A-7 and -8 possess two sets of arms, and SCP-1763-A-13 appears to be a member of //Homo neanderthalensis//. Players may or may not be type-casted depending on their appearance.

Construction of the set begins two weeks before opening, with dress rehearsals occurring three days before opening. Pieces performed by SCP-1763-A vary widely. Approximately one quarter of all performances correspond to existing plays. Thus far, the perceived cost of a production and the frequencies of production have not changed with audience attendance or the amount donated.

Attempts to interact with the space within SCP-1763 have so far been unsuccessful. Tunneling around and into SCP-1763&#39;s apparent space leads to a mirror image of SCP-1763.

**Addendum:** Samples of productions:

&gt; **Performance Incident #:** 1
&gt; **Performance:** //&#34;Ghoul or Girl&#34;// by &#34;Glashmer Haghjsd&#34;
&gt; **Program Description:** A look at the life of a young, female Ghoul as she struggles to find her identity in a world of four genders. Body image problems, red squirting, and how parents are expected to deal with these issues are some of the numerous issues addressed in this piece.
&gt; **Observations:** The four genders acknowledged in the play are male, female, &#34;Hansi&#34;, and &#34;Frog&#34;. SCP-1763-A-3 vomited an orange fluid onto the stage during the second act.

&gt; **Performance Incident #:** 4
&gt; **Performance:** //Waiting for Godot// by Samuel Beckett
&gt; **Program Description:** Samuel Beckett&#39;s classic play is now being presented by the Harsh Lot Theatre Company. Vladimir and Estragon wait for a mysterious figure named Godot and provide insight into many problems facing society today.
&gt; **Observations:** Researchers agreed SCP-1763-A-13&#39;s performance as Estragon was &#34;charming&#34;. While mentions of Godot remained unchanged, &#34;God&#34; was replaced with &#34;Dog&#34; throughout the production. The reason for this remains unknown.

&gt; **Performance Incident #:** 14
&gt; **Performance:** //&#34;Play With the Jenklsedn&#34;// by &#34;Rodney Harper&#34;
&gt; **Program Description:** A play all children should attend, //Play With the Jenklsedn// addresses problems of growing up, family issues, and even how to deal with a family pet.
&gt; **Observations:** Scenes include &#34;Bad Words&#34;, &#34;Why We Share&#34;, and &#34;Sexual Problems with Cats&#34;.

&gt; **Performance Incident #:** 21
&gt; **Performance:** //&#34;Love and a Sea Blorb&#34;// by &#34;J&#34;
&gt; **Program Description:** A new comedy by J, //Love and a Sea Blorb// is sure to keep your appendix rumbling as we watch a man slowly fall into madness when a sea blorb breaks up with his mother!
&gt; **Observations:** The production was overall quite humorous, albeit somewhat disturbing.

&gt; **Performance Incident #:** 22
&gt; **Performance:** //&#34;Yuk Yuks for Schmuck Schmucks&#34;//
&gt; **Program Description:** For one night only, see some of Transervita&#39;s greatest comedians come all the way to New York for some great stand-up!
&gt; **Observations:** SCP-1763-A-34 emitted a high-pitched, constant shriek for 10 minutes which caused uncontrollable laughter among researchers. Recommendation to avoid productions by any similar entities.

&gt; **Performance Incident#:** 31
&gt; **Performance:** //Hamlet// by William Shakespeare
&gt; **Program Description:** One of Shakespeare&#39;s most famous works, the Harsh Lot Theatre Company performs their interpretation of this historic piece.
&gt; **Observations:** Entire work was performed backwards, including the words themselves. In spite of this, the production was described by researchers as &#34;oddly compelling&#34;.

&gt; **Performance Incident#:** 36
&gt; **Performance:** //&#34;Hat&#34;// by &#34;Elaine Eniale&#34;
&gt; **Program Description:** On top on bottom on top on bottom on top on bottom you are nothing
&gt; **Observations:** An experimental, 6-hour piece consisting of SCP-1763-A-37 removing and replacing a New York Yankees baseball cap while repeating &#34;Hats are the system. We are the system. We are hats.&#34; Due to SCP-1763-A-37&#39;s properties, the hat was covered in a thick, pink slime.

&gt; **Performance incident#:** 40
&gt; **Performance:** //&#34;From Outer Space&#34;//
&gt; **Program Description:** Some of Harsh Lot&#39;s best improvisers put on a two-hour show about an astronaut on Mars. What happens next? We&#39;ll just have to wait and find out.
&gt; **Observations:** Mars was repeatedly referred to as being blue.
