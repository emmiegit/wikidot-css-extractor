[[span style=&#34;font-family: &#39;Reenie Beanie&#39; ;font-size: 22px;&#34;]]Getting a beeper alert at 1 in the morning was definitely a bit inconvenient, but considering that it said a whole MCD facility went up in flames I&#39;m glad that I actually woke up for it.
@@ @@
Now that I&#39;ve actually seen it, whoo-wee was it a wreck. Apparently it was their cloning facility, which makes me think it might be on purpose, not an accident. I have a few ideas for who could have done it:
@@ @@
1. Former employee, wanted revenge
--2. Customer who got swindled-- [[size smaller]]probably unlikely, wouldn&#39;t be able to get inside without getting noticed[[/size]]
3. Activist that infiltrated the facility
@@ @@
If I can find whoever did it, they could definitely be a good ally for the future. Anyone who wants to take down MCD and actually figured out how to hit them is someone worth being friends with.
@@ @@
Figured that whoever this activist is, (maybe activists, could be a team) they probably would go after some customers. Liberation in the name of the revolution and such. Shame that I couldn&#39;t get my hands on any sales records, that would make my guesswork a lot easier.
@@ @@
Just checked the Moore Estate, considering they were a repeat customer. No signs of anyone breaking in, left a bug to keep watch on the place just in case. If it&#39;s hit while I&#39;m gone, I&#39;ll know.

Driving up to the Thoroughwood Estate, to my luck I happened to arrive right in the middle of a failed car chase. A car stuffed full of clones had hit a tree just off the property, and there were several guards running after it.
@@ @@
Two not-clones were in the back, both completely knocked out. One looked a bit more rough than the other. Had a pretty cool mustache, too. Made him look a bit like Mark Twain (Twaine?) especially with that haircut. [[size smaller]]God I wish I could grow a mustache[[/size]]
@@ @@
Fired back on the guards and tried to unload all of the passengers. I figured that one of the two people in the back seat was the arsonist, so leaving the clones behind would probably not earn me any brownie points. It was a tight squeeze, but we all fit, even that Siamese one.
@@ @@
Clones insisted on dropping the guy without the mustache off at a hospital. When I asked about the other guy, they said not to worry about him. Thinking that Mr. Mustache is my guy.

Clones aren&#39;t really ones for quality conversation, but I at least got a few words out of them. Turns out Mustache is named Gene, and he was trying to bust them out. Disappointed that his name wasn&#39;t something cooler, but at least that gave me a pretty solid conviction that he was the activist.

The other guy was Mr. Thoroughwood himself, who was shot by a 226-BPD, whatever that is. Something that seems to put people in comas, I guess? (might be good to get one myself)
@@ @@
Looked through Mustache&#39;s briefcase in the mean time. Clones didn&#39;t stop me so I figured it was okay. Blueprints, memos, sales records, just about everything that a person would need to have in order to find clones. If this guy isn&#39;t my guy, then I don&#39;t know what to think.

Twitchy guy, but he&#39;s at least got enough smarts to commit arson against MCD and not get caught by them afterwards. He smells awful, though. Had to get him a breath mint before he clouded up my flat with vomit breath.

Mustache told me about what his plans are next. He&#39;s apparently trying to find a place to put the clones so they can be safe.

Not a condusive (conducive?) way to get away with arson if you say that you did it. Confronted him about it and he said that he wanted to make a statement. At the very least he&#39;s in the mindset of an activist, even if his actions don&#39;t always reflect it.

He&#39;s got potential, but I&#39;m not sure what to do about him.

Gene gave me a bit more perspective on his motives. Turns out those clones weren&#39;t just used for keeping old people alive, they were basically sex slaves for rich people. MCD knew that too, and they kept making those clones anyway.
