**Item #:** SCP-1799

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1799 is to be contained in a soundproofed humanoid containment cell, with the other Misters in Hall ██ of Site-██. Personnel entering SCP-1799&#39;s cell are to be fitted with a voice canceling helmet to prevent communication with the subject. Any personnel entering or leaving SCP-1799&#39;s cell are to be thoroughly searched for any potential weapon, and SCP-1799&#39;s cell is to be thoroughly inspected once every 24 hours to check for contraband.

**Description:** SCP-1799 is a male humanoid, approximately 1.2m tall, weighing 58kg. SCP-1799 has the physical characteristics of a generic clown. The subject&#39;s hair does not grow, with skin devoid of pigmentation and a circular red nose, along with elongated feet. Facial pigmentation has the appearance of makeup commonly worn by circus performers.  

Anything that SCP-1799 verbally communicates to humans will be interpreted by the individual(s) as a joke. The longer the subject continues speaking, the funnier the &#34;jokes&#34; will become, until the subject(s) are overcome by laughter. Due to this effect, it is extremely difficult to direct and interact with SCP-1799. The only known way to communicate with the subject is through written word, as this does not activate the effect. 

In addition, SCP-1799 is able to perform several anomalous actions. SCP-1799 has no control over these abilities, and they appear to be involuntary, painful, and random. They are usually similar to actions that would be performed by circus performers who were using props, including:

* Removal and reattachment of limbs.

* Squirting water out of a flower attached to its chest cavity.

* Pulling a string of colored cloth out of its mouth, with the longest string measuring 45.2m.

* Extruding colored smoke from several orifices.

The words &#34;Mr. Laugh, from Little Misters ® by Dr. Wondertainment&#34; are tattooed upon SCP-1799&#39;s lower back. This designation appears as &#34;3&#34; in //Document [[[SCP-909]]]-a//.

**ADDENDUM 1799-A:**

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Interview Log 1799-0&#34; hide=&#34;- Close log&#34;]]
&gt; //This interview was conducted during SCP-1799&#39;s initial containment processing.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-1799
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. B███
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** This interview was done to confirm SCP-1799&#39;s anomalous properties.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. B███:** Please state your name.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Sure. They called me... Mr. Laugh.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. B███:** [Begins laughing] Seriously? That&#39;s hilarious.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Not really.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. B███:** [Continues to laugh] Man, you are a //riot//!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Please, just... stop laughing at me. It...
&gt; 
&gt; (Dr. B███ begins to laugh hysterically, pounding a fist on the table)
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** It hurts...
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** Dr. B███ requested to be transferred away from the SCP-1799 project.

**ADDENDUM 1799-B:** During an experiment on ██/██/20██, SCP-1799 began yelling at D-9023. The subject began laughing incessantly, and, in this distracted state, tripped and suffered a severe cranial injury, which proved to be fatal. SCP-1799 became noticeably withdrawn and sullen following the event, leading to SCP-1799&#39;s first suicide attempt. As of ██/██/20██, SCP-1799 has been put on suicide watch.

**ADDENDUM 1799-C:** This note was found on SCP-1799&#39;s person during initial containment.

&gt; **Wow!** You&#39;ve just found yourself your very own Little Mister, a limited edition collection from Dr. Wondertainment!
&gt; 
&gt; Find them all and become Mr. Collector!!
