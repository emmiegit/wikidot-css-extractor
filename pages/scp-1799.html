**Item #:** SCP-1799

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1799 is to be contained in a soundproofed humanoid containment cell, with the other Misters in Hall 34-B of Site-55. Personnel entering SCP-1799&#39;s cell are to be fitted with a voice-canceling helmet to prevent communication with the subject. 

**Description:** SCP-1799 is a male humanoid, approximately 1.2 m tall, weighing 58kg. It possesses physical characteristics of a generic clown, with skin devoid of pigmentation and a circular red nose, along with elongated feet. Its facial pigmentation has the appearance of makeup commonly worn by circus performers.  

Attempts made by SCP-1799 to communicate verbally with humans will be interpreted by the individual(s) as a joke. The longer the subject continues speaking, the funnier the &#34;jokes&#34; will become, until the subject(s) are overcome by laughter. Due to this effect, it is extremely difficult to direct and interact with SCP-1799. The most effective means to communicate with the subject is through written word, as this does not activate its effect.

The words &#34;Mr. Laugh, from Little Misters ® by Dr. Wondertainment&#34; are tattooed upon SCP-1799&#39;s lower back. 

**ADDENDUM 1799-A:** This note was found on SCP-1799&#39;s person during initial containment.

&gt; **Wow!** You&#39;ve just found yourself your very own Little Mister, a limited edition collection from Dr. Wondertainment!
&gt;
&gt; Find them all and become Mr. Collector!!

**ADDENDUM 1799-B:** The following is an interview log recorded on SCP-1799&#39;s arrival at Site-55.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Interview Log 1799-0&#34; hide=&#34;- Close log&#34;]]
&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-1799
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Everwood
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** This interview was executed to confirm SCP-1799&#39;s anomalous properties.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Everwood:** Please state your name.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Sure. They called me... Mr. Laugh.
&gt; 
&gt; **Everwood:** //[Begins laughing]// Seriously? That&#39;s hilarious.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Not really.
&gt; 
&gt; **Everwood:** //[Continues to laugh]// Man, you are a //riot//!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Please, just... stop laughing at me...
&gt; 
&gt; //[Everwood begins to laugh hysterically, pounding a fist on the table]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-1799 frowns.]//

**ADDENDUM 1799-C:** The following is an interview log recorded a few days following SCP-1799&#39;s arrival at Site-55.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Interview Log 1799-2&#34; hide=&#34;- Close log&#34;]]
&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-1799
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Gears
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Dr. Everwood specially requested Dr. Gears assistance in interviewing SCP-1799 during his visit to Site-55. Dr. Gears was selected for his high memetic resistance values and low emotional response variability. 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** Hello. My name is Doctor Gears.
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-1799 remains silent.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** I was told you had difficulties in communicating due to your properties. Is this true?
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-1799 is silent.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** I was also told that you dislike being laughed at. I do not intend to laugh at you.
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-1799 is silent.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** I will not laugh at you, and if I do, I will exit the room swiftly, ending this interrogation with hopefully minimal discomfort caused to you.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Fine. But I know you&#39;re going to laugh at me so I might as well get this over with.
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** I don&#39;t intend on laughing. Not, at least, unless something humorous is said -- which I don&#39;t believe has yet occurred.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Y-you&#39;re not laughing? You&#39;re the first person I&#39;ve spoken to who doesn&#39;t just laugh at me... I don&#39;t know what to say...
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** We could start with your name.
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-1799 leans over the table and waves its hand in front of Dr. Gears&#39; face, then sticks its tongue out at him.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** Have I triggered some sort of response from you? If not, I would appreciate it if you refrained from such gestures.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Sorry, I&#39;m just used to everyone rolling on the floor laughing by now. I&#39;ve never, uh, gotten this far with anyone before.
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-1799 sits on its chair again.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** I see. Now, your name, please?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Of course! They call me Mr. Laugh. It&#39;s such a pleasure to meet you, Dr. Gears!
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** Charmed. Now, I was tasked with asking you a series of questions about yourself and Dr. Wondertainment. Is this acceptable?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Yes! And can I ask you some questions about yourself too? I think it&#39;s really interesting that you&#39;re not laughing at me. I&#39;d like to learn about that if I could.
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** This is acceptable. I&#39;ll ask the first question, if that&#39;s okay with you.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** By all means. Haha, it feels so good to have a normal conversation!
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** Are you aware of any reason Dr. Wondertainment would have had for creating you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** I know he was really into clowns for a while. Maybe he spent some time at the circus? I don&#39;t know, I could never really tell what dad was thinking.
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** I see. You may ask your question now. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Why do you think you aren&#39;t laughing? Like I said before, you&#39;re the first person who doesn&#39;t guffaw at me. Not that I&#39;m not thankful! I mean, I&#39;m loving this. I love that you&#39;re not laughing at me, it makes me feel almost normal...
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** I&#39;ve never been one for showing emotion. Not even as a child. My mother said I rarely ever cried, too. Not to say that I don&#39;t feel emotion. I just do not express myself well, I suppose.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Huh.
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** Now as for my next query; are you able to recall the process Dr. Wondertainment used to create you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Not at all. I just remember waking up one day and that was it. When was the last time you laughed?
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** It was many years ago when my daughter illustrated me. It was a humorous portrait, you see, for I was colored wildly incorrectly.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Aww, you have a kid? How sweet.
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** Indeed. Do you know anything about the location of the other Little Misters?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Umm... Mr. Fish is probably somewhere wet... but that&#39;s about all I&#39;ve got for you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** Unfortunately these answers are not of much use to myself and my employers.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** I&#39;m sorry... do I still get to ask you a question?
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** We agreed upon this. You may.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Alright. Do you think you would laugh if I said something funny?
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** I thought you didn&#39;t want to be laughed at.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** This is a hypothetical! Let&#39;s say I said something absolutely hilarious right now. Would you then laugh?
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** Perhaps. Perhaps not. It is difficult to say with certainty. I am inclined to answer no.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** I see...
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** Do you possess any knowledge on other Wondertainment products?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** No... All I know is about myself. And apparently, that&#39;s not enough for you guys.
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** I do not mean to imply that you are useless, if that is what you are suggesting. I am merely stating that these answers aren&#39;t of use to my employer. It is not a personal insult against you.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Sure, sure. Do you think your daughter would be able to make you laugh again today?
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** I&#39;d rather not discuss my daughter further. I find no joy in the topic.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Oh come on.
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** Let it suffice to say that she and I lost contact many years ago. The more time I spent at my job, the less I could spend with her. It is a tragic thing, but again, it happened many years ago.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** That&#39;s sad. Did it make you cry?
&gt; 
&gt; //[There is a pause.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** No.
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Wow. You must be some super tough guy.
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** I would not call myself that. I am just a man doing his job.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Would you say you love this job? More than your daughter?
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** It is only my job. I just happen to excel at it. But we are losing focus. We must return to my questions.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Oh, s-sorry. Yes, please continue.
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** Do you possess any knowledge of the current whereabouts of Dr. Wondertainment?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** No... but I think good ol&#39; dad likes to move around a lot. You know. To make sure he isn&#39;t caught. I presume by you guys.
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** I see. Now your question?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Do you think you would be happy to see your daughter? If you were to find each other again, that is.
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** I would rather not discuss my daughter further. I find no joy in the matter.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** I knew it, you do care about her!
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** I never said I did not. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** So you would jump at the chance to talk to her again? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** Are you familiar with the trolley problem, Mr. Laugh?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Is that the one with the people tied to the tracks?
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** Correct. I was presented with my own trolley problem when I was offered my current job. As you can see, I made my own choice. Whether or not I regret it is irrelevant. What matters is that I made my choice, and I must now endure the consequences.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** So... does that mean you wouldn&#39;t talk to your daughter if you had the chance? I&#39;m confused.
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** The most difficult part of being a parent is knowing when you&#39;re no longer needed.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Did your daughter no longer need you when you left?
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** Yes. She did require my presence. But she no longer does. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Do you think parents shouldn&#39;t keep in contact with their children then?
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** That is not what I said.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** I&#39;m just saying, I know I would like it if my dad reached out to me. Being alone is scary, and I wasn&#39;t ready for any of it. But you still have the chance! What would it hurt to reach out? Better late than never, am I right?
&gt; 
&gt; //[There is a pause.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** It is far too late for me to do that. Things have been set in motion that I cannot change. I must accept the facts and move on. At any rate, I am afraid I no longer have any questions to ask you.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Wait, does that mean you have to go now? But we were just getting to know one another!
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** Yes. Our time together has come to an end.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** Please don&#39;t go. Please. I don&#39;t want to go back to being laughed at. I want to talk some more!
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** I am sorry. I must go now.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** No! Come on, I&#39;m sure you have more questions to ask me! Please! Anything!
&gt; 
&gt; //[Dr. Gears rises and collects his notepad, moving towards the door.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** No!
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-1799 stands and moves to block the door to the interrogation chamber.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** I&#39;m begging you, sir, please stay just a little bit longer! We could talk about anything you want! I may not know much but I&#39;m quick on the uptake and I promise I can be a good conversational partner!
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** Please move, Mr. Laugh. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** No! I need this! I deserve this! Do you have any idea what it&#39;s like to be laughed at by everyone for something you can&#39;t even help? All I&#39;m asking for is five minutes of your time, surely you could spare that!
&gt; 
&gt; **Gears:** I will not hesitate to call the guards stationed outside this room if you do not acquiesce. Please move now.
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-1799 moves out of the way and sits down in its chair again.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1799:** F-Fine! Go then! I bet you&#39;re going to go laugh at me with that mean Everwood bitch now, aren&#39;t you? Whatever! I don&#39;t care!
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;END LOG&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; //Note: I&#39;ll be honest, I didn&#39;t think this would work the way it did. I just wanted to see the old man laugh for once, but he was actually able to talk to SCP-1799. Shame it wasn&#39;t able to provide any useful information. -- Dr. Everwood//
