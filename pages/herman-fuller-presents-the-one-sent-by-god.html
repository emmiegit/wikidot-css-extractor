[[include component:hf-book-right chapter=The One Sent by God|content= Poor girl, she had been with us for a long time in the circus, and she didn&#39;t deserve anything that happened to her. To tell you the truth, I never imagined that this little girl, who came almost from nowhere, would experience so many things with us. On the other hand, I must admit that it will be difficult for me to forget that night when she arrived. The moonlight was amazing that night, the sky was clear and full of stars, when we saw a figure enter the camp. A tall, blonde woman arrived at our tents and headed straight over to talk to Fuller. The woman dropped off a baby that night, and after chatting with Fuller a bit she disappeared. Clearly he was going to keep the little girl at the circus as a future investment. Even if it wasn&#39;t something useful at the moment, it would be helpful to the business in a few years. Besides, Fuller didn&#39;t feel like taking care of the little girl himself, so it seemed appropriate to leave the girl in the care of the manticore tamer. He was one of the most suitable persons in the circus to take care of her and he was always very kind to the child, taking care of her and even protecting her when she was sick. Also, for her, he was her father and the only family in the circus that she have, even the only family that she have in all the world. Still, the little girl always wandered around and made everyone&#39;s day, since we were like her little group of friends. However, Fuller didn&#39;t like the fact that the little girl was just playing all day, so he told the trainer that he had to put her to work on something. Because of this, the trainer got to work and began to enter the scene with the girl. After that, the tamer got down to work and let the little girl into his act. She enjoyed seeing the monsters frolicking around, being more peaceful, less scary, and most of all, making them happy. Although, the tamer left her more as a lovely accompaniment to the act. Imagine, &#34;the little Angel Girl taming a baby manticore&#34;, it was something quite attractive as a starter, and then the big beast enters with the tamer to do his act. Thus the little girl began to work in the tamer&#39;s presentations, being a delight to everyone in the audience and helping her &#34;father&#34; a lot in each act.

That was the beginning of the little girl&#39;s circus career, and it lasted for years and years. Always supporting the tamer in every show and being the co-star during them. She spent time with the baby stingray, it was like a pet to her, and they were always together. She even gave him a name, Milanesa. She gave it to her because she heard it around some town we visited and we all thought it was very sweet that she had given it that name, since she didn&#39;t even know it was a food. Every day the girl got better and better at her act, to the point where customers came more for her than for the tamer himself. Fuller had no choice but to give the girl her own show. Oh, and seriously it was fantastic for all of us to see Fuller himself tell her that she was going to do her own show. Seeing her hug the tamer with all the joy in the world was spectacular. She was telling him that she was finally going to be like him, she was going to be a great tamer, but in her own show. She was going to be as good as him. That had always been her dream, and the tamer was so proud of her. He always spoke to us about how his little girl was going to have the best show in the history of the circus and that was finally coming true.

[[include component:hf-left chapterL= The One Sent by God|contentL= Both started with the practices of the new big show, the girl was still a bit clumsy when she was moving around the stage, I guess that was a little bit the nerves caused by the fact that she was going to be alone on stage. But that wasn&#39;t an impediment to keep practicing and planning everything, even while she was fluttering around the place with joy she told all of us what she was going to do with her act and all the excitement she had waiting for the day she was going to be on stage. Her act was somewhat &#34;peculiar&#34; to say the least, but quite appealing to anyone in the audience. It consisted of her entering through the front door, after that she would take a bow to the entire audience, while Herman introduced her on the loudspeaker. The next thing the audience could see was our dear girl rising from the floor and passing around all the people nearby. Then she would choose the person in the audience who was in the most pain (strangely that was her gift that fascinated me the most, being able to see all the pain of the people). When she selected someone, she would go for them and lift them up next to her, while flying with extraordinary intensity. The girl would fly to the top of the entire tent and pause for a few seconds, just before swooping down and dropping the person in the audience onto the stage. Just at that moment the really impressive part would begin. We would let a large manticore onto the stage and she would carry the person in the audience right in front of the big monster. The person would be very nervous, but suddenly it would start to scare everyone, but, the beauty would stop the beast using her wings, she would surround it with her wings and make it look like a simple puppy, with this the people would go crazy with emotion, and she would be so excited about that.

The training continued, but the girl did not seem to be getting any better. She was a bit frustrated as the day was getting closer and closer, but she still kept a cheerful spirit. Mostly because Milanesa and the Tamer always accompanied her, and she was always calm with them. The problems started almost 2 weeks before the presentation. The girl really wasn&#39;t making it and Fuller had noticed that, what bothered him the most was to see that the girl still kept walking around cheerfully, even though the presentation was going badly. We all knew that when something bothered Fuller, things were going to get tense, and that was just what happened. One day we saw the really worried girl running all over camp. Milanesa was lost and nowhere to be found, until Fuller arrived. He was carrying the little stingray in his arms. The little creature was almost unrecognizable, it had no wings or tail, and it had a large cut in the center of its face. Fuller left the animal&#39;s body with the girl, who was totally broken and in tears. He told her that he hoped she would take that as an &#34;incentive&#34; to really get to work.

[[include component:hf-left chapterL= The One Sent by God|contentL= From that day on, the girl did not leave her tent and spent the whole day and night practicing. She didn&#39;t sleep, and she ate only as little as possible, she didn&#39;t want to have anyone near her while she was training. The days was eternal for him, and she couldn&#39;t be distracted by anyone, not even by the tamer. It was almost impossible to have her in front of us, but sometimes we would take turns to pass her food, and it was quite sad to go to see her. None of the times I visited her she did anything but practice. She didn&#39;t even greet us, or give us a glance, she just followed her choreography, not even noticing that we had come in. Her face showed all her tiredness, big dark circles under her eyes and shaggy hair gave her away. Every day we saw her a little worse, her legs and arms were throbbing, but she had no intention of ever stopping. The tamer was also very worried, but there was not much he could do. He prayed that this would end with a good show and that everything would go back to normal. Things stayed that way, until the day of the show arrived.

The young lady could hardly stand up from exhaustion, and her eyes looked lost, but nevertheless, the show had to go on. Everything started as planned, from the entrance to the presentation. After that it was time to fly through the air in search of a person in the audience. The poor thing barely managed to get off the ground, each flap of her wings weighed more and more, and moving was practically impossible. Even so, the girl flew and clumsily grabbed the closest person she could find. At one point she was about to fall, but with a little guidance from the tamer she was able to regain her balance. The young woman did as if that was part of the show, gave a sharp intake of breath and moved quickly towards the stage, leaving the person at her side. As soon as she landed, she could not contain herself and was hyperventilating for several seconds, holding her arms and wings, both quite sore. At that instant we opened the door for the manticore and the young woman stood in front of the person she had brought from the audience. She opened her wings and tried to wrap them around the beast, but she was so weak that a little push from the beast threw her to the side. The monster did not hold back in the least and tore every last bit of flesh from the unfortunate person. Everyone began to flee in terror, while the tamer and some helpers put the beast back in its cage. The girl, lying on her back on the stage, listened to the screams and roars of the worst night of her life. She had worked so hard only to fail and see what had been her hopes and dreams vanish in her hands.

[[include component:hf-left chapterL= The One Sent by God|contentL= While all the chaos was going on around her, she just walked to her tent, resigned to the fact that she had already lost all her future. After helping to lock up the manticore, the tamer went to see the girl, whom he had always seen as his daughter. There was crying and laughter inside the tent all night long. She cried saying that she had ruined her life, that she alone had damaged her life, while the tamer consoled her by telling her that it had only been a bad night and telling her stories of how he had started it. A little calmer and after the tamer wiped her tears, the girl could finally rest peacefully, hugging her father. The next day they both found an extremely furious Fuller, who would tell the two of them to accompany him. He led them to the same scene as last night, but now the whole place was full of thugs. Then one of the thugs tied the girl to a chair and put her in the center of the stage. The Tamer looked at Fuller in terror as Fuller handed him a knife and pulled the man closer to the girl&#39;s back. Fuller forced the Tamer to cut off the girl&#39;s wings. At that instant Fuller made the Tamer cut each feather slowly, while the poor girl kept screaming. The Tamer tried to close his eyes while he was doing such a barbarity, but Fuller did not let him, and made him watch everything he was doing to the young girl he had raised for almost 19 years. The girl had fainted from the pain when at last both wings fell. As soon as the massacre was over, Fuller became disinterested in the girl. For that very reason he ended up leaving her lying in a bar still with serious wounds. The wings were thrown in the trash as simple debris, just like what he did with her.
