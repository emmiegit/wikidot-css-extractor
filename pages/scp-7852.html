**Special Containment Procedures:** The doors accessing SCP-7852 are locked using a numeric code. Only personnel cleared by either Lead Researcher Gijs van Oosterbeek or Interim Site Director Anna Dubois are allowed entrance to SCP-7852 for containment locker retrieval.

|width=300px]]

Personnel entering SCP-7852 are to wear the specialised containment suit to cover all non-anomalous clothing and accessories. Only anomalous items are allowed on the premises of SCP-7852 outside the suit. Containment lockers are not to leave office space designated for testing, and are to be returned upon completion of test.

**Description:** SCP-7852 is the former office of Field Agent Jan Claessen, located in Site 312 in Nieuwegein. From 2002 to 2018, this office was used by Agent Claessen for assignments in the Netherlands.

SCP-7852 contains a near-complete vacuum, capable of draining all batteries and power sources of electric energy on the premises. All non-anomalous items left in SCP-7852 are ejected into the hallway. SCP-7852 is currently used as a storage unit for containment lockers 1 to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7422 10] due to its inherent dampening abilities.

**Discovery:** Over the course of 2017 and early 2018, several reports were made by Site 312 personnel about maintenance issues at the site&#39;s office space.

**Note:** Alongside these events, a change in Agent Claessen’s personality was noted by Site 312 personnel, including emotional responses and a “snappy” demeanour. Agent Claessen complained about a lack of trust in his capabilities when offered help.

The existence of SCP-7852-a was proposed by Dr. Demir to explain a correlation between these reports and Agent Claessen when building inspections couldn’t determine an underlying cause. Going forward, the effects of SCP-7852-a on Agent Claessen&#39;s wellbeing are recorded alongside the relevant SCP-7852 activity.

**Note:** Lead Researcher Gijs van Oosterbeek attempted to engage Agent Claessen in conversation concerning their mental workload several times, but was rebuffed with concerns about clearance restrictions.[[footnote]]Director Dubois later noted that at this time, there was no relevant difference in clearance levels between Van Oosterbeek and Claessen.[[/footnote]]

Despite this, Van Oosterbeek introduced several alterations in work flow that indirectly decreased workload pressure for Agent Claessen. In reports to Director Dubois, Agent Claessen noted relief and &#34;being able to better prioritise&#34; as a result.

Mx. Swanepoel spent several hours working on the technical infrastructure in SCP-7852, while engaging Agent Claessen in discussions about his family and Flemish culture. These unplanned tech updates were later reported to correlate with a decrease in activity in SCP-7852.

On 2018-05-02, a fire broke out within Agent Claessen&#39;s office. Non-anomalous fire suppression measures were ineffective in subduing the fire. After initial shock subsided, it was noted that the fire did not cross the boundaries of the office space.

During the fire, hereafter referred to as SCP-7852-1, all furniture and generic office equipment were destroyed. Foundation documentation and anomalous artefacts stored in containment locker 7[[footnote]]Although not accepted procedure, it was common practice to keep anomalous items subject to investigation in office space in between testing. This practice has been halted since.[[/footnote]] remained unaffected. Further inquiry established that the contents of containment locker 7 played no role in the SCP-7852-1 event.[[footnote]]For further details, see Internal Inquiry 312/7852.[[/footnote]]

The specific trigger for SCP-7852-1 is unknown. No SCP-7852-1 event has taken place since, and building maintenance issues have subsided. Only items related to anomalous or Foundation efforts are allowed entrance to SCP-7852 as a precaution.

To date, there is no indication as to the exact nature of SCP-7852-a’s origin, or how it latched onto Agent Claessen. An interconnection between anomalous and non-anomalous circumstances has been proposed, but due to ceased activity in SCP-7852, no further actions were taken.

After the SCP-7852-1 event, Agent Claessen used a flex office for on-site work for the remainder of his tenure.

**Update 2019-07-01:** Classification updated from ‘Safe’ to ‘Thaumiel’ as SCP-7852 has been repurposed as an on-site anomalous containment storage.

**MEETING SUBJECT:** Evaluation of Agent Jan Claessen

**ATTENDING:**
Anna Dubois, Interim Director of Site 312 and Director of Site 583
Jan Claessen, Containment Specialist and Field Agent for Site 312 and Site 583

-----
 
[BEGIN LOG]

//Agent Claessen enters Dir. Dubois’s office at Site 312. He looks tired, with a pale complexion and bags under his eyes.//

//Dir. Dubois points to the chair in front of her desk.//

**DUBOIS:** Take a seat.

//Agent Claessen sits down.//

**DUBOIS:** How are you, Jan?

**CLAESSEN:** Good, good. I’ve almost finished outlining the new Field Agent training manual for Site 583, and I’m on track for this quarter’s containment reviews. I’ve also considered your proposal for redistribution of anomalous item containment at Site 312, but haven’t worked out the details yet. All in all, I’m on schedule for this year’s goals.

**DUBOIS:** Glad to hear it. Is that why you requested this meeting?

//Agent Claessen is silent for a moment.//

**DUBOIS:** How are //you//, Jan?

**CLAESSEN:** I’m fine. Could use a vacation, I guess. But don’t we all?

**DUBOIS:** You don&#39;t need to go through me to request vacation time. But I’ve had some reports –

**CLAESSEN:** [Defensively] Is there a problem with my work?

**DUBOIS:** There isn’t a problem with the quality of your work, but I am worried about the toll it takes on you.

**CLAESSEN:** I –

//Agent Claessen looks away.//

**DUBOIS:** I’ve noticed you’re a bit tense lately. Not just with me, but also with colleagues. Including a vocal altercation with Gijs earlier this month.

//Pause.//

**DUBOIS:** I know he can be a little rough around the edges, but you don&#39;t usually let him get to you like that.

//Agent Claessen is visibly struggling to get his words out. He looks down to the floor.//

**DUBOIS:** We’re all just a little bit worried about you. //I’m// a bit worried about you. Is everything alright?

**CLAESSEN:** I – I’m fine. I am fine.

//Pause.//

**CLAESSEN:** I have it all under control.

**DUBOIS:** I never doubted that.

**CLAESSEN:** It’s just Site 312. No Keters, no big treats. We don’t even have D-Classes to monitor.

**DUBOIS:** Jan –

**CLAESSEN:** I can handle that. I can handle it!

**DUBOIS:** Jan, I know. It’s okay.

**CLAESSEN:** It shouldn’t be an issue. It’s goddamned Site 312, it’s not dangerous. It’s barely a joke. What’s the worst that can happen? A stoner getting a scare over an unscheduled coffee shop refill?

//Pause.//

**CLAESSEN:** It shouldn’t be an issue.

**DUBOIS:** But it’s just a lot right now, isn’t it?

//Agent Claessen gasps for air, and starts to sob.//

**CLAESSEN:** It feels like I can’t breathe sometimes.

//Agent Claessen sobs in silence for several seconds.//

**CLAESSEN:** I can’t fail.

//Agent Claessen starts to cry uncontrollably at this moment.//

**DUBOIS:** You&#39;re not failing.

//He grabs a tissue Dir. Dubois handed him.//

**DUBOIS:** You’ve done decades of amazing work for the Foundation. Stressful work, often while underfunded, and you’ve done amazing things. I don’t know where I would have been without you. Now does that sounds like failing to you?

**CLAESSEN:** [Quietly] I know..

//He wipes the tears from his face.//

**DUBOIS:** Wouldn’t it be nice to take some time off? A nice vacation with Jacqueline. Spend some time with the grandkids.

//Agent Claessen nods while staring at the floor.//

**DUBOIS:** Let’s do that. And in a couple of weeks, you and I are going to see what else you need.

**CLAESSEN:** [Quietly] I don’t want to give up.

**DUBOIS:** You’re not. You’ve given so much to the Foundation, it’s time we gave something back. Doesn’t that sound fair?

//Agent Claessen nods again.//

**DUBOIS:** Site 312 can survive for a while. You’ve made sure of that. Why don’t you go home early today?

**CLAESSEN:** There is stuff I need to finish! I need –

**DUBOIS:** Write them down. Make a list. I’ll make sure they get done, by me or the rest of the team.

//Dir. Dubois sits down next to him as they compose a short list of tasks. Agent Claessen visibly calms down during this interaction.//

**DUBOIS:** Are you feeling a bit better?

//She places a hand on his upper arm. Agent Claessen smiles weakly and nods.//

**CLAESSEN:** Can I – can I wait a moment in here? I don’t want them to see me like this.

**DUBOIS:** As long as you need.

Following this evaluation, Jan Claessen accepted 4 weeks of paid administrative leave, after which he started partial retirement. His current responsibilities cover auditing containment protocols of SCPs he contained during his tenure, and training new Field Agents.
