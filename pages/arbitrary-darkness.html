**//[[[SCP-003 | Biological Motherboard]]] [for thedeadlymoose]//**

Goddess, mother, anomaly
Building towards its own ideal
We fear what it could grow to be.

Organic piece of circuitry
Living chitin, not cold steel
Goddess, mother, anomaly

Benevolent, otherworldly, 
Infinite, and ethereal
We fear what it could grow to be.

We wonder of its history
There is much more we can reveal
Goddess, mother, anomaly

What could its purpose truly be?
To kill, to rule, to guard, to heal
We fear what it could grow to be.

What lies within her memory?
She thinks, she lives, but does not feel
Goddess, mother, anomaly
We fear what she could grow to be.

[[tab 917]]

**//[[[SCP-917 | Mr. Moon]]] [for Dexanote]//**

The Moon accepts with quiet grace
Enduring despite some distress
The shifting phases of his face

Like waning light, features erase
Perceptions dim, later regress
The Moon accepts with quiet grace

Eyes, ears, nose, fade without trace
He copes with fate, nevertheless
The shifting phases of his face

A simple life he does embrace
Persevering with finesse
The Moon accepts with quiet grace

Despite the losses that take place
He is not worried to possess
The shifting phases of his face

He calmly lives at his own pace
This man of lunar stateliness
This Mister Moon accepts with grace
The shifting phases of his face.

**//[[[SCP-1293 | Squeedle Deedle Dee!]]] [for PeppersGhost]//**

We are the happy as can be!
It’s apsa-tapsa-lutely true
Squeedle deedle deedle-ly dee!

We’ll dance for you so merrily
Ballet and jigs and Broadway, too
We are the happy as can be!

We seek children of heart goodly
It’s how we live and what we do
Squeedle deedle deedle-ly dee!

Our imaginations are scary
But you know how to help us through
We are the happy as can be!

We thrive because of you, you see
For your great help, our thanks are due!
Squeedle deedle deedle-ly dee!

Not all of us have arms, but we
Still wish we could hug all of you
We are the happy as can be
Squeedle deedle deedle-ly dee!

[[tab 1468]]

**//[[[SCP-1468 | Literature Birds]]]//**

Just the carving of stories is all that we need
We strain and we struggle for our own grand behest
Not a thing can compare to these words that we read

We care not for ourselves and the bounds we exceed
Yes it hurts, but we find that we have no protest
Just the carving of stories is all that we need

Through this task we press on, seldom rest, seldom feed
All our lives, all our strength we thus put to the test
Not a thing can compare to these words that we read

We have seen your efforts, crafts made by human deed
Your ink-covered paper is imperfect at best
Just the carving of stories is all that we need

To our beaks and our stomachs we pay little heed
There is only the words and the stories, our quest
Not a thing can compare to these words that we read

We do not think too much of the day we’ll succeed
What matters is the journey and how we’ve progressed
Just the carving of stories is all that we need
Not a thing can compare to these words that we read

[[tab 1522]]

**//[[[SCP-1522 | Ships That Pass In The Night]]] [for FlameShirt]//**

Despite all that’s happened, we’re truly happy
All the dangers have passed, we’re safe and alright
To live and to love in the midst of the sea

Side by side always is what we wished to be
We’re lucky enough to have loved at first sight,
Despite all that’s happened, we’re truly happy

We’ve spent many moments content as can be
To whale-watch together in fading sunlight
To live and to love in the midst of the sea

We do recall sometimes that dark memory
We think of the chasing, the harpoons in sight
Despite all that’s happened, we’re truly happy

No matter what iceberg or weapon deadly
Forever, we’d promised, regardless of plight
To live and to love in the midst of the sea

Though now we no longer can travel freely
We’re still glad we didn’t just pass in the night
Despite all that’s happened, we’re truly happy
To live and to love by the shore of the sea

**//[[[SCP-1553 | Dr. Wondertainment&#39;s Shadow Paint Play-Set!]]] [for FortuneFavorsBold]//**

Create, erase, enjoy the sight
Coax forms to dance in blackest paint
Bring darkness to the life of light

Whether drawing beast, maid, or knight
We’re sure that you’ll have no complaint
Create, erase, enjoy the sight

With Ani-Magi-Nation might
Draw power into forms once faint 
Bring darkness to the life of light

Please make sure that the lighting’s right
Remember to use with restraint!
Create, erase, enjoy the sight

There’s no more need to fear the night
Such terrors are now simply quaint
Bring darkness to the life of light

So dream on, we’re sure you’ll delight
In shadowplay without constraint
Create, erase, enjoy the sight
Bring darkness to the life of light.

**//[[[SCP-1640 | Lunar Leporine]]] [for Accelerando]//**

&gt; You must feel so lonely.
&gt; I bring gifts, outstanding
&gt; I see home below me.

&gt; When will you think of me?
&gt; How soon is the landing?
&gt; Mother, are you lonely?

&gt; Just deliver, really?
&gt; What are you commanding?
&gt; I see home below me.

&gt; Surely this all must be
&gt; A misunderstanding
&gt; Why don’t you feel lonely?

&gt; Mother, please think of me
&gt; You are too demanding
&gt; I see home below me.

&gt; I’ve grown strong, you will see
&gt; Mother, I am landing.
&gt; I can’t stay so lonely
&gt; Home is where I will be.

**//[[[SCP-1832 | Faith Half-Healer]]] [for Gaffney]//**

I was never really a fraud
I simply act the way I must
I know how it feels, to be God.

The Lord’s strength fills me, full and broad
My healings were all built on trust
I was never really a fraud

I lead the masses trite and awed
Mete punishment for sin and lust
I know how it feels, to be God.

I see through lies, condemn the flawed
Work miracles as I see just
I never really was a fraud

I’ve gone past where preachers have trod
Condemn the fragile to the dust
I know how it feels, to be God.

Although my actions earn no laud
I can’t just let my talents rust
I never really was a fraud
I know how it feels, to be God.

[[div style=&#34;float:left; width: 45%; padding: 0 2%&#34;]]
It’s clear which soda you’ll love more
Lime Liftoff lifts you to the sky
To friendly rivals, THIS MEANS WAR

We know what privileged folk look for
Know what the high class wants to buy
It’s clear which soda you’ll love more

Above uncultured slobs you’ll soar
Elite taste is the way to fly
To friendly rivals, THIS MEANS WAR

Your life depends on it, we’re sure
A shame should your flight go awry
It’s clear which soda you’ll love more

Sarsaparilla will make you snore
Cream’s really so mundane you’d die
To friendly rivals, THIS MEANS WAR

The fruit of knowledge all adore
Is the lime; we will not deny
It’s clear which soda you’ll love more
To friendly rivals, THIS MEANS WAR
[[/div]]

[[div style=&#34;float:left; width: 45%; padding: 0 2%&#34;]]
It’s clear which soda you’ll love more
Our Sarsaparilla Cream’s the best
To friendly rivals, THIS MEANS WAR

For a great price at any store
From Carl’s Caffeine Club, we attest
It’s clear which soda you’ll love more

Breathtaking taste none can ignore
Go on and put it to the test
To friendly rivals, THIS MEANS WAR

Never again breathe muck or gore
This drink was made to soothe the stressed
It’s clear which soda you’ll love more

Lime Liftoff is what we abhor
Elitists simply can’t contest
To friendly rivals, THIS MEANS WAR

Those Limey Drinkers are a bore
So //let them burn//, we do suggest
It’s clear which soda you’ll love more
To friendly rivals, THIS MEANS WAR

**//[[[SCP-2307 | The Pen Is Mightier]]] [Holiday Art Exchange gift for Ihp]//**

The blade unmade, the stories blurred
A mystic legend oft retold 
A broken stylus wrote the word.

The shaman’s wisdom undeterred 
A horsehead crown the truth will hold
The blade unmade, the stories blurred.

The king to battle each time spurred
Through love and loss, stands ever bold
A broken stylus wrote the word.

The son of treason, cries unheard
Meets each new end in blood run cold
The blade unmade, the stories blurred.

The lady of a vow conferred 
In water seals the sword controlled
A broken stylus wrote the word.

The metal god, with wrath incurred
Has watched these crisscrossed fates remold
The blade unmade, the stories blurred.
A broken stylus wrote the world.

Twirling through the ocean vast
Two of us, in endless dance
Side by side two nets are cast.

##FF6600|We will face this space contrast##
##FF6600|Trust our love, our lives to chance##
##FF6600|Side by side two nets are cast. ##

Think not of the trials we’ve passed
How we’ve burned for this romance-- 
Twirling through the ocean vast

**//[[[SCP-4149 | Professor Xorkanoff&#39;s Gallery of the Bizz-art]]] [Holiday Art Exchange gift for rounderhouse]//**

My cultural appreciation simply cannot be dismissed
My given name is Xorkanoff, and I am here to play my part
I am the very model of a modern art sloth gallerist
 
Hiding in these pocket universes, verily I won’t desist
I’ll safeguard unique masterworks and all the feelings they impart
My cultural appreciation simply cannot be dismissed
 
To all newcomers shy or lost, don’t be afraid, I can assist
(There’s nothing that can’t be explained as eclectic performance art)
I am the very model of a modern art sloth gallerist
 
Feel free to ask me to speak slower if there’s something I have missed
Or debate why Zarzagon 15’s charcoal paintings stand apart
My cultural appreciation simply cannot be dismissed
 
I’ll champion emotive artwork even if others resist
It matters not if I am viewed as some sort of extreme upstart
I am the very model of a modern art sloth gallerist
 
Rebuilding is no easy feat, the trials are toil, but still quite bliss
So long as I can climb through worlds, I will collect these works of heart
My cultural appreciation simply cannot be dismissed
I am the very model of a modern art sloth gallerist.

We’re the Mannequin Troupe: we live for our art 
Eternally ready to heed your request
Just give us a purpose, and we’ll play our part

Through dust and in darkness, we’re stage props at heart
In absence of audience, we each did our best
We’re the Mannequin Troupe: we live for our art 

When our theater was gone, we sought a fresh start
For science’s sake, we committed to test
Just give us a purpose, and we’ll play our part

Though long left behind, we have much to impart
Easily changing our design at behest 
We’re the Mannequin Troupe: we live for our art 

We’ve plenty of talents, we’re skilled and we’re smart
Together we’ll build, even dance with great zest
Just give us a purpose, and we’ll play our part

We’re a group through and through, don’t keep us apart
We’d rather be helping than locked up to rest
We’re the Mannequin Troupe: we live for our art 
Just give us a purpose, and we’ll play our part
