------
&gt; A knock on the door. “You got time for one more signature?” It’s Dr. North.
------
&gt; Laughter bursts through the door and into Dr. Cimmerian&#39;s office. A winged cherub with a bow and a smile of a thousand commercial toddlers zips about chased by PTF Kappa-143.
------
&gt; Cimmerian had been shot in the shoulder; North in the back. Both are painfully aware of what’s about to occur. The Cupid’s arrows dissolve into pink light.
------
&gt; &#34;North, let me make this clear: at this moment we are supernaturally attracted to each other. Containment Procedures for people shot by that damn cherub are to let things play out. One day of making a complete fool of yourself in front of another fool. The best case scenario is that it&#39;s only moderately embarrassing.&#34;
------
&gt; Cimmerian picks up a flower from the floor. Daisies. It&#39;ll do, Cimmerian supposes. He places the flower into Dr. North&#39;s coat and covers it up.
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Let&#39;s just hope no one else gets wind of this.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; “Agreed.”

+++ Site-88 Rooftop - 7:40 PM:

&#34;... that&#39;s bullshit. Right?&#34;

Cimmerian laughs while North attempts to figure out if [http://www.scp-wiki.net/four-stories-told-in-order| any of the stories are real].

&#34;All true stories! My turn, North.&#34; Cimmerian sips his coffee. &#34;Why do you wear 3-D glasses?&#34;

&#34;I got my reasons.&#34;

&#34;Ah, brooding of course. It&#39;s a shame though, your eyes have lovely dimensions.&#34;

&#34;God damn it, Cimmerian!&#34; North feels his face redden behind his red and blue specs. &#34;My turn! Since you won’t tell me how you really got your scars…&#34;

North thinks for a moment. &#34;Do you think we could last?&#34;

North and Cimmerian sit by the railing on the site rooftop. Minutes earlier, they’d gotten drinks. Minutes before that, they’d agreed to go on a date. And minutes before that, they were both hit by an arrow-wielding mind-altering love baby. 

&#34;Probably not.&#34; Cimmerian puts down his drink. &#34;A relationship built off an emotion affecting anomaly doesn’t exactly sound like a healthy foundation.&#34;

&#34;But would you still try it?&#34;

&#34;I’d have to get over those ridiculous glasses, but we’ll see.&#34;

North nurses his beer and contemplates this.

&#34;Hey Cimmerian, maybe we should-

##green|//&#34;KISS!&#34;//##

… Excuse me?

##green|//&#34;KISS ALREADY!&#34;//## a scratchy voice yelled.

That wasn’t Cimmerian. The daisy in North’s coat had just spoken.

&#34;Ah! Christ!&#34; North grabs the little weed off his pocket and throws it across the rooftop.

The daisy bounces harmlessly on the concrete. 

Unperturbed, the plant yells, ##green|//&#34;YOU&#39;RE MY OTP! WHEN ARE YOU GONNA KISS? I JUST WANNA WATCH!&#34;//##

North stares at the flower in disbelief. Cimmerian was already talking into his communicator.

&#34;Calling any available units. There is a sentient plant anomaly on the roof. Send a containment team im-

The communicator shatters in Cimmerian’s hands. A long green tendril reaches back to the daisy.

##green|//&#34;NO DISTRACTIONS!&#34;//## The flower stands up and brandishes several sharp leafy whips.

##green|//&#34;START OVER OR ELSE.&#34;//##

North and Cimmerian look at each other. His back turned to the daisy, North mouths some words to Cimmerian. 

Have you got a gun?

Cimmerian winks. Of course. You?

North sighs. Nope. Alright, he&#39;ll be the bait. What a time to not have a gun.

Break on three? Yeah.

One. Two. Three.

North and Cimmerian bolt to either side of the daisy.

##green|//&#34;NO!!!&#34;//## the daisy sends its vines into a deadly whirlwind.

North runs and ducks through vines. Cimmerian dashes and aims his pistol.

North jumps away from a vine, but a second vine heads his way before he can land.

The vine explodes as Cimmerian lands a shot along its length. North lands safely. The daisy yells in pain.

##green|//&#34;THAT WAS MY FAVORITE VINE! DON&#39;T MAKE ME TAKE THIS FIC FROM FLUFF TO SMUT YOU FLIRTY SLASH PAIR. I SWEAR I&#39;M GONNA MAKE YOU-//##

A rifle bullet runs right through the daisy&#39;s stem. North looks at Cimmerian. Cimmerian shakes his head. That wasn&#39;t me.

The daisy and vines fall limp on the concrete. At the rooftop entrance, MTF Sigma-23 &#34;Mulchers&#34; is on the scene. North and Cimmerian relax. The destruction of an anomaly isn&#39;t the best outcome but at least the Ethics Committee Liaison and the Assistant Director of Espionage and Logistics are-

&gt; //Ring ring. Ring ring. Click.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Author:** Yes, hello?
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;//Indistinct phone chattering.//&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Author:** Wait, what? What do you mean North&#39;s spy identity is supposed to be a secret?
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;//Phone chattering continues.//&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Author:** Fine. I&#39;m retconning, but I&#39;m not changing the first installment. 
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;//Robot voice synthesizer.//&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Author:** Yes, it&#39;s a beautiful testament to North&#39;s site presence.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;//Agreeable phone chattering.//&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Author:** Enjoy, lad. Bye!
&gt; 
&gt; //Click.//

The destruction of an anomaly isn&#39;t the best outcome but at least the Ethics Committee Liaison and //the totally mundane junior researcher he was with// are safe.

The Mulchers move to secure the perimeter. North downs the rest of his beer. Cimmerian goes to pick up his coffee but he sees the daisy&#39;s remains glow bright green. Oh no.

##green|//&#34;YOU...&#34;//##

Cimmerian shouts, &#34;Look out!&#34;

The glowing green pile erupts into a flurry of vines that pick up every single MTF member. 

##green|//&#34;YOU THOUGHT WE WERE DONE? **YOU&#39;RE DONE WHEN I SAY YOU&#39;RE DONE.&#34;**//##

The vines consider the MTF members. ##green|//**&#34;I WAS THINKING OF MULCHING THE MULCHERS BUT WE&#39;RE DUE FOR SOME DISNEY RATED VIOLENCE.&#34;**//## The vines launch every single MTF member off the roof. They all land miraculously unharmed in trees.

##green|//**&#34;NOW THAT WE&#39;RE ALONE. IT&#39;S TIME FOR A LITTLE ONE-WINGED ANGEL ACTION.&#34;**//##

North and Cimmerian hide behind the rooftop entrance port. The storm of mad vines coalesce. They twine upon each other and build up an enormous sinuous womanly mass. The vines&#39; chosen form is verdant and voluptuous. A mane of green vines erupts from what appears to be its head. Bangs of vines fall onto its face hiding all but bright yellow lips and a single yellow eye that smile greedily. At the center of its chest, a large white and yellow daisy beats steadily.

The giant green woman moans, ##green|//**&#34;AH! THAT&#39;S BETTER!&#34;**//## she calls to them, ##green|//**&#34;OH, BOYS WHERE ARE YOU?&#34;**//##

North asks, &#34;What do we do Cimm? She&#39;s freaking crazy!&#34;

Cimmerian thinks, then his eyes light up. &#34;I&#39;ve got it! The references to fanfiction, that level of disconnection from reality and logic, the constant fourth wall breaking! It can only mean she&#39;s a meta-narrative entity. Judging by her desire to see us kiss, her power must stem from //our// romantic narrative.&#34;

North frowns. &#34;... what? //Seriously!?//&#34;

Cimmerian laughs, &#34;Yes! Don&#39;t you see, we just have to-

##green|//**&#34;THERE YOU ARE!&#34;**//## A long green tendril picks up Dr. Cimmerian.

&#34;Cimmerian!&#34; shouts North as Cimmerian dangles in the air.

##green|//**&#34;YES! YELL FOR HIM! YOUR CUTESY ROMANTIC TENSION IS DELICIOUS.&#34;**//##

&#34;Put him down!&#34; yells North.

##green|//**&#34;OKAY.&#34;**//##

The green woman swings her vines and throws Cimmerian straight at North. North can&#39;t dodge or else Cimmerian breaks something. North hopes his own body is a soft enough landing cushion.

North holds out his hands.

Three. Two. One. Impact.

North and Cimmerian roll across the rooftop. North feels his foot twist not how it&#39;s supposed to. A sharp pain shoots right through it. The pair roll to a stop.

##green|//**&#34;NOW THAT&#39;S WHAT YOU CALL FALLING FOR SOMEONE.&#34;**//##

&#34;Jesus Fucking Jesus Christ! Twisted my god damn ankle!&#34; North grabs his foot in pain.

Cimmerian shakes away his daze at being thrown. He rights himself up and leans down towards North.

&#34;Alright, that&#39;s enough.&#34; Cimmerian cups North&#39;s agonized face. &#34;North, look at me. We gotta finish this or we&#39;re not gonna make it out of here.&#34;

North nods through his twisted ankle.

Cimmerian yells at the green woman, &#34;Hey! We&#39;ll give you what you want!&#34;

##green|//**&#34;FINALLY!&#34;**//## The giant green woman leans over the two of them.

##green|//**&#34;GO ON!&#34;**//##

Cimmerian brings his face close to North. North looks at Cimmerian through the searing pain in his ankle.

##green|//**&#34;KISS! KISS! KISS!&#34;**//## the green woman cheers. Her daisy heart beats faster in excitement.

Cimmerian whispers to North, &#34;We&#39;ll have to slow down on the next date. Things are moving so fast, I&#39;m getting daisy.&#34;

North groans and winces. &#34;Your puns make having a twisted ankle not so painful. But next date, eh? You over my glasses already?&#34;

&#34;Not yet, but lens not lose sight of the big picture.&#34;

&#34;Just kiss me already, Cimmerian.&#34;

Cimmerian and North kiss. The enormous green daisy woman grins in glee. Cimmerian and North feel their lips touch. It is a short sweet kiss. One reflective of their day together, their unknown crazy future together. It&#39;s just them, but together. Cimmerian and North retreat their lips. North pats Cimmerian&#39;s face. They smile. They laugh. They lock hands.

In Cimmerian&#39;s gloved hand, his pistol suddenly glows an unnatural pink. North gives Cimmerian a raised eyebrow. Cimmerian nods. Together they aim and shoot the pink gun right at the giant green woman&#39;s daisy heart.

The bullet turns into a bright pink thread. It winds around the green woman&#39;s body over and over. The binding thread glows brighter as it restrains her.

##green|//**&#34;AH, CATHARTIC LOVE MAGIC! HOW MUCH BETTER CAN THIS GET? THIS IS THE PERFECT WAY TO GO! CIMMNORTH FOREVER!&#34;**//## 

The pink light intensifies.

##green|//**&#34;SEE YOU SOON BOYS!&#34;**//##

The light flashes.

When the light settles, Cimmerian and North see the daisy woman&#39;s gigantic form is dried, brown, withered, and lifeless. They both sigh in relief.

Cimmerian sees a rifle dropped by one of the MTF members. He grabs it, rips his pant leg, and splints North&#39;s twisted ankle up.

&#34;Let&#39;s go get you some ice.&#34;

&#34;Yeah, that sounds good.&#34;

Cimmerian helps North up and together they hobble to the infirmary.

Cimmerian looks back at the results of the chaos. &#34;This will be a whole lot of clean up. I hope the Mulchers got out of those trees.&#34;

North remembers something and chuckles. &#34;Hey, Cimmerian.&#34;

&#34;What?&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s your turn.&#34;

Cimmerian laughs. &#34;Oh right! Let&#39;s see.&#34;

Cimmerian thinks. &#34;Have you... dated a guy before?&#34;

North winces but not from his ankle. &#34;At this point, hell if I know.&#34;

They both laugh.

&#34;My turn.&#34;

------

The wind blows.

The husk of the daisy woman withers in the air. A large dry pod at the center of its chest pulls into itself and shrivels up. The pod disperses several hundred odd seeds onto the rooftop.

Each seed is shaped like a little baby with wings. 

The sound of laughter echoes through the trees.</textarea></pre>
