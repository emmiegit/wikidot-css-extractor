Welcome to the hub page for the SCP Foundation Wiki&#39;s Seminars and Workshops, an interactive learning platform on various topics including critique, writing techniques, wiki culture, and more! On this page, you will find a calendar for upcoming seminars/workshops.

**With the new restructuring of seminars, updates will be held on the Wiki&#39;s social media pages. As of now, we are currently planning on which platform would be ideal for hosting seminars. We thank you for your patience.** 

**__The SCP Foundation Orientations will be held on the official [https://www.twitch.tv/scpwiki SCP Wiki Twitch Page!]__**

Workshops and seminars held by various staff members on various topics. Critique, writing, dialogue, and more! The seminars are an interactive learning platform, and include activities and discussion to help keep everyone engaged and learning.

+++ __When are they?__

Each workshop/seminar will be announced //at least// 1 month in advance of the event itself in this thread, so you will be able to keep up with the schedule.

+++ __Who leads the workshops/seminars?__

Anyone on staff may be the host of the event. The host of each seminar/workshop will be announced with the event&#39;s announcement itself.

+++ __How can I participate?__

Previously, seminars were held on #workshop of skipIRC. As of now, however, we are internally discussing the future of where seminars will be hosted. Updates will be posted, and we thank you for your patience.
