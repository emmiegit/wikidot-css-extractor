**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the nature of SCP-5829, personnel assigned to the object are to be regularly rotated. Should any egg produced by SCP-5829 contain messages relating to any of its current caretakers, that caretaker is to be removed from the project and amnesticized. No caretaker is permitted to remain assigned to SCP-5829 for a period of longer than one month. All former caretakers of SCP-5829 are to be amnesticized following the conclusion of their assignment. No personnel identifying as male are allowed near SCP-5829.

SCP-5829 is currently kept in a standard Foundation livestock pen provided with standard amenities and care required by nonanomalous //Gallus gallus domesticus//, as well as any further care recommended by GOI &#34;Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions&#34;. Please see Addendum 5829.2 below for further details.

SCP-5829 is under constant observation. Should SCP-5829 begin nesting behaviors, active researchers are to prepare to recover and transport any eggs laid to SCP-5829 Incubation Storage, placed in individual incubators, and designated with the next available number. All text seen on the eggs must be logged and forwarded to the site directors for further documentation instruction. These eggs are actively monitored at all times. Should any egg begin hatching, any further procedures relating to that egg must be followed. All hatched chicks are to be quarantined and monitored for potential anomalous traits for a period lasting no less than one month. Nonanomalous chicks may be returned to SCP-5829 for rearing and socialization. 

**Description:** SCP-5829 is a Georgian Black Hen of standard size and weight for its species, originally under the care of GoI &#34;Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions&#34;. All eggs laid by SCP-5829 contain statements that allude to various future events relating to humans that it has been exposed to for at least three minutes[[footnote]]Currently SCP-5829&#39;s range of exposure is unclear. All recorded predictions thus far have only been related to personnel who have been within SCP-5829&#39;s line of sight.[[/footnote]]. These events so far have invariably come true upon the egg hatching. Every egg laid by SCP-5829 is fertile despite SCP-5829 having never mated at any point since its containment. All chicks born from an egg laid by SCP-5829 have thus far been --nonanomalous Georgian Black Chickens.-- **See Addendum 5829.1**  An abbreviated listing of predictions made by SCP-5829&#39;s eggs is provided below. All information prior to 6/28/2016 was provided by Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions. 

------

||~ Egg Lay Date ||~ Egg Text ||~ Notes ||
||= 1/16/2013 ||= Jackson ██████ and Caroline ██████ will wed ||= Egg hatched on 3/5/2017. Foundation investigation revealed that the two individuals named on the egg held a wedding on that day and had exchanged vows the moment the egg hatched.||
||= 1/19/2013 ||= Margaret ██████ will fall down the stairs and break their leg||= Egg hatched on 1/19/2013, approximately five minutes after laying. Caretaker Margaret ██████ of Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions fell down the stairs to SCP-5829&#39;s pen while carrying feed and broke their leg when they fell on a feeding trough.||
||= 11/6/2013 ||= Big Barry Bottoms will be adopted||= Egg hatched on 3/3/2014. Big Barry Bottoms, a Crested Gecko in Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions&#39; care, had its adoption finalized upon the egg hatching. ||
||= 7/30/2016||= Dr. Faran Caraway will suffer internal distress ||= Egg hatched on 8/4/2016. Dr. Caraway, who had been assigned head of SCP-5829 research, reports severe gastric distress upon the egg hatching.[[footnote]]Later research revealed this to be due to recent consumption of foods containing lactose. Dr. Caraway is lactose intolerant.[[/footnote]]||
||= 9/25/2016 ||= **A HORRIFIC KETER WILL PLAGUE AGENT ADDISON** ||= Egg hatched on 10/29/2016. Due to the threatening nature of the egg&#39;s prediction, Foundation personnel were placed on high alert. [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5776 The object predicted by the egg was recovered and contained successfully.][[footnote]]Agent Addison had recently visited SCP-5829&#39;s containment pen prior to the egg being laid.[[/footnote]] ||
||= 6/28/2017 ||= Christ is coming ||= Egg hatched on 9/30/2017. The first recorded manifestation of [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5991 SCP-5991] in front of Foundation personnel occurs upon the egg hatching.[[footnote]]Foundation investigations revealed that the agent involved in SCP-5991 had recently visited SCP-5829&#39;s containment pen. Agent reported that he had consumed an entire Bible over the course of 4 months in response to a bet. Investigation into SCP-5829&#39;s ability to track the appearances of other anomalies is pending.[[/footnote]]||
||= 10/3/2017 ||= Agent Sias will have a nice day ||= Egg hatched on 2/14/2018 at 23:59. Foundation agent Sias reports having had an above average day.||
||= 12/24/2017||= Jackson ██████ and Caroline ██████ will divorce ||= Egg hatched on 12/25/2017. Foundation investigation revealed that both individuals named on the egg finalized divorce procedures the moment the egg hatched.||

**Addendum 5829.1:** Incident Report

[[collapsible show=&#34;+Access Addendum&#34;]]

On 8/30/2014, an egg was laid inscribed with text reading &#34;I will be a monster&#34;. Upon the request of Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions, Foundation Agents assisted with monitoring SCP-5829 and the egg in anticipation of abnormal behavior. On 1/26/2015 the egg hatched. The creature that hatched from the egg appeared to be a cross-breed between a standard Georgian Black Chick and a //Canis lupus familiaris//, specifically an American Bull Terrier. The creature was highly aggressive and displayed strength disproportional to its size, managing to destroy its incubator and escape into the WWS livestock pens. The creature then proceeded to maul three animals before it was neutralized by Foundation agents. The creature&#39;s corpse revealed no further anomalous features and is currently held in Foundation cold storage. SCP-5829 was voluntarily surrendered into Foundation care following this incident.

**Addendum 5829.2:** Investigation into PoI-5829.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+Access Addendum&#34;]]

After reviewing documentation provided by Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions, SCP-5829&#39;s former owner was designated as PoI-5829. Foundation agents performed a raid on PoI-5829&#39;s home and discovered several objects and books relating to thaumaturgy and thaumaturgical practices. These items were seized and taken into Foundation custody. The most notable item seized was a book titled //The Yorkshire Witch&#39;s Guide to Predictive Magicks//. This book was bound with a mixture of animal leathers and tanned human flesh, later identified as belonging to Mary Bateman[[footnote]]An individual that became known as the Yorkshire Witch. She was infamous for her supposed thaumaturgy and criminal activities.[[/footnote]]. The book notably contained the following passage:

&gt; **The Prophet Hen**
&gt; 
&gt; One of the most basic practices of a young witch involves performing simple fortunes. Most witches are content with the conventional means of fortunetelling, be it palm reading or gazing into a ball of crystal. I have explored more interesting and alternative methods, and have made a breakthrough that I am delighted to share with you. The following spell will allow you to turn a simple hen into a fortuneteller, allowing you to stake your claim into an uncharted field of witchcraft. 
&gt; 
&gt; Please ensure that you follow the instructions exactly and perform them in a clean area free from debris. I have found that there are unusual results when unintended detritus is mixed into the standard ingredients, including altering the hen&#39;s ability to detect who to make the predictions for, and causing hatched chicks to undergo unexpected transmogrification. I have had more than a few issues involving unexpected fortunes and unpredictable chicks! Should you follow the spell exactly as written, the hen will be able to successfully predict the fortunes of anyone you bring into the same room as it, and these fortunes will come true once the egg hatches.

&#39;Delphi&#39; is the name of our beautiful resident Georgian Black Chicken! At some point this sweet girl got out of Georgia and settled in Boring. We found her neglected in someone&#39;s back yard with a ramshackle coop and poor quality feed. We rescued her assuming she was just a standard chicken, but boy were we wrong!

Delphi caught our attention as something special when she laid her first egg. It had writing on it! This was certainly a neat surprise, but what really surprised us was the fact that the egg seemed to claim that some of our resident caretakers were going to get married. Delphi surprised us further when her egg hatched and her little prediction came true! Sure enough, every egg Delphi lays has a prediction on it that comes true when it hatches. Our little oracle has certainly earned her name!

**History!**
[[/&gt;]]
[[/div]]
[[div style=&#34;color:#665731; background: #d1ed9a;padding: 15px;&#34;]]

We originally received a report from a suburb in Boring that their neighbor had been gone for several weeks, leaving their pet chicken completely unattended. When we arrived we found exactly that- poor Delphi left all alone with little food, little shelter, and covered in her own waste. There were several hatched eggs present on the property, but we were not able to find any of Delphi&#39;s chicks. Whoever it was that left the poor girl in that condition was nowhere to be found. We also recovered a dog from that property who has since gone on to find a home of her own!

We got Delphi out of there as quickly as we could, and after a nice bath and snack of some seeds, we got her set up in her current home at Coop 11. Delphi seemed awfully down when we first brought her in, and had some issues when we assigned male caretakers to her. We were surprised, however, at how fast she took to Rosemary! Whenever Delphi sees Rosemary she comes running and drops into a play bow. You should see it when she wiggles her little tush in the air! If Delphi decides that she likes you, she&#39;ll more than likely run up along her fence and cluck at you. Some caretakers say it almost sounds like she&#39;s trying to bark!

Delphi surprisingly has a taste for dog food. We aren&#39;t entirely sure why that is, maybe something to due with being homed with a dog before? All we know for certain is that the girl goes wild for the stuff, so feel free to give her some kibbles as a treat from time to time!

[[/div]]
[[div style=&#34;color:#665731; background: #c8e293;padding: 15px;&#34;]]
[[&gt;]]
**Special Needs and Accommodations!**
[[/&gt;]]
[[/div]]
[[div style=&#34;color:#665731; background: #d1ed9a;padding: 15px;&#34;]]

Delphi isn&#39;t a very picky chicken. She&#39;s content with a standard coop, some space to wander, and plenty of sunshine. We&#39;ve found that she really perks up if she&#39;s given some toys to play with, so we&#39;ve made sure that her enclosure has plenty of small rubber toys! Beyond that, just make sure she&#39;s fed twice a day and that she gets a little bit of playtime with a caretaker each day.

We have noticed that Delphi appears to have some slight trust issues. Any male caretakers should only be introduced to her with Rosemary present, since Delphi has been known to get snappy and rude otherwise. If you are a male caretaker, make sure you spend your first few visits with her alongside Rosemary before tending to Delphi on your own! 

Since Delphi&#39;s eggs predict the future, we&#39;ve set up a few cameras in her enclosure that help us keep an eye on her. She&#39;s prone to nesting and laying at fairly random times, so everyone taking care of her needs to be ready at any time. If she lays, make sure you carefully remove the egg from her enclosure and take it to one of our incubators. Don&#39;t worry about Delphi, she hasn&#39;t seemed to mind us taking the eggs from her! Once you get the egg to the incubator, take note of when it was laid and what the egg says.

If you&#39;re in charge of monitoring the eggs, your main job is to check if any hatch. If they do, congratulations! You have a sweet baby chick on your hands! In all seriousness, though, make sure you take note of what the egg said before it hatched, let one of the higher ups know it hatched, and follow any special procedures that were assigned to that egg. There aren&#39;t normally any crazy procedures to follow, normally just making sure that anyone predicted to get hurt gets care they need or that we have a good party planned for any adoptions! From there, go ahead and move the chick to our special chick rearing center. Don&#39;t stress too much, we haven&#39;t had any world-ending predictions yet!

**INCIDENT:** //On 8/30/2014, Delphi laid an egg with the message &#34;I will be a monster&#34;. Due to the concerning nature of this prediction, the Supervisors were contacted and asked to help with monitoring Delphi and the egg until it hatched.//

**INCIDENT:** //On 1/26/2015, Delphi&#39;s &#34;I will be a monster&#34; egg hatched. The baby that hatched proceeded to break out of the incubator and tear through our livestock pens. Unfortunately, we lost Terry, Basketball, and Susanna during the incident, and the baby itself passed away after Supervisor intervention. Because of this incident, we have made the decision to hand Delphi over to the Supervisors. We hope that she makes plenty of new friends in her new home.//

//Our hearts go out to Terry, Basketball, Susanna, and Delphi&#39;s caretakers. One of the worst things that happens here at Wilson&#39;s is losing one of our critters.//
