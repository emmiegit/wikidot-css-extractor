1. This document is being forwarded specifically to higher-level officers only due to certain political consequences for myself should the full content of this be revealed publicly. I trust all of you will behave with the utmost discretion when discussing the contents of this memorandum with your subordinates.

2. The recent protests around Iran, which has served as the principal headquarters of this Organization in the half-century since its inception, have grown too significant to ignore. While we have made every effort in the past to abide by the intent of the Organization&#39;s founders to avoid official government association, I and the other members of the Central Committee have agreed that enforcing this separation is no longer in the best interest of the organization.

3. My sympathies with Ruhollah Ayatollah Khomeini and his movement are well documented. While I know many in the Organization disagree with his fundamentalism, I doubt there are many who, in their heart of hearts, feel that Iran is better served by the despotic rule of a Western puppet-king. I have been in contact with Khomeini, who is aware of and tentatively interested in our organization, disturbed by its less than orthodox adherence to the strictest tenets of Sh&#39;ia Islam though he may be.

4. Two practical realities dominate this situation. First, we are not going to be rid of the Ayatollah or his movement. The Central Committee has projected a likely complete overthrow of the Shah&#39;s government and installation of some form of government under Khomeini by no later than this time next year. An insistence on opposition to this movement (which would not serve us) or autonomy (which would draw the ire of all sides) could lead to our destruction by those forces that do not understand the true role we play in protecting our homelands from foreign threats. Second, the Ayatollah is not likely to be rid of us. In my meeting with Khomeini, I revealed an aspecific portion of the plans for Operation Golden Horde, with a slight reminder that in a war of hearts and minds, hundred-meter-tall golems walking the streets of Tehran are not likely to be viewed as a positive harbinger for the new government.

5. By agreement with the Khomenites, ORIA will formally become a wing of the new government as soon as it is installed in power; the Ayatollah feels that a degree of oversight would help us &#34;come to understand&#34; proper Orthodoxy in time. We will directly begin providing assistance to the protesters as we are able to, up to and including the special artifacts that we control; this will provide an excellent opportunity for field application and demonstration of the military capacities of our stored artifacts. In exchange for this assistance and our eventual sublimation into government oversight, I have been assured that our effective autonomy will not be tampered with by the new government. Our operations will continue unabated, our continued inclusion of non-Iranian personnel from across the Muslim world, including Sunnis, Kurds, pagans, and Jews will not be opposed by the government, and we will soon be receiving direct funding from the national government of Iran, which should help us advance our cause.

6. House Afseneh has directly insisted that they be left out of this arrangement. What little interest they have in human politics does not extend to revolution, and they have expressed extensive concerns about Khomeini. They have agreed that our traditional alliance shall be continued, with ORIA as the principal intermediary between our peoples, but any disclosure of the existence of the Afsenites or any other //djinn// House may lead to a permanent termination of relations. I need not stress how damaging this would be to our cause.

7. I will be resigning my position as head of the Organization effective immediately. The Ayatollah has requested, given my popularity and generally respected position among both fundamentalist Muslims in the country and some of the less-enthusiastic moderates, that I take a more active role in his developing government. Mohammad Khatami shall replace me as the head of this organization as Director; rather than being known as Chairman, his title shall reflect the official name this organization will have within the new government, the Islamic Artifact Reclamation Directorate.

8. Protect our people. Protect our nations. In all times, this mandate will always stand.

9. This memorandum transmitted 23 Sharivar 1358 (14 September 1978).

[[/TABLE]]

1. Paragraphs here are numbered. You should make a specific point with each paragraph. If you need more than one paragraph to make each point, try to either condense the point (keep in mind that the person reading this should already have read several prior-written documents and reports about the phenomenon under discussion, so they may already know somethings that you can leave out for implication purposes, similar to redaction) or split the subject into two distinct points.

2. The document listed here is two pages long for example purposes. You&#39;re within your rights to vary how long each paragraph is and how many paragraphs are on each page, but try to keep the dimensions of the resulting finished product approximately page-sized (8.5x11in in American terms). (This document is shorter because these are bogus points being made here.) I don&#39;t think people are likely going to take a ruler to their computer monitor to check your work, but making a page that&#39;s unrealistically way too long or way too short will break immersion.

**HEADING OF THIS SECTION:[[footnote]] You can separate the document into sections as you see fit. In the original document, the author included two requests at the top and then the rest of the document was summaries of the phenomenon&#39;s current status. Your document may or may not need this feature. [[/footnote]]**

3. More points.

4. Oh god the points. We&#39;re very pointed here. In the case of documents such as this that have two pages, you may use a &#39;page wrap&#39; sort of effect by ending a paragraph in mid sentence

and continuing the point over on the next page. Be sure to check the line length when doing this, since the Wikidot text input box may not show you when a line actually ends, and you&#39;ll look like a derp if the line ends arbitrarily.

5. Another point is being made here. Such point. Very anomalous.

6. Side note: Most of these documents make use of Arabic and Farsi/Persian terminology nearly-interchangeably. This is because ORIA, while based in Iran principally, extends its effective sphere of influence across a much larger area. ORIA is the principal authority over anomalous phenomena in the Middle East, with substantial influence as well in northern Africa (competing with the Foundation, Chaos Insurgency, and Manna Charitable Foundation to a lesser extent), Central Asia (competing with the Chaos Insurgency and GRU-P), and the Indian subcontinent (almost certainly competing with somebody). ORIA has agents of many nationalities, religions, ethnicities, and native languages, and most of them should be fluent in at least either Farsi/Persian or Arabic.

7. POINTS

8. The last point may include date and time of transmission.

**OUT OF UNIVERSE NOTES, FOR REFERENCE**

[[collapsible show=&#34;History of the Organization&#34; hide=&#34;Hide&#34;]]

The Indo-European world has always had a strong tradition of magic, sorcery, and anomalous phenomena. One can presume that, as with the ASCI and HMRSCP in the West, there were precursor organizations, groups, or even individuals throughout the Middle East and West Asia who worked to harness those powers. The **Organization for the Reclamation of Islamic Artifacts**, or ORIA, coalesced in the post-World War II era as the foremost independent agency in the Mideast for anomalous phenomenon containment and documentation, centered in Shemiran, Tehran Province, Iran. After the Iranian Revolution of 1979, ORIA was (out of necessity) folded into the new Revolutionary government as the **Islamic Artifact Reclamation Directorate**; this title, however, is used primarily on government documents and the old name is more likely to be used and recognized in casual conversation.

The relative political stability and independence of Iran throughout the 19th and 20th century left it the last stable place where such an effort could be based. As such, ORIA has strong ties throughout the Mideast across religious, national, and tribal lines; they have alliances with Sunnis as well as Jews, Christians, and assorted pagan groups (the hidden Neo-Zoroastrian enclaves in particular). The Revolution in 1979 changed little for the organization as such; the less diehard-fundamentalist Muslims began pretending outwardly to be so in order to match new political realities, but nobody in the new government is quite willing to tamper with ORIA&#39;s traditional autonomy so long as ORIA makes no attempt to influence the Revolution. Which it doesn&#39;t; some members of the organization have left-wing, atheistic, or anti-Ayatollah tendencies, but //all// of the organization is strongly loyal to their homelands -- Iran in particular, but also other Mideastern nations, local tribes, clans, or families -- and the group is mostly apolitical in nature.

//OOC note: This is a key difference between ORIA and the Foundation or GOC, with whom they share some methods and procedures but a remarkably different goal. ORIA doesn&#39;t care about &#34;normalcy&#34;; they care about protecting and advancing their homeland(s) from and against external threats. To the extent that ORIA cares about secrecy, it&#39;s to avoid external sabotage and interference; to the extent ORIA cares about scientific advancement, it&#39;s directed towards helping their people and families. ORIA has absolutely no qualms about helping, using, exploiting, manipulating, or cooperating with anomalous phenomena so long as the protection of their sphere of influence is maintained, their people are helped, or the West is pushed out or kept away. This extends also to cooperation/interactions with other Groups of Interest; ORIA will work with anyone that can advance its interests and opposes anyone that threatens them. Pragmatism, first and foremost, is their watchword.//

[[collapsible show=&#34;The Djinn&#34; hide=&#34;Hide&#34;]]

The latent reality-bending power of otherwise nonanomalous humans has been a topic of some discussion, but little evidence has ever been presented to prove the existence of this power. Regardless of formal evidence, an unusual phenomenon spread around the Middle East in the mid seventh-century, coinciding with the formation and spread of Islam. Sentient memetic organisms developed throughout the Muslim world around the conception of &#34;djinn&#34; as developed by the new Muslim ruling class. The rapid spread of Islam and the Quranic beliefs produced a massive change in localized human consciousness; the sudden conquest and conversion of so many humans in such a short period of time created a manual reality-bending effect, conjuring or consolidating sentient, independent, humanoid creatures throughout the Dar-al-Islam. These beings, numbering in the tens of thousands, often emerged near the Middle East and Mesopotamia, including Persia; this is due to the strong Arab/Muslim influence in their corporeal incarnations. 

Many of the great geniuses of the Western/Middle Eastern world for the next several centuries, the ones who maintain the great works of classical Greece and Rome through the Dark Ages, are, in fact, //djinn//. Because //djinn// are memetic in nature, they are idea-based and can infiltrate into human minds, usually through code phrases or incantations; this is responsible for the common idea that //djinn// can &#34;possess&#34; individuals and force them to do their bidding. This is hampered by the fact that infiltration into a human mind is consistently rather painful for the //djinn// (being creatures of pure idea, immersing themselves in a human mind would be like a human being diving head-first into a swamp filled with naked, screaming strangers, with no definite method of escape) and can lead to total loss of identity, insanity, and death. Typically, only experienced and trained //djinn// attempt infiltration.

Though the existence of //djinni// are technically supported in the Qu&#39;ran as creations of God, they have often been persecuted and attacked throughout history due to their relatively alien nature and less-than-stellar reputation as non-human entities. As a result of this persecution, several feuds erupted between several //djinn// Houses and the Muslim-controlled Khwarezmid Empire, the rulers of Iran beginning in 1077 and for several centuries onward. While the Khwarezhmids vastly outnumbered the //djinn//, the //djinn//&#39;s ability to infiltrate and subvert imperial officers allowed them to spark a war between the Khwarezmid and Genghis Khan in the thirteenth century. However, the Mongol invasion of Iran backfired horrifically for both sides, slaughtering fully 90% of the population of Iran, placing the Iranian people under Mongol control for centuries, and giving the Khans both battle experience and geographic access to invade Europe and Northern Asia. In the wake of this horrific war, the surviving //djinn// houses began cooperating with indigenous humans to a greater extent than ever before; though the //djinn// remained underground to avoid outside investigation, they recognized that protection of their homelands necessitated a degree of mutual trust, respect, and cooperation with their neighboring humans. This loose alliance continues to this day; ORIA recruits //djinni// as operatives, both due to their enhanced abilities and their greater familiarity with the paranormal. These operatives are classified as &#34;Type 2 Special Personnel&#34; in official documents.

(//OOC Note: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Iran#Mongol_invasion_.281219.E2.80.931221.29 More or less happened], except for the// djinni//. Also, I&#39;m more than open to less clunky ways of expressing &#34;THESE ARE GENIES&#34; in documents; it gets awkward having to spell out &#34;Type 2 Special Personnel&#34; over and over and over again.)//

The //djinn// form several Houses in order to support and govern themselves as an underground society within early Medieval Mesopotamia. The Houses play different roles in the lives of their members; some serve as almost religious centers, others simply fraternal organizations. The oldest and most powerful of these is the House Afsaneh, established somewhere in western Persia (now Iran). Access to the House is restricted solely to those //djinn// that are members of the House or invited guests; knowledge of the physical location of the House is restricted solely to higher-order &#34;clergy&#34; within the organization; these are common traits of the most powerful Houses. Other prominent houses include the intellectual but cold //djinn// of House Roxelana in western Turkey, the cosmopolitan (some would say hedonistic) and comparatively liberal //djinn// of House Nabhani in Oman, and the militant monk //djinn// of House Khotan in the mountains of Outer China. The Houses are allied in a loose confederation; cooperation and some degree of politeness can be expected for an ORIA operative interacting with //djinni// anywhere, though whether this represents real friendship or simple politeness depends on the House.

//OOC note: To create a djinn House for interaction: a) locate any area that was predominately controlled by Muslims at any point in history, b) identify an intimidating, relevant, or historically justifiable proper noun for a name, and c) develop a set of relatively unique traits that the House can be &#34;known for&#34;. That last is sort of cheap and you can probably forgo it if you want.//

Whispers are spoken of a failed attempt by Tamerlane in the 14th century to establish a //djinn// House somewhere outside of Eurasia, but these //djinn// were believed to be lost at sea.

//OOC note: They landed in Australia.//

[[collapsible show=&#34;Writing Style&#34; hide=&#34;Hide&#34;]]

Documents depicting ORIA activity take the form of communiques, memoranda, and other documents being transmitted between ORIA headquarters in Shemiran -- identified by the codename &#34;Jannah&#34;, the Arabic word for heaven or paradise -- and operatives throughout the world. These documents typically reflect the attitudes and beliefs of their authors and are neither written for mass consumption nor edited later for such a purpose. As such, the concept of &#34;clinical tone&#34; as applies to scientists is inapplicable here. The tone mostly just needs to be justifiable from the perspective of the author as well as the recipient; someone reading the document has mostly likely already read and has access to other documents about the same event, region, or phenomenon. For this reason, documents can be written with phrasing that assumes the reader is familiar with some concepts and does not need full description.

In the example of Memorandum 0117 Regarding Project 025, the box on the upper-left corner of each page identifies, in order, the primary &#34;case&#34; being discussed in the document (&#34;Project 025&#34;), the codename of the case (&#34;Nowhere Guard&#34;), the codename of the primary ORIA operative in field command over the operation or situation (&#34;Ibn Rushd&#34;), the author of the memorandum in question (&#34;Bijhan&#34;), the destination of the memorandum (&#34;Jannah&#34;), the number of the memorandum in the file of this particular &#34;case&#34; (117) and number of that page out of the total (P1/2). The information at the beginning of the document identifies the rank and identity of the author, the specific identity of the intended recipient (&#34;Jibril&#34;, from the Arabic word for the Archangel Gabriel, represents the office of the director of ORIA; &#34;Jibril Actual&#34; represents the director himself), the subject, and any documents enclosed with the document being written here.

//(OOC Note: You might wait until after writing the rest of the document out to fill these last two parts in; nevertheless, I think they add a certain realistic touch to the document, and work much the same as including a reference to an Addendum in an SCP even if the Addendum is never included itself; it hints at a part of the communication that the reader has no access to.)//

The rest of the document is written out in numbered paragraphs. In the above document for Project 025, the first two paragraphs are notes of particular importance, either because the author felt they were or because the author was instructed to look into those matters first.  The numbering is largely arbitrary and mostly reflects a series of separate points that can be referred to in future memoranda. Document should end with a sign-off from the author.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Other Notes&#34; hide=&#34;Hide&#34;]]

Random bits of canon here:

The current director of the present incarnation of ORIA is Parviz Jafari, a &#34;retired&#34; general of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. Jafari experienced an encounter with unidentified flying objects during his time in the Imperial Iranian Air Force in 1976 and was convinced from that point on of the existence of paranormal or non-conventional phenomena; this attracted the attention of ORIA, who recruited him shortly after the Revolution.

//(OOC Note: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_Tehran_UFO_incident Really happened.])//
