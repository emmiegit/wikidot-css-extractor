Hello! I&#39;m RealSurrealSir. Welcome to my author page(let)!

If you can&#39;t tell immediately, this is still in --construction-- **A S S E M B L Y** as of now until whenever I feel satisfied with it, should such a hypothetical event occur. 

Until then, I have both more articles to write and IRL stuff that matters even more.[[footnote]] Or so I keep reminding myself, to mixed results.[[/footnote]] In the meantime, for those both interested and uninterested-but-should-be,-take-my-word-for-it,[[footnote]]As estimated by an anonymized, survey of all RealSurrealSirs presently existing as me personally.[[/footnote]] check out all three of my articles:

[[[SCP-6094]]] - How to Spell //Lorem Ipsum// 
[[/=]]
-----
Style: Dark Humor, with Horror elements. 
-----
&#34;//Yep! Honestly it&#39;s been a fun couple weeks for the most part. You haven&#39;t lived until you watch a possum piss on a businessman&#39;s laptop in Starbucks while a raccoon pulls out the guy&#39;s wallet as he&#39;s too angrily distracted to notice.//&#34;

[[collapsible show=&#34;■ Commenatary ■&#34; hide=&#34;□ I&#39;m done. □&#34;hideLocation=&#34;both&#34;]]
My first article, not anything especially high-brow or overly conceptual; I wasn&#39;t trying to avoid an ambitious first SCP, It&#39;s just that the ambitious idea I&#39;ve been working on for months is not remotely ready and I kind of wrote this one mostly while taking a break to focus on something more darkly whimsical. I&#39;m //moderately// proud of it anyway.

[[[SCP-6460]]] - The Harvester&#39;s Labyrinth
[[/=]]
-----
Style: Horror, Creepypasta(esque)
-----
[[collapsible show=&#34;■ Commenatary ■&#34; hide=&#34;□ I&#39;m done. □&#34;hideLocation=&#34;both&#34;]]
My second-most recent article, but personally also my proudest so far. Just really like how it turned out, and certainly best pre-post feedback Ive gotten so far on and off-site. There was a lot of tinkering over time, but I think I finally got the eerie, building creepiness that suddenly escalates even-when-you-thought-was-done kind of flow that I was always going for. Overall, darkest/most serious SCP ive done so far.

[[[SCP-5496]]] - Site-43 Suggestion Box
[[/=]]
-----
Style: Dark Humor, with absurdist elements.
-----
&#34;//While this file has been given a default clearance level of three for all other sites and posts, all Site-43 employees have been given special provisional level 1/5496 clearance to view the bulk of this file. All employees are to read this file at least once, and to be proactively apprised of any significant updates as necessary. Additionally, monthly weekly reminders are to be given to all Site-43 staff that any complaints, issues, or suggestions relating to perceived issues with some aspect of their workplace environment are to be directed through the appropriate channels via Hiring and Regulation; and that there is not now, nor has there ever been, any sort of officially sanctioned Site-43 “Suggestion Box.”//&#34;

[[collapsible show=&#34;■ Commentary ■&#34; hide=&#34;□ I&#39;m done. □&#34;hideLocation=&#34;both&#34;]]
My second article, even more low-brow/removed from classical &#39;horror&#39; tropes, other than the &#39;bad genie&#39;/&#39;monkey&#39;s paw&#39;. Certainly my most simplistic SCP concept so far of both of published and partially-drafted ideas, it nonetheless ended up being the most fun to write. I had the idea originally, almost immediately thought it was a bit too silly to lend itself to a classic SCP article, then almost immediately after //that// remembered that my favorite/second-favorite canon,[[footnote]]It&#39;s kind of a tie to be fair, I can never decide whether I most love S43 or Anti-memetics Division (the first canon I actually finished when first getting into the SCP universe) more. Depends on mood.[[/footnote]] **[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/on-guard-43-hub On Guard-43 Canon Hub]**, exists, and might actually be the PERFECT setting to incorporate his unrelated quasi-whimsical idea of a malevolent suggestion box.

Style: Banal Horror, with dark humor elements.

&#34;//SCP-6566-2: So first off, did you guys happen to bring your own ritual daggers?//

//Stacy: …I’m sorry, wh—//

//SCP-6566-1: That’s Ok, we should have a couple that the kiddos can borrow. (shouting) HEY KING? CAN YOU GRAB A COUPLE DAGGERS?//

//A door in the back opens, and SCP-6566-3 walks out holding an ornately crafted dagger in each hand. Agonized screaming can be clearly heard from behind the door, though no one present remarks or noticeably reacts to this.//&#34;

My first entry in DepartmentCon 2022, as part of the Demonics Division team.[[footnote]]AKA Faustian Jargon[[/footnote]] It&#39;s a bit longer and more traditionally disturbing than my first two, but the subject matter kind of necessitates that and it&#39;s more the style I want to be writing in as a default in the future, anyway. More DD stuff coming very soon though, so stay tuned.

[[[SCP-6850]]] - Fireball/Flame Orb
[[/=]]
-----
Style: Humor, character piece
-----
&#34;H.R. Weigl: No SCP-6850, I haven’t seen the show “Avatar: Last of Airbenders, people who totally had coming,” and so I can’t tell you why “Everyone so mean to Fire Nation” as I believe you so elegantly put it.

SCP-6850: Just is baffling to me.

H.R. Weigl: What I CAN tell you is that you won’t get to find out either if you don’t focus, because I gave you your TV privileges but can just as easily take them away.

...

SCP-6850: Is just… Why don’t other element peoples just accept their superiors as rightful leaders and be happy for opportunity?&#34;

[[collapsible show=&#34;■ Commenatary ■&#34; hide=&#34;□ I&#39;m done. □&#34;hideLocation=&#34;both&#34;]]
Most recent article, and first attempt at something more wholesome(ish). Noticed theres a lot of SCP files focused on anomalous or anomalous-affected children, but not much on //child-like anomalies//. Why should sapient non-human objects and entities almost always be mentally/emotionally comparable to adults?

[[[SCP-6957]]]
[[/=]]
-----
Style: humor, or new weird I guess?
-----
//T + 00:59 - SCP-6957 reaches out and then makes a vague arm motion around the balloon to no noticeable effect, before donning a look of apparent confusion. However, shortly thereafter, the camera’s field of view into the front of the alley where SCP-6957 and the child are then located is slightly obstructed by a passerby, shielding SCP-6957 from its line of sight for approximately 0.6 seconds. As the pedestrian continues on, the footage then shows what had previously been a balloon had now been replaced with a metal helium gas tank, still attached to the same string.

T + 01:05 - The helium tank is seen falling onto the head of the child’s doll, causing part of its head to cave in and its left arm to come off...//

Decided to try my hand at a Prof. Funtastic/Tiny Señor. There really isn&#39;t a ton to say about this one, it&#39;s supposed to be an easy and fun read, but it&#39;s pretty simple in concept and execution.

**Why the theme, are you super into cogwork orthodoxy or something?**
Not really; I like it as much as the next luddite cult, don&#39;t get me wrong, but I mainly just really like this theme. 
@@ @@
**Did you mean to adjust the main title but leave the secondary the same?**
No, I tried to change both but only one took. (Currently seeking more knowledgeable person to tell me how to fix it...)
@@ @@
**Do you write elsewhere?**
Great question, hypothetical fellow human! Yes(-ish), I also write short horror stories on reddit, mainly /nosleep. Same Username.
@@ @@
**Do you have a real name?**
Yep! Next question.

**How did you get into the SCP Universe?**
Accidentally, as with most good things in this world. I was watching a Youtube video on some thought experiment,[[footnote]]I thiiink it was Roko&#39;s Basilisk?[[/footnote]] and the guy explained the concept of an infohazard. I thought that was really neat, so I of course went and read the Wikipedia page on &#34;infohazard,&#34;[[footnote]]As one does.[[/footnote]] which mentioned its use in this thing called the //SCP Foundation// universe. Guess where I went next?

**What&#39;s your top 5 SCPs?**
I&#39;ll do you --one-- two better, and list my favorite from each series because why not! Ok, so:
