**Special Containment Procedures:** Site-462 has been constructed around the town of Alancakaranlik. All instances of SCP-6395-Beta are allowed to freely roam within the town and the surrounding farmlands. No instance of SCP-6395-Beta is allowed within Site-462 research buildings.

Lead Foundation researchers Dr. Rouland and Dr. Nautilus have been given complete jurisdiction over site activities and research projects regarding SCP-6395. 

A barbed-wire tipped fence has been constructed along the border of the local farmland to contain SCP-6395 from the outside world and let SCP-6395 be aware of its borders.

**Containment Update:** Following the events of Operation Cocuk Şafak, Site-462 has been expanded upon, and Foundation research buildings have now been constructed along its perimeter. A three-kilometer standard containment perimeter has been constructed along the borders of the town proper and its local farmland. A total of ten watchtowers have been assembled along the border wall and should be manned at all times to help prevent any attempts at a containment breach. 

----

**Description:** SCP-6395-Alpha is the designation for an anomalous entity currently inhabiting Alacakaranlik, a town in present-day Turkey. Alacakaranlik had been relatively isolated from the rest of the world since the manifestation of SCP-6395-Alpha until its discovery and subsequent containment by the SCP Foundation in 1998. SCP-6395-Alpha is a hivemind-like entity that, as of yet, has not been found to have a central point of origin or physical manifestation. It is only found to be present in the bodies of SCP-6395-Beta instances. 

SCP-6395-Beta is the classification given to all of the inhabitants of Alacakaranlik, which was last documented to consist of 784 instances. Each instance of SCP-6395-Beta is genetically human with no physical differences from a baseline human.

Any action made by an SCP-6395-Beta instance had been instructed by SCP-6395-Alpha. Despite each instance of SCP-6395-Beta seeming to have their own personality with unique desires, fears, and speech patterns, it is necessary that all Foundation personnel stationed at Site-462 remember that these behaviors are all performed by SCP-6395-Alpha.

SCP-6395-Alpha finds enjoyment in having the SCP-6395-Beta instances act as if they were unique individuals. SCP-6395-Alpha has claimed that it is trying to create a community within itself stating that it is a &#34;director.&#34; For a reason not fully understood, SCP-6395-Alpha does not like to talk to Foundation personnel directly.[[footnote]] When trying to talk to SCP-6395-Alpha, it is recommended for Foundation personnel to instead reference the &#34;community&#34; as this will elicit a welcoming response [[/footnote]]

[[include component:image-block name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/10_Lira_%28Turkey%29.jpg/1920px-10_Lira_%28Turkey%29.jpg|align=right|width=35%|caption=A coin used as currency by SCP-6395-Beta instances]]

Actions that SCP-6395-Alpha performs with instances of SCP-6395-Beta include but are not limited to: 
* Child instances of SCP-6395-Beta attending &#34;school.&#34; 
* The use of the Ottoman Lira[[footnote]] The form of currency used by the Ottoman Empire until the currency was debased in 1923 by the current Turkish Lira [[/footnote]] as a form of currency to trade goods amongst itself
* Making small talk amongst other instances
* Arguments between SCP-6395-Beta instances 
* Lying to other instances about what a topic, and other instances then falling for such fabrication even though they should be aware that such claims are incorrect since they are incorporated into the SCP-6395-Alpha collective
* Instances marrying each other, with the age difference between partners not exceeding two years. [[footnote]] All pairings to date are between male and female partners. Why there is a lack of other pairings in the &#39;community&#39; that SCP-6395-Alpha is creating is, as of yet, unknown. [[/footnote]]

Before Site-462 was built around Alacakaranlik, the town had been self-sustaining with zero external assistance in trade, electricity, or other social or political factors that a structured town would usually require. The town has a limited electrical grid and little access to modern technology. SCP-6395-Alpha is not allowed access to the internet, computers, television, or phones.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
During a systematic geographical study of the local terrain by Foundation personnel, a high Hume level was documented in the area. A Foundation research team assisted by a small MTF went to the site to find the town of Alacakaranlik existing at the location of the Hume abnormality.

[[tab Interview Log-6395-1.0]]
**The following is a transcript of the conversation between Dr. Rouland and SCP-6395-Alpha**
----
An SCP-6395-Beta instance is escorted towards the Foundation research team, which has already begun setting up a provisionary encampment at the edge of town. This is present one hour after arriving at Alacakaranik. 

**Dr. Rouland:** Hello there, sir. My name is Dr. Rouland; I have been told you are the &#39;mayor&#39; of this town? 

**SCP-6395-Alpha:** Why yes, madam, I indeed am the mayor of this fine town. Although, I would like to talk to the man in charge if you don&#39;t mind.

**Dr. Rouland:** Speaking. I am the &#39;man in charge.&#39; Now I have a few questions for you. Why is this little town not documented on any of our maps.

//SCP-6395-Alpha looks confused at Dr. Rouland&#39;s remarks and looks around at the other researchers, seemingly expecting something to happen//

**SCP-6395-Alpha:** Well, um, in any case, our town, Alacakaranlik, is entirely self-sufficient. We do not need any outside help.

**Dr. Rouland:** Well, regardless, we have reason to believe that there is something unprecedented happening here, and we&#39;ve come to assist

**SCP-6395-Alpha:** Concern? I don&#39;t recall anything strange happening as of late. Oh, wait, our crop yield this year has been a little lower than usual but is nothing out of the ordinary. 

[[/tab]]
[[tab Interview Log-6395-1.1]]

**The following interview was conducted in an interrogation room with an instance of SCP-6395 sitting at one end of a table and Dr. Rouland at the other end**
----
//The SCP-6395 instance is slumped over with its hands rested against its face//

**SCP-6395:** I can not believe this. H-how were you able to figure it out? A-and not only that, you managed to figure it out in a matter of days. I thought I was doing an excellent job with my play. 

**Dr. Rouland:** Well, I&#39;m sorry to inform you 6395-Alpha, but your acting skills are not stellar. Despite having done an impressive job crafting so many unique... characters. You left many similar character traits in each of them. They were minimal things that were done subconsciously. It&#39;s tough to detect, but we were able to figure it out with how many people you are demonstrating. Now SCP-6395-Alph-

**SCP-6395:** Vanessa. Please, her name is Vanessa. I&#39;ve spent too long creating these characters just for people to dehumanize them.
 
**Dr. Rouland:** Yeah, I am not going to do that. I am talking to you, SCP-6395-Alpha. I am not talking to the body in front of me, I&#39;m trying to talk to you, and I mean //all// of you.

//Dr. Rouland spreads out her arms wide and rotates slightly as if to refer to the surrounding environment//

**SCP-6395:** I will allow it. I guess I have not spoken with another individual myself in a very long time. 

**Dr. Rouland:** Good, and now that you mention it, I have to ask. Why do you persist in pretending you are a bunch of different people. 

**SCP-6395:** I don&#39;t know. I like acting is all. This town is like a stage, and I&#39;m its actors, directors, and its spectators all at once.  

[[/tab]]


[[tab Audio Log-6395-1.2]]
**The following is a video had been taken outside Research Building-462. The individuals present are Dr. Rouland and two instances of SCP-6395-Beta. The two instances are going to be designated SCP-6395-Beta-1 and -2.**
----
**SCP-6395-Beta-1:** As the mayor of this humble town, I just want to thank you pleasantly for letting us continue to live here. I don&#39;t think the hearts of the townsfolk would be able to handle the idea of leaving their homes behind.

**Dr. Rouland:** Please, there is no need to thank me. As per the conditions we agreed to, you are welcome to act however you&#39;d wish as long as you do not try to leave.

**SCP-6395-Beta-1:** You are very generous for that, and I promise on behalf of the townsfolk that we will not betray your trust. As a token of our gratitude, please accept this gift.


**SCP-6395-Beta-2:** We picked the ripest and plump apples for our local orchard. I hope they are to your liking.
//SCP-6395-Beta-2 steps forward before bowing and presenting a basket of apples.//

**Dr. Rouland:** Thank you, I hope this is a sign of good relations moving forwards.
[[/tab]]

[[/tabview]]

During the events in the interviews above, the other instances of SCP-6395-Beta continued to react and function as usual, doing routine tasks and talking amongst themselves. 

Given Dr. Rachel Rouland&#39;s proven negotiability with SCP-6395-Alpha, she has been assigned to be the head researcher of Site-462 and subsequently, SCP-6395. Any Foundation projects regarding SCP-6395 are to be approved by Dr. Rouland before being enacted.

++++ **Addendum 9/12/2003**

 It has been discovered that there is a limit to the amount of control SCP-6395-Alpha has over the SCP-6395-Beta instances.

While SCP-6395-Alpha can control and characterize hundreds of SCP-6395-Beta instances at once, the scope of its precision is limited. When an instance of SCP-6395-Beta is not participating in a task that requires a significant amount of motor function and is not related to social interactions of any kind, the instance will appear to be in a &#34;Lost State.&#34; The instance will typically remain stationary, or if it were doing an action, it would continue to do said action indefinitely, appearing not to be aware of its surroundings.

The staff has reported that the eyes of instances in said &#34;Lost States&#34; will move around, seemingly at random. 

If any individual approaches the instance and attempts to interact with it will cause the effect to stop, and the instances will go back to doing what they were doing prior as if nothing has happened. SCP-6395-Alpha claims to have no recollection of the events. While the frequency of these events is uncommon, research into these &#34;Lost States&#34; is advised.

------

**Addendum 2006-08-09:** Due to the increase in the size of Site-462 in recent years, Dr. Nautilus has been tasked with co-leading as department head of Site-462 alongside Dr. Rouland to keep management oversight at a sustainable level.

++++ Message to all Staff Stationed at Site-462 

I have no idea what is happening at this site, but changes need to be made immediately. I see countless facts about SCP-6395 that have very little research sunk into it despite the abode of scientific discoveries just waiting to be uncovered beneath its thin surface. 

As your new co-manager, I would like to say that scientific discovery is on the horizon. We are going to be doing some real work from here on out. We must do what we can to find out the true extent of this anomaly and its capabilities to better Secure, Contain, and Protect it.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**The following are a series of messages between Dr. Nautilus and Dr. Rouland over the nature of SCP-6395**
----
**Dr. Nautilus:** This can not possibly be all the information we have on the entity? Do we only have interviews with it?

**Dr. Rouland:** Well yeah. What&#39;s there to test exactly? There hasn&#39;t been much to experiment with this entity; it&#39;s just a typical mind-affecting anomaly.  

**Dr. Nautilus:** What are you talking about? 6395-Alpha is able to mimic hundreds of unique personalities simultaneously! This is another level of multitasking that is entirely beyond human capabilities!

**Dr. Rouland:** Well yes, we already have established lots of data on how it can hold multiple conversations at the same time regarding completely different topics. What else would you want to see? 

**Dr. Nautilus:** I want to see the extent of these capabilities! How well can it continue to act out all of these personalities when under high-stress levels? Does it even have the capacity to continue its motor functions over so many instances when confronted with high-level problems!

**Dr. Rouland:** This seems a little unnecessary; let&#39;s just continue with our interviews

**Dr. Nautilus:** Absolutely not! Scientific advancements only come to those who work hard! This could be a breakthrough in the study of consciousness and awareness!

[[collapsible show=&#34;Open Sensory Test Logs-03&#34; hide=&#34;Close Sensory Test Logs-03&#34;]]

Sensory Test Log-03 was conducted using two D-class, D-323 and D-324. The D-class were each given a knife, and a sufficient amount of construction-grade cable ties to restrain multiple individuals. D-323 was also given a gun loaded with blanks. The D-class was informed of the blanks in the gun before the experiment. 

The D-class were given explicit instructions not to mention the Foundation in any capacity. They were instructed to sneak into the town during nightfall and attempt an assault on a preestablished house consisting of a family of three SCP-6395-Beta instances, a father, daughter, and newborn infant. The D-class was told to try and tie up the family in the house first and then wait for authorities to arrive in the form of Foundation personnel who would apprehend them. 

**Results:**

[[tabview]]
[[tab Assult Response]]

The day before D-class testing, multiple hidden cameras were set up in the designated building that the D-class would assault. A description of the video feed caught on these cameras is attached below 
&gt; SCP-6395-Beta-1, who will be referred to as &#34;daughter,&#34; is shown sleeping in her room on the second floor across the hall from the staircase. SCP-6395-Beta-2, who will be referred to as the &#34;father,&#34; is also shown sleeping in his room on the second floor next to the stairs. SCP-6395-Beta-3, referred to as &#34;infant,&#34; is resting in the father&#39;s room cradle.
&gt; 
&gt; The two D-class approach the front door and open it.[[footnote]] SCP-Alpha does not lock the doors of the houses in Alancakaranlik. Only ever doing so on rare occasions. [[/footnote]] The D-class check all of the first-floor rooms before moving up to the second floor.
&gt; 
&gt; When they have accounted for all three instances of SCP-6395-Beta, they attempt to restrain the father while he is sleeping. The father immediately starts fighting back but is overpowered by the two men who manage to tie him down with the cable ties. As the two D-class attempt to tie them down, the daughter instance ran into the room carrying a bat and hit D-323 in the leg with it. 
&gt; 
&gt; The D-class falls over momentarily before turning his attention to the daughter. He attempts to overpower her by landing solid punches on the girl. It didn&#39;t appear to work, so he stabbed her in the arm. The instance seemed to wince and stagger back at this. At this point, the D-class tackled her and tied her up.
&gt; 
&gt; After the two D-class had tied up both of the instances, they noticed that SCP-6395-Beta-3, the newborn infant, had managed to get out of its cradle and was attempting to scratch at the feet of D-324. The D-class did not appear in pain as the scratches left no visible mark. He picked up the infant and put it back in its cradle. 
&gt; 
&gt; The father and daughter resisted against their bindings for about a minute before they gave up. Both of them had been gagged with clothes to prevent any form of speech. With the two instances tied up, the D-class left the bedroom and went downstairs, where they started talking about what they were supposed to do next. At this point, the cameras stationed outside the property revealed several instances of SCP-6395-Beta coming into frame approaching the house. 
&gt; 
&gt; The D-class were unaware of this and only noticed when the new instances of SCP-6395-Beta were only a few meters from the front door. Over 300 instances of SCP-6395-Beta are in the frame outside the building and are beginning to enter the house from both the front door and the back entrance. 
&gt; 
&gt; The D-class, now visibly frightened and yell at the instances to stay back and pulls out his gun. At this point, the closest instances of SCP-6395-Beta rush the two D-class. The D-324 shoots his gun; however, the blank pullets do not affect the SCP-6395-Beta instances.
&gt; 
&gt; The two D-class are both overwhelmed by the Beta instances that proceed to physically assault the two D-class. The instances all clamber together in attempts to reach the D-classes, but most don&#39;t have space to reach them. 
&gt; 
&gt; After 2 minutes of being assaulted by the hoard of SCP-6395-Beta instances, the two D-class both appear to fall unconscious. The instances continue to bludgeon the unconscious D-classes before ending their assault. At this point, some of the instances began to tie up the D-class, and some went up to the second floor and untied the father and daughter. 

No instance of SCP-6395-Beta was found to have spoken a word during the entirety of the experiment 

After the events of Sensory Test 03, a pair of SCP-6395-Beta instances came to the Foundation research building at Site-462, informing personnel of an altercation that had taken place. This is the first time reported where SCP-6395-Alpha spoke to Foundation personnel in the first person without being asked. 

D-323 and D-324 were sent to the medical wing and signed away to another Foundation site. 

[[/tab]]
[[tab Inactive Response]]

The following logs were caught on a body camera attached to Security Personal &#34;Bravo&#34; during the events of Sensory Test 03. 

&gt; Footage begins with the camera pointed at Dr. Nautilus alone at the intersection of two roads. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Bravo:** Sir, the test is about to begin. We need to get you out of here as per safety precautions.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nautilus:** We&#39;ll head back in a little bit. I want to see some of this firsthand.
&gt; 
&gt; **Bravo:** What?! Are you crazy? It could get dangerous, and we don&#39;t want to risk you getting hurt.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nautilus:** Hey, nobody got hurt in the last two experiments. How can this be any different? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Bravo:** You know why this test will be different. 
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Nautilus attempts to start walking away from Bravo; however Bravo grabs the doctor by the arm. Dr. Nautilus struggles against the agent&#39;s grip.  
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nautilus:** H-hey! Let go of me this instance, Bravo! That&#39;s an order!
&gt; 
&gt; **Bravo:** No. I was tasked with protecting you. We are getting out of here. 
&gt; 
&gt; The camera turns in the opposite direction of where Dr. Nautilus was walking. Street lights light up the street, and no living things are seen on the road. The camera shacks lightly momentarily at the initial resistance of Dr. Nautilus, but it quickly stops. The next 30 seconds of footage show the two walking down the road for about 70 meters in silence before the front doors of nearby houses open up. SCP-6395-Beta instances walk out onto the streets and begin to walk in the opposite direction that Bravo and Dr. Nautilus were walking. Bravo and Dr. Nautilus start speaking in whispers. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Bravo:** What the hell? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nautilus:** It seems like the test must have started. 
&gt; 
&gt; The two Foundation personnel stop walking as the SCP-6395-Beta instances walk around them. None of the instances acknowledge the agents&#39; presence, with their eyes fixated on a location ahead of them. An instance of SCP-6395-Beta walks into Bravo, causing him to stumble back. The instance seems to have not been phased by said interaction and continues its steady advance. After a few moments, Dr. Nautilus and Agent Bravo start walking alongside the SCP-6395-Beta instances. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nautilus:** This is exciting behavior, isn&#39;t it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Bravo:** What? No, it&#39;s not. This is really creepy actually.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nautilus:** Hey! Look at that!
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Nautilus walks into the frame of the body camera and points in the direction of a house on their left. The camera shifts view to a traditional two-story home with its front door open, and all of the lights appear on within it. A humanoid entity is shown pressing itself against one of the first-floor windows.
&gt; 
&gt; **Bravo:** What the hell? Is that one of ours? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nautilus:** What, of course not. Now come, we gotta check it out!
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Nautilus pushes past some instances of SCP-6395-Beta and makes his way to the front door. He peers inside before turning toward the camera and motions Bravo forwards. Bravo makes his way through the 6395-Beta instances, and as he does, Dr. Nautilus goes out of frame. Agent Bravo enters the house and turns in the direction of the figure in the window to see that it is an SCP-6395-Beta instance with the appearance of a middle-aged male. Dr. Nautilus is standing next to the instance, observing it. The SCP-6395-Beta instance is pressing its body against the wall, and its legs and feet are walking forward as if it was walking in an open area. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nautilus:** Now, this is quite interesting. I don&#39;t think 6395-Alpha&#39;s paying much attention to him.
&gt; 
&gt; **Bravo:** I-I&#39;m sorry? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nautilus:** Like, look at this thing! 6395-Alpha hasn&#39;t even noticed that it&#39;s walking straight into a wall. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Bravo:** But why, or should I say how?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nautilus:** I am not too sure myself. Maybe this is what one of those &#34;Lost States&#34; looks like. 
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Nautilus taps the instance on the shoulder 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nautilus:** Hey, Alpha, you awake in there?
&gt; 
&gt; The SCP-6395-Beta instance elicits no outwards response. Dr. Nautilus pokes it again to no response. Dr. Nautilus then grabs the instance by the shoulder and pushes it back slightly, causing the instance to fall over limp. Dr. Nautilus jumps back in response.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nautilus:** Oh my god! 
&gt; 
&gt; Bravo moves over to the SCP-6395-Beta instance, quickly giving the camera a clearer picture of its face. Its face is covered in red marks due to the friction of pressing its face up against the glass. Its eyes lids are open and unblinking, and the irises are in a constant state of motion, looking all around the room seemingly at random. Dr. Nautilus waves his hand in front of its face, ostensibly to draw its attention, but its eyes continue their erratic movements. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Bravo:** I think we broke it
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nautilus:** It looks so scared. The way it&#39;s moving its eyes.
&gt; 
&gt; The SCP-6395-Beta continues to lay limp for several despite Bravo and Dr. Nautilus&#39; efforts to get to a response of any kind. Bravo turns towards the window and looks outside. In the distance, several SCP-6395-Beta instances are seen now walking down the street toward them.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nautilus:** Hey, his eyes stopped twitching! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Bravo:** I think we have to go. The people are coming back towards us!
&gt; 
&gt; Bravo turns back towards Dr. Nautilus and the limp 6395-Beta instance. The 6395-Beta instance&#39;s eyes are trained on Bravo, with its eyes still unblinking. Its hands begin to shack, and its head twists from side to side. Its hands then turn into fists before once again falling limp. Agent Bravo turns away and runs to the front door. As the camera is fixated on the front door, Dr. Nautilus is heard screaming, and Bravo turns around to see Dr. Nautilus having fallen over onto his back. He is staring at the SCP-6395-Beta instance, which is now flailing its limbs about. A couple of seconds later, the 6395-Beta instance stops whipping its arms and legs around and sits up. It turns to face Dr. Nautilus.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6395:** Oh my god! Dr. Naut, I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re here! Some thug just tried to attack my people! We need your help!

**The following are the audio files recorded during a meeting between Dr. Rouland and Dr. Nautilus**
----

**Dr. Rouland:** I really think you need some rest, Alex. You have been in the office all day since the last test. 

**Dr. Nautilus:** You didn&#39;t see what I saw, Rouland. You weren&#39;t there. The way it looked at me.

**Dr. Rouland:** I saw the footage. It wasn-

**Dr. Nautilus:** It wasn&#39;t caught on the footage! That bastard wasn&#39;t looking when it happened! Its eyes, its damn eyes! T-there was something more in there. I don&#39;t know how to describe it. 

**Dr. Rouland:** Hey, you need to relax a little. You are talking nonsense, and this entity isn&#39;t human. You&#39;ve said it yourself, it&#39;s just mimicking different personalities simultaneously. Of course, it looks at us differently.  

**Dr. Nautilus:** This was different Rouland. I know it was. SCP-6395-Alpha never looked at me like that before, and just as it had... I don&#39;t think it was 6395-Alpha that was looking at me.

**Addendum 2006-10-23:** The documents regarding Subconscious Tests are only authorized to personnel with Level-3 clearance or above. 

[[collapsible show=&#34;Open Subconscious Test Logs-02&#34; hide=&#34;Close Subconscious Test Logs-02&#34;]]
Subconscious Test-02 was undertaken with the intent of manually triggering a &#34;Lost State&#34; occurrence. To do this, a controlled environment was designed that would be able to maintain SCP-6395-Alpha&#39;s attention in its entirety. This has been proven difficult given the extent to which SCP-6395-Alpha can disseminate its awareness. 

**Control Environment:** A mass public gathering would be held in the town square of Alacakaranlik. This event took the form of an art fair, in which several different plays would be held simultaneously. SCP-6395-Alpha was exceedingly engaged when informed of the proposed public gathering and requested that it may take part in it. Request was granted.

In preparation for the public gathering, SCP-6395-Alpha had written four original scripts that it would later play out during the experiment. This resulted in over 200 instances of SCP-6395-Beta being used as actors and another 700 SCP-6395-Beta attending the event. The art fair would last 7 hours.

As the control procedures were undertaken, Foundation personnel were tasked with searching the town for SCP-6395-Beta instances seemingly in a Lost State. After the control environment was active for over 5 hours, an instance of an SCP-6395-Beta instance in a Lost State was found. 

**Additional Information:** Memetic Specialist-Agent &#34;Lima&#34; would be present for Subconscious Test-02
* Foundation operative granted with the anomalous ability to read the minds of individuals after Experiment █████████

The following footage was captured on the body camera fixated on Dr. Nautilus&#39;s jacket at his previous request. 

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

Dr. Rouland, agent Lima, and Dr. Nautilus walk into a single-story suburban home and walk over to a dining room. An SCP-6395-Beta instance is standing on a chair facing a brick wall. The Beta instance is a female with an appearance estimated to be in her twenties. Dr. Nautilus and Lima walk up to the instance and bring it down from the chair and onto the floor.

**Lima:** So this is the skip you wanted me to read?

**Dr. Nautilus:** Yes, it&#39;s definitely in a Lost State, look at its eyes.

**Lima:** Before I do this, I just want to let you know. I&#39;ve never read a hivemind before, so I have no idea what I&#39;m going to see in there.

**Dr. Rouland:** You probably aren&#39;t going to see anything. Regardless, I&#39;m sure the results will be interesting.

Agent Lima walks in front of the 6395-Beta instance, puts both hands on its shoulders, and closes his eyes. No movement occurs except for the continuous eye movement of the 6395-Beta instance for the next thirty seconds. Lima proceeds to bare his teeth and begins to groan. His groans quickly increase as he and the SCP-6395-Beta instance both begin to vibrate. Lima starts to scream as his ears start to bleed. The 6395-Beta instance begins flailing its head violently, seemingly at random. Dr. Rouland is now screaming from off-camera as the 6395-Beta instance&#39;s legs appear to give way, and it collapses onto the floor as it begins to shriek while continuing to shake its head violently. Lima crumples onto the floor and puts his hands to his face as he continues to scream in pain.

**Dr. Rouland:** Hello?! Hello!? We need a medical team right now! I said right now god damn it!

The 6395-Beta instance begins flailing its arms and legs around violently as it continues to scream. Agent Lima starts foaming at the mouth and begins shaking violently.

[[/div]]

All personnel involved with Subconscious Test-02 were rushed to the medical wing of Site-462. Agent Lima died the hours following the experiment at 3:23:01 2006-10-24. Dr. Rouland and Dr. Nautilus received no injuries.

The SCP-6395-Beta instance, which will from this point onwards be referred to as SCP-6395-Gamma, was also brought to the medical wing of Site-462. It continued to scream and flail its limbs around and had to be sedated. When examined by medical staff, 6395-Gamma appeared to have no internal or external injuries. Despite heavy sedation, SCP-6395-Gamma awoke one hour after being put into the medical wing. When SCP-6395-Gamma awoke, it was silent for roughly five minutes before it began to cry, scream, and flail its limbs again like before it was sedated. SCP-6395-Gamma&#39;s limbs were quickly restrained to the bed it was lying on.  6395-Gamma continued to cry and thrash against the restraints for over twenty minutes, during which time Dr. Rouland and Dr. Nautilus were informed of its current state.  

After Dr. Nautilus and Dr. Rouland entered SCP-6395-Gamma&#39;s room, the following audio logs were recorded.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
The sound of SCP-6395-Gamma crying continues for the first ten minutes of the recording. The crying gradually becomes softer until finally, the sounds of the weeping end. The following two minutes are mostly silent, with only the ragged breathing of SCP-6395-Gamma being heard. 

**Dr. Rouland:** Um, hi there... um, Gamma. How are you feeling? Would you like to talk? 

There is silence over the next thirty seconds. 

**Dr. Nautilus:** The look you are giving us. I-I&#39;ve seen it before. It was only for a moment but-

**SCP-6395-Gamma:** R-r-real?

**Dr. Nautilus:** I&#39;m sorry?

**SCP-6395-Gamma:** Is... Is... this... real? 

**Dr. Rouland:** Um, yeah, this is real? What do you mean by that?

**SCP-6395-Gamma:** I-I hated you. 

**SCP-6395-Gamma:** Y-you all are monsters. I-its been years. I&#39;ve screamed for help for years. And you did nothing.

**Dr. Rouland:** You&#39;ve talked to us before? I-I don&#39;t think-

**SCP-6395-Gamma:** I want water. Give me water. Give me water. Give me water! Give me water! GIVE ME WATER! GIVE ME WATER! 

**Dr. Nautilus:** Water? Ok, I&#39;ll get you some water.

SCP-6395-Gamma keeps repeating the phrase, talking over Dr. Nautilus, and begins to shake its head around.

**Dr. Nautilus:** I said I&#39;ll get you some water, just give me a second!

**Dr. Rouland:** Here, just take mine

SCP-6395-Gamma stops talking, and loud slurping sounds can be heard. 

**SCP-6395-Gamma:** Y-you gave me water, I drank... I drank the water. 

SCP-6395-Gamma begins to cry softly again.

**SCP-6395-Gamma:** T-this really is real. I-I-I can&#39;t...

**Dr. Nautilus:** What are you talking about? What do you mean by &#39;This is real?&#39;

From this point onwards, SCP-6395-Gamma speaks in a cracked voice, as if trying to hold back tears.

**SCP-6395-Gamma:** I-I can&#39;t control myself. I can&#39;t control me. Nobody can. I wanted to play outside when I was younger, but I couldn&#39;t. I&#39;ve never could. Not...Not until now.

**Dr. Rouland:** You couldn&#39;t control yourself? Do you mean with SCP-6395? 

**SCP-6395-Gamma:** Yes, I never could... nobody can. I want to do something, but I never do it. I&#39;m not me. He was me. They are not them. He is them. We are one. We act as one. 

**Dr. Nautilus:** You mean every one of the SCP-6395-Beta instances is the same? Is that what you are trying to say?

**SCP-6395-Gamma:** No, no, they are not the same. I wasn&#39;t even the same as myself. //It// is the same though. It controls us. It makes our movements, it eats our food for us. It made me eat broccoli all the time, I hate broccoli. We have no will, it is our will. I&#39;ve tried to fight back. I&#39;ve always fought back. But nothing changes. I kept doing stuff I did not want to do. Everything I say, I didn&#39;t say, it was //it// that says my words. I was always there. I was always crying, always running. But I never cried, and I never ran. Instead, I would laugh, instead I would sit.

**SCP-6395-Gamma:** M-m-my son. I never knew him. I never knew anyone. My son, he&#39;s not real! I-I want to know my son. I want to know my son! I WANT TO KNOW HIM!!! 

The sound of a class mug is heard smashing at the other side of the room.

**SCP-6395-Gamma:** I want to know my son!!! Why can&#39;t I!?! H-he doesn&#39;t look at me like I am his mother. H-he looks at me like an adult, a stranger. T-there is no love in him! I-I could not love him! He made me barely see him! H-he&#39;s always in the other room.  He never loves me, I never loved him. 

**Dr. Nautilus:** What the hell...

**SCP-6395-Gamma:** B-but I do love him. I do. H-he must be so scared. He is so scared. He&#39;s so alone, I-I needed to be there for him. But I could not, it would not let me. Instead, it make me do other task. I-I didn&#39;t want to. I-I&#39;m no mother. I am horrible.

**SCP-6395-Gamma:** I-it hurts... it never feeds us right anymore. It never notices if it feeds me too little. It never notices. It makes me work, and I am so thirsty, and water is close, but it makes me work. It hurts so much. I want to eat some more, it&#39;s always too little. It used to be enough... but farm food is not enough, we never have enough... I don&#39;t even think it knows it&#39;s not enough. 

There is silence for the next five minutes as SCP-6395-Gamma cries again. 

**SCP-6395-Gamma:** Make it stop! M-make it stop! The others. Others still can&#39;t move, make the others move. Please. Please let them scream, let them cry... let them do... let them do what wants. Just let them do what wantings. Please... please...

**Addendum 2006-11-12:** Since the manifestation of SCP-6395-Gamma, SCP-6395-Alpha has made several requests to have SCP-6395-Gamma be returned and all requests have been and will continue to be denied. SCP-6395-Alpha has become uncooperative with the Foundation. While it is not directly hostile towards Foundation personnel, SCP-6395-Alpha has attempted to breach containment twice since the manifestation of SCP-6395-Gamma.

A request by Dr. Rouland to sterilize all instances of SCP-6395-Beta is pending.

[[collapsible show=&#34;[Operation Cocuk Şafak - Incident Report]&#34; hide=&#34;Operation Cocuk Şafak&#34;]]
**Date:** March 4, 2007

**Division Involvement:** Operation Cocuk Şafak was a joint operation between Site-462, [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4043  |MTF Iota-5 &#34;Brainiacs&#34;]]], and MTF Rho-14 &#34;Body Snatchers&#34;
* MTF Iota-5 is a task force comprised in its entirety of telepaths with specialized training suited for communicating with beings of a high level of consciousness.  
* MTF Rho-14 is a task force specialized in reconnaissance and retrieval missions of non-anomalous objects from areas of interest. 

**Incident Report**

//03-01-2007:// MTF Rho-14 arrived at Site-462, where they had time to thoroughly investigate the town of Alancakaranlik. 

//03-03-2007 19:00-19:30:// MTF Iota-5 constructs a ritualistic site in a wheat field north of the town. Requiring the burning of 15 cubic meters of grains. Foundation Security Personnel were tasked with protecting the perimeter of the ritual.  

//03-03-2007 21:00:// SCP-6395-Alpha noticed the ritual being performed, and about 50 instances of SCP-6395-Beta approached the site with frustration, complaining about fire damages. Security Personnel successfully prevented any altercation from occurring. 

//05-04-2007 1:30:// MTF Iota-5 begins ritual. Upwards of 200 instances of SCP-6395-Beta gathered around the ritualistic site and attempted to physically assault security personnel to stop the procedure. 

//05-04-2007 1:40:// All instances end hostilities with Foundation personnel and begin communicating with an unobserved entity. SCP-6395-Beta instances start speaking through the point of view of SCP-6395-Alpha. 

//05-04-2007 1:41:// MTF Rho-14 is deployed into the suburban region of Alancakaranlik, searching homes for child instances of SCP-6395-Beta in a Lost State

//05-04-2007 1:43:// The first instance of SCP-6395-Beta is brought to Research Building-462, and the first use of an M-SRA was performed outside of testing.

//05-04-2007 2:10:// All instances of SCP-6395-Beta stop communications with the unobserved entity, and all instances begin to physically assault personnel across the site. 

//05-04-2007 2:15:// Use of lethal force is authorized by Dr. Nautilus to prevent a containment breach. 

//05-04-2007 3:05:// SCP-6395 is re-contained, and all remaining Foundation Personnel were evacuated. 

------

**Results:** Operation Cocuk Şafak is considered a failure, and any future attempts to alter SCP-6395 are forbidden. Twelve Foundation staff were killed in the ensuing violence, including Dr. Rouland herself. This loss of life could have been avoided if standard containment procedures had been followed. All units in MTF Iota-12 had to be given Class-A amnestics following the operation due to mental health concerns. Also, let it be reminded that the Mobile Scranton Reality Anchor is still in __very early stages__ of development, and staff are forbidden from mentioning the project.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Interviewer:** Dr. Tarik Aydin

**Interviewee:** Dr. Alexander Nautilus 

----
**[Begin Log]**

**Dr. Aydin:** Dr. Nautilus, how are you doing today

**Dr. Nautilus:** I&#39;m doing fine. You know, I keep hearing people say that the operation was a failure. Why are people saying this? We succeeded!

**Dr. Aydin:** I&#39;m sorry? 

**Dr. Nautilus:** You heard me. Operation Cocuk Şafak was a success god damn it! We saved the lives of thirty-four kids! How is this not a success? 

**Dr. Aydin:** You used a Mobile SRA, which, let me remind you, is still in its early stages of development, to mess with an anomalous entity. It went critical, Alex! Four personnel and fifty-one instances of SCP-6395-Beta were killed in the resulting temporal breach. How did you even get your hands on this?! 

**Dr. Nautilus:** Look, Tarik, those people are suffering. They&#39;re living in a constant state of fear, anger, who knows what kind of emotion! It&#39;s not ethical to keep them like that! Even if we manage to save the lives of only a hand full of kids. We&#39;ve made the situation better. 

//The next thirty seconds of audio recording are silent//

**Dr. Nautilus:** Has my request been sent up?

**Dr. Aydin:** Yes, and you&#39;ll be delighted to know it&#39;s been approved. All of the remaining SCP-6395-Beta instances will be sterilized. Are you happy now?

**Dr. Nautilus:** Ah, that&#39;s good. That&#39;s really good, actually.

**Dr. Aydin:** You know Alex, I&#39;m sure you could have gotten it approved without causing that shit show.

**Dr. Nautilus:** We didn&#39;t do this to get them sterilized. We did it because it&#39;s the right thing to do.
