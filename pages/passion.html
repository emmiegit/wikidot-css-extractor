&gt; Hey Mom,
&gt; 
&gt; This might seem like a suicide note but it really isn’t, I promise you I’m still alive even though it doesn’t seem like it. Remember the story you told me about myself? When I was a child, you’d place toys all around me and a little pillow in the centre of that toy-circle, and I’d spend entire days playing with them, and falling asleep in it. You made me a little world and I must have really liked it, because I never truly escaped. Thank you for staying at home and cooking for me. Whenever I feel unmotivated to continue studying you’ll always come and chat me up and tell me how much you love me. Thanks for that too. I know you expected great things from me: you wanted me to become a lawyer and get rich, find a good wife and let you carry my baby. You probably expected me by your death bed, holding your hand and sending you off. But I’m sorry. I know it’s not your fault, you just wanted the best for me, but I really can’t handle it anymore. I always fear the disappointment you’ll feel when you see me getting an F on my subjects and I know it’s just not possible for me to live the grand lifestyle you have envisioned for me. Lately, I’ve been writing some stuff for a site and I’ve started to really feel alive again, just like when I was in that little toy-world as a child. I also finally found friends there! They all love the site as much as me and it&#39;s so fun to talk to them, they don&#39;t feel fake and pretentious like the sons of your gossip-friends. I haven’t felt this real for so long, there&#39;s just this deep emptiness inside me all the time when I do anything apart from writing, doing anything that you expect me to do. This life of being loved and having a good future doesn’t suit me. I finally found a way to live with my own passion and creations! This is a last goodbye note because I have a feeling that I won&#39;t see you ever again. Thanks for all that you have done for me and I’m sorry I was a disappointment and never achieved anything until the end.
&gt; 
&gt; Desmond
