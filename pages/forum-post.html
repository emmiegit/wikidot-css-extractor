&gt; ++++ __Insisting Containment is Unethical Hurts Anomalies, Not the Foundation__
&gt; 
&gt; //**Posted:** Friday, October 25th, 2024 09:09 | **Author:** Jasper ███████//
&gt; ,,//**Category:** Opinion/Discussion | **Topic(s):** North Carolina State Law, Human(oid) Containment//,,
&gt; 
&gt; On Tuesday, House Representative Moria Lucas (I-NC) proposed a bill which, if made into law, would require the Foundation to release human anomalies from custody if a given anomaly had not experienced in the past six months a flareup of any effects which would violate NC law if taking place in public[[footnote]]“effects which are both uncontrollable and unpredictable and have the potential to affect physical objects, physical laws, and/or living organisms within a reasonably close range of the effect’s source” (NC APP 4-C6-NC ¶A)[[/footnote]]. Understandably, this attracted the attention of several anomalous peoples&#39; rights organizations and reporting agencies -- including but not limited to the Serpent&#39;s Hand and anti-Foundation legal firm Leeward &amp; Warner Legal Solutions, as well as Information Breach Publications -- who were quick to voice their support for the Representative&#39;s bill.
&gt; 
&gt; [[[a-day-notable-to-nobody|I]]] am a Type E Class II Scranton-Type Human Anomaly; put simply, that means reality doesn&#39;t function correctly around me, and the &#39;Type E&#39; part indicates that I have no control over when or how the effects occur. With November just around the corner and every candidate for any party factoring their stance on the Foundation into their campaigns, I find it a pressing matter to explain why forcing the Foundation to follow an external government&#39;s delegations for containment is a //dangerous idea.//
&gt; 
&gt; 89% of my effects can be countered with a specific type of technology -- a Scranton Reality Anchor -- and empirically tracked using a unit called a [[[and-this-one-explains-humes|Hume.]]] (The other 11% of my effects aren&#39;t understood by the Foundation nor I -- and nor were they by my second cousin on my mom&#39;s side, who was the only other person in my family to ever experience said effects.)
&gt; 
&gt; It is only by result of this equipment that I am not in danger on any given day; I did not always have these effects, and if Foundation personnel had not been present the day they first manifested, I and several (more) other people would be dead. If the equipment in question were not fixed in an array that completely surrounds me when I am in my chamber (one device is connected to a grid which is inlaid in the walls, floor, and ceiling), there&#39;s a good chance I could fall straight through the solid material of the ground for a few hundred meters and rematerialize in the same physical space as the bedrock, or create a localized spatial anomaly &#34;less real&#34; than the surrounding room and get trapped inside of it long enough to starve because time progresses 400 times slower inside of it, or experience any number of other dangerous issues. (Both of those examples are true and happened to anomalous civilians in 2022 and 2023 respectively; Type E reality benders are the second-most-common type of human anomaly, so none of this should be news to the politicians that claim to be knowledgeable about such issues.)
&gt; 
&gt; Despite all this, I have not experienced a flareup of my effects in more than six months. Thus, Representative Moria Lucas would want me living on a residential street, because she does not comprehend what containment actually is or what purpose it serves for someone like me. I haven&#39;t had a flareup //because Foundation personnel are doing their jobs// -- and they need to keep doing them in order to continue my safety. Containment is not a temporary procedure that fixes all of someone&#39;s problems. It is not a treatment, it is an ongoing scientific challenge; the personnel designing the procedures are not doctors, but something closer to engineers; Site-42 is not a hospital nor a prison, it is just a facility designed to accommodate me and people and things like me as safely as possible, because the world outside //can&#39;t// accommodate me. To the Foundation, I am someone affected by forces out of my control, and their goal is to help me live as normally as I can in the environment demanded by my circumstances.
&gt; 
&gt; If made into law, this legislature would override both the Foundation&#39;s wishes and mine; as the anomalous person, the government would not //allow// me to stay, even if that were what I wanted. According to Rep. Lucas, the reasoning behind this is the notion that a contained human anomaly&#39;s environment and heavily regulated lifestyle prevent them from being able to discern what is best for them. While even the Ethics Committee recognizes this line of reasoning and shares those concerns (albeit applied to different issues), I question how Lucas could encourage //government// intervention in good faith. What reason has American government given me to trust them over the Foundation? Who is objectively more knowledgeable about how to help me?
&gt; 
&gt; And lastly: I find disturbing the lack of attention given by media or politicians to nearly any anomalous intervention organizations //other// than the Foundation. If I were forced to live offsite, I would immediately be at risk of kidnapping, assassination, violence or assault, and all of the above or more at the hands of groups like the Chaos Insurgency, Global Occult Coalition, etc. The fact that the suits and cameras only want to focus on the people whose goal is to protect me from the former groups and from my own effects continues to baffle me. And before you call me delusional or whatever, the past five years have //not// been 100% smooth sailing; I remember myself falling for the &#34;they&#39;re brainwashing you&#34; shit only a couple years ago and putting up a fight with them about every single thing. Looking back, there wasn&#39;t one time they weren&#39;t willing to put up with my shit, and hindsight is 20/20.

&gt; This is facts right here. Jasper&#39;s received ethical treatment by the Foundation -- good for them, but politicians like Lucas aren&#39;t thinking about lapdogs like them when they draft these laws, they&#39;re thinking about all the people who have been held against their will, experimented on, etc. There do exist anomalous people that //want and can control// their effects, and the Foundation has taken them too on many occasions; we can&#39;t erase those experiences in favor of oh-so-heartwarming perspectives like OP&#39;s. This //is// probably a real anomaly talking in this post, but it&#39;s one who&#39;s never seen the pre-public-judgement Foundation. (You know, the //real// Foundation.)

&gt; ##blue|@NYC anon, I&#39;ve been assigned to *them a few times before. Their effects are exacerbated by panic and stress symptoms -- particularly the 11% we don&#39;t understand that they talked about in that post -- but are otherwise manageable so long as the ambient Hume level immediately around their person is stabilized to close to baseline, which is within the capabilities of a portable SRA. Thus, it&#39;s entirely possible to walk outside with them for a short period of time, and we do this whenever they ask for it. They&#39;re opposed to permanently leaving because using a portable anchor is not foolproof and definitely needs one of us close by in case something goes wrong.##

Currently, the 11% unpredictability is a barrier to safely containing them offsite; were there to be an accident, neither Jasper nor we would want it to occur around civilians rather than within a facility that is designed to withstand anomalous events.##

&gt; @Kentucky anon no, there&#39;s no reason to argue that... Jasper is clearly sapient and capable of self-awareness. To indicate otherwise is an insult to their intelligence. They&#39;ve had five years of experiences and they want to share what they&#39;ve concluded from those experiences, they are not in the wrong for &#34;getting political&#34; when the politics in question affect them personally. that said I can see how the whole post sounds fake/too good to be true -- and if we even have to question if it&#39;s real, well, that proves a point in and of itself...

&gt; The number of people suggesting that Jasper somehow isn&#39;t allowed to have a pro-Foundation opinion speaks volumes louder than any censorship of anomalous people the Foundation may be perpetuating. This is //their// life. Listen to them about it.

&gt; ##blue|Okay, this is getting off-topic. While the driving influence behind the 2024 Open Communications Program is accessible information, personal identifying information was left out of that post for the anomaly&#39;s safety, and insistence that said details should be disclosed in order to prove the individual&#39;s legitimacy is not acceptable. Furthermore, the Foundation does not and cannot publicly endorse nor speak ill of election candidates; the opinions in this thread&#39;s opening post are the anomaly&#39;s alone. The anomaly&#39;s assigned personnel will log this and show them a relevant and appropriate selection of responses, as was intended; thank you for your engagement and interest, and we apologize for any inconvenience.##
