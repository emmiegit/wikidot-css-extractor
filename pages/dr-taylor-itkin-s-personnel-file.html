**Author Thoughts:**
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ SCP-3864&#34; hide=&#34;- HIDE&#34;]]
So, [[[SCP-3864]]], my first article on the site. Honestly, when I was writing this, I was surprised it wasn’t already on the site. A painting that sucks you in and uses your colors as “paint” seemed so...Series I to me at the time. It still does, honestly, but the addition of the narrative (while thrown in at the end, admittedly) does change that a bit.
I get a lot of mixed opinions on the pictures, but honestly, I just make most of my own pictures because it’s a lot easier to avoid copyright issues. It’s just a simpler process.
While I was writing SCP-3864, I was rediscovering why I enjoyed the Foundation. The style it’s in, horror/abnormality presented in a cold, matter-of-fact tone has always fascinated me, and the Foundation is the best place to find that.
The concept of SCP-3864 came from a combo of [[[SCP-099]]] and...well, I guess you could call it “Foundation logic”. It just seemed like something that belonged in the Foundation.
The characters of Lenny and Terry were made up on the spot and because of my desire to have a gay D-Class love story, and nothing more.
I think that SCP-3864 ended up being executed well, but it could have been better, with the narrative being thrown in at the end. I might end up changing it sometime.
[[/collapsible]]
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ SCP-3524&#34; hide=&#34;- HIDE&#34;]]
Ah, [[[SCP-3524]]], the forest sprites. Yeah, that’s what they are, but I guess it’s up to interpretation. Anyway, the idea for 3525 actually came from Sea Monkeys, originally. At first, they were little terrariums that appeared in pet stores with complete civilizations inside. That idea expanded into what it is today.
Now, as for Jomuź, the language. I get a loooot of shit for that, considering that I used a program called Vulgar to “create” it. I bought the full version of the program, which allows me to customize pretty much everything, and then arranged the letters of the alphabet I chose into different words, and generate the dictionary and charts (with information I gave it). I understand how some people can think that’s cheating, especially with how much Jomuź is featured in the article, but I still did all the work myself in translating, writing, structure-forming, and conceptualizing the language. I consider it my creation.
The idea for the -B instances, the cult, came because I wanted a rapid shift of tone to come in the article. The idea that such peaceful, pleasant organisms could turn into cannibalistic hellspawn just because of some lack of space was a fun idea.
Despite the shortcomings, I actually think that 3524 is my best work on the site so far (as of only having 3 articles up). It shows a clear improvement from 3864 in which I’m able to implement the narrative without having it entirely in interviews at the end, as well as expansive world building. I’m extremely proud of it, and I don’t think I could ever feel differently.
[[/collapsible]]
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ She Waits&#34; hide=&#34;- HIDE&#34;]]
So, [[[She Waits]]] was not a huge article for me. I’m not super sure where the inspiration came from, to be honest, but it was a spur of the moment kind of thing. I just kind of...wrote it.
I wanted to experiment a bit with format, but not too much, which is where the colors came from. I wanted to try and show the emotions of the surviving woman in a bit of a more unorthodox manner. The colors are supposed to represent her emotions at the given moment that they appear. While what color represents what emotion is a highly subjective thing, I think that the colors chosen represent them pretty well. As well as that, the emotions are still up to interpretation and I hope that the colors themselves provide different views on the story progression.
It’s relatively short and written in a strange kind of prose, but I think it’s actually fairly decent writing.
[[/collapsible]]
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ The World Within&#34; hide=&#34;- HIDE&#34;]]
So, [[[The World Within]]] was actually something I&#39;d been planning to write ever since I wrote [[[SCP-3864]]]. I knew I wanted to explore the inside of the painting, and I knew I wanted to follow one of the more &#34;obscure&#34; characters in the article (Dug is actually mentioned once in the interview logs on 3864). I wanted to &#34;continue&#34; the story while providing a bit more context.
I worked with a few authors on IRC (check the discussion page for the tale) to see what everyone&#39;s headcanon for the world inside of the painting actually was. I wanted to The World Within to be my interpretation, but not so much that it ruined the immersion for other readers.
In my mind, the world in the painting of SCP-3864 is a single room (my family room cuz of the pictures tbh) with two windows, side by side. Inside the room, everything looks and feels real- though is unmistakably paint if you look too far into it. Outside, out the windows, is a completely different world- one that is so obviously made of paint you can&#39;t ignore it. Think of the crayon-world from the Ib video game- that&#39;s the same kind of vibe I was going for.
The biggest challenge I had in writing this was the format-screwy-ness. The purple text is meant to represent the &#34;fake&#34; daughter Tanya. The blue is an MTF agent, the orange is the doctor. The teletype was actually meant to represent whenever the painting itself was influencing the article or the character. I think the whole area with ^^th^^is kind,,a stuff i,,s better left to interpretation, although I know what it means for me.
And yeah, I wrote this in about...16 hours before I posted it? 4 drafts and lots of crit.

**Real Info:**
What&#39;s up, guys, my name is Taylor (duh). I&#39;ve been lurking on the site since Series II was beginning, and I finally decided to join this year and try my hand at writing some actually decent SCP articles. I&#39;ve always been a decent writer, but SCP has brought me levels far beyond what I thought I could achieve.
I love to play guitar, write (no shit), write music, sing, act, hang out with my friends, and other generic teenager shit. I&#39;m glad to finally be a part of this community and hope I can contribute meaningfully.
