**Item #:** SCP-093

||**Object Class:** Artifact||**Containment Class:** Euclid-messoremi||
||**Threat Level:** Aquamarine ##00e9c1|⬤##||**Shape Class:** Circular||
||**Color Class:** Red ##red|⬤##||**Favorite Food:** Chicken Parmesan||

**Special Containment Procedures:** No further tests of SCP-093 are to be conducted. SCP-093 is stored in a containment cell at Site-19, on a mirrored pedestal. Personnel entering this cell are to be attached to tethers. Unauthorized access to SCP-093 is to be punished with termination __of medical benefits__.

**Description:** SCP-093 is a red disk composed of a cinnabar-like material. Symbols of unclear origin are etched into one face of the disk. When held in a human palm, SCP-093 will emit a soft, colored hue. The correlation of the hue to the person holding it is unknown; it is currently believed to be related to the owner&#39;s political party.

When SCP-093 is placed on the ground without a holder, it will transport itself to the nearest mirror. It normally does this by spinning until it has gained enough rotational speed to fly towards the mirror in a similar fashion to that of a helicopter. It is able to gain enough speed to break through walls in some cases. Despite the speed SCP-093 often moves at, it does not deal any noticeable damage to the mirror.

**Additional Notes:** All records of SCP-093 prior to Dr. Feldman&#39;s investigation are lost: see Original Documentation for more information. See attached documents for testing logs.

||**Original Documentation**||

&gt; **Item #:** SCP-093
&gt; 
&gt; **Object Class:** Euclid
&gt; 
&gt; **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-093 is to be placed on a silver mirror atop a pedestal made of the finest wood from the Californian redwood forest. This mirror and the pedestal are to be replaced on a biweekly basis. Also, the cell is to be made out of telekill, just in case.
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** Object was found on the shore of the Red Sea on 30 Jan 1968, during one of Dr. Chester&#39;s many trips to the Mediterranean in pursuit of more effective containment methods. Upon discovery, it appeared to be emitting a blue glow.
&gt; 
&gt; Investigation of SCP-093 was halted after Rsr. Simmons, Dr. Chester&#39;s research assistant, mysteriously disappeared after coming forward with accusations of fraud. Ever since SCP-093&#39;s containment at Site-19, it has assumed a purple hue. Containment procedures were formulated by Dr. Chester, who determined that the ideal mirror supplier to contain SCP-093 is Chester Mirrors Incorporated.

||**Testing Logs**||

After Dr. Chester was fired for embezzlement, SCP-093 was planned to be thrown out as, like many of the other anomalies Dr. Chester &#34;discovered,&#34; it was believed to be a clever combination of magnets and glowstick fluid. However, after being placed in the trash can, researchers were surprised to see SCP-093 rocket out of the trash can, break through the ceiling, and &#34;attack&#34; Dr. Jeffrey in pursuit of the lavatorium mirror. Testing of SCP-093&#39;s anomalous capabilities began shortly thereafter.

**Mirror bought from the nearby Pottery Barn:** SCP-093 seemed to have no preference for the cheap mirror over the mirrors created by Dr. Chester. At least we can cut that from the Site&#39;s budget.

**Two mirrors apart from each other:** SCP-093 rotates in a tight circle on the test room floor, before spinning like a top towards one of the mirrors at random.

**A mirror made of cinnabar:** SCP-093 flips itself into the air onto the standard mirror. No noticeable deviation.

**A mirror in the shape of a disc:** No noticeable deviation.

**A mirror containing a reflection of the 2003 movie //Disc// being played on LaserDisc:** No noticeable deviation.

//Why are we doing this? We already know it flies into mirrors. We&#39;ve got more important things to do than play with a disc all day. Leave it on a mirror and move on.// - Dr. Goodman

**A human holding SCP-093 making contact with a mirror:** This test was accidental; Dr. Goodman was passing through the Department of Mirrors on his way to SCP-093&#39;s new containment area, and slipped on the Department&#39;s immaculately clean floors. When holding SCP-093, mirrors apparently act as a portal to another realm.

**Additional Notes:** Mirror testing is now suspended. Investigation of SCP-093&#39;s newly discovered anomalous property will commence after Dr. Goodman&#39;s hip surgery.

||**Testing Log 2: Mirror Boogaloo**||

Exploration of the area beyond SCP-093 commenced shortly after testing.
