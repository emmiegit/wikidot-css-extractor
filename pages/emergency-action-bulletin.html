&gt; + {{EMERGENCY BROADCAST 001}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{The United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), in conjunction with the United States Department of Defense (DOD) and the Office of the President of the United States, has issued a Code 102-01 Emergency Action Bulletin for all United States territories. **##red |THIS IS NOT A DRILL. SEEK SHELTER IMMEDIATELY.##** It is vitally important that all citizens in affected areas listen to government instructions and remain vigilant at all times.}} 
&gt; 
&gt; {{**INFORMATION FOLLOWS**}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{At 5:21 PM Eastern Standard Time, several unidentified aircraft entered US airspace above the Florida and Georgia regions. The aircraft are believed to have first been detected by local radar and air traffic control entering the Florida coastal areas from the Atlantic Ocean. The FAA has been unable to determine the origins and nationality of the pilots, though deducing such information assumes they belong to a recognized political state. Aircraft demonstrate properties inconsistent with any known commercial or military vehicle and are capable of achieving extremely high velocities. It is believed at least some of these aircraft are bearing explosive, biological, or chemical payloads.  }} 
&gt; 
&gt; {{Please remain in your emergency shelters and await further instructions from FEMA. If you do not possess an emergency shelter or are in a public area, seek out a basement or other subterranean structure immediately. It is currently not known if or when the next emergency broadcast will be transmitted. It is unlikely that emergency services will be available for some time. Additional information will be transmitted as it becomes available. }} 

&gt; + {{EMERGENCY BROADCAST 002}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{The United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), in conjunction with the United States Department of Defense (DOD) and the Office of the President of the United States, has issued a Code 102-01 Emergency Action Bulletin for all United States territories. **##red |THIS IS NOT A DRILL. SEEK SHELTER IMMEDIATELY.##** It is vitally important that all citizens in affected areas listen to government instructions and remain vigilant at all times.}} 
&gt; 
&gt; {{**INFORMATION FOLLOWS**}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{At this time, FEMA is able to confirm that the aforementioned unidentified aircraft have successfully delivered multiple biological payloads throughout the continental United States. Known targets include New York, Detroit, Los Angeles, Boston, Orlando, Miami, Atlanta, and Honolulu, though other cities may be affected as well. Due to the nature of this situation, government resources are strained. It is not known when government operatives will be able to perform search and rescue operations in affected regions. The payloads delivered by these aircraft appear to be gaseous, toxic substances that will induce serious injury or death if inhaled. Limited field reports suggest some HAZMAT suits and filtration apparatuses are capable of reducing or negating exposure to the gas. Under no circumstances should you expose yourself to the gas, intentionally or otherwise. Remain in your shelter until further instructions are issued. }}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Note that the gas appears to be colorless, odorless, and partially translucent. There will be little to no indication that an area is affected by the gas. The early signs and symptoms of exposure to the gas are not known at this time. For your safety, avoid all public areas indefinitely.}}

&gt; {{The United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), in conjunction with the United States Department of Defense (DOD) and the Office of the President of the United States, has issued a Code 102-01 Emergency Action Bulletin for all United States territories. **##red |THIS IS NOT A DRILL. SEEK SHELTER IMMEDIATELY.##** It is vitally important that all citizens in affected areas listen to government instructions and remain vigilant at all times.}} 
&gt; 
&gt; {{**INFORMATION FOLLOWS**}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{This is a reminder to remain in your emergency shelters indefinitely. Ignore all sounds you believe may be emanating from immediately outside your shelter. Ignore any &#34;knocking&#34;, doorbell ringing, or other indications that somebody may be attempting to gain access to your shelter or the encapsulating structure. Ignore any vocalizations not made by members of your party. Remain as silent as possible at all times. Avoid excess emission of sound, light, and odors. Ignore any personnel requesting access to your shelter or claiming to be an affiliate of the United States government.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{It is imperative that your shelter remain sealed at all times. If you believe an unidentified individual has entered your shelter, immediately seek out a sealed room and lock the door. Do not make any noise. Do not compromise your location in any way. Further information will follow.}}

&gt; 
&gt; {{**INFORMATION FOLLOWS**}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{This is an emergency broadcast. This is not a drill. It is vitally important that you listen to all information that follows.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Immediately locate a sealed, opaque, preferably isolated room within your shelter.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Ensure all members of your party are within the aforementioned room. Lock the door from inside and barricade it with any available materials.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Ignore all noises not created by you or your party. Sounds that you believe may be originating from within the room are most likely misleading.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{If you begin to experience fatigue, shortness of breath, or audio/visual hallucinations, cover your nose and mouth. Ensure you are facing a solid wall. Remain in a fetal position with your head as far from the other members of your party as possible.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{If you see an unidentified figure within your shelter, immediately close your eyes and remain motionless. Do not make any noise whatsoever. Breathe through your nose slowly to ensure you are as quiet as possible.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Should any member of your party be unaccounted for, even if you were maintaining direct visual contact with them prior to their disappearance, do not attempt to search for them. Remain calm, silent, and motionless at all times. Any movement or noise will compromise you and your party&#39;s safety.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{No further emergency broadcasts will be made.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{This has been an emergency broadcast transmitted by FEMA.}}</textarea></pre>
