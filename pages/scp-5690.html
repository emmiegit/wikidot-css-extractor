**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to its location inside [[[SCP-4661]]], SCP-5690 is under the jurisdiction of Site-666. As outlined in the Covenant[[footnote]] A contract that is spiritually binding to demonic and empyrean entities. [[/footnote]] between the Foundation and SCP-5690-B, the Foundation will prevent local authorities from disturbing SCP-5690&#39;s operation. In exchange, SCP-5690-B will remain inside the city limits and provide transparency into its business practices. 

**Description:** SCP-5690 is a brothel located in the city of Las Vegas. SCP-5690 is staffed almost entirely by Ardor-class demonic entities, characterized by a specialty toward the third Cardinal Vice, lust. SCP-5690 currently employs 16 Ardor-class entities. 

Customers, generally unaware of the anomalous nature of the business, provide payment in exchange for the entities performing sexual acts on them. The entities&#39; benefit from this is twofold; in addition to payment to sustain the business, Ardor-class demons are sustained by the Tartarean Resonance Energy produced when they engage in intercourse with a mortal. 

SCP-5690 was accidentally discovered in March of 1993 by Agent Clark Adams, who was part of the initial wave of personnel transferred to the newly-constructed Site-666.

SCP-5690-B is the owner and proprietor of SCP-5690. [!-- &#34;Xōchiquetzal&#34; --]

**INTERVIEWER:** Agent Alice Sterling

**SUBJECT:** Agent Clark Adams

= **&lt;&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;&gt;**
----

**STERLING:** What the fuck, Clark.

**ADAMS:** No, look, I can explain-

**STERLING:** What were you doing in a brothel?

**ADAMS:** I mean, there&#39;s only like two things to do in a brothel.

**STERLING:** And both are illegal! I don&#39;t care what you do on your leisure time, but like-

**ADAMS:** Look, can we focus on the anomaly?

//[STERLING sighs.]//

**STERLING:** Yes, alright. Let&#39;s hear it, from the start.

**ADAMS:** Well, I&#39;d just finished following up on a couple of reports, you know how it is, and I decided to explore the city, get a feel for the place. A couple of the boys, not naming names, had mentioned this one place to me, real fancy, high-class place where you could find a, uh, companion, for the night. So that night I was feeling particularly frisky. You know what they say, the hog wants what it wants.

**STERLING:** Is this really necessary?

**ADAMS:** I&#39;m just trying to give you a feel for the story, boss. So anyway, I goes to the place, [!-- this is not a typo --] right, and it&#39;s this dinky little hole-in-the-wall building, and that&#39;s when I noticed the red lights inside the glass and I think to myself, //those motherfuckers sent me to a brothel.// They really put one over on me, and I had half a mind to go back and give &#39;em a piece of my mind, sending me off to an illegal esta-

**STERLING:** You already told me that you knew it was a brothel, Clark.

**ADAMS:** ... Right, yes, I did.

**STERLING:** Just get on with it.

**ADAMS:** Well, I went inside, and then I noticed the little doohickey //[ADAMS points to the TRE Counter on the table]// started beeping its little head off. I&#39;d forgotten to take it out of my bag after my shift, and now it was ruining my evening. 

**STERLING:** Then I assume you left the premises and alerted base.

**ADAMS:** Er, no. Well, I-I thought about doing that, but figured it&#39;d look real bad if it was a false alarm or something, and I was already there anyway, I might as well investigate some by myself before calling in the cavalry.

**STERLING:** Uh huh.

**ADAMS:** So anyway, the lady at the little desk at the lobby asked me whether I was looking for some fun for the night. I says yes, and she tells me their prices. I paid up, can&#39;t put a price on containment-

**STERLING:** With your own money?

**ADAMS:** Of course.

**STERLING:** Then why was there a withdrawal last night of $70 in your name?

**ADAMS:** Uh, gas money? Anyway, I got sent on up the stairs to one of the rooms. I went in, real tasteful place, well-decorated, and flopped out down on the bed. To set up an ambush.

**STERLING:** Naked, according to your report.

**ADAMS:** Yes, boss. When in Rome...

//[STERLING shakes her head before motioning for him to continue.]//

**ADAMS:** Well, a couple minutes later, this woman opens the door and comes through. Nice-looking girl, dressed in some fine evening-wear. I was real distracted, which is why I didn&#39;t notice the horns until we were on the bed.

**STERLING:** Good god.

**ADAMS:** Look, boss, I paid out my nose for that, I&#39;m gonna get my money&#39;s worth. And good GOLLY, was it worth the money. I tell you, that was, by far, the most-

**STERLING:** I really don&#39;t need to hear this, Clark.

**ADAMS:** Right, yes. Well, when we were done, I figured between the sensor going ape and the horns on the gal, I had found me a demon hotspot. 

**STERLING:** So that&#39;s when you headed back to base to report it. We&#39;ll send in a team to st-

**ADAMS:** Er, no. That was when I went back in for round two.

**SUBJECT:** SCP-5690-B

= **&lt;&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;&gt;**
----

**ADAMS:** Hello, ma&#39;am.

**SCP-5690-B:** Please leave.

**STERLING:** We just have a few questions, miss. We&#39;re from the precin-

**SCP-5690-B:** How dumb do I look? You&#39;re Foundation, you have the goddamn logo on your patch.

//[ADAMS adjusts his patch, coughing.]//

**STERLING:** ... Right, yes, of course. You&#39;re familiar with us?

**SCP-5690-B:** Everyone of note in Undervegas knows who you are. You can&#39;t really topple a demon kingpin without making waves, love.
 
**STERLING:** Well then, would you mind answering some of our questions?

**SCP-5690-B:** Yes.

**STERLING:** Why&#39;s that?

**SCP-5690-B:** I don&#39;t work for free, darling.

//[SCP-5690-B hands a small flyer to STERLING.]//

**STERLING:** ... Seriously?

**SCP-5690-B:** A girl&#39;s gotta work.

**STERLING:** $70 for an hour? I don&#39;t - is that cheap?

**ADAMS:** Oh, yeah boss, that&#39;s a whole deal and a half. Generous discount. A real bargai-

**STERLING:** How many brothels do you //go to?//

**SCP-5690-B:** Look, are you paying or not?

**ADAMS:** Don&#39;t worry boss, I got this. //[To SCP-5690-B]// I&#39;ll give you $35 for a half hour.

**SCP-5690-B:** Huh, you weren&#39;t that quick last time.

**ADAMS:** It&#39;s only a few questions, we promise.

**SCP-5690-B:** Are you neg- you know what, I&#39;ll take it.

**ADAMS:** Great. //[To STERLING]// Alright boss, you owe the lady thirty-five.

**STERLING:** I thought you said you got it!

**ADAMS:** Do I look like the kind of lowlife who pays for sex?

**STERLING:** //[Sighs]// You-  Yeah, alright, here.

**SCP-5690-B:** Thank //you.// And the clock is running.

**STERLING:** Okay. How long has this place been open?

**SCP-5690-B:** Oh, a couple years now. It&#39;s slow growth in this business, but steady, especially in the locale. Started with only me and two other girls, now we&#39;re up to sixteen.

**STERLING:** Does anyone know about your anomalous nature?

**SCP-5690-B:** Not... really. People know us as the place that&#39;s safe, not obscenely expensive, and most importantly, a //really// good lay.

**STERLING:** Anomalously good?

**SCP-5690-B:** //[Muttered.]// They don&#39;t call me a semen demon for nothing...

**STERLING:** What?

**SCP-5690-B:** What?

**ADAMS:** Do people actually call you that?

**SCP-5690-B:** ... Sometimes. 

**STERLING:** Moving on... what&#39;s your benefit from this arrangement?

**SCP-5690-B:** What do you mean? 

**STERLING:** Couldn&#39;t you return to Hell? No having to worry about cops, and all the demon fucking you could want?

**SCP-5690-B:** No can do. We&#39;re of a specific breed of demon - we get full from the energy released between demons and mortals. Has to be both. We&#39;re the demons, and the mortals pay to come to us. We get the money and the sustenance. It&#39;s pretty efficient.

**STERLING:** Fair enough.

**SCP-5690-B:** It also lets me help the local girls.

**STERLING:** How&#39;s that?

**SCP-5690-B:** What, did you think I was importing girls from Hell to work for me? No, fuck no. Some of the girls here got pulled over during the city shifting to Hell and back - thanks for getting rid of those, by the by - and got no way to get back. They&#39;d starve without this place, or be reduced to working the corners. Like I used to.

**STERLING:** So you give them a home in exchange for... I see. Very benevolent.

**SCP-5690-B:** Yeah, well, girls gotta stick together.

//[Silence.]//

**STERLING:** We may have overpaid for time.

**SCP-5690-B:** No kidding. You&#39;ve still get about twenty left on the clock. 

**STERLING:** Can I get a refund?

**SCP-5690-B:** ... No.

**ADAMS:** Well, if we&#39;ve still got time paid for, it&#39;d be a waste if you, y&#39;know...

**STERLING:** Jesus Christ, Clark.

**SCP-5690-B:** //[Muttered.]// Not that asshole. //[To ADAMS]// Well, I&#39;m obviously down if you are.

**STERLING:** Amazing. I&#39;ll be in the car. 

//[SCP-5690-B grasps ADAMS&#39; hand and begins leading him toward the stairs.]//

**STERLING:** Wait, hold on.

**SCP-5690-B:** Yeah?

**STERLING:** Earlier you said &#39;specific breed of demon&#39; -- you&#39;re succubi, aren&#39;t you?

**SCP-5690-B:** //[Laughing]// Yeah, no, honey. Everyone thinks we are, but no.

**STERLING:** What are you, then?

**SCP-5690-B:** We&#39;re incubi.

**STERLING:** Aren&#39;t all incubi male?

**SCP-5690-B:** You&#39;d think that. The only difference between a succubus and incubus is whether they&#39;re a bottom or a top.

**STERLING:** Oh. Well, have fun, you two.

//[ADAMS&#39; smile falters.]//

**SCP-5690-B:** Oh, we will.
