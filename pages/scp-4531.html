**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4531 is to be monitored by Mobile Task Force Eta-77 (&#34;Spheres Within Spheres&#34;)[[footnote]]Mobile Task Force Unit η-77 is the designation for The Department of Tactical Theology&#39;s personalized operational unit, consisting of fifteen specialized members. All personnel in the task force have expertise in dealing with aggressive or threatening religion-related anomalies.[[/footnote]] for potentially disruptive anomalous activity during the months of September and October. During a //Tashlich// Event, MTF Eta-77 is to be positioned upstream of the Daugava river to observe it; should an instance of SCP-4531-1 taller than fifty meters manifest, MTF Eta-77 is to terminate the instance via any means available.

In the event MTF Eta-77 fails to report back within thirty minutes of the event&#39;s conclusion, or the response is unintelligible, a drone is to be sent out in order to determine the status of the Task Force. Should MTF Eta-77 be rendered heavily incapacitated, and therefore incapable of destroying an SCP-4531-1 instance, Mobile Task Force Nu-7 (&#34;Hammer Down&#34;) is to be brought to SCP-4531 and destroy the anomaly.

SCP-4531-2 is available to Level 3 or higher personnel working with hazardous, mind-affecting anomalies, by the discretion of their HMCL. Personnel are not to consume or inject higher than the recommended dosage of SCP-4531-2. More information on SCP-4531-2 usage can be found in the Usage of Chemicals and Materials Guideline (UCMG).

**Description:** SCP-4531 is the designation for the town of Pļaviņas, Latvia, located along the Daugava river. SCP-4531&#39;s local population is primarily Jewish by both ethnicity and religion — approximately 92% of the town is ethnically Jewish, while 64% are observant in some capacity. All ethnically Jewish individuals within SCP-4531&#39;s borders experience its primary anomalous effect, regardless if they are permanently residing within SCP-4531 or visiting.

Annually on the first of //Tishrei//[[footnote]]The first month of the Jewish Lunar Calendar. Typically coincides with September or October.[[/footnote]] at sundown, the residents of SCP-4531 congregate at the Daugava river for a religious ceremony known as //Tashlich//. During this, an individualized prayer service is performed, and is concluded by the shaking of each person&#39;s garments. This process will result in the manifestation of SCP-4531-1.

SCP-4531-1 is the collective designation for a group of incorporeal organisms. SCP-4531-1 vary in physiology depending on specific factors of the individual which created them, most notably the amount and type of negative actions partaken in the prior lunar year, as according to the Torah&#39;s definition. Common features of SCP-4531-1 instances include red coloration, multiple skewed limbs, and disproportionately long torsos. SCP-4531-1 instances will remain immobile (unless provoked) for ten days, and if not destroyed by then, will become unconditionally hostile.

On the tenth day of //Tishrei//, which corresponds with the Jewish holiday of //Yom Kippur//, the residents of SCP-4531 will engage in a fast while congregating at a place of worship (typically a synagogue) for lengthy prayer services. Once an individual has completed the prayer service and fasted according to proper customs, the SCP-4531-1 instance corresponding to them will spontaneously combust, producing SCP-4531-2.

SCP-4531-2 is a fluid produced solely by the combustion of SCP-4531-1 on //Yom Kippur//. Upon oral ingestion, SCP-4531-2 causes numerous psychological and physiological changes in subjects, including:

* Increased cognitive resistance to harmful memes.
* Increased physical endurance.
* Increased efficiency at problem solving and creative thinking.
* Increased immune system effectiveness.
* Increased mental health and well-being.

The exact methods through which SCP-4531-2 achieves this effect is unclear, as no attempts to record chemical interactions between the substance and areas affected have been successful. In addition, the chemical make-up of SCP-4531-2 appears to be nonsensical, and no ways of achieving its molecular structure have been successfully tested.

For more information on SCP-4531-2, please consult your local HMCL or the UCMG.

SCP-4531-2 was utilized by the residents of SCP-4531 until Foundation interception in 1999, when SCP-4531-1 was discovered and contained. Following this, **{{[RESTRICTED TO PERSONNEL ASSIGNED TO PROJECT TOCHACHA]}}**.
