**SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:** SCP-7134 is uncontained and 7134-Events are recurring. [[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]Termination of SCP-7134 (Project Foxgloves) has been authorized with issuing of Termination Order A7134.[[/span]] As of [[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]7/31/2022, one hundred and five (105)[[/span]] personnel are in long-term assignment to SCP-7134 operations, lead by Head Researcher Dr. Yago Morro, PhD[[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]],[[/span]] Head Tactician Captain Jackson Baxters[[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]], and Reader7134.aic (all[[/span]] Lv. 4 Clearance). [[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]Assignment of [[[SCP-181]]] to [[[task-forces#alpha-9|Mobile Task Force Alpha-9 &#34;Last Hope&#34;]]] for training as a specialized 7134-Event response agent is under consideration.[[/span]]

Mobile Task Force Sampson-7 &#34;Bugsy&#39;s Bunny&#34; has been organized for the securement of 7134-Events. Intercepted communications, surveillances, or other media pertaining to SCP-7134 and 7134-Events are to be followed up on by MTF Sampson-7 to conduct the securement of the 7134-Event, and the demanifestation or termination of SCP-7134. Attempts to contain extant SCP-7134 are not to be made unless approved prior to mission by [[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]both Head Researcher and Head Tactician OR by an Overseer.[[/span]] Miscellaneous reports of anomalous rabbits forwarded by field agents and web crawlers (per standard cryptid investigation protocols) are under further review to determine undocumented 7134-Events requiring securing.

[[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]Reader7134.aic has been devised for the attendance of the WGCP System; referral of RAISA inventory on SCP-7134 and related; and distribution of information between personnel on 7134-Event assignments.[[/span]] The Weather-Gamble Cross-Positioning (WGCP) System is in operation for the designed purpose of locating meteorological activity in relation to gambling establishments within the continental United States of America, and for cataloging viable locations for 7134-Events. In the field tracking of SCP-7134, personnel are advised to use [[[and-this-one-explains-humes|Kant counters]]] to assist in locating extant specimens. [[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]Additionally, Kant-Sueyro sensors are being installed into ATMs across the United States by [[[task-forces#mu-4|Mobile Task Force Mu-4 &#34;Debuggers&#34;]]]; over 3,500 Kant-Sueyro sensors are online and surveyed by WGCP as of writing.[[/span]]

All SCP-7134 in containment are deceased. Eighty (80) cadavers are in cryogenic storage at: Site-19; [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-43|Site-43]]]; Site-66; [[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]][[[secure-facility-dossier-site-300|Site-300-14]]].

Use as a visual aid for awareness of personnel is encouraged. Twenty-one (21) taxidermies are under construction for use in thaumaturgic experiments.[[/span]][!--[[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]fcukign bnuuy--][[/span]] [[/footnote]] Additional cadavers are to be to transferred to Site-300-14 for purposing in Project Foxgloves.[[/span]]

**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-7134 is a mammalian species of leporine morphology with cervine traits (//Lepus antilocapra//), analogous to the &#34;jackalope&#34; of North American folklore. Aside from the chimeric nature of the species, specimens have exhibited unexplained abilities including: intangibility; cognitohazardous compulsion; sentience; sapience; capability of speech for the utilization of language; low-end reality-bending; probability-alteration or short-term clairvoyance, and preservation of a single identity through reincarnation or gestalt consciousness. 

Sightings of SCP-7134, designated 7134-Events, are scarce yet regularly occurring under predictable circumstances. Observation of over eight hundred (&gt;800) confirmed 7134-Events has identified three universal constants, as the phenomenon occurs exclusively:
* within the continental United States of America,
* within the property lines of establishments host to gambling[[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]...[[/span]]
 * [[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]...IF the property is within a thirty-five-mile-radius (//r// = 35 mi.) from landfall of a lightning strike produced within the preceding lunar month.[[/span]]
* on the night of a full moon.
[[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]The concentration of lightning strikes in an area is unrelated to the probability of an event occurring.[[/span]] While manifestation of an SCP-7134 instance has not been directly observed, specimens have always been in the vicinity of at least one (1) conscious person for a 7134-Event.

Adult SCP-7134&#39;s physiology is standard for that of female specimens found in the genus //Lepus//,[[footnote]] Shared genus of hares and jackrabbits. C. Linnaeus, 1758. [[/footnote]] in exception to the presence of two (2) horns emerging from the head, ranging 12.2-18.5 cm (4.8-7.4 in.) in length.[[footnote]] With exception to Taxidermy №4. How this specimen&#39;s antlers grew to such length is unknown. [[/footnote]] Aside from this chimeric appearance, the external anatomy is entirely non-anomalous. Autopsies have found that the internal anatomy (especially the nervous, respiratory, reproductive systems) does not have any physical abnormalities that can be attributed as cause for SCP-7134&#39;s anomalous properties. 

Genetic analysis of SCP-7134 has produced mixed results. Analysis of soft tissue and bodily fluids indicates the species is closely related to //Lepus alleni//.[[footnote]] Antelope jackrabbit. E.A. Mearns, 1890 [[/footnote]] Analysis of hard tissue (horns and other) is identified as near identical to that of //Antilocapra americana//.[[footnote]] Pronghorn, or American antelope. G. Ord, 1815 [[/footnote]] Aside from horns, bone structure is as expected of leporids. How SCP-7134 persists despite the incompatibility of these biologies is unknown. All inspected instanced have invariably been female, and the mitochondrial DNA is completely identical in said instances. Expression of phenotypes vary between instances, as they may range in weight; size; coat color; coat pattern; horn length; and other minutiae. It is also noted that SCP-7134 is genetically distinct from [[[SCP-6968]]]-2-C, and no instances have been found to be diseased by //Kappapapillomavirus 2//[[footnote]] Shope papilloma virus (SPV), or cottontail rabbit papilloma virus (CRPV): papillomavirus that develops keratinous carcinomas in leporids; hypothesized non-anomalous origin for jackrabbit myth. Shope, 1933. [[/footnote]] or similar.

Reproduction, development, and maturation of SCP-7134 is unverified. Due to similar biology compared to //Lepus alleni//, SCP-7134 is projected to have a gestation cycle of approximately six weeks, and conception requires a compatible male specimen of identical or related species. Alternate hypotheses of parthenogenesis and/or tachygestation are also considered. Formation of the skeleton indicates that bone development occurs at rates expected for //Lepus alleni//, and encountered adults are two years (2 yrs.) of age on average. SCP-7134 are noted to be highly physically active despite pregnancy, and have not exhibited notable hindrances in mobility either before or after giving birth.

SCP-7134 can produce litters of up to seven (7) leverets, averaging at four (4). Stillbirths have not been observed. Leverets exhibit several physiological properties not seen in adults, nor any non-anomalous fauna. SCP-7134 brood have been impermeable to matter in all observed cases, and any attempts to restrict with them have produced no results. Leverets appear translucent blue when viewed directly, and can only be detected by energy-based imaging systems. Despite no recognizable source for photon emission, leverets are moderately luminescent and vary in brightness ≈30-80 candelas. 

While most lagomorphs are altricial and nidicolous, SCP-7134 inversely is highly precocial and nidifugous, more so than any other //Lepus// species. Newborn SCP-7134 are appear far more physical developed than other newborn leporids, possessing an apparent morphology analogous of a non-anomalous //Lepus alleni// leverets two weeks (2 wks.) in age, only with addition of velveted antlers ≈1 cm (0.4 in.) in length. These broods are capable of locomotion upon birth, and if provided nesting, will leave the nest within hours. Strangely, SCP-7134 leverets experience half of what gravitational acceleration would be expected of an organism of their size (g = 4.13 m/s²), and can retain traction in air, directing themselves as done for terrestrial locomotion.

For their incorporeal nature, newborn SCP-7134 specimens are classified as Class-II Apparitions.[[footnote]] An incorporeal apparition that can be directly perceived in baseline reality (contrast [[[SCP-4175|Class-I]]]), but whose interaction with reality cannot impact matter unilaterally ([[[SCP-4435|Class-III]]]), entirely (Class-IV), or selectively ([[[SCP-1337|Class-V]]]) post manifestation. [[/footnote]] Adult specimens are currently classified as Class-IV, with potential to be reclassified as Class-V. Adult SCP-7134 have an above average Hume reading of ≈146 Hm, and newborn SCP-7134 commonly have a below average Hume reading of ≈87 Hm, which may rise to average or above average levels following the death of their mother.

[[collapsible show=&#34;🟢 SCP-7134 Ethology/Psychology 🟢&#34; hide=&#34;Chapter accessed&#34; hideLocation=&#34;both&#34;]]

[[div style=&#34;background: white; padding: 10px;&#34;]]
Ethology of SCP-7134 has not been observed outside of 7134-Events. Limited interactions between SCP-7134 and their brood have been observed, but an affinity to socialize with humans is prominent.   As instances perform socialization with awareness of themselves and others; discerning of their actions; absence of individuality; recollection of experiences and information exclusive to previous instances, SCP-7134 definitively possesses sapience in the form of either a gestalt entity or a reincarnating consciousness. As a species with a single known consciousness, critical threat should be exposed to an infohazard. Application of lethal cognitohazards have shown to only effect an individual.

SCP-7134 are capable of human speech despite the absence of necessitated anatomy. Adult instances have been observed to speak with fluency in English, Spanish, French, Ojibwe, and Mandarin, with limited to inexistent comprehension of other languages. Conversations with instances have shown SCP-7134 capable perceiving and replicating tones and vocalics used in speech for appropriate meta-communication; non-anomalous leporid vocalics; laughter; and on select occasions, singing. Voices of SCP-7134 are commonly described as feminine, but accents vary between instances and are often endemic (if not, prevalent) to the area the instances are encountered in.

The SCP-7134 consciousness is acutely aware of their perpetuating nature. SCP-7134 recognizes herself as a singular identity inhabiting several organisms that lack intellectual autonomy between members of their species. There is plausibility that SCP-7134 is in actuality reincarnating within her own lineage and is under the erroneous belief she is a gestalt. When speaking with humans, SCP-7134 uses grammatical person to reflect the physical individually of SCP-7134 specimens, active instances refer to their being in the first-person with present tense, referring to past or future instances in first- or third-person with appropriate tenses, and clarifying familial relation between does and leverets. Per comments from instances, SCP-7134&#39;s gender identity is currently accepted as female. If SCP-7134 is a gestalt entity, it is uncertain if the gestalt identifies the entirety of itself as female, or just all encountered instances as they are biologically female. 

Adult SCP-7134&#39;s behavior is highly Machiavellian, as instances conduct themselves differently depending on the human social environment. Psychoanalysis of SCP-7134&#39;s personality has found her exemplative of psychopathy, with a grading of 35/40 in accordance to the Psychopathy Checklist—revised (PCL-R). 
* Regarding the &#34;boldness&#34; trait, SCP-7134 possesses a high tolerance for stress and fear, and is regularly assertive and confident in her actions. She has little regard for danger and unfamiliarity due to effective immortality, acting without reservation sometimes to the point of being suicidal. SCP-7134 appears to only practice self-preservation for sake of personal experience, and can show apathy or lack of urgency towards raising their brood. 
* Regarding the &#34;disinhibition&#34; trait, SCP-7134 has considerable but finite restraint. Whether the circumstances of a 7134-Event are arranged through planning and foresight on her part or anomalously fabricated, SCP-7134 regardless can restrain herself to a certain set of behaviors for hours in the presence of others. If SCP-7134 reaches a point where she does not see necessity for patience, she will begin to act highly impulsive.
* Regarding the &#34;meanness&#34; trait, SCP-7134 greatly lacks empathy towards others, regularly hiding this from people unacquainted with her. She exercises exploitative tendencies to facilitate acts of cruelty, as she finds amusement from witnessing or inflicting misfortune upon a person. If SCP-7134 interacts with a person not considered susceptible to exploitation, she will verbally harass in order to distract or irritate. [[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]Most disturbingly, SCP-7134 is willing to jeopardize millions of lives and concurrent K-Class Scenarios for her amusement.[[/span]]
SCP-7134 is also noted to have an affinity to humor (especially what is morbid or sadistic in nature) and will perform displays for the allurement of targets, distraction or irritation of opponents, or for generalized self-amusement.

SCP-7134 also exhibits behaviors seen in other lagomorphs. The species&#39; body language is mostly comprised of kinesics seen in //Oryctolagus cuniculus domesticus//,[[footnote]] Domesticated rabbit. C. Linnaeus, 1758. [[/footnote]] but instances have been observed positioning their heads in ways akin to humans mannerisms, including to maintain eye contact. SCP-7134 may redirect themselves to gather sustenance if a location provides food or is decorated with plants considered favorable. Aside from what is ordinarily consumable, some SCP-7134 have consumed food or materials that are inedible or toxic for hares, either through accident or intentionally. While SCP-7134 anatomy indicates the species involuntarily defecates, arguments have been made that SCP-7134 exhibits voluntary control.

SCP-7134 exhibits nesting behavior largely similar to other lagomorphs, only instead of settling in low sheltered aboveground locations like other hares, SCP-7134 incentivizes locations that are difficult or rarely to be accessed by humans and often indoors. Nests constructed by SCP-7134 can be composed from materials commonly used by nesting does (grass, twigs, flower stems, fur from does&#39; dewlap), but often include or are mainly comprised from unorthodox materials sourced through theft, battery, or destruction of property (paper currency, physicals documents, clothing, metal wiring, plastic tubing, rope fibers, flower petals, hair from other organisms).

[[collapsible show=&#34;🟢 7134-Event Occurrence 🟢&#34; hide=&#34;Chapter accessed&#34; hideLocation=&#34;both&#34;]]

[[div style=&#34;border:1px solid black&#34;]]
[[div style=&#34;background: white; padding: 10px;&#34;]]
Since cataloging of 7134-Events was initiated, [[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]742 of 952[[/span]] projected events have been identified by the SCP Foundation. At least twenty (20) additional events have or are likely to have occurred prior to 1945. Liberal estimates state approximately 2,400 (cir. 1829) to 3,000 (cir. 1776) 7134-Events could have possibly occurred.

Frequency of 7134-Events is highly regular, occurring every 684±8 hours, or approximately every twenty-nine days (29 dy). The phenomenon is in a rough synchronization with the lunar month, always occurring on the date of a full moon, but not in an exact correlation to the moon&#39;s synodic period. Events can occur at any point in the day, most commonly during nocturnal hours. Due to the region in which SCP-7134 is endemic to spanning across four times zones, there is a contiguous twenty-seven hour period (27:00) in which an 7134-Event can initiate and terminate in.

Localization of 7134-Events is unnaturally confined, occurring only within the continental United States of America. Apparent distribution of SCP-7134 appears to be restricted not only by geographic borders, but also by legislative borders as defined by the federal and state governments. At no point has an extant SCP-7134 specimen been observed to emigrate over national land or ocean borders, but remains can be relocated out of country. SCP-7134 has not been observed in Alaska; Hawai&#39;i; or any U.S. Territories, alive or dead. Due to varying state legislations, prevalence of 7134-Events most concentrated in states with unrestrictive gambling laws, but may still occur in states where gambling is highly regulated or outright illegal.[[footnote]] Most notably Utah, where gambling is prohibited under religious cause by the predominantly Latter Day Saint population. 7134-Events in Utah have uncovered the existence of twenty-five (25) illegally operated cardrooms. [[/footnote]]

7134-Events exclusively occur at geographic locations that have had property lines determined by land surveyors, and are actively serving (at least in part) as a forum for humans to partake in gambling. Whether the gambling house is publicly listed or unlisted; legally or illegally operated is inconsequential. These locations may be coextensive with hotels, resorts, racetracks, parks, country clubs[[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]], and SCP Foundation facilities.[[/span]] SCP-7134 are always first encountered within the property lines of the target location, where SCP-7134 will occupy for the duration of the event. SCP-7134 can leave properties of their own volition, although this will regularly result in the termination of 7134-Events.

A correlation between local meteorological activity has been observed in most instances; over four hundred (&gt;400) 7134-Events from 1972-2022 have been positively identified to have occurred at locations within a [[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]thirty-five[[/span]]-mile-radius (//r// = [[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]35[[/span]] mi.) from landfall of a lightning strike produced within the preceding [[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]lunar month. A previous understanding that the concentration of lightning strikes in an area correlated to the probability of an 7134-Event occurring has since been ruled as inaccurate measure. An 7134-Event can be preceded by a single light strike within a previously underestimated timeframe.[[/span]]

While the exact measures of a 7134-Event is highly unpredictable, 7134-Events follow a general series of phases with a primary point of deviation and a latent termination procedure that may initiate at any point during the event. This rough chronology is as follows:
* 0. -- The location of an 7134-Event will experience a substantial decrease in local Hume levels. -- Hume levels can decline by up to 30 Hm. A Hume fluctuation can only be marked as the initiation of a 7134-Event upon confirmation of SCP-7134&#39;s presence.
* 1. -- An adult SCP-7134 pregnant with a litter will manifest within the property unobserved. -- Manifestation of an SCP-7134 instance has never been directly observed. Absences in video evidence substantiates that SCP-7134 arrives at a location through anomalous means. 
* 2. -- SCP-7134 will target a person or persons to interact with. -- SCP-7134 will prioritize those who are either impaired; impulsive; or easily manipulated in some form. Subject most often targets an isolated person, [[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]but can target a massive organization;[[/span]] and has not been observed to to approach a party greater than [[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]seven (7)[[/span]] people. [[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]Subject may fabricate an elaborate high-risk scenario specialized for targets before initiating approach.[[/span]]
 * //IF Phase 2 is conducted in full://
  * 3a. -- SCP-7134 will approach the target(s) and converse. -- SCP-7134 will conduct highly approachable behavior, often issuing complements or expressing humor. SCP-7134 will soon extend offers of companionship or advice.
  * 4a. -- SCP-7134 will accompany the target(s) for activities involving risk taking to some degree. -- Activities entail that the participants provided opportunity for profit either monetarily, socially, or emotionally. On occasions, SCP-7134 has fabricated scenarios for such risk taking.
  * 5a -- Target(s) will experience success in activities for a prolonged period of time. -- Targets usually benefit by following advice provided to them by SCP-7134, and progressively increase wagers. Local Hume levels will gradually rise over time, indicative of decreases in probability alteration.
  * 6a. -- SCP-7134 will depart following or in anticipation of sudden substantial loss to at least one (1) person involved, most often the target(s). -- Outcome may result in loss of wealth; social relations; employment; autonomy; or life. Those involved may be negatively impacted by the events of 7134-Events after a prolonged period of time, as much as years after incident.
 * //IF Phase 2 is interfered with://
  * 3b. -- SCP-7134 will [[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]confront or[[/span]] be intercepted by an opposing party knowledgeable of it&#39;s activity/cognizant of it&#39;s anomalous nature. -- In all relevant cases, this has been the SCP Foundation[[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]], the Nevada Gaming Commission, and [[/span]]amateur paranormal enthusiasts. It is unknown [[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]what[[/span]] other paranormal organizations have responded to 7134-Events.
  * 4b. -- SCP-7134 will react to confrontation to some degree. -- SCP-7134 will conduct antagonistic behavior, often issuing taunts or testing patience. SCP-7134 will soon attempt to relocate herself from confronter(s).
  * 5b -- SCP-7134 will either have visual on it lost or sustain fatal injury. -- Attempts to pursue SCP-7134 may result in traversal of environmental hazards; destruction of property; loss of life[[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]; substantial threat to normalcy[[/span]].
* 7a/6b. 7134-Event will terminate following the complete departure or neutralization of SCP-7134 instances, signified by restoration of Hume levels to baseline.

SCP-7134 will give birth to her litter at some point during the 7134-Event, either while extant or upon death. In some cases, SCP-7134 will attempt to find a location to create a nest to birth and house the litters for the remainder of event. In a completed nest, the SCP-7134 mother will give natural birth to the litter, which will remain in the nest until the mother either initiates the brood to evacuate the nest, leaves the property, or is terminated. If SCP-7134 is terminated before giving birth, the litter will be experience post-mortem birth by permeating outside of SCP-7134&#39;s womb. SCP-7134 brood will run in different directions.

Operating with a local/personal Hume reading of ≈87/146, the adult SCP-7134 specimens qualify as a Class-I Reality Bender. SCP-7134&#39;s reality warping capabilities appears to primarily manifests as probability alteration, as SCP-7134 and those around her regularly experience convoluted or unrealistic circumstances that would otherwise be low-probability in baseline reality. These probability alteration are commonly prefaced by a declarative statement whose subject is ironic or predictive for the succeeding effects. SCP-7134&#39;s utilization of such statements is currently hypothesized to serve the purpose of an ontokinetic aid or [[[i-h-p-proposal|similar device]]]. There is no substantial evidence that SCP-7134 has manifested other more commonly exhibited Class-I reality warping capabilities such as ectoentropic or atomic manipulation.

Despite the readily apparent anomalous nature of the species, viewers of adult SCP-7134 do not commonly take issue with the presence as would be expected. This is attributed to the emission of a pretermemetic cognitohazard; as no physical evidence for a source can be identified in SCP-7134&#39;s anatomy, this is a secondary manifestation of SCP-7134&#39;s reality warping capabilities. Viewers with a score of 7.4 or higher on the Cognitive Resistance Scale or with prior knowledge of SCP-7134 and 7134-Events will be able to accurately perceive the abnormality of the phenomena. Viewers who are ignorant or borderline knowledgeable about jackalope folklore will recognize SCP-7134 as a jackalope (or &#34;horned rabbit&#34; or &#34;antelabbit&#34;), but will remain (to varying extent depending on CRS score) significantly oblivious to how their encounter contradicts the apparent fictionality of cryptids as understood by the public. The pretermemetic effects will terminate completely upon neutralization of the adult SCP-7134 instance and its reality bending. SCP-7134 leverets do not exhibit the pretermemetic cognitohazard, as sightings will cause panic among civilians. There is evidence that SCP-7134 instances may exhibit probability alteration succeeding the termination of their mother.

**HISTORY:** The earliest written record of a horned jackrabbit or similar cryptid in North America can be dated back to 1829, with the reported capture by a trapper named Roy Ball. It is unknown if this and many subsequent records of jackalope sightings were valid, as following the taxidermy of a &#34;jackalope&#34; by brothers Douglas and Ralph Herrick in 1934,[[footnote]] Confirmed a forgery in 1937 by [[[SCP-2750|American Secure Containment Initiative]]]. [[/footnote]] the creature has become commonplace in American pop culture and art forgery. The oldest verified instance of SCP-7134 is a taxidermy mount dated to the 1870s (pictured), recovered from [[[SCP-1867|a cottage in Westminster]]] in 2012. The extent of SCP-7134&#39;s relevancy with the whole of jackrabbits or similar folklore predating 1829 is unknown. [[size smaller]]__//Request the Department of Mythology and Folkloristics for access to further reading on: jackalopes; North American cryptids; Anishinaabe traditional beliefs.//__[[/size]]

The SCP Foundation&#39;s earliest record of an SCP-7134 instance dates back to 1938, describing the recovery of a full-body taxidermy of a leporine species with horns found in the possession of an American associate of Marshall, Carter, &amp; Dark Ltd. Surviving documentation indicates that the specimen was found and killed on the premise of an Atlantic City casino with known affiliations with MC&amp;D. The whereabouts of Anomalous Object #343-LMRFDD and further documentation have since been lost.

Foundation assets would not encounter an 7134-Event until July 25th, 1945. Field Agent Drew Lotts responded to the aftermath of a fire at a cardroom in Galveston, Texas. Lotts&#39; investigation into an anomalous origin for the fire procured an eyewitness account of 7134-Event-07251945 (formerly Incident-7134-B), and recovery of type specimen, SCP-7134-07251945. SCP-7134 was added to the registry of SCP objects on July 28th, 1945. Following 7134-Event-01071947 (formerly Incident-7134-G) and discovery of phenomenon&#39;s correlation with the lunar cycle, manifestations of SCP-7134 were redesignated as 7134-Events, suffixed by date of occurrence.[[footnote]] Month-day-year format is preserved for coherency across records. Conversion to alternative formats considered unnecessary due to localization of phenomena to United States. [[/footnote]] 

Miscellaneous field agents and task force members would be redirected for SCP-7134 securement efforts until in November of 1973, when Mobile Task Force Sampson-7 &#34;Bugsy&#39;s Bunny&#34; was organized for the specialized response to 7134-Events, and potential anomalies localized to gambling establishment. Across eight decades of containment efforts, [[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]thirteen (13)[[/span]] Foundation personnel have been killed in action, three (3) missing in action during 7134-Events.

Through observation and interactions with field agents, SCP-7134 has aggregated information to become knowledgeable of the SCP Foundation to a limited extent. SCP-7134 is currently believed to understand that the SCP Foundation:
* is a covert organization dealing with [[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]paranormal phenomena designated SCPs,[[/span]]
* considers SCP-7134 [[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]an SCP object,[[/span]]
* [[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]considers the Las Vegas-Paradise area an SCP location,[[/span]]
* is in active opposition of SCP-7134 activity [[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]] and other anomalous phenomena,[[/span]]
* has a presence in all forty-eight (48) states of the continental U.S,
* [[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]has a facility of operations coextensive with the Luxor Las Vegas,[[/span]]
* [[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]is responsible for prevention of apocalypse events,[[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]
* [[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]is in an agreement with the Nevada Gaming Commission,[[/span]]
* has at least [[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]seven (7)[[/span]] task forces that have been assigned to SCP-7134 at some point,
* has no current intent for capturing SCP-7134 alive.

[[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]SCP-7134 had not interfered with any anomalous phenomena outside of the measures of their Special Containment Procedures until July 13th, 2022, resulting in Incident-4661/7134-Luxor. 7134-Event-07132022 initiated at the Luxor Las Vegas hotel and casino in Paradise, Nevada, covertly operated as Site-666. The targeted actions of SCP-7134-07132022 during incident jeopardized the operation of Site-666, containment of SCP-4661, and maintenance of the Veil of Normalcy. Following termination of SCP-7134-07132022, Incident-4661/7134-Luxor was resolved without actualization of a Collapse Incident or Lifted Veil Scenario-4661.[[/span]]

[[span style=&#34;background-color: #BDEFBD; color: green;&#34;]]Due to the crises endured, on July 14th, 2022, Overseer Council ruled in favor of probable cause for terminating SCP-7134 (10-3-0). On July 15th, Project Foxgloves was enacted with the executive of total neutralization for 7134-Events and extinction of SCP-7134. Monitoring for SCP-7134 was provided additional expenses, including the specialized development of the Artificial Intelligence Construct Reader7134.aic by the AIAD Division. Reader7134.aic was brought online for assistant management of Project Foxgloves on July 20th.[[/span]]

**Summary:** In the afternoon of July 13th, 2000, an SCP phenomenon (7134-Event-07132022) occurred within the premises of Site-666&#39;s central facility (Luxor Hotel &amp; Casino), which met several criteria for event manifestation. The event subject (SCP-7134-07132022) conducted sabotage resulting of the House-Nicolas Theoplanar Vacuum Unit and related systems, the consecutive critical failures of which jeopardized the containment of SCP-4661 and inventory of Site-666 under threat of an Öß-Class &#34;Multi-Universal Amalgamation&#34; Scenario and subsequent LV-Class &#34;Lifted Veil&#34; Scenario.

While during construction Site-666 was recognized for viability of 7134-Event manifestation, redrawing of the properties lines was arranged so the administrative and mechanical levels (Basement Levels 1-2, Levels 31-35) exclusively owned by the SCP Foundation were legally separate from the remainder of facility lent out to MGM Resorts International. Site-666 had not been subject to a 7134-Event or other incident of critical threat to site operation at any point in the twenty-nine years (29 yrs.) of its operation, providing argument for complacency or unpreparedness of security.

Also noted that incident began while camera surveillance of Site-666 was left unattended, in violation of protocol. Scheduled surveillance officer was dismissed on medical leave, and intended replacement for the shift failed to have been notified of their sooner assignment.

Collapse Incident

to disengaged the defunct House-Nicolas Theoplanar Vacuum Unit (TVU(1)) from operating position and engage the back up (TVU(2)).

Due to the hostile environment of the operation, several SCP-4661-B were chosen for their heat resistance and compliance in order to perform where human technicians could not. In-room communication was conducted in absence of radio or video devices, with &#34;Antiel&#34; serving as a verbal relay between tech and admin.

Recorded from camera overlooking TVU chamber. Extraneous events not detailed.

[[div style=&#34;background: white; padding: 10px;&#34;]]
**Event:** Incident-4661/7134-Luxor
**Date:** July 13th, 2022 - July 15th, 2022
**Location:** USNVLV-Site-666 (Paradise, Nevada, United States)
**Assessor(s):** Dr. Juniper Perot, MTech
**Summary:** In Incident-4661/7134-Luxor, substantial damage was inflicted across nineteen (19) of the thirty-seven (37) levels of the Site-666 central complex, primarily in part due to consecutive critical failures of the House-Nicolas Theoplanar Vacuum Unit and related systems. Causation of incident was a crippling act of sabotage on behalf of SCP-7134 phenomena, with SCP-7134-07132022 exaggerating her standard behavior to an unprecedented scale.

[[div style=&#34;background: white; padding: 10px;&#34;]]
Basement Level 2a (BLv.2a) sustained moderate water damage succeeding the rupture of a pipe segment (1.52 m length; 254 mm diameter nominal) directed to Site-666 from Hoover Dam. Inspection of damage to pipe and surrounding indicated implosions were caused by pyrokinetic abilities of an SCP-4661-B instance. Ruptured intake main filled BLv.2a in surplus, extending to BLv.1 above. Subtracting the volume of equipment and infrastructure from the total volume of BLv.2a (12,397.98 m³ (4,132.66 m² × 3 m)), vacant space was occupied with approximately 12,000 m³ of holy water. Estimate of flooding onset placed at approximately 13:00 hours. Electrode ignition for water boilers short-circuited during flooding, requiring replacement of gas burners. BLv.2a was successfully drained during incident by Vegas-2 over a four-hour-period (4 hr.)

Inspection of facility found twelve (12) unfastened vent grates, eight (8) of which fared damage to the fasteners or the grates themselves due to forceful opening. Severance of a ventilation duct in maintenance closet on Level 26 was also found, along with the toppling of a storage shelf positioned underneath into the doorway, dislodging the door from the frame. Due to duress from thermal expansion (see below), the 7.77 m² × 2.75 m (25.5 sq ft. × 9 ft.) polarized glass pyramidion of the hotel facility shattered, requiring total replacement. Resulting debris caused twenty-three (23) bay windows to be broken open across Level 35 to 14, with an additional fifteen (15) requiring replacement due to extensive scratches. Pyrokinetic outbursts by SCP-4661-B instances incurred fire damage in five (5) hotels suites occupied by instances, as well as in the hotel laundry room. The replacement of Room 17026 front door and aforementioned windows are of greatest priority in room restoration efforts. An inspection of the fire detectors and sprinkler system in Basement Levels recommended.

Three (3) Scranton Reality Anchors have been damaged to varying extents. First and second SRAs require repairs for damages sustained to external apparatuses in falling deaths of Kappa-12 agents Deacon and Fife. Third damaged beyond repair in fall from Lv. 28 and has been slated for salvage. Level 1 sustained a gas leak, specifically within the Pyramid Café establishment. Damage was sustained to kitchen utilities in scuffle between SCP-7134 and Epsilon-11, where a loose gunshot breached a stove&#39;s gas line. Leak was ventilated out and repaired during incident by Vegas-2 within a three-hour-period (3 hr.)

The meat of our damages was the House-Nicholas Theoplanar Vacuum Units in our inventory.

The primary unit (henceforth TVU(1)), which has served without incident since its instillation in 1993, experienced a meltdown. Despite the failsafes instilled in the machine, they were not actualized at any point. The cause for this terminal error was that the wiring between the sensors and logic gates dedicated to TVU(1)&#39;s self-regulation was partially and precisely severed so that a connection was recognized by the recipient devices, but no feedback was sent to alert for changes in the readings. TVU(1) did not automatically deactivate when the supply of holy water to the reservoir was depleted; when the pylons&#39; internal sensors detected overheating; or when the power line was physically unplugged, as it instead continued to operate how it would in event of a power outage. The water meter, ammeter, thermometers, inlet nodes; all of it reported their readings to nothing. Fortunately the thermal sensors surveying the TVU chamber itself were left untampered and alerted us when it did, hours before we could have noticed otherwise. Manual deactivation of the TVU(1) was also unachievable, as the emergency power supply was severed from the control console, and the USB port for the killcode was partially blocked with rabbit feces. 

TVU(1) operated off of the now-isolated power supply with no moderation for its own failure, 
deteriorating from the heat accumulating in the Nicholas-Scranton Reality Anchor pylons[[footnote]] The Nicholas-Scranton Reality Anchor (NSRA) was developed in 19██ by Dr. Argent Nicholas, MPSc, off of prior work by Dr. Robert Scranton, MPSc. NSRAs are specialized for interaction with Tartarean Resonance Energy and modular assembly for construction into a pylon for efficacy of intake and storage. Eight (8) plyons are central components of the House-Nicholas TVU, drawing in TRE from the cardinal and ordinal directions. [[/footnote]] until the machine was rendered defunct. TVU(1) reached an internal temperature of 554.1℃ (1029.4℉) before system failure exceeded system function. Thermal expansion within the Planar Vacuum Unit culminated at 18:39 with the shattering of the pyramidion, sending 2,500 kg of polarized glass across the windowed exterior of the pyramid or into the frustum-shaped interior of the PVU. The opening of the PVU to the air following the destruction of the pyramidion did little to alleviate this overheating. It was also around this time that the lead lining of the coolant reservoir reached its melting point, leaking alpha radiation into the TVU chamber. The [[[SCP-3903|yttrium silver]]][[footnote]] Also known as mithril. A thaumaturgically conductive alloy that is an effective insulator of Tartarean Resonance Energy. [[/footnote]] lining of both the reservoir and the PVU externals remained intact, consequently insulating TRE inside the reservoir and maintaining internal temperature. 

The secondary unit (henceforth TVU(2)), initially presumed to be in an operable state, was found to have been sabotaged while in storage. All eight (8) of the TVU(2)&#39;s pylons were targeted. The wiring connecting the NSRAs to the power line, the emergency power supply, and to other NSRAs in their array were cut in over six hundred (600) locations, some having had portions excised. The tubing intended to draw the hydrogen-2 excess from the TVU(2) and the helium-4 product to the PVU&#39;s arc lamps was also found to have been severed. Most of these excised portions of wiring/tubing were found either littered in the basin of the TVU(2) reservoir and PVU. Debris found in the latter were fashioned into nesting further composed of SCP-7134 fur and confidential documents confirmed to have originated from the desks of Site-666 administration. During restoration efforts, negligible damage was inflicted to the PVU&#39;s planar array due to SCP-4661-B&#39;s traversal of the barrel during his observation of the SCP-7134 nest and brood. 

At some point between 19:04 and 21:14 during when the hydraulic lift was brought to floor level, the cables to the underside of the TVU were sabotaged while stored under the lift platform in the raised flooring. The cable protectors to the power supply cords and access cords was bitten through, from which the contents were accessed and severed indiscriminately. The tube for extraction of hydrogen-2 side product was also punctured. The replacements of these cables provided negligible delay in finalizing repair efforts.

Needless to say, the figures on the repair invoice is not going to be pretty.

[16:19] //V-2 Acosta and V-2 Zeigler remove outdoor maintenance covers. V-2 Zeigler faces remainder to team.//
**[16:19] - V-2 Zeigler:** Okay, straight and then right, and the east hallway will lead us to the flooding. David, we&#39;ll pull them in; you feed us slack.
**[16:19] - V-2 Acosta:** On it.
[16:19] //V-2 leaves towards drainage trucks. V-2 Zeigler picks up end of hose from ground.//
**[16:19] - V-2 Zeigler:** Nat, Ross, don&#39;t trip on each other.
[16:19] //V-2 Zeigler climbs down ladder, followed by V-2 La Paglia and V-2 Holub. Technicians walk down Access Hallway B1W2 to BLv.1 access door.//
**[16:20] - V-2 Zeigler:** Okay, where&#39;s the keys-- there.
[16:20] //V-2 Zeigler unlocks access door. RT V-2 enters central hallway and turn towards BLv.2a stairwell. BLv.2a is visibly flooded with water, beginning to overflow to BLv.1.//
**[16:20] - V-2 Holub:** It looks like a pool in there.
**[16:20] - V-2 Zeigler:** A pool of what; that&#39;s the question.
[16:20] //V-2 Zeigler crouches in front of water level, equipping Geiger-Müller counter. Technician scans water on Akiva and Alpha settings.//
**[16:20] - V-2 Zeigler:** This isn&#39;t used coolant. It&#39;s full of akivas and the Geiger isn&#39;t picking up alpha rays. Definitely the intake line that is broken.
**[16:20] - V-2 La Paglia:** Good. We can pump it in the sewers and I won&#39;t feel bad doing it.
**[16:21] - V-2 Zeigler:** We&#39;d do it either way. Just don&#39;t have to worry about getting irradiated. Now bring that over here.
[16:21] //RT V-2 feeds hose down the stairs until the floor is met.//
**[16:21] - V-2 Zeigler:** //(Into radio)// Okay, David, shoot.
[16:21] //Water begins being suctioned up by drainage hose.//
**[16:21] - V-2 La Paglia:** Got one going. Should we get another?
**[16:21] - V-2 Zeigler:** //(Laugh)// Shut up, Ross.

**[19:38] - V-2 Zeigler:** We&#39;re good to go in. Ninetail, you coming along?
**[19:39] - Ε-11 &#34;Zulu&#34;:** Where you go, I go.
[19:38] //RT V-2 descends stairs and turns right into BLv.2a. Sound of splashing water is heard with movement.//
**[19:38] - V-2 La Paglia:** Good news, I don&#39;t think any non-fish are going to sneak up on us.
[19:38] //V-2 La Paglia laughs before coughing and covering nose.//
**[19:38] - V-2 La Paglia:** Oh lord, that&#39;s not the smell of wet concrete.
[19:38] //V-2 Zeigler and V-2 Holub begin coughing.//
**[19:38] - V-2 Zeigler:** Myrrh. God, is that strong.[[footnote]] Burns made by holy water emit a smell described as myrrh or chrism. Severity of anathemic burns correlates to the strength of the smell. [[/footnote]] 
**[19:38] - V-2 Holub:** It&#39;s like baking with vanilla extract. The whole bottle.
**[19:38] - V-2 La Paglia:** That&#39;s not getting in your helmet?
**[19:39] - Ε-11 &#34;Zulu&#34;:** No, it is.
**[19:39] - V-2 La Paglia:** //(Pause)// Okay.
[19:38] //RT V-2 approaches far end of BLv.2a. Two 1 ft. diameter pipes for coolant intake and outtake come along west north before turning up into the ceiling. Intake pipe possesses ≈8 in. diameter breach in horizontal segment.//
**[19:39] - V-2 Zeigler:** Oh yup, that&#39;ll do it. Intake pipe completely blown open.
**[19:39] - V-2 La Paglia:** Tate, I think I found the source of the smell. Looks like there was a demon down here. Look.
[19:40] //V-2 Zeigler turns towards V-2 Holub and focuses camera on skeletal remains laying in water. Bones and remaining muscles are chalk white and severely dehydrated. Body is conformed to he fetal position. Skull is devoid of facial feature aside two holes in forehead and several gold teeth in the mouth.//
**[19:40] - V-2 Holub:** Jesus Christ, it&#39;s mummified.
**[19:40] - V-2 Zeigler:** //(Into radio)// This is Vegas-2, we found the breach. Pipe was blown open, and there&#39;s a dead demon down here.
**[19:40] - Ε-11 &#34;Zulu&#34;:** See how the jagged metal thins out like it&#39;s been stretched? That&#39;s implosive damage alright. Possibly pyrokinetic, hard to tell with the brimstone scourged away.
**[19:40] - V-2 Holub:** So the demon blew the pipe open. Blew a few chunks out of the walls too, it looks like.
**[19:40] - V-2 La Paglia:** Why would they blow up a holy water main? That&#39;s like using a welder on its butane tank. Simply suicide.
**[19:40] - V-2 Zeigler:** Well, suicide is the cardinal sin, isn&#39;t it?
**[19:40] - Ε-11 &#34;Zulu&#34;:** Terrorism is always an option. It might&#39;ve had the intention to compromise Site-666.
**[19:40] - V-2 La Paglia:** Imagine hearing him say that first half without context.
**[19:40] - V-2 Zeigler:** What are we doing? Forensics isn&#39;t our job; plumbing is. //(Into radio)// David, we found the breach. Bring in the endoscope. //(To Holub)// Nat, open the out pipe, we ought to check that one for blockage too.

[20:43] //V-2 La Paglia reenters view, pushes pipe aside.//
**[20:43] - V-2 La Paglia:** Tate, are you alright?

[20:44] //Ε-11 &#34;Zulu&#34; kneels down to attend to V-2 Zeigler.//

**[20:44] - V-2 La Paglia:** Them. The bunny grabbed at me and I dropped the pipe on them.
**[20:44] - V-2 Zeigler:** Fuck. I think my arm is broken.

**Summary:** Autopsy was performed with radiation protective clothing as cadaver was releasing low amounts of alpha radiation. This radiation was residual as water retained in dead tissue[[footnote]] SCP-4661-B do not naturally have a body water content, and only consume liquids for hedonistic purposes. [[/footnote]] was expended of Akiva particles.

Cadaver of SCP-4661-B instance was visually unidentifiable due to fourth degree anathemic burns over the entirety of body. Following tenancy check of SCP-4661-B and review of surveillance cameras, the deceased was hypothesized to be &#34;Evenoger&#34;, tenant of Room 27004.[[footnote]] Instance was noted for his collection of precious gems, several gold teeth prosthetics, and protectiveness over both. [[/footnote]] This was confirmed through cross reference of Evenoger&#39;s dental records. Instance is presumed to have died of anathema rather than drowning.

Remains were highly skeletal, with all soft tissue almost inexistent. Horns decayed entirely, frontal bone of skull bearing concaves in area analogous to tuber frontale. Remaining muscle tissue solidified, restricting cadaver to fetal position found in. Weighing of the remains placed at 25.3 lbs. (11.47 kg), approximately 85% of Evenoger&#39;s estimated weight in life.

**Summary:** SCP-7134-07132022 was terminated via single 5.56×45mm round. The bullet entered the body to the right lateral to the throat, going up at a ≈45° ascension. Bullet went through the cerebral cavity, killing the brain instantly. Bullet exited the head through the left planum parietal, posterior to the antler. Autopsy found further miscellaneous damage to the skeleton (vertebral ribs, left ulna, metatarsals, phalanges), most notably the severing of two toes on the hind right foot.

Examination of SCP-7134-07132022&#39;s stomach identified the following contents:
* One (1) ruby. 56 carat emerald cut.
* ≈4 milliliters of blood. Spectrochemical analysis identified as human and SCP-4661-B in origin, sources indeterminable.
* 2 grams of plastinated human calcaneal tendon. Sourced from //Discus Thrower// display of //Bodies... The Exhibition//.
* 10 grams of synthetic rubber and aramid wire insulation.
* 30 grams of Romaine lettuce.

__Addendum:__ SCP-7134-07132022 has been processed into a full body taxidermy to provide a visual profile of SCP-7134 for Site-666 staff, on display in skylobby. Personnel are to publicly refer to Taxidermy №5 as a rogue taxidermy piece titled the //Luxor Al-Mi&#39;raj//.

**Summary:** Malachi Aiden Deacon was killed in action under service of Mobile Task Force Kappa-12. Deacon and his superior officer Christian Fife sustained fatal injury in ambush by SCP-7134-07132022.

Deacon was forced off balance and fell sideways, against a corner piece of hand railing in the northwest stairwell. Deacon&#39;s head struck the angular railing directly upon the left pterion, delivering a fatal amount of blunt force trauma that killed him instantly. Deacon&#39;s body sustained further injury upon completion of fall down several steps, bruising post-mortem. Cadaver also had a single bite mark on the nose matching dental mold of SCP-7134-07132022 upon discovery.

**Summary:** Christian James Fife was killed in action under service of Mobile Task Force Kappa-12. Fife and his junior officer Malachi Deacon sustained fatal injury in ambush by SCP-7134-07132022.

Fife lost balance due to collision with Deacon and the equipment both were carrying, falling backwards on a landing in the northwest stairwell. Fife&#39;s height exceeded the remaining width of the landing, causing his head and neck to strike the wall. This sudden collision forced his neck to bend forward abruptly, removing his skull from the atlas vertebra and causing internal decapitation. Fife may have been aware of his paralysis until he was rendered unconscious and eventual expired from asphyxiation, although concussion sustained might have made this unlikely.

**[21:22] - S-7 Baxters:** Yes. We&#39;re here.
**[21:23] - SCP-7134:** (To Cecil) Seville! I remember you from Newark last summer. Great shot by the way; even the babies felt it. (To Ε-11 &#34;Grant&#34;) I haven&#39;t met you though; who are you?

[21:24] //SCP-7134-07132022 runs between the legs of furniture. Agents attempt to close distance, but are unable to reach with snare poles.//
**[21:24] - S-7 Baxters:** Quit weaving around, you rat!

**[21:25] - SCP-7134:** I don&#39;t even know what that was. How //did// that get there? //(Laughing)//
[21:25] //S-7 Cecil moves to assist Ε-11 &#34;Grant&#34;. S-7 Baxters passes both continuing pursuit.//
**[21:25] - S-7 Baxters:** I&#39;d judge you if this weren&#39;t a chance changer.

**[21:26] - SCP-7134:** Come on, Baxters! I&#39;ve been dealing with these dumbasses for hours, and you don&#39;t need them! Why don&#39;t we have a little one on one?
[21:26] //S-7 Baxters does not verbally respond. Agent unholsters service pistol, fires round towards SCP-7134-07132022. Bullet embeds into table.//

[21:27] //SCP-7134-07132022 look between agents. S-7 Baxters walks up to instance with snare pole equipped.//
**[21:27] - SCP-7134:** You know, if I could see their faces under those helmets, I&#39;d say they&#39;re looking a little angry at me. Did you tell them something bad about me?
**[21:27] - S-7 Baxters:** I have nothing but bad things about you.
[21:27] //SCP-7134-07132022 pauses, turns and looks at S-7 Baxters before chuckling.//

**[21:28] - S-7 Baxters:** //(Pause)// What did you just say?
**[21:28] - SCP-7134:** &#34;Aren&#39;t we cool yet?&#34; That&#39;s a saying, isn&#39;t it? I read it on a piece of paper once. It was a business card or something from this weird skinhead-looking guy I met back in Tallahasse last month. Boy, he was a real piece of--
[21:28] //Sniper round hits SCP-7134-07132022; entering underside of jaw, exiting top of skull.//
[21:28] //S-7 Baxters turns towards west balcony. Ε-11 &#34;Echo&#34; is visible with sniper rifle on Level 29 east balcony.// 
**[21:28] - S-7 Baxters:** [[[clef101|That was textbook.]]] I swear, if she bullshitted her way out with that.
[21:28] //S-7 Baxters holds up SCP-7134-07132022 by hind feet, displaying cadaver to Ε-11 &#34;Echo&#34;. Ε-11 &#34;Echo&#34; salutes S-7 Baxters.//
**[21:28] - S-7 Baxters:** //(Into radio)// SCP-7134-07132022 has been neutralized. I repeat seven-one-three-four is neutralized. Dr. Perot, how are the hellspawn?
**[21:28] - Tech. Hayes:** The SCP-7134 brood has awoken and left the nest. 
[21:28] //Sound of yelling and pyrokinetic activity carries over the line.//
**[21:28] - S-7 Baxters:** //(Into radio)// It&#39;s fine, they&#39;re just spooks. Just keep your demons in check. 
[21:29] //S-7 Baxters turns back to MTF Ε-11-7.//
**[21:29] - S-7 Baxters:** Okay boys. We&#39;ve bagged her, but now it&#39;s time to start cleaning this whole damn mess. The night isn&#39;t over yet.
