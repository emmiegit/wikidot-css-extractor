Anything the Foundation does has a cost. The moral dilemmas that tear people up inside, the reams of death, both purposeful and not, the restless hours of nonstop research.

This does not fall under our purview. What does is the direct monetary cost of everything. Paying personnel globally, the outfitting of an ever increasing amount of sites for proper containment, our growing financial and military competition with other groups, all of these have a noticeable impact on the Foundation&#39;s budget. It is the Accounting Department&#39;s job to make sure this is managed, and that the Foundation at large is maintained to live another day.

And so Area-314, commissioned as the headquarters of the Department, stands as one of the largest department-specific facilities, with a containment capacity of well over 5,000 anomalies, and over a thousand personnel, all working (or being worked) to help keep the Foundation afloat. To that end, numerous Intelligence Constructs and super-computing devices have been produced to both brute force the intense math of finances, and to monitor the ever-changing monetary landscape of both the veiled and under-veiled worlds. 

And, of course, to document and curate the collection of anomalies used. Attached below is a heavily abridged list of the anomalies contained and used at or under the purview of Area-314.

||~ Designation ||~ Date of Acquisition ||~ Information||
||AO-06-6745 || 18-03-1962 || Acquired as part of the Marina Exchange with GOI-012 &#34;Marshal, Carter &amp; Dark LTD.&#34; Object is an ornate gold chalice, fitted with several cut gemstones, with the inscription &#34;Sanguis Auri, Labra Argentea&#34;[[footnote]]&#34;Blood of Gold, Lips of Silver&#34;[[/footnote]] around the rim of the cup. If filled with a liquid and drank by two people (henceforth &#34;subjects&#34;), they will begin deliberating over the monetary value a wide variety of objects, apparently in an attempt to facilitate trade. After a variable amount of time (usually between 45 minutes and 3 hours), the legal ownership of the objects will be transitioned to the two subjects. Note that this happens immediately, and leaves no indication of occurring aside from the verbal exchange itself (I.E there is no legal record of the exchange having taken place, when otherwise such would be left.)||
||AO-06-7329 || 17-05-1968 || A collection of currently 40 //Canis Lupus Familiaris//[[footnote]]Domesticated dog.[[/footnote]], capable of detecting when an individual is being untruthful. This trait is passed down to offspring. Several specimens kept for use, most sold as exotic pets in locations of interest.||
|| AO-06-8433 || 04-11-1979 || Acquired during an inquiry regarding POI-1887[[footnote]]Prolific anartist, known for the use of esoteric materials.[[/footnote]] A collection of an estimated 426 coins, each comprised of a pure material. (As of writing, all are compounds that are solid at room temperature.) When counted, an additional coin will manifest. Coins have been found to be comprised of anomalous compounds, though this happens rarely.||
|| [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3375 AO-06-3375] || 24-04-1983|| A phenomena in which anomalous //Heterocongrinae//[[footnote]]Common garden eel.[[/footnote]] will manifest in public aquariums. Instances will, once fed, burrow for roughly one minute before appearing with a siglos coin.[[footnote]]A small silver coin, used by the Achaemanid Persian Empire.[[/footnote]]||
|| AO-06-12083 || 11-07-1990 || 23 indistinct bottle caps.[[footnote]]So far, no attempt to label the objects as separate has proven successful.[[/footnote]] Objects are perceived as legal tender by anyone nearby, although the precise value is inconsistent and occasionally vague. Acquired following a raid on LoI-9797, an unregistered Foundation front business, following reports of inconsistent and illegal business practice. The personnel responsible have been terminated, and the items --put in deep storage.-- kept in low-value containment at Area-314.||
|| AO-06-13458 || 17-10-2005 || A single Canadian dollar bill. Said bill is always valued at 1$ CAD.||
|| AO-06-17788 || 28-06-2012 || Discovered following a massive influx of public spending in educational sectors in the town of Joliet, Illinois, USA. Fundraisers held within city limits are anomalously productive. Locals amnesticized, and civilian fundraisers are discouraged through the use of other revenue generation throughout the town.||
||AO-06-20180 || 28-08-2018 || A statue of a human tooth, comprised entirely of smaller human teeth. If left unobserved, over the course of 8 hours, it will start to disintegrate into it&#39;s constituent teeth. Item can be remade with additional teeth. Recovered alongside an I.O.U note, and the information of an unknown Finnish bank account. ||
||AO-06-22864 || 02-09-2018 || A large integer that, when represented in its own positional base notation, increases its numeric value, while retaining its cardinal value. The consequences of this are not fully understood. Lakshmi.aic has been commissioned in order to balance Foundation funding in order to approach this value.||
||AO-06-28442 || 04-12-2018 || A previously private boxing ring, where no fighter was capable of winning. Area seized, and opened to the public. &#34;High-stakes&#34; betting is open for all customers. ||
||AO-06-35528 || 23-02-2019 || A recipe, written in Nuragic script, detailing the &#34;proper&#34; preparation and consumption of an unknown type of pastry. Consuming the pastry results in the acceleration of the entire body, including metabolism. Produced pastries sold exclusively to GOI-012, currently at $3200 per crate. ||
||AO-06-42867 || 18-03-2019 || A human male identifying as Dr. Ewan Hayles.[[footnote]]No records of this individual exist in either municipal or base Foundation records, though DEEPWELL records conflict with this. Investigation is ongoing.[[/footnote]] The individual is, for all intents and purposes, not a legal entity, and is therefore unable to be legally prosecuted for his actions (though social prosecution is still possible). Currently designated Asset Tomi of Distributed Task Force Omicron-16 &#34;Finders Keepers&#34;. ||
