[[include component:image-block name=harbingerpic.jpg|caption=SCP-6278-1 inside the kitchen of SCP-6278. Picture taken 1959.]]

**Item #:** SCP-6278

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** 72nd Street will continue to be monitored by the Foundation. Civilians exiting SCP-6278 are to be monitored as part of the Temporal Displacement Programme, with the possibility of detention, memory alteration and relocation in cases of poor societal integration.

Following Incident 6278-2, Foundation staff are no longer able to enter SCP-6278. Alternate methods of detaining SCP-6278-1 are being considered.

**Description:** SCP-6278 is a diner located at 189 72nd Street, Brooklyn, NYC. The diner is identified by a large neon sign saying &#34;Welcome to Marvin&#39;s!&#34; across the front entrance.

SCP-6278 was first opened in 1949 by Marvin G. Morris (1921-1979), a former carpet salesman and sailor in the US Navy during the Second World War. SCP-6278 closed in 1963 due to a lack of business. No further references to SCP-6278 or 189 72nd Street exist after this point; it is omitted on all maps of the area and not mentioned in deeds of sale, city planning records or legal documents. Despite this, the diner is well-known among residents, and the Foundation has collated several oral reports about SCP-6278 stretching back as far as 1969.

The interior of SCP-6278 is reminiscent of a typical American diner of the mid-to-late 1950s. However, visitors to the diner have reported a wide variety of different views from the building&#39;s windows, as well as many patrons who reportedly &#34;do not belong&#34;. Preliminary Foundation observations have noticed several figures wearing unusual clothing emerging from the building.

Date: 29/10/2021

//&lt;Begin Log&gt;//

//The cameras open on a small, 1950s-style diner. The front of the building is dominated by a large red countertop, with a few people sitting at it. Black-and-white tiles cover the floor, and the room is lit up by several bright lights, including some neon ones on the walls. It is unusually clean.//

//A large window is located to the right, opening onto a street. It is raining hard, and the view from the window is partially obscured. Several photographs can be seen above the window. On the left is a series of tables, with a jukebox in the corner.//

//There are 23 customers, mostly seated at the tables. They are dressed in a wide variety of historical styles, ranging from the 1950s to the early 2010s. The majority are looking at the agents.//

//Behind the bar is a white-haired male in his mid-60s, dressed in a red-and-white apron. He is smiling widely. A baseball bat can be seen hanging above the bar.//

**SCP-6278-1:** Welcome to Marvin&#39;s! Can I take your order?

**Agent Svensson:** No, th-

**Agent Parisi:** Sure. I&#39;ll have an omelette and the, uh, chocolate milkshake. And you, John?

**Agent Svensson:** I- I don&#39;t think-

**Agent Parisi:** Don&#39;t be rude, now.

**Agent Svensson:** ...I&#39;ll have a burger. And some water.

**SCP-6278-1:** No problem, sirs, coming right up!

//The agents take seats at the counter.//

**Agent Svensson:** That&#39;s not protocol, we shouldn&#39;t-

**Agent Parisi:**//&lt;hissing&gt;// Shut up!

//One of the patrons - later identified as one Jack Macintyre - turns and looks at Agent Parisi. He is wearing an oversized zoot suit and smoking a cigarette.//

**Macintyre:** You Italian?

**Agent Parisi:** Sicilian. What&#39;s it to you?

**Macintyre:** Aw, I didn&#39;t mean nothin&#39;. Just wondering, that&#39;s all. Hey, Marvin, how about those fries?

**SCP-6278-1:** They&#39;re coming, Jack, gimme a minute.

//After half a minute, SCP-6278-1 emerges from the kitchen. He gives Jack a plate of chips before moving back into the kitchen.//

**Agent Parisi:** Come here often?

**Macintyre:** Sure, everyone comes to Marvin&#39;s. It&#39;s, like, a “community hub”, right? A real hot-spot.

**Agent Svensson:** For which community?

//The conversation quietens.//

**Macintyre:** For ours.

//There is a pause, which is interrupted by Marvin&#39;s return with the agents&#39; food.//

**SCP-6278-1:** Alright, here we are, folks. Get it while it&#39;s hot.

**Agent Parisi:** Thanks. So you&#39;re the famous Marvin?

**SCP-6278-1:** That&#39;s right! This place here&#39;s my pride and joy. Opened it back in &#39;49, can you believe it? But I love it just as much as the day I first laid eyes on the place.

**Agent Parisi:** No doubt.

**Agent Svensson:** Mr. Morris, we were w-

//Agent Parisi nudges Agent Svensson.//

**SCP-6278-1:** ...Not many people who know my last name, y&#39;know. Don&#39;t think I&#39;ve told it to too many folks. Certainly none who&#39;re here.

//There is silence in the diner.//

**Agent Parisi:** What my...//colleague// wants to know is how you&#39;ve managed to collect such a loyal clientele.

**SCP-6278-1:** Folks just like it here. It reminds them of home. I like to provide somewhere warm, somewhere kind, where everybody knows one another.

//The view outside the window darkens for a moment, before returning to its usual state.//

**SCP-6278-1:** But I reckon you know all about that already, am I right?

**Agent Parisi:** ...Yeah. More or less.

**SCP-6278-1:** Well. You two seem like a decent enough sort.

//Several patrons visibly relax. Conversation begins again in the background.//

**SCP-6278-1:** Just don&#39;t go roughing up any of my clientele, alright? I&#39;ve got a reputation to maintain. It&#39;s not easy, looking after this place.

**Agent Parisi:** No problem. Right, John?

**Agent Svensson:** Yes, uh... we&#39;ll see what we can do.

//There is silence for a while as Agent Parisi eats his omelette. SCP-6278-1 turns to wipe down part of the countertop//

**Agent Svensson:** So, uh, how&#39;s business?

**SCP-6278-1:** Business? Ah, it&#39;s OK. I get by. Always have done.

**Agent Parisi:** Really? I thought you ran into a bit of trouble a while ago.

**SCP-6278-1:** Yeah, I guess. But I came through. It&#39;s not so bad now; I can get through one more season, at least. There&#39;s always a way.

**Agent Parisi:** Yeah. There&#39;s always a way.

//There is silence as Agent Parisi finishes his omelette, and Agent Svensson takes a few bites of his burger.//

**Agent Parisi:** Well, we&#39;ll be going now. John&#39;ll take the burger to go. Nice meeting you, Marvin.

**Agent Svensson:** Uh - yeah, sure. Nice meeting you.

**SCP-6278-1:** You boys come back now, y&#39;hear?

[[collapsible show=&#34;+Biographical report on Marvin G. Morris&#34; hide=&#34;-Biographical report on Marvin G. Morris&#34;]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
Morris was born in the town of Rapid Falls in northern Wisconsin in 1921. His father, John Morris (1884-1933), was a carpet salesman from Kenosha, Wisconsin. He married Martha Benvik, of Michigan, in 1910; they had five children in all, of which Marvin was the youngest.

 Little information exists about Marvin&#39;s early life. His school reports describe an entirely average boy, who performed unspectacularly in most subjects, although he did have some degree of mathematical talent and was noted as a strong swimmer. At age 16, he began working in his father&#39;s carpet store, the only of the Morris children to do so; the others had all left Wisconsin by this point.

 His father died in 1938, and Marvin took over the running of the store for the next four years until he enlisted for the US Navy in early 1942. A letter recovered from his older brother Jeb indicates that the family was surprised by this, as Marvin had never shown any kind of patriotic feeling before; it is believed probable that the carpet store was failing at this time, and Marvin consequently needed a different source of income. He performed with distinction aboard the USS Harbinger, receiving the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for unspecified actions during the Battle of Midway.

 Marvin moved to New York City in 1946, and worked as a sales representative at Woolworths for three years. In 1949, his mother died, and he inherited a large sum of money which he used to establish SCP-6278. In 1953, he married Maisie Hollis, with whom he had two children, Arthur and Martha.

 Marvin is known to have been an active and engaged member of the local community, serving on a church board and being involved with several charitable foundations. He was particularly known for his lobbying efforts on behalf of the district&#39;s homeless population, leading to several confrontations with elected officials. Rumours abounded, however, of his involvement in payoffs and minor corruption; none of these stories were ever confirmed, however.

 The diner is reported to have done well throughout the 1950s, but a second letter in Jeb&#39;s collection indicates financial problems in the early 1960s. The diner closed in 1964; an unsigned bill of sale was found in Marvin&#39;s former residence. This is the last known documentation concerning 189 72nd Street.

 Marvin&#39;s later life is obscured. He was apparently working as an employee at another carpet store in 1967, but nothing further is known. Maisie died in 1968 of food poisoning, and Marvin&#39;s disappearance was reported by his children in 1970. A death certificate was registered in New Orleans in 1979, but its authenticity is unknown.

 Date: 04/11/2021

//&lt;Begin Log&gt;//

//The agents have just entered the diner. About 14 patrons can be seen in shot, including Jack Macintryre at the counter. The patrons are dressed in a variety of historical clothing, ranging from the late 1940s to the present day.//

//Outside, it is bright and sunny, and the street is quite busy.//

//SCP-6278-1 is deep in conversation with Macintyre.//

**Macintyre:** Come on, Marv, let&#39;s just go now-

**SCP-6278-1:** Shut- ah, it&#39;s John, isn&#39;t it? And, uh, I don&#39;t think I caught your name?

**Agent Parisi:** It&#39;s Angelo, Mr. Morris. Angelo Parisi.

**SCP-6278-1:** Ah, you&#39;re Italian?

**Agent Parisi:** Why does everyone here - yes, I&#39;m Italian. Sicilian. That a problem?

**SCP-6278-1:** Not at all, Mr. Parisi. Always got time for the Italians. My mother has some family in Italy.

**Agent Svensson:** Really? I thought her family was Finnish.

//There is a pause as SCP-6278-1 turns and stares at Svensson.//

**SCP-6278-1:** Her father was. Her mother was from Naples.

**Agent Parisi:** I must apologise for my colleague&#39;s rudeness. He&#39;s still new.

**SCP-6278-1:** I get it. Lotsa turnover with your lot, I imagine.

**Agent Parisi:** Something like that, yeah.

**Macintyre:** Maybe you oughtta get lost.

**SCP-6278-1:** Now, Jack -

**Macintyre:** No, Marv, I&#39;ve had it with this. You don&#39;t let the regular law in here, why do you let these guys? Who are they, anyway?

**SCP-6278-1:** Just folks, Jack. No need to get antsy.

**Patron:** It&#39;s alright for you to say, Marv, but you&#39;re not - well, we appreciate all that you do for us, but -

**SCP-6278-1:** But nothing, Mike. I say who comes and goes in my own diner, alright?

//The patron, Mike, glares at SCP-6278-1, then gets down from the counter and moves to a table on the other side of the restaurant.//

**SCP-6278-1:** Now, what can I get you gentlemen?

**Agent Svensson:** I&#39;ll have a burger and f-

**Agent Parisi:** Actually, I was thinking you could give us an, uh, demonstration.

**SCP-6278-1:** Oh? You want a demonstration? Well, sure, I can give you one of those, no trouble.

//The windows of the diner darkens. After a moment, the view returns, but the street resembles the mid-1950s; later analysis of the agents&#39; instruments revealed that it had travelled through time.//

**SCP-6278-1:** That do ya?

**Agent Svensson:** Fascinating...

**Agent Parisi:** Yeah, quite impressive. How do you do that, exactly?

**SCP-6278-1:** Ah, well, you know - a magician never reveals. Hey, kid, don&#39;t look at the window too long.

**Agent Svensson:** Uh, sorry. Why?

**SCP-6278-1:** Just... don&#39;t. You&#39;ll start to- to congeal.

**Macintyre:** What do you people want to know this stuff for, anyway? Who do you work for?

**Agent Parisi:** We belong to an... organisation, Mr. Macintyre. An organisation that has a vested interest in people like Mr. Morris here.

**Macintyre:** Hey, how&#39;d you know- ah, forget it. You people know everything, right? The spooks? The men in black?

**Agent Svensson:** Not quite.

**Agent Parisi:** But do we know a few things.

**Agent Svensson:** Mr. Morris, can I ask you about the events of 1964?

**SCP-6278-1:** Well, sure, Mr. Svensson. But I don&#39;t know what you want me to say. This diner&#39;s been here forever; the 60s were a decade like any other. Quite a quiet one, from behind this counter. Always counting change to see if I can survive for one more season.

**Agent Svensson:** Sure. But - well, our records state that your diner went bust in 1964, and yet here it stands.

**SCP-6278-1:** Do they? Well, well. Fancy that. I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t help you there - all I remember about 1964 was that Kennedy was shot. Or was that 63?

**Agent Parisi:** It was 63.

**SCP-6278-1:** Ah, I&#39;m getting old. Things don&#39;t come as fast as they used to.

**Macintyre:** Kennedy? That politician from Massachusetts?

**SCP-6278-1:** His son, Jack.

**Macintyre:** Ah. What a future lies in store for me, eh?

**Agent Parisi:** You look about forty, forty-five... must be the mid-1930s for you, right?

**Macintyre:** Not for long! See, I-

**SCP-6278-1:** That&#39;s enough, Jack.

//SCP-6278-1 heads into the kitchen. Jack continues to eat his eggs.//

**Agent Parisi:** Say, uh, Jack...

**Macintyre:** Yeah?

**Agent Parisi:** Why do you like this place so much, anyway?

**Macintyre:** Well, it&#39;s the company, really. A whole range of folks come through here. Rich, poor, people running, people who want a change... Marvin&#39;s is here for them all. He&#39;s a good honest fella.

**Agent Svensson:** Honest. Yeah.

**Macintyre:** What&#39;s that supposed-

**Agent Parisi:** Nothing, Jack. My colleague just likes to say random words sometimes. You know, like Tourrette&#39;s.

**Macintyre:** Whose?

**Agent Parisi:** Never mind. Just don&#39;t worry about him.

**Macintyre:** Yeah, easy for you to say. You ever feel like there&#39;s a hole underneath you? Everything&#39;s being sucked inside, and everyone around you keeps pointing the knives at you. Pushing you closer to the edge.

**Agent Parisi:** Can&#39;t say that I do. What kind of hole?

**Macintyre:** ...The kind you don&#39;t come back from.

//Macintyre rubs his face and sighs.//

**Macintyre:** Look, I gotta be going. Marv. Marv!

//Marvin appears from the kitchen, carrying a burger.//

**SCP-6278-1:** Here you are, Mr. Svensson. Yeah, yeah, Jack, I&#39;ll get to it.

//Marvin sets the burger in front of Agent Svensson.//

**Agent Svensson:** So, uh, if this is the 50s, does that mean Maisie is here, Marv?

//Agent Parisi looks at Agent Svensson, and cocks an eyebrow.//

**Agent Parisi:** Good question. Yeah, where&#39;s your wife, Marv? How does this time-travel thing work? You shifting through your own personal timestream, or is this place some kind of film, layered on top of the diner&#39;s original form?

**SCP-6278-1:** I don&#39;t - Maisie- my wife will be at home. With the kids.

**Agent Parisi:** You gonna go and see her?

**SCP-6278-1:** C&#39;mon, you can see where this is going. Of course I can&#39;t.

**Agent Parisi:** It was just a question.

**Agent Svensson:** What colour was her hair?

**Agent Parisi:** Another good question. What did your wife look like, Mr. Morris?

**SCP-6278-1:** ... I think we&#39;re done here. Please leave. Come back tomorrow.

//The window darkens again, returning to 2021.//

**SCP-6278-1:** Please.

**Agent Parisi:** Alright. We&#39;ll go for now.

**Macintyre:** Marv, c&#39;mon, she&#39;ll be waiting-

**SCP-6278-1:** Shut up! I&#39;ll take you there next, Jack! You two, out!

**Agent Parisi:** We&#39;re going, we&#39;re going.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+Report by Agent Angelo Parisi on SCP-6278-1&#34; hide=&#34;-Report by Agent Angelo Parisi on SCP-6278-1&#34;]]

 After two interviews and consultation with Dr. Obadiah, the research team currently has two working theories for SCP-6278-1&#39;s motives in the anomalous extension of SCP-6278&#39;s existence.

 The first theory is that SCP-6278-1&#39;s actions were motivated by a desire to preserve his failing business. Analysis of SCP-6278-1&#39;s life after the diner&#39;s closure reveal a man with considerably dimished fortunes and capacity for self-control, leading to the abandonment of his children and a premature death. That SCP-6278-1 would choose to live in the past, at a time when he possessed a degree of wealth and prestige, fits well with the psychological profile prepared by Dr. Obadiah prior to our investigations.

 The second theory is that SCP-6278-1 is an imposter. His reticence to answer questions relating to his family and his apparent familiarity with individuals from multiple time zones is unusual for someone who supposedly disappeared over 50 years ago. Very little personal information has been given out over the course of our interviews, and his M.O. seems unusual, as he is evidently involved in temporal trafficking.

 Many questions are raised by these theories, and a great deal of further research is needed, but these at least seem like profitable avenues of inquiry. As per Dr. Obadiah&#39;s instructions, we will be pursuing them in future explorations.

On 15/11/2021, Agent Svensson entered SCP-6278 without authorisation. He turned his microcamera on shortly after entering, stating afterwards that it was for &#34;safety&#34;.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
//&lt;Begin Log&gt;//

//It is early evening on an overcast day, and a handful of people are visible outside. The diner is mostly empty, with only five patrons inside. One is sitting at the counter, while the rest are all sleeping at a table. They are all wearing dress common to upper-class New Yorkers in the mid-19th century, except for one of the sleeping men, who is wearing clothing reminiscent of late 18th-century France.//

//SCP-6278-1 is behind the bar, writing something in a notepad.//

**SCP-6278-1:** Welcome to Marvin&#39;s! Have a seat, Agent Svensson, I&#39;ll be right with you.

//Agent Svensson takes a seat as Marvin heads into the kitchen. A few moments later, the window darkens for a moment, before the view changes to resemble the mid-19th century.//

**Agent Svensson:** That&#39;s... new.

**Patron:** New? What&#39;s new, boy?

**Agent Svensson:** I didn&#39;t know SC- er, the diner could go this far back.

**Patron:** Of course it can! It&#39;s Marvin&#39;s! It&#39;s a New York institution. Marvin&#39;s is here for everyone, and he always has a warm smile on his face.

//The patron slides down from the counter, nods to Agent Svensson and leaves the diner. Marvin returns from the kitchen.//

**SCP-6278-1:** Oh, is Samuel gone so soon? He&#39;s running up a bit of a tab...

**Agent Svensson:** I&#39;d like an omelette, please, Mr. Morris. And some cola.

**SCP-6278-1:** Sure thing, Mr. Svensson, coming right up!

**Macintyre:** Oh, uh - it&#39;s you. Hey.

**Agent Svensson:** How&#39;ve things been? Did you get where you needed to go?

**Macintyre:** Hmm? Oh. Yeah, I did. 1976. Fun place.

**Agent Svensson:** I see. You don&#39;t sound too happy about it.

**Macintyre:** Lay off it, alright?

//There is silence for a few minutes, until Marvin returns from the kitchen with an omelette and a glass of cola.//

**SCP-6278-1:** There we are, Mr. Svensson... ah, Jack, good to see you again.

**Macintyre:** It didn&#39;t work, Marv.

**SCP-6278-1:** I&#39;m sorry, Jack. Sometimes these things aren&#39;t meant to be.

**Macintyre:** I thought she&#39;d... thought she&#39;d want to see me. Thought I could make things right... she just screamed and shut the door...

**SCP-6278-1:** You wouldn&#39;t have aged a day, Jack. She&#39;d have been shocked. Forty years is a long time.

**Macintyre:** Forty years is nothing. Forty years is chump-change.

//Macintyre sighs, and buries his head in his arms.//

**Macintyre:** I&#39;ll have some fries. To go.

**SCP-6278-1:** Sure thing, Jack. Sure thing.

//Marvin returns to the kitchen. Agent Svensson moves to the stool next to Jack.//

**Agent Svensson:** I&#39;m sorry things didn&#39;t go the way you wanted.

**Macintyre:** Thanks. Thanks, man. Hey, where&#39;s your other half?

**Agent Svensson:** Oh... he&#39;ll be here. Probably. Just something I wanted to check.

**Macintyre:** Oh yeah? More mysteries from the distant future?

**Agent Svensson:** Something like that. Just something that&#39;s been bugging me.

**Macintyre:** Well, just be careful, OK? You seem like a nice kid. Don&#39;t get too obsessed with this place. Marvin&#39;s got a winning smile, y&#39;know? Makes you think all your problems can melt away. But it&#39;s like paper over a deep, deep chasm.

//Marvin emerges from the kitchen and hands some fries wrapped in newspaper to Jack.//

**Macintyre:** Cheers, Marv. See ya, kid.

//Jack leaves the diner.//

**Agent Svensson:** So, Marvin... I&#39;ve been wondering about a few things.

**SCP-6278-1:** Oh? What&#39;s that?

**Agent Svensson:** The others, they- they think you&#39;re a fraud, or a thief. That you stole the real Marvin&#39;s identity for some unknown purpose, or that you have extended this place&#39;s lifespan because you couldn&#39;t handle losing your business.

**SCP-6278-1:** Hah! Well, now, that just goes to show what you fancy uptown boys know about the real world, doesn&#39;t it? You can construct all the clever theories you want, but you don&#39;t know jack.

**Agent Svensson:** How do you mean?

**SCP-6278-1:** Well, real men don&#39;t take these things lying down, son. Real men get back on their feet! They do something new, something noble! Some great endeavour!

**Agent Svensson:** Then why are you here?

//There is silence.//

**Agent Svensson:** They don&#39;t think I should ask you that. They think we should rile you up, keep you uncomfortable. That&#39;ll get you to spill something. Cheaper than an interrogation room. They don&#39;t think you&#39;ll answer simple questions. But I don&#39;t think you&#39;re like that, Mr. Morris.

**SCP-6278-1:** Careful, now...

**Agent Svensson:** Why are we here? Why are you just letting us sit here and talk to you? Why keep this place open? Is it some delusion about clinging to the past, when your wife was alive and well? And if you&#39;re an imposter, why do any of this? It doesn&#39;t sound like something a real person would do. None of this sounds real.

//There is silence as Marvin stares at him.//

**Agent Svensson:** I think... I think you need us. You want us here. So you can survive for just one more season. Welcoming us, telling us to come back after we offend you... you&#39;re zipping around time - all of time, not just from when your diner opened. Everyone around here sings your praises, and never seems happy. You&#39;re not providing any real good, and you don&#39;t seem to be doing anything for yourself. Why do this? Why-

//The door opens, and Agent Parisi walks in.//

**SCP-6278-1:** Uh- welcome to Marvin&#39;s!

**Agent Parisi:** Hi, John.

**Agent Svensson:** Wh- Angelo? But it&#39;s- it&#39;s not the right year...

**Agent Parisi:** You need to talk to Team Δt some time. They&#39;ve got all sorts of tricks. Hi, Marvin. Good to see you.

**SCP-6278-1:** And you, Mr. Parisi. Want another omelette?

**Agent Parisi:** No thanks - I&#39;m full. As is John, here. We were just leaving.

**Agent Svensson:** But- but we can&#39;t-

**Agent Parisi:**//Now//, Agent Svensson. Goodnight, Marvin.

**SCP-6278-1:** G-Goodnight.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
As senior agent in the SCP-6278 containment efforts, I&#39;m officially recommending the transfer of Junior Agent John Svensson.

Agent Svensson was recommended to us on the basis of several promising field encounters during initial containment of SCP-████, up in Maine. He was calm and competent in a combat situation, and his commanding officer believed he would be good material for further training in the interpersonal and investigatory wing, in order to provide him with a more holistic grasp of a Foundation agent&#39;s skillset. SCP-6278 was chosen as a low-risk anomaly where he could &#34;cut his teeth&#34;, so to speak.
  
However, his actions have demonstrated a failure to live up to Foundation professionalism. Our agreed upon strategy, based on Dr. Obadiah&#39;s preliminary psychological profile of SCP-6278-1, was to ask probing, off-kilter questions in an effort to disconcert and confuse him, hoping to catch him off his guard. While this did not yield as many results as expected, Agent Svensson&#39;s actions did not help. He was initially too inflexible when it came to protocol in an unexpected situation, before later asking a series of questions and taking an approach that was not part of our broad strategy.

Incident 6278-1 has demonstrated conclusively that Agent Svensson lacks the temperament for this kind of work. He made an unauthorised visit to SCP-6278 last night, revealing key parts of our strategy to SCP-6278-1 in a clumsy attempt to get information. He continues to pursue leads non-congruent to our current approach, with little regard for the avenues his side-investigations may close for our primary investigations.

Additionally, last week&#39;s discovery of an NYPD cold case from 1945 concerning the body of Jack Macintyre had a particularly startling effect on Agent Svensson. He seemed taken aback, becoming withdrawn and sullen during work hours, negatively impacting morale across the team. The uncertain circumstances of Macintryre&#39;s death naturally had an impact on all of us, but not nearly to the extent seen in Svensson.

In short, I am recommending his immediate transfer back to Maine. We wish him well, but do not feel he is suited for this type of fieldwork.

On 10/12/2021, the day before his scheduled departure for Maine, Agent Svensson used his still-valid credentials to gain access to SCP-6278. He was inebriated at the time, but turned his microcamera on shortly after entering.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
//&lt;Begin Log&gt;//

//The camera shows SCP-6278 at night. It is very late, and the street outside is empty; a single flickering streetlight is visible. Two Native American men wearing Lenape clothing from the late 16th century are heading towards the door, leaving shortly afterwards. There are no other patrons. Marvin can be seen behind the counter, cleaning a glass.//

**SCP-6278-1:** Welcome t- oh. Agent Svensson. I&#39;m - I&#39;m afraid we&#39;re closed right now.

**Agent Svensson:** Yeah, I know. You gonna - heh - gonna call the cops on me, Marv?

**SCP-6278-1:** ...I don&#39;t think so, Mr. Svensson. I think you oughtta sit down.

**Agent Svensson:** Yeah. Yeah, good idea.

//Agent Svensson sits at the countertop. Without taking his eyes off him, SCP-6278-1 takes a slice of cheesecake from a display counter and places it in front of Agent Svensson.//

**SCP-6278-1:** Here you are. Something to help you so- uh, well, something that might help.

**Agent Svensson:** Cheers, Marv. You&#39;re a decent sort, you know that? None of them believe it, but I do.

**SCP-6278-1:** Well, that&#39;s- that&#39;s real nice to hear, Mr. Svensson.

//Agent Svensson starts eating the cheesecake. SCP-6278-1 slowly starts eating the cake.//

**Agent Svensson:** So I&#39;ll tell you what I think.

**SCP-6278-1:** Ah, God...

**Agent Svensson:** I keep going over it over and over again. Why here? What&#39;s here that you want? You don&#39;t seem like too much of a sentimental guy. Why take this place out of time, why stop it from showing up on any documents?

//Agent Svensson takes a bite of cheesecake, chews it and swallows.//

**Agent Svensson:** So I got to thinking. None of your motives make sense, unless... unless you&#39;re not the one who took it out of time. You just reclaimed it when it was all gone.

**SCP-6278-1:** You&#39;re a smart kid. You don&#39;t need to keep going down this rabbit hole.

**Agent Svensson:** Don&#39;t I? Whatcha gonna do, old man? Watch me. Watch me fucking //soar.//

//The window darkens. When it emerges again, it opens on a wooded area. A distant plume of smoke can be seen in the difference.//

**Agent Svensson:** When&#39;s this, then? Which era is this? Which time are you gonna ply me with now?

**SCP-6278-1:** 1587. Before this place was anything.

**Agent Svensson:** Ah, I see! Showing me the sights, eh?

//Agent Svensson gets up and walks to the window. He looks at the photos over the top. They show groups of people from several centuries, mostly smiling. Some are wearing fashions unfamiliar to Foundation historians.//

**Agent Svensson:** Your whole smiling crew. You let anyone who wants to come in here do so. To share, exchange, leave again... you&#39;re a good guy. Always looking out for people. But you don&#39;t seem to care about how happy they end up being. Where their bodies end up. Keeping everyone happy and dancing so they don&#39;t see what&#39;s beneath...

//Svensson takes a photo from the wall. It shows an unsmiling Jack sitting at the counter.//

**Agent Svensson:** I wonder if you&#39;re trying to do something good, Marv. I wonder if you found a way to shove your diner back into the hole it left behind because, without it, there was a hole. A hole in time, in reality. A hole in what you believed was real.

//The window darkens again. A faint, dark sludge can be seen congealing at the corners.//

**Agent Svensson:** A hole, that could contain anything... and what did you do? You papered over the problem. Just keep it together. Keep them smiling. Keep them singing your praises, too, because that&#39;s what you a-

//The camera is suddenly jerked out of Svensson&#39;s uniform, and hits the floor some feet away. SCP-6278-1 is hitting him over the head with the baseball bat from over the bar. He does this several times, before he stops, breathing heavily.//

**SCP-6278-1:** God, I...

//SCP-6278-1 drops the bat. He is crying.//

**SCP-6278-1:** Can&#39;t let them know. Can&#39;t let anyone know.

//SCP-6278-1 sits at the counter, breathing heavily. After several minutes, he gets up, grabs Svensson&#39;s body and drags it to the door.//

**SCP-6278-1:** Just for one more season, until you can find a way to make it //stop//...

//SCP-6278-1 pushes Svensson&#39;s body out of the diner. He goes into the kitchen, comes out with a mop, and spends half an hour cleaning the blood from the floor of the diner. He returns to the kitchen, emerging again after a few minutes in clean clothes. He checks the area where Svensson was killed carefully, but does not see the microcamera.//

//He closes his eyes for several seconds, before returning to the counter. The view outside the window changes to the early 1960s. He suddenly smiles, and the door opens.//

**SCP-6278-1:** Welcome to Marvin&#39;s! Can I take your order?

//The feed cuts out.//
