**Item #:** SCP-1740

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Warning signs are to be placed outside of SCP-1740, claiming it as structurally unstable. SCP-1740 is to be surrounded by a 4 meter high wall, to prevent the viewing of SCP-1740-1. Any instance of SCP-1740-1 found attempting to exit SCP-1740 may be subdued through rope nets. Security personnel are to be stationed in nearby homes at ██-████ █████ Street, and are to administer Class-C amnestics to any trespassing civilians.

**Description:** SCP-1740 is a public playground in ██████, ███ ████. It contains standard recreational equipment, such as slides, ladders, mountable spring animals, and a swing set. Standard materials such as metal and plastic are present, though no anomalous properties surround the composition of any of the equipment in SCP-1740. 

SCP-1740&#39;s anomalous properties originate from its development of SCP-1740-1. A typical instance of SCP-1740-1 is an animate plastic mold of an animal, mounted upon a metal spring. There are currently 9 instances of SCP-1740-1 recorded to inhabit SCP-1740. Autonomous behavior will only occur with instances of SCP-1740-1 if a human adolescent of less than 13 years in age comes within 1 meter of SCP-1740.

Upon nearing SCP-1740, two to three instances of SCP-1740-1 will immediately activate and bounce[[footnote]]Average speed recorded is 1.2 km/h[[/footnote]] towards the adolescent (hereby referred to as the subject), and will attempt to prevent them from leaving SCP-1740. It will accomplish this through repeatedly slamming into the subject. If the subject manages to avoid capture, SCP-1740-1 instances will pursue them as far as 20 meters before returning to SCP-1740. If the subject is compliant, instances of SCP-1740-1 will escort the subject underneath SCP-1740[[footnote]]As in, below the platforms of SCP-1740, which are used to reach the slides and other equipment. [[/footnote]] and will begin to patrol the perimeter.

Subjects will be imprisoned for an indefinite amount of time, as SCP-1740-1 instances display no fatigue or need for nourishment. Subjects will also be provided with water and meals by SCP-1740-1, though they are currently produced through unknown means. Instances of SCP-1740-1 appear to lack peripheral vision, making escape significantly easier for most subjects. However, subjects caught escaping will be forcefully escorted by at least four instances of SCP-1740-1, to what appears to be a miniature guillotine, incorporated into the swing set of SCP-1740. Approximately 1 cm portion of the subject&#39;s toe or finger will be sliced off as a repercussion. Medical supplies such as bandages are then provided by instances of SCP-1740-1.

SCP-1740-A is a set of three wooden benches situated four meters from SCP-1740. Each bench is covered in green paint, and show average wear and damage consistent to being outdoors. SCP-1740-A&#39;s anomalous properties manifest whenever a human with a biological child sits on a bench; any other individual who does not meet these qualifications will not activate SCP-1740-A.

After sitting on SCP-1740-A, a clear viscous liquid will immediately enclose the subject from beneath the area in which they sit. When enclosed by this substance, the subject will immediately enter a vegetative state, and will not respond to external stimuli. The liquid contains several enzymes and electrolytes, though these display abnormalities in [REDACTED], making the identification of a terrestrial species impossible at this time. The only known means of removing this substance from the subject is physical contact with the subject&#39;s biological child, which will cause the liquid to disperse and rapidly evaporate. The affected subject will not remember being incapacitated, and will react with confusion and denial if questioned.

**Addendum 1740-B-2:** A bronze plaque was found welded to the side of one playground structure. The following is the inscription of the plaque:

&gt; We here at Light Courier Enterprises are concerned for your children&#39;s emotional health, moral values, and physical fitness. To prepare your child for an event such as capturination, slavery, and spaghettification, we have designed a simplistic simulation to stimulate their minds and sagacity. While you are held in the widely known &#34;stasis goo&#34;, your children will be completely unable to seek advice from other sources, motivating them to become a singular entity. We hope that this may provide a stronger generation of children, a generation that can stand up to the fear together. Enjoy!
