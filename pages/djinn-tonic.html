++ __Common Charter of the__

[[/=]]
[[==]]
As established by mutual agreement between the Union of Djinns, Genies and Associated Wish-Granters (representatives: Mr. Amn-Guerifah Maloud Shinka Edh Gifeh, Ms. Edora Sylphe) and the Anomalous Individuals Monitoring Bureau (representatives: Ms. Catherine Stern, Mr. Armand Stern) from the SCP Foundation (under O5 Council supervision) on the 9^^th^^ of August 2014.

[[==]]
&gt; Given that: 
&gt; 
&gt; **I)** The Reality Bending entities deemed &#34;Submissive&#34; (Djinns, Genies and others Wish-Granters) are listed to more than 531 //entitates notae// all over the world, and thus are difficult to manage.
&gt; 
&gt; **II)** The Reality Bending entities deemed &#34;Submissive&#34; (Djinns, Genies and others Wish-Granters) are usually bound to objects (oil lamps, carpets, mobile telephones...) or places (waterways, wells, paths...) sometimes difficult to contain.
&gt; 
&gt; **III)** The Reality Bending entities deemed &#34;Submissive&#34; (Djinns, Genies and other Wish-Granters) are sapient anomalous entities endowed with feelings, and thus must be treated as such following Ethics Committee Memorandum #35.9. 
&gt; 
&gt; **IV)** The Reality Bending entities deemed &#34;Submissive&#34; (Djinns, Genies and other Wish-Granters) are anomalous entities, forced by nature to bend reality regardless of their will by following human requests, and thus must be supervised.
&gt; 
&gt; **V)** The Reality Bending entities deemed &#34;Submissive&#34; (Djinns, Genies and other Wish-Granters) occasionally alter reality to a very large degree.
&gt; 
&gt; **VI)** The Reality Bending entities deemed &#34;Submissive&#34; (Djinns, Genies and other Wish-Granters) are hunted and persecuted by several international organizations such as the Global Occult Coalition and the Horizon Initiative. 
&gt; 
&gt; **VII)** The Reality Bending entities deemed &#34;Submissive&#34; (Djinns, Genies and other Wish-Granters) have shown willingness to kindly comply to the SCP Foundation&#39;s decisions.
&gt; 
&gt; **The SCP Foundation** agrees to to give free rein to the activities of the Djinns, Genies and other Wish-Granters providing that they organize themselves in a structured  **union**, regulated and self-managed, under the supervision of the **Anomalous Individuals Monitoring Bureau**.

&gt; Given that: 
&gt; 
&gt; **I)** We, Wish-Granters, exist to carry out the duty that falls to us, namely satisfying human requests that are expressed by a Customer having contacted us beforehand according to the Customs, and thus we have to defend our freedom to do so, according to the Customs.
&gt; 
&gt; **II)** We, Wish-Granters, are able to hold a link and a communication between Wish-Granters, are able to organize ourselves and able to create Rules and Limits between ourselves that the Wish-Granters will have to respect, according to the Customs. 
&gt; 
&gt; **III)** We, Wish-Granters, are able to hold a link and a communication between Wish-Granters, are able to organize ourselves and able to create Rules and Limits between ourselves that the Customers will have to respect, according to the Customs. 
&gt; 
&gt; **IV)** Abuses already have been observed among the most wily Wish-Granters, especially in classical cases of &#34;Be careful what you wish for&#34;, hurting the Customer and consequently prompting distrust among the Customer Base in general, being detrimental to our task.
&gt; 
&gt; **V)** Abuses already have been observed among the most wily Customers, especially in classical cases of &#34;Infinite wishes&#34; and other more subtle stratagems that have been developed since the 1134 Synod decreed the Rule of the Three. 
&gt; 
&gt; **VI)** Wishes of all sorts can impinge those of other Customers, or even turn out to be paradoxical, and what is harmful for the Customers is harmful to our task.
&gt; 
&gt; **VII)** We, Wish-Granters, have a lot to win from the protection of the world-wide organization known as the SCP Foundation, given the animosity of some humans with regard to us.
&gt; 
&gt; **We** accept to organize ourselves to constitute the **Union of Djinns, Genies and Associated Wish-Granters**, a self-managed union whose regulation and actions will faithfully correspond to the **Customs** and the approval of the **Anomalous Individuals Monitoring Bureau** of the **SCP Foundation**.

++ __Composition of the Charter__
[[/=]]
**Article 1:** The Djinns, Genies and Associated Wish-Granters are free to carry on their anomalous activities in contact with civilians without worrying about an intervention from the SCP Foundation, as long as they:
# Tie themselves to no more than one customer at the same time, and do not take another customer before all the wishes of the previous one have been granted. 
# Observe the secrecy clause and do not make themselves known as anomalous individuals outside of their customer&#39;s private circle.

**Article 2:** The Djinns, Genies and Associated Wish-Granters are free to grant all wishes that are requested to them and that they allow themselves to grant, except for:
# Every wish that radically alters the laws of physics and nature on a large scale. Individual modifications or creation of anomalous objects will exceptionally be tolerated.
# Every wish that disrupts national or global sociopolitical balance at the point of endangering, weakening or disbanding the influence of the SCP Foundation. Classical success wishes such as becoming rich or president of a nation are not affected as long as they respect the current sociopolitical order and the AIMB is subsequently informed of the anomalous nature of the customer&#39;s success. 
# Every wish that threatens the Union&#39;s existence or its relation to the SCP Foundation.

**Article 3:** The Union of Djinns, Genies and Associated Wish-Granters is free to create and manage any other rule besides those previously stated. 

**Article 4:** The SCP Foundation commits to never take action against a wish granted by a Djinn, Genie or another Wish-Granter to a customer it is still linked to. However, when the contract established between the customer and the Wish-Granted is fullfilled and when all the wishes have been used, the Foundation is free to intervene and confiscate the SCPs or anomalous locations created, and even terminate the former customer.

**Article 5:** The SCP Foundation commits itself to protect the Union of Djinns, Genies and Associated Wish-Granters as well as all its members from any organization or individual trying to harm them. This especially includes the Global Occult Coalition and the Horizon Initiative. This also includes dissimulation of excessively visible consequences to the fulfillment of a wish.

**Article 6:** In the event of a Djinn, Genie or another Wish-Granter refusing to follow the aforementioned rules, the Union has the duty to report it to the Anomalous Individuals Monitoring Bureau.
# In the event of a failure to respect the rules, the SCP Foundation reserves itself the right to directly take action against the involved customer and/or Wish-Granter, who will be incarcerated before being interrogated, studied or terminated.
# In the event of a failure to respect the rules, the SCP Foundation reserves itself the right to directly take action to counter a wish and nullify its effects or capture any generated SCP objects.
# In the event of a major infraction the Union will be held accountable.
# In the event that the Union refuses to be held accountable, all previous agreements would then become null and void, and the SCP Foundation would not hesitate to deploy substantial means (such as contacting the GOC or the Horizon Initiative) for punitive purposes.

**Article 7:** Exceptionally, the Union&#39;s members are requested not to grant any wishes coming from any person presenting themselves as Dr Bright from the SCP Foundation.
