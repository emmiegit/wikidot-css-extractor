**Item #:** SCP-6420

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** The perimeter around SCP-6420-1 must be guarded at all times. Any civilians entering the area should be turned away and informed that SCP-6420-1 is hazardous and unstable. 

The cadaver of Tal Kinigl, is to be kept in cold storage at Auxiliary Research Facility-19.

When brought into Foundation custody, SCP-6420-2 should be placed in high-security humanoid containment[[footnote]]The search for SCP-6420-2 is ongoing as of 2021/04/15.[[/footnote]].

Two instances of SCP-6420-3 should be held in separate, high-security animal containment cells, and fed orchard hay and flies daily. A cadaver of an SCP-6420-3 instance should be contained in safe cold storage. Any SCP-6420-3 instances not found in Foundation custody are to be incinerated.

**Description:** SCP-6420 is the collective designation for a series of anomalies located inside and in the area of a dilapidated house in rural Michigan. SCP-6420-1 is the former residence of Tal Kinigl and Isa Kinigl. Tal Kinigl is a human cadaver presently afflicted by an instance of SCP-6420-3. 

SCP-6420-2 is a living humanoid afflicted by SCP-6420-3.[[footnote]]The identity of SCP-6420-2 is conjectured to be Isa Kinigl.[[/footnote]] Instances of SCP-6420-3 are parasitic kits[[footnote]]Baby rabbits.[[/footnote]] bearing genomic and phenotypical commonalities with //lagomorphae//[[footnote]]Order consisting of rabbits, hares and pika.[[/footnote]] and //arachnea//.[[footnote]]Order including spiders.[[/footnote]] SCP-6420-3 are ~0.7 cm in length.

When placed on the back of the neck of a sapient humanoid, SCP-6420-3 bites and burrows through the neck into the subject&#39;s brainstem. Reaching the pituitary gland, SCP-6420-3 excretes an unknown hormone.


**Discovery:** On 2021/02/17 agents Joseph Królik and Mackenzie &#34;Macky&#34; Coinín investigated SCP-6420-1 after the Foundation detected low Hume levels in the area.

I woke up in a hospital bed. They informed me that I had been attacked and infected by SCP-6420-2 but I barely remember investigating the house with Joseph. My head feels light and I&#39;m dizzy. I touched the back of my neck and felt the scab the critter left. 

Researcher Davis came into the room and gave me this laptop. He requested that I keep a daily log of my activities and thoughts. Well my thought is that this sucks. I mean, there&#39;s a lot more to it than that. I might be in shock. The last thing I remember is climbing the stairs with Joseph.

The laptop isn&#39;t connected to the internet. I&#39;m bored so I looked for games on the laptop. I like chess, and that&#39;s the only game on it I like.

The hair on my arm has gotten longer and it grows in thick patches. I&#39;m trying not to itch myself or pick at the hairs by instead playing chess and writing. I forgot how incredibly bad I am at chess.

The itching is unbearable and I&#39;m typing this to complain about it. I&#39;m also //attempting// to ignore it. I scratched so hard an hour ago that I bled. Staff patched it up and is monitoring me. They might have to tie my hands up, the itchiness is... indescribable.

Staff had to strap me to my bed while the --hair-- fur grew in the rest of the way. I&#39;m only typing this now because the itchiness has finally stopped.

To keep my mind off of the hare I&#39;m goin play chess! Get it? Hare! I know I&#39;m slowly turning into some horrible critter but I still need to laugh!

07:10

I can&#39;t focus on chess at the moment. I have a splitting headache, I touched the back of my head and found two bumps. I&#39;m going to start crying. 

I alerted staff and Researcher Davis inspected my head. He said he wanted to minimize my pain, but that since they don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen he&#39;s cautious about it.
