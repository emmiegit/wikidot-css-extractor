**Item #:** SCP-6420

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** The perimeter around the property of SCP-6420-1 must be guarded at all times. Any civilians entering the area are to be turned away and informed that SCP-6420-1 is unstable. Tal Kinigl, deceased, is to be kept in cold storage at Site-85. The search for SCP-6420-2 is ongoing. When apprehended, SCP-6420-2 is to be placed in standard humanoid containment at Site-85. 

Only two living instances of SCP-6420-3 are allowed to exist at one time. Instances of SCP-6420-3 are to be held in high-security animal containment and fed orchard hay and flies daily. One dead SCP-6420-3 instance is contained in a small cold storage locker. Any SCP-6420-3 instances not found in Foundation custody are to be incinerated.

**Description:** SCP-6420 is the collective designation for a series of seemingly disparate anomalies, located within and around a dilapidated, rural home in Michigan. SCP-6420-1 is the former residence of Tal Kinigl and Isa Kinigl. Tal Kinigl is a human cadaver presently afflicted by an instance of SCP-6420-3. SCP-6420-2 is a living humanoid afflicted by SCP-6420-3. Instances of SCP-6420-3 are parasitic kits[[footnote]]Baby rabbits.[[/footnote]] bearing genomic and phenotypical commonalities with //lagomorphae//[[footnote]]Order consisting of rabbits, hares and pika.[[/footnote]] and //arachnea//.[[footnote]]Order including spiders.[[/footnote]] These instances are ~0.7 cm in length.  The identity of SCP-6420-2 is conjectured to be Isa Kinigl.
@@ @@
When placed upon the base of a //Homo sapiens sapiens&#39;//[[footnote]]Modern humans.[[/footnote]] neck, SCP-6420-3 will bite and burrow through the subject&#39;s brainstem, eventually reaching its pituitary gland. Following infection, the subject loses consciousness and the wound produced by SCP-6420-3 will heal, leaving a circular patch of scab tissue.

I woke up in a hospital bed. They informed me that I had been attacked and infected by SCP-6420-2 but I barely remember investigating the house with Joseph. My head feels light and I&#39;m dizzy. I touched the back of my neck and felt the scab the critter left. 

Researcher Davis came into the room and gave me this laptop. He requested that I keep a daily log of my activities and thoughts. Well my thought is that this sucks. I mean, there&#39;s a lot more to it than that. I might be in shock. The last thing I remember is climbing the stairs with Joseph.

The laptop isn&#39;t connected to the internet. I&#39;m bored so I looked for games on the laptop. I like chess, and that&#39;s the only game on it I like.

it shard to keep my eyes open im overwhelemed by the sight and the light in the room. my face is numb but it wasnt a little while ago haha, they gave me morphine.

 i dont know what davis wants me to type at this point?? whats going on with me? my face is fucking different, when it grew it felt like my nose was pushed out of my face. but my eyes, my fucking eyes. hot searing pain down the sides of my skull and when my eyes readjusted? the pain was cold and bloomed from where they moved to

im certain i look like one of the critters now but i can t really think about it.

i asked staff why joseph isnt visiting me, they said that he doesnt have the clearance at this point

well //fuck// protocols right?

i heard bones cracking and sinew and and nerves stretch-- the pain ached and was fire and ice-- i vageuly remember falling off the bed and shouting from staff. i woke up with a numb feeling in my legs. they dont feel right. davis calmly informed me that my legs are like rabbit hnd quarters.

i dont have any comments about this, my body still aches, im still hooked to drip morphine, i still cant speak and i cant see anything.

i dont want to think about the pain. i know davis needs my to type but jesus, mary, and joseph i cant describe it!!!!

i was in a dark, gray ocean. salt was on my lips as i swam towards the surface but i couldnt breach, i suffocated and woke up in a blinding white room. it was cold. i heard joseph&#39;s voice and a silloute of a rabbit stood in front of me in the blinding light.

i heard joesph&#39;s voice again and i woke up again. i felt the rough, warm hospital sheets, and joseph saying &#34;shes woken up! she&#39;s woken up!&#34; he asked me how i felt.

im still mute he realized this and got me the laptop... i cried and told him that i dont know what happened or where i was

...im in an intensive care wing in site 85, and davis&#39; research team performed operation to remove the egg sac

joseph said i was out for a month and a half. he&#39;s glad that im alive but i cant stop crying. i&#39;d rather be dead than be //this//
