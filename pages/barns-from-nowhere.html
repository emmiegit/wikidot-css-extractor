This is a weird one, has anyone had any strange experiences with barns? 

I was driving through Iowa and saw something burning by the side of the road. It was a barn. I could make out the truss framing and a few splotches of red paint clinging onto the charring boards. It was mostly gone already. I was going to stop and see why this barn was on fire, someone could have swerved into it after all. 

Then I saw someone in robes watching it burn. Just staring at it. I decided real quick not to stop. 

I&#39;m at a rest stop now trying to find a gas station. There&#39;s another barn next to the place (pic related). Thoughts?

I think I can top that. 

I used to live on a farm, a quaint little place in Iowa when I was a youngling (pic related). I was only with my father then, mom died a little before and dad thought that farm life would be a good change of pace. Good 300 acres of annually cycled corn and soybeans, kinda small. A couple sheep too. Pretty boring when you&#39;re off work, you&#39;d have to make the most of what&#39;s there. Memorize all the divots, the boulders, where the blackberry bushes were. It becomes a kingdom of sorts.

Then the barn showed up. I remember waking up notably later than normal to my father on the phone. He was yelling at who I assumed was our neighbor, dad was pissed at some construction project on our land they&#39;d done. I didn&#39;t pay much attention to this at the time, they always butted heads like bulls back then. 

So I went outside to dick around as usual. And as someone who had memorized every last inch of all those fields and beans and rocks and trees, I was not expecting to see a barn. It was planted neatly into the soybean field as if it was a crop itself. Didn&#39;t look neat though -- for something that had appeared so recently it was fairly worn down. Paint peeling off withered wood, black shingles clinging onto a porous roof. I couldn&#39;t see inside. Light just didn&#39;t enter. At all. I never really went in the thing. For how curious I was, that was pretty unusual.

My dad wanted that neighbor to take it down and refused to do it himself. My father was a very stubborn man, wanted things done the way he wanted with no room for error. He didn&#39;t want me near it either -- it was &#34;too rickety&#34; and &#34;built by a man with a block of wood for a thinker&#34;. I kept my distance most the time, I still noticed a few things about the barn. 

You know how it was all neatly rowed with the crops before? Well, the day after it popped up that barn was slightly off. I knew I wasn&#39;t crazy then so I used my noggin to conduct some very advanced science. I put a stick in the mud at one of the corners of the barn, and waited to see if it would get farther away. Needless to say after a couple days I //really// knew I wasn&#39;t crazy. 

It was turning towards the sheep pen. 

One of our sheep disappeared soon after, but part of the fence had been knocked outward -- made it look like it had escaped. Dad didn&#39;t believe that one bit, he thought the scapegoat neighbor was to blame again. I kept telling him to check in the barn, but he refused. He didn&#39;t want to go in either, just no convincing him. 

The sheep kept going and my dad would blame the neighbor over and over. It was a vicious cycle with a very clear way to stop it. Each time I would plead for him to just go into the barn and he would refuse. He had a look in his eyes that I had never seen before. It was strange, subtle but noticeable. After half of the flock had gone, he finally cracked. Dad went and grabbed a rifle and a lantern in the dead of night -- I didn&#39;t know what he was expecting to shoot in there. He went up to the barn, body shaking enough to nearly cause him to pull the trigger. I could tell what that look was of now. 

He went in and the dark of the barn consumed him whole. Lantern light faded fast into void. I heard muttering, clattering, the occasional swear; suspense stretched time thin. After what felt like forever he ran out in a sweat, blood caked on the bottoms of his shoes and tipped his fingers. I could tell it wasn&#39;t his. He threw the lantern into the barn, a fire dripped onto the paint but dried quick. Now, my dad was a rational man, he would have known that whatever fire he lit on that barn would spread to the soybeans, he wasn&#39;t stupid. But that didn&#39;t stop him from getting the blowtorch from the garage.

It didn&#39;t start aflame at first -- when it did though it went fast. It was already in shambles; a good fire is all it takes to turn the derelict to ruin. Around then I was told to go to the house and stay in my room, as the fire was getting too wild.  

Then it started screaming. It wasn&#39;t animal -- just too articulate for that. However something about it didn&#39;t seem quite human either. I could tell it was the barn -- I just know it was. It devolved into choking after a while and trailed to a charred rasp. I don&#39;t know if I fell asleep that night but I know those rasps faded by the morning. All that was left of the barn was four rotted sheep skeletons and heaps of charred flesh.

But all that flesh couldn&#39;t have come from four sheep.  

We covered the remains up with dirt and that was the end of it really. But here&#39;s the thing: there&#39;s so many abandoned barns in the Midwest from a financial farm crisis in the 1980s. So many people lost their jobs, their homes, but more importantly here: their barns. I wonder how many of them are real sometimes. Sometimes I feel bad about barn-burning because most of them are just barns.

But if you heard those screams, you&#39;d want to burn them too.
