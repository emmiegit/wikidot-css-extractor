**Item Description:** A Type 95 &#34;Kyu-Go&#34;/&#34;Ha-Go&#34; Light Tank, manufactured by a Mitsubishi &#34;Special Research Division,&#34; 1942. Paint had worn away, but the metal beneath had neither weathered nor corroded in any way. A total of six (6) small caliber bullet holes were noted in front hull glacis and turret ring: crew remains indicated death by small arms fire. Armor has thus far proved impervious to any heavy weapon, including but not limited to depleted uranium ammunition and Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGMs). Conversely, bullets of 10mm caliber or less immediately penetrate the armor.

**Item Description:** A DVD of Richard Simmons &#34;Sweatin&#39; to the Oldies,&#34; Volume III (2001.) Content appears in every way to be identical to the standard workout video. However, when observed for more than fifteen minutes by any subject, that subject develops a permanent physiological effect causing them to sweat to an excessive degree when within fifty (50) meters of any human being aged 75 or older. Testing shows that individuals 75 or older exposed to subject still suffer the effect with regards to others, but that there is no additional effect.

**Date of Recovery:** 17/06/1990
**Location of Recovery:** Installed in a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737-200 (registration N█████), Midway International Airport, Chicago, Illinois
**Current Status:** --Installed in a Foundation Boeing 737-200 (identification code ██-██████) used for inter-site personnel transport.-- In storage following the replacement of aircraft ██-██████ due to obsolescence, as advances in aircraft technology had rendered this aircraft more expensive to operate, even with the additional fuel efficiency provided by its use of AO-1124, than a jet transport of a newer model.  All other Foundation aircraft using this engine model had already been retired several years earlier for this reason.

**Item Description:** American flag with 67 stars instead of the standard 50.  Anyone viewing the item directly suffers a cognitohazardous effect that causes them to believe this is the proper number and all other flags are wrong.  Viewing photographs or video of the item does not trigger this effect, which is mild and easily broken.

**Item Description:** Two mummified juvenile //Equus grevyi//[[footnote]] Grevy&#39;s Zebra [[/footnote]] with no visible cause of death. When seen by any animal, that animal will over the following 5-18 seconds lose all ability to comprehend that a zebra can be eaten or poses any nutritional value.
