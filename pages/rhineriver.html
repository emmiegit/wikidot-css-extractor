Deep in the woods of the northeast United States there lives an entity known only as &#34;Rhineriver&#34;. This creature reportedly stalks through the woods at night, using its glowing eyes to see in the dark. Its eyes appear as a pair of flashlights, giving the illusion to unsuspecting passersby of a group of people lost in the woods.

Rhineriver will lure in its prey by calling out to them in a voice resembling a human, asking individuals in its line of sight to critique its writing. It is unknown what happens to individuals who take it up on this offer, as no one who has approached the creature has ever been seen again.

The morning after the disappearance of a person at the hands of Rhineriver, a small piece of paper will be found near the location of their capture. These scraps contain writing, apparently written by the creature, most commonly fictional stories. It is currently unknown if there is any correlation between the story found and the victim of the attack, with one of the most popular theories stating that each story contains a riddle leading to the location of the victim.

Below is a list of all writings recovered following Rhineriver attacks. If you have any more to contribute, leave a comment on this thread or private message me.

The following writings consist of what are apparently supposed to be recovered documentation from some mysterious organization. The sections labelled &#34;commentary&#34; were found written on the back of the scraps and are supposedly the creature&#39;s thoughts on its writing.

**Commentary:** My first work on the site. It&#39;s also my favorite thing I&#39;ve written for the site, and my highest rated. Go figure. I actually didn&#39;t plan on posting anything for a while later than this, but when 6kcon was announced I figured it was as good a time as any to set myself out there. The original draft was much shorter, and only consisted of everything before the second addendum, but then I showed it to my sibling and they suggested I add more to the story. For some reason the idea of a second lobster controlling the ITD crossed my mind in the middle of class and I instantly wrote the rest from there. A couple revisions later (especial thanks to the kind critter who reminded me how lobster fishing works because I was a dumbass who thought you catch them like regular fish) and here it is. I&#39;m still incredibly happy with it and I recommend you read it over any of my others.
**Fun Fact:** The name Andrew Mercury was originally a placeholder based off one of my sibling&#39;s characters. I liked the name and they let me use it so it ended up in the final piece.

**Commentary:** My second article! And one I&#39;m pretty proud of, too. This started out as a silly idea I had during tennis practice one day. There&#39;s a forest near the court I play on and in it there&#39;s these trees that I can&#39;t tell the species of. Thinking about that for probably a little too long gave me an idea for a tree whose species no one can agree on. As I wrote the idea I developed it further and eventually it ended up in the form it is today. This was probably one of the most fun I&#39;ve had writing an article, mainly because I got to learn how to do the Listpages Thing for it. I think some parts of this could&#39;ve been better, but I&#39;m honestly happy with it as-is so I&#39;m probably not going to change it.
**Fun Fact:** I posted this on the same day Series 7 opened, making it one of the first non-6kcon entries in the series, which is pretty cool I think. Also yes, the title is a Lorax reference.

**Commentary:** The original inspiration for this was actually the picture at the top. I took it during a thunderstorm while I was bored and sitting at my desk. I&#39;ve always loved thunderstorms, and they often get me in a productive mood, so I started writing on a whim after taking the picture. This article was originally going to be a lot more. I originally planned to have a whole search log for Merrick with Upsilon-13 attempting to track xem down with increasingly unethical methods. I was also originally going to set this in Deepwell for that reason. I scrapped it because I didn&#39;t really know enough about Deepwell and because personal deadlines kept me from expanding like I wanted to. I honestly think this one would&#39;ve been better if I kept the original story but alas. I&#39;m still decently proud of how it turned out.
**Fun Fact:** Before I came up with the Deepwell storyline that evolved into the current storyline, this was going to be a feel-good piece about reconnecting with loved ones. Oops.

**Commentary:** This is what happens when you come up with the title first. I wrote this while I was on vacation, so if it seems a little rushed and chaotic that&#39;s probably because it is. This went through many iterations before I settled on its current form, most of which were scrapped because they didn&#39;t match with the title. Similarly to 6444, this was originally a feel-good story, and involved Novelty&#39;s citizens escaping a hostile parallel multiverse and seeking asylum in our reality. Again, oops. I seem to have a tendency to make happy stories sad, which probably says something about my writing style. I don&#39;t have much else to say about this one other than that it was really fun to write and it&#39;s one of my favorites of mine, even if some parts aren&#39;t as good as I&#39;d like them to be.
**Fun Fact:** Originally, the series of events we see happen in the flash drive occurred in our reality instead of a parallel one. I changed it literally last minute because the story didn&#39;t sit right with me and I liked the implications of the baseline document compared to the parallel reality document.

**Commentary:** This is my shortest article, and also one of my favorites. Also my most controversial, vote-wise. I was inspired to write this by Aethris&#39;s SCiPtember challenge, particularly day two&#39;s tag &#34;paradox&#34; (even though the article itself didn&#39;t end up having that tag). I developed it from an idea I&#39;d come up with a couple months prior but never ended up doing anything with, and I think I ended up doing pretty good. I love the DoTA and I&#39;m glad I finally got to write something for them. I also wrote this during the great shortform trend of August and September 2021, and it&#39;s probably detrimented a little bit by its shortness, but frankly I like it. And that&#39;s really what matters. Plus, I also snagged a Series IV slot, so that&#39;s pretty cool.
**Fun Fact:** Dr. Salem-Orden&#39;s canonical first name is Evie. If I ever use her again in the future this fact will probably be less fun.

**Commentary:** This one was an absolute blast to write, probably the best time I had writing since 5749. I wasn&#39;t originally planning on writing anything for April Fools&#39; Day but the idea for this crossed me in the middle of class and I liked it enough to develop it further, and I ended up completely finishing the draft by the end of the day. I initially wanted to post this on April 1 itself but I thought it fit better with the story of the article to post it on April 2, and also the community was kind of just having a moment that day and I didn&#39;t want to get involved. This was a really fun world to develop and I really want to use these characters again, but I&#39;m not entirely sure how I&#39;d do that. Such is the way of canonically erasing characters from existence.
**Fun Fact:** The setting of this as well as the image are leftovers from another draft I never finished that sort of got reanimated into this. It was originally a lot more cryptic and boring, and I personally like this better.

**Commentary:** My first tale! Also my first contest entry (not including my deleted memecon entry, we do not discuss that). This tale was very fun to work on, especially since I got to work with my wonderful teammates [[*user Cassandra_Prime]] and [[*user RosySaturniidae]]! It&#39;s probably the single longest I&#39;ve spent on a piece thus far, and I had a really great time. I very much intend on using these characters and this department in the future, and I&#39;m really glad I got the opportunity to participate in this contest, even if our team didn&#39;t qualify. As for the content of the tale itself... eh. It&#39;s not my best. I would definitely still say I&#39;m proud of it, and I don&#39;t think the writing&#39;s bad, I&#39;m just a little dissatisfied with certain details of it. It was pointed out to me that the story of this is incredibly similar to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-foundation-is-broke The Foundation is Broke], a different (and much better) tale, so probably go read that instead.
**Fun Fact:** Ash Conway and Area-314&#39;s names are both math jokes, since I thought it&#39;d be funny. If you can figure them out you get nothing because it&#39;s really not that hard, but you will forever earn the knowledge that I know too much about dead mathematicians.

**Commentary:** I technically have coauthor credit on this page so I&#39;m putting it here. When I first saw Elenee&#39;s announcement about the redesign gallery I wasn&#39;t going to join, but I kept thinking about how great of a project it was and I really liked what it stood for so I caved. I really loved seeing everyone&#39;s reimaginations of ol&#39; peanut in the wake of the image removal, and making one of my own felt like a nice way to commemorate where we all started. I think removing the image was by far the right choice, even if it&#39;s an important part of site history. I do implore you to check out the gallery to see all the art, especially since so many of them are way better than mine. It&#39;s really a nice project, and I&#39;m thankful to Elenee for organizing it.
**Fun Fact:** Here&#39;s some concept art I made before settling on the final redesign:

**Commentary:** My author page. I was originally going to make one when I reached 3 articles... then when I reached 5... then when I reached 6. Here I am, at the time of writing, with 8 articles (7 if you don&#39;t count the art gallery). I actually started working on this shortly after posting SCP-3644, but getting caught up with other things as well as good ol&#39; fashioned demotivation kept me from finishing it. When I first started reading the wiki, having an author page was such an unobtainable goal. It was a sign that you&#39;d truly made it as an author, which I didn&#39;t think would happen for a long time. And now, three years later, here it is. It&#39;s an odd feeling really, but I&#39;m happy to be here.
**Fun Fact:** This is the page you&#39;re reading right now!
