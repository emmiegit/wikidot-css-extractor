**Special Containment Procedures:** Research is ongoing to determine the nature of SCP-7229 and possible containment methods are being developed by the Foundation. At this time, there is no known method of fully containing SCP-7229.

**Description:** SCP-7229-2 is ##4f7ce3|**here.**##

##4f7ce3|**Lately, I’ve been finding myself plagued by the relentless grip of vivid nightmares. In these twisted visions, I am thrust into a nightmarish world, a distorted reality that defies comprehension. It is a place where the laws of nature are shattered, where chaos reigns supreme. The very fabric of this world is stretched thin, barely holding together, and the perception of things is warped beyond recognition. Within this nightmarish realm, I witness countless souls, trapped and tormented. Their faces are etched with despair and terror, existing in perpetual anguish. It is a place devoid of hope, where the weight of fear hangs heavy in the air. Their existence is a cruel dance of suffering, trapped in an endless abyss of torment, in a cycle of perpetual fear and pain.**## 

##4f7ce3|**And then, amidst the swirling chaos, I catch a glimpse of it. Moving through the nightmare world with an unsettling grace, manipulating people like chess pieces on a game board. The very essence of the universe responds to its will, warping and contorting at its command. As I observe this figure, its features remain obscured, shrouded in a veil of mystery. Its form seems to shift and morph, evading comprehension. One moment it appears as a shadowy specter, the next as a radiant being formed from the blinding light of a thousand stars. Its true nature eludes my grasp, defying the limitations of mortal understanding.**##

##4f7ce3|**With a wave of its ethereal hand, the entity unleashes its power, manipulating the very fabric of this distorted reality. The landscape twists and contorts, forming grotesque shapes and monstrous manifestations. The denizens of the nightmare world writhe in torment, their screams of anguish echoing through the air. People are subjected to unimaginable horrors, their perceptions are warped beyond recognition, and their minds are assaulted by the entity&#39;s nightmarish creations. As the chaos unfolds, the entity watches intently, its gaze fixed upon the unfolding horrors. Its eyes, filled with an otherworldly luminescence, survey the torment it has wrought upon the hapless victims. With each passing moment, the entity&#39;s focus sharpens, its influence intensifying, and then…. I wake up. This is when my dreams would usually shatter. When the horrors would fade into the recesses of my mind, and I would get up gasping for breath, relieved that it was all just in my mind.**##

##4f7ce3|**Last night, however, it was different. As I reached this familiar juncture, my dream refused to release its grip on me. The nightmare persisted, the entity&#39;s presence unyielding. It was as if the boundaries between dream and reality had blurred, trapping me within the sinister embrace of this twisted realm. And this time, within the nightmarish landscape, as the creature stood as a macabre observer with its gaze fixed upon the horrors it had conjured, a growing dissonance began to emanate from it. Through the veil of that distorted realm, the visage of the entity materialized before me, with its once inscrutable face now exposed to my gaze, a visible frustration began to taint the ethereal canvas of its countenance.**##

##4f7ce3|**As it moved people with calculated precision, each step was now imbued with a sense of urgency. It seemed driven by an insatiable desire, relentlessly transforming its surroundings as if striving towards an elusive goal that eluded comprehension. Its actions, once methodical, became increasingly frenzied and desperate. The nightmare world trembled under the weight of its influence, warping and distorting with each movement.**##

##4f7ce3|**And then, for a fleeting moment, it ceased its relentless machinations. It once again assumed its role as a silent observer, fixated and unwavering in its gaze as it became immersed in the unfolding scenes of terror and despair. Gradually, almost imperceptibly, its expression began to shift. Lines etched across its otherworldly visage, contorting into an expression of profound sadness; revealing a deep sorrow as tears began to stream down its face. I stared in disbelief with a mixture of confusion and curiosity. And then, as I watched, captivated yet unnerved, it turned its gaze directly toward me, and an overwhelming sense of dread washed over me.**##

##4f7ce3|**The entity&#39;s eyes bore into my very soul as if peering into the depths of my being. And in that harrowing moment, I felt a profound connection. The boundaries between us blurred, and I became privy to a tumultuous symphony of sensations and fragmented desires surging through my being, defying the boundaries of comprehension. It was as if I had stepped into a realm far beyond the limits of human understanding, where concepts and emotions intertwined in unfathomable ways. I could taste the bitter longing, the discordant notes of frustration, the haunting echoes of unfulfilled purpose, and so much more. Then, as the connection deepened, a shroud of darkness enveloped me, spreading toward every fiber of my being. It was an all-consuming darkness. In this crescendo of emotions, beyond the boundaries of my own comprehension, I surrendered to the boundless abyss.**##
