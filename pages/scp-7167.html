**Item #:** SCP-7167

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** 
SCP-7167 is currently contained within standard Humanoid Housing Units 67 and 68 at Site 15, and is to be cycled between the aforementioned rooms (along with any amenities it currently possess) every two weeks for deep-cleaning of its quarters. It is to be monitored via audio and video surveillance systems within its quarters, and must have a facially obscuring apparatus worn on its person at all times, except for in controlled testing environments. Human-Type Amenities Packages are to be delivered to SCP-7167 daily for sustenance purposes. Additional items for the purpose of recreation or testing may be given by researchers currently supervising SCP-7167, or at the request of the being itself. (If deemed reasonable by residing researchers.)

**Description:** SCP-7167 is a Caucasian male estimated to be of early pre-adolescent age; though its exact age is unconfirmed. It is assumed to have a regular human lifespan and ages at an average rate, although this is a mere estimation based on aging that has been observed by the Foundation during its containment.

 The being is either unwilling or unable to speak to Foundation personnel in most cases, though it is able to read and comprehend English to a seemingly fluent degree. Whether this is an inherent mental detriment that has onset it or an unwillingness to cooperate is unknown, and currently being tested. Additional testing has shown it to not be physically impaired of speech, as the respiratory system, vocal cords, and facial structure are undamaged and capable. SCP-7167 seems notably unwilling to attempt other forms of communication with Foundation personnel in most cases. No attempts at escape have taken place as of the current date, and SCP-7167 has only been shown to cause any form of bodily harm  once, and the event was believed to have been caused indirectly by its effects, not out of malice. More on this event can be seen in the testing  records below.

  SCP-7167&#39;s anomalous properties are centered upon its frontal facial area, and are only triggered when this area is visually witnessed by a sapient individual. When any such individual attempts to look at the facial area of SCP-7167; some outside force will always prevent such from happening so that the individual will either be unable to witness or recall the appearance of 7167&#39;s face. No known measures have been known to stop this from happening, though tests are ongoing. Attempting to digitally record images of SCP-7167&#39;s facial structure likewise result in seemingly random events that prohibit such from being possible. To prevent any possible collateral damages or incidents stemming from this, SCP-7167 is to wear a facially obscuring apparatus with one-way visibility at all times, except in testing environments.

 Genetic analysis of SCP-7167 indicates no inherent anomalous properties and indicates the being as human, and it is unknown if the being&#39;s anomalous effects stem from SCP-7167 itself or from an outside force that is centered upon it. The Foundation was made aware of SCP-7167&#39;s existence when all parameter surveillance around the entrance of Site 18 suffered various electrical issues simultaneously due to witnessing of the face of SCP-7167. The being went willingly back to the facility with Foundation custody sent to solve the electrical issues, reportedly requesting that it be &#39;Brought where it could be alone.&#39; This is the only recorded instance of SCP-7167 talking in full sentences, though it has been shown to mumble to itself whilst alone in containment. SCP-7167 has not been coerced into disclosing information of its life before being brought into custody as of date, and attempting to trace any records of the being has proven difficult due to its anomalous effects on recording devices and witnessing individuals.

**Testing Addendum:**


||~ **Testing Individual** ||~ **Test Parameters** ||~ **Test Results** ||
|| Doctor Garrison || //Doctor Garrison covers their eyes with an opaque fabric, and SCP-7167 is seated before them whilst not wearing their facial concealment apparatus. Doctor Garrison then removed the fabric, attempting to witness SCP-7167.// || An immediate shortage of the lighting equipment in the testing cell resulted in a total loss of visibility. Doctor Garrison departed the testing area, and the electrical issue resolved itself without human intervention.||
|| Doctor Garrison || //Doctor Garrison and SCP-7167 are escorted to a secure outdoor courtyard of Site-15, in similar circumstances to the initial tests, to negate the possibility of electrical issues. Doctor Garrison moved to remove his fabric facial covers.// || Upon attempting to remove his obscurement, a wild individual of //Falco Peregrinus// dove at Doctor Garrison seemingly unprovoked, but was terminated by armed escorts before bodily harm took place. SCP-7167 was not viewed due to the resulting shuffle.||
|| Doctor Garrison || //SCP-7167 and Doctor Garrison are seated in an sealed outdoor testing cell with a translucent roof in order to negate the possibility of animal interference and electrical issues.// || Moments prior to the beginning of testing, a minor hostile breach of Site 15 took place, requiring testing to be postponed. Later investigation showed the assumed breach to be a false alarm. ||
|| Doctor Garrison || //Same circumstances as previous test.// || Upon removing his opaque fabric as per planned, Doctor Garrison suffered a minor epileptic seizure, to the supposed distress of SCP-7167, and was swiftly taken to the Medical Bay. Only noted instance of indirect bodily harm stemming from SCP-7167, testing changed to D-Class individuals only. ||
|| D-32907 || //D-32907 and SCP-7167 are seated in a regular testing chamber, with only D-32907 wearing facial coverings. D-32907 is instructed to feel the face of SCP-7167 without removing their coverings.// || D-32906 reported feeling an ‘average human face’ and seemed to elicit and feel facial expressions of distress from SCP-7167; which promptly pulled away from D-32906 after a few seconds. ||
|| D-10815 || //D-10815 is given a SLR Film-based camera, a facial covering, and seated before SCP-7167. D-10815 is then verbally directed to photograph SCP-7167.// || Notably, the photo was taken successfully. Post-Development of the film, chemical residue resulted in splotches obscuring the facial area of SCP-7167 in the finished photograph. Photograph sealed in Non-Anomalous Item Storage for later testing and analysis.||
|| D-513131 || //D-513131 is given a set of 4KB Night-Vision Goggles, and instructed to carry them until given further instructions. SCP-7167 and D-513131 are seated in a standard testing room with all lighting systems off, and given fifteen minutes to adjust to the sheer darkness. D-513131 is then told to wear and activate the Night-Vision equipment.// || Spontaneous electrical surges occurred in the Primary and Secondary lighting systems of the testing chamber, triggering a sudden reactivation of the room’s lighting systems. The sudden burst of light, combined with the acclimation to darkness and the worn 4KB Night-Vision Goggles, D-513131 was dazed and disoriented until the test’s end. Again, the face of SCP-7167 was not viewed.||
