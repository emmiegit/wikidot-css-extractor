&gt; //I have always been a firm believer in the proposition that even in the most preposterous of myths, there lies a kernel of truth.//

**Introduction:** The Foundation, in its current incarnation, dates back about a hundred years at most. Parent organizations, such as the ASCI and HMFSCP, go back a couple centuries more. But the anomalous has always existed.

In the days before the unexplainable could be safely tucked away and hidden beneath the all-encompassing Veil, they became our stories, passed down through literature and oral tradition. Over time, specific details may become exaggerated or forgotten, or be intentionally altered and absorbed into wider religious narratives.

The Department of Mythology and Folkloristics, one of the Foundation&#39;s oldest divisions, is tasked with studying the role the anomalous has played in the development of myth and legend. Much of this involves sorting fact from fiction, although occasionally, these stories from ages past may offer unique clues and insight into anomaly protection and containment protocols.

Contrary to popular belief, the Department&#39;s work is not restricted solely to the study of ancient mythology. More modern legends and folktales are of equal interest - this can include anything from medieval myths to fairy tales to urban legends.

**Writing Tips:** There really aren&#39;t any hard and set rules on writing an article for the Department of Mythology and Folkloristics. My only real suggestion is that articles utilizing this Department evoke a sense of //wonder//. If you&#39;re interesting in writing about them, it&#39;s a safe bet that you&#39;re interested in real world legends and mythology - which is good! But if you want to write an SCP or a tale inspired by folklore and fairy tales, I would strongly advise putting a unique spin on the source material - simply writing about a banshee, a werewolf, or a skinwalker without any twist probably won&#39;t cut it.

Writing stories about invented myths is not only allowed, it&#39;s encouraged! If you have an idea for an imaginary legend and an interesting story behind it, by all means, write it - that&#39;s what this Department is for. There&#39;s plenty of potential for fleshing out the mythology of the [[[SCP-140 | Daevites]]], the [[[Church of the Broken God Hub | Mekhanites]]], or the [[[SCP-1483 | Antarcticans]]] - heck, even older civilizations, like the [[[SCP-1000 | Children of the Night]]] or //[[[SCP-6204 | Sapiensaurus]]]//.

And above all else, as with anything else on this site, have fun!

//- Dr Leonerd//
