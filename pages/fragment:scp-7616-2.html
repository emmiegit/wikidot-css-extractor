I’m going to be completely honest, I don’t feel entirely comfortable doing this ritual. I mean, obviously, I am probably condemning myself to Hell for eternity. But I’m talking more about the “collect my own blood” part.

Even without that fourth step, I… don’t think I can cut myself. I’ve been trying and… I just CAN’T. Self-preservation kicks in and I get scared… But I NEED to do this.

# Thrust a blade towards your heart, so that its hilt meets your pectoral.[[footnote]] 
I’ve been thinking about this for a while now, and believe it or not, I don’t think I’m supposed to stab myself in the heart. So far, I’ve been cheesing every part of this ritual because the vague wording’s let me do it.

I’ve interpreted “poison” to alcohol, and found a way to “collect my blood” without hurting myself. So, I can probably interpret “thrust a blade towards my heart, so that its hilt meets my pectoral” as NOT killing myself. 

It says “a knife or knives of any kind,” so I think I can just use one of those actor’s knives. The ones with a blade that goes into the hilt, so it LOOKS like I’m being stabbed. Or… You know, I could probably just use the knife backwards, so I’m pressing the butt of it into my chest. The blade is still being thrust towards me, just facing in the other direction.

I mean, I’d look stupid, but… I’m definitely supposed to be reading in between the lines, here. I’m clearly not supposed to die.
