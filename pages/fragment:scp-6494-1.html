**Special Containment Procedures:** Effective October 14 2006, Foundation personnel are to devote all possible resources towards the containment of SCP-6494, and towards preservation of the Veil.

Use of outsourced containment resources and consultants has been authorized for the containment of SCP-6494. Consultants are to be considered Level 5 personnel.

On the first day of each month, Foundation personnel are to perform Procedure 411-Asgard in any attempt to delay SCP-6494. Exactly seven individuals are required for Procedure 411-Asgard. These seven people (arbitrarily^^##red|footnote missing##^^ designated Asgard-1, Asgard-2, etc.), are to perform the following steps:
* **Asgard-1:** Oversee the operation, and is to contact Asgard-7 upon the events conclusion. At no time is Asgard-1 permitted to vocalize except to declare the start of Procedure 411-Asgard and declare the end of the Procedure.
* **Asgard-2**, **Asgard-3:** Asgard-2 and Asgard-3 are to be blindfolded, back to back. Upon the start of the event, for twenty seconds, Asgard-2 and Asgard-3 are to raise their hands to be parellel to the ground floor, with their palms open towards the sky.
* **Asgard-4**, **Asgard-5:** While Asgard-2 and Asgard-3 have their arms extended, Asgard-4 and Asgard-5 are to utilize a ritualistic knife (designated Asgard-0) to draw blood from Asgard-2 and Asgard-3. Any amount of blood is sufficient. Upon utilizing the knife, they are not permitted to concurrently lose eye sight of Asgard-2 and Asgard-3. They are advised to coordinate blinking patterns as to avoid overlap.
* **Asgard-6:** After Asgard-0 is utilized, Asgard-6 is to take Asgard-0 and deliver it to Asgard-7.
* **Asgard-7:** Upon receiving Asgard-0, they are to notify Asgard-1, before claiming their own life utilizing Asgard-0.

Sixty seconds after Asgard-7 notifies Asgard-1 of the arrival of Asgard-0, Asgard-1 is to declare Procedure 411-Asgard complete.

The procedure cannot be varied.

**Description:** SCP-6494 refers to one of many duplicate items found in crates during an exploration of ███████. Each instance of SCP-6494 appears to be a traditional Ultra Pro brand deckbox for the card game //Magic: the Gathering//. The box is capable of holding up to 100 sleeved cards and shows no anomalous properties when empty or when storing cards.

However, if a sleeved ‘commander deck’ of cards is used^^##red|footnote missing##^^, the cards will show anomalous properties, and are able to create whatever the card depicts without flaw. These apparitions are known as SCP-6494-02. For the purposes of being able to tell all instances of SCP-6494-02 apart, additional names have been given, as per the printed English card name.^^##red|footnote missing##^^

**Special Containment Procedures:** These files are to be manually deleted from RAISA archives for inadequacy on October 30 2020. Junior Researcher Amity Thorn is to be informed of her failure.

**Description:** SCP-6494 refers to an anomalous entity first sighted in the rural town of Blackawton, Devon, in 2007, and has since been seen one-hundred-twenty-seven (127) times internationally. It is believed that SCP-6494 is some form of personified cognitohazard^^##red|footnote missing##^^, although further evidence into this is to be attempted. Those who hear SCP-6494 note it sounds like an influential but unfriendly figure in their life.

SCP-6494 appears to provide some type of compulsive cognitohazard, causing obedience and/or ritualistic devotion towards itself to specific persons. Persons who witness SCP-6494 without meeting a list of criteria appear to be completely unaffected by SCP-6494 or its presence. The following criteria has been noted in all persons effected by the compulsive hazard.
* Between the age range of twenty-two and thirty-three.
* Has suffered from some type of mental health disorder at some point in their life, no matter how brief. People who still suffer from a given disorder do not seem to apply.
* Could be considered &#39;lonely&#39; (i.e., being an only child; introverted personality; lives in a secluded location, or guilt in interpersonal affairs).
Due to Mobile Task Force protocols and standards^^##red|footnote missing##^^, no Mobile Task Force is to be assigned to SCP-6494 without psychological examination.

SCP-6494&#39;s initial containment squad and Class-D personnel who interacted with SCP-6494 showed an express interest in arguing for SCP-6494, as well as behaviors not commonly associated with them prior to exposure to SCP-6494^^##red|footnote missing##^^.

**Description:** SCP-6494 refers to an anomalous entity created through unknown means that has manifested eight-hundred-eighty-eight (888) times internationally since 2007 on an approximately weekly basis. 6494-Events refer to manifestations of SCP-6494. SCP-6494&#39;s appearance is inconsistent, but primarily takes the appearance of a bipedal entity with no discernible features or traits.

SCP-6494 is non-hostile unless engaged, but those in its presence are known to hear vocalizations akin to human speech. Those who hear SCP-6494 acknowledge that it sounds like an influential but unfriendly figure in their life. Additionally, SCP-6494 possesses an ability to demanifest instantaneously.

**Interviewed:** Junior Researcher █████ █████

**Interviewer:** Site-███ Director █████ █████

**Foreword:** The following interview was conducted.^^##red|footnote missing##^^

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**█████ █████:** Hello, Amity, sit down, I got you hot chocolate, I know you don&#39;t actually like coffee.

**█████ █████:** Thank you so much, yeah. I need an ungodly amount of sugar, can&#39;t be healthy. Anyway, what did you want to talk about?

**█████ █████:** To be honest, work sadly. We need to talk about your productiveness recently.

**█████ █████:** Honestly, Tiana, just time, dedication, and stubbornness.

**█████ █████:** It&#39;s kinda strange. You&#39;re extremely dedicated, it&#39;s clear, but you haven&#39;t actually handed anything in. How come?

**█████ █████:** I think a lot of my inspiration comes from the weird things in my own life, so I know how to articulate things. Although, I&#39;ve always been a fan of horror, so that&#39;s always going to come in handy.

**█████ █████:** Being a perfectionist surely can&#39;t be it. You&#39;ve stayed overnight here three nights in a row now. You need to talk a break or you&#39;re going to kill yourself.

**█████ █████:** Plus, think about how much there is to draw from. I know what makes a good object, so I just need to find the words.

**█████ █████:** SCP-6494? You&#39;re not on that though, unless? I mean, I could transfer it over to you, but I honestly don&#39;t think you&#39;d be satisfied. We&#39;re pretty sure it&#39;s getting decommissioned anyways.

**█████ █████:** From there, it all flows onto the canvas and things feel fine. Metaphorically, though, I type it. Obviously, though. Maybe a painting SCP?

**█████ █████:** Amity, are you hearing yourself? This isn&#39;t good, you can say you&#39;re a &#34;dedicated worker&#34;, but does sleeping in your cubicle and living off cafe coffee sound acceptable to you? If you don&#39;t get your act together, I&#39;m gonna have to transfer your department.

**█████ █████:** And see, that&#39;s how I get my ideas! One-off comments, painting words. Maybe some sort of cognitohazardous painting that has some sort of text. Maybe I could even make that pipe painting, you know? I&#39;ve always hated it, but maybe I could do something with it. Do other people hate it?

**█████ █████:** Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not jumping to any definitive punishment. I&#39;m probably just gonna give you a few days off, you&#39;ve got your eye on that girl down in Logistics, don&#39;t you? Maybe take the week of Valentine&#39;s off, you could use it.

**█████ █████:** Ah, I tend to ramble. But, yeah, Tiana. If you ever need a hand writing, just ask me, I&#39;m always open to working with others. Well, not always, but I&#39;m sure we could here or there. Maybe if I need you I could get a hand?

**█████ █████:** I can tell you aren&#39;t happy, but it&#39;s for the better. Anyway...

**█████ █████:** Yeah, I should get going too. Thanks for the coffee.

**█████ █████:** Anytime. I&#39;d love for you to reach out.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** █████ █████ seemed out of it the entire time. She really needs to take a small work break.
