Well, shit.
 
Yeah, I&#39;d say you got the bastard.  They don&#39;t get much more dead than that. 
 
Okay, calm down.  You&#39;re not gonna get D-Classed.  Breathe, kid.
 
Here&#39;s what happened.  You&#39;re not the one who shoved him off the building with a live grenade.  You were doing your honest best t&#39;follow orders and take the bastard in alive.  You were doing just fine, too, until Nobody killed him.
 
Well, yeah, obviously, someone killed him.  I meant Nobody, the person.  Or people.  Or whatever.  You&#39;ve heard of Nobody, right?
 
Yeah, that one.  Does mysterious shit, helps or hurts us, an&#39; then he disappears.  He&#39;s the one who did it, understand?
 
No, it&#39;s not exactly lying.  Okay, so it&#39;s lying, but it&#39;s lying to cover your ass, which is practically a moral obligation at this point.
 
Look, you&#39;re new, so I&#39;m gonna let you in on a little secret.  Everybody wants things to be simple.  They want the world to make sense.  Even the higher-ups. Sure, they know the world&#39;s fucked up, but they want it fucked up in a way they understand.  Things out here, in the field, they get messy.  Sometimes, we gotta do things they wouldn&#39;t understand.  And sometimes we make honest mistakes.  The higher-ups don&#39;t wanna think that sorta thing happens.  We&#39;re their hands and eyes.  We go out, we fix problems for them, and so far as they&#39;re concerned, we always do it the way they want.
 
Like, sometimes maybe you end up needing help from outside.  We all know the other guys in the GOC, or MC&amp;D, or hell, even in the CI.  We trade favors when we have to, but the higher-ups wouldn&#39;t understand it, and they&#39;d fuck it all up.  Or maybe they want us to take in something alive that turns your blood to fire by lookin&#39; at you, and never mind how you&#39;re supposed to get it done.
 
We do what we gotta do.  We try to make the mission go through.  Sometimes, that means we gotta do things they wouldn&#39;t like, sometimes it means we cut our losses.  And then, when you write up the report, you gotta make everything nice and neat in a way the higher-ups understand.  That&#39;s where Nobody comes in.
 
Everyone knows Nobody does shit that doesn&#39;t make much sense.  Sometimes he helps us, gives us information, works with us.  Sometimes, he comes in and fucks it up.  The higher-ups, they //understand// about Nobody.  They don&#39;t like him, but they accept that he exists and that there&#39;s not much we can do about it.  So, when we write up these reports, he&#39;s real handy for tying up loose ends.  At the end of the day, the mission gets done the best we can do it, and the higher-ups get a story they can swallow.
 
So kid, you didn&#39;t do it.  You tried to take the skip in alive, but Nobody got in the way.  Said some mysterious crap, I&#39;ll come up with that, and then left before we could stop him.  Maybe jumped off the rooftop.  He does shit like that, after all.  He&#39;s Nobody.
 
Is he real?  I dunno, kid.  Ask him yourself sometime.</textarea></pre>
