**Project #:** SPC-2191

**Selachian Pugnātorial Capabilities:** The Centre is to maintain surveillance operations, but is otherwise not to act with vehemence against SPC-2191 or the practices within the vicinity of Mangalia, Romania. Exploration of SPC-2191 is prohibited solely outside of remotely controlled submersibles. Operatives are to maintain the facade of working for the coast guard in the employment of the Romanian government. In the event of an SPC-2191 security breach by any locals, lethal punching is authorized. 

**Project Components:** SPC-2191 is a sunken temple complex located off the coast of Mangalia, Romania. The first two floors of the structure hold a close resemblance to Eastern Orthodox monasteries commonly found in the region. Due to water damage, some of the murals depicted on the walls have faded away, revealing pro-Selachian propaganda hidden underneath. This is suspected to have been a deliberate effort to disguise the true nature of SPC-2191. Thracian and Dacian architecture have both been discovered in the lower levels of the temple complex and artifacts belonging to the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture have been recovered from the system of tunnels that makes up the lowest known portion of SPC-2191. The underwater caverns of SPC-2191 are not thought to have formed naturally, and while it was initially hypothesized to be one of the many sunken cities that formed during the Ceausescu era, carbon dating shows SPC-2191 was likely constructed ca. 4800 to 3000 BC.

SPC-2191 is inhabited by a population of deep-sea organisms designated as SPC-2191-1. Instances of SPC-2191-1 are considered genetically selachian, but have undergone several significant, seemingly fatal mutations. SPC-2191-1 instances lack all major internal organs with the exception of the stomach, gill arches, and forebrain. The outer epidermis lacks pigmentation and displays a condition that renders their skin spotted with grey and white spots, possibly related to Leucism. The body is covered in a thick layer of chitin, allowing for natural protection against most rudimentary punches.[[footnote]] See Addendum 2191.1: Exploration Log [[/footnote]] Entities appear androgynous, lacking or having somehow removed secondary sex characteristics. Their regressed eyes are covered by a layer of skin, rendering them mostly blind, but still able to react to light (universally displaying aversion to wavelengths &gt; 75 nm).[[footnote]] This is most likely due to the lack of light that SPC-2191 receives due to its location being deep in the ocean. The SPC-2191-1 instances most likely evolved to gain a low tolerance of light sources, and a heightened sense of smell. [[/footnote]] Further deviations from baseline //Selachimorphas// include especially thin, sharp dorsal fins, and bulging around their ears and electroreceptors; both are considered related to their dependency on olfactory and auditory perception. SPC-2191-1 do not appear to communicate via language, the only sound produced being a persistent grinding of the teeth – speculated to be both a form of echolocation and a way to sharpen their teeth to better suit their hunting needs.

SPC-2191-1 do not readily appear to undergo senescence, and have not aged since containment. Further analysis has revealed an abnormally slow metabolism. SPC-2191-1 instances are not believed to be biologically immortal[[footnote]] Such as the biological immortality of the //Turritopsis dohrnii//. [[/footnote]], but have a significantly decreased rate of necrosis.

SPC-2191-2 refers to a collective of vermiform organisms; these organisms vary in size, form, and purpose, and are accordingly classified as SPC-2191-2A, SPC-2191-2B, and SPC-2191-2C. Genetic analysis of SPC-2191-2 shows close relation with fellow subgroups, their most recent common ancestors being //Selachimorphas//. It has been speculated that SPC-2191-2 did not naturally evolve on its own, but its true origin remains unknown.

[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/spc-2191/SPC-2191-2A|caption=An instance of SPC-2191-2A which was found after the events of Addendum 2191.1.]]

SPC-2191-2A superficially resembles Nudibranchia (sea slug), but whose internal structure more closely resembles Hirudinea (leeches). Each SPC-2191-1 has an SPC-2191-2A instance within their abdomen, primarily located where the stomach and large/small intestines would exist. 

SPC-2191-2B is an infestation of vermiform organisms that live throughout the hollow walls of SPC-2191. SPC-2191 appears to have been constructed with a system of channels through which SPC-2191-2B travel, though it is unknown whether that was an intended feature. These thin, long organisms will enter SPC-2191-1 orifices (primarily via the mouth or rectum) but do not appear to cause harm or discomfort to their hosts. In fact, it appears that SPC-2191-1 instances cannot feel pain at all, whether that is due to a built-up immunity or lack of pain receptors. SPC-2191-2B is believed to redistribute nutrients throughout SPC-2191, extracted from any SPC-2191-1 which have recently been fed.

SPC-2191-2C, like SPC-2191-2B, inhabits the interior architecture of SPC-2191, specifically in the more collapsed wing. These tendril-like appendages are composed primarily of neurons and attach to SPC-2191-1 at the base of the spine while inactive. Only when attached to SPC-2191-2C does SPC-2191-1 display behavior resembling that of a sapient organism. SPC-2191-1 are considered inactive while connected to SPC-2191-2C, entering a state similar to tonic immobility, and becoming motionless.

During an active state, SPC-2191-1 entities will leave SPC-2191 and aggressively hunt for living humans - ignoring any non-human animals or deceased individuals. Active states do not occur simultaneously amongst SPC-2191-1 instances (although an active state will typically occur between dusk and dawn) nor do they hunt as a pack, choosing to spread throughout the coastal area near populated centers. A paralytic agent is employed to disable their prey, injected via venom-delivering barbs located both on their fins, and their teeth.

When prey has been successfully incapacitated, SPC-2191-1 will open its mouth and widen its throat, unhinging its jaw in the process. SPC-2191-2A will then emerge from SPC-2191-1&#39;s interior throat, initiating the feeding process by latching to the victim&#39;s neck via a toothed, funnel-like sucking mouth. SPC-2191-2A will first inject the body with digestive enzymes, liquidizing organs, muscles, and bones alike into a gelatinous liquid before consuming the resultant fluids. The process can last anywhere from 20 to 50 minutes, depending on the size of its victim.

Although known to those living in the vicinity of the area, SPC-2191 was not recognized by the Centre as a deviant until May 1968, after the unexplained disappearance of several beachgoers last seen at Saturn Beach. Eye witness testimonies reported seeing large selachian entities in the water, which attracted the Centre&#39;s attention. An investigation led to the discovery of a 2191-1 instance, which was tagged and followed to SPC-2191.

[[div class=&#34;marine-box&#34;]]

//Members of Marine Fighting Team Psi-9 (&#34;Trench Gazers&#34;): Ψ-One, Ψ-Two, Ψ-Three, Ψ-Four, and Ψ-Five were sent in to investigate SPC-2191. Each member was equipped with proper wet suits, body cameras, and flashlights.//

**Personnel Present:**
Ψ-One - James Burkley
Ψ-Two - Lisa Henderson
Ψ-Three - Johansson Persson
Ψ-Four - Stephen Myers
Ψ-Five - Séan O&#39;Leary

**Foreword**: The team is to explore SPC-2191, and to neutralize any possible selachian threats inside.
----
**Command:** Ok, you&#39;re T-minus 3 minutes away from the ruins. Get ready.

**Ψ-One:** Roger that.

**Ψ-Three:** So, what do you guys think is in there? Alien sharks? Demon sharks?

**Ψ-Two:** My money&#39;s on demon sharks. 

**Ψ-Four:** Man, why&#39;d we have to deal with demon sharks?

**Ψ-Five:** Because that&#39;s our job, Stephen. Besides, it could be worse. Did you guys hear about that rookie in Epsilon-7[[footnote]] Callsign: Forget Me Nauticals [[/footnote]] down in Barbados?

**Ψ-Three:** No, what happened?

**Ψ-Two:** Oh yeah, I heard about that. Had too many mnestics, and saw that the room was full of antimemetic selachian entities. The room was cleared, but the rookie went catatonic from shock. Never spoke again.

**Ψ-Five:** Yeah, poor guy. Hey, did you guys hear about Agent McCoy?

**Ψ-Three:** //laughs// Who hasn&#39;t? 

**Ψ-Four:** ...Me.

**Ψ-Three:** //clears throat// Oh, well Agent McCoy is in Omega-45[[footnote]] Callsign: Canal Cavalry [[/footnote]], and he and the rest of the team had to take down some sharks. But, here&#39;s the kicker: They had legs.

**Ψ-Four:** No fucking way.

**Ψ-Three:** Yep. Well, they knocked their lights out and followed a lead on a person of interest. The POI went by the name of Polaris. The Cavalry went to their place, and you wanna know what that sick fuck had in their apartment? A fucking Blåhaj.

//The whole room boos with emphasis at the mere mention of the word Blåhaj.//

**Ψ-Two:** Fucking digusting.

**Ψ-Three:** Well, Agent McCoy looks that son of a bitch in the eye, and clocks it like he&#39;s Floyd motherfucking Mayweather!

//The whole room erupts with laughter, except for Ψ-One, who continues to stay silent.//

**Ψ-Three:** Hey James, why the long face?

**Ψ-One:** I don&#39;t see what&#39;s so funny.

**Ψ-Three:** //mumurs something under his breath//

**Ψ-One:** I&#39;m sorry Johansson, but do you have something to say?

**Ψ-Three:** No, nothing...

**Ψ-One:** Well, in that case, allow me to say something. To all of you: This is not a game. Stay focused, stay pugilistic, and get the job done. Even a second of weakness and those sharks will tear you limb from limb.

**Ψ-Two:** Let me guess, you&#39;re saying it as our friend, not our captain?

//Ψ-One turns to face everyone, showing a large scar lining their face and upper torso.//

**Ψ-One:** No, I&#39;m saying it from experience.

//Silence fills the room, before the speaker above whirs to life.//

**Command:** Alright, you&#39;re about to reach the building. Put on your wetsuits, and go out through the hatch. On your way to the hatch, grab one of the many water propulsion devices hanging on the wall. They&#39;ll help you move around faster without you having to swim much, and you can use that leftover energy to punch any sharks you see right in the kisser. Remember, the green button on the handle makes it move, so letting go of the button will cause the device to slowly come to a halt. The red one will activate the self-destruct sequence, which has a 3-second delay. We&#39;ll still be able to communicate via the coms but the walls of the building may mess with the signal. Good luck out there.

**Ψ-Four:** Fucking self-destruct button? Shit man, this is serious.

**Ψ-Three:** Do your best not to wet yourself, Stephen. 

**Ψ-Four:** //sarcastically// Haha, very funny Johansson.

**Ψ-One:** Alright, let&#39;s move!

//The team puts on their suits, grabs their propulsion devices, and step outside the hatch and are now in open water, with SPC-2191 visible ahead. The team use their propulsion devices to glide over to the wreckage.//

**Ψ-One:** Ok, everyone be ready for anything. We don&#39;t know what&#39;s in there, so stay alert, and get ready to defend yourself.

//The team enters SPC-2191, their suit&#39;s headlights illuminating the walls, revealing the pro-Selachian located all over the walls.//

**Ψ-Four:** These sick bastards must&#39;ve worshipped some kind of shark god.

**Ψ-Two:** Please, never say the words god and shark in the same sentence. 

**Command:** //&lt;inaudible&gt;// -&#39;re getting some distortion on our end. //&lt;inaudible&gt;// -ossible movement detected o- //&lt;inaudible&gt;//

//At this point, the audio cuts out.//

**Ψ-One:** Command! Command, do you copy? Come in, damnit! Damn, looks like we&#39;re on our own.

**Ψ-Four:** Oh no, fuck this man! This place has some freaky vibes! I&#39;m out of here!

//Ψ-Four turns around, and begins to head towards the direction they came from. He then goes out of view.//

**Ψ-Two:** Stephen, get your ass back here!

//There is zero response heard from Ψ-Four.//

**Ψ-One:** Forget it, Lisa. He&#39;s probably back at the sub already. Let&#39;s just keep going.

//The team continues to go further into the ruins, making visual contact with an exposed SPC-2191-2B instance.//

**Ψ-Three:** What the hell...

**Ψ-Five:** Seems to be some kind of network. They&#39;re coming from that hallway down there.

//The team begins to follow the exposed network of SPC-2191-2B down a dark hallway. The trail of SPC-2191-2B instances ends, but the group continues forward. The team stops when Ψ-One signals everyone to stop. He then puts his finger up to his mouth, and points. The headlights of the group&#39;s suits reveal several immobile SPC-2191-1 connected to SPC-2191-2C.//

**Ψ-One:** Everyone, move very slowly. It looks like they&#39;re asleep or something, so don&#39;t wake them up. 

**Ψ-Two:** Jesus, they&#39;re like vampires, like fucking Dracula. Heh, maybe even a &#34;Sharkula&#34; eh?

//There is no response heard from everyone.//

**Ψ-Two:** Damn, tough crowd.

//A low humming sound is heard coming from behind the group. Ψ-Three turns and faces the direction, raising his fists in preparation. Instead of a shark, a water propulsion device floats towards them, with the motor on it slowly coming to a halt. A large part of the device is covered in blood.//

**Ψ-Three:** Is that... 

**Ψ-Four:** Oh god, Stephen...

**Ψ-Two:** Oh fuck...

//Ψ-Two slowly starts swimming away from the device, accidentally bumping into one of the SPC-2191-2C tentacles, which wakes up a nearby SPC-2191-1 instance.//

**Ψ-One:** Lisa, behind you!

//Ψ-Two turns to see the SPC-2191-1 instance charging towards her. She immediately cracks her knuckles and puts her fists up.//

**Ψ-Two:** Alright, let&#39;s rumble spooky!

//Ψ-Two throws a left hook at the shark, which connects, but it does not react. The shark then bites Ψ-Two&#39;s arm clean off, causing her to scream in pain, and the surrounding water to turn red. The shark then takes another bite, this time out of her side, which seems to paralyze her. The shark then opens its jaw, showing the SPC-2191-2A instance inside of it, which begins to feast upon Ψ-Two.//

**Ψ-One:** Everybody move! We need to leave NOW!

//The rest of the group begins to move towards the exit as fast as they can as more SPC-2191-1 instances awake and begin pursuing them. The 2191-1 instances quickly began closing the distance between them and the group, with one instance being able to bite Ψ-Five&#39;s leg, instantly paralyzing him, and his body being dragged further into the ruins.//

//While Ψ-Three continues to swim away, Ψ-One stops. Noticing this, Ψ-Three yells at Ψ-One.//

**Ψ-Three:** James, are you fucking crazy?! We need to go!

**Ψ-One:** //pauses before saying// Don&#39;t follow me.

**Ψ-Three:** What?

**Ψ-One:** I need to make sure those fucks don&#39;t get out and attack the sub, or anybody else. 

**Ψ-Three:** I&#39;m not fucking leaving you here!

**Ψ-One:** Go! That&#39;s an order!

//Ψ-One then uses his propulsion device and heads toward the SPC-2191-1 instances, before pressing the red button and closing his eyes. Almost instantly, the device explodes, killing Ψ-One and the pursuing entities. The resulting shockwave causes parts of the ruins to collapse, sealing the exit.//

//After the explosion, the microphone, and camera quality have been heavily distorted. Ψ-Three can be heard hyperventilating while frantically looking for an exit. After an extraneous time searching, Ψ-Three appears to enter some kind of inner sanctum. Ψ-Three&#39;s oxygen levels are low, and his movements are erratic. The camera pans over to some kind of gelatinous substance against one of the chamber walls, which seems to be eating away at it. Ψ-Three then begins to travel deep into the inner sanctum, with root-like appendages visible everywhere. Suddenly, Ψ-Three stops moving, looking at something off-screen. With a shaky voice, Ψ-Three spoke.//

**Ψ-Three:** Oh my god... I-It&#39;s massive...

//The feed begins to suffer even more distortions, with the remaining feed being a jumble of heavy breathing cutting in and out, with the low oxygen alert being audibly heard before the feed cuts out. Multiple dead SPC-2191-1 instances were found nearby, most likely dying after the subsequent explosion. Mr. Burkley will be given posthumous awards for their bravery in the line of duty, and sacrifice.//

//It is believed that Ψ-Three died from a lack of oxygen, and it was initially believed that the organism Ψ-Three saw was the result of hallucinating. However, Addendum 2191.2 says otherwise, with this new entity being designated SPC-2191-3. See Addendum 2191.2: Interview Log for more details.//

**Sarah:** Thank you for your time, Mr. Costache. This won&#39;t take long.

**Andrei:** //lights cigarette// It better not...[[footnote]] Mr. Costache only speaks Romanian, making Ms. Fischer an ideal interviewer due to her fluency in speaking Romanian. The remainder of this interview has been translated into English from Romanian.[[/footnote]]

**Sarah:** Very well. So, Mr. Costache, how long have you lived in Mangalia?

**Andrei:** My whole life.

**Sarah:** And you would say you&#39;re very knowledgeable about the ongoings of the town?

**Andrei:** Yes, I would say so.

**Sarah:** So, has there been anything odd happening lately? Missing people, supernatural occurrences, anything like that?

**Andrei:** Are you crazy? Of course not!

**Sarah:** Mr. Costache, I am to remind you that you just said you knew the ongoings of the town, meaning there should be nothing you wouldn&#39;t know about, right?

**Andrei:** I don&#39;t see the point of these questions, lady. I don&#39;t-

**Sarah:** Answer the question, Mr. Costache.

**Andrei:** I... yeah.

**Sarah:** //leans in close// So what is the sunken temple? 

**Andrei:** S-sunken temple? I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about...

**Sarah:** The sunken temple is located in the ocean off the coast of this very town. You were sighted along with several others encouraging tourists to swim at Saturn Beach. The people who went there were never seen again.

**Andrei:** ...

**Sarah:** Let me explain something: We are not the local authorities. You know that since I assume they&#39;re in on it. We have no code, so please, be our guest, and don&#39;t talk. How is your wife, Mr. Costache?

**Andrei:** ...what do you want to know?

**Sarah:** Everything.

**Andrei:** It&#39;s where she resides...

**Sarah:** Who is she?

**Andrei:** Mother. She sends her kin to provide sustenance, and we help them feast. It is our purpose.

**Sarah:** Mother?

**Andrei:** Once the fairest and most beautiful shark. An Angel amongst mortals. The tides would shift just to be with her, and her with them. The great Calypso, angered by her power, and jealous of her, sought her downfall. She went to Poseidon, who cast her to the darkest depths. From there, something called out to her. A leviathan of the deep, older than the tide itself. Something born from the World Ocean[[footnote]] A primordial ocean dating before creation, and a common part of Romanian folklore. [[/footnote]]. It promised her revenge against Poseidon, and she accepted. It changed her and made her more powerful than one could ever dream. Power to shake the world and make it quake with fear.

She planted herself amongst the reefs and bore her spawn, which could rule over the sea. We must appease them, or suffer their wrath. Poseidon now weeps for the pain he has caused, and Calypso was banished from ever returning to the sea. The Mother now rules the depths, as is her claim. 

The world is her oyster, and we are nothing to stop her.

**[END LOG]**
[[/=]]

[[/div]]

From the information gathered, the existence of SPC-2191-3 has been all but confirmed. From the knowledge gathered, it can be deduced that:
* SPC-2191-3 is located at the center of the inner sanctum inside SPC-2191.
* SPC-2191-3 creates the tunnels that are present throughout SPC-2191 using a corrosive substance it can secrete.
* SPC-2191-3 is sapient.
* It is proposed that SPC-2191-3 exerts control over SPC-2191-1 and SPC-2191-2 organisms via physical interaction with SPC-2191-2C, and through the release of complex pheromones.
* The SPC-2191-1 instances are sent out to feed SPC-2191-3.
* The locals worship SPC-2191-3 as some kind of deific selachian entity[[footnote]]A “shark god” as Ψ-Four called it.[[/footnote]] and actively work to provide it human victims by either tricking or forcing locals to go to SPC-2191-1 hotspots and be subsequently taken.
* SPC-2191-3 seems to be able to cause seaquakes, which acts as a motive for the locals to provide it sustenance in order to appease it.

**A STATEMENT FROM ORACLE**
[[/=]]

&gt; There are some who believe that the Centre has never, nor will ever, be unable to punch a shark. Our efforts to contain SPC-2191 have only led to the death of our agents, with disinformation campaigns still not stopping people from coming to Mangalia. It even appears that our efforts have done nothing but encourage the locals for all these years. 
&gt;         
&gt; The obvious choice would be to handle it in a non-pugilistic way.
&gt;     
&gt; And we&#39;ve considered. Run down every alley, investigate every lead, and theorize all possible ways to put SPC-2191 in the ground for good. If these proposed ways were ever tried, it would lead to countless deaths.
&gt;            
&gt; In order to handle this threat, we must allow it to continue unhindered. We understand any outrage that one would be feeling at the mere notion of this. This is not the first, nor will even be close to the last where the Centre must make a choice. This choice, good or bad, will inevitably lead to deaths. In the end, it is a necessary sacrifice.
&gt;               
&gt; We are aware that every death only empowers SPC-2191-3.
&gt;    
&gt; We may not be able to now, but we are the Shark Punching Centre, and we will punch these goddamn sharks no matter the cost.
