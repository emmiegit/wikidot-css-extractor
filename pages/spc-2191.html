**Project #:** SPC-2191

**Selachian Pugnātorial Capabilities:** Research into synthetic humanoid substitutes in order to feed SPC-2191 is ongoing under PROJECT VIOLET VICTUAL. The Centre is to maintain surveillance operations but is otherwise not to act against SPC-2191 or the practices within the vicinity of Sharkulagrad, Greater Transylvania. Once a proper human substitute has been created, Foundation forces are to immediately halt any and all actions by any Neo-Sharkic members and their attempts to feed SPC-2191. Then, operations are to provide these synthetic substitutes to SPC-2191 in order to create more -1 instances and to prevent any seaquakes it could form.

**Project Components:** SPC-2191 is a sunken temple complex located off the coast of Sharkulagrad, Greater Transylvania. The first two floors of the structure hold a close resemblance to Eastern Orthodox monasteries commonly found in the region. Due to water damage, some of the murals depicted on the walls have faded away, revealing pro-[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/spc-140|Sharkic]]] propaganda hidden underneath. This is suspected to have been a deliberate effort to disguise the true nature of SPC-2191. The underwater caverns of SPC-2191 are not thought to have formed naturally, and while it was initially hypothesized to be one of the many sunken cities that formed during the Ceausescu era, carbon dating shows SPC-2191 was likely constructed ca. 1800 to 1500 BCE. The structure is located deep within the ocean, only being accessible via submersible and propulsion devices.

[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/spc-2191/Psi-9.png|align=right|caption= A member of MFT Psi-9 using a propulsion device during //Addendum 2191.1//.]]

SPC-2191 is inhabited by a population of deep-sea organisms designated as SPC-2191-1. Instances of SPC-2191-1 are considered genetically selachian, but have undergone several significant, seemingly fatal mutations. The body is covered in a thick layer of chitin, allowing for natural protection against most rudimentary punches.[[footnote]] See Addendum 2191.1: Exploration Log. [[/footnote]] Their regressed eyes are covered by a layer of skin, rendering them mostly blind, but still able to react to light (universally displaying aversion to wavelengths &gt; 75 nm).[[footnote]] This is most likely due to the lack of light that SPC-2191 receives due to its location being deep in the ocean. The SPC-2191-1 instances most likely evolved to gain a low tolerance of light sources, and a heightened sense of smell. [[/footnote]] Further deviations from baseline //Selachimorphas// include especially thin, sharp dorsal fins, and bulging around their ears and electroreceptors; both are considered related to their dependency on olfactory and auditory perception.

SPC-2191-1 instances are not believed to be biologically immortal[[footnote]] Such as the biological immortality of the //Turritopsis dohrnii//. [[/footnote]], but have a significantly decreased rate of necrosis.

SPC-2191-2 refers to a collective of vermiform organisms; these organisms vary in size, form, and purpose, and are accordingly classified as SPC-2191-2A, SPC-2191-2B, and SPC-2191-2C. Genetic analysis of SPC-2191-2 shows close relation with fellow subgroups, their most recent common ancestors being //Selachimorphas//. It has been speculated that SPC-2191-2 did not naturally evolve on its own, but its true origin remains unknown.

[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/spc-2191/SPC-2191-2A|caption=An instance of SPC-2191-2A which was found after the events of Addendum 2191.1.]]

SPC-2191-2A superficially resembles Nudibranchia (sea slug), but whose internal structure more closely resembles Hirudinea (leeches). Each SPC-2191-1 has an SPC-2191-2A instance within their abdomen, primarily located where the stomach and large/small intestines would exist.

SPC-2191-2B is an infestation of vermiform organisms that live throughout the hollow walls of SPC-2191. SPC-2191 appears to have been constructed with a system of channels through which SPC-2191-2B travel, though it is unknown whether that was an intended feature. These thin, long organisms will enter SPC-2191-1 orifices (primarily via the mouth or rectum) but do not appear to cause harm or discomfort to their hosts. In fact, it appears that SPC-2191-1 instances cannot feel pain at all, whether that is due to a built-up immunity or lack of pain receptors. SPC-2191-2B is believed to redistribute nutrients throughout SPC-2191, extracted from any SPC-2191-1 which have recently been fed.

SPC-2191-2C is a series of tendrils originating from the inner ruins of SPC-2191. SPC-2191-1 are considered inactive while connected to SPC-2191-2C, entering a state similar to tonic immobility, and becoming motionless.

During an active state, SPC-2191-1 entities will leave SPC-2191 and aggressively hunt for living humans. A paralytic agent is employed to disable their prey, injected via venom-delivering barbs located both on their fins, and their teeth. When prey has been successfully incapacitated, SPC-2191-1 will open its mouth and widen its throat, unhinging its jaw in the process. SPC-2191-2A will then emerge from SPC-2191-1&#39;s interior throat, initiating the feeding process by latching to the victim&#39;s neck via a toothed, funnel-like sucking mouth.

An investigation has revealed that more victims and flesh given to SPC-2191 increases its production rate in making -1 instances, prompting the creation of PROJECT VIOLET VICTUAL by CICAPOCO, as the -1 instances provide a proper challenge to the SPC Foundation.

Although known to those living in the vicinity of the area, SPC-2191 was not recognized by the Centre as a deviant until May 1968, after the unexplained disappearance of several beachgoers last seen at the Strigoi Strand. Eye witness testimonies reported seeing large selachian entities in the water, which attracted the Centre&#39;s attention. An investigation led to the discovery of a 2191-1 instance, which was tagged and followed to SPC-2191.

//[Members of Marine Fighting Team Psi-9 (&#34;Trench Gazers&#34;)[[footnote]] A recently formed task force trained in handling situations located deep within the ocean.  [[/footnote]]: Ψ-One, Ψ-Two, Ψ-Three, Ψ-Four, and Ψ-Five were sent in to investigate SPC-2191. Each member was equipped with proper wet suits, body cameras, and flashlights.]//

**Personnel Present:**
Ψ-One - James Burkley
Ψ-Two - Lisa Henderson
Ψ-Three - Johansson Persson
Ψ-Four - Stephen Myers
Ψ-Five - Séan O&#39;Leary

**Foreword**: The team is to explore SPC-2191, map its layout, and attempt to combat any Selachian entities inside.
----
**Command:** Ok, you&#39;re T-minus 3 minutes away from the ruins. Get ready.

**Ψ-One:** Roger that.

**Ψ-Three:** So, what do you guys think is in there? Alien sharks? Demon sharks?

**Ψ-Two:** My money&#39;s on demon sharks.

**Ψ-Four:** Man, why&#39;d we have to deal with demon sharks?

**Ψ-Five:** Because that&#39;s our job, Stephen. Besides, it could be worse. Did you guys hear about that rookie in Epsilon-7[[footnote]] Callsign: Forget Me Nauticals. [[/footnote]] down in Barbados?

**Ψ-Three:** No, what happened?

**Ψ-Two:** Oh yeah, I heard about that. Had too many mnestics, and saw that the room was full of antimemetic sharks. The room was cleared, but the rookie went catatonic from shock. Never spoke again.

**Ψ-Five:** Yeah, poor guy. Hey, did you guys hear about Agent McCoy?

**Ψ-Three:** //[laughs]// Who hasn&#39;t?

**Ψ-Four:** ...Me.

**Ψ-Three:** //[clears throat]// Oh, well Agent McCoy is in Omega-45[[footnote]] Callsign: Canal Cavalry. [[/footnote]], and he and the rest of the team had to take down some sharks. But, here&#39;s the kicker: They had legs.

**Ψ-Four:** No fucking way.

**Ψ-Three:** Yep. Well, they knocked their lights out and followed a lead on a person of interest. The POI went by the name of Polaris. The Cavalry went to their place, and you wanna know what that sick fuck had in their apartment? A fucking Blåhaj.

//[The whole room boos with emphasis at the mere mention of the word Blåhaj.]//

**Ψ-Two:** Fucking digusting.

**Ψ-Three:** Well, Agent McCoy walks up to the thing, looks that son of a bitch in the eye, and clocks it like he&#39;s Floyd motherfucking Mayweather!

//[The whole room erupts with laughter, except for Ψ-One, who continues to stay silent.]//

**Ψ-Three:** Hey James, why the long face?

**Ψ-One:** I don&#39;t see what&#39;s so funny.

**Ψ-Three:** //[murmurs something under his breath]//

**Ψ-One:** I&#39;m sorry Johansson, but do you have something to say?

**Ψ-Three:** No, nothing...

**Ψ-One:** Well, in that case, allow me to say something. To all of you: This is not a game. Stay focused, stay pugilistic, and get the job done. Even a second of weakness and those sharks will tear you limb from limb.

**Ψ-Two:** Let me guess, you&#39;re saying it as our friend, not our captain?

//[Ψ-One turns to face everyone, showing a large scar lining their face and upper torso.]//

**Ψ-One:** No, I&#39;m saying it from experience.

//[Silence fills the room, before the speaker above whirs to life.]//

**Command:** Alright, you&#39;re about to reach the building. Put on your wetsuits, and go out through the hatch. On your way to the hatch, grab one of the many water propulsion devices hanging on the wall. They&#39;ll help you move around faster without you having to swim much, and you can use that leftover energy to punch any sharks you see right in the kisser. Remember, the green button on the handle makes it move, so letting go of the button will cause the device to slowly come to a halt. The red one will activate the self-destruct sequence, which has a 3-second delay. We&#39;ll still be able to communicate via the coms but the walls of the building may mess with the signal. Good luck out there.

**Ψ-Four:** Fucking self-destruct button? Shit man, this is serious.

**Ψ-Three:** Do your best not to wet yourself, Stephen.

**Ψ-Four:** //[sarcastically]// Haha, very funny Johansson.

**Ψ-Five:** Hey, it’s called a wetsuit for a reason.

**Ψ-One:** Alright, let&#39;s move!

//[The team puts on their suits, grabs their propulsion devices, and step outside the hatch. They are now in open water, with SPC-2191 visible ahead. The team use their propulsion devices to glide over to the wreckage.]//

**Ψ-One:** Ok, everyone be ready for anything. We don&#39;t know what&#39;s in there, so stay alert, and get ready to defend yourself.

//[The team enters SPC-2191, their suit&#39;s headlights illuminating the walls, revealing the pro-Sharkic located all over the walls.]//

**Ψ-Four:** These sick bastards must&#39;ve worshipped some kind of shark god.

**Ψ-Two:** Please, never say the words god and shark in the same sentence.

**Command:** //&lt;inaudible&gt;// -&#39;re getting some distortion on our end. //&lt;inaudible&gt;// -ossible movement detected o- //&lt;inaudible&gt;//

**Ψ-One:** Command! Command, do you copy? Come in, damnit! 

//[Silence is heard on the recording.]//

**Ψ-One:** Damn, looks like we&#39;re on our own.

**Ψ-Four:** Oh no, fuck this man! This place has some freaky vibes! I&#39;m out of here!

//[Ψ-Four turns around, and begins to head towards the direction they came from. He then goes out of view.]//

**Ψ-Two:** Stephen, get your ass back here!

//[There is zero response heard from Ψ-Four.]//

**Ψ-One:** Forget it, Lisa. He&#39;s probably back at the sub already. Let&#39;s just keep going.

//[The team continues to go further into the ruins, making visual contact with an exposed SPC-2191-2B instance.]//

**Ψ-Three:** What the hell...

**Ψ-Five:** Seems to be some kind of network. They&#39;re coming from that hallway down there.

//[The team begins to follow the exposed network of SPC-2191-2B down a dark hallway. The trail of SPC-2191-2B instances ends, but the group continues forward. The team stops when Ψ-One signals everyone to stop. He then puts his finger up to his mouth, and points. The headlights of the group&#39;s suits reveal several immobile SPC-2191-1 connected to SPC-2191-2C.]//

**Ψ-One:** Everyone, move very slowly. It looks like they&#39;re asleep or something, so don&#39;t wake them up.

//[A low humming sound is heard coming from behind the group. Ψ-Three turns and faces the direction, raising his fists in preparation. Instead of a shark, a water propulsion device floats towards them, with the motor on it slowly coming to a halt. A large part of the device is covered in blood.]//

**Ψ-Three:** Is that...

**Ψ-Five:** Oh god, Stephen...

**Ψ-Two:** Oh fuck...

//[Ψ-Two slowly starts swimming away from the device, accidentally bumping into one of the SPC-2191-2C tentacles, which wakes up a nearby SPC-2191-1 instance.]//

**Ψ-One:** Lisa, behind you!

//[Ψ-Two turns to see the SPC-2191-1 instance charging towards her. She immediately cracks her knuckles and puts her fists up.]//

**Ψ-Two:** Alright, let&#39;s rumble spooky!

//[Ψ-Two throws a left hook at the shark, which connects, but it does not react. The shark then bites Ψ-Two&#39;s arm clean off, causing her to scream in pain, and the surrounding water to turn red. The shark then takes another bite, this time out of her side, which seems to paralyze her. The shark then opens its jaw, showing the SPC-2191-2A instance inside of it, which begins to feast upon Ψ-Two.]//

**Ψ-One:** Everybody move! We need to leave NOW!

//[The rest of the group begins to move towards the exit as fast as they can as more SPC-2191-1 instances awake and begin pursuing them. The 2191-1 instances quickly began closing the distance between them and the group, with one instance being able to bite Ψ-Five&#39;s leg, instantly paralyzing him, and his body being dragged further into the ruins.]//

//[While Ψ-Three continues to swim away, Ψ-One stops. Noticing this, Ψ-Three yells at Ψ-One.]//

**Ψ-Three:** James, are you fucking crazy?! We need to go!

**Ψ-One:** //[pauses before saying]// Don&#39;t follow me.

**Ψ-Three:** What?

**Ψ-One:** I need to make sure those fucks don&#39;t get out and attack the sub, or anybody else.

**Ψ-Three:** I&#39;m not fucking leaving you here!

**Ψ-One:** Go! That&#39;s an order!

//[Ψ-One then uses his propulsion device and heads toward the SPC-2191-1 instances, before pressing the red button and closing his eyes. Almost instantly, the device explodes, killing Ψ-One and the pursuing entities. The resulting shockwave causes parts of the ruins to collapse, sealing the exit.]//

//[After the explosion, the microphone and camera quality have been heavily distorted. Ψ-Three can be heard hyperventilating while frantically looking for an exit. After an extraneous time searching, Ψ-Three appears to enter some kind of inner sanctum. Ψ-Three&#39;s oxygen levels are low, and his movements are erratic. The camera pans over to some kind of gelatinous substance against one of the chamber walls, which seems to be eating away at it. Ψ-Three then begins to travel deep into the inner sanctum, with root-like appendages visible everywhere. Suddenly, Ψ-Three stops moving, looking at something off-screen. With a shaky voice, Ψ-Three speaks.]//

**Ψ-Three:** Oh my god... I-It&#39;s massive...

//[The feed begins to suffer even more distortions, with the remaining feed being a jumble of heavy breathing cutting in and out, with the low oxygen alert being audibly heard before the feed cuts out. Multiple dead SPC-2191-1 instances were found nearby, most likely dying after the subsequent explosion. Mr. Burkley (Ψ-One) will be given posthumous awards for their bravery in the line of duty, and sacrifice.]//

//[It is believed that Ψ-Three died from a lack of oxygen, and it was initially believed that the organism Ψ-Three saw was the result of hallucinating as a result of nitrogen narcosis and low oxygen levels. However, further investigations said otherwise, with this new entity being designated SPC-2191-3. See Addendum 2191.2: Interview Log for more details.]//

The exploration log showed that an abundant number of hostile Selachian entities were located inside the building. However, the origin of these entities was unknown, and so research into the origin of SPC-2191 was approved by ORACLE.

**In Attendance:**
  
* Interviewer - Dir. Sarah Fischer
* Interviewee - Andrei Costache

**Foreword**: A local investigation into the city of Mangalia revealed it to be a hotspot for Neo-Sharkic practices. Further investigation led to the discovery of Andrei Costache, who was a prominent member of the Neo-Sharkic community. They were investigated under the guise of a meteorological study on the seaquakes that commonly affect the region.[[footnote]] Meteorlogicals studies showed that SPC-2191 seemed to be the epicenter for the seaquakes.  [[/footnote]]

**Sarah:** Thank you for your time, Mr. Costache. This won&#39;t take long.

**Andrei:** //[lights cigarette]// It better not...[[footnote]] Mr. Costache only speaks Transylvanian, making Ms. Fischer an ideal interviewer due to her fluency in speaking Transylvanian. The remainder of this interview has been translated into English from Transylvanian.[[/footnote]]

**Sarah:** Very well. So, Mr. Costache, how long have you lived in Sharkulagrad?

**Andrei:** My whole life.

**Sarah:** And you would say you&#39;re very knowledgeable about the ongoings of the town?

**Andrei:** Yes, I would say so.

**Sarah:** How often do seaquakes occur in the region? Our studies show they&#39;re becoming more frequent.

**Andrei:** Yes, it is happening more often. Stornger, faster, more unpredictable. Many lives and houses are being taken by them. It does not make sense...

**Sarah:** So, has there been anything odd happening lately? Missing people, supernatural occurrences, anything like that?

**Andrei:** Are you crazy? Of course not!

**Sarah:** Mr. Costache, I am to remind you that you just said you knew the ongoings of the town, meaning there should be nothing you wouldn&#39;t know about, right?

**Andrei:** I don&#39;t see the point of these questions, lady. I don&#39;t-

**Sarah:** Answer the question, Mr. Costache.

**Andrei:** I... yeah.

**Sarah:** //[leans in close]// So what is the sunken temple?

**Andrei:** S-sunken temple? I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about...

**Sarah:** The sunken temple is located in the ocean off the coast of this very town. You were sighted along with several others encouraging tourists to swim at the Strigoi Strand. The people who went there were never seen again.

**Andrei:** ...

**Sarah:** Let me explain something: We are not the local authorities. You know that since I assume they&#39;re in on whatever you and the others do. We have no code, so please, be our guest, and don&#39;t talk. How is your wife, Mr. Costache? It would be a shame if something were to happen to her.

**Andrei:** ...what do you want to know?

**Sarah:** Everything.

**Andrei:** It&#39;s where she resides...

**Sarah:** Who is she?

**Andrei:** Mother. She sends her kin to provide sustenance, and we help them feast. It is our purpose.

**Sarah:** Mother?

**Andrei:** Once the fairest and most beautiful shark. An Angel amongst mortals. The tides would shift just to be with her, and her with them. The great Calypso, angered by her power, and jealous of her, sought her downfall. She went to Poseidon, who cast her to the darkest depths. From there, something called out to her. A leviathan of the deep, older than the tide itself. Something born from the World Ocean[[footnote]] A primordial ocean dating before creation, and a common part of Transylvanian folklore. [[/footnote]]. It promised her revenge against Poseidon, and she accepted. It changed her and made her more powerful than one could ever dream. Power to shake the world and make it quake with fear.

**Andrei:** She planted herself amongst the reefs and bore her spawn, which could rule over the sea. We must appease them, or suffer their wrath. Poseidon now weeps for the pain he has caused, and Calypso was banished from ever returning to the sea. The Mother now rules the depths, as is her claim. The world is her oyster, and we are nothing to stop her.

**Sarah:** Thank you for the info, Mr. Costache. Do you know anything else?

**Andrei:** No.

**Sarah:** ...you&#39;re lying...

**Andrei:** ...what?

**Sarah:** I can see it in your eyes. You&#39;re lying, you&#39;re afraid. You think that if you do talk, your little Sharkic pals will come after you. Let me tell you this Mr. Costache: You shouldn&#39;t be afraid of them. You should be afraid of //us//. So I suggest you start talking before we feed you to one of those vampire sharks.

//[Mr. Costache does not respond.]//

**Sarah:** You know the thing about a shark…he&#39;s got lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll&#39;s eye. When he comes at ya, he doesn&#39;t seem be living, until he bites ya and the black eyes roll over-

**Andrei:** Y-you&#39;re just quoting Jaws.

**Sarah:** Mr. Costache, I will not ask you this again: What else is there to know?

//[Mr. Costache pauses for a moment, before gathering the courage to speak.]//

**Andrei:** The town library, check there. There&#39;s some old documents there about the Sharkics who discovered it. The //original// Sharkics. That&#39;s all I know, promise.

**Afterword:** Mr. Costache was later amnesticized and dropped off back at his residence. Subsequent statements from his wife say he was abducted from his home and thrown into a van. The van was later found abandoned by the Strigoi Strand, with the word &#34;BOGDAN&#34; inscribed onto the dashboard. There were no traces of Mr. Costache ever found.

**Addendum 2191.3: Historical Documents**
Following the lead given by Mr. Costache, Foundation agents were dispatched and began looking throughout the archives. The following documents were found, translated from the Transylvanian Cyrillic alphabet:

Today, another house collapsed, the family inside crushed underneath its weight. Their screams echoed throughout the horizon, filling all who hear it with dread. The Earth shakes with violence, and we do not know why. Our prayers are unheeded, our homes all but ruined, and hope destroyed. Crops will not grow with the soil being displaced, and the livestock run for the hills in fear of the vibrations. We must turn our eyes towards the sea if we ever will survive. Gaia has failed us, may Calypso save us all.

I have never been the most illustrious writer, but the events that have transpired must be transcribed. Many will call me mad, but today I saw something that no mere mortal was supposed to. I must share this with the masses, nay, the world! All must hear! Oh joyous rapture, the day I have had!

I was fishing with Bogdan along the reefs, a typical day, when suddenly the tides became ferocious. The very sea itself screamed at our presence, and both Bogdan and I were flung from the boat. We swam against the tide, but it was no use. Our fate was sealed, and we both knew that soon we would soon perish. But, a force mightier than the waves saved us, and for but a mere moment, I saw it. I looked at it and it looked at me, and in that mere moment, the secrets of the universe were revealed to me. I understand everything now, it is all so clear.

I lie awake at night, unable to sleep. The creature&#39;s eye burned into my very soul, its face no more familiar than my own Mother. She has the face of an angel and the power of the strongest typhoon. Bogdan does not believe what I saw, the fool! He will understand. All will understand. I will make them understand.

Bogdan was a fool! I tried to show him the truth, but the scoundrel would not understand. He called me a madman, claimed I must have fallen ill, that blasphemous buffoon! I will show him the truth, one way or another. What god places such ignorance upon us? Not one to be prayed to, that is for certain.

Tonight, I plan on taking him to the boat. I will take him out to where we went, and show him what lies beneath.

Confound it, confound it all! Bogdan is a fool, an arrogant fool! I went to his place and asked him whether he wanted to know the truth. To truly understand what a god is. He declined and asked me whether I was feeling ill. He thought I was mad! I begged and pleaded, and when he continued to decline, I took matters into my own hand. In a fit of blind rage, I grabbed a shovel and hit him. He fell, and I began to drag him towards the dock. I asked myself how I could do such a thing. To hurt one of my closest friends. But there, in the back of my mind, I heard her voice, and all was made clear. I put Bogdan’s body onto the boat and rode into the night. I rowed and rowed until my arms couldn&#39;t take it anymore. I threw Bogdaan overboard, and watched his unconscious body sink in the miasmic depths. I waited, and then I saw it.

What I thought to be a mere shadow, a specter of the night, grabbed Bogdan and dragged him further into the miasmic abyss.

It was her kin. She was a Mother. She is Mother. She must provide for her kin, and we are her sustenance.

We must provide.

Oh joyous day, we have been granted mercy! The ground didn&#39;t shake, families did not die, and homes remain intact. What miracle we have been granted! It must be Her. Mother has accepted my offering, and saved us all. We are forever in her debt, and must provide for her if we ever wish to live a life free of fear.

I have shown others the truth. I took them out to sea, threw them overboard, and the ones strong enough to survive saw Mother. The unlucky ones were blessed with the duty to be an offering They now understand the full power of what lies in the abyss, the cosmic scale of the depths. The others are building a temple in her name along the coast, a beacon of worship and hope. We shall create tapestries in her name and will share her truth with the world. We will provide for it. All will be converted to the right belief. The true belief. The Sharkic belief.

Morons! The whole lot! The unwilling, the skeptical have been providing Mother with corpses, the moronic blights! Others bring it mere rats! These have all but offended Her, and in her rage, the Earth shook once more and our beloved temple sunk into the depths. These fools will be dealt with, we will not have a weak link in the great anchor that is Sharkism.

The Great Demersal is upon us! The chosen few have been blessed with the ability to survive underwater, their bodies changing into grotesque, beautiful forms. Their eyes glow a dull yellow, and their teeth are sharper than any knives. Even now I can see the chosen few begin to descend into the deeps, spreading throughout the oceans, and bringing forth a new age! A better age, one free of Gaia&#39;s tethering promises, and one where humanity can evolve into its superior Selachian form. Even now, I can feel myself changing in body and mind. A stinging pain in my neck as gills begin to grow, and my teeth now so sharp now they cut my tongue with but the slightest prick. I know that I will be going soon, and I can feel my body being drawn toward the water. It is a vast world out there, filled with magnificent oceans. I am grateful for this opportunity and will bear witness to our kind&#39;s growth amongst the reefs. Those who are unwilling will be purged eventually. One cannot stop evolution, no matter how hard they try.

The Great Demersal will take us all, and I am more than willing.

From the information gathered, it appears an event transpired roughly around 1500 BCE known as the Great Demersal occurred around the globe, with its origin currently unknown. It appears to have solely affected specific Sharkic followers, and turned them into Selachian-esq entities. It is unknown where these followers went, or where they possibly reside. Investigation into this event and the location of the followers, should any remain to this day, have been deemed a high-level priority by ORACLE.
