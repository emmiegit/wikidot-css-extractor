**&#34;May the smallest of creatures be the base of our foundation&#34;**

//Official Site-95 motto//
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;paper&#34;]]

Site-95 is a rapidly growing site based in Hobart, Tasmania.

The land around Site-95 was originally owned by a rich aristocratic family, known for their power and influence. After being exposed for demonic rituals, any traces of their existence was wiped from global memory. It was decided then that the land they owned would come under Foundation control.

Site-95 was then established as a small testing facility for biological and ecological anomalies in the South Pacific region and Tasman sea. A large majority of these tests took place in the site&#39;s garden. Eventually, in the year 2000, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6220 SCP-6220] arrived on site.

Because of their rigid requirements to keep them content, it was decided that the site would turn into a containment and research site for biological anomalies. Along with this change, the Entomology, Mycology and Botany departments were formed.

At first, these departments were only small, but have since spilled inside the rest of the site, with the whole building completely functioning as the headquarters for the three offices. The Mycology and the Botany departments both got heads of departments, but it was decided that the Department of entomology would have 5 regional directors on account of internal issues. A current head of department for the entomology department is still being decided.

Due to a combination of personnel factors and stress caused by work, Dr.Corey stepped down as Site director to director of Containment. Soon after Dr. Oliver Clement became director.

//Suddenly an alert sounds.//

**Site-95 Command:** Alert! This is not a drill. I repeat, this is not a drill. A large scale containment breach is occurring and heading towards the orientation room. All personnel are to head towards the bunker.

//Panic ensues in the room.//

**Director Oliver:** Well I was going to show you the slide, but I guess we can go there ourselves. Just think of this as a walking tour.

//Everyone leaves the orientation room and heads into the main hallway. They pass by a poster of the site layout.//

**Gamma Sector**
Houses D class cells and an onsite cafeteria, Also Features a Safe class Containment Zone.

**Delta Sector**
Research labs, directly connected to the containment zones.

**Epsilon Sector**
Euclid and Keter Containment Zone. A low-yield conventional explosive is installed.

**Director Oliver:** 300 or so people in this whole facility. Fun fact: We are one of the last Foundation sites to still use D-class, took a bit of arguing with the ethics committee.

**Dr Lora Kelli:** What are you doing here! We have to go, there&#39;s a breach!

//The group begins to run.//

**Dr Lora Kelli:** Oh, My name is Lora Kelli and I&#39;m the director of Personnel here at site-95. Now come on, we have to get yous&#39;ins safe.

//Silence occurs for 30 seconds//

**Researcher:** Director Oliver, why are you so laid back when there is a breach happening?

**Director Oliver:** Good question, I guess I don&#39;t really know. See at one point we were indestructible, we had all the best technology in the Foundation. However, one day the security systems malfunctioned and a breach occurred, we weren&#39;t able to respond back as none of us had the skills. We lost many good people that day.

We started being serious from then, sure we got even better technology, but most importantly, we got some of the best men and women on the planet here. We got specialized training exercises too. All that said, I am so laid back right now as I believe we have the skills necessary to deal with this breach. Believe it or not, I can actually be quite serious, technology must be used to assist in our operations, but we must not rely on it for everything or otherwise we get a situation like earlier. There was a reason why that exam was so difficult.

Sorry, I ramble on sometimes.

**Researcher:** I see.

//An armed group  of personnel appear down the corridor.//

**Commander Kirk Arnold:** Move out of the way! [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5771 SCP-5771] is breaching containment! Get to the safe section, now!

**Dr Lora Kelli:** Don&#39;t mind him. He&#39;s the director of security here and can get quite hot tempered in these sorts of situations. He&#39;s not always like this.

//The group manages to get to the Beta sector, past an armed door.//

**Dr Lora Kelli:** We&#39;re at the Beta sector, should be safe over here. Tell me if you need anything.

**Director Oliver:** Well, as we are safe we can continue the tour, let&#39;s start with the entomology department.

//They all head inside of a large room with a placecard saying &#39;Department of Entomology.&#39; Inside is a busy room full of desks stacked with paperwork and the constant moving of people. There are various memorabilia of insects and plants.//

**Director Anne:** Oh, hello! I&#39;m director Anne Tina, head of the north American region of the department. Yeah, we don&#39;t really have a department head yet, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6220 management issues.] Moving on, here at site-95, we are the biggest department here at 95 and only entomological office in the whole Foundation so feel free to ask any questions.

**Researcher:** How&#39;s it like here?

**Director Anne:** Honestly, pretty fun. People think this department is tedious and boring. You get to go out to the garden, field missions and you get to work with the best entomological scientists in the whole Foundation. We also do some pretty unconventional things, there is a reason why our motto is &#34;Odd is to be expected.&#34;

You&#39;ll probably get a more specialized introduction to this department if you apply here so I don&#39;t want to spoil too much.

Oh, one last thing. Mind the skeleton on the ceiling, you should have seen it before it was neutralized. [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6048 It was beautiful.]

//The audience claps.//

**Director Oliver:** Next department, mycology. One of the strangest.

//The group of researchers exit the room and head past the white corridor to the mycology room.//

**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5144 Dr. Mabel Zaretsky:]** I heard you all were coming, welcome to the Mycology department.

//The room is dimmer and quieter than the entomology department room ,but still as cluttered.//

**Dr Mabel Zaretsky:** Yeah, apologies for the mess, we just got a shipment of mind controlling fungi from [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/dokumentacja-bezpiecznej-placowki-strefa-pl-34 Poland.] Our main purpose here is just transferring and storing from site to site. We keep a few low risk ones here for research too.

You do a lot of paperwork here ,but when you get to really study these specimens and find practical ways to use them is so interesting. I actually used some of the fungi here in my dinner last night. That&#39;s all so I suggest signing up if you are interested.

//A noise is heard coming from her walkie talkie.//

**Dr Mabel Zaretsky:** Damn it! Yeah, I don&#39;t really like to swear but one of the specimens of fungi has escaped their crate! Just wait here, you&#39;ll also get a show.

//She goes outside, wearing a full hazmat suit with other personnel following here. The group looks outside the large window to get a better view.//

**Dr Mabel Zaretsky:** Come on, lift it carefully. We wouldn&#39;t want half the site being brainwashed.

//They pick up the fungi and lower it to a crate. However in doing so, she accidentally touches it with a portion of her bear hand. She heads back.//

**Dr Mabel Zaretsky:** Don&#39;t worry you all, I&#39;m not affected. Years of experience gives you resistance to these types of anomalies. I&#39;m still gonna wash my hands, can&#39;t be too safe.

**Director Oliver:** Okay, time for the last one, botany.

//They move to the last department room, botany. It is the smallest one and is less cluttered with only a few house plants at the side. A tall man is seen in the center at his desk.//

**Dr Kyle Earnest:** S&#39;up This is the botany department, the smallest of the three &#34;sister&#34; departments. Now, I know you are probably pretty bored of people explaining their departments to you, so we&#39;ll mix it up a bit. See that plant to the left of you, touch it.

//They all do so.//

**Researcher:** One second it feels slimy, next soft and then rough.

**Dr Kyle Earnest:** Exactly, it changes its texture ,but looks the same. These are the sorts of things we deal with in Botany. Even if we are the smallest, we are the ones who keep the garden in the best shape possible  for all of the other departments. We even make anomalous medicine using these plants, how do you think we have such a low death rate?

Apart from all of that, we are pretty relaxed here. This is more of a sanctuary from the chaoticness of the rest of the site.

//The group once again leaves and enters the hallway.//

**Director Oliver:** We also have other departments ,but we don&#39;t have enough time to get to them, like the Security department, the Janitorial department and yes, sigh, the Etymology department. So, is that all? Done the site layout, done the departments. Oh, the anomaly index. There&#39;s a list on the opposite side of the hall.

//An alert sounds again.//

**Site-95 Command:** The breach is heading towards the beta sector, personnel are recommended to head to the site garden as it is currently non dangerous.

**Director Oliver:** Oh, shoot! I almost forgot about that there&#39;s a breach going on, follow me.

//They pass through the safety locks and head into the garden. Various large plants and mushrooms are seen, a small roar is heard in the distance.//

[[include component:image-block name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/SF_Japanese_Garden.JPG|width=50%|align=right|caption= Containment Area -1A.]]

**Researcher:** Uhhhh, what is that noise?

**Director Oliver:** Don&#39;t worry those are just some experiments by the departments, they should be friendly, hopefully. Doesn&#39;t matter we are almost at the end.

//A group of small bugs start to head towards the group.//

**Agent:** Aww, they look so cute!

**Director Oliver:** Be careful here, don&#39;t touch anything.

//Suddenly, a large insect-like creature breaks in. It has multiple dark heads and regularly twitches. It start to rapidly approach the group. The group begins to panic//

**Director Oliver:** Dammit, dammit, I don&#39;t want a full group of researchers to die here.

//Panic quickly ensues in the crowd.//

**Researcher:** Will we be safe!?

**Director Oliver:** Yes, I think so!

//Just then, a group of small anomalous critters attack the large one. It quickly gets buried over the sea of insects and loses consciousness. A team of armed personnel then start to contain the rest.//

**Director Oliver:** Woah. Some of the creatures they make here in the garden are weird. But I knew we would be saved, like I said earlier, just not in the most conventional way.

And that&#39;s how Site-95 works. We always seem to get laughed at, thinking we are a waste of money. For much of our history we were an afterthought, nothing more than another site in the grand organization of the Foundation. But this is changing, we are getting more and more staff, anomalies and most importantly of all, attention. Even though we may have challenges ahead of us, we will be able to overcome them.

So what is Site-95?

Site-95 is hope.
