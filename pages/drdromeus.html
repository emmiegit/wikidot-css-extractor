Yes, my first article was a keter humanoid &#34;monster what kills you&#34; (kids, don&#39;t try this at home!) and yes I have no shame. My inspiration? Mummies are scary. So I made a mummy. Then I kinda just kept going and threw in a bit of spooky and some Egyptian mythology and kept adding until I liked what I had. The ending just sort of came to me while I was writing so I threw it in and luckily it just worked. I made the mummy picture myself too - twice, actually, since the first time I failed to navigate the tricky waters of CC-compliancy correctly. I&#39;m not particularly knowledgeable about image manipulation so I just kinda did my best and put a lot of time into it and I think it looks pretty good.

Anoati! Oh, how could you not love the little god? This one came from an idea of a &#34;powerful&#34; island god getting taken by the Foundation and finding out its abilities aren’t worth two cents here. Then I thought it would be funny to have it relate its woes to a therapist, but the relationship began becoming more like a friendship almost as I wrote it so I stuck with it. First SCP I wrote that breached 50 upvotes so that’s pretty cool. Ya can’t help but love Anoati, am I right?

Written for 2021 JamCon. This short piece comes from a profound fear of kelp I have realized I possess. It’s irrational, but that stuff scares the shit out of me whenever I snorkel. I tried to convey some of that fear into this article, with a healthy dose of gore on top of that. It’s not my best-received piece, but I enjoy the simplicity of it.

This was a situation where the pictures came first and I worked backwards - I’m not exactly sure why I decided the two images I’d use would be a chipmunk with beers and a pro-Scottish independence web ad, but I’m pretty glad I went with it because I think it’s a nice little article.

A weak island god, a brain hacker, and a mad neuroscientist walk into a tale. The result? Another weird entry for the [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-oct-hub Original Characters Tournament]! This was just as fun to write as the first one. After this one, however, I was out of the contest, so I never really continued the story after leaving it on a cliffhanger. That’s on me, sorry guys. Maybe one day I’ll wrap it up nicely. It’s been a little while though.

Ah, the first of the Dromeus Monologue trilogy! This was written in one sitting in a burst of passion, and I decided it would be a good way to bring Dr. Dromeus into the SCP universe.

Co-written with [[*user CanOfSoup]] as part of the Canon Renaissance Contest as [http://www.scpwiki.com/team-epitaphic-hub Team Epitaphic]. It was a blast working with Soup, and believe me when I say it won’t be the last time, because we’ve got things planned in the future that’ll knock your socks off.

BIG IRON ON HIS HIIIIIIIIIP. Okay, where was I? Ah yes, Edward Kelly. This duology from the Canon Renaissance Contest’s [http://www.scpwiki.com/team-epitaphic-hub Team Epitaphic] was not read or liked by many, but I really liked it. Fun to write and fun to read, at least according to me. It was a blast converting SCPs and GoIs to the Aces and Eights canon, and then having a hardened lawmaker fight them. Also got to listen to a bunch of western songs for &#34;research&#34; so that was fun.

Also part of the Canon Renaissance Contest’s [http://www.scpwiki.com/team-epitaphic-hub Team Epitaphic] and the second part of the Kelly duology. The original goal was to have the outlaw at the end be Nathan Rivers, letting each of the stories connect to each other, but that didn’t work out so it’s just some outlaw. I mean, the meaning still stands and I like how it works out, but it could’ve been nice. It may also be confusing why I chose for the ending song to be “Hurt,” by the Nine Inch Nails, when every other song used was a western. Well, the answer is Johnny Cash. I loved his version enough that I chose to have it frame the ending scene.

This is the best thing I have ever written. If you love me you will read this. After literally spending years writing and rewriting and revising, I’m very proud of the result. SCP-002 is one of the highest-rated articles on the site, yet there is almost nothing written related to it. So I took matters into my own hands, taking the good and the bad and trying to interpret the article into something that made sense for me. The article hints at things such a space-based origin, perception-altering abilities, and, of course, a &#34;Mulhausen Incident&#34; which is completely redacted. I took all those elements and made sure to incorporate them into the story. Of course, the theme of &#34;home&#34; was necessary too, as the anomaly literally looks like a home, so I made its abilities fit more into that theme and made this theme relate to the characters as well. All in all, couldn’t be more proud of the results. Read it, please.

My first, and so far only, GoI format! Written for the Doomsday Contest in [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/last-light-hub Team Last Light]. If I’m being honest, it was hard as hell. The GOC format requires a lot of research and made-up tech lingo. But after researching it, I do actually like it a lot. You basically make a piecemeal story out of these different types of documents, and you get to tell it in a linear fashion, unlike in the SCP format. I also played around with the idea of these &#34;member organizations&#34; that make up the GOC command affecting their operations and supplies, which is definitely something I want to play with more in the future. The team definitely played around with lots of ideas about a post-countermeme world that never got written, but I’ll return to it one day.

[[tab About Me]]
Hello! This is where I put miscellaneous information about myself, I suppose. 

Well, first off, I am always 100% open to collaborating with whoever wants the help, no experience writing an article required. Just send me a message! It is important to note though that I do disappear from the wiki, sometimes for months at a time, so if I don’t respond or you don’t want to chance it, you can always message me on Discord too at &#34;Da Russ#4512&#34;. Despite my sometimes lacking motivation, though, I can be a great help as long as you keep pushing me to stay active.

If you want to write anything related to something I’ve created, go for it! I would love if you contact me so I can offer input (and just because I’d be so flattered, gosh), but you don’t have to. Just having it exist is nice enough.

Thank you for reading my works!
