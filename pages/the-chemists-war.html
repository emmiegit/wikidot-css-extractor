the carpet was mud
the blankets, trenches
as i crawled through them

crimson colored cups and towels
strewn about the living room
then
splattered strings of various viscera 
sprawled across the battlefield 

one fluorescent light 
fixed upon
a grey popcorn ceiling 
was later
a sun struggling
to shine through 
smoke-chocked skies as
pillows packed neatly 
became bodies piled 

my mind now holds onto the names and 
birth dates of 
comrades 
who i never actually knew
yet my memory can still recall
visions of their
heads bursting 
beneath rows of tank treads

i cannot forget those fleeting images 
of the steel airplanes that flew over me 
nor the black bombs which they released
and how they plummeted downward,
like broken birds that
hadn&#39;t learned to fly
for they had no mothers 
who could show them how

i cannot forget the fire 
from bombs, tanks, grenades 
which grew rapidly
but faded fast
as most great plumes of hatred 
often do

i cannot forget the way that war ended
a ceasefire called into action 
an immediate realization and
a cold collapse of dream
as the tainted ether regressed 
back to a dimly-lit plafond
while the screeching 
and screaming finally
flew to a 
halt

i know not the name behind
the internal method capable of
condensing 
four years of flame
into four minutes of reality
into eight unorganized stanzas 
but i do know 
that i have witnessed it here
and i fear it immensely</textarea></pre>
