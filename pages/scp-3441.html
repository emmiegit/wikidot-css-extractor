**Item #:** SCP-3441

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Site-66 cryogenically freezes all seeds produced by SCP-3441. An SCP-3441 orchard is located within Site-66 and maintains a current total of 131 SCP-3441 instances.

Every month SCP-3441 instances are to be harvested for their leaves which are to be refined into Red-Wisp class substances. Red-Wisp class substances are to be stored in excess at Site-66. 

**Description:** SCP-3441 is an organism of the genus //Camellia//, most closely related to //Camellia sinensis.//[[footnote]] Commonly known as the &#34;tea plant&#34;, &#34;tea shrub&#34; or &#34;tea tree&#34; [[/footnote]] SCP-3441 instances are visually similar to //C. sinensis// beside red discoloration of the leaves. Discoloration is due to presence of Substance PR-O11. 

Substance PR-O11 is a relatively chemically inert substance which, when ingested, induces a localized reality-bending effect in the subject. When ingested, Substance PR-O11 has a half-life of two hours.

Substance PR-O11&#39;s reality altering effects occur as a probability deviation against expected results/values. Probabilities tend towards equal distribution, correlated with the exponential consumption of Substance PR-O11.

**Addendum A:**

&gt; +++ Person of Interest Report: Viraj Singh
&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; **Birth Name:** Viraj Singh
&gt; **Title:** Dr
&gt; **Profession:** Medical Doctor 
&gt; **Associated Persons:**
&gt; * Urvi Singh - Wife (Deceased) 
&gt; * Arti Singh - Daughter
&gt; 
&gt; **Reason for Interest:** Dr Singh trained to be a general practitioner of medicine in the United Kingdom&#39;s National Health Service. Dr Singh&#39;s performance in aiding patients began to fall, prompting him to move to the United States of America.
&gt; 
&gt; Using his medical knowledge, Dr Singh set up his own private sector health clinic &#34;Singh&#39;s Hospice&#34;, caring for those thought to be terminally ill. Paradoxically, Singh&#39;s survival rates for these patients matches and in some areas, exceeds, his specialist peers. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Update - ████/██/██:** Survival rates assumed to be the effects of SCP-3441. Post interview and amnestication of Dr Singh, POI status revoked.

**Addendum B:**
&gt; [[=]]
&gt; +++ Interview Transcript
&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; **Interviewee:** Dr Viraj Singh
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Reseacher ████
&gt;
&gt; ------
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;** 
&gt; 
&gt; **████:** Hello there, Dr Singh. I&#39;d like to ask you a few questions, is that alright?
&gt; 
&gt; **Singh:** Yeah, I don&#39;t mind. Try and keep it short though, I&#39;ve got patients to handle.
&gt; 
&gt; **████:** Of course. I&#39;ll try to cut to the chase. Why did you open up the hospice?
&gt; 
&gt; **Singh:** I thought my skills would be better put in hospice care, rather than the NHS. I&#39;d like to get to know my patients, rather than see them for five minutes.
&gt; 
&gt; //A branch retrieved from SCP-3441 is placed in front of Dr Singh//
&gt; 
&gt; **████:** Do you recognise this object?
&gt; 
&gt; **Singh:** Where did you find this?
&gt; 
&gt; **████:** We found it among your personal items. We believe you have been utilising this item to aid your patients. Is this correct?
&gt; 
&gt; //Dr Singh remains silent//
&gt; 
&gt; **████:** When did you become aware of this plant&#39;s anomalous properties?
&gt; 
&gt; //Dr Singh sighs//
&gt; 
&gt; **Singh:** So, you&#39;re taking that plant away from me, aren&#39;t you?
&gt; 
&gt; **████:** Unfortunately, yes.
&gt; 
&gt; //Dr Singh pinches the bridge of his nose and sighs//
&gt; 
&gt; **Singh:** I figured it out years ago. I noticed a pattern emerging. When I tried to help someone who was almost certainly going to recover soon, they remained ill for weeks. When I walked, I would trip more often, things would break more easily. At first, I thought I was cursed.
&gt; 
&gt; //Dr Singh pauses//
&gt; 
&gt; **Singh:** But then I realised that I wasn&#39;t cursed, it only happened when I drank homebrewed tea from my pet plant.
&gt; 
&gt; **████:** How effective has the tea been in your medical performance?
&gt; 
&gt; **Singh:** It gives and takes. If you use it on a person that&#39;s getting better they&#39;re more likely to become sick again. But the sicker the person, the more likely they are to be cured. This is why I opened a hospice, you understand? For those with a very, very low chance to live get the most benefit from the tea.
&gt; 
&gt; //Dr Singh picks up the SCP-3441 branch//
&gt; 
&gt; **Singh:** Before every procedure I took a cup of tea from this plant. I don&#39;t do anything more than give them their medicine, change their IV drips and clean their bedsheets. I&#39;ve compared myself with other doctors, I don&#39;t do anything special. My patients live while theirs die.
&gt; 
&gt; //Dr Singh sighs and places the SCP-3441 branch down//
&gt; 
&gt; **Singh:** I can&#39;t tell where my skill starts and that plant ends. I don&#39;t even know if I&#39;m qualified to be a doctor anymore. I don&#39;t think I deserve to be, at any rate.
&gt; 
&gt; **████:** Care to explain?
&gt; 
&gt; **Singh:** Do you deserve to be a researcher, sir? How do you know? You prove it to yourself by reflecting on your projects. When you drink the tea your skill becomes irrelevant. You&#39;ll never know what parts were you and which parts were the plant.
&gt; 
&gt; //Dr Singh pauses briefly//
&gt; 
&gt; **Singh:** All I do now is care for people and pray that they live. Nothing fancy, nothing special. It&#39;s just luck.
&gt; 
&gt; **████:** If you seriously doubted your skills, couldn&#39;t you stop drinking the tea?
&gt; 
&gt; **Singh:** I can&#39;t say I haven&#39;t thought about it, but how could I? I took an oath to try to help everyone to the best of my ability. Who do I decide to test it on? Tom, the child with leukaemia, bed-ridden for life? That kid&#39;s got more life in him than you or me. Or George, the old man with a brain tumor who can hardly speak? When he listens to you talk about your day, you know he cares. I could go on for days...
&gt; 
&gt; //Dr Singh pauses//
&gt; 
&gt; **Singh:** I can&#39;t put these people at risk for my own peace of mind. I&#39;d sooner die myself.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt;
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **Post-script:** Dr Singh was released from Foundation custody and amnesticised after this interview. Dr Singh was returned to the United Kingdom and enrolled in his prior position. Dr Singh&#39;s business prospects in the USA have been shut down permanently and assets liquidated. Compensation has been sent to Dr Singh under the guise of tax errors, spanning over a decade as to not arouse suspicion.
&gt; 
&gt; **Update - ████/██/██:** Observations of Dr Singh post-release have shown no deviations from the norm in terms of performance.
