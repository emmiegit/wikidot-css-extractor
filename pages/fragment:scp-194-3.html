    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Item #:** SCP-194

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-194 is contained in a standard computer file.

**Description:** SCP-194 is a document with various mathematical equations and symbols written upon it.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Addenda 194.A-194.C: Documentation of SCP-194-Z&#34; hide=&#34;Close&#34;]]

**Addendum 194.A (Object Class):** Euclid

**Addendum 194.B (Special Containment Procedures):** The object presently designated SCP-194 is contained in a concrete mausoleum located in a New Orleans cemetery, the location of which is included in attached file 194-LOC-A. The mausoleum is to be checked for damage or deterioration once every 30 days. Any reality-restructuring effects of SCP-194 which appear to impact the space outside of it should be reported to containment staff.

Due to the effects of SCP-194-Z upon the SCP-194 designation, the acting documentation of SCP-194-Z is presented in the form of various addenda to the acting SCP-194 designation. Any secondary classifications are to be assigned in reverse alphabetical order (i.e. SCP-194-Z), and all addenda are to be designated alphabetically, rather than numerically (i.e. Addendum 194.A). This is to prevent conflict with documentation applied to the SCP-194 designation.

Despite changes to the SCP-194 designation, Addenda 194.A through 194.C describe the true nature of SCP-194-Z, and will remain unaltered regardless of other edits.

**Addendum 194.C (Description):** SCP-194-Z refers to a phenomenon surrounding the SCP-194 designation. Various objects are assigned to the SCP-194 designation at various times, causing the SCP-194 file to be altered based on the affected object. Only one object can be assigned to the SCP-194 slot at any time, causing minor retroactive alterations to support the containment of each object in Foundation custody. 

Notably, most affected objects assigned to the SCP-194 designation are non-anomalous in nature. No known connection between these items exists and how they came to be in Foundation custody is unknown. All associated objects exhibit high levels of dimensional instability.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Addendum 194.D: Reconnaissance report (Excerpt)&#34; hide=&#34;Close&#34;]]
Field agents, designated Zulu-Niner and Bravo-Delta, were dispatched to Our Lady of Repentance cemetery in Orleans Parish due to a radio signal emanating from the location (Attached, Addendum 194.G). On arrival, agents found the mausoleum in the attached report open. Inside, they discovered the mummified remains of a human male in contemporary clothing. Identification cards identified him as Garth Richard, but no records of said person can be found. Subject&#39;s wallet also included contact information for Foundation researcher Laura Kane, but after questioning she indicates she has no recollection of the deceased subject.

&gt; Researcher, Laura Kane, Regarding SCP-194. 04/23/2019. The restructuring effects of the object appear to have caused a change in baseline reality configuration. SCP-194 appears otherwise unchanged, and its anomalous effects have returned to normal. I am currently researching what triggered the effect.

&gt; Richard, G: ...knew you&#39;d come to check on it.
&gt; 
&gt; Kane, L: You don&#39;t have authorization to be here. I heard yours got revoked.
&gt; 
&gt; Richard, G: Well...
&gt; 
&gt; Kane, L: Oh my god. Did you //steal// my authorization code?
&gt; 
&gt; Richard, G: It was the only way to—
&gt;

**Interviewer:** Internal Affairs Agent #01-2204
**Subject:** Kane, Laura
**Date:** 04/24/2019

&gt; **Interviewer:** And you&#39;ve listened to the audio of 194-LOC-A, right?
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** I did.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** In your opinion, whose voice—
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** Mine.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** What is your opinion on what happened?
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** I—she—was cornered, and reacted. She. Um. Defended herself.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Killed him, you mean.
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** With the only things available to her at the time?
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Which would have been...
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** SCP-194.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** And what are your thoughts on the matter?
&gt; 
&gt; //Long pause.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** You want me to say that she—or I—made the wrong decision. But I don&#39;t think that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** What //do// you think?
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** That whatever reality &#39;Garth&#39; is from doesn&#39;t have him in it, and neither does ours.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Alright. That about wraps this up. Thank you for your cooperation.
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** What?
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Hm?
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** Sorry. Nothing.
