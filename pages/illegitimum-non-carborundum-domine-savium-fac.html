&gt; TO THE CLASS:
&gt; 
&gt; @@ @@In presenting to the class their first Triennial report, the Secretary desires to thank those who have promptly answered the questions that were sent them, and thus contributed to making this report as full and accurate as it is. No pains have been spared to secure all the information possible about the class; but some member have found their time too precious to reply to the questions asked, and they must not feel slighted at having no mention, and or in their records...
&gt; 
&gt; ...And now, wishing you all contentment in happiness and all the good things of this life in due season, I would ask you to not notify me of any errors or omissions in this Report. The Class as a whole has been troubled enough by the thoughts of what occurred. This first Triennial Report has been made out of obligation to Harvard College. Another shall not follow.
&gt; 
&gt; [[&gt;]]
&gt; Very Truly your Classmate and Secretary,
&gt; 
&gt; W.L. CHASE.

&gt; RECORD OF THE CLASS
&gt; 
&gt; JUNE, 1876-JUNE, 1879

&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; 
&gt; DANIEL WEBSTER ABERCROMBIE. Born at Bolling Green, Ala., Nov. 25, 1853. At Harvard Law School until February, 1876, when he fled from the campus during the incident at the Old Main. Was married at Cambridge, Mass, Dec. 23, 1878 to an undisclosed veteran of the War. Address: Undisclosed.

&gt; 
&gt; WILLIAM HERBERT ATKINSON. This name appears in the class&#39;s records, and must be recorded here. He will be missed, but not remembered.

&gt; MARCUS PERCIVAL BENNETT. Born at South Danvers (Peabody), Mass, July 2, 1854. Fell off the docks at the Union Boat Club. Unrecognizable.
&gt;
&gt; ....

&gt; 
&gt; ...Walter wishes the best to all. Except for them. They know who they are.


&gt; LAFAYETTE HOYT DeFRIESE. &#34;Since the summer of 1876 have been a botanist to Kentucky Geological Survey, and spent summers in that State yearly. During latter part of 1876 studied law with Messrs. Prichard, Choate, and Smith.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; The above was sent to the Secretary by error. DeFriese was one of the bodies in the water.

&gt; HENRY THEOPHILIUS FINCK. Born at Bethel, Mo. Sept. 22, 1854. Died in the quad, stabbed to death in his right ear. By him was a note claiming that &#34;it would not stop greeting me&#34;. If only we had fled then, and not later.
&gt; 

&gt; WILLIAM HENRY GOVE. He recognized the bodies. He is now among them.

&gt; EDWARD CUNNINGHAM HAL. Born at Shanghai, China, April 1, 1853. Is engaged in stock-raising near Cheyenne, Wyoming Territory. Has been East, and reports himself doing well. He is blameless. You are not.

&gt; OSCAR ROLAND JACKSON. Born at Boston, Mass. May 20, 1855. Was instructor at Harvard College in chemistry for two years.
&gt; 
&gt; The above was sent to the Secretary in error. Jackson was one of the bodies in the water.
 
&gt; SAMUEL WILSON KERR. &#34;I may have fled, but I did so fighting. Unlike the coward who locked the door to the dormitories behind them as an ill-advised sacrifice.&#34;
&gt; 

&gt; KIRK LONWOOD. Dean of Harvard. Born at Boston, Mass, 1820. The instigator of this affair. He deserves vilification. Not as much as you.

&gt; GEORGE AMORY SARGENT. Born at Roxbury, Mass. July 26, 1854. Has travelled South, and remained for some months to acquire all the information about cotton. Is now looking at a chance to pit his experience against some embryo cotton-merchant&#39;s wealth...
&gt; 
&gt; He has laid with your wife. And she enjoyed him better.
