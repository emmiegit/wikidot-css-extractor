+ Introduction 
The Library contains every book that was ever written, will be written, and many that never were. It&#39;s a treasure trove of knowledge, the only one of its kind the multiverse.

Unfortunately, a catalogue of that magnitude means finding things becomes a bit... difficult. The minds of the Archivists are branded with the details and location of every book at any time, but that kind of knowledge comes at a cost too high for most mortals. Some say the Library likes to lead people to what they&#39;re looking for, but it also likes to see people put in the effort to seek out some of the rarer tomes.

That&#39;s where you come in.

When many Wanderers notice a lack of titles for a specific section, a Scavenger Hunt is called. All Wanderers are encouraged and rewarded for doing the exhaustive task of finding new tomes for that section, pulling them from inside the Library and out, from forgotten shelves and burned out ruins.

The season culminates in a 6 day frenzy. The Huntsmaster will put the name of one of the more lacking sections in the Main Hall, and patrons are given 48 hours to find the best entry for that section they can. Three sections, 144 hours, and an infinitude of possibilities.

Better get hunting, Wanderer.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Show Contest Rules&#34;]]
+ Rules

The Scavenger Hunt consists of three 48-hour periods. At the beginning of each period, the Librarians will produce a theme. This can range from something as general as Outer Space to as specific as Cursed Food. Your job is to write something, anything, that adheres to the theme of the period. It can be a traditional story, a letter, a treatise - if you can justify it in your author post, its allowed in.

You are free to solicit as much critique as you can get within the time period.

# The contest will begin at **12:01 AM (EST) on Jan 22nd** and end at **12:01 AM (EST) on Jan 28th**. Contest voting will end on Feb 11th.
# As soon as a theme is announced, entries for that theme are IN PROGRESS: they should be worked on but cannot be posted.
# Once 24 hours have elapsed since the beginning of the IN-PROGRESS period, entries for that theme are OPEN and can be posted.
# As soon as the NEXT theme is announced, entries for the PREVIOUS theme are CLOSED and cannot be posted for the contest. To clarify: you can still post articles for closed themes to the site, but they will not be considered as valid entries for the purpose of the contest.
# Authors may submit any number of entries per theme, but only the highest-rated entry per theme will be considered for voting totals.
# Once period 3 closes, entries will have two weeks to gather votes. After 14 days, votes will be tallied and winners decided.
# All entries are allowed - no galleries (art-focused pages) this time. Sorry artists.
# Entries can be as long or as short as you want.
# Authors do not have to submit entries for all three themes; you may pick and choose which themes to submit to, but only authors who submit entries for all three themes will be considered for the Grand Prize. 
# No significant content edits may be made after the entry has been posted until the contest has ended. SPaG, Wikidot syntax, and CSS edits are allowed, but significant changes to the content are prohibited. A good rule of thumb is that if you wouldn&#39;t do it to someone else&#39;s work, don&#39;t do it to your own until the contest ends.
# Contest entries will go through the normal deletion process. As there is no limit on the number of entries you may post, you may always reenter. However, you may not repost a new version of a previously deleted entry in the contest. You can always submit these documents to the site again, but they cannot reenter the contest.
# Entries must be new and original. Preexisting drafts are not allowed.
# Shenanigans Rule: The contest organizers reserve the right to disqualify entries and entrants for behavior they deem unsportsmanlike, such as downvoting other contestants&#39; entries solely to gain a vote advantage or excessively self-promoting their articles. If you&#39;re not sure whether or not your action will fall under the Shenanigans Rule, ask either [[*user ROUNDERHOUSE]] or [[*user Rumetzen]]

Tag your entries with &#39;hunt2021&#39; and the theme&#39;s subtag, if applicable!

Remember: you can draft your [https://wanderers-sandbox.wikidot.com/ stories in the sandbox], then post them to the main site when they&#39;re ready. If you want a refresher on the posting process, check out [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/orientation the Orientation]&#39;s Guide To Writing tab.
