**Special Containment Procedures:** The remains of SCP-54512A instances are to be stored in a standard containment locker.

**Description:** SCP-5451 was a virtual school primarily attended by animals in the family //Spheniscidae//, more commonly known as penguins. Hosted on the site penguinschool.aq, students interacted with teachers through voice chat along with assignments sent through messaging programs.

SCP-5451-1 were a group of sentient, English-speaking penguins that accessed the internet through anomalous means. Communication with other SCP-5451-1 instances were done through a forum on the site forum.penguinschool.aq. Non-anomalous penguins turned into SCP-5451-1 instances when they came into contact with advertisements made by previous SCP-5451-1 instances. These memetically enhanced advertisements (henceforth referred to as SCP-5451-2) came in two forms, banner ads or flyers, SCP-5451-2A and SCP-5451-2B respectively.

SCP-5451-2A instances were flyers composed of feathers that are covered in urea. They were found in penguin mating spots after mating season. Penguins that came into contact with SCP-5451-2A turned into an SCP-5451-1 instance. After one academic year, they were enrolled in SCP-5451.
SCP-5451-2B instances were banner ads found on the Internet. They took the format of a penguin on the foreground along with the text &#34;(common name of a penguin) Penguin School, the best University in the country!&#34;, or some variation of the text.

On 2023/02/01, the forums where SCP-5451-1 instances gathered and used to enroll into SCP-5451 were closed due to a lack of funding.

**Addendum: Final Post of the Forum**

On 2022/07/11, one day before the closure of the forums, the cessation of all anomalous effects of SCP-5451-2A and SCP-5451-2B, and one academic year before the closure of SCP-5451, a post was made on the forums.

&gt;
&gt; Hello guys, Forster here.
&gt;
&gt;Thank you for all the efforts you have made to continue this forum. From the fundraising, to the efforts of our Marketing college, all of your efforts has been appreciated. It was heartwarming to see all of us as a community try our hardest to keep our community alive even after the loss of funding for our forums
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunately, despite all our efforts, the forums will have to be closed, for we were not able to gather enough money to keep the servers up.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Don&#39;t worry about losing those forum threads, though. They will be archived and kept as they are.
&gt; Again, thank you for all the memories, experiences, and threads you all have made here. I never would&#39;ve imagined that this simple forum between staff will grow to have such a tight-knit community.
&gt; Thank you for everything, and as the great Douglas Adams say,
&gt; &#34;So long, and thanks for all the fish&#34;
&gt; &lt;3
