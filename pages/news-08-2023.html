The SCP Foundation Official Discord is fully open! Affectionately referred to as 19cord, this Discord server is a great place to interact with the rest of the community and make friends. There are channels for general discussion, posting artwork, talking about your favorite SCPs, and much more! There is also a reading club that meets a few times a month to read underread and underrated articles, and a critique space where wiki members can get critique on writing and artwork!

You can join the server at https://discord.gg/scp! Please note that the server is only open to ages 16+, and the critique spaces require you to be a wiki member.

We also interviewed several members of the discord to share their personal experiences. Here are a few snippets of the interviews!
&gt; **How would you describe your personal experience on 19cord?**
&gt;
&gt; ##red|It&#39;s been fairly good! I&#39;ve been around since the first stages of 19cord and it&#39;s been amazing watching the community grow and flourish over time. I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m probably more of a lurker than others - mostly just watching the artwork and art crit channels - but recently I&#39;ve been more involved with the reading clubs and that&#39;s been really fun! I think that just goes to show there&#39;s something for everyone to  enjoy in 19cord, and all the folks who have helped out should be very proud of the work they&#39;ve put in! - UncertaintyCrossing##

&gt; **What is your favorite thing about 19cord or its culture?**
&gt;
&gt; ##green|I&#39;d have to say how open it is. From my personal experience, it&#39;s easy to slide into a conversation and contribute if you want. Nobody ever really gets ignored, and it&#39;s generally a non-hostile environment. - BitOddInnit##

&gt; **Would you say that 19cord is a good place for both first time and experienced authors to get critique?**
&gt;
&gt; ##blue|I would. No matter how much you&#39;ve written, you could always use a couple of extra eyes on your work, and the crit space has more than a couple of eyes. And in 19cord, those eyes know what they&#39;re doing. - Matthgeek##

&gt; **How would you say critique on 19cord compares to critique on other spaces?**
&gt;
&gt; ##purple|Critique on the forums feels more like writing a letter to someone.  I feel like I need to touch on every single point in one message, and then the author responds in another big message, and we go back and forth like that.  19cord crit feels more like texting.  I&#39;ll just mention one or two things in a few sentences, and the author responds with a few sentences.  Generally, crit over discord feels much less formal and a bit more personal. - scalykitty##

&gt; **What makes 19cord&#39;s reading club fun in your opinion?**
&gt;
&gt; ###c76a12|Hearing other people&#39;s views on a written piece, getting an opportunity to read stories you haven&#39;t read before, exposing people to stories you like that they haven&#39;t read before, talking about the SCP setting/concepts along with the art of writing in general, banter, etc. - Crow-Cat##

These were just snippets, but we also included the interviews in their entirety. You can find them below!

**How would you describe your personal experience on 19cord?**
##blue|Excellent. I&#39;ve always felt welcome there, and it&#39;s just been a great experience overall.##

**How would you say critique on 19cord compares to other critique spaces?**
##blue|I think that Dagon runs a really tight ship, and the crit given and received in Deer college is effective, actionable, and clear. The critters receive the support they need to effectively crit, and the whole thing&#39;s organized quite well.##

**Do you feel your critique in 19cord has been effective in improving works that make it to the site?**
##blue|One hundred percent. I&#39;ve seen ideas come in and articles come out, and they&#39;ve improved tremendously. Speaking from personal experience, although my first article isn&#39;t great, I have no doubt it would have been deleted on sight had I worked from my original idea, without crit.##

**Would you say that 19cord is a good place for both first time and experienced authors to get critique?**
##blue|I would. No matter how much you&#39;ve written, you could always use a couple of extra eyes on your work, and the crit space has more than a couple of eyes. And in 19cord, those eyes know what they&#39;re doing.##

**What is your favorite thing about 19cord or its culture?**
##blue|That&#39;s tough. There&#39;s a lot of great things about 19cord, but I think my favorite is honestly the Deer College crit space. It&#39;s just such a healthy place for critique, which so often can become just tearing people down.##

**Is there anything else you would like to share that I didn&#39;t ask about?**
##blue|I think that it&#39;s a great place for any SCP fan, especially those looking to get involved in the community, whether that be art, writing, or crit.##

**How would you describe your personal experience in 19cord?**
##red|It&#39;s been fairly good! I&#39;ve been around since the first stages of 19cord and it&#39;s been amazing watching the community grow and flourish over time. I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m probably more of a lurker than others - mostly just watching the artwork and art crit channels - but recently I&#39;ve been more involved with the reading clubs and that&#39;s been really fun! I think that just goes to show there&#39;s something for everyone to  enjoy in 19cord, and all the folks who have helped out should be very proud of the work they&#39;ve put in!##

**How do the art critique channels function? Are they a good place to receive critique on artwork?**
##red|I would say they are a good place to receive feedback, or at least I hope the people who have used art crit thus far have enjoyed their experience! Myself and IronShears have been working hard to make it place where artists feel supported and get constructive feedback they can work with. In terms of how the channel functions - you create a thread with the art piece you&#39;re working on, along with filling out a short template explaining what you need help with, and then one one of the art critic folks will reach out to help you. One thing I will mention though is that the art critique channels are limited in the fact they&#39;re for stuff being posted to the wiki only, so we&#39;ve run into situations where people have to scrap what they&#39;ve done because they didn&#39;t follow licensing requirements, or situations where people need help but the art isn&#39;t SCP related, and thus out of crit staff&#39;s purview. We&#39;re brainstorming more ways to help support our artists wanting feedback though, regardless of where the art ends up - so everyone has the opportunity to learn and grow.##

**Is 19cord a good place to share your own artwork, or find artwork that other artists have shared?**
##red|Oh 100%. Especially now that we&#39;re fully public, the general artwork channel has exploded in popularity. I&#39;m honestly so amazed and impressed by how talented and diverse our art community is! There&#39;s folks sharing digital art, traditional art, animation, models, music, logos, book covers - just to name a few! Everyone has also been super supportive towards one another too, complimenting each other and sharing resources with one another. So if you have some artwork to share - we&#39;d love to see it! Whenever you&#39;re ready to show us.##

**What is your favorite part of 19cord or its culture?**
##red|My piece of advice towards communities like 19cord has always been for older fans to remember when you were a newer fan - what was the kind of experience you would have wanted when joining a community for the first time? And so far, I think 19cord has done a great job being that first experience - which is my favorite thing about it.  There is a home for just about any kind of fan there, and that&#39;s not an easy feat to accomplish! Whether you&#39;re an author, artist, casual reader, or brand new to SCP, I&#39;ve seen discussions and events that include everyone.  I think our community has really struggled with the gap between on-site and off-site fans, and while we still have a lot of growth to do, 19cord is a great step foward towards bridging that divide.##

**Is there anything you would like to share that I didn&#39;t ask about?**
##red|I think as a final note I would remind folks, especially authors, to really be aware of the impact and influence you have towards the fans who look up to you and your work, who are super likely to cross paths with you in 19cord. You don&#39;t have to be a role model or their hero or whatever, and you can block and move on if you need to, but just be kind about it. Don&#39;t tear down those who are just getting started. If you have the patience - educate and make things a teaching moment - or leave situations like that to those of us who do. 19cord has been great about this so far and I&#39;m really proud of the progress our community has made, but it doesn&#39;t hurt to have a reminder every once and again! And finally - make sure to give a big thank you to all the folks who keep 19cord up and running! This was a big undertaking and I&#39;m especially grateful for all the people who have gotten it to where it is today.##

[[tab scalykitty]]
**How would you describe your personal experience on 19cord?**
##purple|I mostly stay in the writing channels, so my experience tends to be centered around producing new articles and tales for the wiki.  The rest of the server has always felt a little hectic to me, and even moreso since Phase 7. I really enjoy the writing community that&#39;s grown in the past six months, and I&#39;m excited to see how Phase 7 impacts that community, and the wiki more broadly. ##

**How would you say critique on 19cord compares to other critique spaces?**
##purple|Critique on the forums feels more like writing a letter to someone.  I feel like I need to touch on every single point in one message, and then the author responds in another big message, and we go back and forth like that.  19cord crit feels more like texting.  I&#39;ll just mention one or two things in a few sentences, and the author responds with a few sentences.  Generally, crit over discord feels much less formal and a bit more personal.##

**Would you say 19cord is a good place for first time authors to receive critique on ideas or drafts?**
##purple|Absolutely!  First time authors have access to the moth squad, which is a group of volunteers who they can contact for crit.  As a group, we tend to be very responsive.  There are also a ton of new authors looking to help one another with crit and brainstorming, and I think 19cord is a great way to become a part of the writing community, beyond just getting crit and publishing an article.##

**What about experienced authors? Is it a good place for them to receive critique as well?**
##purple|There&#39;s sort of a running joke that experienced authors only get crit in sidechats.  There&#39;s some truth to that, but there&#39;re also a lot of experienced authors (LordXVNV, OriTiefling, PlaguePJP, etc) who come to 19cord for draft critique.  The benefit of 19cord is that there are so many people giving crit.  You can get opinions from people you&#39;ve never spoken to before, and that kind of perspective can be really helpful.##

**What is your favorite thing about 19cord or its culture?**
##purple|It feels like 19cord has a certain informality that I really enjoy.  The staff all regularly participate in discussions as members of the community, and I think it&#39;s created a really fun atmosphere.##

**Is there anything else you would like to share that I didn&#39;t ask about?**
##purple|I honestly think you covered everything.##

[[tab BitOddInnit]]
**How would you describe your personal experience on 19cord?**
##green|I&#39;d say it&#39;s been largely good. The community was quite welcoming when I first joined late last year, and I feel like it&#39;s a good place for the community to come together, and I&#39;ve met a lot of really cool people through it.##

**How has 19cord affected your writing?**
##green|Personally? Not that much. Occasionally I&#39;ll have an idea come from an ongoing conversation that may or may not ever see the light of day, but I feel like it&#39;s widely been more of a social tool than a writing one. Not to say that my little experience with the server&#39;s writing channels wasn&#39;t pleasant, I just personally prefer other methods of critique and such.##

**Would you say 19cord is a good place to bring attention to your work on the site?**
##green|I would say so. The Plugging channel is nice for self-advertising, and the Articles To Read channel is nice for bringing attention to the works of others. All in all, I feel like it&#39;ll help people discover new articles in future.##

**What is your favorite thing about 19cord or its culture?**
##green|I&#39;d have to say how open it is. From my personal experience, it&#39;s easy to slide into a conversation and contribute if you want. Nobody ever really gets ignored, and it&#39;s generally a non-hostile environment.##

**Is there anything else you would like to share that I didn’t ask about?**
##green|Ori. That is all.##

[[tab psychicprogrammer]]
**How would you describe your personal experience on 19cord?**
##FE00FF|Post phase 7? Chaotic, there is a lot more conversation to keep track of and the server population has tripled. So we have a lot more newbies to introduce to the culture of the SCP wiki and a bunch of new trolls. On the other hand, the authorbase is willing to cause chaos as usual, its like herding leftists with them.##

**Moderators have different roles on different online communities. What is the role of a moderator on 19cord?**
##FE00FF|Make sure the server doesn&#39;t burn down and kick out the trolls mostly. So far the community has been very good in fostering a positive culture.##

**What steps does the moderation team take to make sure their actions aren&#39;t biased towards or against any one user?**
##FE00FF|Mostly review by other moderators. There are concerns that are significantly discussed about potential biases for certain users, which is very tricky to sort out.##

**What is your favorite thing about 19cord or its culture?**
##FE00FF|Reading club, its just so much fun. Second favorite is how effective the critting process is there.##

**Is there anything about 19cord you would like to share that I didn&#39;t ask about?**
##FE00FF|Yeah, tune into the weekly reading clubs.##
[[/tab]]
[[tab Crow-Cat]]
**How would you describe your personal experience on 19cord?**
###c76a12|Mostly positive. I love being able to talk and listen to other site readers about SCP, on something that isn&#39;t an online message board. I don&#39;t really know any fans IRL, so it&#39;s great to have constant real-time conversations with folks about this site I&#39;ve loved for many years. And most of the people I&#39;ve met in 19cord have been very nice and cool.##

**How would you describe 19cord’s reading club to someone who has never heard of it before?**
###c76a12|Think of it like a podcast or SCP reading channel were you can weigh in on the discussions and/or lend your own voice to the reading. Basically, every week a live reading will be hosted in the server, where we read articles (SCPs, Tales, GoI Formats, Wanderers&#39; Library entries.... even Guides, a couple times) and then discuss them afterwards, with folks listening able to join in if / however they want. The reading club is divided into three timezones: American, European, and Oceania. (Side Note: the division of timezones is only for organizational purposes. Anyone can join any of the reading clubs!) Users can also recommend articles for readings in the club-recommendations channel. If you miss a session, don&#39;t worry about it: recordings of each session are edited by the hosts and uploaded to Spotify. You can find the links to them in the club-announcements channel!##

**Would you say reading club is a good place to find new articles?**
###c76a12|Definitely. It&#39;s also a good place to find underrated or overlooked articles.##

**What makes reading club fun in your opinion?**
###c76a12|Hearing other people&#39;s views on a written piece, getting an opportunity to read stories you haven&#39;t read before, exposing people to stories you like that they haven&#39;t read before, talking about the SCP setting/concepts along with the art of writing in general, banter, etc.##

**What is your favorite part of 19cord, reading club, or 19cord’s culture?**
###c76a12|Being able to talk about SCP with other fans, both readers and authors alike.##

**Is there anything about 19cord you would like to share that I didn&#39;t ask about?**
###c76a12|Nothing comes to mind!##

Each month, community members are encouraged to nominate forum reviewers who have been both particularly helpful and active. Members of the Forum Criticism Team will then discuss the nominations, and select four prominent reviewers to choose the month’s Reviewers’ Spotlight front-page features.
