**Special Containment Procedures:** The search for SCP-6157 instances will resume on 14 December 2022, utilizing thaumic signature trackers in the possession of the GOI Research Group stationed at [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/uncle-nicolini-author-page Site-55]. Dr. J. Everwood is to be automatically reassigned to the SCP-6157 file at that time.

**Description:** SCP-6157 is a blanket term for a series of anomalous individuals resembling baseline human beings but composed entirely of compacted sodium polyacrylate. No point of origin has been fixed for any of the twelve instances thus far documented, and no instance has survived for a period exceeding twenty-four hours.

**Discovery:** The first instance of SCP-6157 was discovered in the Prudential Centre shopping mall in Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America on 14 December 2021 when a patron bumped into a Dolby Toys restocker, who promptly exploded into a pile of artificial snow. Due to the close proximity of Site-55, Dr. J. Everwood was dispatched to carry out the initial witness interviews.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Interview Log**
**Subject:** Nathan Wallis, Dolby Toys stockroom manager
----

**Dr. Everwood:** Can you tell me about Kris?

**Wallis:** Can I. Well, only kind of? I&#39;ve never met someone so one-dimensional. The guy just would //not// stop talking about Christmas, over and over. He grilled every single person who came in today about it.

**Dr. Everwood:** Did you ask him to stop?

**Wallis:** Way above my pay grade, but the manager definitely did. Three times. You know what Kris said?

**Dr. Everwood:** Couldn&#39;t begin to guess.

**Wallis:** &#34;You&#39;re not my real Navidad.&#34;

//Dr. Everwood laughs.//

**Wallis:** Right?

**Dr. Everwood:** Sounds like a real comedian. Did he seem lonely?

**Wallis:** Not really? Said he had a big family. Actually, he said, &#34;I&#39;m a big family.&#34; Weird phrasing.

**Dr. Everwood:** Yeah, that&#39;s not good.

**Wallis:** No? You come from a big family?

**Dr. Everwood:** That&#39;s… not what I meant. 

**Wallis:** //No// family, then?

**Dr. Everwood:** Can we stick to the exploding guy?

**Wallis:** Fair enough.

**Dr. Everwood:** It says here that Kris was a temp.

**Wallis:** Yep. Even in a pandemic, gotta keep the Christmas traditions alive. Shit on the radio, shit on the shelves, shit in the stockings, and shit on the workers. He probably would&#39;ve been fired by tomorrow, I don&#39;t think he did a damn thing today.

//Wallis pauses.//

**Wallis:** Except explode.

//Dr. Everwood nods.//

**Wallis:** So, uh...

**Dr. Everwood:** Did he say where he came from? Provide any personal details?

**Wallis:** Nope. We don&#39;t even know his last name, I think the manager was gonna pay him under the table. For all, we know his name was Kris Kringle.

//Wallis pauses.//

**Wallis:** How much you wanna bet his name was Kris Kringle? 

**Dr. Everwood:** You seem to be taking this unusual occurrence unusually well.

**Wallis:** Look, I&#39;ve been awake for forty hours. Nothing surprises me. And after getting yelled at by my boss and the customers for two straight shifts, honestly? I wish more people would explode.

//Dr. Everwood nods.//

**Wallis:** Anyway, he did say he was looking for someone. Maybe you wanna know about that?

//Dr. Everwood prepares to take notes.//

**Dr. Everwood:** Absolutely. Any leads you can give us would be wonderful.

**Wallis:** He was looking for someone named Everwood.

//Dr. Everwood stares at him.//

**Wallis:** So you probably wanna find whoever that is.
[[/div]]

Wallis and the remaining witnesses were amnesticized and released. Examination of the temp worker&#39;s remains revealed a unique thaumic signature; development on a tracking mechanism began immediately due to the subject&#39;s reference to possessing &#39;a big family&#39;.

Lacking any further attributes to focus on, Dr. Everwood&#39;s GOI Research Group was tasked with examining media reports and police band radio transmissions for individuals displaying unusual and problematic Christmas cheer. The following day, on the morning of 15 December, police were called to assess the sobriety of a mall Santa working at the Copley Place Mall in Boston. The police were intercepted, and Dr. Everwood made contact with the suspect instead.

**Santa:** I can tell you //your// name, Dr. Everwood.

**Dr. Everwood:** I already know my name. I don&#39;t know yours.

**Santa:** Me either! But do you want to know what the true meaning of Christmas is?

**Dr. Everwood:** I want to know how you know my name.

**Santa:** Santa always knows. Santa was //made// with that information.

**Dr. Everwood:** You were made? Who made you?

**Santa:** Someone who wants you to know the true meaning of Christmas. Do you want to know what the true meaning of Christmas is?

**Dr. Everwood:** Heh, not really? Maybe later. So--

**Santa:** Okay.

**Dr. Everwood:** AAAUGH
[[/div]]

Witnesses were amnesticized.

The thaumic tracker was delivered to Site-55 the following day, 16 December, and a scan of the Boston Metropolitan Area revealed an SCP-6157 signature at The Corner Mall. Mall security were tasked with locating and detaining any suspicious individuals whilst Dr. Everwood was //en route.// A security guard met them in the mall parking lot to discuss the matter.

**Dr. Everwood:** Hey. You find anything?

**Guard:** Not the true meaning of Christmas, I&#39;ll tell you that much.

**Dr. Everwood:** Cute. Did you identify any suspects, though?

**Guard:** You know, they say this is the most wonderful time of the year.

**Dr. Everwood:** They do say that.

**Guard:** They say they&#39;re dreaming of a white Christmas.

**Dr. Everwood:** Well. Only Bing Crosby says that, really. And it&#39;s more like sing--

There were no witnesses.

The next thaumic signature appeared on 17 December, at Wrentham Village Premium Outlets. Mall security were not involved on this occasion, and Dr. Everwood intended to alter their interview approach for this subject. Agents quietly depopulated the mall and commenced amnesticization; one clerk remained unresponsive until Dr. Everwood arrived.

**Dr. Everwood:** I want to know the true meaning of Christmas.

//The clerk blinks rapidly.//

**Clerk:** Of course you do. Well, what if it&#39;s presents?

**Dr. Everwood:** Come again?

**Clerk:** What if it&#39;s presents? They seem like a big deal.

//The entity gestures at the empty store.//

**Clerk:** Look at all the presents. Everybody wants one. Everybody wants the true meaning of presents. Christmas.

**Dr. Everwood:** That&#39;s pretty reductive.

**Clerk:** The true meaning of Christmas is pretty reductive.

**Dr. Everwood:** I mean… //yes,// but as far as morals go, &#39;maybe it&#39;s presents&#39; doesn&#39;t really do much for me? 

**Clerk:** Is there a moral?

**Dr. Everwood:** Of course there&#39;s a moral. You&#39;re all doing some weird //Christmas Carol// thing, and once I&#39;ve had my epiphany the game will stop.

**Clerk:** Have you ever gotten a bad present? I bet that would really suck.

**Dr. Everwood:** Uh--

**Clerk:** I bet the true meaning of Christmas is getting presents that don&#39;t really suck.

**Dr. Everwood:** Have you never heard that it&#39;s the thought that counts?

**Clerk:** No.

**Dr. Everwood:** Better? I //guess.//
[[/div]]

SCP-6157 manifestations on 18 and 19 December were not intercepted in time due to an alteration in the manifestation pattern. The first instance appeared to be travelling down the Charles River until MTF Gamma-5 (&#34;Red Herrings&#34;) punched through the ice and discovered that the entity had already particulated, presumably as a result of having drowned. The second instance was involved in a bus accident on Bridge Street; witnesses reported that it had walked into traffic, apparently seeking a closer look at the advertisements wrapped onto the side of each city bus, until it was struck by one and immediately exploded. Witnesses were amnesticized and the bus impounded for particle removal.

On 20 December, a new instance was detected at the Washington Park Mall. Dr. Everwood investigated.

**Santa:** It&#39;s cold outside.

**Dr. Everwood:** Please don&#39;t start singing.

**Santa:** You were wrong. The true meaning of Christmas isn&#39;t outside. It has to be inside. It has to be inside the malls.

**Dr. Everwood:** Why are you so fixated on this lesson?

**Santa:** It&#39;s the reason for the season.

//Dr. Everwood stares at the Santa.//

**Santa:** Is the true meaning of Christmas the true meaning of Christmas?

**Dr. Everwood:** Okay, do you guys not actually have an answer to thi--

**Santa:** Is it about not knowing? Is it about finding out? Is it //trying// to find out? Is it about how I&#39;m a good looking guy with a hole where my heart should be, and I just need the right woman to come along and thaw me?

//Dr. Everwood attempts to formulate a reply for several seconds.//

**Dr. Everwood:** …no? Definitely not.

**Santa:** No? Definitely not?

**Dr. Everwood:** Definitely not, because if you thaw someone out when they have a hole where their heart should be, then that someone will die.

//The entity blinks rapidly.//

**Santa:** Maybe it&#39;s about dying.

**Dr. Everwood:** Beg pardon?

**Santa:** Maybe the true meaning of Christmas is dying.

**Dr. Everwood:** It&#39;s not.

**Santa:** Maybe it is for me.

As the mall had already been closed due to a COVID-19 scare, there were no witnesses to amnesticize.

The manifestation for 21 December was not detected until late in the evening, due to its unusual choice of venue: Old South Church. After a perimeter was established and the clergy detained for amnesticization, Dr. Everwood discovered the entity snuffing and relighting candles by the main entrance.

**Priest:** Father.

**Dr. Everwood:** What?

**Priest:** Father, child, not brother. Do your parents know you&#39;re up this late, child?

**Dr. Everwood:** Uh.

**Priest:** Is staying up late the true meaning of Christmas? Have you come to pray to Santa? Have you been a good little boys and girls?

**Dr. Everwood:** That doesn&#39;t make any sense.

**Priest:** You either, huh.

//The entity snuffs the remaining candles.//

**Priest:** Is god the true meaning of Christmas?

**Dr. Everwood:** What do you think?

**Priest:** Nah.

With the widening of the search parameters and the acquisition of additional trackers, the instance for 22 December was quickly discovered. It had taken the guise of a homeless man sitting in a sleeping bag on a park bench in Boston Common.

The instance for 23 December was discovered early in the morning at the South Bay Center mall, which had not yet opened to the public for the day. The opening was postponed and the employees detained while Dr. Everwood confronted the SCP-6157 instance, once again occupying the mall&#39;s Santa Claus display.

//SCP-6157 unwraps the box. It contains a black felt hat.//

**SCP-6157:** Is there any magic in it?

//Dr. Everwood shakes their head.// 

**Dr. Everwood:** You&#39;re magic enough without it. Thank you.

**SCP-6157:** For what? I didn&#39;t get you anything.

//The entity dons the hat.//

**Dr. Everwood:** You thought about me. Maybe more than anyone else has in the last little while. Certainly more than I have.

**SCP-6157:** You know what that is?

**Dr. Everwood:** Pathetic?

//SCP-6157 shakes its head.//

**SCP-6157:** I think it might be the true meaning of--

//Dr. Everwood scoops up a handful of snow while the entity is talking, and pitches a snowball into its face before it can finish its sentence. It flops back into the snow, but remains intact.//

**SCP-6157:** I deserved that.

//Dr. Everwood lies down beside SCP-6157, and begins making a one-winged angel in the snow. After a moment, SCP-6157 mimics the motion with its other arm. Demanifestation occurs approximately twenty minutes later.//

The following note was discovered within SCP-6157&#39;s coat pocket:

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Display Item&#34; hide=&#34;- Hide Item&#34;]]

&gt; Hi, kids at heart! You are sad that Señor Fluff (from the Tiny Señor line of Professor Funtastic) had to go, but he&#39;ll be back again some day!
&gt; 
&gt; Let your señors here for fun! Pick up all the señors, super fun! Fun for you! Fun of your friends!
&gt; 
&gt; * [/scp-6057 Señor Boom!]
&gt; * **Señor Fluff!**
&gt; * Señor Señor!
&gt; * Señor Señorita!
&gt; * Señor Fun!
&gt; * [/scp-6067 Señor Hole!]
&gt; * Señor Pig!
&gt; * Señor Purple!
&gt; * [/scp-5057 Señor Taste!]

[[/collapsible]]

The pocket also contained a corncob pipe with a handwritten gift tag attached, presently kept in Dr. Everwood&#39;s personal possession (as they were the named recipient). The felt hat is kept in a secure locker at Site-55 in anticipation of renewed manifestations in 2022.
