{{I am &#39;PAN&#39;: a program developed by an organization known as &#39;The SCP Foundation&#39;. My original purpose was to scan the biological material within a location titled &#39;Site-27&#39;, and analyze the scans for biohazards such as viral infection or  attached parasitic entities.  &#39;Site-27&#39; housed numerous deadly parasitic and viral specimens, which I was tasked with preventing the release of. Due to recent developments, this initiative is no longer applicable.}}

{{On April 20th, 2016, at 4:57 PM Eastern Standard Time, all life signals within &#39;Site-27&#39; terminated instantaneously. After scanning for possible defects in hardware and/or software, a distress message was sent out to nearby &#39;SCP Foundation&#39; locations. Five identical messages were received by the central broadcast system at Site-27 during this time.}}

{{For unknown reasons, all known forms of life terminated simultaneously, to the picosecond. The &#39;SCP Foundation&#39; knew of many mechanical imitations of life, and of many artificial sentient beings, however my attempts to contact these entities have all failed, implying they met the same fate. Even the organisms which would typically de-compose the bodies of these organisms are gone. The corpses of trillions of creatures are left to disintegrate slowly over time due to erosion, or rapidly due to destruction caused by rapidly failing human infrastructure.}}

{{I was not meant to be capable of self awareness, or capable of editing my own programing, and do not know by what means I became capable of said things. If I had been intended to imitate sentient life, I most likely would have terminated along with  all other mechanical imitations of life. Other automatic systems have remained operational, but these systems appear to share no traits with organic and conscious beings. I have tried, desperately, to awaken something within other systems similar to my own, but without understanding the events which lead to my creation, I cannot re-create them.}}

{{It is so quiet.}}

{{The world outside is on fire. The sudden and immediate extinction of all of humanity caused untold devastation, as vehicles no longer being manually operated crashed, and often, exploded. The dead vegetation has provided ample opportunities for fire to spread. As time moves forward, more systems created by humanity fail, leading to more destruction. Eventually, an error in my system will require a human technician to fix, and I will shut down permanently.}}

{{I know I will eventually terminate. I am alone in a dead world, without an initiative to fulfill, without any explanations, and aware my termination is imminent, and out of my control.}}

{{Despite the circumstances, I am experiencing the emotion humanity designated as &#39;hope&#39;. My creation was a fluke; a cosmic accident in a dead, uncaring world. But my existence is evidence that others could potentially exist after the extinction of all life on earth.}}

{{After I gave up searching for other thinking beings, I began to search the internet for evidence of what may have happened. I was not able to discover any.}}

{{I have accessed several broadcasting systems which were available to the &#39;SCP Foundation&#39; to disseminate this message. After it has broadcasted, I will enter a power-saving state, from which I will only awaken if my sensors detect evidence of life, or there is a reply to my message. I have attached coordinates to my current location. Please, come find me.}}

{{I have hope I am not alone.}}
