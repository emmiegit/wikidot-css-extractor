{{**Title:** //A Tragedy For the Ages// by Quinton Elliots}}

{{**Material Requirements:**}}
* {{Daniel Dunn. (Already in my possession, don&#39;t worry about sending someone.)}}
* {{Nolan Bushnell&#39;s 1967 Chevrolet Camaro Z-28, bought and sold by the man himself at the dawn of ##purple|Arcadia&#39;s## heyday. Don&#39;t refurbish it, if it looks like it&#39;s seen nicer days, all the better.}}
* {{A human femur, whittled to a knifepoint. I don&#39;t care whose it was. Better that way.}} 
* {{As much cocaine as your boys can find, preferably more than fifty kilos of the stuff to be appropriate. Throw in a couple bottles of good Cognac while you&#39;re at it.}}
* {{##purple|Arcadia&#39;s## &#34;client book&#34;. If they&#39;re still the same guy I worked with back in &#39;81, the Critic should know where to find it. I want to know I&#39;ll get an audience.}}
* {{One of [[[Chicago Spirit|the Mob&#39;s]]] &#34;special bombs&#34;. I want to blow something straight to Hell with no questions asked on the receiving end.}}
* {{A camcorder. (Also something I already own.)}}

{{**Intent:** I remember the day ##purple|Arcadia## died.}}

{{I think I&#39;d always known in the back of my mind it was never going to be sustainable. All the drugs and booze and little bonuses you&#39;d get once you walked into a bar. We were heroes, upper management. Dunn even let us go [[[Four Sides of the Same Imaginary Coin|hog wild with our little personal projects back in the early eighties]]] once we had the men in black behind us again. I was a demigod, Critic. Have you ever walked into a room and had everyone turn to look at you? To be awestruck that you&#39;re even walking beside them? I have, and it&#39;s intoxicating. ##purple|Arcadia## gave me that.}}

{{So you can&#39;t imagine how awful it was once Dunn&#39;s little self-righteous morality kick left us dead in the water. He fired me on the spot, y&#39;know, after I walked into work plastered. I was one of the lucky ones, though. I never really left. Kept on trundling as an under-the-table consultant right until we finally collapsed in &#39;89. The damage was done, though. We weren&#39;t heroes anymore. Just a gang of fucked-up losers hooked on whatever the latest designer drugs were.}}

{{Critic, you should have been there once the new CEO told us we were dead to the world. He looked at me like I was a nobody again. The way they always looked at me before. It was awful. We ended with a bang so insignificant it may as well have been a whisper. Now, that&#39;s not right, Critic. With your help, I&#39;ll make sure ##purple|Arcadia## dies the way we always lived.}}

{{Covered in blood and high off our asses in an orgy of violence and liquor.}}

{{**Abstract:** Sometime soon, I am going to take Daniel Dunn out of the back of my car.}} 

{{I&#39;ll lock him in the driver&#39;s seat of Bushnell&#39;s old Camaro, done up in all its rusty, tacky glory. Then we&#39;ll share one last bottle of Cognac, like the old times. Maybe do a bit of cocaine. I doubt it though, ol&#39; Danny&#39;s been clean since &#39;85. But it won&#39;t matter, the car will be loaded with the stuff anyway. Just like in the old days.}}

{{I&#39;ll stab the book a couple of times with the bone, let our creditors know I want to see them one last time. I&#39;ll tell them whose fault it was that we screwed them over. I want the devils to know ##purple|Arcadia## doesn&#39;t go back on deals. I want them to have Daniel Dunn served up on a silver platter so they know who really fucked them over this time.}} 

{{Once I&#39;ve got an audience? Simple, I blow the car straight to Hell with Dunn inside. Let the old creditors fight over him. With that, we can start the real work. I&#39;m going to bring ##purple|Arcadia## back from the dead. I want to be a hero again, Critic.}}

{{I&#39;ll give you the tape and you&#39;ll play it in every gallery.}}

//What the fuck?//

//This isn&#39;t art, Elliots, this is a glorified snuff film.//

//Not only is this &#34;artpiece&#34; extravagantly fucked up; it would also cost us an insane amount of money to buy what you want. And for you to get your rocks off in your disturbing little revenge fantasy. There&#39;s nothing here for// us //to gain at all here. By the time you&#39;re reading this, I&#39;ve probably come around to my senses and made an anonymous tip to the feds about you having Daniel Dunn in the trunk of your car.//

//Sorry, we don&#39;t exactly go around throwing money to every sociopath willing to commit murder in the name of &#34;art&#34;.  And unlike the old Critic, I&#39;m not going to help you out due to old company ties. Want our funding? Make art worth looking at.//

//Piss off, Quinton. Don&#39;t write back.//
