We will hold hands
While we scip to Gehenna
You in mine
And mine in yours

We stand at no height
There is no sight
In the land where there is no day or night

[[/div]]

The air hung silently as Agent Mavet and Agent Eris sat in the dry and stuffy conference room. Mavet steadily taped his foot. Eris stood and gazed at a picture of the northern night sky.

&#34;Space is such a headtrip isn&#39;t it?&#34; Eris&#39; voice cut the silence.

Mavet tiredly nodded his head and then announced, &#34;I really wish Davis would hurry,&#34; he checked his watch, &#34;I have a study session soon.&#34;

Researcher Davis entered the conference room, &#34;Thank you for be--&#34;

Mavet interrupted, &#34;Why did you call us here?&#34;

Davis coughs uncomfortably, &#34;I want to test two operators using [[[SCP-5746]]]-1 simultaneously,&#34; he answered as he set a stack of files down, &#34;There is nothing in the containment procedures against it and there have been no recorded tests of this nature.&#34;

Eris faced Davis, &#34;Will Mavet and I be the operators?&#34;

Davis hands Eris a dossier, &#34;Yes, but I don&#39;t know who&#39;s astral plane it is that you two will traverse,&#34; he passes a folder to Mavet.

&#34;That&#39;s what tests are for,&#34; Mavet said while standing from the chair, &#34;Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;m going to be late,&#34; he grabbed the dossier and left.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

We will hold hands
While we scip to Gehenna
You in mine
And mine in yours

We embrace
Under the worn red Giant&#39;s face
We wander and pace
Silent, we at Gehenna&#39;s base

[[/div]]

Agents Eris and Mavet prepared to lay on the gurneys in SCP-5746-1. The body scanners hummed quietly. The openings meant for the gurneys stretched open like a maw.

&#34;Aren&#39;t you concerned about this test? At all?&#34; Mavet adjusted his headcap.

&#34;Not really,&#34; Eris replied.

&#34;This hasn&#39;t been done before,&#34; he replied.

Davis&#39; voice crackled over the speakers, &#34;Are you having second thoughts Mavet?&#34;

Eris nudges Mavet, &#34;It&#39;ll be fun to experience what happens,&#34; they winked and laid down.

Mavet sighed and also laid down.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

We will hold hands
While we scip to Gehenna
You in mine
And mine in yours

In darkness we are surrounded
Aimless we walk around
A sewage mound
No rest in our journey will be found

//[Visuals start in darkness. Coughing recorded on audio indicate sound works.]//

**Eris:** //(coughs)// --the hell are we? It smells.

**Mavet:** We might //(coughs)// we might actually be in Hell.

//[A Red Giant emerges on the visuals. Latter analysis by Foundation astronomers shows that the Red Giant emerged from behind a dark absorption cloud. The light from the star does not illuminate the landscape around the agents.]//

**Eris:** There&#39;s a giant sun and I still can&#39;t see for shit! Why is it so hot?

**Mavet:** //(whispers)// I think we might be in Gehenna.

**Eris:** A what?

**Mavet:** A Hell.

//[The sun is noted to not move. Feed et al go to static for approximately a minute. Upon its return Mavet and Eris are in mid-conversation. Due to the agents&#39; demeanor, it is assumed that substantial time passed.]//

**Mavet:** --have you visited Florida?

**Eris:** No?

**Mavet:** Well don&#39;t. Or do. Do, if you want to feel real heat.

**Eris:** What if I want to visit Disney?

**Mavet:** //(laughs)// That&#39;s an awful choice to make.

**Eris:** I haven&#39;t been.

**Mavet:** It&#39;s not worth it, it&#39;s worse than this.

**Eris:** We&#39;re on an astral plane consumed by a giant star, and you&#39;re saying that a location on //(emphasised)// //Earth// is equivalent to Hell?

**Mavet:** No. I&#39;m saying it&#39;s worse than Hell.

//[Static. On return feed and audio is distorted.]//

**Eris:** I spy with my little eye something red!

**Mavet:** //(silence)//

**Eris:** I spy with my little eye something large!

**Mavet:** //(sighs)// The red star?

//[Static.]//

**Eris and Mavet:** //(singing out of tune)// One bottle of beer on the wall! One bottle of beer! Take one down pass it around! Nine-hundred and ninety-nine million, nine-hundred and ninety-nine thousand, and nine-hundred and ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall! 

**Eris and Mavet:** Nine-hundred and ninety-nine million, nine-hundred and ninety-nine thousand, and nine-hundred and ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall! Nine-hundred and ninety-nine million, nine-hundred and ninety-nine thousand, and nine-hundred and ninety-nine bottles of beer! Take one down pass it around! Nine-hundred and ninety-nine million, nine-hundred and ninety-nine thousand, and nine-hundred and ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall!

//[Feed returns to static for five minutes. Visuals return; warped they show the star in an unidentifiable light spectrum. The colour is later discovered to be a low class cognitohazard.]//

**Eris:** //(mumbling)// ...no light and yet this isn&#39;t even darkness. The piercing light of that star hurts my soul.

**Mavet:** Like looking into an eye.

//[A loud screech cuts audio. Visual cuts to static. When audio returns, a low hum is recorded. Visuals return and there is a rectangular object in front of agents Mavet and Eris emitting red light.]//

**Mavet:** //(astonished, gasps)// &#34;G-d is my shepherd&#34;

**Eris:** Finally! Something! //(sobs)//

**Mavet:** //(quietly and urgently)// --through the door!

//[Agent Eris runs through the doorway. They are followed quickly by Agent Mavet. Bright light overexposes visuals as audio cuts. Agents Mavet and Eris return to baseline reality.]//

**Davis:** Hello Mavet, I came to wish you a speedy recovery and to thank you for your work.

**Mavet:** I appreciate that. I&#39;ll recover OK. Eventually, this migraine will feel like it came from a bad cold.

**Davis:** It feels like a migraine?

**Mavet:** //(nods)// I&#39;ll recover. However, you need to understand, that you have to be cautious. Understandably, Agent Eris and I are trained for these things; however, The Hell, the afterlife, the astral plane we walked into could&#39;ve been unfathomably worse.

**Davis:** I understand and I&#39;ll keep this in mind. I&#39;ll leave you to rest now.

**Mavet:** Good. And thanks!
