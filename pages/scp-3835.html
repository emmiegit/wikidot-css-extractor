**Item #:** SCP-3835

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** No individual Foundation agents are to occupy SCP-3835 for longer than fourteen consecutive hours. Personnel are not permitted to re-enter SCP-3585 until such time as their blood has a tetrahydrocannabinol level of no more than 2.5 ng / mL. Personnel assigned to SCP-3835 are to remain under the influence of at least 200mg of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) for the duration of their shift. MTF Delta-20 (&#34;Blaze It&#34;) is to patrol the perimeter surrounding SCP-3835 under the guise of local forest rangers.

Varying strains of THC are provided upon request. 

**Description:** SCP-3835 is a non-Euclidean[[footnote]]A location with dimensions that exceed the exterior of the building in which it is contained.[[/footnote]] Papa John&#39;s Pizza located within a pollard beech tree in Catskill, New York. While normally imperceptible to the human eye, a door leading to SCP-3835&#39;s interior can be accessed while subjects are experiencing the effects of THC. 

The interior of SCP-3835 resembles a non-anomalous Papa John&#39;s with one major difference; all windows, save for the small window within the door leading to the interior, are covered with bark. Pizzas prepared within SCP-3835 are comprised of wood, pine sap, and an unknown substance that are combined and physically transmuted within the on-site oven, though the exact nature of how this is accomplished is unknown. These pizzas, once processed, are indistinguishable from non-anomalous Papa John&#39;s brand pizza and can be purchased using non-anomalous currency or through bartering with an SCP-3835-1 instance. 

SCP-3835-1 instances are green bipedal entities averaging a height between 0.9 and 1.2 meters. All SCP-3835-1 instances wear attire identical to that of standard-issue Papa John&#39;s uniforms. SCP-3835-1 instances are capable of speaking both English as well as an unknown, consonant-heavy language. 

**Interview SCP-3835-1 &#34;Tristan&#34;**
SCP-3835 was discovered by Junior Researcher Umar Hadid during his leave of absence following the [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5967| Post-Containment Incident]]]. He was awarded a Greenhead Explorer Award and was granted permission to document the anomaly before returning to his leave. 

Junior Researcher Hadid entered SCP-3835, accompanied by an armed escort comprised of members of MTF Delta-20. Upon the completion of his order[[footnote]]Which included a large Hawaiian pizza, among other unusual items.[[/footnote]], an SCP-3835-1 instance agreed to an interview during its allotted break period. The following interview has been attached below.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]
**Interviewer:** Junior Researcher Umar Hadid

**Interviewed:** SCP-3835-1

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**J.R. Hadid:** Alright dude, can you uh...

**SCP-3835-1:** ( //Speaking an unknown language// ) 

( //There are several seconds of silence. Junior Researcher Hadid coughs several times and sniffles.// ) 

**J.R. Hadid:** You. Name, please.

**SCP-3835-1:** Horith Ramos of House Valkayn. You&#39;ve asked me that six times now.

**J.R. Hadid:** Sorry, I&#39;m a little... cloudy. 

( //SCP-3835-1 nods and leans back in its chair. It pulls out a pocket knife and a small, semi-carved statue from its pocket and begins whittling. Delta 20 Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Echo take their seats at the adjacent table and observe SCP-3835-1. J.R. Hadid coughs and shakes his head.// ) 

**J.R. Hadid:** What are you doing?

**--Horse-- SCP-3835-1:** What, never seen a goblin whittle on his break before?

**J.R. Hadid:** I mean what are you doing //here// in this //fucking// tree?

**SCP-3835-1:** Running a Papa John&#39;s.

( //J.R. Hadid leans his head back and sighs.// ) 

**J.R. Hadid:** Look man, I&#39;m just trying to get some work done so can you //please// give me a straightforward answer.

**--Horith-- SCP-3835-1:** Let me ask you this, buddy. Why are //you// here? In our place? You and your friends got your pizza, you got your interview, got my name, what else do you want?

**J.R. Hadid:** An explanation. 

( //SCP-3835-1 scoffs.// ) 

**SCP-3835-1:** For what? It ain&#39;t my business what you business affairs you pursue. Why are you so nosey?

**J.R. Hadid:** We&#39;re scien- we- we&#39;re scientists. Are you safe?

( //SCP-3835-1 hands the now completed wooden sculpture to Delta 20-Alpha, who hands it to Beta. The sculpture animates and proceeds to move in a rhythmic manner that would suggest it is dancing. Beta, Gamma, and Echo are laughing. Alpha&#39;s attention remains focused on SCP-3835-1.// ) 

( //J.R. Hadid attempts to signal to Alpha but is unsuccessful. SCP-3835-1 frowns, pulls out a small block of wood and begins carving into it.// ) 

**SCP-3835-1:** You know, what&#39;s funny? We were safe for a //long// time before you got involved. Those [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1000|hairy fucks]]] tried to wipe us out centuries ago. Our [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/taboo|cousins]]] //graciously// closed the well off before we could escape into the forest. Left us on this side of the shit show. 

**J.R. Hadid:** What happened?

--**Hoith-- --Horse-- --Horith-- SCP-3835-1:** They stole our names and fled, that&#39;s what. We had to improvise. By the time the big boys figured out where we went, well, they were too mellowed out to do anything about it. Couldn&#39;t stay focused long enough. Eventually, after enough of &#39;em went missing, we were at peace.

**J.R. Hadid:** Was this always ( //He coughs// ) a Papa John&#39;s?

**SCP-3835-1:** No. But times changed. Your kind likes their pizza, and my kind aims to deliver. Unlike DiGornio.

( //J.R. Hadid laughs. SCP-3835-1 does not look up from its wooden carving.// ) 

**SCP-3835-1:** And, you know after a while we stopped hearing from folks. Stopped seeing those behemoths. Stopped hearing from our friends and family. Started gettin&#39; hungry. 

**J.R. Hadid:** What&#39;d you do?

( //The initial statue returns to SCP-3835-1 with four wallets. Beta, Gamma, and Echo laugh. Alpha continues to stare as she consumes a slice of Hawaiian pizza. SCP-3835-1 stores the wallets in its pant pocket.// ) 

**SCP-3835-1:** Made deals with the locals for food, money to buy food, construction efforts, you know how society works. And now...

( //SCP-3835-1 sets the second statue on the table between it and J.R. Hadid. The second statue becomes animated and rolls tetrahydrocannabinol residue within a napkin. Using anomalous means, the statue lights the end of the rolled napkin before handing it to J.R. Hadid.// ) 

**SCP-3835-1:** ( //Rifling through the content of the wallets.// ) Well, we all make a living somehow.
