**Item #:** SCP-1741

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Area-1741 has been constructed as the primary research and containment facility for SCP-1741 and is surrounded by a three meter high fence with a 300 meter radius centered around SCP-1741-A. Civilians are to be deterred under the guise of private property, and any non-Foundation personnel found within the containment zone are to be given Class C amnestics and released.

Remote surveillance via D-17412 is to be monitored at all times the equipment on D-17412&#39;s person has power. After a Wake event, personnel are to debrief D-17412 on the current situation. Exploration goals, which can be found in file 1741-ELG, are to be given at this time.

**Description:** SCP-1741 is the collective designation for a series of anomalies centered around an indestructible two meter tall brick shack (designated SCP-1741-A) located on the bank of the [REDACTED] river in southern Louisiana. The door of SCP-1741-A cannot be opened. The interior of SCP-1741-A is only visible when the window is opened by the humanoid (SCP-1741-C) within. When this occurs, the second anomalous property of SCP-1741-A is revealed; volume of the interior is vastly greater than the exterior appearance of the building should allow. Visible contents of SCP-1741-A resembles an establishment colloquially referred to as a soda fountain, with the window acting as a drive-thru window despite most such establishments lacking one.

SCP-1741-B are several aquatic vehicles surrounding SCP-1741-A. SCP-1741-B instances are stylized as different marine animals, all in various states of disrepair. Should instances of SCP-1741-B be removed from a eighty meter radius from SCP-1741-A, a new instance of SCP-1741-B will rise from the bottom of the river.

SCP-1741-C is a male humanoid of European descent, dressed in zoot suit. SCP-1741-C possesses no visible anomalous anatomy, though it does not appear to require nourishment and does not age. SCP-1741-C will attempt to sell boat rides to anyone who approaches SCP-1741-A. An instance of SCP-1741-B will spontaneously self-repair for each human who purchases a ride, the price of which is three dollars. The newly repaired SCP-1741-B will drift to the riverbank until the customer boards.

Should a customer travel more than eighty meters from SCP-1741-A, the repaired SCP-1741-B will ram itself into another instance of SCP-1741-B and sink from the subsequent structural damage. Only one human is permitted per instance, and if more than one attempts to board, the SCP-1741-B will break apart. SCP-1741-C will not provide a refund for ships damaged in either of these ways.

When a customer successfully boards, SCP-1741-B will autonomously travel down the river, disappearing from visual surveillance after approximately twenty meters of movement. Remote surveillance remains active, revealing the SCP-1741-B transports the customer to an archipelago of variable number[[footnote]]Testing has revealed that the number of islands is dependent on the number of humans on the archipelago, currently four.[[/footnote]] of islands located outside of conventional space[[footnote]]Due to the suddenness of this transport, researchers have been unable to classify this spacetime anomaly, though similarity in activation to [[[SCP-2539]]] suggests it may be a variation of a Class-3 inter-dimensional portal.[[/footnote]]. Each island holds a designation of SCP-1741-#, and each exhibits a unique anomalous characteristic, available in the table below. The instance of SCP-1741-B will crash upon the shore of the newest island, and sink.

||~ Island ||~ Anomalous characteristics ||~ Occupant, Year ||
|| SCP-1741-1 || Spacetime anomalies are prevalent throughout SCP-1741-1. Source of Wake Events. || No known occupant ||
|| SCP-1741-2 || SCP-1741-2 is inhabited by a series of featureless humanoids. All humanoids are extremely violent, but do not possess excessive strength. || Jean-Paul Dumas, a French soldier. 1801 ||
|| SCP-1741-3 || Airborne amnestics appear to be present in the atmosphere of SCP-1741-3. All fruit grown on SCP-1741-3 are apples, the consumption of which combats the amnestics. || Arthur Smith, a Catholic priest. 1954. ||
|| SCP-1741-4 || Majority of SCP-1741-4 is an expanded market filled with featureless humanoids selling and purchasing various goods using an unknown currency. This market is the only source of edible resources on SCP-1741-4. || D-17411. 2003 ||
|| SCP-1741-5 || SCP-1741-5 contains a sapient anomaly that claims to be a god. The anomaly does not appear to have a physical form, only appearing as a large shadow cast independent of the sun&#39;s light. || D-17412. 2003 ||

A Wake Event is a large-scale spacetime anomaly centered around the archipelago. The start of a Wake Event requires an instigator to activate a device on SCP-1741-1. A Wake Event will cause the arrangement of the islands within the archipelago to be randomized. All occupants of the archipelago are instantly returned to the instance of SCP-1741-B they arrived on, with all but the instigator of the Wake Event having lost all memory of the previous &#34;session.&#34; All SCP-1741-B will then crash onto their respective islands.

&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-1741-C
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Agent Cruz
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** The window of SCP-1741-A opened when Agent Cruz came within twenty meters, SCP-1741-C attempted to gain his attention by yelling and waving.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1741-C:** Hello there, friend! My name is Alan Pearce, and I&#39;ve got a great offer for you! Can I interest you in a boat ride? Real cheap!
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Cruz:** Maybe. I was wondering if you could answer some questions for me.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1741-C:** Fire away, bud.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Cruz:** How long have you been operating here?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1741-C:** Uh... Honestly, I couldn&#39;t say. A long time. What year is it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Cruz:** You don&#39;t know the year?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1741-C:** The door is locked. I cannot unlock it. And this window is way too small for me to get through.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Cruz:** You&#39;re trapped.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1741-C:** That I am, friend.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Cruz:** It&#39;s 2003.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1741-C:** Oh, wow. Uh... Well, I found the shack back in 1946. Dunno how long I&#39;ve actually been running it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Cruz:** You&#39;ve been here for almost fifty years?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1741-C:** Well, not exactly. It... I can&#39;t really get into too much detail. Confidentiality. My, uh, &#34;employers&#34; don&#39;t allow me to talk too much about it. I&#39;ve been here a long time, alright? Too long, in my humble opinion.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Cruz:** Can you explain how you&#39;ve managed to survive for that long?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1741-C:** Eh... Lemme think, I gotta word this right or I&#39;ll catch hell for it. Somebody, a... um... I guess a potential coworker? &lt;SCP-1741-C braces itself, and continues after two seconds&gt; ...Apparently I can say that. Said there&#39;s some timespace shenanigans going on. I don&#39;t age so long as I&#39;m in here. Don&#39;t need to eat either, though I have all the grub I could want in here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Cruz:** You said you have coworkers? I don&#39;t see anyone else in the restaurant.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1741-C:** &#34;Potential&#34; being the key word. They&#39;re, uh... still in the application process.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Cruz:** How does one apply?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1741-C:** That I can&#39;t say, I know that. Um... Really, mac, if I keep jawing this much I&#39;m gonna say something I shouldn&#39;t. Care to buy a boat ride?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Cruz:** How much?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1741-C:** Only three dollars!
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Cruz:** Boat ride to where? This isn&#39;t a very deep river. And all your boats are broken.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1741-C:** It&#39;s a mystery! Part of the adventure. You&#39;ll see some sights, heh, I can promise you that. Hooboy, yeah, you will see some things. And don&#39;t you worry about the boats, I got that covered. So, interested?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Cruz:** Perhaps another time.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1741-C:** I get you. The cautious type, don&#39;t want to pay for something if you don&#39;t know exactly what you&#39;re getting. Well, I&#39;ll be here if you change your mind. Tell your friends! Always happy to see new customers.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Background study has revealed that Alan Pearce went missing in 1946. SCP-1741-C physically resembles Alan Pearce, though no conclusion has been made whether SCP-1741-C is truly Alan Pearce or the SCP-1741 anomaly is mimicking him.

**Foreword:** After the disappearance of D-17411 and her SCP-1741-B, it was decided to attempt a second experiment using remote surveillance equipment attached to the participating D-Class.

&gt; Camera activates. D-17412 is sitting in an instance of an octopus-stylized SCP-1741-B as it travels down the river at a slow pace. SCP-1741-B navigates river to avoid other instances and debris within the river. D-17412 looks to Agent Cruz, who is walking along the riverbank abreast of the boat. Agent instructs D-17412 to remain calm and to prepare for the teleportation event, and to attempt communication after said event.
&gt; 
&gt; After twenty meters, visuals instantly change. Instance of SCP-1741-B is now in a calm ocean, heading toward an island containing a coniferous forest. A large stone tower is visible above the treetops. Other islands of the archipelago are visible, but obscured by fog. SCP-1741-B shakes as if striking something. D-17412 leans over edge of boat to confirm jagged rock formations. SCP-1741-B strikes another rock, breaching the hull. SCP-1741-B begins taking on water. D-17412 questions whether camera is waterproof. When HQ confirms the camera is waterproof, D-17412 abandons ship. D-17412 swims to the shore, consisting of a sandy beach. D-17412 watches SCP-1741-B sink before entering the forest.
&gt; 
&gt; D-17412 continues in the direction of the stone tower. Fragments of ruins are spread across the forest floor, each piece depicting unknown runes. D-17412 enters a clearing, in the center of which is the stone tower covered in runes. Although the sun is on the opposite side of the tower, it does not cast a shadow over D-17412. D-17412 walks a circle around the tower, confirming it does not cast a shadow in any direction. D-17412 exits clearing, periodically turning to use the stone tower to maintain a sense of direction.
&gt; 
&gt; Three hours after leaving the clearing, D-17412 falls to the ground. Camera vision is obscured, shouting from both D-17412 and an unknown male is heard. Camera is removed from D-17412&#39;s person. A Caucasian male centers the camera&#39;s view on his face and speaks in a French accent.
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Well, hello. Yet another newcomer dressed in orange. Only this one brought toys. In order to get off the archipelago, you have to complete a test specific to your island. Unfortunately, your boy here already has made a series of mistakes. I suppose he didn&#39;t read his brochure.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Male drops camera and departs. Blood, presumably D-17412&#39;s, can be seen pooling at the edge of the camera&#39;s vision. No further activity until the equipment runs out of power.

All exploration logs can be accessed by all personnel with clearance for this article; however, Exploration Logs 02-11 will be redacted from this document for the sake of brevity. These explorations were used to outline the islands&#39; effects in the table above. During these logs, D-17412 found a brochure in his SCP-1741-B instance. This brochure encouraged readers, under the guise of being part of a tour, to visit the stone tower when the sun was directly above it.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Exploration Log 12 Excerpt&#34; hide=&#34;- Close EL12&#34;  hideLocation=&#34;both&#34;]]
&gt; Camera activates. D-17412 is standing in the clearing, ten meters from the stone tower. A large circular shadow is being cast from the tower, shading D-17412. Although no sound is detected by the surveillance equipment, D-17412 claims to hear a voice. D-17412 repeats the word &#34;Decalogue&#34; several times before deactivating the camera.
&gt; 
&gt; Camera activates after twenty-two hours. Camera vision turns to the corpse of D-17412, who is now clothed in dark blue robes. The hand of the person wearing the camera searches the body. The person, who then identifies themselves as D-17411, removes the stone prism from D-17412&#39;s pocket. She explains she found D-17412 dead, and she is required to steal his trinket. HQ briefs D-17411 on the apparent temporal anomalies surrounding the archipelago. D-17411 acknowledges this information and then deactivates the recording equipment.
&gt; 
&gt; Camera activates after thirteen hours. D-17411 is standing on a plateau overlooking SCP-1741-1. It is unknown how she managed this, as attempts in previous logs were met with failure. She turns to face a pedestal, the top of which resembles a clock with a small stud in the center. She places her hand on the stud and presses.
&gt; 
&gt; Footage instantly changes to the perspective of D-17412 in his SCP-1741-B, approaching SCP-1741-5.
[[/collapsible]]

**Addendum:** On 05/08/2005 the door of SCP-1741-A opened, and SCP-1741-C exited the building. The door shut without any further interaction. Foundation personnel captured SCP-1741-C, who did not resist. The window of SCP-1741-A then opened, revealing D-17411. The interior of SCP-1741-A now resembled a typical fast food restaurant, with various television sets displaying footage of the human occupants of the archipelago. D-17411 has been designated SCP-1741-C-2, the former -C designated SCP-1741-C-1. SCP-1741-C-2 declined explaining how it entered SCP-1741-A. It then offered to sell the questioning agent a boat ride.
