**Special Containment Procedures:** The area comprising all previous 5634 territory is to be monitored for reports of SCP-5634-2 entities, which will be dealt with by the appropriate Foundation authorities. 

[[collapsible show=&#34;Open 5634-Revision-1&#34; hide=&#34;Hide 5634-R1&#34;]]

//The following revision was used from 1891-1930.//
----
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5634 is to be allowed total and complete autonomy unless otherwise stated. Any civilians attempting to enter SCP-5634 will be pressured away from SCP-5634’s perimeter by force under the guise of border security. Any SCP-5634 residents found outside of the nations borders will be forcefully returned to their respective homes in SCP-5634.
----
[[/collapsible]]

**Description:** SCP-5634 was a self declared nationstate comprised of the townships of St. Joseph, Felson, and Neche in Pembina County, North Dakota, USA. SCP-5634 existed for a period of 37 years (1893-1930) under the name “The Agrarian Union of Neche”, in which time it was able to create its own currency, military, and government. Residents of SCP-5634 henceforth referred to as SCP-5634-2, gradually became anomalous in nature during the period in which SCP-5634 existed, assumedly due to breeding with the anomalous (assumed to be) native inhabitants of SCP-5634. Anomalous effects vary widely but consist mainly of physical mutations, which include an unexplainable level of strength, speed, and polymelia (primarily in the legs and arms). Many of these effects harm those effected in some way, causing average anomalous inhabitants of SCP-5634 to live for an average of roughly 40 years (according to documents written by SCP-5634’s physician Douglas Olson, see //Addendum-5634-I//).

[[size larger]]**Declaration of Independence**[[/size]]
,,of the Great Agrarian Union,,
[[/=]]

We the people and workers of Neche, Saint Josephs, and Felson collectively declare independence from the false and backward &#34;Union&#34; of States whom continue to swipe the rights of the agrarian and of the people, due to the crimes mentioned in this document, which this council hereby claim to be an irredeemable and unforgivable offense even to the lord above.

**List of Unforgiveables**

* The taxation of the worker to a degree most unfavorable and illegal.
* The attacks by Union forces due to our acts of retaliation which we do deem to be right with God and with the rights previously bestowed to us by your false articles and douments.
* The deaths of over twenty just south of Neche.
* The imperialistic actions of the Union in the Dakota area, primarily the conflict with the Sioux.
* The imperialistic actions of the Union outside of the Dakota area, namely Korea, Mexico, and other areas where fellow agrarians were slain.
* The clear prosecution of those with traits unique to that of the average man, some of who had been members of this very council.
* The “confiscation” of hunting rifles, pistols, and other tools explicitly kept for self defense (which were keenly permitted by your articles).
[[=]]
//(List continues for 2 more pages, for details see Document 5634/Miscellaneous/LoU.)//

With this document we declare ourselves independent, and in a state of war with the false States of the Union.

The following document is a medical report written by Douglas Olson. The public unveilment of this document led to a surge of “anti-unique” activity, and boosted “anti-unique” political parties. These parties would eventually win an election in 1928 with candidate Robert Gibson, who took almost dictatorial power of 5634-society within a year.

**A-5634-I (“Medical Report for National Census of 1910”)**
[[/=]]

The population of the greater Neche area is 4,081 as reported by the census. Unique number nearly 25% of the nation now.

I have made a worrying discover, a potential link between the disease plaguing our young, and the unique.
Those with unique parents are commonly born with multiple digits and other birth defects. It seems something is genetically off with them beyond their positive traits.

I request we take a further look into this.

Signed,

D. Olson

**The Act to reverse the Decisions of April 27th, 1899, December 3rd, 1905, and July 19th, 1919**
[[/=]]

The acts of protection for the unique are blatantly illegal, alongside the undoing of these decisions, the Vlachian Democracy Front is banned by this act for its illegal and evil dictatorial acts against the Union. The following terms now apply:

* All acts for the protection of unique people are hereby void.
* Enforced segregation from uniques is completely lawful and necessary.
* Unique members of government are to be relieved of their positions by the 15th of July, 1929.
* Marriage between unique peoples and normal peoples are now forbidden to halt the expansion of their disease.
* Any attempts at resistance by Unique politicians will be met with swift action.

This act has passed with unanimous agreement.

April 6th, 1930

Freaks, the lot of them. 
Why did the populace not understand I was trying to protect them from those things, those abominations, those godforsaken freaks. The Union is embroiled in a great civil conflict, and with the United States becoming involved, I know that the great Agrarian vision has come to an end.

I’ll be visiting Gerald now Susan.
