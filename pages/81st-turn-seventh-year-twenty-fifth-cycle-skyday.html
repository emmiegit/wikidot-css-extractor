+++ From the Journal of Aframos Longjourney, Pilgrim
+++ With notes by Avos Torr, Scholar of Rheve Library
+++ Skyday, Twenty-fifth Cycle, Seventh Year, 81st Turn
++++ Ninety-second Day in the Trees

We continue to push through the forest. We have yet to return to the path.

I have a new appreciation for paths and roads. Not only are they far easier to walk on, they show us which direction to go, or at least //a// direction to go. A path must lead somewhere, or it would not be a path.

We do not know where we are going. If I knew the stars of this place, I could navigate that way. But even when I can make them out between the branches, I can&#39;t see any of the constellations I am familiar with. I did not know that it was possible to travel so far that the stars changed, but I appear to have managed it.

Torne said that other travelers on the path have told him that any time they left the path, they still returned to it after a few days, which was comforting. Or it was, until he added, &#34;But those who never found the trail would not be met so sound and hale.&#34;

Regardless, we have no choice but to keep moving. We will not find our way by standing still[[footnote]] If you are lost in the woods, it is normally best to stay in place so you can be found by rescuers. However, this assumes that rescuers are searching for you. Also that you are not being hunted by something that wants to eat you, or worse, sell you magazines. [[/footnote]].

We made our camp in a hollow formed by a fallen tree that was massive in life. Three Baro could have lain head to food on the stump and stretched out comfortably. A bend in the crooked log made a comfortable shelter.

We have made no fire, and as the sun sets, it will soon be too dark to write anymore.</textarea></pre>
