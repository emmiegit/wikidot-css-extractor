**Nash Pinkle&#39;s Guide to the Foundation**
**Author:** [[*user CityToast]]

The tale that is 8 years in the making. This tale is based on a conversation I had in 2012 over IRC with one basic premise: How can you explain concepts about the Foundation //badly//...but //correctly//? 

It started with tags, moved on to SCPs, and even Foundation staff. I apparently kept a list in a notepad file that&#39;s been sitting in my documents folder since then, and I stumbled across it this week while looking at old SCP files on my laptop. Enjoy.

Thanks to [[*user Croquembouche]] for CSS help.

//Nash Pinkle was a facilities specialist employed by the SCP Foundation. Though his employment has recently ended, he did express interest in becoming a Foundation researcher, and at one time attempted to submit the following “guide” as a body of research work for review. It remains here for archival purposes only and **should not be used for reference**.//

&gt; &#34;Someone wouldn&#39;t really use this for reference, now would they?&#34;
&gt; &#34;...&#34;
&gt; &#34;Don&#39;t look at me like that. Please don&#39;t tell me someone used this for actual reference.&#34;

Nash Pinkle’s Definitive Guide to --Amono-- --Anemo-- --Anime-- Weird shit
[[/div]]

Ello, I’m Nash Pinkle. And this is my guide to the different kinds of weird shit at the Foundation. See, all o these things can be grouped into “groups”, or “[http://05command.wikidot.com/tech-hub-tag-list another word for groups]”, that you can define by asking one simple question: **wot if?**

&gt; &#34;But?&#34;
&gt; &#34;But like...I feel like I understand the subject matter better now. I feel ashamed.&#34;
&gt; &#34;We all do, doctor. We all do.&#34;
