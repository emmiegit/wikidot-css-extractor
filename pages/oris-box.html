@@ @@

I go by a few names, but call me Ori! I&#39;m an author specializing in dialogue, scripts, and character-driven narratives. Most of my stories that I consider to be my best work are focused around the characters involved rather than the stakes of the situation. As a result, my work tends towards interpersonal conflict and slice-of-life style structure. That said, I&#39;m trying to push my limits and try new things. Not everything works in the end, but that&#39;s the joy of creating art isn&#39;t it? 

I don&#39;t have a specific source of inspiration. Sometimes I&#39;m inspired by a song lyric, sometimes I&#39;m inspired by a local urban legend, and sometimes the idea comes to me like visions from an angry god while I&#39;m stuck in traffic. All I do know is that I try to maintain a consistent setting and somewhat consistent cast of characters. As of right now, all of my articles exist within the same canon for whatever that&#39;s worth to you as a reader!

* [[[SCP-7999]]] **Meet Me in the Stars:** As of writing this is my longest work on the site. I also sincerely believe it to be my best work on site. I never expected to enter a kcon, but somehow the theme of luck clicked just right with an idea I already had in development. A lot of my work as an educator involves showing kids why the world we live in is actually a really cool place. Sure humans are flawed, but we have a lot to celebrate. This piece is the SCP equivalent of that- showing the audience the wonders of our world through the eyes of the alien Carteckan. If there was a single article of mine I&#39;d tell people to read to understand my style and voice, it would be this one. 

* [[[SCP-7373]]] **&#34;Screamy.aic:&#34;** I&#39;ll be honest I had no idea how to follow 7999 up. I wasn&#39;t sure I even //could//. That said, a little screaming fellow I originally worked on with some friends popped back into my mind, and next thing I knew Screamy was on the page. This is a story about doing your best, getting squelched by people in power, and LARGE RATS. It&#39;s also just an opportunity to flesh out Site-58 further, so woohoo!

* [[[SCP-5828]]] **&#34;As in Life, So in Death&#34;:** My very first article. Tells the story of an angry ghost and explores how media/popular perception of people can twist a narrative. Deals with themes of emotional manipulation, so be warned in advance. I actually went back and overhauled this one not too long ago. I mostly wanted to make it more in line with my modern writing style, but honestly I was surprised with how little I wanted to change about the article from a fundamental point of view.

* [[[SCP-5372]]] **&#34;My Gift to You, Oh Love&#34;:** A simple story about a gay couple in the 50&#39;s and the cave that hid their love from the world. It&#39;s a short read, but one of my personal favorite works of mine.

* [[[SCP-5469]]] **&#34;Winnie&#39;s Diner&#34;:** I don&#39;t think I can say anything on this that wasn&#39;t already covered by my author&#39;s comment. My first truly character focused piece, with a story told almost entirely through dialogue. I visualized this almost like a stageplay, and I think that was to its benefit! This took a long time to write, and I&#39;m extremely proud of the final product.

* [[[SCP-6033]]] **&#34;The Friend With Many Arms&#34;:** A fun romp mixing some of my artwork with a wholesome story involving a boy and his monster. This was the originator for that idea of using some really sketchy, kiddie style artwork as an emotional core to an article. 

* [[[SCP-6404]]] **&#34;My Name is Your Name and Your Name is My Name&#34;:** My first real &#34;horror&#34; article, and something WAY out of my normal style. I wasn&#39;t planning to hop on the shortform article trend, but I got hit with an idea that&#39;s perfect for it. If you like fridge horror, this one&#39;s for you.

* [[[SCP-6968]]] **&#34;Fantastic Fearsome Critters&#34;:** This is my love letter to good old American folklore. Have you heard of the Jackalope? The Fur Bearing Trout? Well this is me putting them in SCP form, with some deeper commentary on the treatment of animals when money is involved. 

* [[[SCP-6103]]] **&#34;As Stars Fade&#34;:** I&#39;m a believer in writing things that come from a personal place. Personal experiences, fears, memories, etc. are a wonderful source of inspiration and help create works that are sincere and real. That&#39;s what this article is for me, as it draws inspiration from my own family experience with dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s. 

* [[[SCP-6498]]] **&#34;The House of Bones&#34;:** My first contest entry! I wrote this for Nightmarefest 2021 under the &#34;Graveyard Shift&#34; category. A continuation of the Faraday story, we get to see a bit more of Agents Goose and Bluejay as they explore a haunted house alongside Agent Sparrow. Lots of bones in this one.  

* [[[SCP-6059]]] **&#34;HAVE YOU EVER HAD AN ENLIGHTENED EXPERIENCE IN A BALL PIT?&#34;:** My first attempt at a &#34;funnyman&#34; article. This article was a few months in the making, and was a real challenge to get right! I think that the comedy it has works, and it has some of my best dialogue at the time of writing. 

* [[[SCP-6619]]] **&#34;Birthing Pains&#34;:** This is the SCP equivalent of a traumadump for me. It reflects a particularly traumatic experience I had several years ago involving intestinal pain and emergency surgery. Looking back at that experience, I wanted to write something that conveyed exactly what I felt during that process. That became the mpreg body horror story you see today.

* [[[SCP-6621]]] **Los Niños que Comieron Maíz Crudo:** Another DepartmentCon entry for my team. We wound up not qualifying, but I was glad just to have written at all. This was actually my first SCP concept ever, but it went through a massive overhaul during the contest to become what it is now. It is an adaptation of an old, obscure Mayan legend translated into a more modern setting. I&#39;m very proud of it, and hope that you enjoy it!

* [[[SCP-6506]]] **La Muñeca Quitapena:** Working towards my goal of adapting Mesoamerican culture and mythology into the Foundation multiverse, another Mayan legend served as my inspiration here. The Guatemalan Worry Doll, or Muñeca Quitapena, is a small cloth doll that is designed to remove stress and worry as you sleep. Here she is Ixmucane, and she helps Dr. Ash Joydevor as they explore the dreams of a coworker to figure out where her worries come from. I wrote the entire thing in a single sitting, but I am extremely happy with the final product!

* [[[SCP-7904]]] **A Very Gävlebocken Christmas:** A goofy article written for Coldpostcon 2023. Got no review before posting, but came out well enough. I aimed to spoof Hallmark Christmas movies a bit with a queer focus. This is more comedy focused than my usual works, but was an opportunity to give Caraway a chance to shine as a lead. 

* [[[SCP-7679]]] **Journey for Belonging: The Death of Chuck Storms:** An introduction to the main plotline of my Dreamscape stuff! While several of my other articles feature gods from the Dreamscape, this is the first one to really delve into it and explore the concept and conflict. Just a fun adventure story featuring magic and an asshole crow.

* [[[SCP-7374]]] **Ever Marching Forward:** Written for Goblincon 2023. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not ideal to work on two major storylines at the same time (sounds like a great way to ensure neither gets done), but I finally had an idea of how to follow SCP-7999 up. This is our first step, watching Dr. Parker and learning just how far she&#39;s willing to go to leave her mark on history.

]]

**Agent Basil Sias:** A member of the newly formed Department of Anomalous Ambassadors, Agent Basil Sias is the Foundation&#39;s go-to man for anomalies and situations that require sensitive communication and diplomatic engagement. He&#39;s smart and charismatic, and is the kind of person who others open up to quickly. While the Foundation often uses this to their advantage, Agent Sias does seek to form as many legitimate relationships with the people he meets as possible. At the end of the day his goal is to ensure that people are happy and healthy, and he&#39;ll do whatever it takes to achieve that.

His life was forever changed once he met a bright-eyed alien named Carteckan. After a short time together, he&#39;s made it his life&#39;s work to find a way to contact the Keradids so that we might meet again. Now known as Ambassador Basil Sias, he begins work in earnest to shoot humanity into the space age. 

Agent Sias is currently seen assisting with [[[SCP-5828]]], [[[SCP-6033]]], [[[SCP-6103]]], and [[[SCP-7999]]].  Check them out if you want to see him in action!

]]

**Dr. Faran Caraway:** The Vice Chair of Site-58&#39;s Department of Zoological Studies, Dr. Caraway is one of the anomalies integrated into the Foundation&#39;s personnel through the Integration Program. A shapeshifter and a contained anomaly himself, he works hard to prove that anomalous personnel are an asset to the Foundation. While his main job is in the study of anomalous animals, the Foundation does regularly use him on missions where his shapeshifting would prove an asset. 

He&#39;s a relatively anxious man, eager to please and eager to impress. He feels that his performance reflects on the rest of the Foundation&#39;s anomalous personnel- him failing would in effect being them all failing. He tries to hide it, but the weight of that expectation weighs heavily on him.

Dr. Caraway can be seen in [[[SCP-6968]]], [[[SCP-7904]]], [[[SCP-7073]]], and in the background of [[[SCP-7373]]]. He can also be seen in [[[the-graduating-class-of-58 | The Graduating Class of Site-58]]]
