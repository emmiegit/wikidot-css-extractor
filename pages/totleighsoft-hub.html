//&#34;Letting TotleighSoft take care of our social media design was the best decision we&#39;ve made in years. Their rates are low, they finished way ahead of our deadline -- and best of all, everyone who looked at our website died of a sudden, aggressive brain hemorrhage! Our secret is safe. Thanks, TotleighSoft!&#34;//

//&#34;As we violently shove the breakable bodies of our collective psyche through the two-inch hole that is technological progress, we here at Vikander-Kneed have just two words about how it was made possible: Totally. Soft. Because 1. that&#39;s what TotleighSoft sounds like, and 2. only through their digital guiding hand could we have been molded into something soft enough to break through to the other side. Thank you for keeping us adaptably flaccid.&#34;//

//&#34;I have just received word that we have abolished analog forever. We begin the downloading in five minutes. TotleighSoft attached its meaty appendectomies upon the nerves of my scalp and all the wheedling bagpipes of children&#39;s digestive systems ring out their droning refrain through the glade. Lubricate your RAM chips before giving Mr. Gorbachev my regards.&#34;//

&gt; 
&gt; &#39;sup, y&#39;all. It&#39;s your old pal Daveyoufool, breakin&#39; the fourth wall all over your binch faces.
&gt; 
&gt; Look, I&#39;m not about to tell you that there&#39;s a set in stone format for TotleighSoft. That would imply Mr. Gock knows what he&#39;s doing.
&gt; 
&gt; Instead, I&#39;ll tell you that there are just two cardinal rules to work around:
&gt; 
&gt; **1. P. Hudson Gock is not evil.** He&#39;s not &#34;good&#34; in any sense of the word, but he has no ulterior motives for running this anomalous software corporation. His moral philosophy is a combination of three things: 1. a hasty back-jacket description of the American Dream, 2. an unknowable eldritch alien apex predator&#39;s idea of &#34;fair competition&#34;, and 3. extreme naivete &amp; dumbassery. In his own ham-fisted way, he genuinely wants to use anomalous consumer electronics to help Americans help themselves.
&gt; 
&gt; **2. TotleighSoft&#39;s borken engilsh shulod be stil recoganzible enugoh to be red.** The most effective way of doing this is to rearrange the letters in a word while still keeping the first and last letter. (Also, Mr. Gock never spells TotleighSoft or his own name incorrectly.)
&gt; 
&gt; Other than that... have fun.
