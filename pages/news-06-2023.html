Last month, the wiki was graced with not one, but two contests! One official, one not; GoblinCon and RomCon specifically.

GoblinCon&#39;s theme (or themes, as it would be!) deals with the infamous slot goblins which plagued our site a few years ago. For the uninitiated, slot goblins are broken SCP slots that could not host an article due to Wikidot&#39;s technical flaws. However, that was corrected, and the slots were opened back up on the anniversary of the first slot goblin being discovered. The themes of GoblinCon were Class of 76, Glitches, Fantasy Goblins, Battle Royale, and Deletions. You can find the winners and the entries [[[goblincon|here!]]]

[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/collab:slice-of-life-festival/judas-min.png]]

The second contest, Romcon, is exactly what you expect from the title; a Romantic Original Character Tournament! Sign-ups were initiated near the beginning of May and over 40 entrants signed up. The first round of the contest finishes June 4th, and the next round of matches will be decided by the matchmaker, [[*user UraniumEmpire]]. You can read all the entries [[[romcon|here!]]]

+++ Reviewers&#39; Spotlights

Works are featured on the site’s front page as part of the Reviewers’ Spotlight, which acknowledges the time and effort spent by forum reviewers helping other authors develop and edit and their works for the mainsite. Each month, community members are encouraged to nominate forum reviewers who have been both particularly helpful and active. Members of the Forum Criticism Team will then discuss the nominations, and select four prominent reviewers to choose the month’s Reviewers’ Spotlight front-page features.
