**Item #:** SCP-6171

**Clearance Level:** Level-4

**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** A group of moderately trained guards are to guard the area around SCP- and any civilians to stumble across it are to be given anesthetics immediately.

**Description:** SCP-6171 Is a hallway-like rectangle box with concrete floors and walls, inside are gun cages and shelves with a large amount of weaponry, appearance ranging from 1288 to the modern day, there are also modern looking weapons that haven&#39;t made yet and weapons that look like it would be from some kind of alien planet or super futuristic weapon. Some of weaponry found to range from devastatingly deadly to very underwhelming, some reports say some weapons couldn&#39;t even kill a fly. The weapons in SCP-6171 range from guns to melees, some can even range to explosives.

When a weapon from SCP-6171 breaks, the weapon will reappear a few minutes later when atleast one piece is put back in it. The weapons --of already existing weapons-- seem to have their own anomalous traits, as they interested differently with SCP-417, --but these traits are still in the process of being completely found-- the weapons also have the anomalous ability to hit anomalys that most normal weaponry would go through.



The location of SCP-6171 is in an abandoned military base in Nevada, near Ely, despite the base never having records of being built or even existing. --The weaponry are only limited to one of each and cannot be duplicated-- When a weapon is taken, they will reappear after a certain amount of time, which varies depending on how powerful the weapon is, from 30 seconds to a month.




**Note** &#34;//Because of an event in// **[REDACTED]** //D-class personal are not to carry out tests with SCP-6171-2 instances, we can&#39;t afford having a D-class almost escape like last time, Ely was completely// **[REDACTED]**&#34; -████








__**Test A - Date ██/██/████**__

&gt; **Subject:**
&gt; **[DATA EXPUNGED]**
&gt; **Procedure:**
&gt; Doctor Robert raised one of SCP-6171&#39;s guns, the gun appeared to look like a futuristic sci-fi movie gun, with a tag on it that says &#34;Railgun&#34;, Doctor Robert raised the gun at a D-class that had entered the room to get shot, he pulled the trigger and what fired from the SCP-6171-2&#39;s barrel seemed to be a thick lazer beam, the D-class exploded, making blood and pieces of flesh splatter everywhere in the room, what remained of the D-class was his head, forearms, and his waist, which was almost destroyed completely.
&gt; **Results:** 
&gt; A powerful weapon added in many MTF squad&#39;s arsenal, a four hour of janitorial staff scrubbing off flesh and bones off the wall, floor, and ceiling, and a hole in the wall that took seven minutes to repair. Further testing with this railgun will be stopped, there is no need to test it any longer.
&gt; **Analysis:** 
&gt; From the outside the beam from the railgun traveled about a entire football field before suddenly stopping.
&gt; **Extra Notes**
&gt; Any other further tests have been classified to the O5 council.
