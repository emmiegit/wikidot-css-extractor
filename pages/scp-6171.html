**Special Containment Procedures:** Documentation regarding SCP-6171 is known to appear spontaneously in administrative databases. Staff are reminded that said documentation is authentic, and was already present. Please preserve all relevant documents for use in this file.

Per Antimemetics Protocol §7.17, level X-1 mnestic medication therapy is prescribed for all personnel assigned to SCP-6171.

**Description:** SCP-6171 is the former community of Grace, an abandoned town in southern Fremont County, WY. Lingering anomalous effects have made complete investigation of the area difficult, but several key details have been ascertained.

* At its largest, the town was home to several thousand people.
*  Sometime prior to 12 Jan 2018, an unknown memory-suppressing phenomenon (likely an antimemetic effect[[footnote]]A phenomenon which makes objects and ideas more difficult to remember; see [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/antimemetics-division-hub full documentation] for details.[[/footnote]]) blocked all Foundation awareness of the city.
*  By the time of full rediscovery on 12 Jan 2018, the community&#39;s entire population had vanished.

SCP-6171’s memory-affecting properties began to fade in late 2017, leading to a “cognizance cascade” whereby various Foundation sites gradually became aware of unfiled archival materials referencing the town. However, the exact nature of Grace, as well as the reason for its obfuscation, have yet to be ascertained.

As relatively few entities are capable of deceiving the Foundation on a city-level scale, investigation of SCP-6171 has been prioritized; MTF Delta-12 (“All Around In The Dark”) is indefinitely assigned to the area. A range of possible explanations is being considered, including:

* Hostile action by an antagonistic individual or Group of Interest
* Purposeful obfuscation by the Foundation itself for the purposes of containment
* Accidental fallout following a breach by an unknown anomaly housed in the city

Initial exploration by MTF Delta-12 suggests that the abandonment of Grace was not spontaneous, but occurred gradually. Investigation also has yielded a series of documents, many of which remain partially obscured by the memory effect. Digital analysis has somewhat ameliorated this, and a log of recovered documents from around the Foundation is presented below in order of discovery.

&gt; Name: Petrovic, Anja T.
&gt; Age: 13
&gt; Height: 157cm
&gt; Weight: 61.1kg

&gt; Conversed with subject for several minutes and found her a polite, if unremarkable, young woman (though very late for her appointment, which we had to rush). States she maintains active relationships with several family members and friends. Physical health unaffected. Diet unaffected. Social activities unaffected. Subject reports lingering depression, anxiety; medication prescribed.

&gt; //Sara is proving wonderful to work with. Hasn’t mixed up my name once since the first day, and takes such interest in all of us. Today she even CORRECTED ME about something I’d miscategorized in a file. I haven’t felt so normal in weeks. It’s like being back at -19 again.//
&gt; 
&gt; //I wish I could say the same for the others, though. I had to ask for help five times at the doctor yesterday before they took Anja back. It isn’t their fault, so I shouldn’t feel bitter, but I can’t help it. I know my girl. She’s the furthest thing from forgettable.//
&gt; 
&gt; //...I&#39;ve also had this lingering sense the last few days. Like there&#39;s someone around me all the time. It&#39;s how you feel when you have family upstairs, versus how you feel alone in the house. Odd.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Best not to dwell on it. Winona is visiting next month from -19 to go over our progress on——haven’t seen her since she visited us in the hospital. She’s the only one who ever really loved getting into the nitty gritty of the data with me, and I’ve been missing that. It’ll be a joy to see——.//

&gt; 
&gt; Making decent progress on getting everyone into the automated catalogue. That won’t necessarily resist the fading, but it can at least be a backup. 2,900 residents down and just a few dozen more to go.
&gt; 
&gt; Truth be told, I’m not sure I can keep up with this. It’s… bleak. That’s the nature of the job to begin with, working where we do, but I haven’t had the full burden so squarely on me before. My partner keeps suggesting taking some time away. It’s tempting, but I can’t risk it. Someone who knows how to remember the refugees has to keep being here.

&gt; Grace Community School District
&gt; Student: Petrovic, A
&gt; 14 September 2014
&gt; 
&gt; Anja has been a confident student and a responsible presence in our classroom. Though she does not speak often, her thoughts are always clear when she chooses to participate.
&gt; 
&gt; Anja sometimes has difficulty turning in assignments on time. She told me she is unable to focus for more than a few moments on certain days. Unfortunately, I lack the time and training to offer direct support, so I’m recommending that she and her parents have a conversation with one of our counselors about seeing a specialist. For now, I am happy to extend deadlines for her work.

 _

&gt; We expected that keeping track of everyone who we transported———difficult, but I’m happy to say everything seems to be going smoothly so far. I’m not aware that anybody has been neglected, and our systems are alerting us of noteworthy changes in personnel routines and activity at all times. ——all are accounted for. I&#39;m proud of my team&#39;s accomplishments so far.

&gt; //I&#39;m worried I said something to upset Sara. I stopped by the front office today to see if my orders for the lab finally showed up. For some reason, it seemed like she didn&#39;t want to see me. Looked sideways at me when I walked up and pretended (I think?) not to hear my ring the first time. Once she had a good look at me inside she seemed to warm up to me, and she&#39;s never been anything but friendly before. Pretty sure I did something thoughtless last time I swung by. I&#39;ll have to think about it and apologize.//

 _
 _

&gt; Milan and I finally got to sit down and go over our findings today. It was the first time I’d seen him in person since he got hurt at -244. The poor man… He has an awful scar, and his left arm is still in a sling. He told me about a visit I’d paid him in the hospital after his injury, and I didn’t have the heart to argue with him. I didn&#39;t visit. But there’s no sense in correcting a man with memory damage just to say you did.
&gt; 
&gt; That aside, Milan seemed to have the details of his work straight enough in his head. Too much so, if anything! Kept pressing on minutiae that simply aren’t relevant to the project. I tried to be patient with him, but in truth he always has been this way. Too much energy for his own good. We called it quits after a few hours and I’m not convinced we got a single thing done for all that time. Milan seemed happy, though, so he must have gained some clarity that I did not. Headed back to -19 tomorrow and trying not to feel a little relieved!

&gt; //They nearly locked me out today.//
&gt; 
&gt; //I’ve walked at the same time of day, every afternoon, since August. Routine helps things stick. Once in a while, when there’s been a new guard or something, I’ve had to run my ID. But they always let me right past after that.//
&gt; 
&gt; //That happened again today, but this time the ID scanner wouldn&#39;t read my card. Tried it for three minutes with no dice. Guard was getting real suspicious. I just started naming people, sites, everything I could think of to show I’m not just some stranger or crook. Guard said ok, what’s the name of the town we’re in?//

&gt; Issue: Anja never comes to class. It&#39;s been three weeks since she turned in any work. When I confronted her this afternoon, she lied to me about attending every day and having permission to turn in work late due to a disability. I have no record of anything like that, and I know she has not been in class.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m sending this note home hoping dad can have a talk with his daughter about her habits. At Anja&#39;s age, school has to be a priority.

&gt; **Preliminary report: G———, WY**
&gt; 
&gt; ——begun my investigation into the “fading effect” observed in the personnel we brought to Grace in the wake of the Site-244 incident. Notably, all of the victims have been accounted for and successfully rehoused, which suggests to me that we aren’t dealing with a typical “antimeme” that totally obliterates memory. We CAN remember this people—there doesn’t seem to be any question about that. The question I want to answer now is: why do we seem to keep forgetting them anyway?

&gt; 
&gt; //She could barely see me before she left. She hadn’t slept more than a few hours, that much was clear. I could tell she felt sick, was just being polite to whatever she thought I was. What was I supposed to do, demand she put us over her own health? I couldn&#39;t do it. After everything she&#39;s done for us she deserves at least that much regard.//
