**Item #:** SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO

**Object Class:** Uncompliant

**Special Containment Procedures:** An O5 vote will be conducted to determine whether or not retrieval of SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO is worth the trouble.

**Description:** SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO is a //Dudleya greenei//, located and grown within a ceramic pot. Any photograph taken of SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO is automatically licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0. This is recognized by all individuals who view SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO, including those without prior knowledge of the object. This does not result in an understanding of what CC BY-SA 3.0 is, or what it means. No sapient being has proven to possess any knowledge of CC BY-SA 3.0. There have been multiple hypotheses as to its meaning, which are presented below:

* Cack cack! By Yaldabaoth, so acidic!
* Criminal cases bring yams southside, Adam.
* &#34;Cry, Caroline!&#34; &#34;But you said &#39;Ahoy&#39;!&#34;
* Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike[[footnote]]This has been deemed the least likely meaning of CC BY-SA 3.0. Like seriously, where does Attribution fit in?[[/footnote]]
* Cupity co, Bipity yee, //slimer ass//.

There is one individual who may possess knowledge of CC BY-SA 3.0, O5-7. However, instead of answering to Foundation queries, he merely rocks back and forth in a fetal position, breathing through his nose loudly.

It has been determined that SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO can be used in any way, shape, or form with no repercussions. Thus, the Department of Theatrics has performed multiple shows of //My Plant Pam//, based off of the book of the same name[[footnote]]©Elaine Marlin Chevrolet 2019-∞, All Rights Reserved[[/footnote]] focusing on SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO. Further adaptations are proposed.

SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO was discovered via a photo posted on Wikimedia Commons by the account &#34;stnalp_looc_repus_2020&#34;[[footnote]]Account now deleted[[/footnote]]. Upon tracking of the account&#39;s IP address, SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO was found in a dumpster behind a Denny&#39;s. Attached to the object was a sticky note, which read &#34;haha bitch totes cc by-sa 3.0&#34;. This was quickly discarded, along with the Denny&#39;s, for having no worth to the investigation into CC BY-SA 3.0.

Research into newly discovered GoI-2001 (Creative Commons) is ongoing.

**Addendum CC-BY-SA-3.0-CO-1: Larceny**

On Apr. 1, 2020, a bandit entered SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO&#39;s containment cell and stole the object before de-materializing. Afterward, a piece of loose-leaf paper was found stranded on the containment cell&#39;s floor, which read as follows:

&gt; You fucks,
&gt;
&gt; You actually thought that was under Creative Commons? The image that clearly had //Copyrighted █████ ███ All Rights Reserved// watermarked on the fucking //top//? I&#39;m fucking done. Image removed.
&gt;
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt; ██-█

**Addendum CC-BY-SA-3.0-CO-2: O5 Vote**

In a 12-1 decision, it has been determined that SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO **//##green|is##//** worth the trouble of retrieval. God bless the Foundation. The one dissenting O5 member, O5-7, made the comment below:

&gt; I try to fix things, and you MESS THEM ALL UP AGAIN.
