+ Editorial
[[/div]]

If you were at all paying attention to the Site last month, you probably noticed it was a very busy one. Not only was there a [[[halloween-con-2022|Halloween contest]]] for both prose and art, but there was also a month-long [[[scp-anthology-hub|anthology series]]] hosted by user //S D Locke//, well-known provider of spooks and scares! For the uninitiated, SCP Anthology was a month-long horror-fest of SCP articles posted by mystery authors hosted by Locke and Estrella.

Since you already heard about the Halloween contest in last month&#39;s editorial, we figured it would be interesting to talk to Locke and see what she had to say about SCP Anthology. Let&#39;s hear about anthology from past me and Locke!

What inspired you to create SCP Anthology?

&gt; In terms of hard inspiration vs like “why” I chose to do it (as there’s some distinction there), I’d have to credit Kalinin’s 2798/001, and Kaktus’ Way it Ends, both of which took a serialized approach to content — and both of which were incredibly exciting to experience in the moment. I made a post in the Anthology group chat around the time of 7kon’s announcement that elucidates on this. I’ll be adding some commentary to the hub once I have time to elaborate.
&gt; 
&gt; To explain “why” I decided upon the size/scope: during last year’s Harbinger 2, I had a lot of requests to do another anthology and a lot of folks who felt either overlooked or who felt like they missed out. Stretching it to 31(+) works allowed me to be more inclusive, while also allowing me to work directly with a bunch of people I otherwise wouldn’t have.


I was involved in the process of writing for SCP Anthology, you mentioned it was like herding cats at some point. Do you think you will ever try something this large again?

&gt; If I do something like this again, the model would be changed significantly, perhaps allowing for days to be skipped if a deadline is missed or an author drops out, to save on desperate last-minute scrambling. Given that this fulfilled its month-long promise, I don’t think I’ll be so particular to have a perfect record in the future. And I sure as hell won’t start it 10 months in advance.

 
The letter X notably had 4 entries posted, and there were a few other X-word titles on LC the day that the first X article was published. What lead to this situation?

 
&gt; For X, it was a last-minute Hail Mary to put out an open call for authors. Once again following from my first answer, I wanted to be able to include as many people as I could since there were about a dozen prospective entries. I settled on 4 because I figured I could do something with the letter itself, which Estrella was able to incorporate into the hub itself in a really cool way.
&gt; 
&gt; As there could only be so many selected even with expanding from 1 to 4 articles, I had to pick and choose. Some were unfortunately not up to par — owing mostly due to the short amount of prep time and hard constraint for theming a story around a word beginning with X.
 


Do you think SCP Anthology achieved its goal?

&gt; I think so. The promise was daily horror SCPs from different authors, and we achieved that (even though one was not posted… though we had 2 SCPs 2 days in a row for a total of 33 anyways). We managed to see both new and returning authors from across the entire history of the site, and all in all, everything more or less fell into place.


Have a free plug! Which of the articles is your favorite?

&gt; Isabi’s [[[scp-7470|M is for Moonlight]]]. In my opinion, the scariest entry of the bunch

And there you have it! Thank you Locke for answering my questions and thank you to all the other SCP Anthology contributors who helped make this October a haunting one!

++ SCP Wiki Art Exchange 
[[/=]]

November 15th marks the start of the Annual Art Exchange for 2022. The first recorded instance of the SCP Wiki Art Exchange was in 2012 on a [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-596596|forum post]]] made by the user //Djoric//. Djoric explained in their original post that they were inspired to create the Art Exchange from a similar activity they had participated in on the MSPA Forums, believing it would be a fun tradition to bring to the Wiki. It is the Wiki&#39;s version of Secret Santa. 

The Art Exchange is a project where authors and artists of all different mediums are presented with the chance to share their creativity with their fellow Wiki members by creating artwork, crafts, SCP Articles, tales, stories, songs, videogames, etc for them. Generally, works are expected to be related to SCP in some way. Works can be of the chosen person&#39;s articles characters, or even just of an SCP or SCP character created by another author that they enjoy. 

One can sign up for the Art Exchange by filling out the form on the current year&#39;s announcement of the gift exchange. It is important to always look at the rules and keep in contact with the members in charge of the art exchange so no rules are broken and everyone has a fun time. To see the history of Art exchange projects, [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art-exchange-hub|check out the Art Exchange Hub.]]]
