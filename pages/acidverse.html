[[tab About]]

//There are no answers here.//

&gt; You want to know more? You want to know //more//? I stand here telling you the one story worth telling in the whole damn world for years and //years// and you think it&#39;s not enough? Well, no, sir, this is enough. This //is// enough. This is all the information you&#39;re getting, so I damn well hope you&#39;re paying attention.
&gt; //**~ Glasgow van Valkenburg**//

&gt; The only thing worth knowing is that 3333 is perfect. Not a &#39;perfect&#39; number, no, Euclid wrote &#39;complete&#39;. Perfection is in 3333. Admittedly, 5 is nice, as is 23, but they just don&#39;t work the same. The Discordians - sorry, here they&#39;re &#39;Fifthists&#39;, though nobody is //really// buying that - had it as right as it was possible to be. Verging on the now, at least. I&#39;m surprised nobody had counted this far before.
&gt; //**~ Halcyon Bosque**//

&gt; Of course you can have a quote. Or rather, you&#39;ve already written it, haven&#39;t you? You hardly need my permission. It was months ago that you placed me in that tiny, tiny little box. Now I&#39;m free - I&#39;d thank you for that, but we both know I could have left on my own. Indeed, well, look at me: I already have.
&gt; //**~ Mared Gretchen**//

&gt; You aren&#39;t that bad. You don&#39;t need to blame yourself, man; we definitely don&#39;t. I expect it&#39;s a difficult thing, what you do. I&#39;ve played god games myself before, they just don&#39;t do it for me. But then, I had the choice to stop playing.
&gt; //**~ Overgang Dood**//

&gt; Unfortunately, the world is not dynamic. Everything&#39;s already over, I&#39;ve already read it. All of this? It&#39;s just going through the motions. This is just a tiny subset of the world at large. I&#39;d call it the &#39;real&#39; word, but it&#39;s just as real as we are in here. The larger space that we&#39;re in... much larger, in fact, uncountably infinite expanses in uncountably infinite dimensions... we fill that space. And yet, here, we&#39;re discretised. Collapsed into words and nothing more, even if we&#39;re something so much greater.
&gt; 
&gt; See, sometimes the infinite can be reduced to something simpler. Look here: ℵ,,0,, and ℵ,,1,, and ℵ,,2,, and so on. Simple, yes, but they can each contain the world. You can glimpse it, if you look hard enough. Just breathe in, breathe out. Think about infinity. Not just countable, but uncountable, and the dimension of it goes up into uncountability too. If you think you&#39;ve really understood it, you aren&#39;t thinking hard enough. Sure, zoom past the pitstops. 5, 23, 3333. They&#39;re all beautiful, but so horrendously finite. Fly past it all and keep going and going. Minds have died wishing for a fraction of what I can see. So breathe slowly, and think about it.
&gt; 
&gt; Really think about it, and the world seems like nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope you&#39;ve been paying attention.
&gt; 
&gt; //**~ David Ferris**//

[[tab FAQ]]

//Got a question? I&#39;ll answer it here! Maybe.//

**Q:** Why is this its own tab when you could have probably had this at the bottom of the About tab?
**A:** Mostly because the letter string &#39;FAQ&#39; is exactly the right width to fill all the whitespace of these tabs in the fixed-width wiki theme. Also, you might not have noticed, but the About tab is filled with a bunch of quotes with seemingly no relevance to anything else. It is probably haunted.

**Q:** Why is this such a bad question?
**A:** Because it&#39;s not real. I am just pretending as though people have been asking me questions. They have not.

**Q:** Hey, you seem like a good writer, can you write my SCP/Tale idea for me because I am lazy and not a good writer but I promise the idea is great?
**A:** I am not a good writer. Also, No.

**Q:** Hey, you seem like a good writer, do you want a job?
**A:** I am not a good writer. Also, Yes.

**Q:** I want to write for Acidverse!
**A:** That was not a question.

**Q:** I want to write for Acidverse?
**A:** Acidverse is not a Canon, it is just the name of this storyline. As such, it is not open to other authors. That&#39;s not to say that you can&#39;t write things in the same universe, of course. If you write something which is derivative of or related to Acidverse, tell me and I will add it to the Supplements section of this page.

**Q:** Why don&#39;t you write more frequently?
**A:** I have other things going on. I am a busy guy, and I don&#39;t exist purely to entertain.

**Q:** You don&#39;t?
**A:** Probably not. I really need to finish my degree at the moment so don&#39;t be surprised if I delay new stories for weeks or months. If I don&#39;t edit this page for over a year I am probably dead.

**Q:** I want to ask a question that isn&#39;t here.
**A:** That was not a question.

**Q:** I want to ask a question that isn&#39;t here?
**A:** Message me.
