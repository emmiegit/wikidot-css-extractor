**Item #:** SCP-6088

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation agents embedded within the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are to periodically search through all stored records and check for signs of SCP-6088. In the event of a positive identification, the contaminated record is to be temporarily sealed and monitored until the phenomenon abates.

**Description:** SCP-6088 is a phenomenon in which written records pertaining to NASA&#39;s Voyager program are spontaneously altered to include reference to a fictitious //Herald// space probe. These alterations are relatively minor, consisting of at most a single paragraph, but details described are consistent across occurrences. Alterations caused by SCP-6088 are believed to persist only for a short amount of time -- the longest observed alteration lasting only six hours.

Alterations caused by SCP-6088 most often consist of brief and macabre references to //Herald// as a counterpart to //Voyager//, usually replacing //Voyager 2// in descriptions. Even in cases where they are not outright replaced, mentions of //Voyager 2// are often excised during SCP-6088. No records to date have explicitly described the supposed purpose of //Herald//, and what information is provided does not give any wider context.

Mentions of a &#39;Black Accusation&#39; -- a presumed counterpart to the Golden Record carried by //Voyager 1// and //2// -- are also included in a number of SCP-6088 alterations.

&gt; //&#34;I&#39;ve been reading over the records you want compiled onto the Accusation. The majority I would agree with, but the current Turkish government doesn&#39;t recognize what happened in Armenia as a genocide. Diplomatically, can we really include it?&#34;//

&gt; **Original Text:** //&#34;Thank you for the update. I&#39;ve looked over the figures myself, but I&#39;d feel reassured if you were to go over them one more time. Better safe than sorry, you understand?&#34;//
&gt; **Writer:** Edward C. Stone, former project scientist for Voyager.
