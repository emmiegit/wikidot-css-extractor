++++ NOTICE FROM THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE COORDINATION AND PROJECTS OPERATION COMMAND OFFICE
----
The following projects have been under the purview of CICAPOCO Boxercrat Solstice. Please direct request for Boxercrat Solstice&#39;s assistance to the CICAPOCO Section of Personnel Capabilities.

--Boxercrat Solstice (Please do not contact me directly about selachians you want to see pugilisated. I have my own priorities. This means you, %%title%%)

[[/=]]
[[/div]]
[[/module]]

&gt; Please see below for my project punchfolio. By my own reckoning, my work has led to the pugilification of over 803,420,609 naturally occurring Selachian Entities.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, the Centre seems to be suffering from some extra-universal contamination.
&gt; 
&gt; Personally, I blame my cousin for stealing my credentials and dumping his fanfiction on my work laptop.
&gt; 
&gt; If need be, I volunteer him for selachification and pugilation.

//They are the only insurer with a proven record when it comes to anomalous, esoteric, and extremely rare world-changing &#34;black swan&#34; events. They&#39;ve got a most-likely anomalous model for forecasting the probability and impact of these kinds of events, which of course is proprietary. Rest assured, though — our best and our brightest have pored over every contract we&#39;ve had with them and every payout in every year, and we can trust them to adhere to our contracts to the letter.//

//And of course, Goldbaker-Reinz will aid you in your mundane insurance needs as well.//

//We&#39;re so happy you decided to join our Foundation family, and we hope your career is a long and fruitful one.//

Quite possibly the only tale to be the subject of a request for takedown via admin fiat.

&#34;every time i read anything lord has written its the most cursed shit ive ever seen and also somehow compelling writing&#34;
--[[*User stephlynch]]

&#34;u know what lord youre officially the coolest author in my eyes tbh&#34;
--[[*User stephlynch]], again. The context is embarrassing so don&#39;t google my username.

&#34;spc fucking sucks but you do it incredibly well&#34;
--[[*user Ralliston]]
 
&#34;Every time I saw it plugged I rolled my eyes and said nah because the title looked boring and I am not boring so we wouldn’t have been a good couple but I just read it and it’s so funny please everyone go read this garbage and +1 it&#34;
--[[*User Pedagon]], on [[[CCK-class &#34;Copyright Infringement Lawsuit&#34; Scenario]]]

&#34;I hope to someday rip your intestines from those ears of yours for making me read that utterly deranged series of paragraphs&#34;
--[[*User JakDragonX]], on [[[deusvolt |Deus Volt!]]]

&#34;It&#39;s excellently written and has a lot of fun ideas and characterization and lore. It can&#39;t be canon because you&#39;re insane and I&#39;m not allowing this perversion of my timeline but i desperately want it to be so&#34;
--[REDACTED]

&#34;you were already crazy before&#34;

&#34;sharks are good&#34;
--[[*User Lt Flops]], current most prolific Shark Punching Center author

&#34;Cheese man infringes copyright.&#34;

&#34;I thought you were just some normal guy.

But now that I know you&#39;re actually the lordxvnv, one of the most beloved and professional SCP authors&#34;

In the event that I should leave the site, defined as being inactive for greater than 5 years, any co-authored pages should go to their co-authors except for deletion rights. Any collaborative pages should go to either the co-authors or to MAST. 

If I cannot be contacted for a period greater than 1 month, anyone currently working on a collaboration with me should feel free to complete and post it as they see fit so long as they provide me with co-author credit.
