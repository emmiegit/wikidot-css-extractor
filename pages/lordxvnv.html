++++ NOTICE FROM THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE COORDINATION AND PROJECTS OPERATION COMMAND OFFICE
----
The following projects have been under the purview of CICAPOCO Boxercrat Solstice. Please direct request for Boxercrat Solstice&#39;s assistance to the CICAPOCO Section of Personnel Capabilities.

--Boxercrat Solstice (Please do not contact me directly about selachians you want to see pugilisated. I have my own priorities. This means you, %%title%%)

[[/=]]
[[/div]]
[[/module]]

&gt; Please see below for my project punchfolio. By my own reckoning, my work has led to the pugilification of over 803,420,609 naturally occurring Selachian Entities.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, the Centre seems to be suffering from some extra-universal contamination.
&gt; 
&gt; Personally, I blame my cousin for stealing my credentials and dumping his fanfiction on my work laptop.
&gt; 
&gt; If need be, I volunteer him for selachification and pugilation.

[[module ListPages name=&#34;scp-6987&#34;]]
++++ - [[[SCP-6987]]] - Your Legally Entitled Coverage As An Employee of the SCP Foundation (Provided by Goldbaker-Reinz Ltd.) - [+%%rating%%]

//They are the only insurer with a proven record when it comes to anomalous, esoteric, and extremely rare world-changing &#34;black swan&#34; events. They&#39;ve got a most-likely anomalous model for forecasting the probability and impact of these kinds of events, which of course is proprietary. Rest assured, though — our best and our brightest have pored over every contract we&#39;ve had with them and every payout in every year, and we can trust them to adhere to our contracts to the letter.//

//And of course, Goldbaker-Reinz will aid you in your mundane insurance needs as well.//

//We&#39;re so happy you decided to join our Foundation family, and we hope your career is a long and fruitful one.//

//We scoured the interwebz (even the magickal Dark Web) to put together these reviews of the 5 best colleges for studying Things Man Was Not Meant To Know.//

An exploration of the &#34;Broken Masquerade clickbait&#34; genre.

//&#34;[DATA EXPUNGED]!&#34; the legally-distinct cyborg samurai clad in dark armor shouted as he lunged for the Ring of Nibelung, deflecting the Foundation mad-scientist&#39;s (credentials: captain of Foundation Space Starship SCP-2063, mad scientist, grandfather) ontokinetic retroactive existence eraser fireball with his vibrating British science-wand as he did so.//

Quite possibly the only tale to be the subject of a request for takedown via admin fiat.

++++ - [[[SPC-105]]] - WORLD IRIS - [+%%rating%%]

//The Centre realized that one day soon, the future would look like selachians being punched in the face forever, and it knew it had to dream bigger. And I was there, leading the transformation.//

//It&#39;s been longer than that, and I&#39;m not leaving any time soon. This is the best job a girl could ask for.//

A format-screw for the Shark Punching Centre format. Featuring everyone&#39;s waifu, Iris Thompson.
