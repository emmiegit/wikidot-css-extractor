++++ WELCOME TO KENSING’S WRITING FARM!

Howdy y’all! You’ve found yourself on the homepage of the Kensing Farm, where I grow and publish SCP pages and tales by the bushel! Take a look at the produce!

-- //Most Likely Kensing//
[[/=]]
[[/div]]

//Right here, we’ve got our home-grown SCP Foundation tales, with the upcoming tale crop growing nicely in the draft stages. I&#39;d recommend the series in particular!//

||~ SCP Tales||
|| [http://www.scpwiki.com/back-to-your-irregularly-scheduled-programming Back to Your Irregularly Scheduled Programming] || Here&#39;s a somewhat gross tale about a nasty corporate documentary revealing and introducing my Greazeburger Incorporated GOI, and one of my favorites! Also, there’s an excellent reading by [[*user Doctor Fullham]] on this one, so be sure to check it out!||
|| [http://www.scpwiki.com/a-disgruntled-fan-letter-on-the-subject-of-clownery A Disgruntled Fan Letter on the Subject of Clownery] || This jamcon tale is an in-universe angry fan letter set in [[*user Tropinano]]&#39;s Clownverse, and I had a lot of fun with this mess! ||
|| [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/true-stories-with-lincoln-smoke-1-bambousio-starswinger-and True Stories With Lincoln Smoke #1: Bambousio Starswinger and Comedy Cryptids] || Another Clownverse tale, this time featuring a podcast gone completely off-the-rails! ||
|| [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/pulled-pork Pulled Pork] || A creepy tale set in [[*user marcelles_raynes]]&#39; upcoming setting, where almost all natural light has vanished from the earth. Take a look! ||
|| [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-canadian-standoff A Canadian Standoff] || Written for [[*user Azamo]] during the 2021 Holiday Art Exchange, this tale about a lunch thief getting caught in the act is one of my personal favorites! ||
|| [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/corporate-dealings-after-the-calamity Corporate Dealings After The Calamity] || A melancholy unhuman tale featuring Martin Greaze, a strange desk lamp, and pancake mix.||

//Next, we’ve got our SCP Foundation articles, fresh from my sandbox page! So far, a good variety of horror, humor, and maybe something in-between.//

||~ SCP Articles||
|| [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6951 SCP-6951: Loyalty to the Company] || One of my darkest articles yet, this Greazeburger article features a dark insight into the company policies of Greazeburger Incorporated. ||
|| [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5324 SCP-5324: There&#39;ll Be No Next Time] || This one&#39;s the result of me wanting to see if I could pull off a horror skip in about 400 words! The end result worked out pretty well.||
|| [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6676] SCP-6676: Unless] || A horror article about a worst-of-both-worlds combination between human and plant, the destruction of public and private property alike, and the discovery that the Foundation&#39;s motives aren&#39;t too different from the creatures that are irreparably altering the state of the world. ||
|| [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5519 SCP-5519: A Dark Timeline] || Right here&#39;s a short, weird skip very, very loosely based off of my frustration with various food intolerances. Fortunately, this takes place in an alternate universe, and is limited to a very distant corner of the Foundation multiverse!||
|| [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5229 SCP-5229: Dem Wet Bones] || This was my first-round entry for Jamcon 2021 before a currently under-way rewrite began, and it&#39;s a nice horror article about a liquid-craving skeleton!||
|| [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5951 SCP-5951: Corporate Dealings in the Multiverse at Large] || This one’s a nice Greazeburger skip about corporate takeover and also a quasi-sequel to Irregularly Scheduled Programming, although not as vibrant as the tale.||
|| [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5215 SCP-5215: Welp, Sky’s Haunted] || My first skip here is a not-as-weird article about a friendly entity trying to help with light pollution in the somewhat far-off future, and while it is short, manages to express a melancholy atmosphere pretty well over the course of the story.||

Now, there&#39;s serious stuff for a minute, so here&#39;s what should happen if I ever buy the farm:

&gt; 
&gt; If I, Kensing, am inactive on the site, the IRC network, or the SCP Discord for over one year //without// prior notice, then [[*user Oboebandgeek99]] has control over my unhuman content, [[*user Tropinano]] has control over my clownverse content, and [[*user Mooagain]] has control over my Greazeburger content. I trust the staff of the SCP Wiki to handle the rest of my work responsibly.
&gt; 

Here&#39;s hoping that I won&#39;t mysteriously gain possession of a large, open pasture anytime soon!</textarea></pre>
