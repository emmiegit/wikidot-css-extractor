-KO&#39;s first Safe-class anomaly.
[[/&lt;]]
[[include info:end]]

**Item #:** SCP-458-KO

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-458-KO is to be kept in the research archives when not in use. If needed, SCP-458-KO can be played using a videocassette recorder located on the TV in the staff cafeteria. SCP-458-KO, or any data recording of its contents, is strictly prohibited from being brought outside of the Foundation.

**Description:** SCP-458-KO is an unmarked and standard videotape. Subject&#39;s anomalous properties manifest when replayed on a videocassette recorder. When SCP-458-KO is replayed, a newscast-like video will be projected that reports on the events that occurred on the current day. The format of the video is similar to that of a general news program, but the person who appears as an announcer is completely different per day. SCP-458-KO&#39;s recording time is believed to be infinite, but the reason for this is unknown. The mechanism by which the content of the video is updated on a daily basis is also unknown.

Upon switching channels while SCP-458-KO is playing, the topics covered in the news will change accordingly. Topics are organized into crime, politics, sports, and entertainment by country. Content reported by SCP-458-KO is identical to that provided by regular news programs. However, in the event that the normal news reports differ from facts, SCP-458-KO will not report the same content, and will instead broadcast factual news. The announcer&#39;s expression is depressive, at times accompanied by anger. Then, unlike fabricated news, only factual news is broadcasted.

SCP-458-KO was discovered and recovered by the Foundation on the ███ radio station, housed in the multitude of videotape storage crates in the archives.

**Addendum:** Approval Request

&gt; //There is a growing trend among Foundation agents and researchers to show little interest in anything but SCP-related matters. Requesting permission to use SCP-458-KO in the staff cafeteria.// ㅡ Dr. ████

//Approved.// ㅡ O5-█

**Addendum:** Research Note

&gt; //On ██, it was confirmed that the area the Foundation had sealed off due to intelligence operations was covered in the news of SCP-458-KO. As long as the contents are not leaked outside of the Foundation, there seems to be no immediate problem. - Dr. ████//
