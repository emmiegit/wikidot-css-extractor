Ah, hello! Thanks for stopping by. And not just an ordinary &#34;hello&#34; and &#34;thanks for stopping by&#34; that you&#39;d get from all other author pages and interactions with... &#34;people&#34;, this is a //very special// hello and thanks for visiting my author page, COMPLETELY unlike any other you&#39;ve ever received.

I heard you say &#34;what makes it special?&#34;
And I&#39;m glad you asked!

Anyway, since you&#39;ve visited, you are obligated by a strict covenant between myself and you, the reader, that requires you to read all of the below works and upvote and comment on each, else one of the following things will happen:
# You&#39;ll notice you itch somewhere on your body
# You&#39;ll become very aware of how often you blink
# The Demon Kl&#39;Fthgnptk will arise from their damned slumber of ten thousand nightmares, dragging you down to The Land Darker Than Dreams[[footnote]]Previous participants describe this as &#34;a minor inconvenience&#34;[[/footnote]] for eternity[[footnote]]Time runs different in T. L. D. T. D., so in real time, this&#39;ll cost you about five to ten minutes.[[/footnote]]
# Nothing (most common roll)

Please note the covenant that you have agreed to by accessing this page is non-binding, so.

If yer interested, here&#39;s... some very minimal author commentary. Spoilers, probably. Commentary doesn&#39;t add much, honestly, you might as well read &#39;em. Feel free to ask questions though, if you&#39;d like.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ SCP-5260 - Let Them Dream&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]
First one I ever wrote. Went down pretty well. 
Helped me notice that most of the stories I&#39;d been writing had a theme of being trapped. 
I wouldn&#39;t think about it too much, if I were you.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ SCP-6667 - For the Love of Humanity&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]
This was an entry to the SCP-6000 contest. This was fun to write. Spot 6667 is a spot I&#39;ve rationalized as the best option because, since SCP-6667 is all about the harm and necessity of hope, now on the SCP site, hope will always remain after the devil&#39;s SCP.


Also check out this fucking sick fanart by [[*user DodoDevil]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ SCP-5443 - Apocalyptic Evil? We got some in the back&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]
Idea to post in two hours. All things considered, this worked out pretty well.
And one part I&#39;m still particularly fond of is trying to imagine how calligraphy was supposed to factor into this ultimate fight.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ SCP-6786 - Extradimensional&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]
This may be both my greatest accomplishment and my worst.
I am actually proud of this one. It&#39;s sub 100 words and man, I am a fan of the special containment procedures.

At time of writing, it has the second highest number of votes of all my articles, but has a score of less than 10. 
Some people love it, some people hate it. That&#39;s kinda cool.

As for what it means?
I know exactly what I think it means. You can ask me if you&#39;d like.
