**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6346 is a non-physical and non-anomalous concept, and requires no containment. For procedures relating to entities described by SCP-6346, refer to the //Peripheral Entity Management Procedures//.

**Description:** SCP-6346 is the hypothetical concept of an entity which cannot be listed or referenced in any database[[footnote]]Defined as an organized collection of information that can be deliberately read, added to and edited by multiple individuals.[[/footnote]]. Within the hypothetical scenario, successfully attempting to list or refer to the hypothetical entity in a database is not possible.

Any entity which cannot be listed or referenced in any database is described by SCP-6346, regardless of other characteristics. Entities described by SCP-6346 are anomalous, by definition, but SCP-6346 as a concept possesses no anomalous semantic properties.

------

**Peripheral Entity Management Procedures:**

*  Procedure-6346-01 allows for the application of Emergency Infohazard Containment Protocols in perpetuity, bypassing the need for typical recording, for any entity described by SCP-6346 which cannot be physically contained due to size, spread or any other inherent trait.

* Procedure-6346-02 allows for the use of a suitable Anomalous Object Probationary Containment Chamber in perpetuity, bypassing the need for typical recording, for any entity described by SCP-6346 which can feasibly be physically contained, and is either non-sapient or possesses additional anomalous properties.

* Procedure-6346-03 allows for the nonspecific access to one unit of Level-3 Foundation Staff Housing[[footnote]]120 m^^2^^, with three bedrooms and two bathrooms.[[/footnote]], located in Lincoln, Nebraska, for any non-anomalous human described by SCP-6346.

* Procedure-6346-04 allows for the preparation of a Foundation-operated fund, supplied with 10000 USD each month. Any non-anomalous human described by SCP-6346 can freely withdraw or transfer cash from this fund.

* Procedure-6346-05 allows for the preparation of a volunteering organization, open to any non-anomalous human described by SCP-6346, providing opportunities to work on Foundation-associated sites in Southeast Nebraska in the field of electronic installation and maintenance.

* Procedure-6346-06 allows access to certain Foundation resources for the spouses and up to three children of any non-anomalous human described by SCP-6346, in order to supply or alter any legal documentation interfered with by their relationship to the individual described by SCP-6346.

* Procedure-6346-07 allows for the establishment of a small Foundation-operated educational facility, located in Lincoln, Nebraska. The facility will offer a selection of courses for any non-anomalous human described by SCP-6346, including instruction in written and spoken Vietnamese, as well as American and Haiphong Sign Language.

* Procedure-6346-08 allows for the establishment of a Foundation-operated clinic, located in Lincoln, Nebraska, for any non-anomalous human described by SCP-6346. As well as providing primary and emergency care, this clinic should also maintain a stock of insulin for use in treating type 1 diabetes, and should employ a mental health counselor specializing in treating long-term anxiety and depressive disorders.
