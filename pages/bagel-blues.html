Faeowynn Wilson stepped out of the Dunkin&#39; Donuts into a torrential downpour. She quickly jumped back under the awning, pulled some napkins over her head, and sprinted out into the rain before hopping into her boyfriend&#39;s car and slamming the door shut, the car humming off not a second later.

&#34;Damn. Sorry I took so long, someone stole my food.&#34;

&#34;Wait, really?&#34;

&#34;Yeah. I hope they really needed it. Rip-&#34;- the rustling of packaging -&#34;-but at least I got a replacement.&#34;

&#34;Well, that&#39;s--&#34;

&#34;Ohhh my fucking god. I&#39;m in hell.&#34;

&#34;Huh?&#34;

Faeowynn looks up at him.

&#34;I. Hoo. Okay. Okay, this is a dumb question, but do you eat this place&#39;s, like, the food shit? If so: croissant opinions?&#34;

The sound of drops on the windshield.

The bumps of the road in the cabin.

The look of bewilderment on Alex&#39;s face.

&#34;No-- no, you know what, fuck it, don&#39;t tell me. Why the fuck would you have a bacon egg and cheese on a fucking CROISSANT as the default? What the fuck is that shit? It&#39;s- it&#39;s a light airy pastry that maybe, okay, //maybe// could support some jam, or a little custard, or something -- but why the FUCK would you put bacon egg and cheese on it. Why?&#34;

&#34;Fae?&#34;

&#34;No, why? They have literally //every other type of bread// a bacon egg and cheese is reasonable on. Texas toast? Sure, whatever. English muffin? I&#39;d be down for that. Bagel? The natural fucking option.
    
&#34;But a fucking //croissant.// Jesus //CHRIST.//&#34;

&#34;Jeez, Fae. You&#39;re really committed to dunking on this perfectly fine breakfast sandwich. I mean, I&#39;ll take it if you don&#39;t want it.&#34;

&#34;Alex, you don&#39;t get it! It&#39;s fucking horrible! It doesn&#39;t even have the right shape! It&#39;s a god damn crescent, Alex! You can&#39;t fit a round shape on it, it&#39;s got like one third the cross-sectional area!&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s fine. I think it&#39;s perfectly fine food.&#34;

&#34;Listen! FUCK! Listen! I&#39;m not digging on you. Okay? Or on other people who would want that. People like shit that&#39;s illogical to me every day. That&#39;s fine. Good, even. But, Jesus Christ why, Why is it the default?&#34;

The windshield wipers flicked, back and forth, back and forth.

&#34;And, y&#39;know, I didn&#39;t used to be so pissed off. I was a normal person. I was a //normal person// until I, without fail, started getting //exclusively croissants//, even when I //explicitly ordered// other breads. Every single fucking time. 

&#34;I&#39;ve been there at least fifteen times, Alex. Do you get that? Do you know what this is, to me? It&#39;s like God reached his hand down and closed breakfast on me forever. And you know what the worst part is?&#34;

Alex craned his neck to see through the storm. Giving up, he pulled over to the shoulder to wait it out. &#34;What&#39;s the worst part, Fae?&#34;

&#34;Today. Today, they got my order right. Today, //only// today, they got it right, Alex.&#34;

&#34;B-&#34;

&#34;And someone stole it.&#34;

Rain smacked down on the roof, //ba-dum//--

&#34;And the replacement I got was croissants.&#34;</textarea></pre>
