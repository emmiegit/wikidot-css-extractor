    name= Cake| caption=A Developed SCP-4770-1, Pre-Hatching Event]]
**Item #:** SCP-4770

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-4770 will be contained in Site-17&#39;s humanoid containment cells. No more than five instances of SCP-4770 shall be contained at any given time. SCP-4770 requires the normal amenities of a human adult except for access to food. Personnel entering SCP-4770&#39;s containment chamber are required to wear Foundation issued gas masks. Level 2 clearance is needed to bypass this restriction.

Furthermore, The Mobile Task Force &#34;Crab Crackers&#34; has been tasked with eradicating colonies not currently in containment. The guise of an E-coli outbreak has proven successful in covering up an outbreak of SCP-4770 due to the location of its colonies. Amnestics class B or lower is available for survivors of an outbreak.

After the events of Site-██, no cake resembling SCP-4770-1 will be served at any Foundation location. 
 
**Description:** SCP-4770 is a previously unidentified species in the genus Phronima, [[footnote]]A genus of parasitic deep-sea amphipods[[/footnote]] coined Phronima crustulam by researchers. SCP-4770 is parasitic and consists of a three-stage life cycle. Due to the wide physiological differences of these life stages, they have been labeled SCP-4770-1, SCP-4770-2, and SCP-4770-3.

* //SCP-4770-1//: SCP-4770-1 is a cake composed entirely of only hardened frosting. It is, on average, 0.2 m wide. Chemical analysis of the frosting has revealed that it contains 150% more sucrose then regular buttercream. Staff has described it as tasting &#34;extraordinarily sweet.&#34; Furthermore, X-Ray analysis of SCP-4770-1 has shown the internal chamber to be hollow, which is consistent with the theory that SCP-4770-1 is an egg for SCP-4770-2.

* //SCP-4770-2//: SCP-4770-2 appears to be the zoe[[footnote]]Infant Stage[[/footnote]] stage of the lifecycle. Individuals are roughly 0.030-0.040 mm long and can take several various forms. SCP-4770-2 is able to survive on land by having adapted to filter oxygen through rudimentary lungs in place of gills. This is unlike any other known organism and research is currently underway in an attempt to emulate this process. Similarly, its digestive system has evolved for a primary diet of sucrose. SCP-4770-2 also hosts a proboscis that is roughly 0.25 meters in length.[[footnote]]The average size of a human esophagus[[/footnote]] When brought into contact with a human, SCP-4770-2 enters a hatching state. This is marked by the instance of SCP-4770-2 &#34;hatching&#34; and latching onto the host&#39;s mouth with its chelae and pleopods.[[footnote]]SCP-4770&#39;s appendages[[/footnote]] The proboscis is then forced through the esophagus and into the stomach. SCP-4770-2 then proceeds to drains the stomach of its hydrochloric acid, dumping the liquid through an opening near the top of the proboscis. Analysis of a proboscis recovered from Site-██ demonstrated that the proboscis is lined with epithelial cells that secrete mucus similar to the human stomach. When the host&#39;s stomach is empty, the proboscis is pulled from the host and detached from SCP-4770-2. This allows the instance of SCP-4770-2 to enter the host&#39;s body by forcing itself into the stomach. SCP-4770-2 proceeds to [REDACTED], gaining control of the host&#39;s nervous and endocrine systems. This creates an instance of SCP-4770-3.

* //SCP-4770-3//: An adult instance SCP-4770 that has undergone a hatching event. It is unknown if SCP-4770-3 is sentient. Its main objective is to lay eggs in order to spread the infection. When an instance of SCP-4770-3 is created, it immediately manifests a new personality for itself. It is currently unknown if this personality is created upon creation of SCP-4770-3 or inherited from the SCP-4770-2 instance. SCP-4770-3 will then attempt to find a suitable location to create its nest. Locations of nests have been found, as of the date of  ████, as follows: bakeries, cake-shops, local grocery stores, Site-██&#39;s cafeteria, and [REDACTED]. After creating its nest, SCP-4770-3 will produce SCP-4770-1 by [REDACTED]. 


**Discovery:** SCP-4770 was discovered by Agent Rutteb after returning from containment of SCP-████. Agent went to the onsite cafeteria only to find numerous instances of SCP-4770-1. The report of this encounter can be found under &#34;Incident Report-1&#34; and &#34;Incident Report-2.&#34;
After retaking Site-██, it was found that [REDACTED]% of personnel had become hosts for SCP-4770. It was soon discovered that Researcher McAllen, a Level 2 Researcher new to the Foundation, came into possession of an instance of SCP-4770-1. It is unknown how this occurred. 




The following reports detail the events that took place at Site-██.
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Incident Report 1: 8th Sept, ████, 11:50&#34; hide=&#34;- 8th Sept, ████ 11:50&#34;]]
&gt; **Agent Rutteb**: &#34;This is Agent Rutteb, Level 2 Field Agent, needing assistance at Site-██. Not completely sure what is going one here, possible containment breach. Staff seems compromised. Site-17, do you read me?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Note at this point command of Site-17 attempts to communicate with Agent. However, Agent Rutteb appears to not have received the message.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Rutteb**: &#34;Site-17, I hope you are reading this. I just returned from containment of SCP-████ to Site-██. Something is off with this place, command. The cafeteria is full of cakes and half the staff seems to have been infected with some form of anomaly. They aren&#39;t themselves anymore. I can&#39;t even reach the onsite command here- when I went to find them all I found was the cakes in their seats.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [At this point, Site-17 has established control of Site-██&#39;s onsite video surveillance system. A copy of this feed can be requested from Doctor Frederick.]
&gt; 
&gt; [Surveillance of Agent Rutteb shows that he had been walking down a low security hallway. He appears to be equipped with a standard foundation hidden jacket radio. Nothing noteworthy appeared immediately suspicious to Site-17&#39;s control. Attempts were made to contact Site-██ control but were unsuccessful.]
&gt; 
&gt; [Behind Agent Rutteb, in a nearby doorway, a researcher later identified as Level 2 Researcher Jeffery Daniels appears. When he spots Agent Rutteb, a large smile appears on his face.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Daniels**: &#34;Friend, where have you been! Come, come, you look famished! What are you, only meat and bones. Let us go, there is so much cake to be eaten.&#34; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Rutteb**: &#34;Jeffery! Where did you even come from!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Daniels**: &#34;Friend, you must have me confused! My name is Bork. I was just communing with the goddess. You should join us, it is about time for the great feast!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Rutteb**: &#34;Jeff, what has happened to you?”
&gt; 
&gt; [Researcher Daniels quickly grabs Agent Rutteb&#39;s wrist, locking eyes with him.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Daniels**: &#34;Now, now. My name is Bork. I am not this Jeff. I can explain over cake.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Rutteb**: &#34;Bork? Sorry, I thought you were Jeff. I&#39;ll come later, I need to get some things first.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [At this point, Agent Rutteb quickly frees himself from Researcher Daniel&#39;s grasp and hurries away.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Rutteb**: &#34;Command, are you reading this? This isn&#39;t like them; I mean I’m Jeff&#39;s son&#39;s godfather. Is this mimetic, viral…&#34; 
&gt; 
&gt; [Researcher Daniels, who had produced a pipe from behind his lab coat, knocks Agent Rutteb over the head, knocking him unconscious. Several other, previously unseen researchers then appear from other doorways and proceeded to drag the limp body of Agent Rutteb into the onsite cafeteria.]
&gt; 
&gt; [During this time, O-5 command declared an emergency at Site-██. Site-17, being the closest site to Site-██, was tasked with the initial response. Several Mobile Tasks Forces were sent to the site; however, due to the remote location of Site-██, monitoring of the anomaly continued during the twelve-hour transport window.]
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Incident Report 2: 8th Sept,  ████, 18:22&#34; hide=&#34;- 8th Sept,  ████, 18:22&#34;]]
&gt; [During the hours Agent Rutteb was unconscious, Site-17&#39;s command had been monitoring Site-██ anomaly. It was recorded that, in the cafeteria with Agent Rutteb, there were twelve non-infected individuals and thirty infected.]
&gt; 
&gt; [At 18:22 hours, Camera footage shows Agent Rutteb beginning to stir.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Rutteb**: &#34;Christ, got a quick one on me. Command, I hope you&#39;re still present. I think I&#39;m in the thick of it now.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [At 18:25 hours, two of the infected began to smile and proceeds to grab one of the non-infected. The individual was soon forced through the kitchen door. Simultaneously, all of the infected chant &#34;Let him eat cake!&#34;]
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Rutteb**: &#34;What is this? Ok, think, Rutteb. Command, I&#39;m going to try to figure out what the hell is going on here. Stand by&#34; [Agent Rutteb can be seen sitting up in what is believed an attempt gather his surroundings. At this moment there is a terrified scream from the back room.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Rutteb**:  &#34;Christ! Command, what did I get myself into?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [Agent Rutteb, with breathing heavily audible, attempts to move closer to one of the infected individuals. The individual was identified as D-33441 by their tattoos.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Rutteb**: &#34;D-33441, I will terminate you unless you tell me what is going on!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **D-33441**: &#34;My name is Ruttenberg. I am a high mother of this colony. You are to be given eternal life through the wonders of cake. Let us all eat cake!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [At the prompt of D-33441, all of the infected proceeded to chant &#34;Let us all eat cake!&#34; while another non-infected is brought into the back room. Another scream can be heard soon after.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Rutteb**, hands visibly shaking: &#34;Ok, High Mother, what the fuck?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **D-33441**: &#34;We are the eternal life givers, the one true colony. Be hollowed out by our greatness and take us inside of you. Receive us, SCP Foundation, and be made whole and greater than you once were.&#34; 
&gt; [Another non-infected was taken to the kitchen, followed by another chant.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Rutteb**:  &#34;Who sent you! The Church? Insurgency?&#34;
&gt; [Another scream can be heard from the kitchen.]
&gt; 
&gt; **D-33441**: &#34;You are thinking too little, my egg. Soon you will be greater. Soon you will know.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [At this point D-33441 refused to answer any more of Agent Rutteb&#39;s questions, responding only with chants and screams from the kitchen.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Rutteb**: &#34;Command, I have no idea what&#39;s going on. There are a few people left here: a researcher who is frantically taking notes, a D-Class who is being restrained, some Level 1 staff  crying in a corner. God, I hope you show up soon and cut this cult to pieces.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [At 19:00 hours, Agent Rutteb is pulled into the kitchen.]
&gt; 
&gt; [The infected staff proceeds to drag Agent Rutteb into the kitchen and push him onto his knees. Later analysis confirmed that 3 of these individuals were of the original ten of the non-infected individuals present with Agent Rutteb earlier.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Rutteb**: &#34;What are you? And get you hands off me!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [One infected individual, identified as a member of the janitorial staff, steps forward. Leaning over and holding out his hands, the man began dry heaving vociferously. His eyes began to bulge from his head while his neck [redacted] until a single white frosting cake landed onto the floor. The entire process lasted only one minute. The cake was then placed into Agent Rutteb&#39;s palm.]
&gt; 
&gt; [A creature, later identified as SCP-4770-2, proceeds to leap from the cake and wrap itself into Agent Rutteb&#39;s mouth. Despite Agent Rutteb&#39;s bloodied screams, it propels its proboscis down his throat and removes a green and yellow liquid, later identified as stomach acid, before removing and detaching its proboscis. Control watched as the creature forced itself down Agent Rutteb&#39;s throat as the Agent violently clawed at his throat, coughing up blood and tissue. Agent Rutteb silenced after ten minutes.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Janitorial Staff**: &#34;Welcome brother. What is your name.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Rutteb**: &#34;Epoc, sister. Epoc.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [After this point, Agent Rutteb was involved in producing ██ cakes for the remaining non-infected.]

]]
&gt; 
&gt; Agent Rutteb was recovered during re-pacification of Site-██ and transported to Site-17. Immediate vivisection was performed on Agent Rutteb, who had been restrained by Agents. During the first section of the procedure, he would not stop shouting &#34;My name is Epoc!&#34; and &#34;You will all thank us for this!&#34; 
&gt; 
&gt; During the initial part of the procedure, researchers noted that minimal changes to the host&#39;s physical body structure occurred due to the parasitic host. However, upon removal of Agent&#39;s ribcage, it was found that SCP-4770-2&#39;s various appendages were protruding from the stomach lining, particularly in the fundus region[[footnote]]Largest, middle region of the stomach[[/footnote]] of the stomach. Samples taken from the appendages showed that this instance of SCP-4770-2 was secreting several complex chemicals directly into the stomach- first, a batch of complex hormones that is theorized to allow SCP-4770-2 to manipulate the host&#39;s endocrine and nervous system, and, secondly, sodium bicarbonate.[[footnote]]A neutralizer for hydrochloric acid[[/footnote]] Upon dissection of the stomach, SCP-4770-2 was found to be sluggish and soon perished. Finally, a minor tissue complex that seems to have been adapted to produce sucrose at high volumes had replaced much of the parietal cells of the stomach.
&gt; Of note, however, was that a minute after removal of SCP-4770-2, Agent Rutteb stopped shouting for approximately five minute before he began to cry. Before perishing a few minutes, Agent Rutteb had been muttering,  &#34;Put it back. I want it back. I miss my Epoc.&#34;
