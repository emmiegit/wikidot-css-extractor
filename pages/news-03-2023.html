Deep within the scholarly halls of the Wanderer&#39;s Library, one can hear anecdotes and arguments of passion and flourish. A synchronised waltz of construction and destruction, of enlightenment and credo. Do you hear the harmony of rhetoric and reason? Does it near make you weep to witness the artisanal craft of persuasion? The [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/debate-club-contest Debate Club Contest] beckons, scholars.

The Contest is centred around the theme &#34;Common VS Rare&#34; in its many interpretations. Does the universe reach its zenith at the atypical, or the quotidian? Do you value that found once a lifetime, or that found by all? Registrations for the Contest are closed, but observers can still contend for the Critic&#39;s Choice Award by commenting substantially on more than half of all entries, equally distributed among both teams. Remember, it&#39;s not a debate without a response!

Works are featured on the site’s front page as part of the Reviewers’ Spotlight, which acknowledges the time and effort spent by forum reviewers helping other authors develop and edit and their works for the mainsite. Each month, community members are encouraged to nominate forum reviewers who have been both particularly helpful and active. Members of the Forum Criticism Team will then discuss the nominations, and select four prominent reviewers to choose the month’s Reviewers’ Spotlight front-page features.
