This month&#39;s topic is:

+++ Object classes.

Let&#39;s get to your thoughts.

 From: [[user The Great Hippo]]

&gt; Outside of Item #, Object Class is the least interesting part of an SCP article.
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-173&#39;s use of &#34;Object Class: Euclid&#34; was never intended as anything more than a way to stimulate the dark recesses of the imagination. &#34;What does it mean?&#34; -- &#34;What makes it &#39;Euclid&#39;?&#34; -- &#34;What sort of organization uses terms like this?!&#34; -- these are not questions SCP-173 sought to answer. They&#39;re questions SCP-173 sought to //inspire//. If SCP-173 explained what &#34;Euclid&#34; meant, it wouldn&#39;t have had the same creepy charm.
&gt; 
&gt; Over the next decade, authors have expended literally //millions// of words to expand and justify arbitrary design elements in a piece of flash-fiction that&#39;s less than 250 words long. We have created an expanded lore surrounding a poopy murder statue, and we&#39;re absurdly neurotic about ensuring every piece of fiction we write here conforms to the precise dimensions //of// that lore.
&gt; 
&gt; Let me ask you something: How does a werewolf die? Silver bullets? Removal of its heart? Shot by the person it loves?
&gt; 
&gt; **No.** A werewolf dies however the hell you want it to die. //Because werewolves aren&#39;t real//.
&gt; 
&gt; Object Class is whatever you want it to be. It&#39;s whatever serves your purposes best. It&#39;s whatever the person reading it decides it is. It is quite possibly the //least// important decision you&#39;ll make when writing your article.
&gt; 
&gt; You want to know what made SCP-173 &#34;Object Class: Euclid&#34;? Here&#39;s your answer:
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;It sounded spooky.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; You&#39;re welcome.

&gt; There&#39;s been a lot of discussion about how to properly classify scips, as well as new ways of categorizing other attributes of articles. While there is obviously valuable conversations to be had regarding this, I feel it&#39;s important to not lose sight of what they are ultimately for.
&gt; 
&gt; Object classes are for narrative effect.
&gt; 
&gt; Sometimes the effect doesn&#39;t matter that much. It&#39;s Safe, just keep it in a locker. It&#39;s Euclid, which is about as vague as object classes get. But the object class / other designations exist to set the reader&#39;s expectations coming in, maybe suggesting it&#39;s harmless, something big is about to happen, or &#34;helpful&#34; like Thaumiel. Any additional warnings or designations you apply on the article contribute to this effect, and as the author you have the obligation to take this and fulfill or subvert it. This is most clear with -EX scips, since from their very listing the reader expects that everything will be revealed as non-anomalous, but will still match the stakes of a typical mainlist article.
&gt; 
&gt; In my opinion, the relevant aspect of the object class is to be part of the introduction, to tell the reader what sort of article this will be. Object classes, threat levels, the anomaly bar, and the choice of picture / caption all contribute to the initial feel of a piece.

&gt; Where do you draw the line on suspension of disbelief in an SCP article?
