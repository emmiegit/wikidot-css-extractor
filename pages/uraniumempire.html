[[[SCP-1285]]]
&gt; //&#34;Audiences are gonna hate this, you know.&#34;//
&gt; //&#34;If I cared for the opinion of every slavering wastrel, I&#39;d be a critic, not a cinematographer.&#34;//
* So this was my first skip. It&#39;s alright I guess.
* Fun little story about this baby: back when I was a babby SCP writer, this was originally just a straight up statue, no context. Some helpful soul told me that the concept sounded &#34;B-Movie&#34;ish and the very next day, I got up, thought &#34;fuck you, it IS a B-Movie!&#34;, and the rest was history.
* I&#39;ve been trying to move away from notes at the end. However, this was made before NatE was a cliche, so neener.
[[[SCP-2677]]]
&gt; //Today&#39;s the day. Make master proud, won&#39;t you?//
* As the years go by, I like this skip less and less. I&#39;m not certain if it&#39;s because my writing style has improved over the years or if it&#39;s because of the four and a half year gap between this and my next ones, but I do find it slightly ironic that my most acclaimed skip is my least favorite.
* Originally, Anderson Harper was meant to be a super bad guy, but atrophy for lethargy, I suppose. Also, I literally can&#39;t remember what this thing&#39;s function was anymore, both intention and practical, so go hog wild I guess.
[[[SCP-3428]]]
&gt; //Maybe it&#39;s the weather. Maybe you&#39;re just thirsty. Chill out with a Pepsi.//
* This was originally supposed to be about wasps. I have no fucking clue what inspired me to write this, cause it&#39;s been 4 years since I uploaded the first draft to my sandbox. 
[[[SCP-952]]]
&gt; //&#34;Hey, V.&#34;//
&gt; //&#34;What could it possibly be this time, Jack?&#34;//
&gt; //&#34;I have this weird idea.&#34;//
* One day, while listening to TTNG&#39;s //Animals//, I realized that a common thread linked nearly every song of my favorite genre together: the inability for nerds to keep a damn relationship together. It&#39;s almost mystifying, turn on the average math rock playlist and it&#39;s either instrumentals or breakup songs.
[[[SCP-3472]]]
&gt; //In my dreams, we&#39;re all smiling.//
* I feel like, whenever I&#39;m writing parents, the most common archetype that comes up is the nervous wreck who loves their child, but isn&#39;t all that //there// for them, emotionally. I have to wonder why I write like this.
* Most of the skip was written in 2013-2014. The letter is the only real part made near when I posted this.
* I&#39;ll ##blue|rewrite## this one day.
[[[surprise-happy-birthday-7|Corner of the Game Room]]]
* This one&#39;s about as true as The Things they Carried is. The feelings are real, however.
[[[SCP-4747]]]
&gt; //Step 6: Mix the jelly into the shavings, all the while declaring your love for one another.//
* I refuse to comment on this any more than &#34;I wrote this in an hour and a half concept to posting.&#34;
[[[SCP-4946]]]
&gt; //&#34;Do 222232244629420445529739893461909967206666939096499764990979600 people even exist?&#34;//
&gt; //&#34;Yes, the fuck are you on about? Keep scrolling.&#34;//
* So it turns out there //wasn&#39;t// a skip called &#34;you have died of dysentery&#34;, and now there is.
* This was originally 4947. That disappeared into a hole.
[[[SCP-4947]]]
&gt; //Direct order from O5-11, images to attach to the file, new exploration authorization. Christ, you&#39;d think we&#39;d back these things up.//
* This is my first horror SCP, I think. 1285 veered too far into black comedy, 2677 was more of a character piece, and the closest 952 got to horror was showing how far a human would go to hurt another human. This one, though, gets back to my roots.
* Fun fact: Yehezkel and Rivka are the parents of Sara. I kinda feel bad for how horrible I&#39;ve been to this family tree.
* --This is my best work, I think.--
[[[SCP-3721]]]
&gt; //You think translating is hard? Try reading what they say.//
* Eskobar briefly talked about [[[SCP-2845]]] on Kaktuskast, using it as an example of when an author &#34;stops fucking around&#34;. I think 3721 is that moment for me.
* The original iteration of this draft was far less focused on the aspect of decay; it was Hippo&#39;s suggestion that they forget their own names that cemented the direction I wanted to take.
* There have been three times where, in the process of writing, I became so disgusted by something I&#39;ve written that I had to dial it back. The third transcript was one of them.
[[[SCP-4690]]]
* My process for conceptualization went as follows:
 * Huh, Japanese architecture is really cool.
 * But orientalism sucks!
 * What if there was a metaphysical cancer made of a mishmash of random architecture taken from a smattering of East-Asian countries, with no attention to detail? Just the pure horrors of orientalism.
 * It&#39;s actually a web created by hyperdimensional spiders.
 * But why are the spiders in our world?
 * They&#39;re here to eat orientalists.
 * Pinkerton is a very good album about an orientalist.
 * Madame Butterfly is my new special interest, oops
 * What if anti-orientalist hyperdimensional spiders ate Lieutenant Pinkerton?
* This article is an abject failure, because nothing will ever be funnier than the actual existence of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_m%C3%A9nage_moderne_de_Madame_Butterfly a 1920 Madame Butterfly porn parody where the director plays a peeping tom who&#39;s made the main character&#39;s bitch]. Jewish bisexuals stay winning.
* I refuse to explain why or how Weezer is Fifthist, and will never expand upon it.
--The OCT Trilogy (Survival Guide, Last Things, Baptism)-- [[[wwydftltimd-hub|When Will You Die for the Last Time in My Dreams]]]
&gt; //Hell is whatever you think it will be, and you deserve it as much as you believe you do.//
* If Technician Empira is my author self-insert, Veronica is her shadow: the sum of my insecurities, boiled down into one miserable character. I suppose that makes her my self-insert as well, even if Veronica and I diverged somewhere down the line. As a result, writing her is an intensely personal experience for me.
* By the time I started the second chapter, I had gotten back on my ADHD meds and started religiously listening to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. You can probably tell how that affected the work.
* I feel like a big theme of the HoS saga is how we deal with trauma and the mistakes of the past. --I&#39;ll probably continue Veronica&#39;s story, one day, along with those of her bandmates.-- Nix the probably, I deliver.
* There have been three times where, in the process of writing, I became so disgusted by something I&#39;ve written that I had to dial it back. The Bandages scene from Survival Guide was one of them.
[[[SCP-4495]]]
* Anyone who tells you this is a horror piece is a lying liar who lies. It&#39;s actually a comedy.
[[[SCP-0166|SCP-166]]]
* I don&#39;t remember who suggested I put a 0 in the url, but I think it was either Kirby or Dolphin.
* The most common criticism I&#39;ve seen of this piece is that it changes a docile, not-//too//-deadly skip into an edgy keterblack. To that I say: &#34;Yes, I did. Why is that supposed to be the problem?&#34;
* The //second// most common criticism I&#39;ve seen is that I rewrote Clef out of the story. To that I ask: &#34;How do you think Nobody obtained Clef&#39;s credentials?&#34;
* The bitterest irony of this story is that it can never //actually// replace its mainlisted counterpart, because it relies too much on its existence to stand on very many legs. Far from replacing 166, I have added onto its justifications.
[[[are-we-gentrified-yet|Are We Gentrified Yet?]]]
* Nico tells me he wrote the project proposal as a joke, with little intention to actually submit it to the wiki. To this day, I wonder whose neck this albatross hangs heavier on.
* I hadn&#39;t read [[[SCP-4485]]] until a little after AWGY&#39;s publication. As far as I was aware, Hansarp was nothing more than a Mekhanite weirdo.
[[[SCP-4886]]]
&gt; //The lead biologist isn&#39;t supposed to make mistakes, but deep down, I always hoped I was wrong. Just not// this //wrong.//
* This skip is intended to be read more than once. In fact, if you haven&#39;t read it at least twice, don&#39;t read the commentary further.
* One thing that fascinated me about [[[SCP-2254]]] was the implication that La Hire, the rapist by proxy responsible for a generation of animal serial killers, was //terrified// of his brothers. After I poached Spades from Bright (and subsequently overhauled him into a neurotic, guilt-ridden child of the Scarlet King), I knew I&#39;d be touching up on his brothers.
* This piece is the capstone of everything I learned from writing for the site. Incorporated is 3721&#39;s prose timing, WWYFTLTIMD&#39;s dialogue crash course, Nadox and the Mekhanite&#39;s character work, 4947&#39;s atmospheric tone, 4495&#39;s clinical disgust, and SCP-0166&#39;s weaponization of the SCP format. It is, almost certainly, my best SCP work.
* If you didn&#39;t pick up on it: 4886 wasn&#39;t lying about [[[SCP-4947|his father]]], and URA-4886 appears in an [[[SCP-952|earlier skip]]]
[[[The Trashfire]]]
&gt; __WELCOME TO HELL__
* This canon exists for the sake of reader convenience, linking my and others&#39; works together into a (hopefully) easier to understand bundle.
* If you can&#39;t tell, I dislike a vast majority of what many readers consider &#34;canon&#34;, but most of all, I dislike the mangled Jewish mythology SCPs like Gate Guardian. Creating a space away from such things is pleasing to me.
[[[SCP-5012]]]
&gt; //Oh great computer, how old, truly, is the universe?//
&gt; 
&gt; //{{you dont want to know the answer to that question}}//
* Every musician corresponds to either a canon, &#39;verse, or canon grouping. I&#39;ve tagged the ones Dr. Goss reports.
[[[SCP-5445]]]
* This was based on a dream I had, on the //exact same night// I had pondered how cool [[[SCP-5040]]] was for being based on a dream. Because staff lacked the evidence to perma my subconscious from the Wiki, I coldposted it the next morning. I regret never finding a way to include the &#34;you have to lick the knife&#34; part of the dream.
[[[SCP-5444]]]
&gt; //When I die, I want my autobiography encrypted.//
* I was inspired by an episode of Forensic Files, where a man pretended to be the man he murdered, sending mail and paying bills as appropriate, but 5444 was already conceptualized by the time I saw that episode so the Parawatch I had in mind was scrapped.
* Sara&#39;s experiences are at least partially autobiographical; not to the point of 1:1 connections, but enough to understand how these things may have gone down.
* You //know// a skip is good when three separate people ask if you&#39;re alright after reading it.
[[[Filled to the Brim with Girlish Glee]]]
&gt; //##deeppink|KeeLee:## But I care about you, even when you won&#39;t care about me.//
* This is a rewrite of a piece by DrChandra and DianaBerry. The original featured Lolly from Dread &amp; Circuses trying to reason with the girls of JGT re: their transphobia, and arguably cemented JGT as the &#34;TERF GoI&#34;. In my opinion, its biggest problem was too much tell re: why transphobia is bad; my job was to chop it all up and //show// the sheer horrors of &#34;traditional femininity&#34;. I, uh, succeeded, according to the comments.
* This piece did not originally come with an on-page warning, which I dislike including wholesale onto a page unless absolutely necessary. As it turns out, my decision to have such warnings languish in this tabview resulted in triggering someone&#39;s PTSD; not including the warning after such would be tantamount to dangerous negligence.
* I set out to make this piece horrifying from the perspective of software developers and trans people; I didn&#39;t expect the horror to produce such visceral reactions, and to this day I&#39;m a little frightened of the implications that I could just //write// such a thing.
* PINK FLY has cameo&#39;d in [[[degenerate-art|another tale]]].
[[[SCP-5994]]]
* There are some things you will never understand.
[[[bawarao-hub|Black and White and Red All Over]]]
&gt; //Apparently you fuckers didn&#39;t learn the first time. How about a round 2?//
* IntCon2019 was a very... peculiar contest, but I knew the minute I stepped into the ring what I wanted to write. As 3721 shows, I&#39;m not too much of a fan on most people&#39;s takes on paranormal neo-nazis; if I didn&#39;t take 4R and write it myself, I knew I&#39;d inevitably hate whatever was written about them.
* -DE hates this series, but acknowledges that it&#39;s well-written. Sometimes, the highest praise comes from those who hold you in the lowest regard.
* I think the ultimate moral of this series is that fascism is an inconsistent garbage ideology for insecure losers, and ultimately it doesn&#39;t even make you happy.
[[[SCP-5947]]]
&gt; //The grind, the grind, the __grind__ of it all! A god&#39;s work is never done, Dr. Regan, so either pick up your wrench or offer yourself upon the altar to our glory!//
* SILVERFISH was part of Corpsecon, a contest where someone submitted containment procedures and someone else would write for them. Mine were written by [[*user MaliceAforethought]]
* This piece is based on a specific period of time during my tenure as SCP staff, wherein I was obsessed with &#34;protecting&#34; the wiki at any cost. Add Smith to the self-insert pile, I guess.
* This marks the first article proper on the wiki to mention SoI-004; funnily enough, it isn&#39;t even part of the canon I introduced them in.
**Christ in Scarlet** ([[[SCP-5952]]], [[[A Dove in a Chicken Pen]]], [[[SCP-3178]]])
&gt; //&#34;You&#39;re sick. I&#39;ll never let you get away with this.&#34;//
&gt; 
&gt; //&#34;Were you always this cliché, Princess?&#34;//
* Christ in Scarlet arguably kicks off &#34;Act Three&#34; of the Trashfire, introducing and developing a lot of the themes planned for later installments. It&#39;s also just fun to write.
* Almost on accident, I&#39;ve found myself debating whether each piece in the series will be the one that goes &#34;too far&#34;. Hell, the series is about a rapacious demon overtaking one of the largest religions in the world; already I&#39;m alienating a good chunk of my audience. From the reception I&#39;ve gotten, however, doesn&#39;t look like I need to worry too much.

[[tab UElore]]
* **Chaz Ambrose is Mr. Redd&#39;s son:** He started Ambrose to piss off his dad, but it backfired because his restaurants cause strife and argument in the human world.
* **Beryllium-bronze conducts consciousness:** The primary purpose of BB materials is to channel, project, or interfere with electric and psychic signals associated with consciousness.
* **Robert Bumaro and the Prophet who faced Ion&#39;s army are different people:** Robert Bumaro may claim to be the Prophet of Mekhane (and might be? who knows), but he wasn&#39;t Enoch the Builder, who was killed in the final siege that broke the Adytite Empire.
* **The Foundation is privately or covertly funded:** Governments fund a single normalcy organization, either the Global Occult Coalition or a nationalized one, and don&#39;t really rely on others.
* **Mekhane is an artificial god:** There existed no actual Mekhane until the Mekhanite Empire, when it was constructed from bronze, iron, and the collective consciousness of its classical cultists. It was killed by Orok in the deciding battle of the First Occult War, but put up a good enough fight before the end.
* **There are multiple 001s:** These include Tufto&#39;s Proposal as well as whatever&#39;s hiding under Site-56. Gate Guardian and The Placeholder are not only //not// a true 001, they&#39;re not even present as //fake// 001s (this is true across all metaverses and their associated multiverses and //their// associated universes).

[[tab What I&#39;ve Learned From Writing]]
[[[SCP-1285]]]
* Do not be afraid to go weird.
* Behind every criticism is a suggestion for what to do better.
[[[SCP-2677]]]
* Extraneous logs will cripple a piece. Only say what you need to.
[[[SCP-3428]]]
* Comedy must be built up from.
[[[SCP-952]]]
* Everyone loves a good character.
* The worst human villains are still human at the end of the day. If you can understand why someone did something, part of you will unconsciously empathize.
[[[SCP-4947]]]
* Gimmicks can only go so far, even if they&#39;re necessary to explore the themes of a piece. Try not to rely on a given gimmick too hard.
[[[SCP-3721]]]
* Prose can be timed for maximum effect, most especially when writing horror (and, by extension, comedy).
[[[SCP-4690]]]
* All comedy pieces have a punchline, but //great// comedy pieces realize that build-up isn&#39;t linear. Peppering your piece with brief jokes can strengthen the piece immensely.
