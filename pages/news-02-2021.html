You will notice little &#39;📈&#39; emojis beside some articles. That denotes SCP articles which were under 30 and tales which were under 20 when this edition of site news was posted. Give them a little love! Speaking from personal experience, the most frustrating thing that can happen to an article is not deletion, but stagnating below 20 without any comments. So try to read, vote, and comment on these articles! They&#39;re often hidden gems :)

+++ Staff Spotlight

**February spotlight:** Forum Crit
**Featuring:** cybersqyd
**Interviewer:** MalyceGraves

------

Thank you for interviewing with me today about Forum Crit! Do you mind giving me a brief overview of the team? What it does, what it hopes to do, maybe what it has accomplished?

&gt; Forum crit is uh, generally wrangling the forums. We are broadly in charge of providing critique on both concepts and drafts; answering miscellaneous questions about writing in the help forums; and generally ensuring that everyone using the forums is doing so according to the rules (so shutting down poor critique, guiding people towards the right forum for their issue etc.).

So, a bit of moderation, a bit of crit, a bit of help desk?

&gt; Yeah, pretty much! Obviously other teams help with help desk stuff too; e.g. licensing when people ask about doing youtube channels and tech when folk ask about like, coding stuff for their articles. I guess a lot of ours hopes are reflected in this: we want the forums to run nicely, with people helping to pitch in and not leave us to do all the work; and per the rules we set out that aim to help folk use the forums efficiently, y&#39;know?

What&#39;s your role in the team? Could you walk me through a bit of what you do?

&gt; I guess my role on the team is generally y&#39;know, doing the stuff the team does; a lot of my day to day staff activity is keeping an eye on the forums and answering PM requests for crit. I generally try to keep a broad eye on the site and spot e.g. bad edits and stuff as it comes up; but that&#39;s not really a forum crit thing per se. There&#39;s some behind the scenes management too; like, finding folk to look at drafts threads and getting mods around to lock duplicate threads and stuff

Do you have a particular aspect of the job that you like more than the others?

&gt; I quietly really enjoy doing draft critique; particularly in the forums. There&#39;s a kinda, almost zen feeling when going through a draft thoroughly and like, finding any minor grammatical errors and stuff like that; followed by an almost... problem solving-esque thing at the end where you&#39;re like... trying to figure out how to make the draft better?

I&#39;m sure you run into a lot of drafts that really aren&#39;t great, but have you ever run into any that you&#39;re like &#34;oh man, this is awesome?&#34;
&gt; I think probably one of my favourite ended up becoming [http://scpwiki.com/scp-4581 SCP-4581]; where like...there was a lot of great writing and a few weaker plot angles and I pointed &#39;em out and it become something really nice
We&#39;ve kinda already shifted into the next thing I wanted to cover, but I also want to ask why you joined FC in the first place? What drew you to that team?
&gt; I guess this kinda ties into me enjoying doing critique in general; I ended up in FC as a result of me spending far too much time doing it and eventually Zyn was forced to give up and invite me to join ;p [http://scpwiki.com/scp-4793 Dyslexion&#39;s SCP-4793] was specifically cited as &#39;the thing I crit which caused Zyn to invite me&#39; which is kinda cool

Do you have a kind of fiction you particularly like to read? Like, what kind of flavor do you like your drafts/skips? Mystery, weird shit, body horror?

&gt; I tend to lean towards liking more horror/sci-fi esque stuff in general; as well as stuff that tries to be pretty experimental with the format... I also have a huge soft spot for like, heartwarming stuff?

Is there a skip/tale on the site that really stands out to you? One you really vibe with?

&gt; Is it cheating to pick the whole &#39;[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-cool-war-hub The Cool War]&#39; for this considering it&#39;s a series instead of a single article?

Not at all. Pick what you jive with, I say

&gt; [http://scpwiki.com/scp-3794 SCP-3794] and [http://scpwiki.com/scp-5811 SCP-5811] are like, two of my goto things too; as is basically anything by [http://www.scpwiki.com/captain-kirby-s-personal-file Captain Kirby]

Kirby is great. He&#39;s got a distinctive style that is a pleasure to read
&gt; yeah. He&#39;s probably the best character focused author on the site?

I&#39;d agree with that. His stuff is consistently good. Last question: Have you done or read anything site-related recently that had you laughing?

&gt; Tuomey&#39;s memes

He does have a bunch of good ones
&gt; I think just, the general sharing of goofy memes in SSSC in general is like. one of my favourite things? Like, it&#39;s not all hard work and sisyphean tasks, sometimes it&#39;s TSAT or Tuomey or Kens or w/e sharing silly images that are just...fun?

I feel that. So, turns out I lied, I&#39;ve got one more question for you. Talking about memes and staff interaction, is that part of what keeps you here? We&#39;re all volunteers, so none of us HAS to be here. What keeps you involved?

&gt; There&#39;s a lot tbh. Like, part of it is y&#39;know, me enjoying the actual forum crit work; part is that I enjoy the writing and I enjoy being involved in the creation of more writing even if I don&#39;t write that often; and part of it is the community. Like, not just other staffers but all the various cool people I hang out with each day, y&#39;know?

Oh, for sure. There are deffo some people, not all staff, that I absolutely look forward to speaking with every day
&gt; yeah. I think the site is at it&#39;s best when it feels like a community

A: Absolutely. You will always have that option at any point.

++* Q: I noticed an error/typo/incorrect information and wish to correct it. May I?

A: Sure! If the changes are not limited to your own article(s) and/or are substantial changes across multiple entries, you should post in that month&#39;s discussion page and then make the changes.

A: Yup! It&#39;s much easier if you come to us about it, and it gives you the control over what you want shown on the news page.
