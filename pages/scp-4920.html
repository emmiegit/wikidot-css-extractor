**Item #:** SCP-4920

**Object Class:** Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** The area surrounding Site Umbra-4920 is to be declared a nuclear testing site, and is off limits to civilians and other non-Foundation personnel. Due to the nature of the anomaly, SCP-4920 is to be contained inside a sub-site, with a functional staff centre for all assigned personnel. Any anomalous activity around SCP-4920 is to be reported immediately to the current project manager and site director.

**Description:** SCP-4920 is a train station located in [DATA EXPUNGED], United States of America. The station platform is twenty meters long and made of concrete. There is a single wooden shelter near the centre of the platform. There are no tracks going into or out of SCP-4920, and --no train has ever been observed passing through the station-- only one train has ever passed through the station. Tests on the platform and the shelter showed it to be indestructible, although this changed after Incident 4920-A. SCP-4920 may also have time-bending properties, as SCP-4920-1 appears much younger than is possible.

SCP-4920-1 was a human figure, approximately 1.8 m, which inhabited SCP-4920. SCP-4920-1 was dressed in a simple brown suit, and, when questioned, confirmed its age to be near 60. When questioned as to why it was staying in this location, it simply stated that it was &#34;waiting for the train&#34;, despite the lack of railroad lines in or around the station. SCP-4920 showed no sign of an anomaly, apart from its refusal to leave the station, despite Foundation efforts.

SCP-4920-1 has been interviewed several times by Foundation personnel, and shows no signs of hostility or fear. SCP-4920-1 prefers to be called &#34;Maxwell&#34; by personnel. According to Researcher Calloway, SCP-4920-1 strongly resembles his great grandfather, although the subject in question was reported dead fifty years ago. Due to his prior knowledge of SCP-4920-1, Researcher Calloway was allowed to interview SCP-4920-1, although this privilege shall be revoked if he shows any sign of interfering with tests done.

**Incident 4920-A**
At 0900 hours, █/██/2014, SCP-4920-1 was observed checking its wristwatch regularly. This was dismissed as unimportant. This activity continued, and was noted by the research team. Researcher Calloway was dispatched to question SCP-4920-1 on this activity. When questioned, SCP-4920-1 simply remarked that &#34;the train was almost here&#34;. Foundation personnel in the area went on alert, and prepared themselves to view and record any activity. Researcher Calloway stayed on the platform of SCP-4920, to continue conversing with SCP-4920-1.

At 1200 hours, a thick fog descended upon the surrounding area, obscuring view and causing equipment malfunctions. Personnel stationed at SCP-4920 reported hearing a train&#39;s whistle, before the fog cleared a few minutes later. SCP-4920-1 was missing, and Researcher Calloway was standing on the platform looking stunned. He was later interrogated about his encounter.

Further tests on the platform and shelter showed small amounts of wear, and personnel were able to damage the platform and shelter. After four weeks of observation, SCP-4920 was declared neutralised.

__**Interview 4920-A**__
&gt; **Interviewer:** Researcher Calloway
&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-4920-1
&gt; 
&gt; **Begin Log**
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-4920-1 is seated at the shelter in the station. Researcher Calloway approaches the subject.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Calloway:** Good morning, SCP-4920-1.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4920-1:** Hello, young chap. But please, call me Max.
&gt; 
&gt; **Calloway:** Very well, Max. I have a few questions to ask you.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4920-1:** That&#39;s fine, lad. Well, best start asking, then.
&gt; 
&gt; //Calloway looks unsettled, then proceeds.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Calloway:** When did you first discover SCP-4920?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4920-1:** Ah, I remember the day. I was a young thing back then, much like you, eh? I thought I could understand everything. Until I heard of the train. The train that could take you anywhere you wanted. I had to find it, of course, and see the world. So I set out on a long journey. I made many friends on the way, and learned a great deal about the train I was travelling to. I searched and searched for years, and finally, my efforts were rewarded. I found the station. I was overjoyed, and my friends were too, but it wasn&#39;t over yet. We waited for hours, days. No train came. I was so disappointed. My friends were too. Eventually, we gave up hope. We turned to go back, but we saw some other people. People who wanted to take the train for themselves, and would do anything to get it. We argued, and our arguments came to a head. A fight happened, and blood was spilled. My friends died that day. I was the only survivor.
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-4920-1 seems lost in thought.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4920-1:** I was weepin&#39; over their bodies, and I saw the strangest thing. I saw a great train in the sky, and I saw my friends on board, wavin&#39; at me. That&#39;s when I knew that you couldn&#39;t rush the train. It came to you, not the other way round. So I walked back to the station, and I sat. And now you&#39;ve found me here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Calloway:** Describe this... train.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4920-1:** Well, it was mighty fine. All fancy carriages and big wheels.
&gt; 
&gt; **Calloway:** Would you describe it as sinister?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4920-1:** No, no, not at all! In fact, it seemed like the near best thing in the world.
&gt; 
&gt; //Interview end.//

//Note: Interesting. This may show early intervention from a GOI such as the Serpent&#39;s Hand.//

__**Interview 4920-B**__
&gt; **Interviewer:** Researcher Calloway
&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-4920-1
&gt; 
&gt; **Calloway:** Good morning, Max.
&gt; 
&gt; //Researcher Calloway was reminded to use correct terminology.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Calloway:** Sorry. Good morning, SCP-4920-1.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4920-1:** Hello again, son. And I told you, you can call me Max.
&gt; 
&gt; **Calloway:** Sorry, but I&#39;m not allowed to.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4920-1:** Ah, well. We all got rules we gotta follow, don&#39;t we?
&gt; 
&gt; **Calloway:** I&#39;m afraid so. Tell me, do you have any family?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4920-1:** Well, &#39;course, everyone&#39;s got family. Even you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Calloway:** I... 
&gt; 
&gt; //Researcher Calloway covers his microphone. A warning is issued, and he removes his hand.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4920-1:** Ah, I thought I recognized you! You&#39;re Mary&#39;s boy, aren&#39;t you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Calloway:** I...
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4920-1:** I was there at her funeral, remember? We talked about old times.
&gt; 
&gt; //Researcher Calloway becomes distressed, and the interview is cut short.//

//Note: Should Calloway let his emotions get in the way of an interview again, we shall reassign him.//

//Note: It won&#39;t happen again. But the funeral was in 2001. He couldn&#39;t have been there, we thought he was dead at the time. And I don&#39;t remember him being there either. -Researcher Calloway//

__**Interview 4920-C**__
&gt; **Interviewer:** Researcher Calloway
&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-4920-1
&gt; //Note: Calloway was briefed prior to this interview, and knows the cost of another incident like last time.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Calloway:** Good morning, SCP-4920-1.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4920-1:** Would it kill you to call me Grandpa?
&gt; 
&gt; **Calloway:** You know I can&#39;t do that.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4920-1:** Sorry, son. Question away.
&gt; 
&gt; **Calloway:** Can you give me an exact date as to when you came here?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4920-1:** Well, I kinda lost track of time, but I reckon it musta been somewhere around 1920.
&gt; 
&gt; **Calloway:** That&#39;s nearly a hundred years ago.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4920-1:** Really? How time flies.
&gt; 
&gt; **Calloway:** That&#39;s an abnormally long life. Do you know why you lived so long?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4920-1:** Well, when you&#39;re waiting for the train, things seem... I dunno, faster.
&gt; 
&gt; **Calloway:** Please explain.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4920-1:** No, enough about me. I wanna hear about my grandson. How&#39;s life for you, eh?
&gt; 
&gt; **Calloway:** That&#39;s unimportant, now will you please-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4920-1:** I think it&#39;s very important. You should have a job that makes you happy. Are you happy in life, son?
&gt; 
&gt; **Calloway:** Just answer the question!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4920-1:** Fine, fine. It&#39;s like things happen faster. When it&#39;s boring, the time seems to fly past. And when it&#39;s interesting, things slow right down, so I can have a nice conversation once in a while.
&gt; 
&gt; **Calloway:** Thanks. I&#39;m sorry, I have to do my job. Do you know if anyone else is on the train?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4920-1:** Of course! Everyone ends up on the train, eventually. Just some get there sooner than others. Some people spend their whole life trying to avoid the train, only to figure out there isn&#39;t a way around it.
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-4920-1 looks towards the sky. Faint thunder is heard.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4920-1:** You should head on back, son. Looks like it&#39;s gonna rain soon.
&gt; 
&gt; **End Log**

//Note: This interview was two days before incident 4920-A. No more information was gleaned from SCP-4920-1.//

[[collapsible show=&#34;Interview with R. Calloway after Incident 4920-A&#34; hide=&#34;Close&#34;]]
__**Researcher Calloway&#39;s interview after incident 4920-A.**__
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Ricardo
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewed:** Researcher Calloway
&gt; 
&gt; **Ricardo:** Hello, Fletcher. Please have a seat.
&gt; 
&gt; **Calloway:** Hey, Rick. Look, I don&#39;t really want to talk-
&gt; 
&gt; **Ricardo:** I have a job to do, and I plan to do it. Unlike certain people.
&gt; 
&gt; //Calloway is silent//
&gt; 
&gt; **Ricardo:** Thank you. Now, we noticed you were the only one on the platform when the &#39;train&#39; arrived. Can you tell us about what you experienced?
&gt; 
&gt; **Calloway:** I guess. It got all foggy, and then a train showed up. He hopped on, and it left. Is that all you wanted to know?
&gt; 
&gt; **Ricardo:** If you&#39;re going to be like this, then I&#39;ll have to call in an interrogator. I don&#39;t want to do that to a friend, so just tell me the full story.
&gt; 
&gt; **Calloway:** Fine. Fine, I&#39;ll tell you. I was on the platform, and it got really foggy. Like, I could barely see at all. Fog so thick I couldn&#39;t even see Gran-... sorry, Max. I tried to get clear, and stepped into the centre of the platform, and it was like I came out of a cloud. It was perfectly clear in there, and Max was standing in the middle of the platform. I heard this huge whistling, and then he just... I can&#39;t explain it. It made no sense, but the basic idea is he disappeared into the train. It was there and not there at the same time. And he smiled at me out the window. It just pulled away, leaving me at the platform alone. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Ricardo:** Thank you. You-
&gt; 
&gt; **Calloway:** He was the only family I had. And now he&#39;s gone.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ricardo:** Thank you for your time. You may go now.
&gt; 
&gt; **End Log**

[[collapsible show=&#34;Note Found in R. Calloway&#39;s room&#34; hide=&#34;Close&#34;]]
&gt; To whoever finds this note,
&gt; 
&gt; I quit. I know that I should be amnestized, or retired more permanently, but I quit. I just lost the first person I considered family in ten years, and the Foundation doesn&#39;t even care. They just dump me back into my old job, looking at papers, and typing pages, and doing tests on people I don&#39;t actually want to hurt. 
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I&#39;m done. Consider this my official resignation form. I know what I have to do. I know where I have to go. I&#39;ll see him again, I have a lot of questions for him to answer.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, must be off. Can&#39;t miss my train.

//Researcher Calloway is officially a rogue personnel, and is to be detained on sight.//
