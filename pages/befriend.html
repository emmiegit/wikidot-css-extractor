Dr. Bechert took a sip from his coffee before he returned his attention to the letters on the table in front of him. He scratched his head, trying to make sense of some of the notes.

&#34;Just drop it. You&#39;re not gonna find anything new,&#34; a voice from behind him said. Dr. Bechert turned around already knowing who the voice belonged to.

&#34;Dr. Cimmerian? You&#39;re still here?&#34;

&#34;Yeah.. something&#39;s missing... Once we activated the femur breaker, 106 released 682 out of its pocket dimension.&#34;

&#34;So? It&#39;s just another failed attempt to get rid of the lizard for good. Not even the old man wanted to keep him.&#34;

Dr. Bechert went silent for a moment before returning his focus back to the files. “I&#39;m sure there is more to this.&#34;

&#34;Maybe, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not important enough to spend your time on.&#34;

Dr Bechert chuckled. &#34;I&#39;m not on the clock, Cimm.&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s worse. You clocked out to do some extra work. When&#39;s the last time you just relaxed for a day?&#34;

&#34;Been a while.&#34;

Cimmerian rolled his eyes. &#34;Just make sure you&#39;re fit for your actual shift.&#34;

Dr. Bechert nodded.

Cimmerian shook his head and left the room.

The man leaned back in his chair, looking over the scattered notes, files and pictures. He took his glasses off and rubbed his eyes with a soft sigh.

&#34;Something&#39;s missing...&#34;

Bechert shifted his attention to 682&#39;s file.
Something caught his eye, a cross-test from not too long ago with the Gate Guardian.

He smiled to himself as he began to read over the file.

“There&#39;s a 7-minute break before 001 attacks the Lizard and defeats him.//”
He paused. &#34;Did they speak?&#34; 

Dr. Bechert&#39;s eyes lit up. It would certainly explain how 682 got so close in the first place.
He put the papers down and smiled a little.
---

Dr. Bechert straightened his tie. 

An old man with long white hair was already sitting on a chair, smiling softly at the rather unexpected visitor and the bag he was holding.

&#34;Good Day, 343. I hope you don&#39;t mind the unannounced visit.&#34;

&#34;You know that I prefer to be addressed differently.&#34; The man responded.

&#34;Of course. So... I got you a burger. Hope you like it.&#34;

&#34;That is very kind of you. Thank you.&#34;

&#34;I assume you also know that I&#39;m not just here for a simple chat?&#34;

&#34;You want to know what Uriel and the Lizard talked about during their little meeting?&#34;

&#34;Yes.&#34;

343 took the burger from the bag and took a bite from it. He smiled softly.

&#34;It&#39;s good.&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s not an answer.&#34;

&#34;Oh, but it is. You simply lack the knowledge and wisdom to interpret the meaning.&#34;

Dr. Bechert groaned and placed the files in front of 343.

&#34;Please. Just... take a look.&#34;

The older man raised an eyebrow and reached for the papers. A smile formed on his lips.

&#34;Interesting. You were always quite the curious one.&#34;

&#34;You said something about wisdom?&#34;

343 chuckled in response.
&#34;It is not wise to seek knowledge that was never meant for a mortal mind.&#34;

&#34;So there is some kind of forbidden Knowledge?&#34;

343 paused and placed the papers back down.
&#34;I will not tell you what they spoke about. But if you&#39;re really that curious, just ask him.&#34;

Dr. Bechert looked at him for a moment.

&#34;So... you want me to go talk to the Gate Guardian. An entity that is known for sending everyone away that dares to approach him. And obliterating them with his flaming sword if they don&#39;t do so?&#34;

&#34;That is exactly what I&#39;m saying.&#34;

&#34;Uh.. I don&#39;t-&#34;

&#34;If you want to know, you will have to get closer. Now please excuse me, I&#39;d like to enjoy the rest of my burger.&#34;

&#34;Just... one more question. Why wouldn&#39;t you tell us anything about 682? Why only now, when directly asked about it?&#34;

343 paused, a slight smile forming on his lips.

&#34;As I have said many times before. The things you do not know will not harm you. That is a truth you should know, for your own sake.&#34;

Before Dr. Bechert could reply, 343 disappeared. 

Bechert stood there for a second, not knowing what to do.

He sighed and shook his head.

&#34;This is so stupid.&#34;
He left the interview room, not knowing what the consequences would be.
---

&#34;I still think this is a stupid Idea.&#34;

Dr. Bechert sighed in response. &#34;I know Cimm. You&#39;ve told me. 5 times now.&#34;

&#34;Because it&#39;s a stupid idea.”

&#34;Yeah, I know. But 343 made it seem like a good idea.&#34;

&#34;I think you need to reflect on the wisdom of that statement.&#34;

&#34;The positive outcomes outweigh the negatives, Cimm.&#34;

&#34;Anyway. I got your request approved. You&#39;ll fly by plane and helicopter to Containment Site 0. If under any circumstances you hear it in your head, obey the commands. I don&#39;t want to have to file a report about why one of the Ethics Committee&#39;s employees got evaporated.&#34;

&#34;Thank you Cimmerian. I&#39;ll be back soon.&#34;

Dr. Cimmerian sighed as he watched the tall man enter the elevator. 


2 days Later.

After a long flight, Dr. Bechert finally touched the ground. He was greeted by the only person that was manning the site.

The man handed Bechert the keys to a jeep, and the doctor started to drive.

As the Sun began to set, Bechert finally reached the edge of 001&#39;s territory. He stopped the car and took a deep breath.

&#34;Here goes nothing..&#34;

He slowly stepped out of the car. He walked past the warning signs. From where he stood he could already see the anomaly, a giant man, floating in the air, holding a burning sword, bathed in bright white light.

He kept walking, the sword following his every movement. 
He kept his eyes fixated on the figure above him.

&#34;Hello. My name is Dr. Andre Bechert and I would like to speak with you. Is that alright?&#34;

The figure did not respond.

&#34;I know, I must be a strange sight, but I have no intention of fighting you, hurting you, or anything else. I just want to talk.&#34;

The figure turned his head a little. He could feel interest as its voice echoed through his head.
 
&#34;SPEAK&#34;

&#34;I...&#34; Bechert sighed. &#34;When you and SCP-682 fought, you didn&#39;t send him away like you do with everything else. Instead, you let him approach you. What did you two talk about?&#34;

The angelic figure was silent for a second. &#34;HE, WHO HAD CORRUPTED THE VISION OF MY LORD.&#34;

&#34;Corrupted the vision of your lord? As far as I know, you&#39;re guarding the Gates to the Garden of Eden. Are you talking about the serpent?&#34;

&#34;FOR HIS TRANSGRESSIONS MY LORD PUNISHED HIM TO SUFFER FOR ETERNITY, UNDYING.&#34;

&#34;Why did he turn into a Reptile though? Did God choose that Form? Or was it an accident?&#34;

&#34;IT IS NOT OUR PLACE TO QUESTION HIS DECISIONS.&#34;

&#34;Uh.. sorry. So he can&#39;t die, no matter what we try. Correct?&#34;

&#34;YES.&#34;

&#34;And-&#34;

&#34;ENOUGH.&#34; The guardian&#39;s voice commanded him. &#34;LEAVE, PREPARE, BEFRIEND.&#34;

The commands echoed through Dr. Bechert&#39;s head. He felt dizzy for a second, yet it was gone as fast as it came.

He took a deep breath and nodded.

&#34;Of course.&#34;

He turned around and began walking. He had a lot of new information, but he also had more questions than answers.
---

682 stared into the Observation Room, looking at Bechert.

It was growling in anger, his teeth grinding together as it would&#39;ve loved to just rip the two doctors apart.

Dr. Bechert took a deep breath, trying to calm his nerves, before looking down to the Reptile.

&#34;You&#39;re a fucking moron.&#34; 682 growled.

&#34;And you&#39;re a snake.&#34;

The Reptile seemed caught off guard.

&#34;What?&#34;

&#34;You&#39;re the serpent of Eden, aren&#39;t you? Banished from the garden for going against your lord&#39;s will.&#34;

682 paused. &#34;So.. he told you?&#34;

&#34;Yes. And he didn&#39;t exactly seem thrilled by what you did.&#34;

&#34;Tch, figures.&#34;

&#34;Look, I know that you probably won&#39;t care, but I&#39;ve cancelled the termination tests.&#34;

&#34;And why is that?&#34;

&#34;Because its pointless. And apparently, we need you.&#34;

682 chuckled. &#34;Need me for what?&#34;

&#34;I honestly don&#39;t know. I hate that I have to trust him, but that was his command.&#34;

&#34;You&#39;re not seriously thinking about listening to an angel, are you?&#34;

&#34;Yes. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen, but I&#39;d rather have you with us.&#34;

682&#39;s eyes examined Bechert, who continued.

&#34;Isn&#39;t it extreme to banish someone for something like that?&#34; Dr. Bechert pondered.

&#34;Why should I care about that old fuck?&#34; 682 snarled.

&#34;Because they may let you back into the garden.”

682&#39;s eyes narrowed as he stared at the man above him.

&#34;What exactly do you want from me?&#34;

&#34;I want you to listen, to not fight, and to maybe... give us a chance. That&#39;s all I ask for.&#34;

682 snorted. &#34;I&#39;m not a fucking pet.&#34;

&#34;How about we call it a partnership? Or Alliance. I know you hate us. And I can understand why. Could you look past it? If it works you could go back to Eden. If not, then you lose nothing except a little time from your immortal life.&#34;

682 growled as he thought about the man&#39;s offer.

&#34;And what would you get out of this arrangement?&#34;

&#34;If what 001 said is true, we would be keeping humanity safe from a much bigger threat.&#34;

682 stared at the Doctor. &#34;You really think I&#39;m going to play nice with people who&#39;ve done nothing but torment and torture me?&#34;

&#34;If you&#39;re willing to play along, then so are we. But that&#39;s your choice. However, there will be no further tests or termination attempts as long as you do cooperate.&#34;

682 remained silent, his eyes fixated on the Doctor.
&#34;So... what do you say?&#34;

&#34;I agree.&#34;

Dr. Bechert smiled lightly. &#34;I&#39;ll make sure they won&#39;t pester you too much.&#34;

&#34;They better.&#34;

&#34;I&#39;ll be going now. I&#39;ll come around tomorrow to talk.&#34;

&#34;Sure.&#34;

&#34;Thank you.&#34;

682 grumbled and laid down, turning his attention away from the doctor as he closed his eyes to rest.</textarea></pre>
