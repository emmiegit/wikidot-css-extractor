__SUMMARY__
Dr. Everwood is a bright and cheerful person, despite her appearance. She has short brown hair, green eyes, and looks tired most of the time. Is missing her right arm, which she lost in a [DATA EXPUNGED] incident. Doesn&#39;t like her prosthetic arm but wears it when necessary. Despite her snark and grump, she knows how to have fun and likes doing so. Identifies as female, but looks relatively androgynous and likes it that way. Born and raised in Florida. Speaks Spanish and English.

You can use her as a GoI specialist if you like, as that&#39;s what she enjoys.
Works for the UIU as a rookie agent in the Aces and Eights canon.
Lead Dr. Wondertainment researcher in Wonderful World canon.
Administrator in the canon of [[[SCP-4224]]]

__HOW DOES SHE LIKE HER COFFEE?__
Prefers bubble tea, but if forced to drink coffee likes espresso with a little bit of sugar.
__HOW OFTEN DOES SHE SAY USE SWEARS__
Sometimes.

LOVINGLY MADE WITH MY FRIEND AND PAL DARKSTUFF

__SUMMARY__
Faeowynn Wilson (born Felix Wilson) is Tim Wilson&#39;s daughter and the second person to run Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions. She is very intelligent and inherited her father&#39;s love for animals, but is a lot more competent and responsible than him. Is a very &#39;no-nonsense&#39; person. She is tan, has shoulder length hair, brown eyes, has an athletic body type, and is often seen wearing a WWS-embroidered khaki shirt and shorts. Smells of sunscreen. Is dating fellow WWS volunteer Alex Molina.
Dislikes Marshall Carter and Dark.
Is friends with Holly &#39;Wondertainment&#39; Light in Wonderful World canon.
Is aware of Three Portlands and the Wanderer&#39;s Library.

__HOW DOES SHE LIKE HER COFFEE?__
Pitch black.

__HOW OFTEN DOES SHE SWEAR?__
In front of her dad? Never. Elsewhere? depends on how angry she is.

++ __like my stuff?__
aw shucks, thanks. i&#39;m open for collabs almost all the time, so just hit me up. it helps if you have an idea though, so don&#39;t just come up to me asking to write. 



++ __srs bznz__
[[/=]]
in the event something happens to me and i disappear for 5 years or die, i leave all my non-collab articles entrusted to [[*user aismallard]], and all my collab articles with the respective co-authors. The only exception to this is [[[moon-champion-s-cinco-de-mayo-extravaganza|moon champion&#39;s cinco de mayo extravaganza]]], which would be left to [[*user cadavercommander]]. if i need to be contacted for whatever reason, [[*user NatVoltaic]], [[*user dolphinslugchugger]], and [[*user Varaxous]] have my phone number.
