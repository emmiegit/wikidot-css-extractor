__SUMMARY__
Dr. Everwood is a bright and cheerful person, despite their somewhat glum appearance. They have short brown hair, green eyes, and look tired most of the time. Is missing their right arm, which they lost in a [DATA EXPUNGED] incident. Doesn&#39;t like the prosthetic arm but wears it when necessary. Despite their snark and grump, they know how to have fun and like doing so. Identifies as nonbinary, but still responds to female pronouns despite looking very androgynous (and liking it that way). Born and raised in Florida. Speaks Spanish and English. Has a tendency to ramble.

You can use them as a GoI specialist if you like, as that&#39;s what they enjoy.
Works for the UIU as a rookie agent in the Aces and Eights canon.
Lead Dr. Wondertainment researcher in Wonderful World canon.
Administrator in the canon of [[[SCP-4224]]]

LOVINGLY MADE WITH MY FRIEND AND PAL DARKSTUFF

__SUMMARY__
Faeowynn Wilson (born Felix Wilson) is Tim Wilson&#39;s daughter and the second person to run Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions. She is very intelligent and inherited her father&#39;s love for animals, but is a lot more competent and responsible than him. Is a very &#39;no-nonsense&#39; person. She is tan, has shoulder length hair, brown eyes, has an athletic body type, and is often seen wearing a WWS-embroidered khaki shirt and shorts. Smells of sunscreen. Is dating fellow WWS volunteer Alex Molina. She went to college at NYU for Accounting. She has a love for cooking that isn&#39;t often explored because she&#39;s very busy dealing with Wilson&#39;s.
Dislikes Marshall Carter and Dark.
Is friends with Holly &#39;Wondertainment&#39; Light in Wonderful World canon.
Is aware of Three Portlands and the Wanderer&#39;s Library.
Goes by &#39;JuliaChildEnthusiast&#39; on GAW chatrooms. Is friends with Jude Kriyot and Esther Kogan.

__HOW DOES SHE LIKE HER COFFEE?__
Pitch black.
__HOW OFTEN DOES SHE SWEAR?__
In front of her dad? Never. Elsewhere? depends on how angry she is.
