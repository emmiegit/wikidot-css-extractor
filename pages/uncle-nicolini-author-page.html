__SUMMARY__
Dr. Everwood is a bright and cheerful person, despite their somewhat glum appearance. They have short brown hair, green eyes, and look tired most of the time. Is missing their right arm, which they lost in a [DATA EXPUNGED] incident. Doesn&#39;t like the prosthetic arm but wears it when necessary. Despite their snark and grump, they know how to have fun and like doing so. Identifies as nonbinary, but still responds to female pronouns despite looking very androgynous (and liking it that way). Born and raised in Florida. Speaks Spanish and English. Has a tendency to ramble.

You can use them as a GoI specialist if you like, as that&#39;s what they enjoy.
Works for the UIU as a rookie agent in the Aces and Eights canon.
Lead Dr. Wondertainment researcher in Wonderful World canon.
Administrator in the canon of [[[SCP-4224]]]

LOVINGLY MADE WITH MY FRIEND AND PAL DARKSTUFF

__SUMMARY__
Faeowynn Wilson (born Felix Wilson) is Tim Wilson&#39;s daughter and the second person to run Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions. She is very intelligent and inherited her father&#39;s love for animals, but is a lot more competent and responsible than him. Is a very &#39;no-nonsense&#39; person. She is tan, has shoulder length hair, brown eyes, has an athletic body type, and is often seen wearing a WWS-embroidered khaki shirt and shorts. Smells of sunscreen. Is dating fellow WWS volunteer Alex Molina. She went to college at NYU for Accounting. She has a love for cooking that isn&#39;t often explored because she&#39;s very busy dealing with Wilson&#39;s.
Dislikes Marshall Carter and Dark.
Is friends with Holly &#39;Wondertainment&#39; Light in Wonderful World canon.

__SUMMARY__

Rex Alces (born Gracie Alces) is an awkward individual. He doesn&#39;t pick up well on social queues, is prone to talking too much and getting in trouble for it, and has had at least one run-in with the Ethics Committee over his treatment of humanoid anomalies. Rex is a very anxious person, and is plural. His headmates are Atlas (a taxidermy enthusiast), Wally (a rather relaxed and carefree individual), and Janus (an artistically inclined person). Rex is short, has long black hair with purple streaks, and sports shitty, patchy facial hair. He works as Dr. Everwood&#39;s assistant at Site-55.

__HOW DOES HE LIKE HIS COFFEE?__
With a lot of sugar.
__HOW OFTEN DOES HE SWEAR?__
Like a god damn sailor.
