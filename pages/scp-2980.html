[[include component:image-block name=IMAG0850.jpg|caption=SCP-2980 during testing.]]
**Item #:** SCP-2980

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2980 is to be contained in a standard item locker at [http://www.scp-wiki.net/secure-facility-dossier-site-81 Site-81]. SCP-2980 may only be removed from storage for testing.

**Description:** SCP-2980 is a nondescript incandescent lightbulb of unknown make, situated on top of a standard plastic 125v wall adapter plug. The bulb itself is clear, with a standard filament and wiring system. The mounting bracket is red in color, with a &#34;smiley face&#34; logo on both sides and a small black on/off switch on the front.

When SCP-2980 is plugged into a standard 125v wall socket and turned on, regardless of whether or not the socket is currently receiving power, and when the local time reaches 2030 hours, SCP-2980 will power on and emit a red light. Any other lights in the room remaining powered at 2030 hours will dim quickly, until the only source of lighting is SCP-2980.

Upon SCP-2980 turning on, a Class V Corporeal Humanoid Entity, designated SCP-2980-1, will materialize somewhere in the room containing SCP-2980. SCP-2980-1 appears as a large, hoofed, bipedal creature, with dark red skin and curled horns. Outside of these characteristics, SCP-2980-1 appears otherwise human, with human facial features and a human torso and arms. 

For 15-30 minutes after appearing, SCP-2980-1 will proceed to read a story or collection of short stories to anyone nearby. SCP-2980-1 will read out of a small, black book with a leather binding and parchment pages. Notably, SCP-2980-1 will wear a pair of spectacles during the reading. Upon reaching the end of the tale, or if subjects listening to SCP-2980-1&#39;s reading fall asleep, SCP-2980-1 will dematerialize. SCP-2980 will remain on until powered off. Individuals who listen to the entirety of SCP-2980-1&#39;s story will invariably fall asleep at its conclusion, and awaken roughly 9 hours later. Subjects universally claim to feel well rested afterwards.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Interview with SCP-2980-1&#34; hide=&#34;- Hide Addendum&#34;]] 
//On ██/██/██, Dr. Randall entered SCP-2980&#39;s testing chamber, interrupting SCP-2980-1&#39;s story (&#34;The Tired Little Eldritch Abomination&#34;) and requesting an interview. SCP-2980-1 was eager to oblige, and the following interview took place.//

&gt; **Dr. Randall:** SCP-2980-1, thank you for sitting down with me. Can you tell me more about what caused you to be here?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2980-1:** Well doctor, I think I just got tired of doing the same old thing all the time, you know? I mean, everybody sort of gets it in their head that it&#39;s some easy thing to torture and damn people for an eternity, but it really starts to wear on you after a while. Besides, for the last thousand years or so I&#39;d really been wanting to take my writing on the road, right? Get out there and see my people. So a few months ago I loaded up my things, and well, here I am.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Randall:** I see. So the stories, they&#39;re all original?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2980-1:** Oh absolutely. A lot of it is drawn from personal experiences, stuff I encounter on a day to day basis. Pretty personal, you know. I also dabble in a lot of different works. Read a lot of different stuff by different authors. Really try and widen my horizons, right? Get a good feel of what the kids are reading nowadays.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Randall:** Of course, of course. Now, you mention children. SCP-2980 was originally discovered in an orphanage. Any reason in particular why it would&#39;ve ended up there?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2980-1:** You know, with the kids, it&#39;s really all about giving back, right? I just feel like I&#39;ve lived my whole existence and not really ever had a chance to make a difference in somebody&#39;s life. I figured, if I can help some kid rest easier at night, that&#39;s gotta count for something. Gotta make every day count. Leave the world a better place than when you found it. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Randall:** Mmhmm. Is there anything else you&#39;d like to add, SCP-2980-1?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2980-1:** Sure. I&#39;ve got a collection of bedtime stories for children coming out next spring. Really solid stuff, I mean, who am I to say anything about my own work, right? (Laughs) But seriously, the reviews are great. Check it out, definitely worth your time. Proceeds all go to the Xlan&#39;gthmr R&#39;llnmerg Foundation for Underprivileged Youth. Really great cause.

**Addendum 2980-A:** Sample of SCP-2980-1 Stories

//The following is a short sample of stories read by SCP-2980-1 during containment.//

&gt; **The Little Demon Space Cadet**
&gt; Story depicts a small demon who dreams of going to space. Small demon constructs a spaceship out of human bones, and uses it to fly to the moon. 

&gt; **Sleepy Time With GROG THE UNSPEAKABLE**
&gt; Story depicts the main character, [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1435 GROG THE UNSPEAKABLE], trying to find a suitable location to begin his millennium-long slumber. It is mentioned many times throughout that GROG is sleepy.

&gt; **Bedtime for Baby Beelzebub**
&gt; Story depicts the infant incarnation of the Lord of Flies being prepared for slumber by a large, insectine creature. Story ends with Baby Beelzebub being covered up by a blanket made of damned human souls, and falling asleep to the screams of the stricken.

&gt; **[REDACTED]**
&gt; //Story contained sensitive information about SCP-████. When questioned, SCP-2980-1 maintained that it was an original work of fiction.//

&gt; **Damnbi**
&gt; Story depicts a young deer who, disturbed emotionally by the death of its mother, signs a deal with a demon and goes on a murderous rampage after being twisted into an unholy form and falling from the sky. Story ends with Damnbi falling asleep amongst the corpses of its foes after exacting its vengeance. 

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Addendum 2980-B&#34; hide=&#34;- Hide Addendum&#34;]]
//During routine testing on ██/██/██, SCP-2980-1 told a story entitled &#34;The Little Monstrosity&#39;s Early Bedtime&#34;, depicting a [DATA EXPUNGED] going on an adventure to get home so it could be reunited with its mother and &#34;countless waiting brethren&#34;. Shortly thereafter, Site ██ experienced a breach of SCP-███, which caused ██ casualties and [DATA EXPUNGED] disappeared. Due to the similarities between SCP-███ and the creature in SCP-2980-1&#39;s story, Dr. Randall was called in to question SCP-2980-1. SCP-2980-1 responded that &#34;Well, I mean, you write what you know, right? I&#39;ve been thinking for a while, and really think I&#39;m ready to take my writing in a new direction. You can&#39;t please everybody, though, but sometimes you hit one out of the park. That&#39;s why we do it, you know? Write, I mean. It&#39;s all about pleasing an audience.&#34;//
