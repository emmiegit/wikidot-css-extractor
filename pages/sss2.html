&gt; //In the Library, there are too many stories to read in a thousand lifetimes. One may not be able even to find the stories one wants in that amount of time. The docents help, of course, but there&#39;s only so many of them, and their ways can be... alien to us. So, it&#39;s time to take matters into our own hands. It&#39;s time to begin to sort the Library.//
&gt; 
&gt; //There are hundreds of thousands of us here, each with our knowledge, our own specialties. Together we can create a catalogue, a way for future Wanderers to explore the stacks with confidence, a way to bring us together. Over time we will build. We will give form to chaos.//

+ What is the Serpentine Sorting System?
The SSS is a collaborative writing event consisting of three simple steps: the community suggests writing prompts, these prompts are voted on, and the winner becomes the basis of a whole new canon, to be built together.[[footnote]]You can see the full timeline on the right![[/footnote]]
+ Stage One: Announcement
* The event is announced on site and across social media.
* A forum thread is created for everyone to submit prompts.

+ Stage Two: Submission
* Prompt submission begins! Any user may submit ideas for a prompt or setting that will serve as the base for the canon.
* These suggestions go into the forum thread [[[https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/forum/t-15971312/serpentine-sorting-system-round-three-prompts | here.]]]
* Submissions will be open for 7 days, or until we hit 64 prompt suggestions.

+ Stage Three: Voting
* Once all the prompts have been collected, they will be placed into a Google form to be voted on.
* The voting will be conducted as a knockout tournament with two entries being placed against each other at a time in randomly selected brackets.
* Voting will last for 7 days.

//**Note:** This stage is where it gets fun, you get to see your favourite prompts tragically eliminated or triumphantly moving to the next voting stage. Join the discord to convince people that, no, in fact, Crab World isn&#39;t better than 25th Century Ghost Warfare!//

+ Stage Four: Worldbuilding
* All users are encouraged to discuss what they think the setting or canon should look like.
* The Staff Team will read these discussions and regularly update a sandbox page with parts of the discussion that are popular with users and work with the overall project. This page will serve as a reference for users who weren&#39;t present for every single discussion, as well as the framework for what will become the Canon Hub.

+ Stage Five: Writing
* Now is the time for writing. Bear a few things in mind:
     # This is meant to be a coherent canon, with stories relating to one another in some form, whether it be directly, or through theme and setting.
     # Don&#39;t be afraid to get weird---unique ideas are how things stay interesting. Remember this is a *collaborative* canon, and your story should at the very least fit into the scope and general feel of the canon, even if you choose to go in a fun new direction.
     # That being said, while our aim is to create a rich and varied setting, **There IS No Canon**. This means contradictions are inevitable, and don&#39;t worry about your story lining up perfectly with all of the others.

+ Rewards

A limited-time discord role is available to those who post a positively-rated work within a month of Stage Five. Previously, Last Light writers won the title of [[span class=&#34;last-light&#34;]]Withstander[[/span]], Vitalis writers are aptly named[[span class=&#34;vitalis&#34;]]Vitalis LLC Employee of the Month[[/span]], and TitanClash writers boast the epithet of [[span class=&#34;titanclash&#34;]]Kaiju Pit Crew[[/span]].

Besides that, all you&#39;ve got to play for is honour, glory, and stories.

||Number||Prompt Description|| Author||Furthest Round Reached||
||1||A traveler&#39;s guidebook with essential information to remember when traveling to different locations across the multiverse.||[[*user Plilt]]||5||
||2||A collaboratively assembled (in universe) document comparative religious practices across the multiverse.||[[*user Plilt]]||1||
||3||Pirates from hell and the Greek hell rivers are oceans||[[*user Impperatrix]]||3||
||4||Dinosaurs||[[*user Impperatrix]]||1||
||5||Under the Shelves||The_Spider_Queen||1||
||6||Through the Forest||The_Spider_Queen||2||
||7||The behind the scenes workings of the Library, things like staff meetings. ||[[*user Wesbot]]||1||
||8||The dreams of a dying eldritch god||[[*user Doctor Pann]]||3||
||9||D&amp;D/tabletop game session in the Library. Any author avatar/OC Wanderer is welcome. Shenanigans will happen.||[[*user Seraphannim]]||3||
||10||Exploration log. Dwelling into a post apocaliptic scenario, in a soon-to-die Earth or even other planet. What happened? Zombie outbreak? Extreme weather change? A post When Day Breaks scenario? Is for the explorers to find out.||[[*user Seraphannim]]||1||
||11||A steampunk dystopia||[[*user Din-Bidor]]||1||
||12||Food throughout the multiverse: its preparation and cultural significance||[[*user Din-Bidor]]||3||
||13||Children&#39;s literature. Trying to write something that could appeal to younger audiences first and foremost while still being entertaining for adults would be a very good creative exercise.||[[*user Draven Addams]]||2||
||14||a character wakes up within a forest, the trees of knowledge fester here. He will meet characters that are made from living stories.  Together they will explore the forest and help the character get home.||Averus Muto||1||
||15||The eldritch court, where mighty players play mightier games, and where the border between reality defining concept and person is so thin, it sometimes isn&#39;t there at all.||[[*user Linkinbrick]]||1||
||16||A place where the border between dreams and reality is disappearing, where metaphor bleeds into actuality; not for a single protagonist, but a whole society. What chaos reigns, when many individual perspectives try to assert themselves in reality? What order remains?|| [[*user Linkinbrick]]||4||
||17||Cosmic explorers discover a Library in the ruins of a seeming dead world, and as settlements grow and Books are uncovered, the world slowly resurrects, and all manner of fantastical (and frightening) things pour out.||[[*user Lt Flops]]||2||
||18||if that&#39;s lame then what about... uhh.... crabs. crab world.||[[*user Lt Flops]]||1||
||19||Post fantasy. Like a world where all the cool stuff was in the past and the world is frankly moving on, in the middle of a societal shift, where the monarchies founded by the chosen ones are being dismantled, the wild forests tamed, the great beasts killed and harvested||Gecko||3||
||20||a canon centred around a cell of the Serpent&#39;s Hand that&#39;s been trapped in this place between worlds for years where ink and water bleed together, the sky a sickly yellow - and reality can change at the flip of a dime. Little hope of getting out. Strange beasts and shadowy figures haunt the Ways Between, all Red Masks and shivered robes; it is they who control the rules, and they who trap those that strive to leave. Lots of Orpheus/Persephone vibes to the place, as well as some King in Yellow, Magician&#39;s Nephew undertones. Develop this weird halfway world, and eventually get the remnants of this cell of the Serpent&#39;s Hand cell out of it; would involve following several parallel storylines and figures, loosely connected plotting, lots of eldritch fuckery, etc. etc.||Rota_Fortunae||1||
||21||A canon looking into the Library&#39;s connection with various real-world cultures and myths, exploring a potential alternate origin story (or series of origin stories, each loosely having similarities and differences) to how the Serpent&#39;s Hand found it in the first place (or how the library found them), laden with a bunch of historical exploration, interconnected figures that served important roles only to fade into old dusty archives over time, stories now lost in the ever-shifting shelves forever. Of course, this second concept would have the continuous inherent undertone of contradiction; the goal of it would be to intentionally build a hazy, semi-mythological feel to the origins of this site-centric relationship, always centring it on the theme that it&#39;s not necessarily the accuracy of such recordings of events that matter, more the fact there are stories at all.||Rota_Fortunae||1||
||22||A canon that centers entirely around Planasthai, looking into the lives of its reporters, what they report on, and how their scoops influence Library life.||[[*user CadaverCommander]]||2||
||23||A small New Mexico town in the middle of dusty nowhere is suddenly infiltrated by threats from another world. A single automotive mechanic and his friends are the only ones who witness these events directly, and must band together to figure out how to defend their town from things they can&#39;t begin to understand.||[[*user CadaverCommander]]||1||
||24||a world of ideas discarded from other worlds, things that leaked, stuff that just didnt Fit In elsewhere: the interstitial dumping ground of the multiverse&#39;s narratives that Go Nowhere||[[*user Carolynn Ivy]]||2||
||25||magic university/city but it&#39;s inside a dragon that&#39;s flying around in space||[[*user rumetzen]]||1||
||26||superheroes||[[*user rumetzen]]||1||
||27||The World Tree is burning down.||[[*user Doctor Pann]]||2||
||28||Too many birds were hit by one stone||[[*user Snapdragon133]]||1||
||29||Ancient gods try to find ways to stay relevant and keep worshippers in the space age.||[[*user Gabriel McQueen]]||4||
||30||Every single way closes and refuses to reopen for a 20 thousand years. For one day every year, 2 people from opposite sides can switch places.||[[*user AnActualCrow]]||1||
||31||Fragmented dimensions/realities of a singular, collective universe quickly begin meshing back together after previously being shattered apart||[[*user JakDragonX]]||2||
||32||A universe where the inhabitants think their own bodies into existence||[[*user Wesbot]]||1||
||33||All non-paranormal humans disappear. Everything left makes do||[[*user EleneeFishtruck]]||4||
||34||The stories a river sees over the thousands of years that make up its lifetime.||[[*user GremlinGroup]]||1||
||35||a group of paranormal, juvenile delinquents get ejected into a post-apocalyptic universe who&#39;s environment is experiencing time backwards||[[*user JakDragonX]]||1||
||36||low-ranking workers of the afterlife struggle under the employ of an uncaring Managenent||[[*user MaliceAforethought]]||5||
||37||Lost character hops Ways, trying to find home but ends up deeper in the Library||[[*user ProgressMade]]||1||
||38||Sapient life develops, not on a planet, but on a planet-sized living organism that moves through space with its own intentions.||[[*user Gabriel McQueen]]||2||
||39||The Library seems to be expanding in a manner akin to the Dark Matter expansion of our universe; pretty soon interaction between patrons will be nigh on impossible.||[[*user Piano_WL]]||1||
||40||The amount of active Ways, of any kind or destination, suddenly increases tenfold; likewise, the knocks all become significantly easier to accidentally set off. Cue shenanigans.||[[*user Piano_WL]]||2||
||41||Someone gets lost between “our” reality and the Library. A team of patrons and Library staff must work together to rescue them, and the lost person must hold out in a bizarre, utterly fantastical alien world.||Deleted User||1||
||42||Now it&#39;s just me, and I need to figure out what happened, Where did all the monsters go?||[[*user YellowISlol]]||2||
||43||Hijinks in literally just historically accurate Indonesia between mid60s–late90s, where ideologies were suppressed, corruption were rampant, and inconveniences had a way to just disappear.||[[*user Rigen]]||1||
||44||The sands around the city are shifting; strange things are uncovered, and ancient bonds are broken as lords rush to claim the treasure||[[*user MaliceAforethought]]||3||
||45||Floating towers connected by bridges where books, ink, and words themselves attack||[[*user ProgressMade]]||1||
||46||The Citadel of Black Glass houses the gods, in the hope that the other polises will be left untouched by them.||[[*user Akhlys]]||3||
||47||A world in the delusions of a comatose person.||alexdoesnotexist||1||
||48||Pirates!!! But specifically ghost/zombie pirates! On a phantom ship! Having adventures! Yarr!||[[*user Draven Addams]]||2||
||49||Modern-day tech is, in the post-apocalyptic dark ages, considered magical and kept secret from commoners.||Deleted User||2||
||50||A Broken-Masquerade-like scenario in which magic and rituals become commonplace and natural among civilians and become integrated into human society.||Deleted User||1||
||51||a world divided by houses. Each house is composed by a academic central wich is responsible for a specific kind of magic source. For exemple, a house wich use energy from pain or simple exchanges. on that scenario, you see a lot of groups that benefit from 2 or more houses.||Zéfiro||1||
||52||Humanity finds and (shakily) befriends a civilization living on the other side of the earth&#39;s crust.||Deleted User||2||
||53||And as we stepped off the lunar lander, we watched the Earth explode.||[[*user UncertaintyCrossing]]||2||
||54||We all remember the end of the world, don&#39;t you?||[[*user UncertaintyCrossing]]||1||
||55||magic, intrigue, and wonder in the eastern bloc and its satellite states||[[*user Carolynn Ivy]]||3||
||56||A world that does not have nighttime in any form.||alexdoesnotexist||1||
||57||Some creatures don&#39;t need wings to fly.||[[*user YellowISlol]]||1||
||58||There is an endless city. It stretches towards the horizon, on and on and on. It is a city of cities and it has a source. And the closer you get to the source, the closer you get to the fable - The First City.||[[*user Varaxous]]||6||
||59||Every singularity points in one direction: the end. The stars of the multiverse blink out, one by one, and everything fades to black. But there is an exception. Only one. And all of creation flocks to this final island.||[[*user Varaxous]]||👑||
||60||Earth is soon going to be struck by a mysterious, world-ending cataclysm, and an organization has been founded to explore and monitor parallel universes-- from very similar to FUCKED UP-- to see if they can find a way to stop it.||[[*user Ellie3]]||1||
||61||And yet, the solution to their problem never shows up despite their countless journeys, always just slightly above the horizon||Deleted User||2||
||62||There&#39;s been a conspiracy since time immemorial to open a massive inter-dimensional portal the size of a small country. And judging on the huge hole that just opened up in Colorado, it seems to have worked.||[[*user Fish Salad]]||2||
||63||Medieval warriors, kings, peasants, and priests have appeared after a massive accident at an experimental research facility, and they&#39;re not exactly happy with the state of the modern world... ||[[*user Fish Salad]]||1||
||64||Everyone in this world is the Chosen One to do something||[[*user Snapdragon133]]||4||
