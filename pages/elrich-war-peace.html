King Isaav&#39;s bladder leapt into his throat. &#34;Oh! The juggling act has gone horribly wrong.&#34;

Gripping Isaav&#39;s arm was the hooded Carrier of the Cabbage. &#34;Yes, sire, it, uhm-it would appear that way.&#34;

Both kept watch as the remains of the actor just kept tumbling in different directions down the hill.

&#34;I mean, just look at-oh, and everybody can see. Nobody&#39;s ready to see a fool&#39;s blood spilling. Are they looking, Carrie?&#34;

Turning inside his heavy hood, the Carrier could see commotion rabble-rising among the King&#39;s men. &#34;Yes sire, it appears so.&#34;

&#34;God, it&#39;s just... the opposite of what you want to happen, right? Can&#39;t be good, can it?&#34;

&#34;Sire, although the mystic fruit flies did predict dominant battlefield performance, there are these obfuscating frogs of war which even the most enlightened vegetative states cannot decipher.&#34;

Raising his monocle, King Isaav could see clear across to the opposing force. &#34;Oh, and they&#39;ve all got their tongues out too. Disrespectful, really disrespectful. Carrie, can we really go on like this? His whole head was in two.&#34;

&#34;First off, sire, my compliments on your being quite astute in your observations. May I mention the fact that the opposing jester seems to be doing sword swallows, and flipping us the duckies?&#34;

&#34;Look, Carrie. I can see it. I know.&#34;

&#34;Shall I send an emissary over to seek terms, my lord?&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m not getting my money back for the show. At this point, might as well cut the losses...&#34;
