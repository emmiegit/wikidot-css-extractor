**Special Containment Procedures:** All 101 entities composing SCP-5516 are to be contained within Aquatic Enclosure L-23 at [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-184|Site-184]]]&#39;s Aquatic Anomalies Wing. Aquatic Enclosure L-23 constitutes one 10 x 10 x 1m, aquarium holding ± 90,000L of seawater. SCP-5516 poses a Null-1 containment risk; as such, the use of localized seawater for the containment habitat -- provided Site-184&#39;s seawater decontamination facilities continue to pass bi-monthly inspections[[footnote]] Amd-1: As of 17/03/2007, Site-184&#39;s seawater decontamination facilities are inspected monthly. [[/footnote]] -- and standard Aquatic Enclosure automated cleaning practices are approved. 

SCP-5516 entities are fed via automated food dispersal at 08:00 and 19:00.[[footnote]] Amd-2: As part of my ongoing research into SCP-5516, food dispersal at 08:00 has been suspended. SCP-5516 entities are instead fed via hand dispersal at 09:00, to better conduct behavioural analysis. [[/footnote]] All SCP-5516 entities are assigned designation numbers: SCP-5516-1 - SCP-5516-101. Designation numbers are to be marked on the carapace of SCP-5516 entities using FLaN-Aquatic Paints.[[footnote]] Amd-3: The use of FLaN-Aquatic Paints at Site-184 was discontinued in 1998, due to averse effects on delicate aquatic lifeforms. Current practices utilize Sea-Breeze P.I.T.s (Passive Integrated Transponders) for the designation of SCP-5516 entities. [[/footnote]] Emergent SCP-5516 entities are assigned the designation number of the recently deceased SCP-5516 entity.[[footnote]] Amd-4: Following the events of 05/11/1996, procedures following an increase in total SCP-5516 entities should be codified. I propose the following addition: &#34;Should the net total of SCP-5516 entities increase, emergent SCP-5516 entities are to receive sequential designation numbers.&#34;[[/footnote]] Deceased SCP-5516 entities possess no anomalous threat and are approved for incineration alongside Site-184&#39;s non-anomalous biological waste. 

**Description:** SCP-5516 is the collective designation for 101 SCP-5516 entities. SCP-5516 entities are visually identical to non-anomalous //Homarus Americanus//[[footnote]] The American or Northern Lobster. [[/footnote]] but demonstrate a variety of anomalous behaviours:
* Significantly higher cognitive aptitude and puzzle-solving ability compared to non-anomalous //Homarus Americanus//.
* Communal hunting, and food rationing and distribution practices.[[footnote]] Cmt--1: Recent studies have shown that while SCP-5516 entities distribute food evenly, certain SCP-5516 entities display preferences; when various food sources are introduced, SCP-5516 entities can be seen exchanging their allotted food with other SCP-5516 entities. Of note, no SCP-5516 instance has been seen attempting to steal or otherwise deprive another SCP-5516 entity of food. [[/footnote]] 
* Simultaneous &#39;idle&#39; state: When not hunting or feeding, SCP-5516 entities distribute themselves evenly across their enclosure and demonstrate simultaneous self-grooming behaviour. [[footnote]] Cmt-2: Upon introducing more diverse terrain features to SCP-5516&#39;s enclosure, certain SCP-5516 instances can be seen repeatability positioning themselves adjacent to particular terrain features. Upon repositioning these terrain features within the enclosure, SCP-5516 entities will redistribute themselves to allow individual entities to remain near their preferred terrain features. [[/footnote]]
* Ability to navigate to other SCP-5516 entities: When removed from their enclosure, SCP-5516 entities will return to other SCP-5516 groupings, displaying a 95% success rate while unobstructed.[[footnote]] Amd-5: SCP-5516 entities display distressed behaviour when removed from close proximity to other SCP-5516 entities. This distressed behaviour is reduced if multiple SCP-5516 instances are kept within close proximity to one another, following removal from their Aquatic Enclosure[[/footnote]]
* Collective, non-entity-dependent problem solving: Individual SCP-5516 entities are capable of solving memory puzzles presented to other SCP-5516 entities. SCP-5516 entities have utilized this ability to bypass simplified rotary numeric locks and meet kinetic-based food distribution systems in testing environments. 
* Limited Self-Proliferation: Following the death of an individual SCP-5516 entity, 6-18 hours later, a separate SCP-5516 entity undergoes a molting process that produces two distinct SCP-5516 entities of roughly equal size.  

Due to the aforementioned behaviour, it is theorized that individual SCP-5516 entities are controlled by a singular group-consciousness.[[footnote]] Cmt-3: Due to my ongoing studies into SCP-5516, I believe we have been too hasty to assign a group-consciousness to SCP-5516. Individual entities are seen displaying clear preferences, distinct from collective behaviour. I propose the possibility that SCP-5516 entities possess a two-leveled self-awareness, allowing them to be aware of themselves as both individual entities and a collective consciousness.  [[/footnote]]

**Recovery:** On 04/21/1987, all SCP-5516 entities[[footnote]] Amd-6: Only the initial 100 SCP-5516 entities were recovered on 04/21/1987. [[/footnote]] were recovered by [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#lambda-14 Mobile Task Force Lambda-14] (&#34;One Star Reviewers&#34;) while conducting a raid of &#34;Allan&#39;s Seafood,&#34; formerly located in Liscomb, Nova Scotia, due to a suspected affiliation with [[[ambrose-restaurant-hub|GOI-116: Ambrose Restaurants]]]. 

**Addendum: Experiment Ceta-88C** On 05/11/1996, Dr. [DATA EXPUNGED] oversaw the testing of Oros-Class Amnestic on SCP-5516-17, under R&amp;D initiative: Waning Moon - Ceta. 

At the time of testing, the development of Oros-Class Amnestic was ongoing; the Ethics Committee issued approval for testing on █████████████ invertebrates. Following the events of 05/08/1996, Dr. Oswald Grisdale, alongside Dr. Sylvia Morrison, and Dr. [DATA EXPUNGED], administered Oros-Class Amnestic to SCP-5516-17.

Following testing, SCP-5516-17 entered a catatonic state for 2 hours before resuming typical behaviour. 10 hours after testing, SCP-5516-82 molted, producing two SCP-5516 entities: SCP-5516-82 and SCP-5516-101.[[footnote]] Cmt-4: Although the original SCP-5516-101 and SCP-5516-17 entities have since died, the total quantity of SCP-5516 instances have remained at 101 entities.

[EXTRANEOUS AUDIO REMOVED]

**Dr. Collaert:** Hello, Dr. Werner. I heard you wanted to speak to me?

**Dr. Werner:** Yes, please have a seat. This is about your work with SCP-5516.

**Dr. Collaert:** And the request for access to a higher clearance? Thank you, Sir. I&#39;m trying to revise the entry, but without knowing what happened--

**Dr. Werner:** I&#39;m afraid that won&#39;t be possible.

**Dr. Collaert:** I know I don&#39;t have the official clearance, but in the forty years you&#39;ve had them in custody, the tests from 96&#39; were the only-- 

**Dr. Werner:**  Dr. Collaert, your work on SCP-5516 has been suspended. You&#39;re being transferred; you should receive the details of your new assignment shortly.

**Dr. Collaert:** I, uh, Sir... I don&#39;t understand. I was brought on specifically for my background in-- 

**Dr. Werner:** You&#39;re new here, Dr. Collaert. These sort of rearrangements are not uncommon. Things come up and personnel need to be reassigned as necessary. SCP-5516 isn&#39;t going anywhere, and when you&#39;re back we can see about having you reinstated to your old position. 

**Dr. Collaert:** When I&#39;ll be back? What do you mean. I--

**Dr. Werner:** That will be all, thank you. Please see yourself out.

Jenny, 

They just took me off SCP-5516.  

I&#39;m a little shocked. I got a folder with a new assignment--something to do with anomalous plankton blooms off the coast of Newfoundland. It&#39;s a six-month placement, like, on a boat.

What the fuck? That makes no sense, Sarah. 

You spent four years with your face pressed against the glass of various lobster tanks for that degree and they&#39;re sending you to look at plankton? Christ, I know it&#39;s the Foundation, but I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;ve introduced me to everyone in the lobster behavioural analysis scene in this hemisphere and I don&#39;t exactly think any of them will be taking on the job (plus they&#39;ve got nothing on you anyway).

I&#39;ve got to run, but we&#39;ll chat about this later, okay? Maybe it&#39;s a mix-up?

I&#39;ll do dinner, and don&#39;t worry, no shellfish! 

It&#39;s going to be okay. 

Love you,
- J.

The following is a digitization of Dr. Collaert&#39;s journal entry, dated 25/08/2020. Dr. Collaert willingly surrendered these documents during ECI-11A82N.

&gt; //August, 15^^th^^//
&gt; 
&gt; I walked down to the beach tonight, I&#39;m not sure why. I suppose I don&#39;t need to say goodbye yet - certainly not to the ocean. 
&gt; 
&gt; I didn&#39;t notice at the time, but something weird has been happening the last few months. 
&gt; 
&gt; It&#39;s the lobsters. I&#39;m not sure how to explain it, I suppose I told myself I was just in touch with them. I was spending so much time staring into that tank; why would I question it when I knew a particular lobster was hungry? Sure, I couldn&#39;t wait to get back to work, to them - but why wouldn&#39;t I? I was doing important work, breaking ground in my field, even if no one outside the Foundation would ever read what I was writing. I was doing it for myself, after all. 
&gt; 
&gt; Now I&#39;m not so sure. I stood in the water, took my shoes off and everything, and I swear, I //could feel// the water around me, all of me, like a pressure. I don&#39;t remember undressing, but the next thing I knew I was laying in the water, resting my head where the sand ended. 
&gt; 
&gt; I closed my eyes, and a wave covered me, I let my mouth open and I drank it in. I don&#39;t really know what happened next. The memories, they don&#39;t feel like mine, they don&#39;t fit. I was trapped -surrounded by glass and acrylic, or wood and rope, or both. 
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#39;t know if my brain couldn&#39;t handle it, or if I was drowning, but I was yanked back to myself. I pushed myself up out of the water, coughing the saltwater up. 
&gt; 
&gt; Jenny was worried when I came back, she said I had been gone for a while - longer than I thought. I told her it was because I&#39;d be leaving soon. 
&gt; 
&gt; I hate myself for lying to her. 
[[=]]
[[/=]]
&gt; //August, 22^^nd^^//
&gt;  
&gt; God, I hate packing. Somehow it always takes way longer than it should--as long as you have, it seems. 
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#39;t want to go tomorrow. 
&gt; 
&gt; Jenny&#39;s getting the last few things together. I know she doesn&#39;t want me to go either, but she&#39;s putting on a brave face: &#34;it&#39;s only six months,&#34; &#34;you&#39;ll come back with some sailor tattoos and a pet puffin and we&#39;ll take a drive down to Lunenburg -- get your land-legs back.&#34; I don&#39;t deserve her. 
&gt; 
&gt; I signed up with the Foundation -- we both did -- because it was a chance for us to see more, to know more; I suppose it&#39;s fitting that the first question I asked was the wrong one. 
&gt; 
&gt; I suppose we&#39;ll still both be looking at the same moon, and the same ocean. Her, here on the porch, me
&gt; 
&gt; --on the deck-- 
&gt; 
&gt; --looking out for signs of bioluminescent-- 
&gt; 
&gt; puking over a railing. 
&gt; 
&gt; There&#39;s something shining...


Dr. Collaert&#39;s journal continues on the next page, the writing appears to be scribbled hastily. 

&gt; What just happened?
&gt; 
&gt; Okay, calm down, they covered this stuff in orientation, right? Write it down, yeah?
&gt; 
&gt; Wait, what if it&#39;s memetic? Shit, okay. 
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m going to write it down - I feel like I’m already losing it, like it&#39;s slipping past me. 
&gt; 
&gt; There was a shine? From the moon, or the reflection of the moon on the water, like moonlight on water. Something ivory, moving, but not there - flickering. 
&gt; 
&gt; I remember walking to it, or into it. It was cold, and I could feel them moving. 
&gt; 
&gt; As the water passed my eyes, I opened them, but they weren&#39;t my eyes anymore. I wouldn’t be able to see like that. My head hurts trying to think about it. 
&gt; 
&gt; I was alone this time, I remember being alone. I couldn&#39;t move. I felt the needle slide in, and I saw them: Dr. Werner and two others. Then I was undone. I came apart, I couldn&#39;t think anymore, they had taken that from me, or killed it. They had killed me, but I wasn&#39;t dead, the blood was still pumping, I was still moving. Yet, I was //annihilated//. 
&gt; 
 
&gt; //August, 23^^rd^^//
&gt; 
&gt; If it wasn&#39;t for what I wrote, I never would have known it happened, I&#39;ve already forgotten. The weird part is I don&#39;t even //feel// like I forgot, nothing seems missing. 
&gt; 
&gt; What else am I missing?
&gt; 
&gt; I know things without knowing why I know them. I don&#39;t remember what happened, but I know that the Oros-Class Amnestic kills the consciousness, I know they were panicked as they did it, but not because of the tests; I know they tested it on SCP-5516 when they weren&#39;t supposed to, I know that it made SCP-5516-101, they made SCP-5516-101; there were only 100 to start. 
&gt; 
&gt; They thought they all shared a single mind, one that existed independent of the body, but that must not have been quite right - they weren&#39;t paying attention. I can&#39;t say I&#39;d blame them; I don&#39;t know why they would have looked so close. The test worked, but not in the way they hoped. Whatever Oros-Class is, it didn&#39;t affect the hivemind, but it did affect the lobster, made it forgot itself. Then the hivemind registered one lobster down and popped out another - back to 100 - but the body was still around, so when that died, it popped out another. It found a new normal, and its kept that going all these years. 
&gt; 
&gt; We though it was capped at 100, or 101, but why did we think that - because they are nice, sensical numbers and we like those? I know there are many more SCP-5516 entities out there - shifting in an inky blackness - but how many?
&gt; 
&gt; And I still don&#39;t know why they took the risk -- what were they scared of? &#34;The Ethics Committee issued approval for testing on [space left blank] invertebrates,&#34; non-anomalous - it must be. 
&gt; 
&gt; They must have thought no one would remember, but something did.

++++ ETHICS COMMITTEE INVESTIGATION - CASE NUMBER: //11A82N//
[[/=]]

**__INTERNAL REPORT FORM:__**

**COMPLAINT LEVELED AGAINST:** Dr. Gregory Werner, Head Researcher for Site-184&#39;s Aquatic Anomalies Wing.

**REPORTEE:** Dr. Sarah Collaert, Junior Researcher. 

**DATE:** 23/08/2020

**SITE (IF APPLICABLE):** 184

**NATURE OF COMPLAINT:** Dr. Collaert alleges that during the development of Oros-Class Amnestic -- conducted as part of the Foundation&#39;s Research &amp; Development initiative: Waning Moon - Ceta, Dr. Gregory Wener, along with two accomplices, conducted experimentations on live, anomalous SCP-5516 entities. Additionally, Collaert alleges that Dr. Gregory Werner has been instrumental in the obfuscation of this breach of protocol; in doing so, Dr. Gregory Werner is furthermore accused of misallocating Foundation resources and personnel, falsifying Foundation records, and intentionally disrupting the Foundation&#39;s mandate by preventing accurate record keeping. 

**VALIDITY OF COMPLAINT:** An initial review board, after listening to the testimony of Dr. Sarah Collaert, has found the allegations leveled against Dr. Gregory Werner credible, and opened an official investigation: EIC-11A28N.  

**ETHICS COMMITTEE RESPONSE:** Following the opening of ECI-11A28N, Dr. Gregory Werner has been relieved of duty and placed under house arrest. [[[secrat-testing|Ethics Committee Investigation Task Force]]]: ECITF-Domum-3 (&#34;Human Resources&#34;), is responsible for the gathering of evidence related to ECI-11A28N and has received authority to detain and interrogate the associates of Dr. Gregory Werner: Dr. Oswald Grisdale and Dr. Sylvia Morrison. 

Following the submission of evidence by ECITF-Domum-3 to the Ethics Committee, Dr. Gregory Werner shall be tried by an adjudicative board, as per bylaw EC-10.7.12
