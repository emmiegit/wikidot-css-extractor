[[div style=&#34;color: white&#34;]]
No matter how used to the dive you were, your stomach still sank. I suppose it was the nature of dropping thousands of meters.

The bathymetric data[[footnote]]The measurement of depth of water in oceans, seas, or lakes.[[/footnote]] wasn&#39;t going to collect itself. Ever since [[[document-recovered-from-the-marianas-trench |that document was recovered]]], the Foundation had been keen on the field. A massive expedition had been organized, now under the fully-public guise of //&#34;Project 5 Deeps&#34;//, a multi-arm study that would hopefully find such anomalies before they found us. It was the first and likely the last of its kind: a full-depth descent to all five of the world&#39;s major oceans.

We were stationed in the Indian Ocean, a trench called &#34;Java&#34;. The free-fall lander systems had gone so deep, the cartographic team figured its altimeters had gone unstable. But wouldn&#39;t you know it, the counter stopped suddenly somewhere north of 7 kilometers. Coordinates were 11.129°S/114.942°E.

So here we were, attempting to recreate that plunge, only now with an occupied submersible, //TRITON 36000/2//. It was a cramped vessel, no doubt, and my partner had deleted his need for a shower that day. That, or he was as nervous as I was. Neither of us would admit it. We didn&#39;t need to.

Your brain starts to play tricks on you around the Mesopelagic zone. The twilight of the colors inverts the usual gradation seen in something like the night sky; here it&#39;s dark below, light above. You get the feeling that you are being devoured. It&#39;s enough to unwind first-timers. People see things. Movements, creatures, even people. None of these are real. It&#39;s just the mind playing tricks on itself.

Pretty soon, the only thing we saw was our beacon light. And even then, it could only extend about 15 meters into the darkness. It seemed much less when there was nothing there to see. Particulate matter ascended past us like reverse rain. It reminded me of the old screen savers, and I had a soft moment of nostalgia at... call it... 4,000 meters deep.

The second half of the dive took about four times as long as the first. Not sure how that works out, mathematically. We hit the bottom with a gentle thud, the thrusters augmenting the landing. We opened the antennae and waited. We had to shut off our incoming comms for this part. Thank goodness the light and major functions of the craft could still be kept on.

The Trenches are alien. Creatures found there rival the most imaginative art, and the blackness above you might as well be the infinity of space. Flora dance hypnotically in the currents. The stray oddity floats by, and you have to wonder if it was living or some remnant chunk of decomposing matter, maybe from a whalefall. 

We didn&#39;t see anything too impressive down there. But we did spot a small snake. Looked like your garden variety. We thought it was a strip of plant life at first, but its persistent, horizontal orientation on the ocean floor made it stand out among the taller wafture. It was motionless for a majority of the time, we weren&#39;t sure it wasn&#39;t all passive movement at first. But the small motions — its head meandering this way and that occasionally — were just enough to suggest some volition. It was more than enough entertainment for us while we waited for the data to transmit. 

Our little buddy was within reach of our vessel&#39;s articulating arm, so we decided we had enough juice to expend some energy for some fun. For sanity, maybe. In our boredom, we plucked a small reed from the sand and extended it to rest just before our new companion. But it didn&#39;t move. We figured it was blind. It&#39;s eyes were this pale, faintly-glowing green. Next we booped its little snout with the very tip of the arm, and rotated the leaf towards it. It still didn&#39;t take the bait, not even with it touching its mouth. We tried for a good twenty minutes. Stubborn little fella. Can&#39;t imagine it has a lot to eat, or many opportunities to have something do the work for it. Not sure who was more stubborn though; it or us.

We had decided it might be dead, so left it alone. Just then, another creature came into view. My partner identified it as a decapod, or &#34;a shrimp&#34; as I had to have clarified, which are common bottom-feeders, and also good food for larger creatures there. As it moved into our FOV, we saw its legs dancing lively like some sort of motorized toy. It bumped into our viewing port numerous times, and I had to question just how dumb these animals were. My partner informed me they had rudimentary neurological functioning, nothing more than your typical insect. 

In a flash, the shrimp had been bisected, folded in on itself, its exoskeleton splintering, its head curled past its tail. It was our little snake friend. It had taken notice of the shrimp too. I guess that was more along the lines of its typical diet. We watched the shrimp disappear as it was slowly pushed down into the snake&#39;s gullet, pink musculature burying it from our lamp, small barbs of teeth daring it to try to fight back. 

After it finished, the snake sat there for half a minute. It didn&#39;t move. An odd feeling came over my partner and I — we never looked at each other, but could feel the same thing at the same time. The snake was aware of us. Not the vessel itself, but us, inside it. Something slight wisped from the snake&#39;s nostrils, like cigarette smoke. Finally, it lowered itself underneath our viewport and we could see it swimming away from us, up and to the right. 

Soon, it vanished from sight. We never saw it again. 

We were reprimanded eventually for not reporting this to Command. &#34;Could have been an anomaly&#34;, they said. Some asshole marine biologist back at the Site asked me how stupid I had to be in order to not understand how a perfectly mundane snake in the deepest trenches of the ocean floor was an unusual thing. My partner tried to help, saying it was more like an eel than a snake. That didn&#39;t make a difference to Command or the biologist. They asked me if there was anything unusual about it besides its placement there.

I had the odd thought it had gotten longer in the short time we knew it. My partner agreed. I tried to defend myself by pointing to the vast mysteries of such depths, especially their fauna. Almost //everything// down there would look to be an anomaly. 

Luckily, we escaped severe reprimand. The mission was deemed a success, they couldn&#39;t be too mad. Ultimately we rode back towards the Bay of Bengal, happy to be going home.

I can&#39;t tell you why, but I&#39;ve thought about that little snake since then. I can&#39;t seem to get it out of my mind. The frequency with which it shows up in my thoughts would have me believe it was significant, somehow. But I can&#39;t imagine why. Maybe it //was// anomalous. Or maybe its length was just well-hidden in the sand. 

But in the quiet honesty of solitary moments, I admit the marine biologist was right. I still can&#39;t say what I was thinking at that time. Or what I wasn&#39;t.

It all seems so obvious in retrospect. I guess most things do.
