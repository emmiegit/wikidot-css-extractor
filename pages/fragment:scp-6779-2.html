**Item #:** SCP-6779

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6779&#39;s current location is unknown. 

Once SCP-6779 has been tracked and detained, it is to be contained in a Small Memetic-Humanoid Class Containment Chamber. 

**Description:** SCP-6779 is a small multicolored sock monkey, approximately 0.3 meters in height. SCP-6779 is fully animate and appears to display a moderate form of sentience. Additionally, SCP-6779 possesses a Midlevel Cognition Alteration Effect, compelling all that perceive it to treat it as if it were a very small and cute animal. Affected subjects will pay very close attention to SCP-6779 and every action it performs, fawning over anything the subject considers &#34;cute.&#34; The judgemental abilities of said subjects are drastically lower in the context of SCP-6779, making them perform actions they would not normally do in an attempt to please SCP-6779.

**Incident Nocturnal:** On September 20th, 2011, SCP-6779 was discovered near the entrance to Site-950. It is to be noted that since Site-950 specializes in physical and &#34;straightforward&#34; anomalies and threats, almost none of the staff present had sufficient cognitohazardous inoculation to resist SCP-6779&#39;s effect. As such, multiple staff members had noticed SCP-6779 outside the door to the Site and subsequently succumbed to said effect. Witnesses claim that SCP-6779 was &#34;just a sad little thing that looked so terribly cold.&#34; [[footnote]]It should be noted that it was 31Â°C outside at the time. [[/footnote]] SCP-6779 was brought into the site and given a small quilted blanket and a cup of hot chocolate, which the entity proceeded to pour on its head.

Several minutes after this took place, multiple witnesses who were not currently affected by SCP-6779 heard a loud crash within the Microbial Research and Related Developments Lab on the second floor. Upon entering, it was discovered that the window had been broken, the cause being a brick that was on the floor near the window. Nothing else of importance could be discovered before the investigating researchers got affected by SCP-6779, who was being carried by a large crowd of people that had traveled to the second floor in order to &#34;show everybody how gosh darn adorable this little dude is.&#34;

Site-950&#39;s fascination with SCP-6779 lasted for several hours before Co-Director Helen Gilroy, one of few people stationed at the site with sufficient cognitohazardous inoculation, returned to the site from a small trip. Upon noticing the situation, she notified Mobile Task Force 761-L.A.D.F (&#34;Sheep Wranglers&#34;) to capture SCP-6779 and subdue the affected site personnel. However, when the task force arrived at the site, SCP-6779 had disappeared from the site. Witnesses at the time claimed that &#34;the tiny little guy wanted to play Peek-A-Boo with us and he just vanished when we put our hands down, like the little rascal he is.&#34;

After the incident, it was discovered that multiple small, low value items stored within the site were missing. 

All site personnel have been accounted for after the incident, and a comprehensive memetic and cognitohazardous inoculation project is planned to take place at the site soon.
