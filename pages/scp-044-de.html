**Article:** SCP-044-DE - The Nuclear Virus
**Original:** [http://scp-wiki-de.wikidot.com/scp-044-de SCP-044-DE - Der Kern-Virus]
**Author:** [[*user Robini]]
**Translator:** [[*user Roseaity]]

**Item #:** SCP-044-DE

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-044-DE is to be contained in a virology laboratory within Research Sector-DE-3, which must maintain a constant internal temperature of -20 °C in order to suppress its anomalous properties, such as the proliferation of the object. In the event of complete cooling failure, the sector must be evacuated immediately and a maintenance team clad in VS suits must be dispatched to repair the system. Personnel must wait an additional two (2) days after successful repair before re-entering the sector. Unless approved by a respective Foundation O4 Council member, SCP-044-DE may only be transported to another laboratory for containment if its current laboratory is undergoing maintenance or requires relocation. In the event of SCP-044-DE infection, subjects must be either contained for continued research or immediately incinerated. Should SCP-044-DE breach containment, the sector must be placed under quarantine and all personnel within it is to be promptly cremated.


**Description:** SCP-044-DE is a virion of a previously unidentified genus, measuring approximately 4 nanometers in diameter. SCP-044-DE is capable of asexually reproducing, displaying similar behavior to that of bacterial organisms. It has been observed to possess a single strand of DNA and one strand of RNA, and tests conducted by Dr. ██████ have indicated that it lacks the capacity to mutate. SCP-044-DE can only be transmitted through blood, faeces, saliva, or aerosolized particles, exhibiting fungal properties once infecting a host&#39;s body. Upon gaining access to specialized cells within the host, SCP-044-DE generates a secretion that facilitates its spread throughout the body. All individuals infected with SCP-044-DE are designated as SCP-044-DE-1, while reanimated subjects infected with the virion are designated as SCP-044-DE-2. The latter roam aimlessly and act as an additional vector for the propagation of SCP-044–DE. A list of symptoms associated with infection and their respective time intervals is shown below:

|| **Timeline of symptoms** || **Symptoms** ||
|| Days 1-3 || Severe gastrointestinal discomfort and frequent migraines ||
|| Days 4-5 || Coughing, rhinorrhea, diarrhea ||
|| Day 6 || Emesis ||
|| Days 7-9 || Incessant coughing, bruising from excretory organs ||
|| Days 10-11 || Formation of pus blisters on the skin ||
|| Day 12 || Sudden bursting of pus blisters ||
|| Day 13 || Immunodeficiency, high fever ||
|| Day 14 || Kidney failure ||
|| Days 15-17 || Appendicitis ||
|| Days 18-19 || Liver and spleen failure ||
|| Day 20 || Total organ failure ||
|| Day 21 || Reanimation ||

**Transportation of SCP-044-DE:** During transportation, samples of SCP-044-DE must be securely contained within a 50 cm x 50 cm x 30 cm refrigerated box at a permanent temperature of -20°C. A team of seven personnel must be assigned to the transport, with four responsible for safeguarding the container and three armed with flamethrowers in case of an SCP-044-DE containment breach. The transport must be completed swiftly as the battery life for the refrigeration system is limited to 23 hours. If the battery fails prior to reaching the destination, the transport team must immediately incinerate the box and surrender themselves at Research Sector-DE-1 within 24 hours for examination. In the event that any employee is confirmed to have been infected with SCP-044-DE, they must be promptly terminated through flash incineration.

**Discovery:** Foundation agents stationed in Saarland were initially alerted to the presence of SCP-044-DE following reports of a mass panic in a residential area in Saarbrücken. Following the identification of the source of the panic, Class-C amnestics were administered to all individuals who had been exposed to the incident. In addition, any potential witnesses and instances of SCP-044-DE-1 and SCP-044-DE-2 were terminated. Furthermore, it was reported that multiple persons could be heard shouting the same phrase in public areas within Saarbrücken; the phrase is as follows:

&gt; WE WILL ALL DIE FROM THE NUCLEAR VIRUS SAVE YOURSELVES WHILE YOU STILL CAN!!!!!!

Local residents colloquially referred to SCP-044-DE as the &#34;nuclear virus,&#34; likely due to a misapprehension that the virion was radiological in nature.

**Addenmdum 044-DE-1:**
 **Interview with John Smith:**

&gt; **John Smith:** Let me out of here right now!!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carl:** No. We will not let you go until you have answered all the questions.
&gt; 
&gt; //John Smith begins screaming and insults Dr. Carl several times//
&gt; 
&gt; **John Smith:** Why should I answer your questions. You ██████████?!??!!?!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carl:** Why did you grow this virion?
&gt; 
&gt; //John Smith looks at the samples. He starts laughing and calms down to some extent//
&gt; 
&gt; **John Smith:** Haha. I see. So you guys want to know why I did this? You █████!!! Why not!!! And if you want to ask for a ███████ antidote.... I didn&#39;t synthesize one because I was too lazy!!!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carl:** I rather think you failed to synthesize an antidote, didn&#39;t you?
&gt; 
&gt; **John Smith:** I&#39;m not saying anything about it!!! I was too lazy!!! Not because I have no idea how to synthesize an antidote to this virion!!!! You ███████!!!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carl:** Why did you grow this virion? You, as an award-winning virologist in five different states.
&gt; 
&gt; **John Smith:** Just because I have awards and you pretend to be nice about it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re actually that nice ye ███████!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carl:** What were you trying to achieve with this virion?
&gt; 
&gt; **John Smith:** You want to know what? I&#39;ll tell you!! I hate people!!! I want to see all of them go down when I was in elementary school!!!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Smith:** What have they done wrong which made you hate and want humanity extinct?
&gt; 
&gt; **John Smith:** I say no more!!! I just want to go home now, continue to research my virions you little ██████!!!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carl:** What were your intentions in growing this virion?
&gt; 
&gt; //John Smith assaults Dr. Carl, resulting in his death. Security personnel subsequently terminated John Smith.//

**Addendum 044-DE-2:**
SCP-044-DE Experimentation

Test #1: SCP-044-DE was exposed to alpha radiation.
Result: SCP-044-DE displayed no alteration or mutation as a result of the irradiation.

Test #2: SCP-044-DE was subjected to mutagenic agents.
Result: No alterations in the subject were observed.

Test #3: Testing of SCP-044-DE-2 subjects to ascertain whether they possessed metabolism or nutritional requirements.
Result: The results indicated that the subjects did not demonstrate either of these traits, suggesting that sustenance is not necessary for their continued existence.

**Addendum 044-DE-3:**
Additional information and behaviors for SCP-044-DE-2 subjects:

SCP-044-DE-2 is a reanimated entity derived from the previously deceased SCP-044-DE-1 subject. Upon reanimation, the subject demonstrated a 400% increase in muscular strength compared to pre-reanimation levels.

No organ activity was detected in the following organs:
* Liver
* Spleen
* Both kidneys
* Digestive tract
* Brain

Organ activity was detected in the following organs:
* Heart
* Skin
* Both lungs
* Eyes
* Salivary glands

SCP-044-DE-2 subjects typically exhibit ambulatory behavior and excrete a viscous fluid. The subjects did not demonstrate any discernible brain activity. Observations of SCP-044-DE-2 have revealed that when subjects fall to the ground, they often attempt to stand or run away. They are also more inclined towards groups of people rather than individual persons. Additionally, consumption of food has been noted, although this does not appear to generate any metabolic benefits for the subject. It has been further observed that some SCP-044-DE-2 subjects have attempted vocalization. Finally, it is noteworthy that these entities do not appear to undergo any form of decomposition.

__**Reanimation Process:**__

**Phase #1;** Post-mortem cardiac activity may manifest 24 hours post-mortem. This phenomenon may be accompanied by spontaneous eye-opening in the deceased individual.

**Phase #2;** Following the commencement of the initial stage, two minutes later skin secretions were observed and respiration rates decreased significantly. In addition, salivation was seen to be increased to an abnormal degree.

**Phase #3;** At 8 minutes post-phase two, the subject arises and resumed the standard activities of an SCP-044-DE-2 subject.
