The complete eradication of the &#34;R.a.I.n.B.O.W.&#34; organization due to its special relations to SCP-7799 is ongoing. Different warehouses and apartments that serve as &#34;containment facilities&#34; for the &#34;R.a.I.n.B.O.W.&#34; organization are to be neutralized and condemned to the public, as well as neutralizing the entities that facilitate these areas.

**Item #:** 6340
 
**Object Class:** Safe [[span style=&#34;color:green&#34;]]●[[/span]]
 
**Clearance Level:** 3
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** The assemblage of anomalies known as SCP-6340-A through SCP-6340-C are designated to average Safe-class containment while other anomalous objects under the &#34;R.a.I.n.B.O.W.&#34; umbrella are to be tracked down and salvaged as soon as possible.
 
The &#34;R.a.I.n.B.O.W.&#34; organization&#39;s &#34;website&#34; is to be removed by Foundation web crawlers whenever it may re-emerge on the internet. 
 
**Description:** SCP-6340 is an abbreviation of various anomalies discovered on October 26th of 2022. This raid resulted in the discovery of the &#34;R.a.I.n.B.O.W.&#34; organization and its supposed goals. This organization appears to be a mock of the SCP Foundation&#39;s protocols and mission, all the while its implementation is subpar at most. 
 
However, this association should be viewed with caution as it endeavors to directly rival the Foundation&#39;s comparable objectives and has presented itself in a hostile manner against Foundation forces.
 
&gt; SCP-6340-A appears to be a plastic &#34;ray gun&#34; toy that suffers from an interdimensional disconnect. The object is movable by external forces, however, will begin to freeze in place randomly when moved across any space. When it is in a frozen state, it is incapable of being moved unless left unattended by external forces (excluding gravity) for a short period of time, when forces will be able to act upon it again. It proved to be difficult in containment as agents struggled to move the toy where they desired.

&gt; SCP-6340-B is a copy of a VHS tape released in 2006 that holds an episode of the children&#39;s television show, &#34;Spongebob Squarepants&#34;, specifically the 66th episode &#34;Dunces and Dragons&#34; alongside three other miscellaneous episodes. The front cover art is scratched off by force, and the note &#34;The Clown Came Back&#34; is written in permanent marker.
&gt; 
&gt; Upon inserting the tape into a compatible player, the 66th episode of &#34;Spongebob Squarepants&#34; begins to play dubbed and subbed in Macedonian. Halfway through the episode, the tape switches to a separate view of what is assumed to be a young child holding a video recorder and peering out of their bedroom window.
&gt; 
&gt; An adult male is seen outside of the child&#39;s bedroom window dressed as a &#34;clown&#34; and begins to slowly approach the window. The clown dematerializes before reappearing behind the child as they turn the camera behind them. The footage ends and the cartoon episode resumes where it left off. Viewers of this section of the tape will begin to hallucinate for the next two weeks a &#34;clown&#34; attempting to approach them before disappearing.

&gt; SCP-6340-C is a copy of the national flag of The Gambia. Subjects who don this flag as a &#34;cape&#34; will begin to fly at Mach three towards the direction of The Gambia, before crashing into the Gambian river resulting in the subject&#39;s death. The flag will fly back to its previous location before resting.

Several Foundation field agents reported a dubious warehouse in Los Angeles that SCP-7799-2 instances[[footnote]] SCP-7799-2 instances are humanoid entities donning military uniforms and possess large digital cameras in replacement of their heads. These entities militarize SCP-7799 and are commanded by another humanoid entity, SCP-7799-1.[[/footnote]] had been using to store and &#34;investigate&#34; anomalous items. 
 
After a review of these findings, Mobile Task Force Epsilon-6 (&#34;Village Idiots&#34;) was deployed to eradicate the instances and retrieve any anomalous items into Foundation possession. The following is a minute-by-minute action report of the raid conducted on the warehouse.

[BEGIN LOG] 
 
A large, two-story warehouse located in a secluded section of Los Angeles is in view, as MTF-Epsilon-6 splits up to surround the warehouse in different positions after a several-minute reconnaissance is completed. One squadron in the front of the warehouse, one behind it, and another on the roof. Foundation researchers observe the upcoming event from a safe position. 
 
Davidson leads squadron one, while Sullivan and Reddings are members of the two others. 
 
Davidson and his team crouch-walk near the front entrance where a large explosive breach is hung up. Squadron two at the rear of the building does the same with the exception of squadron three, as it plans to rappel down into the warehouse itself when the two other squadrons clear the area and pin down the instances, as planned. 
 
Davidson gives the signal, and the raid begins.

**0:0:** The breach detonates. 
 
**0:3:** Instances on the other side of the wall are immediately killed by the blast, and the rest within the building take immediate notice. 
 
**0:11:** Squadron two of the warehouse detonates their respective charge eleven seconds late, alerting instances once more. 
 
**0:16:** Squadron one and two open fire on any instances in view from cover. Instances are seen scattering and running while shouting. 
 
**0:18:** The warehouse&#39;s speakers activate alongside the fire alarm.
 
&gt; //&#34;Achtung an alle Genossen! Eindringlingsalarm! Eindringlingsalarm! Rüste deine Waffen sofort in der Waffenkammer aus!&#34;//[[footnote]] Roughly translated from German: &#34;Attention to all comrades! Intruder alert! Intruder alert! Equip your weapons at the armory immediately!&#34; [[/footnote]] 
 
**0:21:** Once all visible instances have been neutralized, both squadrons enter and take cover as multiple instances return armed, ready to trade fire. 
 
**0:35:** All instances are heard to be firing their weapons at the same time, clipping audio. 
 
**0:37:** Both squadrons have difficulty traversing the warehouse due to its disorganized and cluttered state. 
 
**0:38:** Instances retreat to retrieve additional equipment. 
 
**0:45:** The squadron on the rooftop rappels down after being given the all-clear. All three squadrons are now scanning the building together before taking cover again. 

**0:47:** Instances return and engage the squadrons again.
 
**0:56:** An instance is seen running across the building before its ruthlessly shot to death. Its body collides with a nearby shelf, causing all shelves in the area to collapse on various entities and squad members. 
 
**1:02:** Squad members attempt to assist other members in recovering from the falling shelves, and most are covered in miscellaneous rubble and struggling to find cover. Instances suffer the same issues. 
 
**1:18:** One instance accidentally fires at the warehouse&#39;s breaker, causing the building&#39;s lights to momentarily flicker or dim at random times, furthering visual complications. 
 
**1:31:** Reddings fires at a group of instances taking cover behind a giant stack of Diet Pepsi brand sodas, causing the soda to burst and cover the warehouse floor.[[footnote]] This pile of soda most likely exist because SCP-7799-2 instances are known to consume this Diet Pepsi brand soda to gain various health benefits.[[/footnote]] This results in instances and squad members slipping and falling on the ground during combat. MTF-Epsilon-6&#39;s first casualty arises from this. One instance is heard exclaiming: //&#34;Nein! Nein! Unsere Pepsi! Es liegt jetzt auf dem Boden!&#34;//[[footnote]] Roughly translated from German: &#34;No! No! Our Pepsi! It is now on the floor!&#34; [[/footnote]]
 
**1:39:** Behind cover, Sullivan begins a field disassembly on its rifle as it has been completely soaked in Diet Pepsi soda. He asks for covering fire.
 
**1:40:** Some instances can be seen &#34;licking&#34; the ground to quickly drink the spilled Diet Pepsi soda. 
 
**1:45:** As instances fall on top of one another, and squad members slip on the floor, one instance is seen gliding across the floor, attempting to grab anything in its path to stop its fall. It fails to do so, and crashes into a nearby DJ set, causing music to play through the warehouse&#39;s speakers at maximum volume. This proves to be efficacious in the instances&#39; favor, as all squad members at this point are completely disoriented by all the events taking place so far. 
 
**1:52:** All squad members request additional backup. 
 
**2:03:** Davidson becomes moderately separated from his squad, and sends a distress transmission to the rest of his team, which are currently in three rooms across from his. 
 
**2:10:** Three instances round the hallway corner before Davidson dives into the room next to him out of a &#34;fight or flight&#34; response. The instances run past the room. 
 
**2:12:** An SCP-7799-2 instance commander looks down at Davidson from his desk, presumably dazed. Davidson pulls up his rifle and fires at the commander who ducks beneath its desk. Davidson&#39;s weapon fails. 
 
**2:15:** The commander reaches for a pistol under its desk and fires at Davidson, who takes several shots to his body armor before tackling the commander. 
 
**2:29:** The commander and Davidson wrestle each other on the ground. They attempt to choke each other, reach for their weapons on the floor, and knock down various objects around the room.
 
**2:31:** The commander kicks Davidson to the ground as it quickly grabs a metal rod near it. It attempts to strike Davidson, but he dodges. Davidson at this point is desperately attempting to block and evade any swings coming from the commander and its metal rod.  
 
**2:34:** The commander continues swinging its weapon at Davidson who narrowly dodges each strike. Davidson finally finds an opening to use his fist at the commander, pushing him through a weak portion of the wall. The engagement continues in the next room. 
 
**2:36:** Davidson begins to send a barrage of punches at the commander, who is close to incapacitation. 
 
**2:38:** Davidson pulls out his tactical knife and drives it into the commander&#39;s side, successfully incapacitating it. 
 
**2:40:** The commander stumbles back for a moment, before being neutralized by Reddings. Davidson regroups with his squadron. Reddings hands him a Glock for temporary usage. 
 
**2:44:** Sullivan is wounded in his right leg, and has to be dragged to a safer spot for medical assistance. 
 
**2:48:** As backup arrives, one instance accidentally knocks down a shelf carrying &#34;contained&#34; anomalous items placed in plastic containers. The anomalous items fall to the ground and several instances run in front of gunfire to pick them back up. 
 
**2:50:** One instance is seen carrying SCP-6340-A before being neutralized. SCP-6340-A floats in the air from where it was last moved. 
 
**2:54:** Noticeably, another instance runs for cover before running into SCP-6340-A and incapacitating itself. 
 
**2:56:** While Sullivan is being applied first aid, an unarmed instance rushes from behind and throws SCP-6340-C at one of the medics, missing. 
 
**2:58:** Reddings quickly neutralizes the instance and takes SCP-6340-C into possession. Sullivan begins to heal. 
 
**3:00:** A propane tank in the center warehouse detonates after being struck with a round from an unknown source. Presumably by accident. 
 
**3:00:** The propane tank sends a flurry of flames throughout the center warehouse, catching several instances on fire. These ablaze instances begin to run around the building yelling before being neutralized by gunfire. 
 
**3:00:** Meanwhile, Reddings, who had possession of SCP-6340-C, lost the item due to the gust of hot wind from the detonation. SCP-6340-C is blown away and lands on the back of a retreating instance. The instance is instantaneously flown into the air, breaking the ceiling and flying at high speeds towards what is assumed to be the Gambian river. 
 
**3:10:** All instances are eradicated from the building. After a quick final scan of the area, Foundation researchers and agents enter the warehouse to investigate and recover anomalous items. 
Several local police officers are stationed outside the warehouse to stage the event as a &#34;police drug raid&#34; to the public. This cover story would be reported on by several news outlets. 
 
**3:24:** SCP-6340-C returned to the warehouse and rested itself on the floor before being quickly seized. The instance affected by it has not been found.

**After Action Report:** 
 
The professionalism displayed by MTF-Epsilon-6 was brought to question, although were dismissed as the mistakes shown in this log were considered legitimate. 
 
[[/div]]
 
**Findings of Interest:** 
 
Once the warehouse was cleared, several items and areas of interest were found. Such as an instance-owned terminal linking to the &#34;R.a.I.n.B.O.W.&#34; website hosted on an online public platform named &#34;Wikidot&#34; that allowed instances to communicate with one another from different R.a.I.n.B.O.W. &#34;facilities&#34; regarding their findings or discussing classified information. 
 
The following is what was found on the aforementioned terminal. All of which have been roughly translated from German.

&gt; **Warehouse #10 Dossier**
 
&gt; RNBW-173
&gt; 
&gt; **Danger Level:** Irritating 
&gt; 
&gt; **What to do?** Keep it here, and don&#39;t move it. It was a pain in the ass to get here in the first place.
&gt; 
&gt; **What is it?** Seems like a toy ray gun that a drooling infant would play with. But this one seems like it moves whenever it wants.
&gt; 
&gt; **Extra Notes:** I say we destroy it because it pisses me off.
&gt; 
&gt; **Solutions:** Let&#39;s pray that no one ever has to deal with this burden again.
 
&gt; RNBW-096
&gt; 
&gt; **Danger Level:** Be careful
&gt; 
&gt; **What to do?** Make sure it stays here and only here. No one should view it.
&gt; 
&gt; **What is it?** Looks like a VHS tape with a cartoon about some sponge man. Very demonic. Viewing the tape like I just did makes you feel like you are being followed, but I wouldn&#39;t freak out about it too much- WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT WHAT THE FUCK ITS A CLOWN WHAT IS THAT WHAT WHY AM I WRITING STILL FUCK FUCK FUCK-
&gt; 
&gt; **Extra Notes:** 
&gt; 
&gt; **Solutions:** 
 
&gt; RNBW-049 
&gt; 
&gt; **Danger Level:** Don&#39;t touch!
&gt; 
&gt; **What to do?**  Don&#39;t touch this flag. And don&#39;t wear it as a cape!
&gt; 
&gt; **What is it?** Looks to be a flag of some kind. When my friend Djanji wore it as a cape he flew away. I think he&#39;s dead now.
&gt; 
&gt; **Extra Notes:** Witchcraft, most likely. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Solutions:** Poured holy water on it. Seems okay to me now.

**Doctor Edwards&#39; Note** 
 
------
 
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
 
**Note from head researcher Dr. Edwards:** 
 
Although we have been eradicating these so-called &#34;Rainbow&#34; facilities at a quick rate these past few weeks after the retrieval of SCP-6340, this &#34;organization&#34; as it calls itself may be a much bigger operation than we initially thought it to be. 

The entities associated with this organization are unprofessional, as stated in SCP-7799&#39;s file, yes. Might I remind you that these &#34;Rainbow containment facilities&#34; are quite literally named: Warehouse one, two, three, and so on. 
 
At the time of writing, a typical &#34;Rainbow containment facility&#34; was raided and the entities operating it neutralized, to reveal a concerning observation on a recovered terminal. 
 
&gt; //Warehouse #645 Dossier.// 
 
If this number is somehow correct in any way, then I believe that we should be taking this organization a little more seriously, and not from a careless perspective as I see with most personnel regarding this group. 
 
-- Doctor Fred Edwards, head researcher.
