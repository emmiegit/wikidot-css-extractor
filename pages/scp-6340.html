**Item#:** SCP-6340

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6340 is to be kept in a 10 by 10 by 25 foot containment cell. Cell walls are to be lined with three layers of steel plates and the cell door is to be locked at all times. 20 feet up the cell is an observation deck where researchers can view SCP-6340 during tests. At least one foundation member is to be monitoring SCP-6340 through the security cameras at all times. In the event of a breach, SCP-6340 is to be shot down by MTF units using bullets made from pure gold. After the creature is neutralized it is to be put back into its cell.

**Description:** SCP-6340 is an 8 foot tall humanoid entity with 4 arm like appendages pertruding from its back, each ending in an inhuman hand with 7 inch long claws. Appendages each measure about 17 feet long with two elbows. SCP-6340 is brownish orange in color. SCP-6340 does not appear to have eyes SCP-6340 possesses sunken in eyes which can only be seen in the dark in which they will glow white.
SCP-6340 possesses sharp razor like teeth which it seems to be able to retract into its gums at will. Although having human like legs it prefers to use its bottom two appendages to walk. Researchers have compared its movements to that of a spider. SCP-6340 is incredibly friendly towards all creatures it has come in contact with, however it is extremely hostile toward all humans. SCP-6340 has the ability to speak English and has been interviewed 3 times by Dr. ██████. Although being extremely resilient against physical damage, the entity can be harmed using explosives and weapons made from solid gold. SCP-6340 also appears to heal incredibly quickly as any physical damage done to the entity will heal within approximately 10 minutes

**Addendum 1:** SCP-6340 was first discovered in Goa, India, when reports of missing persons and giant &#39;monsters&#39; caught the foundation&#39;s eye. Certain civilians claimed to have been attacked by a &#39;large spider monster&#39; and had just escaped with their lives. Others claimed to have seen a &#39;monster&#39; roaming the beaches at night. MTF Mu-13 were sent to Goa to track down and capture the anomaly. SCP-6340 was found hiding in an abandoned Motel in ████. SCP-6340 attacked Mu-13 and began to slaughter the team. Mu-13 opened fire on the entity, which wasn&#39;t fazed by their gunshots. Mu-13 was only able to contain the object because of recruit ██████ who sacrificed himself by blowing both himself and the entity up with a hand grenade. Although not killed, SCP-6340 was injured enough by the explosion that Mu-13 could secure it and move it to Site ████ for testing.

**Addendum 2:** June 20th, ████: D-2940 was sent into SCP-6340&#39;s cell and instructed to attempt to speak to the entity. D-2940 slowly walked up to the creature, which was standing motionless in the corner of the cell, its appendages wrapped around its body like a cocoon. &#34;H-hello?&#34; D-2940 calls out to the creature. No response. D-2940 is instructed to get closer. D-2940 walks a couple feet forward. &#34;Hello?&#34; Still no response. D-2940 is instructed to get even closer and touch the entity to get its attention. D-2940 refuses. Suddenly, SCP-6340&#39;s eye sockets open and the entity lunges at the class-D, tearing him limb from limb. The entity looks up at the researchers who have been observing from the observation deck. &#34;**No**&#34;, it says.

**Addendum 3:** July 1st, ████: SCP-066 is put into SCP-6340&#39;s cell. SCP-6340 looks down at SCP-066, apparently confused. SCP-6340 picks up SCP-066 and begins to pull on its strings. Hearing the music emitted by SCP-066 apparently pleased SCP-6340, who began to play various songs and tunes on SCP-066&#39;s strings.

**Addendum 4:** July 14th, ████: Two instances of SCP-939 are sent into SCP-6340&#39;s cell. SCP-6340 glares at SCP-939 as if it were studying them. SCP-939 do not seem to notice SCP-6340 in the corner. After 5 minutes, SCP-6340 stand up and towers over the creatures. SCP-939 cower in fear and run to the other side of the cell. SCP-6340 moves over to them, then seemingly kneels down and begins to pet one like a dog. SCP-939 bites SCP-6340 in the arm, which does not faze the entity, who continues to pet the 939. SCP-939 appears to relax, and the other 939 even seems to come closer, apparently hoping to be pet as well. SCP-6340 reaches out and uses it appendages to pet both 939 at once.

**Addendum 5:** July 30th,████: SCP-6340 is exposed to SCP-409. Crystallization process begins on the entity&#39;s right arm. SCP-XXXX screeches out in pain, cursing and wailing at the researchers. SCP-6340 uses its appendages to tear off its own right arm to stop the crystallization. After 10 minutes the entities right arm had grown back. SCP-6340 looks up at the researchers and says, &#34;**And you wonder why I don&#39;t like you**.&#34;

**Addendum 6:** August 3rd, ████: SCP-999 is let loose into SCP-6340&#39;s cell. SCP-6340 looks down at SCP-999. &#34;Cute&#34;, It says. SCP-999 jumps up and down excitedly and begins to hug one of SCP-6340&#39;s appendages. SCP-6340 picks up SCP-999 and hugs the blob. SCP-999 then begins to tickle the entity, which laughs like a lunatic and rolls over on the ground, playing with 999. After 5 hours of playing, SCP-6340 falls asleep and SCP-999 is removed from the cell.

**Addendum 7:** August 19th, ████: 3 class-D personal are sent to move a piano into SCP-6340&#39;s cell. SCP-6340 pounces on one class-D and the other two flee the cell. After dismembering the class-D, the entity turns its attention to the piano. Sitting itself down on the bench it begins to play Beethoven&#39;s &#34;Moonlight Sonata&#34;. Piano is left in the entity&#39;s cell for 2 hours, in which SCP-6340 plays multiple Beethoven songs, Journey&#39;s &#34;Don&#39;t Stop Believin, Billy Joel&#39;s &#34;Piano Man&#34;, and even the popular internet meme &#34;Rush E&#34;.
//&#34;It was indeed very surprising to find that SCP-6340 could actually play the piano. Whats even more extraordinary is that it is very good at it. The playing of Rush E is commonly thought to be impossible, but I guess it makes sense considering SCP-6340 has 22 fingers.&#34;//-Dr. Norman Price

**Addendum 8:** August 30th, ████: SCP-221 is placed down in the middle of SCP-6340&#39;s cell. SCP-6340 is instructed to pick up SCP-221. SCP-6340 reaches out its top left appendage to pick up the tweezers.
SCP-6340 suddenly pulls back its claw, screeching and howling, apparently in pain. When asked what was wrong, SCP-6340 replied, &#34;**IT BURNS**&#34;.

**Addendum 9:** August 30th, ████: A block of pure gold is placed in SCP-6340&#39;s cell. SCP-6340 screams and covers its eyes, weeping. Researchers instruct SCP-6340 to touch the gold block, to which the entity stubbornly refuses.

**Addendum 10:** September 10th, ████: SCP-173 is brought into SCP-6340&#39;s cell. The entity seems to become agitated and begins to slowly back away, always keepings its eyes on 173. In an attempt to avert its gaze, the researchers call out to the entity from above. The entity looks up at the researchers. SCP-173 moves at breakneck speeds and cracks SCP-6340&#39;s neck. SCP-6340 howls in pain and leaps backward and cowers in the corner of the cell, clawing at its face. Guards are ordered to take 173 out of the entity&#39;s cell before it does further damage to SCP-6340. When SCP-173 was removed from the cell researchers began to ask the entity questions. Why did it fear 173 but not every other SCP they showed it? SCP-6340 responds with, &#34;**No**&#34;.

**Addendum 11:** September 20th,████: During an interview with Dr. ██████, SCP-6340 begins to act agitated. SCP-6340 begins to bang on the cell door. SCP-6340 continues despite Dr. ██████&#39;s orders to stop. The entity then uses its appendages to break open the door and escape. SCP-6340 races down the hallways killing anyone in its way. Dr. ██████ sounds the alarm and MTF are sent to contain the entity. Sirens Blair in the facility as SCP-6340 ravages through the halls. The entity then seemingly takes a lvl 4 clearance card from one of its victims, ████, and uses it to release several other SCPs in the facility. These included SCP-049, five instances of SCP-939, SCP-066, SCP-457, and SCP-096. SCP-6340 passes by SCP-173&#39;s cell without releasing it. MTF units attempt to capture the entity, however are unsuccessful as SCP 096 slaughters them all, while SCP-6340 begins to make its way to SCP-682&#39;s containment. Once again, MTF units are sent to recontain the entity, however this time are supplied with ammo made from pure gold and Scrambler goggles. MTF confronts the beast, which immediately begins to slaughter them. Several rounds of fire are sent on SCP-6340, who screeches and screams in pain as the golden bullets pierce straight through its flesh. SCP-6340 collapses onto the ground and wraps itself up in its own appendages, screaming and covering its face. SCP-6340 is placed back into its cell and the breach is secured. The incident left 35 personnel dead and 60 more injured.

Testing on SCP-6340 is strictly forbidden unless under the approval of at least 3 lvl 4 clearance personnel.

&gt; Dr. ██████: &#34;Alright, here we are again 6340. I&#39;m here asking you questions, and you are answering them. Now, I&#39;ve been wondering, why are you so silent about where you came from?&#34;
&gt; SCP-6340: &#34;**Not going back**.&#34;
&gt; Dr. ██████: &#34;We are not going to send you back, we just want to know where you came from.&#34;

&gt; SCP-6340: //&#39;busts open the door and races out into the halls, gutting the guards stationed at its cell&#39;//

{{Dr. ██████ was killed in the containment breach, no further interviews with SCP-6340 have been attempted since}}

,,During the mass containment breach, MTF were instructed to close their eyes when they heard SCP-096 nearby, that way the scrambler goggles could scramble 096&#39;s face before they saw it. Although not perfect, this strategy worked fine enough the contain SCP-096.,,</textarea></pre>
