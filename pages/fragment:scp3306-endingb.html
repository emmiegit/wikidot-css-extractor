&gt; **[Begin Log]**
&gt; 
&gt; **Ashcombe:** I vote for the fairy.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dalton:** Yeah, okay. That&#39;s fine. I saw this one coming, guys. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Long:** No, don&#39;t worry Craig. I&#39;m voting Jeannie.
&gt; 
&gt; **Kirkwood:** Love you too, Shells. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dalton:** Oh. Well, I vote for her, too. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Simmons:** Hold on, slow down. Why is everyone going after her? We haven&#39;t even talked about this yet.
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** Lor, we&#39;ve been talking about this for forty-five years. Sorry, Jeannie, but I think I&#39;m going to vote for you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Long:** Oh! I thought I overheard you telling Dr. Ricks—
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** I lied. Give me some credit, I&#39;m not going to show my hand that easily. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Simmons:** I&#39;m against this. I just want everyone to know that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dalton:** Who are you voting for, then?
&gt; 
&gt; **Simmons:** Forget it. It&#39;s not like it matters now, anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; //Simmons gets up and walks around to the opposite edge of the platform.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** Jesus christ.
&gt; 
&gt; **Long:** There it is, then. Sorry, Jeannie.
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** Wait. Jean, I&#39;m willing to change my vote, but you&#39;ve got to drop the whole I&#39;m-not-telling shtick. If you know who the imposter is, or at least think you know, why not tell us?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dalton:** Not like you got anything left to lose.
&gt; 
&gt; **Kirkwood:** You don&#39;t want to know.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ashcombe:** Fuck you, bitch. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** I really think we do.
&gt; 
&gt; //Kirkwood shrugs.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Kirkwood:** Fine, then. It&#39;s all of us. We&#39;re all part of it. We&#39;re all just pieces in a game that we&#39;ve forgotten we&#39;re even playing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Long:** That&#39;s the most asinine thing I&#39;ve ever heard.
&gt; 
&gt; //Kirkwood shrugs again.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** Where&#39;d you get an idea like that from?
&gt; 
&gt; **Kirkwood:** I didn&#39;t. I&#39;m just the only one who&#39;s remembered. I can&#39;t quite remember how it started, though. I think we—our collective self, that is—were bored. Or maybe we lost a bet. But there it is. Now you know. Keep me nice and shiny, would you?
&gt; 
&gt; **[End Log]**

**Afterword:** As expected, 3306-POI-28 vanished at midnight, an additional horse was added to SCP-3306, and the Illions Event concluded. The five remaining 3306-POI subjects have since suffered a decline in morale, with some questioning their own existence. 

A request for additional counseling staff was approved by Site Director Goode; containment routine will otherwise continue as normal.
