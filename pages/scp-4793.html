**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4793 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell with its furnishings modified to be permanently affixed to the floor and walls.

SCP-4793 must be escorted to the Site-20 Medical wing at 7:00 every morning for Procedure-4793. (SCP-4793&#39;s first daily meal should be given after this procedure takes place.)

SCP-4793 is not permitted contact with the following outside of testing:
* Any materials used in the construction of modern or historical armor or weapons.[[footnote]]Materials such as leather, Kevlar, steel, etc.[[/footnote]]
* Any form of weapons, including items that could conceivably be used as improvised weapons such as the leg of a desk or bed.

A Foundation agent is to remain at the location of SCP-4793-A at all times.

**Description:** SCP-4793 is the entity that emerged from the relief carving on SCP-4793-A. SCP-4793 is a male human that stands 1.92 meters tall. The subject appears to be in their late twenties and has been confirmed to be of Greek descent by genetic testing. However, blood samples showed a previously unknown type of red blood cell within SCP-4793, identified by a series of gold-colored filaments running throughout the cell.[[footnote]]DNA within these cells is only 95% similar to humans and composes approximately 32.3% of the red blood cells present in SCP-4793&#39;s body.[[/footnote]]  

SCP-4793 has demonstrated heightened cellular reproduction within their body. If injured, the fibroblasts present within SCP-4793 will produce collagen at an extremely accelerated rate, usually closing the wound within two minutes. Within the next twenty-four hours, the damaged tissue will completely heal, with the resultant cells being 4% more durable than the originals. However, the cytokine[[footnote]]Known as Transforming Growth Factor Beta.[[/footnote]] that manages the healing process fails to end mitosis. Unless additional damage is received in a different part of the body, the original site will rapidly begin to generate tumorous growths. 

To hinder this, SCP-4793 must have one liter of blood drawn by Site-20 medical staff[[footnote]]Designated //Procedure-4793//[[/footnote]] every twenty-four hours. Because of this, SCP-4793 requires a higher level of nutrient intake to facilitate the production of red blood cells. It should be noted that SCP-4793 does not require a 1:1 ratio, as all biological processes in the subject are 80% more efficient than in nonanomalous humans. Currently, this is being studied to see if it can be replicated and refined for medical applications.

Any material that could reasonably constitute a weapon or a form of armor will undergo a series of near-instant transmutations upon contact with SCP-4793 into something that fits the formal definition of weaponry or armor. No material is gained or lost during this transformation and it has proven incapable of generating complex weapons like firearms or integrating electronics into created armor. SCP-4793 maintains that this effect is completely involuntary. In all instances where this effect was triggered, accidentally or by Foundation interference, SCP-4793 has immediately attempted to remove the object from their person. 

Additionally, they possess advanced combat capabilities, mostly pertaining to physical combat. It is unknown if this is anomalous in nature, or related to SCP-4793&#39;s past.  

SCP-4793-A is a stele located inside of a cave formation within a mountain in southern Greece. Although it displays no major anomalous properties, it has been marked as the origin site of SCP-4793 and has thus been placed under surveillance to prevent interference from any members of the public. Prior to the events of March 1st, 2016, the stele showed a relief carving of a man wearing the traditional armor of a Spartan Hoplite during the Golden Age of Greece (approximately 500 - 300 B.C.E). On the opposite side of the stele is an inscription of an ancient Greek tale previously unknown to the modern historical community.

**Exploration Video Log Transcript**

**Date:** March 1st, 2016

**Exploration Team:** MTF Upsilon-11 (&#34;Avalon&#39;s Wake&#34;)

**Location:** A Mountain Cave in the South of Greece

**Objective:** The termination of a team of mercenaries employed by the Chaos Insurgency and seizure of any anomalous items possessed by said operatives.

**Team Lead:** Captain Holly Shore

**Team Members:** Warrant Officer Robert Jenkins, Lieutenant Commander Ashley Crowley, Warrant Officer Jake McCalloway, Chief Warrant Officer Seigfried &#34;Ace&#34; Zimmerman  
-----

[BEGIN LOG]

//[Camera opens across a mountainous vista. The wearer adjusts the camera fitting slightly. A small team of MTF operatives are gathered outside the mouth of a cave. The corpse of a Chaos Insurgency member is seen leaning against a crate.]// 

**Jenkins:** Dipshit didn&#39;t even see us coming. I guess that&#39;s karma huh, Captain?

**Shore:** Don&#39;t jinx us. Intel says there&#39;s at least five hostiles ahead of us.

**Crowley:** What do you think they&#39;re looking for out here? We swept these mountains after that bit with the Church back in &#39;98.

**Shore:** Who knows. We&#39;re just here to clean it out. //[Turns to face the camera]// Ace, you&#39;re on point for this. Ready to clear out some CI mercs?

**Zimmerman:** It&#39;s what gets me outta bed.

//[The camera abruptly turns and Zimmerman enters the cave. After a few seconds, the camera switches to low light imaging. The path is barely large enough for any of the operatives to pass through. After five minutes of traversal, the passage opens to a massive cave. The ledge that they arrived on rings a pit that descends three stories down. A natural slope leads around the edge of the pit, connecting the ledge to the floor.  A waterfall flows in through the ceiling and large stalagmites dot the ledge. Zimmerman quickly makes his way to one, followed by Shore and Crowley. Jenkins and McCalloway are seen hiding behind one on the opposite side of the opening.]//

**Jenkins:** Holy shit, did you see that?

**McCalloway:** Guess the CIs were onto something.

**Shore:** Report. What did you see? 

**Jenkins:** I.. don&#39;t know what to call it. 

//[Zimmerman leans out from behind his cover. Below lies a stone stele bearing a raised carving of a Greek Soldier wearing the traditional armor of a Spartan Hoplite. Surrounding it is a makeshift camp, with several fluorescent floodlights pointed at the pillar. Several mercenaries are seen milling about.]//

**Shore:** That&#39;s one hell of a... monument? Wait, look at that. Something&#39;s happening. Hold tight.

//[Two Chaos Insurgency mercenaries are seen using pickaxes to unearth more of the stele as music plays nearby on a speaker. One man stops abruptly and lets out a scream. The other man stops digging and walks up to him.]//

**CI-1:** Damn it, Jackson. How did you cut yourself again? Fucking hell, be more careful.

**CI-2:** I&#39;m s-s-sorry Chris. I just got distracted. It&#39;s bleeding an awful lot.

**CI-1:** Then wipe it on something. //[Pause.]// NOT THE PILLAR. Are you fucking insane? We don&#39;t even know what this does. Christ, you&#39;re useless. //[Pause.]// Stand by, team, Jackson just introduced this thing to human blood, so be ready for anything.

**McCalloway:** There goes the element of surprise. Shit.

**Jenkins:** What are your orders, Captain? We&#39;ve got the high ground and they&#39;re just a bunch of civvies playing dress-up. 

**Shore:** Stand by. Those mercs are afraid of that pillar and we don&#39;t want to rush into-

//[Captain Shore is cut short by a flash of light from the statue. Yells of surprise can be heard from the insurgents below. A human wearing the same armor as the soldier depicted on the carving falls to the ground, landing on its knees. It is quickly surrounded by seven insurgents, who all point automatic weapons at it. The presumed leader moves closer to it.]//

**CI-3:** Stand the fuck up. If you make so much as a move towards me or any of my men, we&#39;ll fill you with holes. 

**Unknown Entity:** //[Moves a hand covered with blood to its mouth, tastes it, and coughs for several seconds.]// You... speak... Greek?

**CI-3:** What? We&#39;re using English. Now stand. Up.

**Unknown Entity:** I... don&#39;t know where I am. W-who are you? 

**CI-3:** Welcome to your new family. I promise if you&#39;re good for business, you&#39;ll always have a place here. Otherwise, you&#39;re getting shipped to MC&amp;D. I&#39;m sure some rich fuck would love a little Greek action figure. //[Pause.]// Now I&#39;m sure you need some motivation.

//[CI-3 fires a low caliber sidearm into the back of the Unknown Entity&#39;s exposed leg, to the cheers and laughs of the assembled insurgents. The Entity cries out in pain and collapses as CI-3 turns away.]//

**CI-3:** Pack him up, boys. 

**Unknown Entity:**  //[Pushes itself up and looks at CI-3.]// Please just let me go. I don&#39;t want to fight you. Don&#39;t make me.

**CI-3:** //[Turning back.]// I changed my mind. Rough him up, boys. Hate to have him making a fuss on the ride back.

//[Two mercenaries move into assault the entity.]//

**Unknown Entity:** I&#39;m sorry, Ara- 

//[The Unknown Entity rolls into a combat stance and sweeps the leg of the closest combatant and drives its fist upward into their jaw. It then kicks out at the closest person and a crack is heard as its greaves make contact with their spine.]//

**CI-3:** Jesus fuck! Open fire!

//[Five bullets reflect off the Entity&#39;s armor as it closes the distance between itself and the remainder of the squad, cutting itself out of the line of fire.]//

**Zimmerman:** What the fuck did they just let out?

//[The Unknown Entity begins to work its way through the line of soldiers. Grabbing CI-4 by the throat and the groin, it slams him against the wall. The Kevlar vest on CI-4 slides off and wraps around the chest of the Entity, intermingling with the bronze chest plate.]//

**CI-3:** Can you fucks hit this bitch! 

//[Rolling backward and propelling itself with its hands, it lands a two-footed kick to the solar plexus of CI-5 and launches him backward. Regaining its footing, the Entity grabs CI-2 by the collar of his vest and pulls him into an embrace. CI-3 levels her machine gun to fire and the Entity turns abruptly, taking 13 shots to its exposed back.]//

**CI-2:** S-s-she was gonna shoot me. 

//[Grimacing, the Entity renders CI-2 unconscious with a headbutt. CI-1 charges the Entity with a pickaxe.]//

**CI-1:**  //[Swinging.]// Just die already! 

//[The pickaxe embeds itself in the Entity&#39;s side and staggers it. Looking up at CI-1, it punches him directly in the face. A loud crunch is heard and CI-1 is sent stumbling backward. CI-3 steps back and levels her gun again. The Entity pulls the pickaxe from its side and stands up with some effort.]//

**CI-3:** What... are you?

//[The wound on the Entity&#39;s side has begun to close and the spray of blood slows.]//

**Unknown Entity:** I am... tired of fighting.

//[The Entity throws the pickaxe, which pierces CI-3&#39;s firearm and pins it to the wall of the cave. She lets out a shout and falls to the ground.]//

**CI-3:** //[Crawling backward towards the stele.]// Please. This is a misunderstanding. Do you want money? Power? I can give you both of those. I can give you anything you want. Please don&#39;t-

//[The Entity swiftly brings both its hands together and strikes her temples. The only sounds in the cavern are the moans of wounded personnel and the bullet-ridden speaker that continues to loop &#34;Don&#39;t Fear the Reaper.&#34;]//

**Zimmerman:** Hey Captain. What&#39;s your call? 

**Jenkins:** We can&#39;t take this thing. Look what it did to those guys. They didn&#39;t stand a chance. 

**Shore:** Alright, I&#39;m making the call. Weapons down. Leave them behind. We&#39;re gonna talk this out. 

**McCalloway:** Fuck. That&#39;s insane.

**Crowley:** Do you got a better plan, Jake? 

**Shore:** Shut up and move out. All of you.

//[MTF Upsilon-11 remove their weapons and make their way to the slope leading to the bottom of the pit. As soon as they reach the bottom, the Entity assumes a fighting stance after scooping a knife off the ground. Captain Shore motions for the team to remain behind her.]//

**Shore:** Hey. Hey there. //[Raises her hands to show she&#39;s unarmed.]// We&#39;re not here to hurt you. We&#39;re all unarmed. 

**Unknown Entity:** Who are y-you? Where a-am I? 

**Shore:** We&#39;re the Foundation. We keep people safe. //[Moving closer.]// You&#39;re under a mountain in Greece. //[Pause.]// Are... you crying? 

**Unknown Entity:** I d-didn&#39;t.  Want to...Do t-this. I-I-

**Shore:** Hey, it&#39;s okay. //[Turning over her shoulder.]// Crowley. Call for extraction. We&#39;ve got something. 
 
**Crowley:** Already on its way.

**Shore:** What&#39;s your name?

**Unknown Entity:** A-Androcles. 

**Shore:** Androcles, we&#39;re gonna take you someplace safe. We&#39;ll get everything else sorted out then. 

**McCalloway:** Hargraves is gonna love this.

[END LOG]

**Mission Report:** The Unknown Entity, later reclassified as SCP-4793, was transported back to Site-20. Analysis of the cave and stele are available in Research Log 05. Of the eight Chaos Insurgency targets at this location, one was terminated by MTF Upsilon-11 and seven were incapacitated by SCP-4793. All surviving Insurgents were stabilized and transported to [REDACTED].

[[&lt;]]
&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-4793
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Doctor Eleanor Fitz-Patrick
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Initial Interview with SCP-4793 after recovery.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Hello, my name is Doctor Eleanor Fitz-Patrick and I will be conducting this interview with SCP-4793. Today is March 28th, 2016 and it is currently //[Pause.]// 11 am.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** Hello. //[Leans in close to the microphone on the desk.]// Do I uh, have to be this close for it to hear me? The people I came here with had theirs really close to their faces.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Oh no. It&#39;ll pick up your voice just fine. Just sit back and relax, SCP-4793.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** Who&#39;s that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** It&#39;s just the number we&#39;ve assigned you, just to make sure all the paperwork ends up in the right place.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** //[Visibly Confused.]// Okay!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** I&#39;ve got a couple of questions for you. Little things to get out of the way.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** I&#39;ll answer to the best of my abilities. So you know, I don&#39;t know much about where... or when I am.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Well, that actually leads to my first question. How did you learn to speak English?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** English? We&#39;re speaking Greek. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** So, everything I say, you hear in Greek?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** Yes. It&#39;s all Greek to me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** I&#39;ll make a note of that. Thank you. Now. How did you end up within that stele?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t remember much before you guys showed up. Flashes of things, emotions, tiny details. Like the rough sketch of a person. But nothing- //[Grabs edges of the desk and squeezes.]// solid. Does that make sense?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** It does. Traumatic events can often seal away memories. While I&#39;ve never had anyone like you as a patient, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s permanent. //[Pause.]// You spent a long time under that mountain, didn&#39;t you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** I think. Everything is so... different now. I mean, how could I even learn about everything I&#39;ve missed? Metal birds. Horseless chariots. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Well, if you&#39;re well behaved, we&#39;d be more than happy to provide you with books and other media. But, as I said. You&#39;ll have to follow the rules.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** Is this an exception? Or do you do this for everybody you dig out from under mountains?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** We try to provide certain amenities for sapient anomalies. Ethical treatment. If only everyone we brought here had your sense of humor. //[Pauses.]// I saw the tape of your recovery. And after that, I&#39;m having issues connecting this humor with the man I saw in the video. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** Oh... You saw that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** I did. You showed incredible restraint. Taking fourteen shots across your body and a pickaxe to the abdomen and you incapacitated all of them with non-lethal attacks. Why? Why would you do that to people who only wanted to hurt you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** I don&#39;t want to fight. I know I used to. And I know I was good at it. But that&#39;s not who I am anymore. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Anymore?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** I don&#39;t know if I can explain it. You remember what I said? &#34;A rough sketch of a person?&#34; I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s accurate. It was like I saw a sprawling city, but only for a few seconds.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** And remembering everything about who you used to be would be like asking you to draw this city?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** Exactly. As soon as I woke up, I got that flash and I just... //[SCP-4793 is silent for almost a minute.]// I knew I didn&#39;t want to be him. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** But, you are &#34;him&#34;.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** I know I was him, but everything that made me him is gone. Like a hearth where the fire&#39;s gone out, //[Pause.]// but maybe in a good way.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** And based on this flash, who was &#34;he&#34;?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** I think he was somebody who would have killed everyone in that room if he needed to.
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-4793 is silent for over a minute.]// 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** Do you have any other questions?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Not right now, but we’ll talk again soon, okay?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** //[Smiling weakly.]// I look forward to it.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** SCP-4793 was provided with several books on history and the modern era due to its compliance with all instructions prior to this point. As of March 29th, 2016, there is no update on the transcript on SCP-4793-A.

&gt; **Date:** 7/4/2016
&gt; **Message:** 
&gt; 
&gt; Dear Doctor Fitz-Patrick,
&gt; 
&gt; I recently came across the report from the Greece mission, mislabeled and sitting at the bottom of my inbox. If I didn&#39;t know any better, I would think you were hiding things from me again. We&#39;ve argued at length about the ethics of using anomalies for offensive purposes, but at the end of the day, I&#39;m still the Site Director. I&#39;ve scheduled testing on SCP-4793&#39;s combat skills for April 15th and you are more than welcome to attend. However, if I find out you&#39;ve attempted to deceive me in regards to any anomalies contained at Site-20, I will terminate your position. This is your only warning.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards, 
&gt; 
&gt; Director Jack Hargraves

&gt; **Message:** 
&gt; 
&gt; Director,
&gt; 
&gt; While I may not have all the knowledge that a Site Director might, I can not begin to stress how bad of an idea I believe this is. While SCP-4793 was able to perform as they did in the footage, this does __not__ mean we will be able to replicate it here or anywhere else. It is my professional opinion that exposing SCP-4793 to a simulated combat situation will be detrimental to their mental health. 
&gt; 
&gt; I know you&#39;re set on it, but this mission you&#39;re on? Trying to remake Omega-7? Adding somebody to Alpha-9? It&#39;s like catching lightning in a bottle. Perhaps we should let old ghosts lie and old dreams die.
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt; Dr. E. Fitz-Patrick

**Testing Video Log Transcript**

**Date:** April 15th, 2016

**Observation Team:** Site Director Jack Hargraves, Project Lead Eleanor Fitz-Patrick

**Subject:** SCP-4793

**Objective:** Determine SCP-4793&#39;s combat capabilities in a controlled environment. 
The tests will include: 
* Unarmed melee combat
* Melee weapons


Safety measures include the presence of MTF Upsilon-11 (&#34;Avalon&#39;s Wake&#34;), as well as several remotely activated explosives attached to SCP-4793&#39;s neck and wrists. Observers will be separated from the subject in an attached room.

[BEGIN LOG]

//[Suveriallence footage from a camera within Site-20&#39;s indoor firing range. A door opens and Captain Holly Shore enters with SCP-4793, who is wearing explosive restraints.]//

**Shore:** Alright Andr-, SCP-4793, these things on your wrists? If you step out of line or present a danger, they&#39;re gonna go off. Do you understand?

**SCP-4793:** Yeah, but... isn&#39;t this just more physical tests? Like before?

//[The glass between the range and the observation room is illuminated from behind. Dr. Hargraves and Dr. Fitz-Patrick can be seen.]//

**Director Hargraves:** //[Over Intercom]// Ah! Here&#39;s the man of the hour. SCP-4793, Mr. Androcles themself. Do you mind if I call you Androcles?

**Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Sir, that&#39;s against protocol.

**Director Hargraves:** Eleanor, I am the protocol in Site-20. 

**SCP-4793:** I&#39;d... like that. It&#39;s been a little while.

**Director Hargraves:** //[Over Intercom]// That&#39;s the spirit. Now we&#39;ve got a couple of tests we&#39;re gonna run through today. I was just recently made aware of your, how would I say, peculiar abilities. I&#39;d like to see what you&#39;re capable of. 

**SCP-4793:** Like more running? Or lifting? 

**Director Hargraves:** Oh no. //[Laughing.]// No, we&#39;re gonna be testing your combat abilities. Look at the table on your left. You&#39;ll find a padded baton. Pick it up.

**SCP-4793:** Please, I don&#39;t want to fight. 

**Director Hargraves:** //[Over Intercom.]// You don&#39;t get a choice here. Pick up the baton, Androcles. Holly has volunteered to be your sparring partner. I hope you&#39;ll find her skills... challenging.

//[Captain Shore picks up the baton and places it in SCP-4793&#39;s hand.]//

**Shore:** //[Whispered.]// There&#39;s no way around this. Just give him a show.

//[Captain Shore pulls out her baton and steps back several meters.]//

**Shore:** Bring it on. Afraid of dancing with a girl? Afraid I&#39;ll hurt you?

**SCP-4793:** Please. I don&#39;t want to do this. 

**Director Hargraves:** //[Over Intercom.]// SCP-4793, if I have to tell you again, there will be consequences. I know that Dr. Fitz-Patrick got some books for you. Don&#39;t you want to keep those?

//[SCP-4793 grimaces, and puts their arms into a fighting position.]//

**Director Hargraves:** //[Over Intercom.]// Perfect. Begin.

//[Captain Shore and SCP-4793 begin to circle each other. Captain Shore lashes out with her baton in an attempt to test their defenses. SCP-4793 weakly deflects the blow and retorts with a slow attack on her left flank.]//

**Dr. Hargraves:** You&#39;re not even trying, are you? 

//[SCP-4793 thrusts towards Captain Shore&#39;s chest. Circling their guard, Shore breaks their grip and disarms them.]//

**Director Hargraves:** //[Over Intercom]// For fuck&#39;s sake. You aren&#39;t gonna make a fool out of me, SCP-4793. Put a little effort in or I will detonate those bracelets of yours. I know you probably won&#39;t mind too much, but Miss Shore is very much in harm&#39;s way.

//[Captain Shore&#39;s face shows visible worry.]//

**Shore:** Look, if you don&#39;t try a little, I&#39;m gonna end up with five doctors picking metal out of my chest. Don&#39;t fuck this up, okay?

**SCP-4793:** What if I hurt you? I don&#39;t want-

**Shore:** This isn&#39;t about what you want anymore. If you don&#39;t fight, I&#39;m gonna get hurt worse. So think about somebody other than yourself and pick up your baton.

//[Captain Shore lunges towards SCP-4793, who rolls out of the way and retrieves their baton. Shore strikes at their chest, which is deflected towards the ground. SCP-4793 responds with a flurry of blows across Shore&#39;s right side.]//

**Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** You aren&#39;t actually gonna put Holly in danger, right?

**Director Hargraves:** Of course not. But they don&#39;t know that. They need motivation.

//[Ten minutes pass. Both participants are sweating and Captain Shore is breathing heavily. No definitive blow has been struck. SCP-4793 swings at Shore, locking their batons together.]//

**SCP-4793:** You&#39;re good. Who was your master?

**Shore:** //[Grunts with exertion.]// I&#39;ve had a couple. Did a lot of martial arts and //[Disengages and swings at SCP-4793&#39;s head.]// fencing before joining the military. 

**SCP-4793:** //[Relocking batons and pressing Captain Shore against the wall.]// You&#39;re a better fighter than I thought.

**Shore:** You&#39;re underestimating me.

//[Captain Shore slides her left foot behind SCP-4793 and grabs their left shoulder. Twisting her body, she slams them into the ground.]//  

**SCP-4793:** //[Blinking.]// I... You&#39;re right. 

**Director Hargraves:** //[Over Intercom.]// Congratulations Androcles. You&#39;re the first person I&#39;ve ever seen put Holly on her backfoot, let alone against the wall. That&#39;s enough for the day. But we&#39;ve got a lot of work to do...

[END LOG]

**Summary:** SCP-4793 was able to perform exceedingly well against Captain Holly Shore. While initially requiring motivation, SCP-4793 became engaged in the exercise when presented with a threat to Captain Shore&#39;s life. Director Jack Hargraves has assigned Captain Shore to work with SCP-4793 on a weekly basis to establish a connection that can be utilized if needed.

&gt; 
&gt; Dear Doctor Fitz-Patrick and Captain Shore,
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#39;t know what to say, other than your work has been very disappointing. You&#39;ve had over a year to produce results. We are not a hotel, and you are certainly not here to pamper and play with SCP-4793. This is a weapons program. We are attempting to give humanity the tools it requires to keep the flame alive. Perhaps we need a new sense of direction. You may continue your work. But do not expect me to sit idly by while you squander resources. I will be watching you. A new project is starting soon, but until then, expect me to push SCP-4793 harder than ever.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards, 
&gt; 
&gt; Director Jack Hargraves

[[&lt;]]
&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-4793
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Doctor Eleanor Fitz-Patrick
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Weekly interview with SCP-4793
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Doctor Eleanor Fitz-Patrick, conducting the weekly interview with SCP-4793. How are you feeling today?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** Good, Dr. Fitz-Patrick. It&#39;s finally starting to feel like home. Curled up with my books and these movies, I&#39;m starting to feel like a philosopher. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Oh, what I wouldn&#39;t give to just curl up all day with a book for once.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** I&#39;d offer to trade with you, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;d like the daily trips to the medical wing, or sparring with Hol- I mean, Captain Shore.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Oh? How&#39;s that going? Any changes?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** I trust Captain Shore. She&#39;s not gonna hurt me and I won&#39;t hurt her. But Dr. Hargraves has started switching things around. He keeps... trying to push me past where I&#39;m comfortable. And if I mess up, he gets angry and threatens Captain Shore.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** //[Places right hand on cheek.]// God, what is he trying to do now?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** Well, he’ll  add somebody new or change something, like a new weapon and I’ll freeze up. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Freeze up? Like a nervous reaction? Does this change make you anxious or scared?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** No. I&#39;m not scared. I just feel this rush. Almost like an instinct and it scares me. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** I don&#39;t understand.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** So you know- What is it called? I just read about it. Your brain makes it... I think something about life or death-
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Cortisal? Adrenaline?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** Yes! Adrenaline. So you know that rush? It just feels dangerous. Like if I let it run its course, I might hurt somebody. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Are you sure it&#39;s not just a rush of adrenaline?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** What else would it be?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Perhaps it&#39;s your memories. I know we haven&#39;t made much progress with those but- 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** If that&#39;s the case, I don&#39;t want them.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** You don&#39;t want to remember? Don&#39;t you want to know more about who you were?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** Is it worth it? I mean, right now all I know about who I was, I learned just as I woke up. And I didn&#39;t like it. If the only time I can feel them is when I&#39;m fighting, perhaps the me I was isn&#39;t a good person. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** I understand, but-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** I&#39;m sorry, but I like this version of me. The me that reads books and watches television. The me that tells jokes to you. I wouldn&#39;t want to be anyone else, even if that&#39;s the &#34;real&#34; me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** And nobody can fault you for that. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** I&#39;m sorry. Could we talk about this later? I&#39;m too... overwhelmed by it? Let me give it some distance and we can talk about it later.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** That will probably be good. I&#39;ll do some reading and you can collect your thoughts. Now, what have you been reading?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** Well, I&#39;ve been reading a textbook on World History. Again. I could probably teach the class by now. Is it possible to get any fiction? Something light-hearted.  
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Oh I can think of a whole host of books. And my son&#39;s been reading something called &#34;Jojo&#39;s.&#34; I&#39;ll run them by censors.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** Thank you so much. 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** SCP-4793 displayed reluctance to attempts to restore their memories. Following this interview, SCP-4793 was provided with twelve new books.

&gt; Dear Doctor Fitz-Patrick,
&gt; 
&gt; The levels you go to subvert my expectations are truly astounding. I&#39;ve seen virtually no progress with SCP-4793 since our first meeting with him. But for your own good, Project-X06 is taking up more of my time as it gets closer to completion. Good thing I could multitask my weapons programs, given how poorly SCP-4793 has turned out. 
&gt; 
&gt; But by all means, keep me informed.

&gt; **Date:** 22/8/17
&gt; **Message:** 
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m sorry this isn&#39;t more clear. I was only able to transcribe maybe a third of it and I&#39;m not even sure it&#39;s written text. I could have sworn I saw sentences change when I looked away but my photographs don&#39;t lie. There are some parts I put together through context clues, but a lot of this is something older than Greek. Maybe anomalous itself so I&#39;m forwarding this to the AnomaLinguistics Department at Site-37.
&gt; 
&gt; //Gather around me [Children], I will tell you the story of sweet Androcles. Fierce as a pride of lions and as cunning as a pack of wolves, he lived for nothing but battle. He was beloved by his countrymen and feared by his enemies, so much so that Ares Himself strode down from Olympus to challenge him to single combat. For ten days they fought a terrible [Duel], their blades cutting earth into islands and the sparks turning mountains into forges for Hephaestus. Impressed, he granted Androcles a boon: So long as he fought, he would never know defeat or age and by mixing his [Ichor] with Androcles&#39; blood, Ares declared him kin to the Gods themselves.//

**Subject:** SCP-4793

**Objective:** Continue to explore SCP-4793&#39;s martial abilities.

[BEGIN LOG]

//[Video feed shows SCP-4793 and Captain Holly Shore wrapping their hands with tape and checking the padding on their batons.]//

**SCP-4793:** Ooh, Holly, you missed a finger. //[SCP-4793 taps Captain Shore&#39;s index finger. Captain Shore recoils slightly.]//

**SCP-4793:** I&#39;m sorry. I shouldn&#39;t have-

**Shore:** You&#39;ve never called me Holly before. Usually, it&#39;s Captain Shore or just Captain. Why the change?

**SCP-4793:** It&#39;s just... You and Dr. Fitz-Patrick? You&#39;re probably the closest thing I have to friends. I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;ve overstepped.

**Shore:** I really don&#39;t care. I mean, I&#39;d call you Androcles, but that&#39;s too much of a mouthful. //[Smiling.]// Does Andy work?

**SCP-4793:** Will Dr. Hargraves care? 

**Shore:** He&#39;s too busy with other projects to watch every log, unless I tell him to. Now are we gonna just talk or are we gonna dance?

//[Captain Shore and SCP-4793 begin to move around a circle in the middle of the floor.]//

**SCP-4793:** What do you mean by &#34;projects?&#34; //[SCP-4793 lunges at Captain Shore with an upper left feint into a strike to her left leg.]//

**Shore:** //[Sidestepping the blow and retorting with a jab.]// Hargraves&#39; been trying to &#34;weaponize&#34; scips. Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s for brownie points or for thrills, but everything and everyone that comes here gets tested. //[Deflects a blow and kicks out with her left leg.]//

**SCP-4793:** //[Dances backwards.]// But why weaponize? Isn&#39;t being locked up better? 

**Shore:** If you saw some of the stuff out there, a magic soldier is a pretty good idea. //[Paces around SCP-4793.]// Do the Greeks have an apocalypse? A &#34;Ragnarok&#34;?

**SCP-4793:** Not really. But I did read about the Christian Apocalypse last night. The Rapture.

//[SCP-4793 swings their leg and pivots abruptly.]//

**Shore:** Stuff like that? The Foundation&#39;s gotta stop that every day. That&#39;s why the O5s want to even the odds with scips they can control. //[Closes the distances and launches a series of attacks on SCP-4793.]//

**SCP-4793:** Why haven&#39;t they done that? //[Counters Captain Shore&#39;s blows.]//

**Shore:** //[Breathing heavily.]// They did. An MTF called Omega-7. Had a scip that was more animal than man.

**SCP-4793:** //[Going on the offensive.]// What happened? 

**Shore:** //[Locking batons.]// They fucked up. He killed his team... You remind me of him sometimes. 

**SCP-4793:** How? Wait... you knew him?

**Shore:** I fought beside him. If you could call it that. I was gone before he snapped.

**SCP-4793:** You didn&#39;t answer me, Holly. //[Breaks the lock and stands still.]//
 

**Shore:** //[Leaning back and breathing heavily.]// You&#39;re both perfect soldiers, Andy. Capable of shit the rest of us can&#39;t even dream of. But you have morals. 076 was less human and more a force of fucking nature.  

**SCP-4793:** What makes you think that?

**Shore:** You&#39;ve been toying with me this whole practice. You could have ended the fight on the first move but you didn&#39;t. You&#39;re not trying.

**SCP-4793:** Doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m- 

**Shore:** Don&#39;t challenge me on this. I know it when I see it. You&#39;re fighting because it means you get time out of your room. And you get to see me.

//[Captain Shore swings at SCP-4793. SCP-4793 dodges without looking.]//

**SCP-4793:** Shouldn&#39;t you be more scared? With the things you&#39;ve seen?

**Shore:** No. I trust you. 

//[SCP-4793 launches into a pattern of increasingly faster attacks. Captain Shore attempts to avoid them and ends up against a wall, barely able to counter the last blow by locking it at the hilt. SCP-4793 presses their advantage, leaning into Captain Shore until their faces are centimeters apart.]// 

**Shore:** You&#39;re a good man, Androcles. 

//[SCP-4793&#39;s arms go limp, causing Captain Shore to fall forward and land on the ground.]// 

**SCP-4793:** Arabel...

**Shore:** //[Getting up.]// Hey, Andy? Are you okay? Androcles? 

[END LOG]

**Summary:** After several minutes, SCP-4793 returned to a stable state of consciousness. Examination by a medical team yielded no information and an interview with Dr. Fitz-Patrick was arranged.

&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-4793
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Doctor Eleanor Fitz-Patrick
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Interview conducted following an incident during combat training.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** What happened out there, SCP-4793? Are you okay?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** Yeah, I think so. I... remembered something.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** What was it? Do you remember your past now?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** No. it was just one person. Her name was Arabel. She... was my wife, I think.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Is that everything? What triggered this?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** Please don&#39;t rush me. I&#39;m... still processing this all myself.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** I&#39;m sorry, //[Pauses.]// I&#39;m just worried about you. Holly&#39;s worried too. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** Really?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Yes. You just froze and nobody could get you to move or react. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** Thank you for your concern. I&#39;m sorry.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** It&#39;s not your fault. But I am here to discuss what happened with you when you&#39;re ready.
&gt; 
&gt;  //[Several minutes pass.]// 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** There was a woman. Her name was Arabel and I loved her. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** From your past?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** Yes. We fought together.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Like marital squabbles?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** No. Like battle. That&#39;s where we met.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** I met my husband at a bar, but your first date sounds much more interesting.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** //[Small laugh.]// I guess. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Well, what triggered this? Was it sparring?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** I think it was what Captain Shore said. &#34;You&#39;re a good man, Androcles.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Just that phrase?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** No, it was more complex than that. The way we were standing or how she said it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** How do you feel about Holly Shore?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m //supposed// to feel. About anything.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Supposed to feel?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** Hargraves wants me to be a weapon for him. I get that now. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** And how are you processing that? What part of this is hard for you to understand?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** My wife&#39;s dead, any friends I had are dead, the world I knew is gone. How do you even process this? I&#39;ve poured my time into reading about everything that&#39;s happened and it&#39;s just... overwhelming.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Could you expand on that a little?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** It was simple back then. If you fought, you knew what you were fighting for. Your king, to protect your family, to protect your country. And now? I just read that the President of the United States overthrew the government of another country at the request of a fruit company. Can you imagine that? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Did... that actually happen?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** Guatemala and Eisenhower. I followed everything until I reached World War II. //[Pause.]// How can I understand what I would be fighting for? How do I even try to understand what matters in this new world?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** So... if I&#39;m following, you&#39;re afraid to fight because you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re fighting for? And this is what&#39;s making it hard for you to work with Hargraves?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4793:** I&#39;m trying to explain why I&#39;m complacent. In a roundabout way, I guess. I don&#39;t understand what&#39;s out there, or what I&#39;d do out there, so living like this? It&#39;s far better.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** I&#39;m starting to pick up on the analogy. And we&#39;ve got a lot more digging to do on this, so we&#39;ll pick this up next time we talk, okay?
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Due to SCP-4793&#39;s confusion, they were placed under close medical care for the following week.

&gt; //As he came to bear on the world, he met his match in a woman from a distant land. With skin of whitest sand, covered in blues from the ocean, she blazed in his eyes like Helios&#39; chariot. Together, the mountains bowed before them. But even as Eros&#39; arrow brought them together, an arrow split them apart, for Jealous Ares saw his favored love something other than Himself. With his guiding star gone, Androcles tore the bones of the Earth itself. With his rage and lust for battle extinguished, he turned the battlefield into Twin mountains. With his purpose lost, he entombed them forevermore.//

&gt; Dear Doctor Fitz-Patrick,
&gt; 
&gt; Success! I have fostered the creation of a new lifeform. It&#39;s a bit rugged right now but with the right influences, I should have a viable candidate for Alpha-9 soon. Right now, all it needs is a mother. As such, I&#39;m pulling you off the SCP-4793 project and moving you to X06. Effective Immediately. 
&gt; 
&gt; The staff already assigned to the project will brief you more on this but don&#39;t touch anything. We still don&#39;t know the extent of its abilities. 
&gt; 
&gt; Merry Christmas,
&gt;

**Combat Log Transcript**

**Date:** 28/12/2018

**Subject:** SCP-4793

**Objective:** Continue to explore SCP-4793&#39;s martial abilities.

-----

[BEGIN LOG] 

//[The door to Site-20&#39;s indoor firing range opens. Captain Holly Shore enters. SCP-4793 is already inside, leaning against the divider between shooting stalls.]//

**Shore:** There&#39;s my favorite guy! It&#39;s been too long.

**SCP-4793:** //[Jolting up.]// Oh! Hey Holly. Sorry, I was lost in my thoughts.

**Shore:** You&#39;ve got a few more seconds to think. Then we&#39;ll start.

**SCP-4793:** And what are we doing today? More sparring?

**Shore:** Not today. You probably won&#39;t like this, but we&#39;re gonna take another look at firearms.

//[Captain Shore moves to unlock a large cabinet set into the wall. She pulls two revolvers out of the drawer.]//

**SCP-4793:** Oh no. I couldn&#39;t hear for a day after we shot those last time.

**Shore:** Well, you&#39;ll still be able to hear if you actually put your ear protection in right this time.

**SCP-4793:** How about we just spar? That&#39;s always easy, right?

**Shore:** I know you&#39;re stalling, Androcles. Once this is done, we can spar. Eighteen shots. That isn&#39;t that hard, right?

**SCP-4793:** Okay. 

**Shore:** Good. 

//[Captain Shore hands SCP-4793 a revolver. Taking their positions in the stalls, both level their firearms.]// 

**SCP-4793:** Ready?

**Shore:** Weapons hot.

//[SCP-4793 fires off all six rounds in rapid succession. All the bullets pass through the center of the target. Captain Shore has fired four rounds in the same time span, with her shots falling within half an inch of each other and the bulls-eye.]//

**SCP-4793:** Your stance is off.

**Shore:** What do you mean?

//[SCP-4793 slides in behind Captain Shore. Reaching forward, they wrap their hands around hers.]//

**SCP-4793:** Feel where my foot is? On the outside of yours?

**Shore:** Yeah...

**SCP-4793:** It&#39;s too far out. A wide stance is good, but you&#39;re a little overextended. //[Taps her foot gently.]// Just a touch.

//[SCP-4793 disengages and steps back as Captain Shore levels her pistol and fires. The shot passes through the center of the target.]//

**Shore:** Hell. You were right.

**SCP-4793:** Just trying to be helpful, Holly.

**Shore:** Yeah, but you could have just tapped my foot. 

**SCP-4793:** Huh. How about that.

**Shore:** You got something you wanna sa-

//[A portion of the ventilation falls to the floor. From the gap in the ceiling, a dark form emerges and jumps to the ground. Both Captain Shore and SCP-4793 recoil. The creature tackles Captain Shore, causing the stall to collapse on top of her. A gunshot is heard. Turning back towards SCP-4793, it starts to emit a series of inhumane laughs.]//

**SCP-4793:** What the fuck is that.

**Shore:** //[Grunting.]// I... don&#39;t know. My gun. It&#39;s by the wall.

//[Captain Shore points to the opposite wall, where her firearm is laying.]// 

**SCP-4793:** Got it.

//[SCP-4793 dives towards the gun. They wrap their fingers around it before being knocked back by the monster. SCP-4793 rolls into a combat stance and points it at the creature.]// 

**Shore:** Pull the trigger! 

**SCP-4793:** //[Grimacing]// Okay-

//[SCP-4793 pulls the trigger and the revolver clicks.]// 

**Shore:** Fuck.

//[The creature presses the attack, bludgeoning SCP-4793 with its wings and scratching with claws. After kicking it off of them, SCP-4793 pulls the leg off of a metal table. Within a few seconds, it has morphed into a short sword.]// 

**SCP-4793:** //[Pointing the weapon at the creature.]// Stop. I don&#39;t want to hurt you.

**Shore:** The fuck are you doing? 

**SCP-4793:** It&#39;s intelligent. I-I think it&#39;s scared. 

//[The creature cocks its head at SCP-4793 and turns to face Captain Shore, exposing a mouth full of crooked and sharp teeth.]//

**Shore:** Andy, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s friendly.

//[The creature lunges at Captain Shore, but SCP-4793 manages to intercept it. The creature is impaled on the end of the short sword and SCP-4793 exhales deeply.]//

**Shore:** What was that?

//[SCP-4793 tosses the sword and body aside and begins to move the remnants of the stall off of Captain Shore.]//

**SCP-4793:** I don&#39;t know. Some kind of nightmare?

**Shore:** No, I mean what you just did. I&#39;ve never seen anything move that fast.

**SCP-4793:** I... listened to my instincts. 

**Shore:** Does that mean your memory...

**SCP-4793:** Yeah, it&#39;s all coming back. Slowly. But we&#39;ve got bigger problems...

**Shore:** Shit! //[Removes her radio from her belt]// Hailing all channels, this is Captain Holly Shore of Mobile Task Force Upsilon-11. We have a containment breach in progress. Hostile entities in unknown numbers. Please respond. Over

**Radio:** Roger that. This is Lieutenant Commander Ashley Crowley. Code Red going up. Over.

//[Several seconds later, klaxons begin sounding.]// 

**Shore:** Attention, Upsilon-11. Rendezvous the armory on Level 3.

**SCP-4793:** Armory? 

**Shore:** A precaution. We don&#39;t know what we&#39;re up against.

**SCP-4793:** Understood.

**Shore:** Are you okay with this? 

**SCP-4793:** You could have died. I can&#39;t let that happen.

**Shore:** Alright. Let&#39;s move.

[BEGIN LOG] 

//[Doctor Eleanor Fitz-Patrick is seen observing a single instance of Project X06 through a reinforced window. The creature is black, bipedal, and appears to be watching Dr. Fitz-Patrick.]//

**Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** What in God&#39;s name did he do here...

//[The door to the chamber opens, startling Dr. Fitz-Patrick. Site Director Jack Hargraves enters.]//

**Director Hargraves:** Ah. Ellie. Glad you could make it. 

**Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Don&#39;t you call me Ellie. This isn&#39;t a casual meeting. We&#39;re not friends. 
   
**Director Hargraves:** Who&#39;s saying we can&#39;t be?

**Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Everything that I stand for? All my moral and ethical codes? It’s your delusions of grandeur made manifest. 
   
**Director Hargraves:** Don&#39;t get self-righteous. All those pretty words don&#39;t make me care any more about the meaning. As for what I&#39;ve done here, I&#39;ve made humanity&#39;s savior.

**Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Like hell you have.
   
**Director Hargraves:** What&#39;s your problem, Eleanor? I may have created something that could save the world! An intelligent lifeform, capable of reproducing asexually and speaking. 

**Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** You&#39;re kidding me right? You took //Alien// and mashed in //Jurassic Park//. Then you had the audacity to give it near-Human level intelligence? Who gave you the right?
   
**Director Hargraves:** Well, who could stop me? You? 

**Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Yes me. That monstrosity in there? I was sent here to-

//[Director Hargraves turns his head towards the enclosure. All color drains from his face.]//
   
**Director Hargraves:** We need to go. Now.

**Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** //[Flustered]// What? What do you mean?
   
**Director Hargraves:** There were two X06s in that enclosure.

**Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Fuck.
   
**Director Hargraves:** We need to contact Site Sec-

//[A ventilation shaft falls to the ground behind them. Falling from above, the X06-1 spreads its wings and screams at the pair.]//

**X06-1:** H-h-arrr-

//[Dr Fitz-Patrick and Director Hargraves sprint towards the door and begin to fumble with the handle.]//

**Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Open the goddamn door, Jack!
   
**Director Hargraves:** I&#39;m trying!

//[X06-1 moves slowly closer, observing them.]//

**Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Fuck fuck fuck. 

//[Moving forward, X06-1 slams a chair into the air.]//

[BEGIN LOG] 

//[MTF Upsilon-11 (&#34;Avalon&#39;s Wake&#34;) is seen surrounding the central table of the armory, along with SCP-4793. Lieutenant Commander Ashley Crowley is using a Foundation issue laptop.]//

**Crowley:** I&#39;ve got a lot of heat sigs from the basement and moving up, quick.

**Zimmerman:** How long till they hit the D-Block and Gen-Pop?

**Crowley:** Not long. I&#39;m getting new hits every minute.

**McCalloway:** I&#39;m calling Security. They can lock those sectors down. 

**Crowley:** Not sure that&#39;ll help. These things seem to be moving through the vents.

**Shore:** Yeah the one we dropped was in the vents too. Crowley, find out what this thing is.

**Crowley:** Already on it.

**Shore:** Everybody, I want full tactical gear. 

**Jenkins:** Weapons?

**Shore:** Pick your favorite but grab a CQC piece too. It&#39;s gonna be tight once we hit Maintenance.

//[The group disperses, except for Crowley and SCP-4793. Captain Shore turns and pulls them aside.]//

**Shore:** You need to grab a weapon if you&#39;re coming with us.

**SCP-4793:** I-I know.

**Shore:** It&#39;s not too late to back out. But once we leave this room-

**SCP-4793:** I know. But I&#39;m coming with you. I&#39;ve lost too many people. I can&#39;t let it happen to you.

**Shore:** Which is why you have to pull it together. If you freeze up, it&#39;s gonna get me or somebody on my team killed.

//[SCP-4793 nods and walks towards a bin filled with broken ceramic plates and damaged Kevlar vests. After 5 seconds of contact with the container, the materials reconfigure themselves into a set of armor consisting of a chest piece, gauntlets, and greaves. Several minutes pass as the rest of the team dons their gear.]//

**Shore:** Crowley, got anything yet? 

**Crowley:** Not yet. It doesn&#39;t seem to match anything on file.

**Jenkins:** How far&#39;s the spread? 

**Crowley:** Can&#39;t do everything at once.

**Shore:** Check the Project-X files. I don&#39;t think this is something we found.

//[Rapid typing.]//

**Crowley:** Got something. Project-X06. This doesn&#39;t look good, Captain.

**Shore:** What&#39;s wrong?

**Crowley:** Whatever Hargraves was trying to do, I don&#39;t think it worked. These things... They’re something else. 

**Shore:** Explain.

**Crowley:** We&#39;re looking at hardened skin, advanced reflexes, and intelligence comparable to humans.

**Jenkins:** Can&#39;t be that tough. Androcles killed one.

**Zimmerman:** He also picked up a grown man like he was a doll and threw him into a wall.

//[SCP-4793 winces.]//

**McCalloway:** How are there so many of them? We would have heard if they had a farm like this running. 

**Crowley:** One sec. //[Pause.]// Okay, it looks like they&#39;re capable of reproducing after one feeding. Whatever there is on what a feeding means is covered in black ink. But they grow fast. According to this, that one you fought? That couldn&#39;t have been more than an hour old. //[Pause.]// That&#39;s weird...

**Shore:** What&#39;s wrong? Something else? 

**Crowley:** Yeah. I tried to send this file to Overwatch Command so they could inform our backup on the threat. But this file doesn&#39;t exist on the network. //[Rapid typing.]// Nothing exists on the network.

**Shore:** Like the system is down?

**Crowley:** No. Hargraves must have moved all our documents to offline, local servers. According to this, the only things we&#39;ve logged in the last nine years are a handful of SCPs, all high profile incidents. 4451, the monster in Kansas City and that thing in Dallas. Basically anything with a PoI or a GoI involved.

**Jenkins:** We must have recovered over 100 items in that time.

**Shore:** His weapons program... He wanted to keep it off the O5s&#39; radar. Bastard. Okay, what&#39;s the most dangerous thing still on SCIP net? What&#39;s our backup expecting? 

//[Rapid typing.]//

**Crowley:** A girl who makes your blood boil if she touches you. I&#39;m gonna try to get the Site AI to move the X06 file to the main network and flag it as an active breach, but there are no guarantees. I have no idea what else Hargraves did to the site. 

**Shore:** Christ. Alright, gear up Crowley. 

//[Crowley closes the laptop and opens her locker. SCP-4793 pulls Captain Shore aside.]//

**SCP-4793:** Holly, this is a suicide mission.

**Shore:** Yeah... I know.

**SCP-4793:** Then I have to come with you.

**Shore:** Why?

**SCP-4793:** It&#39;s like you said, one magic soldier.

**Shore:** But what if you lose control? What if you leave here as the old you?

**SCP-4793:** If you survive, it&#39;ll be worth it. 

**Jenkins:** Hey Androcles, you gonna grab a weapon or...? 

//[SCP-4793 grimaces, then tears the door off of a locker, which becomes a small, circular shield. They then pull the metal legs off a chair, transforming them into a kopis.]//

**Shore:** This isn&#39;t gonna be easy. We&#39;ve got a lot of ground to cover. Our backup is coming in blind. These monsters are smart and tough. But if it was easy...

**All MTF Members:** It wouldn&#39;t be an Avalon mission!

**Shore:** Fuck yeah! Alright, body cams on. We&#39;re rolling out.

//[MTF Upsilon is in an express elevator bound for Floor Ten.]//

**Zimmerman:** Been awhile since I fought beside a scip... Not since, well, him.

**SCP-4793:** //[Softly.]// 076?

**Zimmerman:** Yeah...

**McCalloway:** Captain, how do we know he&#39;s not gonna flip his shit and go all Omega-7 on us?

**Shore:** Androcles isn’t anything like 076. You&#39;ve been there for every single thing we&#39;ve run with him. 

**McCalloway:** Yeah, but if he chickens out, we&#39;re still all dead. Not much difference.

**Jenkins:** Will you just shut up? We don&#39;t need to think about this right now.

**Elevator:** Welcome to Floor Ten, General Housing.

//[The MTF departs. There are papers and the bodies of security personnel scattered around the hallway. Most of the lighting fixtures have been damaged and several are hanging from their sockets and flickering. Captain Shore touches her earpiece.]// 

**Shore:** Holiday. Bring up emergency lighting on floor ten.

//[The corridor is flooded with soft red lighting from several backup units. An X06 is seen running in a far off cross hallway.]//

**Crowley:** It&#39;s heading to the dorms.

//[The MTF gives chase, heading for the dormitory. The door to the sector has been sealed and the body of a staff member is leaning against it, with an X06 latched onto it.]//

**Jenkins:** Christ! //[Jenkins opens fire.]//

//[The sound of the rifle reverberates off the walls. Three bullets strike the X06 in the head, chest, and stomach. It emits a screech and falls to the ground. A pool of blood is rapidly spreading out from the hole in its stomach. Crowley leans down and checks the body.]//

**Crowley:** He&#39;s gone. I&#39;m guessing it was exsanguination. 

**Jenkins:** Care to say that simpler?

**Zimmerman:** Blood loss. That thing drained him. That&#39;s why there&#39;s so much blood coming from it.

**SCP-4793:** It&#39;s a blood meal.

**Jenkins:** What?

**SCP-4793:** Um. Mosquitos usually just eat pollen. But the females need a &#34;blood meal&#34; to actually make the casing for their eggs. I was reading about it last week.

**Shore:** So that&#39;s what feeding is. Crowley, how long till you can get this open?

**Crowley:** Few seconds. It&#39;s just in lockdown.

//[Crowley pops the cover of the panel off with a knife. After examining it for several seconds, she lets out a sigh.]//

**Crowley:** Scratch that. They must have shot the lock on the other side. This thing&#39;s got more shrapnel than circuits.

**Shore:** How long?

**Crowley:** No promises, but maybe, five minutes?

//[Inhuman laughing is heard from several directions around the team.]//

**Zimmerman:** Company incoming.

**Shore:** Weapons hot. Jenkins, watch Crowley. Ace and I&#39;ll take left. Andy and McCalloway take right.

//[SCP-4793 and McCalloway take a defensive position. McCalloway shoulders his automatic shotgun and looks at SCP-4793.]//

**McCalloway:** I don&#39;t know why Holly brought you along, but don&#39;t get me killed.

**SCP-4793:** I-I won&#39;t. 

**McCalloway:** Sound more sure about it. Look alive. I&#39;ve got shadows ahead.

//[The sounds of gunfire are heard from behind the camera. A small pack of seven X06&#39;s begin to move slowly down the hallway towards McCalloway and SCP-4793.]//

**McCalloway:** Contacts!

//[McCalloway fires, the slug hitting the leader in the head. The pack breaks formation. He fires two more shots, striking one in the chest and another in the throat. SCP-4793 moves forward and uses their shield to catch one in mid-lunge, slamming it with enough force to crush it against the concrete wall. They pull their shield out and manages to cover themself before another X06 collides with them. Without looking, McCalloway draws his pistol and shoots the X06 twice.]//

**SCP-4793:** Thanks.

**McCalloway:** //[Downs another X06 and turns his head.]// Not now.

//[The last X06 lunges at McCalloway. Pushing him aside, SCP-4793 brings their kopis down and decapitates it.]//

**McCalloway:** Damn... 

**SCP-4793:** How... how do you make it look so easy?

**McCalloway:** What, this? It&#39;s not.

//[McCalloway begins reloading his shotgun.]//

**McCalloway:** But it&#39;s them, //[Gestures behind him.]// or my friends. Gotta be ready to make the sacrifice play. How&#39;s it going over there, Captain?

**Shore:** //[Off Camera.]// Engaged 6 hostiles. All downed. You?

**McCalloway:** Seven.

**Shore:** //[Off Camera.]// How&#39;s that door coming, Crowley?

**Crowley:** //[Off Camera.]// Almost... //[A hissing sound is heard.]// Got it!

//[The camera turns, and the MTF enters the sector. The hallways are clear but empty. McCalloway punches the control pad on the inside of the doorframe and destroys what&#39;s left of it. It sparks and the door slams shut.]//

**Jenkins:** Doesn&#39;t look like they made it in here yet. 

**Shore:** But where is everyone?

**Zimmerman:** Hiding. I wouldn&#39;t want to have to fight any of those creatures unarmed.

**McCalloway:** Those dogs weren&#39;t so bad.

//[A person&#39;s head appears in the doorway of a room. He soon emerges.]//

**Staff Member 1:** Oh thank God. It&#39;s not those... things.

//[Twenty-five people emerge from the rooms into the hallway.]//

**Staff Member 2:** Is that Upsilon-11?

**Staff Member 3:** Wait? Is that 4793?

**Shore:** We&#39;re here to pull you out. Is this everyone?

**Staff Member 2:** Everyone that made it here... before we had to close the doors.

//[Zimmerman pulls Captain Shore aside.]//

**Zimmerman:** Look, this is probably everyone still alive.

**Shore:** I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re-

**SCP-4793:** Is Doctor Fitz-Patrick here? Eleanor Fitz-Patrick?

**Staff Member 1:** No. She got transferred to the X06 Project so she&#39;s probably...

//[SCP-4793&#39;s shoulders fall.]// 

**Shore:** Hey, we don&#39;t know if she was able to make it to the D-Block.

**Zimmerman:** Captain, we need to move. This is spreading fast.

**Shore:** Roger that, Ace. People, we need to move. There&#39;s a freight elevator at the other entrance. Leads right up to the-

//[Camera shows the hallway of the Living Quarters within Site-20. There are twenty-five staff members assembled in front of the MTF.]//

**Zimmerman:** Captain, we need to move. This is spreading fast.

**Shore:** Roger that, Ace. People, we need to move. There&#39;s a freight elevator at the other entrance. Leads right up to the-

//[The sounds of grinding metal is heard.]//

**Crowley:** Jake! Behind you!

//[Camera sharply turns to Warrant Officer McCalloway. The door behind him has been torn open and a large creature[[footnote]]Designated X06-2[[/footnote]] appears in the hole. It reaches in and grabs McCalloway, slamming his head off the top of the frame and pulling him into the darkness.]//

**Shore:** Fuck! Crowley, Jenkins, Andy, get these people to the surface! Now!

**SCP-4793:** But-

**Shore:** That&#39;s an order! Ace, with me!

//[Zimmerman vaults the door and fires off a few shots at the fleeing creature.]//

**Zimmerman:** It&#39;s headed for the elevator!

**Shore:** We need to get him back!

//[Both Shore and Zimmerman take off down the hallway. They reach an elevator shaft. Zimmerman shines his flashlight down the hole. It gleams off the creature, which shoots him a snarl before exiting the shaft.]//

**Zimmerman:** That&#39;s D-Block. There&#39;s no straight path down there. Gotta go through Floor Eleven.

**Shore:** Fuck. 

//[The pair move into the stairwell.]//

**Zimmerman:** Did you see the size of that thing?

**Shore:** Yeah. What was that? Everything else here was just fucked-up dogs.

**Zimmerman:** That was like one of those raptors from Jurassic Park but bigger.

//[They reach the bottom and take a second to catch their breath.]//

**Zimmerman:** We going in loud?

//[Captain Shore doesn&#39;t respond. Bracing herself, she kicks the doorknob out and knocks the door wide open. Several X06s are in the room and look at the source of the noise.]//

**Zimmerman:** Loud it is. 

//[He levels his light machine gun and starts firing into the room. Captain Shore joins him. Slowly, they begin to make progress across the floor.]//

**Shore:** Halfway. 

**Zimmerman:** Copy that.

//[From behind them comes the sound of laughter as X06s begin to emerge from rooms they&#39;d passed by. More begin to fill out the way ahead.]//

**Shore:** It&#39;s a trap.

**Zimmerman:** That big thing wanted us down here. Is there a way out behind?

**Shore:** No, but we won&#39;t survive in the open. Move!

//[The pair begin to run towards a laboratory. Zimmerman slams the door as the first X06 catches up with them.]//

**Shore:** Hold the door! I&#39;ll find something! 

//[Captain Shore begins moving a large bookcase in front of the door.]//

**Zimmerman:** That&#39;s not gonna hold them.

**Shore:** Help me flip these tables. We need a barricade.

//[Several moments pass as they place tables on their side. The banging on the door gets louder and louder and the bookcase begins to slide along the floor.]// 

**Shore:** What&#39;s your ammo look like?

**Zimmerman:** Bout 75 in the LMG.

**Shore:** Got two full mags for my rifle.

**Zimmerman:** Let&#39;s give em hell.

//[The door stops banging and the sounds of screams can be heard outside.]//

**Zimmerman:** What the fuck was that?

//[Over the next thirty minutes, the screams slowly fade to nothing. Another minute passes and the door is kicked open. Zimmerman and Captain Shore fire off several shots, knocking the figure backward.]//

**Shore:** Do you think that&#39;s-

//[A figure flies into the room, kicking the table and sending the pair several meters back. Captain Shore rolls into a firing position and the camera pans to reveal a humanoid, covered in blood and deep cuts, standing over them.]//

**Shore:** Androcles? 

//[SCP-4793 looks at Captain Shore with no sign of recognition. They lift their kopis and raise their shield into a defensive position.]//

**Shore:** Wait, it&#39;s us. It&#39;s Holly!

//[SCP-4793 blinks for several moments and falls to their knees.]//

**SCP-4793:** Oh Gods, did... I hurt you? I&#39;m so sorry.

**Shore:** No, we shot you. //[Pauses.]// How are you still walking? You should be dead.

**Zimmerman:** Where are the others?

**SCP-4793:** It was a trap. They wanted to split us up. As soon as we stepped out on the other side, we got hit by one of those big guys and a swarm of the dogs. We only lost two of the doctors. I think. But Crowley got hurt really bad. She and Jenkins are up top right now. 

**Shore:** Why aren&#39;t you with them?

**SCP-4793:** If they set a trap for us, it meant you two were walking into an ambush. I-I had to. 

**Zimmerman:** What about Ashley? What happened?

**SCP-4793:** One of the big ones nearly took her arm off. The dogs are dangerous in numbers but those things are just. I don&#39;t know.

//[Zimmerman stands up and starts walking over to the door.]//

**Shore:** You didn&#39;t even recognize me when you came in. I&#39;m worried about you. You need to get out of here.

**SCP-4793:** No. I need to find Doctor Fitz-Patrick. Even if she&#39;s... //[Pause.]// And I need to keep you safe.

**Shore:** I don&#39;t need to be kept safe. 

**Zimmerman:** Hey Holly? You should come see this.

//[Zimmerman turns and steps into the hallway as Captain Shore walks over to him. The hallway is filled with dead or dying X06s and X06-2s in an unbroken line that leads into the open area where they had came from. Chunks of flesh and bone are sticking to the walls and a thin layer of blood covers the floor everywhere.]//

**Shore:** Did... you do this? 

**SCP-4793:** I-I had to. It was-

**Zimmerman:** Look, Holly, you know what this reminds of? 

**Shore:** Yeah. I know.

**Zimmerman:** He&#39;s extremely dangerous. If he loses it, do you think we&#39;d be able to stop him? I don&#39;t want him to come with us...

**Shore:** I agree. //[Pauses.]// There&#39;s a &#39;but&#39; at the end of the sentence. Spill it.

**Zimmerman:** He&#39;s our only chance of getting to D-Block. He’s probably the only reason we&#39;re alive right now.

**Shore:** Okay. 

//[SCP-4793 walks towards them.]//

**SCP-4793:** We... should move.

//[They step past Captain Shore and Zimmerman, keeping their head looking at the ceiling. Their breathing gets more rapid. The MTFs follows and they reach the other staircase in three minutes.]//

**Zimmerman:** Ready for another adventure? 

**SCP-4793:** No.

**Zimmerman:** Too bad. You picked one hell of a day-

[BEGIN LOG] 

//[Captain Shore descends the staircase and pauses briefly at the door before opening it. The hallway is clear, but a barricade made of chairs and tables sits at the end. The bodies of several X06s are lying front of it, as well as several corpses clad in orange jumpsuits.]//

**Zimmerman:** Damn, I think I turned my body cam off.

**Shore:** Looks like the D-Class put up a fight.

**SCP-4793:** If they didn&#39;t block the elevator, they only boxed themselves in. 

//[The trio climb the barricade. As they turn the corner, they see the open elevator shaft and an X06-2 lying motionless on the floor in a pool of blood.]//

**Shore:** That&#39;s the one that grabbed McCalloway. But where is he?

**Zimmerman:** Better question, what killed it?

**Unknown Voice:** Who the fuck&#39;s there? We&#39;re armed!

//[Captain Shore and Zimmerman shoulder their weapons and move towards the opening to the D-Class containment block. Hiding behind makeshift barriers, a mixture of D-Class and Security Officers can be seen. At the sight of the MTF, they lower their weapons, which are mostly knives and sharpened broom handles.]//

**D-1825:** Oh shit. A fucking MTF? Never thought I&#39;d be happy to see you fucks. You here to spring us from this death trap?

**Shore:** Are you guys... //[Gestures to the Security Officers and the D-Class.]// working together?

**Security Officer Jones:** Well, yeah. We&#39;re mostly all friends here.

**D-1736:** None of the doctors really use human test subjects, so we mostly just play cards down here and shoot the shit.

**D-2398:** Yeah! Jones over here&#39;s wife is pregnant //[Gestures to Security Officer Jones.]// and he says once I get out, he&#39;s gonna make me their godparent!

//[Several moments of silence follow.]//

**D-1916:** Nah, we&#39;re just fucking with you. Gallows humor. //[Nervous chuckle.]//

**D-3497:** It&#39;s man versus fucking Predator down here. Shit like D-Class and Guard don&#39;t mean anything now. 

**Shore:** Um... Okay. But yes, we are here to pull you out of here. First, that thing in the elevator, where&#39;s the man it was carrying?

**Security Officer Jones:** Oh. He&#39;s one of you? Follow me. 

//[Officer Jones moves to one of the cells and Captain Shore follows. Warrant Officer McCalloway is laying on a cot with bedsheets wrapped around his sternum. A large bloodstain is leaking through the cloth. A D-Class is taking his vitals and is about to administer an unknown medication with a syringe.]//

**McCalloway:** Well Hell. If it isn&#39;t my buddies.

**Shore:** What happened to you? 

**McCalloway:** Well that thing grabbed me. You know that. Knocked me out for a little bit. Woke up when it hit the floor of that elevator. Next thing I know, the damn thing gets swarmed. Left me a little parting gift though. //[Gestures at the wound, pauses and coughs heavily into his hand. When he pulls it away, it&#39;s covered in blood.]//

//[The D-Class puts Captain Shore aside.]//

**D-4534:** Your friend&#39;s injuries are... severe. That monster&#39;s claw caught him in the chest and almost certainly punctured a lung. If he doesn&#39;t get to a real doctor soon, he&#39;s gonna die.

**Zimmerman:** What were you about to give him? 

**D-4534:** Morphine. We pulled it, as well as some other things, from a surgery suite upstairs before they overran that sector.

**Shore:** Ace, can you help this man with McCalloway? I&#39;m gonna see if there&#39;s a way out.

//[Captain Shore turns and exits the cell. Pausing for a moment, she begins to walk towards SCP-4793.]//

**Shore:** A word, please.

**SCP-4793:** Hey.

**Shore:** You&#39;re not okay, are you?

**SCP-4793:** No. I&#39;m not. Did you see what I did back there? What I&#39;m capable of? I don&#39;t want to be that person. 

**Shore:** Nobody wants to be that person. When we send the D-Class up, you&#39;re going with them. That&#39;s final.

**SCP-4793:** What about you and Ace? Shouldn&#39;t you wait for back up? 

**Shore:** What back up? By the time another MTF shows up, it&#39;ll be too late. We need to blow the reactor.

**SCP-4793:** But that&#39;s suicide.

**Shore:** This isn&#39;t about what I want anymore. If I don&#39;t fight, a lot more people are gonna get killed. 

**SCP-4793:** Then I&#39;m coming with you.

**Shore:** No. Dying, I can deal with. Watching you lose yourself, I can&#39;t.

//[Captain Shore turns away and walks towards Security Officer Jones.]//

**Shore:** What&#39;s the fastest way out of here?

**Security Officer Jones:** The freight elevator. //[Jones points to the elevator doors in the back of the Guards&#39; Office.]//

**Shore:** Well, why haven&#39;t you used it?

**Security Officer Jones:** We don&#39;t have cards for it. If a D-Class got one-

**Shore:** Yeah I get it. But my card works. So we&#39;re getting out of here. Now

//[A cheer goes up from the assembled personnel. A metallic twang is heard and the lookout comes running back into the room.]// 

**D-1825:** Guys! I think something is trying to cut the uh cord thing in the elevator.

//[Captain Shore removes her keycard from her belt and hands it to Jones.]// 

**Shore:** Get everyone in the elevator. We&#39;ll hold em off.

//[Camera opens to a series of barricades constructed out of cots and cell furniture and six D-Class personnel are standing behind them, armed with standard-issue handguns and shotguns. Turning, the camera shows a Security Officer standing in the Guard&#39;s Office, surrounded by D-Class. A man in a torn and bloodstained Euclid uniform and a set of unknown armor is standing near the entrance to the office.]// 

**Shore:** Jones. Is that thing running?

**Jones:** Yeah, weight sensors say it&#39;s empty. But it might take a little while running on emergency power.

**Shore:** Copy that. //[Turns to the D-Class at the barricades.]// Alright, thanks for volunteering. It&#39;s about to get bloody in here. 

**Zimmerman:** But we&#39;re gonna hold the line until that elevator gets to the surface. 

**Shore:** Is that understood?

**D-1825:** Hell yeah! 

**D-3497:** This shit&#39;s like //Alien// but Ripley&#39;s got fucking Seal Team Six backing her up. Can&#39;t wait to drop some Xenos.

**Shore:** You are... really gung-ho about this.

**D-2319:** We were all Marines before this. Same squad and everything. Defensive measures are kinda second nature to us.

**Shore:** If we get out of this alive, I&#39;m gonna recommend a transfer to a Task Force for all of you.

**D-1736:** What&#39;s it like?

**McCalloway:** //[From the adjacent cell.]// The benefits are okay, the grind sucks, but the job security? //[Coughing.]// Incredible.

**Zimmerman:** That&#39;s the first joke you&#39;ve ever told, Jake.

**McCalloway:** Maybe if you shove it up your ass, Ace, it&#39;ll last longer.

//[A metallic twange is heard.]//

**Shore:** They&#39;re almost through the cable.

**Zimmerman:** Once that&#39;s open, they&#39;ll probably push from the other sides. 

//[A ding is heard and the camera pans to see the freight elevator doors open. The crowd of D-Class pushes inside, accompanied by several Security Officers.]//

**Shore:** Jones! Get as far from this site as you can. It’s gonna get hot in here soon. 

//[A murmur goes up from the eight D-Class who are outside the elevator. SCP-4793 grimaces.]//

**Jones:** But Site-20 doesn&#39;t have a nuke.

**Shore:** We&#39;re gonna improvise.

//[The doors close, leaving only the MTF, fifteen D-Class, and SCP-4793 in the block. Several minutes pass as the cable continues to reverberate. Several of the D-Class begin to fidget. The cable snaps and the elevator plummets down the shaft. After a few seconds, the hand of an X06 grabs the edge and begins to pull itself up.]// 

**Shore:** Here we go!

**D-2319:** MTF Chain Gang[[footnote]]Not an officially recognized Mobile Task Force[[/footnote]]! Fuck em up!

//[X06s begin to flood the room, attacking from the elevator shaft and the sides. The D-Class and MTF members open fire. The first waves are killed or pushed back.]//

**Shore:** Doctor! Move McCalloway to the elevator! Everyone else! Start falling back!

//[Captain Shore fires at several X06s and turns on another when her gun emits a click. She draws her handgun and starts moving back towards the door to the office. Four X06 crawlers begin to move towards her and Captain Shore terminates two of them before tripping on an unknown obstacle.]//

**SCP-4793:** Holly!

//[An X06 jumps on Captain Shore. She pushes her arm into its throat as it starts to claw at her. She pulls a knife from her belt and stabs it three times in the neck before shoving it off of her.]//

**X06:** H-H-Holly...

//[An unknown force drags Captain Shore backward. The camera shows the battle is going poorly: Two of the D-Class have left their positions, one is lying motionless on the floor, and Zimmerman has switched to his shotgun. The camera begins to swing wildly as Captain Shore is pulled closer to the office door.]// 

**SCP-4793:** It&#39;s me! Stop fighting. 

//[Captain Shore stands up. She looks at her arm; the sleeve is torn and it&#39;s bleeding.]//

**Shore:** Get back! The lift should be here soon! 

//[The five remaining D-Class and Zimmerman sprint to the final barricade while Captain Shore lays down suppressing fire. All seven begin to fire at the oncoming X06s.]//

**Shore:** Where&#39;s McCalloway? Where&#39;s the vet?

//[D-4534 stumbles out of a cell as an X06-2 lunges into the room. He vaults the barricade and collapses on the ground.]// 

**D-4534:** //[Breathing heavily]// Gave... Morphine... He... wouldn&#39;t... He grabbed... the  

//[A gunshot is heard and the X06-2&#39;s arm falls out of the room as Warrant Officer McCalloway emerges from the cell, wielding his automatic shotgun in one hand and his sidearm in the other.]//

**McCalloway:** Who&#39;s next?! Come and fucking get some!

**D-4534:** Adrenaline... 

//[Three X06-2s and seven X06s converge on McCalloway, who begins to move towards the elevator shaft. The freight elevator dings and the camera pans to see Warrant Officer Jenkins step out and fire through the glass window at the X06-2s.]//

**McCalloway:** Get the fuck outta here!

//[The waiting D-Class rush into the elevator, while the five surviving D-Class combatants move to provide fire support beside Jenkins.]// 

**Zimmerman:** Jake!

//[Zimmerman begins to move across the cellblock towards McCalloway.]//

**Jenkins:** We need to go!

**Shore:** Ace and I are gonna blow the reactor!

**SCP-4793:** You won&#39;t make it there!

//[Zimmerman has passed the doorway leading into the cell block and is only a few meters from McCalloway, who has sustained several severe injuries. An X06 lunges at Zimmerman, who hits it in the chest with a blast from his shotgun. McCalloway discards his firearms and draws a large combat knife from his belt as an X06-2 slashes him down his back. He turns and stabs upward into its skull.]//

**McCalloway:** I&#39;m ready! How &#39;bout you! //[Gesturing to an X06.]// 

//[The hand of an X06-2 reaches up and grabs McCalloway&#39;s leg. He looks down at it, swears, and is pulled off his feet and into the elevator shaft. Zimmerman dives and grabs his hand. He manages to hold McCalloway for a few seconds before being dragged into the shaft himself.]//

**Shore:** Ace!

//[SCP-4793 grabs Captain Shore and pulls her into the office, slamming the door behind them.]// 

**Jenkins:** Fucking Hell!

**SCP-4793:** You can&#39;t save them. 

**Shore:** I have to kill all these damn things!

**SCP-4793:** You need to get a fucking grip, Holly. Remember the first thing you said to me?

**Jenkins:** Hurry up! We can&#39;t hold them for long!

//[Jenkins and the D-Class Combatants begin to back up towards the elevator.]//

**Shore:** What?!

**SCP-4793:** &#34;We&#39;re the Foundation. We keep people safe.&#34; Here&#39;s people. Keep them safe.

//[Jenkins is inside, still firing into the X06s as they move closer. SCP-4793 pushes Holly and she stumbles into the elevator.]//

**SCP-4793:** Hold her! Don&#39;t let her out!

//[They turn away and raise their sword and shield as the X06s pass the final barricade before the office. Several D-Class grab Captain Shore and hold her. SCP-4793 turns back to look at Captain Shore as the elevator doors close.]//

**Shore:** Androcles!

**SCP-4793:** I&#39;m sorry.

**Zimmerman:** //[Coughing.]// Wha... What happ..

//[Twelve minutes pass. Footsteps can be heard. A man in a bloodstained and torn Euclid uniform wearing unknown armor and a helmet of unknown manufacture appears in the frame.]//

**SCP-4793:** Oh... They&#39;re... I don&#39;t know what I was hoping for...

**Zimmerman:** //[Cough.]// Not.. //[Cough.]// Yet. 

**SCP-4793:** Ace? Sweet Hephaestus... You fell like fourteen floors.

**Zimmerman:** And I&#39;m feeling every foot.  //[Cough.]// What did you call me?

**SCP-4793:** Hephaestus. God of Fire and Metalworking.

**Zimmerman:** Why? //[Cough.]// 

**SCP-4793:** He was thrown off a mountain by his mother for being ugly and survived.

**Zimmerman:** I&#39;d laugh if I was in any shape.

**SCP-4793:** Is McCalloway...?

**Zimmerman:** No chance. But the bastard died as he lived. Stupid as hell and running straight into danger.

**SCP-4793:** Ares would have liked him. 

**Zimmerman:** Is Holly safe? She&#39;s not with you.

**SCP-4793:** I pushed her into the elevator. Told the D-Class not to let her out.

**Zimmerman:** So what&#39;s the plan? 

**SCP-4793:** I don&#39;t have one. Getting down here was pure luck. Finding you alive was a miracle. //[Pause.]// Can you walk? 

//[Zimmerman leans forward and then falls back.]//

**Zimmerman:** I can feel my legs... //[Cough.]// Just can&#39;t move em.

**SCP-4793:** Okay. I&#39;m gonna grab one of the carts and put you on it. And McCalloway. Then I&#39;ll get you to the freight elevator.

**Zimmerman:** That&#39;s not what I meant. The X06s.

**SCP-4793:** I&#39;m gonna blow up the reactor.

**Zimmerman:** Yeah, but how?

**SCP-4793:** I... don&#39;t know. But I have to.

**SCP-4793:** There we go.

**Zimmerman:** Why did you come back? //[Cough.]// For all you knew, I was dead. 

**SCP-4793:** You weren&#39;t gonna leave McCalloway behind when that big thing grabbed him.

//[SCP-4793 begins to push the cart. Zimmerman draws his sidearm and checks the magazine.]//

**Zimmerman:** Where&#39;d you get the helmet? Looks sick.

**SCP-4793:** R&amp;D. It&#39;s a prototype for some kinda space program. Space combat. //[Laughing.]// I still can&#39;t believe humans went to space. Now, we&#39;re getting ready to fight up there? 

**Zimmerman:** Yeah, that&#39;s pretty crazy. //[Cough.]// Guess since you made it down here, you had to fight your way through.

//[SCP-4793 is silent for several moments.]//

**SCP-4793:** Yeah. I didn&#39;t want to. Feels like more of me is slipping away. 

**Zimmerman:** Nobody ever said this job was good for your soul. //[Cough.]// Helps when the thing on the other side of the gun isn&#39;t human, but it never gets easier.

**SCP-4793:** How do you sleep at night? All the things you&#39;ve seen, everything you&#39;ve done? 

**Zimmerman:** I don&#39;t. Toss and turn every night. See a lot of faces, people I&#39;ve killed, people who I’ve lost. 

//[Silence.]//

**Zimmerman:** We’re fighting for something greater. That’s what they tell you. Never helped me none. 

**SCP-4793:** //[Quietly.]// Nobody here died for a reason.

**Zimmerman:** And Hargraves&#39;ll rot in Hell for it.

//[The sound of twisting metal can be heard. Zimmerman pivots to look at SCP-4793. The metal bar used to push the trolley is bent severely.]//

**Zimmerman:** Hey. Don&#39;t lose your soul. //[Cough.]// You&#39;re a good man, Androcles. Maybe under different circumstances, we&#39;d be friends.

**SCP-4793:** Maybe if I manage to get out of here, we could be.

//[Zimmerman turns back. The freight elevator doors are open and an X06 with red markings is sniffing around in the inside. Zimmerman levels his handgun, but SCP-4793 pushes it down with a hand.]//

**Zimmerman:** What?

**SCP-4793:** He&#39;s not gonna hurt you.

**Zimmerman:** But-

**SCP-4793:** I don&#39;t know how to explain it. //[SCP-4793 lets out a short whistle.]// But let&#39;s get you on that lift.

//[The X06 walks over to SCP-4793 as they push the cart into the elevator.]//  

**Zimmerman:** Is there anything I can...?

**SCP-4793:** Um... yeah. Do the body cam batteries look like  //[Gestures with their hands.]//

//[Zimmerman leans over and removes the battery from McCalloway&#39;s body camera.]//

**Zimmerman:** One size fits all. //[Cough.]// Good luck out there. 

**SCP-4793:** If I don&#39;t... come back. Take care of Holly. And don&#39;t let anyone come in here. 

**Zimmerman:** What do you mean?

**SCP-4793:** I have to do this. At any cost.

**SCP-4793:** And... there we go! Hey, look at that, Argos! I think it&#39;s recording again.

//[Camera shows an upside-down empty hallway. The camera is suddenly flipped and moved side to side. SCP-4793 moves their hand back and forth in front of the camera. Looking to the side, the view changes to an X06 with red markings[[footnote]]Designated X06-A[[/footnote]]. It sticks its tongue out and flaps its wings briefly.]//

**SCP-4793:** Hello. Whoever finds this. My name is Androcles. Or SCP-4793. This is Argos. He&#39;s... are you a ... Nevermind, Argos is a friendly X06. I don&#39;t know why, every single one up till now has tried to kill me, but he just... trotted over to me with this helmet. Snapped me out of my...

//[SCP-4793 goes silent.]//

**SCP-4793:** We&#39;re on floor twenty-four. One below this, then two maintenance floors and then the reactor. 

//[SCP-4793 begins walking towards a staircase. Entering the stairwell, he begins to descend the stairs.]//

**SCP-4793:** //[Muttering.]// Nobody here needed to die. There was no justice, not glory. Just...

//[SCP-4793 exits the stairwell. The hallway is filled with the bodies of researchers, as well as several X06s, who scatter after seeing them.]//

**SCP-4793:** Huh... That&#39;s... Nevermind. Let&#39;s go, Argos.

//[SCP-4793 begins walking towards a lab with the door ajar. Looking in, a broken security camera is lying on top of a set of monitors and a ventilation shaft lays on the floor. They keep walking.]//

**SCP-4793:** This place looks beat up. 

//[SCP-4793 looks down to see a security officer with several grenades laid out around them.]//

**SCP-4793:** Oh.

//[X06-A runs into a lab and stops in front of a table. SCP-4793 enters and looks at the table where X06-A stopped. There are several large black spheres lying in an incubator. In a separate incubator, the remains of a red sphere lie. SCP-4793 picks one up and examines it.]//

**SCP-4793:** Is this your...?

**X06-A:** Egg!

//[SCP-4793 looks at the label on the incubator. In small handwriting, it reads, &#34;Blood Sample: 4793 | Purity: 100%&#34;.]//

**SCP-4793:** My blood? Wait, is that...? //[Pause.]// The visits to the medical wing. It was...

//[SCP-4793 continues to look around the labs for several minutes before the sound of scratching can be heard. They turn and head towards the source. A minute later, they come across an X06 scratching at a pile of rubble. SCP-4793 bangs their sword against their shield and it runs off down a side passage.]// 

**Unknown Voice:** Hello? Is... somebody there? I&#39;m behind this pile. My legs... I think they&#39;re broken. Please.

**SCP-4793:** Hold on, I&#39;ll dig you out!

//[SCP-4793 begins moving the steel and concrete chunks with their hands. Grabbing an I-Beam, they prop up the collapsing ceiling and move the final pieces out of the way.]//

**SCP-4793:** You...

**Director Hargraves:** Oh thank God. Androcles, you came to save me.

**SCP-4793:** I&#39;m not here for you.

**Director Hargraves:** What else could you possibly be doing down here?

**SCP-4793:** Walking to my death. Watching my friends get hurt. Die. Losing pieces of my soul. 

**Director Hargraves:** And what? This kind of thing happens. We just rebuild. 

**SCP-4793:** It&#39;s. All. Your. Fault. 

**Director Hargraves:** For the greater g-

**SCP-4793:** Shut up. Nobody here died for any reason other than your arrogance!

//[Director Hargraves stiffens and props himself up on his elbows.]//

**Director Hargraves:** You&#39;re angry, aren&#39;t you?

**SCP-4793:** Unimaginably.

//[Director Hargraves laughs.]//

**Director Hargaves:** I&#39;m already a dead man. Just finish the job.

**SCP-4793:** What do you-

**Director Hargraves:** I see that blood. The notched blade. All those brand new scars.  If you&#39;re going to kill me, don&#39;t wait. I was right about you all along, wasn&#39;t I //[Runs his hand through his hair and laughs.]//  Go ahead, prove me right. You- you&#39;re a killer. You loved every second of it. Like a perfect killer. You just need motivation.

//[SCP-4793 is silent.]//

**Director Hargraves:** I saw you cried when we pulled you out of that cave. Was that the first time? Tears of joy? Glad to finally hurt somebody again. //[Pause.]// Did you even cry when Arabel died?

//[The tip of SCP-4793&#39;s blade begins to shake and Director Hargraves lets out a harsh laugh.]//

**Director Hargraves:** What? Did your precious Holly die too? 

//[SCP-4793 lunges towards Director Hargraves, but stops short.]//

**Director Hargraves:** Oh? So you truly are a coward, deep down.

**SCP-4793:** You aren&#39;t worth it. Killing you won&#39;t bring anyone back.

//[SCP-4793 reaches in, grabs Director Hargraves by the collar of his lab coat, and begins pulling him away from the rubble.]//

**Director Hargraves:** Wait. What are you?

**SCP-4793:** And letting you die down here would be the same as killing you myself.  

//[SCP-4793 drags Director Hargraves to the freight elevator and lets him go. They swipe a keycard and the machine begins to whir. Pulling a knife from their belt, they toss it to Hargraves.]//

**SCP-4793:** Use this to defend yourself against your pets. 

//[They turn and walk away.]//

**Director Hargraves:** Wait you can&#39;t... just leave me. If the Foundation finds out I&#39;m responsible...

**SCP-4793:** Then use the knife to kill yourself. Your life is in your own hands.

//[Five minutes pass. After turning a corner, the camera shows X06-A scratching at a door. SCP-4793 starts jogging towards it.]//

**SCP-4793:** What is it, Argos?

//[SCP-4793 grabs the doorknob. It doesn&#39;t turn, so they punch it through the door. X06-A pushes through the door and enunciates a short phrase.]// 

**X06-A:** Here... to... help!

**SCP-4793:** Hey! Good job, Argos.

**Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Andr... Androcles?

//[SCP-4793 looks into the corner of the room.]//

**SCP-4793:** Dr. Fitz-Patrick? Are you?

//[Pushing the door open, the light reveals two Junior Researchers and two Doctors hiding in the back of the closet.]//

**Junior Researcher 1:** How did you find us?

**Dr. Alexandra Virgil:** Fuck, it&#39;s another one of those things.

//[Dr. Virgil pulls out a handgun.]//

**SCP-4793:** Woah! This is Argos. He&#39;s with me. Actually the reason I found you.

//[The survivors get up and start to walk towards SCP-4793.]//

**Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Oh my god, you&#39;re covered in blood.

**SCP-4793:** //[Short laugh.]// Yeah. But we gotta move. The elevator should be here any second. And Hargraves won&#39;t wait

//[Dr. Fitz-Patrick&#39;s eyes narrow.]//

**Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** He survived?

//[SCP-4793 begins to move towards the elevator.]//

**SCP-4793:** He wasn&#39;t worth it. 

//[The group walks in silence, reaching the elevator. Director Hargraves looks up at them.]//

**Director Hargraves:** Oh Eleanor! You survived! 

//[Doctor Fitz-Patrick kicks out, striking him in the head and knocking him to the ground.]// 

**Dr Fitz-Patrick:** The Overseers sent me here to watch your pompous ass, and by God, you will answer for this. Every single death.

**Director Hargraves:** It was... for the...

//[Doctor Virgil kicks him in the head.]//

**Dr. Virgil:** Fuck off. 

//[The doors open and the Junior Researchers drag the unconscious director into the elevator, followed by the doctors. Dr. Fitz-Patrick looks back at SCP-4793.]//

**Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Are you...

**SCP-4793:** I&#39;m not coming. I&#39;ve gotta finish this. Somehow.

//[Dr. Fitz-Patrick steps out and embraces SCP-4793.]//

**SCP-4793:** Could you... //[Removes helmet.]// Take this with you? There&#39;s a message on it.

**Dr. Fitz-Patrick:** Of course. For Captain Shore?

**SCP-4793:** Yes. //[Pause.]// For Holly.

**SCP-4793:** Hi, Holiday. Can you do a sweep for life signs?

//[The room is filled with large clusters of black spheres and on top of the reactor sits a massive X06[[footnote]]Designated X06-3[[/footnote]]. It is covered in a scaly armor and has short legs and arm. As SCP-4793 enters, it slithers down and stands before them, its head brushing against the fifteen meter tall ceiling.]//

**X06-3:** Welcome, Androcles.

**SCP-4793:** How... do you know my name?

**X06-3:** My father spoke of you often. You did him such a kindness.

**SCP-4793:** Your fathe... Hargraves.

**X06-3:** Did you know there&#39;s another Androcles. A Roman, but I digress. He plucked the thorn out of a lion&#39;s paw. Years later, when he was thrown into the arena by a cruel Caesar, the lion recognized him and spared his life.  

**SCP-4793:** Why are you telling me this?

//[X06-3 laughs.]//

**X06-3:** I am the lion. You saved my father, so I will grant you this boon: Leave now, and none of us will harm you. I know you have a loved one up above.

**SCP-4793:** What, so you can kill everyone?

**X06-3:** Kill? My short-sighted brother, we don&#39;t wish to kill anyone. As our father proclaimed, we will roam the Earth, seeking and capturing the anomalous. 

**SCP-4793:** What about everyone here? I&#39;ve walked through a graveyard to get to you.

**X06-3:** A necessary evil.

**SCP-4793:** How could you possibly justify this?

**X06-3:** We need numbers. The forces arrayed against us? Too many for one or two or a dozen of us to take alone.

**SCP-4793:** So you just killed with abandon? 

**X06-3:** No death here brought us joy. But every man and woman in this building swore they would lay down their lives to protect the world.

**SCP-4793:** So you made the choice for them?

**X06-3:** They will live on as martyrs. Heroes who died to bring the world safety.

//[Silence.]//

**SCP-4793:** Why did you call me &#39;brother&#39;?

**X06-3:** Our father used your blood to create us. It holds the power that allows us to multiply with such ease, to grow as fast as we do. We are brothers in everything but name.

//[Silence.]//

**SCP-4793:** I can&#39;t let you leave here. Not after seeing this. 

**X06-3:** How will you stop me? By sacrificing yourself? By losing yourself bit by bit as you track us all down? 

//[SCP-4793 punches the wall and removes a section of rebar with a piece of concrete at the end. It transforms into a concrete greatsword.]//

**SCP-4793:** I know who I am. I am Androcles. Beloved of Ares. Warrior of Greece. //[Pause.]// But I am also Androcles, the Protector, and Friend. 

//[X06-A growls at X06-3.]//

**SCP-4793:** I know who I am, and nothing will change this. //[Takes a step towards X06-3.]//

**X06-3:** What are you doing?

__**Addendum -19**__
[[&lt;]]
On December 28th, 2018, the central facility of Site-20 was destroyed in a nuclear explosion of unknown magnitude. All surviving personnel were treated for their injuries and transferred to Site-12, a facility in Central Pennsylvania, while Site-20 undergoes reconstruction. Despite the loss of structural integrity in the building, 737 of the 782 items contained at Site-20 were recovered. No X06 entities were discovered during this sweep. 

In the reactor level, the hypothesized origin of the blast, portions of X06-3 were found. No trace of SCP-4793 or X06-A was discovered. Using controlled explosives, the remaining above-ground structure was collapsed and the pit was filled with concrete.


[!-- The reactor in Site-20 was found to be intact and functional, with almost no radiation recorded anywhere in the structure. However, everything above the maintenance floors was destroyed, with evidence to suggest the blast came from above the Site. The source of this blast is unknown and efforts to discover the cause are ongoing. --]

[!-- All personnel with Level 4 clearance are to perpetuate the idea that Site-20 was destroyed by a nuclear explosion. --]

[!-- Update: SCP-4793 is the incarnation of the Greek God Ares and the explosion at Site-20 is regarded as a Class IV Ascension Event. --]

[!-- Update: SCP-4793 and X06-A have been located and the basement levels of Site-20 have been retrofitted as holding cells for the foreseeable future. --]

//[Camera opens to SCP-4793 sitting against a wall, their sword and shield sitting to the side.]//

**SCP-4793:** Hey Holly. I hope this message gets to you. Somehow. It&#39;s been about two hours since I last saw you. I hope it isn&#39;t the last...

//[SCP-4793 smiles weakly.]//

**SCP-4793:** I... don&#39;t know what to say. So much to say, so little time. 

//[SCP-4793 coughs.]//

**SCP-4793:** I was born to a farmer and grew into a warrior. I battled Ares to a standstill. I won wars singlehandedly. Then I met my wife. We were set to claim the world, two immortals who wanted to bring a chaotic world some semblance of peace. And then Ares killed her. And I lost everything.

//[Pause.]//

**SCP-4793:** And now I&#39;m here. Alone. Adrift. A stranger surrounded by even stranger things. But within you, I see the spark I saw in her. A burning desire to make the world better. It makes me want to be better. And I don&#39;t know if you feel the same, or whether I&#39;ll get out of here...

//[SCP-4793 touches their eye.]// 

**SCP-4793:** But I will fight for you. Die if I have to.
