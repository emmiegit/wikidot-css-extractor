Dr. Edison sneezed into the telephone. It had been a long day keeping the eldritch horrors contained within Site-██ locked up, and the good doctor was in no mood to catch a cold. The fact that Site-██ was in Antarctica didn&#39;t help things. &#34;Sorry doc.&#34; he said. &#34;I don&#39;t think I caught that. You&#39;re saying my what went where now?&#34;

&#34;Your movie! [[[scp-foundation-the-movie|The one that got you transferred to Antarctica]]]!&#34; said Dr. King. &#34;It&#39;s becoming a cult classic! The O5 are in an uproar! Haven&#39;t you been paying attention?&#34;

&#34;Attention?&#34; Edison replied. &#34;Attention to what?&#34;

------
&gt; //And now it&#39;s time for Bum Reviews, with Chester A. Bum.//
&gt; //Tonight&#39;s review: The SCP Foundation//
&gt;  
&gt; OHHHH MY GOD, THIS IS THE GREATEST MOVIE I&#39;VE EVER SEEN IN MY **LIFE!**
&gt; 
&gt; [DATA EX**SPOILERS!**]
&gt; 
&gt; So there are these guys, called the SCP Foundation, and they&#39;re this secret government organization run by Tommy Wissau dedicated to investigating paranormal stuff!
&gt; 
&gt; **I** WAS A PARANORMAL INVESTIGATOR, ONCE!
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, wait, that was just a TV show. What was it called again? Oh yeah: //Baywatch Nights!// 
&gt; 
&gt; But there&#39;s also this organization of //eeeevil// terrorists who kidnap a vampire overlord... who is played by the guy from Twilight for some reason.
&gt; 
&gt; Boy, that Edward guy has fallen on hard times, hasn&#39;t he?
&gt; 
&gt; But to make matters worse, there&#39;s an //eeevil// arms dealer working for the terrorists, who wants to destroy the SCP foundation so that he can... drill for oil, or something. 
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, I don&#39;t get it either.
&gt; 
&gt; So Tommy Wisau calls his top scientists, and tells them that they need to stop the terrorists before the vampire Apocalypse happens!
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Uh, boss? Wouldn&#39;t it be a better idea to just tell the army about this or something?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Ha ha ha funny story, Mark.&#34;

&gt; **PHELOUS:** So that was The SCP Foundation, another disappointingly shitty movie from &#34;Zhe Only Fucking Geinus in Zhe Buisness&#34; and those guys who made Epic Movie. Oh, and in case you&#39;re one of those people who just watch the end of videos without any context, I&#39;m Phelous the Canadian internet review guy from ThatGuyWithTheGlasses dot com dot com. 
&gt; 
&gt; **PHELOUS:** OOOOOOOOOHHHH! Do you see what I just did there? I just made fun of something really stupid that the movie did in my end-of-review skit that they thought was funny but really wasn&#39;t! I am being //soooo// funny right now!
&gt; 
&gt; **PHELOUS:** OOOOOOOOOHHHH! I just explained the joke that I just made five seconds ago, which is ALSO something the movie did that I&#39;m making fun of! More comic //goooolllld!//
&gt; 
&gt; //*&#34;Dr Clef&#34; (obviously played by Phelous in a suit and gorilla mask) walks into the room brandishing a Ukalale-Shotgun.*//
&gt; 
&gt; **&#34;DR. CLEF&#34;:** You&#39;ve made terrible meta-jokes for the last time, Phelous. I&#39;m here to take away your Internet licence forever!
&gt; 
&gt; **PHELOUS:** Noooooo! How could this happen to meeeeeeee? //*Breaks into song*// I made my mistakeeeessss! There&#39;s nowhere to ruuuun, the night goes ooooooon and I&#39;m fading awaaaaayyyyyy!
&gt; 
&gt; //*Dr. Clef shoots Phelous. Phelous begins regenerating time-lord style for about 10 seconds while Dramatic Dr. Who music plays, only to stop abruptly.*//
&gt; 
&gt; **PHELOUS:** Ha ha, I&#39;m not doing that joke anymore. In fact, this entire skit is kind of terrible isn&#39;t it, so lets end it right here.
&gt; 
&gt; **&#34;DR. CLEF&#34;:** What? You mean I came all this way for nothing?
&gt; 
&gt; **PHELOUS:** Fiiiiine. You can do a one-liner... but just one!
&gt; 
&gt; **&#34;DR. CLEF&#34;:** Okay then. Ahem: //*Dr. Who music begins playing again*// Get these motherfucking Skips off my motherfucking plane... motherfucker!
&gt;
&gt; *Music suddenly stops.*
&gt; 
&gt; **PHELOUS:** Really? That&#39;s the best you could come up with?
&gt; 
&gt; **&#34;DR. CLEF&#34;:** Oh shut up, it&#39;s not like your show is much better.
&gt; 
&gt; **PHELOUS:** Ha ha, you see that was funny beacuse my show has terrible production values, so by saying that my show isn&#39;t much better than that terrible one liner Clef is making a humorous comparison to-
&gt; 
&gt; //*Dr. Clef shoots Phelous*//
&gt; 
&gt; **PHELOUS:** *cough* *hak*, Mmmm, watcha saaaayyyy...
&gt; 
&gt; //*Dr. Clef shoots Phelous again. Cue credits.*//

&#34;Well given that I got transferred to freakin&#39; Antarctica, I&#39;m not exactly first in line to learn this kind of stuff.&#34; Dr. Edison coughed. &#34;So, um... what do you want me to do about it?&#34;

&#34;The hell if I know!&#34; Dr. King said. &#34;It&#39;s your movie! You do something about it!&#34;

Dr. Edison paused as he gave the problem some thought. &#34;Okay.&#34; he said, &#34;Here&#39;s what you do...&#34;

------

&gt; **FILM BRAIN:** I&#39;m Film Brain, and welcome to Bad Movie Beatdown! Today we&#39;re going to take a look at Michael Bay&#39;s __SCP Foundation 6: The Revenge of Darkblade__, undoubtedly the worst movie of our generation. It&#39;s so bad that it has the dubious honor of being the //only// movie to somehow wind up with a //negative// Metacritic score. And believe me, this movie deserves it.
&gt; 
&gt; *Cut to Phelous, wearing the Dr Clef costume*
&gt; 
&gt; **PHELOUS:** Not so fast, Film Brain! Your data is about to be //Ex-Punged//!
&gt;  
&gt; **FILM BRAIN:** No, Phelous, I am not doing //another// crossover with you.
&gt; 
&gt; **PHELOUS:** Oh come on! But I brought out the costume and every-
&gt; 
&gt; **FILM BRAIN:** NO.
&gt; 
&gt; *Phelous slinks away, while a violin plays in the background*

------

&#34;I don&#39;t understand...&#34; said O5-█. &#34;How exactly does making more movies solve the problem?&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s quite simple, really.&#34; said Dr. Edison, adjusting his sunglasses. &#34;With a few exceptions, movies only get worse and worse as more sequels keep being made. So I figured that if we make enough sequels, we&#39;ll eventually make a movie so bad that it will erase the entire franchise from the collective unconscious! And who else is better at making terrible sequels than Michael Bay himself?&#34;

O5-█ shook his head. &#34;I can think of so many reasons why that didn&#39;t work.&#34;

&#34;Yeah, I don&#39;t know what I was thinking either.&#34; said Dr. Edison. &#34;In fact, I think I actually made things worse... But you have to admit, they work great as torture devices!&#34;

The O5 glared at Edison.

&#34;I&#39;m being sent back to Antarctica, aren&#39;t I?&#34;

&#34;Yep.&#34;</textarea></pre>
