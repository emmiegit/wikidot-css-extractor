**Item №:** SCP-6532

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-6532 are to be contained within the Parazoology Habitat at Site-204. 

Any reports that indicate an uncontained SCP-6532 instance are to be investigated. Upon the confirmation of an uncontained SCP-6532 instance, Foundation agents are to be dispatched to the area to retrieve the SCP-6532 instance. Any witnesses are to be treated with amnestics.

Due to the limited amount of SCP-6532 instances, dissection for further examination is currently prohibited.

**Description:** SCP-6532 is the collective designation for 17 sentient human organs capable of independent movement.

SCP-6532 instances possess multiple humanoid limbs with sharp claws, which are used for ambulation. Furthermore, SCP-6532 instances also possess structures that resemble miniature human eyes on their surface, presumably for navigation. All SCP-6532 instances have large orifices resembling a human&#39;s mouth on their surface which produce and contain human blood. Blood analysis reveals significantly higher genetic markers for hereditary diseases compared to the baseline human genome.

Periodically, new instances of SCP-6532 are recovered from North Holland, Netherlands, engaging in various behaviors. Most SCP-6532 instances are docile and will not attempt to resist containment; noncompliant instances will attempt to breach containment by attacking personnel with their claws. [[footnote]] Due to their lack of strength, all escape attempts are unsuccessful.[[/footnote]] SCP-6532 instances do not appear to require any sustenance, as instances are never observed to feed. SCP-6532 instances are also highly resistant to bacterial infections and do not undergo decay.

Notably, imaging tests revealed that most SCP-6532 instances are affected with various diseases, such as cancer. The origins of SCP-6532 instances are currently undergoing investigation.

**Addendum | Abridged List of SCP-6532 instances:**

For the full list, please consult Head Researcher Cornelia Koopman.

&gt; **Instance №:** SCP-6532-1
&gt; 
&gt; **Date of Recovery:** 9th August 2018
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** A brain possessing 6 limbs. Imaging test revealed SCP-6532-1 is affected by Alzheimer&#39;s.
&gt; 
&gt; **Recorded behavior:** SCP-6532-1 was found wandering around on a beach, ignoring all bystanders around it. Instance was discovered following reports of &#34;a brain with legs watching the sunset&#34; in the area. Instance did not resist containment.
&gt; 

&gt; **Instance №:** SCP-6532-3
&gt; 
&gt; **Date of Recovery:** 18th January 2019
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** A human leg, with an additional 2 limbs growing from the calf. Imaging test revealed SCP-6532-3 is affected by gangrene.
&gt; 
&gt; **Recorded behavior:** SCP-6532-3 was recovered on a sidewalk along with a plastic bowl, witness reporting that SCP-6532-3 attempted to beg for what is assumed to be money. It had not succeeded in obtaining anything. A pamphlet could be found along with SCP-6532-3 during recovery, which appears to depict a prosthetic leg and money drawn with pen ink. Instance resisted containment, attacking personnel with its limbs and attempting to squeeze through tight spaces. All attempts ended in failure.

&gt; **Instance №:** SCP-6532-6
&gt;  
&gt; **Date of Recovery:** 3rd September 2020
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** A pair of lungs, possessing 4 limbs and a single orifice on each side. Imaging test revealed that SCP-6532-6 is affected by cancer.
&gt; 
&gt; **Recorded behavior:** SCP-6532-6 was recovered after a report of a pair of lungs breaking into a tobacco store. SCP-6532-6 reportedly damaged the store by knocking over tobacco products over the shelves before spitting liquid all over the dropped items. It then proceeded to attack the manager of the store by pulling his leg and tripping him, before spitting blood on his hair via the orifice and fleeing the scene. Instance was then found wandering in a nearby street. During retrieval, SCP-6532-6 resisted containment, defending itself with the same method used to attack the store manager. SCP-6532-6 appears to contain 2 different consciousness within each lung and are sometimes observed to have conflicting movement.

&gt; **Instance №:** SCP-6532-8 to SCP-6532-10
&gt; 
&gt; **Date of Recovery:** 2nd March 2021
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** All 3 SCP-6532 instances are square pieces of human skin (consisting of the epidermis and dermis layer) of various sizes possessing 4 limbs. Imaging test revealed their structure is similar to a patch of skin affected by cancer.
&gt; 
&gt; **Recovery &amp; recorded behavior:** All 3 SCP-6532 instances were found wandering on a beach, carrying a large garbage bag containing various discarded waste such as rags, paper and wooden debris, attempting to construct a structure resembling an umbrella using aforementioned discarded waste beside a civilian who was sunbathing at that time. After constructing the &#34;umbrella&#34;, the 3 SCP-6532 instances gestured nearby civilians to approach the umbrella and attempted to give them bottles of sunscreen.
&gt; 
&gt; During containment, SCP-6532-9 was observed to communicate with SCP-6532-8 and SCP-6532-10. It is currently hypothesized that SCP-6532-9 is attempting to convince SCP-6532-8 and SCP-6532-10 to escape containment, as it constantly points outside the containment zone with its limbs. Currently, SCP-6532-8 and SCP-6532-10 appear to be unconvinced by SCP-6532-9.

&gt; **Instance №:** SCP-6532-14
&gt; 
&gt; **Date of Recovery:** 1st January 2022
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** A heart with 6 limbs. Imaging test revealed SCP-6532-14 is affected by coronary artery disease.
&gt; 
&gt; **Recorded behavior:** SCP-6532-14 was recovered after a report of a citizen (Aldert Citroen) attacked by SCP-6532-14. According to the citizen, SCP-6532-14 attempted to slice his skin under his collarbone during his sleep, waking him up in the process. This startled Citroen, causing him to retaliate. Additionally, SCP-6532-14 was also reported to hold a device made from electronic waste.
&gt; 
&gt; During containment, SCP-6532-14 was recorded to be much inactive and docile compared to the other SCP-6532 instances. A few days after the incident, Citroen was diagnosed with coronary artery disease as well as arrhythmia. Due to the similarities of SCP-6532-14&#39;s &#34;attack&#34; towards Citroen to the pacemaker insertion process, it was hypothesized that the device held by SCP-6532-14 is a makeshift pacemaker produced by itself.

&gt; **Instance №:** SCP-6532-17
&gt; 
&gt; **Date of Recovery:** 21st December 2023
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** A liver with a gallbladder and bile duct attached to it. The liver possesses 5 limbs. Imaging test revealed its structure is similar to liver affected by liver cirrhosis.
&gt; 
&gt; **Recorded behavior:** SCP-6532-17 was recovered at a park, witnesses reporting that SCP-6532-17 attempted to give out pamphlets made of discarded paper waste. The content of the pamphlets consist of unintelligible text scribbled across it, with illustration of what appears to depict alcoholic drinks and fast food crossed out. Analysis of the pamphlets indicates the text and illustrations were written using human bile and blood. One of the limb is located near the gallbladder, occasionally squeezing it to draw depictions similar with the pamphlets it gave out during discovery.
&gt; 
&gt; A janitor (Charlie Janssen) tasked in maintaining Site-204 Parazoology Habitat has reported that SCP-6532-17 will draw depictions similar in content to pamphlets it gave out during discovery on the floor using bile produced in the gallbladder attached to it. Additionally, SCP-6532-17 will often guide him to the drawings and will roll its eyes every time he cleaned up the drawings during cleaning routines. Interview conducted with Janssen reported that he had an increase of alcohol use over the last 4 months. After discussion with the Ethics Committee, Janssen has been assigned to visit the on-site psychiatrist weekly to help him with alcohol abuse.
