**Item #:** SCP-7218

**Object Class:** Euclid

**NOTICE:**
//It is unknown if the area of effect of SCP-7218 is growing, as the area surrounding SCP-7218 has been showing the same anomalous properties as the contained area.//

**Special Containment Procedures:** 
SCP-7218 is to be contained within a fenced perimeter, separating it from the surrounding forest. The perimeter should be equipped with motion sensors and monitored by security personnel. Unauthorized access is to be prevented, and civilians or staff found within the area who lack Level 3 clearance or higher are to be administered Class A amnestics.

Instances of SCP-7218-A are to be studied for resemblance to deceased humans. If no resemblance is found, instances are to be incinerated to prevent potential attacks. In case of an attack, non-lethal measures should be employed initially. Mobile Task Force Gamma-4 is to be deployed to terminate all instances of SCP-7218-A, regardless of their appearance.

Personnel assigned to SCP-7218 are to be timed during their stay within the area. Any personnel remaining in the area for over two hours must be immediately removed and undergo a psychological evaluation.

All instances of SCP-7218-A that resemble deceased humans are to be housed in standard humanoid containment cells and provided with appropriate amenities. If any instances are deemed capable of reintegrating into society, they are to be administered Class A amnestics.

**Description:** 
SCP-7218 is a wooded area measuring 500 m x 750 m located in Colorado. Individuals who remain within SCP-7218 for more than two hours will become unresponsive to all external stimuli, before being consumed by various small animals, including sciurus carolinensisor (Eastern Gray Squirrel), odocoileus virginianus (White-tailed Deer), and cervus canadensis nelsoni (Rocky Mountain Elk). The remains of these individuals cannot be located or traced.

The flora located inside SCP-7218 has not been attributed to any other known flora. DNA from the plants have shown resemblance to most common plants of the region, but are not a perfect match. It is unknown what has caused the plant life to change from the surrounding forest.

SCP-7218-A instances sporadically manifest when not directly observed. Attempts to view or record SCP-7218-A instances during manifestation have proven unsuccessful. These instances can take the form of small or large animals, humanoid beings, or clones of recently deceased individuals who have died within SCP-7218.

**Addendum 7218-1: Incident Report 7218-Alpha** 

On [REDACTED], a breach incident occurred within SCP-7218, resulting in the manifestation of an unusually high number of SCP-7218-A instances. The incident was initiated by an unexplained power surge that temporarily disabled the motion sensors and caused a brief loss of communication with security personnel.

Upon investigation, it was discovered that several instances of SCP-7218-A had breached containment and infiltrated Site-[REDACTED], leading to multiple casualties among the staff. MTF Gamma-4 was immediately dispatched to neutralize the instances and restore containment.

During the containment breach, it was observed that the SCP-7218-A instances exhibited heightened aggression and demonstrated a coordinated effort to evade capture. They displayed an increased resistance to standard tranquilizer darts, necessitating the use of lethal force in certain instances.

Following the incident, an analysis of the breach revealed a potential link between the power surge and an underground network of roots extending from SCP-7218. Further investigation is underway to determine the nature and capabilities of this root network, as well as its involvement in the breach.

As a result of Incident 7218-Alpha, additional security measures have been implemented, including reinforced fencing, redundant power systems, and enhanced surveillance. The research team is also exploring methods to disrupt or contain the underground root network to prevent future breaches.

**Addendum 7218-2: Test Log 7218-1 &amp; 7218-2**

//Test Log 7218-1//

//Procedure://
A D-Class personnel (D-7843) is equipped with a body camera and instructed to enter SCP-7218 for observation and time measurement. The D-Class personnel is to exit SCP-7218 after exactly two hours.

//Results://
Upon entering SCP-7218, D-7843 exhibits signs of distress and panic after approximately 30 minutes. As the observation continues, D-7843&#39;s vital signs become increasingly erratic. At the two-hour mark, D-7843 collapses and becomes unresponsive. Despite immediate extraction, D-7843 cannot be revived, and the remains exhibit signs of rapid decomposition.

//Analysis://
The test confirms that prolonged exposure to SCP-7218 leads to the rapid demise of individuals within the designated time frame. The cause of death and accelerated decomposition require further investigation.

//Test Log 7218-2//

//Procedure://
An unmanned aerial drone equipped with infrared and thermal imaging cameras is deployed to observe SCP-7218 from a safe distance outside the perimeter.

//Results://
The drone captures footage of several instances of SCP-7218-A manifesting within SCP-7218. The thermal imaging reveals unusual heat signatures in the area corresponding to the appearances and disappearances of SCP-7218-A instances. Notably, the heat signatures do not match the appearances of any known animal species, suggesting anomalous properties associated with the manifestations.

//Analysis://
The thermal imaging confirms the anomalous nature of SCP-7218-A instances and provides evidence of their distinct heat signatures during manifestation. This further supports the need for enhanced containment measures.

**Addendum 7218-3: Containment Procedure Update**

Based on the test results and ongoing analysis, the following updates have been made to the containment procedures for SCP-7218:

* 		The perimeter fencing surrounding SCP-7218 is to be reinforced with an additional layer of reinforced steel mesh to deter unauthorized access and potential breaches.
* 		Infrared and thermal surveillance cameras are to be installed around the perimeter to monitor any anomalous heat signatures associated with SCP-7218-A manifestations. The surveillance footage should be reviewed regularly for further analysis.
* 		Mobile Task Force Gamma-4 is to undergo specialized training in dealing with SCP-7218-A instances, including techniques to subdue and contain instances without resorting to lethal force, if possible.
* 		Research teams are to intensify efforts to study the underground root network associated with SCP-7218. A thorough analysis of the network&#39;s properties and potential vulnerabilities is necessary to prevent future breaches.

**Addendum 7218-4: Site &amp; Researcher Assignment**

Following the ongoing investigation and containment updates related to SCP-7218, Site-19 has been designated as the primary site responsible for the research for continuous containment of SCP-7218.

Dr. Samantha Williams, a senior researcher with expertise in anomalous environmental phenomena and biohazard containment, has been assigned as the lead researcher for SCP-7218 at Site-19. Dr. Williams has previously conducted extensive research on other botanical anomalies and has demonstrated exceptional understanding in the field of anomalous ecology.

Dr. Williams will oversee all research endeavors, including further analysis of SCP-7218-A manifestations, the underground root network, and the development of specialized containment protocols. Collaboration with other researchers and MTF Gamma-4 will be encouraged to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of SCP-7218 and ensure effective containment measures.

Regular progress reports and any significant findings or breakthroughs will be submitted to the Site Director and the Ethics Committee for review and implementation of necessary updates to the containment procedures.

**Addendum 7218-5: Test Log 7218-3 &amp; SCP-7218-A Reiteration**

In light of the continued manifestations of SCP-7218-A instances, further analysis and categorization have been conducted to provide a clearer understanding of their variations. The following is an updated reiteration of SCP-7218-A instances:
    	
SCP-7218-A: Designation given to instances resembling large quadrupedal creatures with elongated limbs and bioluminescent markings. Further study is necessary to determine their anatomical structure, behavior, and any potential danger they may pose.
    	
SCP-7218-B: Designation given to instances resembling humanoid entities with multiple pairs of translucent wings and luminescent patterns. These instances exhibit flight capabilities and appear to be non-threatening, but their purpose and relationship to SCP-7218 require further investigation.
    	
SCP-7218-C: Designation given to instances that closely resemble deceased individuals who have previously perished within SCP-7218. These instances display characteristics and memories consistent with their deceased counterparts. Research is ongoing to determine if these instances possess any residual consciousness or if they are merely imitations.

The new classifications have led to the need for a broad term for naming the manifestations, and has been given the term SCP-7218-R. Researchers and personnel are encouraged to report any further instances of SCP-7218-R manifestations promptly and provide detailed observations and documentation for further analysis.

//Test Log 7218-3//

//Procedure://
A Class D personnel (D-7690) is equipped with a high-resolution digital camera and instructed to remain within SCP-7218 for a period of two hours to document any manifestations of SCP-7218-R instances.

//Results://
During the observation period, D-7690 successfully captures photographic evidence of three distinct instances of SCP-7218-R manifestations. The instances include:
    	
SCP-7218-A-1: An instance resembling a large quadrupedal creature with elongated limbs and a series of bioluminescent markings along its body.
    	
SCP-7218-B-1: An instance resembling a humanoid entity with multiple pairs of translucent wings and luminescent patterns on its body. This instance exhibits flight capabilities and shows no signs of direct interaction with other instances or the environment.
    	
SCP-7218-C-1: An instance resembling a duplicate of a deceased individual previously documented within SCP-7218. The instance displays a detached and non-responsive demeanor, occasionally mimicking actions performed by the deceased individual before their demise.

//Analysis://
The photographic evidence confirms the existence and diversity of these instances, with each instance exhibiting unique characteristics and behaviors. Further research is required to understand the origins, purpose, and potential threat posed by these manifestations.
