**Item #:** SCP-4033

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4033 is currently held at Site-██ in a padlocked glass container. When handling the object, 0.5 centimetre rubber gloves are to be worn at all times. --No direct contact with SCP-4033 is permitted unless conducting a test.-- No more tests including SCP-4033 are to be conducted under order from the Site Director.

**Description:** SCP-4033 is a Cadbury&#39;s Crème Egg that cannot be cracked, melted, eaten or damaged in any other way. If a subject touches SCP-4033 through skin contact, the subject will hear a voice. No others have reported hearing the voice, hereby referred to as SCP-4033-1.

SCP-4033-1 has been reported to have a noticeable lisp and resembles a child&#39;s TV show mascot. When activated, SCP-4033-1 will say: &#39;//Hooray! You want to join in my Easter Egg hunt! I see you&#39;ve found the first one already, so hurry on! Time is of the essence!//&#39;

A painted egg will then appear somewhere in a ten-metre radius of the subject, often found in simple hiding places, such as on a shelf, or behind another object. If a subject collects this egg, another egg (hereby referred to as instances of SCP-4033-2) will appear under the same conditions of the first. If a subject other than the one that initiated the &#34;hunt&#34; touches an instance of SCP-4033-2 or SCP-4033 itself, it will burn their fingers, causing them to instinctively drop it. SCP-4033-1 will then say: &#39;//No! You&#39;re not part of this hunt! Put that down!//&#39;

There are twelve instances of SCP-4033-2 in one &#34;hunt&#34;, and subjects are allocated ten minutes to collect all of these instances in order to &#34;win&#34;. When the &#34;hunt&#34; is over, all collected instances of SCP-4033-2 will spontaneously disappear.

If the subject &#34;wins&#34; , SCP-4033-1 will say: &#39;//Yay! Yay! Yay! You found them all! That means you get the GRAND PRIZE!//&#39; The &#34;winning&#34; subject will then fall unconscious. Medical examination of these subjects reveals that their stomachs are anomalously filled with a substance very similar to Cadbury&#39;s chocolate. While all winners have become severely ill and reported extreme pain, none have died.

If the subject &#34;loses&#34;, SCP-4033-1 will say: &#39;//Oh no... You didn&#39;t get all the eggs. Oh well, don&#39;t worry! You get the runner-up prize!//&#39; The subject will then undergo severe brain trauma and physical distress, while still remaining conscious. They will retain basic motor functions and the ability to vocalise, but will die approximately 2 minutes later. Autopsies have revealed these subjects to have a [DATA EXPUNGED] in their brains. 

Only one full interview has been successfully carried out with SCP-4033-1; following Incident-4033-A, no more interviews are to be conducted.

**Discovery:** Local Agents situated in ██████, █████ were alerted to 3 mortalities in ██████ Hospital, all dead were found to have [EXPUNGED] in their brains. SCP-4033 was found in the house of a local artist, who was found in extreme distress. They were later found to have a substance resembling chocolate in their stomach. Agent ███ touched SCP-4033 and successfully completed the &#34;hunt&#34;. Foundation backup arrived on scene and retrieved the Agents and SCP-4033.

**Addendum 4033-A:** 

&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-4033-1
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** D-89667
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** D-89667 was ordered to memorise a list of three questions to ask SCP-4033-1.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; //D-89667 picks up SCP-4033 with his bare hands.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4033-1:** //Hooray! You want to join in my Easter Egg hunt! I see you&#39;ve found the first one already, so hurry on! Time is of the essence!//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-89667:** All right. What&#39;s your name?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4033-1:** //Wh-what? That&#39;s not important now, you&#39;ve gotta find the eggs!//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-89667:** No, I need to know. Seriously, what&#39;s your name?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4033-1:** //My name? Well, you already know! I&#39;m the Easter Bunny!// 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-89667:** No, your //real// name. Like, Bob or something.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4033-1:** //Easter bunny. That... is... my real... name. Right? Yeah... Yeah...// 
&gt; 
&gt;  **D-89667:** Okay, I&#39;ll come back to that. What was the second question...  Where are you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4033-1:** //Where am I? Why, I&#39;m right behind... you.//
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-4033-1&#39;s voice becomes noticeably gruffer, its lisp is gone.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4033-1:** Hey, where the hell am I?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-89667:** Yeah, that&#39;s what //I// want to know!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4033-1:** It-it was you. You did this to me. I //know it.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-89667:** Hey, no, I didn&#39;t do it! 
&gt; 
&gt; //D-89667 starts to visibly panic.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4033-1:** I know you did...
&gt; 
&gt; **D-89667:** No! No! I know what happens to fucking D-class like me! //Don&#39;t kill me!//
&gt; 
&gt;  **SCP-4033-1:** You... did it.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-89667:** No! I didn&#39;t! Don&#39;t do it! //Please!//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4033-1:** Get the eggs. That&#39;s what you do. You bastard...
&gt; 
&gt; **D-89667:** Okay! Yes! Jesus.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4033-1:** Why... I&#39;m Easter... Hop, hop, hop.
&gt; 
&gt; //D-89667 collects all instances of SCP-4033-2 and subsequently falls unconscious.//
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End log&gt;** 
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** D-89667 was later reprimanded for failure to carry out his orders.

**Incident 4033-A:** 

&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-4033-1
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** D-89668
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** Shortly after the initial interview, an attempt to further establish the origins of SCP-4033-1 and its physical state was made. D-89668 was ordered to memorise a list of three questions to ask it.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin log&gt;**
&gt;
&gt; //D-89668 picks up SCP-4033 with his bare hands.// 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4033-1:** No...
&gt; 
&gt; **D-89668:** What is your name? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4033-1:** No... I have no name.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-89668:** Just tell me your name. I know you have one. Please make this easy for me.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4033-1:** You took it from me... and put me here.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-89668:** Well, no I didn&#39;t, but on that note, where are you?
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-4033-1 does not respond for 2 minutes.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4033-1:** Put me here and left me.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-89668:** Wait, what did you say? &#34;Put me and left&#34;?
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-4033-1 does not respond for 2 minutes.//
&gt; 
&gt;  **D-89668:** Are you still there?
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-4033-1 does not respond for a further minute.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-89668:** Hello? SCP-4033-1?
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-4033-1 does not respond for 2 minutes.// 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4033-1:** You want to know? The truth is, I don&#39;t know... I&#39;m the Easter Bunny... I  got nowhere to hop to. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-89668:** You don&#39;t-
&gt; 
&gt; //The allocated ten minutes to complete the &#34;hunt&#34; expires, and D-89668 falls to the floor in extreme distress. Agents watching over the test drag him away.//
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** D-89668 died two minutes after. An autopsy on him revealed that he had a [EXPUNGED] in his brain.
