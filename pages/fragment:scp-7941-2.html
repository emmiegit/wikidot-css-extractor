&gt; **D-81840 (M):** Okay, Doc, I haven&#39;t heard from you for a while, so I&#39;m gonna assume your shift is up or something. But since you&#39;re recording this, I&#39;m gonna try to lay out the situation insofar as I see it, 1. to prove I&#39;m still putting in the effort, 2. to fill in some of the blanks for you guys since you&#39;re only hearing what&#39;s going on rather than seeing it, and 3. because I have never been more bewildered in my life and I need to put this shit into words to better understand it. So, here goes.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m in a gigantic stone temple in the center of the sun. Ironically, it&#39;s dark as hell in here. The only light comes from these stained-glass windows with purple lamps behind them. Usually they depict scenes of Lifemongers doing magic bullshit with stars and light. The only ones that don&#39;t involve these Lifemongers are in the big central chamber - there&#39;s eight of them, and they&#39;re huge. I think these might be their gods, but they only pray to the big one at the top.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m in the central chamber now, so I&#39;ll try to describe them. Bear in mind there are no captions in any language I could understand.
&gt; 
&gt; The big one: kind of a stork-dragon hybrid with eight arms, each one holding a star. 
&gt; 
&gt; Next to him, going clockwise... 
&gt; 
&gt; There&#39;s seven-headed ferret, holding what I can only assume Dr. Seuss would call a saxophone. 
&gt; 
&gt; A meditating centipede, holding a scimitar. 
&gt; 
&gt; A hawk surrounded by fire, holding a giant black hammer. 
&gt; 
&gt; A deer-man, holding a branch, and I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s giving me bedroom eyes. 
&gt; 
&gt; A sea turtle with a shit-ton of human hands, holding a flute. 
&gt; 
&gt; A spider with a bearded man&#39;s face, holding a needle and thread. This is the only one that has humans in it, looks like a bunch of kneeling knights. 
&gt; 
&gt; And the last one&#39;s been shattered beyond recognition. They didn&#39;t even bother to pick up the pieces. 
&gt; 
&gt; //(Sound of shifting glass shards.)//
&gt; 
&gt; But I think there are enough shards here to get a better look. Let&#39;s see if I can put some of it back toge --
&gt; 
&gt; **ZetBoKu:** {{You yourself insult. VUUOU equals unclean.}}
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** Wait, what? Voo-oh?
&gt; 
&gt; **ZetBoKu:** {{Murk poisons soul. VUUOU unremember. Desist touch evermore.}}
&gt; 
&gt; //(Shifting glass sounds end.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** My bad!
&gt; 
&gt; **ZetBoKu:** {{Correct.}}
&gt; 
&gt; //(Footsteps leading away.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (M):** ...that&#39;s ZetBoKu, by the way. The Lifemongers all got weird names like that. NaUrKa, ZetBoKu, VoSaiLek, pretty sure I heard &#34;LuLuLu&#34; at some point. 
&gt; 
&gt; Dammit, got ahead of myself. I should probably mention what these Lifemongers are in the first place. Here are the top ten things to know.
&gt; 
&gt; **1.** I was never good with measurements, but they&#39;re each about the height of Big Bird on Sesame Street.
&gt; 
&gt; **2.** They&#39;re dressed in these heavy v-necked robes covered in quilted bits of gold, velvet, jewels, chains, furs, tiny paintings -- I dunno, I saw this movie about the old Russian tsars, it&#39;s kinda like the robes they wore. (But only the older ones, like Ivan the Terrible.)
&gt; 
&gt; **3.** They&#39;ve got two arms and stand upright, but like ten or twelve legs. No hands or feet, though, just kinda fleshy little points.
&gt; 
&gt; **4.** Their skin is pale blue.
&gt; 
&gt; **5.** Their heads are... gross. Like, it&#39;s in the shape of an Egyptian ibis, but covered in several films of veins and loose wet membranes, like spider webs. I can&#39;t really tell if their beaks are actual beaks or just curved, meaty protrusions. (They don&#39;t open the beaks when they speak, either.) There&#39;s a dark spot on the sides of their head that&#39;s either heavily-obscured eyes, self-inflicted bruises, or both.
&gt; 
&gt; **6.** Their voices sound male, but I don&#39;t know if they have genders like we do.
&gt; 
&gt; **7.** They&#39;re not from this universe. 
&gt; 
&gt; **8.** They claim to serve this... God? Ruler? Supervisor, priest, local politician? Fuck if I know, but they call him KHUUM[[footnote]](Pron. &#34;Koom&#34;)[[/footnote]] of the Eightfold Jewel, first and eldest prince of &#34;Korbenk&#34; or something. (That&#39;s probably who&#39;s depicted in the big window from earlier.)
&gt; 
&gt; **9.** They&#39;re pacifist monks.
&gt; 
&gt; And finally...
&gt; 
&gt; **10.** They&#39;re a bunch of boring old fucks with //zero// sense of humor.
&gt; 
&gt; As for what this temple //is?//
&gt; 
&gt; //(Sigh.)//
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m still murky on the details. You&#39;ve heard how these guys talk -- it&#39;s hardly ever more than three words in a sentence, and you&#39;re lucky if it&#39;s the //right// word. But here&#39;s what I can understand of it, so far...
&gt; 
&gt; Apparently, our universe is inherently unable to create life, not even on the unicellular level. The only thing that can generate life -- as we know it -- is radiation from the mystical fire produced by KHUUM. Sometimes, KHUUM looks into other dimensions from his own, sees some space dust, and decides that maybe the dust should be a rock with a bunch of little guys on it.
&gt; 
&gt; So KHUUM and his servants build a giant temple-ship called a &#34;SauEl&#34;. (&#34;Sau&#34; means Warmth and &#34;El&#34; means fall.) The infinite power source is a single scale taken from KHUUM&#39;s body. Once a SauEl is flown to a nice area to make a solar system, the flames turn on, and the whole ship starts exuding a flaming aura that&#39;s indistinguishable from an ordinary star. There&#39;s even a gravity well and everything. 
&gt; 
&gt; But on the inside, it&#39;s perfectly chilly and zero-G. (And it&#39;s not like I&#39;m flying all over the place -- the floor has this magnetic effect with both my feet and theirs.)
&gt; 
&gt; The reason I didn&#39;t burn up in orbit is their little security system, as it were -- something called the SueSor. (Sue means &#34;tribute&#34; and Sor means &#34;maiden.&#34;) I never saw this SueSor thingy, but apparently it saw that I was lost and teleported me to safety. 
&gt; 
&gt; There&#39;s one thing I&#39;m forgetting here...
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, right -- this place is meant to be staffed by immortals. I&#39;m not hungry, thirsty, sleepy, I don&#39;t need to go the bathroom -- I don&#39;t even cast a shadow. I forget to breathe sometimes.
&gt; 
&gt; On one hand, it&#39;s good to know I&#39;m safe.
&gt; 
&gt; On the other, the fact that I&#39;m probably going to be trapped here forever is only just starting to sink in, and honestly? It&#39;s scary.
&gt; 
&gt; But on the other-other hand, maybe it&#39;s for the best. This could be eternal damnation -- just the closure I was looking for.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; Hopefully.

&gt; **D-81840 (M):** They&#39;re leading me through this hallway with a big mural. ...or relief.
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** Which is it?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (M):** Look, I didn&#39;t go to art school.
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** A relief is a carving, a mural is painted.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (M):** Ah -- relief. Definitely a relief. Made of gold, or at least some gold-colored metal.
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** Can you describe it?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (M):** There&#39;s... for a full description, I&#39;m gonna need more time. But I can give you a brief once-over.
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** Please do.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (M):** There&#39;s this big Lifemonger in the center extending its arms over a bunch of different creatures below. There&#39;s humans in one corner, but also some...  dragons? Squids? Look, there&#39;s way too many to mention in one go. Fuckin&#39; Noah&#39;s Ark in here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** What&#39;s the creature that sticks out the most?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (M):** I&#39;d say it&#39;s the one that the Lifemonger is standing on. It looks like this, uh, I don&#39;t know the word -- you know those roly-polies you&#39;d find when messin&#39; around in your backyard as a kid?
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** Pillbugs?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (M):** There ya go. Pillbugs. But it&#39;s a big one, and it&#39;s got these trees growing out of its back. It looks like it&#39;s in pain, or --
&gt; 
&gt; **NaUrKa:** {{Furrowers-in-garden.}}
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** Huh?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (M):** It&#39;s pointing to the pillbug.
&gt; 
&gt; **NaUrKa:** {{Furrowers-in-garden. Heretics. Adversaries eternally.}}
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** Really? What&#39;d they do to you? 
&gt; 
&gt; **NaUrKa:** {{Pirates them. Destroy creations ours. Souls... incubated upon death. Crucible of pleasure. Reappropriate life. Generous unto decadence. Life unequals good. Life equals //test.// Defiance, punish required.}}
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** Ah, um, okay. 
&gt; 
&gt; **NaUrKa:** {{Also. Delicious them.}}
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** Wait, what?
&gt; 
&gt; **NaUrKa:** {{...salad.}}
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (M):** Fuckin&#39; weirdos.
&gt; 
&gt; //(More footsteps.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** Where are they taking you now?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (M):** Looks like... some kind of theater. There&#39;s a big crystal wall on a stage. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** Any other Lifemongers?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (M):** Over a hundred... hope I haven&#39;t been drafted into their annual talent show or some shit.
&gt; 
&gt; **NaUrKa:** {{Fellow servants. Gather. Attend.}}
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** Why aren&#39;t they speaking their language to each other?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (M):** Apparently there&#39;s a universal translation field here. But it doesn&#39;t always work with some of their words.
&gt; 
&gt; **NaUrKa:** {{My brothers. This thing equals}} //ZaKaarYa-MeRattoNya-KenTo.// {{Hominid lifeform.}} //EvResh-na KuRuut// {{ambassador}} //SauEl VuorShiente// {{SCP Foundation}} //TaRaa.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** Did you tell them?!
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (M):** I didn&#39;t say nothing! Look at the records if you doubt me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** Thank God...
&gt; 
&gt; **NaUrKa:** //KenTo.// {{Presence of you. We gather. Origin ascertained. Eyes of}} //SauEl-SueSor// {{decoration upon ship. SCP Foundation. Correct? Ergo,}} //SauEl-SueSor// {{granted you passage.}}
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** Sauelsuesor! I knew it.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (M):** What now?
&gt; 
&gt; **NaUrKa:** {{...you are distracted.}}
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** Sorry, uh, just a little brainfart. What were we talking about?
&gt; 
&gt; **NaUrKa:** {{Ignoramus.}}
&gt; 
&gt; //(Something in the background begins humming.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **NaUrKa:** {{Foundation emissary. Only logical conclusion: dispel misunderstanding.}}
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** Oh, right, //that// misunderstanding...
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (M):** //Doc, real quick, what misunderstanding?//
&gt; 
&gt; //(No response; Dr. Tanner is contacting O5 command for an emergency update regarding new activity from [[[SCP-179]]].)//

&gt; 
&gt; **NaUrKa:** {{Cease averting eyes. Breach of protocol.}}
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** But she&#39;s naked...

&gt; //(A soft, feminine voice can be heard.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-179:** Oh? The silly vultures who live in my brother are talking again. Curious!
&gt; 
&gt; **NaUrKa:** {{Maintain silence, prisoner.}}
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** Wait, I&#39;m your prisoner? I thought you said I was --

&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-179:** Must we go over this again? I belong to no one.
&gt; 
&gt; **NaUrKa:** {{Disagree. On similar subject -- misunderstanding.}} //KenTo// {{sent. Heed his words.}} 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (M):** Doc, throw me a fucking bone here...
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-179:** It is all right, little friend. Your star-boat -- he was screaming. There were so many sad little corpses inside his gullet. I know you did not come on your own volition. Unwilling servants -- lost travelers -- regretful souls -- humans (former, in my case) -- our kind understands one another.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (V):** So what was this misunderstanding?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-179:** Those in the Foundation above you wanted my guidance all for themselves, and none other. So they tried to hide me from their competitors.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (M):** ...you guys are dicks, y&#39;know that?
&gt; 
&gt; **NaUrKa:** {{The problem. Is it dispelled? Time unequals expendable.}}
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-179:** But they have done worse to you, little friend, have they not? They put you and your brethren into little boxes. They offered you as a human sacrifice. They flew you into my brother. They made you spy on these horrid little vultures with your mind.

&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:**  Sorry about the radio silence. Are you still in that meeting? What did Sauelsuesor --
&gt; 
&gt; **D-81840 (M):** They&#39;re gonna turn off the sun.
&gt; 
&gt; **Tanner:** ...pardon?
&gt;
