**Item #:** SCP-2829

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-2829 are to be contained in a standard biological containment cell at Area-12. All personnel entering the containment cell must wear a level A hazardous materials suit at all times. All personnel coming in contact with SCP-2829 must also be on a strict regimen of depressant drugs to suppress endorphin production and must be rotated every month after a thorough psychological evaluation. Each instance of SCP-2829 is to be tagged with a Teflon-coated chip for identification, with new instances being tagged as early as possible.

**Description:** SCP-2829 is a set (51 individuals at the time of writing) of amorphous organisms superficially resembling banana slugs (//Ariolimax californicus//). The cells of SCP-2829 instances are structurally similar to human adipocytes[[footnote]]fat cells[[/footnote]], with the exception of an organelle of unknown function fused to the nucleus and a smaller, more folded smooth endoplasmic reticulum. DNA analysis of the cell nucleus shows a 89±6 percent similarity to baseline human DNA.

SCP-2829 reproduces sporadically through budding; the circumstances causing this process are not fully understood at present but are currently thought to be linked to feeding events. Newly-formed daughter organisms instinctively approach humans more eagerly.

SCP-2829 instances are physically active and docile in temperament, and often play by racing each other or competing to form towers by stacking themselves. Around humans, SCP-2829 will become excited and bounce in place. If a nearby person approaches SCP-2829, SCP-2829 will move towards that person and climb onto any exposed skin. After nuzzling the skin, SCP-2829 will secrete a mixture of neurotransmitters that numb the pain response and trigger endorphin production in the person&#39;s body, then slowly fuse with the skin. Once SCP-2829 is fully fused and the person reaches a heightened euphoric state, SCP-2829 will absorb the person&#39;s excess fat then enter a dormant state for several minutes. SCP-2829 will then gradually leave the body. The entire process typically lasts approximately 20 minutes. SCP-2829 does not seem to gain any mass during this process, but tests have shown a possible correlation between the amount of fat absorbed from the subject and the endorphin concentrations just before SCP-2829 exits the body.

**Addendum:** 47 instances of SCP-2829 were recovered from the basement of an abandoned home in ███████, TX, along with the corpse of the house&#39;s owner, Dr. Javier Pineda, a former [[[prometheus-labs-hub|Prometheus Labs]]] employee. An assortment of scientific equipment and various reference books and notebooks were found in the home; the books were damaged beyond recognition, but a series of video logs was partially recovered.

&gt; I don&#39;t care that they kicked me out. I&#39;m better off without Phillips and his ego problems suffocating the lab. There&#39;s gotta be something I can do, something I can make. I can still help her. I just want her to smile again. For once, just let me make something worthwhile.
&gt; 
&gt; **8/28**
&gt; OK, so maybe I didn&#39;t think this through. I don&#39;t got much to work with out here. Calloway&#39;s got my other toolkit last I checked, and nobody&#39;s [[[scp-4849|seen him]]] in years. Gonna have to do it by hand. (//Dr. Pineda cracks his knuckles.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **8/31**
&gt; Damn slugs eatin&#39; my garden. Fat yellow bastards. Can&#39;t they see I&#39;m busy here? 
&gt; 
&gt; **9/1**
&gt; Well, I managed to get ahold of Velasquez, and she was able to get me an old sample of that shelved cell project I did back in the day. Thought they torched all that when they booted me. Not complaining, of course, but now I owe her twice. 
&gt; 
&gt; **9/2**
&gt; OK, good, the little fellas are still viable. I should be able to work out the old kinks no problem. Then I&#39;ll just need a template.
&gt; 
&gt; **9/3**
&gt; This morning those damn slugs came back, chewing on the petunias. Those are her flowers, you bastards! Leave her alone!
&gt; 
&gt; **9/4** 
&gt; Something&#39;s off about those slugs outside, I know it. Can&#39;t put my finger on it, but it&#39;s like they&#39;re waiting for me when I come outside. Or something. I need a new hobby after all this, clear my head.
&gt; 
&gt; **9/5**
&gt; OK. The good news is that the cells work like they used to. The bad news is that they work like they used to.
&gt; 
&gt; **9/12**
&gt; THIS IS THE LAST STRAW, SLUG! Gah! Let&#39;s see how you like it.
&gt; 
&gt; **9/15**
&gt; Congratulations, slug. You&#39;ve finally managed to do some good in this world, for once.
&gt; 
&gt; **9/29**
&gt; OK, I admit. Using the slug as a template was stupid. But it looks like it&#39;s working, so score one for being short-tempered. 
&gt; 
&gt; **10/5**
&gt; I&#39;m gonna have to test this myself. Don&#39;t want the men in black coming after me if I turned some mailman into a slug monster. We all remember what happened [[[scp-3839| last time]]]...
&gt; 
&gt; **10/7**
&gt; Well, slug, you&#39;re as useless as ever. Back to the drawing board. 
&gt; 
&gt; **11/14**
&gt; Why the hell is it stuck to me? Next thing you know it&#39;ll try to take over my brain like some crappy sci-fi movie. Got it out, but that hurt like hell.
&gt; 
&gt; **12/2**
&gt; Third time&#39;s a charm, right? 
&gt; 
&gt; **12/5**
&gt; The slug exploded. Not even sure how I did that one.
&gt; 
&gt; **12/11**
&gt; Alrighty. This one was good, but I think it starved to death. Need to fix that, since their mouths seal up during the process. Hey, why don&#39;t these things have faces afterwards anyway? Okay, think, which one is easier to fix?
&gt; 
&gt; **12/24**
&gt; SUCCESS! Oh, Merry Christmas to me! Seriously, this is great. She&#39;s going to love this. Who would&#39;ve thought a slug would do the trick?
&gt; 
&gt; **12/25**
&gt; I feel great today. Like I&#39;m light as a feather, walking on clouds. Or however that saying goes. I think there&#39;s still room for improvement, though. Needs a little more oomph.
&gt; 
&gt; **12/30**
&gt; OK, version 26. Or 27? I can&#39;t remember. I wrote it down somewhere around here. We&#39;re getting close, I can feel it. 
&gt; 
&gt; **1/4**
&gt; I&#39;m still hungry. And I just had a big breakfast too, was the weird thing. I&#39;mma grab a bite to eat after I test this next one.

The recovery team noted the presence of fresh slime trails leaving the house after the specimens had been secured for transport.
