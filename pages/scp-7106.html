**Item #:** SCP-7106

**Object Class:** Keter

[[include component:image-block name=room.jpg|caption=CC-7106-B simulating nighttime|width=300px]]

**Special Containment Procedures:**

**REVISION 16-15**

Containment chamber is to be modeled after the entity&#39;s former civilian home. SCP-7106 is the primary subject of a continuous Class Q 2737-Alpha (&#34;dementia&#34;) coverup scheme. Depending on the entity&#39;s sleep patterns, covert agents must be inserted into its containment and administer Class B regressive retrograde amnestics via chemicals inserted within food. A cycle is maintained by the containment team where SCP-7106 effectively relives the same set of events, or &#34;day,&#34; within its chamber. A carefully procured schedule of SCP-7106&#39;s average activities within this 16-18 hour period is kept by all operators, whereas specific actors, objects, and other ambient manipulators are to be be inserted in accordance with this cycle.

Arcane tones generated by noise machines will be transmitted through the walls of SCP-7106&#39;s containment in order to induce a form of hypnagogia, causing the entity to become incoherent. Actors within SCP-7106&#39;s containment strategy are to first report for duty in CC-7106-F, an external chamber separate from the entity&#39;s main containment complex, for recitations; review begins at approximately 1:30 PST, approximately 4 hours before SCP-7106 usually awakens.  

███████ ██████████ ██-█████ will be inserted into groceries delivered by Actor B, who plays SCP-7106&#39;s 25-year-old son, Cyrus ██████; the purpose of these chemicals is to further disorient SCP-7106, as well as inducing general nausea, prompting the entity to stay indoors. The floorplan of the object&#39;s containment differs slightly from its original home in that the front and back yards and the balcony are absent; amnestic protocols are in place to ensure SCP-7106 does not notice these discrepancies. Actor A, playing SCP-7106&#39;s wife, Marianne ██████, will convince SCP-7106 to stay indoors and bedridden for the majority of the day, preparing chemically altered soups, microwave meals, and other foods for SCP-7106&#39;s consumption on trays. Both Actors A, B, and secondary actors inserted when necessary, will further reinforce the idea that SCP-7106 has been afflicted with dementia as an explanation to its poor memory. The windows of the containment complex are fitted with monitors which will constantly stream 3D-generated simulations of the outside world, partially obscured via frosted glass.

--Current research into a proposal to render SCP-7106 permanently blind are underway. Coverup protocols are currently being devised.-- SCP-7106 continually grows resistant to Foundation-sanctioned alterations to its body; the average dosage of Class B amnestics must be kept below 12 g as to retard SCP-7106&#39;s adaption, and new methods of delaying these processes and properly disorienting SCP-7106 during its containment cycle are currently being researched. Should SCP-7106, for any reason, become aware of its current situation and/or attempt to breach containment, all housing structures are to be filled with compound ███-█, which is structurally similar to molasses. The goal of flooding is to render the entity unconscious either through heat stress or continuous drowning.

If this fails to incapacitate SCP-7106, personnel are to initiate Recall Protocol ██-███-█.

**Description:** SCP-7106 is a Class III reality-bender. Properties include acute cognitive adaption, projected cognitive alteration, materialization through solid objects, regenerative/extraballistic attributes, and spontaneous reconfiguration of physical materials. Anomalous blood alcohol levels when emitting mucus from skin pores. Not outwardly hostile, however ailments due to old age may render the entity violent. Entity previously went by the name John Henry Styles, former director and host of evangelist television program //The Light Sees You!,// and co-director of former therapeutic Catholic boarding school Rainbow Way Institute, located in Los Alamos, Santa Barbara County, California. The Rainbow Way Institute shut down in 2011 following the murder of a student.

**Addendum SCP-7106-01 - History of SCP-7106 and the Rainbow Way Institute.**
SCP-7106 was born and raised in Montecito, CA and would graduate from UC Santa Barbara with a bachelor&#39;s degree in business and economics, however the entity initially pursued a major in medicine and neuroscience. In 1983, local television program //The Light Sees You!// would be launched by Robert Greenfield, and SCP-7106 would be hired to host the show for unknown reasons. Common topics of discussion on the program were largely Catholic in nature, with SCP-7106 performing &#34;blessings&#34; live onstage to an audience of middle-class Californians. Other topics included sanitation, cooking, county affairs, lobotomy, and parental advice. SCP-7106 would be married to Alexandria Sanchez the same year, but in 1984, Alexandria divorced SCP-7106 for unknown reasons. Alexandria was last seen crossing the California-Arizona state border.

The Rainbow Way Institute was founded in 1987 by child psychologist Gordon Dewitt and SCP-7106. The school advertised itself as a comprehensive child therapy and behavior modification program for troubled teenagers, admitting students ranging from 14 to 18 years old. SCP-7106 would purchase the location which would become the Rainbow Way school&#39;s campus the prior year, which was the site of an abandoned federal penitentiary located ██ miles east of Los Alamos in the remote wilderness. The spokesperson for the program, SCP-7106 touted the Rainbow Way Institute as a &#34;way for Catholic teenagers to find rejuvenation&#34; and &#34;a way to reclaim the hearts and minds of troubled youth.&#34;

Backed by its history as an investor as well as notoriety from serving as the host of //The Light Sees You!//, the Rainbow Way program, under Dewitt and SCP-7106, would promptly see a myriad of concerned parents admitting their own children into the school. Boarding schools of its type were common at the time. Dewitt and 7106 revealed little of the program&#39;s curriculum and methods to the public; therapeutic and behavior modification methods were largely unknown until 1991, when former student Brian Chubbuck published an article as to the school&#39;s activities to a local newspaper. Detractors quickly likened the Rainbow Way Institute to other boarding schools of its nature, most notably the Élan School, for its questionable methods and secretive faculty; of these controversial educational, therapeutic, and disciplinary measures were the use of corporal punishment, emotional and sometimes physical violence, denying access to food or water, and, as alleged by Brian Chubbuck, long hours spent in a &#34;Likening Room;&#34; a dark, cramped closet or boiler room where disobedient students would be locked for up to 25 hours.

The most notable of Chubbuck&#39;s claims are of &#34;Tide Presentations,&#34; where SCP-7106 would randomly select a student from an audience, having apparently been detailed their history by staff, and proceed to openly ridicule them for their past ailments or offenses. Tide Presentations would often end with 7106 physically assaulting the students, leaving them unable to stand until removed by teachers. Chubbuck claimed students vomiting was a common occurrence when faced with SCP-7106, and described the smell as &#34;artificial.&#34;

Though a minority of Los Alamos residents campaigned for law enforcement to investigate the Rainbow Way Institute, the sheriff&#39;s department would fail to follow through with such demands; Chubbuck&#39;s report on the school&#39;s harsh methods would fail to gain notoriety outside of the remote California town, and numerous statements released by Dewitt and SCP-7106 would successfully diffuse these claims and maintain the program&#39;s good reputation.

[[include component:image-block name=door.jpg|caption=Corrosion damage on initial containment chamber. Caused by SCP-7106 becoming violent shortly after recovering from medically-induced coma. SCP has since been revised.|width=300px]]

In 1990, SCP-7106&#39;s 10-year-old son, Cyrus ██████, would undergo brain surgery due to a supposed tumor. Marianne ██████ recounts SCP-7106 itself urging her to consider the operation. SCP-7106 was present throughout the surgery.

The same year, a similar report would emerge from an anonymous source, claiming the Rainbow Way Institute had begun to &#34;kidnap&#34; teenagers from their home at the request of concerned parents, a method not dissimilar from other institutions like Rainbow Way. In 1993, several former students, including Brian Chubbuck, would again come forward with a comprehensive editorial alleging &#34;cult-like&#34; behavior at the school, particularly revolving around SCP-7106. In this editorial, former student Alina Benson would describe &#34;feeling a presence sinking through the walls&#34; of the student bunks, &#34;[that] felt just like the piercing gaze of [SCP-7106] himself.&#34; She would go on to describe SCP-7106 emerging through the floor beside her bunk and watching her as to assure she went to sleep. Benson accused SCP-7106 of having a particular attraction or fascination towards her. The Foundation failed to take notice of these claims, identifying them as descriptions of either hallucinations or lucid nightmares. Alina Benson would also fail to clarify on the nature of these absurd claims, leading many to believe they were fabricated or the result of mental anguish. //Note: Foundation personnel have noted Benson&#39;s physical resemblance to the late Melanie Ortiz.//

From 1993 onward, the Rainbow Way Institute would oversee a graduate turnout of 99%. Most graduates thought highly of the school, Dewitt, and SCP-7106. In 2001, Gordon Dewitt would die in a Santa Clara car crash, leaving SCP-7106 as the sole director of the program. From this point onward, as recounted by SCP-7106&#39;s ex-wife Marianne ██████, the entity&#39;s visits to the campus would take a drastic upturn. SCP-7106 would travel to the Rainbow Way Institute on a weekly basis, and would become acutely divested in the lives and educations of its students. SCP-7106 would often initiate discussions on human thought and neuroscience during this period.

In 2009, 16-year-old Melanie Ortiz would be admitted to the Rainbow Way Institute. In 2011, her body was found near the ██ ████ Estate Winery. Postmortem autopsy immediately revealed several bruises along her neck, as well as two prominent lacerations sinking deep into her shoulder blades and right breast. Based on the state of these lacerations and the chemical burns identified therein, law enforcement believed the perpetrator to have attempted to dissolve Ortiz&#39;s body in acid before leaving it in the wilderness. As the controversial Élan School had been closed only a month prior, and with the details of the case being spread to internet forums such as Reddit and Twitter, the death of Melanie Ortiz would lead to the eventual closure of the Rainbow Way Institute. SCP-7106 was identified as one of the prime suspects in her killing, having been at the campus at the time of her death, however was ruled out shortly after interrogations were held.

It wouldn&#39;t be until 3 days later when Marianne ██████ called the Santa Barbara Sheriff&#39;s Department that the Foundation would be notified of SCP-7106&#39;s nature. According to Marianne, SCP-7106 had become drunk and attempted to physically assault her, when he &#34;disappeared through the floor&#34; and &#34;destroyed the door, the kitchen; dissolved everything,&#34; &#34;he reached up and bit me with his hand through the ground.&#34; After acquisition, UIU agents would identify that a portion of the house had been destroyed by what appeared to be an unidentified acidic substance. Traces of mucus were found around burn sites, and a narrow tunnel was located beneath the ground floor, tracing from the kitchen to the upstairs bedroom. Several photographs were found in SCP-7106&#39;s study, all of teenage girls of Hispanic descent; later identified as previous Rainbow Way Institute students. A detailed diagram of a human brain was also discovered, traced back to 7106&#39;s work in university. Genetic material belonging to Melanie Ortiz was uncovered within the house.

**Addendum SCP-7106-04 - Portion of the witness report on the Rainbow Way School via former student Joseph Sanders.**

&gt; &lt;Begin Log at 0h-24m-39s&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** Were you ever hurt during your time there?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** Yeah.
&gt; 
&gt; [Sanders adjusts in his seat, maintaining eye contact with Dr. MacLeod.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** Kids got hit, I guess. Had to do more chores. Sometimes we were spanked. Sometimes it meant extra Bible study time. Not just spanking, uh-- sometimes they slapped us. Some of them put on these cotton mitts, sometimes, and took us to the back of the building and slapped us while they scolded us. People weren&#39;t allowed to talk about that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** Anything else?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** I-I don&#39;t know.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** Joseph, if anything else happened, at all, we need to know.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** I don&#39;t know. I can&#39;t remember. I never saw much. This was a long time ago, okay?[[footnote]] Sanders graduated from the Rainbow Way Institute in 1996. [[/footnote]] This is just how it was. We were disconnected from God. We were spoiled rotten. I feel awful for Melanie, truly, but--
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** Joseph. We already have a good idea as to the motives behind it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** Okay.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** Understand that I am not asking if it was right or wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** Okay. I understand.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** So you&#39;re sure nothing else happened? Physically or emotionally?
&gt; 
&gt; [Sanders shifts again. He clears his throat.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** Sometimes, John would come to class. He&#39;d talk to us. Pick our minds a bit.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** Okay.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** Y&#39;know. He was the celebrity. Everyone wanted a piece of that guy. The, uh, supervisors would swarm him. He was always talking with them. We weren&#39;t really allowed to interact with him, unless he came to us first. He was nice to talk to. He was smart, very nice. I don&#39;t know.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** Mr. Styles used to perform miracles on his television show. Have you seen this show, Joseph?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** Yeah. Uh, I&#39;d watch it with my family when I was younger.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** Do you remember Mr. Styles ever performing these miracles at the school? While he was visiting?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** Yeah. Yeah, always. I mean, that&#39;s the reason, uh, people were so excited to see him, right? He--
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** Describe his process, please.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** Well, um, he&#39;d get someone from the audience and do his thing. He--He&#39;d &#39;project good will upon them.&#39; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** Elaborate, please.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** I don&#39;t know.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** Did he perform any rituals? Or did he just point at them and they were cured? What happened?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** He brang them up. On stage, next to the podium with him, and he&#39;d hold them in place and turn them around back to the audience and... and, uh, bop them on the head.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** Was it just one hit or did they go on? How strong was it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** Well, uh, sometimes the kids would resist. Like we always did. When he did his blessings, he had to force it in them, really put in some effort, y&#39;know. So... I mean I guess it went on for a while. We called it &#39;Tide Presentation,&#39; whenever he&#39;d come and bless us.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** Were you ever called up?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** No. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** Are you sure? Do you know anyone who was?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** No, no. Wait. I remember now, he did call me up one time.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** Explain.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** He--... Well... Here&#39;s the thing about me back then; I was a queer.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** Okay.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** Wasn&#39;t raised as a queer, but I was one. My parents knew there was something wrong with me and sent me to get taken care of. He... I didn&#39;t talk much. Nobody really knew who I was, that I was gay. That&#39;s why I never got in trouble. If you didn&#39;t wanna get in trouble, you were obedient, and obedient kids were quiet, did what they were told. But if my parents--... Whatever. John knew about me. It was my second year, that was when he pointed at me with that great big old smile on his face. His eyes were peeled on me since he entered the building.
&gt; 
&gt; I remember the looks I got. Like everyone knew. I hated that. That look. He called me up. His voice was so loud, and I went up there immediately. I was shaking so hard I thought my shirt was gonna come right off my body. Cause it was so loose back then, and he looked and me and told me, &#34;Boy, you oughtta get yourself a new shirt.&#34; And I said &#34;Yes, Mr. John Henry, I&#39;ll get one when I&#39;m well enough to go back home.&#34; He laughed and he... Well, he...
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** It&#39;s okay. Take your time, Joseph.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** Well, he struck me, right across the head. I didn&#39;t feel... cured. I remember... I remember being so scared. Scared of him, scared of the people sitting and staring. So I put my hands up over my head and guarded myself. He yelled some sermon or prayer and the class repeated after him as his fist came down on me again and again. I was curled up on the floor bleeding and wailing. He kicked me in the stomach. I remember throwing up. He said something about a demon coming outta me. I hurled again. This... soup. It was like oil. And i-it hurt, too. Whatever it was, I don&#39;t know, I didn&#39;t ever think something like that could come from me. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** Anything else?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** I&#39;m not sure. That&#39;s all I can remember. He did what he had to do.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** Alright. I&#39;m gonna run some names past you, and I want you to see if you can recognize any of them, okay?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** Y-Yeah.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** [REDACTED]
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** No.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** Gordon Dewitt.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** No.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** [REDACTED]
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** No.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** Okay. Thank you. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** Should I know about that stuff? I mean, is it important?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** Don&#39;t worry about it. From our knowledge, you were never permitted to talk to other kids at camp, am I right?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** No. Instructors didn&#39;t like it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** Were you allowed to talk to the instructors?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** No. I mean, I never did. Not after--...
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** Sorry?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** It&#39;s nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** No, please, by all means.
&gt; 
&gt; [Sanders sighs.]
&gt;   
&gt; **Sanders:** I remember when I was a kid, there was this other boy who I would see at school. We were best friends. We liked going down to the creek and fish for tadpoles. The parents hated each other, I knew it. I had that gut feeling. I thought... he was like me. In a lot of ways, yeah, we were similar. That&#39;s why we were friends. It felt like nobody else quite understood me the way I did. We both bounced our legs when we didn&#39;t focus. We flicked our hands. When I was at his house, I got to watch bad shows my parents would keep me away from. His parents never scolded him for leg-bouncing or hand-flapping. Stuff my folks said wasn&#39;t normal. Said I needed to act normal, but Colby seemed normal enough to me. We understood each other like that.
&gt; 
&gt; Back then, I lived near San Francisco. I remember when we were both sixteen, I took a trip with his family to the headlands. They rented out this cabin and a tour guide, and we went on nature tours with this big group of people. I stuck by Colby&#39;s side, all the way through, because I was scared of nature. He held my hand. He told me nothing was gonna happen and if it did, he&#39;d protect me. He always said stupid stuff like that, and I always believed him. Because I knew... it was true. I always believed him.
&gt; 
&gt; And... We were sitting by the fire one night. It was the last night of our trip. His parents were off somewhere else, so it was just me and him. I told him about my home life. How I was always inside, never got to go out like this. I thanked him for... giving me a childhood. For being my best friend. I remember the way he smiled at me. Like looking at the stars. He was always starry-eyed, he was always moving around like a comet. And I did what felt natural. I kissed him. He was my first. He was my only kiss.
&gt; 
&gt; Somehow, some way, it got back to my parents. And that&#39;s why they sent me to Rainbow Way. So they could pray the gay outta me. Because I wasn&#39;t normal.
&gt; 
&gt; A few years after I got outta that school, I was at my friend&#39;s housewarming party in Carp.[[footnote]] Carpinteria, a city in Santa Barbara County. [[/footnote]] Nobody really talked to me. Which was fine, sure, I was always the quiet one. The odd one out. Now that I think about it, I hadn&#39;t really talked to anyone since that night. And then, guess who showed up. Colby, all grown up. He looked the exact same. Had the same stars in his eyes. Same smile.
&gt; 
&gt; [Sanders leans forward. Eyes become watery.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** God. He was the same as he always was. He was the same nice kid who always found me alone at recess, y&#39;know? He talked to everyone. Helped introduce me to new people. When he saw me he was carrying a tray of little cakes, but he dropped them on whatever table was nearby and gave me the biggest hug. Said he missed me like crazy. I remember seeing him... and this acid welled up in my throat. I walked away. I pretended he didn&#39;t exist.
&gt; 
&gt; I couldn&#39;t compose myself. I was shaking all throughout the party. Eventually I excused myself and went to sit outside. It was night, and the stars were out. The air was cold. Suddenly, Colby came next to me and sat. He asked if he&#39;d done anything wrong. I said no, I was just nervous. But he told me he wasn&#39;t asking about today, he was asking about... about that night. I looked at him. I remember looking at him. He was beautiful. He... he smiled, and...
&gt; 
&gt; I threw up. Then I ran to my car and got away. Because when I looked at him, I--I felt John Henry&#39;s hand beating the acid out of me.
&gt; 
&gt; [Sanders curls up on his seat. 2m pause.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** He did something to me. [sniffs] He did something to me. I don&#39;t know.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** Is this acid prominent?
&gt; 
&gt; [Silence for 13 seconds.]
&gt; 
&gt;  **Dr. MacLeod:** You keep returning to this acid. In every case we&#39;ve reviewed, in every victim of John&#39;s we&#39;ve interviewed, that&#39;s what stands out. This acid. Is there anything else you can remember?
&gt; 
&gt; [Silence for 10 seconds.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** He picked our minds. Not just... talking to us. Not just the beatings. I really mean it, he did something to me. It was like he was inside me and made me throw up. I remember the vomit on Colby&#39;s shirt. It was black as night. Just like John Henry.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** You&#39;ve seen John vomit?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** No.
&gt; 
&gt; [Sanders sits up.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** After the Tide Presentation, one of the supervisors took me back into John Henry&#39;s trailer. They did this for every volunteer he took up. I remember there was still vomit on my shirt. It was stained black. They took me to him and he looked at me and smiled. I was scared he was gonna hit me again, but instead he reached deep inside me and broke the bone.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. MacLeod:** Sorry?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sanders:** He filtered his hands through my skull and broke me. And all I can remember from that point on is choking to death.
