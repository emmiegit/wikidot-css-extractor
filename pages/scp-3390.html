**Item #:** SCP-3390

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Floor B19 of Site-99 is to remain in a permanent state of lockdown, power to this floor is to remain cut and all entrances to be destroyed or sealed, with exception to the lower fire exit stairwell which must remain behind its magnetically sealed blast door. This door is to be kept under observation until protocol violet has been completed.

What remains of Site-99 Floor B19 is to be considered temporary containment zone 617α and is for the exclusive containment of SCP-3390 until it can be removed and secured in a more permanent containment location. All personnel and equipment on this floor are to be considered irretrievable.

Standard containment procedures regarding Breach Level and Temporary Containment scenarios are to be followed in the addition that no personnel with Germanic heritage, within two generations, are to enter Site-99 nor are any personnel to make disparaging remarks in regards to the performance of the French military forces, or the nation of France in general.

In the event of a failure of temporary containment, the three members of foundation personnel assigned to the monitoring of SCP-3390 are to remain behind until the containment status of SCP-3390 can be confirmed. Otherwise, standard evacuation protocols are to be observed. 


**Description:** Due to the nature in which it is contained SCP-3390 has been able to evade all attempts at a full examination. As a result, all information pertaining to the description of SCP-3390, both physically and in reference to its anomalous effects are entirely through physical observation via eyewitness reports and security camera footage.


SCP-3390 is a large mechanical construct that is superficially identical to a Char2C Armoured Fighting vehicle, or tank, manufactured 1919 and constructed by the Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée (FCM) company for the French Armed Forces during the period of the First World War.


SCP-3390 is approximately 4 meters high, 10 meters in length, 3 meters in width and is expected to be at least 70 tonnes in weight. It is painted in a dark green color typical of French Army forest camouflage schemes of the period and is showing signs of wear and tear that can be assumed to be from age and lack of maintenance.


Prior to Incident 3390-1, the anomalous effects of SCP-3390 were unrecorded. It remained in an inactive state and was contained within a standard vehicle containment garage at the Site-99 underground motor-pool pending classification.
Following incident 3390-1 SCP-3390 was observed via closed circuit security cameras until power to floor B19 was lost.

++ __Incident-3390-1__


[[=]]
&gt; **SCP Foundation Site-99**
&gt; **SCP-3390**
&gt; **Incident Number**: 3390-1
&gt; **Date:** 18th September 19██
[[/=]]

&gt; **Summary of Incident:** Events leading to SCP-3390&#39;s current containment conditions.


&gt; **Timeline of events** 
&gt;
&gt; 4:35am 
&gt; Security Camera footage observing SCP-3390 at Section D of the underground containment motor-pool at Site-99 notes two members of security personnel, identified as ████ ████████ and ██████ ██████, patrolling the area stopping to observe SCP-3390. The remote mic picks up the two discussing Second World War history. 

&gt; 4:41am 
&gt; Guards return to their patrol route continuing to discuss history. One of the guards identified as ████ ████████ utters the words &#34;Cheese Eating Surrender Monkeys&#34;, a common insult directed at the performance of the French forces during World War Two, at which point the engine of SCP-3390 turns over. Both guards are seen turning in confusion and SCP-3390 accelerates towards them.
&gt; Cause of death to both guards was through crushing injury.

&gt; 4:42am
&gt; SCP-3390 continues moving on an eastern projectory, it enters the D-block staff carpark at 4:44 am after breaching the secondary containment wall of SCP-████. It pauses for exactly 2 minutes and opens fire 4 times with the 75mm cannon located in the main frontal turret, destroying several vehicles. Reason for this is currently under investigation.
&gt; Details of destroyed vehicles are listed here:
&gt; Personal vehicle of Dr. Lambart Steel, BMW X5 Black
&gt; Personal vehicle of Dr. Andrew Shepard, Volkswagen Golf White
&gt; Personal vehicle of O-class Micheal Brown, Audi A3 Yellow
&gt; Site-99 Utility Vehicle, Unimog U4000 Orange

&gt; 4:43am 
&gt; Containment Alarm is sounded, Site-99 begins evacuation protocol.

&gt; 4:46am
&gt; SCP-3390 continues moving on an eastern trajectory in a straight line. It penetrates the inner wall of the facility and enters corridor 44/B partially destroying Site-99&#39;s D-Lab block resulting in the deaths of ██ Personnel and injuring ██ others.

&gt; 4:50am 
&gt; SCP-3390 has accelerated to a speed of 31kph and continues to move through the facility with complete disregard for any objects or persons in its way. SCP-3390 Demonstrates the capability to drive through solid objects beyond the expected capability for a machine of its design and period including concrete barricades, thick metal walls, and solid steel doors.

&gt; 4:52am 
&gt; SCP-3390 penetrates D-Lab blast door, now entering Section F staff cafeteria.
&gt; Security Personnel are witnessed opening fire using standard weaponry, SCP-3390 appears undamaged and returns fire.
&gt; [DATA EXPUNGED]
&gt; Resulting blast weakens structure around staff cafeteria causing part of section F to collapse. SCP-3390 is witnessed falling with the collapse.
&gt; SCP-3390 continues downwards through the facility, coming to a rest at Floor B19
&gt; Current containment protocols were initiated

&gt; And after we get up there I think we&#39;ve all agreed we&#39;re coming to your office to have a little &#34;discussion&#34;.

&gt; Scratch my last. The hole was blocked by debris, we tried clearing some of it but that thing just came at us again. I think I&#39;m the only one left now, I think it knows it too.
&gt; It&#39;s weird, every time I see it I get a sense of purpose from it like it knows what it&#39;s doing. It&#39;s stupid I know but I just can&#39;t help shake the feeling we&#39;re dealing with something intelligent here.
&gt; Look I&#39;m sorry for what I said but please, it&#39;s guarding the blast door now, if I can slip past it I can sneak up the stairs.

&gt; It saw me. But it didn&#39;t attack. It just stared, kept looking between me and the blast door. It&#39;s weird, I get that sense of purpose again, I couldn&#39;t do anything I just ran but it didn&#39;t follow. Maybe it feels sorry for me. Remember to write that down in its document, SCP shows more compassion for researchers than you do.

&gt; It wants out. Not into the facility but outside, it&#39;s going somewhere or rather it &#39;NEEDS&#39; to be somewhere. Don&#39;t ask me how or why I just know ok. Like I look at it and I just get this overwhelming feeling of what it wants.
&gt; It broke down the door to the freight elevator but the power was out, it kept trying to do something to the panel but I couldn&#39;t see what.
&gt; I&#39;m going to try approaching it, if it is intelligent it can be reasoned with.
&gt; Also I broke open one of the vending machines for food, feel free to put my ass on disciplinary for that.

&gt; 7:09 am Camera Footage shows SCP-3390 attempting to over-ride the lockout on the freight elevator. The camera was not mounted in a position where it able to ascertain how SCP-3390 was able to do this. After several moments Freight elevator becomes active and descends to floor B19.
&gt; Upon Arrival SCP-3390 enters the elevator and attempts to activate it before power to the entire floor is manually cut.

&gt; 7:12 am Camera, now on battery power, notes a large mechanical sounding scream followed by a series of violent explosions. Dust and smoke obscure the camera lens. SCP-3390 is not sighted and no further sounds are recorded for seven hours by which point battery expires and camera ceases operation.

&gt; 2:30 pm Probe camera mounted to a small robot sent to ascertain the status of SCP-3390 and locate any survivors.
&gt; After initiating standard sweep SCP-3390 was discovered still within freight elevator. SCP-3390 was motionless however service panel to the elevator was open and the floor was scattered with various Foundation equipment, most notably batteries. Many of these were jammed into service panel. Again no indication of how SCP-3390 was capable of achieving this.

&gt; 2:46 pm Body of ████████ located. The body was slumped in a seated position near blast door. Eyes appeared open in shock, face, and torso covered in deep scratch marks, large camera battery forcefully inserted into mouth.

&gt; 2:51 pm Bodies of ██████,███,██████ and ████████ discovered. Each body appeared heavily mutilated with ███████████████████ forced into the various orifice of each corpse along with what appeared to be a large novelty inflatable dolphin presumed to have been taken from the staff lounge. Security footage did not note any personnel removing object from staff lounge during nor prior to the incident. 

&gt; ██:██pm robot ceased operation at █ hours, reasons unknown. 

**Final Statement** A localized earthquake reported on ██/██/██ caused flooding to various sections of floor B19 hindering any capability to remotely observe SCP-3390. A final report gathered on the ██th of  ████  ████ showed that SCP-3390 had moved from the service elevator towards a disused storage room on the eastern side of the facility. This report also claimed that SCP-3390 appeared to be ████████.
Reasons for this are, again, not understood.
