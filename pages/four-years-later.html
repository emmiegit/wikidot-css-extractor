**File:** T90-AL-T-4104-23

**Personnel:** J. Smithson (Team Commander), R. Hernandez, T. Aluko, Z. Feng, J. Weiss, A. Zheng

-----

{{EXCERPT BEGINS}}

**SMITHSON:** Alright, you lot, there it is. Nearly there now. Trez, still clear to the rear, mate?

**ALUKO:** All clear, all clear.

**SMITHSON:** Brilliant. Let&#39;s stay switched on. We&#39;ll be back for tea and medals in no time.

//(Muffled laughter.)//

**HERNANDEZ:** You don&#39;t even drink tea, boss.

**WEISS:** Keep it professional on comms, please, Hernandez.

**HERNANDEZ:** I copy, keep it professional. Like the boss.

**ZHENG:** Trooper Hernandez. When you rise to command a tac team, you can say what you like on the team net. Until then, //listen to Specialist Weiss.//

**HERNANDEZ:** Ma&#39;am.

//(Several minutes of silence.)//

**FENG:** Sir! Ahead, eleven.

**SMITHSON:** I see it. Nice one, Feng. Alright. //(Short clicking sound.)// Ninety Command, this is One-Zero Actual.

**COMMAND:** This is Command. Go ahead 10-A.

**SMITHSON:** We&#39;re getting to the perimeter now. Probably let the post know.

**COMMAND:** Copy, you&#39;re getting to the perimeter. I&#39;ll talk to the post now.

//(Short pause.)//

**COMMAND:** One-Zero Actual, this is Ninety Command. No response from the post.

**SMITHSON:** Copy, Command, no response from post. Should we stand by?

**COMMAND:** 10-A, yes, stand by just within the anomaly. I&#39;m sending Post 33 to check on 32. Probably dead batteries again.

**SMITHSON:** Command, copy you&#39;re sending 33 to check. But it&#39;s rarely dead batteries, in my experience. Going to keep my eyes open until we&#39;re out.

**COMMAND:** 10-A, copy that. Seems wise. Stay just inside the boundary.

**SMITHSON:** Just inside the boundary, copy. //(Clicking sound.)// Okay, you lot. We&#39;re staying here because Post 32 isn&#39;t answering calls from Command.

//(Several audible groans in the background.)//

**SMITHSON:** Yeah, I know. Command thinks it&#39;s probably a dead battery. I think we&#39;ve got another Curious George. Probably see them in here in a minute Weiss-ing all over the place.

**WEISS:** //(Under her breath, laughing)// Oh my god.

**ALUKO:** Weiss-ing, boss?

**ZHENG:** We&#39;ll tell you later, Ms. Aluko. Mind on task, please.

**ALUKO:** Copy, you&#39;ll tell m--

//(Several loud sharp cracks interrupt ALUKO.)//

**FENG:** Boss--

**ZHENG:** JASON!

**HERNANDEZ:** Fuck! Fuck, that was from fucking outside!

**COMMAND:** One-Zero, report? Was that a contact?

//(A muffled third-party voice can be heard issuing a challenge.)//

**FENG:** Are you fucking kidding me, the fucking G.O.---

**WEISS:** //(interrupting)// CEASE FIRE! THIS IS FOUNDATION MOBILE TASK FORCE THETA-90! CEASE FIRE, CEASE FIRE, CEASE FIRE!!

//(Indistinct third-party voice.)//

**ZHENG:** Come on where&#39;s the tourniquet come on come on come on fuck come ooonnnnnn--

**COMMAND:** One-Zero, please respond.

**HERNANDEZ:** --fucking team commander! This skip&#39;s one of //ours,// what the fuck are you-

//(Multiple voices trying to speak at once.)//

**WEISS:** One-Zero, that&#39;s **enough!** This isn&#39;t helping. //Minds on task.//

//(Short pause.)//

**WEISS:** Aluko, help Zheng with that tourniquet. Feng, get on the net and get medics. The rest of you, stand by to move.

**FENG:** Ma&#39;am. //(FENG switches to COMMAND emergency channel)//

//(Third party voice begins to speak, but is cut off by WEISS.)//

**WEISS:** -- Yeah, I know what you //thought// - that&#39;s fucking obvious. So are you going to help us, or not?

**ZHENG:** -- fuck fuck fuck JASON-

**WEISS:** Zheng! Zheng... ah, shit. Aluko. Can you move him? Yes? Good. Make sure Zheng comes with you. ONE-ZERO! Let&#39;s move! You idiots, too: move, move, //move!//

//(Tactical Team 10 exits the anomaly boundary, accompanied by GOC PHYSICS Division personnel responsible for the incident.)//

&#34;Not exactly your finest hour, was it, Jane?&#34;

Weiss rolled her eyes. &#34;I think I did a pretty good job, considering.&#34;

&#34;Considering what?&#34;

&#34;Considering how shitty my role model was. And that it was my first ever field command. And that we all thought you were going to die.&#34;

Jason Smithson laughed. &#34;Leg still hurts like buggery every time it rains. But I s&#39;ppose I //must// have been a shitty commander if the Gaggle Of Clowns managed to get me, eh?&#34;

&#34;Maybe! I don&#39;t think you disappointed &#39;Drinia, though.&#34;

&#34;Weiss. I&#39;m //right here.//&#34; Zheng turned her head in Weiss&#39; direction briefly, a half-smile on her face. &#34;I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m going to be able to visit for lunch anymore if you two are going to keep rehashing the shittiest day of my life.&#34;

Smithson mock-pouted. &#34;And I thought the shittiest day of your life was when you transferred out of the Grinders and lost your excuse to HIDE your SECRET FEELINGS FOR ME--&#34;

&#34;Stop it!&#34; Zheng laughed. Weiss had never heard that laugh before Zheng and Smithson had gotten together. Now, she heard it all the time.

&#34;I&#39;m just saying, when everything I took the piss out of you for ended up being TRUE--&#34;

&#34;Don&#39;t push it, //Captain.//&#34; Zheng grinned. &#34;I can quit your silly puns and questionable British food any time I like.&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s what all the addicts say, love.&#34;

&#34;Tosser.&#34;

&#34;See? You even use all my words and that!&#34;

&#34;It //is// a good one,&#34; said Weiss. &#34;And you //are// a tosser.&#34; She turned to Zheng. &#34;Shit, it&#39;s good to see you, Alexandrinia. I wish we saw you more.&#34;

&#34;Steady on, mate!&#34; Smithson raised his eyebrows in mock horror. &#34;It&#39;s hard enough getting the Foundation to let Zhengie and I see one another as it is, and we&#39;re bloody engaged. If you start cutting in on the deal, we&#39;re going to have to get into visitation rights.&#34;

Before Weiss could answer, a cup of black coffee was placed on the table and a familiar face sat down to drink it. Smithson cheered. &#34;Fuckin&#39; hell! My hero and savior has descended from the heavens to mingle with the plebs!&#34;

Treasure Aluko chuckled. &#34;I swear, you help save a guy //one// time, he never lets you hear the end of it...&#34;

&#34;Mate. I&#39;ve told you to stop saying you only helped. Way I heard it, you pretty much carted me out of there single-handedly.&#34;

&#34;And she helped stop the bleeding,&#34; Zheng said. &#34;More than I could do,&#34; she added, not quite quietly enough.

&#34;Love. We&#39;ve talked about this.&#34;

&#34;I know, but--&#34;

&#34;You&#39;d never seen someone shot up for real--&#34;

&#34;Yes, but I--&#34;

&#34;--let alone the bloke you //fancied//.&#34;

&#34;...Do you //have// to remind me about that five times a day, Jason?&#34;

&#34;//Yes.//&#34;

That laughter again. &#34;Well, you&#39;re consistent, if nothing else.&#34;

&#34;Speaking of consistency&#34; - Smithson got up - &#34;I&#39;m trying to avoid being consistently late for afternoon classes.&#34;

Aluko raised an eyebrow. &#34;Of all the things I thought you might get into when I met you, that was about last, Jase.&#34;

&#34;Teaching? Eh, it&#39;s alright if the students are alright, and we usually get decent people in. Present company excepted, obviously.&#34;

&#34;Obviously,&#34; said Weiss, punching Smithson&#39;s hip lightly.

&#34;OW! You bloody KNOW that&#39;s my bad hip, you twa--&#34;

&#34;//Jason.//&#34;

&#34;--you... mean lady,&#34; Smithson finished, before glancing accusingly at Zheng. &#34;And that&#39;s not fair, love. You can&#39;t just do The Voice to stop me swearing.&#34;

&#34;I can do The Voice for any reason I please,&#34; said Zheng with a smirk.

&#34;Mint. Can you use it to stop Paulie quitting?&#34;

Zheng&#39;s face fell. &#34;I wish. He says he wants to come to my group, and I&#39;d be happy to have him, but it just seems so...&#34; She waved her hand. &#34;Not right.&#34;

Aluko sipped her coffee. &#34;He hasn&#39;t been the same the last few months. We&#39;ve all seen it.&#34; She nodded at Weiss. &#34;You saw it first, though.&#34;

Weiss sighed. &#34;Yeah. Yeah, I did. He just looks like... someone drained all the motivation out of him and replaced it with being tired all the time.&#34;

&#34;Maybe he is,&#34; said Zheng. &#34;I was worried enough for Jason when he got promoted, even though he mostly does training now. Let alone the stresses Dimaccio&#39;s been under. You&#39;ve got to wonder how long someone can carry on as the commander of even a little MTF like this before the stuff they&#39;ve seen and the stuff they&#39;ve heard becomes too much to deal with. There are some things that amnestics can&#39;t help. Not if you still want to be you at the end.&#34;

&#34;Well, one thing&#39;s for sure, love. I&#39;m gonna need amnestics to forget the arse-kicking I get if I&#39;m late to teach class again.&#34; Smithson kissed Zheng&#39;s cheek, and waved to the others. &#34;Pleasure as always, my friends. Stay lazy!&#34;

Aluko pointed at Weiss. &#34;Her? No chance. Me? I don&#39;t need to be told. See you later, Jase!&#34;

&#34;Yeah,&#34; said Weiss, her mind somewhere else: on a worn-out, drained face that had seemed so confident and intimidating just a few years ago.

&#34;See you later.&#34;
