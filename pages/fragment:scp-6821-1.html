**Special Containment Procedures:** Area-34&#39;s security personnel working nighttime shifts (9PM-6AM) are to be equipped with melee weapons at least partially constructed from iron. Nighttime patrols of Area-34 are to be mostly done by female personnel. If a male employee must be scheduled for a nighttime patrol, said employee must be unmarried or in any other form of romantic relationship.

Containment chambers have been prepared within Area-34 in the event that an SCP-6821 instance is captured. All security personnel assigned to the wing the instance is contained in must be equipped with the same weapons constructed for nighttime personnel. Married male personnel are to be discouraged from entering the same wing the instance is contained in.

**Description:** SCP-6821 refers to a subspecies of Fae (//Homo sapiens sidhe docendo//) found in the Central American region. SCP-6821 is most prevalent in the nations of Costa Rica, Panama, and Nicaragua, where concentrations of their populations can be found. SCP-6821 instances are humanoid in shape but are capable of limited polymorphism. Regardless of sex, SCP-6821 instances generally appear similar to a Fae female, only differing in appearance by having a head that resembles that of a decomposing equine and lacking the characteristic wings.

SCP-6821 instances are generally only active at night, mostly staying away from developed areas such as cities and towns. Instances seem to prefer the less developed boroughs of towns or more forested areas. The diet of SCP-6821 is unknown, although it is assumed that they have similar nutritional needs to humans and other species of fae.

SCP-6821 instances have shown the capability to manipulate the mental state of targets, making them more suspectable and open to suggestion. This effect is much more pronounced in male targets, especially those in romantic relationships. So far, SCP-6821 instances have only been seen using this ability to lure away their targets. It is unknown what SCP-6821 does with those it lures, although it is suspected that this is their source of sustenance.

**Addendum 6821.1:** Discovery

SCP-6821 was rumoured to exist since the founding of Area-34, as many of those who aided in constructing the facility claimed to see figures matching the description of what was later classified as SCP-6821. These rumours were disregarded, as beings similar to SCP-6821 existed in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sihuanaba local folklore] of Central America. SCP-6821 was first confirmed to exist, however, in 2005, when security cameras around the perimeter of Area-34 captured a squadron of patrolmen being lured away by SCP-6821 instances. Since then, similar incidents of Area-34 personnel being lured away by SCP-6821 instances have only increased in frequency, resulting in the current containment procedures being put in place to deter further attacks.

**Addendum 6821.2:** Incidents Involving SCP-6821

The following table catalogues all known incidents involving SCP-6821 in a given year. Not all of the reported incidents resulted in individuals being drawn away by SCP-6821, and many of them were just brief sightings. Of those incidents that involve interactions between individuals and SCP-6821 instances, barely any of these resulted in casualties. Throughout the years represented below, Area-34 lost more personnel to local fauna and human error than to SCP-6821 encounters.

**Addendum.6821.3:** INCA Meeting

In 2007, following a minor spike of incidents involving SCP-6821, Dir. Felipe Everest, who was both the director of Area-34 and the Department of Anomalous Weapons Development, scheduled a meeting with an official from INCA[[footnote]] //Institución de Normalidad Centroamericana// (GoI-0827), an organisation focused on the preservation of normalcy. INCA is funded by and primarily operates in the nations of Central America. [[/footnote]]. The following is the relevant portion of the transcript.

**[DATA REDACTED FOR BRIEVITY]**
[[/=]]

**Director Felipe Everest:** I have another thing to ask of you, Hugo. Me and my people in our facility down in Costa Rica have run into a bit of an issue. One I was hoping you could aid in alleviating it.

**Hugo Berganza:** We can at least try. What&#39;s wrong?

**Dir. Everest:** For about a year or so now, the guards we post at night have been attacked by these figures. We&#39;ve classified them as SCP-6821. So far, they&#39;ve appeared as women to us, but with the head of a horse or a mule.

**Berganza:** //La Cegua//, then?

**Dir. Everest:** //[Sigh]// //Cegua//, yes, but I&#39;d rather not call them that.

**Berganza:** Why not? Does the name have power or something?

**Dir. Everest:** No, no. I&#39;d just rather not think all those fairy tales are real.

**Berganza:** //[Laughter.]// I&#39;m surprised that you&#39;ve made it this far with that mindset... The //Ceg-//, sorry, the beings. They&#39;re fae in origin. We think they&#39;re from Spain, probably hitched a ride on some conquistador ships and made their way here way back when. Aside from how they look and their effect on men, they&#39;re just like any other fairy. Brandish some iron and they&#39;ll run the other direction. That&#39;s what we do at least.

**Dir. Everest:** I see... //[Pause]// You said they&#39;re from Spain?

**Berganza:** Yes, or somewhere around there. We&#39;ve never really had the funds to send men to go and see if this is true. It&#39;s not really of that high a priority either.
[[/div]]

Following this meeting, Dir. Everest contacted [[[scp-4179|Site-178]]], and requested for an investigation to be done into any fae entities in the Iberian Peninsula. The inquiry eventually returned with records indicating that a small group of fae once lived in what is now the Principality of Asturias. Further research into the existence and nature of these fae is needed, but they have been tentatively designated SCP-6821-O.

**Addendum 6821.4:** 2016 Decommissioning Proposal

In 2016, a decommissioning proposal was submitted by Senior Ezra Everest[[footnote]] Dr. Ezra Everest, a high-performing member of AWD and son of then-Director Felipe Everest. [[/footnote]]. This decomm. proposal was made and sent in response to a major increase in SCP-6821 incidents beginning in 2012, which wouldn&#39;t end until 2018:

[[div class=&#34;alt-blockquote&#34;]]
[[=]]
++ __**SCP Object Decommissioning Proposal Form**__
[[/=]]
**Item #:** SCP-6821

**Object Class:** Keter

**Head Researcher:** Senior Engineer Ezra Everest

**Supporting Personnel:**
* //Asst. Dir. Luisa Hurtado - Representing Area-34//
* //Chief Elisabet Morterero - Representing Area-34&#39;s Security Division//

**Please check off or fill in the applicable boxes regarding the reasons for submitting your proposal:**
☑ Excessively High Risk of Lifted Veil Scenario
☑ Excessive Danger
☐ Ability to Decom. Apollyon-Class Object
☑ Expense
☐ Ethical Concerns Over Necessary Containment
☐ Legal Concerns
☐ High Risk of K-Class Scenario (if so, please state which type(s):@@____@@)
☐ Other (please state):

**Summary:** The continued attacks on Area-34&#39;s night guards by SCP-6821 instances are unacceptable, especially if they continue increasing at the rate they are now. The iron that the Security Division&#39;s weapons have to be made from to fend off these fae could be put to better use in other AWD Projects. Furthermore, the reportedly high population of SCP-6821 in Central America could pose a serious risk to the Veil if civilian contact is ever made. //-- Dr. Ezra Everest//
[[/div]]

Attached to the decomm. proposal was several documents detailing potential ways to successfully neutralize or permanently ward off SCP-6821 from Area-34. After some debate, and council from both Area-34 Director Felipe Everest and the previously-mentioned INCA Representative Hugo Berganza, the proposal was ultimately declined.

**Addendum.6821.5:** Attack on Area-34

On November 24th, 2017, at 2200 hours, a group of approximately 43 SCP-6821 instances launched a full-scale attack on Area-34. As Area-34 had just finished the transition into the night shift staff team, it was unprepared for an offensive of this size. Wielding their anomalous properties and a before-unknown adeptness at hand-to-hand combat, the 43 instances were capable of breaching into the reception area of Area-34 before being successfully pushed back into the jungle surrounding Area-34.

The incident resulted in the deaths of 4 security personnel, with 25 injured. This attack on Area-34 prompted a resubmission of Dr. Everest&#39;s decommissioning proposal, which came with some more support of the administration of Area-34. It was ultimately re-denied.

**Addendum 6821.6:** 2018 Decommonissioning Proposal

On February 21st, 2018, during his return from a visit to Site-01, Dir. Felipe Everest&#39;s convoy was attacked by unknown assailants. While a majority of those in the convoy survived, Dir. Everest was one of the few unfortunate casualties. After a week of deliberation, his son, Dr. Ezra Everest, was appointed as the new Director of AWD and Area-34 on February 28th.

On February 29th, another decommissioning proposal was submitted by Dr. Everest. The proposal was largely the same as the one sent in 2016, minus the inclusion of any supporting personnel. After INCA Representative Berganza was reached out for his opinion, he requested a meeting with Dr. Everest:

**Doctor Ezra Everest:** Hugo. Pleasure to meet you.

**Hugo Berganza:** Like-wise, Ezra. Say, has anyone ever told you that you look a lot like your father? Same ey--

**Dr. Everest:** I would prefer not to be compared to my late father.

**Berganza:** //[Chuckle]// Duly noted... I&#39;m sure you know why I asked to talk with you today? About your...

**Dr. Everest:** My request to decommission those //Cegua//, yes. I don&#39;t see an issue with that. Guessing from your previous discussions with my father your organisation has had problems with them in the past. I&#39;m sure you&#39;d like to get rid of them as well. They&#39;re not even originally from this land.

**Berganza:** Yes, but they&#39;ve still been for the last 500 years. They&#39;ve had plenty of time to integrate themselves into the local environment. For all we know they could be the backbone of the local ecosystem. Have you even bothered looking into any potential consequences of killing them?

**Dr. Everest:** There&#39;s no need to. They&#39;re anomalous. A deviation from the norm. There&#39;s no need for them to be here. Even if they&#39;ve &#34;integrated themselves into the local environment&#34;, I&#39;m sure it can bounce back from just one lost species.

//[Silence.]//

**Dr. Everest:** I captured one of them a while ago. I experimented on the thing. Tested everything I could think of on it, seeing what hurt it, and refined it to make it hurt even more. They&#39;re a bit more resilient to iron than their brethren, but enough of it will get the job done. I&#39;m already set on exterminating these pests, and you&#39;re not gonna change my mind.

**Berganza:** I- //[Sigh]// I hope you know we don&#39;t approve of this, Everest.

**Dr. Everest:** And I hope you know you have no authority within the Foundation, Berganza.

**Addendum.6821.7:** AWD Design Dossier

+++* SCP-6821 Dossier

//Department of Anomalous Weapons Development Design Packet//
[[size 75%]]//Compiled by Director Ezra Everest//[[/size]]
[[/=]]
----
**Description of Target:** Species is a subspecies of fae, originating from Spain and now found in Central America. Species is mostly humanoid with the head of an equine but possess some limited polymorphism. Species is capable of luring away male victims via anomalous means.

**Potential Exploitable Weaknesses:**

# ##red|**[UNUSABLE]**## - As a subspecies of //Homo sapiens sidhe//, Species burn when they come in contact with any ferrous object, such as the iron weapons currently being employed by Area-34&#39;s Security Division. Equipping MTF Io-27[[footnote]] Mobile Task Force Io-27 (&#34;Big Sticks&#34;) is a battalion-sized task force that acts in response to actions taken by hostile GoI in Central America. [[/footnote]] with paraweaponry based on iron, then deploying them throughout Central America could reduce the Species population beyond recovery. //**Reasoning:** Deploying a Mobile Task Force the size of Io-27 throughout the entirety of Central America could prove more dangerous to the Veil than allowing Species to remain.//
# ##green|**[CLEARED]**## - Species, as a subspecies of //Homo sapiens//, is believed to be highly a social one. Introducing a genetically engineered virus with a high infection rate and low requirements for transmission could quickly spread throughout the entire Species population, assuming the symptoms it induces do not kill the host in too short a period.

**Notes on Weapon-6821-2:**

//The paraweapon is a genetically engineered virus, developed by some of our engineers who specialized in virology. I&#39;m not too keen on most of the details, but we&#39;ve designed the virus with the following traits in mind://

* //High infection rate.//
* //Incubation rate of 1-2 months.//
* //Transmutation of hemocytes into iron through alchemical processes.//

//We plan to release the paraweapon into the open through a captive instance of SCP-6821 we have in Area-34. It&#39;s been designed so it won&#39;t begin to show any symptoms in a host until they&#39;ve infected as many people as possible. It gives the 6821 population less time to react to it and deals with them a lot quicker than we could otherwise. We&#39;ve also designed the virus to minimize the risk of it jumping over to humans, so we won&#39;t have to worry about any reports of people dying from excess iron in their blood.//

**Status of Weapon-6821-2:** {{WEAPON ENGINEEERED, RELEASED.}}
[[/div]]

On April 23rd, the captive instance of SCP-6821 was infected with Weapon-6821-2 and received amnestic treatment before being released into the wild. Since then, the amount of incidents reported involving SCP-6821 has begun to drastically decrease, as can be seen for the reports in 2018 and 2019 in **Addendum.6821.2**.

**Addendum 6821.8:** SCP-6821-0

In 2018, researchers from Area-34 and Site-178 discovered documentation from //Buscadores de Dios en Nueva España//[[footnote]] Seekers of God in New Spain (GoI-1025), a national organisation funded by the Spanish Empire that operated in Spanish colonies in the Americas during the colonial period. [[/footnote]] related to both SCP-6821-0 and SCP-6821.

[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block-peppo
|name=http://scpdsandbox.wikidot.com/local--files/cegua/zero.jpg
|caption= An illustration believed to depict an instance of SCP-6821-0.
|width=300px
]]

These documents indicate that SCP-6821-0 was a group of fae that existed on the Iberian Peninsula before the 17th century. During the 16th Century, the Spanish monarchy began a system of courting these fae and convincing them to agree to be relocated to Central America. By 1650, no SCP-6821-0 instances remained in Spain.

In the New World, these SCP-6821-0 instances were used by colonial officials to enforce their laws upon the indigenous and //mestizo// population. This involved threatening locals with the chance of being attacked by an SCP-6821-0 instance if they stayed out too late at night or took part in delinquent activity. However, unaccustomed to the rigid hierarchy of the Spanish colonial government, SCP-6821-0 proved to be difficult to control. This resulted in stricter behaviour towards SCP-6821-0 instances, with harsh punishments being dealt out to those who disobeyed colonial officials.

Eventually, as it became too difficult to continue using SCP-6821-0 instances, colonial governments set the instances free. There are mentions of SCP-6821-0 instances becoming romantically involved with those living in Central America, but the documents themselves portray these claims as questionable.

The appearances of the SCP-6821-0 instances as described in these documents greatly resemble humans. It is believed that the appearances of SCP-6821-0 instances changed over time to better accommodate their role as fearmongers for the colonial powers, eventually resulting in their modern appearance. It is unknown why SCP-6821 instances haven&#39;t reverted to their past appearance, and it is presumed that they are incapable of doing so.

**Addendum 6821.9:** Infected SCP-6821 Instance

On November 24th of 2019, an SCP-6821 instance was spotted approaching Area-34. The instance was noticeably skinnier than previous spotted instances, with an overall sickly appearance. A dark red liquid could be seen coming out of its mouth. The instance managed to get to the outer gate of Area-34 before collapsing, upon which it was recovered by a security patrol. The instance was deceased upon recovery, and a post-mortem analysis determined Weapon-6821-2 to be the cause of death. The instance carried upon their body a torn piece of paper:

On the back was a crude hand-drawn map, presumably leading to multiple SCP-6821 settlements. Unfortunately, due to a lack of markings and overall poor quality, the map was deemed unusable.
