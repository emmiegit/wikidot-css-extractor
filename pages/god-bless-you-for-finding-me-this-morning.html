&#34;I was making on the train back home to my wife and two boys after a month-long work trip. I&#39;d been receiving countless letters from the three eagerly waiting for me to come back, and deep down I think I was just as excited. As the train was passing through... uh... oh it&#39;s escaped me now... Bolsover Universe I think it was, I saw something moving on the tracks ahead. I thought it was an animal or something, so I pulled the emergency brakes. I got off and ran closer to the thing. It looked like a faceless, velvety heap that was clearly hurt. I wasn&#39;t taking my chances, though; I&#39;d heard many a story about Lampeter employees getting eaten by countless creatures from across the multiverse. I unsheathed my knife and approached. When I reached it, I kicked it on its side to get a better look at it. It groaned; it was a man! I sheathed my knife and bent down, and that&#39;s when he started talking.

He looked relieved that I&#39;d found him. He said he hadn&#39;t seen another soul in days. That he was a refugee from a couple universes over. He had escaped some weeks earlier and settled down in Carmarthen Universe. They&#39;d been holding strong, but... he said he had to go back. He&#39;d left his mother back there and couldn&#39;t bear to forget her. His family told him it was too risky, but he left regardless. He took two weeks worth of rations with him and followed the Lampeter tracks. Lampeter has been under strain over the past couple decades, so he knew the next train wouldn&#39;t be for another week, //at least//. He said I should try it sometime; there&#39;s plenty to see. I told him I ran a busy schedule. We laughed together.

The conductor told me to leave the man, as he was running late on schedule. How could someone see a man dying and only think of schedule? I thought for a moment, then carried the man off the tracks and onto the grass. I signaled for the conductor to continue on, and he did. The boys will have to wait a little longer. The man told me that he underestimated the length of the journey, and he began to run out of rations. He was afraid to go looking for food, in case he lost his way. He didn&#39;t remember how long he walked, but he kept walking, only stopping to sleep.

Eventually, he collapsed outside the compound where his mother was. They didn&#39;t recognise him, presumably because of how dehydrated and starved he was. They took him inside for processing, and got him fed. It was wartime food, but food nonetheless, so he ate ferociously. It was then that he came to his senses and kept his head down. They toured him around the town he grew up in as he eyed off the detention compound. He had gotten out of there, with children and wife, so logically he should be able to get in.

For a second time, the man snuck out after curfew. He made his way into the scrap yard and scrounged for a piece of long and flat metal plating. He narrowly slipped past marching soldiers, and up to the side of the detention compound. He&#39;d vigorously mapped the place, but didn&#39;t know which cell his mother was in. He dug his makeshift shovel into the dirt and got to work. He laid down when the guards came close, and resumed work when they left. The first cell was empty, and he was in such a position that he couldn&#39;t peek other to the other cells. He began work on the second cell. He peeked in to see a husk of a man fiddling pensively, and a tired but hopeful woman looking at him. She was pregnant. He took a moment to consider. Of //course// he would take them; this was non-negotiable. But... no. He had barely made the trip himself, and to subject a pregnant woman through that would be certain death. They had better chances here. Something left the poor woman&#39;s eyes as I moved to pull away. I heard her scream. She&#39;d seen what they do here, and couldn&#39;t stand another minute of it. I heard myself in those screams. I heard a cell door swing open, and then I heard thumping. The screaming stopped.

The man filled the hole back up to avoid suspicion, and moved onto the next cell. His hopes were dashed when he peeked in to see a teenager rocking back and forth on the floor babbling incoherently to himself. He spotted the man in his peripheral vision and swung around to look at him. The babbling became louder and more desperate. He madly scrambled to the hole in an effort to escape. Even for his size, he could not fit. Upon this realisation, he stopped scrambling and began crying loudly. Hairs on the back of the man&#39;s head stood up as he realised the compromising situation he was in and pushed the boy back back into the cell. He cried louder. Footsteps. He pushed the dirt back into the hole. //Footsteps//. Nearly done. **Footsteps.** Just a tiny bit of dirt lef -
...
...
The footsteps stop.
A guard has rounded the corner and is staring directly at the man. He steps back in shock and inexperience before lifting his whistle to his lips. In desperation, the man lunges at the guard, knocking him to the floor. They begin to violently tussle on the floor, stuck in a stalemate of endurance. The man - through a feat of prowess that surprised both the guard and himself - swiveled around into a choke hold. Despite the guard&#39;s training, the best he could do was flail in the direction of the man. As the last of the strength drained from the guard, a faint &#34;I&#39;m sorry&#34; followed by a fainter &#34;Please stop&#34; emanated from his mouth. The man knew he could not. The risk of alerting the rest of the guards was too great, and he //wasn&#39;t// ending up back in here. As he felt the guard go limp, he let go and put two fingers to his neck. He had gone too far. He stoop up to get a better look at the guard. He couldn&#39;t have been older than fifteen.

He arranged the guard into a more respectful position, then picked up his makeshift shovel and continued onward. He approached the wall of the next cell with low hopes. He pushed the plating into the dirt once again, beginning to tire from it. After some time, he had cleared a big enough hole. He pushed his head through, and there she was! She was sitting absentmindedly on the bed, unaware of him. He called out to her at a cautious volume, and she turned her frail head to him. It was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. Tears came to his eyes, and I offered him my handkerchief. He took it, thanking me.

He dug the hole wider to fit her through. After doing so, he peeked into it and called his mother in. She merely looked on transfixed. He called again, slightly louder. Nothing. What had they done to her? Just a couple weeks earlier she was witty and energetic, and now she was a husk. The man reluctantly crawled through the hole to retrieve her mother, who thankfully walked with him, although she continued her distant gaze. This was going to be difficult.

He began guiding her through the widened hole, but swiftly pulled her back when he saw a guard. He waited until he passed by, then guided her back through again. Now in the home stretch, he slinked through the town&#39;s shadows. As the houses became sparser, he knew he was close to the edge of town. His pace quickened, still guiding the old woman along.
+ BANG!
All of a sudden, he felt a numbingly strong slap to his face. As the numbness began to wear off, he felt himself flung off his feet by a heatwave that surrounded his every thought. Just as quickly as it had begun, he fell to the hard dirt as every element of the experience came back to him in an immensely painful sensation. His face stung. His front throbbed. His back was grazed. In a blurry daze, he managed to make out a rather large crater and... no... there! His mother laying fatigued on the ground. He collected his thoughts and grabbed his mother before locating the source of the explosion. There weren&#39;t any mines, the street was... why was the street empty? It wasn&#39;t exactly bustling when he came into town, but there was still //some// activity. Was the town under lock down? Were they searching for his mother? That can&#39;t be right there&#39;d be an annou- -
+ BANG!
This explosion was some distance away, but it got him to look up. There he found a fleet of familiar aircraft; the town was under attack.

This was no longer about stealth and invisibility, this was about //speed//. After the recent weapons developments, the man knew that hiding was not an option. The civilians didn&#39;t know that, but that wasn&#39;t his current priority. He felt a strong urge to break into an open sprint, but knew this was not feasible with his mother trailing behind. He instead opted for a light sprint.
+ BANG!
The man falls back as he finds himself just outside of the blast range of an explosion. He winced at the impact of the bruise on his backside, albeit numbed by the adrenaline. He got him and his mother to his feet and ran.
And ran.
And ran.

He eventually found himself far out of town, taking a moment to break. He took off his ragged shirt - to much discomfort - to reveal a burnt and bloody wound. He took off his shirt and tore off enough to wrap around his torso. After doing so, he put his dirtied coat back on. There were some frosty universes ahead, and besides, he had nothing else to wear. His mother held the same distant stare, although this time accompanied by a disconcerting wheezing sound. Her arm was bloodied, so the man tied the remainder of his shirt around it. The grass and the pain and the spent adrenaline all called him to rest in the pastures, and he finally conceded.

The man woke. He would not have the liberty of night to cover his now criminal face, but the tracks were not far. He shook his mother, who began to wake. He wished nothing more than to hear her call good morning to him, but it was instead conveyed through an unreadable stare. Is this what he came all this way for? Risked his life for? Was there something worth saving deep down? Of //course// there was. Carmarthen had some of the best psychs in the southern arm. All he had to do was get her there.

All he had to do was get her there.

And so he repeated his trek with coat on bare chest, loosely followed by disinterested eyes. Through grass plains and tundra, on concrete and silicon, past fallout and sandstorm. He ate off the land where he could, sometimes going days through arid or non-existent terrain. Not a single Lampeter train passed through, not a soul stopped to help him. All those capable of doing so looked down on him, and all those who did not look down on him were incapable of helping him. Is this a fact of the multiverse? Is the only multiversal constant rewards to the ignorant and damnation to the compassionate? No. It couldn&#39;t possibly be. Not if his family had managed the trip to Carmarthen. Not if a kind stranger had stopped to hear his story.

She never made it in the end. &#39;Were you surprised?&#39; he asked. I was not, and you are clearly not. He buried her on a hill in Chirk, under unfamiliar species of flower. He thought for a moment, weeped for a moment longer, then marched on. He knew he needn&#39;t dwell on it with the task ahead. &#39;The rest is more or less history,&#39; he remarked. The last couple universes had been much too infertile for any sort of food to grow. I hurriedly pulled a chocolate bar from a Chert&#39;s Chocolates shop close to my work, he pushed it away. He knew it would not be nearly enough to get him to a more substantial meal. This was meant to be.

He asked a favour of me. He asked me to go to Carmarthen. To tell you that he was foolish to go back, and he&#39;d do anything to be back with you. However, he also told me that whatever this may mean for you is up to you. Do with this situation what you will, and do not let it pull you down a spiral. Oh, and he also said that you might be a bit happier without his bickering. We laughed and cried, together.&#34;

The man&#39;s wife&#39;s mouth cracked open after an extended silence.

&#34;Thank you.&#34;

I quietly stood up from the table and turned for the door, but...

&#34;He never told me, and I just had to ask; what... what was his name?&#34;

...
...

&#34;Patrick.&#34;

I turned to face her, both of us revealing each others wet cheeks. I walked up to her. We laughed and cried, together.
