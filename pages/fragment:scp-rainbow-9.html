##red|After all the requisite research has been completed, final containment procedures can be designed. Since containment is the most important aspect of any SCP project, there is no need to heavily constrain your resource use as long as it successfully contains the anomaly.##

**Revised SCP Entry:**

&gt; **Item #:** SCP-7000
&gt; 
&gt; **Object Class:** Keter
&gt; 
&gt; **Special Containment Procedures:** Possible SCP-7000 instances are to be monitored using the TELLER-I/O Unit. Should the probability of convergence register above 80%, the nearest Foundation site is to dispatch a drone to intercept the origin raincloud and lace the water vapor with Compound-Y059. This will modify the index of refraction of the raindrops as to create a broader band of wavelength dispersion, heavily reducing the probability of instantiating a secondary rainbow.
&gt; 
&gt; Should a secondary rainbow still instantiate, and convergence remains stable, Foundation personnel are to amnestize those affected by SCP-7000, and monitor their actions.
&gt; 
&gt; All remaining SCP-7000-2 samples are to be stored in glass vials. Consumption of SCP-7000-2 samples is forbidden, due to lack of research on their long-term effects.  
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** SCP-7000 is the phenomenon of physical, reachable rainbow termini manifestation. The method of manifestation is described in Dr. Teller&#39;s __Reaching the End of a Rainbow: A Theory on Optical Convergence__. SCP-7000 instances act as portals to extra-spatial caverns. SCP-7000 instances that originate from secondary rainbows will be inhabited by SCP-7000-1 instances.
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-7000-1 instances[[footnote]]##red|When using sub-designations, it is good form to have as little space between the first use of the sub-designation in the description, and the definition of the sub-designation.##[[/footnote]] are insects that resemble the Coccinellidae genus, however they measure approximately 0.75m in length and 0.5m in width, and have green wings with white dots. These insects are sentient, sapient, and through harmonized clicks, can approximate human speech using a similar method to pianos that utilize MIDI to recreate speech.
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-7000-1 instances claim to be the mythical creature known as the &#34;Leprechaun&#34;, however share no physical resemblance. They store a nectar (SCP-7000-2), that, upon consumption, increases the consumer&#39;s luck (See experiment log for examples). 
&gt; 
&gt; During the manifestation of an SCP-7000 instance, humans near the terminus from a secondary rainbow will fall unconscious through an unknown mechanism. While these human remain unconscious, SCP-7000-1 instances will attempt to force feed them large volumes of SCP-7000-2, to increase their luck by extreme amounts. Affected persons will experience intense luck for a short period, before quickly returning to normal probabilistic existence. This sudden change in fortunes often takes affected persons by surprise, leading them into deep misfortune, as they often do not have the proper skills, knowledge, or disposition to maintain their position that they achieved under the effects of SCP-7000.
&gt; 
&gt; The mechanism by which civilians either forget, or fail to perceive SCP-7000 instances from primary rainbows is unknown.[[footnote]]##red|Clearly stating the lingering questions from an SCP project is crucial in case further research is performed on this anomaly by a new project lead.##[[/footnote]]

------

##red|After the final SCP document has been submitted and approved, you will have your final debriefing with either your mentor, a senior site researcher, or the site research sub-director to formally close out your role as project lead. You will likely be contacted in case any new developments arise, but otherwise your focus will shift to new SCP projects. Your debriefing after your first SCP Project is also the last meeting you will have with your mentor, as their mentee. From there on out, you will be considered a fully functioning, autonomous anomalous researcher.## 

**Debriefing:**

&gt; **Mackey:** Afternoon William.
&gt; 
&gt; **Teller:** H-hello. Sorry it&#39;s taken so long to arrange this meeting...
&gt; 
&gt; **Mackey:** I get it, you&#39;ve been busy with those other projects. How have those been going?
&gt; 
&gt; **Teller:** Well... really, um, really well. But I did want to talk to you about that.
&gt; 
&gt; //Teller clears his throat.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Teller:** I would like to formally step down from my position as lead SCP researcher. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Mackey:** Is this still about SCP-7000?
&gt; 
&gt; **Teller:** I think that it is... unwise for me to continue in this position. I made it through my last project because of SCP-7000-2, but I do not believe that I have the skills to lead anomaly research. It would be best if someone properly qualified took over before my luck catches up with me.
&gt; 
&gt; //Mackey sighs.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Mackey:** Have you submitted the paperwork to HR?
&gt; 
&gt; **Teller:** Not yet. I— I wanted to tell you first.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mackey:** I see. Well, let&#39;s table that discussion for now. I do actually have some questions about SCP-7000 for our debriefing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Teller:** Oh. Right, of course. Sorry.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mackey:** Alright, first question: did you keep in touch with Norm at all outside of the field missions? You two were both covered in goop together.
&gt; 
&gt; **Teller:** N-no. Not really anyways.  
&gt; 
&gt; **Mackey:** Ah. Then I&#39;ll fill you in a bit. Two weeks after our mission, his car broke down on the way to work and he had to call triple A. Then the next week, his girlfriend caught COVID and they couldn&#39;t see each other for ten days. And then a few days ago, he stubbed his toe real fucking bad on the stairs.
&gt; 
&gt; **Teller:** Ok... I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;re telling me that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mackey:** Next question: Did you ever finish those tests on other applications of SCP-7000-2? Like through skin contact.
&gt; 
&gt; **Teller:** No. Uh, I didn&#39;t.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mackey:** Last question: when you were rolling around in goop, did any of it get in your mouth?
&gt; 
&gt; **Teller:** I don&#39;t think so... but— wait.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mackey:** You&#39;re smart enough to connect the dots.
&gt; 
&gt; **Teller:** But that&#39;s such a small sample size! Barely any evidence at all. And— and— and that doesn&#39;t explain why everything fit together so nicely! Or why my new projects have felt so easy!
&gt; 
&gt; //Mackey walks around to the other side of his desk and claps Teller on the back.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Mackey:** Face it kid, you&#39;re not lucky. You&#39;re just talented.</textarea></pre>
