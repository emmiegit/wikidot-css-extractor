**Item #:** SCP-6458

**Object Class:** --Keter-- Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6458 is currently contained in a soundproof humanoid containment chamber on Floor 10 of Site-149. SCP-6458 must //always// be classified as Safe, regardless of the containment risks his anomalous abilities may suggest. Only the research team devoted to SCP-6458, in addition to site personnel with Level-4 clearance, may be aware of SCP-6458&#39;s existence. SCP-6458 must always be referred to with male pronouns or as SCP-6458, and never as &#34;it&#34; or alternative dehumanizing terms. 

Efforts are to be taken to maintain the psychological and physical well-being of SCP-6458. These measures are necessary to preserve SCP-6458&#39;s acceptance of his containment, to reduce his needs to communicate, and to prevent a decline in his mental state.[[footnote]] As it has been hypothesized that a decline in SCP-6458&#39;s mental state could inadvertently trigger his anomalous abilities[[/footnote]] These measures include providing SCP-6458 with a variety of meals, consistent medical checkups, and time outside of his cell. 

SCP-6458 must be monitored by his assigned security personnel at all times. SCP-6458 is required to wear soundproof headphones and a mask possessing voice-suppressing capabilities whenever he leaves his cell. SCP-6458 is allowed to listen to non-lyrical music through his headphones[[footnote]]However, the music played must be relaxed and calming in nature.[[/footnote]], and has been provided with a text-to-speech device specially-designed to filter out figurative language so that he may communicate his needs with facility personnel. Both SCP-6458 and the security personnel accompanying him must possess two (2) triple A batteries, which will be used in the event that the batteries in SCP-6458&#39;s headphones are depleted. If SCP-6458&#39;s soundproof headphones cannot return to a functioning state for any reason, SCP-6458 must be returned to his cell immediately and in silence. 

SCP-6488&#39;s brain activity is to be heavily monitored when he enters a resting state. It is critical that, before entering a resting state, SCP-6458 is administered a specialized variant of Class-I amnestics effectively capable of preventing him from dreaming by not only temporarily blocking SCP-6458&#39;s access to his memories, but also inhibiting his ability to picture ideas or scenarios in his head. If efforts to prevent SCP-6458 from dreaming fail, he is to be awoken immediately, and prevented from returning to a resting state until any and all issues can be resolved. SCP-6458&#39;s escort is to always be in possession of smelling salts to account for the possibility of SCP-6458 fainting. 

If SCP-6458&#39;s anomalous abilities are activated as a result of speech, the individual responsible must be immediately administered Class-B amnestics[[footnote]]If the memory has existed for over 24 hours, Class-C amnestics should be administered instead[[/footnote]]. If SCP-6458&#39;s abilities are activated as a result of SCP-6458&#39;s perception, SCP-6458 must be administered the appropriate amnestics. If SCP-6458&#39;s anomalous abilities are activated as a result of written information about him, the source must be immediately destroyed.  

**Description:** Following Incident-6458-14, SCP-6458 is Marcus Literal, a male human of European descent. SCP-6458 does not appear or behave any differently from a normal human being, and has been nothing but cooperative with the personnel responsible for his containment.

Whenever SCP-6458 perceives anything without a concrete meaning or presenting a dissonance with his actuality, reality is warped to a literal interpretation of what he sees or hears. SCP-6458&#39;s anomalous abilities can be activated through figurative language, art, dreams, music, representations, and/or forms of deception. This anomalous ability could be inadvertently activated by SCP-6458&#39;s speech, but only in the presence of others. In addition, personnel discussing SCP-6458, even outside his perception, can inadvertently activate his abilities if they use anything other than literal and concrete terms in their discourse. 

The enabling of SCP-6458&#39;s anomalous properties seems to depend entirely on intention. Anyone attempting to activate SCP-6458&#39;s abilities intentionally, be it through speech, music or visuals, find themselves unable to do so. Because of this, testing of SCP-6458&#39;s abilities is impossible, and the only documented incidents of this anomalous phenomena occurring have been spontaneous and accidental in nature. A list of incidents attributed to SCP-6458&#39;s abilities have been listed in Incident-Log-6458-01 (Pre-Containment) and -02 (Post-Containment). 

While the enabling of SCP-6458&#39;s abilities are tied to his perception, the continuance of the resulting phenomena are directly tied to the memory of SCP-6458[[footnote]] Or in cases where SCP-6458&#39;s abilities were activated outside of his perception, the memories of the individual responsible[[/footnote]]. Therefore, amnestics have proven to be an effective method of reversing SCP-6458&#39;s anomalous effects. In cases of documentation and physical enablers of SCP-6458&#39;s abilities, the only way to reverse the effects is to destroy the source material.

**Recovery:** SCP-6458 was retrieved in the city of Phoenix, Arizona. After multiple unexplained reality-alterations found in the area were traced back to him, operatives of MTF Iota-10 (&#34;Damn Feds&#34;) were dispatched to his house. Details of the retrieval can be found in Incident-Log-6458-02.

**__Pre-Containment Incident-Log-6458__**

**Foreword:** The following incidents are identified anomalous phenomena that have been tied to SCP-6458, occurring in the same 3-day span. This list may not be a complete catalog of the changes SCP-6458 has unknowingly made on reality. 

**Incident-6458-01**
**Location:** ████████ Park
**Cause:** SCP-6458 overhears a passing comment, &#34;Man, summer is the worst, it gets hot as hell out here.&#34; 
**Event:** All botanical life present within a 100 meter radius of SCP-6458&#39;s location becomes engulfed in impossible flames, which proved incapable of being extinguished by local firefighters. The fire did not seem to spread past the affected zone, resulting in the ████████ Park being cordoned off. Agents planted in local law enforcement agencies brought the incident to the attention of the Foundation. 
**Type:** Simile 

**Incident-6458-02**
**Location:** Local Restaurant 
**Cause:** SCP-6458 and his date wait at a table, &#34;When did we order our food, like an hour ago? They are taking forever in there.&#34; 
**Event:** Every restaurant employee involved in the preparation of SCP-6458&#39;s food found themselves unable to stop what they were doing, with every step taking an impossibly long time to complete. The unaffected employees eventually called the local authorities, unsure of what was happening. The employees inside the restaurant were unable to be removed through persuasion or force, and eventually expired due to exhaustion. The bodies remained unable to be moved, and the restaurant was shut down. 
**Type:** Hyperbole  

**Incident-6458-03**
**Cause:** SCP-6458 engages in a conversation with his roommate, &#34;Y&#39;know, I&#39;m thinking I might actually attend ████████ University down in Florida. I mean, between all of the other options I&#39;ve taken a look at, it really does seem like it has the best of both worlds.&#34;
**Event:** The University of ████████ experienced a multiversal shift, in which multiple sections of the campus were swapped for a &#34;superior&#34; equivalent present in an alternate reality. Foundation personnel did not become aware of the shift until [[[SCP-6896 | an incident resulting in the death of a group of college students several months later.]]]
**Type:** Idiom

**Incident-6458-04**
**Location:** The home of SCP-6458&#39;s brother.
**Cause:** SCP-6458 listens to his niece, Alyssa Tang, &#34;This is my unicorn, Sprinkles! She&#39;s my best friend!&#34; 
**Event:** &#34;Sprinkles&#34; seems to gain some form of sentience. The stuffed unicorn appeared to be aware of its unusual existence, and kept its newfound awareness hidden from all persons other than Alyssa Tang. It&#39;s existence remained secret from the Foundation until Peter Tang, brother of SCP-6458, discovered it was alive and attempted to report the fact to the toy&#39;s creator.
**Type:** Personification

**Incident-6458-05**
**Cause:** SCP-6458 overhears a passing conversation, &#34;Did you see that new waitress they brought in to replace Lilly? Woof!&#34; 
**Event:** Passerby transmutes into a German Shepard. 
**Type:** Onomatopoeia
//Yeah I know the feeling, pal.// - Dr. Kain Pathos Crow

**Incident-6458-06**
**Location:** Art museum located in Phoenix, Arizona. 
**Cause:** SCP-6458 views a painting called &#34;Number 1A&#34; by Jackson Pollock. SCP-6458 is originally confused about what the painting means, but eventually settles for the idea that it may be representing a storm, or something similar.
**Event:** The viewed painting gradually converts itself into a detailed image of a dark thunderstorm over a raging ocean, a change which is eventually discovered by the museum&#39;s employees, who report the &#34;original&#34; painting stolen.
**Type:** Abstract Art 

**Incident-6458-07**
**Location:** SCP-6458&#39;s dining room.
**Cause:** SCP-6458 is celebrating his birthday, and is told to make a wish before blowing out the candle. 
**Event:** SCP-6458 and his family win an all-inclusive vacation to Miami, Florida the next morning, which is received through the mail. The sender is unknown. 
**Type:** Symbol / Ritual

**Incident-6458-08**
**Location:** 429 ███ Avenue, Phoenix. 
**Cause:** SCP-6458 walks past a house playing &#34;Eye of the Tiger&#34; by Survivor, &#34;And he&#39;s watching us all with the eye of the tiger!&#34; 
**Event:** A mysterious figure, who seems to possess a singular eye belonging to that of a tiger, appears in the periphery of everyone within earshot of the song. Those affected later reported that though they were disturbed by the entity&#39;s presence, the entity did not appear hostile, and eventually demanifested approximately 10 minutes later. 
**Type:** Music 

**Incident-6458-09**
**Location:** SCP-6458&#39;s place of residence.
**Cause:** SCP-6458 asks for a favor from his roommate, &#34;Hey dude, could I catch a ride with you today? It&#39;s raining cats and dogs outside.&#34; 
**Event:** Varying breeds of canine and feline specimens begin to plummet from the sky, most if not all suffering immediate death upon impact with the ground. The incident persisted for the remainder of the night, resulting in numerous casualties from those caught outside in the phenomenon. 
**Type:** Metaphor

**Incident-6458-10**
**Location:** SCP-6458&#39;s Bedroom.
**Cause:** SCP-6458 engages in a conversation with his brother over the phone, &#34;Hey . . . hey man, I . . . I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening. At first I thought they were just coincidences but . . . sometimes, the things I say, they //happen//. I don&#39;t know how, I thought it was pretty cool at times, like when I wished for that vacation and actually won it, but . . . recently things have gotten out of hand.&#34; 
**Event:** Everyone within a 100 meter radius of SCP-6458, including SCP-6458 himself, drop whatever is currently being held in either of their hands.

**__Post-Containment Incident-Log-6458__**

**Incident-6458-11**
**Cause:** Operatives from MTF Iota-10 were sent to retrieve SCP-6458, working under the guise of local police. 
**Event:** SCP-6458, genuinely believing the operatives were policemen, inadvertently changes the agents into believing themselves that they are policemen. They proceed to transport SCP-6458 to the local police station, where he is taken in for questioning. SCP-6458 makes claims that he didn&#39;t try to cause the phenomena that have occurred, and that these events occur whenever he speaks. Attempts by SCP-6458 to prove his abilities fail, and SCP-6458 is kept in a standard jail cell. 
**Type:** Deception 

**Incident-6458-12**
**Cause:** MTF Lambda-5 (&#34;White Rabbits&#34;) is sent in to retrieve SCP-6458 after suspicions of SCP-6458 possessing reality-bending abilities are proven to be true. Unaffected Iota-10 operatives orchestrate SCP-6458&#39;s release, and MTF Lambda-5 attempt to contain him shortly after. 
**Event:** SCP-6458, upon being confronted by MTF Lambda-5 operatives, concludes that he is under attack. The Lambda-5 operatives, on account of their equipment, remain unaffected. However, approximately 3 minutes after SCP-6458 is detained, civilians begin to approach their location. The affected civilians make attempts at attacking SCP-6458, along with the Lambda-5 operatives attempting to prevent them from doing so. One of the civilians throws a brick at SCP-6458, striking him directly in the head and knocking him unconscious. The effect immediately halts and the civilians appear disoriented and confused. SCP-6458 claims to not remember the situation upon waking. 
**Type:** Comprehension  
**Additional:** It is uncertain whether the affect SCP-6458 had on the civilians ceased because the affected civilians had successfully attacked him, or because his memory of the situation had been affected.

**Incident-6458-13**
**Cause:** SCP-6458, still unconscious, has a dream during transport to the Foundation facility.
**Event:** Halfway during transport, the streets begins to crack open, and reanimated canine and feline specimens begin to emerge from the ground. The specimens then proceed to attack the Foundation vehicle, possessing anomalous strength allowing them to immediately tear through the vehicle&#39;s walls and ceiling. Most of the Lambda-5 operatives attempt to hold back the specimens while Lambda-5 Agent Jacob Wilder prepares SCP-6458 for evacuation. About 13 seconds after SCP-6458 wakes up, the specimens demanifest. 
**Type:** Dreams 
**Note:** This seems to confirm it, SCP-6458&#39;s abilities are tied to both his perception and his memory. It seems that the phenomena caused by SCP-6458 can be reversed if his memory of the cause of the event is erased.

**Incident-6458-14**
**Cause:** The Lambda-5 Team Lead, Alex A. Henderson, refers to SCP-6458 as &#34;Mr. Literal&#34; during a mission debriefing.
**Effect:** SCP-6458&#39;s identity is now &#34;Mr. Literal&#34; or &#34;Marcus Literal&#34; 
**Note:** The reason we are still able to refer to Marcus as SCP-6458 is likely because it is an identification number for an instance rather than a name. As such, they serve two different purposes and can both be used in different circumstances.
