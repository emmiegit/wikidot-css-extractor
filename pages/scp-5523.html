**Containment Update:** Following the incident involving Sid Rothenberg[[footnote]] Following contact with SCP-5523, Rothenberg is now refered to as SCP-5523-2. [[/footnote]], governments affiliated with the Foundation have enacted an indefinite ban on the hunting and consumption of //cervidaes// species. Rothenberg has been taken into Foundation custody, and is receiving intensive care.

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the ecological niche SCP-5523 facilitates, removal of SCP-5523-1 specimens from forested areas is prohibited.  Regions containing significant SCP-5523-1 populations have been cordoned from the public, with low-level security fences established around the perimeter of SCP-5523 affected areas.

**Description:** SCP-5523 is a Terminal[[footnote]] Originally referring to an entity or anomaly that incorporates human beings into it following death. Following the discovery of SCP-5523, it has been determined that animal specimens can be incorporated into Terminal anomalies. [[/footnote]]-Class group of environmental changes, consisting of behavioral modifications and biological mutations affecting members of the Cervidaes family.[[footnote]] A biological group consisting of Deers. [[/footnote]] SCP-5523 events have been observed to occur after periods of severe environmental damage, such as forest fires or times of drought.  SCP-5523 does not affect all individual Cervidaes specimens within a given area. Elderly populations or specific individuals experiencing sickness are more susceptible to developing SCP-5523 then young and healthy populations. SCP-5523 consists of the ingestion of //Vaccinium vitis-idaea//[[footnote]] Variously known as lingonberry, partridgeberry, mountain cranberry or cowberry. [[/footnote]] berries. //Vaccinium vitis-idaea// are typically not eaten by Cervidaes specimens, due to the individual berries containing toxic substances.

SCP-5523 affected individuals[[footnote]] Designated as SCP-5523-1 instances. [[/footnote]] ingest great quantities of //Vaccinium vitis-idaea//, in which the poisonous materials will accumulate within the individual&#39;s bloodstream. After a period of approximately fourty-two hours, the SCP-5523-1 instance will die, leading to rapid decomposition occuring, without assistance from maggots or other decomposer organisms. Skeletal remains will develop //Vaccinium vitis-idaea// saplings, along with spear-heading the growth of boreal plants, including Greenbrier, Poison Ivy, and Buckweed, all specimens of plants favored by Cervidaes. Following continued research, it has been determined that over ██ percent of forest growth worldwide has developed due to SCP-5523.

**Addendum No. 1:** Rothenberg Incident

Sid Rothenberg, a Canadian civilian, outdoorsman and biologist, experienced a period of confusion and delirium following ingestion of venison harvested from an SCP-5523-1 specimen. An outdoor journal, kept during the period of delirium, was recovered. The following is an excerpt.

&gt; I am sick. There is a sickness within my body, I feel it inside me. The simple explanation is maggots, improperly cooked meat. But I feel as if there is something more, something that can explain why my mind is repeating words to me. &#39;//Greenbrier.//&#39; &#39;//Poison Ivy.//&#39; &#39;//Buckweed.//&#39; Why are these words repeated to me? All speculation, at this point.

&gt;
&gt; I&#39;m resting by the fire, waiting for rescue. I&#39;m looking at the forest around me, hearing the rutting of elk, the cawing of crow. The howl of a wolf. Something is clear to me. The Earth is dying, and we do not notice. 
&gt; [[size 0%]]...[[/size]]
&gt;
&gt; I fell asleep by the light of the moon, and I dreamt of my death, my skeleton, my bones, growing across the forest, like the roots of a tree. My death will bring the forest green, and the earth as brown as the first people.
