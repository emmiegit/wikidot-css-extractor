**Item #:** SCP-4442

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4442 is contained along with the town of  ███████, Florida. All previous residents have been given Class-B amnestics and relocated, and all geographical records of the area since 1963 have been wiped or destroyed. 

The town was converted to a Foundation facility[[footnote]] Site-4442. [[/footnote]] in 1976 after Incident Digamma-874, and is currently used as an MTF barracks and training facility. All contact with SCP-4442 and its immediate vicinity is monitored closely by site staff. Up to 150 personnel can be on staff at one time, with the town functioning as a location to teach Tier I-III Defensive Driving courses.



**Description**: SCP-4442 is a four-way traffic stop in ███████, Florida. It is of standard construction for the time period.[[footnote]] The town had been last updated for traffic security in 1959. [[/footnote]] It uses one Crouse Hinds &#34;D&#34; type 4-way signal, with its signature &#34;Smiley Face&#34; lenses hung over the center of the intersection. Span wire is attached diagonally across the street to two utility poles six meters in height.

SCP-4442 continues to function as a normal four-way traffic light, in spite of it no longer having access to a power supply or the regular maintenance a unit of its age would require. SCP-4442&#39;s anomalous effects are triggered when a manned street legal vehicle passes directly underneath the signal; the driver of this vehicle will be designated SCP-4442-A for the duration of SCP-4442&#39;s effect. For the next 30 days, any moving violation to which SCP-4442-A is at fault will result in subjectively appropriate vandalism to SCP-4442-A&#39;s primary vehicle, designated SCP-4442-B. SCP-4442-B may not be the vehicle used to initiate the initial event, or even the vehicle currently registered to SCP-4442-A; rather, SCP-4442-B appears to be the vehicle to which SCP-4442-A is most emotionally attached at the time of crossing SCP-4442.


Any text produced by SCP-4442 is printed as matte black[[footnote]]SCP-4442 will not change the color of its text, even if the vehicle in question is black.[[/footnote]]  576-point Impact font directly on the outer body of the vehicle. Testing has shown that the severity of the vandalism is proportionate to the severity of the moving violation; additionally, statements manifested are personalized to the driver.[[footnote]]How SCP-4442 sources this personal information is currently unknown.[[/footnote]] For details, see addenda.

&gt; 

**Additional Notes:** Proper compensation was given and the vehicle repainted. Further investigation in regards to potential sapience is pending.

&gt; **Experiment 4442-███:**
&gt; 
&gt; **Date:** ██/██/███

&gt; **Subject:** D-99406
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-4442-B:** [REDACTED]

**Additional Notes:**  Decayed human remains were recovered from the coordinates given; all 15 individuals identified had been flagged as missing by law enforcement prior to this discovery. When interviewed, D-99406 disclosed that they had committed all 15 murders over the course of seven years. As they were never convicted for the murders,[[footnote]]Due to this fact, researchers concluded that SCP-4442&#39;s ability to detect past and current offenses does not function by anomalously accessing legal records, but rather by wholly unknown means.[[/footnote]] D-99406 was given the option of federal incarceration or extended service as D-class personnel. D-99406 was subsequently transferred to Biological Containment Site-66.
