**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-7173 manifestations are to be intercepted and stopped as quickly as possible.-- SCP-7173 performances are to be visited and kept secure by Foundation personnel, and Scranton Reality Anchors provided as necessary or requested by those involved. 

**Description:** SCP-7173 is a thaumaturgical ritual performed once every 236 days in Ljubljana, Slovenia. SCP-7173 is known to the public as a 1920s Yugoslav play called &#34;Not Centered in Truth [[footnote]]Translated from Slovenian[[/footnote]]&#34;. 

At exactly 13:22 local time, every 236 days, a group of eight actors will appear at a random location within the city of Ljubljana and perform SCP-7173 in full view of the public. SCP-7173 will appear to be a work of public street performance art, and so attracts little attention. Therefore, it does not pose any major risk to the veil by itself. 

During an SCP-7173 performance, a massive increase in Hume[[footnote]]A measurement of Reality. [[/footnote]] levels will occur, which is reversed shortly after the conclusion of the act. 

The actors in all SCP-7173 performances are identical and have had no change in appearance since the anomaly&#39;s identification by the Foundation in 1976. --All Foundation and civilian attempts to interact with the actors have so far failed.--

**Addendum 1: Discovery**

SCP-7173&#39;s anomalous nature was first noticed on August 24, 1976, after at least thirty-eight years of regular live performance. During a performance near the city center, an unusually large crowd of almost one hundred people gathered around to watch. 

Prior to this incident, SCP-7173 performances had been acted out in small spaces like building lobbies or alleyways, but this performance appeared unusually legitimate and eventually became a flash-mob with some civilians joining in. 

Shortly after the act, local authorities in Ljubljana became aware that eight people had disappeared from the flash-mob into seemingly thin air. This gained the attention of the national news across Yugoslavia[[footnote]] Slovenia was a component state of Yugoslavia at the time. [[/footnote]]. 

236 days later, on April 17, 1977, SCP-7173 was again performed by what appeared to be the same actors at  a road intersection near the center of the city. Several passersby informed local police, and embedded Foundation personnel arrived to intercept the re-appeared actors. However, upon arrival of Foundation personnel, SCP-7173&#39;s actors spontaneously demanifested. 

**Addendum 2: April 17, 2019 Incident** 

Until April 17, 2019, SCP-7173 continued to manifest regularly across Ljubljana every 236 days, with the actors demanifesting when finished, usually out of view of any civilians. Interestingly, when Foundation personnel were present, SCP-7173 was willing to demanifest in their view. 

On April 17, 2019, one SCP-7173 actor did not demanifest following a performance in a hotel lobby. One Foundation researcher, Dr. Konstantin Karrachev, was present. The actor approached Karrachev and specifically asked for an interview, which Karrachev granted. 

This actor was dubbed SCP-7173-1 and transported to Site-228, a Hungarian site specializing in Humanoid anomalies. 

**Addendum 3: Interview** 

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

[Start Log]

//SCP-7173-1 is sitting at one end of a table, Karrachev at the other. SCP-7173-1 holds his head in apparent pain or exhaustion.//

**SCP-7173-1:** The others have told me about you all, and honestly I just feel bad for you. 

**Dr. Karrachev:** Wait, usually I start the interview, not the subject. It&#39;s okay, tell me about the others. 

**SCP-7173-1:** Well, they&#39;re all pretty much like me. I don&#39;t know how much you know, is the problem. Tell me what //you// know about me. 

**Dr. Karrachev:** I know that you&#39;re participating in the performance of some kind of anomalous play that boosts the level of reality at a site. And that you can vanish into thin air. 

**SCP-7173-1:** I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re suggesting, doctor. It&#39;s not as if we have some &#34;powers&#34;, That said, I don&#39;t think you really understand at all. We aren&#39;t performing an anomalous play, the play is completely normal. It&#39;s just that we, shall I say, scratch reality a bit when we come back and we do a little routine during the play that buffs out that scratch. 

**Dr. Karrachev:** But why do you do this? What&#39;s your end goal and why does your appearance damage reality? 

**SCP-7173-1:** This is the problem with the Foundation&#39;s approach, no offense but you&#39;re all very paranoid. You expect some long plan, some scheme everywhere. There isn&#39;t. We&#39;re actors. And we tend to do a number on reality when we come back, because being immortal and teleporting in and out of a city can do that to you. 

**Dr. Karrachev:** I don&#39;t appreciate the sarcasm, SCP-7173-1. How did you become immortal? 

**SCP-7173-1:** And I don&#39;t appreciate the assumptions. I&#39;m not being sarcastic, I just haven&#39;t died or aged, I don&#39;t know why any more than you. We aren&#39;t doing anything, it&#39;s just that most like us //are//. Sure, I could&#39;ve joined one of your adversaries. But why would I? We like to promote peace and cultural understanding. If the others don&#39;t want to, that&#39;s their choice. But I&#39;ve seen enough of that in two hundred years of life in the Balkans. 

//SCP-7173 produces a small personal card with contact information for his group.//

[[/div]]

SCP-7173-1 was released. After calling the number on the card given to him by SCP-7173-1, Karrachev was able to collect significant details on the group. 

This group has been dubbed GoI-556, known officially as the &#34;Peace through Script Society&#34;. 

GoI-556 has maintained friendly relations with the Foundation. Scranton Reality Anchors have been provided to the group, allowing them to perform without the need to utilize thaumaturgy. 

GoI-556 made its first performance outside Ljubljana on March 3, 2022, performing SCP-7173 for children in a bomb shelter in Kyiv, Ukraine.
