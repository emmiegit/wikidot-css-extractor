**Special Containment Procedures:**

Scp-7244 is to be contained in a standard 7mx7m room. Scp-7244 should be on a pedestal, with bullet proof glass surrounding it, as to stop anyone from touching the cards. Nobody without permission from Level 3 or higher is permitted to enter the containment cell.

**Special Breakout Procedures:** 

All Chaos Insurgency Members are to wear mask to cancel out Scp-7244-3 effects. Chaos Insurgency Members are instructed to stay 10m away from any anomalous entities, and are to target the King and Queen. If anomalous entity Scp-7244-3 is spotted, they are to eliminate all other anomalous entities around Scp-7244-3, and are to call scientist to put it into containment to test or try to interrogate.    

Scp-7244, or &#39;King of Cards&#39;, is a blank pack of playing cards, which has no instant effects when touched by any individual or animal.
If pressure is put onto anywhere on the card, whomever put pressure on the card will be absorbed into the card. Once this is done, it will summon Scp-7244-1A (The King) and Scp-7244-1B (The Queen). The King and Queen have a similar appearance to the King and Queen on average set of playing cards. Anybody who is in a 5m - 7m radius of either Scp-7244-1A or 1B will become a card, and then about 40 seconds later, will become a sort of knight, following a similar style to the King and Queen. The Knights are called Scp-7244-2, which have the same effect, but the radius is halved. There is a small chance, about 1.3%, that a card, instead of becoming Scp-7244-2, will take form of &#39;The Joker&#39;, or Scp-7244-3. Only one Joker can exist at a time, and if the Joker is killed, a new one can now be summoned. A new Joker still has the memories and personality as the previous one. The Joker lacks most facial features, with a face taking form as a sort of mask, with two black holes for eyes and one large black hole for a mouth. They also wear a jester costume. Researchers have noted that The Joker is completely safe, and in fact, take a disliking to the King and Queen. The Joker makes anyone in a 5m - 7m radius laugh uncontrollably. Researchers have yet to find The Joker to co-operate into a interview. Through previous testing, it has been shown that Scp-7244-3 is impervious to pain.

On ██/██/██, at Site-██, while testing was in action, a D-Class snuck 3-5 cards from the pack into his cell. He started to write on the cards with a smuggled in sharpie, so he could entertain himself, he accidentally put pressure on the card. This caused an outbreak that lasted 14 hours. This is the first time Scp-7244 was put in action, which caused the SCP Foundation to contain Scp-7244 more securely. 

Scp-7244&#39;s entry will be updated when we are able to interrogate Scp-7244-3.
