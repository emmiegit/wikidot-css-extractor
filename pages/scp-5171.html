**Item #:** SCP-5171

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** All photonics processing and storage units associated with SCP-5171 and SCP-5171-A are to be vacuum-sealed and stored in secure containment lockers. Testing of SCP-5171 is currently suspended.

Locating PoI-9414 has been assigned as a priority mission for MTF Alpha-7 (&#34;Surpassing Tindalos&#34;).

**Description:** SCP-5171 is an artificial intelligence built by PoI-9414, formerly O5-9, as an administrative assistance and memetic screening system. SCP-5171 operated on a 3rd-gen photonics processing platform allocated for all Level 5 personnel at the time, with heavily modified interfaces. While these technologies are ahead of mundane equivalents, no part of SCP-5171 was inherently anomalous at the time of its creation.

Originally designated Rhyme.aic, SCP-5171 had developed total self-awareness after PoI-9414 intentionally exposed it to a multitude of anomalous memetic agents, collectively designated SCP-5171-A. It is currently unknown how PoI-9414 acquired the skills necessary to create and utilize anomalous memetic agents in this way. While the Foundation retains a full copy of SCP-5171-A, the technical and ethical risk posed prohibits further experimentation.

According to the log recovered after PoI-9414 defected from the Foundation (see Addendum 5171.A), SCP-5171 believed that it was a human female named &#34;Rima&#34;, and that it had grown up with PoI-9414 since their childhood. Due to the mandatory data expungement procedure applied to the personal data of O5 members, this information cannot be confirmed.

**Addendum 5171.A:** Log recovered from SCP-5171 interface cache, temporal metadata irretrievable. The format indicates a speech-recognition interface log.

&gt; **PoI-9414:** Hello Rima, how are you today?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5171:** Hi, Galuh. I was wondering when you&#39;ll show up.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-9414:** I&#39;m so sorry, the meeting got late, I kept getting in arguments with those pesky fossils.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5171:** No, don&#39;t be. I shouldn&#39;t have talked to you like that, I know you&#39;re very busy, and it&#39;s for both of us. It&#39;s just that sitting here all day with nothing to do...it got me all grumpy, you know? [[footnote]] Of note, SCP-5171 had never ceased functioning as administrative assistance and memetic screening system, up until its deactivation upon PoI-9414&#39;s defection. [[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-9414:** I know. I&#39;m sorry, I wish I could&#39;ve brought you outside.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5171:** Like I said, don&#39;t be sorry. None of this is your fault, I&#39;m thankful that you had time to spend with me at all.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-9414:** But I could&#39;ve done more, if only I stopped trying to fight my way through every little thing.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-9414:** If only I listened to your parents back then.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5171:** We&#39;re not having this conversation, Galuh.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Strings of periodic data pattern follows, with no known meaning. Presumed to be environmental noise falsely parsed as speeches by the interface.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5171:** Do you remember when we watched meteor showers on the beach?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-9414:** That was so long ago, I&#39;m surprised that you still remember it.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5171:** There&#39;s no way I would forget. We spent a full roll of your dad&#39;s camera film. All those photographs, I could recall every single one of them as if it&#39;s yesterday.[[footnote]] A large portion of SCP-5171-A incorporate photographs, often collages arranged in certain patterns. It is theorized that these photographs affected the memory retained by SCP-5171. [[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-9414:** I was so sure he&#39;d be so angry at me. Those rolls were expensive. Instead, he started teaching me how to properly photograph a shooting star.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5171:** I tried to convince you that he won&#39;t be angry at us for using a camera //to take pictures.// But you&#39;re just so convinced he would.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5171:** Oh wow, he&#39;s not angry that you used something for its intended purpose, how surprising.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-9414:** When do you think was the last time I started a conversation //without// fighting intent?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5171:** Other than with me? I&#39;d wager a decade at least.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-9414:** ...okay I&#39;m not //that// controversial. I could hold a somewhat proper and neutral conversation with my subordinates.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5171:** I wouldn&#39;t know, I never had any reason to meet them.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5171:** Not that I want to, mind you. But it just feels so bizarre thinking about you having just normal conversations about accounting or something.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5171:** Hell, I can&#39;t even imagine //the// Galuh arguing academically against a Board of Directors!
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-9414:** Yeah, I guess I changed quite a bit since way back then.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5171:** Me, on the other hand...
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-9414:** Sorry.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5171:** Sorry sorry sorry. Half your words are apology, over and over again. I didn&#39;t wake up just to hear you say sorry for days on end!
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-9414:** I...
&gt; 
&gt; //(brief periodic data/silence, gaps in noise pattern indicate removed data)//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-9414:** Did you meet the doctors today?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5171:** Nope, there&#39;s no test for today. I wonder if that means I&#39;m getting better or getting worse.[[footnote]] The nature and significance of these alleged &#34;tests&#34; and &#34;doctors&#34; is unknown. [[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-9414:** Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll be out of this place in no time.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5171:** I wouldn&#39;t hold my breath.
