[[include component:image-block name=SCP_JET|caption=SCP-6315, obscured behind Huka Falls; image taken on 01/06/2013.|width=300px]]

**Item #:** SCP-6315

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation web crawlers are to search sites  for SCP-6315 advertisements and suppress them. Any persons of interest tied to Jetboat Sights and Adventures (JSA) and that have obtained knowledge of SCP-6315 are to be detained and interrogated. Amnestics are then to be administered based on the severity of knowledge gained from SCP-6315.

All tourist destinations that included tours of Huka Falls have been relocated under the guise of permanent maintenance. Drones and guards are to be used as surveillance to locate any trespassers entering the 430km² exclusion zone. Trespassers entering the exclusion zone are to be turned away immediately. Roads connected to the exclusion zone are to be closed and rerouted, and any tourist destinations within the exclusion zone are to be relocated.

All logs pertaining to SCP-6315 and its contents are to be logged in [[span class=&#34;hover&#34;]][[span class=&#34;hover-text&#34;]]Addendum unavailable, please try again later[[/span]]Addendum 6315-B.[[/span]] Due to Incident-6315, future expeditions of SCP-6315 are to be conducted using Foundation equipment, including transportation and drivers. All personnel must be armed.

**Description:** SCP-6315 is a spatial anomaly located within Huka Falls of Taupo, New Zealand, consisting of an approximately 3 metre diameter multiversal passageway that is obfuscated by the waterfall.  The company responsible for the former operation of this dimensional passageway, JSA, utilized armed and custom made &#39;Jet Boats&#39; to traverse SCP-6315.

SCP-6315 consists of three points of interest, designated SCP-6315-1 through -3 respectively. These locations have been routinely described in witness accounts collected from the tourism website TripAdvisor.

Foundation personnel are yet to enter SCP-6315 and no formal expeditions have been planned. The following are witness statements collected from said website:

&gt; The waterfall was absolutely terrifying, not only was the water crashing down on the boat, but there were pieces of wood and small rocks crashing against the armored windows as well. Only thing that made it bearable was Bennet, he was so calm and even jovial during the ordeal, cracking jokes and smiling to everybody-Thersea, ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐


&gt;  &#34;You want the ride of your life?&#34; I certainly got the ride of my life! When the boat went through the portal and into that stupid tall cave (TARDIS, maybe? :p), that&#39;s when I knew I was going to have the most fun I had in NZ this year! Highly recommend it for all ages! Do beware, the Creature Collection can be a little scary for toddlers out there, recommend you let Bennet know, he&#39;s very understanding about it. -Micheal, ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐


&gt;  I highly recommend that you adhere to the safety warnings with this ride. You are going to experience a lot of thrashing about, especially after the Creature Collection, where that river system throws itself for a loop back into the cave. I also recommend keeping hold on tight, they do not f**k around with the thrill part of the ride. Apart from that, I would recommend this! And if the CEO himself rides with us, that just shows how good it must be! - Theodore, ⭐⭐⭐⭐

[[include component:image-block name=SCP_JET_ARTICLE_2|caption= One article referencing SCP-6315, highlighting its ties to the entertainment industry; article archived 21/08/13.|width=300px]]







Due to the public nature of SCP-6315 and its associates, the Foundation is currently investigating JSA and its subdivisions. During the investigation, multiple articles relating to JSA were discovered. All articles referenced JSA&#39;s ties to the entertainment industry, public domains, and popular figures. Further research has revealed that JSA employs approximately 200 workers across its subsidiaries, with its biggest pool of employees being JSA&#39;s Huka Falls attraction.


The Foundation has focused its efforts on investigating the validity of these articles and JSA&#39;s company stocks, history, subsidiaries, and ties to the entertainment industry. These efforts have been placed under the command of MTF Theta-14: &#34;Stock Brokers&#34;.


**Addendum:** On the 11/08/2014, under the guise of an interview for a media outlet, Foundation Researcher Namid Maziar contacted the CEO of JSA, Jack Bennet, for an interview regarding systemic fraud affecting multiple companies at the time. The following is a transcript of the interview.

**Video Interview: Interview-6315**


**Interviewer:** Namid Maziar (under pseudonym Sere Nifty)

**Interviewee:** Jack Bennet

**&lt;Begin Log, 11/08/2014 9:05&gt;**

//Video starts as Namid adjusts his microphone, standing in the interview room//

**Namid Maziar:** Can we use wireless mics for once? It&#39;s like a web of wires under here.

//The door opens and Bennet walks inside, dressed in a yellow pinstripe suit, with matching shoes. A watch is present on his right hand. The man notices Namid and approaches him//

**Jack Bennet:** Hey! Apologies for being late, had to move a meeting around.

**Namid Maziar:** That’s alright, you got here when you did. Thanks for taking time out for us.

//Bennet sticks out his hand//

**Jack Bennet:** How about a formal introduction, then?

//Jack chuckles. Namid chuckles back and shakes hands//

**Namid Maziar:** Have a seat.

**Jack Bennet:** Of course.

//Both men take their seats at the interview table. Namid takes out a notepad//

**Namid Maziar:** The reason for this interview was for the strings of fraud that have hit New Zealand the past couple of weeks. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve heard, but it&#39;s not good.

//Jacks expression shifts to concern//

**Jack Bennet:** Fuck, really? Pardon my language, that’s not good at all. What happened?

**Namid Maziar:** Yeah, it isn’t. We’ve had a few companies hit with it. FireWire, New Zealand Family Adventures, Marlos Fisheries, and the latest one was NZ Jetboating.

//Jacks demeanor shifts, leaning over the interview table, a concerned expression on his face//

**Namid Maziar:** And we wanted to ask you a few questions to help clear things up, if that’s okay with you.

**Jack Bennet:** Y-yeah, of course, ask me anything. I’m an open book.

//Namid raises an eyebrow//

**Namid Maziar:** Very well. Let&#39;s get the obvious out of the way, first. Name, Date of Birth, and Occupation.

**Jack Bennet:** That’s easy enough. Jack Bennet, born on the 1st of March, 1990, and I am the CEO of Jetboats Sights and Adventures.

//Namid nods//

**Namid Maziar:** And what is it you do at Jetboat Sights and Adventures, or JSA?

**Jack Benner:** I mainly take care of matters regarding the departments below me, meeting with investors, and taking care of my main attraction, the Huka Adventure Ride, something I would call my child if I could!

//Jack chuckles, but then quickly recomposes himself//

**Jack Bennet:** But, yeah, I just do those things.

**Namid Maziar:** And you usually spend your time at the office?

**Jack Bennet:** No, not anymore. I’m usually around the Huka Adventure Ride, riding with guests, and making sure everything is going off without a hitch

//Namids expression changes to confusion//

**Namid Maziar:** You... ride it?

//Jack tilts his head to the side//

**Jack Bennet:** Yeah, if I don’t ride it for myself, then I don’t know if everything is running smoothly. And the guests love it, too! I think having the CEO ride with them makes it more personal, and it helps when things don’t go so good.

**Namid Maziar:** You’ve had incidents there, before?


**Jack Bennet:** No, nothing major enough for an ambulance call. We’ve had little kids cry in the Creature Collection, but I could help smooth things out. Of course, after the review was posted, I made sure to update the safety standards as well.

**Namid Maziar:** Reviews?

**Jack Bennet:** Yeah, I always check reviews to make sure things are alright. I saw one where they recommended toddlers shouldn’t ride it due to the animals we have, so I upped the age rules to tweenish, I think that’s around 10-11 minimum. After that, one guest wasn’t sure the safety standards were clear enough, so I sunk some money into safety guidelines, online and offline, of course. Would be disappointing if you couldn’t ride something because you didn’t know about their safety standards, 6 Flags kept doing that, and now they’re ranked one of the lowest worldwide.

//Namid scribbles down some notes, and then looks up at Jack//


**Namid Maziar:** That is a lot of information there. I am wondering, do you coerce your guests into leaving positive reviews? Incentives, rewards, or whatnot?

**Jack Bennet:** Oh god, no! I would never do that to my guests. That’s guilt tripping, and that just makes things worse!

**Namid Maziar:** How so?


**Jack Bennet:** Think of it this way, if a positive review is the only thing you get, you don’t get criticism, and if it’s something a lot of people don’t like, then you’ve lost. You can’t keep going and improving without feedback, and that is crucial. I always tell guests whenever they say they’ll leave a review: ‘If you wanna write a review, write the good and the bad! It helps us improve this even more for all of your enjoyment!&#39;

//Jack takes a deep breath//

**Jack Bennet:** I love my job, I really do. I want to make sure everyone is okay, safe, and enjoying all that I do. It’s why I’m in the entertainment industry, helping people like Spielberg, Micheal Bay, or even just being outsourced to help with blockbusters. I love to entertain people, and I wouldn’t know what to do if I lost all of that. I promise you, I’ll report anything from our company, whether that’s suspicious transactions, scams, or anything like that to the proper authorities.

//Namid nods//

**Namid Maziar** Wow, okay then..

//Jacks expression changes to flustered//

**Jack Bennet:** Yeah, I sometimes get a bit passionate about these things. My company is like my baby, I love it to bits, and would never want to lose it.

//Namids expression turns solemn//

**Namid Maziar:** I can relate to that, you just want to keep everything close to you, even if something ends up breaking it. It’s like that sometimes, isn’t it?

**Jack Bennet:** Yeah, it is. But, we can always keep moving forward, can’t we?

//Namid smiles//

**Namid Maziar:** Yeah, we can.

//Namid begins to stand from his seat, Jack follows suit. Namid approaches Jack and sticks his hand out//

**Namid Maziar:** Thank you for your time, Mr. Bennet

**Jack Bennet:** The pleasure&#39;s mine.


**&lt;End Log, 9:48&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** On 17/08/2014, JSA made multiple public statements relating to their Jetboat attraction. These statements consisted organizing an event consisting of &#34;Behind the Scenes&#34; looks into their attraction, and how they are able to achieve realistic special effects. Due to the overwhelming breach of secrecy and containment that this event would create, the Foundation was approved to enact countermeasures. On 25/08/2014, the Foundation enacted a suppression campaign against Jack Bennet and JSA, effectively removing approximately 99.89% of income and tourism over the course of 8 months.

UPDATE 15/05/2015: Due to Incident-6315, containment procedures have been updated accordingly. MTF Theta-14 have been cooped by MTF Alpha-28: &#34;Hunt and Capture&#34; in efforts to track and locate CEO Jack Bennet.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Video Log: Incident-6315**


**Foundation Personnel:** Namid Maziar

**Other Persons:** Jack Bennet, Julie Bennet

**Foreword:** Namid has been placed undercover as a tourist to observe and record the current state of JSA and its tourist attraction. Due to the malfunction of Foundation equipment, audio from Foundation researchers communicating with Namid has been lost.

**&lt;Begin Log, 15/05/2015 13:09&gt;**

//Video starts as Namid enters the boat, fastening the provided safety belts and life jackets//

**Namid Maziar:** These jackets are always too small. Why did the lady think I was an extra small?

//A male voice is heard out of frame. The camera pans to a man of average height. The man is wearing a yellow striped suit, with brown dress pants. A watch is observed on his right wrist//

**Jack Bennet:** Hey there, mind if I join ya?

//A 2 second pause was recorded//

**Jack Bennet:** Oh! Didn&#39;t mean to scare ya! I&#39;m Jack, Jack Bennet.

//Jack sticks his arm out, offering to shake. Namid obliges//

**Namid Maizar:** Namid...

**Jack Bennet:** My apologies for the intrusion and scare. I&#39;m the CEO of the company, not many get to see me.

//Jack points to the frame of the camera fastened to Namids helmet//

**Jack Bennet:** But with that GoPro, guess that&#39;s flying out the window, huh?


//Jack chuckles, before his expression changes to solemnity//


**Jack Bennet:** But then again, not many people come here anymore.


//[30 seconds of extraneous data removed for brevity]//


**Jack Bennet:** Alright, we ready to go?

//The camera pans to a female Attendant, who is piloting the vessel. The name tag on the Attendants shirt reads &#39;Julie Bennet&#39;//

**Julie Bennet:** Ready!

**Jack Bennet:** Then let&#39;s go!


//The camera captures the vessel lurching forward and climbing upwards to approximately 50 knots. The vessel travels closer to the waterfall before crashing through, entering SCP-6315 and into SCP-6315-1//

 
**Namid Maziar:** Holy shit holy shit HOLY SHIIII-


//Audio is unintelligible and distorted for 2 minutes due to screams emanating from Namid. The camera captures the vessel edging the side of SCP-6315-1, until it skims over the surface of SCP-6315 and skims down the side of the cave system. The camera shakes and lurches with tight corners and and steep drops. Multiple sources of light are seen throughout the cave system, and frame scrubbing reveals multiple pit stops constructed throughout. After 2 minutes, the vessel lurches to the left and exits the cave system, pulling to a stop in a calm ocean//


**Jack Bennet:** Yes! This is what I&#39;m talking about! Who would want to miss out on this? That rush of adrenaline is what makes it all worth it!

//The camera pans to Jack, capturing the expression of joy on his face//

**Jack Bennet:** Alright, let&#39;s head to the Creature Collection! We got some wonderful stuff in there! Once Namid here can get his head straight, I think he&#39;s a little out of it.

//The camera pans to the side of the boat, the water shown to be a shade of purple, with unknown bio-luminescence material giving it the property of glowing//


**Jack Bennet:** Oh yeah, you wondering about the water? Purple is it&#39;s natural colour, we&#39;re still testing to see if we can swim in it. If it passes the regulations, we&#39;ll have ourselves our own exotic pool. Without the big fish, of course!

//Jack chuckles out of frame//


//[4 minutes of extraneous data removed for brevity]//

//The camera pans around the inside of SCP-6315-2, low lighting causing low visibility in the video feed. Editing in post reveals a large containment facility with an artificial river constructed within. On both sides of the river cages and enclosures for various species of animals are seen. It is noted that these species of animals were originally found in earlier iterations of the attraction, and therefore were not available to the public. After 30 seconds, the camera pans and focuses on a large, malformed mammal. A large horn protrudes from the animals snout. Fur covers all parts of the animal with the exception of the tail, which is seen to be made of bone. The fur is seen to stand on end when the vessel nears. The animal snarls.//


**Jack Bennet:** //Boari rattus//, the horned rat. That thing can tear anyone apart in mere seconds, and is highly aggressive to boot. Could tear apart a grown man in seconds.

//The camera turns to Jacks face, which has contorted into a stretched smile//

**Jack Bennet:**  And I could release it right now. It would be fun to try and not get eaten, wouldn&#39;t it?

//After a 4 second pause, Jack begins to laugh, loud enough to distort audio for 9 seconds//


**Jack Bennet:** Okay, okay, I&#39;m not that cruel! That&#39;s just a part of the show. We wanted to make it more thrilling, so we found some more dangerous animals, some even from the early days! You know what it&#39;s like, I bet you&#39;ve seen your fair share of deadly and unexplained things.

//An uncomfortable, intelligible murmur is heard from Namid//


**Jack Bennet:** That&#39;s the spirit! Julie, my darling, let&#39;s speed things up! Give Namid something he&#39;ll never forget!

//The camera captures the vessel powering and lurching to a speed of 65 knots. The noise of the engines distort audio for 9 minutes. The sudden change from darkness to bright sunlight causes video feed to become destabilized for 8 seconds due to overexposure of the lens. SCP-6315-3 is observed to be navigated through. Stabilization of the video in post calculated the vessel and persons on board were experiencing forces of 5-7 Gs//

//[45 seconds of extraneous data removed for brevity]//

//The camera pans to Julie Bennet. The vessel slows down to a complete stop, near the presumed place where Bennet described a large carnivorous fish breaching the water and chasing the vessel.//

**Namid Maizer:** Wait, aren&#39;t we meant to run from something?


**Jack Bennet:** Hm? Run from what?


**Namid Maizer:** Wasn&#39;t there a fish? I saw them in the adverts!

//The camera captures surprise from Jack, before an expression of anger, then neutral appear. Jack unbuckles his safety belt and stands up.//


**Jack Bennet:** Well, we were going to have a fun trip where a giant fish chases us back to the Tulip Rocks. But, simply, we ran out of budget. And it&#39;s funny you should say that, while I like to please my guests the best I can, I&#39;m going to make an exception just this once.

//Bennet leans into the camera//


**Jack Bennet:** You are no guest of mine.


//Namid immediately stands and Jack snatches Namids left arm, twisting and pinning it to his back. The camera is twisted away from Jack, facing the river mouth of SCP-6315-3//

**Jack Bennet:** Don&#39;t push your luck, especially with a gun to your head.

//Sounds of a struggle are heard for approximately 15 seconds, the camera shaking and obscuring the view of the struggle. After 20 seconds, the camera is twisted to face Jack. Bruises can be seen on his face and wrists, the watch cracked.//

**Jack Bennet:** Ah...ahh...

//Jacks recomposes himself, and his expression turns to remorse. Jack bends down and stares into the camera//

**Jack Bennet:** I wish I could say sorry about all this. But, I can&#39;t, not after what you did. You know who you are. You thought I was an idiot? You thought you could destroy everything I built?


//Jack reaches towards the camera and removes it from the helmet. The camera is held at a 45 degree angle, aiming at Jack and Namid, who is observed to be restrained with safety belts//

**Jack Bennet:** I&#39;m not mad about all of it. Well, I am, but I&#39;ve tucked those feelings away, gotta focus on the now instead of the past. I can, however, feel other things. Remorse, guilt for what I&#39;m doing and what I am going to do, and even the feeling of vengeance. But, I know that&#39;s not what you want from me. You&#39;d rather have me go on and on about how I&#39;m gonna get my revenge and how much I&#39;m gonna kill all of you.

//The camera is turned and pointed to Julie Bennet//

**Jack Bennet:** Hey darling, keep an eye on Namid. And if he tries to move or escape, shoot.

**Julie Bennet:** You got it, sweetie.

//Jack hands the firearm to Julie, and takes her position as pilot of the vessel. The camera is placed and affixed onto a railing. Jack is in the centre of the frame, the pilots chair obscuring the background.//

**Jack Bennet:** I&#39;m going to be real with you. You&#39;ve hurt me enough already. I&#39;ve had to cut staff shifts, I slashed my salary by half to keep my company afloat. I didn&#39;t want any of this. I didn&#39;t want to wage a war against you. I didn&#39;t want to take such drastic measures against a malicious entity.

//A 5 second pause was recorded//


**Jack Bennet:** But, you forced my hand. After you fucked with my livelihood. You could have just stopped at the advertisements, but you didn&#39;t. Our stock prices plummeted, our audience went down from 15,000 a year to 10. We were crashing into the ground, and I was the one piloting it. You put me under so much stress, you made my life hell for over eight months. Eight fucking months of hell. Do you know what that feels like? You don&#39;t, obviously. None of you are in my shoes, nor are you ever going to be. This is just normal to you. Snuff a life here, ruin one there. Make a front company, boil the competition till they fucking explode! It&#39;s normal to you, and that&#39;s the fucked up thing! In the real world, this isn&#39;t normal. Companies just don&#39;t commit corporate espionage whenever they fucking feel like it, and it&#39;s disgusting that you decided to resort to shit like this.


//Jack pauses and takes a deep breath. A gunshot is heard off frame, and then footsteps.//

**Julie Bennet:** He broke free.

**Jack Bennet:** Alright, that&#39;s okay. Just prep the body for now.

//Julie nods and walks out of frame//

**Jack Bennet:** Christ, I warned him. I fucking warned him. T-that&#39;s another thing about all of you. You never cease to give up. You just didn&#39;t stop at fucking me over, you decided to put an undercover fuckwit through this thing and think all would be hunky dory. And like, I know that you&#39;ve sent others through here, I&#39;m not stupid, I know what hidden cameras look like, I work in the fucking entertainment industry! You had dozens of people go through and I just smiled and waved. I&#39;ve known you people for a while, it&#39;s not hard to see the same behaviours and mannerisms of people who do exciting stuff as a day job, I do it as well. But, things can go wrong. And what&#39;s gone wrong for you, is a direct result of what you did to me. I&#39;m a compassionate and empathetic man, I was patient, I waited a full eight months to see what would happen, if you stopped. I was going to forgive you, and it would have been water under the bridge. But you didn&#39;t.

//The camera is grasped by Jack, and is held at arm&#39;s length. Jacks expression is cold//

**Jack Bennet:** After that, you don&#39;t deserve forgiveness.

//The camera is tossed into the water, video and audio distortions disrupting all incoming visual and audio data for 6 seconds. The feed cuts out.//
