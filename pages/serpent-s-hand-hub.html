For example: &#34;The Thirteenth-Made Rain Staff of Knight Charlotte Elsewood&#34; to describe a particular famed rain staff.

**Conspectus**

//This is a short general summary for the article&#39;s subject. This should also provide the __context__ for the reader of the article; if it is a triviality, or has multiverse-wide implications; if it is friendly, or dangerous, or ethereal, or anything else, it can be noted here. The conspectus can be told in story form, so long as the story also serves as a summary. It should be kept to 1-3 short paragraphs. --M.S.//

//Basically what she&#39;s saying is you don&#39;t need to use Neutral Point of View. We&#39;re not Wikipedia. This summary is partly about **How We See This Thing.** Sometimes this can be written like a fable, sorta like those old bestiaries that talk about how the animals fit morally into creation, that kind of thing. --I.J.//

//If you&#39;re writing about a sapient entity or a People, remember to be appropriately respectful. Like all the books tell us, words have power. --Q.R.//

**Knowledge**
[[/=]]

//This section should have the gathered information we&#39;re reasonably sure about, and analysis of it.[[footnote]]Footnotes may be used liberally, and will automatically be displayed at the bottom of the document. Annotations may be made this way as well.[[/footnote]] For animals, plants, and suchlike, style may resemble that of a field guide. --Q.R.//

//Throughout the document, remember to treat sapient individuals or Peoples with respect, especially if they are also fellow Hand members or associated individuals. One approach to take is how an encyclopedia would approach notable or public figures; with neutrality, but reporting major events, public organizational involvement, and common points of view. Of course, also recall that there are sapient individuals who prey on other sapient individuals, and respect for a monstrous predator still entails calling them a monstrous predator. Conversely, do not assume every individual of a People prone to predation is a predator.  --Q.R.// 

**Traits:** //Describe physical appearance. List notable characteristics. Ensure that all preternatural or otherwise unusual characteristics are noted; how an apparatus works (and primary uses or abilities), unusual biology, what the famed magical abilities of a notable figure are like. If characteristics are ordinary, briefly note this as well. This section can be long, or short. --Q.R.//

//For apparatuses and designed objects, remember to explain craftsmanship. Note if handmade/forged/summoned(ritual)/machined (if separate pieces were made with different processes, list all of applicable).// 
//Elemental incorporation: what kind of raw materials with elemental affinities are incorporated in significant amounts into the making of the item?//
//Also specify a focus or foci: one specific component that is key to the function or making of the item.//
//--Z.S.//

**Nature:** //&#34;Nature&#34; can be often thought of as &#34;Usual Behavior&#34;. Describe how the subject acts in particular situations, or how it generally functions. For animals and the like, this is simply their behavior. For spells or phenomena, this can describe quirks in how they manifest. For machines, how they operate.//
//For sapient entities, this section can note group divergence from expected patterns, or how a specific individual is remembered.//
//If this section has nothing worth noting, as for inanimate or nonfunctional objects or unique events, write &#34;Ordinary&#34;.//
//--Q.R.//

//For objects and apparatuses with forms of sapience/sentience, pay special attention to Loyalty. Loyalty is how well the subject’s effects will manifest when used by different people.//
* //Steadfast = effects will only manifest for one individual at a time (must be passed on willingly if new custodian)//
* //Predestined = effects will manifest for only one predetermined individual (common with commissions)//
* //Competence = effects will manifest for any individual with a certain level of ability or talent//
* //Trial = effects will manifest for any individual who has completed a challenge specific to the item, required to unlock the capabilities of the apparatus (can involve carrying the item for a length of time, besting the previous custodian in a duel, or even killing the previous custodian)//
* //Unfixed = effects will manifest for any individual//
//--Z.S.//

**History &amp; Associated Parties:** //Origin of subject, if known. Series of past events pertaining to the subject. Notable events that the subject was involved in, or connected to. Regarding associated parties: List information on significant friendly entities, as well as enemies and relationships with other associated entities and groups. --Q.R.//

//For apparatuses and designed objects: Add name of creator, if known. Note if this was a special commission.//
//For locations, note involvement of individuals or groups in shaping it, if any.//
//Note Custodian if applicable. If an individual (due to age, fragility, etc.) or location or other subject is in the active care, protection, or possession of another individual, that individual is the custodian. If there is no custodian, but there could or should be, note there is no custodian. --Z.S.//

**Approach:** //This tells you what you need to know to safely or correctly interact with the subject[s] of the article. Note how to deal with strengths and vulnerabilities of subject if applicable. Any information you need to know regarding safe handling, polite communication, correct rituals, or anything else of the sort. **Knowledge is safety as well as power.** --Q.R.//

//A few traditional examples://
//&#34;Don&#39;t ever say thank you to a mounds fairy...&#34;// 
//&#34;Nature of Old Ravenna changes based on time of day and year...&#34;//
//&#34;Don&#39;t bother blue aerie torchbugs at night...&#34;//
//&#34;Blow three kisses into the cauldron...&#34;//
//--I.J.//

//Feel free to re-emphasize already noted information, though please don&#39;t use ALL CAPITAL LETTERS or get goofy with your format. One of our early entries was enchanted to have an animated rainbow monster jump out at the viewer and scream a garbled message followed with &#34;AT ALL COSTS!&#34;. The article&#39;s author was not very popular after that. --I.J.//

//Remember to note if applicaple://
//Invocations: words or phrases that when spoken aloud have a consistently observed and predictable (or semi-predictable) effect on the subject//
//Handling: how to treat a subject when using it; how to behave around certain entities or locations//
//Maintenance: how to keep objects or apparatuses in good condition, information on any cleaning/rituals to follow upon entering or exiting locations//
//Tools change stories each time they change hands. Remembering stories deepens bonds. Honor your tools, and they will honor you.//
//--Z.S.//

//Include &#34;Accommodations&#34; for sapient beings with unusual requirements, as well as guidelines for respectful interaction. Remember that anomalous persons should be treated like people -- because they are people. --I.J.//

**Other Detail:** //List anything that does not fall into another section. --Q.R.//

//In this section, include field notes, anecdotes, stories that you have to tell and stories that others have to tell. Note if it&#39;s something you saw yourself and sign your name/title/initials. Put stories and notes in attached or linked documents if the article is getting too long. Short is okay too, if you don&#39;t know much other information to put here; other collaborators can add more material later![[footnote]]Also, footnote annotations are still a good thing![[/footnote]] --I.J.//

//Also, other authors may add their points of view on the subject (subject to community curation!) or contradict information provided above.

//Please note that this particular documentation style incorporates magical elements taken from formats used by the Archivists of the Wanderers&#39; Library, notably from documents released for patron use by Jericho Benalsh, 7th Chief Archivist of the Library (such as [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/thearchivistslog A Treatise Upon Those Of Knowledge] and [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/the-wandering-boy Lost Wanderers]).//

//As these magical elements provide certain aetherial protections, we encourage Hand members to consider making use of this style. While there are several competing documentation styles already in popular usage, this style is ideal for publicly accessible information, for it should lead to less harm if the information falls into the hands of those who wish malice upon the writers and subjects of our pieces.//

//Remember to add additional seals for information that is particularly sensitive to vulnerable parties, but try to hide as little as possible. We have a responsibility to all to tell as much as we know, even to our enemies. Only by the light of knowledge may even the worst of us finally step out of the darkness of cruelty and fear.//

SCP FOUNDATION INTRODUCTORY FILE ON GROUP OF INTEREST ALPHA-019, &#34;SERPENT&#39;S HAND&#34;

---------------

The Serpent&#39;s Hand is a small but formidable organization which seems to be growing at a rapid rate, and is responsible for a number of security breaches.

The group embraces the use and existence of paranormal items, and in particular embraces humanoid and sapient SCP objects. The Serpent&#39;s Hand has been highly vocal in criticizing the containment and destruction of these SCPs, especially those which are not particularly destructive.

At least one hundred and seventy-seven individuals belonging to the Serpent&#39;s Hand have been identified, of which several dozen have taken part in raids on Foundation facilities, many of whom used anomalous items for infiltration purposes. 

The total number of members belonging to this organization is unknown, as is their level of technology, number of possible SCPs held, or total level of threat. It is clear they are highly coordinated and often dangerous. Their numbers appear to be increasing faster as more anomalies appear in the world.

The Serpent&#39;s Hand came to Foundation attention after encounters with the individual known as L.S., who seems to be a leader within the Serpent&#39;s Hand, and is personally responsible for two security breaches in Foundation sites. 

L.S.&#39;s first breach resulted in the theft of [[[SCP-268]]], an artifact that the Foundation had recovered during a raid of a Chaos Insurgency facility. The Foundation first learned of the Serpent&#39;s Hand after L.S.&#39;s second breach of Foundation security (see [[[incident-report-x23| Security Breach Incident X23/Site-19]]]). 

The identity of L.S. has yet to be conclusively verified, though evidence points to the person of interest known as [[[Black Queen Hub|the Black Queen]]] (see linked files).

For a long time, the Foundation had very little information about the Serpent&#39;s Hand. Existing information was received mostly through leaks from [[[goc-hub-page|Global Occult Coalition]]] intelligence, and was limited or incomplete in nature. GOC intelligence did not seem to reflect the current status of the group, despite clear inside information.

A breakthrough was made with the Foundation&#39;s discovery of the Wanderers&#39; Library, an anomalous extradimensional location accessed through portals (referred to as &#34;Ways&#34;) found in many different parts of the world. The Serpent&#39;s Hand seems primarily based from this location, though they have no direct control over it.

Direct assaults on the Library have so far proven unfeasible, even when entrance could be found. Foundation agents presently do not seem to be able to access the Library without making use of anomalous methods, and even then with near-zero success rate. Foundation agents are attacked on sight by anomalous entities upon successful entrance. 

This also seems to be the case for GOC agents (though some are merely escorted out, while others are killed immediately). The GOC seems to have some access to the Library through intermediaries, however. Foundation efforts to infiltrate the Wanderers&#39; Library are ongoing.

Mobile Task Force Tau-9 (&#34;Bookworms&#34;) has been assigned to specialize in the investigation, tracking, acquisition, and containment of individuals and artifacts related to the Serpent&#39;s Hand and the Wanderer&#39;s Library. Due to the general necessity of non-anomalous containment methods and other difficulties, progress has so far been slow, though many identified Hand individuals are presently under surveillance.

The Serpent&#39;s Hand seems to be extremely active in the general paranormal community. They have a high level of interest in the Global Occult Coalition (who they call &#34;The Bookburners&#34;) and the SCP Foundation itself (referred to as &#34;The Jailors&#34; or &#34;Jailers&#34;), regarding both with animosity.

The Hand&#39;s relationship with the GOC is particularly hostile; most recorded cases of unprovoked violence by Serpent&#39;s Hand members have been against GOC agents. The Serpent&#39;s Hand seem estranged from the GOC&#39;s 108 member organizations, despite similarities in focus on thaumotology and other occultic practices, and a number of shared methods. 

This situation seems to be due to the GOC policy of destroying most anomalous entities which are non-human in origin or which they cannot efficiently control.  Additionally, the GOC treats Hand members as enemy agents to be engaged or killed on sight. The Foundation seem to be the focus of less anger from the Serpent&#39;s Hand due to Foundation policy of containing and not destroying most anomalous entities; however, Hand animosity towards the Foundation is still high.

The Hand has unfriendly relations with the Chaos Insurgency (who they call &#34;The Madmen&#34;) and middling relations with the [[[ORIA Hub|Office for the Reclamation of Islamic Artifacts]]] (sometimes hostile, sometimes cooperative; see files on House Afseneh) and the Horizon Initiative. 

The Hand seems to have neutral-to-friendly relations with the Manna Charitable Foundation, and is tolerant of non-violent Fifthist Church and Church of the Broken God members.

A few members of the Hand seem to be also members of &#34;Are We Cool Yet?&#34; though they seem to be among the more pacifist members of that collective; a number of non-AWCY anomalous artists (&#34;anartists&#34;) have been identified in the Hand&#39;s ranks as well.

The Hand seems to have occasional interactions with agents of Marshall, Carter, and Dark (whom they call &#34;The Merchants&#34;) within the Wanderers&#39; Library, though these seem neutral rather than friendly. Outside the Library, Hand members have clashed with MC&amp;D agents on several known occasions.

Hand raids on Foundation facilities have been steadily increasing in number, as has their ability to evade capture and to successfully &#34;liberate&#34; SCP items. Formerly, the GOC seemed to be able to keep Hand numbers in check, but this no longer seems to be the case. 

Efforts to neutralize the Serpent&#39;s Hand in a more permanent fashion are ongoing.

Welcome.

To anyone willing or able to read this: This is for you.

We are the Serpent&#39;s Hand. 

We are a movement, unified by a common belief:

That humanity and all the other peoples of the known worlds do not deserve to be kept in darkness and ignorance.

The Serpent&#39;s Hand doesn&#39;t coordinate as a group. We are a loose collection of splinters. Our enemies tend to misunderstand this -- for instance, the Foundation&#39;s obsession with L.S., a person most of us have never met. Or the Serpent&#39;s Nest, with their shifting identities. Yes, they are all leaders, because they are people we respect, people we take advice from, and some of us will follow their plans. But they aren&#39;t all of us. 

There&#39;s no special way to join the Hand. There are no secret rituals done in basements or closets. We hold no elections for our leaders. If you want to become a member of the Serpent&#39;s Hand, all you have to do is decide you are a member of the Serpent&#39;s Hand.

Most of us are ordinary people, though our enemies do not understand this. We are ordinary people who embrace the anomalous, the supernatural, the ethereal. We oppose its suppression. How can we not? Our friends, family members, and sometimes we ourselves fall outside of the bounds of normalcy. Every single one of us has experienced the anomalous. We are the things in heaven and earth that were not dreamt of in your philosophy.

To the heralds of traditional power such as the SCP Foundation, the Global Occult Coalition, and most world governments, the anomalous is a slowly spreading poison, threatening to destroy everything civilization has worked so hard to create. 

But anomalous people are people, and the anomalous itself is not a threat merely for existing. Yes, it presents danger, but so do germs and meteors and forest fires. Suppressing knowledge of something will only make it more dangerous, and keep all of us huddling, frightened, in the dark.

When normalcy starts hurting the people who have to live under it, to try to cure a &#39;poison&#39;, //normalcy is itself the poison//. 

The SCP Foundation and the Global Occult Coalition are playing the role now that the Catholic Church played when they imprisoned Galileo for discovering that the world revolved around the sun. Their practices and beliefs are the death of knowledge, the death of science, the death of light. 

Take the Wanderers&#39; Library as an example, the place where the Serpent&#39;s Hand makes its home. The Library is the largest repository of knowledge the worlds have ever seen, the Holy Grail for those seeking to understand the preternatural. And yet, both the SCP Foundation and the Global Occult Coalition have been thrown out of this place that welcomes all. Why? Because they tried to destroy it, or take it for themselves so no one else could have it. Because of this, they are condemned to blunder in the dark.

Everyone reasonable agrees that people should defend themselves against supernatural threats. But how can you protect yourself if you burn and bury the books and imprison or execute the people who could tell you how? Would you try to protect yourselves against nuclear weapons by telling everyone to pretend they don&#39;t exist?

The Serpent&#39;s Hand were barred from the Library too, once. There was a reason we could not re-discover it until 1967. But no more. We&#39;ve learned from our mistakes.

To any members of the GOC and the Foundation who may read this: 

We are growing so large because of //you//. We were more like you, once, just one more inbred secret society hoarding occult knowledge to ourselves.

Then the Foundation began increasing its scale. There have always been Jailors, but not like this, not in millennia. Yet, still, they kept themselves in the dark, with only their leaders ever knowing the full extent of the world on Earth outside the everyday. So they were tolerable, for a time.

But then came the Seventh Occult War, the Foundation Civil War. The rise of the Global Occult Coalition -- the Bookburners, the Big Brother -- and the grand-scale campaign against the paranatural community that followed. The Coalition became the oppressive shelter to which the cowards of the paranatural community fled. A shame that there were only 108 slots, and only for human-dominated organizations. Or perhaps not a shame at all. Our old selves did not seek membership then, and we are fortunate for that.

So the Serpent&#39;s Hand rose up. Not out of desire, nor fear, but out of clear and pressing need. To keep all peoples from being chained forever in the dark.

We, the Serpent&#39;s Hand, ask both of you this:

How many KTEs does the Global Occult Coalition catalogue? It must seem like the supernatural is a vast hydra -- two new heads sprouting for each that is cut off. How long will you keep cutting?

How many SCP items does the Foundation contain now? Two thousand? Three thousand? Five? More? How long before there is no more room for prisons to be constructed? Will you put the whole world in a containment cell?

You admit it to yourselves, privately. The anomalous is on the rise. You cannot hold back the future forever.

You are the monsters you are so afraid of. Let go of your fear, and join us in the light.

And if you will not... if you keep imprisoning and killing innocents, if you keep forcing the world to stay in the dark... then you will meet the fate of all the slavers and murderers in the worlds&#39; history before you.

We will free those you keep imprisoned. We will rescue those you try to kill.

The Garden is the Serpent&#39;s place. 

We are the Serpent&#39;s Hand.
