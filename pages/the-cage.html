**Journal of Frank Adam Bourne**

**26/04/2013:**  

Today was a little strange. I had just closed up and was heading out the door when a short man in a suit approached me. He asked if I was interested in a business proposition. Now I&#39;ve had my fair share of run-ins with schemers and crooks, so I was a little wary of this guy.

He explained to me he is a liason of Harburgh Holdings Ltd., a rather large real estate holdings corp. He said he wanted to purchase my bar. That got my attention... I nearly flat out rejected him until he gave me the offer.

$867,000. All in cash, off the books. I did my research on the company and they had a website and everything... they&#39;re good for it. I even phoned their office and they confirmed they had sent a representative to meet with me. They seem legit.

I&#39;m going to take the night to think about it.

**27/04/2013:**

I sold the bar. I shook the man&#39;s hand and wished him good luck. He offered to keep me on full-time as the manager. I figured, hey, why not. I mean his company&#39;s already paid me enough for me to buy my own apartment building... I can&#39;t lose here. It&#39;ll give me something to do during the day too... I don&#39;t want to spend any more time with the wife than I have to.

They started bringing in their stuff today. By the end of the week we should be ready to re-open. He says he wants me to take a few days off in the meantime, while he gets the place set up.

**4/05/2013:**

Now we&#39;re back in business! Strange thing, a few days ago, the same guy from the company paid me a visit. He said he&#39;s renaming the bar to the &#39;Vic Stanley Country Club&#39;. I think I vomited internally, but I never told him I didn&#39;t care for the new name.

He&#39;s turning it into a geezer&#39;s hangout. Today they hung a massive sign up outside. Whoop-de-do.

**07/05/2013:**

I need to be more regular with these entries. Right now I&#39;m kind of feeling my way around these new owners, trying to get back on my legs and with the rythm [sic]. The last few days have been kind of hectic while we get used to the speed of things.

Today, we had this lady and her husband come in. They had a bite. The waitress said they talked her ear off about Jerry Lee Lewis. Bunch of weirdos.... he hasn&#39;t been relevant in 30 years. Whatever, I shouldn&#39;t concern myself with what others do. Doctor says it&#39;s bad for my health or something.

**09/05/2013:**

The last few days have seen an increase in Jerry Lee Lewis fans coming here. I have no idea why they decided to make this their hangout.

Funny, most of them have said that they attended a Jerry Lee concert at this exact venue a couple months ago. I told them that can&#39;t be right, I owned the place back then, and we never hosted any concerts.

**10/05/2013:**

I had a good long chat with some of the patrons that came in. We talked for hours about Jerry Lee Lewis... one of them lent me a CD of his.

I remember going to that show of his, a few months back, clear as day. Think about it.

**11/05/2013:**

The short man in the suit asked us to try out this new brew they concocted. Think about it. It was alright, tasted perhaps a little bitter.

I asked him if I could change the music in the P.A. to Jerry Lee. He said &#39;go nuts&#39;. 

**13/05/2013:**

I can feel it closing in on me like teeth... I hope it goes back to the cage.

**14/05/2013:**

I&#39;ve been listening to my recording of the concert for DAYS. It&#39;s so good.

I wish I could find that record &#39;Rock &amp; Roll Sacrificial&#39; somewhere... no store around here carries it. I want to hear it.

I want to learn it! I need to learn it. If I learn it, maybe it won&#39;t take me. Maybe I will get to meet him. Yeah. It can&#39;t come out again. It needs to stay in its cage. In the cage. In the cage. In the cage. In the cage. Stay in the cage. Yes.

Think about it.

**16/05/2013:**

Too tired. Can&#39;t think about it.

**17/05/2013:**

Fuck, I feel like I got ran over by a train. My head&#39;s been pounding non-stop for the last 3 days.

We still get those Jerry Lee Lewis superfans non-stop. Some of the regulars complain of headaches as well. 

Today they rolled out the new brew as a full replacement. It&#39;s actually worse than the old stuff... I have no clue why they insist on it.

**21/05/2013:**

I quit. I&#39;m sick and tired of &#39;Jerry Lee Lewis&#39; this, and &#39;Jerry Lee&#39; that... those nutjobs can keep the place. It&#39;s turned into a disaster since they bought it.

&gt; **&lt;BEGIN REPORT&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **April 26th, 2013.** I approached Mr. Bourne with the offer to purchase his estabilishment on behalf of Harburgh Holdings Ltd. Phase One of Operation &#39;Pee Wee&#39;s Place&#39; has begun.
&gt; 
&gt; **April 27th, 2013.** Mr. Bourne accepted my offer. Ownership of the property was subsequently transferred to Harburgh Holdings Ltd., a subsidiary of Foundation Public Holdings.
&gt; 
&gt; **May 4th, 2013.** Renovations to the building were completed. The estabilished was officially renamed to the Vic Stanley Country Club. Phase One of Operation &#39;Pee Wee&#39;s Place&#39; complete.
&gt; 
&gt; **May 7th, 2013.** As anticipated, a large number of subjects afflicted with SCP-2971 have begun gathering on the property.
&gt; 
&gt; **May 10th, 2013.** Mr. Bourne infected with SCP-2971.
&gt; 
&gt; **May 13th, 2013.** Mr. Bourne requested to change the estabilishment&#39;s P.A. music player to all Jerry Lee Lewis songs. Request granted, as I deemed this beneficial to the mission. Phase Two of Operation &#39;Pee Wee&#39;s Place&#39; underway.
&gt; 
&gt; **May 16th, 2013.** Subjects who consumed the amnestic-laced alcoholic beverages show symptoms of headaches. Product is believed to be working as intended.
&gt; 
&gt; **May 18th, 2013.** All subjects previously infected by SCP-2971 have shown complete recovery. Phase Two of Operation &#39;Pee Wee&#39;s Place&#39; ongoing, but first trial run is a success.
&gt; 
&gt; **May 19th, 2013.** Mr. Bourne&#39;s dwelling searched, several SCP-2971 items recovered, including near-complete audio recording of SCP-2971-A. 
&gt; 
&gt; **May 21st, 2013.** Mr. Bourne informed me he is terminating his employment two weeks from today&#39;s date. Search for replacement begun.
