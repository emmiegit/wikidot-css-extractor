*Item #:* SCP-7318

*Object Class:* Dark Keter

*Special Containment Procedures:* The SCP is to be kept in 5000m deep Antarctic ocean. For the containment procedures; two D-classes are to be sent in the cell to check that that SCP-7318-A and SCP- 7318-B are kept at their assigned position and do not contact. The D-classes are to clean the room and serve SCP-7318-B the desired food.

*Description:* The real SCP-7318 is a case scenario in which by the contact of either any human or SCP-7318-B with SCP-7318-A will cause a XK-Class end of the world scenario. SCP-7318-A is a hand made from concrete, rubble, dirt and clay with graffiti marks. It is in such a shape that it look like a hand shake. By looks It does not look anomalous but in a 22.31 meter radius, It compels any human to touch it with will give the human eternal youth and wisdom and the human will have control over all SCPs and other super natural power but with that if the human is not worthy, he will die in an instant and cause a XK-CLASS end of the world scenario. The SCP-7318-B is a human that the box was found with. The human is a handsome man with a British accent. He appears to have no sign of illnesses of ageing. He, at all times wears a three piece suit. Even though he appears very fit but still he has a very large appetite. The human is worthy of contact with SCP-7318-A but controls the urge to do so as he claims that he is from an other timeline where thing ended badly after some humans tried to gain control over SCP-7318-A. 
*Addendum:* This is an explanation from SCP-7318-B about his universe: 
SCP-7318-A:I am from a universe where I was the O5-A3 and had control over everything until it appeared..
Interviewer:*what appeared?
SCP-7318-A:That fu*king hand. He came as nothing but he destroyed our whole world
Interviewer:*how? 
SCP-7318-A:*It felt like usual entry but when consecutively asked for permission to examine. We allowed for the testing. 
       *INTERVIEW ABRUPTLY CUT*
