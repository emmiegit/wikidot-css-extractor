Hello I am DL_Baryonyx, local frenchman roaming the lands of author blocks and procrastination.
I wrote my first SCP in 2018 after motivation finally pushed me to contribute on the community i have been following for a few years now. I am the leader of the SCP minecraft mod, [https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/scp-lockdown SCP Lockdown] as well as a former developper on [https://www.scp-unity.com/ SCP Unity].
Below are all my contributions. [http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/dl-baryonyx Sandbox]

**__Main Site articles__:**

[[[SCP-4169]]] - Carbonized Purgatory: This was my first article on the site. The history behind that SCP was me wanting to pay tribute to a scene that genuinely scared me as a kid, the famous bug pit scene of King Kong (2005). I&#39;m surprised it&#39;s still on the site, as I wouldn&#39;t call it anything special. But I&#39;m nonetheless proud of how it ended up, considering it was my very first article.

[[[SCP-4178]]] - Arachnespheksophobia: I consider 4178 to be my first true article (and most successful). Originally an entry for the clich√© contest in 2019 running in the spooky monster category. It was deleted after falling below -10. After picking it back up and enhancing it and commisionning an image to a friend, it was reposted and currently sits at +40.

[[[SCP-4191]]] - Draco ignem: 4191 is a special case, originally it was the idea of a friend that worked a bit on it. After a year of inactivity he passed the torch onto me and i completed it using his feedback. 4191 is quite barebone but i took the opportunity of trying to make it interesting by doing something unusual, linking it with a foreign SCP! [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-124-fr SCP-124-FR] to be precise.

[[[SCP-4307]]] - Electro-Marine Praetorian: Ahh 4307, written under 3 weeks not counting the wait for approval and feedback. 4307 was actually the very first SCP i came up with but was my third article on the site. 

[[[SCP-6188]]] - Joining the Ranks: This concept actually came to me after encountering a glitch on Men of War: Assault Squad 2 while playing with a friend, one of my tanks got knocked out and everytime soldiers tried to enter it to man it, they would be erased from the ongoing battle. Despite the similarities, I didn&#39;t draw any inspiration from [[[SCP-3008]]]

[[[SCP-6813]]] - An Ignited Melody: This SCP has been in the work for over a year and went through around 6-7 versions. The initial concept was inspired by the film White Tiger and originally was just about a tank that would materialise around the world to attack vehicles before being seemingly destroyed. I am glad that I managed to completly rework the concept and turn into what it is today.
