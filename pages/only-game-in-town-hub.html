&gt; &#34;//I against my brother, my brothers and I against my cousins, then my cousins and I against strangers.//&#34;

&gt; &#34;//It was the first Word. There had been many words before, too many to count, in fact. But they had simply floated along without solid ground. But with the Word, there was a patch of earth upon which to build. And from that one patch of earth grew a mighty forest.//&#34;

&gt; //&#34;As the gates finally began to buckle, the last call to prayer was made. For a single perfect moment, the hammering of the siege engines was drowned out by the cries from a thousand minarets. In every mosque and every church, the imams and priests spoke of worlds left behind and worlds to come. Baghdad, the city of light, jewel of the world, holder of man&#39;s knowledge, was at an end.//
&gt; 
&gt; //The next day, the Tigris ran black and red.&#34;//

&gt; //&#34;These scenes included graphic and disturbing imagery, inappropriate language, and nihilistic ideas harmful to the development of a healthy adolescent mind. Whether or not these insertions were deliberate or in error is immaterial; many of of these young ladies have suffered significant and ongoing psychological distress. We are seeking redress not for purposes of  material gain, but in the interest of justice for these poor girls.&#34;//

[[collapsible show=&#34;That&#39;s cute. But seriously, what&#39;s all this about?&#34; hide=&#34;A few words&#34;]]

**&#34;Rudie&#34;** - The entity that is the focus of this canon (we call it &#34;Rudie&#34;) is far older than mankind. It is the concept of fear of the unknown, of the &#34;other.&#34; Once among the most powerful thoughts, its influence has begun to wane somewhat with the advancement of science and mutual understanding. For the most part, it has no way of physically interacting with the &#34;real&#34; world; it can only attempt to shape the thoughts of man. 

Rudie sees its greatest enemy as the written word. Whereas oral tradition can change, creating uncertainty, the written word is permanent and affixes the story to certain word choices.

It is in every story of the unknown, whether of triumph over the foreign army with strange customs or of defeat against the unknowable gods, from multi-volume epics to fevered nightmares. Within these stories, it can generally only act out the role assigned to it - as Grendel, it will //always// attack the hall of Hereot, as the dragon, it will always be slain by St. George.  However, there are some instances where it has been able to break free of its role and move through the tale as it pleases. Relatively recently, it has managed to change the stories that it is in. Some speculate that this may have to do with its time spent in...

**The Library** - A meeting place of many worlds, the Library holds every written document ever written, and many that have never been written. The Library began its existence when the first word was written, although it did not attain its present form until the events of Tale of the Library. Because of its unique creation as both something physical and narrative, it is a place where both physical and metaphysical entities can interact. It&#39;s not uncommon to see non-Euclidan geometries or former gods wandering the passages of the Library.

Through committing thoughts and deeds to the page, the Library gives order to the world. Stories become immutable and fixed rather than changeable. Knowledge can be built upon rather than simply preserved.

//Please note:// There are many, //many// theories about the Library&#39;s origins and nature. The tales in this canon are just a few of them. In other words, don&#39;t take this as the Ultimate Final Word on the Library.
