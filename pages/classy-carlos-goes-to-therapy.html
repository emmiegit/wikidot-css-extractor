A lone sticky note rested on the door to a bathroom stall, its yellow surface covering a phone number advertised as being able to provide its caller with &#39;a good time.&#39; On that sticky note was a crudely drawn, rotund, horned creature with even less detailed arms and legs with its name proudly emblazoned beside it; &#39;Durbal.&#39; The odd creature spoke ceaselessly of the many faults of the door, seemingly to no one but itself.

&#34;The bathroom stall door does not give the toilet user proper privacy as it does not cover their feet.&#34;

&#34;The bathroom stall door is highly unhygienic and carries many infections.&#34;

&#34;The bathroom stall door is missing a bolt in the top hinge and is prone to structural failure.&#34;

&#34;The janitor responsible for maintaining the bathroom stall door should be fired.&#34;

On and on it droned until he was eventually joined by a second voice.

&#34;Hello, my esteemed gentleman. I trust you are in good health?&#34;

A bodyless head manifested beside the sticky note, possessing a large smile, fantastic mane, and dapper bowtie with the phrase &#39;Keep it classy&#39; and the word &#39;enjoy&#39; appearing to its right. The newcomer looked over to his companion and smiled pleasantly. Durbal stopped for a moment as if to contemplate.

&#34;Classy Carlos looks like a whale&#34;

&#34;Classy Carlos&#39; hair looks like a toupee.&#34;

&#34;Classy Carlos does not appear human.&#34;

&#34;Classy Carlos&#39; handwriting is sloppy.&#34;

The newcomer appeared to gasp as if slightly offended. He shook his head and clicked his tongue in obvious disapproval.

&#34;Goodness, this is no way to start a conversation. You are quite the rude indi-&#34;

He was interrupted by the sticky note, who seemingly did not care to entertain a conversation.

&#34;Classy Carlos is not licensed by the APA or any other similar psychological association.&#34;

&#34;Classy Carlos is not properly qualified to provide others with psychological assistance.&#34;

&#34;Classy Carlos does not ask if people are looking for help and forces it onto others.&#34;

&#34;Classy Carlos appears to people in vulnerable states so they cannot refute his unreliable advice.&#34;

Once again the floating head looked at its partner in dismay.

&#34;Sir, if anyone is forcing anything onto anyone, it is you! How do you expect us to talk if you keep cutting me o-&#34;

Again, he was cut off by Durbal who did not show signs of stopping. 

&#34;Classy Carlos appears in public restrooms without prior notice or invitation.&#34;

&#34;Classy Carlos is probably a voyeur.&#34;

&#34;Classy Carlos should be arrested and serve a sentence for sexual harassment.&#34;

&#34;Classy Carlos does not like being spoken over.&#34;

&#34;Classy Carlos does not like having his unrequited advice refuted.&#34;

&#34;Classy Carlos does no-&#34;

Suddenly, Durbal stopped. Classy Carlos disappeared, looking quite upset as he did. There was a brief silence in the bathroom as the sticky note appeared to contemplate once more. But the silence would not last. There was more critique to be given.

&#34;The bathroom stall door is squeaky because it has not been greased in five years.&#34;
