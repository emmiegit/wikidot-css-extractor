**SnapCracklePop Item #:** SCP-3000-J™

**Cereal Class:** G-r-r-reat!

**Special Calcium Procedures:** SCP-3000-J™ was previously locked away in the top secret Cereal Containment Facility, because it was deemed too dangerously delicious for the normal public! Now, super secret cereal squad Mobile Taskforce YUM-1™ (“Captains Crunch”) has snuck in, and broke it out so you could taste it now![[footnote]]A containment breach for brunch! Crunch![[/footnote]]  Now, it is to be contained as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol. This diet is also to include foods high in fiber and vitamins, like SCP-3000-J™! It&#39;s part of a complete breakfast!

SCP-3000-J™ was invented by a crazy mad scientist, who combined the tastes of tangy peanut butter, smooth chocolate, sweet frosted flakes, and crispy rice puffs into a concoction so good it warped reality. Kellogg&#39;s® sent their special Mobile Taskforce YUM-1™ in to recover the new cereal. They put it deep in secret containment alongside all the monsters they had caught, like Ignatz the Immortal Lizard™, his Japanese friend Shy Sammy the Statue™, and their arch-nemesis Grand Karcist Ion™ of Calcium, leader of the evil Sark-Bites™ and high priest of the Fifth Church of the Broken Spoon. One day, Grand Karcist Ion had broken free and decided to send his Sark-Bite army to encourage unhealthy eating habits in kids all over the world. Emboldened by the delicious and nutritious taste of Foundation Flakes™,  The Kellogg&#39;s® O5 Council™ allowed Ignatz™ and Shy Sammy™ to join forces with Mobile Taskforce YUM-1™ and Kellogg&#39;s® to defeat the Sark-Bite™ army using the power of a healthy breakfast!

**Addendum-1:** The following interview took place during a showdown between Mobile Taskforce YUM-1™ and Grand Karcist Ion™

&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log █/██/█&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Grand Karcist Ion™:** You can&#39;t stop me! My Sark-Bite™ army is too powerful! Together, They will help me rule the world!!! Ha Ha Ha !
&gt; 
&gt; **Ignatz™:** Here Ion, try a delicious bowl of Foundation Flakes™. They&#39;re delicious AND nutritious!
&gt; 
&gt; **Grand Karcist Ion™:** (//Chews a spoonful slowly.//) Oh drat, this is really good! I guess I really had followed the way of all flesh against this scrumptious cereal. Me and my Sark-Bites will go home, but you haven&#39;t seen the last of us!
&gt; 
&gt; **Ignatz™:** Silly Ion, nobody can resist the taste of Foundation Flakes™!
&gt; 

**Addendum-2:** Hey kids, help Ignatz the Immortal Lizard™ find his way through the maze to the party at Alagadda City where he can eat all the Foundation Flakes™ he wants! Better be quick, because mean old Grand Karcist Ion™ will find him and steal his cereal!
