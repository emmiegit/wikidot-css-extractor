**Special Containment Procedures:** 6 FHT Class Security Frigates, along with Aquatic Research Vessel //Herron// will maintain a seven-point blockade around Moaha Island.[[footnote]] 1°52&#39;40.3&#34;S by 134°48&#39;13.1&#34;W, South Pacific Ocean [[/footnote]] At the beginning of each lunar month [[footnote]] Every 29.5 days. [[/footnote]], a varied assortment of food must be deposited into this island&#39;s volcanic crater, including:

* 40-50kg vegetables (e.g., cassava, taro, sweet potato, purple yam).
* 30-40kg fruits (e.g., mango, pineapple, cherimoya, jackfruit).
* 50-80kg fish (e.g., tuna, salmon, marlin, dorado).
* 40-80kg assorted nuts, herbs, and seaweed.
* 60-80kg pork, shredded/smoked.

These provisions, based on the staple foods of a Pacific/Oceanian native society, have a 78-83% chance of being accepted by SCP-4338. Should a deposit be rejected, the appointed &#34;leader&#34; should proceed to an isolated location to avoid destruction of Foundation property and additional loss of life. For more details, see &#34;4338-DN Event Overview&#34; below.

**Description:** SCP-4338 is a sapient, levitating, 2.3km^^3^^ sphere of volcanic rock inhabiting the magma chamber beneath Moaha Island. Multiple artifacts and oral traditions reference this entity as &#34;Ōsobiue&#34;, &#34;Irn&#39;acha&#34;, or &#34;God of the Burning Ocean&#34;: a central figure in the creation myths -- and extinction events -- of some 19 early oceanic cultures.

[[collapsible show=&#34;4338-DN Event Overview&#34; hide=&#34;4338-DN Event Overview&#34;]] 

A 4338-DN Event, also known as a &#34;rejected offering&#34; event, will be signaled by a large-scale eruption of Moaha Volcano. Soon after, SCP-4338 will emerge from the magma conduit, travelling towards the leader of the closest human social group. SCP-4338 is acutely aware of group hierarchy; use of D-class personnel as decoy leaders has proven ineffective. While in transit, SCP-4338&#39;s exterior shell will fracture and dislodge large tendrils of molten rock and metal ore. These appendages are used mainly for demolishing obstacles encountered in SCP-4338&#39;s pursuit, which will not stop until either:

**(A)** 3-5 live, healthy persons are dropped into the volcanic crater [[footnote]] Use of this technique is forbidden by order of the Ethics Committee. [[/footnote]] or 
**(B)** the &#34;leader&#34; is dead. 

Cause of death is inconsequential, but typically occurs when SCP-4338 ensnares its pursuant in one of its tendrils. SCP-4338 will then absorb this individual&#39;s corpse into its core body, and withdraw. Within 20 minutes, a mote of lava will fall from SCP-4338 containing a duplicate of the deceased. While visually identical, this duplicate will be fully inorganic, and contain a core of animated, super-heated minerals. Once this process is complete, any previous proxy will collapse into shards of volcanic glass. These entities act as a consciousness vessel and communication vehicle for SCP-4338, who will only converse with the next &#34;leader&#34; once they have formally declared themselves.[[footnote]] Revision required, See 4338-DN-41.

For the first time in its 73 years of containment, SCP-4338 emerged halfway through the lunar month. Current &#34;leader&#34;, Director Morgan Rowell, was already on the island collecting soil samples at the time. Including Director Rowell, 3 Foundation personnel were lost during this event. 

A proxy emerged only 14 minutes later. In another unprecedented act, Rowell / SCP-4338 were the ones to open communications, demanding to speak to a new &#34;leader&#34; without delay. Given the need for expediency, Head Researcher Amelia Thornborrow volunteered.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Interview Log 09/03/2018 | Morgan Rowell / SCP-4338  &#34; hide=&#34;Interview Log - Morgan Rowell / SCP-4338&#34;]] 

&gt; **Interviewed:** Morgan Rowell / SCP-4338.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** (Acting) Director Amelia Thornborrow.
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Rowell / SCP-4338 immediately began presenting the trademark &#34;cracking&#34; appearance past proxies have only shown after 4-8 months. Small fissures on the epidermis around the eyes, lips, and fingernails reveal an undercurrent of molten elements, steadily hardening into &#34;magma domes&#34;. As per protocol, Ms. Rowell was restrained with 8cm thick tungsten cuffs around the wrist and ankles.
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** Tell me why you attacked us.
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** SUCH IMPUDENCE. WILL YOU NOT GROVEL, OR BEG MY MERCY? WHAT COMPELS YOU TO ANGER YOUR OWN GOD? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** You&#39;re wearing my dead friend&#39;s face. I don&#39;t appreciate it. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** LEARN TO APPRECIATE, CHILD, OR PERHAPS I WILL TRAVEL TO THE GREAT SHORE, BRINGING FIRE AND ROCK TO YOUR S C P. HOW MANY LIVES ARE WORTH YOUR PRIDE, AM EEL YA?
&gt; 
&gt; //Director Thornborrow remains silent for several seconds, clenching and relaxing her hands.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** Why did you attack us? We have done exactly as you --
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** YOU INSULT ME. MOR GAN INSULTED ME. I ASK FOR THE PEAK OF THE HARVEST, AND NOW I LEARN YOU GIVE ME ITS MEALY ENDS!
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** I don&#39;t understand. All the food we&#39;ve provided has been of the highest quality --
&gt; 
&gt; //Rowell/4338 suddenly bites down through their lower lip, spitting the escaping molten liquid across the interview table. Smearing this substance with their fingertip, they melt a single word into the metal surface, all in stylized, looping cursive.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** I WANT THIS.
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** C-... what is that... C-ad ... Cadbury? Who --
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** I ONLY SPEAK YOUR WORDS; I DO NOT BOTHER WITH YOUR SYMBOLS. IF THIS MEANS &#34;CADBURY&#34;, THEN YES, I WANT CADBURY. I WANT THE SWEET, MELTING RESIN.
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** Wait, hang on... were these symbols on a kind of reflective sheet? Was that wrapped around this &#34;Cadbury&#34; in small, brown squares?
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** YES. ONE OF YOUR FOLLOWERS OFFERED IT UNTO ME. A PITIFUL SUM, BUT PLENTIFUL IN FLAVOR. BRING ME MORE OF THIS &#34;CADBURY&#34;, OR BRING ME THE ONE WHO CAN!

[[collapsible show=&#34;Interview Log 09/03/2018 | Kevin Emerson&#34; hide=&#34;Interview Log - Kevin Emerson&#34;]] 

&gt; **Interviewed:** Kevin Emerson, Junior Researcher within the Geology Department, currently assigned to SCP-4338.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Agent Rhodes.
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Rhodes clicks &#34;pause&#34; on his laptop, halting a recording of the previous interview.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Rhodes:** You threw chocolate into the volcano.
&gt; 
&gt; **Emerson:** ... You can&#39;t prove that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Rhodes:** We did a full sweep of every ship, Mr. Emerson. We know you have a whole suitcase full of-
&gt; 
&gt; **Emerson:** Oh, so, immediately this is all my fault because I like junk food? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Rhodes:** We&#39;re not blaming you for your eating habits, Kevin; we&#39;re blaming you for waking up a Volcano God! Now, do we have to launch a whole formal inquiry here, or-
&gt; 
&gt; **Emerson:** Jesus, fine! I did it! I wasn&#39;t trying to breach containment or anything; I was just bored, okay!? All I&#39;ve done since I got here is sift silt!
&gt; 
&gt; **Rhodes:** ...You&#39;re a //geologist.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Emerson:** An //anomaly// geologist. The geology here is //non-anomalous//. We&#39;ve known since the friggin&#39; 50&#39;s that the only abnormal thing on this island is the stupid orb; but no, command keeps putting in work orders with our department, and this month I drew the short straw. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Rhodes:** That still doesn&#39;t explain why-
&gt; 
&gt; **Emerson:** No -- just -- I&#39;m getting to that, okay? So, I was out having my lunch and -- I mean, before now, we were totally convinced that only the crater connected to 4338, not every little lava-flow! So, I wasn&#39;t technically breaking protocol by, y&#39;know, &#34;disposing&#34; of my leftovers.
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Rhodes rubs the bridge of his nose, head downcast.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Rhodes:** Protocol doesn&#39;t just mean-- ... wait, &#34;leftovers&#34;? What do you mean, &#34;leftovers&#34;? It wasn&#39;t just the chocolate?
&gt; 
&gt; **Emerson:** Well yeah, no, I mean, there was some... other... stuff...
&gt; 
&gt; //Mr. Emerson folds his hands in his lap, purses his lips, and looks away from Agent Rhodes.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Rhodes:** What other stuff?
&gt; 
&gt; //Mr. Emerson does not respond.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Rhodes:** Kevin, what else did you throw into the lava?
