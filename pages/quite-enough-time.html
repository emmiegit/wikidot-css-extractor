+ **##teal|&#34;Quite Enough Time&#34;##**  
+++ by Deepend Teal feat. Cuig!

Ayo!

It&#39;s ya boy, Cuig!

Hit it!

~

I thought I saw you walking &#39;cross the street this one time the other day
Panicked for a moment, forgot what I wanted to saaaaaay.
I miss the days we had when it was just me you and the stars
All those feelings under a moonlit sky that made feel like I could fly away!

~

Cause I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve made quite enough time, quite enough time
To think about me and you, and now it&#39;s all on the line, all on the line.
Been here before, know the plan like I&#39;m about to do some crime
Like the back of my hand, fingers spread, I know I&#39;ma be fine, I&#39;ma be fine.

~

I remember that one we hung back after school, after school
You were having a rough time, we went to the pool, went to the pool.
And as we lay out there, drifting across that starry sea
I told you that, forever, you&#39;d be cool to me, cool to me.

~

But even now I can feel us driftin&#39; apart
I know I don&#39;t still have that special part within your heart, in your heart.
Cause we could be the best thing ever seen by mankind, mankind
Just stick right here with me, and soon enough I&#39;ll blow your mind.

~

Cause I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve made quite enough time, quite enough time
To think about me and you, and now it&#39;s all on the line, all on the line.
Been here before, know the plan like I&#39;m about to do some crime
Like the back of my hand, fingers spread, I know I&#39;ma be fine, I&#39;ma be fine.
//(It&#39;s Cuig, yo!)//

~

Yeah baby, I can blow your mind
Right up like a starburst, five-point, make ya go blind.
So cut me off like a finger, if ya feel it&#39;s right //(Yeah, right)//
Or stick with me and stars, I can do it all night. //(All night)//
Cause, for real, you make me feel like I&#39;m ethereal.
Like a ghost, floating around like I&#39;m in space //(Up in space)//
Come right over here, lemme kiss yo face. //(Yo pretty face)//
Baby, stick with me, now come and see //(Come and see)//
Cause we can bring this world with us for eternity. //(Hell yeah!)//

~

Cause I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve made quite enough time, quite enough time
To think about me and you, and now it&#39;s all on the line, all on the line.
Been here before, know the plan like I&#39;m about to do some crime
Like the back of my hand, fingers spread, I know I&#39;ma be fine, I&#39;ma be fine.
