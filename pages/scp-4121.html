**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4121 cannot be contained without causing a CK-class restructuring scenario or a ZK-class reality failure scenario. Public philosophical documentation or &#34;theories&#34; relating to SCP-4121 are to be --suppressed-- monitored. Scientific confirmation of SCP-4121 is to be discredited or suppressed. Individuals responsible for public research into SCP-4121 are to be placed into Foundation employ or (if uncooperative) terminated. All research into SCP-4121 is to be confined to Site-Ω1. 

Counteractive efforts targeting SCP-4121 should remain in a partially constructed conceptual stage. Should SCP-4121 experience widespread neutralisation, all emergency protocols for affected items should be initiated simultaneously. Emergency Order Motus-Omega must be fully conceived and initiated. Initiation of Emergency Order Motus-Omega is to be considered an Alpha-1 Priority task. 

All staff assigned to Site-Ω1 must remain in Site-Ω1. MTF Psi-58 (Immovable Objects) are to halt any personnel attempting to exit Site-Ω1. No attempts at euthanisation are to be made. All research divisions of Site-Ω1 are not to collaborate, exchange research or change divisions without authorisation by Site Director Edwin.   

**Description:** SCP-4121 is a spacetime impetus paradox affecting the current reality inhabited by the human race, the SCP Foundation and all associated items of importance. Currently SCP-4121 does not affect the entirety of surface reality, instead it is localised to specific physical and conceptual items. These include organisations, persons/entities of interest, areas and events. Possible changes in the behaviour of SCP-4121, including the possibility of universal coverage, are covered in Emergency Order Motus-Omega. 

SCP-4121 causes a &#34;causal stasis&#34; effect, in which certain events cannot proceed beyond a point in time. Similarly actions affecting certain entities cannot proceed. This effect has been both beneficial and harmful to the SCP Foundation. While SCP-4121 served to effectively maintain the current status quo, it has also prevented the direct improvement or enhancement of containment practices for a number of SCPs. SCP-4121 has also hindered relations with multiple GoIs, however it is likely the anomaly has also had similar effects on the GoIs themselves. As a result, multiple offensive measures have remained at partial construction.  

Currently active countermeasures are impossible to develop, due to SCP-4121 affecting these ideas upon complete conceptualisation. Emergency Order Motus-Omega is under partial conceptual construction, as to avoid being affected by the anomaly. SCP-4121 does not affect items experiencing a fragmented conceptualisation. For example, if a concept is partially realised by three different persons, SCP-4121 will not hinder any developments. However if these &#34;proto-ideas&#34; a compiled to form a single concept, SCP-4121 will hinder actualisation. These items can also be documented, but all documentation must remain partially complete. Due to this, Emergency Order Motus-Omega is currently held in a fragmented form by all O5 Council members. 

SCP-4121 is hypothesised to also be effecting termination attempts of multiple SCPs (see Addendum 01/4121-ASCP). While this hypothesis cannot be confirmed in a traditional sense, containment procedures of SCPs not currently facing termination have been adapted to account for their &#34;causal invulnerability&#34;. Partially conceptualised termination plans have also been established.  

**Discovery:** 
SCP-4121 was first discovered by Dr. ██████ Edwin, who was previously assigned to [[[SCP-3229]]]. While investigating a means of proactive containment, Dr. Edwin stumbled upon a &#34;symptom&#34; of SCP-4121. The following are extracts from Dr. Edwin&#39;s personal log, referring to his investigation into this anomaly. 

&gt; **23/06/████.**
&gt; //I found multiple initiatives, declassified and approved, were never acted upon. I sent this information to Director Yu, thinking it was a localised anomaly. Perhaps the cave didn&#39;t want us going to certain places. Then while venting about the conundrum with one of my colleagues, Dr. Wallis, he told me he&#39;d noted behaviours among the hostile entities within 3229 that he suspected were linked.//

&gt; **25/06/████.**
&gt; //I have contacted researchers at other sites, searching for more evidence to confirm my theory. I&#39;ve come across a number of incidents that I think may lead my hypothesis to a much more dangerous conclusion. My initial suspicion, that something was affecting progress at Area 55, has been expanded. I contacted an old friend down in █████, he has higher clearance than I do. He told me there were several incidents similar to mine. Some chalked up as bureaucracy losing track, some were just marked under one SCP or another, some were just left to collect dust. All of which are sloppy, an uncharacteristic action for the Foundation. This warrants further investigation.//  
 
&gt; **26/06/████**
&gt; //Wallis brought me out of my feverish researching, but all I could talk about on break was how close I was to cracking it. It&#39;s all I can think of now. Wallis warned me the Director would be irate if this took precedence over my work on site. I&#39;ve chosen to ignore the warning. I don&#39;t bare any disrespect for the Director, nor do I doubt how important my usual work is. I just know I&#39;ve found something, something I can&#39;t leave to collect dust.// 

&gt; **29/06/████.**
&gt; //More findings on my personal project. We had a site breach today. I used it to look into some more... restricted data. I was lucky, very lucky, not to be shot. It was worth it though, this is an anomaly all to itself. Records of it are everywhere, they just didn&#39;t see all the puzzle pieces. I&#39;ve been trying to piece them all together as the Site calms down. Something has to be there, it has to.// 

&gt; **30/06/████.**
&gt; //Site Director Yu requested me in his office, I&#39;ve been told to expect all information to be classified at the highest level.// 

&gt; **01/07/████.**
&gt; //I was right.//

The following is an extract from Log 4121/ASCP, a collection of all SCP subjects hypothesised to be affected by SCP-4121&#39;s anomalous properties. Note that in some cases SCP-4121 also assists in the maintenance of current containment. For a comprehensive log of persons/GOIs affected by SCP-4121, see Log 4121/AG/P. For recorded events affected by SCP-4121, see Log 4121/AE.

**Addendum 02/4121**:
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Researcher Impairment&#34; hide=&#34;- ACCESSING FILE.&#34;]]
The following is a collection noting the psychological status of Site-Ω1 and various incidents that have hindered research as of ██/██/20██. For the full record of personnel and their full psych evaluations, see Document 4121-SSE. Currently 97% of staff have noted mental, physical, or causal strain to their work. 

&gt; **Dr. Emily Horan:**
&gt; **DOI [[footnote]]Date of Incident[[/footnote]]:** 08/04/████
&gt; **NOI [[footnote]]Nature of Incident[[/footnote]]:** Dr Horan began to suffer minor anxiety throughout the day, as well as reporting a &#34;foggy memory&#34; of the last three months of her assignment in Site-Ω1. 
&gt; **Current Status:** Dr Horan was permitted medical leave for 4 days, and was reporting much better mental health upon removal from Site-Ω1. However on return all knowledge of her previous research was removed from Dr Horan&#39;s memory. In addition Dr Horan was unable to conceive of new research related to SCP-4121.  
 
&gt; **Dr. Mark Mirandi:** 
&gt; **DOI:** 17/04/████
&gt; **NOI:** Dr Mirandi reported missing research files on SCP-4121, which he then set out to restore. Dr Mirandi has noted a sense of déjà vu upon reporting this incident. 
&gt; **Current Status:** Dr Mirandi continues to restore his files. Any attempt to remove Dr Mirandi from his causal loop has met with failure.

&gt; **Researcher David Brown:**
&gt; **DOI:** 02/05/████
&gt; **NOI:** Researcher Brown has suffered 15 panic attacks over the previous 8 days and has been diagnosed with clinical depression, despite having no record of mental illness in multiple prior staff screenings. Researcher Brown has repeatedly expressed that his research cannot be finished. 
&gt; **Current Status:** Attempts to reassign Researcher Brown have met with failure. Repeated attempts to assign medical aid to Researcher Brown have also met with failure. Attempts to self-terminate by Researcher Brown have met with failure. Researcher Brown currently remains on-site under supervision.

&gt; **Senior Researcher Anaya ████:** 
&gt; **DOI:** 11/05/████
&gt; **NOI:** Senior Researcher Anaya was detained as of 11/05 when she underwent a violent seizure and began to assault fellow staff members and subordinates. Witnesses describe Anaya as &#34;babbling&#34; and note a repeated mention of &#34;the loop&#34; that never breaks/never will be broken/never has been broken. 
&gt; **Current Status:** Senior Researcher Anaya remains detained in the medical wing and has remained unresponsive. She currently continues to vocalise that &#34;the loop never breaks, never will be, never has been broken.&#34;

&gt;** Sergeant Michael Sullivan:**
&gt; **DOI:** 27/07/████
&gt; **NOI:** Sergeant Michael Sullivan was responsible for an attempt to euthanise staff members of Site-Ω1. He was successful in eliminating one Researcher Bell, as evident by security footage.  
&gt; **Current Status:** Attempts to discipline Sergeant Sullivan have been unsuccessful. Researcher Bell has currently been euthanised five times. Both Sergeant Sullivan and Researcher Bell have been quarantined.

**Addendum 03/4121**:
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Ethics Review&#34; hide=&#34;- ACCESSING FILE.&#34;]]
The following is an extract from a report compiled by ████ Vann of the Ethics Committee, following an inspection of Site-Ω1. 

[[div style=&#34;background: gray; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;&#34;]]

[[div style=&#34;background: white; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;&#34;]]

██████. 

I have remained in your design for well beyond the time you assigned me, I remain to my course. This is an abomination. 

Site-Ω1 has the highest rate of staff incident in our entire organisation. In the entire //Foundation//. Edwin has men and women here rolling a boulder up a hill to just to see it roll down, and you just pile more dirt onto the hill. I&#39;ve been to Site-[REDACTED], I saw a man feed a child to 682; and I&#39;m more disgusted by this than anything I&#39;ve seen before. 

If these experiments had delivered any benefit at all then maybe, just maybe, I would be inclined to understand. I&#39;ve seen no progress and as such my recommendation is simple, tear it all down. We&#39;re financing and enabling torture. There is no excuse. 

Respectfully
████ Vann
Ethics Committee.

**Addendum 04/4121:** 
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ O5 Appeal&#34; hide=&#34;- CREDENTIALS RECOGNISED.&#34;]]
The following is an extract from Director Edwin&#39;s review by and appeal to the O5 Council. 

 
&gt; **Interviewed:** Site Director ██████ Edwin. 
&gt;   
&gt;  **Interviewer:** O5 Council
&gt;   
&gt;  **Foreword:** This interview was recorded directly following the review of ████ Vann, and prior to Director Edwin being directly affected by SCP-4121. 
&gt;   
&gt;  **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt;
&gt;  **O5-3:** Dr Edwin, you stand accused of a gross abuse and mishandling of Foundation assets, staff and assigned SCPs. Your site was directly inspected by a representative from the Ethics Committee. Under any normal circumstances, you would be put to death immediately, but the Council has deemed it important to allow you to explain yourself. 
&gt;  
&gt;   **Edwin:** Is that so? Here I was believing the anomaly had saved me too. 
&gt;   
&gt;   **O5-3:** Enough insubordination, Director. It is on your shoulders to dismiss the ethics review, so I suggest you start talking. 
&gt;  
&gt;   **Edwin:** Certainly sir. Mr. Vann was very thorough in his investigation, I am surprised his report was not even remotely slowed by the anomaly, but it is missing some vital information. Despite the conditions my staff face, we have learnt a significant amount from our work at Site-Ω1. 
&gt;  
&gt;   **O5-4:** Such as? 
&gt;  
&gt;  **Edwin:** Firstly and most importantly, the anomaly behaves in multiple ways. While our document states it has a stasis effect, our staff incidents show it also causes a loop. Now you may consider this a minor difference but the behaviour of the space time continuum when faced with stillness, compared when facing a cycle, is significant.  
&gt;  
&gt;  **O5-4:** And you believe this distinction was worth sacrificing lives over? 
&gt;  
&gt;  **Edwin:** What lives have I sacrificed sir? Site-Ω1 has minimal staff casualties. 
&gt;  
&gt;  **O5-4:** You know exactly what I refer to Edwin.   
&gt;  
&gt;  **Edwin:** Sir, we have never had an incident that is worth sacrificing our future for. 
&gt;  
&gt;  **O5-4:** I-
&gt;  
&gt;  **O5-7:** Four, please. What do you mean, our future?
&gt;  
&gt;  **Edwin:** I&#39;m sure you&#39;re used to the endless existential threats we deal with here, something capable of ending the human race gets found and caged up every day. It&#39;s easy to underestimate something that doesn&#39;t pose an imminent threat. 
&gt;  
&gt;  **O5-4:** Are you accusing us of negligence Director?
&gt;  
&gt;  **Edwin:** No sir. Think of it this way. There are many anomalies that we cage, some could doom us all. The human race stands on the edge of a cliff and many of those anomalies are more than capable of pushing us off. This is different. SCP-4121 is not humanity at the edge of a fall, humanity is clinging on by its fingers. Without my research, we are at 4121&#39;s mercy. We may stay like that forever, or we may fall when we least expect it. I ask you all here, now, which would you say is worse? 
&gt;  
&gt;  **O5-1:** ...you have made your case then, Director?
&gt;  
&gt;  **Edwin:** Have I made my case?
&gt;  
&gt;  **O5-1:** If that is all, your appeal will be reviewed by the Council now. 
&gt;  
&gt;  **Edwin:** My appeal? Did you even listen to a word I just said? 
&gt;  
&gt;  **O5-1:** Yes Edwin, we did. Do not try my patience. Guards, dismiss the accused. 
&gt; 
&gt;  //The Interviewed is dismissed.//
&gt; 
&gt;  **O5-4:** I don&#39;t like it, if we let this slide we&#39;re throwing away whatever human decency we still have. 
&gt; 
&gt;  **O5-1:** Yet we still must come to a verdict. Terminate the video. 
&gt; 
&gt;  **&lt;End Log&gt;**
