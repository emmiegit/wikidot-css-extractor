+++ ##blue|Black Queen Alliott Chao here.##
+++ ##red|bq [[[SCP-033|θ prime]]]##
+++ ##green|Sorry I&#39;m late, I&#39;m Black King Alistair. T&#39;s throwing off my ability to use blood magic a little.## 
+++ Director-General of the [[[goc-hub-page|World Parahealth Organisation]]] Dr. Allison Bailey-Chao. Let&#39;s get started.

----

++ Baseline

##blue|It&#39;s a mindfucker spread in the 2000s-2010s by neural-net produced pop music. Turns you into a gibbering fan of a non-existent artist and compels you to spread it despite being inevitably mediocre.## Keep the snark to the Instance sections. ##blue|It&#39;s //always// shit, though!## I&#39;m going to lock you out if you don&#39;t stop babbling.

++ Prerequisites

##green|Invention of a wide-spread musical culture, I guess?## ##red|don&#39;t take it for granted.## ##green|Sorry. Just seems kind of obvious to mention.## ##red|there is literally no air here to move to make sound. it is a non-trivial assumption.## ##green|Sorry, again, but... surely you have an equivalent?## ##red|slam poetry, but the point stands.##

Development of neural network technology, which implies computers and all the laws of physics you need for those to work. ##red|also, neural nets able to produce pop music in that time period? definitely some investment into parascience, either by hyperion labs or the heavisiders.## ##blue|Prometheus and the Maxwellists, for future reference.## ##red|oliver heaviside actually did most of the mathematical heavy lifting in your &#39;verse, maxwell can go eat a dick.##

++ Utility

##blue|Too unpredictable to capitalise on in most universes. Unless you&#39;ve got a taste for gibbering eldritch chamber pop or the worst &#34;worst fanbase&#34; I&#39;d probably stay away from it.## Hence why I&#39;m trying to quarantine it before it gets here. ##green|Plenty of resale value, though. Tons of weird music lovers lurking around the Library, one bought a volume of these things from me for a couple thousand dollars the other day.## ##blue|Just a couple thousand, at the risk of scrambling your brain?## ##green|Point taken.##

++ Vulnerability 

Amnestic stockpiles don&#39;t work. All it winds up doing is just causing spontaneous relapses when people unconsciously make cover versions. ##red|talk about cryptomnesia.## Only way to erase it from someone&#39;s mind for good is... well, see the A-198 section, and you&#39;ll see why I&#39;d rather not implement that cure.

----

+++ Instance: Timeline A-198

My first run-in with this particular disease, I assume it&#39;s still rampant. At the time I was with the Foundation&#39;s Multi-U department and we were negotiating for resources from a future Foundation: fifteen minutes into the meeting, everyone&#39;s phones go off. ##blue|Ringtone&#39;s the mind-fuck, I&#39;m guessing?## Yeah. We all get pulled out after the team back at base notice we&#39;re not responding to calls, and- ##red|so how&#39;d you get cured## -we get lobotomised shortly thereafter. ##red|they didn&#39;t have amnestics?## That&#39;s what we were trying to import. ##red|what the fuck## It was 1973, we were running kind of low from the eigenweapon debacle in the Middle East. It&#39;s also why I jumped universes as soon as I got informed about the whole &#34;being a Black Queen&#34; thing.

+++ Instance: Timeline B-293

##green|Extant. This one&#39;s spread as a remix instead of an original song.## ##blue|Really? Who of?## ##green|Included as a bonus track on Carly Rae Jepsen&#39;s E•MO•TION.## ##blue|Well, shit, now I have to go light a couple CDs on fire, hold on.## ##red|i&#39;m guessing the remixer was the non-existent one?## ##green|Yeah.## So the vector doesn&#39;t have to be an original composition. Interesting. ##green|I traced the file to a civilian neural net experiment designed to produce mashups on-demand. What I could check of the other stuff was kind of &#34;eh&#34; but not really anomalous, but I only got halfway through the robot&#39;s discography before I had to escape. Nearly got moshed to death by a bunch of fans on the way to the Library.## 

+++ Instance: Timeline V-983 

##blue|Defeated, or at least managed.## What? ##blue|Okay, it&#39;s not as easy as it sounds. Doctor named [[[SCP-3519|Rory Jones]]] gets assigned to memetic countermeasures, and it all shakes out in such a way that the only way to fight fire-## ##red|is with fire.## ##blue|Yeah. She released the [[[SCP-2112|Rush cover album]]] from containment, and the last time I popped in the Rush cover bands and the &#34;Calvary&#34; cover bands were still at war.## Calvary? ##blue|The non-artist.## Ah.

+++ Instance: Timeline C-102 

##red|richard d. james sunk a bunch of money into heuristic algorithms for his fifteenth album, and got the guys from this universe&#39;s version of [[[the-cool-war-hub|futanari titwhore fiasco]]] to handle the gruntwork on the neural net.## And what happened next? ##red|aphex twin. its just shitty off-brand aphex twin forever. its the fucking worst.## Ah. ##green|Wait, how do you hear if there&#39;s no air?## ##red|my dude i&#39;m a mathematical construct, i think i can do dsp alright.## ##green|...Oh.##

+++ Instance: Timeline Z-398

The current problem we&#39;re facing. This outbreak&#39;s started at a universe two Ways from my home, courtesy of a scrapped [[[the-bard-of-ambrose|philosophy AI]]], and I&#39;d like for us to have a solution before it does hit my baseline. ##blue|Well that&#39;s a little selfish.## If a cure works for one, it&#39;ll hopefully work for all the others. From what my associates tell me, it&#39;s an infectious number from a &#34;hit musical&#34; never released. It&#39;s been leaving people performing impromptu dance routines on the streets, which also serve as another vector for transmission, irritatingly enough. ##red|like, always the same musical number?## Yes. ##green|Maybe they&#39;re forming a musical hivemind?## ##blue|Clankies&#39;ll be happy about that one.## ##green|Okay, if you&#39;re gonna use Broken God slurs, at least use the one for the right sect, asshole.## It&#39;s plausible they might be forming a hivemind, yes. And knock off the bickering and the name-calling.

##red|hang on. what was it blue said about how they got it under control in the other universe?## ##blue|They released the Caress of Steel disc. I don&#39;t have a copy on me right now, and I&#39;m not eager to see how bad that&#39;ll fuck up this universe if the last one was anything to go by.## ##red|principle&#39;s the same, though, right? we just need a better earworm to replace the one they&#39;ve got right now.## ##blue|And how do you reckon we&#39;ll do that?## ##green|Form a band-## We&#39;re not going to form a band. ##blue|No, he&#39;s got a point. If the problem is that they&#39;re always fangasming about this one artist, either we knock them off the charts or we make them so sick of that artist they stop listening to it.##

##green|So how do we do that?## ##blue|We try both. I know where we could get some [[[the-skylarking-gala|musicians]]], and I reckon we could arrange for whoever this band is to take a public fall.## ##red|so you&#39;re saying, make a pr crisis for a fictional band.## ##blue|Bang on the money.## ##green|I think I can handle a fictional band.## ##blue|How?## 

##green|Want the lead singer to have an unfortunate fling with [[[SCP-423|Fred]]]?##</textarea></pre>
