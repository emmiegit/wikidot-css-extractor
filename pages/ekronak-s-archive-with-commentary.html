[[/module]]

You open an ornate wooden door, pushing it forward with as much strength as you can muster. It&#39;s heavy, but you just barely manage it as it gives way with a long //creeeeeeeeeeeak.//

The room within is dark and musty. You can barely see anything three feet in front of you, with only the orange lights from the empty street outside providing any illumination. You turn on your phone&#39;s flashlight, and are immediately greeted by a tall figure in a white cloak.

&#34;**Ah, greetings, dear hopeful peruser. What brings you here?**&#34; The figure asks. &#34;**I apologize for the state of the library, but ever since we began its renovations, it&#39;s always been... dilapidated, no matter what I do. I hope you forgive me.**&#34; The figure&#39;s voice carries a strange weight to it. It feels powerful and //ethereal//, yet casual all the same. It unnerves you.

The figure straightens up. &#34;**My name is Ecronak, by the way. I am the custodian of this place, boasting many articles from all over the known planes. I mostly curate files and tomes from the Foundation and its equivalents, but if you&#39;re patient, you may be able to find something else that interests you.**&#34;

[[=]]
The figure turns quickly. A lantern appears in his hand, conjured as if from thin air.

&#34;**Follow me.**&#34;

+++ Another Lost Legacy
[[/=]]

The first one I successfully put up on the site after... how many failed attempts? I&#39;ve tried to get many, **many** skips off the ground before this, and absolutely no tales. Then I finally got my first page up in one hour of writing and a few days of critiquing. In the form of my first tale draft. Goddamnit.

This one basically morphed from when I wanted to do exposition on a little concept from the Rat&#39;s Nest, and ended up with a little bit of gore and destruction tacked on in the end. Gotta be honest, still cringe when I read this, but ehhhhhhhhh... 

[[=]]
+++ Dire Tidings
[[/=]]

I built up to this one for days on end, not really solidifying my ideas in favor of mentally preparing myself for the creation of the story. Funnily enough, this story initially never had 239 in the first place- it was supposed to be a report on the state of the Doctors of the Church universe from the perspective of Alexylva! I must have spent a solid two hours working on the intro to that first concept, but after writer&#39;s block stymied any hope for me to get the actual story off the ground, I did another concept. What if we continue with the report concept, but take it from the perspective of a monk who&#39;s never had to deal with Alexylva? Then, I immediately took a U-turn, and thought &#34;What if we just take out Alexylva completely?&#34;

From there, I worked on the current concept for the tale, starting from a report by the (at-the-time unnamed) monk regarding a gigantic threat on the fringes of the Holy Foundation, then working from there. I first thought to make 3199 the all-encompassing threat, but rejected it when I remembered that I&#39;ve already done something with them in Lost Legacy. I did a quick search of skips from series 1, and came up with two that I&#39;d liked to include: 239, the witch, and 138, the catalyst character. Everything went fine until we hit the plot point of the witch&#39;s past and powers. Is she going to go super saiyan and rocket out of there to destroy the Foundation? Is she going to slowly remember her powers? Is she still held down by the spells? What of her backstory with Seth? Me spitballing the last half of the story isn&#39;t an exaggeration- I went ahead and did the first thing and then the second. The witch, I thought, was going to be powerful beyond belief. &#34;Kum Ihug&#34; was the corrupted Swedish word for remember, and I thought that Seth whispering it in her ear would be the one spell that would allow her to achieve full power. Then, she would rocket towards Arnven and destroy it, murdering every single Foundation Doctor that she came across.

But that was boring, and so I went back to the drawing board. In the end, I made it so that &#34;Kum Ihug&#34; would be the starting point for the witch&#39;s remembrance, but aside from a few fire spells, flying spells and healing spells, she wouldn&#39;t know a thing. When I went along with that plot point, I immediately got a hundred ideas at once for where I could take her character, and that&#39;s where I&#39;m going in the next installment. Should be a fun ride, since this entire thing might just be five parts long exploring the stuff that the Witch and Jaelen get up to. 

[[=]]
+++ Siggy and The Time All the Lights Went Dark Forever	
[[/=]]

Began the idea process for this tale with sort of a shower thought: If you think about it, both SCP-239 (The Witch Child) and SCP-2006 (Too Spooky) are two scips held down by lies. 239 is convinced that she can only use her powers through spells, meanwhile 2006 is deluded into thinking that what he actually does is scary. Both can be amazingly powerful beings, but they&#39;re held down by what the Foundation tells them.

So I rolled with it. Both 2006 and 239 are immature- 2006 out of a lack of experience, 239 because she&#39;s literally an eight year old. Through these two, I wanted to create a lighthearted sort of adventure that gets darker and darker as it draws on through the series- and yes, there is going to be a series. They&#39;ll both grow up, get more powerful, face down terrifying scips and people that test them and their relationship, and hopefully get out alive. It&#39;s gonna be fun, and I look forward to writing it.

Sidenote: I actually planned for this! Unlike the Arnven Chronicles, it&#39;s going to be 10 parts, with every 3 being part of a cohesive arc that introduces a character in some way. It&#39;s my first time using an actual outline for a series, which should be fun. Arnven suffered from a lack of foreplanning, which definitely hobbled the story some. There were some narrative events I could have done a better build-up to, and some characters (*cough* Siggy and Jaelen *cough*) that most definitely needed more cohesive arcs. I plan to try to rectify that in this series, and, the fates willing, I may succeed.

[[=]]
+++ Siggy Completely Trusts The Doctor That&#39;s Suddenly Turned Up
[[/=]]

In an update to that last commentary: I actually succeeded! Arc 1 was a success for all involved, and apparently it was really damn good. To that I say- shit! Thank you to everyone who read the tales and dooted, whether up or down. It was amazing to see a series of mine get that much good press and I feel really damn humbled by it all.

In regards to planning, I am happy to say it actually panned out well! I didn&#39;t follow the plan to the letter (actually, the entirety of Arc 1 deviated pretty heavily from the outline), but what ended up happening was so much better. Character development happened. I actually succeeded at horror. I did the characters of Seth and Clef justice! It was awesome all around, and I feel really excited about where else I can take the series- because yeah, I do have a plan, but if there&#39;s anything Arc 1 taught me, it&#39;s that plans never survive the story.

So to that end, let me lay out for you the original Arc 1 as written down during class after I put out Part 1:

Part 2 begins with a 939 encounter. No dialog, no cheese balls, just straight up 939. Seth saves them, Siggy feels shaken up because Robo couldn&#39;t do shit. Seth takes them to his home, and infodumps them in a way similar to what happened in Part 3.

Part 3 begins with Clef meeting up with them. He acts strangely, wanting to get his hands on 239 so that he can finally get the hell out of dodge. While everyone&#39;s distracted, he jumps up, dismembers Seth, and attacks Siggy. Robo tries to scare him, obviously doesn&#39;t work, Siggy almost dies, but Seth&#39;s dismembered hand holds Clef down enough for Siggy to blast him in the face.

Part 4 starts with Robo and Siggy (no mention of Seth) arguing over why Robo can&#39;t protect her. Robo doesn&#39;t know why, melodrama ensues, and then a blinded Clef comes back, stabs Robo, and is about to kill Siggy with the sword. Robo transforms behind him, hits him, and they both run away.

So uh... Yeah. Pretty anticlimactic, right? No final 939 fight, no true Seth death, no cheese balls, and we don&#39;t get the resolution of Robo being a literal fucking coward. Looking at this, I&#39;m honestly happy at how much Arc 1 deviated from the outline, giving birth to an amazing finale that ends with real consequences and a chance for Siggy, Robo, and Clef to develop as characters.

Arc 2 will, spoilers, start with Siggy at 11 and about to explore the settlements on the upper floors, which presents a lot of really good story opportunities- Siggy&#39;s never seen a boy before. She&#39;s seen men, doctor men, but not boys. Robo has the opportunity to act all paternal towards her. We get to explore the settlement&#39;s disposition towards skips, and what they&#39;ll do the duo if they find out. We&#39;ll finally get to meet Lana- and boy, do I have plans for her.

[[=]]
+++ A New World Beckons, and It&#39;s Filled with Death Chickens
[[/=]]

Okay, so let me just go ahead and say it: As time passes by, the original outline gets more and more fucked.

Arc 2 was in many ways planned to be the bridge between the childish adventures of Arc 1 and the maturity of Arc 3. It was supposed to deal with dealing with the past, with growing as a result of it, and then moving past that. The original outline was in many ways still a kid&#39;s story, and as time passed and Arc 1 developed more and more there seemed to be less and less of a push to continue with that. So, at the literal start of Arc 2, I introduced someone that was never meant to be in the series: Alina. She&#39;s what I&#39;d like to call the Seth of Arc 2, but in essence she&#39;s so much more than that. She gave the two a gateway into what would be the rest of the story, with a greater focus on things that //aren&#39;t// Siggy and Robo, which includes Lana, Alina, Chancey, and Clef. 

Speaking of those characters, Lana wasn&#39;t supposed to be the flawed bitch that she ended up being. In the outline, I&#39;d envisioned for her to be someone that fights //against// Clef, and not with him. She didn&#39;t have Bothild, she didn&#39;t rule over Greattown- in fact, she was basically someone who lived outside of it, waiting for the day when Siggy comes.

Now, that&#39;s most definitely an Arc 1 way of looking at things- chosen ones, morally important parental figures, black and white fights. But, honestly, as the arc wore on, I found that I didn&#39;t want that. I didn&#39;t want Clef to be that villain that hunts down the dastardly pair from Part 4 till 10. I wanted him to be more nuanced, to grow as a character, to live and breathe as his own man. So that&#39;s what I did. I introduced a bunch of grey areas, and put everyone inside of it. I guess, accidentally, it signals Siggy&#39;s coming of age in the world within the Site- she&#39;s not a little kid anymore. She needs to grow. And for her to grow, that means being rejected, having to face her inner (bear) demons, and having to come to terms with the fact that not everything is going to be as she envisioned.

Additional note: Lana was always supposed to die in this arc. Whether it was as a dying parental figure in the original draft, or as the bitch that she is in the final version, she was always supposed to die- first to a wound dealt by Clef or some other Greattowner, and then to the fire that Siggy casts on her; but sometimes, like I said, things don&#39;t go as envisioned, and so Lana will be back in some form or another in Arc 3- because it&#39;s more interesting for her to live on with what Siggy had but worse than to kill her off entirely. Plus, three more years to reflect on what she did will make tying off the loose ends in Arc 3 that more satisfying.

[[=]]
+++ The Witch Returns
[[/=]]

So, here are- nearly a month and ten parts later. Been an amazing ride.

Siggy and RoboMonkey for me was a challenge to see how far I could take two characters, with only them being the main focus of the entire series. It was an attempt to do character development properly, to do my characters justice for once, and with all of it done... I can say that I&#39;ve succeeded. Somewhat.

Long-form stories like these are always tricky in that you always have regrets about what to do with this and what was done with that, like the fact that I&#39;ve done too much Siggy and not enough Robo, or how Arc 2 felt a bit too cramped for what it was, or how many missed opportunities there were in Arc 3 compared to say, Arc 1. These issues are bound to always pop up when you only have limited parts and only 8k words max to say them, but... honestly? I think it&#39;s good enough.

Over the course of the story, we&#39;ve seen Siggy grow up. We&#39;ve seen Robo mature. We&#39;ve seen Clef go from composed to insane. We&#39;ve seen Lana as she really was. All of these characters, at the very least, have developed more than any other set of characters that I&#39;ve written, and I think that&#39;s amazing. Could I have done better? Most fucking definitely. But do I think that it was bad? Not really, at least not as much as say, Arnven. I still got a lot to learn, and that&#39;s alright- the amount of lessons that I&#39;ve gotten from this series alone is staggering.

So, to sum up: It&#39;s been a long damn ride, and I&#39;m proud that it&#39;s gotten this far. There may or may not be Arc 4. There may or may not be stand-alone stories. But from here... it&#39;s great to say that Siggy and Robo are finally free in a way that feels earned. 

And that&#39;s what counts.

I HAVE DONE IT! MY FIRST SCP! WHOOOO!

Celebration aside, this one has been a long time coming- and I don&#39;t mean the four years of straight tales before that. When I was still on my old account (Freddybeard, since lost access), I&#39;d tried out a lot of different things to make an SCP work. Since I was like, 12 at the time, it was doomed to fail. That was exactly what happened when I put up the &#34;Picasso Virus&#34;, which was deleted in no time flat for being utterly crap.

That was the last straw for young me, which caused me to fuck off the site for about two years, when I started putting up tales rather than SCPs. The idea for a painting virus still persisted though, and when the time finally came for me to write up an SCP, those two words still stayed with me.

So I pushed through with it. The Picasso virus- which soon turned into the Beksinski virus, and then morphed into the SCP-5397 that we can all see today.

Not gonna lie, this got me thinking. What does one expect out of Memecon? Fun and laughter? Inversions on the meme that an entry is based on? Just random shit? Honestly, what the hell do I fucking write?

Well, I always knew I wanted to do an &#34;I am the Senate&#34; entry. That was the first thing that came into my mind, so I started drafting it up- it would be telling the story of a bunch of blobs which were created from legislative assemblies eventually forming a gigantic Palpatine head. The meme was the punchline, that of &#34;I am the Senate.&#34;

But when I showed it to a bunch of intrepid critters, they didn&#39;t really warm up to it. It felt too… Memecon-y, with lots of jokes but not enough seriousness, especially for the political subject matter that the meme implied. So I went back to the drawing board. Got suggestions for a more serious direction. After half an hour of trying to write up those suggestions, I gave up and decided to have fun with my own direction instead.

Half-tale, half-skip. Half-serious, half-funny. Bam. That was what happened to the final idea, and it went from there. Suddenly my mind bursted with creative energy, allowing me to type up everything in the space of a few hours. Seeing how it&#39;s doing now… heh, I guess it worked. Not as well as other entries, mind, but it worked.

Previously, I had resolved to stay off of the wiki after my yearly phase was done- something that I had held to for years, up until this one. After narrowly missing submitting for 6k, I decided that I wouldn&#39;t miss another competition again. Hence, this, months away from my yearly phase to submit for Nightmarefest. Not as bad as I expected, I admit.

The ideation process for this took a really long damn time. I first thought of doing Graveyard Shift and going with the idea of people being buried and being the harbingers for some sort of apocalypse, drawing on a previous horror idea that also inspired 5421. Wrote up a draft, didn&#39;t work. Went back to the drawing board soon after.

With no other ideas to use, and the burying idea still oozing with potential, I decided to do a warm-up skip, making an article with as little words as possible. A few hours later, I came up with 6770, which was immediately met with much success. It was something that I felt happy with, but I didn&#39;t feel entirely satisfied. After all, the resulting article was more sad than scary, and I still didn&#39;t have anything to submit for Nightmarefest.

So I drew on another thing that scared the bejeebers out of me- being lined up and executed quickly and unceremoniously. Now, this may be odd to many of you, but with life in my country being what it is, the thought of being shot in the middle of the street was always on the back of my mind. Drawing on that, I wrote another draft- and this time, it was met with far more success.

Not to say that it hit the ball out of the park on the first outing, mind you. The draft went through so many iterations that it stunned me, nearly pushing me to abandon the endeavor entirely multiple times. Still, keeping my oath in mind, I decided to push through with it. Truthfully, I was having doubts with the quality of the article up until its submission, which was thankfully ended when I decided to say &#34;FUCK IT!&#34; and posted it. With the success it&#39;s getting now, I&#39;m grateful to see it thrive, with people identifying with the helplessness and pointlessness found inside the skip.

&#34;I&#39;M IN YOUR WALLS&#34; says the Scrimblo Catalog.

In the words of the Watcher from &#34;What If?&#34;, that was the moment that created a new --universe-- SCP.

Immediately, I had an idea of what this skip would entail, so I immediately sprinted to the SCPDeclassified Discord and laid the idea onto two people: Jack Waltz and Leah. Now, the premise then was simple: Girl is hidden away by paranoid mother, girl has extreme gigantism, girl turns into a wall of flesh in the shape of her house, girl wakes up and demands &#34;MEAT.&#34; Pretty simple, pretty disturbing, pretty fucked up. Through the normal process of taking a draft through the chat hivemind, what would become 6670 started to become clear. When all that was done, I immediately took it into the shop, writing everything up until Jemma&#39;s entrapment and then creating the rest later.

I&#39;m not going to spare a single influence when I go through this next part: Imagine if I took the Scrimblo Catalog, analog horror, All Tomorrows, Amigara Fault, and my own anxieties as an aspiring parent and mixed them all up into one royally fucked soup of an article. That&#39;s 6770. Seeing the fact that I couldn&#39;t sleep the week before because of the nightmarefuck that is the Mandela Catalogue, I think I channeled more than a few demons into this article than usual- it&#39;s definitely not a coincidence that the entire thing takes place in the 90s, and on tapes.
