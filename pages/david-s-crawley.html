&gt; {{A New Urban Explorer[[footnote]] Found left on a reading table in the Art Section. It appears Mr. Crawley is serialising his excursions and interactions with the Library. [[/footnote]]}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Panel 1: DAVE wandering through a city. A contemporary city, fuck it, it&#39;s Leeds.}} 
&gt; 
&gt; {{DAVE CAPTION: Home sweet home... Shame I leave all the time...}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Panel 2: Dave is in shadow as a glowing door opens in front of him.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{CAPTION: Although, I&#39;ve been lots of new places. Which is cool.}} 
&gt; 
&gt; {{Panel 3: He&#39;s now in a mystical medieval city, with a large monster advertising Coke walking by.}} 
&gt; 
&gt; {{--Panel 4: He&#39;s walking across a building, which is jutting out of sheer vertical cliff-face along with the rest of a city. He&#39;s seems quite content.--}} 
&gt; 
&gt; {{Panel 5: He&#39;s fighting off what looks like a demonic MLP-esque biscuit unicorn with a giant broken stick of Rainbow Dust, other monstrous confectionaries are nearby.}} 
&gt; 
&gt; {{Panel 6: A bizarre, almost Mega-City 1 looking city. There are giants wandering round too.}} 
&gt; 
&gt; {{CAPTION: Although some places are just weird.}} 
&gt; 
&gt; {{PAGE 2:}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Panel 1: Dave is in the Mega-City, hanging off a billboard with a spray-can in his hand. We don&#39;t see what he&#39;s drawn.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{CAPTION: And sometimes I really just have to leave a mark.}} 
&gt; 
&gt; {{Panel 2: We see the billboard now, it is an arcane looking symbol wrapped in graffiti-tag. One of the giants is looking at it.}} 
&gt; 
&gt; {{CAPTION: Yeah, art-magic&#39;s fun. I&#39;ve basically drawn something which shows everyone who sees it, exactly what they need to see.}} 
&gt; 
&gt; {{Panel 3: The giant is enraged, red lighting flares from it&#39;s mouth and eyes.}} 
&gt; 
&gt; {{CAPTION: ...Only some people don&#39;t like it...}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Panel 4: He&#39;s in another city now, where the buildings all look like giant statues with windows. There is a tag on the wall, another arcane looking symbol. This one is a stylised &#39;L&#39; and an 87.}} 
&gt; 
&gt; {{CAPTION: You can probably tell where I&#39;ve been, and I&#39;ve been everywhere.}} 
&gt; 
&gt; {{Panel 5: Dave looking at a card in his hand.}} 
&gt; 
&gt; {{CAPTION: I even got a special card for a library somewhere...}}
