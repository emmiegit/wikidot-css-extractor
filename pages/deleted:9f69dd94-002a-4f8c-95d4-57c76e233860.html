SCP-6838 Also has a supernatural ability to dig, being able to dig through Steel a meter thick within 2 weeks
SCP-6838s eyes Are extremely alluring, if you are to look at SCP-6838 eyes for more then 4.62 seconds you will spontaneously flop on the floor and believe you are a snake(From now on these people will be referred to as SCP-6838-2). 
Once Under the effects of SCP-6838, it can communicate to SCP-6838-2 from anywhere.

controlled by SCP-6838-2. If SCP-6838 is to fall asleep or hurt to near death, SCP-6838-2 will stop effecting its subjects.

SCP-6838 is extremely Kind, Docile and well-going unless it has been outright denied something it asks for without being taken into consideration by the facility which leads to its vindictive behaviors.

D-class personnel have often experienced fulfilling conversations with SCP-6838 during tests.

**Addendum 6838.1 :** Post update to the Scramblers used to re-contain sight based Cognito-hazards, A task force re-containing another SCP had not realized SCP-6838 had breached Containment due to their attention being held by other sources. Their loss of focus on SCP-6838 had lead to their detriment. After it had breached containment the MTF was close tore-containing the other SCP when SCP-6838 had came up behind them. They all had noticed SCP-6838 Due to it being extremely Alluring. they all locked eyes with it and couldn&#39;t
Avoid its deep gaze. One by one they all flopped on the floor believing they where snakes. The unnamed SCP had noticed SCP-6838s presence and took advantage of that.
The MTF squad was slowly murdered by prior mention Unnamed SCP.
