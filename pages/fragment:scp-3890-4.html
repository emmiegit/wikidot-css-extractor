    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Item #:** SCP-3890

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Myself and Tony are to remain within our current shelter at all times. We have agreed on a password system to confirm our identities to each other. We are to sleep in shifts and watch for the mimic at all times.

**Description:** The crying was a child, Tony, ten years old. Not the mimic. The mimic can&#39;t speak. It just attacks silently.

According to Tony, he was walking home from the playground when he was transported here. It&#39;s a similar story to mine. Is there some connection with travelling and being taken to this place, or is that part just a coincidence? Perhaps the mimic somehow changes our destination to this place en route. Metaphysically, I mean.

I don&#39;t know what the fuck I&#39;m talking about. Or maybe I do, and I forgot.

Tony is asleep right now. We&#39;ve barely spoken - of course, the kid is traumatized - but I almost forgot how it feels not to be alone. Not to be hunted. Well, we&#39;re still being hunted, of course, but now we&#39;re being hunted together. --Now it can get us both-- Now we can watch for it together. Our chances of survival have doubled.

Survival isn&#39;t the thing we&#39;re fighting for, of course. The mimic doesn&#39;t want to kill us, just empty out our heads. I don&#39;t even know if people age here. How long have the other people, the wandering ones, been here? Years? Decades? Centuries? I should have examined them more closely before hiding myself away in some bank. I&#39;m a doctor, for god&#39;s sake, even if I can&#39;t remember all my training.

My name is Doctor Elizabeth Graham. My name is Doctor Elizabeth Graham. My name is Doctor Elizabeth Graham.

I have this memory from my childhood, still. Everything around it is gone, but it&#39;s sort of floating free, devoid of context. I&#39;m visiting a woman in a hospital, I think it&#39;s a hospital, and I think it&#39;s a woman I know. A close relative? My mother or my grandmother, I think. And I go to visit her, I&#39;m just a kid, twelve I think, and she doesn&#39;t know who I am. At all. I don&#39;t remember what happened before that or after.

I do remember thinking that that was the worst thing in the world. 

Was that why it brought me here, the mimic? Because it knew this would be something I&#39;d hate the most? I know it must be intelligent, but is it sadistic as well?

I&#39;ll ask Tony tomorrow if he has a similar memory. Then, hopefully, I&#39;ll be a little closer to working out the rules of this place. Whatever&#39;s going on [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3890/offset/4 |here]]], I&#39;m going to beat it. If you&#39;re reading this, you fucker, I&#39;m going to beat //you//.</textarea></pre>
