I stood nervously before the desk. Although I&#39;d met the Intelligence Operations Regional Director once before, when I first transferred into the department, I&#39;d never had to deliver a report to someone this high up the chain of command before. It was a less than pleasant experience.

Director Jameson looked up from the smart-phone she had been handling, turned it to face me, and said, &#34;So, Agent Beard, please explain what I&#39;m seeing here.&#34; On the screen of the phone was a large circles-and-arrows logo, with &#34;Special Containment Protocols. How safe do you feel?&#34; printed below it.

&#34;Well, ma&#39;am, I was looking for an app on my personal phone and decided to look up a few Foundation keywords as a joke. Unfortunately, as you can see, there actually was an app out there. At $14.99, it&#39;s more expensive than most apps, which we hope may have limited the number of people downloading it, but until we complete analysis of the involved databases, we won&#39;t know for certain how many copies are out there.&#34;

She placed the phone on the desk and steepled her fingers as she looked at me. &#34;And how extensive is the breach?&#34;

I held my hands behind my back, absently noticing that my palms were getting sweaty. &#34;It contains heavily redacted protocols for about 450 items, mostly classified as Safe, and a couple of other internal documents, including a handful of personnel files.&#34; I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. &#34;One of them is an almost fully unexpunged file on Dr. Bright.&#34;

Director Jameson&#39;s brow furrowed slightly as she briefly closed her eyes and sighed heavily. &#34;Can these files be traced to any given Site?&#34;

&#34;The most likely origin of the leak is the central data hub in-&#34; The phone buzzed, interrupting me. Director Jameson picked it up, tapped the screen a couple of times, then slid it over to me.

There was an update to the app, advertising &#34;37 new Items! New pictures for 17 old Items! UI upgrade! New submission form to report any Items you find out in the wild!&#34;

Director Jameson&#39;s voice grew harsh and her eyes grew cold as she said, &#34;Coordinate with Internal Security and locate the source of this leak. I don&#39;t care if you have to crash Apple&#39;s servers, but get that app off the market immediately and locate anyone who got a copy. I want a weekly summary on your progress. Dismissed.&#34;

I picked up the phone and left the room, glad that I wasn&#39;t getting blamed for the breach. Yet, anyway. And here I thought that transferring from field intel duty would be less stressful.
