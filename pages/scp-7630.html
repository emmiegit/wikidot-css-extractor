-----
All live instances of SCP-7630 are to be held in Biological Containment Chamber 25-C in Wing-G of Site-39. Personnel interacting with instances of SCP-7630 or infected patients must follow Class-B (BSL-3) HAZMAT/biosafety procedures. 

Currently, no known instances of SCP-7630 exist outside of Foundation containment. However, in the event of a widespread breach, Emergency Response Command Team Theta-5 is to immediately attempt to contain the breach and decontaminate all affected areas.

+++ {{**DESCRIPTION** }}
[[/=]]
-----
SCP-7630 is a small parasitic organism, resembling a box jellyfish. The organism primarily targets human hosts, entering the body through the nose or mouth. SCP-7630 resides within the brain of its host, placing its &#34;arms&#34; around the temporal and parietal lobes. The parasite consumes the host&#39;s cerebrospinal fluid and gray matter, causing amnesia and confusion, and eventually brain death. Once infected, SCP-7630 cannot be removed by surgical means, as doing so would fatally damage the host&#39;s brain. After approximately 1-2 days post-infection, SCP-7630 will lay its eggs within the spinal cord and neck. SCP-7630 eggs can be spread via bodily fluids and airborne particles. The host will enter a comatose state after 2-4 days, and typically dies after 3-5 days.

SCP-7630 is able to generate electrical charges in the brain using its &#34;arms&#34;, allowing it to communicate with its human host. Subjects infected by SCP-7630 describe a voice speaking to them inside their own heads. See **ADDENDA** for more information.

On 2026/02/04, Dr. Emily Rossella was infected with an instance of SCP-7630 during a laboratory accident. She immediately fell unconscious and was moved to Site-39&#39;s hospital wing. The following transcript of a medical examination conducted by Dr. Alexander Lambert was recorded the next day.

**ROSSELLA:** We&#39;ve known each other for so long, please just--

**LAMBERT:** What&#39;s started?

**ROSSELLA:** The voice. It&#39;s so much more... //vivid// than I imagined. Nobody was alive long enough to tell us what it was like.

**LAMBERT:** What is it like?

**ROSSELLA:** It&#39;s quiet. Really quiet. It&#39;s like a voice in my head that I... can&#39;t control. //[Pauses.]// It&#39;s a little squeaky, too.

**LAMBERT:** Can you understand what it&#39;s saying?

**ROSSELLA:** Not really. It&#39;s getting clearer, but... I&#39;ll tell you when I start hearing it. I&#39;ve got some... stuff I want to test. 

**LAMBERT:** Are you sure? You don&#39;t have to do this.

**ROSSELLA:** I-- no, no, yeah, I&#39;m sure. There&#39;s, well... no better opportunity.

**LAMBERT:** I appreciate your dedication, Emily.

**ROSSELLA:** It&#39;s not about research, Alex. It&#39;s just...

**LAMBERT:** No. No. I understand.

//[Silence.]//

**ROSSELLA:** So much for professionalism now, huh?

//[LAMBERT smiles.]//

**ROSSELLA:** Before you go, there was something I wanted to ask you.

**LAMBERT:** Yes?

**ROSSELLA:** Is there any way I could see Isabella? Before, you know...

//[LAMBERT sighs.]//

**ROSSELLA:** I know, I know. Procedure.

Later that day, at around 14:02 UTC, Dr. Rossella requested the use of a Greene-Atkinson Neural Oscillatory Parser (GANOP).[[footnote]]The Greene-Atkinson Neural Oscillatory Parser is a device capable of transcribing the internal thoughts of a subject. See Greene &amp; Atkinson, 1998.[[/footnote]] After being installed, the following log was recorded.

**ROSSELLA:** I thought you knew as much as I do.

**SCP-7630:** You don&#39;t think he&#39;s trying hard enough? You think he owes that to you?

**ROSSELLA:** I&#39;m not selfish, but... you&#39;d think he could at least //try//.

**SCP-7630:** He doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s doing, you know.

**ROSSELLA:** What do you mean?

**SCP-7630:** I mean that he&#39;s never done this before. He&#39;s seen people die before, sure, but not... you know, a //friend//.

**ROSSELLA:** You think he&#39;s a friend?

**SCP-7630:** Hey, I only know as much as you.

**ROSSELLA:** I suppose you&#39;re right.

//[Silence.]//



**SCP-7630:** Well, given my analysis of all your thoughts and memories...

**ROSSELLA:** Yeah?

**SCP-7630:** I think you did one hell of a good job as a mother, given your... //situation//.

**ROSSELLA:** You really think that?

**SCP-7630:** I only know as much as you. You&#39;re a mother. You judge yourself too harshly.

**ROSSELLA:** Since when did you become a psychologist?

//[Silence. Quiet sobbing.]//

**ROSSELLA:** Do you think she&#39;ll still love me? I don&#39;t want her to hate me, I don&#39;t...

**SCP-7630:** I think she&#39;s going to resent you.

**ROSSELLA:** Fuck you.

**SCP-7630:** But I know she&#39;ll still love you. When she grows up she&#39;ll understand.

**ROSSELLA:** //[In between gasps.]// How? She-- she doesn&#39;t know-- know any of this.

**SCP-7630:** Truth finds a way.

**ROSSELLA:** You know that&#39;s not true.

//[Silence.]//

**SCP-7630:** Hopeful optimism?

**ROSSELLA:** Hope-- hopeful optimism.

**LAMBERT:** Emily?

//[ROSSELLA stirs. She groggily opens her eyes.]//

**ROSSELLA:** Who are you?

**LAMBERT:** It&#39;s me. Alex.

//[Silence.]//

**LAMBERT:** How are you feeling?

**ROSSELLA:** Numb. Where’s my hands?

//[LAMBERT pulls ROSSELLA’s hands up from her bed. She does not react.]//

**LAMBERT:** They’re right here, Em. Right here.

**ROSSELLA:** Thirsty.

**LAMBERT:** We’ve already upped your fluids.

//[Silence.]//

**ROSSELLA:** There’s— there’s an episode of Saul I haven’t finished. F— finish it for me, will— will you?

**LAMBERT:** Of— of course. Anything else?

**ROSSELLA:** Tell Izzy I love her. Tell her... to be good to her dad. Tell her I&#39;m sorry.

//[Silence.]//

//[Visible via the GANOP is an inky black void, in which ROSSELLA floats. She is wearing a blue dress. A blue jellyfish hovers beside her, periodically expanding and contracting its bell. At ROSSELLA&#39;s feet, a [[[nothing|white cloud]]] begins to form, small at first but rapidly expanding.]//

//[Slowly, the cloud begins to transform into a small room, similar in appearance to a child&#39;s bedroom. A pink bed lies in one corner while the other is decorated with pictures and drawings of various animals, mostly elephants. In the center of the room stands a small girl, no older than ten, wearing a similar blue dress as ROSSELLA&#39;s.]//

**ROSSELLA:** I-- Isabella? Izzy?

**GIRL:** Mom?

**ROSSELLA:** It&#39;s you. It&#39;s-- it&#39;s really you. I missed you so--

//[The girl runs towards ROSSELLA and embraces her tightly. ROSSELLA hugs her back and places her head on her shoulder.]//

**GIRL:** Where were you?

**ROSSELLA:** Mommy was working, sweetie. She was working. But mommy&#39;s back now.

//[Silence.]//

**ROSSELLA:** Mommy&#39;s back. And she loves you so much.

**GIRL:** I love you too.

**ROSSELLA:** Be good to dad, won&#39;t you?

**GIRL:** Always.

**ROSSELLA:** And be good to yourself, too, okay? Whenever things get hard just know... just know that mommy&#39;s there with you. And she loves you.

**GIRL:** I will.

//[Silence.]//

**GIRL:** I love you.

//[The pair seperate. Tears are visible in ROSSELLA&#39;s eyes, as the girl and the bedroom slowly transform back into the cloud. ROSSELLA stands still for a moment, before turning to the jellyfish beside her.]//

**ROSSELLA:** Thank you.
