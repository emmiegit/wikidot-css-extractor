&gt; This page will be purged regularly. If your log is rejected or doesn&#39;t adhere to the correct format, make sure to save a copy yourself if you want to try again.

----

++++ How to write a 914 test log:

Guidelines for future entries can be found [[[scp-914-experiment-log-guidelines|here]]]. The FAQ is located at the bottom of [[[experiment-log-914-hub|this page]]].

All test logs should be written in the following form. Please include your researcher&#39;s name on all records, along with the date formatted in European standard and a list of the total number of items &#34;refined.&#34;

&gt; @@**Name:**@@
&gt; @@**Date:** DD/MM/YYYY@@
&gt; @@**Total Items:**@@
&gt; @@@@
&gt; @@**Input:**@@
&gt; @@**Setting:**@@
&gt; @@**Output:**@@

If you want to add a note to a log that has already been ported over, copy the number of the test log and the output/note before it into the following template:

&gt; @@**Suggested note for Test-XXXX**@@
&gt; @@[Section before suggested note]@@
&gt; @@[Your note]@@

----

++++ How this sandbox works:

* [[*user Leveritas]] (me) will regularly check this page, selecting logs that are of sufficient quality to add to the log and port them over.
* Tests that fail to adhere to the proper format (date, etc.) will **not** be ported until fixed.
* Ownership of content posted to the 914 log is retained by log curators as stewards over any content therein. As such, any authors contributing to the logs cede any future claims to said content to the collaboration log curator.

----

++++ Regarding 914&#39;s rules and guidelines:

SCP-914 does not create or destroy matter, nor does it change anything on the atomic level. All outputs should contain all and only the matter included in the input. Some grandfathered entries break this rule, but new entries should never do so. We call this Conservation of Mass.

Do note that in case you intent to break a [[[scp-914-experiment-log-guidelines|guideline]]] other than CoM, your test has to make up for it in quality.

----

++++ Regarding in-universe names:

It is generally seen as bad form to use other writers&#39; characters without asking. Of course, the rules of the wiki do not prohibit this, but asking beforehand will never hurt anyone.

+++++ If you&#39;re not comfortable with your in-universe name being used, politely request a change or come to me about it.

----

++++ Regarding unprofessionalism in the logs

Some of you might have noticed that I&#39;m being harsher on notes and logs that I deem too LOLFoundation. To illustrate my point, I&#39;m going to use an example from Part IV:

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Half-Life 3?&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]

**Name:** Jr. Researcher Redmar
**Date:** 20/03/2019
**Total Items:** One CD containing “Half Life” for PC

**Input:** Mentioned above
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** An extremely bright light consisting of [REDACTED] Lumens, which faded after 15 seconds, revealing a CD with the cover art resembling that of Half Life 2, but the 2 was replaced with 3. When inserted into a disk drive, an image with the word: “NOPE” appeared on screen, followed by a noise resembling human laughter.

//Note: Jr. Researcher Redmar has requested reassignment. Granted. - Dr. Veritas//

[[/collapsible]]

I actually edited the note. This is what it originally was:

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Half Life 3? Original&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]

**Name:** Jr. Researcher Redmar
**Date:** 20/03/2019
**Total Items:** One CD containing “Half Life 2” for PC

**Input:** Mentioned above
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** An extremely bright light consisting of [REDACTED] Lumens, which faded after 15 seconds, revealing a CD with the cover art resembling that of Half Life 2, but the 2 was replaced with 3. When inserted into a disk drive, an image with the word: “NOPE” appeared on screen, followed by a noise resembling human laughter.

//Note: Fuck you, 914 - Jr. Researcher Redmar//

[[/collapsible]]

This is a very small difference, but it makes a world of difference in tone. The first entry works a lot better because it&#39;s not a researcher scolding the machine outright as a kid would. It&#39;s **implying** (read, show don&#39;t tell) that the researcher became so fed up with the result that he outright left. Wacky entries work well if it&#39;s against the cold professionalism that signifies the Foundation, and it **doesn&#39;t work** if it looks like the employees are acting just as unprofessional. Notes that enforce such excessive or LOLFoundation behaviour will be removed.

----

++++ Other things:

* No more introduction notes. 914 is supposed to be unpredictable, and there’s only so many times it can turn handwriting into different handwriting or a drawing before you start predicting it.
* Don&#39;t link outside of SCP wiki pages (crosslinks to other SCPs/Tales/GoI formats are ok). The reason for this are in-universe and out-of universe for different reasons:
 * In-universe, it&#39;s not professional conduct to link to anything outside Foundation intranet if that&#39;s not part of your job. On top of that, anyone can edit something like Wikipedia, and the Foundation would not rely on it as an reliable information source.
 * Out-of-universe, it&#39;s immersion breaking. Please write a short description of the concept instead. This way, it doesn&#39;t require the reader to read a Wikipedia article where a short description would have done the job.

------------------------
**Name:** Junior Researcher Elwin
**Date:** 26/04/2022
**Items:** Three nylon flags of the type used by color guard in various colors on 1.8 meter aluminum poles

//Note: Color guard, for those of you who don&#39;t know, is basically dancing, but with big flags. For this test, I&#39;ll be using &#34;tall&#34; flags. - JR Elwin//

**Input:** One black flag
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One thinner aluminum pole a meter in length attached to a vaguely triangular flag two meters in length, with aluminum threads woven into the fabric. The flag is patterned with gears.

//Note: I&#39;m keeping this once it passes memetic screening, it&#39;s actually really pretty. - JR Elwin//

**Input:** One blue flag
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One flag identical to input, but floating in midair. Testing reveals that it maintains its position until moved by a force other than gravity.

//Note: It was fun for a few minutes, but a flag that doesn&#39;t come back down when you toss it is rather pointless. Can someone with a ladder come get it off the ceiling? - JR Elwin//

**Input:** One red flag
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One autonomously spinning flag that constantly performs a simple color guard routine while anomalously levitating about a meter off the ground. When security forces attempted to grab it, it continued attempting to spin until it was forcibly shoved into the incinerator.

------------------------

**Name:** Researcher N. Reyblanc
**Date:** 04/05/2022
**Total Items:** One complete collection of nine //Star Wars, the Skywalker Saga// DVDs.

**Input:** One collection of DVDs
**Setting:** Fine
 **Output:** One collection of DVDs with anomalous storage capacities. DVDs contain security footage of all security cameras of Site-19 Facility 23 every May 4th since 1978. Every human that appears on screen is replaced by a //Star Wars// character. Bonuses include an exhaustive and in-depth technical &#34;making of&#34; video presented by Site Director Hackett and a teaser for &#34;A Brand New Saga, coming September 14th&#34;.

//Note: The weirdest thing is that there is footage of Site 19 before Facility 23 was built, when the cameras did not exist. Maybe I should watch the making of to see how they did that. - Researcher N. Reyblanc//

----
**Name:** Junior Researcher G.H. Elwin
**Date:** 06/05/2022
**Total Items:** Six //Warhammer 40,000// space marine miniatures, painted in an assortment of colors.

**Input:** One marine painted in Imperial Fist colors
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Identical to input. On retrieval, D-08916 was suddenly affected by a strong compulsion to &#34;fortify this position,&#34; using whatever materials are at hand and displaying an unprecedented degree of skill. Placed in Anomalous Storage.

//Note: This fits, since in lore the Imperial Fists&#39; shtick is fortifications. - JR Elwin//

**Input:** One marine painted in Space Wolf colors
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Identical to input, but has the wolf property of wolfing anyone who wolfs it to rewolf its wolf-tongue to wolf. Incinerated.

//Wolf: I&#39;d wolf, but... well, wolf. - JR Elwin//

**Input:** One marine painted in Ultramarine colors
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A plastic purity seal that, when worn, causes the wearer to refer to MT Johnson as their &#34;spiritual liege.&#34; Incinerated with extreme prejudice.

//Note: So the Ultramarines, or &#34;Ultrasmurfs&#34;, &#34;Blueberries&#34;, or what-have-you are known for referring to their Primarch, (Giant demigod son of the Emperor) Roboute Guilliman, as their &#34;Spiritual Liege.&#34; Probably because they can&#39;t pronounce his name. With that out of the way, time to move on to some Chaos Space Marines. - JR Elwin//

**Input:** One marine painted in World Eaters colors
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** An animate figure that attempted to kill anyone within range. It is incapable of actually harming anyone, due to being made of plastic and five centimeters tall.

//Note: The World Eaters are basically just &#34;KILL KILL KILL BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD STAB STAB STAB&#34;, so this seems appropriate. - JR Elwin//

**Input:** One marine painted in Thousand Sons colors
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A plastic icon of Tzeentch that slowly deforms anyone within a meter of it, having been seen to cause growth of additional limbs, facial features, amd tentacles. Transferred via two-meter long tongs to incinerator.

//Note: The Thousand Sons are dedicated to Tzeentch, Chaos God of change, psykers, and mutation. - JR Elwin//

**Input:** One marine painted in Alpha Legion colors
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A cognitohazard that causes anyone who views it to believe themselves to be Alpharius, --which they are--. Incinerated.

//Note: And// that //is why nobody&#39;s put 40K into this thing all these years. For still more reference, the Alpha Legion is known for subterfuge, part of which includes nobody really knowing who&#39;s in charge. Thus, everyone claims to be Alpharius, their primarch. - JR Alpharius//

**Extraneous notes will not save a reference-heavy test; Even with all these notes, it is hard to get the &#34;joke&#34; or the reference to someone who has not read Warhammer 40K or versed themselves in the lore. - Szymons**
----

**Name:** Guest Researcher Stark Tuner
**Date:** 15/05/2022
**Total Items:** A collection of schnurples, glogons, zymbimbars and blungles; all orangantized for ease of testing.

//Note: I was surprised to see nobody had thought to test one of these, so I am visiting Facility-23 to perform some experiments of my own. I hope you all don&#39;t mind. - Rsr. Stark Tuner//

**Input:** Five schnurples, all vaccinated
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** Nineteen schnipping nuggets in a wet and gnoist state. No presence of urples were detected. It is presumed SCP-914 had accidently absorbed them while in the &#34;refining&#34; process.

//Note: I can smell the urples in one of the booths. The scent is demoralizing. I recommend the covering of banana paste in all corners of this testing room before we get any more problems. I brought some for emergencies. - Rsr. Stark Tuner//

**Input:** Forty-six glogons, seven schnurples and minus one blungles. All were kissed before input.
**Setting:** Course
**Output:** A mass of glongarified trungkable wowons, with a spoon of bungle bunnies on the side. Presence of urples were briefly detected, but they zorged out before analysis.

//Note: Review of test video recordings revealed that SCP-914 appears to be crying. - Rsr. Stark Tuner//

**Input:** A zymbibar, eight-thousand-two-hundred-and-sixty-five Quonklerjangles (unclean), thirty-five zymbibars, twenty-eight jars of prew, no zymbibars, the essophysical embodiment of a gerald and an unknown amount/density of zymbibars.
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:**  A wooden chair.

**Input:** One bungle, deminyfied.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Unknown, SCP-914 refuses to show the output to personnel. It excretes excessive amounts of urple in its mechanisms. An apology is currently being planned.

//Note: Aha! Now things are starting to make sense here. All I have to do is the last test. - Rsr. Stark Tuner//

[Final test omitted due to the predictable results of &#34;Very Fine&#34; outputted objects.]

//Note: This was a very great learning experience. I thank the Facility-23 staff for all of their help. I&#39;ll be leaving the rest of zymbibars in here for good luck, just make sure to not think about them at all times. Goodbye everyone! - Rsr. Stark Tuner//

**Notice from Dr. Arthur Hackett, Facility-23 Administration:** All staff are to currently disregard the previous tests, as they have been determined to be false. No concrete evidence of such tests being performed on this date was found. Investigations into the manifestation of this text in the SCP-914 Experiment Log are currently being made. Updates will be announced as soon as possible.

Futhermore, Research Cell 109-B is temporarily closed until the chamber is sufficiently cleaned.

**Name:** Dr. Fleischer
**Date:** 15/05/2022
**Total Items:** Five copies of the indie-horror video game &#34;Bendy and The Ink Machine&#34;
 
**Input:** One copy of the game &#34;Bendy and The Ink Machine&#34;
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** A pile of polycarbonate plastic blocks, a small block of wood, and a puddle of ink.

**Input:** One copy of the game &#34;Bendy and The Ink Machine&#34;
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** A blank disc, an unlabeled game case, and a blank sheet of plastic.

**Input:** One copy of the game &#34;Bendy and The Ink Machine&#34;
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One copy of the game &#34;Poppy Playtime&#34;

**Input:** One copy of &#34;Bendy and The Ink Machine&#34;
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A DVD case labelled as &#34;Best of Bendy and Friends!&#34; DVD inside was a collection of classic cartoon shorts starring the titular cartoon character. None of the cartoons shown are known to exist.

**Input:** One copy of the game &#34;Bendy and The Ink Machine&#34;
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** An unlabeled game disc and case.

//Note: D-Class subject who played the result of the &#34;very fine&#34; test appeared to lose color in their skin and hair, and their eyes appeared to be entirely black. Effects are permanent, but do not seem to effect long term health. Subjects effected also seem to have a minor increase in tolerance for damage. - Dr. Fleischer//

------

**Name:** Intern Beauvillier
**Date:** 17/05/2022
**Total Items:** Three desk lamps

**Input:** One desk lamp
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One desk heater. Inner circuits have been redirected to produce maximal heat output while conserving the same power input as inputted lamp. However, testing has shown it is completely unpractical, as the heat output is so high that every standard issue ink evaporates after a few minutes of exposure.

//Note: I could escape from paperwork with this—I mean, incinerated. This is useless. - Intern Beauvillier//

**Input:** One desk lamp
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A 99% efficient lamp. The filament appears to have been anomalously modified to reduce heat emissions to a minimum and maximize light output. However, disassembly of the light bulb to study the filament appears to have permanently neutralized its anomalous capabilities.

**Input:** One desk lamp
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A visibly unchanged desk lamp. However, turning it on drastically affects light conditions in the space it is turned on in. When turned on, it appears as if every object in the room is shined on from every angle, rendering a perfectly uniform lighting. Due to these conditions, it is impossible for the brain to correctly process distances.

**Addendum:** Output spontaneously neutralized during testing, as in a hasty attempt to switch it off, Intern Beauvillier collided with the table on which it was positioned and displaced it in such a manner that its light source was terminated on impact with the floor.

------

**Name:** Junior Researcher Mizuki
**Date:** 17/05/2022
**Items:** Two current flags of Phoenix, two flags of Phoenix (adopted from 1921 to 1990)

**Input:** A flag of Phoenix (1921-1990 iteration)
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A flag of San Francisco

//Note: I blame the equally bad designs of these two flags. - J.R. Mizuki//

**Input:** A flag of Phoenix (current iteration)
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A flag of Wichita, Kansas

**Input:** A flag of Phoenix (1921-1990 iteration)
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** A flag of Milwaukee

//Note: This kind of makes sense. Coarse makes it worse in a way, and Milwaukee&#39;s flag embodies that. - J.R. Mizuki//

**Input:** A flag of Phoenix (current iteration)
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A flag of Phoenix, but the seal is replaced by that of the Phoenix Force logo from Marvel Comics. Upon retrieval, the output attempted to strangle Junior Researcher Mizuki but failed. Two attempts to neutralize the output via incineration resulted in the flag spontaneously regenerating five meters away, with a more refined logo and further attempts to strangle other researchers. Output eventually neutralized via liquid nitrogen and its remains are placed in storage.
