It was ironic, in a way. In a CK-event or NK-event extinction scenario, all SCPs that could be terminated were to be terminated, so that whatever shreds remained of humanity could have at least a glimmer of chance of surviving in the ruined world. 

In a XK-event, all SCPs were set free, so that they might carry humanity&#39;s last seeds to whatever wonderlands they would flee to.

A suitcase slammed on the floor next to SCP-073. &#34;Heads up, Cain. You are free, on one condition. Take the suitcase with you. When you see the sun again, open it.&#34;

Cain shook his head, sitting in lotus position, eyes still closed. He nodded towards the patterns drawn in blood, covering the walls of his room. &#34;I am sorry, but I shall be staying. Chances to die like this only come once... well, in a lifetime. I will not be left behind this time.&#34;

The researcher sat in front of him with a heavy sigh and lit a cigarette, his disability making it a long and elaborate procedure. &#34;Suit yourself. Damn, I should&#39;ve never taken up smoking.&#34;

&#34;Losing hope? I guess I should commend you for keeping it this long.&#34;

&#34;Fuck you.&#34; 

Cain frowned. &#34;I mean it. For what it&#39;s worth, I am honestly sorry for what is happening.&#34;

&#34;What, you telling me the apocalypse is your doing?&#34;

&#34;Not quite, but I&#39;ve dealt with it before. And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found, and the third part of the creatures that had life died.&#34; Cain vaguely gestured with his metal arms.

&#34;So we&#39;re fucking biblical now and you&#39;re the Cain that killed his brother?&#34; The researcher chuckled. &#34;I don&#39;t think that took.&#34; 

&#34;No, I am not. At least, not quite.&#34;  A weary laugh. &#34;Very well. I swore to take this secret to the grave, but there are more than enough graves now. The job your Foundation does - that it did until now? I have done something similar in the past.&#34; 

&#34;The past. How far past we are talking about? Before the Beatles?&#34;

&#34;Before music. We had a good group, back then. Yweh, me, Hevel, Lilit, Bright - not your Bright, I&#39;m afraid - Orion, Sela... More, much more, but the others are gone. Even their names, when we failed.&#34;

&#34;And you guys just lived for the next n-th millenia and waited for someone to invent television?&#34;

&#34;Only the cursed. Only us that went too far and too deep, and were branded for it. No, I didn&#39;t kill Able. But I might as well have.&#34;

The researcher sneered, lighting a second cigarette. &#34;Could have shared a bit more with us before this sort of schedule pressure, chief.&#34;

&#34;One copy of the &#39;Containment Procedures&#39; in every hotel of America is not enough?&#34; 

&#34;Something may have been lost in the translation.&#34;

Cain sighed. &#34;Ten millenia is a long time, child. Even ideas decay. No, you have done a much better job than we have. You have even managed to keep that accursed lizard caged for more than a week.&#34;

&#34;Not good enough.&#34;

&#34;It is not the end, you know. It was not the end before.&#34; He touched his brand. &#34;And the storm will face more than seven thirds, this time.&#34; 

&#34;I&#39;d really prefer to see for myself.&#34;

Cain opened his eyes. &#34;Would you? Would you be cursed? Would you have life itself flee you at every step?&#34; 

The researcher leaned up, inches away from Cain&#39;s face. &#34;If it saves one life. If it lets one more human be born.&#34;

SCP-073 paused for a moment, then laughed. &#34;Yes. That is what I said, then.&#34; He stood up. &#34;Shall we, Dr. Kain?&#34; 

The dog got up and spat his cigarette. &#34;After you... Senior Researcher Cain.&#34;</textarea></pre>
