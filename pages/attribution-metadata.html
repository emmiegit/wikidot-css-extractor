+++ Introduction

Greetings. Welcome to the Attribution Metadata page. This page is used to store user attributions in cases where they could not be stored natively by the site&#39;s software platform, or to override them if they were stored incorrectly. This includes information about authors, coauthors, rewrites, translations, and other similar things.

Please note that this page is only used to attribute original site content to past and present members of the site. Attributions for off-site materials or to individuals unaffiliated with the site, such as image attributions, are kept elsewhere

+++ Usage guidelines

This page and its children are locked to edits. Please notify a staff member if you would like an entry added.

Due to the volume of edits on this page, please remember to leave a change description before saving! This should be a simple description of the changes you have made.

If you think that information about a page created by another person is incorrect, please contact a staff member.

This page is split into four fragments. Add entries to the appropriate fragment, in alphabetical order:

* [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/attribution:mainlist Mainlist SCP articles].
* [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/attribution:other-scp Other SCP articles]. This includes 001 proposals, -Js, -EX, -INT, etc.
* [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/attribution:misc All other _default pages]. This includes tales, hubs, essays, etc. Anything that is not in a specific category.
* [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/attribution:categories Special page categories]. This includes any non-default page, such as {{theme:}}s or {{component:}}s. {{fragment:}} pages should __not__ be added.

----

* The &#34;name&#34; column must match the page&#39;s slug. This includes everything after the last dash (&#34;/&#34;) character. Where applicable, the category must be included as well. Note that the title of the page can be different from its name.
* At present, only the following values are accepted in the &#34;type&#34; column:
 * **author** - to override the original creator of the page, or to indicate multiple co-authors.
 * **rewrite** -for major rewrites of the page. Specifying the date is advised to avoid disambiguations.
 * **translator** - for pages originally written on one of the translation off-shots.
* The &#34;date&#34; column denotes when this particular user became associated with the page. For authors, this is identical to the page&#39;s creation date and may be omitted. For rewrites that are edits of an older page, this is the date the edit was made. For rewrites that posted a new page, this is the date the original page was posted. For translators, this is the date on which the translation was posted. _
 _
The value of the &#34;date&#34; column must follow the &#34;YYYY-MM-DD&#34; pattern - 4-digit year, followed by 2-digit month, and 2-digit date. In cases were the value is in single digits, it must be zero-filled, e.g. 2016-01-05 for January 5, 2016.
* Empty fields must contain at least one space (&#34; &#34;) character in order to display correctly. In general, only the date field should ever be empty.

After editing the page, look at the end result and make sure that the table is displayed correctly - no rows are missing, no gaps or broken cells are present.
