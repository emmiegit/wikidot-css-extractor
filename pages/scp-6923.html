**Special Containment Procedures:** As of 23-09-2011, primary containment of SCP-6923 has been deemed impossible. As a result, containment procedures will primarily focus on information management. Any reports of conception in absence of suitable sexual partners by women in the areas surrounding known SCP-6923 habitats are to be investigated and the affected subjects are to be brought into custody. Local media publications are to be provided disinformation campaigns or administered Class-A amnestics. Historical documents and contemporary journalism related to reports of adolescent male suicides in the area are to be confiscated and expunged from public records, and Class-A amnestics administered. Scientific surveys of known SCP-6923 habitats must be diverted or suspended, and any publicly available information resulting from biological surveys is to be expunged and all documents confiscated. 

A team of specialists will be assigned to monitor SCP-6923 migration and reproductive patterns, and public advisories for toxic algal blooms are to be posted in areas experiencing breeding events.

SCP-6923-A instances in custody are allocated standard humanoid containment cells and are to be monitored by Foundation pediatricians at all times. Use of tranquilizing agents is authorized should an SCP-6923-A instance exhibit violent behavior during or after a Metamorphosis Event.

Following review by the Ethics Committee, a large residential development has been approved and constructed for long-term containment of those affected by SCP-6923 reproduction. In addition, a program has been established for those in custody to opt into selective amnesticization and be released to the general public, should no further anomalous properties be detected.


**Description:** SCP-6923 is the designation for an anomalous species of aquatic, pseudo-cnidarian animals in the genus //Homo//[[footnote]] Genetic and Mitochondrial DNA testing indicate an extremely close relationship to humans. [[/footnote]], that inhabit the waters of Lakes Michigan, Superior, Ontario, and associated tributaries. SCP-6923 are highly derived in physiology, possessing a body structure superficially resembling members of the order //Stauromedusae//[[footnote]] Colloquially referred to as the Stalked Jellyfish. [[/footnote]]. The life cycle of SCP-6923 is complex, cyclically alternating between a sessile polyp stage and a free-swimming medusa stage, typically seen during breeding events. 

SCP-6923 reproduce by ejaculating long-lived free-swimming sperm cells into the surrounding waters, which will then travel long distances[[footnote]] SCP-6923 has been known to successfully fertilize subjects as far as 3 miles from the fathering SCP-6923 shoal. [[/footnote]] until finding a suitable human female. Upon successful fertilization, the affected human female will undergo a typical non-anomalous human pregnancy, with the resulting hybridized fetus biologically indistinguishable from a human. The resulting offspring, henceforth designated SCP-6923-A, will typically be born healthy and have no functional differences from a non-anomalous human infant.

Male instances of SCP-6923-A will undergo a Metamorphosis Event upon the onset of puberty. Instances will experience a strong, compelling psychological urge to submerge in nearby bodies of water, increased aggression, hyperhidrosis, and socially isolating tendencies.

After a variable amount of time, typically between one to six months after onset of puberty, SCP-6923-A instances will completely submerge in a body of water and begin to experience radial fissuring of the flesh starting at the oral cavity and eventually splitting along the abdomen to the groin. The resulting six segmented portions will undergo rapid anatomical reorganization, including the de-centralization of brain tissue and reapportionment throughout the SCP-6923-A&#39;s instance&#39;s body. The central tissue opening will then form a new oral cavity and surrounding tentacles, after which the SCP-6923-A instance will have completed the Metamorphosis Event into an adult SCP-6923 instance.

Female SCP-6923-A do not undergo Metamorphosis Events, and will remain biologically indistinguishable from non-anomalous humans until death. Human-fathered offspring of female SCP-6923-A instances do not display any anomalous properties.

**Discovery:** Initial discovery was the result of field agents responding to local reports of &#34;Freshwater Jellyfish&#34; in several small towns along the northeastern coast of Lake Michigan. Personnel arriving in the area were able to document several instances of SCP-6923, and subsequent impromptu examination revealed their anomalous biology. Efforts to contain known populations and investigate the local residents&#39; knowledge of the instances yielded additional discoveries, including the reproductive behavior of SCP-6923, as well as an extensive local mythology and folkloric tradition involving SCP-6923 in the surrounding rural communities.

SCP-6923 are believed to have inhabited the waters of Lake Michigan for at least 300 years, with colonization of the Lake Superior and Lake Ontario wetlands occurring in the mid-1800s. Historical evidence of SCP-6923 has been found in obscure newspaper and tabloid clippings from 19th century Great Lakes settlement archives, as well as rural urban legends and folklore. Findings from analysis of local archives indicated a correlation between SCP-6923&#39;s reproductive behavior and local statistically significant disappearances and reports of adolescent males committing suicide via drowning.

**Foreword:** Interview conducted during the post-discovery investigation of SCP-6923. Subject is Jennifer Mayr, a resident of ██████, Wisconsin pregnant with an instance of SCP-6923-A. Interview conducted by Agent Aubrey Pearsson.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Pearsson:** Hey, good afternoon. I&#39;m with some of the authorities around here. Is it alright if I ask you some questions?

**Mayr:** Fine by me, ain&#39;t got nothing better to do.

**Pearsson:** So, I&#39;d like to start by asking you if you&#39;ve noticed any of these disappearances yourself. Have you seen anything?

**Mayr:** Everyone round these parts knows someone whose kid went missing these days. Yeah, I&#39;ve seen them. 

**Pearsson:** Can you tell me about that?

**Mayr:** I guess. Y&#39;know, strange shit happens all the time. The Dawsons&#39; boy disappeared bout a year ago, ran off into the Lake. Heard stories for years about it happening. I grew up with a boy I had a little bit of a young crush on, he made for the lake too.

**Pearsson:** So there&#39;s a community knowledge about these events?

**Mayr:** It&#39;s something of an open secret. You can find a lot of other small towns where they know about these boys running off too. Not everyone knows why they run off, but we do here. You can see me, right?

**Pearsson:** When&#39;s the due date?

**Mayr:** Lord if I know. I haven&#39;t been to a doctor to have it checked out &#39;cos I know what they&#39;ll say. I know I&#39;m pregnant, but I ain&#39;t dumb, and I ain&#39;t a hoe, either, despite what some other folks might think who don&#39;t know anything about nothing. But I am careless, and I know all the stories my momma told me growing up about knowing what times of the year &#39;an month to go swimming. And I messed up big time.

**Pearsson:** There&#39;s no father in the picture, I take it? I noticed you don&#39;t wear a ring, and there&#39;s no indication you live with anyone else.

//Mayr laughs//

**Mayr:** Yeah, there isn&#39;t a baby daddy anywhere to be seen. I&#39;ll tell you what, do you believe in myths? Supernatural shit?

//Pearsson remains silent//

**Mayr:** You probably do, if you lot are finally taking a look at what goes down here. My baby daddy is good &#39;ol Lake Michigan. My momma told me, don&#39;t go swimming in there at the wrong time of the year, you&#39;re gonna get yourself knocked up. Knew so many folks, girls my age and younger who got messed up. I dunno why it happens, but it happens. Happened to my momma, and that&#39;s how I&#39;m here. You got kids?

**Pearsson:** No, I don&#39;t. I&#39;ve never been able to settle down, been putting my career first since I was a young woman straight out of college.

**Mayr:** Ah, gosh, well, you looked the type.

**Pearsson:** My mom had me young too. Never knew my dad, don&#39;t think she knew him either. But she still did a good job raising me.

**Mayr:** You&#39;re one of the lucky ones. With a ma that didn&#39;t crumble. Lord would think we&#39;d get tougher after it&#39;s gone on so long. But I think pain just passes down from my momma&#39;s ma, to her, down to me, forever. Like a curse that just goes on.

**Pearsson:** So, this has been something that&#39;s happened to women for generations, then? Since you mentioned your mother told you stories and-

**Mayr:** Yeah, probably. &#39;S something we just gotta deal with. My momma got knocked up by the lake too.

**Pearsson:** But you didn&#39;t end up drowning yourself, or disappearing. It&#39;s just the boys.

**Mayr:** Ain&#39;t you the one supposed to be asking questions?

**Pearsson:** I&#39;m just checking my info, alright? Um. Okay, is there a reason y&#39;all keep the babies?

**Mayr:** Now what the hell are you trying to say?

**Pearsson:** I was just sugg-

**Mayr:** We don&#39;t kill fucking babies here, I sure don&#39;t. I know some folks do that, but not here. 

**Pearsson:** So it&#39;s worth dealing with then? Because it seems to me like a lot of the pain associated with these incidents could be avoided fairly easily.

**Mayr:** You know what, fuck you. We&#39;ve got our faith, and so what if I get dealt shit hands like this. I&#39;m twenty-two, but goddammit if I&#39;m gonna do my best for this baby. Mary dealt with shit like this too. We deal with it. My baby won&#39;t have a daddy, but I didn&#39;t either. I turned out fine.

**Pearsson:** Listen, miss, we&#39;re trying to help put a stop to all this, find out what&#39;s going on. I didn&#39;t mean any offense.

**Mayr:** Why don&#39;t you go figure this shit out instead of questioning how I, how we live our lives? Nobody asks to deal with this, I didn&#39;t. I just wanted to go out and enjoy what&#39;s out there, and now I&#39;m stuck with the same thing that made my momma turn to the bottle. Get lost.

All known individuals pregnant with SCP-6923-A instances have been brought into custody. In addition, a surveillance program has been established to perform routine check-ins with any individuals currently raising suspected SCP-6923-A instances. (See Interview-6923-39 and Interview-6923-A-1)


[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Foreword:** Interview conducted with Georgina Lincoln by Agent Aubrey Pearsson. Subject is the mother of a 11 year old SCP-6923-A instance.

**Pearsson:** Good evening Miss Lincoln.

**Lincoln:** Evening.

**Pearsson:** You mind if I ask a few questions?

**Lincoln:** Don&#39;t know if I have much of a choice. That&#39;s why I&#39;m here.

**Pearsson:** Well, you don&#39;t have to answer my questions, but it definitely makes my job a lot easier. My life too.

**Lincoln:** Couldn&#39;t be that hard to begin with. Whatever, I&#39;ll talk. I don&#39;t have much else better to do other than talk to you folks or deal with my kid.

**Pearsson:** I know you&#39;ve avoided it in the past, but it would really help if you could tell me a little about your pregnancy.

**Lincoln:** I don&#39;t wanna talk about that. You know damn well.

**Pearsson:** I know it&#39;s probably a difficult topic, I know. Trust me, I know. But it&#39;s important to us to know everything. Especially to try and provide the best level of care for your son.

**Lincoln:** You don&#39;t know anything! I don&#39;t want to think about that shit when I&#39;ve tried so hard to move past it and raise that damn boy well. You say you&#39;re helping but y&#39;all haven&#39;t done shit to stop anything so far. Word travels.

**Pearsson:** I&#39;m going to be real with you, Georgina, we more or less already know what happened to you. We can look through records. But we don&#39;t have your perspective. I know how men up high can leave out important details. And we&#39;re trying to figure stuff out to help prevent kids like your son from getting messed up by this condition. It&#39;ll benefit him.

//Lincoln is visibly agitated.//

**Lincoln:** I don&#39;t give a damn about how it&#39;ll benefit him! He deserves a mom who actually wanted him. Who wanted to be a parent. God fucking damnit. I don&#39;t need a stupid agency tryna parent him. I was a kid. Eighteen years old. First in my family to graduate high school, let alone go to college. Summer vacation, before I was gonna go to Boston. Took a trip to this bougie little resort they had out of Marquette. Jesus.

//Lincoln pauses.//

**Lincoln:** I never went to college &#39;cos I ended up pregnant. Course you know that already. Family kicked me out &#39;cos I didn&#39;t have a boyfriend. I never dated because I focused on school. Making it out. How I end up pregnant without a boyfriend? You never should see the way a father looks at his whore daughter. I didn&#39;t even do it but it still hurts. I never even thought twice about it too, just thought I didn&#39;t remember it happening. 

**Pearsson:** I&#39;m really sorry to hear that. I know it&#39;s awful. We&#39;ve been trying to find a solution to this problem. But it&#39;s difficult, and we rely on folks like you who have been affected to get information.

**Lincoln:** Difficult is an understatement. I spent a solid seven years on the street trying to scrounge up half a life for me and Jayvon, but no dice. I wasn&#39;t no more than a fuck up of a mom. Then you folks came about and found us, I don&#39;t even know how, a few weeks after I broke down, and burnt some spare change I got from dancing on a DNA test for my kid. 

**Pearsson:** Right, we brought you both into custody after we found out your son was one affected.

**Lincoln:** I swear I felt like I was in a fever dream when y&#39;all told me the truth. My baby is the son of some sea monster? Fuck that.

**Pearsson:** I understand how you feel. Trust me, I&#39;ve been working for a bit, and sometimes I still come across stuff that is impossible to believe. It&#39;s a brutal world out there, Miss Lincoln. I&#39;m sorry that you&#39;ve had a hard life. We&#39;ve made it a point to try and provide good living arrangements for the women affected.

**Lincoln:** Hard doesn&#39;t cover half of it lady.

//Lincoln pauses.//

**Lincoln:** Do you know how hard it is to try and love your kid when you look at him and just see the thing that ruined your life?

**Pearsson:** You can&#39;t mean that. I mean, you&#39;re allowed to feel that way. But you&#39;ve done a great job so far, he&#39;s a good kid. But, I mean...

**Lincoln:** Sometimes I feel like shit that I feel this way. But fuck. I was so close to having the good life. I try so damn hard but I still have days where I can&#39;t stand to look at him. It makes my skin crawl. But I gotta hide it for him.

**Pearsson:** I think, for now, we can take a break from interviewing. I appreciate your time, miss. I really do. Is it alright if I speak with Jayvon too?

**Lincoln:** Go ahead. I used up enough of your time on shit that don&#39;t matter anyway. He&#39;s outside anyways. I send him out when y&#39;all visit so he doesn&#39;t hear shit he shouldn&#39;t.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Foreword:** Interview conducted shortly after Interview-6923-39. Subject is SCP-6923-A instance Jayvon Lincoln.

**Pearsson:** Hey, Jayvon, I&#39;m Aubrey, I&#39;m have a little chat with you, is that alright? I already spoke with your mom.

**SCP-6923-A:** Yeah. Am I in trouble?

**Pearsson:** No, of course not. I just wanna ask you some stuff about you. Do you like living here?

**SCP-6923-A:** It&#39;s way better than where we were living before. No creepy dudes here. Water is really clean too.

**Pearsson:** We try to keep everything nice for you all. Have any friends?

**SCP-6923-A:** I have a few. We shoot hoops and sh- stuff, and talk. There&#39;s a lot of boys but I don&#39;t get right with them much. Me and Darius and Jake and Pablo are the only ones who seem be about it.

**Pearsson:** What do you mean by that.

**SCP-6923-A:** They shy. And don&#39;t like the same stuff as us. Man, I don&#39;t know. But I like my friends. They&#39;re cool.

**Pearsson:** It took me a little while to make friends when I was a kid, I get you. It&#39;s good that you have a few already. No girls?

**SCP-6923-A:** The girls are alright. They get annoying though. They like different stuff and when I talk to them I feel like I&#39;m too different.

**Pearsson:** I&#39;m a girl, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m that different.

**SCP-6923-A:** I guess not. Maybe when I&#39;m older I&#39;ll get to be friends with pretty girls like you.

**Pearsson:** Right. Well, could you tell me anything about where you lived before?

**SCP-6923-A:** We hopped around a lot. I think since I was even littler. But I never stayed at a school for a long time, so I never had no friends. At least I have some here. It&#39;s good here.

**Pearsson:** How come you moved so much?

**SCP-6923-A:** Momma&#39;s always looking for work. She got a ton of different jobs. Worked at tons of different hours. I liked when we she was making a lot of money, and we got the van, and that was really nice. Not having to share a room with weirdos. We lived in a lot of old dusty houses too. Momma said they were cheap to live in. But we didn&#39;t have a lot of stuff, so it was just mattresses.

**Pearsson:** Was it ever scary? I mean it sounds like a lot for a kid.

**SCP-6923-A:** Sometimes, but most of the time it was fun. Ma is a fun mom. She can be scary sometimes, but I think it&#39;s cos I&#39;m such a troublemaker.

**Pearsson:** I don&#39;t think you&#39;re too much of a bad kid. Even though we all know it was you who wrote all over the Jeffries&#39; door.

**SCP-6923-A:** I didn&#39;t do that!

**Pearsson:** You&#39;re right, I was testing you. It was a test, and you passed. Speaking of tests, do you like your classes? Like school?

**SCP-6923-A:** Not really. I don&#39;t do well with the books. I like sports more.

**Pearsson:** Is that why you and your friends play basketball so often?

**SCP-6923-A:** Yeah, man. I wanna be in the NBA when I&#39;m grown. They&#39;re too cool. They look awesome, they get surrounded by pretty ladies all the time, and they make so much money that they can pay their momma&#39;s momma&#39;s momma&#39;s bills. I can&#39;t wait until I&#39;m like that.

**Pearsson:** You sound like you have an idea of your future.

**SCP-6923-A:** I know my mom would be proud of me if I got famous like that. 

**Pearsson:** I&#39;m sure she&#39;s already proud of you now.

**SCP-6923-A:** You think so? 

**Pearsson:** I know so.

**Addendum-1:** 


[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Foreword:** Interview conducted with Jennifer Mayr by Junior Researcher Moira Grant. Subject is the mother of two twin SCP-6923-A instances.

**Grant:** Hey, Miss Mayr, How are you doing today? I&#39;m Moira, Moira Grant. I&#39;m gonna be handling your check ups from now on.

**Mayr:** I&#39;m doing alright, I guess. 

**Grant:** Good to hear! Great to hear, uh, well, I guess I&#39;ll start by asking, how have you and the boys been doing as of late?

**Mayr:** Lord, they&#39;re a handful. We do alright, but it&#39;s a lot of work, keeping them out of trouble.

**Grant:** I can imagine! They&#39;re, what, eleven now?

**Mayr:** Twelve. They just turned twelve. Lord how the time passes by. 

**Grant:** You&#39;re telling me! My mind slipped, my son just turned eleven a few months ago.

**Mayr:** It&#39;s weird, ain&#39;t it?

**Grant:** Seeing them grow up really is something. But, anyways, I do have some questions to ask, as much as I&#39;d love to chat.

**Mayr:** &#39;S funny, you&#39;re the first to see me that actually has a kid.

**Grant:** Ah, yeah. Our line of work doesn&#39;t lend itself to starting a family. But anyways, I&#39;m gonna do a quick little check up on your mental state. Ready?

**Mayr:** As ever for them same dumb questions.

**Grant:** Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or others recently?

**Mayr:** Never, unless you count wringing in Christopher&#39;s neck for picking fights.

//Grant laughs.//

**Grant:** For the sake of this, no that doesn&#39;t count. Have you felt like you would be better off dead? Recently?

**Mayr:** Nope.

**Grant:**  Any racing thoughts or trouble sleeping?

**Mayr:** Yeah.

**Grant:** Can you elaborate on that?

**Mayr:** I know you know I know more about my boys than most of the other mothers in here.

**Grant:** What do you mean by that?

**Mayr:** I know what happens to sons of the lake. I seen it too. My ma taught me. Shit, racing thoughts? Since Chris and James turned twelve, I stay up at night wondering. Real nervous. 

**Grant:** Well...

**Mayr:** Chris is starting his girl crazy stage too.

**Grant:** Oh, god, that must be a trip!

**Mayr:** Yeah, gosh, I remember when I was a girl, my childhood friend Dave, well he went into that stage. Damn near peeked and lifted my skirt whenever he could. Ma would tell me not to let him do it. I thought it was hilarious! I was a kid. But the boys they all get through that weird little time when they start noticing, I mean really noticing, those schoolgirls they go to school with.

**Grant:** I don&#39;t know, Jennifer. My son&#39;s never done that. I don&#39;t think he would ever think of it. I&#39;ve been teaching him everything when it comes to manners. 

**Mayr:** Well, Rick was from a church family too. I don&#39;t imagine it&#39;s got anything to do with it. I knew from the moment I gave birth that my sons were gonna grow into. Even if I tell them, kids are monkeys, monkeys see what monkeys do.

**Grant:** I guess. But the condition that changes them, it can eventually be cured. We&#39;re working diligently on that.

**Mayr:** Oh I have faith everything will work out. I know it will. If not by your pills, then by my strength and God&#39;s grace. My boys will turn out fine.

**Foreword:** Interview conducted by Agent Aubrey Pearsson. Subject is SCP-6923-A instance Jayvon Lincoln, 12 years old. Interview conducted following an altercation between subject and his mother.

**Pearsson:** Hey, Jayvon, you holding up okay?

**SCP-6923-A:** I don&#39;t wanna talk to you! Go away!

**Pearsson:** I know a lot happened, but I promise I&#39;m just trying to help.

**SCP-6923-A:** Did momma send you?

**Pearsson:** No, no, I&#39;m just here to talk to you. See how you&#39;re feeling. Are you hurt?

**SCP-6923-A:** I don&#39;t wanna talk to you.

**Pearsson:** Look, I promise I&#39;m not gonna punish you. But I have to check in on you. Make sure you&#39;re doing okay after that. Ok?

//SCP-6923-A does not respond.//

**Pearsson:** Are you hurt?

**SCP-6923-A:** My arm is a little sore.

**Pearsson:** We can get you an ice pack. Can you tell me what happened?

**SCP-6923-A:** Do I have to talk about it?

**Pearsson:** Well, no, you don&#39;t, technically. But I&#39;m here to try and hear it from you. Get your side of the story.

**SCP-6923-A:** I already know momma blabbed &#39;bout everything already. All she does. Why do you care?

**Pearsson:** You know your mother is very sad about what happened.

**SCP-6923-A:** I know she is. I don&#39;t know why.

**Pearsson:** Why don&#39;t you tell me what happened and maybe we can figure it out?

**SCP-6923-A:** I was outside playing with my friends. We was shooting hoops like we always do. Momma came outside told me to come inside. She needed to talk to me. I was upset &#39;cos I wanted to stay outside and play. And then she was yelling to me all mad and stuff &#39;cos I wasn&#39;t doing this or doing that, and she was so mad. I wanted to just be out there playing with my friends. I started yelling at her about how it wasn&#39;t fair.

**Pearsson:** You felt like it wasn&#39;t fair for her to get on you about the chores like that?

**SCP-6923-A:** I guess. Yeah. I wanted to play with my friends for longer. She got even more madder when I yelled about it, she said &#34;Jayvon, life ain&#39;t fair, go clean that damn room &#39;fore I drag you there myself!&#34; I didn&#39;t say nothing back, I just tried to push her aside and go back outside and then she slammed me into the ground when I touched her like that.

**Pearsson:** Uhm.

**SCP-6923-A:** My momma never hit me like that before. She was staring at me when I was on the floor hurting. She was looking at me like she was scared of me. Then she ran up the stairs into her room.

**Pearsson:** She didn&#39;t say anything else?

//SCP-6923-A shakes his head.//

**SCP-6923-A:** I went to my room when I felt a little better and locked the door. After a while momma came outside my room and knocked on the door, I heard her say &#34;Momma&#39;s sorry baby.&#34; a few times but I told her to go away. Then she stopped. And then you came here.

**Pearsson:** How do you feel about the whole thing? Are you upset still?

**SCP-6923-A:** I don&#39;t get my ma. Sometimes she&#39;s the best person in the whole world. But then sometimes she&#39;s just angry all the time. I feel like I always do something to piss her off. My friends got me. I do better with them.

**Pearsson:** You know, they don&#39;t give mom&#39;s a textbook on how to be a mom when they have a kid.

**SCP-6923-A:** That&#39;s stupid.

**Pearsson:** Yeah, well. Life&#39;s stupid sometimes. But your mom&#39;s trying to make the best of it.

**SCP-6923-A:** But why is that my fault? Why&#39;m I the bad guy?

**Pearsson:** Oh, Jayvon, you&#39;re not the bad guy. No one is.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Addendum-2:** Thus far, ███ instances of SCP-6923-A have undergone Metamorphosis Events. A specialized research team has been established to monitor behavioral and psychological changes in SCP-6923-A instances. (See Interview-6923-A-2)

Attempts to determine the degree of sentience possessed by SCP-6923 instances have been met with mixed results. Neurological imaging suggests complex brain activity is present in SCP-6923 instances, however, possibly due to physiological changes, coherent communication is not believed to be possible. Solitary SCP-6923 specimens display highly elevated stress levels compared to instances kept in groups.

**Foreword:** Interview conducted by Agent Aubrey Pearsson. Subject is SCP-6923-A instance Jayvon Lincoln, 13 years old.

**SCP-6923-A:** Man, don&#39;t they got any dudes I can talk to?

**Pearsson:** That&#39;s no way to greet me. Come on, dude. After so long.

**SCP-6923-A:** Whatever. I guess I gotta talk to you again, like I do every week. At least you&#39;re easy on the eyes.

**Pearsson:** How many times do I have to tell you you shouldn&#39;t make comments like that, Jayvon. I know your mother doesn&#39;t let that stuff fly either.

**SCP-6923-A:** Man, whatever. She goes on about stupid stuff all the time.

**Pearsson:** You&#39;ve been picking up a little bit of an attitude lately. What&#39;s going on? 

**SCP-6923-A:** You wouldn&#39;t get it.

**Pearsson:** I doubt that. I&#39;ve lived a lot longer than you have. And it&#39;s my job to find out anyways. So, what&#39;s with the foul behavior lately.

**SCP-6923-A:** I feel so cooped up here. 

**Pearsson:** Why do you say that? You seem to like living here-

**SCP-6923-A:** That&#39;s not what I mean. All this shit with my mom, man, I feel like I&#39;m being babied all the damn time. I wanna be a man. And my ma don&#39;t let me. She always treating me like I&#39;m a kid. I&#39;m not.

**Pearsson:** Well, you still are a kid.

**SCP-6923-A:** Whatever. I see some other kids doing shit with their dads like fixing cars or learning how to lift and shit. My mom doesn&#39;t do that. All she does is nag me. And look at me like I&#39;m a piece of garbage.

**Pearsson:** You don&#39;t mean that, that&#39;s... you know that isn&#39;t true, right? She loves you very much.

**SCP-6923-A:** Yeah, yeah. She say it, she does it too. Even when she be nagging me. But sometimes I can see her looking at me crazy. 

**Pearsson:** That doesn&#39;t mean she doesn&#39;t love you though, Jayvon. Sometimes I look at my son crazy when he does something crazy. Like say disrespectful comments.

**SCP-6923-A:** See? Man, I told you you wouldn&#39;t get it. I just wanna ball. I wanna be out there, doing my thing. I&#39;m good at playing. I don&#39;t wanna be around here held down and babied. You never understand how it feels to look up to those dudes.

**Pearsson:** I have dreams too. I had dreams, and I made them a thing. Having dreams is good, that&#39;s how I got through school, and now I&#39;m with my family and kids and husband. But your dreams don&#39;t mean you should put down everything your mother does for you.

**SCP-6923-A:** See that&#39;s the difference between y&#39;all and us. Y&#39;all dream of your family and husband and living in a nice house and that&#39;s it. It&#39;s boring. Me? I dream about playing ball, being big boss type shit. I wanna be like the dudes on TV.

**Pearsson:** It&#39;s fine to look at the TV, and dream about it, but that still doesn&#39;t mean you should ignore the real stuff. Like school. School is still important-

**SCP-6923-A:** Shit, you come here just to nag me too. I get bored.

**Pearsson:** It&#39;s my job. I know you don&#39;t wanna hear it, but be easy on your mom. She tries. And I try too. People do a lot for you. So try to be grateful.

**SCP-6923-A:** I&#39;ll be grateful when I&#39;m finally up there with the greats. Until then, this is all homework. You feel?

**Pearsson:** I guess. I think I&#39;m done here for today.

**SCP-6923-A:** &#39;Bout time.

**Foreword:** Interview conducted with Georgina Lincoln by Junior Researcher Moira Grant. Interview requested unexpectedly by subject.

//Lincoln is distressed, appearing to have been crying for a significant amount of time.//

**Lincoln:** Where&#39;s Aubrey? Aubrey Pearsson?

**Grant:** I&#39;m so sorry, Agent Pearsson was re-assigned to another case due to conflict of interest, following some recent, unexpected developments regarding her family. I&#39;m Moira Grant, I serve as part of the research team working on your son&#39;s condition.

**Lincoln:** Shit, okay. I was expecting her. I don&#39;t know you well. God I don&#39;t wanna have to talk about everything again.

**Grant:** I am familiar with your case, Miss Lincoln, I&#39;ve done panels on your son before. What&#39;s going on? Is everything alright.

**Lincoln:** I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t know.

**Grant:** We got word that you were requesting a check in immediately, so I was sent here as quickly as possible. Something is definitely wrong, I can tell you&#39;re not doing well. 

//Lincoln is silent.//

**Grant:** I&#39;m a mom too, you know.

**Lincoln:** Not the same kind that I am. I can tell by the way you talk, and speak. You love your kid, right?

**Grant:** Of course, I love them all more than anything else. Even more than my husband, though don&#39;t tell him that.

**Lincoln:** How many you got?

**Grant:** I have three. Oldest just graduated from high school, going to college. Adam. Then two daughters, in middle and elementary.

**Lincoln:** You got a son too.

**Grant:** Yeah, I do. He&#39;s turned out amazing.

//Lincoln begins crying again.//

**Grant:** Hey, hey, it&#39;s alright, it&#39;s alright.

**Lincoln:** Oh god, fuck, I just. I know I haven&#39;t been a great mom, but I just wanna see Jayvon like that. I wanna see him grow up. I know everything that&#39;s gonna happen to him. I know it all.

**Grant:** Hey, you&#39;ll get to see him. We&#39;ve been working hard to try and find something to help stop the condition, we&#39;re really close to getting something to work out. You&#39;re gonna be fine. Jayvon is gonna be fine.

**Lincoln:** You don&#39;t understand!

**Grant:** I don&#39;t understand, you&#39;re right, but I feel for you. I wouldn&#39;t be trying to help you out if I didn&#39;t. 

**Lincoln:** No, no, you don&#39;t get it. Jayvon was so happy, so proud, so excited to show me. He doesn&#39;t get what it means.

**Grant:** I don&#39;t-

**Lincoln:** He came and said: Momma guess what! and I said back, What honey? He said, I got my first hairs. I damn near burst out crying there, but I said to him, wow, baby you&#39;re gonna be a real man soon! He&#39;s so happy about it, he don&#39;t know. but I know what it means. I&#39;m gonna lose him.

**Grant:** It doesn&#39;t mean-

**Lincoln:** You can try to tell me, but I can tell by your face. I know I&#39;m gonna lose him soon. I know it. I hated him, but I love him. I don&#39;t care anymore about the past, I can&#39;t lose him. I don&#39;t want to lose him. My whole life I devoted to him. I tried so damn hard. Nothing I did was gonna change anything. He&#39;s gonna end up like that. God, I know it. Maybe I always knew it.

**Grant:** Listen, Miss Lincoln, there are some experimental procedures that might help delay it. 

**Lincoln:** I know it doesn&#39;t work. If it did, we wouldn&#39;t still be here. I want that pill Aubrey told me about. I don&#39;t wanna lose Jayvon. He&#39;s my baby. I don&#39;t wanna know that he&#39;s gonna end up like that. I don&#39;t wanna know he&#39;s gonna do that to someone else one day.

Research into further methods of delaying or mitigating a Metamorphosis Event in SCP-6923-A has thus far yielded no results.


[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Foreword:** Interview conducted with Jennifer Mayr by Junior Researcher Moira Grant. Subject has previously given birth to two twin instances of SCP-6923-A. Subject was a voluntary participant in prior experiments.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Grant:** Hey Jennifer, how&#39;re you doing today?

**Mayr:** Oh, I&#39;m doing alright! Another day on earth, so I&#39;m doing alright.

**Grant:** He&#39;s doing well?

**Mayr:** Oh gosh, yeah. He&#39;s so mellow, compared to the boys. Jeannie was easy too. I think age makes &#39;em more calmer and the like.

**Grant:** That&#39;s good to hear. You&#39;ve done plenty of these check-ins by now, so I&#39;m sure you know the drill.

**Mayr:** Yeah, I guess. I still wonder why you lot invest so much into this stuff. But I don&#39;t argue with the check.

**Grant:** Yeah, well. Anyways. You notice anything unusual since last check in? 

**Mayr:** Nope.

**Grant:** No difficulties or anything? 

**Mayr:** Other than his little hunger cries? No. Definitely not. I tell you, he&#39;s such an easy one.

**Grant:** That&#39;s always good to hear. Well I suppose we can do the mental health check up now. Alright.

//Shuffling papers can be heard.//

**Grant:** Have you had any recent thoughts of hurting yourself or others?

**Mayr:** Absolutely not.

**Grant:** Have you had any recent thoughts that you would be better off dead? Or that nobody would miss you?

**Mayr:** Well, doesn&#39;t everyone? I mean, I think those bad thoughts every now and then. But it&#39;s nothing serious. It&#39;s hard not to with how everything&#39;s been. You know, something I thank God that you lot ended up rounding us up, because I don&#39;t know if I ever could&#39;ve given a good enough life to Jeannie. The boys too, Christopher and James. They wouldn&#39;t have had anything of a good childhood in the short time they had without the living here.

**Grant:** That&#39;s a good outlook to have. Some women, you know, they wouldn&#39;t be so optimistic after losing their sons. I know we&#39;ve told you this before, but if you ever wanted to, we have stuff that could help you forget.

**Mayr:** I would never do that. They were still my sons, for those 13 years.

**Grant:** You wouldn&#39;t be a bad mother for wanting to forget. Plenty of others have opted in to amnesticization.

**Mayr:** It still hurts. My whole life hurts, really, but I know it all happens for a reason. It ain&#39;t like I never knew how tough this world is, since I was a girl. My mama, taught me how things were. Fucked up as she was. Elissa was too pretty a name for her.

**Grant:** I think in all this time I never heard you refer to your mother by name.

**Mayr:** I think of her as some woman, nowadays. The farther memories of living with her and her living get, the less she feels like mama, more I realize she was just a girl. A girl like me. Elissa Mayr! Named after her grandmother. Pretty name. She dealt with the same stuff I did. Lord didn&#39;t get her through it but he&#39;ll get me through it. Get Joseph through it too.

**Grant:** Joseph?

**Mayr:** My baby.

**Grant:** Oh god, you decided on a name! No one told me!

**Mayr:** Oh, don&#39;t stress too much. It took a while of mulling over. Going back and forth with myself. Least no man was there to argue with me.

//Grant laughs.//

**Grant:** True! That is very true. Me and my husband didn&#39;t decide on a name for our 2nd until the day after I gave birth!

**Mayr:** I could never put up with that. What did you lot decide on?

**Grant:** Ezekiel. Graduated this year.

**Mayr:** Good choice. Thought about that for Joseph. Wanted to go for a biblical name.

**Grant:** Any reason in particular?

**Mayr:** It&#39;s gonna sound silly to you, probably.

**Grant:** I promise I&#39;ve heard weirder. I can guarantee it.

**Mayr:** I got this feeling, really strong feeling. I can&#39;t shake it. I know something&#39;s different this time, Moira. He&#39;s gonna be different. He&#39;s gonna break this curse.

//Mayr shifts, looking downward toward the SCP-6923-A instance cradled on her lap.//

**Mayr:** Aren&#39;t you Joseph? Yeah, mama&#39;s got you. Mama says you&#39;re gonna turn out ok... Mama believes in you...
