**Item #:** SCP-5825

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5825 instances are to be interviewed and observed. Though many are cooperative, containment at this time is unfeasible, and as a result research into SCP-5825 instances and the phenomena that create them is to be prioritized.

**Description:** SCP-5825 is a class of humanoids that can transform and take on animal characteristics. These individuals are commonly known as &#34;shifters&#34; in this post-calamity world. Most shifters retain their human memories while in animal form, but otherwise behave like the animal they&#39;ve transformed into. SCP-5825 individuals must keep up with care and maintenance of all forms, human and otherwise, in order to survive.

It&#39;s believed that most SCP-5825 instances came before the calamity and survived it by shifting forms. However, none can recall the exact circumstances of the calamity.

**Addendum 5825-A:** Interview with an SCP-5825 instance

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Foreword:** Researcher Śląski convinced an SCP-5825 instance (hereafter SCP-5825-L) to answer a few questions for an interview in order to find out the nature of SCP-5825.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Śląski:** Thank you for agreeing to answer my questions.

**SCP-5825-L:** I mean, sure. It&#39;s completely pointless, I hope you know, but I&#39;ll try and tell you what I can.

**Śląski:** Right. Well, first things first, how long have you been a shifter?

**SCP-5825-L:** I mean, my whole life. I was born to two powerful shifters, and it seems as though their powers multiplied. Not to say I&#39;m the most powerful shifter out there but... I mean, I guess I&#39;m //one of// the most powerful shifters. But for the purposes of this, you should know that most shifters became shifters in their human lifetime. Arcane magic, or anomalous mishap or... something.

**Śląski:** You mean to say before--

**SCP-5825-L:** Yes, before the calamity, as I told you before Molly.

**Śląski:** Right. So then... are your normal human senses enhanced based on the forms you take?

**SCP-5825-L:** That would be a no. I act like a bat when in bat form, a mouse when in mouse form, you get the picture. But I can&#39;t echolocate as a human, and I can&#39;t see human colors as a mouse. The only thing that&#39;s retained is my memories and cognition, and even cognition can be a slippery slope.

**Śląski:** So if memories are retained, then--

**SCP-5825-L:** I already told you, I don&#39;t remember the calamity, just like you, and I can&#39;t tell you why I don&#39;t remember it, just like you. All I know is when I try to think back to then I get... sad and angry and very uncomfortable. //(She sighs.)// Look, I know you want to figure this out, but what&#39;s the point of doing that? Face it, humans are gone. They didn&#39;t survive the calamity. Not a one. Everything &#34;human&#34; that survived was corrupted, somehow. Less than. You&#39;ve met them, the shifters, the liches, the creatures, the news. Everyone I&#39;ve talked to agrees. The only way to survive was to not be fully human. That&#39;s all we know.

**Śląski:** Then how am I here?

**SCP-5825-L:** ...That&#39;s what I&#39;m wondering.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing statements:** The interview ended when SCP-5825-L left after this remark, citing boredom as her reason for not continuing.
[[/div]]

**Addendum 5825-B:** During an otherwise routine day, Researcher Śląski suddenly grew wings and other bird-like appendages. The transformation was seemingly reversed roughly 30 minutes later, but presented the possibility that SCP-5825 instances can spread the shifter phenomenon to baseline humans.
