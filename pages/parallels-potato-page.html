##red|Placeholder text! Potato coming soon##
**Name:** [[[SCP-7682]]]
**Type:** SCP
**My Thoughts:** This was a collab with [[*user SYTYCFanon]]! Its about a hard to catch reptile and a stressed researcher chasing after it. I helped write some of the capture logs, which were just as silly as I like to have them. I admittedly was in a bit of a slump as we were working on this, but I&#39;m happy with the product that we were able to get out.

**Name:** [[[SCP-7271]]]
**Type:** SCP
**My Thoughts:** Silly little microbes on a silly little strike! This was part of a challenge to write a successful article in 500 words or less. I also am a fan of lactofermenting my own pickles, which was the inspiration for this article. I channeled almost all my silly energy into this one, and I hope you like it!
[[image 7940%20Potato.jpg size=&#34;small&#34;]]
**Name:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7940 SCP-7940]
**Type:** SCP
**My thoughts:** A researcher who is trying to improve himself but is stifled by self doubt and a ceiling that represents that self-doubt. I think this SCP is just as much about me as it is about a fictional character. It&#39;s a reflection of how I always struggled with self-doubt going through college and my internship, and how I was able to do well in them despite that doubt. When it comes down to it, I&#39;m proud of both my little researcher dude and myself. I’m learning to not focus as much on my self-doubt, and I like to imagine 7940 does too eventually.
[[image 7127%20Potato.jpg size=&#34;small&#34;]]
**Name:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7127 SCP-7127]
**Type:** SCP
**My thoughts:** A story about a person in an emotionally abusive relationship trying to go shopping. This was a hard SCP to write. I wanted to show how even seemingly innocuous things can be used as a weapon by an abuser, and that emotional abuse can be just as damaging as physical abuse. If you think are in an abusive relationship, you can find a link to National Domestic Violence Hotline here: https://www.thehotline.org/
[[image DoA%20Potato.jpg size=&#34;small&#34;]]
**Name:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/acquisitions-training Department of Acquisitions Training Seminar]
**Type:** Tale
**My thoughts:** My first successful piece on the wiki, and it&#39;s about tomatoes being shot at field agent trainees. In my headcanon, I imagine there&#39;s a generalist department in charge of locating and bringing in most anomalies. This orientation was my attempt to bring that department to life in a fun way, while also showcasing how unknown anomalies would be contained in the field.
