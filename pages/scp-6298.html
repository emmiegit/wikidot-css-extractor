**Special Containment Procedures:** Any discovered SCP-6298 instances are to be contained within separate standard storage containment cells and kept at least 5 meters apart from each other. Foundation personnel are instructed to maintain a distance of 5 meters from any of the containment cells.

Any new SCP-6298 instances that are discovered are to be immediately secured and a non-anomalous replica of it to be created as its placement for safe use within public or private spaces. Class-B amnestics are to be applied to any civilians involved in the securing or replacement of SCP-6298 instances and their replicas.

Testing has confirmed that only the original, physical instances of SCP-6298 have anomalous properties, and thus only those copies are to be designed SCP-6298.

Foundation personnel within close proximity to SCP-6298 instances are to report for weekly psychological and physiological examination. Personnel found to be suffering sudden intrusive thoughts centred around themes of gateways, surrealism, deformed human figures, and/or death, as well as visual and auditory hallucinations, are to be immediately reassigned.

**Description:** SCP-6298 is a collection of artwork created by a now-deceased 75-year old human male residing in Warsaw, Poland, known primarily through their painting of dream-experienced dystopian surrealism as Zdzisław Beksiński. 

SCP-6298&#39;s anomalous traits elicit intrusive thoughts and hallucinations of a suspected Sarkic nature in individuals that view SCP-6298 instances. Individuals that are exposed for extended periods of time to SCP-6298 instances (particularly paintings of a dark or surreal tone), start to exhibit more physiological and psychological changes commonly attributed with Sarkicism, as well as becoming territorial of the influencing SCP-6298 instance. The duration required for these changes to occur decreases exponentially for each additional instance of SCP-6298 within close proximity, with 20+ instances requiring only seconds for permanent physiological effects to occur.

Since Zdzisław Beksiński&#39;s death on 21/02/2005, several witness reports have also claimed that figures resembling Beksiński were occasionally visible within SCP-6298 instances, only for the figure to disappear once line of sight with SCP-6298 had been broken. It is unclear whether this is an anomalous property of SCP-6298 or whether Beksiński also exhibited anomalous traits.

**Discovery:** Foundation personnel was first made aware of SCP-6298 when multiple police reports regarding suspicious activity being heard coming from inside the Cpzestochowa City Gallery were detected by Foundation surveillance teams.

During each of these police investigations, a member of the gallery&#39;s night watch staff was discovered muttering and shouting to themselves incoherently while apparently fixated an instance of SCP-6298 being exhibited at the gallery.

When approached by the local authorities, the gallery staff were often uncooperative and refused to be escorted from the premises. Once removed, however, they quickly regained their senses and were left without any memory of the altercation or even viewing the SCP-6298 instance.

It wasn&#39;t until Foundation agents conducted their own investigation within the Cpzestochowa City Gallery late at night on 20/02/2005 that a Sarkic entity was discovered in a basement storage room being used to store several of SCP-6298&#39;s instances.

One agent was severely wounded and another was killed while attempting to initially identify the entity. The entity was subsequently terminated in the ensuing conflict. A clean-up crew was later sent to the scene to incinerate both the entity and the deceased agent.

Once a clear connection between the SCP-6298 instances and their creator had been established, along with the strong probability of Sarkic involvement, MTF-Oneiric was sent to investigate the creator&#39;s residence and retrieve any SCP-6298 instances believed to be stored there.

**Addendum SCP-6298-1:** Retrieve of SCP-6298 Instances from Zdzisław Beksińsk&#39;s Place of Residence

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Access Addendum&#34; hide=&#34;- Hide Addendum&#34;]]

//Note: The following log is a transcription of audio and video recordings made by MTF-Oneiric while investigating the source from which SCP-6298 instances were believed to be created retrieving any SCP-6298 instances where possible.//

&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; //Body camera footage shows members of MTF-Oneiric quietly entering a block of flats under the cover of night and making their way up to the second floor. Agents halt in position around a front door leading into one of the flats.//
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-Oneiric-1:** MTF-Oneiric in position. Get ready to breach. Go!
&gt; 
&gt; //The front door is breached as the MTF piles into the small apartment. Oneiric-1 performs a quick sweep of a spare bedroom. With the exception of several SCP-6298 instances decorating the walls, nothing else untoward is discovered.//
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-Oneiric-2:** On me! I&#39;ve got something here!
&gt; 
&gt; //Body camera feed show Oneiric-1 moving into another nearby bedroom. The room is vacant but features instances of SCP-6298 and an empty, sheet-bare bed. Oneiric-2 and Oneiric-3 have their weapons aimed at the bed.//
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-Oneiric-1:** Hey! HEY! You in the bed! WAKE UP!
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-Oneiric-3:** Are they sleeping?
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-Oneiric-4:** There&#39;s something going on in the living room. All the paintings in here, they&#39;re...moving!? The walls are covered in them!
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-Oneiric-1:** Avert your gaze! Do not look at them!
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-Oneiric-4:** Shit, I can&#39;t...Shit, they&#39;re all looking at me!
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-Oneiric-1:** Oneiric-3, go in there and assist Oneiric-4.
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-Oneiric-3:** On it. Is anyone else getting...odd thoughts?
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-Oneiric-2:** Yeah...
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-Oneiric-1:** Keep your wits about you, reports are coming in that these paintings can mess with your head.
&gt; 
&gt; //Oneiric-3&#39;s body camera shows them moving through the flat and approaching Oneiric-4. Their back is turned to the camera as their head, arms, and body can be seen spasming. Incoherent babbling can also be heard coming from their direction.//
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-Oneiric-3:** Hey! Oneiric-4! HEY! You&#39;ve gotta turn around! NOW!
&gt; 
&gt; //Oneiric-4&#39;s body begins to slowly turn as Oneiric-3 raises their weapon. Oneiric-4&#39;s head swivels to reveal a red, fleshy visage with empty eyesockets. Their jaw begins to extend unnaturally as their head tilts backwards.//
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-Oneiric-3:** Oh shit!
&gt; 
&gt; //Oneiric-3 opens fire. Multiple bullets punch into the head of Oneiric-4 as it breaks into a dash. Despite the seemingly fatal damage caused to Oneiric-4, it continues moving at speed towards Oneiric-3. A wet impact is heard as Oneiric-3&#39;s body camera beings tilting upwards above the head of Oneiric-4. Oneiric-3&#39;s weapon can be seen falling to the ground, as sharp, ragged breathing is heard. Oneiric-4&#39;s arm comes into view, extending out below the body camera, its red flesh is covered in vine-like tendrils. The remains of Oneiric-4&#39;s head suddenly erupts in a shower of gore as gunfire is heard. Oneiric-4&#39;s body is seen collapsing as the body camera crashes to the ground. The video feed turns black.//
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-Oneiric-1:** Damnit! Command, we&#39;re two men down!
&gt; 
&gt; //Oneiric-1 and Oneiric-2 quickly turn from the corpses back towards the bedroom, weapons pointed at the bed.//
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-Oneiric-2:** What was that? Where did they go?
&gt; 
&gt;  **MTF-Oneiric-1:** Command, we&#39;ve got a situation developing here. The apartment is full of those paintings and an entity has gone missing with no obvious signs of escape.
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-Oneiric-2:** Oneiric-1? Can, can you see that? There&#39;s some sort of, portal there.
&gt; 
&gt; //Oneiric-1 turns to where Oneiric-2 is pointing. The visual feed displays the opened door leading into the spare room.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Command:** MTF-Oneiric, this is Command. We&#39;re not seeing anything on the video feeds, nor have we seen any additional entities. If you&#39;re confident a full sweep has been performed, we advise pulling out. A clean-up crew is on standby.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; **MTF-Oneiric-1:** Affrimative. Pulling out now.

**Addendum SCP-6298-2:** Increase in Sarkic Activity

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Access Addendum&#34; hide=&#34;- Hide Addendum&#34;]]

Since 21/05/2005, Foundation Surveillance Teams have noticed a significant increase in activity among Sarkic affiliated groups. Cases of museum-related theft and burglary at establishments that have at some time hosted work of Beksiński indicate that Sarkic cults are likely aware of the existence and significance of SCP-6298, and are making concentrated efforts to procure any instances of SCP-6298.

Private collectors are at particular risk and should be monitored and used to gather intel on any remaining SCP-6298 instances that aren&#39;t in Foundation control.

An investigation into Sarkicism&#39;s capabilities surrounding dream manipulation, the creation of anomalous artwork capable of eliciting Sarkic changes in individuals, and whether Zdzisław Beksiński had a history of Sarkic involvement, is currently ongoing.
