**Item #:** SCP-6298

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Instances of SCP-6298-1 are to be kept in communal groups in specialized acrylic aquariums of at least 200 gallons. 

A containment zone surrounding the natural habitat of SCP-6298-1 has been established. Any unauthorized personnel found to be trespassing are to be detained immediately, with lethal force authorized if necessary. Any instances of SCP-6298-1 encountered outside of the established containment zone are to be reported and contained immediately.

SCP-6298-2 must be closely monitored for abnormal behavior. Any Llaguaí diasporic peoples are to be brought into custody and administered Class G Amnestics before release.

As of Incident-6298-BR-1, all instances of SCP-6298-2 are held in a communal containment unit and kept under strict surveillance. Should an instance of SCP-6298-2 exhibit aggressive behavior towards personnel, use of sedative agents is permitted.

Personnel are required to report any ingestion of SCP-6298-1 or SCP-6298-1B immediately. Testing of SCP-6298-1B is prohibited in any facility that houses cognitohazardous, memetic, or telepathic anomalies.

**Description:** SCP-6298-1 is the designation for a species of freshwater ray-finned fish belonging to the genus //Symphysidon//. The distribution of SCP-6298-1 is significantly removed from current and historical ranges of other //Symphysidon// species; prior to Incident-6298-BR-1, it was primarily found in the slow-moving waters of the Cajatilla River, a tributary of the Caqueta River in southern Colombia. 

SCP-6298-1 secretes a neuroleptic substance, henceforth designated SCP-6298-1A, chemically similar to the antipsychotic medication haloperidol through mucus membranes present on epithelial tissue of instances of SCP-6298-1. Substance exhibits slightly higher potency than similar drugs available for public consumption. SCP-6298-1A has been found to be produced by SCP-6298-1 as a chemical byproduct of the synthesis of SCP-6298-1B.

SCP-6298-1B is a compound synthesized by SCP-6298-1 through unknown means that accumulates in the fatty tissue of instances of SCP-6298-1. SCP-6298-1B superficially exhibits a potent and rapid-onset psychoactive effect that has been determined to result from acute agonistic reactions affecting the ingesting subject&#39;s vulnerability and perception to cognitohazardous and telepathic stimuli. Subjects affected by SCP-6298-1B have been known to experience the anomalous effects of cognitohazardous, memetic, and telepathic objects as far as one kilometer from their source.

Artificial synthesis of SCP-6298-1A was achieved on 11/16/2019. Approval of field use pending Ethics Committee review.

Attempts to artificially synthesize SCP-6298-1B have yielded poor results, which can be viewed in document LabLog-6298-1B-A. 

Survey of the area surrounding SCP-6298-1&#39;s habitat resulted in the discovery of a tribe of indigenous peoples living in close proximity to the the habitat of SCP-6298-1, henceforth designated SCP-6298-2. SCP-6298-2 have developed a close cultural relationship with SCP-6298-1 involving the ritual consumption of SCP-6298-1 for religious purposes, facilitated by the anomalous properties of SCP-6298-1B. SCP-6298-2 display superficial cultural similarities to Tupi-Guarani peoples that inhabit the northwestern Amazon Basin; however, there are notable deviations presumably from their relationship with SCP-6298-1. Initial attempts at establishing contact with SCP-6298-2 have been unsuccessful due to linguistic unintelligibility.

**Addendum-1:** Establishment of a containment perimeter has resulted in the enforced evacuation of a small incorporated village approximately 20km from the primary habitat zone of SCP-6298-1. During evacuation, Foundation Agent ██████ Corbáro was approached by a local villager, ███████████ Chapuaní. A transcription of the encounter is provided below.

**Interviewed:** ███████████ Chapuaní

**Interviewer:** ██████ Corbáro

**Foreword:** Interview transcribed and translated from the original Spanish.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Chapuaní:** Look! Look! Hey! Look at me bastard! I know you can hear me!

//Corbáro does not respond and continues the process of escorting a villager. Chapuaní continues trailing behind Corbáro, attempting to goad him into conversation with expletives.//

**Chapuaní:** Look, I know you can hear me, why won&#39;t any of you idiots tell us why we&#39;re being moved around? Eh? We&#39;re not idiots, we can see that you are not loggers, we can see you are not cops, but nobody will tell us what is happening other than that we have to leave our chickens, our houses behind. And you! You! I can tell that you are Colombian! So answer me.

**Corbáro:** I cannot tell you why you are being evacuated, miss. Just wait quietly until another person can escort you. I can&#39;t help you.

**Chapuaní:** Oh, my grandmother- You can&#39;t just kick us out of our village for no reason. You can, but I won&#39;t let you. I can be as annoying as a mosquito. 

//Corbáro continues to ignore Chapuaní as she shouts strings of expletives at him. Chapuaní then forcibly grabs Corbáro&#39;s shoulder.//

**Corbáro:** Miss, if you continue disrupting, I&#39;m going to have to use force to-

**Chapuaní:** This is about the fish, isn&#39;t it?

//Corbáro freezes.//

**Corbáro:** That&#39;s classified information.

**Chapuaní:** I always knew it! No damn loggers would be this educated and organized, and the government doesn&#39;t give a shit out here either. It&#39;s about the fish, like it always is! But you people look different. Not sunburnt Americans in khakis. Who are you?

**Corbáro:** I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about and if you don&#39;t cooperate-

**Chapuaní:** You are a terrible liar. Your big boss man is going to be very mad at you. 

**Corbáro:** Miss-

**Chapuaní:** I am Llaguaí! 

//Chapuaní then utters a string of words in an unintelligible language enthusiastically. Corbáro displays a look of visible confusion.//

**Chapuaní:** You all already know about the pre-columbians that live around here, no? I am a member, there are quite a few of us in this village. The non-believers.

**Corbáro:** Quiet down! I hear you, I hear you. You can let go of me now.

**Chapuaní:** Oh! So, will you say why we must leave now?

**Corbáro:** You know I cannot say, but something tells me you already know why. You will tell me about the tribe, the Lláguai-

**Chapuaní:** accent í!

**Corbáro:** Sorry, Llaguaí. I&#39;ll be polite and give you my name, You call me Agent Corbáro.

**Chapuaní:** Well, Idiot Corbáro! Those of us here are all of us[sic] exiled by the priests for being nonbelievers. There are children too of older nonbelievers. But we were expelled. Peacefully, though. 

**Corbáro:** You speak the language too?

**Chapuaní:** Clearly, yes.

//Chapuaní speaks in the aforementioned unintelligible language, presumed to be Llaguaí.//

**Corbáro:** How many of you live here?

**Chapuaní:** There are 73 now, including the Chaco twins that were just born.

**Corbáro:** Please provide a list of their names and gather them. We&#39;ll be taking you all into custody to ask you questions.

**Chapuaní:** They won&#39;t go into no custody, neither will I, for that matter. You can&#39;t just kidnap us! And we don&#39;t even know why!

**Corbáro:** Do you think this rifle is for decoration? Do you?

//Chapuaní freezes.//

**Corbáro:** I&#39;m not afraid to use force and neither is anyone else here. We&#39;ll be taking you into custody for more information.

**Chapuaní:** Will we get to return home? Will you devils at least allow us that?

**Corbáro:** Of course. Just answer our questions and you can come home.

//Chapuaní hurriedly leaves Corbáro&#39;s immediate vicinity, calling out a variety of names, presumably those of the aforementioned villagers of SCP-6298-2 ancestry.//

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** 57 of the villagers contacted by Chapuaní voluntarily submitted to Foundation custody. Of the remaining 16, 3 were inadvertently terminated due to coercive force.

[[/collapsible]]

The 70 remaining villagers were successfully brought into Foundation custody. The 14 minors amongst them were provided suitable accommodations and care, while the remainder were transferred to basic holding cells for individual questioning. Superfluous interview logs have been excluded from this document, but are available upon request. 

Interview Logs 6298-2-B-2, 6298-2-B-17, and 6298-2-B-47 have been included as being relevant to SCP-6298 documentation.

**Interviewed:** ███████████ Chapuaní

**Interviewer:** Containment Specialist Natalia Rodriguez

**Foreword:** Interview transcribed and translated from the original Spanish. 

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Rodriguez:** Good afternoon, Mrs. Chapuaní, I&#39;m Dr. ████ Zaragoza, I will be asking you a few questions, if that&#39;s alright.

**Chapuaní:** Oh, thank god, finally! Finally, some feminine grace, not like those brute apes who kidnapped us. Yes I am doing alright, although I would rather be drinking chocolate in my little home.

**Rodriguez:** I&#39;m glad to hear, would you mind answering a few questions for me?

**Chapuaní:** Of course, you ask so politely.

**Rodriguez:** How exactly did you come to live in in ███████?

**Chapuaní:** I was born into the Llaguaí. My mama was a healer and my papa was a councilman. We had some status in the tribe but not too much. I was raised like everyone with the rituals and legends. Faith is very important in our culture.

**Rodriguez:** Can you describe the Llaguaí beliefs?

**Chapuaní:** They are simple. There are many stories of old prophets and heroes and their trials. But there&#39;s a god[[footnote]]The usage of the word &#39;god&#39; by Llaguaí is a result of linguistic traits of Spanish itself, it is not believed their belief system is monotheistic in nature.[[/footnote]] we don&#39;t speak a name for it. It exists hidden away from our human perception. There is a lot of violence in the world, we are violent creatures. God is cut off from the world it created and that&#39;s what causes all this tension in the world. Most of the rituals and ceremonies and festivals are supposed to open our minds to communication with God so that when the time comes, he can enter our world once more. That will bring peace to all. That&#39;s what they teach.

**Rodriguez:** These rituals involve the fish, correct?

**Chapuaní:** Some of them. Not all of them, no, no. I never consumed the Tlapí. That&#39;s what we call it. Some of the legends and myths told us that the fish were like chunks of flesh of the god from long ago, and that&#39;s why they opened us to it. But I never knew that, I saw the channelers who consumed the Tlapí, but I was never allowed to.

**Rodriguez:** Why is this?

**Chapuaní:** You have to be trained to receive it, for years. Most channelers spend their entire lives training to be able to receive it. They don&#39;t allow regular people to perform those rituals because they say the size of god will blind us, or make us mad. Do you know what I think?

**Rodriguez:** Go on.

**Chapuaní:** I think they need channelers who believe exactly as tradition tells us. I don&#39;t know what eating the Tlapí feels like, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s opening yourself up to god. I really don&#39;t. That&#39;s why I was exiled.

**Rodriguez:** Belief is a requirement in the tribe?

**Chapuaní:** Of course it is. The elders always say that non-believers in the god being part of the tribe is very dangerous. A sin. They can open themselves up to other spirits, dangerous ones. That&#39;s why they send us away. It isn&#39;t violent, but they do forbid us from coming back.

**Rodriguez:** It&#39;s interesting you say the exile is not violent, that&#39;s unusual. Is this how you all came to reside in the village?

**Chapuaní:** Yes, more or less. Not all of the exiles go to the village, some of them go elsewhere, others disappear completely. I&#39;m sure there are some in the big cities somewhere.

**Rodriguez:** That&#39;s concerning. Do you know of any way to find other Llaguaí living in the country?

**Chapuaní:** No. I don&#39;t know why you would need to, they mind their own business living as normal Colombians. Why are you clearing the area anyways?

**Rodriguez:** There&#39;s an investigation going on.

**Chapuaní:** Investigating what? Did they murder some loggers?

**Rodriguez:** I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t disclose any information.

**Chapuaní:** They are very strict here, I noticed. This is important stuff isn&#39;t it? You aren&#39;t affiliated with Colombia.

**Rodriguez:** I can&#39;t disclose any information regarding that. I have a few more questions I&#39;d like to ask.

//Chapuaní slumps back into the chair.//

**Rodriguez:** Miss?

//Chapuaní remains uncooperative for the remainder of the interview.//

**Rodriguez:** Subject refuses to speak further, concluding Interview-6298-2-2.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** Subject was escorted back to their holding cell without incident. A secondary attempt to interview was unsuccessful due to lack of cooperation.

**Interviewed:** ██████ Tuquinácha

**Interviewer:** Containment Specialist Natalia Rodriguez

**Foreword:** Interview transcribed and translated from original Spanish.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Rodriguez:** Afternoon, I&#39;m here to ask you some questions.

**Tuquinácha:** I&#39;m here.

**Rodriguez:** Can you tell me the circumstances that led to your exile?

**Tuquinácha:** I wavered.

**Rodriguez:** What do you mean by that?

**Tuquinácha:** I was born and blessed with feminine and masculine energies. I was raised as this to become a channeler of great importance. God does not relate to our man and woman ideas.

**Rodriguez:** If I understand correctly, your condition holds spiritual significance to the Llaguaí?

**Tuquinácha:** I am an ideal vessel for god. Simply put. But I was exiled eventually. All my life I was raised and taught with the expectation I would be a great priest and great spiritual man.

**Rodriguez:** What happened?

**Tuquinácha:** I have grown a family here in this village since I was exiled. I have a wife and she bore children by some miracle. I have come to know what happens to a child who is shepherded aggressively by both parent and village. They rebel.

//Tuqinácha leans back to cough.//

**Tuquinácha:** I am old and frail, but I still believe, in my own way. God is real, I believe. I saw him myself when I consumed the Tlapí. But god is not an agent of peace.

**Rodriguez:** You consumed the fish, in a ritual? We&#39;ve yet to encounter any of the villagers who participated directly.

**Tuquinácha:** Yes, I ate the fish. The Tlapí. It&#39;s a feeling difficult to describe. I am old and frail now,  but remembering it is like remembering something so wonderful it becomes terrible, and terrible it becomes wonderful. I don&#39;t know if words can describe something that isn&#39;t meant for us to know. But I was open.

**Rodriguez:** You mentioned your vision of god running contrary to what the dogma entailed, can you describe that a bit more to me?

**Tuquinácha:** It is not a dogma. They have their reasons for their traditions I&#39;m sure. I am still Llaguaí so I read to myself the heroes and stories of our ancestors. But something is wrong. What I received could not have been the love and peace of the god I was taught. That is why I was exiled. I do not know what I received even now, 30 years later.

**Rodriguez:** Would you be able to describe it to me? This malevolent force that you experienced?

**Tuquinácha:** I visited the great large city that rules over this land, Bogotá, as they say. Have you ever been to city that big?

**Rodriguez:** Yes, I have.

**Tuquinácha:** I felt the same feeling when I saw the city.

**Rodriguez:** What do you mean by that?

**Tuquinácha:** I don&#39;t know. That&#39;s what I felt. I had to leave. I&#39;m old now, and I don&#39;t remember it as clearly as I used to. I spent a long time in a depression and I only ever left when I met my wife. That was when I had seen the city.

**Rodriguez:** You lived outside of the village?

**Tuquinácha:** For a time. When I was younger, after I was exiled, I wanted to reach the antithesis of anything that meant anything to god. Rejection of faith and the Tlapí and my Llaguaí culture. There are others there too. After I met my wife we returned to the village and I started praying again. I&#39;m much happier now, or before your people came and brought us here.

**Rodriguez:** What made you want to come back? Did you feel compelled to by an unknown force?

**Tuquinácha:** The world I saw when I left the Llaguaí made me wish I could go back.

**Rodriguez:** I&#39;m not sure I understand what you&#39;re saying. What could make you miss the tribal life so badly after all that?

**Tuquinácha:** I have no doubt you don&#39;t understand. It is understandable. Paisanos would never understand. You could live as many years as I have and you still wouldn&#39;t understand until you&#39;ve lived a day in our skin.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** Subject released from interview due to signs of of duress. Subject has experienced declining health in custody and has expressed desire to be released.

**Interviewed:** ███████ Chiquí

**Interviewer:** Containment Specialist Natalia Rodriguez

**Foreword:** Interview transcribed and translated from original Spanish.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Rodriguez:** Hello. I&#39;m going to ask you a few questions, is that okay?

**Chiquí:** Go ahead. Better than waiting in the cell all day.

**Rodriguez:** It says here on intake papers that you were actually born in ██████, this is true?

**Chiquí:** Yeah. My mom was Llaguaí. My dad is Paisano.

**Rodriguez:** Was?

**Chiquí:** Yes, she passed 2 years ago. From malaria.

**Rodriguez:** Sorry for your loss. How would you describe your childhood?

**Chiquí:** It was happy. Boring, but happy. There&#39;s not a lot to do out here in the country. I would listen to the old stories the older Llaguaí women would tell, but other than that I worked with the animals in the little farm we had. My mom taught me to speak the mother tongue growing up but she didn&#39;t talk much about her people. 

**Rodriguez:** Were you raised in any religion?

**Chiquí:** Not really. Papá would read some bible verses to me and we would pray sometimes, but that was it. Mom never talked about religion.

//Chiquí lets out a slight chuckle.//

**Rodriguez:** What&#39;s funny?

**Chiquí:** Ma used to scold me whenever I asked her about stories when I was little. She didn&#39;t want to tell me any of the traditional fairytales. I was always curious though. Used to sneak out at night to go over to Tita&#39;s house at night and she would tell these amazing stories to us kids who had parents who didn&#39;t care about the culture.

**Rodriguez:** You sought these out on your own?

**Chiquí:** Oh yeah, I mean, the older people, they treated these stories so important and put so much effort into telling them, it was such a good way to pass time from boring country life. I didn&#39;t believe them though, Jesus is my faith, but they seemed like they were from another world. A world where magic is real.

**Rodriguez:** Do you know any of these tales still?

**Chiquí:** They were a while ago, and I forgot most of them. As I got older I wanted to be more serious. Those tales can only entertain me for so long. I managed to convince papá to let me go to school in the city. But there&#39;s one I can remember, one of the most important ones. About a man so powerful he shaped the world for his own reasons, to make it beautiful. I forget the details but he had an enemy who loved the ugliness because he was ugly as well, and he feared this man would erase him for his ugliness. So the enemy, this demon, he fought against the man and won, and used a spell to cut his body into thousands of pieces. But he had a moment of mercy, and heard the man&#39;s pleas to stay beautiful. They say the chunks ended up becoming the beautiful fish here in our jungles and lakes.

**Rodriguez:** I appreciate you sharing that story. You mentioned that you went to public school, correct? 

**Chiquí:** Yes, in █████████.

**Rodriguez:** Is there a particular reason you wanted to go to school outside of the village?

**Chiquí:** Isn&#39;t it obvious? I&#39;m a young guy. Us young people aren&#39;t built for the village life and old spirits and tales. They&#39;re cute when we&#39;re kids but it&#39;s a modern world here. There&#39;s more than just our pueblo. I was going to go to police academy.

**Rodriguez:** You wanted to be in law enforcement?

**Chiquí:** Do you blame me? Look at all this cool shit you guys get to do! I would kill to be able to work here. There&#39;s probably never a dull moment. No cleaning chicken shit.

//Rodriguez lets out a laugh.//

**Rodriguez:** There certainly isn&#39;t. Thank you for cooperating with us. I don&#39;t have anymore questions at this moment, but there is something I&#39;d like to discuss with my higher ups.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** Subject was escorted back to holding without incident. Containment Specialist Natalia Rodriguez has since put forward a proposal to hire ███████ Chiquí as an official translator due to subject&#39;s combined fluency in Llaguaí and cooperative nature.
[[/div]]
[[/collapsible]]

**Addendum-2:** The request to employ ███████ Chiquí as an official Foundation translator to facilitate communication with SCP-6298-2 has been approved. Chiquí will be heavily monitored for signs of psychological duress or defection. Containment Specialist Natalia Rodriguez has been appointed provisional director of SCP-6298-1&#39;s containment site. 

**Addendum-3:** Following successful establishment of communication with SCP-6298-2, utilizing Agent Chiquí as an official liaison, SCP-6298-2 became cooperative with Foundation research of their tribe under the guise of personnel seeking to adhere to SCP-6298-2&#39;s religious beliefs.

SCP-6298-3 is the tentative designation for a powerful memetic and cognitohazardous entity that is currently known only to affect SCP-6298-2 instances who have ingested SCP-6298-1B. 

Subjects affected by SCP-6298-3 will display severely disordered cognition and perception as well as altered interaction with reality. An affected instance will also typically experience involuntary muscle movements and tremors, sometimes manifesting as stiff, repetitive gestural movements. The vocal folds of an individual may also be affected, resulting in unintelligible speech. 

SCP-6298-2 instances that occupy a high ranking theological position within the tribe are assigned the task of interpreting the physical movements and speech of the affected instance into the Llaguaí language for spiritual purposes. Typical interpretations usually relate to fertility or personal morality, although in rarer instances the interpretations have included apocalyptic or esoteric themes.

Attempts to interview instances of SCP-6298-2 that have been affected by SCP-6298-3 have had limited success, with most instances refusing to do so on grounds of spiritual inexperience. It is only known from Interview-6298-2-B-17 that the effects manifest to the subject as a possibly sentient entity that forms the basis of SCP-6298-2&#39;s spiritual beliefs.

There is ongoing debate whether SCP-6298-3 is a phenomenon related to SCP-6298-1, or simply a byproduct of the effects of SCP-6298-1B. (See Interview-6298-2-A-3)

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Chiquí:** Good day, holiness.

**SCP-6298-137:** Good day, boy. How have you been?

**Chiquí:** I&#39;ve been good. Attuned to all. I wanted to ask some questions, about our people&#39;s history. I don&#39;t know much about the ways of the Llaguaí other than the tongue.

**SCP-6298-137:** Ask away. We old are here to share our wisdom.

**Chiquí:** How old is the village here?

**SCP-6298-137:** We&#39;ve lived here and built here for over 10 generations, possibly more, but there may have been other Llaguaí living here before that. We are an old people.

**Chiquí:** Do you know how old exactly the Llaguaí are? 

**SCP-6298-137:** It is impossible to know for sure. Knowledge like this comes and wanes with each passing generation. But we were one of, if not the first people to begin opening ourselves up to god and the ever-presence.

**Chiquí:** It&#39;s like a game of telephone, all the traditional stories.

//SCP-6298-137 displays a look of visible confusion.//

**Chiquí:** Ah, sorry, just a thought to myself. I didn&#39;t know that the village isn&#39;t the homeland. Do you know where our ancestral homeland was?

**SCP-6298-137:** I myself am not sure. I think it could be deduced from our histories and stories but I do not know, I have never left our village in my life. But this is the village we congregated to after the revelation of the Tlapí.

**Chiquí:** Oh, so the Tlapí are only found here?

**SCP-6298-137:** Not necessarily, but this is the flock we were made aware of. I&#39;m sure there are fragments all throughout the world, but we are small people and the world is large. Here, god is abundant, and the Tlapí are numerous and easy to harvest.

**Chiquí:** I remember the myth of the ancient man, Kuíllápu, the beautiful man. How the Tlapí descend from him before, but I&#39;m eager to hear of more histories of our people.

**SCP-6298-137:** Do you know of the fire people? That story of Kuíllápu, the children love that one. But his nemesis, Atawan, he intervened once against us. Men of fire in beards and fire in hair, shining white men adorned with flames, ravaged areas hidden to us. Many generations ago. Dozens of outsiders came and hid in our homes and grasses, fleeing these flaming people.

**Chiquí:** The Llaguaí were originally more accepting of outsiders?

**SCP-6298-137:** Oh yes, of course. I know of tales that speak of our old cities of stone and metal, when many would flock to hear our poems and know god and taste the Tlapí. 

**Chiquí:** What happened?

**SCP-6298-137:** Those fire people, they were followers of Atawan, and our prophets heard of their hidden powers, how they moved with a hidden force in their trail that could kill whole villages. We lived in silence for a time, hearing of these demons through the people who hid amongst us. Eventually one day, two of these fire people came here, adorned in heavy suits of white stars. They came with spears of diamond and flaming crowns, and spoke in a tongue cruel to our ears. One of the refugees told us they were asking us if we knew god. 

//Chiquí begins writing notes.//

**SCP-6298-137:** Those odd pictures you make, what do they mean?

**Chiquí:** It&#39;s writing- It&#39;s a way to put the words you speak onto a paper or tablet so I can remember them later.

**SCP-6298-137:** How odd. But back to this story, yes? The people did not know if the fire men would ruin us like they had others, some questioned if god would intervene. But one man among us rose, the hero Guatán, who said out loud to the refugee &#34;Tell them I will fight them!&#34; He had received a free spark of inspiration and messaging.

**Chiquí:** He received a vision?

**SCP-6298-137:** Perhaps a vision directly from god, he was chosen, maybe he was directly open to god. He told, through the refugee that the fire men had the choice for the Llaguaí to fight with spears or with fish.

**Chiquí:** And so they picked the fish?

**SCP-6298-137:** Yes!

//SCP-6298-137 laughs.//

**SCP-6298-137:** The fire men in their hubris picked to fight against the men armed with fish. Guatán left them for a moment, and returned with a bowl of prepared Tlapí, and spoke, &#34;The deliciousness of our cooking will reveal to you our belief in god.&#34; Guatán had cursed and prayed in their name asking for these wicked agents of Atawan to be smited. 

**Chiquí:** Do you know if these fire men had names? I think I could find more information on them if-

**SCP-6298-137:** No, I don&#39;t know exactly, if they did, they have been lost to time. These stories are passed down for generations, some things are bound to be lost.

**Chiquí:** What a shame. I would love to be able to hear the stories straight from the lips of the ones who first told them.

**SCP-6298-137:** I am not a good enough storyteller to you?

**Chiquí:** No it&#39;s not that, I-

//SCP-6298-2-137 changes his facial expression from stern to a smile, before laughing.//

**SCP-6298-137:** I am simply joking, do not worry. You are so eager to learn, you thirst for knowledge from dried up wells. It is an admirable trait, but take caution that you don&#39;t end up drinking from a poisoned well. We have wandered from the story greatly. I will continue now.

**Chiquí:** Apologies for interrupting, I will listen again.

**SCP-6298-137:** Where was I? Ah... The fire men speculated, wavering their bright red flames, before each took a bite of the Tlapí. The wickedness in their hearts was opened up to the ever-presence, and they were smited with madness. Guatán spoke to all the people &#34;We are the ones most beloved by god. Life favors us, and no harm will come to us if we keep pious and open!&#34; The fire men disappeared, enraged and maddened, into the forests. We never heard an uttering from them since and after. Guatán was a hero to our people and the entire world.

**Chiquí:** That was a wonderful telling, ██████. It illuminates me more of your people.

**SCP-6298-137:** They are your people too, it&#39;s your bloodline. You have changed my thoughts in some regards, the failings of the father or mother shouldn&#39;t pass to the son. We enjoy you here, even if those who follow you seem rather strange.

**Chiquí:** Ah, thank you. The learning I&#39;ve had here has been incredible, there&#39;s a lot of things I had never thought about before. Tell me, the Tlapí can smite others in god&#39;s name?

**SCP-6298-137:** It can. Only we Llaguaí who know of the debt owed to ever-presence and its mechanisms, we can open up to god. Others who are not so knowing can open themselves up to many other terrible things, though. The wicked will see their failures reflected back at them.

**Chiquí:** Well, thank you for taking the time to recount to me. I have some other things I need to do. But thank you again.

**SCP-6298-2-137:** Of course. And make sure to eat, you look too skinny! 

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** Interview concluded without incidence. 
[[/div]]
[[/collapsible]]

Attempts to replicate SCP-6298-3 using isolated doses of SCP-6298-1B on test subjects in custody has been unsuccessful, only resulting in the display of non-specific cognitohazardous or anomalous symptoms, or in rarer cases, resulting in symptoms matching the effects of other cognitohazardous/memetic/telepathic SCP-Objects contained in relative proximity to the test subject.

**Addendum-4:** Incident-6298-BR-1: --For unknown reasons,-- SCP-6298-2 abruptly became hostile to Foundation personnel during a traditional ritual performed using SCP-6298-1. Instances of SCP-6298-2 were described by personnel onsite as displaying highly erratic behavior, including symptoms of acute psychosis. 7 field agents were lost, including Agent Chiquí. Initial attempts at restoring order were unsuccessful, resulting in lethal force being approved. ███ instances of SCP-6298-2 were terminated, ██ of which were retroactively deemed unnecessary. A significant number of SCP-6298-2 were lost to disease in the week following their arrival and initial containment. There are currently ██ instances of SCP-6298-2 being held in a large communal containment unit.

&gt; I fail to see any reason why the original SCP-6298-2 settlement can&#39;t be bolstered with additional security measures for the future. Is it really necessary to keep all instances of SCP-6298-2 in custody without knowing the future status of SCP-6298-1?
&gt; -Containment Site Director Natalia Rodriguez
&gt; 
&gt;  Causal relationships between Incident-6298-BR-1 and SCP-6298-3 are still being examined. The potential threat posed by the now aggressive SCP-6298-2 is too great to allow the possibility of additional careless containment breaches.
&gt;  -Director ████ Marsh

Following the successful de-escalation and detainment of all known instances of SCP-6298-2 within the SCP-6298 containment zone, an investigation into the circumstances of the incident was conducted, revealing an external containment breach by unknown party(s). The breach was located in the northeastern quadrant of the containment zone, approximately ██km from the nearby village of ██████, where former SCP-6298-2 instances were originally encountered.

Disturbances in the mud deposits indicate amateur efforts were made to conceal human shoe tracks.

An immediate effort to verify any tampering with SCP-6298-1 containment was made. There were no signs of SCP-6298-1 present in the waters they previously occupied with the exception of several deceased instances found along the banks. Attempts to locate any surviving instances further downstream were unsuccessful. 

Staff responsible for overseeing the containment procedures for SCP-6298 were questioned in regards to the breach. Containment Site Director Natalia Rodriguez was interviewed in the aftermath in attempts to ascertain possible suspects responsible for the breach.

**Interviewed:** CSD Natalia Rodriguez

**Interviewer:** Breach Recovery Specialist ███████ Peterson

**Foreword:** Inquiry conducted following the re-establishment of order following Incident-6298-BR-1. 

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Peterson:** Good afternoon.

**Rodriguez:** Never a good afternoon when there&#39;s a personnel loss.

**Peterson:** Yeah, well you know the drill by now.

**Rodriguez:** Is there a reason I&#39;m being questioned instead of the on-site personnel?

**Peterson:** We&#39;ll get to that. I&#39;m gonna be the one asking questions though, keep in mind.

**Rodriguez:** Yeah, yeah, what do you want to know.

**Peterson:** According to our findings, the breach was caused by outside forces, most likely humans, with possible parascientific intentions. Are you aware of any attempts by outside forces to breach SCP-6298&#39;s containment prior to this incident?

**Rodriguez:** No, I&#39;m not. And I find it highly unlikely that the motivations are parascientific, that assumption strikes me as conjecture. There are numerous logger companies that are active in the region.

**Peterson:** Loggers don&#39;t typically abduct fish.

**Rodriguez:** SCP-6298-1 were taken today? Why didnt any of my staff inform me of this?

**Peterson:** We&#39;re informing you now. The investigative team sent out found them missing from the river 3-ish hours ago. That&#39;s more or less why we&#39;re interviewing you.

**Rodriguez:** This ought to be the weirdest lay-off interview I&#39;ve ever had. So we have, what? Fish kidnappers? 

**Peterson:** It would appear so. To be honest I assumed you would have known about any attempts made by groups to enter the area.

**Rodriguez:** Why would I know anything about that? Honestly we&#39;ve never had the slightest outside activity near the containment site. There&#39;s been the odd lost hunter or logger or two, but nobody has ever been found directly seeking to enter. Not even from the village where we found Chiquí, god rest him.

**Peterson:** There&#39;ve been no attempted breaches at all before this?

**Rodriguez:** No there haven&#39;t.

//Peterson sinks back in the chair, pinching his nose.//

**Peterson:** That doesn&#39;t strike you as odd? In a region notorious for illegal activity in forested regions?

**Rodriguez:** I think, I think we may need to review our surveillance logs.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** Natalia Rodriguez relieved from questioning. Further disciplinary measures due to negligence are pending review. Investigation of logs relating to SCP-6298 containment was immediately launched under suspicions of tampering through anomalous or non-anomalous means.

**Addendum-5:** The investigation into the circumstances surrounding Incident-6298-BR-1 yielded information pertaining to an underground illicit trade in SCP-6298-1 instances. Data storage onsite was found to have been corrupted using anomalous means by the party(s) responsible for the breach. The method used appears to have been crude and left behind several partially or fully unaffected pieces of information, including surveillance footage that captured several frames of the intruders. Frame analysis was able to decipher the text present on one of the subject&#39;s clothing as indicating &#34;TrueAquaria.com&#34;.

Research indicates the organization is an online retail company specializing in South American fish species, claiming to be a leading provider of &#34;ethically sourced tropical fish&#34;. There is no superficial evidence to indicate anomalous activity on the site, and the listings for available products correspond to typical tropical fish available to consumers on the mainstream marketplace. 

███████████ Chapuaní was questioned on the topic after it was noticed that her initial contact with Foundation personnel in Interview-6298-2-B-1 had referenced poacher activity in the area.

**Interviewed:** ███████████ Chapuaní

**Interviewer:** Dr. Natalia Rodriguez

**Foreword:** Interview transcribed and translated from original Spanish.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Rodriguez:** Hey so I&#39;ve got some questions for you, if you&#39;re willing to answer.

**Chapuaní:** Fuck you! Assholes, you can&#39;t keep us here forever!

**Rodriguez:** Miss, could you please calm down?

**Chapuaní:** I&#39;m not talking to you again.

//Chapuaní appears to be making eye contact directly with the surveillance camera.//

**Chapuaní:** Hey, you can hear me. I know you can, idiot! Get us the fuck out of this facility! You&#39;ve had us here for years! When are we going to get our fucking homes back, ah? 

**Rodriguez:** Miss if you could please calm down, I just need to know a few things.

**Chapuaní:** You are all terrible liars! You think I can&#39;t tell? You say the same thing every time. That you just need to ask questions. That we&#39;ll be going home soon. You think we are idiots because we are from the country? It&#39;s been 3 years! So fuck you, and your questions.

**Rodriguez:** Listen, I really am just trying to help.

**Chapuaní:** You call this helping us?

**Rodriguez:** You&#39;re held here for your own safety. You did come here on your own free will. We have logs.

**Chapuaní:** You&#39;re even stupider than you look! Of course I came here. What choice did I have. I should be back home by now, I&#39;m so sick and tired of the questions. Always the que-

**Rodriguez:** Listen! If you answer the questions you can go home!

**Chapuaní:** You&#39;re a sack of shit. I want to speak to your boss!

**Rodriguez:** I mean it! I&#39;ll figure something out with the higher ups.

//Chapuaní appears to calm down and return her gaze to Rodriguez.//

**Chapuaní:** You&#39;re lying.

**Rodriguez:** I&#39;m not. I&#39;m really not. These questions are important for everyone&#39;s safety. I can give you my word.

//Chapuaní does not speak for several seconds.//

**Rodriguez:** Honest.

**Chapuaní:** What do you want?

**Rodriguez:** What do you know about the poaching groups?

**Chapuaní:** Oh-

//Chapuaní bursts in loud, hysterical laughter.//

**Chapuaní:** After all these years-

**Rodriguez:** Miss?

**Chapuaní:** It was all about the fucking fish! Hah! Those stupid little Tlapí? 

**Rodriguez:** There was an incident involving poachers that we believe is very serious. Please, what do you know about them?

**Chapuaní:** They take the fish, they poach them. Isn&#39;t that what poachers do? Do I look like a doctor of poaching?

//Rodriguez produces a photo bearing the logo of &#34;TrueAquaria.com&#34;.//

**Rodriguez:** Have you seen this logo before?

//Chapuaní squints while observing.//

**Chapuaní:** Yes, I have, this was one of the groups that would take the fish.

**Rodriguez:** One of them? There&#39;s multiple of them?

**Chapuaní:** Yes, there were a few. Some more professional than others. That&#39;s why I thought your company was one of these poaching groups. But you&#39;re not are you? Are you investigating them?

**Rodriguez:** We may or may not be. If they are involved in trafficking the fish, we need to know. Our own specimens are safe but-

**Chapuaní:** So you are poachers too, then? 

**Rodriguez:** No, we&#39;re a scientific organization, and we&#39;ve become responsible for the Symphysidon species&#39; conservation as well as the conservation of the Llaguaí tribe.

**Chapuaní:** It sounds to me that you&#39;re just like them.

**Rodriguez:** This is a tangent. Do you know anything about why these groups collect the fish?

**Chapuaní:** I heard from my friend Talia that in the city young people do all sorts of drugs. There&#39;s your answer. A good answer too. One that I assure is good enough for us to be let back into our damn village.

**Rodriguez:** I&#39;m going to do everything I can to make sure that happens, I just have one more-

**Chapuaní:** No. No more questions, I told you everything I know.

**Rodriguez:** I just.

**Chapuaní:** I can&#39;t tell you anything else, even if you rudely insist I know more, I don&#39;t. Tell the idiots to take me back to the cell.

**Rodriguez:** Subject wishes to terminate interview.

//Armed guards arrive to escort Chapuaní back to her holding cell. Chapuaní shouts at a loud volume while leaving, presumably towards Rodriguez.//

**Chapuaní:** Tell Corbáro he&#39;s a terrible fucking liar!

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** Dr. Natalia Rodriguez to be questioned regarding unprofessionalism during interview.

An attempt to infiltrate the party(s) behind &#34;TrueAquaria.com&#34; resulted in a successful purchase of SCP-6298-1 instances by Agent ████ Nuñez. A regular pattern of business was established to build trust between &#34;TrueAquaria.com&#34; and Agent Nuñez with the goal of eventually bringing an affiliate into Foundation custody.

**Addendum-6:** Agent Nuñez was contacted by an affiliate of &#34;TrueAquaria.com&#34; via text message detailing a potential business opportunity and arranging a meeting in person at the organization&#39;s facility.

A task force of 60 specialized Agents was assembled for a sting operation on the &#34;TrueAquaria.com&#34; office. Agent Nuñez was assigned as squad leader. Upon arrival at the address indicated by the distributor affiliate, task force members surrounded the facility while a smaller team of 20 was sent in. Inside the facility were 8 employees as well as a large room fitted with equipment for storing live fish. ██ instances of SCP-6298-1 were recovered from the facility.

Upon questioning, the employees identified themselves as the Owner, CEO, CFO, General Manager, Retail Manager, Shipment Manager, IT Manager, and Customer Service Representative, respectively. 

Through questioning it was determined that these were the entirety of the organization&#39;s operations. In addition, the employees were able to provide a list of other organizations involved in the trafficking of SCP-6298-1, though the owner, when questioned, boasted they were definitively the largest dealer of anomalous fish on the market.

A complete list of all information collected by &#34;TrueAquaria.com&#34; regarding clients can be accessed by request only.

&gt; Due to the extremely amateur nature of TrueAquaria.com&#39;s operations, I&#39;d like to perform an additional internal investigation into the containment breach myself.
&gt; 
&gt; -Director ████ Marsh

**Addendum-7:** Request to form a specialized task force responsible for tracking down SCP-6298-1 trafficking organizations and instances of SCP-6298-1 sold by them has been approved.

Further testing attempts to identify the nature of SCP-6298-3 have failed to reproduce the effects that caused Incident-6298-BR-1. SCP-6298-1B testing in D-Class personnel have not yielded any instances of SCP-6298-3 influence.

Request to form a large scale operation to locate diaspora Llaguaí pending O5 approval. All Llaguaí held in Foundation custody have been administered Class G Amnestics and provided new identities upon release.

**Marsh:** So, here we are Natalia.

**Rodriguez:** Paul.

**Marsh:** I can&#39;t say I&#39;m surprised you ended up here.

**Rodriguez:** Why is that?

**Marsh:** You always had your strong convictions. That used to be the Foundation and its goals. Not sure what it is nowadays.

**Rodriguez:** You say that like it&#39;s a bad thing.

**Marsh:** For all we care, it is, in fact, a very bad thing. Cuckoo fish getting loose into the world is a bad thing. It&#39;s a bad thing for our jobs, a bad thing for normalcy, bad thing-

**Rodriguez:** I&#39;m so sick of that fucking word. Normalcy.

**Marsh:** Well what other damn word you want us to use? You basically allowed an SCP to go missing under your watch. Or are we wrong?

**Rodriguez:** It was barely even worth containing.

**Marsh:** Who are you to make that call? You&#39;re not an overseer, never even were close to a full fledged Site Director. You were fun and all when we were still training but you never had the restraint to make it higher than you did. Nobody wants a feisty, &#34;free spirit&#34; anywhere near the kill codes. Sorry, that&#39;s how things work.

**Rodriguez:** There it is.

**Marsh:** What?

**Rodriguez:** You know it jumps out and you don&#39;t even notice it. My point remains, I have always from the very beginning failed to understand why we even took SCP-6298 as seriously as we did. It&#39;s barely, and I literally mean barely, an anomaly. Honestly, they got very lucky we found that tribe, very, very lucky, do you know why?

**Marsh:** Natalia what in the ever-loving fuck does this have to do with the reason you allowed those poachers to breach containment? I know it&#39;s never about just the reward with you.

**Rodriguez:** You know, I never fucking agreed with the idea of testing cognitohazards on the Llaguaí. I thought that going to those lengths to justify something&#39;s containment was a fucking waste of-

**Marsh:** Is that what it&#39;s about, Natalia? Did you feel it was beneath you?

**Rodriguez:** No, that&#39;s not- Learn to let a woman speak, Marsh. The whole thing doesn&#39;t strike you as questionable? I mean we&#39;ve done some very questionable things here, but usually the threat justifies the means, right? I mean it has to.

**Marsh:** What are you even talking about anymore?

**Rodriguez:** SCP-1036.

**Marsh:** What about it.

**Rodriguez:** You know exactly what I&#39;m getting at, don&#39;t play dumb. How many thousands of years were SCP-1036 being created in central Africa before we acquired them? Do you know?

**Marsh:** No, I don&#39;t. Can you get off the soapbox and to the point?

**Rodriguez:** What is normalcy? What is normal in our current day and age? We have technology people couldn&#39;t even dream of a hundred years ago. Our organization is supposed to keep things cool and normal, and maybe, just maybe we get to save a few thousand lives along the way, but this... this is something else entirely.

**Marsh:** The threat SCP-6298-3 could&#39;ve posed before we determined its nature was immeasurable.

**Rodriguez:** You know, I&#39;m half shocked there wasn&#39;t any attempt to write off SCP-6298-2 as a Scarlet King cult or something. &#34;Bunch of uncivilized wackjobs eat psychic fish and worship an entity? Oh we need to investigate possible relationships to the Scarlet King immediately!&#34; That sounds like something an eager researcher would do. But Eureka! It just turned out to be mild, and I do mean mild, distortions of whatever force a person is already exposed to.

**Marsh:** You can&#39;t be serious about this, Natalia. These fish you say are so fucking mundane, this cannot be worth throwing away a career over.

**Rodriguez:** You did say I had my convictions, Paul. We wiped out an entire culture and religion over a fish that packs less of a punch than the pot brownies they bake in Denver nowadays. All for the sake of normalcy. It&#39;s all about keeping the world unaware of the anomalous and paranormal. But I&#39;ll tell you what. [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1036|SCP-1036]]] was normal for hundreds of years before us. Those SCP-6298-1 were normal for hundreds of years before us. Why do we get to decide what&#39;s normal and what isn&#39;t?

**Marsh:** This is the mission we took on. You&#39;re not a fresh-nosed bleeding heart from the city anymore, you&#39;re a failed guard dog who took a bone from a burglar. Don&#39;t waste my time. You know the damn slogan at this point, Natalia.

**Rodriguez:** Yeah, I do. &#34;We die in the dark so you live in the light.&#34; Funny, I could almost see Rudyard Kipling saying something like that.

[[/div]]

&gt; Dr. Rodriguez has repeatedly displayed an inability to provide a coherent answer when questioned about her and her team&#39;s collusion with SCP-6298-1 trafficking organizations. I suggest ceasing investigative efforts and hereafter propose a motion to terminate all involved personnel.
