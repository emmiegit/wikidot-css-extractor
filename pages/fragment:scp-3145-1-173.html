    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Item #:** SCP-3145

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3145 is to be kept in a locked container at all times. The enclosure must be cleaned biweekly. Personnel are to enter SCP-3145&#39;s container in groups of no less than 3, with the door locked behind them. Two personnel must maintain continual direct eye contact with SCP-3145 until all personnel have vacated and relocked the container. Personnel are to alert one another before blinking.

Any change in sounds originating from SCP-3145&#39;s containment chamber should be reported to the HCML supervisor on duty.

**Description:** SCP-3145 is a sculpture constructed from concrete and rebar, with traces of Krylon brand spray paint. Its origin is unknown.

SCP-3145 is animate, but cannot move while in direct line of sight of a human being. When a human breaks eye contact with SCP-3145, it will move at high speed and attack the individual, typically by snapping the neck at the base of the skull. Strangulation has also been employed.

When SCP-3145 is not under observation, personnel have reported sounds of scraping stone within its chamber. A reddish substance, a combination of human feces and blood, has also been observed on the floor of SCP-3145&#39;s chamber. Though SCP-3145 is believed to be the origin of this material, the actual source of SCP-3145&#39;s means of producing it are currently unknown.

**Addendum: Interview 3145-01**

&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-3145
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Falzon
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** A change in the sounds coming from SCP-3145&#39;s chamber was reported on 04/09/94 to Dr. Falzon, HCML supervisor on duty. Investigation led to SCP-3145 requesting an interview. A screened porthole was installed in the chamber door to facilitate communication.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log, 09:50&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Falzon:** How are you finding your accommodations, SCP-3145?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3145:** Not bad, not bad. You know, I really appreciate you guys cleaning up after me. Honestly, I don&#39;t even know where that stuff comes from.
&gt; 
&gt; **Falzon:** It&#39;s the least we can do. Is there anything I can get you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3145:** Well, uh. //[laughs]// Maybe train your D-Class a little better? I mean, not //too// good, I don&#39;t want to kill them //all//. But they&#39;ve been screwing up pretty bad lately, and I like a little challenge.
&gt; 
&gt; **Falzon:** I see. I suppose I shouldn&#39;t have expected anything else.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3145:** Hey, don&#39;t judge. Being an unstoppable, well, //mostly// unstoppable, killing machine is fun!
&gt; 
&gt; **Falzon:** Fair enough. Is there anything else I can do for you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3145:** No, I think I&#39;m good. Thanks for the screen, though. Nice to get some fresh air in here for once. //[laughs]//
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log, 10:01&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Request to leave porthole open when SCP-3145 not under observation denied. Investigation of the origins of both the materials found in SCP-3145&#39;s chamber and its ability to vocalize are ongoing.</textarea></pre>
