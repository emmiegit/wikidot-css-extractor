**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7083 can teleport under the direction of the site&#39;s original owner, limiting long-term containment of the site. It is currently located on the border of Alaska and the Yukon Territory of Canada, approximately 9.5 kilometers from the closest civilian population[[footnote]] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle,_Alaska Eagle] [[/footnote]].

[[include component:image-block | name= https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/313822165206171660/1107168823431401523/Interior.png| caption= Current SCP-7083 Interior]]

The anomaly is under the oversight of Mobile Outpost 106, which monitors the site&#39;s perimeter and is responsible for the tracking and containment of the site following a Relocation Event.

Foundation personnel are to monitor all known travel routes near the SCP-7083 manifestation point. Any civilians caught attempting to observe or enter SCP-7083 are to be remanded to the custody of the nearest authorities and administered Class-B amnestics.

The interior of the anomaly is to be kept under constant visual surveillance, and any signs of SCP-7083-3 instances attempting to get across the barrier require the intervention of MTF-Theta-42 &#34;Open Worlders”, a joint task force drawing from a number of other MTFs skilled in animal handling, wilderness survival/exploration, traversing unstable realities, puzzle solving and platforming.

SCP-7083-1 is under the purview of MTF-Kappa-43 &#34;The Mediators&#34; and functions as an early warning system for a Relocation Event, as the reappearance of advertisements and online mentions of upcoming streams is the first sign that the cycle is about to begin again.  

**Description:** SCP-7083 is a spatial anomaly that is represented by an area approximately 21k in diameter in diameter in the shape of an octagon girded by a 5-meter-high chainlink fence. A singular gate on the southernmost side of the fence allows entry into the pocket-dimension’s interior.  

The anomaly manifests, excluding one notable instance, in isolated wilderness areas. Observations have found that the terrain inside the pocket dimension matches the exterior, excluding the manifestation of a wooden cabin in the direct center of the newly entrapped area.

[[include component:image-block | name= https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/313822165206171660/1107185374448590929/cabin.jpg | caption=Current Cabin Manifestation]]

This changes when undergoing an “Active Hunt” Event.

During an “Active Hunt” the terrain inside the pocket dimension will shift, creating new topography that makes traversing the expanse increasingly difficult. The overall climate and flora of the interior do not change, excluding more frequent meteorological events.

At this time, SCP-7083 partially phases out of baseline reality, becoming invisible to the naked eye and intangible, allowing civilians and Foundation personnel to pass through the entire area without interfering with the events inside.

Following the Activation of a “Hunt”, twenty instances of SCP-7083-2 manifest in sets of five randomly across the interior. That is then followed by the full manifestation of SCP-7083-1 across the globe and the appearance of SCP-7083-3 and -4 instances within the interior.

The SCP-7083-2 instances are then required to fight and survive within the confines of the site until only five instances remain alive. (See the **SCP-7083-2** entry for further information.)

When only five of the SCP-7083-2 instances are left, SCP-7083-5 manifests. 

When all but one of the SCP-7083-2 instances and the SCP-7083-5 manifestation are dead, the &#34;Active Hunt&#34; ends.

Then SCP-7083-1 ceases, and the area lies dormant, excluding any remaining SCP-7083-3 instances extant within the interior. After three years, SCP-7083 begins a Relocation Event, vanishing and reappearing in a new random location after a period of four months, and begins the cycle anew.

Descriptions of the Constituent Parts are as follows.

**SCP-7083-1** is the designation for a streamed series named &#34;VVondertainment&#39;s Wild Hunt”, often simply referred to as “Hunt” in marketing advertisements, which is produced by Arcadia[[footnote]] [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/arcadia-hub Arcadia] [[/footnote]] in --partnership with Dr. Wondertainment--(See Incident 7083-1 for Clarification) alongside a rogue element of GAW[[footnote]] [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/gamers-against-weed-hub GAW] [[/footnote]] --and an unknown financier that is believed to be the true owner of SCP-7083.--(See **Agent Maldanis&#39;s Exploration Log**.)

The name is now believed to be an attempt at obfuscating the true intentions of the events that transpire within the &#34;series.”

A perception filter placed upon the videos causes the event to appear to be taking place inside a digital environment based on real locales the arena has surrounded.

The streams follow twenty individuals (SCP-7083-2) as they attempt to survive against their fellow contestants and the surrounding environment.

The show was first discovered in 201█ by Foundation Web Crawlers on Twitch, and despite Foundation attempts to curtail the spread of the show through the usage of amnestics and web crawlers, it has since expanded its portfolio.

&#34;VVondertainment&#39;s Wild Hunt&#34; can be found on any active streaming service, video-sharing website, or forum page when a Hunt is Active. It can even manifest as a pay-per-view television replacing any of the expected events for the length of the Hunt&#39;s duration.

The anomaly is live-streamed with very few cuts or edits, and once the Hunt has finished, all online media surrounding the event vanishes after 24 hours.  

This does not appear to affect copies made from recording the event, and the Foundation has a backlog of SCP-7083-1 &#34;Seasons&#34; onsite at Mobile Outpost 106.

The appearance of advertisements for the latest &#34;season&#34; of SCP-7083 is now used by the Foundation to anticipate Relocation Events.

The Hunt was the first trial humanity learned to perfect.

//A scene of Neolithic humans taking down a mammoth plays.//

Risking our lives so that we could fill our stomachs as the sky grew dark.

Fighting to win against nature and often our fellow man!

//A shot of a man screaming cartoonishly as a clearly fake spear is stabbed &#34;into&#34; his chest cuts across the screen.//

But now, everything you could ever want is handed to you on a silver platter.

To fight, to hunt, to //**THRIVE**// is unnecessary.

//An image of a morbidly obese adult man nearly choking on a meatball sub fills the screen.//

But there are those that still know what it means to Hunt.

To //live.//

//Rapid series of scenes pass by of people fighting against animals, each other, androids, and other monsters flash across the screen.//

Sure, they&#39;re better than you. (Actually have their shit together.)

//The last line above is mumbled in a way that makes it seem like it wasn&#39;t meant to be captured in the announcement.//

But at least you get to enjoy the show!

VVondertainment&#39;s Wild Hunt returns this Winter with 20 of the greatest fighters, outdoorsfolk, and athletes currently walking this languid mudball!

One will emerge victorious and claim their prize as every victor before them!

//A shadowed figure stands atop a pile of corpses, both human and animalian, holding an outlandishly colored gun above their heads, an even larger monstrous shadow looming behind them.//

Or all will prove wanting!

Find out next month!

VVondertainment&#39;s Wild Hunt can be found on any available streaming platform, pay-per-view channel, and some Free Port theaters. Check your local listings!

**SCP-7083-2** is the designation for the twenty individuals that appear within SCP-7083 at the beginning of the Hunt. They randomly appear across the area in five groups of four.

SCP-7083-2 are adult humans in peak physical condition drawn from the worldwide populace, and while within SCP-7083, each gains an instinctual understanding of any languages spoken by those within the site.

Each individual is a highly-skilled member of one of the following demographics:
* military service (private or state-enforced)
* hitmen
* undercover agents
* outdoorsmen (professional or hobbyist)
* first responders
* professional athletes
* serial killers

--The Foundation has yet to discover the exact manner in which these individuals are chosen and transported to SCP-7083.--(Undergoing revisions, see Agent Maldanis&#39;s Exploration Log)

Each team is made up of varying demographics drawn from that pool in an apparent attempt to add balance among the groups.

Each appears with a hunting knife, a fully-loaded Tokarev pistol with two additional ammo clips, a canteen of water, a backpack with camping supplies, and fifty &#34;credits,” flat gold-colored plastic chips that are only used in interactions with SCP-7083-4 instances.

All gear can be traded amongst individuals, excluding credits, which can only be taken by killing their owner, which adds the amount they carried to the assailant&#39;s inventory.  	 

SCP-7083-2 instances are expected to fight for their survival within the site, and attempts to protest through hunger or drinking strikes fail as the instances have been biologically altered, leaving them unable to die from starvation or dehydration.

Purposeful self-termination is also &#34;disallowed&#34; by SCP-7083, with attempts leading to guns jamming, knives blunting, skin resisting damage, or other minor reality shifts that keep the subject alive.

The only way out of SCP-7083 is through death by combat or connected to combat, whether with fellow -2s or against instances of SCP-7083-3.

Upon death, SCP-7083-2 instances vanish in a flash of blue light, leaving behind any gear they collected during the Hunt.

Upon completion of the Active Hunt, depending on the outcome surrounding SCP-7083-5, 19 or all of the SCP-7083-2 instances appear alive once more outside of the site, returned to their lives with no memory of the time lost within SCP-7083.   

Through the administration of nestics, the Foundation has learned from the affected individuals that the longer one remains in SCP-7083, the stronger the drive becomes to kill proactively, going out of their way to hunt SCP-7083-3 instances and their fellow prisoners.

This is believed to be a combination of stress and a latent cognitohazard that heightens the aggression of the trapped SCP-7083-2 instances. MTF-Theta-42 must undergo regular screenings for any side of cognitohazardous effects upon returning from their patrols.

The suddenness of this aggression varies by individual and has been noted to cause the splintering of the initial teams far earlier than is required by SCP-7083. (See the **SCP-7083-5** entry for further information.)

**SCP-7083-3** is the designation for the spontaneously generated animals that appear after the arrival of SCP-7083-2.

They closely resemble the typical fauna of the area SCP-7083 manifests, most commonly taking the forms of predators and large herbivores that live in the region.

These instances differ from baseline variants in behavioral patterns.

Firstly, all SCP-7083-3 instances lack any inborn fear of humans, attacking them on sight without any attempts at commonly understood warning displays or intimidation tactics.

Secondly, while the instances follow baseline predator-prey patterns amongst themselves, they will break off any combat upon scenting, sighting, or otherwise detecting a human presence.

Thirdly, most commonly seen amongst predatory instances, even amongst species that do not regularly engage in pack-hunting or communal habitation, they are drawn to areas already prevalent with their own kind and move throughout SCP-7083 in unison.

The current iteration exemplifies this with a pack of five instances resembling Kodiak bears that often engage with MTF-Theta-42 patrols.

Once a day, a unique instance of SCP-7083-3, designated SCP-7083-3a, will appear within the arena, referred to by interviewed SCP-7083-2&#39;s as a &#34;Elite&#34;, which they claim they feel compelled to hunt down and kill immediately.

These SCP-7083-3a instances differ from the baseline instances in a variety of ways. Most commonly, they manifest as baseline predatory instances with greater size, damage resistance, enhanced stealth, lethality, or speed.

Rarely, the SCP-7083-3a instances have resembled living nonnative species, extinct species, or common descriptions of local cryptids.

If not killed, the 3a instances proliferate as the mechanism that manifests them appears to function without any overarching oversight.

Current 3a instances include a Persian leopard, an American lion, and an altered musk ox that has managed to evade capture or termination by Foundation forces.

All SCP-7083-3 instances vanish upon death, leaving behind carefully prepared pieces of meat and cured hide for SCP-7083-2&#39;s usage and a set number of credits.

Testing has confirmed that the produced material matches the genetic markers of the species of the slain instance.

&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Wondertainment LR:** ##purple|....we would hope that you get in contact with us, as friendly relationships are what we seek to covet at all times.##
&gt;
&gt; **Researcher Wekt:** Hello?
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Wondertainment LR:** ##Purple|Is this Ms. Wekt?##
&gt;
&gt; **Researcher Wekt:** Yes, how did yo-
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Wondertainment LR:** ##purple|That isn&#39;t important. I am calling you to inform you that you are on the verge of publishing libel.##
&gt;
&gt; **Researcher Wekt:** I&#39;m sorry?
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Wondertainment LR:** ##purple|That is appreciated, Miss, but that does not change the fact that you and, therefore, the Foundation is infringing upon the good name of Dr. Wondertainment.##
&gt;
&gt; **Junior Researcher Tate:** Can you explain what this is about, please?
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Wondertainment LR:** ##purple|Ah, are you with Legal? No matter, this call is about the article currently resting upon your computer regarding the &#34;VVondertainment&#39;s Wild Hunt&#34; television series and the spurious claim that our company has anything to do with the event or the mechanisms stored within the connecting site.##
&gt;
&gt; **Researcher Wekt:** You aren&#39;t?
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Wondertainment LR:** ##purple|No! Bloodsport hasn&#39;t been in as a form of child entertainment since at least the ‘50s. We at Dr. Wondertainment stay on the cutting edge of fun and merrymaking. We would never have a direct hand in something of this caliber.##  
&gt;
&gt; **Junior Researcher Tate:** You&#39;re claiming whoever is behind this is, what, stealing your IP?
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Wondertainment LR:** ##purple|Aping our IP. We are a universal top-selling brand. Even bootlegs sell //wonders//. Though why anyone thought this would pass muster is beyond me. Though... it does appear to have tricked you, eggheads, at the Foundation... hmmm...##
&gt;
&gt; **Junior Researcher Tate:** Why is that? The name?
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Wondertainment LR:** ##purple|That should have been obvious. What are you paying that one, Ms. Wekt? It might be more than they deserve. No, there is one glaring problem with the branding of the Vendors.##
&gt;
&gt; **Researcher Wekt:** That being?
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Wondertainment LR:** ##purple|Well... it&#39;s //green// obviously.##
&gt;
&gt; **Researcher Wekt:** So, back to your original point, you want us to remove reference to your organization regarding this SCP?
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Wondertainment LR:** ##purple|Yes, quick and easy without resorting to legal beat-em-ups. Though... if you could name the party that is using our branding without our consent, I can promise we are Dr. Wondertainment will be ever so grateful.##
&gt;
&gt; **Researcher Wekt:** I believe that could be arrang-
&gt;
&gt; **Arcadia LR:** There won&#39;t be any need for that. We here at Arcadia are willing to clear up this problem.
&gt;
&gt; **Researcher Wekt:** How did-
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Wondertainment LR:** ##purple|Now that legal is involved, you are finally willing to parlay. That is a naughty thing to do there, boys.##
&gt;
&gt; **Arcadia LR:** We are willing to offer a number of forms of restitution for our associate&#39;s rather... propriety-infringing sense of humor.
&gt;
&gt; **Researcher Wekt:** Your associate? Who are you working wi-
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Wondertainment LR:** ##purple|It&#39;s a battle royale, Miss. What form of media is most closely tied to that affair any longer? Video games. What little group of troublemakers do you know that loves those? Outside of our friends here, of course. Slow on the uptake these ones.##
&gt;
&gt; **Arcadia LR:** Oh, absolutely. Would you like a cut of the profits offered by our financier, preferential ad time, or sponsored products within the Vendors? All are on the table, as long as this curtails any further talk of legal recourse.
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Wondertainment LR:** ##purple|I would have to take this to the higher-ups, but this could lead to a beneficial compromise. What items would you be interested in for the Vendors?##
&gt;
&gt; **Researcher Wekt:** Excuse me...
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Wondertainment LR:** ##purple|Oh, apologies, Miss, you are no longer needed. We apologize for the inconvenience.##
&gt;
&gt; **Arcadia LR:** Have a good day. //The sound of Wekt&#39;s phone hanging up is heard.//
&gt;
&gt; **Junior Researcher Tate:** The fuck was that?
&gt;
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt;
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Foundation personnel removed references to Dr. Wondertainment&#39;s involvement in SCP-7083 outside of the emergent deal between the organization and Arcadia. The following week all Foundation personnel awoke to find a purple-foil-wrapped thank-you basket resting next to their bedsides. GAW came under further scrutiny by Foundation watchdogs, though it is believed the person currently employed by Arcadia and the &#34;Financier&#34; is a breakaway element, likely a single individual.
[[/collapsible]]

These machines were made to mimic the branding and whimsical stylization of Dr. Wondertainment products, but the true manufacturer is believed to be a rogue element of the GAW.

Through the usage of credits, SCP-7083-2 instances can purchase weaponry, ammunition, body armor, healing items, miscellaneous additional gear, and notably, &#34;power-ups&#34;, and even the ability to resurrect one of the fallen SCP-7083-2 instances. However, it requires the purchaser to have formerly been on the same team as the individual.

The power-ups are varied, but all grant the user minor physical upgrades such as increased strength, speed, endurance, damage reduction, etc. The exact number of effects has yet to be cataloged.

Occasionally, when purchasing an item, the Vendor will create a powerful anomalous version of the item. Interviewed SCP-7083-2 referred to these as &#34;Legendaries.&#34;

&#34;Legendary&#34; weapons and armor pieces have outlandish names that are displayed by a hologram when picked up. Examples include Wondertainment&#39;s Wallbanger, the Mesh that Hates, Homerunner, and Ion&#39;s Immolator.

These items gave their wielders advantages against their opponents, such as limitless ammo, elemental infusion, superhuman strength, immunity to small arms fire, and terrain manipulation, just to name a handful of abilities mentioned by the interviewees.

These items would vanish after three days, regardless of if the purchaser had gotten a chance to use them or not. This disallowed hoarding of overpowered weaponry and meant that such items, if rewarded, would need to be used effectively and immediately, further heightening the aggression of the one in possession of them.  

Credits, as mentioned above, are the only way to receive new gear that isn&#39;t taken off another SCP-7083-2 instance, and to gain credits, all an individual has to do is kill.

Killing another individual rewarded the highest amount of credits, followed by SCP-7083-3a instances, predatory SCP-7083-3 instances, and herbivorous SCP-7083-3 instances.

**SCP-7083-5** is the designation given to the entity that manifests within SCP-7083 once only five SCP-7083-2 instances remain.

At that point, regardless of if any individuals remain on teams, they are separated and teleported to the edge of the internal area of SCP-7083. SCP-7083-5 appears in the direct center of the arena, outside of the cabin.

Interviewed SCP-7083-2 instances claimed to immediately know exactly where they had to go in reference to the cabin and were compelled to kill anything that got in their way of doing so.

The SCP-7083-5 instances are immense beings with wildly varying forms, no two have looked the same, and each has shown a varied mixture of defense and abilities that they use to slaughter the SCP-7083-2 instances. Some are recognizable enemies from various popular video games, and others show signs of cyberization or mutations in line with Sarkic manipulations.

The Active Hunt ends when either SCP-7083-5 is killed or all remaining SCP-7083-2 instances die. In the latter scenario, the former entity continues to stalk the interior of SCP-7083 until the area teleports to a new locale.

In the former, the remaining SCP-7083-2 instance enters the cabin and vanishes without a trace, unlike all other SCP-7083-2 instances. Foundation personnel attempted numerous times to follow the winner inside the cabin but were rebuffed by thaumic wards that caused the afflicted personnel to fall unconscious after sudden and acute blood loss from their eyes, nose, and ears. That was until Agent Maldanis (See connected **Exploration Log** for more information).

This hunt was the first the Foundation was made aware of and the longest to date.

As it was still in the early stages, the kidnapped individuals attempted to find any way out that didn&#39;t involve killing each other.

The five teams became entrenched, and the ruins of their &#34;civilizations&#34; can still be found in ensuing SCP-7083 iterations.

None.

All remaining SCP-7083-2 instances died during the fight against this manifestation of SCP-7083-5.

All instances were tracked down following the end of the Hunt, having no memory of the event as expected.

The individual closest to succeeding, Julia Vargos, US Combat Medic, mentioned a feeling of unexplainable loss and deep embarrassment during the investigation.

Julia Vargos had been killed by the accidental firing of her last opponent&#39;s weapon as he was consumed.

Ms. Vargos has been hiding in a tree, preparing to fire upon the SCP-7083-5 manifestation, and the misfire grazed her, causing her to fall and snap her neck.

Mr. Westlin didn&#39;t kill the SCP-7083-5 instance.

His fellow contestant, Amano Ren, a professional hitman, had struck the killing blow with Wondertainment&#39;s Wallbanger (A gun that shoots a literal wall at something) by sticking their arm in its mouth and pulling the trigger.

Ren had believed Mr. Westlin was already dead from a bite. 

Yet, the man had broken his own petrified arm off, empowered by the anomalous body armor he had been wearing, and proceeded to bludgeon Mr. Amano to death with it before crawling into the awaiting cabin.  

Designation: MIA.

This was the first Hunt that took place in a populated area. The site&#39;s intangibility and invisibility meant that regular civilians were able to funnel through the area without coming to harm.

The SCP-7083-2 instances, however, could see other people, and the first several days of the hunt were spent by the various teams attempting to get the attention of the people around them; to no avail. 

The Foundation still set up a cordon around the area and put out a cover story about a bureaucratic mishap that had left an area of streets under constant construction for the foreseeable future.

**Exploration Video Log Transcript**

**Date:** 1st Nov. 202█ - 15th February 202█

**Exploration Team:** Agent Maldanis Solo-Expedition.

**Subject:** Exploration of Interior of Active SCP-7083.
-----

**DATE:**  1st Nov. 202█

**NOTE:** The exploration log began after Agent Maldanis made contact with Mobile Outpost 106&#39;s lead researcher Morgan Tathers about an email.
---- 
[BEGIN LOG]

**Dr. Tathers:** You wished to see me, Agent?

**Agent Maldanis:** Yes, Ma’am, we&#39;ve been looking for an in on the central cabin in 7083, right?

**Dr. Tathers:** Yes, why do you ask?

**Agent Maldanis:** Well, Ma’am, it seems like I just got a personal invitation to the party.

//Agent Maldanis gestures to the terminal before him, where an email sits open, holding an audio bar and a pulsing bit of text that reads: LEARN MORE! The email was sent by the Arcadia Hiring Office.//

**Agent Maldanis:** Take a listen.

//He hits play.//

**Arcadia Spokesperson:** Hey there, GEOFFREY MALDANIS! You&#39;ve been a Foundation MTF Agent for ten years. Hasn&#39;t the job gotten stale? Don&#39;t you want to test yourself? To step into the arena and return what it means to truly be alive?! After so long, things over here have also started getting stale, so we need some… //new// blood to enter the mix. We&#39;re hiring for the blood-pumpingest, adrenaline-chargingest, mind-alteringest job out there! You and I already know you&#39;re skilled. Why not prove it to the world? Only one will be left standing. Will it be you? Click below to learn more! -**Sponsored by Arcadia.**

**Agent Maldanis:** Thought I should wait before clicking the beeping neon waver there. What do you think?

**Dr. Tathers:** A unique opportunity, perhaps the only one we’ll get. Go get outfitted. I will contact Command and see what they think.

**Agent Maldanis:** Understood.

**NOTE:** It was decided that Agent Maldanis would enter SCP-7083, and after being outfitted with a video camera and voice recorder, he was told to click the &#34;Learn More&#34; tab.

The moment he clicked it, he vanished.

Further corroboration is required to understand if this is the baseline mode of transporting individuals to SCP-7083.

Agent Maldanis made contact the next day, shortly after SCP-7083-1 went live. Foundation personnel was disallowed to enter the site to not interfere with Agent Maldanis&#39;s mission, and he was to be kept under observation through the use of SCP-7083-1.     
----

**2nd Nov. 202█:** Day 1. They, whoever &#34;they&#34; are, took the camera — so going to be relying on the recorder for the time being.

They were &#34;kind&#34; enough to give me and the other contestants winter combat gear outside of the standard cache.

Not sure where we are; just know it’s //freezing//. Snow goes up to my shins.

Trying to find someplace to bunker down.

The others are spooked, obviously.

Well, almost all of them.

There&#39;s one, a Chinese woman late thirties. She&#39;s oddly calm about the whole situation.

Will report more after we get to safety. Signing off.   

**3rd Nov. 202█:** Day 2. We finally found someplace to rest. Copse of pine trees, the woman I spoke about set up a blind to shield us from the wind and sight.

Spotted a few SCP-7083-3 instances on the way here. Looked like wolves. Saw us, so I imagine a whole pack of them are on their way. I made sure we set up a watch.

It felt odd, but I chose to learn who the other SCP-7083-2 instances are and where they are from.

The Chinese woman&#39;s name is Zhao Ai. She&#39;s very tight-lipped about her origin and seems put off that we can all understand her. I think she&#39;s military.

The others are in no particular order:

Molly Briggman, an American firefighter out of Brooklyn, was a combat medic in Syria. Likes to talk. Might be nerves. 

Paulo Dalikos, Italian, a &#34;fixer&#34; working in the Iberian and Italian theaters. Has that look about him. The one where you feel unsafe putting your back to him. Gonna need to keep an eye.

Iveta Reznyaha, Russian, is an Olympian-level trap shooter. Currently crying herself to sleep.

Felt weird asking them this stuff.

End of the day, they all need to die so I can get what I need.

And with that dark thought, signing off.

**5th Nov. 202█:** Day 4. 

SCP-7083-3 instances attacked all day yesterday, at least fifty of them. Wolves and black bears. Had to make makeshift spears. Dalikos was wounded.

Had to break camp and move on, but between the five of us, we now have a moderate pile of credits.

Or had. Found one of the SCP-7083-4s today. It had batteries for the recorder in it. So //they// know what I&#39;m doing.

Purchased healing items and an assault rifle. Others similarly stocked up. Going to make camp a bit back from the Vendor and see if anyone else shows.    

Signing off.

**7th Nov. 202█:** Day 6. 

Ran into another team finally.

Briggman attempted to parlay. He lost an ear. Zhao and Iveta downed one of theirs, and I winged one.

He… he was Chaos Insurgency, wearing the patch emblazoned on his helmet. Only shot at me after I popped up cause he didn&#39;t like seeing my tags.

//A pleasant tune interrupts him an ad begins to play both to and from the Recorder.//

**Hungry but don&#39;t want to leave the stream in case you miss a carnage-filled moment? Try Ambrose-To-Go! Fantastical Flavors and Eldritch Eats at your Finger Tips! Ambrose Restaurants, We Make the Anomalous Appetizing!**

//The ad ends.//

The fuck was th-? Right, guess we should expect more of that going forward.

Doc was wondering what they meant by &#34;new blood&#34;. I have a hunch.

Signing off.

**16th Nov. 202█:** Day 15. 

Dalikos and Iveta are dead.

But so are four other people from one of the other teams. Not the insurgencies, unfortunately.

Briggman got his hands on a grenade launcher. Enough said there.

But in the mayhem, Iveta went down. 

Dalikos had shot her in the back of the skull, thought no one would notice in the chaos.

Pity him.

//A tune plays, and Agent Maldanis pauses.//

**If you enjoy this show, we invite you to watch our associate&#39;s programming. Cooking with Karcist, Flip that Mecha, and Calypso&#39;s Isle are just a few of the prime television they offer at VKTM. Vikander-Kneed Technical Media, They&#39;re here for you!**

//The ad ends//

That is constant, by the way. I&#39;ve had to bury this thing in my backpack under a bunch of MREs and bandages just to keep it quiet when we are on the move.

What was I talking about again...

Right.

This place...we know it changes people. Makes them more prone to murder. Just didn&#39;t think it would be this quick.

Told Ai and Briggman. They agreed - no place in this game for snakes.

Domed him while he slept.

Felt right.

I...have to pay attention to the watch. 3a instance was spotted sniffing around the battlefield. Signing off.

**12th Dec. 202█:** Day 27. 

Apologies, been difficult. Two teams decided to work together against the three of us.

Leader of the alliance screamed about me being a &#34;Jailer&#34; when I kneecapped him. 

Other one had clockwork eyes, but they ran off. Hunch confirmed. //They//&#39;re recruiting from GoI&#39;s now.

It... it is getting hard not to want to go out and hunt things down. Ten against three, and I //longed// for the fight. Could see it in the others too.

Briggman was a talker, a sweet guy who kept us patched up. He doesn&#39;t talk much anymore, except about hunting the -3s.

Ai is handling it best. She’s opened up to us, mainly me, over the fire when we kept watch. People&#39;s Liberation Army, definitely seen combat before, but won&#39;t say where. She&#39;s funny in her own way.

Finally got one of those &#34;legendary&#34; weapons out of a Vendor. Ion&#39;s Immolator. Flash-burns anything it hits. Planning on going after a -3a with it tomorrow. Hope we run across that Insurgency fucker.

Signing off. 

**25th Dec. 202█:** Day 40.

Merry Christmas! Briggman died.

Scouting out a cave, looking for shelter from the blizzard outside. -3s got him, three polar bears. Ai and I killed them. He had heart. We shouldn&#39;t make him relive this when it&#39;s over.

//Another ad begins to play, and the Agent stops talking.//

**Cursed doll haunting your attic? Family heirloom angry about your life choices? Your Tarot deck only conveying doom in your future? We&#39;re here to help. MC&amp;D is willing to buy your cursed curios! Find no better prices anywhere. Just give us a call at 555-031-MCND.**

//The Agent makes no comment about the ad and simply continues his thoughts.//

We put his gear outside the entrance, along with the meat, see if it attracts any scavengers.

If Ai can be patient, then so can I.

This place. It almost makes you hungry for the kill. We can&#39;t starve, but on the days when we find nothing... there is this ache in my stomach, like hunger pains. I can ignore it, hold it back for now, but…

//He falls silent for several minutes.//

My turn for watch. Signing off.

**26th Dec. 202█:** Day 41

The trap worked. 

**3rd Jan. 202█:** Day 49

I&#39;m in trouble. Apparently, while you can&#39;t starve or off yourself in this place, you //can// get hypothermia.

Long story short, I fell in a river.

Another long story short, we&#39;ve got a new teammate.

Ryan, the person with clockwork eyes from before, a Mekhanite. The Insurgency&#39;s team wiped out the rest of their alliance. Ai made a pact with them.

Didn&#39;t have a say.

She&#39;s been looking after the both of us. 

This place... it changes more than you’d think. Perspective comes quick. Bonds form fast or break even faster.

She...I don&#39;t want to have to kill her at the end of this.

**18th Jan. 202█:** Day 64 I think. 

Ryan died. Pit trap - fell in before Ai, or I could stop them. Screams brought -3s, Moose, bout a dozen of them.

Had to stop it.

Shot Ryan.

//An ad plays.//

**She calls to you. She is already part of your everyday life. Without her, where would we be? She calls to you, and so do we. Join us at the Church of Maxwellism, found wherever the grace of WAN&#39;s connection can be felt.**

//It ends with Agent Maldanis not acknowledging it once more.//

Had to.

I... I don&#39;t like the rush I got.

**31st Jan. 202█:** Day: What Does it Matter.

There are only five of us left.

Happened while we were asleep. 

The cabin is calling us.

My thoughts are filled with killing the others. To hunt them, to prove that I am the apex.

The Insurgent still lives. I can feel it in my blood. I will not let him beat me.

None of them will beat me!

I... can I kill Ai?

**5th Feb. 202█:** Day Lost Track.

I saw it.

The SCP-7083-5 Manifestation. It&#39;s massive. A bear wrapped in metal and sparking wires.

It attacked two of the remaining combatants while they were fighting. I had planned to kill them from afar, unseen.

It slaughtered them.

Complete carnage.

It... it was glorious.

That leaves just me, Ai, and the Insurgent...

I need to hunt. I need to find a Vendor.

**15th Feb. 202█:** Day: The End.

It&#39;s over.

They&#39;re all dead. The beast, the Insurgent, Ai...

Not sure how I am still breathing.

It... it wants me to come inside. 

But the rest of the noise in my head is...clearing. I hope.

I got lucky. Vendor had a miniature nuclear device, like the ones in that one video game.

Fed it to the -5, along with the insurgent&#39;s body. Shot its eyes out beforehand, and it went berserk.

The Insurgent nearly had me, but Ai... took the bullet for me. Blew his fucking head off with the shotgun I&#39;d bought. 

Insurgent down, -5 down.

Just Ai left.

She smiled at me as I pointed the pistol. 

I want this to be over.

**NOTE:** At this point, contact was lost with Agent Maldanis as he entered the cabin. SCP-7083-1 ended as per the norm. MTF-Theta-42 entered SCP-7083 and made their way to the cabin, discovering that they could enter the cabin. Inside, they found signs of a scuffle and his recorder resting in the center of a polished oaken table. No other sign of Agent Maldanis could be found.

[End Log] 
-----
**NOTE:** The normal cycle of SCP-7083 was further disrupted as an audio message was emailed to Dr. Tathers. This message is recorded below: 

[[div class=&#34;email&#34;]]
[[div class=&#34;tofrom&#34;]]
**To:** Dr. Tathers
**From:** The Financier
**Subject:** The Hunt
[[/div]]
------
You&#39;ve been watching us for some time now, and we you. You interrupted our work once before, so we...adapted to the changing times. We rebuilt our crucible. We brought back the majesty of the Hunt, of Battle, of True Humanity! With a few quirks here and there to keep it interesting to the mind-numb sheep you have allowed our people to become.

And now...now one of yours has joined the fold. Not your best, but he will do. The Family is proud to count him among us.

But this time of trial is over; the Architect is ready.

So we won&#39;t keep you waiting any longer. My friends, if you would?

**ANNOUNCING: Season 23: The Black Battlegrounds**
The Hunt continues with Season 23, but we&#39;ve really upped the ante with these ones, folks! Hold on to the edge of your seats because the fights start Now! Well...close to now.

**Closing Statement** Following the announcement, Mobile Outpost 106 prepared for SCP-7083 to move locations. Instead, their sensors detected the sudden manifestation of three new instances of SCP-7083. The first at Point Nemo[[footnote]][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_of_inaccessibility Point Nemo][[/footnote]] in the Pacific Ocean, the second at the bottom of Veryovkina Cave in Abkhazia/Georgia[[footnote]][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veryovkina_Cave Veryovkina][[/footnote]] and the last in the middle of the Sea of Tranquility on Luna.

Foundation personnel are en route to each of these locations, and the SCP-7083-1 instances are slated to begin within 24 hrs of reporting.

The Financier is now believed to be a current or former member of the Black Lodge, a Neo-Sarkic organization with a focus on strength and battle. The victors of SCP-7083 are now believed to have been indoctrinated into the service of the Lodge. An investigation into the matter is pending.
