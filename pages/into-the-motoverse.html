//##D21C1C|Access Denied. Invalid Credentials.##//

&#34;Ugh, this again? What&#39;s Carl even doing?&#34; The newest addition to Site-250 muttered. &#34;Maybe Director Hyuse can do something about Carl?&#34; Kira switched tabs, figuring out how to address the older woman.

I know I&#39;m just a junior researcher, but seriously? Everyone has to be trolling me, and I hate it. I can&#39;t even get my work done like this. Can you please tell the others to stop stealing my username? While you&#39;re at it Carl&#39;s been ignoring my requests for days now.

&#34;This better work,&#34; Kira mumbled, hitting send, &#34;or I&#39;m going to brain myself.&#34; Once more, she attempted to log in as she had work to do, only to once more be met with &#39;Access Denied.&#39;

Before she could smash her head into her desk, a message appeared.

I&#39;m still trying to fix your issue, but since it&#39;s taking so long, I&#39;ve moved your account to MotoK@SCiP.net. Until I figure this out, which may be a while since I think it&#39;s anomalous in nature, all your stuff will be routed there.

P.s. You didn&#39;t need to get Hyuse on my case too. I&#39;ve got enough shit on my plate being the only one working IT here.

I know you won&#39;t believe this. I know I wouldn&#39;t. But all of us are real. We&#39;ve all had the same problem with our usernames being stolen. We&#39;re not sure what&#39;s causing it yet, but it&#39;s just us Kira Motos that are affected. Feel free to message me back when you want more information. I&#39;ll send another message with a link for you when you&#39;re ready.

##D21C1C|KilerMoto:## Guys! All we have to do is change our usernames. See?

//&lt;##FF00E6|KiraMoto##, ##FF00E6|KiraMoto##, ##FF00E6|KiraMoto##, ##FF00E6|KiraMoto##, and ##FF00E6|KiraMoto## have changed nick&gt;//

##44FF88|MotoK:## Hello?

##D21C1C|KilerMoto:## Oh? You actually decided to join us.

##44FF88|MotoK:## Us? How many of us are there?

##D21C1C|KilerMoto:## Don&#39;t know for sure. There&#39;s at least 42 that have gathered here.

##D21C1C|KilerMoto:## I&#39;d imagine there&#39;d be more.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## A new one? Been a while.

##44FF88|MotoK:## Whats going on here?

##89FF00|FanonMoto:## It&#39;s a chat for all us Kiras in the Motoverse.

##AB00FF|KiraPoyo:## *sigh*

##D21C1C|KilerMoto:## Stop that Poyo.

##D21C1C|KilerMoto:## Anyway, ##44FF88|MotoK##, you work for your Foundation, right?

##44FF88|MotoK:## Yeah? I take it that most of us do. What do you want to know?

##D21C1C|KilerMoto:## Which site do you work at? We&#39;ve been figuring out what everyone does so we can see what we&#39;re working with. Most of us have answered. Though I&#39;m pretty sure a few of us aren&#39;t even in the Foundation.

##44FF88|MotoK:## I only recently joined. I was assigned to site 250 in Japan.

##89FF00|FanonMoto:## That a country? We don&#39;t have that on my Earth.

##44FF88|MotoK:## Yeah. Its a little set of islands east of the rest of Asia.

##89FF00|FanonMoto:## That&#39;s probably why. My Earth&#39;s sea level rose to the point that it&#39;s a water world. Everyone lives in underwater domes or floating cities.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## At least you have water. We&#39;re struggling to survive on this dust ball. Hell, the interstellar program is our last hope, and we&#39;re struggling to even get the fuel for that.

##AB00FF|KiraPoyo:## you havent even mastered space travel

##AB00FF|KiraPoyo:## no wonder your planets on the verge of collapse

##AB00FF|KiraPoyo:## i was assigned to the regana 4 intergalactic deep space station

##AB00FF|KiraPoyo:## we study new life in the gce 823 galaxy

##44FF88|MotoK:## GCE?

##AB00FF|KiraPoyo:## greg chudley eternal

##AB00FF|KiraPoyo:## humanities god has united us like never before

##44FF88|MotoK:## So ##D21C1C|KilerMoto## whats your home like?

##D21C1C|KilerMoto:## Pretty standard. You&#39;re normal stuff like [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/valravn-corporation-hub feasting on the battlefield], and drinking from the skulls of my enemies, but that&#39;s about all.

##44FF88|MotoK:## What.

##D21C1C|KilerMoto:## Is that not a normal thing in your universe?

##44FF88|MotoK:## No. Not at all. You sound like a mercenary group I heard once. Val-something.

##D21C1C|KilerMoto:## Valration? Yeah, that&#39;s what my universe&#39;s Foundation is called.

##44FF88|MotoK:## Well alright then.

##44FF88|MotoK:## So...

##44FF88|MotoK:## You guys got any defining characteristics?

##D21C1C|KilerMoto:## Got a scar on my neck from a bad breakup.

##AB00FF|KiraPoyo:## weird

##AB00FF|KiraPoyo:## i have one there from my little brother

##AB00FF|KiraPoyo:## he was a bit of a dick.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## I fell in the desert when I was little. Got one from being sliced open on the way down a hill.

##89FF00|FanonMoto:## I got attacked by a school of carnivorous goldfish when I was little.

##89FF00|FanonMoto:## You guys have a bad breakup when you were 17?

##44FF88|MotoK:## Yeah...

##AB00FF|KiraPoyo:## ye

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## Got the bastard thrown into the desert.

##D21C1C|KilerMoto:## He was a demon, but yes. Killed him and stole his throne. I am now next in line for leadership.

##AB00FF|KiraPoyo:## speaking of leadership

##AB00FF|KiraPoyo:## any of you know our lord and savior

##AB00FF|KiraPoyo:## greg chudley

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## The janitor at my high school?

##D21C1C|KilerMoto:## High school? He was the last Vice President. Though he and the rest of the politicians were killed a few centuries ago when the world became united under one leader.

##89FF00|FanonMoto:## Pretty sure that&#39;s the guy in charge of feeding the carnivorous goldfish. The last guy got eaten.

##44FF88|MotoK:## I think Ive heard of someone by that name. I was almost assigned to work under him but got told &#39;Im not putting you under that bumbling idiot so Im transferring you somewhere else.&#39;

##89FF00|FanonMoto:## What&#39;s the first thing you can remember? Mine is seeing the ocean with my parents.

##44FF88|MotoK:## Oddly enough mines pretty similar. We had just moved to Japan and my parents had taken me to the ocean.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## My first memory is of the only time I&#39;ve ever seen mine. I was later told they were forced to walk the desert a few hours later.

##AB00FF|KiraPoyo:## i think mine was watching my parents

##AB00FF|KiraPoyo:## they were giving themselves over to our lord

##AB00FF|KiraPoyo:## it is considered the greatest of honors to die for our lord so that he may live

##D21C1C|KilerMoto:## My house was on fire. The Valration torched our town because of heretics. I remember their expression as I was thrown from the window and landed in someone&#39;s arms.

##44FF88|MotoK:## ##D21C1C|KilerMoto## are you sure your alright? Your world sounds brutal as fuck.

##D21C1C|KilerMoto:## It&#39;s fine. Most people have gone through similar things.

##44FF88|MotoK:## Well.

##44FF88|MotoK:## Now that we know about each other I think its time to get to the more pressing matter.

##D21C1C|KilerMoto:## Agreed. We still need to figure out why this is happening.

##44FF88|MotoK:## So were here trying to figure this out? I can get on board with that.

##AB00FF|KiraPoyo:## we havent gotten very far yet

##AB00FF|KiraPoyo:## and we still don&#39;t know what caused this

##44FF88|MotoK:## Dont you have any leads?

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## No one wants to take us seriously, so we&#39;re on our own.

##89FF00|FanonMoto:## ^

##44FF88|MotoK:## Well, we have to start somewhere.

##44FF88|MotoK:## What do we have so far?

##D21C1C|KilerMoto:## Not much. Only that the first we knew of it was sometime around Halloween 2054.

##44FF88|MotoK:## So we should figure out if theres anything that any of us did in that time that wouldve caused this. We should start by examining like a month or so around Halloween then.

##44FF88|MotoK:## Did any of us encounter anything anomalous that could have caused this?

##89FF00|FanonMoto:## Nothing certain.  

##89FF00|FanonMoto:## Though ##85AFEF|KiriMoto## mentioned something about an anomaly when they first joined.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## I told you I don&#39;t know much.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## Just that I //think// I encountered something. Still not sure though.

##44FF88|MotoK:## Well what did you encounter?

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## Not sure. I was heading home and bumped into someone.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## Got a strange feeling. I tried to locate them, but couldn&#39;t.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## The problems with the logins started shortly after.

##44FF88|MotoK:## And yall havent been able to figure anything else out? What have you tried?

##AB00FF|KiraPoyo:## just about everything

##AB00FF|KiraPoyo:## weve run out of ideas

##44FF88|MotoK:## Lets give it some more thought.

##44FF88|MotoK:## I have to go but Ill be back tomorrow.

##44FF88|MotoK:## What? Why?

##D21C1C|KilerMoto:## Just do it. Something&#39;s off about them.

##FF8000|NDMoto:## Hiya!

##FF8000|NDMoto:## It looks like its just us!

##44FF88|MotoK:## Yeah.

##44FF88|MotoK:## Hey. Since were alone rn you wanna tell me why everyone avoids you?

##FF8000|NDMoto:## Whatchu mean?

##FF8000|NDMoto:## I just wanted friends. All I had was a brick, but then it wasn&#39;t a brick anymore.

##44FF88|MotoK:## Oh? You just want friends? What&#39;s this about a brick?

##FF8000|NDMoto:## Yeah!

##FF8000|NDMoto:## I&#39;m all alone here! And I don&#39;t wanna be! I was holding my brick and I really wanted friends and then it became this thing.

##44FF88|MotoK:## Youre alone? Do you not have a job? Or friends?

##FF8000|NDMoto:## No

##FF8000|NDMoto:## I&#39;m still little so I&#39;m not allowed to leave this room.

##FF8000|NDMoto:## Wait, I need a minute.

##44FF88|MotoK:## ?

##FF8000|NDMoto:## Sorry. My dad came to yell at me again.

##FF8000|NDMoto:## He gets like that a lot so I&#39;m used to it.

##44FF88|MotoK:## What

##44FF88|MotoK:## Wait how old are you?

##FF8000|NDMoto:## I&#39;m not sure. 10?

##44FF88|MotoK:## Then howd you end up in here?

##FF8000|NDMoto:## What you mean?

##FF8000|NDMoto:## I was the first one. Everyone else came later.

##44FF88|MotoK:## So you were here all alone until the rest of us showed up?

##44FF88|MotoK:## That must have been lonely.

##FF8000|NDMoto:## Thats aight. Cause now I have friends.

##FF8000|NDMoto:## Theyre coming again, I have to go.

##FF8000|NDMoto:## Thanks for talking with me.

##FF8000|NDMoto:## ##44FF88|MotoK##, youre here, right?
 
##44FF88|MotoK:## Whats up?

##FF8000|NDMoto:## Youre not going to leave me alone like the others, right?

##FF8000|NDMoto:## They think im weird and don&#39;t like me.

##44FF88|MotoK:## Im more interested in how this all happened.

##44FF88|MotoK:## You said you were the first one yeah? Do you have any idea how all this started?

##FF8000|NDMoto:## no?

##FF8000|NDMoto:## Its always just been me here. I wanted someone to talk to, and it just happened one day.

##44FF88|MotoK:## It just happened? How?

##FF8000|NDMoto:## I dunno

##FF8000|NDMoto:## I was just alone and wished for friends. Then the brick thing happened and I was able to talk to people!

##44FF88|MotoK:## Ive been wondering this for a while...

##44FF88|MotoK:## But why are you alone?

##44FF88|MotoK:## ##FF8000|NDMoto##?

##FF8000|NDMoto:## hmm? Sorry. My parents came back, I had to hide this.

##FF8000|NDMoto:## My parents dont let me leave the basement. Im not allowed to go out.

##FF8000|NDMoto:## They dont come down here much. Just make sure I&#39;m still here and breathing and to feed me.

##44FF88|MotoK:## Im sorry but wtf. Your parents are awful people.

##FF8000|NDMoto:## Are they? I thought this was normal.

##44FF88|MotoK:## Dude. This is the furthest thing possible from normal. This isnt even alright.

##44FF88|MotoK:## GUYS!

##89FF00|FanonMoto:## ?

##44FF88|MotoK:## We have to start looking for a way to get to ##FF8000|NDMoto##. I just learned the kids being neglected.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## Is that our problem? I thought we were trying to figure out this whole anomaly.

##44FF88|MotoK:## Thats just it.

##44FF88|MotoK:## Nd is the anomaly.

##44FF88|MotoK:## Their shitty parents being shitty parents is the reason were all connected.

##D21C1C|KilerMoto:## So you want to test the theory that taking ND out of their home will disconnect us? That&#39;s further than we got.  

##AB00FF|KiraPoyo:## i dont see that we have anything to lose. what do you think ##89FF00|fanonmoto##

##89FF00|FanonMoto:## I might be able to get some help with this through my site director. You guys should try as well, though I don&#39;t think this is that bad to be a part of.

##FF8000|NDMoto:## :D

##FF8000|NDMoto:## Friends?

##44FF88|MotoK:## Yes Nd. Friends.

I&#39;ve figured out the problem. There&#39;s an anomaly in play here that&#39;s affecting me and every other me out there. I would like to put in a request for resources to get to the bottom of this.

After looking over your proposal, I have to deny it. We don&#39;t have the resources here to even begin an expedition like this. As much as I understand your wish to help, there&#39;s no feasible way we can do it here.

##44FF88|MotoK:## Anyone have anything yet? My site director shot my idea down...

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## I was able to get some help. We&#39;ve got MTF here who go into other universes to gather resources.

##44FF88|MotoK:## How are we going to use them to help ND?

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## I... Had a thought about that. ND&#39;s not in a good place right now. Assuming there&#39;s a Foundation in their universe, wouldn&#39;t it be better to take them there? Mine&#39;s focused on leaving the planet, but we weren&#39;t always like that. If ND&#39;s is concerned with securing anomalies, they&#39;d be safe there.

##89FF00|FanonMoto:## You want to turn the kid over? What if their Foundation&#39;s worse than their parents? Besides that, how do you think we&#39;d even get them out of the house?

##AB00FF|KiraPoyo:## dont you think its worth trying tho

##AB00FF|KiraPoyo:## nd deserves help even if its hard

##44FF88|MotoK:## I think its worth that chance. Nd doesnt deserve to suffer like this when we can do something to help.

##44FF88|MotoK:## Do you think you could get them in to confirm the Foundation&#39;s presence there?

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## I can try. Though I&#39;m almost certain I&#39;m going to get in trouble for this. Resources are tight, and they&#39;ll be sure to notice the moment the MTF leaves. My life will probably be over when I&#39;m caught.

##AB00FF|KiraPoyo:## you sure you want to do this then

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## I&#39;ve already decided. As much as my earth needs me, I&#39;m leaving with the MTF. If I stay behind, I&#39;ll be sent to walk the desert as punishment for wasting what resources we have.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## If there is a Foundation in ND&#39;s universe, I&#39;m going to join them. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be able to help, no matter what they&#39;re like.

##44FF88|MotoK:## If youre sure about this.

##44FF88|MotoK:## Keep us updated aight?

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## Will do.

[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## Going through now. You guys locate ND&#39;s place yet?

##D21C1C|KilerMoto:## ##44FF88|MotoK##&#39;s working on it. She&#39;ll tell us when she&#39;s got it.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## Alright, we&#39;ve made it over. There&#39;s... So much life here.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## Are these... Trees?

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## Gods, there&#39;s so much here. It&#39;s almost unbelievable.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## Sorry. We&#39;re on our way now. I hear sirens, so someone&#39;s coming for us.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## Guys, we&#39;re surrounded. These look like they could be Foundation staff, but they&#39;re acting weird. I think it&#39;s because I&#39;m messaging you.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## Shit. They&#39;re tsaskj f

##D21C1C|KilerMoto:## ##85AFEF|KiriMoto##?

##D21C1C|KilerMoto:## Hopefully they&#39;ll be alright.

##44FF88|MotoK:## Guys! I managed to locate ##FF8000|Ndmoto##!  

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## I convinced them to give me my phone back. The team and I are on the move.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## It looks like we&#39;re getting close. I hear shouting.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## We&#39;re at the door now. There&#39;s shouting, and things are getting thrown.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## It just went silent.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## We entered. This place is a dump. Everything&#39;s frozen in place. Things are just floating in the air.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## Wait, I think I hear sobbing.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## Just opened a door to be met with a man with a shotgun. Looks furious.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## There&#39;s a woman here holding a knife. She looks like she was heading somewhere.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## That sobbing&#39;s louder now. There&#39;s blood on the floor. Gods, I hope it&#39;s not ND.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## There&#39;s a broken phone on the ground. It&#39;s stuck on my message from a few hours ago. Shit, this is definitely ND then.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## The sobs stopped. I think we&#39;re close.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## Opened another door. There&#39;s blood everywhere. I can hear whimpers now. They&#39;re coming from a closet.  

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## Guys... I found him... He&#39;s... Not doing well.

[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

##44FF88|MotoK:## Kiri hasnt checked in for hours. How do you think theyre doing?

##89FF00|FanonMoto:## I hate this waiting, it&#39;s killing me.  

##AB00FF|KiraPoyo:## we just have to be patient

##AB00FF|KiraPoyo:## ##85AFEF|kirimoto## will tell us when she has something to report

##89FF00|FanonMoto:## Doesn&#39;t mean it sucks any less though.

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## Guys...

##44FF88|MotoK:## Oh no...

##89FF00|FanonMoto:## What is it?

&gt;##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## It&#39;s ND.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## He&#39;s going to be fine.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## Also he&#39;s my son now.  

##44FF88|MotoK:## Asshole. Dont scare us like that.

##89FF00|FanonMoto:## How&#39;d it go with that Foundation?

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## Oh yeah! I got a job considering my experience in my home universe. My primary assignment&#39;s going to be the newest skip in their databanks.

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## Apparently they see value in having the one person a reality bender trusts being the one to watch them.

##44FF88|MotoK:## The kids a reality bender? With what specifically?

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## From early examination, it seems he can control the space around him as he wishes, though he&#39;s still unable to do it on command. I don&#39;t think he fully knows he&#39;s even doing it. I think he was able to contact all of us because he was focusing his anomaly on just one spot, instead of everything around him.

##44FF88|MotoK:## Kids crazy dangerous if thats true. You sure you&#39;ll be able to handle him?

##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## Not really, but the two of us will stick together, so I&#39;ll keep an eye on him. Besides, there&#39;s always you guys if I need help.

##D21C1C|KilerMoto:## Well, good luck then. I&#39;m glad for both of you. Just make sure to keep us updated.

 ##85AFEF|KiriMoto:## We will.
