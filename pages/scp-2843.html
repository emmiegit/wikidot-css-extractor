**Item #:** SCP-2843

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The Foundation has at this point successfully fabricated an in-effect EAB quarantine [[footnote]] EAB quarantine is a strategy used to isolate infestations of the emerald ash borer (//Agrilus planipennis//) in various regions of North America.  As its name induces, this species of insect is known for exclusively attacking //Fraxinus americana// (the ash tree).  They are also known for spreading their colonies by hiding within branches and logs used for firewood.  As such, areas under EAB quarantine remain off limits to civilians by law. [[/footnote]] for the area housing SCP-2843, thus establishing legal mandatory isolation.  Additional security is provided through surveillance camera monitoring along with a perimeter gate.  Testing of SCP-2843 requires the presence of at least 3 cleared personnel who will maintain a minimum distance of 15 meters between them and SCP-2843-1 at all times.  Test subjects entering SCP-2843 are to be equipped with a two way radio --and optional mounted camcorder for communicative purposes--.  Subjects exiting SCP-2843 unimpaired at the end of the test may be escorted out and debriefed as soon as possible.  Individuals displaying side effects of dysmetropsia after reemergence must be allowed to rest for several minutes prior to questioning.  Those unable to emerge from SCP-2843 are not to be pursued.

**Description:** SCP-2843 refers to a spatial anomaly currently affecting the unearthed portion of a fallen white ash tree (//Fraxinus americana//), designated SCP-2843-1.  Patches of moss, roots, soil and small rocks are clearly visible over most of the lower trunk of the tree, though the original cause of its collapse is unknown at this point.  Repeated testing reveals that entry into SCP-2843 occurs while within approximately 5 meters of SCP-2843-1.  Effects will usually materialize after 8-10 forward steps are taken.  Access seems to be possible from any direction when adhering to these criteria.  Test subjects walking crookedly or attempting to enter SCP-2843 outside of this active zone will inevitably fail the experiment.  Knowledge of said conditions also acts to prevent unwarranted entry into SCP-2843 during travel to and from the examination area.

Test subjects entering SCP-2843 are soon affected by rapid changes to their visual orientation.  Growth in SCP-2843-1’s size and placement on the horizon becomes initially noticeable and steadily intensifies.  Further visual distortion occurs upon arriving at SCP-2843-1, wherein previously small-scale features of the fallen tree, such as dislodged roots and embedded rocks, take on gigantic proportions.  Moss covered areas of SCP-2843-1 may emulate the appearance and texture of grass or similar topography beneath the test subject’s feet.  Furthermore, the uprooted base of the tree exhibits a heightened gradient, described during several debriefings as “a very steep hill” or “tall mountain”.  From the standpoint of outside observers, however, the test subject appears to gradually decrease in size as they approach SCP-2843-1, ultimately disappearing from sight and remaining unseen until the conclusion of the experiment. [[footnote]] Researchers have concluded that the alleged ‘shrinking’ of test subjects is caused by a rapid transition from normal space to the dimensions contained within SCP-2843.  In a visual sense, this ultimately results in a form of short-range 3-point perspective. [[/footnote]]

The length of time sustained within SCP-2843 has varied with each test subject.  Individuals exiting the space will usually reappear on the opposite side of SCP-2843-1, concurrently exhibiting ‘growth’ to their normal stature.  Feelings of dizziness, exhaustion, migraine headaches or difficulty with depth perception most often affect subjects upon reemergence, requiring on-duty personnel to help them walk or balance.  However, most of these effects have proven temporary, usually dissipating in under an hour.

SCP-2843 came to the attention of the Foundation soon after news reports had confirmed the unusual disappearances of 3 residents in northeastern ███ ██████, USA.  Missing person reports had been filed for a local hiker, a 15 year old teenager, and an 8 year old child over the course of 2 weeks.  Subsequent to these reports being publicized, search parties located each victim within 48 hours of dispatch.  In every case, the missing individual was found lying unconscious near SCP-2843-1.   Upon medical examination, victims displayed corresponding symptoms of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome (AIWS), most of which subsided over the course of their treatment.  Two of the three victims had otherwise sustained mostly minor injuries, but the third appeared to have suffered a considerably large bite on the right leg.  Though all three individuals were able to recount vague descriptions of the ‘landscape’ when questioned, none proved capable of remembering when, why or how long they had been missing, nor could the victim of the bite recall the source of their injury.  Foundation personnel deemed it necessary to administer mild amnestics to the victims as well as all involved parties prior to containment of SCP-2843.

**Addendum 2843-A**

&gt; //**Segment of a note from Dr. Galvez regarding the bite victim**//
&gt; 
&gt; Closer inspection of the marks on the patient’s leg has revealed uncanny similarities to large-scale insect mandibles…I need not mention the importance of omitting this detail from all external medical records.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Test 2843-1&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]

__Participant__: D-3287, female, age 29
 
This is the first test performed with SCP-2843 subsequent to containment.  Doctors ask subject D-3287 to interact freely with SCP-2843-1.

&gt; __//Log begins at 9:04 A.M., 5/18/██//__
&gt; 
&gt; //[D-3287 is seen walking along the trunk of SCP-2843-1, jumping off halfway across.  Subject then begins to meander along the sides of the tree.]//
&gt; 
&gt; D-3287: I really don’t see any point to this, doc.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Subject continues to walks around all different sides of SCP-2843-1 for several more minutes, resulting in equal inactivity.  D-3287 then begins to walk back towards the doctors in a slow, laid back manner.]//
&gt; 
&gt; D-3287: I think we’re done here, don’t you?
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Ferdinand: We ask that you please continue your interaction, D-3287, or we’ll have to consider this experiment a failure.
&gt; 
&gt; //[D-3287 rolls her eyes at the doctors before turning back towards SCP-2843-1.  Subject walks straight towards it.]//
&gt; 
&gt; D-3287: //(while walking)// Got to be honest here, doc.  I think that ship has…
&gt; 
&gt; //[D-3287 begins to show signs of disorientation.]//
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Ferdinand: //(to D-3287)// Are you alright?
&gt; 
&gt; //[D-3287 stumbles back several steps and suddenly collapses, at which point the two doctors rush over to her, dragging her back several meters.  D-3287 comes to after about 8 minutes, mentioning that everything in front of her started “growing in size” before she fainted.  Subject is removed from the experiment after complaining of a bad migraine headache.]//

&gt; //**Note from Dr. Ferdinand to Dr. Galvez**//
&gt; 
&gt; It would seem that we have isolated a way to engage SCP-2843, though further testing is required to confirm my hypothesis.  I request use of both audio and video communication for future experiments.
&gt; 
&gt; -//Dr. Ferdinand//
&gt; 
&gt; //**Reply from Dr. Galvez**//
&gt; 
&gt; Your request is granted.  Please provide me with a copy of your video findings as soon as possible.
&gt; 
&gt; -//Dr. Galvez//

__Participant__: D-2941, male, 43 years old

D-2941 is equipped with a two-way radio and helmet-mounted camcorder prior to experimentation.  Subject is stationed a short distance from SCP-2843-1 while three personnel stand by, observing from multiple angles.

&gt; __Log begins at 8:46 A.M., 5/26/██__
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Ferdinand: D-2941, is your helmet cam recording?
&gt; 
&gt; D-2941: Yeah, it’s on.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Ferdinand: All right, you may proceed towards the tree.  Remember to immediately inform me if you see anything strange during your approach, understand?
&gt; 
&gt; D-2941: I got it, I got it.
&gt; 
&gt; //[D-2941 begins to walk directly towards SCP-2943-1.  Approximately 19 steps into his approach, personnel begin to notice D-2941 shrinking in size.]//
&gt; 
&gt; D-2941: Whoa, doc…I…I’m not feeling quite right here.  Why is everything…?
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Ferdinand: D-2941, please continue your approach forward.  Do not deviate.  //(To Dr. Peterson)//  Make a note; subject was between 5 and 6 meters from SCP-2843-1 before exhibiting effects.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Peterson: Noted.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Static can be heard forming over the walkie.]//
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Ferdinand: D-2941, come in.  Can you hear me?
&gt; 
&gt; //[Static continues.  D-2941 continues to recede until out of view.]//
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Ferdinand: Come in, D-2941.  We can no longer see you, what is your current position?
&gt; 
&gt; //[Several more minutes of static occur, after which D-2941 can again be heard.]//
&gt; 
&gt; D-2941: I’m still here, doc.  Holy hell, why is everything suddenly so damn…huge…
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Ferdinand: What do you see in front of you?  Please be specific.
&gt; 
&gt; D-2941: Looks like a big hill.  There are boulders and dead trees everywhere, loads of them.  I’m standing on some kind of soggy grass too.  Can anyone tell me what the hell is going on?
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Ferdinand: D-2941, from what you’re describing, it would seem your current task would be to climb the hill to the opposite side.  Be advised that we will be standing by on the other side to assist you.
&gt; 
&gt; D-2941: //(sighing heavily)// …Great.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Personnel hear D-2941 grunting and panting for the next 18 minutes, tripping and stumbling several times as he walks.]//
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Ferdinand: D-2941, are you doing okay?
&gt; 
&gt; D-2941: //(grunting)// Just dandy, doc.  I’m about half way down the other side.  It might just be me, but do any of you hear…
&gt; 
&gt; //[Static again begins to form over the radio.  Several minutes pass before Dr. Peterson, who is stationed on the opposite side of SCP-2843-1, notices D-2941 beginning to reemerge.  D-2941 gradually returns to normal size, noticeably exhausted and losing balance.]//
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Peterson: Subject spotted, beginning forward approach to assist.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Ferdinand: Proceed. //(Motions to the third researcher present to assist Dr. Peterson.)//
&gt; 
&gt; //[D-2941 is escorted away from SCP-2843-1 and seated on a nearby tree stump.  Subject is conclusively diagnosed with post-experimental macropsia.  Symptoms subside after approximately 38 minutes of rest.  During subsequent debriefing, subject recalls hearing a “shrill noise” in the distance during the latter half of the experiment.  All 3 researchers who were present do not recall hearing anything over the radio at the time.]//

&gt; //Review of the footage taken by D-2941’s helmet camera shows the tape cutting in and out during the subject’s approach.  The video then restarts for 2 or 3 seconds while D-2941 is inside SCP-2843, after which it cuts out for the remainder of the experiment.  This manages to briefly capture SCP-2843-1’s immense size while inside SCP-2843.//

&gt; 

&gt; //**Note from Dr. Ferdinand to Dr. Galvez**//
&gt; 
&gt; I have enclosed the test footage from our second experiment for your consideration.  I apologize in advance for the choppiness of the video feed.  Though visual communication seems impractical within the anomaly, we have had little trouble with walkie-talkies aside from occasional static.  However, I think even this brief clip is more than enough evidence to clearly identify SCP-2843 as a dimensional irregularity.  Our test subject’s description of what he saw points to some kind of high-altitude miniature landscape.  Aside from radio communication, I also ask that we provide the next test subject with an audio recording device.  According to our previous participant, something else appears to be existing within SCP-2843.
&gt; 
&gt; -//Dr. Ferdinand//
&gt; 
&gt; //**Reply from Dr. Galvez**//
&gt; 
&gt; Well done.  I will not require the use of camcorders during experimentation.  Two way radios, however, will continue to be used on both sides.  Your request for a sound recording device is also approved.  Keep me posted on any more new findings.
&gt; 
&gt; -//Dr. Galvez//

__Participant__: D-2282, female, age 40

Subject is provided with a two-way radio.  Attached to her breast pocket is a high-sensitivity microphone connected to a recording transceiver monitored by Dr. Ferdinand.  Instructions are given to the subject regarding entering SCP-2843.  The subject obeys, exhibiting the inevitable shrinking and vanishing.

&gt; __Log begins at 4:06 P.M., 6/7/██__
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Ferdinand: Audio is coming in loud and clear, D-2282.  Inform me immediately of any strange activity.
&gt; 
&gt; D-2282: I really don’t give a rat’s ass what the audio sounds like, doc.  You better start explaining why everything around me is so damn massive!  I swear these leaves on the ground are as big as mini vans.  And is that a…good God, what is happening?
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Ferdinand: All part of the experiment, D-2282.  Once you climb the hill and make it out the other side, we can escort you out.  Do you think you can do that?
&gt; 
&gt; D-2282: //(groans)// I’m getting too old for this…
&gt; 
&gt; //[The usual static intervals occur.  Subject goes silent for several minutes.]//
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Ferdinand: D-2282, are you alright?
&gt; 
&gt; //[Subject does not respond for a full 45 minutes.  Continuous panting and climbing are heard throughout.  Static intervals continue to occur.]//
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Ferdinand: Come in, D-2282.  I must insist that you respond.
&gt; 
&gt; D-2282: Would you shut up already, I’m here! //(panting)// I’m finally at the top of this freaking hill, so how about we hurry up and…
&gt; 
&gt; //[A sudden eruption of shrill stridulations occur, gradually growing louder and more aggressive.]//
&gt; 
&gt; D-2282: Uh, doc…what in the hell is that?
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Ferdinand: D-2282, please remain where you are and describe to me what you see.
&gt; 
&gt; D-2282: What, are you out of your mind?!  Stand here and wait for whatever the hell that is to show up?!  Screw that, screw that so hard!  I’m coming down right now!!
&gt; 
&gt; //[The cacophonous sound is now compounded by the sound of multiple crawling legs.]//
&gt; 
&gt; D-2282: //(screaming and panting)// Mother of God, what is that?!  It’s right behind me!!
&gt; 
&gt; //[D-2282 suddenly shrieks and can be heard dropping the radio.  The noise continues to grow louder and louder until the transmission cuts off.  Dr. Ferdinand stands motionless for several minutes before stopping the recording and ending the experiment.]//

&gt; //**Note from Dr. Ferdinand to Dr. Galvez**//
&gt; 
&gt; Repeated listening with several specialists best identifies the noise in the recording as a mutated stridulation of the ████ ███, genus ██████████.  I will send the files to you for consideration as promised.  However, I am putting a hiatus on field testing with SCP-2843-1 into effect until further notice.
&gt; 
&gt; -//Dr. Ferdinand//

**Addendum 2843-B**

On June 15, 20██, personnel monitoring SCP-2843’s perimeter spotted a strange occurrence involving Dr. Ferdinand.  Directly before exiting the perimeter gate, file footage shows Ferdinand stumbling backwards several meters and falling to the ground.  The doctor is then seen fleeing in another direction, purposely circumventing the area.

&gt; //**Segment of Dr. Ferdinand’s explanation**//
&gt; 
&gt; My plan was to simply take a few file photos of SCP-2843-1 before we end all interaction.  But as I walked towards the gate to leave, it started to grow larger and larger.  I felt completely disoriented, but knew exactly what was happening.  Admittedly, this has always been in the back of my mind ever since beginning to study this anomaly.  For all we know now, there could be dozens more instances of SCP-2843 out there, waiting to be infiltrated in just the right way…
&gt; 
&gt; -//Dr. Ferdinand//

&gt; //**Note from Dr. Galvez to all researchers**//
&gt; 
&gt; Subsequent to Dr. Ferdinand’s debriefing, this particular section of fence has been isolated and designated SCP-2843-2.  Proposals for making study of SCP-2843 strictly surveillance-based from this point on are under consideration.
&gt;
