**Item #:** SCP-4785

**Object Class:** Memetic

**Containment Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Unfortunately, SCP-4785 is not able to be contained. However, SCP-4785 seems to be limited to Site-31. I will take any action necessary to keep it there.

Some notes:

* Look like you&#39;re doing work, whatever&#39;s happening, they can&#39;t tell between me doing actual documentation and me writing Lorem Ipsum into Word. I&#39;ve used trial and error to figure out that 2 hours of work to 1 hour of investigation is usually a good ratio.
* Security camera in Hall C3 is broken. There&#39;s a pretty accessible vent there that connects with Break Room 3. Use it if you don&#39;t want them to get footage of you sneaking around.
* Try to avoid conversation about SCPs, just keep it pedestrian. Just spew some shit about the Dodgers, it&#39;s not like they&#39;ll correct you.
* Whatever you do, don&#39;t let them see you getting into Break Room 3.

**Description:** SCP-4785 is the phenomenon that has affected all personnel at Site-31. For reasons unknown, the only person unaffected by SCP-4785 is me.

SCP-4785 causes slurred speech, slowing of thought, loss of memory, loss of intelligence, loss of personality, and other potential symptoms that I do not know of yet. This phenomena appears to be centered around Break Room 3, as they become uneasy when I bring it up, and defend it with some level of hostility.

**Addendum 01:** My name is Researcher Jacob R. Dylan. I&#39;ve been working with the Foundation for eight years, and I&#39;ve been stationed at Site-31 for two. My clearance level is 2/3662.

I first noticed something was up when I arrived at work and everybody was moving around like the life was drained out of them. It&#39;s an office environment, but this was a new level of foot-dragging. Whenever I tried to talk to somebody, they either just shrugged it off or grunted in response.

Later that day, I went to the break room to get some coffee. Dr. Jameston tells me that I can&#39;t go into the break room. I ask him why. He just stares me down. When I try to get past him, he pulls a knife, so I defuse the situation, telling him that I&#39;ll go to Break Room 2. He puts down the knife, and I walk away.

Now they&#39;ve done a site lockdown out of nowhere. Nothing&#39;s going in, nothing&#39;s going out, not even information. The cognitohazard locks are on as well.

I&#39;m gonna try to investigate whatever&#39;s happening here. I opened up this file to store whatever I find out in this, and I&#39;ve locked it under &#34;potential memetic contagion&#34; so I should be the only one who can get in. Unless Director George or RAISA decides to audit the file, I should be safe.

I have a tape recorder that I brought to do interviews with the people who got stuck inside of [[[SCP-3662]]] a while back. I&#39;ll find it and try to give an example of these people.

&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** //&lt;Whispering.&gt;// Testing, testing... good, looks like it&#39;s working. Alright, uh, begin interview log.
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Rustling sound, presumably from audio recorder being placed into Researcher Dylan&#39;s coat pocket. Researcher Dylan then approaches another researcher, presumably Dr. Tragall due to corresponding security camera footage.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** Hey there! How&#39;s your day going?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tragall:** My day is proceeding along well. I have contained several SCP objects today.
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;It is of note that Dr. Tragall speaks in an unusually monotone voice.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** Great to hear. So, have you noticed anything... different around here, recently? Feels like there&#39;s... something in the air, you know?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tragall:** No.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** Hah. Uh, you said you were containing SCPs? What did you do to contain them?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tragall:** That&#39;s classified.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** Oh, ok. Anyways, I&#39;m gonna head off to Break Room 3 and enjoy—
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tragall:** //&lt;Interrupting.&gt;// You cannot enter Break Room 3.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** Oh, why not? Isn&#39;t it—
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tragall:** It is classified.
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Dr. Tragall speaks with a more agitated tone than before.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** Alright, then. Thanks for talking with me.

**Addendum 03:** I showed the tape from above to TSAT, the site AIC. He&#39;s convinced that there&#39;s something going on, and he&#39;s going to help me.

There&#39;s a way to get into Break Room 3. In Hall C3, there&#39;s a broken security camera next to a vent that I could crawl through to the room. I think I might be able to get in there, I&#39;m slim enough.

I don&#39;t know why they keep going inside Break Room 3 or why I&#39;m not allowed in, but I intend to find out.

**Addendum 04:** This goes a lot deeper than I thought.

I crawled through the vent, and the minute I stepped in I felt something was //off//. You know that feeling you get when you see a picture of some abandoned cult house, or watch a movie and feel the creeps even though nothing was happening? It was sort of like that.

Nothing looked out of the ordinary, though. Just the old break room that I remember. Then, I heard a humming coming out of one of the lower cabinets, under one of the tables. Like something was vibrating. I opened it up, and there was a black void in the cabinet. Not a metaphor, just a blackness inside the cabinet, like a curtain.

I stuck my hand in, and it felt chilly, like ice water. So I crawled into the cabinet, straight into the blackness. It was completely dark on the inside, and I was able to stand up. The floor was covered with some kind of slime that smelled like battery acid. I walked until I felt a metal wall on the other side of the room. I walked along the wall, around the room. That place has got to be at least 20 feet by 20 feet. I jumped, but I couldn&#39;t reach the ceiling.

Eventually, I found the hole where I came from, and crawled back out of the cabinet. I didn&#39;t investigate further; I didn&#39;t have a light, and I didn&#39;t want to be caught by SCP-4785.

I can&#39;t get an MTF to explore the cabinet, so I guess I&#39;ll do it myself. They all still sleep in the site dormitories; I can hide in the vent before that happens, and then get into the cabinet. I have a flashlight, and TSAT helped me get ahold of one of the fancy computerized audio recorders, the kind that the MTFs use, so I&#39;ll bring that in to make sure I capture everything.

If I don&#39;t record in this file again, I died inside of the cabinet. Wish me luck.
