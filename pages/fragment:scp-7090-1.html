**Item #:** SCP-7090

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7090-A is to be housed according to standard protocols for potentially radioactive humanoids. Periodic medical examination is permitted for the purpose of data collection.

At this time, SCP-7090-B is effectively contained-in-place, subject to monitoring.

**Description:** SCP-7090-A is a 27 year old human female whose cranial cavity acts as a wormhole to the area around Sol, the star at the center of our planetary system. More background on SCP-7090-A&#39;s discovery and on initial experimental results can be found in the Level 3 version of this file.

Information concerning SCP-7090-B is restricted Level 5 and Level 4/7090 **only.**[[footnote]]Current list of 4/7090 clearance holders:

++++ Experimental process (continued from L3 file)
@@ @@

After previous experiments had concentrated on the skull/space boundary (see [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7090/offset/0|Level 3 file]]]), further experiments were conducted to ascertain the nature and, if any, location of SCP-7090-A&#39;s brain.

An initial hypothesis involved calculating the exact geometric center of SCP-7090-A&#39;s skull and mapping that to an Inner Solar System location. If the properties SCP-7090-A&#39;s skull had on surgical probes had also manifested internally, and the brain had somehow survived this process, it was theorized that SCP-7090-A&#39;s brain would be found at the calculated coordinates.

Initial attempts to examine this location were hindered by solar flares and other regular solar activity spikes. This led to significant increases in sensor refinement, in particular to cancel out the effect of the solar background. However, regardless of the amount of electromagnetic noise removed from the signal background, SCP-7090&#39;s brain could not be located in the calculated region of space.

Several further proposals to determine the status and/or location of SCP-7090-A&#39;s brain were put forward over the course of the next several months. A summary of these proposals and their associated outcomes can be found below.

: **Proposal 7090-B-1: Brain still in skull cavity.** : //Analysis was performed on readings taken during previous experiments on SCP-7090-A, as well as some new readings from a surgery session arranged for this specific purpose. The presence of a biological brain sharing the skull with the wormhole could not be directly determined. The neural tissues in the spinal column appeared to cleanly terminate at the base of the skull with no apparent effect on neurological processes.//
@@ @@
: **Proposal 7090-B-2: Brain does not exist.** : //With SCP-7090&#39;s consent, testing was performed to measure and determine electrical signals in the upper spinal column in response to various forms of movement and stimuli. The electrical responses observed were consistent with those when a brain is present. In particular, the signals for movement were observed to originate at the apparent terminus of the upper spinal column in a manner suggesting transmission from a brain that would normally be directly connected. Overall, evidence suggested strongly the existence of a functioning biological brain, although location remained unknown.//

{{I am running out of options. But I have one last thing to try.}}
[[/div]]

As a last resort, Dr Aluko requested another analysis crawler run -- which would draw from her general department budget and did not require approval -- over all datasets transmitted during the near-solar examinations, in order to discern any subtler patterns that may have been overlooked.

At first, as in the previous analyses, no pertinent data could be found. However, Dr. Aluko had required the crawler to run over all collected datasets, not just those flagged for the area of interest. When the crawler moved onto wide-area datasets captured far away from the Sun, the possible presence of extremely faint but systematic electron activity was flagged from multiple sources.

After reconstruction and combination of data from all available sources was performed, a unique pattern of background electrical activity began to emerge.

{{(Excerpt begins)}}

**ALUKO:**  Dania! Thank you for coming.

**SCP-7090-A:** Hi, Dr Aluko. How are you?

**ALUKO:** I&#39;m doing great - and you&#39;re about to be, too, maybe.

//(Short pause)//

**SCP-7090-A:** Why?

**ALUKO:** Well. First of all, I had to call in a couple favors, but the upshot is: there aren&#39;t going to be any more surgeries. At least, for a long time. You&#39;re done with those.

**SCP-7090-A:** Really? Oh, that&#39;s... good. Thank you.

**ALUKO:** You&#39;re welcome! But there&#39;s something else. So, uh... did you ever see that old movie, the Wizard of Oz? Or read the books?

**SCP-7090-A:** Huh. I saw the movie when I was really little, I think. No, I did. Tin man, the lion, the ruby slippers and all, right?

**ALUKO:** Exactly! So, guess what...

//(Short pause)//

**ALUKO:** ...Ms. Scarecrow?

//(No audio for several seconds)//

**SCP-7090-A:** //Oh my God.//

**ALUKO:** We found it.

//(No audio for several seconds)//

**SCP-7090-A:** //(sobbing)//

**ALUKO:** Hey, it&#39;s okay... it&#39;s okay. I know this is a lot.

**SCP-7090-A:** No, it&#39;s just... I&#39;m just... I didn&#39;t think..

//(Short pause)//

**SCP-7090-A:** I didn&#39;t think I had one. I didn&#39;t //mind// if it was weird! I just wanted to have one. And, like. Even though it&#39;s probably... in some, like, weird-ass magic jar or something, //(laughs)// I still fucking have one. I&#39;m still, like... a //person.//

**ALUKO:** So... do you //want// to know anything else? You want me to stop here?

**SCP-7090-A:** Hell no! //(laughs)// Lay it on me. We&#39;ve come this far, Dr A. I wanna //know.//

**ALUKO:** So, you know you just said you imagined it in a jar somewhere?

**SCP-7090-A:** Yeah?

**ALUKO:** Well... how big of a jar do you think you can imagine?

**Description, continued:** SCP-7090-B refers to SCP-7090-A&#39;s brain, which occupies the entirety of an ellipsoid region of space bounded by the orbit of Mercury.

It is theorized SCP-7090-B has been in place for the entire of SCP-7090-A&#39;s lifetime, despite remaining undetected by both Foundation and civilian astronomers. This was due to the fact that a human brain scaled to this vast extent has a density considerably lower than that of intergalactic space.[[footnote]]approx one atom per 300,000 cubic meters, vs. approx one atom per cubic meter.[[/footnote]] SCP-7090-B only became detectable after Foundation sensor upgrades allowed the Sun&#39;s electromagnetic background noise to be almost completely canceled out. The mechanisms by which SCP-7090-B can still function despite its extraordinarily low density, gigantic size, and physical separation from SCP-7090-A are as yet unclear.

It is further theorized that spikes in solar activity - corresponding approximately to the theorized location of SCP-7090-A&#39;s thalamus - cause SCP-7090-A&#39;s intermittent mild stroke symptoms. This allows Foundation astronomical and medical staff to have a measure of warning of the onset of these symptoms, and for SCP-7090-A&#39;s condition to be managed appropriately.
