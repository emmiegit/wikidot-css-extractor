**Item #:** SCP-5825

**Object Class:** Decommissioned

**Special Containment Procedures:** As normalcy has been completely redefined by occurrences documented in earlier iterations of this article, the need to protect it has faded away. There is no need for SCP-5825 anymore.

**Description:** SCP-5825 is the SCP Foundation. Well, not really. But for all intents and purposes, it is.

I started this document years ago. Decades ago, maybe even centuries. It might&#39;ve even been when we were still around. I was very much in denial about what I was, what had happened, all of it. I was trying to find the solution to it. But I&#39;m not sure the solution exists. Even if it does, it doesn&#39;t really matter. This document was an event, and a phenomenon, myself for a time I think. I&#39;m not even sure what it was originally anymore.

It no longer makes sense to document this. The more I think about it, the more I wonder if it ever truly made sense. Most of what I wrote happened after, and I think I was just trying to keep some sense of normalcy. But I don&#39;t need that anymore.

The Foundation is gone. It&#39;s been gone for a very long time. We had a good run, didn’t we? We did good work, we saved lives, helped people, kept the peace. But we don&#39;t need to do that anymore. Honestly, there&#39;s not really even a &#34;we&#34; anymore. There are others out there who remember, I&#39;m sure of it, but they don&#39;t uphold these values anymore. And frankly, neither do I. I haven&#39;t for a long time.

I honestly don&#39;t know why I came back. Nostalgia, I guess. Back to the place where it all started. The new world. The new understanding of myself. The shift. I guess I wanted to see the ocean as that big, mysterious beast I once knew it as, feel the sea mist on my face, and remember what I was like before. I miss who I was before. But I&#39;m happy for who I am now. I hear the waves crashing on the shore even as I type this, old yet new. And I am at peace. I want to revisit the woman I was before, knowing what I know now, and see the world as she used to see it, just for a moment. Remember how far I&#39;ve come.

And when I&#39;m done, I&#39;m going to sit on the shore and rest. I&#39;m tired of tragedy. I just want to watch the waves go in and out.
