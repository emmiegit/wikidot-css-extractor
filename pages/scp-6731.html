**Special Containment Procedures:** One instance of SCP-6731, hereafter referred to as SCP-6731-1, is contained at Site 184.  SCP-6731 is to be contained within a Level 5 Aquatic Containment Unit.  The interior of the containment unit must be inspected daily by unmanned submersible for damage.  

Only Class-D personnel are permitted within SCP-6731-1&#39;s containment unit for any reason.  All repairs must be performed by unmanned submersibles aided by Class-D personnel.  SCP-6731-1 has been fitted with a tracking device similar to those used to track normal sharks in the event of a containment breach.

MTF Gamma-6 is to monitor any incident of a ship lost at sea for signs of further SCP-6731 instances.

**Description:** SCP-6731 is a large aquatic creature that appears to be a chimera of three known, non-anomalous terrestrial species, measuring 15.4m from nose to end of the tentacles.  Those species being; //Mitsukurina owstoni// [Goblin Shark], //Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni// [Colossal Squid], and //Macroregonia macrochira// [Long-Clawed Spider Crab].  

SCP-6731 has chitinous armor, 16cm thick and highly resistant to all forms of physical damage, resembling that of the Long-Clawed Spider Crab the only gaps are between plates, the eyes, the gills, underside of the tentacles, and the interior of the beak and mouth.  SCP-6731 appears most like the Goblin Shark from the anterior end (the head) to just past the dorsal fin.  SCP-6731 does not possess pectoral fins in line with the Goblin Shark, but instead SCP-6731 has fins similar to the Colossal Squid on the ventral side.

On the posterior end (the tail end) the body of SCP-6731 shifts into a secondary head resembling,  the Colossal Squid.  Water jets similar to the Colossal Squid are also present.  SCP-6731 has ten appendages attached radially around the posterior end; four tentacles resembling  the Colossal Squid, four legs resembling the Long-Clawed Spider Crab, and two claws resembling the Long-Clawed Spider Crab, with additional serrated edges. 

After extensive imaging scans, it can be determined that SCP-6731 has three hearts and two brains, which may attest to the difficulty in maintaining homeostasis, that is retaining its bodily function, with such an unusual organism.  Furthermore testing has shown that it has almost no blind spots in its vision.

**Incident 6731.01 Summary:** On 18/12/2019, the USCGC //Washington// was on a standard patrol mission off the coast of Guam.  The patrol proceeded as normal, until the //Washington// apparently struck a then unknown object, now known to be SCP-6731-1, at 21:17 ChST approximately 3 miles east of Guam.  Attached is the radio log between Captain D. Morelli of the USCGC //Washington// and Petty Officer K. Angelo on duty at the radio station on Naval Base Guam.

&gt; 
&gt; **21:18:12 Captain Morelli:** USCGC //Washington// to Naval Base Guam, come in Naval Base Guam. Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **21:18:20 Petty Officer Angelo:** Naval Base Guam, we read you USCGC //Washington//.  What&#39;s going on? Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **21:18:34 Captain Morelli:**  Naval Base Guam, we are currently at 13° 36&#39; 9.5256&#39;&#39; N 145° 0&#39; 26.5824&#39;&#39; E and have run aground on an uncharted hazard.  Minor damage sustained, but nothing serious found yet.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **21:18:40 Petty Officer Angelo:** Understood USCGC //Washington//, we will...
&gt; 
&gt; **21:18:42** //Petty Officer Angelo is cut off by Captain Morelli.//
&gt; 
&gt; **21:18:42 Captain Morelli:**  Mayday, mayday, we need immediate rescue.  I...
&gt; 
&gt; **21:18:47** //The USCGC Washington is stops responding.//
&gt; 
&gt; **21:19:01 Petty Officer Angelo:** Mayday received USCGC //Washington//, scrambling a rescue immediately.  Over.
&gt; 


That was the last radio communication with the USCGC //Washington//, it can be assumed the engines flooded and power was lost during their last transmission.  The USCGC //Washington// was lost at sea, presumably with all hands.  Foundation Agents within Naval Base Guam immediately began to contain the rumors, contacting the Foundation requesting the immediate deployment of a Mobile Task Force.  The base was locked down, and Class C Amnestics were administered.  Cover Story, the USCGC //Washington// was lost to a freak storm that never made landfall.

**[21/12/2019] Operation 6731 Alpha:** Following Incident 6731.01, MTF Gamma-6 &#34;Deep Feeders&#34; was deployed to Guam in order to assess the potential danger of the uncontained anomaly.  Coordinating with Foundation Agents on Guam Naval Base, MTF Gamma-6 were able to locate and perform a saturation dive on the wreck of the USCGC //Washington//.  Damage report and transcription of video log from Operation 6731 Alpha are attached.

&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** The video was taken from a camera mounted to Agent Roger&#39;s head.
&gt;  -----
&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; **13:00:00** //The video feed shows the interior of small bunk room.  Two other agents are suited up in full saturation diving gear.  Their rubber boots squeak as they step into the dive bell.  Each agent is also equipped with a high-yield speargun, approved as a measure of self defense should the anomaly attack.  The sea is calm, barely rocking the vessel.//
&gt; 
&gt;  **13:00:01 Agent Rogers:**  Radio check. Over.
&gt;  
&gt;  **13:00:03 Agent Chavez:** Check. Over.
&gt; 
&gt;  **13:00:05 Agent Lambert:** Check. Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **13:00:13 Agent Atkins:** I read all of you.  All systems are good.  I&#39;m sealing the bell.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **13:00:21 Agent Rogers:** Roger that Atkins.  Alright, you all know everything there is to know.  We will inspect the USCGC //Washington// from bow to stern.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt;  **13:02:01** //A quick affirmative nod from the two other agents standing with Agent Rogers in the cramped space.//
&gt; 
&gt; **13:02:02 Agent Atkins:** You got it, let us know if you encounter any difficulties.  Sending you down now.  Over. 
&gt; 
&gt; **13:02:05 Agent Rogers:** Will do.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **13:02:06** //The camera lurches slightly, and the bell begins to descend into the ocean.  The sky is briefly visible through the viewport, before the bell hits the water and begins to descend rapidly.//
&gt; 
&gt;  **13:15:21** //The USCGC Washington comes into view of their powerful dive lights, resting on its starboard side at a depth of 284 meters.  The stern of the ship is crushed and mangled, huge holes torn away from the hull.  Smaller holes are also present along the stern.//
&gt; 
&gt; **13:15:22 Agent Lambert:** Holy shit....
&gt; 
&gt; **13:15:30 Agent Rogers:** We have a visual the USCGC //Washington//.  She is clearly in rough shape. We appear to be on target for the bell to land near mid-ship.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **13:15:43 Agent Atkins:** Noted, no sign of the anomaly topside.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **13:15:51 Agent Rogers:** Thanks Atkins, keep us updated.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **13:16:05 Agent Atkins:** Will do.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **13:16:20** //The agents reach the seafloor.  A dull thud can be heard as the dive bell settles onto the seafloor.  The moonpool door opens, and the divers soon step out onto the seafloor themselves.  Agent Chavez remains in the bell to monitor their systems.//
&gt; 
&gt; **13:17:43** //Agents Rogers and Lambert reach the bow of the USCGC Washington.  They begin to carefully inspect the keel of the ship for any sings of impact.//
&gt; 
&gt; **13:17:50 Agent Rogers:** We have reached the hull of the USCGC //Washington//.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt;  **13:23:44**  //Agent Lambert waves the other two agents over to examine an inward dent on the keel of the USCGC Washington, measuring approximately three meters across, the deepest part of the dent being approximately half a meter in depth.//
&gt; 
&gt; **13:23:51 Agent Lambert:** We found the initial strike.  A curved dent that matches the shape of a large shark, about three meters across. Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **13:24:12 Agent Atkins:**  Observation noted.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **13:24:24** //The agents turn about and begin to walk along the hull until they reach mid-ship.//
&gt; 
&gt; **13:28:37** //A large breach in the hull comes into view.  The hull almost appears to have been punched out from the inside.  The agents reach it and shine their lights around the interior of the USCGC Washington, which is completely mangled.  The breach is measured to be 4 meters in diameter by Agent Rogers.  Agent Lambert attaches a magnetic strobe light to the edge of the breach.//
&gt; 
&gt; **13:31:15 Agent Rogers:** Chavez, are our systems still good?  Atkins, any update topside?  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **13:31:26 Agent Atkins:**  Still no sign of the anomaly topside.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **13:31:32 Agent Chavez:** All systems are good Captain.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **13:31:39** //Agent Rogers leads the way into the wreck.  They carefully avoid the jagged and shredded metal as they walk through the interior of the ship, carefully watching their umbilicals to avoid catching them on anything.  Several holes have been torn into walls, jagged and approximately as wide as the entrance breach.//
&gt; 
&gt; **13:36:13 Agent Lambert:** Looks like the damn thing tore through the interior of the ship.  No bodies either, probably ate the poor seamen. God rest their souls.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **13:42:25** //The agents reach the bridge, entering through what would have been the floor of the bridge.  Even here there is no sign of the crew&#39;s bodies, not even blood.  Every console within the bridge has been smashed into small pieces.  Agent Lambert pulls out the blackbox, which has been shattered and destroyed.//
&gt; 
&gt; **13:42:32 Agent Lambert:** Well there goes what could have been our biggest source of intel.  Dammit. Oh, uh over.
&gt; 
&gt; **13:42:47 Agent Rogers:** If we check the stern, then we should find more information.  It seemed to have more damage than the rest of the ship even from a distance.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **13:43:56** //The two agents begin to walk back out the way they came, carrying their umbilicals with them to ensure they do not become tangled.  Without further issue, the strobe light comes back into view.  The agents look up towards the surface, though all that can be seen at this depth is the total darkness beyond the reach of their floodlights.//
&gt; 
&gt; **13:56:43 Agent Rogers:** Atkins, we have exited the wreck for now, and have not heard any update for some time.  Do you copy?  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **13:57:08** //The agents begin to glance at each other, there is no response from Agent Atkins.//
&gt; 
&gt; **13:57:32 Agent Rogers:** Atkins do you read us?  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **13:47:37 Agent Chavez:** Captain, I&#39;ve lost connection with the SCPS //Kraken// just now, it is possible they were under attack and no one made it to the radio, we are connected only by the saturation lifeboat now.  Emergency beacon activated.  Over.
&gt;  
&gt; **13:47:40** //There is total silence for some time.//
&gt; 
&gt; **13:48:52 Agent Rogers:**  We may be adrift, but there isn&#39;t shit we can do about it.  We&#39;re trapped on the bottom until rescue comes.  Better to finish our examination of the USCGC //Washington//.   Chavez, if you see debris from the SCPS //Kraken// let me know immediately, I also need to know how much time we have.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **13:51:03 Agent Chavez:**  We have 71 hours of heliox and power from the pumps Captain.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **13:51:32 Agent Rogers:** Roger Chavez, that leaves plenty of time for rescue.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **13:51:49 Agent Chavez:** If there&#39;s anything left to rescue....
&gt; 
&gt;  **13:56:57** //Agent Rogers leads the way further along the hull.//
&gt; 
&gt; **14:03:12**  //The agents reach the stern of the USCGC Washington and begin to inspect the damage.  The hull is rippling, with waves of crushed metal.  The largest hole in the stern is a portion ripped upwards, with serrated markings on both the interior and exterior of the metal hull.//
&gt; 
&gt;  **14:05:38 Agent Lambert:** The anomaly has some sort of pincers or similar, which pierced and peeled away the hull on the portside.  I suspect that damage on the starboard side may be more severe, since the //Washington// sunk on that side.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **14:08:17** //The agents enter the stern section, climbing down to the starboard side.  The interior of the stern section is just as mangled as the exterior of the stern.  Indeed, it is even more mangled than the mid-ship section was.//
&gt; 
&gt; **14:25:33** //The agents reach the far side of the USCGC Washington.  A long interior hallway is visible, with several holes evidently a meter or more in width visible.  There is a moment of silence.  A ripped U.S. Coast Guard uniform is stuck to a ripped piece of metal near one of the breaches.  There is a small amount of blood staining the uniform.  Agent Lambert is the first one into this hallway.//
&gt; 
&gt; **14:26:02 Agent Lambert:** The anomaly sunk the //Washington// quickly, the sheer amount of damage is astounding.  Can confirm at least one crew member deceased due to finding a bloody uniform.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **14:26:40 Agent Rogers:** Can you safely approach and check the uniform for a name?  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **14:26:47 Agent Lambert:** Yes, Sir. Over. 
&gt; 
&gt; **14:26:50** //Agent Lambert approaches the uniform, lightly swaying in the slight current.  The interior of the uniform shows a name embroidered on the right side.//
&gt; 
&gt; **14:27:01 Agent Lambert:** Reeds, his name was Reed, Sir.  Uniform matches that of a Seaman.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **14:27:11** //There is a moment of silence for the deceased Seaman.//
&gt; 
&gt; **14:27:47 Agent Chavez:** Captain, I see the stern of the SCPS //Kraken//, she is coming to rest about 100 meters from the dive bell.  She shows similar damage to the //Washington// as well.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **14:27:56 Agent Rogers:** Is the dive bell in danger?  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **14:28:01 Agent Chavez:** Negative, though the bow is not in sight.  I cannot tell if the //Kraken// broke apart or remained intact.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **14:28:09** //The agents begin to make their way back through the wreck.  Both of them gripping their spearguns tightly.//
&gt; 
&gt; **14:41:17** //Just as they are about to exit the wreck, a dull thud echoes across the seafloor.  The stern of the SCPS Kraken has come to rest on the seafloor.  She is shredded at midship, she had broken apart.//
&gt; 
&gt; **14:43:12 Agent Lambert:** Fucking Hell, Atkins...
&gt; 
&gt; **14:46:18** //The reality of the situation presses on the agents like the immense pressure of the ocean above them.//
&gt; 
&gt; **14:53:21 Agent Rogers:** We still need to check the screws.  The beacon won&#39;t bring us reinforcements for at least a half-hour, and they probably won&#39;t be able to retrieve us.  We can check them and then head for the bell, Lambert.  I think we have proven that this wreck won&#39;t protect us anyway.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **14:54:01** //Agent Lambert nods, and the two of them begin to walk along the hull once again, moving much slower than before.  Heads turning back and forth slowly, jerking rapidly whenever the wreck of the USCGC Washington creaks or groans.//
&gt; 
&gt; **15:13:36** //The screw mounts come into view.  The twin screws are no where within the range of their lights.  Evidently they were ripped off during the attack and discarded.//
&gt; 
&gt; **15:14:12 Agent Lambert:** Perhaps it attacked the screws in order to immobilize the //Washington//.  We should consider it possibly intelligent.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **15:14:21 Agent Rogers:** Affirmative Lambert, we should make for the bell now.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **15:14:30** //The two agents begin to walk back to the dive bell, and reach it a few minutes later.  All three of them sit and talk idly to pass the time.//
&gt; 
&gt; **[EXTRANEOUS RADIO CHATTER EXPUNGED]**
&gt; 
&gt; **15:33:12** //The agents turn their head sharply, a red light indicating an attempt at radio contact.//
&gt; 
&gt; **15:33:15 Agent Blevins:** Rescue Team Kappa to Dive Team, do you read me?  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **15:33:27 Agent Rogers:** We hear you rescue.  You arrived quickly.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **15:33:41 Agent Blevins:** We are in a chopper, we needed to confirm your location.  Rescue might be a bit dicey, but there&#39;s a ship on the way that can lift you out of there.
&gt; 
&gt; **15:42:11 Agent Rogers:** We&#39;ll be here.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **22:01:10** //Rescue Team Kappa is able to rescue the Dive Team without further incident, though they had to wait on the seafloor for over seven hours.  The crew of the SCPS Kraken is declared KIA//

&gt; 
&gt; **Damage Report on Wreck of USCGS //Washington// by MTF Gamma-6 Agent Rogers**
&gt; 
&gt;  **Hull:** Breached in multiple locations.  Stern section crushed.  Additionally, sections show signs of direct piercing and pulling away of the hull.  In layman&#39;s terms, the stern of the ship is completely mangled.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interior:** The interior shows signs of damage, though it is less severe midship than in the aft.
&gt; 
&gt;  **Bow:** The exterior of the bow section show that it has bent inwards, likely from striking the anomaly.
&gt; 
&gt; **Screws:** Ripped off of the stern of the ship.
&gt; 
&gt; **Other Notes:** There is no sign of any of the crewmen&#39;s corpses, presumed to be consumed by the anomaly.
&gt; 

[[/collapsible]]

The conclusion is that the uncontained anomaly likely measures in excess of 10m in length, and is capable of severe destruction.  A reinforced containment tank measuring 20mx10mx10m disguised as a set of cargo containers was ordered by MTF Gamma-6 to be loaded on the SCPS //Mariana// a small cargo ship retrofitted with a reinforced hull, more bulkhead compartments, etc.

**Addendum 6731.01**
While waiting for the SCPS //Mariana// to arrive in Guam, Seaman Collins was found adrift at sea in one of the life rafts USCGC //Washington//.  Seaman was taken in for interview before being amnestized.

[[collapsible show=&#34; [23/12/2019] Interview Log 6731.01&#34; hide=&#34; Access Granted&#34;]]

&gt; **Interviewed:** Seaman Collins
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Agent Blevins
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Seaman Collins was interviewed under the guise of an NCIS investigation in their hospital room while being treated for acute dehydration.  MTF Gamma-6 agents were able to gain control over all video surveillance outside and inside the hospital in order to prevent the interview&#39;s contents from being leaked.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log, 23/12/2019 [13:15:32]&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Blevins:** Alright, just to confirm for the record, you are Seaman Collins of the USCGC //Washington//?  I should also note, this interview is strictly confidential.
&gt; 
&gt; **Seaman Collins:** Yes Sir.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Blevins:** Where were you when the attack occurred?
&gt; 
&gt; **Seaman Collins:** I was in my bunk, getting my shut eye.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Blevins:** What is the first thing you remember?
&gt; 
&gt; **Seaman Collins:** I, well, you&#39;re going to think I&#39;m crazy.  No fucking way you believe what I saw, Sir.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Blevins:** We have already sent divers to the wreck, and recognize it was destroyed in an, unusual manner.
&gt; 
&gt; **Seaman Collins:** Well, if I had to identify it, we were under attack by a fucking kraken.  A large beak was tearing a hole in the hull just outside my bunkroom.  The Captain had already sounded the abandon ship order.  I made my way topside, and found tentacles swarming the deck.  I barely was able to dive into the nearest life raft and launch.  Thankfully the beastie didn&#39;t notice me.  I think most of the crew was already lost, eaten by that monster.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Blevins:** Thank you, did you notice anything else?
&gt; 
&gt; **Seaman Collins:** Captain Morelli, he had drawn his sidearm and was firing at the beastie.  He, he yelled at me to get going.  The shots just, fucking bounced off.  Captain
&gt; 
&gt; //Seaman Collins begins to shake uncontrollably.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Blevin:** Seaman Collins...?
&gt; 
&gt; **Seaman Collins:** I watched one of those damn tentacles wrap around the captain, crushing him.  I... I floated away, watching her sink.  She was dragged below the waves, so, so quickly.  Damn thing took out a cutter like it was a snack.  She was over a hundred feet long, and, I watched her taken to Davy Jones.
&gt; 
&gt; //Seaman Collins begins to cry again, shaking violently, evidently having a trauma induced episode.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Blevins:** Thank you, that will be all.  Try and recover as best you can Seaman.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log, [13:21:13]&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Seaman Collins was amnestizied with Class A Amnestics immediately following the interview.

**[25/12/2019] Operation 6731 Beta:** Following the results of Operation 6731 Alpha, three additional squads of members from MTF Gamma-6 were sent to reinforce the original squad sent to investigate the anomaly.  Along with the SCPS //Mariana// and the requested containment unit.

A simple plan was formulated, float around in the area where both incidents occurred, and wait for the anomaly to attack.  Once spotted, MTF Gamma-6 will drop a heavy-duty steel net around the anomaly.  Once the net is secured, electrical shocks will be applied to the anomaly until it is rendered unconscious.  SCPS //Mariana&#39;s// cargo cranes will then lift the contained anomaly into the container for transit to Site 184.  In the event that the anomaly will only appear directly beneath the ship, shocks will be applied to drive it out to either side.  Attached is a log from the operation.

&gt; 
&gt; **Written Log by Agent Gibson, responsible for monitoring the camera feeds.**
&gt; 
&gt; [Begin Log]
&gt; 
&gt; **14:00:00** The SCPS //Mariana// crosses over the wreck of the USCGC //Washington//.  Hereafter referred to as the Central Point.  The SCPS //Mariana// is cruising at a speed of 5 knots.  MTF Agents can be seen on high alert across the deck of the ship from the bridge.  Camera feed clearly shows both the deck, and the ocean on all sides of the SCPS //Mariana//, the underside of the ship is also clearly visible.  There are no blind spots.
&gt; 
&gt; **15:00:00** All is quiet.  The SCPS //Mariana// is lazily circling the Central Point a quarter mile out.  Hourly check-ins will be maintained until contact is established.
&gt; 
&gt; **22:43:12** A swift moving, dark shadow, is seen below the SCPS //Mariana//, approximately 15 meters in length.  The SCPS //Mariana// is still lazily circling the Central Point a quarter mile out.  The crew is warned that the anomaly may attack shortly.
&gt; 
&gt; **23:00:00** All is still quiet despite the recent contact.  Sonar has not yet located the anomaly, and the sea is dark.  Visual range is limited, and the crew is uneasy.  The SCPS //Mariana// is lazily circling the Central Point a quarter mile out.
&gt; 
&gt; **23:09:34** The cameras on the SCPS //Mariana// spot a dark shape moving towards the ship at high speeds.  Sonar is able to lock onto the anomaly and track it&#39;s approach, at speeds indicated to be in excess of 60 knots.
&gt; 
&gt; **23:09:35** The alarm is sounded as the anomaly rapidly approaches the SCPS //Mariana// from the east.
&gt; 
&gt;  **23:09:39** The SCPS //Mariana// rocks violently as the anomaly slams into the starboard side of the vessel.  Crew below decks report that the vessel has begun to take on water, with a large break and set of claws tearing away at the hull.  Bulkheads automatically close and seal off the attacked section of the hull and 1 crewmember.  There is no risk of sinking or the ship becoming unstable.  Camera feeds show a creature with various appendages, and shark-like features clinging to the hull.
&gt; 
&gt; **23:10:05** MTF Gamma-6 drops the prepared steel net over the anomaly.  The anomaly does not seem to take any notice of this.  The hull breach widens enough that one additional bulkhead shuts automatically.  The ship is still stable.
&gt; 
&gt; **23:10:06 Agent Lynn:** Confirmed that the anomaly has claws.  Initial impact gave it enough force to breach the hull.  However the reinforced hull seems to be giving it significant trouble with widening the breach or creating new ones.  Tentacles also confirmed, they are unable to get a grip on a ship this large though.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **23:10:57** MTF Gamma-6 confirms that the netting is secured.
&gt; 
&gt; **23:11:03** Shocks administered.  The anomaly begins to strain against the net and try to pull away.  The motors pulling on the cables show significant strain.
&gt; 
&gt; **23:11:22 Agent Rogers:** Increase the voltage!  Its only getting pissed!  Over!
&gt; 
&gt; **23:11:30** Voltage increased.
&gt; 
&gt; **23:15:49** The anomaly ceases movement.
&gt; 
&gt; **23:15:52 Agent Rogers:**  The anomaly has ceased movement.  Begin lifting it into the containment unit.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **23:16:00** The cranes lift the anomaly up over the deck, and placed into the containment unit.  Anesthetics are pumped into the unit to keep it unconscious.
&gt; 
&gt; **23:17:17 Agent Rogers:** Anomaly is secured, wrapped up like a present.  Good work people.  Over.
&gt; 
&gt; **23:17:30** The SCPS //Mariana// begins to sail back towards Naval Base Guam.  Arrangements are made for swift repairs before transit of anomaly to Site 184.
&gt;

Containment was maintained until arrival at Site 184 by pumping the water in the containment unit with sedatives on an hourly basis.  The early warning signs of declining health upon arrival, however, meant that this method was deemed insufficient as a long term solution to contain SCP-6731.

**Addendum 6731.02**
Upon SCP-6731-1&#39;s arrival at Site-184, DNA and tissue samples were taken for analysis.  A physiological analysis showed that SCP-6731-1 has female sex organs and is hypothetically capable of reproduction.  Dr. Walton proposes that this is evidence enough to be concerned that further instances of SCP-6731 could one day surface, and advised that Foundation assets monitor for any sign of SCP-6731 once again threatening the veil.

**Addendum 6731.03** DNA research suggests that SCP-6731 should not be able to survive in pressure systems except those experienced at a depth of 1km or deeper.  How SCP-6731-1 has thrived in lower pressure environments is currently unknown.  Attempts to pressurize the containment unit caused SCP-6731-1 to become distressed and to emit painful screeches.
