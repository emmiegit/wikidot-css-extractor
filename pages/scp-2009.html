[[include component:image-block name=Mold.jpg|caption=An instance of SCP-2009-01, formerly D-998120-W.]]

**Item #:** SCP-2009

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Samples of SCP-2009-02 are to be kept in refrigerated BSL-4-compliant storage at Bio Site 98. Should an instance of SCP-2009-01 be required for testing or interview purposes, a single D-Class personnel is to be exposed to three grams of SCP-2009-02. Following exposure, the infected individual is to be contained in a BSL-4-compliant containment cell for a period of no less than nine days, after which point it is to be treated as a new instance of SCP-2009-01. Infection of D-class personnel with SCP-2009-02 is to take place only with the approval of at least two on-site Level 4 personnel.

For the duration of testing, the instance of SCP-2009-01 is to be held in a BSL-4-compliant containment cell kept at 10° C. Humidity in the cell of SCP-2009-01 is to be kept at 0%. Foundation personnel are to wear Level A hazmat suits when interacting with SCP-2009-01, and are to undergo full decontamination following interaction. Following completion of testing or interaction, the instance of SCP-2009-01 is to be destroyed and its remains incinerated.

Medical facilities, news media, and law enforcement are to be monitored to detect uncontained instances of SCP-2009. After confirmation and assessment of scale, Mobile Task Force Rho-8 &#34;Mushroom Hunters&#34; is to be dispatched to effect containment.

**Description:** SCP-2009-01 is the designation for all instances of an anomalous male humanoid capable of asexual reproduction by means of spores. Instances of SCP-2009-01 are genetically identical, and prior to mutation, display no unusual physiology. Instances of SCP-2009-01 are fully sapient and are capable of socializing normally up until the point of production of instances of SCP-2009-02. Instances of SCP-2009-01 identify themselves as &#34;Thomas Hoang.&#34; No instance exhibits knowledge of its anomalous properties. All instances also have a shared baseline of memories including childhood and early adulthood taking place in the community of Pollensbee, CA[[footnote]]No community by such a name, nor having any of the features described by SCP-2009-01, is recorded to have existed.[[/footnote]]. 

If exposed to temperatures of more than 20° C and humidity in excess of 40%[[footnote]]Instances of SCP-2009-01 exhibit no inclination to expose themselves to such conditions.[[/footnote]] for a period in excess of five days, SCP-2009-01 will seek out a darkened area, with preference given to tall buildings and places adjacent to high foot traffic areas. The body of SCP-2009-01 will begin to distend and split into thin chitin-based &#34;hairs.&#34; These hairs will be used by SCP-2009-01 to anchor itself to nearby walls and objects and, if possible, draw limited sustenance from them. SCP-2009-01 will cease sapient activity, converting all of its energy to the production of SCP-2009-02. SCP-2009-01 will continue the production and release of SCP-2009-02 until it eventually dies of exhaustion.

SCP-2009-02 is a microscopic spore created by SCP-2009-01, capable of infecting human beings. During a typical period of production, SCP-2009-01 is capable of producing 55 kg of SCP-2009-02. Instances of SCP-2009-02 are airborne and infect humans through the respiratory system. Within 3-4 days of exposure, individuals infected with SCP-2009-02 will begin to experience symptoms of nausea, lethargy, and photosensitivity. Additionally, individuals will shun social contact, isolating themselves from others. Within 5-8 days, the physiology of infected individuals will begin to change to match that of SCP-2009-01. The process can cause varying levels of discomfort, proportional to the physiological similarities between the individual and SCP-2009-01. Infected individuals are aware of the changes, and frequently exhibit extreme psychological distress during the process. Within 8-9 days of exposure, the physiology of the subject will exactly match that of SCP-2009-01, as will its baseline psychological state, DNA, and memories. Newly-created instances of SCP-2009-01 exhibit no knowledge of their lives prior to transformation.

SCP-2009 was discovered when reports of a widespread infection by a previously unknown disease in the town of ████ ████████, MO were made to the Center For Disease Control on ███/███/1998. Foundation agents embedded in the initial response team reported extreme physiological changes brought on by exposure to SCP-2009-02 in 46% of the town&#39;s residents. The town was immediately quarantined, with infected individuals being taken into Foundation custody. The CDC teams and the remainder of the town&#39;s residents were isolated until the nature of SCP-2009 became apparent. The town was destroyed and incinerated under the cover of a story of &#34;freak wildfire&#34; on ██/███/1998. The CDC teams and uninfected residents were dosed with Class-E amnestics and released from Foundation custody the next day. All but three of the newly created instances of SCP-2009-01 were destroyed and incinerated, with the rest used for purposes of testing and the creation of instances of SCP-2009-02 for purposes of study.

During the destruction of ████ ████████, the desiccated remains of an instance of SCP-2009-01 were found in the bell tower of ████ ████████ First Methodist Church. It is suspected that this instance was the original vector for SCP-2009-01, although it is unknown whether it was the original instance of SCP-2009-01.

**Interview Log 2009-7m 11/13/1999**
&gt; **Interviewed:** D-998120-W, an African female, four days after exposure to SCP-2009-02. Interview took place in a darkened BSL-4-compliant containment cell.
&gt;  
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Ahmedov
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Ahmedov:** Hello, D-998120-W. How are you feeling today?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-998120-W:** [silence].
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ahmedov:** If you do not feel like cooperating, D-998120-W, I can turn the lights up.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-998120-W:** Awful. I feel awful. I feel like vomiting, the light hurts. Everything hurts. What did you give me?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ahmedov:** I&#39;m sorry to hear that. Please describe your earliest memory, if you would.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-998120-W:** I- wha? If I answer, can you go away?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ahmedov:** Once you answer, this interview will be complete. Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-998120-W:** Okay, I was five or six. My mother had had to work late and when she got in, she just fell into the chair in the living room and fell asleep. I thought that she had died.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ahmedov:** What did your mother look like?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-998120-W:** What do you mean? She looked the same as she normally does? Short, kinda dark yellow skin, round chin.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ahmedov:** Thank you for yo-
&gt; 
&gt; **D-998120-W:** Wait, what the...? That can&#39;t be right. What di-
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ahmedov:** Thank you, that will be all.
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Interview Log 2009-7n 11/15/1999**
&gt; 
&gt; **Interview notes:** D-998120-W had been informed that any feelings of bodily dysphoria were a result of vaccination against &#34;malign restricula.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ahmedov:** D-998120-W, how are you today?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-998120-W:** I-I&#39;m not good, really.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ahmedov:** Oh? And why is that?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-998120-W:** There&#39;s all of this... noise. Like I&#39;m not me, I&#39;m people.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ahmedov:** And who are you?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-998120-W:** Thomas Hoang. I mean, I know I&#39;m Thomas Hoang. But I keep remembering this stuff, like my dad dying when I was a kid or getting a C in art class. But, they&#39;re... it&#39;s not me. I&#39;m from Pollensbee, not Columbus. My dad is still alive. I mean, do you want to hear the weirdest part?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ahmedov:** Please.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-998120-W:** I remember stuff, like girl stuff. Like having... ugh, you know what? Nevermind. I didn&#39;t just say that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ahmedov:** I think I understand.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-998120-W:** Like, y&#39;know, I&#39;m comfortable with myself and everything. It&#39;s just... is this going to be a thing?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ahmedov:** No, no. Such a reaction to the regimen we&#39;ve put you on is totally within parameters; you should be over it in a day or so.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-998120-W:** Okay, thanks doc.
&gt; **&lt;End log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt;  **Closing Statement:** On ██/██/1999, the transformation of D-998120-W into an instance of SCP-2009-01 was completed. Following completion of testing, the instance was incinerated.
