&gt; a letter addressed to you came in today.
&gt; i tore it open to see it was a life insurance plan.
&gt; not that you need it anymore, since you&#39;re gone.
&gt; not that you would have been able to afford it anyway,
&gt; your meager government income wouldn&#39;t have allowed it.
&gt; you were a woman who made ends meet,
&gt; by cutting any corner she could and never splurging.
&gt; even after you moved in with me,
&gt; you refused to treat yourself to nice things,
&gt; so i made sure to treat you to nice things instead.

&gt; i tore it open to see it was an offer for a credit card.
&gt; not that you need it anymore, since you&#39;re gone.
&gt; not that you would have been able to use it anyway,
&gt; your lifestyle wasn&#39;t luxurious or extravagant.
&gt; you were a simple person of simple pleasures,
&gt; the love of your grandchildren was all you needed,
&gt; and i was happy to provide it to you,
&gt; even when you could no longer recognize me,
&gt; because you cared for me before i could care for myself.

&gt; a letter addressed to you came in today.
&gt; i tore it open to see it was a piece of political propaganda.
&gt; not that you need it anymore, since you&#39;re gone.
&gt; not that you would have found a use for it anyway,
&gt; your political views were set in stone ever since the reagan administration.
&gt; and that&#39;s why i never let you find out about me.
&gt; that i was anything other than cishet.
&gt; it would have eaten at you and would have made you hate me,
&gt; your favorite grandchild, who always spoiled you,
&gt; and loved you no matter how much you hurt me with your beliefs.

&gt; a letter addressed to you came in today.
&gt; i didn&#39;t tear it open.
&gt; instead, i just tossed it.
&gt; maybe this is what you call moving on.
&gt; maybe it&#39;s me growing numb to losing you.
&gt; maybe this is just learning to cope.
&gt; the letters won&#39;t stop, i know this.
&gt; and i&#39;ll always remember you when they come.
&gt; even if it&#39;s in a cynical way, thinking;
&gt; &#34;she&#39;s been dead for years, why do they still send these?&#34;
