**Special Containment Procedures:** The Containment Procedures of [/scp-4260/offset/0 Iteration α.4260] have been deemed unsuitable for the prolonged containment of SCP-4260. As such, Experimental Operation “Many-Crowned Serpent” was executed on 02/13/2016, in order to achieve optimal containment. As a result, the nature of SCP-4260 has been radically altered; errors persist throughout the following description.[[footnote]] Original drafting date: 09/26/2000; update pending. [[/footnote]]

**Description:** SCP-4260 is the collective consciousness of an essophysical entity which has permeated itself through the known universe. SCP-4260&#39;s existence has resulted in the biological senescence of sentient organisms and is the direct cause of any organism&#39;s cessation of life functions.

SCP-4260 itself is subject to its own entropy, and its anomalous influence on the universe has notably diminished in the preceding millennia. It is projected that SCP-4260 will expire by achieving an essophysical null-state in 2017 CE. The former containment procedures of SCP-4260 proved both incapable of halting this effect and its primary anomalous trait, although complete physical containment was achieved.

Procedure 8917 was finalized in March of 1999, and involved the termination of SCP-4260 — which would result in an [[[End of Death Hub | ΩK-Class (&#34;End-of-Death&#34;) Scenario]]] — and its immediate reanimation via anomalous means; the procedure was designed to prevent the deaths of high-profile individuals within the Foundation and global extinction, if either event arose.

Ahem, alright, time to begin.

I am Dr. Preston Bracks, lead of RTF Iota-39 and Assistant Director of our little Essophysics Department. I call it &#34;little&#34; because we only have about twenty members — it actually came as a bit of a shock to us when we received your, erm, invitation. Thought you&#39;d forgotten about us.

Regardless, The Essophysics Department is dedicated to the study of entities which embody certain universal concepts, such as Time, Science, and in the case of SCP-4260, Death. Old cultures referred to them as gods, which is a bit of a misnomer; we call them Intrinsics. Gods are reality-bending entities, usually with their own agendas and identities. Intrinsics are concepts which cannot be separated from our cosmos without us living in a radically different world. They’re more concept than entity, and rarely take any sort of physical form. SCP-4260 is somewhat of an anomaly in that regard.

As it stands, modern parascience is woefully ignorant of the basics of essophysical reality. We have no idea how many Intrinsics exist, if they can be contacted, and what degree of agency each one has. The avenue towards containment, then, is research. I&#39;m sure most of you have been briefed about SCP-4260&#39;s retrieval last year, so I won&#39;t belabor any points, but SCP-4260’s behaviors have proven to be beyond insightful.

First, we know that these things aren’t omniscient or all-knowing, because it came to us with hopes that we would know how to save it. It was wrong.

Second, we know it’s smart. It chose the form of an elderly human, superficially unthreatening and incapable of violence — this was a calculated decision, meant to incline Mu-8 and Iota-39 towards helping it instead of combatting it. It succeeded.

SCP-4260 does not have a defined personality, nor does it have any goals or motivations beyond self-preservation. When the universe was new, its strength was incalculable. Life could not even hope to begin. Death was everywhere in the dark, dark expanse of a lonely cosmos. But over time, a miracle occurred, maybe the first anomaly: Death began to die. Slowly, ever so slowly, it began to be poisoned by its own ever-present miasma. The million claws which reached from the dark and tore down civilization took hold of their master as well, dragging it screaming into the abyss.

Death is dying under //our// roof, Councilmembers. And that is the most terrifying, and most fantastic news humanity may ever receive.

**Item #:** SCP-4260

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4260 is to be quarantined in secure facility Area-03, which has been converted into a secure facility location, designed to protect SCP-4260 from most documented K-Class &#34;End-of-the-World&#34; scenarios. The facility has been staffed minimally, and no individual is to enter the central underground chamber housing SCP-4260 at any time.

The central chamber in which SCP-4260 is contained is classified as a large-scale entity containment unit and has been augmented with a concurrent circuit of seven Strayer Density Matrices, maintained by MTF Gamma-8 (&#34;Baphomites&#34;). If SCP-4260 attempts to exit its containment chamber or contact any of the facility staff, O5-3, O5-4, and O5-10[[footnote]] Foundation Directors of //Hypothetical Scenarios//, //Existential and Pataphysical Studies//, and //Active Containment// respectively. [[/footnote]] are to be alerted as soon as is possible.

**Description:** SCP-4260 is Foundation Administrator Ethan Horowitz, who has undergone considerable physical augmentation as a result of Operation &#34;Many-Crowned Serpent&#34;.

SCP-4260&#39;s anomalous properties include, but are not limited to:

[[div class=&#34;foldable-list-container&#34;]]
* Extreme anatomical augmentations.
 * SCP-4260 qualifies as a large-scale entity, measuring 130 meters when standing and possessing a variable number of limbs which it can freely operate.
* Anatomical manipulation.
 * Although SCP-4260 usually appears to be a large-scale entity, it is capable of altering its physiology for a limited time. Alterations can be as extreme as reverting to Administrator Horowitz&#39;s nonanomalous body prior to Operation &#34;Many-Crowned Serpent&#34;.
* Resistance to injury and incapacitation.
 * It has been speculated that MTF Xi-2 (“Out of the Shadows Come We, Darkly”) would require an unprecedented damage output ordinance to complete the initial stage of Procedure 8917.
* Essophysical abilities which remain poorly understood.
 * So long as SCP-4260 remains alive, any living organism is subject to entropic decay and death.
 * SCP-4260 has become resistant to the tethering capabilities of Strayer Density Matrices; if five of the seven concurrent Matrices in its containment chamber fail simultaneously, SCP-4260 will breach containment and inadvertently initiate a χK-Class (&#34;Crowning-of-Death&#34;) Scenario.
[[/div]]

The essophysical entity previously cataloged as SCP-4260, prior to its neutralization in Operation &#34;Many-Crowned Serpent&#34;, exhibited several of these anomalous traits to a more limited degree. After its termination, Foundation Administrator Ethan Horowitz elected to transfer its anomalous properties onto his own person, in accordance with the contractual and ritualistic nature of Operation &#34;Many-Crowned Serpent&#34;.

**Addendum.4260.1:**

[[div style=&#34;background: url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/djkaktus-s-proposal/amber.png) center no-repeat ; border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 10px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);&#34;]]

**These are the Prime Directives of the Foundation:** to secure, to contain, and to protect; to remove anomalous items, persons, and phenomena from the public sphere, to effectively suppress the resurgence of these anomalies or the discovery of them by the general public, and to hold above all else but reality itself the sanctity of life and the necessity to preserve it.

**This is the Subdirective of the Foundation:** to terminate the primary anomalous phenomenon which has plagued life since life’s conception, or to facilitate the termination thereof.

**This is the prime anomaly:** Death.

The Subdirective was never meant to be feasible, at least not in the day and age of our founding. We cannot hope to mitigate the disasters that this would result in: overpopulation, species stagnation, and susceptibility to cataclysmic extra-dimensional forces which can only be contained via euthanization of those affected. It remained the lonely dream of the men who began our venture to order chaos [[[A Hymn For Pandora | so many decades ago]]].

Now, over a century later, we could achieve the subdirective at any moment with only a missive sent to the lead of AF Omicron-45. I suppose it would be marvelous to see: a world without death and infirmity, each person freed from the dread of uncertainty and peril. Maybe, one day, we will find a way to make that world.

Until such a time, we must secure the perpetual containment of death. This is the nature of Many-Crowned Serpent: to fulfill the first steps of the Foundation’s subdirective.

As it stands now, Death is a hostile entity intent on its own self-preservation at any cost. We spoke, once, and I began to realize that if it could feel anything at all, it would feel the same fear we must face under its tyranny. We could not save Death from itself; as far as our science has elevated us, our understanding of reality&#39;s based components is sourly lacking. I told this to SCP-4260, and it smiled. &#34;Administrator,&#34; it said, &#34;How can I die when I will live on through you?&#34;

Death has struck a deal with us. In all its arcane knowledge, it knows a way to live on afterwards: it has chosen me to be its heir. It is a choice between the eternal agony of humanity and a pain suffered only until we know enough to repair our tired species. It is not a choice at all.

This last evil I must allow us all to suffer patiently. Be bold, for one day soon, we will have won the battle waged by both us and our ancestors emerging from the primordial soup: the struggle for Life Everlasting.
