++* HAPPY HALLOWEEN, YOU GASTLY GHOULS AND SPOOKY SKELETONS!
[[/=]]
Another year, another night of partying, trick-or-treating, dark occult rituals, and a contest too! That&#39;s right, this year we got in the spirit of the season with a Tale contest. Entrants were required to take two of the following rules and craft a tale within the parameters; 

&gt; * The tale can only have one survivor; how you define that is up to you.
&gt; * The piece itself cannot directly acknowledge that it is, in fact, Halloween, but it must be blindingly obvious based on the setting and story building.
&gt; * One of the characters has to end up in a costume, against their will, to solve some issue that comes up in the tale.
&gt; * The piece must start on Halloween and end during All Saints&#39; Day sunrise.

= Only one would emerge victorious.

You will notice little &#39;📈&#39; emojis besides some articles. That denotes SCP articles which were under 30 and tales which were under 20 when this edition of site news was posted. Give them a little love! Speaking from personal experience, the most frustrating thing that can happen to an article is not deletion, but stagnating below 20 without any comments. So try to read, vote, and comment on these articles! They&#39;re often hidden gems :)

+* Q&amp;A:

++* Q: Can I replace a blurb that you wrote for one of my articles with my own? I&#39;m not satisfied with it.

A: Absolutely. You will always have that option at any point.

++* Q: I noticed an error/typo/incorrect information and wish to correct it. May I?

A: Sure! If the changes are not limited to your own article(s) and/or are substantial changes across multiple entries, you should post in that month&#39;s discussion page and then make the changes.

++* Q: I wrote an article and it seems to have stuck. Can I send a blurb of mine to one of the frequent collaborators?

A: Yup! It&#39;s much easier if you come to us about it, and it gives you the control over what you want shown on the news page.[[/size]]
