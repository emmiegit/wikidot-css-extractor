**Item #:** SCP-256

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-256 is contained within a cubic chamber 3 m (10 ft) on a side, with 1 m (3 ft) thick walls composed of a mixture of brick and rubberized layers, with two conductive rods sticking out 18 cm (7 in) from the walls to either side of the entrance. Entrance is restricted by a soundproof airlock. Chamber is to be constantly under surveillance by EMR device and video camera. Entry and surveillance are restricted to only authorized personnel who have undergone surgical adaptation to resist the effects of SCP-256. To see a list of authorized personnel, see document SCP-256b. Personnel not on this list may enter if they are security clearance Level 3 or above, but must wear sound-canceling earphones. All personnel must be stripped of all electronics, ferrous metals and conductive material. They are also required to wear a specially designed insulated and redirective bodysuit (HAZMAT-ELEC) which must be tested before wearing, before entrance, and after exit with a significant charge. A taser is supplied and is rated high enough for testing use. The only recording allowed aside from the EMR device is done by hand. SCP standard office paper is suitable, but writing instruments must be nonconductive. Crayons are kept on hand. 

**Description:** Moved to Site 76 on 03-02-2007. SCP-256 is similar to a typewriter in most respects, except that the keys are fixed in position, rather than connected to levers, and instead of a rollbar and most of the machinery that should be present, two concave copper discs stand on either end, facing inward, 38 cm (15 in) apart. While invisible to the naked eye, EM readings show that a significant electrical charge passes between the copper discs without any conductive medium. If any of the prohibited items are brought into the containment chamber, this current increases in both amplitude and voltage, eventually arcing out and striking the object in question. This is also the reason reinforced concrete was not used in the chamber&#39;s construction, as rebar seems to agitate the artifact. It is unknown where the extra energy comes from, or even the initial current, as there seems to be no power generation source within SCP-256. If at any time this current oscillates more than the average peak of 26% on the EMR surveillance, all unauthorized personnel regardless of clearance level must immediately evacuate the chamber. Those who fail to comply are to be terminated at once, again, regardless of security clearance.

For further information, see file 256b.

&gt; 
&gt;     From: HR_76-5974
&gt;     To: BaseCommand 76-1389
&gt; 
&gt; Let me officially give you congratulations on your promotion, General Trent. It&#39;s a sad, sad thing that happened to your predecessor, but such is the way of things when working for The Foundation. Regardless, I looked into the various classified files that General Gerhart had under lock and key with your access codes, and found out some really surprising things about SCP-256.
&gt; 
&gt; First off, the list of authorized personnel are not surgically adapted in any way. In fact, many of them have never undergone anything more serious than the mandated physical. And civilians, tsk tsk. I can&#39;t even begin to understand why General Gerhart let them even know of the base. Containment agents have been dispatched to see how far their psychosis has progressed and how much they know, but from what I&#39;ve found in the late General&#39;s personal files, he supposedly had them convinced this was some kind of hospital.
&gt; 
&gt; Second, as you may have guessed from the notes on the civilians and the highly classified paper manuscripts, the &#34;authorized personnel&#34; seemed to believe quite vehemently that SCP-256 was once a young adult human named Elizabeth Waters, and has been somehow trapped in the artifact. Even the General was convinced, and the very fact that the BaseCommand was compromised by the item&#39;s delusions makes me worry about the entire facility. All personnel on the &#34;authorized&#34; list have been placed under covert surveillance. It is unknown how far the item&#39;s control over them goes, and I will be personally reviewing all other SCP security  measures enacted on General Gerhart&#39;s behalf.
&gt; 
&gt; Third, there is information on the artifact that has not been made available in the report. Firstly, the variance on the EMR is remarkably similar to an oscilloscope&#39;s pickup of human voice. Apparently when SCP-256 starts its variance, it somehow starts producing audio with it. Second, the compromised personnel write down in the manuscripts that the delusions claim to be in pain when metal is brought near it. After an audio recorder was brought into the room, the afflicted agents noted that the delusions ceased for several days, and when they resumed, they indicated that it nearly &#34;killed&#34; the artifact.
&gt; 
&gt; Needless to say, I cannot confirm or deny these rumors due to the security restraints on SCP-256, but I do not place credibility in them. Simply put, General, this was a coverup. Recommend immediate disciplinary procedures for all personnel involved. In regards to SCP-256, I recommend research into power production. As long as the research personnel observe the listed sound-blanking procedures, any possible auditory contamination can be contained. There was no listed drop in power when the &#34;little girl&#34; &#34;almost died&#34;, and more conductive material may serve to permanently suppress the risk of the artifact.
&gt; 
&gt; However, as per your new policy with advanced timetable on the destruction of destructible SCP items, I have scheduled the item for a tentative destruction on 15 January 2008.
&gt;
&gt; Your vigilant officer;
&gt; Edward Berstrom.
