+++ FORWARD

My journey starts in Boring, Oregon, the least boring city in America.

If you&#39;ve been living under a rock, you may not have heard of my good friend Allison (@blackqueen on twitter, check out her art!). And if you haven&#39;t heard of my good friend Allison, then you&#39;ve almost //certainly// haven&#39;t heard of what she allegedly found on a hike just outside Boring. Maybe you&#39;ve heard his name: Asmodeus, &#34;King of Beasts&#34;.

Like the Armadillo, Asmodeus is a fairly recent find; there&#39;s no hard evidence anyone saw him before the 2000s, and even the hypothetical trails I&#39;ve drawn up could be attributed to any ol&#39; monster in Cryptid Pattern V[[footnote]] For the uninitiated, a cryptid is sorted into Pattern V if its bite mark forms a &#34;V&#34;. [[/footnote]]. A multitude of origins for Asmodeus have been proposed: The likeliest rumor posits that Asmodeus escaped from the infamous Thule Cult of the Scarlet Simulacrum (write-up coming soon!), who were using its reptile DNA to create a cabal of immortal neo-nazi demigods. If true, Asmodeus couldn&#39;t have been around for more than thirty years, which would explain the dearth of settler and indigenous accounts.

Regardless, nobody can dispute Asmodeus&#39;s existence these days. With a multitude of photos, testimony, and carnage in Asmodeus&#39;s wake, it&#39;s an undeniable fact that a dragon has found its way into our humble home.

Already, Asmodeus&#39;s influence over the area is undeniable: people mull about listless and fearful, hopes placed into the hands of the far-off towers of an uncaring city as their insufficient infrastructure grows in obsolescence by the day. [**EDIT:** I have been told this is just what rural America looks like in a post-9/11 world, and wholeheartedly apologize to Boring for singling them out.]

None too many of the locals have seen Asmodeus. Obviously, I was frustrated; you&#39;d be after a dead end, no? But you don&#39;t quit when the going gets tough, so I moved on to the nearby Trailhead Park, off to strike green gold.

Strike it I did.

&#34;RC&#34; was a simple man who just wanted a vacation. To that end, he&#39;d booked a ticket from Portland and made his way to the park, where a simple hike turned into something so much more sinister.

[**AUTHOR&#39;S NOTE:** I&#39;d put the pictures RC shared with me here but he owns full rights to them, and will, quote, &#34;sue my ass until it&#39;s concave&#34; if I put them up on a CC-BY-SA site. Jerk.]

RC recalls biking down the Springwater Corridor when he saw a great beast thrashing about the treeline. Now, RC&#39;s no vet, but he could immediately tell that this wasn&#39;t just any critter. This beast was massive, covered in a thick matte of blood and mud with bits of flesh peeling from the poor bugger. But even so, this beast raged on, on the offensive with what RC //swore// was a pack of cougars. Looking at the pictures he took? I believe him.

(I still don&#39;t know why he wanted to take another vacation in Boring. When questioned, he told me to &#34;mind my own business&#34;.)

After purchasing some extra bear spray, I made my way up the Springwater Corridor. I didn&#39;t find Asmodeus (or any cougars for that matter), but there was a gap in the treeline that //could// have been Asmodeus. I&#39;ve got it marked on a map, which I&#39;ll be releasing once my search concludes.

More to come.

&gt; ##purple|UraniumEmpire##, do you think you could reconsider this? &#34;Asmodeus&#34; is an extremely dangerous anomaly; you can&#39;t just spray it with bear spray and expect to come out alive.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems like you really do have a passion for cryptid hunting I respect that. But the thing you&#39;re hunting is antithetical to life. Maybe consider chasing the Pineland Robots, instead?

+ UPDATE 1: On the Hunt

What&#39;s up, Parawatch! Update on the Asmodeus case.

So I did some treking today, and my //god// is Asmodeus a treat to hunt. Even before heading through the treeline gap from yesterday, I was finding //super// fun stuff.

[[include component:image-block |name=skinny.PNG|caption=Pay up, peyton.]]

Now I&#39;m no biologist, but does this look like the skin of an Oregon native? What about the the fact that I found it in near-literal sheets? What about the trail of dried, blackened goop, streaking into the woodlands like some macabre spider web?

Make no mistake, the stench is nigh //unbearable//. I literally have no words to describe it! Looks like our pal&#39;s in dire need of a wash; maybe I can point him in the right direction? :p

Sorry if my commentary isn&#39;t as witty as before, I&#39;m just //really// excited. Can you blame me? A picture&#39;s one thing (and I don&#39;t mean to imply Allison&#39;s a fraud!), but to have the proof in your hands, in ridiculous quantities, gumming up your nose with the //worst// of stenches to show you it&#39;s //real real real//, that you&#39;re on the right track... it&#39;s intoxicating, you know? It&#39;s fuel.

I had to head back into Portland to retrieve some supplies. Asmodeus won&#39;t just show up at my doorstep, which means I&#39;m gonna have to go //really// deep into the bumfuck wild. Between work and splurging on a GPS hotspot, I&#39;ve got about three more days to find Asmodeus, but what a day today&#39;s been!

Wish I could have put more here, but it&#39;s been a blur. Following the damage, the blood, the indentations that are //obviously// Asmodeus&#39;s footprints. I&#39;ve traveled a shitton of ground.

Good night, Parawatch. More to come.

As much as I hate to enable this, I can confirm that that&#39;s what &#34;Asmodeus&#34;&#39;s &#34;skin&#34; looks like.

Even if she //is// faking it, doesn&#39;t it concern anyone else that she&#39;s glorifying this ideal of an impromptu wilderness venture with the intention of encountering an //extremely// aggressive anomaly? If the wilderness doesn&#39;t kill her, I&#39;m afraid the thing she&#39;s chasing might. Isn&#39;t safety more important than internet clout?

+ UPDATE 2: Into the Woods

Did a lot of walking today. I&#39;m well out of Boring by now.

I think Asmodeus is throwing me for a loop. According to my GPS, I&#39;ve gone way out from the corridor. I&#39;m still finding bits of lizard skin, not as much as before, but the blood&#39;s stopped. Come to think of it, I didn&#39;t see too much of it near the end of the last stretch, either.

It occurs to me that, being a five foot six ape, a twenty-five foot lizard is probably faster than me. But he can&#39;t be running, can he? He must have come to Boring for a //reason//, otherwise dumb luck would have prevailed in the somethingteen years since his first sightings. Maybe he already achieved something, but what then?

I can&#39;t stop now. Not when I //know// he&#39;s out there, you know? I&#39;ve got his skin.

Also, ##orange|complicatedavrillavigne2002##: come to Portland if you want several pounds of lizard skin and an asskicking[[footnote]] jk, luv u [[/footnote]].

Two more days. More to come.

+ UPDATE 3

I&#39;m still trailing Asmodeus.

Logically, he has no reason to run. We don&#39;t call him the &#34;King of Beasts&#34; for nothing, you know? There&#39;s nothing to be afraid of, unless this is some kind of moon curse. I think that&#39;d be cool.

There&#39;s less skin in the gaps. I know there&#39;s been a lot of talk of Asmodeus&#39;s supposed healing factor, but this comes from scraping against trees, no?

... could he have been molting?

It occurs to me as I&#39;m writing this (and sorry for the stream of consciousness), but I really do wonder what it is I&#39;m looking for. Perhaps that&#39;s why I&#39;m //looking// for him, to know more. Good enough reason as any, it&#39;s... hard to leave the house these days, sometimes. But if that&#39;s the case, am I //really// hunting Asmodeus, or am I just looking for an excuse to get out and do something?

So how do I know I&#39;m doing something? How do I know if I&#39;m actually chasing Asmodeus?

... I don&#39;t know if it matters. At least I&#39;m trying, you know? 

...

,,I don&#39;t know if I even believe in him.,,

&gt; ##grey|**null**##

&gt; Why do you insist on ignoring me?
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;ve been telling you this isn&#39;t worth it the whole time! Just because you&#39;re bored, it doesn&#39;t give you a free pass to throw yourself into danger. You&#39;re messing with a literal, actual //demon//, and I&#39;ve been screaming this at you for //four days// now!
&gt; 
&gt; Turn! Back! Tell me you heard me, tell me to fuck off or thank me but //fuck&#39;s sake// don&#39;t keep me out in the cold!

&gt; ##grey|**null**##
&gt; ------
&gt; You know what, fine. If you&#39;re too stupid to heed my warnings then you deserve whatever Asmodeus gives you.

&gt; ##grey|**null**##

&gt; Whatever you&#39;re typing up, just be quick about it. Or have someone ban me, I honestly don&#39;t care anymore.

+ Update 4: I&#39;m not dead edition!

Holy //shit//, this goes deep.

So first of all, sorry for the wait! I just spent three days in a county jail before being released without charge. How crazy is //that//? It&#39;s like I&#39;m a real journalist!

Alright, so the hunt went... it really went. I spent a whole day (maybe two?) wandering in circles because this Asmodeus business is fucked up but my god, the things you //learn// about yourself. For example: did you know that when you don&#39;t sleep for a whole day, your body receives a huge burst of energy? It&#39;s true! I felt it.

This is all scatterbrained because the jailhouse let me buy coffee but I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;ve uncovered baby&#39;s first conspiracy! Get this: the park rangers are in on it!

So it&#39;s like midnight or something (and the stars were //really// beautiful) and I run into this park ranger. Now, this man was tall, bald, and smelled of rust, and also I&#39;m seeing him in the middle of the wild, so I&#39;m immediately on edge. Thankfully my phone&#39;s still got power (don&#39;t use it and charged a spare battery!) so I immediately begin recording.

&gt; **Ranger:** -be necessary, really. Now-
&gt; 
&gt; **Me:** Am I being detained?
&gt; 
&gt; **Ranger:** Ma&#39;am, that&#39;s... look, I&#39;m not a cop. I&#39;m a park ranger.
&gt; 
&gt; **Me:** Well, mister ranger, am I being detained?
&gt; 
&gt; **Ranger:** I... look, I need you to leave, alright?
&gt; 
&gt; **Me:** On what grounds?
&gt; 
&gt; **Ranger:** (//HIGHLY suspicious pause//) There&#39;s been a bit of a... wildlife problem, ma&#39;am. The, uh, park is closed.
&gt; 
&gt; **Me:** Wildlife? (//Ranger tries to interrupt me//) What //kind// of wildlife?
&gt; 
&gt; **Ranger:** Ma&#39;am, are you alright? You look a little... wobbly.
&gt; 
&gt; **Me:** I&#39;m perfectly fine, and that&#39;s beside the point. What kind of wildlife is prowling the park, huh?
&gt; 
&gt; //The ranger feigns a sigh at this point, likely to catch me off guard.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Ranger:** ... do you promise to walk with me if I tell you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Me:** What have you got to hide, officer? You&#39;re not covering up a visit from Asmodeus, King of Beasts, are you? Not some government g-man trying to keep us from the truth?
&gt; 
&gt; **Ranger:** Ma&#39;am, it&#39;s two in the morning, there&#39;s an ongoing wildlife issue, and you look like you&#39;re about to fall over. Look, just... come with me, I can tell you anything you want to know, but you need to come with me, alright?
&gt; 
&gt; **Me:** Hah. Nice try, but-
&gt; 
&gt; //I&#39;m cut off by the sound of something falling to the ground. The officers told me I &#34;passed out from dehydration&#34; at this point, but you can decide for yourself once I post the audio clip.//

I woke up in a jail cell with a //killer// headache. I&#39;m willing to bet they microchipped me, but I don&#39;t have enough money to check with a doctor. They gave me some bullshit story about a &#34;critically endangered apex predator&#34; or something along those lines. Couldn&#39;t even name the species, and that was when they were still answering my questions.

They&#39;re in on something and I //know// it. Why would they close the park in the wake of Asmodeus&#39;s most famous sighting if he didn&#39;t exist? Why wasn&#39;t the Trailhead Park closed, too? Why did the rangers collude with local police to keep me for the full 72 hours?

I&#39;ve got work coming up, so consider this the end of my battle with this mystery. But the war&#39;s not over, not even a little.

Keep your eyes peeled, Parawatch, and good night.
