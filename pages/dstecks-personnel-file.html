    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Name:** Dr. D█████ Stoeckle, codename &#34;DStecks&#34;
//**Note from O5-█:** Are you serious? His codename is// DStecks//? Does he think he&#39;s a [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] rapper? Let me have a look at this file. Looks like it needs some corrections.//
**Position:** Field research, Item acquisition.
**Security Clearance:** Level 2
**History:** A recent hire by the Foundation, Dr. Stoeckle graduated near the top of his class at MIT, but soon found himself confronted by his --antisocial tendencies-- enormous jackassery. While he worked for a time at the Smithsonian Institution, he was quickly fired. --The Smithsonian&#39;s personnel records-- Common sense shows that they ultimately decided that his talent was not worth his --inability to work as part of a team-- ego. As a result of his actions, the Smithsonian blacklisted him. He has had similar experiences with every other employer he has worked for, including DARPA, NASA, Microsoft, [DATA EXPUNGED], and Burger King. Thus, only the Foundation will employ him, and as such, he receives --10-- 50% less pay than a normal doctor of his rank.

--Dr. Stoeckle must not, under any circumstances, be assigned to a Mobile Task Force for any reason.-- Rescinded as per approval of P3-EAVESDROP.  

**Dr. Stoeckle was either responsible for the recovery or primary study of the following SCP items:**

[[[SCP-503]]]: The Luckiest Man in the World
[[[SCP-656]]]: Home Edition
[[[SCP-659]]]: Communal Avian Intelligence
[[[SCP-431]]]: Dr. Gideon
[[[SCP-620]]]: Time Keeps on Slipping
--SCP-086: Top Secret, Eyes Only--
[[[SCP-816]]]: Darwin&#39;s Erector Set
--SCP-601: Enlightenment--
[[[SCP-782]]]: All-New You
--SCP-1055: The Think Tank--
--SCP-3161: P3-EAVESDROP--

**Dr. Stoeckle has contributed to the study of the following SCP items:**
--SCP-242: The False Peacemaker--

**Dr. Stoeckle was responsible for documentation of the following events:**
