**Item #:** SCP-4717

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation Agents are to patrol beaches that are at a high risk of developing riptides. Watchtowers disguised as civilian commodities are to be built around areas where SCP-4717-1 instances frequent. After SCP-4717-1 instances have left the area, Class-A amnestics will be provided to witnesses. A disinformation campaign has been put in place to cover the events as a PSA campaign from a Foundation front company. The PSAs are to replicate SCP-4717 events exactly, with the shooting locations to be where SCP-4717-1 instances reside.

**Description:** SCP-4717 is an anomalous phenomon centered around the coastal areas of Australia, localized around the Eastern Coastline, stretching from Weipa, Queensland, to Melbourne, Victoria. The anomaly only activates if three certain conditions are met:

* The location is within 300 metres of a beach area.
* The location has a history of high profile drownings (specifically relating to riptides).
* The location features a human currently caught in a riptide event.

Once these conditions are met, humanoid entities will manifest (designated SCP-4717-1), usually in a pair. SCP-4717-1 are humanoids resembling young adults in swimwear. These entities hold large signs that resemble gloved human hands, pointing either to the left or the right of the beach. Approximately 3 seconds after manifesting, they will proceed to the edge of the shoreline. After locating the person caught in the riptide, they will call out to the drowning individual, repeating the phrase: &#34;To escape a rip, swim parallel to the beach!&#34;

If the drowning individual notices the humanoids during this time, they will automatically understand the context and the instructions given to them, regardless whether the individual can physically hear the SCP-4717-1 instances. The individual will then swim along the coastline, eventually escaping the riptide and getting to safety. After the individual is confirmed to be no longer at risk of drowning, the instances will exit the immediate area and demanifest.

In all documented cases, there have been a total of eight fatalities during SCP-4717 events, despite the presence of SCP-4717-1. 

**Addendum SCP-4717-A:** During the manifestation of SCP-4717-1 instances, one humanoid noticed a Foundation agent (now designated SCP-4717-L), and fled the scene early, prompting a pursuit and capture for interrogation. The second humanoid demanifested before agents could apprehend and detain.

&gt; **Interviewed:**SCP-4717-L
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr.█████
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;** 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████:**  Alright, and we are live. Just so you know, this will be transcribed and recorded live for the records, is that alright?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4717-L:** Oh, yeah yeah, that&#39;s fine. You&#39;re not gonna put my real name out there though, right? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████:** No, your name will be censored, along with your voice. I wouldn&#39;t be able to pick you from a crowd.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Doctor █████ pulls out a notepad and places it on the table.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████:** Right, so first things first. What&#39;s your name? 
&gt; 
&gt; //(SCP-4717-L hunches over and rubs his temples.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4717-L:**  Uhh... It&#39;s ██████████. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████:**  ██████████? Weird, but okay.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4717-L:** Hey, can you not, like, say stuff like that? It may be silly, but at least it&#39;s unique!
&gt; 
&gt; //(Dr. █████ scribbles down on his notepad.)//
&gt; 
&gt;  **Dr. █████**: Sorry, I just haven&#39;t heard a name like that before, is it Greek?
&gt; 
&gt; //(SCP-4717-L chuckles.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4717-L:** If only it was! I&#39;m actually from Walloongoong.[[footnote]] This is presumed to be [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wollongong| Wollongong]]], a city in New South Wales, Australia. [[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt;  **Dr. █████:** Oh, really? I&#39;m from there too.
&gt; 
&gt;  **SCP-4717-L:** What!? Oh fuck yeah! We got another Gong&#39;r! 
&gt; 
&gt; //(SCP-4717-L goes for a high five, which Dr. █████ reciprocates.)//
&gt; 
&gt;  **SCP-4717-L:** Man, it&#39;s so good to see someone from my town! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████:** Same here, man! But we going slightly off topic. What if we talked after this, huh?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4717-L:** Yeah, that would be awesome!
&gt; 
&gt; //(Dr. █████ flips a page of his notepad.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████:** To be honest, there&#39;s only one question I need to ask you. What is it that you do exactly? Like do you work for someone, or is it just you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4717-L:** Oh, is that it? I can give you a few details, but the rest you&#39;ll have to talk to my manager about, he knows more than me. I&#39;ll give you his details. Can I borrow that notepad?
&gt; 
&gt; //(Doctor █████ pushes the audio tape closer, and gives his notepad to SCP-4717-L, who talks whilst writing.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4717-L:** Truth is, I work for a company, Sorl&#39;s Surfing and Lifesavers&#39; Club. And while I really want to be a lifeguard, I can&#39;t swim very well, shows what school does for ya!
&gt; 
&gt; //(SCP-4717-L laughs for a brief moment).//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4717-L:** Oh man, I hated high school. But anyway, instead of throwing my dreams away like a fuckwit, I decided to save people another way, with signs! Now I can&#39;t tell you how they work, but I can say that they work tremendously well! I just hope I can keep my job here, it&#39;s a competitive business.
&gt; 
&gt; //(SCP-4717-L pulls out an ID card from its breast pocket and hands it to Dr. █████, along with the notepad.)//
&gt; 
&gt;  **SCP-4717-L:** Aaaand there we are, here&#39;s my ID, in case they ask, and my managers number. Just ring him up, he’ll help you with anything you ask. You need anything else?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████:** No, that&#39;s actually pretty good, thanks for this! The police should escort you out soon, I&#39;ll meet you outside. 
&gt; 
&gt;  **SCP-4717-L:** Nice! I&#39;ll be sure to wait for you!
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** SCP-4717-L demanifested after exiting the interview room. --After extensive testing, the number and ID given by SCP-4717-L were proven to be falsified, as the phone company that used 04████████ had it discontinued in 1976, due to electrical problems in Southern Queensland. The ID provided was a falsified using a photo from an Australian PSA by the company █████ ████ ██████ ██████████, and the credentials were not found on all major public and private databases.-- [SEE ADDENDUM SCP-4717-B FOR DETAILS (21/5/2009)]

**Addendum SCP-4717-B:** On the 21/5/2009[[footnote]] It is noted that this occured two weeks after the latest itieration of the containment procedures were enacted.[[/footnote]], Dr. █████ received an unauthorized call during his shift break. The caller (now designated as SCP-4717-M) introduced them as a legal representative of Sorl&#39;s Surfing and Lifesavers&#39; Club, and described events relating to SCP-4717-1 instances.  The following is the conversation after the cell phone&#39;s automatic record function was activated.


[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Interview SCP-4717-B&#34; hide=&#34;- Close Interview SCP-4717-B&#34;]]


&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-4717-M
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. █████
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4717-M:** Now you know the severe consequences that come with this, don&#39;t you? Using other people&#39;s intellectual property without a single ounce of regret or remorse? Dr. █████, this is a very serious situation we have here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████:** I know that you are clearly upset by this, but you must know that I didn&#39;t do anything. I wasn&#39;t a part of the meeting, nor did I film the ads. I merely authorized it.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4717-M:** Oh, stop lying Dr. █████, you were present at the shooting locations from day one! You were the one that authorized it, you were the one that was present at those locations, and you were the one that filmed these adverts, did you not!?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████:** Well, yes I did, bu-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4717-M:** And that is exactly why I&#39;m talking to you! You were the director, and therefore you were responsible for the broadcasting of these adverts. You knew what the consequences of infringing on the Sorl&#39;s company was, and yet you decided to go ahead and the green light it anyway!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████:** No, no no no, you can&#39;t just sue us! How do you even know my name, anyway?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4717-M:** Oh, your name? I got it from that from the kid you held against, which is another charge that will be filed. Christ, the kid&#39;s shaken, y&#39;know? He hasn&#39;t been at work since.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Both parties remain silent for a few seconds. A loud sigh is heard from SCP-4717-M&#39;s end.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4717-M:** Look, I don&#39;t wanna do this. I don&#39;t want to have to go through all the paperwork and the fees, not to mention the fine you guys would end up dishing out afterwards. All we ask, is that you take down the adverts, and let us make our own. We promise to make them as best as we can. That will be all. Goodbye.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Shortly after the call was disconnected, Dr. █████ requested the temporary discontinuation of all broadcasts pertaining to SCP-4717, which was approved. Several days later, non anomalous advertisements featuring multiple SCP-4717-1 instances were aired. Investigations into the Sorls company are currently underway.
