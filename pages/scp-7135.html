**Item #:** SCP-7135

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7135 is contained within a reinforced steel structure appropriate to its size, fitted with a full monitoring suite. For concealment purposes, this containment unit is disguised as a perennially out-of-service public bathroom, preventing civilians from accessing it while giving Foundation researchers easy access. At least two Foundation security personnel equipped with field amnestics are to remain in the area, either in a nearby safehouse fitted for this purpose or patrolling the surrounding area, at all times. SCP-7135 is effectively self-containing, although its location causes difficulty in concealing it from the public and properly running tests.

**Description:** SCP-7135 is a cube, 67cm on the side, located in Square Marigny, in the Champs-Élysées in Paris, France. It is invisible, does not make noise when touched, does not have a heat signature differing from the ambient temperature, and can otherwise not be detected by any test beyond physical contact from an object or individual. All tests performed on the cube so far have been unable to alter its position, size, or shape, or damage it in any way, although its location has limited the Foundation’s ability to perform tests on it.

SCP-7135 contains the remains of Jeanne Martin, a local street performer who, in life, acted as a mime, and was at the moment of recovery dressed in such a manner. Investigations have not found any evidence that Jeanne Martin was previously associated with any anomalous organization or had anomalous properties herself prior to her entombment within SCP-7135. These remains could be identified when SCP-7135 was first located and contained by the French branch of the Foundation, but seem to have rotted since; due to an impossibility to penetrate SCP-7135, the Foundation has been unable to retrieve these remains or perform anything beyond the most superficial tests on them. All that remains is a still brown pool with a seemingly full, adult human skeleton within it, alongside tatters of Jeanne Martin’s costume, her wallet- detected at one point by the monitoring equipment, contents not entirely certain- and her keychain- again, detected by the monitoring equipment, exact details unknown.

SCP-7135 was found on September 3rd, 2021, after the Foundation tapped into reports to Paris’ emergency services that a mime had been “trapped in plexiglass”. Personnel were deployed and amnestics were administered to the witnesses; attempts to relocate SCP-7135 were made, but after such efforts were met with repeated failure it was quickly decided it would be most expedient to build a containment structure around it instead. Between the time emergency services were contacted and the time Foundation personnel arrived on scene, twelve minutes had passed; Jeanne Martin was unresponsive at the time, and her appearance suggested an advanced stage of oxygen deprivation, thus she was declared tentatively dead. Jeanne Martin was identified through the interrogation of other local street artists, alongside comparisons of pictures of her with the still-fresh remains. Her family were told that she had been run over by a truck, and offered a properly damaged corpse belonging to a D-class employee of similar build who had happened to die some days prior and was still under Foundation property, for them to bury.

A temporary containment unit, consisting of a heavily monitored tarp tent, was erected soon after recovery to conceal SCP-7135 until the permanent containment unit finished construction. The permanent containment unit finished construction on September 28th, 2021.

**Experiment Logs:**

Due to ongoing concerns on anonymity and deniability, no names have been added.

&gt; **Date:** 2023/09/03
&gt; **Test description:** Attempt by an unenhanced adult human male to repeatedly push and kick SCP-7135. This test was performed by the initial response team.
&gt; **Test results:** Repeated pushes and kicks reportedly failed to damage or move SCP-7135.

&gt; **Date:** 2023/09/03
&gt; **Test description:** Attempt to breach SCP-7135 with a pneumatic drill.
&gt; **Test results:** After 4 hours of drilling, no progress was made.

&gt; **Date:** 2023/09/03
&gt; **Test description:** Attempt to move SCP-7135 by tying it up with chains and having a Foundation-owned TRM 10000 truck attempt to pull it away.
&gt; **Test results:** The truck failed to move SCP-7135.

&gt; **Date:** 2023/09/03
&gt; **Test description:** Attempt to breach SCP-7135 with 30cL of sulfuric acid.
&gt; **Test results:** The acid was poured on top of SCP-7135. It was cleaned off after 30 minutes, so as to not interfere with the containment unit’s construction process. No damage was observed on SCP-7135, nor was any effect observed on Jeanne Martin’s remains, although this test provided initial proof that SCP-7135 is capable of holding liquids as well as any non-anomalous flat surface.

&gt; **Date:** 2023/09/03
&gt; **Test description:** Attempt to breach SCP-7135 through the use of fire.
&gt; **Test results:** A bonfire was started around the cube and left to act for two minutes. Jeanne Martin’s remains started to broil within the cube, at which point the fire was put out. No damage was observed on SCP-7135, although the test proved satisfactorily that SCP-7135 does not prevent the spread of heat.

&gt; **Date:** 2023/09/03
&gt; **Test description:** Attempt to breach SCP-7135 through the use of a DM-51 fragmentation grenade
&gt; **Test results:** Test was not performed due to concerns over detonating high explosives in an urban park. Proposing researcher was reprimanded.

&gt; **Date:** 2023/09/03
&gt; **Test description:** Attempt to cover and uncover SCP-7135 with a cloth sheet to test its interaction with the trappings of stage magic
&gt; **Test results:** After several attempts at covering and uncovering SCP-7135, with variations on poise, pull angle, and intonations of wonder and amazement (such as “voilá” and “huzzah”), the test was deemed a failure. A hole was located on the cloth sheet, seemingly caused by a chemical burn; it was inferred at first that SCP-7135 might have corrosive properties, but it was quickly determined that some sulfuric acid from a previous test had not been properly disposed of. SCP-7135 was cleaned once again, more thoroughly this time.

&gt; **Date:** 2023/09/28
&gt; **Test description:** Attempt to test SCP-7135’s resistance to radiation through the use of a specially mounted lead cover, a sample of radioactive material, and a Geiger counter. The lead cover would be able to block radiation from moving around SCP-7135, only allowing it to attempt to move through it; thus, if the Geiger counter placed on the other side detected radiation, definitive proof could be obtained on whether or not SCP-7135 blocks radiation. This was the first test run in the permanent containment unit.
&gt; **Test result:** The Geiger counter did not pick up any nonstandard radiation from the cube itself. When the test was run, the Geiger counter detected the expected amount of radiation from the sample. The test was deemed a success.

&gt; **Date:** 2023/09/28
&gt; **Test description:** Attempt to breach SCP-7135 through the use of a DM-51 fragmentation grenade
&gt; **Test results:** Test was not performed due to concerns over detonating high explosives in an urban park. Proposing researcher was reprimanded.

&gt; **Date:** 2023/09/28
&gt; **Test description:** Attempt to test SCP-7135’s conductivity of sound and other vibrations through the use of a specially mounted soundproof shell, a microphone, a hammer and the testing researcher’s phone playlist
&gt; **Test results:** SCP-7135 did not allow sound to travel through it, nor did it conduct vibrations from being struck with a hammer.</textarea></pre>
