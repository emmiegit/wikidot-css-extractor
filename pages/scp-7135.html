**Item #:** SCP-7135

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-7135 is to be held in a standard containment locker at site 98.

**Description:** SCP-7135 appears to be a printing press of the same model used to mint dollar bills in the United states, with a number of distinct differences. The modifications include a metal funnel measuring 3 meters in diameter at the top with a hole in the bottom 2 meters in diameter, connecting to a cube-shaped protrusion, 2.5 meters on each side. The opening at the bottom of the funnel leads to two rows of circular saw blades. SCP-7135 does not appear to have any sort of input or control such as buttons or levers, nor does it have a plug with which to connect it to any power source, or a way to feed paper into it. The words &#34;Meat goes here&#34; are written in marker on the outer surface of the funnel.   

When a person is placed inside the funnel of SCP-7135 the machine will automatically activate, causing the saw blades to spin rapidly, terminating the individual. The machine then prints an amount of money that varies from individual to individual, but seems to be inversely correlated with the subject&#39;s age. The currency which the machine prints is always that of an individual&#39;s native country.

Certain individuals, such as the unemployed, or extremely old individuals, have caused SCP-7135 to create an amount of &#34;negative-value&#34; bills. Thee bills conform to the style of the state currency of the individual&#39;s country of origin, but contain original designs and portraits of currently unidentified individuals. 


**Recovery Log:** SCP-7135 was recovered from an Amazon warehouse in █████████, Texas after multiple employees were reported missing. It was found that the regional manager of the warehouse had been subjecting underperforming employees to the effects of 7135 . Amnestics were applied to individuals aware of SCP-7135 , and the manager was reported to local authorities, under the cover story of him being a non-anomalous serial killer. A note was found in his desk relating to SCP-7135 

**Recovered Documentation:** 
&gt; Let&#39;s cut out the middle man
&gt; 
&gt; This is what it&#39;s always been about
&gt; 
&gt; With this device you rule the world
&gt; 
&gt; Are We Cool Yet?
