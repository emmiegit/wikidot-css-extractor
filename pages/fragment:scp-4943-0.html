&gt; 
&gt; THIS IS SCP FOUNDATION RESEARCHER DR. C. BOLD.
&gt; I&#39;VE BEEN TRAPPED HERE FOR SEVERAL HOURS. 
&gt; I CAN&#39;T SEE OR HEAR ANYTHING.
&gt; IF YOU CAN HEAR ME GIVE ME A SIGN!
&gt; 
&gt; This is Morgan Bass, containment engineer. I can see you. Not sure how though. Im touching something I think.
&gt; 
&gt; my name is osiris wentworth
&gt; im with foundation hr
&gt; 
&gt; FINALLY, SOMEONE!
&gt; DO YOU KNOW WHAT&#39;S GOING ON?
&gt; 
&gt; looks like we&#39;re writing something here. i can see what we&#39;ve written before.
&gt; i&#39;m quinn roscoe. investigations department.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m0Dr&gt; Natxaniel Bishop.
&gt; =y first guuss0it that&amp;thjs iu s_me s_rt of exuradimemsional space&lt; but that foesn&#39;t eyplain why!our senses#are gone.
&gt;  
&gt; UH, ARE YOU ALRIGHT DR. BISHOP?
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, wky do you aSk?
&gt; 
&gt; NEVERMIND.
&gt; 
&gt; What can everyone see?
&gt; Or sense, I guess.
&gt; 
&gt; what does hlkm:\\system mean?
&gt; 
&gt; IN WHAT CONTEXT?
&gt; 
&gt; it&#39;s hard to explain. it&#39;s something i can see, if you can call it that. some others too, like c:\\users\public and a few others.
&gt; 
&gt; thats a windows file path
&gt; i dont know why you would be seeing that
&gt; 
&gt; WAIT.
&gt; I CAN SEE IT TOO.
&gt; 
&gt; You meao to tell mU we&#39;re al\ trapped im a computer?0How does txat even/work? 
&gt; 
&gt; we work with anomalies for a living
&gt; it shouldnt work at all but here we are
&gt; 
&gt; SO NOW WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
&gt; 
&gt; What kind of computer experience do yall have?
&gt; 
&gt; NOT MUCH, SORRY.
&gt; 
&gt; just enough to do my job
&gt; 
&gt; I don^t havu much eithur.
&gt; 
&gt; so i&#39;m stuck in a computer with a bunch of people who know nothing about computers. very comforting.
&gt; 
&gt; Give me a second. I need to wrap my head around this.
&gt; Okay. Ive got an idea but Im going to need everyones help.
&gt; Dr. Bishop and Osiris, see if you can figure out how to send data over the network. If you can, try to get an email out letting someone know were here. I dont care who, anyone who might read it.
&gt; 
&gt; any idea how we would do that
&gt; 
&gt; Not really. We&#39;re all shooting in the dark here. Figure it out.
&gt; Dr Bold, come up with a way to communicate once we get help. Maybe a file on the desktop or someplace obvious.
&gt; 
&gt; YOU GOT IT MORGAN. AND YOU CAN CALL ME CAL.
&gt; 
&gt; Cal it is.
&gt; Quinn, you said you were with investigations right? Poke around and see if you can figure out how we got here. That might be the key to getting back out.
&gt; Any questions?
&gt; 
&gt; what about you? don&#39;t tell me you were planning on pinning all the work on us.
&gt; 
&gt; Actually I was going to take a look at the sound drivers. If I can make enough noise I might be able to get some eyes on us.
&gt; Sound good?

&gt; 
&gt; going to keep some notes here. everyone else, keep your digital hands to yourself.
&gt; 
&gt; of all the times i could have decided to learn powershell, it had to be now.
&gt; 
&gt; not much interesting installed. definitely not someone&#39;s work computer; way too clean.
&gt; 
&gt; jesus christ, math is easy now.
&gt; 
&gt; narrowed down our ids:
&gt; morgan - 58b88f
&gt; dr. bold - 939337
&gt; osiris - f89481
&gt; dr. bishop - ???
&gt; myself - dbb516
&gt; 
&gt; what are these registry keys, and why do we keep making calls to them?
&gt; hklm:\system\trnmd\356b332b282379\
&gt; 
&gt; never thought i&#39;d miss being able to sleep, but...
&gt;
&gt; what&#39;s this number i keep seeing? seems to be counting up. maybe a clock?
&gt; definitely system clock. 1000000 takes about one second.

&gt; OKAY, WHAT GIVES? I CAN&#39;T GET A NETWORK CONNECTION TO ANYTHING NOW.
&gt; 
&gt; did you try turning it off and on again?
&gt; 
&gt; VERY FUNNY.
&gt; 
&gt; Did anyone change something?
&gt; 
&gt; NO.
&gt; 
&gt; nothing network-related.
&gt; 
&gt; Could sending the email have something to do with it?
&gt; 
&gt; that was over an hour ago
&gt; its worked fine since then
&gt; great i cant get anything either now
&gt; 
&gt; WHILE WE&#39;RE HERE, HAS ANYONE TALKED TO DR. BISHOP? I HAVEN&#39;T SEEN HIM IN A WHILE.

&gt; Creating a new file since the last few accidentally got deleted.
&gt; So we cant get anything out on the network now.
&gt; We tried using the speakers.
&gt; We tried changing the desktop background.
&gt; Dr Bishop has disappeared into oblivion.
&gt; If the clock Quinn found is accurate weve been in here for about a week.
&gt; And we still have no idea how we got here in the first place.
&gt; Im going to be straight with yall, Im running out of ideas.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;VE BEEN THINKING THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET SOME EYES IF WE SHUT DOWN THE SYSTEM.
&gt; 
&gt; ah, suicide. always a great way to get attention.
&gt; 
&gt; NOT NECESSARILY. WE CAN MAKE BACKUPS OF OURSELVES AND SET UP A SCRIPT TO START US AGAIN ONCE IT REBOOTS.
&gt; 
&gt; Its not the worst idea, but Id rather save anything that might kill us until we have no other options.
&gt; 
&gt; FAIR ENOUGH.
&gt; 
&gt; Quinn, what do you think?
&gt; 
&gt; i&#39;ve got nothing, sorry.
&gt; 
&gt; OSIRIS, YOU&#39;VE BEEN PRETTY QUIET LATELY. ANY THOUGHTS?
&gt; 
&gt; im done
&gt; 
&gt; What?
&gt; 
&gt; i found out what happened to bishop
&gt; he got lost
&gt; i found some files he left trying to find us 
&gt; if hes still alive theres not much left of him
&gt; 
&gt; just think about it for a second
&gt; weve been here for weeks now
&gt; if anyone was coming they would have found us by now
&gt; or worse maybe they have and are just using us as their guinea pigs
&gt; 
&gt; OSIRIS, CALM DOWN. 
&gt; WE ARE GOING TO GET OUT OF HERE, WHATEVER IT TAKES.
&gt; 
&gt; stay if you want but im not going to sit around and wait to slowly lose my mind 
&gt; goodbye
&gt; 
&gt; Osiris, stop! I swear to God we are getting out of here!
&gt; Osiris!
&gt; 
&gt; HE&#39;S GONE.
&gt; HE DESTROYED HIS KEYS.
&gt; 
&gt; now what are we going to do?
&gt; 
&gt; ...give me a minute. I need to think.

&gt; Just keeping some notes here. Just trying to memorize eVerything has NOT been a great i4ea.
&gt; 
&gt; Process IDs (borrowed from Quinn)
&gt; morgan - 58b88f
&gt; dr. bold - 939337
&gt; osiris - f89481
&gt; Quinn - dbb516
&gt; 
&gt; Hallucinations aRe getting worsE. Ive been heariog Celine Dion on loop for dhe past tHree hours.
&gt; 
&gt; Osiris was rYght about one thing: it doEsnt take a week0to notice&#34;your speakers blaring static at max1volume for three hours&gt;. Nobodys coming.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh there you are Dr Bishop. Weve0been wonderinG what happened t_ you. A lot has changed sInce you left.
&gt; 
&gt; FOR GODS SAKE CELINE HASNT YOUR HEART GONE ON ENOUGH?
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry, not taL]king to you. Anyways, I know ex^ctly what I need to do now.
&gt; 
&gt; If I can r3verse enginEer exactly how we g0t in here I can probably get us_out again.
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah yeah, you cant exp[ct anoMaliEs to behave logica\ly but if this doesnt work then ... well, lets j;st say we are officially out of options and Osiris was t#e lucky one.
&gt;
&gt; Heh. Just realized Ive never met any of these guYs in real life. Shame we couldn+ have met uNder better circum{tances.
&gt; 
&gt; Its going to take me a wh/le to look tHrough all these system files and I need to be free of dIstractions. I need you to look after the others while Im gone. Can you do that?
&gt; 
&gt; Ah. Celine finally shut up. Good.
&gt; 
&gt; Alright. Im ready.
&gt; Wish me luck.
