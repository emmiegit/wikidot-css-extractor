&gt; Dear Mom,
&gt; 
&gt; I suppose I should open with &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m sorry for all the fights that lead up to this. I&#39;m sorry for stealing your credit card and buying a Greyhound ticket to New York. I&#39;m sorry for abandoning you, Carlos, and Mima just as her health started to decline. For all this and everything else I have done, I am sorry. I hope you can one day forgive me.
&gt; 
&gt; Ever since I told you I was not quite who you wanted me to be I have felt a growing rift between us. Your unconditional love kept coming with more and more conditions and I just couldn&#39;t take it anymore. I was tired of everything being &#39;because you said so&#39;. I had to do what was best for me, even if it meant leaving everything behind for a second time. I was ready for this ever since I left Havana.
&gt; 
&gt; That&#39;s why I bought myself a one-way ticket out of here. It wasn&#39;t easy to come to this decision, I&#39;ll have you know. Despite everything you put me through I still love you. Hell, I can&#39;t even say in good conscience that I&#39;ll forget all about you.  I&#39;ll think of you every time I meet a new person I don&#39;t like and remember to be kind to them, no matter what. I&#39;ll think of Carlos every time I open a new book to read, just like how I used to read to him when he was small. I&#39;ll think of Mima every time I eat and remember to finish my plate because someone out there doesn&#39;t have anything, even if I&#39;m already full. I will remember you all as long as I live.
&gt; 
&gt; I know you&#39;re probably mad at me for spending money you don&#39;t have on something so selfish, which I totally understand. I left for my own health, which I hope you may one day understand. But even if you don&#39;t, that&#39;s okay too. It&#39;ll all be okay eventually. Just like you used to say; everything gets better with time. As soon as I get a job and get paid I will send you the cash for my use of your credit card with a little interest. 
&gt; 
&gt; There&#39;s so much more I want to say but the post office is closing soon and I need to go.
&gt; 
&gt; Love from New York,
&gt; Your Eldest
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; P.S.: The view from my partner&#39;s apartment is amazing. I&#39;ve never felt more at home.
