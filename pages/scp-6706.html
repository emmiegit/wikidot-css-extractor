&gt; ++ SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES
[[/=]]

SCP-6706 is, at present, not containable. Foundation containment operations thus prioritize minimization of disruptive effects to normalcy as a consequence of SCP-6706 events and rendering medical aid to those directly harmed by such occurrences. In circumstances where public knowledge of SCP-6706 cannot be reasonably prevented, airborne dispersion of Class-B amnestic agents along with the implementation of an appropriate cover story is authorized. Typically, the most successful of these reference uncontrolled flooding (due to pipes bursting or similar occurrences) and the subsequent controlled demolition of the structure for insurance reasons. Personnel known to have witnessed any part of an SCP-6706 event, be it the prelude, the event itself, or the aftermath, are to be apprehended by Foundation field agents, interrogated, and administered a Class-B amnestic. 

The Foundation maintains three structures, designated Areas 6706-A through 6706-C, confirmed to have been filled with saltwater as a consequence of an SCP-6706 manifestation. Other structures significantly isolated from civilian populations may be acquired by the Foundation and similarly maintained once clearance from O5 Command has been granted. Constant repair work outside and within these structures is to be completed exclusively by D-Class teams comprised of no more than four (4) individuals each due to potentially hazardous conditions. Dive teams must maintain continuous radio contact with a remote &#34;Control&#34; team and complete their assigned repair tasks without delay or distraction. Failure to establish radio contact with any member of a dive team is cause for an immediate mission abort, with all missing dive team members presumed KIA. 

Mobile Task Force 951-Gamma (&#34;Scuba Squad&#34;) has been established due to circumstances surrounding a potential secondary anomalous effect within structures affected SCP-6706. All structures confirmed to have been affected by SCP-6706 are to be thoroughly investigated by MTF 951-Gamma before destruction or containment. MTF 951-Gamma is to comply with the same regulations and protocols applicable to D-Class dive teams. Data collected from these explorations is to be submitted to O5 Command for the purpose of reviewing SCP-6706&#39;s classification and nature.

&gt; ++ DESCRIPTION
[[/=]]

SCP-6706 designates a poorly understood spatial phenomenon in which a confined space can abruptly become filled[[footnote]]In cases where a structure is open or otherwise not entirely enclosed, it will instead contain water rising to the highest point of a connected wall or surface.[[/footnote]] with large quantities of seawater. Generally, the amount of seawater that manifests as a consequence of a SCP-6706 event either matches or exceeds the volume of the affected room, structure, or enclosed area. While the seawater itself is not noticeably distinct from that which would be found in saltwater bodies of water throughout Earth, the manner in which it appears is physically anomalous; there are no obvious signs of structural penetration, nor any obvious sources from which the water originated. The initial SCP-6706 event does not necessarily threaten structural damage to the space in which it manifests, though materials that degrade or otherwise weaken in the presence of saltwater will be affected in a manner consistent with exposure to non-anomalous saltwater. Testing of water connected to SCP-6706 has revealed that it contains microorganisms and waste matter consistent with the presence of marine life.

While the cause of SCP-6706 events remains nebulous, eyewitnesses in close proximity to structures affected by the anomaly report several phenomena prior, during, and immediately after the manifestation of the water. The most consistent of these is the description of a &#34;low, humming noise&#34; audible for roughly five to ten minutes prior to the beginning of a SCP-6706 event, variably described as &#34;animal-like,&#34; &#34;disconcerting,&#34; and &#34;childish.&#34; A less commonly reported but frequently cited observation, often seen in tandem with the phenomenon described above, is the presence of entities that remain animate despite total submersion for extended periods, exhibiting awareness of those outside the structure or otherwise behaving inconsistently with affected civilians in close proximity. 

The nature of SCP-6706, along with its apparent &#34;preference&#34; for structures in densely populated areas, renders its effect on civilian personnel frequently catastrophic. Any occupants of a structure affected by SCP-6706 will likely drown unless immediately adjacent to an exit or means of exiting the building. The excess weight provided to an affected building by SCP-6706&#39;s seawater quickly results in a variety of detrimental effects to the structure&#39;s integrity; floors may collapse upon each other, elevators may become stuck or otherwise inoperable, stairways will become flooded, and support pillars will begin cracking or swaying as they succumb to gradual loss of solidity. Should an affected building collapse, all internal seawater and any individual in direct contact with it will vanish, leaving no trace of SCP-6706 related phenomena. 

The contents of SCP-6706&#39;s water vary wildly and are rarely held constant across successive manifestations. In the majority of cases (53%), no contents save for aquatic microorganisms and marine life waste will be detected. The second most likely case (25%) involves the presence of human cadavers, often with appearances matching those of previous SCP-6706 victims, reported to intermittently exhibit muscle spasms or other slight movements when in close proximity to living subjects. The most improbable case (13%) incorporates the manifestation of a set of unidentified entities collectively designated SCP-6706-01. Eyewitnesses report that these individuals are ████████ ████████, often bearing a strong resemblance to ██████ ██████ ##white|{{FURTHER INFORMATION EXPUNGED BY ORDER OF O5 COMMAND.}}##

&gt; ++ DISCOVERY
[[/=]]

Initial reports of SCP-6706 date to Renaissance-era Europe, sporadically being referenced as a &#34;sudden flood&#34; and the &#34;blue death.&#34; It was initially believed to be a judgment from the Christian God cast upon those who violated Christian moral doctrine, a belief that was reinforced extensively by SCP-6706 frequently manifesting in prisons or structures that were densely populated relative to their volume, such as brothels and schools. Those who attempted to study SCP-6706 during this period did not differentiate between natural bodies of water and the anomaly, believing the latter to simply be an extension of the former and all land to exist &#34;at the behest&#34; of water. Some regions developed high levels of paranoia concerning SCP-6706 and would attempt to prevent its appearance through the construction of open or otherwise non-enclosed buildings, which had no effect on the probability of an SCP-6706 event occurring. 

An unnamed resident of Venice wrote of the flooding of a building between 1350 and 1375, noting that the appearance of the water did not appear to coincide with any leaks or structural damage. While related structural incidents were common given the presence of water throughout the city, journal entries suggest that this particular event was seen as abnormal from the beginning, largely due to surrounding phenomenon and general superstition. The resident further mentions that an inspection of the building following its collapse showed no obvious signs of water related damage and that all former occupants were subsequently reported missing. Later journal entries written by the same resident report the presence of &#34;water-logged corpses&#34; in recurring visions as well as their presence in buildings unaffected by SCP-6706. 

Notably, most if not all historical records involving SCP-6706 suggest that its victims are recognizable to the party documenting the event, either vaguely (in the form of a general acquaintance) or specifically (in the form of close friends or family members). This occurs even when the victims of the event in question possessing those identities is impossible, either due to their passing, their distance from the affected structure, or some other extenuating factor. Generally, victims are described as █████ █████ ███████████.

&gt; ++ ADDENDUM I: INTERVIEW 6706-01
[[/=]]

The following interview was conducted following a confirmed manifestation of SCP-6706 in the Museum of Natural History, located in New York, New York. Jacob Morrison, a guest at the museum, was affected by SCP-6706 but managed to escape due to being near the entrance at the beginning of the event. 

&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** Thanks for waiting, Jacob. I was talking to a few of the guys outside, and they mentioned you were cold, so -- here. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Dr. Pogan hands Jacob a plastic cup containing hot tea.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** It&#39;s mint. Hope that&#39;s alright.
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrison:** Yeah. Yeah, thanks.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** How are you feeling? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrison:** My chest hurts. It&#39;s burning. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** I see. How bad is the pain, would you say? 1-10. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrison:** It&#39;s...hard to describe. It comes in waves. It&#39;s not a constant thing. I&#39;ll be fine one minute, y&#39;know -- talking to you, and then, it just feels like I&#39;m back there. Struggling to breathe. //[Morrison gestures to his chest.]// It feels like there&#39;s still water in there. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** Well, rest assured, we took a quick look at you when we brought you in and you&#39;re fine. Nothing to worry about. Let&#39;s start at the beginning -- was there anything odd when you first arrived at the museum? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrison:** No. Seemed normal. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Dr. Pogan writes something down in his notes, but Morrison gestures to get his attention.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrison:** Actually, wait -- there was this...I don&#39;t know, humming? It sounded like a machine. Or an animal. I didn&#39;t think anything of it. It&#39;s New York, you hear weird shit all the time, but yeah -- it was definitely there. Loud as hell, too.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** Did anyone else with you notice this? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrison:** We all did. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** Seems like the sort of thing somebody would at least look into, don&#39;t you think? Do you remember seeing any police? Anyone checking it out? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrison:** Maybe. I don&#39;t know. There are police all over New York anyway. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** So, walk me through this. You get there, you hear this humming, and then what? You go straight into the museum? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrison:** That&#39;s right. My friends and I were really excited -- it was our first time in the city. We went straight to the dinosaur area, since Sarah wouldn&#39;t shut up about it. Wanted to see a velociraptor. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** Any signs of flooding or water damage at that point? No leaks, wet floors? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrison:** No. Bone dry. I guess maybe there were a couple spills but nothing caused by -- what happened. Everything looked perfectly normal. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Morrison clutches his chest again.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrison:** Sorry, pain&#39;s back. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** It&#39;s alright. Take your time. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Morrison relaxes for a moment before taking a sip of the tea. The pain seems to subside somewhat.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrison:** We were a few steps from the dinosaur exhibit. I remember hearing kids over there laugh and scream, parents yelling at them to come back. Typical stuff. And then everyone looked up at the ceiling, all at once. There was this groaning, or -- more of a creaking. We all heard it. Everyone was silent. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** Was it coming from the ceiling? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrison:** It seemed to be, but there was nothing //wrong// with the ceiling. No cracks, no breaks, nothing. It was perfectly fine, but...I&#39;ve never heard a place that quiet. It was dead silent except for that noise.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** And that&#39;s when, as you told police, the water started coming in? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrison:** Yeah. That&#39;s when it happened. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Morrison pauses for a moment, exhaling sharply.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrison:** You know, I don&#39;t actually remember water //coming// in. I just...I just remember the water. I remember my eyes stinging. I looked around, and everyone was floating. Sarah and her friends were panicking. Nobody knew what was going on. I don&#39;t even think it registered for us that we were underwater at first, and I could hear them screaming -- this muffled, gurgling scream, like they weren&#39;t even processing that they were drowning. But, uh -- 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** Was anyone able to escape? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrison:** No. Not before me. I think a couple people were near the door but they seemed to go the quickest. Not sure why. Every time I looked around, there were more bodies. It was -- fuck, I can&#39;t believe I even think this. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** What? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrison:** It was almost peaceful. Beautiful. Hair in the water, clothes waving slightly. I remember seeing this one woman. She had the most gorgeous red hair, perfectly waving around in the water. But she wasn&#39;t moving. Somebody bumped into her while trying to swim to the ceiling. It made her turn to face me, and I looked at her. She was so cold. There was nothing there. There was nothing left. She was dead, but -- but she was still screaming --  
&gt; 
&gt; //[He grabs his chest, but does not complain of pain.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** Are you alright? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrison:** I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve never felt that panicked. I was so scared. I heard the kids -- the ones by the dinosaur exhibit. They were screaming. They didn&#39;t know what to do. I could see them thrashing around, just absolutely fucking panicked. Everyone was. A couple people swam up towards the skylight, trying to break it. They hit it one, two, maybe three times -- then they just floated back down. They weren&#39;t moving after that. More and more people stopped moving. Everyone was just floating. They were all floating. Jesus Christ -- 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Morrison begins slightly tearing up.]// 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** It&#39;s okay. You&#39;re safe. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrison:** God. I don&#39;t know what took over me. Y&#39;know, maybe if there is a God, maybe he took me over. I don&#39;t remember how I even got out. I just remember grabbing the door and falling for a minute. And then I was on the concrete. I threw up for a good five, maybe six minutes -- more water came out of me than I&#39;ve ever seen. I could hear water rushing out of the building. When I was able to shift my weight, I looked back at it. The lights were starting to flicker. And -- 
&gt; 
&gt; //[He stops again.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** Yes? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrison:** It was a trick of the lights. I&#39;m just scared. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** What was? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrison:** Before the building went dark, and I couldn&#39;t see anything -- I thought I saw someone against one of the windows. But they weren&#39;t drowning. They looked fine. And they opened their mouth to say something before I couldn&#39;t see them anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** What did this person look like, from what you remember? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrison:** That&#39;s the thing. I thought they were one of my friends, but -- I couldn&#39;t remember who, exactly. I just knew they were someone I had met before. And I knew they needed help. But I wasn&#39;t there to help them.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Dr. Pogan is silent for a moment, jotting several notes down.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** Alright. Thank you. Anything else you&#39;d like to add before we conclude our session today? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrison:** Yeah. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** Alright. What might that be? 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Morrison begins crying again.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Morrison:** When I go to sleep -- I&#39;m still there. I&#39;m still drowning. There&#39;s still water in me. It&#39;s been weeks and I can still feel water in my lungs. I&#39;ve always been drowning.

&gt; ++ ADDENDUM II: EXPLORATORY LOG 6706-W
[[/=]]

**Overview:** Area 6706-A is a tall skyscraper formerly utilized by the Hawthorne &amp; Mitchell Corporation as a central headquarters for their business operations. Though situated in downtown Los Angeles, California, 6706-A is effectively isolated from civilians through a combination of a constant Foundation security presence (disguised as private security) and localized use of a Class-C amnestic. SCP-6706 manifested within Area 6706-A on ██/██/1999, resulting in approximately 112 civilian deaths, an additional 39 civilian injuries, and a temporary loss of normalcy within the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Following containment efforts undertaken by field operatives in conjunction with MTF 991-Gamma, the building was secured and left in its post-6706 state. 

The following exploration was conducted on ██/██/2000, three months following successful containment of the building. Exploration was conducted by four operatives assigned to MTF 991-Gamma, designated MTF-A through MTF-D in the interest of maintaining the privacy of the agents. The following is a transcript of the exploration.

&gt; //[MTF-A through MTF-D are equipped with standard diving gear, including sufficient oxygen to last three hours. Their chests are outfitted with body cameras transmitting a live feed to Control. Due to concerns surrounding direct entry to Area 6706-A, the team is deployed to a maintenance tunnel connecting an exterior building to the main structure.]// 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-A:** Control, this is team lead. We&#39;re good to go here. Cameras online.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Copy, Alpha. Standby for green light. 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-D:** Oxygen at 100%. We&#39;re solid here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Affirmative. We&#39;re plotting your route through the tunnel. You&#39;ll swim about half a klick north, then enter 6706-A through a maintenance elevator shaft.
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-B:** Copy, Control.
&gt; 
&gt; //[A minute passes while Control confirms the area is free of civilian interference.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Alpha, green to go. 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-A:** Roger. We&#39;re dropping in. //[[To team members]]// Let&#39;s get swimming. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[The team enters the tunnel and begins moving towards the elevator shaft. The majority of the journey there is uneventful. Body cameras transmit footage of the metal interior consistent with prolonged exposure to seawater, showing early signs of corrosion. There appears to be slight algae growth.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** Got some algae growing here. 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-D:** Yeah. Makes sense. How long has it been? 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** A few months? Three, right? 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-A:** Yep.
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-D:** I half expected to see some fish down here. Maybe the odd shark.
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-B:** //[Laughing]// Dumbass.
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-D:** Why? It&#39;s saltwater. Same stuff as the ocean.
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-B:** We&#39;re not anywhere near the ocean, [NAME REMOVED]. Nothing can get in here unless it goes through the sewers, and the sewers are a one way trip to the ocean. 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-A:** Alright, settle down. We&#39;re nearly there. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Cameras capture the team approaching the elevator shaft. It is fully submerged, the cables having been shattered. At the bottom of the shaft is the elevator, its interior exposed due to damage from an unknown source. Visibility quickly dissipates within and past the shaft. All team members activate flashlights mounted to their shoulders.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-A:** Rodeo, check it out. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[MTF-D swims forward, slowly descending the elevator shaft with his feet to the elevator. He faces downward, his light illuminating the top of the elevator. The team moves to the shaft&#39;s entrance, watching as MTF-D continues his descent. He lands on the elevator&#39;s roof, stopping for a moment to readjust his footing before shining the light inside of the car.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-A:** See anything?
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-D:** Looks empty. Want me to move inside real quick? 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-A:** Not alone, no. Wait one.
&gt; 
&gt;  //[MTF-A turns to MTF-C, gesturing down the elevator shaft.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-A:** Go watch his ass. Junior over here and I will swim up and set up a staging point for the main structure. 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** Aye, boss.
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-B:** Shouldn&#39;t we set up lines? 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-A:** Won&#39;t be necessary. We&#39;ll keep our backs to the shaft. We&#39;ll know where to go if we need to bug out. 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-B:** Are you sure about that? //[MTF-B points to the top of the shaft.]// I don&#39;t see any light up there, man.
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-A:** Yes. I&#39;m sure. Nothing has happened in here for months. We&#39;re fine.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Alpha. Control.
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-A:** Go ahead.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** We&#39;re picking up a few unidentified masses in the main structure. Do you have a visual? 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-A:** Negative. What do you think? Bodies? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Unsure. Proceed with caution.
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** //Great//. You love to hear it. 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-A:** Relax. //[To MTF-B]// Let&#39;s go, kid. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[MTF-A and -C ascend the elevator shaft, stopping just before the main area of the structure, a reception area used by employees. Their cameras capture the sections illuminated by their flashlights -- first, the main entrance, which appears relatively free of damage. There are several chairs and pieces of furniture on the floor, likely having been moved by the water&#39;s current during initial escape attempts. The entrance leads to a small waiting area comprised of two couches, one of which possesses a male human cadaver on its leftmost cushion. The cadaver is bloated and pale, exhibiting physiological deterioration consistent with waterlogging and prolonged exposure to seawater.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** Jesus fucking Christ, dude. 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-A:** You seeing this, Control? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Affirmative. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[MTF-A pans left, seeing several broken pieces of metal and wood with sharpened tips. Two of them are broken despite being comprised of a relatively tough metal, presumably steel. Adjacent to these objects is the main reception desk, consisting of an office chair, a curved table, and a computer. Numerous books, papers, and folders are floating freely, pages and documents slowly moving away from their point of origin. Continuing to pan, MTF-A&#39;s light lands on the corpse of a woman in a blue dress suit, assumed to be the receptionist. Cause of death appears not to be drowning, but rather a severe laceration running from the upper chest to the top of the head, roughly ten to fifteen centimeters in width. This laceration has separated the head into two barely connected pieces, with portions of the brain and upper jaw exposed. A small cloud of blood is visible immediately in front of the woman&#39;s corpse.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-A:** Holy -- oh my God --
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** //[Unintelligible]// -- sick, man. What the fuck. What the fuck. Holy shit. 
&gt; 
&gt;  **MTF-D:** What the hell is going on up there? 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-A:** Control, we -- we uh. Shit -- 
&gt; 
&gt; //[MTF-A attempts to compose himself.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Say again?
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-A:** Control, we have a body here that does not make sense. Huge gash, running up to her head. Looks like something cleaved her. I can&#39;t make any sense of it. You seeing this? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Yeah, we see it. Not sure. Can you get closer to it? 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** Fuck that. Fuck that. 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-A:** Why? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Well, we&#39;d like to know what caused that. Something different happened to her. We need to know what. 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-A:** Alright. Alright, yeah. Roger that.
&gt; 
&gt; //[MTF-A grabs the shoulder of MTF-C.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-A:** Relax. You stay here and watch me. I&#39;ll go check it out. Okay? 
&gt; 
&gt; //[MTF-C does not respond, beginning to hyperventilate.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-A:** Get a fucking grip! 
&gt; 
&gt; //[MTF-A shakes MTF-C. He continues to breathe heavily, but faces MTF-A.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-A:** What did I just say? 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** You--you wanted me, uh. You wanted me to stay here. Watch you. Watch your back.
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-A:** Right. So stay here and do that. I will be back in 60 seconds, tops. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[MTF-C nods. MTF-B and -D regroup immediately outside the top of the elevator, beginning their ascent to MTF-C&#39;s position. MTF-A begins to swim towards the aforementioned female cadaver.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-D:** Elevator&#39;s empty. We&#39;re coming up to you, how copy? 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-A:** Roger. Link up with the kid. He&#39;s freaking out a little. I&#39;m gonna check the body.
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-B:** Copy.
&gt; 
&gt; //[MTF-B and -D continue their ascent. They are roughly 30 meters from MTF-C.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-B:** Hey, kid, are you at the top of this thing? 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** Yeah. Yeah. Why? 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-B:** Can&#39;t see you. Shine your light for us.
&gt; 
&gt; //[MTF-C complies, shining his light down the elevator shaft.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-B:** Kid, seriously, shine your light. 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** I am. I&#39;m aiming it down the shaft.
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-D:** We don&#39;t see shit. Quit fucking around.
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** I&#39;m serious. Control, do you see my feed? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Roger. He&#39;s telling the truth.
&gt; 
&gt; //[MTF-B and -D stop, looking around and surveying their surroundings. They shine their lights back down the elevator shaft in the direction they originated from. They are no longer able to see the elevator despite the fact that it should be within range of their flashlights.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** Guys? 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-D:** I think we got lost. Hang -- 
&gt; 
&gt; //[There is an abrupt thud, followed by what sounds like a pressurized hiss. MTF-B and MTF-D&#39;s feeds go black. Control loses visual of their cameras. MTF-C&#39;s feed captures audio consistent with muffled screaming.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** Fuck. Guys? 
&gt; 
&gt; //[MTF-C swims down slightly, attempting to gain more visibility with his light. The light extends for several meters before seemingly fading out altogether. There is no sign of MTF-B, MTF-D, or the elevator.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[MTF-C begins to hyperventilate again. His camera shows him swinging around wildly in an apparent panic. He then swims up slightly, returning to the entry point to the reception area. At this point, Control notices that MTF-A&#39;s feed has been stuck on a close-up of the female cadaver seen earlier for several minutes.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Charlie, come in. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[MTF-C does not respond, continuing to hyperventilate.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Charlie, this is Control. Respond.
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** You need to get me out of here. You need to get me out of here. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Charlie, you need to relax. We cannot establish contact with the rest of your team. You need to calm down.
&gt; 
&gt; //[MTF-C continues to hyperventilate.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Charlie, we need to assess the situation and you are the only person who can do that right now. If you do not relax, you will burn through your oxygen quickly. We cannot send anyone else in there. We can get you out but only if you calm down and listen. Do you understand?
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** Fuck. Fuck. Yeah. Okay. Okay, yeah. //[MTF-C&#39;s breathing slows.]// What do you -- what do you want me to do? Please just get me out of here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Just listen. MTF-A is not responding. His feed is coming through, but he&#39;s not moving. You need to find him and make sure he&#39;s okay. Then you can go find MTF-B and MTF-D. We cannot send you looking for anyone but MTF-A alone right now. Do you understand? 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** Yes. Yeah, I understand. Where is his feed coming from? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Near the body you saw earlier. It&#39;s a short swim forward. Just stay calm, find him, and then we can work on getting you out of the building. Okay? 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** Okay. Okay. I&#39;m good. I&#39;m gonna move to his position. Can you talk me through this? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Yeah, of course. Just breathe slowly and calmly. Deep breaths. Nothing too abrupt or fast. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[MTF-C begins swimming towards MTF-A&#39;s last known position. His breathing slows to an acceptable level.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** You&#39;re doing great. Keep going. A minute or two and you&#39;ll be there. 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** Alright. I&#39;m okay. I&#39;m calm.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** I know. You&#39;re doing great. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[MTF-C&#39;s camera records his swim, visibly noticeably lower in the reception area than before. He periodically moves his light around, illuminating walls and scattered debris. Control hears audio consistent with a human male drowning.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Do you hear anything, Charlie? 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** No. Negative. Just the water.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Are you certain? 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** Yeah. Why? Do you hear something? 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Control elects not to inform MTF-C of the audio, believing it will distress him and result in mission failure.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Negative. Just making sure. You should be at Alpha&#39;s position in a second or two.
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** Copy.
&gt; 
&gt; //[MTF-C swims past a cloud of particulate debris, his light falling on a humanoid figure in black. He moves his light up the figure, revealing it to be MTF-A. The oxygen tank is detached, air hissing and leaking into the water. The female cadaver is missing. MTF-C does not react to this, immediately moving to aid MTF-A.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** Fuck! Control, Alpha&#39;s tank is detached! There&#39;s water in his mask! Fuck! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Is he alive? 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** I don&#39;t know! //[MTF-C attempts to reattach the oxygen tank.]// God damnit. God damnit. Fuck. Stay with me -- 
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Charlie, back off. His mask is compromised. There&#39;s nothing we can do. 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** I got him! I got him! Hang on! 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Control hears audio consistent with whispering and low groaning.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Charlie, you need to get out of there now. Something is happening -- 
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** Wake up! Wake up! Please! 
&gt; 
&gt; //[The groaning intensifies, now roughly as loud as MTF-C&#39;s vocalizations.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Charlie! Get out of there! Now! Get back to the elevator -- 
&gt; 
&gt; //[MTF-C&#39;s feed shows his arm being grabbed by a gloved hand. He pans right, revealing it to be the hand of MTF-A. Despite having clearly asphyxiated, MTF-A is animate and violently thrashes MTF-C for several seconds. Control hears MTF-A screaming clearly despite his mask being entirely flooded.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** //[Screaming]]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Charlie, move now!
&gt; 
&gt; //[MTF-C kicks MTF-A off, causing MTF-A to convulse and writhe violently in the water. MTF-C turns around to face towards the entrance. The room is now occupied by dozens if not hundreds of bodies, all of which are either motionless or convulsing. At the front of this group are MTF-B and MTF-D. The water in the room begins to assume a slightly red coloration. Several of the figures are seen opening their mouths to speak.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[Before Control can react to the situation, MTF-C looks down. The remainder of the feed is blurry, but an object assumed to be a hand is seen grabbing his head and pulling down as he screams, beginning to drown as the mask is pulled from his face. The feed cuts to black a moment later. Contact with all team members is lost and the mission is declared a failure.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[Six days following this operation, MTF-C was found in the dry portion of the maintenance tunnel, his scuba gear missing. He was conscious but in a state of shock at the time a recovery team arrived. MTF-C was subsequently treated for severe hypothermia and, after his recovery was deemed probable, transferred to an undisclosed intelligence facility operated by the Foundation.]//

&gt; ++ ADDENDUM II: INTERVIEW FILE 6706-Q
[[/=]]

Interview conducted by Dr. Pogan. Interviewee is ██████ ███████, designated MTF-C. 

&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** Allow me to begin by expressing my condolences regarding the loss of your squadmates.
&gt; 
&gt; //[MTF-C does not respond.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** We, uh -- we&#39;ve watched the footage from your chest camera about two or three times these past few days. There&#39;s something, truth be told, that I don&#39;t quite understand. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Dr. Pogan retrieves a photograph. It depicts a frame from MTF-C&#39;s camera feed during the operation.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** This is a frame from your feed. It&#39;s roughly 30 minutes into the operation, right before you find MTF-A. I&#39;ve studied this frame for...well, pretty much the entire week trying to come to terms with it.
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** The fuck are you on about? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** Take a look at it.
&gt; 
&gt; //[MTF-C looks at the photograph, then raises his eyes to meet Dr. Pogan&#39;s.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** I don&#39;t see anything. Looks like water.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** Yeah. See, I thought that too. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Dr. Pogan points to the right hand corner of the photo.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** See that? There&#39;s a little discoloration in the top right. Just enough to raise some suspicion. So, being who I am, I&#39;m not able to let it go. It bugs me. I have the people in photo processing take a look at it, and they agree that it&#39;s weird, to say the least. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Dr. Pogan retrieves a second photo.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** This is an enhanced copy of that picture. The object in the top right is enhanced and depixelated. Take a look. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[MTF-C looks at the photograph. He stares at it for much longer than before.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** What does that look like to you? 
&gt; 
&gt; //[MTF-C does not respond.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** Agent. What does that look like to you?
&gt; 
&gt; **MTF-C:** This isn&#39;t real. You did this. This isn&#39;t possible. I know what I saw.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Pogan:** And Control knows what it saw. I&#39;ll be honest with you, agent. I don&#39;t understand how that&#39;s possible either. But that&#39;s him. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[The image is a still photograph of MTF-A in the right-hand corner of the frame, staring directly at the camera. His mouth is agape and his eyes are fully open, the eyelids barely visible.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[MTF-A&#39;s expression in this photograph has been variably described as that of an attempt at speaking or a smile. Photo analysis teams noted that damage to his uniform and equipment suggests exposure to saltwater in excess of several months.]//
