&gt; Dear Olivia,
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#39;t know why I ever started talking to you again. Our relationship was a failure. You were abusive, and I would put up with it. You always said you would change, I just needed to give you another chance, and I would, but you&#39;d keep on reverting back to your old behavior. Ignoring me when you don&#39;t need me. Messaging me when you do.
&gt; 
&gt; That&#39;s why I left you. Can you blame me? 
&gt; 
&gt; But now, five years later, here I am. Exchanging letters with you again, just like we did back in high school. You have changed, I think. You&#39;re just... so indescribably kind.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;ll never forget that night I met you-- the //real// you. 
&gt; 
&gt; There were fish falling from the sky. A romantic setting, I know. A giant catfish was about to hit my head when you pushed me away, concerned. And then you realized it was me, and I could see the guilt in your eyes.
&gt; 
&gt; That&#39;s a good sign, you know? Resentment for your actions. It was from that point that I realized you reinvented yourself. 
&gt; 
&gt; Then another catfish fell and hit you right in the head, and we laughed together.
&gt; 
&gt; You hugged me that day, and I didn&#39;t realize how touch-starved I really had been.
&gt; 
&gt; Your warmth and your love just... enveloped me. I feel captivated-- but in a good way. 
&gt; 
&gt; I love you now.
&gt; 
&gt; So when you read this letter years from now, when I&#39;m dead, I want you to remember that. I love you, and you&#39;ve done great things. 
&gt; 
&gt; The world has a place for you, it already brought us together with those two catfish. Maybe it was fate. Maybe the world just needed another sweet love story.
&gt; 
&gt; God, I could just go on and on...
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;ll say it again.
&gt; 
&gt; I love you. Don&#39;t forget that. And maybe if you don&#39;t forget me, I won&#39;t have to leave.
&gt; 
&gt; - Yours sincerely, Taylor.
