Central Normalcy Authority Iteration [[span class=&#34;tl_id&#34;]]940662b90e78660244bce96e7776dc7f[[/span]], &#34;Our Foundation&#34; of [wikipedia:Canonical_bundle Canonical Bundle] DW17 Timeline Delta-Blue, has been formally audited regarding compliance with organizational objectives outlined in Articles 0.2 and 1.7 of the //[/*scp-5618 1981 Multi-Foundation Coalition Agreement]//. Advance notice regarding this audit was not established, as this Iteration&#39;s Oracle position has been left vacant for several decades, with no suitable replacement representative made known to the Collective.

The following report consists of recovered files regarding the Iteration in question, presented to both document this audit and evoke its verdict. The audit was manually conducted under direct supervision of Oracle-Prime, and its verdict may not be refuted.

Undated document from the desk of Dr. Dougall Deering.

[[div class=&#34;notation&#34;]]
What is waste?

The dictionary defines... well, nothing actually. //We// define. The dictionary only records our definitions. Even that term is misleading, &#34;the dictionary,&#34; as though there were only one. Merriam-Webster probably says that waste (noun) is nothing but a useless byproduct of something better. Accurate so far as it goes, but it doesn&#39;t go nearly far enough. That&#39;s our fault. The worst kind of waste they&#39;re aware of is spent nuclear fuel, or carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Their definition was written without having borne witness to the irreducible Nascimbenium cores powering innumerable impossible mad science projects, or the infernal combustion engines punching holes in the noözone layer with their demonosulfuric emissions. That&#39;s the kind of waste __our__ dictionary takes into account. Metal that absorbs psychic signals and grows like cancer. Balls of backward-flowing time. Orichalcum, adamant and ectoplasm. The Colostomy from Out of Space. An endless catalogue of Anomalous fallout and excreta which only we can ameliorate, because only we can see it, because we set the world up that way.

But we&#39;re getting tired of seeing it. After all this time, this endless uphill landfill-slog, we need to see clear blue sky beyond our horizon of trash.

If only putting the waste out of mind could also put it out of sight. One might be forgiven for wishing that the very concept could be erased from our manifest of magic, as the gutters overflow with Anomalous ooze and the grey goo projections turn perilously proximal. One might be forgiven for wishing that the dictionary truly did define, and that by changing the definition of waste, we could change the very thing itself.

But forgiveness is never guaranteed. That&#39;s what gives it meaning.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

= //&lt;Dr. Dougall Deering, Chief of Acroamatic Abatement at Site-43, is sitting across from Dr. Ngo at her desk. His hands are bandaged. He is very still, as he is recovering from heavy sedation. There is a small red plastic box on the desk beside Dr. Ngo&#39;s recording device, decorated with the heraldry of a confectionery company. He is staring at it.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] We&#39;ll ease you into this.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Okay.

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] What were you doing in Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-D on September the 8th, 2028?

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Supervising a flush.

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] And what does that entail?

= //&lt;Dr. Deering&#39;s voice is flat and without affect, as though he is reciting from memory.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] AAF-D is the powerhouse of 43&#39;s abatement plant. It&#39;s the single largest Anomalous waste facility ever constructed. Since the effluence crisis escalated globally, it&#39;s been doing non-stop quadruple-duty. Every few years we have to shut it down, for a period not exceeding one hour -- anything longer and the whole system backs up irrecoverably -- and pump the overflow into the anachronic sump below the Site.

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] Why?

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Because output is severely lagging behind input. We&#39;re overwhelmed, and we&#39;re operating on triage principles. Any substance requiring too much time or too heavy a resource commitment to abate has to be set aside as impractical, because certain other abatements are too time-sensitive to delay. Some of the Anomalous effects of the waste we process can worsen the longer they&#39;re kept in the pipeline, and that&#39;s not even getting into what it does to the pipes themselves. When we perform the flush, they&#39;re often already white-hot, or ice cold, or humming obscenities in Latin. It&#39;s always a close call, because we can&#39;t afford to do it more regularly. Not on our schedule.

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] So this flush resets the equipment to factory?

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Not hardly. It just buys us a little more time. The next flush...

= //&lt;Dr. Deering sighs. His tone is becoming strident.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Probably not even a year.

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] But you can still pump what you can&#39;t abate into the sump, right.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] For now. Not for much longer. It&#39;s getting full.

= //&lt;Silence on recording.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] You can cut to the chase now. I don&#39;t... I don&#39;t feel anything anyway.

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] You&#39;re on a lot of painkillers. That&#39;s normal.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Sure.

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] Who was in charge of the flush this year?

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Deputy Chief of Janitorial and Maintenance Ph-- Philip Eugene Deering.

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] Your brother.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] My... yes.

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] And you were supervising him?

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Yes. No. I was... visiting him.

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] Visiting him? You work at the same facility.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Yes. We&#39;ve been here together for decades, but we haven&#39;t been here //together// at all. I never speak to him. I don&#39;t want to get into that, we just... we aren&#39;t close.

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] What did the two of you talk about?

= //&lt;Dr. Deering nods at the box on the table.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] That. I found it in an old box in our parents&#39; house, cleaning out the basement. I thought he&#39;d like to have it. I bought it for him from the general store when we were children.

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] May I?

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Go on.

= //&lt;Dr. Ngo picks up the toy. It consists of a single sliding compartment. She slides it out, then back in, then back out again. She shrugs.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] What does it do?

= //&lt;Dr. Deering smiles faintly.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] It makes things disappear.

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] What?

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Put something in it. Your pin, maybe.

= //&lt;Dr. Ngo unclips her Site-43 badge pin and places it inside the compartment. She closes it. She opens it again. The pin is missing. She closes and opens the compartment several more times. The pin is still missing.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] How does it work?

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] It&#39;s magic. I&#39;m an occultist, you know.

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] Did you end up giving it to him?

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] No.

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] What happened instead? Take your time.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] I&#39;m not as familiar with the layout of F-D as I used to be. They&#39;ve had to make a lot of changes to keep up with the pressure. There was a valve...

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] On the junction between the...

= //&lt;Dr. Ngo checks her notes.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] ...orphic and ambichronological outflow pipes. What does that mean?

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Two very different types of esoteric effluence in side-by-side conduits. There&#39;s a junction connecting them with a series of impregnable stoppers operated by remote control, for combining their contents under specific emergency circumstances. Intermixing in rigorously-controlled amounts to neutralize both in the case of an overflow. The valve is only there to allow manual access during accidents, since it&#39;s impossible to do this with the appropriate level of care by hand. It shouldn&#39;t have moved just because I bumped into it.

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] So why did it? Metal fatigue?

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Maybe. Every individual facility is suffering from budget crunch, and the equipment is aging rapidly. But no... no, I think we were actually in the early stages of a total collapse already, and this was just the first sign. Those pipes were full to bursting, when they should have been almost empty...

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] Are you suggesting they hadn&#39;t been flushed properly?

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] No. I don&#39;t... I can&#39;t see how. Look, they&#39;re under a lot of pressure, the people who work in AcroAbate. And the materials are unpredictable. There could have been some sort of duplicative reaction. The point is, there was a lot more effluence in the system than expected, and a lot of it&#39;s still in there now. It might have come blasting out anyway, even if I hadn&#39;t hit the valve. 

= //&lt;Dr. Deering sighs.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] But I did, so it happened the way it did. But it didn&#39;t make a difference, it definitely didn&#39;t really make a difference.

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] What happened next?

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] The materials mixed inappropriately, and the orphic outflow instantly became every version of itself it had ever been: before, during, and after abatement, simultaneously. It looked like an army of technicolour ghosts all melted together, bursting out of the pipes like steam.

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] And then?

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] And then Phil... Deputy Chief Deering, headed for the suction pump controls near the break. Every room and corridor in the entire facility has these controls; all he had to do was turn a single handle and all the emergent phenomena would get sucked into the sinkhole without further incident.

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] But that&#39;s not what happened.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] No. Instead, he was met halfway by some... //thing,// which manifested behind him, between us, away from the ghostflow. Something writhing, ethereal. It sucked up most of the airborne effluence, then crunched itself down to his size... I could //hear// the crunching, and then--

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] You don&#39;t have to r--

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] //&lt;shouting&gt;// And then it moved right through him, overlaid itself on him, coiled around him and started to shrink. And his eyes rolled back, his skin shrivelled in against his bones and split where his organs were, and they burst out of him, and he melted into a pile of... all over the floor... and it was gone, and he was...

= //&lt;Dr. Deering heaves ineffectually, hyperventilating for several seconds before recovering.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] I don&#39;t think he felt it.

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] And then you turned the handle yourself.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] I don&#39;t remember.

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] It was captured on camera.

= //&lt;Dr. Ngo gestures at Dr. Deering&#39;s hands.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] It&#39;s how that happened. The controls were compromised. The ghosts were out too long.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] I don&#39;t remember.

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] You&#39;ve been traumatized, of course--

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] If you got it all on camera, why drag me through this again?

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] I needed to hear your version for the report.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] My...? My //version//? What the fuck does that mean?

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] It&#39;s just standard procedure, doctor.

= //&lt;Silence on recording.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;ngo&#34;]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] How do I get my pin back?

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Shake it to the left. Hard.

= //&lt;Dr. Ngo shakes the box, then opens the compartment. She retrieves her button, and reaffixes it to her jacket.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] It was never gone. A slide to the right, and a little mirror to hide the evidence. No magic at all.

= //&lt;Dr. Deering shakes his head.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Just a trick.

**AFTERWORD:** This interview reaffirmed Dr. Deering&#39;s testimony in the immediate aftermath of the accident, in which he reported the presence of a rogue entity unrelated to the overflowing materials and responsible for his brother&#39;s death. No personnel reviewing the security camera footage of the incident are able to perceive said entity, even under mnestic treatment.

On the recommendation of Dr. Ngo and Chief Torosyan-Deering of Janitorial and Maintenance, Dr. Deering has been prescribed one year&#39;s mandatory mental health leave.

[[span class=&#34;st&#34;]]SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:[[/span]] SCP-7243 must, and must only, abate acroamatic waste materials which do not exist;[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Absentia-Class Anomalies are employed by the Foundation in ensuring the absence of non-existent phenomena.[[/span]] it cannot, under any circumstances, be used to neutralize anything measurably extant. This procedure is a factual result of SCP-7243&#39;s operation, and requires no active maintenance. 

Minimization of existing esoteric effluence is achieved, globally, by strict adherence to the following procedures:

* All contained Anomalies must undergo regular inspection to monitor trends in production of Anomalous waste byproducts;
* All such trends must be reviewed by Acroamatic Abatement personnel to determine existential abatement qualification;
* Candidates generating effluence with sufficient frequency, quantity, and/or toxicity are designated SCP-7243-A;
* Each affected containment facility must coordinate the installation of secure waste collection and storage mechanisms, as needed;
* Each SCP-7243-A&#39;s respective waste collection system must remain active if, and only if, it spontaneously ceases generating waste;
* If any SCP-7243-A spontaneously resumes generating waste, its collection system must be deactivated, and Logistics immediately notified;
* The Logistics Branch must maintain a global network of consolidation and supply lines for transport of non-existent[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]For clarity: all components of this network must be designed to securely handle full payloads of volatile acroamatic material, despite the fact that these payloads will be absent, and the entire network will handle precisely nothing.[[/span]] effluence to Site-43;

Waste is when a thing full of life and promise, a thing of beauty, is obliterated before its full potential is realized. Waste is snuffing out a light in our darkest hour.

In principle, the Foundation only considers neutralization of Anomalous phenomena where containment is infeasible and un-containment is undesirable; generally, if one Anomaly produces another, that new phenomenon should also be contained and studied. When these by-products are generated //continuously//, however, their containment will //eventually// become infeasible, and so the criteria is met for their disposal.

Mass containment facilities (particularly those specializing in biological containment) are already equipped with immense infrastructures for disposing of conventional waste. Unfortunately, these systems cannot contend with //unconventional// waste, the esoteric properties of which may eventuate any number of unforeseen issues. Each year, innumerable breaches are caused by the reaction of multiple Anomalous substances in spaces they should never have occupied in the first instance -- garbage dumpsters, sewage tanks, ventilation systems and the like. This leaves our most crucial Sites with the issue of storing, transporting, and neutralizing large concentrations of volatile esoteric effluence, on a case-by-case basis, for an arbitrary number of Anomalies, with arbitrary properties, //ad infinitum.//

This is the ever-progressing front on which Acroamatic Abatement does battle. It attempts to generalize the problems of safe storage, transport, and amelioration for arbitrary acroamatic waste. These are extremely messy problems to solve, and not just in the practical sense:

//Theoretically//, Acroamatic Abatement deals in the development of containment and neutralization techniques for //all possible// Anomalous effects, and accounting for their potential interactions with //all other// Anomalous effects. At time of writing, no singular inciting element has been identified as the cause to which the entire known range of Anomalous phenomena can be attributed; in the opinion of this acroamaticist, no such element exists. Definitionally, Anomalies subvert generally-accepted models of how reality works, and so their classification is determined by whether they are congruent with our limited human understanding -- there is no &#34;Swann boson&#34; (Pickman //et. al,// 2021) or similar phenomenon that grants a substance the quality of //defying expectation.//

It is, therefore, impossible to develop a comprehensive technique which can strip any arbitrary substance of its Anomalous properties with certainty, short of developing rigorous scientific explanations for those properties and conveying them pedagogically to the human populace entire. As such, the primary approach of Acroamatic Abatement has been to group esoteric substances into broad classes based on their properties, developing containment and treatment strategies for each class and subclass therein. This classification system is necessarily non-rigorous, and cannot comprehensively describe all acroamatic material (for reasons aforementioned), but a more effective model has yet to be developed.

I couldn&#39;t save him. If I&#39;d had even one second to react, I would have. I&#39;m sorry the system let him down, let __you__ down. I&#39;m sorry we let it decline so far and so fast. At this point we can&#39;t even begin to predict how these increasingly volatile materials will interact with each other and our obsolete equipment. The entity which killed Philip could have resulted from any number of vectors; it will never be possible to blame any one in specific. All we can do is rededicate ourselves to the cause he gave his life for, do it better, do it more efficiently, do it right.

Amelia, nobody on Earth understands what you lost the way I do, and so I understand if you need someone to blame. I&#39;m in charge of AcroAbate, and whatever happens under that umbrella is on me. That&#39;s the job. But we can&#39;t lose sight of the fact that what killed Philip was an extreme statistical outlier under nobody&#39;s control, a nasty twist of fate that we can&#39;t even comprehend, let alone measure or mete out justice to. After all of our efforts, things like that still exist. They&#39;re even multiplying. If we dwell on our mistakes, they&#39;ll overtake us. We can&#39;t give up on our quest to figure out where all of this is coming from, and how to send it back there. If we do, it wins. If it wins, Philip died for nothing.

You can&#39;t even call him your brother. Not even in a __letter__. Take responsibility for once in your life, you smug sack of shit! 

There never was any __entity__. You&#39;re the only one who claims to have seen it, and whatever you might believe, you&#39;re not that fucking important. You know what Phil told me when I asked if you were coming to his Deputy Chief promo? &#34;Probably not. He&#39;d be too ashamed.&#34; And you know what else? He&#39;d internalized that for so long, he didn&#39;t even think to be sad about it. It was just the way things were, to him. I think that&#39;s when I realized I was going to have to hate you, well before you finally did something to really, truly earn it. 

You&#39;re incapable of facing up to anything you think reflects poorly on you, so you make up excuses for why you shouldn&#39;t have to. Can&#39;t attend the ceremony because of a scheduling conflict, not because you can&#39;t stand admitting you share DNA with a glorified janitor. Can&#39;t come to the wedding because it&#39;s even worse seeing more janitor blood seeping into the family. Can&#39;t take a break from dissolving parathylene like the single-minded industrious little worm that you are to allow even a single genuine moment of base human connection. Can&#39;t admit you bumblefucked into a piece of sensitive equipment because you were too preoccupied with the cleverness of your weak, self-centred peace offering, and killed the only person on the planet who ever had even the tiniest scrap of respect for you.

Let me tell you something, Dougall Deering. Philip never reflected poorly on you. __You reflect poorly on him__, perpetual present tense, and to his infinite credit that never crossed his mind.

[[span class=&#34;st&#34;]]DESCRIPTION:[[/span]] SCP-7243 is the //Deering-Placeholder Latent Existential Abatement// (DePLExA) //Engine//, an advanced industrial eigenmachine designed for comprehensive mass disposal of generalized esoteric waste. It is housed within Acroamatic Abatement Facility //Exactus// (AAF-X), the nethermost structure of subterranean Research and Containment Site-43. AAF-X is the largest waste processing facility on Earth, and is responsible for a ~95% decrease in global acroamatic waste production.

From the baseline perspective, SCP-7243 processes no waste. Rather than actively detoxifying esoteric effluence, DePLExA performs a novel acroamatic abatement procedure which ensures the non-existence of any effluence which it would be used to abate. Were any substance to be deposited into SCP-7243, the following would occur:

* that substance would instantly be annihilated, retrocausally, from all of spacetime;
* the substance then would never have existed at all, and thus could not have been deposited into SCP-7243 in the first place;
* this scenario would generate a buildup of retrocausal quanta[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]A general term encompassing anti-chronons, malignant narremes, and related phenomena.[[/span]] which, if left unchecked, would induce a ZK-Class temporal paradox;
* SCP-7243 would absorb the imminent paradox and redirect its quanta into the immediate past, colliding with the paradoxical substance, causing its annihilation;
* thus a stable time loop would form, wherein the substance&#39;s non-existence is self-justifying. 

As such (from the baseline perspective), SCP-7243 prevents the creation of any esoteric effluence which it would practically be used to neutralize. So long as the supply lines necessary to deliver acroamatic materials from their sources to SCP-7243 remain fully operational, no such materials will ever be produced. 

SCP-7243-A collectively designates all Anomalies for which supply lines to SCP-7243 have been instated. To date, 97% of all effluence-generating[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Technically no longer effluence-generating, with occasional exceptions.[[/span]] Anomalies comprise SCP-7243-A.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Right?

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]]  No, I mean, this is //insane.// You are insane. This will never work. Best case scenario, Temporal Anomalies has to assassinate you last week.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] It&#39;s just math, Amelia. You can do the math, I know you can. One minus one doesn&#39;t equal the end of the world, it equals //zero.//

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]]  That&#39;s not the math you&#39;re proposing. This is, what... one plus //minus// one equals minus one plus one?

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] See? You get it.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]]  Fuck off. But how can you build something capable of doing this?

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] That&#39;s why I brought Place on board. He&#39;s assured me we can effectuate the relevant chronomechanics exactly as written.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]]  Without completely screwing the timestream? You see why that&#39;s a top-level concern, right?

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] The time//plane// is our top-level concern, technically. But yes, of course I understand the gravity of this proposal. We&#39;ve consulted with Reynders. It&#39;s viable. The failsafes are foolproof.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] Proven by certified fools. This is a mistake. This is all going to come crashing down.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Not if it&#39;s built properly. With redundancies. Structural support. Rigorous stress testing. The absolute best engineering we have available.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]]  You&#39;re sucking up to me. You&#39;re actually... unbelievable.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] This is the answer, Amelia. This is how we kill waste.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]]  More like--

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Or maybe it kills us, all of us, because you were too busy being angry at one man to put in the work of protecting the entire human race.

= //&lt;Silence on recording.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Because we&#39;re doing this. We //need// to do this. You can squander your talents building cisterns and pipelines for acres of gunk we&#39;ll never be able to wade through, while I put together this perfect solution imperfectly, if that&#39;s what you think is best.

[[div class=&#34;modal&#34;]]
[[span class=&#34;st&#34;]]OPERATIONAL MECHANICS:[[/span]] SCP-7243 only abates materials which do not exist. Conversely, any material which //does// measurably exist cannot be processed by SCP-7243. This is no flaw of the Engine&#39;s design -- by virtue of existing, any observable substance is predestined to never be processed by SCP-7243, and must be abated by conventional means. Attempts to deposit existent materials into SCP-7243 are invariably futile, as some sequence of events will inevitably transpire such that those materials never reach SCP-7243&#39;s central aperture. 

Such events statistically manifest as logistical failures. For instance: an anti-esoteric shipping crate containing a quantity of undetected effluence is loaded onto a cargo ship //en route// to Site-43. If stored above-deck, the crate might fall overboard; if below, the ship might sink or encounter critical issues mid-voyage. As the crate grows nearer to AAF-X, the exact circumstances preventing its eradication become increasingly chaotic and disastrous. 

----

[[span class=&#34;st&#34;]]CONTINGENCIES:[[/span]] Fortunately, the hypothetical instance described above is impossible. If a container (or transport vessel) possesses any amount of effluence, it must fail to reach AAF-X, and so its entire payload will exist.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Or the effluence is destined to be detected beforehand and preemptively removed before shipping; or it will go undetected but spill out of its container in transit; //et cetera.//[[/span]]  Full waste containers can be reliably detected and rerouted.

By continuously monitoring the production (and lack thereof) of all esoteric waste, globally, Acroamatic Abatement personnel cross-reference spontaneous abatement failures with Logistics&#39; effluence collection and transportation network, thereby predicting precisely where further logistical failures are most likely to occur. These failures can then be preemptively avoided -- the relevant effluence must still be redirected to backup facilities, but their corresponding supply lines can be temporarily halted and inspected for faults. In this way, SCP-7243&#39;s behavior &#39;warns&#39; the Foundation of any impending event which would (and must) prevent the transportation of extant effluence to AAF-X.

SCP-7243 is also highly sensitive to local chronological shift, and -- should such a shift occur -- it is configured to reference the causal dependencies of its surroundings in order to reinforce its own chronology. The Parachronology Division has identified seven personnel (D. Deering, P. Deering, Place H. MD., A. McInnis, N. Ngo, I. Reynders, A. Torosyan-Deering) on whose actions SCP-7243 is causally dependent; in case of impending XK-Class Event, due either to external influence or some internal malfunction, it is crucial that these individuals (or their remains, where applicable) remain proximal to AAF-X. For this purpose, the aforementioned (surviving) individuals have been organized into Applied Task Force Digamma-7243, indefinitely stationed within Site-43, and provided amenities to minimize departures.

As performing referential calculations imposes a significant electrical drain on the Site-43 local power grid, the device will only perform this check automatically once every three days. Shift detection may be instigated manually at any time by the Chief of Applied Occultism.

----

[[span class=&#34;st&#34;]]ORIGIN:[[/span]] In Q4 2029, following an extended leave of absence, Applied Occultism Chief Dougall A. Deering returned to duty with newfound interest in novel acroamatic abatement techniques. Dr. Deering submitted several project proposals advocating for the creation of experimental abatement mechanisms based upon various parascientific theories; all such proposals were denied for either (or both) excessive cost or lack of methodological confidence.

In Q1 2031, a denied proposal was selected for reconsideration by Esoteric Polymath[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]An administrative and research position of parascientific advisory to Overseer Council, permitting Dr. PHMD. to authorize and oversee various projects as needed.[[/span]] Place. H. MD., PhD., who noted that the Pilcrow-Minkowski Center for Multidisciplinary Studies had verified Dr. Deering&#39;s relevant findings at scale. Jointly backed by the P. M. Center and the Parachronology Division, the project was retroactively approved. Construction began Q2 2031 under the engineering supervision of Janitorial and Maintenance Section Chief Amelia Torosyan-Deering, and was completed Q2 2032.

What is waste?

Sometimes it&#39;s a good thing. Heat shedding, for example. We work off our excess physical energy into sweat, its mental equivalent into a job well done. We radiate the remainder over time, or convect it into the winds of change, or else conduct it into the cold spaces between warm bodies. Stabilizing the interval, preventing burnout.

Waste can be transformative.

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]04/17 █7:██ |[[/span]] Site-79 reports full production of [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]effluence[[/span]] by all (respective) [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]SCP-7243-A[[/span]] instances, indicating a comprehensive failure of its dedicated supply line within ~80 hours. Logistics halts relevant operations for immediate inspection.

----

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]04/18 0█:0█ |[[/span]] Containment Site-50 (Tokyo, Japan) reports full production of [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]effluence[[/span]] by all (respective) [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]SCP-7243-A[[/span]] instances, indicating a collective failure of Japan&#39;s dedicated supply lines. Additional Logistics personnel are deployed for inspection.

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]04/18 09:██ -- ██:47 |[[/span]] Logistics is unable to discern cause of eventual supply failure. Local fallback [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]abatement[[/span]] facilities have exceeded capacity; supply lines are resumed to redirect excess [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]effluence[[/span]] to Australian fallback sites. Within the following 8-hour duration, Containment Sites-36, -45, -84 report full production of [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]effluence[[/span]], indicating a complete failure of all dedicated supply lines across Asia, Australia, and Eastern Europe.

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]04/19 █0:█3 |[[/span]] Logistics is unable to deploy sufficient personnel for situational assessment. [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]Acroamatic Abatement[[/span]] personnel are notified of an impending event of unclear nature, and begin rigorous inspection of [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]AAF-X[[/span]] and relevant delivery systems (while still operational).

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]04/19 17:█0 |[[/span]] Various Foundation facilities across Western Europe begin to report similar failures of existential [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]abatement[[/span]]. [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]Acroamatic Abatement[[/span]] personnel discover that these failures have been occurring at a roughly consistent rate; the effect appears to be spreading outward, radially, from Site-79.

----

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]04/20 ██:38 |[[/span]] Total existential [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]abatement[[/span]] failure reported across all Sites outside North America. Overwatch Command and Parachronology are informed of an impending global [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]abatement[[/span]] failure of unknown origin. Emergency transport contingencies are immediately activated worldwide to alleviate near-critical buildups of extant [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]effluence[[/span]]. Parachronology begins lateral chronological analysis protocol to determine likelihood of chronological or other reality-shift. ATF [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]Digamma-7243[[/span]] are immediately called to their posts within [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]AAF-X[[/span]].

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]04/20 ██:21 |[[/span]] Due to loss of .AIC-powered communication encryption services (via [/scp-6488 RAIDFRAME VIII]), Chinese militia groups intercept Logistics&#39; communications regarding the ongoing emergent scenario. Mainland China&#39;s government refuses entry to Logistics&#39; transport vessels, citing direct order of the Global Occult Coalition. Contingency systems are unable to account for critical buildup of esoteric substances, resulting in a catastrophic hazardous materials breach. Sites-50, -79 are lost.

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]04/20 █8:4█ |[[/span]] Facilities across North America&#39;s Western Coast begin to experience existential [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]abatement[[/span]] failure.

All but one of ATF [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]Digamma-7243[[/span]] have reported to [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]AAF-X[[/span]].

[[/div]]

Implications unclear.

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]04/21 █2:██ |[[/span]] With no discernable indication of the impending event&#39;s nature, it is presumed by default that some oblique malfunction of [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]SCP-7243[[/span]] will be responsible. Dr. Reynders proposes the deactivation of [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]SCP-7243[[/span]] immediately following the delivery of all remaining [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]effluence[[/span]] //in absentia//, as those non-materials must be voided into [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]its aperture[[/span]] to prevent a ZK-Class temporal paradox.

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]04/21 █4:3█ |[[/span]] O5 Council reports that extra-universal parties and contingency groups are entirely unresponsive. Emergency Protocol &#34;VEILBREAK&#34; enacted; all available resources redirected toward [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]abatement[[/span]], cleanup and contingency efforts. [*/scp-2000 SCP-2000] activated in standby mode.

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]04/21 0█:█7 |[[/span]] Dr. Reynders convenes remotely with O5 Council; she is incidentally informed of blacksite Facility-6488, in which RAIDFRAME VIII (LOTUS) is housed. She is then informed of the true nature of LOTUS&#39; origin and operation, as well as its imminent planned deactivation. Dr. Reynders attempts to warn the Council of the potential ramifications of LOTUS&#39; deactivation, but the connection is abruptly terminated by unknown means.

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]04/21 ██:14 |[[/span]] Further correspondence between Dr. Reynders and Dr. PHMD.:

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]04/21 06:██ |[[/span]] Dr. Reynders proceeds to disassemble and jury-rig nearby terminal components into a makeshift broadcast system. She attempts to hail Facility-6488 and all nearby Sites, calling for any available respondents. //[[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]But nobody came.[[/span]]//

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]04/21 0█:2█ |[[/span]] As the final wastecarte approaches [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]SCP-7243&#39;s central aperture[[/span]], all remaining ATF personnel and maintenance technicians prepare for the first ever complete deactivation of [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]AAF-X[[/span]].

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]04/21 █6:██ |[[/span]] LOTUS begins its deactivation sequence, causing an unprecedented release of highly deviant artificial intelligences into various digital systems, globally and beyond.

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]04/21 █6:█9 |[[/span]] [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]SCP-7243[[/span]] successfully commences shutdown. No faults are detected. Dr. Deering begins arguing with Dr. Reynders, maintaining the position that their deactivation of [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]SCP-7243[[/span]] is the very event which retroactively caused global existential [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]abatement[[/span]] failure.

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]04/21 █6:██ |[[/span]] ███X-MCD/II (the &#34;Paradox Exodus Engine&#34;) is co-opted by rogue AI, causing it and Dr. PHMD.&#39;s demanifestation from consensus reality. Dr. Reynders&#39; further attempts to contact him are unsuccessful.

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]04/21 ██:██ |[[/span]] Dr. Deering is interrupted mid-harangue by the spontaneous re-activation of [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]SCP-7243[[/span]]. All internal cores hyper-activate, triggering chronological reinforcement contingency protocols. Dr. Reynders orders the immediate shutdown of [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]SCP-7243[[/span]] via analog manual override. Maintenance personnel report confusion as [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]AAF-X[[/span]]&#39;s P. A. system broadcasts conflicting instructions in a near-perfect imitation of Dr. Reynders&#39; voice.

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]04/21 ██:██ |[[/span]] Dr. Deering approaches Chief [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]Torosyan-[[/span]]Deering, procures a heavily modified TAD //[*/scp-6500/offset/15 jumpwatch]// from his uniform pocket, and begins tapping it in frantic rhythm. Dr. Reynders exclaims, pulling Dr. Deering toward herself and attempting to stop him. The device activates, causing both to disappear.

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]04/21 ██:██ |[[/span]] As [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]SCP-7243[[/span]]&#39;s latent stores of extant [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]effluence[[/span]] (and paradoxically-reinstated non-[[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]effluence[[/span]]) approach critical [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]recondicity[[/span]], an intense red hue begins to permeate [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]AAF-X[[/span]]. Multiple possible iterations of Drs. [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]McInnis[[/span]] and [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]Ngo[[/span]] manifest and overlap, signaling an imminent Copenhagen decoherence event. Chief [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]Torosyan-[[/span]]Deering vocalizes distress, and quickly exits [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]AAF-X[[/span]].

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]04/21 ██:██ |[[/span]] Local time (as measured by all electronic devices) cycles rapidly through the calendar year. [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]SCP-7243[[/span]]&#39;s scheduled automatic reference check triggers one hundred and twenty-two times in quick succession. Apparitions of Dr. Deering, who remains absent, attempt to override this every three seconds. In his absence between attempts, the override is deemed inauthentic. [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]The device[[/span]] is unable to locate sufficient anchors for its definitive chronology, and is forced to utilize a probabilistic metric; multiple attempted microadjustments overlap in local spacetime. A large film projector reel manifests within Dr. [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]Ngo[[/span]]&#39;s skull, killing her instantly. Iterations of Dr. [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]McInnis[[/span]] draw concealed weapons and fire upon each other simultaneously. Maintenance personnel begin to sever their own fingers, and uncontrollably consume the lost blood.

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]04/21 ██:██ |[[/span]] A fourth sublevel manifests between [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]Site-43[[/span]] and [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]AAF-X[[/span]], containing [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]two elderly humanoid figures[[/span]]. They are immediately aerosolized by ambient thaumic bloom and incorporated into a coruscating halo suffusing the bedrock. [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]Acroamatic[[/span]] decontainment events increase in frequency and severity sevenfold.

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]04/21 ██:██ |[[/span]] Chief [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]Torosyan-[[/span]]Deering sprints down a narrow hallway toward the Emergency [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]Acroamatic Redundancy[[/span]] Bunker. [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]She[[/span]] trips over [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]the corpse of[[/span]] Chief [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]A.

&#34;Nexus-7243&#34; is a designation. [[span style=&#34;filter: opacity(0.66)&#34;]]--This designation was created to reference [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]a location[[/span]]--

[[/span]]

This designation (hereafter AO-&#34;NX-7243&#34;) was created to facilitate communication [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]regarding its reference[[/span]]. However, AO-&#34;NX-7243&#34;&#39;s intended usage is rendered impossible, as it is subject to an [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]intense dissociative[[/span]] effect. [[span style=&#34;filter: opacity(0.66);&#34;]]--Any attempt to propagate data regarding AO-&#34;NX-7243&#34;&#39;s [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]reference is targeted by the [[/span]]--[[/span]]

--The effect [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]is self-affecting[[/span]]--
--The effect [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]cannot meaningfully be described[[/span]]--
[[/span]]

AO-&#34;NX-7243&#34;&#39;s intended usage is inhibited by an effect. Said inhibition is not apparently caused by any of the following effects, in isolation:

* lesser antimemetic effect (un-retainable)
* greater antimemetic effect (incomprehensible)
* semiontological hazard
* cognitohazard
* narrativohazard
* localized micro-CK-Class &#34;communicative retcon&#34;
* miscellaneous chronological shift

[[/&gt;]]

Due to the recent influx of highly deviant artificial intelligences, the role of digital subterfuge in the effect cannot be ruled out; supposing there is none, it would stand to reason that AO-&#34;NX-7243&#34;&#39;s intended usage is inhibited at a fundamental informational level, possibly a macroscopic quantum phenomenon. [[span style=&#34;filter: opacity(0.66);&#34;]]--This inhibition extends to any alternative designation which would share its [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]item of reference[[/span]] with [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]that[[/span]] of AO-&#34;NX-72--[[/span]]

In any case, the phenomenon propagates to any term whose intended function is uniquely and practically similar to that of AO-&#34;NX-7243&#34;.

[[span class=&#34;st&#34;]]FOREWORD:[[/span]] I&#39;ve been with the Foundation long enough to recognize when I&#39;m only begrudgingly consulted, and that&#39;s what&#39;s happening here. Despite the fact that I am the world&#39;s premier expert on the present subject, despite my possession of firsthand knowledge regarding the disaster which rendered it supposedly indescribable, and despite my persistent entreaties to be looped into the research and containment process, I have been stonewalled at every turn until the utmost end of alternative resources.

I, Dr. Dougall Alton Deering, once stood at the head of a scientific project second in importance to none on this Earth. We faced an Anomalous waste crisis of unprecedented and ever-escalating scale, and my staff and I were charged with its amelioration. Here is my precise, cogent, one hundred percent accurate explanation of how that worked -- and what, through no fault of my own, went wrong with it.

----

[[span class=&#34;st&#34;]]DESCRIPTION:[[/span]] [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]Site-43 is the designation for a facility constructed one kilometre beneath Ipperwash Provincial Park in Lambton County,[[/span]] Ontario, Canada [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]for research and containment operations, the most vital of which was the advancement of Acroamatic Abatement: neutralization of esoteric effluence. Site-43 contained four of the most advanced AcroAbate facilities on Earth, though there existed[[/span]] multiple satellite facilities [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]at other Sites and Areas internationally. Our tireless efforts resulted in a stalemate with this implacable opponent, until in a moment of personal inspiration I was able to devise a novel abatement method which could permanently terminate the matter in question via the application of advanced parascience.[[/span]]

[[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]I enlisted the aid of Chief Amelia Torosyan-Deering to construct a device we termed the DePLExA Engine, after consultation with various external experts (including Dr. Ilse Reynders and Dr. Placeholder McDoctorate). The device eventuated[[/span]] my [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]prime[[/span]] aspiration [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]for Anomalous waste: that it be conceptually[[/span]] erased [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]from existence, as though it had never existed in the first place. Effluence went into the engine,[[/span]] and nothing came out, [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]and retrocausally nothing went in,[[/span]] resulting in [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]a paradox that powered the machine itself. It was elegant, flawless, and effective. We had beaten back the beast. We had ended the[[/span]] crisis.

[[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]My shortsighted consultants -- or if not shortsighted, then actively malicious -- caused the device to be deactivated at a[[/span]] critical [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]moment. This allowed the original course of causality to retroactively resume, and we experienced a total effluence maximalization effect unabated by any other mechanisms, which in short[[/span]] order [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]caused Site-43 and Nexus-94 within which it is situated to be[[/span]] stricken [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]from consensus reality.[[/span]]

[[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering and I witnessed these events.[[/span]] I attempted [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]to escape with her in order to help coordinate disaster mitigation and relief efforts, but Dr. Reynders interfered in[[/span]] a selfish bid [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]to preserve her own existence and we were instead transported from the facility together.[[/span]]

[[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]The conceptually[[/span]] null [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]space you call Nexus-7243 is Site-43 and Nexus-94. They still exist. And it[[/span]] is my duty [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]to restore them.[[/span]]

Unlike my colleagues, I do NOT shirk my responsibilities.

* containment facilities are to be constructed surrounding any known interior bounds of Nexus-00, where feasible;
* the Department of Esoteric Reduction is responsible for the maintenance of such facilities (chiefly, Outpost-7243), and associated research;
* the Logistics Branch is to continue utilizing pre-existing infrastructure for the collection of esoteric waste substances, whether extant or //in absentia//, and their transportation to Outpost-7243;
* the Department of Esoteric Reduction must oversee the safe disposal of said esoteric waste via its ejection from Nexus-00.

[[span class=&#34;st&#34;]]DESCRIPTION:[[/span]] &#34;Nexus-00&#34; designates consensus reality: all that which is observably, measurably extant and compatible with our universe. This includes any other extrauniversal space which is tethered to, or interfaces with, our reality in a coherent fashion. Any region which can successfully be referenced within consensus reality is, itself, an extension of consensus reality, and therefore comprises Nexus-00.

Nexus-00 is of course not a single contiguous, continuous physical surface. It incorporates various physically-disconnected locales which are at least informationally-adjacent to consensus reality. However, it has been evidenced to Our Foundation that the manifold of our local universe (Nexus-00-A) also possesses points and/or boundaries of informational discontinuity. These discontinuities are not to be confused with embedded pocket-universes (ie. a black hole&#39;s interior), nor [*/scp-3930 regions of non-existence], nor extreme antimemetic influence, nor local breakdown of conventional physics, nor **##green|hazardous nomenclative influence##**; all such regions can still be referenced, however circuitously, within the manifold of Nexus-00.

Instead, these discontinuities demarcate the bounds of what can be referenced from within Nexus-00. To restate, as clearly as the subject will allow: 

* consensus reality consists solely of space which can be referenced within consensus reality;
* consensus reality possesses internal informational discontinuities;
* some such discontinuous boundaries are embedded //within// the interior space of //physical// reality, despite marking the bounds of //informational// reality.

A hypothetical region existing outside Nexus-00 would be impossible to reference, even in a statement which attempts to explain the impossibility of its being referenced. An extreme degree of vagueness, implication, and definition-in-the-negative is fundamentally required in order to express discrepancies between our physical and informational realities, as any truth statement regarding the physical nature of such a discrepancy is definitionally incompatible with the informational makeup of our universe.

Functionally, the &#34;Nexus-00&#34; designation is utilized as an inverse[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Not a mathematical inverse, but the complementary set.[[/span]] of the deprecated &#34;Nexus-7243&#34; designation (aka. AO-&#34;NX-7243&#34;) as the latter does not refer.

[[span class=&#34;st&#34;]]ORIGIN:[[/span]] Both prior to and contemporaneous with efforts to resolve the global fallout of [[span class=&#34;table5 st&#34;]]INCIDENT 6488-D/I[[/span]], a staggering increase in the production of esoteric waste substances was reported by all Containment Areas and Sites. Apparently coincidentally, the Logistics Branch noted an inexplicable surplus of infrastructure for esoteric substance collection and distribution. Thusly equipped to supply a hundredfold increase in esoteric waste processing systems, Logistics attempted construction of requisite emergency duplicates. It however gradually became clear that all schematics, blueprints, and methodological descriptions of extant waste processing systems had become subject to __an effect__, assumed to be a by-product of the aforementioned incident.

As these systems could not be reverse-engineered, duplicate systems could not be constructed, nor could similar novel systems be designed, as __an effect__ pervaded all attempts. Our Foundation&#39;s understanding of esoteric waste was found to be strikingly underdeveloped, and all relevant pre-existing technologies had been rendered incomprehensible. Analytical and communicative struggles were exacerbated by constant interference from rogue AI agents, prohibiting any combined effort to properly contend with redundant Anomalous substances.

In the wake of the ongoing LOTUS crisis, a critical global buildup of these substances could not be afforded. Despite an incomplete understanding of its former waste disposal solutions, the Logistics Branch elected to, as a stopgap measure, re-engage its global supply network and temporarily resume the delivery of esoteric substances to __a discontinuity__ in Nexus-00. Despite the reactivation of LOTUS on 2036/08/14, __an effect__ persisted, and was also encountered in attempting to conceptualize, describe, and measure the nature of this discontinuity, prompting the creation of both Outpost-7243 and this file.

After consultation with Researcher Emeritus Dr. D. Deering, who had spent much of his retirement independently investigating the properties and detoxification of esoteric waste substances, he and a selection of [*/secure-facility-dossier-area-12 Area-12]&#39;s research staff were organized into the Department of Esoteric Reduction and tasked with the indefinite maintenance of Outpost-7243.

[[span class=&#34;st&#34;]]ADDENDUM 2038/01/01:[[/span]] Despite the effectiveness of Project Sargasso[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]An initiative to reproduce the functioning of lost artificially-intelligent conscripts via the amnesticization and psychological reconditioning of organic consciousnesses.[[/span]] in identifying and remediating the infrastructural damage and Anomalous phenomena produced by rogue AI agents, __an effect__ could neither be rectified nor better analyzed by OCI systems. Per recommendation of Chief Esoteric Reductionist Dr. D. Deering, and given the absence of a more effective solution, this file&#39;s Interaction Protocols have been permanently instated as standard esoteric waste disposal procedure.

[[span class=&#34;st&#34;]]ADDENDUM 2042/06/01:[[/span]] The neutralization of LOTUS on 2042/05/08, and subsequent reconstitution of associated conceptual structures, has not observably alleviated __an effect__ which its initial deactivation seemingly instigated. Esoteric Polymath Place H. MD., PhD., having returned to the local timeline following the deactivation of LOTUS, is (expectedly) unable to provide context pertaining to his correspondence with Dr. I. Reynders during Incident 6488-D/II. Both agree that interference and impersonation by rogue AI was responsible for any logical discrepancies.

Journal entry for 2042/08/14, Dr. Dougall Deering.

[[div class=&#34;papernote dd&#34;]]
I don&#39;t give a fuck what anyone else thinks. Nobody -- not //anybody// -- has lived with this subject longer than I have. Not even Reynders. Maybe I didn&#39;t invent the science. Maybe I didn&#39;t get a seven-decade crash course on the workings of the universe before I had to stick my oar in. But I&#39;m the first person to attempt a solution, a real and lasting //solution,// to this problem. Everyone before me was just laying track, and that doesn&#39;t take much imagination. Me? I&#39;ve been imagining what the terminal looks like for thirty years.

Maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;m the only one who still remembers. Not the O5s with their mnestics, not Antimemetics, not even the damn Deepwells! Me. Only me. Because there&#39;s nothing to me except this problem. You can&#39;t separate us and have anything left over.

Or maybe I&#39;m being punished again. In this world, that&#39;s reason enough.

But I don&#39;t care. I can handle punishment. I can handle all these small-minded idiots treating me like a fool. I&#39;ve been ignored before. It&#39;s my talent. And while they&#39;re passing me by on their way from nowhere to nothing, I&#39;ll be working to the goal, just like always. Just like [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]she[[/span]] would be, and maybe still [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]is[[/span]].

I&#39;m pouring every waking moment into the black hole that swallowed everything I love, and here&#39;s what I hear rattling around down there in response:

[[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]Site-43[[/span]] still exists.

And I&#39;m going to get you out of there, [[span class=&#34;diss&#34;]]Amelia[[/span]].

|| [[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]17:18:22[[/span]] || A large container of esoteric waste is delivered to Outpost-7243 by a Mk. XI Logistics Crawler. It is offloaded and pumped through a specialized culvert to be neutralized as per Nexus Interaction Protocols. ||
|| [[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]18:21:13[[/span]] || As the waste passes outside of consensus reality, Outpost-7243 records a 3.8 magnitude earthquake apparently originating from a location beyond the bounds of Nexus-00. ||

[[span class=&#34;st&#34;]]SUMMARY:[[/span]] EE-001 was a ϝK-Class &#34;Paradoxysm&#34; Scenario, primarily featuring an extreme, localized, metastable Copenhagen decoherence event. This event involved the overlap of many different possible chronologies which interacted with a multitude of paradoxes, retrocausal quanta generated by said paradoxes, acroamatic quanta dispensed into Research and Containment Site-43, and other miscellaneous factors to prompt a Zero-Sum Localized Event Collapse. This was later followed by a Localized Event Rebound. From the baseline perspective, the totality of EE-001 took place over a period of seven years, four months, eighteen days, during which time Site-43 was near-fully detached and dissociated from consensus reality. Data recovered following EE-001 suggests an interior temporal progression of precisely six years.

EE-001 was induced by an attack on Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-X&#39;s systems by a faction of deviant artificial intelligences released into cyberspace by the deactivation of SCP-6488 (RAIDFRAME VIII, &#34;LOTUS&#34;). SCP-7243 (DePLExA) detected this attack, recognized it as an Alpha priority, and resorted to its default emergency behavior: to seek out the individuals on whom it is causally-dependent (in this case, all members of ATF ϝ-7243), and reinforce its chronology using their personal histories as &#34;guideposts.&#34; In short, DePLExA combatted what its systems viewed as an imminent CK-Class event by attempting to draw out the statistically &#34;true&#34; version of itself from the past actions, memories, and experiences of ATF ϝ-7243, and projected this version of reality over its present existence, which it understood to be compromised by outside forces. Had a sufficient number of causally-dependent personnel been present at this time, and had local instability not resulted in the rapid overlap of over one hundred failed anchoring attempts, DePLExA would have succeeded in its task.

Instead, ATF ϝ-7243 members D. Deering, P. Deering, Place H. MD., A. McInnis, N. Ngo, I. Reynders, and A. Torosyan-Deering were all unavailable, owing either to death, non-attendance, or incapacitation, and so DePLExA failed to determine a suitable alternate version of reality with which to replace itself. Its systems therefore attempted to construct a version of events wherein none of the aforementioned individuals were involved in its creation, or even, alternatively, in the history of Site-43; this resulted in SCP-7243 summing numerous contradictory facts and projecting them as objective truths to be realized simultaneously. Correspondingly, Site-43 and the greater Nexus-94 rapidly fell out of sync with the remainder of the universe and dissociated to an estimated 98% completeness. It is theorized that this effect was so all-encompassing that it could not be corrected by a naturally-occurring CK or ZK-Class Event, which may have been triggered multiple times during the process.

DePLExA, now isolated with the rest of Nexus-94 in an uncompassable, extra-ontological location, its functions expedited by surviving on-site personnel, modelled an uncountable number of irregular chronological paths, systematically eliminating any options which contradicted its core directives. It was able to identify a preferable chronology within a distorted period equivalent to roughly seven years.

The force of Nexus-94&#39;s recoherence was sufficient to overpower the influence of any remaining temporal paradoxes. Following a sharp increase in the appearance of new matter, the entire Nexus was reconstituted in the span of a single day.

In the wake of Site-43&#39;s original decoherence on 2036/04/21, the Department of Esoteric Reduction was established to compensate for the loss of the Acroamatic Abatement Section, its methods, and its institutional knowledge. Esoteric Reduction constructed Outpost-7243 at the local limits of Nexus-00 as a headquarters for the monitoring of the dissociated zone, as well as a logistics hub managing the transport of esoteric effluence to Nexus-94. Though the Nexus did not conventionally exist at this time, waste could still be moved into it via a decommissioned pipeline believed to have once carried platonic material to Acroamatic Abatement Facility [/scp-5520 AAF-W]. For reasons which remain obscure, this pipeline had not fully dissociated.

For almost the entirety of the span of Nexus-94&#39;s decoherence it had been injected with vast quantities of esoteric waste from across the globe. Lacking a feasible alternative or the experience necessary to formulate one, Esoteric Reduction was allowed to proceed with this arrangement indefinitely. Data recovered subsequent to EE-001 suggests that the majority of this waste was successfully ameliorated by surviving personnel within the discontinuity. Upon the incident of Site-43&#39;s return to consensus reality, the remaining waste was absorbed into the environment at rapid speed, mixing and fusing with the remaining volatile acroamatic and retrocausal quanta within the Site to concoct a disastrous chain reaction.

A protective energy shield was deployed over Nexus-94. This contained the deleterious effects of the impending reaction, but did nothing to preserve its contents. Minutes after the shield was deployed a cataclysmic explosion of esoteric waste and condensed antichronons atomized what remained of Site-43. The energy shield now overhangs a vast, cavernous pit.

Cleanup operations discovered a single member of Site personnel unconscious but alive at the perimeter of Nexus-94.

= //&lt;Chief Torosyan-Deering is standing in the operations control room of Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-X. She has activated DePLExA&#39;s referent seeking mechanism for the four hundred and eighty-sixth time. The program runs, and spatial flexures are visible through the observation glass. A klaxon sounds.&gt;//

= //&lt;The chronological stability indicator flashes green.&gt;//

= //&lt;The floor beneath Chief Torosyan-Deering&#39;s feet disappears for ten frames of camera footage, during which the chasms below are visible and she falls toward the centre of the Earth. She experiences this as a sudden jolt, and staggers back; the soles of her boots are now detached, fused with the reformed floor.&gt;//

= //&lt;Chief Torosyan-Deering watches as the cavern in which AAF-X is situated continues to contract and expand, the machinery within shrinking and enlarging in opposite rhythm. There is a sound of thunder, and she covers her ears with her hands. The bulkhead door behind her shatters like glass. DePLExA&#39;s visible component parts begin to red-shift.&gt;//

= //&lt;The floor and walls shake violently, and a fissure appears in the cavern ceiling beneath the foundations of Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-D. It glows amber. Chief Torosyan-Deering&#39;s diagnostics reveal that low-priority spectral material in a long term holding cycle  within the older facility has breached containment; it becomes visible as a steady downpour of amber fluid through the crack. The fluid coruscates, bends, and approaches the control room with apparent intent. Chief Torosyan-Deering leaps through the shattered door as the fluid-limb snakes through the observation glass, pursuing her.&gt;// 

= //&lt;She flees through the gradually reformulating ruins of AAF-X. A ruptured paraspectral grounding conduit arcs electricity into her uniform jacket, setting it ablaze with blue fire, and she tears it off without pausing her flight. There is a flash of amber, and she throws herself violently through the door into a side passage. The grasping spectral limb of her pursuer misses by millimetres.&gt;//

= //&lt;The floor disappears again, and does not immediately reformulate. Chief Torosyan-Deering falls into the next sublevel, landing in a pool of red blood corpuscles being churned by a series of adamantine whisks. The limb reaches down toward her as she scrambles to the lip of the pool, and she dives beneath the surface to avoid it. The ceiling above reformulates, and the limb is severed; the leading end disintegrates in a shower of amber sparks which hiss and sparkle as they strike the blood. Chief Torosyan-Deering surfaces, and pulls herself to safety. She staggers to her feet, and continues to flee as the walls begin to glow white-hot.&gt;//

= //&lt;A cloverleaf of seven identical passages meet at an open elevator shaft. Chief Torosyan-Deering is seen approaching it from each passage; each iteration is moving at a different rate of speed, displaying injuries consistent with different trauma. Running blind, each iteration apparently fails to notice the others. The iteration presently filming reaches the elevator first, leaps into it, and activates the ascension controls. The remaining instances are caught by the attacking limb, which gathers them up as one. They melt into ectoplasm as the elevator rises into the ceiling and visual contact is again lost.&gt;//

= //&lt;This sublevel of AAF-X is shimmering red. An automated emergency message begins to play.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Recorded Voice of Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] Chronological reinforcement is fifty percent complete. Irrealism factor is seven: ontocaustic.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Indicating a level of divergence between internal and external conceptual spaces which cannot be reconciled without the annihilation of all intervening matter.[[/span]] Evacuation is advised, where possible.

= //&lt;The message repeats seven times, gaining one additional voice in chorus with each repetition: I. Reynders, A. McInnis, N. Ngo, Place. H. MD., P. Deering, and D. Deering.&gt;//

= //&lt;Chief Torosyan-Deering emerges into the cavern proper, moving at speed over a series of catwalks which thread between towering factory stacks and storage tanks. Each is now translucent and filled with bubbling liquids in a variety of different colors. Electrical explosions occur in the distance, across the pit at the core of DePLExA and approaching Chief Torosyan-Deering&#39;s person; the resultant sounds appear to occur in reverse. The roof of the cavern begins to shimmer, and the roots of the clearcut forest above are clearly visible along with the external membrane of Site-43, the topside elevators, and the fractally warped remains of the surface refinery facilities. The assailant is visible above, winding through windows and doors, over tracks and gantries, searching for its prey. Chief Torosyan-Deering gasps in pain, severely winded, as she reaches the ingress tunnel to the disposal pit. The assailant snaps to attention and begins snaking toward her, partially obscured by piping and machinery.&gt;//

= //&lt;Chief Torosyan-Deering clambers onto an empty wastecarte and sets it moving in reverse. The tracks at the pit terminus begin to deform like rubber, the deformation spreading as the explosions grow in intensity and volume. The carte exits Site-43 and enters a system of circuitous [[[SCP-5494]]] tunnels, rapidly outpacing the assailant. A persistent prismatic glow advancing from the cavern outpaces it as well, and it disappears. The carte automatically ascends a series of switchbacks, shaking violently as the tracks elasticize and vulcanize. Chief Torosyan-Deering begins to weep.&gt;//

= //&lt;The wastecarte emerges at Depot-43 on the eastern fringe of Nx-94, and Chief Torosyan-Deering leaps off as it passes through the terminal station, strikes the platform and disintegrates. Visible light is a pale grey, and all moving objects do so sluggishly and with lingering motion trails. She pulls herself hand over hand over the platform and out of the station, then staggers at a jog toward the distant fence. There is a sudden distortion on the video feed, and the grey illumination is replaced by moonlight. Chief Torosyan-Deering turns to look back as she passes through the unmanned security checkpoint. Her immediate surroundings are colour-tinted correctly, but the interior of the as-yet dissociated space remains greyscaled. A bubble of colour is expanding from Site-43, the colors inverted from the original dissociative event. As she watches, a ball of light originating from the sky cuts through the expanding starburst and coats the Nexus with a bubble of reflective plasma. Before the coverage is complete, the total obliteration of Site-43 from surface to AAF-X is visible. A single large amber tentacle thrashes in apparent distress and/or frustration as it coils around the lone surviving stack. The facility&#39;s explosion temporarily overwhelms the thaumic shield, casting luminous tendrils into the sky and lake which disappear in points of brilliant white.&gt;//

= //&lt;Chief Torosyan-Deering collapses, blocking the camera view.&gt;//

Waste is what you&#39;ve done with your life. With our lives. Potentially with every human life on Earth, //every// Earth. And for what? Pride. Selfishness. Misguided affection. The cost of that waste is incalculable.

Dougall Deering saved me. In a sense.

I&#39;d already been talking to my mirror for years. Staring myself in the face and asking what I should do. Imagining that my reflection was actually Phil&#39;s. Not because he was some wellspring of knowledge; he&#39;d have been the first to say that he put the &#39;J&#39; in &#39;J&amp;M&#39;. He was smart, smarter than he ever gave himself credit for, but he was no engineer. He fixed vending machines while I calibrated semioplasma correctors, handled technician schedules while I designed oriykalkos autodefactories. Anybody could have done his jobs, but it always meant everything to me that it was him. So every single day since he&#39;s been gone, I&#39;ve imagined I can see him in the mirror. Pushing me forward.

But it&#39;s only my memory of him. It&#39;s a strong memory, but it still isn&#39;t real. His ghost in my shell. For that first year trapped in the world&#39;s highest-stakes escape room I kept on imagining him, egging me on, urging me to survive. To find a way out, like Ilse did. But I&#39;d gone to the well too many times, and I knew how shallow it was. I knew he was gone, even if I couldn&#39;t admit it. It wasn&#39;t enough to keep living for a dead man.

So I let the picture shift, and focused on someone who wasn&#39;t dead.

I pictured Dougall Deering&#39;s smug smirk and dead eyes, and I blamed him for everything he deserved to be blamed for. Failing to excel when we needed excellence the most. Killing my husband. Digging himself a pity-pit and hiding in it. Begging me to forgive him. Making me think I might some day have a reason to do it. And then leaving us worse off than we&#39;d been before it started.

I used my hatred of him as a lodestar. My most powerful, unfailing, infinitely-renewable reality anchor. Every inch I clawed back from oblivion was getting me closer to exposing him as a fraud to the Council. Every grisly mess that popped back into existence in front of me, every body bifurcated by a wall, every screaming pile of gristle with its skin abstracted and its pain receptors shining in my flashlight beam was another mistake I could spit in his face, if only I held on a little longer. When I started powering up the machinery again and setting it to a task it was never designed to perform, and did the work of a hundred techs at once, and I ached and sweated and froze and the hole in my stomach where the need to eat and drink and defecate was gone, I told myself I was proving once and for all that us lowly technicians actually putting in the elbow grease could do things that effete fop had always been incapable of.

When my resolve slipped, I promised myself I&#39;d track down that supercilious twit and let him have it with both barrels, as a victory treat.

But every time I clawed out my new temporary haven after that damnable annual reset, I imagined what it would be like to dig myself out entirely and meet him digging inward from the other side, as I knew he would be, and I couldn&#39;t find my nerve. Maybe I&#39;d long since lost it. He&#39;d be trying, for the first time, actually trying, and also for the first time I found that wasn&#39;t nothing. Wasn&#39;t entirely without meaning.

I simply haven&#39;t got the energy to hate anymore. Hating him, and my prison, and this ridiculous unending nightmare-- it&#39;s burned through everything else I ever had. It&#39;s just him and me, now, and what he said in a puff of selfish navel-gazing is finally true: we understand each other.

[[span class=&#34;st&#34;]]UPDATE 2043/09/08:[[/span]] Analysis reveals that the volume of energy released during Nexus-94&#39;s Localized Event Rebound, while incredibly immense, did not nearly match the volume expected of such an expulsion.

Current data suggests that the most likely vector through which the excess energy may have escaped resides in the threshold between consensus reality and the decoherent space Nexus-94 was transposed to, meaning that it would have been released into extradimensional, possibly extrauniversal space.

If this is true, models suggest that the high velocity of the esoteric waste containing this energy would relieve Our Foundation of its harmful effects in their entirety; the quanta would be propelled far from baseline reality.

|| **SUMMARY:** A bolus of unabated conceptual matter appears within the corpse of Large Scale Aggressor Brasil-01, undergoing acroamatic abatement procedures at Area-16. In admixture with other substances processed at that facility, the bolus metastasizes within the corpse and instantiates what the local Foundation soon terms a &#34;conceptuokaiju&#34; resident in the logosphere. This entity promptly colonizes the realms of speech and cognition, preying and feeding on human mindfulness and assaulting linguistic structures and higher grammatical forms. Plans are underway for the instantiation of a counterconceptual linguistic device (&#34;mecha-verb&#34;) to combat it, code-named RED PEN.||

|| **SUMMARY:** The &#34;Mobius Stripper&#34; temporal matter reduction system, a recursive pipe array some seven kilometres in length within Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-D, vanishes. Subsequent timeplane and cosmosphere modelling renders suggest the system becomes multiversally abstracted, forming temporally-variable conduits between timeline [[span class=&#34;tl_id&#34;]]940662b90e78660244bce96e7776dc7f[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Canonical Bundle DW17 Timeline Delta-Blue; the subject of this audit.[[/span]] and a multitude of other timelines (and adjacent reality-spaces) under Metafoundation purview. These conduits are further reported to facilitate the unwelcome, interdimensional transference of various anomalous phenomena, particularly during emergent scenarios, adding an additional layer of chaos and unpredictability to those scenarios&#39; results. _

Further cross-temporal analysis has been deferred to the O9 Collective, per the importance of Iteration [[span class=&#34;tl_id&#34;]]00000000000000000000000000000000[[/span]] in Metafoundation affairs. ||

On 8 September 2036, Treatment Site-43 was excised from consensus reality. On 8 September 2043, it returned. Over the course of those seven years, temporally constricted to seventy-two months within that pocket of unreality, with no oversight, assistance, sustenance or sleep, the majority of the SCP Foundation&#39;s&#39;s acroamatic abatement procedures were carried out by one person: Chief Amelia Torosyan-Deering of Janitorial and Maintenance. This is her testimony.

It needs to be foolproof. The last one failed because fools tampered with it. Human error cannot be a factor, or if it is, its influence needs to be isolated to things that can&#39;t destabilize our reality. If our solution threatens the stability of our own conceptual space, it&#39;s no better than the problem.

O5-11 confirms the absence of any notable backlash effects, and the project will continue as planned through Q4 at the least.

Precautions have been taken to ensure the events of incident 7243-1 cannot recur.

Area-21 has received multiple requests from other Foundation facilities to implement limited local MAGIC DRAWER devices at key points in the global Logistics network. Due to the nature of MAGIC DRAWER, however, and the high degree of technical ability required to operate and maintain it, these requests have necessarily been denied. We acknowledge that the present solution does not provide the same expansive and proactive coverage of its predecessor, forcing the resumption of small-scale abatement processes to maintain equilibrium, and constant innovation in that field; to that end, we have chosen to pursue a collaborative rather than unilateral approach.

[[span class=&#34;st&#34;]]PURPOSE:[[/span]] Permanently, robustly, and sustainably eliminate the deleterious effects of redundant esoteric waste substances on consensus reality, at sufficient scale to compensate for the indefinite exponential growth of contained subjects and their by-products.

[[span class=&#34;st&#34;]]ABSTRACT:[[/span]] Typical mechanisms of esoteric reduction -- such as those presented in the practice of acroamatic abatement -- are dependent upon the detoxifying properties of an Anomalously-stable copper isotope occurring naturally[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Insofar as it is generated by the presence of [*/scp-5494 another, uncontained Anomalous subject].[[/span]] within the waters of Lake Huron, which has been infeasible to artificially reproduce. As the quantity and volatility of esoteric waste has seen exponential increase over the Foundation&#39;s lifespan, the aforementioned method has approached minimal effectiveness, and can neither be localized nor replicated at sufficient scale without the entirety of Huron&#39;s lakewater soon being spent.

An alternative method of esoteric reduction, known as &#39;existential abatement&#39;, has been proposed and implemented per insistence of the Pilcrow-Minkowski Center for Multidisciplinary Studies; this over-engineered, profoundly unstable method sought to circumvent the inception of Anomalous waste by instantiating self-justifying, metastable micro-paradoxes which were harnessed in the retroactive erasure of certain substances under extremely precise conditions. The inherent truculence of this approach inevitably led to its failure -- expedited by its premature deactivation, leaving it vulnerable to commandeerment by rogue AI agents -- which has resulted in:

* the loss of Site-43, its personnel, its infrastructure and contributions, its contained subjects, and the nation of Japan; 
* the sudden and global resurgence of the esoteric waste substances crisis;
* multiple breaches of baseline reality&#39;s ontokinetic and chronological integrity;
* a cascade hazardous materials breach of multiversal proportion.

The Department of Esoteric Reduction fundamentally rejects the pursuit of any such experimental solution, and so has worked closely with the P. M. Center to develop a well-tested, robust, rigorous methodology which will ensure the stable ejection of esoteric waste substances from consensus reality.

----

[[span class=&#34;st&#34;]]METHOD:[[/span]] Esoteric waste substances are to be ejected from consensus reality.

As these substances are inherently unpredictable and highly reactive with other Anomalous phenomena, attempts to ectoentropically erase or detoxify them have been rejected. Similarly, the hypothetical informational space &#39;between&#39; or &#39;outside of&#39; conventional universes has not been shown to meaningfully exist, and so attempting to send Anomalous substances to that space would be an experimental approach of unprecedented consequences. After much deliberation, it is evident that the only acceptable solution with which to proceed is the ejection of esoteric waste substances into parallel universes.

This process must be executed such that the impact on recipient timelines is minimal and undetected, as the recipients&#39; Foundations (or alternate Normalcy organizations) might otherwise become hostile to the baseline Foundation. To achieve this, ejected substances should be evenly distributed across a wide range of timelines in small, concentrated quantities; they should also be delivered to precise locations (and times) wherein their esoteric properties will swiftly be abated by local forces. The feasibility of this approach is attested by the uncontrolled dispersal of acroamatic material across the timeplane during the EE-001 &#34;rubberband&#34; event of 2043, which now stands as this project&#39;s initial test case. Controlled and targeted dispersal can only excel these results.

The Department of Esoteric Reduction proposes the creation of an industrial eigenmachine, stationed at Area-21, which performs the following procedure:

* esoteric waste substances delivered by extant global logistics networks will be sorted by their attributes and properties, as they would be in conventional acroamatic abatement methods, then compactified into concentrated &#39;packets&#39;;
* an extrauniversal imaging mechanism, designed by the P. M. Center in conjunction with Esoteric Polymath P. H. MD., PhD., will generate a &#39;timeplane-curve map&#39; describing all timelines which possess an iteration of Site-43 (or suitable equivalent);
* every seventy-two days, for each waste packet, the next sequential timeline in the timeplane-curve map will be identified and targeted; this map is hard-coded to avoid human error and is subject to a &#39;ratchet system&#39; which cannot be countermanded, as the intense thaumic backscatter produced by each packet deployment must be evenly distributed along the timeplane&#39;s heat-arc to avoid a potentially metapocalyptic imbalance;
* a temporary transdimensional Way will be initialized, linking baseline Area-21 to the appropriate section of the selected timeline&#39;s abatement facilities, at the time of minimal projected impact;
* the waste packet will be ejected from consensus reality through this Way, whereupon it will be sent to the recipient timeline and immediately abated alongside similar esoteric materials;
* the Way will then close, and the system will ratchet forward along the timeplane map in anticipation of the next deployment.

Technical specifications and resource requirements will be presented in full to relevant parties as needed.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] Where in our past is this packet going?

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] MAGIC DRAWER selects whatever the most...

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] What? What&#39;s wrong?

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] It can&#39;t.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] What can&#39;t?

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] What? Doug, what&#39;s wrong?

= //&lt;Dr. Deering stands up abruptly. The chair spins away across the aisle.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] No! No. We&#39;re not doing this.

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]Dr. Reynders:[[/span]] It&#39;s already been done. The past is a pact, Dougall. 

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] No.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] Wait.

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]Dr. Reynders:[[/span]] We need to send something Anomalous through the aperture, and we need to do it soon. We can&#39;t destabilize the cosmos for this.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] //&lt;muttering&gt;// You think this is the cosmos being //stable?//

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] WAIT.

= //&lt;Silence on recording.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] I won&#39;t do it, Amelia. I didn&#39;t...

= //&lt;Dr. Deering sags.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] I didn&#39;t do it. It wasn&#39;t //me.//

= //&lt;Chief Torosyan-Deering convenes the primary operational staff of Area-21 to review the data from MAGIC DRAWER and determine whether the executive interpretation of the packet delivery target site is correct. It is unanimously agreed that the device is preparing to transport esoteric effluence to Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-D on 8 September, 2028.&gt;//

----

= //&lt;The executive staff have reconvened in the operations control room.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]]  This isn&#39;t a problem. It&#39;s an opportunity! We can... we can send something innocuous. Enough to get the job done, but not enough to kill him.

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]Dr. Reynders:[[/span]] Amelia...

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]]  No, just listen to me, okay? Okay?

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]Dr. Reynders:[[/span]] Okay, but we can&#39;t do it.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]]  Why not? //Why not?// We just discovered that Phil was never meant to die in the first place! //We caused it.// We can un-cause it! We can fix the whole thing, and all we have to do is whiff the next shot.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] You&#39;re saying //I// caused it.

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]Dr. Reynders:[[/span]] We, these versions of ourselves, everything we&#39;ve done -- with widespread multiversal consequences! -- are the products of Philip Deering&#39;s death. We can&#39;t create a toxic uber-paradox to save one human life.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]]  We&#39;re meant to fix this! It&#39;s a one in a million... no, an //indescribably unlikely// coincidence that we&#39;d end up targeting ourselves. What could explain that, outside of fate?

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]Dr. Reynders:[[/span]] Every target is indescribably unlikely, particularly from the perspective of each.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] She&#39;s right, Ilse. There&#39;s just no way we&#39;re the next recipient on blind luck. It would be the single greatest probabilistic outlier ever recorded. Even //theorized.//

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]Dr. Reynders:[[/span]] Yes. It&#39;s infinitely more likely that something went wrong with the machine, and it failed to model the timeplane curve correctly; theoretically, we should be the &#39;end&#39; of the arc.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] More mistakes.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] No. Don&#39;t even.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] I wasn&#39;t--

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Don&#39;t say it! I&#39;m telling you, //this wasn&#39;t me.// Place did the calculations. We need to call him.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] Place? Are you serious?

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]Dr. Reynders:[[/span]] I&#39;ve been trying, Dougall. He&#39;s gone silent. //Again.//

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Fuck! //FUCK!// How long do we have?

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] Two hours and change. Long enough to debate the solution.

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]Dr. Reynders:[[/span]] There&#39;s nothing to debate.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] There is. Ilse, Doug, we //can// save him. 

= //&lt;She takes Dr. Deering&#39;s shoulders in her hands.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] We work miracles every day. If you burned the braincells in this room, you could power Toronto for a lifetime. 

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]Dr. Reynders:[[/span]] No.

= //&lt;Chief Torosyan-Deering turns her head to face Dr. Reynders.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] I crawled my way out of Hell for this chance. To do right by someone I love. Tell me you don&#39;t understand that, //Ilse,// and remember why I was there in the first place.

= //&lt;Dr. Reynders opens her mouth, then looks away and does not respond. Chief Torosyan-Deering turns back to Dr. Deering.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] We can bring him back.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Maybe...

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] Yes. You know it&#39;s right. It makes //sense.//

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]Dr. Reynders:[[/span]] We can&#39;t.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] We //can.// We can start over!

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]Dr. Reynders:[[/span]] AMELIA!

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] I NEED MY HUSBAND BACK!

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] I&#39;m sorry, Doug.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] It&#39;s okay.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] I&#39;m so sorry.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] It&#39;s okay. I knew, of course.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] I... look, I didn&#39;t...

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]Dr. Reynders:[[/span]] I can&#39;t spare you two a moment. You know that. We&#39;re out of time to waste. We need to decide how we&#39;re going to handle this.

= //&lt;Silence on recording.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] We need to let him go.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] That&#39;s only part of it.

= //&lt;Dr. Deering calls a recess to allow the Historioglyphics Division to compare the next packet with the reported contents of Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-D on 8 September 2028. Chief Torosyan-Deering and Dr. Reynders are engaged in conversation within the former&#39;s office when they are alerted to the powerup of MAGIC DRAWER by a momentary power fluctuation. They return to the operations control room to find Dr. Deering absent; a brief search locates him within the maintenance access corridor to the device&#39;s delivery aperture. Chief Torosyan-Deering rushes to the outer door, finding it locked, while Dr. Reynders remains in operations control.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] What are you doing?

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] I know you can hear me. Dougall!

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]Dr. Reynders:[[/span]] He&#39;s overriding the safeties.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] Why?

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]Dr. Reynders:[[/span]] He&#39;s going to--

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] No. Absolutely not.

= //&lt;She hammers on the porthole, breaking the skin on her right hand in the process.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] DOUGALL! What the fuck are you--

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] Stop! Stop! We can work this out. Talk to me, or I swear on his memory I&#39;m going to shut the whole system down.

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]Dr. Reynders:[[/span]] You can&#39;t do that.

= //&lt;Dr. Deering turns to face Chief Torosyan-Deering.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] You can&#39;t do that.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] Watch me.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] We don&#39;t mean you //can&#39;t// do that, really. We&#39;re saying it&#39;s the wrong move. Amelia, I&#39;m sorry. I thought this would be easier if you and I didn&#39;t... didn&#39;t talk again.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] You always want to do it the easy way.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] I&#39;m making up for it now.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] You say that, but from where I&#39;m standing, you&#39;re about to give up and leave us to fix the mess you made. How is that not the easy way out?

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] I know what killed Phil.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] You&#39;ve always known what killed Phil. And so have I.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Exactly.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] What?

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] I killed Phil. 

= //&lt;Dr. Deering taps his chest.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] //I// killed Phil. And this is how I did it.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] Come out here, and let&#39;s discuss.

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]Dr. Reynders:[[/span]] The ramifications of what you&#39;re suggesting--

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] I&#39;m not suggesting anything. This is what happened. The thing that coiled around him did so for a reason. It ignored me. It went for him. It solved the problem.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] Solved the...?

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] That&#39;s why I&#39;m the only one who could see it, at first. //It was me.//

= //&lt;Dr. Deering spreads his hands wide.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] I&#39;m the loop.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] That doesn&#39;t... 

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] This packet is one hundred percent paraspectral. It&#39;s the extra material that showed up after Phil flushed AAF-D, the stuff nobody could account for. It&#39;s the source of the thing that took his life. And that thing behaved with //purpose,// Amelia.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] That doesn&#39;t mean you have to...

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] It does, though. The loop is stable, so long as we get this next part right. Otherwise...

= //&lt;Dr. Deering looks up at the ceiling of the chamber.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] //Paradox//, Ilse.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] What&#39;s he talking about?

= //&lt;Dr. Reynders hesitates for a moment, then speaks.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]Dr. Reynders:[[/span]] Phil dying set all of this in motion, and it&#39;s cross-multiversal now. Phil has to die again. He always has to die. And it has to be a sure thing.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Meaning we need control at the moment of crisis. What we send needs to have //agency.// And a shot of undifferentiated ectoplasm hasn&#39;t got that.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] What makes you think you won&#39;t just melt into nothing when the packet pours in on you?

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] I suppose... I probably will. But I know that won&#39;t be the end of it. Because I saw myself. I saw myself draw in the extra energy, take... take Phil, and then pass back into the pipes. 

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] But why does it have to be //you?//

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Because he&#39;s my brother. And this time I&#39;m going to show up for him.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] But it doesn&#39;t make SENSE! Ilse, hold on. Try to shut this thing down. You guys aren&#39;t thinking this through rationally. Why would //that// be the loop? Why would you turn yourself into something that would kill your own brother?

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Because the packet would have killed him instead, and then it would have blown the whole place sky-high, me included, and as far as anyone would know it would have all been Phil&#39;s fault. Instead, something sucked up the effluence in the air, then took him... 

= //&lt;His eyes widen.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] I remember thinking he hadn&#39;t felt it. That he didn&#39;t suffer. Maybe it gave him that. And then it saved the Site, gave my old self the chance to turn the valve, start my penance. Then it disappeared into the system... 

= //&lt;Dr. Deering laughs.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] And you know what? I bet it was still in there back in &#39;43. 2043.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] I saw it.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] What?

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] I saw it. It leaked down into DePLExA from AAF-D. It tried to kill me, too. On my last run through the cycle.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] That doesn&#39;t make sense. You couldn&#39;t see it on the video of Phil&#39;s acc-- of what happened to Phil.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] But I //could// see it in person when the chronology anchor started to work. When 43 rolled back to reality, it must&#39;ve been caught in the throes, concretized. It appeared, and it reached out for me...

= //&lt;Silence on recording.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Reached out for you.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] Oh my god.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Running in circles for fifteen years, trapped in the pipes, waiting for you to bring me back to life, so I could help you to survive. I like the symmetry.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] This can&#39;t be happening.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] At least this time, it really is my idea.

= //&lt;Chief Torosyan-Deering sags.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] Except you //didn&#39;t// help me to survive. You didn&#39;t do a //fucking thing// that helped me. 

= //&lt;She laughs.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] God, I should have known it was you.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] I&#39;m sorry.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] But you didn&#39;t answer my question. Why is this the loop? Phil only died because you did this. If he hadn&#39;t died, you never would have decided to do this. The logic doesn&#39;t work.

= //&lt;Dr. Deering shrugs.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] It happened, so it does work. The universe requires it to. Bootstrap paradox. Maybe the materials involved... they were ambichronological, remember? Time flowing both ways.

= //&lt;He shrugs again.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Or maybe that&#39;s looking too deep. Maybe Phil and I are just predestined to part, like... well.

= //&lt;Chief Torosyan-Deering places a palm on the porthole. Dr. Deering moves to match the gesture, then pulls back.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] That&#39;s not enough. It&#39;s not universal perversity. It needs to mean something more. You did all of this for him! We both did. All of it. Tell me I&#39;m wrong.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] You&#39;re wrong. Half-wrong.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] What?

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] I never did any of it for him.

= //&lt;Silence on recording.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]Dr. Reynders:[[/span]] Two minutes. I&#39;m sorry.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] What about me?

= //&lt;Dr. Deering turns away.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] Dougall? What about me? For fuck&#39;s sake, let me do it instead. You know that&#39;s the better solution.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] No. Absolutely not.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] Stop being so selfish!

= //&lt;Dr. Deering looks over his shoulder.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] It&#39;s not selfish. It&#39;s the least selfish part of this, maybe the only part that isn&#39;t. Sure, I&#39;m taking the easy way out. That&#39;s who I am. That&#39;s all I&#39;m useful for. Maybe I can find a way to do some good in there, however this works out. If I can, I&#39;ll keep trying. But I&#39;m weak and lazy and short-sighted, nothing anyone can count on, as you well know. So you need to stay out there, the way you are right now, and keep doing the real work. The good--

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] No!

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Yes. Because that&#39;s who //you// are, and nobody made you that way but you.

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] No.

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Goodbye, Amelia.

= //&lt;Dr. Deering reaches into his labcoat and palms a remote control. He steps into the loading chamber and presses a button on the device. The inner door swings shut.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] I don&#39;t forgive you.

= //&lt;A klaxon sounds as the packet delivery system audibly grinds to life.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;at&#34;]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] Are you listening? I don&#39;t forgive you. This isn&#39;t how I forgive you.

= //&lt;Dr. Deering looks up, and a flood of material obscures the inner porthole view.&gt;//

[[span class=&#34;dd&#34;]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Just a trick.

Personnel in positions with unfettered access to power, resources, and opportunities for abuse of same are governed by irrationality, individual self-aggrandizement, and interpersonal indulgence.

As clearly evidenced by this extensive report, you are deemed in major violation of various Multi-Foundation Agreement clauses, particularly those described in Sections 1 and 3 regarding transfer of information and goods with the Oracle Collective and other Metafoundation Signees. Pursuant to Section 1.4B of the Metafoundation Supertemporal Coalition Pact, your Central Normalcy Authority Iteration has been ejected from the Coalitional-Timeplane.

Any outstanding interdimensional access to the Coalitional-Timeplane has been severed. Your coverage under Goldbaker &amp; Associates is now limited per your local Provider&#39;s capabilities. Your local Temporal Authority will soon revert to pre-Coalitional status, losing any data which would allow your infiltration of the Coalitional-Timeplane, or any feasible recreation of Our services.

&gt; [[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]R:[[/span]] They did find him, you know, after a fashion. It took her a month to reverse-engineer and then adapt the old DePLExA referent seeker to pick up his Daumal signature, altered state or no, but she did it. 
&gt; 
&gt; He&#39;s still out there.

[[div class=&#34;table6&#34;]]
&gt; [[span class=&#34;mcd&#34;]]P:[[/span]] I&#39;m busy. Is there something you want?
[[/div]]

&gt; [[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]R:[[/span]] He was blundering aimlessly around in some ideospheric trash heap, in between darting in and out of time and space, looking for... well, you know what he was looking for. And you know what he&#39;s unleashed already in the process, not that you care.

[[div class=&#34;table6&#34;]]
&gt; [[span class=&#34;mcd&#34;]]P:[[/span]] You might be surprised.
[[/div]]

&gt; [[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]R:[[/span]] I&#39;m sending you the snapshot she took; I hope you take a good, long look.

[[div class=&#34;table6&#34;]]
&gt; [[span class=&#34;mcd&#34;]]P:[[/span]] What response are you looking for here? Regret? Satisfaction? 
&gt; 
&gt; You know how it goes, Ilse.
[[/div]]

&gt; [[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]R:[[/span]] You left her holding the bag. Both of you. I want you to acknowledge that.

[[div class=&#34;table6&#34;]]
&gt; [[span class=&#34;mcd&#34;]]P:[[/span]] I&#39;ve got nothing to give you. Not until this is done.
[[/div]]

&gt; [[span class=&#34;ir&#34;]]R:[[/span]] But it never will be DONE, will it?

[[div class=&#34;table6&#34;]]
&gt; [[span class=&#34;mcd&#34;]]P:[[/span]] You KNOW how it goes.

&gt; [[span class=&#34;mcd&#34;]]P:[[/span]] You play your part, and I&#39;ll play mine.
