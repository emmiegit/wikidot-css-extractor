[[tab PART 2]]
The twisted, body-shaped trees burned brightly, their arms raised to light the red skies aflame. If I needed to breathe, I would be suffocating from the heavy smoke in the air. But I could only feel the taste of ash and fruit on my tongue. From above or below the canopy, their flames provided ample cover, and places to avert his aim.

When I caught sight of the Red Dragon, my worst fear was confirmed. I still did not want to hurt him. 

We were both injured; bleeding, with a hole in my back and his left wing hanging limp, rendered unusable. I was down an arm, and he looked as if he was limping on the same leg I helped set. The fall must have worsened the compound fracture in his leg. If there was a time for diplomacy, this would be the last chance we had.

I gave him an opportunity to back away. &#34;Please, let us stop fighting; we are both injured. We do not have to hurt each other anymore. We could just... stop.&#34;

&#34;... I can&#39;t do that, Pluto.&#34;

&#34;You //can// though.&#34;

&#34;You&#39;re my mark. You can run, or fight.&#34;

&#34;//Why?// Why can you not just back away?&#34;

&#34;Because it&#39;s my job. This is all that I have left,&#34; I could hear the emotional edge in his voice that he tried to suppress. &#34;Therion took everything else.&#34;

I blinked. &#34;I thought you were only working for Father for his wealth.&#34;

&#34;Money is irrelevant.&#34; He snapped back. &#34;If I fail, I&#39;m not the Red Dragon. If I&#39;m not the Red Dragon, I&#39;m nothing.&#34;

I took a moment to process what he said. &#34;Father treats me the same way; success means everything. If you fall short of his expectations, then all you were to him was a failure. A nothing.&#34; I took a step towards him. &#34;Mother was different. Where Therion took she only gave, she gave me love that I felt he could never take away from me.&#34; 

If the Red Dragon saw that I moved forward he made no show of it, I could see the look in his eyes changing. Softening.

&#34;But he did... and now Blood Rose is all I have of Mother. I am not going to let Father take that too.&#34;

[[f&gt;image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7603/Proper.png style=&#34;width:330px;&#34;]]
&#34;You&#39;re wasting your time. Therion will win. He //always// wins.&#34; I could hear his voice breaking as he said that, he raises his rifle up to his shoulder and takes aim at me.

&#34;He will not win. I will not allow it.&#34; I clench the dagger in my only remaining hand and feel my legs tense.

&#34;Then fight.&#34; He fired, the round cutting clean through my pant-leg as I dodged to the side. He was a crack shot, but he was slipping, barely able to hold the gun steady. I noticed his aim was lower. Far lower than my head. I could tell he was aiming for my legs, in an attempt to disable me. I had one advantage over him. Land-speed. So I rushed him before he could fire yet again.

With any luck, I would sever his head before he blasted our respective feet off.

Â I closed the gap between us. Panicked and desperate, I reached out with my arm to knock his rifle out of line.

That was when I made a mistake. I had parried his rifle //downwards,// instead of //away from me.// He pulled the trigger, the shot rang out, and my leg exploded in a spray of gore. He buckled as the damage was split to his one uninjured leg, and we both fell to our knees.

I saw a single opening to even the playing field, and stabbed his wrist to pry the rifle out of his hand. My dagger found purchase in his flesh and I twisted, forcing his hand open and sending the rifle to the dirt.

Relief flooded into me. For the first time, I felt like it was possible to actually win this fight.

Until I was met with a punch to the face. Then another. Even as the bruises and cuts appeared on his own face, he simply shrugged it off. He knocked me to the ground and straddled my hips, pinning me, while he rained blow after blow against my skull, I could feel my teeth cracking in my jaw. He grabbed my head and slammed it against the ground. My vision started to swim. I felt sick and nauseous.

He made no sound as he weathered his own strikes. I saw a crack in his beak that was not there before, so I knew he was indeed hurting. But otherwise, he did not even flinch.

I did the only thing I could, and attempted to buck him over me. I slammed my only knee against his back and caused him to topple forwards. Seizing the newfound advantage this afforded me, I took the knife that I had been holding onto for dear life, and plunged it deep into his back. I pushed up with my left leg and hip and used the dagger in his back like a handle to roll him over to my right side and onto his back.

I ripped the knife out from the Red Dragon&#39;s back and aimed it towards his neck. With his legs damaged, he was unable to stop me from pressing forward or to roll me off him.

I plunged the knife downwards, and his hands come up to guard against the strike. Exhausted and desperate, I leaned my entire body weight behind my hand and press down with all my remaining strength.

And yet the Knife remained in place. Neither of us had the energy left to truly overpower the other. All we could do is continue pushing, continue fighting, waiting to see which one of us gave up first. We were waiting to see how we would hurt each other.

But I still did not want to hurt him.

So I made one last attempt to talk to him.

&#34;You were right about Therion&#34;, I looked at him square in the eyes. &#34;He is powerful. Extremely so. No single person could ever stand up against him, every single lord of hell that has tried has been butchered for his trophy room.&#34;

I felt sick thinking that mother was in there too. 

&#34;But those lords failed because they were unable to unify against him, all of them were self-serving and vainglorious like him, none of them could stand the idea of another person sharing the glory.&#34;

I could feel the strength in his arms waning.

&#34;We do not have to be like them, I know you are another victim of his, and I know you want him dead as much as I do. So I am //begging// you. Stop this fight. Let us work together to stop him from taking anything else.&#34;

His grip slowly weakened as he considered what I said. &#34;Whatever it was that Therion took from you, I promise that we can //take it back.&#34;//

&#34;If it was possible to kill Therion, what do you think stopped me?&#34; His voice came out like a harsh whisper. He sounded so tired. &#34;Even at my //strongest// it would&#39;ve been impossible to kill him. And you are still too immature and inexperienced to go against him. You can&#39;t even bring yourself to kill me. How can you expect to kill //him?&#34;//

His strength returns to his arms as I feel his grip tighten around my wrist. &#34;If you were to go against him as you are now then you would die whether or not I helped you.&#34;

&#34;I...&#34; I tried to think of a retort but I could not, despite everything that has happened I knew I did not feel truly feel comfortable with killing anyone. Even Father.

In my moment of weakness, the Red Dragon managed to push my hand to the side. He released his grip and I fell forwards and I planted the knife harmlessly in the ground next to him.

He pushed me off him, and I fell to his side. I tried to climb back on top of him until I felt his fist connecting with my skull once again. Before I could react, he grabbed me by my throat and threw me as hard as he could, sending me careening against one of the many burning trees.

I slammed my head against the trunk, and the hard crunch of bark rang through my head. It was not enough to concuss, but enough to blur my sight. When I regained my vision, I saw the Red Dragon reloading his rifle, and raising it to aim it at me.

Time slowed to a crawl. I knew where he was aiming; my last remaining arm. Even with my ability causing him to lose his own, he would still have one good arm, and I would be completely disabled. I would then attempt to crawl away, but with only one last leg and my strength completely sapped, I knew he would catch up to me. He would render me unconscious, probably with the butt of his rifle to back of my skull. And once he was healed enough to stand and limp he would drag me back to Father. 

And it would be over.

Father will win. Because Father //always// wins.

Her skull is screaming forever, locked in a glass cage.

I am sorry. I wish I could have been the son you wanted. If I were, perhaps Father would have spared you.

...Thank you.

I stared at the Red Dragon through the scope of his rifle. I knew he did not want to hurt me. But he had to. Therion took his choice away from him. But I still had the ability to choose for myself.

And in that frozen moment I made my choice.

I decided who I was going to be.

I did not want to hurt him.

But I //needed// to kill him. And no one was going to stand in my way. Not myself. Not Therion. And sadly, not even the Red Dragon.

He aimed the rifle, but I still had my dagger. I took notice of which eye he used to aim, and without hesitation, I thrust my dagger deep into my eye socket. It hurt. But I grit my teeth and pressed on twisting the knife deep into my ruined eyeball and ripped it out with all the force I could muster.

The Red Dragon flinched as his eyeball erupted into a waterfall of blood and fluid. He fires a shot and it goes wide, piercing through the burning canopy. He attempted to re-adjust, aiming with his off-eye. I try to think of a way to disable him from this range, some body part he needed that I could sever.

I looked at the stump of my right arm and regret that I had not re-directed the damage back at him when he first shot. Being right handed it would have severely effected the Red Dragon&#39;s shooting ability.

And then it hit me.

My arm was gone yes but the //stump// left behind had enough of my bicep left to cut through and sever his arm. I needed to work fast to beat his trigger pull and so I raised up my left arm up high and brought it down hard onto my mutilated appendage.

The dagger sank about half-way through my bicep before being stopped by the bone, I had hoped the acid burning it earlier would have deadened my nerves, but I was not so lucky. While my pain tolerance training was paying off, I will admit that cutting through the bone was always the hardest part to stomach.

The Red Dragon&#39;s upper arm split open and the rifle aims high, he attempts to re-adjust.

I pluck my dagger and bring it down again harder than I did before. Rage and conviction fueling me, it sinks deeper into the bone and I hear it crack. I pull it out and bring it down again. and again.

The Red Dragon fires his rifle rapidly, his shots go closer to me than before, hitting the tree behind me, the ground in front of me and once narrowly missing my head. His shots have lost their accuracy, he was erratic, he was desperate.

Afraid.

I make one last push and manage to cut through the bone and the rest of my muscle and tendon. The severed piece of my arm hits the soil below. As does the Red Dragon&#39;s right arm and rifle.

I knew it would not be enough, not for someone like him. Without a moment lost, he reached down with his left hand and brought his rifle under his armpit and attempts to hip-fire it. He could not lose this fight. He had nothing else left. It was this or //nothing.//

Just like me.

I threw my dagger to the side and pulled out Blood Rose, I stood up on my one remaining leg and lunged towards him. He fired, he missed, I heard the bullet whistle past my ear. I did not care. He could shoot me all he wants. Adrenaline washed away all the fear left in my body.

He fired, and I feel the bullet tear through the fabric of my hoodie, but it narrowly missed my flesh. When I was close enough to him I raised Blood Rose like a harpoon, its thorny body casting a shadow that eclipsed him. 

He pressed the barrel of the rifle against my chest. He pulled the trigger.

There was a click.

Blood Rose sank deep into the Red Dragon&#39;s abdomen, its vicious roots spreading throughout his body and erupting into spikes that perforated him from within. 

He fell on his back, and I pressed Blood Rose deeper in and I felt its prongs pierce through his back and into the dirt. The roots continued to grow and pinned him to the soil.

I kicked his rifle out of reach and fell to my knees. I turned my head to the side and vomited.

I won.

My hand was still shaking as I gripped tight onto Blood Rose. Not from the pain of its thorns piercing my hand, but from the adrenaline rush my body was going through. It took me a while before I noticed the Red Dragon&#39;s hand on mine.

I froze, at first. I was not ready for another fight, not so soon at least.

But instead he held my hand. &#34;Thank you.&#34;
Â 
&#34;E-Excuse me?&#34;

&#34;I never properly thanked you, back then. You stopped to heal me. Even though you were running away, you stopped to help me.&#34; His grip on my hand was weak and cold. &#34;I wanted to at the time but... I didn&#39;t. And I regret that. So, thank you.&#34;

&#34;A bit late for that, I made it worse.&#34; I let go of Blood Rose and held onto his hand.

&#34;No. //You// didn&#39;t,&#34; he winced.

&#34;Well... for whatever it is worth now, you are welcome.&#34; 

There was a pregnant pause. There had been something at the back of my head ever since I had heard of the Red Dragon. So I broke the silence.

&#34;Who were you, really? Before Therion made you into his personal assassin.&#34; I thought back to what those demons downtown said. A fallen angel? A lab experiment? My own half-brother? I needed to know because the person that I saw in front of me... was not the Red Dragon anymore. Or at least, would not be for long.

He was silent for a moment, his eyes staring deeply into mine, searching for an answer to give me. Until he found one. &#34;â¦ I&#39;m a loser,&#34; he began. &#34;My entire lifeâ¦ I was nothing but a loser. I wasted it being the pawn of a rich monster who despised my existence. I thought if I worked hard enough, pleased him well enough, that I could... mean something. Be valuable. That Therion could //make// me valuable.&#34; He turns his head to the side and looked away from me. &#34;I was wrong.&#34;

I wanted to tell him otherwise, but I could not deny his loss. And as I held his hand, I could not deny his feelings. I got the impression this is the first time he has ever //confided// in someone. At least in a long, long while. &#34;I would not call you a loser. You tried... I would sooner call you a... well. A victim.&#34;

&#34;... It doesn&#39;t matter now. Not anymore. I&#39;ve failed... and you need to finish the job.&#34;

&#34;I-it is not too late. We can still kill him together, you know. We can wait until we are whole again, replenish your ammunition, and take him out with an ambush.&#34;

&#34;... An ambush? how?&#34;

&#34;Simple. You bring me in, as if you are about to follow Therion&#39;s orders. He will make me surrender the fork. While he is distracted with that, you shoot him, and I finish what is left using Blood Rose... A fitting end for someone who originally came from the Ninth Circle.&#34; 

&#34;...I have a hideout in the city. An apartment under a pseudonym. I have a cache of ammunition there. Spare armor. Hidden in-case I ever needed it,&#34; he looked at me. &#34;Therion will not be so easily killed by a plan as simple as that. When we hit him, we need to hit //hard// and all at once, if we give him even a second to recover we&#39;re dead.&#34;
[[f&gt;image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7603/Kimaris_makes_guns_and_protein_bars.png style=&#34;width:330px;&#34;]] 

&#34;We can fine-tune the plan there, then. Therion would certainly not be expecting a surprise attack from the people he considers... &#39;failures,&#39; his words. We can use this to our advantage, all the same.&#34; I give him a confident nod, gripping his hand tighter. &#34;We can do this. Together. We just need to have trust.&#34; 

&#34;If we... fail, I expect you should know what will happen to us.&#34; I did know. A skull locked forever in a glass cage for him to leer at. Or even to play with. &#34;... Is that something you want to risk? Are you willing to sacrifice everything to kill him?&#34;

&#34;I would sooner have that than live with myself knowing I did not take my one chance fight back,&#34; I answered immediately. I felt something in my chest. Fear? Probably. But with it came a righteous determination to do whatever it took to make things better, and avenge Mother.

&#34;... Alright,&#34; he said as he let go of my hand. &#34;There&#39;s a protein bar in the pouch here&#34; he pointed at one of his pouches. It was blood stained like the rest of him, but intact. &#34;Eat it, regain some energy, and mend your wounds. Once you&#39;ve recovered enough to heal me, I&#39;ll bring you to the hideout.&#34;

I took the protein bar out his bloodied pouch and took a bite. It tasted like chocolate chip cookie dough. &#34;Thank you. I appreciate that...&#34;

&#34;I take back what I said earlier...&#34;

&#34;Mm?&#34; I tilted my head to hear him better.

&#34;Mhm, you&#39;re still young and inexperienced, yes, but...&#34;
